Flamin’ Damon: Vote for SGB!

Student Government Board member tries to ignite election awareness

Brett Taylor

News Editor

Student Government Board
member Damon Hudac wants
students to vote in today’s elec-
tion so badly that he lit himself
on ﬁre Tuesday night on the
Towers patio, just to make the
point.

Hudac likened his demon-
stration to that of the Buddhist
monks, who during the 1960s lit
themselves on fire in city streets
to protest the Vietnam War.

Hudac touched a lighter to
his rubbing-alcohol drenched
sleeve, allowing the ﬂames to
climb up his right arm.

With his arm held out to the
side and ﬂames engulﬁng his
shirt, he told the crowd of about
50 people who had circled
around him, ‘‘I feel this strongly
about you voting tomorrow.”

After 15 seconds of being
on ﬁre, Hudac called for relief,
and SGB student employee Gus

with a dripping wet towel.
He was uninjured, and the

1ong—sleeved Pittsburgh Project
T—shirt he was wearing was
hardly burned.

“I have this belief, and I
believe it’s widely held. I
believe that self immolation is
the most honorable form of
expression,” Hudac said in a
short speech that followed. “I
think [students will] show their
appreciation by voting tomor-
row.”

He said he wanted students
to understand the importance of
having their voices heard
through the SGB election.

“The Student Government
Board is responsible for allocat-
ing $600,000 of your money,”
he said. “That’s over a half a
million dollars, and you can
buy a lot of rubbing alcohol
with that.”

Last year, only 1,997 stu-
dents out of around 14,000
voted in the election. The pre-
sent board hopes to get those
numbers up to around 5,000.

It University won’t fund yearbook, it’s finished

Jake Womer

The beginning of the millenni-
um could be the end of Pitt’s yearbook.

Every year for the past ten years,
Pitt’s yearbook, “Panther Prints,” has
developed a deﬁcit of around $25,000.

Pitt’s Student Publications
Board, currently funding the yearbook,
Friday issued an ultimatum to the
University: either commit consistent
funds to the yearbook or end its publica-
tion after the 1998-1999 book.

Published since 1906, the year-
book has always required ﬁnancial help
from Pitt, according to Jim T‘ynen, year-
book adviser from 1988 to 1998.

Faced with constant deﬁcits, the
Pub Board has toyed with ceasing publi-
cation since the early 1990s. Now, it has
handed the problem to the University.

- The yearbook’s fate will likely fall to Dr.

Robert Gallagher, Vice Chancellor of
Student Aﬂairs, but he’s not too opti-
rnistic.

“I’d hate to see it go under, but I
don’t know how we’re going to fimd it,”
Gallagher said.

The 1998 book received a
$14,000 subsidy for the 1998 edition. But
the subisdy plus $30,500 in revenue and
sales won’t cover the $60,500 operating
cost. -

At a school of 25,000 students,
fewer than 500 copies of thel998 year-
book have sold.

Tynen attributes the ﬂoundering
sales to changes in college life.

“The old idea of ‘You come in,
and four years later you leave college’ is
changing,” he said.

More students are taking ﬁve to

The United States government tells
the American people it doesn’t have the
money to repair crumbling schools, only
to turn around and bail out crumbling
multibillion dollar corporations.

Nowadays, it’s the big guy versus the
little guy, and all too often, it’s the big guy
winning. .

This is the message Ralph Nadar,
America’s leading consumer advocate,
brought to Pitt last night during his more
than two—hour talk to a nearly packed
Benedum Auditorium. '

“Oligarchy is overriding democracy,”
said Nadar, explaining how corporate
America continues to rim roughshod over
democracy.

What was meant to be a lecture on
reforming political campaigns in the
United States quickly turned into an all-
out war against corporations and their
domination of the American political
process and the media.

Lambasting the media as an outlet
dedicated to the dissemination of partial
truths and sound bytes, Nadar called for
the people to get actively involved in the
process of democracy and the civic life of
their community.

“Just think what a vibrant media can

said, asking people to consider the impact
a people’s television network would have
on society. “If such mediums were avail-
able, they would transform politics.”

Nadar catapulted into the public
sphere in 1965 with his book “Unsafe at
Any Speed,” an expose of the disregard
car makers held for their customers’ safe-
ty, which led to tougher motor—vehicle
1aws._

He was recently named one of Time
magazine’s 100 most inﬂuential
Americans of the 20tl1 century because of
his role in helping to create the
Environmental Protection Agency and the
Consumer Product Safety Comrriission.
He also helped draft and pass the Safe
Drinking Water Act and the Freedom of
Infomiation Act.

“[Nadar] has devoted his life to giving
ordinary people the tools they need to
defend themselves,” said Robert Hazo,
director of Pitt’s American Experience
Distinguished Lecture Series, which co-
sponsored Nadar’s visit with the Alumni
Association and the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs. “He cer-
tainly knows how to tap the well of ideal-
ism.”

institution and consequently less attract-

Pitt. Indiana University of Pennsylvania,

That doesn’t, however, condemn

absence to be ridiculous. The Oklahoma

lication.

scraping the book in favor of a less

exspensive CD—rom format, but the evo-
lution of technology could soon make it
obsolete and inaccessible.

I “Everybody would like to see it
continue, I think, [but it] seems students
aren’t interested,” he said.

Director of Student Activities
Joe Cavalla has been paying off the year-
book’s deﬁcit for the last three years.
Although he sees Panther Prints as a
good historical reference, he said it can-
not continue “losing money and money
and money and money and money.”

“I commend the board for saying

‘Hey, let’s get off the dime and find a way
to fund this,”’ he said. “How much
importance do you put on a yearbook?”

Panther Prints Editor Corrine
Rushkowski sees it differently.

“It’s a sony state to see that there
can be any debate over one of the only
historical records at Pitt,” she said. “The
University should definitely give us a
subsidy. They’re not going to have any-
thing to look back on if they don’t.”

But shesaid the potentially ﬁnal
Pitt" yearbook will have one of the best
covers in years. “If the yearbook’s going
out, it’s going out with a bang.”

Terry Lucas, the yearbook and
Pitt News advisor, said the University
should fund it since it’s more for the uni-
versity than for students at this point.

“Students of the here and now
don’t really appreciate what the yearbook
can give to them,” Lucas said.

Lucas recalled an alumus having
a picnic with 20 friends from Pitt’s class
of 1980. The man came back twice to get
enough yearbooks for them. He thought
the memories would make a nice gift.

“[It would be] bad for alumni
who want to recapture their good years
here at the University of Pittsburgh,”
Lucas said of the possible axing of the
book.

Lucas, Tynen and Cavalla
agreed the yearbook should be funded up
front so students can concentrate on the
product and not desperately worry about
the ﬁnances. Tynen said those 400 to 500
students who want the yearbook should
have it.

“[The costs are] worth it for'me,”
Tynen said. .

answers.

agenda to include such issues as crime, the

It is urgent that America force a

“How do you give ﬂedgling political
initiatives a chance without a chance?”
Nadar said, speaking to the fact that third-
party candidates are often excluded from
commercial mass media because they
don’t have the money to afford radio and
television campaign ads.

Nadar also said state governments
often make it hard for third parties to get

thousands of voter signatures.

In Utah, 5,000 signatures are needed,
and in Pennsylvania, legislators at one
time tried to make it 99,000, he said.

I ; BOARD CANDll)ATES

The eight SGB members each earn a
salary of approximately $125 per month.

Gerald Bergen ,

Bergen said an eviction from his apart-
ment and the subsequent legal battle with
his ex-landlord helped him decide to run
for SGB. If elected, said he would publicize

j the University’s legal assistance programs

and establish a “clearinghouse” of infom1a-
tion about bad landlords that students could
use as a reference. '
Bergen said he would also promote the
concerns of oﬂ’-campus students. He said

he would like to see expanded shuttle ser- A

vice and perhaps a shuttle into Squirrel

of his goals. .

LJ.LaCasse I
One of LaCasse’s primary campaign

7 issues has been campus safety. She said

students need to  made more awareof
Oakland’s dangerous areas and of
resources available to them to help them
stay safe.

LaCasse has also endorsed a spring
activities fair, since she said the fall semes-
ter can be overwhelming to freshmen, who
might not join a campus organization right
away.

She said she would try to improve ser-
vices to transfer students, too. Pitt is attract-
ing more transfers, and LaCasse said their
needs must be met. '

4. Dave Lander

Lander said he would like to see QPAs
rise in value and a greater selection of
courses created. . - ’

Lander said he wants SGB to offer

 seminars to discuss alcohol awareness and

He said he also wants to make sure all

 students and organizations take part in

“We are all Pitt. We are all Panthers,”

he said. A “We should all know that and

Safula Lewis

Lewis said she is not satisﬁed with the
quality of the academic and social life at
Pitt. Rather than complain about ﬂue prob-
lerns she sees, she said she decided to run
for SGB, where she could alfect positive

_ change directly.

She wants to see better communication
between students and their government.

Another goal is for the University to
have better access city resources by, for
example, bringing concerts to campus.

Lewis also wants to see a more enthu-
siastic campus.

said.

Markques McKnight

Student leaders should actively seek to
know the students they serve, McKnight
said. As such, he said he would advocate
that SGB members canvass the campus
periodically to talk with students, getting to
know them and their concerns.

McKnight said he would also like to
broaden the Multicultural Committee to
make it more representative of Pitt’s
diverse ethnic make up.

His other issues include safety con-
cerns, expanding Van Call’s service and
library hours, housing, the admissions
process, and loan-ﬁee ﬁnancial aid.

Raymond Murphy

Murphy said he wants SGB members"

to be more approachable so students are
more likely to communicate with them.
'I‘hat’s important, he said, because SGB can
only be effective if students support it by
keeping in contact.‘ -
Campus safety and discrimination are
issues keeping him “up at night,” said

~Murphy, who is co-president of the

Rainbow Alliance. He has pledged to make

campus safer and more accepting. L
~Murphy also pledged to work on meal

plans, better heating. in residencehalls and

“It’s all about progress an'dpride,” she

a better process for matching roommates.

Julie Radford

Communication is also a primary
objective for Radford. She said SGB must
have the vision to seek and attend to stu-
dents’ needs.

Radford discussed a weekly newsletter
to keep students apprised of SGB activity.
She also promoted using Pitt TV, of which
she is the director, to broadcast inforrna-
tion. -

As chairwoman of SGB’s
Governmental Relations Committee,
Radford registered 1,000 students to vote in
the national election. She said she lmows
how to communicate and accomplish
goals. "

“I will make your vision of Pitt’s cam-
pus a reality,” she said. ‘

Ted Rodgers .

SGB members must be the students’
voice, Rodgers said, and must keep an
open-door policy to all students. It’s "one of
SGB’s most important functions, he said.

Rodgers said blocks-per-semester

meal plans must be reinstated, and there

must be better food quality. .
He said he also wants to expand SGB’s
ad—hoc Alcohol Awareness Committee. He
said he wants to see alcohol awareness
become a part of student orientation, since
alcohol is readily available in Oaldand.

Nicole Showalter

Showalter, the president of the
Campus Women’s Organization, said she
wants SGB to be more inclusive. The
board, she said, must recognize and act on
the fact that not all students are the same.

Students arenot suﬂiciently aware of
SGB and what the board does, she said.
Showalter wants to make the board more
visible and more accountable for its
actions.

Campus safety and Pitt’s “woefully
inadequate” food- services must be
improved, she said. Showalter would also‘

work to improve" the admissions and allo-

cations processes.

Joan Snyder

Snyder wants to compile and publish
crime statistics. That, she said, would help
them stay safe. Expanding the Van Call ser-
vice would also improve safety, she said.

Snyder said she also wants to develop
a series of weekly programs to address
issues such as team-building, diversity and
unity among student organizations.

Students can work together to achieve
the things that are important to them, she
said.

“We all have [goals], and we all pro-
mote them,” Snyder said.

Michael Tannous -

VV1th a caution that he was “not going
to prorrrise the world,” Tarmous said he
would target student alienation. All stu-
dents, he said, must have an equal opportu-
nityto voice their opinions.

As such, he said he would set up com-
plaint boxes around campus. Having stu-
dent input would give SGB an opportunity
to work “side by side” with students, he
said.

Tarmous also said he wants to extend
Hillman Library’s Sunday hours until 2
a.m. He said he wants to increase the
Sunday frequency of Pitt shuttles to one
every half hour.

Mike Unangst

Unangst said he would try to ensure
that all faculty can speak English ﬂuently,
relate to students and put education before
research.

“It seems we have some faculty who
are great researchers but not-so-great teach-
ers,” Unangst said.

SGB also must promote diversity
around campus, “because there’s no ques-
tion that it’s something that needs done,” he
said.

Unangst said he would also work to
improve student safety, especially in North

Oakland, where he said the crime rate is ris-

ing faster than in South Oakland.

EDITORIAL

SGB election 1998:

If you want change, it will not be
brought about by sitting quietly and
doing nothing. Today, three Student
Government Board presidential candi-
datesand 12 boardcandidateswilltryto
enact change. It is up to you to go out
and make an informed decision and
vote for the candidate who you feel will
bring positive change.

VVrth this in mind, here are the can-
didates The Pitt News endorses, and
why.

_ - For SGB president, we endorse
George Mongell. During the past year,
he has shown that he is a capable stu-
dent leader. As chairman of the student
government ‘ Academic Affairs
Committee, he has implemented the
Internet Bookswap program and lob-
bied to raise the value of a B+ to 3.33
quality points.

Even though he lost the election last
year as a board candidate, he has
accomplished in a non-board position
what he strove to do as a board member.

The Pitt News endorses the follow-
ing candidates for SGB (in alphabetical
order):

0 LJ. LaCasse: LaCasse appears to
have good ideas relating to transfer stu-
dents, a group not mentioned by many‘
candidates. '

0 Dave Lander: Lander is dedicat-
ed, persistent and vocal about what he
wants to accomplish. His tenacity is
suited for an SGB member.

- Safula  Lewis is strong-

our endorsements

headed and not aﬁaid to say what needs
to be said. She does not appear to be the
kind of person who would back down
without a ﬁght. ‘ '

0 Markgues McKnight: A--"dazzling
resume is the ﬁrst thingthat impresses
us about McKnight. He isia business-
man and a half. He also has ‘leadership
experience with the Black Action
Society.

- Ray Murphy: As many others
have said, Murphy is the breath of fresh
air that SGB needs. He is level-headed
and has done a great job leading the
Rainbow Alliance, one of the most con-
troversial student groups on campus.

- L@;  Registering more
than 1,000 students to vote is "no
insigniﬁcant feat. Radford has experi-
ence with SGB and has a long list of
accomplishments that validate her can-
didacy.‘ _

- Joan Snyder“. Snyder’s plans for
SGB are laid out well, organized and
speciﬁc. Snyder has very detailed plans
that look very good.

0 Mike Unangst: Unangst has the
ability to make an idea that sounds near-
ly impossible, plausible —— namely, the
plan to acquire blue-light posts in
Oakland.

George Mongell is our choice for
SGB president, and the aforementioned
candidates are the eight candidates we’d
like to see on next year’s board.

Please take the opporttmity to vote;
let your voice be heard.

Wrestling and soups: Ct moronic tag team

I’ve been sick recently, and I’ve been
watching more television because of it. I hope I
get better soon. Oh, sure, Pd like to feel well
again, but it’s the television; I just can’t take it
any more.

Two types of programs bother me the most:

soap operas and wresﬂing events. It’s ‘not

because they bore me to-tears and force me to
criticize Darwin’s theory; it’s because I must
contemplate those who schedule their lives
around these shows and glorify‘ the sex and vio-
lence therein. 4 ”

. You’ve seen them. They’re the ones wear-
ing those “Austin 3:16” shirts that might as well
say, “lVIe arns stupid” They are the ones talking
with their ﬁiends about whether Santiago and

Bundy, Hulk Hogan and “Macho Man” Randy
Savage. Actually, they’re still around, but the
steroid use didn’t wear on them as much then. I
saw the “wresﬂing” that night, extremely fake
punches and all. p

I’m sure someone will take time out front
his or her Thursday Thunder party to tell me that
it’s much more realistic and aggressive these
days. But still, I wonder: If you know it’s fake,
why watch it‘? That’s like watching an educa-
tional ﬁlm reel about equine reproduction per-

Yes, this mindless drivel is addictive. It sat-

daily basis. Did I say people? I meant the imma-

Wrestling has an audience of boyish men
who wish they could be the ones in the ring (“I
just need to work out a little,” they think) and
women who are, or wish to be, their girlﬁiends.
Soap operas are enjoyed thoroughly by women
ranging in age from hopeful to regretful, just
happy to live an exciting life by proxy. They
watch, glued to the screen, while they do
accounting «or laundry; the phone is ﬁrmly
mounted to their ear, and a friend is on the other

way to hit someone with a chair. The best a soap
opera can do is come up with anew way to have
someone come back from the dead. Actually, as
I mentioned above, “Days of Our Lives” has
tried some weird stories such as Satanic posses-
sion and time traveling, but it’s always so melo-
dramatic and poorly done. It’s a joke, but the
women continue to watch, mentioning it in class
or at work the next day, eyes wide with aston-
ishment at the previous day’s on-screen tryst

.It’s the type of programming that catches
your eye as you’re ﬂipping through channels‘

looking for something with a story line, or sortie
other sign of value. It’s the type you stop and
watch, amazed that oﬂrers check their local list-
ings for show times. It’s the type you make fun
of, sarcastically vouching for its relevance to
society. These reactions are ﬁne and sane.

Just don’t get caught up. They’ll lower your
intelligence quotient.

The Fiber

‘Kevin Carey

Columnist

‘This past weekend, I found myself
trapped somewhere between “Groundhog
Day” and “P1easantville,” on the quaint
campus of Kenyon College in Gambier,
Ohio, inthe heart of Amish country.

Iwasaninterloper—actually, adrunk-

en fool walking about with no particular .

destination or cause. The campus (the
Harvard of Ohio, as I refer to it) plays col-
lege to some 1,600 students. It’s a liberal arts
school with a very limited diet of mosﬂy
Eddie Bauer and J. Crew laddies of gold-
card status. ‘

The purpose of the visit was to generate
new ideas While catching up with some
friends. ' P

But, oh, how I sincerely missed S011tl'l
Oakland, praying to return in time for the
Student Government Board elections.

Imadeitintirne andhadafewdaysto
decide whom I’d vote for, so I did some
extensive research on the candidates.

As for SGB presidential race:

Christopher Boback became involved
with SGB shortly after his ﬁeshman year.
Since then, he has driven to put student gov-
emrnent back into the hands of the students,
or possibly place students into hishands.

George Mongell, very likely the most
qualiﬁed candidate, seems to be the future
victor of this election. ‘His edge is being a
politician already. This is clearly seen in his
slate and slogan, “Your Voice” with Julie
Radford and Joan Snyder. My question is:
Do I get to hear my voice with those two
‘ e” candidates, or do I get to hear his
voice? ‘ '

Shavon Ogunleye, the last of the presi-
dential candidates, should most likely carry
the minority vote, being president of the
Black Action Society and an active member

of the Some. of God’s Children Gospel‘

choir. For those of you who want good ol’
Christian righteousness in the house, by all
means, swing your vote her way.

witnessed them, then by all means, run your
ass away from his lever.

- Safula Lewis’ propaganda is short and
sweet in fashion; I suppose her status is up
in the air.

Markques Y. McKnight’s slogan ends
with “Mobilize and Empower.” I’m almost
positive those are borrowed lines, so on that
alone I question his integrity. However, he
does remind me of director Spike Lee. So
on that note, it will come down to a coin
toss. i
That cat Ray Murphy has my vote.
Murphy, the co-president of the Rainbow
Alliance, demonstrates character, being an
Irish gay candidate —— a courageous status
to live up to in any Irish family.

If Mongell says Julie Radford’s OK
(He is a fraternity member), then she has my
vote.

Ted Rodgers has scarier eyes than Fred
Rogers (no relation). The eyes plus his back-
ground in neuroscience do not make a good
combination.

I deﬁnitely support the feminist cause;
however, nowadays, I begin to wonder what
the cause is. Therefore, Nikki Showalter’s
ambitions will be more devastating than
productive. '

As with Radford, if Mongell says Joan
Snyder’s OK, so do I. However,_I still want
to know if it will be my voice.

Michael Tarmous seems educated
enough. However, I ﬁnd that his lack of
social involvement would slight him as far

‘as the imperative element of politics — '

communication — is concerned.

Mike Unangst — a politics and philos-
ophy and business major — is a walking
paradox. ,

But maybe his “unquestionable comrnit—
ment to Pitt Students” will carry him
through. .

Carey encourages all to get out and vote.

Hoops could
heal all wounds

For us Pitt fans, this football season
has been heartbreaking. It felt like
when your dream date stands you up at
the prom or when your cute little puppy
gets run over by a car.

You can’t really blame the players
or the coaches for the lousy season; the
Pitt program is just young and develop-
ing. The talent and experience just isn’t
here.

But that doesn’t make the pain and
frustration any easier to deal with. Die-
hard Pitt fans have suffered for most of
the decade, with the team a constant
source of embarrassment. There were a
ton of losses, but they were more than
just losses.

9 A 72-0 loss is more than just a loss,
it’s a humiliation. _

Then last year, ﬁnally, Pitt" was
good.’ Damn good.

We cheered as we slaughtered a
team -—sure it . was Southwest
Louisiana, but the experience was
something new. We cheered as we
played then-No. 1 Penn State
admirably on its home turf.

We cheered even louder when we

 

beat Miami on Homecoming. Then, .
when Pitt beat Virginia Tech and West

Virginia, we had a legitimate reason to
celebrate. We were going 'to a bowl
game.

Finally, our years of suffering with
awretched program had given us rea-
son to be proud.

But then this year happened. And‘

although there is plenty of evidence to
suggest the football program will be
powerful in the next several years, that
didn’t ease the pain this year.
‘ But you know what might? Th

basketball team. ‘

Pitt basketball is predicted to finish '

in the middle of the Big East.-Not great,
not awful. But predictions don’t mean a
dung.

Last year, the football team was
-predicted to win only one or two
games‘, and you know what happened
there. This year, the basketball team has
a legitimate shot at making the NCAA
tournament (something that hasn’t hap-
pened since 1992).

A little March Madness could gen-
erate as much excitement as last year’s
Liberty Bowl berth. And what’s even
better is that it’s more likely.

Vonteego Cummings is one of the
best point guards in the country. He’s
hurt right now, but he will be what car-
ries Pitt into the postseason.

The Panthers welcomed Vonteego
Cummings back into the lineup
Tuesday night, and they easily handled
St.Francis (Pa.), 95-69, at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

Cummings, _along with Ricardo
Greer, led Pitt with 21 points each.

' “I was rusty, but once the game
started I got into it,” Cummings said
after the game.

The senior guard started the game
—— to his surprise — and led the
Panthers with five assists.

Coach Ralph Willard said, “He had
practiced all day [Monday] and
Sunday, so he was ready to play.”

The visiting Red Flash controlled

' the beginning of the game, taking a 20-

15 lead midway through the first half.
St.Francis used strong transition bas-
kets, outhustling the Panthers and mov-

ing the ball quickly. Soon after, howev-
er, Pitt came to life and never looked
back, going on a 9-0 run to take its first
lead of the game.

Jarrett Lockhart, who finished with
19 points, hit three of his ﬁve three-
pointers toward the end of the first half
to increase Pitt’s lead to as much as 23.
The Red Flash were able to cut the lead
to’49-35 at the break with a 7-0 run of
their own.

Both teams shot well in the first
half, but Willard was unimpressed with
his defense.

“We did not play with the neces-
sary focus,” Willard said. “We know
we can score, but we have to be able to
defend. When we are on the road in a
hostile environment, the defense will
have to step up.”    - »

Traci Waites debuts at Pitt

Brad Cuprik
Staff Wrlter

The wornen’s basketball team will need
only a handful of victories to improve upon
last year’s 6-21 record, but the excitement
level has deﬁnitely increased.‘

The Lady Panthers enter ‘this season
with a new head coach, Traci Waites. This is
Waites’ ﬁrst Division I head coaching job,
after she worked atAiizona the past ﬁve sea-
sons as both an assistant coach and an asso-
ciate head coach.

When Waites was hired on April 13,
she was as excited then about the season as
she is now, with the season already two
games old.

The Georgia native said, “I really want
to give these young women theopportunity
to understand what it means to win and have
flllll”

When asked about the possible success
or failure of the team, Waites added, “I
believe our program has the potential to
achieve great success, both nationally and in
the Big East Conference.”

There is little doubt that Waites has the
necessary background to pass on to her
players. During her playing years at both the
University of Georgia and Long Beach
State, she was a member of Final Four
teams. Waites also earned a]l—conference

turnovers. Isaac Hawkins dominated
the glass, picking up 10 of his 14 points
to go along with five of his 10 rebounds
for the 11th double-double of his
career.

St. Francis did cut the Pitt lead to
eight when Tom Fox hit an uncontested
three off an inbounds pass. After a

For the past three years,
injuries and unexpected player
departures have severely ham-
pered the development of the Pit
basketball program. K

Last year, the Panthers often

I played with only seven scholarship

players, leaving coach Ralph

I Wllard with little to choose from

on the youngest team in Big East
history.

The 1998-99 season appears
to be the exact opposite. Every
starter has returned, and there are
quality newcomers on the bench
who can play with the Division I
competition. Perhaps the most
important returning player is

 senior Vonteego Cummings, who

led the Panthers in almost every

statistical category last year.
Cummings, a 6-5, 190-pound

guard, will once again lead the Pitt

’ backcourt. In his remarkable junior

season, Cummings ranked third in
the Big East conference in scoring,
and second in assists and steals --
the only player to rank among the

 top three in each category. He also

averaged an unbelievable 40.1
minutes per game last season,
which proved the Panthers’ lack of

season, Cummings
should be fresher than ever with
the addition of junior point guard
Jeremy Holmes, who will spell
Cummings at times and allow him

 

Thanksgiving break.

Holmes is a transfer ﬁom
Neosho Community College in
Kansas, whereheledhisteamtoa
27-5 record this past season. His
leadership and passing skills
should dramatically help the
Panthers, who desperately need
someone to relieve Cummings
ﬁ'om time to time.

Also returning to the back-
court this year are juniors Jarrett
Lockhart and Kellii Taylor, and
sophomore Ricardo Greer.
Lockhart experienced a break-
through season last year, making
himself known as a shooting
weapon. There are times when
Lockhart can become a streaky
shooter, which will attract defend-
ers and free up others on the court.
His presence as a scorer is invalu-
able to the Panthers.

Taylor was hampered by a
nagging foot injury for most of last
season, "which resulted in him
playing just 10 games.,He appears
to be back to full health this season
and is expected to retum to the
fonn he had in his freshman year,
when he ﬁnished third in the
nation with 3.2 steals per game -
totaling 101 steals on the season
and breaking the old Pitt record.

While Taylor sat out most of
the season with foot problems,
Greer was making a name for him-
self. He started all 27 games last
year and was named to the Big
East’s All—Rookie Team. At 6-5
and 200 pounds, Greer can play

 

    

Panthers because
he can relieve just
about any player
on the court.

Closing out
the backcourt will
be freshmen Fred
Primus and Jason
Boyd. Primus was
listed as the ninth-
best shooting
guard coming out
of high school by
PrepStar maga-
zine. The 6-3
guard from
Washington, D.C.,
is dangerous from
three—point land
and will serve as a,
deadly tandem
with Lockhart. His
shooting ability
gives the Panthers’
some outside
weapons they
haven’t had in a
long time.

In the ﬁont- 
court for the 5
Panthers will be
four key players:
junior Isaac 

Hawkins, sophomores Attila

Cosby and Stephen Flores, and_

freshnran Clnis Seabrooks.
Hawkins turned many heads

last year, as he improved greatly,

especially on the boards, where he

' led all players in the Big East with

9.7 rebounds per game. At 6-8,

lished himself as a
shot blocker with
53, which was sec-
ond in the league.

Flores, 6-8, is
another returning
forward who will
most‘ likely come
off the bench again
this year. He played
26 games last year
and contributed

His skills have paid oﬂ° immediately,
earning him 19 assists in two exhibition
games and four against Maryland-Baltimore

The Big East has many surprises

$

in store for the nation

Jay Yander
Staff Writer

Despite weak showings in the past few
seasons, the Big East is back this year with
three of the top 15 players in the nation.

Many argue that the Big East not only
possesses the best team in the nation with
Connecticut, but also college basketball’s
best player in Connecticut’s Richard
Hamilton.

The rest of the conference isn’t that
simple, but I hope I can simplify the picture
with the following preview.

1. Connecticut — UConn‘ returns all ﬁve
starters from last year’s NCAA ﬁnal eight
appearance.

Among those returning are Hamilton,
last season’s Big East Player of the Year,
and reigning conference Rookie of the Year
Khalid El-Amin. Head coach Jim Calhoun
does have a problem, though — he must
motivate a team that fell short last season.
Does this team have the force to take it to
the next level?

2. Syracuse — SU has only one senior this
season, making next season appear very
promising. But the team shouldn’t look so
far ahead; the Orangemen have a solid
nucleus to work around. Three returning
starters — EtanThomas, Ryan Blackwell
and Jason Hart — make up a talented core
for head coach Jim Boeheirn to work
around. After that, though, SU may strug-

gle.

3. St. John’ — Mike Jarvis comes to
-Queens as" the third coach since Lou
Camesecca retired in 1992. The hardest
thing for Jarvis to do is get his troops
regrouped after the off—season changes.
And he will. The Red Stonn have a talent-
ed core of returning upperclassmen and-an
impressive recruiting class.

St. John’s will look to freshman Erick
Barkley to run the point and balance the
remaining starting lineup, made up of the
front line of Ron Artest, Tyrone Grant and
Albert Richardson. Also returning is atypi-
cal two-guard Lavor Postell. He rebounds
(more than ﬁve a game last season), he’s a
slasher, and he’s a defensive menace.

4. Miami - The Hurricanes lost only one
starter from last year’s NCAA Tournament
team and return all-conference forward Tim
James, who must step up and become the
leader of this team. It shouldn’t be a prob-
lem for a player who led the Big East in
rebounding in 1998. Head coach Leonard
Hamilton has his ﬁont line set with all three
starters returning from last year’s squad.
Harnilton’s main concern is the vacant
'point—guard spot, previously occupied by
four-year starter Kevin-Nonis. New point-
guard possibilities include ﬁeshmen
Michael Simmons and Paulo Coelho, and

juniors Vernon Jennings and Johnny

Hemsley likely will time at the two-guard ,

position.

5. Pitt — Head coach Ralph Wﬂlard once
again has too many shooting guards and no
true point guards. Junior—college transfer
Jeremy Holmes is listed as a point guard,
but his ball control leaves something to be
desired. Holmes will take the pressure and
workload off Vonteego Cummings, but the
Panthers will still rely on Cummings to
handle the ball more than half of the time.

In order for the Panthers to be compet-
itive in the conference, they must remain
healthy —— which they haven’t been able to
do for several years. W1llard’s front line
includes all three returning starters: Isaac
Hawkins, Attila Cosby and Ricardo Greer.

Cummings is one of the best all-around
players in the conference, but without a
supporting cast like Connecticut’s
Hamilton has, he will fall short in the vot-
ing for Big East Player of the Year.

6. Rutgers — Lack of height has troubled
the Scarlet Knights in recent years, and it
will trouble them once again this season.
Head coach Kevin Bannon looks to
Alvydas Tenys to anchor the ﬁontoourt
along with Rob Hodgson and Jeﬁ Greer.
Greer adds another three-point shooter to a
Rutgers team ' ﬁlled with long-distance
threats.

Geoﬂ’ Billet and Earl Johnson may
combine to make up the best backcourt in
the conference. Both can play either the
point or two-guard. Billet is the best shoot-
er on the team, but Johnson can shoot when
needed.

7. Providence — The Friars return all ﬁve
starters from last year. That should lighten
the load for new head coach Tim Welsh,
who led Iona to a 27-6 record in 1997-98.
The highest pn°ority.for Providence is to
establish a center, but if that isn’t possible,
Welsh will have to go to a system with three
forwards. That system will be led by all-
conference candidate Jamel Thomas, a
solid scorer and rebounder, along with,
Erron Maxey, a tough defender, and Justin
Farley.

8. Villanova - When a shooting guard is
second in rebounding on your team, you
know you have a problem. T'hat’s just the
problem head coach Steve Lappas is look-
ing at. The Wﬂdcats’ interior play must
improve if ‘Nova is going anywhere this
season. Big men Malik Allen and Rafal
Bigus have improved since lastyear but
still have problems with defending quicker
forwards. In a conference where quickness
reigns, the Cats could have a tough year.

9. ‘Georgetown — Head coach John

thatl wasn’t ready for the NBA,” Cummings said ‘T feel
like I can compete with those guys, but I’m not at the
point where I can control everything I do every night, and
that’s where I want to be.” '

Willard believes that Cummings’ decision to stay in
school has drastically improved his future career in bas-
ketball. A - ~
‘ e’s recognized some of the emotional, physical,
and educational standpointsof the game, and I think he’s
going to be rewarded very handsomely for that,” Willard
said “I think he’s going to be a very high draft pick this
year if not a lottery pick  That’s how good I think he is
now.”
Many wonder what those critics who expected
Cummings to retum to Thomson, Ga, after a year away
are saying now. '

“Those people changed now,” Ctmrmings said
“Everybody loves me back home. Not just my family,
but the whole community. They watch me on TV and
embrace me when I come back home.” ’

illardis onemanwhowas morethanhappyto
erribrace Cummings before and after his deci-
, sion to attend Pitt.

“He was a great athlete,” Willard said “We had
envisioned playing the style of play that we had at
Western Kentucky. It was a pressing, up-tempo style of
play, and with his quickness and athleticism, I thought
he’d be perfect in our system”

Cummings was selected as the 1995-96 Big East
Preseason Rookie of the Year, but his playing days start-
edoffonrocky groundwhenheﬁacturedhishandin
practice. He was forced to miss nine straight games, but

Since becoming -a team leader in his sophomore

- M year, Cummings has steadily become one of the best all-

around players in the nation. He has taken over the point-
guardduties andhasguidedhisteam.Instartingall33
games his sophomore year, Cummings led the team in
scoring, assists and average minutes played in a game.

The team compiled a 17-14 record and earned a bid in

the NIT.

The rebuilding process began once again last year.
Because of injuries and defections, Cummings was the
team’s only veteran He took over his duty as ﬂoor gen-
eral, again leading the team in scoring, assists, steals and

. minutes played in his junior year. In fact, he played every

rriiriute of Pitt’s ﬁnal seven games, including a double-
overtime game against Villanova in the Big East

_ Tournament." He ﬁnished the season by averaging 40.1

minutes per game, a new Big East record

is performance was rewarded with his selection

to the All—Big East Team for the second year in a

w. Although the season was over for Pitt,

Cummings got some extra playing days over the sum-

mer when he was invited to try out for Team USA for the
PanAmerican Games.

“To get a chance to try out for a team that represents
your country, I think that’s a great honor,” Cummings
said‘“I’m glad I was in a position where the coaches
thought that I was good enough to go to the trials, and I
feel that I played well out there.”

Cummings’ honors include being named an All-
America candidate and one of the 25 candidates for the
John R Wooden Player of the Year Award

“It’s just a list to me,«but I’m glad that the people
who make this list thought I was good enough to be one

of the candidates,” he said “The thing that is most impor-’

tanttomeattlie endofthe seasonis, How didmyteam
do?” ' , ’

The 1998-99 season looks to be a good one for the
Panthers, who have every starter returning and will ﬁnal-
ly-have some depth on the bench.

“Whatever it takes, that’s what I’ll do,” Cummings
said ‘Thatmaynotmean scorethisyear.Thatmaybe
me giving up the ball a lot. That may be me rebounding,
getting steals — doing whatever it takes to win.”

Every day in practice, Willard recognizes the impor-
tance of having Cummings back for his ﬁnal year.

“I-Ie’s a great kid, a great leader,” Willard said “You
want the guy handling the ball on the same page as the
coach, and now it’s to the point where I go to correct him
in practice and he’ll stop me and tell me what he did
wrong.”

The recognition of his own mistakes just goes to
show how much Cummings has matured in his four
years at Pitt. ’ ‘

“I’ve only improved since I’ve been here,”
Cummings said “I’ve improved in stealing the ball, pass-
ing the ball, whatever it takes. I have conﬁdence because
Coach Willard has conﬁdence in me. He gave me the

I rock and said, ‘Vonteego, this is your team. You run the

The individual success is not what concerns
Cummings, though. All his hard work and time spent
wiﬂi his teammates was not just for himself, but for the
team and the University, and when it’s all said and done,
Cummings has just one simple desire:

where she had been an assistant since
1994. Assistant coaches Jennifer Britton
_and Kate Galligan are also in their first
year of coaching the Lady Panthers.

The team is left with four healthy
seniors. Alecia Balich returns at forward
and will be counted on to play a lot of
minutes. Balich had her best season last
year, appearing in all 27 games and lead-
ing the Panthers with 229 points. She has
led the team in three—point shooting for
the past two seasons.

Balich worked on her game in the
off—season as part of the Big East/Nike
All-Star team in Austria and the Czech
Republic. She is joined in the frontcourt
by 6-foot—2—inch senior Kortni Webb,
who also played in all 27 games last year,
starting in ﬁve of them. Webb’s rebound
ability may be her strongest asset, as she
averaged 2.3 rebounds a game last sea-

leading rebounder last season and led the
Big East Conference in blocks. Her
defense isn’t her only strength, however;
she recorded 24 points in a game against
a strong Penn State team last season.

The only other senior in the front-
court is Nicole Whitworth,’ who is critical
to the Panthers’ success. She will be

spelling both Balich and Webb. Along
with Whitworth, LaTonya Lawrence, a
junior, and Brooke Hyman, one of three
freshmen on the team, will get time at

The backcourt returns one senior,
LaTonya Blanton, who was second on

the team in assists and fourth in steals last .

season. In her debut with the Panthers
last season after transferring from Florida
Community College, she ranked 12th in
the Big East in assist—tumover ratio.

She will be joined by junior Michelle
Katkowski, who recorded a career-best

Lady Panthers lose their two star players

Ashley George
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
_team was faced with a huge prob-
lem this season when it lost two
valuable players. The team had to
say goodbye to Gina Montesano

and Latia Howard because of

career—threatening injuries to both
women.

“We’ll miss them,” said head
coach Traci Waites. “They brought
a lot of experience to the court. For
right now, we are going to have to
play with the cards we were dealt.”

Both Montesano and Howard

are seniors this year. The two have

been getting playing time since

their freshman year, so their
absence will aifect the team in
many ways.

Howard suffered a stroke in

September after having open-heart
surgery last year. The stroke left her
right side paralyzed, but she has
regained full use of her body.
Montesano decided to redshirt
this season on Aug. 17 because a
knee injury left her unable to play a
full season of basketball.
Montesano underwent her
second knee surgery on April 27
due to tom cartilage that could not
be left unﬁxed. The
second surgery con-
sisted of a total
reconstruction,
which was much
more painfulthanher
ﬁrst surgery, which
was a scope that
found tom cartilage
"in her knee. She was
told she would be
able to play during
her sophomore sea-
son after the surgery,
but that prediction
was later rescinded.
Montesano sat
‘out her sophomore
campaign but

 

‘I'll : 

  
    

returned for her junior year, playing
in a great deal of pain.

At the end of that season, she
decided to have the second surgery.

Montesano had a hole in her
cartilage about the size of two
thumbnails. The hole was plugged
with the cartilage from another part
of her knee. The reconstruction left
her on crutches for eight weeks,
and sheis still limitedinwhat she is ‘
allowed to do physically. Her reha-
bilitation is a gradual process, but
Montesano is looking forward to
participating in basketball practices
in the future.

“It’s difﬁcult . right now
because I still try to participate in
some drills with the team. Coach
Waites is helping me to mentally
take control of what I am dealing
with,” said Montesano.

“It’s frustrating when I have to
watch from the sidelines because I
want to be out there. I’m going to
take this as a learning experience
because I still consider myself part _

of ﬂie team.”

Montesano is not giving up on

‘basketball. She still attends most

practices and ‘all of the games.

She is permitted to run now,
and during the beginning of her
therapy, she rode an exercise bike
to build up her strength. Montesano
does believe, however, that this is

going to be a setback in her game.
“It’s going to be a big sum-
mer,” said Montesano, who will
have to spend the summer getting
in shape for next season. “All of
my teammates have been playing
the whole year, so that leaves me
with a lot of catching up to do. I’m
missing out on a lot of basketball-
oriented drills, and I feel as ifI am

going to have to learn how to play"

the game all over again.”

~ ~. Outside of school, Montesano
is working at a basketball intem—
ship where she coaches 5- to 12-
year—old boys. This helps her with
her major in elementary education,
for which she plans to attend grad-
uate school at Pitt next" year.

. Because of the redshirt, Montesano

still has one more year to play for
the Panthers, so she is looking for-
ward to getting back on the court
again.

Howard, on the other hand,
may never play on a basketball

court again. For a player who was

looking ahead to the WNBA,
Howard’s stroke in September was
a setback in her life. She found out
two weeks ago that she would no
longer be able to play the sport that
she loved so much. Howard made
it quite clear, however, that she was
faced with this for a good reason.
“I have come to realize that

this has happened to me for a rea-
son,” Howard said. “I believe God
has plarmed something else for me,
so I have to be patient and keep
fai .” _

Howard entered the -Pitt with a
full athletic ‘scholarship. She started
her freshman year and played
through her junior year. Howard
was the team’s leading scorer, shot-

Thompson has the usual again this season

—— defense. It’s just too bad he really does— '

n’t have any offensive threats.

Shemard Long showed signs of
becoming an offensive menace last year
when he averaged 25 points a game over
the last seven games of the 1998 campaign.
Thompson will also look to Trez Kilpatrick
to improve on the Hoyas’ -beleaguered
rebounding, but Kilpatrick will have to
improve on his shot selection at the same
time.’ -

Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje will share
time at the center position with Iameel
Watkins, and both must prove to _be than

just space-ﬁllers.

10. West Virginia —— The Mountaineers

lost six of their top seven players during the
off—season. So don’t look for WVU to
repeat the season it had last year. A trip to
the Sweet 16 is out of the question. Even a
trip to the NCAA Tournament is out of the
question. '

Marcus Goree is the only returning
player with valuable experience, and he
averaged only eight points a game last year.
Head coach Gale Catlett will look to junior-
college transfer Calvin Bowman to lessen
the load on Goree up front.

11. Seton Hall — Head coach Tommy
Amaker should be able to suit up for the
Pirates this year. They didn’t have much last
year, and they have even less this season.
They relied on their point guard, Shaheen

Holloway, to lead the team in scoring last
year as a freshman. Holloway is the team
leader, but he is still only a sophomore, and
Amaker hopes to have others pitch 

12. Boston College — Chestnut Hill won’t
be the prettiest place this year when it
comes to basketball. The Eagles retunr only
one of their ﬁve top scorers from last year’s
thin team, and they will not improve on the
15-16 season they had last year.

Second-year head coach Al Skinner
will rely on Kenny Harley in the backcourt
and Jonathan Beerbohm in the frontcourt.
Dwayne Pina will take over the reins at
point guard. After that, your guess is as
good as Skinner’s.

lost Pat Ganity. What in the world are they
going to do now?

Good question. ND was supposed to
improve a troubled basketball program
after moving to the Big East, but that hasn’t
been the case. Head coach John MacLeod
does have a talented center in Phil Hickey
and a ﬁne shooting guard in Antoni Wyche
to lead the Irish into a not—so—prornising sea-
son.

Leviticus Williamson and Hans
Rasmussen will make up the remaining
ﬁont line. Martin Ingelsby will take the
point after limited time in his freshman
year.

The remaining roster includes no one
who averaged more than two points per
game. Not a good sign for ND. There won’t
be any Irish eyes a—srnilin’ this year.

INJURIES

blocker and rebounder her sophomore and
junior seasons. She also scored her 10()0tlr
point on Feb. 1, 1997, which made her the
ninth woman in Pitt history to do this.

Howard had open-heart surgery in
November of last year, and doctors believe
that it was the surgery that caused the stroke.

The surgery was necessary because she
hadabacterialinfectionthatspreadtothe
mitral valve of her heart. This is one of the
valves that lets blood in and out of the heart.

Howard started this season with early-
morning conditioning, and at 5 am. Sept. 29,
the stroke hither. .

She recalls losing her balance and
falling over. Her roommate had already leﬁ
for practice, and when Howard didn’t show
up, her trainer knew something was wrong.
They found her lying on the ﬂoor of her

_ room and called an ambulance immediately.

If Howard had not been up so early that
morning, her condition could have been a
great deal worse. Because her roommate

, expected her at practice and found her quick-

ly, she received prompt medical treatment.
She is now on medication that prohibits her
from playing basketball or any other sport.

Her medication is a blood thinner used
to stop blood clotting, which caused her
stroke. Ifdoctors took her off the medication,
another stroke could occur.’ The doctors are
still unsure of what caused the blood clot, but
they do have a few ﬂreories.

Doctors believe that after her ﬁrst
surgery, a ﬂap of skin may have been left in
her valve, which could have caused a blood
clot that moved to her brain and caused her
stroke.

Because of her condition, Howard
doesn’t believe playing basketball is in her
future.

“I hope they ﬁnd the true cause of my
stroke, but even if they do, I-have to accept
the fact that I will never play basketball
again,” Howard said

Despite the hardships that Howard has
faced, she has recovered well from both the
surgery and the stroke. Though the stroke
left her right side paralyzed, she now has full
use of all of her body. Howard would like to
coach one day, but for now, she’s going to
takeitone dayatatime.

THE Prrr NEws

Hawkins improves
in third season  

Mario Machi

Staff Writer

“Isaac Hawkins can dominate a game
with his athleticism.” ‘

Those were the words of Pitt men’s bas-
ketball head coach Ralph  He was
speaking after Hawkins and Attila Cosby
took over the game in the second halfto lead
the Panthers to an 84-56 win over the
University of Maryland-Baltimore County

Friday night

Hawkins established himself as one of
the Big East’s top ﬁontcourt players in his
sophomore campaign. He averaged 14.2
points and 9.2 rebounds while playing an
astounding 37.2 minutes per game —
almost unheard of for a player at his position.

When asked about how he improved
over the summer, Hawkins remarked, “I’ve
gotten better mentally. I’m more of a vocal

~ leader out there. My shot has improved, and. I

I am dribbling better.”

COLUMN

Last year, Cummings was the
entire team. This year, he has a better
supporting cast.

Kellii Taylor will be healthy, and
Jarrett Lockhart will have more experi-
ence, giving the Panthers one of the
best backcourts in thegBig East.

Isaac Hawkins emerged as a solid
forward last year, and with Attila Cosby
and Ricardo Greer having more experi-
ence, the whole team should be better.

Good basketball is very exciting.

FROM PAGE 8

Yes, Fitzgerald Field House is old

and outdated, but few places rock so
much when Pitt’s playing well. There
isn’t a bad seat in the whole arena. No
matter where you sit, you’re right on
top of the action.

And its small size makes it loud as
hell, especially when Pitt is playing
well against a national powerhouse.

I can’t wait for the new convoca-
tion center. It reallyshould elevate the
basketball program to top-notch status.

But until then — at least for this year -

—— good old Fitzgerald Field House will

‘ do just ﬁne.

If Vonteego and his boys stay
healthy and play up to their full poten-
tial, Pitt will be an exciting place to be
come March.

Brian Knavish is a 5-7 columnist for
The Pitt News and can ’t play basketball
for shit.

Willard concurred, saying that Hawkins
“has improved his range.” Willard also said
he has “been impressed with the irnprove—
ment in Isaac’s footwork He’s really worked
hard on that.” _

Hawkins saidthathe stillhasalotto
improve on for the coming season. “You can
always improve your game. Until I only
have one or two things to improve on, I’ve
just got to keep working hard to be very suc-
cessful.”

Willard said that Isaac must improve his
inside game in order for the Panthers to

must quickly adjust to the game of college
basketball and the elfect it has on a person’s

mentality.

“You have to keep in focus. T‘hat’s what
I keep telling these" guys. These guys are just
like I was when I ﬁrst came here. They are
nervous. They just need to do what the coach
says, and they will be ﬁne.” , .

After that, it was only a matter of
time before the Panthers walked off the
court with their second victory in as
many games. Near the end of the game,
the fans saved their loudest ovation for
freshman Chris Seabrooks, who
entered with 4: 19 remaining in the con-
test. .

Willard said, “I was going to play
Seabrooks more, but he has a slight
breathing problem right now.”
According to Willard, there was no
time to run signiﬁcant testing because

Seabrooks made an impression, com-
ing up with a big steal and _shoving a
Red Flash player with one hand to clear
the paint for himself. Seabrooks picked
up his first collegiate foul on the play.

Fellow freshman Fred Primus also
opened some eyes, scoring 10 points in
just nine minutes. He was the ﬁfth
Panther player to reach double ﬁgures
and added one of the team’s 17 steals.
St.Francis had 28 turnovers in the
game. I

The limelight, however, belonged
to Cummings. After breaking his hand
in practice three weeks ago, he missed
just two exhibition games and Friday’_s
season opener. V

“Vee is Vee,” said Lockhart of
Cummings. “He brings a lot to the
team. Pass it, shoot it, he makes us all
look better. We’re happy tokhave him

back.”

Lockhart is not the only one. The
fans are happy to have him back, too.
And you can add Willard to that list.

“I left it up to him on how much he
wanted to play,” Willard said.

Cummings replied, “I expected to
come off the bench, so I was a little

surprised. But I played 40 minutes a

game last year. I’m not used to it.”
Cummings played just 30 minutes
in Tuesday’s game. Teammate Attila
Cosby’s hand is still a bit tender after a
slight fracture in the UMBC game on
Friday. The Panthers will get good
news when sophomore forward

Stephen Flores returns to practice.

tomorrow.
The Panthers play their first road

game of the season Friday against
