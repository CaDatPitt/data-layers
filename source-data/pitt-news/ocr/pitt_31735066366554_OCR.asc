Sorensen

Speaks

A t L   t 8 ° 0
Theodore C. So_renson, Special Counsel to President Ken-
nedy and author of Kennedy and Decision--Making, 1n the

White House, will be the ﬁrst speaker in the Student Union
Board's new Public Affairs Series Wednesday noon in -the

Student Union Ballroom.

As Kennedy’s Special Counsel,
Sorensen was the late President's
major writer of speeches, brain-
truster,~conﬁdant, and one of his
chief legislative aides. He was
considered one of the most in-
ﬂuential and important men in
Washington. .

Sorensen was in a position to

evaluate Kennedy’s relation with‘ '

his Cabinet and other appointees
as well as the role of the White
House staff. He saw ﬁrst-hand

. Kennedy’s actions in" the Cuban
‘missile crises, his anger at the

increase in steel prices and the
evolution of ‘his beliefs on civil
rights and arms control. He join-
ed ’ in shaping major decisions
and" was close to the President
duringand after the’ Bay of Pigs
episode.

During Kennedy’s entire pol-/’

itical career, Sorenson-was a ma-
jor aide. He was with him during
the key crises and turning points,
including the race for the vice-

presidency at the 1965 conven-
tion, the launching of Kennedy’s
Presidential candidacy, the speech
to the Protestant clergy of Hous-
ton, the TV> debates with Nixon
and election night at Hyannis
Port.-

‘Born in Lincoln, Neb., in 1928,
Sorenson attended the Universi-
ty of Nebraska and graduated,
Phi_Beta Kappa, in 1949. He re-
ceived his law degree from that
university in 1951.

After graduation he went to
Washington where he became an
attorney for the Federal Security
Agency, later the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare.

His work in Washington impress-I

ed Senator Paul Douglas to such

‘ an extent that he recommefded

him for a job as administrative
assistant to the newly elected
Senator Kennedy in 1953.

A Coffee Hour‘ with Sorenson

will be held at 3 p.m. in the Low-

» er Lounge.

“Most of the money is being

second-term SG senator's decision
was based on “my ﬁrm convic-
tion that SG cannot survive a
repetition of last year’s debacle.”

William Lerach, also -an SG
senator, will be Engels’ running
mate on an independent ticket.
Engels replied, “A major reason
for the stagnation of SG was the

laziness of the party system fos- .

tered. Like sheep, people would
follow their party leaders ‘and do
no. thinking on their own. We
realize.it maybe more difficult
to win without _a party but if. SG
is ever going to mean anything
at Pitt, the. people envolved must

be prepared” to cooperate and

think fo_r themselves.”

Engels,‘ a junior political ‘sci- ‘

ence major with a 3.-3 QPA, has
served as chairman ‘of the book
exchange, the identiﬁcaton card
committee, and authored the
proﬁt-sharing plan for _the Book

SURE Camlidate
A‘ new campus ‘Group, Stu-
dents United for Responsible Ex-
pression (SURE) has announced
Ralph Manning and Howard Ain-p
isman as their candidates for the
top Student Government l(SG)‘
posts. SURE announced they will
endorse a full slate of SG sena-
torial candidates shortly.
Manning, the presidential can-
didate, opened his campaign by
saying, . “N either my.‘-present state-
ment nor_ my forthcoming cam-
paign platform will be based up-
on vague generalization or false
promises. I am running for presi-
dent for the speciﬁc purpose of
improving the present image of
SG. The’SURE is most emphati-
cally not a party, »but rather it
is a group of students who band-
ed’ together for the purpose of
creating a responsible govern-
ment deserving of everyone’s re-
spect.” ' i 
He continued, “We are dedi-
cated, ﬁrst and foremost, to put-
ting the wishes of students into
action rather than just talking
about them. —
“Neither the students nor SG
can afford another election simi- ‘
lar to last year’s, in which the
voters were not aware of what
the candidates represented until
the candidates had taken office.
When they cast their ballots this
year, I feel the voters deserve to
be infolgned of what the candi-
dates stand for. with this thought
in mind, our campaign will be
dedicated to a. clear deﬁnition of
what SURE represents. I hope
that the voters will demand this‘
clarity from all the candidates."

Will‘ Daka and the League of
the New Order overthrow the
Government? Will Uncle Martin
be thrown to Daka’s pet alliga-
tors, Nojo-Nojo and Saquo-Saquo?
‘Will Bruce Wayne and Dick Gray-
son (better known as Batman
and Robin) maintain possession
of the Radium Gun, or will they
fall victims to Hirohito’s hire-
lings? And——most important of
all-—-are Batman and Robin se-
cretly engaged?

Forget, for a while, the war in
Vietnam. Put the War on Pov-

5 the subway strike. Drop that
comic" book now, and hustle over
to the Strand to spend An’ Eve-
ning with Batman and Robin, an
artless but totally amusing mara-
. than on ineptitude and nostalgia.
The movie is actually‘ the en-
tire set of 15 Batman episodes,
-ﬁlmed in 1943 to be released in
serial form. But in the atomic
» age, when on a moment's notice
we all might be spent reeling to-
wards the Bat Cave, the public
cannot run the risk of waiting
one whole week to ﬁnd out
whether or not Robin gets maim-
A ed inside the Sunkist orange
juice maker. We might never
' ﬁnd out. Hence, the 248-minute
evening with the “dynamic duo.”
, The byword of this ﬁlm is not
subtlety, much to the delight of
"the predominantly college-aged
audiences. Linda Page, for ex-
_ ample, the girl who vies with
Robin for Batman’s attention,
. personiﬁes the naive tempera-
ment of a comic book character
brought to life.
, In the middle of a frantic car
I. chase, in which her uncle is be-
ing kidnapped by a» handful of
" Daka’s best strongmen, Miss Page
reaches a moment”of pure in-
sight: “I have the strange feel-
ing that Uncle Martin is in trou-
, ble.” '
There are other moments of
ecstasy for devotees of Camp-
the cult that worships comic book
heroes, deiﬁes obscure television
stars and recording artists, and
. uses as its icon the 1961 team
*_ picture of the New York Titans
.— ‘football team.
‘L Dr. Drake himself, who sounds
 and looks like Liberace with lip-
-stick, ﬁnds himself face—to-face
1 with a dissenting Uncle Martin.
._Daka promptly frightens him
— with the immortal line, spoken
.» in pseudo-Japanese: “I . . . sug-
gest...you...adopt...an
" . . . of . . . fatalistic . .
resignation.” Bonzai!
But back to the heroes. In
 speech and opinion, they, too, do
5 more than enough to accentuate
..{_their inability to be real people.
5 Or put more plainly, they are
7 too real. Robin and Batman (or,
-I for the sake of journalistic truth,
. Fatman) are poorer ﬁghters than
the Campers in the audience. In
theﬁrst episode alone, the cos-
. tumed duo runs away from so
much action that they resemble
two Sonny Listons with a Hallo-
- ween complex.
When forced to ﬁght, the team’s
- garments actually hinder them.
Batman’s cape gets in the way,
-while his Bat Hat often covers
his eyes. Robin is simply too
light to cope with the weight of
‘  costume, or, for that matter,
i: with the enemy. And after be.
‘ing iknocked Batty in his ﬁrst
ﬁght scene, an exhilarated Robin
. endears himself to those Strand-
“ed_in«'the audience when he ex-
‘ claims to his partner: “Sure some
‘iﬁght, wasn't it!” -

 Such ’ an improbable relation-

the ﬁlm. Batman (played by Lew-

Croft) live in womanless bliss in
a large mansion with their chauf-

(Batman) himself puts it, when
a jealqus Linda Page asks why
he even associates with Robin:
“He isn't much to look at, but
he's a good friend.”

The movie itself isn't much to
look at, but it's funny. Its length
even points up the inherent beau-
ty of television: you can turn it
off. And the references to World
War II, the broad-brimmed hats
and double-breasted suits are
humorous to the large numbers
of War Babies seated in the au-

such clothing and oddities, so

_ROMAN IN THE GLOAMIN’

Now as the end of the ﬁrst semester draws near, one fact
emerges clearly: you are all going to ﬂunk out of school.

There are two things you can do about it. First, you can
marry money. (I don't mean you marry the money itself; I
mean you marry a person who has money. Weddings be-

tween people and currency have not been legal anywhere in -

the United States since the Smoot—Hawley Act. Personna®
Stainless Steel Blades, on the other hand, are legal every-
where and are, indeed, used with great pleasure and satis-

» faction in all ﬁfty states of the Union and Duluth. I bring
- up Personna Stainless Steel Blades because this column is

. sponsored by the makers of Personna Stainless Steel Blades,
and they are inclined to get edgy if I omit to mention their
product. Some of them get edgy and some get double-edgy
because Personna Blades come both in Injector style and
Double Edge style.)

But I digress. I was saying you can marry money but, of

course, you will not because you are a high-minded, clean- A

living, pure’-hearted, freckle-faced American kid. Therefore,
to keep from ﬂunking, you must try the second method:
you must learn how to take lecture notes. 0
According to a recent survey, eleven out of ten American
undergraduates do not know the proper way to-take lecture
notes. To illustrate this appalling statistic,’ let us suppose
you are taking a course in history. Let us further suppose
the lecturer is lecturing on the ruling houses of England.
You listen intently. You write diligently in your notebook,
making a topic outline as you have beentaught. Like this:
I. House of Plantagenet.
II. ouse of Lancaster.
III. House of York. -

  

Then you stop. You put asidevyour pen. You blink back
a tear, for you cannot go on. Oh, yes, you know very well
that the next ruling house 18 the House of Tudor. The trou-

V 2% is you don't know the Roman numeral that comes after

It may, incidentally, be of some comfort to learn that
you are not the only people who don't know Roman numer-
als. The fact is, the Romans never knew them either. Oh, I

suppose they could tell you how much V or X were or like ‘

that, but when itcameto real zingers like LXI or MMC,
they just ﬂang away their styluses and went downtown to
have a bath or takein a circus -or maybe stab Caesar a few
times. - '

You may wonder why Rome stuck with these ridiculous
numerals when the Arabs had such a nice, simple system.’
Well, sir, the fact is that Emperor Vespasian tried like crazy
to buy the Arabic numerals from Suleiman The Magniﬁcent,
but Suleiman wouldn’t do business—not even when Vespa-
sian raised his bid to 100,000 gold piastres, plus he offered
to throw in the Colosseum, the Appian Way, and Techni-
color.

So Rome stuck with’ Roman numerals-—to its siorrow, as
it turned out. One day in the Forum, Cicero and Pliny got
to arguing about how much is CDL/times’ MVIX. Well, sir,
pretty soon everyone in town came around to join the has-
sle. In all the excitement, nobody remembered to lock the
north gate and—wham! before you could say ars longa—in
rushed the Goths, the Visi‘goths,"and the Green Bay Packers!

Well, sir, that's the way the empire crumbles, and I di-
gress. Let’s get back to lecture notes. Let’s also say a word
about Burma Shave’-=9. Why? Because Burma Shave is made
by the makers of Rersonna Blades who, it will be recalled,
are the sponsors of this column. They are also the sponsors
of theultimate inshaving luxury. First coat your kisser
with Burma Shave, regular or menthol—or, if you are the
devil-may-care sort, some of each. Then whisk off your stub-

. ble with an incredibly sharp, unbelievably durable Personna

Blade, Injector or Double Edge—remembering ﬁrst to put
the blade in ,a razor. The result: facial felicity, cutaneous
cheer, epidermal elysium. Whether you shave every day,
every III days, or every VII, you’ll always ﬁnd Personna

Ross Scores CIA’s it
Independent Actions

By BERN! McLEOD
Speaker Thomas Ross blamed the Cen-

tral Intelligence Agency for the United States being low in
the eyes of the world. The author of The Invisible Govern-
ment says “The credibility of statements of the United
States is low. Friend and foe alike suspect us.”

International incidents and
cloak and dagger tactics of the

uation. Ross has found that the
CIA, which he calls “the invisi-
ble government,” has carried on
many activities which the United
States Government will not admit.

Prior to the U-2 incident, in-
volving surveillance ﬂights over
Russia, few Americans were
aware that they occured. Before

the’ Cuban Bay of Pigs, Ameri-

cans may, have also felt only
belligerents would interfere in
the internal domestic affairs_ of
another country. “Now they are
more sophisticated,” said Ross.
Citing a. letter to the mother
of a U.S. pilot killed at“the Bay
of Pigs. he noted that the gov-
ernment and CIA denied having
any knowledge of the disappear-
ance of her son. “In reality,” said
Ross, “he was ﬂying over Cuba
on the-payroll of the CIA.”
Other similar incidents in Bur-
ma, Laos, Guatemala, Indonesia,
Costa Rica and Iran have created

H ‘distrust toward America. In In-

‘ donesia, as Ross explained, Pres-
ident Sukarno has reason to hate
us. United States pilots, planes

When the Central Intelligence

was not authorized to carry on
such secret activities. However,
as Ross explained, a loose inter-

allowed it to over-step its bounds.

By Tom Cikoski

Coach Nail, in an inter-
view after the Wilcox-Parsi-
fal match, reviewed the fac-
tors responsible for the
team's bad performance.

“Poor coaching,” he said,
“is our biggest problem. 1’m
probably the worst Hide-and-
Seek coach in the country.
The only reason they keep
me here is ’cause they can’t
_g__e1_:_ nobody else.”

“He’s right.,”-Harry Groob
said, popping his head out of
a crack in the woodwork.

“We hate the bastard,”
chimed Fred Tipik from the
showers.

WE’VE GOT all the mon-
ey we can handle,” the coach
continued. “Charter a jet for
all away meets, give full tui-
tion. and expenses to all our
boys, and recruit all the top
high school talent in 13
states. There was enough
dough left over last year to
buy myself a Buick.”

“Our schedule is carefully
planned to match us with all
the small second-rate teams
in the country,” he went on,
“and still we can’t win. It's
nobody’s fault but my own.
1’m a bum.” -

But even while holding the '

typically pessimistic attitude
of a coach, Nail was looking
hopefully toward the future.
_ “If we can keep our in-
J1_n‘_ies down and stay in con-
dition we've got a good
chance for a berth in the Na-
tionals,” he said. “But .I’ll
probably blow it.”

Next Chancellor of the University--

NOW WAIT A MINUTE!

Up until a few weeks ago the above
might have been the typical reaction to the

. last question asked about Governor Scran-

ton’s career. But, statments from State Sen-
ator Albert’ Pechan‘ and non-committals re-

  .. ., ., .. plies from the Gover-
nor about his future
indicate that Chancel-
lor Scranton is a pos-
sibility. So now since
it becomes more of a
possibility, just how
would Scranton ﬁll the
shoes?

~»>..M<i~v

  

imagine " Dr. Perkins
._ would reply. The Pres-
ident of Cornell University, Dr. Perkins is
the man who has more than once asked
“with faculty in orbit, students out looking
for their lost identity, and administrators

iut setting off. dynamite under‘. foundation

vaults . . (Who is in charge?” He is consid-
ered one of the nation’s outstanding theori-
ticians on the role of the large university.

In Dr. Perkin’s mind the burden of lead-
ership rests squarely on the university pres-
ident. He sees the faculty as being freed

from administrative duties as much as pos-

sible, so that it can do its job of research
and teaching.
Governor Scranton is a man with wide

administrative experience. With the excep-
;ion of the state insurance commission, the

“agencies of his administration have been

effectively run andfree from public criti-
cism. He has brought young, vigorous men

like Secretaryof Commerce John Tabor and.-

Secretary of Welfare Arlin Adams into his

"administration. But ‘Dr. Perkins _—feels the ,
University presidentgis someone whotmust -;

::t.he=.. ‘li’ fac. 1-

‘‘Rather well,’’ It“

 

which it is occupied.” Dr. Perkins urges
that this job “cannot be divided among dis-
parate elements‘ of the university.”

_ To fill this aspect ‘of-the role of Chan-
cellor, few could ask for anyone better than

‘Scranton. He would enter the position as

the untarnished former governor of one of
the nation’s largest states. His name would
engen/der great respect and could contribute
much to, pep up the “public face’_’ Dr. Per-
kins calls for.

Moreover, while he is an educated man,
the intricacies of curriculum and academic
structure could be delegated to other re-
sponsible educators Scranton would appoint.
Scranton could then be left with more time
to deal with the nebulous but all important
responsibility ‘of being concerned with the
“university as a whole.” Few would argue
that several important members of the
Pittsburgh community are not as close to
the University as they once were. A man

' like Scranton, close to many -of these inﬂu-
" ential citizens, could bring them back into ‘
the fold, once more. \ -

But Bill Scranton is at a crossroads. Un-

-3

der'the Constitution of the Commonwealth -

he can not succeed himself as‘Governor. If
he does indeed look to the White-"House, he
must somehow keep in the public eye until
'68., Though there was some talk that Sena-
tor Hugh Scott would run for Governor and
then appoint Scranton to fill out his term
in the United States Senate, the Republi-

cans seem to have decided against this rig- 

amarole. Lt. Governor Raymond Shafer has .

received the backing of party leaders for
the gubernatorial nomination and Hugh
Scott was never seriously considered. ‘Serv-
ing as Chancellor might well be the answer
to the present problems in Scranton’s ca-

reer. . '

aturday night’s 100-78 loss to
Virginia Tech. VPI’s 6-10 junior
 King dominated" both on of-
ense and on defense.

,; According to coach" Bob Tim-
mons, Tech just had too much
manpower and too much height
or the Panthers to cope with.
-‘King made his presence felt un-
derneath those boards,” said
Timmons. “We had Jim LaVal-
*ey on him for most of the night
ut King killed us with the tap-
ins.

'“"‘“When we met VPI last year,
King was inexperienced ‘and we
were able to beat them. But this
car they're a much improved
ballclub all-around.” 7

1 Even when Tech took King
‘out, their “small” team played
ast, aggressive ball. “We fell be-
hind after the 15 minute point
of the ﬁrst half,” Timmons ex-
‘plained. “Then when we had to
M press, their shorter boys took ad-
"vantage of the situation and piled
up the points.

_ “We' probably could have held
he “score down,” Timmons add-
_, “but we never would have
had any chance to catch up. The
press is a gamble. When it works,
you're in business. This time it
dn’t.”

~ The hoopsters managed 27 re-
ounds to vrrs 47. Only a dead-
 eye'," shooting club can compen-
I ate for that difference and ex-
_ect a victory. Since the Pan-
thers are not Providence (biggest

, By JAY ROSENSTEIN

the Panthers some ballgames. That was bad enough. ‘But
when a team can't rebound effectively, that's worse. A
team that doesn’t have the ball to begin with, hasn’t a

The hoopsters were beaten badly on both boards in

’Rebounder King wound up the
night with 20 points, the same
total as.Panther backcourt man
Stan Falenski. Falenski didn’t
start the game because of a poor
showing against Georgia Tech.
But Timmons inserted him into
the lineup and was impressed.

Despite LaValley’s inability to
contain Mr. King, the Panther
coach was fairly pleased with
his. play. “Jim got us 11 or 12
points and did the best he could
against a man four inches taller.”

Bob Lovett’s rebounding. how-
ever, disappointed Timmons. The
6-5 forward had to be replaced
by Roth McNally, a 6-1 guard.
“McNally has come along in the
past few weeks, so I put him in
there when Lovet was havingt
his problems with Ted Ware,
their 6-5 fordward.

Ware, a highly regarded spoho-
more, played a good game ac-
cording to Timmons. “They have
a lot of ﬁne basketball players at
VPI,” he said. “Ware is one of
them. He averages his 15 points
a game and gets his rebounds.
They consider him the best re-

‘bounder on their varsity.”

It’s obvious that a team that
has a 6-10 center who is not the
club's leading rebounder is a
powerful ballclub. VPI, now 10-
2, is certainly that as the Pan-
thers will attest.

‘ The hoopsters now have play-
ed ten games and have won three.
They have beaten Carnegie Tech,
George Washington, and Ro-
chester, The big concern is that
the tougher part of the season
apparently lies ahead.

They must face Penn State and
West Virginia twice, plus Eastern
basketball powers St. John's,
Fordham, Temple, and Syracuse
once each.

Most observers had felt at. the‘

beginning of the season that ‘the
Panthers would playaround .500
ball for the year. Lack of height
was known to be a problem but
not to the extent that it has
proven to be.

There are some good shooters on
the ballclub, however, and all is
not glum. Larry Szykowny hasn’t
yet hit with the accuracy from
the ﬂoor that he showed he was
capable of last year. The same
can be said about Lovett. Once

last ﬁve sec-

By TOM SACKS-
Asststantbports ndttor .
The wrestling teaIn’s fortunes went out
with the low tide last year and they are

coming back in the same way this season.

The matmen in their ﬁrst meet of the
season were upended 22-13 Saturday by
Temple, which is by far not. one of the
wrestling powerhouses in_ the East.

One of'the few bright spots‘ in the open-
ing meet was the performance of the wrest-
lers in the upper weight divisions. Jack
Williams’ pin ‘in the 191 class and Terry
Hoover’s heavyweight victory have nearly
equaled the total output last year in those
two areas.

Both Hoover and Williams are sopho-
mores and their performance was a big con-
solation to coach Dave Johnson. Johnson,
who won the Eastern title in his weight
class thr'ee straight times during his under-A
graduate years here, was given the assign-
ment of rebuilding the. wrestling program
this year. - s

For the past 16.years the coach had been
Rex Peery, who literally ‘created wrestling
at this school. Under Peery the matmen
built a name for themselves as one of the
powers in the East. Then recruiting and
academic problems struck the wrestlers sev-
eral years ago and Peery decided to resign
last year.

Saturday’s disappointing defeat wasn't
enough to disappoint Johnson. “I sort of
knew what I was getting into- when I took
the job,” said Johnson. “I can remember
some great teams from Pitt and I know_it

will take several years before I can build
another.” _ '

From the ‘angle of experience if every-
thing goes all right academically Johnson
should be in pretty good shape “two years
from‘ now. Seven out of the 10 starters in
the Temple meet were sophomores.

\

.‘fWe have a pretty fair team right now,”’

said Johnson. “It’s just that they are so
inexperienced.”

Dino Boni, one of the few veterans, also‘

provided one of the few. wins Saturday.

Boni at 145 won the Eastern title last year

in the E.I.W.A. tournament. 7 A
The two matches that cost the matmen

I a victory occurred in the 130 and 160 pound

weight divisions. At 160 Clair Riley was
wining up until the last five seconds of the
match when he suffered a takedown.

More disturbing than Riley’s defeat was
that of Bob Schugart, who lost by default.
Schugart was attempting to bring down his
opponent who kept jumping up. Finally
Schugart picked him up and dropped him.
on his head. The referee disqualified him
since his opponent was unable to continue. A

“The rulebook reads that if Schugart
was on one knee before his opponent hits
ground he is not at fault. I thought his
knee was down,” said Johnson. “.It’s a hard
call for any referee to make.”

In several weeks Rich Shildt ‘should also
add strength to the mat line-uep. As a fresh-
man last year he wrestled at 123, but he
broke his hand lastmonth and had to wres-
tle at 137 Saturday. With a few more weeks
of workouts he should ‘be down to his right
weight.

Medley Relay Team Sets Record  

But, Swimmers Succumb,

BY GEORGE LIES

69-26

I The third time wasn't a charm for the swimming team as they dropped a 69-26 de-"'
cision to a highly talented Maryland University team at Trees Pool last Saturday.

For the swimmers, it was a matter of not being in condition after the holiday lay-
off despite a spirited showing. For Maryland, it was a matter of entering their All-
American swimmers in the events and waiting until their hosts’ backs. broke. _

Everything went Maryland’s way except for the first event of the meet. It was

the 400-yard medley relay; one

of two bright spots for coach
Ben Grady"s team. As for Mary-
land, _it was a shocker.

Joe Leviere, Jack Volz, Gary
Martin, and John Lane comprised
the relay team. Together they
set a new pool and varsity rec-
ord, swimming the distance in a
time of 3:44.9. The new record
lowered the old pool time, iron-
ically held by Mary1and,,by about
six seconds. I

“They could beat the for-
mer team by a good eight or
nine seconds,” he said. “If they
are selected for the Easterns this
year, the team could easily ﬁn-
ish third or fourth, but it de-
pends on what other teams are

Don Hahnfeldt, the ‘other co-
captain, provided the second first
place for the tankmen; it came
in the diving competition. This '
kept the score slightly close at

Opportunity comes early at Ford Motor Company.
Graduates who join us are often surprised at how
quickly they receive personal assignments involv-I
 ing major responsibilities. This chance to dem-
onstrate individual skills contrasts sharply with
the experience of many young people entering the
business world for the first time. At Ford Motor
Company, for example, a graduate may initiate a
project and carry it through to its final develop-
ment. One who knows is David Tenniswood, of
our research ‘staff. ' A

 

David Tenniswood

B.S., Michigan State Univ.
M.S., Michigan State Univ.

Dave joined Ford Motor Company in July, 1961.
Assigned to our steering and controls section, he helped develop a revolu-
tionary steering system that will facilitate driving in future For-d.bui1t cars,
Currently a design engineer working on suspension design and analysis,
Dave has been impressed by theextent to which management encourages
personal initiative among recent graduates like himself. Here, management
looks immediately to young engineers, like Dave,’ for fresh concepts-that
reﬂect their academic training and special abilities. Moreover, when the
idea is accepted for development, the initiator is frequently given the
opportunity to see the - job through—from drawing board to production line!

The experience of Dave Tenniswood is not unusual. Ford Motor Company I '
believes that early incentive is fundamental to individual growth and a
successful career. If you are interested in a job that challenges your abilities
and rewards enterprise, we urge youto contact our representative -when
he visits your campus. , ' ‘
