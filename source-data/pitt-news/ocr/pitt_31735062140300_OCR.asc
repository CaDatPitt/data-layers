Spirited Meeting Last Wednesday
Morning Suggests Many Ways
For lmprovement of Chapel
Service

FACULTY IS CRITICIZED

Variety of Opinions Indicates Chapel
Attendance is Variously Inter-
preted in the Institution

A mass meeting was called last
VVednesday in the Assembly room in
Thaw Hall for the purpose of discuss-
ing means to improve the ‘attendance
at chapel. The announcement on the

‘bulletin boards read for both the Fac-
ulty and students, but neither re-

-sponded in any degree of enthusiasm.
The teaching force was represented
by a number too small to mention
and the students were corresponding-
ly assembled.

President iArcher, of the -student

_sen’ate stated the opinions of that

body regarding the lack of interest
displayed by the students during the
last few weeks. The speaker made
several suggestions in regard to im-
proving the services, chief among

' which, were the making of student an-A

nouncements from the seats of the
undergraduates and frequent address-
es of the faculty members. Chancel-
lor McCormick was the next speaker,
and in a forceful way the necessity
and value of devotional ‘exercises were
shown. Professor Gibbs made a few
remarks in behalf of the‘ faculty and
largely reiterated the statements of
Doctor McCormick.

An invitation was given the stu-
dents to express their opinions and
Eades '11, ‘Stewart ’12, Kirk ’13 and
Allison '14 responded. A mild sur-
prise was occasioned by _the state-
ment_ of one of the speakers that the
faculty members were largely ‘respon-
sible for the lack of interest in the
Whereupon a live-
ly discussion ensued by several fac-
ulty members and the student advo-
cating the co-operation of the
structors.

No speciﬁc action was taken by the
joint meeting, but it is expected to
reach a. deﬁnite conclusion at the post-
1oned session this morning.

Civic Body Will Co-operate In Making

At a meting of the Chamber of
Commerce last week the report of the
education committee was presented
and a resolution adopted endorsing
the ” plan for the celebration“ of the
one hundred ‘and twenty-ﬁfth anniver-
sary ofithe founding of the ‘university,
which will be, held next February 28.
The report ‘emphasized the importance
of the plan to secure a fund of $1,500,-
000 for additional -endowment and
buildings for the university and urged
the co-operation of the chamber in
joint action with Pittsburg’s civic and
commercial bodies toward making this
event a notable one in the city’s his-
tory. ‘ '

Chancellor McCormick addressed
the chamber in support of the move-
ment, saying that the university that
the university was now proceeding on
1a $3,000,000 basis, with only ‘a ‘$500,000
endowment, and that it would be'im-
possible to continue the work on its

arl funds were forthcoming.

Work is being pushed on the Indus-

Dr. Chambers
issues Appeal

Call Extended to Young Men of the
State to Heed the Teaching
‘ Profession

Dean Chambers, of the School of
Education, has decently distributed a
circular letter over the State of Penn-
sylvania, calling attention to the Won-
derful possibilities of teaching in the
secondary schools for young men.
The demand for trained men in this
particular branch of educational work
is said to be far inexcess ‘of the sup-
«ply.

The School of Education in the Uni-
versity of -Pittsburgh, offers ‘exactly
the training required for such -at pro-
fession. The appeal -of -Doctor Cham-
bers should reach into the heart of
every young man whose future career
is as yet undetermined.

After Several Months’ ‘De’-lay

A force of men started last week to
excavate for the thoroughfare which
will extend from Grant "Boulevard to
A-1.-lequ-ippa Street in the ‘University
‘Campus. The grading of the road is
expected to proceed rapidly through
the summer in order to permit com-

The roadway "is to be the ﬁrst step

us hope the task will be prosecuted

with haste.

The annual election for positions on

The "Value ofrcomposure before an

' audienceand an ability to express

thoughtsyclearly is primarily the ‘pur-

-pose of public -speaking, as taught in

the University, and“other institutions

_ .« . .‘of the country. . The instructor in pub-
' ,.li‘c ‘speaking very recentlyjannounced‘

«a course known ' as," C extemporaneous
speech. «The Value of such instruction
.to the student, no matter what his

 ..fut'ure vocation._may.be, can scarcely

be‘ reckoned in mere Words. Perhaps
the—'most signiﬁcant -thing about the
course "is its wongderful power to _ de-

. tvelop independent thought among. the
_ men and.wom_en on"the institution.

»The’i'e is a tendencyamong students

I‘ to'fol1o'w too closely the teachings ,of ’

the’ professors and instructors, but

3 such action is not favorable to self-

control or‘ self-_assertion’. ‘ The pro-

gramof the course _in extemporaneous,

speaking‘ isyso arranged that the ad-

: ‘dresses are made, everylresitation day

litical andT_f‘s‘ocial_ world. The instruct-

" I. or ‘retired completely ‘from ‘the charge

ofthe meeting, except to distribute

exercises; thus making -the gathering
purely, of student nature, and without
the strain of the'professor’s interrup-,

tion. "It is not the policy of the Week-

ly to laud or underrate any course of
the University curriculum, but this

‘particular opportunity to give favor-

able mention to such worthy instruc-
tion could‘ not be passed by unnoticed.
The ability to produce thoughts, which

THE PITTOWEEKLY

question. The strange part of the in-
numerable columnswritten about the
attribute of college life‘ is, that when
all is said and done no one is any

_ wiser concerning the real meaning of

the term. It is perfectly candid to ad-
mit, that college spirit is intangible;
it is indeﬁnable and must be experi-
enced to realize its existence’ in this
material world. There is in its pres-
ence the uncontrollable desire to burn
fences, to tear domn buildings and
make things ﬂy in general.
intoxication of the. care free youth,
which looks to higher education for
support. Fundamentally college spirit
is not college spirit—a paradox, to be

because the common appreciation does
not permit the things of_"the intellect
to be the background. \Enth,usiasm
for debates and-incessant study is

’ not generally considered the true ap-

plication. of. college spirit. Athletics,

" clubs, politics and fraternities seem

to be the main support of the nebulous‘
‘asset’ (Jfthe average college man. It
is,.not surprising, therefore,’ that col-
lege spirit‘-is a foible, a fad and a
whim, tolerated by an indulgent array
of.,college professors of the’ modern
time. But the ﬂimsyplground of edu-
cational support is ‘the means of pro-
ducing three w’orth'y‘ points of higher
education, which cannot be learned in
books or lectures and which form the
m.oulding inﬂuences of -future life,
namely, loyalty,‘ devotion and unity
of purpose. ‘The so-called college
spirit does instill these qualities into
the mind of a youth‘ in such a way that

learning that the future pillarsof the
,state and nation must meet the vital
«facts of life. -How are we going to
,train these boys and girls, who inn,
few years must ascend tlfe"rostri'iin of
every—day existence? It is imperative
that- the instruction be at ‘the best
possible character, or the purpose of '
public school education will be lost in
the labyrinth of incapability. This
does‘ not imply that the ever increas-

Oval

Captain Bryson

 

Under the tutelage of Captain Bry-

son and Coach Thompson, the track
candidates are faithfully training at

V the Oval. The annual relay games of

the University’ of Pennsylvania occur
one week. fromithis coming Saturday,
and it is going to be a herculean task
to have the runners in condition for
the meet. It is said “Tony” Ross,
last year’s captain and one of the best
university quarter mile men, will try
for the team this year. Captain Bry-
son Was loath to conﬁrm this report,
but, it is understood, the probabilities
of Ross’ return to the cinder path are

‘ extremely hopeful.

"Regarding the university’s chances
at Philadelphia Saturday after next,

' Captain Bryson had the following to

say: “It is true, the classiﬁcation has

been changed, but we beat all those

teams last spring. It pleases us, and
we ought to have no complaint in re-
gard to the class this year. I am not
at liberty to give the probable make-
up of the team, but you may say it
will be the best wevcan develop.”

COMPLETES NOTABLE WORK

Reverend George -P. Donehoo, D.D.,
an alumnus of the University, now a
resident of Condershort, Pa,
just completed his Handbook of Amer-
ican Indians, .Part 2. The work has
elicited praise from every quarter and
is a valuable addition to the country’s
literature. ~

The work will shortly be placed on
the shelves of the University library.
