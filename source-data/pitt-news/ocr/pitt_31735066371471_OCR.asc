Jackson rides his rainbow to Pitt   .

By Gabrielle Pease
The Pitt News

Democratic presidential candidate Rev.
Jesse Jackson spoke before an overﬂowing
crowd in the Assembly Room ofthe William
Pitt Union at noon yesterday, starting off
with the observation, “This university isjust
like this nation — it keeps underestimating
me. We should have had this meeting in the
stadium.” -

Hoping to garner the support of the young
college crowd, Jackson talked of building a

H “rainbow coalition” of young Americans.

“This campaign is not so much about pro-
jecting‘ a black president as it is about pro-
jecting the black experience, and that is one
of the downtrodded and the rejected...the
experience of those who have been denied

- equal protection of the law.”

He added that the poorest Americans are
not black males like himself. The civil rights
activist drew applause as he asserted that the
nation’s poor are mostly comprised of young
white females, many of them with children
but no husband.

Jackson criticized the Reagan Adminis-
tration for cutting off school lunch pro-

Jesse Jackson drew an overﬂow crowd to the Wm. Pitt ,Union_

  

 

‘There’s a certain mold that
most politicians fit into. I think
Jesse deals with politics from a
more realistic and humanistic

‘point of view. He deals with

health, education and welfare for
all people first.’
— Derrick K. Davis, senior

‘I was surprised. I’m a Republi-
can. I like hisideas on defense
spending and cutting it. I think he
talks maybe a little bit‘ too much
about religion in his campaign.
That’s the only thing that worries
me.’

‘I thought he was very positive.

They’re focusing "more on the

and not talking about getting
jobs for-everyone.’

grams and what he termed valuable Head
Start programsthat pull the young out ofthe
slums. “Don‘t punish geniusjust because its
poor." he shouted on two occasions.

He said undernourished children often
fall asleep in — later drop out of —- school,
thereby depriving the society of many of its
brightest minds. As a way of increasing the
impact of his argument, Jackson pointed out
that “the cure for cancer hasn’t come from
the suburbs.” .

After noting that many young and disad-

vantaged Americans resort to a life of crime '

after dropping out of school, Jackson com-
pared the cost of four years at Penn State to
a four-year sentence at the “state pen.” He
brcought the crowd to a state of cheering
agreement when he proclaimed, “Schools at
their worst are better thanjails at their best!”

About halfway through his presentation,
the candidate stopped speaking as two
separate groups of students from among the

throng waiting in the building’s lobby burst

noisily through the doors at the back of the
Assembly Room. When asked how she got
past the many security guards lining the
entrance, a young black woman, who

refused to reveal her name, said, “We just 3

pushed our way in here.”

Students work for candidates

By Kelly Murray
The Pitt News

Student involvement in the pri-
mary campaigns of the leading
Democratic candidates is intensify-
ing as Tuesday’s Pennsylvania pri-
mary approaches.

All three democratic contenders
_ Walter Mondale, Jesse Jackson
and Gary Hart —~ are represented by
student volunteers on the Pitt
campus.

Each has been organizing on-
campus activities in the hope of
attracting Pitt‘s eligible voters.

But even in a presidental election,
organizers are having difficulty find-
ing enough volunteers.

“lt’s a lot of work and ljust don’t ’
have the time to do it all myself,"
said Jeff Graham, campus coordina-
tor for the Hart campaign.

_Graham’s group currently has
approximately 35 student volun-
teers who have organized primary
parties in the ground floor of the
William Pitt Union and helped to

bring King to Pitt. Graham and his
assistants last night sponsored a
fund raiser at the Sanctuary Bar on
South Bouquet Street.

Graham said that his group is dif-
ferent from those supporting Mon-
dale, which have sufficient money
for training their volunteers.

“He [Mondale] doesn’t have peo-
ple like me who have never done this
before," Graham said. “1 would
really like a trained person to train

1 me on what 1 should be doing. That’s

what 1 think the main weakness in

‘the campaign is.”

Monda1e’s operation on the Pitt
campus is being run by a 1982 Pitt
graduate, Tom Cohen, who said he
is ~-working on a “partially-paid,
partially—volunteer" basis, but he
could not be specific on the number
of hours he actually spends organiz-
ing students and activities on cam-
pus. He is also responsible for
coordinatingthe 18th Congressional
District.

He was unable to estimate the
number of students actively
involved in the Mondale effort on
campus.

Two members of the Black Action
Society are coordinating the campus
Jesse Jackson campaign — Presi-
dent Darryl Davis and deputy chair-
person Gladys Brown. Davis,
however, said he did not support the
candidate in the beginning.

“When 1 first thought Jesse Jack-
son did not have the support of
black leaders, such as Julian Bond,

_then 1 could not support him.” Davis

said he wondered, “Is he just run-
ning because he 18 a black man?”

lt was not until after a “private
discussion" with Benjamin Hooks,
the National Director of the
NAACP, during BAS sponsored
“Black Week” that Davis said he
realized, “black leaders were trying
to figure where to direct the black
vote, not how to endorse a
candidate.

“Hart has got a lot of young peo-
ple behind him, and we are going to
try and counter that,” Davis said.
“We‘re going to try and show black
college students and female students
that Jesse is the candidate for them,
not because he isa black candidate,
but because he is for students.”

M ' t '  

This election year, the Democratic party has presented the
American people with an wide range of ideological differences.
It has been a long time since a diversity of ideas this large has

appeared in American politics, as it has during this election
year. It should serve as notice that there is something brewing
in the Democratic party and the entire American political
scene.

When Walter Mondale was announced as President Carter’s
vice president, he vowed never to remain silent on pertinent
issues. He swore he would speak up and not assume the typical
role of vice president —- a_man on a four—year vacation. Now he
has tried to divorce himself from the more unpopular decisions
of the Carter White House. He claims that, in private, he
opposed development of the B-1 bomber and other lessthan
popular Carter moves. What happened to his promise that he
would speak his mind?

Mondale, though, has graciously accepted support from the
man he says,-now, he opposed so much. He has also accepted
endorsements from nearly everyone who tried to jump on the
bandwagon when he was thought to be invincible. Proving that
he has at least learned more than one thing from the man he
formerly served, he has made alliances and promises to ev-
eryone, and will worry about paying off his political patronage
after he is in office. Mondale will be the man forpeople who are
satisfied with letting their union or special interest group vote
and think for them.

Sen. Gary, Hart came along, in Iowa, to surprise Mr. Mon-
dale and the Democratic establishment. Hart forced them to
realize two things. First, the union endorsement was not a
fait-du-complit that all unionist would vote the party line.
Second, there are two new constituencies within the Demo-
cratic party.

Hart has presented some of the same solutions to some of the
same problems that Mondale has. But he has presented them to
one of these new groups. Hart’s support has come froma young
and rising middle class who have there eye on being the upper
middle class. Much of his support comes from the rumored Me
Generation and from less profit-motivated intellectuals who
see Hart as a more entertaining, more vivacious Mondale.

Finally, Jesse Jackson has proven more than any other
candidate that there are critical issues that are not being
addressed by the other Democrats. Jackson has appealed to the
second rising element in the Democratic party, the poor and the
disenfranchised. Jackson has also pointed out that people can

still unite behind idealism and win. He has brought the optim- ‘

ism of the '60s to the ’80s. He has also pointed out that no
Democratic candidate will receive the full support of his party
unless he recognizes and addresses the problems of this group.

The message is that the Democratic party is divided more
than it ever has been in recent elections —— on important and
valid issues and ideological differences. The division of the
Democrats exemplifies the deep political differences that exist
in this country. To try and force the Democrats to unite behind
the leader of one faction erodes the rationality of the demo-
cratic system. The differing views of the American people
should be allowed to be expressed, and if they can’t get satisfac-
tion from the party they are in, it’s time to form a new one.

Letters To The Editor

Pitt religious
leader upset
by ‘hurting’

remarks

By now, many people will have
responded to the opinion article by
Phyllis Gray, entitled “Censorship
claimed over ‘Palestinian,’ ” (The
Pitt News, Friday, March 30)." I
would like to clarify a few facts. It
has been'my standing practice as
Jewish chaplain at the university to
apprise the student affairs adminis-
trators of sensitive programs dealing
with the Arab-Israel conflict and to
obtain feedback and stimulate
dialogue. _

My concerns and responsibilities
are centered around sensitizing the
student affairs staff of the feelings of
the Jewish community and point of
view of Zionism. At no point in my
entire career have I been coercive or
threatening in my approach either
with students or staff of the
university.

I believe in freedom of speech and
in academic freedom within the uni-
versity. Just as I devote a great deal
of effortwith my fellow Zionist stu-
dents and faculty in trying to create a
positive direction for our move-
ment, I certainly respect the right of
authorized groups within the univer-
sity who differ from us to present
their point of view. _

What I found devastating and
deeply hurtful as one deeply sensi-
tive to the Holocaust and as a
teacher of Holocaust studies was the
statement “Both Zionist Israel and
the Third Reich of Hitler are repre-

sentative of capitalism at its most .

degenerate state: fascism." I am very
distressed that the author of “From
Where I Stand” found it necessary to
inject painful and. divisive state-
ments, whereas all of us who try to
work sensitively with students are
concerned, not only with the regen-

From where I stand/ Walter Ray Watson

eration and hope for realization of
our religious peoplehood’s speciﬁc
dreams, but the dreams‘of well-

4 meaning people everywhere.

The only good that did come of
the statement in The Pitt News was
that a number of sensitive university
students, Arab and Jew alike, called
to give me the benefit of the doubt

and to assume that I would be com- ‘

mitted to the principle of freedom of

, speech.’As deeply hurtful as Phyllis

Gray’s opinion statement was, these
conversations have been healing.

Nativity, not  
offensive and

not alone

In a recent article about the

Supreme Court decision permitting
local F governments to construct
Nativity scenes on public property,
the author failed to look at the big
picture. Christmas is a worldwide
celebration of one ofthe greatest fig-
ures in history. Even non—Christians

(Moslems for instance) acknow-
ledge Jesus as a great historical fig-
ure.

Christmas is a national holiday in
this country. Martin Luther King’s
birthday is soon to become one.
Should I be offended because a
black leader‘s birthday is a national
holiday because I’m not black? Cer-
tainly not. ‘

The author mentions Christmas
trees as “innocent."To many people,
there is strong religious symbolism
in Christmas trees. Nativity scenes
are not the only “religious” symbols
constructed by a local government.
Right here in Pittsburgh, the city
‘displays a Menorah during the cele-

bration of the Jewish holiday of
Hanukkah. Often, it is next to the
city’s Christmas tree in front of the
City County Building.

The ongoing presidential cam-.

will test the validity of Lincoln’s
statement: “You can fool all the peo-
ple some of the time; you can fool
some of the people all of the time;
but, you can’t fool.all the people all

. the time.”

It will also reveal the maturity of
the American voter.

Ben Franklin’s statement, “Expe-
rience is a hard school, but fools will
learn in no other,” has already been
amply proven.

City’s dying children need Jesse Jackson

April 5, I984. Dateline: William
Pitt Union Multi-Purpose Room.

Yes, this might be a pro-Jesse
Jackson column, but wait, this is not
the usual one where I, the writer of
this column, come out and say,
“Vote for a conscience in Demo-
cratic Party politics, vote Jesse" or
“He can’t win in July or November,

but we all can if on Tuesday..." No,
this is not that column. This one has
something to do with coincidences
and fate. F

It was a curious coincidence that I
heard Jesse Jackson speak yester-
day. I was between appointments
and was finishing up an interview
with a black physician at Magee

Womens Hospital on the problems
attached to solving the black infant
mortality rate in Pittsburgh, which,
according to 1982 national statistics,
is the highest of 26 urban popula-
tions. In wrapping up the interview,
the doctor brought up Democratic
presidential candidate Jackson and
his addressing of the concerns of

that campaign toward better health
care for the young as well as nutri-
tion and education.

“Hart or Mondale is going to have
to say, ‘OK, Jesse, you‘re not going
to make it as our nominee, but we'll
make some concessions to you ifyou
swing your voters to our camp.’ I
think it's beautiful — the role he's

playing in this campaign," the doc-
tor told me, smiling and looking
revived by discussing the hope he
believes Jackson has brought to the
political process by entering the
race.

“We've spent billions of dollars to
put a man on the moon -— and I

.lo'.i’t know how you assess it -—-V but
the return on that investment is min-
imal, not a businessman’s ven-
that kind of
investment for those kinds of
returns.... But we did it," he said,
“because it represented a vested
interest of a few. It takes far less
money to mop up the health care
problem in this country, but that’s
the vested interest of a minority.”
Walking from the hospital and
thinking of how I could work into
my story the attitude and feelings of
optimism with regard to the coun-
try’s future and Jackson’s role in

helping to somehow help determine
it, I decided to get lunch in the Stu-
dent Union. _

Upon entering the doors closest to
the Multi-Purpose Room, I was
immediately drawn to the rush of
people around ll:30 yesterday
morning moving into the area on my
right. I saw students and professors
and staff; people on their lunch
breaks and videocameras and tape
recorders and microphones. Finally,
a sprinkling of buttons with Jack-
son’s smiling countenance appeared
from the lapels and sweatshirts of
people walking and talking and
pouring their way into the audito-

rium. As I made my way to an empty
seat six rows back from the podium,
it wasn't hard to figure out what was
going on.

It was exciting to see a presiden-
tial candidate, no inatter how much
I try to deny it. With the exception of
a false alarm set off ingthe Union's
smoke and firealarm system, as far
as excitement goes, no one could ask
for more. The two Secret Service
agents assigned to the front of the
stage in their tan trench coats were
most typical in their cold,jaundiced
looks into the crowd; it was a sharp
contrast to the warm eye contact
that Jackson seemed to exude.

things are. He made them attentive

was irrepressible and moving,
which, for Jackon, seems to be no
great effort.

It was a curious thing for me to
hear Jackson speak, as he is wont to,
on issues that are the most passion-
ate to the groups he’s addressing.
Whether or not Jackson scores vic-
tories in the Pennsylvania primary
next week or the Democratic Con-

vention in San Francisco or on Elec-
tion Day ’84, he left an indelible
mark of optimism yesterday.

Was it more than just a coinci-
denoe that I heard Jackson and
spoke to a neonatologist concerned
about the next generations? Or was
it fate handing a generous metaphor
to use in writing about Jackson at a
unique distance? I’m not sure, but
either way, I personally will
remember and relish the experience,
considering the energy and thrill
that can be found at the heart of
American political matters when the
issues and voice on issues are
brought to the people.

Reagan, go back to-school on Vietnam

Ronald Reagan is a disturbed
man; once again he has substituted
ideology for brains. In his most
recent televised speech, ‘he pro-
claimed that the Vietnam interven-
tion was indeed a war and the United
States shouldhave called it as much.
If Corigressshad issued a declaration
of war, Reagan reasons, the govern-
ment could have prosecuted war
protesters and the United States
could have won. He is mad!

While many lessons of the Viet-
nam conflict are surely ambiguous

and probably have little " use as‘

guidelines in other conflicts, one
point has become very, very clear —

 the assumptions and objectives of

i

American policy-makers were
seriously flawed.

These planners assumed that the
United States could save Vietnam
from communism by killing
members of the Vietcong and saving
the Vietnamese people from them-
selves. This kind of rationale
resulted in such brilliant tactical
schemes as the Strategic Hamlet

program, in which Vietnamese vil- ~

.l-agers were rounded pp and kept in

I barbed-wire forts while the Vietcong

was left to roam the countryside.

This approach to the war was the ‘

source of the ﬂaw. It wasn't designed
to win the hearts and minds of the
masses, something on which one
would think a stable government
might depend. The war plan wasn’t
even designed to capture territory. It
was just a way of holding on and
blowing things up; punish the
enemy, and the people be damned.
This was worse than crazy, it was
stupid.

Say what you will about Lyndon
Johnson; he finally realized that he
made a mistake and that Vietnam
was a quagmire with no bottom. In
1968, he denied General Westmor-
land’s request for an additional
200,000 troops. Soon afterwards,

Johnson announced that he
wouldn’t run for re-election. He had
that much decency, at least.

No, the protestors weren’t the
problem in Vietnam; the basic
assumptions about U.S. priorities

and containment were the problem.
The protestors were raising legiti-
mate grievances and complaints
about a senseless war. Reagan, how-
ever, finds this annoying. It hampers
the ability of government to do as it
pleases.

Accountability is indeed a nui-
sance, especially if you have some-
thing to hide — like an Ed Meese ——
or if you constantly have to justify
your bungled policies — like the
handling of the Lebanon situation.

Even these mistakes would be tol-

erable if it weren't for Reagan's atti-
tude toward them. It is as though
they are problems that were created
by the media or a small group of
malcontents. The president is
troubled by a free press and an open
society; his job would be so much
easier if he ‘could only. suppress
dissent. .

But the most importantjob of the
president is to convince. Convincing
can be hard work, though, especially
when you aren’t " really sure‘ what
vou’re talking about. '

Ronald Reagan hasn’t learned
anything from Vietnam, and it
seems tha_tTie h_a‘§Yi‘t learned much
from Lebanon, either. Maybe you
can ‘I teach an old dog new tricks.
Maybe Reagan will be condemned
to view the world through ideologi-
cal lenses for the rest 'of his life, and
maybe he shouldn’t be re-elected.

As it stands right now, there are
three viable alternatives to Mr. Rea-
gan. The time to act is now; the time
for change is now. Accept your
accountability and retire Reagan.

Hart rallies local support

By Catherine Save!
The Pitt News

Democratic candidate Senator
Gary Hart promised a Market
Square crowd yesterday he would
put a halt to cuts in education pro-
grams at the federal level “ranging
from school lunches for the poor to
Guaranteed Student Loans.”

Hart reminded the crowd that he
had introduced the American
Defense Education Act three years
ago. His campaign emphasis is on
increasing an investment in the
human mind which, he said, “is the
greatest asset our nation has.”

“We cannot afford a nuclear arms
race that threatens the security of
mankind,” Hart said. Hart
explained he will pay for his educa-
tion programs by ceasing produc-

tion of the MX missile and B-I

bomber.

“Americans must lead the world
and provide targeted economic and
technical assistance to underdeve-
loped countries that comprise two-
thirds of the world.

“We cannot afford four more
years of Reaganomics," Hart said.
He referred to the $200 billion deficit
of the Reagan administration as an
“economic Vietnam for the nation.”

“You do matter, you do count, we
want» you to know your voice is
important,” s-aid Carole King, popu-
Iar singer supporting Hart at the
rall .

Democratic candidate Gary Hart left on a positive
note after speaking to supporters yesterday.

Allegheny County Commission-
ers Pete F laherty and Tom Forester
also came out to show their support.

Flaherty suggested that voters do
not make their choices on the basis
of someone else’s endorsements.
Hart, he said, is “the first president
ever to refuse contributions from
Political Action Committees.”

Hart told supporters he is the one
who can send Ronald Reagan back
to the ranch.

Local college students present at

“Of the students who do vote, 75
percent will vote for Hart,” said Jeff
Graham, Pitt campus coordinator
for Hart. He said the turnout for
both the dowtown rally and Carole

Debate maintains Civility 

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

The three remaining contenders
for theDemocraticpresidental nomi-
nation came to the David Lawrence’
Convention center last night to
debate the issues of the campaign,
not to assail personalities, and while
the hour-long discussion spared per-
sonal attack, it provided little in the
way of a breakthrough in this
campaign.

Jesse Jackson, Walter Mondale
and Gary Hart took part in the third
debate sponsored by the League of
Women Voters and broadcast live to
a television audience here and across
the state in Philadelphia.

Each attempted to reinforce
themes in their campaigns —- Hart
trying to associate himself with the
symbol of political youth, John
Kennedy; Mondale using small-
town colloquialism in his repeated
reference to “those God-awful
nuclear weapons"; and Jackson cal-
ling for a “new direction" for the
Democraticparty.

The glaring issue of unemploy-
ment and the dying industry of the
western Pennsylvania area also
received preterential treatment by
the candidates and scattered
applause from the crowd made up
almost solely of league officials and
dignitaries". '

All three candidates came to Pitts-
burgh yesterday in the hope of
courting some or all of Pennsylva-
nia's I I7 convention delegates to be
contested next Tuesday in the state’s
primary.

Jackson and Mondale pass the grin....

Wednesday with an unemployed
steel worker and his family in
Homestead, drew the night’s most
consistent applause with his calls to
“put America back to work."

Hart, often considered a suppor-
ter of the new industrial revolution
of high-tech companies, put on a
more traditional face by supporting
the idea that “the Keystone indus-
tries — steel and machine tooling —
have a tremendous spill-over effect
on the economy.”

League organizers found them-
selves with five -fewer candidates
than in the earlier debates and took
pains to keep the responses briefand
to a
minimum.

Debate moderator Elizabeth
Drew, a television commentatorand
political journalist. repeatedly

reminded the candidates ofthe need

for brevity during the commercial-
free live telecast.

Hart more than once attempted to
draw parallels between the views
and outlooks of the three men
onstage, and in doing so, avoided
the defensive stance observers felt he
assumed during the last debate held
March 25 at Columbia University.

Hart said, “Fritz, Jesse and I are
all committed" to effectively change
the course of the Democraticparty.
He asked
“degree of commitment.”

Drew’s attempts to pin down the
three on the issue of rising deficits
brought Tmore of the candidates‘
calls for revitalization of basic
industry —- particularly steel -—— and
gave this debate a decidedly more
domestic tone, something for which

I organizers had both expected and

hoped.

THE PITTSBURGH RECORD FAIR 

-7.’

is

By WES COTTER

"1, 2, 3, and make the lines of your
arm smooth; bring it in, and step,
step, step. Stop the music; that diago-
nal was terrible." The ballet mistress
maneuvers her ballerinas into a per-
fect line after several tries that were
less" than successful. Her day is
demanding, always watching — look-
ing for the little mistakes —— but
tougher still is the 9 to 6 day of the
corps dancer who works endless
hours in the pursuit of a solo role.

Jacquelyne Lywen is a corps dancer
with the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre.
She works day after day in the studio
with the hope that, someday, she will
be able to step away from the group
and walk into the spotlight alone. But
for now, she dances in the company
and perfects subtle lines that her

'body must assume: the smooth bend

of the wrist andlthe gentle grace of a
perfect twirl that separate the good
ballet dancers from the great.

In her pursuit of this dream, she
has moved from her home in Fresno
to Philadelphia, New York and,
finally," Pittsburgh. Lywen started
dancing at a young agefor the simple
reason that her mother had been a
soloist with the Radio City Music
Hall Ballet, and it seemed the natural
thing to do. ”My mother was a
dancer, and I really never knew any-
thing different,” she says. ”I think
that's the way with a lot of dancers;
people ask you what you want to be
when you grow up, and you say a
dancer.”

It might work this way for most
dancers, but Lywen took a slightly
different path when she discovered
that she was bored with dancing in
high school. At this time in life, most
dancers quit school and go to New
York to start a professional career,
but Lywen decided to quit for a while
and reflect on her real reasons for
dancing. After her period of intros-
pection, she re-entered the profes-
sion with zeal and now can talk
openly about the life of a dancer from
both sides of the fence.

Lywen started her career in the
Fresno area and came to Pennsylva-
nia after she received a scholarship
from the School of the Pennsylvania
Ballet. Shortly afterward, she earned
a scholarship from the renowned lof-
frey Ballet, where she has just com-
pleted her second season.

Lywen freely admits that life in
ballet was once confusing. ”It was

important for me to take a break and

to realize that was what I wanted. I
had to know for myself, not just
because my parents put me in it."

It turned out that she did want to
dance and has worked hard to get
where she is today. ’’I really wasn't
thinking ahead to being a profes-
sional ballet dancer. I wanted so much
to be good that I worked so hard and
developed so fast that, within a year, I
was off on a scholarship," she says.

Ballet was easy for her in some
respects, but in others, she struggled
through by doing things the hard
way. Most promising dancers quit
high school and move to New York to
pursue dancing on a full-time basis.
Lywen broke the mold and finished
high school as well as a year of under-
graduate work at UCLA. She isn't
embarrassed by the fact that she was
unsure about her direction. Rather,
she says, "I'm well rounded. I can't
stand obsessiveness with ballet.
Many dancers are obsessive and
because of it, they aren't as good
actors or performers. But it's not just

getting up there and doing perfected
steps on a stage with a big smile on
your face." "

Lywen spent her time away from
the ballet in the community theater
and dance, and she says she is much
richer for it. .

It is this richness that Lywen most
appreciates in performers who are
dedicated to their craft. "If you do
make the sacrifices, it's worth it, but
if you don't make all that really need
to make, it probably doesn't do for
you what you wanted. If you do,
though, it's as wonderful a high as
any high."

To gain this high, the average
dancer works six days a week. Lywen
said that the PBT company works for
five, with Saturday and Sunday off.
She added that it5s pretty easy to get
run down dancing everyday and then
giving it your all at the time of perfor-
mances. ”During Nutcracker, when we
had two performances a day plus a lot
of the tension that comes with per-
forming, I got sick. When you have a
week straight of that, seven days, it’s
pretty easy to get run down and catch
a cold.”

In addition to the daily aches and
pains, most professional dancers
suffer from the residual effects that
come with t,heir_time_ in the spotlight.

Toe-ine The Line

When asked if she is concerned about
the long-term effects on her body,
Lywen says that it comes with the
job. She adds that the incidence of
injuries in ballet is no worse than that
of other athletic professions. She
does admit that the gnarled feet of
dancers are "the only part of their
bodies that aren't beautiful.”

She follows this by saying that the
endurance a dancer has doesn't come
over night. ”It's something you build
up. That's why you start young. It
becomes more natural with time. It's

not always so comfortable, and it”

does cause a lot of pain. But it's also
mental, like yoga; you can lift your-
self above the pain."

Lywen says that the really great
dancers are able to use their minds to
make them float on their toes, above
the pain. She explains that it's not
mysterious; they just concentrate on
the precision of the move —— that's
what makes it look special. She says
that for a dancer at her level, it is
important to work on mental train-
ing. ”I have dreams, of course, of
being a principal dancer. Solo roles
are what I'm looking at right now.
From there, you grow into becoming
a principal — that's all in the distance
for me right now.”

She says that: for now: dancing in

the PBT company is satisfying but
adds that she has _a variety of inter-
ests. With a former ballerina for a
mother and a concertmaster and sol-

oist from the New York Philhar-/V

monic for a father, Lywen had no
choice but to learn a variety of artistic
skills. She can play both the piano and
the violin, draw, dance and act.
Lywen lives on Mount Washing-
ton, where many members of the
PBT company have taken up resi-'
dence. Lywen says that she has
learned to love this city in spite of
what people told her when she moved
here. "Everybody told me how awful
Pittsburgh was going to be, but when
I walk home at night and look up at
Mount Washington, I can't help but
think what a beautiful city this really

II

IS.

Lywen is currently on tour with
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre Com-
pany, which is visiting selected cities
in the South. The troupe will be there
for the remainder of this month.
Lywen said that she plans a long
career in dance and would like to stay
in Pittsburgh. She can be seen danc-
ing this summer in the park perfor-
mances put on by the ballet, and she
will also dance with the PBT when it

presents its seasonal repertoire.

By LISA LavALLi-:'

somewhere in Colombia. When a
friend inquires, "Have they found the
- body yet?" it's typical of the delights
in Diane Thomas’ script for Turner to
reply, ”Only one piece." When
Turner's sister calls from Colombia
and explains that she needs a hand,
Turner naively rushes down to help.
What she doesn't know is that, one,
her sister is being held captive by
American thugs searching for a fabu-
lous buried treasure; two, that brutal
Colombian secret police are also look-
ing for the treasure; and three, that
she, Turner, holds the key to it all.
Alas, while roam-ing through the
jungles of South America, she is also
destined to find the man of her
dreams —- her ”Jesse.” However, this
true-life Jesse goes by the name of
Jack Colton, alias Michael Douglas
(who also produces the film). At first,
in the time—honored tradition of 
these\types of films, the two get along
about as well as James Watt did with
the environmentalists. Eventually,
with the passing of time, they fall
passionately in love with each other.
Kathleen Turner is not‘ cfiiite as
sexy as she was in Body Heat or as
funny as she was in The Man With Two
Brains, but she plays a complete char-
acter this time around. The film gives
her plenty of opportunities to use her
considerable gifts for both eroticism
and humor. Douglas is right enough
for his part, and the support —— partic-
ularly Danny DeVito as a bumbling

First of all, never mind the title,
Romancing The Stone — it's the only

romlance/adventure that doesn't
work.

Everything else in Romancing the
Stone works overtime, providing
almost two hours of fun. It's not pro-

picture has more slick moves than a
Michael Jackson video.

Romancing the Stone has been com-
pared many times to Raiders of the Lost
Ark, but the similarity is really limited
to the fact that both borrow freely
from escapist traditions. Of the two,
Romancing the Stone is lighter fare and
more successful when it adheres to
this description.

The film has a lot going for it.
There is a devil-may—care hero who
can handle a weapon and a wisecrack

chases, great stunt work and numer?

TALK SHOW
The Go—Go's
I.R.S.

When Vacation was released
nearly two years ago, it was a
definite step down for The Go-
Go's, America's favorite all-girl

group. Their first album, Beauty '

and the Beat, buoyed by the
unstoppable rhythms of hits
like ”Our Lips Are Se.aled" and
choice fillers like "Skidmarks
On My Heart" and "Our
Town," spent months climbing
the charts and finally settled at
number one, where it stayed for
several weeks. In July of 1982,
Vacation was released to a Go-
Go’s—crazed public, who
snatched up the first few copies
but soonmoved on when they
couldn't find a song as catchy as
”We Got The Beat.” Of course,
Vacation wasn't a complete fail-
ure, as it skittered to the top ten
before taking a nosedive, but,
compared to their debut lp, it
-wasn't what everyone had
hoped for, either. Even those of
us who'd sworn everlasting loy-
alty after turning our copies of
Beauty and the Beat white with
turntable speed had to admit the
follow-up left much ‘to be
desired. Whereas the first
album made you wanna lose
your head with its cool, cornball
thoughts ("...I buy cologne/you
want axel grease/You say ‘Get a
" mechanic’/I say ‘Get a
shrink!'..."), the second release
made you wanna turn your
head with its, overly melodra-
matic lyrics and a truly distaste-
ful version of ”Cool Jerk."
The Go—Go's needed some
time off to think things out and

refuel, and-,.so, they themselves) P

took a vacation. Belinda, who's

always wanted to be a movie
star in the Golden Age of Holly-
wood vein, made her acting
debut in Swing Shift, Goldie
Hawn’s new movie, and moved

V in with an L.A. Dodger; Jane

Wiedlin hooked up with Sparks,
touring with the Mael's and hit-
ting the top 20 with "Cool Pla-
ces”; the other girls kept their

Nona Hendryx's 1983 album), '

and Charlotte Caffey developed
a mysterious wrist ailment
called "carpeI tunnel syn-
drome,” which wreaked havoc
with any plans the band had
made to record and tour. When

at last the girls came together ‘

again, it was decided that the
next album would be recorded
in a different country -—— Eng-
land — and with a different pro-

’ ducer (Richard Gottehrer had

produced their previous efforts)
— Martin Rushent — at the
boards. Thus, Talk Show is now
available in stores everywhere.

And not only is it available,
but Talk Show” is definitely worth

buying. Deeper than -previous,

efforts, the lp nonetheless gives
the impression of being nothing
more than surface pop. How-
ever, the best records have

always made it seem easy, and ‘

that's just what The Go—Go's
have done with thislp. Be atten-
tive, though, and you'll notice
changes, subtle as they are.
Kathy Valentine's bass lines are
all over the place, adding tex-

~ture and backbone almost

imperceptibly ("Beneath The
Blue Sky” is a good example);
Caffey, whose" wrist problems
still plagued her when .this

, album was recorded and, thus,

THE GO-GO’S_

limited her contributions to lead
guitar, adds the rollicking sound

.of keyboards to the lp —— a wel-

come change that ought to
become a mainstay in the
future; and Wiedlin’s songwrit-
ing has become more confident
and straightforward (she wrote
or co—wrote the majority of the
album's material). Carlisle takes
more chances with her voice
here, expressing emotion better
and, overall, sounding more
mature than she has in the past.

A; striking feature of Talk Show '
(no, I don't know where the title‘

came from) is the meshing of
unique lyric and melody. This
might not sound like a difficult
or distinctive feat — after all,
lyric and melody exist in every

mind-boggling for two things

balanced. L

MEAT PUPPETS II

» The Meat Puppets

SST Records

The Phoenix—based Meat

Puppets are immediately access-

ible by virtue of their playfully
humorous name. Not nearly as
accessible, though certainly
worth the effort, is the band's
fascinating fusion of sound,
which frequently challenges the
established borders of the bass,
guitar and drum.

‘ The‘ band's‘ second release,
Meat Puppets II offers various
combinations of hardcore, psy-
chedelic and country rock. The
versatility the band shows
politely sidesteps any possible
definition. Lead singer and
songwriter Curt Kirkwood
overhauls his voice from song to
song, while his guitar playing
shifts with similar ease.

Although some ofthe songs
on Meat Puppets II have obvious

‘influences (”Split Myself in

Two” is a classic hardcore
thrasher, while ”Climb" is

album, as well —- you give ita
chance and listen to it several
times before passing judgment.
The songs on Talk Show aren't as
simple as "Our Lips Are Sealed"
or ”We Got The Beat," but they
are better, and given a chance,
they'll grow on you. Follow-up
singles could be just about any-
thing, but bet on the '60s psy-
chedelic feel behind "Capture
The Light" or the bounce of
”Yes Or No" (co—written by Ron
and Russell Mael, a.k.a. Sparks)
to make it to the top 20.

Valentine recently said, "It's
no big deal to have an all-girl
band anymore. And while we've
always appealed to a pretty wide
audience, this album (Talk Show)
should substantiate that appeal.
It will show people what we're
capable of." She's’ right; that
The Go-Go's are girls really
doesn't matter anymore. The
fact that they're now an estab-
lished band who've grown into a
musical force who can stand

their own ground against‘

anyone —— that's what really
matters.

plainly country rock and

nothing else), the vast majority
of the album is difficult to pin
down. Instrumentals ”Aurora
Borealis" and "I'm a Mindless
Idiot," for instance, are musical
melting pots that simply sound
good.

For the most part, Meat Puppets
II is enjoyable for the way it slips
and slides around conventional
labels. Beyond that, however,
are three talented musicians
who offer a dozen songs that
prove worthwhile. listening
moreloften than not.

Twelve songs in less than 32
minutes is a pretty furious-pace,
but listen closely: 32 minutes of
the Meat Puppets is no waste of
time.

BAD MUSIC FOR BAD
PEOPLE

TheCramps

I.R.S.

What can you say about a
band with a name like ”The
Cramps" and a lineup that
includes folks called Lux Inte-
rior, Poison Ivy and Congo
Powers? Ummmm...you could
say they're gutsy, original,
bizarre and, yeah, once you get
past the wordplay, a good band
to boot.

The Cramps’ roots are firmly
entrenched in that ever-popular
rockabilly soil, but, don't let that
deter you from becoming a
believer. This band doesn't
believe in the revivalist mimick-
ing of, say, The Stray Cats;
when it comes to rockabilly, The
Cramps don't merely pay hom-
age to the genre by imitating it
— note for note — and putting
their own names on the credits.
Lt would appear that The
Cramps aren't interested in
regurgitation, so, instead,
they've set out to play the
modern—day equivalent of rock-
abilly: a brand of outrageous,
mind—bending music designed
to unsettle your bones and
threaten your brain. And this
they've done, from the opening
notes of unofficial classics like
"Garbageman" and ”Goo Goo
Muck," to the unrestrained
bashings of "New Kind of Kick"
and "TV Set."

Did I say "rockabilly" before?
Hardly adequate; "garage
shockabilly" is more like it,
given their penchant for stran-
gely horrorific lyrics and titles
like "Human Fly." Last word: if
this really is bad music for bad
people, then by all means, be
bad, truly bad, and buy this disc.

LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Me," it's a real pleasant sort of
unpleasantness.

The only time Ullman comes
close to capturing the original
magic of the '60s girl group is on
a new song, "They Don't
KHOW," which was written by
her friend Kristy MacColl (no
doubt a pleasant woman). With
its bell chimes and backing
"doot—doot-doots" by the
Wealthy Tarts, this really
sounds like a closet classic and is
supposedly making headway as
her first single on U.S. charts.

What Ullman doesn't seem to
realize is that the girl groups of
the '60s didn't start out as actors
and models looking for another
feather to add to their caps;
most were hungry teenagers
looking for a hit single to make
them big. Consequently, their
songs had an edge that Ullman,

as a successful dilettante, can't-

duplicate.

Hot on the heels of Big Coun-

about a British model/actress
who records an entire album of
other people's songs, most of
them '60s classics like Jackie De
Shannon's "Breakaway," the
Dells’ ”Oh, What A Night" and
Doris Day's "Move Over

wrangle her way onto MTV for
a week—long spot as guest V]?
Say she's pleasant, and then try
to ignore all the mega-
promotion.

Essentially, pleasantry is the
foundation of You Broke My Heart
In 17 Places. Ullman’s got a plea-
sant voice that sounds some-
where between early Diana
Ross and present Michael Jack-
son. She uses it in a pleasant,
unsoulful way to sing through
11 pleasant songs. The overall
effect is very pleasant, and

THREE or A PERFECT PAIR?
King Crimson
Warner Brothers

Sure, sure. I realize that these
guys are generally throught of
as music's enigmatic progres-
sives. But what on earth is fresh
or progressive about their new-
est album? Honestly, Crimson-
ites, I tried to like Three ofa Perfect
Pair, I pleaded with myself, say-
ing things like "Come on you
have to like it. It's Crimson,
man. CRIM-son!" I hid from
this review for days.

This album, nine cuts in all
(five with vocals and four —- .7),

-is yet another manifestation of

pretentiousness from a band
that insists on bastardizing its
talents in the name of ”art.” I
suppose the method to the mad-
ness is to throw a few near-
accessible tracks -—- some rather
good ones at that (The title cut,
"Sleepless" and "Man With An
Open -Heart’’)«—— on the 1p and
then fill the balance of vinyl
with that stuff that musical art
is made of, whatever that is.
You know, something to insure
some sales, keep t-he artist alive,
put food in the stomach and so
on. Fine. Hey, "St. Elmo's Fire,"

”I'll Come Running,” Eno’s '

Another Green World. Great stuff.
Atmosphere.

But the atmosphere, if indeed
there is any one can trap with
his ear, on this latest from
Crimson is, at best,‘ sketchy.
The vocals feature Adrian
Belew. His wailing voice careens
through the more palatable por-
tions of the album. Not bad at
all. Which leaves us with the

. instrumental tracks (and they

are lllooonnnggg). They make

I time for a good, swift escape. '

Showcase, April 6, 1984 A .

Three of a Perfect Pair is one of
those albums that, when it beg-
ins, one sets the volume to
seven or eight and sits back to
enjoy the fine guitar of Fripp
and Belew and the thumping
percussion and bass of Bruford
and Levin, respectively. It is. a
shame that the instrumental
excursions are almost enough
to make two aspirins a neces-
sity. Be serious, fellows. It is

3 about time that Fripp et at decide
as to what it is they are trying to

do. Do they want to be accessi-
ble or don't they? If they do,
they should can the pretentions;
if they don't, they ought to stop
baiting the public and be an art
band. Take your lumps in the
sales race like other ”artists.”

There is nothing on this
album we haven't heard before,
and that by and of itself, is not a
problem. But when one goes
around under the guise of pro-
gressive, the problem surfaces.

Frippertronics and more Frip-
pertronics. Came out better on
Discipline and Beat. "Nuages
(That Which Passes, Passes like
Clouds)" sounds like a drum and
synth embellished piece from
Fripp's 1980 lp God Save The
Queen. And "Industry.” Nothing
that Eno hasn't already done
and done better.

"One, one too many
schizophrenic tendencies
keeps it complicated

keeps it aggravated

and full of this hopelessness
what a perfect mess."

. ——Adrian Belew, from the title

track.
Couldn't have summed it up
better.

THE CORE
The Core
Little Beat Productions

The Core's ability as a live
band has been proven by now,
not only in the Pittsburgh area,
but outside the Golden Triangle
as well.

However, the band's new
four—song mini-cassette
entitled simply The Core gives
little indication of the band's
frequently displayed exuber-
ance.

Once known as Pittsburgh's
reggae masters, The Core do lit-
tle more than touch base with
their main influence on- this
release. .

The opener, "Love is Around
You," is pop, pure and simple.
And unimaginative. The sappy
lyrics and bland vocals go abso-
lutely nowhere. Worse yet, the

final song, "Power of a

Woman,'' is a mix of influences

Don't Let The Little Guys Fool You! ll

You've Tried The Rest
Now Try The Best  

CAPRI PIZZA    

whose sum total is a waste of
nearly four and a half minutes.

In between, though, are two
songs, "While You Were Out"
and "My Friend," that provide a
ray of hope for one of Pitts-
burgh's own.

These two numbers are true
to The Core’s musical roots; the
formerfeaturing a nice open
chord guitar and some slick
vocal effects, with the latter
offering the recording's only
moment of energy thanks to
Marc Reisman’s flashy saxo-

phone and Kenny Crisafio's
playfully sparse drumming.
While the departure of singer
Tony Miles has certainly
created problems for The Core,
presence, of course, isn't every-
thing. Through both its good
and bad moments, The Core
proves that there is more to suc-

_ cess than that. «

Pitt opens
season
without
Kingdom

By Charlie O'Hara 
The Pitt News

They’ll be doing it without the ser-
vices of two-time NCAA hurdles
champion Roger Kingdom, but the
Panther track team will open its out-
door season today at Williamsburg,
Va., in the Colonial Relays.

*‘I’m taking a redshirt [sitting out
but not forfeiting eligibility] for the
outdoor season becausel need the
time off to rest and get a chance to
do well on my finals,” Kingdom
said. “I'll begin training again in a
couple weeks when I start working
toward the Olympic trials [in J une].”

The Panthers, who finished elev—~

enth in the country (the highest
among Pitt sports teams for 1983-
84) during the indoor season, expect
quality performances to abound this
outdoor campaign.

Pitt coach John Vasvary, how’-
ever, maintains that the Colonial

Relays will be used more as a prepa-»

ration meet for the bigger and more
competitive meets to come later in
the season.

“We want to see where a lot of the

guys are in their training,” Vasvary

said. ‘‘There’s been a lot of hard

work done in practice from the
indoor season up to this point and
the meet should give some good
indication of where we stand.”

The Colonial Relays draws teams
from the Eastern and Southern
regions, but most of them have the
same objective that the Panthers do:
open the season and find out from a
racing standpoint just where their
particular team is.

Vasvary has entered 18 of the
Panthers in 14 different events. Pitt
will ﬁeld six relay teams (the shuttle
hurdle, the sprint medley, the dis-
tance medley, the 6400—meter, the
3200-meter and the 400—meter).

Vasvary believes that the distance
medley (8_00x400xl200xl600) team
of All-Americas Todd Colas, Bill
Moorhead and Garland Brown and
freshma_n Alan Laws should be right
among the top teams this weekend,
in addition to making a strong bid
for NCAA championship
qualification. .

The shuttle hurdle (4xll0) team.

of Panther basketballer Darryl She-
pherd, former Panther footballer
Joe McCall and freshmen Jason
Harris and Jeff Longbottom should
get plenty of attention for more than
having a successful football and bas-
ketball player.

The sprint medley (200x200x400x
800) team will be composed of fresh-
man Jesse Mikell, Harris, Laws and
Colas. Mickey Rihtarchik, John
Thomas, Bob Weiner and Moor~
head make up the 6400-meter
(4xl600) team. _ 

The 3200-meter (4x800) team is
scheduled to be Pat Moran, .Tim
Manes, Moorhead and Brown,
while McCall, Laws, Mikell and

Spokesman Bill -

Pitt All—America tackle Bill Fralic will be among one of 13
collegiate athletes participating in the NCAA Fiesta Bowl drug
education promotion program. .

The athletes will travel to Phoenix May 19-22 to work in
community functions as well as to tape their 30-second promo-
tions, scheduled for broadcast during the upcoming college
football season and the 1985 NCAA basketball
championships.

Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie, Auburn running
back Bo Jackson and Navy running back Napoleon McCal1um
will join Fralic in the promotion.

Spring notes

Although weighing only 200 lbs., a rather small size for a college
linebacker, sophomore-to-be Steve Apke continues to impress the Pitt
coaching staff in spring practices. _

“He has a knack for finding the football, and when he does find it,
he tackles you,” defensive coordinator Bob Junko said. “Also, he
plays‘ at a higher intensity‘ than most players. At his size he couldn’t
play if he weren’t_that way.” In his first start in the Fiesta Bowl, Apke
made a team—high 14 tackles against Ohio_State. I

According to Junko, defensive end Chris‘Doleman, linebacker
Troy Benson and tackles Tim Quense and Lorenzo. Freeman are
having good springs.
