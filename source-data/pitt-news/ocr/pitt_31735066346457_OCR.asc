BAS, Programming OK
SG Concert Guidelines

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

- The Black Action Society
(BAS) and the Student Government
programming committee have
agreed to co—produce this year’s
Black Week concert according to
Student Government Board (SGB)
guidelines established last Friday.

The concert has been a contro-
versial issue between BAS and
SGB since spring term when
student activities fee funds were
allocated to student groups.

SGB provided both the program-
ming committee and BAS with a
copy of specific guidelines Friday
outlining each committees’ obliga-
tions.

BAS is responsible for choosing
the group and advertising for the
concert, * which will be held in
November. The SG programming
committee will be responsible for
all contracting and other arrange-
ments, according to the guidelines.

In the spring, the SG allocations
committee recommended to SGB
that money for the Black Week
concert be put in the programming
account and that programming
produce the concert, although BAS
still was supposed to choose the
group. At that time, both SG
programming and BAS were
unwilling to follow the suggestion.

Until late last week, BAS
programming chairman Joy Wilson
and SG programming chairmen Bill
Lurye and Tim Stoops expressed
concern that co-production would

be impossible. The Black Week
concert has been handled by BAS
in previous years.

Wilson and Lurye admitted
there was some confusion regard-
ing the responsibilities of each
group in the production of the

concert.
Yesterday Stoops said the

programming committee would go
along with the guidelines. “We’ll
do our best to make it work.” he
said.

Wilson also said BAS would
support the guidelines. “BAS does
not like the idea of SG program-
ming producing our concerts, but
we’ll go along with it because we
do want a good Black Week
concert.”

Wilson said she did not know
whether SG programming involve-
ment with the concert would affect
attendance of black students at the
Black Week concert. “We would
like to have BAS as the sole
producer of the concert, but we will
not discourage black students from
attending," Wilson said.

The allocations committee had
originally recommended co-
production of the concert as part of
an overall move by the committee
to provide a more consistent
programming policy.

Wilson remarked yesterday she
could forsee similar difﬁculties
with the production of a spring
concert, another concert the
allocations committee had recom-
mended be co-produced by SG
programming and BAS.

Jimmy Carter Brings “Whistle stop" To Pittsburgh

BY MREA CSORBA

Presidential candidate Jimmy
Carter brought his “Train for a
Change" in for a whistle stop at
Pittsburgh's Pennsylvania Station
Monday night. i

Carter, at his last stop on a New
York-to-Chicago tour, evoked im-
ages of Harry Truman, the
originator of the whistle—stop
campaign.

Carter’s running mate, Senator
Walter Mondale, joined Carter at
the station for an address to the
enthusiastic Pittsburgh audience.
Despite a strong showing of
anti-abortion lobbyists, the Carter
and Mondale speeches were
uninterrupted by the anti-abortion
groups. Several times, back-row
Carter supporters chanted “Put
down the signs" to pro-life
demonstrators holding signs that
blocked the view of the podium.

In his speech Carter played the
partisan angle heavily against
Ford. saying Nixon knew what he
was doing when he appointed Ford
vice president. Carter said Ford
personiﬁes the Republican party.

He asked the crowd to think back
on the Republican administrations
during the last 20 years and to
compare the achievements of those
administrations against the pro-
gress made by the Roosevelt~Tru-
man and Kennedy-Johnson admin-
istrations. L

Carter blamed the current
unemployment rate on the Repub-
lican administration. “Unemploy-
ment was 6‘/2 % when Ford took
office. Now it stands at 7.9 %.
Two and a half million more people
are now unemployed than when
Ford took office," Carter said.

Cafter acknowledged the support
Pennsylvanians offered him in the
primary and asked that they
respond similarly in November for
a Democratic victory. “We have
been divided too long. We must
take back the government from
special interest groups and return
it to the people."

Carter projected that his admin-
istration would be similar to
Truman's administration. “With
Turman. you always knew who was
the president. If he made a
mistake, it was his mistake. The

A standard threat from par-
ents to their children’ has always
been: “Wait until you get out into
the real world. Then you’ll see
what a rat race life really is. You’ll
won’t be able to take it. You’ll
crack up!”

Unfortunately, in the rat race of
life, many students never even
make it out of the starting gate.
That tenuous thing known as
mental sanity sometimes crumples
like a wet Dixie cup under the
strains and pressures of college life
where one’s beliefs are always
being challenged and where a
student is forced to achieve.
Depression, anxieties, troubles
with life styles and interpersonal

problems are
college students.

At Pitt, the Clinical Psychology
Center, located on the sixth and
seventh ﬂoors of Old ‘Engineering
Hall, tries to correct the mental
disorder or personal problems of
any student who asks for help. In
addition to treating students, the
center also acts as a training clinic
where graduate psychology stu-
dents get experience in case work,

faculty from the psychology de-
partment.

Individuals are seen on a

pertains to their case.

Since all treatment is done in
rooms equipped with two-way
mirrors and video tape equipment,
all patients must sign releases
permitting the taping of their
sessions with the clinical workers.

“There are some people who get
a bit uptight when we tell them that
we have to tape the sessions,” said

You think there’d be more of a
crowd here than just this band of
sign-toting anti-abortionists. It’s
an hour before this show gets
going, and there’s hardly enough
fanfare to welcome one’s Uncle
Henry as he steps off the Cleveland
midnight special.

A good sixty or seventy right-to-
lifers line the long retaining rope.

stage area. It all happens under

And yet when this is all over
and the kids go home and head for
puberty, how many of them will be
bound for, as their leaﬂets describe
it, the “clinic that will today deny

one child every 15 minutes the

chance to be born...”

In front of the rope that contains
the sign-bearers is about 15 feet of
space strewn with wires and booby-'
trapped with sockets and lumps of

’ wrapped electrical tape, then the

wooden horse barricades, then six
feet to the stage.

I work around the side to get to
the section in front of the podium.

_The place is still empty so he
doesn’t have any trouble keeping
an eye on me. He is formidable in
trench coat, your typical
textbook secret service agent.

“Credentials?" he barely smi-
les. Everyone else who’s behind
the lines has either a large paper
dog tag around the neck or a secret
service pin on the lapel. All I have
on my chest is a gold ’”“Pitt.”
Gothic script notwithstanding, I
don't think it would work.

I butt my way into the
conversation of an order-
givingwoman in a blue raincoat.
She has tags and buttons galore.

“Press credentials at the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel. Riverboat Room.
Long as you have your press ID,"
she said, the ﬁrst human teletype.

Why do they put hotels so far

_ away from train stations? I guess

taxi drivers carry a lot of clout.
Despite jeans, musty looking

corduroy jacket, and a mustache

(struggling into its ninth day, I’m
not plucked from among the $300
suits hobnobbing around the lobby
and lounges. Looking fo subver-

sives they were not. I ﬁnd the
Riverboat Room, and two sorority-
president-types great me cheerily
(I don't like the word either, but
that's just the way it was). I take
out my press ID, and oh my God
it's expired!

The blonde takes it, asks for
driver's license, begins typing my
pass; the brunette asks me for date
and place of birth, I get my cards
back and a press pass on a little
noose that “must be displayed
prominently at all times.” I’m off
to the races on a pass issued on an
ID that's no damn good, and for all
anyone knows, the ID could’ve
been faked at some 12th-ﬂoor dive
.in Oakland that forges passports
for presidential and vice presiden-
tial assassins. Boy that would be
history, wouldn't it?

Back at the station things are
getting a little thicker. A man in a
red knit shirt is scampering from
sign to sign, -instructing the
predominantly female group on
how to hold it, what to do when the
crowd gets thicker, and how to act
when Carter comes on.

A country & western band starts
up. Two hefty hillbilly women in
stark blue pants suits, one on
geetar, the other on some kind of
stripped down tambourine, lead
three Kentucky coal miner types,
big ears, spangled western ties,
pale complexions.

After about the third song,
someone wisely leads a chant of
“We want Carter,” drowning the
“music” and sending chills up the
spines of the anti-abortionists, now
well outnumbered. You can see
more signs pouring into the domed
circle, some of them brutally
knocking the pro-lifers out of the
forefront. It’s as if all the Carter
people got off the same bus, the
place comes alive so suddenly.

“Well ah’m stuck in Folsom
Prison, and time keeps draggin
on," the old miner sings, and when
he starts into a version of the
Beatles tune “Boys,” it's about
time to leave.

Nellie King, of all people, hops
onto the stage to emcee, and if ever
there was a time in his career when
he could stop being apolitical it was
now, not only signing the praises of
Carter, but going whole hog and
saying he backed George McGov-
ern four years ago. How would that
have played in Lawrenceville
during the seventh inning stretch
with the Bucs down 4-3?

King is garbling something
about Steelers-for-Carter, introduc-
ing Dwight White, Mel Blount,
Ernie Holmes and two others.
They look like nothing without
those numbers.

I work my way around the front
again, this time showing my
armed-to-the-hilt G-man friend the
appropriate tag. He lets me sift by
and soon I'm against the wooden
barricade, a man’s length from the
rostrum. Everyone's tagged with
one distinction or another, as the
networks come marching through
to set up their cameras on a
platform behind the rest of the
press. the media area is now
jammed, the networks forging
ahead with their heavy equipment
like Marines at Normandy.

“Hell, Iwish I’d been born thirty
years earlier," says one reporter
from a small local daily, being
jostled by the network onslaught.
“Next' November, man, and I’m
out. Thirty years, that's enough for
me."

The light intensiﬁes, there's a
crowd moving behind the platform.

In a second, Carter and Mondale
are on stage. The small. crowd
thunders beneath the reverbera-

ting dome, the ﬂashbulbs snap,
and there is electricity in the media
section.

“Hey, mack, lemme get a
camera through there," a hyper
newsman says cracking my shoul-
der.

“Sit on it, buddy, I’ve been here
since eight o'clock. Where were
you?" There goes that job with
CBS. I'm straddling one of the
barricade's legs; they'll have to rip
me off.

Throughout the speech-making,
cameramen toss their ﬁlm. packets
back to messengers. “This is the
best stuff, Charlie,” says the man
from Associated Press, tossing up a
‘bulging manila envelope, “and this
is the other stuff.”

Someone from ABC hands a
white mesh sack containing cani-
sters to a secret service man who
relays it to an ABC messenger.

The ﬁreworks go off on the hill.

behind the rostrum, green and
orange glimmers of “Carter-
Mondale," and the newsmen are
once again exuberating to get yet
another photo. “l'll bet the secret
service loved that," a reporter
says. the booms and bangs going
off a good ﬁve minutes.

A quarter of an hour more and
it's an aftermath. Stragglers mill
around to give each other ﬁnal
assessments. Carter is crossing a
bridge over the Monongahela
River, on his way to the County
Airport, and Mondale ‘is in a
jammed elevator on the way up to
his room at the William Penn.

Some sirens wail in front of the
main branch of the post ofﬁce,
paddy wagons pull up, and the
traffic stops. A beat policeman
taps the sidewalk crowd on-the tush
with his nightstick, “All right let's
move along," he says, everyone
looking back at the incident to see if
anyone famous is lying on the
ground. '

buck stoppedwith him. And so
too, the buck will stop with me.”
Carter stressed the neccessity of

a balanced budget and promised to
alter the inequities in the present
income tax system. He criticized
the system that allows upper
income levels to avoid tax payment.
Carter urged the crowd to vote for
“Yourselves. Vote for a fair tax
system, for a balanced budget, for
low crime. You help us get elected

and we'll help you,” Carter
concluded.

Everybody is Right

Every oncein a while, there occurs a debate or controversy where

everybody just happens to be right.

Recently, we received inquiries from full-time School of General
Studies (SGS) students who complained that they weren’t eligible for
the Student Health Service program but that part-time students, both

day and night, were.

We knew that the SGS cabinet had asked to be excluded from the
mandatory $16 health fee. Unlike their daylight counterparts, the SGS
cabinet tried to ﬁnd out whether night students wanted the service by
taking a survey. Results showed SGS students were largely opposed to
paying the health fee since most of them were already covered by the
health insurance plans of the companies that employed them during

' the day.

Part-time students, even though they seem more likely to be covered
by some non-University health insurance program, were given the
option of buying into the student health program because they were not
covered by the agreement between the SGS cabinet and the

administration;

The insurance company, which underwrites the health fee program,
. refused to give full-time SGS students the option of paying the health
fee because they ﬁgured, rightly, that only those who needed the
policy, and who would use it more often, would join the program
Part-time students, because of the small number who would opt for the
health fee, were allowed to retain their option. The insurance
company’s point is understandable in that they can’t be expected to
sell insurance to a group from whom they could be sure to take a loss,
and who would put burden on the whole system. ’
The administration, in worldng out the agreement with the insurance
company, did exactly as the SGS desired. ,

So here is a case where everybody behaved ina fair and logical

Schorr Abused

BY CASEY BAER

For the past week, the House
Ethics Committee has heard
testimony to determine whether
23-year veteran CBS news reporter
Daniel Schorr should be held in
contempt of Congress for his
admitted role in giving The Village
Voice, an ultra-liberal New York
newspaper, parts of a secret House
committee report on abuses within
U.S. Intelligence Agencies.
Schorr, who has been suspended
with payfrorn his CBS position, has
repeatedly refused to name the
source of his information during
interrogation, 'claiming that the
First Ammendment protects the
conﬁdentiality of his source.

Regardless of whether or not
Schorr is cited for contempt, and
indications are now thathe will not
be, a massive abuse of power has
surfaced in the Schorr affair, and
ironically -enough it is Schorr
himself, and not Congress, who is
being transgressed upon.

By issuing a subpoena to Schorr,
the House Ethics Committee has
indeed stepped out of line. The
power of Congress is immense, and
there is virtually no authority other
than the press capable of checking
that power by bringing to light the
many “errors of judgment” reg-
ularly occurring on Capitol Hill.

In calling Schorr to testify, and
threatening him with a ﬁne of up to
$1,000 and/or a prison term, the
Ethics Committee is obviously
attempting to exercise control over
press coverage of congress. The
paradox is, of course, that Schorr

received his “secret" information
from a source who was most
probably from within Congress
itself.

Few Americans can deny the
importance of secrets to the
national defense. But more of a
threat to the sanctity of such
secrets than the press, however,
are indiscreet Congressional com-
mittees which attempt to cover up
evidence of either their own errors
or those of other government
agencies by giving them secret
defense classiﬁcation.

If former President Nixon could
have ﬁned and imprisoned all of
the reporters who violated the
codes of “secrecy” imposed by his
administration, two things appear
likely: ﬁrst, Washington prisons
would by full of news reporters;
and second, Nixon would still be
president of a nation which had
never heard of a Washington hotel
named Watergate.

Daniel Schorr's situation, or
“Daniel in the Lion’s Den" as it
was called by Newsweek magazine,
strikes at an issue which the
American people should begin to
scrutinize. Two years ago the
nation painfully watched a presi-

There was some talk a few years back of doing
something to the Student Union. It is too old, too
deteriorated and too small to house the sorts of
student activities a campus this size needs.

Now there is talk of doing something with the
people who work in the Student Union.. Notthing A
ofﬁcial, really, just whispers behind closed doors
about “dead wood’-’ and “chopping blocks.”

K A . . . . . . . . » - . - y v - wt

BEHIND THE LINES

Even though college students are ostensibly
adults, and capable of handling themselves, there
are a few older adults working in the Student
Activities office who are responsible for helping

students handle their activities.

They are dually responsible for overseeing the
ﬁnancial activities of student groups, advising them
on operations and helping begin new programs.

If you find yourself tired of the same old
routines—nothing on Monday, speakers on Tuesday,
comedians or magicians on Wednesday, foreign ﬁlms
on Thursday, SUB ﬁlms on Friday and Pangborn
ﬁlms on Saturday—they' are partly to blame.

Whether the “chopping block” is really being
readied, as some have intimated, or not, the fact is
that there is little new is the student activities area.

Things have been going along at a pretty steady
pace, with still no headway being made into the lack
of programs for commuters, entertainment for those
tired of movies and progress for stagnated student

groups.

Not that to say students are doing such a hot job
themselves. They aren’t. But neither are they paid

for it, in most cases.

There is no money of course, for anything these
days. But some innovative things could be done with
the money now available. And the complaints aren't
just students griping about not having enough fun,
because educational programs are perhaps needed

most.

And if not more‘ fun, or more education for our
money, we ask at least for something different..
Students have often been called ingrates. Gimme,
gimme, gimme!‘ That’s all they ever say. Perhaps,
A but when you are paying all this money for college,
you can’t afford first-run movies, DiCesare-Engler
concerts, or a night at the Holiday House. And to
make matters worse, the state legislature won't let us

_ All Big Boys
Now Aren't Wet

I am writing this letter in
response to Dave McDonald’s
letter “Why Fraternities?” Dave’s
letter would lead us to believe that
he knew all that there was to know
about fraternity life. According to
him, it could have all been summed
up in one word, DRINKING! I
would like to comment on the
extensive research you must have
done to arrive at your conclusions.
Such objective fact ﬁnding could
only be characteristic of a lynch
mob.

Contrary to your beliefs, frater-
nity life does center around a little
more than the tap system. It might
interest you to know that last year,
Pitt's fraternities and sororities
raised over $13,000 for charity and
collected 895 pints of blood for the
Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh.

four of six student government

point out that Pitt’s Man of the

fraternity man but to a former
InterFraternity Council president.

Yes Dave, we do have occasional
parties with bands and we do have
tap beer at these parties. After all,
we are social organizations and we
do believe that social interaction of
this type does foster friendship.
Ah, friendship, now maybe we’re
getting closer to the answer.

BY GEORGE DULL

I have never been a joiner.
During my lifetime I have never felt
any sort of social deficiency or
dominant stress strong enough to
send me scurrying and scampering
for membership blanks or promi-
ses, pledges, vows or oathes to
make or take. However, I did, once
upon a time, take baptismal vows
and even once pledged allegiance
to the flag of the U.S.

It isn't that I’m against solidari-
ty, Durkheimian or any other kind,
now or ever, so long as it’s
reasonable and I don’t have to don

a foolish costume or use an equally‘

foolish nomenclature or get my
bare ass beat black and blue—to
preserve a semblance to solidarity,
of any ilk.

I grew up in a small Westmore-
land County town where everybody

belonged to this lodge or that

lodge, a municipal hodge-podge,

I and they had a_lot of solidarity,
mostly between the ears. I

feast on shamrocks! I love ’eml),
the Militant Socialist Party, the
Zengakuren, the Black Dragon
Society, the American Legion of
Patriots, the Friends of John
Wilkes Booth, and the loyal Sons
of Abraham Lincoln. Hold on—I
once joined the YMCA—so I could
take a bath now and then.

I once belonged to the AFL-CIO,
too. I joined after their goons
threatened to tear my arms off.
This had something to do with a
closed-shop idea. Solidarity—of
sorts.

For years I belonged to the
Democrat Party where I found
solidarity—of sorts. After Water-
gate, and the downfall of my 1972

, candidate of choice, Richard Nixon,

I decided it was time to say
“Sayonara” to the Democrats.

Watergate was their fault! If they
hadn’t had an ofﬁce in the complex
the Republican sneaks would never
havefound it without a map, a
compass and the grid coordinates
't_h_ereof. As it was, they simply

%b.o

smelled it out! Had the Dems
picked a candidate who could have
been supported by 50% of the
party, Nixon would not now be
languishing in that West Coast
penal institution called San Cle-
mented, the Casa Paciﬁca. He
would still, perish the thought, be
running.

I'm convinced now that politics
and logic are alien concepts—at
least to each other. Bertrand
Russell once remarked, “The
worse your logic, the more
interesting the results.” How true.

If politicians ever start using the
scientific method—woe be unto us!
No matter that certain people, who
shall remain nameless here,
excoriate and denounce the Ameri-
can policy—they will never be able
to decry the American political
process as uninteresting.

It has become so fascinating a
process that I’m just sitting around
now to see how the anticipated
34% of the electorate will decide
things in November. After that I’ll
continue to sit around listening to
the 66% gripe about the way things
should have been or ought to be.
The idea that they, the self-sancti-
ﬁed, the self-disenfranchised, the
self-enlightened, might be respon-
sible for a significant, undesirable

change in American governance
will never occur to these asses.

Some ofthis erudite account may
explain why the antinomian I got
out of a major political party. Let's
just say I blame it all on the
Democrats. Everything is their
fault. Even peanut butter!

I now carry around a political
identiﬁcation card marked “Inde-
pendent." It ﬁts the myth and the
illusion that I belong and am
independent. As long as that lie
can survive, I'll survive. But even
now, Lester Maddox is ideologi-
cally raping that group called
Independent with his schizoid
shenigans. .

The more I think about it, the
more Ithink I will follow the lead of
the Socialist Labor candidates,
Levin and Blomen, and conduct a
write-in campaign with myself this
November. I’m going to write in
my name for all the jobs, beginning
with the Presidency of the U.S.

So let all non-voters—the unre-
gistered, the disenfranchised, take
heart from this. Let ’em get
registered; they have undreamed-
of hope! If they want, as they
claim they do, a candidate they can
trust, love, honor and obey, then
let each of them write in his or her
own name on the ballot.

Some Middle Earth Magic

BY MATT KAMBIC

‘Early autumn is full of its own
kind of magic. Leaves swirling
along the ground, swept along by
September’s wind, nature priming
itself for the winter to come, people
sensing the change in season and
the approaching twilight of another
year. For the more imaginative
among us, late September brings
with it a strange stirring. Some
event, long ago, took place in this»
part of autumn. Some magical
happening which prefaced one of
the greatest quests of all time.
Some of us know the date.

September 22. Bag End was full
of activity. The year of the Shire,
S-R 3001, Frodo and Bilbo Baggins’
birthdays. The long-expected
party had ﬁnally arrived. We
celebrate it again today.

The phenomena of the late
J .R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings
trilogy is capturing more readers
with each reprinting (it is now, as
of October 75, in its 54th printing).
But Gandalf’s eyebrows would
bristle with rage were he to see the
commercialization which has
caught up with the saga of the One
Ring. There are maps, posters,
calendars, critiques galore ‘and

' were no showers in camp), or

seeing a movie in Steubenville,
Ohio. We had some good guitar‘
and banjo pickers in the group, so
many a chill night was spent
singing songs around the campfire.

Avella is about 35 miles
southwest of Pittsburgh and;
sometimes we got a ride into the‘
city. As far as other entertainment:
goes, all I'll say is that there's a
friendly local bar in Avella called
“'lou’s”.

Summer session began in the
third week of June and a second
camp was established on the other
side of Avella, closer to Pittsburgh.

This camp covered operations in
the Indian village site, Farfutia, the
running of test crews’ and some of
the personnel at the Indian mound
right in Avella. ,

Volunteers were moved around
all summer from the new camp,
various test sites, and Meadow-
Croft's main burial mound. The
close space and cramped digging
style of the rockshelter was quite a
change from the open field styles of
the Farfutia village.

The federal government awarded
Meadowcroft a contract this year to
test 13 previously surveyed sites
for any additional archaeological
significance. In a year, the entire
new camp-village-testing area will
be covered by the waters of a new
dam.

Sometimeswhen the day was
almost over we would sit and
marvel at the area’s beauty. It was
hard to imagine that it would all be
under water soon.

other fantasies which mimic the
Tolkien trilogy (and the plugs on
the jackets never fail to mention
some comparison). There are
pewter chessmen with Gandalf and
Aragorn leading the good forces
against the Captain of the Black
Riders and Saruman the Wizard.
Orcs and Hobbits are the pawns.

The next step is certainly
logical—a movie. Tolkien’s trilogy
will reach the screen as an
animated feature by Ralph Bakshi,
the same fellow who did “Fritz the
Cat.” Hopefully, Bakshi will
improve his technique before
attempting to put into picture what
took Professor Tolkien over 13
years (1936-1949)‘to put into words.

There are games marketed which
duplicate the forces of some of the
trilogy's more important battles.
War-games freaks purchase hun-
dreds of miniature ﬁgures from
middle earth and then play out
these wars down to the last
wizard-bolt.

T-shirts and jewelry from the
trilogy are also available. Indeed,
you can buy the ring itself,
complete with the famous inscrip-
tion done in Elf-rune: “One Ring
to rule them all.”

there is an excellent, but very rare,
album ﬂoating around done by a
Swedish musician, Bo Hansson.
Hansson rented a cottage in the
woods, took an eight-track along
and some extra musicians and
created somevery hobbit-like, very
other-worldly sounds. If you like
Tolkien, and you ever see this
album “Music Inspired by the Lord
of the Rings,” buy it.

But beyond allthe commerciali-
zation remains the classic master-

Mount Doom is unraveled in a
literary style that other authors
have yet to match. Indeed, it is
Professor Tolkien’s mastery of
language which propels us into
middle earth so effectively. The
story itself is powerful, and the
background of history and setting
from which it springs so complete
that one cannot doubt Middle Earth
did indeed exist.

Yet what does one do who after
re-reading the story for the tenth
time, longs for moreelves, dwarfs
and Hobbits. Well, there is a
sequel waiting somewhere in the
wings. Many rumors circulate

Pitt Ombudsman Offers Aid  

BY SUSAN SKLAR

What, you ask, is an ombuds-
man? A great many Pitt students
do not know what an ombudsman
does, and a signiﬁcant number are
unaware that Pitt even employs
one.

The ofﬁce of the ombudsman is

' located in G-21 of the Cathedral of

Learning, to make it a little less
mysterious. The position was
created three years ago by current
ombudsman Leland Deck and
Eugene Richardson, "who was then
assistant vice chancellor of busi-
ness and ﬁnance. ‘His task was to
handle the ﬁnancial hassles stu-
dents have with the University.

Before this time, students with
complaints concerning registration,
invoices or student aid wandered
from ofﬁce to ofﬁce looking for
help. i

Deck, who is retiring soon, will
be replaced by Julius Ray. Ray will
hold the dual title of ombudsman
and director of student business
services.

Ray is a large, amiable man who
is eager to help students unravel
bureaucratic tangles.

“My function is to listen and to
respond; to try and mediate and
achieve a result,” Ray said. “The
ombudsman listens to the student
tell his side of the story, listens to
the department’s side and makes a

   

unravel ' bureaucratic tangles.

.Iulius Ray, new University ombudsman, is eager to help students
He cannot promise students any

miracles, but guarantees a 100% effort on their behalf.

recommendation based on the

facts.”

The ombudsman has-no power to
waive any fees or ﬁnes assesed by
the University. He is a liaison
between the student and the
University, according to Ray,
having only the power to influence
decisions in varying degrees.

“The ombudsman is in the
unique position of being able to cut
across University lines," Ray said.

Ray is seeking to educate Pitt
students about the ombudsman’s

ofﬁce by “meeting with everyone

from ‘the student to the vice ~
He plans to sit in on ,

V9

chancellor.
Student Affairs Advisory Commit-
tee meetings and recommend
changes to the university from
mistakes and discrepancies in
University policy that are brought
to his attention.

The ombudsman’s office is

largely dependent upon student’

imput, Ray said.
“I do not promise that a student
who comes to my ofﬁce will get

~l00% of what he wants," Ray said,

“but I guarantee that he or she will
get 100 %of my effort."

Ray graduated from the Univer-
sity of Detroit with a degree in
business administration. He has
worked for three of the “big four"
auto plants handling systems
analysis, credit and consumer
problem solving. His specialty,
however, is public relations, Ray
said.

Ray moved to Pittsburgh seven
weeks ago, and, although he has
had limited contact with Pitt
students, he said he's found them
so far to be “honest, hard working,
but troubled. I went through the
same things and I don’t want
students to overlook the beauty of
the academic experience, because
they are frustrated by the
impersonal aspects of University
life," Ray said.

TAX SYSTEM UNFAIR

HARRISBURG (AP)——A Sen-
ate committee said yesterday the
present property tax system is
almost totally unfair and needs
state regulation.

The Senate Finance Committee
recommended that the powers of
the state Tax Equalization Board be
increased to review county assess-
ments, regulate assessing ﬁrms
and help train county assessors.

our function is to act as a training
clinic, we have to tape all of the
sessions so we can evaluate the
effectiveness of the graduate

After the faculty supervisor sees

to ask them to go somewhere

Sexuality

Deﬁning one’s sexuality involves
integrating factors such as one’s
religion, politics, world view and

personal relationships, according-

to Felice Newman of the University
Women’s Center. '

To facilitate this integration for
women, the center is sponsoring a
seminar on Women’s sexuality
entitled, “Process of Integration”
beginning Sunday. Newman, a
senior writing major with a minor
in Women’s Studies will teach the
course.

The course, according to New-

man, will explore sexual orienta-
tion, self-images, personal histo-
ries, loneliness and aging.
“Women have always been
deﬁned by men in  of men,
and are just beginning to deﬁne
them-selves, ’ ’ Newman said.
Newman designed the course

, which will consist of discussion and

group exercises. The participants
will study works such as New
Women’s Survival Catalogue, Get-
ting Clear, and Amazon Quarterly.
Discussions, Newman said, will be
deﬁned by course members. V

In some ways, according to
Newman, the course will be a
research class, covering political
problems, sexual taboos and
biological questions.

“I'd be really happy if everyone
in the course wasn't under 2S,”
Newman said.

The non-credit seminar will meet
at 603 Bruce Hall, and run for eight
two-hour sessions.

VIETNAM
WORLD BANK MEMBER
WASHINGTON (AP)—Com-

munist Vietnam won membership
in the World Bank over U.S.
opposition yesterday, giving it the
potential of qualifying for con-
siderable amounts of ﬁnancial aid.

The 127-nation bank each year
dispenses billions in loans, much of
it interest-free, to help ﬁnance
development projects in member
nations.

Last week Hanoi won members-
ship in the International Monetary
Fund. which also is a source of
considerable financial help for its
members.

U.S. officials said the United
States, which contributes heavily to
both institutions, was alone in its
opposition to Hanoi when the
World’s Bank executive directors
met behind closed doors.

The Dig I Sifted Through

BY PAMELA EUSI

When I tell someone that my
major at Pitt is archaeology, I hear
one of several answers: (1) Gee,
that’s interesting.
like to dig in the dirt, huh? (3) I
wish I could study dinosaurs too.
(4) I've always wanted to go on one
of those excavations. (Archaeolo-
gists call them digs.)

Well, I always wanted to go on
one too, and this summer I ﬁnally
got my chance. I participated in
the excavations at and associated
with the Meadowcroft archeo-
logical project in Avella, Pa.

I arrived at camp at the

. Meadowcroft rock shelter on

Memorial Day and was promptly

of sifting dirt through mesh
screens. This must be done in order
to insure that no artifacts are

Novices are put to work on the

ARTS

Afsfephen Foster

Mennen:

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The University’s Mainstage
Theatre season begins this week-
end with the revival of When You

’ Comin’ Back Red Ryder?, with the

spring season cast intact.

Dick Mennen of Pitt’s theatre
department talked about some
aspects of the award-winning
off-Broadway hit.

Question: Could you give a
sketch of the history of this
particular play? _

Mennen: Sure, it was written by
a man named Mark Medoff, a
teacher at the University of New
Mexico, and though it isn’t his first
play, it is the first piece that’s been
produced.

It was done off off Broadway in
1973 and was picked up by a

. director for off Broadway where it

got good reviews and awards. 1 got
familiar with the play because a
friend of mine was playing the role

of Ted, the dope dealer who holds '

the other characters hostage.

Q: What is the play trying to get
across?

A:, Well, the play is set in the
late 6, Os in a diner of a small New
Mexico town. You have the people

who live in the town and the’

outsiders who wander in here from
the road.
There’s a dope-dealer, Ted, who

is running some stuff to California
He

and his vehicle breaks down.
needs money to get into San Diego,

» 3 he holds the people in the diiier
hostage and tries to set them up to
get what he needs. In this crucible

The Heroless Plan

of his own needs, he brings out the
needs of the other people.

Q: The ‘play deals with
disillusionment. Why is it set in
the West?

A: Well, it’s not strictly a story
about the .West. lt’s set in the
West because the West, and the
Wild West, meant innocense,
heroism and it held the future of
the country. Things were black and
white in those days; ‘good and evil.

Q: Who's Red Ryder and where
does he ﬁt: into this crucible idea
you mentioned earlier?

Mennen: Well, Red Ryder is
actually two people. First of all

he’s a comic strip character, one of j

the more popular characters back
in the 40s. And Red Ryder is also
the tough punk who works the
night shift at the diner and gets
trapped with the others when Ted
walks in. I

The point of the comic strip

‘character is made by the dope-

runner; that there once was a time
when there were heroes like Red
Ryder, the Lone Ranger and Tom
Mix, all of these Western comic
strip heroes.

But now, he points out,’ all we're
left with is this new Red Ryder, a
greasy kid with his hair slicked
back. There’s a disparity between
the myth and the fantasy of the
American West and what reality is
today.

Q: The play is set in the late
60"s. With the muffled tone of the
70’s, do you think there are

problems in translating the mes-
sage for audiences today?
Mennen: No. When you look at

it, it’s really a play of the 70s. A
retrospective look at the aftermath
of the hope and energy of the 60s.
lt’s a timely message because
we’re still livingwith the Vietnam
War in our consciousness. The
disillusionment of the play is here
today as well—America trying to
face itself after the war and after
Watergate. I think we’re still
trying to grasp on a deeper level
the changes that came about
because of those events.

Q: What sort of role does the
violence of the dope dealer play?

Mennen: It’s not the violence
actually. The violence is the
framework in which the action
takes place. ‘Actually the catalyst
in the play is the dope dealer’s
brutal honesty and cynicism which
forces the other hostages to face
themselves in the diner.

Q: It seems as if every art form
in this country, in poetry, cinema,
music and theater, people are
trying to digest the whole Vietnam
experience. How does Red Ryder
fit into this genre? A

Mennen: Well, the experience
was recent, so there's not a big
problem with translation. I think
the writer has a vision of the events
that is his own. Ten years from
now our perception of the war may
change and that might cause
problems. But for now, it's the
right message, I feel.

The Acting, Directing, Magical Bixby  

BY NANCY J. WINTNER

Bright lights, cameras, photo-
graphers and crew members
simulated a Hollywood scene. ' In
the center of the set stood the star
of the show preparing ‘for the
taping. He was quite serious,
concentrating of his lines and
practicing each stage movement
until it was perfect.

“Teleprompter set?” he
shouted.
“Ready!” a crew member

. answered.

Ten seconds...ﬁve seconds...and
silence: The tape was rolling.

A few minutes later the scene
was ﬁnished. As the celebrity
walked off the set and moved
closer, he appeared much thinner
in person than he did on TV. Yet
you could still recognize this
familiar personality.

He was actor Bill Bixby and the
setting was WQED studios.

As host of WQED’s Once Upon a
Classic children's series premier-
ing Oct. 9 on the Public Broadcast

. System, Bixby recently spent ﬁve

and a half days of taping
introductions and closings to the
programs at the Pittsburgh station.

It wasn’t Bixby’s first visit to the
Pittsburgh studio. Last April ‘he,

along with actress Julie Andrews,
cohosted WQED’s national pro-
duction, The Puzzle Children”, a
special program on children’s
leaarning disabilities set to air Oct.
19.

Following one day of taping and
reshooting, we met in the
beautiful, plush living room in the
WQED president’s executive suite.

Bixby visited the Pitt campus on
his last trip to Pittsburgh. When
asked what advice he had given

students interested in the enter- '

tainment ﬁeld, Bixby immediately
said, “Don’t major in drama!”
Students should not limit their
education, he said, but rather take
a variety of ,courses--a general
curriculum.

Variety has certainly been a part
of Bixby’s career. Pittsburgh
claims the honor of extending him
his first “paying” job.

Using the city's Golden Triangle
as the background for a TV

commercial, Bixby and a young
'woman were “The ’plymouth

Couple” for an advertisement
televised throughout Pennsylvania.
Following this taping, he said, the
two traveled the Pennsylvania
Amish country where hex signs and
barns were the setting for another
similar statewide commercial.

Bill Bixby hosting the WQED

presentation Once Upon A Classic.

Many of us remember Bixby for
his leading roles in My Favorite
Martian, The Magician, and The
Courtship of Eddie’s Father. Bixby
frequently mentioned the latter
program.

Does he still keep in touch with
Eddie--alias Brandon Cruz? A big
smile ﬂashed across his face.

“Yes. We have been close ever
since the beginning of The

Courtship” Bixby said. Knowing
that Brandon came from a difﬁcult
family background, he immediately
took a personal interest in the boy.
“Currently, 14-year-old Cruz
resides with his grandfather in
California, but anytime he wants to
visit me, he just phones and comes
over. Ihave an empty room at the
beach house and Cruz is always
welcomed to stay,” he added.

Often because of Bixby’s close-
ness with the boy and his role
portrayed in The Courtship of
Eddie’s Father people see him as
the boy's «father.

Bixby said he would love to
continue the series following
Eddie” through his teenage years
and through‘the inevitable separa-
tion of parent and young man. It's
very difﬁcult, he said, for parents
to separate themselves from their
children, “releasing them from any
obligations—-truly giving them their
freedom."

It's something I'd like to explore
as an actor. I think I’d have great
personal involvement for the
subject matter."

There are many disadvantages to
being an actor, Bixby said. At
times you’re abused, stepped on
and treated as if you weren’t a

the average person.

human being--it can be very
irritating, he added.

Even from an economic point of ,
view, actors aren't respected like
“When you
start out as an actor," he said,
“you can't get a credit card,
telephone--you can't get anything.
Then after you make it, everyone
doubles the ‘price because they
ﬁgure you've really got it made.
People don’t understand our
business and the nature of it--that’s
the unfair part of it.”

Because Bixby has worked as an
actor for years, it is surprising that
his real interest lies in directing. In
the past 5 years, Bixby directed
The Courtship of Eddie’s Father,
Mannix,Kate McShane,Room 222,
and Bridget Loves Bernie.
Currently his directing projects
include Rich Man, Poor Man and
The Spencers pilots.

After working on both sides of
the fence, Bixby prefers directing
and wants to pursue this line of
work rather than acting which he
terms “boring."

If a really sﬁper role comes up

that I'd like to play," he said,

“that's the privilege I have. If not,
I'm just going to direct because

there s so much to know and TV is‘

such a challenge."

Another facet of Bixby’s multi-
dimentional career is his ma.gician
role in The Magician series. At the
beginning of that series, Bixby
made the camera crew promise
there would be no camera tricks.
Otherwise, he would quit the show.

‘‘I’m tired of learning these
tricks and going through all the
trouble of doing real magic and
then they want to use camera cuts.
You're either going to be honest
with the public or you’re not.
Audiences today are too sophis-
ticated.

“Anytime the magic trick begins
there is never ever a camera cut
from any angle. That’s done so you
know the magic is being performed
in front of you. That’s the part that
made the show intrigueing.”

Although the program only
lasted for a year, reruns were
shown not only in the U.S., but in
foreign countries as well. “And
it’s number one in every foreign
country,” he added. “It’s even
more popular than the Courtship of
Eddie’s Father.

rushing record now owned by
Archie Grifﬁn and the loss of a

one just as talented, Coach Johnny

way things are going as he related
to a gathering of reporters at the
weekly media luncheon.

“We’re not satisfied yet,”.

Majors said, “and we’re not
patting each other on the backs
either, because we realize we still

After polishing off two tough
opponents in succession, the
Panthers are preparing for Satur-
day's home opener with Temple,

last seven games dating back to the
middle of last season. Everything
seems to be going ﬁne for the Cats,
except for the quarterbacking
problem sparked by the loss of
Robert Haygood with a knee injury
in the second quarter of Saturday’s
battle with Georgia Tech.

“It was a serious blow to us,’
Major's said. “For this year
primarily, because it gave us no

The Pitt golf team opened its

match excuses. “The weather was
threatening, but the course was

decent," he said. “Excuses are
something of the past.”

Six men from each team
participated in the match, but
according to the scoring system
only the top ﬁve scores were
tabulated. No Panther broke 80.

Petro said his squad “just
couldn’t get it going” in a match
which was an “ideal opportunity”

. to show the team’s potential. ‘

He admitted his players are a
much better team than they
showed Monday and promised they
would “get considerably better.”

The teams is now preparing for
this Friday's Tournament.

But Majors was not distressed

‘and believes the season can go on

as planned despite the loss of
Haygood. The fourth year coach
also said Cavanaugh is ready to ﬁll
in and run the veer offense with no
changes, perhaps only a little more
passing than before.

“I don’t plan to change the
offense at all,” Majors said.
“We're going to leave the offense
like it is. I think Cavanaugh can
help the passing game and he can
also handle the option very well.”

One of the featured players on
hand for the affair, Cavanaugh, a
junior from Youngstown, was
asked if he thought much about
himself also suffering an injury,
thus putting the quarterbacking
position and the outcome of the
season in turmoil.

“I’m not thinking about that,”
Cavanaugh said. “If you think
about getting hurt, that's when
something is going to happen.”

Majors, who was joined by his
offensive coordinator and offensive
line coach Joe Avezzano, said
prayerfully that the Panthers
"hope our offensive line does their
job" in the way of protection for the
team’s last remaining experienced
quarterback.

So far, the offensive line of
center John Pelusi, guards Tom
Brzoza and Matt Carroll, and
tackles John Hanhauser, Joe Stone
and George Messich have done a
ﬁne job in springing Dorsett free
and offering protection on passing
plays.

“We’re pleased with their
progress,” Avezzano said.
“We’ve never had an entire group
of linemen back before. That’s
pretty uncommon in college foot-
ball. lt’s an extremely loose and

confident group. ’ ’

Pelusi. the other guest player,
was praised by Avezzano for his
talent. leadership, unselﬁshness

and also his sense of humor.

“As hard as the linemen work,”
Avezzano said, “Pelusi manages to
keep a good sense of humor which‘
keeps the guys loose." Pelusi, by
the way, will be blocking the Owls’
nose guard Joe Klecko, who is an

all-American _c_andidate.

Avezzano, who said fullback
Elliott Walker will be playing close
to 100% on Saturday, expressed
thanks the season did not go down
the drain because of Haygood’s
injury.

“We're just super happy we
have someone like Matt Cavanaugh
to step in and do the job for us,” he
said. “Matt has shown he can start
and come off the bench and that he
can run and he can throw.”

‘_‘Like Coach Majors said, we’re

The Jury Is Out: Beware Possers

BY KAREN KADILAK

Every summer, it never fails.

Young football players pack their
bags for Johnny Majors’ annual
summer football camp at Pitt
Stadium.

The high school lads hope to do
something more signiﬁcant than
just have fun, polish their football
techniques and come in contact
with some of the best coaching

V methods in the country.

Most of their aids_ are centered
around catching the eye of Majors
by showing off whatever football
talents they have—maybe they’ll
have that certain something only a
trained football eye such as Majors’
can detect.

As is often the case, most go
away disappointed. All they have
are memories and some new tricks

7 they can add to the gridiron

repertoire.

Some, on the other hand, come
away with more than memories,
the tee shirts and memorabilia they
get at the camp. Thoseselect
few—-among them present-day
Panthers Gordon Jones, Dave
Logan andJim Triscilia—come

away with an offer to play big time
college football for Pitt.

Pitt defensive back Bob Jury also
was one of those select few.

Two years ago by the end of
camp, Majors was so impressed
with J ury’s skills that the South

Park high» school graduate left
camp with a Pitt football scholar-
ship. To say Jury jumped at the
chance would be an understate-
ment. Not having been contacted
by any other school, it was» indeed a
dream come true for the 6-0,
186-pound Jury.

What did he do in that summer
camp to earn a chance to play for
the Panthers after he was passed
up by the college recruiters?

“I was just at the right place at
the right time,” Jury said. “I can’t

‘ remember doing anything special. I

guess I just showed solid funda-
mentals on defense.”

Solid fundamentals and a 4.6 in
the 40-yard dash sidn’t hinder his
chances either.

Why, then, didn’t the college
recruiters detect something spec-
ial, as Majors obviously did, and
give him an offer before that
summer of ’74? The answer is that

Pitt’s cross-country team suffer-
ed a small setback last weekend
after ﬁnishing second at ‘the
California State Invitational.‘

The Panthers ﬁnished a close
second with 54 points, behind team

College which obtained 41 points.
Indiana, just edged out by Pitt,
ﬁnished third with 57 points.

Pitt’s team wasn’t denied all the
spotlight though, thanks to a
superb race turned in by junior

BY MARK MURPHY

According to Pitt soccer coach
Leo Bemis, a lot of good came out
of his team’s 1-1 tie with the
University College of Cork (Ireland)
Monday night.

Despite failing to win the Pitt
Stadium match-up, the long-time
mentor was happy with his team’s
play.

“The turf was wet and’ ball
control was difficult, but our fellas
did a good job,” Bemis said. “We
could have and should have scored
more goals, but everything consid-
ered, this was our best game to
date.”

Bemis took the game with Cork
in the light that it was meant to be
played, that being an exhibition
contest. Using all his players, the
Panther coach gave his regulars
some rest and his back-up men
some needed work.

~‘ ‘I substituted everyone, ’ ’ Bemis

explained. “We have a big game,

Friday night with Slippery Rock
and I wanted us ready.

“It was a team-type game. Two
.or three players who hadn't seen
much action lately got some time
in. Mark Gannon played in Tom
Murphy’s spot (Murphy is out with
a groin pull) and did a real good
job.”

“We also had some fellas

iworking in strange positions,"

Bemis continued. ‘ ‘But we

accomplished some things. If I had,

approached the game solely to win
it we conceivably could have.”

In describing the Cork style of
play, Bemis said, “They have good
ball control and move and pass

well: They did too much passingin .

Melvin Boyd. After the first mile,
Boyd lost the ﬁeld of runners and
soloed the course in 25 minutes and
13 seconds to establish a new
course record. This time shattered
the former record, which was held
by a runner from last year’s team,
Nick Martin, by seven seconds.
Boyd had mixed emotions after
his individual win Saturday. “I felt
I ran a pretty good race, but we
have a long season and I don’t want
to get burned out too early in the
year. Our team has a long three

  , Booters Tie Irish, l-l  

paydirt territory though. (Pitt
goalie) Frank Bucci made some
good saves on them.”

“Their goal came on a one~on-
one head goal situation,” Bemis
continued. “The Cork man got’ a
little up higher than our man. Our
goalie came out and it just got by
him.”

The Cork team now travels to
Ohio, then back through Pennsyl-
vania, before heading home to
Ireland. The only team able to
defeat the visitors so far was Penn
State, while Shippensburg, like
‘Pitt, played them to a stalemate.

   
   

Junior quarterback Matt Cavanaugh  get the call  the

weeks of practice before the next
meet at West Virginia. To improve
we will have to run in a tighter pack
with the leaders.”

Since Boyd's high school alma
mater was nearly Ringgold, run-
ning at California was like a
homecoming. “I always like
running at Cal State because of all
of the fans cheering me on.”

Boyd was also pushed a little by
second-place ﬁnisher Robin Hol-
land of ACC, who ﬁnished 12
seconds behind him. “I knew if I
let—up at all that Robin would be
right on my heels.” He didn’t ease
up, though, running the ﬁrst mile
in 4:56 and averaging 4:50 for the
last four.

The other team scorers for Pitt

included: 9th place, junior Nort

McDonald; 10th, sophomore Mark
Studnicki; 16th, junior Tom Herr-
mann; 18tl'1,Vfreshman Gary Siri-
.,ano, 21st, ‘senior Terry Wileiand

_23rd.' sophomore Ron Wirick.
Adding new excitement to. the *

meet, women,‘ eﬁmpeted in a
three-mile’ race which was run
simultaneously with the men’s.
Debbie Falck, a Pitt freshman from
North Hills, breezed the course in
18 minutes and 45 seconds to take
ﬁrst—place honors.

The Pitt women’s team ﬁnished
third with a ﬁne showing behind
two well-established teams from

i Slippery Rock and Bucknell.

South Park high school had the

dubious distinction of being a

school with an unimpressive

Such a situation occasionally

scoutaway, even if the player in
question happens to have the
credentials Jury collected—three-
year All Black Hills Conference
selection, two-time WPIAL All Star
selection, two-time Post-Gazette
All-Star pick and Coaches Guide
Magazine's Athlete of the Year.

It puzzles even the most astute
football observer.

Jury isn’t bitter, however. By no
stretch of the imagination. He’s
realized many of the goals of which
young football players like him only
dream.

After seeing special teams duty
extensively in his freshman season,
Jury ﬁnally earned a starting spot
at safety last season when‘ he led
the Panthers in interceptions with
three, collected 47 tackles and led
Pitt to its Sun Bowl win over
Kansas last winter by picking off an
errant pass.

If recent performances are any
indication, Jury this season should
become the defensive leader
Majors and defensive secondary
coach Joe Madden expect him to be
at cornerback.

_ Notre Dame——now

Jury gave a glimpse of the
season for which he seems destined
when he pulled down one pass and
battled down four others, which
had the earmark of touchdowns or
long gains stamped on them, in
Pitt’s opening win, at Notre Dame.

Matt Cavanaugh: Maior's
Key To Football Temple

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

Johnny Majors is one lucky fella.

There are not many coaches across the country who can afford to lose
a talented running quarterback, such as Robert Haygood, and still look
optimistically at the remainder of what could have been a long season.

Without some wise recruiting moves and a little luck from the Fates,

the Panthers could be in trouble. Instead they’re able to go on with the
season with Matt Cavanaugh at the helm and not lose one bit of
performance at the quarterback position.
 After Haygood was injured last year in Pitt’s 17-0 loss to Navy,
Cavanaugh, a junior from Youngstown, Ohio, started the next four
games and sparkled against a good Syracuse team, connecting on six of
nine passes, including an 80 yarder to Gordon Jones, for 167 yards and
three touchdowns in a 38-0 crusher.

Also directing the Panthers to their upset win over Notre Dame,
Cavanaugh finished his ﬁll-in performance - with very credible
statistics'—-completing 30 of 65 passes for 488 yards and seven
touchdowns.

But Coach Johnny Majors decided to go with a mended Haygood in
the Sun Bowl against Kansas last year and his choice paid off as Pitt
won and Haygood was selected the game's most valuable offensive
performer. Thus, Haygood had a slight edge going into spring drills,
though Majors maintained the two signal callers were so close it would
be hard to make a decision.

So before anyone panics, remember—the Panthers aren't losing
anything by going with Cavanaugh. In fact, opposing defenses may
now have to look more for the pass with Cavanaugh behind the center,
perhaps giving backs such as Tony Dorsett and Elliott Walker even
more running room.

Cavanaugh is a stronger thrower and a rugged runner, although his
ability to run the veer offense has at times been questioned. But
according to quarterback coach Bill Cox, “Cavanaugh is a ﬁne thrower
who can run better than people think.”

_ Majors expressed how lucky.hewas to have a “backup” quarterback
of Cavanaugh’s calib_er.But after Cavanaugh...well, Majors had better
hope nothing happens to his new quarterback because he may not be so
lucky in ﬁnding a suitable replacement should Cavanaugh also fall to
the injury’ jinx. .

“We’re very thin at quarterback,” Majors said. “Haygood and
Cavanaugh played our last 14 games, but behind them, we have very
little experience.” 4

What Majors does have are an inexperienced senior, Tom Yewcic,
and an inexperienced freshman, Wood Jackson, neither of whom
possess the abilities to step in right away and contribute to Pitt’s drive
to a national crown.

Perhapssome of the luck of the Irish rubbed off on Majors while the
Panthers were in South Bend two weeks ago. He won't lose a thing
with Cavanaugh running the attack, but after him...

Can anyone play quarterback out there? 6

SETTING FOR DEBATE
IS DIGNIFIED

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—'/f"
Workmen yesterday erected a
simple blue and white theatrical
setting designed to lend dignity,
with the l_east amount of distraction
to the first presidential- debate
since 1960.

“We created an environment,
that would enhance the debate and
present a neutral andcomfortable
environment for the political
candidates,” said Robert Weight-
man, the New York set designer
hired by the sponsoring League of
Women Voters.

Republican President Gerald
Ford and his Democratic chal-
lenger, Jimmy Carter, will share a
blue carpeted, foot-high oval
platform Thursday night on ' the
center of the Walnut Street Theater
stage for their 90-minute TV-and-
radio confrontation.

Their identical half-circle oak
podiums are waist high with a plain
ﬂat top for note-taking. Each will
have oak stools on which to sit or
lean against when not speaking.

MURDER TRIAL JURY
SELECTED
HACKENSACK‘-s N.J. (AP)-
A jury of six women and 10 men
was selected and sworn in Tuesday
inthe murder trial of Philadelphia
shoe repairman Joseph Kallinger.

The panel was chosen after more
than 150 prospective jurors had
been interviewed over a 5‘/2-day
period at the Bergen County
Courthouse by Superior Court
Judge Thomas Dalton.

Kallinger, 40, is on trial on
charges he murdered a young
practical nurse in January 1975 in
Leonia during a three-state robbery
and sex crime rampage.

Kallinger was barred from jury
selection when, on the first day of
the proceedings, he interrupted
Dalton with loud animal-like noises

Dalton had not decided yet when
opening statements would be made
or whether Kallinger would be able
to attend the trial. The use of a
closed-circuit television hookup
was under consideration.
