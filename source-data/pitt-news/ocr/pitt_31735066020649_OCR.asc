"  I am no longer certain that it is
honorable to stand by as the helpless
_witness of a cataclysm, with no other

' hope than to die innocently‘ and by

accident, as a non-participant. ”

Thomas Merton
from~ “Letter "to an Innocent
Bystander"

On Dec. 8, 1984, the United States
Navy will commission a new
nuclear-powered submarine to be
christened the U.S.S. Pittsburgh.
Both in Pittsburgh and at the
Groton, Conn. boatyard that day
there will be a number of protesters,
objecting to the submarine and its
weapons. Many of those dissenters
will be from the Thomas Merton
Center.

The Thomas Merton Center is an
entity not easily defined. The sign
across their storefront headquarters
at 5125 Penn Ave. in Garfield pro-
claims it to be “A Ministry for Jus-
tice and Peace.” Although not all the
workers at the center are driven by

._ religious beliefs, all are spurred by

of an exclusive interview.

deeply felt-convictions. The_ Merton
Center works toward achieving its
perception of social justice. That
perception includes working
towards the end of such issues as the
arms race, U._S. involvement in Cen-
tral America, world hunger and
South African apartheid.‘

A, name that has become syn-
onymous with the Merton Center is
Molly Rush, the director of the cen-
ter. Although now ecumenical, the
Thomas Merton Center \was
founded’ in 1972 as a Catholic organ-

ization by Rush ‘and Larry Kessler. -

“It started as a group of Catholics
called CEASE [Catholics for an End
to the Asian Slaughter and Exploi-
tation] to respond to the fact of
insufficient response within ‘the
Pittsburgh Diocese to the Vietnam
war," said Rush.

The group took the name of
Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk
and a prolific author of nearly 60
books,- many dealing with peace and
social issues. Merton was an early
supporter of the civil rights move-
ment and very outspoken in his con-
cern about , nuclear weapons
proliferation and the Vietnam war.

“The whole work of the Merton
Center is to empower the people,”
says Rush. “It’s not the politicians
that set the agenda but the people.

That’s our aim — to educate the pol- t

iticians as to‘ what they should be
doing. ‘

“We feel strongly that non-
violence, including civil disobe-
dience, is preferable to the violence
that is leading us to the total destruc-
tion of the world," said Rush, refer-
ring to the arms race.

Molly Rush is best known for her

,numerous acts of civil disobedience
which through the years have made
her a media figure. Rush has been
arrested so many times that when
she was scheduled to apear before
Judge Robert Dauer for a bail hear-.
ing last June, he was quoted as say-
ing, “Molly Rush, again? Where was
she -this time?”

Her most notorious act of civil
disobedience, and one for which she
spent 11 weeks in prison, was her

participation in what has become
known as the Plowshares‘ Eight
group. Besides ‘Rush, the group con-
sisted of Philip and Rev. Dan Berri-
gan, Anne Montgomery (a nun),
John Schuchardt (lawyer), Rev.
Carl Kabot (a priest), Elmer Maas (a
music and ‘philosophy professor),
and Dean Hammer (a Protestant
minister). The eight, taking the Bib-
lical passage about beating swords
into plowshares literallly, broke into
a General Electric missile cone plant

in King of Prussia, Pa. and beat a
Mark 12A missile cone with a ball
peen hammer and poured human
blood about the facility. For her
part, Rush was sentenced to 2-5
years in prison, but is currently free
due to an appeal to the Pennsylvania
Superior Court which overturned
the conviction in a landmark- ruling
allowing for a “moral justification"
defense. The matter is currently
before the State Supreme Court.

When confronted with the charge
that she pursues these activities for
personal publicity, Rush said, “I
don't think one risks years in jail for
a news story." She said. her critics
“don’t understand our own history."
She cited Martin Luther King Jr.
and the civil rights movement, the
women’s suffrage movement and
l9th century abolitionists as tradi-
tional practitioners of civil
disobedience. _

“It goes back to before the Boston
Tea Party,” said Rush. “Non-violent
resistance has been the catalyst for
any change,” she said. “It’s not a new
tradition.” .

But Rush prefers to downplay
these activities, especially in talking
about the Merton Center.

“People tend to see us only as pro-
testers,”_she said. “In terms of time

Nuclear submarines?

On Dec. 8, the United States Navy
plans to christen a multi-million dol-
lar nuclear-powered, fast attack sub-
marine with the name honoring the
city of Pittsburgh.

The 360-foot U.S.S. Pittsburgh
will be the thirty-third Los Angeles-
class nuclear powered sub. The
Pittsburgh is the newest of the-most
technically advanced undersea ves-
sels in the world. It is faster than its
predecessors and is equipped with
highly accurate sensors and weap-
ons control systems. The U.S.S.
Pittsburgh will be the first of the
attack submarines
capacity to launch cruise missile
vertically. ‘ , ‘-

This feature will allow the vessel

to participate not only in sea war-.

fare, but also in land warfare. The
forward-based launch platform was
designed specifically for land attack
Tomahawk missiles by the
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse.
The Tomahawk missile, a sub-

sonic, jet propelled, long range mis-

sile, has the capacity to travel 1,500
miles per hour. The missile ﬂies at a
low altitude in order to evade radar
and air defenses. The missile is so
accurate that one defense planner
claimed that “it can place its 200

kiloton warhead down the chimney _

of the Kremlin.”

According to Lieutenant Cox,
aboard the U.S.S. Pittsburgh, “The
vessel has the capacity to carry
numerous Mark 48 torpedos, 20
Tomahawk missiles and several de-
harpoon missiles." ' '

Pittsburgh, including one local pro-
test group, the Thomas Merton Cen-
ter. It is an organization supporting
peace and social justice and is taking
a strong and vocal opposition to the

naming of the submarine after the P

city of Pittsburgh. M

David Hostetler, a spokesman for
the Merton Center, says that their
main concern is the fact that the
U.S.S. Pittsburgh has the capacity
of carrying strategic nuclear weap-
ons. The center feels that “naming
such a submarine after Pittsburgh
would be similiar to naming acou-

By Walter Watson
Special to The Pitt News

Editor's Note: This is the second
part ofa story that ran Monday.

Baldwin: I think there's some-
thing romantic about it. I don't
know how to put that, Walt, in a way
that’s not romantic at all. Look, I’m
very glad that boys and girls, men
and women are less oppressed or vic-
timized or any better on the job, if
that is true. Obviously, one has the
right to live, and in order to live, first
we have to step out of the definition.
You can’t use the definitions that
will kill you, to liberate yourself
from those definitions.

PN: I guess what's problematic is
that we are all bound to the same
language.

Baldwin: We're bound to the same
language, but not the same percep-
tions, you know?

' PN: OK.

Baldwin: You've asked me a very
loaded question which is impossible
to do justice to, in any case. What I
am saying at bottom is that the only
other person in my bedroom besides
myself and the one Ilove, who has a
right to be there, is God almighty.
Not the church, not the state,
nobody. It's nobody’s business but
mine. _

PN: One other thing that came
out of the Voice interview is that you
felt that there will be a time in the

future when that portion of the pop-.

ulation that, as you say, romanti-
cizes its oppression will no longer
have to go by the title “gay "or "gay
community, "meaning that they will,

  AuthorBaldwintalks
on life, love and the future

in’ fact —

Baldwin: They will be part of the
human .community.

PN: They'll be part of humanity.
Do you have similar hopes and
visions for the race question for
black Americans?

Baldwin: Yes, yes, yes. ..

PN: You had said that you didn't
foresee the first thing happening in
your lifetime; is that foresight sim-
ilar in that respect for blacks?

Baldwin: Well, yes and no. By the
time one reaches my age, one has
seen a lot, has seen too little. I've
seen some things in my lifetime. And
they might happen and I might not
see them.

But what am I saying? It seems to

' me that there is a level at which

they’re both connected. The sexual
question in America and the race

' question in America are two sides of

the same coin, you know. It’s com-

pounded "in a country so sexually _

infantile. Men and women have as
great a problem here as men and

_men, or women and women; though

when I say that, people will think
that, you know, I'm trying to justify_
something.

' But if you’re talking about love,
this country penalizes lovers in an
incredible way. The whole question
of sexual preference is a red herring.
To obliterate the terror which, in
this’ country, every lover is greeted,
with — you cannot win a popularity

contest ‘if you’re a lover. It doesn't’

make a difference who you fall in
love with. If you think love is more
important than something else, then
you’re a danger to your republic, in a
way. If you think that love is more
important than safety, if you think

  openly

it’s more important than money —
do you see what I ‘mean?

PN: Yes, do you see love as the
most important thing?

Baldwin: Yes, I think it’s the key.

PN: Ifyou had one statement to
make concerning your 60 years of
travel through your life, all that you
have seen, how would you explain it
to someone from another planet? To
someone who has not been in Amer-
ica for the past 25 years?

Baldwin: Do you mean how
would I explain it to my congress-
man in Washington? (Laughs.)

PN: Well, let's try that.

Baldwin: I’m being a little frivo-
lous when I say that, but I wouldn't
try to explain it. It’s all very clear.

PN: What are your hopes for the
world? . * ‘

Baldwin: I suppose, that people
stop Victimizing each other. '

PN: Victimizing, in what way?

Baldwin: Victimizing each other
in — I victimize you, not because of
what I see in you, but because of me
wanting to kill myself. What I see in
you, I try to destroy; it’s not what I
see in you, it’s what I see in me.
That's what I’m trying to destroy.

PN: What is that?

Baldwin: Whatever I don't want

to be. Whatever I don’t want to be is i

you representing it. Therefore I have
to kill you.

PN: Don't kill me.

Baldwin: I'm not talking about
that. But that’s what’s happening all

' over. ‘So my hope is that one day,

human beings will grow up to realize
that there’s no way to crack the mir-
ror, you know. We're all connected
and every human being has a right to
be here.

centration camp after Pittsburgh."
The Merton Center wants to know
why the Navy claims that the role of
the sub is to attack enemy subs when
the vertical launch system (the main
new feature for the Tomahawk mis-
sile) was purposely designed for land
attack. .
The center has also made claims
that the combined destructive force
of just the 20 Tomahawk missiles
equals approximately 307 Hiro-
shima bombs. Furthermore, the
Merton Center claims that the small
size of the missiles makes them
extremely hard to verify by techno-
logical means. This would make it
nearly impossible for enemies to
know whether a submarine is armed
with a conventional or nuclear
warhead.

Lieutenant Cox said, “The vessel
has the capacity to carry this arma-
ment, but this doesn't guarantee that
it will.” Cox declined in saying any-
thing referring to the force of the
missiles that the Merton Center
claimed them to have, and he
avoided the question of whether or
not the missiles can be detected by
technological means. ‘‘I can’t answer
the claims,” said Cox.

Gary Gunderson, public affairs
officer of the U.S. Navy Pittsburgh
division, said, “This type of informa-
tion is unavailable to us. Pacifist
groups such as the Merton Center
are known to make claims like
these.”

There have been similar protests
in other cities over the use of their
names for attack submarines, but
none have been successful. The most
well-known protest became nation-
wide when the U.S. Navy

announced the launching of the

U.S.S. Corpus Christi. Pacifists and
religious groups across the nation
united in opposition because the
name translated in Latin means “the
body of Christ." The Navy compro-
mised by naming the sub the “U.S.S.
City of Corpus Christi.” .
The Merton Center claims that
they received their information from
a guide on nuclear submarines and
their capabilities called the “Nuclear
Weapons Data Book,” which is pub-
lished by the Natural Resources
Defense Council and from classiﬁed
government information. The Mer-
ton Center claimed that the Navy
corroborated most of the center’s
information with the exception of

The Evil Truth

Many modern thinkers have attended themselves consistently to the

Orwellian ﬂavor of “doublespeak” found to be penetrating today’s_

media. A French political sociologist, Jacques Ellul, provides a sur-
prisingly complete and intelligent analysis of the propaganda pheno-
menon in his book “Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes.“
Concerning the distortion of truth or fact, Ellul suggests that an
accusation aimed at another’s intentions clearly reveals the intention
of the accuser. . ,

Think of Ellul’s comment upon reading the headline of the
“National Policy Watch,” the newsletter of the National Center for
Public Policy Research: “National Center Fights Communists, Pro-
paganda in Central America." It is as if one is expected to applaud or
quiver with warmth in response to the first sentence: “The National
Center continues to fight communism in Central America." Yes, the
statement does exude a sensation of triumph.

The National Center for Public Policy Research, located in
Washington, D.C., is a “tax-exempt charitable foundation under
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.” Its chairman, Burton
Yale Pines, staff and executive director, Amy Moritz, work “with
young conservatives on thousands of college and high school cam-
puses” to persuade the public that “conservative principles are the key
to a safe, prosperous America.” This is the agency that sponsored
national Student Liberation Day, a project designed to deliver the
truth about the U.S. mission in Grenada.

This pseudo-propaganda ministry is engaged in a “massive public
information campaign on the communist threat to Central America.”
The center distributes, free of charge, over a quarter-million anti-
communist brochures such as that titled “Stop the War in' Central
America: Halt the Sandinista Attack on Jobs, Peace and Freedom in
the Americas." Upon request, one can receive a Student Activist
Package loaded with leaflets and brochures on topics ranging from the
Soviet Union's use of chemical warfare in Afghanistan to the merits of
President Reagan's Star Wars defense system. The center strongly

advocates Reagan's “Peace through Strength" policy and consistently .
commends the conservative ideals promoted by U.N. representative V _

Jeanne Kirkpatrick. .

Repeated throughout the center‘s brochures are simplistic slogans
supporting the Reagan administration and the Moral Majority and
favorable quotations from letters by various readers and politicians.
Representative Thomas Hartnett from South Carolina wrote, “your
effort to expose the evil truth about communism is a highly commen-
dable one." The way that the words “Conservatives Write" appear in
large bold print at the top of the last page of the newsletter gives the
impression of some sort of social movement and that the word “con-
servative” requires glorification due to either a past reputation of
illegitimacy or a current attempt to increase the group's desirability
and attractiveness.

Ellul maintains that “propaganda is necessarily false when it speaks
of values, of truth, of good, of justice, of happiness and when it
interprets and colors facts." This is the essence of present—day conser-
vative propaganda. The manipulation of values such as the virtue of
work and free enterprise, the family and political democracy consti-

utes a frame of reference for the systematic falsification of informa-

C tion. It is frightening to believe that so many well-intentioned people

are just eating this stuff up. e

  Letters

Liberals h
Lack Humor

The angry letters. written in
response to Michael Flanigan, The
Pitt News, Nov. 21, 1984 proved
three things:

1) Liberals have no sense of
humor. Surely Mr. Flanigan does.
not really believe that Jimmy Carter
has two X chromosomes any more
than he believes an X-ray of Walter

» Mondale would reveal a total lack of

I

vertebrae, as spinelessness is a trait
of wimps. Mr. Flanigan’s detractors
took him much too seriously.

2) Liberals operate under a double
standard. It's okay to call Ronald
Reagan a “right-wing cretin," but
don't you dare call Walter Mondale
a “wimp,” even if he is one.

3) Liberals are not the "optimistic,
forward-looking" individuals they
would have us believe them to be.
Instead, they are hidebound author-
itarians and sore losers to boot;
hence the letters which spoke from a
“you'll be sorry Reagan won”
attitude. ,

Two of the letters attacked Mr.
Flanigan" for resorting to name-
calling instead of presenting logical
arguments. In that same issue, you
published a letter from a Mr. Frank
Loreti, who did use logical argu-
ments to demonstrate the “naked
stinking evil“ of the recent Catholic
bishop's pastoral letter concerning
the economy. This letter, was most
refreshing, although obviously not
for the same reasons that Mr. Flani-
gan’s was; Mr. Loreti apparently
shares my enthusiasm for Ayn

Rand, Milton Friedman, Ludwig .

von Mises and several other writers
whose works make an excellent anti-
dote to youropinion pages. Yet now

Unfair
Complaints

As an alumnus of Pitt, 1 am dis-
turbed by the recent assaults on the
university police by The Pitt News.

While working asa graduate stu-
dent V
acquainted with a number of Pitt
policemen and I know as a fact that
many of them attend college and

in mathematics, ' I “became .

year. (I believe the city police qualify
only once a year.)

Officers are required to call out
for their half-hour lunch break and
two short coffee breaks and the time
they are out is recorded. They are
not permitted to call out in groups
and they are actually on duty even
on their breaks. Many times they
leave a lunch half-eaten to go on call.

The Pitt police respond faster
than the city police to campus prob-
lems. They assist Life Flight with
transporting organs for transplant,
find lost children, escort.students,
faculty and staff, provide traffic con-
trol, aid the injured and on and on.
They have a professional organiza-
tion but don’t get the credit they
deserve.

As a graduatestudent, I appre-
ciated the Pitt policemen who came
by my office every couple of hours to
check on me as I studied late at
night. . -

At the college where Ijam now as
an associate professor of mathemat-
ics, our security officers are retired

truck drivers and plant guards who -

are trying to supplement their Social
Security. .

Pitt students and staff should be
proud of and thankful for a well-
trained, professional police
department. ‘

the power of Capitol police in “Pur-

learned that Capitol police do not

to the Editor

ments of thosecities.

In the course of guarding state
buildings and their grounds, Capitol
police exercise the same power as
city police if the city police were
guarding them instead of the Capitol
police. But Capitol police don’t have
the powers of city police when the
Capitol police are not in state
buildings.

When the state legislature granted
the Pitt campus cops the same power
as Capitol police, the legislature did
not mean that the campus police
were to assume police power any-
where in the entire commonwealth,
nor did it intend that the Pitt campus
cops were to assume police_power
anywhere in the city of Pittsburgh in
needless duplication «of the city

police. What the legislature clearly L

intended was that the campus cops
were to have the same power to
guard the campus that city police
would have if they were guarding the
campus. Merely that, and nothing
more. ‘

Joseph Forbes

Control
Those Cops

I read the Nov. 2 article on the Pitt
campus police, and I read Joseph
Forbes’ thought-provoking letter to
the editor in your Nov. 19 issue. I
think Mr. Forbes raised some good
points. My tuition keeps going up.
Pitt cuts back on the schools of edu-

‘. cation andpublic and international

affairs. Yet the campus cops boast
about roaming the entire state with-
out supervision or control. If the
campus police would restrict them-
selves to the campus, I'm sure they
could reduce the size of the force and
save a lot of money that might be
reflected in lower tuition.

I have taken the time to .read the
act of the State Legislature from
which the Pitt campus cops claim
their broad, unrestricted authority. I
have read‘ the act very thoroughly.

A Nowhere does the act say that the

University of Pittsburgh administra-

tion _has no authority or obligation

to control and supervise the campus

police and hasto, let them run‘ loose, ,

I think Joseph Forbes was right on

' target when he said in his letter that

. the Pitt ‘campus cops have read far

too much unrestiained authority in‘ '

the legislature’s Act I49.

are the campus cops directed to go
roaming all over the commonwealth
making arrests in the jurisdiction of
other police forces. Nowhere does
the act direct the Pitt campus cops to
duplicate the Pittsburgh City Police.
They read too much into the act.

I see no evidence that the city
police are unable to perform their
law enforcement functions. It is cer-
tainly a wasteful, unnecessary
expenditure for the campus cops to
be a city-wide, state-wide police
force. Why do they need a detective
bureau? Anything off-campus
except for hot pursuit should not be
the concern of the campus police but
should be turned over to the city
police or another appropriate police

force. For example, the campus’

cops’ arrest of someone on the North
Side several miles from campus
could easily have been handled
entirely by the city police.

Since the university administra-
tion is trimming everything else to
save money, why not trim the cam-
pus cops? If the administration pays
‘cm, the administration can control
‘em.

Only God Saves

This letter is. in response to Frank

R; Ruskowitz’s Nov.26 editorial

“Spiritual Holocaust."

Spiritual is defined by those who
are the seers of the truth as that
which iseternal such as the soul,and
the soul is invisible, inconceivable,
immutable and unchanging, and can
never be cut into pieces by any wea-
pon, nor can be burned by fire, nor
moistened by water or withered by
wind.

Mr. Ruskowitz also spoke of
“people’s pride in their country and

.in themselves and hope for tomor-

row.” How can we claim it is our
country? Before us it belonged to the
Indians and before them someone
else, but where is their claim now?

If there is a nuclear war, will any
of us have a claim?_ Maybe, until the
certainty of death befalls us all leav-
ing no “tomorrow.”

Although to many. people such as
Mr. Ruskowitz, the strategies of
nuclear deterrence employed by the
nuclear superpowers may seem a
brilliant solution to the problem of
how to rriaintain peace in the nuclear
age, such a solution leaves us all at
our peril. At any moment a human
or mechanical error could engulf the
world in. a nuclearwar.

. Nor can disarmament conferences .
or anti-nuclear rallies save us.

Through disobedience to the laws of
God, we have summoned the immi-
nent destruction of ourselves and
our godless civilization, and the
aggregate volume of sin continues to
grow. , '
You take pride in your country
which allows 1.5 million abortions a
year as well as the deaths of 34 mil-
lion cows, three million little calves,
90 million pigs, five million sheep
and lamb, four billion chickens, and
let's not forget to give thanks for the
150 million turkeys sent screaming
to. their deathslevery year. They are
also part of ‘our country. Why
shouldn't they be protected?
Actually, in the Bhagavad-Gita it
is stated “whatever action is per-

formed by a great man, common _

men follow in his footsteps. And
whatever standards he sets by exem-
plary acts, all the world pursues.”
So, factually, the leader of -the coun-
try is expected to do what will ulti-
mately benefit his people. That we
don’t authentically find in our mod-
ern day politicians.

Thoughtful, men should under-

stand that we have to change the
quality of our lives and become,

attuned to the desires of the
Supreme Person. The desire of
Krishna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is that people live in God

Consciousness, free from such for- ~

bidden activities as illicit sex and
animal slaughter. At least those'sur-
vivalists who acknowledge the exis-
tence of God should pursue logic to
its ngnt conclusion and understand
that only God’ can save us from
nuclear annihilation. As people

Bo-Diddly Tech

We've wondered how your uni-
versity and student body feel about
being referred to as “Bo-diddly
Tech" by Bryant Gumbel on his
broadcast on the NBC Today Show,
Tuesday, Nov. 20. He was express-
ing, in a very unprofessional
manner, his opinion of Brigham
Young University’s ranking as the
top ‘football team in the nation by
calling all of their opponents “Bo-
diddly Tech.” THIS MEANS YOU"!
The BYU fans are impressed with
your university and football team
and enjoyed the challenge of playing
you, and we do not feel that you are
the low-class team that Mr. Gumbel
seems to think you are.

If you would like to express your
opinion to Bryant Gumbel and NBC
regarding his comment, the phone
number is 212-664-4444, and the

From Terminal 5/ Stuart Little pp p p
And Now for Something Completely Accurate

Because of an obvious confusion
surrounding the terms “liberal” and
‘‘conservative‘’ that has evidenced

itself in The Pitt News in past letters ~ —

and columns (old and of late), I have
taken it upon myself to right the
matter by consulting the ‘ Pocket
Oxford Dictionary (the ﬁnal word in
modern English spelling and usage).
“Conservative" refers to “tending
to conserve; averse to rapid changes;
(of views, taste, etc.) moderate,
avoiding extremes.” J ,
“Liberal” refers to “Givenor giv-
ing- freely, generous, not sparing of,
abundant; open-minded, not preju-
diced; not strict or rigorous; for gen-
eral broadening of mind; favoring
moderate political or social reform.”
Given these definitions, it is diffi-
cult, if not impossible without aban-

doning reason, to justify the recent
labeling of President Reagan, Jesse
Helms, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Caspar
Weinberger, William Casey and

Margaret Thatcher as conservative."

A person. disposed to “avoiding

‘ extremes” would probably not gen-

erously grant $50 million at the drop
of a cowboy hat to a regime that that
person knows to practice murder,
intrigue and despotism. Nor would
such a person seek to undermine the
tenability of a government of a sov-
ereign and independent nation
because that government’s thinking
differs from his own.

A conservative person would not
be‘ likely to refer to an adversary as
an “evil empire." A conservative
must, by definition, be without an

all-pervasive ideology (though with

a clearly deﬁned morality, to be
sure). He must make decisions based
on nothing save the factual evidence
before him. Winston Churchill,
Albert Einstein, George McGovern
and Woodrow Wilson are perfect
examples of conservative men who
have avoided extremes, faced fac-
tual evidence in the real world and
made decisions on the basis of those
observations.

Karl Marx was not a liberal. Nor

is ‘Walter Mondale (not that we "

lump these men together). Jesse
Jackson is probably the only major
liberal political figure today. A lib-
eral could not recommend an
increase in military spending during
“peacetime" unless there were clear
facts and figures to warrant such an

increase (there are not), certainly not _

at the expense of much‘-needed 

social programs. Nor would he do so
if there were no money to support
such an increase. A liberal could not
claim that the history of man has
been a scientifically explainable ser-

ies of necessary events resulting  -- 

from other necessary events.

- Americans have, in recent years,
been inclined to strain and pull
vocabulary beyond reasonable lim-
its. ,Of course, a language does
require some degree of manipula-

tion if it is to be used in different . _ .
contexts at different times. How-. i

ever, it is not reasonable to tailor a
term to fit a desired definitionthat is
wildly removed from that words
origin. A book should not be
referred to as a peach simply because
one is hungry.

and energy expended [civil disobe-
dience] is a small part of what we
do.”

This was reinforced by Mabel
Karsh, a l0-year member of the cen-
ter, who said, “Our members all sup-
port civil disobedience but they
don't all do it. I’m a supporter.”

“We do a lot of things that are
invisible,” said Rush. And she was
eager to talk about these “invisible”
things, such as food banks set up
through Hunger Action Coalition,
or the chapter of Amnesty Interna-
tional which the center founded, or
the Giving Tree gift shop, in which
the center imports items manufac-
tured in Third World countries to
sell here.

But the main thrust of the center
seems to be the dissemination of
information suporting their many
aims. The Merton Center is set up
like a book shop and maintains a
lending library and rents slides and-
films on such topics as hunger, draft
resistance and nuclear weapons. The
center regularly brings into town
various speakers that espouse view-
points similar to theirs. They pro-
mote active lobbying of legislators
and most of all, they stage demon-
strations such as picket lines and sit-
ms.
When Secretary of Defense Cas-
par Weinberger came to town to
make an address at the Hilton Hotel,

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 28, 1984 I

Members of Merton   Center value social justice

Thomas Merton Center activists
were outside the hotel with posters
of President Reagan with a clock
superimposed over his face. Under-
neath the poster read, “We begin
bombing in five minutes.” They
admonished the many going inside
to hear Weinberger, saying, “Your
future is at stake!”

Activists from the Merton Center
were out in force when Jesse Jack-
son spoke at a Mondale rally in
Market Square the ‘Friday before
the election. One carried a petition
asking that .the U.S.S. Pittsburgh
not carry the name of Pittsburgh due
to its nuclear capacity. Another was
dressed in a red, white and blue
Unc-le Sam costume.

“This is the real Uncle Sam,” he
told a reporter as he waved toward
the crowd gathered to hear Jackson.
“Find out who the other Uncle Sam
is who travels all over the world
abusing people." _

The Merton Center also cooper-

‘ ates with other peace groups, such as

the Physicians for Social Responsi-
bility, the Ground Zero Peace Com-
munity, the Pittsburgh Mennonite
Church and many others. Two local
groups the center has helped insti-
tute and actively promote are the
Pittsburgh Peace Institute and the
River City Non-violent Resistance
Campaign. The River City Cam-
paign often demonstrates against

the Pittsburgh-headquartered West-

inghouse and Rockwell corpora-
tions due to their work with Defense
Department weapons contracts.

“We’re a clearinghouse in a lot of
ways,” said Molly Rush. “Any
group interested in peace work will
be in touch with us.”

She volunteered that the center
will work “with groups like the
Socialist Worker’s Party even
though we may not agree with them
on many things.”

When her attention was brought
to an East German communist pub-
lication in the back of the center,
Rush said, “People call us commu-
nists, but that's not fair. We take our
politics from Scripture and Gospel
rather , than any ideological

‘ philosophy.” .

Art McDonald says that his faith
and religious beliefs are“the base" of
his political activism, but he stressed
that is “not true of all Merton folks.”
McDonald, a graduate student at
the University of Pittsburgh in reli-
gious studies, organized the Witness
for Peace group that arranged sanc-
tuary in the Point Breeze Mennonite
Church for a Salvadoran couple
brought into the U.S. illegally.
McDonald cited the sanctuary as a
“creative response to this tragic
situation [Central America].” He
said it was a‘ means to provide “con-
crete help to people yet raise politi-
cal issues.” I

McDonald has also taken part in

acts of civil disobedience. He and 11
others, including Molly Rush, were
arrested June 11 of this year after
conducting a sit-in at the office of
Republican Senator John Heinz.
The sit-in was staged to object to his
support of U.S. foreign policy in
Central America. McDonald is also
a member of the Central America
Mobilization Council. ‘

“Civil disobedience has a place,”
said McDonald, but he warned that
it “needs to be very selective and
clear in what it is trying to
accomplish.” .

“We need the Merton Center at
times,” says Father Rich Zelik, a
Capuchin priest whose ministry is
devoted to peace and justice.
“They're on the front in terms of
dealing with social issues.” Zelik
said that he is indirectly involved
with the Merton Center in its “Rock-
well activities” and he makes use of
the center's educational materials.

The-Capuchin religious order Zelik .

belongs to maintains missionaries in
Nicaragua and El Salvador and has
“pledged resistance” should the U.S.
become active there militarily.

“I have no qualms with civil dis-
obedience," said the Capuchin friar.
“When you‘re doing social justice
work it’s important to bring the
issues down to everyday people."

Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Office

Intercultural House works for integration

By Michael Fowler
The Pitt News

“This [the Intercultural House] is
not just for students coming to live
here,” said house director Joseph
Stimﬂ. “It's based on those students,
but should radiate in many
directions."

The Intercultural House, located
at 727 North Dithridge St., was
opened in l969 by the Gertrude

Stein Foundation to help resolve
conflict between blacks and whites.
Its goals for this year focus‘ on an
increase in involvement from the
community. r

The house staff is currrently look-
ing for two members of the Oakland
and university communities to
become active members of its policy
council. According to Stimﬂ, the
policy council makes house rules
and helps to coordinate activities for
house members and the community.

“Activities," he added, “are built

around cultural difference and,
sometimes, cultural conﬂict. " House
members are attempting to organize
lectures, in-house dinners and even a
volleyball team. ,

In addition to recruiting com-
munity members, the Intercultural
House is also looking for a graduate
student to volunteer as program,
coordinator. The program coordi-
nator organizes the-efforts of house
members and the policy council in
finding lecturers and planning
activities. '

The Intercultural House is also
planning to make financial aid avail-
able in the winter term, if possible.
“The aid would amount to about a
10 percent reduction in house fees
for eligible students,” Stimfl
stressed. The aid program would be
specifically intended to recruit can-
didates who could not afford to pay
house fees without assistance.

One-third of the house’s members
are white Americans, one-third are
minority students, and one-third are
foreign students.

comment on the center's civil dis-
obedience activities, saying,
“There's no official stand on it.” But
he said he was pleased whenever
“people work for social justice in the
community. I may not agree with
their [the Merton Center’s] specific
stand every time,” said Father New-
meyer, “[but] I’m happy there is such
a place as'the Merton Center."

A somewhat less sympathetic
voice was that of Judge Robert
Dauer. Speaking specifically of
Molly Rush’s record, Dauer said,
“She has a right to do some of the
things she does." But in reference to
the Plowshares Eight incident,
Dauer said, “It’s one thing to speak
your mind as guaranteed by the
Constitution, and quite another to
disrupt private industry. Other peo-
ple have rights too. ‘They can say
what they want  and criticize
anyonethey want  but they can’t
break the law of the State of
Pennsylvania."

“What we’re trying to do is ques-
tion the moral and ethical rightness
of the arms race,” said Molly Rush.
Even though Rush has the specter of
a jail sentence over her shoulder she
made it plain that she would pursue
again her campaign of civil.
disobedience. -

“People think if they vote they

exercise their citizenship. Citizen-

ship is a lot more than that.”

Armstrong looks to improve
over last season’s statistics

By Jim (lrban
The Pitt News

Many have compared playing in
the Big East conference to playing in
the land of the giants. One need look
no further than Georgetown to find

7-0 Patrick Ewing and 6-H Ralph"

Dalton. Add to that Villanova’s 6.-9
Ed Pinckney, St. John’s'. 7-0 Bill
Wennington and _Syra-cuse’s 6-8
Andre Hawkins, and it is no wonder
why‘ Pitt coach Roy Chipman was
prompted to state, “I believe that if
we are going to compete inithe Big
East, we must have a bonafide ce_n-
ter.” Chipman’s candidate for that
position .is 6-9, 244-pound Keith
Armstrong.

Armstrong isajunior from Ypsi-
lanti, Mich., who presents an intimi-
dating figure in the middle of the
Panther lineup. As a senior at Ypsi-
lanti High School, Armstrong was
an all-state performer in both foot-
ball and basketball. He excelled at
tight end anddefensive end on the
football team and received several
sch larship offers in that sport, but
he opted for basketball over foot-

.ball..“Playing basketball is a lot

more fun than playing football,”
said Armstrong. “Pitt was in the Big
East,.so I chose Pitt.” .

Chipman could not be any happi-
er over Armstrong’s choice of a
school. As a-freshman, Armstrong
appeared in 24 games during Pitt’s
‘inaugural season in the Big East.
Last year, Armstrong was the only

player other than Clyde Vaughan to ,

start every game. Armstrong aver-
aged only 4.4 points and 5.5
rebounds per game, but both coach
and player feel that there has been
definite improvement in Arm-
strong’s game.

“Keith is a greatly improved
player, and I think ‘it has showed in
the first two games,” said Chipman
of Armstrong’s performance so far
this season. Armstrong has doubled
his totals from last season. Through
two games, Armstrong has averaged
12.5 points per game and ,8.5
rebounds per game. It was never a
matter of ability but more a matter
of playing _a smart ballgame.

“Last year,,I was in the wrong
place at the wrong time a lot,” said
Armstrong. “I think my mind is a lot
better this year, and I’m in more
control.”

Chipman agreed: “We want Keith
to anticipate rebounds better this
year. We want him in position
instead of standing around.” Arm-
strong spent the summer sharpening
his skills in the Connie Hawkins
Summer Pro -Basketball League.
With -Armstrong’s size (his legs
resemble tree trunks), the rebounds
will come, and so will the points.

While this year marks the begin-
ning of the post-Vaughan era, Arm-
strong is confident that the loss of
Vaughan will help the team in the
long run. “Last year, we relied on
Clyde too much and it hurt us at

Freshman Charles Smith

The first thing you notice about

Charles Smith, for his imposing,

almost frightening 6-I0 height are

' his eyes.

_ Set deep in the face ofthe man Pitt
hopes will be the catalyst to national
basketball prominence are those
eyes — two wide circles gazing
intently on the action on the Fitzger-
ald Field House court, but focusing
on nothing. As the women's team
ran through a scrimmage, Smith
talked of his glory-filled schoolboy
days in Connecticut and of the
future at Pitt. Maybe that is what the
eyes were looking at —' The Future
Unlimited of Mr. Charles Smith.

Chipman balances act

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Your typical juggling act it isn’t.
Circuses never heard of it. No one
knows if Houdini did. ‘

Roy Chipman, interestingly,
knows about this act of balancing.
He has to. His basketball team’s for-
tunes this coming season ride on
whether he can withstand the urge to
tilt after losing 37 points worth of
production per game in 1983-84 and
only returning 12.5 ppg. this season.

Off to a 1-0 start on a 10-game
swing before the Big East muscles its
way onto the schedule, no one yet
notices any tendencies to slide.

Certainly not Chipman.

“The biggest thing_is we have to

- distribute the ball better,” Chipman

said three weeks prior to the start of
his fifth year with the Panthers.
“We’re not going to make it up with
one player, we're not even going to
make it up with two players.”
Contrary to popular opinion, the
Bridgeport, Conn. _giant — 6-10
Charles Smith — does not answer
calls to living up to the legend
preceding "him, namely‘ Clyde
Vaughan. Sure, other players will
occasionally telephone the 215-lb.
freshman under the boards. Just

don't expect them to dance around V

the paint waiting for Smith to ﬁnd

_ his hole. _.
Instead, the front-courtveterans‘

will collude with point guard Curtis
Aiken, speeding up Chipman’s over-
all game plan, though not fully dis-
posing of what has been primarily a
halfcourt game lately. Perhaps
affairs would seem more secure were

it not for George Allen’s academic 

redshirt. Chipman will miss the flash
and brilliance Allen spiced his 11.7
ppg. with last year.

“We’re going to run, we’re going
to be smart," Chipman said. “Any-
tirrie you ‘live and die off one thing,
you get shut off, you get beat. We
have enough quickness to be confi-
dent either way.” .

That’s the scrambled code hidden

-amidst this talented but inexpe-

rienced corps. Heading it up is
Smith, who doesn’t overshadow
senior forwards Chip Watkins or
Andre Williams. It’s just that Chip-
man dresses him a starter in his first
year. How often does that happen?
Well, how often in the past has Pitt
snagged a Charles Smith?

“You’re talking about the premier
player in the country,” Chipman
said unabashedly. “He doesn’t go at
full speed, he just goes out and plays.
And he’s so mature, emotionally.
He’s not always physical out there,

but he has the maturationand physi- ‘

cal stability. He's confident, but not
cocky." . . ‘

Later, Chipman added, “The dif-
ference between a good and a great
player is a great one makes the play-
ers around him better; someone like
the Pearl [Washington], [Chris]
Mullin, Patrick [Ewing]. He has that
[capability].“

Formalities now dispensed with,
next question: To what extent will
those surrounding players -fit into
the scheme of things?

The biggest turnaround must
come from center Keith Armstrong,
a sophomore starter last season who
limped along with 4.4 rebounds and
5.5 pointsper game. Granted, he led
the Panthers with 56 blocked shots.

Chipman still searches for what’s
been elusive strength inside. Now_‘s
thevtime for Armstrong to halt the
lengthy investigation. Chipman
“likes to think he's pretty percep-
tive,“ after filling out to a muscular

» 244. Armstrong's also spent time
with Dr. Jerry Chesin, a hypnotistg

when he's not practicing medicine.
“I was displeased to thepoint I
wanted to score, but I needed game
experience," Armstrong said
recently. “It was inexperience
because I found myself out of posi-
tion a lot. I was going for blocks

when I knew I couldn’t get them. ‘

Now l’ve learned to stay in control
whether I'm defending a man or on.
offense.” . _

Which brings Chipman to his
third Big East season, in the land of
Bill Wennington, Eddie Pinckney,
Andre Hawkins and Washington‘s
Monument. “The thing we’ve tried
to convince him to do is not be wor-
ried about his offense, but his
defense," Chipman said. “He still
has the same goals as before and
seems to work hard at them. When
the ball tips off some guys continue
to work as hard as in practice. Oth-
ers fade into the woodwork. Hope-
fully, Keith won’t do that this
season.”

Though Chip Watkins (6-7, 205)
appears to have the inside track at
the other forward spot ever since
Williams -popped a kneecap several
weeks ago, nothing is deﬁnite as of
now. After starting last year,
though, the 6-8, 223-lb. Williams‘

V7.0 ppg. won't do this year. .

“Andre will get ‘more playing time
and be given the ball more," Chip-
man said. “Last year, Andre was
more in a passive position and felt

that Clyde could take care of the-‘

running and scoring inside. Right
now, we're going to be playing eight
different guys up front. Probably
more than we'll ever want to use in
December. That means we’re going
to give everyone an opportunity to
play." .

That's good news for forwards
like Darryl Shepherd and Marlon
Ferguson. The adjustment is over

There’s high praise and high pres-

sure for a I9-year-old from Bridge-

port‘s Warren Harding High. But ;

Smith is no stranger to the intense ‘- '

glare of the national spotlight. In»
high school his accomplishments:
and awards were enough to make '

.any college coach drool.

Consider: He was named to the .‘ ' I"

and the first team Parade All-_,

all -— in his final two years his team , ’

Smith is an experienced bearer of ' E

not really,” he said. ‘‘It‘s a good feel-

ing, but I don't think I've felt much_
pressure so far since we are not really‘ 3
into our season yet." ‘ 1 5

What Smith calls the “season" is  _ 

the Big East season, which starts in 

‘January. But in the Panthers’ first 

game of the year on Monday, the
freshman played a solid if not over-
whelming game, scoring 16 points}
and grabbing nine rebounds in 21 f

minutes of playing. Smith also ran ,'

into some foul trouble. Four infrac-

tions were called on him by early in 

the second half. . ;
For Smith the “good feeling" ;

came the summer before his senior 3 ‘V _
year while he was playing at the Five ; ‘

nia. History buffs may want to ;
record that. It was then that Smith i
knew he was special, that he realized :

I 

he was so much more than good. “I  _ * i

doing pretty well against the top tal- ,
ent in the country, so I knew that I 2'
was at least as good as they were.” 5

When he returned for his senior

the relentless defenses teams stuck Q
on him, but he would have to deal 3’
with equally unrelenting recruiters-,5
from virtually every school you_‘ve :

Smith signed with Pitt. _ '

“Three schools in the Big East», g

For better or worse, this will be
the last Moore ldeas column to
grace the pages of The Pitt News.

My days in Oakland are num-
bered and it seems as good a time as
any to hang up my career at The Pitt
News. It has been a unique
experience.

It all started four years ago in the
basement of what then was called
Schenley Hall, now known to us as
the William Pitt Union. I was hired
as a proofreader (that goes to show

you can fool some of the people

some of the time). The hours stank,
the pay was lousy but the people I
worked with were great.

The sports editor at that time was
a young lady named Johnette How-
ard. She was the best sportswriter I
have ever worked with at The Pitt

- News and is now with the Detroit

Free Press, covering inner city high
school sports. Sounds like fun. I can
see the headline now: “Drive
stopped at goal when quarterback
stabbed.” Go get ‘em, Johnette.

The next year I returned to The
Pitt News, now on the fourth floor (I
was moving up). That was the year I
first had a byline.

I was writing columns then and
my editor was Barry Zasloff. Well, I
was trying to write columns. By the

 FOR EVERYONE wires

The Pitt News, Wednesday," November

time Zasloff was done with them I
might have one or two ofthe original
sentences in the story. He called it
editing. I called it murder.

That winter I got my first regular
assignment, or beat. I was in charge
of women’s track and ﬁeld at Pitt. It
might not sound too glamorous, but
it was a lot of fun and I made a lot of
friends that I will have even after I
leave the university.

The next year I moved on to men's
track and field and then to the status
I hold today —- opinionated
columnist.

Although my grades may have
suffered from working the l l p.m. to
2 a.m. shift, I don’t regret a minute
of it. There are things that you can
learn when you go to college that
you can't find in any book, things
that just have to be done. The Pitt
News has been an education in itself.

The best thing about working here
is the people you work with and the
people you meet while doing your
stories. While working here I have
come to know such non-household
names as Alfreeda Goff and Sue
Torre and many more, whom I now
call my friends, as well as more
familiar names like Clinton Davis
and Roger Kingdom.

The worst thing about working
here has to be seeing what the power
of the pen can do in the wrong
hands. A newspaper article is a dan-
gerous thing, even in a college news-

paper like The Pitt News. It can
change people's lives. When we write
a story about someone, we may be
having them benched, expelled or
even ﬁred. You can cause someone a
lot-of suffering by printing some-
thing about them and a lot of
thought should go into_ a story
before the story goes out.

This doesn’t mean sugar-coating
the truth, but editing the story. Is it
important to print an article that
says there is a rumor that someone is
going to leave school, when it isjust
a rumor and will cause everyone
from the person’s parents to his third
grade gym teacher to get telephone
calls for a week? Journalists _should
start thinking about the consequen-
ces of their articles before they are
published, and weigh for themselves
if it is necessary to cause the ruckus
an article can.

The years here, especially this one,
have been fun. This one has proba-
bly beenthe best because I have had
a free hand to write whatever I
please and because it seems like
more people are reading what I
write. There is nothing that makes

me feel better than someone coming
up to me and telling me they liked or
hated my story. I hope that they like
it, but ifthey hate it at least they read

_ it and took the time to hate it.

Now I end my journalistic career
to go out into the world and become
a full-fledged pharmacist, but first
I‘d like to thank some people. I’d like
to thank The Pitt News, which is
made up of people who work very
hard to put this paper out three
times a week, for the opportunity to
write, the athletic department here

Departure time has arrived for columnist

at Pitt for providing me with a lot of
things to write about (some of it
unintentionally), and most of all I
would like to thank those people
who took the time to read this and
some other columns I have written.
Without my classmates at Scaife
Hall and some other students on the
campus reading my work, my time

writing these would have been

wasted because astory that is never
read is a waste of paper and time.

Thanks, everybody. It was a great
ride. Goodbye.

for Duquesne transfer Shepherd,
having only scored l.6ppg. in l6'last

having only scored 1.6 ppg in 16 last &

year. Unlikely a starter right now,
Shepherd teams well as a backup

‘with Ferguson, a 6-8 sophomore

who added about 15 lbs. to his 190-

"lb. frame and appears to have a

somewhat rabid following among
Pitt fans, ever a hard group to
please.

A ﬂu in October, though, side-
lined, Ferguson for four ‘practice
days, “making it hard to play catch-.
up,” Chipman said. “He’s a better

 

player than a year ago and I’d guess
[that] if he wasn’t off the first week,
he'd have been in the first seven or
eight people. Shepherd started out
slow. He’s probably the best inside
scorer we have. Still, he’s got to han-
dle the ball better and recognize his
limitations. I’d like to see him
unload the ball more.” b

In a similar vein, Aiken wouldjust
as well like to unload his freshman
season. From 40 ppg. as shooting
guard at Buffalo’s Bennett High
School, the Parade All-America
became mired in a year that saw him
average 3.6 ppg. and dish out a low
58 assists from the point. Not only
that, it was hard breathing over Billy
Culbertson’s shoulder. Now, no
one’s ahead of (or behind, yet) Aiken
after discontentment.

“I’d get down onmyself because I
knew I didn't shoot that poorly,”
Aiken said. “I tried too much last

-year. I'd get down on myself early in

games. Now, ifl have a bad night l’ll
just put it aside and concentrate on
the next game.” '

Leading Pitt with 21 points
against St. Francis, the floor leader
couldn’t‘ have started any better.
Chipman still looks for refinements,
like ‘ftaking better care of guarding

' the ball. That’s a problem with all

young players. Sometimes they
don’t realize the importance of pos-
session. In high school, you can
create a turnover and it’s no big deal.

I ‘ You come back down,’ score‘. You

can’t do that in the Big East. Give St.‘

 John’s or Syracuse the chance and

they’ll start throwing dirt on your
grave.”

Joey David felt somewhat down-
trodden last season; too, unable to
get the playing time Chipman might
have promised. A topnotch shooter
from Upper St. Clair, David arrived
at Pitt and proceeded to shoot an
average 43 percent from the field the
last two years. With Allen gone,
thought has it he'll start. Right now,
Chipman will start David but is
none too shy of putting freshmen
Demetreus Gore or Junie Lewis on
the ﬂoor.

Gore, Detroit Public League scor-
ing leader_ the last two years, can
play the swing and will likely bethe
sixth man ahead of Lewis. For now,
though, ’David’s being given a
chance to prove himself.

“He has something to prove,”
Chipman added, “and he’s’ been
working hard to prove it. I think a
lot of times he’s been called our best
shooter. The proof of the pudding is
whether the ball goes in the goal.
Joey is capable of bringing out-
standing shots. Now he has to work

on working the ball in further. It’s ’

time to start recognizing his range.
It’s something Joey is learning. He’s
beginning to recognize you can’t
shoot all the time and have to give
the ball up at times.”

_ With four solid people at guard,

: the Panthers further bolstered them-

selves with the return of Charles

Thompson, a senior whose aca- -

demic redshirt last year followed
two ‘years of 47 percent shooting

, Women seek second win against Robert Morris  

   

By Jim Urban
ThePktNews

The Pitt women’s basketball team
will be looking for the second vic-
tory of the season tonight when it

"i hosts the Colonials of Robert Mor-

ris College at 7:30 p.m. at Fitzgerald
Field House. The Panthers are con-
fident after a strong 102-69 victory
over St. Vincent’s College last
Saturday.

Coach Judy Saurer is hoping her
squad will have an easier time
against the Colonials than they did
last year. Pitt found the confines of

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 28‘, 

Robert Morris’ John Jay Center
very uncomfortable last season. The

Panthers were looking at a 10-point -

deficit at halftime but put together a
solid second half and eventually won
the contest 62-54.

“They gave us a hard time," said
Saurer. “They only lost one player
from last year, and she didn’t play
that much.”

Robert Morris is coming off a 64-
58 defeat at the hands of a tough
Youngstown State team on Mon-
day, but Coach Dan Swalga is
counting on seeing a different team
tonight against Pitt.

“We didn’t play up to our poten-
tial against Youngstown State,”

Swalga said. “We are looking for
improvement against Pitt.”
Swalga returns a veteran squad

from last year. He boasts an expe- ’

rienced front line that features three
seniors. Leading the way is Missy
Walls from Quaker Valley. Walls
only scored four points against
Youngstown State, but, as Swalga
phrased it, “Missy did not play her
typical game Monday night.” i
Joining Walls on the front line is
fellow Quaker Valley product Carol
Dennison. The third senior is Kim
Mong, a 6-1 center from Warren,
Pa. Mong led the Colonial attack
against Youngstown State with 16
points. Rounding out Swalga’s
lineup are three quick guards that

especially with Johnnie's [Hnath]
performance, since it was his first
tournament victory, but also with
the freshmen’s performance.
Although none of them placed, they
did wrestle well for it having been
their first collegiate competition."
This year’s line-up is a relatively
young one, but that hasn't deterred
the team’s optimism. “Although we
are somewhat cautious with such a
young team, we are aware that with
youth comes enthusiasm and excite-
ment,” said Stottlemyer. “In the past
our dual meets carried a ‘business as

‘usual’ attitude, which proved detri- -
mental to our performance. It won’t

be like that this year, and we’re really
looking forward to the new
enthusiasm.”

Waynesburg does have some ﬁne
wrestlers," continued Stottlemyer.
“Yet, they aren’t Division 1, and that
may make somewhat of a
difference.” ‘

This will be a challenging season
since the Panthers are competing in
the respectable Eastern Wrestling
League, which earned the title for
being among the three toughest con-
ferences in the country at the close of
last season.

“We’re real excited about the sea-
son,” explained assistant coach Jeff

towards them. The team spirit is
high, and each member is very deter-
mined, and that will help through-

Puskar and Diana Solomon and
sophomore Lee Repasky.

Saurer described Robert Morris
as a “quick” team that will run a
transition-type offense. She will
counter Swalga’s quickness with
some flash of her own. The Panthers
will be headed by senior scoring
machine Jennifer Bruce. Bruce led

all scorers last Saturday with 34'
points and is currently second on

Pitt’s all—time scoring list.

Joining Bruce on the front line is
sophomore center Jenny Tyner.
Tyner stands 6-5 and is the biggest
player in the Big East conference.
Playing opposite Bruce in the other
forward slot will most likely be
senior Ellen Gilhooley.

Passing specialist Kim Tirik will

seniors Stephanie Collins and Lisa
Fubio will see action at off-guard.
Off the bench, sophomore Jane
Plake scored 16 points against St.

vide instant offense once again.

All in all, it should be an interest-

Swalga will be _ looking for his
Robert Morris squad to come

track. Saurer and her Panthers are
looking to enter this weekend on a
confident note. They face the No. 1

It took a while — all of four impa-
tient minutes —- before Charles
Smith sank his first basket in his
collegiate debut. Not even that was
easy as the freshman forward drew a
lane foul early in the first half of the
Panthers‘ home-opening I04-88 vic-
tory over St. Francis Monday night.

» It was quite an inaugural start for
the I-0 Panthers, treating 4, 145 Fitz-
gerald Field House fans to an assort-
ment of goodies. Five players hit
double-figure scoring, Chip Wat-
kins displayed an outside shot that
might earn him a permanent spot
ahead of Andre Williams, and the
motorman from Detroit, Demetreus
Gore, wasted no time in presenting
his slam-dunk clinic.

But ' whatever happened to
defense? ‘

“We had some bright spots, we
had some bad spots,” Coach Roy
Chipman began. “You know, we
had a lot, a [or people out there,

happen. We had some great spurts in
the first half, some in the second

But by and large I was pleased.”

because I knew I wasn’t in the right
position,” Smith said. “I was just

waiting to get my chance. I knew I'd
be in there.”

With a little under three minutes
to go before the half, Chipman had
his substitution rotation in full
swing. The Panthers, by then,
dangled the 0-2 Red Flash by a
string, toying with 16- and I7-point
leads. Four times Pitt went on
unanswered, six-point rampages
before exiting with a 53-38
advantage.

Smith and Watkins led the
charge, scoring the bulk of their
points in the first 20 minutes. Before
foul trouble after the half sidelined
him, Smith canned 12 ofhis 16 while
Watkins hit on l4 of his night's l9

s points.

“Watkins had a great game, sim-
ilar to when we were recruiting him
in high school," "said Chipman, elic-
iting four-year-old memories.

“This was probably my best first
half,” said the senior from Louis-
ville, ignoring the word ever. “I
always knew I could score. Last
year, I didn't get a chance to shoot
because Clyde was there. Now we
can shoot more and I’m taking that
opportunity."

So did Gore, the Detroit freshman
who converted three steals in a first
half span of two minutes into electri-
fying dunks. He finished with eight
points over all and seemed headed
for double digits, too.

Until something happened.

“We had a great spurt in the first
half and we get everyone into the
basketball game and then we go into
the lockerroom and everyone thinks
the game’s over," Chipman said. “I
should’ve buried my head there fora
while.”

Pitt went from shooting over 60
percent from the field to barely
above 51 percent in the second half.

St. Francis turned what had been
a 19-point mountain with 4:07 to go
into a not-too-shabby ll-point
molehill. Forward Jeff Hamilton
scored 15 of his game-leading 24
points in the second half, right ahead
of guard Greg Jacobs’ l3 of 19
points.

Chipman then sat the free-
wheeling Gore and fellow freshman
Junie Lewis down, staying with
dependable Curtis Aiken and sur-
prise starter Joey David.

“I certainly wasn't happy with the
last three to four minutes,” Chipman
said. “That’s why I took the'fresh-
men out. Your ally is time and when
you’re beginning to throw the ball
up that’s how you lose the game. We
have to impress that upon [the
freshmen].”

“Unlike other games I’ve seen [St.
Francis] in in the past, they play
wide open," said Aiken, who led the
Panthers with 21 points and eight
assists. “I expected them to post
guys up. That’s our game. I was
really surprised to see them [running

of thing.” Smith was asked if it
always came easy.for him. Was he a
natural athlete or did he have to
work for every point? “I guess it was
easy for me," he said and as long as
he played for them, it was also easy
for his team. Smith played for pow-
erful Warren Harding High, win-
ning two consecutive state
championships and a No. 8 national
ranking from USA TODA Y. They
lost only once during reign_of King
Charles. “The loss was a different
feeling,” he said. “Very different:

But since we did lose that one time, I
think it helped our team because
after that game we won all the rest of
our games by at least 17 points.”

Still, it hasn’t been.completely
smooth sailing for Smith. Rumors
abounded last spring that he had
changed his mind about Pitt and
would instead attend Providence.

After a round of denials from Pitt’s
staff and Smith himself, nothing
more was said of the stories. “My
mother has been very supportive
through all this. My whole family
has, really. I’m satisfied with Pitt so
far but the season hasn’t started yet
—— so I don't know.” Pitt can only
hope he doesn't change his mind.

\Spiker’s kills spell ‘trouble for

opponents 3

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The drama‘s there, all right. It’s in
the quick set, the quicker jump and
the crushing blow that invariably
sends the ball whizzing over, around
and through the blockers’ out-

 stretched hands. Often the ball will

then smack thewaxed floor and spin
up and away, and another point is
scored by the Pitt women's volley-
ball team.

This type of crowd-pleasing
action is usually generated by 5-10
senior Ulana Kohutiak, whose con-
sistently powerful spikes have led to
Pitt’s outstanding season. The
Panthers are 30-7 going into the first
round of NCAA national cham-
pionships, where they will face No. 7
Nebraska on the Cornhuskers'court
this weekend.

Kohutiak’s contributions to this
team’s success are exemplified by
her ‘habitual selection to all-

tournament teams (seven), including’ i

being named tournament MVP four
times, as well as her record-setting
performances at the LSU Classic (33
kills) in October and in the Western
Michigan Classic (40 kills) this

- weekend.

“The most impressive thing about
her outstandingstatistics this year,”
said Coach Shelton Collier, “is that
every team keys on her and still can’t
stop her. She is consistently beating
two and sometimes three national
caliber, six-foo’t-tall blockers, and
she has impressed a lot of top-level
coaches across the nation. At times
she even amazes her teammates and
myself when she really hammers
one.” - -

The ball no doubt felt like a
hammer to Judy Barnes of Provi-

dence, who was forced to leave a
game after being hit in the face by

one of Kohutiak’s spikes. In the‘

team’s first tri-meet of the season,
Sandy Bachman of Duquesne also
fell victim to a powerful spike.

Kohutiak’s attack was not always
so intimidating. The Canadian-born
middle blocker says she has learned
a great deal since coming to Pitt. ‘‘I
grew up a lot, I learned a lot — how
to play volleyball, how to treat peo-
ple, how to move more efficiently,”
she said. “l‘ve learned how to be
gutsy and stand up for my rights.
Shelton’s done a lot of good things
for me-, but it hasn’t always been
good,” Kohutiak continued. “He
yelled a lot‘. As a freshman, I didn’t
know how to handle myself, but.I‘ve
learned respect and maturity, and
how to play American-style volley-
ball, which is technically different
from Canadian style.”

-Assistant coach Julie Gaul, who
was the team’s MVP two years ago
when Kohutiak was a sophomore,
believes Kohutiak’s improvement is
a result of four years of training and
competing with top-level teams.
“She has developed to her full poten-
tial,“ Gaul said. “Her roleon the
team is much more significant now,
although she played well in ’82. She
has matured a lot as an athlete and
can hit with anybody in the country
now. She has proven that with her
consistently outstanding play.”

Koliutiak says that a change in
living quarters helped her develop
into the person she has become.
“Living off campus, being able to
spend time alone, knowing it‘s my
last year — it’s a combination of
things,” she said. “I'm starting to
realize that I’d better get on the ball.
I’d like to leave accomplishing
something.“ » .

out with as a freshman is not here

- NEW YORK (UPI) —
Slugger Dave Kingman yester-

now; Judy Young was the team cap-
tain last season and was selected to
the first team All-Big East Confer-
ence. She would have captained the
team this season as well, but con-
tracted mononucleosis early in the
season and was redshirted. Young
will probably lead the team next
season. ’ _
Kohutiak said that athletes must
adapt to many different situations,
and losing a teammate is just one
of them. “Judy came a long way and
kind of grew up with the program,

starting with Shelton’s junior Olym- V

pic team. She is a great student,
leader and player.

“You have to adapt to missing
people; things must go on," Kohu-
tiak_ said. “You have to be willing to
be part of .a program. You have to
get used to having people leave and
dealing with injuries.

“Last year we were developing
and we were missing leaders,“Kohu—
tiak said of the disappointing season
Pitt had, ending with the loss to
Providence in the conference final.
The middle blocker could not pin-
point any one person as the team
leader this season, but mentioned
seniors Cathy Rupp and Pat Belcher
and junior Sally Gillespie as sources
of inspiration. She did not fail to
mention her own inﬂuence.

“People look up to you because
you do things right.” .

According to Collier, Kohutiak’s
role on the team is glamorous but
her teammates play equally impor-
tant positions. “Our team is unique
because Ulana gets a lot of notoriety
and carries a majority of the offen-
sive load, but our team accepts that.
On other teams that may cause a
problem but our players are team-
oriented.

“If our defense or setter didn’t do
theirjobs, then Ulana wouldn't look
good. A lot of credit has to go to

Cathy because they work well‘

together and that has contributed to
Ulana’s success.”

Pitt season sparks memories

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

“A Tale of Two Coaches"

It was the best of times. It was the
worst of times. It was I969. A year
that began as a triumph for one team
ended in disaster for another.

The New York Jets rejoiced as
Broadway Joe Namath’s guaranteed
victory became reality. The football
world was shaken as the Jets upset
the Colts in Super Bowl III, 16-7.

But there was no joy in Steelville,
the mighty Steelers had struck out.

Owner Art Rooney had hired a
complete incompetent to coach his
beloved Steelers.
without a champion, it appeared
that this coach would uphold that
“tradition." He spoke of strange and

new ideas, unheard of in profes-

sional football. He spoke of weight

' a training and a total commitment to

youth. He spoke of sacriﬁcing the
present to benefit the future. He
spoke of expected failures in the
beginning. But he also spoke of a
championship in five years. He was
given those five years. He delivered.

In 1969, the Steelers ﬁnished with
a 1-13 record. The defense, despite
the presence of Joe Greene (pro

‘football's greatest defensive lineman

ever) and L.C. Greenwood (possibly
a future Hall-of-Famer), set some
less than enviable records. In that
season, the Steeler defense allowed
more points (404), more TD’s (50),
and more first downs (260) than at
any time in their miserable history.

This coach's record over the next
two seasons was ll-l7 despite the
presence of players like Terry Brad-
shaw, Jack Ham and Mel Blount.

Despite a three-year record of 12-
30, this coach was allowed to con-
tinue. He eventually went on to
prove his plan worthy as he won four
Super Bowls over a six-year period.
His name  Chuck Noll.

Oh how weak the memory! It is 15
years later and the fans of Pittsburgh
are asking for the head of a coach
who has achieved so much more in
his first three_ years than Noll.

Admittedly, this coach took over a
more successful] program than Noll,
but he has faced problems too.

In this coach’s initial season, QB
Danny Marino was to be the focal
point of the team. Trying to live up
to superhuman expectations, he fal-
tered. But despite a poor perform-
ance by the man who was to be the
central ﬁgure of the team, the Pan-
thers finished the season with a 9-3
record and a Top Ten ranking.

The next season, the Panthers
finshed with an 8-3-1 record that
belied their performance. The tie
came against Penn State, preceding
a loss to Ohio State. The history of
those two schools speaks for itself.
Another loss came against WVU, a
rival who Pitt had defeated nine of
the last ten times. The remaining loss
came against Maryland. I guess this
coach was supposed to be God and
never suffer an upset. The three
losses were by a grand total of 14
points. _

How soon we forget! One bad sea-
son for the Panthers and “F ogebus-
ters” come crawling out of the
woodwork. But Coach Foge Fazio
has remained calm:

“Nine months ago I received an
extension of my contract to make it
a five-year contract. I’m going by
that. I don’t need a vote of conﬁ-
dence. I accepted it as that.”

How    
to watch
a  meet  

By Keith Yanessa
The Pitt News

(Thousands of students regularly
spend fall afternoons in Pitt Sta-
dium and warm’ their hearts in Fitz-
gerald Field House on cold winter

-nights watching the basketball team,-

but the one Pitt team that is truly
outstanding plays to nearly empty
bleachers. That one team is the Pitt
men's swim team.

Okay, you say, they may ‘be good,
but swim meets are as boring as
chemistry lectures. That may seem
to be the case only because the aver-
age fan does not know what to look
for at a swim meet. Nor does he
know who to look for while the
swimmers are on the blocks. Was
any real sports fan. bored by the

‘ swimming at the Summer Olympics?

If you were, check your pulse.
Fans who ‘do attend the meets

seem to think the diving events are a

signal to go out and get a Coke or

' smoke a cigarette. This article is for ‘

you, sports fans.’ Welcome to the
world of college swimming. '
First of all, get a good seat. A.
good seat consists ‘of a clear view of ‘
the starting blocks. It’s not as if you
won't be able to find one. Before the

meet starts, get to know who is '

swimming by studying the program.
Also get a good ‘look at the score-

~ board so you will know how to read

itonce the meet gets underway.
Anticipation builds in the natato-
rium, and a scratchy version of the
national. anthem is piped over the.
loudspeaker. The teams are intro-

’" duced; the first event is announced.-

At Trees Hall, eight lanes are nor-
mally in use during a race. Each
team- has three or four swimmers in
each race. The swimmers from each
team ‘alternate lanes with the best
swimmers occupying lanes four and
five.

Diving is an event that combines
tremendous athletic skill with grace
and style. At Pitt, two divers have

“already qualified for the NCAA pre-

qualifying meet.
