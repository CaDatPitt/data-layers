Quick Fix:

By Tool) ERKEL

If shoppers along Forbes
Avenue have been surprised by
the recent burgeoning of conven-
ience stores in the area, consider
the owners of those stores who
are now asking the question: Can
Oakland provide enough late-
night hunger to support four
such businesses in a five-block
area? _ .
Students and other people in a
hurry now will have to take the
time to decide where they will go
for their quick food fix with three
new convenience stores moving
into the Oakland area, a market
that has proved successful for the
? 7-ll chain.

Although both the Sheetz and
Stop-N-Go stores opened within
‘ one day of each other, andithe
Uni-Mart (located at the corner
of Forbes Avenue and South
Craig Street) opens today at
noon, none knew the others
would be coming into the area
until after they aquired their
respective properties.

“They [7-l l] have been doing
extremely well, and so we made a
choice to open here,” Steve '
Sheetz, vice president of Sheetz
Inc. said. “Right after that, we
found out that Stop-N-Go was
going in. I'm not sure everybody
knew each other was coming in.
It is a problem that we have all
decided to [arrive] at the same
time."

Both Sheetz and Jim Bruce,
vice-president and chief operat-
ing officer for Stop-N-Go Inc.

Shoo 

expressed concern that the new
kids on the block may not have
given themselves enough room.
“If you were going to give me a
choice, I would rather be the only
[store] on the block,” Bruce said.
“I really do not know whether we
can support that many in a small
area. It will be interesting."
Whether a victim of opening
day optimism or just far enough
away from the competition,

Housing Tax Dodge:

By MIKE aucsxo

The housing market around some
American universities is being tar-
geted by contractors building multi-
unit housing projects with specific
buyers in mind: students and their
parents.

This happened at two universities
in particular: Clemson University in
South Carolina and the University
of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
Private contractors build housing
units and parents seeking tax deduc-
tions buy the units, rent them out

3,-_':»r;l. defray the cost of their child-
'ren’s education.

The practice has not surfaced
here, according to spokesmen at
area colleges, although it has been
rumored to be occurring at
Carnegie-Mellon University. Offi-
cials at Pitt and Duquesne Univer-
sity said they had not heard of the
practice, but could neither confirm
nor deny its existence. .

Jeff Rutkowski, head of CMU'
Off-Campus Housing Office, said
there has been talk around the uni-

versity about the tax dodge.
“We’ve talked about it in the uni-

versity, but how prevalent it is, I

don‘t know," he said. I'm sure it

happens.”

According to Richard McKenzie,
an economics professor at Clemson,
the tax dodge works like this:

Parents in higher income brackets
buy property (houses, apartments,
townhouses, or condominiums)
around the college their child will
attend. Since the parents are in a
high tax bracket, the amount of
deductions allowable on taxable
income is substantial if the property
is claimed as “rental property." -

For example, if a parent buys a
home $55,000 at 12 percent and bor-
rows 80 percent of the purchase
price, deductions for the first year
will total approximately $5,280. The
deduction is from interest expense,
and if the parent violates the tax
code by renting the property to their
child and claiming it, depreciation
allowances can be deducted at an
accelerated rate as well.

This means that the total deduc-
tion for a year would be $7,333

Uni-Mart, thinks her store will
not be affected by the arrival of
the others, nor does she attribute
Uni-Mart’s entry as a reaction to
anyone else’s success.

Uni-Mart began its operation
in State College in the shadows

has had good success since in

University, DEC
Reach Agreement

Professor Norman Bardsley,
chairman of the Pitt Task Force on
Academic Computing (PITTFAC),

'announced the completion of the

committee's preliminary report on
the university's computing needs at
Monday's Senate Council meeting.

The task force has been examin-
ing the practical computer applica-
tions of both university-wide text

processing users as well as heavier‘

users in the computer science
department. A recommendation on
final expenditure and effort concen-
tration is forthcoming.

“If everyone in the university got ,

what they told us they wanted, it
would cost Pitt over $34 million,”
Bardsley said. “Our job, along with
the Educational Policies Committee
and the Computer Users Commit-
tee, is to help make some important
decisions that will affect the whole
university."

The use of computers at Pitt con-
tinues to change even while PITT-
FAC conducts its study. Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC)
approved two recent proposals sub-
mitted by the university; one pro-
vides for a 60 percent discount on
the purchase price of 50-100 new
CRT terminals, the other gives the
go ahead for a co-research project
that would match $5 million in Pitt
funds with $5 million from DEC.

The addition of the new CR1’ ter-
minals has madeit possible to begin
to phase out existing card-punch
facilities. In the near future, only one

.key-punch will be available per

Remote Job Entry (RJE) site on
campus.

Plans for the new, privately-
owned computer store, similar to the
one operating at the University of
Colorado, which provides discounts
of 30 percent to university patrons,
have been implemented, and the uni-
versity is currently securing the
necessary loan funding, according to
council president Richard Tobias.
Although the university will have no
direct investment in the enterprise,
several lines of personal computing
will be available to faculty, staff and
students.

In other business:

Senior vice-chancellor J.E. Free-
man gave an informal report on
expected budget problems of the
next few years. Freeman revealed
that cuts of 3-8 percent have
occurred in most departments since
I976 and that tuition has increased
an average of 5 percent in constant
dollars since 1973. ‘Freeman
expressed a need for /caution as the
university makes its future financial
decisions but added, “We are not on
a downward toboggan ride so much
as a roller-coaster ride that must be
ridden with great care."

The Senate Educational Planning
Committee listed the qualifications
they are looking for in a new univer-
sity provost.

Plans for further automation of

the university library systems will

culminate in January, 1984, The
university assumed management of
the Falk Ambulatory Care facility,
now part of the Presbyterian Uni-
versity Hospital on July 1.

College of General Studies Dean
Dr. John Baldwin and Dean Jerome
Martin of the Health Related Pro-
fessions were welcomed.

Is It Happening In Oakland?

which translates into $287 per
month. With the added deduction of
property taxes, the parent would
pay iittie or nothing for the prop-
erty, thus saving the cost of housing
for their child while he or she is in
college.

Mcxenzjc said sets of parents
have been known to buy property
and then rent the space out to each
others’ children, creating an even
larger tax write—off. _ '

The tax incentive is creating a
two-fold problem at these Southern
universities: the wealthier students
moving into parent-owned housing
has relegated dormitory space to the
lower-iﬁcomﬁ students, and the
large number of students moving off
campus has caused vacancies in uni-
versity housing.

The cost of tuition and housing
may be a factor for the tax dodge
turning up atCMU is $3,150. Tuition
and housing at Pitt combined is
$4,l49.

since the practice takes place
between real estate offices and par-
cuts, university officials may be in
the dark about its presence in this

area. However, Lewis Schwartz, co-
owner of Oakland Real Estate, said
he had not heard of the practice
either.

The class barrier that is forming in
the Southern universities because of
the wealthier students moving off
campus apparently has not affected
this area either. University officials
say if the practice is occurring here,
it is not causing a shortage in univer-
sity housing.

“I have a waiting list of 350 peo-
ple,” Robert Robinson, assistant
director of housing at Pitt, said. “I
think he [McKenzie] is a little off-
base, as far as I'm concerned."

Robinson said real estate offices
around Oakland try to match the
cost of university housing and the
$773 Pitt charges per term fora dou-
ble room can be met more easily
when the payments are broken down
into monthly installments.

“People with less money tend to
go off campus because the university
charges one lump sum," Robinson
said.

Clemson's McKenzie said the
practice tends to be localized and

would probably affect a rural area
like Clemson before it would be
found on urban campuses such as
Pitt or CMU.

“It's not one of those things that’s
busting out all over," he said. “It
may have not creeped up there yet.”

  Features

Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival

The Bard is alive and well on
the ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral
of Learning—in the form of the
Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival. '

The festival is produced by
Pitt’s department of theatre arts
and is held at the Stephen Foster
Memorial Theatre. The perfor-
mances begin in June and run
through August. Henry IV, Part,
I started the season off this year.
Currently, the company is per-

forming Much Ado About ,

Nothing and Othello, which is
the seasons’s final performance,
begins in late July.

The yearly plays that are per-
formed are chosen by the execu-
tive producer of the festival,
Buck Favorini, with the help of
others within the Theatre Arts
Department.

The day -of the final dress
rehearsal before the opening of
Much Ado About Nothing was
like the day of a ﬁnal examina-
tion.

Although the actors studied,
rehearsed and felt as if they
knew they play inside out, there
were still some doubts and ques-
tions‘in their minds.

The day before the play
opened on July 9, there were still
many questions still unans-
wered: What color should they

‘ re-order programs in if they ran

out? There were also minor
questions, like about a certain
prop. All of these questions had
to be asked before opening
night.

Much Ado About Nothing has
been changed from the tradi-
tional performance. Instead of

taking place in Elizabethan Eng-
land, the set has been changed
to America in the carefree 1920s.
Associate Producer Ned Read
said the new setting may dis-
courage some from attending
the play, but it might also
encourage others who do not
necessarily like Shakespeare.

‘‘It also might attract people
who are turned off by the tradi-
tional Shakespeare,” ‘Read said.
“Anytime a play is done, the
director has a vision; a concept
for that play. This setting com-
plements [Director Gillette]
Elvgren’s vision.”

The festival is professional by
all standards, and it’s not easy to
become a participant in one of
the plays. Students from all over
the country competed, and a
select number auditioned in New
York and Chicago. Read said
over 200 people auditioned in
Pittsburgh alone.

Most of the actors and
actresses are professionals;
many are members of the City
Theater Company and other
Pittsburgh acting groups.’ Only
five are Pitt students.

There is deﬁnitely an increase
of interest in Shakepeare in Pitts-
burgh, Read said, and this is sub-
stantiated by the growing
number of subscribers in the
past four years.

There has been a 50 percent
increase in subscriptions sold
each year since the festival
began. In 1981, 1,200 subscrip-
tions were sold. This increased
to 1,800 in 1982 and to 3,000 this
year.

Last year, approximately
20,000 people saw the three

The Bardls Alive And Well

plays and Read expects about

25,000 people this season.

The budget for this year's fes-
tival is $335,000. It will meet
about three-quarters of its costs
through ticket sales, souvenirs
and advertising. The additional
quarter will be met through pub-
lie and private contributions.

The festival has been in the
black each year except 1981
when it suffered a deficit, but
Read said things look “very posi-
tive” financially for this year.

An added attraction at this
year's festival is English actress
Claire Bloom who will perform
These Are Women: A Portrait of
Shakespeare’s Heroines this

. weekend.

Read said Bloom's appear-
ance is “an indication that the
festival is expanding and the cul-
tural impact it has on
Pittsburgh.”

With its increase in popularity,
Read said he finds that people
still prefer Shakespeare’s come-
dies over hislother works.

“Shakespeare isn’t really dif-
ferent from any other kind of
play,” he said. “Comedies are
always the most popular. People
want to have fun. They like to
laugh and have an easy, fun
time.”

To celebrate the opening night
of each of the plays and to
further promote the idea that it is
a festival, a Renaissance Fair is
held on the lawn of Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial Theatre. The fair
enables theatre goers to meet
the actors, and get a taste of the
Renaissance period in English
history.

Claire Bloom -

Bloom Comes To Pitt

peare’s Heroines as part of the
Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival.

Bloom’s appearance at the
Three Rivers Shakespeare Festi-
val marks the first event in a
Great Performers Series.

“Pittsburghers have rarely had

actors and actresses performing
in legitimate or classical drama,”
executive producer Buck Favo-
rini said. “We want to provide



ti-‘IA

ters from many of his works.

Born in London, Bloom made
her first stage appearance with
the Oxford Repertory Company
at the age of sixteen. A year later,
she played Ophelia in her first
major role at Stratford-upon- ‘
Avon opposite the alternating
Hamlets of Paul Scofield and
Robert Helpmann. In addition
to her roles in Shakepeare's plays
both on stage and on the BBC,
Bloom has also starred in other
English and American movies.

Performance times for These
Are Women, are Saturday, July
16, at 2 p.m., Sunday, July 17, at
8 p.m. and Monday, July 18, at8
p.m. Tickets for all performances
are $15.

Following the Monday night
performance, the festival will
honor Bloom at a reception. A
limited number of prime orches-
tra seats are begin held at ticket 
prices of $30 per person, which ‘
includes the reception where
patrons may meet Bloom.

General stores here in October of
1982.

The college market has proved
successful for all the convenience
stores, new and old, in the area. ‘
Two of the more successful Stop-
N-Go stores are those on the
campuses of Syracuse University
and the University of Michigan,
according to Jim Bruce, vice-
president and chief operating
officer for the corporation.

While’ the success of the 7-11
store—located in heavy foot traf-
fic between Hillman Library and
the Pitt residence halls—~may not
have been Uni-Mart’s primary
reason for entering the market,
the opening of three convenience
stores at nearly the same time
exceeds coincidence.

“We have a captive audience,
and with the number of people
that are there, we would be very
upset if we were not successful,"
said George Payne, district man-
ager of the Oakland store. “Nat-
urally, everybody is going to go
to the new kids on the block and
try them out, but I think we can
get them back.” .

Bruce thinks that product var-
iety will ultimately decide who
can survive in the market. The
three new stores all have deli
facilities and Sheetz even offers
its customers parlor style ice
cream.

“Right now we are limited; we
can’t go anywhere,” Payne said ’

of any future expansion plans for

might be a possibility down the
road but I do not know what the
situation is with anyone else‘s

Sheetz Inc. has plans to
further take advantage of the stu-
dent population by opening a
Sandwich Saloon-—a combina-

“ tion restaurant and take-out beer
shop—in the basement of their
current location, pending appro-
val of their application for a
liquor license.

Originally,
plans to open a restaurant on the
-location at 3725 Forbes

Restaurant——but then decided
against the idea. Company offi-
cials at Pizza Hut would not
comment on the planned move
into Oakland, but Michael
Khalil, owner of the building,
confirmed that Pizza Hut was
interested enough to have archi-

tectural drawings made up and ’

even make an offer to buy the
property, which Khalil declined.

Khalil then rented the site to
Sheetz lnc., entering into a 20-
year lease agreement (ten years
with the other ten optional),
which will bring him monthly
rent of $6,000. Khalil decided to
close the Forbes Avenue restau-
rant because he felt he was only
competing with himself by tak-
ing customers away from his two
other restaurants, particularly
the Baum Boulevard location.

‘will be sending two representatives
to the 65th annual National Urban
League conference being held in
New Orleans, La., Julyi3l through
August 4.

BAS chairman Daryll Davis and
deputy chairman Greg Ray were
elected as Pitt’s representatives to
the conference which will bring
together Urban League chapter
membersfrom across the United
States.

A series of panel discussions and
speeches will be conducted under the
conference -theme, “Building
Stronger Communities Together.”
The delegate assembly, the control-
ling body of the National Urban
League, will gather on the third day
of the conference to vote on pro-
posed policy changes and programs
for the upcoming year as well as to

members will be attending many of
the conference discussions in the
hope of bringing back with them
information and materials that can
be used by student groups and uni-
versity departments such as the
black studies program.

Invitations to the conference were
extended to BAS and all such organ-
izations that might benefit from the
conference. Pitt has been sending
representatives to the conference
since 1976.

will not have that many this year.
For instance, the Pittsburgh ‘chapter

 Healthy  
Changes

Last week the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
employers may not pay smaller monthly pension
benefits to women than to men on the basis of longer
average life expectancies for women. The court noted
that individual women might otherwise be short-
changed because of a characteristic true only of a class.

Opponents of this reform have wasted no time in
criticizing the decision. A common warning is that the
economic benefits from ending sex discrimination in
any insurance scheme——including pension plans—will
not measure up to some feminists’ expectations.

Employers, they reason, will not raise women’s pen-
sion payments to match what men now receive; instead
they predict that both men’s and women’s benefits will
be adjusted to meet somewhere between their present
levels.

Some warn further that the court’s ruling will infect
other kinds of insurance, for example, better aggregate
driving records mean lower premiums for women, but
congressional or court action may change that.

These objections mourn nothing but the demise of
unfair advantages; they have the bitter taste of sour
grapes. The arguments point to the economic side-
effects of the Supreme Court’s decision, and label
them as undesirable. But these side—effects are far from
undesirable. But these side-effects are far from unde-

sirable; in fact, any elimination of unfair practices in _

our economy must have real economic consequences.

Whenever unfair political or social structures are
overthrown, the unfair distributions of goods they
allow will also be discarded, to be replced by other,
more fair patterns. So with the elimination of inequi-
ties in insurance, some shifting of burdens and benefits
is inevitable, and educated guesses can be made about
what is to come.

The real economic gains that must be the mileposts
of our move toward a just equality between the sexes
have to come from somewhere. Since the economic pie
cannot be enlarged at will, those who have benefited in

the past from unfair treatment of others must expect a ‘

smaller slice in the future.

For the most part, this means that men will get less
as women get more. For the same reason, women
cannot expect soon to reach the economic levels men

’ before obtained because those levels could only be

supported by discrimination against women.

These adjustments in the way of economic costs and
benefits are shared will be the constant companions of
a shrinking gender gap, so they should not be regretted
or avoided. Those who warn against them display a
false concern for the interest of women, for these are
signs that our work toward equality has affected eco-
nomic reality. They are signs of health.

Prime-Time Politics

By KATHERINE M. BEZAK

The primary purpose of the
American presidential campaign is
not to inform voters of the
qualifications and backgrounds of
those running for office, but rather,
to serve as a lavish advertising
campaign designed to “sell” the
public on one slickly packaged
product over another. Catchy
slogans, testimonials, doubletalk
that requires a translator to be
understood and opinion polls
indexed by age, sex, marital status
and occupation are used to sell not
only. soap ﬂakes and pantyhose, but
presidential hopefuls as well.

It makes little difference who the
candidates themselves are, as long as
they can remember lines and speak
in public, for they are merely goods
to be sold. Almost every word they

utter is written by someone else,‘

their opinions on matters domestic
and international are formed by a
committee and whether they are
conservative, moderate or liberal
depends upon whose vote they are
courting.

Campaign promises and party
platforms are used to brand each

candidate with distinguishable
attributes, much the same as blurbs
for various colas allow the American
consumer to distinguish between
soft drinks. The importance of these
promises and platforms lies in the
way each candidate uses them before
election day to convince voters that
he is the best qualified to be
president. Record shows, however,
that after the election, campaign
promises and party platforms are
seldom referred to and have little to
do with the president’s actual
policies.

The media plays a crucial role in
the packaging of presidential
contestants. It provides space and
air time for debates and paid
political announcements, covers
those three ring circuses known as
conventions and, in an attempt to
remove some of the boredom from
the lengthy process of counting the
votes, television networks create
ﬂashy graphics and special effects
for election night coverage — the
videos are pleasing to the eye, give
instantaneous results, and are
untaxing upon the brain of the
average viewer.

Under the guise of newsworthi-
ness, syndicated columnists and
network commentators feel duty-
bound to interpret every syllable
that leaves any candidate’s mouth,
thereby insulting the intelligence of
the voting public while at the same
time imparting absolutely no useful
information. If the presidential
campaign is America's longest,
costliest and most boriirg
commercial come-on (and it is), then
the nightly news and daily papers are
its round-the-clock P.R. agents.

The average American consumer
chooses almost any particular prod-
uct not on the basis of which brand is
the best quality for the money, but
on the criteria of which has the most
noticable and attractive package,
the snappiest jingles and slogans, the
most familiar name, the most
impressive testimonials or which
denotes the most status. Apparently
those responsible for the
organization of the presidential
campaigns, from the candidates
themselves to the members of the
press, expect voters to select their
president in the same way. Perhaps
the American public, by virtue of its
silence, is saying it agrees.

Tax Credits Defended

Dear Editor:

lt seems strange that the writer of
an editorial in a student publication
sponsored by a non-public,
although‘ state-related, university
would react so vehemently against
tax credits to parents who send their
children to private schools. The very
same arguments you offered against
tax credits could be used against
Pitt’s receiving ﬁnancial aid from
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and the federal government.

in addition, the arguments you
presented are not logical. At last in
some private schools, higher quality
education is offered at lower cost.
Surely, the tax exemption would not
meet the cost of educating a child in

schools.

In some of the countries whose
iducational systems are said to be
superior to ours, even church-
related schools ar supported by the
state. I realize, hoaever, that all var-
tables are not taken into considera-
tion when charges of inferiority are
levelled against American -
education.

Why would the tax credit plan be
racially unfair? Many racial minor-
ity pupils are already in inner city
private schools because their parents

A recognize quality education. Minor-

ities would.have more,options.

Most people agree that monopo-
lies tend to reduce quality and raise
prices. Stating that the tax exemp-
tion plan would increase healthy
competition is not an “earsfull of
rhetoric" as you suggest.

None of us wants to see our public _

school system hurt. However, many
parents do not want to have their
children bused long distances each
day. Also, justice seems to dictate
that parents who are concerned
about such problems as substance
abuse and classroom disruptions by

school should not have to pay twice
for the type of education they have a
right to select for their child in a
-democratic society. It seems to me
that tax exemption plans are based
on both common sense and justice.

ALBUM
Joan Iett & The Blackhearts
MCA

You gotta admire Joan Jett.
She couldn't get a record com-
pany to sign her for years, peo-
ple told her she'd never be a hit,
and, worse yet, they even made
fun of her make-up ("she looks
like a pubescent hooker”). But,
she kept plugging away, touring
almost non-stop back and forth
across several continents,
believing that an audience is the
best judge. Of course, we all
know about the great success
that followed—the number one
song, smash album and sold-out
concert dates. But, unlike many
other one-hit wonders, she
didn't back down and rest on her

 
"Pills And Soap"I"Pills And
Soap”

The Imposter
IMP Records (import only)

Remember Elvis Costello's

, Get Happy album from a few

years back? One of its 20 songs
was "The Imposter": "he's not
the man you think that he could
be...." Well, Elvis Costello is out
again, and masked this time. His

_ _‘ 45 r.p.m. release features a new
  identity — The Imposter— as

well as the new song, "Pills and
Soap.”

It's a good tune, par Costello,
melodic but tense. The sparse

musical frame consists of‘

slightly B—movie keyboards and
a persistent rhythm track
sounding like safety matches
scraped repeatedly against an
abrasive surface.

The music is wrapped around
a somewhat cryptic barb that
pokes at ambitious and
unscrupulous journalists capi-
talizing on misfortune with"the
microphone in one hand and the
checkbook in the other.”

"Give us our daily bread in individ-
ual slices/And something in the daily
rag to cancel any crisis," he says.
The solution? "Give me the needle,
give me the rope/We're going to melt
them down for pills and soap."

The long version on the flip
side isn't noticeably extended,
although some vocal ‘harmonic
bridges are worked into it. The
Imposter's "Pills and Soap" is a
good effort altogether, but since
Costello can't disguise his voice
or style, why the musical sun-
glasses? Legal hassles with his
record company in England is
the answer (he's been barred
from releasing records under
his own name). But it doesn't
matter what name's stamped on
the sleeve —— this is still an
arrestingly original effort by an
artist who hasn't lied to us yet.

GROOVES IN ORBIT

NRBQ

laurels; indeed, she picked up
the pace again with yet more
touring and working on this,
her latest album. Lazy she's not.

So now that all the good stuff
has been said, let's get down to
things like talent, artistic talent,

which Jett and her band are'

lacking. Her songs, for the most
part, are throwaways, simple
boy-girl-lust fluff backed up
with even simpler, near—heavy
metal arrangements. The deliv-
ery is precise and calculated, but
still poor—the songs can only
sound the same for so long
without getting boring, and
that's just what Album is-
boooring. There's little differ-
ence between this lp and her
first two ("Crimson and Clover
on the last effort, an exact
replica of Sly Stone's ”Everyday
People” here) is -the vocals. Jett
“never did have a good voice—
she relies on screaming when
she can't hit the notes, which is
often—but now, after all the
touring, it's worse than ever.
When she tries to sing a slow,
sexy line, she comes off sound-

the other canines’ respect

because, on any given day, that
mutt could kick every dog's ass
in the neighborhood. That mutt
is NRBQ.

This band makes their own
brand of American mongrel
music that's not quite R&B and
not quite rockabilly. No, it's not
quite anything to be sure, but
it's damn catchy and unique as a
chihuahua with a pleasant dis-
position. There are times when
NRBQ’s style brings back
memories of Lowell George's
Little Feat, but that's about as
close as any‘ other band, dead or
alive, could get.

Grooves In Orbit is not NRBQ’s
first album, but it is their debut
on Bearsville which indicates,
once again, that Todd
Rundgren's label knows quality
when it sees it. However, the
chances that NRBQ will see
major FM airplay are slim — this
band is too music—oriented to
worry about selling a single and
too unpredictable to ever be
considered chic.

Still, NRBQ cannot be writ-
ten off because they're unmar-
ketable. No, in fact, in a time
where success can be ‘deter-
mined by the brand of drum
machine one uses, NRBQ
stands as innovators of a new

ing like an example case of strep
throat.

Iett works hard for a living-
that’s not in question; but what

breed of music that's spontane-
ous, improvisational and quite
palatable. This group is one
mutt that doesn't need to put on
the dog.

IN YOUR EYES
George Benson
Warner Bros.

In Your Eyes is George Ben-
son's follow—up to last year's
double album, The George Benson
Collection, which no one could
afford at its high $14 list price.
His latest single album effort is
an engaging collection of mid-
tempo love songs that is similar
in its slick, sophisticated arran-
gements.

As for inventiveness, George
doesn't explore any new
grounds here musically or
vocally. He's still a masterful
guitarist, but with a limited
vocal range. He doesn't sound as
if he is in a stale formula rut,
though, thanks to the produc-
tion talents of Arif Mardin.
Mardin has worked with artists
such as Melissa Manchester
("You Should Hear...") and
Chaka Khan, and here he has
assembled the best session play-
ers around in contemporary
pop/R&B music: the members

or not all that work is worthy of

of Toto. These guys played,
wrote and helped arrange most
of the material here. There is
also production assistance from
Kashif on the hit ”Inside Love
(So Personal)." Kashif is a rela-
tively new talent, who has
already made a niche in black
music as an artist and as an
arranger. He brings to this cut
his smooth and easy synthe-
sized keyboards, the light but
forceful funk bass textured
with soulful harmonies.

Everything on the album
sounds good, especially side one
with another standout cut,
”Love Will Come Again"; Chaka
Khan provides the exciting,
shrill vocals in the background.
There are only two ballads on
this album and the duet with
Vicki Randall, "Late at Night," is
the better of the two because of
its intimate and mature lyrics.
There is nothing here for
George's jazz fans except the
straightforward instrumentals,
"Being With You" and "In
Search of a Dream."

George has been more
pop/R&B oriented lately and
this album, although listenable,
does not showcase his versatil-
ity as an artist at all. To expe-
rience the diversity of Mr.
Benson see him in concert or,
cheaper yet, pick up The George
Benson Collection; there's more of
a variety there.

“C/“ 30 hvgﬁt metﬂiﬂg

§D

By LINDA HENRY

The lights come up and on stage are
comrades returning home from
World War I; ladies are gossiping on a

~ manicured lawn, posed in gorgeous

1920's fashions. Is this Shakespeare?
The magic of this man is that, yes,
despite the change in style and set-
ting, his messages still ring true and
clear. The Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival is now showing a very origi-
nal version of Much Ado About Nothing.
It is a joy!

As in Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing
uses the stage where ordinary people
(actors) are playing roles that make

them seem bigger than life to show us-

characters who are constantly being
deceived by appearances. Director
Gillette Elvgren’s choice to set this
play in post World War I Italy during
the rise of fascism further illuminates
the horror of what can happen when
an entire society is obsessed with
images. T

On the surface here, there are 95
fabulous costumes designed by How-
ard Kaplan, elaborately detailed sce-
nery and properties by the diversely

ing by Norman Russell, and once
again, delightful music composed and
adapted by Christine Frezza (with
some original words by director
Elvgren). The number of songs and
dances in this show just about make
the musical with wonderful dance
numbers choreographed by Melanie
Smith. (One more production
member who often goes unnoticed,
but in a show this large and tightly
run deserves a special note, is stage
manager Richard Arvizu.)

With an excellent cast of 19 actors
and three musicians, all of whom
deserve recognition, it is necessary to
remind readers of one of the pitfalls
in the newspaper business: space. So,
without further ado, I will start with
the main characters and the informa-

tion that this show runs Tuesdays’

through Sundays until July 23 in the
Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre.
Often given the most ink in criti-
cisms of Much Ado are the formidable
characters of Beatrice and Benedick,
the wordsparring lovers who con-
trast the silliness of the surface affair
that takes place between Hero and

 

 

like, ”Not till God make men of some
other metal than earth," in response
to her uncle's wish that she should
find a good husband, Beatrice could
come across as a wise-cracking femi-
nist. Lisa Bansavage, although spar-
kling with this side of her character,
also shows us the guts of this witty
woman; the pain and frustration as
well as the spiritedness of a beautiful
woman with a clever mind born into a
world encrusted with machismo.
On the other hand there is dashing
Benedick, a professed bachelor who,
at times, sounds very much like the
ultimate male chauvinist pig. How-
ever, Daniel Southern lets his shy-
ness out to show the awkward
schoolboy coyness of Benedick when
he is by himself thinking of Beatrice,
setting us up for some truly tender
moments when the two finally come
together at the end of the play.
Holly Thuma gives such a comic
Betty Boop-like interpretation of
Hero that we don't care that this
woman is such a wimp — we simply
enjoy. And, it is hard not to have your
pants charmed off by Robert Martini

THE FALSE INSPECTOR DEW
by Peter Lovesey
Pantheon ,

It seems there was a real Inspector
Walter Dew, a detective for Scotland
A” rd who'd retired with an
impressive record back around 1910.
As part of Pantheon’s International
Crime Series, Peter Lovesey’s The
False Inspector Dew takes place in the
England of 1921.

Successful dentist Walter Baranov
and florist assistant Alma Webster
fall in love over the course of some
mouth work. The only fly in the
toothpaste is Baranov's wife, Lydia,
an actress on the far outskirts of her

ited fame. After another

I nsuiﬁessful audition, she decides to

try her luck in American motion
pictures. After all, she knew Charlie
Chaplin from his vaudeville days
when they'd played on the same bill.

”I am going to America," she says.
"My mind is made up." She books
passage _for two aboard the 5.5.
Mauretania, and her‘ husband finds

THAT CORPSE!

the red-headed former fiancee? The
Lockridges have followed a stylish old
recipe, but the old ones make the best
soup. There are half a dozen well-
motivated suspects stirred into it, lots
of red herrings and a satisfactory
(aha!) conclusion. "Very dirty bil-
liards," says Jerry, summing up 'a bit
of the villainy. The Judge Is Reversed is a
nice old-fashioned sort of mystery-
an excellent light reading snack.

 

MURDER BY THE BOOK

"We're sticks-in-the—muds, aren't

we?" asks Pam North.

"It's pleasant mud," responds Jerry
North.

But they can't seem to get entirely
away from the corpses. Dr. Edmund
Piersal partners the Norths and one
Rebecca Payne in a casual tennis
game; shortly , thereafter, Pam
discovers his body -— "done with
bleeding” — on a pier outside their
hotel. The local authorities are called
in, and Deputy Sheriff Ronald

logically from the Victorian period to
the 1940s.

Such little-known crimesolvers as
Loveday Brooke, Lady Molly of Scot-
land Yard, Violet Strange, Baroness
Clara Linz and Susan Dare find the
clues, assess the information and fin-
ger that crook in style. The collection
is offbeat and enjoyable, even for the
casual mystery reader, and some-
times compact crime just hits the
spot. Taste the vaguely romantic
"The Stir Outside the Cafe Royal”
with Miss Van Snoop or the bicycles-
and-murder in "Daisy Bell” with Bea-
trice Bradley. Mrs. Warrender is far
ahead of her "official" detective son
as she solves the missing silverware
caper in "The Mother of the Detec-
tive.” And don't miss "Snafu
Murder," the most recent story in the
set and one of the best, as Hildegarde
Withers figures out who did it: "In
addition to the heavy G.I. overcoat,

I fastened neatlyon the left-hand but-

tons, he wore a woman's silk stocking
tied cruelly tight around his neck.”

Biographical notes are included on
the authors represented in the collec-
tion, as well as brief histories of the
featured lady detectives, an introduc-
tory overview and a chronological
survey of women sleuths in fiction
for anyone interested in pursuing the
subject further. There must be some-
thing historically important about
Crime On Her Mind, but it offers some
fun, nostalgic reading as well.

GREEN GROW THE DOLLARS

shared by Mary Jane Latsis, an
agricultural economist, and Martha
Hennissart, a lawyer. They've also
been writing together since 1961, and
they've managed to combine all three_
professions in Green Grow the Dollars,
their 19th effort as a team and a good
suspense novel.

The well-known and respected
Vandam Nursery and Seed Company
plans to market Numero Uno, a new
tomato plant with the remarkable
ability to bear fruit for six months at a
time —— certainly a genetic miracle,‘
and one of considerable value.

Research was carried out by Dr.
Howard Pendleton at the Institute of
Plant Research in Puerto Rico;
naturally, Vandam's takes steps to
patent the discovery. Trouble crops
up literally in the form of Wisconsin
Seedsmen. Inc., a rival who claim
to have developed VR-117, a tomato
plant identical to the Numero Uno.
Scott Wenzel, Wisconsin's bright
young scientist, and his business
partner, Ned Ackerman, instigate
court proceedings against the
sizeable Vandam family.

Murder occurs in the middle of an
uncomfortable convention of plant
geneticists. The means are close at
hand — a brand of particularly lethal
yet easily obtainable plant fertilizer.

The old "who did it?" question is the '

mystery. Unofficially and rather
reluctantly, John Putnam Thatcher
takes it upon himself to look into the

_matter._ He uncovers amess of

theft and corporate scandal.

In roving style and traditional
mystery manner, Emma Lathen

jumps from character to character,.

creating a complex web of incidents
and a dizzying list of suspects,
motives and possiblities, much of
them misleading. Sorting out all the
names and relationships becomes
slightly confusing to the reader, but
Thatcher remains unflappable, a man
of common sense and even temper.
His role in the proceedings is very
secondary, however —— almost an
afterthought or a side dish — but he's
a likeable fellow, Green Growthe Dollars
is an effective suspenser-

THE JUDGE IS REVERSED
By Richard and Frances Lockridge
Pocket Books

Jerry and Pam North are married
and charming. He runs a book pub-
lishing firm; she likes crossword puz-
zles, and both enjoy cats and
martinis. They live in a Manhattan
apartment and know each other very
well. On oneside, they're detectives.
"Once," says Pam, trying to explain
their curious sideline, ”we found a

’ body in a bathtub. That's all there

was to it, really."

The Judge ls Reversed is a glamourous,
witty and enjoyable mystery co-
authored by another married couple,
Richard and Frances Lockridge. Their
characters of Pam and Jerry are an
z_1_f_ft§:,g:tionate pair, reminiscent of
Uashiell Hammet's Nick and Nora
Charles with their friendly banter.
The judge, in this case, is wealthy
John Blanchard, tennis tournament
referee and cat expert, and he is very
reversed early in the book, overruled
in fact. ”He had been struck on the
back of the head with a heavy object"
and was quite dead.

Who did it? Was it the angry tennis
pro or the eccentric veterinarian or

biggest piece of evidence is Dr.
Piersal's black notebook and its last
notation, written the evening before
his death. The solution hinges on the
book and the Hippocratic Oath.

How do people write as a team,
anyway? We may never know, but
Richard and Frances Lockridge suc-
ceed admirably. The Norths are enor-
mously likeable, and Murder By The
Book is a brisk and entertaining
mystery with a satisfactory
conclusion.

Greenberg’s Exit Steeped In Questions   

By scorr DELLETT

Trouble was brewing with the
.*Panther basketball program.

-P" "fegations of recruiting viola-

" tions. were making headlines in
the local papers. Pitt, the school
trying to fight the reputation of
having problems with athletes
had a new problem—or firing,
depending on which you believe-
of assistant basketball Coach
Seth Greenberg has blemished
the Pitt athletic department in
general and the basketball
program——the one making such
great strides towards national
prominence by joining the Big
East—in particular. Not only

 because of the charges of_ recruit-

. ing violation against the pro-
gram, but also because of the
mgway the hierarchy of the athletic

;partment handled the Green-
berg incident.

 

Wh

asports

In late April, Fairﬁeld coach
Terry O‘Connor accused Green-
berg of giving Center High
School recruit Marlon Ferguson
a 1.5 mile ride in his car, which is
a violation of NCAA rules. After
an_ in-house investigation, the
university turned their findings
over to the NCAA. When the
NCAA ruled Ferguson would
not lose any eligibility due to the
matter, he signed with the
Panthers.

During the reporting of the
Ferguson incident, head coach
Roy Chipman hit the media with
an off-the-cuff remark that Pitt
was being treated like another
UNLV. This didn’t sit too well
with Nevada-Las Vegas coach
Jerry Tarkanian, who said in an
April 30 article in the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette that a Pitt booster
paid for at round-trip ticket for
Paul Brozovich, a former Pitt
center who left school and is now
playing for Nevada-Las Vegas.

  

The report. said that Pitt was
questioning Greenberg for the
role he took in this matter.

Before these two incidents,
Greenberg was hailed as one of
the bright rising young coaches
in the game. In the 1982-83 bas-
ketball guide, Greenberg was
described as the key to the devel-
opment of the program. His
main achievement was recruiting
forward Clyde Vaughan away
from such established basketball
schools as DePaul.

But his aggressiveness and
drive got him into problems.
Greenberg was not a favorite
with the media, sometimes
responding bitterly to reporters’
inquiries, which may have con-
tributed to his downfall.

Perhaps the pressure of build-
ing a program worthy of the Big
East Conference caught Green-
berg.‘ After all, one can only live
on a major coup for so long.

And this is where the athletic

 

In submitting his resign-
ation, Greenberg said,

al and professional
reasons, and l’-mi in the ,

_ mldstot pursuing several ’ -
. other eareer..opportun-._‘~. ‘

department comes in. Joining
the Big East may have been a
blessing financially, but the pro-
gram didn’t have the talent to
challenge for the top spots in the
league, as they could in the East-
ern Eight.

Quality recruits were needed,
and the pressure could have been
put on the staff. Greenberg may
have been so motivated that he
was going to get that one player
that could put Pitt over the top.

Event that can be understood,
if not forgivable. The aspect of
Greenberg resigning on his own
violition is not.

Despite what the press release
said, Greenberg was pushed out,
the sacrificial lamb in the effort
to save face. Will the program be
placed on probation? Will the
athletic department kiss goodbye
$500,000——the amount of the
basketball television contract-
for a year or two?

That is for the NCAA to

. decide. But perhaps Pitt is saying

to them, “We got rid of the cause
of the problem. Give us mercy,
please.” '

Pitt may come out with a slap ‘
on the wrist by the NCAA. Even
if sanctions are not placed
against the basketball program,
the damage has been done. The
name of the university, one
which is trying to fight the imag-
ery of athletes flunking out or
out of control, is darkened.
considerably.

And Greenberg’s coaching
career, one which seemed so
bright (he was offered a similar
post at Michigan State with a
pay increase and his name was
mentioned as a candidate for the
head coaching job at his alma
mater, Farleigh Dickinson, this
year before the incidents) is now
in limbo, his name tagged like
one of _an outlaw.

Academic/Talented Mix Sought As Lewis Reorders Priorities

, ﬂy MARK A. SINDLER

He may not realize it, but Pitt
swimming coach Fred Lewis has
been involved in a numbers game the
last few seasons. It seems there has
been at least one player each season
that has been a thorn in the men’s

squad due to academic difficulties.

More specifically, there was ‘last
season's overall record of 6-2 that

could have read “undefeated " were it

not for dual meets with LaSalle and
an undefeated West Virginia team.

The Panthers lost to both schools by

one one-hundreth and 16 one-
hundredths of a second,
respectively.

This is all for the books,.and

 Lewis is not one for dwelling on

details, except to say that he is earn-

estly looking forward to a I983"-84.

season during which he believes the
Panthers will sweep the Big East and
maybe Easterns.

And he hopes to do it all with the
aid of at least six incoming freshmen

who have officially declared their
intent to power Pitt along its way.

“I was looking for kids with talent
and desire,” Lewis continued, “and
the academic ability to stay in
school. That was the primary thing I
was after.“

Again, Lewis is not one to name
names, except to say that he sought
to lure scholastic swimmers who not
only held their own in the water, but
were sufficiently buoyant in the
classroom as well.

History has already taken its toll,
no matter how much .or how little,
and Lewis can no sooner part with
yesterday's troubles.

“The past couple years, we've had
a few boys not make grades." Lewis
said. “lt‘s been a problem. They've
been world,-class athletes and of
Olympic-caliber right there. But they
didn't have the grades.

“Whether they had the ability or
just didn't want to do it, they didn't

make the grade, and this has left us
one man shy each—-which is a major

reason why we‘ve lost a few meets we
could‘ve won and we didn't win the
Eastern championship the last two
years.”

Despite past practices, Lewis now
eyes the future and its possible
rewards with a surging outlook.

“.1 can definitely say that we were
recruiting kids [in the past] that
might have been marginal students
and we knew that," Lewis stated.
“They had extremely good athletic
talent, where right now we're look-
ing for kids with extremely good
athletic talent and the academic
credentials.

“When it comes down to two peo-
ple with the same athletic caliber, we
can choose the one with the aca-
demicgcredentials now. We'll recruit
that person."

No one, not even Lewis, can pres-
ently predict what peaks his new
recruits will scale that past teams
had trouble climbing, but chances
remain high that a consecutive con-
ference championship is not ,out_of,
reach.

What is known is that Lewis did
not begin his recruiting ventures
with the intent of ﬁlling any holes in
his roster. Only the solid talent in
and out of the pool is what
impressed this coach, who will be
starting his sixteenth season in
September.

“l think we're at the point where
we can go out and recruit talented
kids, and not just people to fill the
spots.“

With three or four non-
scholarship swimmers expected to
also join Lewis’ squad, the following
six have been granted partial aid:

0 Richard James; Media, Pa.—~
backstroke and individual medley.

0 Tom Shaulinski; Freeport,
N.Y.——distance, freestyle.

0 Frank Williams; Hanover,
Pa.——breaststroke, individual
medley.

0 Rich Lucas; Wilkes-Barre,
Pa.~—breaststroke, individual
medley. ”

0 Steve Holland; Erie, Pa.—-
backstroke, freestyle. J

0 Keith Yanessa; Haverford,
Pa.—backstroke.

Lewis admitted that assessments

will have to wait until later in the ‘

year or at the beginning of '84 to
realize how effectively the freshmen
influence his squad.

One item remains a certainty,
though. If he sees his squad have a
“good year training-wise," "the
Panthers will easily advance to the
champions‘ circle in Easterns
competition.

“l know what their main strengths
were in high school, and we're going
to try to expand on them into the
collegiate levels and train from the
beginning for the Big East
championships, Easterns and
NC2As," Lewis said.

“And along the way,[the recruits]
have to develop or show tendencies
that they can be used in other areas,
and then we'll expand on that.” . .

Currently, Lewis pointed out,
each incoming freshman has at least
two‘ specialties acquired through
high school experience. But the
building will not end at that.
“We'll be looking for one more
[specialty] out of each,” Lewis said,
“and by working these three individ-
ual strengths in each person, that
means they can contribute three dif-

The Polish Connection....

Late last week, the Pittsburgh
Spirit announced, the signing of
Adam Topolski, 31, to a two-year
contract plus an option year. The
terms of the agreements ‘were not
disclosed.

The 5-1], l68-lb. Topolski was
named the Spirit’s Defenseman of
the Year in his rookie season ‘in the
MISL. He consistently drew the
assignment of marking the opposi-
tion’s top offensive threat.

Topolski’s cannon-like shot was a
valuable weapon for the Spirit as he ‘
scored ll goals and assisted on 10
others during the course of the 1982-
83 season. _He was also third on the
team with 45 blocked shots.

Lewis Reorders Priorities

the rest of these summer days wb

the New England Barracudas. Mar-
tin is just outside Philadelphia,
training with the New Jersey Wahoo
Swim Club.

Included in the sampling of those
staying on at Trees Pool under
Lewis‘ watchful eyes are Jeff Emore,
J.D. McCrillis and Mike Simon. All
are working out with the U.S. Swim
Club.

team, anywherelin Europe right

now. In my estimation, he can

become the best goalkeeper in the
MISL in a short period of time.”

Tack Up One More....

MISL commissioner Earl 1=<<.:-'e-
man has announced that Tacoma
has officially become a member or
the MISL. The franchise becayj}

iTacoma, Wash., recommended that
'a new MISL team become the prime
tenvnant in the newly completed
Tacoma Dome.

The world's largest wood-domed
arena can seat 23,786 spectators for
indoor soccer. This concludes the
competition between the North
American Soccer League’s Seattle
Saunders and the new MISL group
headed by John Best forthe rights to
obtain a lease in the Tacoma Dome
for indoor soccer.

“We are delighted,"
added, “with the ownership of mi?‘

newest franchise in the MISL.They._ \

represent outstanding leadersh'
both in the business and communal
mainstream of the Tacoma area.”

Foreman also stated that a team
in the Northwest fits well into the
MISL’s future plans for network TV
as well as national and regional
cable TV.

Best is a folk hero of sorts in Seat-
tle, which is 36 miles from Tacoma.
He was formerly the general man-
ager of the NASL’s Seattle Sound-
ers, until resigning four months ago.
Under Best's direction, the Sounders
had become a major force in the
NASL.

Ilnited Artists

A native of West Hartford,
Conn., Bourret received his bache-
lor’s in business administration from
Notre Dame in 1977 and his master’s
in communication arts from Notre
Dame in 1978. While at Notre
Dame, he served in the sports infor-
mation office as both a student
assistant and then as a graduate
assistant, editing the 1977-79 basket-
ball guides which won national
awards from CoSIDA.

After graduating from Notre
Dame, Bourret moved to Clemson
where he was assistant sports infor-
mation director until June 1980,

when he was promoted to associate
sports information director.

Among his accomplishments, he
has edited and designed all the bro-
chures and press guides for Clem-
son. Twenty-seven of those have
won national or state awards. Bour-
ret also served as the color
announcer for all Clemson basket-
ball, football and baseball games on
the Tiger radio network.

On the Sidelines...

Highly touted recruit Chuck Wil-
liams’ collegiate career may have
been put on hold before it has
started. The 6-6, 250-lb. defensive
lineman had surgery on his right
knee last Friday at Allegheny Gen-
eral Hospital.

Williams tore the lateral cartilage
in the knee during a Pennsylvania-
Ohio All-Star game at Reeves Sta-
dium in Beaver Falls. It is doubtful
that he will be able to play by
September.

Clyde Shines in Canada....

Last winter, Panther forward Clyde
Vaughan showed he could play in
the Big East, one of the best basket-
ball conferences in the nation. After
his performance in the World Uni-
versity Games, Vaughan showed the
world he could put the ball in the
basket.

Page 11

The 6-4 senior averaged 37.3
points per game in six contests as
England finished tenth in the com-
petition with a 5-2 record-
including one forfeit win.

Vaughan had a 37 point in a win
over Senegal and 34 in a loss to
Finland. A '

Marina Signs (Finally)...

Former Pitt quarterback Dan
Marino signed a multi-year contract
Saturday with the Miami Dolphins
after weeks of negotiations.

His signing came the day before
camp was scheduled to open for roo-
kies, Marino, who is Pitt’s all-time
leading passer with 8,416 yards, will
wear the familiar No. 13, the same
number he wore at Pitt and Central
Catholic High School.

Former Panthers Jim Covert and
Tim Lewis have still not signed con-
tracts with Chicago and Green Bay,
respectively. Both were first round
choices.
