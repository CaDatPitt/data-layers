Pope To Leave Pitt
After Eight Years
‘As Players Head

When Pitt Players ran.down the
ﬁnal curtain of “Dark of the
Moon” Saturday night, they also
played the last performance that
director Harvey J. Pope would
direct at Pitt.

A stunned group of actors, who
only moments before had been
jubilant over a packed house and
the largest three—day audience
since the same show was pro-
duced in 1949, heard director Pope
announce his departure from the
University. The announcement
came as Players completed the
most sucessful season, drama-
wise, since Pope came here eight
years ago.

Director Pope said that the
time has come for him to leave
the University. “We’ve reached a
high point in ‘Pitt Players and
there’s nothing more I can do,”
he said. He stated that the joint
efforts of actors‘ and technical
crew have attained an exceedingly
high degree of cooperationduring
this past season.

He gave no other speciﬁc
reasons for his. leaving, however.
He is considering other job offers

¢other leading seniors who have

. been honored through the years.

Given Annually
This award is given annually to
the senior man who most nearly
represents the type of student the
University aims to produce. Arid
honors awarded Dickinson since
he began school here have con-
tinued throughout his career.
In his sophomore year, Dick-
inson was named the Outstand-

.. ing Sophomore by Druids and

has been a leader throughout
his four years at Pitt.

Last year he was named Senior
Worthy, an award given to one
outstanding junior man and wom-
an. He was chosen for that honor
from 14 other juniors who were
named Junior Worthies.

Serves E&M Cabinet

He is a member of the Engi-
neering and Mines Cabinet, Druids,
YMCA, and AIIE. He is a former
vice president of Men’s Council
and is the president of Delta Sig-
ma Phi socal fraternity.

Dickinson played a major role
in the formation of political par-
ties at the University when he
chaired the “Pitt Party” coali-
tion. The prospective industrial
engineer served as treasurer dur-
ing the 1955 Religion-in-Life
program.

The 1955 ODK Awardee who
“walked” today was chosen to the
honor by a committee of students
and faculty after preferential bal-
loting had been conducted by male
seniors.

Weekly Chapel Services will
not be held today due to Tap
Day Ceremonies. They will
resume next Wednesday after-

. A prayer for guidance and a plea for money set prece-
dents in the second meeting of the newly elected Student

Congress attended by only a

quorum of members.

Student Congress voted appropriations of at least $210
to cover future expenses of both Men’s Debating Associa-

F tion and a proposed literary magazine.

Dave Guyol, member of the ﬁnancial staff of the

proposed literary magazine,

gave an outline of the ob-

jectives of the new publication and asked Congress’s
support for the ﬁrst issue which will be published only
if funds are allocated in advance.

On an amended motion by Betty:
Ann Young, the solons allocated

The allocation of $150 to the

Men’s Debating Association was
in answer to a plea made by Joe
Trattner, Col. ’55, to save debate

carrying Pitt’s name into competi-
tion. The members have been us-
ing their own funds for food and
lodging since the Notre Dame
debate.
Perri Debates Trattner

Another- oflast year’s solons,
John Perri-, entered nto a heated
discussion with Trattner, when he
felt that the financial assistance
would set a precedent that all
other school organizations might
attempt to follow.

Trattner caled MDA an “ex-
panding activity” that “differs
from the Pitt News, Owl, Band
and other organizations admin-
istratively” since it carries Pitt's
prestige with it as the “only
competitive intellectual activity
at Pitt, unless you can count
classes.”

Perri, in turn, lashed out at
MDA, with charges of inefficiency
in handling their original budget

-those in charge. Trattner listed an
impressive array of trophies, tour-
neys, «and television discussions
sponsored by the debaters to show
how they have expanded their

Bad Reactions
Aren’t Caused

By Salk Vaccine

Studies conducted in Pittsburgh
and Chicago have proved that the
Salk polio Vaccine will not cause’
allergic kidney ‘reaction or Rh
conﬂict in inoculated children.

Numerous clinicians had raised
the question of the new vaccine
causing kidney reactions in in-
oculated children, since the drug
was prepared from the kidneys of
monkeys.

Fourteen children at the Indus-
trial Home for Crippled Children
in Pittsburgh who had already
contracted polio or cerebral palsy
volunteered to test the vaccine.

They received large overdoses
of the vaccine over a period of
three months under the super-
vision of Dr. Franklin A. Neva,
one of Dr. Jonas Salk’s assist-
ants at Pitt, and Saverio Zuf-
fante, virus expert for the City’s
Health Department.

An around-the-clock watch was
maintained over the children dur-
ing this period by nurses and at-
tendants. After numerous tests,
the Salk vaccine proved absolutely
safe.

Dr. Albert Milzer of Chicago
conducted additional tests in that
area to determine if the Rh ‘factor
of the monkeys (all Rhipositive)
would affect the Rh negative chil-
dren who would receive the vac-
cine. Testing of 32 children ruled
out the possibility of conﬂict.

Other scientists had raised the
question of other possible after-
etfects, such as increased ab-
senteeism from school due to
minor illnesses tributable to vac-
cine.

Dr. Salk conducted tests on hun-
dreds of Pittsburgh school chil-
dren, half of them receiving vac-
cine and half receiving dummy
shots. Absenteeism showed a
marked reduction in the inocu-
lated children.

Buhl Foundation
Finances History

Of Western Pa.

A history of Western Pennsyl-
vania’_s pioneer developments in
industrial medicine, ﬁnanced by a
$15,500 grant from the Buhl Foun-
dation, will soon be published by
Pitt, Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald
announced recently.

This grant brings to approxi-
mately $500,000 the amount of
support the Buhl Foundation has
given the University over the
past several years.

The new history, “Industrial
Medicine in Western Pennsyl-
vania, 1900-1950”, will be written
by Dr. T. Lyle Hazlett, professor
of Industrial Hygiene.

Dr. Hazlett developed Westing-
house Electric Corporation’s pres-
ent-day «industrial medicine pro-
gram. He established the first de-
partment for that study at the
University;

He said this book is important
because: it will be a valuable

"That dang
chemistry."

Top Director  

“Standing room only” was given latecomers at Pitt
Players’ ﬁnal performance of the season last Saturday night.
as “Dark of the Moon” drew the largest attendance at Foster
Memorial since the same show set the all-time record in
1949. .
It was a ﬁtting tribute to a season that has witnessed
only success in both acting and technical ﬁelds. If there
was any doubt before last Saturday’s performance, it‘ Was
quickly dropped when the Tennessee Fantasy proved a
-Worthy show to end a memorable year. _

It is also a ﬁtting climax to the Pitt career ‘of director
Harvey Pope, although Players didn’t know until after the
show that this was his last. When he announced his de-
cision the last performance, actors and stage crew were
shocked. Not few ., tears were shed. _

They recognized, because they ve worked close to him,
the outstanding job that_Mr.. Pope has done. It will be a
difﬁcult task to replace him, in both talent and personality,
although his replacement will ﬁnd it a.mu_ch easier task
to step into Pitt Players than Mr. Pope did eight years ago.

_The quality of performance has.1ncrease_d year by year.
Some seasons, success was_ intermittent with shows that
rated only fair. But this past year a careful selection of

-plays, exacting casting of parts, and technical experience

brought this season to a" pinnacle of _presentation—due to
director Pope’s ability and interpretation.

As he himself said, “There’s nothing more that can _be
done.” For his successor the difficult task will be to main-

We regret that he could not stay at Pitt. Weoffer our
thanks for the job he has done and wish him good luck 1

Special Day

The thing that is so special about Tap Day is that those
honored have shown above average ability in both activi-
ties and scholarship——a feat not so easily attained and not
very easily maintained once it has been accomplished.
While many would hardly approach the term “scholar,”
tappees certainly possess the qualities of well-rounded per-
sonalities. ’ ‘ ' .

There are those, however, whose desire to participate
in activities surpasses their urge to join in on- classroom

 

Less Ten Percent . ,; Q,

I   Discounted

By lrv Rothman 

For the ﬁrst time in years, Student Congress
has put into effect a thoroughly valuable program
for the students that it represents. A week ago
Monday, Al Boll who served as chairman of the
special committee,‘ announced that Pittsburgh mer-
chants had agreed to allow discounts for student

shoppers.

The amount—ten percent less
on goods purchased at any one
of twenty stores in downtown,
Squirrel Hill, Millvale, East
Liberty, or the Oakland areas.
Pies For Carnival

Spring Festival creators who
have need of pies to satisfy the
sadistic whims of customers have
only to dash down Forbes Street
to a nearby bakery to get them,
less ten percent.

buy his own ‘equipment.

But for the glutton, who wants to eat rather
than to throw food, or for the camera ﬁend whose
delight is adjusting tripods instead of shoulder
pads, a nearby drugstore or camera shop will pro-
vide opportunity to use the discount ‘cards, less

ten percent guaranteed.

By this time, interested Pittites who are aware
of this plan should have their handy Discount
service cards in hand, hunting up the places where
these advantages may be had. If you don’t. have
one, buddy, you’re missing out on a real bar-

gain!

Plan Sponsored Jointly

One of the big advantages of the plan is that it
is being sponsored jointly by Duquesne, Carnegie
Tech, Mt. Mercy, and PCW along with our Alma
Mater. Merchants offered to join in main for the
potential college student body available to pur-

Herbertis “Conquest”

By Paul Harrison

I left Korea in August of 1951
promising mself I would try to
forget everything I saw, the bit-
ter .feelings war gave me and,
above all, the buddies who died
in Korea. '

I was successful to a point and

a book. A vet-

Through his book he made me
remember Korea.

He h-ad a ﬁrm handshake and
a pleasant smile. After exchang-

him if I could borrow a copy of
his recently published book.’ He
agreed to lend it to me.

Takes Effort To Expand

The idea is good, but it takes effort to continue
and to expand. With the support of all city col-
leges, the future of the plan looks optimistic. That
is, if individual governing presidents decide not
to hedge as they’ve done before on a dead issue

such as is called “Damage Rally Pact.” .

But it is unlikely that the Student Discount
Service would continue next year if the students
who had rushed so eagerly to the student desk
for tickets the ﬁrst week don’t take advantage of;..,»—.~

here and at other district colleges might well deal

he had received quite a few
decorations due to his combat
efforts in Korea. I felt I owed it
to him, as a fellow veteran, to
read his book and see what he
had to say.

I took the book home to read
it. I pondered for a short time
over it’s title, “Coiiquest to No-
where”. In my mind, a better
title for the “forgotten war”
could not have been chosen.

The ﬁrst few pages made me
wince. I hadn’t the opportunity,
if you could call it that, to see
how the Chinese tortured their
prisoners. I feel now that I was
lucky I didn’t. The story began
to unwind and,‘ quoting the
jacket on the book, “it is brutal”
and without a doubt factual.

Letters to
Players Gratifiecl

Editor, the Pitt News:

We should like to take this op-
portunity, on behalf of the mem-
bers of Pitt Players, to express
our thanks for the wonderful

- manner in which our production

of “Dark of the Moon” was re-
ceived. We feel that this year
has been an outstanding one in
the history of Players.

For out of the four productions
we consider that we have had
four successful productions. The
audiences that witnessed “Dark
of the Moon” certainly presented
us withiall the reward a theatre
group could ask for.
tainly we of Players are grateful
for having been given the chance
to present the type of theatre that
few college groups have pre-
sented in the past. ‘

However no thanks or appre-

And cer-‘

the Editor

ciation ‘can approach complete-
ness without singling out the man
who is responsible for the suc-
cess of Pitt Players. We refer to
Harvey J. Pope, the director.

For in the‘ time he has been at ‘
the University he has built Play- ,

ers from an exclusive, cliquish
organization into an activity
which is open to any undergrad-
uate who has only one qualiﬁca-
tion—the desire to work.

And we of Players feel that
those of you who saw “Dark of
the Moon” have certainly’ paid
Mr. Pope a ﬁtting compliment,
not only for his ﬁnal production
as director, but for doing a su-
perlative job in all his eight years
at Pitt. - »

I Again, for all the members of
Pitt Players, thank you all.

GI Humor Present

The typical GI humor is there
too. A bit over-done, maybe, but
typical. When men joke about
death when it’s no further than

away they can be from but one

This book is proof the War in
Korea shouldn’t be forgotten.

possible. But was victory possi-

book but facing those over-
whelming hordes of Chinese, I’ll
bet he thought many times “is

An interesting sidelight on the
book was a human interest story
in itself. The GI who portrayed
the role of “Bugs” in the book
is in real’ life‘Clarence Saddler
to whom Herbert dedicated the
book proclaiming Saddler as “a
real hero”.

Thought Buddy Dead

Herbert thought Saddler had
been killed after he sacrificed
himself to become a’ prisoner of

I the Chinese to enable Herbert to

escape. It turned outpthat Sad-
dler returned to the States last
Christmas after being held pris-
oner for 27 months. In all that

time he was kept in. a room

alone. I agree with Herbert that
man must be a real hero,

“Conquest may not be THE

war but for a ﬁrst hand account

believe this book won’t be
matched.

(Author of "Barefoot Boy with Cheek,” etc.)

THE GIFT HORSE

Many of our friends will soon be graduating. What kind of
gifts should we give them? ' ‘

Here is no simple question.-It is never simple to ﬁnd gifts for
people who have everything, and college students, as everyone
knows, are the most richly endowed of mortals. They’ve got
beauty and truth. They’ve got rhythm. They’ve got stout hearts,
willing hands, and a clear vision that dispels the miasmas of the
future as the morning sun sears away the last wisps of a cool
night's fog. They’ve got heaps and heaps of money, as who would
not who has been receiving such a huge allowance over four
years of schooling? ‘

What can we give them that they don’t already have?

One infallible gift for the person who has everything is, of

course, a stethoscope. New models, featuring sequined earpieces

and power steering, are now on display at your local surgical

supply house. Accompanying each stethoscope is a gift card with

this lovely poem: »
When you hear your heart beat,
When you hear it pound,
Remember me, your buddy,
William H enry Round.

If, by some odd chance, your name does not happen to be
William Henry Round (you’re laughing, but it’s possible), here
is another dandy suggestion for the person who has everything
— a gift certiﬁcate from the American Bar Association.

These certiﬁcates, good at your local 1awyer’s, come in three
convenient sizes: small, medium, and large. The small certiﬁcate
covers title searches and writs of estoppel. The medium size
covers torts, claim jumping, and violations of the Smoot-Hawley
Act. The large one covers kidnapping, murder, and barratry.

If, by some odd chance, you don’t know what barratry is
(you’re laughing, but it’s possible), it is arson at sea. This inter-
esting crime is called after Cosmo “Bubbles” Barrat, a captain
in the British navy during theplast century, who was addicted to

burning his ships. One man 0’ war after another fell victim to

his incendiary bent. The Admiralty kept getting crosser and

‘ crosser, but every time they called in Captain Barrat for a

scolding-, he would roll his big blue eyes and tug his forelock and

I promise faithfully never to do it again. Oh, butter wouldn’t

melt in his mouth, that one! '

So they would give him another ship, and he would soon reduce
it to a scattering of charred spars. He burned more than 120,000
discharged as “doubtful oﬂicer

material.”

After his separation from the navy, he moved to Vienna where .

he changed his name to Freud and invented Scrabble.

But I digress. I was listing gifts for the person who has every-
thing, and here is another one. This gift, in fact, is not only for
persons who have everything, it is also for persons who have
nothing, for persons who have next to nothing, for‘ persons who
have next to everything, and for persons in between. I refer,
of course, to Philip Morris cigarettes. Here is the cigarette
for ’everybody—f_or everybody, that is, who likes a mild relaxing
smoke of‘ ﬁne vintage tobacco in a handsome brown package
that snaps open with the greatest. of ease._ Forithose, if such
there be, who like dull, nondescript tobacco _in a package that
requires _a burg1ar’s kit to open, Philip Morris is definitely the
wrong gift. ’

_ Among the newer gifts that warrant your attention is a revolu-

tionary development in the enjoyment of recorded music.‘This
is the Low-Fi Phonograph. The Low-Fi, product of years ,of
patient research, has so little ﬁdelity to the record you put on
it that if, for example, you put Stardust on the turntable,
Me_la-ncholy Baby will come out. This is an especially welcome
gift for, people who hate Stardust.

Finally there is Sigafoos Shaving Cream, a brand new kind
of cream that makes whiskers grow in instead of out. You just

bite them off in the morning.
©M-ax Shulman, 1955

To Max’s suggestion to give PHILIP MORRIS for graduation, the
makers of PHILIP MORRIS, who bring you this column, add a

school, received the Athletic Com-
mittee Award, which is conferred
upon the student maintaining the
highest standards of scholarship,
athletic a b i 1 i t y, sportsmanship,
and aptitude.

In presenting the Hartwig tro-
phy to Kaupe, Dr. Frank Fer-
raro said, “The Hartwig Award
always goes to a. try guy.” He
cited Kaupe for his perform-
ances on the 300-yard medley re-
lay and 400-yard freestyle relay
teams-—both~ of which copped
the Eastern Collegiate Swim-

ming championships in these
events.
Ferraro also added, “Anytime

there was a job to be dpne it was
automatic to call on this man.”
Kaupe was referred to as being a
jack-of—a1l-trades for Ben Grady’s

wasn’t swimming in the relays,
the Education senior was filling in
at the breast-stroke, f r e e s t y le
sprints, or individual medley.

The Athletic Committee Award,
presented by Dr. Vincent Lanfear,
carries with it recognition of the
best combination of high scholastic
award and athletic ability. Lan-
fear commended Emery for being
an, “Outstanding athlete, scholar,
and gentleman.”

Emery, who is in his fourth

year with the mitters-—-topping all 5
batters in his first and third sea-'
sons——expressed his thanks “to anf
old friend of ours, Coach Ralph?
Mitterling.” The veteran mentor”!
who guided Emery in his firs ti
three years is presently hospital-
ized and recovering from a heart
attack.

Special awards given at the
affair Monday night went to
trackster Arnie Sowell and
wrestler Ed Peery for gaining
- national recognition.

Sowell got his national recogni-
tion in a grandslam fashion; ‘first
by copping the IC4A 880-yard run,
second by taking the NCAA 880,
next in tying the world’s record
in the 1000-yard run, and latest
by taking the Pan—American 880
at Mexico City. Coach Carl Olson
called Sowell, “One of the great-
est runners I’ve ever coached.”

Presenting the special ‘award to
Peery was none other than his dad
-Coach Rex Peery. Ed’s national
recognition came when he copped
the Eastern Collegiate Wrestling_
Championship and the NCAA title
in the 123-pound class. Although
Coach Peery didn’t want to boast
too loudly about his son’s achieve-
ments he did say, when handing
Ed his award, “Fellow, you’re a
champion.”

For Three-Game Road Series

By AL PELAEZ

With a completed home game ﬁnally under their belts,
Coach Bobby Lewis’ onrushing Panther mittmen now take
to the road for a three game eastern trip opening tomorrow

in Ithaca.

Cornell will offer the opposition followed by Syracuse‘

Friday and Juniata Saturday.

Optimistic over their smashing 13-3 conquest of the not

Linkers Face Duquesne Today

Looking For Fifth Straight Win

By DON KAISERMAN

‘ Riding the crest of a four

-game win streak as a result

lof winning two games over the weekend while playing only

one, the Panther golf team will attempt to continue their
three-year domination of Duquesne this afternoon.

Coach Dave McCormick’s

linkers hold a string of ﬁve

straight vitcories over their inter-¢
city rivals dating back to 1951.

Friday’s 81/2-1/2 win’ over West-
minster gave the locals a 3-2 rec-
dor for the season. Paced_by team
captain Bill Stockdale who was
medalist with a 74, the Panthers
did not lose a single match.

Stockdale, Ken Fisher, and Dick _
Ryabik continued their winning
ways and were joined by Jim Zoc-
cola and Dick Siegal, who replac-
ed John Defibaugh, in the start-
ing six. Gene Farrell tied his op-
ponent, giving the Dukes their
only score.

The second meet won over the
weekend was the Juniata match
which took place April 21, but
was disputed as a result of an
argument over a lost ball. With
the score deadlocked 4-4, Zoccola
was leading his man, Juniata’.s
Larry Shepard, 1-up on the 18th
hole. ’

ord now stands at five victories’ as
against six defeats.

Veteran Don Miller, a crafty
right-hander, will handle the
mound chores tomorrow against
the Big Red at Cornell. Miller will
be shooting for his second victory
of the season.

which would result in a penalty
stroke, or whether it was buried
in the soggy turf.

Relays Need
Better Handling  

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

To make excuses for the Pitt showing in the Penn Relays is not

-»necessary. No alibis are needed when-misfortune plagues a team

like it did.

The injury to Bill Green Friday afternoon and the accident with
Ed Saunders the following day were not the fault of either boy
nor the opposing men who were involved:

From the press box where this reporter observed, it seems that
maybe the planning committee of the Relays could have manipulated
the action to better advantage.

With more than 300 entries from 500 colleges in the 61st
annual carnival, starters in almost every event were numerous
and‘ the main objective for each trackst-er was to avoid being
trampled at the start.

One event had no less than 15 starters! Any time that many
men start with the blast of the gun and go for the inside lane, some-
one is bound to get pushed, bumped, or injured.

The latter was the case with Green. His accident occurred in

the ﬁrst 10 yards of the distance medley relay of which he was the ~

leadoff man. No sooner had he taken his opening steps than he
received a spike injury in his Achilles heel from a runner behind
him. This placed him in the hospital and out for the season.

The misfortune with Saunders was very similar, the only dif-
ference being that Ed ggt a chance to run about 100 yards before he
collided with a Syracuse thinclad, consequently dropping his baton.
and falling 40 yards b_ehind in the race.

Coach Carl Olson and the entire Panther delegation Were
disgusted with the whole situation, not so much because these
incidents proved Pitt’s downfall, but because it was felt that
more heats and trial runs could have been held in each event.
therefore eliminating the need to start so many men in each
relay. 

Saunders’ collison prevented the Panthers from entering the
mile relay, the last event, because as Olson said, “there’s bigger
things than this and we’re not going to tempt fortune aI1ym0I‘€
here.”

In fact, the veteran track mentor stated he wasn’t sure whether
Pitt would return to the Penn Relays. “There’s too many injuries
the way it’s being run now,” was his terse comment.

And the coach wasn’t wrong. More than a dozen athletes were
taken to the hospital fromginjuries in this, a non-contact sport.

The shame of it all, though, Was that the many track enthusi-
asts who turned out to see the best half-miler in the world, Arnie
Sowell, got just a short glimpse of the fabulous one as he ran an
amazing 1.49.1 in the last leg of the sprint medley.

But, then as Olson says, there’s more to this track game and
the Panthers and Sowell will get a chance to really show their stuﬁ
in a few weeks in the IC4A’s and the Nationals.

the second turn in the sprint med-

Thinclalds Await Ar1iny,rSU
After Penn Relay Misfortunes

By STEVE BUTCHOCK ,

Ohio State and Army invade the Pitt Stadium this Sat-
urday for a triangular meet with the Panthers as Coach Carl
Olson’s cindermen make their home debut following their
hard—1uck showing in the Penn Relays last weekend.

Local track enthusiasts should be treated to one of the

    

Blue and Gold’s most earnest ef-3
forts as they attempt to ‘make
amends for their disappointing
performance at Franklin Field.
But topping the powerful Buck-
eyes and Cadets has taken on the
aspects of a man-sized task for
the locals who will be without the
services of sprinter Bill Green.
Green was severely spiked at
the start of the distance medley
relay in a jam—up on the first
turn in Philly and may be lost for
the entire season. If so, the Jungle
Cats will have to assert them-
selves that much more when they

meet Penn State and Notre Dame
later this month.

Foremost in their minds at the
present time, though, are the West
Pointers and the Staters who both

their own against just about any-
body. Needless to say, this has
caused much concern for the vet-
eran Panther mentor as he hur-
riedly searches for someone to re-
place Green on the mile relay
team in which the Ohioans are
expected to be very strong.

Much to the local’s chagrin—
the ‘Green spiking wasn’t enough
—Ed Saunders‘ lost his baton on

ley relay and the Panthers were
far out of contention even though
Arnie Sowell ran an anchor half-
mile in 1:49.1. ‘ '
After this occurrence, Olson
scratched the mile relay team.
The locals finished fourth in the
four-mile relay and did not place
in any of the other relay events.

One bright spot for Skyscraper
U., however, was Paul Thrash
winning the AA U400 meter hur-
dles in 52.7 Alan Gunderson fin-
ished third in the four-mile run
and Bill Smith tied for third in
the pole vault in other individual
events.

Tom Shepard

All-American Team

Tom Shepard, captain of the‘
Panther riﬂe team, was named to
the National Rifle Association’s
All—American team Monday. This
squad consists of the top ten
shooters in the country.

Shepard began ﬁring for the
Blue and Gold during his sopho-
more year and proceeded to lead
the riﬂemen in their climb to the
Greater Pittsburgh Riﬂe League
title this year——his third varsity
campaign. Having a three season
average of 283 with a personal
record high of 295, Shepard has
been one of the best shooters in
this area throughout his college
career}

His top score in the annual
regionals at Buffalo was 293 which
he ﬁred as a junior. This year’s
regional found Shepard ﬁring a
288 placing him third among the
riﬂemen competing at Buffalo.
Shepard helped bring success to
Panther shooters in league play
this year after leading the team
all season long -by ﬁring a 282 in
a shoot-off with the Dukes for
the title. - '

The Blue and Gold is entering a ‘
team i‘. the NRA’s outdoor meet
to b.: held at Rosedale Shooting
Range from May 15-22. The team
has improved consistently during
the season and should do well in

   

this meet.

Plan Summer Worlc

More than 20 petroleum engi—¢

neering students at the University
of Pittsburgh are planning for a
summer in one of the nation’s ma-
jor areas producing oil or natural
gas.

It’s no vacationthe students are
planning, but three months -of
work with one ofthe nation’s ma-
jor oil producers or perhaps with
a natural gas company. When
each student returns to school in
the fall, he must write a report
on his summer activities.

Students Paid

Most companies make a practice
of taking on petroleum engineer-
ing students for a summer or two
of work. It is valuable experience

1aborer’s wages.

Not only does the summer
work give the student ex-
perience, but it enables the
companies to look over the men
they may want to hire when
they have received their engi-
neering degrees.

the petroleum engineering depart-
ment at Pitt, is in a position to

come back from a summer in the
field, they're full of interest and

VVork Not Absolute

The summer work is not an ab-
solute requirement for graduation
in petroleum engineering at Pitt,
he added, but students are urged
to go out at the end of their soph-
omore or junior year. Some go
two summers, and all go at least
one if at all possible.

Most companies take three or
four students from each of sev-
eral schools, making their choice
of undergraduate summer work-
ers when they visit campuses
early in the year to interview
seniors for job offers.
