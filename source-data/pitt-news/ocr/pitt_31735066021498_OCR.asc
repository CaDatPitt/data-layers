Budget cuts
restructure
police staff

By David T. Welch

- Asst. News Editor

Limited state funding for Pitt
has taken a $204,000 bite outof
the Department of Public Safety’s
budget this year.

After the reduction the Public
Safety budget amounts to
$2,999,000, according to Vice
President of Administration John
Yeager.

Public Safety Director William
Brennan said that the budget cut
has not hindered the ability of his
department to serve the campus.

“We haven’t really lost anything,
and we are not understaffed,”
Brennan said.

Brennan will be placing
advertisements in the local media
for new police officers, and he
said he will be hiring two more
policemen next month.

Yeager added there was no re-
duction in the Public Safety staff
caused by the budget cut. “There
were no layoffs, and we don't
plan on doing that,” he said.

Public Safety has had to
restructure the scheduling and
placement of officers on different
areas of campus to cover all points
where police are 4 stationed,
according to Yeager.

“This [budget cut] was a planned
one. We looked at the scheduling,
and [Brennan] was able to re-

Pitt aids Baltic states with foreign policy

By Katie Kaminski
For -T be Pitt News

. When the newly independent
Baltic republics begin to develop
their own foreign policies, Pitt
will be there to help.

Pitt’s International Management
and Development Institute began
a foreign-affairs training program
in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
this week to help the republics
develop their own foreign
policies.

V IMDI director Riall W. Nolan
and University of Pittsburgh
professors Phil Williams and
Dorothy Bassett are members of
the six—person training team.

IMDI, which is part of the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, developed
the training series in response to
requests from the Baltic leadership
for assistance.

The program, designed for
ofﬁcials of the foreign ministries
of the three Baltic republics, began
on Oct. 7 in Tallin, Estonia. It will
then move to Riga, Latvia and
Vilinus, Lithuania.

The delegation will help these
countries to establish and follow
their own foreign policies and
become acclimated to
international politics, according
to Nolan. .

“The Baltic States are just
emerging from 50 years of
occupation and isolation. It’s
therefore not surprising that
people there see a need for
focused, practical training which
helps them in their efforts to
reclaim their place in the world
community,” Nolan said.

In order for the program to be
successful, Serewicz stressed the
importance of the Baltic
governments and the training
delegation to work together.
“Active participation is necessary
for successful training.

So far we’ve seen an incredible
response from them," Serewicz
added.

Fax machines, photocopiers
and reliable communications
systems are scarce, according to
Serewicz.

“Setting up the program is one
of the challenges. It is difficult to

organize large seminars because
the Baltic states do not have
much of the modern technology
we are accustomed to,” Serewicz
said.

Another challenge IMDI faces
is the lack of experience among
those currently in power in the
Baltics.

The younger, less experienced
parliament members replacing the
Communists in power are
unfamiliar with the various
ways governments. can be
organized and run, according to
Serewicz. . 1

In August 1990, the foreign
ministries of the three republics
expressed a need for training in
international affairs for their

government officials.‘ Nolan .

headed a four—person team that
met with officials of all three
Baltic capitals to plan the content
of the program. A needs analysis
was also done during this three-
week visit.

The $120,000 project is being
funded by The Pew Charitable
Trusts, a national philanthropic

agency.

time he had attended Dartmouth
and Yale, Lord had encountered
two music teachers who shaped
his outlook on music in two very

different ways.

The first music teacher was a
German professor named Leo
Schrade, a man who Lord said
made a scholar out of him and
gave him his standards in music.

“Leo Schrade was one of seven
or eight immigrants from Eu rope
who came to the [United States]
before World V(_/ar II to establish

the discipline of musicology in
this country,” Lord said, citing
Schrade’s academic importance
to music. Lord described his
relationship with Schrade at that
time as being a very strict and
demanding student-teacher
relationship.

Jean Langlais, a blind pianist
from France, was also an
important inspiration to Lord. Lord
described Langlais as a man who
had the ability to get students to
do things they might not have
had the confidence to do. Lord

described his relationship with
Langlais as more personal than
with _Schrade.

Lord first came to the University
of Pittsburgh in 1962, ,when
Edward Litchfield was chancellor.
Lord said that Litchfield deserves
far more credit than he is given
for turning Pitt around.

It was Litchfield who brought
Mellon Foundation money into
Pitt for setting up a humanities
program which included a
graduate program in music-
ology

Being the only Ph.D. in the de-
partment atthat time, Lord said
this was done at a time when
very little teaching or performing
of music was done at Pitt.

Lord said he dislikes the idea

many people have that a music
professor does not do research as
other professors do in their own
subjects.

“Every recital I do is a demon-
stration of my research,” he said.

Lord is dedicatedto classical
music, and the scope of the
classical music field is so
enormous that he can only focus
on that type of music. His favorite
composer is Bach. Lord enjoys
teaching at Pitt because his job is
a combination of teaching‘ and
playing music.

He especially enjoys
introducing music and its cultural
background to undergraduate
students who are taking
introductory music courses as a
humanities requirement.

Holding the vote
.  When Judge Clarence Thomas requested a delay on the
5 vote of the Supreme Court regardinghis confirmation, he
I _ expected only a 48-hour investigation of sexual-harassment
it allegations against him.
..  Instead, Bush’s nominee to replace Justice Thurgood
Marshall was given a week. .
' Thomas was accused last weekend of harassing a
“former employee at the Equal Employment Opportunity
-? ‘ - Commission more than 10 years ago. His motive in asking
_ _ for a delay was to clear his name.
. Anita Hill, now a law professor at the University of
 ’ »-Oklahoma, alleged that Thomas spoke graphically about
 sexual relations and pornography to her while she was his
~ ’ assistant at the Education Department’s civil-rights office.
"According to Hill, theharassment continued when they
. "worked, together at the EEOC. g
 Hill’s motives for bringing up the allegations at this late
'date are being questioned. However Hill reported the
 incidents to the Senate judiciary Committee weeks ago.
. The fact that the Judiciary Committee did not investigate

  the allegations themselves proves that Hill was not taken’

A_' seriously. ,
I In an affidavit presented to the Court yesterday, Thomas
. expressed his concern for an in-depth probe ,of the
 allegations against him. Thomas has denied Hill’s
 statements but admitted to the FBI that he had asked Hill
V‘ out a few times and had given up pursuing when she
 “declined. ,
’ Hill’s accusations, if they are proven true, will damage
Thomas and his reputation for the rest of his life.
. Apparently some officials are not swayed by the
~ allegations. When George Bush was asked last evening
whether or not he still supported Thomas, he angrily
7 replied to reporters, “Damn right!”
- The votewas postponed after several crucial Democratic
supporters said they could not vote on Thomas until the
- ‘allegations were aired. I .
Senator Harris Wofford was one of the aforementioned
_ Democrats. He said that he would vote against Thomas if
 the vote was conducted without an investigation.-
‘ Despite the uncertainty of Thomas’ future in the Court,
Senate Republican Leader. Robert Dole predicted that

Thomas would ultimately be confirmed by a comfortable

margin. ,

_— Sexual harassment is not something to be ignored in any
"office, but the fact that Thomas is about to ‘be appointed
H to the highest court in the land only makes the issue more

'. sensitive.
I The National Organization for Women is taking Thomas’
1 alleged actions as an indication of his views regarding

women’s rights. ,

If Thomas becomes a Supreme Court justice, he will (in
the future) be voting on controversies that will have
repercussions for all Americans.

Someone who sexually harasses should not be excused
without question. The Court should be praised for its

' decision to put the vote on hold. ‘ _ I

For anyone in an elevated political position, this type of

behavior can not be tolerated.

Everybody needs a vice to s7/trvive

Most college students say
they’re bored, need to release
nervous tension and want .to
purge themselves of stress. These
students want an activity that
they can perform at any hour of
the day or night, one that will
make them feel better about
themselves, one that will amuse
endlessly and effortlessly. These
students need a vice! But how
does one find the perfect vice?

One obvious choice is smoking.
This activity is relatively simple
to learn and requires little energy.
Unfortunately cigarettes aren't
cheap, and smoking leads to
yellow teeth and nasty-smelling
breath, ‘along with other health
disabilities. Also, climbing the
numerous ﬂights of stairs in Pitt
buildings is hard even for non-
smokers. '- I

Some students chew gum,

- especially the’ popular Carefree.

brand. However the statement
on the side of the pack can be
frightening‘: “USE OF THIS
‘ MAY BE

I-IAZARDOUS TO YOUR

I HEALTH. THIS PRODUCT

CONTAINS SACCHARIN, WHICH
HAS BEEN‘ DETERMINED TO
CAUSE CANCER IN
LABORATORY ANIMALS."
Despite the inherent foolishness
of this statement (who really
believes that rats chew gum?), it
can be a turnoff for the student
who is searching for the perfect
vice.

Bianca A
Stoner

Another vice which outwardly
appears pleasing is‘ excessive
eating. This activity is fun,
convenient and relatively
rewarding. Who doesn’t feel good
after devouring. some Domino’s
pizza? But the cost of food can
get expensive, and that weight-
gain thing is deﬁnitely not cool.

Excessive drinking is another
feasible vice, but the deterrent
lies in one word — bangover—
which requires no need for further
explanation.

A Another vice which- some

, students use to release nervous

tension is reading, a_n activity
which is productive but can
unfortunately lead to eyestrain
and pathetic nicknames, such as
“bookworm.” .

Watching television is almost
the perfect vice: easy and
effortless, this activity requires
zero, ‘ energy and little

‘concentration. Nevertheless,

excessive TV watching can lead

because it starts at 3 p.m. Then I’d

. have to miss Santa Barbara.”)

/

to serious couch potatoitis and '

also can be addictive, a malady
which manifests in the viewer's
refusal to perform basic life
activities because of a fear of
missing certain shows. (“N 0, even
though I need that credit to
graduate, I can't take that class

Playing video games is kind of
cool because of the neat noises
and bright lights, but moving the
joystick does require an awful lot
of energy, and who wants all that
work?

Another feasible vice is
gossiping, but this activity often
leads to tension between friends,
which leads to stress and nervous
tension, which means that this

' activity does not really qualify as

a vice. _
The final and probably most

popular tension-breaking action ’
is sex. This activity is unique in _

the fact that it is both the cause of
and the cure for nervous energy.
The drawbacks are long—term
factors, such as pregnancy and
disease, while the benefits are
short-term factors, such as
physical thrills and that morning-
after excitement caused by the
realization that you can’t even
remember your partner's last
name. 1

As most students have learned,
there actually is no perfect vice.
All of these tension-relieving
activities do have drawbacks and
limitations, so l_ike all other things’
in life, people must weigh the
pros and cons and make their

. own decisions.

student majoring in political
science.

Misinformation damages story

I would expect the editors of a newspaper to take '
their jobs seriously even if it is for a college
newspaper. Where were Jennifer Calabrese and
Scot Ross when Mike Sula submitted his article on

the Cannes Festival of Humor
(10-5-91)?

Mr. Sula’s article was written as _
if he has no knowledge of
advertising, television, human nature or reviewing
movies. He spends as much time insulting people
as actually reviewing the movie. In fact he spends
more time telling us what we will see rather than
giving us his poor opinion on what he has seen.

Letters

animals.

Mike Sula’s writing also gives the impression of
a person with confused thought. He complains of
how American advertisers use sex (with his example

.5?!‘ I.isS‘fit~ “‘

being a commercial not even in the movie), then
praises foreign advertiser's use of sex.

Some of the devices used by foreign advertisers:
‘A freewheelin’ French maiden  gets a jet of high-

poweredurine in the face;” an
attractive, English speaking
woman jumps onto an

overweight French man simply '
because he can speak English and a German
housewife who fantasizes about leather and whips.
Mike’s future of sex in advertising is sex with

This is a very confused person.

Mirer, Bettis lead ND offense against Panthers Saturday

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

In each of its four wins, Notre
Dame has averaged over 46 points
a game.

“Pure juggernaut” is how Pitt
head coach Paul Hackett
describes the Irish offense.

And the statistics seem to agree
with him. Notre Dame’s top three

Ricarao MCDOﬂ6ll6i loo/es

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

The last time Pitt beat Notre
Dame was during the 1987 season.

Pitt went on to play in .the
Bluebonnet Bowl that year and
finished with an 8-4 record. The
Irish finished with an identical 8-
4 record andplayed in the Cotton

‘ Bowl. Not only did both teams

lose their bowl games that season,
but they both were beaten by
Southwest Conference powers.
The Panthers fell to Texas, and
the Irish were beaten handily by
Texas A&M. ' '

Pitt senior co—captain Ricardo
McDonald probably remembers
that season vividly. After all, he

, was earning All~State honors at

Eastside High School in Paterson,
N.J., and being recruited. by
several major college programs
—— none of which was Notre
Dame.

However one player who was
being recruited by the Irish at the
time and eventually landed in
South Bend was Ricardo’s twin
brother Devon.

“It never really bothered me,”
Ricardo said, referring to the fact
that the Irish had recruited Devon
and not him. “It was just one of
those things.” " _

Devon also was named All-
State as a high—school senior, but

rushers all average over five yards
a carry. This becomes slightly
more impressive when you see
that fullback Jerome Bettis has
picked up his 6.5-yard average
mostly by running straight up the
middle.

Rushing is once again the
strength of the Irish. Bettis is the
leader, with five touchdowns and
439 yards. At 247 pounds, he is

not particularly nimble, but he’s
very effective. In 68 carries Bettis
has lost exactly two yards.

“The inside running of Bettis
was unbelievable last Saturday

S night,” Hackett said, referring to

Notre Dame’s win at Stanford. In
that game Bettis scored four
touchdowns (three on the
ground) on his way to a 179-yard
performance.

Bucs, Braves in big ball battle

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

Pitching and defense feed off
each other, and they win ball
games. Both teams in the National
League Playoffs have solid
pitching staffs greatly aided by

"strong defenses.

The NL East champion Pirates
have a strong pitching staff,
second in the league with a 3.40
team earned run average. They
don’t strike many people out; but
they have one of the best defenses
in baseball. Free-a gent losses after
the 1990 season hurt this team,
but they kept the most important
one, pitcher Zane Smith.

The champs in the West, the
had very
ineffective pitching the last few
years. Much of that was blamed
on the effects of a poor defense
on a ‘young pitching staff. The
presence of such ground-ball
butchers as shortstop Andres
Thomas supported that theory,
not to mention having the always
adventurous Lonnie Smith in the

outfield.

Three free agents, firstbaseman
Sid Bream, shortstop Rafael
Belliard and third baseman Terry
Pendleton,solidified the infield,
and Otis Nixon helped in the
outfield. They still have
weaknesses defensively. Belliard
shares shortstop withJeff Blauser,
who is better suited to third base.
Center ﬁelder Ron Gant is still
learning the position and it shows
sometimes. Smith is playing a lot
now that Nixon has been
suspended for drug use. Still,
there has been great
improvement.

That improvement has led to
the development of the Braves’
staff into one of the best in the
National League (third in team
ERA). Youngsters Tom Glavine
and Steve Avery, who both
struggled last year, have had
outstanding seasons.

How these teams got here is
the biggest difference. The Pirates
won their division last season.
They led most of the way this
year and ran away with it later,
clinching it Sept. 22 and winning
by a final margin of 14 games.

They also had the best record in
baseball this year, 98-64.

The Braves finished last in the
NL West last year. This season
they fought a tough race to the
end with the Dodgers, and they
didn’t clinch until the second-to-
lastday of the season. The playoff
experience from last year may be
a big help to the Pirates.

Atlanta does have some of that
experience on its side. Bream
and Belliard were with the Pirates
last season. The Braves showed
their gratitude for these “gifts” by
dominating the season series nine
games to three.

Neither team ever feels it is out
of a game. League MVP candidates
Gant (32 HR, 105 RBI), who had
his second straight 30 homer/30
stolen—base season, and batting
champ Terry Pendleton (.519, 22,
85) have been key contributors
all year in Atlanta. Dave Justice
(.278, 21, 87) missed a large part
of the season with injuries. Bream
has also been hurt and has
struggled since his return.

Offense

Continued from page 7
Culver, one of last year’s main tailbacks, has
played sparingly because of injuries.
This is a team that runs often and well. The Irish
sport a hefty average of over 293 rushing yards a

_ game, coming on power runs and options.

_ Pitt has had trouble, historically, defending the
option. But Notre Dame’s option is not dependent
on blazing speed at the corners. Junior quarterback
Rick Mirer is the catalyst for the entire scheme.
While Mirer has never been characterized as
speedy, he has been efficient for the Irish. “I think
he’s a very underrated quarterback,” Holtz said.
“He’s played exceptionally well.”

Mirer has balanced the offensive attack well.
He has six rushing touchdowns and 10 through
the air. Hackett also touched on the efficiency of
Mirer, who has completed nearly 64 percent of
his passes.

But running dominates the Irish offense. “We’d
like to throw more to use Mirer’s talents,” Holtz
said. “But we won’t try it this week because of the
pass—rushing of [Keith] Hamilton and [Sean] Gilbert.
Also, Pitt mixes up their coverages a lot. We need
to be more balanced, but we don’t want to rely
too much on the pass.”

When Mirer does throw, he looks to split end
Tony Smith, who averages 21 yards a reception.
Flanker Lake Dawson is tied with Smith for the

lead in receiving with 14 catches. Tight end
Derek Brown is, Hackett said, “the finest tight
end in the nation.” Brown has three touchdown
receptions and is a big target at 6—feet, 7-inches.

Of course there is no “Rocket” Ismail on the
ﬁeld for Notre Dame. “We’re not a big-play
team,” Holtz said.

Still, the passing game is expanded more than
it was last year. “Last year they had to protect
Mirer more,” Hackett said. “They were more
conservative. But now they have lots of
formations and motion and every screen in the
book?

Paving the way for all this is an offensive line
featuring seniors Mirko Jurkovic and Gene
McGuire. Jurkovic is one of four seniors on the
line and has emerged as the leader of the unit.
McGuire is in his first year as starting center. The
line is typically big, averaging_284 pounds a
man.

“The Notre Dame offense is fun to watch,”
Hackett said, “because they are able to do so
many things: run inside, the option, play-a.ction
passing.” ‘

So how will Pitt force the Irish to be the
spectators? “There’s nothing magical about it,”
Hackett said. “You’ve’ just got to play hard,
chase the ball and do the things we’ve been
doing.” ‘

candidate, has come back from a
slow start to have another great
season. Bobby Bonilla’s hit only
18 home runs but hit a career
high .302 average and had 100
RBIs. Center fielder Andy Van
Slyke (.265, 17, 83) is the best
center fielder in the game. Late-
season pickup Steve Buechele
(.261, 22, 85 combined between
Texas and Pittsburgh) has

lineupbehind Bonilla and Bonds.

The supporting cast for the
stars is an advantage for the
Pirates. Shortstop Jay Bell and
the catching platoon of Mike
Lavalliere and Don Slaught have
been solid offensively and
defensively. Second basemanJose
Lind has ,been his usual

The matchup is even, but the

time to select a college, Devon
opted for Notre Dame, while
brother Ricardo was set On Pitt.
Once again, both had decided to
attend different schools.

“I didn’t want to be in the
shadow of Devon McDOnald,”
Ricardo said. “I’m sure he didn’t
want to be in the same position.”

Said Devon: “I love my brother,
[but] I didn’t really want to go to
school with lhiml.”

As a first—year Panther during
the 1988 season, Ricardo became
only the fifth Panther in the past
two decades to start the first
game of the season. His name
was added to a list that includes

large, thriving programs. The
addition of scholarships will give
Pitt the ability to recruit some of
the more talented women athletes
that they were unable to get
because of a lack in ﬁnancial
assistance.

“I think that this new program
is great," said women's basketball
head coach Kirk Bruce. “I think
that it will definitely make
recruiting a little bit easier. I think
the impact it will have depends
On how it is distributed; however
every little bit helps."

Ball_Park Franks, the best—selling
hot dog in‘ Pennsylvania, will
finance this scholarship by
donating one penny from every
pound Of F-ranks sold in the state
Over the next year to the fund.

former Panther standouts Bill
Fralic, Tony Dorsett, Hugh Green
and Marc Spindler.

During RicardO’s rookie season
at Pitt, he started in all 11 games
and finished the season with 53
total tackles, including 23 solo
stops. That season the Irish beat
the Panthers 50-20. Pitt finished
the year with a mediocre 6-5
record, while Devon and the
Irish went undefeated (12-0) and
won the national championship.

Now three years later, both
Ricardo and Devon are prepared
to resume their yearly get-
tO_gether, when the NO. 12
Panthers travel to South Bend,
Ind., to face the seventh-ranked
Irish. Both players are looking
forward to the reunion.

“It’s a great feeling,” Devon
said. “I only see him three Or four
times a year. It’s a great feeling.”

For two Of the past three years,
Ricardo has spent the Christmas
holidays at home with his family
watching Devon and Notre Dame
play in holiday bowl games. This
year’s reunion takes on an added
twist, though, because for the
first time in their college careers,
RicardO’s team has the upper
hand. This season Pitt has the
better record — undefeated at 5-
0. Notre Dame is 4-1; their loss
was to Michigan’. "

Panther head coach Paul
Hackett has stated that one of the
reasons why players decide to
come to Pitt is to get an
opportunity to play Notre Dame.
Finally that time is here, and the
Panthers a-re ready for the

I challenge.

“It’s a big game,” Ricardo said.
“The attitude on the team is very
high. It’s a nationally televised

game, and we’re really looking
forward to it.”

One Of the reasons for Pitt’s
success this season has been the
performance Of the Panther
defense, which has played
admirably in each game. Ricardo
McDonald has played a big part
in that defense. For his
performance in the West Virginia
game, McDonald earned the Big
East’s ﬁrst—ever defensive player
of the week award. He's already
chalked up six sacks. In four
years he has yet to miss a game
and a start.

His coach has called him “as
fine a linebacker as there is in
college football” and considers
him to be ‘:1 “true impact player.”
“[Rica'rdO is] a ‘relentless, tireless
worker," Hackett said
emphatically. “[Hel epitomizes
what’s going on with this football

team — as a senior.”
The McDonald twins aren’t
taking this sibling. rivalry too

seriously, though. Both players
know that this isn't a life—or-death

situation but just another crucial
football game.

“Even though it’s a big game,
an important game, we're still

brothers,” said Notre Dame’s

Devon.

Ricardo is 0-3 against Notre‘

Dame in his career and would
love nothing more than to leaye

South Bend on Saturday with_a f 
victory under his belt. “I don't ,_  
think words can explain what a A

win would mean to me,” said the ’

Pitt linebacker. 
As for their parents, who will

“Just for the fact that I’ve_never
