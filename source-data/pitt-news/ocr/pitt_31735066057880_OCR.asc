Council voles to support Piﬂ Times

By Mark Gordon and
Stephanie Wright
The Pitt News

Pitt’s Senate Council voted 32-0 at yester-
day’s meeting on a resolution that will allow
the University Times to continue to be pub-
lished independently.

Senate Council President James Holland
said the newspaper is a valuable resource to
the university community.

‘The University Times, some 25 years in
existence, was created as an independent
paper,” Holland said. “It has journalistic
independence.”

Holland told the council that an individual
was hired by Pitt’s administration to review
how the paper operates.

“Recently, the university hired an outside
consultant. The recommendation seemed to
be headed toward making the University

Times more doctored to the university,”
Holland said.

Council member Philip Wion agreed with
the council’s decision on the vote.

“The University Times is a precious and
unique institution at this university. It is
quite rare in this country to have a college
newspaper of this kind to report fairly and
accurately like [the University Times] does,”
Wion said.

Holland described brieﬂy the history of
the University Tmtes and said that 11 years
ago the staff was cut from ﬁve employees
to only three. Because of those cutbacks, the
paper has had trouble covering all university
events, according to Holland.

“The University Times cannot cover
everything we would like to see covered. It
has a small staff,” Holland said. “We would
like to see the University Times become big-
ger and better and still remain independent.”

The council moved to support the inde-
pendence of the University Times because of
a controversial editorial decision from the
publisher Leon Haley.

Haley pulled a story out of the Sept. 15
issue that would have covered a gay wed-
ding in Heinz Chapel. That decision
prompted some university groups, such as
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance, to
criticize Haley for using censorship.

Senate Council reaffirmed that censorship
is not a part of the newspaper and that it
must be continued to run independently.

“It will be a great loss to change the mis-
sion of the University Times,” Wion said.

Also, the council received copies of
“Toward the 21st Century,” a booklet
explaining academic plans for the future at
Pitt.

Senator Wofford's son speaks, to UDs

By LeeAnne Mitchell
For The Pitt News

U.S. Senator Ham's Wofford’s
son spoke to the University
Democrats last night about the
difficulties of being a
Democratic candidate right
now.

“It’s a tough time to stand up
for Democratic values right
now. People are very angry, and
they want a change — a big
change,” said David Wofford,
press secretary of his father’s re-
election campaign.

The Wofford campaign is
based on a need for government
action and change. Wofford said
his father’s campaign wants to
see a change in health care sys-
tems as well as a change in

unwarranted governmental

spending.
Wofford said Rick Santorum,
the Republican candidate, wants

to “go back” to an 80’s ‘system

..of trickle-down economics

based on tax cuts for the
wealthy and increased defense
spending.

“[The Wofford campaign]
wants a government that will be
there for the people when they
need us. We want to see a major
decrease in discretionary spend-
ing. There has been a reduction
of 200,000 federal employees,
and the budget deﬁcit has gone
down three years in a row. Why
change that now?” Wofford
asked.

Wofford said Santorum wants
to implement a health care plan
that will only benefit the
“healthy, wealthy and young.”
This plan is an IRA-type invest-
ment plan where people put into
an accotlit to draw from when
they become ill.

Wofford said that this type of
plan is “ridiculous” and asked,

“Where are non-wealthy pwple

V going to come up with the

money to put into this account?”
His father supports a plan of
universal coverage health care.

“[Rick Santorum] is a guy
who is dangerous to the welfare
of this state. He talks out of both
sides of his mouth and says
what people want to hear,”
Wofford said.

Other University Democrats
business included:

-Greg Marchand stepped
down as vice president, and Eric
Schultz was appointed.

°There will be a Mike Doyle
campaign rally on Wednesday,

Oct. 19 at Pittsburgh
International Airport from 7-9
p.m.

-Volunteers are being orga-
nized to help with phone banks
and door—knocking for the
Wofford, Mark Singel and Mike
Doyle campaigns.

comparisons

”Benchmarks”

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

By compiling statistics of
how Pitt compares to other
universities in various areas
into a complete booklet, the
university can see where
improvement is needed.

According to Leon Haley,
vice chancellor for student
and public affairs, the book-
let “Selected Benchmarks”
goes hand-in-hand with the
strategic long-range plan-
ning of the university.

“Selected Benchmarks,”
compiled by the Office of
the Chancellor and derived
from a variety of sources,
profiles Pitt, a member of
the Association of American
Universities (AAU), as it
compares to the 57 other
public and private AAU
schools in the United States
and Canada.

Pitt’s enrollment during
the fall term of 1992 was
27,852 —- ranking 20th of
the public schools and 21st
overall.

Largest overall was the
University of Minnesota
(public) with 54,671, while
last overall was California
Institute of Technology (pri-
vate) with 2,009. The medi-
an public enrollment was
33,577, and the median pri-
vate enrollement was
10,945.

Pitt’s percentage of black
and minority students
enrolled ranked seventh of
the public schools and 11th

(Dr. Robert Gallagher is
the director of Pitt's
Counseling Center.)

One of the nice things
about writing this column
is that I get a lot of letters
from students and others in
the university community.
Sometimes they just want
to comment on something
in a previous column that
was helpful to them. At
other times
they write
about prob-
lems that
they are hav-
ing and ask
me either to
respond to
them directly
or to address
their concerns in a future
column.

Many of the letters are
lengthy and quite detailed.
The writers often describe
troubling incidents that
happened to them, person-
al dilemmas that they are
struggling with, some
unresolved angry feelings
that they are experiencing
or their fears about what
kind of person they are or
about what the future

 

holds for them. Others may
write of a crisis of cbn-
science, of concerns about
their sexuality, of fears
about their ability to love
or to be loved or of numer-
ous other themes -that are
part of the human experi-
ence.

When the letters are
anonymous I am some-
times concerned about not
being able
to contact
the writer,
but I reas-
s u r e
in y s e l f
that the
writing of
the letter
. v-..  in
itself, probably therapeu-
tic. All of us, I think, need
a place or a format to talk
about our more troubling
thoughts. In fact, one of
the important contributions
of people in the counseling
professions is that they
provide an environment in
which people can “speak
the unspeakable” i.e., share
in a confidential setting
their innermost thoughts

and feelings.

For some people, letter
writing provides this kind of
opportunity. The expression
of the problem, even in an
anonymous letter, helps the
writer bring the problem into
focus, feel less alone with the
problem and perhaps begin a
process that may eventually
lead to a resolution of the
problem.

Of course it is not neces-
sary to write to a therapist to
achieve these benefits. Many
people find that a timely let-

ter to a family member or
friend is a useful way of dis-
cussing some concerns that
are difficult to share face to
face. Others write letters
which are never meant to be
mailed that provide them with
an opportunity to express
their intense feelings of anger
or hurt or even love. Others,
on occasion, have found it
helpful to write a letter to
themselves from a parent or
significant other, which
includes all the things they
wished the person could say
to them — knowing that such

expression will probably
never happen. All of these
approaches can have thera-
peutic value.

In any event, I am apprecia-
tive of the letters that I
receive from readers of this
column. I read them, think
about them and learn from
them. I encourage you to keep
writing and also, of course, to
remain open to the possibility
of coming to our Counseling
Center (334' William Pitt
Union) to talk about any con-
cern that is interfering with
your college life.

  Opinions

Iraq is back

Sadaam Hussein has once again appeared in the news the
last few days as Iraq has amassed 70-80,000 troops on the
border of Kuwait. The response from Bill Clinton and the
United States has been swift and sure. A 36,000-strong U.S.
ground force is being sent to the Persian Gulf along with
about 550 aircraft. _

The quick and strong action by President Clinton is refresh-
ing. He has long been justly criticized for acting too slowly
and tentatively in international affairs. There is definitely
something to be said for careful analysis of foreign policy. It
is, however, also an arena in constant ﬂux, and he who stands
around may be left out in the cold.

.Unfortunately, while the president deserves praise for his
current action, it makes all the more glaring the general incon-
sistencies in U.S. foreign policy — inconsistencies which
extend far beyond the Clinton administration. With U.S.
troops involved in active intervention in both Haiti and the
Middle East, there has been renewed discussion of the United
States’ policing of the world. The justification given for U.S.
intervention in both of these regions has been the upholding
justice, human rights, freedom and democracy. However, the
most glaring violation of these “freedoms” (with genocide
thrown in for good measure) since World War"II has been
largely ignored by the U.S. and the international community.
We are referring of course to the Bosnian situation, in which
not only has the United States not intervened, but the continu-
ation of the arms embargo has put the Bosnian Muslims at a
decided disadvantage compared to the Serbians, whom the
international community have generally decried.

This raises the question then of what exactly does drive
U.S. foreign policy. The answer sadly enough may be nothing.
While economics plays a large role, that cannot answer the
intervention in Haiti. However, our foreign policy interven-
tion strategy is not based simply on freedom and justice for
all. It is time for the United States to formulate a consistent
foreign policy stance, rather than simply to play politics, both
domestically and abroad, every time a new foreign crisis aris-
es. - ‘

The current Iraqi situation has really been a no—brainer for
Clinton. Considering the massive amounts of public support
behind the Gulf War, Clinton has hardly had tobuck public
opinion like he did in Haiti. Also, he reacted quickly, for
once, before public opinion could become-entrenched one
way or the other — a policy Bush and Reagan orchestrated to
perfection. ‘

Finally, Clinton must be sure not to make the same mistakes
Bush did. The reason the-U.S. is again involved in this morass
is because Bush did not finish the original job by removing
Hussein from power. If there is any type of intervention in
Iraq, beyond massing troops at the border, it should involve
the removal — by -whatever means necessary — of Saddam
Hussein.

Pr taste displayed by lawyers

ost
o f
the

people of
Pittsburgh,
as well as
this newspa-
 fir, applaud-

    

Colt ed the local
Kathi media for
Metinko their delicate

handling of
the tragedy of Flight 427 a
few weeks ago.

The media received such
commendation because they
are usually perceived as
being after the sensational
and caring little for the feel-
ings and reputations of peo-
ple who get in their way.
Such sensationalism often
involves graphic pictures and
accounts of the news.
Perhaps this is why many of
the local stations have begun
broadcasting “family sensi-
tive” news.

What we are now learning,
however, is that we should
not have feared the news
media. The people we should
have feared are the lawyers.
Recent news accounts reveal
these are the true culprits
who disregard people’s pri-
vacy and feelings.

I don’t mean to say that all
lawyers are like this. After
all, I am among the many
attempting to join the ranks.
However, as the saying goes,
one bad apple spoils the
bushel. And in this case, it is
many more than one.

Lawyers for a long time
now have been trying to
overcome the stereotype of
the sleazing ambulance-
chasing litigator who will
stop at nothing to win. Of
course, winning more for
himself at the end than for
his client.

The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette_ reported on Oct. 2,
1994, a Houston attorney,
John O’Quinn, has a high-

tech approach to courting _

clients. O’Quinn sent a five-
minute videotape to the
families of the victims of
Flight 427. The video appar-
ently opens with O’Quinn
expressing his heartfelt
condolences to the families.
He then proceeds to try to
convince the families that
they must act now; warning
that USAir already has a
team of attorneys working
on the case. He also includes
video of the wreckage of
the USAir flight which

7 crashed in Charlotte, N.C.,

in July. That flight killed
37 of the passengers on
board.

O’Quinn’s tape concludes
with reproductions of the
newspaper headlines announ-
cing his previous trial suc-
cesses and offering an 800
number for families to call
with no obligation.

Most of the families have
been contacted through the
mail. Many friends and more
removed relatives have been
contacted by firms, at times
even offered bribes, to steer
their grieving families
toward a particular firm.

One relative, a paralegal,
was offered $80,000 if she
would persuade the family to
retain the law firm she
worked at, The Post-Gazette
reported. The paralegal
resigned. Another relative
said she has received letters
from lawyers all over the
country. She even received
letters overnight express
everyday the week after the
tragedy.

Five suits have already
been filed against USAir:
two in Pittsburgh, two in
Chicago, and one in
Cleveland. One relative filed
suit soon after the tragedy,
hoping to avoid the unsolicit-
ed mailings of attorneys
looking for the large settle-
ments. However, she is still
receiving the mailings.

Pennsylvania Rules for

Professional Conduct gov-
erning the behavior of
lawyers practicing in the
Commonwealth prohibit
attorneys from soliciting
perspective clients, like
families of disaster victims,
if the lawyer is not related
or has no prior employment
relationship when a reason
for the soliciting is the
attorney’s financial gain; or

if the physical, mental, or

emotional state of the per-
spective client leaves them
unable to exercise reasonable
judgment in employing a
lawyer.

This should become a uni-
versally accepted standard of
behavior for lawyers. It
seems as though it should be
an obvious standard of con-
duct among caring human
beings.

I think it is a shame that
the state Supreme Court has
to define this conduct as
unacceptable to prevent some
insensitive lawyer from
soliciting these grief-stricken
families.

I understand that this type
of conduct would not enter
the minds of many reputable
and competent attorneys, and
society may never achieve a
time when all lawyers have
more respect for human
beings and their feelings than
for their pocketbooks, but we
can hope.

A local band, The
Affordable Floors in their
song “Nothing Personal”
sing a line that seems
strangely appropriate at this
time. The line goes, “and it
seems a little queer, the only
ones making out here are the
lawyers.” It is a terrible com-
mentary on the tragedy when
we all are sending our
prayers to the families affect-
ed and attorneys send their
brochures instead.

Big East
teams
attack  
Top 25

plls
A33?

  

to regroup
after some
ﬁscouraging
losses, the
teams at the
Columnist other end of
Matt the Big East
Grotf Football
Conference
have put the brakes on the con-
ference’s slide out of the
national picture.

Until this weekend, the con-
ference was living down to its -
preseason criticism _as the “Big
Least,” supposedly losing
recruits and fans to other con-
ferences which have started
recruiting in Big East territory.

Most impressive in proving
Big East strength was Miarni’s
dismantling of third-ranked
Florida State, pushing the
defending national champions
out of the top ten for the ﬁrst
time since 1990. Miami has
bounced back from a loss to
Washington to position itself
for a national title bid and a No.
8 ranking in The Associated
Press poll.

Another huge step for Big
East respectability was Boston
College’s crushing of Notre
Dame’s national championship
hopes. Notre Dame is probably
the most proliﬁc tearri in col-
lege football, and for the sec-
ond straight year. Even with the
win, the Eagles are only in
fourth place in the Big East and
probably don’t deserve to be
any higher. BC’s victory vault-
ed them from being regarded as
a mediocre 1-2 Big East team
to receiving a No. 24 AP rank-
mg.

The AP rankings have ﬁnally
recognized Syracuse, which has
quietly assembled a 5-1 record
to earn a No. 18 place in the
polls. The ‘Cuse, whose only
loss was by one point to
Oklahoma, has risen above pre-
season ravings about its lack of
depth, especially in the wake of
quarterback Marvin Graves’
graduation. Quarterback Kevin
Mason has proved a worthy
successor by gaining a place as
one of the country’s top quar-
terbacks heading into this
week’s game against Temple,
which ought to pad his statistics
quite nicely.

Virginia Tech has been the
only Big East team which has
consistently lived up to favor-
able preseason hype, with the
exception of its loss to

’ Syracuse. With its games at BC

Midnight Saturday is madness

Pitt News File Photo

Senior Orlando Antigua runs through the excited crowd at Midnight Madness last year.

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

At the stroke of midnight
Saturday, college basketball
will come back to life across
the nation as well as at Pitt.

This phenomenon, Midnight

Madness, is the first date that

NCAA basketball teams can
begin practicing for the coming
season.

For the past two years,
NCAA regulations deemed that
practice could not begin until
Nov. 1. This year, the NCAA
passed legislation to move the

first day of practice back to
Oct. 15 where it has traditional-
ly been.

Kimball Smith, director of
Pitt’s athletic marketing, said
one of the reasons for the
switch is that a lot of coaches
felt they could n-ot get their
teams fully prepared in time for
the season. .

The Fitzgerald Field House
doors open Friday_at 10:30
p.m., and beyond those doors,
for the third consecutive year,
are prizes, contests, cheering
and Pitt’s men’s and women’s
basketball teams.

Men go undefeated

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

When sophomore Matt Mills
beat Canisius’ Victor Vanov in
straight sets, 6-1 6-4, yesterday
at the Cost Center, the Pitt
men’s tennis team clinched an
undefeated fall schedule in
dual matches for the second
year in a row.

Pitt (4-0) had a rough time
with a Canisius team that it
swept last year 7-0 but stole
victories in the top three seeds
as well as the top two doubles
matches to complete a 5-4 win.

“It was a closer match than
we had anticipated, but the
majority of our players had
positive performances,” Pitt
No. 1 seed Bradon Doherty
said.

“It’s been a good fall
course,” Pitt coach George
Dieffenbach said.

Doherty, who is 5-1 on the
season, struggled slightly with
Canisius’ Tim Grundtisch
before surviving 6-3, 6-4.

“I wasn’t serving as well as I
would’ve liked. My serve per-
centage was down, but I
volleyed reasonably well,
which made up for it,” Doherty
said.

Doherty’s was the first of
three wins for the day for Pitt’s
sophomore trio (Doherty, Brad
Wade and Mills), who are a
combined 15-5 this year while
competing as the top three

.s¢¢dS-. . . .

  
   

Jim (I Phographer
Doherty returns a serve.

Wade followed Doherty’s
victory with one of his own,
blowing out Ryan Thayer 6-1,
6-0.

“I had a lot of energy. I was
trying to hit the ball really
hard, and they were going in,”
Wade said.

The Panthers’ No. 4, 5 and 6
seeds all lost, but Pitt compen-
sated with two doubles victo-
ries. Doherty and Wade cruised
to an 8-2 win, and No. 2 dou-
bles Mills and junior Cyrus
Zolghadri squeaked out a win
in what became the turning
point in the match. Down 6-7
late in the match, the Pitt duo
came back strong to nip the
Canisius squad 9-7.

“Mills and Zolghadri really

    'TeImis,pa8¢9.

“The season is still far away,
but [Midnight Madness] is a
nice way to get the teams psy-
ched up,” Smith said. He also
said it would be ﬁrst—year head
men’s basketball coach Ralph
Willard’s introduction to the
student body.

Kirk Bruce, the head
women’s basketball coach, said
Midnight Madness gives the
students a chance to see the
women play and then perhaps
to come back to future games.

“We got a great amount of
enthusiasm [last year,]” Bruce
said. “We’re looking to bring

students to games.”

The teams will come out on
the ﬂoor following a count-
down at midnight and will
show the fans a preview of
what’s to come. The men’s bas-
ketball team will have a slam
dunk contest and three-point
shooting contest and will go
through a few drills. The
women’s team will split apart,
and members will compete
against one another in a formal
scrimmage.

This year, Midnight Madness
falls on Homecoming weekend,
which Pitt officials think will
add to the festivities.

Director of Student Activities
Joe Cavalla, who is also a
member of the Midnight
Madness Planning Committee,
said Friday night will be like a
three—ring circus since there
will also be a laser/fireworks
show and band (The Claiks) at
the Vlfilliam Pitt Union.

“That’s what Homecoming
should be,” Cavalla said.

Smith said last year’s atten-
dance was 3500, and he is

expecting a nice crowd this.

‘year as well because it falls on
Homecoming. 
“We hope students include
this in Friday night’s activi-
ties,” Smith said.
Cavalla said every year the
committee looks at what

Women's tennis
stretches wm streak

By Vicki Geubtner
Staff Writer

A lack of line judges caused
controversy for the Pitt
women’s tennis team even
though it defeated Canisius 6-
3, rocketing its overall record
to 6-4.

“She hooked me,” Marla
Zielinski said of her loss of 3-
6, 7-6, 3-6 to Canisius’ Robin
Rocchio.

For all you tennis fans, that
. m e a n s

Zielinski

accused

Rocchio

of cheat-

ing with

b a d

calls.

 

Zielinski, known for calling
out in self-frustration, said
Rocchio “refused to shake my
hand” because of her yelling
after the match.

“I don’t like to accuse an
opponent of being dishonest,
but a lot of her calls were just
bad,” Zielinski said.

Canisius head coach General
Bass commented on
Zielinski’s frustration as the
key to Rocchio’s win.

“I told Robin the longer
[Zielinski] screams at herself,
the longer it means she’s not
pleased with her playing,"

Bass said.

“It’s tough to look at the
line, the ball and concentrate
on your game at the same
time,” Zielinski said.

The reason for all this con-
fusion is that the matches
don’t have judges making the
calls; that’s up to the players
discretion.

“The school should make it

a work study,” Tamara
Kalesnik said regarding line
judging.

At least Kalesnik didn’t
have to deal with the grunting
that plagued last week’s
match. She easily won her sin-
gles match 6-0, 6-2.

“I hit my ground strokes
well and attacked her serve,”
Kalesnik said, attributing her

recent wins to her ability to’

“tum it around.”

Alison Baker resumed her
No. 1 singles status after her
illness last week. Taking a few
days off to recover helped her
endurance as she handily
defeated Canisius’ Wendy
Lewis 6-2, 6-2.

“Alison definitely needed
time to recuperate,” coach
George Dieffenbach said.

“I had energy when I needed
it,” Baker said.

She needed to reserve it
going into her doubles match
with a visibly upset Tammy

Keister commented on
Rocchio’s “dinky” style of
play as the reason Keister was
“more hesitant” in her game.

eight wins.

“Alison and I are really
working well together,”
Keister said.

“I wasn’t going to lose
another doubles game,”
Keister said.

Zielinski and Fran Davis
continued their doubles domi-
nance by winning 8-5 in pro
sets.

Both players agreed their
win wasn’t as dramatic as last
week’s win over Robert
Morris. .

“I couldn’t get my head into
it,” Davis said. “I just wanted
a quick win.”

Despite being sick, Davis
continued her undefeated sin-
gles streak by wiping out

 
   

Abena Youngblood 6-1, 6-2.

Confidence has definitely
been building for ther—:Lady
Panthers as they’ve won their
past four matches.

Dieffenbach rationalized
that the new players and
returning ones “give us a lot
more depth.

“We’re finally a good team
unit.”

Their unity will be tested as
they face “one of the strongest
teams this year,” said
Dieffenbach, when they face
Bucknell this Saturday at 10
a.m. at the Cost Center.

“It gives us something to
work hard for for the next cou-
ple days before we taper off
on Friday,” Dieffenbach said.

The Big Ten must pray for

Florida State, the big hope of

The Pitt News, Wednesday, October 12, 1994

Madness

°From page 7
worked at previous Midnight
Madnesses as well as new
ideas. ,

This year, a new addition will
be a scrimmage between some
alumnae from the women’s
basketball team and current Pitt
students.

Also new are impersonation
contests. A student can win a
free ESPN jacket by imitating
ESPN ’s Dick Vitale. Smith said

the contestants have to talk for
20 seconds and will be judged
on enthusiasm, appearance and
impersonation. All contestants
must preregister by calling 648-
8247.

By impersonating Panther
Paul doing the “Hey!” song, a
student can also win a prize.
Contestants will be called out
of the stands to perform along
with the Pitt band while being
judged by Panther Paul himself.

Students also have the chance
to win $200 by sinking one shot
if they are randomly chosen out
of the audience. Students can
also be randomly chosen to go
up against Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, Willard and
Pittsburgh Steelers tight end
Eric Green in a free throw
shooting contest.

The grand door prize of the
night is a trip for two to the
Pitt-Miami basketball game at

Miami on Feb. 1, while a stu-
dent who makes ashot from
three quarters of the way down
the court will win a 1995
Saturn.

Midnight Madness will also
be the introduction of the Field
House Phantom which will
continue throughout both men’s
and women’s basketball games
during the season. Clues about
where a special basketball is
hidden on campus will be

given. The prize, if it is found,
will be a trip to see the
“Phantom of the Opera” in
New York City, according to
Smith.

Admission is free, and shut-
tles will be running from the
William Pitt Union to the Field
House every 10 minutes start-
ing at 10:30 p.m. After
Midnight Madness, the shuttles
will run back to the union until
2 a.m.
