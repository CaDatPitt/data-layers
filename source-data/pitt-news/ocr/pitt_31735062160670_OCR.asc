Midday Series
Changes Date

For Program

The Midday Series Com-
mittee has announced that
Dr. Thomas Parran will speak
tomorrow in Stephen Foster
Memorial rather than today

in the Student Union as pre-

viously scheduled.

The retiring Dr. Parran has
served as an administrator at the
University for ten years as Dean
of the Graduate School of Public
Health.

Before coming to the University,
Dr. Parran held the position of
Surgeon General of the U. S. Pub-
lic Health Service for twelve
years.

He served on a special mis-
sion to Japan in 1956 to report
on the program of the Atomic
Bomb Casualty Commission in
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Heading a pﬁve—man Public
Health Mission to the Soviet
Union, Dr. Parran observed medi-
cal education, research and health
programs in that country. '

Dr. William Swartzbaugh, di-
rector of the Student Union has
announced future programs plan-_

the appearance.

Dr. Ley has been an expon-
ent of space travel since 1925,
He wrote a‘ book entitled TRIP
INTO SPACE in 1926, which
was one of the earliest works on
the space travel theory.

The writer-scientist was born in
Berlin, Germany, in 1906.

Ley was a founder of “Society
for Space Travel” in Germany. In
1929, he was made vice-president
and co-editor of the monthly jour-
nal of this organization.

In 1934, he left Germany and i

came to the United States, where
he became a citizen in 1944.

The scientist said in 1955. “I
want to contribute to future
conquest of space and would
like to be held responsible to
some extent for coming age of
space travel.” _

Ley said on Oct. 7 that the U.S.
could have launched a satellite a

year ago except that the tracking
system was not ready. ’ —

Last November 4, Drs. Ley,
Hagen, Newell, and Siry discussed
problems and likely methods of
bringing back the Soviet space dog
alive. '

Dr. Ley spoke to a New York
Youth Forum on Nov. 25 stating
that the U.S. was one year be-
hind the USSR in space ‘re-
search.

Other ‘scientific works include:
Possibility of Spcae Travel, 1928;
Days of Creation, 1941; Bomb and
Bombing 1941; Shells and Shoot-
ing, 1942; Rockets, 1944; Rockets
and Space Travel, 1947; Conquest
of Space, 1949.

THE POWER OF POSITIVE WRINKLING

While everybody knows that
the soft collar on Van Heusen
Century Shirts won't wrinkle,
ever, a Van Heusen survey
among college students has
revealed that precious few
know why. Here are some of
the responses’:

J. L.—sophomore at the
Psychodynamic Institute for
Arts, Crafts, and Number Paint-
ing—-—“Obviously, the collar
won’t wrinkle, because it’s
afraid to wrinkle. It may have
been threatened by some surly
Van Heusen vice-president.
Ergo, it exhibits the Cavandish
anti-wrinkle syndrome.”

G. F.——~junior at Usury
SchoolofAdvertising——“ColIar-
wise, there’s no demand for
wrinkles. No customer beneﬁt.
Now, this is strictly off the
top of my cranium, but the

~ statement, ‘the soft collar that

won’t wrinkle, ever,” is too
negative. Substitute ‘never’ for

"ever’ and you not only have

a positive statement—~—but——-
as demonstrated by that
famous cigarette, this
ungrammatical concept will be
attention-getting.”

L. V.——semb_r quarterback at
Jlliltown College——“I wouldn’t,,,
be without a Van Heusen.
Look here . . . under my pleat-
less shoulder pads. See? Out
of simple decency, the collar
refrains from wrinkling. It’s
this kind of restraint that
recently led to our glorious
victory over Birdbrain U. Not
a man was scathed. Huzzah for
the collar—-and ﬁght furiously,
fellows.”

Yes, this is the kind of
ignorance we ru.n across.
Actually, while other collars
are made of 3 pieces of mate-
rial, the secret of this soft collar
with its wrinkle-shunning
qualities is one-piece con-

struction. Van Heusen Cen- .

tury shirts come in 5 collar
styles.’ $4 and $5. ‘

’~—..

By Gordon Clowney

In recent years the technique of many profes-
sional ad men has changed from guessing about
why we; as consumers, buy the products we do to
‘employing a systematic means by which they can
probe our hidden or subconsciousldesires. ’

This new type of systematicgapproach is known A

as motivation research. The head
of a Chicago research‘ ﬁrm that
conducts psychoanalytically ori-
ented studies for merchandisers,
Louis "Cheskin, describes M.R.,
as itis commonly referred to, as
follows: C ‘
“Motivation research is the

type of research that seeks to
learn what motivates people in
making choices. It employs tech-
niques designedto reach the un-
conscious or subconscious mind’

 

‘because preferences generally are determined by

factors ofxwhich the individual is not conscious . . .
Actually in the buying situation the consumer
generally acts emotionally and compulsively, un-
«consciously reacting to the images and designs
which in «tlﬂee subconscious are associated with the
products”, ‘  "

In other words the trend is toward ﬁnding what
people ‘want by not letting them know what in-
formation is being sought’ instead of coming‘‘ right
out and asking them why theymbuy the pijodlucts
they do. ‘ ' _

—The reasons behind this new approacli as well
as the effectiveness achieved by the motivational

researchers is the subject of one lof the current”
bestsellers, The Hidden Persuaders, (David McKay

"Company, Inc., $4).

T Written by Vance Packard, a former newspa-_
perman, The Hidden Persuaders provides the read— A

er’with.an_introduction to this new age of manipu-
lation inrwhich the consumer’s mind is being picked
to provide the basis for mo1'<=§r'effective selling ap-
peals. A . B ‘N
Packard brings out three A basic assumptions

about the buying public that marketing and adver- ’
B tising men have become increasingly aware of. The
ﬁrst is you can’t assume that people know what

they want. .

A Soapbox Or Ad Platform  . .

By Murray Chess

Studentepolitical parties locally have but one

real purpose. That is to get a strong segment of
students together, slate candidates, and try to get
those “candidates elected to ofﬁces.

En route, to this goal the parties throw in one

other service-, merely because it is something that
automatically goes along with
political campaigns and parties.
This is the famous platform on
which parties base their cam-
paigning. , O

In politics at Pitt the would-
be politicians draw up platforms,
but usually- make them as gen-
eral as possible. In fact, they
make them so general that nine
times out of ten they mean noth-
ing.

,And in the one“, case where .
a plank of the platfrom saws something, the party
doesn’t carry out its promise.

Let us take as examples the platforms of last
year’s political parties. One of the planks of the
All-Campus Party’s platform stated that the stu-
dents of that party proposed “more active support
of our total athletic program to instill among the
student body a deeper appreciation’, of —Pittsburgh’s
excellent athletic, record.” . -

Now what does this say? Actually, it has little
meaning, if any at all.

Overesﬁmafjng Abilities
The same party also included in its platform
proposals for “. . . better facilities and prices in a
true University bookstore, completion of the Ca-
thedral’s new library housed in aseparate building
. . .” These points are deﬁnite, but have theylbee
carried out, or at least. worked on. "
We have heard of no one who has made any
effort to abcomplish these proposals. ,
The platform of the All-University Party, said
it supported “promoting more frequent social func-
tions for all University students, promoting an ex-

it panded All-University program in the area of stu-

dent—faculty relations.”
, It’ is true that these points have been carried

out, but the credit for it cannot go to the members 

of vars tr P. ty Merely e.

survey. Most of the people interviewed said they

would prefer another type the company was con- H

sidering. g
' When thevcompany went to the expense of
bringing out this other bottle in test markets, it was
overwhelmingly rejected in favor of the old bot-
tle, even by people who had favored it in inter-
views.”
The second assumption pointed out is that you

M can’t assume people will tell you the truth about

their wants and dislikes even if they know them. A’
group of people were asked if they borrowed

‘V money from personal-loan companies.
Every person said no. Some of them Virtually.
, shouted their answer. The truth was that all those

selected for interviewing were people who were

‘listed in the records of a local loan company as

borrowers.”

’Other people were asked by an ad agency why’-

they didn’t buy one'c1ient’s product, kippered her-
ring. “The main3reason the people gave under di-
rect questioning was that they just didn’t like the
taste of kippers. , '

More“ persistent, however, uncovered ‘the fact

that 40 per cent of the people who said they didn’t'

like the taste of kippers had never, in their entire

T lives, tasted kippers!”

The third assumption Packard brings out is that
it is dangerous for marketers to assume. that people
can be‘ trusted to behave in a rational way. .. ,

lffsd No Bargain
“A department store ‘that had become skeptical

‘of the rationality of its customers tried an experi- «

ment. One of its slowest moving items was priced
at fourteen cents.
twenty-nine cents. Sales promtply increased 30 per
cent when the item was offered at this ‘bargain?
price.” . l

These are just a ‘few of the illustrations used to
show’ why’ psycholanalysing the buying public is

coming more and more to replace a more direct,

attempt at finding the answers.
In The Hidden Persuaders, Packard has. pre-

It changed the price to 2 for

sented not ‘only an introduction to a new concept W

in marketing goods and services, but also a very
vivid and revealing picture of what makes the
American buyer “tick.” Emotion, _not logic, is the
greatest persuader. 

Planks Or Pretense

accomplish them. . .

One plank which was never brought up after
the elections was that which said, f‘To_ establish
co—educational government in the class officer area.”

This-is a good point, but it serves no purpose on a,

platform if it isn’t _handled after the election.
‘Ex Post Facfo '

Both parties mentioned that they would work»

for better governmental setup, but as they very A

well knew/ that problem was already being worked
on and lneetled no pusrrfrom them.

By treating platforms in a manner such as this,
the students are passing up a good chance to do

something actually constructive for the University.‘

At the present time conditions here are in a
state of almost constant change. There is room for
more and moreistudent thinking, student sugges-
tion and student accomplishment. The party that
would make strides toward these ﬁelds would be
a wise group. - A I

Those at the head of the parties currently in
formation have more than the intelligence it takes
to write and run on a solid and meaningful plat-
form.

The accomplishment of such a platform could
be placed along side the new Student Government

Association in helping to give Pitt a solid and con- _

structive and advancing government

Rates, ‘Music Man,’ ‘Angel’ as Highlights

English Prof Sees

10 Current Shows

In New York City

By ROSALIE GLAND

Highlighting an otherwise
mediocre theatrical season on
Broadway this year were the
productions of “The Music
Man” and “Look Homeward
Angel.”

“‘ Dr. Ford E. Curtis, of the Eng-
lish department, viewed these and
eight other plays during a recent
New York trip to review current
Broadway shows.

“The Music Man,” according to ‘

Dr. Curtis, deserves the high
praise it has received. By Mere-
dith Wilson, a music man in his
own right, it owes much of its ex-
cellence in the theatre to its lead-
ing man, Robert Preston. *
Preston Tries Broadway

“One of the greatest delights of
a theatre-goer,” he stated, “is to
be able to’ see an actor mature.”

‘Eight years ago Preston decided
he had his fill of the heavy
assignments Hollywood had been
offering him to try his luck on
Broadway. "7 “

“An unaffected and warm
personality, Preston had never
sung or danced in a musical, but
one would never realize this
upon seeing the ‘Music Man’.”

Preston plays the part of a
salesman of band instruments who
travels to a small town to sell
band equipment to the schools. He
electriﬁes the town by his sales-
manship,~proclaiming that “a band
would keep the boys out of the
local pool halls.”

“'76 Trombones’ Is Favorite I

He intends to skip town before
it ﬁnds out that he knows nothing
about music. Complications arise
when he falls in love with the
town librarian.

p The catchy tune, “76 Trom-

"'bones,” was Dr. Curtis’ favorite.
Others include “Marian” the Li-
brarian”_ and “Goodnight My
Someone.” “The Music Man is
reported to be sold out for two
years.

Dr. Curtis commented favorably
upon “Look Homeward Angel,"
based on the novel by Thomas
Wolfe and starring Anthony Per-
kins. .
“Li’l Abner Delightful «
“Gangling Tony Perkins captures
admirably‘ the /awkardness, the
uncertainties of a 17-year-old who
tries to free himself from the con-

'ﬂicts that rage about him at

home.”

Another “delightful” Broad-
way musical is “Li’l Abner,” an
original musical comedy based
on the characters created by Al
Capp-.

“One doesn’t have to be a Sadie
Hawkins to enjoy the fast, almost
dancing pace, of this production,’,’
Dr. Curtis remarked.‘ 4
Captures Low Brow Philosophy

“ ‘Progress Is the Roof of All
Evil’ rendered by General Bull-
moose (Howard St. John) was a
ﬁrst-rate song in that it captured
the‘ low brow philosophy of the
Dogpatchers in hillbilly terms.”

Dr. Curtis considered as the

most enjoyable song, “The Mat- '

rimonial Stomp,” sung by Mar-
ryin’ Sam (Stubby.Kaye). Peter
Palmer plays Li’! Abner with
Joyce Gladmond as Daisy Mae.
.Pitt’s Broadway reviewer gave a
good report on the comedy “Fair
Game” starring Sam Levene. The
plot revolves around a young and
beautiful divorcee who comes ‘to
New York to major in socioligy at

V NYU.

Trounce Covies, .109-74

N.C.A.A. Tournament bound Panther basketball team
faces the Westminster Titans tomorrow night at New Wil-
mington afler solidly trouncing the Geneva Covies 109-74
at the Field House last Monday night. The Blue and Gold
meet the Nittany Lions of Penn State in the ﬁnal home game
of the season on Saturday night at the Field House.

In an earlier contest the Bluee

and Gold rallied to beat the Tall
Titans 72-57. The duel between
Don Hennon and Mike Swahik
turned into a dud as the defense
of both offset each other.

’Dave Rankin of Mckeesport is

pacing the Titan. attack with a
'21 point average. Last Saturday
night he broke all existing

‘ Westminster records with a 39

point_ performance against In-{J
diana Teachers College. This
broke the record of 38 held by
McKeesporter, Jim .
Riley, who has since graduated.

The Staters bring their 7-8 re-
cord tothe Field House Saturday
and will probably use their famed
zone defense. Co—captaining the
Lions will be Ron Rainey and
Steve Baidy. Other starters for
Coach John Egli are Wally Coleu-
der, Ted Kubista, and Bob Ed-
wards.

Hennon put on a show for the
home fans last Monday as he
poured 41 points through the hoop.
Henonn hit for 57 per cent by bit-
ting for 17 ﬁeld goals out of 30
attempts. Julie Pegues became the

fourth player toyhit 1000 points“ games will be played Monday at

for the Panthers in three seasons.
Pegues scored 19 points, many on
the ‘fast breakthat was working
to perfection.

lThe 109 points rolled up by
Panthers eclipsed all previous

Field House records with much to ’

spare. The Field House record was
held by Ohio State when Robin
Freeman and his team racked up
98 against the Blue and Gold.

Grapplers End Season «
Against Penn State Foe

By JIM LACEY

A down-trodden Penn State wrestling team is the ﬁnal
hurdle for the Panthers to clear. This year’s Staters coached
by Charles Spiedel have won only one meet of six not in-
cluding a 14-14 tie with Maryland.

Both the Panthers and the Lions will be missing experi-
enced wrestlers. The Blue and Gold will be missing Tom

Alberts, previously injured in the-O

Mankato meet, and Ted Bienkow-
ski, injured in his match with
Dick Santoro of Lehigh. Earl
Proust, 147 pound ‘Lion veteran.
was lost for the season with a
‘shoulder separation in the Syra-
cuse meet. -

Both coaches will present a
jumbled line-up. Coach Peery
will go with Paul Powell (123)
and Sherm Moyer (130). Vic
DeFelice will weigh in at 137
pounds with Bob Sentner re’-
placing Bienkowski at the 147
slot. ’ _
Bob Richardson will wrestle at
157 while Dave Johnson comes in
at 167 pound limit. Alex Skirpan
weighs in at the 177 pounds as he
replaces Alberts. Tony Vuocolo or
Tom Hall will vie for the Heavy-
weight position.
Coach Spiedel will have to jug-
gle his line-up to make it present-
able. Only Johnny Johnston,

.1-

N.C.A.A. 130 pound champ, is a
ﬁxture in Spiedel’s line-up. Other
probable starters will include Jack
Maher (123) and Dan Johnston»
(137). -

Guy Guccioni and Sam Minor
will wrestle at 147 and 167
pound slots, while George Gray
subs for the injured Proust.
Henry Barone will wrestle at
177 while Ray Pottios appears
to have landed the Heavyweight
berth. T -

The Panthers held the favored
Lehigh Engineers to a 14-14 tie as
the Engineers came from behind
in the last match with Pete David-
son edging Vuocolo, 9-7.

Powell kept his win streak alive
as he pined Dave D’Antonio at
1:50 of the first epriod. Moyer de-
feated Leon Harbold, 4-3, but wins

conveys the thought that “Looking
to‘ the past is futile” and “Life is
for those who can face up to the
present.” _ '
“.‘Summer of the 17th Doll’
has considerable merit as an ob-
servation on life. It has travelled
far to reach us. Originating in
Australia, it was so successful
that it was taken intact to Lon-
don and ﬁnally to Broadway.

“An excellent serious produc-
tion is ‘The Dark at the Top of
the Stairs’ by William Inge. This is
his fourth hit since 1950. Others
were ‘Come Back Little Sheba,’
‘Picnic,’ and ‘Bus Stop’.”

Inge’s Least Successful

It is his least successful play,
though Dr. Curtis feels it has more
meat than 7 out of 10 plays on

‘ Broadway.

The scene is Oklahoma, 1920.1
The father of two children has
alwaystlived an outdoor type of
life. Now his wife wants him to
take a store job in town. He is
a blustery, vulgar man (Pat
Hingle) who reveals inner fears.

“The title, Dr. Curtis explained,
reveals the theme of the play-
“Man can rarely conﬁde his fears.
Darkness of limited communica-
tion is present even in close rela-
tionships.”

Her Life Is Dark

1 An “excellent” performance was
given by Eileen Heckart who was
previously seen as the mother of
the murdered boy in “The Bad
Seed” and a small-town teacher in

L 3., “Picnic.” She portrays the wife’s

sister. . ‘
/ Married to a Tulsa dentist.
she is envied for her ideal mari-
tal life. However. she too, has
darkness in her life.
Dr. Curtis also viewed “Roman-
cit and Juliet,” written by and

up starring Peter Ustinov, and “Sun-
. rise at Campobe1lo.” The latter is

the most recent in New York, and
is an historical play by Dore
Schary, starring Ralph Bellamy as
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

“An historical play,” says Dr.
Curtis, “is different in that the
audience knows what will happen.
The interest lies in why and how

 it happens.”
