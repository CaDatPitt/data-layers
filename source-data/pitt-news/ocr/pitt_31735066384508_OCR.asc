Tuition Hike to Face Vote by University Trustees

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s senior staff will recomment
a tuition increase, effective spring
term, at tomorrow’s Board of
Trustees meeting, but the amount
of the hike is not yet known.

Vice Chancellor for Budget and
Planning Jack Freeman said he will
"meet with Chancellor Posvar today
to determine the ﬁnal ﬁgure.
“We’re still uncertain what re-

commendation will go to the

trustees, ” he said.

The Chancellor, in his budget
message, has already stated that
tuition will be increased in the
spring‘“just to get (Pitt) through
this current ﬁscal year.”

According to Edward Bozik,
executive assistant to the Chancel-
lor, the increases will apply to
spring and summer sessions and
the spring term. He said the hike

“We’ll decide on that downstream.
We still have legislative action in
front of us. We’re hopeful the
legislature will increase it,” he
said.

A spring tuition increase of 6.5
percent was discussed at a Senate
Budget Policies Committee meet-
ing Feb. 3, but Freeman said
yesterday that amount was “mere-
ly a ballpark planning ﬁgure.”

“The 6.5 ﬁgure was more of a
’for instance’ than a proposal,“
Freeman said. “Things have
changed considerably since then.”

“We still don’t know how much
the hike will be,” he added.

“We’ll be putting everything
together tomorrow.”

Student Government Board pre-
sident Josh Baylson said yesterday
he was invited to speak before the
Trustees and will call on the
University to “stand up to the

“But I don’t think it will do any
good,” Baylson said. “The

Pitt’s Academic/ Research Priority:

For some time, Dr. Robert Marshall,
dean of the College of A rts and Sciences
at Pitt, has been outspokenly critical of
some University academic policies. The
announcement in early January of his
resignation, effective June 30, 1978, has
resulted in an increased focus on those
criticisms.

On Jan. 13, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette ran an editorial supportive of
Dr. Marshall and critical of the Univer-
sity. Several days later, the Post-
Gazette ’s letters to the editor section
was ﬁlled with protests from Pitt faculty
and administrators; subsequently, Dean
Marshall and others replied. The issues
raised in these brief exchanges remain a
subject of controversy among many Pitt
faculty and students.

Today, The Pitt News presents excer-
pts from a recent interview that dealt
with some of these issues—a joint inter-
view with Dean Marshall and Dr. David
Powers, associate provost of the
University.

The interview was conducted, and the
transcript edited, by Pitt News editorial
page editor Gary Govert, who was
assisted by news editor Rich Harry.

The Pitt News: Dean Marshall, was
your resignation tendered under
protest of any sort, or was it simply
a matter of form and indicative of a
desire to return to teaching?
Marshall: I’m not sure how to deal
with that alternative because it’s
not really in protest, but it’s not
merely a matter of form, either. As
I said in my letter of resignation
and in all the interviews, I had
three reasons for resigning.
One was my own personal desire
to return to the full life of a faculty

member——teaching and writing. It

doesn’t mean I’m ﬁnsished with
administration. There might be a
time in the future when I’d want to
return to it here or elsewhere, but
the primary moving concern was to
return to the faculty.

The second concern was the
nature of the office I held. I think
there should be some turnover in
administration anyway, but
particularly in an ofﬁceilike CAS,
which is very much a student-
oriented office. I think what is
needed more than anything in that
office is a certain level of
enthusiasm and activity. When
you’re dealing with students
directly, Ithink the last thing in the
world you want is someone who’s
jaded or too comfortable in the
position. So I think the deanship
should‘ turn over, and ﬁve years is
quite long enough to be Dean of
CAS.

The third reason is that I’m
dissatisﬁed with many of the

directions American higher educa-
tion is going in. I disagree with
many of these directions. And
therefore in the various interviews I
explained that was part of my
reason. If I were more pleased with
how things were going, I might
have overcome one of the other two
reasons for resigning, at least for
the time being.

I don’t believe this adds up to
resigning in protest. A signiﬁcant
reason for my resignation was
general discouragement with the
failure to cause changes I might
like to see. You can see, in a sense,
it’s not an either/ or situation.

Q. Do teaching and research
receive equal emphasis at Pitt?

Powers: I think the debate is often
portrayed as a kind of teaching
versus research issue, which Ithink
is a mistake. The administration is
strongly supportive of excellence in

who cares more than anything else
about the quality of undergraduate
instruction. Our perspective
probably differs a little bit because

-I’m also worried about the other
major missions a big university like
this one has.

Unlike the colleges, we also have
a mission for graduate and
professional education. That
mission, which essentially is
represented in the 136 doctoral
programs, is to prepare people to
do a different kind of thing than
what we’re trying to prepare the
baccalaureate-holder to do.

The Ph.D. degree is essentially a
research degree in most ﬁelds-
certainly in the sciences and most
social sciences. The best way for
someone to earn the degree of the
doctorate is to have some hands-on
experience, and to participate with
faculty members in alive, one-on-

teaching. A good reseacher—a
person who’s an outstanding
researcher and a mediocre teacher
—can get promoted. An outstand-
ing teacher (who is) a mediocre
researcher cannot.

You take that formula and extend
it over the 600 faculty members in
FAS. and, despite the fact there’s
good teaching in FAS, there’s a
very strong bias of the system
toward producing people who are
fine publishers and mediocre
teachers. If you’re a young faculty
member and you know that’s the
system by which you will be
evaluated, I don't think there’s
much question as to where you put
the focus of your energy and time.

One distinction that’s very
important to make is that I favor
the University’s vigorous pursuit of
its research mission. But what we
need is a much more sophisticated

“I think the University doesn’t value

teaching nearly so much as it does research.

I think that ’s demonstrable. ”

Dr. Robert Marshall

teaching and most of our initiatives
in recent times—most of our time,
most of our energy-—has to do with
either instructional program devel-
opment or improving teaching
directly.

I suspect the extent to which
Dean Marshall and I"disagree has
not to do with the importance of
teaching or that the importance of
teaching is critical, but has to do
with the role of teaching or
scholarship. The University of
Pittsburgh’s mission is more than
just a college. A college, such as
many of the private liberal arts
schools, essentially has only one
mission—a straight teaching mis-
sion for undergraduates.

I can totally sympathize with

Dean Marshall’s feelings that that
is the most critical. After all, he is
dean of the college and we should
always have a dean of the college

one situations. Therefore, simply
having the graduate-professional
mission as part of our mission, we
have to worry very much about that
instruction also. And there is about
one-third of our student body in
that category.

There’s also a third mission of
the university, and this really is not
shared with colleges. It’s the
research mission. The research
mission, for which we get about $30
million in Federally-sponsored
research and Federally-sponsored
programs, has to do with the whole
range of activity no other part of
society will take on as part of its
responsibility. It has to do with
developing polio vaccine and
injections to prevent gonorrhea. It
has to do with development of all
kinds of useful things for society.
It’s a mission we take very
seriously.There are only about 50 to
I00 major universities in the country
that have this type of mission. The
difﬁculty in reconciling the kinds of
talents needed to perform all three
missions is a subject of debate
among men of very respectable
opinion, and it’s a matter that
deserves a lot of discussion.

It is critical for all missions that

faculty demonstrate excellent un-
derstanding of their ﬁeld—-—ﬁrst of
all, they knowiwhat they’re talking
about. Even if they don’t express it
well, even if they aren’t as
impressive as we'd like them in a
classroom setting, at least they’re
knowledgeable about their ﬁeld,
they’re current with it, and show
the kind of scholarship that shows
they’re staying current.
Marshall: I think the University
doesn’t value teaching nearly so
much as it does research. I think
that's demonstrable. I would
welcome anyone’s looking at all the
dossiers of those under considera-
tion for promotion. Anyone can
study those dossiers and see very
clearly" what counted the most.

In evaluating a faculty member
as a researcher. as a publisher,
there’s an elaborate process that
takes a long period of time and
intense national effort. The
evaluation of teaching is a very
superﬁcial kind of thing. As far as
I’m concerned, it's‘ clear that
research counts far more than

system of “diversiﬁed staffing,”
whereby you make- a much more
decentralized deﬁnition of the
differing roles of the different
schools and departments and the
faculty within those departments.

It’s important for research to be
done in biological science. I don’t
recognize the need for 50 faculty
members in the English depart-
ment to be primarily concerned
with research and publication. We
need a much more diversiﬁed
system. Our system now says our
faculty should be outstanding in
both areas. As far as I’m
concerned, that’s like putting a lion
and a lamb in the same cage and
saying, “Deal with each other.”
It’s inevitable that one is going to
dominate the concern of the faculty
rather than the other.

One other important distinction:
I see a close and necessary
relationship between teaching and
scholarship. I don’t necessarily see
a relationship between teaching
and publication. That’s an awfully
important distinction. You can’t be
a good teacher unless you continue
throughout your life being a good
student. There’s all the difference
in the world between being
somebody who remains alive as a
scholar and someone who puts his‘
or her prime energy into converting
that scholarship into publication.

For instance, as an English
professor, I should be reading a lot
of anthropology, sociology and
psychology, and I should be
becoming more and more general
in my awareness. As soon as I
write for a national audience,
there’s an inevitable—especially if
you’re a faculty member—an
inevitable necessity to specialize.
That’s how you get yourself ahead
in the world of publication. You
narrow your area. you specialize.
To the extent I get buried in my
own specialization, I become less
and less prepared to teach
undergraduates.

Q. Is this in any sense a science vs.
humanities conﬂict?

Marshall: In one sense, I think so. I
think that one of the unfortunate
things that’s happened in liberal
arts education in the last 30 or 40
years is that the sciences have been

dominant in our culture and the
other disciplines are trying to act
_like the sciences. I think there’s

fthat sort of conﬂict. When I talk to

faculty members about the rela-
tionship between research and
teaching, I’m very aware of the fact
that there’s a much closer
relationship between what the
scientist is doing in the laboratory
and what everybody else is doing in
the classroom.

I’m not trying to raise the issue

of the two cultures, but I think
there are signiﬁcant differences
and I think the University is forcing
other disciplines to mimic the
sciences because the sciences give
such clear and” precise results. I
think that’s an important part of
the problem.
Powers; I think it’s an important
part of the problem, as the dean
says. I do think, however, we can
get- faculty who are fascinated by
both teaching and research. I think
there are plenty of faculty available
who are interested in coming to this
University and can demonstrate
skills in both. We have perhaps
one-half the teaching load of most
liberal arts colleges, which gives
faculty members in humanities and
in all other ﬁelds an opportunity to
spend time with students and be
superb teachers and still do
adequate research.

I think the purpose of publication
in non-scientiﬁc ﬁelds is reﬂected
in part in what the dean said about
drawing on other ﬁelds and getting
new insights into your own
discipline. Curiosity is a funda-
mental aspect of human nature. I
want faculty in this University to be
driven by that curiosity and to be
fascinated with the forefront of
their discipline. If they’re not
fascinated by it, if they don’t want

to reach out into other ﬁelds to see 

if they can’t broaden their
understanding, then I don’t think
they ought to be part of our faculty.

What I’d like them to do is take it
one step further——write down what
it is they’re ﬁnding out from
psychology, anthropology, sociol-
ogy, etc., and test it on their
colleagues in the ﬁeld. Take that
new idea, that new interpretation,
write it out exactly as they would
speak it to a class, put it in the
journals, and see how their peers in
the profession react to it. Perhaps
you’re going to do them a favor;
they can adopt your interpretation
and beneﬁt from the insight you’ve
gained. '

I think we don’t have to choose
between goodteachers and persons
who do research. I think we can
have both. Lighter teaching loads
at a big university like this gives us
time to do both.

On another part of it, we do
indeed have a diversiﬁed faculty.
FAS is rather complex because
they have an undergraduate
college, a huge graduate program
and a substantial research mission.

In the whole University we have 164’ "9
schools and four campuses, and Id

can’t pretend for a moment that the
interpretations of standards is
identical as to making promotion
and tenure decisions among all.

Because some are essentially
undergraduate colleges or cam-
puses, we do differentiate on
standards. We do not differentiate
on criteria. The criteria for tenure
should include scholarship and
solid teaching competence. The
reason we’ve taken all the steps in
the past couple of years for a
University-wide ofﬁce for evalua-

tion of teaching—making evalua-‘WV )

tory for at least one course a

year—is so we can get student

feedback. But that alone won’t
work. Another important part of
this is peer review. It won’t do just
to ask students if a teacher’s
presentation seemed good to them.
You also have to get his peers in his
department, persons current in the
ﬁeld, active researchers, to look at
his reading list, his course
syllabus, his test materials, to see
if the guy actually is delivering the
state of the art as far as that ﬁeld

goes.
Marshall: I think it’s interesting
Dr. Powers should have ‘talked

about the need for faculty to have a
sense of curiosity about the
frontiers of their ﬁeld. I'd be
prepared to say that in many
disciplines—but not all disciplin-
es——the kind of system we now
have actually has an anti-intellect-
ual effect.

Let me bring up the example of
interdisciplinary aspects of the
ﬁeld. In the late 1960's, things
were happening in the ﬁeld of
education all over. One of the
things that happened in graduate
education was a much greater
concern for interdisciplinary stud-

‘ , 1es.
U When I got my Ph.D. in 1964, I

u
s

came out as a narrow specialist in
medieval literature. Colleagues
who joined my department in 1969,
1970, 1971—they had been taking
graduate programs that had
introduced them to the relation-
ships between literature, psychol-
ogy, sociology, natural sciences,
etc. They had been broadened and
then they came face to’ face with a
system that says deliver in four or
ﬁve years. It said deliver fast.
Graduate students who became
faculty members and spent the
mid-1970’s trying to develop a

, breadth of interest-which is far

more complicated intellectually
than the narrow kind of training I
had—these faculty members have
found ‘themselves being denied
tenure in the last few years because

they hadn’t moved quickly enough. '

Under this current system, you
have to narrow and specialize and
focus much more quickly.

Dr. Powers was stressing, in a
sense, the ease of the transition

from thinking to writing. It doesn’t

work that way in reality. In reality,
with the exception of some faculty
and some disciplines, it is truly a
discontinuous activity between
research and teaching. You have to
‘make a real-life decision where
‘ou’re going to put you energies
and focus.

Q. The possibility of tightening up
requirements—putting more
structure into the curriculum—has
been mentioned by the administra-
tion. Is this going to happen, and is
it a good idea?
Marshall: I think it’s going to
happen, and I think it’s a bad idea.
I’m so tired of hearing about the
experiments of the 1960's that have
failed—the experiments of the
'1960’s were never tried. What
happened was that faculties took
away the traditional structure and
didn’t put anything in its place.
We were trying to take away the
artiﬁcial structures that existed and
replace them with structures that
would have more freedom in them,
more choice in them, a more
dynamic quality to them. But our
assumption always was that faculty
were going to change their
behavior, that a spirit of universi-
ties as true centers of learning
would be developed in such a
_ dynamic way that we wouldn’t

‘x heed the crutches of requirements

in order to make it clear to students
what makes an educated person.

I still think of requirements as
crutches. Just think of the writing

requirement—which, by the way,
is an extraordinarily false issue. I
keep producing facts and ﬁgures
that show virtually all students take
writing without it being a require-
ment—that more students take
composition now than when it was

a requirement. But it falls on deaf
ears. The people I’m talking to are
saying that, in educational terms,
they think something is far better
done when somebody is forced ‘to
do it than when they choose to do
it, which has some very interesting
implications.

But let me focus on the writing
requirement. Think of what the
system is saying when it says
18-year-olds are required to take a
composition course; young adults
who are in college and are
pursuing higher education, that
they ought to be told to take a
writing course:

The system should be so
dynamic that the entire system is
saying to students you can’t get
through this system unless you’re a
good writer. The faculty should be
so concerned with the total
education of all students that it
should become eminently clear to a
student that he or she can’t begin
to deal with this school without
being a good writer. Make that a
requirement and there’ll be a sense
of ease and relaxation on the part of
the faculty.

‘ I think the same could be said of

trying to introduce core require-
ments. If we can’ t make it clear to
students for four «years that they
should be taking courses here and
there for their own good, then the
whole system is failing.
Powers: There. are four or ﬁve
standard models of a liberal
education, and I don’t think it’s the
end of the world to elect one of
them instead of the other. Some are
very prescriptive, with lots of core
courses and requirements. Others
are more of a cafeteria system,
allowing tremendous freedom of
choice.

I don’t think you have to have a
lot of requirements._ I think
whatever action we take ought to
preserve and protect the best of

requirements, without prescrip-
tive, minimum core material being
covered. I think FAS is going to
have to enter into a major debate
on what goals it holds for its
students. I hope they do not
diminish the things from the 1960’s
that were good.

I do want them, however, to

develop a coherent philosophy of
what they’re trying to accomplish,
identify with some speciﬁcity the
levels of accomplishment they want
from their students, and get on
with a curriculum that is consistent
with that philosophy.
Q. Some professors have said
privately that some departments
are suffering because other depart-
ments are receiving more attention
and more money, and that this is
"being done for the sake of
University prestige. Is this true?

' Powers: I don’t think you can easily

generalize about the differences in
quality among the 30 departments
in FAS. There are national rating
systems—essentially opinion polls
taken of professors of other
institutions. In such polls you ﬁnd
very great endorsement of the
quality of the work in the
departments of philosophy’,
chemistry, physics and others. This
does not mean the other depart-
ments are inadequate in terms of
quality. It means they don’t yet
have the national recognition to be
rated high.

Marshall: You’re assuming that
quality is determined in terms of
research, in terms of national
ranking, national standing. I think
that's very revealing.

One of the factors that hasn’t
been talked about is faculty course
load, and whether or not some
departments are favored in that
regard. In some departments a
faculty member teaches six courses
a year. In some departments it’s
four a year. That’s 50 percent
more, and yet we don’t talk about
the difference——whether the de-

departments and the effects of that
discrimination, you have to look at
things like teaching load, etc.

Powers: I don’t think anyone is
keeping the numbers quiet. In
terms of teaching load, the
humanities is averaging exactly
ﬁve courses per two terms. In
liberal arts colleges it is typically
four or five courses per term-—-not
ﬁve courses per two terms. The
humanities have ample opportunity
to do the kinds of research and
scholarship we were speaking of
earlier.

In the social sciences, the
average is about 4.3 courses per
two terms, not that different from
the humanities. The natural
sciences are only about 60

(,_-rym.

“The administration is strongly supportive

of excellence in teaching. We’re also worried

about other major missions. ”

Dr. David Powers

what our curriculum allows. I think
that whatever the FAS choose as
the curriculum for the CAS, it
ought to have a pretty solid
philosophical base, and it ought to
articulate very clearly a number of
goals. I want those goals to include
skills such as writing and commu-
nicating because I believe persons
cannot be successful in profession-
al or personal lives without that. I
want to give them the kind of basic
literacy in the sciences and
mathematics—and the advanced
literacy, as far as I'm concerned, in
writing and communications—that
will enable them to do what they
want later. I want one that excites
students, interests them and serves
their needs.

I think a lot of the standard
models could work at Pitt. A lot of
the objectives could be met without

One of the things I find
distressing is the way we keep
under cover the facts and ﬁgures
that really point out the difference
in faculty lives. I sit in on tenure
review committees where the
committees are looking primarily at
the research production of the
faculty member and secondarily at
the teaching. What isn’t taken into
consideration is that this faculty
member teaches six courses a year
and this one teaches four; that this
one teaches four different courses
among those six, while this one
teaches two among those four; that
in ﬁve years this one has taught 13
different courses and this one has
taught four different courses; that
this faculty member regularly has
172 students and this faculty
member has 37 students in a year.

If you’re going to talk about the
question of discrimination among

percent-—a little over three courses
per two terms—and the reason is
that those natural scientists are
bringing in $8 million per annum,
writing off a large part of their
salaries on research grants.

The actual cost per credit hour is
not the most expensive in the
natural sciences. The highest cost
per credit hour is often in the social
sciences. I think that it’s ' very
misleading to suggest that the
difference in teaching load can
account for differences in scholarly
output.

I think another way to view the
quality of the department is what
the students think. National studies
have indicated that student rank-
ings of faculty by department are
not correlated with whether or not
they have research grants. Ironi-
cally, the departments that have

rated" high in our undergraduate
surveys are the departments that
have lots of research grants and are
very active in publishing and
research. ‘

Marshall: Dr. Powers was down-
playing the difference in course
load, but I suggest that if you go to
a faculty member who's teaching
six courses in a department where

_the normal load is six courses a

year, and compare that with a
faculty member whose normal load
is four courses a year, you'll ﬁnd a
big difference in those” faculty
members’ lives. That’s 50 percent
more teaching, 50 percent more
preparation, students, grades and
papers to read. If anybody thinks
that doesn’t make a signiﬁcant
difference in those two faculty
members’ ability to focus, to
produce publications, then  be
verjfsurprisédfi “W M F '

Q. Is there anything either one of
you would like to add to this
discussion?

Powers: It’s unfortunate that some
newspapers have represented this
as a debate over the importance of
teaching. Most of the things we’ve
been doing the last few years, most
of matters we give attention to, are

instructional programs for teaching '

itself. The debate shouldn’t be
represented as who cares the most
about teaching. We all care about it
a great deal. I think the issue is
rather the proper role of scholar-
ship in making decisions about
promotion and tenure.

Marshall: I think actually the
debate is about teaching and the
concern for teaching. You've got to
remember, as I said before, when I
say teaching I mean a variety of
things—quality, distribution» of
resources, the concern in general
for undergraduate as opposed to
graduate and research programs.
This is exactly what the debate is
all about. It’s between a focus on
undergraduate education and the
concerns of undergraduate educa-
tion as opposed to the University’s
primary concern with its own image
and reputation. I think it comes
down to a struggle between the
institution as a whole ‘and the
individual—-—the concern for the
individual students who are part of
this institution.

Energy Week

Energy is on a lot of people’s minds this week. The coal strike
lingers on—inasmuch as anything involving the volatile
mineworkers’ union can be said to “linger”—and the possibility of
utility cutbacks is moving closer to becoming an actuality.

Joseph Dutton, Pitt’s vice chancellor for business and finance,
announced reductions in University energy usage Friday. Heat and
ventilation systems are to be turned down, non-essential lighting
and conveniences, like escalators in buildings that also have

elevators, are to be turned off.

Such measures are welcomed by anyone interested in energy con-
servation; in fact, one wonders why it takes a crisis to force what
would be reasonable procedure in any case. But decisions of this
sort are not a simple matter. The whole energy issue-area is a web
of complexities, one in which informed decisions require an ex-
traordinarily thorough knowledge of the subject.

The decision whether to cut back on power use, for instance, is
politically complex on many levels. Is turning down the heat tan-
tamount to siding with the coal operators against the union? Will
cutbacks result in unemployment here or elsewhere, and if so, are

-they worth it? If we turn down the heat, can we really afford to

turn it back up again when the crisis is over?

The need for answers to these and other questions leads us to
support the goals outlined. for Energy Week at Pitt, which runs
today through Friday. Initiated by Project Pacesetter’s Task Force
on Education, the effort this week is to be directed toward seeking
the involvement of the University community in addressing energy

issues.

-While we hardly expect all Pitt professors to comply with
Provost Smith’s request that they devote a class period this week to
discussion of energy conservation, it is possible that some new
awareness might come out of these five days. The library displays
are not likely to compel anyone to make a radical change of
lifestyle, but the general illumination induced by something like
Energy Week certainly can’t hurt as long as it doesn’t lead to com-

placency.

Project Pacesetter—and energy conservation in general—has
been largely ignored in Allegheny County and everywhere else. It
would be nice to see the University take the educational lead in this
area, thereby helping citizens to find answers to the tough energy
questions. Energy Week might be a first, small step toward doing

this.

Letters to the Editor

More About The ‘One-Sided Presentation’  

The recent essay by Julie
Graham on the conﬂict in the
Middle East cries out for a reply. I
have never seen such a one-sided
presentation by someone who was
not an openly declared partisan of
one side or the other. Is the reader
to assume that Graham reached her
conclusions based on an open-
minded evaluation of the facts?
That she did not is evident from the
contortions she went through to
explain the term “rejectionist” as
it is used to identify certain Arab
states and groups. Contrary to
Graham's explanation, they have
been labelled rejectionists because
they reject Israel’s right to exist,

and they reject the notion that
peace can be obtained by negoti-
ation with Israel. It is meaningless
to say, as she does, that
“_Everybody wants peace in the
Mid-East,” without reference to
the terms under which peace is
desired. I agree that the rejection-
ist front probably wants peace, but
a peace that does not include a
state of Israel or probably, many
Jews living there.

For the rest, I would simply pose
several questions. When did the
Palestinian people acquire this
right of self-determination? Only
after June 1967? For 19 years
before that time, the West Bank and

The Political Basis for Pitt’s Impending Tuition Hike

During the past few months, the
students, faculty and administra-
tion of the University of Pittsburgh
found themselves placed in the
uncomfortable situation of not
being certain as to the amount, not
time of arrival for, the overwhel-
ming majority of the University’s
external source of funding; that
which is obtained from”“ the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

During this period, the admini-
stration of the University courted,

received and welcomed participa-
tion of the student body in the
lobbying efforts to sway passage of
the legislation necessary to achieve
this funding. This was, as we are
all aware, eventually to come
about, but not without some
serious disappointments‘.-

As it turns out, due to the cut in
the amount of the appropriation
from that which was anticipated in
planning the budget, and from the
money lost in terms of interest paid

on money that was necessarily
borrowed, the University stood the
chance of running a budget deﬁcit
of $2.8 million.

Through internal re-allocations
of existing funds, the administra-
tion has for the most part dealt
well with this situation and should
be applauded. It appears as if this
deﬁcit has been reduced to that of
only about $400,000, which is truly
minor when one considers it in
terms of the size of the University
budget approzimately $200 million
for ﬁscal year 1977.

It is here that the applause must
end. For in a sense, the
cooperation between the admini-
stration and the student body
comes to an end on this matter.

The administration has decided
to submit to the Board of Trustees,
at their Feb. 14 meeting, a request
for a tuition increase of 6.5 percent,
effective spring term. This latest in
the series of tuition increases,
which have plagued Pitt students
over the past few years, seems to
be the result of considerable
calculation of concerns more
political than economic in nature.

For starters, the deﬁcit ﬁgure of
$400,000 seems to be quite
conviently linked to a percentage
tuition increase almost identical in
magnitude to those of the previous
few years. Does the administration
feel that students have become
tolerant" to tuition increases of this
size?

Six hundred thousand dollars of
the deficit was satisfied by
re-allocation of part of the $1.4
million repair and renovation
budget, an area of considerable
ﬂexibility in budgetary planning.
Why couldn't the additional
$400,000 be made up similarly?

It would seem that to stave off

any increase until fall would not

only be fairer to the entire student

body, as it would distribute the
University’s financial problems
over the entire student population
but would also allow for better
planning on the part of students
struggling to meet their education-
al expenses. Or, better yet, with a
little imagination the University
might try looking to sources of
funds other than the already-over-
burdened student’s pocketbook.

It seems to me that a spring
tuition increase probably has, in
reality, a basis other than the
economic one being presented to us
by the administration; that being a
political one. A fall tuition increase
would nottouch the legislators as
quickly as a spring increase, and,
subsequently, it would not be
considered of any importance when
they consider the ﬁscal year 1979
budget in July. Legislators who are
getting complaints about the rising
cost of education may be more
easily swayed to the cause of
greater expenditure for the Univer-
sity.

Besides, it only makes sense to
raise tuition for spring; Penn State
and Temple did, so why should Pitt
be any different?

I personally feel that it’s about
time the administration of the
University of Pittsburgh placed the
concerns of the student population
as paramount in importance and
not reduce the students to the role
of political poker chips on the
blackjack table of Harrisburg.
Maybe we could save money by
changing little things, like the free
football tickets we give to our
friends in Harrisburg who claim to
love us so much.

the Gaza Strip were governed by
Arab states. Why did they not
respond in an appropriate way to
this
Palestinian people?” It is, perhaps,
because they don't really believe it
themselves but are willing to use it
as long as it serves as a handy
weapon against Israel?

As for Zionism as an aggressive

,force—where were you, Julie

Graham, in 1948 when the Arab
states invaded Israel on the day it
came into existence because they
rejected its right to do so? Or, in
1956, when Israel returned the
entire Sinai to Egypt in exchange
for a promise of free passage
through the Suez Canal and the

“legitimate right of the‘

presence of a United Nations force, .,

to deter terrorist attacks against it
originating in the Sinai. Was this
withdrawal an example of Zionist
aggression and a “foreign policy of
expansionism?” Where were you
in 1967 when Egypt, without
provocation, ordered the U.N.
buffer to withdraw and blockaded
Israel’s sole seaport to the Indian
Ocean?

In addition to the obvious
extreme partisanship, I found
equally disturbing the apparently
mindless acceptance of slogans and
the repetitions of meaningless
cliches. Does Graham know any-
thing about the history of that

area? Why does she hope. that‘
Sadat will rejoin the Arab nationsﬁ

and why does she place such a high
value on Arab unity? There hasn’t
been unity of the countries in that
area in the some 1300 years since
Mohammad, except for the time
when they were all controlled by a
single ruler. Why should the
second half of the 20th century be
an exception? Why is maintenance
of Arab unity in rejecting peaceful
negotiations a higher value than
pursuing peace at the negotiating

table?

all Pitt professors to devote one
class period to some aspect of
energy conservation related to their
discipline.

Quatroche stressed that Project
Pacesetter is ‘ ‘strictly voluntary and
non-structured. The task forces
can’t mandate or dictate.”

“With the energy crisis caused
by the coal shortage, fate is playing

‘, into ourhands. Here we haveareal
I illustration of the energy crisis,”
Quatroche said.

“It seems we are being
oversaturated with information
about energy problems,” he
continued. “The most difficult
thing is that people say ‘all they do
is study.”’p

“But it’s a different ballgame in
energy. I think all of this is an
important repetitive process that
can only further create conscious-
ness of the problems we face.”

Participants in the program,
Quatroche said, believe they will
succeed in showing that voluntary
efforts to confront energy problems

. 7 can work and those efforts will be
followed by other cities.

Two professors have been given a

Teller Turns Fakir, ‘Fortune’ Rings

By MARY s. HUZINEC

Pitt News Staff Writer

Have you ever wondered about
your future?

I’ve always had an intense
curiosity about who I’ll marry, what
he’ll look like, how I’ll meet him,
how I'll know he’s “the one,” how
many kids we’ll have and if we’ll
live long lives. Above all, I’ve
wondered if I’ll be happy.

Last week. I visited a fortune
teller.

When I made the appointment by
phone, “Sister Rose” asked me if I
wanted the $5 or the $10 reading.

“What’s the difference?” I
asked.

“A $5 reading covers half your
life, and a $10 reading reveals your
whole life,” she replied in broken
English.

Itold her I’dtake the $10 reading.

As I walked to my appointment
the next day, I wondered if the
experience would be frightening.
What if she lead me into a dark,
spiderweb-ﬁlled corridor? Or is she
told me I was going to be killed in a
freak accident the next day?

My fears were subdued when I
saw a “walk in” sign on the door of
a harmless-looking red brick house.

When I stepped into the living
room, I found an Italian family

watching “The Price Is Right.” I
thought I had entered the wrong
place until a young woman jumped
from the couch and escorted me into
a small room. Religious pictures
and statues of Christ sat on a table
beside my chair. Where were the
spider webs, the crystal balls?

“I’m Rita,” the woman said in a
soft voice. “Would you like the $5 or
$10 reading?”

I wanted to ask her if she was at
least going to light some candles
and ask her family to turn off the
television. Bob Barker was speak-
ing loudly enough to be heard
across the street.

“What would you like to know?”
she said. Her big brown eyes gave
me the creeps.

“I’d like to find out what kind of
life I’ll have. Tell me about my
career and love life.”

“You’re going to be very happy, ’ ’
she said conﬁdently. “And suc-
cessful. You’ll get what you want.
want.

“Presently, someone loves you
very much, but is afraid to show it,”
she continued. “You’ll marry when
you’re 25, have three children and
live to a ripe old age.”

“Get some toilet paperl” some-
one yelled from the living room. I
forced myself not to laugh.

The door was ﬂung open, and

Sister Rose entered the room. “It's
about time you got here,” I wanted
to say. +
“How are you, honey?” Sister
Rose asked. Before giving me a
chance to reply, she said, “You’re
gonna be very happy, there’s no
doubt about it. You’ll get what you
want . So you like the reading Rita is
giving you?”

Instead of telling her what a joke I
thought the whole thing was, I
replied, “You told me exactly what
Rita did,”

“Good-bye, honey,” Sister Rose
said as she walked out the door.

“How do you read people?”I
asked Rita.

“It’s a gift from God,” she said.
“Our entire family has it. Will you
donate some money so I can pray for
you in church?”

“No, that’s all right,” I replied,
wanting to get out of the place as
quickly as possible.

As I walked out the door, Sister
Rose yelled, “Remember, honey,
you’re gonna be happy!”

“They’re probably laughing
about how gullible I am” I
thought as I walked back to campus.

“We’l1 see who gets the last
laugh.” .
A few seconds later, I stepped on

a patch of ice, and fell so hard I
thought I broke something.

Fantasies Flower In Valentine’s Day Wishes

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
In spring, a young man’s fancy

turns to love. But since
Punxatawney Phil has pushed that
option off into April, Valentine’s
Day seems a particularly welcome
respite from a cold winter.

Pitt students might not qualify as
full-time romantics, but everyone
schemes and dreams on
Valentine’s Day. While many men
might dream along with the junior
who claimed his perfect Valentine’s

Day would start by waking up next
to Farrah Fawcett-Majors, most
students had somewhat more
sedate and traditional plans for
Hallmark’s greatest card-selling
day.

“What I’d like best on Valen-
tine's Day is to come_ home from
classes and ﬁnd a dozen red roses
on my desk,” said a freshman
woman.

The 20 women questioned
showed far greater variety in their

opinions than the 20 men polled.
One woman suggested a midnight
trip to the incline; another thought
it would be fun to treat her
boyfriend to dinner and a movie,
and still another had a secret desire
to be surprised with a huge box of
heart-shaped candy.

“I’d spend the evening alone
with my boyfriend,” said a junior.
“I’d cook dinner for him with
candlelight, and we’d stay in.”

Another junior claimed nothing
could top Valentine’s Day two

years ago, when her boyfriend
recited an e. e. cummings poem
special to their ‘relationship—
except, perhaps, a repeat.

Men’s replies were more
uniform and more extravagant.

Eight men felt the perfect
Valentine’s Day would be celebrat-
ed by seeing a performance at
Heinz Hall, followed by dinner at a
good restaurant. One man stressed

that the cheeseboard at the Cafe
Cappuccino would make the

evening especially memorable.

Pitt News Staff Writer

So you want to go all out this
Valentine’s Day—beyond the trad-
itional ﬂowers (roses are going for
$30 a dozen at most places anyway)
and candy (which is usually
old—too bad you can’t eat the fancy
box, because it’s a lot more
appetizing than the botched-looking
chocolate).

You're in for more variety than
you might imagine.

Cards are a tradition, and you can
purchase a mammoth greeting
that’s a full yard long in most card
stores. You can buy inﬂatable
hearts, presumably for summer
pool use, or heart-shaped plastic
boxes to stash paper clips in.

Those with a sweet tooth can ﬁnd
giant Hershey kisses, billed as the
world’s largest kisses, or heart-

shaped lollipops and petit fours.

The stuffed animal addict can add
a huge, fuzzy, stuffed heart to his
collection, or a pair of hugging
mice, monkeys or bears. These
animals started as promo . for
Close-up toothpaste, but have since
graduated to the mass market.
I'here’s usual overflow of teddy
bears, dyed red and white, and a
whole zoo-full of creatures bearing
hearts around their necks in honor
of the big day.

Men can buy their girlfriends
heart-shaped barrettes in red or
tortoiseshell, necklaces with a solid
heart or the outline of one, or
night-gowns in a variety of red,

white and pink print patterns. A,

famous cosmetics company is
selling its product in a huge red
ceramic heart.

Women can treat their boyfriends
to shorts embellished with row upon
row of passionately red hearts.

Other men opted for a quiet
evening at home (“That’s the
whole point, being together with no
one else around,” said one
sophomore), or for a quiet walk
with their girlfriends.

A junior wanted to receive a long
love letter from the object of his
affection, a senior said though he
was sending roses to his girl, it
would mean a lot to him if she
reciprocated, and a freshman
simply wanted to receive a
va1entine—“Any kind of valentine,
from anyone.”

A signiﬁcant number of those
polled said they would prefer to
spend the day in bed. Although
most people wanted to do
traditional things together, a few
came up with some rather startling
ideas for a fun Valentine’s
Day——like the sophomore who
wanted to mail himself to his
girlfriend.

“You couldn’t top that,” he

mused. “But I don’t trust campus W

mail, so I guess that’s out.”

Valentines: Love For Sale

There are cupid dolls and cookie
cutters, stationery and T-shirts, all
advertising Valentine’s Day.
Cosmopolitan Magazine advises
“seductive little dinner for two,”
and Woman’s Day passes on cookie
recipes; melted-down hardtack
creates stained-glass hearts in the
middle of the dough.

There are valentine-printed
sheets beneath valentine-printed
bedspreads, with red velvet heart-
shaped pillows and a heart-shaped
candle you can light to insure a
romantic eventing.

Which makes it pretty hard to
believe that this custom started

centuries ago in a French prison,’

where a simple monk named
Valentine sent notes of encourage-
ment to fellow inmates so they
might retain love, in spite of the way
they were treated.

Randy Newman

 Weirdo Boyfrien

ByMARTHAGARVEY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Six months ago, Randy Newman
couldn’t sing his song, “Lonely at
the Top,” without giggling. The
song is a lament about the price of
fame. The man in the song makes it
big and discovers the world has no
meaning.

After six albums and no fame, I
had retired Newman to my list of
favorite unknowns. Then the radio
stations started playing “Short
People.” Now Newman isn’t
laughing anymore.

After years of obscurity, having
Newman make it big is like having
my parents ﬁnd out about my
weirdo boyfriend—and approve of
him.

Newman was one of my idols in
high schools. James Taylor was the

much more appeal for me. He was
the weird teenager’s answer to
Simon and Garfunkel. What did I
care about parsley and sage and
true love of mine? What true love of
mine?

One afternoon, as I was remember them from high school— much anymore, and rings with No’ I donu‘ know anyone who with giﬁke angb°1:al_yairdfWrapped

wearing those high school rings
with the angora wrapped around
them, I heard a nasal whine on my
radio. I ﬁxed the station, but the
whine persisted. It was Newman.
Was he singing about true love?
Was he singing about breaking up?
(Who did I have to break up with?)
No. He was singing “Political
Science,” his answer to inter-
national strife: “Let’s drop the big
one. There’ll be no one left to blame
us.”

I never heard the song again, but
that’s when my clandestine affair
began. I searched the record stores
until I found the album. “Sail
Away.” The title song is a cheerful
little commerical for slavery, as a
slave-ship captain might have sung
it. And “Political Science,” while
recommending blowing up most of

Newman’s world exposes un-
pleasant parts of both our personal
and public history. When I was in
high school, I was one of the very
few who went to peace marches and
who talked about politics. You

conscience, the ones who told you
not to put lettuce in your sandwich
because there was a strike on in
California? You always invited

them to your graduation party, and .3

then they would lecture you on the
fall of capitalism.

Randy Newman’s last album is
called, “Good Old Boys.” It’s
about the South, about rednecks
and about—blast from the past-
racism. Ah, -racism. Wasn’t‘ that
something Time Magazine used to
write about a lot when they weren’t
covering this week’s superstar?
Didn’t we ﬁx that in the 1960’s?

One of Newman’s rednecks
sings: “Now your Northern
Nigger’s a Negro/You see he's got
his dignity/Down here we’re too
ignorant to realize/ That the North

average obnoxious know-it-all, is
funny and subtle. He’s said that he
doesn’t hate short people, that the

“Saturday Night Fever” isthat the
Bee Gees (Barry, Robin and
Maurice Gibb) composed the entire
score in less than three weeks.

Producer Robert Stigwood’s
selection of the Bee Gees to write
and perform the music for his
movie on the disco life in New York
was well-based—the Australian
trio had a string of disco hits from
“Jive Talkin’ ” to “Nights on
Broadway” and are very adept with
the form.

The Bee Gees started out in the

   

 mid 1960’s with soft ballads like

“How Can You Mend a Broken

. Heart” and “Massachusetts.” The

Gibbs’ high voices, teamed with
poetic lyrics and a preference for
elaborate arrangements, brought a

Night Fever,” coincidently, is the
top-selling album) is one of the
most simplistic pieces the Bee Gees

 
 
 



have ever recorded, and, in its,

simplicity, one of their best.

“How Deep Is Your Love?” is a
delicate song, reminiscent of “To
Love Somebody” with strong
vocals by Barry Gibb and intricate
musicianship. The echoing refrain
by Robin and Maurice, an old Bee
Gees trademark, gives “How Deep
Is Your Love?” a soft, finished
quality.

“Emotions" is not so ethereal as
“How Deep Is Your Love?,” but it
is performed in much the same
manner. The poetry here is

and speed.

The Diodes have deﬁnite roots in
pop grounds of the 1960’s, but

Tom Sherwin took his annual role
of designated hero yesterday and
led the Pitt Hockey Club to a 6-3
victory over Dayton in the title
game of Pitt’s Invitational Candle
Light Tournament at the Lake Vue
Arena.

For the second straight year,
Sherwin provided the Panthers
with a last-minute shorthanded
goal to settle the outcome.
Although last year’s breakaway
-effort against Ohio University with
1:21 left handed Pitt a more
dramatic 3-2 win, Sherwin’s
dismantling of Dayton was no less
effective.

The scrappy center’s open-net
shot from the Dayton blue line with
44 seconds remaining erased a
‘Flyer powerplay and gave Pitt its
third Invitational championship in
four attempts.

Sherwin, who collected two goals
and three assists in the tournament
to skate off with Most Valuable

‘ powerplay

- ‘A

Player honors, wasn’t the only
Panther hero. Goalie Tom Slivka
stood like a stone wall in the Pitt
cage, turning away 23 Flyer shots
and was the difference between
victory and defeat.

Slivka’s stellar performance
picked up where Larry Newell left
off the day before. In the Panthers’
opening-round 7-4 victory over
Navy, Newell stopped 26 shots.

“Tom Slivka played well,” said
interim coach Bob Klemz after the
game. “At the beginning of the
year, he was a little shaky, but he’s
been playing good goal of late. It’s
nice to know that we have two
reliable goalies now.” -

Pitt and Dayton played closely in
the ﬁrst period, and it took a

Gymnasts Sentenced

By Poor Judging    

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s men and women gymnasts
were defeated this weekend at
Kent State in a triangular meet with
Kent State and Eastern Michigan,
but it was not due to a lack of skill,
talent or practice.

According to coaches Frank
D’Amico and Donna DeMarino, a
combination of incompetent judg-
ing, hazardous gym conditions and

9' some chaotic meet organization

caused one of the longest,
frustrating afternoons either coach
had ever experienced.

The Pantherettes managed a
second place ﬁnish in the ﬁeld of
three with a score of 132. Kent State
took first place honors, scoring
137.24, leaving third place to
Eastern Michigan, with its score of
121.24.

Freshman Myra Bachuchin plac-
ed first in the all-around competi-
tion while teammate Allison
Hoburg chalked up a second place
ﬁnish. Bonnie Tressler took second
on the uneven bars despite
Sustaining a twisted ankle.

“I have never, either as a
competitor or a coach, seen a fairly
judged meet at Kent,” said
DeMarino. “It was something that
we expected, but it was still
frustrating. ’ ’

“The confusion was unbeliev-
able, ’ ’ DeMarino continued. ‘ ‘They
had three women’s events and two
men’s events occurring at the same
time. In addition to this, the
lighting was poor and there wasn’t

V-?§l.1fﬁcient matting.”

DeMarino also said Kent State is
not in the same region as Pitt and
therefore is not forced to guidelines
concerning safety and judging.

“Gymnastics isn’t like basketball
where the ball is either through the
hoop or not, or tennis where the ball
can be out of bounds or in,” said
DeMarino. “In gymnastics the
judges give the entire score, and, in
this case, there was just too much
difference between what score I
gave them and what they actually
received.”

DeMarino said that she judged
her team’s score to be around 135.
‘ ‘There really isn’t much we can do.
We can write letters and complain,
but it is something that has existed
for years.” DeMarino said.

Men’s coach Frank D’Amico was
disappointed and infuriated about

, the judges chosen by the Kent

coaches. He also said judging was a
key factor in the Panther’s second
place score of 166.65. Eastern
Michigan ﬁnished first with a score
of 179.6 and Kent State came in
third with 157.35.

Freshman Allan Myers ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the all-around with a score of
49.95, while teammate Doug Smith
turned in a score of 40.05, good
enough for fourth place.

Junior side horse specialist Mitch
Spero, captured third place in his
event with a score of 6.25. D’Amico
said Spero’s score, under normal
conditions could have gone as high
as 7.8 or 8.0.

‘ ‘It was during the high bar event
that I, experienced one of the
proudest moments in my coaching
career,” D’Amico said. “We knew
that we had to beat those judges and

Panthers to score the ﬁrst and only
goal before intermission. With the
Panthers playing four on three,
defenseman Al Zangrilli whistled a
shot from the point that bounced
off Dayton goalie Dave Spotts’
shoulder and landed past the goal
line. The score was Zangrilli’s ﬁrst
of the season.

The second period was as wide
open as the ﬁrst period was close.
Pitt jumped on Dayton for two
quick tallies and seemed to be
cruising at 3-0. The Flyers came
right back, however, when Rick
Tweedle slid a pass to the right of
Slivka, where Doug Overby stood
unattended to slide the puck under
the pads of the helpless Pitt
netminder.

It was Pitt’s turn for a nifty pass

we did it, with Myers, Keith
Wipprecht and Smith finishing one,
two and three.”

Two Pitt starters were forced to
drop out of the competition midway
through the meet because of the
ﬂu. Several other Panthers had
fallen victim to the ﬂu earlier in the
week.

‘ ‘This really crushed us, ’ ’
D’Amico said. “We take the best
four scores out of six performances
for each event. With two people out
these events, we were forced to take
our total scores from only those four
people. This decreased our chance

play late in the second period,
when Curt Hetz shruggedoff two
Dayton defenders and took off
down the left wing. Hetz’s pass hit
a streaking Gary Fries, who merely
had to tip the puck over the beaten
Spotts.

Dayton added its second goal
minutes later on the powerplay to
end the scoring for the period with
Pitt up 4-2.

Though Pitt collected nine.

penalties to Dayton’s three, the
Flyers could manage only one
powerplay goal. Slivka, with help
from the penalty-killing crew of
Hetz, Sherwin and the Stein
brothers (Rick and Bob) turned
away countless Flyer attempts,
even on the three occasions the
Panthers were two men short.
Dayton ﬁnally capitalized on
Pitt’s second two-man disadvan-
tage early in the third period. The
Panthers had successfully killed off
the penalty, but couldn't clear the
puck out of their zone. As as result,

of getting a better score on several
events.”

D’Amico echoes DeMarino’s
sentiments that the gym conditions
and meet organization were poor.

“The gym looked like something
on the order of a rundown high
school gym, but our biggest
problem came toward the end of the
ﬂoor exercise when the officials
wanted our guys (who had just
ﬁnished on the ﬂoor) to go directly
to the next event without a break.”
said D’Amico. “They were just
totally exhausted.”

U Tankers Dunk Weekend Foes, Up Record to 8-0

By ANGELA VAVITHES

The Pitt men’s swimming team
boosted its record to 8-0 over the
weekend, beating Clarion State
72-41, Friday and Cleveland State,
77-34, Saturday. *

There were mixed feelings about

méhe meets as many of the Pitt

/wimmers, as well’ as Coach Dick
Bradshaw, believed the teams were
too easy for the Panthers to beat.

“These meets are a waste of
time,” said freestyler Bob Green-

weld. “We would be better off
practicing. ’ ’

“It’s hard to get enough
motivation for good times with
these kinds of meets,” Bradshaw
said. “We need some challenge at
the end of the season, although it
does allow the swimmers a rest
before championships. ”

Others, like J eff Trew, believe ‘ ‘it
was lots of fun because everybody
got to swim different events.”

There were good performances in

freestyle against Clarion,

both meets by swimmers who had
not done much competing through-
out the season. In the 1000-yard
Tom
McGinley and Mike Reinhard
ﬁnished second and third respect-
ively, the 200-yard butterﬂy saw
Chris Butts take ﬁrst place, and
Neal Wallace followed suit in the
200-yard backstroke.

Orlando Catinchi and Mike
Connor took the number one and

‘two spots in the 200-yard breastroke

against both Clarion and Cleveland,

while the divers tookgﬁrst. second
and third in the one-meter against
Cleveland. The order of ﬁnish was
Scott Winkler, Pat Greenweld and
Bob Lambert, who competed for the
ﬁrst time this season. The results
wre similar in the three-meter,
which had Winkler, Greenweld and
Chris Mano taking top honors.

The last meet of the season will be
against Youngstown State. This
meet will determine whether Pitt
will have its ﬁrst undefeated
swimming team in 30 years.

into the net nine seconds after the
double minor expired and Dayton
was moving, but still down,‘ 4-3.

Less than a minute after the
Flyers madeit close, Bill Gedeon
ﬁred arink-wide pass to Tim Duffy
on the right wing and Duffy wasted
little time putting the Panthers
back up, 5-3.

Pitt controlled the ﬁnal half of
the third period, despite having to
kill consecutive penalties to end the
game, which set up Sherwin’s
heroics.

PANTHER PUCKS: Pitt raised
its record IO 11-7. . .Dayton defeated
Delaware, 5-4, in a dispute-
shortened opening-round game
Saturday. Only the ﬁrst two periods
of that game had been played when
the Lake Vue management
announced an unexpected curfew
that would have hurried the playing

of the third period. An ensueing .

discussion resulted in Delaware
going home, which left the
tournament without a consolation
game yesterday.

J_‘-C-3.‘: 

meet, Kent State has officially been
dropped from both team’s future
schedules.

“Oh, no,” said D’Amico “we
won’t be back at Kent. I refuse to
put our guys through that again.”

D’Amico must now rally his team
for its upcoming meet against Navy.

“All that I can say is that Navy
does have good facilities, and they
will be ready for us, especially after
we beat them last year by one tenth
of a point,” D’Amico said.

' DeMarino believs the Kent meet
will not affect her 16th-ranked
gymnasts in the slightest.

“We’ve had a good season, and we
have a lot to look forward to,
especially the regionals in March.

Kent State is in the past; what we
have to worry about is the future.”

 

RIFLERESULTS

The Pitt riﬂe team ended its
season with a bang Friday by
gunning down Indiana (Pa.) and
Geneva in a triangular meet. The
Panthers scored l3l8 points, beat-
ing the league-leading Indians

second place in the division.

Wildcats Claw Pantherettes

ByMARY.S.HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Wnter

The Pantherette basketball squad
proved it is capable of beating a
nationally ranked team, beating
10th-rated St. Joseph’s College,
77-70, Friday night at the Field
House.

The Pantherettes controlled the
game, taking their time setting up
plays and making good shots.
Above all, they played with desire.

Saturday night, against Villa-
nova, the Pantherettes looked like a
different ball club, and fell to the
visitors 69-67. The players were
mentally, physically and emotional-
ly drained according to coach Jean
Balthaser.

‘ ‘We couldn’t get it together after
last night.” Balthaser said, after
the Villanova loss. “We were
looking for a spark and it never
came.”

Friday night, the spark was there
throughout the game.

Despite a tough St; Joseph’s

press,-all ﬁve Pantherette starters
scored in double ﬁgures, with Robin
Fry and Wanda.Randolph leading
the way with 18 and 16 points,
respectively.

_ “Everyone played well,” said
Balthaser. “That’s what we’ve
been aiming for all year. We knew
what we had to do, and we didn’t
quit.”

“Wanda was a big factor in the
game,” she said. “She intimidated
St. Joseph’s.”

According to Balthaser, the
Pantherettes tried to dribble too
much in the ﬁrst half, but, in the
second half, they moved the ball
more to Randolph.

“Debbie Lewis had a good ﬂoor
game,” Balthaser said. “She ran
only when she was open moved the
ball inside well.”

Fry, who was 9 for 10 from the
ﬂoor, sank a 10-footer at the first
half buzzer to bring the Pantheret-
tes within 11, 39-28.

Fry continued her torrid shooting

in the second half, as the
Pantherettes gradually chipped
away at St. Joseph’s lead.

When the Pantherettes drew
within one point at the 12-minute
mark, St. Joseph’s employed their
press. Lewis, however, had no
trouble with it breaking open often
enough to garner nine assists.

Stripling converted a three-point
play with two minutes left to put the
Pantherettes ahead for good, 70-68.

It then became a matter of
running out the clock with Pitt
adding seven more points making
the ﬁnal score 77-70.

Saturday’s game pace was
considerably slower than Friday’s.
Four Pantherette starters again
scored in double ﬁgures, (Ran-
dolph, 18; Welsh 16; Lewis, 12, and
Stripling, 11), but Villanova’s
Kathy Straccia poured in 27 points
and was a key factor in the Wildcat
victory.

Winkler Waiting to Dive into Eastem Championships

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt diver Scott Winkler echoed
what almost every member of the
Panthers’ unbeaten swim team has
thought when he said, “dual meets
are great, but in the Easterns,
everyone likes to do well.”

The Panthers beat highly touted
Cleveland State Saturday, 78-34, at
Trees Pool to pull within a victory of
becoming Pitt's ﬁrst swim team
since 1948 to ﬁnish its dual meet
season undefeated. The.8-0 tankers
are now preparing for its final meet
and Eastern Championships, which
Pitt hosts March 2-4.

“Everyone wants to do well in the
Easterns,” Winkler said after
3% ‘ii; ayis W13. '-‘-‘l’-his seagaa has
been great for us as far as our point
totals are concerned. Every team
we’ve faced we have beaten almost
overwhelmingly.

“We’ve enjoyed our dual
meets,” Winkler continued, “and
we can’t wait to see how we’ll do in
the Eastems. It’s sort of like our
championship game.”

The Panthers, who have won the
Eastern team title for two years
running, will be looking to better
the record-breaking 498 points they
collected in last years’ champion-
ship. Winkler, a sophomore from
North Hills High School, hopes to
improve upon the fourth and ﬁfth

Pantherettes Blast Slippelyliock as Three Records Fall

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Three team records were broken
Saturday, when the Pitt women’s
track and ﬁeld team defeated
Slippery Rock, 87.5-27.5.

Leslie Palmer broke the 50-yard
hurdles record with a time of 6.9
seconds, while Michelle Bressant
placed second in the event in 7.25
seconds.

Lisa Haupt’s 59.4 seconds in the
440-yard dash electriﬁed the small
but enthusiastic crowd, while also
breaking a team record. Janet
Wilke placed second in that event.

The Pantherettes placed one, two

_ and three in the 220-yard dash as

Gwen Murray set a new team record
of 25.5 seconds. Lisa Sciullo took
second place, 27.7, and Susan Lewis
took third, 28.6.

Becky Falck won the three-mile
run at 18:24.5, as the second place
ﬁnisher crossed the ﬁnish line more
than two minutes later.

The only events Slippery -Rock
won were the shot put and 880-yard
relay. Marybeth Kulback (33 feet,
10 inches) and Carmen Scherich (33
feet, 8 and a half inches) placed

place ﬁnishes he captured in the
three-meter and one-meter diving
events.

Pitt, which has beaten Maryland,

SCOTT WINKLER

second and third, respectively in the
shot put for Pitt.

Slippery Rock’s win in the
880-yard relay was due to Pitt being
disqualiﬁed for being out of the
exchange zones. The Pantherettes
turned in a time of 1:46.5, while
Slippery Rock’s time was 1:51.7.
Another crowd pleaser was the mile
relay, which Pitt took easily in
4:12.3 to Slippery Rock’s 4:39.8.

Made Ribik won the high jump
with a leap of 5 feet, 6 inches.
Karen Kritchko and Pam Gearing
tied for second, both going out at 5
feet, 4 inches.

The 50-yard dash was closely
contested, with four runners
turning in times one tenth of a
second within each other. Gwen
Murray won the event at 6.13
seconds, while Lisa Sciullo tied for
third place at 6.2 seconds.

Other winners included Brenda
Chorpenning in the mile run
(5:23.7), Maria Sciullo in the 880
(2:29.5) and Terese Walton in the
two-mile (12:09.3).

Pitt will next host Penn State and
Kent State in a triangular meet
Saturday at the Field house.

 

West Virginia and nationally ranked
North Carolina must be considered
the team to heat. A 500-point team
total doesn’t seem out of its reach.

Winkler should do better this
year. The sophomore, who felt
proud just to make the travelling
squad last year, has consistently
placed among the top three divers in
both the one-and three-meter
competition in this year’s dual
meets.

With several members of last
year’s diving team gone—Tom
Faytol graduated and Dave Reeder
is sitting out this year to concentrate
on his pre-med studies—Winkler
has been forced to take _up the
leadership role on a squad
dominated by freshmen.

“This- is different for me,”
Winkler said. “Lastyear, Faytol
was a senior and Reeder (who
enters medical school next fall) was
a junior. I was a freshman, sol kind
of looked up to them for guidance.

"It’s the same kind of thing for
(freshman) Pat Greenweld and
Chris Mano,” Winkler continued.
“I’m the veteran. In a way, they’re
looking up to rne.”

Winkler sees the situation as one
that has helped the team.

“Since we are so young, I think
we’re a little closer than we were
last year. We sort of depend on
each other. Iknow when I'm diving,
Pat and Chris are rooting for me and

 

vice versa. It’s a healthy thing for

the team.”
For Winkler, Greenweld and

Mano, the season goes beyond the
Eastern Championships. A week
after the championships, all three
head to Penn State where they will
compete in the NCAA pre—qualiﬁ-
ers. If they should qualify there, it’s
off to the NCAA Championships at

Long Beach State in California.

But first things first, so Winkler
still has his mind on the Easterns, as
do most of the Pitt swimmers.

“We want to do well there,”
Winkler concluded. “There’s
nothing better than doing well in the
Easterns. It’s a challenge for us as a
team.’ ’

Swimmers Even Record

By KATHY SABA

The Pantherette swim team
upped its season record to 4-4 by
winning a quadrangular meet
Saturday at George Washington
University.

Pitt took top honors with 118
points, followed by Towsen State
(95), George Washington (33) and
Sheperd College (25).

The Pantherettes took ﬁrst place
in 11 of 17 events and placed ﬁrst or
second in five events.

Cindy Ferraro won both the
one-meter and three-meter diving
events, while ~€hrisrt>y -vE-lston
captured ﬁrst place in the 100-meter
freestyle and 100-meter backstroke.

Suzanne Pulley added ﬁrst-place
points by winning the 100-meter
individual medley and 50-meter
butterﬂy.

Patti Davis won the 50-meter

freestyle and placed second in the
50-meter butterﬂy and 100 meter-
freestyle. Co-captain Jaime Conley
set a team record in the 1650-yard
freestyle with a time of 18:44.45. A

ﬂu-stricken Kathy Stetler managed’

to win the 200-meter freestyle and
place second in the 100-meter
butterﬂy.

Stetler, Elston, Pulley and Denise
Flemming took ﬁrst place in the
200-meter freestyle relay.

“I saw the worst ofﬁciating down
their that I’ve ever seen in my life,”
said coach Kate Mathison. “There
were false starts in every heat but
