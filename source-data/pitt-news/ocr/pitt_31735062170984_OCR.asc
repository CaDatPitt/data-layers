Plimpton Discusses Alger

by BOB GING

"Is Horatio Alger Really
Dead?“ was the topic of a Mon-
day night lecture by George
Plimpton, author of The Paper
Lion. Plimpton, who character-
izes himself as a professional
.amateur, discussed his exper-
iences as a writer-participant in
several professional sports, in-

A: ,cluding football, basketball, box-

ing, and golf and the New York
Philharmonic.

The, themeiof his speech. "ls

‘ . Horatio Alger Really Dead?" is

reminiscent of the later-life of

S .19th century novelist Horatio Al-

ger. Alger, who Plimpton char-
acterized as a lifelong loser. fell
inlove with a married woman at

‘ the age of .63.

The woman’s husband took of-
fense at the possibility of a bud-
ding romance, and departed short-
ly thereafter with his wife, taking

her to France. His love gone and
unable to afford the fare to
France, Alger sat down and wrote
two books in 27 days, going to
France on the royalties.

When he finally encountered his
would-be lover. she refused to
have anything to do with him.

Plimpton began his career as a
professional-amateur on an_ as-
signment from the Harvard Lam-
poon, by entering the Boston Mar-
athon, a 27 mile endurance race.
Plimpton entered the race one
block from the finish, surpris-
ing the first place runner and los-
ing a last-minute sprint.

When the winner discovered
the hoax,” Plimpton said, “he
tried to hit me, but was to weak
to lift his arms.”

Plimpton said the most excru-
ciating experience of his life was
when he played for the New York
Philharmonic under the direction

Myth

of Leonard Bernstein. During his
short tour with the symphony he
pla_ved the bells, triangle and

gong. He related that one night.»

while playing the bells in London.
Ontario. he ruined an entire sym-
phony. Bernstein promptly fired
him.

The next night. thanks to the
persuasion of the percussion sec-
tion. Bernstein was going to per-
mit him to play the gong. the in-
strument which was the cres-
cendo of Tchaikovsky's Second
Symphony.

Told by Bernstein that he would '

receive a cue like no mucician had
ever seen, Plimpton said he re-
sponded by hitting the gong loud-
er than any one had ever hit the
gong.

After the concert.
congratulated him. saying. "If
Tchaikovsky had heard that.
which Fm sure he did. he would
have been delighted." ”

Plimpton's plans for the near V

future include three television
specials, including a fight with
former champion Mohammud Ali.
a ‘stint as professional goalie in
hockey, and as tambourine player

Conference Surveys
Services For Veterans

by DAVE MAJERNIK

A "Service to Veterans Conference." sponsored by the Pitt Vet-
erans Affairs Department and Point Park College. was held Satur-
day at Benedum Auditorium.

George C. Sell, president of Veterans at Pitt. was coordinator of
the conference, which was attended by some 50 directors of agencies
dealing with veterans and local employers.

The conference’s main purpose, according to Sell, was to present
a proposal for an Ex-Servicemen in Transition Center (EX-IT Center)
for Allegheny County. The facility would centralize veteran services
and “offer away in which agencies serving veterans may minimize
unnecessary waste, cost, and duplication, while maximizing success-
ful contact and service.”

Services that the proposed EX-IT Center would offer the Countys

‘ 54.000 Vietnam veterans, said Sell. are:

—-—Locating the returned veterans

——Initial counseling

——Informing the veteran of his benefits and rights

——Acting as an advocate for the veteran

——Housing as many governmental agencies serving veterans as will

cooperate
—-Offering services to veteran s’ dependents or survivors
——Acting as a referral agency

Funding for the EX—IT Center would hopefully come from pri-i

vate sources, rather than the government. said'Sell. 0 -

He pointed out that although the majority of Vietnam veterans are
poor and black. only four per cent have used their GI benefits. Many
veterans, said Sell, do not even know about the benefits due them.

Main speaker at the conference was Stuart Feldman, national
program coordinator, National League of Cities, U. S. Conference of
Mayors. Feldman discussed current legislation dealing with veterans
and use of GI benefits.

Other speakers included Dr. Alfred Moye. Vice-Chancellor of

Student Affairs, and Gary Wood. executive‘ director. Pennsylvania Pro-

‘ gram to ‘Advance Veterans‘ Education.

. The conference was a success, said Sell, and "got thetacit cooper-
ation (in organizing the EX-IT Center) from the regional office of the
Veterans Administration, and the cooperation. of the University, the
Pittsburgh Council of Higher Education. the Red Cross, and the Nation-
al Alliance of Business."

'Sell_said there are about4,000 veterans currently enrolled at the
University, which Veterans at Pitt tries to help by lobbying in legis-

\ latures, and informing them of policy changes dealing with veterans’

benefits.

On this campus of 30.000 stu-

. dents. for some strange reason.
'__.-‘I, the Allocations Committee does
A‘ not feel that publications are an
important part of intra—University

' ‘communications.

. ' The'"‘Allocations Committee is
J currently in the process, in con-
junction with the Student Gov-
ernment Board, of designing bud-
. "gets-for the 1973-74 school year.
The amount of incoming money

is the same as that of this past
 year. However, publications‘
 budgets are being cut considera-

_V\*l»=.' it is. I'm not really sure.
but I tend to be wary of people
_ »who wear jackets or sweatshirts
"  embl;izone‘d with"‘P,itt" or "Uni-
 versi i y of Pittsburgh".
 In ai way. I guess part of the
 explanation lies in my attitude
toward any kind of "billboard“
,clothing: most of it _is neither
'A’.impre.ssive nor entertaining. and
_  the whole is downright stu-
"5 pid. Clothes can /give messages
 enough without having them lit-
’ erally "spelled out“.

 
  
 
  
   
  

‘ . ‘For instance. a man who wears

  a coat or outfit of divers colors
 is oiiviously very religious. He
‘ is simply trying to emulate the
« Old 'i‘estament's Joseph and his
V 'snazz3.joutl’it..

 

‘ -On the other hand. a woman
 who dresses garishly is show-
 ,ing the-pride she feels toward
._ ‘her own national origins. Such
Q,’  a,‘ female may well be the color-
~~ fully clad bride in that favorite

V _ So it was with this basic aver-
‘ 7 . sion towards Pitt-lettered cloth-
ing and its wearers that I "came
 face-to-face with a situation
 wheie I couldlsee how fairly I
.. was judging these people.
.. I ‘had gone out with a friend
.  to look at used cars. If this gives
5,; ‘ .‘you’some clue as to what comes
"  "next. you are following along
. ‘nicely. Fortunately for me. my
friend was buying.
 We arrived at the first and
"  most promising prospect, a Volks-
! wagen Fastback. circa 1967. My
 keen eyes told me that it was
A‘ something less than a prizewin-
 .ner, having been repainted and
tampered with by some un-
‘ known car freak. The poorly ap-
plied tape racing stripes were a
. dead giveaway.

. We rang the apartment of the
 showca-r's owner and he show-
‘ - ed" up after a small delay. If the
‘_ sight of the car clouded my
, ' mind with doubt. then a storm
. of suspicion broke loose when
the fellow appeared wearing a
 "University .of Pittsburgh" sweat-

‘  , shirt.
He did. not look like a Pitt
student. I am well acquainted
with the many varieties of fruits
and nuts that go to our school.

and this guy was not one of them.

eas’Hit byAllocations’ Irigure

stead of listening to reasoning
behind a group's request for a
specific budget, the Committee
decided what the allocation would
be before publications presented
their need for the requested

- funds.

The publications in question
are Ideas and Figures, the Pitt
Capsule and Eureka! 1 _

Talking figures, the respective
budgets were cut from I&F
from $3875.00 to $1075.00; $3588.-
00 to $1745.00 Pitt Capsule and
from Eureka! $6.239 to $3.143.
But the rationale behind the cuts
is absurd.

The Allocations Committee and
SG feel that Ideas and Figures
does not have a large audience,
. that I&F caters to a literary elite
on the campus—the elite that are
interested in student poetry
and prose.

‘Taking this into consideration,
then, the Pitt Capsule and Eu-
reka! are also “elite” publica-
tions, because they too, cater to
‘a specific audience—those inter-
ested in the scientific happenings
at the University, and those in-

student‘! has he trying to impress
the two Pitt students at his front

door?

This brings to mind a high
school girl I knew of who was
attending .(,‘arnegie-Mellon's Pre-
College art classes a few years
ago. I don't think she ever got
accepted at CMU as a full-time
college student. but sure enough
she stuck the colleges decal on
the back window of her car. Bad
show.‘

I also recall a similar case in-
volving a young. man.who was
accepted at Duquesne. One of his
first acts after entering that
university was to apply Duquesne
stickers to his cars windows.
This fellow dropped out after a
brief stint.

As it turned out. my friend
bought the Volkswagen. but not
before we convinced the seller-
in-a-sweatshirt that his car wasn't
worth near the price he was ask-
ing. We soon found out it was
worth even less. '

When the heater was turned
on. the car’s ir_1terior took on
the unmistakable odor of engine
exhaust

The manual transmission had
a car nut"s "quick throw"-type
mechanism that gave the shift
lever at least three positions for
first gear. and made reverse a
sometimes thing. Besides. the fan-
cy chrome knob came off in my
friend‘s hand once as he went
from first to second.

A bad rear axle and a capri-
ciousjcarburator were two more
fine points of this automobile.
The cars need for extensive re-
building apparently played- a
major role in my friend’s deci-
sion to sell the car.

The next buyer also sold. By
my ca'lculations. the car is by
now at least- fifth-hand. being
no less-than second-hand when
my friend bought it. Hot items
move fast.

lt's risky to conclude from one
incident that all people who wear
Pitt sweatshirts and the like are
disreputable, or at least run-of-
the-mill used car salesmen. But
still there is one compelling rea-
son to shy away from clothing
lettered for the University of
Pittsburgh: at least people won't
think you re out to rook them.

terested and involved in the

School of Pharmacy.

It seems to me this reasoning
is absurd. for everyone has some
special interest in a publication.
or even within a publication.

Eureka! requested permission
to publish (6) issues next year.
because they said, “student reac-
tion to the first edition was very
good. the staff is more than will-
ing to work and there is a vast
expanse of research going on
here at the University. especially
by undergraduate and graduate
students that will not be pub-
lished anywhere else.“

Allocations said that since
Eureka! is a new publication
they. "should prove themselves
this year. and then (perhapsi
funding will be increased the
following year.“ I&F also receiv-
ed the same rationale that if a
good magazine was published
next fall. perhaps funding could
be found for a second and third.

Why does the Allocations
Committee consider themselves
judges on literary or journal-

material? And what does it take
to prove a good magazine to
them? After all, each copy of
the winter term’s Ideas and Fig-

ures was sold (at 25¢) and all

It would seemthat the teachers
are expressing an over-anxious
reaction against the recent state
cutbacks. They want» to protect
their present rights but at whose

that ‘the stronger the AFT be-

comes the weaker the students

voice will be. Since the University

administrators are forced to allo-
cate according to the stated ends.

copies of Eureka! were also dis-
tributed within a _few hours of
its publication.

In preliminary meetings with
the Allocations Committee and
Ideas and Figures, copies of
other university literary maga-
zines were shown to the Com-
mittee. Many were larger than
I&F, with full color covers plus
inside color. "Why can't you
produce something like this?"
Allocations asked. But the Com-
mittee had not checked into
printing costs. and arbitrarily de-
cided on a figure for production
costs. Now. that's competence.

One reason Eureka! was given
funding for three magazines in-
stead of six was because the Al-
locations Committee felt’ that
"such a heavy publication sche-
dule would detract from the
quality of the magazine. espe-
cially with such a tight,publica—
tion schedule and an academic
work load."

It is touching that the Allo-
cations Committee would be con-
cerned about the welfare of the
students’ academic life. How-
ever, their concern is unfounded,
for these students are like staff
members of other publications
and for themﬂschool work is work-

Unions, especially the rambling
AFT, are unprofessional. The
NEA at least “recognizes its re-

today, it~is hard to find a differ-
ence between a union boss and a

‘manager, they ‘have the same

goals.

I say that you teachers can't
give up and join a union, the state
has cut our budget and you must
suffer as students and adminis-
tration are suffering.

I hope that this letter can serve
as sort of an upwards communica-
tions to the teachers. As a stu-
dent. 1' see the role of'teacher as
not to unionize but to cooperate
with the administration so we can
do likewise towards you.

ed around a deadline, not vice
versa.

Now for some ideas: It is one
of the fundamental duties for
a University ,to teach writing.
which is communication with

   

S’

others, and to encourage its stud- . '

ents to practice their writing in
publications. Many students at the
undergraduate level do not have
the technique or style to. be
published in national journals.
and that's where undergraduate
publications, such as Ideas- and
Figures, Eureka! and the Pitt
News lend guidance, encourage-
ment and practical experience
as student publications.

Cutting these necessary tools
for learning doesn't he_lp to im-
prove the publications on this
campus; they can only hinder
their development. The Alloca-
tions Committee, by telling the
publications that they don‘t de-
serve their needed amount of
funding because some publica-
tions admittedly cater to their
specifically interested. audience.
is in a sense dictating to the edi-
tors of these publications that
Allocations will fund only what
they feel interests the students.
which is, in a form, censorship.

The Allocations Committee feels
that, “Editorial policy is/la privi-
lege.” And, “It is difficult to
equate publications against fin-

ances, because publications are '

personal things and ideas. There
is no rational basis on how to

‘do it, but that’s what we did.”

Publications are ideas of stud-
ents at the University. communi-
cating with other students. both
here and outside the Pittsburgh
area. Figures control the econo-
mics of our lives; they are evil
necessities. _Th‘e. Allocations Com-
mittee, and Student Government
for that matter, appear to be short-
sighted when it comes to the pri-
orities of. learning processes in-
volved in student publications.

The Allocations committee will
not see an improvement in pub-
lications this year because they
cut budgets. Pitt will not be able
to compete in the areas of stud-
ent publications. Allocations have
won the battle with figures, at
least for now. but they have
squelched ideas here at the Uni-
versity.

Editor:

l would like to commend ttie
editorial stance of the Pitt News
with regard to the recent unwar-
ranted interference of the Student
Government Allocations Comit-
tee with the editorial poli-
cies and decisions of Ideas and
Figures.

Having been present at the I& F
allocations and appeal meetings
I was impressed by the seeming
ignorance -which the Allocations
Committee displayed with respect
to the purpose of that publica-
tion and the traditions of editorial
freedom and autonomy essential to
a free student press,

Ideas and Figures is by nature
a magazine of literature and the
graphic arts. Yet the Committee
asked why it did not publish
scientific articles for the sake of
diversity! The temerity of the
magazine in printing four poems
by the same (unusually good»
author was also the subject of
considerable interrogation—-as if'
the balance of innate quality to
diversity in selecting submis-
sions for publication were not
the duty and prerogative of the
magazine's owneditorial staff!

To insure the accordance of
I & F withvtheir orders the Com-
mittee is only funding the first
of the magazines two annual
editions. the funding for the
second to come in the middle of
next year—if the magazine suits
them with the first.

While we should all recognize
that ‘Student Government has
less money to work_with this fis-

cal year than last. still it is im-
proper for the Allocations Com-
mittee to try to set themselves
up as a board of Super-E.ditors
over all publications, I would
like to see the SG Board in\esii—
gate the excessive zeal of this
Committee in controlling stu-
dent publications. and I hope
that in the future the Committee
will come to fulfill its one pro-
per function of allocating funds
as fairly as possible—not man-
aging other students‘ organiza-
tions.
Yours very truly.

1 would like to offer a state-

Ball. The article of March 14 was
so absurdly inaccurate and big-.
otted that it dipped into the
area of slander. I was present at
the Military Ball and talked with
many of the people who attend-
ed——both during the evening and
afterwards—~and found that the
opinions published in your paper
are shared by _one person only-—
the author.

Let's look at some of the points

of the article: l~'irst ll mentions

Cartoon

Dear Editor.

Last year at this time. The Pitt
News published several of Mr.
Mater‘s cartoons dealing with
the Greek System. Although they
may have been applicable to
some fraternities (and sororities»
the fact remains that the'report-
ersv chose to completely ignore
the Greek Week festivities.
at the same time printing anti-
Greek cartoons. They also failed
to report about the thousands
of dollars collected for charity
and the hundreds of pints of
blood donated by Greeks.

‘This year. the Pitt News has
chosen to follow its same one-
sided policy. although not to the
same extent. thanks to a small ar-
ticle on page 5 of the March 26
edition. and the omission of Mr.
Mater's cartoons (hes probably
too busy
caricatures). which have been re-
placed by Mr. Zrust‘s. His im-
pressions of the various chariots
are quite humorous. but with a

woman has made numerous learn-

lit a more quiet way. Dayitt \is—
ser radiatcs the same attitudes
towards puppetry wliich Margo
holds. He. too. is concerned with
maintaining the highest standards
in both childrens and adult en-
tertainment. He shows a feeling
for the craft that can be expected:
he was borninto it.

"What makes puppetry such a
good medium." he explains. "is
that the ego of the actor has no
chance to interfere with the ego
of the characters. A puppet show

- can be more dignified becauseoi
.this. Most actors make poor pup-

petecrs because they've been
trained to convey feelings through

"their own bodies. By the same

token. most puppeteers make very

poor actors. because they have

learned to transfer their feelings

_ into inanimate o_bje-cts..‘.‘

Asdirector, it is David’s job to
choose the scripts and decide how
they _will be’ presented. For
children’s productions, the choice
will usually be a. fairy tale. But
the adult shows present "more of
a problem. i -

“We -cant ever have anything
by Shakespeare.’ Anything with
long speeches would get boring
because puppets can never do the
intricate’ facial
gesturesneeded to keep a long pas-
sageinteresting. .

"Also. -the‘ characters them-
selv_e_s cannot be ,’too‘-complex.
Thisis why the best scripts are
the fairy tales. faces. or satires.
These deal mainly with stereo-
typed. easily recognized figures.

“We’ve done a plot of ‘French
plays for our adult productions.-
Cocteau, Giradoux, and now

Moliere to name a few. The:

French seem to have an under-

'community

by MIKE COYNE

In the 12th and 13th Wards of
the city, comprising the Home-
wood, Brushton, and Belmar
areas, 1972 figures show a con-
firmed hard drug addict popula-
tion of over 2,800. Some_ esti-
mates of the number of unknown
addicts raise this figure to as high
as 10 per cent of the over 50,000
residents. '

One of the approximate 20 pro-
grams which were implemented
to combat Pittsburgh‘s addictive
drug problem is FACE, In., a
therapeutic center
founded in August, 1970, and still
active in its original headquar-
ters at 521 N. Homewood Ave., in
Homewood;

FACE, Inc. (the acronym comes
from the full name “Family Ad-
diction Control and Education,

Inc.), was conceived and origin-'

ally executed by several local
people who had themselves under-
gone treatment through the Phoe-
nix House program in New York
City. They returned to Pittsburgh
and felt the pressing need for
such a program in the Homewood
area.

FACE, -called for "a compre-
hensive and integrated drug pro-
gram of services (which). will
insure
meetthe individual needs of each
addict, and not just the limited
approach to certain types of
drug problems."

In itsearly days FACE found
itself operating out on the street
corner as much as from its walk-
in Day Care center. The first
year-and-a—half the ' organization
worked without heat in their build-
ing. Therapy sessions were held
in overcoats.

The family (as FACE residents
and staff members alike refer to
themselves) quickly determined

, that they would need some kind of

detoxification ‘program if they
were to have any real success.

‘ FACE picketed St. Francis Hos-
pital for a detox unit and gotone

a willingness and determination
to kick the habit.'Residents—-who
have a strong voice in all in-house
decisions—lower staff. and ad-

ministration decide if the individ- '

ual is really serious about getting
out of the drug scene. If so he is
graduated to St. Francis Hospital.

Unlike such programs as Alpha
House and Ile Elegba, which want
only clean residents who have
kicked their habit cold turkey (the
rationale is that this gives the ad-
dict a stake of sorts in his own
success), FACE offers a 14 day
program of detoxification and
general health care. The St. Fran-
cis facility is equipped with seven
beds—they are usually flill—and

 

     
    

employs five nurses and five full
time counselors. Residents at this
stage attend three therapy ses-
sions each day.

Michele Hart. the unit‘s head
nurse. says residents are put on a
six day schedule for heroin with-
drawal. a 10 day schedule for
withdrawal from a methadone
habit. Gradual withdrawal is cou-
pled with\ comprehensive health
and dental care. Addicts often
have nutrition and health prob-
lems that are dealt with during
this phase. In one case a FACE
walk-in had both hepatitis and
pneumonia.

- The detoxed resident spends
most of his time—two months. on
an average—with the "family."

Residents report to the Day
Care Unit five days a week and
are expected to sign in promptly
at 8. The first hour of the day is
spent in general clean-up.

At 9 each morning the resi-
dents and lower staff—all of
whom have been through the nee-
dle scene-_-have a general'meet—
ing to set the mood for the day.
An essential part of the meeting.
in fact of the wllole program. is
image-breaking. The FACE phil-
osophy holds that there are cer-
tain negative behavioral traits
“which tend to keep the person
enmeshed in the web of drub ad-

"diction."
“You get some guy in here." ,

said Georgia Radler. a lower- staff
member who was extremely help-
ful in providing much of the infor-
mationin this article. "who has
this gangster image of himself
and everyone says, ‘let's do a bal-
let." Well. that image isn't going
to last -too long."

When the morning meeting ends
at 10, residents go to their”re-
spective jobs. They do all the
maintenance work on the pre-
mises. 'I;his included turningthe

With national elections now

A over. and local elections upcom-
‘ing.

the Pitt News wanted to
know how the politically-orient-
ed campus organizations perceiv-
ed the role of the student in poli-
tics. Leaders of the College
Young Democrats iCYDi. Col-
lege Young Republicans. and Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society
tSDS). were interviewed and
this is what they had to say:

Sam Rosenweig. president of
the CYD. feels that the affect
a student can have on change
in a society is unlimited. "Most
students only have a national per-
spective of politics. primaril_y
becauseiof the Vietnam War.

.'~ but they have far more impact
on local_ issues." he claimed. As‘

an example, he’ pointed out that
if students would mobilize they
would have a strong voice in
electing state legislators. and an
even more powerful role in the
city—council and mayorality elec-
tions. It only takes approximately
20000 votes to win a council
seat. and Rosenweig noted that
the Pitt enrollment alone exceeds
that number.

in-
he

As an illustration of the
crease of student influence.

rs stated that. one year ago. an 18

year—old drinking bill was un-
likely. but now it is possible.
"The legislators noted that stu-
dents turned out to vote in
the last election. In the campus
area—-six district. four ward—ap-
proximately 80 percent of the stu-
dents registeredturned out. If
this trend continues. the impact
of the student will be great.“
he stated.

Rosenzweig pointed out. that
Allegheny County has one of the
highest percentages of youth

registration in the country. but
unless the youth votes. it has a
mere "paper-tiger“ effect. "The
only thing you can ask is that they
vote. The more they vote. the
more impact they liaye.” he con-
cluded.

College Young Republican
president Chuck Steeber also serves
as chairman of Washington County
republicans. He feels that stu-
dents should very much play a
part in politics. but he does not
view them as a new_voting~fac—
tion. "They're no different than
the old. blacks. or other groups.
and in most cases they align with
their parents.” he said.

Steeber emphasized that "right"
doesn‘t mean ''action.’’ "A lot of
young people are turned—ol'f by
the whole political system. They,
are impatient. Students won't be
any more active until you convince
them that their vote counts]? ‘he
stated. How might this be done‘?
Steeber maintained that it is an
inevitable ciiicular problem: “In
order to get students to vote. you
have to first show them results.
but no resultscan be obtained
without involvement.“ He then
added: “Its one thing to vote.
and another to get involved—-
in a party. campaign. etc. Stu-
dents must exert their influence
before voting day. and work to
get youth elected. 7‘

that students have a "progres-

sive" influence on society. es-
pecially in the "anti-racism"
movement. Lindsley said that
students can exert this influence
through two main ways: by per-
ceiving/what they are now and
what they will be. Explaining
further. she noted that the stu-
dents today hold the key roles
of tomorrow as teachers and

other professionals—positions from.

which influence is generated.
“The main goal should not ne-
cessarily be to get integrated

into poltics. but rather to form a-

the schools and community."
Lindsley emphasized. Schneirov
said that "politics“ does not ne-
cessarily refer to election.poli-
tics. but rather societal politics.
such as the application of col-
lege work to life. Supporting
Lindsley's perspective. he added:
"The government blames problems
on the very victims of those
problems.‘This has an effect on
attitudes of people who will be
professionals in society. who. in

turn. affect others. "

Lindsley attributes non-involve-
ment in trying to change society
to cynicism: "Many students do

their current release. will appear
at the Syria Mosque Saturday at

Well-known within certain cir-

at age nine. Later the driving beat
of rhythm and blues convinced
him to beat upon the skins.

Seals and Crofts met in high
school. in 1958. they headed West
where. with several others. they
formed the "Champs." who were
well known for their hit single.
"’l‘equila.“

For seven years they lived as
rock star degenerates, before the
“Champs” collapsed to form the
“Dawnbreakers,”‘ a pseudo-soul
group with three female singers.

Things were going absolutely
nowhere when the shining light
of the Bahai Faith appeared. This
mellowed their music and forced
them to express their sound
through mellower means. Unable
to create harmonies on the drums.
Dash picked up the mandolin. The

result will be at the Mosque April7.

More on the best of the latest:

Jim Croce’s Life and Times . . .
Croce is basically a "shot and
beer” guy. but manages to cap-
ture some truly beautiful senti-
ments on his second outing.

Opening with his current single,
“One Less Set of Footsteps,” and
going through such epics as “I
Fell in Love with a Roller Derby
Queen” (who is 5’6” and 215 lbs.
bleached blonde mama with a
streak of mean”), and “Bad, Bad
Leroy Brown” (sounding alot like

i- “Don’t Mess Around with Jim”)

to end up with a captivating “It
Doesn’t Have To Be That Way,”
Croce shows more of the talent
that was so evident in his first
LP.

Somehow. I was never able to
get into the Stones‘ albums when
they first came out—they had to
grow on me. Maybe age has ma-
tured me. but theys really got
something. even though it's taken
awhile to realize it. One thing

Botanical Art Exhibited

The Hunt Institute for Botanical
Documentation at t,‘arnegie-l\«lel-
lon will present an exhibit of bo-
tanical art by CMU students April
14-May 18. \

Titled "Art Students—Botani-
cally Involved." the show is the
first exhibit of botanical ‘art by
CMLI students at the Institute.

bum More Hot Rocks (Big Hits
and Fazed Cookies, which is an-
other attempt at a "greatest hits"
package. so that London can make
money now that the Stones have
their own label.

But inadvertently, London has
done the record buyer a favor.
’l‘hey’ve let loose on an unsuspect-
ing public a collection of record-
ings showing the basic roots of
this group of all groups, including
songs even Stones’ aficionados
haven’t heard before, ’cause they
were never before released.
Tracks like “Money,” Chuck Ber-
ry’s “Come On,” “Fortune Tell-
er,” and the Coasters’ biggie,
“Poison Ivy.” The last track alone
is worth the entire price of the
album.

Stones freaks probably have all
the other cuts. but the eight new
_ones will make you scurry. lf the
group hasn't been your bag. try
this one: its your history and
about as good a collection of “rep-
resentative" Stones" music as
could be found.

Works include painting and sculp-
ture and design and architecture.
The exhibit is free to the pub-
lic; hours are Saturday and Sun-
day, April 14 and 15, 1-5 p.m., and
weekdays, 9 a.m.-5 p.m., through
May 18. The Institute is in the pent
house of the Hunt Library at CMU.

It’s better than the ordinary,

the three vocalists give the other

their own little solo spots. This
group is one of the few who sound
better in concert than they do on
record—studio perfection isn’t al-

A graph of the progi‘ess of any
artist is certain to show patterns
of oscillations. reflecting tri-
umphs. frustrations. and ever
continuing expansion. Nobodys
chart fits such description better
than Harry Cardillos

'l‘he former ‘pianist of iVlatrix.
the local jazz combo. Cardillo de-
cideo to ieave tne‘ ensemoie to
further explore his potential. Car-
dillo admitted that he is “hesitant
to call myself a professional but
rather I'm more of a student."

Matrix is planning to enter the
record market soon, which is one
of the reasons Cardillo resigned.

"In my experience with Matrix.
I learned a lot." he acknowledged.
“and I thought I might head that
way (to make recordsi. But I
know I have a long way to go be-
fore I could produce a product
that I‘d be satisfied with. Even
though I could now give 100 per
cent. I wouldn‘t be satisfied." _

Cardillo feels. "Analbum's an
achievement, a message to the

public. A message should be an
image of you. what you're about.

“I’m resolved to find out exact-
ly what I'm capable of doing. It’s
a big learning trip, and you have
to walk before you can run. It’s
two years since I’ve been study-
ing jazz, and I don't consider my-
self a jazz player yet.”

He strives to "learn by listen-
ing. M_v ears are my biggest tool.
not only my physical ears. but my
inner hearing as well.“

So the musician has opted to
take his second major “sabbati-
cal“ in quest for self-develop-
ment. The first metamorphosis
was when he began his study of
jazz. prior to weaving the frame-
work for Matr_ix.

“I was in Barefoot, a money-
making group, which was my last
trip with rock and roll. I could
only go so far with rock. For me
it was a dead end, a sour business
which was limiting and frustrat-
mg.”

Because he studied classical,

music for 13 yearsk Cardillo

“Jazz is more expressive. a
player’s music." he commented.
but insisted he is not downgrad-
ing rock. “It's not a matter of put-
ting one ahead of the other. and
I (praise any musician who can.
play well and with feeling.‘

Now in phase two of his transi-
tion to jazz, Cardillo again feels
that he’s “back to the state of

‘ mind where it’s time for a change.
. It’s music for music’s sake,” he

philosophized, “a financial goal
would be self-defeating. The mu-
sical aspect must precede re-

“I enjoy recruiting [and travel-

NCAA regulations" prohibited
Majors from announcing the
names of recruits, but he did
mention that he has about 20 from
Pennsylvania, including 10 from
Southwestern Pennsylvania and
four from Erie. “We did real well
in Ohio too,” he said.

The team will practice through
tomorrow. then take a week oft
for finals before returning to the
stadium turf. The drills will cul-
minate with the annual Blue-Gold
game. which will be held on May

 In addition to building a winning football program here.

 funds designated to other varsity sports. and every one

. A good example of this is Penn State. After several years of

post-season bowl participation. the Nittany Lions now have a
brand new field house. and one of the top Eastern/teams in al-

" Not only does the extra money provide for more scholar-
ships and better facilities: but. the prestige of a winning foot-
ball team makes it easi'er to get prospects to come here. I
g  , A winning grid team could improve the facilities here tre-
mendously. Tennis coach Fran Webster would love to see indoor
courts built, and several indoor track facilities, including the
rig jump. and high jump, leave something to be desired.

 Not only the spring sports have been cut back. The gymnas-
.ies.'.team. which has just announced that Ig Perez is the new
coach. is trying to get out of the Eastern Gymnastics League

time to sit down and eyaluate our

Majors will use the spring drills
to get some kind of an idea of
what types of offense and defense
to use. “We’ll start out with the
“I” formation on offense,” he
said. “I’ve heard people call it the
power “I,” but I don’t know how
much power we have. The defense
will be a 4-4-3.

"We don't know which offense‘

and defense we will use." he add-
ed. "Well .base our offense and
defense on two things: our per-
sonnel and our opposition."

Majors will have some out-

 lege transfers on his roster this

fall. but he isn't downgrading the
returnees from last years squad.
"We have confidence in the kids

Catching up is indeed one of
Majors’ many tasks. “I don’t

Majors may have as many as 50

Perez To Pick Up L
Flight Of Gymnastics

by RON SIEGEL .
Sports Editor

Pitt‘s gymnastic team has a
new. head coach. and if his en-
thusiasm rubs off on the alumni.
the team may move out of the cel-_
lar of the Eastern Gymnastic
League. The new coach is Ig Per-
ez. and he succeeds Warren Neig-
er. who has been the coach for a
long while.

Perez is 29 years old. and has
served as assistant coach here at
Pitt and also at Army. He was the
co-captain of Pitt‘s gymnastic
team in 1967, and sees this as "an

' opportunity to redeem all the for-

mer Pitt gymnasts. I‘m also going
to end the humiliation of having
to explain to alumni why were
losing." Pitt has been at the bot-
tom of the Eastern League for
about 10 years.

The road ahead is not an easy
one for Perez. .He is losing all six
of his scholarship gymnasts. with
only a few walk~ons returning.
Due to the increase in football
spending; the money Perez has
to work with has been cut in half.

But Perez is full of ideas and
hope. He is going after all the
alumni he can, as he neees more,
not less money than the team has
been receiving. “Eastern Gym-
nastic rules require three all-

around men, but Pitt hasn't had
one in years,” said Perez. Perez
is also trying to get an assistant
coach, preferably Japanese. “The
Japanese have mastered the
sport,” pointed out Perez. Most
other Eastern schools have two-

or three assistants. I’ll be lucky ~

iflgetone. '
A total of eight names were

he submitted to Athletic Director

Casimir Myslinski. From this
list. four "finalists" were chosen.
Perez is good friends'with all
eight nominees. "I had the sup-
port o_f the team. of past captains.
and of the alumni." he stated.
“That’s why I got the job."

''We‘ve got to do a vast amount
of reorganization.” he points out.
And he’s got a portfolio full "of
plans on how to do it.

Perez is well known in the area,
and feels that Western Pennsyl-
vania is a good source of gym-
nastic talent. It’d better be, be-
cause it's much cheaper to fund.
Pennsylvania students, and no-
body knows it better than Perez.
“This is- a great area, but only
one- out of the six graduating sen-
iors are from this area,” he ex-
plains. '

If enthusiasm could win gym-
nastics -meets. Pitt would have a
perfect r/ecord. It's going to take

’ terna tional

money though, and maybe Perez
enthusiasm will help there too.

Perez has plans to promote
gymnastics in the area as well.
-“I'm, trying to get some of the in-
gymnastic teams
teams ‘that tour the country to
stop in Pittsburgh," he explained.
'_‘I"m also trying to get the region-
al AAU‘s to be,held here." Other

Perez projects include an alumni

organization and a portfolio of
prospective recruits. which he
has already compiled.

Boxing has always fascinated

thousands of acid-tongued critics.
I’ve often wondered if I could do
it, so last year I trained myself
by running laps at the fieldhouse
and punching a small speed bag
in the cellar, and entered myself
in the annual tournament, which
is comprised of AAU amateur box-
ers in the tristate area. I fought
as a subnovice, that is, with no
previous sactioned ring experi-
‘ence and did alright making "the

Last week. Hidl announced the
signing of Oliver star Frank Boyd
for next years basketball squad.
Boyd averaged 20 points for the
last three years at the North Side
school and also scooped up an av-
erage of 17 rebounds in that same
period of time. Boyd is 6-1. 180
pounds and is expected to play
guard. And. speculation on other

_ Pitt signings is running high.

Ridl doesn‘t think he Wlll re-
cruit any more guards. but he is
looking for a couple of big men as
well as three or" four players in
the 6-4. 6-7 hieght range.

Reportedly. Ringold's 'Ulice
Payne is still interested in Pitt
and could eventually sign. Hidl is
also reportedly high on Eric
Strong Vincent's Essie Hollis and
Keystone Oaks Jack Werner.
But he is not alone in his desires.

Payne has been contacted by all
the top schools in the ‘country and,
his decision will be a tough one,
to say the least. He has shown
interest in - Minnesota, Notre
Dame, UCLA, and Maryland, to

1 name a few.

Werner has'drawn the interests
of Virginia Teclii winners of the re-
cent National Invitational Tour-

nament. In fact. Werner will visit

Virginia Tech this weekend. while
Hollis will visit Maryland.

Pitt is extremely interested. One
source said that Holmes deserved
to be in the Roundball Classic

. himself. but it was not in the bet-

the same high school.

While speaking of Adrian Dant-
ley. it's worth mentioning that
John Majors‘ football
very interested in Dantley as a
football recruit. Dantley has re-
ceived close to 300 offers to play
collegiate basketball and close to
50 offers for the gridiron.

“Of course we are-interested in
him,” said Pitt grid assistant Joe
Madden. “We’d be fools not to be.

We’ve already signed a running
back from DeMatha Catholic, a
boy by the name of DeRoy, and
h'e’s a real good one too.

However. Dantley will probably
choose basketball for his collegi-
ate career.

According to Bobby Lewis. who
has coached the Pitt Panther
baseball team for the last 19
years. George Medich has earned
a spot on the roster of the New
York Yankees team.

Attired in his usual outfit, white
shorts and a Pitt baseball jacket,
Lewis beamed with pride as he
gave the news.

’”I‘m pretty sure George has
made it with the Yankees. Willie
l\/lyei's——former Pitt trainer-

was in New York and saw one of '

the papers. The paper said that
one of the spots on the Yankee
pitching staff would go to either
Medich or a lefthander. The next
day. Medich pitched eight innings
against the Baltimore Orioles and
allowed two runs. And the left-
hander was released. ,

Golfers
Season

The Pitt golfers opened their
season on Tuesday by defeating

Duquesne and Geneva College in
a triangular meet at Green Oaks.

“It was a hideous day to play
golf." commented team captain
Steve Koslac about the slightly
wet conditions. "We were more
worried about staying dry than
playing golf."

The linksmen beat Duquesne
and Geneva each by a score of
4.1.2-21./'2 with Steve Koslac. Mark
Hoffman. Jim Vent, Ed Weiszy-
ski. Rich Thomas, and Tim To-
amlti scoring for the Panthers.
Ed Bullano was out for the match
and Bob Brouman out for the sea-
son with a torn cartilage.

Friday, April 6, l973—THE PITT NEWS—-Page -19 V

  The Sage Of AllaquippaStreet

(Contilzued from Page 18)

a black X running through them
and others are ‘deXed.” When-
ever a Pitt coach and/or personality
leaves the University or is fired,
an X is placed ver the picture, sig-
nifying the absence. If that person
sould ever return, he is ‘deXed,’ to
show the re-appearance.

One day Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var entered the Mausoleum and
asked about the pictures. After an

-explanation Posvar decided he

didn't like his picture and vowed
to send another.

"He said ‘Keep that one there
‘til I send another,‘ the Horse re-
called. "I think he forgot. I haven't
received it yet." .

The de-fumbleizer is another
tradition. It consists of a hand

' jutting out of one of the walls.

A chain hangs from one of two
fingers, which in turn has a
football hanging from it.

f‘I got the hand out of the ana-
tomy department” recalls Czar-
necki. "Johnny Michelo1son_used
to borrow it to show his players
what he was going to do to them
if they didn’t quit fumbling the
ball. I don't think it ever worked.

"Pop Warner was before my
time. but when you‘re dead that
long and people still remember
you. you were either a thief or you
did something good. Two ex-

. amples of that were John Dillin-

ger and the Good Lord. Every-
body remembers them. Warner
was a winner and he must have
done a lot of good things."

Horse Czarnecki calls every-
body Gus. The reason is simple:
“I can’t remember all the peo-
ple I meet, so, I just say ‘how’ya
doing Gus.’ If they don’t like it
then they aren’t really my friend.

While Czarnecki might have some
trouble remembering names.
everybody knows who you mean
when you say Horse.

"Tom Hamilton—former Pitt AD
named me that.“ recalls Horse.
"We used to cover the field
with these covers before Astroturf
and one day Torn saw me pulling
this big wagon with these covers
on them. He asked somebody
‘who that Horse was’ and it just
stuck." '

Who else but Horse Czarnecki
could, have a real live horse

named after him. Art Rooney.

who has owned the Pittsburgh
Steelers for the last 40 years.
payed Czanecki the
merit.’

. "Yeah, I have a picture of the
horse, Horse Czarnecki, winning
a race in Charlestown. West Vir-
ginia. He paid $63.03 to win.
$28.00 to place, and $12.00 to
show.” Czarnecki whinnied.

And, how about his own vocabu-

lary? Here are a fes examples:
0rgulate—getting organized.
Sloveritis—Not even Horseknows
the meaning of this word.
Resornicator——what Czarnecki
calls himself for being on the job
for 26 years. .
Esophicate—unprintable.
Rhigamortis—when team looks.
terrible. Rhigamortix has set in.
Confusing? Well. when Horse
says "let's orgulate." his co-
workers know he means "let's
get organized."

_ Horse is married and has three
kids. And this’ left him room for
a parting shot.

"My son weighed 295 when he
