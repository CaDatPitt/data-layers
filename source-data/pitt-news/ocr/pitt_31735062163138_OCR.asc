Shown in Display

An exhibition of 25'watercolors
from the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation will be on display in
the foyer and marble lounge of
the Student Union starting today
and continuing until June 30.

This showing is one of a series
of three, each illustrating a dif-
ferent pictorial medium.

The. Foundation’s purpose in
making these exhibitions avail-
able to educational institutions
throughout the United States is to
foster an appreciation of contem-
porary art by acquainting the pub-
lie with a selective introduction
based on quality alone.

Artists represented in the ex-
hibit include William Baziotes,
Marc Chagall, Paul Klee, Albert
Gleizis, and other contemporary
painters.

Among the educational institu-
tions participating in the art loan
program during the ﬁrst half of
1960 are Dickinson College, Ham-

'Building Designed
To House Growing

Collection of Books
(See editorial, page. four)

Chancellor Litchﬁeld announced-
yesterday that the University will,

construct a $10 million central
library designed to house two and
one—half million volumes. '

The Hillman Foundation has

given the University a, gift of 3
million‘dollars for this library in
memory of the late Pittsburgh in-

dustrialist, John Hartwell’ .Hi1l— -

man, Jr. The library is to be nam-
ed The Hillman Library.

The General State Authority of’

the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-

vania has allocated the remain-'_T

ing $7 million for the library.
The building will border on
Forbes Street between Forbes

Field and the Student Union, but
will face Schenley Park. A por--

tion of the,Hillman bequest is in
the form of land which the Hill-
man family has held for many
years to donate for a ‘structure.
Land besides that donated by the
Hillman Foundation needed for
the Library is either owned or

in -the process of being purchased

by the University. .

The library will provide ap-
proximately 220,000 square feet of
space, the equivalent‘
acres, and will accommodate
2,400’ readers. The building will
serve as the keystone of a pro-
quad-
rangle. , -

Embodying a new concept in li-

brary design, each professional,
school will have its private li-9
brary but will functionwith the.

nected book stacks, reading rooms‘

n One less Wealr linlr

(See story, page one)

The Hillman Library and the books’ it houses will be
the future heart of this University.

One of the most obvious gaps in the physical plant has
been the absence of a‘ spacious central library building.
This, along with the deﬁciency in the number of books in
many areas of knowledge constituted one of the barriers
to heightened national stature for this University.

To the credit of Chancellor Litchﬁeld is his early rec-

‘. ognition of this weak spot in the University and his deter-

mination to do something about it. . -
In the address the Chancellor delivered at last Septem-

‘ ber’s Fall Convocation, he pointed out that the appropria-

tions for libraries has been increased 172% compared to
1956 figures. Staff costs had also gone up 54% so that suf-
ﬁcient assistance could be given by the library staff to as-
sure maximal use of the newly purchased books.

The University, said the Chancellor, was spending
nearly half ‘a million dollars on its libraries, but “this is not

enough.”

The "recent generosity of the Hillman Foundation is
notable and the Hillman Library will be a lasting monu-
ment to‘the late corporate. magnate, John Hillman.

I ‘The recognition by the General State Authority of their

-responsibility in providing a grant for this University’s

library may be an indication of an_ increased awareness by
the government, philanthropists and alumni, and industry

I of the necessity of providing adequate University- facilities.

The unique social professions quadrangle with sepa-
rate professional schools interlinked with their libraries

A , seems both practical and educationally realistic. In these

days of increased specialization, each area must neverthe-

less often seek out information in the literature of ‘others._

A’ ﬁne library will do more to increase scholarship at
the University than any other single facility. The library
is the cultural center of a University, a sine qua non of aca-

,-demic excellence. We look forward with pride tothe time of

its completion.

By Dr. Peter Gray

No part of the globe is more than 7 hours from

-your local airport. None is more than 40 minutes

from an atomic missile base. It is now time that
we stopped saying, “The world is getting smaller”
and realize that it has gotten small. And not only
realize this but actually do
something practical about it.. '

'There_ are relatively few
humans in the world—probably
fewer than there are ants in
Pennsylvania. There are also
fewer kinds of human than
there are kinds of mice in one
of my colleague’s laboratories.
Yet when I see i yellow mice,
brown mice, piebald mice, and
white mice living happily to-
gether in one cage and drinking
from a common bottle‘, I wonder why homoiis call-
ed sapiens. V

The “brotherhood” of man is not just a com-
forting religious s1ogan—it is a hard, brutal, fact
of life that has been apparent to zoologists for
nearly a century which is possibly why science is,
or at least was, completely international.

I hope you will not shy away fromlthis word.

One of the wickedest things that those communist —

rascals ever did was to steal the word interna-
tional as one of their slogans. It used to be a com-

‘live in‘ a “foreign” country without any objection
-from anybody provided you did not behave in .a

manner intolerable to your fellow man.

Broader Scope . . .

A New Major .       I  

By Kathy Maser

There are a few ‘of us around here wholare Eng-.

lish majors, some because we are by nature weak
and full of vague’ Abstract 'Ideals, impractical in
the worst way. Some of us have tried a few other
rather interesting_ things and still found ourselves
pulled irresistably toward print-
ed matter of_any kind.

And some of us are not with-
out certain unexplainable feel-
ings of guilt about it all, as wit-
nessed by the fact.‘ that, when
asked by a fellow student what
our major is, we involuntarily
blush and respond in vague
mumbles. “Well . . . er .,. . ah
. . . I’m not really sure yet, but
I...ah...guessitwillbe
English.”

The truth is that some of us are English lit-
erature majors only because that is the only kind
of literature major there is here—and almost any-
where else, for that matter. And upon close exam-
ination we ﬁnd‘that these nasty guilt feelings stem
from genuine embarrassment for course initiators
who have feelingsof Anglo-Saxon superiority—
literary apartheid, mercy me!

All right—why not a major in comparative lit-
erature, or world literature, or any other name
you care to give it? I can think of several rea-
sons favoring it which are, however, based on
logic, a precarious foundation at best. ‘

A student who studies history studies history——
not just American or English history, but also
Asian, Russian, Latin American, European, and so
on. History departments don’t seem to feel that
they are spreading themselves too thin; on the
contrary, this has been common practice for’ years._
Specialization in any particular area of history is

then left. to the student. He has a choice. There is

again in terms of practical internationalism.

This is certainly the only country in which this
is possible since, with the exception of" a few sur-
viving Indians, we are living today in the United
States of Europe which is only geographically the
United States of America. That is why I am rather
against any “nationality group”, which tries to iso-
late itself or to pretend that it alone has the key to
civilization.

South to Lose - /so,

At this ‘point, some Negro among my readers
is going to take offense that I have included him
in the United States of Europe. He is wrong. From
time immemorial freed slaves have taken the na-
tionality of their former masters. Moreover,‘ such.
freedom as the Negro enjoys in any part of the
‘world has come from the introduction of tAmeri-
can, or European, ideals in place of the former ’
local customs. .

That is why, of course, the southern states are
going’ to lose out in their attempt to‘ segregate the
Negro as something “different.” He is just as much
a part of our contemporary culture as is the Min-
nesota “Scandinavian,” the Pennsylvania ‘‘Dutch- 
man,” or th New'“England'er.”

The acceptance of “Internationalism,’ therefore,

 

‘ is no more than the acceptance of the belief that

you should let your neighbor go his own way pro-

-3

antly, the realization that if his conduct does
cause offense, it is because of somethinginherent
in him and not because of the accident of birth

  
  

Opportunity for Internotionalism . 
The horrible travesty of justice known as “guilt .
by association” has never been more startlingly
displayed than in the condemnation of all French-
men, because of Napoleon, of all Germans because

‘ of Hitler, or of all Russians because of a succes-

sion of brutal leaders from Ivan the Terrible. to. ‘

..The study of mathematics" requires‘ learning, al- , 
most everything known of- mathematics‘. It ispa ‘ ’ 

vcumulative effort, each succeeding course using in

some way everything which has been learned be-5
fore. So it is with English-literature,‘Which fﬁnds
its basis in many of the works of early European , _'
and Oriental writers. ’ ' _' I
To‘ my uninitiated and perh_aps naive view-
point, this seems to be rather easily accomplish-"
ed. Almost every one of our modern language de-A
partments offers somewhere between ﬁve and ten '
courses inthe literature of theiparticular language. '
This fact would attest to the ability of these profes- .
sors to’ teach the literature of these countries, and: ‘
although they are not taught in English, for the Y
purposes of comparative literature,arrangements '
could be made for similar courses in English; .‘ ,
The English department has at least recognized -

 

" the need for a more extensive l'iterary background. A‘ 

Within the academic year, three courses are of- ‘.
fered: European backgrounds to English Literature, ’ u.
Poetry ,(Eng. 127), and Modern European Fiction. ' ‘ l

» The surprising thing is that none of them are re-

quired for English majors; in fact, no one really
takes them -very seriously. Surely one more course , ,
could be added to the rather scanty list of required:-4? ' -
courses for English majors. ‘ “ ,
Thinking about a whole new. department in
literature is, at the present time, mere wishful
thinking. Perhaps it will come in‘ time, with the
planned expansion of our university or from the
inﬂuence of sophisticated, far-thinking, and there-.
fore, nervous faculty members. ‘
But until such time, some of us would be at least
partially appeased by the initiation of concentrat- <
ed, gutsy survey courses in, say, French, Russian,
Italian, and German literature—as well as sev-
eral in Oriental. As it is now, we ﬁnd much of "31
this literature turning up .only as suggested read?’

   Robert Brown Gives Ideas On

Modern Approach to Writing

By TRUDY WEISS
Robert M. Brown, a 1939 graduate of the University, re-
viewed his ﬁrst novel, “Brother, Which Drummer?” last
Wednesday in the Book Center.

Brown is vice-president

of the advertising ﬁrm of

"Ketchum, McLeod and Grove, Inc. In answering the ques-

tion, “Why do you write?” ‘Brown explained that all ad-

vertising men feel that they have
a good book in them. Brown said
that He had the desire to get that
book written and with this idea

- in mind he started on his novel.

“I had hoped to write a con-
ventionally slick, hopefully hum-
orous, witty book. But I discov-
ered, once you get started, you
don't tinker with art form; you
just write.”

Seeks Signiﬁcance
“A novel seizes you. Rather

‘ than you taking hold of the work,

it takes hold of you.”
The purpose of his writing is
the pursuit of signiﬁcance. In

' -fact, this was the working title

for the ﬁrst half of his .manu-
script. Brown said that he was'
searching for something signiﬁ-
cant: “All of us try" to ﬁnd some-
thing worthwhile to leave he-
hind for society,” he quoted
from John Steinbeck.

As a writer,,Brown feels that a
novel slfould get somewhere. “The
theme must appear,” he said, “not
complicated, and not in a nega-
tive way, but so that the reader
can ﬁnd it.”

' Themes Stand Out

 iv. A_ 7 Citing three books he chose at
 random from the shelves, Brown

-showed how the themes are ob-
vious in each of these novels:
“The Great Gatsby,” “The Heart
‘of the Matter,” and “Of Human
Bondage.”

“A novel does reflect life’s
moods,” he said, “and these are
seen in the overtones of the
themes.”

Brown said that a novelist must
have two.._qual~ities: he must have
the drive to work at his task,
and he must have a strong ego.
“Write about what you believe,
_and what you believe in, because
too many of us have too few be-
liefs.”

_ Quotes Oppenheimer

Brown _quoted this statement

.‘from an- address given by Dr."

Robert Oppenheimer at Columbia
University: “This is a world in
which each of us . . . will have
. to cling to what is close to him,
to what he knows, to ‘what he

" does, and to what he loves.”
He went on to‘ say that today,- ~

Tryout for Drama

E , Series Next Week‘

Tryouts for the Pitt Players TV
series on Juvenile Delinquency
will beheld Monday and Wednes-
day at 3 p.m. .in the I Zimmer
building.

At least ten men are needed

for the four short dramas that
will appear .on Channel 13. “They
"need have no previous acting ex-
perience,” says Mr. McHa1e, “but

" physical type is important. They

should be the West Side Story
type, and young inappearance,”
he added.

The Zimmer Building is op-
posite the Forbes Field box office.
Tryouts will be held in the Play-
ers’ room on the second floor.

in the after-work hours, we
frantically grab for time-con-
suming hobbies. This, .according
to Mr. Brown, leads to a state of
disinterest, and causes the com-
plete separation between the
business world and the after-
hours society.

In his future writings, Brown
intends to deal with the search
for a. way to bridge this ego, by
merging the two societies — the
business world and the after-
hours world.

Professor Peterson had said
that a novelist must be an inter-
esting man. To this, Mr. Brown
added that a man must be an in-
teresting man as well in order

"to write.

The author only touched on the
theme of his book. Instead of
telling, the story of his novel, he
gave the audience a better un-
derstanding of how the book was

written — of the amount of work

and searching for values that
went into the writing of his {ﬁrst
novel, “Brother, Which Drum-

' mer?”
