Head Committee
For Gun Control

Two University students are
leading a drive in the Pittsburgh
area to solicit petitions and let-
ters urging area Congressmen to
support gun control legislation.
Harry Tuminello, a senior politi-
cal science major, and Vic Pap-
pale, a senior speech major, have
organized an ad hoc committee in
response to an appeal by the Na-
tional Council for a Responsible
Firearms Policy to write letters
to congressmen.

The ad hoc committee has two
objectives — Campus solicitation
and a city-wide campaign. The
group hopes to gather 20,000 sig-
natures on a petition and send
them to Senators Clark and Scott
and Congressmen from the Pitts-
burgh area by June 20.

The petition says that 85 per
cent of the American people fa-
vor stricter gun legislation. Ac-
cordingly, the National Council
has called for the prohibition of
sales of all firearms and ammuni-
tion by mail, the prohibitivn of
the sale of firearms and ammu-
nition to all persons except those
possessing a permit to own a fire-
arm, and the establishment of fed-
eral guidelines setting criteria for
issuing permits. For example, the
Committee believes that minors.
criminals, and mentally disturbed
persons should not be permitted
to have firearms. The committee
also wants increased penalties for
violations of all firearms laws, in-
culding imprisonment as well as
fines.

Tuminello told The Pitt News
that his ad hoc committee was
organized Friday by about twen-
ty people. The committee collect-
ed several hundred signatures on
their petition on Friday during
one hour. Tuminello indicated
that the group hoped to make
more headway this week, when a
desk will be on the ground floor
of the Cathedral.

The National Council hopes
to obtain approximately ten mil-
lion signatures on its petitions.
Tuminello said that “Some of the
Congressmen who have been re-
acting to gun control legislation
have shifted their opinions. “Sen-
ators Philip Hart of Michigan.
Mike Mansfield of Montana, and
Pennsylvania’s Hugh Scott were
against federal gun control legis-
lation but have changed their
minds. “The purpose of our group
is to keep pressure on them.” said
Tuminello.

Besides soliciting signatures at
the Cathedral, the Pittsburgh com-
mittee has volunteers with pe-
titions asking for signatures on
city street corners. Tuminello said
that so far, local response to the
gun control drive has been good.
and that the committee expects to
obtain many signatures before
the June 20 deadline.

POLARIS

Due to Orientation, the Pol-
aris and the Owl will be on
sale in the towers lobby on Mon-
day, Tuesday and Wednesday,
from 11 to 1:30_p.m. and from
4 to 7 p.m. The yearbook ls Sfi.

is $1.50 if purchased seperately.

‘Case Looks Good’ --

“I get my mail delivered to
the Oakland Post Office." explain-
ed Mary Bufwack. University stu-
dent involved in a mail tampering
suit against the U. S. Postal Ser-
vice and the FBI “But my mail
has been tampered with before I
get there to pick it up."

Miss Bufwack refused to dis-
cuss possible reasons for the mail
tampering. “Anyway.” she protes-

_ ted." the merit of the case is sup-

posed to depend only on the open-
ing of the mail. not on the reasons

g behind it.”

“This orientation session is
the most promising, best—plan—
ned and most worthwhile ses-
sion we’ve ever had.” This
comment by Orientation Host
Steve Honeygosky shows the
enthusiasm typical of the entire
Undergraduate Orientation Com-
mittee. Dave Guydan, in charge
of the Hosts and Hostesses, calls
this years staff “the most enthusi-
astic in years.”

The Orientation Committee is
hoping that the changes they have
made will improve the Orienta-
tion program. Richard Ombres,
orientation chaNman, feels that
this year’s program is “serving
the needs of the freshman by real-
ly giving an orientation to the

University. In the years past, em-
phasis has been placed on testing
instead of on making the freshmen
feel at home.”

There will be only four orien-
tation sessions this summer. The
first session which started last
Sunday included over .400 fresh-

men. This is the smallest group
scheduled. By having much larg-
er groups each time, the Com-
mittee hopes to instill class spirit
in the freshmen.

The program will include the
showing of slides deplicting life
on the University campus. By
next year, the committee hopes to
have a movie available.

Fun Night, held at Trees Hall,
is modeled after Greek Week Fun
Night. The freshmen are divided
into teams headed by a host or
hostess. During these activities,
the freshmen will have a chance
to become better acquainted with
each other.

Foreign Students Judge U. S.

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

“The American people are
somewhat superficial,” said Mar-
garita Bonfante, a Columbian
student studying English here.
Her comment was in response to
a crossection survey taken of for-

eign students studying at the Uni-
versity. Some diverse, and sur-
prising, attitudes were revealed.

Soon Hwa Lee of Korea, an
art student. typified the American
people as being “very busy”.
However. a classmate. Schiko
Kishimoto, Japan. found them
“very kind people. very peaceful”.

Tulasi Joshi. a graduate student
in Geography considers Ameri-
cans “too individualistic. too ma-
terialistic. ”

When asked to compare the ed-
ucational systems of the Universi-
ty with that of their own coun-
tries, most foreign students said
that comparison was impossible
because the respective systems
are completely different. How-
ever, a few found advantages in
the U. S. way.

Mah Vash Aboozia, Iran. a grad-
uate student in Library Sciences.
was impressed that “teachers ac-
cept students as friends and keep

She was also mum on her cam-
pus activities. Although she admit-
ted to “Have worked with the
Students for Peace,” she felt
that her campus activities should
not “prejudice the case.”

According to Miss Bufwack,
the sum of $250,000 that she is
asking “is arbitary. The suit is
the important thing, not the sum.”

She would not offer an opinion
on the legal outcome of the case.
However. she did say that “the
case looks good. expecially if it

respect.” Joshi thought that “the
close contact and the complete
freedom to express one’s views to
the professor is wonderful.”

A Greek student studying Eng-
lish here believed that the rea-
son behind the superiority of the
American educational system lay
in “more money here for labs,
books, etc.”

Particia Bejarano of Columbia,
a student studying under the La-
tin American Scholarship Pro-
gram of American Universities, of-
fered a concrete improvement. She
proposed a “combination of the
two educational systems (Colum-
bia’s and the United States’)—-
with two years of college back-
ground and two years of special-
ization.”

A second question asked the
students about the difficulties
they encountered with American
social customs.

A student from one of the more
progressive countries of West Af-
rica met racial problems in his
search for housing. His reaction,
however. was surprising. He
found the situation “very inter-
esting.” These different experien-
ces make a man.

gets to a jury trial.” Although she
does not envision ony major pro-
blem with the suit. she pleads ig-
norance of the legal technicalities
involved.

While she “appreciates the
backing of the Pitt News.” Miss
Bufwack was reluctant to volun-
teer any information.

Her attorney, Ernest Nasser, ad-
vised that she say no more about
the case until something develops.
Indiscreet revelations “could pre-
’she feared.

 

 

Soon Hwa Lee was shocked at
seeing “boys and girls hand - in
hand all the time.” Elsy Paez, a
Latin American student in Eng-
lish, “didn't like it that men look
the same as women from the back.
I like real man.” S

It seemed to Joshi that “there
is too much fickleness between
man and woman in this country,
expecially among teenagers.”

Another criticism was offer-
ed by Miss Abooia. She was “sur—
prised to find the way people are
disrespectful to their parents and
those older.’’

Dorm life drew a round of com-
ment. Sachiko Kishimoto thought
that “the cafeterias are too noisy.
But the food is very good compar-
ed to Japanese food. ” Other stu-
dents, on the contrary, consipered
the food “Terribly bad.” Of spec-
ial infamy was the coffee served
at the University.

One female foreign student
“wished for cooking facilities. It’s
important for girls.” she said.

The Cathedral of Learning
was the object of varied remarks.
On the one hand, Pat Bejarano
thought the Cathedral “a terrible-
looking building. I prefer modern
buildings like Trees Hall.”

A Mexican student studying
English here agreed. “It’s too
dard and impractical,” he said,
“It causes a lot of problems in
changing classes. It’s more like a
museum than a school.”

On the other hand, the majority
of the foreign students described
the Cathedral in glowing terms.
“A beautiful building, a symbol
of international living and broth-
erhood", said one. “I’m amazed
at the styld,” said the Greek stu-
dent, “‘We have nothing like this
in Greece ' t’s a, nice bu ‘ .

College Frosh

You’re Just Beginning

By PAUL STOLLER, Editor

The challenge of college existence is a formidable one;
for university life challenges those parental concepts that have
been engrained in our minds. College is a time of change
and adjustment when each student attempts to find himself.
And for the naive college freshman, orientation is the first
test in a series of many self-examinations along the path to
self awareness.

The tenets of our society make college even more diffi-
cult. When freshman come to orienta-
tion, many of the students never have
had the chance to think for themselves.
They have been stifled and clutched by
the paternalistic tongs of our social
mores. This, it follows, creates a taxing
uncertainty that causes a great deal of
anxiety on the part’ of the incoming
freshman. For the first time in his
young somewhat sheltered life, the in-
coming freshman has to make a number
of decisions that may ultimately affect
STOLLER his future.

But the incoming freshman can not overlook his respon-
sibilities as a college student. And these tasks cover more
territory than merely being a bookwormish student. In the Uni-
versity community, the student is beginning to assume more
deversified role. He no longer is the beer guzzling lethargic

sole of the “silent generation.” He no longer accepts a soci-
ety where wanton violence and unjustified war are accepted
as being necessary for our national security. He rejects the
old style politican or administrator who thinks of him as son-
ny” or “young man.”

In short, the student of today demands and deserves the
respect of his elders. Television Commentator Hugh Downs
recently said that todays young generation has the best group
of minds that he has ever witnessed. Downes maintained that
today’s student is part of the best generation in the past 500
years. “They may save us yet.” said Downes.

But the student’s thoughts and the student’s actions are re-
jected by our “old style society” and consequently it is for the
“incoming freshmen” and the maturing sophomore and the ur-
ban upperclassmen to break out of his old crusty senseless
roles. It now time for the student to assert himself against
the stagnant odds of partemalism. It is essential, in fact, that
students break out of the hybernating drowsiness of compla-
cency. Believe it or nor, the student population of today is be-
ing listened to with the utmost seriousness.

The challenge of college life today is to get that which we
deserve. And we deserve a voice in the affairs of this society;
we deserve an active part in the decision making process. And
we shall be heard.

 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
   

Pitt News Review: ‘2001’

Kubrick Leaves Philosophizing Up to Viewers

By ROY JACOBS

The Right Answer -- Education

Life Just Isn’t Black And White

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

The Negro problem is not the burden of the
white man. The problem is too large for the white
man to handle. It is a problem for America.

With organizations, such as the Black Power
groups. the problem could be solved. These groups
are militant. and at times. they
threaten violence if they don’t
have their way. But they are just
like the unions (comprised mainly
of whites) who can bring stagna-
tion to society when they strike.

The Black Power “action
teams” say in theory that all Ne-
groes should push and jam a
wedge into the white. middle-
class orientated America. But in
reality. this is impossible.

For many Negroes, this jump
from the cellar to the second story
is a dream. They desire the material good. but they
have neverlearned to work their way up.

Hence, when the Black Power group says ‘Go!’
—they go; but they don’t know what to do. They
neither have the background, the adaptive edu-
cational grounds for beginning, nor the previous
opportunities to move upwards.

Then. there is the Negro middle-class. who are
those individuals who pushed themselves. On their
own, they earned the education to compete on the
open market with the white. Thdy grabbed at a
chance. a rung on the society-ladder. and they pul-
led themselves above the crowd.

The Black Power group also advocates the
“Black society.” This is a laugh. In the cities es-
pecially. the white and black are so enmeshed
that it is stupid and detrimental to divide the two
by two.

G. LIES

 

It is also in the cities where the “organization"
has poured gasoline to the riots’ fire. The “organi-
zation” has provided the outlet for young Negroes,
who feel they have nothing to look forward to ex-
cept more stench and squalor.

And if a person has nothing to lose. he doesn’t
care what he does. Life means little and death
would be a way out.

But what is the answer. the right answer’?

The Kerner report said “white racism” was
responsible for everything; the Negro’s plight.
the city’s riots. and the separation of society.

The report hit the nail on the head. but it
used a shoe and not a hammer to do it.

What is wrong with the white and what is
wrong with the Negro is the same thing-—Educa-
tion. Whites know little, or nothing about the his-
tory of the Negro; and many seldom come in con-
tact with the Negro. Whites who live in the suburbs
shake their moralistic minds and say, “It’s terrible
.. . . these riots. It’s a shame.” But the riots haven’t
affected them . . . yet.

And on the other side. the Negroes. who will
fight for themselves in life, say they don’t want
anything given to them. But it is only thinking rea-
listically to allow them the opportunity to advance.

An education, a job, a family, and a home is
not too much for any man to ask. But all four are
responsibilities and obligations. And life is some-
thing one doesn’t quit once he’s been given a
chance . . .even a second chance.

Responsibility is not taught in the homes of
many Negroes, because an example is needed to
teach a child.

And what can a 15-year old youth learn from
a father who comes home drunk or is never home.
and from a mother who is out all night.

He can’t learn responsibility, that’s certain.
But he can learn something else.

Write Congress
For Gun Law

Editor,The Pitt News

Senator J. D. Tydings (D. Md.)
pointed outthe desperate need for
gun control legislation during his
recent appearance on Meet the
Press. He cited, on a regional
basis, how the murdering of po-
licemen is highly correlated with
the absence of gun control.

He also indicated the role of
the National Rifle Association as
a lobby for munitions and arma-
ment manufacturers. The effect-
iveness of this lobby, it seems,
is a function of letter writing
campaigns undertaken by mem-
bers of the Association.

To counteract the Association’s
present campaign, Tydings called
upon the vast majority of Ameri-
cans who favor gun control legis-
lation, to write to their congress-
men expressing this sentiment.

‘Where the present anti—crime
bill has several regretable provi-
sions. we might, nevertheless,

It is doubtful if even five per-

deed, it took me at least two days
to determine whether or not I en-

stance of, 2001  most likely go

over the heads of many of its
viewers.

Many questions have already
been raised about the substance
of 2001. Nobody, apparently in-
cluding Kubrick and Clarke,
know exactly what it means. Peo-
ple have seen Christ images and
Hitler images. Because of its ob-
scurity, the film is destined to be
controversial.

To me, there is no real mean-
ing to the film. That is, there is
no onemeaning to the film. 2001
will mean something different to
each and every viewer. To some,
for instance, the black slab that
is the the subject of most of the
picture is some form of life from
another planet, another glaxy, an-

other uriiverse. But in -a ‘larger

sense, the slab can be God. The
fact that the symbol is a black
slab means that it conceals the
very nature of God. And the
search for the origin of the slab,
like the building of the Tower
of Babel, shows that man cannot
find the true nature of God while
he is alive.

But, as I said, that is just one
way to view the movie. My date
and I derived four or five other
interpretations in a half hour’s
time. For someone else, they
might be all wrong. But one thing
was clear to us. For all the tre-
mendous special effects, Kub-

rick’s technical spectacular was

dominated by his artistic achieve-
ment.

want to support it because of its
gun control features. We might.
however, want to support a more
carefully studied and far reach-
ing act including provisions on
hand guns and ammunition.

In any event. let us write to
our congressmen now.

Reflections

By ROY JACOBS

 

Is Richey’s Dream Impossible?

Sports Editor

It was a typical Jerry Richey story. New
school record. Qualifies for the Olympic
Trials. Coach Jim Banner was dissatisfied.

Richey ran fifth in the finals of the NCCA
1500 meter run, Saturday. He ran the distance
in 3:42.4, the third time he’s lowered his
own school record. The first six finishers qual-
ified for the Olympic Trials in two weeks. but
Banner was still unhappy. He thought Richey
could have finished third. Jerry wasn’t so sure
he agrees.

“I was pretty happy to get in the top six,”
he remarked. “I was only back 10 yards until
the gun (last) lap, but I was pretty well
done in by the finish.”

The race was won in record time by Dave
Patrick of Villanova, nearly three seconds fas-
ter than Richey. Jerry admitted that he wasn’t
sure if he could cut much more than a second
off of his own time. This would hint at a prob-
lem which might keep Richey from realizing
his Olympic dream this Olympic Year.

As of now, there are four 1500 meter men
that are better than Richey. Next week’s AA
U’s may turn up a couple more. And Jim
Ryun, the world’s best at the distance, isn’t
even competing now due to illness.

There are three spots on the Olympic team.
Ryun is virtually assured of one. That leaves
two spots, and Partick is an odds-on favorite for
one of those. In other Words, Richey is going
against six or seven others for one spot. He
could win it, but the odds are against it.

On the other hand, Richey admitted last
week that he’s beaten the fellow who finished
second to Gerry Lindgren in the NCAA 10,

000 meters. in his only meeting head-on with
Lindgren, Richey made a favorable showing,
considering his relative inexperience. The
logical reasoning is that Richey stands a better
chance of making the Olympic team in the
10,000 meter event.

However, there are two other considera-
tions. One, Richey detests long races, and the
10,000 is better than six miles long. Two, Rich-
ey is hungry. And hunger anddetermination
can make up for a lot of inexperience. Besides,
the 1500 meters is still the glamour event of
track. Nobody watches those guys running six
miles.

Well, Richey and Bryant Salter are staying
in California for the AAU’s this Thursday and
Friday. Salter is switching to the tripple jump,
hopeful of qualifying in that event. The win-
ning distance in the NCAA’s was 53-1-1/4. Sal-
ter hasn’t yet cleared 50, but he stands a good
chance of qualifying for the Trials.

Richey said that he is planning to run the
1500 again to gain some extra experience. Pat-
rick and Dave Wilborn of Oregon, the second
place finisher in the NCAA’s, won’t be there,
and the field of runners might not be quite
as strong.

Perhaps a win in the AAU 1500 meters
would be just what Richey needs to boost his
confidence and his performance for the Oly-
mpic Trials. But if he ran the 10,000 meters
and qualified in the AAU’s then next week he’d
have a choice when-he got to the Trials.

It’s Richey’s and Banner’s decision to make,
but the feeling here is that Richey’s dream
would become more real if he’d approach it
from two directions.

major league scouts. That year,
the All-America posted a 6-1 won-
lost mark, and compiled an unbe-
liveable ERA of 0.32.

This year, Welty’s ERA rose.
He never expected to duplicate
his incredible year that earned
him All-America status, but then
again, he never expected his E-
RA to jump as high as 2.89.

Regardless of a disappointing
season, many scouts still expres-
sed interest in the hard-throwing
left-hander. And so Welty was
confident that he would still get
his chance to make it in the big
leagues.

“The lousy thing about this

Welty, “is that they kept lead-
ing me on. A couple of scouts
kept talking to me after the sea-
son, but I was never chosen.”

Career in Doubt

C0 RRECTION

One name was inadvertantly
omitted . from Friday’s list of
freshman football recruits. He
is Larry Chesla, a 6-3, 210
pound tackle from Shenandoah,
Pa. Because of the omission of
his name, the heights and wei-
ghts of the other names one
name lower than they should
be. Also, James Wildonger
should be listed at 6-2, 200
pounds.

YOUR MILITARY OBLIGATION

Every able young American man, upon reaching 181‘/2
years of age, has an obligation to share in the defense
of our country. While you have no control over the
amount of time you must serve, you can control the
manner in which you serve. The purpose of this chart
is to show alternative ways of entering military ser-
vice, the obligation incurred under each, and the man-
ner in which your obligation is satisfied.
