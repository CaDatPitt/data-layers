Another uclminisiraiori quits

Senior Vice
Chancellor the
latest to resign

By Joe Wright
News Editor

One more remnant of the J. Dennis
O’Connor administration is gone, follow-
ing an announcement yesterday that
Senior Vice Chancellor for Business and
Finance Ben Tuchi is resigning that post,
effective immediately.

With the resignation, Tuchi becomes
one more in a long line of Pitt administra-
tors to leave since O’Connor announced
his own resignation on April 10, 1995.

Interim Chancellor Mark Nordenberg

accepted Tuchi’s resignation, thanking
him for his efforts on behalf of the uni-
versity. ! .

“Shortly after arriving. on the Pitt cam-
pus, Dr. Tuchi pledged that he would
work tirelessly to make our business and
finance unit one of the best in American
higher education,” Nordenberg said in a
written statement. “He has honored that
pledge through his efforts, and achieving
that level of quality will remain our
goal.”

But Tuchi’s resignation has also
sparked a shake—up in the Office of
Business and Finance. Assistant Interim
Chancellor Jerry Cochran will serve as
interim vice chancellor for business,
while Associate Vice Chancellor for
Budget and Administration Arthur
Ramicone will serve as interim vice
chancellor for finance.

“The uncoupling of business and
finance, at least for the short term, is

deliberate,” Nordenberg said. “That sepa-
ration should facilitate a study of both
structure and staffing in these areas,
which will be undertaken in the weeks
ahead as part of a more general review of
the university organization.”

.Cochran’s responsibilities will be for
the business, computing and information
services, facilities management and
human resource functions. Ramicone will
have responsibility for budget and admin-
istration and the controller’s office.

“Anytime there’s a change like this, it
provides an opportunity to energize the
units involved,” Cochran said.

Tuchi said he will remain at Pitt as a
faculty member in the Katz School of
Business. .

Before joining Pitt, Tuchi served as
vice chancellor for business and finance
and chief financial officer for the
University of North Carolina at Chapel

Pin‘ freshman wins Pa. State Fair Queen competition

 

By Tracey Katz
For The Pitt News

Feather Thomas, an _l8-year-
old Pitt nursing student, won
the 1996 Pennsylvania State
Fair Queen title on Jan. 20 at
the Hershey Lodge and
Convention Center in
Harrisburg.

It was no surprise Feather
was selected from 44 girls to
be awarded the honor because
she is no stranger to the spot-
light.

In 1995, Feather took second
runner up in Butler’s Junior

"Miss contest and also received

the Presence and Composure
Award. The following year, she

won the World Beginning-

Two-Baton Championship.
While attending Knoch High
School in Butler County,
Feather was an honor student
and also a recipient of the
Knights of Knowledge Award.
She was a majorette in the
marching band, a feature
twirler her senior year and also
a student baton instructor.
Thomas was also a member of
the Ski, Spanish, Pep and
Senior Cabinet clubs, and a
student council representative.
Feather’s decision to enter
Butler’s Fair Queen contest
was a spur of the moment deci-
sion. “My grandmother found
out about the competition
when I was on vacation with
my family. I never thought I
would win, it was just some-

thing Ivdid for fun,” said‘

Thomas.

Before reaching the state
level, Feather was chosen from
11 girls to represent her county.
She then packed her bags and
was off to the state,competi-
tion. ' -
The contest lasted for two
days. Forty-four girls compet-
ed for the title and were judged
on their poise and appearance,
speeches and their essays and
interviews.

Thomas said getting pre-
pared for the competition was
an event in itself. It was a chal-
lenge both physically and men-
tally. Her first step was to lose
weight. “I had about three or

four months to lose the ‘fresh- «

man 15’ so I could fit into my
prom dress. It was so hard. I
never worried about what I ate
in high school, because I.was
always active.”

Also, Thomas says she is not
one to get all dolled up. “It
took a long time to get my hair
and make-up on. The stuff they
put on me was stage make-up
so we could be seen out in the
audience. All I wanted to do
was wash my face.”

Mentally, Feather told her-

self that this was just a compe--

tition. “I did it for fun and to
meet other people, and if I won
that would be a bonus. If I
didn’t win, I had a lot of fun
trying.”

Feather said the worst thing
about the competition was the
constant waiting for the next
event to happen. “When I was

waiting to have my interview ‘

with the judges, my hands

started to tingle. I was so ner-
vous.”

The judges cut from 44 to
five girls based upon speeches,
appearance and interviews.
“The judges look and speak to
so many girls that you have to
do something that sticks in
their minds,” said Thomas.

After the cuts, the five girls
who had advanced were taken
off stage and individually
brought back on to answer this
question: If you were named
Pennsylvania State Fair Queen,
what would you do to promote
the values of the fairs?

When choosing a winner,

judges looked for the girl who
got right to the heart of the
question and gave a clear
answer. That’s what Thomas
did. “When they announced
me as the winner, I covered my
face in shock,” she said. ‘
Thomas felt she won the
contest because in her answer
she gave the judges something
to remember, as opposed to
winning solely on her beauty.
Thomas didn’t feel that this
was like a beauty contest. She
saw it as a great confidence
builder, not degrading. “This
really brought out the best in
me. I did it because it was

great way to earn money for
school.”

Thomas said she won
because she showed the judges
she could keep cool under
pressure. “It wasn’t based on
just looks. I gave an honest
answer, and I didn’t ramble on
and on.” ‘

As the Pennsylvania State
Fair Queen, Feather received a
$1,000 ‘college scholarship.
She is expected to promote
fairs throughout the state this
year, and she will appear in
various parades. .

On Feb. 5, Feather began her
duties by meeting with the

state legislature. She will also

have the opportunity to be pre— 9

sented, on the floor, at a state
legislature meeting and give a
speech.

Even though Feather carries
these new responsibilities,
school is still her top priority.

“I’m not sure what type of I

nurse I want to be yet. I’ll have
to wait until I start clinical to
figure that out.”

As for more beauty pageants,
she says she might like to do it
again. “I don’t know if it’s
really for me, but if I do it
again I would do it to get
money for college.”

said. “Him and his girlfri_end let
their emotions get out of control,
and he got worked up when she
jumped from the car. He’s OK now,
but could have gotten himself into
a lot more trouble if he hadn’t
calmed down right way. Still, you
never know what’s going to happen
when someone runs out of a build-
ing screaming like that.”

The individual was not charged,
but a report was filed and if he
ever tries to get into a dormitory
illegally again, he will be arrested,
Gaus said.

From there, Gaus and I made a
patrol of South Oakland. The bars
were just letting out, and red—faced
students were clumsily making
their way back home.

“Two o’c1ock is when all the
[police] cars are out watching,”
Gaus said. “We’re mainly looking
for people in trouble. Some people
look at us when we drive by like
we’re going to hassle them. Really,
we’re here to make sure they get

home safely, and aren’t lying in a
gut=.er or getting into a fight.”
Gaus is one of the newest offi-
cers on the Pitt Police force. She
signed on in September and has
already witnessed some very dan-
gerous situ-
ations.

said. “Some of it surprises you,
and some of it doesn’t.”

As we were making our waypast
the Law School building, a call
came in that a fire alarm was going

nity house," we discovered the
source: a fire extinguisher had
been set off under one of the fra-
ternity brother’s doors.

A cloud of yellow dust filled the

air as the fire alarm continued to-

scream in our ears. A pile of the
yellow dust was caked’ around the
floor _of one of the rooms.

“This happens all the time,”
Hamilton shouted as we inspected

the room for signs of an actual _

fire. There was none. “These guys
get all wound up and start ‘setting
off extinguishers. Like a bunch of
clowns,” he said. “They think it’s
really funny.”

After the engineer left to shut off
the alarm, the three of us waited to
question the occupant of the room.
A few moments later, he returned
and claimed that he didn’t know
who set off the extinguishe_r but
was equally upset by it since he
was getting_ready for bed.

No one in the fraternity house
claimed that they knew who set the
extinguisher off. ' .

“Every time these guys pull one
of these [false] alarms they’re risk-
ing disaster for every man on that
fire truck,” Officer Hamilton said.
As Officer Gaus and I were leav-

ing, Hamilton went to talk to the .

fraternity brothers still lingering
outside their home. -
“I’m going to tell them that this
time'they’re okay. There’s no
fine,” Hamilton said. “But we’re

Officer Gausvand I
continued our patrol of
South Oakland, but every-
thing was quiet once
again. A little after 3:30
a.m. we assisted Zone 6
police in removing three
individuals from the “O”
on Forbes Avenue, who
refused to leave when the
establishment was clos-
ing. They left quietly and
without incident. ’

“It’s not bad some
nights,” Officer Hamilton
had said. He was right.
While there was no prob-
lem with the individuals
in he “O” that night, two
nights later there would
be a fight in that same

establishment which
would result in one per-
son’s death.

Officer Gaus said
that “you just never know
what’s going to happen.”
While that evening was a
relatively quiet one for
Officers Gaus and

Hamilton, anything is
possible the next night for _
the Pitt Police.

going to happen again.”

Sophomore Michael
Schwartz said the shooting
has caused him to wonder
about the safety of the uni-
versity. ’

“It disturbs me knowing

that a drive-by shooting‘

happened on campus,”
Schwartz said. “Even the
possibility that it could

‘happen again disturbs me.

That could very easily have
been a student who was
shot.”

The incident has prompt-
ed some individuals to feel

‘ that non-university related

individuals should be
restricted on campus. '

“The cops should crack
down on the types of peo-
ple causing these prob-
lems,” junior Travis
Cornell said. “It’s not Pitt
students shooting each
other. I think anyone who’s
been arrested for violent
crimes before, or who is
caught carrying guns,

The university has not
come forth with any offi-
cial statement but has con-
sistently encouraged stu-
dents to maintain safety
precautions while walking

_ the streets of Oakland.

Zachariah Blott, a sopho-

more living in Lothrop
Hall, said that the shooting
has caused him to be more
careful when walking at
night.

“[The shooting] is not
going to_affect my mean-
dering about campus,”
Blott said. “All it’s done is
make me want to get to
where I’m going faster.”

“I strongly urge students
to take advantage of all
safety facilities on cam-
pus,” Public Safety
Director Rick Boyd said in
a previous interview with
The Pitt News concerning
the Kevin Cecil shooting.

"Boyd suggested that stu-
dents use common sense,
take advantage of Van Call
and report any questionable
characters or strange or
violent activities they wit-
ness to the police.

“People don’t give them-
selves enough credit for the
built-in warning mecha-
nism we all have,” Boyd
said. “We don’t get many
calls from students who see
things of a suspicious
nature.”

Students can_call the Pitt
Police 24 hours a day at
621-4040 to report any sus-
picious persons. ’

  Death on the Docket

 
 

Cotlpﬁoml

‘ We’ve all heard the jokes about “Dr. Death” Jack Kevorkian and his
Deathmobile. A quick morbid chuckle, maybe a little smile, and the dead-
ly impact of the jokes is overlooked Unfortunately for many people, there

' is nothing at all funny about the debate over the right to die.

Far too many people lie in hospital beds around the country, waiting
until it ﬁnally just ends. Many of them aren’t even aware that they are
alive, since the only thing keeping them that way is a set of machines
which keeps their organs functioning. They have extensive brain damage,
and will never recover to a normally functioning state, but they are kept
alive through the miracles of modern science and the modem legal system.

Thanks to medical science, it is practically possible to sustain life indeﬁ-
nitely, though the person may be brain—dead And thanks to the legal sys-

S tem, it is practically possible to keep a person breathing even if they don’t

want it.

The issue in front of the Supreme Cotnt right now goes beyond whether
or not doctors should be able to help terminally ill patients commit suicide.
The Court is now being asked to decide whether or not vital life support
may be removed from a man who is conscious but cannot function at all
without the help of machines. A . V

Michael Martin cannot sit up, cannot eat, cannot even breathe without
help. He suffered extensive brain damage when his car was hit by a train,
and he is almost totally paralyzed. Before the accident, he had told his wife

9 (according to her) that he never wanted to be kept alive by machines. His

wife has sued in several courts to have life support removed, and to let her
husband die. The Michigan Supreme Court said no, since there was no
proof that he would have wanted that ,
  The standard for withdrawing life support is Clear evidence that the
patient wanted that The Supreme Court established this non-policy in
1990, when they allowed that patients have the right to refuse life-saving
treatment. But in the absence of a living will, how can a family provide
clear evidence of a comatose patient’s wishes? You can’t ask the patient,
you can only ask the family. _

The main problem with this non—policy is that the decision is largely left

. up to the judge hearing the case. Though judges are not supposed to let

personal opinion interfere with a ruling, the Supreme Court basically invit-

' ed all judges to do just that. A judge in favor of_a patient’s right to dieeould

take the word of one family member as “clear evidence,” while a judge
opposed to it could deny that an entire family’s testimony was insufﬁcient
proof. -
Now that the Marlins’ case is before the Supreme Court, there should be
a decisive ruling regarding the right to die. Since patients are allowed to
refuse treatment already, they should also have the right to die. Right now,
too much is left to the decision of the state and the courts. The patients and
their advocates are the only ones who should decide whether life support is
withdrawn

History is, traditionally, writ-
tenand recorded by the vic-
tors. The stories of the Saxon
invasion of England over 1,000
years ago come to us from the
Saxons, as the stories of World
War II come to us through the

Allies. The story told by the.

“loser” of a battle is quite dif-
ferent,'as you can see if you

have ever been south of.

Pennsylvania. It is a little
unsettling to hear of how the
Civil War was lost.

But the reason that aspect of
history is.so unsettling is
because I have lived in
Pennsylvania all my life. I was
taught that the War was won,
and that the “good” side pre-
vailed. I never thought about
the fact that because “We won”
someone else had to “lose.”

The same kind of history is _

taught regarding any conﬂict,
but typically only one side is
told. This‘ is the main problem
with studying history, but the
ﬂip side is even worse.
Proponents of Outcomes-
Based Education and revision-

ist history are currently attack-

ing" history texts with a
vengeance. If they have their
way, history will no longer be
what happened in the past, but
some bastardization of what
happened through a biased eye
of modern observers.

The solution offered by the
revisionists is more dangerous
than presently taught versions
of history. These historians
would prefer to see history
written only from the view of
the “oppressed,” utterly ignor-

. ing the view of the “oppres-

sor.” This is no better than the
present situation, since it also
shows only one side of the
story.

If you think this couldn’t be
the case, think about the. last
American history class you
took. The books written by the
revisionists are now centering

. around three major topics:

slavery, Native Americans and
women. There islittle or no
mention of why European set-

Don't let the past creep up on you

tlers came to this country, or
what they had to go through
when they first got here. The
version of history being pre-
sented today is that the
Europeans who came to
America were nothing but
murderous oppressors who
intentionally set out across the

ocean looking for something to ‘

destroy and some peopleto
kill. Revisionists would have
us believe that-anyone of
European ancestry should ﬂing

themselves off the nearest

bridge out of guilt. Meanwhile,
Native Americans are present-
ed as peace-loving victims
who did nothing wrong, ever.
The revisionists neglect to
mention the wars which wiped
out millions of Native
Americans before any
European ever set foot on .'the
‘continent. While the settlers
who came here from Europe
were certainly not saints, nei-
ther were the settlers who were
already here.
Americans did their share of
killing,-too. I certainly do not

' condone the genocidal wars

against Native Americans
which eventually took place at
thehands of Europeans, but I
do not think that Native
Americans can be presented as
innocent victims.

One aspect of history which
has been largely neglected

' until now is American slavery,

other than a few lines in basic
texts: “There were slaves, then
Abraham Lincoln freed them.”
That’s usually all you hear
unless you take an advanced
class in post—colonial
American history. However,
revisionists propose to teach
the history of slavery from an
equally ludicrous angle. They
would propose that slavery be
presented exactly like that,
including only a few lines
about ‘how everyone of
European ancestry should find
another bridge and ﬂing them-

Native.

selves off it again out of guilt.
To sum it up brieﬂy, the revi-
sionist version of history is
this: “Evil white male
Europeans came to America
and set about killing everyone
who was already here. Then
they oppressed women as a
hobby and then decided to buy
some slaves so they could
oppress them too.” 
According to the revision-

ists, that’s all you need to

know.

The point of studying history
is to learn from the past so that
things like slavery _or the
Salem witch trials are never
repeated. If such blatantly
skewed versions as the revi-
sionists present are the ones
taught, you will only ever
know that things happened. It
is more important, though, to
learn why things happened. If
you study Nazi Germany, it is
easier to understand how Hitler-

was able to brainwash an entire _

country. And if you understand

, that, it is easier to prevent it
from happening again. The ~

same theory applies to any part
of history you can think of.

The concept of only teaching
history from a Eurocentric
view is wrong. But the -revi-
sionist idea that we should
learn everything but European
history is just asridiculous.
The fact that Eurocentric histo-
ry has dominated texts for so
long is not a justifiable reason
to exclude-it from study in the
future. Other angles of history’
should be added to present
texts, but should not replace
them.

History should be studied to
learn both about the past and
from the past. The one thing
history should not be, though,
is one more method to promote
a political agenda in the class-
room.

American ancestry, and only

Keep your money where your mouth is - at home

ince the election of
1994, I have had the
pleasure of hearing
dozens of different criticisms
of the new Republican major-
ity in Congress. The most
outrageous of these attacks is
certainly the notion that giv-

ing power back to the states

would harm many groups of
people. Democrats argue that
if the federal government
gives block grants to states
for such things as Medicaid
and welfare, states will sim-
ply pocket this money or
spend it in other areas.
Apparently, state leaders
must be evil dictators who
never have to answer to their
constituents. So who do you
trust with your money more
— your home state or the
federal government?

The first advantage of
block grants is that they
would eliminate an entire
level of bureaucrats. The
more times funds pass
through the hands of govern-
ment workers at every level,
the less money -is left for the
intended recipients. This can
be easily seen. For instance,
our welfare system costs tax-
payers more than $300 billion
per year — but if the federal
government’ wrote checks
each year for $14,700 to all

attendance.

7.7 million poor families, it
would cost only $113 billion
per year. Certainly, the use of
block grants would be a huge
step in preventing such waste.

Another obvious advantage
of block grants is that they
give individuals a larger
voice in the way their tax dol-
lars are spent. At the national
level, each person’s opinion
is one of over 200 million
different opinions, but every
voter is much more inﬂuen-
tial at the state level. In addi-
tion, state officials are much
closer and more responsive to
people’s concerns. If voters
are determined to sustain cur-
rent levels of social spending,
then state governments will
respond accordingly.

The further tax dollars are
away from Washington D. C.,
the better they can be allot-
ted. In other words, my state
of Texas knows how to pro-
vide for Texans better than
lawmakers at the national
level. The city of Plano,
Texas can provide for its resi-
dents better than the state of
Texas can, and so forth.
Ultimately, each person has

time, and then give me a
block grant? I guess the fed-
eral government is much
smarter than I will ever be.
How did Americans ever let
so much of their power and

money get away? And why -

are liberals insisting that the
federal government should
continue to be the source of
provision for so many
Americans? Over the course
of the past 60 years or so, the
federal government has con-
structed a state of public
dependency. Franklin
R'oosevelt’s New Deal of the
1930s was the first big step
toward excessive govern-
ment. Social Security, for
instance, took away the
incentive to save money and
created a reliance on govern-
ment help during people’s
retirement years. Medicare

and Medicaid, both Great
Society programs, were seen
as wonderful forms assistance
for the needy. However, these
programs also have taken
power away from individuals
and local groups, as they
have created even greater lev-
els of dependence of the gov-
emment.

New federal government
programs usually are formed
during difficult economic
times and are seen as being
the best way to provide for
needy people. Once the tar-
geted groups begin to benefit
from these programs, they
view the assistance as a
“right” and will fight for its
continued existence. Thus,
big government has systemat-
ically broken the‘ arms and
legs of the American people
and forced them to beg for
mercy.

It is no coincidence that as
a greater reliance on the fed-
eral government has been
created, levels of net saving
in the United States have con-
sistently fallen. If we can turn
to Uncle Sam for aid whenev-
er we fall on hard times, then
why should we ever make
provisions for ourselves or
our families? The problem
Americans have had in reject-
ing an expanding federal gov-

At the Charles L. Cost Center, four members of the E

the Pitt Invitational, and all were halted there; in many I

   

shared the same fate — they reached the semis and »
folded. ‘

A satisfied Coach George Dieffenbach, who expected
tough competition and got it, said, “We played up_ to our
expectations. And we definitely developed our games.”

The most noteworthy development for Pitt was creat-
ed by 19-year-old sophomore Fran Davis — the
Panthers’ No. 1 seed, but unseeded in the tournament. -
After pounding Robert Morris’ Christine Ciufo, 6-0, 6- ‘
1, Davis battled and nearly beat Santi Nalluri, the over-
all No. 2 seed in the top singles division. The final was
7-6 (l3—l 1), 2-6, 6-4.

Davis simply ran out of steam.

“It was a long, tiring match. You can’t get much clos-
er than that,” Davis said.

Nalluri, a junior from Youngstown State University,
won the Pitt Invitational in 1994 and runner-up status
last year. This year, Nalluri fell to Duquesne’s Marianna
Gundin in the final.

The tournament attracted 55 women from four ,
schools besides Pitt, Robert Morris, YSU and Duquesne
— Bucknell, Fairfield, the University of New York at
Buffalo, and the University of Akron.

The tournament served as the opening for the second-
half of what has thus far been a season full of positives

last match was in October. . '

“It was a nice warmup for the matches we have com- V
ing up against Big East teams,” Dieffenbach said.

The other three Panthers who entered and lost inthe
semifinals were junior Tamara Kalesnik and seniors
Alison Baker and Marla Zielinski.

Taking first place in the beam,
junior Lori Buck continued her
successful series of placements
and tied for second place in the
uneven bars. Vaulting off a
spring board, Buck began her
routine by landing on the beam
in a split. The mount grabbed
the audience’s attention from
the first second of her routine.

Her streak continued through
the uneven bars where she tied
for second place with Senior.

“Lori’s bars have improved

But in the inner circles of the Pitt
wrestling team, such minor gaffes are

. beside the point, for every move Watson

makes on the mat is a mini-triumph. Andre
Watson is totally blind.

“Wrestling is just like life,” Watson said.
“Sometimes you have a lot of pain, but you
keep on going.” '

Watson knows all about pain. From the
age of 7 when he suffered a severe case of
pinkeye that caused his retina to detach
repeatedly, to the age of 11 when he went
blind, Watson has had to deal with more
than the average person. But like he said,
Watson kept on going, and now the Pitt
sophomore is a walk-on member of the
21st-ranked Panther wrestling team.

. Although Watson hasn’t _formally com-
peted this season, he recently went l-1 in
the team’s wrestle—off, making him Pitt’s

, second-stringer at his 167-pound weight

class.

“Andre has decent skills,” Pitt Head
Coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “He doesn’t
always work against the tougher guys on
the team. When he does, he usually gets
knocked around.”

In the beginning of the season, Watson
wrestled at a Penn State preseason touma-

ment and lost both matches. But to Watson,
it’s not all about wins and losses. It’s about
setting goals and going after them.

“This is something I can look back on in
my older years and smile about '— be happy
that I really did it,” he said. “I think it will
help me remember that these are things I
can be thankful for. I know in the future
that a lot of things are possible, as far as
whatever my goals are.

“After this yearl will have a sense of vic-

tory even though I haven’t been_compet--

ing.”

Somebody once told Watson that when
life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.
The Philadelphia native has juiced that
statement for all it’s worth, and now, after
years of adjusting and some divine help,
Watson has the world in a half-nelson and
isn’t letting go until he has done everything
he wants to do.

“You have to make the best out of what
you got,” Watson said. “There’s no need to
complain about what you can’t do. I can’t
sit around feeling sorry for myself, or want
people to baby me, or wanting the easy way
out. That’s not goingto get me- anywhere.”

Wherever Watson wants to go, whether
it’s pursuing a psychology degree to help
counsel disadvantaged people, or simply
building on the 3.48 QPA he earned last
semester, he knows none of that would be
attainable if it weren’t for his religion.

Religion is a big part of Watson’s life.
“That’s what’s keeping me going now,” he
said. Almost every aspect of his life
revolves around it, in fact, he even ends his

l3Cll1l'i'leI'S struggle at Big East Champio

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer K

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —
Tradition was upheld at the

Big East Indoor Track and

Field Championships last
weekend. Pitt depended on its
old stand-by field events and
sprints, while traditional pow-
erhouses Georgetown and
Villanova did battle in the dis-
tance races. In the end, it was
the long runs that decided the
championship.

And it was the Hoyas who ,-

claimed that championship,
while Pitt finished in eighth
place.

Najuma Fletcher scored 42
of Pitt’s 88 points. She suc-

cessfully defended her triple

— jump championship with 43-1

1/2 and also won her third con-
secutive crown in the pen-
tathlon (4,169 points) and high
jump (6 feet) plus her third
Outstanding Field Performer
award. .

Fletcher broke the meet
record with her 6-foot high
jump, but her meet record long
jump of 20-9 1/4 was broken
by West Virginia’s Pat Itanyi,
who jumped 21-0 1/2.
Fletcher’s 20-5 3/4 gave her
second place.

Trecia Smith scored 23 of
Pitt’s points, finishing fourth in
the shot put, triple jump and
long jump and finishing behind
only Fletcher in the pentathlon.

Smith has performed well in
all of those events all season,
but rarely all in one weekend. .

During one of the few breaks
she had when she wasn’t
sleeping, Smith said, “I’m not
used to so many events in one
day.”

Smith and Fletcher propelled
Pitt into first place at the end
of the first day of competition.

“Trecia and Najuma really
threw their bodies on the
track,” said Pitt Head Coach
Steve Lewis. '

But while Pitt scored well in
the field events, it faltered in
the sprints. '

All of Pitt’s women were in
the semis in the 55-meter hur-
dles and the 55-meter dash.

Unfortunately, they needed to
reach the finals in order to
score any points.

In the hurdles, four Panthers
were placed in one semifinal
race. Of the eight people in
each of two races, four moved
on to the finals. Only one of
the four Panthers in the semis,
Fletcher, made it to the finals.

The same thing happened in
the 55. Three Panthers entered
the event, and all three
advanced to the semifinals, but
only one, Tonya Mullins, went
on to the finals.

That opened the door for
Georgetown, who dominated
the distance events. At least
three Hoyas scored in every
event from the 800 meters on
up, leading Georgetown to vic-
tory with l3l points. Pitt was
second with 88.

As for the men, Pitt was no

' longer a contender by the end

of the first day. Curtis
Anderson’s third-place finish
in the pentathlon provided
Pitt’s only six points on day
one and the only points in field
events for the men. '
The men fared a little bit «bet-
ter in the sprints. Anthony
Dorsett nearly won the 55
meters, losing out by so little
that even the much-ballyhooed

electronic timing system

couldn’t tell who won.
Syracuse’s Cory Ward was
awarded first place and Dorsett
second, both in 6.28 seconds.
Pitt’s Jay Jones came in sixth
in the event with 6.37.

In the 400 meters, Orrel

nships, finish eighth

by finishing second with a
time of 49.53 in his trial heat.
Tim Tyre actually ran faster,
49.48, but only finished fourth
in his heat, keeping him out of
the finals. Green went on to
finish fifth in the final with
49.28.

Before the meet, Lewis said,
“This meet will be complex. It
won’t be over until it’s over.”

It sure turned out complex,
but even after the races were
done, it wasn’t over.
Connecticut led Georgetown
by four and a half points going
into the last event, the 4 x 400
relay. -

Connecticut won the first
heat of the relay with a time of
3:19.53. The Huskies sat and
watched Georgetown finish
second in the second heat in
3:15.97. The Hoyas’ second-
place finish meant that
Connecticut needed to beat
two teams out of the six in the
second heat in order to win the
meet.'It did, and Connecticut
had apparently won the cham-
pionship by half a point, 131
1/2.to 131.

But after the race, Seton
Hall, the team that beat
Georgetown, was disqualified
for a lane violation. That

moved Georgetown into first _

place and Connecticut up to
fourth, and it gave the Hoyas
the championship by half a
point, 133 to 132 1/2. A
The controversial change
made no difference in Pitt’s

‘standing. The Panthers ‘still’

came in eighth place, well
behind with 41 points.

Buck had grown wings. A slip on the next
release almost ruined her concentration,
but she regained her composure to exe-

mounts.

The bars were the other slippery piece
of equipment in Trees Hall. A few
Rutgers gymnasts fell off the bars during
their release moves. Freshman Erika
Flamer also fell during her release, a
Geinger. The fall was F1amer’s only inter-
ruption in a focused evening.

When a gymnast falls, a seven-foot dis-
tance from the top bar to the mat, she has
30 seconds to catch her breath before she
restarts her routine. Flamer punched the

mat in frustration and immediately

resumed the program.
“I don’t hear anything,’ she said,
despite the fact that her teammates and

We are currently recruiting approximately
100 college freshmen and women between
the ages of 18 and 20 for participation in a

research study of successful -aging at the
University of Pittsburgh. Participants are
required to describe their medical history and,
to donate a 2.5 Tablespoon sample of blood.
An incentive payment of $20.00 will be made
to all participants who complete the study.

the crowd shouted encouragement
throughout the meet. She also finished
second on vault and second on beam to
tie for third in the all-around with a
Rutgers gymnast.

Flamer’s beam routine was marked by
the gymnast’s focus and deep
concentration. She joined Buck and
sophomore Joy McElhinny,’ who finished
third, to compensate for Michaelene
Myers’ absence.

“When someone is injured, I need to
step-in and take her place,” Flamer said.
Stepping in had been a topic for all the
freshmen" last week.

Yohman said she’s looking forward to
competing at 8th ranked Towson State
next Saturday.

“[This meet] was the leadership we
were looking for,” said Yohman. “Now
we have a chance to prove ourselves on
the road.”

both seeded No. 2 in their divi-

In doubles action, Pitt pro-
duced semifinalists in all three
doubles divisions.

Davis and Zielinski walloped
a team from Robert Morris, 6-
3-, 6-2, in the first round, then
lost in the semifinals to the No.
1 seeded team in the first divi-
-sion. '

In the second division, Baker
teamed with freshman Erin
Shalbrack for a 6-3, 6-0 victo-
ry in the first round. They then
fell to the No. 1 seeded team.

In the third division, fresh-
men Jen Bible and Courtney
Aronowsky — playing in their
first collegiate matches —

‘were defeated in the semis by

the top-seeded team from

Youngstown. The final score: 1

1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.

Meanwhile, during the week-
end, Dieffenbach found time to
show off Pitt’s tennis
facilities to eight possible
recruits.

“We’re going to lose three V

seniors to graduation,” he said.
“It’s going to be tough to
replace them.

“But if we can get some
good recruits, teamed with the
players we have returning, I
feel we have a very competi-
tive future.”

Watson

°From page 8
bless.” According to Watson‘, his investment in reli-
gion has paid off exponentially. ’

“My mom has always brought me up learning
about God,” he said. “But I think after I went blind,
my life has completely improved. Some people
might find that hard to understand, but being blind
has caused me to grow up some.”

Watson was forced to grow up quicker than any-
one expected- His eye problems began when he got
severe pinkeye. Then complications set in, so he had
the infection removed. Watson healed quickly, and
scar tissue developed behind his right eye. Because
he had scar tissue, his retina kept detaching. Every
time it was reattached by laser, cells were killed in
the eye. His eye problems then spread to his left eye.
“We really‘don’t know what caused it,” he said. This
went on for about four years, until his vision, once

I20/20, was gone.

-“The first thing I thought of was I wouldn’t be
able to play football,” Watson said. “I didn’t really
think of the other things.”

Watson said it helped that he was a child when he
went blind because he didn’t have any preconcep-
tions about what a blind person should be like.
Although it was a gradual adjustment, Watson said it
was just a matter of time to learn Braille, to figure
out what clothes to wear and simply to get around. ‘

When Watson got older, some people mentioned to
his family that he should try wrestling. So he asked
his high school coach if he could join the Central
High School wrestling team. His coach obliged, and
before he knew it, Watson was making waves in the
Philadelphia public league.

Like anything else, wrestling was a learning
process. Toibegin, it’s a simple touch start, and he
must always maintain contact. Once he mastered
that, it was just a matter of time before Watson
moved up to the varsity. Wrestling against all “see-
ing capable” opponents, Watson was named honor-
able mention in the Philadelphia public league as a
junior. As asenior, he went 9-1, which earned him
third~team all-public league and the Sportsman of
the Year. —

“High school was a lot of fun,” Watson said, smil-
ing. “This is ajob.”

Watson was referring tocollegiate wrestling, more
specifically, the grueling daily practices and the
everyday interactions with his teammates. At first,
Watson said his teammates didn’t know how to treat
him.

“I think sometimes the guys didn’t want to get too
close because they didn’t know what to say or they
didn’t want to offend him,” Stottlemyer said. ,

Now, Watson said that the guys treat him like any-
bodyelse, which is exactly what he wants. Just the

other week at the Bell Atlantic Scholar-Athlete. lun-
cheon, teammate Larry Sprecher told all the guys at
the tableinot to tell Watson where his piece of pie
was because he wanted it for himself. “He was
laughing about it,” Sprecher said. “He has a real
good personality. We kind of joke about him being
blind, but in a good sense. He gets along good with
everybody.”

In warmups before practice, Watson runs with his
right hand on a teammate’s shoulder. Then it gets a
tad bit trickier —— fireman carries. Watson slings his
partner over his shoulder and almost rams him into

the wall. When he puts him down, they laugh and

continue to run.

Watson said he’s not sure if he will try out again -

next year. He said he might get involved in some-
thing else, maybe a fraternity.

“Everybody has a purpose here,”_Watson_ said.
“And I_ think me joining wrestling is part of that pur-
pose because I love to wrestle. It’s not the main
thing, but it’s part of a bigger thing in store in the
future.

“Sometimes I might be a little sad because I can’t
see, that I may be missing out on certain things. But
it doesn’t bother me because spiritually. I-know I
won’t be blind forever. I feel this is for a reason. I
don’t know the full picture of it now, but I will
