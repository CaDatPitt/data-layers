iThe Office of Student Affairs
may find‘ itself taking a greater
hand in the administration of the

Intercultural House, an experi-_

mental inter-racial living project,
now in its third year at the Uni-
versity.

The Intercultural House has

A been funded primarily by the Ger-

trude Stein Foundation, with the
University providing full tuition
scholarships for members of the
House. '

According to Dr. Alfred Moye,
Dean of Student Affairs, the
House finds itself in financial
trouble and is appealing to the
University for help.

John Tyler, founder of the In-

tercultural House, described the
University's role as that of a “si-
‘ lent partner, not expressing spe-
‘/cific preferences.” I
“The House has shown itself to
have various advantages and the
University is willing to make a’
more long range commitment."
he said.

Even if University funds are i

not forthcoming, the House is not

in danger of folding, according to I

Tyler.

If the University decides to aid
the House, some structural
changes are likely to occur, ac-
cording to Moye.

“The University just can‘t pick
up the whole financial package.
but we should be able to get

INTERCULTURAI. HOUSE: Noidanger of folding.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council members lastsweek dis—_
played little enthusiasm for a re-
quest to reconsider credit for Re-
served Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) courses.

In the final minutes of Friday's

meeting the Council passed a mo-
tion by Michael Margolis. assis-
tant professor of political sci-
ence. "not to take the initiative to
bring the issue of ROTC to consi-
deration" at a later faculty meet-
ing. .
The Council agreed. however.
that if it received a petition sign-
ed by 40‘ faculty members ex-
pressing concern over ROTC. the
full faculty will vote on the issue.

“There is a feeling that the _con-
scription situation will change and

we may be moving to a volunteer-

army,” George Jeffery, professor
of crystallography noted. “When
we see what happens with the
draft laws, then it might be a
more opportune time to discuss
the issue.”

On Dec. 3..1968. the faculty abol-
ished credit for ROTC courses by
a vote of 106-84. Student enrolled
in ROTC prior to the faculty vote
continued to receive credit. but
those registering for ROTC after
Dec. 3. 1968. were denied credit
for the program.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

asked the Council. "If it would be
worthwhile for someone in the
FAS to actively explore some of
the (credit) alternatives for
ROTC?" ’

Recommending that the Council‘

“wait until there is a substantial "

amount of faculty interest to bring
the issue to consideration,” David
Montgomery, associate professor

of history, asserted, “the .Univer- _

sity would be better off without
ROTC‘at all.”

ROTC has been completely re-
moved from some Ivy League
campuses. '

ACWO OBJECTS

Rosenberg read a memo from
the Advisory Council on Womens
Opportunities expressing disap-
proval of the Council's recent de-
cision to assign greater priority
to the Freshman Studies program
than to the development of Wom-
en's Studies.

He suggested that faculty ap-
pointments for the Women’s
Studies program be delayed
“pending clearance of the total
FAS budget. '-

"The Freshman proposal. for
whatever claims it makes on the
budget has been interpreted asthe
main priority of this faculty."
Rosenberg said. ' ‘

The funding of four team-taught
courses in the existing Urban
Studies program won endorse-

 ro rai

around the problem ‘by other
means.'.' he said.. -

One tentative proposal would
have the, University leasing the

House with the Gertrude Stein,

Foundation offering as much sup-
port as possible.

Under this type of system, the
House would no longer be able to
offer free room, board and tuition
to members. Scholarships would
be based on demonstrated finan-

"cial need.

’Other changes. are also being

considered.

One plan would expand the con-
,cept of the Intercultural House to
include women.

Tyler stated that the original
plans for the House included ideas
for a co-ed facility, but the physi-
cal set~up of the House and other
problems made such an idea dif-
ficult to realize. '

"The co-ed question was large-
ly a policy council concern even
befor.e the House opened, but we
were interested in the inter-racial
aspect, and so many people felt
that the whole project would not
work, we didn't want to bite off
more than we could chew," Tyler
explained.

Moye has arranged a meeting

‘ for Thursday at which ‘a proposal

will be drafted and sent to Tyler.’

“The University is looking into
the situation ‘to see just whereit,

can. get involved.“ Moye said.’

"The University. feels that the
Inter-cultural House experience is‘
’a' good one and should be contin-

'ued."

baffle campus police?

by RICK EULER \ _ b
Campus police have been baffled recently by a series of robberiesii 
in the»men’s locker room at Trees Hall. _  .
According to Joseph Gil, superintendent of Campus Security. four!» 
lockers were broken into last Thursday, and; while other nights have
not been quite so active.. the break-ins have been a regular occurrence. 
Gil said that the break‘-ins started suddenly about two weeks ago
and have been continuing regularly ever since. 4 j  
“We’re still trying to get a handle on the situation,” Gil comment- A’ '
ed, “We’re looking for some sort of lead. But it’s hard to get one when‘: __
you readily have outside groups coming into the building. V . , :;

Walt McCullough, an equipment roomattendant at Trees Hall-. said i

that the break-ins seem to occur regularly each term with the arrival
of intramural season. 

“We can't do anything about, it,”* McCullough added. “Even if we_‘

 

 

see a suspect, we legally have no right to grab him.” , .
Bill Conner, McCullough‘s co-worker," said that students them-‘ ‘

, selves couldprobably provide the best solutionto the problem by not‘
bringing their valuables with them. ‘

"I know it’s an inconvenience to returnrto your room ‘before com.-

ing to the gym, but you‘re better off leaving your valuables there and
not taking chancesj’ Connor advised. He added that students»should,_"
also lock their lockers when showering, since this is when many rob-
beries take place. 4 ’ '

Joe Bartolick, pool attendent, added that Trees Hall attendants

cannot check items for those using the gym. ‘

"There are just too many people using the facilities,” he, exp-lain- .  ’ ‘

So far, wallets have been the primary interest of those responsi

Gil added that about half of the wallets stolen have been recoveredjf

with only the money-missing.

Bogus tickets sold for the cancelled Isaac Hayes concert appar-
ently have bilked an as yet undetermined number of patrons.

According to Bill Markus. Director of Student Activities. the
counterfeit ducats were noticed Monday morning among those re-
turned for the $3 refund.

The phonies differ from the genuine tickets. in either of two
ways: variations are printed on a slightly rougher stock. or employ
a type face unlike the originals.

Though later arrivals presenting the bogus tickets were refus-

ed refunds. and names and addresses were taken down. Markus noted _

that none would divulge the source of the purchase.

At least eight forgeries have been encountered thus far.

"It's a pretty good job." admitted Markus. explaining that a
reasonably careful inspection is required to notice the differ-.
ences.

-Markus added that there is "no way ofiknowing how many il-
legal tickets were sold.“ since only about one third of official sales
have been returned.

Refunds for bona-fide tickets will continue through Friday at
the Student Union Ticket Office.

Markus suggested that the limiting of the number ofﬁplaces
where tickets are available could decrease the likelihood of the repl-
tition of the incident.

He, said that some sort of investigation will have to be effected. -

but until then about the only recource is to submit returns to close
scrutiny. 2 '

ACCTS. WELCOME

After a flurry of student surveys. the boiling
debate over the Szabo Food Service has cooled to
a simmering point.

An informal survey conducted by the Pitt \lews

revealed that irate students are waiting for action '

to be taken. Despite the hammering the food ser-
vice has receivedgin the _past week by the surveys.
the majority of students questioned feel that no
radical changes have come about.

But. many students said, the food has not be-
come worse. One student. very obviously a Politi-
cal Science major. said: "If all the surveys do is
scare Sazbo into trying ‘a little harder. they’re
worth it. I see the whole thing as a small cold
war. ..

He compared the food service’s frozen aspara-
gus and students’ petitions as a “balance of terror.”

Another student said that while Szabo hasn't
improved enormously, it is not going downhill.

"It’s been okay recently.” she said. “but all I
need is one really lousy meal and I’ll be angry all
over again."_ '

Meanwhile. the signaturels-gathered‘ in a formal
campus—wide petition by Tower B Resident Assist-
ants are destined to become part of a letter to be

sent tovarious officials and organizations. Alice
Calabria, senior R. A. of Tower B. said that all
forms have not yet been returned. ’

The statistics, comments, and surveys gathered
by Women’s Housing Board will also be mailed
to officials to demonstrate student dissatisfaction

' with the service.

The Boarding Food Service Sub-Committeep

one of the organizations slated to receive both
surveys. has been meeting regularly to discuss

Szabo Food. Donovan Hughes. Assistant Director '

of Housing, said that he would like to conduct
two broad surveys prior to the 90-day effective
clause of the Szabo contract.

At a Feb. 12 meeting. though, Hughes warned
that too many surveys might induce student apathy.
He also stated that he has no objection to surveys
provided they are not just large masses of irrele-
vant statistics. .

Another topic of discussion at the meeting was
the meal plan options. Hughes suggested that a

three-member representative group of two students ' I

and one administrator visit various colleges to
collect pertinent information. These comparisons.
he said,‘ wouldvaid the committees when contract
negotiations occurred.

Spock motivated I

by higher law’

by LOIS LEVINSON

Dr. Spock is busy tuning stu-
dents in to the different drum-
ming of the People's Party.

For a long time, the People's
Party’s presidential candidate
said, he marched in time with
quasi-liberals until he became co-
chairman of ‘the National Com-
mittee for a Sane Nuclear Policy
in 1963.

“I was right behind our govern-
ment's nuclear armament policy,”

Spock said, _“and voted for Ken- ‘
- nedy in 1960 because be pro-

mised to fill the missile gap.”

SPOCK
Morally on the ball

“Then I found that the gap
was nonexistent and that the

government was ignoringthe ef- .

fects nuclear fallout was having
on babies.”

Spock voted for Lyndon ‘John-
son in 1964 because he was the
anti-escalation candidate. Once
again Spock lost faith.

"In February of 1965 Johson
did what he wasn’t supposed to
do—he started the bombing of
Vietnam,” he said.

"01/vl’ scope

The 1972 Owl will be more

according to its Editor Paul
Salva.

-Of the yearbooks 600 pages

Becoming co-chairman of the
National Conference for New

.P_olitics in 1967, Spock claimed

he “made a call to the public
to resist illegal authority.”

"We wanted to belatedly make a
stand behind the young men who
refused to serve in an illegal
war,” he added.

Although, according to Spock,
the only kind of help he and his
supporters gave draft resisters
was monetary, he was convicted
in 1968 on charges of conspiring
to counsel evasion of the draft
and sentenced to" two years in
prison. An appeals court later
overturned the conviction.

Spock assigns civil disobedience
of the kind be practiced a
permanent place in our society
when “government is unjust.”

“How far you go,” he continu-I
ed, “depends on how bad the in-
justice is. If violence was ever
used against me I would be forc-
ed to respond in kind.”

Spock claimed he never thought .

he was working against the law.

"There is a higher law that I
obeyed." he stated. “American
law is only technical and hasn't
caught up with itself.

"My country was saying I was

. in the wrong and my conscience

told me I was more on the ball

, morally than ever before.“

Young people, in Spock’s view,
are the most morally motivated
people in this country today.

"They are the most disgusted
with what’s going on, but they
are ‘also the most cynical and
that can prove self-defeating. We
are trying to offer them a choice
so that they won’t feel they have
to waste their vote :on the two
existing parties built up from the
exact same planks.“-

Dr. Joseph Hinchliffe,D_irector of I-fealth Ser-

students required by Strothman and Mock is $57

In terms of benefits,‘ “both plans have merits
and are better in many respects than any other
plans available,” said Hinchliffe.‘

Both Raymond Strothman and Leland Deck,

Ma0’s movies mark
  Nixon’s China diary

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor .

arrived in China
(-the other one) today. You can imagine
my excitement when. stepping off the
plane. Premier Joe En Lai rushed up
‘to, shake my hand. It_ was quite an ex-
perience, diary, one I’ll not soon forget.

But that was nothing compared to

 what happened as we walked to the car!
7 This'man,»who was a dead ringer" for

Sidney Toler, came up to shake my
hand, or so I thought. But was I sur-

_'prised when he pulled out a knife and

leaped at me. ’

Fortunately, - one of Joe's friends
kept his wits about him and jumped on

poor Sidney and we were able to sub-

due him. Of course, I thanked my res-
cuer profusely, even invited him down
to,_Bebe’s for a weekend, but he wouldn’t

A hear of it.

Sunday dinner- I am learning mo_re
and more about this strange land. ‘The
Chinese, it seems, have this quaint cus-
tom that if “a man saves your life, he
is forever after responsible for it. So
now, my rescuer, whose name'is Li,
follows me everywhere I go, looking

'-outfor me. . '
It’s quite a charming custom. really.

though it sometimes gets a little crowd-

he just smiled that inscrutable little
smile of his and said we wouldn't want
you to come to any harm in our country

' haha.

Monday lunch-Oh oh. I was afraid
this was going to happen. Bill Buckley

is making an, absolute fool of himself.
‘At lunch today he went around to all

the tables and snooped under them for
hidden assassins. Then he insisted on
tasting all my food to make sure it was

okay. Li, stalwart that he is, kicked poor ’

Bill a good one to the shins. Bill was
pretty uptight about that, and for a while

‘it was pretty tense. But as usual, Joe

saved the day.

Smiling that little smile, he said
Bill's leg was really badly
hurt, they would wrap it in a Singapore
sling haha. We all ‘had a good laugh

over that one.

Monday night-Met Mao Tse Tung
tonight-he is the spitting image of War-
ner Oland. But I'll say this-he is one

‘ hard bargainer. He asked me straight out

ifl,I wouldn‘t like to forget about Queui-

.oy and Matsu and I told him not on his

last fortune cookie. Things were a little
as usual, Joe saved the
day. He suggested we watch some home
movies of the Long March. Mao was
only two happy to oblige, and we spent
an enjoyable evening watching flicks.

Tuesday morning-Up bright and ,-ear-
ly, but not_ as earlyas Li. I found the
energetic devil putting a new light

bulb in our chandelier. He is too good
tous. '

Pat. though, is having a miserable
time. The water here just doesn‘t agree
with her.‘ Over breakfast today" she got
that green look of hers and bolted from
‘the table. I apologized to Joe. who smil-
ed .as always and said now we knew
what they meant by the Chinese water
‘ torture hehheh.

Tuesday lunch-Bill Buckley is at it
again; Joe asked us if we wished to
tour Canton and Bill said sure and would
we get to see the Hall" of Fame. Joe, _.
of course, was unruffled, but I was really
embarrassed. ‘

Tuesday dinner- I'm afraid. diary.

. that I was not very statesmanlike at din-
ner today, but there was so much per-‘
functory toasting. and you know how
that Chinese food, doesn’t stick to you‘?
Well, anyway, I got a little tight.

I don‘t remember much of what I
‘said, except some horrible remark about
laundries. Joe,‘ of course, was~not in-
sulted. He said they had rather ex-
pected me. to “Taiwan on haha." "Whew!
I'm glad I didii’t blow it there.

Wednesday morning-Li up early
again. arranging our fruit bowl. He's
such a pleasant fellow,‘ talking to him-
self as he works. I'll miss him.’

Noticed that Bill. Buckley hadn’t
come down ‘for breakfast and asked
Joe where he was. Joe sa-id Bill hadn’t
been feeling well and was going to be

— treated. by, acupuncture. Leave it to
— Bill. He just couldn’t stomach Scotty
Reston scooping him.

Thursday afternoon-Took a tour of a
collective farm. ,It was quite instruc-
tive. Joe let us have a turn at the water
wheel and then we’ joined the peasants
for lunch.

Joe. as always. was,the life ‘of the

. party. Pat asked him if the b-ig ditch

‘ along the farm was for irrigation. Joe

smiled and said that was where they

buried the missionaries. I thought

that really clever.. but Pat just got green
again and excused himself. . *~

Thursday ‘night-Well. the miracles of
Chinese culture .never cease to amaze
me. Saw Bill Buckley today and he
was as docilevas I’ve ever seen him. Ex-
cept for, these black and purplish marks
on his forehead. he‘seemed completely
unconcerned. Even when Li accidentally
spilled» soup on him at dinner, he only
smiled politely. Joe, though. was not sur-.
prised. — "

Friday-Well, all good things must
end, and this trip‘ is no exception. As
we drove to the airport, -I felt said to
be leaving this exotic land. Joe, though,

ed cheer me up. As we were board-
ﬁthe plane, he. presented me with the
$est dog, a tiny brown _thing, and
suggested with a wink that I call _him
Chinese Checkers hehheh. What a pal. '

. Joie de vivre propels

frothy French frau i

by VIRGINIA COOK
Foreign Correspondent

If I didn‘t know she was as Norman as William the Conqueror.
I'd swear she had a little Irish leprechaun in her blood. Her grem-
lin laugh doesn’t come just from her throat; but bubbles up into
her eyes, out over the wrinkles that give a certain Norman texture
to her face, all the way across the table or‘ the room to you.

- She is as French as her accent, as vivacious as the bubbles in
the wine on the fantastic table she sets, and as impressive as her
name: Madame Pierre Mura. She leads what Frenchmen call “Le
Bonheur”, that is, the good life, and she‘ has a ‘balance between home
andbusiness, family and friendsithat few American women have and

. many would envy.

My French “mother" is gifted with an enormous energy that
begins perking at 8 every morning. When  stumble into the kitchen
at 8:05. sleepy eyed and haircurlered, she gives me two kisses. one
on each cheek. Her first two questions are always "How do you
feel” and "Did you sleep well?” and then with a "Bon Appetit
that makes Julia Childs sound Chinese. and carrying a huge tray
heaped with teapot, cups, yummy cakes and the French equivalent of
toast, she heads for her bedroom. .

It’s impossible’ to sleep in on Fridays or Saturdays, because she
always has the vacuum sweeper rumbling by nine. With an energy
that never seems to waver, she cleans the whole five-room apartment
every day—from the hall rug to the bathroom shelves. .

After the housework is finished, there’s the shopping to, do.
Without freezers, shopping is a daily affair in France. Mme. Mura

goes out in smart black boots and an A-Line black wool coat, which V

manages to make her already raven black hair even darker, carry-
ing_a wicker basket over one arm, and a wine bottle_ caddy over the

other. I’ve seen her return with everything from clams still in the'_

shells to California lemons and ketchup, and, best, of all, the mail.

To say she is a good cook considerably understates the reality.
Imagine, if you can, your mother making egg souffle on melba toast,
fish in white wine sauce, and roast chicken, all for the same lunch.
Not to mention an apple pie whose recipe Nixon would probably
covet for the 1976 Bicentennial. .

She's a pinch of this and a‘dash of that cook. I've learned the

V names of all the foods and spices. and even the section of France

that is noted for each dish. In return, I teach her‘ culinary words in
English. She pronounce "eggs" better than Eli.za.Doolittle.t ‘

But I’ve learned more than words in her kitchen. After dinner
one night we started discussing -Women's Lib. I asked her what she
wanted for her daughters. ’ ’ .

“When, any of myichildren choose a profession." she replied,
“the thing I want them to consider is whether or not the-y are per-
sonally suited to that profession. Take my daughter Edith. for exam-
ple. She‘s a nurse. and physically and mentally that’s a demanding
profession.’ But Edith has a" strong personality and very good health-
I think shes ideally suited to be a nurse. She didn't choose nursing
just so she could be called a professional. She chose‘ nursing be-
cause she knew she could be a good nurse. That’s the kind of rea-
soning that’s important.” - '

Mme. Mura herself is the right—hand woman i_n the real estate-

O insurance office Mr. Mura owns. She, keeps an immense.file sys-
— term in perfect order, talking to different agents as they come in,

reading mail, eveii watering the plants. During two weeks in Janu-

ary when Mr. Mura waslill, Mme. Mura ran the office, even send- ' '

.ing out all the bills.

‘As she worked on /them each night I kidded~' her about all the
“Love letters” she was writing, she quickly replied, “Ah, ma cherie,
my love letters are better than yours. There is always a check in.
my replies!«,’’ ‘

But even at seven her work doesn’t stop. By 7:45 all sorts of
yummy smells start creeping under the kitchen door; She almost

outdoes lunch at dinner. although not quite, respecting the tradition ’

of the importance of lunch. But homemade soup, beef or pork roast

,  v and _a highly seasoned-s salad is not an unusual dinner menu.

-Dinner is animated. with Mme. Mura initiating or heartily join-
ing the abundant conversation. But I remember a night when she and
I ate alone, a night when the conversation was more serious. ,

It’s difficult for me to imagine what Rouen was like half des-/
troyed by the Nazi bombardments. But it’s even harder to,ima-
gine Mme. Mura, deep in one of, the wine caves near the Seine, ly-
ing. on top of her son, Alain, who is now 304 but who thentwas only
two. I ’

'.‘We lived near the river during, the War. and when the alarms
would sound. I’d wrap Alain up and get down into one if the caves
as fast as I could. I would lay down‘with him tucked under 'me. so
‘when the ceiling would crack and the dust would shower down

_’he‘d be protected." With her hands. she made .a motion like crack-.

~ing plaster falling from the ceiling and dust billowing up from the
floor. -

I .

“When the? sirens would sound again. we would come back up,
but we never knew what would be burned down or who would be
killed. It was particularly bad along the river. because the Germans
wanted to destroy all the factories along the Seine. Finally." "she re;
counted, moving _quickly to the end of the story, “I had to move to
the country outside Rouen for Alain’s sake.”

. And then. looking past my eyes, looking past the wall behind
me. looking back to a time that exists for__me only in history books,

she said, “I remember the day that little town was liberated. A troop .

of Canadian soldiers came first: and a few days later, the Americans."

, Then she kissed me good night. again one kiss on each ‘cheek,’
and said. ‘.‘Bon courage”, that is, “Have Courage, Have Faith". It
was then that I understood the". meaning of the familiar ‘French say- '
ging, the meaningithat shoneclear and bright
’ rechaun eyes set in the kind'Norman face. ' A

Commuter platoon musters heavy artillern

An excerpt from the diary of
Rick Euler, a major in the com-
muter campaign against the loy-
alist dormitory forces:

Monday 8:00 a.m. a seeming-
ly typical'Monday morning. A
small. but determined group of
commuter militia advances over
the cobblestones and potholes of
Pittsburgh and bivouacs in the
Oakland area.

Upon receiving orders from
Central High Command. located
in Room 518 in the Student Union,
our forces divide and each group
moves to an appointed position.

Musical Vienna in the first
quarter of the nineteenth cen-
tury was undoubtedly a city of
imagination and innovation as
far as composition was concern-
ed. With. the _growing influence
of Beethoven and the.budding
genius of Schubert. ~.the Vien-
nese had acquired two compos-
ers to take the places of both
Haydn and Mozart.

While it is. of course. difficult
to understand compositional cir-
cumstances during this period.
one only need listen to its musi-
cal manifestations to have an
idea of the changes taking place.
These ‘musical manifestations
were ably conveyed last week as
pianist Marvin Tartak and flaut-
ist Bernard Goldberg presented
a program devoted to the works
of Beethoven and Schubert.

Tartak opened the program

with the ever energetic Sonata in

A, opus 101 of Beethoven, one of
the first works of the titan’s final
period. Even though tempi seem-
ed somewhat slow here, they were
by no means what could be term-
ed sluggish. The general charac-
ter of the work was conveyed ad-
mirably, although the artist was
evidently nervous. .
Beethoven is reported to have
said ‘that Schubert would most
certainly surpass him as a com-
poser. While Schubert’s early
death made any such possibility
rather nonexistent. there is much
to be found in his music. On
this program. two of his later
works were performed. TheIntro-
duction and Variations on an
Original Theme and the lofty

opus posthumous piano sonata.

trick concert manifests
Vienna's musical muse

In the Variations, Bernard Gold-.

berg and his familiar golden
flute made their appearance on
stage. Even though the’ Intro-
duction section is very fine
Schubert. the Variations are some-
what less than satisfying. especial-
'1y since the composer refuses to
depart from the main key of

. thegintroduction, thus creating a

rather monotonous situation.

Goldberg’s fine breath -"control

and —Tartak’s fine‘ sense of bal-

ance as an accompanist did little
to improve the quality of the
composition. We could only wish
.that Schubert had conceived of

A thislwork without the variations. -

On the other hand, the Opus.
posthumous sonata is quite an—.

other story. Here we have one of
Sc'hubert‘s finest compositions;
a work of grand proportions, filled
with mystical sonority as well_as
humorous turI.efullness. Once
again, Tartak proved himself a
more than competent keyboard
artist. When the work was mark-
ed con delicatezza.' it was play-
ed. that way. What more could
one ask for?

A fairly flawless performance
brought the entire evening to.the
sort of conclusion thateven the
most critical Viennese listener
would have been satisfied with.
There were, of course, the usual
concert hall noises and the tra-
ditional late start. Unfortunate
as these disturbances may be.
they continue and we. .the con-
certgoers. continue to suffer de-
spite fine performances.

- Peter is a solid reflection of
singer‘-composer Peter Yarrow.

dercurrent of anxiety hidden be--V

The drawings of James A.Hanes.
currently displayed at the Book
Center. are a rather sketchy show-
case of a gifted artist's wide
range of capabilities.

As well as creating fine draw-
ings. Hanes has achieved success

in oil painting and portrait paint-. ‘

ing. The purpose of an exhibition
is to display the work of an artist
and not to show just one of his
media of expression as a means
of making money. —

The exhibit succeeds in portray-
ing-an artist with a fine drawing
talent. Eachsketch contains real-
istic' expressions’ of the human

-figure, or studies for oil paint-

ings.

The studies for oils are uually
done in water color, the figure
drawings‘ in pencil and wash or
charcoal. So opposite in stylistic
qualities are these two types of
drawings that upon first glance.
one immediately thinks of__ the
representation of two separate ar-
tists.

The drawings are simple ones.

.with little detail except for the

main subject of the work. The
nude figures. although extreme-

group for about 10 years. But
even the strongest groups often’
scatter. realizing that they are!
compromising individual expres-
sion "for the group."

ers offered her solo album first,
titled appropriately, Mary, with

the parts of the,body and ignore
details such as fingers and hands.
"Nude Seated” and "Nude in A
Chair" emphasize the position
of the human form as it adjusts
to movement. rather than the ob-
ject which causes the movement.

Color is used rarely but
skillfully. with contrasts and
blending. Most of the colors are

‘natural ones—greens, golds, and

browns. A
The only drawing which devi-

l ates from. this tone of natu_ra1ism

is ."Italian Family" where a bright
pinktone highlights a figure. This
drawing is a study for an oil in-
spired by Hanes; impressions of

The three best drawings of the
show are not for sale. They in-
clude two portraits of Hanes‘
daughter Nicole. “Nicole Standing“
and “Nicole In Costume Seated"
portray the shy expressions of
an innocent young girl. The

Prices for the work of James

display continues through March

Pitt‘s women’s basketball team scored an-easy 74-18 victory over I
Carlow college Monday afternoon. The hoopers built up an 18-2
lead early in the game and were never in trouble. Four players were

in double figures, although nobody played more than three quarters.

Jan Clouse and Mary Ellen Klobchar shared the high .scoring

honorswith 18 points apiece.
Rose Smith added 11 and Cathy
Cassel popped in 10; for the

; Cagers. Stephanie Velsmid pac-

ed Carlow with 11 points.

The game was marred by num-
erous traveling violations, as
well as ‘a -large number of per-
sonel fouls, mostly against Car-
low. Twenty-one fouls were call-
ed on Carlow, with one player
fouling out. V

Pitt coach Sandra Bullman was ,
snowbound in Washington D.C.
and was unable to see the squad
even its record‘ at 3-3. Assistant
coach Jan Davis handled the
coaching chores, and indicated
that, she did not want to run up
the score. However,’ the team
plays a .critical game Saturday
at Slippery Rock and the regu-
lars needed work. ~

"Slippery Rock is always ‘a real
tough team and we will have to
be doing everything right to beat
them". "she explained "They are
a small, fast team and are able
to adapt to your style of play
very quickly." ,

In the last four years. the con-
tests between the two schools.

. by RICK ROSENTHAL

Chris Gardner is a three-way. threat for the Pitt gymnastic squad.
He is an all-around performer, part.time manager, and part time

coach.

I .

Chris has lbeenseverely hampered in his attempt to compete
for the squad this year because of a badly bruised wrist. The injury

stops Gardner from having full
controlof his body~while work-
ing his routines. '

However, the injury does not
stop Chris from working for the
squad-—he became part time man-
ager. When the squad traveled to
West Virginia. earlier this year
it was Chris who passed out uni-
forms, meal money, and event
more important, enthusiasm.

Chris is a leader, a person oth-
ers respect and follow. So, “when,

he was injured,- both he and the

squad suffered,” said assistant‘

, coach Ig Perez.

Chris is also a self-ordained
coach. as he continually works
with other gymnasts, trying to
help them with their routines at"
practice performed by most of
the members of this year's squad.

trying to accomplish this through
a meeting, with assistant athletic
director Rosborough.

“This meeting of the squad, the
coaches, and Rosborough will
be a forum for airing our prob-
lems and we hope something
good will come from it,” said
Gardner.

"Chris is a serious individual
who really cares about the pro-
gram at the school and is work-
ing hard to improve it." said
teammate, Ed Swerdlow.

This Saturday, a favored Pitt

/ squad will face another EIGU

opponent, Syracuse, and Pitt
should be victorious. 4 ’

“Chris Gardner will be back
in the lineup after missing al-

p . most the entire. season and his

Barry Parkhill. (See column on
this page). Close behind is‘ Jim
Hobgood,. a hot shooting for-
ward from Unionto_wn’s Laurel
Highlands averaging 15 points.
"He's a very good shooter
against a zone." said Panther

’ Coach Buzz Ridl while discussing

his sizeup of the Cavaliers.- ‘In

. fact. he's deadly against a zone

and we'll have toguard him

man to man." 1
Hobgood will be one of the

prime reasons Ridl will employ

a predominant man defense to- :.-“.m 3 Mt Lebanonwstar De...._

night. As far as guarding Park-
hill. Ridl is_uncertain exactly
what he‘ll do. ’

"‘We’ll use Mickey Martin on
him and maybe Bill Knight-it
depends on what it looks like
during the game,” he continued.
“We may have to bring in some

people from the bench who are_

a bit stronger defensively like
Ken Wagoner.”_ '

Because of Parkhill’s great of-
fensive moves. Virginia will trv
to clear out a side and give him

 

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllé

prospect."

But the State College High School
regard Pitt as highly as it regarded him. In factfnot even 
Penn" State.‘ the vunniversity around which his hometown was 
built. could entice the ysharpshooting prospect. Parkhill had 
his mind set on Virginia and very little could be saidto dis- 

uade him.

V "I talked w'ith_him and his father." commented Ridl.
"when we were uplthere playing ‘a game. We weren't
able to warm him up to Pitt. He was pretty set on Virgin—_

léi.

Obviously the Lions’ efforts to recruit Parkhill were met in‘. 5‘
the same manner, forcing them to close negotiations with-5 '
out- even offering him a scholarship. A semblence of‘ re- --
venge ‘must have~been enjoyed last Wednesday night"when_.
the Cavaliers dropped their second game of the" season to‘
. the Penn Staters, 86-74.
Since his arrival at Virginia.
Parkhill has turned the tide of the
Cavalier basketball horizon. Af-
Virginia
once again became a winner in
1970-71. Barry's sophomore year.
Now as a junior. the‘6—4 guard’ is’
_being toutedas an All—American.
‘ Spearheading a _team that_now'
sports a 19-3 record and a top ten
ranking. Parkhill is averaging al-
most 23 points a game.VHe has
already shattered Virginia‘s sin-_
gle gameiscoring record with a
51 point performance against Bal-

ter ‘17 losing seasons

 dwin Wallace.

$

The "remarkable thing about Parkhill is that be can; do .
it all. Last “year the 6-4 junior led the team with'ass1sts' 9.
(124) and was fourth in rebounding (105). ,His Coach.B1ll-.9.
Gibson praises Parkhill by saying, “He not onlyis the com“-' 
plete player, but a 100 per cent team performer as well._"’- _y. _:

in the Easterns pretty badly. It’s an indi-

“The team had a good year, but I‘
think we should never have lost to either
Michigan or Maryland.” .

Compiling a fine season mark of 15-3-

enroute to his (Bryant's) PIAA title.

"Fuddy” remarked. "Whenever Ilgo against Teagarden. I have
to beat two guys-—both the ref and him. I realize it's hard being a ref-
eree, but I always seem to get the raw end of the deal."

Love did not wrestle as a freshman because he was scholastically
ineligible. _’ I ’ . '
"My not wrestling as a freshman hurt me at the beginning of
the season,” confided Kevin. "Even though I worked out on my own,
I just needed the experience."

‘ Finishing  season at 11-2-1, following two losses in early
January, Love credits part of his surge to the departed Randy Payne.

“At the beginning, I just wanted to win,” related Love. “Randy
told me to relax and wrestle for myself more.”

Kevin, unlike Bryant, is not‘ on a
wrestling scholarship. Attending Pitt on
a Black Studies financial grant. Love
‘competes because he wants to and likes
the idea of not having any “strings at-

“We just don’t get enough publicity,”
sighed Love. “Also, having to wrestle

But even worse, there’s no crowd sup-
port. It was fifty times better in high

AP—Jim Chones might be gone
but Marquettes No. 2 ranking
lingers on in The Associated

poll released Monday.

Whether the Warriors can
continue unbeaten through their
last four regular-season games

and stay behind top-ranked UCLA ’

without Chones, the star center
who signed with the pro N_ew
York Nets last week, is one of
the sport’s most intriguing ques-
tions.

Marquette. which built a 22-0
record with three victories
last week. the final one without
Chones, received one first-place
vote and .715, points in balloting
by a nationwide panel of sports-

In a game which the winner
was the loser and vice versa. the
Fouls edged the Jive 43-42 in
independent intramural action
Monday afternoon at Trees Hall.

Because the two teams were
tied for last place in the
independent division. a pla_yoff
was necessary to determine the
last placeclub for a unique
tourney arranged by Intramural
Director Leo Bemis.

While all of the division win-
ners are participating in the IM
Championship Tournament. Bemis
is allowing all of the division

losers to participate in a losers‘
bracket championship-.

Though future competition was
at stake, the play of the two teams

was spirited throughout the game. '

The Fouls were forced to start
without one of their players and
used a 1-2-1 zone defense to con-
tain the Jive.

However. the Fouls tired quick-
ly and fell behind by. a 30115
score at halftime.

With the "addition of their
fifth ‘man at intermission, the
Fouls began to chip away at the
Jive’s lead. Strong‘ rebounding
and a fast break enabled the

ﬁrstj at Villanova meetgi

' Last weekend. Pitt's drill team. Pershing Rifles Company K-5. I 

took first place out of eight in squad trick drill competition at the
13th Annual Villanova Invitational Drill Meet at Villanova.

"Taking the first place. trophy was the only thing that  

right this weekend" said John Csakvary. Drill Team Commander.

' The team arrived in Philadelphia at 3 a.m."Sa'turday morning? it
in. the middle of a‘ driving sleet storm which soon changed to snow,..“_ __
After only three hours of sleep and a short final practice in a drafty  

parking garage. the team barely made it to the drill meet.

The competition was delayed half an hour and Unit Commander,
John M. Saban was worried that the delay woud take away from
the team's sharpness. v
. At the end of Pitt‘_s seven minute routine. the team left the
floor somewhatunsatisfied ‘with its performance but still confident.

By the end of the meet. however. Pitt has scored a decisive victory ~

beating Northwestern University by 50 points. Delaware finish-
ing third followed by Holy Cross.

The victory was significant since two-thirds of the team has
never been in competition before. ‘

Next week sees a rematch between the Pitt Drill Team and

   

their arch rivals Villanova's Navy drill team at Bowling Green Uni- V! A I

versity in Ohio. -
