Debating Teams
Enter Last Half
Of ‘Hectic Week’

Busy Schedule Sends Members
Here, There, Everywhere;
Two Go To Penn State

Starting today with an appearance
before the freshman pre-medical
group, the men’s debating associa-
tion enters into tl1e last half of its
most hectic week in history. Bernard
Trumper, C38, and Edward Springer,
C39, oppose each other in a discussion
of Socialized Medicine at 12:3
o’clock, in Room 801, Cathedral.

Tomorrow, Albert Brandon, C36,
and Israel Goldberg, C36, oppose Ben
Levin, C38, and Russell Connolly, C36,
at the VVaverly Presbyterian Church,
Vvilkinsburg, in a discussion of the
Supreme Court question.

Friday, two teams appear before
two groups in the afternoon. At 2:30
o’clock they meet before the VVomen’s
Literary Club of Brighton Road, and
at 5 o’clock they appear at the West-
ern Penitentiary. In both debates the
Supreme Court question will be used.

Also on Friday, two members of
the association, accompanied by Dr.
VV. M. Parrish, coach, will journey to
Penn State to take part in a discus-
sion on the question of “How the
United States ca11 best stay out of
war."

The men round out the week with
an appearance before the American
Association of University Women on
Saturday afternoon. James Eiche1-
berger, C38, and Frank Doeringer,
C36, oppose Stanley Rogaliner, C37,
and Arthur Kelley, C37, at the ‘Wil-
liam Penn Hotel, on the Cqurt ques-
tion.

Monday evening, Goldberg and Doer-
inger defended the affirmative of the
Court proposition against representa-
tives of the American Institute of
Banking, in the William Penn Hotel.
It was the ﬁrst meeting between the
University and the Institute.

Upholders of the negative maintain-
ed that the University men suggested
virtual abolition of the Constitution,
that the Supreme Court is the proper
body to determine questions of consti-
tutionality, and that the
basic law is a flexible document.

‘Attacked ‘on the ground that the‘

Child Labor Amendment has not been
ratiﬁed, despite the obvious desire of
the people to see the end of work by
chiltlren, the bankers contended, “It
mvst be that the people still want
child labor, or we would have the
amendment passed by now.”

Five Engineering
Seminars Planned

Salzberg, Hallock, Stone, Sherrill,
Van Wert, Spooner To Speak

Five engineering seminars meet

Lennig Sweet To Speak
At Inquiry Forum Today

Lennig Sweet will be the speaker
at the regular meeting of Inquiry
Forum today in Room 107, Alumni
Hall. He will speak on “China,
Russia, and Japan—What next?”

Mr. Sweet is the son of ex-Gov-
ernor William Sweet of Colorado,

Year on the New Deal and the
Roosevelt administration. Mr.
Sweet is a graduate of Princeton
University, and for a number of
years represented that institution
in China. After that he served a
number of years as a YMCA sec-
retary in Peiping, the heart of the
area which has ﬁgured in the for-
eign news of the Far East for the
last few years.

Players’ Technical
Staﬁ Hits Trouble
In Staging Sh ow

Making new scenery —- because
“Cock Robin,” the Rice4Barry murder
mystery to be presented by Pitt Play-
ers March 25 and 26 requires 16-foot
drops instead of the usual 12-foot—and
the prospect of turning the stage com-
pletely around for the second set on
the two performance nights is both-
ering Players’ technical staff.

The show will be expensive to pro-
duce. More than $200 worth of lum-
ber, two power saws—one circular
a.nd one band-«and numerous small
items in the hardware and paint line
were hauled into the technical shop
below the stadium last week.

Special rehearsals of the stage
hands will be held before the opening
night to obtain speed in changing the
set in the second act, when the Cope
Valley Community Players present
their play-within-a-play, and the real
audience is supposed to be backstage.
Footlights to be used in front of the
black backdrop, which will represent
the imaginary audience, require the
use of an extra switchboard.

When Carl B. Cass, faculty director
of Players, and Charles Foreman, as-
sistant, produced the show at Wiscon-
sin last summer, reversal of the scene
was made by fou_r_men working at
high speed 'ii’i"‘c.‘éﬁ“’"Iiiii1utes.‘ '   

Immediately after scenery for “Can-
dida” was dismantled and put away,
the technicians began work on the
set for “Cock Robin,” part of which
will be used for the Cap and Gown
show.

A miniature stage set for “Cock
Robin,” complete in detail, is on dis-
play on the second ﬂoor of Alumni
Hall. ’

Yakhontoﬂ

Discuss Far East Problem

In a vigorous ta.lk Monday before
a special meeting of Inquiry Forum,
Major-General Victor Yakhontoff dis-
cussed the present and probable sit-
uation in the Far East.

The present state of affairs, accord-
ing to the general, does not make a
"cozy” picture, and he thinks that
there is little justiﬁcation in trying
to be blindly optimistic. “The Far
East is the focus of all kind of trouble.
No matter what happens it is excit-
ing, even if it’s not exactly what was
expected. The present troubles in
the Far East will continue to brew for
a long while.”

In Major-General Yakontoff’s opin-
ion there are three widely-held but
erroneous notions about the Far
East. Many people when thinking of
Japan consider her as a small, insular
power, poor in natural resources and
with a population a good deal smaller
than that of the United States. This
belief is not founded on fact, the
speaker pointed out. It is true that
Japan proper ﬁts this description
more or less, but in addition to this,
Japan has a large and rich colonial

empire, which has not only a large
population but is not without valuable
mineral resources. -

In the second place, General Yak-
hontoff went on, many people think
that the United States has no special
interest in Asia. Although the Amer-
ican investment in the Far East is
considerably smaller than Eng'and’s,
it is the trend that in General Yak-
hontoff’s opinion is most signiﬁcant.
In 1924 the United States trade was
one-half billion dollars, but in 1928,
just four years later, this had jumped
to two billion dollars.

Third. there is the common opinion
that war between Russia and Japan
is inevitable. War is not inevitable,
said the speaker. Russia doesn’t want
war, neither does Japan. In Japan
there is, he admitted, a small group
of jingoists who might by some rash
act precipitate war, but that war is a
possibility does not mean that it is
inevitable. ,

At this point General "Yakhontoff
launched into a discussion of the fa-
mous “open door” policy. This policy

Of Scholars’ Tap Day In Schenley Friday

W

Dr. D. S. Kimball, Speaker,
Will Be Honor Guest
Of WSGA Group

Beginning at 3:30 o’clock, allthose
tapped at the Scholars’ Day cere-
mony will be guests at a. Congratula-
tions Hour sponsored by VVSGA at
Heinz House Friday afternoon. Dr.
D. S. Kimball, main speaker at the
ceremony, will be the guest of honor.

At least 16 honorary scholastic fra-
ternities will participate in the tap-
ping exercises, according to Israel
L. Goldberg, C36, chairman. The
name of each tappee will be inscribed,
as was done last year, in the “Book
of the Scholars,” a permanent volun'.-_-
containing a complete record of stu-
dents honored on Scholars’ Day. _

The tapping will be held, beginning
at 11:30 o’clock, iii the main ballroom
of the Hotel Schenley. Go.dberg will
be the presiding officer. Norman
Horowitz, C36, will present the $10
Pi Tau Phi award to the college sen-

‘Campaign To Be
Bitter’——-Tippetts

Oratory, Mud-Slinging To Feature
Election, Dean Tells Engineers

“I expect the coming political cam-
paign to “Iii-.“o1ie"'or‘ the ' most ‘bia“e‘ri'y
fought iii the history of the country.”

Such was the opinion of Dr.
Charles S. Tippetts, dean of the
School of Business Administration, ex-
pressed at last week’s meeting of the
Pitt Engineers’ Club, YMCA—spon-
sored organization. Dean Tippetts
spoke on, “Issues of the Coming Po-
litical Campaign.”

“During the next few months, there
is certain to be a great deal of oratory
and mud-slinging waged over two is-
sues: the gold standard and farm re-
lief. ‘While there is at present much
bickering as to the dropping of the
gold standard in 1932, both Democrats
a11d Republicans will pledge them-
selves to securing some sort of mod-
iﬁed farm relief program.”

According to Dean Tippetts, the
election of "'32 was freakish for one
outstanding reason. He believes that
the people did not vote for Franklin
D. Roosevelt because of his popular-
ity or views as much as to vote
against Hoover.

In regard to the possible Republican
candidates, Dr. Tippetts see two men:
Borah and Landon.

“Senator Borah is the most logical
choice the Republicans have at the
present time,” he said. “If he should
be elected, the corporations and
monopolies would. have cause for
alarm. As I see it, Governor Landon
of Kansas has committeed a grave
fault that would do much to prevent
his ever getting into the White House.
He is now on- record as deﬁnitely op-
posing the New Deal, but during the
earlier part of Roosevelt’s term, he
is known to have deﬁnitely favored
certain aspects of the. program. Peo-
ple are not apt to forget statements
by prominent men in politics.”

Dean Tippetts feels that the Demo-
crats will have to answer several per-
plexing questions that Republicans
will be sure to hurl at them. Repub-
licans will ask what the Democrats
are going to do about balancing the
budget, politics in relief, and inﬂation.
The Republicans will also be sure to
make an issue of the fact that billions
have been spent, while millions are
still out of jobs.

“But,” concluded the dean, “it will
be a great battle.”

The next meeting of the Engineers’
Club will be held tomorrow, ﬁfth
hour, in the Y Conference Room, 801,
Cathedral. The speaker will be Dr.
Bernard C. C-lausen, pastor of the
First "Baptist Church.

Dr. Voss Will Speak
Before Lenten Group

The pastor of one of the city’s old-
est churches will be speaker at the
second in the series of Lenten talks,
sponsored by the YM-YWCA. Dr. Carl
August Voss, of the Smithﬁeld Congre-
gational Church, will talk on “The
Unﬁnished Task of Christ” at 12:30
o’clock Thursday.

The meeting will not take place in
Heinz House as scheduled, but instead
will be held in Room 1309, Cathedrgl.
The student chairmen for this meet-
ing are Helen Robinson, Ed37, and
Vvilliam Millard, E38. Students are
invited.

‘Physician Illustrates
Psych Forum Lecture

Dr. Priestes Reports On Anaesthesia
Of Spine At Regular Meeting

.__..______ _ °

Illustrating his lecture by a “chalk
talk,” Dr. John Priestes, resident
physician of Weste1'n State Peniten-
tiary, addressed the Psychology
Forum Monday on _ “Psychological
Phenomena Observed in Spinal
Anaesthesia.”

“No emotional effects are noted in
the patient until the paralysis caused
by the injection reaches, in the spinal
column, the muscle ﬁbers governing
the respiration,” stated Dr. Priestes.
“When the patient ﬁnds himself
breathing with difficulty, he experi-
ences fear and worry. Prior to that,
he is apathetic, and conditions around
him have no effect whatsoever on
him. The height of the paralysis is
regulated by the dilution of the
anaesthesia‘ introduced at the base of
the spinal cord.”

Dr. Priestes is a graduate of the
University’s School of Medicine.

Dr. George E. Jones, professor of
psychology, was chairman of the
forum.

Group Plans Trip
To See Original
Van Gogh Works

Elliott Discusses Life, Paintings
Of Belgian Artist At Exhibition
Of Reproductions Here

By Sydney Horovitz

Students and faculty members who
read Irving Stone's “Lust for Life,”
a fictionized biography of Vincent
Van Gogh, and who inspected the ex-
hibition of reproductions of the Van
Gogh paintings at Heinz House Mon-
day and were still not satisfied, may
arrange to hie themselves en masse
to Cleveland, where the tour of orig-
inal Van Goghs will make a stand.

Philip C. El iott, assistant professor
of fine arts, has consented to lead the
group from the University which is
planning to go to Cleveland since the
exhibit will not come here.

Those interested should contact B-Ir.
Elliott at once at the ﬁne arts depart-
ment, Room 109, State Hall.

In an informal talk accompanying
the exhibition of ‘Van Gogh reproduc-
tion, Mr. Elliott discussed the life and
career of the painter. An exhibition
of the works attracted such huge
throngs in New York City that the
American Museum of Modern Art was
obliged to stage a return showing.

“Vincent Van Gogh,” said Mr. El-
liott, “is a branch of one of the devel-
opments which followed Cezanne and
the impressionist technique. Starting

out from the scientiﬁc impressio11ism'

which attempts to catch with exact
precision the way light falls on solid
objects and leaves an impression, Van
Gogh turns to an individual projection
of mood and feeling and expression.
If he goes down to the coal mines
and imagines that there must be no
God, he feels that. he must say so
and that he must sa.y so by putting it
into his painting.

“Essentially a romantic, Van Gogh
spent his life as he painted——a long
line of wild individualistic experieiices
and emotions. At times he became
completely insane.”

The most striking characteristic of
the exhibit loaned by the ﬁne arts de-
partment was, your reviewer feels, a
vitality and movement and meaning.

Van Gogh, taking advantage of the
technique of color combinations and
of building up a picture structura.lly
and architecturally, adds to it an in-
dividuality of effect which heightens
its signiﬁcance.

There were 21 reproductions, sev-
eral of which carry comments by Van
Gogh himself. He sa.ys,

Of “Night Cafet” “I have tried to-
express the terrible passions of hu-
manity by means of red and green
. Exaggeratecl studies like this
seem to me usually atrociously ugly
and bad, but when I am moved by
something——then they a.re the ones,
only, which appear to have any deep
meaning.”

Of “Sunﬁowersz” “It is a kind of
painting that changes to the eye and
ta.kes on a richness the longer you
look at it.”

Of “Boats at Saintes—Maries:” “The
Mediterranean has the color of mack-
erel—cha.ngea.ble. I mean."

Of “The Postman Roulin:” “There
is no better or shorter way of improv-
ing your work than doing ﬁgures. And
I always feel conﬁdent when I am (lo-
ing portraits, knowing that the work
has much more depth.”

Paintings which appealed in partic-
ular to me were “The Reaper” (be-
cause of its sensitive treatment of
gold color. its movement and lines,
and its solid impression harmonizing
with its theme): “La Guinguette. Gar-
den Wine-house in the Suburbs” (be-
cause of its 11nity of varied elements
and its life-like movement): “Dr.
Gachet” (because of its individuality
of line); and “The Lark” (because
of the texture of the ground).

Eberhart To Speak

E. Kingman Eberhart, instructor in
economics, will address the Chatham
Street branch of the YWCA tomorrow
at 2 o’clock. He will speak on the
topic “Causes for Unemployment.”

 

 

Alumni Association Prepares
Projects For Coming Your

 

Five projects have been planned by
the General Alumni Association for

the ensuing year. These are embodied
in a report on the status of the As-
sociation prepared by John W’. Hal-
lock, secretary of the organization.

The ﬁrst project under considera-
tion is the addition to alumni ﬁles
of all former students who were in
the University two semesters or more.
Others include the study of economic
status of the alumni, expansion of the
personal data ﬁle regarding the alum-
ni, extension of Placement Bureau
services, and the establishment of an
alumni fund.

The report also included statistics
concerning the organization. They
show a grand total of 25.300 alumni
listed on the records. Of this number,
2,087 are “paid up” members in the
General Alumni Association. These
are separated into 10 constituent as-
sociations. The out-of—town graduates
are enrolled in 12 Pitt clubs, scattered
all over the country. The report lists
31 elected members and four officers
of Alumni Council. The Council, it

reveals, held ﬁve meetings during the
past year, while the executive commit-
tee of the Association has met a like
number of times.

Two amendments to the constitu-
tion of the General Alumni Associa-
tion were also adopted at the recent
annual meeting. The ﬁrst of these
adds the provision that retiring presi-
dents shall be termed “past presi-
dents” fo_r a period of two years fol-
lowing their term as president. This
amendment will give Alumni Council
the beneﬁt of the advice and experi-
ence of retiring presidents.

The other authorizes the appoint-
ment of an executive committee to
facilitate the work of Council between
meetings. This committee will have
the power to transact urgent busi-
ness of council between meetings.
This committee, according to the
amendment, is to be made up of one
member of council from each of the
constituent associations, and the of-
ﬁcers of Alumni Council, thus total-
ing 14 members. The power of ap-
pointment to this committee will be
in the hands of the alumni president.

features of the Junior Prom held last week.

No Parking
Students of the University of Southern California who

The University of North Carolina has ruled that any
student “who does not habitually write good English"
must go to the Engilsh department for periodical pol-

Fun In Fraternities ,

During the Hell Vveek oi‘ sororities at Purdue Univer-
sity one of the actives of a certain house landed in jail.
Of course, the pledges were not able to use their cars
during the initiation period. Some of the pledges saw
an active driving one of the pledge’s cars. As :1. prac-
tical joke the pledges told the local police that the car
had been stolen. It took much explaining by members
oi‘ Lhe sorority to get the girl released.

Turn About

The professors at Georgia State College for Women
got the last laugh this time. Some time ago the stu-
dents listed the peculiarities of the teachers. Now the
instructors have had their say. Student peculiarities,
dubbed “Life Shorteners," included.

Knitting in class, wearing hair skewered in strange
coiffeurs, drawing funny pictures instead of taking notes,
looking at watches every ﬁve minutes and allowing foun-
tain pens to run dry in the first ﬁve minutes of a test.

Music Master
To stress :1 point. concerning the medieval English bal-
lads used as drinking songs. one piofessor at the State
College of Washington surprised students with a sudden
outburst of “There Is a Tavern in the Town.”

His Brother's Keeper

“I will positively refuse to allow necking in my classes
this year,” announced 11 Northwestern sociology profes-
sor. “until I come to the subject of sex in my lectures.”

Continuing, he added, “And even then I might not
allow it, but Tuand-holding will be permitted.”

"‘Yon don’t believe it ever happened do you?” demand-
ed the professor of :1 boy sitting in the front row. “VVell,
-1+ was your older brother.”

Foreign W0 rice r
Pictures Siamese

Life For Y Club

The educational life of the Siamese
people was pictured for members of
the Freshman Club by Walter A. Zim-
merman, a leader in the foreign work
of the YMCA, at the regular meeting
of the group in the Y «Club Rooms
Monday noon.

Mr. Zimmerman, who recently re-
turned from Bangkok, Siam, where he
spent ﬁve years, ﬁrst discussed the
history of education in this far bast-
ern country. “Historically,” he said,
“the ﬁeld of education was dealt with
by the Buddhistic Church.” A com-
pulsory education law. Mr, Zimmer-
man explained, is now gradually forc-
ing education from the church into
the hands of the state. “This law is
being enforced as fast as the govern-

ernment can take care of the inﬂux
of students,” he stated. However,
he declared that some of the educa-
tion is still being dispensed in the
Buddhist temples.
No Extra-Curricular Activities

“VVith the passing of compulsory
laws,” Mr. Zimmerman continued,
“there is a new thirst for knowledge.”
Consequently, he explained that the
government is hard put to provide
adequate facilities. Thirty thousand
students are now enrolled in second-
ary schools in the kingdom. There
have also been established several
universities, one of them the Univer-
sity of Moral and Political Science in
Bangkok.

There are no extra-curricular activ-
ities in the schools, he revealed. “The
antiquated methods of teaching de-
nies students the experience gained
from extra-curricular studies.” In
this connection he mentioned that the
purpose of the Y Association with
which he served in Siam, is to intro-
duce these extra studies to the curri-
culums of schools. The response to
this program has been remarkable,
he declared.

The speaker outlined the status of
Siam in the present day, stating that
it is an independent monarchy in
spite of the fact that all of the na-
lions around it have fallen prey to im-
perialistic nations. “The people are
of Mongol stock,” he mentioned, “and
are not related to those of many of
the surrounding territories. “Siam_."
he observed, “is on the threshold of
a new departure in social and eco-
nomic life.”

‘Music Goes Round’ In Latin
To End Language Club Revel

 

Nearly 200 Students, Faculty Attend Sigma Kappa Phi’s
Open House Friday Evening At Heinz House

 

By Milton G-

Busino per hic,
Musica it circa et circa
Ooo-ooo et venit ab hoc;

Depello epistomium,
Musica it circa et circa
Ooo-ooo et venit ab hoc;

Depello med epistomium
Musica descendet circa
Subter, subter, subter
Subter-er-er-er

Audi tumultum venit:

Depello ultimum
Musica it circa et circa,
Ooo-ooo et venit ab hoc.

And so, to the soothing Latinized
version of “The Music Goes ’Round
and ’Round,” by Estelle hurkalska,
Ed37, of the Classical Club, the pro-
gram of Sigma Kappa Phi’s largest at-
tended Open House conclrded. Sigma
Kappa Phi, honorary foreign language
fraternity, held its annual internation-
al program, last Friday night from 8
to 10: o’clock at Heinz House. The
affairs, planned under the direction
of Martha Marsh, Ed36, president of
the fraternity, drew nearly 200 stu-
dents and teachers. Dr. Whitford H.
Shelton, professor of modern lan-
guages commented: “I was elated by
the ﬁne quality of the performance of
the language groups, and was equally
pleased by the large number of stu-
dents that turned out.”

Comedy In French

The evening included presentations
by students in the French. Italian,
and Classical Clubs, and members of
the German classes. Introduced by
Miss Marsh, the Frenchmen began
the evening with a one-act play,
“Marivaudinettes,” directed and coach-
ed by Miss Blossom L. Henry, assist-
ant professor of modern languages.
The persons in the play, who produced
a.n unusual love triangle, were Grand-
pere, Gerald Barry, C37; Grandmere,
Shirley Perlow, C37\; Ninette, Ruth
Recht, C37; and the suitors for the

Room hand, Jacques, Harry Golby,

C39, and Maurice, Howard Dickinson,
C38.
Following several choral numbers,

Lehman, Jr.

the Frenchmen withdrew and the Ital-
ian Club took the stage. Peppered
with a vibrant folk dance by Lenore
Molinari. C39. and Louis Mammone.
BA37, the audience leaned forward
as one. II-Iarold Dickinson, C37, who
took part in the French play. read an
excerpt from Manzoni’s “I Promessi
Sposi." Elia Mossesso. C39, delivered
a “Prayer to Venice” with the skill of
an orator. Following the individual
performances, the entire group sang
several Italian songs.

Parnes ls Toastmaster

Introduced by Meyer Levinson, C37.
Herbert Parnes, C39, toastmastered
the German show, which was directed
and composed of the classes of Dr.
Lotte Lohstoeter, assistant professor
of modern languages. Casting slight
innuendoes here and there, Parnes
presented Die Pittmusikanten, a ques-
tionable 01'ganizai.i0n including lRay
Light, C38, Paul Kromer, C37, Howard
E'ngelma.n. C38, Vernon Kr-ahl, C39.
and Robert Harris, C38. The boys
quintetted bravely through several
Volklieder. Then followed readings
of original poems by students in the
German department. Mildred Corben,
C37, read Louise l\lcKirdy’s sonnet
“Die Schnee;” John Weisbrod, C39. de-
livered Michael lvanovitch’s “Unster-
blichkeit,” and Milton Lehman, C39,
read his sonnet, “Die VVahrheits-
schlacht,” Louis Golder, C39, a11d Frank
Engel, C38, and Krahl sang soft and
sweet, and the audience joined in on
the chorus to “ZWei Herzen in Drei-
vierteltakt.”

Give Amateur Show

The ‘Classical Club, deviating from
the readings of the previous acts, put
on 2111 amateur show with Mary Ru-
bino, Ed36, as master of ceremonies.
Miss Rubino introduced Christine
Greco, Ed37, who burnt Rome down
on the piano, Beulah Confer, C38, who
juggled, and Laurence De Leurere,
Ed36, who, to the accompaniment of
sweet music, read 0vid’s “Rules of
Love.” And then the Classical Club
went unclassical for a moment with
Miss Durkalska’s version of the “Mu-
sic Goes ’Round and ’Rou11d,” sung by
the entire group.

Dancing and refreshments, as prom-
ised by previous releases, did follow
the program, and so closed Sigma

Kappa Phi’s Open House.

Collembolae Makes Plans

Basketeers Face
West Virginia U.
Tonight In Finale

Fourth Straight Conference Title
Looms If Panthers Can Lick
Tough Mountaineer Team

Snuffy Smith and all his Mo11ntain-
eer pals down the Morgantown trails
will put away thar shootin’ irons and
thar feuds tonight and amble out to
the Vvest Virginia University cage
court to see the Panther and Moun-
taineer basketball teams settle a little
feud of their own.

Snuffy and his pals don’t know much
about this ’yar game of hooping, but
they know enough to realize that to-
night's game is going to be one of
those bodacious basketball games that
comes too seldom. They understand
that it’s billed as the season's most
important conference clash, and that
it’s up to these’n Mountaineers to gum
up the Panther march to their fourth
Straight league title.

Tonight’s battle, aside from assum-
ing the proportions of the most impor-
tant, is the ﬁnal game of the season
for both the Panthers and the Moun-
taineers. It has the Panthers closing
a 26-game schedule and Captain Ted
Roderick and Big Pete Noon playing
their last game in regular collegiate
basketball for the blue and gold col-
ors.

Several weeks ago the Mountain
boys came to Pittsburgh for a game
with the Pitt cagers, who were then
in fourth place. The Panthers gave
West Virginia a sound 41-27 whip-
ping and since then have climbed "D
to their present strangle-hold on the
lead position.

If the Mountaineers whip the Pitt
passers tonight, it means that a play-
off will be necessary between the
Panthers and Tech’s cagers to decide
the championship. Last season the
Carlsonmen journeyed down to Mor-
gantown under almost the same cir-
cumstances, and the West Virginians
plastered a 43-26 shellacking on the
Cats to necessitate a play-off. battle.

-Coach Sleepy Glenn's lineup in-
cludes ﬁve starters that faced Pitt last
year. Red Gocke Barna, Phares, Mes-
trovic, and Colebank rate as one of
the best teams in the district. Gocke
ha.s walked away with conference
scoring honors this season, and has
scored 23 and 22 points in games with
Penn State and \V&.I. respectively.

League ‘B’~I_11te—i—°frat
Cagers Play Tonight

Interfraternity basketball resumes
action tonight up at Trees Gym with
three league “B” games scheduled. At
7 o’clock, Phi Gamma Delta battles
Phi Delta Theta. Following this, the
Delts stack up against the Sigma
Alpha Mu basketeers, and at 9 o’clock,
the Pi Lambs and the Pi K As get to-
gether in their game.

In the other league, the Phi Kap
cagers meet the Kappa Sigs in an im-
po1'tant game tomorrow night. Other
league “A” teams are listed to play
Thursday night, with the Lambda
Chis battling the Theta Chis and the
Phi Eps moving against Sigma Chi.

, Over The Weekend |

Sport ﬂashes of the weekend just
passed ﬁnds that Panther athletes
came through with an even split in
four major sports; basketball, swim-
ming, track, and boxing: The basket-
ball and swimming classes did just
what their teachers told them, while
the tracksters and the boxers got their
cues mixed.

PITTSBURGH. March 7.—Penn
State's cagers threw one of the sea-
v3n’s worst scares into the Panthers
basketeers, when they forced the
Pitt boys to come from behind and
win the game in the last minute and
half of pla.y, 41-38. With the victory,
the Panthers removed another ob-
stacle from their path. heading to-
wards their fourth straight Eastern
Intercollegiate Conference title.

Dr. Sutherland Decides To Shift
Opening Date Of Practice

The most important stage in the de-

spring training drills, will begin Mon-
day with the issuance of equipment on
the opening day of the spring training
in preparation for the 1936 season.
’l‘his announcement opens the sea-
son two days earlier than the previous
plans. Dr. John Bain Sutherland, head
coach, decided to shift the opening
date to Monday, as the result of the
early arrival of suitable weather.

At any rate, the bulletin board pla-
cards issuing the call for football can-
didates should carry the date-line
Harch 16, rather than that of March
18. Dr. Sutherland is especially anxi-
ous to have boys report for uniforms,
regardless of previous experience.
“Not only do we want those boys
who have played football in high
school. but we also welcome those
who have never played football. There
are suits for everyone,” he concluded.

Grapplers Hope To Close Season
With Win Over Mountaineers

 

Eager for the taste of victory, a de-
termined band of varsity wrestlers de-
parted this afternoon for Morgantown,
where they will meet the strong West
Virginia grappling team.

Coach Mazeski is hoping for the
team to avenge their five setbacks this
season, and he is looking for a re-
versal of form from the Panthers to-
night.

Three members of the mat team
will ﬁnish their careers for the Blue
and Gold tonight. The three men,
who write “ﬁnis” to their wrestling

activities tonight, are Art Detzel,
heavyweight. A1 Noble, 145-pounder,

and Hal Neibel, 165-pounder. On the
other hand, tonight's match will mark

the debut of Irving Vatz, who is to be
entered in the 135 pound class.

Twelve-Man Squad To Compete
At South Bend On Saturday

A group of 12 Panther track and
ﬁeld performers defends the team title
in the Central Intercollegiate Cham-
pionships, Saturday, in the South Bend
ﬁeld house.

Pitt will repeat its 1935 indoor vic-
tory only if every man in the sound
that makes the trip places high
enough to score points for the team
title. As was the case last year, there
are no outstanding men to carry the
Panthers to victory over the fastest
track teams in the Big—Ten and Mid-
west.

Michigan State, Notre Dame, Mar-
quette, and Michigan Normal should
give the Olsonmen a ﬁght all the way.
In fact, it will almost be an upset for
Pittsburgh to repeat last year’s per-
formance on the basis of comparative
performances.

While many of the competing
schools with ﬁne ﬁeld houses have
raced in dual meets with neighboring
schools, the Pitt boys have had only
the championship events to test a
small majority of the squad.

Pitt’s relay quartet, which has yet
to ﬁnd itself, will make the trip along
with Red Tost, Andy Lasky, Franklyn
Theriault, Pete Bennett, Redmon
Oden. Bob Gerrety. an additional
sprinter, and the 12th man to be
chosen from the most promising in
the daily squad work-outs.

When I-Iyatt scooped in a high
pass, sighted the hoop over his left
shoulder. and then let ﬂy from his
position high above the press box

and ﬁrst tier of fans in that game
six years ago, James Hagan. ’28,
and present graduate manager of
athletics. received his biggest “sin-
gle kick.”

“Chipper Cholly” caught, aimed.
and shot that ba.ll all in one
smooth motion with both feet off
the ﬂoor. His position far to the
side lines and deep in the corner
was more of a handicap than even
his unorthodox pose in mid-air.

That shot climaxed a typical
Hyatt ﬁeld-night, bringing up his
evenings total to 29 markers
gainst a great Montana State ﬁve.
Ca1'lson’s Pitt cagers, thanks to Mr.
I-Iyatt again, whipped the western
representatives. 44-42, that even-
ing late in the 1930 season. It
came right in the height of Hyatt’s
senior campaign.

Reviewing the performance,
Hagan claimed it was absolutely

State Cave Hagan His Biggest ‘Kick’

 

the greatest single feat he had
ever witnessed in athletics. Hagan,
probably one of the lightest grid
stars in Pitt history, was also one
of the toughest and scrappiest half-
backs.

‘Weighing 170 pounds, Hagan was
right in there giving and taking it
from the 2-00-pounders for three
years. G-ibby VVelch, one of the
greatest halfbacks in history, can
well remember Ha.gan’s. ﬁne block-
ing, kicking, and defensive play
that aided him in his dazzling
downﬁeld drives.

From way back in 1925, Hagan
recalls the time Wissinger, a line-
man, scooped up a fumble and then
h.»mb.ered on down the ﬁeld for the
only touchdown of the game to
beat the \Vash-Jeff eleven. This V
also gave him a “kick.” i

Bobby I-Ioga-n’s 70-yard behind- g

a Pitt victory over Notre Dame in l
1032 was right in there with Wis- 
singer’s and Hyatt’s feats, accord— I

Nothing is

ever perfect

FOR 1936 we offer what we
think is the ﬁncst car in Ford '
history. But no car is ever con-
sidered perfect and ﬁnished
as far as Ford engineers are
concerned. Once a year we
introduce new models—sincc
that is the custom-—but con-
stantly we make improve-
ments in our car, for that is
our lifelong habit. We don’t
wait for Show time to make
a better car.

Proof of this is the present‘
Ford V- 8. In basic design it is
almost the same as when in-
troduced four years ago. But
in performance and economy

FORD

 

MOTOR

there is no comparison be-
tween the 1932 and 1936 cars.

Ford engineers do not work
with yearly models in mind.
The Ford Motor Company
does not wait for introductory
dates to incorporate improve- ,
ments. As soon as exhaustive \
tests prove that a new mate-
rial is better, into production
it goes. VVhcn new machining
processes or new inspection
methods are proved superior,
in they go also.

The purchasers get the ad-
vantage of all improvements
as soon as We are certain that
they are improvements.

Today is the last day in which
senior women can indicate their
preference for Senior Queen nominees
by ﬁlling out the ballot below and de-
positing it in the ballot box at Heinz
House. Partially guided by the
names suggested in this preliminary
vote, a special Senior Queen nominat-

traditional standards of “character,
personality, achievement in academic
studies, success in extracurricular
activities, and contributions to the life
of the University.”

signed by a senior woman to be con-
sidered by the committee. Following
the committee's selection of nominees,
the senior class will vote for their
Queen on women's election

will be kept secret until Activities
Tap Day in May, at which the woman
who receives the highest number of
votes will be formally declared queen,

140 Women Saturday

Approximately 140 women from
neighboring and local universities par-

Playday held last Saturday in Trees
Gymnasium.

As guests of VVAA, the women
played basketball for the major part
of the afternoon. Pitt had three teams
entered in the games, known as teams
A. B. and C. ‘It seems that they
couldn't hold down the California
State Teachers College basketball
team, so California walked off with
all the honors by winning every game
they played,

After the basketball games the W0-
men went down to the pool for some
more fun.

Almost all of the Women stayed for
dinner which was served in the Cathe-
dral Mansions.

Heart Hop Proﬁt Of $100

the only happiness in store for the

Russian General
Discusses East

(Continued From Page One)
was only partially successful, and
when Japan tried to obtain a position
of special interest in the market of
China, the “open door” broke down
completely. As General Yakhontoff
views the immediate situation, it is
the result of a conﬂict of commercial
interests for the Chinese market,
which is so vast that “no nation with
a well developed industrial system
can aft'ord to neglect it.”

Japan therefore set out on her fa-
mous adventure into Manchuria, and
began to interpret the “open door”
policy with an eye to her own inter-
ests. VVhen the other powers didn"t
like her interpretation she walked
out of the parleys, as recently hap-
pened in London, or announced her
intention of refusing to abide by cer-
tain treaties, as for example, the
Vvashington Treaty. The primary rea-
son why Japan wants a large navy is
not to attack the United States or the
Soviet but merely to keep those coun-
tries away from China. General Yak-
hontoff doubts whether Japan will be
successful in this.

Suggests Three Policies

In the future the United States has
three choices as to the policy it will
pursue in the Far East, according to
the General. It can attempt to with-
draw itself completely from Far East-
ern affairs. General Yakhontoff does
not believe that the United States
would seriously attempt this. Second,
there is war, which is “silly just now.”
Third, and most feasible of all, is the
policy of limited objectives. This
means being alert and trying always
to check Japan from going too far.
of trying to realize limited possibili-
ties as they arise. It means a ﬂexible
policy instead of one bound by a hard
and fast declaration.

“It is not enough just to drift and
muddle through the Far Eastern sit-
uation in the typical Anglo—Saxon
manner,” exclaimed General Yakhon-
toff. “There must be some order, some
plan to the policy. There must be
thought given to alignments, and by
alignments I do not mean alliances.
The interests of the United States and
Russia in the Orient almost coincide.
And peace in the East depends upon
the continued maintenance of good
relations between the United States
and the -Soviet Russia.”

Former Parisienne Relates
Many Adventures Overseas

By Marion Mehlman

Those students who long for ad-
ventures on the high seas and college
life among the Parisians and the Eng-
lish should corner Helen Reynolds,
Ed36, and ask for her story of life
across the water. Miss Reynolds de-
clded to enroll in the University of
Paris after a year of undergraduate
work at Goucher -College in Baltimore
and one at the University of Bucknell
in Lewisburg.

On her way to Paris in September,
1933, she traveled on the same boat
as Maurice Chevalier to whom she was
introduced at a party given by the
captain. Ask Miss Reynolds for all
further details. On the same boat she
met a French spy who was on his 17th
trip around the world. It wasn’t until
last year when he was killed in the
Canadian woods that Miss Reynolds
learned that her friend was a woman
masquerading as a man. The girl had
taken the place of her twin brother
who had been killed in the VVorld



Upon arriving in Paris Miss Rey-
nolds enrolled in Le Faculte Des Let-
tres, part of the University of Sor-
bonne. In order to get the real atmos-
phere of French homelife, she moved
into the home of Gabriel Roby, Basque
artist who won the Grande Prix at the
Luxemburg last year.

While in Paris Miss Reynolds took
solo work as a mezzo-soprano under

the tutelage of.a Swedish doctor. ‘She

remained in Paris during Armistice
Day and insists that the French disre-
gard our part in the World War. “The
people.” she says, “have many ridicul-
ous ideas about us. They ask such
questions as: “Is it true that all Amer-
ican men chew tobacco; that the Klu
Klux Klan is the strongest force in
America, and that American women
never work?”

“The French are very strict with
their daughters and do not permit
them to see any night life until they
are married,” states Miss Reynolds.
“French men go shopping with their
wives and help choose their clothes.”

At the end of four months Miss Rey-
nolds Went to England to study at
Mr. Gardner’s School in Lauerdale
Mansions on the outskirts of London
in preparation for enrollment at the
University of London. Vvhile there
she stayed at Mr, Gardener’s home. In
answer to a question about the difficul-
ty of understanding the King's Eng-
lish, she said it was only spoken in
and about London. In the country-
side. except in Southern England, they
speak as we do.

A cablegram telling of her father’s
illness brought her home. Once on
American soil, she entered Bloomburg
State Teacher’s College where she
lived at the home of the President and
tutored his two children, This fan
