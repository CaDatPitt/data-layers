fa*Vaccine Program Starts

Second Week Shooting

In a program that started last week and is continuing
through today and tomorrow, University students are re-

ceiving anti-ﬂu shots.

Resident students were given the shots last week, and
all other full-time undergraduate students are gettingtheir
shots this week. These shots will be given as long as the
University’s supply of vaccine lasts.

Dr. Samuel Wishik, professor, of Maternal and Child
Health, has urged all students to take advantage of this pro-
gram. He warns students that “the worst is yet to come” in

the Asian ﬂu epidemic.

4%

Full-Time Students
To Receive Shots

Today, Tomorrow
By LORRAINE LESOON
Approximately 3,500 full-
time students will receive ﬂu
shots today and tomorrow in
the Commons Room from 9

a.m. to 4 p.m., or until the vac—_

cine runs out.

Dr. Lucien Gregg, professor of
medicine and coordinator of pro-
4-fessional services in Falk Clinic
has stated, “The. vaccine could be
given in a more organized manner
on Nov. 20 thru Nov. 23 when the
Polio shots are to be adminis-
tered.
Students Immunized
“However,” adds Dr. Gregg, “we
do not want to sit on the vaccine
in the middle of an epidemic;

. therefore students will be immu-

nized as fast as the Vaccine can
be obtained.”

No appointment is. needed;
those coming first will be vac-
cinated ﬁrst. Students who are

Doctor Expresses
Personal View Of
Asian F In Spread

By l\/IURRAY CHASS
Although Asian ﬂu does
not pose a serious health
threat to students individu-
ally, it could nevertheless

disorganize an entire group -

unless the proper precautions
are taken.

This is the view expressed by
Dr. Samuel M. Wishik, professor
of Maternal and Child Health in
the Graduate School of Public
Health, concerning the latest sick-
ness to hit the nation.

Good Reason

Thus, Dr. Wishik feels, there is

good reason for all students ex-
cept a limited numberto take ad-
vantage of the current anti-ﬂu
program being conducted by the
University.
_ The only students that Dr.
Wishik advises not to take the
shots are those who have a sen‘-
sitivity to egg protein since the
virus of the vaccine is grown on
eggs. _

“The Asian ﬂu has hit the
United States, and some has hit
Pittsburgh,” Dr. Wishik says.

Reach Peak

“The epilemic may reach its
peak later this fall or early win-
ter, and there also may be a sec-
ond wave of the ﬂu in the Spring.”

This is why he suggests that
the students do not ‘pass up this
chance for protecting them-
selves against any future epi-
demic.’ _

Dr. Wishik names four groups
toward which students have a
“loyalty” to keep from contract-
ing the ﬂu.

These are the family, the Uni-
versity, working groups (students
who have part-time jobs), and the;
community in general.

Closed Down

He points out that Washington
and Jefferson College was closed
down for a few days because of
‘numerous illnesses stemming from
the ﬂu. p ‘

And, “Since Pitt is considerably
larger, it would be closed for a

, longer period if the epidemic hits

as expected,” he states.

\“Asian ﬂu hits like an explo-
sion and continues for’ about six
weeks,” Dr. Wishik explains. “A
person would be sick for three,
four or five days.

“If a large group of the popu-

lation is sick at one time, who’s\
going to take care of everyone?”

‘Pitt Chest Drive Begins Today

There It Goes‘  

Undergrads

To Receive

Pledge Kits

To launch the annual Pitt
Chest drive slated for this
week, 6,000 undergraduate
will receive the 1957 Pitt
Chest pledge envelope and
brochure by mail today and

tomorrow.
The envelope

enclosing the

pamphlet is to be used when Pitt v

students make or pledge their
contributions.
Three Choices

Urging students to “read, con-
sider and decide,” the envelope
allows the student to make three
choices: to make his contribution
at the time when he turns in his
envelope, to pledge to contribute
with the next six weeks, or to
refuse to contribute.

' Unless the student turns in
his envelope stating one of these
three choices, he will be con-
tacted by the Pitt Chest Com.
mittee at a future date.

A new feature of this year’s
Chest campaign is the permitting
of the student to name the area
to which he wishes to contribute,

Three ilreas

Although percentage allocations
to three major areas have already
been set with 30% going to Pitt
students, 37% going to other Stu-
dents, and 33% going to commun-
ity services, the Pitt student .will
be afforded the opportunity to
name the speciﬁc area or areas to
which he wishes to donate.

In returning his envelope, the
student is requested to deposit
it at the Student Desk, Ground 0
Floor, Cathedral of Learning,
and is asked to make “careful
consideration of the information
concerning Pitt Chest.”

On Wednesday, Nov. 13, speak-
ers representing the Pitt Chest

T Committee are scheduled to speak

to students for the ﬁrst ten min-
ues of the 10:00 a.m. class.

Aims to Educate A
The speeches will be less edu-
cational in nature since the drive
aims this year to educate the stu-
dents through posters and articles
before they hear the Wednesday
talks.
Chairman of the Speakers .
Committee, Gerry Paulie, Col.
’58, has asked that more stu-
dents volunteer to act as speak-
ers on Nov. 13 since the stu-
dents responding to such re-
quests have been “few in num-
ber.” ‘

Flu Vaccine

To Be Given
All Students

(Continued from Page 1)
not inoculated today or tomor-
row may have a chance to get

‘ the ﬂu shot in the near future.

A quantity of 2,000 cc of the
vaccine is expected to arrive in
succeeding weeks. ‘

Committee Suggests

Members of the ﬂu vaccine
committee strongly suggest that
students be inoculated now, thus
ruling out the possibility of their
missing the shots.

The ﬂu program is not an
auxiliary University project.
Because over 2,000 students
have been stricken, the program
is an attempt by the University
to fulﬁll its health obligations
toward the students as it ful-
ﬁlls academic and social obli-
gations.

Given Shots

Resident students were given
shots ﬁrst because of the danger
of the epidemic spreading even
more.

Part-time students will be in-
noculated as soon as the full-
time students have received shots.

Both those who have or have
not contracted the ﬂu bug are

urged to receive the shot, since
it will immunize them against
another attack.

During the past week students
in the dormitories have been in-
oculated under the direction of
Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of stu-
dent health service for men, and
Dr. Auleene Jamison, director of
student health service for women.

The shots given are‘ for the
Asian Flu. Persons who have had
the Asian Flu should not receive
shots; however, although many
have been stricken with influenza,
it is not certain they have had the
Asian Flu unless cultures have

Men’s Council met Tues-
day, Nov. 5. John Bender
stated that nominations for
Freshmen Class ofﬁcers had
been extended to Friday,
Nov. 8.

Campaigning will begin today
in Men’s Conference classes.

Bill Baldwin reported that the
Constitution for Men’s Court
has" been written. It was re-
ported that Judges should be
elected and that Independent-
representation be mandatory.

1 M. C. has the problem of a
“wet campus” for Pitt under

“wet campus” colleges for infor-
mation on drinking at their cam-
pus. ,

John Bender moved to adopt

retreat appropriation. It was
seconded and passed.

Bob Watford moved that M. C.

been taken.

So it is advisable for all stu-
dents to take advantage of the
flu vaccine.

Dr. Harry Bisel, medidal chair-
man of ' the Health Campaign
committee, was named to take
charge of the program.

Dr. Bisel, assisted by several
doctors and nurses, A will care
for persons receiving shots, thus
insuring maximum safety.

Shot will not be given to stu-
dents under 21 years of age un-
less parental consent forms are
presented.

 

. THE LITTLE SAVEl?

Among America’s great sav-
ers, George T. Coffee is a
legend. One day, George dis-
covered that by going to sleep
with his shoes on, he could
save a full 60 seconds dressing
in the morning. Multiplying
this by 365 days——gave him
over 6 hours saved per year.
Then, multiplying this by 8
years—gave him 48 hours-
or two full days saved! George
was giddy. “Think of it,” he
mused. “Two full days saved
to do anything . . . read,
sleep or go to Europe!”
Another time, George passed
a store that advertised “Save
$50 When You Buy These
$100 Suits!” George imme-
_::.sdiately saw the fantastic op-
portunity . . . realizing that he
could save $100 by not buying
any of these suits. Thereupon,
he proceeded not, to buy ten
suits and rolled up a tidy
$1,000 in a few seconds.
However, the best saving
George ever did by far-—was

when he happened on the
Van Heusen Vantage Shirt.
Vantage is a shirt you don’t

0 have to iron . . . so you save

on laundry bills. Wash it—‘-
hang it up to dry———that’s_a‘ll.
“So what,”\you sneer, “aren’t
there other shirts that can do
the same thing?” “Mebbe,”
we sneer, “but Vantage is a
cotton shirt——with all of cot-
ton’s natural softness, poros-
ity and comfort. And it only
costs $5!"

Men—grab a pencil in your

ﬁst. Figure out your laundry
bill for shirts for a year. Then
ﬁgure out the price for seven
Vantage shirts. You’ll find
that Vantage shirts actually
pay for themselves in the
laundry bills you save! See
you at the bank.
, P.S. You can also save your-
elf the trouble of searching for
lost collar-stays. For Vantage
shirts have Collarite sewn-in
stays which can’t get lost, keep
the collar neat, always.

O
This year’s Pitt Chest drive, which begins today and
will extend through Friday, will attempt to surpass all pre-
vious drives of this nature by soliciting at least $4,000 from
Pitt students.

Last year’s goal of $3,500 was met; this year’s goal can ’

be met. However, it will take increased cooperation on the
part of everyone.

Proceeds from this year’s campaign will be distributed
in the following‘ manner. Pitt students will receive a total
of 30 per cent. Men’s Loan Fund will receive 20 per cent
of this, with the remaining 10 per cent going to Women’s
Loan Fund. , ' _

Thirty—seven per cent is reserved for other students
with 30 per cent of this planned for the World University
Service and seven per cent for the National Scholarship
Service and Fund for Negro Students.

The remaining 33 per cent will go to the Community
Fund. United Fund will receive 30 per cent and CARE three
per cent. .

An innovation in this year’s campaign will allow stu-'
dents to mark on their pledge envelope which organization
they wish their funds to be earmarked for. If contributions’
in any particular area exceed the estimates previously’ plan-
ned for that area a redistribution of the allotments will be
made. 0

With an enrollment ofiover 7,000 full time students and
approximately the same number of part time night people
it certainly would not be out of line to expect contributions
in excess of $5,000. _ ,

The Chest drive, instituted in recent years to relieve
students of the annoyance of being ‘beset upon constantly
by numerous charitable organizations, is the only drive dur-
ing the school year that the student is asked to contrib-
ute to. '

With this thought in mind it surely can’t be too much
of an imposition to dig deep on- one occasion and come up
with no less thana one-dollar bill.

Disbelievers Opposed . . . ‘

Case For Faith

By Harold’ Jacobs

Where is your evidence? Can you prove it?
That’s not even logicall
These are the standard attacks often used
against points of View that we disagree with.
Usually they are in order-since we live in a rea-
sonable world, or at least most of us like to think
so. There is one area of man’s ‘
convictions and actions, how-
ever, which should stand apart
from such attacks. This is the
area of belief, or faith.
There are many skeptics who
‘stand on the pedestal of reason
and continually throw out chal-
lenges to those who - believe in
something——let us say God—— '
without giving a clear-cut pat-
tern of logic ' for such belief.
It has never occurred to them
that perhaps there is an area of human endeavor
where reason cannot operate, where cold logic alone
is inadequate. Their minds make such a possibility

unthinkable. They become the stubborn slaves of.

reason, and the devotion they heap on Lady Reason
makes them almost akin to idol-worshipers.

In matters which pertain to the spiritualaspect
of man, there can be no absolute right or ab-
solute wrong, as William James strongly infers in
his famous work, The Will to Believe. Where the
skeptics (some of them go under the name of log-
ical positivists) make their error is in assuming
that veriﬁable tests can always prove the validity

_ or truth of a proposition. In areas where veriﬁable

proof is unavailable, the proposition is either dis-
carded or discredited. It is fortunate that the world
is not dominated by such misguided thinkers.
Religion Needs No Defense
It is not necessary to prove that God exists, al-
though a great many philosophers have attempted
it. “The question of having moral beliefs at ‘all
or .not having them is decided by our will,” James
contends. If it is conceded that man himself 'is im-
‘perfect, how can his reason be always infallible?
Man’s intellect certainly does not exist apart from
his "being.

and ABeads,” Mulligan was the

grounds that charge lack of proof, have simply
made reason their god. Often they stress the point
that such “blind faith” is an admission of weak-
ness, a sort "of crutch to lean on for those who
are too weak to stand up themselves. Amid re-
peated attempts to convince otherwise, these peo-
ple attack tenaciously to their position.

What fails to sink into their thick skulls is that
there is a realm totally above pure reason where
individuals must make decisions for themselves
according to their will.’ As James so aptly puts it,
“If your heart does not want a world of moral
reality, your head will assuredly never make you
believe in one.” A

Egomaniacs Deny Faith ,
A great number of the world’s egomaniacs have 

denied the validity of faith. Consider Hitler, Stalin,
and now Khrushchev. Tlrere are many others-—

more obscure, less dangerous, but just as insidious, *

in their limited inﬂuence. The ego has become their
god- They become obsessed with their self-right-

eousness. They lose all ability to admit that they

might possibly be wrong, ever. All tact, humility,

and consideration for others is passed off to the ,

winds. There is no such thing as kindness for kind-

ness’ sake, Every action must have some design, _

some half-centered purpose to fulﬁll. If this is the
‘proper attitude toward life, then we have every
right to expect that the results of such thinking
should be good. _

But look at the results: Theories of a superior
race, which the biologists and anthropologists, us-
ing scientiﬁc objectivity, have completely repudi-
ated. Driving of all religion underground, a condi-
tion which did not destroy, but rather enhanced,

the faith of oppressed Hungarians and Poles and?-

I suspect, Russian also. Repercussions which led
to wars, the most devastating futility that man has
created. , '

People who cannot defend their faith by some
objective argument needn’t be ashamed. Those who
do the taunting are certainly worse off. It was the
uncivilized peoples who invented idol-worship.

Who can argue with Samuel Taylor Coleridge in
the Lyrical Ballads when he writes that there are
certain situations which require “a willing sus-
pension of disbelief”?

Rarely has as"

group of jazz
musicians been " “ 
assembled for a concert in Pitts-
burgh as appeared at the Syria
Mosque last ' uesday evening.
Under the dubious banner of
“Jazz for Moderns,” George
Shearing, Gerry Mulligan, Chico
Hamilton, Miles Davis, et al.,
-and the Australian Jazz Quintet
presented their tasty talents. ,A
young vocalist named Helen
Megrill also did her bit, but it

‘_ well could have been left un-

@-

done.
These musicians and their
scores of sidemen, since the ﬁnale
of World War II, have been pur-
veying a commodity known as
“progressive jazz”—a kind of
careful improvisation with Ivy
League blazer and an Oxford
air. Within their own coterie,
there are a Variety of splinter
groups of originality, and it the
Mosque program was designed to
show off some of the best.
Mu||igan's Progressive Style
Slender Gerry Mulligan plays
perhaps the ﬁnest baritone and
tenor sax of its throaty kind.
Aided by Lee Konitz, a facile
alto player, plus bass and drums,
Mulligan proved during his ﬁrst
helf set that his uncompromising
progressive style is still the
truest available. Playing such
tunes as “Lover _Man,” “Bernie’s
Tune,” ‘and “Baubles, Bangles,

  

master of his unpretentious, yet
precise specie of music.

Gerry usually opens the door
to the number himself, sets the
tempo, hints at the melody, and
is off on a cerebral improvisa-
tion. Konitz takes up the task
after the once around. But Mul-
ligan doesn’t loaf during his
break. Instead he stalks rest-
lessly about the stand, watching
his rhythm men, and occasionally
horning in with a strain of well-
placed accompaniment. On
Tuesday, his music was never
dull, never strident, always ex-
pert. The audience was satisﬁed.

The concluding and upbeat half
of the program presented the
polished, if slightly gaudy, com-
bination of Chico Hamilton’s
quintet and the sextet of George
Shearing. These were the tant-
alizers, the headliners, the fa-
miliar names from a_ business
where obscurity is the rule.

The Unorthodox Chico

Chico Hamilton is a drummer
of the “Paciﬁc Coast School,”

who has a penchant for the un-'

orthodox. He has gained ap-
proval for his melodius, swift,
direct interpretations which are
characteristic of California mu-
sicians. With the aid of a pick-

.up combo of sax, guitar, bass,

and cello, Hamilton. opened well
with Ellington’s “Satin Dol1.”

He moved through a dark “My
Funny Valentine” with ease and
ledthe others around a quick
exercise of “Topsy.” Chico clos-
ed on an original solo composi-
tion called, “Mr. Jo Jones
March.” It was a gimmicky bit,
yet well carried out.

Although “inimitable” is a
dangerous word to throw
around, it can -aptly be applied
to George Shearing. If there is a
unique jazz musician alive, it

is this blind English pianist. His .

lush, harmonic arrangements
depend upon a subtle interweav-
ing of the Shearing piano with

sonant bass, and hushed snares.
The result is sinfully easy listen-
ing which has seduced more
record buyers than any other
jazz idiom.

Shearing’s Turn

The Mosque crowd of 2000
was treated to “Lullaby of Bird-
land,” “On the Street Where
You Live,” “A Foggy Day,”
“Ends of the Earth,” and “Cara-
van.” His sidemen are the best
and they heed their canny lead-
er with constant fidelity. In ﬁne,
the audience was Shearing’s
completely. Though hegis com;
mercial for purists, his stature

may warrant it. There is no _

denying his coyness.
The “lead up” artists on the

.bill were the Australian Jazz

Quintet, initially. Their work
cannot be quarreled with. Miss
Merrill got off the stage while
the getting was good, and Miles
Davis followed. His diamond-
hard, horserace-tempo style is
still ahead ‘of its time, but the
hyperkinetic little trumpet man
seems satisﬁed to go his own-
pioneering way.

With such a ﬁne variety of
musicianship, in reasonably good
one-nighter form, the little
dumpy guy might have turned

to his wise friend after the sesule.

sion and noted, “With all the
selection, how could we lose?”
If there were any “losers” pre-
sent in the audience, they were“
close-mouthed. '
The title, “Jazz for Moderns,”
remains ‘a touchy question. It
smacks mildly of motivational
researching. If a hidden motive
is to impute a speciﬁc direction
to the idiom, then the progres-
sive jazz devotee is against it.
The jazz hypothesis is still
evolving, still at odds with it-

Scientists Conduct
Experiments With
Newest Equipment’

_, The lab technicians in the
School of the Health Profes-
sions believe that when their
laboratories are ‘completed,
the University will have one
of the most modern and well
equipped research departments in
the country.

Because of the lack of sufficient
funds, the School of the Health
Professions Building is as yet un-
ﬁnished.

Equipment Purchased

Although most of the equip-
ment has already been purchased,
it is‘ standing in the individual
laboratories waiting to be install-
ed.

In order to save money, the
University has twenty of its
own workmen on the job, in-
stalling the equipment them-
selves.

The seventh and eighth floors
are the research areas where the

newest scientiﬁc methods of ex-
perimentation are being done.
Large Labs

The laboratories which have
been finished, are large, well-
ventilated, and have the most
modern facilities.

Each one, according to the type
of work being done there, is
equipped with vent, waste, gas,
compressed air, and hot and cold
water lines. .

They are designed to conform
to the rules of efficiency and
maximum output, somewhat re-
sembling factory assembly lines.

One of the largest laboratories
is the one which Drs. Lansing and
Rosenthal occupy.

It contains five double work
tables and the equipment with
which they work.

Glass Doors

The spacious wall cabinets, con-
taining an assortment of chemic-
als and instruments, have sliding
glass doors and the metal sinks
are topped with a new hard sub-
stance alberine stone.

In the Microtechnic Lab, on
the eighth floor, technicians
prepare the histology slides for
the freshman lab courses.

complete with graphs and charts,
which regulates the temperature
and humidity of the room.

MountaineersVictorious

In Revenge

Game, 7-6

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The West Virginia Mountaineers dealt a shattering blow
to Panther hopes for a winning season by nailing the crippled
Blue and Gold, 7-6 on Saturday.

Before a shivering and snow—whipped crowd of 48,745,
the visitiors from Morgantown scored late in the ﬁrst quar-
ter and dispritedly hung on during the remainder of the

game to defeat the locals.
Halfback Bill McClure set up
the Hillbilly touchdown with a
44 yard punt run-back along the
sideline to put the ball on the
Sky_scraper’s 6 yard line. It took
three off-tackle smashes to gain
the end zone with Fullback Larry
Krutko scoring from three yards
out, Paul “Whitey” Mikanik boot-
ed the ball against the wind and
through the uprights for the extra

' point. »

Gob Scores

Mikanik, a senior halfback
from Follansbee, W. Va., played
briefly for Pitt as a freshman sev-
eral years ago. He dropped out of
school to enter the service and
subsequently enrolled at West
Virginia University. His point,
eighth out of twelve attempts this
year, beat his former mates and

wadded the barb of irony to his

homestaters’ glee.

The golden-suited Ridgerun-
ners held the Panthers score-
less throughout the ﬁrst half
and for 10 minutes of the third
stanza. Then, from the local’s
49 yard line, Quarterback Ivan
Toncic uncorked a looping pass
to End Art Gob at the Moun-‘
taineer 18. Gob was alone by
the sideline and outraced two
ill-positioned Hillbillies.

Toncic, unhappily, did not ﬁnd
the wind as easy to cope with as
did Mikanik. Kicking with. the
gale, Toncic found his boot veer-
ing off course and not good. The
rushing of Mountaineer halfbacks
Pay Peterson and Ralph Anasta-
sio did not expedite the play,
either.

Panthers Stop Drives

The numbing cold and sweeping
wind accounted for 11 fumbles,
six of them by the Panthers. The
Mountaineers lost all of their ﬁve
bobloles, however. This inability
to control the ball resulted in a

game which resembled the old

parlor game of “I don’t want it,
you can have it.” Neither team
could capitalize on the recoveries
and mostof the skirmishing took

Olson’s Thinclads
Beat West Virginia
By Perfect Score.

Last Tuesday, Coach Carl O1-
son’s thinclads defeated a prev-
iously undefeated team from West
Virginia University ov e r the
Schenley Park Course by the per-
fect score of 15-45.

West Virginia coached by Stan
Romanoski came to‘ town with an
unblemished record of seven con-
secutive wins this season. During
this streak of seven straight, West
Virginia had ended Geneva’s run
of 19 consecutive meet wins. The
W.V.U. team had no outstanding
star but good team balance.

The Panthers were still short
one of their top men, Vince
Timon, but the rest of the team
came through in splendid fash-
ion and quite handily.

Ron Rush, George Walters, and
John Christolf shared a three-way
tie for ﬁrst place in the good time
of 24:30.5 considering it had rain-
ed all day and was coming down
in buckets throughout the entire
race. _ _

Did anybody get hit on the head?

the meet was Vince Woyner com-
ing in fourth and Sam Grisciotti

ninth. and tenth respectively.

place between the opposing 40

yard lines. ,

An indication of the tedious
proceedings to come manifested
itself early ill the initial quar-
ter. The Mountaineers took the
opening kickoff and ground out
17' plays before ‘halting half-
heartedly at the locals’ 16 yard
line] .

The Panthers’ best opportunity
to score occurred in the second
period as Bob Stark and Jim
Theodore led the Blue and Gold
from their own 38 down to the
one foot line. Quarterback Bill
Kaliden cou1dn’t negotiate that
distance on fourth down and the
Mounties took over. Conceivably,
that frustration had a fatal effect.

Booters Winning Streak Ended
With Decision Going To Navy

By JIM LACEY
A hard-charging, and accurate—passing Navy soccer team

handed the Panthers their ﬁrst

loss of the season when they

defeated the Booters at Annapolis last Saturday morning by

a 4-1 count.

The Panthers swarmed over the Navy end of the ﬁeld
early in the ﬁrst period. During this time the Jungle Cats

missed numerous scoring opor-6
tunities. Pete Karavellis kicked
one that rolled wide by a matter
of inches.
After this, Glenn Warner’s
re-grouped and began
their offense. Mike Woodbury
got the ﬁrst Npvy goal at the
16 minute mark of the ﬁrst per-
iod. He tipped in a pass from
Dick Abington; one. that goalie
Ron Goga had no chance to
stop.

The sailors increased their lead
midway in the second period when
John Meehan added a goal on a
penalty shot. The Panthers were
penalized for use of hands.“

After half time the men from
Annapolis added another marker
on an odd play. Karl Ripplemey-
er scored the freak goal on a shot

that Goga had stopped. The ball
was not ﬁrmly in his grasp as the
alert Ripplemeyer kicked it away
from him into an open net.
Ripplemeyer added the Mid-
shipmen’s last goal in the fourth
period. It came after Zeke Zari-
quiey’s shot was saved by Paul
Ciancutti, but he’couldn’t hold
the rebound. Ripplemeyer bang-
ed it over the prone Ciancutti.

Jerry Bresanelli averted a shut-
out when he beat goalie S a in
Parker with a hard kick from 35
feet out. Jason Shrinsky passed to
Bresanelli for the assist.

Panthers Have
Long Season

By ED KOLTISKA

Sports Editor

 

With another loss added to the record over the weekend, the
Panthers now have a 3-5 slate. After four straight defeats, it looks

_ as if the Panthers will not come out of the nose dive that started with

the Army tilt. Two more tough opponents remain on the Jungle Cat
schedule. Keystone rival Penn State will be at the Stadium in two
weeks and then the Blue and Gold will travel to Miami on December
7 for their television ﬁnale.

So far it has been a long season for the Panthres. In fact, every

V game seems to be a long one especially when you are losing. In the

last three tilts the games could have gone either way. They were all
won by the toe. In the Notre Dame game it was an extra point while
the Syracuse contest a field goal did the trick. This past week, West
Virginia did it with an extra point to avenge their one point loss to
the Panthers last year. .

There was only onechange in events this past week. Instead
of a long pass putting the Panthers in the hole, it was a runback
of a punt. Bill McClure took Fred Riddle’s punt on the 50-yard line
and ran it down the right sideline to the Panther six yard line be-
fore being knocked down by Don Crafton. It looked as if’ McClure
might have been trapped around the 45 yard marker, but he faked
the end out of position and got to his outside for the long return. '

But the Panthers also had many breaks this ‘game; something

‘ they have not had in their previous games. They recovered, ﬁve of

West Virginia’s fumbles a few of which were in the middle of Moun-
taineer drives. They also had the only pass interception in the game
as Riddle intercepted on his goal line with ten seconds remaining in
the half.

The Jungle Cats are again having jitters within the twenty yard
line. Early in the second quarter the Locals moved the ball from their
own 38 to the Mountaineer one before giving up the ball on the goal
line. , - ..

The Panthers have been able to score from within the twenty
only in two ball games, namely Southern California and Notre
Dame. Otherwise the scoring has come on long passes, long runs,
and blocked punts.

Perhaps Coach John Michelosen had an idea that this would not
be—- a winning season. Prior to the season’s opener, Michelosen
claimed that the reserve strength wasn’t deep enough and that the
opposition was exceptionally tough this year. So far this statement has
come true. _ i

One thing that he didn’t bargain on was the number of injuries
that would plague the team. For the past ﬁve weeks, the Panthers
have been fortunate to have two complete backﬁelds available for
practice. Normally there are at least four available. The line has
also had the same problems. Saturdays lineup had four reserves
starting in the line. Joe Pulllekines, Ken Montanari, Don Crafton, and
Bill Lindner got the nod."

With next week free, the Panthers will at least have time to_
possibly heal their wounds and get the much needed rest necessary
to play the type of schedule that Captain Tom Hamilton sets up year
after year.

Freshmen End Season;

Down Kent State, 44+-O

L By LARRY HAGGERTY

The Blue and Gold frosh rambled to an easy 44-0 victory
over the Kent State gridders last Thursday night at Kent,
Ohio. An estimated crowd of 700 saw the Panthers dominate
the game and score their second consecutive shut out.

It was the ﬁnal game for both teams and gave Coach

Steve’Petro’s Panther cubs a 2-2 record for the season. The
yearlings closed the season with: ‘
two consecutive triumphs over‘
West Virginia and Kent after
losses to Penn State and Navy.

~¢-Quarterback Ed Scharockman
paced Skyscraper U. by scoring
three toucrdowns and passed 25
yards to Chuck Reinhold of Mt.
Lebanon for another tally. Rein-
hold also ran eight yards to
paydirt.

Two members of the vastly im-
proved second unit scored the
ﬁnal markers for the Cubs. Half-_
backs Ray - Tarasi of Oakmont
High fame, and another promis-
ing newcomer, Darwin Schmidt,
each scored on plunges from in-
side theﬁve.

The Panthers were in control of
the encounter from the opening
kickoff. The rock—ribbed defensive
line contained the Kent attack‘ so
thoroughly that the lads from
Akron only penetrated Panther

“If we could only play Penn
State and Navy again,” stated
Petro in the dressing room fol-
lowing the tilt. This is the best re-
cord that the Blue and Gold year-
lings have come up with since
the 1953 season.

The Panthers were able to over-
come early injuries and an out-
break of the Asian flu to go on to
win their ﬁnal two games. “Scha-
rockman, Reinhold, John Sakal,
Mike Ditka, Richard Maytus, and
many others stood out all season
long,” said Petro.

“It would be safer for that
person to wait a week and then
get it. Also, anyone who has had
ﬂu (not of the Asian variety) in
the past month should get the
shot.

“There are no great ill effects

dents may have a sore arm or feel
below par for a few hours after
getting the shot, but nothing worse
than that.”

“Only Now”

Dr. Wishik explained why the
anti-ﬂu program wasn’t set up be-
fore this. “Only now has the Uni-
versity" acquired any amount of
vaccine necessary to inoculate the
entire student body.

“This is the ﬁrst time this
type of ﬂu has been known in
the world, the ﬁrst time it has
been identiﬁed.

“Actually this is the ﬁrst time
that a nation has anticipated an
epidemic. The worst is yet to
come.”

CONTINUOUS—Maintenance of the Cathedral’s eight eleva-
tors is a never-ending job. Each elevator has eight cables, each one
being strong enough to support a fully-loaded car. Besides these, a
safety cable, governed by the speed of the elevator, acts as a brake
if the cables would snap. The elevator can fall no more than four
feet before the instantaneous _action of the automobile brakes stops
descent. The workers in the picture are changing door motors which
open -constantly throughout the day. A
