Men ls Fraternities Open
Three Day Rushing W/eei< 

Mid-year three-day rushing pro-
gram began yesterday morning at
8:30 o’clock as 12 men’s i’ratern_ities
began to e.nterta.in new freshmen
and upper classmen.

Fraternity men have been cau-

‘ tioned by the office of the dean of
men not to violate the rushing and
initiation rules_which have been
issued to each fraternity house,
jointly announced Roy H. Umble,
assistant to the dean of men and

Dick Mansﬁeld, E42, lF Council

president.

The rushing regulations prohib-
it any rushees from staying at the
house of a fraternity member or
pledge or at any fraternity house
over night.

All contact with new students
ended last night at I0:30 o’clock.
Rushing activities will continue to-
day and tomorrow.

The rules allowonly one mixed
social event. This event will take
place tomorrow night in all houses.

At 2 o'clock Sunday morniiiz,

the silence or bidding period be-
gins. During this period, extending
until 5 o'clock next Thursday, no
fraternity member or pledge may
communicate with any newly-reg-
istered student.

Fraternities will issue bids for
students and these will be accepted
by rushees through the dean of
men’s oﬂice.

After 5 o’clock next Thursday,
no newly-registered student may be
pledged or invited to pledgeship
for one month. i

independent Members of SFA Resign;
Protest Killing of 'Equaiity'Amendment

3 s. F. AYE_RS
yHiram Milton, C42, and ﬁve 1"‘

dependents announced their resig-
nation from SFA as the aftermath
of a bitter inter-party struggle
over equal representation Wednes-
day night.

pa, E43; resigned their assembly
posts with Milton in protest Over
what they termed the “disgraceful
act” of the assembly in refusing to
allow a student plebiscite on the
Independents’ equal reP3'e5e“tatl°“
amendment before April 1, date of
the regular SFA elections.
The Independents’ action came
more than an hour after a consti-

plan providing for an equal dis-
tribution of 32 students seats be-
tween Independents and fraternity
men.
Under the plan, fraternities
would choose their 16 representa-

tives, and Independents, meeting in .

caucus, would do likewise.
Thus, SFA elections, instead of

being inter-party affairs would
theoretically become intra—party
struggles.

This freedom from inter-bloc
politics was the main argument
of Independent leaders.

Ihe proposed amendment was
defeated by a straight party vote
of 19-6.

At this point, Milton introduced
a petition, signed by 500 students,
asking for, a plebiscite on the

constitution, fraternity leaders
proceeded to work on the “money-
saving” theory of holding the pleb-
scite and SFA elections on the
same date.

Independents pointed out that
if the proposal to hold the elec-
tions simultaneously were adopted,
and the amendment was approved,
SFA would be frustrating student
opinion for one year, and warned
that such action would not only
be unethical but “disgraceful.”

When the “money-saving" pro-
posal passed, Milton and his co-
horts announced their resignation;

  TRIMESTER PLAN  

The University has ﬁnally and officially adopted 

trimester acceleration program.

Provost Rufus H. F itzgcrald, in announcing the ad ,
tion of the extra-summer program, stressed the fact that the 

regular Summer Session would be held as always, right
along with the accelerated program. a 2

Further, prospective freshmen (high school
may cut off more than a year by attending the extra-siitk _

mcr sessions.

means that students in three-,.;
schools——Enginccring, the College, and Business Adininisi-,
tration—may attend the summer session and thus adv

seniors)

The extra-summer‘ session will work as follow-.91?

Upper-classmen (those beyond the ﬁrst semester of their _
freshman year) in the College and the School of Business Ad‘-‘- 3

ministration will ﬁnish the second semester of the 1941-42-

school year on May 23.

If they return for the extra-summer session these stun ;
dents will have recess for one month. They will register for.
the summer trimester on June 25, 26, 27. Classes will begin;
June 29. The summer trimester will continue from June 25 .,

to September 16, and will be '12 weeks in length.

Organization of classes

There will be distinct changes in the hour-length of classes, and 

the sequence of course study.

Classes

All ‘classes will be one hour and a half long. This is only for the
week College and Bus’ Ad courses. Further subdivision of this hour and 

in 12 week period

a half class period with respect to rest periods has not been released.

The number of meetings per week of a class will depend, as now 

upon the number of credits which the course carries.

0

Courses

The aim of the extra-hummer

session will he to cover a full year’;

work in a few subjects, rather than

a semester's work in a larger num-
ber of subjects.

For instance a student will take
both Poli Sci 1 and 2 during the
summer trimester instead of tak-

ing Poli Sci 1 during the summer .

trimester and then taking Poli Sci
2 in the fall-trimester.

How this sequence change will
apply to advanced one semester
courses has not been fully explain-
ed; what the ‘normal number of
credits to be carried during the
summer trimester will be has not
been revealed. V

The program of the extra-sum-
mer session of the School of En-
gineering differs in several respects
from the program for the College
and the School of Business Ad-
ministration outlined above.
Upperclassmen (those beyond
the ﬁrst semester of the freshmom
year), in the School of Engineer-
my:
will finish the second semester
of their 1941-42 school year on
May 23.
will register earlier than others
attending the summer trimester.
They will register on June 3 and 4.
Classes will begin June 5 and con-
tinue until September 16. Thus the
summer trimester for engineers
will be 16 weeks long, compared
to 12 weeks for others.

Organization of classes in
the 16 week period

Engineering classes will be one
hour long, just as they are now.
The number of class meetings per
week will depend upon the number
of credits which the course carries.

Non-engineering courses, such
as accounting courses, which are
required of certain engineers, will
be scheduled for engineers-only in
one hour classes, so that there will
be no conflict between the hour
classes and the hour and a" half
classes.

Courses

It does not appear that there will
be any change in the sequence of
courses for engineers. as tlicrc will
be for n0n—r:‘-ngineers.

Owl Adopts New
Payment Plan

Although the 1942 Owl under-
graduate sales campaign ends to-
day, a deferred payment plan that
will permit students to make the
deposit on the yearbook until Fri-
day of next week will begin.

“Students who wish to purchase
ﬁne 1942 yearbook but who are
unable to make the $1 down pay-
ment today should reserve a. copy
and make the payment before Fri-
day of next week,” Don Lingen-
felter, BA44, assistant circulation
manager, said.

Undergraduates may make the
$1 down payment on the $3.50 to-
tal price or they may reserve a copy
and make the payment next week
directly with one of the 32' sales-
men, in the Owl office, 803 Cathe-
dral, or at the table in the ground
ﬂoor elevator lobby.

John Brosky, C42, editor, said
that this move was taken to assure
all students a fair opportunity to
purchase the yearbook which may
be the last one to be put out by
the University until the end of the
war.

 

Trimester . . .

continued from page one
tration starting with a 12 weeks
summer trimester. .

Freshmen engineers may sched-
ule the work of a whole’ semester,
except for ROTC or physical edu-
cation, and General Engineering 1.

In this respect, their courses will
be an exception to the other enter-
ing freshmen who will study for a
whole year’s work.

Registration for all new fresh-
men is scheduled for June 25, 26,
and 27. Classes will begin June 29
and will extend until September 16.

Trustees

To make the trimester program
completely official it must be ap-
proved by the trustees. It is ex-
pected that they will do so without
hesitation at the March meeting of
the Board of '1‘:-ustees.

ROTC
The military department plans
for the summer have notbeen re-

leased.

Finances ,

The sudden announcement of the
adoption of the trimester plan
leads to the possibility that deﬁnite
word has come from Washington
that ﬁnancial assistance will be
forthcoming in the future.

The Future

University officials are meeting
now to discuss plans for extension
of the trimester system to other
schools of the University.

More deﬁnite statements on the
number of credits to be carried
during the summer, class hour
schedules, courses to be offered,
etc., will probably be made in the

_ near future.
