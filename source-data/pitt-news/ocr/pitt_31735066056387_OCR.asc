Environmentalists accuse O’Connor of ignoring concerns I

   

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News

SEAC member Michael Kaizar is carried out of the Chancellor's office after sitting in for over 6 hours yesterday to
protest Pitt's possible involvement in the Mt. Graham telescope project.

_ By Scott Carpel
Staff Writer

After sitting in Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s office for over six hours

protesting the University of Pittsburgh’s‘

possible involvement in the Mount
Graham Telescope Project, six students
were carried out by campus police and
issued deﬁant trespass citations.

Protesters arrived at the chancellor’s
office at 10:10 a.m. yesterday asking for
O’Connor to come out and meet with
them to discuss the University of Arizona
telescope project Pitt has been looking
into for over a year.

“We’re acting in defense of religious
freedom. We will not allow our university

" to use our tuition for this project,” Student

Environmental Action Coalition protestor
Sarah Kraemer screamed as she was
removed from the office.

But O’Connor said no decision has
been made. “People have asked us to
change our mind and since~our mind is
not made up, I don’t quite know how to
interpret that phrase,” O’Connor said.

As students were removed from the
office there was only verbal resistance.

“This action is not only for ourselves,
but for students of this university, inhabi-
tants of Mount Graham, 15 endangered
species  SEAC member Olivia Kissel
said.

When all of the protesters were
removed from the office, they began
chanting “Chancellor, chancellor, keep
Pitt off Mount Graham.”

The project, according to SEAC, would
cost the university $15 million and would
impact a very sensitive group of ecosys-
tems as well as invade an area that is

sacred to the San Carlos Apache people.

O’Connor said he is aware of ‘the envi-

ronmental concerns SEAC has and that
the administration is considering those
concerns along with all other aspects of
the project in the vast “array of informa-
tion” they have to consider before mak-
ing any final decision.

The protesters wanted to speak to uni-

versity officials including: O’Connor,
Senior Vice-Chancellor of Business and
Finance Ben Tuchi and Department Head - .
of Physics and Astronomy James Maher.

Protesters vowed not to leave the office

T ake 2/falnables bomefor the holidays,

By Karen Ferry
Staff Writer

Imagine coming back to
school after a relaxing holiday
only to find your room broken
into and all of your valuables
gone. '

Assistant Director of Public
Safety Gary Moses advises stu-
dents that “when they leave for

home, take stereos, TV’s, CD’s,
computers, jewelry and all
money and credit cards.”

He said that when residence

I hall rooms are broken into,

those items are what are most
frequently taken.

“You can leave your clothes
and linens, but take home your
valuables.”

They don’t take up much

room and they can fit in the
trunk of a car, so you don’t
have to make any special trans-
portation arrangements to get
them home, according to
Moses.

Also, students living in resi-
dence halls should be sure to
lock their doors.

“You’d be surprised how
many doors are unlocked when

saypolice

our officers check them.” Moses
said a lot of times when there is
more than one person living in
a room, people think their
roommates have locked the
door

There were no break in inci-
dents over the Thanksgiving
break, and Moses said he hopes
there won’t be any break ins
over the holiday break.

Dreaming, solitz/w.lehel,I) sattain a peaceful 950.7/ll

Sometimes I tell myself that
if I had a chance to relive my
life I would like to do it as an
extrovert.Extroverts, at least
from an intorvert’s point of
view, seem to have so much
more fun. They are comfort-
able in all kinds of social situa-
tions, are full of chatter and
gregarious enthusiasm and
they never seem to tire of peo-
ple contact. Those of us who
are more introverted do enjoy
many social situations, but it
doesn’t come easy, and after a
certain amount of socializing,
we usually have to find our-
selves a quiet spot to get emo-
tionally “refueled.”

This need for periods of soli-
tude, however, has its beneﬁ-
cial aspects and it is probably
the one area where introverts
have something to teach their
more extroverted friends.

Sometimes, socially-outgo-
ing students enjoy and need
Contact with others so much
that they rarely find time to be
alone. If they do find them-
selves alone they are likely to

turn on the television or stereo
for company.

external noise, and with all the

time each week and use this
time to think about what you

from the wants of your parents

once iii our minds and once in
reality. We need to think
things and dream things
before we can make them
happen.

.The important message in all
of this is that to create a rich
and meaningful life for our-
selves we need to take time
for self—analysis and reflection.

It’s not easy to do because
we are pulled so many differ-
ent ways but if we can include
some creative solitude in our
lives, our understanding of
ourselves and others will grow
and our lives will be richer for
the effort. '

CGSlplaI1Si  
to honor
graduates
at newly
formatted
ceremony

By Lisa DiMeno
Staff‘ Writer

Another semester is coming to
an end and it is once again time
for the College of General
Studies Student Government
Council to honor graduating
CGS seniors with a dinner and
ceremony.

The event will take place on
Monday, Dec.,20,‘at 6 p.m. in
the William Pitt Union Ballroom.

Every year the council spon-
sors the dinner at the end of
each semester as a commenda-
tion of graduating CGS students.
The council changed the format
of the dinner this past summer
and transformed it into more of
a ceremony.The council voted
to purchase caps and gowns for
the graduates to wear as their
names, majors and any hon-
orary affiliation they might have
are announced. I

 

GPSA creates new course evaluation format

By Karen Ferry
Staff Writer

Graduate students will not
only have ‘a chance _to evalu-
ate faculty membersnext
semester, but they will make
up the questions used in the
evaluations.

The Graduate and
Professional Student
Association (GPSA) will dis-
tribute surveys for graduate
students. All Graduate
Student Organizations

. (GSO’s) are going to submit

the questions they would
like to see on the forms.

From there, “we will then
collect, redispurse it [results]
and makeiit available for
graduate students,” said
GPSA President Steve Parks
at last night’s GPSA meeting.

The purpose behind the
evaluations is “graduate stu-
dents feel they ‘don’t have a
way of responding to gradu-
ate student teaching.

"This will give graduate
students a form to state how
graduate education is going,”
Parks said.

“This is not a chance to
badmouth issues, it’s a
chance to speak about

issues. We won’t let that
happen.

"Most people realize that
there is a need to address
structural issues,” Parks said.

Along with opening com-
munication through evalua-
tions, GPSA is hoping to
increase communication
within their organization by
enforcing-an attendance pol-
icy.

GPSA'members voted to
enforce the attendance poli-
cy stated in their constitu-
tion. The policy states that
after a school has “missed
two meetings, they are sent a
warning. If they don’t show
up again, their funding is
frozen and they must appeal
to regain it,” said Sidore.

It was agreed that the three
schools lacking in atten-
dance this yearwill receive
notices that this‘ policy will
be going into effect.The

effected schools are the

School of Library and
Information Science, the
School of Public Health and
the School of Nursing.

In other business:

-The Budget and Finance
Committee submitted a pro-
posal for new budget and

finance policies to Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harmon.

GPSA Business Manager
David Sidore said Harmon
gave his OK on the proposal.

GPSA representa-
tives are to take it back to
their GSO’s to discuss it,
make changes and iron out
details for the next meeting.

Sidore said they hope to be
able to vote on the proposal
by the January meeting.

-The Programming
Committee has planned an
ice skating party for graduate
students.

“We try to have one event
each ﬁiomh,” Chair of the
Programming Committee
Mike Rice said. The ice skat-
ing party will be held at
Schenley Ice Rink from 9:30
to 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday
Jan. 25. Admission will be
free with graduate ID, and $3
for all non—graduate stu-
dents. ‘

“We worked out a deal
with the ice rink that we’ll
have a party room and an
alcohol permit for two
hours,” Rice said.

OGPSA has hired an editor

for the Twin Step. Currently,

the Twin Step takes the form
of a newsletter, but begin-
ning in January, it will
become a larger publication.

Elisabeth Preston, a Ph.D.
student in GSPIA has been
chosen as the new editor in
chief of the paper. She said
she has high hopes for the
Twin Step.

“Hopefully, it will be an
eight—page newsprint
tabloid-size paper coming
out once a month,” she said.

Preston said she “envisions
it to have some of the same
stuff that the old Twin Step
had in terms of information,
but hopefully it will be more
lively and politically charged
in terms of graduate-student
issues.

"It will also have entertain-
ment stuff for people new to
the area, and ways to meet
people.” :57‘ '

The first issue is due out
around Jan. 18 and the GPSA
plans to have 14 or 15 drop-
off points across campusto
make sure students get it.
“Ideally, we’d like to drop it
off next to school mailboxes
so everyone will see it,”

’ Student Advocate Mark Smith

said.

The council said it received a
lot of positive feedback from
those who attended the ceremo-
ny and dinner on Aug. 17.

A graduating senior will also
be speaking at the event. This
semester the speaker will be
Joseph Alfonsi. Alfonsi, who
will graduate this semester with
a degree in accounting, is the

until they spoke to them about
the university’s involvement in
the project.

A concensus among the pro-

S testers was that they said they

were still upset with the fact
that O’Connor has not spoken
to them all year.

But O’Connor said he met
with members of SEAC a few

 months ago and that the group

has been very good about get.-
ting him their information about
Mt. Graham through faxing or

. mailing it. .

SEAC members‘ still contend
the chancellor has not listened

ments [all year], while animals

are dying and trees are :dying,’’. ' 5 _  _  _

Kraemer_said. _ . ..
Shortly after the protest
began,, approximately at 10:26
a.m., the Chancellor met with
SEAC President Matt Peters.
At 10:32 a.m. Peters returned
to the reception area and

announced to his group that it

“doesn’t look like ‘we’re going
to be included in the'decision-

«. decision

making process.”

“I spoke with Matt [Peters]
and tried to explain to him
where we were in our decision-
making process and that appar-
ently is inefficient to him- and
that’s unfortunate,” O’Con’nor
said.

While meeting with Peters,
the chancellor accepted a peti-
tion which included signatures
from students, faculty and alum-
ni against Pitt becoming
involved with the Mt.Graham
project. »

O’Connor emphasized that no
regarding Pitt_.’s
involvement has been made.
“We’re continuing to examine

and explore alternatives in ’

cellor said he does not deal
with demands, only facts and
data processes.

At approximately 10:45 a.m.
university police, dressed in
plain clothes, stood outside the
Chancellor’s office.

Although only a few students
were at the actual protest, news
of the event traveled to support-
ers throughout the country.
Between 12 to 15 messages
were taken by the Chancellor’s
receptionist from supporting

-students from the Community

College of Allegheny County,
Michigan State University and
the University of Arizona.

“We’re working for every-
body in -the spirit of those _who
have died in this cause  for the
preservation of the planet, for
future generations because we
don’t inherit the earth from our
parents, we borrow it from our
children,” Kraemer said.

Peters said he Saw “this as an
issue that goes beyond Mount
Graham. It involves all student
groups.”

At 3:40 p.m. Campus Police
sealed off the entrance to the
Chancellor’s office.

According to Walter Waters,
interim director of Public Safety,
the only reason for this is
because “it is a protest. We have
no idea which way the protest
will go. It’s just a precaution.”

At—5 p.m. three uniformed
campus police officers entered
the office. At 5:04 p.m. two
more officers entered the build-
ing. By 5:22 p.m. police began
carrying out protestor, one at a
time.

At 5:45 p.m. the protest had
been subdued,,,The_ group cir-
cled and said a prayer, thanking
supporters and praying for the
chancellor. -

They then let out a howl,
resembling the call of a wild
animal. Soon after the protesters
dispersed.

“I think [the sit-in] was an
ineffective and non-productive
step,” O’Connor said.

But he said he was not sur-
prised by the protest that inhab-
ited his office since members of
the group have been coming
into the office for the past sever-
al days. _

The .chancellor Said he has no

‘intention of dealing with the

group any further in regards to
the Mt. Graham issue. .

Don't sneozle one by

Yesterday, six students were carried out of Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s office ‘and given tres-
passing violations. They had occupied his office for
over six hours to protest the Mount Graham telescope
project. ‘

They were trying to persuade the administration to

avoid involving Pitt in the project. O’Connor said that

no decision had yet been made as .to whether or not
Pitt was going to have any involvement in the project.
“We’re continuing to examine and explore "alterna-
tives in astronomy,” O’Connor told the protesters.
The protestors called for immediate action because
on Monday 200-250 trees were cut down on Mt.

Graham. They took this as a sign that Pitt was about to.‘

make a definite commitment to the project.

The controversy surrounding this project stems from
two issues. The first is that the telescope is to be built
on land that is sacred to the Apache Indian tribe of
San Carlos, in Arizona. _

The the second issue is that the land that the tele-
scope is to be built on is also home to a species of red
squirrel which the Student Environmental Action
Coalition and other national environmental groups say
cannot survive if the ‘telescope is built.

This claim is "disputed by many, and the U.S. forest
service has given permission to begin construction on
the peak. The U.S. Game and Wildlife Service has
required the,University of Arizona to spend $100,000 a
year for the next ten years‘ to study the red squirrel
and how to protect’ it. ' ‘

Chancellor O’Connor said that the administration was
considering these factors in making their decision. The
Chancellor says -that he has. met with SEAC and that
they have provided him with information by mailing
or faxing it to him. .

He. has also accepted a petition from students in a
meeting with the Student Environmental Action
Coalition president. However, Chancellor O’Connor
said that he does not have plans to deal with the

“grioup‘anymore' over concerns about Mount Graham,

It is important that student groups be allowed. to
have a voice and provide. information directly to those
concerned when -decisions like this are to be made.

‘The, Student Environmental Action Committee esti-

mates ‘the project will cost about 15 million dollars.
When a large portion of this money comes from the
students, they should be informed by those making
the decisions about the issues.

The administration should not decide this issue dur— .

ing the break; If the students are off campus when this
decision is made, it will be easy for the administration
to avoid publicity over the issue. _

- No matter what the decision is, it should be made
while students are around and can respond immedi-
ately to it. 0 I

LETTERS

Allegations against Golden, unfounded

After reading David W.
Matta’s column in The Pitt News
I was left with a number of
questions. First, he states that
“the only parties who seem to
care about this affair are 
[SGB] President Jacob and the
members of the present board
who lost their bids for next
year’s presidency.”

Now, I can’t possibly fit into
these categories. I am neither a
current board member nor did
I run for president. The only
conclusion I can draw is that
Matta had some ulterior motive
for defarning me in such a non-
factual manner.

Second, Matta lists three
complaints about my conduct
during the campaign. The first
says, “Early in the campaign [I]

complained about ticket. viola-
tions committed by the ‘Equal’

choice for equal voice’ ticket”.If
Matta had taken the time to
read The Pitt News article that
he is talking about, he would
have found that only comment
was to ask for clarification on

the slating rules.

His second complaint is
“Next there’s an ad in the
paper endorsing you for board,
paid for by the Dental Science
Club. Now, you never really
officially got that endorsement,
though the president  is a fra-
ternity brother of yours. I’ve
been told that you, not_ the
club, paid for the ad.’? Again, if
Matta had looked into this mat-
ter, he would have found two
important things.

First, the protest was filed
and signed by a ‘candidate on

Ross Pasquale’s slate. and one

of his fraternity brothers.
Second, the Elections
Committee held a hearing on
this matter as a result of the

protest. The committee found,

no indication of wrong doing.

Meaning the endorsement was-.

officially given and paid for by
the club. I

.Matta’s last complaint is “[1]
was also seen during the cam-
paign ripping down posters
that had been hung by  the

Matta dismisses journalistic standards

This letter of amusement responds to the
“Point”—”Counterpoint” article regarding the

Pasquale election violation.

My dear Mr. Matta, I have returned to “real”
life; it is time for you to find one 
not in “real-life” journalism, considering your
choice of sources: I quote gems like “I’ve been
told  or “You were seen 
journalistic standards you possess; oops, you
”work_fo‘r The Pitt News.
As for your feeb1e—minded efforts to embarrass
me: You say that because I ‘‘lost big time,” I am
incapable of judging the ethics of someone else.
I fail to see the correlation between a person’s
electoral success and his/her credibility and

ethics.

” — what high

other candidates for board.” If
he had investigated this, he
would have found that no
protest was filed relating to
tearing down posters.
' If Matta had discussed his
concerns with me, before slan-
dering me in this completely
false manner, he would have
foundtthat I am a staunch
believer in the rules. A
I made it explicitly clear that
no one on my staff or in any
way associated with myself

was to violate the elections —

code. If I had,’"I would expect
myself to be disqualified, just
as any other candidate would
be.

I would also hope every
other candidate maintained this
high level of integrity. Lastly, I
question Mr. Matta’s objectivity
in the light of the fact that he is

a staunch supporter of the

“Equal voice” slate, as well as a
fraternity brother of one of -the

“Equal voice” members.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, Decem_l_)er 9, 1993

 

X-mas is $-mas for
Hollywood. But it’s also a good
time for filmgoers. We get a
view of the industry’s big feel-
good Hicks, and better yet, the
practice of sneaking in what the
studios consider their best artis-
tic achievements before the
new year so as to garner Oscar
nominations this spring is wide-
spread on X-mas. This year
almost 50 ﬂicks (though far less
will make it to the ‘burgh) will
ﬂood the screens of America
during the holiday season.
Release dates are national so
don’t call us if these films take

.their sweet time gettin’l here.

As true cinephiles we wish for
a pass to see them all, but since
we’ve been naughty this year
our chances seem kinda slim.
And because nobody has the
time or cash, here’s a list of
what looks like the most inter-
esting fare we’ve seen or heard

about so as to keep you from _

wasting too much of your time
and money in pursuit of that
cinematic bliss over the holi-
days:

Philadelphia — this is
Hollywood’s first assault on
AIDS and it may be a truly legit-
imate one. With Tom Hanks as
a lawyer stricken by more than
the virus when he’s fired from
his firm after they learn of his
condition, the focus is on
groundless discrimination.
Denzel Washington ironically
stars opposite as Hanks’s homo-
phobic lawyer. An all-star sup-
porting cast should give this
drama some cinematic as well
as box office weight.
(December 22)

Heaven and Earth —— Heaven
completes Oliver Stone’s
Vietnam trilogy with a story
about Le Ly, a South
Vietnamese woman whose
experience spans the 20th-cen-
tury wars in Indochina and
eventually leads her to a new
life in America. Tommy Lee
Jones adds some punch to this
epic look at the victims of some
very complex and devastating
levels:of violence. (December

MS LUM.

-A couple of years back in
the College of Fine Arts at
Carnegie Mellon University, the
seed was planted. The roots
took hold in the Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport.
And it took the environment of
New York City for that seed of
an idea to grow into Ms. Lum,
one of the latest musical exports
from the city that gave us Statue
of Liberty thermometers and
bonsai trees shaped like the
Chrysler Building.

From its genesis in the airport,

Ms. Lum proceeded to make
some four track recordings in a
loft in Tribeca. Brian Doherty,
the drummer for They Might Be
Giants, produced these in addi-
tion to producing the band’s
debut full length album release,
Airport Love Song. Jon Siket
(Cell, Yo La T engo) engineered
the album. Most ‘of the songs
are pretty catchy and include
some of the band’s material
from their earliest shows. Paul
Kaup’s vocals sometimes over-
shadow the band’s efforts, and

-Greenhouse 27 is a trio with
firmly planted roots in
Cleveland. The band has
opened for commercial college
bands like the Judybats, Dada
and the Wallﬂowers. Composed
of former members of the

the same basic formula of most

of the bands they’ve opened for
except the singer sometimes
does that British thing with his

4- Trade Demos
Island

The grainy, green tinted cover
of 4—Tmcle Demos shows Polly
Harvey in a hotel room leaning
against a wall, right hand held
behind her head. She’s dressed

in a black mini-top, black
panties and dark sunglasses,
with a camera hung around her
neck. She stares toward the
photographer blankly. In the
black—and-white back cover
photo, Ms. Harvey stands com-
pletely naked, wrapped in clear
plastic. The lighting of the pic-
ture doesn’t reveal much more
than the outline of her body
and her belly-button. The
expression on her face says
she’d rather be somewhere else.

Neither of the pictures convey
any eroticism. In fact, Harvey’s
facial expressions replace any
hint of the erotic with an air of
absurdity. Instead of looking
hot and bothered, Harvey looks
bored. She presents her sexual

self bluntly and in doing so
drains it of any of its intrinsic
value.

The same can be said about
her music. It abounds in sexual
overtones. (She opened her last
album with the lyric “Tie your-
self to me.”) But instead of

arousing the listener, her music A

unnerves. It gets under your
skin. Rather than adhering to
the standard “verse/chorus”
pop song format, Harvey builds
her songs on tension and
release. Many of her songs
begin quietly with two chords,
reach a crescendo and then
calm down again. While she
might not sound pleasant, she is
awfully absorbing. 4

six previously unreleased songs.

Obviously Island Records,
motivated by the music indus-
try’s current fascination with
“Unplugged” releases and the
hype surrounding Polly Harvey,
decided that now is as good a
time as any to release it. And
since PJ Harvey (the band or the
woman) is not the type of artist
who will eventually record a hit
single and bring the label mega—
bucks, they probably decided to
milk her for all she’s worth
while they can.

4—Tracle Demos probably
won’t earn Harvey any new
fans, but current ‘admirers ought
to enjoy not only the new songs
but the different view it gives
the songs from Rid of Me.
Recorded at home on her four-
track tape recorder before she
landed her deal with Island, the

songs feature Harvey and her.

guitar without the accompani-
ment of a whole band. A few

songs feature a primitive beat-
courtesy of a bass drum,
metronome or merely a piece of
metal.

Despite the simple recording
technique, Harvey gets a full
sound, due in part to the lack of
any fancy studio gimmickry.
Her guitar comes across loud
and clear, alternating between a
wall of heavy chords and noisy
slide work. An acoustic guitar
on “Hardly Wait” provides a
calm, almost pretty interval to
the album.

The big surprise, though,
comes from Harvey’s vocals.
Unlike Rid 0fMe, where her
voice played second fiddle to
the attack of the music, all the
lyrics come ' across clearly.

Her delivery, which generally
alternates between a wail and a
bark, drives home the intensity
of the lyrics: “I’ll make youlick
my injuries/I’m gonna twist
your neck, I say/till you say,
‘Don’t you wish you/never/
never met her/don’t you/ don’t
you wish you never met her”’
(“Rid of Me”); “I was only jok-
ing/let me stroke it” (“Rub It‘
Until It Bleeds”). The aggression
in Harvey’s voice makes these
lyrics sound like more of a
threat than a come—on.

On “Reeling” she distorts the
vocal with the recording, mak-

ing it sound like she’s singing

through a bull horn, and adds a
silly falsetto which rants the title
in the background.

Despite the fact that Harvey
never intended to release these
songs together, they hold up
remarkably well as an album.
The brutal attack basically con-
tinues from track to track, but
the songs themselves stand
apart from each other on the
basis of their musical structure.
Harvey never wears out one
idea. E

As a result, 4—Tracle Demos
comes off as an even stronger
effort than Rid of Me, due to the
fact that it showcases the lyrical
content as much as the musical
delivery.

-Weber’s

on-a-down-daykvoice, he sings
about characters we have come
to associate with Waits him-
self—characters who spend all
night drunk and all day search-
ing for a drink. However, since
his breakthrough 1985 album
Swordfisbtrombones and his
happyimarriage to partner
Kathleen Brennan, Waits has
expanded his style and talent in
an effort to move away from the
admittedly inhibiting shell of
those characters. On
Swordfisbtrombones, Rain
Dogs, and From/e’s Wild Years,
he began experimenting with a
broader range of instrumenta-
tions and musical structures, an
effort which Mr. Waits contin-
ued on his Grammy award win-
ning 1992 album, Bone
Mac/ome. Now, with the release

of The Blczcle Rider, the original .

music composed for Robert
Wilson and William S.
Burroughs’s play of the same
name, Waits, who turned 44
this Tuesday, has moved on to
yet another level—that of “coin-
poser” rather than simply
“songwriter.”

The Blade Rider is a theatrical
collaboration between Waits,
Wilson and Burroughs, respec-
tively the production’s compos-
er, director and writer. The
play, which debuted in 1990 at
the Thallia Theater in Hamburg,
Germany, is Robert Wilson’s
retelling of Carl Maria Von
1821 opera Der
Freisc/outz, based on a German
romantic tale called

Gespensterbuic/9. The Wilson/
Burroughs/ Waits version takes

5-8 PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, December 9, 1993

Von Weber’s light opera, com-
plete with happy ending, and
turns it into a tale of darkness,
evil and addiction. The story
revolves around a batch of
“magic bullets” given to
Wilhelm, the lead, by Pegleg
[the Devil] so that Wilhelm can
win a marksmanship contest
and in turn win the hand of his
true love. Wilhelm, however,
becomes greedy with the bul-
lets and uses them constantly,
thus needing more and more.
“Some way he got into the
magic bullets, and that leads
straight to the devil’s work, just
like marijuana leads to heroin.”
With Burroughs’s libretto,
the Gesperzsterbuc/9 tale
becomes a symbolic look into
the deals we all make with the
Devil each day. This is por-
trayed peifectly by Waits’s devil
blues music. Using instruments
as varied as the musical saw,
accordion and bass clarinet,
Waits creates a creepy, darkly
carnivalesque atmosphere on
songs such as “Gospel Train,”
and William S. Burroughs’s
singing debut, “Ain’t No Sin.”
Other songs, such as the croon-
ing, perfectly Waits—ian “Lucky
Day” are likely to remain in the
repertoire of American stan-
dards for some time to come.
This is the importance of The
Black: Rider: It announces the
arrival of Tom Waits among the
Gershwins of the"worl_d,_ writing
music that will remain wjtli us

; Last Saturday, Frank Zappa,
in the words of his family: "left
for his final tour.." He had been

battling with prostate cancer for p

the past three years. Zappa was
52.

He began his musical career
by being kicked out of his high
school band for smoking in
uniform. Zappa ' started his
band, The‘- ‘Mothers of
Invention, in ihe’ 1960s. He was
most noted 'for* satirical hits
such as "Don't Eat Yellow
Snow" and "Truck Driver
Divorce." But beyond this, he

was also a composer "_ and polit- '
-ical activist. _H_e__,v/as called "one

of the few master composersof
the 20th century" by the
Philadelphia Inquirer.

As a political activist, he
focused his activities on fight-
ing censorship. He once
labeled Tipper Gore a "cultural
terrorist." In his autiobiography,
The Real Frank Zappa Book,
published in 1989, he predicted
that Al Gore would run for
president. He based this predic-
tion on the formation of the
Parents’ Music Resource "Center,
by Tipper Gore. Al Gore gave
up his bid for‘ the presidential
nomination after his son was hit
by a car. J

Zappa attempted to combine
aspects of all genres of music in
his compositions. He attacked
the minimalism which is char-
acteristic of music today. In his
autiobiography he wrote: "One
day these cultural institutions
are going to stop funding mini-
malist music and fund some-
thing else, and the serious
music landscape will be littered
with...the remains of expert
graduate minimalists."

This is a great loss to the
music world. We hope Frank's
final tour plays SRO.

phone, Edwin nonetheless com-
plements the other three ade-
quately, if not fantastically.

Somewhat fittingly, Dig kicks
off with “The Mothers,” a song
in which lead singer Edwin
shouts (get used to it, baby) the
ever-so—pretentious “Listen to
the mothers” before the band
launches into a free-form jam
that warms up the listener for
the rest of the album.

“Rain Will Fall” features a soft
wah—wah underlying a driving
Bruce Gordon bass. Like most

music, lead guitarist Jagori
Tanna mixes the loopy, ‘60’s
psychedelic twangs with some
heavy—syncopated, head-bang-
ing riffs. Mixed nicely, the com-
bination succeeds in a
black/white, salt/pepper sort of
way.

The listener gets his money’s
worth, no doubt, as all but
three songs chime in at over
five minutes (and a pair hit the
seven— and eight—minute mark)
— an obvious clue to the
band’s more jam-oriented

fI1USiC- of the more punchy songs on
Th3t’5 f10t t0 533’ that the the album, Edwin screams (1

from it, actually. In most of the
songs you get what bounces
between a wispy, melodic
structure to a full—on chubfest,
complete with screaming gui-
tar, lunatic drums (sometimes a
little too lunatic) and a steady
bass.

Lead singer Edwin’s lyrics are
delivered with a rock—rap style
that fits the machine—gun music

drum beats (and guitar -licks)
come raining down like a bar-
rage of Mark Price Is.

“So Gently We Go” is maybe
the most playable track on the
album. The album’s fourth track
is strikingly reminiscent of The
Doors’ “The End” — just substi-
tute Ray Manzarek’s cheese-ball

guitar and you’ve about got it..

Good drumming and a safety-
net bass underlying a puddle-
drop guitar effect produce a
sound that only adds to the
spacey feeling of the song.

“So Gently...” is truly the
most laid—back track on the
album, but eventually —
expectedly — erupts into a
more up-tempo jam. The quar-
tet keeps it in check, though,
and ends it nicely.

Edwin hits with lyrics about a
calm, easy—going summer day:
sleeping in, watching the sunset
and going back to bed for
dreams of a “fantastic stage.”

He misses badly, however,
when he gets into most any-
thing deeper than the day’s
events: “I’ll scare you blind with
my confidence/Like Jesus and
his twelve friends.” Ugh.

But no one argued that they
were cutting—edge lyricists, and
by the end you get the feeling
that each has been on the same
page for a long time — much
longer than their three—year
union: '

Continued from page S-4
When these two songs first hit

the hip hop world, people start-
ed expecting big things from
the Wu. Those expectations
were not too big for them to
handle, for they delivered some
of the funkiest sh‘t that has
come out as of recent. These
entrepreneurial brothers from
New York did what most broth-
ers only dream of & talk about.
When contracts have run out or
were rescinded for various rea-
sons, they sirnultaneously start-
ed their own record, manage-
ment, production & publishing
companies. To make a long
story short, they blew them-
selves up. They put out 8: pro-
moted their own product in NY,
&, with some record business
help, this record found its way
to radio stations nationwide (I
would know, I have two of the
first copiesl). It was just a matter
of time before the world found
out what the Wu knew from
day one  they’re all that!!

On this, their debut album,
they take it straight to the
streets. Basic beats & rugged
lyrics—that sums up the album
in a nutshell. With members
Method Man (who also has a
solo contract with Def Jam), 01’
Dirty Bastard (rumor has it
that he_inked a solo contract
with Elektra), The RZA (who
used to go by “Prince Rakeem”
& used to be signed to Tommy
Boy), his cousin The Gizah
(who used to go by “the
Genius” & used to be signed to
Cold Chillin’), Shallah
Raekwon The Chef, Rebel
INS aka Inspektah Dek,
Ghost-Face Killa & Baby U-
God, you’re sure to find a ﬂavor
that you can savor. “Method
Man” is a phat joint that lets
Meth rip it solo. On this song,
he’s on some ol’ next sh*t!
“Shame On A Nigga” gets the
whole crew open on a very
basic loop that has touches of
horn & piano sprinkled on it.
The Ol’ Dirty Bastard does the
most work 8: wreks it the hard-
est. “Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t
Nuthing Ta F**k Wit” is dope
with a very heavy dnimtrack &
bassline that breaks you out
into a bobbing frenzy. That cou-
pled with singing (sampled
from a kung-fu ﬂick, of course)
makes this one a phat classic.
“Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber
(pt.1)” (my personal favorite)
has the brothers gettin’ bizzy
over a dusty, but very raw,
drumtrack spiced up with a
phat piano & a psychotic guitar
lick (it sounds like a B.B. King/
Lucille type of lick). I couldn’t
find the apex of this album
because all of it (except for
“Tearz” ) is all that.

The onlyreal problem that I
found with this album was the
excessive talking. Don’t get me
wrong; the interviews were
dope (conducted by my ace
Martin Moore at WNYU) 8: the
kung-fu snippets are dope, but
the talking (check the beginning
of “...7th Chamber (pt. 1)” ) is
entirely too much 8: not neces-
sary at all;

Don’t sleep, but peep the W21.
For those that do, “sliame on a

nigga” & keep your eyes open
& “protect ya necktl”

Gone are the days of busting
rhymes with the “iggidy, the
bum stiggidy”. Enter the new
style of Drayz And Skoob
EFX. \Vhile I was in New York
they were asked by Martin of
WNYU (this brother got juicel),
“What happened to your old‘
style?” ‘To put it in a nutshell,
they said (my quotes, not theirs
because this is their roundabout
view), “Everyone loved it, took
it & ran off with it. By the time
we got it back, it was played
out. So we had to invent some-
thing new for them to steal.” It’s
true that their style took a 560-
degree turn. They still get bizzy

r h_5.-_1_1
music tip, they also did a 360.
They now use (8: in some cases
play out) jazz. Could this be the
crew from the sewer that would
only use funk? Well...

Straight Up Sewaside. is an
o.k. sophomore effort. Lyrically
the album is totally correct, but
the music is lacking & starts to
sound the same after a while.
There were some bright spots.
“Wontu” is an obese groove
based around a lazy piano & a
Biz Markie sample for the cho-
rus. Dray & Skoob (Books in

 . reverse) bulldoze the hell out of

this track with phat lyrics. “It’z
Lik Dat” provides a lazy, but
phat, bassline that lets you
knock your brains around for a
couple of minutes. “Freakit”
(the first single) is a nice dance
track that remains street. It’s a
phat upright bassline 8; drum-
track that keeps you moving.

Although this album d,oesn’t.

totally stink, it’s not a real
mover either. The production is
not as tight on this album like it
was on the last album. lt’s droll,
boring & Very monotonous. It

just doesn’t stand out.

Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.
Thanks to the Playhouse Film
Repertory we’ll have a chance
to see this fine, small film.
(December 29)

A Dangerous Woman —
Debra Winger gives a poten-
tial Oscar role as a mentally
challenged and vulnerable
woman who meets up with
Gabriel Byrne and gets
pushed around so much that
the film takes on perhaps the
most serious cast of any of the
slated holiday releases. Even
so, the story seems worth a
look with Barbara Hershey
throwing in some supporting
weight. (currently running)

Wayne’s World 2 — Maybe

only because of our last rec-
ommendation, but we all
need a little of what this
dynamic duo’s got—more
cheap chucks. Wayne and
Garth might actually outdo
themselves here, but consid-
ering that they’re trying to
pull an hour and a half from a
five minute t.v. skit high
expectations aren’tla good
idea. (December 10)

Sc/9indler’s List — Yep,
Spielberg’s attempt at art and
history seems intriguing
enough to recommend. With
Liam Neeson as the man who
uses Jews as slave labor dur-

ing the Holocaust and then_

turns into their protector, the
great Steven hopes to have us
sit through three-‘plus hours
of black—and-white story-

telling. If you’ve got the stom-
ach, go. (December 15)

Far Away, 50 Close — Wim
Wenders’s much awaited

story with all the kids from ’

Wings of Desire plus Willem
Dafoe and Lou Reed. This will
definitely be one of those pic-
tures that’ll be here in a post-
holiday way so sit tight and
think about angels for a
while. (December 22)

Six Degrees Of Separation —
Stockard Channing and
Donald Sutherland play the
couple whose uppity world is
violated by the seemingly
innocent Will Smith. This
adaptation of the John Guare
play looks like compelling
cinema. (December 8) — "

Whoawould imagine that this
would be the rating put on this
brother’s debut album?
Remember, this is the same per-

“Deep Cover.” This is the same
person that wrote the platinum

Thang.” This is the same per-
son that co-wrote most of the
triple platinum plus Dr. Dre
debut album The Chronic.
Now it’s his turn to shine & it’s
only a par performance.

Alright, I’m sorry. I’m being
too hard on Snoop. It’s not his
fault that the music is weak. In
my professional opinion, Dre
was stingy as hell with the
tracks. He kept them all for him-
self & gave Snoop the bullsh*t.
Snoop does a remake of “La Di

On the lyrical side, “Tha

Snoop’s lyrics can wear on you.
After a while, you get tired of
hearing aboutniggaz, G’z_,

were phat, you could take it a

Niagra falls to Lady

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Some unique individuals
think going over Niagara Falls is
a fun activity.

The Pitt women’s basketball
team (3-1) found a safer activity
for its trip. to upstate New York,
running all over Niagara
University’s Purple Eagles 73-46
last night at the Gallagher
Center. _

“We did not want to win the
game but score only 66 points,
our average last year,’.’ Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce said. “We
wanted to be in the 70s.”

The Lady Panthers’ defense
continued to be strong as they
held the Eagles to'30.4 percent
shooting on the night. They also
forced 27 turnovers in the con-
test.

“What is most impressive is
we held them to 46 points,”
Bruce said. “They have been
averaging 76 [points per game]
this season.”

That defense was especially
stiﬂing in the first half. Pitt took
a 54-17 lead into the locker
room.

“We had a real good first
half,” Bruce said. “We played
some pretty good defense and
rebounded well.”

Two Lady Panther starters,

Carolyn Miller and Jonna
Huemrich, picked up their
fourth fouls within the first five
minutes of the second half.

“We were up by 20, but you
never know,” Bruce said.
“There was so much time left.”

Huemrich, who routinely
plays at least 55 minutes in
games, was held to only 24 min-
utes. She still had enough time
to score 12 points, grab 11
rebounds and block three shots.
Miller played only 15.

Pitt’s bench came through
again. Rookiencenter Melissa
Thompson racked up 11 points,
six rebounds, three steals and
one block in 25 minutes; Bruce
said sophomore forward Tressa
Bolfert also played well on the
front line.

Rookie Erin Miller chipped in_

eight points in 10 minutes.

“She"s starting to find her
way,” Bruce said. “We played a
lot of people. We’re continuing
to do that. We are going to need
them.” i _

Pitt continued to shoot free
throws erratically, making only
17 of 31 (54.8 percent). Refusing
to outdo the Lady Panthers in
anything, the Eagles hit only 12
of 26 freebies (46.2 percent) on
the ‘night.

tour of Pitt
football

What started out as some
final thoughts on the 1993
Pitt Football season
ended up as a pleasant
vocabulary class.

An attempt was made
to talk to at least one per-
son from each walk of
campus—oriented life and
to comment on what they

_thought of the 1993
Panthers.

Each person utilized a
different word while con-
centrating only on the
positives that came out of ' '
this past season, all the
while putting any nega— .
tives on the back burner.

The journey started out

"at, where else, but Pitt
Stadium.

In talking with running

back coach Charlie Coe,

Stephen
Flinn  

he used the word
-improvement and
described his thoughts on
the season as such:

“Even though we didn’t
meet our productivity
goals, there was a lot of
improvement in compari-
son with the spring.
Anytirne you finish less
than .500, in my opinion,
you can’t necessarily call
the season a success, but I
would call this past sea-
son definitely an
improvement’? he said.

Long-time coaching—_
staff assistant Alex Kramer
centered his opinion
around the word resolu-
tion.

“This year’s football
team resolved to play as
well as they could, no
matter what they were up
against. This was a season
in which the players
almost never gave up,” he
said. .

The next candidate for
giving an opinion was
Walt Bielich, interim head
.of Pitt’s Golden Panthers.
His key word was eﬂort.

“I can’t use the word
success to describe this
year’s team, but I can say

T wo—spoii‘er jones relishes change sof sports seasons

One of Pennsylvania's best high school track stars brings his blazing seed t Pitt

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

When Jamie “Jay” Jones was a
senior at Wdliam Tennent High
School he was faced with a seri-
ous problem of choosing
between either running track or
playing football at the collegiate
level. , J

Jones was named an all-
league selection as a wide
receiver and a defensive back
his senior year, and was select-
ed to play in the Big 33 football
classic.

But on the track he was listed

second in the country in the
300-yard run with a time 31.87
seconds, according to the USA

Todczyis listing of top high-

school track performers.

As a junior Jones won the
Pennsylvania state indoor 55-
meter championship and was a
two-time indoor state champi-
onship in the 60-yard dash.

While Jones became a sur-
prise to PIAA sports fans, his
mothersaid she believes her
son had talent a long time ago.

“'\Vhen Jay was very young he
used to race with his brother
and all the other older boys,”

Kermitta Jones said. “They used
to chase him around. All of a
sudden he was _outrunning

everybody else.” ‘
After turning down football
scholarships from South

Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia
Tech, Clemson, Boston‘ College
and Syracuse, the ﬁve—foot-nine-
inch sophomore chose the
University of Pittsburgh.

“I came to Pitt because of a
promise from [former head
coach Paul] Hackett,” Jones
said.

“He promised me I could play
both sports.”

As a first—year athlete on the
football field Jones had to learn
the system by route of the spe-
cial teams. ‘

An uncelebrated special
teams’- player for the first half of
the season, Jones burst from
anonymity when he ran down
former Syracuse great Quardy
Ismail for a touchdown saving
tackle. "

With that play Jones made a

Santa's gift

Regardless of the fact that
Christmas is, for us, still a few
exams and a paper or two
away, it is around the corner.
Consequently, a very select
group of celebs in the sporting
world have received their annu-
al presents a little early.

Those who have prematurely
unwrapped:

-Matt Frier

Florida St.’s gritty, Tom
Waddle-esque receiver received
a gift from the Sports Writers of
America that, single-handedly,
saved the ‘Nole’s National
Championship hopes.

After their heartbreaking loss
to Notre Dame, Frier pleaded
with the mass media not to drop
them in the polls and to give
them another shot — a
deserved shot — at the national
title.

He got it, andthe garnet and
gold are fixing to get it (their
first title), too. They received a
decade’s worth of presents
when the overrated Nebraska
Cornhuskers beat Oklahoma to
pave their way to the Orange

Bowl. Here‘ it is: ‘Noles 42,

‘Huskers 14.

-LouHoltz

The Irish’s coach survived
another yearwithout being
punched in the head.

0 Len nox Lewis

OK,‘ -Evander Holyfield
knocked out Riddick Bowe and
is the new (can we say
“retread”) heavyweight champi-

‘on of the world.

Lewis will beat Holyfield
when they, God willing, eventu-
ally fight. That’sta pretty even
fight, I guess, between a pair of

fighters who don’t have rivers of L g
bad blood flowing between t
them like Bowe and Lewi’s,_d,o._. ,  _

But stick Bowe in the ring

against Lewis,  the Brit is. a 
part of the canvas.‘ I don’t really "

care if Boweiis twice the
(over)weight he reported to be
during the title fight with
Holyfield; he’d maul Lewis.

’ And mark my words; it’ll hap- N

pen, and Lewis will pay.

-Dean Smith

The North Carolina head
coach received a huge gift
when senior Pat Sullivan opted
to sit out a year because of the
huge talent crunch in Chapel
Hill.

Although there has been talk A

of Jeff Mclnnis transferring out
outta Carolina, Sullivan’s season
of rest goes a long way to
ensure that the Rasheed
Wallaces and Jerry Stackhouses
of the Baby Blue will be there in
the future.

P.S. There is no truth to the
rumor that Sullivan will leave
school to tour with Spinal Tap
as a back-up drummer. You
know, just in case.

-Shaquille O’Neal

The Orlando Magic center is
both rich and talented and an
up-and-coming megastar, but
just let me say that he is damn
lucky that he has Rod Thorne
and the NBA to watch his
mouth for him.

Remember those incendiary
remarks that me made about
receiving unfair treatment from
NBA refs? I heard that students

would use Carl Pickens’ “Jungle”

Berkeley ‘cause of them.

Come on, Shaq and his fellow
superstars are, above all else
(and I don’t want this to sound
anally PC, thank you Kurdt
Cobain), Americans. If they feel
they are being treated unfairly,
they have a right to say so.

I don’t buy the “This—is-our-
future—so-let’s-make-sure—he-
doesn’t—screw—us” theory that
some espouse in regards to
O’Neal. It’s real easy to let some
stiff cut Shaq down in the name
of good defense, then ﬂag him
for a ticky—tack foul at the other
end with a “he shoulda known
better” philosophy.‘

Guzman suffered a knee
injury which will keep her
out of the lineup indeﬁnitely.

With Guzman out, Erin
Maloy is playing at the point
guard spot. She scored 10
points last night.

“Erin played a strong 18
minutes for us,” Bruce said.
“She’s getting back [from a
preseason knee injury]. She
can handle it [point guard].
There is no question about
it.” -

Maloy has played primarily
at the point most of her
career.

-Pitt bounced back from
the loss to Vandy with an 88-
75 win over Loyola (Md.)
Sunday. Jenine Joyce tossed
in a career-high 18 points‘.

as well as eight rebounds
and five steals. Senior
guard/forward Jill Colabrese
(14 points), Carolyn Miller
(11) and junior point guard
Carol Morton (10) were also
in double ﬁgures.

Loyola kept score
respectable with an edge at
the charity stripe, hitting 34
of 36 (94.4 percent). Loyola’s
Patty Stoffey scored a game-
high 32 points, in large part
due to a 16-17 performance
from the line.

has developed over time,”
Catlett said. “These young men
have grown as people, they’ve
grown as players and they’ve
grown as a team. I hope their
time is this year.” A

If the time does come for the
‘Eers’ five seniors, the man in
charge of keeping time offen-
sively will again have to lead
the way. That man? Basey.-

A five—foot-eight-inch scat-
back point man, Basey turned
up the heat on opposing
defense all season in ‘92—93,
averaging 13.2 points per game
along with 5.5 assists and 4.4
rebounds. His relentless effort
earned him all-A10 honors.

“For us to reach our potential,
we need Basey to have the
senior year he is capable of, in
terms of regulating the game at
all times,” Catlett said “I have no
doubt that he will do that. In

1 terms of leadership, defensive

play, scoring in the clutch and
‘great hustle, he is one of a
kind.”

Basey (17.5 points per game
in ‘93) nearly stole victory from
sure—fire defeat last year at Pitt,
scoring 30 points and leading
WVU to within one last-gasp
shot of defeating the Panthers.

West._.~Virginia leads the all-
time series with Pitt, 82-68, with
the Panthers winning the first-
ever battle back in 1906, 30-25.

-PITT NOTES: One for the
“\X/'hewl’-’ department. Jerry
McCullough, who left Tuesday
night’s win at St. John’s with
two minutes left in regulation —
a victim of the ole ﬁve—foul rule
— didn’t actually foul out.

After being assessed a techni-
cal foul for hanging on the rim
after a dunk, Big East officials
told Evans and the Pitt bench
that McCullough had fouled out.
But after further discussion -
after the ballgame —— it was
determined that McCullough
could have been ejected had he
been assessed an unsportsman—
like conduct foul. McCullough’s
foul was a technical foul, not a
personal or ﬂagrant foul.

football,” Bielich said.

In moving the search
into the classroom, sever-
al students were asked
their thoughts on the past
football season.

Defensive lineman Tom
Barndt concentrated his
opinion on positiveness.

“I definitely feel much
more positive following
this season than last sea-
son,” Barndt said. “Maybe
we weren’t as productive
as we would have liked to
have been, but as the sea-

-son went on, we became
more and more adjusted
to the coaching staff."

CGS teacher Mike Kelly
stressed optimism in talk-
ing abut this year’s
Panther football team.

“Was this past" season a
success? Certainly! I am
an optimist. Hey, we won
three games didn’t we?”

Hillman Library staff I
member Paul Kohberger '
saw relaxation in a good
sense as being a key to
this year’s team.

“There was a lot less
tension toward the coach
this year. That team
played hard for their
coaches. They won two
games they weren’t sup-
posed to win," Kohberger
said.

There was a lot less ten-
sion toward the team to
perform as a result."

Full-time student Eric
Kizak said he thought the
Panther performance was —
exciting, although the
win-loss record would
never reﬂect that.

“Some of those games
were exciting this year.
That’s more than could be
said about Panther foot-
ball teams in the previous
years.” 

Full—time student Ian
Halpern agreed with that
explanation, but his '
description concentrated
on the word want.

"The team seemed as if
it really wanted to play.
They weren’t just going
through the motions,”
Halpern said.

So the final word is now
in on evaluating this
year’s Pitt football season.
It's really a conglomera-
tion of words — the
Panthers were relaxed
and positive in their -
resolved effort to remain
optimistic by always
improving and thus want-
ing to showstability.

den his dream of winning his
first conference championship
was snapped. He strained his
hamstring while competing in
the ﬁnals of the 55 meters at the
Big East championship.

“The guy that won the meet, I
beat in the semi’s,” Jones said. “I
felt disappointed because I
wanted to what I could do
against everyone else. I was
confident that I was going to
place high in the meet.

“Secondly, I was disappointed
because I couldn’t run a leg on
the mile relay.”

After having a whole year to
think about what could have
happened, Jones is psyched up
about his chances of winning
the title this year.

“The guy [Carlos Jones of
Miami] who won the Big East
last’ year, I not only beat in the
semi’s, but he is also a two-
sport athlete,” Jones said.

So far this season it looks as if
he might accomplish that feat.

under his belt, Jones ran the
second fastest time in Pitt histo-
ry in the 55 meters with a
scorching time of 6.51‘ seconds.

“I think he has the potential to
be a premier sprinter,” Pitt
men’s sprint/hurdles coach
Steve Lewis said.

“I think he is in the making to
be a quality sprinter. Our goal
for him this year indoors is to
make it to NCAA champi-
onship.”

Lewis isn’t the only person to
notice Jones is really deter-
mined to make the most out of
track.

“He really cares about track,”
junior hurdler Wes Alexander
said. 

“If he keeps running the way
he is running, he should make
the National Championship. He
should win every meet on the
East Coast. I don’t think that
there is anyone who can run
with him in the Big East and the
IC4A’s. If he keeps himself right
I can’t see any one stopping
him.”
