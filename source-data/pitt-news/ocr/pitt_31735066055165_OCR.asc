Marcus Rediker, a Pitt history

“They saw him as the Antichrist
because he spoke out against the

Rediker said the Philadelphia
Police Department has been desper-

information about Abu-Jamal since
he was a 15-year-old member of the
Black Panthers.

“The unjust ruling by the
Pennsylvania State Supreme Court
is only the last action in a long and
vicious vendetta,” he said.

Study: Eating disorder
linkedto biology

Kelly Ruane
Staff Wrlter

A new study has found a biological
link to bulimia and suggests that the dis-
order could possibly be genetic.

Researchers headed by Dr. Walter
Kaye, professor of psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
Western Psychiatric Institute, have dis-
covered evidence that an alteration in
brain chemistry could possibly be the
underlying cause of the development of
bulimia nervosa.

“The amount of evidence that eating
disorders have a biological basis has

been growing
steadily,” Kaye
said.

Bulimia ner-—
vosa is a serious
eating disorder
most commonly
characterized by
binge eating —
ingesting large
amounts of food in
a short time — fol—. .
lowed by purging — either by self-
induced vomiting or laxative abuse — to
counter the effects of the eating.

Bulimia affects 1- to 3—percent of
women, often people who are of normal
body weight. Bulimia usually begins
during adolescence.-

It is known that women with bulim-
ia, when binging and purging, have alter-
ations in brain serotonin activity, a
chemical neurotransmitter in the brain
that helps regulate mood and contributes
to an obsession with perfectionism.

The study found that even after the
recovery from bulimia, the alterations
and symptoms continued, which sug-

abnormal eating patterns.

“Our study may have identiﬁed a
biological risk factor that plays a part in
deciding who develops ‘a disorder,”
Kay'e said. “This study is important
because it will help shift focus to the
underlying causes of bulimia so we can
develop better treatments in the future

the disorder before it occurs.”
Bulimia causes medical problems in

’ nonexistent menstrual periods, depres-

gests that it is not just a consequence of _

and possibly identify people at risk of

sion, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive
disorder, ‘and it often results in drug and
alcohol abuse. Bulimia also frequently
causes malnutrition.

Because _malnutrition associated
with eating disorders affects brain chem-
istry, Kaye and his team performed a
study that compared 31 healthy women
to 30 women who had recovered from
bulimia. *9

The women were of normal body
weight, had. regular menstrual cycles,
and had not binged or purged for more
than a year. Researchers looked for con-
tinuing behavioral disturbances and also

measured the _levels of major brain

chemicals such as
s ‘e r o t o n i n ,
dopamine and nor-
epinephrine, in the
recovered, partici-
pants.

In addition, the
recovered women
were given a non-
therapeutic drug
that specifically
affects the sero-
tonin system and elicits hormonal and
behavioral responses.

The results showed that, compared
to the healthy women, recovered bulim-
ics still had increased levels of the sero-
tonin, more negative moods, and obses-
sions with perfectionism. These women
also had more anxiety and disorganized
behavioral responses to the administered
drug. . .
“While further research in this area
is needed, we are beginning to gain an
understanding of some of the causes of
bulimia nervosa,” said Kaye.

Kaye is also the principal investiga- A

tor for a malnutrition study that may help
pinpoint the genetic basis. for bulimia
nervosa. Research sites in cities such as
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York and
Los Angeles are trying to recruit 400
men and women with the disorder who
also have a biological relative with sim-
ilar eating problems.

_ The paired relatives will give blood
samples for genetic analysis and will be
inteﬁviewed about their disorder.
Comparing the genes from this large
group of relatives may identify the gene
or genes underlying the disorder, Kaye

-said.

Sarcoidosis, the rare lung disease with
which the doctors diagnosed him, had
a 96-percent survival rate.

Jenkins, now an associate art pro-
fessor at Pitt, continued working long,
underpaid hours as a graphic designer
in Dallas in the late 1980s without any
fears for her stepfather’s condition.
Then, suddenly, his lung. collapsed, and
he died at the age of 46.‘ ‘

- Though grief-stricken and con-
fused, Jenkins realized her stepfather
died with many unfulfilled dreams, and
she decided she didn’t want that to
happen to her. So at a major turning
point in her life, Jenkins decided to
return to school and pursue her love of
art. '

“I realized I had a dream. It had
always been there,” said Jenkins. “If he
hadn’t died, I might never have gone
back to school.”

Now, 10 years after her stepfa-

'ther’s death, Jenkins, 34, is not only an

associate professor in the Frick School
of Fine Arts at Pitt, but also an accom-

feelings as she grew up. It’s a testimo-
ny of her life as well as a general look
at women. Her work defines the enig-
ma of the female body.

Jenkins said she’s wanted to show
her work at the Mattress Factory since
she first toured it.

“I was blown away,” she said. “I
thought, ‘Oh my God. I want to show
here some day.”’

So when the museum approached
her to do a piece, she was ecstatic.

“I couldn’t do this-_ piece some-
where else,” she said. “That’s what
makes the Mattress Factory different.
They’re there with the artist in mind.
It’s wonderful for the artist; there-are
no preconceived plans.” .

After worrying about ideas and
putting unnecessary pressure on her-
self, an idea finally arose.’

“I was fed up and started contem-
plating my nave1,” said Jenkins. “What
about the idea of my bellybutton? The
point of connection with the mother

As election fever swept America, so did
a rash of strange elections, perhaps left over
from the creepiness of the Halloween holi-
day.

Trick or treat — Following the spirit of
giving, Fred Tuttle, the Vermont GOP can-
didate for U.S. Senate, recently armounced
he would treat his opponent, three-terrn
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy by voting
for him. Leahy tricked the 79-year-old
retired dairy farmer by winning with about
73 percent of the vote. V

That’s not a mask — Just as professional
wresﬂers, vampires and baseball players
showed up at neighborhood doorstops
Saturday, their names turned up in ballot
boxes Tuesday — only this time, they were
real.

Perhaps the best-known election oddity
this year has been the election of Jesse “The
Body” Ventura to the gubernatorial office of
Minnesota. " A

MUMIA

Rediker added that Abu-Jamal
was known as “the voice of the
voiceless” because he tried to cover
stories people usually didn’t cover
and he refused to be terrorized by
the “rampant police brutality in
Philadelphia.”

According to Rediker, Gov.
Ridge announced his pencil was
sharpened and ready to sign a death
warrant. '

Rediker said‘ that in August
1995, Abu-Jamal came within 10
days of being executed.

“If not for groups like [the
Western Pennsylvania Committee to
Free Mumia Abu-Jamal], Mumia
would be dead,” Rediker said.

Dorothy Urquhart, a member of
the United Concerned Christians at
Work, said America is sick and
needs healing.

“We need to stop being a coun-
try like a country of Hitler,”
Urquhart said. “Mumia has proven
himself not guilty over and over
again.”‘

Rediker said the prosecution
maintains that Faulkner was shot
with Abu—Jamal’s .38—caliber gun,
which he carried as protection while
moonlighting as a cab driver.
However, he said, the medical
report stated the bullet that killed
the officer was fired from a .44-cal-
iber gun.

“[The Philadelphia police]
always tried to paint Mumia as a
wild creature,” said Abu—Jamal’s
sister Lydia Wallace in statement.

Wallace said the police didn’t
check Abu—Jamal’s hands for any
lead residue, a common police pro-
cedure.

Rediker called Judge’ Albert
Sabo, who convicted Abu-Jamal, the
“hanging judge” because he has put
more minorities on death row and
has had more rulings overturned
than any other judge in America.

“He’s a venomous character,”
Rediker said; “When that man walks
into the courtroom, the Constitution
dies a little.”

No matter the outcome, Abu-
Jamal’s case is going to be remem-
bered as the most infamous case in
American history, Rediker said.

JENKINS

and disconnection after the umbilical
cord is broken.” '

Her husband, Andy English, a pho-
tographer, took photographs of her
bellybutton. The black-and—white pho-
tos captured a tiny ‘scar around her
navel from an operation to remove an
ovarian cyst when Jenkins was 16. For
Jenkins, her bellybutton itself became
the scar, she said.

L Then Jenkins sewed buttonholes
into Polaroid photographs, and connec-
tions between bellybuttons and button-
holes slowly appeared to her.

“I saw the bellybutton without the
umbilical cord and buttonhole without
the buttons as useless things,” she said.
“Just their presence is a reminder of the
absence of the other thing, and that
reminder reminds them of their lack
and sense of loss.”

The finished exhibit is an installa-
tion piece that fills three rooms on the
third ﬂoor of the museum. The first
room is dark with three translucent cur-
tains hanging from the ceiling.
Buttonholes are sewn at waist length
on each curtain. If you kneel down, the
holes line up and you can see the back
wall of the third room. Thecurtains

sway as you walk around them into the

next room.

The half—dome roof makes the
room feel curved and circular. The
walls are lined with smooth rope that
draws people to touch it.

“The cotton material comes out of .

the walls so you see the ends,” said
Jenkins. “It’s incredibly soft and warm
. because the whole room is made up of
these materials and sound is absorbed.”

The third room is empty and there ,

seems to be a lonely, isolated feeling as
in the first room, but it’s brighter. On
the wall across from the entrance, at

- waist level, is a bellybutton carved into

the wall.
“I felt like I was ﬂoating under
- water—,”- said Sonia Yoon, assistant to
’ the curator at the Mattress Factory.

Though Jenkins’ piece is’ finished, ‘

she "said she still feels like she is
searching for herself. She said she’s

. tired of moving from job to job and

. would like to raise a family with her
husband.

' “I’m in the same boat as she is,”
"said English, a photography instructor
at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. “Our
work is related in that_way. If there’s
one thing we have in common, it’s that
searching.” '

Jenkins’ advice to her college stu-
dents who are pursuing art is to be
patient and persevere. For Jenkins,

9 such devotion came after many years
of ignoring her dreams and sacrificing
her talent.

Now Jenkins is busy helping other
students realize their talents. At Pitt,
she helped institute a business art class
for the preparation and practice in visu-

she Said

al arts.

" “I’ve never taken sculpture before,
and it’s different [from] other studio
classes,” said Elke Knethtl, a sopho-
more in Jenkins’ sculpture class.
“She’s really good. She sits down with
us and talks to the students. Plus she’s
doing her own work, so she can relate
to us in a way.”

“She’s a very good instructor, and
she has the work to back it up,” agreed
junior Vivian Workman. “She can
teach by examples and not theory. She
has her own art shows, and you can see
where she’s coming from. She is not
just teaching out of a book.”

Ventura’s shock victory Cl boost
to American democracy

Jesse “The Body” Ventura’s carn-
paign advertisements feature kids
playing with an action ﬁgure of him-
self beating up “Special Interest
Man.” Ventura is known more for his
wrestling antics and his movies (his
role in Predator left an indelible mark
on ‘80s culture) than his political
qualiﬁcations as former mayor of
suburban Brooklyn Park, 

But jaws dropped when Ventura
unexpectedly won the govemorship
of Minnesota, trouncing his
Democratic and Republican oppo-
nents in possibly one of the biggest
upsets in America’s political history.
Whatever jokes may come about this
ex-wrestler govemor-elect, his victory
proves that American democracy is
still working. .

“I’ll tell you what, I’ll bet tl1ey’re
never going to take the people lightly
again, are they?” said the 10-year
political veteran Ventura at a press
conference Tuesday night

Political pundits had done just
that prior to the elections; most had
predicted that Ventura, a Reform
Party candidate, would come in a
close third behind Democrat Hubert
Humphrey IH and the Republican
mayor of St. Paul, Minn., Norm
Coleman. They garnered 28 percent
and 34 percent of the vote, respective-

. 1y, compared to Ventura’s 37 percent

Favored by liberals and moder-
ates alike, Ventura shouldn’t have too
much of a problem dealing with the
Democrat—dominated state’ legisla-
ture. If he was able to defeat the
money hose of the Republicans and
the Democrats, it shou1dn’tbetoo dif-
ﬁcult for him to pass his ideas through
(even though he did not promisetoo
much in his campaign, with the
exception of saying that he’d retum
money to the people if their was a
state budget surplus).

Of course, from here on
Ventura’s political career is going to
be tough. On a national scale,
Ventura’s term as govemor will prove
if the third-party system is a viable
option for America’s future. Analysts
will be looking at Minnesota to see
what Ventura will be doing and what
he will or won’t accomplish.
Ventura’s govemorship of Minnesota
is America’s ﬁrst true litmus test of
Ross Perot’s Reform Party. The peo-
ple will see ﬁrsthand if the Reform
Party can handle being in political
office.

Ventura’s victory is much more
than a ﬂuke — much more than a
celebrity on a third-party ticket With
no goals or aims. His victory will
decide whether a third party has a

chance of breaking into the political-

mainstream in the near future.

Don’tminc| the trip, do mind the people

What is it about long bus trips that makes
me hate so readily?

Oh, I know: people. . _ _

Don’t get:-me wrong; I like people. It’s just
that I don’t like to be so close to them for long
periods of time. They just get on my nerves with
all their talking and moving about and breathing.

Also, the seats are uncomfortable.

It is the case on any bus trip that people I
may normally ﬁnd only mildly annoying
become quite the armoyance. I picture them with
oversized leeches attached to their faces, sucking
the life from their dull bodies. (I ﬁgure it’s a good
analogy for how I feel.) I may be overreacting.

However, I am forced to hear the intimate
details of the other passengers’ personal lives —
people with whom I’d rather avoid eye contact
but whose contraceptive measures I am forced to
imagine. “Oh, I plumped up when I went on the
pill,” one woman says. “Yeah, I’ve been on the
pill for a while now. You knew I was on the pill,

right.” I don’t care how rapturous and big-girl-I

like she feels about taking the oral contraceptive
pill —'I don’t want to know about it

At this point, my legs are
crushed by the seat in front of me."
“Hey, is that OK?” the seat’s user
asks. “Or is this OK?” he asks as my
tibiae snap. -

I smile and nod politely, ﬁghting back the
tears, not wanting him to go any farther. I stretch
my shattered legs under his seat as my own is
jostled about. Obviously, the passenger behind
me feels he needs more room. He is, however,
wrong; I adjusted my seat before he even board-
ed the bus, allotting what I felt was the appropri-
ate space. By the unspoken laws of society, I had
jurisdiction in that zone.

After a retum from a rest stop, I ﬁnd my
seat-back has been pushed forward, thereby
reducing my total space. “Truly a crafty one,” I
think. “A soon as he falls asleep, his tibiae are
mine.” The small-scale Wars make the already
uncomfortable chairs, almost unbearable. I ﬁnd
myself in all sorts of odd positions. I drape
myself over the arrnrests and bend my knees to
my chest in an attempt to be comfortable and
perhaps fall asleep.

The point is, however, I deal with it I can’t
stand the people who avoid the situation by
throwing themselves to the ﬂoor and stretching
out. Oh, they’re so smug,‘ these happy, straight-

CHRIS

GRISWOLD

COLUMNIST

 

backboned people whose heads I ﬁnd by my
feet.

“Oops, sorry,” I say. “I didn’t see you down
there,” as I keep an evil grin from showing.

I don’t think the human ﬂoor mats would
bother me if they were to ‘do it late at night when
everyone’s bodies are settled, their bladders
empty. Too many times I have heard another
passenger say, “Oh, I just can’t get comfortable.
I think I’ll scrub the ﬁlthy ﬂoor with my
sweater.” Immediately after, the driver says,
“OK, we’re ready to go.”

But they lie there, in the middle of every-
one’s path, forcing acrobatics from people who
should not attempt them. Everyone near the
prone body becomes a handheld for each adven-
turous soul climbing over the seats toward the
bathroom. I’m always amused when these ﬂoor-
dwellers get an accidental swiﬁ kick to the groin
area.

I can’t say I like the bathroom usage, either,
though. I mean, these are long trips, and anything
left in the bathroom stays in the bathroom — for
the duration of the trip. Therefore,
every time the bathroom door opens,
we are presented with a fermentation
rivaling the stench of Oakland

But the frequent urinates do
not bother me as much as the passen-
gers climbing over bodies in the other direction,
intent on forcing the crowd to “enjoy” their
favorite movies. These ﬁne movies range front
“Grease” to “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” to
“Grease.”

I have nothing against the “hand jive,” but
I’d rather not sit through it again, especially with

half a busload of girls singing poorly and waving .

ﬂreir arms about madly in an effort to gain accep-
tance ﬁorn their peers (These are the same girls
who collect “scnmchies”). .

As for “I-Iunchback,”~I don’t ﬁnd Disney-I

movies too amusing. The movie is a piece of

crap. Ireally don’t like Disney taking such artis-‘

tic license with great works of litera'tur‘e, putting

mouse ears on Beowulf and all that —- but that’s :

another column
As I watch these movies, I am constantly

. reminded of the cognitive levels of those around ‘

me. And then the leeches come out.

Chris Griswold is really a big liar; his tibiae are

ﬁne. They were his femurs.

The Pill‘ News survey: Are you Cl stalker?

Gerald Bergen and
James Maude

A note from the writers: This col-
umn is meant to be taken in jest. We
are by no means advocating stalkers,
the act of stalking, or the loneliness,
insanity, and crushing manic boredom
that is a stalker’s life. We solidly
aﬂirm the right of people not to be
stalked; however, this right does not
extend to movie and TV stars, politi-

- cal figures, sport personalities, musi-

cians and other celebrities. We feel
that the line must be drawn some-
where. By the way, that was another
joke. Sorry.

This survey is intended for those
who have “strange” feelings toward
members of the opposite sex, those
who have had rabid ex-boyfriends or
ex-girlfriends, or those who plan to
become rabid themselves.

that will ascertain whether you are a

Why you should
root for other
Big East teams

Can you imagine a die—hard
Steeler fan rooting for the Browns?

' How about a Yankees fan cheering for

the Red Sox?

In most sports, all the other teams
in your team’s division are the ene-
mies. You pull for them to lose. Not
just lose, but lose badly and lose often.

College football is the exception.

Many college—football fans root
for the other teams in their school’s
conference. The reason for this is sim-
ple: The better the conference is, the
better it is for all the teams in that con-
ference.

The exceptions to this exception
are when one of the other schools is a

. big rival or when your team is battling

another team for_/ a conference title,
final bowl slot, etc.

And with the Big East in the state
it is, Pitt fans should be cheering damn
hard for the other Big East schools.

While the_ Big East isn’t quite the
MAAC or Conference USA, it is a far
cry from the Big Ten or the SEC.

If Pitt wants to turnits program
around, it needs the Big East to be a
top—notch conference.

Last year, the Big East sent four
teams —— Syracuse, West Virginia,
Virginia Tech and Pitt — to postseason
bowl games. They went a combined 0-
4 and were out—scored, 153-58.

In order for Pitt to turn its program
around, it needs the Big East to be a
top—notch conference, If the confer-
ence is strong, it’ll get better, bowl bids
and better TV coverage. That trans-
lates as more money for all the Big
East schools.

The Big East does have the mak- '

ings to become an elite conference; all
the schools except for Rutgers and
Temple have storied football tradi-
tions. It’s just that as luck would have
it, many of the schools are down right
now.

Last year was the low point for the
Big East, but the good thing is that this
year, it appears the conference as a
whole is much stronger and may be on
its way back.

Syracuse is a very ‘dominant team.
Quarterback Donovan McNabb is one
of the nation’s most explosive players
and is a legitimate candidate for the
Heisman Trophy.

A battle for last place does not always
grasp the attention of football fans, espe-
cially this late in the sea-
son. However, when the
Panthers square off
against Temple on T
Saturday, there is still
much to be won.

Pitt has lost its last
three games and will
need to win its remain-
ing four to qualify for a
bowl game. The task is
improbable, but a win
does not have any nega- _ 
tive implications. The
Temple Owls are strug-
gling at 1-7 and are
eliminated from bowl
contention, but _ their
only victory was at

otherwise very disappointing season. Pitt
is coming off a 45-28 loss to Big ‘East-
leading Syracuse last week. Junior quar-
terback Matt O’Connor got his ﬁrst colle-
giate start, but was replaced in the second
quarter by Matt Lytle, who had started the
previous six games. Lytle will get the nod
this week for the Panthers. He has thrown
13 touchdown passes and nine intercep-
tions this season. Lytle is currently ﬁfth in
the Big East in total yardage. Opposing
him will be freshman Devin Scott, who
runs the option offense for the Owls.

Temple relies heavily on the ground
attack, attempting more than three times
as many rtmning plays as passing plays
through its ﬁrst eight games. Scott has
completed only 12 of 33 attempted passes
for 289 yards and two touchdowns.

Pitt’s running game has struggled and

is last in the Big East, averaging only 2.9
yards per rush. Despite a commitment to
the rim, coach Walt Ham's’ offense has
been mostly one—dimensional. Kevan

As a freshman, Demond Gibson start-
ed 10 of 11 games'for the Panthers. Last
season, as a sophomore, he started none.

Gibson’s role was undeﬁned heading
into the ‘98 football season, but he has
once again emerged on the defensive line
to start every game at nose tackle.

“It’s always fun to be the starter. I
spent more time getting in better shape,
conditioning, and learning the system,”
‘Gibson said.

Part of the learning process was
spending last season watching All-Big
East performers Frank Moore and Jeff
McCurley. Overall, Gibson believes that
last season’s reserve role has made him
“more mature and a better player and a
better man.” I

The statistics so far this season back
up his claim of being a better player. With
four more games to go this season, Gibson
has 30 total tackles, which is six fewer
than his total in ‘96 and two fewer than in
‘97. Five of those tackles this season were
for a loss, which is three more than his
total for the two previous seasons com-
bined.

Through his individual success,
Gibson has helped lead the Panthers to the
17tl1 best defense in the nation. Their high-
est ranking this season was ninth, but that

Gibson is not new to success or high
rankings. He was highly recruited out of
high school and was rated the second—best
defensive line prospect in the Eastern
region. BlueChip Illustrated named him to

list as an oﬁensive line-
man. He also was selected

Picks forihe big conference gamesihai will do

The fun begins now.

From I this point on, teams make or
break theirjseasons while playing against
their conference foes.

There are those who want to continue

' their winning ways in hopes of conference

titles and elite bowl games. Others are ﬁght-
ing for their bowl lives and need to win as
many games as possible to keep up their
hopes of postseason appearances.

‘ Then there are those teams that would
love to play spoilers, ‘knowing that wins
could ruin their opponents’ seasons and, in
some cases, give them something to build
upon for the rest of the season.

little bit of each scenario, and to help me

Oh, how quickly the mighty have fall-

but they didn’t. Now they are the under-
dogs, which they were when they upset
Virginia Tech. Meanwhile, Pitt was favored
to defeat Rutgers but didn’t, and yet it is
expected to win by two touchdowns against
Temple. Confused yet? I sure am. But I also
know that Pitt is a much better team than its

record shows, while the only thing surpris-
ing about Temple’s 1-7 mark is that the one
win came ‘against Virginia Tech. The
revamped Matt Lytle will begin to turn the
season around for the Panthers, while the

Syracuse (-2 1/2) at West.

for Syracuse by nmning for

not gotten an exceptional performance from
superstar Amos Zereoue for most of the
season. Marc Bulger has had a decent sea-
son at quarterback for WVU in his junior
season and will be counted upon heavily to
keep his team in the game. Neither defense
is spectacular, but Syracuse.’s offense will
put up enough points to allow for padding
as it remains dominant in this series.

undefeated UCLA team to the wire, and
injuries played a part in last week’s loss. If
anyone has been a disappointment, it’s been
the Washington Huskies, who started the
season in the top ﬁve, and have since fallen
off the face of the earth. Brock Huard has
not provided the oﬁensive spark that was
expected of him, and it won’t be there for

- this game, either. The Ducks  walk over

the Huskies.

The red and white Owls fly into Pittsburgh

Melissa Baran

 give it a fiercer, more

Staff Writer

To Temple University students,
the owl is more than just a bird of wis-
dom — it’s their school mascot.

Temple was the first school to
adopt the owl as its mascot, and it has
used the bird since the university’s
founding in the 1880s.

The owl was established as the
school’s symbol because it was a noc-
turnal hunter, and Temple began as a
night school for students of limited
means.

“The founder of Temple, Russell
Conwell, said the owl of the night
makes the eagle of the day,” said
Brian Kirschner, Temple’s director of
media relations for sports.

The owl has gone on to represent
more than just the spirit of the night
school Temple used to be. It is accept-
ed as a symbol of wisdom and
knowledge.

“The only other
school in Division
I—A that shares our
mascot are the
Rice Owls of
H o u s t o n ,

  
  
  
  

Kirschner said. -

The “T” is said to be made up of
four separate and simple forms, three
of which have classic, angular shapes.

» There are two identical pillar—like side

pieces set on a ﬂat base arranged to
produce a simple “T” within
‘a larger, more complicat-

ed one.
The logo con-
sists of a white
“T” on a cherry
background. The

Kirschner the colors which
reported the have been the
owl logo has university’s offi=
changed over the  cial colors for
last two years to  ' almost its entire exis-

modem feel.

Aside ‘from the owl, another sym-
bol synonymous with Temple is the
Temple “T.” The “T” was originally
implemented by school President
Peter J. Liacouras, who chose a design
created by students at Temple’s Tyler
School of Art.

“The ‘T’ is a little more modern
than the owl and is the primary logo

that is used at the university,”

 
 

tence.

Though the combina-
tion of red with white is quite com-
mon, cherry with white is quite
unique. Only one other school now
uses cherry and white: Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy-, N.Y. The
color was derived from the ripe
American black cheny.

Temple’s red and white owls will ’

swoop down on Pittsburgh to face the
Panthers Saturday afternoon at 3:30.

Barlow leads the Panthers with 345 yards
rushing. Temple has seven players who
have at least 100 yards ‘rushing this sea-
son, led by senior Stacy Mack, who is ﬁfth
in the conference with 608 yards on just
97 carries.

Latef Grim continues to be a domi-
nating force at wide receiver for the
Panthers, leading the Big East in receiving
yards. He is second in the conference in
catches, and he is tied for second in touch-
downs with 10. He and senior split end
Terry Murphy may be the keys to
Saturday’s game. Temple’s secondary is
very small, and the defense only has two
interceptions, whereas Pitt’s Hank Poteat

T continues to lead the nation with 5 picks in

7 games.

Pitt’s defense has been suspect against
the option, and Temple may need to
exploit this weakness if it is to gain the
upper hand in Saturday’s game. But Pitt’s
defense is not ranked 17th nationally for
its lack of big plays.

Thiswillbethe29thtimethetvvo
teams have met and the 25th straight sea-
son. Temple won last year’s meeting in a
defensive struggle, 17-13. The Owls’ last
win at Pitt Stadium, where the game will
be played Saturday, was 28-18 in 1990,
which was also the last time Temple won
more than three games in a season.

Pitt’s last win in the series was two
years ago at home, 5352, and‘ the
Panthers lead the overall series, 20-7-1.
The last three games have been close, and
there is-no reason to believe that trend
won’t continue, as both teams will be
ﬁghting for respect.

THE PITT NEvvs

Cross country finishes behind at Big East

Andrew Jones

For The Pitt News

Pitt athletics teams define them-
selves with three words: “commitment,
teamwork and pride.”

If you throw in youth, inexperience

and underrepresentation, you have the
definition of the cross-country team.
e Last Saturday, ‘ the men’s and
women’s cross-country teams went to
the Big East Championships with their
usual small numbers to compete against
the best runners in the Big East and, in
some cases, the country. Both teams
faced odds that had not changed all sea-
son ¢— bad ones. They were out-
manned and out—classed-. Both the men
and the women finished 12th out of 13
teams.

The men’s team had six‘ competi-
tors whose places ranged from 61st to
113th. The Big East champion,
Providence, had six men who finished
in the top 20, as well as other runners
scattered throughout the ranks.

The top Panther ﬁnisher was Mike _

Orzechowski, who ran the race in-time

of 26 minutes, 8 seconds. He was fol-
lowed by John Becker (83rd, 26:26),
Justin Wiley (96th,27: 18), Kelly Hanlin
(106th,27:48), Kyle Davis
(107th,27:49) and Carl Taylor (1l3th,
28:13).

For the women however, being out-
numbered wasn’t as great a problem as
inexperience. A majority of the Lady
Panther runners were underclassmen.
The only senior was Tamika Dorin,
who placedl04th with a time of 20: 17.

The women were led by Lauren
Fittz (63rd,18:59). She was followed by
Chantee Earl (74th,19:17), Amanda
Schmidt (76th, 19:20), Wendy Lampart
(87th,19:40), Sarah McMillan
(95th,19:56), Danielle Rhodes (106th,
20:29), Ashleigh Grimaldi (l09th,
20:40) and Jessica‘ Raymer (116th,
21:02).

When asked about the entire sea-
son, coach Dave Sobal said that the
women lost only one runner last season
and gained several more. -

He said that next season, he expects

the ‘team to be stronger, wiser and more
_ prepared for. Big East competition.

in the country, but had it not been for a
fluke loss to North Carolina State,._they

would be a top-10 team. If they played »-
in the Big Ten, the Orangemen Icgouldp '

beat every team except Ohio State.‘ '

Virginia Tech, ranked 14th in the
nation, is another legitimate power-
house. The Hokies boast one of the
country’s stingiest defenses, and if it
were not for an unbelievable ﬂuke loss
to lowly Temple, they, too, would be in
the top 10.

Miami is the team that has the best
chance of reaching the elite level. The
Hurricanes were a perennial top-10
team in the ‘80s and early ‘90s, but
NCAA violations reduced their schol-
arships and hurt their ability to recruit.

Miami now has its full slate of
scholarships available and is on its
way back to prominence.

West Virginia is never an elite
team, but it is a consistent top-25 team,
which is good for the conference. But
because it’s West Virginia, I hate the

team and won’t root for it.

Boston College :is another school
that was pretty good not all that long
ago?-. but has fallen _,on hard times
recently. It should be able to be com-
ppetigtiver again beforeitoo long. .

5, [Pitt turned the comer last year, and

it-a__lEh:-ough_ it’s not having a good year,

they program-,*j-is obviously improving.
"Temple and Rutgers have always

sucked, but if they can at least be -

mediocre instead of awful, that would
be a boost.
A good showing in the postseason

this year could have a huge impact on _

the Big East’s ability to gain respect.

So, Pitt fans, if you want what’s
best for Pitt, pull for Syracuse to keep
winning. Pray that Miami and Virginia
Tech impress in postseason bowl
games.

Just don’t root for West Virginia
because they’re a bunch of hicks.

Brian Knavish is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News and would
never root for West Wrginia even if
was playing Penn State.

ed his family to be able to see him play.

If his family had to choose which
games to buy tickets for, the best invest-
ments would have been the games against
ranked opponents. Last year, Gibson’s two
best performances came against Penn
State and West Virginia.

A Gibson’s winning attitude has come
from his experiences in high—school foot-
ball and his experiences’ in big games.

“It teaches you somewhat of a win-

ning attitude, and you hope that carries
over,” said Gibson. “We got a taste of it
last year.”

Gibson was, of course, making refer-
ence to the success of the Panthers last
season and their play in the Liberty Bowl.

As of now, Gibson is majoring in
communication and hopes he can one day
get a job as a sportscaster. That is unless an
NFL team happens to call his name on
draft day. « _

“I would be thankful and would love
to [play in the NFL], but if not, that’s what
we go to school for,” said Gibson.
