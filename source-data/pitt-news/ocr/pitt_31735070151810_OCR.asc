ty sure that [all students] probably

don’t support a change to Gmail.”
In a unanimous decision, the

Board voted last Tuesday to pass a

resolution that urges the University"

to adopt Google’s platform, Google
Apps for Education. The resolution
was introduced at the meeting one
weekbefore and claims ti1at“Google

Google Apps for Education is a

includingGmail and Google Drive. It V

Ahmed, asenior majoringin sociology and

Friday. By'Duesday, 27 students had signed the
petition against Google Apps for Education.
“I’m actually notagainstGoogle, just certain
things,” said Zeba. “It’s in the same format as
the pro-Gmail petition. It’s inthe same format
so it would be comparable.”
Shealso saidthatalthough sheuses aGoogle

Ahmed said shewasproud ofthe discussion

restricts [sic] their actions” when it approved
Section 207.03 of the Elections Code Sept. 17.

Accordingto Section 207.03, all members
of Allocations Committee and chairs of other
committees are prohibited from endorsing
candidates.

The Allocations Committee is responsible
for advisingthe Board inallocatingthe Student
Activities Fee, into which each undergraduate
student pays $80 a semester. Each week, the
committee meets to hear requests ﬁ'om stu-
dent groups and make recommendations on
the requests to the Board for approval during
public meeting.

According to the statement from the Al-

locations Committee, the Board is obligated -

by its code of ethics to recognize its relation-
ship to the committee chairs and members as
“functioning peers rather than subordinates
of the elected Boar .”

The statement also lists a Board of'I'rustees
policythatdictates thatstudentscan“associate
with whomsoever they please.”

The statement contends that endorsing

SGB candidates is included inthis rightto free
association.

he looks forward to hearing Ahmed’s argu-
ments against Google Apps for Education.

“This is the ﬁrst student I’ve heard who is
against it,” Louderback said. “I think that it’s
important to hear what she has to say.”

Louderback met with Vice Provost and
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey and Pitt
ChiefInfor1nationOfﬁcer]inxWaltoninHum—
phrey’s office Monday night.

During their meeting, Louderback pre-
sented the Board’s resolution, and the three
discussed Google Apps for Education.

“In my personal opinion, [Webmail] is not
up—to—datewiththatofoti1erplatforms thatare
available,” Louderback said. “Ithinkthatthere
are few options that the majority of students,
faculty and staff would be familiar with and
Google Mailisthat option.” ’

“whatldidgetoutofthe meetingisthat [the
University is] activelyworkingto ﬁndasolution
to our current system,” said Louderback.

According to Louderback, the University

Board memberSarahW1nston rebuttedthe
statement immediatelyafterMajchrzakread it,
and said thatElections Cormnittee ChairAaron
Gish read his proposed elections code three
times during previous public meetings without
any response fromthe Allocations Committee.

Board member Thomas Jabro asked Maj-
chrzakifhewasthe primaryauthor ofthedrafc.

Majchrzak said that he wrote the draft, but
said that another member of the committee
had ﬁrst approached him about the subject.
The rest of the committee tookvazyingdegrees
of interest in the statement and passed it by a
vote of seven committee members in favor,
four opposed and two abstentions.

Majchizak would not say after the meeting
which member of the committee originally
approached him.

Jabro asked Majchrzak what his role is as
Allocations Committee chair. Majchrzak re-
sponded that he acts as the spokesperson of

the whole committee. Jabro raised concerns -

about Majchrzak inaccurately representingthe
opinion of the committee asthe sole drafter of
the statement. .

“I brought [the statement] up strictly to
get discussion going [among the committee
members] ,” Majchrzak said.

Gish said that he was unconvinced by the

has formed a committee to discuss the differ-
ent potential email platform options, and this
committee is working toward having a differ-
ent operating system in place for the fall 2014
semester: ’

Walton declined to comment on the meet-'

ing, referring questions to Pitt spokesmanjohn
Fedele.'Fedele was unavailable for comment
on Tuesday.

Fedele said in an email last week that the
University is still in the process of evaluating
mail services and is not prepared to discuss
the results of that process.

While Pitt email accounts wouldrunGoogle
services under the Board’s proposed plan, the

UniversityofPittsbu1ghwouldremainthesole 7

owner of all data connected to the accounts.

After U.S.News & World Report released '

its annual university rankings earlier this
month, Google released a statement saying
that72 of the 100 highest-ranked universities
have already introduced Google’s platform on

committee’s statement.

“Given what I heard tonight, I’rn not con-
vinced that there is a well—established reason
to change the code,” Gish said. “I don’t.think
that anything thatwas done duringthe process
of voting in the code was improper.”

Gish said that if an Allocations member or
committee chair supports a candidate inap-
propriately, the member or chair would be
sanctioned. One example of a sanction that
Gish provided was that the candidate would
not be able to attend Elections Committee-
sponsored events . ’

Gish said that he did not know that the Al-
locations Committee took such an issue with
the code until it was read before the 25 or so
people gathered inNordy’s Place oftheW1lliam
Pitt Union, but Majchrzak said that the com-
mittee took issue with the Board’s inability to

their campuses. Google reports that morethan
20 million university and K-12 students use
Google Apps for Education and that operating
Google’s free platform saves the University of
Notre Dame $1.5 million a year.

Representatives for Notre Dame were not
available for comment.’

“You always want to look into what other
schools are doing andtryand stay competitive
with other schoo ,” Ilouderback said.“If we
don’t offer a service that a lot of other schools
offer, it makes us look a lot less attractive.”

Alcom works as a Google student ambas-
sador, promoting Google products and ser-

‘ vices oncampus andactingas aliaisonbetween

Google and Pitt.‘If the University does switch

dent ambassador would work to help educate

convey the impact of the decision.
Board member David Rosenthal pointed
out that chair members were not allowed to
endorse candidates last year and said, “It’s
just a better move to sterilize the committees
so you don’t cause these factions.” --

. Board Member Mike Nites voted against
the Elections Code Sept. 17 because he said

thatthesesections,whichprohibitcommittee 1]

chairs and Allocations Committee members
from endorsing candidates, prevented the
Board fromvoicing its opinion. _
The board defended section207.03, saying
that the committee had enough time to meet
with board members about their concerns
during office hours orraise concerns during
the meetings. '

Louderback said the committee evaluat-
ing options for a switch in Pitt’s email services
has identiﬁed security as the most important
topic and will focus on how the data is stored
and who has access to the Pitt email addresses
under each altefnative.

Ahmed said that the main reason she
started her petition was because of her objec-
tions to Google’s interface and not its security
measures. However, she said that she still had
some reservations about conﬁdentiality for
users ofGoog1e Apps for Education.

Alcom said Google employees would not
have access to data stored in University ac-
counts. T

“When you [ask], ‘Can Google see data on
any Google products?’Ithinkwhat people are

rea1lyaskingis,‘Isahumanreadingmystuff?”’ .

Alcom said.

“Absolutely not,” he said,’ answering his
own question.

While Google would not have access to
University data, an account administrator as-
signed by Pitt would have access to any data
stored in University accounts, including email.
However, this would not be a change from cur-

rent Universitypractice. With EnterpriseMail,
administrators are also assigned to manage
student and faculty data. A’

Corporate offices for Google and]2 Global
Communications — the company that owns
EnterpriseMail —- were unavailable for com-
ment. ,

According to the Office of Computing Ser-
vices and Systems Development, University and
administrative units are currently grouped into
divisions referredto as“responsibility centers.”
These responsibility centers are overseen by an
administrator. Some examples of the divisions
thatform responsibility centersarethe School
of Law and the School of Medicine. Regional
campuses are grouped as separate centers.

The administrator’s role is to ensure ac-
curate data, allocate resources as intended,
create new email accounts and answer ques-
tions students have abouttheir email accounts.

For commercial Gmail accounts, namely
those not connected to the organizations ed-
ucation platform, Google uses an algorithm
to scan through the user’s information. This
information is then used to generate targeted
advertisements tailored to those users’ indi-
vidual interests, according to Adam Lee, an
assistant professor in Pitt’s Department of
Computer Science.

Roulrnr

Lee added that those who currently opt to
forward messages from their pitt.edu email
addresses to their commercial Gmail accounts
allow Google to use their information forthese
advertising purposes.

Alcom said that accounts connected to
Google Apps for Education differ from com-
mercial email accounts because they are not
data-mined for advertisements. While Google
would not generate revenue through advertise-
ments, asthe organization does with commer-
cialaccounts, Googlebeneﬁtsby exposingusers
to Google products in the hope that students
andfaculty would continue to use them outside
of the University.

Ifthe universitywere to adoptthe platform,
information thatis currentlyon Pittservers -
such as email messages and account informa-
tion— would need to be transferred over to
Google’s servers.

Google stores data from accounts using a
program called Google Cloud.

“Cloud is just the computation and the stor-

age is outsourced to somebody else,” said_Lee. .

Ifa company has extra storage capability
and processing power on machines that are
currently idle, the companycanchoose to rent

the storage and processing power to other in-
dividuals. , ’

“Cloud is as much a marketing word as it

. as atechnology advancement,” Lee continued.

“The idea of expanding the capacity you need
on demand, that’s the key idea.” '

Google stores and distributes data in com-
puters at data centers located throughout the
world.

 saidthis complicates privacy standards
regarding data because different countries have
different privacy agreements.

“It’s like any sort of international com-
merce, international travel,” Lee said. “It’s
always more complicated than travel within
borders.”

“Ithinkthatthe bigthingisthatyou need to
be careﬁil when your data leaves your control,
making sure that it’s going to be protected,”
Lee said.

Alcom said that the transition process to
Google from any otherplatformgenerallytakes
about a year for a university of Pitt’s size.

“As a constant user, I certainly don’t see a
downside of this,” he said. “It saves University
money, it’s greener. It’s abetter product. Ithink

‘ any time you have a transition, people are go-

ing to complain about different things. But I
think in the long run, it’s absolutely the best
decision for Pitt.”

COLUMN

‘Grand Theft Auto’ poses critical take

on society, deserves credit

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

The release of the newest install-
ment in the “Grand Theft Auto”
video game series this past week
came with a whole list of expecta-
tions. If we believe that history has
a habit of repeating itself, we know
that the launch of “Grand Theft
Auto Five” will crush sales records,
achieve near-perfect reviews from
critics and will inevitably prompt
adolescents across the nation to
spray machine-gun bullets on busy
parkways or shoot their grandmas.

Historically, in both of the latter
scenarios, pundits and talk show
hosts have claimed that there was a
correlation between crime and the
“matur ’-rated video game series.
Never mind that there’s a link be-

‘ V tween similar acts and a person’s

proximity to high—powe-red w-

ons, though, because “Grand Theft
Auto” is a drug more powerful than
heroin, causing people to commit
atrocities that are inhuman, accord-
ing to Fox News.

But based on their comments, it
seems that not too many members
of the mainstream media have actu-
ally played the game. Perhaps it’s
because becoming addicted to this
mind-altering drug is justtoo risky.
Yet, it’s seemingly easy for those
who don’t even know the series to
say that “Grand Theft Auto” is solely
“a realistic game that has been as-
sociated with encouragingviolence
[and awarding] points to players for
killing people,” as stated by CNN.

Clearly, some people still cannot
accept the stark realism that video
games today portray violence the
same way cinema has done for de-
cades. For instance, less than a day
into its release, “Grand.Theﬁ Auto

Five” sparked controversy over a
very graphic torture scene in the
game. The characters in the game
use “enhanced interrogation” tech-
niquesto obtain information abouta
suspected terrorist. Sound familiar?
In the ﬁlm “Casino,”Joe Pesci’s char-
acter places a man’s hand in a vice
in order to elicit information about
who ordered his crew to sabotage a
restaurant.. Could that be consid-
ered “enhanced interrogation”?

So, what’s the difference be-
tween violence in a ﬁlm such as
“Casino” and violence in “Grand
Theft Auto”?

Perhaps its because some sects
of society, like the media, still view
video games as entertainment only
for children. “Grand Theft Auto” is
the perfect example of the extent to
which games have grown up over

VOUTSINOS

the years. Withasteadily agingdemographic
playingthese games, theyareusually only able
to sell them if they are relatable to a mature
audience. Therefore, video games are inevi-
tably goingto contain violence and story lines
that can be despondently realistic. Obviously
then, mature-rated games, like R—rated mov-
ies, are not for kids.

Unfortunately, until the video game in-

dustry reaches the same level of respect as
cinema, games cannot truly be appreciated
as a form of expression, or even art. This is a
shame for titles such as “Grand Theft Auto.”
For those who actually do know the game, itis
something much deeper than mere shootouts
and explosions. In fact, its popularity lies not
in its ability to satisfy the player’s bloodlust,
but in its accurate and somewhat hilarious

- portrayal of American culture. So contrary

to some media sources-, it’s not the mindless
acts of violence but the sophisticated satire

movies cannot achieve overwhelming success
on all action and no plot, video games cannot
sell on asinine bloodshed alone.

Former “Grand Theft Auto” writer Brian
Baglow sums up the game’s versatility well:
“GTA [...] as it’s been set in a contemporary
environment, it has acted like a black mirror
set up against society.” He goes on to describe
the game series’ satirical elements. “What GTA

» does is it actually takes the American culture

as we understand it from movies — it’s every
gangster movie, it’s every crime caper,” he
said. It’s ironic that the same movies that the

game parodies do not receive nearly as much
media condemnation, if any.

Nonetheless, we can hope that as a genera-
tion driven by video games comes of age, the
games will eventually cease to be blamed for
certain crimes. And as more people who un-
derstand video games become adults, maybe
future “Grand Theft Auto” games will be able
to hit the market without sparking public
disapproval.

COLUMN

Sanchez an
unsung hero
in playoff run

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pirates clinched a playoff spot last night,
and as weird as it feels to type those words,
it felt even mo re surreal to watch the cham-
pagne showers and goggled players celebrate
in their visitor’s clubhouse.

As the Root Sports telecast broadcast
the Pirates’ celebration in Chicago, the sta-
tion’s reporters interviewed players to ask
them about the key components to the team’s
success.

They spoke with Andrew McCutchen,
whose legitimately venerable expression
gave me goosebumps; Pedro Alvarez, who
was touted for his role in the team’s turn-
around; manager Clint Hurdle, who manned
the righting of the ship, and general manager
Neal Huntington, who ﬁrst burned down
the miniscule semblance of structure left
by -his predecessor, Dave Littleﬁeld, then
resurrected the organization.

Lost in the gala was catcher Tony San-
chez. Limited to a reserve role for the major-

ity of his season, Sanchez was not nearly as

critical to the team’s success as McCutchen
or Alvarez.

He is, however, one of the chief reasons
that the team did not fall out of the playoff
picture in the second half of the season.

When discussing Sanchez, it’s important
to consider three things: His pedigree, his
path to the majors and the incompetence
of Michael McKenry, who began the year as
a backup catcher.

McKenry is impossible to despise — even
when he spent his 122 plate appearances
hitting a ﬁitile .217 with a .262 on-base per-
centage and a .348 slugging percentage. The
guy is illuminating, consistently beaming a
smile and forever praising his teammates.
But he was simply awful this year before be-

FOOTBALL

Dedication drives Brown to academic success

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Wrz'ter

Desmond Brown knows what it is like to be
under pressure.

Though the redshirt senior running back
has received limited carries in the backﬁeld,
he has been aﬁxture on the Panthers’ special
teams units for the past two seasons. In2011,
Brown was the No. 2_ back on the depth chart
behind then-junior Ray Graham. But at this
stage in his college career, Brown is feeling a
little less pressure on the gridiron  he is in
another competitive ﬁeld: the business ﬁeld.

Brown has taken the road less traveled to
get to this stage in both his academic and ath-
letic careers, graduatingfrom MiamiNorland
High School —— his fourth area high school —
in Miami, Fla., in2009 with a2.3 GPA. Brown
then enrolled at Miami—Dade College, a school
without a football team.

“In high school, Iwas just playingfootball,”
Brown said. “I didn’t pay much attention to
school. When graduation time came, I realized
I had to turn it on, so I went to a community
college with no football team, all academics,
and I graduated.”

The commitment to academics at Miami-
Dade College paid oif,'as a 3.75 GPA and an
associate’s degree catapulted him to restart
his football—playing career while studying
business at a Division I institution.

Brown’s search for a suitor began at an ex-
citingtime for his family. Desmond’s brother,
Antonio, had just been draﬁ:ed by the Pitts-
burgh Steelers in the sixth round after an illus-
trious tl1ree—year career at Central Michigan.

Desmond’s college selection became much
easier after the Steelers selected. Antonio,
making the chance to stay close to his brother
— the Panthers and Steelers share a facility
on the South Side — one he could not pass up.

A December 2011 article by Dan Gigler of
the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette explained that the
Brown brothers’ upbringing in the northwest
section of Miami, a hardscrabble area known
for its high levels of poverty and crime, forged
a c1ose—l<nit relationship between the two. The
brothers’ bond helped them to avoid being
sucked into the streets of Miarni’s Liberty City
neighborhood.

“My brother is probably my biggest inﬂu-
ence,” Brown said. “He is always telling me to
make sure I have good grades. Sometimes he
will motivate me with, ‘if you make the honor
roll,’ he will reward me with something nice.
So that always helped me keep focus.”

Brown could have played on a scholarship
elsewhere, the Post-Gazette reported in its
2011 Antonio Brown story— even in his home
state of Florida. But the chance to reunite with
his brother and play football at Pitt was one
he simply could not passlup.

Since getting to Pittsburgh in 2011, Des-
mond knew to continue pursuing academics
with the same passion he demonstrated for
his athletic endeavors.

“I still keep my academics as a high prior-
ity, just trying to stay true to that,” he said.
“In order for me to get the internships I have
gotten, I had to have a certain GPA, so that

Brown’s focus earned him two internships. Sheldon Satenstein |AssistantVisuaI Editor

just shows how academics really pays off in
the long run.”

Those other opportunities of the ﬁeld be-
gan coming to fruition when Brown received
his ﬁrst internship offer at BNY Mellon in
the human resources department during the
summer of 2011.

“Welinked him up with some alumni
through networking events and he was able to
network with agentleman from BNY Mellon,
and next thing you know he is going for inter-
views,” assistant athletic director for student
life Penny Semaia said. “We helped highlight

 

his strengths, working on everything from . .._.

resume review to how to start conversations
and he has been a proactive participant in
getting prepared for that next stage oflife and
has taken well advantage of it in his time here.”

PECYNA

Tony Sanchez has hit .255 with two homers in his first 20 career games. MCT Campus

ing shelved for the season after tearing the
lateral meniscus in his left knee onjuly 27.
McKenry — known as “The Fort” be-
cause of his last name’s similarity to Fort
McHenry in Baltimore and perhaps more
5 subtly for a positively embracive demeanor
— was as deﬁcient at throwing out base
stealers as he was at swinging the bat.

EnterTony Sanchez: formerfourth-over—e v

all, easy—sign, high—rise pick in the 2009
ﬁrst—year player draft, Twitter aﬁcionado
and two—time recipient of a broken jaw -
once in 2010 as a result of being hit by a
pitch, the other from a reported bar ﬁght
following the 2011 season.

When the Pirates selected Sanchez that
early in the draft, their goal was to pass
on perceivably tough signees in the ﬁrst
round — high-school players with soaring
potential like Zack Wheeler, Shelby Miller,
Jacob Turner, Mike Trout and Wil Myers —

’ and save money by nabbing players with
equally high upside who were predicted
to be selected in the draft’s later rounds.
Sanchez and Turner are the only players
of that group who have acclimated to the
majors slowly. The others burst onto the
scene with remarkable rookie debuts.

The Pirates signed Sanchez for $2.5
million. Only Wheeler, the sixth pick, and
Miller, the 19th, received higher signing
onuses — $3.3.mill.ion.and $2.87 million,

respectively.

Sanchez was inconsistent in his ﬁve years
in the minors, with his most promising cam-
paign coming this year at triple—A India-
napolis. In 296 plate appearances there, he
posted an .872 on—base plus slugging.

While Sanchez hasn’t exactly duplicated
those numbers since joining the big-league
club — you can’t depend on a rookie to do
so —. he has been an outstanding reserve,
standing in for starting catcher Russell Mar-
tin when called upon.

Sanchez, through a small 61—plate ap-
pearance sample, has looked decent in his
ﬁrst 20 major-league games. He’s hit .255
with a .311 on-base percentage and a .436
slugging percentage. However, Sanchez has
walked at an uncharacteristically low rate
(4.9 percent) and struck out a bit more than
he did in the minors. This isn’t completely
unexpected, as most rookies struggle with
plate discipline in their ﬁrst trial in the big
leagues. _

Consider that McKenry’s 2013 campaign
resulted in a .271 weighted on-base average,
a stat that encompasses and properly weighs
offensive values. Sanchez, meanwhile, has
posted a .326 weighted on—base average. An
average mark is about .320.

That 55-point differential between McK-

Representatives from BNY Mellon were un-
available for comment.

After completing his summer stint in hu-
man resources, Brown returned to BNY Mel—
lon the following summer as a private wealth
management intern.

“I have learned a lot and met a lot of great
people in a very professional setting [at BNY
Mellon] ,” he said.

Part of the role a student-athlete fulﬁlls is,
of course, being a stand-up teammate. And
despite Brown’s extracurricular activities, fel-
low running back Rachid Ibrahim attests to
Brown’s amiability in the social world.

“All the running backs, we all hang out
together outside of football,” Ibrahim told
The Pitt News after training camp in August.
“We go out to eat as a group and things like
that — just running—back time.”

Brown, who j oined the team as awalk-on in
2011, was rewarded by head coach Paul Chryst

V for his hard work on and off the ﬁeld with an
athletic scholarship this past May.
‘Semaia said Chryst and his staff have done
a great job stressing to every single player the
importance of1ife—skills training, even during
the offseason.

Brown is just one shining example of the
program’s success.

“I always say hard work pays off,” Brown
said. “I believe everything happens for a ma?
son. If you just stay positive and work hard,
I believe things will pay off in some kind of
way, even if it is not the way you wanted to.”

ﬁﬁa

enry and Sanchez is massive. It’s the differ-
ence between San Francisco Giants catcher
Buster Posey and Giants shortstop Brandon
Crawford. If you align the numbers for other
players, Sanchez is similar to Giants third
baseman Pablo Sandoval, while McKenry
is comparable to Chicago Cubs shortstop
Starlin Castro.

Add in Sanchez’s superior pitch framing
and defensive prowess and the Pirates have
an outstanding option for Martin’s backup
—— and possible starter in the next two years.

So although Sanchez is not an All-Star
backstop just yet, Pittsburgh should be con-
tent with his contribution and his.role on
a —— wait for it — playoff team. §
