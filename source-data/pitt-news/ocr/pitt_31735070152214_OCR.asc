STUDENT GOVERNMENT

  Candidates

  extended

Danielle Fox
T Staff W riter
Campaign season for the Student Government
Board is less than aweek away, and some of the
candidates will be late to the party.
Althoughwednesdaywas thedeadline for
applications to run for SGB, the Board received
fewer applicationsthan expected. Last year,
there were 18 students nmning for positions
on the Board. Roughly halfthat amount have
turned in applications thus far, according to

Aaron Gish, chairman of the Elections Comé

rnittee. Because of the limited number of ap-
plicants, Gish has extended the application
deadline to Nov. 2 at 5 p.m. I
“Technically, we do have enough people
that there will be a Board next year,” he said.
“But I think everybody is pretty much in agree-
ment that it would be nice if there were more
options to get students to vote on electionlday.”
Because there were students who did turn
their packets in by the original deadline, cam-
paigning for those candidates will begin on

Most people will never have to imagine what
life is like without a face. fl '

But for more than 16,000 military ser-
vicemembers severely wounded in battle
in Afghanistan and Iraq, coping with burns,

amputations and injuries to the head and
face are part of everyday life.

In 2008, the U.S. Department of Defense
establishedthe Armed Forces Institute of
Regenerative Medicine program and chose
the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC,
along with Wake Forest University, tore-
ceive $45 million to develop new technolo-

second phase of the project. I

for Military Medicine Research, a j oint pro-
gram of Pitt and UPMC, said there is a real
need to research ways of repairing tissue.

“Because of excellent body armor now,”
Tuan said, “most injuries are not lethal.” .

He went on to say the survival rate for
injured U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan
has been greater than 90 percent.

“It’s very rare to get internal organ inju-
ries,” he said. “Therefore, the injuries are
in the extremities, the limbs and the head.”

Tuan is Pitt’s executive vice-chairman of
orthopedic surgery, the associate director
of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative
Medicine, and the director of the Center for
Cellular and Molecular Engineering.

The Pittsburgh research team is focused

October 25. 2013 I The Pitt News I vvvvvv.pittnevvs.com

“ on treating injuries in ﬁve different areas:

treatment for craniofacial injuries, which
affect the face and head; limb and digit
salvage; burn treatment; scarless wound
healing, and dealing with compartment
syndrome, which occurs when pressure
builds up from swelling or bleeding within
a healed wound. a

One new procedure the Pittsburgh team 4

developed for treating burns involves a de-
vice that researchers refer to as a skin gun.
The skin gun was developed by the Pitts-
burgh research team during the past four
years, and is presently used in clinical trials.

“You put stem cells into a spray gun,”
said Tuan. “The stem cells can be sprayed
upon the wounded area or the Burn area,
and we can reconstruct the skin.”

These stem cells come from the bone
marrow or fat tissue of the wounded person.
Stem cell research is a big part of his team’s

approach, not only inburn healing, but
also in facial regeneration and in restoring
function to injuredjoints-.

Another new procedure that is presently

going through clinical trials is a total hand
transplant.—.It’s a difficult procedure not
only because of the complex surgery but
also because of the immune system’s ten-

dency to reject a foreign limb. In addition,

there is only a small window of time during

which an organ donor’s limbs would be vi- ~

able. According to Tuan, UPMC is the most
advanced hand transplant institute in the
U.S., having completed eight transplants.

Matthew Hannan is aU.S. Marine Corps
veteran and the president of Pitt Vets, an
on-campus support and mentoring network
for student veterans. He is also a research
assistant at Pitt’s Human Engineering Re-
search Laboratories, where he works with
wounded veterans.

Hannan said that maintaining inde-
pendence and reintegrating with society
are often two of the biggest challenges for
injured veterans. These new regenerative

therapies could help veterans to overcome l

those challenges.

Hannan could think of many examples
of veterans who could beneﬁt from new
procedures.  ‘ V > » A it

For example, Hannan said that a vet-
eran who receives a limb transplant might
therefore not needto rely on a motorized
wheelchair or a robotic arm to assist in han-
dling objects. Or in the case of burn victims,
a successful craniofacial procedure may
make a veteran more comfortable going
out in public and less likely to be sunbumed
when exposed to ‘sunlight.

weak or sick or hurt, but we want to be

He said there was a serious risk with
some of the new procedures. For example,
a surgery that doesn’t go well could further
isolate or demoralize a veteran. Hannan
noted that these procedures are optional

Gish said candidates already set up ap-
pointments with organizations to address
students before thedeadline was extended,
and he did not think it would be fair to force
the candidates to reschedule those events.

Forthe latecomers, campaigningwill begin
on Nov. 4.

The date set for the election, Nov. 21, has
not changed.

Gish said he does not think this will in-

terfere with the elections results; Last year,
students had roughly 21 days to campaign.
This year, they will have about 17 days.

He also said that this year’s application A

packets were advertised more than in previ-
ous years. _

Although Gish said he was optimistic that
more applications would come inbefore the
new deadline, he said he couldn’t explain the
shortage in applicants so far this year.

“I don’t really know what the exact reason
was,” Gish said. “I would be inclined to say it
was a ﬂuke, but I have no clue.” I

treatments that require patient consent
before they can be conducted.

According to Ron Poropatich, the ex-
ecutive director of the Center for Military
Medicine Research, research on regenera-
tive medicine, while focused on helping vet-
erans, will ultimately beneﬁt all of society.

“Every problem we have in the mili-

tary exists in the civilian sector, as well,”

said Poropatich. “So the relevance doesn’t
change, it’s just that the priority is greater.”
Poropatich is a retired U.S. Army colonel
who has worked for 30 years in military

medicine research and acts as a facilitator
for both military and Pitt researchers. He
described a new technology called high-
deﬁnition ﬁber tracking, which will help
treat traumatic brain injuries. V

High—deﬁnition ﬁber tracking takes MRI V

images and processes them through a com-
plex algorithm. The data is uploaded to a
portable device such as an iPad, allowing
veterans with traumatic brain injuries to
work with rehabilitators to see precisely
what areas of the brain are damaged —— a
process that can lead to highly customized

rehabilitation.

“[A traumatic brain injury] islike can-
cer,” said Poropatich. “There are different
degrees and different levels, [but] you have
to treat it in a very individualized way.”

He also said that high—deﬁnition ﬁber
tracking would also have implications in
treating Alzheimer’s and autism.

Being racist: Nobody is immune

Natalie Russell
Columnist

If you don’t think you’re racist,
you probablyare. At least, that’s
what Harvard’s Implicit ‘Associa-‘
tion Test indicated. , .

I like to think of myself as pro-
gressive and well-versed in race
issues, so I took the Implicit As-
sociation Test to feel superior. My
results indicated a “strong auto-
matic preference for whites.” At
ﬁrst I was shocked, embarrassed
and disappointed. Butl realized I
wasn’t alone:‘7o percent of all test
takers indicated a preference for
whites, with only 17percent fall-
ing into a neutral category, This
is among all races. ,_

After getting over the shame
of feeling like a fraud, I realized
that my belief that I was immune —

to racism was much more prob- .

lematic than my results. The truth
is that racism is conditioned and
systematic, and just because I
voted for President Barack Obama
doesn’t mean Igwill neverbase de-

cisions on racist assumptionsor

make judgments subconsciously
inﬂuenced by the race of the ac-
cused. This reﬂexive response is
obviously indicative of a major
problem that deserves attention,
but a morepressing, immediate
problem is the inability of whites
to admittheir, own capacity for
racism..

Malcolm Gladwell’s bestsell-
ing book “Blirik,” which is ‘about
thinking without thinking, cited
a 2008 study by researchers An-
thony Greenwald of the Univer-
sity of Washington and Mahzarin
Banaji of Harvard, which relied on
ﬁndings from a computerized Im-
plicit Association Test like the one

I took. The test asked respondents
to sort certain concepts into cat-
egories. For example, the top left
of the screen would read “.Black”
and the top right of the screen
would read. “White.” Aword in the
middle would mention something
like a name or a characteristic,

and then ask respondents to sort

the information in a couple of sec-
onds using the designated left and
right keys. g

Gladwell himself received a
score of “moderate automatic
preference for whites,” while
Greenwald and Banaji received
equally pro—white results.

Another part of the test fea-
tured “White/Good” in the left-

’ hand corner and “Black/Bad” in
the right-hand corner. The mid-

dle of the screen would display

phrases like “happiness” or “guilt” and .

ask respondents to sort them into which-
ever category they deemed appropriate.
Researchers found that when the catego-
ries switched to “White/Bad” and “Black/
Good,” responses were much slower. From
this, they deduced that-the tendency to
associate negative concepts with the color
black were much mo re reﬂexive. This effect

October 25. 2018 [ The Pitt News I vwvvvpiIInevvs.cem

goes beyond color names, however. Black
and white faces were used in place of the

.. ' color names in portions of the test, and saw.

similar results. Anyone can take this test in
just a few minutes at implicit.harvard.edu.

Few would admitthey’re racist. Few
would admit they’re sexist, either. I’m a
woman and a feminist, but I catch myself
making sexist reﬂexive judgments all the
time. It’s so deeply ingrained in our cul-
ture and in the American psyche that this
behavior and mindset doesn’t even stand
out. It’s easy not to question.

Greenwald and Banaji stated, “People
who hold egalitarian—conscious attitudes
in the face of automatic white preferences
may be able to function in nonprejudiced
fashion partly by making active efforts to
prevent their automatic white preference
from producing discriminatory behavior.”
In other words, you’re more likely to be rac-
ist if you don’t think you are. If you want to
see this in action, just go ahead and search
Twitter for the phrase “I’m not racist, but.”

“Progressive” white people are part of
the problem —— we think we’re officially

5

immune to being racist because of a few so-
ciology courses, despite the pervasiveness

. of these messages in the media,.education .
and American culture. By theway,;fellow V

white people, advocating for racial equal-
-ity isn’t something for which you should

pat yourself on the back. It’scalled being

a decent human being.

" So, yes, maybe you voted for Obama,
maybe you dated a black person once, may-
be you listen to Beyonce and Lil Wayne. It
doesn’t exonerate you from being racist.

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football encounters two weeks of option-
based offenses, startingthisweek atthe home
of the Navy Midshipmen. Head coach Paul

— Chryst said the team has been preparing this

style of offense since training camp, and Sat-
urday provides further practice for Georgia
Tech, the Panthers’ opponent on Nov. 2.

“The next two weeks are totally different
than whatwe saw earlier,” Chryst said. “I feel
good about our guys and we spent some time
in camp on [the option offense]. Our guys
should have a good idea of what to expect to
face on Saturday.”

Pitt (4-2, 2-2 ACC) takes abreak from ACC
play this week when the Panthers head to
Annapolis, Md., for a matchup Saturday at
1 p.m. with the Midshipmen (3-3) at Navy
Memorial Stadium. -

“Navy presents some challenges for us de-
fensively, as they have a style that we need to
prepare for,” Chryst said. “Offensively, we’re
preparing for a team that is a little different
defensively, so we have to have a good week
of preparation.”

That style is the vaunted triple—option
offense, which has propelled Navy to the
nation’s sixth-best rushing attack at just over

Basketball scrimmage  slate of Weekend sports action

Mark Powell
Staff W riter

Pitt’s volleyball, swimming and diving teams
will all face tough road tests this weekend,
while the'men’s basketball team is set to
play its ﬁrst exhibition game of the season.

Men’s Basketball

The Panthers hope to make a statement
Friday night as they play their ﬁrst exhi-
bition matchup of the season against the
University of California—San Diego at the
Petersen Events Center.

The game will mark the start of an excit-
ing and unpredictable season for the Pan-
thers, whose roster features several dif-

ferent players from last year’s team. This
year also marks Pitt’s ﬁrst season in the
ACC, which is widely considered the best
basketball conference in the country.

Pitt’s starting lineup is in ﬂux, as the Pan-
thers must ﬁnd replacements for guard Tray
Woodall, who graduated after last season,
and Steven Adams, who was taken 12th
overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder in
the NBA draft. The Panthers are likely to
replace their production with a number of
incoming freshmen and transfers who look
to make an immediate impact.

Pitt is coming off two blue-gold scrim-
mages, meaning this is the ﬁrst time they
will face an opposing team in this early

start to the season. Lamar Patterson and
Cam Wright — who each had more than 20
points in both exhibition games —— created
the most buzz following the scrimmages.

Swimming and Diving

The men’s and women’s swimming and
diving teams travel to Bucknell this week-
end for the second meet of the season. The
Panthers are coming off a season-opening
win against St. Bonaventure last Saturday
in which both the men’s and women’s teams
were able to secure victories.

The women’s team was especially domi-
nant in the victory, taking 14 of 16 ﬁrst-place
ﬁnishes, while the men fought back against

the defending Atlantic 10 champions with _

two ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes by Luke Nosbisch
and Scott Simmer.

In diving, Pitt had multiple ﬁrst-place
ﬁnishers on both teams. I-Iarris Bergman
and Aaron Snyder took ﬁrst place for the
men, while‘-5§I‘ori Brungo and Rachel Saun-
ders won for the women.

Pitt should expect tough competition
Saturday in Lewisburg, Pa., because Buck-
nell also won its ﬁrst meet of the season
against George Washington University.

Volleyball

The Pitt volleyball team looks to rebound
in North Carolina after losing three of its

last four matches against ACC opponents.

   

The Panthers face North Carolina State I

Friday, then travel to Chapel Hill, N .C., Sat-

’ urday to play No. 14 North Carolina. The Tar

Heels will be the third ranked team that the
Panthers have played this season. Pitt lost
to the previous two.

Despite the team’s recent struggles,

Coach Dan Fisher still believes the Panthers

are right where they need to be.
A “Whether we win or lose, we try to keep

 

our focus [by] getting better every day and
competing,” Fisher said. “We are 4-4 in a
very tough league.” ‘

Still, the Panthers will need a valiant ef-
fort to come out of this weekend road trip
with a win. T

Pitt does not have much history with
either of these teams. The Panthers haven’t
played the Wolfpack‘ since 1983 and last
matched up against the Tar Heels in 2004.

“Most of these gyms are new to us and
we want to make sure our players are com-
fortable with the new surroundings,” Fisher

said. “We are looking forward to a competi- V

tive match.” E
