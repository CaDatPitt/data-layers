American Legion Resolves
To Influence Legislature

(See Editorial, Page 4) -
Members of the American Legion’s Pennsylvania Depart-
mentrecently passed a resolution favoring continuance of the
University’s ROTC program. Submitted from the floor by the
National Executive Committeeman, Daniel A. Drew of Pitts-
burgh, the resolution also announced Legion support of the pro-

’ gram’s being granted full academic credit.

A release dated Jan. 18 reportsthat “The resolution further rec-.
ommends that failure to reinstate credits for ROTC by the University
of Pittsbourgh should result in the withholding of state financial assis-

tance to the institution.”

Copies of the resolution were
sent to Governor Raymond Shaf-
er, University Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, Pennsylvania legislative
leaders, and the Pennsylvania di-
rector of Public Instruction.

“The University’s actions to
delete credits for ROTC partici-
pation,” the resolution says, “will
have an adverse effect upon the
defense capacity of the United
States” and “may make it neces-

sary to eliminate the program due

to lack of interest.”

Citing the achievements of the
American Legion, the release re-
ports, “The American Legion of
Pennsylvania, which has more
than a quarter of a million mem-
bers, has an excellent record of
obtaining favorable results, leg-
islative and otherwise, through its
resolutions, not only for the bene-
fit of veterans, but also in other
areas such as child _welfare, the
general welfare of all citizens,

and benefifts to servicemen.”

 

The AmericanvLegion’s Penn-
sylvania Department also passed
two other resolutions. One gave
support to the police, while the-
other recognized the bravery of
an off-duty policeman.

Urban. Historian Puts

Problem in Perspective  

by SANDRA DeVIRGILIO
Staff News Writer

Urbanhistorian Dr. Walter
Glazer, in his lecturelon Wednes-
day evening in the Student Un-
ion, maintained that the histori-
an’s role is not to solve problems
in the real world, but to place
present problems in historical
perspective.

Dr. Glazer of the University’s
Department of History became
interested in urban problems
while working on a Ford Founda-
tion project in Michigan.

(For another lecture in ‘this
series, see Dr. Crawford’s discus-
sion, page three.) -

A “new breed,” the urban his-
torian differs from his predeces-
sor in both his choice of topics
for study and in his approaches
to these topics. Focusing on the
processes that have shaped urban
history, Dr. Glazer dealt with
those problems which presently
concern almost all of the social
sciences: population growth, “ur-

ban sprawl,” 'social structures,
and ghettos.

Of the three sources of popula-
tion growth in the 19th century-
births, migration from rural areas
and immigration—the most impor-
tant was iTnmigration. The large
percentage of foreign inhabitants
explains the character and qual-
ity of the 19th century city. Pop-
ulation patters overtime showed
great instability, 60,p.e,r Cent 0f
the population of a given area
changing in a three to five year
period. a

The Civil War brought frag-
mentation and specialization in
industry and a corresponding
change in city structure. The
wealthy, possessing means of

transportation, moved outside of »

the city; This movement to subur-
ban areas contributed to the
growth of ghettosand slum areas,
as the poor moved into the va-
cated residential areas. By the
20th century, cities had acquired

Senate Passes Bill To 

by DAVE TIERNAN
Staff News Editor

'Ken Schueler and SG ‘68 wrapped up their careers within
final meeting Wednesday evening, and the Senate passed thre
bills by large majorities. A

a bill supporting the demands and action of the Black Action Societ
was passed by a 13-3 margin.

(The bill appears in complete
form on this page.)

In addition to voting infavor
of three allocations, the Senate
voted 17-1 in support of President
Ken Schueler’s proposals for stu-
dent representation on the Fac-
ulty Senate Council and a_ stand-
ing committee including students,
faculty and administration to in-
itiate community government.

Many of'the newly—elected
senators attended their first SG
meeting as members of the au-
dience. The new Senate received
many words of inspiration at the
end of the meeting when each
senator had to ‘air his
or her feelings about their past
year on the SG Senate.

One of the points that thema-

in their farewell talks was the
fact that the Seante should be re-

Attempt to Bridge Communication Gap 9

Seminar Presents Careers

JUNE RUBEL, PESO

“It is almost impossible to find
out where you belong. So, the sys-
tem- seems stupid. P91‘ 11395 I195‘
tile to you. The world seems rig-
ged like a maze where they induce

neurosis into rats.” Peter Druck-
er, writing in Careers Today points
out one of the most important di-
lemmas facing college student
a_nd graduates.

The Career Seminar Series is a
new effort to change this state
of affairs — an attempt to bridge
the communication gap between
University students and poten-
tial employers. The Career Sem-
inar will bring “career exemp-
lars” from many fields.

' These young successful repre-
sentatives will participate in in-
formal dialogues‘ with small
groups of undergraduates. Stu-
dents will be able to talk to young
men and women —- many of them
recent graduates — to find out
exactly how it is in the work
world. The Career Seminar will
be an exciting departure from the
traditional lecture and printed list
of starting salaries and fringe
benefits.

These man and women are
not going to be recruiting. They
will be here to share their ex-
periences with college students —
to open a window to the world that
is possible after graduation,
and perhaps to inspire students
to create a careerrather than
merely to look for a job or a haven
in graduate school.

Although there is no shortage
of positions for college train-
ed people, we know that many
graduates do not find satisfying
work. For 50 per cent of all college
graduates leave their first A jobs
within three years. Mr. Drucker
blames what he calls an “infor-
mation blackout.” “The opportun-
ities are there, indeed we are
swamped by them. Never before
has there been such variety, such
diversity of need for people to do
things that have never been done
before.” ’

There are, for example, 20,-
000 positions in, city planning
which must be filled in the next
few years. Both local and federal
government are badly in need of
talented people. Expanded govern-
ment activities that are sprout-
ing in many’ agencies require

Just talk to the man from General Electric.

He represents 170 separate GE “companies” that
deal in everything from space research to electric
toothbrushes. And each of these product depart-
ments is autonomous. Each has its own manage-
ment and business objectives.

So a job at General Electric offers the kind of
immediate responsibility you might expect to ﬁnd
only in a small business.

Right from the start you get a chance to demon-
strate your initiative and capabilities. And the
more you show us, the faster you’ll move ahead.

in the same place. We have operations all over the

more than one of them.

The medical and paramedical

This is but a sample of the areas
where college trained people are
needed to perform necessary
services and to create new kinds
of careers to meet the needs of

dents have any idea about the op-

how to distinguish exciting jobs

‘Can’t Survive Without Sense Of Humor’

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

The stereotype of an English
teacher is not very complimen-
tary to them. English teachers are
thought of as being very prudent,
old fashioned, hard to get along
with, and as having an affinity
against smiling.

If these’ things were truly char-
acteristic of them, then English
professor Dr. Myron Taube should
be anything but a teacher. Dr.
Taube’s freshman English lec-
tures are always crowded. He
makes his students actually want
to come to class, because in his
lectures the students not only
learn, but enjoy themselves
while learning. ’

Dr.'Taube adds his own person-
ality to his lectures, and many
times the personalities of his stu-

. dents. It is not uncommon for Dr.
, Taube to be talking about some-

thing like a dangling participle,
and suddenly find himself talking
about a grocery store near his
home. This is just the sort of
man he is. He doesn’t try to talk
over any of his student’ heads.
Dr. Taube can see important mean-
ings in the simplestof everyday
events, and relate them in some
way to English writing.

If a person had never seen Dr.
Taube before, all that person
would have to do is hear him say
one word, to know that Dr. Taube

is from the Bronx of New York. _

He got all his degrees at NYU,
and came to the University of
Pittsburgh in 1966.

Dr. Taube commented on many
of the problems of today’s college
student among them the English
classroom size. “This is only my
opinion,” he said “and it is only
based on asking two students that
I met in the men’s room.” But

seriously,” he continued, “ I
don’t think English is the type. of-
course which should be taught in
a large class.”

He says that subjects like chem-.
istry, or physics, and other rela-
ted fields, could be taught in a
section big enough to fill up For-
bes Field, because in these cour-
ses there are no‘ nauances of
meaning; there are no moral ‘or
psychological ideas involved in
their teaching.

“If you have a course where the

student is intellectually involved .

Dr. Taube explains that many of the world's problems could be to
progress with a little humor.

Great Demographic Change

by BRUCE LEY
Staff News Writer

“Evolution will, starting now,
take place predominantly in ur-
ban areas,” announced Dr. M.
H. Crawford, primatologist of
the University. Dept. of Anthro-
pology, in his‘ lecture Jan. 22.
“This is the greatest demographic
change which man has ever un-
dergone.” ‘

Citing statistical studies, of the
Polish Hill district of Pittsburgh
and an Hassidic Jewish com-

munity in New York City, ‘Dr. .

Crawford described “genetic mic-
roevolution” and modern urban-
ization-induced disease as im-
portant ongoing agents in a
process of human natural selec-
tion:

He characterized evolution as
a series of biological “adapta-
and their “radiations.”
These adaptations, he related,
deal with man’s self-made diseas—'
es: “Leprosy, typhoid, and a vir-
us of the salivary gland have
evolved with man, and are spe-
” ‘Domestication of
animals led to “a new series of

pathogens, such as the small A

pox virus, and measles, from ‘dog
distemper.” I,

In Mendelian population
(those with inbreeding higher
than 50 per cent), such as the

,two cited, examination of blood

samples and radioactive isotopes
has disclosed that “certain eth-
nic enclaves” show “markedly
higher resistance to certain lead-
ing diseases.”

He pointed out that the “Jews,
who have lived for 4000 years
in crowded ghettos, are highly
resistant to tuberculosis” and ex-
plained this in terms of evolu-
tion: “Man has been in the city
4-5000 years — 200 generations.
We know that biological adapta-
tion is possible in this time.” He
‘attributed this knowledge to sig-
nificant studies of ‘Hemoglobin
S.’

Dr.lCrawford then deplored the
present problem of our pollution.

“Man has created a new kind
of filth .  (he) has created an

_ astonishing health problem for

himself: he is regularly ingest-
ing mixtures" of toxic gases; he is
drinking from a polluted water
supply,” and “he has created tox-

money order.
NAME...

ic drugs like thalidomide which
have tremendous effects on the
body.” He warned that “We
don’t know yet what effect even
aspirin will have.”

The most dramatic example
of this ‘new kind of filth’ was
taken from a Great Britain
study by Reid and Fairbarn,
which asserts that “chronic bron-
chitis is definietly linked with
air pollution,” and that, in Eng-
land, “chronic bronchitis is the
second highest cause of death in
men 40 to 55.” Dr. Crawford had
stated earlier that “tuberculosis
(also related definitely to air
pollution) is the single greatest
cause of death.” He added that
“lung cancer has ._been produced
in the laboratory by exposing
mice to smog and gasoline fumes”
and cited a case in which “genes,
even now, are deleteriously af-

3))

fected ‘in utera .

“Even now a nea'vy price in
mortality is exacted,”/Dr. Craw-
ford observed, concluding that

“Biological resistance against
air pollution may be a new genetic
adaptation, evolving at this
moment.”

with the teacher—-if you have a

course where the student can ask ‘

about the why’s of things, then
the student must be given time
to interact with the teacher, and
this can’t be done in a large class-
room situation,” Dr. Taube said.

Commenting on world situa-
tions, Taube pointed out that they
were precarious. “We have the
best of times and the worst of
times,” he reflected. “There are
wonderful opportunities for
possible changes in our times,
but there also is a possibility of
disaster.” He said the interna-

tional warfare must be elimina-.

ted. “If not,” he warned, “the ef-
fects will be horrible.”'

Dr. Taube includes sex in the
form of jokes and side remarks
when talking to his ‘classes. He
remarked that sex is inherent in
all of our behavior patterns. “Sex

is only called dirty or porno-.

graphic when it has no real mean-
1ng,” he commented. “In other

\ _words sex for sex’s sake, is the

cause of the general bad think-
ing about it,” he went on.

of humor, which is one of his

What’s Right?

‘Contributing Columnist

 f;L_ately there has been much talk about
fluoridation of all the water supplies in
estern Pennsylvania. A Channel 4 edi-
torial was one example of the support this
suggestion is getting. The propagandists
ill no doubt neglect to tell the public
some important facts about fluoride, so
here they are.
:'-Fluoride is a poison. The American
be,-ntal Association
once equated its toxici-

   

odified its stand, and
is;,now a staunch sup-
porter of the fluoride
“plan. The bad effects
bffluoride are not read-- A
ijly» observed, as it is a
‘cumulative poison. A
percentage of the
 iimical is constantly
‘being _stored up in the tissues and organs
* f;pe,ople who drink fluoridated water.

"fects of treated water on the body a long
rm study would have to made, but no
,_such study has ever been made. It has been
“.discovered,. however, that some children
nd-pregnantwomen cannot tolerate even
e one partper million dosage of fluoride

Mickey Mouse U?

Legionaires, this academic commun-
ity will prostitute its very ideals.

The Legion’s power has to be
fought.’ The University must make its
own decision regarding its curriculum
and institutional policies. The Univer-
sity must, at all costs, protect its- an-
tonomy. Every day, another group is
trying to unsurp this institution’s re-
sponsibilities.

Senator Fleming is infringing on
the ‘autonomy of the University
through his attempt to legalize state
rules and regulations concerning "Uni-
versity discipline. And now the Amer-
ican Legion is attempting to convince
the State Legislature to financially de-
stroy the University. 0

Its time for this Universityto stand
onits feet, and exert its influence. If
this academic community doesn’t fight
for its autonomy, the-Cathedral will
take on a new 1ook—a giant balloon of
‘Mickey Mouse will fly from the sum-
‘mitof our cherished gothic structure
symbolizing the quality of our aca-
demic convent. V

If we refuse to combat increasing

state influence, the decent folk will be
“proud of Pitt,” but the foundations of

this academic community will crum-

ble. .
The Pitt News can not stand idly

by in this struggle. We therefore ask

Dr. Posvar to make a public statement

‘that will insure his constituency that

the University of Pittsburgh stands
against the American Legion and the
Fleming proposals — two proposals
which threaten to destroy the function-
ing of the University.

We also ask the students to sign a ‘

petition protesting the Legion resolu-
tion. Let’s fight for the institution free-
dom of the University.

Daddy’s Drink

Here‘s an interesting sidelight on the

Most people think that Scott Baum won
the Student Government election. Most
people think that FARCE only received
around 70 votes. Well, the truth is that
FARCE received approximately 6,000 votes
and won a mighty victory.

HERE'S HOW WE ar— .
rived at this conclusion.
During the night of the
election, I was waiting
in the Pitt News office
for the final results. 1
The election commit-
tee’s first report on the
election gave the totals
for Baum, O'Neil, and
Bauman; however, the
‘FARCE total was not reported.

I went down to the Student Govern-
ment office and asked’ how many votes
FARCE received. The people down there
said, “Zero, we didn’t bother to count
them. FARCE ballots didn’t have a presi-
dent and vice-president writtenaon them,
so we just didn’t bother to count them.”

“You didn’t bother to count them?” I
was really shocked. But, as the “disquali-
fied presidential hopeful,” I should have
expectedthis kind of treatment from a Stu-
dent Government that feared FARCE so
much that iteven cancelled a meeting
which “had been designed to decide the
legitimacy of FARCE.

I returned _to The Pitt News office;
About three minutes later, another staff
member went down to the SG officeto
find out the FARCE total. They told her
that FARCE received around 70 votes.

in a special interview:

 

Today’s Quote

Dr. Myron Taube, Associate Professor of English,

out about FARCE was just another piece
of subversive propaganda attempting to
undermine FARCE’s power.

THE THREE MAJOR candidates re-
ceived about 2,400 votes. Since the elec-
tion committee didn’t bother to count our
votes, we of FARCE are assuming that the
other 6,000 undergraduates voted for us.
This gives us an overwhelming victory.

Some may say, why, those 6,000 people
didn’t vote at all. We say, so what? By
not voting, they voiced their apathetic
faith in FARCE even louder! What great-
er mandate could FARCE receive than an
overwhelming wave of unconcern! You
see, there are two types of FARCISTS.
There are the activist apathetics who go
out and proclaim their disinterest. Then
there are the apathetic apathetics, the
hard-core grass root non-carers, who don’t
even care enough to say they,don’t. If

.FARCE’s greatest appeal was to this lat-

ter category, can it not be proud? Can it
not say that is has reached the people and,
in the true apathetic spirit, offered them
nothing? ' '

THEREFORE, NO matter how the
votes are counted, FARCE is victorious.
We have shown that the election really
was a farce. The “winning” candidate got
1,200 votes—FARCEgot almost 6,000.

The obvious move for FARCE is to"set
up a government in exile. We were think-
ing about going to the Johnson campus,
but we were too apathetic to formulate
the plans. We’lll probably just stay here

' and do nothing in the true FARCE tradi-

tion.

“We must be able to laugh at ourselves. While it

is true that no one gets out of this world alive, the
least we can do is enjoy the trip.” I

fluoride question.

During WW II,_ ‘Hitler’s biochemists
discovered a tiny part of the brain which
was easily poisoned by fluoride. Oddly
enough -this section of the brain controls
the will to resist. Hitler and Stalin both
used fluoride to facilitate the pacificatio
of conquered peoples. ‘

The US Government via its US Pub-
lic Health Sevice has already brainwash-
ed 75 million Americans into accepting’
fluoridation. They seem to be in an awful
hurry to get the rest of us drinking the
stuff.

FLUORIDE, GOOD or bad, should
be of no concern to our_Federal Govern-'

' ment. Nothing-in the Constitution permits

the central government to do anything
with our drinking water. This is the type
of thing which the individual should have
maximum control over. Federal meddling
with our water supplies sets a dangerous
precedent. .

What will big brother want us to drink
next? Contraceptives or tranquilizers may-
be‘? Maybe someday the big planners will
decide to liquidate some segment of Amer-
ican society by putting lead in their wa-
ter. If you think your government. is in-
capable of such genocide,‘ you have been
asleep since at least the Bay of Pigs.

Save Aunt ,Mary’s ‘Pot’ I

T by MIMI LANDY
Special to The Pitt News

Pot should be legalized. Why? Why
not‘? It’s as harmless as anything else. Re-
cent scientific investigations have con-
cluded that overindulgence is artificial
sweeteners may result in chromosomal
damage. Rumor has it that earlyexposure
fingerpainting may cause irreversible psy-
chological damage and
may‘ lead to “other '
things.” \

LEGALIZING POT @
would not bring it under

could be brought at the 15
state marijuana store.
No one would have to
worry about taking a 1
bad? trip, because we

would buy only government inspected
prime-cut, grade A pot. If ‘it were legal-
ized, it could be taxed, and would serve as

-an excellent source of revenue. We would

have the money to wage a million wars,
but then—who would feel likefighting?

It wouldn’t be long before marijuana
became our national flower. The eagle
wouldn’t hold an olive branch in his hand

_ _anymore, and, of course, would be, de-
l picted flying.

The legalization of marijuana would
pose a few problems. It would put out of
work the pushers and the college students

who are working their way through col-

lege by the sale of it. The problems would
be outweighed by the many new jobs it‘
would create. Millions of people would be
employed as manufacturers, growers, and
pickers.

LEGALIZING POT wouldhave a great
effect on many other industries. The ad-
vertising industry, for instance, could. make
use of psychedelic lights and surrealistic
layouts. Slogans would take on ne,_vy,mean- _

.ings_. “Come up, come up, come all

way up, to the cool taste of
would chew their‘ little troubles away”;
‘.‘Put it in your washer and make it feel
like it’s ten feet tall.”

There would be innovationsin the food
industry. Chicken pot pie would never taste
the same again, and- Howard Hohnson’s
could add a new flavor to their list. ‘

The television industry would be faced
with severe competition. Viewers would
tune in without turning on. Or is it turn on
without tuning it? ..

Cigarette sales would increase, because
instead of cigarettes being menthola_ted,
they would be marijaunalated. At the same
time, this would minimize the cancer
threat, since one, would not need to smoke‘
so often. Cigarette vending machines would
have to be placed with care. They must be
kept out of the reach of legislators, be-
cause of the additional lethargic effect of
marijuana.

 MAKING POT LEGAL would keep
the_kids off the street and reunite the fam-
ily. No longer would dateless coeds set in
the dorms and cry on Saturday night. Who
would care? This would end the popula-
tion explosion. It would also end the need
for birth control Confuscious say: “Those
who fly together, seldom lie together.”

The day that marijuana -is made legal
will become a national holiday—the High
Holiday.vCatholics everywhere would go
to high mass. '

A certain ambiguity would arise, be-
cause college would become confused with
“high” school. High living and universi-
ty life would be one and the same.

JUST THINK, pot could be grown any-
where. Aunt Mary grew it in her window-
box among her African violets and philo-
dendrums. “They said it couldn’t be done,”
chirped Aunt Mary as the narcs took her
away in their cop car. Please, let’s legal-

ize marijuana so Aunt Mary can come _

Black—White Answers

Editor. The Pitt News:
To You Whom It Concerns

Since the Black Action Society‘s activi-
ties /on Martin Luther King Junior’s birth-
day, I've become fed up with some of the
insipid remarks I've heard and the letters
and articles I've read in The Pitt News.
Mine can be only one voice, but I hope it
opens a few minds and closes a few

mouths.

It appears that most people here at the

University are unaware that the demands
made by the BAS during the Computer Cen-
ter sit-in were made seven months ago.

Claims Editor ‘Campus Buffoon’

Editor, The Pitt News,

In his last days in office, Ken
Schueler has managed to come
up with a proposal of such malice
as to put his previous .accom-
plishments in the pale. The Facul-
ty Senate, it seems, must be ex-
panded to include among its mem-
bers — the Editor of The Pitt News!

Offhand, I can’t think of anyone
less suited’ to represent student
opinion than you, Mr. Stoller, al-
though, by the gurgling tone of the
editorial “Pass Proposals,” you
must consider yourself to be a
fount of infinite, benevolent wis-
dom. By what authority’ should
you be fobbed off as a represen-
tative of the students? Who elect-
ed you? Who nominated you? What
sensible man mentions your name
with anything but contempt?

It is typical of President Schue-
ler, sneaky to the end, that he
raised these proposals quickly,
ignoring the recent opportunity
to hold a refererﬁm along with
the election, to put any opposi-
tion at a grave disadvantage. We
are informed of the proposals
Wednesday. The Faculty Senate
acts Friday. Schueler’s banana-

. republic tactics win again, and as

student representative we have
our old friend, Schueler’s stooge,
Paul Stoller.

No doubt by the time this letter
is published, if it is published,
the decision will already have
been made and the student body
will either be impotently nash—

Foreign Students

Editor, The Pitt News:

It did not come to us asa sur-
prise that 35 per cent of the un-
dergraduate students participat-

ed in this year’s Student Govern- "

ment election.

We did not vote. Ask any for-
eign student his experience with
the Student Government, the story
is always the same — “Before you
go to their office get all facts
about your country in your head
or you will be embarrassed.”

, They ask:

_How long have you been in the
U.S.? Oh! Not long.

Then where did you learn Eng-
lish? (An insult).

How do you like the American
girls? (Surprised)

We know the answers you ex-
pect or at least you like to hear
and one begins to wonder who is
fooling the other. Let us talk
about the University of Pittsburgh
and NOT our various countries.
(President Scott Baum note) If
you are interested in a partic-
ular country. go to the Hillman
Library and‘ make your research.

How do you expect the foreign
student to answer a question
about the American girl whose
behavior is a culture shock to
him.

ing teeth, or celebrating their
deliverance. Nevertheless I say,
Paul Stoller should not be made
to,.represent the students, and
any student representatives
should be chosen by election, not
by decree.

Though I do not believe you,
Mr. Editor, to be -a proper rep-
resentative on the Faculty Sen-
ate, I do believe you would be per-
fectly suited for another post, and
if ever such an office as “Cam-
pus Buffoon” is created, you may
be assured of my wholehearted
support to attain a post which,
by merit, you deserved long ago."

Charles J. Schlotter
(Eng., ’71)

Director Doesn’t Understand. Issue

Editor, The Pitt News:

We are writing to express our
concern over the fact that a di-
rector of student publications at
the University of Pittsburgh, Mrs.
Esther Kitzes, should have so lim-
ited _an understanding of the
rights individuals have to express
themselves freely and as they
see fit.

Mrs. Kitzes, inher letter of Jan.

»23, 1969, to the editor of The

Pitt News betrays her inability to
discriminate between censor-
ship and expression; She seems to
equate the suppression of free
speech (Mr. Beers’ action with
regard to Alternatives) with
expression of one’s opinion (Al-
ternatives’ use of “objection-
able” words), and seems to re-
gard the action of Mr. Beers as
the quintessence of American in-
dividualism and freedom.

We leave it to the students of
Pitt to employ their sense of irony
in unraveling, such convoluted
logic. R ‘

With regard to the assertion by
Mrs. Kitzes that Mr. Beers did
not obstruct the University policy
of freedom of expression, we
must point out that anytime one
group must go through different
channels or maneuver through
more difficult obstacle courses
than another in, order to express
itself, what‘ one has, in effect,
is censorship plain and simple.

Mrs. Kitzes sees Mr. Beers as
a “man with a conscience who
refused to print material which
violates his sense of morality
and ethics.” But printers should
at least of all be censors; this
should be self-evident and part
of printing ethics.

Printers indeed have their
rights as citizens and should be
able to put their thoughts onto
paper and take them to a printer‘
with the same assurance as any
other citizen that what they have
written will be rendered true and
free of «censorship by someone
who finds objectionable what they
say orhow they have said it.

We regard the opinions of Mrs.
Kitzes, as expressed in her let-
ter, as an example of the failure

to understand what freedom of the‘ '

Groups are nothing but individuals.
Special favors for a group may be unearn-

Depose -Writer
Editor, The Pitt News:

Congratulations are in order
for Mrs. Ester’ Kitzes. Her well
received letter confirms in stu-
dents’ minds the continuous ava-
lanche of biased half truths (and
all too often complete falsehoods) ,
that have flowed from the articles
of Pitt News staff writer David
Rosenblum, ' . '

His articles have twisted the
truth about incidents whenever
possible, omitted important facts
when they would have clarified an
issue, and fabricated events
that either never occurred or _
were insignificant until blown out
of proportion ’ -

It has been our experience that
David Rosenblum has made little
or no effort to fulfill this respon-
sibility. We cannot see how the
Pitt News can conscientiously

permit such callous irreverence '

for the truth in newspaper report-
ing.

Therefore, we recommend that
David Rosenblum be removed as
a staff writer in the better inter-*
ests of the Pitt News and the stu-
dents who read it.

viewed the participants individually to gain an in-
sight into their differing views on such subjects as

sex, racial problems and student power.

Taking part in the show are Ruth Zaplain, sen-

ior writing major at the University and staff writer

, for the Pitt News and Virginia Joyce, junior poli--

-  tical science major who also writes for the Pitt
News as well as serving as newly elected LA

Senator.

 University Students

A local television station has attempted to pre-
sent a case for the generation gap between college
students and their parents with a cast of four
students and their parents. Three of them are stu-

Two male college students make up the rest
of the cast. They are Ludwick Hayden, graduate
student and assistant to the Dean of Students, and
Todd Simonds, last year’s editor of the Daily Prince-
tonian. Simonds is now a staff writer for the Guard-
ian, a racial weekly published in Greenwich Vil-
lage.

Two of the students hail from Pittsburgh, the
others are out—of-towners. Simonds and his family
originated in Ben Avon Heights; Miss Joyce is
from Swissvale. Hayden lived most of his life
in Baltimore; Miss Zaplin’s family comes from Bos-
ton. ‘

The taped show will be televised Friday night
from 9-9:30, on channel four.

trend reversed with the first

essentially regional. Harlem. for

ed over to a black entrepreneur,
who managed to fill them. The
ghetto seems to be fairly recent,
and not pre-determined by his-
tory.

Dr. Glazer believes that, al-
though the studies of the urban
historian will never have great
impact on sociological studies,
they may at least end the erron-
eous generalizations which are so
common.

By sauce L-Ev

Editor's Note: Antonio Cam-
pina, former budget controller’
for the Cuban Ministry of For-
eign Affairs (l959-l960), lectur-
ed a group of about 30 on “The
Structure, Conduct and Perfor-
mance of the Cuban Govern-
ment” (Under Castro) in l2l
CF on Jan. 15.

Mr. Campina first discussed
present methods of leaving Cuba.
He said that the primary means
of exodus at present is the “air—
lift” instituted three years ago by

 Lyndon Johnson as a challenge to
Castro. An alternative way out, he

continued, is to secure a visa
through Mexico or Spain, but
this, he pointed out, “is expensive
and difficult,” requiring “a guar-
antee of about $2000 from one’s
friends orvrelatives outside Cu-
ba.”

Campina proceeded then to de-
scribe what opportunities are
‘favailable:” “If you are 15 to 35
years of age, you can’t leave; the
militia needs you. You have been

‘drafted. If you apply to leave,
, you are an enemy of the govern-

ment, so you lose your ration card
and your telephone, if you have

' I one.- Then you must turn in your

(house) keys at the airport when

  f leaving, and you are strictly at the
V mercy of other people.”

The for-mer budget controller

  under Castro described living un-
,,der the Castro regime. “You have

no personal freedom. Batista last-

‘ :. '_ ‘, ed six years as a total dictator but

‘there were places for appeals —
Congress, Senate, Supreme Court.”

“We now have 75,000 political

 prisoners, and a total of almost

15,000 killed by, firing squads or
‘trying to escape.” he said. “In
Cuba today committees watch 3
or 4 blocks of houses. You must

:Campina Recalls Pre-Castro Cuba

requisition a permit from the Cu-

ban government to have a gather- '

ing of more than 4 or 5 people.
Nazis had a uniform, but who is
who in Cuba?”

Campina then compared pre-
sent-day Cuba with pre-Castro
Cuba. “Eighty percent of the

_ sugar cane industry was in the

hands of 75 or more Southern
planters — out of a population of
about 73,000. One of the big pro-
blems was with the so-called peas-
ant, who got laid off two or three
times a year.” Campina went on
to say that some of the mainly
agrarian problems of the Cuban

0 economy under Batista “were be-

ing alleviated by the complete re-

construction and overhaul of the

sugar cane factories” and by the
“production of a new kind of
lightweight furniture made of sug-
ar cane.” He pointed out that “in
8 or 9 years of Alliance for Prog-
ress, not a single other Latin
American country could duplicate
Cuban success” owing largely to
the establishment of a Bank
for Agricultural Development.

Nevertheless, Campina report-

ed that there had been some mark-
ed‘ unrest in the people, despite
the great strides that had been
made in the standard of living
as a result of the “true social re-
volution of 1933. A ‘Law of Per-
manency’ was established: after
6 months’ work or residence, you
were ‘permanent.’ Women gained

a right to 11/2-m0nth’s salaried ma-
ternity legve. Since "1930 there

was virtually no Conservative
Party; Cuba became one of the,
if not the, most advanced coun-
tries in the Southern Hemisphere,
even more than Mexico. There
was even a kind of social secur-
ity.

when the first Pitt Track Classic

sters will simply compete against
each other for personal honors,

“No, we won’t keep team
scores,” Banner explained. That
way the boys won’t have the pres-
sure on them.

“But, the competition will be
more keen ‘because there are

more teams, more runners,” he
added. -

Some of the trackmen entered
tomorrow bring "some excellent
credentials with them, too. The
two-mile race is the best exam-
ple of this, as two Al'l—American
c_ross country stars will be fight-
ing for the top spot.

Bowling Green’s Sid Sink and
West Virginia’s Carl Hatfield
are the great runners who should
make that chase one of the most
interesting of the day. Banner
will have Rudy Hufnagle compet-
ing against that awesome duo,
while Bob Burdleson of Ohio and
Ed Norris of Kent State hold hopes
of a dark-horse triumph.

Two other cross country All-
Americans will see action in the
Classic, both running in the mile.
Jerry Richey should be considered
the favorite in his duel with Kent’s
Ed Collidge in this race, but Rich-
ey has yet to reach his capacity

Banner admitted, however,
“I don’t know much about the

I’m sure.”

He is definitely sure that there

Ridl Hopes Cagers Can Box

Pistol Pete Maravi

BY JERRY L. GRUEBEL

Fresh from a stunning up-
set over West Virginia Tues-
day night, the cagers head
South this week-end for back—to-
back clashes with LSU and Tulane
tonight and tomorrow. _ 1

After tonight’s contest, which
will be broadcasted on WPGH be-
ginning at 9:00 p.m., the cagers
may be in no condition to do bat-

Needs Consistency ,

tle against the Green Wave in
New Orleans. Pistol Pete Mara-
vich,'a team all by himself,«al—
ways manages to wear out his op-
ponents. The 6’5” guard is the na-

. tion’s leading scorer with close to

50 points per. game.

“I don’t go for the philosophy
that we should let him score and
hold the rest of the team,” said
Ridl. “Tennessee tried to guard
him and they were pretty suc-

‘V cessful Monday night. We’re go-

ing to try to hold him also.”

Against Tennessee, the All-Am-
erican produced a season low of
21 points. Only two cagers, Mike
Caldwell (25 points against
WVU) and Rob McFarland (21)
have reached Pistol Pete’s “low.”

Nevertheless, Ridl plans to
make Pistol Pete work for his
shots. The cagers will play a num-
ber of defenses, most of ‘ them
based on a zone plus one man as-
signed to watch only the man with
the rubber arm.

“We’ll use a few boxes,” said
Ridl. “We’re going after him all
the time. Maybe he’ll score 60
points, but at least he’ll have to
earn them.”

Maravich handles the ball 80%
of the time, according to Du-
quesne’s scouting report on LSU.
So it’s a sure bet that LSU will
once again reach its scoring av-
erage of better than 87 points.
Cager success will depend. on
how well they can match has-

C

_ kets with Maravich and Company. ., —

“If we shoot like we did against
West Virginia,” rationalized Ridl,
“we can beat them. It’s only one
chance but it only takes one.”

The next night, the hoopsters
face another shoot and let shoot
team: Tulane, which averaged 86.6
points per game (14th in the na-
tion) last year, will beout for re-
venge of last year’s upset at the
Field House.

But added to the squad that
dropped the 75-73 battle against
the cagers are two big men who
have shot better than 50% this
season. Harold Sylvester, 6-6,
and John Sutter, 6-8, add plenty
of beef to the Green Wave attack
which is led by senior guard John-
ny Arthurs, a 24.3 points per
game performer.

‘~* Gymnasts Chance forWin

u\,
.‘

 

A: Kent State

By MIKE WALDHOLZ

In the beginning of the season coach Warren Neiger of the
gymnastics team expressed the feeling that they could beat
Kent State. Tonight the Panthers will try to make that prediction come

true, at Kent State.

Last year Kent State defeated the gymnasts by the score of 138-

105. At that time the Golden Flash-
es had two versatile_performers
in Phil Naukam and Brian Galla-
gher. Both of these boys will be
returning and are expected to per-
form well in as many as five or
six of the events.

But the gymnasts are hurting.
The seven man squad has been
reduced to six with the loss of
Bernie Jesiolowski, when he bad-
ly injured his left knee in last
week’s meet with Massachusetts.
In six events that’s spreading
the team very thin. Neiger ex-
plained his forced strategy, “Jim
Bilec will go in four events, tak-
ing over Bernie’s spot on the par-
allel bars. Phil Lilly will add the
long horse vault to his events and
we’ll go with only two scorers
in the floor exercise.”

Floor exercise had been the
gymnasts’ strongest event, as the
team had been consistently scor-
ing in the mid-20s. The loss of
Jesiolowski’s seven or‘ eight points

will be sorely missed in the event _

that the meet gets as close as
last week’s 112-111 victory over

1»--LWest Virginia.

W,

This brings up the ever pres-
ent problem that has and will be
faced by the gymnasts: their
very obvious lack of depth. “It’s
really not fair to the boys to have
a team so small,” Neiger related.
“One boy has an off night, one
gets an injury and our chances
for winning are minimized great-
ly.”

battling for the Tower B ‘lead with

Wednesday night’s first round
of action pitted Hawthorne House
against Keystone,_ in the lowest

scoring bout of the evening. Haw-'

thorne pulled it out 32-21
behind John Thissen’s 10 points,

despite a valiant effort by Key- .

stone’s Conlin. Meanwhile Play-
boys Penthouse was socking it
to Random House 78-42. Bob Sol-
onickne took scoring honors for
the victors with 18 big points.

The third game turned out to
be the most controversial. Strat-
ford House went most of the way
with four men (which is legal in
intramural competition) and won
the ballgame 35-27. After it was
all over there was some ‘discus-
sion’ over the matters but the ref-
erees settled it peacefully.

The second round of contests
saw Litchfield Manor breeze to
their second consecutive mas-
sacre, burying the four-man team
from Peanuts Gallery 56-39.

  

  
  

Ry’-

 
 

The seven performers have met
these challenges with great de-
sire. “They’re all team perform-
ers and work in events that some
of them shouldn’t go near,” ex-
plained Neiger. “Lowell Meek
should not be on the high bars, but
he’s there each week because
he’s needed.”

The outlook for next year seems
much brighter. With five strong
freshmen waiting in the wings
the team will be brought as high
as 13 performers. Neiger also
feels with some good recruiting,
especially in this area, that the
team could soon be, brought up
to 16 members, a figure the coach
feels is needed for a truly strong
season. ‘

Meanwhile the gymnasts strive
for improvement and bettering
their team as well as personal
scores. Hopefully victories will
come along with this.

In Teams First Away

By MARTIN HELLMAN

For the first time this season, the swimming team leaves
the friendly confines of Trees Pool. Tomorrow, the tankmen jour-
ney to College Park, Md., to take on the Terps of the University of Mary-

land.

This meet will be the first of three consecutive away contests for

the squad. The only remaining
home meet for the varsity will
be on Feb. 19. V

Maryland is one of the strong-
est teams that the mermen will
face this year. Coach Bill Grant
commented, “I don’t think that
they have lost a meet this year.
Their record is either 6-0 or 7-0.
I do know that they clobbered
Navy and American University.”

Against the teams’ only com-
mon opponent, West Virginia, the
Terps were victorious 64-30, while
Pitt \lost 61-43 to the Mountain-
eers.

Grant has one note of optimism,
however. “Against all _of their
opponents this season, they were
able to swim their freshmen. How-
ever, Maryland made an agree-
ment with us that they will not
use the frosh in our meet,” he
explained.

 Maryi

 

Grant’s problem of‘ the lack of
freestylers will again hurt the
squad tomorrow. “They have a
tremendous number of freestyl-

ers, whereas we will have to try *

and sneak.in our victories in the
backstroke, breastroke, butter-
fly and diving events.”

The brightest spot» on the team
has been diver Dave Wessel. In
the last three meets, he has bro-
ken records in the ‘one and three
meter dives.

“Dave is approaching the 300
point mark in the three meter
dive,” Grant remarked. “If he is
able to stay at this level of per-
formance, he will have a good shot

_ to be in the competition at Na-

tionals.” ’

The freshmen swimming team
continues to be impressive in
their performances. According
to coach Jerry Snyder, “The bovs

Confidence Boosts Larry Cuba

Into Contention for E cistern

By MARTHA HARTLE

Larry Cuba is experiencing his finest year as a varsity grap-
pler and the 130-pound senior attributes the bulk of his success
this season to a gain in self—confidence.

Co-captain Cuba has a 3-1 record in dual competition this season,
with his only loss coming in the opening meet with Michigan last term.
Since then he’s disposed of opponents from Navy, Temple and Clarion.

In the Clarion match he pinned
his opponent.

“The difference. this year is
mostly due to confidence in my-
self. It’s also due to the team
I’m wrestling with. The guys are
all confident and it’s contagious.
You feel bad if you’re not doing
your best,” he said.

“There’s a different bunch of
guys out there yelling at you from
the sidelines too,” he continued,
“and I have those guys to work
out with too.’ '

Cuba has‘ been wrestling con-
sistently at one weight class
since the semester break, as op-
posed to other seasons, and he
sees this as a definite factor
as well. “Last year I rotated be-
tween 137 and 145 and I got clob-
bered. Getting down to 130 has
helped me.”

In the Michigan loss,‘ Cuba
wrestled at 137; he’s undefeated
thus far at 130.

The biggest individual match
for Larry‘this year and through-
out his varsity career was the
Navy contest. In that match, Cuba
upset highly rated Navy captain
Steve Comiskey quite handily.
The situation was quite a reversal
from Larry’s previous two en-

  

counters with Comiskey. “We

. drew last year,” he commented,

“and he pinned me in my sopho-
more season.

“Comiskey and I are pretty
close skill-wise and physically,
but I guess I was psyched and he
wasn’t,” he continued.

Cuba rates Comiskey and Le-
heigh’s Pete Henning as two of the
top 130-pounders in the East. With
a win over Comiskey behind him,
Cuba is hoping to place in the
Eastern tournament. “I’d like to
get a shot at the nationals, too,”
he continued. “You have to place

first _or second in the Easterns

to qualify for that.”

Cuba, along with the rest of ~

the matmen, have changed their
style of wrestling this season as
well. “The -biggest change has
been a switch over to the mid-
Western style of stance and take-
down. The new stance affords
the wrestler a better defense and
a good basic offense,” he explain-
ed.

As far as the rest of the dual
meet season goes, Cuba says he’ll
do okay if he gets by his oppon-
ent from Maryland Tuesday night.
“The Maryland guy has already
beaten Henning,” explained Cuba.

  
 

‘SENIOR GRAPPLER Larry Cuba,'_shownAhere in action a g a i n s t Temple's Dave Thorpe, has picked up three" irn.

S pressive wins since moving down to I30-pound weight class at the beginning of the term. A swing man last
year, Cuba has now become one of coach Dave Adams’ consistent performers and is a contender for Eastern hon-

OIS.

 

itle 

LARRY CUBA
Gains Confidence

“As far as going undefeated the
rest of the way, it’s hard to say.
One night you’re psyched, another
you’re not.”

Cuba also feels the Maryland

match will be the toughest for the
team as a whole this season.
