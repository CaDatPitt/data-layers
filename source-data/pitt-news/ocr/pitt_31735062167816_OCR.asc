Organization Provides  

Info   On Repression

by ANNE DORN
Staff Writer

A man named Edgar C. Bundy.
head of the Church League of
America. made a story. in a news-
paper when it was announced that
SDS had been stepping up their ac-
tivities to bring its philosophies
to workers this summer. Bundy
stated that he would have to ex-
pand his already numerous files
on groups such as left wing organ-
izations. The policeiknowabout his
secret files, ammo nothing about
it. Bundy has unlimited funds. and
has already paid more than $1.-
000 to find out information about
various people. How he obtains
the majority of his information on
personal facts is unknown. People

‘ don’t know when they are placed
into Bundy's file.

This story is only one of several
that was told to The Pitt News by
Russ Trunzo, founder of the Re-
pression Information Service
Committee (RISC). The several
stories are only a few of many ex-
amples of personal and political
repression that Trunzo has accu-
mulated and researched over the
last few years.

Trunzo defines his organization
as “multi-tendencied." that is.
there is room for persons of ev-
ery political leaning to involve

themselves. The prime purpose-

of the new committee is to service
anyone who desires information
that cannot be obtained through
normal channels. “Eventually we
want to develop our own news
stories." stated Trunzo. "We
would like to be able to supply in-
formation on request. set up com-
munications with movement or-
ganizations across the country.
and send out a newsletter."

Members of the University faculty, staff and student body
have been invited to nominate possible candidates for honorary -
degrees to be conferred at the 1970 Commencement on April

In a statement, Jack E. Freeman, director of the University
Secretariat, explained that a nominee should be a person who has
achieved distinction in a field requiring a high degree of intellec-
tual attainment. Candidates are desired from a variety of fields
representing the broad range of the University’s activities. He
said that preference will be given to candidates whose special
field of competence or accomplishment correlates to a specific
mission or interest of the University.

- “Nominations should include a brief statement in support
of the nominee, together with a curriculum vita and other docu-
mentation that may be useful in evaluating the nom1nee’s candi-

Freeman said that the nominations will be reviewed by an
ad hoc committee composed of the Chancellor, the Provost, the
Acting Vice Chancellor for the Health Professions, the President,
Vice-President and Secretary of the University Senate, and two
students representing the graduating class, pursuant to the rec-
ommendation of the University Senate Committee on Organiza-
tion and Procedures. “The ad hoc committee will recommend
candidates for honorary degrees to the Board of Trustees for fin-
al approval in accordance with the University By-Laws,” he

He reported that nominations should be mailed not later than
Jan. 23 to Jack E. Freeman, director of the University Secretari-
at, Room 106 CL, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

RISC is now operating in four
cities: Pittsburgh, Chicago, New
York, and San Francisco. A na-
tive of Pittsburgh, Trunzo worked
as a newsman with many contacts
in Chicago before returning here
to start up his program. He claim-
ed that in several other cities,

’ “People can’t internalize the con-

ditions of repression,” andithat
they can’t believe repression ac-
tually does occur “here in Amer-
ica.” But Pittsburgh, noted Trun-
zo, “is a place to reach people,
where people are willing to d

work.” ’

Besides commenting on hazy
facts in such cases as the assas-
sinations of President Kennedy
and Malcolm X. and the Black
Panther shoot out in Cleveland.
Trunzo cited less well-known
cases for example of ‘repression
In one case.’ "a black militant in
Arkansas was attacked and beat-
en by a mob of white folks and_he
was convicted fordisorderly con-
duct."

Trunzo will speak at one of the
workshops at the Saturday Mora-
torium. Anyone desiring more in-

Cundra, Fabricant, Miller

Criticize Present SC

by EVAN PATTAK
Staff Writer

Steve Cundra. Michael Fabri-
cant. and Harris Miller. the three
announced candidates for presi-
dent of Student Government (SG).
all agree that the current struc-
ture of SG is non—representative.
that its leaders are moribund. and
that its Senate is legislatively im-
potent. Their proposed solutions.
however. differ dramatically. and
therein‘ lies the dynamic of the
1970 SG campaign.

Speaking before about 100 peo-
ple in the lobby of Tower C Wed-
nesday evening. the presidential
aspirants outlined their platforms
in an informal debate. Each can-
didate spoke for ten ‘minutes. and
each was permitted five minutes
for rebuttal. A spirited question
and answer session concluded the
forum. ’

Miller. beginning the debate.
noted that the SG Senate deals
with little of importance. not be-
cause of the body's incompetence.
but because of the Senate's lack
of power.

“The real power of this Univer-
sity,” charged the head of the Stu-
dent Community Union (SCU),
“lies with the administration and
the faculty.” I I

  CAS Institutes

Variety of Courses I

tion of Dr. Joseph Hinchliffe.

trial Complex" with Dr. Arnold
Miller of the Political Science
Department.

Professor John Beverley of the
Spanish Department teaches CAS

ern European Literary Criticism."

Steve Rosen is the faculty spon-
sor for the CAS 4, “Comparative
Study of Student Protests within
the University.” Student sponsors
are Diane Ulyon, Carl Van Horne,

and Tony Harrigan.

Offered in thefall will be CAS 5.
"Technology and Social Change‘?

is the faculty sponsor. and Dave
Arbeitman and_ Kevin Schulberg
are the student sponsors.

CAS 7 is “The Power of Non-'
Violence.” Faculty sponsors are
John Townsend and John Chasen.
Dave Spirtes and Julie Gruendler
are the student sponsors.

CAS 8 will be offered in the fall
in conjunction with the Black Ac-
tion Society. "It Is Nigerian

In the fall. there will be CAS 9.
a course on drugs in conjunction
with the.School of Pharmacy.

In addition to the CAS courses,
there is an interdisciplinary
course in the History Department,
History 188, funded by the col-
lege. The title of the course is
“The Historical and Social Role
.-and it inizswlxss sociol-
Tliterature and history. I

 

Miller. who was accompanied
by his vice-presidential candidate
Shep Goldberg. pointed to the thaw
in student relations with the
administration and the faculty as
proof that this is where political
decisions must be effected. Hop-
ing to continue along this path. the
sophomore candidate proposed
the abolition of the SG Senate.

In lieu of this allegedly archaic
institution. Miller would work
through the 12 standing com-
mittees of the University Senate.
where students currently sit with-
out voting rights. With vigorous
recruitment. Miller wishes to see
students elected to committees in
which they are most interested
and most qualified.

The chairman of the Committee
on Student Organizations and SG
Senator declined to make “pie in
the sky’ promises” and promised
that a Constitution detailing his
plans would be circulated today.

Mike Fabricant. nominee of the
March for Action Party. also ar-
gued that SG is structurally de-
fective and that the SG Senate is
an anachronism from an earlier
era. Basic disagreements with
Miller's remedies caused the
chairman of the Liberal Arts Cab-
inet to seek the presidency him-
self.

Fabricant does not believe that
a Senate. once in office. would
abolishritself. Suspicious of cam-
paign promises, he reasoned that
the only way to insure the mass
resignation of the Senate is to
elect Senators who are seniors.

' “Our entire slate is made up of
seniors,” declared Fabricant.
“When they graduate at the endiof
the term, the Senate will have to
go with them.”

To replace the current SG set-
up. Fabricant called for a Univer-
sity-wide conference to discuss
the exact manner of restructur-
ing. This caucus would conceiv-
ably be as broad-based as the Uni-
versity iteself.

The Faculty of Arts and Sci-

vocation for the University.

The convocation will be open to

system in grade schools will be
discussed.

Fabricant and his seniors, mav
run into" a legal snare, in that sec- ’

ready envisioned the problem and’ -

confided, “If all of the problems

haven't been taken care of by the I

end of the term, then we'll simply

have to come back for another p

term.”

Unlike his opponents, Steve
Cundra sees nothing wrong with
the structure of SG.

“The structure is effective.”

chided_the junior hopeful. “It.-is
the people who were -wrong."

Cundra linked his opponents

. with the Scott Baum administra-
tion and angrily scored them for.

their laxity. Leveling his accus-»

ing finger at unchaired commit-,

tees and floating allocations, the
leader ‘of the “United Student

Coalition” branded as “poets and:

philosophers” those who would
renovate SG without providing
capable leadership., \»

New Pros

Educational Opportunities Sought

by POHLA SMITH
Staff Writer

One hundred and fifty members
of the New Porfessional Associa-
tion of Allegheny County. a group
of "non—professional“ workers in
education. welfare. and social
fields. marched on the office of
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar De-
cember l6. 1969. to demand that
the University give them educa-
tional opportunities to help them
advance into new "professional“
careers.

The group stated they are often
denied advancement in jobs they
are already doing because they do
not have educational qualifica-
tions. Some of their demands were
the chance to continue their ed-
ucation with scholarship aid. spe-
cially designed curriculums. cred-
it for experience. etc.

According to leaders of the as-
sociation, the University has re-
sponded to its demands by setting
up a new program that is fast
gaining attention in several other
universities across the nation.
Called the New Careers Program,
they say it is specially designed
to help intelligent people, who
lack the financial means, improve
themselves to the fullest extent.

The program is under the co-
ordination of Dr. Edward J.
Barnes. director. and Norman R.
Dickson. associate director. both
of University Community Educa-
tion Program (UCEP). Dickson
reported that new careers. just
initiated last week currently con-
sists of 90 students who are di-
vided into three categories. Cate-
gory one consists of 30 students
who are just beginning their col-
lege training. Category two is
made up of people who already
have some college credits. The
people in category three have al-
ready completed around 80 credit
hours.

Clothing rot the Naked my

-'NOWfAlIlNinter raggs 1/; -- ‘/30ff.

According to Dickson there are
some special features to New Ca-
reers that make it especially val-
uable. One of the most important
is the creation of special sections
of regular ['niversity courses
which are especially designed to
the students‘ needs. There are of-
fered in sociology 81. psychology
80. elementary education 117.
foundations of education. educa-
tional psychology 96. and second
term English. These sections will
be very small. a maximum of 20.
to insure individual attention.

It was also brought out that
other features included special
counseling. and limited credit for
life work experience. UCEP has
also been granted two new staff
members to tutor in mathematics
and English.

UCEP officials explained that
students gained admittance to the
program by first being screened
by a committee composed of
members of New Pros and theirs

was the final decision. Students
in the program are granted tui-
tion scholarships according to
needs by analysis of a confidential
statement.

New Careers is designed to con-
serve human talent. In the words
of Dr. Dickson. “It's a waste in a
democracy to have people with
talent and restricted opportunity
touse it.“

Mrs. Reeble Nlarshall. presi-
dent of the New Pros. said though
New Careers does not meet all
the needs of the organization. it
is a good step in the right direc-
tion.

The program will be accumu-
lative. therefore. permitting more
and more people to become in-
volved each term.

Among the editorials on the
itorial page of Wednesday's
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was a
rather questionable support of a
statement made earlier this week
Secretary of Defense Melvin
Laird. -

-="L*aird’,s statement that the
iron Administration would pro-
page this year a gradual reduc-
tion in both student and occupa-
tional deferments was somehow
considered “welcome news“

It‘s easy to envision poor peo-
ple pulling themselves up b_v

their bootstraps unless you know.

the problems they face. Sure.
you faced problems too. Your
parents were poor immigrants who

If Mr. Nixon really wishes to
move in_ such a direction that
all young .?men will be treated
equally and fairly. he will put
an end to compulsory military
service. It seems. however. that
Mr. Laird and his Eternal God
define equality in the terms of
the Administration.

If the deferments "reform"
proposal is accepted. then the
young men of this country will
be treated equallylby the people
above them. That is in no way
fair.

students he had hoped to induce.
They won't. be there. won't care
who is.

Fabricant has overestimated
the urge for self-government at
the University. Students will
not be bothered with political
/involvement of the scope that

‘Fabricant suggests. The candi-

dates will threaten, beg, whee-
die, and cajole, and not more than
30% of the student body will find
their performances interesting

enough to vote for one of them

Here, politics is like an iceberg-
if you show the students a shiny
white peak, they will let you do
what you will with the submerged

territory, forget even that it

Students want a President

thirty years. richer than any
single nation in the history of
thelworld._‘Hiding in the folds
and dark corners of American
economics are the "ghetto mak-
ers". the people who twist this
wonderful system of ours to work
in their own behalf‘ at others‘
expense.

One of the dirty angles of
real" estate in this process is
something called ‘contract buy-
ing. Remember. if you will. the
neighborhood -where you might
have lived before you came to
suburbia. Not a slum. by any
means. but a pleasant street with
old building. Then. on one such
street. the rumor was spread that
blacks were moving in. Perhaps
a black family was planted on
the street by «-a greedy man with
some capital to invest. "This
neighborhood is becoming a
slum.';‘ he told your landlord.’
among others. "You‘d better sell
now while you can." '

If the rumor is spread well

enough. interested people can
purchase . two-and three-flat
buildings from scared owners

a sometimes half their true val-
ue. And. up until about a year
ago. poor people. -especially
blacks were unable to get even
an FHA loanito make such a
purchase. Their credit was not
good. ' ‘

B lack   Nationalists

So the buildings-— were bought
by the crooks with the capital.
who in ‘turn were perfectly will-
ing to extend credit to poor
blacks. to whom they would sell
a $22000 house they purchased
for $12000 for upwards of $30.-
000. Their mortgate. or "con-
tract".as they called it. would
be f'or twenty years at six per-
cent interest compounded m_onth-
ly. That means a monthly mort-
gate payment of $275.00. $150.00
of which is interest.

Insurance rates in such areas
go sky-high for some reason.
But the poor man who has just
bought a house from a contract
owner can also insure his house
through the same man. The
technique is similar; the con-
tractor will buy a large number
of policies at a wholesale price.
and sell them to the new home-
owner at a good healthy profit.
And then. frequently. he‘ll let
the policies he purchased lapse.

Depressing. isn’t it? That’s
the typical story of a black fam-

ily who tries to improve itself‘

by moving into anew home in

a new neighborhood. Needless I

to say, there'.s.not much money
left in a family’s" budget to im-
prove these big old houses
which were left to ruin by flee-
ing landlords. So a new slum is
born.

Panthers °Elirlniinated’

by RUSS TRUNZO
Special to the Pitt News

Since the rise of Malcolm X
to worldwide prominence. the
government of this country has
been very wary of B1ackANation-
alistsgof any sort. and have ob-
J‘ their progress closely.-
Whenever a Black Nationalist
“leader begins td be too militant
and too successful. they make .a,
point of eliminating him.

Although “The Autobiography
of Malcolm X” has sold very
well.~when Malcolm was ass-
assinated by agents of this gov-
ernment and the crime was
blamed on the Black Muslims.
most of the middle class Negroes
and white libs breathed a collec-
tive sigh of relief.

This same ‘ attitude has pre-
vailed in the case of Ahmed
Evans. from Cleveland. Ohio.
Most libs and Negroes believe
the report they read in the news-
paper that said Ahmed is a mad
killer who was responsible for
the deaths of eight cops in Cleve-
land.

They‘re so used to reading
these stories that they never

— checked. into the facts to learn

that the so-called "Shoot-out"
was in fact a case of Ahmed‘s
group defending itself against
an attack launched by the Cle-
veland police. timed to occur
when Mayor Stokes was out of
the city. in an effort to eliminate
Ahmed completely.

Ahmed Evans was such a mad-
dog dangerous killer that a month
before the "shoot-out" the “Cle-
veland:Now" project had given
him $10.000 to help in his work
with young people in the Hough
area.

The facts of the case were
never presented in court. and as
a result Ahmed Evans is now
living under a death sentence.

.  many 

Another case. less known than
Ahmed.’s case. is the case of
Martin Sostre. in Buffalo. Martin
Sostre was convicted entirely on
the testimony of government em-
ployees‘ or, paid police informants
—no private. citizen stepped forth
to testify against Martin. '

He was held under $50.000
bail (‘the charge was "sale ‘of
narcotics) despite the fact that

" he was acting lass-his own attor-

ney and be repeatedly asked to
be released on ball so that he

on orders from the judge. Mar-
tin was tied to“””his chair and
gagged,

The gag was removed only to
allow Martin ‘to reply to speci-
fic questions. It‘s tough on the
objectivity of the jury to see the

defendant trussed up before
them. No outcries from Arthur
Goldberg on that one.

So the forces of Repression
have had a history of these
cases and a score of instances
where they've, mishandled mem-
bers of the Black Panther Par-
ty. or have raided and vandalized
Panther Party offices with im-
munity.

No one calling for blue-rib-
bon commissions to investigate:
why shouldn't they think they
can continue. to get away with
it? There‘s enough material
available now — finally —— on the
Black Panther Party that there‘s
no need here to go into detail,
on their situation.

During the past month. La Cosa

educational revolution at the Uni-

the Political Science Department.
intending to sell its members pro-

quality teaching. no over-crowded‘
classrooms. and courses relevant
to today's dynamic world, Such
safety will come only at the ex-
pense of a possible redistribution
of each faculty members time.

They are being demanded to de- ~

vote more time to preparing lec-
tures. designing courses. and just

While this association is no
way affiliated with an internation-
al crime syndicate. it hopes to
protect political science students
from being robbed of a real edu-

cation. Membership in the group .

will be made open to all students
majoring in or in any way inter-
ested in political science. The
club has no dues. officers. or
other bureaucracy. However. cer-

’1“7"tain students have already initi-

ated programs designed to pro-
mote better teaching and estab-
lish more discussion “among po-
litical science majors. and their
professors.

Dr. Morris Ogul has agreed to
speak at the club’s first meeting
to be held Tuesday, Jan. 20, at 4
p.m. inI50l SU. He will discuss
“President Nixon and Public Opin-
ion” in evaluating Nixon’s first
year in office and in forecasting
what his policies will mean to the

 American public.

Hoping to improve the present
offerings of the Political Science

preparing a student evalu‘at‘i‘on

the professor may be unaware.

Through such dialoge. many stu-

  After dropping a 77-69 decision to the Little Mountain-
 eers of West Virginia, the Cubs, not unlike the varsity Pan-
 thers, must feel like the little boy who walks all theway to

the grocery store for his mother and (having forgotten his

goal) comes back empty-handed.

The Cubs had kept their goal in mind for 36 of the contests to-

tal 40 -minutes. but in the final

 four minutes they were led a-

stray. Gary Reichenbecher toss-
ed in a hook‘ shot to bring WVU
within breathing distance at

A 63-62. Seconds later (3:38). Larry

Harris, who led all scorers with
29 tallies. swished a jump shot
which nudged the Mounties into

Within the next minute of
action. the 6-8. 235 lb. Reichen-

_ becher scored one basket and

five free throws. At that stage.

In the beginning moments,
it appeared that the Cubs might-
’ve achieved their goal with a
roar. They led’5-1 in the game’s
first three minutes and increased
the lead to 11 points at the
half, 44-33.

WVU frosh coach Chuck Win-
sor remarked that "it was a
tough one for him (Cub coach
Grgurich). It's hard for a coach
who works as hardashe does to
accept a loss like this."

connected for 14. Dick Symonds
scored 13. and Skip Kintz tallied
10.

The Panther shooting percen-
tage was 46.4, as the Cats con-
tinued to move that mark up to
respectability. “

The percentage was built up on”

a string of successful shots early
in the game. The Panthers built
up a 12-1 lead when their spree
was accompanied by a WVU
drought that resulted in the Moun-
taineers‘ being shut-out from the
field for nearly eight minutes.
Shortly before that first two-point-
er Moran asked for a timeout.

“They changed their defense
then." Ridl noted. “Theywent to
a man—to-man. But I knew they
were due to start hitting. I've seen
it happen many times. We were
hitting everything and they could-
n’t get a basket."

The Mountaineers slowly cut the
Panther lead until they finally
tied the score at 42-42 when Hum-
mel swished from about 15 feet
with 13:10 remaining. The score
was knotted and changed hands
several times before Woods’ tap
decided the outcome.

  Struggling Lions Here

by MARTHA HARTLE '
Sports Editor

Panther cagers haven’t beat-
en Penn State since 1964, but

tomorrow night at the Field
House, Buzz Ridl’s squad would
like nothing better than to end
that pattern.

Penn State is currently strugg-
ling through one of its worst sea-
sons in recent years, posting a
4-5 mark which does not include
last night’s encounter with Tem-
ple.

Princeton handed the Nittnay
Lions their latest defeat and it’s
one that has gone down in the
Penn State record books. Penn
State scored a mere 38 points

In the following ten minutes,
however. the Cubs were knocked
into a daze and soundly out-
scored’ 24-5. During the 24
point blast, Levi Phillips 62"
and Larry Harris 66" contri-
buted a 16 point total output.
Also. both players had 16 game
rebounds.

WVU coach Winsor pointed

out the reasons for the first and ‘

second half differences.

“We were sort of operating
with four cylinders instead of
five throughout the\first half.
Phillips hasn‘t played yet this
season and didn‘t know our of-
fense that well. He came around
in second half. though.“

Other pertinent factors. were

CLEVELAND EDWARDS had his best scoring night as a Panther inthe heart-
breaking 67-66 loss to arch-rival West Virginia. The 5’lO” guard, who
is known for his ball-handling and assists, dumped in 16 points.

in losing to the nationallyirank-
ed Tigers 77-38 and the point

total is the lowest for a Lion,

Squad since 1958 when the team
scored a mere 31 points against
‘Syracuse.

Included among the Penn State
victims are Kent State, Boston
College Seton Hall and Rochest-
er (in the Kodak Classic over
the holidays.) Johnny Bach’s
team has dropped contests with
Syracuse, Columbia, Stanford,
Duke and Princeton.

Closing Moments;

“By getting more aggressive
on defense in the game’s last
ten minutes, we suddenly became
more aggressive on offense. We
were getting better shots and
forcing Pitt to shoot bad shots,”
stated Winsor.

The two Cubs that even the
WVU coach couldn’t ignore in
his appraisal of the contest
were Buzzy Harrison and Carl
Morris. Harrison accounted for
24 points and numerous steals
and deflections; Morris tossed
in 16 points before he fouled
out with nine minutes remain-
ing. In addition, he fought like
a fiery animal under the boards.

Defense and speed have been

of an offensive punch. Rebound-

at Temple.

the defending Eastern Cham-

The three freshmen wrestling
in the light weights were not
permitted to wrestle in the Navy

rule and their absence severe-

Temple, who finished second
in last year’s Middle Atlantic
Conference, sixth in the Easterns,
and tenth in the N.C.A.A. Cham-
pionships boasts its toughest men
in the light weights, according to
Adams.

Two out of three of Temple’s

top wrestlers will return in. this
season’s attempt to improve on
last year’s 7-2-1 record.

The most promising veterans

are Marc Beretz, a senior and

Junior Walt Strosser.

Both men captured Middle
Atlantic Conference champion-
ships last year and Strosser cap-
tured an Eastern title.

them,” _he explained. “They al-
ways recruit real well and it’s
hard to judge how strong‘they
will be. I look for a tough meet.”

One area in which Banner ex-
pects strength from Kent State is

the sprints. They are also strong,

in field events. And if a distance

runner named Norris is healthy.

the Ohioans could provide tough

opposition in ‘the mile and two
0 mile as well.

Banner’s thinclads will natural-
lly rely on the strength of re-
corder holders Jerry Richey.
Br ant Salter. Smitty Brown. and

Temple’s biggest loss through
graduation is N.C.A.A. champion
Wayne Boyd. Boyd ‘won the
M.A.C. title and the Eastern
Championships competing in the
123 pound class. He was the first
Temple wrestler to capture" an
N.C.A.A. title so he will be miss-
ed on the Owl Squad. «

Temple’s Coach Bob McCreary
has been working on his under-
classmen with whom he expects
to fill out his starting line-up.

SCOTT ROSS

the mile and two-mile relay team.
But a host of freshmen and soph-
omores add depth and balance
this year.

One area which has been
strengthened is the pole vault,
where two freshmen will get
their first shot at the Field House
record. Doug and Sam Prentiss
are the vaulters and i
has already cleared 14’3”, the
current varsity record.

Newcomers John Simpson and
Steve Hein. both sophomores:
will compete in the shot put.
while Salter. Don Porotto and
Frank Smith will enter the broad
jump. Smith is a freshman. while
Porotto is a sophomore.

Joining Salter in the high jump
will be sophomore John Wilborn.
In last year’s Kent State meet.
Salter set a new high jump mark

Coach Adams ‘expects the
roughest competition in the light
weights with returning letter-
men, Tim Fiore and Frank Spa-
cek, and sophomore John Reive.

Coach Adams will send his top
three freshmen. Steve Weiss.
Randy Payne, and Scott Ross
against their Philly foes in the
light weights.

The Owls also have tough men

in the 1-77. 191;. and heavy

weights classes.

Adams believes the opening

the moving force behind their
continued victories.

Adams also feels that the team
has great potential. “If they

of wrestling, they can win,” he
affirmed.

The coach admitted that his
