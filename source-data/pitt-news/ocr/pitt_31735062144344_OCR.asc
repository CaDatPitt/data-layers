for the duration of the war bi ‘a dis‘-
cussion on war and a-thletircs. Mr.
Rose is head .0-f_P,itt’s Athletic Council
an-d has. been -prominent in the direc-
tion *Pi‘ttTs athletic -destiny for a
nurn-ber of years. He says:
2 i The -demand for athletes and coaches
for the «supervision of games and
physical development -in soldier camps
abroad and the insufficient number
likewise for the Army camps at home
seems to answer co~nclusi've1y’ whether
or not the colleges should continue to
engage and en-courage :as ‘far as pos-
sible all Jmaj-or sports. , , ,

The fact that great inroaiis ‘have’
been made by the war on bothiarhai-R
gteur and iyprofessizonal ii_a.nk§~._is proof‘
that athletes -are -a class of men the
couintryneedst The number of sf-ormer
college sta:rs that are now enlisted
as '_commis~si.on-ed ofﬁicers lsuggests in
the_« strongest terms "that colleges’
everywhere in‘ this country: should en-
‘courag-e , an-cl rrfaintain 'corn_.pe'titive

Furthermore the government is see-
ing the advantage of sports from the
beneﬁcial effect they Ihave on the
mcinds-,~of the -boys in -camp life and_-the
troops behind the ﬁgihrting lines; so
thedisposition of some educational
ll1S‘l2ltl.1lCi0l1S _‘lO discontinue athletic,
activities is not in keeping with the
recommendation. of igo'vern'ment au-
thoritties, and we-shoul-d realize the
imperativenecessity, of maintaining
abundant ‘int,et'est' in all brandhes of
sports for the beneﬁt of those who are
still at home. ‘  ’

VV e should, alvll means not lose
sight '.o7f.ith'e'.seriou_sness of the‘great

conﬂict that is now going on,‘ and war.

activities are absolutely neceesrsiary and
every one should do -his or ‘her part
to-aid‘ in bringing the war to ~21 suc-
cess?ful_conclusion,.»but. this can be
done without .a'b*andonir'1‘g7§ports ,as en-
gaged in before the war;

In France, vvhere our soldiers are
in training p»r.e~pa1‘at-o.ry'to‘ ‘going to
the front, something is needed to keep]
up the spirits and break the rnonotony
of the intensive training the «boys are
experiencing.

Reportsgfrom» Y." M. C. A. head-

who are in‘ the camps say that sports
iare'an absiolute necessity.‘ ' .
The same argument‘ will hold good
at home among the industrial plants.
"There will be ‘a greater; —n»-umtbe-r of
youths in college coming forward,

i From  college, =st.an‘d'poin-t} the real
test -of successful ‘prom,otior_1'.n.owl is

not how many spectators" are drawn ,

to witness ‘a game or- competition, but
how many young men taking -pant in

so doing. ' 2
