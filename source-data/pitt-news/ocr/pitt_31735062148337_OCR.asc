Giving

Plan to Increase

Alumni Body’s Revenue

Failure of University to Grant Year’s Subsidy
Forces Group to Institute Campaign for Funds

In order to increase revenue for the current year, the University
Alumni Association has reinstalled the alumni giving plan, Eugene
Burkhart, alumni secretary, announced today.

“This move was made necessary‘

by the failure of the University to
grant the alumni group the usual
subsidy, which last year amounted
t'o $10,000,” Burkhart explained.
He pointed out that dues income
at $3 a member was insufﬁcient to
keep the organization-—almost
3000 paid-up members-running
throughout the current ﬁscal year,
which ends June, 1940.

Plan Raised $23,000

The giving plan was ﬁrst used in
1923-24 when the association raised
over $23,000 of which $14,000 was
presented to the University. Roy C.
McKenna, ’O3, chairman of the 1923
drive, will again head the present
campaign.
the Vanadium Alloys and Colonial
Steel companies, is a trustee of the
University.

Pledges totaling $2,000 have al-
ready been made by 43 alumni, an
average of $46 extra per member-
ship.

Normally the University grants the
alumni appropriation in August. This
year, however, administration ofﬁcials
indicated that the grant would be
delayed; to date no statement assur-
ing the grant has been made by either
the Board of Trustees or the admin-
istration.

“The administration has given no
reason why the subsidy was suddenly;
dropped,” Mr. Burkhart maintained,
“although the Chancellor has period-
ically launched attacks upon ‘a small
group of alumni’ whom he charged
with retarding the growth and suc-
cess of the University.”

Curtailed Program .

John B. Nicklas, alumni president,
has maintained that, “only by dras-
tically curtailing its activities can the
organization continue through the
year without ﬁnancial aid from its
membership. The pledges of $2,000
already made will enable the associa-
tion to operate the remainder of the
year with a curtailed program.”

The association announced two
weeks ago that its proposed $10,000»
budget would result in an expected
$1,380 deﬁcit.

Resumption of the giving plan is
thought by alumni officers to be the

Daufenbach Donates
Lost Loot to Losers

“Some University undergraduates
will be lucky today when William
(Bill) Daufenbach, assistant to the
dean of men, hands out Christmas
gifts in the Information room, first
ﬂoor, Cathedral.

Hats, gloves, books on psychology
and speech, Old Oxford city direc-
tories, umbrellas, gloves, books, and
gloves will be distributed to the first
hundred students to appear. “This is
better than a New Deal,” Mr. Daufen-
bach maintains. “Gifts for the
gifted!”

There is a slight catch. The gifts
will be given only to those students
who lost them during semester, and
who can prove it!

Newman Club

Women Initiate

Sophomore Day »

Adding to the number of days set
aside by the University to commem-
orate special events—-—Woman’s Day,
Scholar’s Day, Tap Day—the class
of 1942 has inaugurated Sophomore
Day.

Sophomore Day, which will be held
every Tuesday on the twelfth ﬂo-or, is
designed to promote friendship be-

tween class members. “Come up and

Glenn, C, and Florence Biegal, C, co-
chairmen.

First of the series of days will be
held on Tuesday, January 2. Tea
will be served during the afternoon,
and the program will feature enter-

tainment by several members of the l

sophomore class.

During the remainder of this year,
the tea committee hopes to present
on their program many sophomores
who have talent in entertainment
ﬁelds. Any class members who feel
qualiﬁed should consult either Miss
Biegal or Miss Glenn.

Besides the Sophomore Day, activ-
ities , the class of 1942 will have sev-
eral members prepare tea each aft-
ernoon for any organization desiring
this service, reveals Mary Wilcox, C,
president.

‘Nothing to Say’
-—Dr. Bowman

On Athletic Code

Ochsenhirt Defends
Sports Policy Censure
. Before Varsity Club

Ofﬁcial Universityopinion on Dr.
Norman Ochsenhirt’s speech before
the Varsity Letter Club Monday night
was, for the most part, still unex-

' pressed today. . ;

Chancellor John G. Bowman re-
fused to make a speciﬁc comment on
the address made at a. banquet hon-

oring coaches and members of the’

football teamwhich charged the Uni-
versity with “hypocrisy in the ad-
ministration of its athletic policy.”

“There’s really nothing to be said,”
he stated. -

The athletic office reported that
James Hagan, director of athletics,
was out of town and could not be
reached for comment.

When questioned
marks, Ochsenhirt pointed out that
he “wasn’t taking a crack at Pitt. but
rather trying to present a picture of
general collapse practices. We (the
Varsity Letter Club) would like to
see the whole business cleared up
everywhere.”

Hinting at athletic practices at
Ohio State, Ochsenhirt stated Mon-
day evening “Pitt has yet to change
the place of residence of any of its
athletes so as to enable them to ob-
tain free tuition and farcical, po-
litical jobs on the state payroll.”

Defending his recent statement
that the Code Bowman was is being
broken every day in order to try to
become adjusted to a situation pecul-
iar to the University and Western
Pennsylvania, Ochsenhirt told the
News, “We have all the facts but we
don’t want to release them now and
stir up more controversy.”

Criticizing the administration of
the present athletic policy at the ban-
quet, Ochsenh.irt said, Monday, “If
we are to continue to have subsidiza-
tion in college athletics, and without

much questiomwe are, lettus beihon-».

est about it. Let our athletic codes
be honest about it.”

Santa Claus, Doughnuts Share
Honors at Commons Room Tea

Anyhow, as the New York Sun an-
nually tells Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus.

It all started Wednesday when the
poinsettias, tall candles, and the tang
of evergreens lured us into the Com-
mons Room. We were relieved when
a tubby Santa appeared, even though
we had none of the doubts which
bothered Virginia.

Then it started. We heard cries
of “Free beer” (a case of wishful
thinking, we’re afraid), but Santa
was only passing out bags of candy.

they weren’t Panther leftovers, so we

Men Students
May Get Jobs

For Christmas

Men who will remain in Pittsburgh
over the holidays may have an op-
portunity to get a part—time job, if
they already haven’t found one by
keeping in close contact with the
Men’s Employment Service, Edward
B. Williams, director, advises. ‘

Calls from department stores
haven’t come up to expectations, he
reveals, but this is probably due to
the fact that the stores are afraid of
a repetition of last year’s situation
when they optimistically hired more
people than they could use.

Business in the downtown district
has improved, and Mr. Williams feels
that student employment will in-
crease. He points out that clubs and
organizations will need student wait-
ers and other workers for Christmas
and New Year’s. “We expect a fair
demand from these organizations,”
he said.

The Employment Service, which
has done everything from hiring blood
donors to hiring students whose job
it was to sleep on air cushioned mat-
tresses every night for two weeks,
registered over 550 men last year for
part-time work. Of the 217 requests
for students, 164 were ﬁlled, 1,065
students receiving employment.

Street lights around the campus
will not be lighted during the week
so that the full eﬁect of the scheme
will be seen by passers—by.

The Trustee Investigation:
Changes Recommended

The University Board of Trustees, which meets next Tuesday,
will probably discuss the report of its special investigating com-
mittee, along with Chancellor Bowman ’s answer to that report,

This report suggests several deﬁnite adjustments in the organi-
zation a.nd operation. of the University. The committee, composed
of seven members of the Board, declared that their recommenda-
tions “will, if properly executed, do much to strengthen the Uni-
versity.” ,

Explanations which the Chancellor made in his answer to the
report apparently convinced the Board that further study was neces-
sary, for it referred the matter to its executive committee at the
last meeting.

These recommendations to the Board include several important
proposals:

1. That certain adjustments be made in the University oﬂices
of general administration to clarify the duties of the oiﬁcials, and
to improve press relations.

2. Formation of a council of deans for advice on administrative
policies. 

3. Formation of a faculty council on educational policies.

4. That trustees inform themselves more completely on Uni-
versity affairs.

5. Formation of a faculty-administration committee to prepare
a code of tenure of appointment to _be recommended to the Board
of Trustees.

6. As soon as Universityincome permits, raising faculty sal-
aries, and further improving libraries, laboratories, and student
“club” facilities.

7. That the Faculty Committee on Athletics adopt the Western
Conference Code, or a similar group-code, as University athletic
regulations. ‘-

It is not likely that the Board can take ﬁnal action on any of
these problems at Tuesday’s meeting, because plans for any perma-
nent solution must be drafted carefully. But it is important that the
Board make some statement indicating what is to be done.

The News is anxious that its explanation of the present status
of the trustee report be considered as a constructive statement of the
situation at the University, not as “rattling the Pitt skeleton.”

We feel that every Pitt student should be informed about the
action of the Board of Trustees at this time, for any steps which
may be made will vitally affect the future of the University.

If the trustees intend to plan some action on the report, let them
make a statement to that effect next Tuesday. Complete silence in
this situation may harm the University. A clear statement of the
facts will provide a ﬁrm ground for future understanding.

Let’s Have the Facts
About Our Athletic Code

Probably what impressed many observers after hearing of the
recent address of Dr. Norman Ochsenhirt, president of the Varsity
Letter Club, was his statement that the Code Bowman was being
violated.

Yet as Dr. Ochsenhirt said, and as the University’s athletic
department has admitted, the code i.s being adjusted to adapt it to
our peculiar conditions. Thus, it is not so important that there are
charges of “violations,” as it is important that students know what
these changes are.

If the code as printed is no longer strictly applicable, then
which sections are valid and which are not? If some rules are being
changed or voided, what are the reasons for such changes by the
Faculty Committee on Athletics?

Students should know the answers to these questions. For how
else can they be expected to keep faith in our athletic policy in the
face of the repeated attacks it has faced-—especially the holier-than-
thou attacks from other schools, including our new—found friends
of the Big Ten?

V\7e might point out the implied condescension of Ohio State in
scheduling Pitt when their athletic director stated he was satisﬁed
that Pitt had “regained its amateur standing.”

If the Code Bowman is changed, let us have the facts, so that
every student may know the University’s athletic policy and be
able to answer such comments by our “friends.”

It So - tile Hope

‘With this issue the News suspends publication until next
.Ve31‘- And S0, 1301" the editors and for the staff, may we offer these
wishes for the holiday season.

Vile hope that all the out-of-town students are able to get home
for Christmas and that those who live in Pittsburgh are able to
see a little more of their families than they have for the past months.

VVe hope that during these two weeks people and events will
slide back into their proper perspective and that we all will return
with clearer minds. ,

We hope that the whole world will know a little more of peace
on earth, goodwill to men and a little less of the “he-hit—me--ﬁrst”
philosophy. _

And we hope that all the things you wish and all the things
we wish will somehow come true.

The Panther Roars!

Among the ﬁned of articles crowded out of today’s Pitt News
by the Cln;-istmas flood of advertising was our review of the Decem-
ber Panther.

Vile really didn’t intend to slight Fanny Panther, so we’ll take
this opportunity of complimenting the staff of the humor monthlv
for its best issue of the year. i

The sales appeal of the December issue wasn’t conﬁned to the
fat bag on candy on the cover; the art work was exceptionally good,
the football feature by Dick Cassiano and Frank Kristufek scored
a hit, and Fanny Panther’s letter to the students was tops in Christ-
mas fun. , . , _ ,

Editor Mel Perring is continuing her attempt to make the Pa11-
ther rise out of the class of two-line joke magazines, and her lates
production indicates that her staff is doing a ﬁne job. A

Pittpourri

By THE KRISTUFEKS

See as how this will be our last
dirt column this year we will let
you in on the big secret of what
some of our biggest men and women
on campus will be doing with their
valuable time this Christmas vaca-
tion . Many of the lads and
lassies will go away for the holidays
while others, not so lucky, will stay
around town working at Various oc-
cupations, for the purpose of re-
plenishing the bankroll.

Kaufmamfs will have Jane Ep-
ping, Mary Grace Winnett, Jack
“Wolf” Brady, Mary Lou Perring,
Adeline Butera, Patsy Deans, Mary
Lewis, Kenny Kunkleton, Betty
Springer, and Midge Frobuck punch-
ing their time-clock while Gimbels
will carry on with Charlotte Harris,
Jean Brink, Gretchen Schutte, and
Sam “Don Budge” Whiteman.

Where They W0 rk

Isn’t it a funny world? Emil
“Playboy” Narick, Paul Foley, D.
J. Bailey, Ernie Bonelli, Pat Cusick,
Al Ferrara, and Ralph Green used to
play post—ofﬁce in their youth but
now that they are grown—up men
they will be working there for the
shekels instead of for fun . .
Mansmanns in East Liberty will
have Bob “Junior Prom” Shaw and
Doris Weaver while Adele Yorio
will answer the roll call at Sears
and Roebuck on the Northside . . .
Betty Duﬁ’ie].d and Jane Spencer
will put in their hours at Homes
and Rosalie Andoli.no will do like-
wise at Becks . . . Freda Jaffe and
Peggy Brennan will work for their
pa-pas who are in the clothing and
contracting businesses respectively.

Where They G0

Among the lucky people who will
go away during the interim are Jim
Kennedy, Delt prexv, who will go
to his home in Grand Rapids, Mich-
igan . . . Senator Ziskind will visit
his brother at Yale, New Haven

. . Sam Bonavita will go home to
Warren, Pa.

Dick Kaye is bound for Charles-
ton, W. Va. . . . Barnesboro, Pa.,
will put up with Joe McCormick

. and ﬁnally, beneath the palm
trees somewhere in Florida may be
found Dr. Ferguson, Economics pro-
fessor, Ben Grady, varsity swim-
ming coach, with most of the boys
on the team. Bob Machesney, pub-
lications adviser, and the two
disher—outers of this so-called col-
umn . . . We can hear the Florida
Chamber of Commerce beating their
drums now . . . Seen at the Oasis,
a popular nitery, were several of
our more prominent football play-
ers. . .

Hall of Fame

For this week’s Pittpourri Hall of
Fame we intended to select Jim
Napier, that popular PiKA lad who
will lead the Yuletide Festival to-
night but we just found out that
Bill “Ironman” Daufenbach still be-
lieves in Santa Claus so in order not
to disappoint him we are selecting
Santa as the man of the year. How’s
that, Bill? We hope that the rest
of you fellows and girls won’t tell
Bill about Santa being dead.

When we were ﬁfteen years old
and started to ask questions, our
mother told us that the beloved old
man of the North fell out of his
sled one night and was killed.
That’s when we knew he wouldn’t
be around any more . . . Because
Santa didn’t have a wife, as our
woman of the year we pick Mary
Christmas, his little helper

AYC Declares
Jobs Necessary
For Young People

WASHINGTON, D. C.——(ACP)-—-
Because idle youth will strengthen
any movement to embroil this na-
tion in the present European war,
the federal government must pro-
vide employment for the young who
cannot ﬁnd work in private in-
dustry.

That is the assertion of the Amer»
ican Youth Commission, a division
of the American Council on Educa-
tion, in its new “program of action
for American youth.”

“In the present critical situation,"
the report continued, “it is impera-
tive that none of the human re-
sources of the nation be wasted
through haphazard and~inefﬁcient
methods of Vocational selection,
preparation and employment.

“Society in each generation has
an obligation to provide for youth
full opportunities for vocational ex-
ploration, training and public serv-
ice. The existence of a world
crisis, by making clear to the na-
tion the need for internal as well as
external strength, serves only to
emphasize the present obligation.

“Much time has been lost and
too many young people already
have a history of frustration and
wasted years. There is all the more
reason for strengthening this weak

point in the national fabric as soon .

as possible, now that its dangerous
nature is evident.”

The plan of the commission calls
for training youth in public em-
ployment that will give them ex-
perience for jobs in private indus-
try. The work would be directed

by those who could instill in the"

youth good work habits as well as
specific skills. Cost of the pro-
gram was estimated at $400 per
worker per year.

In The Mail

Editor, the Pitt News:

Since the 29th of November, the
staff of the Culinaire Restaurant on
Craig St. has been on strike. The
dispute with the management arose
over wages, hours, conditions of
work and union recognition.

Among the conditions which the
management has failed to rectify in-
clude wages as low as seven dollars
a week, which, in some classiﬁca-
tions is only one—half the union
rate and irregular hours which force
some of the staff members to work
seven days at a stretch, at times,
and other member to work as long
as 14 hours a day.

Nor does the management provide
uniforms as is done in most restaur-
ants, and this, along with other
charges, forces the girls to spend
a large part of their meager wages
on items ordinarily paid for by the
employer.

It is interesting that most of the
other restaurants in Oakland are
capable of maintaining union stand-
ards and successfully negotiating
with their organized employees. The
Schenley Hotel, the Webster Hall
Hotel, Betsy Ross, Gammons, Uni-
versity Grill, the Luna, Villa d’Este,
Mitchells, J immy’s, and many of the
other eating places in Oakland
maintain union standards.

Therefore, we, the undersigned,
feel that University students and
organizations should aid in rectify-
ing these bad conditions by not
crossing the picket line or entering
the Culinaire Restaurant until the
strike is settled satisfactorily.

Lumber Group Awards

Engineering Graduate

Alfred C. Ackenheil, honor grad-
uate of the School of Engineering
last June, was recently awarded sec-
ond prize of $100 in a national con-
test in timber bridge design spon-
sored by the National Lumber Man-
ufacturers association.

Ackenheil received the award of
the Pittsburgh section of the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers as
the outstanding Pittsburgh graduate
in civil engineering last year. He
is now doing graduate work in en-
gineering at Harvard.

Counsel to Display
Hobby Collections

Arrangements for the display of
student hobby collections are being
made by Men’s Council, announces
Henry DeRocher, M40, president.

The exhibition will be held in the
ﬁne arts department sometime in
January. Men’s Council hopes to
start several hobby clubs to pro-
vide students, not participants in
extra-curricular activities, with an
opportunity to become acquainted
with other undergraduate students
at the University.

Interested students may obtain
additional information from mem-
bers of Men’s Council and may reg-
ister their entries in the dean of
men’s office.

Business Hits High

Peak in November

Pittsburgh business was boosted in
November to a new high of 130.6 per
cent of the 1923-1925 average in the
same month, according to the Univer-
sity’s Bureau of Business Research.

Gains were reported in all branches
of business last month and the sea-
sonal peak in the steel and bitumin-
ous industry was passed. Retail sales

rshowed decided improvement.

The index of trade advanced more
than seven per cent from October to
November, and the volume of trade
was 17 per cent greater than Novem-
ber of last year. Department store
sales in Pittsburgh were 14 per cent
ahead of the same four weeks preced-
ing December 2 of last year.

Carnegie International

Because of war conditions abroad,
none of the European paintings will
be returned to their native lands. The
American canvasses will be returned
to the artists. —

The-_ 180 European canvasses will
hang in the third floor galleries of
Carnegie institute through Janu-
ary 21.

Earthquake! 2

Student Delves Into Seismology;
Comes Up Shaken, but No Wiser

By Mary Lou Caldwell

“I-lot news!” yelled the editor. “The
seismology department has a large
earthquake. Get the story.”

This was a ﬁne assignment, espe-
cially as this reporter had never
heard of such a department. So we
trotted around the Cathedral until we
located D. C. Bradford, the head of
the department. Mr. Bradford hails
from Texas, and likes to smoke.

To get back to the earthquake, we
found that it occurred somewhere in
the West Indies or Honduras on De-
cember 5, at 3:35 o’clock in the morn-
ing. We were thankful for that, for
we like our sleep. Mr. Bradford
pointed to a long machine in his of-
ﬁce, covered with innumerable gadg-
ets. We gleaned one intelligent fact
from the ensuing lecture on the pur-
pose and workings of said machine
—you -can tune in on dance bands.

Then followed a trek on foot (Mr.
Bradford doesn’t trust elevators)
down to the basement. We were led
into a chamber with another large
gadget whose name we can’t spell.

Chemists Hear Dr. Lowy

New developments in the chemical
industries were described to junior
and senior chemistry specials, chem-
ical engineers, and graduate students

der Lowy, professor of chemistry.

Dr. Lowy’s address reviewed the
Exposition of Chemical Industries
held last week in New York city.

There were two grandfather clocks,
beautifully carved, on which the
whole seismograph setup is dependent
for accuracy.

Behind this was a smaller chamber
which looked like the springhouse
back on the farm. On a raised plat-
form in the center were three seismo-
graphs, which cost a thousand dol-
lars each. From them, there were
cables going ten feet underground.
They record something or other.

This little basement laboratory is
equipped with a developing room.
There are red lights in it, so dim that
we had to be led around by the hand.
The records are developed here; they
are long, heavy papers, about three
feet long, covered with little jaggy
lines. Mr. Bradford showed us the
one on which the earthquake was
recorded. The lines are more jagged
than ordinary and they look like
small mountains.

The whole trip was intelligently
and thoroughly described by Mr.
Bradford. It made us wish we knew
what a seismograph was!

Carlsonmen Open A

With Swing Through Mid-West

Panthers F ace
Butler Tonight
In Opening Tilt

By Phil Lynch

It will be a pugnacious Bulldog
heckling a gnarling, gnashing Panther
tonight when the Golden Jungle Cats
of the University of Pittsburgh, alias
“the glamor boys” or “the ice cream
kids,” inaugurate the 1939-40 basket-
ball season by swapping shots and
dribbles with a midwestern “pride
and joy,” Butler University, Ind.iana
Conference champions and one time
bearer of the national crown.

Before the crowd mills out of spa-
cious Butler ﬁeldhouse, Indianapolis’
basketball pavilion, Pitt’s Dr. Carlson
will have rooted his eighteenth sea-
son deep in basketball annals and
the Pittsburgh athletes will have
bumped against the ﬁrst acid test of
a grueling season.

Initial Battle

Pitt’s prospects are not any too
promising as they await their initial
court battle. Eddie Straloski is suf-
fering a knee injury which may keep
him out of the starting line up, and
“Ripper” Collins, stocky sophomore,
may be of little help to the Panther
cagers because of a hip injury ac-
quired during a touch football game.

Play on the Stadium court has
been listless and, as yet, there is no
single position deﬁnitely assured.
Still, if paper jottings and pre-season
dope are symbolic of how a team

should shape up, the Panthers have

little to fear.

The “sophomore team” of last year‘,
Straloski, Klein, Milanovich, Port,
Kocheran, Pataky, and Vujnovic, re-
turns aided by the appearance of four
freshman stars, Collins, Egan, Ziol-
kowski, and Levin. At times, the
squad has flashed a brilliant attack
and ﬁerce defense, while on other oc-
casions, they have lapsed into “bad
spells.”

Opened Vvell Last Year

Freshman players, out of intercol-
legiate play because of University
ruling, have held the varsity on even
terms at two sessions. The fresh-
men, a combine of Swacus, Malarky,
Masten, Silverman, Artman, Loh—
meyer and Rice, are a good aggre-
gate of frosh players, but by all rules
of logic, Dr. Carlson’s proteges should
hold an upper hand.

Incidently, a disastrous trip was
expected of the cagers last year as
they swung into the Middle West, but
they rode back into the Pennsylvania
station with the tests of four victo-
ries in five attempts.

Bradley Tech, rated as national
champions by many of the experts

EDDIE STRALOSKI 4
may not start
>x= * *

last year, found out that Pitt could
cause exciting moments and were
only too happy to just beat the
Panthers.

Delving into last year’s Pitt records,
we find that they copped 10 contests
and lost eight. They started strong,
sagged in mid season, but ﬁnished
with six wins in the last seven en-
gagements.

Four Seniors on Squad

They beat Northwestern, Duke,
Richmond, Cornell, Temple, Carnegie
Tech, Georgetown, Fordham and
West Virginia. Accounting for the
Pitt losses were Carnegie Tech, Brad-
ley Tech, Westminster, Duquesne,
West Virginia, Penn State and Tem-
ple.

There are but four seniors on a six-
teen man squad, Johnson, Scherer,
Ptacek, and Mendlow, thus most of
the success will depend on junior and
sophomores.

The Panthers entrained yesterday
evening for points west, meeting
Butler on the ﬁfteenth, Northwestern
on the sixteenth, Indiana on the
eightheenth, Ohio State on the thir-
tieth, and Michigan on New Year’s
day as part of a double header at
Columbus, Ohio.

Northwestern is the only repeater
of the 1939 season, and the other four

colleges, three of them Big Ten stand-

Alex Slobodian Elected Captain
Of 1939-4+0 Varsity Swim Teani

Alex Slobodian, C40, University
backstroke ace, was unanimously
chosen as swimming captain at an
informal meeting of the team mem-
bers last Monday.

This will be Slobodian’s third year
on the squad. During his sophomore
year he ﬁrst won attention by placing
high in several important meets. In
intercollegiate competition, he ﬁnish-
ed second in the Eastern Intercolle-
giate backstroke championships, his
most important contribution as a
sophomore.

His outstanding achievement in
free style racing was that of breaking
the North Park pool record for 100
yards, a record held for some time
by Russ Lindberg, former Pitt var-
sity swimmer. Slobodian also added

the Junior AMA 100 yard free style .

title to his list of successes for the
year.

Slobodian showed his value as
team member by competing on the
championship free style relay team.

His junior year was climaxed by
his winning of the Eastern Intercol-
legiate backstroke championship, but
throughout the year, he proved a val-
uable point-getter for the paddle-
and-splash men.

In addition to the election of S10-
bcdian, the business of the meeting
last Monday included a discussion by
coach Grady of plans for the meets
which are to be held this year. The
Panther’s ﬁrst meets are scheduled
for late in January.

outs, appear for the ﬁrst time on
the Pitt schedule. The Jungle Cats
opened their last year’s season with
Northwestern and spilled them by a
48-37 score, a game in which Stral-
oski split the net with many of his
long shots.

With the collapse of the Eastern
conference, a breakdown which af-
fected many district teams, Pitt has
dropped Temple and Georgetown.
They al.so will not meet Duquesne,
Duke, Bradley Tech, Richmond and
have substituted Waynesburg, Navy
and Geneva in addition to those al-
ready mentioned.

Out of the west little word has

ponents, and all that is known are
the ﬁgures of the past season. Ohio
State has Johnny Kincaid, All—Amer—
ican forward, returning. Indiana
rests their hopes on nine returning
lettermen. Michigan expects ﬁve let-
ter bearers to “bring home the ba-
con,” among them footballer Tommy

nother Season

come of the possibilities of Pitt op-

Harmon and captain James Rae, the
only two year man on the squad.

The Blue and Gold quintet will
start the season without three old
faces missing, Harry Paffrath who
dropped out of school but expects to
return next season, Eddy Lawry, cap-
tain of last year, and Jack Scott.

Nine lettermen are returning:
Johnson, Scherer, and Ptacek, sen-
iors, Vujnovic, Milanovich, Straloski,
Pataky, Port, Kocheran and Klein,
juniors. Stepping up from fresh-
man ranks to lend a hand to the var-
sity are Egan, Collins, Ziolkowski,
and Levin.

Win ’Em All

Critics expect little of this year’s
squad, mainly because of the erratic
showing that Pitt has displayed. At
times, they move fast and ﬂash rare
form; then either because of over-
confidence or staleness, a slump fol-
lows. It is expected that sophomore
“Lefty” Ziolkowski and senior
Charley Ptacek will add lustre to the
squad.

However, there is every reason to
believe that the Blue and Gold will
be the “win-’ern-all’ year‘ that Dr.
Carlson so often talks about.

The starting line-up is sketchy but
it is expected that Straloski and Klein
will start at the forwards, Port at
center, and Kocheran with Milane-
vich at the guard positions. The
probable Pullman riders besides
those mentioned are Scherer, Ziol-

kowski, Vujnovic, Pataky, and

Ptacek.

Zephyrs, Pitt Club Retain

Clean Slates

on Forfeits

Jerks, College Hicks, Phys Ed Majors Breeze
To Easy Wins; AE & ME Five Tops Electricals

Two teams won forfeits to remain
unbeaten after Wednesday’s basket-
ball games.

The Zephyrs kept their slate clean
by winning the easy way over the
Evening school team, and also re-
gained some of the prestige lost by
their fellow freshman team, the
Blizzards, at the hands of the New-
mans. Both the Blizzards and the
Zephyrs are the proud prizes of Dr.
Paul Zehfuss.

The Pitt Club won their second
forfeit victory in succession when
the Gamma Gamma Woos failed to
show up for their scheduled con-
test. The win kept the Pitt Club
in the unbeaten class.

A well—polished offense and a tight
defense helped the Jerks defeat the
B B Boys 35-12. Vardaro and Hjnte
tied for the high scoring honors with
10 points.

Both the Chem Engineer Sophs
and the Civils were charged with a
loss when neither was present for
their game.

With Kercal rolling up 14 points,
the Phys Ed Majors defeated the
YMCA by a 38-11 score in what was
perhaps the most thrilling game of
the day.

Shank led the AE & ME five with
six points, as the Aereo boys tripped
the Electricals, 18-14. The College
Hicks smeared the Chem Frosh, 27-
10, with Goeltz and McKenna tieing
for scoring honors with 10 points
each. Two more forfeits resulted in
the Metallurgists and the Wolves
winning from the Industrials and
Gypsies respectively.

“Brilliant Corsages By Gidas”

In table tennis, the Delta Tau
Delta boys whitewashed the Phi
Kaps by winning all twelve games
played.

Bowling matches included: Kappa
Sigs 3, Phi Eps 0; Phi Delts 2, Sig-
ma Chi 1; Delts 2, Phi Kaps 1; Phi
Gams 2, Theta Chi 1; and Pi Lams
2, Lambda Chi 1.

Thrilling games were the rule last
Tuesday night as the fraternity boys
put on a real basketball show.

In the PiKA-SAM game, the PiKAs
nosed out the Sammies, 21-19. Elling,
PiKA guard, topped the scorers with
nine points. Colton, forward of the
SAM team, paced the losers with six.

Another thriller was staged when
the Phi Eps and Lamba Chi clashed.
When the game was over, the Lamb-
da Chi team had walked off with a
close 23-21 victory. Toth played
brilliant offensive ball throughout the
game as he scored 12 points for the
winners. Joe Coplin, captain of the
Phi Eps, led his team with eight
points. .

Phi Kappa won 1'rom the Kappa
Sigs, 23-19. Jack Glenn led the
winners in the scoring column with
seven points, while footballer Kra-
cum contributed nine to the lost Kap-
pa Sig cause.

In other games played, the Theta
Chis trounced the weak Delta
Tau Delta team, 23-8, as Jones and
Fitchko led the scoring with eight
and seven points respectively. An-
derson and Jones paced the Phi Delts
in victory over the Sigma Chis 19-8,
and the Phi Garn powerhouse swamp-
ed SAE, 31-13. Bobby Thurbon con-
tributed 10 points to the Fiji total.

FBGM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL McELWAﬂV'
Sports Editor

JUST WHEN GOOD CHEER is supposed to be ﬁlling hearts with
gladness and the brotherhood of man, word reaches us that all is
deﬁnitely not well in intramural circles. The members of the inde-
pendent basketball league are, in a word, griped.

The problem seems to be Whether there is justiﬁcation for the
entrance of two teams of freshman basketball stars into intramural
competition. Ordinarily this question would not arise, but since the
Unmegpsity has decided against freshman intercollegiate competition,
int:-amliral tea.ms have the frosh laid :in their laps.

Under the present setup, the freshman squad is divided into two
teams, one composed of “inexperienced” boys, the other made up of
‘fsliglitly experienced” players. The “inexperienced” team is not
nun.-h objected to, although Newman Club, last year’s champs, had
(li‘t‘tic.lllty winning over them, 21-19.

It’s the other combination which is drawing the wrath of intra-
mural rivals. Included on the roster are the University ’s usual quota
of former high school stars, lnany of them All~City or All-WPIAIJ
perforlne-rs. Against such a ball club, other intramural outﬁts feel
that they just wouldn’t have a chance, and there certainly seems
to be a strong backing for that argument.

Considered impartially, the inclusion of the freshman aces in
i.n.tramure.ls would seem on the unwise side. The general calibre of
intrainural play is improved by their participation but it is question-
able whether the other clubs will be content to scramble for the scraps
while the future varsity men romp off with the what-ever cups, tro-
phies and honors are to be had.

FOOTBALL MEN ARE going in for track, it would appear. The
Amateur Athlete, official publication of the Amateur .Ath.letic union,
has published an All—American that includes only men who h.ave also
been outstanding in track and ﬁeld competition.

Southern California ’s Bob Peoples and Elmer Hackney of Kans-is
State, record-holders in the javelin and shot put respectively, team in
the backﬁeld with broad jumper Jack Robinson of U. C. L, A., and
John Mcliaughry, hammer thrower from Brown.

Iiinemen are discus thrower Archie Harris, of Indiana, and shot
putter ‘Nilbur Strode of U. C. L. A. at ends; U. S. C.’s Phil Casper
and Tulane ’s Millard VVhite, both discus throwers, at tackles; Bill
Kirchem, Tulane sprinter, and hammer thrower Phil Perkins of Bow-
doin at guards; and Stan Anderson, Stanford shot put'ter at center.

Here at Pitt we could mention the name of tackle Ted Konetsky,
a letterman in shot putting and discus throwing. If Carl Olson, the
“little king” of University track an.d ﬁeld had his way, there would
be several additions to his squad from the ranks of the gridders. Olson
has a hunch that Bobby Thurbon, George Kracum, Johnny Dicltinsoll
and Bill Benghouser would all look good in track suits.

‘With four lettermen back at end, Earl Pressel’s chances of earn-
ing a. varsity letter in football are getting slimmer and slimmer, but
there ’s more than just a chance that Earl would make a first class
quarter-miler or mile relay man, and, incidentally, a letter winner.

Christmases and Happy New Years, The Pitt News sport staff takes

The Pitt News

News Releases ,
Concensus Club

Of ‘All’ Teams

Harry Smith Chosen
As Captain of Eleven,
Only Unanimous Choice

By Ben Foot-e
Since no one has yet found a suc-
cessor to Walter Camp, and no All-

’ American can be termed ofﬁcial, the

Pitt News has decided that the near-
est approach to an impeccable all star
selection must develop from a con-
sensus of all the major All-American
elevens.

In conducting our survey we used
the following selections; Grantland
Rice, Co1lier’s; Col1ier’s Eye; Bill
Stern; Life; Movie-tone; Paramount
News; New York Sun; New York
News; Collegiate Sports Writers;
NEA; United Press; International
News Service; Associated "Press;
Hearst.

The Line

At ends we have Ken Kavanaugh
of Louisiana State and Bill Kerr of
Notre Da.me. For three years Kav-
anaugh has specialized in outwitting
enemy backﬁeld men to snag touch-
down passes.

Ground gained around Kerr’s end
has always been a minus quantity,
and he thinks nothing of taking a
200-pound tackle out on his way for
a forward pass.

To two junior giants, Harley Mc-
Collum of Tulane and Nick Drahos
of Cornell, go the tackle positions.
lVIcCollum was slated for a second
team berth at the beginning of the
season, but he broke up first team
plays with such regularity that he
had to be shoved into front ranks.

Versatile, aptly named Drahos is
the East’s lone representative and
polled the second highest number of
votes in the concensus. I-Ie slayecl
opponents by place kicking ﬁeld goals
after playing most of the game in
his rival’s backﬁeld.

Harry Smith, Southern California
senior, and Bob Suffridge, Tennessee
junior, are the guards. Smith, hon-
orary captain of this a1l—star outﬁt,
was our only unanimous choice. His
208 pounds of dynamite received first
team rating on every selection.

The Backfield

Suffridge just edged his teammate
Bob Molinski for the other guard po-
sition. Bob Neyland’s backs had lit-
tle trouble avoiding enemy tacklers
with this great downﬁeld blocker
clearing the way.

Northwestern’s John Haman, sen-
ior center, ﬂashed to stardom in his
first game in mid-season of 1937.
Cut from a block of concrete, this six
foot two inch, 215 pounder was the
Wildcat defense.

The backﬁeld men: George Cafego,
of Tennessee, Tom Harmon of Mich-
igan, Nile Kinnick of Iowa, and John-
ny Kimbrough of Texas A & M, ran
and passed opposing teams dizzy.

Cafego, a great punter as well as
the best broken ﬁeld runner to dart
over southern gridirons since Don
Zimmerman of Tulane, could weave
through a ﬁeld clogged with oppo-
nents. Tom Harmon put on a one-
man show every time out.

Kimbrough hit like a fast freight
under full steam. Nile Kinnick, the
player of the year, has been eulogized
to such a great extent, that nothing
we could say would add to his fame.

To Santa . . . From Bertie

By Bert Jaffe

Christmas comes but once a year, usually on the twenty-ﬁfth of De-
cember, and we of the sports department would like to wish a few gifts to
our many friends.

We begin with Frank Carver, Bill McJunkin, and Andy Ferguson. The
ﬁrst one is the publicity director for athletics, and the other two are stooges.

If Mr. Carver will look in his stock-
ing on Christmas morning (that’s the
sock without the hole) he will ﬁnd
one slightly-used hair brush.

Ferguson and McJunkin go hand
in hand, so We offer them one rope
for skipping purposes. And we don’t
mean to skip class. We also hope
that the Chancellor will sign their
diplomas when Commencement rolls
around.

Coaches Remembered

For Jimmy Hagan, the athletic di-
rector, we give the good wishes of
both Buff Donelli and “Legs” Hawley,
the former of Duquesne and the lat-
ter from West Virginia.

And we mustn’t forget the various
coaches of the University’s athletic
teams, namely Bowser, Carlson, Ol-
son, Potts, Mitterling, Grady, and
Zehfuss.

As basketball is in season, we will
take up the case of the good Dr. Carl-
son. We’re positive nothing would

A consistant winning pitcher, a
hard hittng outﬁelder, and an error-
less inﬁeld should fit right into Coach
Mitterling’s baseball plans. What
more can he ask for? Frankie Frisch
will settle for the same thing.

Players

To Appear on Campus

Tentative Plans Call for Exchange of Shows
On Home to Home Basis Between Schools

Returning the Pitt Players’ visit to their campus last year, the
Ohio State Players, dramatic troupe from Ohio State, will make a
one night presentation of “Dark Victory” the first week in January,
it was announced today by Joseph Miller, BA40, business manager

of Pitt Players.

Tentative plans have b e e n
worked out for a home to home
basis each year between the two
schools. Last year the University
players went on the road with
“Brother Rat” and this year “Adding
Machine” is the probable ro-ad play.

Dorothy I. Lambert, director of the
Ohio State production, will bring ap-
proximately twenty players, plus the
additional students necessary for pro-
duction set-up.

The group will come direct from
their own campus, remain overnight
at some of the fraternity houses and
hotels and return home the next
morning.

Admission to the play is not in-
cluded with the seasonal pass sold
by Pitt Players, but separate tickets
for 50 cents will be sold.

The play, “Dark Victory,” was a
hit on Broadway with Talluah Bank-
head playing the lead, and in the
movie version, which was also a suc-
cess, Bette Davis, many time Acad-
emy Award winner, played the lead
with George Brent as the male star.

Written by Bertram Bloch and
George Brewer, Jr., the play as pre-
sented by the Ohio State Players will .
have two scenes. One is an indoor
party scene and the other a bedroom
setting.

This is the ﬁrst time in the history
of the University that an exchange

of Pitt Players that the Ohio State
presentation will be received with as

The Pay-Off

Publications to Bury
Hatchet, Hold Party

Approximately 2,100,003 seconds
have been spent by students work-
ing on the University’s publications
this year. After the afternoons and
evenings spent in smoke-ﬁlled rooms
with monotonous banging typewriters
all around, students will ﬁnally be
rewarded.

Today they will receive one box
of candy worth approximately 10
cents.

News hounds, Panther salesmen
and Owlers will get together today
at 2:30 o’clock in Heinz House for a
Christmas party, featured by the dis-
tribution of so-called presents.

Jack Hoeveler, C40, not-too-well
known busness manager of a not-too-
well known University publication
is in charge of the affair and prom-
ises plenty of recordings for danc-
ing, lots of refreshments and very
few speeches.

Faculty advisers of the student
publications, the personnel of the
dean of men’s oﬁice and dean of wo-
men’s oﬁice will also attend.

All those students whose names
are listed in the mastheads of the
publications are invited.

Student Entertains at Banquets

With Comic One-Act Melodrama

D. J. Bailey, C42, attributes his
success as an entertainer to “brains
—-—just plain brains!” ,

This modest hero has been in de-
mand at about every University ban-
quet, smoker, and party be-cause of
his skill at taking all three parts in
an original little drama (his one and
only) called “Belinda The Heroine
Rudolph Rassendale The Villain and
Hairbreadth Harry The Hero.”

He has given his act at command
performances “before royalty —-— in-
cluding Chancellor Bowman!”

During the act, in which there is
a rapid exchange of hats to portray
the different characters, Bailey
changes his voice into a deep, manly

rumble (the hero’s); a high, squeaky
soprano (the heroine’s); and a low,
cowardly whine (you guessed it——-
the villain’s).

Bailey is called plain “D. J.” by
everyone (he refuses to give his ﬁrst
two names to anyone, and we doubt
if his mother knows it). He picked
up the act, while still in high school,
from “some fellow” whose name or
purpose in life he doesn’t remember.
Says Bailey, shyly, “I was much in
demand there, too.”

An active member of Pitt Play-
ers, “D. J.” is a member of Pi Kappa
Alpha social fraternity, Pitt Riﬂes,
Druids, an.d the Tuck Shop.
