But some students, parents and consumer

would emphasize to students, before they

apply, that when they use plastic to pay for 

an item, they are not getting something for
free. *

And if they don’t pay for it in a timely
manner, they may dim their chances for

PCI awarded funds for breast research

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

Breast cancer research will be

I broadened at the Pittsburgh

Cancer Institute through
National Cancer Institute grants.

NCI awarded PCI investiga-
tors more than $700,000 for a
research program that will
address: -how new anti-cancer
drugs kill breast tumor cells,
early cell --markers of aggressive
breast cancer, and mood and
changes in the immune system.

Half of the money will fund
pilot or development projects
dealing with breast cancer,
according to Dr. Ronald
Herberman, director of PCI. The
competition for the pilots should
begin in October, he said.

The remainder of the funds
will help in recruiting some
additional faculty members or
build more support within PCI,
he said.

“We are pleased to receive’
two grants which will expand
our efforts to translate research
findings into clinical tools for
diagnosing and treating breast
cancer,” Herberman said.

PCI received a two-year-grant
of $620,000 for the develop-

iment of a Breast Cancer

Research Program. This pro-
gram will concentrate on the
interactions of genetic,
endocrine and environmental
factors that affect breast cancer
tissue.

Herberman said NCI
expressed a particular interest in

the environmental factors deal-
ing with breast cancer since
there had been some areas in the
country where those "factors
increased breast cancer in
women.

The BCRP will also deal with
biobehavioral research which
includes studies of how exer-
cise, counseling and biofeed-
back affect breast cancer sur-
vivors. A multi-mode micro-
scope and computer software
from Biological Detection
Systems, which will allow
researchers to detect and study
breast tumor development as
well as collect images from live
tumor cells, will be purchased
through a $90,000 grant. This
microscope will also allow

Peggy Hightower, a
1994 Pitt graduate, was
stressed from working
full-time and attending
classes full-time until
she discovered the

After her discovery,
she no longer had any

“It was great knowing

Hightower said.

The Nursing

LOS ANGELES — A judge
denied a defense motion to
throw out the case against foot-
ball legend O.J. Simpson, who
is accused of murdering his ex-
wife and a friend, ruling that
there was enough evidence
against him for a trial.

Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge Lance Ito also ruled that a
search of Simpson’s $1.2 mil-
lion—dollar estate by detectives

without a search warrant was
legal. .

Simpson’s lawyers had
sought to have charges dis-
missed, arguing that there was
no probable cause to suspect
him of the crime.

But Ito said there was suffi-
cient reason to proceed with the
case, set to begin September 26,
given the evidence already pre-

For more Pitt students,
studying abroad may be
more affordable now than
ever before. Each year,
beginning in the spring of
1995, nearly $50,000 worth
of awards will be given to
Pitt students to study abroad.
The new scholarship fund,
which is too new to have a
name yet, was established
from two sources: the $l—per-
term study abroad scholar-

 

invoices toward a Study
Abroad Scholarship Fund.”
As a result, over 1,200 signa-
tures were collected. On the
November SGB elections
ballot, a referendum was

added which asked if voters ,

would be willing to pay $1
per term toward a study
abroad scholarship fund. This
vote passed with 1,054 in
favor and 414 against.

The idea for this scholar-

efforts, petitions were circu-
lated around campus which
said, “We, the undersigned

newly designed anti-cancer

grants through a competition
among NCI-designated centers
to help the already existing can-
cer center support groups.

According to the University
of Pittsburgh Health Sciences
News Bureau, these are only
two of 21 recent NCI grants to
PCI which total more than $3
million. Herberman said each
year over the past few years, the
money received from NCI has
been increasing.

“We have a very important.

tuition, resident hall accommodations, cafe-
teria dirring, ﬁeld trips and some local trans-

-Pitt’s Spring ’94 program to London got
such rave reviews that the Study Abroad
Office can’t wait to run it again this spring
term. Located in the heart of London, stu-
dents are just blocks away from the
Kensington Palace and Gardens, home of
Princess Diana. London is known as one of
the most vibrant, artistic and cultural cities in
Europe. It also provide easy access to main-
land Europe, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and
the rest of England. The changes made in
last year’s program are mostly academic in
nature. Students will take twelve to fifteen
credits in a variety of course and internship
combinations. There will be two courses
taught by Dr. Kathy George of Pitt’s theater
department and ﬁve other Pitt courses taught
by British faculty. Internships are also avail-
able in a variety of fields for students who
wish to complement their studies with a
practical work experience.

Participants have their choice of living
either with a host family or living in the
Field Court Center, a student residence in
Kensington. Sophomores, juniors and
seniors in any major with at least a 2.75
Q.P.A. are welcome to apply. The program
will start in mid—January and run until early
May. Program fees are expected to approxi-
mate in—state tuition, room and board at Pitt.
There will be two information sessions at
4E5l Forbes Quad. One will take place on
Sept. 22 from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., and the other
will be Sept. 23 from 12 p.m. to l p.m. At
these information sessions, students will be
able to hear from students who participated
last spring.

Most financial aid is applicable, and schol-
arships will be available for both of these
programs. For more detailed information and
applications, stop by the Study Abroad
Office, 4G Forbes Quadrangle (telephone:
648-7390), between 8:30 am. and 5 p.m.

the most popular forms of international
experience. As students realize the impor-
tance of gaining both work and study abroad
experience to build up their resurrrés, they
are seeking, and finding, programs which
offer internships in a variety of fields.

earn credits which are applicable
toward a Pitt degree. Some pro-
grams combine coursework with
the internship, while others are
designed so that students can
work ful1—ti1ne. With this option
students can, for example, work
for a major investment company
in Hong Kong or Singapore, for
a museum in Florence or Milan
or for Parliament in London or
Paris/. These are only a few
examples, as there are literally
hundreds of internship opportu-
nities in all disciplines.

Students usually must have a
good working knowledge of the
language of the host country;

students without language back-
ground will find plenty of
opportunities in the English-
speaking world.

The Study Abroad Office and
CAS Dean’s Office are currently
working on- a proposal to offer
even more internship opportuni-
ties to Pitt students at very rea-
sonable prices. For more infor-

In March, Susswein testified
before a U.S. House of
Representatives subcommittee,
where she called for personal
ﬁnance classes as early as junior
high and credit management
seminars in college. She said
education like this would help
students to learn how to use
credit before they apply for their
first card. “We don’t hand out
drivers licenses, then hope that
some day students will learn to
drive. Why dish out unsecured
credit and then hope students
can handle it?” Susswein told
the subcommittee.

Citibank, an issuer of Visa
and Mastercard, offers an edu-
cational package that revolves
around the adventures of “Max
Moore, Detective in
Moneytown.” The package
includes cassette tapes for col-
lege radio stations and layouts
for college newspapers.

Max interacts with college
students on fictional campuses
and gives them tips on how to
manage credit. The package
also includes a free booklet that
describes how to plan a personal
budget and defines some finan-
cial terms.

Susswein said she hasn’t seen
this particular package but has

seen the packages of other credit
issuers.

“If they’re making an effort,
then I commend them,” she
said. “But they tend to be too
vague and leave out some of the
important [information].” One
thing Susswein would like cred-
it card issuers to emphasize to
students is the importance of
making payments on time.

When credit card companies
receive a cardholder’s payment,
they record when they received
it on the card holder’s credit
record, said Maria Rullo, a
spokesperson for Citibank.

A credit card record scarred
by late payments may cause a
possible future employer or
lender to say, “I don’t want to
take a chance on this person,”
Susswein said. A blemish will
remain on a credit record for
seven years.

Pitt student Christina Szejk’s
consistent late payments on her
credit cards prevented her from
getting an apartment in her own
name. Her father had to co—sign
because of the glitches in her
credit history.

Szejk intended to get only one
credit card her sophomore year,
but free gifts at the application
tables swayed her to apply for
more.

“I really only wanted one, but

...I wanted a thesaurus, so I signed

up for all of them.” Szejk began
using the credit cards to take out
cash to pay for rent. She often
had enough money to make
minimum payments, but
wouldn’t mail them on time
because she didn’t have stamps
or because she just put it off.

Susswein said these seeming-
ly inconsequential actions can
have serious repercussions.

It’s hard for students to con-
vince themselves of this,
Susswein said, but if students
are not told upfront, they may
not be aware that the conse-
quences can plague them for
seven years.

So as long as representatives
from credit card companies are
“hawking their wares on cam-
pus,” they should walk over to a
conference room and hold “sub-
stantive seminars” informing
students about the importance of
mailing payments on time and
about what happens if they
don’t, she said. Then if students
use credit cards irresponsibly,
they can only blame themselves,
she said.

In general, the student card-
holder population performs bet-
ter than other age groups, Rullo
said.

But Susswein said she sus-
pects the parents often pay the
bill when their child gets stuck
in debt. Credit card companies
have no way of knowing
whether the money flows to
them from the child’s pocket or
from the parent’s wallet.

Whoever pays the bill, few
overlook the conveniences cred-
it cards offer to students.

Many parents want their col-
lege-aged children to carry cred-
it cards in case of an emergency
and because it’s safer than car-
rying cash, Rullo said.

“If used responsibly, it’s a
great tool to have,” she said.

Pitt sophomore Michelle

. McSwigan said her credit cards

helped pay for her tuition this
fall

The Office of Financial Aid
didn’t process her Stafford Loan
in time, so she had to pay $800
toward her tuition on her own.

Without credit, she couldn’t
have spared that much money.
Senior John Mekonis said his
credit card enabled him to pay
for $1,000 worth of emergency

repairs on his truck. He also —

uses a credit card to pay for gas
toward the end of the month
when his cash supply is low.

“If you trust yourself, then
there’s no reason you can’t
enjoy the conveniences of a
credit card,” Susswein said.

Some Pitt students don’t trust
themselves.

Molly Neff said she will not
get a credit card, because she
fears she would take advantage
of it. If she sees something at
the store that she likes, she
might use the credit card too
easily, she said.

Credit awareness

Student credit cards, the bane of college students —— at least
according to some, such as Ruth Susswein, the executive direc-
tor of BankCard Holders of America (see related news story).

' Susswein believes personal finance classes should be offered as

early as junior high and credit management seminars should be
offered in college. The Pitt News vehemently disagrees.

By the time a student reaches college, it is time to grow up
and act like a mature adult. If people are naive enough to think
that when they use credit cards that they are getting something
for free, then they deserve what they get. We have no sympathy
for students, like the one mentioned in the news article, who
signed up for more than one credit card because they wanted a
specific free gift. Fine, take your gift. More power to you. But
that does not mean you must use the card!

Furthermore, studies have shown student cardholders to be
more responsible with their credit than other age groups.
Certainly there are horror stories, but plenty of those exist for
40 year-olds as well. We are not children. College students can,
believe it or not, act responsibly. For those who cannot, what do
you want, the university and government to change your diapers
for you? ‘

Ultimately, the last thing we need are more classes designed
to help us adapt to the rigors ‘0f__“mean, old American._society,”
which would likely replace the few real academic classes
remaining in this nation’s colleges and universities. Hopefully,

-Pitt will not succumb to this nonsensical pressure, buy will

instead allow students to learn about credit cards on their own.

Single family father

The New York Times ran a story yesterday describing a recent
court ruling in Washington, D.C. on child custody. The decision
awarded custody of the children to their father, Kenneth Greene,
rather than their mother, Sharon Prost. Prost is a professional
woman whose heavy work schedule, incomparison to her for-
mer husband’s more ﬂexible hours which allow him to spend
more time with the children, was the basis for theruling. This
decision is indicative of atrend slowly gaining momentum in
the United States, as more and more fathers are winning child
custody cases. 4

The Pitt News believes this trend, which differentiates on the
basis of parental ability rather than of gender, to be a good
thing. It is helping slowly to overcome the former bias, which
tended to grant custody’ automatically to the motheriegardless
of extenuating circumstances.

This in no way implies that we feel fathers should be pre-
ferred to mothers in custody cases or that they should necessari-
ly be on an evenlevel. We do not wish to trivialize the impor-
tance of maternal nurturing. However, not all mothers are good.
nuturing parents, and when circumstances indicate that the

: father is the better parent, we strongly feel he should be granted

custody.

Columnist seeking ethnic identity

ow, don’t get me wrong,
I’m not against people
labeling ‘ themselves

“African—Americans”
“Asian—Americans” if that’s
what they want. But in my case,

7 it’s just not that easy.

I guess I could start with my
father’s side of the family. My
grandfather, my father informs
me, descended from British
immigrants. Seems simple

‘ enough, at first, until my father

then drops the little bombshell,
“Oh, yeah. He also had some
Irish ancestors, somewhere back
there.” ,

Uh—oh. Now we’re opening a
serious can of worms. What do I
call myself then? Irish and
British. Heard of oil and water
not mixing? Well, this is oil and
a lit match. So, not only does
calling myself an English-Irish-
American become unappealing
for aesthetic reasons, but it also
raises other issues. I mean, do I
now call an end to hostilities
against myself, or just keep on
fighting me? Besides, I’m pretty
sure that relatives on either of
the two isles would prefer I
choose between them. No, that
justwon’t work. ‘

or

Fine; Suppose then, I turn to
my grandmother’s side of the
family. My father’s getting that
smug look on his face again. It
appears my great—grandmother
was Canadian. But oh, no.
Couldn’t leave it at that, now
could we? She’s French-
Canadian. Quebecois. Lovely. It
also happens some over-eager

family historian tracked my

grandmother’s ancestors back to
l7th-century France.

Does that make me French-
French-Canadian-American? Or
do I combine that with my
grandfather’s side? British-Irish-
French—French—Canadian-
American? A little cumber-
some, as you can see.

Turning to my mother’s side,
things should get a bit simpler.
She was born and raised in
Spain. A—ha! I’m Hispanic-
American. (For the sake of
brevity, we’ll ignore my father
for a while. Hey, my mother
does it all the time.) 7‘

But, no. My mom can’t let
things lie, either. She’s got to
muddy the ancestral waters even
further. Ever hear that old story
about a baby left on someone’s
doorstep by poor Gypsies?

Aristide an inspiration

Believe it or not, that is pre-
cisely what happened to my
mother. She was adopted by a
Spanish couple when her Gypsy
parents could not afford to raise
her themselves. This comes as a
complete shock to me, as well.

“Didn’t I tell you about that?”
My mother asks. Hmmm, and I
thought only my father and I
had those important-discus-
sions-we-were-supposed-to-
have-but-just-didn’t-get-around-
to-it talks. (the big sex talk,
for example. Give him credit,
though; I think my father "did
try to broach the sub- ject
once, just after my divorce.)

That means I can’t even sim-
plify things and call myself a
European—American. Seems the
Gypsies began their wanderings
in Egypt, hence their name.

Hey, does that make me an
African-American?

I’ve found my own solution to
the problem of my personal
ancestry. I just smile and say,
‘‘I’m a Vulcan-American.”

The smart folks smile and
answer, “Live long and pros-
per.”

Haitian government became. During his eight

Prex has
chance
to snare
school
record .

t is amaz-
ing what

   Eric Prex,
Columnist the senior ,
Jack striker on the
Becker Pitt soccer

team, is play-
ing without the hindrance of
a cast over his left arm for
the first time since his sopho-
more year, and the change
has freed him to be a danger-
ous player once again.

Prex is on track toput up
some historical numbers at
Pitt, and the thought here is J
he’ll do it.

The school record for goals
in a career is 35, held by
none other than Prex’s coach
Joe Luxbacher. The record
has stood for 20 years, since
Luxbacher hung up his c’olle—
giate cleats. ‘

Before the season started,
Prex had accumulated 21
career goals, needing 15 to
break the all—time mark. He
scored seven goals in his
freshman year, racked up 10
as a sophomore, his best sea-
son to date, and, playing with
a cast last year, he still man-
aged to score four goals.

Pitt has 18 games on tap
for the 1994 season. Prex
would have to average just
under a goal per game in
order get a crack at it, and
few people not named
Roberto Baggio (the. Italian
striker who lit up the World
Cup) are capable of scoring
every time they take the
field.

Yet it can be done. In fact.
it’s even been done before at
Pitt. In 1955 Bob Cherry
scored a school—record 17
goals.

So far Prex is ahead of
schedule.

Through the first four
games this year, Prex is tied
for the Big East lead with
Georgetown’s ‘Raul Ferrer in
both goals scored (5) and
overall points (13).

Prex has punched in his
five tallies on only 10 shots
and has already surpassed
last season's output. What’s
more, the co-captain has
scored in all but one contest
to date and even registered a
hat trick against Buffalo.

There have been a lot of great
players who have lined up on
the offensive side of the ball in
the Big East, most of whom

rushed for over 1,000 yards.
Big East officials feel that this
year will follow the same suit.

“I think that if you look down
most of our offenses this year
you will see that a lot of it
evolves around the running
game,” Big East Assistant
Commissioner for Public
Relations, John Paquette said.
“So, I think we have a lot of
quality guys.

“To be honest with you, a
couple of guys have been hurt.
You know [Pitt’s] Curtis Martin
has been hurt. He has been a lit-
tle banged up and Robert
Walker at West Virginia has

been a little banged up. But I’

still think we have a great sta-
ble of running backs in the

league. We have a lot of quality ‘

backs.” I a

While they receive praises
from the higher officials, this
season has been a big disap-
pointment. Pitt’s Billy West is

the only running back (who q

completed two or more games)
in the conference who averages
more than 100 yards per game.
This leaves the question, why
are they doing so poorly this
year?

“I just can’t tell you why,”
Panther head coach Johnny
Majors said. “Maybe some
people are playing good
defense. But I haven’t seen
enough of the other people to
know why.

“The only reason Curtis
Martin is not one of the leaders
in the conference right now and
one of the leaders in the coun-
try is because he missed the last
two games. He missed every-
thing except for the first few
minutes of the Ohio game. He
missed all of Ohio State.”

Martin, who was projected as
a Doak Walker and All-
American candidate, was the
leading rusher in the nation
after the first game of the sea-

son. His 251 yard effort was -

good enough for Big East play-

Once considered to be a top NBA prospect, forward Willie
Cauley has been ruled academically ineligible for this season.
Cauley averaged 6.9 points and 3.6 rebounds per game last

Former Pitt basketball player
Willie Cauley, who once was
said to be destined for the
NBA, will not even finish his
career at Pitt. ,

Cauley, the 6-foot-7-inch
senior forward, has had his
basketball
scholarship

after failing
to meet
NCAA aca-
demic eligi-
b i 1 i t y
r e q u i r e -
ments and
will not play in the 1994-95
season. 5

It was announced in August
that Cauley would be sidelined
this year after injuring his
knee.

Now, Cauley is not part of
the team at all.

“We’re doing everything we
can to help him find a place to
play,” assistant coach Bobby
Jones said.“Whether that be
Division II or NAIA, we’re
looking for a place for him to

 

revoked“

play. this season. If he went to
a Division I school, he’d have
to sit out.”

Cauley came to Pitt in 1993
as a player considered to be
among the best in the junior
college ranks, but he also came
with a troubled past. At Dodge
City (Kan.)‘ Community
College, Cauley averaged 17.6
points and 8.2 rebounds per
game but was kicked off the
team after he was involved in a
shoplifting incident at a liquor
store. I ,3

Cauley then transfered to
Finger ‘Lakes Community
College, where he did not play
basketball. This summer he
served 58 days in jail for an

arrest that occured while he

was at Finger Lakes.

Last season at Pitt, Cauley
came off the bench to score 6.9
points and grabbed 3.6

rebounds per_ game.

Cauley’s absence frees up
another scholarship for next
year for Pitt coach Ralph
Willard.

“Everyone here has been
very supportive of Willie and
will continue to be,” Jones
said.

One person on Pitt’s soccer
team has created his own style
of aggressive play, a sort of
rock-and-roll soccer. That per-
son is junior midfielder Jeff
Porter.

Porter, who was given the
nickname “Nails” by a former
teammate, plays with reckless
abandon on the field. Whoever
said that soccer was a minimal
contact sport never watched
Jeff Porter play.

“I play aggressively,” Porter
said. “I don’t have great ball-
handling skills or a great open-
field game, but I am always
around the ball.”

“Jeff is very enthusiastic -—
he never gets down,” team-
mate Eric Prex said.

key to Porter's soccer success

Porter, who chose Pitt after a
successful high school career
at Penn—Trafford, has brought
a definitive style of play to the
Panthers. Through four games
this season Porter, who has
appeared in three of them, has
scored twice on six shots.

“Jeff thinks he is 6—feet—5
and 230 pounds out there
sometimes,” fellow Panther
Bob Dyer said.

“He is really fun to watch
and play on the same team
with.”

Last year, Porter was the
second—leading scorer on the
team with eight goals and two
assists for a total of 18 points.
He had a hat trick in Pitt’s 3-0
win over Marshall, and he con-
nected on three game-winning
goals.

get off to a rough start for
Porter. In a scrimmage before
the start of the season, Porter
injured his ankle and was
forced to miss the season
opener against Bucknell. He
made his return in the first half
of the game against Buffalo
and scored his first goal of the
season. Porter has started each
game since.

“I am over the injury now,
but in the beginning it was
tough,” Porter said. “The train-
ers, Tony Salesi, Bryan
Orenchuk and Christine
Battista, worked really hard
with me, and they deserve all
of the credit for getting me
back so soon.”

The Panthers were picked to
finish eighth in the preseason
Big East soccer coaches’ poll
this year. In a competitive con-
ference like the Big East, the
skills and aggressiveness of a
player like Porter show
through.

“My freshman year, we
made the Big East tournament
and-I thought that was pretty
easy, but after you have been
there you find out what a privi-
lege it was to get there,” Porter
said. “The style of play in the
Big East is definitely more
physical than in our non-con-
ference games.”

That was evident in the
Panthers’ conference opener
with Georgetown, when Pitt
was whistled for 29 fouls in
the game.

Porter’s team seems to feed
off of his aggressive style.

“Jeff brings enthusiasm and
humor to the team,” Dyer said.
“He is definitely a winner and
brings confidence to the play-
ers around him.”

“Porter keeps us on our
toes,” Prex said. “He makes
me a better player because he
gets me the ball a lot with his
aggressiveness.”

Porter’s admiration for his
teammates is obvious.

“Prex is a very unselfish
player,” Porter said. “He gets
the ball back to you after you
make a pass. He has good

er of the week. After suffering
an ankle injury all he can do is
watch from the sidelines.

Then there is West Virginia’s
Walker, who is coming off the
best single season rushing effort
(1,250 yards) in Mountaineer
history. But to the dismay of
WVU’s coaching staff, Walker
isn’t following where he left off
last year due to injuries. After
four games the junior from
Huntington, W.Va., only has a
total of 278 yards, averaging
69.5 a game.

Martin and Walker lead a
long list of disappointments for
a conference that, on paper, has
some of the best backs in the
nation.

For instance, Rutgers was
supposed to have one of the
best running tandems in Terrell

Willis and Bruce Presley.

The Scarlet Knights media
guide describes the duo as
“explosive.” Last season they
rushed for over 2,000 yards on
321 carries, averaging a com-
bined 6.24 yards a carry. Willis,
a 6-foot, 200-pound sophomore,
made a huge impact by leading
the Big East in rushing with
1,261 yards on 195 carries and
13 touchdowns. After the sea-
son, Willis, who last year shat-
tered the NCAA freshman all-
purpose yardage record (with
2,026 yards) previously held by
Georgia’s Herschel Walker, was
Sports Illustrated’s Rookie of
the Year.

After being labelled confer-
ence rookie of the year, Willis
has been struggling so far. After
three games, he has carried the
ball 47 times for 230 yards,

only averaging 76 yards an out-
ing. His teammate hasn't
picked up the slack. So far this
season, Presley has run the ball
48 times for 198 yards, good for
66 yards a game.

Things down at Virginia Tech
aren’t any better. The Hokies
claim to have their version of
“Touchdown Tommy” in
Tommy Edwards. But, for the
record, he only has two touch-
downs while carrying the ball
39 times. After three games,
“Touchdown Tommy” was only
capable of managing 119 yards
on the ground. He averages a
dismal 39.7 yards a game.

Although James Stewart
(Miami) and Dwayne Thomas
(Virginia Tech) are off to a great
start, the overall performance of
Big East ball carriers has not
lived up to its preseason hype.

Tennis

°From page 7

“It’s not like I’m killing my
opponents,” Davis said, “It just
feels good to win.”

That wasn’t the case for
Davis and Tamara Kalesnik in
doubles action.

They were defeated 6-4, 6-3
by Kelly Martin and Carey
Sisko.

“Tamara and I have a lot of
things to work out,” Davis
said.

She stressed the fact that
they “just have to get used to
playing together.”

“At this point we have a bet-
ter singles team than doubles,”
Dieffenbach said.

“The important thing about
today was we had positive
results even though we didn’t
win,” Dieffenbach said.
enbach said. _

In other singles action,
Kristin Siegel won 6-3, 6-2
over Duquesne’s Anne
Gorman while Pitt’s No. 2
player Marla Zielinski was
defeated 6-1, 6-1.

“Marla needs to work on
maintaining consistency and
not leaving a point too soon,”

‘Dieffenbach said, “She attacks

a little too early.”

The Lady Panthers look to
improve their 3-2 record
tomorrow at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania.

assist to Prex in his quest is
Pitt has the look of a Big East
contender again this year.
Additionally, Prex has some
help knocking the ball
through
the posts
from
capable
scorers
Jeff
Porter,
Dean
Astorino

 

and Todd Graf.
If Prex does set a new goal-
scoring mark, the man whose

‘mark he breaks will surely be
on the sidelines to see it hap-
pen.

Luxbacher said in the pre-
season he hopes Prex breaks
his record.

It would take a monumental
effort from Prex, because it is
doubtful he can continue at
this pace without any type of
slump, however it would be
the crowning achievement to
what has been one of the
most accomplished Pitt
careers of the 1990s.

The team, whose record
stands at 3-1, 0-1 in the Big
East Conference, is very
important to Porter.

“The team is playing well,”
Jeff said. “I think this is the
best year ever for us. We defi-
nitely are counting on making
it to the Big East tournament,
and we want to go to the
NCAA ‘championship tourna-

“Its a lot more exciting when

“At other schools like

As any true Pitt soccer fan
knows, attendance for a

1 Panther home game at Pitt sta-

dium is minimal.

The football team is drawing
fans at a clip of 30,000 a game,
while the soccer team can not
attract a crowd of over 30 peo-
ple.

Fan attendance should not be
a problem for Porter and the
other Panthers as soon as some
true soccer fans recognize that
Jeff Porter’s brand of rock-
and-roll soccer is here to stay.

There must be some way _
to avoid doing the same thing
for the next forty years.

Life’s been pretty good so far. You've
kept moving—taken all the right
steps along the way (for the most-
part). And now you’re ready for the
biggest step.

You'll be getting your degree from
a top school. You're about to find a
greatjob.

The question is: which job? And
will it have the potential to interest
you for a whole career?

You've probably heard the story of

2 the job applicant who said he was a

shoe salesman with fifteen years expe-

_ rience. “No,” corrected the recruiter

interviewing him, “you've had

six months experience thirty times."
Isn't there some way to keep

challenging yourself in new and
