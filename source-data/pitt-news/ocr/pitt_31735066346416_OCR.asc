The French author_Vercors will speak on the topic, “The
Esthetics of Revolt,” Wednesday at noon in the SU Ballroom.
The event is sponsored by the Midday Series in conjunction
with the “Alliance Francaise,” which will also present
Vercors as a speaker that evening.

Vercors, whose “Silence de la Mer” is considered a mod-

eern classic also had a Book—of-

Fraternity
Taps Eleven

Initiation ceremonies were held
Friday for 11 undergraduates and
one honorary member who were
tapped into Pi Delta Epsilon, hon-
orary journalism fraternity.

The honorary member, Daniel
assistant professor
English, was unable/to attend the
ceremonies due to illness.

Undergraduates selected from
the Owl were Glenn Graham,
business manager; Martha Hyslop,
senior editor; and David Ellen-
berger. organizations editor.

Members of the Pitt News
named to membership were Lou
Wagner, proofreader; Jim Huf-
nagel, news editor; Matthew Nes-
visky, executive editor; Jim O’-
Brien. sports editor, and Elliott
Drexler, comptroller.

Tapped from Ideas and Figures
was Bonnie Kleper, business man-
ager, Pitt Capsule representative
was Herschel Sakulsky, business
‘manager. Jim Falk, features edi-
tor of the Skyscraper Engineer,
was also tapped.

of.

the—l\/lonth Club Selection in his
novel “You Shall Know Them.”
I-Iis short stories and essays have
been acclaimed both by French-
men and Americans alike.

“Vercors should be a most wel-
come speaker on many an Amer-
ican campus,” said Konrad Bieber,
chairman of the department of
French and Italian at Connecticut
College, which is sponsoring Ver-
cors‘ tour.

Although the author was
trained as a mechanical engi-
neer, he has published albums
of drawings and etchings aswell
as illustrating children's books.
He was one of the founders of
the clandestine “Editions dc
Minuit,” which was later to pub-
lish some of his own works
among those of already aclr-A
nowledged authors.

At this time he received his
first acclaim as a writer and chose
the pseudonym Vercors because it
symbolized the spirit of resistance
against oppression. Vercors was
president of the Congress of
French Writers for four years.

After his speech there will be
a lunc.heon, attended by 12 stu-
dent, faculty, and administration
members. The luncheon will be
unique in that only French will
be spoken during the meal. There
will also be an informal coﬁee
hour in the lower lounge of the
Student Union at 3 p.m., open to
everyone. A

 

ill be used as the theme for the

Sig Chi and Thctapfront. The winner will be

afternoon. The committees ex-

pressed complaint that the judging would be
made in only one hour.

Peggy Seeger to A/ppeozr Thursday Evening

PM Series To Present Folk Singer

The University PM Series will
present Peggy Seeger, world fa-
mous folk singer, in a concert
Thursday at 8 pm. in the SU
Lounge.

Miss Seeger was born in 1935,
in New York, into the Seeger fam-

ily of folkmusic fame. Her par»- S

ents were both accomplished mu-
sicians and transcribcrs and edi-
tors of folk music.

She could play both the guitar
and piano at the age of twelve and
soon mastered the intricacies of
the ﬁve-string banjo.

While attending Radclbffe Miss
Seeger and several fellow mu-
sicians from MIT released her
ﬁrst record, Folk Songs of
Courting and Complaint.

From there she went to the
Netherlands to complete her
studies. In 1957 she attended the
World Youth Festival in Moscow,

 

PEGGY SEEGER
Folk Singer

 

where she and two others won the
international folk—music competi-
tion. -
From Moscow she traveled
through China, Poland, Ger..
many. France, and England.
where she has spent. the past

few years singing and recording
with Ewan MacColl,.‘singer and
collector of Scottish and Eng-
lish folk-music.

Her instrumental technique re-
flects her early orientation toward
the South-eastern American folk-
music tradition.

Miss Seeger's overall style is
midway between the raw material
of rural folk--song and the con-
sciously polished material of its
urban adoption.

After the concert, the PM Se-

ries will hold a coffee hour in the
SU lounge.

Anatomist

CA 9
ge Report

Dr. Albert 1. Lansing, professor
of anatomy at the University's
School of Medicine presented a
report on the comparison of the
aging processes of man and roti-
fers on WIIC, Channel 11, last
Tuesday.

Dr. Theodore B. Rosenthal, as-
sociate professor of anatomy and
)an aide in the work of Dr, Lans-
ing, stated that the reason for this
comparison of man and rotifers is
the use of a simplier organism to
provide a clue as to_ where to look
(for a certain process under
study) in more complicated or-
ganism.
‘ He said that the life span of
the rotifer, a microscopic form of
life. is from 15 to 30 days. He
further said that the rotifer dem-
onstrates “parthenogenesis,” the
biological term referring to the
hatching of eggs by females of an

organism which includes only fe-
,males in its numbers.

He further stated that, al-
though all rotifer eggs are
genetically identical, the eggs
laid by a young mother have
greater potential life span than
eggs laid late in life.

Dr. Rosenthal added that, by
collecting the rotifer eggs at dif-
ferent times and by raising them
separately, different lines with
different life spans can be culti-
vated and observed.

He said that Dr. Lansing’s
background includes a Ph.D. from
Indiana University, where the lat-
ter’s ’ doctoral dissertation con-

M cerned rotifers. He added that Dr.

p -I

iLan.sing began his work on the
aging of rotifers at Washington
University in St. Louis.

Physicist to Speak

At Science Series

Dr. Phillip Morrison, professor
of physics and nuclear studies at
Cornell University, will be the
third speaker in the University’s
Philosophy of Science Series to-
morrow and Wednesday.

The lecture, to be given both

days at 8:15 p.m. in the Clapp
_Ha1l auditorium, discusses “Cos-
mology Today."

Dr. Morrison attended Pitts-
burgh public schools, Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology, and the Uni-
versity of California, in Berkeley.

Before joining the Cornell fac-
ulty in 1946, Dr. Morrison taught
at San Francisco State College
and the University of Illinois. He
also worked at the University of
Chicago‘ Metallurgical Labora-
tory, and at the Los Alamos. New
Mexico, laboratory where the ﬁrst
test atomic bomb was detonated.

WHAT DOES AN OLD GRAD LIKE BEST ABOUT HOMECOMING? Next to shaking
hands, he likes reminiscing. About fraternity parties, girls, sorority parties, girls,
off-campus parties, girls-and, of course. about how great cigarettes used to
taste. Fortunately for you, Luckies still do taste great. (So great that college
students smoke more of them than any other regular cigarette.) Which shows
that the important things in college life stay the same. Parties. Girls. Luckies.

CHANGE TO LUCKIES and get some taste for a change!

  -Home life 

No one wants a nuclear war. Even Russian Premier

 
   

Nikita Khrushchev has admitted that. Yet last Saturday. a‘

group of university and high school students felt the neces-
psity to march through Pittsburgh reaffirming their desire
"for peace.iW_hether they realize it or not,phowever, these
organized and orderly demonstrators reverted to a psy-
chology which has played on people’s emotions alltthrough
history to induce war not prevent it. Such banners as “shel-
ters are tombs” plant a.fear in man which could easily lead
to hysteria then war.

Granted if the shelter is in the target area there’s little
hope for anyone, but in newspapers and on television. pro-
grams all over the country, the importance of bomb shel-
ters has been explained by Civil Defense workers who have
investigated their potentialities as life savers not as killers.
And being prepared for nuclear war by no means condones
its approach. Even the Boy Scouts are “always prepared.”

But too many students today underestimate their pow-
ers as any but protest or demonstration groups. How much
stronger and more solidifying isthe positive approach?

In universities. and high schools today more and more *

foreign students are attending classes in the United States.
Pitt alone has over 200 students representing various coun-
tries of the world. If students really want to do something
to ensure peace then it’s time they analyzed their relation-
ship to these students from other countries and took an ac-
tive interest in their way of life and their beliefs outside
of the classroom. I ' '

Being an individual good will ambassador hardly car-
.ries with it the excitement and activity of peace marches.
It is a slow, maturing process where an intelligent aware-
ness of what democracy actually means in practice can
build the solid international relations of tomorrow. It can
and must happen here, for it is important to remember
that all peace walkseventually lead back home.

Hands Across The Street . . .

Universi-TV

By TOM BRYANT

Let‘s start another cultural and educational ex-

change program.

Not with Venezuela or Tibet or Cambodia but
with the citizens of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
USA. Exchange programs with ‘foreign countries
are vital to the universal at-
tainment of higher education,
but the University is overlook-
ing an excellent opportunity to
share its educational‘ resources
with local citizens and simul-
taneously assist a worthwhile
educational institution.

How can a goal be accom-
plished? The answer is fairly
simple: inaugurate a co-opera-
tive program between the‘Uni-
versity and community televi-
sion station WQED.

In a converted mansion opposite the Cathedral,
one of America’s foremost educational stations
broadcasts to thousands of tri-state schools and
homes. WQED is community supported by public
contributions, not owned and operated by a college,
university, or local board of education as are many
other educational stations.

Stimulating Tool

Here at the very center of the University cam-
pus, a tool for stimulating higher education among
area residents lies seemingly ignored by the stu-
dents and administration. The William Pitt Debat-
ing Union’s “Face The People”, Doc Carlson’s
weekly “Pitt Huddle”, and even the highly—rated
analysis of Panther football games have vanished
from the WQED schedules. Newspapers occasional-
ly print notices of University instructors appearing
on channel 13 telecasts or of students performing
on Friday night dramas, but such notices are few
and far between.

An exchange program would enable WQED pro-
gramming to beneﬁt from cultural and educational
resources otherwise unavailable. By granting the
University 30-60 minutes each week for a series of
telecasts, WQED would strengthen its current drive
for upgradad programming quality and prestige

Television network and assist the University in ore...  t

University dramatic organizations could
valuable theatrical experience presenting their pro-

ductions on television following the close oftheirl 

regular runs. Financial reward for performers
would be improbable but what aspiring young actor

wouldn’t jump at the chance to display his talents’. PC

on televisi.on.? The Pittsburgh area is unaware of

the University‘s excellent musical and dramatic tal. '

ent that gains little more than campus recognition
-—an occasional TV “Special” would correct this
dilemma. ' I
Rel-urn Hie Popular .

In addition to frequent musical and dramatic
presentations, a return of the popular “Face The
People” format, in which a studentpanel inter-
viewed prominent local ofﬁcials, residents and visi-
tors could be integrated into the programming.
News .of University activities, scientiﬁc and medi-
cal research analyses and student discussions could
also be incorporated into the series.

Channel 13 carries many programs video—taped
by colleges and universities hundreds of miles dis-
tant, yet is neglected by the school—house across the
street. The implication is not that the University
should grant unlimited funds to the station, even
‘though assitance in production of a series of Uni-
versity-sponsored telecasts would beneﬁt WQED in
terms of prestige and diversified schedules, and
the University in terms of good public relations, as
W911 35’ genelﬂlly bettering the education of the
community.

In an age when many consider the’Univei'sit.y
anything but a “knight in shing armor,” an ex-
Change program with WQED would convince Pitts-
burghers that the University is not just a big busi-.-
ness devoted to swallowing the entire Western
Pennsylvania area, but is dedicated to providing
the finest in higher education and that WQED is
fulﬁlling its purpose in stimulating, educating and
frequently entellainiflg the cultural minds of the
community. '

Student Lawyers Represent
 Law School At Mock Court

Three student lawyers last week
represented the University in the
regional rounds of the 1961 Na-
tional
held here in Pittsburgh.

The competition enables out-
standing student: lawyers from
New Jersey and Pennsylvania to
argue a realistic US. Supreme
Court Case before a jury of qual-
iﬁed judges.

The representatives from the
University‘s School of Law were
Gene E. Arnold, Robert B.
Bowytz, and Robert A. Leboyitz.
All three law students are sen-
iors.

Top Students Compete

Ten two and three men teams
competed in the three day com-
petition. Top law students from
Dickinson, Penn, Rutgers, Seton
Hall, Temple, Duquesne, and the
University argued the case both
in oral and written fashion.

The two winning teams will
go on to national moot court
competition next month in New

York. More than 100 teams

Moot Court Competition-

from throughout the U.S. are
entered in 15 different regional
rounds.

This is the first time the Penn-

competition have been held in
Pittsburgh. The annual competi-
tion is sponsored nationally by
the Association of the Bar of the
City of New York.

Sponsored by Bar

The Pittsburgh regional was
sponsored by the Allegheny Coun-
ty Bar Association through its
Junior Bar Section.

The school winning the oral

arguments will receive a silver
bowl award from the American
College of Trial Lawyers.

tition is designed to give student
«lawyers practice in arguing before
courts of appeal. The judges de-

POVERTY CAN BE FUN

It is no (lisgmce to be poor. It is an error, but it is no (lisgjrace.

So if your purse is empty, do not skulk and brood and hide
your head in slimne. {\‘t.and tall. Admit your poverty. Admit» it
free.l_v and lrzmkly and all kinds of good things will happen. to
you. Take, for instance, the case of Blos:-mu .\‘ig‘;1l'oos.

Blossom, an impecunious freslunzm at an lﬂ}:l.ste1‘11 girls’
college, was smart as a whipland round as a dumpling, and
s<‘-.a1'<-ely a day went by when she didn’t get invitved to a party
weekend at one of the nearby men'.s schools. But Blo.~s(>n1 never
accepted. She did not have the rail fare; she (lid not have the
clothes. VVE-ekend after weekend, while her classnwzltes went
frolicking, Blossom) sat alone, saved from utter despair only
by her pack of l\la.rlhoros, for even an exchequer as slim as
Bloss<;>m’s can Alford the joys of l.\larlboro-—joys far beyond
their paltry price: rich, mellow tolmccos, lo\'in;:,'l_v cured and

“It Goes On..."

SINGING IN THE RAIN .

Most of our musical vocabulary is Italian, whether a sonata or
concerto, an allegro, andante or adagio. The Italians have given the
world, a continuous stream of great music: Monteverdi, Palestrina,
Vivaldi, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini are names immortal in music
history.

Add Angelo Dabiero and John Yaccino to the list. On Saturday
“Pappa” Dabiero, a tiny gent who wore a blue alpine hat with a
golden feather, and I were searching for his scatback son, Angie,
when we both heard a frolicsome melody roll forth from the steam-
ing shower room. ‘iThatsa my boy, Angie,” “Pappa” Dabiero roared,
his teeth spreading towards his bronze ears.

The Pitt dressing room was also an opera house. although not
as sweet-smelling as Milan’s “La Scala," as Johnny Yaccino whistled
merrily in the public baths. Dabiero had a right to be singing, Yac-
cino should have been mum.

Yaccino, whose ﬁngers proved nimble enough to win the
school jacks championship during the off-season against a comely
coed, couldn’t hold on to the football which had no protruding
prongs, and was the goat of the game for the third time this
season--this may be a record.

He took one kick-off in the endzone, seven yards deep and raced
tout with visions of Jon Arnett dancing in his head, and promptly
coughed the ball up on the twelve—yard line. From which point, Notre
Dame promptly scored its third touchdown.

Yaccino also had several passes completed in his defensive area,
oneca 59—y*arder to Les ‘Traver, and another, a 40-yarder to Traver to
set up the second score. “I called the play myself,” Traver admitted
in the dressing room, “because I knew I could beat their safetyman.

“Both times that I beat him (Yaccino), he seemed to know what
Was coming. Once he dove and he didn't even know where the ball
was and he hit me in the back of the legs.” I

Notre Dame's coach, Joe Kuharich, said, “We thought we
could beat him, we were just hopin' that we could get the "ball
to him (Traver).”

Dick Haley, a slight-looking alumnus of Pitt’s football team
who starred for the Steelers a week ago, said, “It was like squirming
on a bench, watching from the stands. I was watchin’ those kids--the
soph0m0res———makin’ those mistakes.

“But that Yaccino———he’s no kid-—was watchin' those qharterbacks
too much. He would try to study the quarterback to see what he
would do, and meanwhile his man was chatching up to him and blow-
ling right on by. He’s not fastenough to react that late.”

Lee Bernhardi, the end who caught the game-winning pass
for the Washington Huskies earlier in the year, said then, “He
(Yaccino) couldn’t have been slower than me. but I just know
I was behind him, and thergoal line.”

Yaccino’s inditfeifencc isn‘t rare on the Pitt team, according to
one of the players who really gives when he’s in the game. “I should
be hollerin' at them,” he said, “but I have enough trouble breathin’
out there. (Pete) Billey hollers himself hoarse, and it doesn't do any
good. Too many guys don’t care. Look at Yaccino, he whistles.

(Read “Why We Lose” in the Wednesday issue.)

 

—Tom Brown (60), Panther middle-linebacker,
breaks through the Notre Dame line, setting to tackle an Irish ball-
carrier. Brown made more tackles than anyone else for the fourth
time this year. Brown is only a junior.

Fails As Rush

Gets Traficant

By JIM O’BRIEN
Sports Editor

Quarterback Jim Traﬁcant
enhanced his minus yardage

utes of play on Saturday, eat-
ing the ball three consecutive
times as the inexorable clock
ticked away and the inexorable
Notre Dame line flicked away —-
most of the Panther’s would-be
blockers», as the Irish refused to
play dead for the fourth straight
year, winning 26-20.

Les Traver, who spent the
afternoon looking over his shoul-
der at defensive halfback John
Yaccino, also led the charge on

ing moments of play. “I was sure
happy to see that boy (Traﬁcant)
on his back,” Traver said with a
smirk. “Somebody was bound to
break open soon enough, and I'm
glad it was their line.”

Notre Dame’s co-captain,
coon-eyed Norb Roy,
“It’s been a long time; they’ve
been tanning our hides for a long
time. They were sure tough
their record doesn’t show it."

Partner in Crime

Roy's compatriot in crime, Nick
Bouniconti, who was limping oﬁ‘
and on the ﬁeld all day, deter-
mined to play his part in the
sweet revenge killing, said, “We
have been after them for a long
time. Our guys were really up for
the game.

“We knew it was either do or
die,” he remarked about the
hectic scare which the Panthers »
threw into the hearts of Irish
fans late in the game. “They’re
the second best team that we’ve
played. Michigan State beat us,
but Purdue had the“ better
team.”

(Purdue beat Michigan State
7-6 on Saturday.)

Waslo To IC4A

Once again, Pitt will not be
entering a full team in the up-
coming IC4A cross-country cham-
pionship meet to be held on No-
vember 20 at New York‘s Van
Cortlandt Park course.

According to Coach Carl Rees,
Steve Waslo appears to be the
lone panther harrier « with a
chance to do well in the contest.
The Jungle Cats’ mediocre sea-
son’s ledger of three victories and
five setbacks does not warrant
taking a complete squad to the
big race.

“I’m undecided about some of
the other runners,” explained
Rees, “but we’ll probably only
take Waslo. In addition, we’ll de-
ﬁnitely enter John Bailey and
Ralph Basinski in the freshman
event, and we might even add a
couple of other frosh.”

Sat.urda.y, as the Pitt hooters turn-
out back a strong Lock ‘Haven
teani by a 5-3 score.

In an effort to get more punch
into the offense, Coach Bemis
moved Ray Tarasi, a halfback,
into the center forward slot. Ta-
rasi made the mentor look like a
master strategist, as he hammered
four goals into the enemy nets to
snarl<: the Panther’s victory. ’

Lock Haven took an early lead-
when Don lVIcEntire, their fine in-’

side left, tallied in the first period.
Because of Pitt’s inability to score,

the Lock Haven squad carried a-

1-0 advantage into the second half.

The Panther offense came to life
in the third period when Tarasi

scored. two goals, with assists from
Paul Liberati and Sam Donatelli.
Nevertheless, Lock Haven re-
mained in front, as Orwig and
Koehler countered for them.

The Jungle Cats ﬁnally
evened the score when Liberati
tallied on a penalty kick. The

Sixty Attend Second
SIG-Freshman Meeting

By JACK] KATZ
Approximately 60 freshmen attended the second SG-
Freshman class meeting Thursday in the Student Union

ballroom.

Student Government president Richard Sobota, vice
president pro—tem Jay Fingeret, and freshmen representatives
Ralph Kassouf and Claude Lair explained the workings of

SG to the class. Q

. Sobota explained the purpose of
SC} andof the freshmen meetings.
He stated that it was he inten-
tion of SG to acquaint the fresh-
men with their repre_se.ntatives
because “SG has been lacking in
some deﬁnite means of communi-
cation with the freshmen.”

In explaining the purpose of
SG. Sobota said that the organi-
zation is concerned with the gen-
eral student welt‘are and that he
felt it could therefore study any
problems concerning students.

Urged to Attend

In his speech. Fingeret urged"
the class to attend the senate
meetings which are held every

p.m. He also explained SC} elec-
tions.

Following these speeches, the
meeting was opened to student
questions.

The freshmen brought up the
problems of class disunity, SG
elections, and communications
between the student body and
government.

Replying to the question on
class disunity in SG, Fingeret
said “The order of representing
students is based on the semes-
ter system; it was not changed
when we entered the trimester
system. One suggestion has beeni
to have the various schools, rather 3
than the classes. elect students but
no solution has been reached as
yet.”

Freshmen Help SG

The freshmen suggested that
the class would have more inter-
est in SG if it were introduced
to them during orientation week
and Pat Teeters explained" “We

representative speak to the class,‘

chance.”

On the subject of alcohol So-
bota stated that the only con-
cern was not just how soon al-
coholic beverages can be had on
campus, but when and where
they would be served.

When asked how the freshmen
could help SG, Finger-et replied,
“Whether you know it or not
you’re helping SG now by help-
ing us fulfill our duty to com-
municate to you.”

Need .4 lab ? I

The "lfreshmen also noted that
there is only one first trimester
freshman on SG. Claude Lair told
the class that there would soon
be committees open to the fresh-
men.

Ralph Kassouf asked the class
if they would like to continue
meeting. Everyone answered yes
and they decided to have either
monthly or bi-monthly meetings.
