Critic, First-Nrighters
Approve ‘Trailer Ho!’

Reviewer Likes Dialogues,
Settings, Dancing, Notes
First Night Slips

By ROBERT X. GRAHAM

Shakespeare would have liked
“Trailer Ho!” The current Cap
and Gown Club show, which
opened at the Nixon Monday
night for a week’s run, would
have pleased the Punster of
Avon. For, aren’t some of the
puns shall we say “dangerously,”
close to his? Isn’t the humor as
masculine, as rambunctious as
his? And aren’t the female parts
played by men?

But Shakespeare’s approval or not,
your critic and the ﬁrst-niglit audi-
ence enjoyed the show, the dance
routines, the costumes, the clever
sets, the music, the dialogue, the
lyrics, the printed pro'grams, the
Panther souvenir editions, the 1nake-
up, the lighting eflects—the entire
Trailer Ho-I-Io.

Comparison . . . _

Comparisons may be odious, but
“Trailer Ho!” knocks las't year’s ex-
travaganza “Out for the Count.” The
deft hand of Mr. Carl Cass is notice-
able in the dialogue, the deft toe of
Mr. Gene Kelly is apparent in the
dance routines, the cleft ear a11d
tongue of Mr. 'I‘hcodore M. Finney
are obvious in ‘the singiiig, the deft
paint brush and hammer of the Pitt
I--‘layers’ technical staff are in evi-
dence, and the deft needle and thread
and front-room-heating stove dress-
maker’s dummy must have ﬁgured in
the costume creations of Mrs. Algeo
and Dr. Bran'tlinger.

Oh, yes, the show was written by
G. Norman Reis, Pitt ’16, but then
that’s 11ot news any more.

-It is true that Ben Baskin of the
men’s chorus kept looking up ‘to the
second balcony as if he had lost a
hat there some time last winter; that
Sidney Shore’s red-stockinged long
legs added sharps to the orchestra
naturals; that Charles Custer’s tennis
ensemble was almost stopped by the
censors; that Robert Saffron had to
soap-box ad lib a bit until Nick
Spanos woke to his ranting; and Jack
Hoeveler‘s “mike” was dead until
engineers Woke up.

“\Vithout ‘a. Hitch"

Aside from these temporary ex-
hibits of temperament, the show went
off without, as the saying goes, a
hitch, although one or two chorus
girls were noticed adjusting their
bustles.

From Dr. S't. Clair’s drug empor-
ium hard by Pumpernickle Univer-
sity to a Western trailer camp and
back to the modernistic back room
of the ﬁrst—act pharmacy Al Barr and
Leo Caﬁ’erty, John Worry and Robert
Graf, William Murray and Milton
Hoffman, Floyd Nicklas and Thomas
Smith, and some 60 other members
of the troupe twist and squirm and
prance their way through gag after
gag, relieved, shall we say, by spe-
cialty acts, keeping the audience in
constant laughter both with and at
the actors.

Excellent casting of leading roles,
the usual attempt to pour piano-leg
knees into sleeky gowns, outstanding
song numbers, exceptional settings
and props, a profusion of good jokes,
and a speedy and spontaneous pre-
sentation as if members of the cas't
actually enjoyed going through their
gyrations added considerably to the
audience’s appreciation of the musi-
cal comedy.

Finales for all three acts were col-
orful and effective. Perhaps no other
Cap and Gown show has ever had

Le Roy Osterman, BA37, Will Receive Diploma Ingjune
After Seven Years Of Employment, Part Time
Sessions_Of Undergraduate Class Study

By REGGIE STRAR

“College work has been a hobby,”
says LeRoy Osterman, BA37. And
that’s why he hasn’t minded waiting
seven years for the diploma which he
will receive on commencement day,
June 9.

Since 1932, when he began work
in the Registrar’s office, he has prob-
ably dispensed more diplomas him-
self, to people who called for them at
the office, than any other person
aside from the Chancellor.

Roy, as he is generally known, is
the tall blond lad who has borne much
of the routine registration work in
the past several years. He has be-
come somewhat of a standby at semi-
annual and summer registrations, -and
when he's around, the boss knows
things are running smoothly.

Through all the confusion of hun-
dreds of worried students looking for
class cards or in the dull monotony

of office work, Roy’s incomparable,
“Perk up boy, perk up!” has cheered
many of his fellow Workers through
a tiresome afternoon.

Roy entered the University in 1930,
working in the bookstore, taking only
a few evening credits in the Down-
town division. After a while he trans-
ferred his work to the dean of men’s
office then located in the activities
building, the old Y-Hut. In 1932 he
joined the Registrar's staff.

After two years of work and study
he had only 16 academic credits to--
wards graduation, and at the end of
three years he was still a freshman.

It was then that Roy began to take
more credits, completing the required
64 credits in the School of Business
Administration and majoring in So-
ciology, a College course.

During the school year 1935-36 he
took 13 credits per semester in the

Ofﬁall Ducats,

Reports Rauck

Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and
seniors-——al1 and sundry may go to
the Senior Ball. Refusing to stoop to
the limitation advertising stunt to
draw a crowd to their class afl’air,
the seniors have announced that their
dance will be open.

Chairman W. Gordon Rauck, C, is
confident that no such subterfuge will
be necessary to attract attention and
sell tickets to “the social event of
the season.”

Although the Ball will be open to
all students on campus, the theme of
the affair, and in fact the dance it-
self will center around the seniors
and graduation, and is to be espe-
cially for the graduating students.

Bob Clayman and his band have
been signed to play in theballroiom
of the Twentieth Century Club from
10 to 2 o’clock, the 21st of this
month. ,

C-layman since his most successful
sea"ton at the Roosevelt Hotel has
been l)8.l‘}.1.'lt‘O1‘llll1lg' the surrounding
territory on one night stands.

According to Rauck, there has been
a change in the committee line-up
since the announcement published
last week. John Gleason, EA, will re-
place Bill McQuade, E, as chairman
of the decorations committee, and the
name of Al Vallisch, E, has been
added to those who will decorate the
ballroom.

The decorations as well as the fa-
vors and programs will be strictly in
keeping with the graduation theme.

Keys To Be Awarded

May 17 and the Hotel Schcnley

David Racusin, BA37, chairman of
the banquet committee and business
manager of The Nex

Attended each year by all the
members of student publications at
the University, the banquet this year,
as in previous years, will feature
some well-known newspaper man or
woman as the main speaker. At this
affair each year are also awarded
gold and silver keys for those staff
members who have rendered meritori-
ous service on their respective pub-
lications.

At the present time. several promi-
nent journalists have been contacted
to speak, according to James Dono-
ghue, C38, in charge of the program,
but no definite word has been re-
ceived up to the present time.

To A d d re s s

“Human versus Animal Society”
will be the subject of a talk to be
given by Dr. Samuel H. Williams,
professor of biology and associate di-
rector of the University’s Lake Labo-
ratories, at the second meeting of
SFA’s Studen-t-Fa-culty Forum.

The program is scheduled for 12 :30
to 2 o’clock in.-Room‘--208, Cathedral,
Friday. Dr. Williams will devote ap-
proximately half’ of the” time alloted
to a discussion of his subject, and will
lead an open forum for",tl1e remainder
of the program. 

According to Dr. Williams, the dis-
cussion will deal largely». with the abil-
ity of human society to solve its prob-
lems as compared to [that of society
in the animal world. Much of the ma-
terial in his discussion; will be the
result of his experiments and expedi-
tions throughout the world, as well as
personal investigation into the prob-
lem. . - 

Dr. Williams’ most 1'ege11t work has
been his biology 'text’f“Tl1e Living
World,” which was issued last March.
The volume has" beenaccepted by
biology departments in universities
throughout the country as a text in
ecology, ﬁeld zoology,’ and nature
study.

Introduced by Dr. William T. Root,
professor of psychology and head of
the graduate school, two weeks ago,

man, C39, chairman, “plans to in-

To Aw a r d
, ‘Distinction’

College Graduates Will Get
-New Honors Notations
.' At’ Cornrnencement

_.._——..;.—

Seniors in the College will be able
to graduate “with distinction” now.
A new set of honors will be awarded
at commencement this year.

The collegehas decided to honor
students who have shown outstanding
abilities in one ﬁeld by voting them
the privilege of graduating “with dis-
tinction in .” The name of
the department is to be added in the
blank.

This does not mean the end of the
old system of honors for grade stand-
iiigs,‘ that is, honor, high honor, and
liighest-honor. Rather these new hon-
ors cover'a'diﬁ'erent ﬁeld of endeavor.

"It isintended, most of all,” accord-

*ing to Dr. A. G. Worthing, head of
' the physics department hnd chairman

of’ the honors committee, “to reward
a high order of ability in a particular
field combined with a will to do, as
preached repeatedly in the classroom,
as against the policy of the faithful
daily performance of excellent work
in all fields.”

Thus it is the intention of the new
honors to foster a11d reward outstand-
ing ability in one ﬁeld regardless of
standing in the other courses.

Can Get Both

“Of course,” as Dr. Wo1'thing
poin'ts out-,. “many of those who will
graduate ‘with distinction’ will also be
awarded general honors, but this will
not be generally ‘true. There are
those who were 11ot honored for grade
standingsnn the past, but who un-
doubtedly‘ would have been graduated
with the new honors had such been

- offered.

“It is hoped,” Dr. Worthing contin-
ues, “that, among other things, this
new procedure will open the road to
honors for those, who for one reason
or another, do not continue the liigh
average scliolar.-ship that they may
have had in their curly college years,
and for those who will not shun
‘tough courses’ and pick only the
‘snap’ ones, in order not ‘to affect their
chances for honors.”

The ‘new honors will be given to
from .three.to ﬁve per cent of the
graduating class. The exactnumber
will be determined by the honors com-
mittee. It is expected that between
six and tenwill receive such honors
at the coming graduation. ,

-The department will nominate the
candidate, and the college faculty will
vote on the proposed honors recipient.
This method was chosen from several
others by the College faculty recently
in apoll conducted by the committee.

No other school at the U11ive1'sity
ofl’ers such honors, but other institu-
tions in the country have done so for
some time, with excellent results.

Lingnan Secretary
To Speak Sunday
AtPeace Session

"Olin D. Wannamak'er', secretary of
the board of trustees of Lingnan Uni-
versity, Lingnan, China, will speak
Sunday at a meeting sponsored by
the Pitt Peace Council "in Heinz
House. I

The meeting will begin at 5
o’clock, and continue until 7:30 or 8
o’clock. Mr. Wannamaker will first
speak on the subject, “The Educa-
tion Movement in China Today.”

Students present will then discuss
the work of the Peace Council thus
far, its accomplishments and short-
comings, and map out a program for
future action. ,Refreshments will be
served to close the session.

Purpose of Sunday’s meeting, ac-
cording, to John Fritzmeier, C39,
chairman of the Peace Council, is to
get University students interested in
the exchange of cultures with other
lands. At present, the -University
maintains a student and faculty ex-
change with only one foreign school,
Lin gnan, where, this year, John Baker,
is studying through provisions of a

scholarship.

Patterns At

Speaking on “What ‘Social Traits
Are Innate” at the Psychology Forum
Monday, Dr. J. Stanley; Gray, assist-
ant professor of psychology, empha-
sized the geneticists theory in regard
to behavior patterns. '

Instincts, racial supcriorities, and
the ownership motive are no't inexor-
able laws, Dr. Gray said. He added
that “heredity and environment are
so intertwined that no basis for be-
havior patterns can be formed.”

Dr. Gray divided the subject into
‘three phases: the first, “are instincts
native behavior patterns?”; second,
“are racial superlorities inherited?,”
and last, “is the ownership motive in-
herited or due to environment?”

Heredity and environment, accord-

ing to Dr. Gray, are amalgamated a't
_birth in the gene explanation of her-
edity. No organism‘ ever developed
without the influe_nce of environment.
He further added that‘ as yet there
are no proofs that differences are in-
nate in the germ plasm. ‘
There arefour factors in racial
superiority which are due to environ-
mental‘difi"erences. According to Dr.
Gray they are amount of schooling,
method of schooling, cultural’ back-
ground, and social and economic
status. ‘ _
“Among primitive people,‘ ~ social
honor is bestowed for gen~erosi'ty
rather than for acquisitiveness,” ‘ex-
plained Dr. Gray in commenting on,
the ownership motive. ‘ .

Registrar’s Assistant Gets
Diploma After Seven
Years Of Work

(Continued from Page One)
Evening Division, ﬁve more than the
usual schedule, working daily seven
hours in the Registrar's office at the
time. Last summer, his third summer
to study and work, he took eight more
credits.

Despite the large number of hours
he works, Roy has consistently made
“A” and “B” grades through his
seven years of work and study and
has maintained a “B” average during
that time.

“Sociology is a great aid to busi-
ness,” says Roy who wants to do gov-
ernment work and feels that the sub-
ject will be of use to him in that ﬁeld,
too.

Aside from. his work in sociology,
his favorite subject is advertising. By
doing a research paper on the sub-
ject, he attracted the interest of sev-
eral ﬁrms that complimented his work-
and gave him encouragement for fu-
ture work in the ﬁeld.

Being a bi-t versatile, Roy also does
well in salesmanship and English. One
of his avocations is short story writ-
ing which he does at times “just for
the fun of writing.”

For diversion and ex-ercise, Roy
ﬁnds time to play mushball every
summer for the “Registrar's All
Stars” team which usually squares off
in a series with the “Post Office
Prunes,” and he does a good job
there, too, pitching orat an inﬁeld
spot.

Roy hasn’t any deﬁnite plans for
after June 9, but he intends to do
graduate work in either advertising
or sociology.

French Courses
Enlarge Modern
Language School

Three new courses will be added to
the language curriculum of the Uni-
versity, according to an announcement
made Friday by Dr. Whitford Shelton,
professor of modern languages.

Two of the courses will be in the
French department, while the third is
to be in the modern languages group.
The third course will be called “Mas-
terpieces of Modern Europe” and will
be taught by M. A. DeVitis, associate
professor of modern languages.

French R3, R4, the ﬁrst of the two
French courses, is intended primarily
for social science majors, according to
Dr. Shelton, but it is open to any stu-
dent desiring speciﬁc training for
reading.

The course, a three-credit one, will
cover a history of French civilization,
including political and social history,
literature, arts, industries, and the
progress of science. French C7, C8,
the second course, two credits, will
aim at developing a speaking knowl-
edge of French.

The “Masterpieces of Modern Eu-
rope” course which Mr. DeVitis is to
teach will be a two credit course. It
will cover French literature. Admis-
sion to this course is limited to juniors
and seniors, but no previous French
training is required.

University
Staff Men
Study Dust

Silicosis Subject of Article
Published In Magazine
After Researches

Three members of the University
staff who have made studies of dif-
ferent phases of industrial dusts and
dep wsits in the human lung tissue col-
laborute in an article in the current
issue of the Journal of Industrial Hy-
giene and Toxicology.

Dr. Victor Hicks, in charge of the
cooperative X-ra_v laboratory at the
University; Olive McElroy, biological
chemist in the Mellon Institute; and
Mary E. Warga, lecturer in physics,
are the authors of an article which
shows three different methods of
study; X—ray difl’ract-ion, chemical,
and spectrographic.

Obstacle Encountered

Indicating that the chief obstacle
to the study of various pneumoconi-
oses (silicosis, from quartz dust;
siderosis, from iron oxide; asbestosis,
from asbestos, etc.) has been the dif-
ﬁculty of determining the exact na-
ture of materials found in lung tis-
sue, the three scientists review the
various methods employed in the past,
and then show results of their meth-
ods as applied to a study of pneumo-
coniosis in the Pittsburgh district.

Some results explained in the arti-
cle are that conventional chemical or
spectroscopic methods of analysis
yield quantitative results, but do not
permit the distinction between free
and combined silica in lung tissue;
and that any one of the three meth-
ods is insufficient.

The summary of the research
shows that in such studies of pneumo-
conioses it is desirable to have infor-
mation concerning not only the ele-
ments present in dusts and deposits
in lungs, but also the state of chemi-
cal combination of those elements.
Such information may be obtained,
the three scientists show, by a com-
bination of spectrographic and X—ray
diffraction analyses.

   
   
    
   
  
   
   

   

   
 
  
 
   
  
   
 
 

DEEP IN THE JUNGLE FASTNES5 of Central
America amid the ruins of a lost city
Lawrence T. K. Griswold {right} has headed
expeditions to Tibet, Komodo, the Amazon,
and the lost cities of the ancient Mayas. He
lists Camels as one of the necessities on the
trail. "At best, eating in the jungle is no
picnic,”
smoking Camels is an aid to my digestion.
Camels ease tension and give me a ‘lift’ in
energy when I need it most."

HE delightful effect of smoking Camels with your

meals and afterwards has been proved again and
again in the great laboratory of human experience.
Explorers, champion athletes, people in hazardous out-
door work, as well as millions of men and women in
homes and offices, ﬁnd that Camels get digestion off to a
good start and make the perfect ending to a meal.When
you enjoy Camels, you are rewarded with an increased
flow of digestive ﬂuids—alkaline digestive ﬂuids——so
important to good digestion. And you can enjoy Camels
as often as you like! Camels don’t get on your nerves.

Hagan Cho;:11 New
Director Of Athletics

A4

Ex-Varsity Halfback Moves
Up From Graduate Spot,
Replaces Harrison

James A.,Hagan, C28, was elected
Director of Athletics at the Univer-
sity Monday morning in a meeting
of the Athletic Council at the Du-
quesne Club, according to C. D. Wet-
tach, chairman of the council.

Hagan will succeed W. ‘Don Har-
1‘i.~.on, former member of the English
department and Dean of Men, who
was the director of the athletic ad-
ministration since 1928.

Finding his way of doing things in
coiiﬁict with the policies of Dr. John
Sutherland, head football coach, Har-
ri:-‘on submitted his resignation to the

thletic Council in late March. It was
reluctantly accepted by that group on
Saturday, March 20.

Played Halfhack

Jimmy Hagan has ‘been graduate
manager of athletics ‘since his gradu-
ation froni the University in 1928.
For three of his undergraduate years
he was halfback on the varsity foot-
ball team.

Playing left half in the backﬁeld that
included Gibby Welch, bi'illiaii‘t ball
carrier, Hagan did not_ come in for
the publicity with which his more
newsworthy colleague was showered.
Hagaii’s worthiness and his value as
a team player were best exhibited
when, at the completion of his grid-
iron career, he was retained in an
executive capacity.

Hagan as a ball player was the
‘team’s best blocker. He was the man
who cut down the opposition, clear-
ing the way for Welch’s spectacular
jaunts. From this halfback position
Hagan completed a quarterback func-
tion, calling the plays.

In his service as graduate manager
Hagan has been the force that insti-
tuted golf as a sport at the University
and which is bringing the golf team
up to the place where it is certain
to receive national recognition.

The experience that Hagan has re-
ceived in this position makes him the
logical man for the Job. Hagan s
appointment comes as no surprise. It
has been in the wind for weeks.

KAPhis, Dents
Win At M ushball

Independent Season Opened
With Schedules Listed

 

Kappa Alpha Phi defeated the
Wolves 19-7 in the Independent
league and the Dents outbatted ‘the
Legal Softies 9-4 in the University
league to start the ball 1'olling in
Martin J. Feely’s Intramural mush-
ball program Monday night.

The Engineering league opener be-
tween the ME’s and the IE’s, which
was scheduled for Monday also, was
postponed and will be played at a
later date.

The KAPhi-Wolves game was a
free-hitting affair. Leese, on the
mound for the Greeks, gave up nine
hits while his teammates were getting
to Stuart for 16 safeties. The con-
test was fairly close going into the
ﬁnal inning but the KAPhis rang up
nine runs in the last frame to ‘turn
the game into a rout.

Ginsberg’s ﬁne pitching featured
the Dent—Legal Softies battle. The
Dents hopped off to an early lead
and coasted in behind ‘their twirler’s
four-run pitching.

While the schedule for the frater-
nity league games has not been begun
as yet, Feely has divided all the in-
dependent entries into three circuits.
The winner of each division will
qualify for.the All-University play-
offs which will be held immediately
after the regular schedules have been
run off.

lL.aRue Becomes
Head Coach
At Shadyside

-?£a!.¢:-

FLASHY. SENIOR HALFBACK, whose appointment as head coach at
Shadyside Academy was conﬁrmed by authorities at that school yes-
terday afternoon. LaRue is the third Panther in succession to hold a
coaching position at swanky, athletically powerful Shadyside. First was
Ken Ormiston, who was replaced by Johnny Wood this winter. Wood was
willingly released from his contract when he was offered a position at

Harvard, and now LaRue steps in.

Golf Team
Goes East
For Games

Pitt’s six golfers will take an un-
defeated record into stiff competition
Friday and Saturday in Washington
when they step out against three
‘teams which beat them last year.

Playing at Kenwood Country Club
in the city of the Cherry Blossoms,
Pitt will compete against Georgetown,
Princeton, and the University of
Pennsylvania. The three matches will
be the ﬁrst in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate conference.

Last year Pitt's men had an other-
wise successful season marred by dis-
mal showings against the three teams
they meet this week-end. However,
in each of the matches, Frank Sou-
chak, number one man this year,
managed to bring home a victory.

Top Men Have Trouble

In each of the three matches Pitt
has played so far, Souchak and Bill
Daddio, the number 2 man, have had
trouble. Spring football practice has
slowed their golf sessions up, but
with both of the football-golfers
spending several hours daily this
Week warming up, i't is expected they
will be in form for the conference
matches.

Thus far this year Pitt has played
three matches and won three. They
defeated Duquesne in the opening
links session, 9-0. West Virginia fell
by the same score, and Carnegie
Tech last Saturday go't an 8-1 conso-
lation defeat. In this match, Tech’s
lone score came as the result of dark-
ness, which prevented the play-off of
a tie between Ed Lawry and Art
Bailey.

Frank Bonarotti, playing at num-
ber 3, has been ‘turning in ﬁne scores
for the golfers. In number 4 is Tony
Kay, and number 5 is Bob Baugh—
man. Number 6 man is Ed Lawry,
sophomore basketball man, and
brother of Tim Lawry, who played
basketball for Pitt not long ago.

Grid Clinic
To Educate
Spectators

Dr. John B. Sutherland, professor
of Pitt football, will conduct a session
in “football appreciation” on Saturday
afternoon, beginning at 2 o’clock at
the Stadium. This clinic replaces the
annual meeting for high school
coaches that has been held for the
past three years.

Open to the general public at no

tract close to a stadium full of stu-
dents. It will treat thoroughly with
the intricate workings of a gridiroii
macliiiie. '

Stepping ‘through the plays in a
slow motion tempo to the accompani-
ment of a public address, Dr. Suther-
land’.-s illustration will be the members
of the varsity football team who will
oﬁficially end their spring drills with
‘this exhibition.

Intricacies Revealed

Each step will be outlined, the part
that each man plays in the execution
of each play, and the intricacies of
the Pitt systeni will be revealed in a
popular manner.

The nature of practice sessions
and the reasons for each piece of
strategy are included in the text of
Dr. Sutlierland’s lecture. Assisting
the coach will be his full staff of
aides and the varsity team.

According to Dr. Sutherland, this
type of forum is very necessary in
this day of gridiron coinplexity. Each
year adds another intricacy to the
football systems of the iiation’s lead-
ing schools. This is almost as hard on
the befuddled spectator as it is on
the player who has to learn it.

This clinic is soinetliing new. There
are a ;.‘,‘l‘€‘.'-‘.1. many teaching schools
for coaches tlirougzjliout the country,
but this will be the first time an ef-
fort has been made to educate the
spectator.

Danger Ahead As Lions

Defeat Navy Goats

This spring weatlier may be as
stiinulating  iintmeg to some, but
there’s still a bit of uneasiness in the
daily life of Coach Carl Olson, dean
of Pitt’s nifty stepping track team.

For a week he had Notre Dame to
worry about. He certainly did spend
a ﬁiigei'iiail_—bitiiig day last Saturday
in the point-for-point meet with the
Irish. And, scarcely taking time out
to be happy about the victory over
Notre Dame, he began to think about
the meet that followed, Penn State
at Penn State this Saturday.

While the Panthers were ﬁnding
out how toiigli a tough Notre Dame
team could be Saturday af'ternoon,
the Lions were down in Annapolis
proving that they, too, had something

A on the ball. Penn State defeated Navy

and, in so doing, exhibited enough
real power to make Cl.;on realize that
for the third straiglit tune, the dual
meet opponent of his trackers was
an ace-liigh outﬁt.

Weak On The Field

The deﬁnite liability on the Pitt
team is the weakness of the ﬁeld bri-
gade. Points in the discus, hammer.
and shotpu't are conceded before ex-
ery mcc‘.. The-1'0 is no doubt tliat Penn
State will gr:-.*.b a big portion of these
points Saturday. Added to this is an
event which rises up in a very ugly
manner to put a shadow in front of
the spring sun for Olson. It’s the jav-
elin.

Gene Taano, ’36 Penn Relay cham-
pion, has been a sure winner for the
Panthers thus far this season. But,
Penn State has a javelin thrower who
tossed the steel pole 199 feet, 8 inches
against the Navy. The best that Taano
has been able to do this year is 190
feet. That will need considerable iin—
proving to beat the Lions’ Priolo.

Oth-er problems confronting the

Panther mentor include a strained
muscle in Kenny Rydeii’s leg, and the
fact that Penn State’s cross—counti'y
captain, Howard Downey of Bellevue,
is a capable 440 man who has beaten
Art Thomas every time he has raced
against him.
' This ineeting will be the 23rd be-
tween the two state schools.
State has won 15 of the meets, but
Pitt’s record shows three straight vic-
tories in the last three years.

Witli a young man's thoughts stray-
ing in any number of directions at
this time of the year, Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, Pitt basketball coach, decided
that he had better keep basketball in
the minds of his ﬁoormen for a few
more weeks.

Monday, the varsity cage team,
augmented wi'th a bright squad of
freslimen, began passing the basket-
ball around the Stadium in the ﬁrst
day of an eight-day spring drill.

A ti undefeated golf
team will step out
into big time com-
petiiiozi this week.

Carlson Summons Basketball

Squad For Wleelfs Practice

Captain Bob Johnson will lead his
cohorts around the floor each day in
an hour practice until a week from
next Thursday. The chief purpose of
these sessions is to familiarize the
team with the new type of play. At
the annual meeting of the coaches,
the center tip was eliminated from
play. This new rule, with the team
taking the ball out of bounds after
it has been scored against, will go into
effect next season.

Pitt Netters ‘Meet
Teachers Today
011 Stadium Court

Undefeated in the two jousts they
have had this year, the Pitt tennis
team begins a strenuous court siege
this afternoon which will carry them
through four matches in the next four
days.

The Panther netters will niee't Slip-
pery Rock State Teachers College this
afternoon at the Stadium courts.
Tomorrow they travel down to Indiana
to engage the Indiana State Teachers
outﬁt.

Coming back to the Stadium courts
on Friday, the varsity will play the
freshmen in their annual match. Fea-

ture of this contest will be the strok-
ing of Joe Kristufek, freshman num-
ber one man, against Varsity Captain
Bob Madden. Kristufek was runner-
up in the public parks tourney last
summer.

The week’s competition will be con-
cluded on Saturday when the court-
men go up ‘to Grove City to play the
Grove-rs. Grove City holds a victory
over the Carnegie Tech team, and
promises to give the Panthers their
strongest opposition.

HE DEDICATION OF the new Mellon In-

stitute Building this week cannot help but stir
old thoughts again in our minds. A gleaming
monument to the new technology, created in the
interests of science, it stands as a symbol of what
has been the greatest inﬂuence in the last few
hundred years.

And yet, there is also the thought of some
thousand or more graduates donning caps and
gowns next month for a ﬁnal, formal leave-taking
of University life. Many of those graduates, an
undeterminable percentage, may never ﬁnd com-
pensation for their work. Not because they are
not able and willing; otherwise why have they
gone to college? But simply because they are not
able to ﬁnd it.

There is a disproportion somewhere; there’s a
-fly in the ointment. It’s not the fault of the engi-
neers and the scientists; it’s not the fault of the
wise men; it’s not wholly the fault of the indus-
trialists, the apitalists, the bourgeoisie, or the
system. It’s not the fault of any one of these in
particular. It belongs part and parcel to all of
them; each one had a share in bringing the prob-
lem into being. A theory of guilt based upon the
idea that one of these factors is “the devil” which
caused all the trouble is naive and gets us no-
where.

Yet, after all, the problem remains; it’s got to
be solved. It is sheer mockery to erect buildings
to science, to art, to education, to business or
anything else, if those people who are to live
during the lifetime of these buildings are not
able to enjoy them, to proﬁt by them so that they
can lead a fuller life.

We know that what we have said is more or
less old stuff, that the problem has been posed
and reposed a thousand times. Possibly, we state
these things only that we may not, because they
are so obvious, forget them as the warm spring
days come upon us.

Not only here in Pittsburgh is this situation
taking place; but why go on to say that it is
world-wide, continual, and, in all somewhat de-
pressing? No reason, except that the problem
keeps shoving itself into the forefront, wagging
away at us so that we can’t possibly forget it.

A thousand new graduates . . . How many jobs?
How will these June ﬂedglings get on? We don’t
know the answer, and we’re pretty sure that you
don’t either. But still the problem persists.—J.D.

 

Ross F inney Receives
Pulitzer Music Award

Ross Lee Finney, associate professor of music
at Smith College, Northampton, Mass., and
brother of Theodore M. Fimiey, lecturer in music
appreciation and director of the men’s glee club
at the University, was awarded the $1500 Pul-
itzer prize for music composition.

The award was publicly announced Monday
night and at the same time Mr. Finney was also
awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship to cover a
year’s creative activity in Europe. He was
granted a year’s sabbatical leave by the college
to enable him to accept the Fellowship award.

Brain Straighteners

I By Albert Lasday

The “Brain Straightener” for today is likely to cause
a little trouble, but it ‘is guaranteed to be perfectly
straight-forward—no tricks. Here it is:

A pole extends 500 feet vertically above the surface
of a lake whose circumference is also 500 feet. If a man
has a rope 501 feet long,.how can he place a noose in
the end of the rope around the base of the pole? He
has no boat and can’t swim, which means that he must
place the rope around the pole from the shore.

Incidentally, can you explain this paradox? There are
two railroad stations in Boston, the North Station and
the South Station. One of the two is the largest station
in Massachusetts, but it is not the largest in Boston.

DON’T KNOW why it is, but I always seem to get

around to reading new books long after everyone
else has. Last evening, true to form, I ﬁnally ﬁnished
Webb Miller's I Found No Peace. Published last year,
this book was recommended to me by friends, each of
whom I sedulously promised that I would read it at the
first opportunity, never quite succeeding; always just
one step behind the more fortunate borrower.

Dusty Treks And Slugs Of Lin,ot_)/pe

'I‘ IS NOT a question, I think, of worrying whether it’s
worthwhile to read a book like I Found No Peace;
nor can one ever approach reading something like it as
though the reading were an enforced chore which one
had to do in order to keep one’s friends on at least semi-
speaking terms.

Webb Miller, like George Slocombe, Negley Farson,
Vincent Sheean, and all the rest of the coierie of post-
war foreign correspondeiits, takes one behind the scenes
of present-day history and shows dictators, potentates,
and capitalists with their hair down. Through a dozen
capitals of Europe, Africa, and America the tale winds,
illuminating scenes of present conflict, lieightening the
emotional effect of world events; or to use a catch-
phrase, “bi'iii'ging the world to your own doorstep.”

Prophetic, almost despairing, as the title I Found No
Peace is, I found a kind of serenity in it; paradoxically
in the absence of certainty, there was certainty; that
the world was spinning, if only spinning no one quite
knows where.

Personally, I must confess that I did not like I Found
No Peace as Well as The Way of a Transgressor or, more
so, Personal History. Less a chronicle of world events
than any of the others, more concerned with a man’s
attempts to reach an intellectual footing on which he
could rely, as well as believe in, I thought that Vincent
Slieean did the best job. It is, I admit, less current
h-istoi‘y than “personal history.” But whether the charge
is serious is in a way irrelevant.

Marco Polo And Ghengis Khan

HESE BOOKS CARRY on a tradition, established

long ago, perhaps even before, by Marco Polo. He it
was who traveled over the roof of the world into the
valleys of western China to the Court of Ghengis Khan,
observed what he saw, and then ca-me back to tell cred-
ulous and not-so-credulous Europeans what he saw. And
Duranty and Miller and Farson do the same thing;
jocularly, carefully, they recount to us the events, and
the shifting backgrounds of those events, which take
place on the other side of the world.

But there is a difference, too. While Marco Polo de-
scribed a civilization.. remote, static, as far as Western
Civilization went, these men describe that which has
profound effect on our lives They describe a Europe,
war-weary, thought—weary, ﬂinging itself into dictator-
ship to escape confronting' intellectually a world-break-
down; they tell of individuals caught in the ﬂux, nations
and governments tottering from one mad event to an-
other. They describe a continent brilliant, bored; half-
afraid to face the future. \Vli0le peoples groping in the
dark for some kind of a match to relight the candle that
went out . . . no one seems to know quite when.

Political Whirl

By William Stark
It’s No Short Way To Capitol
Hill, But Here’s Wliat
Stark Has To Say. . .

Word has come out of Washington that the whole
town, made up mostly of Democrats for some years now,
is in great confusion. The great difficulty seems to be
that the puppets of F. 1). R. can’t make up their collec-
tive minds where they should be in this present Court
controversy. Should they follow the 1-’i'esident‘.’ What is
all that noise back home, and does it come from the
National Manufacturers Association and the Chamber of
Commerce, or from the luinpen proletariat? And added
to the great confusion, is the fact that 14‘. I). R. himself
has gone off to l*‘iorida to outdo his son in the catching
of fish.

What a sad commentary on our governnient! It is bad
enough when the bigwigs in Washington know confu-
sion, out when it seeps down through, and comes to the
attention of the hoi-polloi, that IS bad. ’1‘he intelligent
members of our society know that the leaders of our
government constantly grope around in a perpetual haze,
but when the masses get to know the truth, the blind
faith of the many, so necessary to democratic govern-
ment, is missing, and anything can happen.

Roosevelt's leaving Washington in a time of internal
instability reminds us of the story that is being circu-
lated around town of the president of a large Steel
Machine works.

It seems that this Swedish gentleman had agreed to
sign up with the Steel Workers’ Organizing Commit-
tee. All was in readiness when three or his biggest cus-
tomers “put on the heat” and forced him to back down.
1‘he S. W. 0. C. informed the gentleman that they were
just aching for a strike to keep in condition. The Swede
wilted, and after much heinniiiig and liawiiig, promised
to go to Europe, give the S.W.U.C. a chance to "put the
heat” to the three customers, and return when he could
sign without losing his customers. Last week, the down-
town papers ran a picture of the Swede boarding a
plane for New York, preced.ng a three-month trip to
Europe.

'1‘here seems to be soiiietliiiig about Florida and Eu-
rope which salves the deflated egos of so many of our
great men, but we suppose that when the hoi-polloi dis-
cover the advantages of these places which these men
know already, the latter will have to find new ways out
of precarious positions. We suggest that they find new
ways out now, rather than waste valuable time seeking
questionable sedatives for qualms of conscience.

 

In Memoriam

By IRVING BENNETT

“The brave die young,” a poet said. It ﬁts snugly over
the story of Leonard Seder. Last Saturday morning
Seder died of pneumonia in St. Francis l-Iospital.

Leonard Seder had more than mere physical bravery.
He had mental courage, the better kind of courage. He
had ideas and he stuck by them. He acted calmly and
unemotionally to direct those ideas into working cliaii-
nels.

He tried in his way to reform.

Seder was intelligent, likeable and handsome. He
chose the hard path.

There were wrongs that he felt could be riglited. At
many a meeting of the Student-Faculty Assembly, Leon-
ard Seder took the floor. Eloquently and expertly he
examined what he felt were bad situations on the cani-
pus. Although his point was discounted, he never stopped
because of that. “He was a perfect sport,” a teacher was
quoted as saying of him. “He never complained because
he was beaten.”

“Although he was only 21 when he died, Leonard
Seder accomplished something in his life-tiine. Just the
mention of two groups which are in early stages of
organization on campus proves the value of Leonard
Seder. The American Student Union chapter on the
campus owes a share of its persistency to him. So, too,
does the Pitt Co-op Club, for Seder besides being its
president was its founder and champion.

To us there is a great deal of tragedy in the news of
Leonard Seder’s death. He was just stepping into his
work, just getting started on what might possibly have
been a brilliant career when death caught him up. The
niche in this world that he was ﬁlling will perhaps be
a small one, but one that was admirable. His friends a-t
the University respect Seder, a real student, and a man
who stuck by his guns.
