First Of Four Mixer Dances
To Take Place Today;
Tickets Available

freshman girl who meets freshman
boy. That is, providing the fresh-
msan boys get around to the office of
the dean of men and call for tickets
for -the ﬁrst of the freshm.an mixer
tea dances this afternoon.

It seems that somebody forgot to
tell somebody else to tell somebody
else to notify the men of the first
year class that 75 of them could ob-
tain tickets for the tea dance to be
he-ld this afternoon from 3:30 to 5:30
o’clock.

And so, the ﬁrst 75 to request ad-

affair where they will meet 65 fresh-

Buckeye Bettridgc Is In For A Hard Fall!

Look at those Pitt defensive men coming up fast! From left to
right, Michelosen and Glassford back up Adams ‘to see that Mr. Bettridge
is brought down hard in Pitt-Ohio game at Columbus, Saturday.

Pm Day 5;; Columbus

By Campus Scout “B”

Today is Columbus Day. Saturday, however, was Sutherland
"Day.

In fact, it was a complete Panther day out around Ohio sta-
dium, Columbus, as Governor Alf Landon and 71,714 potential
Democrats, but more accurately “just plain football fans”, were
stunned by a display of Pitt power that reached a climax midway
in the ﬁnal period when “Curly” Ste-bbins “broke” with the win-
ning run that had been expected ‘all afternoon.

Final score stood 6-0, with the Smoky City boys charging des-
perately for a second touchdown in "a last-stretch drive that com-
pletely erased any hope for the Scarlet hurricane to open up with
their “razzle-dazzle” offense of trick shuffles and lateral passes.

The game spelt “power” from start to ﬁnish with the defensive
play of both teams over-shadowing any kind of an offensive attempt
of either team, with the exception of Pitt’s opening and closing
marches. Goldberg and Patrick paced the opening drive but the
ﬁrst period whistle interrupted the parade just long enough for
the ﬁnal “putsch” to fall short by a scant yard. Ironically, it was
Stebbins, the ultimate hero, who failed to gain that extra foot for
“ﬁrst-and-goal” on the three-yard stripe.

By virtue of this victory, Jock Sutherland’s squad climbed

\/

But this game only makes the rest of the season more difficult.
Duquesne next Saturday will test ‘the Panthers to the limit. Then
follows Notre Dame, Fordham, Penn State, Nebraska and ﬁnally
Tech. From the Hilltoppers to the Tartans, Pitt's power will be
threatened.

Therefore, it is not lik-ely that the skyscraper lads will arrive
anywhere near the peak until most of those outﬁts are dealt with.
Perhaps that peak will be acclaimed prematurely on campus. To
‘the squad and coaches, however, there remains much to be done.
Saturday was only the beginning.

Watching from the press box seats were ‘the best of the “won-
der-proclaiming” commentators, including Grantland Rice, Francis
Wallace, George Kirksey, and other “honor” students in the school.
They will undoubtedly “blow up” the iP'i‘tt victory balloon.

Meanwhile Dr. Sutherland’s scouts will be confronted with
the task of telling the Columbus-conquerors of a Husker crew
that lost dishearteningly to Minnesota"s last-minute Gophers. Ford-
ham’s Ram will be even more battering than the deadlocking animal
that carried the play to the Panthers last fall in the Polo Grounds.

News To Tabulate
Campus Voting Trend

By William Stark

Some four weeks from today the
‘.1936 presidential campaign will be
history. The sovereign voter, John
Q. Public, that person who masquer-
ades behind a variety of pseudonyms,
will have decided who he wants to be
the chief executive of the United
States.

There is a varie-ty of choices of-
fered: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Demo-
crat; Alfred M. Landon, Republican;
Norman Thomas, Socialist; William
Lemke, Union; Earl Browder, Com-
munist; David Colvin, Prohibition;
and John Aiken, Socialist-Labor.

Although a great number of col-
lege students are below the legal age
for voting, they do have opinions.

And it is precisely these opinions
that the News will try to record.
Beginning today, The News will con-
duct a survey of campus opinion on
the presidential election, gathering
samples of opinion from students on
their choices of candidates for the
presidency. The poll will be held in
conjunction with the Pittsburgh Press
and the American Institute of Public
Opinion, which releases the weekly
feature “America Speaks” to many
large dailies throughout the country.
' According to present plans, a spe-
clal group of students will circulate
around campus starting today, and in-
terview approximately ten per cent
of the student body. Students in all

Leave it to ‘the engineers to ﬁg-
me a new angle for dance publicity.
This time, according to one of them,
“the engineers are going to celebrate
the Notre Dame -game beginning the
night before.” Just how this will
be -done is to be seen at the dance.
but William Mc'Q'ua«de, E37_ chair-
man of the Annual Fall Dance, has
some bee in his c~.ommittee’s bonnet.

This affair, “the smoothest, easiest
dance of the year,” .swells the co.
eﬂicient of expansion .-at the Grotto
Ballroom on the evening of October
23rd.

Retaining the true engineering
spirit, the EA has persuaded Bob
Duncan, ChE37, maestro of slow, so-
Phisticated Wing rhythm, to replace
his slide rule with a baton and to
Wave mysterious ﬁgures in front -of
his band, one which has won much
praise at many local dances,

Ralph Sherrit and Miss Maude
Schaub lend the vocal atmosphere to
Duncan’s arrangements. Two half
hours on the air over WWSW are
among the tentative arrangements
drawn up by Duncan.

The dance is one of the “dollar
lows” which the engineers have been
featuring lately. Tickets are on sale
and may be obtained from any of
the members of the EA cabinet.

Debaters To Quiz
Pujfer On Utilities

Claude E. Puffer, instructor in eco-
nomics, will meet with members of
the University debating squad Wed-
nesday afternoon, during the ﬁfth
hour in Room 308, Alumni Hall.

Mr. Pulfer is a specialist in this
ﬁeld, having spent a year in Wash-
ington, D. C., doing special work on
public utilities. All freshmen as
well as varsity membeis are to at-
tend, and any outsiders will be wel-
come to take part in the discussion.

Members of the team are now en-
gaging in practice debates .on the
subject, “Resolved, That All Electric
Utilities Should Be Governmentally
Owned and Operated.” The ﬁrst of
these contests began Friday and the
series extends over a period of two
weeks.

Announcement has also been made
of the selection of the\Pi Kappa
Delta intercollegiate debate topic for
this year, which is, “Resolved, That
Congress Shall Be Empowered to Fix
Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours
for Industry.” This, together with
the utilities question, will form the
basis for all of this season's debates,
according to Charles W. Lomas, coach
of the squad.

Oliver Talks Tonight

Dr. John W. Oliver, head of the
department of history, will address
the American Society of Civil En-
gineers at a banquet at the P. A. A.

“Beauty is truth, truth beauty;
That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”

Rushing season begins this morning.

When Keats made that remark about truth he probably had
no idea that one day it might be lifted from a Grecian urn to a
fraternity rushing season; but here it is, and what are you going

be the turning point upon which des-
tiny rests during this week.

It will be up to the lowly and
presumably green freshmen to blow
the chaff from the wheat, as, begin-
ning at 8 o’clock this morning, he
becomes the focal point of attention
and the sine qua. non. (That’s the
way Caesar would have said: “We
can't do without ’em.)

Plenty of Events

If y-ou’re a freshman, you’re prob-
ably too busy by now to read this,
since rushing rules gave fraternity
men a 30-minute start over The Pitt
News, but, anyway, here’s what you
can expect for the rest of the week:
Smokers where you meet all the old
alumni, important faculty m-en, if
they’re good speakers, and miscel-
laneous brothers; theater parties, as
many of them as you can stand; din-
ners, better than usual; and dates
and dances beyond your wildest
dreams.

For the whole week, freshmen will
be catered to as they have never
before been catered to. And ac-
cording to N. Robert Seidle, former
assistant to the dean of men and for
the past three years adviser to fra-
ternities, this rushing season will be
more elaborate and more successful
than any he has witnessed.

The two factors upon which he
bases his predictions are that fresh-
man enrollment has increased by a
sizeable number, and that rushing
season, shortened to only six days,
!Wlll be more condensed and therefore
more intensive.

Ban Lifted

From registration week until this
morning, Interfraternity Council has
kept a strict ban on all rushing of
any sort. No fraternity man has
been permitted to “talk fraternity”
to any freshman. During the period
beginning at 8 o’clock this morning
and extending till 2 o’clock next

To All Rushees

‘ I-IE MUCH-HERALDED and long-awaited rushing period
opens this morning. For the freshmen and other new Students

it means a week of concentrated

smokers, dances and other events designed to show them a good
time. Behind this entertainment which can be described only in
superlative terms is a more serious consideration on the part of
fraternity men to secure new additions for their respective groups.

Fraternity -men consider all new students “potential pledges,”
and it is the desire of each fraternity to pledge as many men as
they feel will ﬁt into their group. Therefore, it is important for
each rushee to consider seriously the selection of a fraternity, and
during this week of rushing he should visit as many different
houses as possible. He should not hesitate to ask questions about
the fraternity which he visits; that is, pointed and speciﬁc ques-
tions concerning the cost of membership, the ﬁnancial stability of
the chapter, the national reputation of the fraternity and the gen-
eral interest of the members in campus activities.

Next week will be the silence or bidding period. This week
of absolutely no fraternity activity is planned to afford an oppor-
tunity for the rushee to weigh carefully the advantages and dis-
advantages of fraternity membership. It is during this week that
he must decide whether or not to join a fraternity.
to join one, his next question .is “which fraternity?” It is a de-
cision which will last a long time, and no freshman can afford to

make a mistake.

Membership in a fraternity is a valuable asset and it is to be
hoped that the fraternities will enjoy a successful rushing season.
My ﬁnal advice to the freshman is to join a fraternity if he can
afford it, and to be very careful in his choice.—N. ROBERT
SEIDLE, former adviser to fraternities and present head of the

University Placement Bureau.

Local Professor Practices
As Well As Preaches
Economic Theory

 

By Robert Saffron

professor of economics, who glad-
dened the hearts of the News featu-
riters last year with his kitten “Ism,”
now tells of his pencil collection:

“Now isn’t that a peculiar hobby,
collecting pencils?_ Why do I do it,
I wonder? Hmmmm. Why, I think
I have about 500 pencils altogether.
Yes—th-ink of that! Started in 1920,
when I ﬁrst came to the University,
just to have pencils handy, and now
I can’t stop. It’s lots of fun. Yes!
Yes! All kinds of pencils; from al-
most every country in the world.”

He displays a pencil in a bullet;
one with a miniature broom on the
end of it; another a trick device
which bends in the middle; and then,
proudly, two huge affairs.

“These are my two gemS- Yes-
Keep them under lock and key.” One
is 13 inches long, an inch thick, and
has a genuine lead about the width
of your little ﬁnger. For some un-
known reason it sports an accurate
thermometer on the outside. Another
pencil, almost the same size, a sou-
venir of the Philadelphia Sesqui-Cen-
tennial celebration, has attached to it
a miniature Liberty Bell which actu-
ally tinkles. The smallest is approxi-
niately the size of a match stick.

“How do I get them? Oh, I don’t
know. I look for them. I’ve explored
every ﬁve-and-ten-cent store from
here to Boston. Think of that ——
think of that! I carry several in my
pockets to exchange with students
who may have an exotic variety I
haven’t collected yet. Yes. And
some of them have interesting ad-
vertisements, too. Hmmmm. Look
at these.”

One pencil advertises “Old Hon-
esty Soap.” Another, the gift of a
maker of disk harrows and cultiva-
tors (used in farming), assures you
“Vile Appreciate Your Business.” Two
others, identical in color and shape,
ask you to vote for “Landon and
Knox” and “Roosevelt and Garner.”
Simply and majestically, another
merely states “Morris Mermelstein,
Ambridge, Pa.” But the prize “ob-
jet d’art” is “Vogue Foundations-
a garment for every ﬁgure.”

“Yes, I’m going to classify and
sort them some day when I get time,”
says Dr. Ferguson. “When I travel,
I’ll try to get one from absolutely
every country in which they’re made.
Hmm. And I hear there's a pencil
with a rubber lead which bends when
you try to write. Think of that! Now
I wonder, wouldn't that be great?
Yes, I’ll have to go after it.”

Army Biplane Resides I

On University Campus

Probably very few people except
aeronautical and mining engineers
have ever known that a nine-year-old
Army biplane, minus the wings,
peacefully reposes across from a bat-
tery of assaying furnaces up in the
School of Mines and Track House
building.

Used for practical demonstration
purposes in aeronautical engineering
courses, the old Consolidated model

PT-1 training plane has been a-t the
University for three years. It was
procured in 1933 through the Mate-
rial Division of the Army Air Corps.

Now, the khaki-colored fuselage,
shorn of its bright yellow wings,
which stand in frames against the
wall, is becoming dustier and dirtier
between the occasional times that en-
gineers climb over the old plane to
se.e what used to make it run.

It Still Perks

In contrast to the smartly stream-
lined planes of today, the PT-1 is an-
tique in -appearance. But it can still
run. Henry C. Pavian, assistant pro-
fessor of :aeronautical engineering,
has taxied it around the Trees prac-
tice ﬁeld, since that is the only place
on the campus where it can be moved.

There’s a reason for the apparently
old-fashioned design of the Univer-
sity’s demonstration plane. “All
training pl-antes,” Mr. Pavian ex-
plained, “crack up rather frequently,
so the vital parts must be easily ac-
cessible for repairs. As streamlining
makes it harder for mechanics to get
at many parts of the plane, training
planes don’t have the smooth lines of
most of the newer models. Army
training planes in use now have prac-
tiially the same design as this ship.”

Dashboard Shy Of Instruments

Compared to equipment on the air-
line transports, the gadgets on the
University's plane seem primitive.
The only instruments in the PT-1 are
water and oil temperature gauges, an
oil pressure gauge, and a tachometer,
which counts the number of motor
revolutions per minute. Most com-
mercial plan-es in use today have
from thirty to ﬁfty different devices
as aids in ﬂying and navigation.

In explaining this difference, Mr.
Pavian says: “Army planes today
have only a few more instruments
than this one. For most military fly-
ing, instruments like the radio beam

of the 1932 candidates.

are useless; they add to the weight of
the plane, which must be kept at a

minimum, and they are very expen-
sive.”

Because of the activities of some
of Pittsburgh’s youngest aviators, the
instruments are still in the plane, but
they’re not connected any more. It
seems that one day when Mr. Pavian
was working near the plane, he heard
a noise inside. Going to the side, and
tapping on it, he was surprised to
see four small b-oys scramble out of
the cockpits.

The type of people who carve in-
itials on pyramids have left a few
souvenirs in the front cockpit of the
PT-1. Some of them, including a
colonel and two captains, have done
it right and written out their last
names. A few other timid souls have
chosen to remain anonymous by writ-
ing only initials.

Stebbins Breaks Loose For

Classic’ As Defensive Team Play Stands Out;
Panthers Stay In National Title Picture

 

In the first game, "Ohio Wesleyan, it Was Marshall Goldberg.
In the ‘second game, West Virginia, it was Leo M'alarkey. Sat-
urday, out in ‘Cohimbus against Ohio State, it was the curly-
headed ‘sophomore boy, Harold ‘Stebbms.

That ‘about sums up all the indi-

these, ‘by 5far the highest point ‘was
rearihed ‘two ‘days ‘ago when gstebbins’

whfippeld ‘a stubb‘o1'n Ohio State elev-
en "before ithe 71,000 people that
jam-med the huge State horse shoe
bowl in 'Co‘-lunib‘us.

istebbins’ ‘-run was ‘just what the
‘fans had ‘been ‘looking for and ex-
rpecting since the -opening ‘whistle -of
the ‘Pant-her-B'uc*keye national title
Elea-d cla-sh. The Panthers’ tremen-
-dous power ‘had ‘the Buckeyes run-
ning "around in circles all afternoon.
Power, treinen-douvs P-anther power,
cengtulfed ‘the Ohio Staters at every
"turn and it was power ‘that ﬁnally
licked the Buckeyes.

Make "Sustained ‘Drives

'The score .at 6-0, Pitt, might eas-
ily have ‘been 20-‘O forthe Panthers.
lEarly Sin the ﬁrst quarter, the Suth-
erland Scythe "had cut its way 58
‘yards "to the four-yard line only to
he stopped short of the goal. In the
‘ﬁnal ﬁve minutes of the game, after
‘the Panther ‘powerhouse had scored,
‘it ‘began -'once ‘m»ore,'this time going
for -66 yards, '-Orily “to have the gun
sound as they ‘made a ﬁrst down on
‘the State ‘fozur-‘yard line.

All 'in rill, the Panthers totaled 11
ﬁrst ‘downs to the Buckeye’S ﬁve and
gained 243 yards {from scrimmage to
Six for ‘-Ohio State. In between
times, ‘the Pitt ‘boys kept the famed
Ohio State “‘razz'le-dazzle” attack so
bottled up that all it needed was a
.'label for :a new Heinz pro-duct. Time
.-and :time ‘again the Panther line br-oke
.through ‘to throw the State runners
«or gpassers for ‘huge losses.

‘Everyone Stars!

‘It was one of the best exhibitions
«of blocking, ‘rushing, and defensive
play ‘tha-t the Panthers ever gave. To
‘pick one Iindividual star would be like
"picking -;one beautiful girl out of
Hollywood, :in both cases it wouldn’t
.be fair to ‘the rest. A gr-eat deal of
praise should'.beThanded the Panther
-ends, .Bill Daddio and Fabian Hoff-
man, who were more often than not
"in the "State backﬁeld as quickly as
the ‘ball. Biff ’.Glassford also put
forth one of his best games, so did
Ave "Daniell, and Matisi, and Patrick,
and Leziouski and . . . that active
«crew of Ilinemen.

Throughout the battle, the Pan-
ithers tused nothing but straight pow-
er plays. Not ‘a single Pitt pass was
‘thrown during the afternoon, which
is some Sort of arecord for the Ohio
State stadium.

It was also the ﬁrst time a Schmidt-
coached Buckeye team was shut out
without -a score. In fact, the closest
the State ‘lad got to the Panther goal
was late in the ‘third quarter when
they moved past the middle stripe
over to the Pitt 43-yard line.

In only one department could the
Schmidt eleven claim superiority
over the Sutherlands and that was in
the kicking. Ohio ‘State’s kicks av-
eraged 39 yards while the Panthers’

booted out a .33 yard average.

Game ‘Comments

Most everyone had something to
say about the :outcome of Saturday’s
“Columbus ‘Classic?’

Comments ranged from “Jock”
Sutherland’s expected “I am very
much pleased,” to Merle Wendt’s,
Ohio ;'State captain, “Now I know
what real "blocking is.”

Coach Francis Schmidt of the
Buckeyes could be found nowhere
immedia'tely ‘following the game
but had this ‘to say later in the
evening: “Pitt has one of the great-
est football teams I have ever seen.
We made some mistakes sure, but
we inst .didn’t have it. They did.

“They ‘were ‘big, but still fast.
They were smartand they certain-
ly were well coached,” he con-
cluded.

Grantland Rice, commentator, said
“The Pitt line was the deciding fac-
tor in that contest.”

Athletic Director L. W. St. John,
Ohio, thought that"‘The Pitt line was
magniﬁcent, and better because of
the game they played in face of a
line playing as well as our own did.”

Assistant Coach Godfrew, Ohio,
never saw a‘tea.m with more power,
believing Pitt should have scored
three or four touchdowns.

Harry Grayson, sports editor of
NEA ‘service, was “surprised that
Pitt failed to score more than she
did."

As most people already know, Pitt
threw not one pass all afternoon.
Neither team fumbled during the en-
tire 60 minutes of play.

Cinder Events Usher In Annual
Novice Track Meet Wednesday

 

‘Swell,’ -says Coac'h'Carl Olson, and
that applies to more than just the
condition of the .entry list of the an-
nual All-University Novlice Track and
Field Meet to be staged Wednesday
and Thursday, October 14 and 15.
The entry list is swelling each addi-
tional day that it is left open, but
plans for the meet are swell, too.

The schedule for the two day nov-
ice track and ﬁeld day are divided ac-
cording to the character ofthe events.
Wednesday, October 14, the opening
day of competition, will be devoted
to the boys who do the running, the
trackmen. All dash, distance, and

long distance races will be completed
Wednesday. Thursday, October 15,
will be ﬁlled with the ﬁeld events,
weight contests and jumps.

There is still time enough to ﬁll
out an entry blank, hand it in to Mr.
Olson, and get in the meet. For
those who have already -entered, prac-
tice sessions have been going on
daily.

An entry blank will be found be-
low. It must be ﬁlled out and handed
in to Olson at the Stadium by Wed-
nesday. Four o’clock on Wednesday
is the starting time of the track
events.

New WAA
‘Program

Scheduled

Women Plan Sports Events
In Swimming, Hockey
For Coming Year

 

With the Coed Prom of 1936 only
a memory,- WAA is busying itself
planning a program for the year in
which all WAA members will par-
ticipate.

At a recent board meeting, Audrey
Graham, president, appointed the fol-
lowing chairmen to have charge of
fall sports: Eleanor Fedigan, swim-
ming; Sally Brunson, hockey; Myra
Edwards, recreational sports. Betty
Cox is chairman of sports for the
entire year.

There will be swimming every
Tuesday and Thursday from 4:30 to
5:00 o’clock, hockey every Tuesday
and Thursday from 4:00 to 6:00
o’clock, recreational sports every
Tuesday and Thursday from 4:00 to
6:00 o’clock and also Fridays at
noon. Players must bring their own
shoes, but gym and swimming suits
will be furnished.

While they were staying in Pitts-
burgh, the members of the Welsh
hockey team were entertained at a
luncheon at the Ruskin Apartments.

Virginia Boyd, vice president and
social chairman of WAA, has re-
ceived an invitation from Indiana
State Teachers College requesting
WAA to send eight women to repre-
sent the University at their inter-
collegiate play day on October 31.
The board accepted the invitation,
but has not yet named its represen-
tatives.

Dr. Taylor Will Speak
At First Mathematics
Colloquium Tomorrow

Dr. J. S. Taylor will address the
first Mathematic Colloquium tomor-
row afternoon at 2:30 o’clock in
Room 104, Alumni Hall.

Dr. Taylor, who attended the Math-
ematics Conference at the recent Har-
vard Tercentenary, will devote his
talk to a review of numerous papers
presented at that meeting. He will
give special attention to the papers
of Professor Levi-Civita of the Uni-
versity of Rome and Dr. A. E. Ed-
dington of England.

The Colloquium is held primarily
for professors and instructors in
mathematics, but students are invited
to attend.
