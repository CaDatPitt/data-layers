  Students to Be Deferred

For Defense Occupations

Although there will be no blan-
fltet selective ‘service deferment for
college students this year, many
students in good standiig‘ and who

enrolled before possible induction
was anticipated will receive defer-
Vments on various bases.

If a _local board determines
that a particular student regis-
trant is in training and prepara-
tion to perform a national de-
fense function, and that there
will be a shortage in that occupa-

Harriet Harris, E42, and John
P Hughes, C42, co-chairmen of the

demonstrations block, announced
that special equipment will be
furnished to all members of the
block along with. the usual blue
‘ and gold reversible capes so that
~ all may take part in the “chorus"
number.

There also will be an “Old Oak-
‘en Bucket” formation and sing,
along with two arrangements of
“God Bless America.” “I’ve Been
Working on the Railroad” also will
be featured by the band.

Miss Harris stated that demon-
stration block registrations will
close today at 5 o’clock.

“All those wishing to sign
should do so immediately in the
elevator lobby of the Cathedral,”
“The best seats in
the student section are in the

tion, it will defer such a student.

It is the shortage in the occu-
pation which forms the basis of
deferment and not the fact that
the registrant is a student.

Local boards may grant tem-
porary postponement of induction
to prevent undue hardships.

Students may receive at any
time information as to their stat-
us concerning the draft and their
schooling from the local board.
The basic rule is that students
who are to be inducted near the
completion of the school term, at

the end of a school term, or be- .

tween school terms be inducted
without delay.
‘ Local boards who decide that a
student will not be called until the
middle of his school term, will ad-
vise that student to start his term,

, for he will not be inducted in the

middle of a semester.

University information concern-
ing the problems deferment
and postponement may be obtain-
ed from the deans of the various
schools.

There is also a dean’s commit-
tee on selective service composed
of Dr. E. A. Gilmore, dean of the
School of Law; Dr. E. A. Hol-
brook, dean of the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines; and Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford, dean of the
College.

A This committee, however, is a
policy forming com ittee and the
actual administratiweof student
and faculty requests for defer-
ment should be delegated to the
deans, who will carry out the
policies of the central committee.

‘An excellent opportunity to

quired to pass the Customs exams
will be offered to freshman
women when they come to the

morrow.

completion would greatly enhance
the attractiveness of the ﬂoor, ac-
cording to Mrs. Dice.

“However, we have plans made
to follow this up with personal
contact immediately,” Mrs. Dice
added.

The decorations will be carried
out in a quiet solemn motif. Upon
its completion the room will hold
delicately carved ornaments, and
literature and painting represen-
tative, of the period.

A portrait of Miss Amos, to
be presented to her upon her
twenty-ﬁfth anniversary‘ as dean
of women, had been previbusly
considered by the alumnae asso-
ciation. Since her death, how-
ever, plans for the drawing room
were formulated. Many mem-
bers believed that the portrait
alone would not be a sufficient
and lasting memorial.

Contributions will be sought
from alumni, faculty, and secre-
tarial staff, as well as from friends
not connected with the University.

Students will contribute as soon
as Jean Brink, C42, undergradu-
ate chairman of the drive begins
her campaign on campus.

Committee members include:
Martha B. Dittmann, secretarial
staﬁ; Mary Virginia Griffiths,
ex-officioi; Lotte Lohstetter, fac-
ulty; Nell McKenry, alumnae,
1898-1925; Louise Borland Nich-

Top Rating

John Brosky, C42, editor of the
1942 Owl, announced at the meet-
ing of the editorial and business
staff last Wednesday that the
1941 Owl has received a first class
rating from the National Scholast-

The_1941 Owl is one of the 15
yearbooks from schools equal in
size with the University that re-
ceived the ﬁrst class rating.

The theme of the 1942 year-
book, “Hand in Hand at Pitt,"
is based upon Pitt spirit of a. uni-
ﬁed student body working to-
word a common goal, and photo-
graphs of hands,_ symbolic_of a
dynamic character, will express
the idea of progress, stated
Brosky. ,

Other additions to the new Owl .

will include much larger under-
graduate class sections, pictures of
the undergraduate leaders, four or
ﬁve full page pictures of pictorial
Pitt, and color photos of the sen-
ior queen and alma mater.

"Fight Now or Fght

Alone Later’

by PAUL F. LOHMEYER
“Unless we ﬁght now, we will
be forced to ﬁght later--alone.”
Vigorous and dogmatic, Major
General John F. O’Ryan, retired,
New York state director of Civil-
ian Defense, punctuated his
words with a rap on the table, as
he denounced isolationists and
their policies.

“The views of the isolationists
are unsound,” the General said, in
an interview Monday. “We are
faced with the greatest conqueror
of all time, we are the bullseye
of Hitler’s target.”

“The strategy that Hitler em-
ploys is the standard pattern for
conquest used for ages. Knock
them out one at a time. The na-
tions who are left alone are in-
diﬂ’erent to the fate of their
neighbors, until they are next.”

“If we wait, we will either
fight with the other nations look-
ing on in a smug, sneering way,
or we will take it lying down. ln
either case we have "no option,
we must ﬁght!"

“It has been our policy to pur-
:hase time,rand to try.t’o buy off
our obligation with money and ma-
terial that we send in lieu of our

physical support. All the money,’

and all of the material we can
send would be turned down if
England were offered 3 divisions
of troops in place of this aid.”

“The moral support of these
troops, even the word that Ameri-
can men were in the war, would
. . incite riots in Germany and
German controlled lands . . . and
would cause the overthrow of
Mussolini, by the Italian people,
who love American ideas and in-
'stitutior_1s.’’ ,

General O’Ryan, who command-
ed the twenty-seventh division in
Europe in the last war, attributed
the causes of this war to the fact
that there was no‘“World Police

ler intq Qzeghgslqratie

The General stated, too, that if

da, Norway, Sweden, the United’

States, and all the other countries
of the globe had said they would

“Dear Adolf,

“This is an open letter to you.
I am takingthe liberty of being
informal since I know so much
about you. You see, I ‘read John
Gunther’s “Inside Europe” and
know all the dirt. .I’ll bet the boys
used to call you “Schick” when
you were just a little shaver.

“Well, what I want to tell you
is how to defeat those nasty Rus-
sians. When the time comes that
an army, when it is surrounded,
doesn't have enough sense to
give up; or when soldiers pretend
that they are dead and then get
up and shoot you in the back,
well, a man needs some sort of
advice or he’ll go crazy. Adolph,
there’; only one way to beat those
mad Russians and that's with the
aid of the American newspapers.

Finland

“Just look whatthey did for
Finland. In the Finnish war, they
stripped Joe,Stalin’s doughboys of
all decent clothing and left them
with nothing but miserable rags.
They took those Slavs and froze
every other one, not to mention
their horses. The bullets, bombs,
and Molotov breadbaskets were
transformed into harmless duds.

“The Red generals were made
into nincompoops, the commis-
sars into inefficiency experts, and
the morale into the spirit of a
University of Chicago cheering’

section. You see, Adolph, neither _

Keitel nor Goebbels can be near-
lly so effective. '

“There are two drawbacks, how-
ever. First of all, you will have to
win the last battle alone, as the
Finns will readily attest. Second-
ly, I don’t think the American
newspapers will help you.”

"CapitalIsts' ~
Editor, the Pitt News:

University students today are
being «faced with the prospect of
increasing prices in the cost of ma-
terials, in the cost of food, and in
the cost of education itself.

In attempting to put a ceiling
on prices or on wages it must
first be ascertained who or what
is the cause for this tremendous
upswing in the cost of living.

None of the blame should fall
upon the shoulders of the working
man, ‘A g

The laborer wants no proﬁts; he
wants nozluxui-ies;,he does not de-

er whether even
herent drudgery -

rsal application,
re despite much
society has en-

duties of each

sire special or extraordinary privi-
leges. All he wants is the right to
be able to clothe his family de-
céntly; to be able to eat decently;
to be able to live decently. All he
wants is to be able to have a home,
to be able to keep that home go-
ing, and then someday to be able
to leave his job and his work and
live out his days in security and in
peace. ,  ,
That is what the working man
wants. Nothing but security.
Big Business ’
Any blame for the increasing
rise in the cost of living mustcbe

laid at the feet of the _entrepre-‘

neur, of the manager, of the big
business man.

He alone is responsible for the
high prices of food and materials.
Guided by the capitalistically in-
spired proﬁt motive, be seized up-
on the defense program as a lever
with whichto enrich himself at
the expense of the hated laboring
man. His motive was not security,
for he saw in this a chance to revel

in luxury, to have sleek automo-

biles, ‘and winters in Florida. Lux-
ury and greed were his reasons
for increasing his prices.

But, the bolo is returning.

The working man, ‘driven almost
to empty pockets by the pressure
of the capitalist, demanded, and
was reluctantly granted, a general
pay increase. That was the first
step in the downfall of the "right
of capitalists to set prices as they
choose ‘without any regard for
others.

Bullheaded

Step number two came when
the capitalist, with typical bull-
headedness, increased his prices
morethan enough to cover the
laborer’s increase in wages.

Now the ‘third and perhaps ﬁnal
step is approaching. It is inevit-
able that" within a-few days the
national government will impose
some ceiling on prices. That ceil-
ing will be on prices, not on
wages; for. the‘ governmentwell
realizes where the fault lies.

Thus, the crack in the struc-
ture of the capitalistic system
will be widened by another inch;
and all through the boneheaded-
ness of the plutocratic capitalists.

May Seegle, indefatigable local
impressario, has lined up a pro-
gram for the rapidly approaching
season that promises to keep cul-
tural-minded Pittsburghers pretty
much on the go this winter.

The concert season gets off to
an early start October 17. On’ that
date, Miss Beegle brings to Syria
Mosque a company of singers to
do Donizetti’s ‘light opera gem,
“Don Pasquale.”

The “big names” on Miss
Beegle’s list of artists do not show

up until after the Christmas holi-.

days when in succession are list-
ed Heifetz, Nelson Eddy, Horo-
witz, and the diminutive Lily Pons.
With Eugene Ormandy on the
podium conducting the Philadel-
phia Symphony, Miss Beegle's or-
chestral series gets under way on
Otober 31. Koussevitzky and his
Boston Symphony appear in De-
cember. The Minneapolis Sy_m-
phony with its celebrated Greek
conductor, Mitropoulos, is booked
for February 13. The series closes
in May with a return of the Phila-
delphia orchestra. ‘

band as “more difficult, precise,
and streamlined.” He also added,
“the band has been rehearsing
and drilling since the week be-
‘fore school started—p'racticing
at least ﬁveltimes a week—-and
the boys are looking toward a
great season."

band include Guy D. Wallace,
C41, student manager, Sidney Sei-
gel, C41, associate manager,

to their socks, and carry Lime

Gould Tells
Oi Placements

Ninety-ﬁve per cent of the June
graduates in the School of Educa-

tion have been placed in element— ,

.ary and secondary schools, Dr.
George Gould, professor of Eng-
lish and director of student teach-
ing revealed today.

“This year,” continued Dr.
Gould, “has been the best place-
ment year in the ﬁeld of education
for the University in 10 years.”

In the elementary schools, 17
out of the'19 majors in elementary
education were placed. English
majors who were placed in second-
ary schools totaled ﬁve out of 11;
history majors, four out of 10;
biological science majors, three
out of six; French majors, two out
of four; German majors, one out

of one; and Latin majors, three.

out of three.

‘Dr. Gould said that the splendid
showing was due to the increased
prosperity caused by national de-
fense.

Schools Use New

Plan for Degrees

A co-operative arrangement be-
tween the school of education a-nd
Medill school of journalism at
Northwestern University, ﬁrst of
its kind in American educational
circles, goes into eﬁect this fall,
providing gt joint-degree program
enabling students to receive their
bachelor’s degree in education at
the end of the fourth year and
their master’s degree in journal-
ism at the end of the ﬁfth.

The new plan supplements a
teacher’s sequence offered by Me-
dill in which students may re-

,ceive the master’: degree by com-

ing up through the college of lib-
eral arts. The new joint-degree
program permits a stronger back-
ground in education.

Students in the new program

remain in the school of education

for their first three 'years.), They
transfer to journalism for” their
fourth and ﬁfth ‘years but receive
their bachelor’s degree from the
school of education at the end of
the fourth.

‘TOM MELTON ‘C@—I’CA—PTAINS BOILERMAKERS

\

A '5“ Z
Alex Zelenski
Sports Editor

We have a new problem to consider in connection with

the oncoming Purdue-Pitt football game this Saturday. It
concerns the quality of resiliency, or just how much bounce
the Purdue gridders have in them.
V They were favored in their opening game against Van-
derbilt last Saturday afternoon,‘ and were knocked off, 3-0.
It now remains for them to demonstrate whether they have
enough elasticity to bounce back, and if they do will it be
in the face of the Bowser coached ball club?
A Most Unex ected Loss

Up at est Lafayette, Ind. the loss was not considered
impossible, but it was thought to be highly improbable. Re-
ports from the college newspapers show that nothing more
disconcerting than a close game was anti-
cipated and there were lyrical hopes for a
one—sided victory. At the end of the after-
noon the gloom was probably at its thickest,
for the Boilermakers went down to ‘defeat.

The reason for all this ‘gloom on the
Purdue campus is that the Boilermakers
were figuring to be in the thick of the Big
Ten race this year. But from all the re-
ports it seems as though Mal Elward will have to resort to
the old West Virginia University axiom of “nextyear will
be the year.”

Can They Come Back?

Unfortunately or otherwise, there is no way we can
peel off the shirts from the football players and tell what a
psychological effect that disastrous adventure against Van-
derbilt did to them. Will they rebound against Pitt ‘with

V a terrific bang or will they be demoralized by their loss, and

sulk while the Pitt backs go running by‘?

Now, while we’re speaking of psychol-
ogy, let’s take a look at the Panther scene.
The Jungle Cats are in the best of physical
and mental condition for the defeat suffered
by Purdue did not in any way harm the
Panthers. In fact, the loss makes the out-
look a little more rosy.

Pitt has a potentially great bal club
this year, and the coaching; staff knows it.
Hence the silence around the athletic office.
Regardless of what the critics have to say about the Panth-
Erisl, they won’t have to take aback seat for anyone this
=a .

Offensive Powers Stressed

Offensive powers will definitely be stressed this year
by Coach Bowser for he has a jackrabbit backfield, one
capable of running, passing, and kic’king with the best of
them. What about defense you say? Well, the contest
still goes to the team ‘with a greatest number of scores.
You know the old saying: a good offense is the best de-
gfense.
V Walt West and Johnny Ross, varsity quarterback and
fullback respectively, will, undoubtedly, be 60 minute men
on the field this fall. Bill Dutton has a very capable under-
study in Joe Connell, and Jack Stetler still has Edgar Jones
to spell him off. This ‘sounds like a very powerful quartet,

""1.

By ART REINSTEIN

The nightmare that is Pitt’s
football schedule has lost a little
of its scare. For last week Purdue’s
highly-rated Boilermakers, who
open the Panthers’ season here
stalled completely against a sup-
posedly mediocre Vanderbilt elev-
en and were booted into a 3-0 de-
feat.

Mal Elward‘s veterans pounded
in vain at Vandy’s line, never
thijeateniiig to score. And though
nine Seniors ﬁlled varsity posts
for Purdue’s opener, indications
are that the old Notre Damer and
his aides still have quite a polish-
ing job to perform. before their
proteges can be rated a sure shot
over Charlie Bowser’s tough Y0\1Y1.€1'
men. ~ A

Purduemen Impressive

On’ the completely unwarrant-
ed assumption that Purdue’s Ed-
ward will stick by his original
lineup in Saturday's encounter,
we present the probable Boiler-
maker eleven, ‘complete with case
history and condensed publicity
blurb.

Purdue tailback is Johnny Gal-
vin, who numbers amoiig h1s'ol’fcn-
sivei weapons left-footed kiclciiig.
right-handed passing, clever run-
ning, and an “Irish sniile.” _ .

Right-half is hard-driving Junior
letterm-an Tony Berto. Big Tony
is a smart passer and a rugged
blocker and ball—carrie‘r.

Directing Purdue’s Notre Dame
offense is Senior Bob Kersey, a
competent ﬁeld general.

Pittsburgher John Petty, 210
pounds of battering-ram fullback,
carries a big share of the offensive
load and is touted by Purdue 513
a candidate for all-star honors.

Sophomore Takes Over

Only sophomore in the lineup
is center Bob Johnson, stepping
ahead of -the veteran Alex Leugo
into the big shoes of Ted Axton,
last year’: ace pivot man.

Flanking the Boilermaker line
are Seniors Bill Combs and Jim
Rush, both capable performers,
though considerably under par as
measured by the talents of Dave
Rankin, All-American, ’41. Or Mal
Elwards, Notre Dame, ’15.

Senior tackles “Pete” Timper-
inan and Italo Rossi are big, fast,
and tough. Rossi breaks the scales
at 225 while Timperman goes a
mere 2L5.

A“nd these two behemoths are
so fast they're used on "‘tackle-
arouiid” plays, it says here.

Purdue guards and co-captains,
Jim Miller and Tom Melton, says
the Purdue publicity, “specialize
in knifing through the line for
tackles . . .” a most unusual thing
for guards to specialize in.

A Well-Rounded Offense
Also a. possessor of unusual
talents is Coach Elwards who
has “long been a strong believer
in a. running attack as the basis
of a well-rounded offense.”
The ‘ingenious originator of the
“Boilermaker” trademark would
be proud of that‘.

Liberal Teachers
Increase Study

Liberal teachers are responsible
for the increased learning and
studying qualities of students, re-
ported Dr. Harry M. Mason, of
the US bureau of agricultural eco-
nomics, to the American Psycho-
logical association.

A national study revealed a di-
rect ratio between the liberalism
of instructors and the learning
ability of the pupils, he further
disclosed. ! I

“Teachers with liberal opinions
not only stimulate their pupils to
have more liberal views,” said. Dr.
Mason, “but also motivate them to
read more, display more interest
in current events, and participate
in- more activities.”

Emphasizing the point that pub-
lic liberalism in the upper classes
was far behind liberalism in edu-
cation, Dr. George W. Hartman,
professor at Columbia university,

joined in the plea for educational
liberalism.

Nine Former Footballers-

Pitt has long had a reputation
for turning out ﬁne elevens and
All-American football heroes. Pitt
also has a reputation for turning
out coaches, for only Notre Dame
surpasses Pitt’s record in produc-
ing outstanding football mentors.

Nine Pitt alumni are currently
directing the des-
tinies of some of
the leading foot-
ball teams in the
country. I

Intramurals will start its fourth
year of student competition next
week’ with intramural idirector
James Potts at the helm. ‘

Back in 1927‘ the intramurals
were conﬁned to just the frater-
nity men for it was they who had
the organization. But Mr. Potts
arrived on the scene, and both the
independents and engineers were
invited to compete in the various
sports. »’

Touch football, basketball," and.

mu-shball were’the original ‘sports
in the intramural play, then ping
pong and tennis were added. The
small number of individuals com-
peting in the sports was very dis-
couraging, but as time wore on di-
rector Potts added more new
sports, and has a result morenew
students entered’ the intramural
ranks.‘ A '

Last year the intramural setup

proudly showed its best and most-

successful year since its advent for
12 sports were playedithroughout,
the three seasons, and students
were very numerous. A

Badminton Is New
This year Mr. Potts has "sche-
duled touch football, badminton,
C speedball, and paddle tennis for
the fall competition whichbegins
on Oct. 15. it

.Ba‘dminton is the only new addi-
tion this year, and is expected to
ﬁnd favor among the students.
Speedball will start its third year
of play, and should rank next to
touch football in the nwnber of
participants. ” - _

Entries for all teams except the
fraternity squads must be in Mr.
Potts’, office by Oct. 48. Then the

Minnesota - 7 Pitt - 3, 1933

The meetings with the Minne-
sota_ squad were perhaps the most
thrilling. The last time the Blue
and Gold clashed ’with the Go-
phers, the local boys took enough
pushing around to moveﬁa panzer
division all the way back to Unter
den Linden.

In 193.3, a fellow by the name
of Izzy Weinstock stepped from
hisifullback spot to kick the field
goal that provided the only Pitt
score as the Minnesotans won 7-3.

All-American Bite-Size

A year’ later, at the Stadium,
a featherweight Pitt team, with
an all-American bite-size center
of the line, I-Iartwig, Shotwell, and
Ormiston, from guard to guard
~in that order, held off the pile-
driving Midwesterners for some-
thing like fifty minutes. During
the ﬁrst three‘ quarters, ﬁrst downs
for ‘the visitors, were as scarce as
Republicans in Squirrel Hill. Much
of that, of course, was due to the
howitzer punting on second and
third downs of one Francis “Pug”

ball to the extent that when a

Director Fairley Suggests Local Business
Oakland Parking Garage Shows Decline

Harried for years by the prob-
lem of where to park, University
students last week received the
ﬁrst glimmer of hope that a solu-
tion to the vexing situation has
been found when safety director
George Fairley suggested that the
city construct a mammoth parking
garage for the Oakland district.

Describing the local situation
as “terrible,” Mr. Fairley point-
ed out that ‘other large cities have
gone into the parking business
‘and said he believed that is what
Pittsburgh should do.

Mr. Fairley’s suggestion is the
result of numerous complaints

from both University students and
ball. game-attending citizens.

In the past two years 100 boys
and girls have been arrested by
city police for charging motorists
a; fee for permission to park on
streets in the district. Damage has
frequently resulted from failure of
the motorists to pay.

Chief complaint is the prohibi-
tion of parking in the» parking
area’ adjacent to Forbes ﬁeld on
days that the Pirates are playing
at home, and the two-hour park-
ing regulations on Fifth avenue
which are usually strictly en-
forced by police.

For Past Week

Business in the Pittsburgh d-is-
trict declined sharply last week,
accordingto the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research.

Although manyllines of business .

showeddecreases, the major part
of the drop resulted from the pro-
nounced reduction in bituminous

  
 
 
 
  
  
   

coal produc-
tion. The de-
cline in coal
p r o d u c --
tion was 3 re-

flected in re-
duced electric
power outpu
and in decid
edly lower rail
and river ship-
ments.

Production in “cap’rive”‘ coal

mines was almost at'a standstill"
last week, owing to a labor dis-

pute. Production in these mines
was resumed on September 22.
Consequently, the slump in busi-
ness is expected to be temporary.
., The Bureau’s seasonally bad-
justed index of business last week
stood\ at 140.6 per‘ cent of the
1923-25 average; it was 147.0 in
the preceding week and 126.4 in-
the week ended September 21 a
year ago. _

Steel mills in this district op-
erated at 97-98 per cent of capa-
city last week, slightly lower than

in the week ended September 13;.

no change was reported in blast
furnace operations. In the cur-
rent week the steel operating rate
increased a little. Less than half
as much freight was handled on

the Monongahela river last week’

as in the preceding week; rail
shipments fell about four per
cent. Most of the decline in total
shipments resulted from reduced
tonnage of coal.
