_ broken

   

By BRIAN BALK

The campus police detective
squad is currently investigating a
burglary that took place in McCor-
mick Hall over Christmas break.

According to police reports, tele-

.vision sets, stereos and cameras were 7

stolen sometime during the three-
week vacation. Most of the thefts
occurred on the lowest ﬂoors of the
building.

“There were no visible signs of
forced entry, in any of the suites
into,” Lieutenant James
Watters of the campus police said.

Watters, however, noted that the
officer who submitted’ the burglary
report said that one door of a bur-
glarized suite was not properly
secured. “The ofﬁcer was able to
push the door open despite it's being
locked,” he said. ’

“At present, we are investigating
what work was being done in the
building and who was there during
the ‘approximate time of the break-
in,” Watters said.

The detectives are unable to deter-
mine the exact time of the burglaries
because none’ of the thefts was
reported until after the break.

According to Donovan Hughes,
director of housing and food servi-
ces, “only operating people have

. access to the residence halls.” Oper-

McCormick Thefts  

ating people are those such as the

maintenance and housekeeping

employees. ,
Hughes said that the policy on dis-

tributing pass keys requires» an ‘*

employee to sign out a key in the
morning and return it once the work
day ends. .—

“There are presently no keys
unaccounted for,” Hughes
maintained.

Housing did not lock McCormick —.

Hall until 7 or 8 p.m. Thursday, Dec.
16. At that time, Hughes said, the
building's core lock pattern was

changed to prevent residents from

re-entering the dorm.

Changing the lock patterns inall
the dormitories during the break is
standard policy, Hughes said. How-
ever, one Bruce Hall resident claims
that he was able to open the main

door of Bruce Hall during the break -

with a room key. . 7

“A go‘od many of the personnel
weren’t here over Christmas break,”
Hughes said. “But some are under

union contract and were working ‘

during the vacation."

To Hughes’ knowledge, there has
never been a housing operations
employee prosecuted for burglariz-
ing a resident's room. »

“If an employee was convicted i __
and proved guilty of stealing he .

would be subject for immediate dis-
missal.” Hughes said.

Controversial   Housing Lottery to Begin Monday

By ussue ROSS

lt’s once again that time of year,
when Pitt dorm residents start to
worry about the possibility of get-
ting a room for the next Fall Term.

The Numerical Selection Process,
or lottery, begins on Monday in
Tower A under the direction of
Robert Robinson, the assistant
director of housing.

Despite the criticisms this process
has received, Robinson said that it is
more effective than the way it was
done in the past when he was an
Four thousand
undergraduates would line up in the
Towers Lobby for applications, and
at least 2000 would go away frus-
trated and angry. ’ ,

‘‘It was a mad -house,” he said.
“That system had a lot of flaws in it,
so we looked around nationally to
come up with various solutions to
solve this problem, and one of them
was the numerical selection—the
lottery.” _

Although the selection process
starts Monday, Robinson said stu-
dents do not have to come the first
day for the selection.

“The odds of getting a good
number the first day are as good as

‘ they are on the last day," he said.

To be eligible for the lottery, stu-
dents must presently be registered as

a full-time undergraduate currently
living in the residence halls. They
cannot have senior status at the time
of the drawing or any outstanding
financial obligations. They must
also agree to abide by university
rules and regulations beginning in
September.

The number of committed beds
(for athletes on scholarships, handi-
capped students, etc.) is 743. That
means 1906 beds will be available for
the general lottery. In order to get an
application, males must pick a
number between one and 914, and
females must draw a number
between one and 992. '

Robinson said that although
some students may not receive appli-
cations that same day, they will
eventually get an application.

“A lot of people are apprehensive
about picking a bad number, when
in fact there is no such thing as a ‘bad
number’ ” he said. “Every student
who participates in the lottery,
whether they get an application right
then and there, or they go on the
waiting list, gets housing.”

After’ those that have picked a
number within the range have pro-
cessed their applications, at ﬁnal
determination will take place based
on the unchosen numbers within the
quota, and any cancellations. —

Applications will againbe issued
until the range of -numbers is filled

up, and all interested students must
have their $100 advance payment to
the cashier's office by Feb. 25 or
have the payment deferred based on
current financial aid. ’
From Feb. 28 to March I is the

“closing action” period. At that
time, it will be determined which stu-
dents out of the group have pro-
cessed their applications. If they did
not process their applications, the
_next students on the list will be given

applications. ,

7‘ Room retention and selection will
begin‘ March 9 and bidding for suites
will also take place at that time.

Faculty Assembly Searches

forAlternative to ‘Dead’PIani

University long-range
planners for a new computer sys-
tem at Pitt more or less called the
plan dead at Wednesday's
Faculty Assembly meeting_..

Paul Shepard, co-chairman of
the Senate Computer Usage
Committee, said since the Digital
Equipment Corporation did not
come through with its scheduled
new line of computers and since
there was some question as to the
feasability of a large computer
system to service everyone’s
needs at Pitt, the plan is dead.

The original plan emulated the
proposal adopted by Carnegie-
Mellon University last year in
which students and faculty
members would all have access
to computers that ran on the
same system.

‘A new plan is being sought,

based on the usage needs of the
various departments at the uni-
versity, and it is toward this end
that the Computer Usage Com-
mittee is directing its energies.

“Originally, the large central-
ized computer service was seen as
a’ transition phase to differen-
tiated computing," Shepard said.
“Since that plan has been
scrapped, we will be looking into
differentiated computing based
on an assessment of computing
needs.”

Norman Bardsley, chairman
of the, Academic Task Force,
said that the job of the task force
is to “go out to every unit of the
university and ask them what
computers should be doing for
them.” ,

Bardsley said the task force
will be organizing priorities, such

as the role computers play in
education.

“How much computer train-
ing is appropriate for students in
general, not only those specializ-
ing in computing?” he asked. ,

According to Bardsley, 1.25,
percent of the university budget‘
was spent on computing 10 years
ago, as opposed to the .78 which
is spent today.

“I think computing is more
important now than it was 10 1
years ago,” Bardsley said.

‘Shepard said representatives
from the regional campuses are ‘
also being sought for the task
force. ‘

One of the purposes of the task
force, Bardsley said, is to prove‘
to the administration» that com-
puting needs are not being met at

  The Draft Registration and Financial Aid

By DIANE LEFTKOWITZ

Draft registration. Draft resisters.
Draft -counselors. Denial of govem-
ment services to those who resist the
draft. Sounds like the 1960s, right? ..
Because of a law passed by the fed-
eral government last summer, these
may be phrases that will become
familiar around college campuses all
over the country once again.

Last summer, the federal govem-

' ment_ passed a law stating that before

a student becomes eligible for the
Guaranteed Student Loan program,
PELL Grant program, National
Direct Student Loans, Supplemental
Grants and work study, he must
prove that he has registered for the
draft. ' -

Daniel May,
Associate Director of Finan-
dal Aid

' Although Pitt is not sure how to
enforce it, Daniel May, associate
director of ﬁnancial aid at Pitt, said

‘this law, will probably be imple-

mented here next fall term.
' "Whatever happens, it is goingto
be a tremendous, burden on my
ofiice to monitor this type of activity,"
May said, adding that there are over
20,000 students at Pitt who beneﬁt
from programs to be affected. .
"I'm not wonied about students‘

protesting the law," he said. "That ‘

whole issue as far as protesting it on
moral grounds really isn't my
concern. .

"People who want to do whatever
on moral grounds and take legal
action, that's all right. I don't even
want to address the issue of whethe
it's moral or not." , ’

Already, the morality of the issue
has been addressed bythe media,
and like in the 1960s, there are myri-
ads of conﬂicting opinions.

Mary o-um,
Columnist

According to Mary O'Hara, a
columnist for The Pittsburgh Press,
the students who do not register for
the draft "are already spreading the

did not fit within ‘the quota, will be
put on the waiting list. The due date
for their applications is March 30.

Although students are not ove_r-
joyed with the system, they seem to
accept it.

C; Keith Frye, a Lothrop Hall res-
ident, said the system is the best way
to distribute the rooms.

“It’s a pretty fair system, consider-
ing the number of rooms and stu-

dents that are at Pitt,” he said.

“I think it's probably the fairest '

way to get housing,” Leslie Bennett,
a Tower A Resident said. ‘‘If I don't
get a number, I will probably move
.to an apartment.”

Tammy Kelmeckis, who lives in
Bruce Hall, said the system is unfair.

“It doesn't guarantee out-of-state .

students housing," she said. “If stu-
dents want to attend this university,
they should’ not have to worry about
housing.”

germs of mistrust and hatred for our
government, just asthey did in the
19605." :_ ~ ‘

O'Hara, in her colurnn, said that
this stipulation for receiving tax-
supported aid shows “sufﬁcient
commitment to this democratic
govemment."

"What right has any young man"to
take , aid -from a government he
refuses to defend?" O'Hara wrote.
"Such youths-who take all and give
nothing are a miserable lot, farworse
than the cowards who abandon their

' country when it needs them.

"It would be counterproductive to
help educate young men who have ,
signiﬁed that this country isn't worth
ﬁghting for."

Tim Sperry,
Draft Counselor

On the contrary, the draft resisters
are no less patriotic than those who

have registered for the draft, accord- I

ing to Tim Sperry, a draft counselor.

‘I ﬁnd it a tragedy," Speny, 27.
said. “It's completely misguided.
These are people who are standing
up for their principles. Saying ‘I don't
want to -join the army‘ doesn't mean I
don't believe in what the country
stands for."

A member of the War Resisters
League, a national paciﬁst organiza-
tion, Speny said that he believes the

ggy_emment is denyinggyouxgg peo- 

pie the right to an __e‘<’ii"rcation by
implementing this law, and that will
only create more people who can't
find a job.

"These young men are being
denied the right to an education," he
said. I'd rather spend mytaxdollars
to educate people than to teach
them how to ldll other people.

'_I'l'rese young men are taking a
positron, and they're being punished
for it. This is a country that was
founded on dissent. We seem to
forget the patriotic rhetoric of the
17705. How we have to join the
army."

Tom Taylor
Reverend

Although Reverend Tom Taylor
also said he believes that the law is
unfair, he added that violators should

be prepared to suffer the

consequences.

"It's clear that when you resist, it's
an act of civil disobedience," Taylor
said. "Then, you're breaking thelaw.’
The logic goes thatif you're going to
enter civil disobedience knowingly,
then you have to suffer the
ramiﬁcations. \

"If the government has made a
law, no matter how ridiculous or out-
landish the law is that these people

"I ﬁnd that the law for registration .

should be willing _to suffer or find ' .

There are almost a million non-

today—almost double_the number

‘"9 I0 Taylor. ‘who is also a

is a very detrimental law, particularly

to the young people in this country," .

Taylor said. _

"We have a very largestanding
army. I think we're coming close to
seeing the draft again. Everytime
we've had a draft, there's been an

amaed conﬂict Most of the time, -~

there's been a major war. -
"Just from a moral standpoint,
make our amred services any larger
than they are, you're making them
offensive. You don't need a large
standing army to make them

’ defensive."

Taylor said that it will be a very
costly project for the government to
go into each college and pull the files
of students who have signed up for
ﬁnancial aid and check them against

the names of those who have regis- _

tered for the draft "just to manipulate
the fears of those who resist."
However, if the university decides
to implement this new law, it will
undoubtedly raise some issues
around campus that will echo the
sentiments of the 19603.

Falling Short  

The Student Government Board (SGB)
has named a ﬁve-member board of directors
to head the new Commuter Association. This
group was created to replace the old Commu-
ter. Affairs Committee, which was apparently
hampered in its efforts by funding restric-
tions on SGB standing committees. _

Looking at the list of students appointed to
run the Commuter Association, it is easy to
see that SGB is concerned about funding for
the new group. On the other hand, it is almost
impossible to see that the board cares .if the
group understands’ the problems facing
commuters.

Todd DeLuca, Mark Downs and James
Shelton—the former and the current SGB
presidents and the current- chairman of the
Allocations’ Committee, respectively—
probably know more about the SGB budget
process than any three other students on
campus. No doubt the Commuter Associa-
tion will be able to exploit every loophole in
the Allocation Committee’s rules.

-The new directors, however, fall far short
of being representative of commuting stu-
dents at Pitt. Students living in fraternity

'houses—who share sqme of the problems

facing students who do not live in the dormi-
tories, including the higher costs of food and
housing——are represented in the person of
Greg Wilson, president of the Interfraternity
Council. Still, there are many students who
live farther from campus than the North
Oakland / Shadyside area. They face the
added burden, in terms of time and money, of
finding transportation to school. Who is their

representative? 

None of the directors yet ‘mentioned faces
more than a 10-minute walk to school each
day. The remaining director, Linda Haus-
man, faces no daily journey to school; Haus-
man graduated last December.

These newly appointed directors, each in
some way already connected to the student
government office, bring with them a variety
of qualiﬁcations, with one glaring exception.
None among .them personally faces some of-

the most serious problems affecting students
- who commute to Pitt. Under these circum-

stances, it is hard to tell if SGB has created a
new Commuter Association or a new
“Friends of the SGB club.”

Letters To The Editor

The Exact Opposite Is True

Dear Editor:

Mark A. Sindler has recently
written an article that appeared
in the Pitt News, “Israel’s Battle
to Survive” (Pitt News, Jan. 31,
1983), which I must contend tells
anything but the facts of the
Middle East problem.

One alleged “fact” stated by
Mr. Sindler was that peace will
never be achieved between Israel
and its Arab neighbors, therefore
justifying Israeli aggression as a
form of survival. This lacks even
the most meager amount of mor-
ality, ethics or common pru-
dence. The fact is that American
interests are the real authority in
the Middle East and nourish
Israel’s interests insofar as they
make Israel’s Zionist leaders cap-
able of waging war and exploit-
ing and coercing the Arabrstates,
namely Lebanon. (Israel receives
money from the U.S. to the tune
of seven million dollars a day).

I believe Mr. Sindler is confus-
ing the word survival with impe-

I

rialism. Israel chose the degree of
threat to her “survival” by will-
ingly waging war in which she

thrives and expands. If . Israel
cannot persude an Arab state to
do business with her, she resorts
to military means to achieve her
ends.

After the misery experienced
by the Palestinians and the death
and injury inﬂicted on thousands
of children in Lebanon, I am
appalled at the ‘tone of Mr.
Sindler’s column. Such state-
ments as “Israel made the best of
its sitution” and “showed Arafat
how to win a war by starting to
vaporize the P.L.O.” or referen-
ces to the disorganization of
government in Arab states,
which he neglects to note is
encouraged by Israel, disturbed‘
me a great deal. ’ _

The U.S. supports reactionary
Arab leaders, at a loss to the peo-
ple of those countries, to pave the
way to Arabic toleration of
Israel’s move into Lebanon.

Israel aggravated civil war in
Lebanon to suit her purposes.
Israel thrives on the Iraq-Iran
war and proﬁts from her malig-
nant role in arms exports to
repressive regimes throughout
the world.

.How can Mr. Sindler imply
that the media is biased against
Israel when the exact opposite is

- true? The Jewish establishment

in the news media uses preju-
diced cliches as a shield behind
which to reap gain over others.
How can a people claim essential
supremacy over me, then accuse
me of “anti-Semitism" when I -
attempt to refute it? .

I feel I’m objective in saying
that the Middle East situation is
just one symptom stemming
from a major crisis in capitalist
America

Other Students Should Do ‘l'he-Same  

Dear Editor: «

I would like to express my disap-
pointment in the article published
on Wednesday, Feb. 2, concerning
the Nigerian students whose tuition
has not been paid.

The United States has been in the
worst economic imbroglio since the
late 19305. Our major cities are
plagued with 20 percent unemploy-
ment and farm foreclosures rage
throughout the Midwest. Yet,
though these maladies exist, The
Pitt News chooses to write about a
handful of Nigerians whose govern-
ment has not paid their tuition.

I, too, would like the government
to pay my tuition. Before I go to
sleep each night, I say a little prayer
that President Reagan will decide to
pay for my education. But alas, each
morning I awake to find that Ronny
has yet to come through. Each term
my tuition continues to take another
substantial chunk out of my savings.

I have many friends who keep
their apartment at a cool 60 degrees
because they cannot afford high
electric bills. Others I know eat only

once a day. They are not dieting;
rather, Pitt’s tuition takes prcedence
over Giant Eagle's wares. Their
grades suffer because of this, and
their college experience is not a
happy one. Yet I see no one crying
for them.

Most people, in order to make

money, get a job. Money earned
from a job can provide books, sup-
plies and, most importantly, tuition.
Seeing how the United States will
not pay my tuition, I found a job
that pays for my education. I suggest
the Nigerians do the same.

—Page 5 .

By KATHERINE M. BEZAK _

Many cultural exchanges have

taken place between the United
States and the People’s Republic of
China since the first American table
tennis team journeyed to the Great
Wall for a few friendly games of
ping-pong with their Chinese
counterparts.

These exchanges, however, have

been one-sided, with_ the United '

States getting more than it gives;
True, Coca-Cola is now available to
the Chinese people and Charlie
Chaplin films are favorites in theat-
ers there, but the Mainland has yet
to experience Western capitalist dec-

adence to the fullest. To this end, the ‘

United States must offer the Peo-
ple's Republic something that signif-
icantly reﬂects Western culture—the

preppie look. _

The preppie look became popular
in this country several years ago
when people with low and middle
incomes decided they wished to
resemble persons in upper tax
brackets. Fashion designers, sensing
a new market, created the preppie
look, and preppyism was born.

Stalking the country in Topsider
shoes, an army of lavender and lime
green Polo and Alligator shirts
paired with khaki and plaid Ber-
muda shorts overwhelmed the
nation. From these heady begin-
nings, preppyism has settled into an
established, proﬁtable movement,
creating lifelong converts as well as
steady incomes for those involved in
the preppie industry. Since preppy.-
ism has plateaued in the U.S., now is
the time for those in the industry to

export it to another deserving
market such as China.

Since the revolution that created
the People’s Republic of China in
1949, Chinese leaders have worked
hard to create the appearance of a
classless society, and one of the ways
that they have done so is to insist
that everyone dress alike.

The preppie look will'not threaten.
this illusion because, although it will
introduce new colors, designs and
textures_, preppyism’s bland _same-
ness will acco_rrTp‘lish'the’_same pur-
pose as the drab uniforms now in
vogue on the Mainland. Surely by
now the Chinese people, from
commune worker to Politburo
member, are tired of the plain blue
tunics, baggy slacks and Chairman
Mao caps that they have been wear-

T190803 : Decade Of Choice

is

  

the New Right, women are not
vessels for procreation. Before
you run to your typewriter, let us
explain.

Sex and reproduction have
become distinct. Whether this is
good or bad is -a separate topic,
one not to be dealt with here. Our
society has progressed to a point
that has predicted a new social
order. The relationship between
women and men has been dra-
matically altered, and the “idyl—
lic” family structure of the ’50s is

no longer applicable to the ’80s.
» In fact, there can no longer be a
standardized family structure,‘
nor is there a need for one. The
women’s movement and eco-
nomic difficulties in the '70s cata-
lyzed new life options for
women; the priorities of careers
and family have shifted. One
result is that parenting is often
postponed until later in life. Part
of the excitement of the '80s is the
freedom that women and. men
have in directing their lives.

Jan. 22, the 10th anniversary
df Roe v. Wade, the decision
legalizing a woman’s right to
choose an abortion, is a celebra-
tion of our new directions. For a
decade, women have had the
right to express the freedom of

Contrary to the opinions of ‘

choice over their future. No
longer are women penalized for
having the ability to bear child-
ren. A woman’s value is no
longer restricted to her child-
bearing ability, as it had been for
5,000 years. Having ‘children is
now an option in our lives allow-
ing us to make parenting a care-
ful choice and allowing us to
i make certain that our children
will be wanted and loved. '
It may sound superﬂuous to
discuss parenting to most college
students, yet if abortion is made
illegal, forced parenting will
become a frightening reality—
one that will substantially alter
our lives and_ futures. Although
the argument has been made that
no one forces us to have sex, in
these times when careers often
postpone marriage until much
later, how many of us are willing
to abstain from sex until the time
we choose to marry and have
children? -Many of us came of
reproductive age during this free-
dom of choice and cannot con-
ceive of life" where such personal
decisions are made not be our-
selves but by politicians.
. During these past few years,
repeated attempts have been
made to deny women and men
this most basic of civil liberties. It

is a fact that if abortions were
crirninalized this would not stop
women from obtaining them but
would greatly increase the risk of
physical and mental damage to
thousands of vital, functioning
women.

The issue of abortion has
become so muddled with emo-
tion that a clear picture of oppos-
ing arguments is difficult to
obtain. The arguments are many
and complicated, and everyone
feels differently. Divergences
exist not only between the secu-
lar and religious communities,
but ‘ also within the religions
themselves. Organizations such
as Catholics for Free Choice
attest to this. It is as much an
infringement on religious liber-
ties as it is on civil liberties to
dictate one particular theology
to all theologies. 

We do not advocate abortion,
yet the minority’who oppose
abortion should notdictate the
majority's future.

ing for years. Surely government
seamstresses will appreciate some
variety in their work for a change.
Surely the People’s Republic will
gain a special understanding of the‘
West by adoption of the preppie
look as their own.

Because of political and cultural
differences between the U.S. and
China, preppyism will have to be
adapted somewhat to fit the needs
and wishes of the Chinese govern-
ment. Topsider hiking boots may be
designed for the Red Army, pandas
could be substituted for alligators,
and because of the more restrictive
standards ‘of dress, Polo shirts
bound for China could be fashioned
as tunics. ‘ '

Such adaptations will create a
new job in China—the __Chinese

preppie fashion designer. It will be a

party member in good standing, of '

course, and he or she will work
closely with American preppie
designers, yet will bestow preppyism
with a politically correct and distinc-
tively Chinese appearance.

In order to further cultural
exchanges, Chinese and American
officials should immediately begin
negotiations on the import-of prep-
pyism into the People’s Republic of
China. Not only will this serve to
strengthen good will between the
two countries and allow the masses
variety in -their style while keeping
the class‘ boundaries blurred, it will
allow preppies in the U.S. to sleep
with the satisfaction of knowing that
the cult they have created has adher-
ents in the most populous country

By CHRISTOPHER

Bedroom Farce, which opened
last week at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse’s Craft Street Thea-
tre, has a lot going for it. First,
there's the deliciously funny
script by Alan Ayckbourn.
Ayckbourn has frequently been
called the British Neil Simon,
but the comparison doesn't do
him justice. Ayckbou’rn's satiri-
cal scalpel cuts far closer to the
quick than Simon's thrusts, and
he has a far greater sense of
theatrical playfulness. Like any
good farce, Bedroom's plot defies
synopsis. Suffice it to say that,
set in three separate bedrooms,
it involves the complex interac-
tion among four married cou-
ples whose lives and loves are
delightfully intertwined.

There is some fine design

work contributed by Eileen
Garrigan (set) and Mary M.
Turner (costumes). But best of
all, there are the actors. The
‘Playhouse has assembled what
is generally an imaginative,
energetic, and thoroughly pro-
fessional cast. ‘

William Beck and Doris Hack-
ney are deftly comic and
tediously British as Ernest and
Delia, a happy, middle-aged
couple who use their bedroom
as an extension of their dining
room. Alison Driver (a 100 per-
cent genuine, imported English-
woman) and James Prescott
generate more than their share
of fun as Malcolm and Kate.
They use their bedroom as a
sort of gameroom, indulging in
such adolescent pastimes as
hide—the-shoe, squirt'-the-
shaving-cream, and stash-
things—like-frying-pans-in-the-
bed.

But the show really belongs
to Ian and Malcolm, played bril-
liantly by Carrie Lund and Bob
Toperzer. Malcolm, incapaci-
tated by a back injury, uses his
bedroom as a combination hos-
pital room and business office;

Carrie Lund and Robert Toperzer in a scene from Bedroom Farce.

Ian uses it‘ as some place in
which she'd rathernot be (at
least with Malcolm). Lund and

. Toperzer playoff each other as

if they've worked as a team for
life, and .Toperzer's physical

comedy while essaying such,

simple tasks as retrieving a
fallen book is hilarious.

Well, that's the good stuff,
gang. Now for a big‘, big
problem—dire_ctor Lou Malan-
dra. Apparently suffering from
a not uncommon virus which
strikes directors and convinces
them that they are Olivier or
Orson Welles, Malandra has
made the fatal choice of not only
directing the show but playing
the lead role as well. The role is

room's shenanigans. In all of

Pittsburgh, I cannot imagine an
actor more unsuited for the
role.

On a very basic level, it is
utterly impossible to believe-
even for an instant——that
Malandra is an Englishman. He
looks like an Italian accountant,
wears. and outrageous green
sweater that screams "Look at
me!” and has an accent that
would be just right for Oscar in
The Odd Couple. Worse, his acting
is phony. In farce, it is abso-
lutely essential that, no matter
how outrageous a situation
becomes, the character behaves
in a logical, believable manner.
Malandra doesn't. He uses stock
gestures, mugs and—yes, let's
face it—hams his way throughva

part any good actor would vio-
late his grandmother for. His
Trevor is a black hole in a spot
that requires a star.

Because of Malandra’-s losing
battle to play Trevor he has
been unable to fulfill his prim-
ary job as a director. Bedroom fre-
quently loses pace and energy
and meanders where it should
flow. Considering the quality of
the cast, the problem has to be
dumped in Malandra’s lap.

Not much of a flaw by com- ‘
parison, the production suffers g
from illogical, unmotivated
lighting and sound effects that
seem to originate in some other
theater, just down the block.

‘ "Where the hell have you been?!
You're an hour late—I thought jour-
‘nalists were supposed to be on time!"
I Reid Paley, the lead singer (also
known as "the Mouth”) of The Five,
is leaning over the staircase railing of
the Bloomfield apartment building
where he lives, his black hair framing
a chalky white face, admonishing me
for not being on -time. Trooping
upstairs, my three companions (well,

"and Ifind the rest of the band
members stretched out in various
positions, looking slightly annoyed

(think they didn't expect a small army
of «dissection specialists turning up at
their door).

ing us suspiciously.

Uh-oh. Guess ‘what I forgot?
"You forgot it? You're an hour late,
-and you forgot the beer? I don't
believe it!" he exclaims. "We're not
doing this interview until you get the
beer!"

 

it didn't seem fair, four against one!)

'_Briani "If we culd tak likethe anials./’

and bored, dragging on cigarettes and H _

"Where's the beer?" Reid says, eye- '

  
   
 

"Well, I only have about eight dol-
lars..." I mumble.

"That's enough for cheap stuff!
The beer distributor's right across
the street. Who's going to get it?" he
asks. _

Fifteen minutes and a few beers
later, we get down to our purpose: To
Find Out Why The Five Do The
Things They Do (or, How Come
There Are Only Four Members In A
Band Called 'The Five?'). In case
you've just- come out of your lair and
don't know about The Five, here's
some background information: The
band consists of four embers (used

Tom Moran

to be five, but he bowed out)—Reid
Paley (vocals), Dave Doremus (bass),
Tom Moran (guitar) and Brian Boru
(drums); the group is about two-and-
a—half years old; they were formed
one drunken night at Danny's Pub,
held their first official practice ses-
sion in September of 1980, put out a
single ("Napalm Beach"/"Excite Me")
shortly after and have been staple
food for this town's underground
devotees ever since. Recently,

Shpgvgase, Friday,February 4, 1983‘ I

they've released a three-song EP, Act
of Contrition, on their own (no major or
independent label has ever heard of
these guys), which, they hope, will
get the band some attention from one
of the ”indies” with good national dis-
tribution. However, since putting out
records without company backing is
expensive, both releases have cost
The Five more than they made. So,
why then are they still struggling to
cut records? Vocalist Reid seems to
have an idea:

"In the fond hopes and wishes that
someday we will not have to have day
jobs and not have to worry about get-
sting "evicted for non-payment of
rent," he deadpans.

"At some point, we want the
audience to be our employers,” adds
Dave.

"We're going to keep on doing what
we're doing and get some of these
records sent out; if I could find some-
body at an independent label who has
good distribution and hustle some-
thing up—like I.R.S. and Rough
Trade’ have good distribution———we
could put out an album that would
sound like a fucker for five grand!
Christ, under five grand!" Reid
returns.

But, with the exception of their
supreme version of "Angel of the
Morning," and perhaps," "Excite Me"
from the first single, the majority of
The Five's material isn't the usual ear
candy—strange stuff, indeed. Don't
they ever worry about their accessi-
bility?

The band breaks into a chorus of
”No" 's.

"Only when we worry about being
too accessible," says Dave.

"It's not a matter of wanting to be
or not wanting to be—it's a matter of

,doing what you want to do, and if
people like it, fine. When we started,
none of us gave a fuck if anybody ever
liked it. If you say, 'we want these

people to like us,’ then you're not-

allowing yourself to grow in the way
that you can grow," Reid says. ”All

I

you're doing is pandering to peoples —

taste, and you end up cloning out by
saying, ’okay, I wanna sound like this
band or that band.’ We don't want to
sound like any band—we want to
sound like us!"

”And then you can read demogra-

phic charts and say "this is the‘

audience that's gonna listen to us and
we're gonna try to fit in there’-—
wha_t's that?" Doremus remarks.

Is there a point when you're first
starting -and you really don't know
how you sound?

Reid: ”Exactly." A I

Dave: "We still don't know how we
sound!"

"The way we are now is how" we
want to sound. We're closer than
we've ever been. But no, I don't think,
you reach a‘~certain point and then
that's the encl...you don't just stay on
the same plane," Brian says, "other-
wise, you're just going to get bored
with yourself, and if you have an
audience at that stage, well, then that
audience will get bored with you."

Does that mean that you feel that
you have a responsibility to your
audience?

"Well, how do you describe a
responsibility to an audience? As far

as to say that I'm not going to get up‘

and advocate 'go out and rape babies,’
you know..." Reid says, struggling for
words (something that doesn't
happen often, I might add). ’’I mean,
we're not setting ourselves up as role
models or anything like that, mainly
we're trying to get people to think for

themselves. But responsibility? How__

then that's fine: if it displeases some-

who, nine out of 10 time,‘will listen to .

and ’like' what they've been tol_d to
like—what has been drummed into
their brain by media, by radio, which
is a closed system now.” i

"'I mean, like the Doors, how do you
explain kids listening to the Doors
now? They're pushing it now because
it's the ultimate profit margin. They
don't have to deal with any trouble-
some bands, they don't have to go and
get tour support, they don't have to
advertise it! It's the ultimate profit
margin for record companies———that’s
why they like it, that's why there's a
huge revival!" Reid spits. ”It’s not a
coincidence that you'll listen to DVE
or any format station and, for a half-
hour, still not hear anything under
eight yearsold’ being played—it’s not
the function of radio. The function of
radio is, supposedly, to play new
things so you can decide for yourself,
but that's not what it. does. And that's '
not responsibility."

In light of how you feel about the
state of radio, would you like to see
Five music played on the radio?

”Sure. We do get about as much
airplay as any independent band in
this dying steel town. But, still, it's
the college and independent stations
who play the independent music, and
if they're not doing their job, then
that's the real shame, because we're
in a recession—people cannot. afford
to go out and buy records. There used
to be a time when the market wasn't
glutted with independents and now it
is..." Reid trails off.

"Brian picks it up. ”That might
sound confusing, first saying that we
don't care what people think of us,

. then saying that we want airplay, but

we do want airplay. We want people"
to hear us, and we still want people to’
support us.”

The Five _are known for leaving

their audiences drenched from danc-:

ing and exhausted by the intensity of:
the band's performance. But what
happens if the crowd doesn't get up
and they don't seem like they're
enjoying themselves?

Dave: "They have!" .

Tom: ”It doesn't matter."

Reid: "Fuck 'em! Then you just
make a spectacle of yourself and let

'em gape!"
The ever—calm Brian articulates it
better when he says, "yeah,

obviously, that's the best part of it—if
people are enjoying it and dancing.
But,‘still, it's how we feel that really
matters. I mean, if we get up there
and think we sounded terrible, and
people come up to us and say that
they thought we sounded great, then
that doesn't mean anything. If we're
not pleased with it, then that's what
matters.”

”And,” Dave says, ”it's really dis-
gusting ‘to hear somebody come up
and say 'hey man, great set’ when it

'was really bad!”

"And then you'll have nights when
everybody just sits there and stares at
the wall behind you, and we'll think,
'wow! we were really good tonight,’ ”
Brian adds.

Pittsburgh bands aren't known for
their popularity on the national scale
(no, Donnie Iris doesn't count). A lot
of- people have to leave this city in
order to get anywhere musically, and
a lot of others seem like they should
have (the Silencers, for example).
Since The Five has already played one
very successful New Year's Eve gig at
New York City's Pyramid Club, are
they thinking about moving their tal-
ents to another city?

Dave: "Yeah."

Tom: ”There_’s no reason_to stay__

 

 

 

Reid: Mommy was a blender.

here."

Reid: "You could be the Rolling
Stones here and die. There's no media
here. If and when we do move, it has
to be somewhere where there's
media and record companies, and that
certainly doesn't describe
Pittsburgh."

But Brian seems to be speaking for
the entire band when he says that the
local music scene isn't really any
worse than it is in a lot of cities:
”Bands aren't any worse, in fact
they're probably better here than in a

-lot of places."

Reid can't resist: ”But there's no
fucking support. It's like ’Are you
from out of town? Oh great, then
you can play here. If not, fuck you.’ ”

”In Pittsburgh, you're stuck
between the rednecks and the two or
three hundred new wave kids from
the suburbs who go to the Stanley
Showcase or to Heaven. Uurrgh! And
people wonder why I have a bad atti-
tude. Three years ago somebody
would walk up to me on Forbes
Avenue and say ‘faggot!’ and now it's
like, ‘aren't you in The Five?’ I want to
say, ’yeah, aren't you the one_ who
calledpme a faggot in Oakland three
years ago?’ ” he scoffs.

Mention the word ”image” to The
Five and they'll deny they have one,
though they will grudgingly admit
that people see them in somewhat of
a different, if not strange, light.

”I mean, we've lookedvlike this_

_ the style in which you do it.”

forever. We've been living like shit
for years—having-gall these obnox-
ious people hanging around our liv-
ing room and parties every night, and
living totally schizoid lives, and tak-
ing shit, and getting things thrown at
us and getting attacked,” Reid says,
working up a lather, "and I don't need
some ding-dong from the suburbs
showing up in his new wave shoes he
bought last week and telling me that
he's a punk!”

Brian pipes up with, ”the image is
in the eye of the beholder,” and the!
rest of the band start yelling things!
about Brian's being too nice, and a!
major clash of personalities nearly!
errupts before everyone starts mak-!
ing jokes about the whole thing and!

ple of how the band works? E

”Yeah, definitely. It's all very!
democratic—it comes from all of us.,!
We'll coerce, fight, throw tantrums,!
but it all works out,” Reid says; _'

”There’s no one person calling the?
shots, which is probably why it works
so well,” Brian adds. _

”One of the reasons we got}
together is sensibilities-—-we're all?
interested in the same ideas. The rea-;
son we put up with all of this—we see
each others every day and spend all
this time together practicing and
under all the members. See,” Reid
says finally and dramatically, ”it’s not.“

A war is ensuing as you read
this. It isn't a war using conven-

power, but it's still a dire
conflict. The goal? Obtaining
the right to be called the grea- V
test heavy metal band in. the
world. Since the unfortunate
disbanding of Led Zeppelin a

Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and
ACIDC have attempted to rise
to the throne of the heavy metal
hierarchy with explosive efforts
to their credit.

1 Yet behind these veterans of
leather and hair-raising decibels
is a. band clawing its way
through the hardships of the
recording industry, challenging
the throne with worthy
competition.

The band is Def Leppard, and
their latest album, Pyromania,
could be the means/by which

VORTEX SOUNDTRACK
Various Artists
Neutral _
The new music scene in
downtown Manhattan “is a
world unto itself; one that uses
a cross-bred system of feedback
with SoHo and Alphabet City as
coordinate points. It is a rich
stew, eclectic, diverse and
resourceful. Over the last year
or so, performers such as Laurie
Anderson and Glenn Branca
have emerged and made their
names, leading one to suspect
that activity abounds in many
areas that feed off each other
and that there are many people
humbly working that deserve
recognition, but may never get
it. I would have been happier if
Beth B. and Scott B. had
plumbed the depths of Lower
Manhattan, and brought forth
some of this undiscovered tal-
ent. The names of this disk,
although still'for the most part
unknown, ‘have been heard
fromllbefore, and this is not, in
my opinion, their best work.

‘ Nevertheless, the soundtrack

stands as a relatively cohesive
barometer of the types of things
that go on in the dark clubs and
lofts of the Lower East Side.
Some‘ of it is quite good,
working beyond its limits as
soundtrack, such as Black Box
Disco, my personal fave, proba-
bly because my favorite chan-
teuse, Lydia Lunch, is in

evidence. (Yeah, I can hear you, A

Leslie: ”Gag me with a spoon.”)
Adele Bertei, formerly of the
Contortions, writes most of the

good stuff here, in aclditionto

adding her "own keyboard
intrigues. Best of all, though, is
the smoky, sultry saxophone of
Lounge Lizard John Lurie,
which adds a sheen of decadent
mystery to these pieces. The
range is broad, going from bon-
goed funk to piano accompanied
ballad, and makes good. dinner

CUTS LIKE A KNIFE
Brian Adams

-A&M

An important variable in
whether an artist makes it in the
business of rock-n-roll is the
‘ability to look the part. Brian
Adams looks like all the young
men you see hitchhiking home

to upstate. New Yawlc at spring-

break.

This is Adams’ third album
and may be the one to shatter
such first impressions that keep
blocking the road to success.
The music here. walks a line
‘between good 'ole American
mainstream rock and the type of
faceless and emotionless droll of
AOR playlists. 4 ‘

When Adams concentrates on
the former, he puts over that
angry—romantic sound as well as
big—leaguers like Tom Petty and
John Cougar. But when he
retreats to the "auto-screech gui-
tars 3 and programmed organ
runs a la Journey or Foreigner,
the bottom falls out.

One of music's most
respected studio craftsmen—
Bob Clearmountain—shares
production credit with Adams
and in doing so, brings out the
lightly filtered, organ-based
sound of some of his biggest col-
laborations: Springsteen's
"I-Iungry Heart" and the Stone's
”Miss You."

i The album starts off hot with
"The Only One" and Stone's
sound alike "Take Me Back”
showing that Adams’ voice pos-

sesses all the prerequisite rough _

edges and raspiness needed to
fit theAmerican male rock star
mold. Beneath the guitar lines,
which remind one of Petty's Tor-
pedoes, lies the heart of the music;
the sounds of wailing organs

have a velly, velly scary one for
you tonight on Monster Chiller

Count Floyd has his own EP out,

like those two scary guys I used
to work with, Bob and Doug. It's

   

even got a Christmas song on it.
Awooooooooo!

Well, maybe it's not velly
scary, but it is funny. Of ‘course,
it still has those limited-play
qualities that most comedy
albums possess. Except, Floyd
(aka the ’burgh’s own Joe Fla-
herty) redeems this album by
nestling his humor inside four
hooky songs performed by the
Wally Hung Experience. Also,
unlike Bob 8: Doug's full——
length "hoser" effort, Count Floyd
is simply an EP that keeps its
fangs out of repetition. The
songs consist of the basic
SCTV/Count Floyd scary-
story-that-really-isn't schtick,
only set to music. There is the
"Gory Story Of Duane & Deb-
bie," and ”Reggae Christmas
Eve In Transylvania," which are
far and away the best cuts on
the EP; while "Count Floyd Is
Back” and ”Treat You Like A
Lady” are what could be consi-
dered vampire rap.

For those who are SCTV
freaks; for those who like to
howl like a wolf and say "velly
scary,” Courlt Floyd is a must. For
those who just need a laugh,
this album is worth the 4.98
bloodshed. Ar-Ar, Ow-ow-

an

Joey Davld

By MARK A. SINDLER

The 5-3-l Panther volleyball team
is weighing its chances and hoping
that it emerges from this weekend’s
competition with the odds on its

side. The only problem is, the odds .

may certainly be a liability. Coach
Ray Reilly and his squad travel to

Columbus, Ohio, for the Ohio State \

Invitational, scheduled to start

_ tomorrow evening.

 
   

' -V "i0Set up in the two six-team pool

format, the classic has Pitt matched
with Notre Dame (a club sport, not
varsity), Indiana, Fort Wayne,
Michiganand Purdue. The top four
teams from each pool advance to
semi-ﬁnal play—matches that might

see Pitt possibly avenging an earlier.

“This is a big game for us," Chip-
man said. “Lou Carnesecca saidit
best when he said ‘Pitt has eight
games in the Big East left and they
can't afford to look back at this
win.’ " '

“It’s possible that if we lose on

Saturday, that it would neutralize ——

theresults of the St. John's game."

Chipman plans to impress this
fact on his players before tomorrow
night's game. ~~

“I stressed that fact after the game
Tuesday, but the kids were probably
too excited to understand this. In
(yesterday and today's) practices, we
will stress this, since it’s - very
important. '

It's also important to win on the
road in the Big East, and if Pitt does
so tomorrow night, the Panthers will
have an advantage over theteams in

 

"I don't think you would call it
(revenge),” Reilly said after splitting
two games with OSU last week at
Penn State. “I don't think so at all——
what it will be is improvement.
We're -going to try and beat them
twice. It can be done."

Although Reilly does not neces-
sarily agree that his team suffered a
break in intensity after defeating
OSU in last weekend’s first game,
one player believes it did.

Tim Rakovan, a freshman out-
side] middle hitter from Montour
H.S., recalls that the Panthers were
not concentrating enough when
playing OSU during the second of
their two games.

“We can beat them," he said. “We
can because we came back in the

the second division of the league.
Despite the loss of forward Norman
Bailey, who was declared academi-
cally ineligible after the Pitt game,
Connecticut will have that impor-
tant home court advantage, one
which Chipman says gives the home
team eight to 10 points.

“Their campus gym is one of the
toughest places to play in the Big
East," Chipman said.

With the absence of Bailey, the
Huskies have become more of a
guard-oriented team. In the last
meeting, the guard tandem of Karl
Hobbs, Earl Kelley and Vernon Gis-
combe combined for 38 points.

“We have to take the fast break
away from Connecticut,” Chipman
said. ‘‘In order to do this, we have to
stop the guards.”

Chipman is particularly con-

David Takes His Act

By MARK A. SINDLER

If he wanted to, Panther guard
Joey David could be a movie star in
Hollywood. His "physical features
are imposing and mystical. He's got
deep-set eyes, a profile chiseled from
the Clint Eastwood mold and jet-
black hair that would do Clark
Gable proud.

However, David is not cut from
actor fabric; his skills and talents are

those of .the basketball court, play-.

ing the guard position for the
Panther basketball team.
Looking for the best players to

recruit, Coach Roy Chipman

plucked David right out of the local
grassroots area-—Upper St. Clair.
Possessing a deadly shot, David did
have the luxury of picking over Pitt,
knowing he was the top guard in the
Pittsburgh area. .

“It was rough,” he said of his deci-
sion of what school to choose.
“There were a lot of hard decisions,
including whether I would stay
home or not. But it was all sort of
ﬂattering because a lot of schools
were recruiting me.”

Indeed, David was the true blue
chipper during his upperclass days
at Upper St. Clair. Those schools
castng their ' eyes David's way
included Stanford, California,
Georgia Tech, Georgia and Har-
vard, among others.

At the time, Pitt seemed to be low
on David's list. What made him a
true believer was the . Panthers’
entrance into the Big East.

“That was the major reason,” ’

David said. “Aftergrealizing that.I

'chose Pitt out of the over 100

schools that recruited me.”

out slow. But in the second game, we
had mental breakdowns, and that's
probably because we're a young
team." ’ '

Reilly countered Rakovan, saying
that his team became lethargic.

“There were no mental breaks at
Ohiostate," he admitted. “The real
problems cam against Waterloo,
where I would say we fell into a
relaxing period. This is where the
real things occurred;.that’s where the
break in intensity showed."

True, the lack of drive displayed
by Pitt has not been a factor yet, but
low concentration by the players has
been exhibited during brief stints at
the recent Excalibur and Penn State
Invitationals. Reilly is therefore

cerned with Kelley, who has won Big
East Rookie of the Week two weeks
in a row and is averaging 18.8 points
per game in league competition.
“Kelley has taken more of a lead-
ership role since the absence of Bai-
ley," Chipman said. i .
But so have several Panthers.
Trent Johnson has emerged as the
power forward Chipman has been

‘ looking for. The senior co-captain

has eased the pressure on Clyde

_Vaughan, particularly on the

boards. Guard Billy -Culbertson,
whose foul shooting clinched the St.
John's game, has supplied the

' Panthers with some stability in the

backcourt.

“We have a different lineup in
from the last Connecticut game,”
Chipman said.

Pitt also has a different team on

Since arriving at Pitt, David is
making things happen on the court.
Saturday night, be pumped in 14
points against Providence, 12 of
them in the second half. Chipman
gave him more than the usual play-
ing time against the Friars, but it
won't become a habit. It will take
consistent scoring from David at the
guard position to convince Chipman
that he can handle the Big East
competition.

“Right now, I'm getting anywhere
from 11-20 minutes, which isn’t too
bad," he said. “I'm the first guard off
the bench, but unless George (Allen)
or Billy (Culbertson) have bad
games or should get hurt, I'll have to
wait my turn.” '

That isn't to say that David is sit-
ting back waiting for the opportun-
ity to play. It has been somewhat
frustrating for him to wait in the
wings, considering that he started
the last three years at Upper St.
Clair.

“Anyone wants to see more play-
ing time——that’s obvious,” David
said. “But I have confidence in
Coach Chipman; I'll just do what he
wants. It's just been a major differ-
ence for me coming off the bench
here." -

The adjustment to college basket-
ball was made easier when David
participated in the Homewood-
Brushton Summer League this
summer. His confidence in his
shooting ability was bolstered when
he was given the honor of participat-
ing in Pittsburgh's annual Round-
ball C1assic—a showcase for the top

- high school basketball players in the

nation.
A starter for the Pennsylvania

rance drills of hitting, blocking and
receiving to “push harder and harder
so we're ready for the rallies later
on,” Reilly said.

Reilly is still forced to juggle the
lineup in the effort to find the right
combination of. a starting six for

league, play, which starts in two
weeks.

Rakovan, who is one of the six
freshmen that has been temporarily
elevated to the first team, acknowl-
edged that when the defense dissi-
pates, the team follows right behind

It. '

“Right now, we're improving our
net play,” Rakovan said, “but when
the defense goes, well, if you're going
to do it, you're going to do it. We

team in the classic, David also man-
aged to earn WPIAL Player-Of-
The-Year honors; was named
first-team All-State selection by the
Associted Press and United Press
International; and did all this while
averaging 23.8 points per game and
10.7 rebounds in his senior year.

During most of his playing days at
USC, David was playing basketball
with a rather skimpy playing weight
of about 160 lbs. Currently he is in
the 175 lbs. range, after gaining 10-
15 lbs. over the summer. Even at his
media-guide-listed 177 lbs., David
still may not be up to the prescribed’
standards for playing guard.

“The biggest thing (the weight
gain) has helped Joey with is his
defense," Assistant ‘Coach Seth
Greenberg said. “Strength is most
important to a defensive player. He
is becoming a very good defensive
player and has been a tremendous
asset to our team.

“Now Joey can use his height and
strength. He can take the ball in the
lane now.”

David is the second in his family
line to play Pitt basketball. His
father, Sam David, played a" respect-
able game for Pitt in the 1940s.

“I started playing when I was '

around four or ﬁve years old,”
David recalled. “My dad coached at
Chartiers Valley at the time, and
whenever there was practice, I'd usu-
ally grab the ball and just shoot
around."

Although David does not have‘.
any pressure to. play up to Sam Dav-
id's standards, his father is still a big
factor in refining his skills.

The Pitt News, Friday February 4, 1983

By scon DELLETT

‘After starting the 1982-83 season
with powers Syracuse and Tennes-
see, the Lady Panther swim team
will ﬁnally have an easy meet, as it
travels to Ohio to face Kent State
today in the last dual meet of the
season.

“It shouldn't be a difficult meet,"
Coach David Belowich said. “Kent
State doesn't have that many
swimmers, and they have also had
some injury problems.”

According to Belowich, the pur-

pose of this meet is to give the fresh-

men swimming an opportunity to be
front-line performers in their events
and to experiment with people in
different events.

“I have to find the best lineup I
can ﬁeld,” he said. “We’re not going

to go crazy with the changes, instead‘

I put people where they're best
suited to perform.”-Belowich is try-
ing to find the best lineup as he must
notify the Big East of his entries on
Monday.

Pitt will be without the services of -

junior All-America swimmer Sue
Heon, who is participating for the
United States in international
competition.

“Last year, Sue missed the Prince-
ton meet during her tour of Europe,
but I was more inclined to support
someone going for the first time,”
_Belowich said.

“But since she was only going to
miss the Kent State meet, it was all
right with me for Sue to go on this
tour.”

This year, the Lady Panthers
faced some of the best teams in the
nation early in the year. The lack of
depth and the inexperience of the
incoming freshmen hurt Pitt early,
as is evidenced by their l0-5' dual-
meet record. However, the Lady
Panthers were able to rebound from
this start last weekend, defeating
West Virginia 98-50.

However, Belowich has no regrets
about the schedule. '

“Early in the season, we learned a
lot about the team,” he said. “We
were able to rise to the level of the
competition. Of course, it would
have been much better if we had won
the meets.

“The ideal schedule would be hav-
ing Kent State in the beginning of
the season and West Virginia, who
we wouldn’t have trouble beating,
yet would give the swimmers a chal-
lenge, at the end.”

Consecutive losses to LaSalle (59-
54) and West Virginia (67-46) have
evened Pitt's record at 2-2 on the
year. Despite the recent turn of
events, Panther coach Fred Lewis
remains confident.

“I’m extremely hopeful,” Lewis
said of his team's chances tonight.“I
thought we could have beaten
LaSalle and West Virginia. This

team (Pitt) is good enough to be

undefeated."
, Although Lewis is counting on a
win, he refuses to take the Bearcats

"lightly.

“We pretty much have to go with
our strongest_lineup," he said. “We.
really can’t let up atall. To win the

motivation to swim will be for them-
selves, the team and the name of
Pitt.” '

This may be the last opportunity
for some team members to qualify
for NCAA Eastern Regional and

Key performers for Pitt will be Ed

Lewis is also relying on another-

strong performance from his young
diving squad. Freshmen Mark
McCormick and Todd Mulzet were
bright spots in last week's loss to
West Virginia.

“Our divers are getting better
every week,” Lewis said. “Cincinna-

Runners Face Best Of South

By CHARLIE O'HARA

The Panther track team will make
its first appearance ever at the
annual Virginia Military Institute
(VMI) Winter Relays this weekend

against the finest competition the

South has to offer. .
There will be between 35 and 40
teams competing, with North Carol-
ina State (Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence Champs), Georgia (South East
Conference Runner-ups), VMI
(Southern Conference Champs),
0 Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina
and many of the smaller schools
from Virginia among the more pres-
tigious participants.

“The competition is excellent,”
said Pitt coach John Vasvary. “It is a
team-scored meet, and we haven't
had the opportunity to enter the

' whole team in a big meet this season.

“Everyone will have to contribute.
We can't have just the two-mile relay
team win. We will need a very com-
petitive performance from the entire

team." .
_ Vasvary says that it will take a

team total of 80 points to capture
first place. Points are given to the
top six in each event—l0 points for
first place, 8 for second, 6 forthird, 4
for fourth, 2 for fifth and l for sixth.
He said that this meet has added
importance because it is the team's
last competition before Big East
Championships on Feb. 19.

Vasvary has entered 20 of his
Panthers in 17 different events.

On the track, Rich Asberry and
Charlie Brown will run the 55-meter
dash. Roger Kingdom, Darryl She-
pherd and Joe McCall will compete

"in the 55-meter hurdles.

Brian Pollock and Rich Bader-
inwa are scheduled for the 400-meter
run, and Terry Gallagher and Mario
Joyner are entered in 500-meter run.

In the 800-meter run, Darren
Geary, an All-America, and Gar-
land Brown will represent Pitt. In
the 1,000-meter run, Todd Colas
and Mickey Rihtarchik are entered.

Bill Moorehead will run the 1,500-
meter run while John Hutchison,

‘Tom Bailey and Don DiBenedetto

will compete in the 3,000-meter run.

The Panthers will also field four
relay teams: the distance medley
team of Pat Moran, Rod Chobany,
Colas and Moorehead, the 1,600-
meter team of Baderinwa, Pollock,
Joyner and Asberry, the 3,200-meter
team of Geary, Gallagher, Brown
(Garland) and Rihtarchik and the
220-meter shuttle hurdle team of
Shepherd, McCall, Pollock and
Kingdom.

In the field, McCall and Chobany
are scheduled for the long jump.
Ralph Mitton will compete in the
triple jump.

In-the shot put, Bob Buczkowski
is entered, while Chobany will do the
pole vaulting and Kingdom the high
jumping.

It will be most interesting to see
how the Panthers as a team react to
the type of competition they will
face. Especially so, considering that,
in two weeks, the Big East cham-
pionships at Syracuse University
will test the Panthers in much the
same fashion but for much higher
stakes.

Joe Bond Leaves Domestics Behind For Wrestling

By TIM DINGER

What do you do if you want to get
out of doing‘ the housework?
According to Pitt freshman Joe
Bond, you start wrestling.

4 “When I was in first grade, my
brothers used to leave the house

. after dinner, and that left me to do
-. stuff like cleaning the‘ stairway," said

Bond. “One day my mother told me
to get out of the house, so I went
with my brothers Mike and Steve to
watch wrestling practice. I liked it,
the coach gave me some papers to

.sign. That's how I got started.”

Head coach Rande Stottlemyer is
lucky that Bond was kicked out of
the house that day. As a varsity

wrestler at Pitt, Bond has earned an _

ll-4-l record thus far as a first-year

. Panther.

“As an in—coming freshman, you
can only hope for a good year, and if
he struggles, you've just got to
understand,” Stottlemyer said. “But
Joe has come in and helped us out.
We thought he had the best potential
at that weight class (155 lbs.) in the
state. He is capable of doing better,

but he can wrestle for me any time,
and it isn't just his record, but his
approach to the sport."

Bond had a highly successful
career as a wrestler at North Alle-
gheny High School, chalking up a
I00-4-2 record. At one time, he had a
68-match win streak. His most suc-
cessful year, however, was his senior
year, in which he went 37-1, winning

the WPIAL Championships and.

becoming a state runner-up. His
accomplishments earned him a No.
6 ranking in the nation and a spot in
the Pittsburgh Press Wrestling Clas-
sic. He was one of three high school
All-America wrestlers that came to
Pitt this season.

Many athletes who had success in
high school have found adjusting to
college life tough. However, Bond
found no problems.

“A big difference is the new style
of wrestling,” he said. “There is an
all-new way of doing things. Moves
you've practiced for years and used
in high school "you ﬁnd just aren't
working now. Working out with
(Jeff) Jelic and (Doug) Haines, hav-
ing them beat up on me and showing

me my mistakes is helping me to
adjust.”

Another adjustment for Bond was
his new teammates and coaches.

“In high school, I was wrestling
against Gary (Bolin) and Kyle (Nel-
lis). They were my arch rivals; now
we're on the same team,‘I_ think we
mix well as a team. All the guys
know a lot about wrestling, which
helps me." _ ‘,

Bond said that the coaches have

also helped him to adjust, and that a

they are better than the coaches he
had before.
“I think that the coaches go along

well with the team. They make it
easy to learn and they're fair.” he
said.

Stottlemyer said he thinks Bond
fits into’ the Panther lineup well,
going after the big win for the team
while still remembering it's also an
individual sport.

“He's eager to learn from anybody
and teach anybody who asks, that
adds‘ a little extra to the team,” Stot-
tlemyer said. “He helps us mentally
and his record speaks for itself.”

Along with adjusting to a new
style and team, comes the often diffi-

cult adjustment to a new situation-‘ 

-#- 7'---. ~-- ~-— -_... ._ .,____ _. ._ ___

One day, an athlete wakes up and 

finds that his high school glory is
gone and that he has to start all over,
working his way back up. Bond
accepts his position and sets new
goals.

“In the beginning of the year, I
wanted to make the team. You've
got to set goals, one step at a time,
and. work ypourway up," he said.
“Now I want to place at. Easterns
and go to Nationals. Someday, I
want to be an All-Amercia and, if
possible, win a National
championship.” ‘

David said. “He

every once in a while, he shows me

him sometimes after a game and ask 

him how I did." '

Some reminiscing often enters '

“We've always talked about the
Doc Carlson days," David said.
“(Sam) had some great years here;
but, really, there's no pressure.... All
I hear is that I can't shoot like him."

That may not be true. David is a
consistent threat‘ with his outside
shot. And just as David is realizing
how proliﬁc he can be, the “team is
just realizing how good we can be."
He believes he will contribute in the
stretch drive, but also agrees that the
team will probably ﬁnish no better

than sixth in the conference, as was'§“E'

predicted during the pre-season.
But as David peers ‘into that

he envisions bigger and better goals

which he shoots baskets, not movies.

Garren

By CHARLIE O'HARA

With the loss of freshman Kevin
Garren, who suffered torn ligaments
recently, the (6-1) Panther gymnas-
ts may find this weekend's trip to
Temple University a particularly
rigid assignment.

“We have never beaten Temple at
Temple,” said Pitt coach Frank
D’Amico. “From what I have heard,
they have experienced quite a few
injuries this season. But somehow,

they always come up with a big per-

-. Simance against Pitt.

‘ ‘“With Garren injured, it places us
in a very vulnerable position. We
can't afford another injury, or the
season from a team standpoint will
be shot.”

With injuries becoming such a
major concern, D’Amico plans to
reduce the difficulty of many ofthe
routines. He said that a victory
would be nice, but victory at the
expense of one of his gymnasts
would not be worthwhile.

Flock has made an excellent
comeback, which has been indicated
by her performance in 1983. Last
Saturday, Flock scored her highest
collegiate all-round score of 35.7
against Georgia.

Flock started her gymnastics
career when a friend brought her to a

in.

“By the end of the practice, I was
out there on the mat trying all these
tricks. The next month, I was on the
team." Flock said.

Flock developed her talents in
Monessen, Pa., under the coaching
of Bud Gininny, the uncle and

former coach of Lady Panther coach
Donna Sanft. Under Gininny, Flock
became a Class III gymnast, the
most advanced level before a gym-
nast is considered an “elite.” Flock
has seen many changes in the sport
since she began competing.

“A back—walk-over on the beam-

used to be considered a difficult
trick. Now gymnasts do back ﬂips
without thinking twice,‘ Flock said.
“Through my experience, I have had
the opportunity to watch the sport

grow and change. It has been excit--

ing and will continue to be as long as
gymnasts“ keep inventing new and

Pittsburgh Clean City Committee, Inc.

Pittsburgh is our home.
Let’s clean house!

 

more difficult tricks.”

Flock graduated form Belle Ver-
non Area High School and received
a full scholarship offer from Pitt.
Another reason why Flock came to
Pitt was to be close to her home and
family.

Flock is a business major and is
not sure what her future holds for
her. However, she is confident that
the hard work and dedication she
has acquired from gymnastics will
help her to attack obstacles and
achieve future goals.

“Being a student-athlete is
demanding on a young person. Bab-

bie, however, has taken this chal-
lenge and developed into a ﬁnc
person, student, competitor and
team member,” said Sanft. “I am
very pleased with her development
and can see her continuing to
improve."

Now that Flock is back, nothing
can stop her. In the fall, she found
out that her sore ankles were due to
bursitis, but this has not hindered
her performance in the least.

Flock is excited to be back and.

competing once again. She said she
feels both physically and mentally
ready for this season.
