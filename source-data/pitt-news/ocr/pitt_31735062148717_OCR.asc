Student Drivers Face

New Problems Today

No-Parking Plan
Revision Wil,l Add
To Complications

The University has lost more than
it gained from the parking restric-
tions approved by the engineering
sub-committee of the Better Traffic
Cominittee at a meeting last Thurs-
day.

A newly-approved no-parking re-
striction will be enforced at the
hours when most of the University
students attend classes, from 8 to
9:30 o’clock AM and from 6:30 to 8
o’clock PM.

Concert enthusiasts, however, will
not be affected since the concerts at
.-.<;y1~ia Mosque begin at 8:30 o’clock.

Although the sub-committee
“gave back” the Univers;3't'y owned
side of Fifth avenue, they recom-

riended no-parking from 8 to 9:30
o’clock AM and 6:30 to 8 o’clock
PM on the following streets:

Both sides of Parkman avenue
from Bigelow to Lytton avenue;
both sides of Lytton avenue from
Bigelow boulevard to Parkman
avenue; both sides of Tennyson
from the Bigelow boulevard to
Parkman avenue; both sides of
Bigelow boulevard from Bayard
street to Parkman, near Schenley
high school; east side of Parkman,
65 feet north of the University
Drive to 25 feet south of the curb
west of Lytton; and the north side
of Bigel.ow from Ruskin avenue to
;O’Hara street and Parl-’.'man avenue.

According to McNeil, restrictions
were imposed because of a petition
requesting such action signed by 90
per cent of the property owners in
the area. The petition complained
that University students prevented
the use of private drives by parking
their cars in driveways.

“The only solution,” says McNeil,‘

“is for all parties concerned to get
together and work out an adequate
plan for parking on conveniently lo-
cated. side streets.”

The parking regulations are only ‘

‘suggested by the sub-committee and
must be approved by the general as-
sembly of the Better Trafﬁc com-
mittee, which meets tomorrow.

Members of the sub-committee
refused to be quoted but general
comments express the opinion that
the submitted recommendations will
be passed by the Better Traﬂic com-
mittee.

Banks Wins Prize
In Speech Contest

William Banks, C43, won second
prize of $30 in a state—wide peace
oratorical contest held last Friday
at Bucknell university with his ora-
tion, “There is Always a Germany.”

The Bucknell contestant took first
prize and will be entered, with
Banks and the third prize winner
in national competition with win-
ners from other states.

Banks was the winner of Univer-
sity competition last month when
he defeated both fellow freshmen
and upperclassmen for the local
championship.

primarily a discussion group for
the problems of the women’s houses.
The plan, which broke down
when put into practice by the 12
women’s fraternities which signed
it, was aimed at withdrawal from
the political scene. It was proposed
by the retiring president, Helen

Norman Thomas Says

Present Foreign Policy

 

will Entangle U. S. r
In European War

By Paul Teske

The present foreign policy of the
government is slowly but surely
leading the United States into the
Luropean war but small minority
peace groups can aid in preventing
American intervention.

This is the opinion of Norman
Thoinas, Socialist candidate for
'_pr,esider.t and strong advocate of an
issolatioiin policy in foreign al°fairs,
wiio spoke before a student audi-
ence in the Hotel Schenley Monday
afternoon.

The forum was sponsored jointly
by the ‘W<_irnen.’s International
Leagtie for Peace and Freedom and
several. youth peace organizations.

Discussing  topic “Politics and
Peace,” Thomas stated that the
belligerents through trade conces-
sions and indirect subsidy by pur-
chasing gold would lead America in-
present policy of economic aid to
to the conflict and would result in
untold sui‘r‘.’ering and a “democracy
dead at home.”

Besides the immediate discontin-
u:>.nce of economic aid to Europe’s
warring nations, Thomas declared
that opposition to the American
policy of “imperialism” in Puerto
..ticQ and the Philippines, the pass-
age of the Ludlow amendment re-
quiring a vote of the people before

declaring war, and a practical solu-
tion to the unemployment problem
arerequisites for ,America’s staying
out of the conflict.

“The ﬁght for peace goes hand-
in-hand with the ﬁght against un-
employment,” according to Thomas
as he showed that in a recent survey
only 2% per cent of the total popu-
lation favored entrance into the
conflict, whereas over 8 per cent of
the unemployed favored the same
policy. “If only the machinery that
is in operation for destruction dur-
ing periods of war could be utilized
to solve the question of the unem-
ployed in America, the problem of
peace would be much nearer to a
solution.”

The extent of the United States’
participation in the present war
should be, according to Thomas,
“aid to the victims of war, encour-
agement of the small underground
movements for peace and justice in
Europe, and, only it absolutely nec-
essary, the mediation of a true
peace.”

“If the entrance of America into
the war should insure an Allied vic-
tory, the result could only be an-

other Versailles Treaty; there can

be no victory that can conquer war”
was Thomas’s statement regarding
the settlement. of the present war.

Enizccrsity Begins Constriictioa.
Qt Tiithuanian Nationality Room

Construction for the decorati.ons of
the Lithuanian room has begun and
building of the room will begin as
soon as the semester ends, announc-
ed .Pe._ter_Pi,varonas, . chairman of
the Lithuanian committee, at a
meeting of the committee in 1309
Cathedral Monday evening.

The room, which will be com-
pleted probably during the sum-
mer, will be the only nationality
room with a Wainscot of cloth pan-
cls, reveals Mrs. Ruth Crawford

Mitchell, advisor to the nationality.

I‘OOlI1S. '

The cloth was handwoven in.
Lithuania and is made of pure linen

colored and designed by threads

dipped in oak dye.

Black oak, sunk for over 100
years in the mud of a river bed and
extremely diﬂicult to purchase be-
cause of its sentimental and mone-
tary value, will border the linen.

The panels will be so constructed
that the linen may be removed and
washed.

The linen cloth, which is used for
table coverings in Lithuania, is a
contribution from the women of that
country, declares Mrs. Mitchell, and
the black oak may be attributed to
the men of Lithuania.

Ten prominent Lithuanians have
donated a piece of sculpture called
the “Mother School” by the famous
sculptor Rimsa.

The room. located next to the Ru-
manian room, will seat ﬁfteen stu-

Miller, the Critic, Comments

This Show’s No Feather in M y Cap & Gown

By Frank S. Miller
Author, “Snap Your Fingers”

Musical comedy was reborn on
the Nixon stage Monday night
when the Pitt Cap and Gown Club
gave its first performance of its
thirty-third annual production,
“Snap Your Fingers.”

Comedy was reborn, but it died
before taking two breaths, despite
the expert midwifery of the cast
and chorus. The script itself was
dead, evidently by an overdose of
bad gags.

The play was unintentionally
stark drama. Not since “The
G-rapes of Wrath" has an audience
left a theatre weeping so sym-
pathetically. Probably they miss-
ed the strong, underlying motive,

the subtleties of s fire, and the’

vital issues involved.;‘

It was a play of social sig-
nificance, told in frank words. It
made your hair stand on end, your
body quiver, your
over. It was indeed, realism; but
so is a garbage can realistic.

The gags were "all "time-tested, as
nobody can deny, and the script
was badly in’ need: of a good pun
purge.

Again this yearit was the chorus

which threw a ‘life-line into the,

.,..._.

stomach turn

stream of bad gags to rescue the
principals. The boys were grimly
determined that the show should
not fail. Their determination,,with
the excellent choreography of Miss
Ruth Miller, provided the balm for
the wounds left by a badly-writ-
ten script.

The specialty dances, too, were
irreproachable, especially those of
Ed Trembath, whose grace is un-
surpassed, and Martin Schlesinger,
agile chorus leader.

Martin Fallon, the director, ob-
viously realized what limitations
were placed on him by a badly-
written script, and so worked and
re-worked his cast into extreme

pliability. He put zip where zip
would not have been achieved
otherwise.

Of the cast, the pace-setter was
Bob Osterloh, who played Profes-
sor V. Gates. His gestures, “bus-
iness.” and even his entrances were
hilarious. Clean-up men were Jack
Hoeveler, whose crackling delivery
and ad libbing proved his indepen-
dence even of the script; and J.
Karl Stark, veteran messenger and
oﬁice boy, showing that long ago he
should have been awarded better
roles. - —

Sophomores Honor
Senior Coeds Today

Shhhh! If you’re a senior coed
and if a sophomore hands . you
ﬂowers today, it’s a secret. This is
a May Day tribute, the date of
which is kept quiet.

To quote Vade Mecum,

May Day Tribute—Soph0more

Class

“Early in May, the members of
the sophomore class honor the
senior women with a. tribute of
ﬂowers. Both the form or the
tribute and the exact date are al-
ways kept secret until the day it-
self arrives.”

Every year, including leap-year,
May Day is May 1 and today is also
May 1. A tribute of ﬂowers is
usually in the form of ﬂowers.

News Staff to Meet

The editorial staff of the News
will meet at 3:30 o’clock today in
the office, 825 -Cathedral, Bob Ad-
ams, C40, editor, announces. At-
tendance is required of all staff
members.

Convincing characterizations were
turned in by Ed Hufnagle, as Corny
Fritters, whose surprising gag-
punching ability places him with
the “greats” of Cap and Gown;
Morton Reifer, as Hedy La Money,
who revealed a decided flair for
burlesque; Bill Rial, playing Co-
bina Snood, and Milt Hoffmann,
concluding a four-year career as
a wealthy dowager. A

Four of the best voices ever in a
Cap and Gown show sang five of
the best songs ever heard, proving
to be a winning combination. The
voices belonged to Dick Lambie,
romantic lead, to Dick Kay, playing
Red Digest, to Bill Morton, cast as
the fairy prince, and to Milton Mos-
kovitz. All were in ﬁne voice, and
their diction reached even the up-
per galleries.

Vested with a poorly-written
part, George Hartman suffered
through two acts of the show. dy-
ing in the second by the author's
hand. It was a slow death, but not
merely as painful as that of Mer-
rill Snyder, who decoyed for the
author, thus drawing sneers to his
own innocent person.

Hawaii to the Spring Festival tea

to introduce students to numerous
customs and traditions of the South

Leis, the traditional garland of

Musical “alohas” will be offered

30: Preois of
A Year’s Work

At the end of eight months of work on the Pitt
News it is not the easiest thing in the world. to pre-
pare the editorial copy for the last time.

The News has reported and eonnuented on the
events of another busy year‘ for the l'iiivei:sit3’.
\Vit}iin the liiuitatioiis of four pages every Llloiiday,
Vveilnesdav, and Friday, we have atteuipted to re-
view events with the proper perspective.

During these eight months, the News has seen
the dail_v stream of publicity for student and fac-
ulty affairs, developments in the more important
admiiiistrative relations of the l711iversity, the love
life of Tuck Shop habitues, and student comment
on affairs outside the confines of F1’-ick Acres.
Can’t Please Everyone

"liroughout this year's work, the staff has kept
in mind the principle that it is important for the
Pitt News to be a ne,\'spaper in the true sense of
the word, not a mere bulletin board of publicity for
campus events.

News eoluinns of the paper have nee-.essai.'il_v
reflected the student and facility life of the l,iniver-
sity; editorial m.ate~ri.al has been intended to criti-
cize l,'niversi,ty affairs intelligently and to keep stu-
dents aware of important off-campus current.
events.

Like any independent newspaper, we have found.
it impossible to please everyone. But. we could not
have done our job conscientiously lvithout irritat-
ing the feelings of inany persons who have been in
the news during the year.

~Unﬁn.i.shed Business

Several of the important news events of the
year still belong in the category of unﬁnished
business for the University. The new liumanitics
curriculum is an experiment in its ﬁrst year of oper-
ation. The Board. of Trustees has not completed. its
action on the important report on the Uni.versity’s
adn1inistra.t.ion. The General Alumni Association
has not reached a. satisfactory arrangement with
the University for the selection of alumni trustees.
Pitt’s atliletic affairs are by no means settled. A
$6,000,000 building prograin reconnncnded by the
Chancellor gives prospects for future expansion.
lllayor Scully’s proposal for student. municipal in-
ternesliips should not be allowed to die. The new
University Council of faculty members should
develop into a strong and democratic, medium for
the expression of faculty sentiment on University
affairs.

Publicity — Good and Bad

The. amount of “bad publicity” for the Univer-
sity has decreased this year, perhaps because ofﬁ—
eials liave conic to realize that‘ good publicity can
come only when events are deserving of favorable
a.t.t;e-ntioii ; the best public relations men cannot
bury “skeletons .in the closet” by statements to the
press.

This year the News has continued its determin-
ation to draw a strict line between faculty advice
and censorship. \V‘e have insisted upon the neces-
sity of 1na.intaini1ig freedom of expression for news
and student opinion, cardinal ideas for any self-
respecting newspaper. Under the new Publications

Board, the way has been opened for improving a’

spirit of understanding and cooperation between
student. staffs of the publications and the admin-
istra tion .

Prospect for Next Year

The News has been operating under liandicaps,
and could proﬁt‘ much from more complete journal-
ism facilities and a better-trained staff. \Ve feel
that a certain iinproveineiit has been accomplished
this year; next year's staff, under the capable di-
rection of Rugy Aldiscrt, should be able to make
the Pitt News a good and strong newspaper for the
lllniversity.

undergraduates may be exposed to the “one-hundred
greatest books” (I-Iutchison and Adler), but they’ll
never write any great ones—if their semi-literary ma-g,

She: ‘Will you marry me?’

She: ‘But you must. It’s leap year!’ ,

Editor’s Holiday

By Alvin Malakoff V

A Fable of This Region. . A. .

Once upon a time there was a man and his family
who lived quietly on the side of a hill. One day, when
the man went hunting as he was wont to do, he wander-
ed into a pleasant ﬂat meadow.
his lunch which his wife had packed, and he bummed
a little tune because he felt so happy at being in such a
pleasant place.

Suddenly, the ground shook and flames and smoke
filled the air. The man was so frightened that he hum-
med louder and louder until he sang at the top of his
voice, for he wanted to keep his courage up. Just as
suddenly the roaring and smoke and the ﬁre stopped,
and there was a ﬁerce, ferocious dragon, only it was
fawning toward the man and balanced lightly on the
‘tip of its tongue was a brick‘ ‘or solid gold.

The man took the brick and ran home. Once there
he called all the neighbors and told them what had hap-
pened, and showed them the brick. They: all said what
a. wonderful man he must be for it was the Dragon of
the Terrible Power that he had met, and this dragon
had killed hundreds of others before him, and now he
had tamed the dragon into giving him a gold brick.

The man got up the next morning and went back and
sang in the ﬂat meadow and the dragon came bearing
a gold brick. The man took it, and the dragon turned
away, and the man sang again, being sure now that this
was the way to tame the ﬁerce animal, and the dragon
came back bearing a brick. The man did this all day.

At ‘night when he went home, he seemed changed.
But he told his family wonderful stories of what he
would do with the gold bricks, of how he would stay
at the ﬂat meadow and keep singing and the Dragon of
the Terrible Power would keep bringing bricks. Vi/'ith
these he would build a wonderful castle that they all

_mi.gbt live in and .be happy forever.

So off he went to make his castle of gold, which
would be the wonder of the country for centuries. He
sang as he built and the dragon kept bringing gold
bricks. The more the man built the more ambitious he
grew, until ﬁnally he decided he must have a high
tower of two score. ﬂoors and more. ‘

And so he began to build. Weeks and months
went by. One day his son came and said “Father may
we not come here, our house at home leaks and there is
not much growing in the garden?” But the man sent
his son away saying that the children might disturb the
dragon if they came. Then where would they get the
gold bricks?

The man built and built, and his children visited
him less and less, each time telling him that things had
grown worse at home, and begging that they might
come to stay with him. ‘ But each time he sent them
away with hard words. For he would have nothing
interfere with the gold bricks.

Finally, when the man had not seen his children for
several years, he decided to go home. For, as he told
the dragon, he was almost through, and now he must
tell his children and his wife that they must prepare to
come to live in the castle.

When he got home the house had fallen down, and
there was no one there. His neighbors came, and in
answer to his questions only called him bad names or
told him how his wife and children had starved many
years before, except two, who had run away cursing
their father forever. Finally, the neighbors drove him
away.

The man went back to the tower of gold, and called
the d1'_3g0T1- But now the man discovered he could no
longer sing. ~Not hearing the song, the dragon came
breathing ﬂame and smoke. The glare of the golden
tower caught his eye and he breathed upon it and it
melted and fell upon the man.

Over the man’s grave they chiseled these words:
“He would give his children nothing but gold b1‘iC1iS."

So, he sat down to eat”

Pitt News Receives .Daily
Dose of ‘lnformatioii’ Material

By Nancy Welter‘

If you could read over the editor’s
shoulder you would find that a great
amount of the mail he receives each
day is propaganda.

The Pitt News receives a daily
ration of “news” .t’rom Germany,
China, Finland. and Japan, together
with a lot of material from sources
closer ‘ me,

“Facts in Review,” published
weekly by the German Library of
lnformation in New York, is a mix-
ture of reprints of ofﬁcial German
documents and speeches, refutations
of English and French blue, white,
and yellow»-papers, and accounts of
how the cultural and educational
aspects of German life are carrying;
on during the war. Also, occasional
features trace the development of
Britain’s empire, describe the al-
leged slaughter of German minori-
ties in Poland after the outbreak of
the war. I

“New China Weekly News Let-
ter,” issued by China Information
service, consists mostly of letters
written from China, describing the
conditions in the war area and re-
lating the “cautious optimism” of
the people. The tone of the whole
 set, perhaps, by such statements
as, “Victory by Japan over China

_ . wouldgshake the peace of the
world for the next century and en‘-'4
danger not only Asia but also the

were printed excerpts from a book
recently published in Japan and en-
titled “Japanese-U. S. War Immi-
nent.” .

From Finland. before the out-
break of hostilities with Russia,
came “Finlandia News service” and

‘Cutting’ Rules
Vary In Colleges

' HAVERFORD, PA.—(_ ACP)———-Al-
though college and university cut
regulations vary in length and com-
plexity, the general tendency in
most is to make the subject of un-
excused class absences increasingly
a discretionary matter between stu-
dents and officials of the institution.

This is the ﬁnding of Haverford
Collcge’s Dean H. Tatnall Brown in
r.‘{uestioi_maires returned by 16 insti-
tutions.

Academic standing of the student
largely determines the degree to
which he will be entrusted with
keeping his class appointments as
he sees ﬁt.

In this respect, half of the insti-
tutions answering the question-
llaires-«Bowdoin, Wesleyan, Yale,
Williams, Princeton, Lafayette, Le-
high, and Smith—--grant special
privileges regarding classroom ab-
sences to undergraduates on a so-
called Dean’s List or Honor Roll.

The remaining eight either ex-
empt students doing honors work or
leave it up to the professor to de-
termine whether or nota member
of his class is impairing’ his cholas-
tic standing by the failure to attend
lectures.

Freshmen in order to qualify for a
Dean’s List are usually required to
score grades higher than those de-
manded of upperclassmen. ,

9 Cutting classes immediately pre-
ceding and following a vacation
wyithpug v.a1_id, excuse is forbidden
by "all 16’ institutions.“ Penalties
ran go from lowered grades and even
a failure at Swarthmore, Mount
Holyoke, and Lafayette to curtail-
ment and possible loss of cutting
privileges at Bryn Mawr.

NEW BRUl\lSWICK, N. J.\——-
(ACP)-—A refugee student in Rut-

I11 Intramural Highlight Today

The battle of the undefeated will
take place today at 4 o’clock on
Field 1 when Lou Mencllow and his
SAM cohorts oppose the strong Phi
Gamma Delta team.

This game should add mu.ch to the
old debate of whether a .strong
offense is preferable to an appar-
ently invincible pitcher and error-
less infield, since the Intramural’s
top pitcher, “Iron Man” Mendlow,
will be pitted against a murderers’
row composed 01’ Watson, Dimit,
Mansfield, Thurbon, and Edmunds.
Impressive Scoiues

Both teams have swept aside all
opposition by impressive scores. Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi

Kappa, and Kappa Sigma have
b«;»wed to the SAM team. Kappa
Sigma, Pi. Kappa Alpha, Phi Dleta
Theta, and the Phi Kaps were on
the short end 01’ the scores in the
lvijis’ games.

The once-beaten Pi Lam team
will tangle on Field 1. at 5 o’clock
with the Delta Tau Delta nine. Pi
1.-ambda Phi lost their only game
of the season to Sigma Chi and
should encounter no diﬂiculty with
the in and out Delta Tau Delta
term. The Delis canie to life last
week in beating their neighboring
rivals, the Phi Ens, but the pitching
of Pi Lam Bert Jatle should be
enough for victory.

today with a concert at the Avon-
worth high school, Ben Avon.

Highlights of the series of four
concerts will be the annual home
perfromance in Foster Memorial,
Wednesday, May 8.

This year’s club, with its coinci-
dental membership of 50 voices, had
its stazt in 1890 as a small group
made up of the glee, mandolin, and
banjo clubs. It is —now under the
direction of Theodore M. Finney,
associate professor of music appre-
ciation. ,

The club will be featured at the
New York World’s Fair in concerts

um on May 20. It will also appear
at the Sixth United Presbyterian
church, East Liberty, on May 14.

The ticket exchange for the home
concert will be open at the ground

tained at the dean of men’s office,
")1 Cathedral.

Coupon number 40 in the stu-
dent activities book may  ex-
changed for one orchestra or one
balcony seat. Book must be pre-
sented in person excepct in the case
where a man and woman wish to at-
tend together. Either one may pre-
sent both books. The book must
be presented and detached coupons

chased for one half the established
price. The one dollar orchestra
seats will be available for 50 cents
and the '75 cent balcony seats for
40 cents.

Dr. Coull Directs Designing, Rebuilding of Equipment

 Besides being able to juggle math-
ematical numbers and geometrical
figures, University engineers can
use tools with the skill of a me-
clgianic.

Q The engineers were put to work
‘recently on modernizing the chem-
ical engineering laboratory after
'sn‘early all of the standing equipment
had been torn down to‘ make way
for new apparatus. The student
workers, although under supervi-
sion of faculty members, did all the
designing and rebuilding by them-
selves, reveals Dr. Coull.

 The rstudents’ knowledge of tools
has enabled them, in a very short
time, to increase the laboratory
space in which to work by 50 per
cent.

.{ Among the various improvements

made in the laboratory, according
to Dr. Coull, is a modern heating
system which has replaced an old
American stove throwing “a ten foot
radius of heat.”

A new 35—horse power boiler will
provide a more efﬁcient supply of
steam than the old eight-horse pow-
er steam boiler “which delivered
two horse—power.”

Much of the equipment in the
laboratory was built by graduate
students working for the master’s
degree. It will never be ﬁnished,
however, claims Dr. Coull, for only
constant “reconditioning” will keep
a chemical engineering“ laboratory
modern.

Other student-constructed appar-
atus being built includes a still
which will be used in studying the
effects of distillation.

‘You Can’t Take It With You’
Cast Will Acquire New Skills

Members of Pitt Players will
graduate with more than a liberal
college education, if the cast of “You
Can’t“'Take It With You,” represents
the group. .

Several of the students have ac-
quired new skills especially for their
parts in the comedy‘ which will be
presented is May 6-and 7 at Foster
Memorial.

Alice Lewis, C42, as Essie, will

leai_j.n‘.fthe intricacies of toe-danc-, .

ing; Robert Sullivan, BA43, as Ed,
will know how to set type and play
a Xylophone; Bill McE1wain, C41,
will graduate from forward passes
and curve balls to dart throwing,
Bob Shissler, Ed-10, playing Papa
Sycamore, will have an expert

Artists over night will be Molly

pane, Ed41. They will know the
fundamentals of “oil dabbing,” de-
spite to gloomy appraisal by Allen
Gould, BA43, of their painting—-
“Conﬁdentially, it stinks.”

ADPi Convention

Seven Alpha Delta Pi members attended a province convention last

Another project still under
construction is an evaporator with
“stream-l_ined” tubing, thin walled,
and highly polished metal. It will
be capable of evaporating 150
pounds of water per hour and will
work under atmospheric pressure or
in a partial vacuum.

A series of parallel pipes, called
the heat exchanger, will be used to
study the effects of liquid flow.
From the observations, heating and
cooling equipment may be designed.

A complicated rack of pipes with
ﬁttings and valves will b.e used to
study pressure changes of liquids
caused by turns to retain a constant
flow can be determined by taking
into consideration, the number and
kinds of turns and additional pipe
structure.

American Student
Union Keeps Most
Collegians Puzzled

By Student’ Opinion Surveys ‘
of America

AUSTIN, TEX., April
though pushed into the
headlines for its alleged communis-
tic leanings, the American Student
union is known to only about one
half of the nation’s college students,
the Student Opinion Survey reveals.

However, 48 per cent of the col-
legiahswho have heard of the ASU
have received an unfavorable im-
pression of the organization.

The American Student union
made headlines from coast to coast
when it voted down a motion en-
dorsing the Finish Relief fund. The
newsmaking tendency of the organ-
ization increased over night when
the Dies committee on un-American
activities began an investigation of
the union.

Of the group that has some
knowledge of the student union, 35
per cent believe it is a front for
communists in colleges.

Missing

Inquiry Loses Pride;
Speaker Didrft Come

Inquiry Forum has been gaining
prestige this year as the best local
forum-th.at-never-has-an-audience.

Last Monday the forum was em-
barrassed; its pride was lost. The
featured speal:er didn’t show up.

Mark Shields, formerly of the
Sun-Telegraph, now nress agent for
Associated Gas & Electric, appar-
ently decidecl his scheduled speech
on the “lmnlicatio.ns of a Third
Term” had lost all of its oomph.

While Mr. Shields lulled over a
gas meter, twelve disappointed loy-
al Inquirers planned next semester’s
program, based on this semester’s
failures.

Conclusion reached at the sneak-
erless forum: “We favor continued
student interest in Inquiry Forum.”

Technicians Get
Better Positions

AUSTIN, TEXAS —— (AC?)--A
marked pick—up in employment of
technically-trained men is seen by
W. R. Woolrich, University of Texas
enigeering dean.

Opening of new jobs, an industrial
trend to expand research activity,
and a growing “personnel consci-
ousness” on the part of employers
are three factors responsible for the
increasing demand for experts, Dean
Woolrich believes.

He bases his assertion on an in-
creasing stream of requests by
ﬁrms, both in and out of Texas, for
trained college men.

“Both the University faculty and
business men of this state are be-
coming more ‘personnel minded,’ ”
he observed.

The practical application of public
speaking, rather than its theory, as
one of the most vital extra—curricu-
lar means of character development
and poise, has been developed at
Fordham for several years through
the Speakers Bureau.

Strange audiences, it is found,
place a speaker on his mettle and
bring out a self-conﬁdence which
would never be gained by intramu-
ral or intraclass discussions.

The success of the plan is evi-
denced by the fact that the bureau
this term has arranged more than
150 speaking engagements before
outside groups entirely unconnected
with the college, such as the New-
man clubs of several non—Catholic
universities and colleges, Chamber
of Commerce, Kiwanis clubs and
parish organizations.

UCLA Married Couples Learn.
Two May Live Cheaply as One

LOS ANGELES, CALIF-—(ACP)
—Four married couples on the Los
Angeles campus of the University
of California are learning that two
can live almost as cheaply as one
-—and get an education, too!

They are members of Falkirk
House, the first U. C. L. A. married
students’ cooperative dormitory. By
pooling domestic arrangements,
their savings run from $15 to $20 a
month.

Falkirk House got its start. last
September when Lee Sterling
Christie, a junior student, wanted to
get married. He didn’t know
whether or not his ﬁnances would
stand the strain, but he recognized
that his problem was unique. If he
could ﬁnd several other married
couples, they ‘could organize a ‘co-
operative dormitory. 7 

He ‘found them all right—three:

 

other couples, Mr. and Mrs. A. 
Canham, Mr. and Mrs. R. F. May-
ﬁeld, Mr. and Mrs. H. Leffert. They
rented a two-story stucco house
near the campus. The men do the
heavy work around the house and
yard while the women do the cook-
ing and cleaning. All food is. pur-
chased through the U_ c, L_ A_ (:0.
operative Housing Association. The
cost of cooperative living is about
$48 per couple each month.

The average age of the married
students is 22 years.

“During the spring‘ semester,
four other couples applied for ad-
mission in Falkirk Hall,” says
Christie, “but we didn’t have room
for ther_n. It proves that ther,e"1_<;

21 deﬁnite need for this type of-.
housing accommodations on the

campus.”

On Campus

John Marshall Club will have an
important business meeting today at
3:30 o’clock in 204 Cathedral. All
old and new members must attend.

Members of the acting unit who
have not been cast in any of the
