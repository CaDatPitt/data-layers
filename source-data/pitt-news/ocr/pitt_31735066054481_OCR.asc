Pitt officials said the University will
not have to change the way it reports violent

crime on campus despite abill signed into

law by President Clinton Wednesday.
Administrators maintain Pitt already
meets the requirements of the new law.
“For Pitt Police, [the law] is not much
of a change,” said Pitt Police Chief Deborah
Furka “We’ve already gone above and

« beyond the law previous to this one.”

Last week, Clinton signed into law the

{rrighcr Education Act of 1998, which,
‘among other things, stipulates universities
’must do a better job of reporting violent

crimes on campus in two ways.

First, all schools, public or private, that V

receive federal funding will face stiff penal-
ties if they do not maintain ‘campus police
or security logs that are open to the public.
Second, schools can no longer use the
Buckley Amendment as an excuse for
refusing to provide information about the
outcome of campus disciplinary proceed-
ings that involve crimes of violence or non-
forcible sex offenses.

. . / r . . , .

The Buckley Amendment says that

‘schools carmot release educational inforrna-
tion regarding a student his or her consent. _.

Some colleges and universities have a

tendency to hide unﬂattering campus-

crimes behind the Buckley Amendment in
order to prevent bad publicity from reach-
ing prospective students or the parents’ of
current students, said [Mark Goodman,
executive director of the Student Press Law
Center, whichis based in Arlington, Va,

The law Clinton signed last week
allows campus security to release records of
students_ found guilty of committing a
crime, supporting a 1992 change made to
the Buckley Amendment that said law-
enforcement records are not education
records. ,

“This is Congress’ effort to say [uni-
versities] can’t use [the Buckley
Amendment] as a roadblock,” said
Goodman after citing instances of colleges
channeling student criminal acts into inter-

nal disciplinary proceedings closed to the

public as a way to avoid releasing informa-
tion.

“ “Schools will not have the legal ability ‘ '

to prohibit the release of disciplinary results

,Colleges, Universities face fines if they wiihold information

A Susan Rubish—Gisler, coordinator of
Pitt’s student judicial system, said violent
‘crimes committed by Pitt students on cam-
pus are always heard in a court of law
before the Judicial Board even sees the
case. She said the Judicial Board hears
cases involving’ offenses like book theft,
alcohol-related offenses, drug offenses and
some assault cases.

“Disciplinary proceedings are. only
considered educationalrecords if the stu-
dent wasn’t arrested,” Rubish-Gisler said.
“It says that ﬂat—out in the Buckley
Amendment.” ”

Pitt has maintained a comprehensive
police log detailing campus crime for quite
some time, Furka said In Pennsylvania, all
public schools are required to abide by the
state’s open—records law. However, because
Pitt is considered a state—related institution
and not a public school, it has not had to
release as much information as it has been
providing. Pitt chose to do so, Furka said, as
a way of [ﬁghting crime on campus.

_ . At ﬁrst, cults shower new members‘
with affection, making them feel special and

unique. But as time goes on, that aﬂection
turns to fear and guilt, said cult expert
Ronald Loomis.

Loomis, the director of the American
Family Foundation and the fonner presi-
dent of the Cult Awareness Network, said
organizations such as the International
Church of Christ, the Church. of
Scientology, and the Hare Krishrras are
some of the cultic groups on Pitt’s campus.

Loomis gave his third lecture in a series '

of cult awareness workshops at local col-
leges last week. The main purpose of
Loomis’ lecture held at Pitt last Thursday,
was preventive education. ‘

He warned the group of the numerous
mind—control techniques cults employ to
dominate their members. - ‘

Loomis said cults also use methods of

ﬁnancial commitment, peer pressure and

love bombing, in which “the group initially
makes the recruited individual feel extreme-

ly special and unique” to entrap members,_

Loomis said _

Cults often employ tactics such as sleep
deprivation, diet manipulation and removal
of privacy to control members, Loomis
said. ‘ ‘

“The group does not leave you alone,”
he said.:“If you are alone, you may have
time to reﬂect upon and question the cult’s
ideals.” ‘
V Loomis said a main objective of a cult
is to replace individuality through uniform
practices. Chanting, singing, uniform dress
and the preaching of elitism are methods
they use; I .

“The cult works to replace past rela-

tionships,” he said. “They manipulate con— ’ A

trived relationships within the group.”
But the techniques cults employ are not
inherently evil, according, to‘Loomis.
‘ “Many non-cult organizations use
these techniques,” he said. “The U.S Marine
Corps, fraternities, sororities » and athletic

teams all use mind control. The difference is '

informed consent They know what is going
to happen. If cultic groups would lay it all
out, I wouldn’t be so criti‘ .” r ‘
Loomis said cults prey on people expe-
riencing turbulent times in their lives.

discuss peace agreement

James Maude
Contributing Editor

If Seamus Mallon had said four years
ago on his last trip to Pittsburgh that he and

' David Trimble would be speaking togeth-

er at a forum after a negotiated settlement,
he said someone “wou1d’ve called the
guys in the white jackets to take me away.”

But that all changed with the signing
of the Good Friday Agreement on April
10.

Mallon, the leader of the Social
Democratic Labour Party and the deputy
ﬁrst minister of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, spoke with Trimble the leader
of the Ulster Unionist Party and the ﬁrst
minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly,
to a crowd of around 600 at a forum on
Ireland at the Twentieth Century Club in
Oakland Friday. ‘

During the forum, sponsored by the
Irish Institute of Pittsburgh, Mallon and
Trimble explained how the Good Friday
Agreement was achieved and what each
side hopes it will bring.

“This agreement is personiﬁed by the
two representatives here today,” Mallon
said, “one representing Unionists and one
representing Nationalists.”

“What we have here is a clear, deter-
mined settlement amongst the people of
Northern Ireland,” said Trimble.

Northern Ireland for the Good Friday
Agreement to bring about lasting peace
and stability, according to Mallon and
Trimble. They both stressed the impor-
tance of the agreement and the example it
will set for other nations with similar polit-
ical tension.

“We are working towards making
Northern Ireland our own precious com-
modity,” said Mallon. “Let it become the
place where politicians, commentators,
scholars come to look how we solved the
type of problem that bested Ireland for so
long. We have devised a political agree-
ment that will end political violence forev-

er more.”

The most important result of the Good
Friday Agreement was the creation of the
108—member Northern Ireland Assembly
and 12-member executive committee
composed of representatives of the major
parties (Ulster Unionist Party, Social
Democratic Labour Party and Sinn Fein).
Elections for the Assembly were held June
25. .

“['The Good Friday Agreement] tack-
les inclusivity,” said Mallon. “No one can
be left out of the peace accord. No one can
be excluded from a fair share of this new
future.”

“It’s with [Tony] Blair’s government
and the Labour Party’s plans for devolu-

”Cemetery A

on the

Thursday to
protest
abortion.

   

NATAUA ROBERTS/ STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Staff Writer

Crosses symbolizing - the deaths of
aborted fetuses covered the ‘lawn in front
of the William Pitt Union patio Thursday.

The display, called the Cemetery of
Innocence, was a protest formed by the
Students for Life group. I

- The demonstration stirred less tension
than last year’s display, inciting only a ver-
bal battle between the Students for Life
and a pro—choice student. A student was
anested last year after he ran through the
cemetery uprooting crosses and breaking
them. ' ~ .
“We are here to raise awareness of the

  I

tragedy of abortion and give women infor— ,

mation on pregnancy support services if
they choose to have their child,” said
Students for Life member Kristen Panico.

But freslnnan Katie Quinlan didn’t

agree with all of what the _ group was say— »

mg.
‘ Quinlan walked up to the information
table that had pro-life brochures and pam-
phlets and criticized what the group was

doing.

“I think you guys are sick,” said
Quinlan. '

Quinlan said she did not want to com-
pletely. condemn the pro-life group, but
she expected them to be sensitive. '

“Having crosses [on the lawn] is way
tacky and extremely insensitive,” Quinlan
said. “Abortion " is not a comfortable
choice to make. It is a diﬁcult choice, and
seeing crosses isextremely traumatic for
any woman having an abortion.”

Panico replied that it is really sick that
abortion kills unborn children and that

adoption should be an alternative.
Quinlan agreed adoption is an altema-V
tive for some, but it is not an option for her
if she carmot take care of her own child.
“Your role in life is to protect and keep
this baby. I know I cannot take care of a
child right now. I hope to have kids some—
day and be a loving mom,” said Quinlan.
Quinlan, who says she.is pro—choice,
does not agree with late—term abortions or
the use of abortion for convenience. '
“I get pissed off when I hear girls say,‘
‘HI get pregnant, I will have an abortion,”

V Quinlan said. “I don’t think abortion-
, should be a form of birth control.”

I Gina Reynolds, president of Students
for Life, said she believes women have the
right to do whatever they want with their
own bodies, but she doesn’t think they
have the right to destroy another body
inside of them. ;

The Cemetery of Innocence was dis~‘
played from 8 a.m to 6 p.m Thursday. The
annual demonstration began last year
when Panico was president of Students for
Life. She said that she and the other IIl€l'l’l-1
bers wanted to be a voice for the unborn

during October’s “Respect for Life”;

month.

Few residents attend PiI1’s facilities workshop

Erin Lindeman

Staff Writer

Only about 10 people attended Pitt’s lat-
est attempt to educate the community about
its 10-year building and renovation plan and
to smooth the rift between students and
Oakland residents. ’

University officials held the workshop
for the community members to show them
what construction would take place under its
Master Facilities Plan and to unveil the
results of its transportation study.

The primary goal of the 10-year
Facilities Plan is to repair and modernize
present buildings as well as build new addi-
t_ions like a convocation center, student hous-

ing and a multipurpose academic complex.
Bob Pack, Pitt’s vice provost of acade-

mic planning, said the University began

developing the master plan in 1993 and now
estimates the cost at nearly $600 million.
But more than half of this money will be
spent renovating existing facilities.

“We had to make a signiﬁcantly greater
investment in student-life areas,” Pack said
of the plans for student housing and recre-
ation. ‘

New housing in South Oaldand and a
fraternity complex near Pitt Stadium are part
of the plan, which also includes recreation
and athletics facilities, such as the convoca-
tion center.

The Pittsburgh City Council recently

approved Pitt’s housing plan. Construction
that will create 500 new beds for students
will soon begin on Bouquet Street. -

Initially the plan called for 800 beds, but
Pack said the University is planning to make
signiﬁcant investments in the present resi-
dence halls instead He did not specify what
the improvements would be.

After the convocation center is com-
pleted, Pack said, the University will per-
form major work in Trees Hall and
Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt will also build
the multipurpose academic complex to
house the psychology and computer science
departments along with their classrooms and
laboratories.

Pack said the plan was designed to draw

students’ attention to the University and
show that the campus is extended and
accepted by the community.

“We want students to be very happy
with their school,” he said, “and not ﬁnd that
they are isolated from the community. There
should be no big walls between the commu-
nity and Pitt’s campus.”

Pack also spoke about students’ rela-
tionship with the community upon gradua-
tion.

_ ‘Their [students’] ﬁrture is one of inte-
gration,” he said. “Students need to become
productive and contributing factors in the
Oakland community.”

Pack also said "the housing plan is
designed to attract oﬂ‘-campus ﬁaternities to
campus.

Pennsylvania Hall, the building over-
looking Pitt Stadium with the “Hail to Pitt”
sign, will be demolished and replaced with
six fraternity houses and dome—eovered ten-
nis courts. The tennis courts will be accom-
panied by 65 parking spaces.

' Bob Harkins, director Parking,
Transportation, and Services, addressed
questions about parking on campus and in
Oaldand. He said he contributed to a study
that had looked at the supply and demand of
parking spaces and vehicles in the area.

The study showed that the University,
along with the University of Pittsburgh

_Medical Center, has 1,000 total parking

spaces. According to the study, there is an
excess of 600 spaces. -

“We do not need more parking,”
Harkins said. “There [are] not any plans for
the University to grow.

The plans for the convocation center
state that the building will hold 12,500 peo-
ple.

. Harkins was not concerned about park-
ing for the center. He said events will be dur-
ing off-peak hours, such as weekends and

-evenings. -

The multipurpose academic building is
slated to be built one or two years from now,

occupying a space across Bouquet Street,

from the law school.

seriously,” Furka said. “At Pitt, we have
always been safety-conscious.”

Furka said Pitt Police officers can
release information on the type of a crime;
where it occurred, with the exception of
sexual assault; the name and address of the
person arrested; the charge; and the per-
son’s aﬁiliation to Pitt. She said Pitt Police
carmot divulge the names and personal data
of victims and, sometimes, witnesses or
information on the investigation itself.

“We will not compromise an investiga-
tion for media reports,” Furka said. “This is
the case for municipalities as well as college
campuses.”

However, while violent crimes must

now be reported, property crimes and ﬁnan— -
. cial crimes, like embezzlement, do not.

Last year, fonner Student Government
Board Allocations Chairman Gerald
Klayrnan was accused of embezzling about
$4,000 from the fund that provides money
to Pitt’s numerous clubs and organizations

for yearly expenses.

Klayrnan’s embezzlement case was
heard by Pitt’s Judiciary Board The results
of the casewere never released, nor were
the names of those people involved or asso-
ciated with the case. Pitt maintains the
results cannot be disclosed without permis-
sion of the students involved

“It’s clearly wrong that someone who
is a college student gets this kind of special
treatment, whereas the results of anyone
else who committed this type of crime

would be on public record,” Goodman said
“It encourages misbehavior and inesponsi-

bility on the students’ part

“What we are going to see is Congress
saying there is much more that needs to be
done with this law,” Goodman added

Universities and colleges will face a
 ﬁne of $25,000 for each incident
of noncompliance. The U.S. Department of
Education will probably allow schools a
certain period of time to institutea campus
crime log, Goodman said. However, the
disciplinary—action provision will take

effect immediately, he said, with students
able to ask for records of incidents that
occuned anywhere from last semester to
several years ago.

While Goodman feels there is a “pretty
good possibility that we may actually see
some schools ﬁned for noncompliance,” he
thinks Congress must keep its eye on the
Department of Education to make sure
enforcement of the law is indeed occurring.

“The Department of Education has
shown absolutely no interest in enforcing
crime—reporting requirements,” he said.
“The only time they have done it is when
Congress has threatened them to do it”

According to the General Accounting
Oﬂice, 63 institutions of higher education
were in violation of crime—reporting
requirements.

“[The law] is going to mean more
information for students to make their lives
safer,” Goodman said. “It also is going to
prevent schools from abusing their systems
of justice so easily. The school is now going
to have to justify slaps on the wrist.”

HOUSING

The University will remove a 25-space
parking lot but will add 100 short-term and
metered parking spaces.

The student housing Pitt will build on
Bouquet Street also will have 200 parking
spaces.

The ﬁrst phase of the housing addi-
tions, garden—style apartments, will hold
200 beds and will open next fall. No addi-
tional parking will be put into the South
Oakland area. V

Lois Hayweiser, a former Pitt-
Titusville professor who lives on Dawson
Street, said she disapproves of the nmnber
of students in South Oakland, especially
freshmen.

Hayweiser suggested that more fami-

FROM PAGE 6

lies move into theareato create a mixture of ‘

ages in the neighborhood

, “Kids come in, and it’s their ﬁrst time
away from home,” Hayweiser said, “and
they just get crazy. Their houses are full of

tion in Wales and Scotland that devolution
in Northern Ireland was possible,” said
Trimble.

Mallon recalled that after signing the
agreement after three intense days of
negotiating, he walked outside the meeting
venue and saw two of Northern Ireland’s
most respected journalists with tears um-
ning down their cheeks. Mallon said this
emphasized the enormity of what they had
achieved.

A A “To be able to compromise is the
strongest thing a politician or political
party can "ever do,” said Mallon. “Face
[problems], understand them, then see
how we can together resolve them. I have
no doubt this agreement willchange the
face of Irish history.”

Though Mallon and Trimble did not
go into great depth about the major issues
and problems both sides still face, both
were optimistically certain that the agree-
ment would last.

“I can’t see how this agreement won’t
stic ,” said Mallon. “Ireland’s future

FROM PAGE 2

‘ depends on us sticking to the agreement. I

could think of 200 reasons why I couldn’t
agree with it. That’s the mindset we’ve got
to get away from. The issues of both
Unionists and Nationalists will not go
away. We have got to share each other’s
difficulties. That’s going to take a remark-
able shift in mindset.”

One of the Unionists’ biggest fears has
been whether the Irish Republican Army
would return to violence. A

“The question that has bedeviled
political maneuvers from 1992 "until now
is whether there has been a genuine tum-

ing away from violence by Republicans I

and a genuine turn towards. peace and
democratic means,” said Trimble.

A young woman from Belfast,
Northern Ireland, raised a question con-
cerning the futureof political prisoners in
Northern Ireland. Trimble’s'response did

not sit well with the majority of those who
attended the forum.

“First of all, let me correct your tenni-
nology,” said Trimble. “We don’t have
political prisoners. Their crimes may have
been politically motivated, but they’re still
crimes.”

Another audience member raised a
question about decommissioning of arms,
which, according to the Good Friday
Agreement, will be done over a tl1ree—year
period. Mallon stressed that “we’re not
going to create anything new if we keep
harping back -to small points. Isn’t there
something about we’ve signed a major
agreement, yet all we’re talking about is
decommissioning?”

The purpose of Mallonand Trimble’s
visit to Pittsburgh, which is one stop on a
tour of 12 cities, is to try to attract
American investors into Northern Ireland.

“We are asking for investment in
Northern Irelan ,” said Mallon. “We’re
not holding out our hands and begging.
We’re holding our heads high and asking
for the assistance we need.”

Trimble pointed out that Northern
Ireland as a region has a growth rate three
times higher than the average for’ the
United Kingdom. Formerly one of the
poorest regions, Northern Ireland has
overtaken regions in England such -as
Merseyside in gross domestic product per
capita. Trimble also pointed out several
other misconceptions people have of
Northern Ireland. »

“People have the image of Northern
Ireland as a place of violence,” he said.

. “We have the lowest crime rate for any

region in the United Kingdom.”

important social, cultural and economic
ties with Pennsylvania and that these need
to be built on. I '

“We have two things in common —
the steeliness of our people and the steeli-
ness to resolve this thing once and for all,”
he said.

s OPINIONS

One part of the Higher Education
Bill of 1998, signed into law by
President Clinton last week, stipulates
that university police must maintain
police logs and that schools can no
longer use the Buckley Amendment as
an excuse to cover up campus discipli-
nary hearings involving crimes of vio-'
lence or nonforcible sex offenses.

_ Whileweagreethisisastepinthe
right direction, it does not go far
enough.

Last year, the Buckley
Amendment, which requires a student’s
permission to release information per-
taining to his or her education, prevent-
ed the student body from hearing results
of the Judicial Board disciplinary hear-
ings involving Gerald Klayman, the for-
mer SGB Allocations Committee chair.
KlayIrIan_ was accused of embezzling
$4,000 of money provided by the stu-
dent activities fee. I

Apart from Allocations Committee
member Alfred Gaspari, none of
Klayrnan’s accused accomplices were
named By going straight to the Judicial
Board, bypassing Pitt Police, the admin-
istration was able to cover up an embar-
rassing scandal that had implications for
the whole student body.

Though some crimes involving stu-
dents last year were revealed to the
media (such as a Tri—Delta sister’s claim
of rape and the accusation that football
player Kirk McMullen assaulted frater-
nity members), there were instances in
which students deserved to know more

Emronrar.
News bill does not go far enough

than what was revealed The Klayman

scandal and the near burial of the _

McMullen incident were two instances
in which the University was quick to try
to cover things up. It took a while to
learn what happened, and in the case of
the embezzlement scandal, some of
Klayrnan’s accused accomplices have
——- aside from minor suspensions --
escaped with their reputations intact. '

Obviously, Pitt would like to keep 6

situations like that of Klayman out of
the spotlight because it is a black eye to
the University.

Students deserve to know what
goes on in Judicial Board disciplinary
hearings.‘ The board’s decisions should
be made- public. It will‘no longer be able
to keep information about violent
crimes and nonviolent sex offenses
quiet, and it is a disappointment that the
law was not extended to all crimes. That
Pitt would need a new law before it
started coming forward with ir1forrna—
tion on crimes students should know is
unfortunate.

Keeping the student body in the
dark is not the way to run a university.
Covering up may initially help Pitt look
good but only if no one ﬁnds out about
the crime. If, however, the story breaks,
the cover—up ‘will always be more
embarrassing than the actual crime
itself; witness the current presidential
scandal.

The students have a right to know
what crimes, whether minor or major,
are being committed on their campus.

Soldiers, not fetuses, preserve democracy

As a conservative, nothing offends me

more than those who dare to inﬂict strain upon
our governmental structure or spit in the face of
our prized American values. What vexes me
even more "is the fact that there are those who
cany out anarchy ‘using ‘conservatism as its
mask, thereby undermining the true conserva-
tive agenda and sending our heritage, values and
morality into a tailspin and on the road to obliv-
l0Il. .
One such organization, I am sad to say, can
be found right here at Pitt Relentless in its use
of Christian values to push forward a socialist
agenda, the group Students for Life has shown
that America will not fall due to a liberal psy-
chotic eclipse but by conservatism turning on
itself and imploding.

Thursday’s Cemetery for the Irmocent on
the lawn in front of the William Pitt Union patio
can be described only as a travesty. It is an insul
to any American soldier who lost his '
life in battle. The white crosses
remind me of the cemeteries in
Western Europe where our boys
who fought the Nazis were buried
They werepatiiots, and they died in
a blaze of glory serving their country and pro-
tecting American and Western values. How dare
Students for Life erect a “cemetery” and assert’
that fetuses did the same! '

I am against abortion, but I place the mili-

tary far higher on my list of priorities. I value the
Second Amendment over the right to life, and
while the killing of an unborn human pisses me
off, the desecration of war imagery annoys me
even more. American soldiers, not fetuses, will

I prevent America from tilting toward anarchy.
Ourrighttobeararms, nottherighttolife, will .
keep our sacred democracy intact. By erecting .

this “cemetery,” Students for Life has forgotten
how our way of life came about I
For instance, American soldiers, not fetus-
es, stormed the beaches of Normandy on June 6,
1944. George Washington led a group of patri-
ots, not fetuses, to victory over the English. Did
Texan fetuses defeat the Mexican forces? No,
Texan patriots did Students for Life blatantly

terminated by an abortion. Sounds like
Stormfront’s statistic of every homosexual hav-

ing at least 500 lovers in his or her lifetime.) But

not in a way that compromises the integrity of
military heroes slain in battle. » V
I also have a problem with Students for Lif
members themselves. My girlfriend, Tiffany,
was accosted by a member who called himself
“Paul.” (He could be one of those un-American
abortion clinic bombers, so the name might be
an an alias.) I was disturbed by the fact that Paul
was so interested in my T'1fI”any’s reproductive
organs! How dare he postulate on what my girl-
friend of tlnee years might do with anything that
goes on inside her womb! If I’d been there, I
would have pounded the little turd into ashes.
(Speaking of ashes, I’m wondering if this
“Paul” is Paul Clark, the editor in chief of The

Phoenix. If so, it’ll be worth your while to check I

out http://www.pitt. edu/~phoenix1/work/paulco
I to see how superchump Clark post-
ed a message on the Internet for all
the world to see, detailing how
Kristen Panico, under the pen name
of Cathryn Slozynski, made up a
tear-jerker of a story about a trip to
an abortion “mill.” See it before uber-asshole
Clark covers up his incompetence.)

I was at a rally about a week ago, and I saw
a member who called himself “Tony” being
very condescending to an Indian fella. I’m not
too favorable toward  but this guy
was so interested_in what Tony and Students for
Life President Gina Reynolds had to say that he
was writingdown their words! He even carried
a Bible with him to try connect with them, but
they were incredibly rude. Guess abortion issues
make some people a little cranky!

Onaﬁnalnote,I’dliketosaythatIthink
it’d be humorous (and ironic) if Paul and Tony
entered a menage-a-trois with a Swedish prosti-
tute and accidentally impregnated her. Would
they suggest she abort the fetus and forget 
about it? ;

Or would they erect a little white cross in its

Road games are
the keyto Pitt’s
resurgence

For most of this decade, Pitt was an
awful football team. Last season, the
Panthers made the huge jump from being
awful to being respectable. '

‘ Most people thought it would take
years to make that jump, but coach Walt
Harris and Athletics Director . Steve
Pederson came in and turned the program
around, and we all started seeing results a
hell of a lot sooner than we expected.

But the next jump the team needs to
make is from a respectable team to a top-25-
caliber team. If the Panthers are to do that,
they need to learn how to win on the road.

Saturday’s 29-10 loss at North Carolina
is nothing to be ashamed of. The Tar Heels
run one of the top football programs in the
country; it just happens that at 2-3, they’re
having an off year. ‘ '

They have more talent, more experi-
ence, and more depth than the Panthers.
Playing on their own ﬁeld in Kenan
Memorial Stadium just made their advan-
tage even greater. ’

Pitt’s lack of experience is a big factor

in their road woes. Most of the players on

Harris’ team were taking just their second
Division I road trip Saturday. ’

Under Hanis, Pitt is just 3-5 on the road '

comparedto a5-3 markathome. But there’s
more to the story than just numbers: It
sometimes appears the home and road
Panthers are two totally dilferent teams.

At home, Pitt can beat’ almost anyone.
It has played with every single team that has
come into Pitt stadium in the last two years,
with the exception of the 45-21 blowout at
the hands of N otre Dame last year.

Included in those ﬁve home wins are
shockers against Miami and V1rginia'Tech,
upsets that the Panthers won despite having
a less talented roster. '

Two of their three home losses are actu-

ally just as impressive as many of their wins. .

The narrow home defeats against Syracuse

last year and Penn State this year are games

that, on paper, Pitt had no business being in.

Pitt feeds and thrives off of an energetic
home crowd

But when they’re on enemy turf, the
Panthers just haven’t had that same spark
Last season Pitt, lost on the road to Temple
and Boston College. How a team that beat
Miami and Virginia Tech lost to those two
schools still perplexes me. » — ,

In another not-so-hot road performance
last year, Pitt nearly lost to a Rutgers team
that didn’t win a game all season.

The trend has continued this year. At
home, Pitt beat Vrllanova, out-played Penn

to 2-3 overall, 0-1 in the Big East.

The Panthers left all remnants of

offense that repeatedly dismantled

managed only 235 yards of total

many more scrambles and errant
passes. One of the sacks, a safety to
start the second half, pushed the
momentum pendulum from neutral to
North Carolina’s corner.

“We should never have given up

the safety. That should not happen.

....We should have thrown the ball
away,” said Harris. 3 0

‘‘That’s a bust on the quarterback
when he gets sacked in the end zone
for a safety. I gotta get rid of the ball.
That one’s on me, and it should never
have happened,” said Lytle.

Lytle’s passing performance
against Akron will quickly be forgot-
ten following his 12 of 22 effort for
133 yards, one touchdown and one
interception Saturday. He also seems
to be locked in on Latef Grim and
Terry Murphy as his receiving
options. They caught 10, of his 12

‘passes for 101 yards.

The game started seemingly well
for the ‘Panthers, as they calmly
moved the ball 26 yards to the Tar
Heel 28-yard line before Chris
Ferencik kicked a 46-yard field goal

to give Pitt the early 3-0 lead.

After that, the Pitt offense man-
aged only two more first downs in the
first half and had its best drive
abruptly halted by a Rickey
Mendenhall fumble at the -Carolina

‘ 32-yard line. , .
The Tar Heels fared much better"

on offense, using theiroving quarter-
back duo of Oscar Davenport and
Ronald Curry to pick apart the
Panther defense. ‘ _
Curry came into the game on the
third series after Davenport had trou-
ble moving the team downfield. He
immediately made an impact, scram-
bling for 7 yards on one play and run-
ning for 8 yards on the next. Another
12-yard scramble and a 20-yard pass

to Na Brown put the Tar Heels at the '

Panther 8-yard line. The Panther
defense stiffened at that point and
only relinquished the tying field goal
by Josh McGee.

“It was difficult to see them

[Curry and Davenport] come out of ‘

the pocket because we got our backs

turned to them,” said Pitt comerback 

Hank Poteat.

North Carolina would only tally.

one more field goal in the first half to
give them the 6-3 halftime lead, but at
halftime they already had 129 total
yards, including 69 of them on the
ground. That number was only 25
yards short of what Carolina was
averaging for a whole game entering
the contest. . -

What was airelatively even game
in the first half quickly changed in the
second half. First, Lytle was sacked
by Ebenezer Ekuban for a safety on
the second play of the half, and then
the Tar Heel offense went to work.

‘Oscar Davenport connected with

Na Brown for 23 yards to the Pitt 44-
yard line on the first play after the
free kick. Two plays later, Davenport
found Brown again for a 44-yard
touchdown strike to give them a 15-3
lead and practically put the game out
of reach.

“The physical part of the game is
always a factor, and today they were
way more physical than us. They got
better athletes than us right now,”
said Harris. _

The two teams would trade inter-
ceptions before Pitt would finally put
the ball in the end zone. On the score,

catch by anyone other than Murphy
and Grim, which Lytle modestly
admitted was a problem, saying, “I
hadn’t thrown to Juan in a little bit.”
Pitt continued to trail 15-10 in the
fourth quarter until North Carolina
broke the game open. A steady com-
bination of running and passing kept
Pitt’s No. 10-ranked defense off-bal-
ance all day. Rufus Brown and Deon
Dyer did the bulk of the carrying, but
it was Ronnie Robinson who plunged

The loss added to the Big East’s
nightmares about the Atlantic Coast

Piﬂ hands North Carolina a win

Jim Greif
For The Pitt News

The game was full of turnovers, mis-
cues and errors.

In the ﬁrst half, the Panthers matched
North Carolina mistake for mistake.

- As a result, Pitt was only down 6-3 at
halftime and was lucky to escape with a
deﬁcit that small.

Never mind Brandon Wlliarns’ first

fumble, which he was able to recover. You.

can also ignore Matt Lytle being thrown
back for a 9-yard loss late in the ﬁrst quarter.

. You might also want to forget Rickey

Mendenhall’s fumble that was recovered by
UNC because the Tar Heels ended up punt-
ing the ball away. None of these mistakes
really alfected the game because Carolina
played just as poorly.’

Pitt’s defense continued to play with the
same dominating style it has had all year and
held the Heels to just six points in the ﬁrst
half. Down by just three points, Pitt was still
in the game. '

The second half began with Lytle hold-
ing the ball in his own end zone. He was try-
ing to make something happen.
Unfortunately, that “something” never hap-
pened. Lytle was sacked in theend zone for
a safety to make the score 8-3 in UNC’s
favor. . _

Carolina started another drive after get-
ting ﬂie ball off a free kick. Three plays later,
Oscar Davenport found Na Brown for a 44-
yard touchdown pass to make it 15-3.

For the rest of the afternoon, the
Panthers’ problem was loose coverage.
Davenport used the lack of coverage to
begin putting the game out of reach with a
33-yard pass completion to Kory Bailey,
which led to a Ronnie Robinson rushing
touchdown that put UNC ahead 22-3.

A pair of interceptions — Lytle threw
one that was matched shortly thereafter by
UNC’s Ron Cuny — gave Pitt the ball and

injected a little life back into the Panthers. .

Five plays later, Lytle found Juan Williams,
who scored the Panthers’ only touchdown of
the day, bringing to score to 22-10.

That Pitt touchdown showed that UNC
wasn’t the only team’ that could capitalize on
mistakes. But while UNC decided to play
mistake-free football, Pitt took another route.

Pitt went three and out on the next
series, but a fumbled punt snap was returned
to the Panthers’ 9-yard line. Two plays later,
North Carolina scored again on a run by full-
back Deon Dyer, who gave the Tar Heels a
29-10 advantage. A

One reason for all the mistakes‘ could be
the pressure _ of playing on the road Pitt
could learn a valuable lesson this week, or it
could be ﬁustrated over a game where notl1-
ing went right.

Pitt must expect to make some mis-
takes because mistakes are part of football.
But if the Panthers want to win, they must be
able to look past those mistakes. As it stands,
Pitt needs to win at least one away game to
clinch a bowl spot in the highly competitive

- Big East Conference.

State, and squashed Akron. On the road,
Virginia Tech and North Carolina shut the
Panthers down. '

IfPittisto make ittoabowl garnetliis
year, it’ll more than likely have to win an
away game. There are two such contests
left: Oct. 31 at Syracuse and Nov. 19 at

The good news is that they have the
ability to win those games

Why? Because the one game that I have

A neglected to mention yet is the very best

game the team has played under Hanis. I’m
speaking of last season’s victory over West
Virginia,  a game the Panthers won on the
mad.

That game was, again, a game where
the Panthers were out-manned But the dif-
ference was that it was the ﬁrst time on the
road that Pitt showed the same ﬁght and ﬁre
that has become so characteristic of Harris-
lead teams. They ended up winning the

I game in dramatic fashion.

They showed they could do it with 

backs against the wall, but they’ve got to
play with that same ﬁre in every road game
if theywant to be a top—25 team.

Be patient, though; the Panthers are
ahead of schedule. If you asked almost any-
one two years ago where he or she expected
Pitt to be now, most would have expected
the team to still be wallowing far below the
respectable level the program is currently at.

The reassuring thing is that now, _for the

ﬁrst time in a long time, there is a sense of"
‘conﬁdence and reassurance. Walt Harris will

get us there; he won’t settle for anything less.

The only question is when the team will
take that next step. It deﬁnitely will happen-,
sooner or later, within the next few years as
Pitt lands more talented recniits and the
experience and depth grow.

But the program took that last big step
sooner than anyone expected, I so don’t be

too surprised if this next leap happens soon- -

erratherthan later.

Brian Knavish is the assistant sports editor
of The Pitt News and will be in the stands
when Pitt makes the next step.
