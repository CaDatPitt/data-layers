Blood Bank Drive Aims

the week of October 19.

During this week students are
asked to secure application blanks
and register for appointments with
the ‘American Red Cross blood
bank unit which will be on the
campus for four days, October 19,
20, 21, and 22. At least 600 names
of volunteers must be registered
before the American Red ‘Cross will
permit its expensive bl-ood bank
unit staffed by 50 doctors, nurses
and assistants to be established
here. We may be-able to persuade
them to stay for another day, ex-
plained Dr. Carlson, “if there are
enough volunteers to make it
worthwhile.” V

Application blanks may be ob-
tained at the Men’s Student
Health service, 34th floor or at
the booth on the ground floor.
Students under 21 must have the
written consent of a parent. The
bank will operate from 12 to 5
o’clock each of the four or more
days that the unit is here.

Assisting in the drive, Druids,
honorary sophomore fraternity, is
campaigning among the students
for volunteers. The fraternities
have agreed to support the drive
with 100 per cent cooperation, ac-
cording to Dr. Carlson.

Dr. Carlson praised the Univer-
sity’s initial donations of last
spring and believes that it shall
not only repeat the excellent re-
sponse but shall even better last
spring’s record.

As a result of their contribu-
tion, volunteers will in turn bene-
fit by receiving the Wasserman
test, the blood bank badge of
honor, a typing of their blood,
and a free lunch to be served by
debutantes of the Pittsburgh
Junior league.

“The need for blood donations
is apparent,” said Dr. Carlson,
“and yet there are no orders forc-
ing anyone to. give up his blood
here. This is purely voluntary,
while Germany bleeds its students
and the students of occupied coun-
tries without asking. Here is a
chance for those who yell about
regimentation and dictators to do
something about it.”

Social Events Will Continue

Today Tlrrougln Saturday

At 8:30 o’clock this morning fraternity men made their

ﬁrst individual contacts with

incoming freshman men. In-

vitations were extended to the freshmen to come to the vari-
ous houses for lunches, dinners, and a variety of events, de-
signed to ‘acquaint them with thefraternity men and Pitt

fraternity life. ' «
Rush Week will last until

2:00 o’clock Sunday morning,

at which time fraternity men will not be allowed to make
any further contacts with the new men concerning fraternity
matters. One rule which is again being emphasized this year
is that which states that no rushee may stay at any frater-

nity house over night.

One of the most important things that the freshman

should keep in mind is that he should make a point of get-

ting around to a number of the
houses and not to just one, because
in this way he will get an all
around view of the fraternities and
it will aid him further in choos-
ing the one he wants to join.

Some of the outstanding rush-

ing events include a Stage Door
Canteen party and a. Monte Car-
lo night at the PiKA house;
while Phi Gamma Delta is plan-
ning a Theater Party and a
Smoker. Delta Tau Delta will
present a Bowling Party and 21
Picnic for its rushees. Sports
Night and a Theater Party will
be the main Phi Epsilon Pi
events, whereas, a Get Acquaint-
ed night and :1 Bowling Party
top the Theta Chi rushing pro-
gram.

The Saturday night feature of
each fraternity will be a dance to
be held at the house. This dance is
the only date affair permitted dur-
ing the week. _

Applied Social Science
Library Donates Books

More than 900 books and period-
icals from the library of the School

tonio, Texas.

Carroll Reynolds, University
librarian, made the gift following
an announcement several weeks
ago that a new school of applied
service was opening there.

Dr. Graper to Speak
On Constitutional Law

Dr. Elmer Graper, professor and
head of the department of political
science will speak on “Changes in
Constitutional Law in the United
States Since 1937” at the monthly
meeting of the Social Science semi-
nar in the Faculty club tomorrow
at 1:15 o'clock.

musical, athletics, educational, and
religious materials for American
and other United Nations‘ prisoners

War lnforma tion Center

Pitt, 3. key War Information
Center, starts its fall program
with a symposium on “Civil Lib-
erties” next Monday before the
League of Women Voters of the
14th ward. Also on Monday, a dele-
gation will be sent to the Clairton
Rotary Club. The subject to be
discussed there will be “Our En-
emies.”

Because of the war, the varsity
debate team will not make the cus-
tomary barnstorming tours of the
past but will concentrate instead

Dr. C. W. Lomas, instructor in
English and faculty advisor to the
debate teams.

The program that has been
planned not only includes meet-
ings with other schools in the
district and special events before

~ Today begins fraternity rushing. The boys

‘ of the Greek letter houses go all-out to sell
. the idea of fraternity to the verdant fresh-
A-man.
They’ll not stint themselves as far as
showing you a good time. There’ll be dances
. and parties and picnics and shows—in short,
‘rush week generally manages to combine all

the features of a Roman carnival with those
’ of a crowded Babylonian market square.

But if any freshman is lured by these
alone, without sensing ﬁrst the deeper and
more signiﬁcant aspects of fraternity life,
I he will beneﬁt no fraternity, nor will his

joining beneﬁt him.

 It is not our purpose to praise or to con-
demn the fraternities. There are those in the
freshman class who can ﬁnd many hours of
pleasure and fellowship in the dances, par-
_. ties, ”bu1l sessions” that are part of frater-

nity life.

_ And there are those who woul_d be out of
place as a part of any house on campus. ‘

What each “individual freshman must try

to ﬁnd this week is whether or

belong to a fraternity. We can’t answer that
,question for you. And neither can a fast-
talking frater at a pledging dance.

_ You must decide for yourself. Inspect each
house fairly and intelligently. Try to see as
many fraternity groups as the week permits.
And then, having found’ a fraternity with
which you would want to align yourself for

the rest of your life-——join.

SOMEWHERE IN INDIA
By AN AMERICAN SOLDIER .

Today shots rang in the narrow
streets of certain quarters of this
Indian city. Hot—headed natives
hurled stones at American army
trucks. There is trouble in India;
the trouble is over the question of
Indian independence.

Certainly Indians want independ-
ence, but each Indian wants his
own brand. The Moslem wants one
kind, the Hindu another, the weal-
thy princes another, and so on.

ple, what difference does it make

In order to learn more about
this trouble, I have read as much
as possible about India, its his-

I have spoken to many Indians in
various walks of life, ranging
from the humble shop-keeperwho

This is what I have seen and

India opposed to him and his poli-

is not so.

M. A. Jinnah, a very able poli-

that independence is granted.

The Moslem League favors
“Pakistan” or division of India
into Hindu and Moslem states.
The Moslems fear they will be

affairs much more concerned about
their next meal than “Swaraj” (in-
dependence).

Should India be given independ-
ence? Yes, by all means, but not
today. A formula for independ-
ence must be carefully worked
out. Is there, then, no solution to
India’s present problems? Yes,
there is.

A temporary solution and full
Indian participation may be achiev-
ed now if certain steps are taken
immediately.

A joint declaration by the Unit-
ed States, Russia, China and Great
Britain guaranteeing full independ-
ence for India at the‘ end of the
war will cut the heart out of
Gandhi’s movement. Such a declar-
ation from England alone will no
longer suffice for the Indians. Bri-
tain has disappointed them too
often in the past.

Meanwhile greater Indian par-
ticipation in the war effort could
be obtained by granting more re.
sponsibility and key positions to
the Indians. A temporary Nation-
al Cabinet composed of Indians
could be established to function
for the duration. This Cabinet
should be permitted the exercise
of wide powers subject only to
certain limitations imposed by
military and strategic reasons.

If the Allied powers act prompt-
ly and with decision, India can still
be fully enrolled on our side
against the Axis.

 Probably the only gloomy part of the afternoon was the
"nbelievable small crowd of 12,000 that sat in the cavernous
‘leveland Municipal stadium to watch what was one of the
" op games of the day. The contest was advertised in Cleveland
"S such with the entire proceeds going to the Navy relief fund,
tut still the Ohioans would not and did not attend.
Cleveland’s answer to the small crowd was that neither
ball club was a home team, and, furthermore, Pitt was not
drawing card.
Next week the Golden Panthers play host to the Indiana
‘slam, which has thus far proven themselves threats in the
Ten conference. Advance publicity reports show the
oosiers as having one man, Billy Hillenbrand.

Sailors, Confident For Indiana Game

By ELAINE KAHN
It will be three down: and seven

to go for the-Panthers this week as '

they prepare to tackle Indiana, the
fourth foe on their ten game sched-
Jule, at the Stadium on Saturday.
The Panthers are out to even up
the record which now stands at two
losses and one lone win, but things
are looking up for the Jungle Cats.

They bounced back from a stun-
ning defeat at the hands of Minne-
sota, threw SMU for a 20-7 loss,
and, then achieved what at least
must be termed a moral victory
over highly favored Great Lakes.
Although" they lost 7-6 the Panthers
-can gain some consolation from the
fact that if they couldn’t beat them
they at least scared them to death.

But starting with Indiana on Sat-
urday things should come easier for
the Panthers. Aside from a slight
detour to‘Columbus which will in-
volve the Ohio State game, they
should be on even keel with all op-
ponents from here on in.

The story is that Pitt will again
have to concentrate on their anti-
aircraft, for Indiana has three of
the fanciest forward passers in the
Western Conference in Bill Hillen-
brand, Bob Cowan, and Jimmy
Dewar, plus some deft pass receiv-
ers in Pete Pihos, Ted Haspapes,
Bob White, Lou Saban, Chuck
Jacobs, and Earl Doloway. Hillen-
brand, Cowan, and Dewar are also
reported to be dangerous open ﬁeld
runners. '

Cowan, sophomore right halfback
leads Indiana’s rushing offensive
pwith 101 yards of net gain -in ten
trips for an average of 10 yards
per try and has tallied three of
Indiana’s 13 touchdowns. Dewar is
second in ground gaining with 86
yards in 10 trips for an average of
8.6 per trip.

This will be lndiana’s ﬁrst visit
to Pittsburgh, although head coach
Bo MacMillan is no stranger to the
district, for he once held the coach-
ing reins at Geneva College. It
was here that the Prayin’ Colonel
gained national‘ recognition when
his Covenanters engineered a sur-
prising win over Harvard away
back in 1926.

Last year was one of the worst’

forithe Hoosiers who won but two
games while losing six. However,
Indiana’s poor record is better un-
derstood in light of the fact that
Western Conference competition

. consists of such pushovers as Min-
nesota, Northwestern, Ohio State,
and Michigan. But things are al-
ready dif’f‘erent this year, a differ-
ence that is’ in no small measure due
to passer Bill Hillenbrand, who was
the outstanding sophomore half-
back of last season.

The Hoosiers opened the season
by defeating Butler College, then
thoroughly outplayed Ohio State
for three quarters before ﬁnally
bowing 32-21, and, last Saturday,
they whitewashed the Cornhuskers
from Nebraska, 12-0.

Having already equaled their
1941 win record and with one of
their best offensive teams in years,
Indiana ﬁgures to give Pitt more
than a little trouble. Furthermore,
Bo MacMillan is reported working
his team overtime in polishing the
defensive work against passes, this
being the thing which contributed
to the defeat of his team in the
Ohio State game.

All of this does not bode too well
for Pitt strategy, for in recent years
it has been the custom at Pitt to
greet all teams boasting a. ﬁne
aerial'attack with a better one,
thus beating the boys at their own
game. This will be testiﬁed to by
the SMU teams of 1938 and ’42 and

‘|K‘k<k‘l<‘k

by the Missouri team of 1940.

But there is no doubt that the,’
Panthermen, buoyed up by their fine I
showing against SMU and Great"

Lakes, will be hard to beat. In fact,
they will be very hard to beat. V .
