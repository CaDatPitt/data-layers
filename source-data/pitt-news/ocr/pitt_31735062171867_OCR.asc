sorted programs. speakers and films,

A spokesman from the People's Peace Treaty
Office stated “the program is intended to get stu-
dents to move. to. mobilize them in the May Action
in Washington beginning May 2. We want to raise
their consciousness level,“ he continued. "towards
the Peace Treaty and to discuss its future imple-

mentation."

The People's Peace Treaty is a nine point doc-
trine calling for a "peoples peace" to be establish-
ed between the Vietnames and American people. It
calls primarily for an immediate withdrawal of all
United States forces from Vietnam and the right to
selfidetermination for the Vietnames people.

The representative also mentioned that the date
for the student body referendum on the Treaty
would be set shgrtly as the required 900 signatures

have been received.

The referendum will decide whether the Treaty

HSO Plots Insurance Revision

by CAROLE COVAL

According» to Marc Hiller,
Chairman of the Health Service
Organization (HSO) Bernard K0-
bosky, Vice-Chancellor of Stu-
dent Affairs has guaranteed that
HSO will be represented re-
garding all health and health-re-
lated decision making.

HSO has already "set good
channels of communication.”Hill-
er said.

At a meeting between Kobosky.
representatives of HSO. Student
Health Directors Dr. Joseph
Hinchliffe and Allen Miller. and
William Marcus, Director of
Student Activities, on March 9.
the student insurance plan was
discussed.

“One of the prime -concerns
about insurance was the relation-
ship between the amount charg-
ed‘ and the benefits received."
Hiller said.

“Unfortunately. the university

has signed a 2-year insurance
contract with Strothman and
Mock, Inc.. but we are petition-
ing them for more far reaching
benefits for the student body in
the meantime.“ he added.

"At present, were investigating
the insurance plans of over 100
other colleges and universities
across the country. We‘re pay-
ing special attention to those
implemented by Pennsylvania
state-related universities.“

While attending the Pennsyl-
vania CollegeHealth Conference
in lhiladelphia this weekend.
Hiller toured the health service
facilities of Temple University
and the University of Pennsyl-
vania. —

"The HSO intends to make ev-
ery attempt to make the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Student Health
Service equal the tremendous
facilities at Penn and Temple."
he said.

"Student Health needs can no
longer be considered a second

  

 
  
 
 

 

“One measure that is being
planned with regard to insurance

is an on—campus student claim,

center. The HSO would like to
see a full-time student insurance
adjuster deal with anonymous in-
surance claims," Hiller said. “I
feel that a student adjuster would
be more receptive to student
claims,’ but be objective to uni-
dentified claims," he added.

MARC HILLER

The rationale for a student ad-
juster was outlined in a brief
overview of proposed HSO con-
siderations: “Students could be
employed to process claims and
answer questions. Their activi-
ties would be supervised by the
appropriate personnel.“

“This method would be much
more convenient for students.
eliminate much correspondence
by mail and telephone. and add a
more personalized atmosphere
to insurance procedures.

“The Student Health Service
would insure that the best inter-
est of the students were served.
In addition. data concerning
claims received and paid out
would become avai_lable. Heret0-
fore. this type of information has
not been obtainable in a smooth
and easy manner."

One form of student insurance
which is being considered by the

 

Health Service Organization is

   

that of a
plan.“

Supported by the American Col-
lege Health Association, the posi-
tive-enrollment plan is an agree-

Discrimination Practice~Causes Dent uror

Longhair, Cause
For Expulsion?  

by MIKE S“IMON ‘
Robert Maier, a first year den-

tal student at the University of

Pittsburgh. claims that he was
expelled from school Friday for
no other reason than his appear-
ance.

Robert Maier

Maier explained that Dr. Bark-
er. the assistant dean of the‘ Den-
talschool. "took me; out, of an

    

   
 

exam to see Dr. Forrest, the dean
of the school. Forrest then told me
‘anyone with an appearance like
yours doesn‘t belong here. you‘re
hereby expelled."

The dean was referring to
Maier‘s “alleged long and un-
washed hair and a four day beard
growth.:’7

Disputing Forrest, the student
indicated that he had washed his
hair the night before and stated
that he could not even grow a
beard in four days or have a no-
ticeable stubble. ’

Forrest. however. denied that
he had expelled Maier. “I told him
that he could come back is he
straightens out.“ stated the dean.
“We like to kick them in the ass a
little bit." he added. "but we are-
n't going to ruin their careers."

The dean also maintained that
Maier had been warned previous-
ly about his har "four or five
times.“

Despite the fact that there is no
specific dress code in the Dental
School, except that no beards are
allowed, Forrest reasoned “since
most of our patients are volun-

tary :.we cannot afford to alienate V

them due to a student’s appear-
ance. It would, deprive our stu-
dents of their much needed prac-
tical experience.”

Continuing, he added “once a
student is on his own, in his pri-
vate practice, he can do what he
pleases. However, in this dental
school he has to subscribe to what
the patients like.”

Differing with the dean’s ra-,

tionale, the student felt that his
younger patients could possible
identify with him more because of
his hair. "I‘ve seen pictures of
dental students from other

schools,” he said, “they had‘
does/A

beards and long hair, why
Pitt have to be different?”

 

SEVERAL Vietnam veterans
will speak on the People's
Peace Treaty and its imple-
mentation in the Pittsburgh
area .on Wednesday in the Stu-
dent Union. The time and place
are not yet decided.

Also, on Wednesday night in
-Tower A the veterans will hold
rap sessions. to answer ques-
tions people may have con-
cerning the Treaty.

"The Student Consultant Project
(SCP). an organization of the
Graduate School of Business. pri-
marily set up to deal and work
closely with individual business-
men towards the realization of
their goals. is now financially on
its feet according to Chairman
William Tita as a result of grants
from the University-Urban Inter-
face Program and Community Ac-
tion Pittsburgh.

Tita was adamant over the
acquisition of the grants. saying
that they would now enable the
organization to expand its boun-
daries and be able to involve
"more people from various
schools and colleges."

He went on to say that this has
been a problem with the organiza-
tion, because students had been

under the impression that it was 1 

just for graduate students in th
School of Business. A

“We owe much to our Law
School participants." Tita contin-
ued, for the services they have
performed to date and hope other
involvements will be equally bene-
ficial."

SCP has been involved in con-
ducting Bookkeeping Seminar
classes for students and also with
establishing an institution in the
organization. which would deal
with providing financial re-
sources for aiding minority busi-
nessmen. according to Tita. Im-
plementation for this. a Credit
Union has been planned for the
very near future.

The “Buy Black” committee of
SCP has been working with the
University Purchasing Depart-
ment and the University Commun-
ity Services Office to promote
purchases by the University
from black businessmen.

MR. TITA

Tita also emphasized that SCP
appreciates the need for a listing
that would indicate minimally the
number and types of black busi-
nesses in the larger Pittsburgh
area and is working towards that
end.

He reiterated that the organiza-

tion is very concerned about in-'

volving other groups of students
in their activities.

“We want to identify black
businessmen with products or
services which might be sold to
the University. To serve as a
source of information for proce-
dures and requirements of the
purchasing department and to
provide assistance to business-
men preparing bids and in other
problems arising from within the

Political Surveillmtce

The American Civil Liberties
Union l.A()LLli is sponsoring a
two year study of political sur-
veillance in the United -States.
This surveillance project is de-
veloping facts and documenta-
tion about surveillance practices.

including physical surveillance.-

wiretapping. informers. photo-
graphy and related techniques for
obtaining information about the
political activities of dissenters. I

One important phase of this
study is a survey of the college
campuses to determine the ex-
tent of these pra_ctices in Ameri-
can colleges and universities.
Since many of these practices are
clandestine, it is frequently dif-
ficult to obtain accurate data. Stu-
dents have been asked to supply
the project with answers to the
following questions and wherever
possible with relevant documents
and stories from college news-
papers.

1. Is political surveillance prac-
ticed on your campus?

2. If so, what forms does such
surveillance take?

3.‘ What institutions engage in
such surveillance practices:cam-

‘pus security police, urban intelli-

gence units. state police. FBI.
other.

4. Has the faculty become a tar-
get of surveillance? If so. in what
respects?

5. If there is evidence of stu-
dent informers on campus how
prevalent is this practice‘?

c. Are there cases in which such

d. What is the position of the

“Throughout history black wom-

Miss Noble said. pointing to the

In supporting her “strength con-

Noble recalled the ancient Egyp-

These were the most humanistic
civilizations to ever exist, she
said, and black played an integral

The formal ceremonies asso-

Gary Shaffer, president of Omi-

has been abolished because of
lack of student support.

j’Rea|tors Asserting Status
 Through Leases, Ratings

 l . by JUDY VOLLMER

  Area landlords, like their tenants, are asserting their rights as
“ugproperty holders. Through their leases, landlords determine to whom
: theyiwill rent, what regulations they will institute, and the conditions
 for lease cancellation.

 7 According to several landlords, criteria for determining who they
.. rent to are based on credit ratings, personal references, employment
j references, and sometimes, parents’ signatures.

 Some landlords, however, delve further into personality and char-
"act-er of their prospective tenants. Gold Realty decides whether or not

to rent by “going and talking to someone interested in renting,“ ac-
;}.cording to a spokesman. Daniels Realty will rent to “anyone who can
’ affordjit and has a good character. A

 “Poor credit ratings, underage, or bad references are sufficient
”’.reasons, for most proprietors, to deny someone an apartment. Howard

financially unsound, we can't possibly do business.

~ ’ j Daniel T. Mosse of Daniels Realty will refuse an apartment “if I
 think a leasee won’t fit in with the rest of the nice kids in the building.”

so In the past, students have complained to the University Housing
Office about discriminating housing practices. All of the realtors con-
i tacted by The Pitt News, however, denied that discrimination exists.

Proprietor Steven Glickman
maintained that none of the major
realtors in Pittsburgh discrim-
inate.*“I’ve heard that smaller
realties do, but I don‘t know of

97

any.

“I don’t have any idea of how
many non-whites we rent to,”
stated Howard Hanna, “because
we rent to people regardless of
color, sex, or religion.”

Huss‘ Realty claims “pretty
equal housing opportunities"
,_  _ , . . . throughout Pittsburgh, -

. L N Glickman estimates a very small percentage of black tenants in his
 holdings. “There have been more blacks in the past years than this
‘year. But if Idiscriminate, Idiscriminate in favor of blacks."

 . my Huss estimates about 50 to 55 per cent black ‘occupants, Kane about
-20 per cent and Gold, 15 per cent.

 

_ There is no legal means of breaking a lease without a reason. Most

‘ proprietors said that they haven’t had problems with lease cancella-
tion. Gold explained, “Only under violation of the terms of the lease do
we break our contract. We almost never do it."

. Kane Realty will break a lease “only if a tenant is too loud or en-

The seminar will be an all-pur-
pose sort of venture, Little em-
phasized. “This is not just a com-
plaint session to give the land-.
lords hell. We want it to be educa-
tional and have some community
dialogue, too.”

Student apathy, a continuing
complaint on the Pitt campus, is a
particular problem for Little's
group. “A questionnaire on hous-
ing appeared in The Pitt News
and we only got eight responses.
And two of them were put-ons
that we couldn’t use! ”

By its nature, the Off-Campus
Housing Committee will deal in
legal problems and is working
closely with the SA Legal Aware-
ness Committee. Tenants have
many legal rights which they are
not exercising.

“Wed like to find one really bad
situation where we can take it to
court and win." Little said. This
would give the committee a base
for student respect and coopera-
tion as well as striking some fear
into other violatin g landlords.

Students Frustrated,
Unaware of Rights

by KATHY MCCANN

The general sentiment of student tenants in Oakland about their

relationships with their landlords is one of resentful frustration. Stu-
dentsare usually unaware of their rights or simply feel that they have
none.

In conversations with six area realtors, statements were given
concerning exactly what services a tenant deserves and can expect
from his landlord.

The consensus of the realtors regarding repair work was that a stu-
dent can demand that everything be in working order. Gold Realty
stipulated that they would not accept responsibility for damage in cases
of obvious abuse. »

The realtors maintain that they acknowledge all complaints, but
promptness of repair varies with the urgency of. the problem. Work to
be done on things like electricity and plumbing take precedence over a
broken towel rack, Kane Realty commented.

Do the landlords consider the complaints of their tenants justifi-
able? For the most part, yes, they agree. Gold Realty suffers from
some “chronic complainers,” while Mosse of Daniel's Realty feels that
“kids just don’t get half-cocked.” Glick- . ‘
man Realty considers few complaints un-
reasonable and “generally we have a
good relationship with our tenants.”

The landlords expressed -a willing-
ness to hear grievances either through a
caretaker or at their offices.

Eviction in the middle of the term is
disasterous for the ousted tenant. The
conditions warranting such action on
their part were assessed by the land-
lords to be: failure to pay rent, distrub-
ing othertenants, too many people living
in the area, excessive damage, convic-
tion of a felony and any otherviolation
of the lease.

An inquiry was made to each of thevlandlords as to whether they had
ever been contacted-by any agency investigating a student concerning
crime, possession of narcotics, conspiracy. etc. Three of the land-
lords reported no such investigations. I

 

Glickman has never experiencedany drug busts on his property-

and has never reported anyone for smoking-marijuana. “I‘ve refused
to answer questions about my tenants and have often acted as attorney
for tenants who have been prosecuted."

According to Mosse, “I don’t think most of the kids use this grass
stuff. They’re just going through a transition—things will level out
when they get to be 24.”

The Secret. Service. FBI. and local police have been in touch with
Gold requesting entrance to apartments of tenants suspected of pos-
session of narcotics, said Gold. "

Gold stated that he complied with a search warrant only when the
alternative was having a door broken in.

The newly organized Off-Campus Housing Committee will prove to
be a boon, Glickman hopes. He feels that the increased communica-
tion with students will prove to them that the landlord is not necessari-
ly out to “get them.” A

-As for Mosse of Daniel's, he-assured us that “the buck is not the
important thing." ‘ - I

 Off Campus Housing Efforts Stymied by Student Apathy

A Survey to    first _ “They were nice  but not so

case and to gather the far-lacking
information on housing has been
undertaken by Alpha Phi Omega,
who so far have covered the apart-
ments on Meyran Ave. and At-
wood Sts. McKee Pl. and Dawson
St. will also be included in the
survey eventually.

Last Tuesday, a few members
of the committee were taken on
a personal tour of some McKee
Pl. apartments by Daniel Mosse.
head of Daniels Realty Co. Dan-
iels had come under some heavy
criticism on The Pitt News opin-
ion pages in columns written by
Kathy McCann. a co-chairman of
the committee who lives in one
of Daniel's apartments.

“We saw four or five of their
buildings.” Little said, “and he
pointed out the quality of the con-
struction and the furnishings. One
was being remodeled at the time
and we got to see the inside work
being done. Kathy lives in his
worst building.” '

Still, Little wasn’t (sa"tisfied;.A"

nice that the rent should be $280
a month.”

“The University hasn’t really
made a commitment to the apart-
ment problem yet,” Little em-
phasized, noting that the off-cam-
pus section of the Housing Office
has a staff of only one person,
Geri Gusmar.

The future of housing for Pitt
students remains uncertain. ac-
cording to the chairman. He’d
like to see students buying build-
ings on a co-op basis and he’d like
to see the use of University en-
dowment funds for the purchas-
ing of real estate for st.udent res-
idence, but these possibilities do
not look promising.

In closing the interview. Little
prophesized that the .off-campus
housing problem will only get
worse as time goes on. “The Uni-
versity hopes to enroll 4,000 more
new students in the next three to
four years and-the 1,200 student
Hillside dorm’ is the only“thing_to

take them. And evenjthatis if

‘Don’t Get Dressed with Light On’

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

It was April of 19§8 and Amy
and I were set to move into our
own apartment. Our parents had
told us that only bad girls live in
apartments. But we didn‘t care:
we wanted to be bad.

Annwas showing us around the
four and a half room place that we
were permanently subleting
from her and we were excited
and curious. She gave us advice
as we saw the sights.

..

You have to learn to play along
with the landlord." she advised.
starting with the bathroom in one
of the triple Thompson apart-
ments that turn the corner from
Atwood St. to Dawson. ’“It's
against fire regulations for the
bathroom to be off the kitchen like
this. But if you don‘t report him.
the landlord won‘s hassle you too
much about paying the security
deposit."

The bathroom was about four
feet wide by 10 feet long, decor-
ated by rotten wood around the
window, warped linoleum on the
floor and ragged cracks in the
ceiling above the tub.

"You're going to have trouble
with the people right above you."
Ann continued. “They insist on
taking at least ‘five showers a
week and the water always leaks
down through the ceiling. I‘ve
spent half my time here running

.up the steps tell them to lay off.

Oh. and by the way, make sure
you take showers early in the day.
The hot water has a habit of run-
ning out by 6 o'clock."

The kitchen was pretty nice ex-
cept for the splits in the linoleum
and the two broken chairs around
the table. A thin paperback call-
ed Myths of the Greeks and Ro-

. mans by Edith Hamilton propped

up one of the table legs.

“You can have that book,” Ann
offered. “I used it for a Classics
course last term and it’s a per-
fect fit for the table leg.”

The living room. however. had
a few minor problems.

“Be careful that your friends
don‘t sit on that chair.“ she cau-
tioned. pointing to one of the two
identical arm chairs in the room.

 

“There‘s a broken spring in it:
one of my male friends sat on it
before I could stop him and had a
really bad experience. You can
use it to throw books and coats
and things on. though. ’

“Oh, yeah,” her tour continued.
“Try to make sure that if you sit
on the couch either one person sits
in the middle or two people sit

down at the same time, one at I

each end. The leg broke so we use
bricks to prop up the couch. But
the couch has a tendency to tip
over if you’re not careful.

"Oh. Christ. I forgot the most
important thing. "Amy and I perk-

ed up our ears. "Make absolutely
sure that you don't put any furni-
tune in the middle of the room.“
She took us over to an electrical
socket in the wall next to the
closet and lifted up the corner of
the rug. “Theres only one socket
in the room so the landlord ran an
extension under the carpet to the
other side of the room. So you
have to watch out for sparks when
you vacuum.“

Ann led us into the bedroom
that was separated from the liv-
ing room by a translucent bam-
boo curtain. "Don‘t get dressed
with the light on if there‘s an_v-

body in the living room.” she
threw in casually»,

The bedroom contained two
beds, two small dressers, two

book cases made of slats of wood
and metal bars and no closet. A
small, annex-like sleeping room
opened off the larger bedroom and
held a bed, a small dresser and a
closet.

“You'll have to divide up your
clothes and put some of them in
the living room closet." she re-
marked apologetically. "It‘s a
hassle when people are there to
have to run out and get your cloth-

y es. But you‘ll just have to plan

ahead and try to get over your
modesty. Oh. and one last thing.
the windows leak. I‘ve found that
stuffing towels around it is the
best method to keep out the rain
and cold. The people who lived
here before used several layers
of maskin tape. but they were too

hard to get off when the weather ~

turned warm. Towels are much
more convenient.

"Well." Ann concluded as we
were leaving. “It‘s not a prize.
but you could do worse. And the
rent is one of the cheapest around.

Only $140 a month. utilities in-'

cluded.

Proprietors’ Liability Ambiguous

Security in off-campus housing
can pose a serious problem if not
dealt with adequately. There is
not the safety and obvious pro-
_tection of the dormitories while
off the campus.

Various realtors with extensive
holdings in Oakland have at-
tempted to remedy the security
situation in their properties
through several measures.

Information in this survey was
received from representatives of
the realtors discussed.

The Hanna Realty Company em-
ploys a system of locks, buzzers

‘ and. intercomsin all its proper-

ties and. in almost every building

Gold and Company Real Estate
has locks and intercdms.

Kane, Glickman and Daniels
Realty Companies only use door
locks. while Huss Realty aside
from normal measures. keeps one
full year escrow. This means that
money is put aside in a fund that
is not allowed to be touched ex-
cept for security purposes.

In the Oakland area this year.
Hanna. Daniels. Huss and Kane
Realties have reported no crime
on» their properties. However.
Howard Hanna.feels that some
"pot smoking _goes on. there had

. been no busts.“  . “

 

Both the Gold and Glickman
Companies reported a small num-
ber of forced entries this year.

When a crime is committed on
the premises. the responsibility

for notifying the police varies

with each landlord. Tenants
should be advised, however. to
alert proper authorities in the
case of an emergency.

Liability for tenants‘ personal
property. physical damage to the
building. or injury to the tenant
differs with each landlord. -Again.
it would be advisable to explore‘
the extent of the proprietors li-

yability before signing a lease.

A Ten Minute waikin§°'°5i§"Elll"
Of a few llakland Firetrapsff.

by MIKE SIMON

Apparently unmindful of complaints or pressure. many Oakland
landlords still allow their properties to deteriorate into harmful and’;
potentially hazardous firetraps. ‘  

A far cry from luxury housing. these five apartment buildings dis-
play the extent of disrepair that was allowed by the proprietors.  _' if

The building at the corner of McKee P1. and Louisa St.. owned‘ by‘.
Gold and Co.. has a wooden fusebox which is outlawed by the present
fire laws. illegal exposed clumps of wiring and a water heater re-35
portedly termed an “antique“ by an inspector from the Department"
of Public Health. One resident claimed that a fuse blows out no less 
than once a month. due to a dan-  '  .  7‘
gerous overload on the system.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
       
  
   
  
     
    
    
 
  
    

The Thompson property on Daw-
St. has several steps missing on
one of its fire escapes. This would
only inconvenience its user a ,
slight fall of several stories. 

One of the buildings water heat-
ers allegedly blew up several l
weeks ago. according to a tenant.
The heater now leaks hot water
on to the floor of the basement.

In addition to these faults. the
basement is cluttered with stacks
of mattresses and debris. which
creates a double fire hazard.

Brenden Behan was a rowdy

ganization which fought for the

return of Northern Ireland to the-

lrish Free State) that The Hos-
tage draws its life.
The Hostage is a British sol-
dier who is captured and held
by the Irish Republican Army
in retaliation for the proposed
hanging of a IRA member by
the British. It is in a rundown
house. rampant with characters
of all sorts. that Behan plays
out his sometimes wild. some-
times boisterous. sometimes
touching satire of life probling
investigations into morals. resent-
ment. and revolutionary spirits
that sparks the Playhouse stage
with a type of theatre that may
be dwelled upon for its genious
alone. -

Behan, who died in 1964, was
a supurb playwright. If one looks
closely, his impressive figure can
be seen stomping around the
stage as violently, as colorful,
as passionately as the characters
that he has brought to life. He
has captured the flavor of the
Irish struggle. His characters
are a wealth of expression—spon-
taneous personalities that are a
little more than real.

The characters in Behans
“Hostage” are expressions of
the man himself. hey are se-
parable. and it is when they
are each in movement that the
state becomes a college of indi-
vidual and symbiotic develop-
ment that captures the emotion.
encouraging the audience to get
caught up with the flavor and
substanence of the play.

When involved, you are
aware of it’s vivid and exhaust-

 

 
   

ing depth that is the type of
drama that makes The Hosgage
a richly rewarding and some-
what different theatrical experi-
ence. It is well balanced
with song, movement, and dia-
logue coming to life under Ken
Costigan’s skillful direction.
Costigan does a rather fine job

 
     
   
    
    
   
   
    
    
   
 

in bringing out most of the
rhythm and tempo in this
drama.

 
     
 

The cast is a well balanced
one. At the healm is Geoff Gar-
land who recreates his award
winning role of Leslie. the
British soldier. which won him
off-Broadway‘s coveted “Obie"
award in 1962. Mr. Garland
presents a truly beautiful per-
formance.

Ann Muffly (Meg). Alan Clar-
ey (Pat and Colette DiGiosio
iTerresa) are outstanding in
major roles. Lenora Nemetz
(Miss Gilchrist) and William
Becze (Mr. Mulleady) deliver
skillful and colorful performances.

In fine support are Scott Davis,
Coco Holette, Lee Ann Moffett,
Barbara Ellenberger, Dan Madia,
Lincoln Maazel, Barney Mc-
Kenna, and Ed West. Set Design

well done.

There‘s little more ‘that I can

Book: ls Peace Inevitable?
Author: Santiago Genoves
(Editor's Note: Santiago Geno-
vese, author and anthropologist,
will speak on his book and voyage
with Thor Heyerdahl and the Ra I I
at 8 p.m. next Monday evening at

Our cuurent sensibility is such
that international peace seems
more of a lunatics dream than all
the massacres of the 20th cen-
tury. Since God and the devil are
no longer with us. it has become
fashionalbe to attribute genocide
and its various cousins to man's
innate aggressive instincts. A
gratuitous biological curse. for
which responsibility is beside the
point.

Dr. Santiago Genoves argues in
Is Peace Inevitable? that the in-
nate aggression hypothesis is non-
sense and the war is a purely cul-
tural phenomenon.

Genoves. a physical anthropo-
logist. refutes the contentions of
Conrad Lorenzo and others who
have popularized the aggression
instinct hypothesis in recent

years. Genoves states his ideas
clearly and competently. although
his research is'not always docu-

mented and his reasoning. is oc-
casionally specious.

An example of the latter: the
mating season and concomitantly
territoriality are the two primary
causes of aggression in animals.
Man does not have a mating sea-
son, and thus a diffused territori-
aldrive?

In any case. the main problem
with Is Peace Inevitable‘? is that
Genoves never does get around to
considering war as a cultural
phenomenon. Aftergneglecting to
suggest the cultural function of
war. or possible substitutes for
it. he simply offers Margaret
Mead‘s suggestion that we "put
aside the tradition of obedience to
outworn norms." ‘

Still. the books contains some
surprising facts. Wolves are real-
ly friendly animals. Geese have
solved the eternal triangle hang-
up by adopting a mutually accept-
able form of troilism. And yes.
Virginia. there are a fex existing
cultures in which the concept of
war is non—existent.

Is Peace Inevitable? is easy
reading and Dr. Genoves is an in-
corrigible optimist. Read the book
after the 7 p.m. news. any of you
who want to believe things will be

they were actually bringing about
a momentous revolution. Yet
somehow Prussian authoritarian-
ism" survived the onslaught of
their various .“critical philso-
phies.”

A hundred years later. Jean-
Paul Sartre_insisted: “You are
your life and nothing else.“ While
not the first man to say this. he
said it was particular force, and it
was tested in the fire of resis-
tance tmthe Nazi occupation of
France. ‘

If you believe in the need for
freedom and social justice. you
must live your life according ‘to
these beliefs or they mean noth-
ing; words divorced from action
are nothing more than words. It’s
what you do that counts.

Students who are aware of vari-
ous irrationalities and profound
injustices can object that they
don't have the power to change the
world. Even after several years
of much-publicized social protest,
injustice persists.

“By instituting such a plan."
Hiller said. "an immediate 10
dollars will be eliminated from
the price of the insurance.“

Hiller also said that the Stu-
dent Health Service and the De-
partment of Student Affairs is
reviewing compulsory health in-
surance for dormitory students.

"Theyre approaching this from
the point of view that the uni-
versity is no longer in loco par-
ents." he explained.

HSO is also laying the ground-
work for investigating a Blue
Cross. Blue Shield health plan
now covering University of Penn-
sylvania students.

“The HSO feels that us stu-
dents have to pay for something
that insures their health. that it
should in fact cover all health
needs." Hiller stated.

“A firm committment has al-
ready been made by all parties
involved-administration. Student
Health Directors and the HSO-
that Health Service facilities
are not able to serve students."
He said.

"The Student Affairs Budget
that Kobosky submits to Edison
Montgomery on April 5 will in-
clude a packet for an enlarged.
rennovated Health Service. The
physical size of the facilities may
possibly extend further into Brack-
enridge Hall." Hiller said.

The HSO is also discussing the
possibility of setting up a stu-
dent medical emergency loan
fund. They are investigating ef-
ficient means of setting up a fund
that will permit students who
need a loan to obtain medical
service.

“The HSO." Hiller said. is
most concerned that the admin-
istration of such funds be done
by students. “

At the March 9 meeting. Wade
Lawson, Committees Commis-
sioner, expressed the idea that
as long as the Student Associa-
tion monies are being used that
it should be left up to students
How and Where money will be
used.

Hiller said “We agreed that all
parties will see the proposal
about a Student Health Medical
Emergency Fund. but it will not
serve as needing a rubber stamp
approval of the administration."

Ill Will

by KATHY MCCANN

The Off-Campus Housing Com-
mittee initiated a new trend in
community relations by invit-
ing the Oakland realtors to a
dialogue session this past Tues-
day.

Student tenants were repre-
sented by members of the Off-
Campus Housing Office and
—-Committee. Foreign Students
Association. and the Student As-
sociation.

The participating landlords.
representing the Glickman. Gold
and Kamin Realties. perceived
the major problem in their busi-
ness with students to be sub-
letting. Too many students with
full year leases. the landlords
alleged. leave their proprietors
in the lurch for summer rent.

Lamenting also the misuse
of facilities. the neighborhood
realtors felt that their tenants
should complain directly to them
more often.

In response. the student repre-
sentation aired a list of griev-
ances which they considered the
source of much ill will on the
part of the tenant. The prime
sore spot was inordinate security
deposits that frequently are re-
turned in unsubstantiated de-
pletion.

The University group believed
that students in general. but es-
pecially non—whites. are subject-
ed to discrimination when search-
ing for a place to live. In addi-

tion. there were complaints of
non-negotiable leases and poor
upkeep of the premises.

Resulting from the discussion
is the creation of a landlord-
tenant committee which will
meet bi-monthly to decide on
standards for housing conditions
and prices. A primary concern
in this matter is the factors con-
tributing to the determination
ofrent.

In effort to respond to their
tenants. the realtors. also agreed
to consider the possibility of re-
serving apartments for late-com-
ing foreign students if the Uni-
versity would guarantee them
tenants.

The final outcome of the meet-
ing was the decision to hold fre-
quent rap sessions in the Stu-
dent Union. starting in the fall.
between landlords and tenants.

Those present termed the dia-
logue as "rewarding and very
effective."

1 Center To Mme

The University of Pittsburgh
plans to move its computer cen-
ter from its Oakland campus to
the RIDC Industrial Park in
O’Hara Township this summer.

The move was announced joint-
ly by Pitt Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar and Hiram Milton presi-
dent of the Regional Industrial
Development Corporation (RIDC ).

According to Dr. Posvar, the
move represents a major trend
in the future development of
computers. since it will mean
that all of Pitt's computer users
will have access to the main
equipment through remoter ter-
minals located near faculty of-
fices and labs.

The center will be located in
a new 20.000 square foot build-
ing to be erected on a four-acre

The structure will house a new _

“The move was made neces-
sary." Chancellor Posvar said.
"because of limited facilities
for development on our campus.
This was one facility which

could be located feasibly atja"

park. we may be able to serve

When Coach Dick Bradshaw‘s
swimmers went to the University
of Pennsylvania for the Eastern
over the week-end. they didn't
anticipate scoring but they did
plan on putting on a good show-
ing.

That they did. he Panther
mermen broke five school
records bringing the total to
seven this season.

“That's the most we’ve broken
in one season for a long time."
boasted Bradshaw. “Last year
we only broke one record. and
at the Easterns this year we
broke at least one a day. We're
on the way up."

Junion Rick Rowe sparkled
for Pitt, crushing the school
record in the freestyle with a

,time of 5.04:3. It was the second

time he has broken the mark.
Rowe broke two other records.
Times of 1:50.-1 in the 200 and
in the 1000 set the standards.
Actually Rowe didn’t swim a

School

1000-even but aimed at
100-mark in the 1650 event.

“its legal for us to do this."
explained Bradshaw. “And Rick
was way below his old time at
the 1000 mark. His performance
was outstanding. “

Rowe had explained before
the Easterns that he had felt
“really up“ for the champion-
ships and was going “for per-
sonal achievement" to see how
far he could go.

Junior Fred Lewis broke two
records with a 4:4l.3 time in
the 100-IM and an 18:18.3 clock-

ing in the 1650 freestyle.

“He did better than ever be-
fore. I'm very pleased with his
excellent ' performance." prais-
ed Bradshaw.

Although butterflyer
Anderson and freestyler Tom
Hayes didn't follow suit in
breaking records, they did swim
some of their lowest times of
the season. Anderson had a 2:06
in the 200 butterfly and Hayes

equalled his 22.0 low in 50 free.
According to Bradshaw. Hayes
“hasnt swum betterinhislifc."

he only diver to attend the
championship was senior Ron
Ludwig, former gymnast. In the
three-meter event, Ludwig, who
was attending the Easterns for
the first time, didn’t score-
but as Bradshaw put it, he “per-
formed very well.”

Pitt didn‘t place at all in the
final competition (the top 12
men score in each event) and
Bradshaw cites the absence of
diver Dave Wessel as the rea-
son. Wessel, who couldn’t make
the trip to dent school, will be
travelling to the Nationals where
he placed in the top six in one-
meter diving last season.

Last year Pitt placed 18th
out of 36 schools in the East.
However, not ranking this win-
ter doesn‘t seem to matter to
Bradshaw.

“he important thing is that
we went,” he stated. “Our times
were better than last year, and
next year we hope they'll be
even better. We did things well,
and the kids and I feel good.”

Bradshaw continued by ex-

plaining, “We can’t build a
team overnight, but we’re on a
steady climb upward. We’re

upgrading the quality of the

Set For Next
Two Weeks

As the winter term nears an
end the Intramural Department
is filled with all kinds of action.

The All-Campus wrestling
tournament has been moved back
one week. and it is now sched-
uled for March 22nd. IM Direc-
tor Leo Bemis reminds that, with
the new date. more applicants
are welcomed.

The major reason for the
switch has been a lack of in-

ing to Bemis. He mentions that
frat track events (coming soon)
are a possible reason for the
slow grap sing-up.

It was something like 340 deadlines ago when my first Pitt
News article blew out of a window of the newspapers fourth floor

- offices here in the Student Union. When the just-completed story

- was swept out into a rain storm I quivered at what was ahead of
me as I nervously approached Sports Editor Jay Rosenstein to tell
him my article and my notes were gone.

(That's the first of hundreds of deadline anecdotes I could relay

farewell is needed. I need one,
Imean.

Joel Hurwitz, ‘a tennis player
and the Editor of the Polaris"
which is officed across the hall
from the Pitt News, has had

many conversations with me on I

Pitt athletics. When I told him
a few weeks ago that I wouldn‘t
write a farewell, he objected.
“You can’t just leave . . . with-
out saying something," Joel re-
torted.

Three-hundred-forty deadlines.
Joel was right. I can’t just leave
without saying something. The
different people I’ve contacted
in the Athletic Department, on
the staff, in the University com-
munity just don’t disappear when
March 15th comes around.

About all I can think of say-
ing is that I am basically satis-
fied with the people I have met
and worked with. I‘m even sat-
isfied with myself. Certainly I
placed the Pitt News above
classes all of the time and. as
cliche-ish as it may sound, my
education has been ten times
better than that of the com-
muter who just goes to classes.

I know where the sports pages
have gone wrong this past year..

and I‘m not too discouraged.
Things went the way I preferr-
ed more often than not.

I’m satisfied with everything-
almost.

Just one thing has bothered
me, now that I look back. When
the Black Action Society (BAS)
charged the Athletic Department
with racism they also pointed
the finger at the sports pages of
the Pitt News. They said the
coverage was racist. Those char-
ges against the Pitt News, against
me, have disgusted me.

It’s funny, I had been called
a “Nigger Lover" by Whites in
the past for respecting the Black
man. but the name calling nev-
er penetrated. If being a “Nig-
ger Lover" meant liking people.
there was nothing wrong with
it.

Suddenly, however, being plac-
ed on the other side, it hurt. Be-
ing called a racist meant some-
one thought I hated him on
sight. ‘

I‘m not going to be ignorant
of racial difficulty by saying
I don't recognize that a Black
man is different from a White
one. Coming from a neighbor-
hood that is probably 70 per
cent Black and 30 per cent White

I know there is a difference. But '

I do no more than "recognize“
that difference.
Before the BAS complaints.

pictures were selected for the

ething

Pitt News sports sections as ath-

letes achieved goals, as photo-
graphers gave the photos to us.
as the appropriate snagshot was
in thefiles. Not once in three-
years-or- so did I even think
about leaving someone off a
page because of skin color.

But once the BAS voiced the
charges, I started asking myself
ridiculous questions like “When
did we last run a Black?” and
“Christ, shouldl run that pic-
ture of Bryant Salter? He’s
missing the jump, and he might
get offended.”

I can honestly say that these
questions stopped right there-as
questions. Nothing changed on
the sports pages after the charg-
es. Blacks were publicized when
the stories were there. Whites
were publicized when the stor-
ies were there. We used the best
pictures we had for the purpose
that would arise.

Still, I don’t think the attitude
of many Blacks, perhaps most
Blacks, has changed either. To
the minds of far too many I am’
a racist — the Pitt News sports-
writers are racists.

I’m not talking about this
now because possible retaliation
is lessened as I leave the paper.
It’s just that the farewell pro-
vides me with an opportunity
to get the feelings off my chest.
My disgust with the Black at-
tude towards myself happens
to be the one blemish of my
Pitt News career. It’s a lot like
the little kid“ who can’t sleep af-
ter watching a horror‘ movie. He
has to cry out, hoping the night-
mares will go away.

I‘d prefer that the only night-
mare to remember from my
days on the Pitt News be the one
where my story blew out the
window.

Booters On

Astro-Turf
F or Drills

Taking advantage of the warm
spring-like weather Saturday, the
Pitt soccer team opened spring
drills with an intra-squad match
at the Stadium. The practice ses-
sion on the Astro Turf is the ini-
tial step in a long journey which
Coach Leo Bemis hopes will cul-
minate in a championship—and
possibly a playoff berth—next fall.

The championsip in question is
that of the Western Pennsylvania
Soccer Conference which Pitt has
just joined and the playoff berth
would be in the NCAA which the
team missed by one game last fall
when they loss. 2-1, to Penn State.

The team is fortunate in that
graduation claimed only four
starters (Dave DiEidi0. Kerry
Krause, Jerry Kruth and Confer-
ence Tsima Lekoma) from last
years 8-4 squad. Choosing re-

placements for them, however,

will be no easy task as Bemis has
several highly qualified kickers
from which to pick. The goalies
position, alone, vacated by
Krause. has half a dozen candi-
dates with a couple of freshmen
recruits likely to add to the group
in the fall. This is certainly a con-
trast to the situation that existed
three years ago when there was
bu-t one goalie on the team.

Among the outstanding JV boot-
ers who may be moving up to the
varsity this year are Tony Bolera,
Jorge Gutierrez, Jan Korman,
Jorge Maurer and Larry Skalski.
Gutierrez led the JV in scoring
with 13 goals in seven games.

Missing the drills, which will be
held every Saturday morning till
the end of the term, due to leg in-
juries are sophomores George
Hull and Gary lvlidock andfresh-
man forward Denny Kohlmyer.

The 1971 season begins on
Sept. 11 with a pre-season exhibi-
tion tilt against Davis-Elkins Col-
lege (W. Va.), who tied the Pitt
booters, 2-2, last season.

The reguar season opens with
Bucknell coming to Pittsburgh for
a game on Sept. 18.

Writers 
All-Star Slate

The Pittsburgh basketball writ-
ters honored Panther eager Paul
O’Gorek last week by naming him
to the local all-star team for ma-
jor college players.

Three Duquesne starters, Gar-
ry Nelson, Jarret Durham and
Mickey Davis along with West
Virginia’s Wil Robinson, round
out the quintet.

O’Gorek averaged 12.3 points
a game this season and led the
squad in rebounds with 245.

Recently, Buzzy Harrison was

selected by the writers of Basket- ‘

ball Weekly, a national newspa-
per, for honorable mention in this
region for sophomores.

Reggins, Flash
In IM Title Game

The 1970-71 intramural bas-
ketball title will be decided to-
night at 8 pm. when the Reggins

two weeks ago for the Indepen-
dent League crown. with the
Black Flash coming out on top,

bounds. Bryant Salter and John
Simpson are the Reggins’ main-

stays on offense and defense.

He finished 18th in a field of
32 with a low score in the com-
pulsories because of his place-
ment.

Dick Pribis competed in two
events, free exercise and long
horse vaulting.

7T)ave Andrew commented that
Pribis looked “low in his tumb—'
ling.” He also said that Pribis,‘

- who was unavailable ‘for com-

ment, was “not happy with his
performance.” Pribis missed
his compulsories and missed his
Arabian dive in his optionals.

Pribis finished 21st in free
exercise and 24th in vaulting.

Teammate Andrew topped
Pribis in vaulting, finishing 18th
and finished lower in free ex.
at275h.

“I‘ was happy that my vault-
ing was as good as it was,” said
Andrew. “It is a good finish to
my college career.”

A dollar’s Worth of food

for your thought.

JR.

Hot Shoppes, I respond to your offer. And .

Okay. I’ve done my part, now do yours.

*12°

5? ‘J? A?) /< . 0*.
Forbes & Oakland

I The choice is yours.
I Hamburgers,

chicken, Coke or an Orange
I Freeze. Even a Do It Yourself

up to a buck.

We’re being tested.

We thought we

  had it knocked,

but we didn’t.

Sure, we knew things would be
tough when we moved in because
the other hamburger guys, the
hot dog place and Mexican food
people were already alive and
well at Pitt. .

But being a little brash we
thought you’d quickly recognize
that our food and menu variety
was as good or better than their

food and menu variety.
Only that didn’t happen.

Maybe you don’t like
our looks.

Okay. We’re doing something 1
about that. The bright orange
sign outside has to stay. Corporate
rules and regulations won’t let us
change it. Besides, it cost a
bundle. So bear with us.

But inside We’re making
changes.

It’s going to be less bright and
glaring. Softer. And We’re taking

\\

some of the plastic stuff off the
walls. And maybe our cafeteria
style service is one too many
cafeteria lines in your life, so out
it goes.

Leave word on our wall.  

We’re even putting a big board
in our place where you can leave
messages for people. Or post a
declaration. Or invitation. Or
offer something for sale. Or ask
for a ride to Allentown.‘ .

Use it for whatever you like.

Food for your thought.

To further entice you,
we make this offer.

Fill out our coupon with
any sort of semi-
reasonable suggestion on
what we can do better.

Bring it in and we’ll
trade it and your
suggestion for a dollar’s
worth of our food. Free.

 

You see, We need a valid

measuring stick for this ad,

because we’ve never done one like
it before. And a lot of our people
are dubious. ,

Does our honest. appeal and
willingnessto change touch your
sense of logic and decency?

Your coupon response will
tell us. ’

We can’t buy your love.

And we understand that. The .
coupon is a simple trade and  
inducement. We’re hoping once
you come in, see what We’re doing
and taste our good food, you’ll
like us. And we’ll have the chance
to be friends.

So, that’s it, Pitt. Plain and
simple. ,

All this time you probably

thought a fast-food chain was just

a big, enormous, non-feeling and
insensitive corporate structure,
right?

Wrong.

We need you. And that’s
the truth. , 1
