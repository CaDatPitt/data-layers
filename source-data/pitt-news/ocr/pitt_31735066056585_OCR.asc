Amanda Roberts does not want a job. Or at
least that’s the impr’ession you get after talk-
ing with the 25-year-old, 1992 college gradu-
ate, who lives at home and is unemployed.
It’s not that she hasn’t had offers, but entry-
level jobs are not good enough for this
Dean’s list grad. She said she wants a job

, with a title.

She’s not alone. Every year, thousands of
college graduates hit the already flooded job
market in search of a future. Some find entry-
level positions in their field of study, others
take whatever they can find. But some set
their sights too high and end upsitting at
home, diploma in one hand, want ads in the
other.

This was the case with Roberts. She gradu-
ated as a writing major from the University oi
Pittsburgh with a 3.8 grade point average.

No additional aces}. robe taken

By Sam Gresock
Staﬂ’ Writer

Next semester, Ross Pasquale
will be taking over as Student
Government Boards president
after all of the recent controver-
sy.

SGB’s Judicial Committee
voted Thursday afternoon to
uphold sanctions taken by the
Elections Committee against
SGB President-elect Pasquale.
No additional action will be

taken against Pasquale, who-

was found guilty Nov. 18.of
violating Elections Committee
code by actively campaigning
within 100 feet of election
booths.

“The Judicial Board upheld
the Elections Committee’s sanc-
tions,” SGB advisor Joyce
Giangarlo said.

“The results were discus-

sed and the sanctions will

stand.”

According to SGB Elections
Chair Deborah Ryan, the
Elections Committee disquali-
fied Pasquale’s votes from
the-Sutherland Hall voting
area, where Pasquale’s viola-
tions took place. Pasquale
was also required to submit a
formal public apology for his
actions. '

“From what I understand, the
Judicial Board thought our
sanctions were fine and will
stand,” Ryan said. “All candi-
dates who won are official
now.” I

Pasquale was unavailable for
comment Friday.

SGB President Jacob Brody
said the incoming board will
now be able to concentrate on
“getting back to business” once
the new semester begins.

“I’m glad the process is over
 I’m happy to see everything
has worked itself out,” Brody
said.

“It’s time for us to move on,
put away our differences and
work together toward our com-
mon goal of serving the univer-
sity.”

Pitt to particzpate in
cancer screen mgs

By Scott Carpel
For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center and Magee-Women’s Hospital
recently announced their participation in a study to deter-
mine whether the use of certain screening tests to detect
cancers actually saves lives. These tests detect cancers of the
prostate, lung, colorectum and ovary.

This program, which will involve 148,000 men and
women volunteers ages 60 to 74, is part of a national study
sponsored by the National. Cancer Institute. PCI is one of 10
medical centers in the country which received funds for this
program.

“The primary purpose of this study is to answer the ques-
tion of whetherscreening for these (PLCO) cancers, actually
reduces one’s chances of dying from these cancers,” said Dr.
Joel Weissfeld, assistant professor of epidemiology at the
University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health
andprincipal investigator for the study at PCI.

The tests, which will be evaluated in the screening trial,
will include: digital rectal examinations, prostate-specific
antigen blood tests for prostate cancer, chest x-rays for lung

Upward Boundbenefits high school students

Byjennifer Vernet
Staﬂ‘ Writer '

The old met the new last
Thursday at an Upward Bound
reception designed to bring stu-
dents together through the ﬁeld
of learning.

“The Upward Bound project
is like a family environment,”
said Renee Frazier Ph.D., direc-
tor of the Upward Bound pro-
ject. “And, the introduction of
the new students is a way for
everybody to get to know
everybody else.”

The Upward Bound, project, a
part of the University Challenge
for Excellence Program (UCEP),
is a program designed to
encourage students in grades
nine through 12 to graduate
from high school and pursue a
post-secondary education.

The program hosts 108 high
school students from all
Pittsburgh city school districts
and three Catholic high schools:

Central Catholic, Oakland
Catholic and Mount Alvernia.

“We bring together all differ-
ent schools and communities
together, so they’re not at
war with each other,” Frazier
said.

The program, which began in
1968, is federally funded
through the Department of
Education and the participants
must meet eligibility require-
ments. Students must be from a
low-income family or be the
first college-bound student from
their family. The student must
also exhibit some academic
need for acceptance into the
program.

Frazier said although the
main events of the program
occur during the summer, the
program features year-round
benefit projects such as after-
school tutoring and college
preparatory seminars.

“We have PSAT and SAT
preparatory programs, self-

esteem workshops, sexuality
development programs, finan-
cial aid workshops and comput-
er application programs,” she
said. “We also send four stu-
dents to a leadership develop-
ment conference in
Washington, D.C., where the
students get to interact with
people in Capitol Hill and with
other students.”

Frazier, director since 1988
and counselor since 1977, said
the project is successful because
90 to 95 percent of the students
graduate from high school and
pursue some post-high school
education.

“Nationally, this program is
the most successful, next to the
Headstart Program. And, Pitt
has the second largest program
in Pennsylvania — next to Penn
State.”

Occasionally, a student will
be dismissed from the program,
but Frazier said the students are
never left out entirely.

“There have been situations
when there is an incompatibili-
ty, when the goals of the pro-
gram are not matched with the
goals of the student, but even
with termination we will extend
continued support to that stu-
dent,” she said.

Frazier said the program
receives support from parents,
school counselors and school
administrators, but said every-
one must support area
teenagers.

“Now is not the time to give
up,” Frazier said. “It’s important
to look at the positive things
that kids do.

“The students are positive,
but don’t be so critical of the
ones who can be negative.
They should have our help. We
are the one they look up to, and
we should all stick out our
hands and help. It’s not easy to
do, but they are our future. .If
we ignore them, we ignore our
future.”

Santa Claus stopped by
the William Pitt Union
yesterday afternoon
to pass out toys and lis-
ten to requests from chil-
dren anxious to get
the present that’s on the
top of their Christmas
list.

The College of General

Studies Student
Government Council
held their annual

Children’s Holiday Party
yesterday in the Schenley
Cafe from 1 to 3 p.m.
The council sponsors the
party each year for CGS
students with children in
their families.

“My kids know he’s
not the real Santa, they
think he’s one of Santa’s
helpers,” CGS student
Kim Smithwick said.

Council member Bill
Farmer, dressed in a
Santa suit, asked the
boys and girls if they
were good this year and
took requests for teddy
bears, skateboards and
Batman games.

Council member
Deborah Vidmar played
Santa’s helper and
passed out hanging
Christmas decorations
filled with toys
and candy to the chil-
dren;

Smithwick has -been
bringing her children,
Brandon, 6, and Mia, 4,
to the Children’s Holiday
Party for the past several
years.

She said she is glad
that the Student Activities
fee she pays goes to
an event such as the
party.

“Even if I didn’t
have children, its still a
nice idea,” Smithwick
said.

The children and their
parents enjoyed cookies
and punch, made
sparkling Christmas
wreaths and colored pic-
tures while waiting for
Santa to arrive.

individual and not the job market.

Marti Moore, coordinator of the Career
Counseling Center at Pitt, said waiting for
that perfect job right after graduation is
unrealistic and only a small percentage of
graduates do this.

“Everyone "pays their dues,” Moore said.
“Many people have to go through several

»small jobs first until a good one comes
‘ along. We advise people to take any job

to make money and do volunteer work or

‘ internships.”

This view is common in today’s market-
place. The easiest way to find a job is to
have a job. “They want experience,” said
Jane Denovcheck, associate director at the
Pitt Placement Service. “Employers are
demanding more. They want people who
have had internships, volunteer work,
independent study or have a part—time job
related to the job they are applying for.”

But Roberts’ reply to all of this was a
simple question, “What good is experi-
ence going to do if there are no jobs avail-
able that require it?”

®

According to Dennis Ryan, director of
Career Services and Placement at Carnegie
Mellon University, the.answer' is simple.
There are jobs available, maybe not in the
number they were five years ago, but they
are available.

“The action is in the small and mid—sized
Companies,” Ryan said. “The entry-level
jobs are not available for the traditional,
large, corporate employers. These compa-
nies have scaled down. The small and
mid-sized firms are now attempting to
compete with larger firms for the entry-
level graduates.”

Ryan views Roberts’ problem as one of
expectations. “Many graduates’. ideal jobs
involve large corporations. The higher
they set their sights, the larger the corpo-
ration. Plus the smaller firms don’t offer
the large corporation salaries that some
graduates expect to find.”

Mark Johnson graduated from

~Duquesne University in 1991 with a bach-

elor’s degree in finance. Throughout col-
lege, he dreamed ofrlanding the perfect
job — corner offices, power lunches and

car phones. Now all he looks forward to is
the morning newspaper to search the
want ads and read the comics.

Johnson’s situation is not much different
than Roberts’. He’s unemployed, lives at
home and refuses to “settle” for any job
that he considers below him. He is, how-
ever, a little more flexible than Roberts. So
why doesn’t he have a job?

In Johnson’s own words, “I worked hard
during school, and I wanted to have some
fun when I graduated.” But this excuse
implies laziness and ranks right below
Roberts’ frustrations with the job market.

When Johnson graduated, he didn’t
even bother to seek the help of the Career
Placement Center at Duquesne. He simply
sent his resume to the largest firms in
Pittsburgh. In addition, at the bottom of
his resume were the words, “Not willing
to travel.”

“I love Pittsburgh,” Johnson said. “I
want to find a job here and make my
home here. I’ve lived here most of my life
and wouldn’t even know what to do if I

moved to another city.”

Ryan said he has seen this
before. “Most graduates in the
past have an idea where they
want to work,” he said. “You
must- completely discard this
idea before you begin your job
search. You have to look for
job opportunities, not where
the job is located.

Denovchek added, “We’re
seeing this problem more than
ever. The recent trend has
been that people want to stay
in Pittsburgh. From 1988 to
1992, the percentage of gradu-
ates with a bachelor’s degree
from Pitt who found jobs in
Pennsylvania rose from 58 per-
cent to 72 percent. Denovchek
attributed this to the rise of
health and education-related
jobs in the state.

But, both placement services
said this is hardly anexcuse.
The key to finding a good job
after college is a thorough and
extensive search. This is some-
thing Johnson failed to do at
all, not because he thought he
didn’t have to, but because he
said he figured it was a waste
of time.

“A lot of my friends went to
the placement service,”
Johnson said, “and they came
up empty. They said it took
them forever just to find one
lead and most of the leads they
found never worked out. I
thought I’d do just as well on
my own.”

Johnson’s view

Denovchek says, it’s still the
best way for graduates to find
a job.

“The students have to be
more ﬂexible with their job
search,” She said. “The key is
to start early and work at it
with enthusiasm and a sense of
reality. A good job search is
like an inverted pyramid. You
cast your net out in a large
area, and then as you get
leads, you narrow up your
search.”

Ryan attributed the recent
difficulties of job searching to
the changing market. “We’re
getting smaller companies
recruiting on campus,” he said.
“They’re not following the tra-
ditional paths that the larger
corporations used to. A gradu-
ate has to search harder for a
job.” I

The majority of students
who graduate from college
end up with some sort of
job. But some students
graduating at every college
follow the examples of Roberts
and Johnson. The perfect job
is a dream everybody has,

THE pm NEWS, Monday, December 6, 1993
I  

but it’s hardly ever found
right after graduation.
Attaining that dream is a long
process, which is easily dis-
rupted by pride or discourage-
ment.

It’s been a long year since .

Roberts graduated. Since then,
her only noteworthy accom-
plishment has been a month-
long trip to Paris financed by
her parents.“I think theyjust
wanted; me out of the house,”
she said.

Her days are spent shopping .

or visiting friends. She’s
now contemplating getting a
part-time job to pay off the
credit card bills that have accu-
mulated since college. But
that’s not the most important
reason.

“I need something to do,”
she said. “The bills are noth-
ing. I’ll take care of them in a
couple of months after I find
my real job.”

Joh'nson’s days are not
much different. In the past
two years, he has held several
part—time jobs to finance his
social life. He is currently

searching for another. He’s
hooked on a soap opera and
keeps up with current best-
sellers. And every now and
then he sends out the occa-
sional resume.

“My parents are starting
to get on my case,” he says.
“They keep telling me
I’m going to pay them back
for- supporting me after
college. I just tell them I’ll
pay them ba-ck and then
some.”

In truth, the job market
could be better, but it is not
getting worse. A poll conduct-
ed by the Pitt Placement
Service on the Class of 1993
said the same percentage of
graduates found jobs as last
year.

As Moore said, “If people lis-
ten to the media, the job mar-
ket is pretty grim. People get
discouraged and give up. As
Bill Cosby said, 90 percent of
success is just showing up.
Graduates have to approach
their job search with enthusi-
asm and not stop until they are
employed.”

Richardson, he was instructed
by Nixon to hire a special pros-
ecutor if it became necessary
for a thorough investigation.
Richardson asked Cox, a
Harvard professor and former
solicitor general under
President Kennedy, to take the
job.

Cox said he initially reacted
with excitement to the job
which was “so important to the
country.” After some more
thought, however, he said he
realized the immense difficulty
of the position.

“But hey, I figured who bet-
ter to take a no—win job than a
tenured professor who has no
interest in public office any-

’way,” Cox said, sarcastically

reﬂecting on his decision.

The difficulty, according to
Cox, was in determining
whether the president was sub-
ject to judicial process, espe-
cially in light of executive privi-
lege.

“What can you do if the pres-
ident refuses? Nixon had quite
sweeping ideas about the

served to justify Cox’s legal
moves.

“lNixonl made [Watergate]
into a much more serious prob-
lem by attempting a cover-up,”
said Heymann, who comment-
ed on how Watergate became
one of the most televised
events in history.

After Cox received the sub-
poena for the Watergate tapes,
the Nixon administration tried
to reach acompromise with
Cox concerning their release.
Despite the White House’s offi-
cial statement that a compro-
mise had been reached, Cox
said he never approved such
an agreement.

“I looked over their proposal,
but I was under the impression
it would be changed,” Cox
said, referring to several parts
of the agreement he could not
accept. Included in the agree-
ment was the condition that
Cox could not request any
more tapes in return for the
White House release of the
edited transcripts of the tapes
for which Cox already had a
subpoena. '

“I saw the clause on" the
agreement about no future
access to tapes,” Richardson
said. “I had to get across [to
Nixon] that I could not support

Cox went public with his
allegations concerning the
White House at a press confer-
ence on Saturday, Oct. 20.
Richardson, who was ordered
to fire Cox that day, resigned
his position because
he believed Cox'was correct.
“I tried to convince the presi-
dent that [firing Cox] was the
wrong course,” Richardson
said.

Heymann said Richardson’s
resignation was of extreme
importance to the outcome of
Watergate.

“I thought if [Richardson]
didn’t back [Cox], the president
would definitely win,” he said.

To this day, Richardson said
he believes that the White
House had no genuine interest
in compromise, but rather on

Richardson, Nixon and Haig
knew Cox would reject the
proposal and expected him to
fire Cox. “They thought I’d roll
over,” Richardson said. 9

Robert Bork was the person
who eventually signed the
order to fire Cox that night.

“Nixon believed Cox was out
to get him,” Richardson said.
“His fatal flaw was his cyni-
cis1n.”

According to Doyle, the
White House tried to portray
Richardson and Cox as “bad
people” all along.

Jim Nagel, a member of the
audience from Meadville, Pa.
said he considered Richardson
“a man of immense integrity”
then and now.

“He is a unique individual,”
Nagel said. “Everyone should
have a boss that will stand

According to Foner, the

Child support must he paid

On Friday Butler County, took a positive step toward
dealing with a devastating problem in this country. Dr.
Gerald B. Applegate spent three hours in jail for failure
to pay child support. While three hours may seem like
a minute amount of time, he was only released after
some unidentified friends paid $10,000 toward the
$40,000 he owed in back support.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
Applegate, an obstetrician—gynecologist practicing out
of Passant Hospital, was found to be able to pay the
$4,000 a month support payments but “has willfully

refused to do so.” Judge Thomas J.- Doerr chastised

Applegate, telling him that child support had priority
over “all other obligations and debts. You have access
to funds that could have been used to support but
instead were used  to maintain your lifestyle” (Post-
Gazette). The judge had threatened to revoke
Applegate’s medical license, but decided not to do so.

. This is one positive example in a field of many
horror stories. According to a report in the May 4, 1992
issue of Newsweele, in 1990 state agencies reported they
were only collecting in 17.9 percent of the 12 million

cases they were pursuing. In 1989, only 25.5 percent of

single—parent households with children under 21
received the full amount of chﬂd support coming to
them. With the rising numbers of youthful offenders,
much discussion is given over to family values.
Although many call for a return to “family values” of
the past, providing for the children is what is really at
issue. Columnist Mike Royko of the Chicago Tribune
made this point in a recent column about crime in the
cities: “most of the families were stable. There was
divorce, but most of the men paid child support.”
While the government should not enforce morality,
they must enforce laws which protect children.

Other judges and child support officials should
use this case as an example. In 1984 Congress passed
legislation forcing local governments to help all custo-
dial parents collect child support payments. Since that
time, the government has been more active in collect-
ing from absent fathers (Newsweek). They have gar-
nished, paychecks and taken income tax refunds from
those delinquent in making their payments.

Not only should the government collect from
the deadbeat dads, but the deadbeat moms out there as
well. More counties. should follow the lead of the
Butler county case. This is an aspect of law enforce-
ment well worth the tax payers money.

While it would be nice if parents took an active
role in their children’s lives, it is not always the case.
The least that can be done is to force absent parents to
take a share of the responsibility to provide for the
children.

Fellowship shouldn't be Greek to us

Recently I ran across a col-
umn by Post-Gazette writer
Sally Kalson about the lack of
“public spaces.”

A few months ago my pastor
preached a sermon about soci-
ety moving from the front
porch to the back porch. These
days, there’s much documenta-
tion of crime, sexual activity,
drugs, drunkenness, violence
and greed.

I think they’re all related to a

one thing — the loss of what
can be best described as
leoinonia.

Koinonia is a Greek word,
often used in evangelical
Christian circles, that loosely
translates into “fellowship” or
“community.” I’ve been con-
vinced for a number of years
that most of our social prob-
lems stem from alienation,
loneliness and fear of others.
Put another way, our society
has lost much of the ability to
relate to others in a healthy
manner.

Currently Americans have
trouble connecting emotionally
and relationally to each other.
We look for those who have
what we want in order to gain
some satisfaction from “know-
ing the right people.” We end
up feeling betrayed or used. Or
we steal - money, goods, ideas
— thinking that if we have
enough of what we want then
we’ll feel better. It doesn’t satis-
fy. Some people, given over to
hopelessness, try to kill the
pain with such things as drink,
drugs or sex; that turns into a
dead end as well. We spend
our money and time on clothes
and entertainment, which often
become a waste. Truth is,
we’ve lost contact with our
own humanity.

The loss of leomonia proba-
bly dates back to the end of
World War II and the unusual

afﬂuence that characterized the
1950’s.":Those with the means
were able to move to suburbia
and enjoy the “American
Dream:” the house, two cars,
swimming pool, music and
dance lessons, college for the
children. Yet did these posses-
sions bring happiness? Not at
all! I remember a Cartoon 21
number of years ago where the
father asked his three children
why they were playing in the
middle of the floor in the living

Rick
Nowlin

room. He complained that he
was able to buy a house with
enough bedrooms that each
child could have his own. The
children responded, “We’re
lonely.”

From ‘what Itknow about
American culture before I was
born, society was more com-
munity—orient_ed. Fairs, debates,
even sporting events were rea-
sons for people to get together.
There wasn’t much money or
many possessions then, so
everyone had to share; when a
disaster or tragedy occurred, all
helped out. Now that we think
we’re more self-sufficient
(though we’re not), we can do
what we please without any
accountability to anyone for
our actions. The results, how-
ever, speak for themselves.

For example, the reasons our
educational system has gone to
pot are twofold. One, we’ve
divorced “education” from real
learning and simply made the
goal of education to get cre-
dentials to get a good job and
make lots of money. We place

undue pressures on our chil-
dren to succeed whatever the
cost, to “get ahead” no matter
what it takes.

Is it any wonder that so
many students cheat? Two,
when they don’t perform to
our satisfaction, we want to
blame someone — the school,
the teachers, perhaps the chil-
dren themselves for “not try-
ing” when the real problem is
that we try to live our lives
through our children. I went
through that myself; I started
my college career as an engi-
neering major at Georgia Tech,
even though I never really did
have the talent for that kind of
work.

I’ve rediscovered my own
need for good, solid relation-
ships over the past eleven
years. Sometimes I’ve needed a
shoulder to cry on or to be of
assistance to someone else
whose heart is troubled and
I’m thankful that I’ve_ had those
opportunities to love and be
loved, not just for the sake of
giving or receiving but just to
feel that “connection” - that I
matter in this world because
I’m in it.

Often I see others as little
children who need to feel
wanted, and this removes the
arrogance from my heart when
I think someone is beneath me.
This started about three years
ago, when a former girlfriend

gave me a teddy bear as a

Christmas present.

And that just may be the key
to reestablishing /eoinonia.
Perhaps we need to learn to
play together and enjoy each
other’s company for its own
sake and not hope to gain any-
thing by our associations.
Eventually, we might finally get
what we’re searching for.

Ricle Nowlin is a media coma-
nications major.

 

 

Cauley, Peterson

Big East opener

By Jason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

Saturday morning, 9:50 a.m.

While most of Oaklandslept,
Will Cauley shot 

And shot 

And shot 

The vaunted Junior College
recruit had done little to nothing
in four previous games in a Pitt
uniform to warrant his huge
preseason hype.

But, much like the Panthers in
their 94-82 win over the
Providence Friars on Saturday,
Cauley wouldn’t let a little fail-
ure mess up his picture, as he

took to the Fitzgerald Field,

House floor two-and-a‘-half
hours early to improve on his
heretofore disappointing game.

“The only way to beat [failure]
is to just keep working,” Cauley,
who scored 14 points and
grabbed a team-high seven
boards, said. “Working and
shooting a lot.”

It was that attitude — inverted
a bit — that helped the Panther
defense dominate a formidable
Friar front line and provide Pitt
with enough of a second—half
surge to capture*their first Big
East victory of the season.

After matching up with man-
to-man defense for nearly the
first 10 minutes of the first half,
the Panthers opened the second
period in a 2-3 zone — ‘a
defense designed to exploit the
Friars’ outside shooting prob-
lems.

But, for the first five minutes,
the only one doing the exploit-
ing was Providence forward
Franklin Western, who opened

the half with 12 rapid points
including a pair of net-burning
three—pointers that stretched the
Friar lead to seven at 62-55.
Western and the Friars, how-
ever, eventually felt the effects
of the continuous Pitt zone as
their once-torrid outside shoot-

in our pool.”

Junior Gary Mule started off the dom-

ing dried up like a south Texas
well and virtually stifled the
offense . . and any chance of
victory.

“The 2-3 zone seemed to cut
them down,” Pitt head coach
Paul.Evans said. “We thought
that [Providence’s] weakness

was their [lack of consistent]
outside shooting. I impressed
on the kids that we had to know
where [Western] was.”

“Paul does as good a job as
anyone in the league,”
Providence head coach Rick

Christmas Meet.

The men’s swimming and diving
team was the host with the most.

Swimming without Aaron Fortner for
the weekend, Matt Brady for two days
and head coach Chuck Knoles — who
all were at the United States Swimming
Open — Pitt breezed past the competi-
tion in the eighth annual Pitt
Invitational at Trees Pool this weekend.

Pitt, with 977 points, not only won,
but destroyed the second-place finisher
Miami of Ohio, who finished with 757.5
points.

James Madison finished with 644
points, Kenyon with 387, Buffalo with
325.5 and Oberlin with 25.

“We have so much depth as a team.
We have so many talented swimmers,
that we knew that we would come out
on top,” newly in—charge assistant
coach David Amato said. “Our guys
really got up for this. This is our pool.

ination on the -right foot when he took
first in the 1,650 freestyle and Sam
Dommel finished third.

Pitt proceeded _to win the 800-relay
freestyle and the 200-relay freestyle.

Pitt’s David Williams was involved in
two of the most exciting races of the
meet when he came from behind to
steal first from fellow teammate Sami
Vartiainen by .44 of a second in the 200
freestyle. ‘

Jonti Bacharach finished fourth in the
event. Then Williams used his heroics
to win the 500 freestyle, edging James

Madison’s Brian Manning by a half ‘

stroke. _

Pitt also overpowered opponents in
the 100 freestyle. David Williams, Zach
Economos, and Sami Vartiainen fin-
ished one, two, three respectively.

“We knew we would come out on

When the Pitt Invitational
originated, it favored teams like
Pitt. The large meet allowing
unlimited swimmers into each
event catered to the big rosters
of the Pitt‘women’s swimming
team.

But the eighth annual Pitt
Invite at Trees Pool this week-

. end wasn’t as accommodating

to the Panthers as it used to be.
The outnumbered Pitt women’s
team finished third with 555
points behind first-place Miami
(Ohio), 1228 points, and sec-
ond—p1ace James Madison, 675
points. ‘

Miami won its second consec-
utive Pitt Invite with a roster
almost double that of the Pitt
team —— 31 swimmers to Pitt’s
16. »
“I think we knew we weren’t
going to win,” senior captain

Jennifer Burns said. “Being a
-smaller team, we just. didn’t
have the numbers to put in the
“water.’_’

Since the format of the Invite"

made it almost impossible for
the women to win, they focused
on swimming personal best
times.

“We went into it just expect-
ing to do really well individual-
ly,” Burns said.

“Overall our team had about

After hanging for the first 20
minutes with one of the pre-
season Top Five teams in
women’s basketball, the Pitt
Panthers finally succumbed to
the Vanderbilt Lady
Commodores, 82-64 at the First
American-MCI Classic
Tournament in Nashville.

The Panthers went into the
locker room tied at 38 with
Vandy then watched as the
Commodores out-scored them
44-26 to take the Friday night
game.

Despite getting beat by 18,
the Panthers (2-1) can still be
satisfied with a moral victory in
the loss.

“If we go down there and lose

biggest upset of all time.”

Forward Jonna Huemrich led
the Panthers with 18 points and
joined guard Jenine Joyce, who
scored 12, as the only two
Panthers in double ﬁgures.

Conversely, the Commodores
(2-2) put four players in double
figures, as Donna Harris and
Ginger Jared each threw down
16 points to pace Vandy.

After shooting nearly 52 per-
cent in the first half, the
Panthers cooled off consider-
ably, hitting on only 30 percent
of their shots in the second stan-
za. The Commodores improved
after the intermission, shooting
60 percent in the second 20
after hitting on 15 of 30 shots
(50 percent) in the first period.
They finished at 55 percent.

Last Saturday the Pitt men’s
and women’s track and field
teams ventured to West
Virginia for the Holiday
Invitational.

The result? The Panthers left
Morgantown with several run-
ners qualifying for the IC4As
to go along with a record—set-
ting performance.

In the women’s events,
Najuma Fletcher and Kim
Blair led the way for the
Panthers, qualifying for the

I NCAAS in the first meet of the

season.

Fletcher qualified with her
first-place performances in
both the long jump (20 feet)
and triple jump (41’ 2 1/2 “).

meter hurdles.

“I’m still surprised about my
time,” Blair said. “I never ran
that fast before  I think for
me to get in the nationals, I’ll
have to run 7.8 or faster.”

Pitt also took second (Stacy
Suggs), third (Fletcher), fourth
(Jennifer Williams), and sixth
(Tanya Mullins). The top four
finishers all ran fast enough to
qualify for IC4As.

In the men’s competition,
Jim Monk, Jay Jones and
Jerrell Williams led the way.
Monk outmuscled the shot

of 53’ 1/2” for the victory. His
throw qualified him for the
IC4As. With only a week of

“I’m happy with the time for‘

would run about a 6.5.

The highlight of the three
events was the 500 meters.
Williams attacked the race,
leaving everyone at the start-
ing line on his way to an easy
victory.

“I didn’t feel it was easy,”
Williams said. “I was nervous
because it was my first meet
and it carried me through.

llgeterson, Cauley, Aggelou lead

Byjack Becker
Staff‘ Writer

After Pitt forward Jaime
Peterson scored the bucket that
knotted Saturday’s game
between Pitt and Providence at
62,. he instantly looked toward
head coach Paul Evans for
approval.

The basket brought the Pitt
bench to its feet and Evans

‘approximately six to eight inch-

es off the floor. The coach’s ear-
to-ear smile was topped only by
his emphatic pointing at
Peterson.

Peterson, a junior college
transfer, returned the gesture as
he received a bear hug from fel-
low newcomer Willie Cauley.

The new boys had arrived.

Peterson, Cauley and rookie

I Sotiris Aggelou combined to

play a huge role for Pitt in their

first Big East game, a 94-82 win
over the Friars.

“I thought the bench did a
great job,” Evans said. “Good
defense  good scoring.”

The three Pitt newcomers
came off the bench to score 39
points, out-scoring the starting
unit (minus Jerry McCullough’s
19 points) by three. -

“I thought their bench came
in and did some good things for
them," Friars‘ coach Rick Barnes
said. Barnes may have under-
stated things a bit because the
Pitt newcomers turned the tide
in the Panthers’ favor, making
big plays during crunchtime.

With Pitt trailing 62-56 in the
second half, Cauley took an
outlet pass coast-to—coast and
hit a pull-up jumper in the lane.

After Barnes was called for a
technical foul and McCullough
sank the foul shots, Peterson’s

free throw at the 11:07 mark to
give Pitt the lead for good.

“It was nice to see Willie get a

“I feel the same every game,
but today I guess my shot was
on,” Cauley said. “Me and Jaime
work out a lot after practice. We
knew we had to come to play

After a couple of layups by
Gant and a jumper by Sirnpkins,
Peterson gathered a rebound off
an Aggelou shot and laid it in to
give Pitt a 71-66 lead.

Pitt
Continued from page 9
Barnes said of Evans and his
defensive strategy. “Pitt’s always
been underrated, and Paul‘ did a

good job.”

Despite scoring 28 points and
shooting 50 percent (12-24)
from the ﬁeld, including two-of-
three three-pointers, Western
was held to only one basket in
the ﬁnal 15:21 of the game.

“I thought they had a good
job shadowing Western,”
Barnes said.

“We know [Western] from
New York — he's a good foul
line jump shooter,” Pitt point
guard Jeny McCullough said.

Despite their late domination
defensively, the Panthers strug-
gled in the defensive end early,
giving upinside baskets to
Michael Smith and Dickey
Simpkins and consistently
breaking down not only around
the hoop — where they were
generous in giving up second-
chance points — but also for
medium-range jumpers.

But while it took a while for
the Pitt defense to mesh, it was
not until point guard
McCullough took over that their
offense got on track.

McCullough began to run the
offense at 13:38 of the first
when he dished to Eric Mobley

for the first of the center’s
dunks. The guard followed with
a pull-up three and a a pair of
jumpers to cut the Providence
lead to four at 16-20. C

After Jaime Peterson hit the
second of two free throws,
McCullough came back with his
second and final three-pointer
of the afternoon. By the time
the half was finished the
Panthers cut what had been as
much as a nine-point Friar lead
to just two, 47-45.

The Friars rode Western’s ,

‘heroics in the opening minutes
of the second period to a seven
point lead as the junior ran off
Providence’s first 10 points in
the half on a pair of jumpers
and a pair of threes. Not coinci-
dentally, their largest lead of the
half (seven points) dissipated
rapidly as Western’s production
began to wane.

Barnes received a technical
foul when, after an apparent
defensive goaltending infrac-
tion, he argued with head offi-
cial Jody Silvester to the point of
the technical call.

“I just asked for an explana-
tion,” Barnes said. “I didn’t
think that you could score a
basket at a rim that was pulled

and 12th in the 200 back-

“I like to think that my pres-
ence helped motivate the

a very self—motivating team,”
Brady said. “With or without

meet.”

The battle of speed — the

and Williams finished fourth.

Sophomore Chris Perry

placing second in the 100

Pitt put the exclamation

victory of the meet, winning
by 3.2 seconds over the sec-

mation point on all their vic-
tories this season, sending a
message to all their oppo-
nents.

“That is our goal — to crush
our opponents,” Brady said.
“We want to beat them in as
many different ways, by as
many points as possible.”

shaking.” ‘

“I thought it was a bad call
but I see a lot of them as bad
calls, so I’m not the best judge,”
Evans said.

McCullough hit both free
throws, Peterson connected on
a three-point play, and the
game was, for all intents and
purposes, over.

But, despite the 12-point win,
the game was not in hand until
late in the second half, when
Pitt’s inside attack, combined
with improved outside gunnery,
became just too much.

One of Pitt’s biggest fears
entering the game was how

their front line of three-man
Orlando Antigua, strong for-
ward Chris Gant and center Eric
Mobley would match up against
the Friars’ vaunted trio. But
despite the disappointing play
of Mobley, Gant, who had
recorded three straight double-
doubles, and the oft-over-
matched Antigua joined the pair
of newcomers to more than
handle their inside duties.

“I thought they really hurt us
on the board game,”_Barnes
said. “I think Gant is remarkably
improved.”

“I didn’t know Willie and
Jaime [Peterson] could rebound

as well as they did, but with Eric

and Gant I felt we were a little
better than them on the boards,”
McCullough said. ‘

Rookie sharp—shooter Sotiris
Aggelou also benefited from the
front line’s dominating play.
Aggelou finally found his
stroke, knocking down a pair of
second-half three-pointers, but
watched as the front line put
back shot after missed shot
early.

“After a layup and a basket
you get some confidence,”
Aggelou said.

But it was Cauley, whom
Evans said was too tight in the
upperbody because of _a lack of
