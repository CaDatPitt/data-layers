Interfraternity Ball
To Take Place Tonight

Fraternity men gather, for the first time this year, at their idea of a real
dance as the strains of Jack Miles and his “band of bands” ﬁll the Hotel Wil-
liam Penn ballroom. When Greek meets Greek tonight, it will be in stiff
shirts and silk lapels, long gowns and white gloves.

The Greeks, too, had a word for it, and while some people might think
the Word is “$3 a couple,” fraternity men are convinced it will be “entertain-
ing,” for, besides the orchestra's reputation for melodious and rhythmic music.

included in the novel program will
be a favor. To top on the aﬁair in
true society style, the music, with an
assortment of laughs and discreet
whoops of the dancers, will be broad-
cast over radio station KDKA from
12:30 to 1 o'clock.

Chairman Leroy Lewis predicts that
the dance will not only be truly rep-
resentative of the high type of func-
tion usually sponsored by the group,
but it will also reach the high tide
of school formals. He will lead the
grand march with Frances Lloyd at
10:30 o’clock, and dancing will con-
tinue until two.

The Interfraternity ball, annually
one of the ﬁnest dances on the Uni-
versity social calendar, climaxes a
brilliant fall season of dance affairs.
The $1 reservation tickets for the
dance may be exchanged today at the
office of the dean of men, 801, Cathe-
dral, between 9 and 5. o’clock, or at
the booth on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Alumni
Hall between 11 and 2 o'clock.

Chaperons for the dance include Mr.
and Mrs. Robert D. Ayars, Dr. and
Mrs. B, F. Stinchcomb, and Dr. Roy
Walters.

Tickets for the affair may still be
purchased from the members of the
committee: Bob Williams, Dave Im-
merman, Geo-rge Stocker, -Fritz
Guenter, Jules Green, Charles John-
son, Joseph Novak, Jack Brown, Mel-

Rushing Season 
To Open Monday

Men Begin Semi-Annual Season;
70 Freshmen Eligible

A small group of ﬁrst semester
freshmen, numbering not more than
seventy, will be the center of attrac-
tion for fourteen men’s social fra-
ternities during semi—annual rushing
season, opening at 8:30 o’clock Mon-
day morning,

No hectic round of dances, smokers
and parties will be in order during
the season, which closes at exactly 2
o’clock the following Sunday morn-
ing, February 25,

The fact that Washington’s birth-
day, a school holiday, falls in the
middle of the rushing week will give
fraternities the opportunity of spon-
soring dances the night of February
21. Usually mixed affairs are per-

Army Man Rebuifs Paciﬁst Stu-
dents At Inquiry Club- Session

Rebufﬁng a battery of paciﬁsts and
conscientious objectors to war, Lieu-
tenant-Colonel Fred A. Prince, chief
of the staff of the Ninety-ninth division
of the United States army, defended
his stand for an adequate national
defense. Colonel Prince, who is now
working with the CCC, said:

“The present student body will live
to see another war, Like the wars
of the past, it will not be started by
professional soldiers, at least not
those of our army. No United States
army officer ever precipitated a war;
it has always been brought on by our
politicians over problems involving
wealth and commerce.’

“Take the last war,” said Colonel
Prince, “the reasons Wilson gave for
entering the World war were just
words. We entered the war ‘to save
our own hides,’ and all the talk about
saving democracy for the world was
the bunk.”

The speaker claimed that “pacifist
agitation before the war had reduced
our army to such an extent that the
trained ofﬁcers who knew what it
was all about had to stay at home
and train the green, undisciplined re-
cruits. One half of the men who
were killed could have been saved
had they a chance to learn what
they should have known; as it was
they were cannon fodder.”

 

Student Loan Committee
Reports On Its Success

 

According to Louise Crispen, Ed34,
chairman of the student loan com-
mittee, iour students have been aided
in paying their tuition this semester.

Funds for these loans have been
obtained from profits of the candy
stands at Thaw hall and the Cath-
edral. Records of student loan show
that past loans have been repaid
regularly.

Scouts Name Leader

James J. Steiner, C37, has been
chosen squad leader of the Eagle
Scout Mounted troop, which holds its
second riding drill tonight in the
ﬁeld artillery armory on Emerson
street. Steiner has been an Eagle
scout for almost a year and has had
riding experience with the Brookline
Mounted Patrol.

mitted only on Friday and Saturday
nights.

The office of the dean of men, pre-
viously in the semester, prepared a
list of_all freshman in the university
not afﬁliated with fraternities, and
these lists will probably be used by
the Greek letter groups next week.
Many men whom fraternities neglect-
ed last semester to invite to rushing
affairs‘ should receive a share of the
invitations.

‘Track Trophy Is
Landed By Olson

Name Of Fraternity Winners To
Be Placed On Plaque

In the view of Coach Carl Olson
the trophy recently acquired by James
W. Hagan, graduate manager of ath-
letics, as a prize for the winners in
the annual indoor fraternity track
meet is one of the most beautiful
trophies offered in any college. “In

fact, I could say it’s the most beau-
tiful one I have ever seen anywhere,”
stated Coach Olson.

Consisting of a bronze plaque which
measures 12 inches by nine inches,
the trophy represents the efforts of
Mr. Hagan and Coach Olson. It is the
work of a. French sculptor, Vannier,
and was imported from France. A
modeled athlete, grasping a sword,
palm branch, and olive leaf in one
hand and a decorated shield in the
other, stands out in bold relief against
a background of the Olympic Stadium
at Paris, Minute details, even to run-
ners on the track, are worked out.

The plaque is mounted on a large
mahogany board above two silver
plates. One of these bears the in-
scription “University of Pittsburgh”
and the other reads “Annual Indoor
Track Meet.” Grouped about these
three pieces are 12 small silver plates
on whichwill be inscribed the name
of the fraternity winning the meet.

People USE Guns

UR EDITORIAL in tlie last is-
sue of the Pitt News com-
menting on the “war pictures”
which are appearing in downtown
papers has apparently branded
the editorial policy of the Pitt
News as one of “paciﬁsm” and of‘
disarmament.” It appears too that
many students on the campus support
our editorial viewpoint on the subject.
The Pitt News editorial policy IS
paciﬁstic and is in support of disar-
mament if such classiﬁcation places it
in opposition to war as an instrument
of national policy. We favor the pub-
lication of “war pictures” if the mo-
tive is to discourage people from be-
ing anxious to march on? and save the
world for democracy. We cannot sub-
scribe to “preparedness” as a. motive
for publishing war pictures. Such a
motive admits the inevitability of war
and admits that the United States
MUST ﬁght and must ﬁght SOON.
We do not care to admit that after
four years of university training, the
most intelligent and physically perfect
young men of our nation must be lined
up against a shell-torn horizon some-
where and killed. We cannot support

a national psychology that not only»
admits the possibility of war but-

in its very structure unwittingly fur-
thers the cause of such conﬂict.

We can see no reason for our na-
tion’s taking part in warfare. We can
see no reason why any nation should
send its best young men to be slaugh-
tered, as the pictures so well depict,
on foreign ﬁelds.

We believe that we should defend
our homes and our nation. Such a
course of action is not only logical,

Austria. No group of unarmed work-
guns and heavy shells of “Tiger” Doll-
fuss’ soldiers. Monsieur Dollfuss ap-
parently has control of the situation
and another dictator will be crowned
in Europe.

The events in Austria and through-
out Europe, with all of Mr. Dollfuss’
strutting, indicate to college students
that Fascism is a real force in world '
affairs at the moment. Most of our
campus colleagues who see no farther
than campus politics might be inter-
ested in Senor Dollfuss. Something
he might do in Austria might mean
that these same college students will
board transport steamers again and
sail off to ﬁght his Heimwehr, or
some other dictator’s soldier boys.

Druid Convention Here
N THE REORG-ANIZATION pro-
gram offered by the Druids in the
last issue of the News was included a
suggestion that the national Druids’
convention take place at the Univer-
sity this spring. A convention on the
Pitt campus will give the University
chapter the opportunity to reorganize
the entire national organization and to
take the leadership in national reform.

The report of the Investigations
committee showed that there was
i much to be desired in Druids’ national
leadership. It was indicated that the
organization had no central govern-
ing point and that the entire national
organization was in a state of neglect
and decay. Individual chapters were
falling away from the central group
and activities in individual chapters
showed a sharp decline.

Following the report of the Investi-
gations committee, the local chapter
of Druids revised its constitution and
changed its membership requirements.

‘but natural and long steeped in hu-
man heritage. But we feel that all
warships over the necessary mini-
mum, all “big Berthas" over the neces-
sary minimum, and all sta.nding ar-
mies over the necessary minimum are
useless, damaging to international
amity, and admit that nations are still
too childish to be intelligent, too
greedy to be honest, and too vain to
be sincere.

“Napoleon” Dollfuss
HE AGGRESSOR in the Austrian
civil war disturbances obviously is
pint-sized Chancellor Dollfuss who
has dreams of Fascist dictatorship
with himself as dictator of Austria.
Chancellor Dollfuss ordered his Heim-
wehr troops to storm the apartments
of the workers in Vienna, and the sol-

dier boys did a pretty job of it. It is .

a strange commentary that ninety per

cent of the soldiers in that same army ’

have fathers, and mothers, and broth-
ers who are members of that prole-
tariat.

Consistent with the philosophy of
people of the caliber of “Titan” Doll-
fuss, the murder of several thousand
innocent workers is a, small matter in
consideration of his rise in the eyes
of the world's eyes as “Dictator” Doll-
fuss. The power and courage of the
Socialist groups in Austria came as
suddenly as did the revelation that
Dollfuss’ mind is in proportion to his

body.
Senor Dollfuss is an interesting
gentleman, He has been too close to

men like Mussolini and Hitler not to
catch the Fascist fever. But the
fever has developed into delirium and
Senor Dollfuss, although he doesn't
know it, is a very sick man.

In all probability, Comrade Dollfuss
will become the Fascist dictator of

The group increased the scope of the
fraternity’s activities on the campus
and has shown considerable progress
since the report of the Investigations
committee.

It the Pitt chapter of Druids feels
that it can possibly bring the national
convention to the campus, it will
achieve for itself a position of leader-
ship in national Druid aﬁairs. Ed-
ward Durkin and his group of Druids
this year have the energy and enthus-
iasm to make drastic changes in na-
tional Druid organization. The Pitt
News and the campus are interested
in the strengthening of Druids. If
Pitt students will take the leadership
in this reform movement it will be a
notable achievement for the Pitt
group.

Freshman Swimming Team
Defeats Carrick 37-27

Coach George Lee's freshman swim-
ming team defeated Carrick High
school 37 to 27. Defeating Carrick
was by no means an easy task, for
Carrick is noted for its exceptionally
strong teams.

The freshman swimmers took ﬁrs!
in six of the eight events, but Car-
rick, besides taking two ﬁrsts, won
enough of the second and third places
to make it a very close meet.

The Carrick swimmers took first
and third places in the 50-yard race,
Heman of Carrick winning the event;
Geyer of Pitt ﬁnishing second, and
Heath of -Carrick winning third place.
Carrick won their other first place in
the 100-yard freestyle race, Heman
taking another ﬁrst and Clinton tak-
mg second, to give Carrick two places
in the 100-yard freestyle,

Moore gave the Panthers two ﬁrst
places, one in the 220 and the other
in the 100-yard backstroke. Faust won
the diving event and Muzyk won the
breaststroke, The Panthers won both
relays, the 200-yard freestyle relay as
well as the 150-yard medley relay to
account for six ﬁrst places. Keck,
Faust, Moore and Geyer made up the
winning freestyle relay and the med-
ley was won by Stiranka, Muzyk and
Faust.

Second Semester Fr

 

aternity Social Activities Show Mid-Season Momentum

By Rose Honig
Without the fanfare of trumpets and heralds carrying emblazoned ban-
ners, but with all the confused haste and hither-and-yon scrambling, the rush-
{mg period is getting under way. The siege began Monday with 17 women’s

fraternities sending the missiles of happiness to the fortunate ones.

And

-the problem before the hazy minds of the freshmen is not to prove a theorem

'-by axioms and previous theorems or

to get an idea for a freshman theme,

zbut to decide which invitation to accept and when.

So, the freshmen are racking th'eiz¢

‘brains as they go to and fro, while
the fraternity women are telephoning
the ingenious alumnae for inspiration-
al skits, leaﬁng through books with
deceptive titles proclaiming “life of
the party” stunts, and beseeching
sorors not to forget “Fraternity X”
wants their help, or rather, their
iorainstorms.

With rushing two weeks off, all
this mad rush is necessary, especially
for the fraternity women. As for the
rushees, “a stitch in time saves nine"
or maybe it’s “he who hesitates is
lost,” or something to that effect.

Many Track And Field Records Expected To Fall
Before Onslaught Of Varsity, Freshman Trackmen
In Annual Indoor Carnival Tomorrow Afternoon

A
T

Olson Awaits Banner
Turnout For Track
House Affair

All is in readiness for the united
assault upon the Track House records
by the Pitt trackmen tomorrow. The
time of the meet has been moved up
from the evening, as was previously
announced, to 1:30 in the afternoon.
Novices, varsity and freshman per-
formers have been practicing hard all
week for the event. _

At some time or other during their
daily workouts, the boys have stopped
long enough to read the ﬁgures on
the huge black sign board which
bears the Pitt indoor records in all
freshman and varsity events. All of
which may mean that Olson’s sign-
painter is going to have a busy time
stenciling in some new ﬁgures and
names next week, if all goes well.

Six marks, at least, are certain to
go. These are the 40-yard dash, the 45-
yard low hurdles and the 45-Yard high
hurdles in both the varsity and fresh-
man lists. The hurdles and the dashes
will now be 50 yards in length, thus
whatever performances which are
turned in for these events tomorrow
automatically become records.

Five of the eleven record-holders in
the varsity list will be eligible to com-
pete in tomorrow’s games. Two of
these, Fleming and Keller, each lay
claim to two record marks. Thiessen,
Pelucha and Bonavita will also be out
to keep their names on the board for
another year.

Last year was the ﬁrst year in
which freshman records were kept,
which means that they have not yet
stood the test of competition. Mc-
Munn and Scott, who both set up two
marks last year for future ﬁrst-year
men to shoot at, will likely push the
varsity men hard in their specialties,
Scott’s last year’s mark in the hop,
step and jump was three feet better
than the varsity record and its al-
most a sure bet that the varsity mark
will fall.

Of this year’s crop of freshmen,
Tost and Avizienis appear most likely
to better the efforts made last season
in freshman events. Tost will com-
pete in the distance runs while Aviz-
ienis appears certain to hang up a
new record in the shot put.

Judges for the meet will be univer-
sity faculty men. Every one is in-
vited to the meet and there is no
charge. Since the seating capacity of
the Track House is about 200, it is
urged that spectators arrive before the
opening time of the meet, 1:30, so
that they may secure seats for the
carnival.

Matmen To Show
At Morgantown

 

 

West Virginia Host To Panther
Grapplers Tomorrow Evening

Tomorrow night at 8 o’clock the
Panther wrestlers will meet the West
Virginia Mountaineers at Morgantown
for the Pitt team’s second collegiate
match of the season. In their ﬁrst
match they lost a close match to
Washington and Jefferson, 21 to 13.

The Pitt team has been strength-
ened considerably since the W. & J.
match. Mike Nicksick has ﬁlled the
hitherto vacant 175-pound berth and
the team as a whole is in better physi-
cal condition than it was at the time
of the ﬁrst match.

The starters in two of the weight
classes are as yet uncertain. Either
Thiessen or Evans will wrestle in the
118-pound class, and in the 155-pound
class it has not been decided whether
Cox or Conley will start, .

The other weight divisions are
fairly certain. Paul Hinchberger will
wrestle in the 125-pound division, Al-
bert Barr in the 135-pound class, Cap-
tain Bradford Ilsley in the 145-pound
class, Arthur Willets in the 165-pound
match, Mike,Nicksick in the 175-pound
class, and Arthur Detzel will ﬁll in
the heavyweight position.

This year the University will spon-
sor a freshman wrestling team. A
tentative schedule has ben drawn up
calling for meets with other frosh
teams as well as local high school
teams. Any student desiring to try
out for the team in any of the follow-
ing weight classes: 115, 125, 135, 145,
155, 165, 175, and heavyweight is re-
quested to report to the Stadium
dressing room any day this week
after 2:30 o’clock.

Boxers To Stage
Exhibition Bouts

Team’s Strength Handicapped By
Lack Of Material

 

The members of the varsity and
freshman boxing teams have been in-
vited to put on exhibition bouts be-
fore a group of alumni tonight in
Latrobe. Coach Orsini will take along
his entire squad, insuring the grads of
plenty of entertainment,

The boxing team took another blow
from lady luck in the bouts with Du-
quesne, aside from losing the match.
Joe Kopp, Varsity 165-pounder, suf-
fered a broken hand in his bout, which
will keep him out for the season.
Kopp’s injury now leaves three ab-
solute vacancies in the Panther box-
ing lineup. Aside from the 175-pound
class Orsini has no performers for
the 115 or 125-pound divisions.

Any students desirous of trying out
for the three vacant positions, as well
as any other weight class, is requested
to report to Coach Orsini any day
next week in the Stadium dressing

Gold en Panthers
Play Notre Dame
In Return Game

Westminster Heads List Of Foes
Remaining On Schedule;
Five Games Are Abroad

 

Playing on a foreign floor for the
first time in two months, the Golden
Panthers will meet Notre Dame’s ﬁne
quintet at South Bend tomorrow night.
This will be Pitt’s second western
trip of the current season, the ﬁrst
being the three-game series played
in the midwest early in December.
The Panther freshman team will
travel to Duquesne to meet Duquesne
High there.

The Panthers will run up against
a ﬁghting Irish team, which is deter-
mined to gain revenge for the classy
39-34 defeat Pitt handed them on the
local ﬂoor last month. Although that
loss broke the sensational Notre-
Dame victory streak, the South Bend-
ers have picked up right where they
left off and have been sweeping
through all opposition,

Once again the fate of the battle
seems to rest upon the shoulders of
the centers of the two teams. Big Ed
Krause is the main cog in the Notre
Dame offense and if Claire Cribbs can
handle him as effectually on the Notre
Dame ﬂoor as he did here, then the
game is very likely to result in a Pitt
Victory.

In addition to the regular starting
ﬁve, Noon, Roderick, »Wainio, Kuno
and either Bond or Nickel will make
the trip with Coach ‘Carlson and Man-
ager Wettach.

This game will provide the greatest
attraction in the mid-west for the
week-end. It may be recalled that
last year the Irish came through for
a victory after losing a similar early
season encounter to the Panthers on
the Pitt ﬂoor. The Panthers, how-
ever, appear to have hit a real stride
at the present and Notre Dame will
have to play a lot of basketball to
lick them.

While the Pitt boys have ﬁve more
games abroad this season, including
four contests in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate conference, but one other
home game remains on the Panther
schedule. This game is the one re-
cently scheduled with the high-riding
Westminster Titans and will be

played Wednesday night at the’

Stadium. The district basketball
championship hangs in the offing for
the winner of this battle.
Westminster, generally boasting
wonderfully strong basketball teams,
appears to have the crack outﬁt of
them all this year. The Titans have
lost but one game thisseason, this
being to Duquesne in a heart-break-
ing 35-31 affair. They nosed out
Duquesne in the return engagement

just before the Panthers also took the ,

measure of the Dukes, All of which

leaves both teams with one victory:
and one defeat as far as Duquesne is ’

concerned, with the added notice that

men in the second game.

Once again the Panthers will have ‘

to watch the opposing center if they
are to win out.

topping off his scoring with a 26-point

Panther Cagers
Plan Trip South

Pitt’s basketball players are going
to keep playing basketball for some
time after the close of the regular
season, according to plans being laid
by head coach, Dr. H. C. Carlson.
These extra games will not give the
student books added value, however,
inasmuch as they will be played in
southern climes,

At the national convention of the
National Association of Basketball
Coaches, in Atlanta, Georgia, during
the Easter vacation, where several
teams will perform in exhibition
games, the Panthers are to represent
the north. Illinois Wesleyan will be
there to represent the mid-west and a
team is expected from the Missouri
valley section. A southern ball club
will be on hand, of course.

Plans for the Panther invasion of
the south are as yet indeﬁnite beyond
the fact that the trip will be made
by automobiles and will include a
party of nine players along with
Coaches Carlson and Kowallis. Pitt is
dickering for games with several
schools along the way so that the
boys can keep in trim. Duke univer-
sity has already accepted and North
Carolina State will probably arrange
to meet the Carlsonmen. The length
of this barnstorming schedule will
naturally determine the length of time
for the trip, as the boys and Carlson“
who is secretary-treasurer of the
NABC, must reach Atlanta for the
opening date of the convention, March
29. The conclave will run until March

Swimming Team
  In AMA Meet

Crack Relay Teams Aim At
Records Saturday Night

The Allegheny Mountain associa-
tion record for the 400-yard relay
race is likely to be lowered Saturday
night, in a swimming meet which will
take place in the Keystone pool, when
four strong contending Pitt teams hit
the water,

Coach Pat Corr has placed his four
fastest 100-yard men on one team,
which places the present record in a
perilous position. The team, composed
of Jack Denny, Herman Adlersberg,
Jack Hanna and Russell Lindberg, will
undoubtedly be the fastest quartet en-
tered and stands a good chance of
setting a new record.

Two other varsity teams, one com-
posed of Charles Chambers, Joseph
Madden, Charles Ruhe and Paul Stin-
ner, and the other made up of Joe
Jones, Vvilliam Lewis, Joseph Schmeil-
er and William Swazuk, will give any
other district teams plenty of com-
petition for runner-up position.

The fourth Pantherteam entered
will be composed entirely of freshmen
from George Lee’s team. Although the
frosh lack experience, some of them
never having had any competitive
swimming, the four members, Geyer,
Moore, Keck and Meyers, will push
other teams in the heats, and may
even reach the ﬁnals.

Book Exchange Service
Center To Be Changed

*-

 

Rose Honig, chairman of the book
exchange committee, announces that
the book exchange ﬁles will be lo-
cated at Alumni hall until today at
3 o’clock. The ﬁles will then be avail-
able only at Heinz House. The com-
mittee members urge the students
who have bought or sold the books on
ﬁle to notify them, in order that the
ﬁles be freed of useless card-s.

sity of Cincinnati, Georgetown univer-
sity, Washington university, Univer-
sity of Illinois, University of Mary-
land, Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute,

will be conducted as shoulder to
shoulder matches. Each school com-
peting will mail their score to every

into action for the ﬁrst time this
year, The ROTC matches will be con-
ducted in the same manner as are!
the Varsity team matches.

lege, Kansas State college, Lehigh
university, North Dakota Aggies and
Valley Forge ‘Military academy.

The ten highest scorers in matches
which took place between team mem-
bers are the men who will shoot in
the collegiate and ROTC matches.

were: Zoller, Frabatta, Davis, Weit-
ershausen, Mastrucci, A. Duff, Hykes,
J, Duff, Atkinson and Miller.

  The Campus Scoutl

Track, at Pitt, has never received the support it deserved from the

student ‘body in general. Last year,

however, saw some interest being re-

vived in the sport that is rated very high at practically every major college‘

but Pitt. The reason for this sudden

change was the fact that a gentleman

from Iowa, Carl Olson, was brought in to take charge of things and make the‘-

New York, and Michigan State col- ‘

wheels go ’round.

The results, to the surprise of a great many people who don’t expect‘

results for a few years, were surpris 9, -

ing, to say the least. For one thing,

undecided, The Panthers, under car

the track team began to move out of Dame C03-Chiﬂg. appeal‘ Capable of Put-’

the tri-state area, and participated in
such famous meets as the Armour
Tech and Penn Relays. At the Penn
Relays, particularly, the Panther
sprinters were impressive.

This year, the most ambitious sched-
ule ever placed before a Pitt track
team, confronts Coach Olson and his
“boys.” The indoor meet at West
Virginia last week, which featured
some of the best track teams in the
country, saw the Panther trackers tie
for the unofficial championship with
the strong Michigan State team. How-
ever, that was only the beginning.

The remainder of the indoor sea-
-son, includes‘ meets with West Vir-
ginia, the ICAAAA meet at New York,
the CIC meet at Notre Dame, the
Armour Tech and the Butler Relays.
The outdoor season, which gets under
way on April 21, with Pitt playing
host to Temple at the Stadium, in-
cludes meets with Penn State, West
Virginia, Carnegie Tech, and Notre
Dame. Sandwiched among these
meets is the NCAA meet, the Penn
Relays, and the Second Annual handi-
cap university track and ﬁeld meet.

The make-up of the team, as yet, is

‘ting a very strong team in the ﬁeld.-
‘ In the shorter dashes, Coach olson can
call on Fleming, Menaker, Jacobson,
and M,cMunn. In the longer dashes,
we ﬁnd Keller, Kiger, McDonald, Kirk-
patrick, and Connelly. Wagenhouser,
Kirkpatrick, Musico, Cook, and Law-
rence head the mile and two mile
candidates, Good, Sawiski, Guay,
Thiessen, and Fleming are the most
likely hurdlers.

Pitt is exceptionally well favored in
the ﬁeld events. Bonavita heads the
group of good weight men that in-
cludes Gongloff and Wilkins. The
broad jumping is capably handled by
Scott, Rooker, Good, Fleming, and Se-
bastian. Atkinson and Good in the
high jump, and Pelucha, O’Dell, and
Erickson in the pole vault round out
a well balanced team.

The second annual indoor champion-
ships at the Track House tomorrow
afternoon is a good chance for inter-
ested Pitt boosters to get a “line” on
the team. But, don’t stop with watch-
ing. Vvhether you have track talent-
or not, introduce yourself to a good
coach, and a swell fellow, Carl Olson.
Above all, you can't lose if you ‘.‘take

a crack at track.”
