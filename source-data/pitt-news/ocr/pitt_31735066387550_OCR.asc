Pitt sponsors P/\/IS

By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer

The Premenstrual Syndrome
Program is the newest faction of
Healthsource, a women's pro-
gram sponsored jointly by Magee
Women's Hospital and the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine and School of Psy-
Chiatry.

Healthsource focuses on phys~
ical and emotional problems en-
countered by women.

Some of their programs include
smoking cessation, behavioral
weight control, victim counsel-
ing, and premenstrual syndrome.

Entering the PMS program,
however, requires that a woman,
who believes she suffers from
PMS, apply before ‘being ad-
mitted. .

According to Judith Thoft,
spokeswoman for the PMS pro-

  programfor women

gram, "She must record two
months of daily symptoms using
ourrating forms. Out of about
100 packets we might send out,
maybe 50 will be return complet-
ed with two months of informa-
tion. Once we get a packet we
check to see if it fits PMS.”
Healthsource defines PMS as
’’association of physical and

emotional symptoms which typi— -
ically increase in severity during

the latter stages of each menstru-
al cycle and disappear during
menstruation."

After screening the packet, the
woman will be asked to come in
for a private consultation and join
a group usually with an average
of six people.

This program focuses on be-

havioral changes in the lifestyle '

to combat the symptoms of PMS.

A Gorbachev tightening screws for Soviet citizens

MOSCOW —— Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged
SovietCommunist Party workers
on Tuesday to enthusiastically
support his reform policies or get
out of the way of those who do.

Speaking to party workers at
the Smolny Institute in Leningrad,
which was Lenin's headquarters
during the Bolshevik Revolution,

‘ Gorbachev also said that despite
some excesses more openness
and freer criticsm was essential.

His 90-minute, nationally tele-
vised speech was dedicated
almost entirely to domestic poli-
cy and appeared to contain no
significantly new material.

It came weeks before the coun-
try celebrates the 70th anniver-
sary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The official news agency Tass_
said Gorbachev later left for
Moscow.

Gorbachev said the Com-
munist Party does not want wor-
kers who do not want to work
with people.

Drawing a comparison to Chi-
na's Cultural Revolution of 20
years ago, the Soviet Communist

did not want to turn people

‘against party workers.

But he said party officials who
are uncomfortable with his re-
forms and cannot change are an
obstacle, and that the party
should get rid of them.

French landmark to

get needed repairs

PARIS — An international fund-
raising campaign was launched
Tuesday to restore the ailing Arch
of Triumph, which now sits
swaddled in diaper—|ike netting to
keep chunks of stone from falling
on tourists visiting the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier.

The role of American money in
preserving the monument, com-
missioned by Napoleon in 1806
to glorify his battlefield victories,
has sparked protests from French
nationalists.

But leaders in the campaign,
headed by former President
Valery Giscard d’Estaing, said
funds from any source would be
welcome.

The first check received was for

$50 from Hugh McMahon, a
World War II veteran from Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.

of bystanders and reporters. Pho-

PHILADELPHIA — A former
president of a powerful transpor-

ently shot himself while playing
Russian roulette in his home,
police said.

fore he apparently shot himself.
According to Hansen, ”The
father says to the son, ’I’m going
to play Russian roulette to show

you I still have guts."’

PMS, but there are a lot of the-
ories,” said Thoft. She cautioned
against clinics that offered
”cures” for women who suffer.

’’Only after completing the pro-
gram with no improvement
would we advocate medicine,”
said Thoft. “We feel it is better to
start out conservatively.”

Some of the changes that the
programs focus on is eating and
stress management. Research has
shown certain foods increase the
symptoms while others lessen
them. , ‘

One of the seminars help the
women choose their foods more
closely. The stress management
session allows the women to pin-
point different areas of stress in
their lives and find ways to either
avoid this stress or to better han-
dle it.

Another session includes deep
muscle relaxation training. ”This
is a specific technique. where
people are trained to relax mus-
cles until there is an actual phys-
iological change,” said Thoft.

This relaxation technique helps
to relieve anxiety and depression

while removing some of the ten- M,
g sion in the body. , ' .

These sessions meet once__a ,-
week in their small groups and] '

continue to do so for five weeks-.

Following the five weeks, thereis _ 
another individual consultation. .. 
_ According to Thoft,.it is in thiisf-g.
last session that the progress of. V 

the women is assessed. If they

have progressed and relieved

some of their PMS symptoms,
they will continue to meet once
a month in groups. .

Thoft reported, ”Over- 50 per-
cent of the women with severe

symptoms benefit from this ' Hi

program."
For those that don't, Health-
source follows up with examin-

ing other possible answers for the"

patient.

Although the program only has 
been running for a year, three ._ .

ing formed.

Neurologist studies
Alzheimer's disease

By Mark R. Brown

Staff Writer

Alzheimer's disease cripples
countless elderly people annual-
ly, slowly stealing their ability to
function cognitively. Neurologist
Donald L. Rezek is one man who
is attempting to make discoveries
to change this. He is very active
and committed to research in
diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease.

Also known as ”dementia of
the Alzheimer type,” this malady
impairs the cognitive functions of
elderly people. The saddest
aspect is that those afflicted are
not aware of the illness.

”Historically speaking, this dis-
ease was known as either ’pre—
senile dementia’ if the patient
was younger than 65 and ‘senile
dementia’ if the patient was older
than 65,” said Rezek, who works
for the Department of Neurology,
Western Psychiatric lnstitue and
Clinic, the Benedum Center and
the VA Hospital. He received his
grant from the National Institute

In his research here at Pitt, Re-
zek tests the sense of smell of
mildly demented patients and a
control group of healthy, elderly
people. He uses diluted solutions
of cinnamon oil, lemon, ground
coffee, peppermint and turpen-
tine. His patients were tested for
identification and recognition of
the odors. After sniffing the stimu-
lus, the patients had to select the
name of the odor from a list,
which included the five
fragrances and five other odors.

”Olfactory studies fit into other
preliminary findings with the
general population. My work is
more specific — regarding

decreased sense of smell,” said V

Rezek, who has been interested
in researching Alzheimer's dis-
ease since his fellowship at
Washington University in. St.
Louis in 1985.

’’In the past, Alzheimer's could
only be detected through an au-
topsy. Cortical dementia mainly
affects the grey matter of the
brain, and changes in the white
matter do not follow,” said
Rezek.

According to Rezek, ”Odor
identification is more difficult
than odor recognition, both for
normal and dementing elderly.
The use of a list of choices has
been to help compensate for
differences caused by a cognitive
deficit. ’

"The victim of Alzheimer's sel-
dom recognizes or admits the
change in sense of smell. If not
recognized, dementia and olfac-
tory disturbance could jeapordize
the person's “health [through] for
example, failure to detect a gas
leak or food spoilage,” reported
Rezek. .

Rezek said that people with
Down’s syndrome can get Alz-
heimer’s disease as young as in
the early 50s and that olfactory
deficiencies are also associated
with head trauma, Korsakoff’s dis-
ease and Parkinsonism.

Does where you're born make
you a human? Your political
system? What your news agen-

truth as it's taught to you?
That's a start, but the truth is,
there's something of God in
every person. And that's what
really makes a human being.

WE BELIEVE IN ONE GREAT -
NATION . . . a nation under
God that is not just the United
States, but which is indepen-
dent of human made borders.
George Fox, who founded the
Quakers, told us, "Vi/alk cheer-
fully over the world, answering
that of God in every‘ one."
Many Friends have -— in ghet-

.Mutabaruka uses reggae to convey message

      

 

Wednesday, October I4, I987

  

  

 

I - By Mark R. Brown

Staff Writer

Reggae. Rastafari. Jamaica.

These words illicit visions in our ‘

minds of shaggy-maned islanders,
swaying without form to an easy

 drum beat, sometimes stoned on

high-grade ganja.

\i There was no ganja in the air

at Graffiti last Monday night, but
there were lots of dreadlocked
Rastas in attendance to welcome

Mutabaruka and the Sounds of
' Resistance, along with warm—up
band Chi/I Factor and Reggae ar-

tist Norris Reid. ,
. Mingling with the crowd be-

I fore the show was interesting,

seeing old acquaintances and

. V friends. Since reggae music pro-

motes love and peace, the at-
mospheregpresent in Graffiti was
a refreshing mix of Rastas and
yuppies, laidback people who
came to unwind for a few hours
to the hypnotic beat of reggae
bass and drums.

After putting in an eight-hour
day of studying or hard work, it's
nice to lose oneself to the picture
painted by the singer's lyrics.

The Chill Factor was the warm-
up band, apparently with a grow-
ing local following. I'm uncertain
how long that “they've been
together, but the group has a
young sound to it. They took .a
few songs to warm up to their
present potential, which I'm sure
will improve with the addition of
new sound equipment and

66

Reggae is the voice of
the oppressed and
repressed. It causes
contentment in this
world. — Mutabaruka

maybe a few more band
members.

There was a marked improve-
ment in the sound quality when

singer Norris Reid got on stage

with an accompanying guitar
player.

Reid, from Jamaica, is definite-
Iy a good reggae artist, and it's go-

ing to be interesting to keep an
eye on his success. He comes on
stage with a distinct presence,
cajoling the listener with his lyr-
ics and his antics which would do
credit to a karate kickboxer.

Nobody sleeps through his act,
and he was on stage for only
three songs. Reid brought a
higher level of energy to the
stage, rhythmy and very Car-
ribean.

The group that drew most of
the crowd was Mutabaruka and
the Sounds of Resistance, late of
Jamaica. This was their second
appearance here in “Pittsburgh.
From the response of the au-
dience, it’s easy to say that it

‘won't be soon enough until

they're back again.

Win! Win! Win!

With seven people on stage,
and the Sounds of Resistance was
good from the very first note. The
band opened up with a long
acoustic ramble, guaranteed to
spark the audience's adrenaline.
At the end of the first song, the
lights dimmed, and Mutabaruka
ascended the stage.

As Mutabaruka is fond of say-
ing, ”Reggae is the voice of the
oppressed and repressed. It
causes contentment in this
world.”_ He's right. This
singer/guitarist/poet had the au-
dience’s attention without any
lapse. With each song played, an
increasing number of people
flocked to the dance floor.

Brooks
performs
his blues

By Robin Shepherd

Staff Writer

Last night, patrons of The De-
cade were treated to a rare per-
formance of genuine blues by
one of America's premier blues

artists, guitar player Lonnie

Brooks. Brooks’ current tour coin-
cides with the recent release of
his album, Wound Up Tight. I
had the opportunity to talk with
Brooks about his musical in-
fluences and his outlook on the
contemporary blues scene.

Q: You were born in Louisiana
but later went to Chicago. Were
you more influenced by
Southern-based blues or the
Chicago sound?

A: Well, I was raised in Texas,
so I was more influenced by tradi-
tional Southern blues — Lightnin’
Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, Mud-
dy Waters. I didn't go to Chica-
go till 1959.

Q: Have you played with many
other major blues artists?

A: Oh, I've been in shows with
all of them. In Chicago in the
'60s, I played with Muddy Waters
and Howlinf Wolf, before they
died. I also played with BB. King
a lot and Albert King. More re-
cently, l’ve performed with Stevie
Ray Vaughn. I rea|ly-enjoy work-
ing with Stevie Ray. He's real
good.

Q: Were you surprised at the
recent mainstream success of
Robert Cray’s album, Strong Per-
suader?

A: Surprised? No, I wasn't sur-
prised at- all because he's real
good. He's a good guy, and he's
real serious.

Q: Your newest album, on Al-
ligator Records, is Wound Up
Tight. How does it differ from
your previous LPs?

A: Well, for the most part it's
the same style but with more of
a rock feel to it. Also, this one has
a ballad on it. |

Q: Do you enjoy singing as
much -as guitar playing?

A: Yeah, I love ’em both. I love
singing. I don't have any unique
style. I just do it. -

Q: Have you been to Pitts-
burgh before? i

 A;-.oh;»yes. t’.tr1=g1ad-to.t:ebat;l<.;.

Smiths take a strange way

The Smiths

Strangeways, Here We Come
Sire

The first thing that came to
mind when the Smiths new al-
bum came out was that they were
going to bore me to death with
another humdrum monotone al-
bum with Morrissey whining.

Thankfully, though, they
manage to get Morrissey to sing
on much of the album, as well as
sound peppy on quite a few of
the tracks.

Strangeways, Here We Come
may be where many long-time
Smiths fans think these guys are
headed, especially if you try to
take them seriously — apparent-
ly something that the band mem-
bers do. There has to be a morbid
streak in these guys that runs very
deep, for not any group would _
tackle such songs as ”Death of a
Disco Dancer,” ”Girlfriend in a
Coma” and ”Unhappy Birth-
day,” — which, by the way, ar-

en't as brooding as they might
sound.

Indeed/‘Girlfriend in a Coma”
(like many Smiths songs) is quite
upbeat and happy—sounding if the
lyrics are ignored. The song could
probably have been a break-
through for them onto the play-
lists ofmajor radio stations if it
weren't so short — it doesn’t'last
long enough to develop into any-
thing more substantial than -a
catchy chorus and a polite-
sounding acoustic guitar.

The two songs that make the al-
bum worth its weight in vinyl are
”A Rush and a Push and the Land
is'Ours” and ”Stop Me if You
Think You've Heard This One
Before.” ”A Rush” is pretty much
dominated by a perky piano in
the background that weaves its
way in and out of the refrain.

”Stop Me” is the second best
tune on the disc and easily makes
the five songs that follow it bear-
able. Morrissey could easily have
cried the lines in this song out,

yet he chooses to sing them. This 
does the song well, as the theme 3_;
— someone falsely accused of ly- 5?
ing — is fairly refreshing instead ’
of downcast, a turn far too many
Smiths songs tend to take.

Although the album definitely
has its share of classic Smith
lamentations, they fortunately do
not dominate the album.

According to Tim Van Gelder,
people who think that the Soviets
are expansionistic think with their
guts. What does Mr. Van Gelder
think with? Perhaps he thinks
with what he sits on.

To suggest that the Soviets ar-

’ en’t expansionistic flies in the

face of history, one need only ask
people of Soviet Central Asia, Lat-
via, Estonia, Lithuania, the
Ukraine or Afghanistan. Since Le-

_nin, Soviet leaders have talked of

world domination and have
voiced their support for ”|ihera-
tion movements” (read Marxist
guerrilla movements) around the
world.

If cheating on the arms agree-

’ ment is un—Russian as Mr. Van

Gelder asserts, then Lenin and his
Bolshevik party's rise to power is
also un—Russian for they lived by
the rule of divide and conquer us-
ing their uninhibited demagogy

to destroy their political op-'

ponents.

I suggest that Mr. Van Gelder

WILLIAM
YOUNG

Coming before Congress soon
is a bill designed by our illustri-
ous President Reagan which
seeks to give $270 million to
10,000 rebel soldiers in
Nicaragua. There have been few

"3;-:.*r.‘:’l:'l\bills that have been more

ridiculous than this one, and I
suspect that it will not go through

_ as written.

The main problem with this bill

’ is that the Contras are not worth

$270 million because they don't
deliver. If you've been keeping
track of the six year war the Con-
tras have supposedly been en-
gaged in with Ort_ega's

 government, you'd realize that ,

accomplished nothing.

They have yet to capture a city,
sway the public or gain any
ground inside Nicaragua —
which is why they spend most of
their time in Honduras. They are
a monumental waste of effort on
the part of the United States. How

any government officials believe

that a somewhat disciplined
group of disaffected ex-Samoza
supporters who have no political
ideology except anti-communism
can win a war against the regu-
lar Nicaraguan army is beyond
me.

The basic premise for support-
ing the Contras is because they
are anti-communist and that
Nicaragua is a junior member of
the Soviet empire threatening the

V_ peace and stability of all of.

confirmation to the Supreme
Court by those who do not agree
with his-opinions. However, all
that I find as odd are your reasons
for supporting the nominee.
You state that with so many un-
qualified people occupying fed-
eral positions, a strong reason for
confirming Justice Bork is that he
possesses the requisite education-
al and professional background.
Now I will agree with you that
good help is hard to find.
However, filling the position of
Supreme Court Justice is not quite
the same as filling a job at the
Post Office (no disrespect intend-
ed). Since the position of
Supreme Court Justice is one of
the most prestigious in the nation,
it seems likely that a relatively
high number of other well quali-
fied, less decisive individuals
could be_induced to take the job.

You also state that while you

right to have his own opinion and
apparently believe that a mere
difference in opinion is not rea-
son enough to deny confirma-
tion. I too respect Justice Bork’s
‘right to have his own opinion.

However opposition to Justice J

Bork is not based on a desire to
deny the nominee the right to
have his own opinion. Rather it
is a desire to prevent him from

Sure, I realize the potential of
the domino effect in Central
America, but this is a non-
problem that could be easily
nipped in the bud if the threat
ever materialized. Central Ameri-
ca is only a stone's throw from
the United States, so the risk of
a conflict that would go beyond
U.S. capability to keep it under
control is unlikely. This is be-
cause supplies from other com-
munist nations have a long way
to go to get there, and the Russi-
ans, Cubans, or whoever might
be interested, are not likely to
send troops to bolster the area
when it's probable they'd never
arrive. The threat of war in the

Consumeritis: an inflamed report

 

ELLEN
GOODMAN

The woman is standing in the
drugstore suffering from acute
consumeritis. The attack has been
brought on by the excess of

choices on the shelf before her. "

Its chief symptom is mental paral-
ysis, the total inability to make a
decision. -

The woman did not expect that
a simple trip to the drugstore
would bring such a disease. But
this is not your old time drugstore
with soda fountain and jerk. This
is a mega-drug store with acres of
offerings for things to put on and
in the human body. Each part of
the anatomy — from the toe and
its corns to the fingernail and its
polish — has been allotted its
very own half—acre.

A dolphin, a librarY anda headache

RICHARD
POZZIITO

Once upon a time, I wandered
into Hillman Library for no rea-
son other than that is where my
feet carried me. This happens to
me periodically. My ego just kind
of checks out, and whatever’s left
takes over. My five senses work,
but the empirical information
they provide doesn't get

A processed quite the same way.

Anyway, I'm in Hillman
Library, and I go to a table and
find a wayward Omni magazine
lying there. I flipped it open and

settled on anarticle about dol-

phins. As I read my conscious-
ness deteriorated further. I stared
blankly at the final period of the
final paragraph for a long time, it
seemed. “

My body stood, and my feet
carried me out the door; I tried to
think about what I had read, but
the ability to think was missing.
I went back into the library to try
to trick myself into remembering
what I had read. I walked past the
table where I sat and noticed that
the Omni was missing. Icould
feel sweat forming on my brow.
There was a tightening in my
stomach. I felt conspicuous, like
I had -just screamed at the top of
my lungs, and everybody was
frozen and staring at me. I won-
dered if I had screamed.

. My feet carried me to the stair-’
. well leading to the second floor. '

    
  
 
   

At the moment of acute con-
sumeritis, the woman in question
is in the space devoted to the
head. She came here on a quest
for a refill of shampoo. But when
her usual brand was no longer
available, she was tossed willy-

- nilly into the chaos of the modern

day world of shampoos.

What did she want after all?
Which of the three dozen options
lined up before her would make
the dead follicles that grow out of
her busy head come alive? A
moisturizing formula? A body-
building protein? A mysterious
chemical soup of elastin? Colla-
gen? Keritin? Balsam?

She was compelled ,,_by the.
labels to askjherself some

penetrating questions. Was she
the sort of person who needed
her Ph balanced? Or would she
prefer her Ph a bit off kilter?
Should she put essential fatty
acids in her scalp? Or would they
be bad for the cholesterol? Did
she want a shampoo with a pec-
tin extract? Or wasn't that what
she uses to make jelly?

To her shock, this woman who
earns her living making deci-
sions, who knows and says what
she thinks of baby M, Robert
Bork and the meaning of life, was
having a shampoo identity crisis.
Holding two products aloft, she
finally turned in panic to a per-
fect stranger next to her and

could still see, however, and I
was elated over this. All other
sensation seemed vestigial. As I
exited the stairwell, I was happy
— very happy. I strolled through-

“out the bookstacks aimlessly,

when it occurred to me that on
the other side of the stacks, there
was a dolphin walking upright
like a man. Obviously a dolphin

» with_an agenda, I though_t.

, The constriction in my stomach
returned, and I began to sweat

‘ profusely. My vision blurred, and‘

I deduced that tears were form-
ing in my eyes. My throat undu-
lated, I gasped for air  I was
crying. \

Out of the corner of my eye, I
saw down the narrow walk space
at the end of the bookstack, a fin
break through a glass encasement
of a fire-extinguisher and hatch-
et. As I turned to look squarelyat
what was going on, I met the cold.
black eyes of a grey; bottle-nosed
dolphin. Immediately, mysenses
returned and with them full
knowledge of the dolphin’s "hid-
den” agenda. -

I left the library immediately
and without further incident.

I know now that the dolphin
wanted tocut my head off, so he
could sew his head to my body.
It was 7:45 p.m. and time to go
to my AA meeting. As I headed
for the meeting on the 61B, I
wandered what I would look like

with a dolphin head. The image ,
I conjured up made me laugh out *

loud —— which I hate doing on
buses, people think you're crazy

asked: ”Tell me, is my hair nor-
mal or dry?”

With that our subject broke. Af-
ter a few brief catatonic mo-
ments, she turned from the
startled stranger, she sped back
through the mega-drugstore. She
passed the half—mile devoted to
teeth without once considering
whether she wanted tartar control
in her toothpaste or cinnamon
flavor in her dental floss. She
nearly vaulted over the checkout
counter.

Home again, in the quiet of her
shower, pouring her daughter's
leftovers over her scalp, it oc-
cured to her that she had learned
a good deal about the pitfalls of
the modern consumer world. The
proliferation of personal products
had" turned shopping into a deci-
sion making marathon. The com-
peting claims of manufacturers,
the specialties and sub-
specialties, had produced_.an in-
formation glut. '

Informed consumers are now
expected to coinpare the claims
and ingredients, not to mention
the unit pricing, of hundreds of
everyday products. More to the
point, they are propelled into ex-
amining their bodies in ever more
minute detail. Does my skin need
intensive care or none?gDo I have
plaque on‘ my teeth or not?
Ridges on my nails? Split ends on
my hair? Am I normal or dry?

too. I calmed down and won-
dered how I could do drag with
-a dolphin head.’ Finding a wig
would be impossible. I wouldn't
be able to wear earrings unlessl

glued them to the side of the

head or attached them to the wig
somehow. And I'd use up an en-
tire tube of lipstick in one night.

I thought about why the dol-

phin hadlresorted to paranormal '

subterfuge to lure me into the
bookstacks and why he desired to
leave his ocean life for a terrain
one. A sense of compassion
welled up in me, and the con-
tents ofthe article came back to
me. It had all the usual stuff about
the dolphin’s superior intel_li-
gence and rich emotional life. It

- my will over to his.

It's bad enough that the drift of
all this is toward an excessive
self-a_bsorbtion. We are also led .
to believe that picking one bot-
tle over another is an important,
meaningful decision. Maybe as
citizens we don't have much con-
trol over our lives, but surely as
consumers we do. Buying is the‘ . 
way we push the lever in the eco- ’ ‘
nomic voting booth. Why, we
can choose between elastin anld ’
keritin. _  .-

One thing is clear to the wom-I
an lathering body—bui|ding pro- .'
tein into her scalp. What the
advertisers call brand—loyalty is a
low level consumer protest I
movement. It's our way ofcutting’ - “
through the bouts of decision-‘v 
making, avoiding the barrage of '
useless information. It's a defense  :7
against the need to waste energy’
differentiating between things I .
that barely differ. ‘ 

Could it be that the great
American Consumer_Society has
topped out, subsided, proliferat-V ..
ed into one overwhelming shop— I

ping aisle? Could it be that what ._
the American consumer really _’ 
wants these days is less control?

predictions from Vince "Cincin—
nati over Penn State” Longo or
”We have still another tough
football game coming up against
so and so this week, boys," from
the coaches to dwell on. So you
figure the sportswriters here at
The Pitt News would all be sent
to Aruba or some other exotic
land of Mai Tais for a’ similarly
well-deserved week of relaxation
and/or decadence.

Not the case. Any time these
half—way point breaker—breaker.s
roll around, the first reaction from
the sports desk is to assign the in-
famous "Midseason Analysis” of
a Panther revenue team's goods,
bads and uglies. So, boys and
girls, that is what we will talk
about today —— what has trans-
pired on Cardiac Hill, why, and
what is furthermore expected to
transpire, inspire or even expire.

Defensively, the story can bas-
ically be summed up by the

emergence of a Panther superstar .

Twins

By John Nelson
AP Sports Writer

MINNEAPOLIS — In winning
their first American League pen-
nant in 22 years, it may have
been a loss that counted most
toward success for the Minneso-
ta Twins.

With baseball’s best home
record and one of its worst on the
road, the Twins won the first two
playoff games from the Detroit
Tigers at the Metrodome.

A great boost, said Gary"Gaet-I
ti, the Tw_i ns‘ .t_hi rd b‘aseman. and

Ac

field was a lot tougher than we
had anticipated though.”

”The team was disappointed,”
continued Lear. ”Senior Bob
Wiener and junior Glen ‘Ryan
had bad races. Wiener should
have finished up with [Paul]
Friedrich, and Ryan should have
finished around where Wiener
did. On the other hand, a couple
of the freshmen ran well, which
is a good sign.”

Friedrich, a junior, finished first
for the Panthers and 36th overall.
Waddie Freeman was 43rd over-
all, Wiener finished 69th, and
Ryan was 135th.

The two freshmen who ran

' well at the invitational, improv-

and full-time sack man named
Zeke Gadson. A converted senior
running back, Gadson, with an
incredible I6‘/2 QB takedowns
(including 4‘/2 against Boston
College), is now only 1‘/2 sacks
away from the Panther sack
record held by Randy Holloway.
Oh yeah, and there are still five
games which remain to be
played. '

At that pace, Gadson- would
finish the season with something
like 35 sackeroos, which is un-
heard ofeven by Gastineau stan-
dards of measurement. A little
more on the level of Boston Red
Sox pitcher Roger Clemens’ sin-.
gle game mark of 20 strikeouts.

Freshman defensive lineman
Marc Spindler and former USA
Today's Defensive Player of the
Year has hoisted his hulking
.6-foot—5, 265-pound frame onto
the scene and is definitely mak-
ing his presence known, felt and
painstakingly avoided by other
‘teams. "I’m really impressed by
that Spindler kid,” commented
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz.
"He’s doing such a great job for
such a young player.” .-

lt’s safe to say that Spindler is
the Panthers best freshman play-
er, at any position, since a guy by
the name of Fralic roamed the
Oakland campus.

Of course, DE Burt Grossman
and CB Gary Richard and DTJon
Carter and S Billy Owens and the
rest of the Pitt defense have per-
formed admirably, contributing
to a week—by—week effort that has
kept the Panthers statistically

ing their times, were Craig Wosh-

ner, who finished 80th, and Keith.

Dowling who finished 102nd.

'’I thought our team should
have run faster," said Friedrich.
"The conditions were really bad,
though. It was pouring down
rain. It was a tougher field than
we had expected/"

The Paul Short Invitational was
important to the Panthers as a
warm—up for the Big East Cham-
pionships. It was also a chance to
get familiar with _the course,
which will be the same one that
the Eastern Championships will
be run on.

thinks that G'éToEetown will be
the team to beat at the Big East
Championships on Oct. 24 in
Boston.

"Georgetown, who finished se-
cond at the invitational, will
probably be the strongest team in
the Big East,” said Lear.

/‘We're shooting for third place
this year,” continued Lear. "If we
run well, we could finish third; if
we run badly, we will probably
finish seventh. I know the_ team
does not want to finish seventh,

Women's
tennis
wins 8-1  

By Sam Tallarico

The Pitt women's tennis
team won their second straight
match in hopes of gaining
momentum for this weekend's
Big East,_Tennis Champi-
onship. - - '

The Lady Panthers over-'
whelmed Youngstown State
8-1,thereby raising their'sea-
son record to 7-5. 3

All six singles players won
in straight sets over their oppo-
nents. In fact, of the nine
matches, only one went to
three sets: a doubles match
with Tracy Feltingoff and Bon-

,nie Kartzman, which was the -

7-5, 3-6, 2-6.

’'It was —a great team effort.
Everyone contributed to the
win,” said head coach George
Dieffenbach. "Hopefully"

season.” . _

It may have appeared easy,
but some of the early match
could have made a difference.

”There were some close
matches, particularly the [Bon-
nie] Kartzman, and [Gwen]
Mclntyre matches [Pitt's third-'
and fourth-seeded players _who
won 6-4, 7-5 and 7-6, 6-4
respectively]. As we. shifted 7
momentum, it could have
gone either way. lfthe first two
lose [Tracy Feltingoff and Car-
rie deVera], it would have
changed the outcome,” said
Dieffenbach. .

Although the team is 7-5,
they’ve been riding a good
streak. Since the Bucknell
match early in the season, the
Lady Panthers have won seven
of their last nine matches.

"The team has improved. In
all the years I've coached ten-

team. They are intelligent,

THE PITT News, ‘Wednesday, October 14, I987

Grimes gives experience to soccer team

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

”We have a lot of freshmen on
the team,” said Pitt senior soccer
player Mike Grimes. ”So I'm
looked on to score the goals.”

Grimes was redshirted his
freshman year at Pitt and has
been a consistent starter for the
last four years. He has graduated
with a degree in biology and is
currently studying physical an-
thropology in graduate school.

’’I don't want to get over-my
head with soccer and classwork,
so right now I'm only carrying 10

credits," said Grimes. ”After the
season, I'd like to get into it a lit-
tle more. As of now, I'm just tak-
ing it a little easy.”

In nine games this season,
Mike has scored five goals and
three assists for a total of 13
points — that puts him second on
the team behind fellow senior
Dave Moss. '

”As far as scoring is concerned,
Mike has had to carry a lot on his
shoulders,” said Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher. ”He has done
more than his share of work.”

So far this season, the team
hasn't faired that well in games,

being at the moment 3-5-1. Yet,
Grimes still sees a good nucleus
of people.

”We are a little inexperienced
at the moment, but we'll come
back,” said Grimes. ”We have a
couple of people out due to in-
juries, and our whole back is
new. We'll just have to keep im-
proving.”

Mike attributes a lot of his suc-
cess, as well as the team’s, to
head coach Luxbacher.

”Joe [Luxbacher] expects you
to get better,” said Grimes. ”He
is a disciplinarian but not to the
extreme. He just wants to make

you a better player. He sets a
good example for young players
and demands a lot of respect for
that. He is an excellent coach.”

In a number of games this year,
Grimes has taken the ball at mid-
field, through the defense and
right on goal. All of this with no
help.

”| feel that Mike is one of the
top forwards in the East,” said
Luxbacher. ”He has four years of
experience under his belt and is
a genuine team leader. It's just
too bad that we can't get the play-
ers to compliment him.”

Although the team is under

.500 at the moment, there is still
a lot of time toturn the season
around.

”The rest of the teams on the
schedule are just about on our
level — with the exception of
Robert Morris, who is really
stacked,” said Grimes. ”We
could very definitely turn it
around. We'll probably make
some changes this week, and
hopefully they will work."

Grimes and his teammates face .

Big East rival Georgetown this
Saturday afternoon at Pitt Stadi-
um. Game time is 1:30 p.m.

Three more Steelers cross the picket line

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Defen-
sive lineman Gerald Williams,
saying ’’I had to consider my fa-
mily's welfare before my team-
mates’ welfare," joined two other
players Tuesday in defecting to
the Pittsburgh Steelers’ replace-
ment team.

Merril Hoge, a rookie running

back, and first-year offensive tack-
le Jerry Quick also reported to a

‘morning team meeting, bringing

to seven the number of Steelers
who have broken ranks with their
striking teammates.

The Steelers who previously
returned were center Mike Web-
ster and running backs Earnest

Jackson, Frank Pollard and
Dwight Stone. Webster and Jack-
son have played in both of the
Steelers’ replacement games.
Williams, a part-time player,

was a 1986 second-round draft _

choice and was credited with
four tackles and one assist in the
Steelers’ two prestrike games. He

returned for financial reasons.

”It’s not that I have any large
financial debts, it's just that I have
a kid on the way and I'm build-
ing a house,” Williams said. ’’I
have to look out for my family's
best interests.” E

7 Williams, _, a 6-foot-3,
270-pound defensive end and
tackle from Auburn, said his wife,
Susie, is two months pregnant. ”I
know in my mind and heart I did
what was best,” he said.

’’It really wasn't that easy. I still
feel bad about it, but in another
sense I don't feel ‘bad at all," he
said. ’’I considered coming in last
week, but I thought about my
teammates and that kept me out
for a week.”

Williams did not attend a Tues-
day meeting of the striking Steel-
called ‘ by player
representative Tunch’“Ilki'n be-
cause ”it would have been use-

less ..; I had made my decision.”

Hoge,, a lOth—round draft
choice from Idaho State, didn't

win a spot on the Steelers’
45-man regular season roster un-
til the final cutdown. Quick, a
free agent tackle from Wichita
State, began the season on in-
jured reserve and was activated
just four days before the strike be-
gan Sept. 22.

’’I don't feel great about this,”
Quick said. ”Walking away from
your teammates is like messing
up your best friend.  But I just
don't have the resources to sit out
any longer. I was a free agent and
I feel fortunate to be part of this
team.

”Financially, it was becoming
a pretty expensive vacation.  I
just don't have the resources to

' sit out any longer. I don't have

the job security, either,” he said.

Steelers Coach Chuck Noll has.
warned striking players they are
in danger of losing their jobs to’
the replacements once the strike__

ends, especially if they report out
of shape. '

what's goin’ on here? The fans
wondered. A

Still, the trend Continued. The
offense generated only ten points
in a losing effort against Boston

College, a team that Penn State 

racked up 27 on just the week
before.

Public outcry demanded quar-
terback Sal Genilla have a per-
sonal meeting with an American
made guillotine, for the senior
was, and maybe still is, having
some‘ trouble with a Concept
known as the forward pass.

, His interception to touchdown
ratio was 8-6, and the Union of

either rookie Darnell Dickerson
or rookie Larry Wanke. behind
Center in an attempt to get things

going. . ,

Of Course, this past weekend's

win over the Fighting Irish has

somehow changed all of that, for .

it was Pitt's biggest win since
whipping Penn State 31-.11'in

‘N Tuesday.

’’If I ever had a football team

L - that was suited to play indoors

and on artificial surfaces, this is

much speed,” Paterno said at his
weekly press conference.

FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) —

sional success after 2‘/2 rough
years on the road, returned to his
roots and rooters on Tuesday
when the New England Patriots

obtained him from the Chicago

tor that you have to make sure
you're prepared for,” Paterno
said. ”We’ll try to simulate some
noise situations. We've played
there before, and the noise hasn't
really bothered us.” .\

Penn State is 3-0 at the Carrier
Dome since it opened in 1980,
winning 24-20 in the Nittany
Lions’ last appearance there, in
1985.

Each of Penn State's appear-
ances has drawn more than
50,000, ranking in the top six box
office draws in the dome’s
history.

This weekend's game, which
will be televised nationally by
CBS, has been sold out for three

Bears.

. Fans who cheered the Heisman I

Trophy—wi_nning quarterback at
Boston College may welcome
him back, but there is no guaran-
tee his path will be smooth.
Flutie intends to cross the pick-
et line during the NFL strike and,

weeks, according to Mark Bick-
el, a Syracuse sports spokesman.

The sellout is the first at the
Carrier Dome since Penn State's
last visit, he said. T

’’I think our kids will enjoy the
crowd,”,Paterno said. ”The ex-
citement of the crowd, regardless
of whom they might be cheering
for, really gets the adrenaline go-
ing for both teams, so I don't
think that's going to be a factor
in any way.” __,,e

Paterno will prepare his team
for crowd noise by setting up
loudspeakers during a scrim-
mage, said Pete Kowalski, Penn
State's assistant sports informa-
tion director.

Once the strike is over, Flutie
will have to squeeze into an al-
ready crowded Patriots quarter-
back corps. '

None of those potential
problems were enough to shatter
Flutie’s dream of coming back
home. That became ’a reality
when the Bears traded him for an
undisclosed draft choice.

~-TH-E-PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 14, 1987

In Penn State's first visit to the
Carrier Dome, in 1981, Curt
Warner ran for a school record

256 yards during Penn State's’

41-16 victory. Penn State won its
second game there 17-6.

Syracuse has a 25-17 record at
the Carrier Dome, while compil-
ing a 10-24-1 mark on the road
during the period.

This year, Penn State, 5-1,

”Sometimes, some people may

on three carries against the
Orangemen, including a 92-yard
sweep.

’’I don't think they were quite
