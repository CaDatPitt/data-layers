In search of a provost .

For The Pitt News

More than 150 candidates applied or I

have been nominated to be Pitt’s new
provost so far, and the Provost Search

Committeewill have the difficult task

of ﬁnding someone to meet the needs
of thevarious departments, graduate

I schools and branch campuses.

The Provostsearch Comrnitteeas-
sembled last Friday to discuss ﬁnding
areplacementfor currentProvostand
Senior Vice Chancellorjames Maher,
who armounced his retirement plans
in November. The committee, led by

' ViceChancellorforResearchConduct"

and Compliance Randy-Juhl, met in
2700 Posvar Hall, and invitedstudents
and faculty to voice the qualiﬁes they
would like Maher’s successor to have.
Representatives from each ofPitt’s four
regional campuses attended byvideo-
conferencing. _

“We need a good person  Some-

one who’s demanding but fair,” Juhl. ‘

said.

Many University leaders ﬁ‘omPitt’s '_
main and regional campuses agreed-

that itwill be difficult to ﬁnd a replace-

. ment who can live up to the standards

of Maher, who served as provost for
the past 15 years. Some expressed
apprehension about the transition of
power. 1 A I .

more candidates to applybythe end of

EDITORIAL

Texas school books altered by politics, poor structure

lived up to its reputation
as the Lone Star State when
the State Board of Education

approved a newly amended social

studies curriculum Friday. _
After three days of meetings, the

Board succeeded in creating a more‘

conservative perspective for history
education, and the textbooks usedin *

its public schools will directly reﬂect
these new changes.

There is more to gain from this
change in Texas’ educational system
than a mere affirming gauge of the
state’s stereotypically Republican.
political demographic -— these con-
servative amendments speak to the
awesome power of education regu-
lation.

For the next 10 years, Texan stu-
dents from kindergaitento 12th grade
will learn about the Black Panthers to
provide some balance when learning
about Dr. Martin Luther Kingjr.

They will miss out on learning
about historical Hispanic ﬁgures
and will pass on Thomas Jefferson
and the Enlightenment for some
Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin,
according to The New York Times.
These students comprise an entire
generation of people that will inﬂu-
ence its immediate society. ,

“[They] are adding balance,” to
left-skewedAca‘demia, Dr. Don McLe-
roy, the leader of the conservative fac-
tion on the Board, said in the Times
article.

The Board is rewriting history in
a sense, rewriting the history that
many Americans have already ac-
cepted as the standard. It is incredible
how much sway politically oriented
people can have in something as or-
ganic as education.

What is powerﬁil about this move
is the deviation from the standard.

V A board of education has incred-

ible inﬂuence, for better or worse.
It begs the pondering of exactly how

such a boardshould be composed

and rim. .

Public education has always suf-
fered from a conﬂict of interests be-
tween whatis culuirally pertinent and
what is considered to be historically
factual. These do not always separate

cleanly, giving written history some
bias. Separation of church and state
seems almost ironic for the buckle of
the Bible Belt.

Residents of Texas elected these
Board members to represent them. If
the result is to their liking, then the
system worked. But if Texans were
shocked, they will be careﬁil voting
next time and might reconsider the
Board.

So this is notaquestion of political
views but a question of the structure
of state educational systems. The
nation canlearn whether or not the
current systems are the best ﬁomthis
education review.

Besides questioning the mechan-
ics of representation of the Board,

one should question exactly who is on
it. For example, Gail Lowe (R), chair
of the Texas State Board ofEducation,
has volunteered teaching elementary
students. Besides that, according to
the Board’s website, she has no other
teaching experience. Teachers would
be the most ideal candidates to chair
for an education board, though to
their credit, other board members
have been educators in the past.
The strength a few elected mem-
bers can have ina small—bodied board
is something for Texans —- and all
Americans for that matter — to con-
siderwhen next electing their boards.
It seems the Texas State Board of Edu-

cation review of2o10willbe enlight--

ening all the same.

Same ‘Alice, ’ different ‘Wonderland’

A 8' E Editor

“Alice in Wonderland”
Starr-ingtjohnny Depp, MiaWasikows—
ka, Helena Bonham Carter

Director: Tim Burton

Walt Disney Pictures ’

Grade: B-

Goi_ng into the Tim Burton’s highly
anticipated ﬁlm adaptation of Lewis
Carroll’s perennial classic, I was hop-
ingto delvé into aworld where, as the
Cheshire Cat assures Alice, everyone
is mad.

Whatl got, however, was a visual
feast that, while providing a solid
hour—and-a—half of entertainment,
only illustrated Burton skating on the
madness that “Alice in Wonderland”
lends itself to, but never really diving
into and embracing theiabsurdity of
the material ‘ - j

The ﬁlmbegins vvithAliceas anow—
grownyoungwoman, sulfocatingunder

the constraints of rigid Victorian life. .

While Alice is at a stuﬂy engagement
party — her own — the White Rabbit
shows up, and theﬁlmquickly plunges
downthe rabbitholewithAlice, literally
and metaphorically.

- Upon entering Underland, Alice

onlyinthevague sense ofthedream. It
doesn’treallymake much sense —‘nor
does the fact the creatures continually
refer to her as the “wrong Alice.” Is it
a symptom of the creature’s madness
thatthey can’t recognize her?Is ittheir
memory so short—terrn that they can’t
recognize that iconic blond hair, blue
dress and blithely naive expression?

Leave it to the Mad Hatter to rec-
ognize Aliceasthe destined champion
ofwonderland, or Underland, to take
downthetyrannicalRedQueenand her
Jabberwock. Oh, and the battle has to
take place on Frabjous Day, seemingly
for the sole purpose ofjohnny Depp
being able to dance a jig.

Stripping the plot and aura of “Al-
ice in Wonderland” of its magical Car-
roll touch is to do an injustice to the
material, as one of the work’s primary
reasons for existence is to serve as a
surreal and ingeniously constructed
escape from  ' e

Tim Burton succeeds in doing
the material justice to an extent The
creatures are wonderfully weird, the
landscapes are intriguing and he gives
the ﬁlm a subtle gray ﬁlter, giving oﬂ?
the appearance of a Wonderland that
has had an atom bomb dropped on it
But there are scenes, especially those

to wonder how much further Burton
could have taken the more fantastical
elements of such afantastic story. '
Theﬁlmpicks and chooses among
various elements from both “Alice in

. Wonderlan ” and its sequel, “Through

the Looking-Glass,” and while every-
thing meshes nicely, something feels
strangely offby the time the ﬁnal Nar-
nia—esque battle comes around.

I can’t express my concern more
clearlythanthis quotefromEntertain—
mentweekly critic Owen Gleiberman’s
review of the ﬁln1: “The challenge of
adapting Alice in Wonderland is this:

How do you create relationships, a _

story, a purpose out of a tale whose
prime purpose is not to have one?
Though the sum of the movie’s
parts is ofllputiing and alittle disap-
pointing, it doesn’t detract from the
wonderlirl aspects of the ﬁlm. Depp’s

performanceisexpectedly, delightfully ‘

weird, and Bonharn Carter prevents

V task, indeed.

Theﬁlm’s 3-D effects areusedmuch
in the same vein as “Avatar” — there
are no places in the ﬁlmthat appear
to use 3-D as a gimmick, but rather, it
merely serves to provide a depth and
realism to a setting that should look

Oscars a dragging race to acting

Andy Tybout
Columnist

I’ll give this to the 2010 Oscar hype:

when the right people win, it makes the

victory that much sweeter — almost
sweet enough, in fact, to forget you’ve

just wasted three and a halfhours of
your life on a mostly pointless awards

ceremony.

Once again, the Academy Awards
strived to be morethananawards cer-
emony —— it was a struggle of block-
busters against independents, popu-
lar versus critical taste, money Versus
art. And in almost every category, it
seemedthe lattertrumped theformerg
thanks largely to “The Hurt Locker,”
the lowest-grossing Best Picture award
winner of time, which mopped the
ﬂoor with its six awards.

In fact, despite my deeply en-
trenched Oscarcynicisrn,asurprising
number of Oscars were given to those
who, in my opinion, actually deserved
them.]efl' Bridges did a marvelous job
in “Crazy Heart.” Christoph Waltz —

whowonforhissupportingrolein“In— '

glorious Basterds” — was a badass of
the highest order. And ifthere’s ever a
supporting role that begs reward, it’s
Mo’Nique’s stunning perforrnanée in
“Precious.”

Of course, awards showswillnever
completely align with our personal

tastes. For my part, I was pulling for

“Inglourious Basterds” _or ‘_‘Up in the
Air” to win Best Picture. And the fact
that “The Hurt Locker,” while un-
doubtedlyaﬁneﬁlm,beat“Inglourious

~ Basterds”forBestOriginalScreenplay
irked me abit But, at leastfor now, the-

tastes of the Academy seem to have
improved. '

Unfortunately, the more crippling
problem of the Oscars remains: it’s
still very long and very boring. Bythe
time they ﬁnally got around to the cat-
egories ofBestActor and Actress after
approximately three hours ofbabble,~I
resembled afreshman at afrat party:
nearlypassed out onacouch,justwant-
ing it all to end.

So while the standards ofthe Acad-

emy rnight appear to have risen, the I

Oscarswillprobably remainabloated,
irrelevant endeavor. Kind of like the
Grarnrnys. Or any other awards cer-
emony, for that matter. The question,
though, iswhetherit’s even possiblefor
these ceremonies to be otherwise.
Iused to thinkso. My ideal awards
show would clock in at less than one

awards, Best Picture

hour. It would be hosted by someone
who had zero tolerance for bullsh*t

—VingRhames, maybe, ormyforrner A '

cross country coach. And if an award
were ever given unjustly, Kanye would
leap to the stage duringthe acceptance

' speech and informthe audiencewhom

the real_winner should be.
Gone, too, wouldbethe Academy’s

taste in music — Randy Newman al— '

ready has enough awards. In its place

would be “Best Use of Swear Words” -
or “Best Song That is Actually Kind"

of Catchy.” .
Absurdity aside,Ihad apretty spe-

ciﬁc image of a good awards show. And I
' I’m sure many of mypeers arethe same
way. But the problem is that all of our .

ideas are distinctly different From the
length of the ceremony to who should
get what award, we lack a collective

 ..,...,.... .......--..... . ,..

opinion on what “quality” is.

So it’s not just the Oscars that is
bullsh*t. It’s everyone who seeks to
rank one piece of art above another,
to constructa supposedly infallible hi-
erarchy. It’s like Hamlet said: “there is
nothing either good orbad, buttl1ink-
ing makes it so.”

Faced with this truth, we can do
one oftwothingszwecanscornforever
any and all awards ceremonies (per-
sonally, Ithinkwe could all do without

I, the Grammys), or we can enjoy these ‘

ceremonies with a grain of salt Yes,
the judges rarely pickwhat-we believe
to be the right choice. Yes, “The Blind
Side” shouldrft even have been'norni—
nated. But who cares‘? The Oscars are
still (sometimes) ‘entertaining.

Still, would it kill to have,Ving
Rharnes host a ceremony or two?

Wild, wild west: Pitt lands aNo. 3_seed

Panthers placed third in the West Region, will take on Oakland on Friday

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬂ” Writer

The is ﬁnally over. The selection

' committee announced the ﬁeld of 65
V last night with Pitt getting a No. 3

seed in the West Region to advance
to_ its ninth straight NCAA Tourna-
ment. ‘

Its bracket is highlighted by No.
1 seed Syracuse, along with'second-

seeded Kansas State and strong

mid-maj or teams such as Butler and
Gonzaga.
But up ﬁrst for the Panthers as

-they travel tolMi1waukee are the No.

14 seed Oakland Golden Grizzlies, the
champions of the Summit League.
They come into this game riding an
11-game winning streak.

The two teams share one common
opponent in'Syracuse, who Oakland
lost to 92-60 in December. But Pitt
won’t be overlooking any opponents

_ in this Tournament, especially not-

after last year when the team nar~
rowly avoided being upsetinthe ﬁrst
round by East Tennessee State + a
No. 16 seed.’ j .

“You can’t take any game lightly,
and that’s ‘something we learned
especially from the ﬁrst game [last
year] ,” sophomore guard Ashton

Gibbs said.

Oakland is led by its 6-foot-11 cen-
ter Keith Benson, who averages 17
points and 10.5 rebounds per game.

While the Panthers don’t know much a

about theirﬁrst—round opponent yet,
they knowthat they will need to stop
a Benson down low.‘

“I know they got a real big guy,
and he’s pretty good in the post,”
redshirt freshman guard Travon
Woodall said. .-

The Golden Grizzlies are also led
by guard Johnathon Jones and for-
ward Derick Nelson, who each aver-
age 12.4 points per game to give their

A teamseveral scoring options.
' “They’re a versatile team, have
pretty good size and come from a
- pretty decent league,” Gibbs said. “So
now it’s just about not’ taking them
lightly and acting like we’re playing
' against a Big East team.”
- The Panthers’ last game against
a Big East team didn’t go so well, as
they lost 50-45 to Notre Dame in
the quarterﬁnals of the conference
tournament. They struggled to get
in a rhythm on offense and hope to
rectify that with a week off before
they play again on Friday.

“It’s just about execution, and
that’s defensively and offensively,”
Gibbs said. “We have to execute de-

fensively more and more and if we do
that the offensive ﬂow will be much
better.” 4'
While the Panthers ﬁnally earned
some respect by gettinga No. 3 seed
in a season when not many people
gave them respect and were picked

. to ﬁnish ninth in the Big East, they

have all the motivation they need in
this postseason. ' ‘
“I’m motivated because we lost
_our last game,” Gibbs said. “Now it’s
just about executing in practice and
carrying it over to the game.”
If they are able to win their ﬁrst-

" round game, the Panthers will face

the winner of the matchup between
No. 6 seed Xavier and No. 11 seed
Minnesota on Sunday. Xavier is no
stranger to Pitt, as they met last year
in the Sweet Sixteen with the Pan-
thers winning 60-55.

Pittis one of only seven teams to
have advanced to the last nine NCAA
Tournaments. But it hasn’t been able

to make it to the Final Four any of ‘

those years. If the team were'to make
it there this season, it would have
to go through Salt Lake City in the
regional ﬁnals

But Pitt isn’t resting on its laurels
or looking aheadasitwill direct allof

its attention towards Oakland in the '

next few days.

Defense wins championships. It has
been said a, million times, but the in-
tegral piece of a championship te
is adefense. ~
The Pitt men’s -basketball team
displays one of the premier defenses
in the nation and has been the key to
the team’s success all year.
The Panthers, however, simply
don’t have the scoring capabilities to

" ‘é6iﬁpEinéiit‘tiiéir‘défensiveprowess; “ "

whichwillultimately leave them short
of a title this year.
But, the Panthers’ superb defense

will carry them to at least another

Sweet Sixteen appearance.

Solid defenseis the trademark ‘

for ajamie Dixon-coached Pitt team
over his seven seasons leading the
Panthers.

The Pitt defense ranked second in

l the BigEastthis season, givingup only '

65.9 points per contest. Panthers guard
Jermaine Dixon is widely considered
one of the best shutdown defenders in
the nation, while junior forward Gary
McGhee has established himselfas a
defensive force on the low post‘.

‘ The Panthers heldexplosive of-
fenses like Syracuse, Villanova, Mar-
quette and Providence to well below
their season scoring averages.

Scoring, however, remains a con-

Pitt has what it takes to win , first two games

cern for the Panthers, especially after
a season—low 45-point output against
Notre Dame in the Big  tourna-
ment.

The Panthers have been able to
make up for their lack of offensive
ﬁrepower by making teams defend
long offensive possessions and not
letting teams open up the ﬂoor.

Another reason Pitt is equipped
to make an appearance in the Sweet
Sixteen is the team’s success in close
games this season.

Pitt a much younger team than a year ago

The Panthers boast only one returning starter from the NCAA Tournament team last season

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

When Levance Fields, Sam Young, DeJuan
Blair and Tyrell Biggs departed Pitt last sum-
mer, they took with them 11 NCAA Tourna-
ment games combined throughout their
careers and appearances in four Big East
tournaments that included one champion-
ship. The foursome took a bundle of experi-
ence, oh-so-valuable experience — the kind
that wins you games and brings postseason
success.

This year, with four starters from last
season graduated or NBA-employed, only
Jermaine Dixon came into the season with

a considerable amount of experience as a-
starter — to date, ‘he’s started 57 career ,

gaines, including every game from a year ago
alongside the aforementioned foursome.

Prior to this 2009-2010 campaign, Gil-
bert Brown and Gary McGhee were the only
players‘ aside from Dixon to have started a
game for the Panthers. Brown started 15
games in 2007-2008 and McGhee one game
in place of Blair last year. ‘

Experience was short entering the sea-
son. But the Panthers —- who were mediocre
early, great at times and ultimately exceeded
everyone’s expectations this season —— have
emerged from postseason play feeling like
they now have the experience needed to
compete and be successful come tourna-
ment time. Some of that conﬁdence stems
from the residual effects of what the team’s
departed stars instilled in the rest of the
squad.‘ ’

“Those guys are always focused going
into a game,” Brad Wanamaker, who’s started

every game this season, said last Monday. ,

“Just watching them, you pick up a lot of
things.” '

"Players like McGhee, who was on the
roster when Pitt won the Big East tourna-
ment crown two seasons ago despite limited
playing time as a freshman, knows what it’s
like to be on a team that made a serious run
when most people expected less. It was a
similar experience this year, when Pitt was
picked to ﬁnish in the bottom half "of the
conference in preseason because of their
youth and supposed inexperience.

“We just tell them that some people had us
out that season not making the tournamen ,”
McGhee said. “That season we just made a
run. We all came together as a team.”

Then there’s Dixon. Throughout the sea-
son, Head Coach Jamie Dixon has identi-
ﬁedjermaine as the team’s most prominent
leader. He is the Panther’s sole signiﬁcant
senior player and, alongside Brown, one of
the only players on this year’s squad who
had important standing on last year’s NCAA
Tournament depth chart.

“Our guys believe in Jermaine Dixon,”

Head Coach Jamie Dixon said Feb. 21 after
the Panthers defeated Villanova 70-65. “He
gives us conﬁdence, and he’s our toughest
guy. This is his team.”

Last week, the Panthers missed the op-
portunity for the current roster to gain
valuable postseason experience when they

‘ bowed out of the Big East tournament in

New York to Notre Dame. Though Pitt had
a double-bye as a result of ﬁnishing second

APPREClA'l1DN
OF THE ARTS

in the league during the regular season, it
fell to Notre Dame for the second time in its
last ﬁve games.

That leaves starters Ashton Gibbs, Brad
Wanamaker, Gary McGhee and Nasir Robin-
son a combined total of four games started
in postseason play in addition to Dixon —— a
far cry from the experience of last year’s
starting outﬁt.

‘ But for all the supposed immaturity, Ja-

 

mie Dixon has seen his program as readily
growing throughout the year and will try to
put a positive spin on the early Big East exit
heading into the NCAA Tournament.

“They’ve been called young, inexperi-
enced all year, but they haven’t played like
it,” Dixon said after Pitt’s loss to Notre Dame
Friday. “I think this will be a good learning
lesson for us today. I think this is something
we can get better for.”

Senior Staff Writer

K When the Pittsburgh Panthers entered the

2001-02 season, nobody expected them
to ﬁnish like they did. '
A year after making a run to the Big

'East tournament championship game

and playing in the National Invitational
Tournament, the Pitt men’s basketball
team was picked as a middle-of—the—pack
Big East squad. C

But by the end of the season, the Pan-
thers were the Big East regular-season
champions. They advanced to the Big East
tournament championship game for the
second straight year and made a trip to
NCAA Sweet Sixteen as a No. 3 seed. Y

Brandin Knight, now an assistant coach
for Pitt, was the team’s star junior point

guard. He was named~Big East Co—Player .
. of the Year and‘Big East Most Improved

Player at the end of the season. Then-

’ Head Coach Ben Howland was the Big East .

Coach of the Year.

Sweet Sixteen. P,

become the head coach at UCLA. The team
lost an All—American in Knight, as well as
seniors Donatas Zavackas and Ontario

despite losses

the Panthers to another Big East Confer-
ence regular seasontitle, a third straight
appearance. in the Big East tournament
championship game and a third consecu-
tive Sweet Sixteen.

Dixon, in his first year as head coach,
was named Big East Coach of the Year
following that season.

Since that year, the Panthers have
played in five NCAA tournaments and
three Big East tournament championship
games, with one more title. They added a
Sweet Sixteen appearance in 20055-07 and
advanced to the Elite Eight last season.

Entering this season, the Panthers have
the highest winning percentage of any
Big East team (.797). Pitt is also the third
winningest program in the country over
that time period, trailing only Kansas and
Duke. -/ s T

The Panthers progressed from a good
team in 2001-02, to one of the most con‘-
sistent programs in the country over the
past eight years. .

They’ve done it without the highest-
ranked players. Often, with the notable
exception of last season, they’ve done it
without national superstars.

In fact, ‘freshman Dante Taylor is Pitt’s~
first—ever McDonald’s All-American. De-
Juan Blair was Pitt’s first AP First Team
All-American since 1958. , .

But there’s linkage with the Pitt pro-

gram: When one player graduates, another ’

is ready to take his place. The point guard

position was handed down from Knight to

’ Krauser to Levance Fields to, Ashton Gibbs.

At center, Chris Taft, Aaron Gray, Blair and
Gary McGhee followed Lett. s

Pitt grooms players While they wait their turn

Knight (2002), Krauser (2004), Gray
(2006), Sam Young (2008) and Gibbs
(2010).

The Panthers groom their players while
they are waiting in the wings. What is a
breakout season for the rest of the coun-

try is only expected from Pitt’s players.

and coaches.
Prior to this season, Head Coachjamie

' Dixon said, “This team can be as good as

any team we’ve had. No one thinks it out-
side here. I know what everyone is writing.
But we don’t play the games on paper, we
play them on the court.” '

At the time, nobody really believed
him. After all, the Panthers lost four start-
ers from the team that went 31-5 and ad-
vanced to the Elite Eight. But on the court,
Pitt barely missed a beat }——- the Panthers
simply continued the success they started
eight years ago.

Picked to ﬁnish ninth in the 16—team
conference, Pitt ﬁnished second. Many
experts predicted Pitt would play in the
NIT this season, but the Panthers received
their ninth—straight NCAA tournament
bid on Sunday — the longest streak in
the Big East. '

The Panthers reinvented themselves,
transforming from the high-scoring, star-
laden team from last year into a squad
focused more on performing on the de-
fensive end -— it’s a ﬂashback to the Pitt
teams of the early 2000s.

The coaches know how to get the Pan-

thersto play to their strengths.
, “We’ve always had guys elevating their
games and surprising peop1e,”jamie Dixon
said before the start of this season. “I an-
ticipate that happening again, although I
don’t know who it will be. I’m sure it will
be a couple guys. They are ready for that
opportunity.”

Dixon was right. This season, it was
Gibbs, Brad Wanamaker and McGhee
who notably rose to the challenge for the
Panthers.

Gibbs led the team with 16.2 points

per game after averaging 4.3 points last.
season. Wanamaker improved his scoring -

average from 5.8 to 11.1 points per game.
Early in the season, Gibbs and Wanamaker
often carried the full weight of Pitt’s of-
fense.

McGhee stepped in to fill the center
position vacated by Blair. He went from
averaging 6.7 minutes, 1.2 points and 1.5
rebounds last season to contributing 7
points and 6.9 rebounds in 23.2 minutes
a game. ' '

After the Panthers defeated Lousiville _

in overtime earlier this season, senior

Jermaine Dixon reminded outsiders that
to Pitt, the success wasn’t a surprise. There
are players in the program who competed

V every day against the players- from last

year.
Pitt isn’t just a team. It’s a program.
“When a lot of people were counting us
out, we knew we were ready to play and
that we could play with any team in the
-country,” Jermaine Dixon said then. “We
work hard in and out of practice and we
have an unbelievable chemistry.”

In the past two years, the Big East Conference
has been a dominant force in the NCAA Tourna-
ment.

This year could prove no different.

Itwill be toughto top lastyear’s BigEast,which
sported eightteams inthe Tournament. Of those,
three earned No. 1 seeds, ﬁve were in the Sweet
Sixteen and two made it to the Final Four.

But it’s a new year with a new crdp of Big East

. squads, with expectations of each varying from

national championship contenders to just happy
tobe inthe ﬁeld of 65.

While the Panthers are vying for a national
championship, here’s what the other Big East
teams’ hopes are for this postseason.

right atthe opportune time.

Lest we forget, Notre Dame severely under-
achieved throughout the entire season. The Irish
have a chance, as they do bring Luke Harangody,
the Big East’s leading scorer,'off the bench. But
the question I have is this — IfNotre Dame ﬁnds

and ditch the new style for their old style of push-

Calhoun: show me a good reason for expandin

Expansion 4 20

Consider Villanova Head Coach Jay
Wright’s plea. Wright has gone on record
in the past as a supporter of expanding

the NCAA Tournament ﬁeld. Last month, _

he spoke those same words citing that
the game has grown beyond the limits of
a 65-team tournament. ’

“When I ﬁrst became a Division I head V
coach I think there were 297 teams. Now _
there’s 347. The Tournament has stayed
the same size,” Wright said in a confer-
ence call. “The game has grown, all of the
conferences have grown, the mid—major
programs have grown. There’s, just so many
more good teams out there.”

He also said there are teams out there
who think their seasons are failures only

if they miss the NCAA Tournament. In this ‘

case, they could have had a great season
despite it. .

“It’s still a greathonor to make the
Tournament even if they increase it to 96.
You can look at college football, maybe 50
percent get to go to bowl games,” Wright
said, “But I think [tournament expansion]
is past its time, and I’m really excited that —
we’re considering it.”

The NCAA Tournament has been altered

_just once since 1985, when it expanded

from 53 to 65 teams. Coincidentally, Vil-

‘ lanova won its first national title in 1985

in the expanded tournament.

The widely reported proposal from
the NCAA is expanding the teams in the
tournament from 65 to 96. The NCAA is
in the eighth year of an 11-year $6 billion
contract with‘CBS for the rights to March
Madness. The deal accounts for more than
90 percent of the organization’s.annual
revenue. '

The NCAA could opt out of its CBS deal 5

for an even more lucrative contract thanks
to a clause that allows the NCAA to opt out
of the ﬁnal three years, with noobligation
to CBS, if it does so byjuly 31. Upon doing
so, the NCAA is an unrestricted free agent
to the bidding of television networks in
the United States. , ‘

In‘ potentially expanding the ‘NCAA
Tournament, the NCAA is making itself

look more proﬁtable and attractive to net-
works. Especially since last year’s North
Caro1ina—Michigan State championship
game drew the lowest Nielsen rating since
the game viewership has been tracked.

There are others who are a little more
skeptical. ‘-

Connecticut Head Coach Jim Calhoun
seemed to waver on the idea of expanding
the amount of revenue generated from the
NCAA’s postseason tournament.

“I’m opposed to [expansion] in the
sense that it will make 99 percent of the
money,” Calhoun said in a conference call.
“I’ve always thought it was an honor and
privilege to.be one of those 65 teams, and
I do think the increase, if it’s better for the
game and someone can show me why it is,
then I would say yes. If it’s just to make
additional money, then I’d say no.”

Yet Calhoun is a rare breed of dissenters
among coaches.

Expansion 4 21

MCT Campus

Connecticut Huskies Head Coach Jim Calhoun isn’t a fan of expanding the Tournament.

‘Many more high-profile head coaches,-

such as Michigan State’s Tom Izzo and Flor-
ida’s Billy Donovan, continue to support
expansion publicly. Others, such as Pitt’s
Jamie Dixon, have questioned to the media
how the Tournament would be feasible.

“He didn’t understand how they would

go about seeding the teams, and more

importantly he wondered well, you’re al-
ready playing until the first week in April
now, you’ll be adding an extra weekend,”

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter Ray Fit-
tipaldo said. '

Fittipaldo, who covers Pitt basket-

ball for the-Post-Gazette, also added he
wouldn’t see how Pitt would beneﬁt from

such an expansion unless it received funds

from a new TV contract.

Healso added the Tournament should
avoid byes, because’-based on three Big
East squads losing in their first games
of double—byes in the Big East tourna-

ment last week, extra days of rest aren’t
a beneﬁt. r

But the prospect of expansion has
caught the eyes of all Big Eastcoaches,
with more ‘supporters emerging than
doubters. ’ '

“I would like to see the Tournament
expanded,” Georgetown Head Coachjohn
Thompson III said. in a conference call,
who added that he never thought about
how many teams should be invited or how

an expanded tournament would be con- 

structed. “At the end of the day, I would
like to see it opened up and see more teams
get a chance to compete.” l
The NCAA still faces a ton of questions
about its Tournament expansion proposal.
But we’re already seeing Big East coaches

« take sides. In the coming months, this is-

sue should resurface, and more and more
coaches will give their opinions on the
expansion idea.

Panthers will need to find

consistency in Tournament  

Offense will need to rebound after Big East tournament loss

  

Sports Editor

 YORK — It was just what the Pan-
ithers wanted. _

 4 They, held Notre Dame to 50 points.
§They out—rebounded the Fighting Irish
fby ﬁve, 27-22. They stayed out of.foul
;trouble and got 16 points from Brad Wa-
gnamaker. A 3 I ,
 7 But it wasn’t what the Panthers needed
‘to beat the seventh-seeded Irish in their
_3Big.East tournament quarterﬁnals match-

up.':Notre Dame handediPitt, coming off a 

double-bye, a 50-45 opening round loss
ion Thursday.
As has been the case throughoutthe

lfseason, Pitt shot inconsistently against v

lNotreVDame. At halftime, the Panthers
were 45.8 percent from the field on 11-
of-24 shooting and trailed the Irish by
three, 32-29. 1

By -the end of the game, that number
‘got worse. The Panthers missed 14 of their
20 ﬁeld goal attempts — many in a late-

_'minute and last-second push to send the

game to overtime -—— and didn’t make any
of their three three-point shots. Their ﬁeld
goal percentage dropped to 38.6 forthe
game and, aside from Wanamaker, only
Jermaine Dixon reached double-digits
with 10 points. 8
Ashton Gibbs, the team’s top point-
getter, played a strong game, but the Notre
Dame defense didn’t give him many op-
portunities to shoot. He ﬁnished the game
(with four points and missed his only three-
point attempt. _ '
“At the end of the day,” Head Coach
Jamie Dixon said after the game, “we just
got to shoot better. We’ve got to play bet-
‘:t‘.'>eI..:: ‘ .
M The loss to Notre Dame in the Big East
‘tournament wasn’t the first time Pitt
struggled offensively. In a nonconference

Jay Huerbin .

matchup against New Hampshire in De-
cember, the two teams set a Division I re-
cord in combining for just 22 points in the
ﬁrst half as Pitt led 15-7 at the break.

Against Notre Dame in a regular season
matchup, Pitt shot 41.8 percent from the
field and was only 4—of-18 from the arc
in the 68-53 loss. Even in their upset win
over Villanova on Feb. 21, the Panthers
ﬁeld goal percentage was 35.1.

But the Panthers have-been on the up-
side as well. Against Marquette, the Pan-
thers shot 54.8 percent from the ﬁeld, and
four of their five starters scored 10 points‘.
Gibbs was the lone man out, scoring only
twopoints off free throws. I _ _ ~ 

' The inconsistency on offense has often
led to a strong defensive perfo'rrnance.

3 Struggling to ﬁnd the basket against N otre

Dame on Thursday, the Panthers still held
the Irish to 50 points in a low—possession
game. And when then-unranked Pitt upset
then—No. 5 Syracuse at the Carrier Dome
onjan. 2, the Panthers held the Orange to
a 7.7 three—point shooting percentage.

The Panthers have played ‘in close ' ‘L
games throughout the season, like the

three—overtime win over West Virginia or
Gibbs’ last-second three-pointer to beat
Rutgers, and the margin for inconsistency
on the offensive side gets smaller as the
season comes to a close.

As the Panthers get ready fr.their
Tournament ﬁrst—round matchup on Fri-
day, ﬁnding the right balance between

offense and defense will be the key if they '

hope to make a repeat appearance to the
Elite Eight. _ .

For Dixon, the inconsistency might
come with a young team, but one that
is ready to fix problems from the Notre
Dame game.

“They’ve been called young, inexpe-
rienced all year, but they haven’t played
like it,” Dixon said. “I think this will be a
good learning lesson for us ... I think this
is something we can get better for.”

25-

More upsets this season

Tournament 4 24

4 opponents have played at least one game

that week, there are a couple of other rea-
sons for the rampant upsets each year in
the Big East tournament.
One’ reason is the conference is just
incredibly deep.
V And no team’ has discovered that as
much as the Panthers. Last year, as the
No. 2 seed,-.they were handed a 14-point
loss by West Virginia in their first game.
',Last Thursday, Pitt was held to a measly
‘45 points in a 50-45 loss to Notre Dame,

in the nation at one point. Georgetown
finished the regular season 10-8 in con-
ference play and lost four of its last six

~ games.

Villanova also struggled heading into
the tournament, going 4-5 to close out the
regular season after starting the year 20-1,
including 9-0 in Big East play. Before its
late problems, Villanova was thought to
be in the running for a No. 1 seed in the

' NCAA Tournament. But last Thursday the
Wildcats lost 80-76 to Marquette, which

We won eight of our last nine. They won their last if
four. Those two teams playing in the quarterﬁnals;
r it speaks to our league.

Jamie Dixon

fwhich used a slow, grinding style of play
to throw off the Panthers. .

The Fighting Irish ﬁnished seventh in
the conference at 10-8, and earlier in the
year had a stretch of consecutive loses to
Seton Hall, St. John’s and Louisville.

Just to finish seventh in the Big East,
_Notre Dame had to win its last four games
of the regular season, and was one of the
hotter teams in the-conference heading
,into the tournament.

— “We won eight of our last nine,” ‘Pitt
’Head Coachjamie Dixon said after the loss
to N otre Dame. “They won their last four.

Those two teams playing in the quarterﬁ-
nals; it speaks to our league.” '
‘ Also last Thursday, top-seeded Syra-
fcuse lost its first game of the tournament
with a 91-84 defeat to Georgetown. The
;Orange lost just three games during the
regular season and were ranked No. 1

was the No: 5 seed in the tournament.
But it’s not just the depth of the Big
East that leads to numerous upsets come
tournament time — it’s the history be-
tween all the teams. _
“That’s what’s great about the tourna-
ments,” Villanova Head Coachjay Wright
said after his _team’s loss to Marquette.
“We’ve all played each other. We know each
other  Our familiarity with each other
makes it tough beating. any team.”

. And it’s that knowledge of each other

that makes Big East teams happy when
they get to venture out of conference later
in the postseason. _ ,

“Teams in our league at this stage of
the year know how to attack us,” Syracuse
Head Coach Jim Boeheim said afterthe
Orange’s loss to Georgetown. “We’re look-
ing forward to get out and play somebody
that hasn’t seen us.

Cardinals send Panthers
to early round exit

Pitt lost to Louisville in the first round of Big East tourney

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ Writer

The Panther women entered their first-
round game of the Big East tournament
with both a positive attitude and a recent
win over their Louisville opponent.

Entering the conference tournament
with the hope of gaining an NCAA Tour-
nament berth, the 12th—seeded Panthers
were upset by the 13th—seeded Cardinals,
79-71-

Less than one month before the tourna-
ment meeting between the Panthers and

at Louisville offensive‘ attack that the Pan;
ther_s could not contain.

Part of the Panther’s ineffective de-
fense resulted from foul trouble, which
has plagued the team throughout the
season. _

Taneisha Harrison, Shayla Scott and.
Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson fouled out of};
the game whereas Chelsea Cole contribéfé
uted four fouls to the team total. 

Wilson, the Panthers’ sophomore cenélj
ter, acknowledged the difficulty of defense;
when fouls are an issue. I ~

couple of people with four fouls, your first

the Cardinals, Pitt secured a 72-69 victory

~ over Louisville in a regularseason home

game last month.

Pitt Head Coach Agnus Berenato noted
her disappointment —— and shock — in
her team’s early exit from the Big East
tournament. *

“We really came here feeling like we
could win, this game and stay until tomor-
row,” Berenato said. “I wasn’t prepared
for it to be over. I wasn’t prepared to be
knocked out of the tournament.”

The Cardinals’ Monique Reid, named
the Most Improved Player in the Big East

Conference, played a large role in the Pan!

thers’ loss. g —
With a game-high 32 points, Reid led

thought is not to foul,” Wilson said. “But.
at the same time, you don’t want to give;
up easy baskets.”

The Panthers were almost able to coun-
teracttheir defensive struggle with of-
fensive production as Cole,]ania Sims and
Brittaney Thomas turned in double-digit
scoring performances. ‘

Thomas led the team with 21 points and-—

Cole earned her sixth consecutive double-
double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.
Sims tallied 10 points in the contest. _
However, a late 10-2 run by the Cardi-if
nals in the ﬁnal four minutes of the game
kept the Panthers from closing in on a
victory. 7 ~

surge, the Panthers suffered from an of- ‘

fensive drought in the closing minutes of
the game, especially as their leading scorer
struggled to ﬁnd the net.

As the game _came to a end, Thomas
missed a key free throw as well as a three-
point shot that might have helped to spark
the Panthers to combat the Cardinal’s
rush. —

“[Missing shots] was really frustrating,
especially the free throw,” Thomas said.
“The three-point shot was really rushed,
but the free throw, that was just, I don’t
know.” .

Thomas, under the instruction of Be-

renato, recentlyemerged as a leader for
the Panthers in the final games of the
season.
. “Coach has been talking to me and giv-
ing me a lot of conﬁdence,” Thomas said.
‘FI feel like usually when I need to step up
and score, I do.” -.

Berenato echoed this sentiment, as well
as honored her two Big East Honorable
Mention players, Cole and Sims.

“Thomas has really come on strong and
has showed no fear,” Berenato said, “And
we had two players on Big East Honor-
able Mention, which I am excited about.
I am happy they performed well, but I’m

extremely disappointed overall.”

The Panthers left the Big East tourna-
ment after the ﬁrst-round loss while the
Cardinals went on to fall to Notre Dame
89-52 in the next round of play.

The dominant Connecticut Husl<;”:«'i.;\
captured the tournament championship,
by soundly defeating the West Virginia
Mountaineers 60-32. .

The Huskies won ﬁve out of the last

six conference tournament titles and are

currently riding a 72—game winning streak
into the NCAA tournament.

Connecticut has been a force in the Big
East in recent years, as they have also won
the regular season conference title three
years in a row.

The Huskies will find themselves in the
top seed of the NCAA Tournament, but‘:-he
once—hopeful Panthers will seek other op-
portunities for postseason play.

Berenato still wants her team to find
success as they anticipate a Women’s Na-
tional Invitation Tournament invitation.

With the Tournament selection an-
nounced on Monday night, Berenato hopes
that the Panthers will earn a spot in the
bracket and then “go back to the drawing
board and take a few days to collect their
thoughts.”
