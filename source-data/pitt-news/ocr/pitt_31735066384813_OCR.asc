-. A special committee set up by
the State House to investigate
spending practices of state-related

V schools has apparently found no
misuse of state funds.

The committee, initiated last
February, comprises six members
and chaired by Representative
Fred A. Trello, D-Coraopolis.

Committee FindsDifficu|ties Investigating Schools

News Analysis

The committee was created to
satisfy Trello and other Repre-

sentatives who refused to approve

an increase in the personal income
tax from 2 to 2.2 percent last
..December. The budgetary delays
‘ gummer kept Pitt and other
-related institutions in the
dark over state funding until
approval in December.
“It (the committee) was the
‘ outcome of a situation when Mr.
Trello cast his vote,” Dr. Edward
Bozik, executive assistant to

Chancellor’ Posvar said last night.
Pitt, Penn State, Temple and

Lincoln universities willspend $250

million in state funds this year.

Since organized, the committee
has held only one meeting thus
far-—_-that being with Penn State
officials two weeks ago. Admini-
strators at Pitt have stated that the
University has yet to be ap-
proached by the Trello committee.

“We‘ have had no official
inquiriesfrom the Trello commit-
tee,’l Bozik said.

Although the House is currently
in recess ’ until the fall, the
committee may continue to meet
during this time, according to
Bernard Kobosky, vice chancellor
for public _affairs.

Documentation to questions
asked by the committee is to be
provided by Penn State officials this
week.

“So far Mr. Trello has not indi-
°cated that the committee will come
(to Pitt) or whether he will continue
his meetings after the Penn State
meeting," Kobosky said.

“They (committee members)

have not written us. Neither (Pitt ,

lobbyist) Tom . Lamb, myself or
anyone have been approached,” he

added. - - ..

In authorizing the committee last
winter, the House adopted a
resolution urging the committee to
determine “whether the funds
appropriated to such colleges and

universities are being used in"anv

efficieht and effective manner. It is
important that these matters be
determined before such appro-
priations are again voted.”

The House, Senate and Governor
Shapp have already approved the
1978-79 budgets for s-tate-related
institutions, including a 4 percent
increase in aid for Pitt. _

Trello has stated in The Pitts-
burgh Press that the lack of results
by his committee were linked to
“uncooperative" members, claim-
ing the committe refused to
authorize the use of $25,000 to hire a
researcher.

Pitt Affirmative Action
Not Hurt Bye’Bcikke'

By TOM KUKUCKA
_ Pitt News StalTWriter ‘ _

The recent Supreme Court reverse discrimination decision allowing
Allan P. Bakke to be admitted to the University of California-Davis
Medical School ‘ ‘would not have any drastic effect’ ’« on Pitt’s afﬁrmative
action program, according to Roy Byrd, administrative assistant in the
University’s Office of Affirmative Action.

Byrd said that the additional ruling in the Bakke case, assuring the
constitutionality of affirmative action programs, would allow equal

opportunity programs across the country to continue. He added that in the
future, legislatures would most likely act to strengthen affirmative action
programs as a result of the ruling.

‘ ‘I don’t see it (the Bakke decision) having any effect initially because
affirmative action programs were proven to be constitutional,” Byrd
said. _.“In the longer run I would think it would have some affect in
legislation.’’ ,

Byrd said the University does not employ the use of quotas in selecting
undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty and staff

7 personnel.

“There are no departments at the University that have any quotas
established,” he said. “There are goals set but they are by no means hard
and fast ﬁgures.” ‘

The quota system at UC-Davis was ruledillegal by the higher court
because it set aside 16 positions for every 100 in the freshmen class for
blacks and minorities without taking any additional factors into
consideration.

CAIRO, Egypt—Egypt un-
veiled a new six-point Mideast
peace plan yesterday calling for
Israeli withdrawal from the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank of
the Jordan River, including
Eastderusalem.

But the main elements of the

_ plan already have been rejected
by Israel and Egyptian diplo-
mats who say they have little
hope for a breakthrough.

Israel radio called the plan
“rigid and reflecting no
change” in President Anwar
Sadat’s stand.”

Israeli government officials
withheld immediate comment
on the proposal, which also
stipulates Israel must abandon
Jewish settlements built in the
occupied teritory. A~ decision on

Egypt Peace Plan Calls For Israeli   Withdrawal

Minister Moshe Dayan to
London for a meeting with
Egyptian and American
officials later this month to
discuss the plan probably will
not be made until Sunday’s
Israeli cabinet meeting.

Israel has said it will not
withdraw from the occupied
territories and will not give up
any of the settlements there.
Even the opposition Labor Party
in Israel has said it would be
willing to withdraw only from
certain areas of the West Bank.

The Egyptian plan, prepared
at the urgingsof the United
States, calls for a five-year
transitional period during
which the occupied territories

0 will be administered by "freely
elected” representatives of the

supervision of Jordan on the military Government would be

West Bank and Egypt in Gaza. ‘

The future of the 1.l_ million
Palestinians will be decided
after the transition period.

The plan calls for talks
involving Egypt, Jordan, Israel
and “the representatives of the

.Palestinian people” with the
participation of the United
Nations to discuss details of the
transitional Government, a
timetable for Israeli with-
drawal, mutual security
arrangements, and any other
issues all sides can agree to
discuss.

It suggests that only after
agreement is reached on all
these issues would the Israelis
be expected to begin a
U.N.—supervised pullout from
the territories captured in the

dismantled at the beginning of
the transition period.

Any security arrangements
would be guaranteed by Egypt
and Jordan “and will continue
to be respected in the West
Bank and Gaza.” It appeared
this clause was meant to allay
Israeli fears’ of a vengeful
Palestinian entity from which
terrorists would be free to
attack the Jewish state.‘

No reference was made to the
Palestine Liberation Organiza-

A tion, with which Israel refuses

to negotiate, and it was unclear
who the Palestinian represen-
tatives would be. It also left
unanswered the question of
compensation for Palestinian
refugees and how immigration
would be handled. '

Most _ students who work part-
time can take home more dollars in
their paycheck. Many don’t even
know it. , 

According to the IRS, most
students earn less than $2,950 "a
year, and do not have to ﬁle a tax
return. If income tax was withheld,
however, they have to ﬁle a Federal

‘tax return each year to get their

money Hack.

Instead, students can have their
employers stop deducting income
tax. .

Students who expect to earn less
than $2,950 in 1978 are urged to ﬁle 1...-‘“-

 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

  Shapp’s Veto

Milton Shapp hasn’t managed to do much right during his four
years as Governor. Still, he deserves a bit of praise for his con-

.sistant opposition to the reinstatement.of the death penalty.

Shapp’s veto of the death penalty bill marks the second time he

- has refused to sign a bill attempting to establish capital punishment

in the state. Explaining his veto, he said he believed the death
penalty offeredno) deterrent effect, and that it would only lull
citizens into a false sense of security.

Shapp’s reasoning is the exact reason why we oppose capital
punishment. Every study on the death penalty has shown that it
fails to deter potential murderers from killing. One survey in
Philadelphia done some years ago illustrates the uselessness of
capital punishment as a deterrent.

The study correlated the weekly murder rate with the execution
day at the Philadelphia prisons. Since executions were always on
the same day and publicized in the local newspapers, reserachers
expected that the murder rate would be lowest the days nearest the
executions (if capital punishment had a deterrenteffect). In the
end, the study showed the murder rate did not fall during the days
near the execution date, and concluded thatexecutions did not curb
potential murderers.

Without any detrimental effect, the death penalty can serve no
useful purpose. In fact, -if one considers the past application of the
death sentence, one find it only punishes those too poor and under-
privileged to afford a decent lawyer. As one Supreme Court Justice
said when the court originally ruled the deat penalty uncon-
stitutional, capital punishment strikes with the justice of lightning —
against the poor and minorities.

Life imprisonment—without the possiblity of parole in the case
of mass murderers and other incorrigibles—seems better and more
humane punishment for murder. This penalty could prevent the
“lightning justice” that characterizes capital punishment’s ap-
plication in the United States. Furthermore, it prevents society
from condemning murder on the one hand while it hypocritically
condones killing when it is done by the state.

Letters to the Editor

A Squirrel and Modern Morality

As I walked by the Cathedral of
Learning today, I saw a good
example of today’s morals. An
eight- or nine-year.old boy found
one of the squirrels (which daily run
around our school) drowning in the
fountain. Instead of trying to help,
this boy proceeded to throw stones
at the trapped animal in a brutal
attempt to kill it.

I_managed to stop the boy and save
the squirrel, but much to my
surprise, when I mentioned the
incident to a friend, the response
was. “So what! It’s only a squirrel.”

Maybe it was a squirrel, but what
if it had been a human being in the

place of that helpless animal?

Would we stand idly by as one of our
best friends got killed? In our society
based on life, can we say who lives or
dies? Is life so cheap that we can see
it destroyed?

I say, “No! ” It’s about time we, as
citizens of this great country, got out

of our chairs and did something’ '

before it gets too far out of hand. Life
is as beautiful thing, something to
ﬁght for, something to strive for!

The decision to uphold the

California Supreme Court’s ruling
——that Allan P. Bakke had been

-unfairly discriminated against and

should be admitted to the
University of California Medical
College at Davis—is a culmination
of the conservative backlash against
equal rights.

The roots of this backlash can be
found in Justice Department policy
under President Nixon. Under
Attorney General John Mitchell’s
control, the Civil Rights Division
activity slowed to a snail’s pace.

sponse to the grumbles from many
Americans who felt blacks were
receiving too many ‘privileges,
while the “silent majority” was
being ignored. Unfortunately,
these complaints about special
privileges still continue today.

During 5 discussion about
Ellison's “The Invisible Man,” last
winter term the professor asked the
class whether they believed blacks
receive equal rights in the United
States. Most of the predominately
white class agreed they did.

Comments by one white co-ed in
the class drew murmus of support
from the class. She complained that
blacks on her floor in the Towers
never went to classes, partied a lot
and usually dropped most of their
courses. The professor wryly‘
noted, “That sounds like most of
the whites I went to college with.”

This apt reply illustrates the
fallacy underlying reverse discri-

mination complaints. Chronic com-
plainers merely point to a few
blacks who take advantage of the
rights granted them, forgetting
that such behavior is not exclu-
sively limited to minorities.

They conveniently ignore whites
who exhibit the same laziness and
never mention blacks who excel in
the opportunities granted them by
affirmative action programs. Re-
verse discrimination _complaints
soon disintegrate into veiled racism
when one recalls these points,
which are so clearly’ overlooked by
those who claim “reverse discrimi-
nation.”

The Bakke decision now gives
new hope to those whites who use
discrimination charges to under-
mine the moves toward equality
made in this country over the last
two-and-a-half decades. Before the
ruling attacks against equal rights
provisions were already so strong,
they prompted Assistant Attorney
General Drew S. Days III, of the
Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division to comment: “...affirma-
tive action, voluntary action is
presently under vigorous attack."

And the elements in the United
States who are fighting to destroy
equality for all may not only be
encouraged, but also vindicated by

the Bakke case.

Public Workers Lack OSHA Protection

2 Employees Risk Life and Limb in Public Sector

 

By The Associated Press

NEW YORK-—Somewhere below

you, a sewer worker handling
bacteria-laden filth is risking
hepatitis.

At street level, a highway

repairman is grimy with benzene
and coal tar pitch-—kn6wn cancer
agents.

And somewhere above you,
scaling cables hundreds offeet up, a
bridge maintainer is risking his
neck to change ornamental light-
bulbs.

Alongside the numerous ofﬁce
jobs, the payrolls of state and local
governments are peppered with
jobs like these. On average,
working for the public is more than
three times as dangerous as
performing the average job in
private industry, according to
recently published ﬁgures from the
National Safety Council.

A recent Labor Department study
found that injuries to Federal
workers are, costing the Govern-
ment about $5 billion a year in direct
costs and lost productivity. No
ﬁgures exist on what public
employee injuries are costing state
and local government, but those

costs are likely in the billions, too.
In New York alone, Mayor

Edward Kock has estimated that the '

21,000 disabling public worker
injuries each year are costing the
city nearly $100 million.

Labor and urban experts say the
growing health and safety hazards
public employees face are a hidden
consequence of the money crunch
affecting local government in the
1970s, especially in the Northeast.

The workplaces and tools of these
jobholders-—the public buildings»
roads, bridges and tunnels, the ﬁre
equipment, the-garbage trucks——are
deteriorating, and local govern-
ments have less to spend on repairs
and replacement.

The Urban Institute calculates
that city and state governments
spent the equivalent of $10 billion
less in 1977 than the $36.4 billion
spent in 1970 for capital needs,
taking inﬂation into account.

The safety council’s latest injury
ﬁgures, which combine the years
1974 throughi1976, show that in all
industries, there were 10.87
disabling injuries, and 668 missed
workdays, per million hours
worked. But ‘public employees
suffered 37.55 disabling injuries,

and lost 1,174 work-days, per
million hours worked.

Federal job safety laws formulat-
ed in 1970 require, among other
things, that private industry keep
track of safety and health conditions
in the workplace. They also protect
private sector workers who com-
plain about unsafe job conditions
from losing their jobs.

But city and state employees have
no such Federal protection. The
Occupational Safety and Health Act
(OSHA) of 1970 speciﬁcally ex-
cludes state ‘and local workers from
its provisions. Twenty-four states
have adopted OSHA-like safeguards
for public.employees. But in the
remaining 26 states, public workers
have virtually none of the workplace
safety protections that private
segtor workers have.

The safety council’s ﬁgures, and
interviews with labor.experts in and
out of government, reveal how some
of the more dangerous private and
public jobs compare:

The average garbage collector is
injured on the job twice as often as
the average coal miner, who holds
the most hazardous private sector
job, according to the council’s

statistics. Mining injuries tend to be
far more severe, however.

Coal miners also face black lung
disease‘ from the air they breathe.
The New York City Health
Department found that sanitation
men have twice the rate of heart
disease as other workers in similar
age groups. Walking as they do
behind garbage trucks, they
breathe in high levels of exhaust
fumes.

And a recent study by the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency
found that four out of ten solid waste
workers are injured each year, have
a nine percent chance of having a
limb amputated during their work
life, and a 23 percent chance of
ending up with some sort of
permanent disability. W

“Yet, ironically, a sanitation
worker employed by a private
contractor hauling trash is covered
by the federal OSHA Act, while one
who works for a city, county or a state
is not,” says J oe_ Adler, an ofﬁcial of
the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees.

Fireﬁghters have the highest
death rate of any job, at 70 deaths per
100,000 workers, 10 percent higher

Kosygin Accuses U.S. of Hampering Full Trade

By The Associated Press

MOSCOW—Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin accused the United States
yesterday of hampering U.S.-Soviet
economic cooperation by unwilling-
ness to establish normal trade
relations. He spoke at the opening of
the regular summer session of the
Supreme: Soviet, Russia’s par-
liament.

Listening intently in the ornate
Kremlin meeting hall was President
Leonid I. Brezhnev, 70, looking
tanned and rested. There have been
reports that he is in poor~health.
Brezhnev likely will not address the
meeting, which is expected to last
two or three days.

Also present was Nikoai V.

three seats of him, although the
other seats around him were full.

In Washington, State Depart-
ment spokesman Hodding Carter
declined comment on Kosygin’s
remarks.

Kosygin, 74, said Moscow trades
with 118 countries, but U.S.-Soviet
trade amounts to only 2 percent of
Russia’s foreign business.

“This indicates that economic
cooperation with the United States
is, in effect, still ‘at the outset,”
Kosygin said. The reason; he said,
was “the unwillingness of the
United States to establish normal
conditions for trade.”

It was an indirect reference to the
1972 U.S.-Soviet trade agreement

never implemented because of an

attempt by the U.S. Congres to link it U,S,-soviet

with Jewish emigration.

Some Jews in the Soviet Union
claim they are discriminated against
and are not permitted to emigrate.
More than 130,00 Soviet Jews have
gone to Israel, but Jews in the Soviet
Union and abroad say many more
who want to go are kept form doing
so. ‘

The pact called for increased
economic cooperation between the
two countries and for granting the
Soviets “most favored nation”
trading status with the Unied States,
which would assure the Soviet tariff
advantages as good as those of any
other American trading partner.

When the pact passed Congress
two years later it contained the

‘Jackson-Vanik Amendment, linking
trade to increased
Jewish emigrationfrom the Soviet
Union.

Outraged, the Soviets refused to
implement the agreement and
‘U.S.-Soviet trade slumped as the
Kremlinturned to the West
Germany, Japan and other
countires. The issue remains a sore
point.

than the next highest,- the coal

miner, at 63 deaths per 100,000

workers. Police average 39 deaths ,
per 100,000 workers. The average

for all industries is 14 deaths per

100,000 workers.

Firemen can expect to be injured
four times as often, and twice as
severely, as a steel foundry worker,
according to the safety council.

Many health and safety risks to
policemen, ﬁremen and others in the
public‘ sector are obvious and well
known. Police, for instance know the
violent risks of interrupting a family
ﬁght, and ﬁremen know that
exposure to 350-degree heat on the V
job means an increased risk of lung
problems and heart attacks.

But Mike Smith, an official of the
International Association of Fire-
fighters, says there are now
occasional reports in large cities of
ﬁremen being shot by arsonists in
the course of ﬁghting ﬁres.

There have also been instances of
arsonists apparently sawing holes in
the ﬂoors of buildings so that
ﬁremen attempting to ﬁght the blaze
fall through the ﬂoor and injure w
themselves. 1

Relations

Kosygin, in his speech, said his
country has been expanding econ-
omic cooperation with socialist and
capitali/st countries. The United
States sells more than its buys in
dealings with the Soviet Union.

U. S. -Soviet trade ﬁgures show the
United States exporting goods worth
$1.62 billion to the Soviets in 1977,
down 30 percent from 1976.

Meanwhile, Peterson said second
baseman Rennie Stennett would

after more than a month on the

Parker, who sustained the facial
fracture in a home plate collision,
had been chosen as a reserve on the
National League All-Star squad for
the July 11 game in San Diego,
Peterson revealed.

The team has not been officially
released, but Peterson said he had

Experience Will Spell
‘Can’t Miss’ for “Jones  

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Rated as ‘ ‘a can't-miss prospect”
prior to last season, “Rooster”
Jones, who gained nearly 2,000
yards as a senior at Pascagoula
(Miss.) High School, was consider-
ed as good a candidate as any to step
in and fill Tony Dorsett’s vacated
spot at tailback.

As it turned out, Jones never
lived up to those expectations..
While Freddy Jacobs started,
Jones, gained 56 yards on 22 carries
and spent most of the season on the
bench.

Although 56 is a far cry from the
1,895 yards he gained as a high
school senior, Jones doesn’t believe
last season was a total waste.
According to the sophomore
running back, the inactivity gave
him some time ‘to learn the Pitt
offense. ,

“I would have liked a little more
playing time, but I knew that was
expecting too much too early,” he
said.

‘-“I really didn’t know all the plays
that well,” continued Jones, who
made the switch to Pitt’s veer

"offense from the I-formation used

by his high school. “It took me the

whole year just to understand the
offense.”

With Pitt’s season opener at
Tulane just a few months away,
Jones claims to know the offense
better. That knowledge, coupled
with the showing in spring
practice-—when he won the Ed
Conway Memorial Award (given to
the team’s most improved player)-
J ones might ha.ve the season people

. were expecting from him last year.

“I hope so,” he said. “I have my

p mind set on playing more. I’ve
matured in a lot of ways. I just hope I ‘

get the playing time.”
Jonesadded that he feels more
relaxed than he ever has since
coming to Pitt.
‘ ‘I was a nervous wreck there for a

while,” he said. “I was getting all I

that publicity, and people . were
telling me that maybe I could start.
It was nice, but it did put a little too
much pressure on_ me.”

Jones has no goals for either this I

season or the rest of his career.

“I take it season by season,” he
said, hinting he wouldn't mind
gaining 600 or 700 yards this coming
season. ‘‘I’m not the big-headed
type who needs to set individual
goals. I just want to play.”

Meanwhile, Peterson said
Stennett would stay with the club,
though how much he plays remains
to be seen. .

Stennett was forced to leave a
game Sunday because of intense,
recurring pain in his right ankle.

But he left with the Pirates for a
road trip to St. Louis after being
examined yesterday by Dr. Albert
Ferguson, an orthopedic surgeon.

“Dr. Ferguson said he's all right
to go to St. Louis and play—-if he can
play,” Peterson said.

Parker, who sustained three
cracks in his left cheekbone in a
run-in last‘ Friday night with New
York Mets catcher John Steams,

 

was re-examined at Eye and Ear
Hospital by Dr. Eugene Myers.
“Dr. Myers said he should be
operated on. Right now, they are
planning to have the operation
Thursday morning,” said Peterson.
He said the main problem is that
the cheekbone is ‘depressed in one
area, inhibiting movement of
Parker’s jaw and posing potential
problems with his sinuses.
“There’s an indentation where
one of the cracks is, and the only
way to remedy that is to operate,”
said Peterson. He said doctors
would try to push the bone back into
line from inside Parker’s mouth.
“If that doesn’t work, they'll

have to operate from the outside
and wire it to hold it in place,” he
said.

Parker’s roster replacement,
Nicosia, was "batting .333 at
Columbus with nine home runs and
54 RBIs.

Meanwhile, Kison will also join
the team today; Kison went on the
disabled list May 28 with a chronic
blister problem on the tip of the
middle finger on his pitching hand.

“We are going to go with 11
pitchersfor a while instead of the
normal 10 until we make sure
Kison’s finger is all right. It's been
fine throwing in the bullpen,” said
Peterson.

Joe Paterno, coach at Penn State, proposed a plan
that would have the schools in the semifinals and

played with the remainder of the money to be placed

The proceeds would be used “to help people with

indicated their desire to sign

underage juniors. They based their

decision on the Ken Linseman court
ruling of last year that it was not legal
in the United States to deprive a
qualiﬁed player, no matter what his

age, of the right to earn a living.

The 19-year-old Linseman was the
Rookie of the Year with Birmingham
last season after signing a disputed
contract with the Bulls.

Indianapolis recently announced
a multi-year contract with 17-year-
old Wayne Gretsky, who felt “if I can
play professional hockey now, why
shouldn’t I?’’

The WHA will conduct an
interleague draft today, with each
team being allowed to protect 12
skaters and two goaltenders. There

will be no amateur draft conducted
by the WHA this year.
