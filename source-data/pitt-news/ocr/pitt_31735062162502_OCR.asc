_ Spring Festival and Homecoming Week planswere the
major topics of discussion at the Student

Government Assn.

Homecoming committee chairman, Bobb Ossip, explained
further the plans for this year’s ﬂoat-building procedures for
Homecoming ‘Week. Students were concerned at the meeting
. ¢that they had "not been conferred

with in regard to float-building

‘ group participation.

‘Kent Jarrell, president of
SGA, said that the association»
has “complete conﬁdence in each
and every chairman they ap-
point. SGA found no cause at
today’s meeting to recommend a
change in the proposed plans.”
A further meeting to discuss
this subject will be held today
in 817 C1. _
.Three dates for university ac-
tivities were submitted. and ap-
proved at' the -meeting. These are
Dec. 16, Commons Room Dance;
March 23, .Tap Day, and May 17-
20, Spring Festival.
- A Spring Festival discussion-
meeting will be held Sept. 3.0.
Time ‘and location will be ‘an-

nounced later. All persons having-

an interest in the Festival have
been invited to this meeting.‘
A motion that SGA join the
National Student Assn. was de-
feated at Monday’s meeting. The
National Student Assn. is com-
posed of the student governing
‘ associations of 400 universities
in the United States and Canada.
Their primary usefulness to a
s t u d e n t governing association
would lie in information that they
provide concerning problems in
this ﬁeld, it was _said.

By a vote of the members of .

SGA, Ray Rowney was_ elected
as the group’s corresponding sec-
retary to ﬁll this position va-
cated by Linda Strickler as a re-
sult of a schedule conflict. -

The new, controversial plan
consists of having the Homecom-
ing Committee determine which
groups will work. together on
floats as opposed to having the
individual fraternities invite so-

he said, “by a group of the fra-

Khrushchev has received some
erroneous reports which need to
be straightened out.”

Margie Nicolacopoulos, Arts,

. V Thursday, Sept. 24, will be a momentous day for the
‘University of Pittsburgh. Nikita S. Khrushchev, whose offi-
cial title is “Chairman of the Council of Ministers for the

{fncheon here that day.
A; "It is considered an _
Lrthe one university in the United States that Mr. Khrushchev
ilwill see during his ten-day visit to this country. Just what

-.still not known. . . ,
"1  ’ Of course, he will spend part of the afternoon in the
-.S__tudent Union Ballroom at the luncheon. It seems likely
vhe will want to see other parts of the campus although his
‘schedule will be closely clipp,ed./ _

 A But even if he does not have time or does not choose to_
lview anything else, it is almost deﬁnite that other members
j_,of his party will tour sections of the university which speci-
jﬁcally interest them.

It will be even more an honor
j‘ Khrushchev chooses to deliver a major address at the lunch-
"eon. Everything points to the probability that such an
address will be made. After all, it will be the premier’s
_ﬁna1 opportunity to make such an address.

 ‘ Since it will be the last stop on the tour, he will have a
{chance to comment on ‘everything he will have seen in his‘
‘*-ﬁ_rst,. and undoubtedly only, visit to theUnited States. A
Khrushchev address would carry the name of the university
allzover _the world.

5 ' Naturally, there are many who oppose the Russian’s
visit because of_the activities of the Communist Party in
'3' .7Eastern Europe, as well as various’other parts of the world.
A However, we look upon the visit of Mr. Khrushchev as
the visit of the head of one of the two great governments
of the world. In thisrespect we must consider Mr. Khrush-
chev a distinguished guest. . .

_ Since he will be here in such a capacity, we must treat
him as we would any other distinguished guest. He is in
;this country as the guest of President Eisenhower and he
~:-Twill be at this universityas a guest of Chancellor Litchﬁeld.
. ‘ Some 300 correspondents from many foreign nations

will be covering the visit. Any attitude, other than that
which would seem sensible on the part of university‘ stu-
dents, would be so reported. ' ‘

next, week would result in anything but the excellent
opportunity it presents us.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower returned to
Paris on September 2. Fifteen years and one week
before, as chief of the allied “Army of the Liber-
ation,” Eisenhower had arrived in Paris to deliver
the French capital from the hands of the German
Occupation-. Parisians demonstrated that they still
regard Eisenhower as “The General.”

The streets and boulevards leading from Le
Bourget Airport into the center
of,Paris were lined with people "
early in the morning as General
de Gaulle went out to greet the
presidential plane which landed
a little after eight.

As the long, black limousine
carryingede Gaulle and Eisen-
hower appeared at the airport Q
gates, a cheer arose in the as-
sembled crowd which moved like
a steady wave toward Paris with
the progress,of the official car. '

As the parade moved with precision toward the
Quai d’Orsay, it turned down Rue Scribe which
adjoins the Place de l’Opera: ,,_At, this ' famous
corner stands the Paris oﬁ’ice of the American Ex-

 

press Company, home away from home and refuge A

for all American citizens. American Express had
all its ﬂags waving (with 49 stars) and its Ameri-
can patrons on its steps. Had it been the Republi-
can convention of 1960, Eisenhower would have
received no greater ovation. ' A

In the afternoon, following his first discussion
with de ‘Gaulle, the President was fprmally wel-
comed. Preceded by an armada of red—white-blue-
clad motorcycle policemen’ wearing shining steel
helmets, Eisenhower and de Gaulle rode in the
open limousine up the Champs Elysees to the‘“Arc
de Triomphe where the President placed a wreath
at the foot of the memorial to the,Unknown French
Soldier. _

I waited for the President at the‘I-Iotel de Ville,
the “city hall” of Paris. Here the .mayor "of the
civic council was to present the gold key to the
city to Mr. Eisenhower and General de Gaulle
would oﬁicially welcomehim on behalf of that new

‘attempt at stability, the Fifth Republic.

Praise from L'Express

A reviewing stand had been set up on the steps
of the hall, and it was covered with burgundy-
colored velvet. The gendarmes were everywhere,

even on top of chimneys of surrounding buildings,
dressed in their ﬁnest uniforms. Movie and tele-
vision cameras were perched on platforms raised
above the crowds. A.mi1itary band was playing
martial airs, as black Renaults and Citrons arrived
carrying city and national pfﬁcials. I moved as
close to the reviewing stand as possible, and,» to
pass the time, bought a copy of the weekly news
journal L’Express.i A color picture of Mr. Eisen-
hower was on the cover, and an inside article
proudly announcedthat this was the ﬁrst time that’
the paper had ever published in color and that

 

“cover boy.” The caption under the President’s I
picture was a quote from Guizot, “The world be-
longs to the optimists.” .
The page three editorial declared that Mr.
Eisenhower was the undisputed leader of the free
world and that the French people hoped. that he
indeed might be able to halt the march of Russia
by personally moulding the Western Alliance andijl  
its peoples into a uniﬁed, purposeful whole. I
The high-pitched cries of the French school , , A

the ‘platform, acknowledged the cheers, and re‘-—~
ceived the key to the city. Then General de Gaulle, A

took the rostrum to welcome his. old comrade in’

Thecrowd hungupon each word and cheered’ 7 
exuberantly at every pause. The General" noted"
that the talks had gone “very well” that morning.
The'President, in English, with a short speech of
thanks for his warm welcome and said with ob-
vious feeling that Paris had become forhim, as it
had for all Americans, a special city, “a place very
dear to‘ our hearts.” He concluded "with the French 
phrase which he hoped would explain his feelings
at that moment, “Je vous aime -tous.” (I like *
you all.) _ - " ' '

p The crowd applauded long and loud at "the "
familiar phrase in their own language. The official '
party re—entered their cars and headed for the
Elysees Palace for dinner. The thousands of”;
Parisians. (and visitors) dispersed,_ most- of them
smiling and talking of “cet americain gentil” 
that pleasing American." Again, high praise fromw
a Parisian. '

Art and Co—Eds

By Ina Amdur

The subject of women incollege never ceases
to be an amusing one to educators, parents, and
many times to the women themselves. So far it
has been decided that the major reason most
women are in college is that they can use it as
a hunting ground for husbands.- A -

Few use it as aserious means to gainknowledge
and fewer yet use it as a way to
gain preparation for a perma-
nent career. However, John
Ciardi, in‘ his commencement
speech at Wells college, has of-
fered a sensible and, meaningful
answer to the question of what
women should attempt to gain
from college. A

Ciardi uses a phrase of Mat-
thew Arnold to describe the
purpose of a liberal arts educa-
tion: “To see life steadily and
to see it whole.” Ciardi harbors no utopian view
of our colleges and realizes that it-is the excep-
tional liberal arts graduate who sees life steadily
or worries about such an abstract term called life.
Affable Bu1l' Dumb

American society has taught each undergraduate
well in the past 22 years that the important thing
is to use his college education to help him make
more money as quickly'as possible’. On the way
he might as well pick a partner to share the money
and he begins looking for the ideal American co-
ed. Ciardi immediately illustrates one character-
istic that he is not looking for. “It is not likely
that the affable young man with his destiny in an
attache case is going to scour the summa cum
laude list for a wife.”

These characteristics are what Ciardi thinks
the young manis looking for. His future wife must
be a good mixer, a good dancer, and .“without any
freakishly high brow ideas.” This combination is
not hardvtoﬁnd for mostwomen will automatically
conform jgjto ‘die “advertised standard’-’ as Ciardi

or to gracious living. Life would be less pleasant
if both of these did not exist to some extent. What. .
worries Ciardi is whether today’s gracious college? H" 
women can envision their lives 20 yearsfrom now.",°-=' " ‘E

husband will leave. The children will have been‘/A " ‘
married or will have gone "away to school’ andjlll, 
the ex-college co-ed will be-alone until ﬁve o’,cloc‘k..-A 4
It is at this time which seems so remote, so un-’
real and consequently not worth worrying about
that the fruits of a true education, formal or" in-
formal begin to show. ' ' ' . 
Ciardi has. prepared ‘a list of activitiesjwithj
which most women will‘ ﬁll the nine to ﬁve’ void f
for the last 20 or 30 years of their lives. They twill‘
tour, play bridge, watch television, work on-com-
munity projects, garden and participate in “little
shopping trips with the girls.” - 
If college had meant anything at all to the
many women who spendtheir lives trying des-
perately to ﬁll lonely hours they would not’be"‘

 

 

— in _.that predicament. Instead during the long years ‘

of raising children and of housekeeping they wo’uld \
have found time for what Ciardi simply calls
“art.” Art includes religion philosophy, and his-
tory at their most speculative and least‘dogmatic
dimensions. ' ‘
Readius-Ir College Adjustment ,
The thousands of‘ women in college all over
‘ the country cannot afford to ignore Ciardi’s words.
Freshman women in particular should heed Ciardi’s’
advice, for they have the most time in which to
gain a true education. It will be much more
valuable than the many redundant “col1ege4adl‘U5t- --
ment” orientation‘ sessions. '

He concludes his address with this ‘message:
‘It is this that one -must say to today’s college girls. 0
That they are beautiful, and ignorant, and illusory.
And that only as they learn to shape_ their atten-
tion to‘ the -long memory we call the humanities,
-can they -be beautifuli after the bloom is off, and

and broaden their bliss, there is no need to pay me because I am,

“Oh, very well,” I saitl, and the glbom passed like a summer

a ﬁne new cigarette with a light touch of menthol and the rich

would do well to ask for new king-size Alpines. If, on the other

a ﬁlter that does what it’s built for, ask for Marlboro. Or, ifyou
don’t like ﬁlters at all, but only inildncss, ask for Philip Morris.
Any way you play it, you're a winner.

But I digress. “Will you,” said the makers‘ of Philip Morris,
Marlboro and Alpine, “write about the important issues that
occupy the supple young minds of college America this year in
your column?” .

“But of course,” I replied, with a kindly chuckle.

“And will you,” asked the makers, “from time to time say 3

“Crazy kids!” I said with a wry grin, pushing my list
gently against their jaws. “You know‘I will.” _

 Panthers Ready
I Kickoff May
The Starting Lineup

Decide

By TED COLTON
Just three days remain before John Michelosen’s
Panthers take on the Marquette Warriors at Marquette
Stadium. Kick-off time is slated for 2' p.m. C.D.T. (3 p.m.

Pittsburgh Time).

This will be the season opener for both teams and the
Panthers are hoping to get off to a running start. The com-

petition at some of the positions
of the Blue and Gold is running
so high that Michelosen still has
not determined. his starting line-
up. .

The chances are that is will
probably depend on whether the

' Panthers kick off or receive. The

probable starting line-up will be
from this two deep chart; left

ends, Mike Ditka, Steve Jastre-E

zembski, left tackles; Ken Mon-
tanari, Ernie Westwood, left
guards; Norton Seaman, 'Regis
Coustillac, center; Serafino Fazio,
Andy Kuzneski, right guards; Bob
Longfellow, Larry Vignali right
tackles; Bill Lindner, Dick Mills,
ringt ends; Ron Delfine, John
Kuprok.
The backﬁeld two deep- chart
will have quarterbacks; Ivan
Toncic, Dave Kraus, left half;
chu‘ck Reinhold, Andy Sepsi,
right ‘half; Joe Scisley, Curt
Plowman, fullbacks; Fred Rid-
dle. Jim Cunningham.
Michelosen is satisﬁed with the
condition of the squad. The Pan-
ther tutor stated, “The kids are
in pretty good shape physically:
Mentally it’s hard to say, this is

' the ﬁrst time we have openedthe

season after classes started.
Mental Condition Uncertain

“I don’t know how this» will
affect the boys mentally. There
are many factors that enter into
the boys life that we don’t have
to contend with when there are
no classes.”

The hardest battle for a start-
ing berth is going on at the full-
back position. Both Riddle and
Cunningliam are top notch run-
ners and “hard nose",players.

Riddle has the edge on pass de-
fense and blocking, but Cunning-
ham has been getting that extra
yard in practice so far this year.

It will probably be Riddle if

the Panthers kick, and Cunning-
ham if’ they receive. A surprise
during the fall drills has been
halfback Andy Sepsi. A stand-
out in high school, “Andy has

A
V

never reached his" potential,”
the coach stated.

,“This year he has come into
his own and if he plays as well
in the games as he has in prac-
tice he will be a big help to us.”
Vic Fusia, backﬁeld coach, stated,
“We always felt Andy had it. We
think this year he is going to be
outstanding.” _

In the ﬁnal week of practice
the Panthers are still plagued
with minor injuries to key.per-
sonal. [Foremost on the list is
quarterback Toncic. He has been
working in sweat clothes the last
few practices and is limping bad-.
ly due to a knee injury. How-
ever hopes are high that he will
be ready for Saturday. I

Riddle, Kuprok and Bob Cle-
mens, a halfback, are suffering
from knee injuries. Reinhold has
been bothered with a shoulder in-
jury, while Dick Matyus has a
twisted ankle. Since all the in-
juries are minor the Panthers
should be at full strength Satur-
day.

,“

 

QUARTERBACK Dick Sanker takes the ball through the line on a’
sneak as the Panthers enter their ﬁnal practice sessions before

Saturday’s opener with Marquette in Milwaukee.

Kickoff time

will be 3 p.m., Pittsburgh time. The Panthers are favored to win.

Local Yogis Begin Old Tricks

New Forecasters to Press Pros D  

Well, it’s that time of the year
once again and the local iyogis
(not yokels) are back at their old
tricks. , '

Larry (the old pro) Haggerty
is back trying to uphold his
championship picking form, as he
puts his style on the line against
such nationally known forecasters

as Murray (Boss) Chass and ,
David (Johnny come lately)
Breakstone.

Haggerty, who closed out last
season with .643 average, will be
faced with some new competition
for picker of the week in the
form of Ted,Colton, Bill Neff,
Jack Smith and an anonymous
female.

The yogis unanimously have
given their support to the Pan-

thers with the feeling that the
Blue and Gold will start off the
season in a blaze of glory.

In the game of the weak Pan-

handle A&M is slated as the un-
derdog because of. its unimpres-
sive 1-8 record. .

 

Panhandle’s one big win came.
in a surprising upset of St. Mary’s,
a girls’ school, a power of the
Southern Conference. On the
other hand the powerful McPher-
son which closed out its season
with a 7-ll record reportedly has
another strong team.

“As far as I am concerned it
is almost-senseless to pick the
won and lost columns ahead of
time,‘ but after winning last
year’s Yogi championship I feel
conﬁdent that I will be able to
outguess my boss, Murray, and
once againretain my title”, re-
ports Larry (the old pro) Hag-
gerty. ’ _

Haggerty’s biggest competition
probably will be the female.

Voices Bemis

By JACK SMITH

Year after year Coach Leo
Bemis complains about his lack
of incoming experienced Soccer
talent. But this year-is different‘,
for Bemis not only has experi-
enced men but also has four boys

who. have gained high recognition‘
from their respective areas.

“We have an over—al1 good
freshman squad,” Bemis
‘fFour players who have shown
butstanding ability are Corky
Cuthbert, Pete Smith, Dick Spolar
and Paul Liberatti.”

Cuthbert, a wing from North
Penn High School, in Landsdale,
Pa., gained All-Star. honors and
was league leading scorer in his
senior year. Rated by Bemis as
having a ﬁne-foot,iCuthbert is ex-
pected to strengthen an area
where .the Panthers have always
lacked, at wing.

“Perhaps our most experi-
enced ‘player is. Smith,” stated
Bemis. After winning junior
honors in the. British Isles Smith
came to America, then spent two
years in the Army. Before com-
ing to Pitt, Smith played with
the Heidelberg. Senior team of
the Keystone League.

Two other standouts have been
Paul Liberatti and Dick Spolar,
both from Springdale High
School. Liberatti, the more versi-
tile of the two, was captain of his
high school team and has the
ability to play all positions.

ed for the Harmar Township Soc-
cer team. “These two boys along
with the others mentioned should
give us the foundation of a good
Soccer team,” said Bemis.

Of course —there are others who
could develop enough to be an
asset, but right now it is too
early. to ‘say what fellows will
learn quickly.”
To prepare the frosh boote'rs
for their opener with Shadyside
on Oct. 2, Bemis will, in his prac-
tice games, have the freshmen

W/hatKhrush]|Iight,

SeeDurmgHts Vlslt
. ‘ K By MURRAY CHASS ' '
It is unfortunate that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev

will be on the campus for so "short a time next week. As of
now, his schedule calls for a luncheon at the Student Union

and nothing more. _
If he had the time, and

if he wanted to be given a

thorough tour of an American university, we could show Mr.

Khrushchev‘ a good time here.

It is interesting to realize ex-
actly what all we could have
Khrush (as he is known to his
close friends) see and experience
atthe university.

See Car Fights ,

If he arrived early enough, per-
haps between 7 and 8 a.m., Mr.
Khrushchev could see all the
“capitalistic” students who come
to classes in their own cars. He
would ﬁnd that some of the stu-
dents who have cars aren’t as
capitalistic as others.‘

» He would see anything from
the classiest 1959 sports car, to
the pre-1950 jalopy. However,
he still would be able‘ to wit-
ness America’s philosophy of
equality in action.
/For our Russian guest would
~ watch, perhaps in humor, the bit-
ter and exhausting battle for the
limited parking places around
here. He would._;ﬁnd that those
with the better cars get no more
consideration for places than any
others. '

 

Tuck Shop Next

After he is ﬁnished watching.‘

 this show, Mr. Khrushchev could
, go with us to the Tuck Shop to
catchpa quick cup of coffee with
our" students before they begi
the day’s labors. ~
What a scene. that would pre-
-sent. All those students stand-
, » ing-‘ in line for an eye opener in
 alpaper cup with a wooden fork
":"to stir the cream and sugar
hwitlh. 4 _ -
-. Of "course, we would have to
throw him in with the rest of
the huge_throngs because no mat-
ter who a person is, he- receives
the same push-and-shove treat-
’ ment from the‘ civilized‘ students.
, Russians or Rushing?
While standing there in the
_ room seemingly lit only by the
early morning sunshine coming
through the subterranean win-
’: dows, Mr. —Khrushchev might
‘think he hears someone saying
the Tuck Shop is so crowded at
that time because of the Russians.
But the person re_ally__ said it was
crammed with student’s because
that was rushing time.

Although there are many
courses we would like .our visi-
tor to- ‘audit (we wouldn’t

" charge him anything, not even
> _: I $4 per credit for the university
fee), we would have to limit
them to a few. '
He would have to sit in on one
of those business administration.
' courses which teach the students
how to become capitalists. Maybe
a,stocks and bonds course would
be best. ~

 

Might Fail Course _

Then, just for the fun of it, we
would take him to a political sci-
ence course on democracy. It
seems unlikely that -he wouldn’t
do\too well if the professor asked
him some questions about the
subject. Anyway, he would hear
about things that occur in a de-
mocracy thart he never has seen
at home.

: Perhaps one of the" religion"

A
7

courses would be our next stop.

Mr. Khrushchev, however, might ‘
not enjoy this hour very much.
But again, it would be some-.
thing different for him.

Before leaving the Cathedral,
we would take Mr. Khrushchev
to the Babcock Room, that lux-
urious conference room members
of-the administration use for spec-
ial meetings. Our guest, who un-
til recently handled a glass of

vodka with extreme enjoyment,’

might even pick up a light re-
fresher there. '
Answer Questions

At noon, we would invite Mr.
Khrushchevto speak at the Mid-
day Series. We especially would
be interested in hearing him try
to answer some of the questions
ourstudents could ask him.

Next on our itinerary would ‘

Emerson Club to Meet.

be a stop at one of theiengineer-'
ing buildings. Not so much
would we want the Communist
boss to see an engineering class
(he couldn’t gain too much from
that); but we particularly would
like him to experience climbing
the hill to the building.

That might take much of the

‘starch ou-t of the dictator. Actual-

ly, we. could spend a‘ nickel and
take the campus bus up the hill,
but we would prefer the climb.
Gridiron ’Final Stop

Since ‘ we already would be
halfway up the hill, ‘we might as
well ﬁnish the trip. So up top the
football‘ practice ﬁeld we would
go. Once there, Khrush (by now
he’s our close buddy) would see
the Pitt football team (complete

with all their various pads sweat-K

ing through a few hours of prac-
tice in 90-degree heat. C
And perhaps this would be a
good spot to end “our tour be-
cause this sight no doubt also
would remind our visitor of
home. For with a change of
weather Siberia probably would
come to his mind. *

We would thank Mr. K. for per-
mitting us to show him our
campus, and then he would re-
turn to the Soviet Union pre-

pared to tell everyone there about

American educational facilities.
