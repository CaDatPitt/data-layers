Steeler Fans Jam

By TOM KUKUCKA ~

Pitt News Staff Writer

The procession started approximately 7:30 last night, but most Pitt
students gave up their Super Bowl trek from the paper-strewn Quad to
the downtown area at Craft Avenue and seemed content just to line the

Forbes-Bouquet area and cheer.

“We were having a hardy party in Amos Hall during the game,"
said one student who decided against joining the downtown crowd.
“We weren’t afraid of walking down but it would really have been bad

getting back.”

This last week at Pitt, and throughout the city, was characterized by
an abundance of terrible towels, posters, Steeler tossle-caps, stores
offering specials commemorating the Super Bowl and Jimmy Pol and

his “Pittsburgh Steeler Fight Song.”

But shortly after noon today, campus grounds were quit as most
stayed inside their dorm rooms, crowded fraternities, their favorite
club or bar and even in some cases, a hotel room downtown to beat the
Port Authority Transit/city police shutdown of the Golden Triangle at 6

p.m.

But, after Pittsburgh’s 35-31 victory over Dallas, they didn’t stay

indoors long.

“There were a bunch of crazy people here,” said one student, who

Council
Calls for
Restructuring

Representatives of the Pitt Union
Program Council asked Student
Government Board" at‘ its Friday
meeting for‘ cooperation in re-

my structuring the council.

The program council, plagued
with procedure problems during
Fall Term, recently has begun a
review of its constitution to
eliminate some of those problems.

Laura Brown and Chris Rasmus-
sen, of the council’s Lecture and
Recreation Committees respective-
ly, requested that the post of
general council chairman be
eliminated, a full-time advisor be
hired, and academic credit for
eligible members be given instead
of remuneration.

Terry Milani, associate director

of Student Activities, supported the
proposals, but asked that the
position of ‘general chairperson be
left in the'council’s constitution
until duties of that post—now
vaguely def1ned—are spelled out
clearly. _ .
‘ SGB ‘president Josh Baylson
suggested-that rather than appoint
"or elect a. council chairperson, one
of .the program council six
committee‘ chairpersons actias a
spokesman. _

Brownand Rasmussen came to
SGB one week after Milani
appeared before the board to
outline prospect changes in the
council. .

Milani’s proposal called for the
incorporation of the program

' council’s music and special interest
committeesya minimum of ﬁve
students on each committee, a
turnover of chairmen and members
this term -and small transfers of
money among committees.

Members of the Pitt UnionlProgram Council asked Student Government Board president Josh Baylson to consider
plans for restructuring of the program council.

the city of Pittsburgh will make it through one

—-All students, including under-

graduate part-time students, may

vote in the yearly election.
Currently, only full-time students
may vote;

—An increase in QPA require-

ments for members and the
president from 2.0 to 2.5;
—An increase in Allocations

Also, a change in the name of the
group to “Student Assembly”;

—An increase in the size of the
Judiciary Committee from six to
seven ‘members.

Diane Behers, member of the
Constitutional Review‘ Committee,
which drew up these changes,
explained the reason for the review
and clarified what the changes and
additions will mean.

“The review committee tried to

make the constitution as specific as
possible,” she said. “We tried to
eliminate the possibility of having
wrong interpretations. ”

The constitution up for referen-
dum is more streamlined and
“easier to read,” Behers said.

Committee membership from eight
to nine;

-—the president of the Student
Government Assembly will be
elected from its general member-
ship rather than be a member of
the Student Government Board.

Out there in the Atlantic Ocean on a sunshine beach
there’s goin to be an outbreak of revelry this vacation
break. And a er the sun goes down . . . well, you know the
effect that moonlight has on a celebration. We can only
hope it won't be a full moon.

Because from Jan. 13 through April 21 we’re opening
Nassau and Paradise Island to a wave of American col-
lege students. We have reason to believe that wave may
reach tidal proportions. Probably because of the price:
$269 including airfare and 7 nights hotel.

So there it is, young America. We guarantee you the best
of dancing on the beach, water sports and a roaring party.
Beyond that, you're invited to improvise. And since your
talent for good. timing is legendary, we’ve made prepara-
tions for you. _We’re_ going to be ready. ..

THE COUNCIL oi-' GRADUC
THE WINTER TERM SOCIAL

”We (review ‘committee mem-
bers) figured that if we were having
problems reading the present
constitution, then most "people
couldn’t read it either,” Behers
said. _ A

She emphasized that the review
was not established to change the
overall meaning of the constitution,
but “to make an improvement on
the present constitution.”

The addition of a clause
establishing a president pro-tem-
pore was made because “we felt
the presidency was a fundamental
office in student government,”
Behers said.

Details of succession to the
presidency are included in the

p present constitution, Behers said,

but are listed in constitutional
by-laws, not in the constitution
itself. Listing the president
pro-tempore in the constitution,
she said, makes the procedures
“more standard and basic.”

DiMaccio and Galanski argued for
their stands on various campaign
issues.

Many campus organizations
have endorsed candidates for both
president and board:

The Engineering Student Cab-
inet endorsed DiMaccio for presi-
dent, and Cordisco and Watterson
for board.

The Inter-Residence Board has

A endorsed Galanski for president.

The Inter-Honorary Council has
endorsed DiMaccio for president
and Cordisco, Daley and Watterson
for board. ’

Raising the number of meetings
a board member can miss from
three to four was done because
“most board members work over
the summer and raising the
number allows for difficulties
related to summer jobs,” Behers
stated.

She said changing the date of
assuming office from Mar. 1 to the
first day of Winter term was done
to accomodate the yearly alloca-
tions process.

“No where in, the current
constitution did it refer to when

board members will take ofice, nor,

if they ever would,” Behers said.
Under the present constitution,
policy for allocations is determined
as early as February of each year,
set by lame-duck board members.
“Hopefully, if this change is
passed, board members will meet
with the new board this year to
determine their (allocation) prior-
ities and will adopt them. This way

The College Young Democrats
have endorsed Galanski for presi-
dent, and Daley, Feinberg, Gia-
nella and Park for board.

viewed the game at the Polish Club in Oakland. “I left when itylooked
like they were going to start throwing chairs around.”

Although Oakland traffic, particularly buses. was held up, no
volkswagons were overturned (as in the 1971 Pirate. World Series
victory celebration) and no windows along the Oakland business

district were shattered.

Trash cans overturned and a few stop signs bent out of shape were
the only signs of destruction, although a few overzealous fans were
unsuccessful in an attempt to remove the sign atop C.J. Barney’s

restaurant.-

The crowd around Original’s Hot Dog Shop and the White Tower
restaurant swelled to a‘pickpocket’s delight by 10 p.m., spilling out
onto Forbes and occasionally stopping traffic completely. The police
force in the area was dense at times, but nowhere near the 500-man
force that patrolled the downtown celebration.

“Now that’s what I call waiting for something to happen,” one
student said, observing a parked paramedic rescue van on Forbes.

The van apparently was not needed, as Peer Medical Aid volunteers
resported a girl with a minor head injury as the only casualty of the

night.

“It’s only 1a game. It’s only a game!” one disgruntled cafnpus
policeman said. “It seems like an awful lot of celebrating just for a

bunch of paid professionals.”
One fan disagreed.

“Only a Super Bowl victory could make something good like this

happen in Pittsburgh.” he said.

  Generics More EconomicalThan House Brands

4 By TERRI VOGT
Pitt News Staff Writer

xléising costs are forcing students
to e more selective in their food
shopping, both to save money and
supplement the cafeteria food.
Comparative shopping is a must.

The prices on 10 products
freguently used by dormitory
students were compared at two of
Oakland's largest grocery stores-
Giant Eagle and A & P.

Giant Eagle proved to be the
more economical of the two, as well
as offering generic products for

extra savings. Some of the generic ..

products are packaged in larger
quantities than brand name items.
Giant Eagle also has Food Club
products, which are comparable to
the brand name items but cost only
a few cents less.

A & P is a more spacious store,
therefore making the atmosphere
more desirable in which to shop.
This will cost the student consumer
a few more pennies, and to some, a
few more blocks of walking.

Another reason for shopping A & P

Counseling Service
Provides Help For
g Troubled Students

.-

By WILLIAM MOORHEAD
Pitt News Staffwritcr

Problems in personal life and
with schoolwork are a fact of life to
most college students. Solving
them is a difficulty, but some of the
answers could be found at the
University Counseling Center.

Under the direction of Dr. Robert
Gallagher, a professional team of
staff psychologists listen to and aid
over a thousand students a year.

Gallagher emphasized that no
problem is too insigniﬁcant to
discuss. In case of an emergency, a
counselor may be seen almost
immediately and regular appoint-
ments rarely have more than a day
or two wait. Open ﬁve days a
week, the center also offers
services to night students Monday
evenings.

Several major studies have
concluded that for every student
who utilized campus counseling
services there was another half-
dozen who expressed the need to
speak with a counselor but could
not bring themselves to go.

There are numerous reasons tor
this reluctance, and Gallagher
pointed out several.

“Most students. who come in for
counseling feel they are alone with
their concerns, that they are
something to be ashamed of,” he
said.

“Once students have had their
first counseling session and realize
that the job of the counselor is
essentially to help them ﬁnd their
own solutions or directions in life.
their fears are usually dissolved."
Gallagher explained.

Gallagher also said that some
students worry about the conﬁden-
tiality of counseling sessions. They
fear their records ar_e open to the
administration and what they say is
put on their permanent ﬁles and
could be used against them.

Gallagher was adamant in
stating that no information is ever
shared with anyone unless a very
speciﬁc request is received from
the student to share such informa-
tion.

 . i_  Some Needed

    Changes

‘When undergraduates go to the polls this week to

T elect Student Government Board member, there is

another question they must decide. The ballot also
includes a referendum that proposes a series of
changes and additions to the present student govern-
ment constitution.

The major changes that would occur if students
pass this referendum are: an increase of the number
of board members from six to eight; the change of
election day to November; the addition of part-time
students to the electorate; and the abolition of the

‘section that sets up a programming committee.

These changes are welcome ones that could make
student government more representative and more

responsive to students. Any increase in the number 1

of students on the board is certainly welcome.
We find it patently ridiculous to contend that six

~ students can represent adequately the 12,000 un-

dergraduates at Pitt. We only wish that the commit-
tee that revised the constitution would have opted for
a student senate system, which would have raised the
number of students on the board to somewhere near
20. Such a number is the only one that cantruly
represent the various factions of students here. a
The extension of the franchise to part-time stu-
dents is only fair, since thse students also pay the ac-
tivities fee. “Taxation without representation,”
should be as onerous to Pitt students as it was to the
founding fathers. . ' . . —

The change of the voting’: day to.-November also . I

could serve 'to.,increase »th,e'.acc‘ou,ntability', of student

government. ; Inthepast t\«he'pscheduli_n‘g,of elections '
in January always has ‘delayed’ the allocations‘

' 0' @112 an News

hearings until" the spring and summer mohthswhen
most students are not on campus.‘ As a result,. the
allocation—-the most important function student
government fullfills—were not under the close
scrutinyof students. Hopefully, the change in the
election date can allow the allocations hearings to be
held during the winter termso that students can watch
their government closely while it decides how the
funds from the activities fees will be spent.

One timely, but delayed, change is the deletion of
the clause in the constitution that provided for a
programming committee. Llnder that provision, the
programming commmittee had to submit a budget as

all other student government committees do and face a

an evaluation of its allocation request.

When the Pitt Union Program Council was formed
this year, this clause was apparently forgotten by the
board members when they gave the council a block
grant. This action, if it had been challenged by any
student’ group, may have been found uncon-
stitutional by the Judicial Committee of SGB.

The Constitutional Review Committee
alleviating this problem by deleting the clause about
the programming committee. Their action makes the
program council unchallengable by any student

group. Certainly, this university needs an
autonomous program council if. programming is to
succeed at Pitt. However, we only wish student
government had corrected this problem beforethey

Lobby Coordinator Questions DiMaccio ’s Politics

Drew DiMaccio should learn to
think things through before his
political interests lead him to
making unwarranted claims and
proposals. " S

Speciﬁcally, I am referring to
DiMaccio’s comment in The Pitt
News article entitled “Presidential
Candidates View the Issues, ’ ’ (Jan.
15) in which he states that in order
to cut its budget of $3,500 for 10
lobbying trips throughout the year,
(in actuality, it is $1,850 for 5
lobbying trips) the Public and
Governmental Relations Commit-.
tee of the Student Government
Board might make better use of

‘bulk mailings, adding that one or

two persons with letters from
students to their legislators sent
along with these mailings would be
just as effective as sending large
groups of students to Harrisburg.
First, may I remind Mr.
DiMaccio that there are 253
Senators and Representatives in

’ Harrisburg. How canahe possibly

propose to send one or two persons
to see some of the 136 representa-
tives scattered across the state who

are needed to approve appropria-
tions for Pitt? To reach that large
of a number, you have to go where

‘ they are—Harrisburg.

As for bulk mailing, massive
mailing campaigns of form letters

and the like rarely, if ever, pass.

through the hands of the»“secretar-
ies and on to the legislators for
whom they were inten'ded. Our
Senators and Representatives have
neither the time nor the interest to

This is the University of
Pittsburgh, in the city of Pitts-
burgh, home of . the Pittsburgh
Steelers. The Superman movie
received better coverage. Some-
body’s doing something wrong
somewhere. Superman gets a
whole page while the Steelers
share an article with the Dallas-LA

game. Maybe Chuck Noll should
draft Chris Reeves for better
publicity.

How many students do you think
are Steeler fans? We’d bet on a lot.

Finally, taking large lobbying

It is toward this end that Public and

proposal “would be just as

,A proposal was presented
recently at the Inter-Fraternity
Council endorsement meeting cal-
lingpfor a Student Government
institutional amendment guaran-
teeing the seven governance
groups 15 percent of the total
student activities fee. Under the
amendment, the governance
groups would receive approxi-
mately $40,000 next year as
opposed to $22,500 they received
this year. That represents an
increase of approximately $17,500.

If we take a closer look at the

proposal, the implications become"

clear. First, let us suppose the
amendment passes. Assuming this
year's allocations process will be
the same as last year's, approxi-
mately $261,000 of the student's
activity fee will go the the Pitt
News, Pitt Union Programming
committee. Student Government

student organizations will be able
to operate on such a minisule
The result will be
ﬁnancial ruin for some groups and
greatly decreased activities for
others. H’

Proponents of the amendment
say that additional funds may be
extracted from the programming
council’s $110,000 allocation.
Don't let anyone fool -you; the funds
allocated to the council come from a
three year contract. It is a legal
and binding contract; not one cent
can be retrieved from the budget.

It's great when students get to
decide where their money is spent
through referendum- But before
voting, students must educate
themselves on the implications of
the referendum.

It is obvious that the proposed
amendment which will be before us
soon will be costly to almost every
student. If we cannot improve the
allocations procedure, other than

though an ‘irresponsible proposal\ 0'

like the amendment, we should

' stick with what we have.

Assassins

’ Directed by William Turner

Theatre Express

“Assassins: a pair of asses
followed by their sins. A word that
repeats itself. J Just like history
repeats itself.” -

A new play by Charles Gilbert
Jr., “Assassins” is exactly what its
title suggests--—a .drama about
political assassins. This, of course,
is nothing new to - the stage,
considering, for example, “Julius
Caesar.” “Assassins,” however;
does have unique qualities.

It’s a jazz-rock musical. It has

chorus lines and chart-busting
tunes like “T-Iashish Fantasy,”
“We Can Shoot You” and “Don’t
Let the Bogeyman Make You
Blue.” The soloist and chorus are
(naturally) all assassins.

John Wilkes Booth, James Earl
Ray, Sirhan Sirhan and Lee Harvey
Oswald are all represented.
Squeaky Fromme too. But not as

themselves. “Assassins” is more
of a composite of all political
murders. It’s a melting pot of

sundry psychoses fused together
into one single, almost predes-
tined, super assassin. In the
play he’s known as G.

Barry Plumlee plays G. He's
convincing as the play’s only

realistic character. That’s not too
difficult, however, considering the
remaining characters are cast into
roles that range from camp to
surreal. But he does provide the
necessary contrast to ensure that
the play is taken seriously.

The audience witnesses the
almost inevitable conversion of G
from young drifter into political
assassin.

The target of the assasssination
plot is—well, wait until you see the
mask and mannerisms.

Various catalysts to G’s conver-
sion are shown in a series of quick
scenes that jump from past to
present.

“Assassins” is very abstract. If

you don’t understand it, it could be
because the play, according to it’s
author, “offers many explanations,
but ultimately, no explanation.”
Or, as one character sings, ‘‘you’re

‘ not high enough.” So don’t worry,

the audience is absolved from
understanding at the end of the
play by an unseen voice off stage.

The acting in “Assassins” is
good. The music is also good, but

' the songs take the cake.

The staging is almost unbear-
able. While William Turner's
three rows of metal scaffolding and
double-decked front stage provide
the unnatural juxtaposition neces-
sary to create the surreal atmos-
phere this play thrives in, it also

tends to block. the actors’ faces.

Movement is rigid, but this ‘works If“

nicely with the surrealistic theme.

Theatre Express, in their first
season in the Plaza Rubber Co.
building on Baum Boulevard,
should be commended for their
efforts. Undoubtedly, they could
do with a check the size of an
assassination payoff. Neverthe-
less, the company has put together
a production worth dealing with,
something to be questioned and
thought about, something worth
improving. “Assassins” is a new
and different play done by people
willing to try something new and
different. This, perhaps, is the
play’s best quality.

of the Firefox can release his

technological breakthrough that Teekets when he ihinks Of deing 50
threatens to ‘disrupt this delicate and he deem,‘ haVe t0 Press any
balance. DULLOIIS.

The Russian breakthrough The pilot’s thoughts are moni-

comes in the form of a Mig-31, code tored by the plane, and as soon as a

fire thought is picked up by the
plane, the missile is on its way to
the target. This idea is carried
even further, however. The pilot
can. by way of thought, control the
direction of the projectile. This
means no misses.

The western powers realize the
implications of the Firefox’s
capabilities. A fighter travelling at
Mach 5, undetected by radar and
possessing weapons capable ‘of
almost 100 percent accuracy would
make their defense systems obso-
lete and their fighters out-rrioded‘.

What is worse is, that it would
take the United States and England
twenty‘ years to develop a similar
jet because of cutbacks in military
expenditures.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Midnight Diamond

1 -Dobie Gray

Inﬁnity Records

Ten points to anyone who can
name a black country-western
singer besides Charley Pride
Hard, isn’t it? Dobie Gray is about
the closest choice, due to “Drift
Away,” his hit record of several

years ago. That and his following

 

1,
—«_:t_,

albums were recorded in Nashville.
But “Midnight Diamond,” his
latest album, offers a slightly
different formula.

Gray is backed by the latest

edition of the Muscle Shoals,

(Alabama) rhythm section (they
played on some of Aretha
Franklin’s and Herbie Mann’s best
recordings). The combination
ignites few sparks.

The opening number, “You Can
Do It,” sets the album’s sluggish

course, welding Gray’s hillbilly
vocals to a disco beat. The best
thing here is a fuzz guitar solo
played by either Larry Byrom or
Ken Bell. ‘ ‘We’ve Got To Get It On
Again” is a little better, with the
horn arrangement reminiscent of
1960’s soul, Stax-style.

“Let This Man Take Hold Of
Your Life” (where did these titles
come from?) has a stronger country
and western ﬂavor than any other
tune—there’s even a steel or a slide
guitar in the background.

Best Bets on Oakland Hoagies
APitt News Review  

By ERIC HINRICHS

It is called a sub but it doesn’t.
belong to’the Navy. It’s called a
hero but it has never done anything
to earn this prestigious title and it’s
called a torpedo but it never sank
any ship. '

What is it?

,To some it is known as the
hoagie, that Italian sandwich that

has often been the alternate to the -

hamburger and the pizza.

There are many establishments
in the Oakland area that serve the
Italian hoagie and many variations
to its theme.

Four establishments in ‘the

Oakland area that ' serve Italian
hoagies are reviewed below. A
scale of 0 to 5 is used to rate the
categories of atmosphere, sand-
wich contents, varieties offered,
and price. Five is the highest
rating possible. Zero is the lowest,
and three is average. 1

Mother John’s Pizza, 4523 Centre

1 Ave.

Atmosphere—(1)\ Order to go
should be the rule, not ‘the
exception. '

Variety—(2) With or without is
the extent of their variety.

Contents—(3) The bare mini-

mum for the price is served.
Taste—-(2) When you order a
hoagie with oil and get mayonnaise
one tends to get upset (especially if
you don’t like mayonnaise).
rPrice—(3) 2.65 with tax.
;Comment: Better places can be
found. A

’ Original Hot Dog Shop, Forbes at

Bouquet.

Atmosphere—I’ll refrain from a
rating here. Each time you walk
into the “O” you’re met with a
unique atmosphere. '

Variety,—(5) Most of their variety
is with steak sandwiches.

Contents —(4).

Taste—(4) Not bad.

Price—(5) $2.21 withytax. O

Comment: What can be said
about the “O” that hasn’t“ been
said before? For those in lower
Oakland it’s one of the best places
for hoagies. E '

Subway, 119 Oakland Ave.

'Atmosphere—--(3) ‘A place to
eat——-that’s all.

Variety—(5) Many varieties to
choose here, and quite a few ways
that your sandwich can be
prepared. ‘ A

Contents—(2) If you love bread,
the Subway is for you.

Taste—-(2) As mentioned before,
there is not much taste to bread.

Price—(2) $2.65 with tax is
deﬁnitely not your money’s worth.

Comment: The subway is a
chain franchise. Although it has

many ways to prepare your hoagie,

the quality is average, if not worse.

Gino and Pete’s, 4601 Forbes Ave.

Atmospher-e——(3) One of the few
places where it isn’t an adventure
to eat there.

Variety—-(5) They may not have
as many varieties as the “O”, but
they do have a lot more than other
places.

Contents—(4) You get your
money’s worth. '

Taste——-(5) The mozzarella
cheese on the sandwich adds a
definite ﬂavor to it.

Price——(3) $2.65 with tax.

Comment: For those in upper

want your money’s worth_—high1y

Campus Crusade

for Christ

The ﬂip side offers the two most
energizing cuts. And strangely,
they're cover versions of someone
else’s hits. First is Johnny ENash’s
“I Can See Clearly Now,” which is
highlighted by an infectious guitar
riff blending with synthesizers to
produce what can be called
“country reggae.” “Sharing the
Night Together” has an inventive
instrumental arrangement. Hear-
ing the combination of celeste,
electric piano and ARP strings
makes sitting through the rest of

,.»'/

the albu.fn worthwhile. Almost

worthwhile, that is.

The remaining songs go no-‘

where. “Who’s -Lovin’ You” and
“I’llVBe Your ‘Hold Me Tight”
(shoot the title writer!) are
insomnia cures, while “Thank You
For Tonight” should be called
“Thank You For Ending This
Record.”

If there are any Dobie Gray
fanatics out there, then “Midnight
Diamond” will be satisfactory. All
others beware.

Dobie Gray’s new album is titled “Midnight Diamond.”

1 i.

  
  
     
 
 
  

...an experience you’ll never forget!

Dramatically explores life, death . . . and beyond.

Multiple

imagery and hard-hitting music carry you beyond death into reality.
Music from Blood Sweat 84 Tears, Jim Croce, Bloodrock,
Black Sabbath and others. Don't miss it!

MlAMI——Terry Bradshaw ended his

ﬁnest National Football League season

yesterday by completing four touchdown

passes and pacing Pittsburgh to a 35-31 -

Super Bowl the Dallas
Cowboys.

The Steelers’ third professional football
championship was accomplished during an
exciting game whose fourth quarter was
perhaps its finest. Bradshaw’s offense
struck suddenly and effectively in the ﬁnal
period, producing a pair of touchdowns that
threatened to bury -the computerized
Cowboys.

But Dallas, down 35-17, used 5 pair -of

win A against

‘short Roger Staubach touchdown passes

and a recovered onside kick during the ﬁnal
few minutes to tighten the 13th game of the
Super Bowl series.

Bradshaw established a pair of passing
records while leading the Steelers to their
third professional football championship.
His 318 passing yards—high mark of his
career——shattered Bart Starr’s Super Bowl
record of 250 yards and four touchdown
tosses also set a new Super Bowl high.

Pittsburgh assumed a 21-14 halftime lead
when Bradshaw, this season's NFL most
valuable player, ‘threw a pair of scoring
passes to John Stallworth and another to
Rocky Bleier.  ~

Former Pitt All-America runner Tony

Steeler defense on three consecutive plays
during the game’s ﬁrst series,‘ but the only
touchdown Dallas’ offense cotild score ‘in
the first half came when Tony Hill ran 26
yards with Staubach’s pass to complete a
39-yard scoring play. - .

Dallas linebacker Mike Hegman raced 37
yards with a ball stripped from Bradshaw
early in the second period to score‘ Dallas’
other ﬁrst-half touchdown. '

Though Bradshaw’s battering; of a
respected Dallas defense was thorough,
Pittsburgh's four-point win, which matched
the betting line set by Las, Vegas
bookmakers, perhaps was traceable to a
play with which Dallas nearly became the

touchdown.

Dallas drove to Pittsburgh’s 10-yard linef‘

and, needing three yards from a third-down
play, Staubach huddled with Cowboy coach
Tom Landry and chose a play that found
tight end Jackie Smith open in _the end
zone. «’

Smith, a veteran offered a chance to
re-enter the NFL by the Cowboys, dropped
Staubach’s pass and Dallas was forced to
settle for Rafael Septien’s 27-yard ﬁeld
goal. .

The four points Dallas lost cost the
Cowboys a victory each team was conﬁdent
it could claim.

Landry praised his team after the loss:

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.-
There was no cause for celebration
among Pitt’s Panthers Saturday
evening, since West Virginia’s
Mountaineers had won, 93-92, a
game the Panthers could have‘
claimed. ‘ ,

But, in a change welcomed by
Tim Grgurich and his team, there
was room—even reason-——for hope

9 - after the game.‘ For though Pitt

had lost again, ‘the Panthers had
fought nobliy and_ lost not to
damning mistakes but rather by the
bounce of a basketball.

While a Mountie-maniacal crowd
of 11,187 persons ﬁlled WVU’s
Coliseum.with oft-numbing noise,
Pitt -ﬁlled 40 minutes with pressing
defense and productive offense.

Each team faced a formidable

;foe;, Pitt’s problem was a hostile

atmosphere, WVU’s the hostile’

nature of_ Pitt’s play near the
baskets. West Virginia’s perfor-
mance was disrupted by Pitt
muscle, which allowed Pitt to
control play much of the way. '

“A lot of that had to do with
Pitt’s physical prowess,” WVU
coach Gale Catlett said. “We just
couldn’t get into thelﬂow of the

» game.”

‘Pitt’s plan to intimidate WVU
was apparent, .as were "these

A Tale of Two Team’s 

Though this season has not been a fine one
for the Panthers (7-7), Tim Grgurich’s current
band has yet to see the unfortunate side of .500.
And, despite an Eastern Eight record of 1-2,
Pitt still must be counted a contender for a
league title that affords its owner entrance to
the NCAA tournament.

Iona was placed by many among the East’s
top teams before the season began. But,
despite the play of sophomore center Jeff
Ruland, the Gaels (yes, Gaels) today fall behind
a handful of Pitt opponents in performance, if
not ability. Syracuse, Temple, Rutgers, Duke
and perhaps even West Virginia hold as much
menace as Iona.

Wrestlers Fdlishort In Comeback Ed, Lose 24-17

BETHELEM. Pa.—Lehigh swept
the first five bouts Saturday and
held off a Pitt rally to defeat the
Panther wrestling team, 24-17.

The Engineers (7-5), who had
fallen from fourth to eighth place in
the national rankings after losses to
Wisconsin (ranked third) and
Cleveland State (ranked 18th),
raced to a 18-0 lead, but needed a
pin from 190-pound All-America
Mike Brown against Pitt freshman
Pat Connor to clinch a victory in
noisy Grace Hall. ,

“A match here and there
decided it,” Panther coach Dave

Despite the close loss to a
highly-ranked team in a loud

Grace Hall seats more than 2,500
people), the Panthers (3-3) be-
lieved they could have won the
match.

“We didn’t do quite as well as
we hoped to,” Adams said. “We
hoped we could win this one.

“Not that we came in here
expecting to win,” he continued.
“But we thought we could pull it
off.”

“We did all right,” Pitt assistant
coach Rande Stottlemyer said.
“But I was disappointed in some
people. We did win four of.l0

team,” Stottlemyer said. “They
were rated—it gives us a little
conﬁdence against the good teams.
Lehigh could have really knocked
our hopes of a half-decent season if
they would have blown us out.”

Crowd Out For Pitt Blood

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

BETHLEHEM, Pa.—“Ladies
and gentlemen,” the Lehigh public
address announcer told some 2,500
jeering fans in crackerbox-like
Grace Hall during the Pitt-Engi-
neers wrestling match, “Mr.
Smocharski weighs 400 pounds.”

The boos hit a crescendo when
Panther heavyweight Steve Smo-
charski, a noticeable 6-9, 400

pounds, walked onto the mat for

the ﬁnal bout during the Panthers’
24-17 loss to eighth-ranked Lehigh.
And when Bill Amelio, a 190-
pounder turned heavyweight,
walked out onto the mat to wrestle
Smocharski, the crowd jeered‘
lustily.

Already the Engineer fans-
noted for their loudness and
crudity—had let their displeasure
with Pitt be known. When the
Panthers walked onto the mat for
opening warmups, the large crowd

ooed. And when Smocharski
ﬁnished the line out of the locker

room, the decibel level rose
noticeably.

“Coach (Dave) Adams told me to
keep calm,” Smocharski said. “In
the past, I had experiences with a
hostile crowd and didn’t‘ handle it
too well.”

The crowd was_ upset as
Smocharski rolled to a 5-2» lead in
the second period. He was
infuriated when, after the referee
halted time and called each
wrestler for stalling, Smocharski
got up from atop Amelio — but
Amelio didn’t move.

“Their screaming didn’t bother
me,” Smocharski said. “I just
imagined that they were cheering
for me.”

But Lehigh fans never cheer for
the opposition—which is why
Grace Hall is feared by all visiting
teams. In fact, Grace Hall is so
noisy Pitt played a tape of a
bullﬁght crowd in its practice room
all week to grow accustomed to
loud cheering. 2

“Their crowd is definitely

devastating,” Panther 177-pound-
er Jim Gordon said. “It’s such a
closed area, and they yell obscen-
ities. They want you to fight them
instead of their team.”

“It’s hard to wrestle here,” Pitt
167-pounder Skip I Bolin agreed.
“From the quiet in our gym during
matches to the adversity here, it’s
quite a difference.”

“But the bullﬁght tape worked,”
Smocharski said. “It didn’t seem

as loud at Lehigh as it did in the

practice room. ’ ’

But it was loud——the fans didn’t
appreciate seeing their wrestler
crushed by the 400-pound Smoch-
arski. They don’t like adversity.
Just the night before, in a 26-8
Engingeers loss to second-ranked
Iowa State, the fans showed their
disgust with referee Pat Mc-
Cormick’s calls by bombarding him
with paper and coins during /the
meet. Against Smocharski, they
bombarded the new referee with
screams of “stalling!”

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Morgantown, W.Va.——About an
hour before Saturday’s basketball
game between Pitt and West
Virginia at WVU’s Coliseum, a
Mountaineer fan turned around in
his seat and yelled to anybody who

x cared to hear, “I want Sam Clancy

right now!” And so the mood was
set for a frantic, emotional, and
sometimes brilliant basketball
game involving the Eastern Eight’s
version of the Hatﬁelds and the
McCoys (with ‘pardon to Du-
quesne).

Mountaineer fans seem to have

‘ about as much, or little, respect for

Clancy as Panther fans have for

1 Robert Alexander, West Vir-
ginia’s self-proclaimed Tony Dor-
sett. Pitt’s 93-92 loss was

especially difficult to swallow
because it was a game inwhich Pitt

built leads of nine points in each.
. half.

It also hurt because the
Panthers were performing very
well with the odds stacked against

them.

Four Panthers—Wayne Wil-
liams, Carlton Neverson, Pete
Strickland and Terry Knight-
fouled out of the contest and three
others finished the game with four
personals. Knight was disquali-
ﬁed midway through the second
half, which saw the Mountaineers
enjoy the one-and-one bonus
situation for 13 minutes. But much
more of the evening was foul to
Clancy. ,

Not only did Clancy have to
protect himself from a barrage of
ice cubes and paper cups from the
stands, but he also had to avoid
being mugged underneath the
hoop during offensive efforts which
resulted in a 5-for-19 shooting
night.
Webster was_ angered by the lack of
calls against both West Virginia
and their fans.

“They should have had a
technical called on them, ” Webster
declared. “They were warned two
or three times, but nothing

-- “They're some real intimida-
tors,” Clancy said. “I got called
every name’ in the book. This
crowd was worse than Syracuse’s.
But I like the noisy crowds. Iwish
we had one like this.”

After the game, Mountaineer
Coach Gale Catlett apologized to
Tim Grgurich for the crowd’s
behavior.

Even though his team had lost
yet another in a line of heartbreak-

ing losses, Grgurich expressed his .

satisfaction with his not-too-tall
team that outrebounded yet an-
other taller opponent.

“We’re just getting a lot of
mileage out of our inside guys,” he
explained. “I just think we have to
change before the year’s out.”

A ﬁnal word about Clancy’s
encounter with WVU’s student
body. During -pre-game warmups,
one fan wondered aloud how Sam
could have a name like Clancy
without looking Irish. Slowly,
Clancy walked into the WVU
student section and gently placed
his index ﬁnger on the heckler’s
nose.

“He got real pale.” Clancy said.

In the ﬁeld events, Marie Ribik

championships and moved her
from sixth to second in the ﬁnals.

“I was very pleased with two
individuals in particular,” said

 

Goff. “Peri, and‘ Gwen were just
outstanding.” , 1

Goff was alsofpleased with the
team’s overall efforts and was glad
that the Pantherettes could exper-
ience the kind of national competi-
tion which she ‘called “some of the
best in the country.”

Many of thejsame teams that

competed at Ohio State will be in
Oakland for the Pitt Invitational
Feb. 2 and 3 at the Fitzgerald Field
House. ': 5., _

“This meet_,:, along with our
invitational, willfgivei our girls the
kind of experience they’ll need to
prepare for the,-_,Eastern champion-
ships,” Goff said.

Goff feels that the Pantherettes
will improve as the season goes on
because of the team’s youth.

“The bulk of the team is made
up of freshmen and sophomores,”
said Goff. “There are only four
seniors on the team."

Pitt's next competition will be a
home dual meet with Ohio
University on Sunday.

“This is the ﬁrst time that we’ve
competed against Ohio,” Goff
said, “and their coach says that
they don’t have much—but we can
never go by that.” \

Balthaser Has Pantherettes on Winning Track  

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Staff Writer

One week ago, after an unsuc-
cessful road trip, Pitt women’s
basketball coach Jean Balthaser
said “we are really looking forward
to coming back to our home court; a
few wins here will really help boost
our confidence.”

The Pantherettes, with a 55-52
win Saturday night against Mich-
igan State and a 79-41 victory
against Cleveland State last Wed-
nesday, have accomplished exactly
what Balthaser wanted.

‘ Pitt took early control
Michigan State, scoring

of
seven

unansweredpoints (ﬁve by Wanda
Randolph). Control stayed with
Pitt as its lead rose to as many as
nine points.

Midway through the first half the
Pitt defense began to relax and
Randolph, carrying three fouls,
was forced to sit awhile. With two
seconds remaining in the half,
Michigan State, scored, bringing
the game to within one point at the
halftime whistle.

Pitt came from the locker room
only to ﬁnd itself in trouble in the
early moments of the second half.
Two straight baskets by Michigan
State put the Pantherettes down by
three.

Momentum moved back and
forth until the teams found
themselves deadlocked at 39 with
twelve minutes remaining in/the
game. From that point the lead
stayed with the Pantherettes, who
were able to set the _pace for the
remaining minutes. '

Although fouls began to force
Pitt to play a more conservative
game, Fry“and Randolph were able
to score on fast breaks to put Pitt
ahead by ﬁve.

“We were successful in getting
the ball inside to Wanda which was
good because she was deﬁnitely a
big factor in. the game," said
Balthaser. “She did a nice job in

moving for thepbiall and the outside
began looking,for. her.

“The fact that Robin (Fry) and"
Stephanie (Stripling) each scored,
'10 points shows }how well we are

. working our inside game.” i

The Pantherettes have improved
their inside game but need to
re-establish a"‘=’_.'bal,;anced attack.
“We began as'an. outside shooting
team, then played a few games
very well balanced,” said Bal-
thaser. “Now we are working only
inside.” _

The outside_g'ame was almost
nonexistent until freshman Debbie
Murray, just off the bench, scored
a basket that put a fourth

consecutive home win in the hands
of the Pantherettes.

“Debbie only made one basket

- but the key was that she started
‘shooting,

9’

said Balthaser. “She
really helped generate the. of-
fence.”

Scoring was well-balanced within
the Pantherettes lineup, as Ran-
dolph took game scoring honors
with 17 points. Stripling and Fry
scored 10 apiece and Fry had 10
rebounds to her credit. Nanette
Gibson and Mary Day were high
scorers for Michigan State with 11
points each. - I

Bradshaw — MVP Laurels In Stperﬂowl Victory

(Continued from page 12)

“But,” he added, “today the Steelers
were better because they made more big
plays.” .

One of the biggest——a 75-yard Bradshaw
to Stallworth pass play—tied a record for
the longest Super Bowl pass play. Leg
cramps forced Stallworth to leave the game
after catching Bradshaw’s first pair of
scoring passes but Bradshaw merely
shifted his -attention toward Lynn Swann
and Theo Bell.

Swann star of Pittsburgh’s Super Bowl X
win, which also came against Dallas, leaped
and caught an 18-yard touchdown pass one
play after Dennis .Winston recovered
Dallas’ fumble of a kickoff and 19 seconds

after Franco’ Harris ran for Pittsburgh’s
fourth score.

“I thought that was the key part of the
game,” Steeler coach Chuck Noll said.
“That put it out of reach.”

Dallas’ Smith said he believed his failure

‘ to catch Staubach’s end-zone pass was jv .t

as important.

“IfI had caught the pass,” he said,“we
would have tied them 21-all and we would
have had all the momentum.

“It hit me in the hip,” he added. “The
pass was just ﬁne...l was wide open and I
just missed it. I think I slipped. It might
have been that I was over-cautious. I was
trying to use my chest.
have used my hands.”

Maybe I should A

“It was a very key play,” Landry agreed.
“Jackie was so wide open that Roger tried
to throw it soft. When Jackie tried to stoop,
his legs came out from under him."

Neither Smith’s error nor Pittsburgh’s
19-second scoring spree in the fourth
quarter satisﬁed Bradshaw.

“With 6:38 to play, the guys thought we
had it won and started celebrating,"
Bradshaw said.

“That\made me mad. I knew how
dangerous Roger could be. I could see us
getting 35 points and losing the Super
Bowl. That would have been terrible.”

Bradshaw’s 318 yards were the yield of
17 completions (of 30 attempts). Staubach
also completed 17 of 30 passes, though his
gained -228 yards.

Dorsett led runners with 96 yards (25
carries); Harris was Pittsburgh’s top
ground-gainer, picking up 68 yards with 20
carries. Swann caught seven passes and
gained 124 yards. Stallworth’s three
receptions produced 115 yards: \

Each team lost a pair of fumbles and was
intercepted once.

Dallas’ overland edge was‘ 141 yards to 66
and the Cowboys earned 20 first downs to
Pittsburgh’s 19,.
