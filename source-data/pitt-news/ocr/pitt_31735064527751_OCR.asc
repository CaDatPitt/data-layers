requires additional work. A lot of people
have the idea that recycling is going to be

Currently, Forbes Quadrangle is the

“Where there is typically one trash
container, there are now two containers
— one for trash and one for recyclables,”
Boyce said. “The way the university is

up, and on Tuesday and Thursday,
recyclables.”

SGB Crime Stop
begins trial period

By Tammy Stradley
stag Writer

Crime Stop, a new program to make Pitt a safer campus,
started its experimental period last week in Tower A and
Lothrop Hall.

The program involves captains, the floor representatives
of the Resident Student Association, acting as liaisons
between the residents and Pitt’s Department of Public
Safety.

The Department of Public Safety has agreed to make
crime-incident reports public to the floor captains, who
will get the information to the residents through meetings
or workshops conducted by the resident directors. The
students will also be responsible for keeping the
Department of Public Safety informed about unreported
crimes.

Last year, Student Government Board members Michael
Golden and Katie Malaspina came up with the idea of
Crime Stop and set up communications with Sgt. Charles
Grier in the public safety office. The program was not
implemented last year because of a lack of student
involvement.

Golden and Malaspina left the idea and posters
advertising Crime Stop behind, and current SGB member
Andrew Gould took over the program.

“Everybody seems to be very positive about our idea,”
said..Gould. “I’m excited. If people participate, I think it
can do some good.”

Crime Stop will include the Office of Residence Life,
RSA and the resident directors, who will provide the link
between the residents and public safety.

If Crime Stop is successful, it will be in all of the
dormitories by next fall.

Gould plans to expand the program into South Oakland,
with the 200 block of Oakland Avenue as the experimental
area. This will involve a different base, including the
South Oakland Citizens’ Council. Gould said it will be
more difficult to implement the off-campus program
because no formal organization, such as the RSA, exists
outside of the university housing system.

Iraq resorts to ‘environmental terrorism’

By Jeff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

Saddam Hussein has embarked
on a new wave of terrorism in the
Middle East which could have
far—reaching environmental
effects upon the entire world.

Iraqi troops opened an oil
pipeline from Kuwait directly into
the waters of the Persian Gulf.
There is no estimate of how much
oil has gone into the gulf.
Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams gave an estimate on the
number of barrels spilled, not the
number of gallons.

The military has estimated that
this oil spill is more than 15 times
larger than the Exxon Valdez
tﬁsaster in Alaska in 1989. The
slick has drifted south toward
Saudi Arabia at a rate of 13 miles
per hour, said Walter Vreeland, a
pollution expert for Bahrain. At
last report, it was 35 miles long
and 8 miles wide.»

' The allied forces attempted to
cut off the supply of oil available
to Saddam yesterday by
destroying two of the oil

manifolds which control the oil
flow. At his daily press brieﬁng in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, U.S.
General Norman Schwarzkopf
showed pictures of TV-guided
bombs homing in on the
manifolds. The results of this
attempt will not be known until
later today, when photographs
will show the depth and expanse
of the slick.

Fears of the slick catching fire
were realized Saturday when a
small portion was ignited around
an oil buoy five miles off the
coast of Kuwait. It did not appear
that the fire was spreading,.

The United States admitted to
inadvertently setting fire to the
slick yesterday in an attack on an
Iraqi patrol boat.’U.S. Navy ships

ﬁred on the patrol boat and sank ,

it, and the attack ignited the oil
on the water.

This environmental terrorism
has had a devastating effect on
the Persian Gulf. The wildlife in
and around the gulf is already
suffering horrible effects from
the oil. Experts said that the
damages suffered from the

contaminated water would be
long term, and the wildlife could
suffer irrevocable damage.

There were some concerns that
this slick could potentially affect
an allied amphibious assault
against Iraq. Gen. Tom Kelly of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that
any attack would go on if needed.

In other developments:

0 British forces said they
knocked out Iraqi Silkworm
missiles over the weekend. If this
is true, this would be the first
reference to these weapons during
the war. More crude than the
Scud that has been plaguing the
Middle East, the Silkworm has a
smaller range and less accuracy.
Silkworms were originally a threat
to reﬂagged Kuwaiti oil tankers
and their escorts during 1987.

-Two reports of dogfights (air-
to-air combat) came out over the
weekend, both as allied victories.
In the first, a Saudi F-15 shot
down two Iraqi ‘F-1 Mirages. In
the second report, two American

‘F-15s" destroyed four Iraqi MiG-

233 over Iraq. No allied casual-ties
were reported in either

confrontation.

-Iraqi television broadcast
pictures of dead women and
children killed because of heavy
bombing by the allied forces.
Allied officials do not know if the
films are authentic, as the Iraqis
have been known to use file
footage in times such as these.

-The Pentagon reported that
allied sorties (missions) numbered
over 22,000 so far in the 12-day-
old conflict It also reported 2,707
soities were flown last Friday, the
most since the bombing began.

In comparison to this number,
only 16 allied planes have been
shot down so far. This means that
for every one plane shot down,
1,375 returned safely.

-More controversy surrounds
the destruction of the Iraqi Scud
missiles. Often, when the Scuds
are hit by the Patriot missiles, the
Patriots do not hit the warheads
of the ‘Scuds. Therefore, the
warheads continue to their targets.
A total of three people were killed
over the weekend as a result of
Scud attacks: one in Tel Aviv,
Israel, and two in Riyadh.

Pitt professor studies Amazon languages

 

By J can Lewis
For The Pitt News

When the woman you love
spent most of her life in the
Amazon River region in Brazil,
you can’t help but be intrigued.

Daniel Everett, Ph.D., associate
professor and chair of the Pitt
linguistics department, credits his
wife Keren for his early interest in
the languages of the Amazon.
Until they met in San Diego, Calif.,
the area was quite foreign to him.

Keren, the . daughter of
missionaries, spent most of her
childhood in the Amazon region
and had many stories to share
with Everett.

“I learned quite a bit about the
Amazon from my wife,” said
Everett

Keren is now a graduate student
at Pitt and a research linguist at
Carnegie Mellon, where she works

‘II a speech- recognition lab.

After getting married, Everett
and his wife moved to Brazil in
1977, where they stayed for the
next 11 years. In 1980 Everett
earned his master’s degree at the
Universidade Estadual de
Campinas and in 1983 earned his
doctorate, concentrating on
phonology and the Amazonian
languages.

According to Everett, linguists
have been able to reconstruct
much of early civilization through
the roots of language.

“Sometimes it is the only

‘° evidence we have,” said Everett.

In the Amazon, structures were
built mainly out of wood and
decomposed rather quickly, so
much of the information that exists
today comes from the study of
linguistics, he said.

Everett said, “People who take
linguistics [classes] for the first
time are very surprised to find out
they are more like natura1—science
classes. There is an incredible

A amount of complex language that

even children [learn] that is
probably more complex than
anything they will ever learn again
in their lives.”

When Everett first came to Pitt
in 1988, he was appointed

assistant professor of linguistics.
Then in 1989 he was promoted
to an associate professorship with
tenure and the chair of the
linguistics department

Since that time, Everett has
been awarded a faculty research
grant from the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, a summer research grant
from the Center for Latin
American Studies and a summer
stipend from the National
Endowment for the Humanities,
all of which were designated for
the study of Amazonian
languages and entailed living in
the villages of the Amazon.

Everett, his wife and their three
children have gone to the Amazon
several times and have stayed in
villages forrup to a year at a time.

“The kids adjusted very well,"
said Everett..,“We all, except for
my youngest son, have had
malaria several times.

“Just the living conditions
without running water and just
being out in the jungle are both
nice experiences, but after a while
it gets wearing.”

Currently Everett is working
with Peter Gordon, Ph.D., of the
psychology department, to apply
for a research grant to study the
language of the Piraha, a people
located in an isolated village in
northwestern Brazil. Everett

hopes to find out how the Piraha
children acquire their language.

Piraha is one of the few
languages in the world that can
be either whistled or spoken.
Unlike the other languages of the
central Amazonian region, Piraha
has had little outside inﬂuence
from Portuguese.

Everett is ﬂuent in Portuguese
and Piraha. When teaching, he
tries to incorporate his knowledge
of the Arnazonintohis curriculum.

This term Everett is teaching
Anthropological Linguistics, and
Phonology, both upper- level
linguistics classes. He also teaches
Aspects of Language at least once
a year for beginning students who
wish to explore the field of
linguistics.

In addition to his research grants
Everett is also working on two
books. The first focuses on
theoretical‘ linguistics, and the
second is the first grammar book
that ever has been done on the
Pacaas—Novos language.

Everett became interested in
the Pacaas—Novos while giving a
series of lectures to the Brazilian
Indian Foundation in Portuguese.

After the lecture a Pacaas—Novos
Indian came up to him and talked

‘to him about her language. “I

learned quite a bit about the

Hillman Library hours will not

Recycle

only larger containers required
UL approval, according to Boyce.

Since facilities management
started recycling in January 1990,
82,604 total pounds of paper and
corrugated cardboard have been
recycled by Pitt.

In December‘ 1990 the

university saved 130 trees and
25.3 cubic yards of landfill space,
Boyce said. Other resources that
were saved were sulphur,
limestone. steam. water and

kilowatt hours.

According to Boyce, the
recycled items were determined
by the type of waste generated
most by the university.

“If you did a waste-stream audit,
anywhere from 40 percent to 60
percent of the waste from a facility
like this is paper and cardboard.
So if we do an efficient job of
removing all the paper and
corrugated cardboard, we have
actually complied with more than
what the state wants.” said Bovce.

“The idea is to eventually
customize the recycling program.
If there's a building that has a lot
of glass, fine. Try to recycle it,”
said Boyce. “But to just go through
every campus building and try to
recycle everything in the world is
unmanageable.”

In addition to recycling, facilities
management has begun saving
energy by replacing incandescent
bulbs with ﬂuorescent bulbs,
according to Boyce. Energy-
saving transformers have also
been put in ﬂuorescent light
fixtures, and the bulb wattage in
some of these fixtures has been
lowered. ’

These two measures have ben
implemented in the Law School}.
and in the Learning Research and
Development Center.

However, the cost of replacing
these items is slowing down the
process. .

“An incandescent bulb may cost
50 cents, and the ﬂuorescent
lamps we want to replace them
with cost $18. The problem is,
where do you get the money to
purchase all of those lamps?” said
Boyce.

RSC malees reserve fund a priority

 

By Maureen Dorney
Staﬁ“ Writer

The Representative Student
Council discussed a resolution
proposed to govern expenditures
from the Student Government
Board reserve fund at a meeting
on Wednesday.

RSC Chairperson Mike Golden
said the use and misuse of the
reserve fund is an important issue
forthe RSC. He said that purchases
made with the reserve fund
should be more representative of
what the students want.

Concerning the $40,000 Telefact
system, Golden said, “It was the

Quad --—

said Lavin.

“Students are primed to be
receptive to this message after all

‘he publicity recycling has
received in the last few years,”
saidjohn Conlogue of ORL. “This
recycling program is just a
continuation of what is hopefully
becoming a habit.”

According to Lavin, after the
Schenley Quad’s program is put
into effect, Lothrop Hall will be
next

most unrepresentative, backward-
ass thing I have ever seen. The
most important thing [RSC] can
do is inﬂuence the SGB."

The exact wording of the
resolution was also discussed.
Brent Saunders, SGB president,
said, “The way it is worded now
pitches one group against another
group. SGB wants to work with
the RSC, not against it."

Saunders also asked the RSC
for its views on a late-night study
area on campus that would stay
open until 2 a.m. The SGB is
looking at Hillman Library and
the William Pitt Union as
possibilities.

A grievance-procedure policy
for student groups was also
presented. The policy states that
any student groups having
problems with each other should
file a grievance report to the RSC
before trying any other avenue.

Lisa Campoli, the under-
graduate student representative
on the presidential-search
committee, presented a possibility
for the RSC to have some input in
the presidential search.

Campoli said, “RSC is the perfect
forum for undergraduate students
to make up a list of questions that
the students would like to ask a
potential candidate.”

language in just 20 minutes,” said
Everett.

Linguists are able to use
techniques to communicate when
they have no language in
common, he said.

When the Indian woman
returned to her village, she told a
missionary who had lived among
the Pacaas—Novos for 30 years
about him.

The missionary had always
wanted to write a book on the

grammar of the Pacaas—Novos
and later agreed to co—author a
book with Everett.

This summer Everett hopes to
return to the Amazon along with
Gordon to continue his study of
the Amazonian languages.

As chair of the linguistics
department, Everett plans to
strengthen the undergraduate
program since it was originally
started as a graduate program, as
well as continue the current
growth of the graduate school.

“The officials in charge told us we would not be able to
practice before the games we would be playing To make it fair,
the games in the contest were not yet released in America. These
games were only available in japan," said Heffron.

The game Shadow Dancer was the first played in the competition
and was played for five minutes. The second game to be played
was Mickey Mouse, and this game was played for 10 minutes.
Then the top 20 players progressed to the second round.

The contestants who made it to the second round played
Shadow Dancer for 10 minutes. After that game the top eight
went on to the ﬁnal round. The game played in the final round
was Joe Montana Football.

Heffron won the first game and made it to the final four. He
then lost to the student who eventually won the tournament.
Heffron came in fourth place overall.

The first-place winner was from the University of Colorado
and won an Eagle Talon jeep. The second—place winner was
from the University of Connecticut and the third-place winner
was a student from the University of Wisconsin. Heffron was
awarded $1000 for coming in fourth place. He said he plans to
use the money to pay off his school bills.

Protest

Cotuinuedﬁnm page 1

The march began at the Mall
and proceeded through to the
Ellipse in front of the White House,
where the Rev. Jesse Jackson
heavily criticized the Bush
administration.

“We have unleashed a fury.
Israel has been hit. Saudi Arabia
hit. Oil wells. are burning. Oil
slicks are threatening the ecology
of the earth. The price of oil is
going up; the price of blood is
going down," Jackson said. “All
bombing and no talk leaves us
brain—dead. The need for
negotiation grows stronger every
day.”

Jackson said the money being
used to wage a war could be put
to better use.

“Let us look at the cost of this
war. This war is costing us $600
million to a billion dollars a day.
When a ground war starts, it will
cost us two billion a day. Every
bomb we drop on Baghdad costs
one million dollars. Every school
we didn’t build, every road we
didn’t pave — 1,000 children we
did not feed," Jackson said. “Mr.
Bush, we want to go another
way; give peace a chance. We
must fill the nation with affordable
houses and education and health
care," said Jackson.

Jackson implied that the
distribution of military personnel
was unfair.

“Many of us have children in
the gulf, but there are 535
members of Congress. Only four
have children there. We pray


[ <3

I

 
 

1)“ Are you I

 

today that Congress has [not] been
swept up in politics, the White
House [notl swept up in war.
Today we feel the awful stress of
violence, chaos and danger, ” said
Jackson.

“An eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth will leave us blind, ugly,
disfigured and dead,” said
Jackson.

The march was led by veterans
and military families, followed
by Arab—Americans, religious
groups and students.

Many carried signs with
messages reading “Uncle Sam eats
his young," “Make love, fuck war,”
“Peace is patriotic. War is idiotic,”
“Nice car. How many lives to the
gallon?” “If Kuwait exported
broccoli, would we be there?”
and “Fighting for peace is like
raping for virginity.” The crowds
chanted, “Stop the bombing.
Peace now,” “What do we want?
Peace. When do we want it?
Now," and “Pull out, George. We
wish your father had.”

Speakers were also on hand
before the march. Dan Winters,
who just returned from a peace
camp involving 100 participants
on the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border,
spoke of the conditions in Iraq
since the war began.

Winters said that the Iraqi
people he met were not hostile.

“I met Iraqi women who asked
me, ‘Why does President Bush
want to kill our children? Why
does he want to kill our beautiful
children?’ I can only respond with
tears," Winters said.

Winters said he had a message
for President Bush.

“I would like to tell President
Bush that he will be the tie-
breaker. Lyndon Bainesjohnson

Winters said.

National Organization for
Women President Molly Yard
focused on the role of women in
the military and the Middle East.

“We all still have a question as
to why we are defending Saudi
Arabia, an autocratic monarchy,
a country where women have no
rights, where no citizen can vote.
This clearly is not a democratic
society. We would never have
gone to defend the apartheid

regime of South Africa. WhY are
we defending the apartheid
regime of Saudi Arabia, which
segregates women from men and
gives them no rights at all?” Yard
said.

“And what of the women who
are fighting in the gulf? EICVCII
percent of our forces there [are
women}, but guess what — the)’
are not allowed to be in combat
roles, so they don’t get combat
pay. They still can be killed in
this war where so many civilians
are dying," Yard said.

The march was heavily
attended by students from across
the country.

About 70 Pitt students attended
the march. Mike Laus, a member
of Students for Peace, comme nted
on the size of the march.

“I was awe—struck. It was
overwhelming. To see 150,000 to
200,000 people marching for the
same cause is inspiring,” Laus
said.

Chris Patterson, a student from
Kenyon College in Ohio, has
been on a hunger strike for 10
days.

“I want people to think about
and understand how serious this
is,” Patterson said.

Patterson said that one of his
friends has been on a hunger
strike for seven days and that the
anti—war movement on his
campus is just beginning. While
he opposes the war, he is not
sure what he will do in the event
of a draft.

“I don’t think I could kill another

__g

human being, but I didn’t think it I

would be fair to send someone
else and have them get killed, 1
have been doing a lot of serieus
thinking about that. It’s preny
scary stuff,” he said.

Dave Schrack, from Harrisburg,
Va., brought his three children,
all under the age of 10, to this
march so that they can see that
not everyone is for the war.

“It seems like the only thing

you hear is a very ﬁltered picture ' if I

that everyone agrees with war,

and this is a good way to show ,
my children that not everyone 0
agrees with violence and to

expose them to people who share
a common feeling of peace,” said
Schrack.

Schrack‘ was one of many

parents who brought their 2‘

children to the march.

“I disagree with the ﬁghting for I

a lot of reasons. I think marching
is a good way to get my point
across,” Sol Sword, a 10-year-$1.
from Syracuse, N.Y., said.
Several of the marchers
emphasized non-violent protest.

Bob Mullinary, a Pittsburgher .

from North Hills, went to the
march to protest the war, but he
feels that the protests must be
done differently than they were
during Vietnam.

“ You must support your troops
but end the war. This time the
peace movement has more
experience, and the marches
today are non-violent, butburning
the flag and spitting on troops is

violent,” said Mullinary, Q

‘ - Media needs more access...

For the past 12 days, the world’s attention has been
focused on the Persian Gulf, waiting for the allies’ next
move and watching to see what Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein will do next. Unfortunat_ely, the public often must

decipher conﬂicting reports from different sources.

The U.S. military has had an image complex since the

E Vietnam War. Many people saw the horrors from the front
3 line and realized the violent and bloody ramifications of
Zwar. Media coverage has been suggested as one of the

major causes of protest and rebellion in this country
during that conﬂict.

As a result, the military has severely restricted media
coverage of this war. It does not want the general
population to see what is happening.

However, the military has attempted to aid the media to
an extent. After the invasion of Grenada in 1983, the
military set up what it called a “combat-correspondence
pool,” which allowed a select group of journalists to go
in with the troops. ,

Unfortunately, even this has not worked. The first use

A of this pool came with the 1989 invasion of Panama. The

pool, which was supposed to go in with the troops, came
in after the troops had invaded.

Furthermore, the journalists were then banned from
televising any type of fighting to keep from showing the
killing of civilians. Fears of wounded Americans showing
up on American television prompted the move and made
the attempt to soothe the media an abject disaster.

The fear that the world might see the war live makes the
military antsy. The thought of bloodied American soldiers,
while having little effect on military personnel, could have
a devastating effect on public opinion.

Now the pool has a full-ﬂedged war to cover, and the

military will not allow much more than complimentary
footage and coverage. There are few pictures of action,
and what footage there is comes to the media fully 48
hours later.
,9 But the United States has no reason to restrain coverage
of a major event unless it has concrete security concerns.
If damage is inﬂicted on Iraqi outposts, then the world
wants to know. If the attacks are not going so well, then
itwould like to know that as well.

The military must maintain certain restrictions on what.
can and cannot be leaked. For example, planned troop
movements should not be printed, as this would be an

obvious security breach. Likewise, revealing the fact that

the United States plans to target Saddam or any other
target should be, and normally is, left out of reports.
The U.S. military should lose its “image complex” and

stop keeping America out in the cold about Operation
Desert Storm.

Animal rights’ groups go too far

Well, another big-game hunting
season has come, and gone, and
I’m sad to say that being a member
of the fraternity of sportsmen is
rapidly becoming more difficult,
even in a state with as long a
hunting tradition as Pennsylvania.
During the past several years, a
tiny minority of overzealous and
self-righteous people have taken
it upon itself to “save” America’s
wildlife from human contact every
autumn. For too long I've kept
silent and allowed myself and
fellow hunters to be harassed
and berated by people who have
little understanding of wildlife or
nature, despite popular belief.

Allow me to reveal some of the
favorite methods and actions
utilized by such “non—violent”
groups as the Committee to
Abolish Sport Hunting and
Friends of Animals. In the April
1990 issue of The American
Hunter, Allen Hodgkins gave a
vivid description of what non-
violent protest has come to mean
to the bunny~huggers.

In the fall of 1989 the Wing and
Shot Hunting Club in Burlington,
N.J., a private hunting club and
game preserve, was subjected to
several rather devastating acts of
harassment. One morning's hunt
was,interrupted early when
several dozen anti—hunting
demonstrators tnespassed on club
land and corralled animals out of

A   Tom   
Lester

the woods and along an access
road away from hunters. As
hunters returned to Camp, they
realized that club roads had been
sabotaged with 6-inch spikes and
bent rooﬁng nails which had been

painted brown and covered by’

leaves. During this same incident
a hunter’s dog started yelping in
pain as it found itself caught in a
steel leg-hold trap set by anti-
hunters. Nearby, a pile of dog
food laced with ground glass and
rat poison was found with a sign
above it reading, ‘‘You’ll find more
food like this throughout the club,
and if the hunting doesn’t stop,
the poison will stop your dogs.”
Boy, that shows true affection for
animals, doesn’t it?

Another facet of this
controversy which begs for
clarification involves the
accusation that the non-hunting
public is forced to pay for hunters’
whims through tax dollars. In
Pennsylvania, as in 49 other states,
all game management and hunter
services are funded completely
in two ways: 1) revenue generated
through the sale of licenses and
permits and 2) federal grants via
Pittrnan-Robertson, a 56-year-old

program which places excise
taxes on firearms and hunting-
equipment sales. These excise
taxes, totaling more than $6.5
billion since 1935, are used to
purchase game lands and initiate
wildlife projects in individual
states. Not one penny of general
funding has ever been used for
hunting.

Furthermore, many private
organizations like the Sierra Club’,
the Wildlife Society and The
Wildlife Management Institute
have devoted their resources to
educating hunters about ecology
and safety in the woods —— all
without ever receiving a dime of
public money. Perhaps anti-
hunters should remember these
facts the next time they harass
hunters on land in which they
have not invested one dime, while
those being harassed pour money
and time into the wild throughout
the year.

Clearly, while the anti—hunting
fanatics are content to use their
resources to harass, maim and
subvert state and federal
provisions against hunter
harassment, we sportsmen, the
true nature lovers, have donated

billions in money and volunteer‘

work on behalf of American
wildlife, both protected and game
species.

‘fun/e car’ resounds of Adolf Hitler

I am writing in response to the
Jan. 9 letter by Thomas Daniels,
which appeared in the
perspective section of The Pitt
News,l...l

The letter is replete with classic anti-Sernitic
accusations which can be found in such books as
Hitler's Mein Kampf Daniels makes the assessment
that “our country is in the clutches of a people (to
which people could he be referring?) whose
relentless aggrandizement and inﬂuence on social
character precedes a ruined nation abandoned like

Letters

a junk car.” This is comparable to something we
might have heard in Nazi Germany from Hitler
himself. So Danielsis putting himself in the company
of such wonderful human beings as Adolf Hitler.

I also wonder where are all the
powerful Jewish presidents and
secretaries of state that are doing
these things. Our history isn’t

exactly filled with prominent Jewish politicians.
As far as American soldiers dying for Israel's
interest while Jewish soldiers aren’t sacriﬁcing their
lives, let us look more closely. Never has Israel
asked for an American soldier to fight her wars for
her. Finally, Israel has, in fact, lost many lives after
being forced to fight five defensive wars.[...l

Panthers fail from the field and free throw line...

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

It had all the makings of a rout when it started. Then
it had the makings of a win. Then a loss. And ﬁnally,
it had all the signs of a miracle comeback.

But the Panthers suffered a crisis at the free-throw
line and shot a miserable 26 percent from the field in
the second half, allowing the Georgetown Hoyas to
leave the Civic Arena with an 83-78 victory in front of
16,683 fans.

The Panthers sunk only 31 of 45 free throws and
finished up with a 39-percent ﬁeld-goal mark. The
backcourt could not contain the Hoyas’ twin towers,
Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, as the duo
combined for 41 points, 16 rebounds, six blocked

Asst. Sports Editor

After an 83-78 victory over Pitt yesterday, the 14 feet of
basketball talent that is Georgetown’s Alonzo Mourning and
Dikembe Mutombo slowly dressed in the locker room while
scores of tape recorders and microphones jockeyed for position
over their owners’ heads. '

In the background -—- and several feet below — the rest of the
Hoyas dressed quietly and quickly, and most left the room without
so much as a whisper.

One would almost get the impression that Mourning and
Mutombo were the only players on the Georgetown team. If that
were the case, however, the Panthers would have walked away
with an easy victory yesterday.

But unfortunately for Pitt, the rules don’t allow that, and Charles

also wore the Hoya blue and gray.

Those four combined for 38 points — 24 in the second half —
but perhaps the most impressive aspect for Georgetown Coach
John Thompson is that they are all freshmen.

“lTheyl are really playing well,” said Mourning. “Our freshmen
have a lot of heart, and they never give up. They’re the real reason

Georgetown is in much the same situation as Pitt was four years
ago, when Sean Miller, Jason Matthews, Darelle Porter. and Bobby
Martin were given an early initiation into Big East play.

“l’ve said all along that [the freshman are] going to be very good
with [those] two big studs in there,” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans. “It’s
just like when we had Jerome [Lane] and Charlie [Smith]. When
Mourning was gone, it put a lot more pressure on those guys."

shots and three assists.

“When it turns into a foul-shooting contest and you
miss 14 of them, you’re not going to do real well at home,"
Pitt Coach Paul Evans said. “We just got worn down
inside and couldn’t guard either of the big kids. We [shot]
horrendously the second half, and I checked the height
of that basket twice. [The Hoyas] didn’t shoot too well on
it in the first half either.”

Maybe Evans should have hired a priest to exorcise the
cursed north-end basket instead of checking its height.
The Hoyas shot only 37 percent in the first half, while Pitt
turned around and responded with a 26-percent mark in
the second half. Next to nothing dropped in that cylinder.

Georgetown managed only three field goals and eight
total points in the first 11 minutes and three seconds of
the first half, as Pitt built up a 16-point‘ lead during that

stretch. But for the rest of the half, the Hoyas resorted
to zone fullcourt pressure and stepped up their
defensive intensity level. The strategy worked, as Pitt
committed 12 turnovers, and Georgetown capitalized
by mounting a nine-minute, 29-point stretch to hit the
locker room down 47-40 at the half.

“We don’t use a lot of zone pressure anymore at
Georgetown, but we went back to it because we were
reaching. The kids did a very good job, and it
increased their defensive intensity and carried over in
the second half,” said Georgetown Coach John
Thompson.

Their offensive intensity also increased as well.

Mutombo exploded in the second half; he and
Mourning started to slow the inside game down from

Lady Hoops cormls massive upset

By Rob Mazur
Sta_[)“Writer

The University of 3 Pittsburgh
Lady Panthers scored the biggest
upset in their history with a come-
from-behind 61-59 victory over
the nationally ranked University
of Connecticut Lady Huskies
Saturday afternoon at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

The win improved the Lady
Panthers to 6-2 in the Big East
and 11-8 overall. The team has
also won four of its past five
games. The Lady Panthers were
coming off a lackluster
performance against the St. John's
Express Wednesday night. In that
game they were out-rebounded
and fouled 22 times. They also
committed 24 turnovers, which
the Express converted into 19
points.

The Lady Huskies, 15-3 overall
(7-1 in the Big East), entered the

game with a 14-game winning
streak, ranked 18th in the nation,
undefeated and in first place in
the Big East. They were also
coming off close victories to
conference rivals Providence and
Syracuse.

However, in basketball, like
any sport, emotion has a lot to do
with the outcome. “I can’t explain
how much difference one game
can make,” said Lady Panther
Coach Kirk Bruce. “On
Wednesday, St. John's wanted to
win more than we did. I think that
we wanted it more than
Connecticut did today."

The Lady Panthers came out of
the gate cold, falling behind 5-0
and committing three fouls in the
first minute and 22 seconds. They
rebounded to take a short-lived
9-7 lead at the 15:22 mark. From
that point, the two teams traded
baskets until UConn went on a

. six-to—one run to close out the

first half with a 36-30 lead.

“We started out in a different
defense than the one that we
normally run, and it did not work.
So we switched back to what we
normally do,” said Bruce.

However, an inspired Pitt team
took to the hardwood in the
second half, tying the score at 42
with 12:37 remaining, and 48
with 8:43 to go. Then they took
the lead for good and coasted
home with a victory. Many fans
braoed themselves, remembering
the disappointing 82-80 UConn
victory in overtime lastyear, when
the Lady Panthers let a 61-55 lead
with three minutes remaining slip
away from them.

Coach Bruce cited many key
players who helped make the
surprising victory possible.

“Jill McElhinny did a super job
today,” said Bruce. “She has not
been feeling too well lately, and

Men’s tennis rolls

By Kenn Gaither
Staff Writer

A busy weekend of tennis at Pitt provided mixed results for the
men's and women's teams. The men trounced all three of their
opponents by a combined margin of 23-4. In their lone match of
the weekend, the women narrowly lost to St. Bonaventure 5-4.

The men kicked off the weekend by soundly defeating Duquesne
7-2. Despite losses by Pitt’s top two singles players, Eric Weaver
and Larry Garrard, Pitt roared back with consistent singles and
doubles victories.

St. Bonaventure was the next to go down, losing by the same
score of 7-2. Maintaining a balanced attack, Pitt lost only one
singles set and one doubles set. The men completed the weekend
sweep by pounding St. Francis 9-0. The trio of victories improved
the team’s record to 6-1.

GIANTS 20, BILLS 19

 

By Ethan Lott
For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Bulls refused to
let up despite an offensive
onslaught in the third quarter by
the Detroit Turbos. But they came
up short Saturday night, losing
25-18 in Major Indoor Lacrosse
League action at the Civic Arena.

The Bulls held close throughout
the first half and led 7-5 at the
intermission, but the Turbos
exploded out of the gates in the
third period with six straight goals.
After the Turbo run, the Bulls
were able to cut the lead to three

a several times, but,Detroit always

came up with big goals when it
needed them.

Pittsburgh knew it needed to
win this game and brought out a
tenacious defense, spearheaded
by defensive specialists Dave
Pietramala and Ron Klausner. In
last week’s 26-12 loss to Detroit,

the Bulls’ transition game was

almost non-existent.

“This week we’re going to do
what we had been doing [before
last weekl,” Pietramala said before
the game. “It’s time to go back to
basics.”

Aside from allowing a
breakaway short-handed goal,
the Bulls’ defense stood tall
against the explosive Turbos in
the first half. Leading the way
was goalie Kevin Bilger, who
saved 19 of the 24 shots he faced,
as well as chipping in an assist on
a long pass to Butch Marino for
a breakaway goal.

One of the most outstanding
achievements of the Bulls’ first
half was that they allowed only
one goal to each of the Gait
brothers, Paul and Gary. Gary’s
one first-half goal was a
spectacular 40-foot, behind- the-
back shot which froze the Bulls’
defense andiamazed the 8,391
fans. This shot proved to be a
warning of things to come, as
Gary added another behind-the-
back shot in front of the net,
scoring Detroit’s fourth goal of
the third quarter. Gary Gait
finished with six goals and two
assists. Paul finished the game
with five goals and three assists
and was named the Coors Light
game MVP for his performance.

Gary commented, “We all knew
what we were doing wrong [in
the first half] —— loose balls and

By Sharon Kerestes

The Lady Panther indoor track team
broke three school records and continued
its success against national powerhouses
Saturday at the USAir International Track
Meet in Johnson City, Tenn.

Stacy Wyzykowski won the open 5,000
meters and posted a record-setting time of
17 minutes, 20.2 seconds. Cathy Chrissos
broke Pitt’s record in the open mile in
4:551.

The two-rnile relay team of Monica

Wrestlers go 1- 3 on road trip

The Panther wrestling team
embarked on a two-day road trip
last weekend, hoping to rebound
after a tough loss to Cleveland
State Tuesday night.
Unfortunately, the team didn’t
fare much better; it won one
match and lost three.

The injury—plagued team is
having its problems getting things
together, and Coach Rande
Stottlemyer knows it.

Sean Gibbs, Chad Pines, Jeff
Kloiber and Perry Miller are all
sidelined with knee injuries.
Kloiber’s injury was serious
enough to keep the freshman
star out of the lineup during
Saturday’s match. Even though
Miller was injured, he continued

team, the women’s distance runners have
emerged as a successful and vital part of
the program.

“Our distance and middle-distance

Lewis said. “We have a real balance in

“Right now, there's no question about it

There was noooooo
douuuubt about it!!

The University of Pittsburgh
hockey club’s defense literally
handed the Carnegie Mellon
T artans their kilts Friday night
to preserve a 6-0 shutout for
defensive coach Mark Uknis.

“I am very proud of my
defense for preserving that
shutout,” said Uknis. “Their
primary goal was to preserve
the shutout, and they did just
that. They were making the

, plays in the neutral zone and
J not allowing Carnegie Mellon
to get into our end of the
zone. They were making the

Hockey clubs/9uz‘s out T omczns

breakout plays. They set every-
thing up. That game was for the
defense.”

The first period scoring stood
at 5-0. Scoring the Panthers’ fifth
goal was John Toto, with assists
going to Dave Koval and Crousey.

During the second period the
Panthers slowed down the pace
of the game yet were able to hold
the Tartans scoreless.

With three minutes remaining
in the period the Panthers netted
their sixth goal of the evening.
Scoring for the Panthers was
Koval, with assists going to Ross
and Skalosky.

“They were told speciﬁcally
that they were not to play on an
offensive [rather than] a
defensive,” said Uknis. “They

were to take the puck to the
red line. They were to dump it

line and not let lCM’sl play
develop. If we can play that
way against West Virginia,
we're going to beat them, and
we're going to take the title if
we play that way against
everybody.”

This weekend the Panthers
will be on the road. Saturday
they will travel north to
Meadville to face off against
the Gators of Allegheny
College at 4:30 p.m.

Sunday Pitt will be traveling
east to J.T. War Memorial

Continued from page 9

George Dieffenbach, head
coach of both the men's and
women's teams, singled out the
depth of the men's squad as the
key factor of the impressive wins.

“We have a deep team; from
singles [ranked] one to six, we're
relatively even, and that gives us
a big advantage,” he said.

This strong depth was obvious
in the play of Jeff Mills, John
Tegano, Terry O’Connor and
David Ginder; all four were
undefeated in singles and doubles
action.

The women, playing, a tough
St. Bonaventure team, dominated
in singles, winning four of six
sets. The Bonnies’ Julie Buerkle,
a freshman recruit, victimized Pitt
by winning her singles and
doubles sets. “She was the key.
She can really dominate when
she’s on,” Dieffenbach said.

The women ‘were unable to
win any doubles sets, which
frustrated Dieffenbach.

“One on one, we were the
stronger team; we doubled their
point production,” he said. “We
were just too tentative.”

Julie Loprinzi, Erika Devins, Jill
Cohen and Sue Bononno all
contributed singles victories,
proving Pitt does have individual
talent to win.

Despite the close loss,
Dieffenbach remains cautiously

optimistic about the women‘

finishing with a .500 or better
record. ,
The Pitt men return to action at
the Pitt Invitational on Feb. 16
and 17, and Penn State, Mercy-
hurst and the University of Buffalo
will be at the Cost Center. 
women hope to rebound for their
next match against West Virginia
University on Feb. 9, also at home.

its somewhat confused and hectic
ﬁrst—half pace. Mutombo scored
21 of his 23 points in the second
half and pulled down eight of his
nine boards in the same frame.

Brian Shorter did some serious
damage during his 32-minute
tenure, but he picked up his sixth
personal foul with 6:20 to go. He

left the floor with 24 points and

14 rebounds. In the process he’

removed what had been some
very effective inside scoring.

However, Evans wasn’t too
pleased with his offense.

“We made some bad fouls when
they were stalling the ball. We go
up 10, and we do some things out
of character on our offense, like

throw a lob over two seven-
footers, and we did some stuff
we should not be doing,” he said.
That “stuff” Pitt should not be
doing was demonstrated when
Jason Matthews grabbed an
offensive rebound and tried to
take the ball right back to the
hoop, while Mutombo and
Mourning were looming over him,

“You can’t have Sean [Miller]

got to come back out if there’s no

Despite such offensive mis-
haps, the Panthers mounted one

her leg has been bothering her,
but she did a tremendous job.”
McElhinny did not have any points
but played 15 key minutes,
gathering two offensive boards
and two steals.

“Jenine Joyce played a very
good game, too. She’s a freshman,
and this was her first start. I don’t
care who you are-— you ’re always
nervous when you make your
first start. She made some clutch
baskets for us in the second half,"
said Bruce. Joyce was named Big
East rookie of the week for her
performance in Lady Panther road
wins over Seton Hall and Boston
College last week. Against the
Lady Huskies, Joyce had eight
points, three assists, two steals
and three rebounds, two of them
on the offensive end.

Leading Pitt in both scoring
and rebounding was senior
forward Lorri Johnson with 16
points and 14 rebounds.
FollowingJohnson were Maureen

McConnell with 11 points,
including three three-point
baskets, Jonna Huemrich with 10
points, Jenine Joyce with eight,
Connie Hurt with eight, Lisa
Fessler with five and Erin Malloy

with three.

The Lady Panthers travel to
Washington, D.C., Wednesday to
take on the Georgetown Hoyas.

“Right now, we are in a tie for

. first with Providence and St.
John’s. We have a chance to win
the conference. We're at the
halfway point right now. If we
keep playing like we did today, I

think we can do it.”

Pitt returns home to face the
Providence Lady Friars next
Saturday at Fitzgerald Field House

In the Rutgers win, seven
Panthers came through with
victories. Sella, Sean Moffit, Mike
Michalec, Steve Budman,
Johnson, llovan and Miller all
won their matches.

“Sella has been hurt, but he
came in and wrestled really well
for us this weekend,” said

Stottlemyer. “Also, Stevie Budman
came through for us again.”

Finally, in Pitt’s loss to F&M,
Budman, Hovan, Miller and Joe
Hilferty each won their matches.
Hilferty, coming into his match
with a 0-4 record, wrestled
extremely well and beat his
opponent, who was 16-] this
year, '5-5.

Pitt's next match is on Saturday,
