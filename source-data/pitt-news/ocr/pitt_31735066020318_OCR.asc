Pitt may test new drugtocombatA|zheimer’s

By Matt Assad

For The Pitt News

The head of Alzheimer's dis-
ease research at the University of
Pittsburgh said last week that he
has applied to the Food and Drug
Administration to test the first ex-
perimental drug effective for

"treating Alzheimer's patients.

Dr. Francois-Boller, director of
the project at the Pitt School of
Medicine, said that though only
10 centers nationally will have
accessto the drug; he is confident

Pittlwill be among them.
.’’I have spoken to the head of

A the FDA, and we‘ have no written

permissionyet, but I‘ have a ver-
bal agreement/’.said Boller. ”Pitt
will have access to the drug.”

During initial testing, the ex-_
perimental drug Tetrahydroami-
hoacridine has enabled some
Alzheimer’s patients to resume
such tasks as playing golf, doing
household chores and working
part-time.

Early tests indicate that THA is
effective, but Boller, though op-

timistic, is also cautious.

”The drug is not a cure; it only
relieves certain symptoms," said
Boller. ”The tests have been very
small scale. We are sure that THA
is safe, but its effectiveness has
not really been proven. Many
more tests are needed.”

About five million Americans
have Alzheimer's disease. It is a
progressive disease that irreversi-
bly des_t_roys brain cells and can
cause symptoms such as forget-
ting even simpledetails, confu-
sion, inability to speak clearly

Freeman callsfor more  
federal student financial aid

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

If Secretary of Education Wil-.

liam J. Bennett has his way, stu-
dents attending college will find
it increasingly hard to receive
financial aid from the govern-
ment.

Bennett has for the past three
years been proposing a cutback
in the student aid and loan pro-
gram. His proposals have con-
tinually met with disapproval
from Congress as well as from
officials in higher education.

Now, Congress has approved
an experimental five-year pro-
gram, the lncome Contingent

Loan, Plan, calling for $5 million-

annually to be distributed among
10 schools‘. This plan enables
these schools to offer non-
subsidized loans which require
students. to pay the interest on
their loans while they are’ in
school.

Bennett said he will ask Con-
gress to expand the program.

Last week, Bennett said that in-
creasing college costs have made
reform of the Federal Student Aid
Program absolutely necessary,
according to The New York
Times. _

University of Pittsburgh execu-
tive vice president Jack Freeman
does not agree with many of Ben-
nett’s theories or proposals.

Freeman said that Bennett's al-

legations that college reliance on
federal assistance is a factor in the
increasing costs of higher educa-

‘ tion is ”foolishness.”

According to Freeman, reduc-

' tions in the federal aid will drasti-

cally affect students. ”But it will
not have any significant impact
on the cost of education unless
we are willing to provide either
less education or less of a variety
to students,” he added.

Bennett's new plan would
charge interest on loans at the
treasury bill-rate, plus 3 percent.
Currently, loan plans do not
charge students interest. while
they are still in school.

LOS ANGELES —— Desi Arnaz,
‘ the Cuban-born entertainer who
teamed with a red-headed come-
dian named Lucille Ball to be-
come one of the giants of an
infant television ‘industry, died
early Tuesday of lung cancer. He
was 69.
Arnaz died at his Del Mar
r_ home in San Diego County at
12:05 a.m. with daughter Lucie
Arnaz Luckinbill at his side, ac-
cording to publicist Charlie
Pomerantz.

His doctor, Charles Campbell,
said Arnaz had been ill for about
a year or so.

”He died of lung cancer. It was
from smoking those Cuban cigars
-— that's the truth,” Campbell
said.

- Reports that Arnaz was serious-
ly ill had circulated since 1981,
when he was hospitalized for
what his wife, Edie, said was a
flareup of diverticulitis, an inflam-
mation of the intestinal tract for
which he had four operations in
1969 and 1970. The reports had
intensified in recent months, but
Arnaz refused comment.

 
 

Arnaz was best known to
hundreds of millions ofTV view-
ers worldwide as the long-
suffering Ricky Ricardo, husband
of the wacky Lucy on I Love Lucy,
one of television's most beloved
and longest—running shows.

Off-screen, the couple married
within six months of their meet-
ing in 1940. They had two chil-
dren, Lucie and Desi Jr., both of
whom became actors. But the
marriage floundered, and the
couple divorced in 1960.

Beukes said the passenger train

Both trains had been heading

Loan and the Guaranteed Student
Loan allow for a fixed interest
during the 10-year repayment
period that students are given

upon graduation.

Bennett has said that college
costs have risen 36 percent faster
than the rate of inflation.

”The heart of the matter,” Ben-
nett said, according to The New
York Times, ”is that colleges raise
costs because they can. And a
very important factor in that abil-
ity to raise costs has been the
availability of the federal student
aid in the current form.”

”The notion that we will sit
back and say, ’7Well, how much
will the federal government give
us,’. and then base our costs and
tuition rates on these assumptions
is ridiculous,” said Freeman.

”Some state-owned institu-
tions, not in Pennsylvania but in
some states, have a state policy
of the low student tuition, and so
they provide a quality increase
primarily in the form of direct ap-
propriation. -

”In other states, the state bears
a substantial share of the cost;
then it's generally a state policy
that a student should bear a larg-
er share of the cost. But these
states, such as Pennsylvania, also
provide through [other] programs
a secondary source of loans and
grants.”

Charles Saunders, vice presi-
dent for governmental relations at
the American Council on Educa-
tion, which represents all higher

education, also disagrees with
many of Bennett's remarks.

”Mr. Bennett's proposals are
nothing new,” said Saunders.
”He’s been sending them to Con-
gress every year, and they've
been rejected every time.”

Saunders also disagreed with
Bennett's reasoning that colleges
permit costs to rise because they
rely on students receiving money
through federal aid‘ and loans.

‘ 

Our education sys-
temgnow is the envy of
the world, and that's
how it should be left.

V — lack Freeman
”Quite the reverse is true,” said
Saunders. ”One of the reasons
colleges need more money is be-

cause they are getting a decrease
in financial aid.”

Saunders said that Bennett's»

proposal (to expand on the five-
year program) cannot be taken
seriously right now.

”We [the ACE] supported the ~
demonstration project to see how
it works,” said Saunders. ”But no
action can be taken by Congress
until there are some results.”

Freeman.said that Bennett has
shown himself to be notvery well
informed about a lot of aspects in
the higher education community.

”This is the same man who,

. when he came into office a few

years ago, said that we are, in
reducing students loans, only
eliminating students’ time on the
Florida beaches with their new
cars and stereos. His mindset ob-
viously hasn’t changed.”

Freeman said that universities
are driven in a market situation
and are forced to pay market
prices, especially when they need
to keep up with other top univer-
sities in areas such as research.

Regarding Bennett's statement
that college costs have risen 36
percent faster than the rate of in-
flation, Freeman said that many
things universities have bought
have gone up more than the rate
of inflation. This includes items
such as , computers, software,
books and computer paper.

”With university salaries, we
[at Pitt] have been trying to get in
a catch-up position. For 10 years,
university salaries lagged well be-
hind the increase in comparable
professions.

”Universities have also had to
gear up over the last years be-
cause of higher technology,” said
Freeman. ”We at this university
have had to spend enormous
sums of money.” -

’’It comes down to a question
of how much do we want to bur-
den the next generation of stu-
dents,” said Freeman. ”Sensib|e
young people will have to weigh
the decision heavily on whether
it's worth it or not to go to
college.

Reagan vows to

make all arms deal  

information public  

By Jim Drinkard

AP Writer '

WASHINGTON +— The ad-
ministration moved today to seek
appointment of an independent
council to probe the diversion of
Iranian arms sales profits to
Nicaraguan rebels, and President
Reagan said anew that all facts
surrounding the growing furor
would be made public.

In a fast—moving sequence of
events with pressure mounting
for further explanations of the

-diversion profits, and amid fresh

calls for resignations of top ad-
ministration officials, Reagan also
announced he has named Frank
Carlucci, a former high-‘ranking
official of the Pentagon and CIA,
as his new national security
adviser.

In a midday, televised speec_h
from the Oval Office, Reagan
said an administration review had
turned up ”reasonable grounds”
to seek appointment of an in-
dependent council.

He said he had directed Attor-
ny General Edwin Meese III to
make such an application, and
moments later, Meese said at a
news conference, ”We are
proceeding to make that appli-

cation.” A

Reagan said in his speech that,
”no area will be immune from
review.”

Earlier today, Senator Richard.
Lugar, R-Ind., outgoing chairman_

of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, demanded the resig-

nations of White House chief of O. A

staff Donald T. Regan and CIA
Director William Casey to revive
a foreign‘ policy ”crippled” by
covert U.S. arms sales to Iran.

Meese, citing the law which
provides for establishment of in-
dependent council, said he was
”not at liberty to discuss the
specific grounds for the applica-
tion, the statutes that may have
been violated” or the individuals
involved.

Carlucci will succeed Vice Ad-

ministrator John Poindexter, who V
resigned a week ago when it was _

first disclosed that profits from the
secret arms sale to Iran had been
diverted to the Contras.

In his speech, Reagan repeated
that he would do his utmost to
provide all the facts from the
widening probe into the Iranian-
Contra connection.

”If illegal acts were under-
taken, those who did so will be

brought to justice,” Reagan said.

Liquor Control Board
should be phased out

It is a fact of life on college campuses that legal restrictions
on the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages do not real-
ly have much effect upon the sale and consumption of alco-
holic beverages. In other words, if a student under the age of
21 has the inclination to drink, the fact that he is prohibited

. by law to do so is not going to stop him.

As for regulating the consumption of alcohol by minors, the
Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has been a largely ineffec-
tive institution, if for no other reason than that the consump-
tion of alcohol by minors is next to impossible to. regulate.-

As with any other law, the responsibility to enforce the drink-
ing age lies with the police. The existence of a separate body
to enforce the drinking age is unnecessary and ineffective.

In his statement before the State House, Democrat James Man-
derino said that if the current system is old and archaic, it is
fine with him, for it forces potential consumers of alcohol away
from the stores through its lack of quality service.

So the argument for continuing the existence of the PLCB —

is that it deters potential consumers of alcohol. As anycollege
freshman knows, the PLCB simply isn't a deterrent.

Thus, Governor Thornburgh’s‘ plan to phase out the PLCB
is a logical response to an institution that cannot accomplish
that which it exists to accomplish.

We live in a society of free enterprise. The fear seems to be
that if alcohol is given over to this system, it will be the ruin
of the residents of this state.

Those opposing the phase-out_either do not trust the system
or are simply hoping to keep their own system for the sake of
lobbyists and those few who gain from the existence of the
PLCB.

The United States was founded upon a system of free enter-
prise. It is time to entrust the sale of alcohol to this system and

to trust the people of Pennsylvania to deal with the system with '

responsibility and respect.

Christmas, what can we say

It seems to be the obligation of
every newspaper to say some-

I guess we could talk about vi-

doubt there would be an uproar
about the use of the word fairy.

We could say something about
the birth of Christ, the actual

. cording to certain religious

*I_

From the outsidelooking in on Springsteen mania

My brother was on the phone.
’’I got it," he said, excitement in
his voice.

I knew exactly what he was
talking about, but I decided to hu-
mor him.

''I went to the record store be-
fore work this morning," he said.
"They said they didn't have it in
yet. I asked them if they would
take a deposit for it. It turned out
that they already had pre—printed
slips to take depo_sits, with
Bruce's picture on the slips. So
they took my deposit money.”

And?

"They said that they usually got
their shipments in around noon.
So I went back at 2 o'clock — but
the shipment hadn’t- arrived yet.
I was really depressed. But then,
when I went . back after work,
they had it!"

What we are talking about’
here, of course, is the new five- '

record "live" set of Bruce Spring—
steen music, spanning the years
from 1975 to 1985. The boxed
set sold more than 1 million units
on Monday Nov. 10, its first day

Reagan playing games with missiles and

A few days ago_, the United
States officially and openly
breached the SALT II nuclear
arms limitation agreement. After
the disaster at Reykjavik, the for-
eign policy fiascos of the Hasen-
fus affair and the Iran-Contra
connection, one might‘ have
thought that the administration
would learn a little caution. But
no — it decided to go ahead and
break the only agreement in ex-
istence that places numerical
limits on the nuclear arsenals of
the superpowers. It has reckless-
ly raised the stakes as if it were

playing a poker game where the.

stakes are counted in warheads
and the debts-are paid in human
annihilation. ‘'

The violation took place with
the deployment of the 131st
bomber carrying cruise_ missiles
on Nov. 29. SALT II imposed an
overall limit of 1,320 on multiple
warhead missiles and cruise-
carrying bombers. By breaking
this limit, the United States has
opened the way to unrestrained

V Q. During courtship and early
marriage‘! easily matched my
husband in desire, and I climaxed
easily and quickly. I knew I was
lucky. But after my first child my
desire for sex was gone. It came
back during my second pregnan-
cy but departed again after the
birth of our second child. I know
my husband misses that mar-
velous lovemaking we used to
have. I used to joke with him
about not having to coax or woo
me or go in for foreplay, which
waslucky because he is not good

at it! We are together almost all

the time now — he has been out
of work for 18 months. Could

that have something to do with»

my lack of desire?

A. A change in anyone’s level
of sexual appetite is to be expect-
ed at some time or other. There
‘are seasons and off-seasons. I
would be much more concerned
if you did not know what desire

and gratification ‘are; as it is,‘

please let me suggest that you
recall your high-tide periods af-

don't let yourself thinkvthat the

of release.

"My friend Chuckles Wein-
stein-called me from New York,”
my brother said. "He said he had
looked all over town for it and
that he couldn't find it anywhere.
He said that Tower Records got
two truckloads of the album and
that they were sold out as soon
as the records could be unload-
ed from the trucks."

Stories like that are front—page
news all over America. On
release-day, Monday, by the time
Bruce Springsteen got out of bed,
he already had made more
money that day than most ‘people
dream of making‘ in a hundred
luck-laden lifetimes.

I am no stranger to the Spring—
steen phenomenon. My brother
has been telling me about Spring-
steen since I973, when he first

saw Springsteen as the opening‘

act of a I5-band rock festival in
Athens, Ohio. Over the years,
every superlative that can be used
about a performer has been used
about Springsteen.

But I have a terrible confession

growth in the numbers of nuclear
warheads deployed._ For now,
neither side has any incentive
basedon mutual agreement to
stick to any of the various limits
and sub—limits imposed by SALT
II.

The administration's only,

justification for this move is that
it constitutes a response to prior
Soviet, violations of the same
treaty. But just what are these al-

legations? They allege also that I

the Soviets have introduced a
new heavy missile, the SS-25,
and that they are encrypting their
telemetry. We should examine
these allegations carefully, since
they carry the full brunt of the ad-
ministration’s justification of the
latest threat to world peace.
First, examine‘the allegation
that the Soviets encrypt their
telemetry. Telemetry refers to the
signals that a missile sends back
during.test flights so that perfor-
mance can be monitored. One
side can listen in to another’s
telemetry and determine crucial

After birth a woman is likely to
need rest and find herself preoc-
cupied. Once in a while a rela-
tive or friend has to say, "I’ll look
after the baby. You and your hus-

band go out and give yourselves ‘

a break‘— a meal, a show, a
drive. Let yourselves absorb some
of life's abundant pleasures.”

Don't nagyourself about not
feeling sexy just now. If you think
your "husband is missing some-
thing, you can give him pleasure
without taking full part in it
yourself.

But don't imagine that he is
feeling more deprived than he
says he is. Instead, think of this
as a time for learning more about

. each other, for mutual tenderness

more than for full sexual
abandon. ' r

This may be a time for both of
you to learn more about those
low-key intimacies and pleasures
that people use as foreplay and
afterplay. I don't mean specifical-
ly sexual or physical things, but
words, music, quiet companion-
ship -as well. What we call
wooing.

wrong. So many millions of
bright music fans could not love

special about him. But I have al- .

ways missed out on it.

characteristics of the missile’s de-
sign. To counter this, it is possi-
ble to code, or encrypt, the
signals. SALT II discourages this
process so that there can be verifi-
cation of compliance with the
treaty.‘ More specifically, it-for-
bids any encryption which im-
pedes verification of the treaty.
The United States‘ claims that the
Soviets have been violating this
provision.

Second, the SS-25. SALT II al-
lowed each side to develop only
one new type of intercontinental
ballistic missile. The United
States claims that the SS-25 is in
fact the second new type of ICBM
introduced since the signing of
SALT II.’ The Soviets counter that
the SS-25 is only a_modified ver-
sion of an old missile, the SS-I 3.

need quieter pleasure and com-
forting, and every woman is en-
titled to that. It is no disgrace not
to be turned on high all your life.
If your husband is out of work, at
a time. of change in his life, he too
needs distraction and petting and
sweetness from you. Anxiety and

. depression lower a man's appe-

tite as well as a woman's.

to learn more about mutual woo-
ing and encouragement" ‘ — not
just for sexual arousal, but:for.the..

I grew up on rock ’n' roll, and
there have been performers in re-
cent years whose music has
seemed fresh and exciting to me.
Thy’re not performers who get a

lot of respect or a lot of main- ,

stream press attention — they're
people like Loverboy, Bryan
Adams, and Robert Palmer.

Springsteen, though, has been
transformed into St. Bruce, and
I'm still puzzled by this. I suppose
one of the reasons is that I have
never seen him perform live,
Bruce addicts will tell you that
the live performances are where
the transcendent thrills come
through. I've listened to Spring-
steen on the radio, though, and
whena song of his comes on I
will generally switch to another
station. ’

I must repeat: This is probably
my fault, not Springsteen's. Earli-
er this year I wrote a column
about Bob Seger, in which I said
that Seger’s music was a far more
genuine expression of heartland
loveand despair than Spring-

steen's. You'd figure that even if

ajmissile is new or just an old
missile in new clothes? SALT it-
self specifies that a missile will
count as new if its throw-weight
is more than 5 percent greater
than that of the old missile.
Throw-weight is the total weight
that a missile carries, sort of like
the cargo of a ship.

The United States alleges that
the throw-weight of the SS-25 is
slightly more than 5 percent
greater than that of the SS-I 3. But
the only way the United States
could have determined this is by
listening in on Soviet telemetry.
Hence, there is a contradication
at the heart of the U.S. allega-
tions. The Soviets must not be en-
crypting their telemetry in a way
that impedes verification — if
they are, the United States could
not know that the SS-25 is a new
missile. At least one of the alle-
gations must be a lie.

All this shoots to pieces the ad-
ministration's justification for its
most recent escalation of the
arms race. This episode is at least

Constant companionship causing her lack

Q. I was diagnosed as having
herpes, and since that first out-
break I have never had another,
but I feel rejected by society. I am
a beautiful person, but I'm hold-
ing myself back. I think of myself
as unhealthy because people use
terrible words like "infectious
disease."

A. I know some beautiful peo-
ple who have herpes and who
have learned how to live with it,
including forming new emotion-
al and sexual partnerships —-—
while obeying the rule of never
having sex with anyone without
saying beforehand, at some point,
"Before we are physically inti-

.mate, you have to know that I

have herpes." People can learn
to give each other the gift of phys-
ical love while avoiding further
infection, but they have to learn
first some rules to follow —— from
a doctor or clinic.

Herpes, as I have often said on
TV and radio, is not the end of
life. At the time of the big herpes
scare, there were some exagger-
ated».stori_es publishedabout this

‘Springsteen fans hated my opin-

ion, there would be one person
who would love it — Seger, right?

Wrong. Seger told The
Washington Post that he wished
I hadn't written those things. He
said I was being unfair to Bruce.

Over the years I have received
the most passionate mail from
Springsteen lovers. One woman
wrote a letter last year that I can't

even totally describe to you here. '

It concerned putting Spring-
steen's song, "I'm on Fire," on

her stereo turntable, turning the-;

volume up, and then doing cer-
tain things with her legs and -the

stereo speakers. I've never read a-

letter quite like it, and it spoke
volumes about the devotion of
Springsteen fans.

But I am still in a quandary. I
truly wonder if I'm the only per-

son — not a person who never’

liked rock 'n' roll,.but a person
who is a true rock ’n’ roll fan —
who is mystified by theappeal of
Springsteen. I suspect I am.

But just out of curiosity -— is
there anyone else out there?

For those of us growing up
during the rise and fall of the
drug culture, scenes from
shows like The Mod Squad
can be rather humorous. The
show often dealt with drugs
and the strange lives of those

" who used them.

The cops in other shows
were always very straight-laced
and condescending toward the
users because they knew the
kids would eventually grow
out of this stage of experimen-
tation and confusion — or they
would die from the ex-

sperience.

The fashion of those who
flashed on our screens was al-
ways anti-society —— strange de-
signs on their shirts and greasy
long hair. There would be
things like ”Flower Power”
printed in some awful-looking,
overblown lettering. Some-
where on the shirt would be a

drawing of a daisy. I don't
know what the big deal with
flowers was, or why the daisy
was the flower of choice, but
that's what I remember seeing.

Today we have shows like
Miami Vice and movies like
Scarface to show us where this
stuff is coming from. The drug
scene has changed from one of
distant experimentation to a
study in quality. It is not a
matter of getting chemicals and
seeing what they will do to
you anymore. Today, the drug-
user's concern is quality.

High Times magazine arose
from the advent of the drug
culture. Once a magazine
about the experience of drugs,
it has become the source for

information on what the quali— -

cus is still on marijuana. But
the focus has changed from
the people who use the drug
to the drug itself. Take for in-
stance the letters sent to ”Dr.
Ed.” Ed Rosenthal offers advice
in each issue in Ask Ed .

For instance:

Dear Ed,

A good friend turned me on
to a few Humboldt County
buds. I found six seeds in the
smoke. lfm moving to Arizona.
How would the seeds grow
with the differences in soil, cli-
mate and elevation?

Thanks,
Tom
Rialto, CA

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, December 3, l986

Rosenthal proceeds to offer ad-
vice, saying the soil can be ”ad-
justed to meet the fertility needs
of the plant,” and ”the change in
elevation should have little effect
upon the plants,” among other
botanical things.

Though the focus of the maga-
zine has changed, there is still
much of the old language stick-
ing with the culture.

So what does all this mean? Is
it good, bad or not even worth
discussing?

Some say the change has come -

with the advent of yuppiedom.
The fad that once made young ur-
ban professionals material for na-
tional magazine covers has died,
but many of the traits associated
with it remain.

One of those was a desire for
the best of everything. This desire

Mod Squad isn't on anymore

has stuck in many areas, and one
seems to be the drug culture.

The situation is not good in
terms of what Nancy Reagan
wants to see. Were things the
way she would like to see them,

there would be no drugs at all. ’

But.drugs have become a part of ‘

the culture, no longer separate as
they once were.

The change in the attitude
about drugs by users has brought
better things. There was a time
when drugs were used with no
thought. Many are now thinking
about what they are using.

Drugs can be a bad thing. If
they are used intelligently the
harm can be reduced. Ed Rosen-
thal and High Times seem to
have grasped that. As long as
drugs are a part of life, I'm going
to relax a little and take comfort
in that too. '

Pitt's Gay and Lesbian Alliance keeps a low profile

it

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

There is an organization at Pitt
of which many students are prob-
ably not aware. It's not because
they are an inactive group. They
go about their business much like
any other organization. They're
not looking for attention. They
don't want to make waves.

And so far they haven't, ac-
cording to their adviser, John
Marks. The organization is the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

"Gay is a much more accepta-
ble word,” said Marks, explain-
ing that newspapers that use the

terms gay and lesbian are consi— .
.- dered more sympathetic to the

community than those like The
New York Times that use the
word homosexual.

"I’ve been out for 10 years
now,” Marks said. ”i don't bring
up the fact that I'm gay unless it
has relevance. What bothers me

savings!

most is if someone who knows
I'm gay doesn't give me a chance.
If you want to hate me because
of my personality, that's OK.”

Marks countered thebelief that
you can identify a gay person just
by looking at'him or observing
his mannerisms.

"It would blow some people's

minds if they knew who was «
_ gay," he said. ’’I would say that

someone who has a predisposed

l idea is very bigoted. I assure you
- they can't tell. They may think

they can spot a gay [person], but
they can't.” _

Although many heterosexuals
reassure themselves and others of
their sexual orientation with so-
cial devices such as books claim-

ing that ’'real men don't eat,

quiche” and belts that read "boy-
toy," Marks said he doesn't make
a point of proclaiming that he is

Marks said that through the
positive effoits of Hollywood
celebrities like Rock Hudson,
people are realizing that gay peo-
ple come from all walks of life
and that the deadly disease AIDS
could strike virtually anyone.

The blame for the spread of the
AIDS virus has fallen on the gay
community it seems, but Marks
said he doesn't think_anyone is to
blame for the outbreak.

"No, it's not our fault AIDS is '

predominantly in the gay com-
munity," he said. ”We are being
unjustly blamed. It's not our fault
we have this disease. Certainly
some members of the gay com-
munity are more promiscuous. If
you're a gay or a straight man,
you have the same view of sexu-
ality. Men are socialized differ-
ently than women. Gay men are
socialized the same way straight
men are." '

”Things are male oriented."

Jay said that gay males are
more accepted than their female
counterparts.

”lt’s almost always going to be
easier for men than women," lay
said, adding that the stereotype
for gay men has been broken,

while gay women still face ‘the g

stereotype.

’'If you wear a tie, you're ex-'

pected to be gay if you're a wom-

an,” Jay said.

Jay estimated that more than
half of the gay population at Pitt
is closeted, which could be at-
tributed to misconceptions and
the threat of social consequences
such as the loss of friends. _

”It's easy to be deluded about
how gay women feel and about
their lifestyle,” she said. "The
easiest way to get to know them
is to treat them like ordinary

people."

sees the admissions process
that admits about 3,000 new
students each year to the uni-

tribution of some $40 million
' in financial assistance to Pitt
students.

Prior to joining the Pitt ad-
missions staff in 1978, Porter
was associate director of adm-
missions at Duquesne Univer-
sity.

She earned her Ph.D. in

‘ higher education administra-
tion at Pitt in 1984, a master's
degree at Duquesne Univer-
sity in 1970 and.a bacheI_or's '
degree in elementary educa-

-$700 million buyoutmay shake up GM 

_\

By Janet Braunstein
AP Auto Writer

0 DETROIT — A $700 million
buy-out may mean that billion-
aire H. Ross Perot is off General
Motors Corp.-’s board of directors,
but his feud with the automaker
and its chairman probably is not
over, an industry analyst said.
Perot resigned Monday as
chairman and chief executive
officer of Electronic Data Systems

Corp., which he -founded with
$1,000 in 1962 and sold to GM

in 1984 for $2.5 billion. Three of

his top executives also agreed to
leave in return for a total of $50
million.

Perot had been GM’s largest in-
dividual shareholder. He had
blasted the nation's largest car-
maker as top—heavy and slow-
moving and said GM’s manage-
ment was out of touch with its
workers. He had recommended

eliminating executive parking
and dining rooms.

GM Chairman Roger Smith
responded last week by calling
Perot impatient and saying he ”is
not very familiar in total with our
business.” Smith said Perot’s
office at EDS in Dallas ”makes
mine look like Shantytown.”

GM directors voted Monday at
a meeting in New York to buy out
the 12‘mi|lion shares held by
Perot and the three EDS exectives

Student Government Board
member Rob Ardizzi will hold
an orientation meeting tomor-
row evening for his proposed
student escort service.

In response to the increase
in violence in Oakland earlier
this year, Ardizzi proposed
that Pitt adopt a student escort
p_olicy similar to those of many

urban schools nationwide.

As the first step in his

Meeting to be held tonight for
proposed student escort service

project, Ardizzi is hoping to
recruit volunteers to work with
the service as either dispatch-
ers or escorts.

The main purpose of tomor— _
row’s meeting, according to
Ardizzi, is to find out exactly
who is interested. Once the in-
terest factor is determined,
Ardizzi will decide upon a

. starting date for the service.

”Depending on the number
of students that show and their
enthusiasm [for] the project,
the service could begin right
away or maybe the first of
January,” Ardizzi said.

Any students interested in
becoming an escort should at-
tend tomorrow's meeting at 7
p.m. outside the SGB office on
the sixth floorof the William
Pitt Union.

Abandon All Hope Ye Who
EnterHere. .

This message is not posted
above the entrance to Fitzgerald
Field House, but visiting teams
on'the Pitt Panthers basketball
schedule are forewarned to enter
at their own considerable risk. In-
side lurk Sandman and Rome and
Mr. Fluid and Silk and Goody.
You may know them better as
Demetreus Gore, Jerome Lane,
Charles Smith, Curtis Aiken and
Mike Goodson. They not only
possess exceptional talents, but
also a new head coach from the
U.S. Naval Academy who won't
be content until his charges sub-
merge all others in the Big East
conference.

It's pretty easy to get carried
away when writing about this
team. Four former high school
A|l—Americans grace the starting
lineup. Coach Paul Evans was
Commander of Roundball Oper-
ations at Navy last season and
directed the Midshipmen to with-

’_ in a game of the final. four. A strict

disciplinarian, Evans seems to
have plugged his philosophies

_ into the Pitt basketball program

without much static.

"They're responding pretty
well,” said Evans. "They're still
doing some things I'd rather not
have them do. They're not real
comfortable with the system yet,
but I like coaching them. I think

they're a great bunch of kids.” '

From Evans, one can expect the
following: toughness, grittiness,
precision. And basic, textbook
basketball. Nothing fancy here.

strategies that I am known ,for. My

confidence, like the breezes that

power him through choppy
waters,_can propel a marginal
player and an average team to
greatness.
It seems fitting that Evans
would rise to prominence as
head coach of the U.S. Naval
Academy, where he led a group
of future ensigns to the final eight
of last.season’s NCAA tourna-
ment. Tom Pope, the head coach

at Geneseo State College who
hired Evans as a freshman’ coach
in 1969, said of Navy's 30-5
record and three tournament
wins: "You couldn't believe how
confident they were. I mean, they

* weren't that good of a team."

- Similar words describe Evans’
teams at Geneseo and later at St.
Lawrence College in Canton,
New York, where he became the
winningest coach (126-50) in the
school's history. Jim Berkman,
now the head coach at St.
Lawrence, played for Evans. Berk-
man said, "The confidence that
he ‘would give a kid in the
process of choosing him as one
of his seven or eight players was
unbelievable. I knew he believed

-in me and it make me better."

finest conversion is Navy senior
David Robinson. The 6-11 center
grew from an awkward freshman
into an All-American who plays
the inside game with the seem-

said, ”I think the one thing that
David would say I gave him,
more than technique or any num-
ber of things, was .confidence to
do his best and to feel he could
do more than maybe'even he
thought he could."

The Paul Evans Era began last
Saturday night at Fitzgerald Field
House as Pitt, a contender to win

' the Big East Conference, beat In-

diana University of Pennsylvania,
an NAIA school, by a score of
108-49. -
One thought. immediately
comes to mind: Here we go
again. For the zillionth time, the
Panthers will buttress their confi-
dence and preseason win—loss
record at the expense. of in-

competent small college teams .

before the Big East slate begins in
January.

This has been the tradition at
Pitt since former coach Roy Chip-
man started the job in I980. The

. Panthers usually play the likes of

Westminster, Lafayette, Robert

' Morris and numerous other ”cup-

Cakes” before the conference sea-
son begins.

But, believe it or not, despite
the fact that Pitt opened this
year's schedule against weakling
IUP and it plays on the road
tonight against the undermanned
St. Francis Red Flash, the Pan-
thers will play their toughest non—
conference schedule in recent

JOI-IN
ENRIGHT

memory. .
After playing against the Red
Flash, four of Pitt's next six games

' are against 1986 NCAA tourna-

ment teams (Illinois, West Vir-
ginia, Xavier and final-four
participant Kansas), one is with a
1986 NIT team (Brigham Young),

and the other is against Robert

Morris.

During the Big East conference
schedule in January, the Panthers
still have three non-conference
games to play against the Du-
quesne Dukes, the Akron Zips
and the Chicago State Cougars.

Akron and Chicago State! Yes,
Akron and Chicago State! These
are two teams the Panthers
should be able to defeat, espe-
cially because both games will be
played at Fitzgerald Field House.

But remember that's what
everybody has said about Xavier
the past two years, and look what
they have done to Pitt.

It's hard to be a tough team in

the clutch during the Big East sea- “

son when you haven't played a
nail-biter in December.

This year, that has changedp

The toughest stretch of the Pan-
thers’ upcoming non-conference
schedule is Dec. 23-30. The Pan-
thers play a talented Brigham
Young team on the road on Dec.
23.

You only have to look at the
fact that BYU plays in an arena

_ that seats 23,000 people to know
why this will be a difficult con- ‘

test for Pitt. Plus, the Cougars

   
 

  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

 

 

 

have four starters returning from
|ast_year’s squad which went to
the third round of the National In-
vitation Tournament before
losing. ’

Believe me, Brigham Young
will be a very difficult game for
this Pittteam. '

The Panthers then travel. to
Honolulu for the Rainbow Clas-
sic. Pitt will be matched up
against the Kansas Jayhawks in
the opening round. Meanwhile,
strongteams such as Ohio State,
Arkansas, Florida and’California
are among the remaining squads
the Panthers could possibly play
in the later rounds of the eight-
team, three-game tournament.

 
 

These four games should tell a
lot about the ability of this Pan-
ther basketball team. And that in
itself is a unique situation.

In past years, Pitt's true ability
as a team wasn't uncovered un-
til they got into the heart of their
Big East schedule. '

But this year, because of those
four games and the earlier con.-
tests against Illinois, West Vir-
ginia and Xavier,-the Panthers’
potential will be detected quick-
er than you can say trouble.

In short, it is at this time that we
should know how accurate all
those preseason polls were that

picked Pitt among the Top 10’

teams in America.

Evans is a proven winner,
backed by his 242-I10 record, a
.688 winning percentage. ’’_I think
we have the talent here at Pitt to
be successful. It was a goal of
mine, like any coach, to be in

His assistants are John Calipari,
Mark Coleman and Norm Law.

They have enough talent to
field a competitive NBA fran-
chise. In the backcourt, the point
guard is sophomore Goodson, a
deft ballhandler comparable to
former North Carolina star Jimmy
Black. At shooting guard is team
captain senior Aiken, recently rat-

ed by Sport Magazine as one of
the 10 best three-point shooters
in the nation.

of Michigan as a high school
senior. Blessed with magnificent
leaping ability, Gore is notorious
for his creative slam-dunk exhibi-
tions, but said, "I've been work-
ing on my outside -shot, which I
think I've improved. I'm concen-
trating on being able to hit the
open outside shot.”

Gore also must improve on his
measely 2.8 rebounds per game
of last season, taking some bur-
den from  drumroll, please 
The Man Who Rules the Paint —
Charles Smith. Smith led the team

-in rebounding last year and

finished second to Gore i_n
scoring.

’'I don't think there's a 6-10
player in the country who's more
versatile than Charles Smith,”
ESPN basketball commentator
Dick Vitale said. After his spec-
tacular summer, Smith is looking
forward to a big year. ”We have
five starters who can match up

with anybody in the Big East. Our
problem is our lack of depth.
That's the area where other teams
have the advantage. But I think if
we can keep out of foul trouble,
things will go well,” said Smith.

As Smith admitted, the Pan-‘

thers are about as deep as the
Fifth Avenue River during a Pitts-
burgh rainstorm. Senior center
Tico Cooper and freshman swing-
man Rod Brookin are_ the first
men . off the bench. For-

ward/centers Steve Maslek and '

Rich Carrigan give added sup-
port. As for pure guards, Evans in-
herited none. He dipped into the
free-agent pool and suited up
three walk-ons — Scott Colombo,
John Luther and Pat Cavanaugh.

For the second consecutive
year, great things are expected
from the Pitt basketball program.
Smith and Gore will be thekeys
as the Panthers move from remis-
sion to respectability. Let the
Evans Era begin.

THE PITT NEWS,lWednesdiay, December 3, 1986

By John Enright
Sports Editor

Try to picture Demetreus Gore
and Paul Evans getting along.
Now something about that
doesn't sound right, does it?

Why doesn't it? First of all, for
those who don't know, Gore and
Evans both are vital members of
the Pitt basketball program. 66%.
Gore is a junior forward who was
Pitt's best player last season,
while Evans is the new head
coach of the Panthers.

Yet, they are two drastically

. different personality types, so

much so that many believed they

. wouldn't be able to get along at

all.

Gore, on the one hand, is an
extremely confident, street—wise
young man who developed into

somewhat of a basketball star last '

season.

He is very good, and he knows
it. While being Pitt's top scorer
last year, Care was nevertheless,

Care discovering
  anotherside of ‘Me’

who utilized his many talents to
rise to stardom as one of the bet-
ter players in the Big East Con-
ference. .

”Me,” one of Gore's nick-
names, accurately portrayed his
past season's attitude. It was De-
metreus’ show, and no one could
stop him. '

On the flip side of the coin is
Paul Evans, former Navy head
coach. That alone just about tells
the story. He is, to say the least,
a disciplinarian. It will be his way
or the highway, and he lets every-
one know it. .

.While Gore was the main at-
traction last season, Evans will as-
sume those duties this year. But
don't take that the wrong way.
Evans doesn't want to'be on
center stage. He just wants every-
one to know who's the boss.

That is where the perceived
problem between Gore‘ and
Evans is supposed to lie. Many
doubted Gore's ability to adapt to
Evans’ ways.

Even Evans himself was in-
formed that a problem was in-
evitable between him and Core.
’’I was getting calls from people
in the Midwest saying, ‘You and
Gore are going to be at opposite
ends of the spectrum,’ ” said
Evans. _

The way things began when
Evans took the job on March 26,
it appeared that would be the
case. . ‘

Evans explains, ”Gore’s a little
bit more standoffish than the rest

_ of the other players.

”The other players were a lit-
tle more fon/vard about coming in
to meet me. Demetreus had a

kind of wait-and-see-what’s—'
' going-to-happen type of attitude.
”The first time I had apything

[problem] with him was when I
saw him with an earring in his
ear. Then he came up a few
weeks later, and it was the first
time I had seen him since it hap-
pened. He made a joke about it-
ithe earring] being just a passing
ad.” ' -
Gore remembers the'incident
well. ”He didn't even have to say
anything to me,” said Gore. ”l
just took it'[the earring] off.”

Since then, the two haven't had -
any problems. In fact, Evans‘

holds his talented starting small
forward in_a more than positive
light. ”|’ll tell ‘you, Gore has
worked his ass off,” said. Evans.

continued. from page 9
”couldn"t shoot a lick, but he was
a tough rebounder.”

The idea that a young boy
without breat skills could make it
as a basketball player belonged to
Evans’ high school coach, Morris
Hickey. Evans said Hickey
”paral|e|ed athletics and basket-
ball with what life was all about.
He talked about how there were
a lot of different ways to succeed.
He was not a good 'X—and—O man
himself, as I look back on it, but
the way he could motivate you
and get everyone to work as a
team was remarkable.”

Evans builds winning teams
from those same ingredients. He
endured mediocre seasons at

Navy (9-16, 12-14) in order to de-
velop his type of players — those
willing to place winning above
the need for the spectacular.

”Too many coaches sell their
souls to these kids,” he observes,
”and then you have the tail wag-
ging the dog.

”I tell them some coach can
give you all the propaganda -
posters and T-shirts — but you
have to ”play” for for me. If you
can do that, great. But if you
can't, myshowing you a film or
some other gimmick is not going
to make the situation better for
you or me."

Evans displayed similar candor
to the Pitt team during their first
meeting. ”The one thing that I

said to the group was that last
year you did it your way and you
saw the results. This year, we are
going to do it my way.

”We started at that point and
that's all we talk about the past.
The kids agreed and they've been
great,” said Evans.

He doesn't have to read the
press clippings to know what .is
expected of this group he's in-
herited. ’’If our kids can believe
in themselves and be a little less
selfish, they will come around.
There is a lot more talent overall
here than at Navy. If they start

having the same feeling of confi—~

dence we did there and start do-
ing the same things, we'll be in
great shape.” ’

On board the Botshobot, Evans
has pondered the warnings of
skeptics who say that his dis-
ciplined coaching style — which
played in the well-postured» and
ordered world of the Naval
Academy —— will meet resistance
in the domed playgrounds of the
Big East conference. He dis-
agrees. ’

9 ’’People said it would be a
sh_.ock after being with the kids at

Navy,” he said. ”I think kids are,

kids, especially when you are
working with athletes.”

Nor does he worry that the
notoriety afforded Big East
coaches will change his
philosophy. He reasons, ”I think
some of the guys who worry

about (exposure) become bigger
than the game itself. My ap-
proach has always been and will
continue to be —— even at this lev-
el — that its a kids’ game. It
should be fun for them. I'm here
to make them the best that they
can be, not to be a showman out
there.”

At the end of a tranquil day on 1

the bay, Evans turns for shore and
the responsibilities that come
with his recent success:

He pulls down the sails and se-
cures his boat until another day.
The guy some are calling the next-
great college basketball coach

will leave tranquility behind for A '

another season, one that many
are hoping will be his finest yet.

Gore

.continued from page 12

”IfI had all Cores, I would be in‘

good shape.”

Evans isn't the only one who
thinks so highly of Core. Team-
mate Rod, Brookin, a freshman
forward who will be playing be-

hind Gore this year, highly ‘

praised him. ”I have been very
impressed with Demetreus,” said
Brookin. ’’In the game against
Australia, he looked like a little
Dr. J out there with all his

moves.”

Dr. J is going a bit too far, but
thereis no doubt Gore has all the
talent to be a great player.
Although if you read any of the
preseason basketball tabloids,
you will hardly see any’ mention
of Gore as an All-America candi-

date. And, after a superb sopho---

more campaign in which Gore

 

averaged‘ I6.I points a game and
shot .555 percent from the field,
that is quite a surprise.

Core, for one, isn't worrying
about that, though. ”I don't know
why it is like that, but I try not to
think about it because it will just
distract from the team if someone
is worried about themselves,”
said Gore.

Still, Gore has set a few per-
sonal goals for himself this year.
’’I think I could be one of the bet-
ter players in the Big East,” said
Gore, ”and maybe even the
country ifl play hard and play un-
der control.”

Ah, control. That is the key for
Gore to make the step from be-
ing a good player to becoming a
‘great one. Last year Core led the
team with 95 turnovers, more
than three er game.

”My freshman year I did play
out of control because I was get-
ting used to a new system, but I
didn't last year,” said Core. ’’I
think it's blown out of proportion.

_If someone else did something I

did, people would just ignore it.

”I never believed that we were
selfish last year. I thought it was
just. the fact that we were losing,
so people pointed to negative
things and made it/seem that we
were a little selfish, which some-
times everybody is. But when
you're winning, nobody sees it.”

Win or lose, this year Pitt fans _

will watch a basketball team with
a team concept, and that should
be good for everyone-

”This year everything’s a lot
more organized,” said Gore.

_”There’s no letting up and Coach

[Evans] is always on you.
And how does Demetreus feel

about that coach who is ”always
on you"? ”I have no complaints.
He has complete control, and

he's earned everyone’s respect,”

commented Gore.

Apparently, Gore and Evans
are on the same wavelength. So
all those people from the Mid-
west were wrong after all. Now
that the potential problem is

Practice   makes perfect

It also makes players feel sore the following morning

By Greg Sysyn :
Staff Writer

Whether the Pitt Panthers
basketball team will be success-
ful this season depends on its
record, which depends on its
scores, which depends on its per-
formances, which depends on
basketball practice.

Practice. It is a dirty, double,
four-letter word among players.
They define it as three hours of
sweat, blood, cramps and floor
burns, usually accompanied by
fatigue and sore muscles on the
following day(s) and rarely, if
ever, accompanied by television
coverage or excited spectators or
anything remotely associated
with glory.

Practice. The unsung hero of all
sports. In the past, the Panthers
have become notorious for not
living up to high expectations.
Maybe one of those reasons was
their lack of sweat, blood, cramps

and floor burns.

That won't happen this year.
Coach Paul Evans won't let it. If
you happen to watch the Pan-
thers practice at Fitzgerald Field
House, bring a bucket. Enough
sweat is produced to water every

into five-on-five game situations
and practiced plays they will be
using this year. They went full-
court the whole time. A college
basketball game takes 40
minutes, but Pitt played a
60-minute game 30 minutes into
practice, the only difference be-
ing that the scoreboard was off.

6:25-7:05: For the first 20
minutes, the first team practiced
the fastbreak against the second
team. Then came more game
strategy. This time, the first team
worked on half-court offense and
defense and out-of—bounds plays.
Practice: concluded _ with free-
throw shooting.

This is a typical Evans practice;
it typically runs overtime.

”One of the basic reasons I am
so demanding in practice is that
you can't turn execution on or
off," Evans said.

”We try to make practice as
much like a game by simulating
game-style pressure situations.

We will do whatever I think we -

need to be a better team. A lot of
basketball teams have equal tal-
ent. The difference between who
wins_ and who loses is between
who executes better."

In The Sporting News, Evans
was referred to as the Mad Doc-
tor. He is not especially vocal on

the practice floor; he patrols prac-

tice with his eyes, not his mouth.
His words are sparse, and each,

regardless of its decibel level,

commands the attention of the
entire team.

’’I try to be unpredictable,”
adds Evans. ”As'soon as -you get
into predictable trends, the kids
get into ruts  That doesn't help
anyone. . '

”When I yell or when I get
mad, it's for the benefit of the
kids. Some coaches make it a per-
sonal vendetta, and you start
hearing about who is in whose
doghouse. For me, once the prac-
tice is over, it's done.”

it never ends for the walk—on 0

players. Scott Columbo, John
Luther and Pat Cavanaugh prac-
tice up to four hours every day,
even though they are, non-
scholarship athletes who will
play little during the season. But
their efforts make the starters bet-
ter, which makes the team better.

”He’s the‘ hardest man on
earth,” freshman Rod Brookin
said of Evans. ”The title The Mad
Doctor fits him well. But he treats
everyone the same, and he ex-
pects the same from everyone in
return.”

”Practices this year are definite-
ly tougher than the past,” Charles
Smith said. ”He expects 100 per-
cent from everybody. Coach
Evans wants total commitment

from everyone  It's more dis- 9

ciplined than last year.”
Brookin and Smith headed to
the showers to wash away the ac-
cumulated sweat of another
practice. ‘

 Big East full of questions; V
Pitt, Villanova hold answers

...a--

By Jim U rban
Editor-/'n—Chief

For the past four years, the Big
East has been a conference
_known for its superstars. Things
change, however. This year, there
are more question marks than su-
perstars. '

Patrick Ewing is only a mem-
ory. So is Chris Mullin. Walter

Berry and Pearl Washington both P

skipped their final year of eligibil-
ity. They are gone, too.

Who are the stars this year?
There are none yet. Who's the
favorite? It's a toss—up.

BIG. EAST
PREVIEW

-In a preseason, Big East

' coaches poll, five different teams

received first-place votes. Lo'ok-

ing up and down the team ros-

ters, it is no wonder the ”experts”

are having problems picking a
favorite in the Big East.

0 Last year's conference cham-
pion, St. John's, lost national
player of the year Walter Berry
and his 23 ppg average.

0 Georgetown, the preseason
coaches’ favorite, lost two four-

year starters, guardsMichael Jack-‘ .

son (10.5 ppg) and David_Win-
gate (15.9 ppg), along with center
Ralph Dalton (7.7 ppg, 7.2 rpg).

.0 Villanova lost leading scorer
and leading rebounder Harold
Pressley (16.7 ppg, 10.1 rpg).

- 0 Syracuse lost its top three
scorers, Washington, Rafael Ad-
dison and Wendell Alexis, close
to 50 points per game on offense.

The list goes on.

The teams that didn't lose play-
ers, like Pittsburgh and Provi-
dence, are the teams with
question marks at key positions.

0 Pittsburgh, ' under new head

/coach Paul Evans, has question
m'arks at center, where Charles
Smith must dominate but stay out
of foul trouble, and at point
guard, where sophomore Mike

' Goodson must be the glue that
holds the team together.

0 Providence has guards in Bil-

ly Donovan, Delray Brooks and,

Pop Lewis, but a question mark

on _the _ front line where 6-10 ’
senior Jacek Duda and 6-7 c|ass- ‘

mate Dave Kipfer must have an
impact. , _
Seton Hall, Boston College and

. Connecticut, meanwhile, are all ,

rebuilding. _
it is a year when a 10-6 record
‘may just win- the conference.
Talking to the coaches, that is the

may have the best three-point
shot in the conference.

general consensus, but who's the
favorite to win the conference?

It might be Pittsburgh.

When the Panthers entered the
conference in 1982, then coach
Roy Chipman calledit taking a
step backward and two steps for-

ward. This year may be the year
that Pitt finally completes that

second step-

Smith, a junior from Bridge-
port, Conn., was voted the
preseason player of the year by

the conference coaches. His sup- .

porting cast, Demetreus Gore,
Curtis Aiken and friends, is not far
behind, either. Pittsburgh is ex-
pected to be there at the end.
”This is the year that everybody

’ should have picked Pittsburgh,”

Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim
said. ”Everybody picked them
last year, and they didn't do any
good, so -nobody picked them
this year. That isstupid. They
were freshmen and sophomores

_ last year.”

players: senior Willie Glass,
junior Shelton Jones and senior
John Hempel. . .

Those are four top teams with
plenty of question marks, which
leaves the dark horse and the
team that will win the regular sea-
son conference title — Villanova.

The Wildcats will play that pat-
ented man-to-man/zone defense
and give their opponents fits, as
they do every year. «

On offense, 5-9 sophomore

a top point guard, and Harold

Jensen, a 6-4 senior, could turn »

out to be the conference's most
prolific three-point shooter.

- In the frontcourt, 6-6 sopho-

more Doug West, 6-7 senior
Connally Brown and 6-7 junior

Mark Plansky form a solid trio. ~

Coach Rollie Massimino can
choose from 6-11 senior Wyatt

Maker, 7-2 freshman Tom Greis ‘

or 6-10‘ freshman Barry Bekke-.
dam at center. . -

The Wildcats’ conference-
winning record could be no bet-

ter than 12-4 but no worse than

.10-6.

One reprieve for the rest of the

conference teams will be the Big
East tournament. The team with
the best starting. five will win the
tournament. Villanova may have
the luckiest starting five but not
the best. Pittsburgh will prevail in
the end. .

Lone freshman Brookin feeling

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

If the old saying ”There is
strength innumbers” is true, Pitt
‘basketball fans are in for a big sur-
prise this year.

Although the Panthers have a
great nucleus with Charles Smith,
Demetreus Gore, Jerome Lane
and Curtis. Aiken, they were
snakebitten‘ by Proposition 48,
leaving the team with virtually no
depth.

Three/ of Pitt's basketball
recruits for this season fell victim

/" to the academic guidelines of

Proposition 48, while a fourth
recruit failed to graduate from

junior college, leaving Pitt with ,

only nine scholarship players. -
One freshman who did escape
thehazards of Proposition 48 was
Rod Brookin, a 6—foot—5‘/2 for-
ward from Steelton-Highspire
High School near Harrisburg, Pa.
Brookin left Steelton-Highspire
High School as the school's all-
time leading scorer with 2,409
points and as its leading rebound-
‘er with 1,186 rebounds. I

Being the new kid on the block _

isn't always easy. Brookin,

...known as ”Rockin" to his team-
- mates, has found college basket- '

ball to be a big‘ adjustment.

St. Francis’ big gun H

As the only freshman eligible to
play this season, it would seem
that Brookin has some added
pressure to perform well, but he
isn’t'so sure about that.

”The only real pressure that I
feel is when we're doing drills
and l’m on line,’’ said Brookin,

E referring to a drill in which a play-

er has to run the full distance of
the court and touch each base-
line. ”When the big men or up-
perclassmen get tired and l’m still
on the line, I have to take their
place even if l’m at the end of the
line. This was tough at first, but
I've settled down and am used to
it now.”

For Brookin, the decision to at-
tend Pitt was relatively easy, His
final two choices were Pitt and
Syracuse, but when the Orange-
men signed some other players,
Brookin knew he would have
more of a chance to play at Pitt.
But he probably didn't expect this
much of a chance. Now he could
well be the Panthers’ first player
off the bench.

Pi—tt' coach Paul Evans knows
that his young freshman will have

to contribute, but he's confident’

he-can. ”The last twoiweeks. of
practice Rod really improved,”

said Evans.’ ”'He’s‘ real strong and E
a good rebounder. He's also ..

Morsholl  PITT New-S

inst his old junior‘ college team-

probably one of the best offensive
players on the -team.” «

But as Brookin quickly foun
out in practice, there is a big
difference between college and
high school basketball. ’’I got to
do a lot in high school,_” said
Brookin. ”I got away with a lot
because of my size. I've found
that I can't get away with as much
here.” '

Brookin’s progress has also
been slowed by numerous nag-
ging injuries. First, Brookin had
a stress fracture in his left foot fol-
lowed by tendonitis in the same
foot. After he had recovered from
those injuries, Brookin suffered a
mild concussion in a scrimmage
against West Virginia State.

Despite these injuries, Brookin
says that he is ready to go and is

all set for-the season. ’’I’m ready’

and I know everyone else is,”
said Brookin. ,

When Pitt plays Illinois at Fitz-
gerald Field House this Saturday
night, Panther fans will get their
first look at Brookin in a Pitt uni-
form. But this won't be the first
time Pittsburghers have had a
chance to watch Brookin play._

Last April at the Civic Arena,
Brookin played for the Pennsyl-
vania team in th_e Dapper Dan

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3,‘ I986

Sta ff Writer

It is now understood that Pitt
basketball has adopted the
”Frankies, my dear? We don't
give a damn,” attitudeconcern—

ing. their annual battles with St-
Francis.

True, the Red Flash — also
known as the Frankies by more
affectionate boosters —— have
fallen on hard times over the past
several seasons, but under fourth-
year coach Kevin Porter, the team
has begun to regain some of the
ferocity that characterized Flash
teams of old.

Names like Donny Graham,

I Lew Ridgeway, Charlie Kates,

Napolean Lightning and, of
course, the legendary Maurice
Stokes, have brought well-
deserved respect to the rural col-
lege in Loretto, Pa.

Pittsburgh takes their roundball
show to St. Francis. Another
member of the Red Flash has
stepped to the foreground, ready
to accept the Panthers’ challenge
and continue the tradition. His

' name is Lamont Harris.

Harris, a 6-5 forward/center, is
St. Francis’ finest player in years
— and possibly one of the na-
tion’s best. Eleventh in the coun-
try in scoring last year, Harris
averaged 23 points and 9.8 re-
bounds per game.

Never flashy, Harris just gets
the job done for his team, which
is 1-0 after trouncing Pitt—Bradford
90-72 last Saturday. ”I take ad-
vantage of what I can get,” said
Harris. ”I’m not a fancy player by
any means. There’s nothing real-
ly spectacular about what I do on

   
  

no real p

the court. It's just natural instinct, I

I guess.”

That natural instinct provides
the Red Flash with one of its best
teams - in years, a team that,
despite dropping a 107-72 loss to
Pitt last year, returns all five start-
ers. ”Pitt is a very good team.
They've got a lot of good athletes,
and their new coach provides a
lot of needed discipline,” said
Harris. ”They’re rough. They’_re
tough. But we want to win a
badly as they do.” -

Tico Cooper, Pitt's reserve
center, played with Harris for two
years at Allegheny Community
College, and despite wearing
different uniforms in Division I
competition, the two .remain
good friends. ”Lamont is agood,
solid player,” said Cooper. ”It’s
a shame I missed playing against
him last season, since I "was in-
jured. But this year will be differ-
ent. It's going to be all business,
but we'll still be friends‘ off the

court. Each of us is trying to win. ‘

It should be interesting.”

Pitt, also looking for its second
victory of the season after thrash-

ing IUP on Saturday, has never.

lost to St. Francis. The Panthers
hold a 13-0 advantage in the ser-
ies which began in 1972.

Is an upset possible? With St.
Francis, stranger things have
definitely happened. For in-

. stance, in 1977 the Red. Flash
bumped off Cornbread Maxwell

and his UNC-Charlotte squad, a
teamthat eventually wound up i
the final four. -

However, beating a team as su-

periorly talented as Pitt would re .

quire a bit of intervention from
the school's patron saint. And a

typically awesome performance ‘

from Lamont Harris.

The Pitt women's basketball
team takes to the road tonight to
play West Virginia at 7:30. _

The game will be played at Al-
toona High School, the alma
mater of Pitt's Jenny Shingler and
West-Virginia's Tracy Slowgik.

A sell-out crowd of 3,500 is ex-
pected, and the game will be tel-
evised on a cable station in the
Altoona area.

Thoughts from the first week 0

Now that the college basketball
season is underway, many stu-
dents’ QPAs drop drastically, in-
cluding mine, because more
often than not, watching a good

-ACC or Big East game on ESPN

and listening to Dick Vitale rant
and rave about hoops is a lot
more fun than studying biology,
calculus or whatever.

So heregoes — some idle
thoughts from the first week in
college basketball:

0 The Pitt-IUP game at Fitzger-"

W ald Field’ House on Saturday

L

night was a joke. For those of you
who weren't there, don't worry. '
You didn't miss'much. This is not
meant to slight a brilliantly talent-
ed Pitt team, but as Panther coach
Paul Evans said himself, ”We
don't need to play a Division II
team.” Right on.

If Evans would have left the
starters in the entire game instead

- Shingler and Slowgik were the
star players on last year's Altoo-
na PIAA championship team.

'’It will be a tremendous night
for Jenny, and it should be a good
ball game,” said Pitt women's
coach Kirk Bruce.

The Lady Panthers enter the
game with an 0-1 record, having
lost their opener to American
University last Saturday at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

West Virginia enters the game
with a 2-0 record, having defeat-

of a little more than half the
game, Pitt could have easily won
by 80 points. Believe me. I'm not
exaggerating. —

0 So Louisville, the defending"

national champs, are 0-3. I don't
understandwhy everyone is so
shocked by this. For starters, they
don't have any guards. (Tony
Kimbro playing off-guard at 6-7 is
ridiculous.) Secondly, Herbert
Crook is no longer in the back-
ground where he can quietly play
like an All-American and have
nobody notice, as he often did
last year. Now, he's in the
limelight, and it wil|_be a big ad-
justment for him. And finally Per-
vous Ellison is a young and still
somewhat raw talent. Sure, he
played brilliantly in the.NCAA
last season, but overall his statis-
tics during the year weren't out-
standing. Granted, he's going to
be a great player, but not this
soon. '

Pitt's loss to American was an
especially disappointing one. The
Lady Panthers battled back from
a 10-point, second-half deficit to
take ‘a 55-53 lead and possession
of the ball. _

But two . turnovers and six
points later, Pitt was down 59-55.

for the game. ”Maybe we were
too relaxed,” said Bruce. ”You
tell the girls not to get too
psyched because they may forget
about what they have to do. But
we may have had a relaxed atti-
tude. You can’t turn it on and turn
it off. We need people to pick
each other up.” '

The loss wasn't without its
bright spots, though. Senior
center Jenny Tyner, a starter last
season, came off the bench to
score 22 points and grab eight re-
bounds. -—

eight times, including two critical

he has to do is kick it out to Cur-

shot all night. And if Aiken gets
some defensive attention, he'll
just go back inside to Smith.
Naturally, there are some other
good 3-point shooters in the Big
East, such as Vil|anova’s Harold
Jensen, Boston College's Dana
Barros, Georgetown’s Williams
and Providence’s Bill Donovan.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, December 3, 1986

Gottfried sees bright spots in football team

By Steve McDonell
Staff Writer

Two weeks ago, the 1986 Pitt_

football season drew to a close,
and many people wish it were
already forgotten. Mike Gottfried
is not one of these people.

Pitt managed a 5-5-1 season,
despite having a schedule that
featured four Top 20 teams. ”The
record could have been better,”
according to Coach Gottfried,
”but some things are more im-
portant. There were manybright
spots in another season of medi-
ocrity for the Panthers.”

The kicking game was one of
the better aspects of the 1986 sea-
son. Kicker Jeff VanHorne was
perfect on 26 extra points. He

‘also converted 65 percent of his

field goal attempts. VanHorne’s'
counterpart, John Rasp, had an
outstanding season as well. Rasp
punted 70'times for an average of
38.9 yards per attempt. Freshmen
may have helped the kicking
game, but everybody helped the
Pitt defense.

The Panther crush, led by Jerry
Olsavsky, Tony Woods and Steve
Apke, finished ninth in total
defense this year. Pitt allowed an
average of 276.9 total yards per
game. The defense denied oppo-
nents the run and effectively shut
down the pass. Gottfried feels
that the reason for defensive ex-
cellence in 1986 was ”the over-
all improvement of the
secondary.”

The defensive backfield inter-
cepted 12 passes and returned
four for touchdowns thanks to

' ”the improved coverage abilities

and pass rush.” Many of the in-
terceptions halted scoring drives
and preserved several victories
for the Panthers. These turnovers
also gave the ball to Mike Gott-
fried’s high—powered run-and-
shoot offense.

This _run-and-shoot worked fair-
ly well for the Panthers. It was led
by fifth-year senior John Conge-
mi until a back injury ended his
season earlier than expected.
Overall, Pitt quarterbacks aver-
aged 240.1 passing yards a game.’

I want to take this opportu-
nity to express my apprecia-
tion for the support the Pitt
students have given their foot-
ball team during the 1986
season.‘

Your support is very impor-
tant to the Panthers’ perfor-
mance on the field and is an
inspirational force.

I will never forget the way
you stuck with us during the
Temple ”monsoon” —- that
certainly proved you were not
”fair-weather?’ fans.

My staff and I are nowhard
at work with our recruiting ef-

A note to the students
from Mike Gottfried

forts, and I promise you we
work unceasingly to recruit
student—athletes who will be
proud to be Pitt Panthers.

With your help, we will, in
the very near future, have Pitt
back into the Top 10 of Ameri-
ca’s college football teams and
challenging once again for a ‘
national championship.

I am honored to be the head
football coach of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and to be one
with you in saying, ”PlTT IS
IT!''

Mike Gottfried

Their proficiency enabled Pitt's
passing attack to finish 18th in the
nation.

One player who received
many of the live balls from the
quarterbacks was Craig Heyward.
Gottfried feels that he was one of
the most important factors of the
1986 season.

”The emergence of Craig Hey-
ward as an impact player was one
of the necessary developments of
the year,” said Gottfried.

Heyward led all of the Pitt rush-
ers with 756 yards. He also
caught 29 passes for 361 yards.
Heyward’s 254-yard rushing per-
formance against Miami in a na-
tional telecast typified the effort
he put forth all season long. Hey-
ward was spurred on by some-
thing very important to _ all
football teams: the fans.

Mike Gottfried was ”excited by
the enthusiasm of the student
body toward the Pitt football pro-
gram.” Gottfried tried hard’ to
please the cheering masses, but
Pitt just had too many obstacles
to overcome in order to have a
winning season.

There were a few minor
problems like the transition of
coaching staffs and the lack of
depth of the roster, Both of these

problems can be overcome in

time. There was one major
problem, though, which could
have been conquered if there
were more time — injuries.

The defense suffered many in-
juries. Tony Woods was lost for
one game; Tony Siragusa sat out
two. Teryl Austin, last year's lead-
ing interceptor, missed four
games. The loss of these key play-
ers was serious but minute in
comparison to what the offense
suffered.

The offense was clicking’ just as V
Mike Gottfried had planned."
Then a rash of injuries hit the run--

and-shoot scheme. The cog that

made the offensive machine ,

work, John Congemi, was hurt
and gon_e for the year. The posi-

When I was 10 years old, my
parents got me a lot of Christmas
gifts. That's not exactly unusual
for a 10-year-old. The odd part
was the two gifts which occupied
most of my time.

The gifts in question were two
books,The History Of The Pitts-
burgh Steelers, by Ray Didinger,
and Great Pro Quarterbacks, by
the sports staff of The New York
Times.

These books made such an im-
pact on me that I memorized
them. That's right, I memorized
them. A pair of 300-page—long
books.

I can still remember standing
up in front of my fifth-grade class
at Ruffsdale Elementary School
and listening to my teacher, Mrs.
Zelenka, begin a sentence. In-
evitably, I would interrupt her
and finish the sentence.

Ican’t do that any more. I’m 11
years older and so are the books.

But I remember one thing. It hap- '

pened with 1:40 left in the 1957
NFL championship game. The
Detroit Lions trailed the

Cleveland Browns 16-10 and had
the ball 82 yards from the end
zone.

~ The field was muddy, and both
teams had difficulty moving the
ball in the second half. It looked
as if the Browns would win their
third consecutive championship.

But Lion quarterback Bobby
Layne leaned into the huddle and
said to his teammates, ”Let’s get
this ball moving.” Actually,
Layne probably had a little pro-
fanity in there, but this is a fami-
ly newspaper.

Layne dropped back, and with
everybody expecting him to
throw to star halfback Tom ”The
Bomb” Tracy, Layne went to
Cloyce Box, a defensive end who
was switched to offense for this
game.

Box caught the first three pass-
es of his pro career, the last for
the touchdown that gave the
Lions the victory, 17-16.

Layne died Monday at the age
of 59, 29 years after his finest day.
He is still regarded as one of pro
football's finest quarterbacks. In

tion was filled, and some feel
very admirably, by Joe Felitsky
and Sal Genilla, both of whom
will fight it out for the position
next year. But they just didn't
have the experience to fill Con-
gemi’s shoes. ‘

The loss of Congemi, coupled
with the loss of other offensive
players, spoiled any remaining
hope of a postseason bowl bid.
The main problem, according to
Gottfried, was ”the inability .to
field the same team week after
week.” It is fortunate for the Pan-
thers that injuries heal with time,
and that everyone should be
healthy and ready for next year.
And right now, next year looks
terrific.

The Panthers are losing only
five starters from this year's
squad. With most of the same
players returning, Mike Gottfried
”expects a lot more” from his
players using ”virtually the same
offensive and
schemes.” The offense will have
-a new leader next year, and in
limited play, both Fe|i,ts_ky' and
Genilla have demonstrated that
they havethe skills to become
this leader. I

Mike Gottfried did well for a
first-year coach. He acC.om-
plished many of the things he set
out to do at the start of the sea-
son. He is happy, even though
more wins would have been
nice.

Gottfried should get the wins
he seeks next year. This will prob-
ably be a result of the talent of his
returning team, his recruiting and
his good coaching.

After a grueling summer condi-

Brookin is pleased with playing

to handle the ball a lot more, and

Coach Shelton "Collier pointed ~

out that, ”Nebraska will_p|ay [us]

This is due in part to the
Nebraska—Pitt match up of two
years ago in the first round of the
NCAA tournament. Pitt was

handed a 1-3. loss. However, .

Nebraska barely won the final
game of the match 18-16 'n

The Lady Panthers are lool.ing
at the opportunity to play the
Cornhuskers in several d’fferent
ways. The first—round, NCAA
berth is a reward following a
tough season and a Big East title.
Collier noted that ”we accom-
-plished our most important goal
in winning the Big Easftitle.” Col-
lier added, ”We’re not expected
to win at Nebraska, but we have
the opportunity to play and beat
a team in the Top 10 in the na-
tional tournament.” _
The Lady Panthers have been

they don't have a chance to beat

to catch them off guard. Nebras-

Coach Collier stated,‘ ”/We will

* D’Amico optimistic despite“
his team's lak f depth

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer ‘

The outlook for the 1986-87
Pitt men's gymnastics season is a
hopeful one. Pitt head coach
Frank D’Amico feels that the Pan-

thers could go as high as No. 2 _

in the East region.
”This is the best bunch of guys

I've ever had in terms of attitude, ~'

sincercity and discipline,” said
D’Amico. ”They work efficient-
ly together as a team. There are
no individualists.”

In their first meet of the season,
at Navy on Nov. 8, the Panthers
were without Jorge Sanchez and
Ben Rovee, both of whom are
contenders for nationals. The
Panthers took fourth out of nine
teams.

D’Amico stated, ’’I’m a little
worried about our lack of depth.
We don't have many back—ups,
and it's unlikely to go through a
meet without someone getting
hurt. Since there's no rest in gym-
nastics, we train every month.
Any injury will hurt the team.”

The Panthers hope to add some
depth to the squad with three
all‘around freshman performers,
Brock Freehling, Pat Pollacci and
Jorge Gonzalez.

The Panthers’ top returning
gymnast is Sanchez, a junior from
New York. Sanchez is coming off
two impressive years. In both his
freshman and sophomore years,
Sanchez made the All‘-East team,
which is notable since only five
gymnasts make that. team each
year

Two of the returning seniors
are Rovee and Mike Mealie. Ro-

vee, from New Jersey, has a good '"

chance of making nationals this
year, since he missed making it
last year by only one-tenth of a

point. ”Ben is very consistent and A

a good competitor,” added
D’Amico. ”Mealie is a‘ side
specialist, which is the hardest
event, and he developed into an
all‘around performer.”
D’Amico is also wary of the

Panthers’ schedule. ”Our sched-'

ule is a problem since it's so
spread out,” sad D’Amico. ”lt
will be difficult to keep the guys
