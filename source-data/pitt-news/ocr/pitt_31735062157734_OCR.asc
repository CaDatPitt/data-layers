State May Aid.

Medical School

Two Allegheny county legisla-
tors, Senator John M. Walker, Re-
publican, and Joseph M. Barr,
Democrat, proposed a state grant
to aid Pitt’s medical program.

Under the grant, which is one
of four bipartisan bills aimed at
increasing Pitt’s, ‘medical facili-
ties, the University will have to
raise $3 for every $1 appropriat-
ed by the state.

If Pitt accepts the grant, it will
agree_ to expand the medical
school to accomodate 50 per cent
more students than it can at pres-
ent. Pitt now accepts 101 fresh-
men ayear.

Other features included in the
Barr-Walker proposal are: an ap-
propriation for a twoyear opera-
tion of Western State Psychiatric
by Pitt and one to help in the con-
‘struction of a nurses’ dormitory.

The goal for Pitt’s Medical Pro-
gram originally stands at $19,-
450,000 in which Federal and
State aid had been expected. Of
this total $12,700,000 are to ‘be
obtained by a popular campaign.

In reference to the proposal,
John B. Stauif, public relations
director of the building fund,
states “-It (the grant) .doesn’t
changethe status of the campaign
at all. We still need the $12,700,-

dance, you may win an album of
 records as a door prize.

“April Showers,” scheduled for

April 1 at Syria Mosque from 3

to 6 p. m.,- has been the source of
much mystery throughout the

school. It seems students have
been afraid to purchase tickets on
the grounds that the dance was an

‘April fool’s' joke.

However, Barbara Blakely, pub-
'licity chairman, stated, “Not only
is the tea dance the real thing,
but -it is being held as a beneﬁt
to the twelfth ﬂoor.”

- Although the dance is being
sponsored by the junior Women’s.
class, Peg Antoon, president of the
class, wanted it understood that
the. class. of 1950 was only doing
the ﬁnancial backing and “The
more people that come to the
dance, the bigger its succes will
be.” ..

For May 14

Giovanni Romagnoli stated at a smoker last Thursday that his
_ painting for the Italian Room is progressing acording to plan. He
is certain that it will be ﬁnished in time for the scheduled unveil-

The smoker was held by Alpha Phi Delta, social fraternity, at

This shy-looking, soft-spoken, painter was brought from Italy

through the efforts of the Italiané

Room Committee.

Elena Cornaro Piscopia, the
subject of his work, was a bril-
liant- Venetian scholar. She _was
the first woman in the world to be
graduated from a University.

Signora Piscopia was well-
versed in-many languages, math-
ematics, chemistry, music and

literature. Her short life was de-
voted to study and charity.

This “representative” mural
will have an allegorical theme in
which the painter will try to tell
a story, through painting, of Elena
Piscopia. That is, he will present
he as a representation or exam-
ple "of the virtuous, ideal, Italian
woman of the seventeenth cen-
tury.

Mr. Romagnoli declined to com-
ment further on the nature of the
painting. He explained, “Too

,much'talk about it before the un-

veiling will make the public lose
interest.” He. said that further-
more, a full explanation plus
photographic studies of the mural,
which he will give, will be more
effective and understandable upon
completion of the work.”

The painting’ will be in oil on
canvas and in soft, fresco tones.
It will be mounted on the rear
wall of the Italian Room. Its
width will be two -and one half.
meters or approximately eight
feet and it will reach from the
wood paneling to the ceiling in

it is today. Celebrations only last-
ed three days with the traditional
events such ,as Tap Day, Sweep-

Sweepstakes are really the
grandparents of the Spring Fes-
tival. In former years, sweep-
stakes were held before anyone
even dreamed of a Spring Fes-
tival.

Float Parade, another tradition-
al event, used to be handled by
the fraternities. But since the boys
turned the parade into a bur-
lesque, the sororities are now
in charge of it. _

Spring Festival owes its origin to an affair started 20 years
ago called, “Senior Week.” “Senior Week” was ‘usually held the
 ﬁrst week in June, thus enabling the seniors

Spring Carnival is- a compara-
tively young member of the clan,
having made its ﬁrst appearance
in 1935. Up until last year Car-
nival was only a one night aifair
usually "held in places such as
Trees Gym, Lilly Court, or the
Cathedral lawn. ,

Main dances i_n former years
were held in places like the
Schenley Hotel. Name bands were
unheard of‘ at these ‘affairs, but
in 1929, a young unknown band
leader, Kay Kyser, made an im-
pression that’s been growing
through the years.

It wasn’t until the end of the
war that Spring Festival became
the six—day affair that we know.
With a budget of approximately
$12,000, many new things such as
band concerts, tea dances, Pitt
Players productions, and lunches
have been added. ‘

The largest crowd ever to at-
tend ,a University affair came to
the main ball in 1947. At least
2500 couples—5000 people jam-
med Hunt Armory for Gene Kru-
pa, Bennie Baker, and Mischa
Auer. _

Biggest attraction last year was
the carnival which attracted close
to 5000 students despite cold
weather. ’

LOCAL MAN MAKES coon
‘ SENSE.’

For seventeen years, George
Doakes has been shaving daily —

even as you and I. He's tried ’em ~

all — razor blades, we mean. Some
were better than others, but none
did What the ads said until — but

, ‘ here's his story:

“Saw a man- in the Pullman using
Pal Hollow Ground. He looked

happy. I asked about ’em. He lent .
: me‘ one. And I've shaved happily
' ever after!”

You don't have to travel to try
Pal Hollow Ground. Say Pal Dou-
ble Edgeor Single Edge at your
local store. You still get 4 blades
for 10¢, 10 for 25¢, 21 for 49¢, 44
for 98¢. Join the millions who

Owl Gets Bird
From Pitt News

The Owl (Pitt’s yearbook)
wasn’t worth a hoot_ last Thurs-
day, as it was skinned, 57-26, by
the News. The victory made the
student newspaper basketball
champion of the publications de-
partment, which is like being the
smartest student in a schoolroom
for idiots.

Prior to gametime, bookies
would not take bets on the year-
book. ‘A yearbook win would be
one for the books,” they shrug-
ged. .

Riflers Take Title

Pitt is king of the only varsity
sport incorporating the three

Drills were to have started last
Wednesday, but bad weather has
kept the Panther netters oﬁ.the
Arsenal courts.

When practice does start, Pitt‘

Coach Dr. Dave O’Loughlin will
welcome back ﬁve lettermen from
last year’s squad. Among the
newcomers will be sophomore
J ohnny Loestetter, a classy tennis
prospect who prepped at Shady
Side Academy. '

With the nucleus of a ﬁne squad
present, hopes are high for the
Panthers to better last year’s rec-
ord of two wins and six losses.

Arrangements made with the
Bureau of Recreation _will enable
Pittto play its ﬁve home matches
on the Arsenal courts.
