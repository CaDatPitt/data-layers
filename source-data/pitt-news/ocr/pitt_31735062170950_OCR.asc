FASC Meeting Explores
BudgetTrimming Plans

by MCNICA A. CIROCCO

The FASC met March 16 with-
out a quorum. Report and agenda
issues from previous sessions
were discussed further.. but vot-
ing could not be conducted.

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg. FASC
chairman. informed members of
the current budget status. Pre-
viously. each dean was asked to
submit a statement on how six
percent of the FASC budget could
be trimmed. This percentage
amounts to approximately $1.000.-
000.

Some of the suggestions in-'
cluded not using. teaching assis-
tants for non—teaching assign-
ments-—this would affect 90 of
600 TAs, the lapsing of 19 faculty
and elimination’ of 20 non-faculty
positions, and cutsof non-person-
nel equipment, such as printing
service. ‘ -

‘'I‘m hoping we do not. have to
adopt measures as drastic as
these." Dr. Rosenberg stated. The
deans were asked to investigate
ways to trim the proposals.

Dr: Rosenberg also said letters
notifying faculty members of sal-
ary cuts are not being sent until
avenues are explored to try to
prevent cuts. '

The need to trim the budget has
been attributed to upcoming in-
creases in operation costs. Fac-
tors include increases in social
security, the estimated cost of
over a third of a million dollars to
move to the new Chemistry Build-
ing, and an increase of $200,000 in
heat and light costs alone.

Two other items discussed were
theproposals to change Under-

graduate Academic Review pro-
cedureseand the issue of "sexist
and racist" attitudes in the class-
room. UAR discussion was cut
short when members decided that
enough time had been devoted to
the procedure proposals and. a
vote would be taken at’ a future
meeting.

\

Attention then turned to the is-
sue of “sexist and racist" atti-
tude in the classroom. which was
brought before the FASC by the
CAS Cabinet. After debating
whether the issue should be dis-
cussed at the FASC level. it was
decided that individual cases of
sex or race discrimination would
be dealt with.

FASC will delay extensive dis-

cussion on the issue itself until

the CAS Cabinet formulated /the
problem in terms of specific is-
sues instead of the philosophical
aspect. CAS Cabinet representa-
tive Ron Eskin agreed to take the
matter back to cabinetmembers.

  Faculty Union Forming

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN
News Editor

Plans were developed for the
formation‘ of a faculty. library
staff, and graduate assistants un-
ion to represent the University s
faculties during collective bar-
gaining procedures at Thursdays
meeting in the -University and City
Ministry Center.

The Pitt -Professional Union
(PCUt.' who sponsored the meet-
ing. has already established re-
lations with the American Feder-
ation of Teachers (AFT). Those
present decided to work with the
AFT during the initial periods of
organizing the almost 1.000 po-
tential Pitt members.

Dr. Van Beck Hall, professor of
History and PPU president, ex-
plained,- “This is not going to

"there are several necessary steps
before a union can be appointed

The PPU. comprised of about

first of these steps which is to
solicit the completion cards by
30 per. cent of the potential group
(about 330 people) stating their
desire to have a union.

The second step, which will take
place two to three months _after
completion of the cards, is an elec-

serve as the group’s representa-

i The derby was held on Lytton

from oncoming traffic to protect
both drivers and spectators.

$160 were awarded to the top
three places.

An elimination heat was held in
which the top half of the cars
qualified. A race determined the
winners.

Each car ran separately and

tried, to complete the 500-foot
stretch first. Not only was speed
essential. but also braking; for
each contestant had one second
added. to his time scorefor ev-
ery ten feet he passed beyond the
finish area.

Safety regulations were strict-
ly enforced. Each driver had to
wear a helmet, face shield, and a
heavy jacket. The car size was re-
stricted and each entry had to
contain not only a roll bar, but
"also a double system of brakes.

upon by each individual builder.

O'Neill discusses his synaesthetic cinema

Artist Explains his Work

by JOHN POULIN

Independent film maker Pat
O'Neill found his way into Pitts-
brugh last Thursda_v to present
his past five years" work in syn-
aesthetic cinema in the (.'arneg'ie
Lecture Hall.

O'Neill. who is currently teach-
ing at the Film School of the Cali-
fornia Institute of the Arts. said
he came into film in 1961 after
doing a lot of work in still photo-
graphy and sculpture. Since then.
he has won first prizes in interna-
tional lilm festivals at Ann Arbor.
Yale. and Oberhausen. West Ger-
many.

0’Neill’s work “is concerned
less with facts than with meta-
physics.' “It’s not what we’re
seeing som uch as the process and
the effect of seeing; that is. the
phenomenon of experience itself.
There is no dialogue and the char-
acters are abstract ideas.”

Says O'.\'eill. "I continually feel

Famous US. Women Ski Team Diet

During the non—snow off season
the U.S. Wome'n’s Alpine ‘Ski Team
members go on the “Ski Team" diet
to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.
That's right — 20' pounds in 14 days!
The basis of the diet is chemical food
action and was devised by a famous
Colorado physician especially for the
U.S. Ski Team. Normal energy is
maintained (very important!) while
reducing. You keep “full” — no
starvation — because the diet is de-
signed that way! It's a diet that is
easy to follow whether you work,
travel or stay at home. ’

This is. honestly, a fantastically
successful diet. If it weren't, the U.S.
Women’s Ski Team wouldn’t'be per-
mitted to use it! Right? ‘So, give
yourself the same break the U.S. Ski
Team gets. Lose weight the scientiﬁc,
proven way. Even if you’ve tried all
the other diets, you owe it to your-
self to try the US. Women’s Ski

. Businessmen appeal to Common Pleas Court

By DAVE MAJERNIK

Extreme traffic congestion is‘

the major reason (Oakland busi-

nessmen give for asking Com-

mon Pleas Court to order Forbes
and Fifth Avenues returned to
two-way traffic.

Leonard Nadel, owner of Leo-
nard’s Men Shop, Forbes and At-
wood, is/one of the plaintiffs. He
said that with the present one-
way arrangement pedestrians
cannot cross the streets because
traffic is always coming from
some direction. ‘

Nadel also noted that the one-
way system eliminated 78-90
parking spaces in the area.

"C_ustomers‘have called me say-
ing they ‘had circled the block
several times without finding a
parking space. and finally went
some place else. I just‘ can‘t

V afford that." said Nadel.

Other areas like Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill, said Nadel, have
parking authorities and parking
lots. Oakland has none of these
advantages, and now more park-
ing has been eliminated, he said.

John Hannah, anotherplaintiff
and owner of the Black Angus
Restaurant. Atwood Street. said
the one-way’ arrangement has
‘adversely’ effected his evening
business at night because of the
parking space shortage. People

are’ also discouraged from com—.

ing to Oakland, he ‘said. because
of the traffic congestion.

“It takes almost 20 minutes to
get‘ into the Medical Arts park-
ing garage on Atwood Street. or
to even circle the block." he
said. -

Hannah said he was also con-
cerned about pedestrian safety.
Just the other day, he said, a
blind man was almost hit by a
car. ‘

Other major plaintiffs are Ho-
‘ward Johnsons on Allies Boule-
vard". Ideal Uniforms at 3717
Forbes. and Robert A. Fulton
3131
orbes.

Attorney for the plaintiffs.
Harvey W. Daniels. said this is
a "class ac-t_i_on" meaning any-
one who leases or owns proper-
ty on or near Forbes or Fifth
Avenues can become a minor
party in the case. Daniels claims
considerable support from "or-

dinary citizens."

Besides causing congestion,
pasing a pedestrian safety risk
and eliminating needed parking
spaces, Daniels said the one-
way arrangement is a risk to ve-
hicle operators moving between
lanes and causes greater use of
side streets by those wishing to
avoid the congestion.

Ambulances rushing emergen-

cy victims to Oakland hospitals
must take longer. roundabout
routes caused by the one-way
streets. said Daniels. Montefiore
Hospital. he said. ‘has issued a
complaint.

Daniels accused Mayor Fla-
herty of “acting in defiance" of
a city ordinance which states that
Forbes and Fifth must be two-
way. City Council voted to allow
the one-way arrangement on a 60-
da_v trial basis starting June 18.
1973. but on October 24. it voted
seven to one to return _to the ori-
ginal two—way arrangement. said
Daniels.

Mayor Flaherty’s excuse that
the change should be made when
repairs to‘ the Melwood Street
Bridge are completed is not val-
id, according to Daniels, because

.it'may take months for comple-

tion of repairs. _
Concern‘for the safety of Pitt
students crossing Forbes and
Fifth was also expressed by Dan-
iels. who said it has been for-
tunate no accident involving stu-

' dents has occurred.
He urged interested students.

to write to councilmen.'Daniels
also invited students to become a
party in the case. and said he
would be available to meet.
speak. and listen to students. ,,

Daniels admitted the one-way
arrangement does speed traffic,
added that this is being done at
the expense of Oakland citizens
and merchants. He suggested, as
an ‘alternative, building an Oak-
land bypass.

Councilman Eugene DePas-
quale's name was removed from
the list of plaintiffs so Ma_yor
Flaherty could not delay court
action by claiming DePasquale
was politically motivated since
he no longerllives in Oakland.
according to Daniels.

The March 26. hearing said ’
' Daniels. will be a "simple case"

because it is "crystal clear that

 

Mayor Flaherty does not have
the authority to make the change."

The judge must render a de-
cision in ten days, said Daniels.
If the judge’s decision is against
the plaintiffs, Daniels said he
would call witnesses to testify.
He expressed confidence that this
would not happen.

THE, Intercultural House Semi-
nar Series of Black-White Con-
frontation will conclude with
its fifth lecture, entitled ‘‘Is
There a Black Culture,” on
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. The main
speaker will be Dr. Donald
Henderson, Associate Provost

Gee on the subject of feminism.
One gets the graphic mental
image of him scribbling off his
editorial with one hand while pro-
tecting clutching his crotch with
the other. Most of his remarks
do not deserve the dignity of re-
buttal but they do afford us the
opportunity to express our views.

His article mentions that one of
the most visible effects of the
womens movement has been "its
most trivial—the unfortunate im-
pact on the language.“ Probably
from his male supremacist view-
point it is unfortunate. It is com-
monly held that language deter-
mines thinking. Believing this. we
would’ say that a more egalitarian
way of speaking and therefore
thinking is hardly a trivial or un-
fortunate event. He gomments
that “all thse changes do is give
the feminine ego a boost at every-
body's expense." We wonder who

is “everybody?"_Women‘ for cen- I

turies were carefully inculcated
from childhood to believe in their
own inferiority and that their pri-
mary role in life is to boostthe
ego of their male counterparts.
Today's feminist revolution is tak-
ing, in language and elsewhere.
what rightfully belongs to wom-
en. Only an entirely new social
consciousness will allow all
women to develop to their fullest
human potential.

We too believe in selection by
qualification rather than by quota.
But it is strange indeed how often
a penis seems to be among the job
qualifications. Women only oc-
cupy two percent of the mangerial
positions in this country. They
haven’t even reached the level of
tokenism yet. .So yes, McGee, un-
til the men who hire stop being
bigoted, we need quotas so that
qualified ‘women will at least
have a chance at the jobs they de-

. serve. And, yes,.men will prob-

ably have to work harderto get
good jobs now thatf5l percent of
the population is finally being
freed from the shackles of house-
work. But men also will have the
opportunity, if they desire it, to
do things formerly socially pro-
hibited, for example child-rearing.

All that is being fought for is

the freedom of choice for both,
' women and men so that all peo-

ple have the option of doing what-
ever is fulfilling rather than the
role that has been precoded since
childhood.

Column and a Half

by JOHN METCALF

At a recent gathering held for the purpose of
distributing honors to members of the University.
a member of the administration spoke briefly on
the general topic of honors. He said that only a few
years ago the .whole notion was in disrepute. and
might well have been seen as an embarrassing elist-
ist hangover in a world which had become ex-
clusively egalitarian. Such. he went on. is no longer
the case, and elitism, so long as it is not blatant. is
returning to good odor among us.

I was pleased. The strain of carefully conceal-
ing even the mildest of my elitist tendencies for
the past several years has been extreme. I had been
observed spending a great deal of time in low sa-
loons. drinking up my patrimony and correcting the
spelling of graffiti in the men's rooms. '

Now it is as though a great gust of unpolluted

air had swept down our many river valleys, smell-
ing good and liberating us all from the tortures of
sinus congestion, both physiological and metaphor-
ic. It was even suggested that we should expect ex-
cellence from our leaders.

The origin of this notion is clearly reactionary;
still. it is refreshing. As is its wont. the University
has taken a clear look at the way of the world as it
is today. and chosen to move in precisely the op-
postie direction. This may seem a little simple-
minded. As a large organization, the University is

no more exempt than any other large organization A

from being basically simple-minded. The world as
it is. being an even -larger organization. is that
much more likely to be simple-minded. We are prob-
ably on the right track. a ‘

The University. like the world. is inclined to be ,

flexible in small matters. rigid in large. Matters of
overall policy and general reality are unlikely to
evolve and change through successive small modi-
fications. They are capable of only one maneuver-
a complete and absolute reversal. No course change
of less than 180 degrees is possible. ‘ I

For a while in the sixties, we were inclined to’

idolize scientists. Intellectual achievement was
respectable. Even administrators got their share
of glory. Some generals were well thought of, be-
fore they all began to resemble William Calley. Cor-
poration executives were showered with honorary
doctorates. The illiterate were furnished with com-
ic strips and sports sections and left to their own
devices. The halls of Federal Government were
staffed almost exclusively by professors from east
coast colleges. '

Richard Nixon was a Pepsi-Cola salesman.
The only possible reaction to all that was mas-

sive swing toward egalitarianism. and the univer-‘

sities led the way. Admission standards were alter-
ed. lowered, or eliminated altogether’. Language
requirements were dropped. Undergraduates were
spared the annoyance of studying the obsolete art
of English compostion.

(This last turned out to have anti-egalitarian
overtones. Some of the most truly mediocre mem-
bers of the University community found themselves
deprived of the inexhaustable ‘supply of freshmen
obliged to study composition. By now many. of
them have probably succumbed to despair at ever
finding an outlet for their ordinariness.)

At any rate the cult of the mediocre has reach-
ed to the highest postions of trust the Republic can
furnish; having peaked. it must now give way to
its successor. The triumph of the deliberately or-
dinary has been nearly total; they need feel no
shame as the sidle from center stage to the niches

- history has provided for them.

’ With only three exceptions they dominate our
lives. It is a shame that the two nominees who would

have brought the most mediocrity to the Supreme '

Court were turned down. out it must be remem-
bered that the men who were chosen to replace
them would seem spectacularly mediocre if they
were not subjected to comparison with Carswell.
History will prove. I am sure. that Burger is the
equal of any man where mediocrity is concerned.
Given-the difference in thier ages. he is also likely
to go on being mediocre much longer than the first
two appointees could ever have hoped.

The other exception is a former professor from
Harvard. This is not his only qualification. The job
of token professor is part-time at best. Henry is
also single; thus he can also hear the burdens of the
office of surrogate swinger. _

Members of middle management run the
whole country. They are everywhere. the bland
men who have never invented or created anything.
the men who will never be chairmen of anything.
but will always be in the board room. They have
reached the mountaintop. and there is only one place
for them to go. They must join the dinosaur and

the Wendell Wilkie delegates in the slow glacier of .
history. They cannot fly. so they must become fos- '

sils. which many of them resemble already.

At this point, the egalitarians mayleave the
room. to arrange for their bones and footprints to
be found in good condition. The rest is only f'or elist-
ists.

Congratulations! I rather wonder how you sur-
vived; no doubt it was difficult. You are now the
wave of the immediate future; until David Eisen-
hower comes to power the world is yours..It is
time to come out of the closet, which you have prob-
ably been using as a bookshelf. The books can be dis-
played again. The cat can go off the pill and have
her kittens in there. You are not alone. i

There is‘ an organization of card-carrying in-_

tellectuals‘ in this andother countries. Members
can be identified by their curious habit of wear-
ing a yellow map-pin in the left lapel of their gar-
ments. always assuming that their garments have
lapels and that they have remembered to get some
map-pins and affix them in the appropriate spot.

The organization is called MENSA. It consists
exclusively of individuals who score in the top two
percent of ‘the whole human population. as deter-
mined by standard IQ tests.

Their only purpose is to be the two percent.

The best, and at one time the only. way to join
MENSA is to write them, asking for a copy of their
preliminary test and enclosing five dollars. Should

the results of this unsupervised test _prove satis— '

factory, you will be invited to take a supervised
test, and donate a further eight dollars and 50 cents.
If successful, you may then pay your dues and wear
the map-pin. You will also then be welcome at gath-
erings of people who have nothing in common ex-
cept that they also are just as smart as you.are.
You will also receive assorted ‘literature from
MENSA, and from its American avatar AMSA. By

now ‘you. have guessed thatthis means American‘

MENSA Selection Agency. That is outdated. It is
more proper to refer to American MENSA Limited.
MENSA is willing to consider the results of
other standard tests. If you were obliged to take
College Xoards, and got a net score of 1300 anyway,
you are in. Send in your evidenceand five dollars.
The same applies to the Graduate Re ord Examin-
ation, though a score of only 1250 is required. The

five dollars remain the same. v
Dues run $15 a year. This may suggest that hon-

ors are getting expensive in the.world. It is worth

/remembering that a year’s supply of the Pittsburgh

Press cost $65 and is not especially exclusive-
Elitists of the world. unite!
You have nothing to lose but yourdues. B .-

really that smart. you can find it yourself. )

Should the U.S. go-yernment
grant amnesty to those men who
evaded the draft?

"Those who deserted must pay
their price. and the price is not a
junket in -the Peace Corps . . . the
price is a criminal penalty for dis-
obeyingthe laws of the United
States."- Richard Nixon. News-
week, Feb. 12.1973.

The issue of amnesty has come

- up more frequently now that the
,U.S. commitment in-Vietnam is
‘tapering off. _

The President has taken a’ firm,

stand against amnesty and mem-

-bers of Congress who disagree .

have not turned campaign speech
promises into meaningful legisla-

tion providing amnesty.- What do,

the students at Pittfeel about am-
nesty? How did they react to the

‘President's remarks? .

“For.__myself,,I‘m against it. If

some guy would rather leave the ’

country than serve it.,he should

be willing to accept’ the punish- »

ment if he wants to return." said

;John Jackson_,.'Army ROTC cadet. I

' f'It may have been a questionable

f war.- but it's‘ the dut_y of‘ t'heciti-
’ zens to serve." -

' Chris Karias, a veteran of the

in war, agreed:-withlJackson, to a,

degree. “I think that there should

,be some payment. I was in Nam

and I’d like those two years back

George Sel1."Preside_nt'of the
Veterans at Pitt. said his organiz-
ation ‘was not taking a stand on
the issues“. -

However. he spoke to the Pitt
News from a-personal viewpoint.
“In one sense. if the war‘ was ‘I
wrong. as most people seem to"

feel, then those who’ went to Cana-
da are right."

He added, “Tolgrant,ainnesty‘is  -

I do feel that each case must be
judged on its own merits.”

"I think it's too emotional an
issue to grant amnesty immedi-
ately." said Marty Maneker.
A-rmy ROTC cadet. “I think per-
haps after about six months time
that there should be a national
referendum Let the public decide.

I don't think the President should '

grant blanket amnesty at this
time."

General student opinion seein-
ed to be‘ running about the same

way as the people we singled out-

. 50-50. but everybody had a set of
‘ conditions that made the answers

difficult to interpret.

So, the Pitt Newstook an im-
promptu poll. The questioniwas
phrased, “Would you or would you
not favor complete amnesty for

those.‘ men, who evaded the ‘draft

by leaving the country?” A _
A About _135 ‘_students_. were polled
in the, Student ‘Union lobbyi‘ the
Towers: lobby-. and the‘ first floor

' of the Hillman Library.‘ The ma-

joriity of opinion, was‘ collected in
Hillman. ' _ l .v M '
Most peoplehad little to say be-
sides -‘_“I‘m for it". or "I'm not for
,it." Many people were surprised
-that thequestion was asked. '

_A relatively large .numb"er_”ofi

foreign students were polled and
almost all we-re in favor of amnes-
«ty. However. they were "deleted

0 from the final total. The response: I

- 92-—lI"m'_in favor of complete am-
-, - nesty- . 7 I
t30~—,I’m not in favor of ‘complete
amnesty. " ~. ,..-A
l3—"-No opinion or undecided.
I From the ‘poll it. appears that
‘the preponderance of student_
opinion‘ is in favor of granting
complete amnesty -to those who

A want it. To assumeithat many stu-
dents were troubled only the word f

__"complete“ could‘ possibily‘ be a
sign that some form of‘ condition-

Junior transfer protests

Lynch C/aims Credit Short Changed

, by JOHN POULIN
“I'm _a junior here—supposed—
ly.“-says Dave Lynch. a transfer
student from De Paul.‘ Lynch
has. been "short-
changed 14 credits" via his trans-

{fer to Pitt. '

Lynch. a communications ma.-

. jor and a‘ WPGHn‘ewscas'ter for "
WPGH. attended the University
of Rhode Island hisfirst year. ..
transferred to De Paul for his

sophomoreyear. and to Pitt for
his third. .

“Pitt accepted all my courses
except for one,” says Lynch. -The
problem, he explains, is that
Rhode Island operates on‘ a four-
quarter calendar, while Pitt has a
tri-semester schedule. The arug-

ment lies in’ t_h_e conversion of i

credit hours.

7 At‘ R‘hode' Isl—an_d. Lynch receiv-
ed 48 quarter hour credits. When .
he transferred to De Paul. he was’

awarded three credit hours for
every four quarter hours at Rhode

, Island. or 36 credits. .

“But Pitt." says Lynch. "gave
me only two credit hours for ev-
ery f’o’ur quarter hours'."
Lynch. "I_ came here with 59 cred-
its and they game me 46.“

“Billwoods from Bakersfield"
is a tribute to a local country mu-
sician who gave Merle (and Buck
Owens) their early breaks.

It's a unique album. The songs

feeling of a deep respect. for the
roots of country music. where tra-

Many country singers today al-

doesn’t.
.Tom T. Hall would rather be
known as a storyteller. He even
calls his backup band the Story-
tellers. His Greatest Hits album
«Mercury» contains some of his
finest work ever.

Perhaps-the most amazing thing

' about Hall-is his ability to craft_ a

song out of the slightest remark
or meeting with a stranger. _

example of this with Hall explain-

.SEA TRAIN musicians put on a fine performance and harvested a hearty

encore.

A 20 minute instrumental.
"Flute Thing." was the high point
of the evening for me. for I was

‘fascinated by l\'ulberg's use of a —
doubleecho chamber for his flute‘-

which made flutes come from ev-
erywhere. and held a pied piper
effect on many in the audience.

Afterleaving the stage, Sea'

Train was called back and per-
formed a pretty song “We Are
Your Children” from their new-
est album, “Watch,” released last
week, with lyrics like “we have
no joy, we know no peace, we die

* from day to day; 0 give us what -

V It‘s a shame,Sha Na Na had to
miss their gig—they're really a
show in them selves. But barring
the unfulfilled expectation of the _
crowd. Sea Train‘s performance
was more than adequate—it was
great.

The four of them begin to,ex-

At first we see them ignoring

cat and mouse game of survival.
Through the course of the play
each character must play the
winner and also the loser.

Emily says, “I have never in
my whole life met a woman who is
half as unhappy as I.” Within that
statement lies a
paradox. I

The post-season playoffs are
considered to be a "second sea-

meaning that some usually medi-
ocre teams have aspired to meet
the challenge of the playoff pres-
sures and pull some amazing up-
sets. The Boston Bruins were sur-
prised by the Montreal Candians
just a couple. of years ago. Tomor-

The ridiculous feud between the NCAA and the, AAU. in

this past weekend.

-‘ which the losers are the amateur athletes, hit close to home

Most people don't know what those initials stand for. and
few probably care. Yet both of these organizations have accu-
mulated a wealth of power, and the objectives of the organiza-
tions when they were formed seemed to have been forgotten.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association is supposed to
be concerned with all forms of collegiate athletics, and itsareas
of influence include the scheduling of competition, regulations
for recruiting and playing the games. and making sure the stu-

dent athlete remains an amateur.

The Amateur Athletic Union does muchlof what the NCAA
does, only with non-collegiate amateur athletics.

Every time the two organizations cross paths. which is

~. quite often, the athletes and spectators end up suffering.

Not much of this affected Pitt until last weekend. Jim Ban-

"ner, Pitt’s fine track coach, was chosen by the AAU to coach
the United States team in the second :  

. U.S'.-Soviet Union indoor track and
field meet. All-American Bill Rea was
chosen to represent. the U.S. in the
- long jump. V
Both Rea and Banner were eager to
represent_ the U.S. Banner called it
.“the greatest thing that has ever hap-
pened to me.” Yet neither .one of them
made it to Richmond, where the meet

was held.

’ This meet was sponsored by the
. AAU. The NCAA. claims it was nev-
 asked tosanction the event. and in any case. it didn‘t. Any
 collegiate athlete who competes in a non-sanctioned event risks

Ilosing his college eligibility. A coach of an NCAA school who
ned upon highly and action is taken against

When Pitt beat St. Vincents in
the season opener, however, the‘
skaters had to earn their 4-2 vic-

however, Pitt skated to a fairly

depending on his glove hand to do

‘ most of the work. The only note-

worthy offensive threat on the
team is Mark Vance. Vance was
the lone representative from the
Vinnies on the WPIHA all-star
team.

Pitt will go into the game in fine
physical condition. Defenseman
Glenn Hyde had sustained a
sprained ankle last week but will
be in the lineup for the playoffs.
Greg Mintz, another regular de-
fenseman, had checked into Pres_v-
byterian Hospital suddenly last
weekend and missed the Du-
quesne game but will be ready for
action tomorrow night.

Buses for the game will leave
from the Fifth Ave. side of the
Student Union at 7:30 p.m. for the
Alpine. Tickets are available at-
the Union ticket office or from
team members. ‘The game will
also be carried by WPGH with
Marty Slomberg handling the play

Diamond Forecast Bright 
Despite Snowy Weather r 

Pitt‘s head baseball coach Bob

Lewis’ luck was sure to break and_

this weekend it was shattered.

The unusually mild spring-like
weather that the Pittsburgh area
has been experiencing over the
past few weeks has enabled Lewis
to take a good, hard look at his
new recruits.

The snowstorm that swept Pitts-
burgh over the weekend. however.

will be sure to put a strain on-imitt

drills. This weather. which is
closer to what area residents are
used to expecting, is enough to
make Lewis and his charges wish
they were back under the sunny
skies of Florida (last year the
squad conducted spring practice
in the Sunshine State).

Despite this intrusion of unfav-

i orable weather things are still

looking good for the Pitt mentor.

V “Things really look promising."
related Lewis. “We have a nuc-
leus of a goodteam. We'll be mov-
ing people around to get a better
hitting team than we had during
the last season."

Lewis well remembers the less
than impressive team batting av-
erage of the '72 squad. that was
9-7. put together. Last year the
Panthers could only come up with
a-.240 average.

A contributing fact to the low
average, according to Lewis, was
the fact that the team looked too
much to first baseman Ken Mac-
ha (a catcher now in the Pirate or-
ganization) to come up with the
hitting that theyfn_eeded.‘

emerged from under a Duke that
had jumped him from behind

wild brawl that resulted in the
termination of the game with a lit-
tle more than three minutes left.

Assistant captain and starting
defenseman Kerry Browne will

out of action for the last regu-
lar season contest after he shoved
referee Jim Armstrong in Pitt's

Carnegie-Mellon wound up the
season by defeating Penn State

gave goalie Jeff Hart and the Tar-
tan defense the lowest goals

The NCAA isn’t the only villain. The AAU is not eager to
cooperate either, and recent attempts at congressional hear-

A _Outgoing sports editor Vince DiNardo was right on target

i_ of the NIT. The Irish played Southern Cal. one of the best teams’
5 in the tournament. and the officials. who apparently were cele-

Notre Dame. With a few seconds left in the game. an out of

Dear Sports Editor,

\This letter is in response to the
article “NIT Pickings.“ by Vin-
cent DiNardo. I would like to ‘say
that I totally agree with "him on his

.comments. Being of Irish decent

you might think that I was pro
Notre Dame like most of the other
Irish. but I am not. I‘m also a lit-
tlesick and tired of all the extra
benefits that the Notre Dame

athletic teams receive just be-

cuase they are from South Bend. I
guess Americans. no matter of
what origin. think that the “Fight-
ing Irish" belongright up there
with hot dogs and applie pie. It's
ridiculous to see. more people
turn out forithe Pitt-t\'otre Dam_e
football game who are for. Notre
Dame than people who are sup-
pose to be for the home town Pan-
thers. Most of the people who
cheer for the players from South
Bend. probably don't even know
where the "place is. But being
taught from‘ birth that Notre

Dame is like the United States and
can do no wrong they remain
loyal fans.

Group wound tip with 23 points for Fairfield.
which is now 18-8.

Let me point out something
about these idols from South
Bend. It's a racist-institution. For
example. the last time the Notre
Dame football team turned down
a bowl bid was three or four years
ago. Thhe reason was this: the
players took a vote to see if they.
would go to the bowl. but if they
went they would give their pro-
ceeds to a minority scholarship
fund. Needless to say they voted
against it and didn't go to a bowl
that year. —

Another thing I believe, which
is more recent, in the case of the
present Notre Dame quaterbaek,
Tom Clemens. If you recall the
quarterback of Notre Dame when

‘Clemens was a freshman was

Cliff Brown, a black‘ man. It is of
m)’
many mistakes Clemens would
make he would still start because

it wouldn’t be economically feasi- _

ble for "Notre Dame to have a
black quarterback on [national
television. -
