State’s open—records
law might change

Kelly Lyons
Staﬁ" Writer

In light of the Penn State scandal,
state-related universities might
find themselves subject to a new
law requiring them to open their
records.

Currently, the only informa-
tion state—related institutions
such as Pitt and Penn State must

make public is in their 990 tax ‘

form. This form includes infor-
mation such as the wages of the
schools’ 25 highest—paid employ-
ees. This is because these insti-
tutions are exempt from Penn-
sylvania’s Right—to-Know Law.
Police and attorneys have found
it difficult to obtain documents
regard.ing_former Penn State
football coach Jerry Sandusky
because the law does not require
the university to hand over any
documents or emails surround-

ing the allegations.

But the law requirements
could change. To make these
partially state—funded universi-
ties more transparent, state.Sen.
John Blake, D—Lackawanna Coun-
ty, has unofficially proposed a
change in legislation that would
make state—relat‘ed institutions
adhere to the Right—to—Know
Law.

Kyle Mullins, a spokesman for
Blake, said that the state senator
has not announced a specific date
on which he will meet with state
legislative leaders to officially
propose the change.

Mullins went on to discuss the
effects the prospective change
could have had on Penn State. “Of
course the tragedy of Penn State
couldn’t have been prevented by
more transparency in terms of
open records,” he said, but he
also said it could have brought

- High rates of car accidents duringthe

Thanksgiving holiday have led‘ the
Pennsylvania Department of Trans-
portation to crack down on danger-
ous driving conditions.

In an effort to. make the roads
safer, PennDOThas repeatedly paired
with police across Pennsylvania to
run Operation Safe Holiday, an ag-
gressive effort to‘ keep drivers safe
from drunk drivin during the holi-
day seasons. The program started
on Nov. 18 and will run throughout
December andjanuary.

 

police start “Operation Safe Holiday”

Last year, a total of 4,380 crashes
and 55.fatalities were reported state-

wide between the weekends before

and after Thanksgiving—- the highest
rate of crashes throughout the "year.

Of that number, 535 accidents were c
g 'alcohol—related, makingup 22 percent
of the total number of alcohol-related

crashes in 2010.

Attorney Michael Rosenzweig, a
partner at Edgar Snyder 8: Associ-
ates and adjunct professor at Pitt Law,
said it’s good that policewill increase
watchfulness to keep people safe. -

“I have seen numerous horren-
dous cases as a result of high school
and college kids gettingtogether over
the holidays and underage drinking,”

said Rosenzweig, who represents
people who are hurt by drunk drivers.
“There are unintended consequences
that can happen on your way home
or at nightwhen driving. You can kill
someone or hurt yourself.”
PennDOT encourages students
in particular to plan ahead and avoid
drinkingandgetlingbehindthewheel

during the upcoming break. Police ”

will use sobriety checkpoints, roving
patrols and regular traffic safety pa-
trols to crack down on motorists who
are speeding, driving aggressively or
driving while impaired. ‘ " A
The number of crashes that oc-

. cur during the Christmas and New

Year travel periods are nearly half of

 

those recorded  Thanksgiving.
PennDOT reports that last year dur-
ing that time, there were a combined
2,035 crashes and 19 fatalities in the
state. -

Rosenzweig acknowledged some
of the reasons students might get be-
hind the wheel after drinking.

“You have a lot of 18-, 19- and
20-year-olds who will come home
from college and see theirfriends and
drink,” Rosenzweig said. “They often
come back with more access to cars
than they had at college. There’s a lot
more people drinking on the road.
Also, many people throw armual holi-
day parties that include alcohol.”

Rosenzweig also wants students

to be aware of the consequences from
selling alcohol to people underage.

“If you are over 21 and you supply
alcohol to a minor, you are legally re-
sponsible for their injuries, or if they
go out and hurt someone else. You
can get arrested; the ﬁnes are very
steep,” he said.

Rosenzweig advises students with
four “dos and dont’s”: Don’.t get be-
hind the wheel after drinking, don’t
get in a car with someone who has
been drinking, do have a buddy sys-
tem and don’t give alcohol to people
under 21.

“Holiday season is a really bad
time with a lot of drinking and driv-

Pitt, Penn State currently not subject to open—records law

Law<1

“some facts to light sooner.”

When Pennsylvania’s New
Right—to-Know Law became ef-
fective in 2009, overhauling the
old law under which all state re-
cords were closed, state—funded
institutions were still marked as
an exception. Graham Spanier,
the former president of Penn
State who was ﬁred earlier this
month after the Sandusky scan-
dal surfaced, was responsible
for proposing the state-related
schools’ exemption from the
Right—to-Know Law in 2007.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
declined to comment on the im-
pending proposal and what it
might mean for Pitt. Currently,
Pitt doesn’t have to reveal any of
its records, including informa-
tion like its research projects and
yearly budget cuts.

ing. The best thing you can do if you
drink is to take a cab or stay put,”
Rosenzweig said.

Edgar Snyder & Associates spon-
sors a“Don’t Drink and Drive Pledge”
on their Facebook page where stu-
dents can sign up and get a chance to
earn giveaway prizes such as cameras,
Rosenzweig said. The next drawing
isjan. 2.

“V/ifiththis Facebook pledge, if you
pledge not to drink, maybe that will
keep you safe and sober this holiday,”
Rosenzweig said.

Morgan Smith, a junior, said sm-
dents should drink responsibly and
know their limits. .

“They should plan to stay wherev-
er they go out at night,” Smith said.

Junior Matt Kaplan noted how
drunk driving could result in unfor-
tunate events.

“It is possibly the stupidest thing
you could do. You are risking your

life, everyone in the car’s lives and the
people on the road,” Kaplan said.

Freshman Sam Wolfagreed.

“Drunk driving can be easily
avoided,” he said. I '

But even if the law is changed,
Erik Arneson, a spokesman for
state Senate Majority Leader
Dominic Pileggi, R—Chester, said
he does not think that Pitt would
have to reveal potential cuts to
yearly budgets.

The Pennsylvania governor’s
office does not have to reveal its
budgeticuts until the budget is
finalized because before then it
is considered “pre-decisional

deliberations.” Arneson said‘

he believes that this is how Pitt
would work as well.

Arneson said that since there
are not a lot of comparable
models to Pennsylvania’s state-
related institutions, which are
a “hybrid” of public and private
schools, it was hard to judge what
to do with them when the law
was made.

Both Pileggi and Blake noted
the difficulty of classifying the
four state—related institutions,
which also include Temple Uni-
versity and Lincoln University,
because the institutions receive
their financial support from both
taxpayers and privategdonors,
unlike state schools which are

‘subject t_o all of the conditions

of the Right—to-Know Law.

Terry Mutchler, the execu-
tive director of Pennsylvania’s
Ofﬁce of Open Records, supports
Blake’s proposal. ‘

She said she thinks that state-
related schools should have to
adhere by the same provisions
asistate schools.

“Anytime you have [taxpay-
ers’] dollars and dimes thrown
into the mix, you should have
accountability,” she said.

Hey student body, take a break. Stuff yourself with stufﬁng, cram your-
self with cranberry sauce and enjoy your holiday.

Mullins said the state wants
to respect the UniVersity’s pri-
vacy because of the research Pitt
does. He said that information
about the research Pitt conducts
should not be open to the public,
in case a private company were to
take ideas and make them their
own.

“That’s one of the major fac-

' tors that we recognize that makes

Pitt stand out nationally as an
institution,” he said. «

“We are going to try our best
to keep that in mind to respect
that mission.” V _

Arneson said that there can
always be an exemption writ-
ten for research, though details
on the potential law are not yet
available.

He said that Pileggi would also
like to see campus police forces’

The F.li'1al7‘urnace

activity become more transpar-

ent to the public. As of right now,
campus police are not required to
submit any records or informa-
tion to the public.

Pileggi is currently looking
into Blake’s proposal and is open
to “having a discussion” on it.

“The events that have trans-
pired recently have put a whole
new light on the  law,” Arneson
said.

Mullins said that Blake is

looking forward to meeting with V

legislative leaders in order to dis-
cuss the proposal. No time has
been established for the meet-
ing.

“We are optimistic that the

' senate state-government com-

mittee will have a public hearing
[to discuss reforms],” Arneson
said.

EDITORIAL

The Pitt News
gives thanks

In the spirit of Thanksgiving, it’s
healthy to discuss the things you’re
thankful for, and that is something
The Pitt News rarely attempts. As
bitter youths, our editorials are
typically critical —— but the time
has come for us to give thanks.
And there are quite a few compel-
ling gems that restore our faith in
this wonderful institution:

Only an 8.5 percent tuition
increase

Hey, it could be worse. Both
in- and out-of-state students only
have to cough up about $1,000
extra this term. And lifting the
wage freezes off Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg and several other ad-
ministrators’ earnings was a well-
spent $150,000. Padding already-
high salaries is a small cost for
big-time comfort of the high and
mighty. It’s not like that money
could be better spent improving
University facilities or anything.

Not letting club sports teams
use facilities '

It just makes sense. Club sports
teams simply don’t have the clout,
respect or talent needed to com-
pete on sports ﬁelds the “real” col-
lege athletes use. So what if part
of the Student Activity Fee goes
to club sports transportation to
off-campus ﬁelds? It’s a small price
to pay to keep the lesser athletes
off the real ﬁelds.

Pitt’s extreme gratitude

Thanks, Pitt, for receiving your
biggest donation ever and thank-

ing Mr. William S. Dietrich II with
a 10-story banner on the Fifth Av-
enue side of the Cathedral, even
though it ultimately fell down.
Carnegie Mellon not only got more
money but also had a ﬁreworks
show. We love ﬁreworks shows,
but banners are cool, too.

A high-octane football sea-
son

From the start, we weren’t sure
what a high-octane offense would

entail. Apparently it means a me- 1

diocre passing game, terrible line
protection and poor game-clock
management. But there’s nothing
like a Pitt football tradition: All
thishas led to sarcastic “High—
octane!” chants whenever Tino
Sunseri is sacked. Which is a lot.
We like to yell things, so we are
thankful.

A choke in November

We continue our sports-related
thankfulness by addressing the
adored men’s basketball team.
By losing pretty badly to lowly
Long Beach State, the team has
disappointed its fans a whole four
months earlier than normal. But
good news: Losing to a less-than-
stellar team squelches expecta-
tions early enough to prevent
disappointment later on in the
season.

But seriously.

At least we’re not Penn State.
What more could we be thankful
for? Have a high-octane Thanks-
givingBreak. I

OK, I’ll concede thatlast point. But

he presided over a program where

Research study bolsters gateway drug theory  

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
Columnist

 

Claiming alcohol and nicotine are
gateway drugs seems like a health-
class scare tactic. But a new Co-
lumbia University—led study lends
credibility to this notion. No, your
teacher was’n’t bluﬂing; you should
consider this. -

Lest youstop reading upon hear-
ing the-phrase “new study,” let me-
say ﬁrst that one person leading the
study, Eric Kandel, is a neuropsy—
chiatristwho won the Nobel Prize

’  Physiology or Medicine in 2000

"digmatic work on the
memory. He is also

 

the author of Principles of Neural -

3

,Science,’,'the almanac for any seri-
ous neuroscientist.Amir Levine, a
neuroscientist and psychiatrist also
led the study. h '

The initial investigation began

with an analysis by Kandel’s wife, De- j

nise Kandel, published in “Science”
in 1975. It detailed the alarming cor-
relation between adolescent use of
legal drugs and the subsequent use
of illicit drugs. Drinking alcohol or
smoking cigarettes, it said, is indica-
tive of marijuana use, which in turn
predicts use of drugs like cocaine
and heroin. “

_The theory was controversial at
the time, but now it has solid sup-
port. In .today’s language, that means-

. a chemical process has been identi-

ﬁed. The new study, published in

“Science Translational Medicine”

this month, describes the mecha-
nism responsible forthe correlation
between nicotine and cocaine use.
You might have heard of the
brain’s reward center, an evolution-
arily important survival mechanism.
The area triggers rewarding sensa-
tions for life—sustaining behaviors
like eating and drinking. This is the
area commonly affected by drugs,

which hijack the brain’s reward cycle
for less-healthy behavior.
The area contains the nucleus

* accumbens (NAcc), which receives

rewarding input from neurons in the
ventral tegmental area (VTA), which
secretes dopamine. Dopamine from
the VTA reinforces behaviors, and
the NAcc in turn sends inhibitory
feedback to the VTA. This can be
seen as a check to make sure the
cycle doesn’t become exacerbated,
leading to addiction.

Drugs like nicotine enhance do-
pamine release from the VTA to the
NAcc, and inhibit the NAcc’s regu-
latory feedback to the VTA. This
means the reward cyclecan run
into overdrive,. and thus over time
neurons can become acclimated to
receiving large, effective doses of
dopamine. _

The authors of the study admin-

- istered nicotine and cocaine to mice

and analyzed their resulting behav-
ior. They discovered that nicotine
primes the reward center such that
the response to cocaine is greater

than that in anormal “non-smoker” '

mouse. Addiction was measured
by the level of addiction-related
behaviors exhibited after cocaine
administration. Conversely, cocaine
did not enhance mice’s response to
nicotine.

The model is relevant to us be-
cause of shared brain morphology
—— both humans and mice have a
reward center. In both mice and

men, as well, the aforementioned .

enhancement only works if nicotine
use precedes cocaine use. The epide-
miology concurs. In adult humans,
90.4 percent of those between ages
18 and 34 have smoked cigarettes
before using cocaine. Conversely, 2.4
percent of the same group uses co-
caine ﬁrst, according to the study.
Now for some molecular biology.
The priming and enhancement of
nicotine use is because of a number
of cellular changes. DNA is usually

wound up around spherical protein
masses called histones. It is thus
inaccessible for reading and pro-

tein production. Acetylation of the ,

histones is a chemical process that
frees up DNA for reading. Histone
deacetylase is an enzyme that re-
verses this reaction, so DNA stays
wound up. Nicotine acts-by inhibit-
ing this enzyme, and thus allowing
the DNA of neurons in the reward
center to become accessible.

The gene or part of DNA that
nicotine opens for reading is the
FosB gene, which helps create FosB
protein. FosB protein is critical in
cocaine’s ability to cause addiction.
Administering nicotine before co-
caine produces a level of this protein
that ampliﬁes cocaine’s effects. Con-
sequently, cocaine can more readily
enhance dopamine activity in the
reward center, increasing the po-

_ tential for addiction.

Alan Sved, a neuroscientist and
department chair of Neuroscience
at Pitt, had some words to share on
the matter. “This work is related to
research at Pitt by [our lab] that has
shown that administering nicotine
to rats markedly enhances the re-

warding properties of other stimuli ’

provided to the rats. An extension
of this work would be that nicotine
treatment would enhance the re-
warding qualities of cocaine, which
is what Levine and colleagues de-
scribe in their mice.” So nicotine,
as an enhancer of many effects, is a
chemical of particular importance.

One might ask why knowing the
molecularunderpinning of thisphe-
nomenon is important. The reasons
are manifold. Before this work, for
one thing, studies supporting the
gateway drug theory could more
readily be dismissed as statistical
wand-waving. Now we have a real
biological framework to support the
theory, proteins and all.

Another reason is the implica-
tions it has for our current practices.

Smokers tryingto quit are prescribed
a source of nicotine that does not
harm their lungs —— either dermal
patches or chewing gum. However,
if nicotine makes cocaine addiction
more likely, is “safe” nicotine really
the best answerfor quitters? It might
decrease the risk of lung cancer, but
not cocaine addiction.

As this mechanism becomes bet-
ter understood, it’ll come as no sur-
prise if Big Pharma tries to capitalize
on it. In fact, the researchers have
already proposed a drug: a com-
pound that could activate histone
deacetylase enzyme to put the DNA
out of commission, competing with
nicotine’s effects. Would taking this
compound in some form, perhaps
through the same cigarette one is
smoking, be the best idea? It dimin-
ishes nicotine’s gateway ability and
also makes smoking safer if cocaine
addiction is a worry.

Last week was Tobacco Aware-
ness Week, during which partici-
pants urged the president to share
compassionate words with those
trying to quit. I didn’t think it could
be done, but we now ofﬁcially have
another reason to discourage smok-
ing. Although the study didn’t focus

on alcohol’s effect, alcohol works ‘

its magic in the same brain center.
We should probably stand by for
another study.

When bodily mechanisms be-
come common knowledge, many
sectors will have a stake in it. The
medical and pharmaceutical in-
dustries both stand to beneﬁt. This
knowledge then meets the public
in the form of medical procedures
and drug advertisements. How-
ever, it will always beﬁt us to look
at the original studies behind these
therapies, as we can then begin to
understand not just their beneﬁts,
but also their risks and larger im-
plications.

By Sarah Simkin
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Marion “Tank” LaFleur, the recep-
tionist at Newell—Simon Hall, greets
visitors, jokes around with them and
watches their movements with un-
nerving concentration. Tank, as he
prefers to be called, is not a typical
receptionist, but a “Roboceptionist”
at Carnegie Mellon University.

Tank sports a digital screen for a
head, displaying animated facial ex-

pressionsontopofabodyal<intq,‘7Sta/gr

threateningly to tell people to use his
nickname instead of “Marion.”.

He’s also quick to remind visitors,
“The nexttime your computer doesn’t
work, don’t hit it. We have feelings
too!” It’s a reminder that Tank has a
more anthropomorphic personality
than We’re used to from the artiﬁcial
intelligence we interact with daily.
Pandora,,predicts. what you’cl liketo
 Roomba navigates your
livingroomtovacuum-—butTankcan
socialize with you.

Tank represents a new frontierfor
AI — social artiﬁcial intelligence.

Ph.D. student Heather Knight, who
works with Reid Simmons, Tank’s
progenitor, at CMU, envisions a ﬂi-
ture where machines are capable of
interacting with humans on a social
level.

“We want to add somethingextra,
add entertainment. We want to make
not justan operatingsystem with util-
ity, but one that makes you feel good,
that makes life better,” she said.

And though we don’t all have at-
tentive robots like Tank -— nicknamed
the “Creeperbot” by those who ﬁnd
his ever-vigilant eyes unsettling——we
might still interactvvith social artiﬁcial
intelligence that’s sitting in our pock-
ets. Siri is a personal-assistant appli-
cation launched as an integrated part
of iOS 5 for the iPhone 4S in October.
Though its voice still rings with a cer-
tain technological monotone, Siri uses
natural language to answer questions,

make recommendations and perform .

tasks. It adapts to individual prefer-
ences over time and personalizes its
services.

“It works amazingly well. In the
future, I hope we see proactive sys-
tems that can support our needs but
that can also be sensitive to the social
setting,” associate professor ofhuman-

Forlizzi said.
Knightsaid that successful human
encounters involve social etiquette
that comes second—nature to us, like
knowing which side of a hallway to
walk down or the way we use nonver-
bal signals for tasks like ﬁguring out
who goes throughadoorwayﬁrst.'I‘his
ﬂuid interpersonalsocialization makes

chines more useful. How do we com-
municate with each other in the ﬁrst
place?” Knight said.

Knight said one of her robots has
been “dabbling in comedy.” Data —
named for a character from “Star
Trek” — can aggregate the sounds
of laughter, applause and booing and
then adjust his joke-telling routine
accordingly. Last December, during
Data’s debut at a TED talk — a Tech-
nology Entertainment and‘ Design
rnini—presentation that can be found
onwww.ted.org—Knightasked audi-
ence members to hold up green panels
after jokes they liked and red panels
after jokes they didn’t. This allowed
Data to interpret the visual informa-
tion and choose hisnext joke fromhis
internal database. Knight said that,
over time, Data can adjust to differ-
ent audiences’ tastes, similar to the
way Netﬂix adjusts its viewer recom-

. mendations.

“Comedy acts have the opportunity
to be more dynamicthanscripted plays
and give the robot the opportunity to
change direction based on how people
are respon ' g,” she said.

This provides a litmus test of how
well the application can gauge social
cues. Knight believes thatﬁndingways
for people and robots to interact suc-
cessfully will lead to smoother inter-
faces. She views artiﬁcial intelligence
research as “empowering humanity
through machines. I think about how
[we can] make people enjoy life more
or be able to prosper, howwe can cre-
ate caretakers or tools that are more
fun to use.”

These humanoid robots are easier
for people to identify with and con-
sequently work with more effectively
—— up to a point. When robots start to
resemble people too much, research-
ers have found a sharp dip — known
as the uncanny valley — in how much
people like them.

Classic examples of technology
creeping toward the uncarmy valley
are the android robots built by_Iapa-
nese researcherHiroshi Ishiguro. For-
lizzi described the robots, complete
with facial movements and simulated
breathing, as “frighteningly real hu-
manoid systems.” Forlizzi said that
in one test, where participants were

. brieﬂy exposed to Ishiguro next to

the robot replica he built of himself,
participants were unable to tell them
apart. A

This means that researchers must
gauge ‘whether or not a human user
will feel comfortable with the robots
to ensure that they’re helpﬁil. Knight
said that the goal of her research was
to enable humans and machines to
do things together rather than to dis-
place humanity. She gave the example
of robots assisting the elderly to live

‘ at home and maintain their indepen-

dence longer, which would enhance
their personal freedom and quality
of life. But Forlizzi stresses that this
teclmology won’t replace humans.

“I do not think a robot could ever
replace a human caregiver —— only
augment what they do so human
assistance can be available for more
people,” Forlizzi said.

Anotherway artiﬁcial-intelligence
enhanced tools can supplement hu-
man work is as classroom aids.janet
Schoﬁeld researches the effects of
computers on classroom social pro-
cesses.

“As AI becomes more advanced, I
expectitwillbeableto contribute more
and more to instruc1ion,'especially
in certain domains where ‘right’ and
‘wrong’ answers are clear and the com-
mon paths to right and wrong answers
are understood,” the Pitt psychology
professor said'in an email.

Schoﬁeld said that a geometry-
tutoring program she studied in high
school classrooms increased students’
motivation and promoted friendly
competition between students. It
also allowed students to progress at
their own paceto agreater extentthan
traditional instructional methods. The
program, which adapts its content to
its users, frees up teachers’ time to fo-
cus on other educational areas.

It’s these sorts of programs that
artiﬁcial intelligence enables. We’re
already adapting to Siri’s sweetly hu-
man-like responses to our requests for
help, and it remains to be seen what
technology will integrate itself into
our lives next. I

up over similar. locales, there
will need to be a certain dis-
tinct quality that sets it apart.
Fortunately, it seems that The
Porch is trying to capture a sort
of homemade,‘ gourmet appeal
by crafting comforting ﬂavors

with interesting ingredients and '

supplyingas many homemade
edibles as possible. '

It gives the food and restau-
rant a quaint, French—country—
_side charm. As soon as guests

ofproduce like as j a 

walk in, they’re greeted by
friendly and knowledgeable staff
who assist in picking and pairing
options throughout the meal.
From drinks to desserts, the
items are a spot-on mixture of
the familiar and the novel. The
place prides itself on making

homemade soda regularly and

the blueberry-ginger is the per-
fect combination of refreshing
ﬂavors with just a hint of sweet-
ness — similar to a blueberry.
Even much—loved foods get
an update. "The
crispy taters
are a modern
version of Tater

fries, potato‘es

curried ketch-

features the
spiciness of
jalapenos. It’s
not so untradi—
tional as to be
considered too
far out for the
average college palate.

Mixing gourmet and homey
is a common theme throughout
the entrees as well - even if
the course does come out a bit
too quickly. From pizza to duck,
the platters can please the most
picky to those with mildly -ad-
venturous palates. Though one
of the pizzas sports goat cheese,
arugula and fig jam, it’s still a
delectable mix of salty and sweet
atop fresh, airy pizza dough. It’s

Tots or 

the right amount of experi-
mentation to interest the
Oakland community without
alienating its taste buds.

While the food might be
delicious, the decor leaves
something to be desired.
With white walls and a wide-
open floor plan, the interior ~
is charmingly reminiscent
of a barn. Unfortunately,
the open space has few
sound-absorbing qualities
and few barriers, making
for a loud and very public
dining area.

But there’s something to
look forward to: wide win-
dows that can be opened in
the spring and summertime
and light shades of green
that give the place an or-
ganic feel. It’s perfect for
a central location in a park
area, the idea being building
to keep the natural setting
present. There seem few bar-
riers between the grass and
the restaurant’s floor.

- It remains to be seen
what The Porch will
do, as it’s currently
jumping off the
springboard
of a trendy,
green eat-
ery. If the -
owners find
their niche,
then Schen-
ley Plaza
might join
the legions
of South Oak-
land spaces
with ’ well-
loved porch-
es. I

MOVIE REVIEW

“The lVluppets”reur1ior1 hardly remarkable, rivetirig”

By Kirstin‘ Kennedy
Staﬂ’ Writer

“The Muppets”

Directed by: James Bobin
Starring: Jason Segel, Amy
Adam,s,.Chris Cooper, Kermit
the Frog and Miss Piggy

Grade: B

Kermit the Frog, his estranged wife
Miss Piggy and the rest of the Mup-
pet mob have gathered once again.
“The Muppets,” the ﬁrst ﬁlm.fe_a-

turingjim Henson’s characters in

12 years, incorporates everything
that you would expect of the clas-
sic show —.— cheesy punch lines,
slapstick humor, blatant irony and
a nostalgic reunion. I

Gary (Jason Segel) and his pup-
pet brother Walter, voiced by Peter
Linz, live in a Small Town America,
Main Street type of town where
they share a house, a bedroom and
matching pajamas. In the opening
scene, the brothers initiate a song
sequence full of singing, swinging
and even tap dancing. Although
Segel doesn’t have the‘ promise of

becoming the next Gene Kelly, his
cheerful voice and enthusiasm set
the tone for the characters’ perfect
world.

Gary and his brother are Mup-
pet enthusiasts. Walter, Kermit’s
number-one fan, longs to meet
his idol and the rest of the mup-
pets. When Gary and his girlfriend
Mary (Amy Adams), plan to take a
celebratory 10-year—anniversary
trip, Walter is invited along with
promises of touring the old Mup-
pet theater and visiting Kermit’s
former ofﬁce. The ﬁlm’s beginning

is extremely whimsical with bright

While visiting the run-down
stage, Walter faces a conﬂict that
convinces him, Gary and Mary to
locate Kermit the Frog and reunite
the entire Muppet cast. Kermit ac-
cepts the subsequent invitation

element is an example of the tone
of irony that goes unnoticed by
children, but will certainly be wel-
comed by the adults in the audi- ‘
ence.

At this point, the movement of
the ﬁlm begins to feel very familiar
— almost too familiar. It makes
use of the same plot as every other

of “The Blues Brothers,” minus the

give purpose to the ﬁlm and the characters
are so fantastical that it’s hard to retain an

the family over Thanksgiving Break, but not
much more. I

“Twilight: Breaking Dawn -— Part I”
Directed By: Bill Condon

Starring: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattin-
son, Taylor Lautner

Grade: A-

Bill Condon’s “Twilight: Breaking Dawn —

, Part I,” based on the ﬁnal novel of Stephenie

Meyer’s “Twilight Saga,” has ﬁnally arrived.
Every “Twilight” fan has waited with bated
breath, but can the movie supply enjoyment
for even those who haven’t read the book or
kept up with the ﬁlms?

Unfortunately, it- can’t._ _A s,ign'iﬁc__ant
drawback concerns moviegoer_.s_w-h_g,,a  A

In this installment, Bella (Kristen Stew-

art) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) get mar-. V

ried and suddenly ﬁnd themselves preparing
for the arrival of a baby. Meanwhile, the
Quileute werewolves and the Volturi vam-

-pires plan to eliminate the unborn child, who

poses a potential threat to all of them.

The storyline depends heavily on the as-
sumption that the audience has followed the
story from its very beginning. For a causal

the ﬁrst three “Twilight” movies beforehand
is advised. To appreciate the ﬁrst half of the
ﬁrst installment of “Breaking Dawn,” it’s
necessary to see the preceding movies.
The intense graphics provide captivating
visuals to accompany the complex plot. To
balance the aesthetic beauty of the ﬁlm,
Condon carefully crafts scenes of intense
action. The conflict between the werewolves
and vampires escalates, and werewolfjacob
(Taylor Lautner) turns against his own fam-
ily to save Bella.

The three main characters, Bella, Jacob ' I
and Edward, have developed considerably‘

since the ﬁrst movie —— the relationship

between them has matured. Edward‘ grows ‘

to appreciate the special relationship Ja-
ns acti“ ’ ~‘

ationally approp_riatef  §tewart siictlonv
has improved. She’s"’ﬁnally eliminated the

awkwardness of her character ‘and really 
learned how to present Bella on an authentic Q”

and relatable platform. Lautner moved from
being the movie’s eye candy to becoming a

character with substance. There is suddenly 1 -
a notable, intense passion driving his char— 
acter; his emotions_don’t seem fabricated, 1
but instead, they come across as real as this .

fantasy world permits.

Condon does an excellent job exploring '
, themes of marriage, love and pregnancy in :

the movie via sporadic vivid dreams and

hallucinations. A remarkable point he pro—*

ﬁciently conveys is Bella and Edward’s 11131",
riage before any attempt to have children.
This is in shocking contrast to programs on
television like MTV’s “Teen Mom” and “16
and Pregnant;” the media shows us plenty
of babies, but rarely love or real commit-
ment.

 

for Twilight series

Overall, “Breaking Dawn — Part 1” is
excellent, especially if you are looking for
love, hate, action and even a little comedy.
By keeping the audience on edge with several
suspenseful moments, the movie created a
powerful andithrilling atmosphere —~ a good
way to attract viewers for the coming Part
2. The movie is a must—see; it will urge you
to see the second installment and maybe
even rewatch the ﬁrst three movies of the
Twilight saga. I

East loss as it defeated the_‘Car-

on Oct. 23.

. For Wynn and Leggs, it seemed
as if the Louisville team entered
the Big East tournament match-
up improved and ready to face
the Panthers again.

“We were their only confer-
ence loss, and it was apparent
that they were out to get revenge
and that they would be focused

1 on that goal,” Wynn said. -

“Louisville’s defense was much
improved this “time around,”

Leggs said. “They did not let

anything hit the floor.”

In the first set, the‘Panthers
battled the Cardinals to a 15-12
score, but a 10-1 run by Louisville
sealedthe victory.

The Panthers managed their
first lead in the second set of

. the match as they broke a 12-12
tie on a kill by Leggs. The score-

remained close and at the 22-20
mark, but the Cardinals called a
timeout and returnedto end the
set on three straight points.

- Pitt head coach Toby Rens-

acknowledged that his team did
not execute its game plan as ef-
fectively as it had in the October
meeting.

ﬁrst round of the Aztec Turkey Time Invitational.

“Our focus was on limiting

. their runs and attacking their

game plan to put them out of
system,”_Rens said. “We were un-
able to do that, and to Louisville’s
credit, they responded well to
our attempts.”

The third set began with the‘

Panthers jumping out to an 11-7
lead, but once again the Cardinals

used a run -—- this time 8-0 —to a

take the 23-22 edge. But the Pan-
thers were able to close out the
set on a block from sophomore
Brenea White.

In the match, the Panthers
ou.t—blocked the Cardinals 15-4
and recorded 5 blocks in the third
set while shutting out their op-
ponent in that category.

Louisville took advantage of
its match-high 17 kills in the ﬁnal
set to defeat the Panthers and
advance to the next round of the
conference tournament.

' The Cardinals’ success on
offense came through balanced
scoring, as four players recorded

double-digit kills en route to out-

hitting the Panthers 62-38."

For Rens, the lack of scoring’

distribution was a critical part
of the loss. a

“We would have liked to get our
outside hitters more involved,”
Rens said. “Kiesha had to carry
a large -burden from the middle
position since we struggled with
our other offensive options.” .

Louisville junior outside hit-
ter Lola Arslanbekova, recently
named Big East Player of the Year,
led all players with 16 kills. Her

_ 4.94 kil1s—per-set average cur-

rently ranks third in the nation,

and she has tallied over 1,400 -

kills in her three—year career. _ V

The Cardinals also dominated
in defense and serving statistics
as they recorded 75 digs and 11
service aces, whereas-the Pan-
thers tallied 59 and four, respec-
tively.

BREAKDOWN

Kelly Flanigan
Sta_ﬂ"Wri ter

Here’s a breakdown of matchups
happening over Thanksgiving
Break.

Football: 4’

At 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov."25' the;
Panthers (5-5, 3-2 Big East) will face
- off against the West Virginia Moun-

taineers (7-3, 3-2 Big East) in the
104“‘ Backyard Brawl. The game will
be nationally televised on ESPN.

Head coach Todd Graham’s Pan-
thers will enter the game off a bye

2 week. They recently defeated the
Louisville Cardinals 21-14 in their
ﬁrst road win of the season.

The importance of this year's
Backyard Brawl has increased in
light of Cincinnati’s loss to Rutgers
University on Saturday. Combined
with West Virginia’s victory over C_in-
cinnati, the upset means the race for
the Big East title has opened up and
a concrete picture of a front-runner
has yet to surface.

Now three teams in the Big East
have two losses: Pitt, West Virginia
and Cincinnati. Cincinnati has de-
feated the Panthers, but West Vir-
ginia has defeated Cincinnati.

Essentially, whichever team loses
the Backyard Brawl also relinquishes

ship. .
Given the Panthers’ dismal road
record, the heated rivalry and the

Puskar Stadium will pose to the Pan-
thers, the team will need to remain
focused on Friday evening.

Shutting down the superior
throwing ability of Mountaineer
quarterback Geno Smith will be at
the top of the Panthers’ list of con-
cerns. Westvirginia does notrunthe
ball much, and its possession time is
among the lowest in the cenferenee.
With the West Virginia defense on
the ﬁeld the majority of the game,
Pitt will need to take care to limit its
turnovers on the offensive end, and
that starts with quarterback Tino
Sunseri playing solidly.

The previously ninth-ranked
Panthers (2-1) are likely to fall out
of the rankings after losing 86-76
to unranked opponent Long Beach
State last Wednesday. The loss
marked the team’s ﬁrst to a non-

On Tuesday, Nov. 22' the men’s
team will take on the La Salle Explor-
ers of Philadelphia. Tipolf is set for7
p.m. at the Petersen ENentsVCenter.

Seniors Ashton Gibbs and Nasir
Robinson have stepped up as the
team’s major scoringthreats so far
this season, ayeragmg21.7 and 16.3
points, respectively. Gibbs’ partner
in the backcourt, redshirt junior 'I‘z‘i‘—
von Woodall, averages 19.7 points
per game.

Coachjamie Dixoncontinues to
utilize a deep bench composed of
nine players, several of whom are
freshmen. The 3-point shooting of
guardjohnjohnson and dominance
on the boards of forward Khem
Birch have made early impacts for
the Panthers.

uted four aces. Wynn’s 19 digs paced
the Panthers defense while freshman

Delaney Clesen chipped in with 15.

While the Panthers exited the tournament
earlier than they
had hoped, both
players and coaches
were able to ‘see the
positive aspects of
the season.

Leggs earned
first team All-Big

award that she at-

tion she put into her
senior season. _

“I was shocked
at first, especially
given the level of
talent in the conference,” Leggs said. “It
is. nice though, to be recognized for my
efforts,”

Rens was not surprised with the distinc— '
tion and noted that he has been impressed ,

with Leggs’ performances this season.

“Kiesha has been instrumental to our
team, both in terms of her offensive'pro-
duction and her leadership on and off the
court,” Rens said. “She is truly deserving
of this honor and I am certainly proud
of her.”

Wynn, a freshman, is confident that
the team will take the results of this
season and learn from the experience

“At one point
in the -Louisville
match, we had five
freshmen on the
court and only one

Wynn said. “Hav-

SWIMMING AND DIVING

Panthers perform well at
home in Pitt Invitational

Dexter Gulick
Staff Writer

Pitt’s swimming and diving teams protect-
ed their home turf this weekend, earning
three, in-conference wins on their way to
ﬁrst and second place ﬁnishes in the Pitt
Invitational. _

Six teams attended this weekend’s Pitt
Invitational: West Virginia, Connecticut,
Cincinnati, Michigan and Ohio State. By
the time Sunday evening -ended, the men’s
team (6-3, 4-2 Big East) had- ﬁnished ﬁrst,
collecting four wins for the Panthers’ record.
The men ﬁnished with a ﬁnal score of 1148,
with their closest competitor, West Virginia,
ﬁnishing with 1009.

A The women (_6—4, 4-2 Big East), who
ﬁnished with 770 points, placed second
between an undefeated Ohio State (1,313)
and Big East rival West Virginia (714.5). The
effort added four wins and one loss to their
record. . ‘

The one droppedmatchup was inconse-

quential in comparison to the victories, as ‘I

both the men’s and women’s teams gained
three in—conference wins. Their single loss
came at the hands of Ohio State University’s

' women’s swim and dive team — a program

that ranks thirteenth in the nation.
“Comparatively, we’re not nearly as
strong as they are,” head coach Chuck
Knoles said before the ﬁnals on Sunday.
“We had some girls that were able to com-
pete head-to-head with them; They’re a very

well-coached team. They-have a great his- 5

tory in the last four to ﬁve years as being a
nationally ranked team. Certainly, having
a Big Ten team here has given quite a bit of
prestige to the meet, too.”

The Pitt Invitational spanned the week-
end, with races on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. Each day included a preliminary
swim, during which all who entered raced td
compete for a seed time later in the evening.
Based on their performances, swimmers
were placed into one of three possible ﬁnals
heats — championship ﬁnals, consolation
ﬁnals or bonus ﬁnals. Only the participants
in the ﬁrst two heats would record points
for their teams. -

USA Swimming — the national governing
body of competitive swimming in the United
States — presided over the meet. Their pres-
ence made all times oflicially recognized on a
national level. Preliminary races were swum

in long-course meters, races with 50-meter

lengths, and the ﬁnals were swum in short-
course yards, races with 25-yard lengths.
“We were tipping our hats to the fact

that this is an Olympic year, and it gives

some of these kids a chance to swim — in
the morning — long course,” Knoles said.

.“They can make some Olympic trial cuts,
 but then comeback at night and swim in

collegiate yards.”

Freshman Luke Nosbisch recorded the
fastest seed time in both the 100—meter and
200—meter breaststroke, but fell to third
in the 100-yard breaststroke ﬁnals with "a
time of 56.72. His seed time from the long-
course meters was 1:05.39, which was 0.6
seconds longer than a time that would have
given him the opportunity to participate in
the U.S. Olympic Trials. But the freshman
remained humble after the event. '

“I think I did okay. Not amazing, but I
did all right,” Nosbisch said.

Nosbisch also held down the breaststroke
leg of the men’s 200-meter medley relay,
recording the fastest split of any of the Pitt
breaststrokers in the ﬁnals. Even then, he
had reservations about his ﬁrst placement
in an “A” relay that went on to win the event

- in ﬁnals. . i
“I felt like I shouldn’t have been put in .

there,” Nosbisch said. “Ben Solari, Pierre
Meunier and Rob Power, they’re better than
me in the 50 by far. My event’s mainly the
2oo.” .

While Nosbisch did not register an Olym-
pic Trial or NCAA “B” cut—time -— which

' would have qualiﬁed him for a meet fea-
.turing the NCAA’s elite — others in that

relay did. Pitt backstroker Adam Maczewski
pulled out a B cut with a time of 47.76 in
the 100—yard backstroke. His preliminary
time, a 57.60 in the 100-meter back, was
0.01 seconds shy of earning what would

have beenan Olympic Trial cut. Butterﬂyer ‘

Kourosh Ahani came in second in the 100-
yard ﬂy ﬁnals with a 48.12, which netted
him an NCAA Bcut in the process. Anchor
Jake Van Roekel took the 200-yard freestyle
with a time of 1:40.36. _

Maczewski, Ahani and Van Roekel com-
bined with breaststroker Solari to win the
men’s 400-yard medley relay with a time of
3:16.87, securing a B cut by nearly a second.
The men’s 800-yard freestyle relay — with
Van Roekel,»Alexander Rodenkirk, Jon Lier—
ley and Morne Boshoﬂ°+ also attained a “B”
cut with a time of _6:39.55. They were just
a few seconds away from being the fastest
800-yard relay in the Big East.

' But the biggest individual performance in
the meet came from freshman Cam Dixon of
the women’s team. In every event she swam
in, Dixon produced a seed time worthy of a
championship—ﬁnal heat. Her efforts earned
the Pitt women’s team 43 points in her in-
dividual events. An additional 142 points
were earned through her participation in
various relays.

Dixon ﬁnished fourth in the 200-yard in-
dividual medley with 2:02.99, just a second
from a B cut. She likewise missed the cutoff
in the 100-yard breaststroke by roughly half
a second, ﬁnishing at 1:03.45. .
