For The Pitt News

When Nev Schulman found
himself in the middle of a fake
online relationship, he could
have either been embarrassed
and receded into a dark -corner
or have made a documentary
chroniclingvhis situation for
the world to watch. He chose
the latter. ‘

“The most embarrassing
thing to ever happen to me
turned into the most success-
ful thing to ever happen to me,”
Schulman said. '

Schulman, along with his
older brother,Rel and friend
Henry Joost, created the 2010
indie documentary “Catfish,”
which became an instant hit at
the Sundance Film Festival. The
success would translate into a
popular MTV reality docudrama,
“Catﬁsh: The TV Show,”Vwhich
aired last fall. A

Schulman, 28, stopped by
the William Pitt Union on Sun-
day night to speak to about 200
people at Pitt Program Council’s
sold—out event, “An Evening with

A Nev Schulman: Catﬁsh On Cam-

pus.” Schulman’s presentation,
titled “My Uneverse,” offered
advice on various categories of
life, from ﬁnding success in ca-
reers to using social networking
appropriately. "
Approaching the micro-
phone, Schulman declared to the
crowd that he would be breaking

the previously PPC-advised “no camera
rule” by allowing students to take his
picture, a statement which was greeted
by countless camera flashes. Facing the
numerous ﬂashes of cameras, he shared
his advice with the crowd.

“Be brutally honest with yourse_lf,”
Schulman said, “and find people who are-
willing to do the same.”

To “catfish” is to create a fake on-
line persona through the use of social
media and to pursue romance using the
fraudulent-identity. Schulman, who is a
New York-based photographer, became
involved in an online affair in which the
woman hadbeen catﬁshing him the entire
time. The documentary “Catfish,” follows
Nev Schulman’s experience through the
deceit and heartbreak that sometimes

. accompanies online dating.

Schulman’s successful TV show, on
the other hand, chronicles the lives of
young menand women who have online

relationships and reach out to Schulman .

While waiting for Schulman’s arrival,
a large screen on stage displayed Tweet-

in the Assembly Room to tweet at Schul-
man’s account or to the hashtag “#ca-t—

marriage proposals to chest—hair—shaving
suggestions — Schulman is known for
showcasing his extremely hairy chest
on the show. { .
The popularity and controversy of
the show — the result of accusations
regarding its authenticity —— attracted
members of the Pitt Program Council who
decided on Schulman’s visit. Beth Hill, a
senior psychology major and director of
the Lecture Committee of.fPPC, said the
choice of selecting Schulman to visit was
a simple one.

high—profile groups such as Occupy Pitt,
the campus offshoot of the national Oc-
cupy Movement, struggle to find the same
kind of cohesion that was so prevalent
during that bygone era. Former members
of Occupy Pitt say realities of the present-
day social activism hindered the group’s
expansion and power.

Last February, Occupy Pittsburgh
ended its occupation of Mellon Green in
Downtown after BNY Mellon, the own-
ers of the park, ﬁled an eviction notice
against the Occupiers. Occupy Pitt con-
tinued its efforts on campus, but its for-
mer members say it couldn’t replicate
the successes of groups such as the Black
Action Society in the _late 1960s.

Meredith McNair, one of the founding
members of Occupy Pitt and an urban
studies major, said the group aimed to
extend the Occupy Movement to Pitt’s
campus to address issues such as the cost
of text books and locally rising tuition.
The group, which fluctuated in member-
ship but maintained about 10 core mem-
bers, aimed to create a visible display
on campus but met different challenges.
_Chief among their challenges were the
more than 100 bomb threats from last
spring that disrupted campus.

“We wanted to build something like
a Hooverville type of a thing around the
Cathedral,” McNair said, “but we thought
any anti-University protests ‘or mani-
festations would almost relate us to the
bomb threats in a negative way.’’ i

Hoovervilles were encampments made
by citizens who became homeless as a re-
sult of the Great Depression in the 1930s.
Their name refers to President Herbert

‘Hoover, who presided over the stock mar-

ket crash in 1929. .

Senior Ryan Branagan, a former mem-
ber of the group, said the issues that were
important to students in the 1960s were
more distinct and recognizable.

“There are different issues facing our
generation,” Branagan said. “Back then,
there was a very strong anti-war move-

ment, civil rights movement and freedom

of speech issues.” ‘

As an offshoot of Occupy Pittsburgh
and the national Occupy Wall Street
movement, Branagan said the goal of
Occupy Pitt revolved around the afford-
ability. of higher educationin the state of
Pennsylvania. He said the group focuses
on preventing the privatization of‘Pitt
by spreading information regarding the
cut in state allocations to Pitt and other
publicluniverslities in Pennsylvania..

-  re ..  - - ,
g ‘*  ‘ '  E2»

But, Branagan admitted, the multi-
tude of issues confronted by Occupy Pitt
and the national Occupy Movement often
distorted their overall message; Brana-
gan said he’d attend meetings for Occupy
Pittsburgh and that arguments between

the group’s different factions — including ‘

socialists, anarchists and moderates —
prevented them from achieving tangible
results. .“ V

In addition to the group’s structural
issues, Branagan said the proliferation
of social media also negatively affected
the group. He said—Facebook and Twit-
ter served as a “double—edged sword”
because they made the sharing of ideas
more efficient, but also promoted limited
engagement among members.

“The best way you can go about it is
to use social media to prompt actual ac-
tion,” he said. _

Branagan is not alone in his views on
social media’s rolein contemporary social
activism.

In a 2010 article titled “Small Change”
by Malcolm Gladwell of The New Yorker,
Gladwell argues that websites such as
Facebook and Twitter make it relatively

simple for people to appear politically,

active by simply liking a page or retweet-
ing a link. .

Unlike the sit-ins of the Civil Rights
Movement, in which black college stu-
dents united with their friends to protest
against segregation in the South, Gladwell
said, social media thrives in an environ-
ment that necessitates a consensus but
fails in binding members to a single cause.

“Because networks don’t have a cen-
tralized leadership structure and clear
lines of authority, they have real difficulty
reaching consensus and setting goals,”
Gladwellsaid. “They can’t think stra-
tegically. They are chronically prone to

conflict and error. How do you'make dif- ,

ﬁcult decisions about tactics or strategy
or philosophical direction when everyone
has a say?” ‘

But McNair disagreed with Branagan
and Gladwell’s view of social media’s in-
fluence on socral movements. 9

“I think [social media] was only a posi-
tive,” she ‘said. “We were able to spread
the word about the movement through-
Facebook and share articles. When we
made national news, word spread easily
across socialmedia sites in an overall
positive and effective way.” A ,

Unlike the ‘Occupiers of today, Pitt
students from the late 1960s agreed on
the underlying causes of social activism
during that era: the war in Vietnam and

the Civil Rights Movement.

ACTIVISM

 

As a college student during the Viet-
nam War, Rabbi Joshua Chasan, who
graduated from Pitt with a doctorate in
American history in 1974 and is now a
professor of religious studies at St. Mi-
chael’s College in Vermont and a rabbi at

‘ Ohavi Zedek Synagogue in Burlington,

engaged in a variety of peaceful dem-
onstrations throughout his time at Pitt.

Chasan, who admitted in an email that
his memory of the era “was not great,”
said he participated in draft resistance
rallies and a sit—in on a variety of issues
and protested in favor of including Af-

_rican-Americans in the labor union that
built the U.S. Steel Building Downtown.

Chasan said conscription as a result of
the Vietnam War fueled social activism
at Pitt and on college campuses across
the country.

' “We were a generation that had grown
up comfortably, solid middle class and
upper middle class, and we had a great
sense of our own security, so we were
able to take stands even when there were
risks,” he said.

Although Chasan admitted that differ-
ences existed among social movements’
during his college career as much as they
do with the Occupy Movement, he said
the “bottom—up attempt at democracy”
by the Occupiers resembled that of the
anti—Vietnam protests. He said Occupy
needs to create a larger, national appeal.

“Our politics were part of a larger cul-
ture of peace and justice,” Chasan said.
“There was great social ferment. Occupy
still has to prove it can do that.”

Like Chasan, Joe Kociubes, a 1969
graduate of Pitt’s school of philosophy
who is now an attorney with the Bingham
McCutchen Law Firm in Boston, said the
Vietnam War polarized the student body
at Pitt. He said the activism began during
his time in high school with the election
between republican Richard’ Nixon and
democrat Barry Goldwater in 1964.

Kociubes said it’s difficult to pinpoint
one incident that deﬁned the era at Pitt,
but there was a sense of resolve and cohe-

sion about social and political issues and
being involved in them. '

“There was an extraordinary sense of

community and shared responsibility on
campus at the time,”\_Kociubes said, not-
ing that this includedthe faculty.

Paul Stoller’s experience at Pitt mir-

rored that of Kociubes and Chasan. As A

editor—in-chief of The Pitt News during
the 1968-1969 academic year, Stoller, an
anthropology professor at West Chester
University in West Chester, Pa., provided
a representative voice of the student body
at Pitt throughout the politically active
era.

Stoller said a culmination of factors
inﬂuenced the on-campus activism. He
said this included a visit from King before
his assassination, the Vietnam War, the

presidentialelection and controversy

over the FBI’s presence on campus.
During the late 1960s, the U.S. gov-
ernment placed FBI agents on college
campuses in order to monitor subversive
activities by students —- particularly ac-
tivities that undermined the Vietnam War
and the selective service that coincided

‘with it.

Stoller said writing editorials against
the war as well as participating in on-
campus activism “honed me for the rest
of my career.” He added that the activism
helped students form an identity for their
generation.

“The times really necessitated that
we made sure of what we were,” he said.

For members of Pitt’s ROTC during
the late 1960s, the turmoil on campus
presented a challenge to their views that
the U.S. government always served as a
force for good. V

Jack LaPietra, a Pitt graduate who
served as the spokesman for the Univer-
sity’s ROTC program in 1968, said that
in retrospect he wishes he would’ve re-
sponded to the protests against the ROTC
“1ess adversarially” than he had at the
time. He said incidents like the My Lai

Schulman explained that he found
success in life unconventionally and by
making plenty of mistakes first, includ-
ing getting kicked out of kindergarten,
middle school and college. He recounted
the odd jobs he had before becoming
famous, such as being the “king of the ‘
New York bar Mitzvah scene” as a pho-
tographer and ﬁlmmaker.

On ﬁnding success with his documen-

there is a common notion that people
must stay focused and out of trouble,
but he advises that we all must make our-
selves noticed.

“We need to be seen and be different
from everyone else. No one has dreams
of working a desk job.”

He challenged the idea that a formal
education is the only way to success, say-
ing that life experience pays dividends.

— that was social education. There’s no

With his video titled “Avatar-U-Kid-
ding-Me,” Schulman moved on to the
world of social_networking, where he said
“even small white lies can get you into
trouble.” Schulman raised the important
question to the audience of how much '
time people should be spending online
versus going out, meeting new people and .
putting themselves in other social circles.

“Don’t spend so much time identify-
ing yourself by your online profile,” he
said. “Is the point of social networking

“I watch his TV show and loved his

didn’t know what to expect, but I thought

Schulman left the crowd with a quote
from Indian civil rights leader Mohandas
Ghandi.

“‘Be truthful, gentle and fearless,’” he
said, encouraging students to be ambi-
tious and active.

“Just go for it. If you want something,

Massacre inr1968, in which U.S. soldiers,
under the command of Lt. William Calley,
killed numerous Vietnamese civilians,
forced members of the ROTC to defend
the Vietnam War. _

“And my sense was that we cadets, on
top of justifying the accreditation and
even the very presence of ROTC on the
campus, felt we also had to defend the
military’s excesses and prosecution of
the war,” LaPietra said. “I regret not'be-
ing able to make, or even perceive, that

‘ delineation.”

‘ LaPietra,_who is now a pastor at the
New Life in Christ Church in Denver, said
the main similarity he sees between the

9 social movements of today is the “vilify—
ing of opposition” by members. He said
the lone exception to this was the Civil
Rights Movement under King. ’

‘ Nearly a year’ after the end of Occupy
Pittsburgh’s physical occupation Down-
town, remnants of the movement are
largely absent from the national con-
versation. But former Occupiers still look
back on the experience fondly.

Acknowledging that her decreased
involvement in Occupy Pitt is largely in
part because of the national movement’s
disappearance from mainstream media,
McNair.said she continues to channel
her energy into “more productive ways
to create change, rather than tryingto
keep something alive that has moved on.”

. Though she is taking more time to focus
on her degree, McNair volunteered for
the Obama campaign alongside her recent
efforts in the realm of political activism.

“I volunteer for projects thathave
some of the same goals as the Occupy
Movement,” she said. “I justbelieve that
there areqmore productive and practical
ways to engage today.” .

And while he’s no longer a member
of Occupy Pitt, Branagan said the group
definitely left a lasting impression on
its members. ! A

POINT OF CLAIRE-ITY

The idea of New York might be

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

Every journey to New York City re-
minds us that Pittsburgh isn’t really
a city. Or that if Pittsburgh is a city,
New York is in a completely differ-
ent category. _

Just compare hotel rates, or cul-
tural attractions or car ownership.
Living in the city is ajcompletely
different experience than living in
Pittsburgh.

To which I can’t help but re-
spond with a shrug.

Don’t get me wrong: I wouldn’t
take the time out of my life to travel
to the city if it weren’t worth it to
me. I’m only saying that New York
City just isn’t. my favorite.-

It seems as though most people
come home from a trip to New York
talking about the same things. A
trip to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, a show in Times Square, a
quick jaunt through Central Park
and some excessive shopping com-
pose the typical agenda.

But when you move out of those
few blocks of Midtown, you’re in
for a rude awakening. just north
you’ll ﬁnd places such as the Upper
East Side, where opulent wealth is
palpable and the sharp economic
contrasts of today’s America are

apealing, bt reality is clicate

most clearly evident. ‘
The boundary of the Upper
East Side, after all, lies at East

.96th Street, which is the south-

most boundary of East Harlem,
home of Manhattan’s highest vio-
lent crime rate. The median an-
nual income in East Harlem hovers
around $27,000, while, on average,
its richer southern neighbors are
making more than four times that
amount.

It’s a city of extremes. From an‘
international tourist hub, to the
home of so many important and
powerful companies, to a popula-
tion living paycheck-to-paycheck,
falling comfortably in between
is hard. Without leaving Times
Square, it’s easy to forget what it
must be like to live in New York
City.

The sensory overload is oppres-
sive. As if it weren’t enough that
there’s always someone breathing
down your neck, you also have
to stomach the lights, the noise
and the smells of a ﬁve—borough
population of more than 8 million
people.

‘ The sidewalks are wide enough
for pedestrians to walk, but it gets
diﬂicult sometimes. You have half
of the walkers carrying cameras,
posing in front of buildings and
under street signs. Then there’s

New York: a city of ‘excitement and glamour, but also of stark divides. MCT Campus

the other half, carrying briefcas-
es, portfolios and coffee, darting
around the slow-moving tourists
to get where they need to be.

If you enjoy the bit of fresh air
the city can give you — rotten food
smells aside — walking is the best
and cheapest way to get where you
need to be, assuming, of course,
that wherever you’re going isn’t
too far. But this could be painful if
you’re planning a trip to the gro-
cery store and have to carry bags
of food numerous blocks back to
your apartment. Cabs can become
expensive very quickly, and accord-
ing to data from the U.S. Census,
more than half of New York City’s
households do not have a car for
private use.

Therefore, like in any major city,
the residents depend heavily upon
public transportation, particularly
those who commute from outside
New York each day for work. This
means you’re shoved underground
with tons of other people trying to
get somewhere at a pace none of
you can control. Just like the walk-
ing alternative, there are the New
Yorkers headed to work, following
the same path they have for years.
Right behind them is a screaming
group of high school kids on their

band trip, carrying backpacks and pausing
to Instagram pictures of themselves all the
while.

The trains are packed throughout the
day, especially at larger stopssuch as Grand
Central Station. It’s a hectic environment.
The alternative is being stuck in cripplingly
slow above—ground traffic. Sounds like a coin
toss at this point. A

Even at the end of the day, when you ﬁ— A

nally make your way back to the comfort
of your own home, you’re confronted with
the reality that is the astronomical price
tag associated with rent in the city. Recent

THE PITT NEWS  

rental market reports show that, as of De-
cember 2912, the average rental price of an
apartment in Manhattan clocks in ata scary
$3,973 a month. ,

Let’s put that into perspective. On Pitt’s
Off—Campus Living webpage, the ﬁgures
given show a single—bedroom apartment at
around $700 per month or a shared two-
bedroom apartment at $1,100 per month.
The average monthly price between these
two places for rent alone is $625 per person.
If you’re paying $625 each month in an apart-
ment at Manhattan’s averageprice, prepare
to have at least ﬁve roommates.

A But outside the commercialized and ide-
alistic wonder we associate with thosefew
blocks in Midtown, there are some wonderful
things about New York that can’t be ignored.

. ._._. .
......,-,..-.._.,...- --..a..~.,4“.,,.,.......»¢..,..,....,..,,..-=,~.-......r~..._..-._~,.....,......,.._,__...,,,,,,,1 .‘ _. ,-.

The cultural scene in New York, whether
we’re discussing art, fashion, theater, televi-
sion or music, is vast. Of course, big names
in the arts are all located here. But there
are smaller—scale hidden gems among the
recognized names. The national tour of Book
of "Mormon might come to Pittsburgh, but
a small theater’s brand new production full
of equally talented actors might never leave
NYC. The designer-brand clothes can be pur-
chased online or’ at any mall here, but the
Variety of small boutiques throughout New
York is unmatched. ' 

. Pittsburgh has its deﬁned history of steel
mills andimmigrants, but New York’s rich
immigrant history is far more impressive.
And even today, vibrant communities re-

. main, creating a home for every nationality.

 

And, come on, hearing a quality musical
performance on your way to work through
the “Music Under New York” program can’t
be bad. Each year, musicians compete for
prime performance locations in subway sta-
tions. You never know whatyou’ll be hearing.
Traditional African instruments or good-old
American j azz could go nicely with your cof-
fee as you push angrily through the crowds.

‘ In the end, it’s a big trade—off. Sure, you
might want to live in New York to gain easy
access to shows on Broadway or indulge in
some high—society—level shopping whenever
your bank account allows for it. But with
shocking wealth disparities and inconvenient
everything, don’t mistake the Big Apple for
paradise. I ‘

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrziter

The Pitt men’s basketball team fell
for a second time this season Sat-
urday against the Marquette Uni-
versity Golden Eagles, suffering its
worst loss of the year in the team’s
worst defensive performance.

Like in Marquette’s overtime
victory against Pitt at the Petersen
Events Center in January, Vander
Blue again led the Golden Eagles to
a win over the Panthers, starting
off red hot from the ﬁeld and scor-
ing 15 of his game-high 19 points
in the ﬁrst half of Marquette’s
79-69 triumph at the BMO Harris
Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wis.

In terms of how Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon usually evaluates his
team’s. performance — based on
holding opponents below 4o—per—
cent ﬁeld-goal shooting and out-
rebounding the opposition —— Pitt
failed miserably.

“There were three things we
wanted to do,” Dixon said. “Hold
them under 40-percent [shoot-
ing] defensively,— We didn’t come
close to that. We wanted to keep
them off the free-throw line —- we
certainly didn’t come close to that.
Then obviously the rebounding,
we got out—rebounded, so simply
put, the 10-point loss is really
pretty easy to see.”

The stage was set for Brianna Kie-

Coming home to play in front

of more than 300 supporters from ,

her nearby hometown of Utica,
N.Y., the Pitt women’s basketball
team sophomore guard wanted to
deliver a performance her family
and friends would be proud of.
But Kiesel and the rest of the
Panthers were unable to get the
job done Saturday afternoon at the

11th-straight Big East game this
season, falling to No. 21 Syracuse,
30'39- '

Kiesel’s play didn’t match her
usually high standards of 14.2
points per game: She only man-
aged to convert one of her nine
ﬁeld-goal attempts and ﬁnished
the game with just six points.

“It was a tough afternoon for
Bri [Kiesel],”'Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato said. “[Her family] really
came out to support her. It really
was a tough afternoon, and I know
it was one that really hurt her.” '

With freshman point guard

Brittany Gordon now out for the.
season after undergoing surgery to

repair her injured shoulder, Kiesel

has even more pressure to score.
But Kiesel was not the only

Panther who failed to ﬁnd offen-

sive success Saturday afternoon. g

The Panthers (9-15, 0-11 Big East)
shot 26.2 percent as a team, with
junior point guard Marquel Davis
being tlie only Pitt player in double

Syracuse (21—3, 9-2 Big_East)
stormedfout to a 7-0 lead in the ﬁrst
three minutes of play and didn’t

look back from there as four play- .

the Orange.

“They had a great night tonight.
They came out and were on top of
their game,” Berenato said of Syra-

cuse. “We missed shots early on,_

and we did not rebound. We were
getting on the boards, but we were

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

Robbie Rogers is gay.
The 25-year-old American
professional soccer player came

out Friday in a post_on his blog, I
but major American male profes— "-“

sional sports haven’t had more
than a few active, openly gay ath-
letes within their ranks. Rogers
also announced in the post that
he’s taking a hiatus from soccer,
but it’s unclear whether this is
related to his announcement or
to team issues. Rogers, a former
Major League Soccer star with the
Columbus Crew who also played
for the U.S. national team several
times, had been playing with third-

tier Stevenage in England on loan“

from second-tier Leeds but was
recently released from the latter
and is now without a club.
Seemingly planning to return
home and play in the MLS, Rogers

 had voiced some displeasure with

the lottery system that the league

, uses. In that system, a former MLS

or national‘ team player’s rights are
given exclusively to one club, in
this case the Chicago Fire."

What’s interesting about Rog— 
ers’ announcement is the response. ‘

Twitter was abuzz with former
teammates and opponents sending
their encouragement and congrat-

' ulations. For the most part, these

actions ring hollow.
How diﬁicult is it to send av‘:
tweet? Is it any different from

‘ or easier than commenting on a

Facebook post? The scope of the
overwhelmingly positive response
is reassuring to see, sure, but until
more than the occasional athlete ,_ __
in a major professional sport does ‘
come out and continue to play, our
society really can’t champion this
occurrence as a major step for-

ward.

male sports have come out and"‘~

now resides 1 1/2 games back from a leading
group of Big East teams in the conference
standings, which now includes No. 18 Mar-
quette (18—6, 9-3 Big East), No. 15 George-
town and No. 6 Syracuse. A win Saturday
might have thrown Pitt’s name into heavier
contention for a Big East regular-season
championship, but two losses to Marquette

alone will prove difﬁcult to surmount as the I

Panthers play their ﬁnal ﬁve games.

Pitt held strong with Marquette in the
early going, but eventually the Golden Ea-
gles’ incredible shooting percentage and
advantage on the glass allowed them to pull
away from Pitt and own a double-digit lead
at the half. The lead came after a 9-2 run

by Marquette to close the ﬁrsthalf, giving

Coach Buzz Williams’ side a 42-29 lead.

In the second half, Marquette led Pitt
by as many 17 points and fought off each
attempt the Panthers made to claw back
into the game.‘When Pitt chipped its deﬁcit

back down to 13 -or 14 points, Marquette

In contrast to the play of Pitt’s Steven
Adams, Dante Taylor and Talib Zanna, Mar-
quette’s forwards held a heavy hand in the
31-23 rebounding advantage Marquette
owned. Another area in which Pitt usually
excels, the bench play, was also countered
by Marquette, with Williams’ reserves scor-
ing 39 points to the 26 points Pitt’s second
unit recorded.

After only its second defeat in nine
games, Pitt ﬁnds itself playing a key game
against a team in the exact same spot as the
Panthers in the Big East standings: No. 21

~ Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish will enter

the Petersen Events Center Monday night
at 7 p.m. with a vendetta of their own after
the Providence College Friars blew them out
at the Dunkin Donuts Center on Saturday.

Notre Dame owns identical overall and
conference records to Pitt, and the Panthers
will ‘ﬁnd themselves playing yet another
game with heavy implications in how the Big
East tournament bracket shapes up when
it starts in less than a month.

Notre Dame plays very similarly to Pitt
in that coach Mike Brey’s squad shares the

 

Lamar Patterson (Pitt): 19 points, five rebounds

seemed to have an answer each time to push
the lead back up to 15 points and keep the
Panthers from ever threatening to complete
a comeback.

As a result, Marquette’s lead never saw
itself fallinto single digits in the second
half, and Pitt’s 10-point deﬁcit on the ﬁ-
nal box score was the closest the Panthers
came to matching Marquette in the entire
second half.

A bright spot for Pitt was redshirt junior
small forward Lamar Patterson, who had a
hot start from the ﬁeld. Patterson ﬁnished
with 19 points, shooting 7-for-12 from the
ﬁeld. Senior point guard Tray Woodall hit
his average in the game, scoring 10 points
while dishing out a game-high eight assists.

But while Pitt received superb play from
its perimeter players, the area in which
Pitt found little-to-no success was close
to the basket, where the Panthers usually
have an advantage. Marquette forwards
Jamil Wilson, Davante Gardner and Chris
Otule dominated the Panthers’ big men for
nearly every one of the 40 minutes played
Saturday.

ball on offense and shoots a high percent-
age from the ﬁeld. The Fighting Irish’s 17.9
assists per game ranks second in the nation,
and their 48-percent shooting clip ranks
No. 16 among all teams. ' 9 ‘

Junior guard Eric Atkins leads the Fight-
ing Irish’s balanced attack and will be just
another one of a long line of outstanding
backcourt players Pitt has faced this season.
Atkins averages 11.7 points per game and a
team-high 5.9 assists.

Right behind him is another stellar
guard, juniorjerian Grant, who puts up 13
points and 5.8 assists per game. Anchoring
the Irish is senior centerjack Cooley, who
averages a double-double with 14.6 points

_ and a _conference—leading 11.2 rebounds

per game.

" The one area Pitt should be able to ex-
ploit -—— the area in which Notre Dame is
most different from the Panthers —- is the
Fighting Irish’s defense. While Pitt owns
the nation’s No. -8-ranked scoring defense,
Notre Dame_sits below more than 100 teams

United States soccer piayer Robbie Rogers recently announced that he is gay-. MCT Campus

Megan Rapinoe and Abby Wambach and
basketball players Sheryl Swoopes and
Seimone Augustus, among others, which

I is cool and probably indicative of the envi-

ronments they are a part of. Liz Carmouche
not only competed in the Ultimate Fighting
Championship’s ﬁrst-ever female ﬁght, but
she also became the ﬁrst openly gay ﬁghter
to the join the organization. How long is it
going to take for that attitude to crossover
to men’s sports? M

Men’s sports on the whole don’t appear to
be ready to accept gay athletes. It has been
said since Rogers came out that his sexuality
was an “open secret” in Columbus. If this
were the case, why didn’t anything come
of it? There have been other examples of a
player’s sexuality being known internally
— including former major league baseball

player Glenn Burke and college basketball .

player Will Sheridan — where this knowl-
edge was too taboo to bring to the fore-
front. Silent acceptance isn’t negative, but
it doesn’t advance the conversation that

‘should be taking place about why profes-
sional sports are one of the last groups to
accept gay people. Additionally, Chris Kluwe
, Kenneth Faried and Brendon Ayanbadejo
are athletes playing in major professional
sports in the U.S. who have spoken on behalf
of gay rights in one way or another.

V Although politicians are coming out as
openly gay, and gay rights are advancing,
there are no active players in the NFL, NBA,
major leagues or NHL who have come out;

There have been recent examples of play-
ers coming out in college sports, and the
American soccer community is generally
pretty inclusive of people of all races and
backgrounds, unlike, for the most part,
the NFL and NBA (see Chris Culliver), and
that’s what the responses exempliﬁed on

social media.

There’s no rush for Rogers to return to
soccer. «. ~

He has plenty of playing years ahead of
him, but with a player of his caliber — he
has appeared 18 times for his country —
there lies an opportunity to break through
the rhetoric, which again is touching and
representative hopefully of the environment
that Rogers will be a part of if and when he
decides to return to professional soccer.

Journalist Cyd Zeigler, co—founder of

V the gay sports website 0utsports.com, was

quoted in a Los Angeles Times story about
this situation.

“I’d love to see him try again. It might
be a mistake for him to stop now,” Zeigler
said. “There’s a great chance that he will 
have a clear head and be able to focus on
the sport in a way he hasn’t been able to in
his adult life.’’

I can’t speak for Rogers, who has ex-
pressed his gratitude for all of the support
via Twitter, but I agree with Zeigler. The MLS
season begins at the beginning of March,
and the majority of the positive response
he’s received has come from the league’s
players. ' I

What better way to see if there are equal
actions to go along with all the kind words?

“Brave men like you will make it so that
one day the-re’s’ no need for an" announce-
ment. That day can’t arrive soon enough,”
tweeted Eddie Pope, a'U.S.’veteran of three
World Cups and now an administrator with
the MLS players’ union.

A collective effort is necessary for sys-
tematic change to occur. A

If now is not the time for gay athletes to
live their lives without having to announce
their sexuality, then when? g
