French, Greek Coma-tittees Push

Plans For Completion 0] Rooms

Travlos, Athenian Architect,
Sends Designs Started

- Five Years Ago

By Muriel White

With the arrival of the architec‘t’s
sketches, the Greek Room in the
Cathedral is becoming areality. Last
week, Mrs. Ruth Mitchell, adviser to
the Nationality Rooms, received de-
signs for the room from John
Travlos, a young Athenian classicist
who _began work on the sketches in
October, 1932. ,

The sketches show that the room
will be rectangular in form and will
be of the Ionic style. This style is
most appropriate for interiors because
of its delicacy of structure and its
opportunities for decorative detail.

A coifered ceiling, richly decorated
with soft shades of Pompeian red,
pastel-blue and green, and gold will
dominate the room. Below the ceil-
ing, there will be a frieze that sug-
gests the Porch of Maidens of the

Marble Floors Planned

Floors of the main room will be
covered with rectangular white mar-
ble slabs and will be outlined by a

. margin of light bluish gray marble.

.Iowever, the ﬂoor of the alcove will
be wholly of this bluish-gray Kokin-
ara marble. The dado, or wainscote.
will be madevof slabs of Eleusinian
marble, and will terminate in a bor-
der decorated with a pa.inted spiral
meander of the same color scheme

A as the ceiling. Above the dado, the

plaster walls will be of a soft rose
shade, thus throwing into relief the
beauty of the Ionic columns of white
Pentelic marble.
Stinchcomb Comments

Dr. James Stinchcomb, acting head
of the departmen't of classics at the
University, after viewing the sketches
of Travlos, commented that he-ex-
pected people to ﬁnd the room gaudy,
because gold and color are used to

‘a degree that people do not ordin-
_arily associate with Greek art.

“The public,” , Dr. Stinchcomb
stated, “is accustomed to seeing Gre-
cian replicas. in white; time has
washed off the paint. Today, one can-

government.

not ﬁnd a square yard of painted
surface left on the anc".~.nt originals.”

“Mr. Travlos received his informa-
tion about the colors and the amount
of coloring that should be used from
Greek literature. The Pompeian red,
the pastel shades of blue and green,
and the gold are all colors known
from the ﬂowers mentioned in Greek
writings,” he said.

Another personage who vouched
for the authenticity of the ske'tches
for the room was Dr. Jotham John-
son, an Athenian archeologist, who
examined them last Thursday when
he visited the Cathedral.

The Greek Committee in charge
of the room hope that when it is
completed Greek civilization will be-
come an understandable reality to
the students who use it for seminars.

is the ideal form of organization for
steel workers.

In a book which has just come off

in the labor situation. He is also the
author of several chapters on labor
in “Economic Principles and Prob-
lems,” an economics textbook used

dollars worth of stage money at a
Monte Carlo party sponsored by the
Newman Club, to be held tomorrow

tual broadcasting network. Station
WCAE is the local outlet for the

feature on the broadcast are “Hail
to Pitt” and “The Panther Song.”

In addition to the evening broad-
cast, Glen Gray will be interviewed
by Darrell Martin, radio editor of
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, over
station WWSW at 6:30 o’clock to-
night.

l-F Ball goers will find special ex-
press elevators running to the 17th
floor of the William Penn Hotel, with
checking facilities near the entrance
to the grand ballroom. And accord-
ing to the committee, no charge is
to be made for the use of the check-

V I'OOl1l.

While the William Penn ballroom
was acclaimed by the I-F Ball com-
mittee as an excellent setting for the
affair, the Greeks have decided to
splurge by going in for decorations
in a big way. According to chairman
Baskin, the I-F Ball is to have the
best decorations in University dance
history, with a replica of the Far-
thenon at the entrance to the ball-
room. '

In their first appearance at a Uni-
versity dance, Glen Gray and his Casa
Loma Orchestra mark the second time
that a really “big name” orchestra
acts as a drawing cardfor local stu-
dents. After tonight, the University
‘of Pittsburgh will be added to the
list of 70 colleges at which Glen Gray
has played.

Behind the ticket sellout for the
I-F Ball lies the record of an unusual
sales campaign. Because the 550 res-
ervations were to be allotted among
the 13 men's_ fraternity houses for
a wcek’s closed sale, many students
predicted that the “strictly limited"
policy would fail because it had be-
come an old story. -

But at the close of the day Un-
sale was opened to all students, therr
remained only 30 tickets that had
not been taken by fratemit_v men
The 15 additional tickets which chair
man Baskin released for sale last
Monday were taken innncdiatcly, with
the result that the I-F Ball is today

a complete sellout.

Wedne-.=(la_v evening the University
Syinpliony Orchestra gave their an-
nu:-al home concert of the year in the
Fricl-: Training School auditorium.

.l"erfo3'n1ing for a rather small but
enthusiastic audience, the orchestra
pl::_vod in true philharmonic style,
b‘cetl1ov9n'.s beautiful “Symphony No.

.1. -5.21 C Major.” .Scl1ubert’s charming

overt‘-.21'e to “Ros.a.n1unde,” and the
ilowiiig "Oedipus in Colonus” over-
lure by Succliiiii-l“1'a11ko. ,

Under the (lirection of Lee M.
Lockhart. director of music, the or-
cla-.,-.su'a also played several lighter
_v,i-ieces, including the “Morris Dance”
from “l‘a::,eant Music” by Tertus
Noble, and “Serenade Espagnole” by
Bizet.

The treat of the evening came,
however, from the soloists. Mildred
Gwrdiicr, C40, concertniaster of the
rm=l1est.ra, played two violin solos,
"Etude de Concert." by Ovid lliazin,
a diﬂicult and highly technical num-
her that was the highlight of the eve-
ning, and “Sarabande” by Carl Bohm.
A quartr_et from the University Men's
Glee Club sang several delightful
numbers and entertained the audi-
ence with a bit of musical comedy. A
piano trio composed of Harry Golby,
C39, pianoforte; Robert Rudolph,
C39, violin; and Robert Brown, C39-,
’cello, played two numbers, “Prayer”
by Schubert and “Bolero” by Mos-
cowski, both well received by the au-
dience.

The concert climaxed a year of
preparation by the o1.*~':l'iest1°a, being
the biggest event of the year on the
orchestra calendar.

Dean Addresses Group

Elmer A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
was the guest speaker at the mechan-
ical engineering seminar, held yester-
day in Room 342, Cathedral.

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who
said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated
they personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss, Jepson veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
"It's Toasted”; Luckies are gentle on the throat.

A Step Forward

WHEN SFA’s executive committee granted a
charter ‘to the Pitt Cooperative Club late
T uesday evening the undergraduate governing
group did a great deal of good both for itself and
the students concerned. It extended to that club
the right to assemble as an undergraduate group
Within the University and to initiate measures
which may lead to important improvements in the
life of the students at this University.

But this is not so important. It is important,
however, thatrecognition was given to a group
of students who had ideas and were endeavoring
to present those ideas to the University for judge-
mentas to their merit or demerit. Perhaps the
student cooperative may not prove to be effec-
tive at the University due to local business con-
ditions or the varying interests of the student
body. Perhaps, on the other hand, there may prove
to be a deﬁnite need and desirability for such
an organization. If that proves to be the case, then
the move of recognition may prove even more
important.

This recent policy of giving recognition to a
group of students who wish to assemble for the
purpose of airing and discussing does no one
harm. The students after blowing off a certain
amount of steam will find that their ideas and
motives are either worthwhile, lasting, and pos-
sibly popular with even a larger group than their
own. or else their whole purpose will prove to be
nothing at all, and will therefore stiﬁe itself to
extinction. I

It took some heroic time and effort to establish
Inquiry Forum. First, its advocates attempted
to form a club. Unsuccessful in this attempt they
then interested the Young Men’s and Young
Women’s Christian Association in the idea with
the result that today there is a regular forum that
offers students the opportunity to hear outstand-
ing speakers from all sections of the country and
from many foreign countries.

We are attempting to draw no parallel when
we mention the student cooperative and other or-
ganizations of its kind at this time. We only main-
tain that students should be extended the right
to assemble, under University supervision, rather
than being forced to go outside of the University
for a place of meeting and rather than allowing
the way to be opened for the injection of outside
influence and coercion by forces interested in
destruction rather than construction. Let the stu-
dents air their opinions within the University
rather than force them to work from the out-
side with the ideas they are attempting to ex-
press. Under the proper system the bulk of the
students, and this includes virtually everyone who
is attempting to do something, will be motivated
toward constructive ends.

Take the case of the Pitt Student Union, a local
unrecognized group which has been petitioning
for a charter for some time now. If that group
is permitted to assemble, under faculty supervision
much like any other student group or activity, then
it would soon prove its worth, or else it would
choke itself to death. Many unfortunate things
have taken place in connection with this group.
If, however, it was properly organized and per-
mitted to state through the medium of the student
newspaper just what it stands for and is attempt-
ing to do, the students and faculty would soon
enough see if it has any legs on which to stand,
and, if the necessary requirements were lacking,
then we could forget all about the whole thing.
The Pitt News does not support, neither does it

attempt to justify the existence or continuance of _

the Coop or the Pitt Student Union. We say let
the organization prove itself, but FIRST give it
the opportunity to present its case.

INCE LAST FALL the rising business in-

dex has been jolted by a series of strikes. most
of which have taken the novel form of the sit-
down. As usual the issue has been bccloudod by
‘a lot of intemperate statements from both sides;
conservatives are prone to see in the sit-down
some vague species of foreign importation. tinged
with some unspeciﬁed degree of pinkness. And
on the other hand, labor men have either been
suspicious or wildly enthusiastic about its possi-
bilities. Of all major public ﬁgures, possibly only
the CIO. and John Lewis have seen its full sig-
niﬁcance. ,

Like the discussion of the Court proposal the de-
bate has been notable in quantity if not iii-.qual-
ity. Some of the traditionally. conservative labor

men, admitting the temporary'eH"icacy of the sit-_'

down, have optimistically asserted that the old
tried and true method of striking will in time re-
assert its superiority as a labor weapon.
Conservatives, even if by sheergluck, havebeen
the ones who have struck the nail on the head as
far as the sit-down is concerned. Disassociating
the moral aspects of the case from therealistic.
it is supremely evident that the sit-down lays
new emphasis on the prevailing attitude toward
private property; and in this sense it is a revo-
lutionary device, which if carried to its ulti-
matc conclusion can only mean just that. The
conservative argument, as evidenced by the Son-
ate debate the other day, has been more attended
by emotion than by reason. There has been no at-
tempt by them to explore the implications of the
problem in a statesman-like manner and to attempt
to achieve a statesman-like solution Industry,
with a good deal more sense has accepted some of
the implications in the situation and has attempted
to reach a working agreemeiit with the sit—down—
ers. ' ~ ‘ '
Resolutions such as that offered the other day
by Senator Byrnes are dangerous in that they are
so blind. They try to solve a new problem by
suppressing it, by appealing to prejudices instead
of reason.
up enough votes for such a resolution, it would-
be unwise to push it thru. The only solution" of.
the sit-down strike is to recognize what it is and.
to make new adjustments in the -‘light of the
changing conditions.

In the news office of the Rice Institute Thresher,
they have a foundling goldﬁsh named Othello. He was

paper left under the bowl explained tearfully that a
“poor woman” could not afford to support little yel-
low Othello any longer and would the editor, "a kind
man,” take care of the poor Fish? The note was signed,
“Broken-Hearted." "Broken-Hearted" may now rest in
peace because the "kind man" is sponsoring a fish
story contest which will decide the fate of the gold-
ﬁsh. A writer of the most lie—packcd story “no longer

A Lockout Bettei"n A Sit-Down

There is, at the University of Texas, a ccrtaiii pro-
fessor who, after the late hell rang, would not let any
tardy students enter the classroom. He refused to open
the door.

Annoyed at this unseemly procedure, the members of
his class burned inwardly and waited for revenge, sweet
revenge, or something.

“We'll have an exam during our next lccturc meet-
ing,” announced the professor not long ago.

On the day of the exam, all the students were in their
seats long before the late bell rang. But no professor.
Two minutes passed. Hurried footsteps sounded in the
corridor, but before they stopped at the door, one of
the revenge-seekers had turned the lock.

Ignoring the pounding, students stayed in their seats.
After a little while the professor left. And then the stu-
dents all snuk out of the classroom.

The Good Earth

Grasping the baton from our good
friends STOP and GO, we go on with
;i consideratioii of this week’s super-
lative Nixon attraction, “The Good
Earth.” Yes, the word is superlative.
It is seldom that your reviewer was
as thorouglil_v purged of everyday
iiiaterialism as he was after viewing
the cinema dramatization of Pearl
Buck’s saga of the soil.

There have been only occasional
treats like it-—“the Hunchback of
Notre Dame,” "Smilin Thru," “Im-
itation of Life,” and more recently
"Romeo and Juliet;" these are still ‘3
vivid remembrances. “The Good;
Earth" is an uvnescapable addition.
to this list.

Perhaps the foremost criterion for
judging any dramatic presentation is
its “escape” value. We ﬁnd the great-
est escape in the preseiitation of uni-
versal philosophies and cross-sections
of the universal soul. There is no sin-
gle theme in the story or movie, but a
group of themes welded into :1 coni-
posi'te philosophy. In the life of the
Chinese peasants in the production,
human emotion, stripped of the ve-
neer of our advanced occidental so-
ciety is laid bare in its simplest and
most crying‘ form.

... :;: . :?:

Wang Lung and his stoical, al-
most clod-like wife O-lanform the
nucleus of this intensely human
story; from their lives can be
drawn many poignant examples of
human emotion presented raw.
There were two of these examples

‘that struck real fire. One deals
with O-La.n’s naive attachment to a 5
pair of pearls given her by her
husband. When he asks her why
she does not wear them she says, A
“But I take them out and look at
them sometime.” Her ‘joy in these V
baubles is akin to the world-widei

feminine love of them; but O-‘Ian's V.

feeling is the essence of ‘simple
emotion. '

Wang Lung furnishes another iii-

‘ stance. .On his wedding day he breaks

into liilari_ous laughter at the thought
that he is about to be given a bride.
He has never seen lier—but that mat-
ters little. The idea of a near mar-
riage is a. good one, hethinks. Like

O-lan’s attachment to her ‘trinkets,’
- his glee is almost childish; yet it, too;

may be described as the essence of

simple emotion.
=l= * #1

Can the reader imagine a young .
American bridegroom laughing in ,

uproarious pleasantness. because he
was going to get married and be-
cause he was going to “take a bath
all over his body?” Maybe not——
but the same feeling of satisfaction

with everything exists down under- '

neath. In Wang Lung we see it on
the surface. So we see a whole
cross section of a simple manner of
existence; we cease to identify
things about us and get lost in the
picture—-so we “escape."

The actors’ perforniances? For the
purposes of this column it is enough
to discuss Paul Muiii as Wang Lung
and Luise Rainer as O-laii. Although

Muni weaves his Wang Lung from his.

own set acting pattern, this charac-
ter is uncommonly well done. It is a
difficult character for any occidental
to fathom; give Muni credit for get-
ting a good deal of that universal
emotion already discussed, into his
interpretation. «

Luise Rainer? We expected as
much after "The Great Ziegfeld."
With about 50 lines to say, she sup-
plies the pulse-beat to the moving
story. Her pantomime has few, if
any, equals in movie history—with
her eyes and the cringing slant of
her head she conveys to us the
hints of her dormant emotion as
the stolid, mute servant of the soil,
the dutiful wife and bearer of
many children. It is a great perfor-
mance by a great actress.

As Mr. Spanos would say-—GO!

Latin Labor Problems,
Alien Assimilation

 

When in Rome, one is supposed to
do as the Romans do. But according
to Dr. John J. Geise, assistant pro-
fessor of history, the United States
is doing some Roman things fully
3000 miles and 1000 years away.

What he means is that there are
many parallels between the difficul-
ties that beset the later Roman Eni-
pire, and those that modern Amer-
ica faces.

Take, for example, the problem of
absorbing other peoples. Both the
United States and the Roman Empire
had to absorb alien cultures and tra-
ditions.

The problem of the increasing gaps
between the income groups faced
Rome as well as our country. The
rich were getting richer, and the poor
were getting poorer. Proletariat is de-_
rived from a Roman word meaning
people who have only children to give
to their country-—the poor couldn’t
pay taxes. .

Even with our machines we still
face the Roman troubles of satisfac-
torily relating labor and the produc-
tion and distribution of goods. Rome
had its “mob,” that group of people
who never worked, and to whom pol-
iticians and demagogues pandered.
Theirs was an urban pr_oletaria't.
whose troubles were caused by bad
distribution‘ of the products of the

farm and factory. We have our in-
dustrial proletariat that is misﬁt due
to the errors of our machine-made
system. -

The threat of dictatorship, against
which we are constantly being
warned, faced Rome, too, and that
Empire fell before it. .

But Dr. Geise warns that reason-
ing by analogy is adubious business
when it is done on the basis of his-
torical facts. It is impossible even to
suggest, he believes, that the things
that happened ‘to Rome will happen
to the Unitexl States. And even if it
were a good suggestion, he wouldn't.
try it.
