Soviets paired with U.S. famiies

Byjim Tezak
Asst. News Editor

Four busloads of Soviet citizens
were greeted in front of Forbes
Quadrangle Saturday by 79
American families waving tiny
U.S. and Soviet ﬂags as the North
Hills High School marching band
played the “Appalachian
Overture.”

A short ceremony was then
held to welcome the Soviets to
Pitt, who had arrived for
“Chautauqua at Pitt: The Fifth
General Chautauqua Conference
on U.S.—Soviet Relations.”

“We are especially honored and
pleased that we can have you
here for this especially important
week of conferences,” said Pitt
President Wesley Posvar.

The guests from the Soviet
Union, many of whom do not
speak English, were" then
introduced to the Americans who
will be their host families for the
next week.

Susan Morris was one person
who expected to have trouble
communicating with her guests.

Morris will be hosting two

Sets, who don’t speak English,
‘.;«r a couple of days. An interpreter

was supposed to be there to help 2

her talk to them but did not show
up. '
L When asked how she planned
to communicate with the Soviets,
Morris said, “with difficulty."

Jill Weaver, whose family will
be hosting two Soviet citizens,
said, “My husband and I both did
some travelling as children. So
far, we haven’t been able to take
our kids to Europe. This is a great
way to help our children learn
about the world.

“Also, my father was in the
U.S.S.R. in 1962; so I’ve always
had a personal interest in the
Soviet Union.”

Another woman had been
searching for her Soviet guest for
some time. When the two finally
met, they embraced warmly, and
both women began laughing.

One Soviet, Vladimir Poltavetz,
stopped to excitedly introduce
his host family to his companions.

“It’s just amazing,” Poltavetz 

said of his impression of the

United States so far. “1t’s very 
beautiful. My English is not very if

good; so I cannot express my full
feelings, but it is very good.”
An important aspect of the
Soviet delegation to Chautauqua
is that this is the first time Soviet
university students have been

allowed to participate in such an 
event. In the past, Soviet youth 

delegations consisted of people
in their late 20s or early 30s.

“I think that I had a pretty 59

correct image [of the United States]
before I got here,” said Yuriy
Stupak, a graduate student at the

Once again Pitt and Penn
State will combine their efforts
to raise blood in the annual
Pitt-Penn State Blood
Challenge.

This year, the challenge will
be taking place from Nov. 6
- gthrough Nov. 20. During this
2 time, there will be 20 blood

drive centers in various campus

sites including: Benedum Hall,
the Towers, Forbes Quad,

Langley Hall, the Kurtzrnan

room in the William Pitt Union,

and the Law Building lounge.
According to Dave Edmunds,
the field representative for the

Central Blood Bank and the

coordinator for the annual

blood challenge, “This year’s
goal is to collect 2,500 units of
blood, an increase over last
year’s 2,059 collected units.”
This year, donators will
receive a sports squeeze bottle,
along with a free cholesterol
«ltest.
* One goal of the 1989 Blood
Challenge is to receive

Pitt-Penn St. feud draws blood

increased donations from Pitt
Greeks, student organizations,
the student body, the faculty
and the administration.
Department heads for the blood
drive have been named from
faculty members in an effort to
get the university community to
work together successfully.

Mark Banchansky and Polly
Speros, Internal and External
Public Relations for Greek
Week, are hoping to increase
donations for Greek Week.

Banchansky explained, “The
blood drive for the Pitt Greeks
is Nov. 7, 8 and 9. Independent
donations will count towards
the Greek Week blood total
during this time.”

Edmunds noted, “The Greeks
really put us over the top. Last
year they raised 2,600 units of
blood for Greek Week.”

The challenge, which has
been going on since 1983, has
increased its blood donations
each year.

“T O giveanidea of the increase
over the years, in 1985, 986
signed up to donate. In 1988 we
collected 2,059 units of blood.

Pitt won the challenge in 1983
and 1988, which is outstanding
since Penn State University Park
has about 20,000 more people
to draw from, ” stated Edmunds.

The Central Blood Bank
services 32 area hospitals along
with Life Flight and Angel, two
emergency systems. Over 550
units of blood are needed each
day. The challenge, therefore,
actually services hospitals for
about 4 1/2 days.

“When you donate blood,
you automatically save three
lives and anyone who you feel
responsible for can receive
blood because you are a
donor,” said Edmunds. “You
never know when it can
happen to you.”

The winner of the challenge
will be announced at halftime
of the Pitt-Penn State game.

Banchansky said, “It’s a time
when we can cometogether as
one for a cause. Not only do
students get to know faculty,
but we all become uniﬁed.”

Edmunds noted, “Pitt
understands the need for blood
donation."

Musicmobile campaign aimed
at underage drin/eing problem

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff "Writer

It's a sign of the times. Last year
when Pontiac held its national
college “Musicmobile” campaign
to help raise awareness of youth
drinking problems, the crowd-
drawer was a contest to guess
how many cassettes could fit into
a car. This year they filled the
Pontiac Le Mans GSE with

*compact discs instead.

“The contest is a really good
deal. We gave each person two
guesses for a dollar and only
asked for donations, so there
were some guesses given for free.
Three Pitt students will deﬁnitely
be getting prizes and everyone
who participated will be up for
the national drawing for the grand
prize," said Scott Paladino, Sigma
Chi fraternity member.

The Pitt student whose guess is
closest to the actual number of
CD3 that can fit from the
dashboard to the trunk of the
Pontiac will win an Emerson CD
player and 25 CD3. Second and
third prizes are an Emerson

cassette player and 25 cassettes
and a portable Emerson cassette
player, respectively. A drawing
will be held when the national
campaign is over for a new
Pontiac GrandAm and the Pontiac
Le Mans GSE. '

“We had both cars on display
here during the three days and a
24-hour security guard to protect
them," Paladino said.

Five parking places were
blocked off for the promotion,
which was held in the front of
Hillman Library.

“We also gave away T -shirts
and key chains during the three
days that we sold guesses.
Everyone seemed very
enthusiastic about giving it a try,”
said Robert Wagner, who is also
a member of Sigma Chi.

Last year, the Musicmobile
campaign was run by Pi Lambda
Phi fraternity, but this year when
the opportunity to participate in
the campaign was brought up to
the Inter-Fraternity Council, Sigma
Chi decided to take on the
responsibility.

Chautauqua begins with pledge for communication

. ByMattMartin

Editor in Chief

The final two busloads of Soviet delegates
to the Chautauqua at Pitt Conference
unloaded at the Oakland Holiday Inn
Sunday afternoon to a warm but quick
welcome from Pitt President Wes1ey.Posvar.

“From the city of Pittsburgh and the
University of Pittsburgh, welcome to our
Soviet- friends,” Posvar said, toasting the
Soviet citizens with a glass of wine.

To the casual observer, this event may

have seemed. nothing more than a weekend
business-convention. People milled about
the Schenley Room, sipping wine and
shaking hands while lunch was being
prepared. But for the Chautauqua
Institution, the University of Pittsburgh
and the governments of the United States
and the Soviet Union, it was just the
beginning of something that is much bigger.

The Fifth General Chautauqua
Conference on U.S.-Soviet Relations
ofﬁcially began at 4 p.m. Sunday with the
opening ceremonies in the Syria Mosque
Auditorium, and the first of the scheduled
events begins today at 10 a.m. with a
plenary session on the current state of
U.S.-Soviet relations. By Friday, the over
200 Soviet delegates, numerous
distinguished American speakers and

‘ possibly thousands of U.S. citizens will

have discussed economic, cultural, social,
' political, technological and ecological
differences and similarities in the two
most powerful nations in the world.
“I think we’ll be under some space
pressure during the six days,” Valentina
T ereshkova, chairwoman of the U.S.S.R.’s

I Union of Soviet Friendship Societies and

the first woman ever in space, said through
an interpreter. “But I think these days will
enable us to understand each other better. ”

The opening ceremonies presented to a
half-capacity audience the major players
in the conference, as well as some words
from keynote speakers, including Senator
John Heinz (R—PA), Chautauqua Institution
President Daniel L. Bratton, Deputy Minister

Qof the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Vladimir Petrovsky, Director of United
States Information Agency Bruce S. Gelb,
Posvar, Tereshkova and Pittsburgh Mayor
Sophie Masloff.

“This is another historic moment in U.S.-
Soviet relations,” said Bratton. “It proclaims

where we have come in four short years,” .

he said. The first conference was held at
the Chautauqua Institution in southwestern

New York in 1985 with approximately one
dozen Soviet representatives.
Approximately 270 U.S. delegates travelled
to Jumarla, Latvia in 1986; 258. Soviets
journeyed to Chautauqua in 1987 and 297
Americans ventured to Tbilisi, Georgia in
1988.

After Posvar welcomed the entire
delegation on behalf of “all the American
people,” Gelb took the podium to read
aloud a letter from U.S. President George
Bush.

“I'm delighted to offer my warmest
greetings to the American and Soviet
participants gathered in Pittsburgh for the
Fifth Annual Chautauqua Conference on

United States—Soviet relations. A warm
welcome to our foreign guests,” Gelb read
from the letter.

“These conferences have played an
important role in building understanding
between the American and Soviet peoples.
 My greetings to the city of Pittsburgh
that has joined in a tradition of hosting
these conferences, opening its heart and
homes for the week-long American—Soviet
experience.

“The United States and the Soviet Union
have made considerable progress in
resolving differences and finding new

paths.  It is my hope that this positive .

trend, marked by the free and open

Soviet citizens face the
same task today [as
Pittsburghers faced in
past times]. We can help
each other andourselves.

exchange of ideas will continue. To the
important members of this conference;
the Chautauqua Institution,’the University
of Pittsburgh, the Soviet Friendship Society,
and to the hundreds of people in Pittsburgh
who have worked to make this program
possible, please accept my congratulations
and best wishes for a successful conference.
God bless you, George Bush,” Gelb read.
Following Gelb, T ereshkova said that
she was impressed with the way the
university handled the conference while
the English-speaking audience listened
through headphones to an interpreter. '
“I think I can say that the university is a

‘ university of friendship,” she said. “This

could be a good example for other
countries to follow. a

“Let me thank you for the cordiality we
have felt from our first steps here in
Pittsburgh,” she said. I S

T ereshkova said that she had high hopes
this conference would be more than a
vacation for the Soviet delegation, however.

“We share universal human values,” she
said. “The Soviet Union and the United
States are the major realities of the modern-
day world. We have one common interest,
and that is to save humanity from nuclear
conquest. The common denominator
should be the questions of trust building.”

Masloff was introduced at the podiu'm
after Tereshkova and Petrovsky, who spoke
to the audience in a heavily—drawled
English that sent the Soviets scrambling
for their earphones and a Soviet interpreter.
Masloff broke the serious tone that the two
Russian diplomats had set only a few
moments before. .

“My first move," Masloff said, “was to

issue a proclamation for perfect weather.” *
The audience broke out in laughter. but

Masloff assumed the serious role that the
conference deals with.

“Surely the future of the planet is in the
hands of our two countries,” she said.

Heinz assumed the role of keynote
speaker, ﬁlling out the remainder of the
ceremonies. He openly compared
Pittsbufgh’s rebuilding under the

Renaissance and Renaissance 11 programs ,

to the current state of the Soviet Union
under glasnost and perestroilea.
“Soviet citizens face the same task today,”
as Pittsburghers once faced, said Heinz.
“We can help each other and ourselves,"
Heinz said. “Welcome to Pittsburgh.”

And, as Petrovsky said, “Chautauqua at
Pitt has convened.”

Volunteers vital to successof U.S.-Soviet conference

‘By Suzanne Sabol

Staff Writer

The Chautauqua conference has begun at Pitt, and
hundreds of volunteers will be on hand this week to help

keep the sessions and workshops running
smoothly. Many others have been working
behind the scenes since April to plan and
organize the conference.

“There was so much that needed to be
done. It was overwhelming at first,” said
Ronna Lash, a Pitt sophomore who

‘*3’ volunteered “many hours” of her time in

the Chautauqua offices in the weeks
preceding the event.

Joan Fernsler, volunteer-coordinator for
Chautauqua, has worked with Lash and
others to Contact Pitt student groups in the
search for more volunteers.

Ian Samways, who is taking time off

from his Russian studies at Yale, became involved with
the Chautauqua conference because “it was a very

questions they may have" for a few weeks now.

Fernsler said she isn’t surprised at the number of
students that wanted to help during the Chautauqua

conference.

ChautauquaNotes

The opening ceremonies were followed by a Pittsburgh Performing Artists
Presentation. The festivities included performances by the Pittsburgh Dance
Alloy, Sam Hazo of the International Poetry Forum, a medley by ethni; dancers,
including Die Lustigen Isartaler, Grecian Odyssey Dancers, Irish Dance
Ensemble and Polonia Song and Dance Ensemble. Dan Karnin and Glorious
Rebirth also performed.  A citizen’s open dialogue will be held at 8 p.m.
tonight in the Syria Mosque Auditorium. Moderators will be Vladimir Posner and
Phil Donahue, television talk-show hosts in the U.S.S.R. and U.S., respectively.

 

Fernsler has found many volunteers from the university
students and faculty and also from other Pittsburgh
residents who expressed an interest in Chautauqua.

Ed Landerman, a retired engineer from‘Westinghouse’s

nuclear division, said he became involved
because he is interested in the environment,
and wanted to attend the session on
environmental issues. '

“I was so impressed with the quality of
the people involved, that I pushed myself
to volunteer,” he said. —

Another volunteer, Violet Coviello of
Cheswick, said she had an interest in U.S.-
Soviet relations and attended the New
York Chautauqua conference in 1987.

She said that volunteering has been
quite interesting and rewarding.

“I feel I’m helping the two countries
have a better relationship.”

Both Coviello and Landerman have worked for the past

ROTC offers college challenge

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

A chance to excel, achieve, be a leader and
sometimes get ragged for your mistakes. An
opportunity to go places and meet_ a wide
network of people. This is what the Reserve
Officer Training Corps is all about.

According to Captain Raymond Horoho, ROTC
“is more than paint your face and march around
the Cathedral till you drop. It’s a stable
environment.

“I think it’s the best thing in the world for a

college ‘freshman lwho] gets here, gets a
roommate, eats some of the chow and needs a
little help to get going. We’re an instant social
group.”
» Captain Horoho also likens ROTC to a new
car. “You buy the car, take it off the lot; it’s got
a lot of power, but you ‘re not quite satisﬁed with
the color. When you go to hang your sports coat,
you don’t like where the hook is. But you get out
of that car, look at it, and all in all it’s great, and
you know you’d buy it again. y

“When you can do this, it’s like weighing pros
and cons; if there are more pros than cons, keep
it.”

The Army ROTC faces the challenge of putting

I 8,-000 qualiﬁed lieutenants into active duty in the

armed forces each year. However, “IROTCI
holds to quality, not quantity. If a kid comes up
to us with a 1.7 GPA, thinking this is his last
chance, we aren't looking for that type of
person,” said Horoho.

The ROTC program is set upin stages according

I to the cadet’s year in school. “The first two years

are like an ongoing job interview,” Horoho said.
All cadets are ranked at the end of each semester.

After the first two years of basic military
training, cadets can move on to advanced training
during their junior year. At this time they are
instructed in leadership and tactical skills. Then,
during their senior year, “we put the spit and
polish on you. You get the opportunity to try out
your leadership skills. '

“When you’re out on the field for real, it’s no
time to make mistakes you could have made in
college. In college, the mistakes won’t cost lives.
We give our officers a chance to plan, then
execute,” Horoho said.

-ROTC officers are also trained in counseling
and public-speaking skills. Horoho said that
numerous employers have come to him for

potential employees because employers associate

ROTC with a level of maturity.

Many options are availableto cadets when
they graduate. They can join the Army Reserve
or go into active duty, among other things; if
‘nothing else, they will still have the experience
they have obtained during their training.

Cadets can apply for several scholarships
which pay $7,000, or 80 percent of their tuition
costs, $395 for books and supplies, $ 100 a month
for pocket money and any incurred lab fees.
These scholarships are competed for on a national
basis and are awarded to “the best of the best.”
Lastyear, nine Pitt cadets applied for a three—year
scholarship, and five of the nine won.

Captain Horoho said that scholarships help
ROTC keep up its standards. “We want to work
hard for our image. We put a lot of time into our
officers and expect a lot out of them,” he said.

Quality care. From doctors Who care. That’s What you
expect from your health plan. And at HealthAmerica, that’s exactly
What you get. L

We’ re affiliated with over 800 physicians Who’ve received
their training from some of the finest universities and most
prestigious internship and residency programs.

They’ve chosen to work with HealthAme.rica for the same
reasons so many people have chosen to join Hea1thAmerica. Because
we offer high quality health care. With no bills, no deductibles and

- no paperwork. ‘

We also cover preventive services in full. . .like mammo-
grams, periodic physicals, routine ob/gyn check—ups, pediatric
check—ups and immunizations. Not to mention stress management
programs and smoking-cessation classes. (Traditional plans don’t
cover these services, which is Why you might Want to consider a

break in tradition.) .

And while many of our 110,000 members initially chose
our plan for the savings, they’ve remained HealthAmerica members .\
because of the expert care. And because they can choose any
HealthAmerica doctor they ’d like. .

So while cost may be one reason for choosing HealthAmerica,
we have over 800 others that are even more important. I

Pittsburgh's current trial board system is not sufficient

The people of Pittsburgh are

presently being exploited by the

police department's trial-board
system.

The Fraternal Order of P0-
lice is very strong in Pittsburgh,
andthe members are very loyal
to each other. The F.O.P. is very

powerful as both a voting and
a political body. It has fought
frantically and ﬁrmly against
the proposed changes both of
Mayor Sophie Masloff and the
wvo mayors before her. By
controlling and monopolizing

or situation.

Without argument, one of the foremost concerns
of the government must be to reduce the deficit.
However, must this be accomplished only by hack-
ing away at programs that are essential to the well-

It seems that the programs at the top of the hit list
are the so-called social programs that include pro-
grams for children, the elderly and the poor. These
programs, which are backed mostly by Democrats
(ironically), have been placed on the endangered
species list by their own kind — the Democrats in

If they are successful in their endeavor, there will
be no broadening of Medicaid coverage to children
and pregnant women with incomes above what is
considered to be the poverty level, the problems
concerning the paying of doctors by Medicare will
not be resolved, child-care grants to states, tax
credits to families and a raise in the earned-income
limit for Social Security recipients between the ages
of 65 and 69 without a cut in their benefits will

never see the light of day.

Obviously, something must be cut in order to
reduce the deficit. However, making life more dif-
ficult for the elderly and the poor is not the
solution. That is not to say that all social programs
should be protected at the expense of any other
budget; however, there are definitely some areas in
which items such as defense spending could be
made more frugal. It does not have to be an either/

not answer

ion has corrupted the system and,

~ therefore, corrupted itself.

In using the word cormpt, I am
stating that the internal problems
with the trial-board system are
possibly a worse kind of corruption
than payoffs or bribes. With a sys-
tem like this one, there is a lot of
room for possibilities of other kinds
of corrupt behavior and actions. ,

_A trial-board system is employed
by the Pittsburgh police department
to judge complaints and cases against
police officers. Essentially, the trial
board is used as the ultimate and

final step in the legal process to ‘

keep the police department in check.
The trial board is a group of three
police officers who are chosen at
random to hear complaints and cases
filed against police officers for al-
leged wrongdoings. Thus, when a
citizen or anyone else files a com-
plaint or charges against an officer,
the officer must eventually go be-
fore the trial board, and after a thor-
ough investigation is made to deter-
mine whether or not he is guilty, he
is sentenced in accordance with the
ruling.

vWhile this system of the trial
board has been in use for about 15
years, and has been criticized for
much of that time, it wasn't until this
year that the trial board has come
under intense fire from the city.
Although the trial-board system has
been controversial and an impor-
tant and significant issue of city
politics over about the last 10 years,
the problems with it has reached a
peak overthe past year. This recent
criticism has been strong but cer-
tainly more could be done to react

to the outrageous injustices of
the trial board.

In an interview on Monday,
Oct. 16, 1989, a very cheerful and
friendly Masloff spoke frankly
and sternly to me about the prob-
lems with the trial-board system.
Mayor Masloff is very upset about
the trial board, and it is her
ambition to see to it that the
system is changed in the very
near future. “I am continuing the
fight against the trial board that
was begun by [former] Mayor
Pete Flaherty and continued by
[former] Mayor Richard Caliguri,"

said Masloff. The Mayor and her
administration have been par-
tially responsible for taking the
fight against the trial board far-
ther than anyone has ever done
before.

“I think the trial-board sys-
tem is a very important issue to
Pitt students,” Masloff said. In-
variably there are a lot of police
officers in Oakland, particularly
on weekends, so this issue may
have a greater impact on stu-
dents than on the average citizen
of Pittsburgh.

The system needs desper-
ately to be changed if not dis-
solved altogether. It is Masloffs
goal to bring about major changes
in the system that will be great
improvements. The major

 

changes include a three-person
trial-board committee, consisting
of a member of the police depart-
ment, a representative chosen by
Mayor Masloff herself and a third
party to be agreed upon by the
first two parties. Certainly, this
would be a drastic improvement
over a three-person committee
monopolized by three police
ofﬁcers, as it now stands. With
three members of the F.O.P. as

' the only people on the commit-

tee, there is no objectivity among
its ranks.

Masloff said‘ that the Penn-
sylvania State House of Repre-
sentatives will soon vote on the
proposed changes for the trial
board. According to the mayor,
the fight against the police union
has never progressed as far as the
state legislature. That in itself is a
tremendous victory for Masloff
and her administration. If the

proposed changes are approved,_ -

€73

rt

then the fight will be even closer '

to an important and significant
change. These changes should
be only the beginning for the trial
board. Masloff was not conﬁdent
of a sure victory in the state
legislature, but she was extremely
hopeful.

The Pittsburgh police trial-
board system is very corrupt, and
the proposed changes of Mayor
Masloff and her administration
would truly lead to major im-
provements in the system.

Halloween and politics mes/9 tocreate oz ’goulz'sb’ mixture

We owe a great deal of thanks
to the inventor of Halloween.
Without this great day, millions
of ‘small children would be with-
out a special day to collect candy,
the Great Pumpkin (whom only
Linus and I seem to believe in)
would be non—existent and cos-
tume shops could not remain
solvent.

But I am most grateful for this
holiday because it gave me a
topic to write about this week,
without which my faithful read-
ers would not see my usual
blather, but rather a “THIS SPACE
FOR RENT” sign instead — now

which would be better? Don’t

answer that.

I’ve always enjoyed Hal-
loween because it gave me a
chance to emulate my favorite
heroes in appearance as well
as mannerism. When I was in
elementary school the cos-
tumes were easy. I dressed in
the usual kiddie outﬁts: cow-
boys, pirates, H.L. Mencken,
Jimmy Hoffa—- the usual stuff.

As I grew older and went
to high school and college
Halloween parties, the cos-
tumes of my idols grew harder
and harder to come by. Two
years ago, I went to a party at
Westminster College as Wil-

 

liam F. Buckley, Jr. I bought a brown

suitthat was a size too big and acted

my usual self; I won first prize.
Probably the weirdest Hallow-

 

 

een party I’ve ever been to was at
my old college. It was thrown by the
women’s studies department. The
funny thing was, everyone came
dressed as a famous man. I tried to
explain the hypocrisy of this to the
department chairman/woman/
whatever. She looked at me, asked

there was the fear of people

if she could borrow my football
helmet and told me to help myself
to the cookies and grog.

Back when I was a kid, Hal-

_ loween and trick-or-treating were .
so uncomplicated. Back then,‘ the
I only candy we got were Clark

bars and Mallo-Cups. These days
anything from a subscription to
Psychology Today to a half pound
of chipped ham is fair game.
Back then, the ACLU did not
require that 30 percent of cos-
tumes worn must represent mi-
nority monsters.

We did have to worry about
tainted candy in my youth, but

 

putting glass or pins or whatever
into the sweets. However, my
neighborhood was so tough that
people put razors in your goody-
bag without bothering to conceal
it in the candy.

Yes, Halloween has certainly
changed. It too has evolved from
something totally apolitical into
an entity that has been swept up
by the sea of politics. Too many
people are trying to politicize a
day that should have absolutely
no connection with conservatism}-
or liberalism in any shape or
form. Incidentally, I have a party
to go to tomorrow. Does anyone
know where I can pick up an
Emmet Tyrrell mask?

Poor progress poses plenty of problems for Panthers

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Wh.:n the
Pitt./Notre Dame game started,
the Indiana sun covered most of
Notre Dame Stadium. While the
sun was still high, Pitt jumped out

to an early lead over the top-
ranked Fighting Irish, but as
shadows and darkness took over,
both the great ball of ﬁre and the
Panthers’ hopes for an upset
faded. I
Pitt scored on their opening
possession, capped off by a eight

yard scoring pass from Alex Van
Pelt to Ronald Redmon, to take a
7-0 lead, but the Irish capitalized
on many Panther mistakes and
scored the remaining points in
the 45-7 blowout.

“Notre Dame just whipped us
in every area, said Pitt head

Pitt's Alex Van Pelt (10)  Roman’ Matusz (62) look on as the top ranked Notre Dame
Fighting Irish run up a 45-7 victory over the Panthers.

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

SOUTH BEND, Ind. —— If
there were a self-destruct
button on the Panther sidelines
this weekend, it would now
be under repair for overuse.

“We made a lot of mistakes,”
is a statement that Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried says after
every football game, and the
Panthers made many of the
same mistakes that they have
been committing all season
against Notre Dame. Only this
time, they paid a hefty price
for their undisciplined
rniscues.

Four times alone in the first
half, the Panthers were guilty
of illegal procedure penalties,
two of which put them in bad
field position, eventually
nullifying already sputtering
drives. At 6:59 of the first, a
procedure call backed Pitt up
to its own 4-yard line forcing
a first and 15. On third down
of the same drive,«after Pitt
failed to gain a single yard,
Alex Van Pelt lost his footing
and fell into the end zone,

‘ giving Notre Dame a safety
and its first points of the game.

At 11:26 of the second
quarter, Pitt drew yet another

illegal-procedure, penalty, and
instead of having a third and two

from their own 25, they faced a’

third and seven from the 20. Van
Pelt threw an incompletion, and
the Panthers were forced to punt.

The Panthers have been
committing illegal-procedure
penalties against teams ranging
from the 0-8 Pacific Tigers to the
undefeated Fighting Irish. Playing
against the No. 1 team in the
nation, on their home turf on

V national television may have been

an excuse for the infractions, but
defensive tackle Marc Spindler
was quick to put that assumption
to rest.

“lThe penalties] are a result of
a lack of discipline. We've been
in big-game atmospheres before,
just like this one. There were no
jitters involved,” Spindler said.

In addition to the four
procedure-calls, Pitt did
themselves in with numerous
other penalties. Toward the end
of /tlre/first, Irish punterjim Sexton
booted a punt, which should
have had a stewardess on it,
which landed in the end zone.
Pitt returner Alonzo Hampton
called for a fair catch at his own
8—yard line but decided to throw
an illegal block to prevent the
Irish from downing the ball inside
the Panther 10. As a result, instead

A special teams] running and

of a touchback, Pitt had to
start out at their own four.

“I saw the ball go over my
head and I saw the man [Irish

my first thought was to block
him and try to keep him from
downing the ball. But
unfortunately, I had already
given a fair catch signal,”
Hampton said.

Unfortunately indeed. Pitt
was forced to punt, and on
Notre Dame’s next possession,
Irish tailback Rodney Culver
capped a seven- play drive with
a one-yard TD dash.
Quarterback Tony Rice
successfully executed a two-
point conversion, and the Irish
took a 10-7 lead.

If Hampton’s special teams
rniscue weren’t enough, the
Panthers’ decided to do
something else illegal on Jeff
Greenfield’s punt on their next
drive in the second quarter.
After Raghib Ismail called for
a fair catch, Barry Threats
decided to tackle/escort him
out of bounds resulting in a
1 5-yard personal-foul penalty.

Wyche once said, “Once that
hand goes up in the air on a
punt return, you never, ever,

coach Mike Gottfried. “We
unraveled. One of the main things
that hurt us was inconsistency.

_ We made a lot of mistakes. We

just self-destructed. They are a
powerful and impressive team. I
said a long time ago Notre Dame
and Miami are on a different
plane.”

The destruction started on Pitt’s
second possession. The Panthers
started the drive on their own 6-
yard line, and an illegal procedure
penalty on the first play put them
back to the three. On the third
play of the drive Van Pelt lost his
footing on the natural turf and
fell into the end zone for a safety,
making the score 7-2.

The Panther defense stopped
the Irish again and forced them to
punt. Pitt punt returner, Alonzo
Hampton, called for a fair catch,
but as the ball sailed into the end
zone, he blocked a Notre Dame
defender for the Panthers’ fourth
penalty in just over 10 minutes.
The penalty set Pitt up inside
their own 5-yard line for the
second straight time.

After N otre Dame’s Andre Jones

sacked Van Pelt at the Pitt 3—yard
line, the Irish’s return specialist
Raghib “Rocket” Ismail got his

Brister impressive in  

first chance to return a punt. He
fielded Brian Greenfield’s 50-yard
punt and returned it down the
sideline 17 yards.

With just 36 yards to go for a
touchdown, the Irish quickly took
over the lead. The drive ended
with Rodney Culver’s 1-yard
touchdown run.
Coach Lou Holtz opted to go for
the 2-point conversion.
quarterback Tony Rice kept the
ball on the option and made the
score 10-7.

Pitt’s field position woes
continued throughout the rest of
the first half as they started inside
their own 20-yard line three out
of four times. On the other hand,
Notre Dame started their drives
inside Panther territory all but
once.

Despite the Irish’s excellent
field position, they were unable
to move the ball on Pitt’s defense.
Pitt was aided by a missed 32-
yard field goal by Notre Dame's
Craig Hentrich. - '

The Fighting Irish expanded
their lead to 17-7 late in the
second quarter when Van Pelt
overthrew his receiver and free
safety Pat Terrell intercepted the

23-17 Steeler Victory

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer ‘

Kansas City Chiefs’ head coach Marty Schottenheimer appeared
rather calm after witnessing his team take their fifth loss of the season,
a 23-17 decision to the Pittsburgh Steelers yesterday at Three Rivers
Stadium. He stood on the postgame interview platform casually, not
like he had just watched Pittsburgh's Dwayne Woodruff knock the
tying touchdown pass away from the hands of Stephan Paige with
less than 10 seconds left in the game. On fourth down, nonetheless.

“What can I say? It was obviously frustrating," said Schottenheimer,

who suffered his first loss to the Steelers ever as a head coach. In his ‘

4 1/2 years with Cleveland, he had a perfect 6-0 slate against the Black

and Gold.

“Our football players battled, but we weren’t clean in executing
really at all. We scratched and clawed and battled all day, as did

Pittsburgh.”

The Steelers, if they were seriously planning on winning the game,
really didn’t have much of a choice.

Coming off an embarrassing 27-0 loss to Houston a week ago,
Pittsburgh had the benefit of having quarterback Bubby Brister back
under center after his three-week knee injury hiatus. But Brister,
usually a daring and dashing scrambler, still wasn’t himself. He
limped noticeably during the game, especially after a couple of
ferocious hits from Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas. His
scrambling ability was reduced to the level of, oh, say a Dan Fonts
in ski boots. On one rollout to his right, Brister actually resembled
a kid galloping along on a polo pony.

“I'd say I was at 50-percent mobility, at best,” said Brister, who
completed an impressive 17 of 27 passes for 255 yards and two
touchdowns. “In the second half, the leg was real stiff. But itfeels

pretty good now, especially since
we won.”

' So the Steelers scratched and
clawed and battled all day and
gave their leader just enough
support to even up their record at
4-4.

The first half actually appeared
as if Pittsburgh were going to
walk cleanly away with the game.
The Steelers marched 41 yards
on the game’s opening drive to
set up a 41-yard Gary Anderson
field goal. Brister then riﬂed a 16-
yard touchdown pass to tackle-
breaking wide receiver Louis
Lipps on their second possession.
With five minutes left in the first
quarter, the Steelers led 10-0.

Meanwhile, the defense kept
the K.C. offense in check.
Christian Okoye, a monstrous 6-
foot-1-inch, 260-pound fullback
and the team’s leading rusher,
came into the game averaging
101.1 yards a week. Pittsburgh
allowed him only 36 on nine
carries by halftime. “We had to
stop him,” said Steeler cornerback
Rod Woodson. “He’s a big boy,
the key to their attack.”

Okoye finished with 101 yards
on 23 carries. -

Two more Anderson field goals
put Pittsburgh ahead 16-0. Then
with 29 seconds left in the half,
the Chiefs got the ball back for

one last drive.

Eventually, they got more than
that back. «

Kansas City started out at their
own 25; so Steelers head coach
Chuck Noll ordered his team into
a prevent defense. Two quick
passes by quarterback Steve
DeBerg of 20 and 24 yards the
Chiefs were in Nick Lowery field
goal range. His 50-yard attempt
sailed straight through the
uprights as time expired.

“I'll never understand why
[Pittsburgh] is in that defense,”
growled NBC analyst Paul
McGuire at the time. “They’ve
stopped the Chiefs all day long in
their regular defense, and now
they’re playing soft, and Kansas
City is taking advantage of it.
Why?”

Now the Chiefs had something
they didn’t have at all up to that
point — momentum.

“That kick,” said
Schottenheimer, “gave us a real
lift. Up to that point, we couldn’t
do anything. We came out in the
second half with life.”

So did DeBerg. He completed
six straight passes after the
second-half kickoff, including an
8—yard shot to Pete Mandley for a
touchdown, which cut the margin
to 16-10. He finished the game
24 of 56 for 338 yards. ‘

Pittsburgh was forced to punt

on their ensuing possession, and
the Chiefs moved quickly
downfield and into a 3rd-and-7
situation at the Steelers 23; but a

in bad snap by center Mike Webster

over the head of DeBerg was

worth 26 yards of territory, and V 

Kansas City had to wait until the

Steelers got the ball back before i 

taking the lead.
A bad exchange on a reverse

between running back Merril,

Hoge (15 carries, 65 yards) and
wide receiver Dwight Stone at
the Pittsburgh 20 caused the ball
to pop loose. Bill Maas of the
Chiefs pounced on the fumble
and tumbled into the end zone
for the score. Kansas City led for
the first time, 17-16.

“It was really my fault,” said
Stone. “I tried to hurry one of
those things that you aren't
supposed to hurry.”

The Steelers needed only one_

play after the kickoff to retake the
lead.

“We had run a particular play
four times already, and I threw it
short to Warren Williams every
time for the sure yardage,” said
Brister. “[Lippsl said he had been
getting open, and [offensive
coordinator] Tom Moore said
‘Let’s skip the 10 yards and go for
it all here.’ It worked.”

Lipps got a step on cornerback
Albert Lewis down the right

sideline, andthe result was a 64-
yard touchdown play, his second
of the game and the longest pass
completion of the year for the
Steelers. .

“That’s why weghave Louie on
the team, for those kind of plays,"
quipped Brister. Lipps finished
with 7 catches for 130 yards.
