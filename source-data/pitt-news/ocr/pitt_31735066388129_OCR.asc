Study links education and j obs

By Jennifer Calabrese
‘ Staff Writer

The role of education will be
essential in preparing an
employable and productive work
force in Southwestern
Pennsylvania, according to the
recently released State of the
Region report.

“If people do not get a good

a "ducation, then they will not be
le to fill some of the available
work _ positions, and then
businesses will suffer. Ultimately,
the economy will be affected,”
Dr. Ralph Bangs, co-editor of the
report, said.

The report was released in
September and compiled by Pitt’s
University Center for Social and
Urban Research and edited by
Bangs and Dr. Vijai P..Singh.
Several faculty members and two
local businessmen wrote chapters

‘in the report.

Bangs said that education and
economy work in a cycle because
funds for education are tax—based.

“If the economy falters, then
the schools lose money and that
causes the economy to falter,”
Bangs said.

Students from schools with a
weaker tax base tend to exhibit
lower achievement. The report
suggests that there may be a need
to think about ways to improve
the tax base.

“We started writing chapters in
January, but some of the research
inside has been going on for
more than two years,” Bangs said.
“The report is a community service
and a summary of several reports
of ongoing research.”

According to the report, the
regional economy has greatly
improved in the last two years.
This is attributed to the end of the

decline of manufacturing
employment, continued growth

of the non—manufacturing industry
and rapid expansion of the
advanced technology sector.

Another trend was the
significant growth of employment
in the last two years, which is
higher than the U.S. rate of growth,
and the growth of high-tech jobs.

“We found that the high-tech
industry was hiring people with
no college education, but those
with degrees made much more
money. The best jobs go to those
with an education,” Bangs said.

In order to put the region’s
growth in perspective, Pittsburgh
was compared to two major cities,
Cleveland and Philadelphia,
which Bangs said have similar
economies. *

“Though Pittsburgh has grown,
when the region is compared to
Philadelphia, it is certainly less
diversified and dynamic,” Bangs
said.

Work Studyprograms untapped

By‘ Kathie Roth
The Pitt News

 Work Study has long

ed at Pitt as a form of financial

— ., many students,

especially freshmen, do not

realize the many different beneﬁts

of the program, according to Work
Study office employees.

Work Study is a federally
sponsored type of financial aid
more readily available than grant
money, and is aimed at allowing
ﬁe students to depend upon
themselves. Cynthia DiLucia, the
College Work Study coordinator,
said, “It’s a self-help type of
financial aid. It’s for the student
to have spending money. It’s for
books and supplies.”

Under the program, students

who have been awarded Work
Study may hold one‘ job on the
university payroll at a time. If a
student is unhappy with his
sition or finds it is impossible
nftintain both his studies and

V

a part-time job, he is allowed to
withdraw from the program.
However, the student cannot
change jobs during the semester.
There are approximately 1,000
job listings available through the
Work Study office. While many
of the jobs are clerical in nature,
there are several options which
require more specialized work.
According to DiLucia, if a student
is able to find a a job which can
be applied to his major, the work
can serve as a sort of internship.
Still, many Work Study jobs are
basically elementary.

Almost anyone can meet the
requirements. Admissions
counselor and Work Study
supervisor Lisa Cherok said, “Most
supervisors are willing to teach
[student employees] anything they
have to know, unless it is specified
that experience is necessary.”

Students receive a monthly
paycheck from which only
income taxes are withheld. All of
the pay the student has earned

goes directly to him, not toward
his bill at the university.

The ﬁnancial aid office has
awarded Work Study to about
2,000 students, though only half
of that number have accepted the
offer. DiLucia said, “We’d like to
have about 1,000 on the payroll
for the fall and winter terms.”

Students who had hoped to
receive Work Study but were not
offered it on their financial aid
award letter may still have a
chance to participate in the
program.

In order to do so, students
must fill out all of the financial aid
forms and be judged as having a
financial need. They then should
inquire at the Work Study office.
Though the Work Study office
cannot guarantee a position, it is
a possibility, according to DiLucia.
She said, “Many freshmen are
reluctant to get involved.
Everyone who has been offered
Work Study is urged to come in

ifoung Democrats conﬁdent

By Shawn McClearn
For The Pitt News

Jeff Wisniewski, president of
the College Young Democrats,
expressed confidence in Dan
G‘.ol".en, the Democratic candidate
for the 8th district of the Pittsburgh
City Council, in an interview this
week.

Wisniewski refuted Republican _

candidate Mary Caroline Hunt’s
charge that Cohen had no relevant
experience, pointing out that as a
Azer, Cohen has the necessary
gylexperience and is more than

as

qualified politically due to his
experience with the Dukakis
campaign and his co—founding
of the Democratic Forum of
Pennsylvania, a political
discussion group. Wisniewski also
said that Cohen has lived here
since graduating from law school,
has strong family ties in
Pittsburgh, and is very aware of
public’ issues.
“I think Dan is a very qualified
candidate,” Wisniewski said.
As for Hunt’s assertion that
many Democrats find themselves
closer to Republicans on values

such as the family, Wisniewski
said that he did not understand
her implication, except that
maybe she was implying that the
Democrats were somehow anti-
value and anti-family.
Wisniewski pointed this out as
what he called a “wedge” issue;
that is, a non-issue being used by
Hunt to divert attention away
from the weaknesses of her
campaign and the real issues in
the race for City Council, and that
while Cohen wants to discuss
substantive issues, she continues

Clapp Hall lab

chemical spill  

' _t Jon Anderson/The Pitt News A
Dr. Fredrick Gottlieb, who accidently dropped a toxic
chemical down a Clapp Hall sink.

By Milt Klopfer‘
Staff Writer

A Clapp Hall laboratory was evacuated Wednesday afternoon
when a vial containing a highly toxic chemical was dropped
and broken in a laboratory sink.. a

Dr. Fredrick Gottlieb, Associate Director of the Biological’
Sciences Department, was mixing a solution containing osmium
tetraoxide, a stock solution used in electron microscopy. After
dropping the vial, Gottleib immediately ordered the lab cleared
of students.

“I didn’t give them any choice,” said Gottleib. “I just told them
to leave. Then I shut the door and called the police."

A team from the Pittsburgh Hazardous Materials Unit arrived,
cleaned out the sink, checked the lab for contamination and
sealed the room. The room will remain sealed until tomorrow,
said Bob Aiteshka, a spokesman for University Relations.

According to Gottleib, the solution he was mixing has the
effect of fixing, or suspending biological structures so that they
will not change or react when being studied. The chemical is
potentially fatal, depending on one’s proximity when exposed
to it, he said. a

“The hazardous materials team was here making sure that
nothing happened becuse of an accident," he said. “We were

careful [about the spill} and that was great.”

Nine undergraduate students were in the laboratory with
Gottleib when the accident occured.

‘Playboy Advisor'

discusses

Marcy Lightfoot
For The Pitt News

James Petersen, the Playboy
Advisor who spoke to University
of Pittsburgh students last
evening, descibed himself as a
stand-up sex therapist. ’

Petersen began his lecture by
students about

condoms, masturbation, oral sex,
AIDS and other sex related topics.
Students were asked to write their
questions down if they were
inhibited to ask questions in front
of a group.

Petersen uses humor as a
technique to get his information
across to his audience. “There is
a taboo in America about talking
about sex and some people are
bound to be offended by what I
say but at least I make them
laugh,” Petersen said. He said he
was once descibed as “the
funniest sex expert or the most
sexually informed comedian.”

sexuality

Petersen has been writing an
advice column for “Playboy” for
17 years. The column addresses
not only questions about sex but

about fashion, food and drink,_

stereos and cars. “I think that the
column should be all about sex.
There is not enough information
available about sex,” Petersen
said. “I have a huge respect for
privacy but there needs to be a
somewhere for people to get
easy access to sexual information
and there isn’t.”

Five years ago, Petersen began

giving sexual lectures. He has

lectured at over 120 colleges
across the country.

Petersen said he gets his
information through his eyes and
ears. He reads a lot and discusses
questions with his friends.
Petersen said that writing his
column is “like writing a term
paper every month. It just
happens to be about kinky sex.”

THE Prrr NEWS,

Pulitzer Winning journalist to
discuss Vietnam  experiences

A Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist who saw the Vietnam
War from the rice paddies to the
Pentagon is coming to Pitt to
explain how it all happened.

Neil ‘Sheehan will give an
insider's look at the war, from his
days as a war correspondent in
1962 to his trip this summer to
Vietnam, in a speech at 8 p.m.
Thursday, Oct. 5, in the Assembly
Room of the William Pitt Union.

The appearance is sponsored
by The Student Publications
Board, which also publishes The
Pitt News and the PantberPrmts
yearbook. Tickets are available
at the William Pitt Union ticket
office and are free to Pitt students.
Tickets are also available for $5
to non-students.

Sheehan has been quoted as,
saying that the tragedy of the war
may have been valuable to the
United States. “The Vietnam
veteran brought home a different
kind of wisdom. He learned that
you can fight a bad war, that you
can get killed for nothing, and
that it’s a complicated world.

“This wisdom is necessary to a
country over the long run. In that
sense, Vietnam can be a very

someone else, but you do have
to worry about yourself.”

In addition to freshmen, all
students were invited to attend
the fair, which included

organizations such as Planned I

Parenthood, the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance and Magee-Womens
Hospital. ‘
Marceca said, “Some people
were leery about coming to an
event like this, but they shouldn’t
be. If you have any questions,
you shouldn’t be afraid to ask.”
In addition. to answering
questions, the volunteers from
the Student Health Advisory
Board also gave out free condom
samples and sponsored a “Guess
how many jujubes in the
condom?” contest, the winner
receiving a free box of condoms.
Students from SHAB said that
“a huge» amount of people came
through [the fair] today. We’re
giving them some awareness,” in
addition to the free condoms.
The “Protect Yourself’ seminar
was part of the PPC’s “Sexual
Awareness Day,” which included

the “Love and Sex” lecture by

Playboy Advisor James Petersen.

In addition to “Sexual
Awareness Day,’.’ the PPC plans
to address more. social issues this
year, said Pfeil. “We need to have
more serious topics like this to
help Pitt students.” “We’re

here to help people, and getting
students to be more responsible
about sex is really important,”
said Marceca.

 

 

good experience for Americans,
and to some extent, it already has
been.” 

As the United Press
International correspondent,
Sheehan was one of the first full-
time correspondents in Vietnam.
He later worked for T be New
Yorle Times in Vietnam and‘ in
Washington, D.C.

He obtained a secret
government history of the war.
The publication of the Pentagon
papers created a furor, and won
a Pulitzer Prize for The New Yorle
Times.

In 1972, Sheehan attended the
funeral of John Paul Vann, a
renowned American fighting man
killed in a helicopter crash in
Vietnam. “Sheehan saw at once
that Vann’s life seemed to
symbolize the war.

In one of the most painstaking
report efforts ever, Sheehan spent
16 years writing A Brigbtsbming
Li'e,]obnPaul Vann andAmerica
in Vietnam. This year it won both
the Pulitzer Prize and the National
Book Award. i_

Sheehan discovered that Vann
had a haunted past, including
c_Qrnpi_1I_s_iye_vx;grr_1anizing and a

charge of statutory rape. As a
military man, Vann began as an
idealist, but he gradually lost his
bearings, much as the entire
American effort did.

“The people who know about
Sheehan are very excited,” said
student media adviserjim Tynen,
who is coordinating the
appearance for the publications
board. “He was one of the top
Vietnam correspondents, and his
work on the Pentagon papers is

landmarks in American
journalism.

“His research’ on Vietnam is
perhaps unmatched by anyone.

He has covered not only American ,

history and politics, but also
Vietnam history and politics, plus
the culture and psychology of
both nations. 1 think his speech

will have insights that no one else

could give us at Pitt.”

Education, not Expulsion
Getting caught with drugs outside of school can now
mean expulsion for students in the Pittsburgh School
District. ‘ I
A A little over a week ago, the school board voted to

, enact this policy by a 7-0 vote as a part of a zero
tolerance to drugs and alcohol program. Ronald Suber, '

chairman of the board’s "discipline committee, and
-Superintendent Richard C. Wallace confirmed the rumor

’ that drug-sniffing dogs and undercover agents may be

used in schools to enforce these new rules.
i A If this ppolicy had been enacted at the beginning of the

schoolyear, it is estimated that 30 students would have

alreadybeen sent packing. -
Ironically, board member Jake Milliones believes that

‘ the key to reducing drug use among students is through
education and prevention. programs. ‘

If this is so, then how is the policy of kicking students

I out of school who arecaught using drugs going to

educate them or prevent them,-from using them? If they
aren’t in school any longer, then it is impossible for them

V to benefit from any educational programs on drugs that

are enacted, and the students who are forced to leave

~ are the ones who need such programs the most.

Stopping the use of drug abuse among our ,nation’s
young people is definitely of the utmost importance -—'

they are our future. However, “treating them like crirni-

nals and punishing them for things that are done on their
own time, and not on school grounds, is ludicrous.

If they are arrested for drug violations, shouldn't they
have the opportunity for rehabilitation? Drug education
programs in high school would be part of the curricu-
lum and free to everyone. Why not make these pro-
grams part of probation or sentencing? A

As Mr. Milliones already stated, the way to stop this
problem, as with so many others, is "through education.
Prevention programs in school districts are a good idea.
Drug-sniffing dogs are not.

Lets worry abouttbe born

This letter is in response to the

claim by a pro-life advocate ask— Marshall?

cial support ‘come from, Mr.

ing, “Are pro-choicers hiding
something from us?”[...]

 

A lovely. utopia Mr. Marshall
describes, yet he does not ad-
dress the real problem. Whether

, we like or dislike abortion, it is

here to stay. Women must be
able to decide what do do with
their own bodies. Furthermore,
the President of the United States
was elected on a platform with
the theme of “Read my lip, no
new taxes!” Where will the fman-

My advice to Mr. Marshall is:
let's stop worrying about unborn.
[...l Let's see the beautiful love,
compassion, and ﬁnancial sup-
port directed to those already
living in this country. Perhaps if
the pro-life movement would
direct its time’ and money to the
“born” children of this country,
instead of bombing women's
clinics, this country would be
much better off.

ONQ Quaurieo ‘ﬂ CZTGH
a PaNaMaNiaN oicrarox,

American Values expressed on prime-time

Like, I am just so sorry dude,
but Doogie Howser M.D. is the
hottest show on the tube. It just
stokes today. Or, to address the

L show’s other target audience,

Doogie Howser M.D. is nothing
less than the quintessence of the
'80s mentality.

To let the record speak favora-

bly, this writer would like to

stress that in no way are you
encouraged to "watch this new
television .“dramady.” Unless, of
course, you need to vomit next

’ Wednesday night and happen to

 

be fresh out of syrup of ipecac.
Critically, it can easily be ob-
served and substantiated that the
show is miserable: as a comedy
it’s unfunny, and as a drama it’s
detached. The show isn't even
bad enough to be considered
cheesy enough to be good-— it
just sticks to the screen like the
Cheez Whiz somebody sprayed
on your TV last New Year's. With
this note, it is sad to observe that
the show reflects the society in
which we live. ‘ _
If you haven’t had the opportu-
nity to catch the new show in this
early fall season, allow me to
brief you. Doogie HowserM.D. is

the latest creation of L.A. Law

guru Stephen Bochco. Tackling
the second of our two prized
professions, this show features a
16-year-old doctor. "We are told
that the title’ character scored a
perfect 1600 on his SAT at age
seven, finished high school in

nine weeks, graduated from Prin- '

ceton University at age nine and
is now a practicing medical doc-
tor.

As we follow him on the show,
Doogie is either battling
hormones, saving lives, or hav-
ing a ,“Big Talk” with an adult
about something important.
Sounds killer, huh dude?

Aside from having the most
asinine plot in recent memory,
the show lacks good production
values. Acting seems to be a new
concept to the men and women

reading their scripts; and the

young actor playing Doogie looks

like anything but a doctor. He

looks more like some creature

that appeared in a Weelely World
News exclusive photo essay, and
this writer wouldn’t even bet his

milk money that the pubescent
putz could say his ABCs back-

ward. In fact, it would be less

scary to watch a Civil War movie

where a soldier has his arm
amputated with a rusty saw by a
300-pound nurse, than to watch
this little twerp operate on some-
body. ‘

‘ With such a blistering descrip-

tion ofthe show, it may seem
rash and irrelevant to suggest

that this show is a reﬂection of

I modern-day American attitudes.

First off, the idea of a little guy
being a “Big Professional Stud” is
appealing to mostAmericans. We
live. in an age where you are
considered low on society’s to-

tem pole if you aren’t earning six ‘

figures by the age 28. If you are
doomed to a healthy middle-
class lifestyle, watch out — tele-
vision says you're destined to be
a fat ogre like Roseanne who
lives toeatgreasy food, exchange
sexual comments with a miser-
able husband and have a sink
‘filled with dirty dishes. Unfortu-
nately, Stephen Bochco seems to
have hit the '80s mentality on the
mark -— what_appears to be a
show with a far—fetched story is
surprisingly close to home in its
depiction of current attitudes.
As far as the lousy production
is concerned, the show does well
in exploiting our low standards

in an age where most Americans .

think that the words “art”‘and
“entertainment” do“not belong in
the same paragraphl

Doogie is a mode day hero.
The show is pretentiou , to you
kids out there, a -“quality -show
wanna-be." The show is shot on
film, and before Bochco’s pro-
duction logo graces the screen at
the conclusion, Doogie types
some important idea into his PC
terminal to deliver a message.
Next time, instead of typing some-
thing like, “My life will never be
the same," he ought to type,
“Why do Arnericans continue to

’ NASA. Just

watch this and other garbage that
reeks from television sets and
movie theaters everywhere?” That
would be bold programming.
DoogieHowserM.D. isn’t a good
show as its producers would like
to trick us into thinking — under-

neath its slick facade is a half-.
hour of gutless exploitation. It’s

no wonder that analysts predict it
will be a hit. I ‘

I realize that television has often '

been hokey, and society has never
-approached perfection. It’s just
that there’s something about
watching little Doogie parading
around with his shirt off that

makes me sick. The television -
,mogu1s who shape our vision

seemto be saying, “Yes, this is
cool beans,” and we seem to
agree. . I

With Doogie on theair reﬂect-

ing these hollow '80s ideals, I .

have no alternative but to watch
reruns that remind me of a more
wholesome era. My personal
favorite is Lost in Space.‘ In fact,
space maybe the only place left

for those in search of something,

meaningful or interesting.

Of course, this shouldn't serve
as any comfort — next season
Stephen Bochco may have the
‘script elevate Doogie to head of
imagine the
possibilities! The new show would
be called Rulerof Space. It would
be about the now 17-year-old
“Professional Studmufﬁn”_ who
has climbed to the top here on
earth with such blazing speed
that it has become necessary to
venture into space to get ahead!"
He may even design a Volvo with
rocket ‘engines so that shallow
yuppie astronauts can travel to a

corporate space station to wor-

ship — yup — Doogie! Sorry,
“beautiful people” only.

Hey Stephen baby, do me the
honors -— run with it! The idea's
free in hope that you won't take
me to court for slander (and
realize I only speak the truth).
Meanwhile, this writer will turn
off his television and curl up with

a good book —- and I suggest the ,3

rest of America do the same.

THE PIT!’ NEWS,Thursday, October 5, 1989

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

Dave Minarek, drummer for
the local band The Clarks,
unwrapped a piece of bubblegum
and read his fortune: “What you
think will happen will.”

“Well, if I think only good
things, we’ll be all set,” he
laughed.

But The Clarks don’t have to
think too hard. In the three years
that they've been together, they’ve
already made a name for
themselves here in Pittsburgh
playing in local clubs and opening
up for national acts. Tonight
they're paired up with ex—Plimsoul
member, now solo performer,
Peter Case.

Peter Case’s roots trace back to
performing on street corners in
San Francisco. In the mid—1970s,
he was a member of the short-
lived band called The Nerves, but
it was later in the decade with the
birth and subsequent growth of
the power—pop/rock band The

.Plimsouls that Case gained
notoriety.
The Plimsouls enjoyed

moderate success with their EP
ZeroHourand two studio albums
The Plimsouls and Everywhere At
Once. The latter spawned the hit
single “A Million Miles Away”
and led to a sort of cameo shot
in the classic film Valley Girl.
According to Case, he left The
Plimsouls in 1984 in order to
communicate his ideas more
thoroughly and to improve the
quality of his music. What he did
was mellow out just a bit. Instead

 

of using the raunchy, power-

driven rock that The Plimsouls

produced, Case turned toward

the folkier sound of an acoustic

guitar and harmonica to convey
his messages.

Case admitted that some of the
songs on his latest LP, The Man
With The Blue Postmodern
Fragmented Neo-Traditionalist
Guitar, are bleak, but he pointed
out that they are about hope as
well. He considers this, his second

solo album, happier than his self— 

titled debut.

While Case has gone to great
lengths to voice. his feelings
through simplistic, stripped-
down songs, he believes in a
certain degree of obscurity. Case
has said that he wanted these
lyrics to be open and cause people
to think and examine. Ideally, he
wants people to understand what

it is he’s saying, but also to bring  ”

to the songs their own personal
interpretations.

Case’s earlier work with The
Plimsouls and his latest solo
endeavors have earned him
critical acclaim and the respect of
many, including his opening act
for this evening’s show.

“We kind of idolized The
Plimsouls. I mean, we don't put
them up on a pedestal or anything,
but I think we draw a lot from

bands like The Plimsouls,” said

Minarek. “Some of our newer
stuff has a real folky, acoustic
sound to it, like Peter Case.”
Peter Case and The Clarks will
be bringing their Combinations
of “power-pop”/rock/folk to
Graffiti tonight at 9:30 p.m.

In the early ’80s, it looked like
Mickey Rourke could very well
become a major star. With his

“smooth voice and sly, sleazy
I charm, he was (and is) the

epitome of cool. Since that time
his resume reads as a tribute to
the weird and perverse: the kinky
whipmaster in 9 1/2 Weeles, the
satanic investigator in Angel
Heart, the boozy poet of last
year’s wonderful Barﬂy, etc... .
Roles like these haven't earned
Rourke tons of credibility among
critics or the moviegoing
mainstream, but he’s gained a
deserved cult following. Rourke

‘ makes ﬁlms that are interesting,

even when they’re not that great.
And that’s a good description of

Rourke abandons his trademark
charisma to play a horribly
deformed robber nicknamed
Johnny Handsome. Johnny was
born this way; he’s only known
life as a freak. Johnny’s friend
and mentor Mikey asks him to
help rob a coin shop. Johnny
grudgingly agrees, though he’s
wary of Mikey’s other two mean-
spirited partners, Rafe (Lance
Hendriksen) and his girlfriend
Sunny (Ellen Barkin).

In a cold—blooded robbery
scene, Rafe and Sunny turn on
their partners, killing Mikey and
leaving Johnny for the cops.
Johnny refuses to turn in the
traitors, despite constant
harassment from a cynical
Detective Drones, and goes to
prison.

Scot Ross
Managing Editor

From the outside, Dn'w'ngMiss
Daisyappears less than complex.
Its scenery is simple but effective;
its characters eccentric but
steadfast. Even its employer-
servant relationship plot seems
routine.

However, upon searching
beyond the surface, one unearths
a precious jewel in this Heinz
Hall production of the Alfred
Uhry play.

Awindowpane settles at various
places against the backdrop.
Furniture moves rapidly in and
out during numerous fade—outs,
enhancingan illusion of many
sets. Background music is
abundant. One might assume
director Ron Lagomarsino uses
this myriad of lighting and sets to
shadow either a weak script or
weak cast. Neither is the case, as
Lagomarsino shows a keen eye
and excellent stage manipulation,
using these elements to enhance
the story.

To keep his mother from having
a fatal automobile accident, Boolie
Werthan (Stephen Root) hires
Hoke Coleburn (Brock Peters) to
chauffeur the elderly woman.
Immediate conﬂict results. Miss
Daisy Werthan (Iulie Harris) is
unwilling to accept this assault
upon her competence. However,
Hoke’s insistence and kind
offerings eventually soften her
reluctance and the two embark
on at four—decade-long
relationship, charting not only
the decline of an old woman’s
health, but also a decline in the
racial and social wall between

 

the two characters. r"~

The black-white relationship is
portrayed well by the actors and
is significant in the time period.
As the wheels of civil rights begin
to turn, so does their friendship.

This is best portrayed halfway
through the play, when in the
midst of a traffic jam Hoke informs
Daisy that her Jewish temple has
been destroyed by a bomb ‘
Unnerved by the prejudicial act,
the weeping Daisy is calmed by
Hoke, who tells her that he is
well aware of the effects of racism.
“Why did you tell me that?” Daisy
asks, although she already
understands.

This is masterfully played by
Harris. Where Daisy has been

both prejudiced and persecuted, 

Harris changes her slightly,
allowing the audience to
sympathize with a woman whose
stubbornness is so abrasive.

It is indeed Harris’ lead that
allows the play to blossom. She
accentuates Daisy’s quick
comments and unique perception
of her surroundings. Happily, it is
also done without the unrealistic
cuteness of The Golden Girls’
Estelle Getty. The audience laughs
because the lines are funny any‘).
are delivered as such. It is not
laughter drawn from an elderly
woman talking about ﬂatulence.

Peters is as intriguing as Hoke.
His modest upbringing is a facade
for a we1l—nurtured common
sense. Hoke holds back when
Daisy’s demands are,
uncompromising, although he’)
skillfully does it without a
patronizing tone. Only when
Daisy refuses to allow Hoke to

Current 93
Earth Covers Earth
United Dairies

Among the British occult bands,
the musical emphasis has shifted
from sheer evil darkness to
attempts at pagan folk music.
Droning acoustic guitar and
singsong vocals have recently
appeared on releases from Death
In June, Sol Invictus and Current
95’s Swastileas ForN0ddy, which
was a fairly coherent concept
album.

Now Current 93 has gone whole
hog into the folk thing, forsaking
the black magic for various shades
of green. Too bad their new LP
Earth Covers Earth suffers from
the sameness disease — the same
acoustic guitar line, the same
horrid vocals from David Tibet,’
and the same sugar overdose
from Rose MacDowal1, formerly
of Strawberry Switchblade.

Oh, and did I mention the
same? Yeah, the same childish,
girlie voice represented here by
Catherine Wallis, and the same
obligatory evil nursery rhyme.
The only track even remotely
worth a second listen is
“Hourglass For Abelisk,” a morbid

poem read by Catherine over an

accordion hum provided by
Steven Stapleton, the genius
behind the tape collages of Nurse
With Wound.

Of course, Current 93 has
produced duds before, especially
its ‘ two laughable Christmas
twelve-inches mixing unwanted
disco and pop. But this is a whole
LP’s worth of nothing, giving
considerable evidence that these

Perry McCarty: vocalist for Steve Stevens ' band.

Steve Stevens
Atomic Playboys
Warner Bros.

Since the Whiplash Smilealbum
and subsequent tour with Billy
Idol, Steve Stevens has kept a
low proﬁle while preparing his
official entry’ into the forefront as
both a guitarist and a bandleader
for the Atomic Playboys, his post-
Idol solo project. The group’s
eponymous debut, distributed by
Warner Bros., is without question
a Stevens solo, with the guitarist’s
trademark mix of funk and metal
very prominently featured and in
typically raucous form.

~ One can only speculate at what
might have been produced had
the planned collaboration
between Stevens and bassist Billy
Sheehan taken place; the results,
notwithstanding, are fantastic.
Though the prospect of working
with so distinctive a musician as
Stevens is daunting, vocalist Perry

PITT VS. NOTRE DAME

  TICKET LOTTERY
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1989, TBA
  AT SOUTH BEND)

1. Each person that enters is eligible to receive two tickets.

2. Price of the tickets is $23.00 each.

McCarty does so with class and a
minimum of cliche. The title cut
is a great hard rock song, with
strong rhythm, the “raygun” intro,
and topical lyrics about the
damage done by, well, atomic
playboys. The sampled spoken
prelude clues the listener in
immediately.

Other highlights of this very
fine album include “Soul on Ice,”
an unrestrained guitar showcase
in which Stevens adds a blistering
solo to his atypically rhythmic,
textural playing. And since the
“soul on ice” in question is none
other thanjames Brown, Stevens,
McCarty and especially drummer
Thommy Price get down amid
the screaming chaos all the while
(explain it if you can). The tempo
slows a bit for “Power of
Suggestion,” an R&B number
which might sound out of place
on another album with its purist
blues sound——-more Albert King

Please see Soundings, page 13

Handsome

Continued from page 9

new, handsome face and a new
life. Life is a bed of roses compared
to the old days, butjohnny hasn't
forgotten who betrayed him. And
the tension mounts as we wonder:
will Johnny risk his new life for
the sake of revenge?
Based on the novel The Three
Worlds of ]obnnyHand9ome and
directed by the stylish, cold-
blooded Walter Hill, johnny
Handsome is a very, very dark
and disturbing film. It harks back
to the ﬁlm noir of the ’30s and
'40s. This is the way they must
have made B-films before they
realized they could sell just as
many tickets without interesting

 characters or unique stories.
Hill creates an evil, sleazy .

environment, just as he did in his
shoot—’em—up potboilers (48
Hours, Red Heat). The director
lapses into shameless exploitation

at times, but then again, he

wouldn’t be Walter Hill if he

didn’t.

 

When it comes to plausible
storytelling, the script gets the
job done  just barely. The
supporting characters couldn’t be
more stereotyped. Johnny’s
girlfriend and Doctor Resher think
Johnny’s good at heart. They're
nice. Rafe, Sunny and Detective
Drones thinkJohnny’s a burn and
always will be. ’I'hey’re mean.
One feels pity for smart actors
like Whitaker and Freeman stuck

with such sorry lines. Ellen Barkin ‘

plays her second sinister chick
this month (the other in Sea L_,
Love).

The script calls for naive
psychodrama and Rourke is more
than willing to oblige.

interest and then some. johnny
Handsome is sensational,

ludicrous stuff and it's quite 

potent. You’ll find yourself
affected by the film, fully aware
of its limitations. Mark up another
thrillingly unwholesome movie
for Mickey Rourke.

His 7 A 0.
performance has the kind of , ,
schlocky magic that holds your 7 ' 1}‘

Daisy

Continued from page 10
relieve himself does Hoke defy
Daisy. Hoke, however, does not

take this opportunity to avenge’

all the ribbing he has taken from
Daisy. He calmly walks off and in
the next scene cajoles Boolie into
a raise. This exempliﬁes Peters’
performance. He is
straightforward in his portrayal
and pulls no punches with the
audience. .

Weithan. Where he could simply
fade into the background, given
the strength and size of the two
other parts, Root raises his voice
like a true southerner and holds
steadfast. Boolie declines
invitations to a Martin Luther
King speech because of racial
reasons, which Root states in an
intelligent manner, without
appearing smarmy or insincere.
He views the situation rationally
and allows the character to justify
himself in much the same way.

The audience is not angered by
Boolie, but rather by the forces
that cause the circumstances.
The execution of the play is
enhanced by the talented cast.
Where the characters are unable
to fend for themselves, they are
assisted by others in the troupe.
When the play makes the audience
feel uncomfortable, the cast
members ease the situation,
quenching their curiosity and
eroding their predispositions.

Chicago isn't exactly known as
a hotbed of the avant-garde on
par with New York or San
Francisco, but things have been
getting interesting in the Windy
City in the past few years. One of
the most pleasing developments
has been a group called Fat.
This instrumental trio uses the
standard rock setup of bass, guitar
and drums to craft some rather
un-rockish material bridging the
realms of jazz and noise. The
Canadian label Amok Records,
known mostly for releasing
mediocre lumps of vinyl by
Depeche Mode- lookalikes
Psyche, has apparently acquired
a taste for more unusual music,
and that’s good for your ears.
There may actually be a
connection between Fat and their
fellow Chicago irnprovisors Liof

quite well in combination wit}
the stop—start action on “A Mar

in which the trio plays over a

though). ‘

The group also proves that
their creative vocabulary is
broader than just squonk, as they

Siragusa and Panthers not looking past Temple



Heidi R White/The Pitt News

Tony Siragusa's (98) return to the Pitt line-upafter ayear-long injury has helped the Panthers come together as a team.

Z00/efor om upset-ﬁlled Sunday

(Editor’s Note: Each week, Sports
Editor Chris Bosak, Asst. Sports
I Editor Milee Rampa and a guest
prognosticator will predict the
results of NFL games.)

Chris Bosak
Last Week 10-3
Season 34-18

After a good week like the last
the, I think I can go for some
upsets and be a little risky. After
this week, there won’t be any
teams without either a win or a
loss, except the Lions.

Cincinnati atPittsburgh: The
Steelers are improving (drastically
from the first two weeks), and
they’ve got to still be stinging
from the Bengalsloss three weeks
ago. The Bengals shot off their
_rnouths after that game; bad
I oice. The Steelers with revenge
this week!

Cleveland at Miami: Marino
is coming off of his worst days as
a pro, and Bernie threw his first
interception lastweek, so go with
the better defense. Miami still
dq3sn’t have one. Take the
Browns.

Houston at New England:
The Oilers are on track, and New
England hasn't even seen the

2
l ,

tracks in years. Flutie or not, take
the Oilers.

‘ Bulfaloatlndianapoliszlhate
to go against the Colts, but they’re
too unpredictable. Jim Kelly
seems to have his stuff together,
so the Bills will win, but not big.

Chicago at Tampa Bay: As I
said, no more undefeated teams.
The only way Chicago will go 5-
0 is if they pull out a slimy victory
on a last-second field goal. I
hope it doesn't happen because
the highlights will show Kevin
Butler’s fat face in a helmet that’s
three sizes too small for him.

Dallas at Green Bay: Steve
Walsh will lead the Cowboys to
their first win. Well, actually a
running back named Walker will
do most of the damage. Green

Bay is looking good, but I just .

have to take Dallas once this
year, and this could be my last
chance.

Detroit at Minnesota: Detroit
will remain winless. The Viking
defense is too damned good.

NY Giants at Philadelphia:
The Giants are good, but not that
good. They face a challenge this
week, and the Eagles will soar
over them.

Phoenix atwashington: The
Cardinals have lost two straight,

and the ‘Skins have won two
straight. See a trend there? I do,
and it will continue. a

San Diego at Denver: I want
to take the Chargers, but they’re
playing in Denver. Take the
Broncos with Elway.

Kansas City at Seattle: How
is anybody supposed to pick this?
Who really knows anything about
these teams, and who really cares?
Take the Seahawks, just because.

San Francisco at New
Orleans: Little question, San Fran.
Look for a decent day by Heyward
though.

Atlanta at LA Rams: Upset.
The Rams aren't that good, believe
me. They almost lost to the
Packers a few weeks ago; I didn’t
forget. The Falcons will somehow
make the Rams 4-1.

Mike Rampa
Last Week 9-4
Season 30-22

and so is the Turk, the jungle will
invade the ‘Burgh with a
vengeance. Cincy. ‘

The Pitt football team can
envision great things happening
at the end of the season. They
now. see a 3-0-1 record and are
excited about their
accomplishments so far.

They realize they still have
seven tough games to play before
anything too good can begin to
happen.

It's a long journey to college
football’s promised land. Pitt
defensive tackle Tony Siragusa
feels this team is capable of
making the journey.

On Saturday, the Panthers play
a Temple team that lost to
Houston 65-7 on Saturday.
Temple can easily be labelled a
“pansy” on anyone’s schedule. P

But Siragusa feels the team will
not make the mistake of taking
anyone lightly. '

“The 1989 Pitt Panthers are not
looking past anybody,” said
Siragusa.

Enough said.

Siragusa expects Temple to
come out and play. ‘

Football fans fear that their .

team will look past a weaker
opponent to a future date on the
schedule against a good team
that may decide something in the
end. Siragusa warned everybody
not to look ahead for a change.

“A lot of people look ahead to
other games and they don’t
understand that they’re big games

Record crowd sees
Pitt defeat Griffins
in soccer contest

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team defeated
the Canisius College Golden
Griffins (Buffalo, NY) 2-0 last
night in front of a Pitt Stadium
record crowd of 440 on Youth
Night.

Senior Heinz Pak and
freshman Huy Tran teamed
up on both Panther goals, each
scoring a goal and an assist.
The Panther’s record is now 5-
3-1.

Soccer players from area
youth leagues were admitted
free if they wore their soccer
team shirt;

“We were playing to the
crowd,” said senior midﬁelder
Heinz Pak who had a goal and
an assist. “We’re here to
entertain.”

Pak scored the second
Panther goal of the game with
fifteen minutes remaining in

the second half. It was his first

of the season.

Pak took a sharp lead pass
to the penalty area from Tran
and beat Canisius goalkeeper
Todd White to the far post.
Pak then went into a display
that would have gotten him a
penalty on the ensuing kick-
off in the National Football
League. Pak did a sixty yard
dash back’ to the Panther
bench, went down to one knee
and double clutched his list.
The crowd loved it

Pak played his first full game
at midfield. Although he says
he is playing a defensive
minded midfield, the move
was made by Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher to get Pak into
the offensive attack. It payed
off last night. '

“Heinz created
problems (tonight),"
Luxbacher.

‘Joe gives me time to go
forward and attack," said Pak.

Huy Tran ﬁgured in on the
scoring for the first time this
season.

Tran scored with ten minutes
left in the first half to put the

Panthers on the board.

Pitt had a set play 30 yards from

.the Canisius goal. Junior forward

Mike Blatz sent the ball toward M

the left corner. Pak slipped behind
the defensive wall and took a
shot on White who came out of
the net to get a leg on the ball.
The rebound came right back to
Pak and he sent a pass in the air
to Huy who put an easy header
into the empty goal.

5 The Panthers teased the crowd
with many break-away chances,
but Pitt was offside each time. Pitt
could not get by Canisius’ offside

‘ trap.

“They tried to trap us a lot,”
said coach Luxbacher. “We were
just getting caught (offside) a lot.
We were just a fraction offside.”

 

“We didn't play great
offensively, but'they’re not a bad
team.”

Senior co-captain Sam Lanza
returned to the line-up. Lanza
missed four games with a sprained
left knee.

Lanza started the game and
was able to play with 100 percent
effort.

“The knee feels pretty good,”
said Lanza. “ I feel like I got into
my game.” ’

Lanza also said he suffered a
slightly broken nose in practice
on Tuesday. But he said that did
not affect him. I A

“I’ve had a little bad luck with‘
injuries," added Lanza. I

Pitt’s next game is Saturday
afternoon at national power Seton

Hall.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, October 5, 1989

Siragusa
Continued from page 15
saying that these games are small,

but you got to win them all.”

“We are going to have [to]
focus in on our job. We are
respecting everybody."

Talk of winning all of the games
creates talk of extremely high
goals. The ’89 Panthers have set
higher goals than most Panther
teams over the past decade.

This team, although it is still

early, has even mentioned that

ultimate, scary, mythical-phrase.
Its initials are: ‘
N-A-T-I-O-N-A-L
C-H—A-M-P-I-O-N-S-H-l—P
Siragusa thinks the tie against
West Virginia will not hurt the
Panther’s chances at college
football supremacy. A
“We wanted to go undefeated,
and we still can. A tie isn’t a loss
and it isn’t a win. It shows that
you were there. You can only be
happy with [the 3-0-1 record].
The ‘3-0’ is awesome but the ‘1’ is
‘... and one.’ I’d1ike to be 4-0, but
the guys are [still] excited.”
In order to be at the top in the
end, the team knows it cannot

afford ‘to have a letdown to a‘

weaker team on the schedule,
like Temple. If they want to go
11-0-1, they know that means
zero letdowns. ’
Siragusa does not expect a

defensive letdown.

“Our defense is dominant. We
come out to play. We don’t care

if we play against Schenley High
School. We're coming out to
play-” .

But they can only play one
game at a time. Only Temple is
on the minds of the Panthers
right now.

“We practice like we’re
practicing for the best team in the
country, like this is our national
championship game. If we beat
everybody from here on in we’ll
be [number] one!”

A team that wishes to win every
game must adjust every week.

' Last week the Panthers played in

front of 70,000 rowdy hoopies.

This week they are expected to

play in front of 50,000 empty
seats at Veterans Stadium. .
“Ten years from now when

they look back in the history '

books and talk about this year,
they’re not going to say, ‘How
many fans were at the game?’

They're going to say, ‘Did they

win or did they lose?”

In order to win, Pitt must shut N

down Temple running back

Ventres Stevenson, who leads‘

the offense with 467 _ yards
rushing. He is averaging 4.8 yards
per carry. Split end Rich Drayton
lead the Owls with 14 receptions
for 137 yards. Flanker Kevin
McCoy has 159 yards on 1 1
receptions. Temple quarterbacks

' have completed just 65 of 154

passes for 632 yards. The Temple
offense has scored just 37 points

in ﬁve games.

As far as defense is concerned,
Temple's seems not to exist at
times. They have just one
interception and one fumble
recovery. They have also let up
204 points in their five games.

Against Houston last week, the .

Owls used six defensive backs in
order to stop their “run and shoot
offense.” Temple head coachjerry
Berndt said he wouldn’t hesitate

to use that defense against Pitt.

The Temple defense does have

senior linebacker Loranzo Square.
Square has 54 tackles, - one
interception, and two sacks. As a
team, Temple has 15 sacks.

win.

San Diego at Denver: Burt
Grossman’s vision ofa swimming

Phoenix isn’t just because of the
heat. Don't worry, Burt, it’s a lot

cooler in Denver. Not that it will ;i

Kansas City at Seattle: Really,

been mediocre ever since I can

San Francisco at New

surprising 1-3. This will be a
great game to watch. Another
win for the 49ers, but this one
won’t be easy.

look real tough. If you're looking
for a close game, this ain’t it.
