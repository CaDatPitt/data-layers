Alzheimer’s ride rolls through Schenley

Mallory Grossman
Staﬁ” Writer

A trio of cyclists stopped ‘in Schenley Plaza

Tuesday afternoon as part of the last leg

of a transcontinental journey to promote
, Alzheimer’s research.

Michael Darrah, Bill Lynch and Bruce
Lamb are part of the Alzheimer’s Break-
through.Ride, a relay of 55 researchers
biking 4,500 miles across the country to
collect 100,000 signatures to promote Al-
zheimer’s research.

The ride made its third to last stop
in Oakland, having gathered more than
99,000 signatures collected so far. The
cyclists will end their journey next week
at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., where
they will present the petition to Congress
in an effort to make Alzheimer’s research
a top priority.

Pitt has been a center of research on

the debilitating brain disease. Research-

ers at the university’s Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center have published almost 100
papers on the disease in the past ﬁve years.
William Klunk, co-director of the center,
and fellow researcher Chester Mathis were
also recently featured in the HBO documen-
tary, “The Alzheimer’s Project.”

' Klunk said Pitt students should be both

concerned and aware about the prevalence .

of Alzheimer’s, even though it tends to hit
senior citizens.

Angela Geiger, the chief strategy oﬂ‘icer_

of the Alzheimer’s Association and a Pitt
alumna, agreed. She said Pitt researchers
have played a large role in the eyes of the
Alzheimer’s Association. I

One in eight baby boomers will develop
Alzheimer’s, a generation that includes
most of the parents of current Pitt students,
Geiger said.

“Look in the mirror tomorrow'morn—
ing,'because you and I are the epidemic,”
Klunk said to about 60 people gathered in

the plaza to support the riders. “It’s not out

there, it’s in the mirror.”

For every ﬁve years that a person lives,
his chances of getting Alzheimer’s greatly
increases, Klunk said.

This could potentially become a ﬁnan-
cial and emotional burden for Pitt students,
Geiger said. Caring for an Alzheimer’s pa-
tient requires extensive physical and mon-

etary sacriﬁces, she said.

Lamb, a researcher and event planner,
told the people in the crowd that they need
to make sure Congress hears their voices.

The Breakthrough Ride began July 17
in San Francisco, and willtravel through
65 congressional districts before stopping
in Washington, D.C. The riders will pres-
ent the signatures to Congress on Sept. 21,
which is World Alzheimer’s Day.

The group is pushing to improve care

for Alzheimer’s patients and caregivers, ‘

increase funding for research and convince
Congress. to formalize plans for ﬁghting

Romeus
to have
surgery

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

There have been questions and rumors
surrounding Pitt’s star defensive end

Greg Romeus’ health for several weeks, _

but now it’s official: Romeus, a senior,

will undergo back surgery on Thurs— S

day.

“Our top priority is doing what is best
for Greg,” head coach Dave Wannstedt
said in a statement. “After consulting
with him, his family and our medical
staff, it was determined that immediate
surgery is the best option for Greg both

' personally and athletically.”

Last year, Romeus notched 43 tackles,
11.5 of which were for losses, and led the
team in sacks with eight.

Those stats, with the addition of
three forced fumbles, an interception,
a fumble recovery and a blocked extra

point attempt, earned him high praises

from both the Big East and the national
media.

He was a unanimous first team All-
Big East selection as well as a finalist
for the Ted Hendricks Defensive End of
the Year Award —— TCU’s jerry Hughes
won the award.

He was also selected for three differ-
ent All-America teams: CollegeFootball~
News.com, Sporting News and Rivals.

The national spotlight got the atten-
tion of some NFL scouts, and Romeus has
high prospects for the 2011 NFL Draft.

CBS Sports has him ranked as the No.
30 overall prospect in this year’s class.

Romeus played in Pitt’s first game at

Utah and tallied four tackles, but he was i

absent for Pitt’s home game against. New
Hampshire on Saturday.

In the post-game press conference,
Wannstedt said Romeus went home to
Florida for “personal reasons.”

But Wannstedt remained hopeful
Tuesday that Romeus will return for

' the Panthers.

“We expect him to have a full recov-
ery and return for the conclusion of the

season,” Wannstedt said.I

Corrections:

An article in Monday’s paper, “The infa-
mous Mr. Mathers,” incorrectly stated

. the song in which rapper Eminem used

voicemails he claims are from Mariah
Carey. He included them in a song “The
Warning.” It also incorrectly stated the
number of albums he produced. T/9e
Eminem S/Joux was his fourth album.

Also, an article published last week,
“SGB member resigns,” incorrectly
stated where former board member
Ali Noorbaksh stated his reasons for
leaving. He expressed them after the
group’s meeting. The Pitt News regrets
the errors.

SGB set to add new members

_ Gwenn Barney
Staff Writer

One week after Ali Noorbaksh’s sudden
resignation, SGB resumed business as
usual last night in Nordy’s Place in‘ the
William Pitt Union.

The meeting was the Board’s second
of the semester and the agenda includ-
ed discussion about a New York Times
college readership initiative, the Green
Fund and normal allocations business. It

President Charlie Shull said the process
to fill out the Board is on schedule.
Both N oorbaksh and former member
‘Phil LaRue left the Board earlier this
year. Shull and the other Board members
have distributed 20 applications for the
positions and received two completed
forms. - '
Following the meeting, Shull said he

students who returned completed forms.
The forms are locked up in the-SGB of-

not immediately available.

Shull also announced during the
meeting that he plans to give up his New

if he doesn’t ﬁnd more support for the
resolution in the near future.

“The Board thinks papers are a dying
breed,” Shull said. “The general opinion
is that $30,000 could be spent on bet-
ter means.”

More funding needed

Alzheimer’s 4 1

the disease.

One ironic point, Klunk said, is that
funding for cancer research has done so
much to cure the disease that people are
living longer, increasing their chances of
developing Alzheimer’s.

“You can’t just keep the body alive, you
need to bring the brain with it,” Klunk
said. ‘

Alzheimer’s Association members said
that for every $25,000 the federal govern-
ment spends on care for people with Al-
zheimer’s, it spends only $100 on research

for the disease.

Klunk proposed two solutions to com-
bat the rising costs of Alzheimer’s and the
increasing number of people who suffer
from the disease.

“Either we all die soon, or we make it so
that not as many people have Alzheimer’s,”
he said. I

The Alzheimer’s Association wants to
solve,-the problem by making research on

1 the disease a national priority.

“There are 5.3 million voices that need
to be heard,” Klunk said. I

Green Fund pilot under way

SGB<2

During the meeting, Board member
Molly Stieber announced that the Green
Fund pilot program is underway. She
noted that there will be a change in the
original Green Fund Resolution since it
was drawn up by LaRue.

Shull said the Board
will question all  
applicants at next
week’s meeting.

The original resolution proposed that
a Student Sustainable Projects Commit-
tee would decide what green projects
would be fundedthrough the $8o—per-
term Student Activities Fee, and then
allocate funds for those projects.

Now the committee will only choose
the projects and leave allocations up to
SGB. ‘ ‘

The Board also reiterated its contin-
ued plans to bring a Green Room to Pitt,
similar to one already in place at CMU.
The proposed Green Room will be a re-
cycling area for many types of difficult-
to—recycle goods, including batteries

and light bulbs.

The Board also heard a number of
requests for allocations.

Board members approved alloca-
tions of $525 to the Panther Paintball
Club for participation in a fall tourna-
ment. They also granted the Mock Trial
Team permission to alter its budget, and
the Ambassadors of Christ organiza-
tion received allocations of $760 for a
speaker.

The Chinese Martial Arts Association
presented its case to the Board last night
in hopes of attending a tournament. The
Board denied the association’s request
for $1,095because the members would be
participating as individuals and could not
register as a team representing Pitt.

“If you don’t compete as a team, this
is considered a personal expense,” Shull
said. I

Get on the Internet
weight-loss plan

The Internet has a way of removing social
obstacles. Whether writing status updates
on social networking sites — anonymous
or not — or composing e—mails, people
in an online community take risks they
normally wouldn’t take in person.

As everyone should know by now, re-
moving certain obstacles can end in trag-
edy — take for example electronic harass-
ment and Internet—facilitated criminal
activity. But opening people up to take
risks is not always a bad thing. In fact, giv-
ing people a shelter of silicon chips and
copper wires can empower them to make
great decisions they otherwise wouldn’t
—— like losing weight.

Enter online weight—management
courses.

An article in this week’s Chronicle of A

Higher Education describes new reasons
college students are finding to shed extra
pounds and maintain healthy bodies. The
article highlights a popular weight-loss

_ program started two years ago at the Uni-
versity of Texas at Arlington. Students

who enroll in the online “Exercise and
Weight Management” course set personal
weight goals, blog about reaching those
goals and get a grade’ at the end of the
semester. ‘

In terms of brilliant courses that war-
rant copying-and-pasting on other col-
lege campuses, Texas might have struck
gold.

For one, an individual’s health is often
a personal issue, anddisplaying one’s
health in public —— by, for example, meet-
ing weekly with 30 others for a weight
management course —' can be uncom-

fortable. So uncomfortable that many
might not bother to Seek health guidance
altogether. ‘

As Christopher Ray, a University of
Texas kinesiology professor quoted by

the Chronicle, said, “The students who . :-

were most in need of weight-management
help were probably the students who were
most reluctant to come to face—to-face
classes.”

What the course does best is offer valu-

able guidance to students who naturally a

desire a healthier body but don’t want to
shout out their desire in front of throngs
of others.

The anonymity of participation is one
powerful incentive this course introduces;
another is the grades.

The GPA is a great running buddy,
though don’t trust it to spot you on the
bench press. »

Performing well in class is a major_

driving force behind the activities of most

_ students, at least th'e devoted ones. And

it’s an ingenious way to help students

meet their self-developed weight loss

goals. ,
For those who see incentivizing healthy
habits with transcript—affecting grades
as an unholy intrusion of Big Brother
University’s values into the lives of its
independent students, remember, at U
Texas-Arlington the class is an elective,
and nevertheless enrollment is popping
at its seams. - ’
If more higher education institutions

. inaugurate similar programs, the cause

of college students’ health will take a step
forward. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To The Editor,

 

This letter is in response to The Pitt News ’

article “The Infamous Mr. Mathers.”

While the article begins as a story
about positions on this week’s Billboard
Chart, it quickly turns into paragraphs
that bounce from topic to topic in an
attempt to discredit Eminem as a rel-
evant artist and to question the level of
‘respect that he receives fromhis hip-
hop peers. ‘

The author states,‘ “Those who follow
rap closely would never include Slim on
a list with Lil Wayne orJay—Z.”

Not only is Eminem on the list, he was
voted “Best Rapper Alive” in a 2008 Vibe
Magazine online poll that tallied more
than 920,000 votes.

Eminem is also the top-selling artist
of the decade and won two awards during
Sunday’s VMAs for Best Hip—Hop Video
and Best Male Video.

These accolades reﬂect the same ‘ad-

miration that the average hip—hop lis-
tener has for Eminem.

While the author finds it “hard to be-
lieve that Eminem is in the same league
as”_]ay-Z, Lil Wayne, Kanye West and T.I.,
Eminem has" collaborated with each of the
four artists, including multiple projects
withJay—Z and Lil Wayne. It’s also hard to
believe that the author missed the strong
media ‘coverage of Eminem’s mini-tour
with Jay-Z that concluded on Monday.

The article not only showcases how
out of touch the author is with popular
music, it also includes several mix-ups

‘and errors. .
I would expect to see this article,"

seemingly pieced together through
Google searches and the author’s own
bias, on a personal blog but not in the
A&E section of The Pitt News.

MOUSTACHE CLUB OF AMERICA

Want Armani suits? Go to law school

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

After you’ve been in college for a long time,
you’ll probably decide you want to spend
a few more years there. Times are tough
out in the real world, and the prospect of
continued late-night pizza, free gym ac-
cess and Thirsty’ Thursdays has an obvious
appeal. If you can’t land that coveted spot
on an MTV reality show, graduate school
might be the place for you. ‘

One of the best things about graduate
school is that you can study any old sub-
ject you please as  as you’re willing to
take out lots of loans If-you enjoy popular
shows like “Judging Amy” or “Ally McBeal,”
law school should right up your alley.
You’ll learn all kinds of neat things about
the legal system, such as how to get a wit-
ness to confess on the stand while uncov-
ering a government conspiracy. Since all
lawyers wear Armani suits and earn well
over $1 million per year, law sch_ool is a
really safe bet. i

Business school is _a great place for all
you go-getters and try-harders._Former
president Calvin Coolidge once remarked

that “the business of America is business,”
and who‘ can argue with that? In business
school, you’ll have a chance to learn about
networking, synergy, proactivity, success
and the many other skills you’ll need to
dupe your fellow citizens into buying
whatever new-and—improved breakfast
"cola your company sells. If you like shak-
ing hands, maintaining your day planner
and checking e-mail on your smartphone,
you should definitely consider getting an
MBA.

Social work and education are good
ﬁelds if you’re interested in helping the
less fortunate. Helping the less fortunate is
something that the American middle class
claims it has been doing for the past 100
years, so those of you_.choosing one of these

options will be partiof a rich. tradition. '

These programs are wise choices if you’re
a starry-eyed idealist who is in need of a
quick dose of reality that will transform
you into a ﬂint-eyed'cynic. They’re also
‘composed primarily of single ladies, so you

swinging dudes should think about ﬁringq

off some applications before pinning your
hopes_on riskier propositions like Match.
com and “The Bachelor.”

Medical school is considered by most
experts to be the queen of the professional

schools. This is where the big brains go,
and they have nothing but good things
to say about it. Although it takes nearly
15 years of sleep deprivation to become
a doctor,"this is a glamorous profession
dominated by some of the best celebri-
ties in the country. Dr. Oz, Dr. Phil and Dr.
Gregory House are just a few of the legend-
ary doctors to come down the pipeline in

h the last decade. Could you be next?

If you’re really against greed, selling
out and other nasty things that grown—ups
love, you should enroll in a Ph.D. program
in the liberal arts. These programs, which
can take over 40 years to complete, are a
cheap way to warehouse America’s laziest
young people. Ph.D.s are offered in a vari-
ety of subjects, and quite often the schools
you’re applying to will pay you a starvation
wage‘ if you agree to teach their younger,
even lazier undergraduates.

The best Ph.D. programs are the ones
that have the word “studies” in their titles.
When you see “studies.” at the end of some
department name, like Robot Studies or
Meso-Pennsylvania Studies, you can rest
assured that studying is the last thing
you’ll be doing if you’re admitted. Instead,
you’ll focus on theory, which is kind of like
knowledge for people who love buzzwords

but don’t want to read anything. Ten or
15 years in a studies program might not
earn you enough jack to buy a house fit for
“MTV Cribs” or even a house large enough
to contain a baby’s crib, but you will leave
knowing a phallocentric, Other—ized aporia
when you see one.

Once you decide on the program of your
dreams, you’re going to need to write the
personal statement of a lifetime. Thatis
where the Moustache Column of America
comes in, and that’s why this column is a
two-parter. ' -

Next week, we’ll talk about the killer
themes —-— dead parents, an abusive child-
hood, overcoming a trendy disability, find-
ing yourself while vacationing in India or
any other story you made up after reading
one of the selections in 0prah’s book club

Ground Zero mosque

Steve Kaszycki
Columnist

Sometimes the most scalding of hot-but-
ton issues can be solved with a little bit
of cold water and cool heads.

The planned Islamic cultural center
near Ground Zero in New York has at-
tracted feverish attention, with vehement
criticisms and equally vehement defenses.
But while voices have labeled the affair
everything froman attempt to build a
“victory mosque” to a “First Amendment
crisis,” the involved parties would be far
better off sitting down and reaching a
compromise. .,

. Feisal Abdul Rauf, the leader of the
project, has described the cultural center
as a way to promote understanding and
better relations between American Mus-
lims and non-Muslims, saying, “The fact

that there has been this misunderstanding I

shows the need for the project.” Critics
have found the defenses of the project to
be dubious. Conservative writer James
Pinkerton, amongst others, labeled the
project an example_ of “Islamic Trium-

phalism.” The Heritage-Foundation’s Conn
Carroll, conversely, labeled it a publicity
stunt designed to attract funding from
wealthy Muslims. I’m disinclined to be-
lieve that Rauf didrnot think that there
would be massive public reticence about
the project, nor do I believe him to be
secretly supporting Islamic terrorism, as
some have hinted. .
Even if we take Rauf at his word, we
have ample reason to encourage him to
change his plans. Simply put, the goal
of getting public approval for the proj-

ect is unattainable. Sixty-eight percent

of Americans, 61 percent of the,state’s

residents, and a majority ofthe city’s 7

residents oppose the project, while just
29 percent of Americans support it, ac-
cording to CNN. It’s not a partisan wedge
issue, either: Republicans, Democrats and
Independents all oppose the project. A

, variety of figures, including American

University’s Islamic Culture Studies chair
Akbar Ahmed and the Anti—Defamation
League, have voiced opposition to the
project, appealing to Rauf’s group to con-
sider the feelings ofthe families of 9/11
victims and the nation.

: , One need only imagine the response of

should move , kindly

Bosnian Muslims to a hypothetical Ser-
bian Orthodox Church Cultural Center in
Srebrenica, the site of a massacre of Bos-
nians, or a hypotheticaljapanese cultural
center in Nanjing, China.

Yes, there would be public outcry, and

. whether or not you agree with it, you

should at least not dismiss opposition as
bigotry. Such denunciations are insensi-
tive and irresponsible, as they essentially
call a majority of New Yorkers and the
families of 9/11 victims bigots, in spite

, of the fact that they are not advocating

a ban on Islamic cultural centers. On the
contrary, many are fully supportive of an
Islamic cultural center, they merely ask
that it be built somewhere else. These
people are not bigots any more than Bos-
nian Muslims or" Chinese citizens would
be for opposing a similarly ill—conceived
project;

The religion of Islam isn’t responsible
for 9/11 any more than the Serbian Ortho-
dox Church is responsible for the killings
in Srebrenica. And American Muslims
aren’t responsible for the attacks anymore
than Japanese-Americans were respon-
sible for Pearl Harbor or the atrocities
committed in China. But that’s not the

issue. When a Carmelite nun project near
Auschwitz was met with resistance by
Jewish groups, the Pope did not respond
by calling the families of Holocaust vic-
tims bigots for their opposition — rather,
he asked them to move the project. The
project wasn’t ignoble, it was simply ill-
conceived. Reasonable people reached a
reasonable conclusion: It simply wasn’t
the right place.

Critics, too, should be reasonable. Rauf
has been on record stating some contro-
versial views, calling the United States an

I “accessory to the ‘crime that happened [on

9/11].” Such statements are insensitive but
do not make him a supporter of terrorism
anymore than Pat Robertson’s similarly
insensitive statements following multiple
disasters make him fans of earthquakes
or tsunamis. I

We as a country should welcome ges-
tures that promote productive interfaith
dialogue and relations. If Rauf wants to
be part of that dialogue, he should do
more listening and less talking, respect
the wishes of New Yorkers and the nation,
and choose a different location.

Store makes eeo-smart art

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staff Writer

Artzebo Creations
26 Southern Avenue, Mt. Washington
M, Tu, Th: 10-6; W-F: 12-8 p.m.

Community interaction, recycling, local
artists and even delightful aromas: Desiree
Reicosky’s new Mt. Washington art store
ArtZebo is a blend of all those things.

Reicosky’s store, which opened early last
month, offers a variety of goods including
from handcrafted jewelry, mixed media art,
and her own aromatherapy candles.

To encourage interaction between local
artists and the community, Reicosky created
an artists’ table at the front of her store with

sketchbooks and art supplies. The artists
whose work is soldin her shop often come
in to work there, and anyone is welcome
to sit and draw or paint — Reicosky even
hangs some of her customers’ work in the
window. I

“I try to make it solthat when an artist is
in here doing something, anyone who comes
in can see them and ask questions, which
gives them a feel for what goes into making
the products that are sold here. It makes
us a little bit different than other shops,”
Reicosky said.

Reicosky said she hopes to one day open
a community art center to further support
these interactions and considers the artist
table the ﬁrst step in that endeavor. T

“I think that if I really want to be involved

with the community I have to start as soon I -

as possible. A lot of these artists are hidden
in the woodwork, and I want-people to know
that they are here,” she said. ’

Many artists became involved with Art-
Zebo through the Saturday art marketplace
held during the summer in Mt. Washington,
but Reicosky had to be more creative to reach
out to others. I, l

“I went to buildings where I had seen
people painting outside and asked if they’d
like to participate. There are places in my
neighborhood where there’s paint on the
sidewalk and you know someone has been
working on their art there, so I would put
ﬂiers in their mailboxes. I got quite a few
peopleinvolved that way,” shesaid.

becoming self-aware. It’s, only when art follows
suit that we should really wony.

In a short story entitled “Title,” postmodern ‘

writerjohn Barth glumly speculates that art fol-
lows a terminal trajectory: from invention and
robustness, to ‘crippling self—consciousness to,
ﬁnally, blankness. When the possibilities of an
artform have beenexhausted, Barth suggests, the
art falls back in on itself, re—imagining previous
works until even this exercise grows stale and it
ﬁzzles into nothing. I

As mucli"?a‘sI hateto admitit, Barth mayhave
been onto something. i _

In the past decade, music, books and movies
have become increasingly self-aware, absorbed

defy you to watch two of this year’s most—buzzed
aboutﬁlms, “Kick-Ass” and‘-‘ScottPilgriIn‘vs. The
World,” both of which seem to contain enough
references to ﬁll an encyclopedia. .

Believe it or not, these media—savvy movies
have a name. They’re called metaﬁlms, or “mov—
ies about movies.” In an article for the blog/ﬁlm
entitled, “The Rise of Self-Avvareness in Cinema:
Is Film Doomedto Become aMockery of Itself?”
b1oggerAdam Quigley gives the metaﬁlmtrenda

recentparodies ortributes to less self-conscious
source material: “zombieland,” “lndiariajones
and the Kingdom of tile Crystal Skull,” “Tropic
Thunder,”“Vampires Suck” and eventhis month’s
“Machete.”

As the list demonstrates, today’s ﬁlms are
reﬂectingless and less on external human experi-
ence and more on the history and quirks of the
medium itself, while the alternative —— sincere
stories without any winks to their cinematic
predecessors —— are becoming increasingly en-
dangered. '

Where the value of self-consciousness ﬁrst i
arose is hard to say, but if there’s one directorto '

Reicosky crafts soy candles with aro-
matherapeutic essences as wejllas all-natural
soaps, bubble baths and sprays. She said
that she began working with essential oils

her daughter who suffers from allergies and
asthma. l - _

“I worked on incorporating essential oils
into candles as naturally as possible, with soy
and cotton wicks, so people with allergies
like my daughter can use them,” she said.

Reicosky comes in to her store early to
work on her candles and custom orders but
said that she also likes to make small batches
of-candles throughout the day because their
aroma carries outside. “People say they make

While searching for a supply warehouse
that offered the quality of materials she need-

she donates 5 percent of her supply cost to

warehouse matches her donation.

marks. Ifthere is aﬁlmic equivalent to “sampling,”
Tarantino has done it— he is the pioneer of pop-
culture reference, the champion of reimagining.
For instance, his double-feature collaboration
with Robert Rodriguez, “Grindhouse,” seizes
the aesthetic of the 1970s exploitation ﬁlms for a
“ tongue—and—cheek romp. Only abit more subtly,
“Pulp Fiction” is a brainy but bloody tribute to
its title genre. _
Whether this “sampling” is commendable,
however, is almost beside the point. The larger,
more terrifying question is, does this signal the

beginning of the end? Can an artform be exhaust-
ed like a joke orasun or, come tothink of it, pretty
much everything else? Will it inevitably retreatto
blankness, aflatline on the ﬁlmic EKG?
That’s hard to say. There is no majorartform
I can think of that’s actually gone “blank” —— a
total absence of substance —though nearly every
one of them has become more referential — see
Jorge Luis Borges, LCD Soundsystem. In ﬁlm,
as in other mediums, it’s vexing to ponder what
will come after the already diluted metaﬁlm. Will
there be metameta ﬁlms? Movies about movies

about movies? It’s the sort of hall—of-mirrors
effect that makes your head hurt, and it’s not
too hard to imagine that, instead of this layered
oblivion, art could collapse into sheer nothing-
ness, wholly spent.

THROWING A KIRSCH BALL

Durant   

NBA’s
class act

Lauren Kirschman

 

This NBA offseason, LeBron James used
an hour—long ESPN special to announce
“The Decision” to “take his talents to South
Beach.” ‘ -

Then Dan Gilbert went off on howJames
deserted Cleveland and quit on the team in
the playoffs. >

Then James, Dwyane Wade and Chris

' Bosh pranced around in their uniforms on

a smoky stage in Florida, while experts de-

batedwhether the Heat should just be de5li

clared the NBA Champions now, or ifJames
and Wade would have to split up when they
realized there was only one basketball, and
they’d have to share it.

And whileJames used the rest of the sum-
mer to sit‘around thinking of more ways
to make the entire sports world revolve
around him, Kevin Durant quietly won a
world championship, making the United
States the ﬁrst team to qualify for the 2012
Olympics. 7

How refreshing.

Durant might be four years younger thaiis’
James, but he’s light-years more mature. Not
to mention likeable. And humble.

UnlikeJames, Durant didn’t need a tele-
vision special to announce his offseason
decisions, he simply signed his contract
extension, then tweeted about his choice.qa»

James wasn’t interested in playing with
Team USA’s “B-Team” this summer, but per-
haps he should have been. It couldn’t have
hurt his image, 'that’s for sure. And when
James ‘does rejoin Team USA, he —— as well
as-Wade and Kobe Bryant, for that matter -

. might be surprised to ﬁnd that the spotligli?‘

got a little bit more crowded. . 1: ‘ _

If his play before this summer didn’t
put him in the conversation, Durant’s per-
formance in the world championships ce-
mented his place in the ‘endless discussion

Duranta lock for 2012

Kirschman < 11

and along the way he broke the record for
most points scored in the tournament by a
U.S. player and won the tournament’s Most
Valuable Player award.

He scored 33, 38 and 28 points in the
United States’ last three games against Rus-
sia, Lithuania and Turkey, respectively.

His 38 points against Lithuania set
another U.S. record for most points in a
single game, passing Carmelo Anthony’s
mark of 35. He hit a tournament—record
seven 3—pointers in the championship game
against Turkey. ,

Durant agreed to play in the World
Championships when the gold medalists
from the 2008 Olympics said no. In the
end, Durant and the so-called “B-Team” did
what the “A—Team” couldn’t do four years
ago —-— they brought home gold. And the
21-year-old proliﬁc scorer led it in spec-
tacular fashion.

, There will deﬁnitely be a place for Durant
on the Olympic team for London in 2012.

If his performance in the world champi-
onships is any indication, NBA fans ——- and
Oklahoma City fans, in particular — have
plenty to look forward to this season. Du-
rant ﬁnished second to James in MVP voting
last season, but with the leadership experi-
ence he gained over the summer, that award
could end up in Durant’s hands at the end

corn:-A-.9 o-1:-on

‘  MCT Campus
Lakers star Kobe Bryant tries to steal the ball from Oklahoma City’s Kevin Durant. Durant
has quietly become one of the classiest superstars in the game, unlike LeBron]ames.

After all, James and Wade — not to men-
tion Bosh —— will have their hands full bat-
tling for the Most Valuable Player on their
own team, let alone in the league.

Who’s not anxious to see how that colli-
sion of egos works out? .

Durant has improved each year he’s been
in the league and with improvement comes

‘expectations and demands for better play,

more wins and eventually, a championship.
Right now, he’s an under—the—radar super-
star, but that’ll soon change.

When Durant does win an NBA Champi-
onship, and what I believe will be champi-
onships, I hope he remains the same kind
of person off the court that he is now: a
player who talks more about the team than
himself and who wrote “9—11—01” on his
shoes before the United States’ game on
September 11. V

With the stardom about to rush his way,
it wouldn’t be shocking for Durant to start
to crave attention much likejames and Bry-
ant. A w -

At the moment, though, for a player so
focused and deadly on the court, Durant
reverts back into a quiet, modest and polite
young man off the ﬂoor.

It’s a shocking thing to see from an NBA 1

superstar. _ .
Here’s hoping thefame won’t change

him. ﬂ

did a goodjob ﬁnishing the ball.”

It was the 11th goal of Cuba’s career,
which places her sixth on Pitt’s all—time
list.

Kephart had several impressive saves
down the stretch for the Panthers, includ-
ing a diving stop with 12 minutes remain-
ing and leaving her feet to prevent a goal
with five minutes left. p

But Kent State’s Jessacca Gironda
slipped one by Kephart into the right side
of the goal in the 88th minute off a pass
from Kelly Heaton, tying the game and
eventually sending it into the overtime.

“It was disappointing that we didn’t
close the game out,” Chin said. “We didn’t
take care of the ball and do the proper
things to get the win. We got panicky to-
ward the end.”

She said goalkeeper Kephart has had
an up—and-down season thus far.

“She’s been a little inconsistent. She’s
still ﬁnding her way,” she said. ,“She hurt
her ankle in North Carolina so she’s been
hampered by that a bit. She’s disappointed
with her performance this year, but I have
confidence that she’ll turn it around.”

Despite out-shooting the Golden Flash-
es 3-o in the first overtime, the Panthers
were unable to score.

In the second overtime, the roles re-
versed with Kent State unable to take ad-

’ vantage of out-shooting Pitt 3-0.

The Panthers out—shot Kent State 12-8

 overall, but the Golden Flashes had four

shots on goal to Pitt’s three. -
Cuba and Carroll ledthe Panthers with
