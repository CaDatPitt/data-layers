Association (RSA) Board voted
‘ Monday.
The Board rejected an Office of
Residence Life suggestion to move
the pinball machines into the inner

“It was suggested by the Office
of Student Affairs that we move
one pinball machine into each
Tower to cut down on outside use of
the machines,” Assistant to the
Director of Residence Life Tim
Snyder said. -

The RSA Board said vandalism
and noise problems would make
the movement of the pinball

_ machines ineffective in solving the

problem.

“The pinball machines are
currently supervised by the desk
attendant ‘and the campus police-
man. How would we be able to
prevent vandalism if the machines
were moved?” RSA Chairman
Marty Doerﬂer asked.

Doerﬂer also said moving the
pinball machines would not prevent
transients from using-the machines
during the day.

“If Student Affairs feels that
transients using the machines is
the problem, then moving the
machines into the inner core will
not solve the problem at all,”
Doerﬂer said. .

“The RSA" does not think
transients are the biggest» users of
the machines, and we do not even
see any reason.to move the pinball

From Athletic Department S

Hockey Club Granted $1,000

BY STEVE SYBERT

The Pitt "Hockey Club has
received a considerable boost from
the Athletic Department in the
form of a $1,000 grant to Student
Government earmarked for Hockey
Club activities.

The grant was announced in a
meeting last Thursday with Ath-_
letic Director Casimir Myslinski,

' Student Government Board mem-

ber Craig Bluestein and Hockey-
Club Board members Bob Arturo
and Harriet Kruman.

According to Bluestein, Myslin-
ski (who was not available for
comment) said at the meeting there
are long-range plans to increase
the quality of hockey at Pitt and to
build a rink.

“The hockey program will soon
be a full-scale varsity program as it
is on many campuses,” Bluestein
said. “He (Myslinski) doesn't think
there could be a good varsity
program here without, a rink, which
could be put to double use as
a recreational facility.” '

There has been much controver-
sy in recent years over who should
manage the Ho_ckey Club’s activi-
ties——the Athletic Department or

group has been funded only by
Student Government.

/

 ' Student Government." Until now the '

, sen Member Craig Bluestein

. Myslinski has maintained the
reason he will not fund the club is
not because of lack of money in the
Athletic Department, but because
there are no campus facilities for

— -the sport. - ~

. However, the $1,000 grant is
expected to be a step forward to

eventual full funding and a varsity 
hockey program, according to the.

Hockey Club.

“He (Myslinski) was very’

positive towards hockey,” Arturo

said. “He wants to see hockey -. 
grow, but he wants to see a rink on T 

campus beforegoing varsity.” .

“The hockey club is really a team’ — .
and plays a rigorousschedule just  
like other varsity sports, though it V _’
is backed by Student Government, - ;.
“It I has a larger *

budget than other athletic clubs.”.‘

The grant is being awarded on .a  f'_
technicality because Myslinski 
does not want the situation to. get 7 ‘
out of hand and have all athletic 
clubs coming to him for support, _j__'-..-

Bluestein said.

“Myslinski is giving the $1,000;

According to Arturo, the Hockey

Club is running on an $18,000."

  FAS Counci|Ta|ks Tenure

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

A change in tenure-election
policy in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) was the subject of
yesterday's FAS Council meeting,
centering on the “Schulman
Resolution,” which calls for more
faculty power in tenure decisions.

The Schulman Resolution would
enact a two-level process of
evaluation beyond simple depart-
mental approval of a potential
tenure candidate.

With the current practice of
centering tenure decisions with
FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg, the
two-level review would add a panel
of experts appointed by the dean

and a second body of faculty from
FAS at large.

The second body would, be a
Standing Committee on Tenure,
appointed by a larger panel, the
Appointments, Tenure and Promo-
tion Council, which would be
comprised of faculty elected at the
department level.

FAS Council is considering the
resolution as a result of a full
faculty meeting earlier this term at
which a tenure-policy proposal
from the FAS Council was replaced
by the Schulman Resolutionc

Since the October meeting, Irwin
Schulman, an associate professor
in the political science department,
has rewritten the resolution twice,

incorporating concepts from other if ‘

sources. -

Livewire: ‘Substitute’ Dorm Students Upset

.Hughes felt a possible reason that manylof the i
Carlow-assigned students are freshmen is that their

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

How would you feel if, after applying for dormitory
housing on campus and paying your deposit, you were
informed that you would be living in the Webster Hall
Hotel or Carlow College dorms? Some of the 140 students
“substitute dorms” because of
insufficient housing feel very dissatisﬁed with the
situation. ‘ -

Several of the students in the Carlow dorms, many of
them freshmen, feel it is hard to adjust to college life when
isolated from Pitt. They contend upperclassmen should be
assigned to Carlow since they already are acquainted with
Pitt.

These students also feel that since Carlow is quite a
‘distance from Pitt, they miss out on many of the night
activities.

The phone situation at the Carlow dorm also is a problem
for a few of the students. There is one hall phone, which
services an entire ﬂoor. At the Pitt dorms, each room has
its own phone.

A major gripe about the Webster Hall Hotel is theillack of '

security for students living there. People are free to come
-and go ‘without an escort, according to the students.

. “Since Web s~ter-Hall Hotelis’a_icom_m_ercial. operation-,p, not »_ ._

a University dorm, we cannot enforce a security-escort
policy,” Housing Director Don Hughes said.

We approached the Office of Resident Life about the
possibility of the.University employing a guard for security
at Webster Hall Hotel for the students. “Webster Hall
Hotel has their own security system,” Assistant Director of
Residence Life Tim Snyder said. ‘‘If it’s evident that there

_is a need for further security in Webster Hall, we would

definitely act on it.” «

A majority of the students complaining agreed it is an
inconvenience to eat in the Towers cafeteria, but they have
no other choice.

“We never make it to breakfast in the Towers since we

live such a distance away,” one Webster Hall Hotel
resident said. “But we still pay for it.”

Hughes said he sympathizes with the students. He said I

the problems of inadequate housing arose because of a
substantial increase in students returning to on-campus
housing.

“Our target ﬁgure for returning upperclassmen was
approximately 2,000,” Hughes said. “The actual number,
however, was 2,300, which left us with 300 extra
upperclassmen to house.” *

.“The problem was further complicated when the yield of .

freshmen admitted with housing was 1,300 and

applications reached the Housing Office after the

other
spaces had been ﬁlled. ‘ V

“A set of priorities, a complicated bidding session and

an advanced payment usually determine who get what
room,” Hughes said. “The set of priorities has been in
existence for many years in that upperclassmen get ﬁrst
shot, then freshmen admitted with housing next, regional.
relocates (from branch campuses), transfers, and then
commuters if there’s room left over.”

A committee comprised of students, faculty and the

Residence Student Association reviewed the priority list ‘i

and presented suggestions for change to Vice Chancellor of
Business and Finance Joseph Dutton, according to
Hughes. A

Concerning students in Webster Hall Hotel and Carlow, A '

dorms, Hughes said as soon as vacancies occur, the
students will be brought to Pitt..

,“Between terms, due to legal withdrawals, vacancies  
.will occur,” Hughes said. “One of the legal withdrawals,“

for example, is graduation.” ,_ .
Hughes said he would recommend the students living at
Carlow and~Webster Hall Hotel to be given the priority of .

In September, Vice Chancellor

for Student Affairs Alfred Moye
said the pinball machines should be
removed from the Towers lobby.
-Moye said he felt the pinball
machines attracted non-University

In other action, the RSA Board
"voted to sanction the existing
Office of Residence Life Security
Committee with the provision that
decisions made by the committee
would have to be approved by the
RSA Board.

According to Assistant Director
of Residence Life, .10 Ann Woodson
Gibbs, the Security Committee was
set up under the Office of
Residence Life as a committee with
student input.

“The committee discusses secur-
ity problems, tries to solve
problems unique to the particular
dorms, and recommends policies,”
Gibbs said.

“We just want to make sure the
committee does not approve a
policy or a recommendation with-
out our approval,” Doerﬂer said.

FAS Council
Talks Tenure

(Continued from Page I)

“This resolution had its origins
in FAS. The faculty are looking for
a mechanism for getting faculty
into the tenure-decision process,”
Schulman said.

Schulman noted that a similar
multi-level review system was in
effect at Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity, and that a standing committee
of faculty was involved in tenure at
Columbia University. 3 3

“We have a Tenure Proimiotionsi

and Review Board for faculty who
think they’ve been screwed, and

the Tenure and Academic Proce-
dures Committee of the Faculty
Senate, not to speak of the court
system.

“This proposal doesn’t seek to
destroy either of these options,
although if it's implemented they
may not be necessary,” Schulman
said.

One of the functions of the
Appointments, Tenure and Promo-
tion Council as created by the
Schulman Resolution will be the
development of long-term and
short-term views of the needs of
departments in the faculty area.

“(The Council) shall advise the
dean of FAS on speciﬁc criteria for
appointment or promotion in FAS;
it shall develop plans, in conjunc-
tion with . the dean, showing
projected short-term and long-term
needs for tenured and non-tenured

economic climate. Yet there are millions of people exerting an in-

the resolution reads.

Although the resolution indicates '

tee on Tenure, as an organ of the

  PAYFOR
  WHAT  

tr  -:2

I-IE city of New York awoke
from a disastrous dream last
spring. For decades it had
lived I beyond its means.

I Many of its citizens had come to

believe they could get something
without paying for it—“free” col-

lege educations; huge welfare bene-

ﬁts; wage increases for city employes
double and triple those in the federal
government; extravagant, ﬁscally
unrealistic pensions.

Result: The city found itself $750
million short of meeting its current
operating expenses, and was forced
to pay close to $2 billion, yearly on
its past debts. “No other city in the
United States has provided such a
range of free services and diver-
sions,” reported one news magazine.

The only problem was, those
“services and diversions” were not
free at all. In fact, the most elemen-
tary economic truth is: Few things

A , ‘are really free. We must always pay

the piper when the dance is over.
In our personal lives, this pay-the-

piper principle seems so logical, so

matter-of-fact, that we seldom ques-

tion it. Whether we're "offering a‘

child piano lessons, buying an air

. conditioner or choosing steak over

hamburger, we weigh the beneﬁts
to be derived, and we expect to pay
the price.

But somehow we seem to aban-
don this logic when we venture upon
“social goals”—from poverty pro-
grams to health care to aid to educa-
tion. The two most common signs

of public departure from economic .

reality are the statements, “Let the
government pay for it,” and the cur-

rently popular “Tax the big corpo-_
rations—-let them pay for it.” But
who really does pay? lLet’s examine
just one case. ' A

The Union Carbide plant at Al-
loy, W. Va., which produces ferro-
alloys for the steel and aluminum
industries, used to be known as “the
world's smokiest factory.” It poured
out 91,900 tons of particles at year,
more than that emitted by all of
New York City. In 1971, Union Car-
bide began to take steps to meet a
clean—up schedule developed with
state environmental 0fﬁcials—and
today the air is clear over Alloy.
Thanks to a vast complex of envi-
ronmental equipment that requires
almost as much room as the plant
itself, emissions have been reduced
by 97 percent.

What has the Alloy clean-up cost?
Union Carbide spent $33 million for
the elaborate anti—pollution devices.
Operation and maintenance of the
system cost more than $3 million a
year. As a result, plant operating
costs have risen more than to per-
cent. Who will pay this cost? The
company initially, certainly. But

ultimately the clean—up has to be_

reflected in the prices of alloys for
high-strength and specialty pur-
poses, and for aluminum products.
Eventually, all of us, in buying
goods made from steel and alumi-
num, will feel the economic impact.

Most would agree that the clean
air was worth the cost. Yet in set-
ting each new social goal, we, as
the people who ultimately pay,
must ask ourselves: Are the bene-
ﬁts worth the costs?

Such decisions are easily resolved
at the personal level. (Is the extra
room on the new house, the tape-
deck for your car, worth the extra
dollar outlay ,to you?) But when

3 it comes to social goals, we_may

not be fully aware of the facts, main-
ly because the decision—making. is
in ‘the hands of our surrogates-
Congressmen and regulatory—agency
officials.

Whether the decisions they make
for us are wise or unwise is ultimate-

ly decided by the voters-—-although “

it may take a long time. But wheth-
er these decisions will cost us money
has already been immutably decided
by economic reality. Americans, for
instance, ‘have spent an estimated
$2.4 billion ‘extra "on their automo-
biles since‘ 1972 to accommodate
various government—mandated com-
binations of wires, lights and buz-
zers to force them to buckle their seat

‘belts. Ordered “on behalf of” the

public, these devices proved to be
overwhelmingly unpopular, and the
law requiring them was ﬁnally re-
scinded by Congress as a “social
goal” not worth the cost.

As you read this, other bills for
social goals—many of which we
may ﬁnd admirable—are being tot-
ted up. We will pay for what we get,
so we must be sure that as a nation
we want, need and can afford them.

In the steel industry, for example,
we must be prepared for the possi-
bility that new, stilfer government
anti-pollution standards will cause
steel-industry costs to increase by $25
to $30 a ton over the next eight
years. Other costs—energy, raw ma-
terials and labor—will also drive
prices up. The companies will bear
the brunt initially, but we consum-
ers will ﬁnally pay. (Steel men don’t
print their own money; they make it
by selling their products.) Part of the
increased cost of a new car or refrig-
erator will go toward clearing the air
over Chicago, Baltimore, Pittsburgh
or Birmingham—wherever steel is
made.

Or consider, for instance, the ef-
fect of a proposed federal regulation
to require tire manufacturers to
mold coded -information regarding
traction qualities, tread resistance,
and resistance to generation of heat
into the side of each new tire. Some

@004/O

companies estimate that this regula-
tion will__add at least 75 cents to the

retail cost of each tire. In other,

words, according to the manufactur-
ers, if youbuy four tires, you will pay
$3 for both symbols you can’t under-
stand and additional testing that will

add nothing to the safety already_

required by previous regulations.
Presumably, astute consumers will

bone up on traction, wear and heat-

generation information before they

bu their tires. ~We must ask our-
y 0 O

selves: Is this regulation really worth

the cost? " - , ' -

3 Another example: flammability
standards for upholstered furniture
suggested by the Consumer Product
Safety Commission. The regula-
tions, aimed principally at cigarette-
caused ﬁres, are expected to increase
prices of upholstered sofas and arm-
chairs ‘by up to 25 "percent. The
furniture industry fears that the
standards could eliminate about 70
percent of fabrics now made for up-
holstery. If we, through our surro-
gates, decide that it is correct for the
government to impose such flam-
mability standards, then we must be
prepared to pay the _cost the next
time we buy a couch. And we may
not like the feel or look of the new-
er, nonflammable fabrics.

What all this means is that we, as
part of a complex and interrelated
economy, cannot merely wish for or
advocate some beneﬁt for a “remote”
part of our society. We must also be
prepared to accept a part of the
ﬁnancial burden. Are we prepared
to pay higher electric bills when 'we
ask a utility in our area to prov-ide
more generating capacity with less
harm to our environment? Are we
committed to reducing auto emis-
sions and increasing auto safety to
the extent that it may add as much
as $1000 to the price of our cars?

Only when we realize our funda-
mental ﬁnancial role in the laws
passed and regulations promulgated
by our public officials, will we be
sure to set wise and realistic goals.

OSWALD PLOT KNOWN

WASHINGTON (AP)—-A for-

apparently was aware that Lee
Harvey Oswald left a threatening
note at the agency’s Dallas office
shortly before President John F.
Kennedy was assassinated, a
deputy associate FBI director said
Tuesday.

The note has been destroyed and
the official, James B. Adams, said
FBI employes presented conﬂict-
ing information about the note’s
contents and its destruction.

The note’s existence was not
revealed until last July.

Adams said former assistant FBI
Director William C. Sullivan
reported learning of the note at the
time of the assassination investiga-
tion from the agent who ' was
directing the FBI office in Dallas.

’ But that agent, now retired, has
denied any knowledge of the note,
its destruction, or a visit by Oswald

Free LSAT
Preparation
Class Slated

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

Students planning to take the
December .6 Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) can sign up for free
preparation workshops sponsored
by the University Learning Skills
Center.

The preparation classes include
an initial diagnostic test that is
graded and analyzed for strengths
and weaknesses. Additional prac-
tice is provided in troublesome
areas.

General hints on how to take an
objective test and how to relax
during the test also are included in
the workshop.

“Of course we can’t guarantee
higher scores on the LSAT" after
taking our preparation sessions,”
Learning Skills Center Coordinator
Dr._Susan Schiller explained. “All
we can really do is help the
students know what to. expect and
familiarize themselves with the test
sections and instructions. But .I
think a lot of PCOPIC can raise their
scores -through practice hereor on
their own,” Schiller said.

The Learning Skills Center may
be more effective than individual
preparation since actual test
conditions are simulated for the
practice test.

“We also provide a place and a
time to study as well as an outside
motivating force,” Schiller said."
“People are more likely to study if
they have an appointment to do

’Students are encouraged to
attend class sessions and are

Answers tothe Review

The state-level report issued yesterday on University operations no
doubt will meet mixed reactions around campus.

Governor Shapp’s management-review team began its inquiry last
May in hopes of discovering ways in which state-flmded institutions
would be able to cut down on operational costs.

5 Judging only by the recommendations released Sunday by a
Harrisburg source, the ﬁnal report is far-reaching and has the potential

I to affect every segment of "the University commrmity.

Though, of course, they’re only suggestions, there’s no reason to

‘believe each point won’t be considered seriously.
Among the recormnendations are the merger of Pitt’s Titusville

campus with Clarion State College’s Venango campus,

the

establishment of a University consulting service  which faculty
would do work for the industrial sector, and for students, the institution '
of electronic equipment for stricter security and a $50-per-resident

assessment fee for vandalism.

.  These. suggestions will give students, faculty and administrators a

lot to think about.

Naturally, the decision to implement parts of the review will be left

to the administration.

Wethinkitonlyfairthattheadministratorsairtheir views onthe
points in the report to the entire University comnnmity. -
Especially in light of this year’s tuition hike and the simultaneous
claims by the administration tohave done everything possible to avert
it, we’d like to know what Pitt ofﬁcials think of these cost-cutting

measures.

Letter

I would like to raise several

.. points in response to the recent

letters of Edmund Lahage and
Michael Salito in support of the UN
and" international upheaval.

. Firstly, Lahage alleged the UN

“has achieved much in peacekeep-
ing.” When he wrote that I don’t
think he had in mind Southeast
Asia, Cyprus, India, Pakistan or
the Middle East.

Lahage then goes on to sum up
the current turmoil in the UN as
being a result of the “developing
new nations...demanding a greater
say in the utilization of their own
resources.” Utilization of resour-
ces is a euphemism for the Arab
countries quadrupling of oil prices,
using the precious commodity as a
political weapon and trying to

‘wreak economic havoc on the
; Western industrialized nations. He
then goes on to state “no, issue

could elicit more emotional back-
lash in the'United States than the
threat that other nations may not
share the uncritical romance the
United States has with the state of
Israel.” . V
First of all, there is no such

- threat; it is a fact. There are many

nations in the world that are greatly
upset about America’s friendship
with Israel and are very critical of
it. But to claim that whether other

A governments may agree‘ with US

foreign policy or not is such an
emotional issue with the American
The
way Lahage describes the intensity

_. of the American commitment to
, Israel, one would expect masses of
« people to riot in the streets if_
anything were ever done to upset:
As for the

that relationship.
US-Israeli “romance,” allow me to

., _. » ‘cite some examples of the romantic
" and passion-driven excesses that

America has committed for Israel.
' In 1956, after Nasser committed

. an internationally recognized act of
. war by closing the Gulf of Aqaba to

Israeli cargo ships, Israel respond-

-~ - edj by invading the Sinai and
’ reopening the Gulf.
 - V States, in conjunction with Egypt's

The United

ally, the’ Soviety Union, forced
Israel. to withdraw her forces from

consolation the UN peacekeeping

would never be closed again. Then
in 1973 Israel was attacked on the

. solemnest day of the Jewish year.

And I -after Israel managed- to
outmaneuver and capture the

' Egyptian Third Army, the United.

States threatened to stop all
military“ and economic support to

Israel "unless she gave up her-

bargaining advantage in the peace

do not sufﬁce, how about the most I

recent incident where, after Israel

Jamal

Replies on Mideast

refused to give up strategic passes
and oil fields without a declaration
of nonbelligerency from Egypt, the
United States entered into a
reassessment (read: behind the
scenes arm-twisting and blackmail-
ing) of its relationship with Israel?
In his letter on the subject, Salito
writes that the government, of
Israel has “cried that Arab
terrorism is the reason for
expansion and that the Arab
governments, from the beginning,
have tried to extinguish Israel.”
In the ﬁrst place, Israel has never
claimed to be holding any
territories because of Arab terror-
ism. In fact, the PLO and other
would-be terrorists count for very
little in the present Mideast
scenario. The PLO is an
organization of international out.
laws. It has no regular armed
forces, and as such presents no real
threat to the existence of Israel as a
state. What Salito might be
referring to is Israel’s refusal to
return the Golan Heights, because
_all Syria ever did when it had the
Golan was to shell Israeli farm
settlements near the border.
Concerning the concerted and
well-planned invasions of Israel by
seven .Arab - armies, this is a
well-established, historic fact. If
Salito doubts this, I refer him to a
statement by Azzam Pasha, secre-

tary general of the Arab League, on

May 14, 1948, wherein he
announced the Arabs’ intention to
conduct “a war of extermination
and a momentous massacre which
will be spoken of like the
Mongolian massacres and the
Crusades.” If that does not
convince him, I would then remind
him of the _declaration made by
Husseini, head of the
Palestine Arab Higher Committee,
to the UN Security Council on April
23, 1949: “We have never
concealed the factthat we began
the ﬁghting.”

Lastly, I would like to discuss one
more statement made by Salito in
his description of the conﬂict of the
Middle East. “The Mideast crisis
today as yesterday is centered
around oil and who controls it.”
Assuming this oversimplification to
be true, does that mean to imply
that he supports the Arab countries
in their dispute with Israel just
because they own and control the
supply of oil? Does he mean that
the United States should give in to
Arab blackmail and abandon Israel
so that the Arabs will lower the
price of oil? This is a contradiction
and a betrayal of the socialist,
idealistic and humanistic causes
that Salito was attempting to
espouse in his letter.

  A View Worth Considering

BY MONICA KIMICATA

How do we begin to deal with the
cancer of violence in America that
grows more horrifying every day?
The two recent attempts to
assassinate President Ford have

forced us to face this unpleasant '

aspect of American life again. _Is
anyone really safe on the streets?
Newsweek has stated “...there
are now at least 135 million
ﬁrearms in the hands of private
citizens...and of at least 11,000
Americans who will die this year in
homicides,‘ 53% will be shot.” The
same article mocks the National
Riﬂe Association (NRA) stand that
“criminals, not guns, are the real
problem” and puts the blame for
no or ineffectual gun-control
legislation totally on the NRA’s
well-organized lobbying tactics.
But if a 1975 Gallup poll reports

that 67% of the American people —
‘want gun control and President

Ford wants gun control, how is it

-possible that the NRA can be so

powerful and manipulative in
stopping or watering down every
effective gun control bill that goes,
before,Congress? Is it possible the
hesitation to enact strict laws has to
do with the fact that what the NRA
is arguing for isn’t as banal as the
“guns for everyone” clause the
media and other sources would
have us believe? Maybe this is why
congressmen cannot ignore totally
the NRA point of view and why
they hesitate to pass strict and
blanket gun-control laws. And
maybe a brief listing of the
functions and services of the NRA
can help us understand the NRA.

Its credo reads: “The NRA, the
foremost guardian of the traditional

-American right to keep and bear

arms, believes that every law-abid-
ing citizen is entitled to the
ownership and legal use of
ﬁrearms and that every reputable
gun owner should be an active
member of the NRA.” ' There are
ﬁve items in this credo elaborated
upon in the National Rifleman (an
NRA publication) that are some-
what in agreement with gun control
advocates’ ideas.

1) That owning a firearm is
constitutional.

2) That only citizens without

criminal records should be allowed -

BY CAL RITCHEY

It seemed to be all but over
last Friday. As early as 8 am, New
York City’s financial moguls,
including Mayor Abraham Beame,
had said publicly there appeared to
be no hope for the city, which faced
default on $453 million in debts.

In Washington, Gerald Ford was

adamantly against any assistance’
New

for the beleaguered city.
York teachers’ union, the city’s
last hope, Thursday night had
refused’ to buy $150 million in city
bonds, a purchase that would
have allowed New York to meet
payments on the $453 million. and
thus keep aﬂoat, albeit at asharp
list, for another few weeks.

And then Friday afternoon, as
the clocks ticked inexorably toward
the close of banking ho_urs—ex-
tended in desperation until 4
pm——Albert Shanker’s teachers’
union reconsidered the -bond

purchase ‘and OK’d the “loan” of.

$150 million from the union
pension fund. New York was saved
temporarily.

Thus it was that Beame
engineered the ﬁrst. step of what
may prove to be a more signiﬁcant
social revolution than the October

Revolution in Russia in 1917—at .

least for New York City.

For decades it has been the
unions—the teachers, the sanita-
tion workers, the teamsters, the



 //"/' /1////.6; —— -

period before a citizen can receive a
handgun so a gun dealer has time
to check the citizen’s background
for any criminal offenses. If the
citizen has a record, he would not
be permitted to purchase a gun.

The NRA opposes firearm
registration and gun-owner licen-
sing because it feels. that only
law-abiding citizens would register
their guns. So how can registration
be an effective crime-prevention
method? It also states if the
government decides to conﬁscate
registered ﬁrearms, it will leave a
‘great majority of citizens unable to

protect themselves against attack. 

Other articles in Field and
Stream center around the fact most
people don’t know. about guns and
are misled by “Violent Crimes
Attributed to Firearms” statistics.
The much-publicized term “Satur—
day-Night Special” doesn’t‘ really
mean much. There are so many
cheap and poorly constructed
handguns on the market that it
would be virtually impossible to
classify them. And even advocates
of gun control admit the problems

. of policing the US gun market are

incredible.

For years, those against strict
control have promised complete

additional penalties on the use of a
gun in any crime. But they
complain anti-gun leaders won’t

to own ﬁrearms.
3) That every citizen who owns a

_ﬁrearm should be trained in its

operation, safety and storage.

4) That every citizen who owns a
ﬁrearm should be aware of and
comply with the legal obligations
that accompany ownership.

5) That the NRA is selling its
services. (Membership is $10 a
year).

According to articles in the
National Rifleman, the NRA favors
mandatory penalties for.those who
use ﬁrearms in violent crimes. It
favors a 15- to 30-day waiting

Just wait’ll next year

Abe Beame’s Coup de Grace 

railroad brotherhoods—that have
called the tune to which New York
and other cities danced. While the
unions have their» place’ in
maintaining equality within the
economic network, too much power
had been conceded to some of
those unions. '

But Beame may have changed-all
that. For the ﬁrst time, perhaps,
he has tied" irrevocably a major city

union to an unholy alliance with the

city administration.‘

Until‘ ‘Friday afternoon, the
teachers union risked only the jobs
of active teachers in the city—if
New York had defaulted. And
while default might have occured,

,'it is almost certain Ford would have

provided. some kind of aid on the
following Monday, if not sooner.

Now the teachers’ union has
$150 million, in addition to those
jobs, tied up in the fate of the city.

Later this year, when other debts
fall due, the teachers’ union will
have little choice but to side with
Beame. There are two possible
scenarios. One is that, if no further
money is forthcoming for the city,
the federal government ﬁnally" will
beforced to step in.

The other scenario is that, if no
federal help is forthcoming, the city
will have to redouble its’ efforts to
ﬁndquick ‘c1ash—an_d that means

, private investors. At this point, the

It is obvious there is too large
and twisted a gap between
anti-gun-control people and gun-

’ _ control advocates to iron out here.

But in order to get» any type of fair
and efficient gun-control, legisla-
tion, both groups must begin
working together with respect for
each other’s position. The NRA
seems to have been grossly miscast
in the role of an organization that

likes to see people and wildlife 

senselessly slaughtered for the
thrill of it.

The NRA’s side of the gun-con-
trol issue in the United States is a
valid one. The NRA’s skill,
knowledge and political. views on
the issue of gun control must be
used and’ considered seriously in
attempts ‘to .-enact gun-control
legislation.

city unions seem to be the most
likely source of that cash.

In either event, the teachers’
union will have an incentive to back
Beame, if only to try to prevent the
loss of the $150 million already
“lent” to the city. While it is not _
likely that the teachers’ -union will
risk any more money, Shanker, and
his board of trustees probably will
provide a vigorous lobby in behalf
of the city, particularly if Beame
goes to other "unions for ‘financial
help.

As difﬁcult as it might be, the
teachers’ union may have to
swallow its pride and p approve
stringent recovery measures for the

include massive layoffs” of ‘city
workers, including teachers. In the
past, such a move would have been
anethema to any union—but now,
Beame has the teachers’ union
between a, rock and a hardplace.

Regardless of‘ the ‘eventual
outcome of the New.York crisis, it
seems as though Beame has
rendered the coup de grace to the
traditional power and autonomy of
at least one of New York’s ruling
unions. The second act of Beame’s
revolution will be played out in the

next few months. By next" July, 

when the New York ﬁscal year
ends, the city unions maybe under’

~,-6; More Questions

Forthe Band

The selection of a Duquesne
University student to the _ Pitt
Marching Band Majorette Corps
two weeks ago has sparked
criticism among concerned stu-
dents who are neither former
Pantherettes nor sour grapes from
tryouts. The article from the
Monday, September 29, Pitt News
entitled “Majorette Selection Ig-
nites Criticism” -still leaves many
questions unanswered. As the
student body has realized this

_..,,football season especially, unless
f -‘students -show their concern

through criticism, they will be
denied the correct facts.
According to the Band Director
Donald E. Hower, “It’s quite legal
to cross-register for the band. One
earns credits for being in the Pitt
Marching Band and Duquesne
students pay tuition for it.” Please
notice the plural form of the word
credit in Hower’s quote. In
reference to the Time Schedule of
‘ Classes for the Fall 1975-76 term,
Marching Band earns one credit
per term. Therefore, the Duquesne
University student, Jacqueline
Scott, is cross-registered for only
one credit at Pitt. In essence,

'73-£;‘;lacltie or someone is paying $78

per one credit so that she can be a
member of Pitt’s Marching Band.

Was musical ability apparent, or
was the sole purpose of the
cross-registration enabling her to
be a Pitt majorette? Of course it’s
pure coincidence that Jackie is an
assistant to Larry Cervi, the
choreographer of the majorettes,
and also in the past she -was a
majorette in the Churchill Charg-
ers, who were under the direction
of Cervi. Could this be another

_ political upheaval at our univer-

qualified students chosen as
judges?

Does it seem fair that our
students should have to compete
with a student from another
university, who is a friend and an
assistant to the choreographer?
How can Cervi actually think that
we are that ignorant and naive to
believe that he had nothing to hide
and that the girls all had an equal
chance ‘to compete? It sounds
possible that the decision could
have been partially influenced
before the Pitt girls ever showed up
for tryouts for the vacant position.

If Cervi and Hower want the best
on the ﬁeld, then why’ didn’t they
look very impressive at—vIast
Saturday’s game? Haven’t they
had enough time to learn the
prc-game show? Where were they
throughout the first half of the
game? If they are supposed to be
Golden Girls, then why are they
referred to as the “Panther
Kittens” in the football program?
Are they supposed to be able to
twirl or do they just dance? If their
purpose is primarily dancing, then
why isn’t the football ﬁeld big
enough for a feature twirler? This
couldbe the spark that our band is
seeking.

I think the student body was
expecting to see quite an improve-
ment with the addition of the
Golden Girls to the band, but

  Letters to the Editor

unfortunately we are still waiting!
Our band and entire body of
students should be able to be proud
display poise, talent, enthusiasm
and self-pride of representing one
of the greatest universities. The
university that I’m referring to isn’t
Duquesne, but it is the University
of Pittsburgh!

Name withheld upon request

A University
In Pursuit of . . .

I was glad to see the article about
the University’s legal cases in the
October 13 issue of the Pitt News,
and I was not at all surprised to see
the nature of the comments uttered
by the Vice Chancellor for Business
and Finance, especially his refer-
ence to “girls and blacks.”

He is of course quite right to
assume that the public might
“misinterpret” if it became aware
of the amount of money that is

~ being allocated for the purpose of ‘

defending the indefensible, namely
that the University does not
discriminate against minorities and
women. If the public knew of. the
-institutional might and dollars that
are being brought to bear against
individuals and groups who have
been victims of discrimination, it
would certainly raise questions as
to where its tuition and tax dollar_s

O are going. * - .

Wednesda‘Y{U,ct0ber‘,‘22.   

At least two concerns come to
mind: ﬁrst, if the University is in
fact paying insurance for profes-
sors to protect them from charges
of racism and sexism, who is

paying compensation to all those .

victims of past and present racism
and sexism in this institution,'for
the potential that has been snuffed
out and for the indignities and
humiliation that they have suffered
from the overt and subtle discrimi-
natory practices that occur over, and
over?

Second, I do not recall being
made aware of the fact that the
University was actively recruiting
for two attorneys in the newly
formed Legal Services department.

I can only assume that this was just
one more act of administrative flat
and that the University is satisﬁed
with the results.

It is incomprehensible and
indefensible that an institution that
makes claims to “excellence” and
“pushing back the frontiers of
knowledge” puts so much of its
resources into a “front-line defense
against lawsuits” rather than
addressing the causes and effects
of discrimination.

lrnage of Band

Concerning your October 13
editorial about Tiger Paul Aus-
1ander’s forced removal from
basketball. games, I heartily agree
with the content but I think the
comments about the. Pitt Band and
the Golden Girls were unwarrant-
ed, untrue, and representative of
the unfair image of the band
presented in the Pitt.News. In the
editorial, the band was character-
ized as “some John Phillip Sousa
and a row of lifted thighs.”

This is simply an inaccurate)

image. This year the band has
presented an entirely new look with
brassy, exciting arrangements -of
today’s popular music, a fast-mov-
mg marching format, a set of
excellent, well-trained majorettes,
and, most important, '
crowd response not heard for many
years in Pitt Stadium for any band.

Yet, the only things one reads in
the Pitt News are that an
anonymous ex~Pantherette was

upset that a Duquesne student was V

made a majorette and that an
anonymous band member said that
band was rife with dissension. Now

. your editorial implies the band is

archaic.
Though I fully agree that Tiger
Paul’s expulsion is ludicrous, the

band hardly deserves the “archa-

ic” rap. , -

_ liberal arts, ’ ’

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

It seems paradoxical that there

should be doubts about the quality
of education at an institution of

_- higher education. Quality, not in

the sense of whether courses are
good or bad, but in the institution’s
response to students’ needs. And
that problem is compounded when
it becomes one of confusion over
what a liberal arts education is and
how it can benefit the individual.
This confusion is no doubt
expressed by many students in the
College of Arts and Sciences
_ (CAS). What good is a liberal arts
degree?
Dr. Jack Daniel, CA_S associate
,dean, admitted he does not have all
’the answers but said he may have

. ‘the proper analysis of the question.
1 6 6 t

ink the current economic
‘-situation is causing an exaggerated
emphasis on careers as opposed to
Daniel said. “I
seriously question the quality of

..education our students can be

receiving, given the fact there have
not been systematic instutional
' responses to the needs of these

students . ’ " .
Daniel’s interest in the problems

' of a university education grew out

of his concern with the creation of
the black’ studies department at
Pitt. As department chairman from
1969 to 1973, Daniel studied the
needs and problems of a black
education. His scope, however,
quickly shifted beyond the prob-
lems of only black students.
“The more I studied the
educational needs of black students
and the more I tried to define black

over the writing skills of white
students.” .

The origin of the problem seems
to be when Pitt became state-rela-

ted. Up until that time (1966), Pitt‘

had spend a decade trying to
become a ﬁrst-rate, private re-
search university. When Pitt
became state-related, the makeup
of the student body drastically
changed. .

Sixty per cent of Pitt’s students
come from families whose parents
never went to college. Sixty per
cent are from Allegheny County
and 90% are from Pennsylvania.
Further, the faculty has had a
difficult time adjusting from an
emphasis on research to an
emphasis on teaching, and, Daniel
said, the University has not made
any institutionalized attempt to

force this change.

As a result, Daniel said,
“Students have not been ade-
quately informed about what a
liberal arts education is.”

Before the late sixties, this
information was transmitted by the
structure of course requirements.
Students learned about the meth-
ods and values of different
disciplines because they were
required to take English writing, a
language, and sciences. E

“In the sixties we got rid of a lot
of requirements. But in the
absence of rules and regulations,
many students do not know how to
get a liberal arts education. They
have no clear guidelines to follow.”

Daniel does not believe these
requirements should be re-institu-
ted. Rather, he said the freshman

year should be restructured to
expose incoming students to the
facilities and programs within the
University. First, Daniel proposed
expansion of freshman orientation
beyond the summer program into
an ongoing process to acquaint
freshmen with University facilities,
such as the library. Also, seminars
should be available to every
freshman. Finally, the students
need faculty members willing to
help with writing difficulties or to
refer them elsewhere for assist-
ance.

“Students,” Daniel said, “have
to be shown the ‘value of focusing
on skills as opposed to factual
content. They have to be shown the
value of understanding the thought
process.”

This, more than anything, is the
essence of Daniel’s philosophy
regarding the liberal arts educa-
tion. Its validity comes from the

:methods and attitudes it teaches,

not from the particular subject
matter.

Daniel’s ideas already are
beyond the contemplation stages.
Besides starting a survey to
correlate important demographic
material about Pitt students, he is
involved in teaching a‘ freshman.
seminar, along with Associate
Provost Donald Henderson and
Rachel Hudson, a student majoring
in black studies and speech,
entitled “A University Education...
Whatand Why?” This particular
course is for University Community
Educational Programs students,
but is a possible prototype for
future courses open to all fresh-
men.

Daniel realizes all his work could
be in vain. , '

“After all research is done, I'm
worried about whether anything

‘will really be done. Why? The

students we now have present the
greatest challenge ever to a faculty
member’s ability to teach.”
Perhaps Daniel is skeptical, but
this may be because he realizes the

immensity of the problem. Chang-
ing educational attitudes is possi-
bly one of the most painstaking
jobs, and the nature of the
institutional response, if it ever
comes, cannot be predicted. But
Daniel recognizes the frustrations
students have and it is at least
reassuring to know that some-
where, within the vastness of the
University, there is an office where
these frustrations are understood.

One of Best

BY SARA ELINOFF

The quality of a museumis
determined by its staff, history,
research and collection. Based on
those criteria, Carnegie Museum of
Natural History is one of the top
half-dozen in the country, accord-
ing to Director Craig Black.

However, Black said the muse-
um can be improved and said a
massive fund-raising project initia-
ted two years ago is $10 million
short of its $33-million goal.

“We plan to write a complete
exhibit story for the general public
to explain what they’re seeing. We
want to a_rrange the exhibits in
continuity and take the person
through time, geology, biology,
desert, tropical and polar areas,”
Black said.

By a rearrangement of the
exhibits, he continued, the public
may find the answers to vital
questions, such as “How did man
evolve?”

Other plans include a complete
renovation of collections, offices
and‘ labs.

“Carnegie Museum was built in
1912 and scientists today are

first scientists of the museum,”
Black said.

A reorganization of the muse-
um’s educational programs is
another primary goal of the
fund-raising project, he said.

“We want to develop an
educational program with a parti-
cular focus so people can come to
the museum and learn about a

ago?’ or ‘How has man affected the
'environment?’ ” .Black said.

“On the college level, we want
more scientists giving classes at
Pitt, C-MU, Duquesne and Chat-
ham. Unfortunately, many colleges
can’t offer all the services that
they'd like _to because they’re in a
pinch.

“Enrollments have leveled off,
causing a decrease in the budget.
Carnegie Museum has a wealth of
collections and people to offer to
students.”

Black said the importance of a
museum like this cannot be
underestimated. A natural history
serves as a national
resource for information and
specimens about the world around
us.

“We also serve as
research trainers for students. We
train historians—co1leges don’t do
that.” ‘

Each year, as Halloween ap-
proaches, little boys and girls sit in
the eerie confines of their cellars
and spook themselves with tales of
ghosts, witches and haunted
houses. ' ,

And each year, as late October
approaches, big boys and girls sit
despondently in the dim confines of
their college libraries and dorm-

rooms, wishing they could recap- '

ture the simple pleasures of a good
Halloween spine-tingler.

Deep in the black woods of the
South Hills, over winding roads
and ancient railroad tracks, lies the
fulﬁllment of many overgrown
Halloweeners’ dreams.

The Haunted House sits omi-
nously along Streets.Run Road in
Baldwin, with two giant chestnut
trees spreading their branches in
front of its entrance. The sound of
barking dogs and the mournful

chirping of crickets ﬁlters through
the air.

A Haunted House? That’s right.
The strangely menacing building
was constructed in_ 1860, and
legend has it that it was used as a
hiding place for slaves during the
Civil War.

Now, over a century later, the
South Hills Jaycees have converted
the rooms of the House into a
network of ghoulish surprises for
those who refuse to surrender their
love of Halloween adventure.

The Jaycees have been working
on the project since June, and hope
to raise over $20,000 for the
Muscular Dystrophy Society and
youth programs by the time the
Haunted House closes its doors on
November 1.

Where do the Jaycees plan to get
20,000 visitors to their house of
horror? Mainly from local colleges,
and-the younger segment of the
Pittsburgh area’s population.

“We’re expecting mostly young
people in the 19-to-30 age
bracket,” explained the chairman
of the Haunted House, Mac
McGivern. “Hopefully, college
couples will realize it’s a cheap
night out, and a fun night out.”

The ‘$1 admission, McGivern
said, is-a small price to pay for “the
best Haunted House outside of
Disney World.” Especially when
the proceeds are going to local
charities, he added.

According to members of the
Haunted House committee, the
ancient House, across from the
7-Up bottling plant on Streets Run
Road, originally was owned by Mr.

‘Dupont, corporate magnate and

founder of Dupont Industries.

It was during Dupont’s owner-
ship that the House served as a
base for the “Underground Rail-
road” in the 1860s.

The second owner lived in the
House until 1970,‘ but McGivern

,..,

noted this gentleman "‘went"'

he died five years ago.
The Haunted House is only a

Redford Spies in ‘Condor’

BY M.C. PILECKI ‘

‘It’s surprising that nobody’s

' latest spy ﬂick, Three Days of the

Condor, with the Pittsburgh pro
basketball team of the same name
and the same duration. I

Oh well, let's pass that one by.
Condor has several things going for
it: the timeliness of the questions

regarding the Central Intelligence

star Robert Redford; and the
relative shortage of spy flicks after
a fairly recent glut.

These are factors not to be

The story begins with a mass

expects much factual stuff in a
movie anyway), .there are a few
good ‘performances in the ﬁlm.
Topping the list is Max von Sydow
as the chief nasty gunning for our

  Detecting Art Frauds:
Science Made Easy

BY MREA CSAORBA

A small sculpture discovered
in Michelangelo’s shop passed _for
generations as a Maestro authen-
tic. The piece since has been

. discredited.

An unemployed Italian man
busied himself during the'Depres-
sion by carving sculptures in the
manner of Renaissance masters.
The young man later discovered
the pieces were sold as Donatello
originals at huge proﬁts.

Museum curators‘ and art dealers
long have worried over the
authenticity of artworks they" accept
and exhibit. Until recently, art
dealers were forced to rely on
personal judgment, reputable con-
tacts, and an extensive knowledge

-of art history to weed out

fraudulent works. Scientific
methods now assist the dealers’

methods and machinery used in
testing an artwork’s authenticity.
Included in the exhibition are
numerous identiﬁed fakes. Exam-
ples of some veriﬁed works by the
original masters are offered as
points of comparison.

The science of dendrochronology
is used to validate the age of
wooden sculptures, antique furni-

This process relies on informa-

Admittedly, forgers can counter
successful dating methods by using
antiquated materials. X-rays then

best known 20th-century forger,

Music Alive & Well in Pgh.

A BY PAMELA Eusr

A large crowd of symphony-
starved music lovers poured into
Carnegie Music Hall Monday night
to hear the Guarneri String
Quartet. An added attraction was
the special appearance of Michael
Grebanier, principal cellist with the
still-disputing Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Orchestra.

The ﬁrst number on the program
was the Quartet No. 39 in C Major
[The Bird], Opus 33, No. 3, written

in 1781 by the “Father” of the—
string quartet, Joseph Haydn.

Flowing melodies and'pulsing
rhythms kept this quartet together
and alive. Cello garnishes
enhanced the main themes while
rich harmonies gave the work warm
overtones. Often echoes ran from
one instrument to another, keeping

the musicians on their toes.
The piece’s nickname,

“The
came from the second
movement, in which the ﬁrst violin
warbles away like a bird while the
second violin supports it as a
“gently swaying twig.”

Some parts of the quartet
seemed nebulous in the muddied
string parts and mutterings of the
dark cello_colors. There was some
ﬁne technique shown through in
the last movement. The piece was
played at an extremely fast pace,
but hardly a note or chord was
missed and the pauses and attacks
were right on cue. .

Bela Bartok wrote his Third
String Quartet in 1927. Noted as a
very challenging piece, the Quartet

recalled Bartok’s fascination at the

time with Bach, displayed in the
intricacies of the melody, which
was taken from a Hungarian folk
song.

Considered as “music of ex-
tremes,” the Quartet handled the
complexity of rhythms, contrasts in
dynamics and, more than anything
else, kinetic nervous energy.

Dissonant chords screamed into
slides up and down the scale.
Abrupt pauses effected the conti-
nuity of themes and an eerie effect
was gained through scraping the
bow very close to the bridge of the
instruments.

Sudden pizzicato notes and
contrasting harmonies charactized
special bits of dialogue. At certain
times the slidings and sound
effects weremuch like police and
ambulance sirens.

‘ After a brief intermission, the
Quartet returned with» Grebanier

and dug into the Quintet in C,

Major, Opus 163; D. 956,. written
by Franz Schubert in 1828.
Schubert may have been inﬂuenced
_by George.Onslow and Boccherini
as models for his, own Quintet.

This work was composed only a few A‘

weeks before Schubert’s death and
waited over 20 years for its
premiere in 1850.

A part of the third movement is

regarded as Schubert’s self-.

requiem, and the second move-
ment is known as one of his most

characteristic compositions. ‘Evi-

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
   
 

dently this quintet is not to be
taken lightly! ' The Guarneri
, Quartet gave it their best effort.

With two cellos, the cello parts
naturally will come out a little
heavier than they normally would.
But this was not overemphasized,
and a delicate balance was
maintained. Fugue-like patterns
enveloped the beautiful, warm
harmonies of the combined cellos.
Precise rhythmic backgrounds sus-
tained the main themes and were
included in the occasional dramatic
builds.

Savage attacks, feather’-light
tones and gracious melodies
highlighted the remainder of the
work.

UPDIKE AT FORUM

John Updike will make his
second appearance at the Interna-
tional Poetry Forum on October 29
at 8 pm in Carnegie Lecture Hall.
His ﬁrst published work was a book
of poems The Carpentered Hen and
Other Tame Creatures.

Sharing the stage with Updike
will be Karen Swenson.

misleading surface and revealed
the telltale signs of fraud.

Similarly, x-rays discredited a
supposed Van Gogh self-portrait.
Viewed through x-ray photographs,
the application of paint and the thin
underlayering did not match the
technique of proven Van Gogh
originals. Berlin cab driver-turned-
art dealer Otto Wacker confessed
to the fraud.

A spectophotometer is used to
analyse a painting’s pigments and
its mineral content. One forgery
imitative of Raphael’s style was

(discovered through its use of cobalt

blue. The pigment cobalt ‘blue was
not discovered until the late 18th
century, by which time Raphael

had been dead for 200 years.

Pigments today are often synthe-
tic or more reﬁned than earlier
paints. An examination of the
pigment’s mineral content “date”
the painting.

Metal works are analyed by the
x-ray fluorescence method. Again
due to modern reﬁning techniques,
alloys now are much purer than the
crude metals of the past. The
surface may be artiﬁcially agetd but
mineral analysis tells the real truth.

This show puts to rest all worry
of fraudulent works being exhi.-
bited. If a few escape detection
they deserve admiration for
“crafty”-ness and skill.

The show continues through
November.

Dunaway is perhaps the film’s

manages to have one of the best
lines in the movie, but by the time
her character steps out of the
picture, her morbidity and maso-
chism have become pitiable. One
supposes that this is director Dino
cle Laurentiis’ view of women-
culpable, morosevcreatures, who
live only to serve. Dunaway tries to
put some life into the character, but
it’s so far gone that even such a
talent as Dunaway’s is to no avail.
One of the problems with Condor
is that it is almost completely

Redford’s character does try to
inject a little chutzpah, but it’s too
little too late. He’s much too all

the paranoia isn’t all that effective.
Possibly the best part of the
movie is the ending. In more ways

Hard Times is another macho

muscle-flexing ventura, this time —

set in Depression-era New Orleans.
Charles Bronson, the world’s top
movie star, is an itinerant free
thinker earning his money, for the
moment, as a street ﬁghter. His
promoter is James Coburn, an
overblown ne’er do well with
perpetual delusions of grandeur.
It's the revelation of Coburn’s
inflated ego—his car, his perform-
ance with a prostitute——that make
for the most incisive comments on
his character and some of the more
interesting moments of the film.
For his part, Bronson is the
Strong and Silent (with capital S’s)

type, the historical loner.

As the saying goes, this is a
man’s man’s picture, all sweat and
corded necks, with the characters
taking turns knocking each other
down. It's the perfect ﬂick for the
locker room.

Actually, if you’re not turned off
by a movie that concerns ﬁghting
and a lot of heavy macho, Hard
Times is really. a pretty good ﬁlm. It

has a gritty quality expected of a M g

male-oriented ﬁlm, and a univer-
sality not limited to the Depression
or simple street ﬁghting.

Naturally enough, women have
practically no part in the movie.
Bronson’s wife, Jill Ireland, has a
small, seemingly artiﬁcially cre-
ated role as a street type, but her
aristocratic features shine through
incongruously, make her very out
of place in the movie.

Daltrey Belts Out ‘Horse’

BY TOM WASELESKI

Ridea Rock Horse, Roger Daltrey.
MCA Records, MCA-2147

 

-—— .

Certainly the most accomplished
member of the Who whenever
away from the group (though Pete
Townsend freaks would like to
argue that one), Roger Daltrey has
cut one of the guttsiest records
around. : .

Ride a Rock Horse and his other
solo album, Daltrey, are like night
and day. Most critics hacked
Daltrey to death because of its
over-laden orchestration and the
obvious attempt to make the

‘ throaty vocalist turn pop softy. But

the new album should please
plenty of people, mainly Who fans
used to Daltrey belting it out.

The music on Ride a Rock Horse
has plenty of kick, due to Russ.

Ballard’s production, playing and
writing. There are hardly any
string backups at all, in sharp
contrast to Daltrey, which used
them incessantly. Ballard uses

" heavy brass and a lot of organ to do
' the fitting accompaniment to

Daltrey’s rocky pipes.
“Come and Get Your Love”
opens the record on a soulful note,

foreshadowing much of the cuts to-

come. _

A piano then leads into “Heart-s
Right” and you think for a second
this is gonna be mellow, but then
Daltrey comes on the scene’ and you
know it ain't so. The chorus is the
best part of the song, forceful yet
restrained, and the smooth backing
vocals do a great job of making
Daltrey’s voice stand out.

“Oceans Away” is as close to the
style of his ﬁrst album that Daltrey
comes. There's no getting around
the tenderness of this love ballad,
but at least here the melody is
carried -by his voice and not a
section of violins. Some strings do
provide a light backdrop to the
edge in Daltrey’s words and the
rich piano throughout makes this
one of the album’s best cuts.

Probably the harshest Daltrey’s

' voice gets-is on “Proud,” a tight,

heavy-beating song. The soul
backup does nothing to offset the
roughness, and for this reason the
tune is a little-too coarse to the ear.

“Near to Surrender” is a nice,_

mellow piece (one of Ballard’s) that
serves as a sort of oasis to the heat
of the rest of the album. .

The last cut, “I Was Born to Sing
Your Song,” is done in the same
vein. Daltrey stays low-key

throughout the whole ballad till the V

end when his gravelly voice
struggles with his mellow one for
dominance in a ﬁery exchange of
strength and quiet beauty. Both
voices fade and some strings and
woodwinds that know their place
follow to ﬁnish it all off without
making you forget about Daltrey.
driving just a second ago-

Due to the neat arrangement of . .

every part of the music, its
simplicity and ability to showcase
Daltrey without obscurin g him," this
is my personal favorite._ 1' ’

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
BY TOM HALL
Associate Sports Editor

, The weekly Pitt football luncheon
had a special guest yesterday in the
person of Athletic Director Casimir
Myslinski. It was his announce-
ment that brought the usually
lethargic crowd tolife.

“We have been selected once
again for a national television game
by ABC. It will be the Penn State
game, to be held in Three Rivers
Stadium at 4:05 on November 22,
which is the original date for the
game,” Myslinski said.

After another announcement
and the West Virginia—Pitt en-
counter" will be shown via closed
circuit television at the Stanley
Theatre, the luncheonaires got
down to the upcoming Navy game.

It soon became evident that
every game on the schedule has
become crucial. A winning season
isn’t enough. Advances must be
made. And with the Panthers
beginning to get some national
recognition (Pitt ranked 16th by
UPI, 17th by AP), the team’s win
column must continue to grow.

A victory over the Naval
Academy might be a good place to
start, _but may turn out to be easier
said than done.

“Navy has a ﬁne football team
this season, as they do every
year,” said Head Coach Johnny
Majors. ‘-‘They are presently
ranked number two in the nation in
total defense. They have excellent

  Canadiensspook Pens, 7-1

BY STEVE SYBERT

The Penguins had been cele-
brating Halloween early through
their ﬁrst four National League
(NHL) games, scaring opponents
with the league’s top per-game

goal total. But last. night, the
Montreal Canadiens were not
frightened. .

Canadien goalie Ken Dryden
donned his trick-or-treat mask and
treated the Penguins’ shooters
selﬁshly as Montreal tricked its
way to a 7-1 victory.

But the real treats were the
artistic passing and skating ﬁnesse
of the Canadiens, who always seem
to connect on their pinpoint passes
and know exactly where the puck is
at all times. The Penguins should
have_ been taking notes.

While Montreal was skating
freely up and down the ice, the
Penguins had trouble getting out of
their own zone .where they were
pinned in by the crafty Canadiens
defense.

Guy Laﬂeur and Peter Mahovlich
led the way ' for Montreal, each
scoring twice in the rout. Laﬂeur
raised his league-leading goal total
to eight, while Mahovlich notched
his sixth and seventh tallies in the ’

A opening period.

The Penguins couldn’t do any-
thing right in playing perhaps their
worst game of the year. Maho-
vlich's first goal came on a

personnel and a very organized
coaching staff. They have
presented us with problems the
past two years and this will be far
from an easy game again this
yearf’

Major’s concern is well-founded.
Of the defensive starting 11, nine
are seniors. This experience will
leave few if any weaknesses. It will
be tougher to run against senior
linebackers Chet Moeller and Andy
Bushak than to cross Fifth Avenue
during rush hour.

The Navy offense is inconsistent,
though talented. Running backs
Gerald Goodwin, Bob Jackson and

‘Mike Yeager have the size and
speed to break games wide open at
any time.

“The Navy team knows how to
execute its plays,” Majors said.
“George Welsh is an excellent,
well-organized coach, and he has a
ﬁne -staff aroundjhim. They will
prepare their team to the utmost. I
can’t say that about everyone, but I
can say that about George Welsh.”

Turning to his own‘ team, Majors
had praise for his offense and a
word of caution for the defense.

“Offensively, we are getting
better with our execution every
week. We are growing in maturity
and confidence. Our offensive line
this year may turn out to be the
best line we have had in my three
years at Pitt.

“Tony Dorsett is running better,
in my opinion, than he has ever run
since he started here. Elliott
Walker also had a very good game
last week. I think the two of them
complement each other perfectly,”
Majors said. '

The defense, the stalwarts of t-he
Pitt team so far this season, has
faltered slightly, as Majors pointed
out.

“I think maybe the defense

. lapsed a little bit last week. We

made a few individual mistakes. I

three-on-one break with Penguin
defenseman Barry Wilkins out of
position. _The second came when
the Pens couldn't grab hold of the
puck after a sixth attacker entered
the‘ game due to a delayed penalty
call. ’

Mont-real stretched its lead to 4-0
after two periods. Yvon Lambert
putin hisfirst goal of the season by
knocking in Serge Savard’s re-
bound and Steve Shutt followed
with a blistering. slap shot from the
face-off circle to the right of
Penguin goalie Gary Inness.

Jean Pronovost put the Pens on

the scoreboard with his second tally

of the year with 1:19 gone in the
ﬁnal frame, but no comeback
appeared to be in sight. The
Penguins were limited to only f ive
more shots on goal, as were the
Canadiens, who put three of them
by -Inness. .

Laﬂeur slapped in two power-
play goals and Guy Lapointe added
another, his ﬁrst of the season, to
secure, the victory for Montreal.

The Penguins were plagued by
the Canadiens’ potent power--play,
which made good four of six
opportunities, Pittsburgh, on the
other hand, did not get to display
its. Montreal received . no
penalty calls, which led to debris
being tossed at referee Dave
Newell and several stoppages in
play._.

hope they can come back a little
stronger.

“I still can’t stop talking about
Dennis Moorhead. He has been
just outstanding. He’s running all
over the ﬁeld to make tackles. He
intercepted a pass to set up a
touchdown. He’s just a helluva
ballplayer.

“Tom Perko is playing very well
at his linebacker spot. Arnie
Weatherington graded over 90%
again this week. Randy Cozens—I

wish we had redshirted last
year——is really coming around and

firs“

  

is ﬁnding out what he’s doing out“ /

theren I wish he wasn’t a senior,
but he’s been a great asset to this
team.”

Harry Jones, the backfield
coach, was asked what he does to
help Dorsett improve his running.
“After he came to spring practice
in his freshman year, and we found
out how good he really was, Coach
Majors put me in charge of making
sure‘ he was on ‘the bus on
Saturdays,” Jones said.

“Actually Tony listens very
closely to any advice I give him, but

: so much of his game is pure talent

and instinct,” Jones said, “that all
I have to do is point hirn toward the
goal lines.” » -

Hoop Schedule: Nightmare WVU Beats Pantherettes.
  Controversy Develops 6

Head Basketball Coach
TIM GRGURICH

BY JIM SPANOS

Under the direction of new

Head Coach Tim Grgurich, the Pitt
Panthers, playing on a new

" basketball ﬂoor at the Field House
and facing a new, more difficult
schedule, await the start of another
basketball season. But for now, the
top priority for Grgurich is

pxpmconditioning and improving on the
;f .». fundamentals.

,i--~

‘}

“We’ve been practicing about
three hours a night since October
15,” Grgurich said. “We’re doing
a lot of running at the present time
and we won’t be scrimmaging until
next week. We have 15 kids on the
varsity and we’re trying to push
them pretty hard.” -

Grgurich, a Pittsburgh native
who played on Pitt’s tournament
teams in 1963 and 1964, was
freshman coach at Pitt for seven
years before succeeding Buzz Ridl.
He gained much of the credit for
landing manv of the area olavers

-- The Pitt-West Virginia football

game on November 8 will be shown
live via’ closed-circuit TV at the
Stanley Theater, 207 Seventh
Street, downtown. Student tickets
will be $3.50 plus .35 city tax, and
will go on sale today in the Student
Union ticket ofﬁce.

Preceding the football game will
be a film of the last Muhammed
Ali,—.JOe Frazier fight, ‘-‘The
Thrilla in iManilla,” which will
begin at noon.

Tickets for the general public
also will be sold at the door for
$6.60. The production ,will be
sponsored by Sports Spectacular
Productions in‘ conjunction with

who enrolled at Pitt in recent years.

Having lost Melvin Bennett to
the pros and Kirk Bruce, Lew Hill,
Lucius Keese and Jim Bolla to
graduation, it appears the task
facing Pitt this year is a formidable
one. ‘A -

Bruce, the leading scorer for the
Panthers last year with 17 points
per game, was hired by Grgurich as
an assistant coach. Bruce closed
out his career as the 10th all-time
leading Pitt scorer. Bennett, who
at 6-7 averaged 10 points and 10
rebounds a game" in his freshman
year, was drafted by the Virginia
Squires in the ﬁrst round and
signed a lucrative contract during
the summer. Hill averaged eight
points per game and Bolla added
some help inside.

The nucleus with which Grgurich
has to operate includes Keith Starr,
Tom Richards and Larry Harris,
who averaged 13, 11 and 7 points
per game last year. Though
Grgurich has not directly stated it,
it is likely Starr, Richards, and
Harris will be in the starting lineup
come the ﬁrst game of the _season.

Battling for playing time and a
possible starting berth at guard will
be Bob Shrewsbury, Frank Boyd,
Scott Nedrow, Terry Knight and
freshmen Wayne Williams from
Schenley High School and Pete
Strickland from Hyattsville,
Maryland. ,

Likewise, the center and guard
positions are uncertain, with Willie
Kelly, Ralph McClelland, Mark
Disco, Scott Stephens, John Ends-
ley, Wayne Talbott and freshman
Kelvin Smith from Schenley High
School fighting it‘ out.

“We’re going to be a passing
team for 40 minutes and we’re
going to be a hard, tough team
when it comes to running up and
down the court,” Grgurich noted.
“All I’m "going to do is_ keep
improving. Ifl can win 44 games in
two years, like we’ve_done the last
football poll, with season records.

two years, I’ll be a hell of a coach.”

The schedule, too, should
provide some incentive for the
Panthers. An exhibition game
against the Yugoslavian National
team replaces the traditional

.intrasquad Blue-Gold game Nov-
ember 17.

The middle of the schedule is
ominous; it includes games against
West Virginia, George Washing-
ton, Notre Dame, Marquette,
Virginia, Temple, Rutgers, Cincin-
nati, Syracuse, West Virginia,
South Carolina and Penn State.

“This is what we want,”
Grgurich explained. “It started
four years ago, and we want to

' continue to play the best teams in

the country. I want to go out there
and play teams of this caliber.

“I believe in our basketball
players and our program,” he
continued. “We have young men
who’ve been ‘to two straight
post-season tournaments, and
that’s given them a lot of
conﬁdence. They know they can
play with and win against the best
teams in the country. I_said when I
accepted the job that our goal is to
win a national championship, so
we’ve got to play the best teams.”

BY PATTY '1 ASCARELLA

?s somehow appropriate that

1.‘- .antherettes’ win streak was.

interrupted by West Virginia
University (WVU). The Mounties’
dominance in area tennis had been
undoubted and unchallenged until
last week, when Pitt refused to
become #29 on their victims’ list.

But yesterday afternoon, the
Mounties came to .play the
Pantherettes, and they got their
revenge, dominating the singles
(which cost them the match at
Morgantown), 3-1.

' The afternoon was not just a
series of conﬂicts off the court-
these battles would do justice to a
seasoned band of maﬁoso.

Before the singles started, there‘

apparently was a misunderstand-
ing between the WVU Assistant
Athletic Director and Head Tennis
Coach Martha Thorn, because the
team arrived in Pittsburgh not
knowing of Pitt Coach Nancy
Gordon’s decision to play three
singles and two doubles. Thorn
had strenuous objections to that
setup, but eventually an under-

standing was reached and the.

players hit the courts. ,

Admittedly, the Pantherettes
were not at full strength. Anouk
Sassouni left the team last week,
and partially torn ligaments re-
duced Jan Conway to hobbling
around the sidelines.

Maria Paris, who among her
other distinctions can be listed as
the only-‘ Pantherette to finish the
seasonwithout splitting sets, won
6-2,6-‘3.

“I thought I played really well,”
Paris began, “considering I had a
temperature of 99.4 degrees. I
concentrated a lot better. IT was

psyched out the last time I played
her. I used my head, I was hitting-
my forehand better, I played net,
and my serve was really going in
today.”

Mary Sue Ramsden, playing
second doubles, lost both sets to
Sarah Palmer, 5-7,2-6.

“I don’t think they’re the best ' ‘

team we’ve played,” Palmer said.

“Second set I played my own game‘

instead of hers.” ~

-Fran Baskin’s game stretched
from 3:30 until after 7 with the sun
swiftly sinking into the foothills.
Baskin, squinting behind her
sunglasses through most of the
afternoon, split sets, 5-7, 6-3, then
lost the clincher, 5-7.

“She was good but I shouldn’t
have lost,” Baskin said. '

Gordon had Baskin slated to, A

team with Paris for first doubles.

Thorn had Baskin’s "opponent,
Marianne Rice, scheduled for
second doubles. Therefore, neither
of the doubles matches could’ be
played until the completion of the
Baskin-Rice match. By the time

Rice swept past Baskin, it was too

dark for the doubles.

Suggestions ranging from play- 
ing in the dark to rescheduling the.
doubles were considered. Gordon, i

_an active player herself, claimed

rules forbid dropping an unﬁnished
match.
Gordon’s providing a US Tennis
