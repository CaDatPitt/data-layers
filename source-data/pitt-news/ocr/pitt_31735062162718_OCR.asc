SGA Approves
Referendum Of

 New Document
By JACK SMITH

The Student Government

Assn. has approved, by an ov-

erwhelming 17-1 vote, that the

newly proposed Constitution

be brought before the student
body for referendum.

Ray Rowney held the lone dis-_

senting vote, objecting‘ to Article
-’’*-'II, Section 3, point one of the pro-

posed Constitution which states,

_“The Senate shall have the power

to grant recognition to and with-
draw recognition from all student

oi ganizations.”

Rowney objected to this

point saying, “There are some .

s t u d e n t organizations "over
which SGA should have no

power.” He pointed‘ to last year. "

when the Pitt News ‘was brought
before SGA- and accused of
“yellow-dog journalism.” 1
“If this point is to be- kept,”
Rowney continued, “it should de-
ﬁne speciﬁcally what organiza-

tions SGA has the power to con-’

trol.” — ' _

§Delighte—dT—liatHe Took 
Position, Litehfield Says  I 

 

Frank Carver is the new director of. athletics for the

0 become commissioner of

niversity, Chancellor Litchﬁeld announced late yesterday.
Carver, a member of the university’s athletic department

taff for more than 28,years, has been acting athletic director

ince last August when Admiral Thomas Hamilton resigned

the Athletic Association of

Carver, then’ serving as gradu-
ate manager of athletics, at first
declined to put himselfin the run-
ning for the vacant post.

' “We are delighted that Frank
Carver has now consented to

. accept the job,” Dr. Litchﬁeld

said. “As acting athletic direc-
-tor he has provedhimself the

capable . administrator. we need,

and has clearly won the confi-

dence of our faculty, students

and alumni. -

“He is thoroughly familiar with
the’ athletic operation at the uni-
versity, and is known and respect-
ed by college athletic people and
sports writers and announcers all

pleasure to annpunce this ap-
pointment.”

~A native of Beaver,‘ Pa., Carver
began his association with the uni-
versity in 1927 “when he -entered
as a student.’ He was graduated
in 1931, after having worked his
,last two undergraduate years in

in the sports publicity ofﬁce.

’ .»He‘began as full-time sports
publicity director in 1931, and
devoted part of his time during
the 1930's to work in the Uni-
versity News Service.

In December of 1941, a few days
before—Pearl Harbor, Carver took
over as head of the physical edTJ‘-
-cation and the intramural . pro-
grams at the university, and later
doubled as an instructor in phy-
sical education. ~ ‘

Early in 1943, when the Air
Force began to send air cadets
here, Carver was placed in charge
of their physical education train-
ing program. . .

Returning from the service at
the end of 1945, he returned to
the athletic department and

_ served also in the oﬁice of the.
dean of men.

When lqfathletic director James
Hagan left the university in June
of 1948, - Carver was appointed
acting director of athletics’ and
served in’ that position until Ham-
ilton arrived in February of 1949.

In reference to the decorations
for the dance, it was discussed
that possibly only one large
Christmas tree be placed in the
Commons Room, rather than sev-
eral smaller trees.

Dr. Donald. Swarts, MC ad-

money that would be used for the
party would be transferred to the
dance in order to provide punch.

President Ray ,Rowney re- ,

the constitution, judicial, intra-

SGA Kills Political
Party Suhsidization

By KATHRYN GRANT

A 10-4 majority defeated the motion to subsidize political
parties at Monday’s SGA meeting. .

Bob Fulton, Arts ’63, led the arguments for the subsidiz-
ing, stating that the contribution of funds would tend to cre-
ate more partiesand better campaigns.

The arguments against the issue were the facts that par-

. ties are only temporary and their‘

subsidization would attract para-

sites. It was alsopointed out that

the national government does not
subsidize the political parties. "

-Another issue under discussion
was the general disinterest of the
student body. A motion was made
to compel all entering freshmen
to join one extra curricular ac-
tivity.

This motion also met defeat.‘
The majority felt that this would

not arouse genuine interest and
only load organizations with non-
interested rosters.

The appropriations for the men's
council and cheerleaders were
also announced. The former is to
receive $250 this year and the lat-
ter, $200.

Kent Jarrell announced that

there would be no more discus-

sion at the Monday meeting ex-
cept when a motion demanding
discussion is raised.

Next Meet of WPDU

By JULIE THOMAS

The William Pitt Debating Union is in the midst of
preparations for the 12th annual Cross Examination Tourna-
ment to be held here this year, Dec. 11 and 12.

Theseries of debates will bring together some 50 college
teams for.debate on the current national topic, “Resolved:
That Congress should have the power to. reverse decisions of

the Supreme Court.” Participating0

teams will come from 19 states

./. . .
‘ iplus two Canadian provinces and

the West Indies.

'Dr. Mary M. Roberts will de-
rect the activities along with stu-
dent director Gerry Ruth Sack.
Chairmanfor the program will be
‘Jim Lawler.
V Inaugurated in 1948, the Cross-
Examination Tournament is the
biggest tournament of that type
in the country. Although no de-
cisions are given, speakers and
teams are rated and a trophy pre-
sented to the team with the high-

-‘ (est total ratings.

After a series of .»l8 debates at
the University of AOmaha /two
weeks ago, Sophomores Joseph
Hallal and Sherman Fogel of
WPDU won 11 of l3 decisions.
Adding to their victories. in the
mid—west, they entered the semi-
finals at the‘University of Wichita
Varsity Tournament‘ and. placed
third out of the 62 teams compet-
1115'-.

The debates were presented be-.

SGA Constitution OK’d;
Student Body Votes Next

(Continued from Page 1)

is in the present Constitution, the

other members of SGA voted in

favor of the Constitution. The re-
ferendum is expected’, to take
place in the early part of the next

trimester.  ' .

SGA president Kent Jarrell
said, “As the new Constitution
"*~is presented, it seems that, ‘un-
der the trimester system, it will
satisfy the‘ needs of the entire
student body.”

On a motion made‘ by Vice
President Lois Capin, SGA voted
to accept -the_ responsibility ‘of
selling the new” student directory
for‘25 cents ‘each, with the en-
tire proceeds going to the Pitt
Chest.. A s '

In previous years the university
had to pay f_or the Directory, and
the directory for 50
V cents it helped to partially .meet

the cost. This year, through ad-'

vertising, the book is entirely paid
for. But SGA felt, rather than
give the book away, it would
charge a token fee with proceeds

and were on the national topic
“Resolved: That Congress should
have the Power to-Reserve Deci-
sions of the Supreme Court.”

The top rankingyteam in the
Purdue Tournament, also held
two weeks ago, was the Pitt
team of John Strauch and Tom
Ribich. Taking the’ affirmative
on the national topic, Strauch
and Ribich won three out of
four decisions. _

Of the 72 debaters participating,

Strauch, president of WPDU, was

named the _top individual in the-

tournament. Gerry Ruth Sack and
Arleen Russell, who debated the

-negative at Purdue, were awarded

one decision out offour. 2
At’ Duquesne University WP
DU’s varsity team won-six out-of

eight‘ debates and placed third’

in the tournament. The team con-
sisted of sophomores Charelle
Marple and Thomas Kyper on the
affirmative and Willis Higgins and

Ann Abbinanti taking the nega-

tive.

The proposed constitution of the Student Government

Basically, the document that shortly will be--presented
to the entire student body as a referendum, separates the
powers and duties of the governing body into the three con-
ventional branches to which we in the United States are
accustomed: executive, legislative and judicial.

This separation represents the most signiﬁcant improve-
ment over the document now in effect. First, the legislative
body, to be known as the Senate, will be ‘free from the
administrative functions SGA now has to perform.

In most cases, these functions are trivialities that only

ample, if the recording secretary of SGA needs paper on

if ’ which to write the minutes of the meetings, shemust ask

the approval of the entire body to buy it.

p The Trimester Commission, out of whose work the pro-
posed constitution evolved, has been wise, too‘, in creating
a Supreme Court as a separate entity from the legislature

a committee of SGA. and has been non-functioning. A strong
court can be an asset to any student body. .
As for the president of the student body, he will possess

lies mainly inthe power of veto given the chief executive.
At ﬁ.rst glance, one would feel that the Senate’s power to
override a veto balances this power of the president.
But easier things can be accomplished than receiving a_
two-thirds vote from the Senate, ‘ -
Even though it is feasible that in any given year a pres-
" ident could‘ employ his veto power“to too great a degree,
~ we believe a strong chief executive can work well forthe
student body. I
One doubt concerning the president, though, is his term
of oilice which lasts for three trimesters. If he does not reg-
-ister for one of the trimesters, which is likely in the major-
ity of -cases, the president nevertheless retains his ‘title. The
vice president, then, would probably handle the adminis-
trative duties, ,
But if this is the case, we see no reason why the presi-
dent should be president. « V
Besides the improvement in structure, the most import-
‘ant change lies in the new form of representation. Under
the present system, representation from living units and ac-
tivities makes little sense. The new delegation will come
from the schools and the classes.
. Commenting in general, the Student Government Con-
stitution is better theoretically than what we have now.
Just how much better it will be in practice depends on
"something else. It must be accepted -by the entire‘student
body——accepted not only in the referendum, but also accept-
ed- actively throughout its existence.

Several weeks ago various members of the
Pitt News staff and of the staff of Ideas and Figures
were sitting in a place in Greenwich Village called
the Bizarre. The Bizarre is a very much com-
mercialized hang-out of the beat generation. Murals
with distorted figures cover the
, walls, and waitresses and waiters
both dressed in tight black pants
and sweaters parade ba_ck and
forth taking orders.

Jazz can be heard through,

the amplifying system, and in the
center of the room there is a
chair on a platform with a mi-
crlophone suspended above it. It
is in this chair that the poet,
Ted Joans sits. Mr. Joans is tall,
thin, bearded,
blue jeans and a crew neck. Beside him one can
see a portfolio filled and overflowing with type-

had already though about all of these points ex-
cept" perhaps the first and the last. ‘

Much of Mr. Joans poetry was addressed to
the “Jivy Leaguer.” The “Jivy Leaguer” is defined
as one who listens to Dave Brubeck. At least this
is the onlycoherent definition that I" could glean
from the plethora of words. Somehow all of us

and we also wondered how he could take money
from people who had defied the television repair-

After Mr. J oans left our table, we came to’ some
conclusions about Mr. Joans and about the genera-
tion which he claims to represent. We decided ‘that
his poetry was entirely without artistic dicipline,
and without intellectual meaning. We thought of
poets who had spent nine or ten years perfecting
one poem, and we glanced suspiciously at Mr.
Joans overflowing portfolio of typewritten pages.

We thought about what Mr. Joans had said con- '
cerning war, materialism, and death, and, we coi_n- '
pared. hisremarks to those of Linus Pauling con--1
cerning war, to those of David Reisman concern-

ing materialism, a_nd to those of. Albert ‘Camus

We thought of the utter lack of human solidar-
ity and ‘of human compassion expressed in both
the attitude and the poetry of Mr. Joans, and we
realized that the beats do, not understand the
meaning of human love. Last we thought about the
brilliant and sensitive intellec_tuals who spend their
lives trying to reform a society by living in ‘it, .
-but who never once accept any vailtiesof that so- I

We left Greenwich Village ‘with the feeling of

Letters To Tiheiditor  

Fine Arts Building -
Erection Defended
Editor, the Pitt News:

I am happy to reply to Betty
Haughey’s letter in your issue
of Nov. 18 regarding the wisdom

of‘“constructing a new Fine Arts
building.

The money is a gift from as
private donor and would not be ~

available to the university for
any other use. -

(Miss Haughey felt the money, ’

coming_ from an anonymous
source, could be put to better
use than constructing a fine arts
. building.) A

In the light of this it would

seem that even those who have

no interest in the arts should.

rejoice at the»dist,inctio'n which
will come to the university from

such a gift. The point is of‘

course arguable but it might be
that what the university needs
most is a greater awareness of
the signiﬁcance of the arts.

Certainly no other subject is,

so revealing as to the‘, experience
of man on this planet, his reli-
gion, his philosophy, his very
nature.

It is also true that nothing
could put Pitt more in line with
the great universities of the
world than an increased interest
in the arts as a basis for under-
standing the problems which
confront the scholar.

Encourage Parties,

Don’t Abolish Them
Editor, the Pitt News:'

,.This letter is‘ in regard "to
your editorialentitled, “Abolish
Political Parties” (Nov. 18)‘. As
we realize, the past elections at
the universitywere a farce.’ But
you can’t better’ this situation. by
abolishing political parties.

In your editorial you stated
that certain groups set them-

selves up as ‘‘_organizers’’ and .

exclude others who they feel
are unworthy» This situation is
quite prevalent. It can be stop-
ped by building’ a political party
around a personality instead of
the situation now where the “or-
ganizers” scrape around to ﬁnd,
people. By building the party
around ‘a popular candidate the
natural leadership, ‘which is
lacking now, would appear.

Your examples of past voting
records are the best examples of
good political parties. In 1958
when over 2,000 voted, there was
a two-party race between the
United Independents and the
Allied Collegiates.

Against last year when over

1,300 voted, there was again a‘

two-party race between the "Pitt
Action Party and the AC’s. But
this year when there was only
one party, the elections dropped
off to 760 voters. These statistics,
I feel, are an ample _reason to
encourage, not abolish, political
parties. ,, , 3

I personally feel. that the best
way to strengthen. parties is to
-SGZ_&"Enbs'di,z ” the parties‘

The irresponsibilities of the
parties can be. correctedby a
stricter enforcement of the rules
by the election committee, more
capable leadership, of the ‘par-

and_ well-led parties should be of
higher esteem ‘than the present

FOOTBALL: ITS CAUSE AND CURE

  

Nest Saturday at the football game while you are sitting in your
choice student's seat behind the end zone, won’t you give a
thought to Alaric Sigafoos? - — *

Alaric Sigafoos (1868-1934) started life humbly on 9. farm
near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both named Ralph, —
’ were beau—gleaners, and Alaric became a bean-gleaner too. Later
he moved toOregon and found work with a logging firm as a
stump-thumper. Then he went to North Dakota. Where he
tended the furnace in a. granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted
to Texas where he tidied up oil ﬁelds (pipe—wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (ﬁg-rigger). Then to Ken-
tucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat-toter). Then
to Long Island where be dressed poultry (duck-plucker). Then
to Alaska where he drove a delivery van for a bakery (bread-
sledder). Then to Minnesota where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-
slicer). Then to Nevada where he computed odds in a gambling
house (dice-pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted czuncra
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer). _
Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a. tauncry
beating pig hides until they were soft and supple (l1ng—fl0ggcr.)
Here he found happiness at last. ' ’

Why, you ask, did he find happiness at last? Liglit at ﬁrm and
fragrant Marlboro, taste those better ma.kin.’s, enjoy that filter
that ﬁlters like no other ﬁlter ﬁlters, possess your souls in sweet:
content, cross your little fat legs, and read on.

N ext door to Alaric’s hog;-ﬂoggery was an almond grove owned! »
by a. girl named Chimera Emrick. Chimera was pink and white
and marvelously hinged, and Alaric was instantly in love. Each
day he came to the almond grove to woo. Chimera, but she, alas,
/ stayed cool. i '

Then one (.l:.l._V Alaric got a. brilliant idea. It was the day be-
fore the annual Omaha. Almond Festival. On this duly, as every-
one knows, all the almond growers in Omaha. enter ﬂoats in the
big parade. These ﬂoats always consist of large cardboard’ ali-
lY)0llClSl_1tl.llg'lIlg from large cardboard almond trees.

A.laric’s inspirati.on was to stitch pieces of pigskin together
and inﬂate them until‘ they looked like big, plump almonds.

“These sure beat skinny old cardboard. almonds," said» Alario
to himself. “To1noi'row they will? surely ta.ke- ﬁrst prize for
Cl1im.cru.'a.nd she will be mine!”

Early the next morning Alaric carried his lovely inflated’ pig- - _,
skin almonds over to Chimera, but she, alas, had run. off during >32-
the night with Walter T. Severidge, her broker. Alarit: flew into
such a rage that he started. kicking-his pigskin-almonds all? over
the place. And who should be walking by that very instant but.

Mr. Doubleday had invented 'baseball the day before, and he
was now trying to invent football, but he was, stymied‘ because
he couldn’t figure out what» kind of ball. to use. Now, seeing
Alaric kick the pigskin spheroids, his problem was suddenly
solved. "Eur-eke!” he cried and ran to his drawing board and
invented football, which wassuch a big success that he was in-
spired to go on and invent lacrosse, Monopoly, run sheep run

Soccer Eleven
 Looks Toward
A Bright Future

By TED COLTON

For ﬁve long frustrating years Leo Bemis, coach of the
Panther soccer team, has been trying to beat.Penn State. A
week ago Saturday this feat was ﬁnally accomplished when
the booters defeated a mediocre Lions team, 1-0.

This ended State’s superior reign over the Panthers in

‘soccer. The win for the Cats should be signiﬁcant because’

it may have started a new reign.

The Panthers have slowly been building their schedule
into one of the toughest in the nation. Each year better teams
areadded. St. Louis and West Chester, two of the top teams
in the Mid-West if not in the country, were added for next
year. , Last year Michigan State, which had been undefeated
in three seasons of varsity competition, was added. '

With the top ﬂight schedule the Panthers now have,
they are going to need -the material to’ cope with it.

‘Here they are at a big disadvantage. Competing with
such schools as St. Louis, West Chester, Michigan State
and Penn State, Mr. Bemis ﬁnds himself at the bottom of
the pile, because of one ‘glaring fact. ' '

The Panthers give no soccer scholarships whereas most
of‘ their opponents do. In order for Bemis to_ get a good
soccer player to come to Pitt he must write the boy, offering
him only the friendly atmosphere T of campus life and the
high scholastic rating the school has acquired in the last
few years.

\ But despite this handicap, all is not lost in the Panthers
cause. As a matter of fact next year’s team shows signs of
not only playing the tough schedule "but coming out of it
witha good record and a chance to go to the NCAA play-offs.

The big factor will be the goalie position. If George Zani-
copoulos, who set a record for Panther goalies by letting only
13 shots get by him all year, can return, then the booters will
be in good-shape. ,

Zeek, as he is called, is listed as a senior but has
one more year of eligibility left. Bemis is trying to talk
him into staying.

Next year the Cats will also have to bolster their
defense. The loss of Ron Wyatt, Tom Young, Ron Pod-
milsak and Bob _Murdock will weaken this area, which
has been the backbone of Panther teams for the last
few years. .

The offensive picture is much brighter. For the ﬁrst time
in years the Blue and Gold should have two good scorers on
the front line. Simeon Pestich, this year leading scorer, and
Bob Cuthbert, up from the freshmen squad, should provide
Bemis with a good one-two scoring punch.

Next year the varsity soccer will be starting its seventh
season. The overall record of the club in their ﬁrst six years
is 36-22-3. This record has been achieved by boys who ﬁnd
time to play soccer in their spare time. Most of these boys
have had no previous soccer experience before coming to
Pitt. This is truly a tribute to Mr. Bemis and the Panther

booters.

With teams such as Ohio State,
West. Virginia, St. John’s and

Panthers will need a couple of

i Panther.Swim Team Prepares

F or Opener With Maryland

, V By BILL NEFF .
 As the coldrweather sets in, probably the furthest thing
“from the mind of most University students is a nice’ refresh-
ing dip. But for the Panther varsity swimming team the

-”~<

w

7""

daily dip is just part of the routine as they prepare for what

looks like 'a strong setof "opponents. '
The Panther mermen open their season at home on De-

cember 12th when they are sched—9

uled to meet astrong Maryland

squad. Last year it will be remem-

bered‘ that the Maryland mermen
_were only edged by the. margin
of ten points, 48-38, with the
Panther tankers winning the meet
on the last event of the match. ‘

The Blue and Gold tankers will
be without the services of its last
years co-captains Ken Cooper and
Chuck Nanz, and it goes without
saying Coach Ben Grady will have
to do somewhard looking to find
someone to ‘fill the gap left by
Eastern ' Champion Backstroker
Willis Weisz. - I

Coach Grady will be counting
heavily upon the performances of
last years lettermen such as _Bart
Haas, who holds the 50-yard
ECSA Championship. Jim Emert,
Pat Fitzgerald, Len Paganini, Tony

Treser, and Barry_Kent will all

be primary. contenders for the
freestyle spots on the team. ,
In the butterfly department
“ it will be Tony Sarsfield and
Bob Zielels battleing it out for
top team honors. One of the
~ Panther mermens strongest
events should be the diving with
twojunior divers, Kevin Keller
and Jerry Irwin competing for
the laurels.

The Tankers picked up two new
opponents for this season in the
form of -VMI and Notre Dame of
which both meets will be played
away. Dropped from the Blue and

Gold’s schedule were Rutgers and
Washington and Lee College.

Commenting on the seasons
prospects Coach Grady had this

to say, “We have a~tough season’

ahead of us but I feel the team
should make a good showing. We
have a lot of underclass talent that
should «develop during the season.

To sum it up we have a good,

potential, but only time will tell.”

NAA's On-Campuslnterviews DECEMBER 11. I959

EARLY EVERY my you read of another ad-
vance. in science . . . whether it's a space
vehicle streaking toward Venus or a“sub-,
marine gliding beneath the polar ice.
These are the events that make head-

I to the world, engineers and scientists are
planning new and greater achievements
—and research shows them the way. _

Scientiﬁc research always has had an important role at
North American Aviation. Today, research projects are
underway-at, more than 185 laboratories in the six North
American divisions. They encompass the full scope of mod-
ern science.

Is air stiffer than steel?

Not all research has the headline appeal. of a space ship
or nuclear power. For example, research engineers at the
Autonetics Division, which designs and manufactures space-
age navigation systems, found new and differenttways of
building rotating bearings . . . and found that air is stiffer than

 

-steel for some purposes. Improved gyroscopes and magnetic

recordings were important results of this research.

A cigarette’: place In: research _
Even the ordinary cigarette has a role in scientiﬁc research.
Scientists at the Aero-Space Laboratories, an organization

within North American’s Missile Division, use a burning cig- -

arette in a still room to illustrate the difference between
laminar ﬂow and turbulence in the boundary layer, the very
thin air space that lies along the outer skin of an aircraft or
missile. This research is part of a program to ﬁnd ways to
protect missiles, satellites and space ships from burning when

‘ they re-enter the earth's atmosphere.

Toward the conquest of Space

The Rocketdyne Division has designed and built the bulk‘

of today's operating hardware in the high-thrust rocket ﬁeld.
Explorer I, America’s'ﬁrst satellite, was boosted into orbit by
a Rocketdyne engine...and three-fourths of the power for
Able IV-Atlas-man's ﬁrst attempt to reach toward another
planet-comes from liquid-propellant engines designed and
built by Rocketdyne. Researchers at Rocketdyne delve into

2,00_0mph manned weapon system r
The Los Angeles Division is the" home of next-"generation
manned weapon system, the Mach 3-B-70 Valkyrie strategic
bomber, and America's , ﬁrst -manned space " vehicle, . the
X-15. Research engineers in this division investigate manu-
facturing techniques, conduct studies in aerodynamics, mate-
rials. and processes, and thermodynamics.HThey also work
with physiologists, biotechnologists, biophysicists,‘and psy-
‘ chologists to solve design problems concerning human capa-
bilities and limitations that arise from modern weapons and
research systems. '

Building Better Navy aircraft

Analysis of aircraft_carrier operation is a major research
project at the Columbus Division. This division designed and
..built the Navy's T2J Buckeye jettrainer and the Navy's
supersonic, all-weather A3J Vigilante. Research activities
are diverse here—from how to illuminate an aircraft cockpit
to developing unmanned vehicles and systems to perform
within the earth's atmosphere. "

Developing the peaceful atom

The work at the Atomics International Division of North
American is~part of a large national -research effort aimed at
the peaceful atom. Success in the development of economical
power from the atom depends‘ on thorough knowledge in
every phase of atomic power systems and their materials of I
construction. Atomics International research reactors are in
service in Japan, Denmark, West Germany, West Berlin, and

taly. - 9

.Opportunities for college graduates
Today at North American there is outstanding opportunity
for young engineers who want to share the unusual creative
problems that face science. You can rapidly build a sound
engineering career by working on the top-level projects now
underway. Visit your placement oﬂice where you'll ﬁnd all
the facts about a challenging and rewarding future with
North American.
