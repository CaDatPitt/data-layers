Pitt-VIP Urge Better Relations

By ED BACHMAN '
(For Complete List of Party Slates, See Page 5) ‘

. ‘ Pitt’s three political parties have completed their slates
and platforms for the Mar. 30 school elections, but upon a
survey of their lists, one item has been overlooked. A short-

wage of candidates bidding for class ofﬁcer positions, except
-in the  School, will necessitate another election period
in the near-future. .

Five oﬁicers are to be elected for various classes but the
Panther Party slate and the combined slate of V.I.P. and the
Pitt Party each have named only two men. With the top
'vote—getter being elected president, the other three. candi-
dates will be ‘assured of class oﬁice. It ‘Will then be the
responsibility of individual presidents to hold a class election
«for ﬁfth man soon after general school elections.

' Parties will face more difficulty in their quest to get
complete slates: ' ‘

openly campaign for their choices,
however. Pitt and V.I.P. parties

‘ while Panther has slated only

men.
Party chairmen have released
election platforms. ~ .
The three planks of the Pan-
ther Party emphasize accom-
plishments of’ student leaders
and blast SC for lack of econ-
omy: “First, we need class of-
ﬁcers more than We need title-
holders, with class sponsored-
activities such as the school-

‘ wide dances begun this year by

PantheF-men, , Trattner, Wilkins,
and Shapiro.

“Second, we want a continua-
tion of progress in the , Men’s
Council program of which Panther
men have played a vital role; a
continuation of improvement -in
the already revitalized counseling
program; and advancement in the
newly recognized party setups.

A Eﬂiciency Needed in SC

“Third, let’s introduce efﬁciency
and activity in Congress. Men-
women relations must be improved
—-a problem which has
shirked. Financial waste must be
stopped; such as $750 waste for
half-organized ineffective Assem-
blies Committee programs. An ap-
pointments committee must make
appointments before they are
weeks too late. Let’s have more
ﬁre and less moke in Public Rela-
tions and -real Student-Faculty re-
lationship.’’ ' -

Pitt and V.I.P. have offered

BetsieNorbart, a Dutch war orphan, really has 16 par-

years ago, in June, 1948, Pitt’s

the Foster Parents’ Plan for War Children, adopted Betsie.
Since then, each spring, Panhellenic, in cooperation with the

16 sororities, sends $180 to t
Betsie’s care. 1'

Under this plan she _receives¢
food, clothing, medical- and dental
care, attends school, and receives
a small monthly allowance for
her home needs.

Betsie was only eight-years
old when she was adopted by
Panhellenic. She is the sixth of
a family of seven children-all
of whom are now in different
foster homes. Betsie’s parents,
Theodoris and Cornelia. Van
Fes-sen Norbart, died during the
war, leaving the seven children
"destitute and alone. ,

Their mother, Cornelia, died in
January, 1944, as a result of the
hardships and diseases of war.
Their father, Theodoris Norbart,
was injured in a bombing raid in
1944 anddied from these injuries
a year later.

Betsie was then taken to" Am-
sterdam to the home of distant
relatives who already had two
children of their own. The Foster
Parents’ Plan reports their mod-

kitchen, and three bedrooms. The
house is clean but barely furnish-

She was unable to continue her
schooling because she was needed
to help her aunt, who now has a
family of four. Betsie’s real
brothers and sisters are still in
different foster homes and have

little contact with each other. Al-
though Betsie is a quiet person,
she is more confident now than
she was when she first came into
her foster home.

This summer, Jane Pickering,
a member of Delta Zeta soror-

M“i’gHl'y  Motes

By Jim Deweese
Pitt—is oiice again in the back—slapping, hand-
shaking grip of student politics. March 30th is the
date on which that grip will once again turn to
jelly as ballots are cast for officers in all depart-
ments of the school., This time of year could hardly
be more appropriate, what with buds budding,
ﬂowers ﬂowering, and politicians politicking all
over zthe place. ~
Once (each year, at this time,
the plumage of the «politicos may
be seen as they bound from booth
to booth in the tuck shops ex-
tracting votes like decayed
molars. Two‘ basic methods are
employed by the hunters as they
track down their unaffiliated vic-
lIlI1’lS. _,x
The ﬁrst of these two meth-
ods is the more harmless, adhering to the “You
know how much needs to be done around here
that ‘was neglected» by the people now in oflice
which I plan to‘ rectify when you vote me into office
next week and let me buy that coffee for you”
school of thought.
The Natives Are_RestIess . i
0 The second method is used as a direct crack by
the men while the women, because they aren’t
women but ladies, are forcedto stand at the edge

of the jungle and sandwich their ladylike insinua- ‘

 

tions betyveen the rifts in the blue air. ‘These in-
lsinuations and direct attacks run the gamut from
exploded fact to slurs cast on the opponents» an-
cestry.

One of the most popular falacies regarding elec-

tions is that which names the voter as the most 3

important single factor. This practice is propagated

in order to get you up off your overstuffed seat (in _
the tuck shop) and to the polls. Adrenilin is no

longer enough. At any rate, as the saying goes,
you are a real nothing. Its the guy that gets your
vote who must be called (apologies to John Dos
Passos) Number One.

VRun. Do Not Walk

People run for political office for a number of
reasons. Some want the name that goes with the
ofﬁce, never having been properly named before.
Some, run to keep from falling on their faces as a
result of the tremendous push which their party
leaders have given them. Many don’t know Why
they are running but don’t want to stop because it
puts them in the public eye, like any common ash.
And some are running and don’t know it. These
are the men, I think.

The women’s elections are so involved

' in fact you might as well forget about ’em because

I can’t explain how they serve the University or
beneﬁt the students any better than the ofﬁcers
of the various groups themselves. ‘

So there you are. 1 i

Is it really. . .

By Joan Thomas .

One wonders ‘ whether
long-awaited Student Union is
actually for the students, or if it
is to be an added attraction to
the Natinality Rooms, Commons
Room, and the Heinz Chapel
‘which visitors flock to see. In-
stead of its
being a com-

1935, and Heinz Chapel was com-

pleted in 1938. This is 1955.
University architects propose a
suggestion of height, sugges-
tion of arches, suggestion, of

pose a suggestion of warmth;

Under the proposed plan, only

pleted in its ﬁrst stage, due to

- lack of funds. The added cost of

the modiﬁed Gothic over a mod-
ern design is an estimated 60%
per square foot. And the Union
and the dormitories will probably
be incomplete until the day they

decay, in keeping with the Ca- ,_

thedral’s brick walls, unsightly

cafeteria, bare light bulbs at the *

entrances, and lack of elevators.
To further counteract the ex-

pense in the Gothic architecture,-

students living in dormitories
will eatall three meals in the
cafeteria,,,instead of family-type
meals. They will miss what even
students of small‘ church-sup-
ported schools, enjoy-—being

phrase “gracious 1iving” rings on

Architects are spending addi-

tional money on the higher cost

of multiple purpose rooms. The
high price of making a room

functional for various purposes

isfreely admitted. Cost of stor-
age space is enoromous. If they
haveatheir way, rooms will be
designed for overlapping ‘facili-

Need Only Top Two 0

A Pitt-VIP man told me that
his party was only interested in

class. They only concerned them-

selves with placing in ofﬁce a»

cause one automatically served

potential for increasing student

class officers and a rather closely-

_Yet class officers will remain

pleased you enough to make you want to clip it out and keep 
But I'm sure that being" preoccupied with more important things
— like getting- down to breakfast before your room-mate eats
all the marmalade -— the impulse has passed and been forgotten.

So I am pleased now to report that the makers of Philip Morris
Cigarettes, bless their corporate hearts,'have published a booklet

. called MAX SHULMAN REVISITED, which contains six of

my favorite columns, along with some brand new material, all
of this profusely il1ustrated—a11 of this available to you gratis
when you buy a couple of packs of Philip Morris at your favorite

A thropology at Southern ..Reserve University and internationally
known as an authority on primitive peoples, returned yesterday‘

from a founyar scientiﬁc expedition to the headwaters of the

Amazon River. Among the many interesting mementos of his _

journey is his own head, shrunk-to thesize of a kumquat. He
refused to reveal how his, head shrinking‘ was accomplished.

Northern Reserve University .

Dr. Mandrill Gibbon, head of the department of zoology at
Northern Reserve University and known to young and old for
his work on primates, announced yesterday that he had received
a grant of $80,000,000 for a twelve year study to determine
precisely how much fun ‘there is in a barrel of monkeys.

« Whatever the results of Dr. Gibbon’s researches, this much
is already known: what's more fun that a barrel of monkeys is

a pack of Philip Morris. There’s zest and cheer in every puff, ‘A

delight in every draw, content and_ well-being in every ﬂeecy,
ﬂavorful cloudlet. Adid, what's more, this merriest of cigarettes,
king-size and regular, comes in the exclusive Philip Morris

origins of early Gothic “runes,” as letters of primitive alphabets
are called. I .

Dr. Tristram Lathrop Spleen, famed far and wide as the
discoverer of the High German Consonant Shift, read a paper

(pronounced “krahtz”) to the middle Lettic rune “gr” (pro-
nounced “albert”) . On the other hand, Dr. Richard Cummerbund
Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows, translated The Pajama.
Game into Middle High Bactrian,..~contended in his paper. that
the Old Wendish rune “pt” derives from the Low Erse rune “mf”
(pronounced “gr”). . 0

Well, sir, the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkey
ﬁnally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gym-

_nasium and put on the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the challenge

promptly, ‘but the contest was never held because there were
no gloves in the gymnasium that would ﬁt Dr. Twonkey.

(The reader is doubtlessbfinding this hard to believe as ’
Eastern Reserve University is celebrated the length and breadth '

of the land for the size of its glove collection. However, the reader
is asked to remember that Dr. Twonkey has extraordinarily
small hands and arms. In fact, he spent the’ last war working
in a small arms plant, where he received two Navy “E” Awards

and was widely hailed as a “manly little chap.”)

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Coach Rex Peery’s Eastern

champs go after even greater

glory Friday and Saturday when they compete in the twenty-
ﬁfth National Collegiate wrestling championships at Ithaca,

New York-—home of Cornell’s

Big Red. _

Besides defending titlist Oklahoma A&M, other possi-
bilities to take top honors are Michigan, Iowa, Oklahoma,

Last year, the Peerymen

Peery believes that if the Bluee

placed second to the Aggies with

and Gold can capture two firsts
and place several more, chances
of finishing near the top of the
list can become a reality in light
of the star grapplers beingspread
out among so many different
Schools.

Although there are ten weight
classes in the tourney, the 10-
cals will have ‘entries in only
six of them.

The six that are being counted
on toecarry the colors of Sky-'
scraper U., are Bill Hulings at
115, Ed Peery_ at 123, Bob Cook
at 147, Ed DeWitt at 157, Joe Sol-
omon at 167, and Ron Schirf i.n
the l91—pound division.

I-Iulings, Peery, Dewitt, and
Solomon have each dropped one
Weight class in order to strengthen
the locals’ chances‘ of winning the
nationals. This will be the first
national tourney for Hulings and
Peery while Solomon will be out
to retain the 167-pound crown
that he won last year.

Lost for the tourney because
of a rib injury is Dan Wisnewski.
The Erie heavy was sadly missed
in the Ea~ste1?ns and _was being
counted on to help the Panthers
in the Nationals, but the injury

A shoulder injury suffered re-
cently by Ned Blass, 1l77—pound
winner the last two years, cuts
heavily into the undefeated
Aggies’ chances of retaining the
crown they have won 16 times
and shared once since 1928. If
Blass is unable to go, this may
be just the’ break the Peerymen
need to slip ahead of the Aggies
and win the title.

Five members of Pitt’s

Eastern Collegiate swimming’

championships team left today for Oxford, Ohio, where they
will compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion swimming championships. '

The event will start tomorrow and run through Satur-
day, Mar. 26. The top swimmers in the country will be fea-

tured as they strive for the six places awarded points in each .
event. . . 9 '

Representing the Blue and Gold
at the event will be Jim Zurcher,
Skip Monsein, Roy Kaupe, Warne
White, and Bill Furrer.

Monsein, a double winner in the
Easterns, will compete in the 100
and 200—yard backstroke events.
Zurcher, also a two-time Eastern
champ will swim in the 220 and
440—yard rfreestyles, while Captain
Bill Furrer will participate in the
440 and 1500 meter freestyle
events. -

White will carry the Panther

medley to complete the entries for
the locals. .

style relaye teams will also try
for honors at the Nationals. Mon-

sein, Kaupe and White will swim
in the medley relay while Zurcher,
Furrer, Kaupe and White will be

entered in the freestyle relay
«event.

Ohio State, winner or last year’s
event, is a slight favorite to retain
its crown, but should receive stiff
competition from Michigan, Yale,
Harvard, and Stanfod.

' The last man to place for Pitt
in the NCAA championships was

1_9'5~2, ’5-3, and ’54. Coach Grady
doesn’t think that any of his
present crop will place, but added,
“You can never tell with the spirit
these. boys have, though. They
just might fool a lot of people and
score some points”,

 

  

If you’ve watched them on
the course, you’ve probably
thought: “Boy, if I could
just get my game down like
that!” i

Constant practice is the answer, of course, but getting the be

from your equipment is just as

important, too. 

That’s where Spalding TOP-FLITE® clubs have the edge.
They have more to oﬂer in precision balance that gives an
absolutely uniform swingfeel with every club in the matched set.

That’s the secret of Spalding SYNCHRO-Di’iNED® clubs.
And, it will pay off for you from the first round. You’ll make
the same shots with new uniformity. The perfect balance of
these clubs lets you swing through the ball with conﬁdence.
Without “cholfing-up” or “compensating.” You get the ball A
away cleaner, longer, and with more shot control.‘

These are the clubs that have lo wered handicaps by as much as
1/3: Spalding SYNCHRO-D~YNED TOP=FLITE clubs. Your Golf
pro has them now. And, now’s the time for you to start playing

better golf.

Football Official
Praises Fins

By DAVE AMAZER
Sports Editor

 

Comments concerning good work are always appreciated 

whether they be from friends, foes, or from people not
even connected with the subject. E

, It is in this latter category that a letter was received
from George E. Little this week complimenting the Panther
swimming team on their accomplishments. I think that his

brief statement can be even more appreciated when it is :

noted that the writer is one of the old-time ﬁgures in college
athletics and one who knows his topic well.

’ Previously he was football coach at both Michigan and
Wisconsin, athletic director at the latter institution and the
same for ‘many years at Rutgers. Not content to retire, he
is now doing an energetic job as-the Executive Secretary of
the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame, located
on the Rutgers University campus.

It is in this capacity that he decided to send the follow-
ing note: I _ V ' _ '

For the pastﬁfteen years or more, it has been a real tribute
to the swimming squad of the University of Pittsburgh to regard
their standing in Eastern swimming’ circles Sufficient to send 31!‘
nually two private carloads of P€l‘f°Yme1‘S 0V9!‘ the Allegheny
Mountains to compete in this twenty ‘ team championship-

It is little wonder, therefore, that for the fourth consecu-
tive time, Coach Ben Grady and his well-balanced swimming
team carried away the trophy Saturday evening, March 12th..)
Please convey my respects and those of all Rutgers people for
the determined manner in which Pittsburgh’s swimming forces

, have carried through their aquatic objectives.
(Signed) George E. Little
Executive Secretary.
=1: :1: 4: ,

Wrestling Coach Rex Peery is taking only six men to the Nationals
yet agrees that Pitt stands asggood a chance of copping the top spot

as they did last season with eight entries.

Basis for opinion lies in that this sextet represents -a stronger.
group, collectively, then last season’s squad. The group would have

been one larger if Danny 'Wisnewski was not injured. The big foot-
baller showed real well during the dual meet season and was. ex-
pected to be the Blue and Gold’s entry in the heavyweight division
at Nationals, but, unfortunately, his rib injury hasn’t healed enough
to put him back in action. ’ ‘

Lambs Down Central Vikings
For All-Campus Hoop Grown

- By HARVEY RUDY I
With footballers Bob Pollock and. Glen Dillon leading
the way, the Lambs put on a third period sf;u\'t to down the
Central Vikings, 43-30, for the All-Campus Basketball Cham-
pionship Monday at the Field House. V
The first half saw ﬁery. Regis Filtz sparking _the
Lamb offensive with able assistance from Jim Flathery.
The early moments of the fray showed the score changing
hands constantly, as Arnie Roheiv
and Joe Flynn "kept the Vikings canning three pivit shots and Flat-
hery breaking free for layups to
maintain‘ their lead throughout
the remainder of the game.
Tech Next
Although the Central Vikings
played aggressive ‘‘ and inspired

its close, two jump shots by Flath-
ery plus a Dillon one-hander
opened the gap to 17-15 for the
Lambs at intermission.
The Lambs’ came out with a

fury in the second half and, us-

ing a ‘torrid fast -break, almost

Dillon started the scoring when
he netted two on a neat feed from
Bob McQuaide.
, Lambs Come Back

Flynn hit for the Vikings on a
line-drive set from the corner
but the Lambs followed with a
deluge of points as Filtz found the
range on three consecutive field
goal attempts in addition to con-
verting -on two foul shots to lead
his team to a 31-21 margin at the
end of the third quarter.

Roher swished a push shot as
the final period got underway and
then he and Bruce Hartner each
added two foul shots to cut the
lead to four points. However, the
Lambs roared back wih Filtz
