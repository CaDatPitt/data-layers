speak.

Dr. French was the director of
the Office of Student Ratings at
Washington. In this position she
was administrator of a’ student
evaluation program for ten years.

Programs Now in Effect

Student evaluation programs
are in effect at many universities
in the United States. The opera-
tion of various plans, however,
varies.

In several Ivy League schools
students themselves publish a
rating to inform students of the
capabilities and personalities of
the instructors. These plans are
not always successful according
to Dr. French.

The faculty backed plan there is
based on research begun in 1927
by Dr. Guthries, a psychologist at
Washington, who studied student
opinion to see if it was reliablein
instructor evaluation.

Started in, 1944

Dr. French was working with
the ‘plan as early as 1944 in the
office for Educational Research at
Washington and was nade direc-
tor of the Student Ratings Olﬁce
in 1947.

She remained in this position
until she came to Pitt as staff as-
sociate in the Ofﬁce of Education-
al Research here.

The purpose of the Washing-
ton plan, she said is to provide
the instructors with a guide of
student opinion by which toiim-
prove their teaching methods.

The ‘saying at Washington, she
said, is “Student judgment of
teaching is inevitable and ines-
capable -— the only question is
whether or not the faculty mem-
ber wants to know it is.”

At the meeting tomorrow Dr. —"

French will explain to both. fac-

’\

ulty and students the various stu- _
dent evaluation plans and their

mechanics. The meeting is open
and will include an open discuss
510“ and question period.

Dean of Women & Associate Visit Europe

Miss Rush Tours
England and Wales

In Lecture Series
BY DONNA CONSIDINE
Abandoning the role of
sight-seeing tourists abroad
this winter, Dean of Women
Helen P, Rush and Associate
Dean Savina S. Skewis, con-

cerned themselves with ob-

serving life in the academic
sphere.

The reason for this concentra-
tion was the nature of Miss Rush’s
trip, a lecture tour of the British
Isles, Oct. 21 to Nov. 30.

Had Varied Audience _
Recipient of a Winifred Cullis
Lecture Fellowship sponsored by
the British-American Associates,
she spoke before school boys and
girls, Rotary Clubs, Round tables,
forums, British Federation of Uni-
versity Women, English Speaking
Union, and Women’s Gas Federa-
tiony
Among her‘ alternated topics
were: “At What Is American Edu-
cation Aiming?” “The Contempo-
Woman,” and
“Homes and Families in the Unit-
ed States.” They were delivered in
both large and small cities scat-
tered throughout England.
Miss Bush was impressed
-with the hospitality and respon-
siveness which she found in Eng-
lish homes where she stayed be-
tween lectures. Of her audiences
the Dean of Women stated, “In
every instance they were eager
to hear about American life.”
One misconception she encoun-

matriarchy. “I feel very strongly
it isn’t,” she stressed. “I was also
amazed at the number of people
who asked me if we take tran-
quillizers to keep going at our
rapid pace.” \

Short Visit to Wales

Her only talk outside England
was in Cardiff, Wales. With a brief
look at the Welsh people, she felt
that they are gayer and more out-
goinglthan their English neigh-
borsi .

After a short visit to Copen-
hagen, Miss Rush ﬂew to Berlin
where Miss Skewis joined her in
mid-December. .

They attribute the warm wel-
come they received on the con-

They brought back intangibles.

‘O O O
tinent to the British Federation
of University Women who ar-
ranged for their comfort in all
the cities of their travel. They
also felt that, circulating among
university people in a non-tour-
ist season, they had freer con-
tacts. '

A student who guided them in
East Berlin conﬁned his conversa-
tion to direct translation without
side comment while they visited
the Communist University. The
deans had no chance to talk to
students whom they saw only in
the cafeteria.

According to Miss Rush, the
people of East Berlin appear
downtrodden _ and absorbed into
the Russian way in spite of them-
selves. They spend all their money
on food because the government
conﬁscates any property which
they improve.

Poor Quality Goods

Miss Skewis noticed particu-
larly the few automobiles and
empty streets. She commented on
the store which was once the fore-
most in Berlin. “The goods were
of extremely, poor quality but
represented the best among the
satellites.” She added that coffee,
costing 25 dollars per pound, was

0 O 0
sold in packages weighing one
eighth of a pound and that shoes
are valued at 60 to 100 American
dollars.

Having seen the “Diary of Anne
Frank” previously, they attended
the presentation in West Berlin
primarily to study audience reac-
tions. Miss Rush agrees with the
current reviews which state that
silence is the dominant reaction at
the end of the play.

She asserted, “The atmosphere
seemed charged. We were left
guessing whether the viewers felt
a sense of guilt or were stunned at
knowing the truth.”

In West Berlin they also vis-
ited the free university, the
main building of which was
built with Ford Foundation
money. According to Miss
Skewis, one man there said that
perhaps Communism is good for ~
Germany because it might shake
the people from the militarism
and Fascism which, he claims, is
not dead. »

“We got the same impression
from some students in Heidel-
berg,” he added, “that militarism
still exists. ‘

Both learned that in some places
Fulbright students were not re-

New Year Holiday
At Party of Artists

spected as scholars but were con-
sidered as having gone abroad for
a holiday. Miss Rush was asked
how to evaluate the students, se-
lecting the good from the non-ser-
ious. She had no answer.

Language Diﬁiculty ,
The language barrier caught up
with the travellers in Paris. They
were astounded by the attitude of
the French who refused to try to
understand English or to help
them with their faulty French.
This was a great contrast with
Germany where even the bellhops
were eager to increase their Eng-
lish vocabulary. l
Their hotel in Paris was the
headquarters for the American
press affiliated with NATO. Miss
Skewis said, “We were very proud
of them because they are serious
about their work. They contribute
much to good public relations for
this country.” «
Christmas was spent in Zur-
matt, Switzerland where Miss
Rush was conﬁned with illness.
The decorated tree with its
candles burning in the dining
room added a home touch, how-

New Year’s Eve they were
guests at a private party where all
the other guests were symphony
directors or musicians who had
made their debuts in Paris or
Rome. “We were the only non-ar-
tists present,” laughed Miss Rush.
Symphonies Supported
Miss Skewis met a young Amer-
ican conductor and his wife. He
said that the reason he is staying

WHAT TO WEAR ON THE SATELLITE

SCENE: It is almost zero hour
at Los Bismuth. On stage are
Capt. Carruthers, the man in
charge of the launching of the
satellite, and Manfred Faustus
Sport, the man who will ride
the satellite.

Carr: Well, Sport, this is it. \
Sport: Real gas, Cap. I’m
almost ﬂying already. How
do I look?

Carr: You could wear cat-gut
and lemon-peels, and who
would be the wiser?

Sport: Wake up, Cap. What
about that crowd at Mt. Palo-
mar with that big, spooky
telescope? Got to look spiffy
for them.

Carr: That shirt’s a beaut.
But,‘ where’s the rest of your
luggage?

Sport: Who needs more? This
shirt is a Van Heusen Vantage

 

shirt. It’s one of those all
cotton. drip-dry numbers that
never needs ironing.

Carr: What a discovery! But
how will you wash it up there?
Sport: In the rain, man, in the
rain.

Carr: And how will you dry it?
Sport: In the sun, man, in
the sun.

Carr: Well, it’s zero minus
one. Sport, you’ll be gone for-
ever. (SOUND OF WHOOSH-
ING). He’s gone.
EPILOGUE: The scene is the
observatory at Mt. Palomar.
Scientist: Man, he’s real gone.
Just look at that Van Heusen '
Vantage shirt.

Yes, in outer space, or right
here on terra ﬁrma, no drip-dry
discovery ranks with Van
Heusen Vantage shirts. The
tariff? Only $5.

Editor, The Pitt News,

I have been following Dave
Breaksto_ne’s series of articles on
education and I want to say that
he has done a commendable job.
There is, however, one miscon-
ception, which appeared in the
..Feb. 12_ edition, that requires
clariﬁcation.

Mr. Breakstone stressed the
importance of individual free-'
dom on the part of students in
carrying out a worthwhile ac-
tivities program. He went on to
state that there' are presently
only two activities, one of them
the William Pitt Debating Union,
which have accomplished “top-
"notch work.” .

The implication seems clear:
‘that the William Pitt Debating
Unionis one of the two activities

therefore, is successful. As one
who has been aifiliated with De-
bate /at Pitt for the past four
years, I must disagree with this
implication.

I have never participated in a
student activity which was more
tightly controlled by one man,
Dr. Newman. It is true that there
is an Executive Committee com-
posed/of students, but it is noth-
ing more than a ‘puppet body
serving as Dr. Newm‘an’s veriﬁer
than an independent student
committee.’ '

One illustration should suffice
to prove my contention. At a re-

debate meeting, Dr: Newman

made an on/-the—spot decision,
and I suggested. openly (There
were approximately thirty stu-

dents, present inaddition to Dr.

flexibility.” Dr. Newman .shot
back immediately, “You’re god-
darn right, Jacobs,” andthe mat-
ter was dropped. It was as if
“God” had made a decision, and
it could not be questioned.‘

I expect that one of Dr. New-
man’s fair-haired boys will
answer this letter, taking ex-
treme issue with what I have
said. Unfortunately, space does
not permit me to give other
numerous . illustrations of the
iron-handed method used by Dr.
Newman to rule Debate at Pitt.

This letter is not intended to
deny the success that Pitt de-
baters have achieved in recent
years, but only to call attention
to theyfact that this activity falls
far short of meeting, Mr. Break-

stone’s criteria for a worthwhile,

in Europe is to get experience. “A
city like Heidelberg supports eight
orchestras and ‘Pittsburgh has
trouble supporting one,” he ex-
plained.

Newspapers warned the Roman
citizenry to stay off the streets
New Year’s Eve because it is a
tradition for the people to start
the year by discarding everything
they don’t want. Out of the win-
dows came garbage, glass, and
ﬁrecrackers.

Sailing rhomeward from
Naples they passed through the

Azores where they saw a vol-
cano in action. ‘

The deans expressed the hope ,

that they helped create an impres-
sion in the European mind that all
Americans are not extravagant
and wasteful. That is why travel.-
ling is a good experience for those
on limited budgets, in Miss Rush’s
opinion. .

Miss Skewis added. that they
emphasized their interest in non-
material subjects by not buying
anything to bring home.

Miss Rush hastily added, “We

THE PLEDGE YOU SAVE
MAY BE YOUR OWN

Today’s column is directed at those young female undergradu-
ates who have recently pledged sororities and are worried, poor
lambs, that they won’t make good. Following is a list of simple
instructions which, if faithfully observed, will positively guaran-
tee that you will be a mad success as a sorority girl.

First, let us take up the matter of housemotliers. The house-
mother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You must treat
her with respect. When you wish to speak to her, address her as
“Mother Sigafoos” or “Ma’am.” In no circumstances must you
say, “Hey, fat lady.”

Second, letus discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on the
front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and shows
a want of breeding. Use‘ the Chapter Room. ‘ ’

. Third, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing
meals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your cook
goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu Varied and
nourishing. The least. you can do is show your appreciation.

. Don’t just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with delight,

“What delicious pork jowlsl” or “What a yummy soupbonel’?
or “What scrumptious ﬁsh heads!” or “What clear water!”

Fourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance reflects
not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was well enough
before you joined a sorority to lounge around campus in your
old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now you must take
great pains to dress in a manner which excites admiring com-
ments from all who observe you. A few years ago, for example,
there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk at the Univer-
sity of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her sorors.

‘ //k hfﬂi 1% /}Z.ri/Z/ﬂzzﬁll/$1/‘d/z..,.

Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb to
the class she wasattending. For instance, to English Lit she
wore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and .
carried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 120 yards of ticker
tape. Her shiningest hoiir came one day when she dressed as a
white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi Omega sisters,
but the entire student body went into deep mourning when she,
was killed by the janitor’s cat.

Finally, let us take up the most important topic_of all. I

‘refer, of course, to dating.

As we have scen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority,
but the men you date reﬂect even more. Be absolutely certain
that your date is an acceptable fellow. Don’t beat about the
bush; ask him point-blank, “Are you an acceptable fellow?’f
Unless he replies, “Yeah, hey,” send him‘ packing.

But don’t ju.-it take his word that he is acceptable. Inspect
him closely. Arc his ﬁngernails clean? Is his black leatllier jacket
freshly oiled? Is his ukulele in tune? Does he carry public
liability insurance? And, most signiﬁcant of all, does he smoke
l\lurll>oros? ,

If he’s a Marlboro man, you know he’s a lot of man. You
know he has I.-2t.*~‘ii(} and discerimicnt, wit and wisdom, cliaracter
and sapiencc, decency and warmth, presence and poise, talent
and grit, filter and flavor. You will be proud of him, your sorority
will be proud of him, the makers of Marlboro will be proud of
him, and I will be paid for this column.

This will be the ﬁrst time that

In 1953, the Men’s team made a
tour of South America and were
widely acclaimed. In 1926, a Ger-

visit aimed at providing for
Americans a look at gymnastics

All the gymnasts are amateurs
from various parts of West Ger-

F rosh Enjoy Winning Season;

Coach Carl Peterson is enjoy-
ing one of his most successful sea-
sons as a freshman basketball
mentor this year as his squad
boasts of a 9-1 record to date with
only ﬁve more games remaining
on the schedule.

The ﬁve games remaining are
against teams that the Yearlings
have snowed under earlier this

season. The only loss of the sea-
son came at the hands of Kent
State on.Feb. 1.

Out of a 16 game schedule
last year, the Cubs wound up
with an 8-8 slate to give Coach
Peterson 3. ﬁve year record of
46-17. This year Peterson claims
that the chances are good to
make it an overall 63-18 slate.

In their last game, the Frosh
downed the~Geneva JV team by a

_ 58-54 score through the well*co-

ordinated efforts of Howie Lock-
hart, Darwin Smith, Dick Felin-
ski, J otn Frigley, and Nick Sutyak.

Lockhart and Smith are prod-
ucts of the blue grass state of
Kentucky while the others are
proteges of the Keystone State.
Sutyak, an ou anding baseball
player as well as basketball, has
had numerous bonus offers to play

major league baseball but has re-
fused them all for the security of
a college education.

The squad also boasts of two
football players that have help-
ed the cause with a few blocks
here and there in Mike Ditka.
and Bob Cunningham.

-Before the Yearlings can call it
a season, they will have to mix
it up with Carnegie Tech, West
Virginia, Geneva, Westminster,
and Penn State.

Duquesne was also on the sched-

ule but the tilt may not be play-"“*

With Top Rated Lehigh

Saturday night’s wrestling meet will bring together two
eastern powerhouses in Lehigh and the Panthers. Both teams

will have a good chance to displace last year’s EIWA‘

champs, Penn State, when they clash for the championship
on Mar. 14-15. The action starts at 8 p.m. at the Field House.

Lehigh will present a letterman in each position except
the 157 pound class. Joe Grattoé
(137) will spearhead the En-
gineers attack. Gratto (5-0-1) was
the runnerup to John Pepe in the
Easterns, but won the National by

M defeating Pepe.

Richard Santoro (147) has a
creditable 5-0 record beside ﬁn-
ishing second in the Easterns last
year. Robert Myers (123) and
Leon Harbold (130) will handle
the lighter weights.

Squash Team Finishes Season;
Mason Enters College Tourney

For the second straight year, the Panther Squash team
coached by Ben Pope has come through with a perfect rec-
ord. Only to Coach Pope’s dismay, the record is 0-4 instead
of the much sought after 4-0 slate. ,

The Jungle Cats have been ableito avert a shut—out in

all but one meet through the brilliant effort of Sophomore
Dave Mason. Last year MasonO
was a finalist in the National Jun-
ior Squash Tournament and, Wlll _
this year enter for the ﬁrs’: time
the Inter-collegiate, Tournament
to be held at New Haven, Con-
necticut on March 7.

Mason, surrently participating
in the City “A” tournament, is
seeded fourth in the city. His
only loss this season was at Yale
during the semester break.

During the semester break, the
squad lost to Amhurst, Weslyan,

a shut-out by Yale 5-0.

Although the squash team has
had a losing record these past two
years, Coach Pope has high hopes
for the future. “The sport here
is still quite new and ﬁnally be-
ing recognized by the student
body. This year, we have had
quite a number of new students
trying out for the teamand with
Mason to lean on perhaps we will
have something to show our com-
petitors next year.” commented

My first ﬁfteen months were spent in “on-the-
job” training—changing assignments every three
months or so. These assignments gave me a
broad, over—all background in telephone engi-
neering. And they were accompanied by plenty
of responsibility. They progressed in importance
with my ability to handle them.

What is the attitude of older engineers
and supervisors towarcI\young men?

I’ve found a strong team spirit in the telephone
company. You’re encouraged to contribute your
ideas, and they’re received with an open mind.
Young men and new ideas are regarded as vital
to the continuing growth of the company.

How about opportunities for advancement?

I’d say they depend on the man. Opportunities
to demonstrate your ability come with each new

How does the telephone company
stack up where pay is’ concerned?

Starting salaries are competitive with those of-
fered by most large companies. Raises are based

on merit, with several increases during your first’

two years with the company. What’s more, your
performance is reviewed regularly to make sure
that your pay keeps up with your progress. All
things considered, I think a Bell Telephone career

is second to none in rewards and opportunities.
