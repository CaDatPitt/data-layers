   SG Election Date Set;
Senate Drafting
 New Constitution

By NANCY FUCHS

Student Government President Jerry Hogan declared

Jan. 24 the official date of SG elections in his report at

i Thursday’s meeting. The Election Committee will meet next
week to discuss such proposed changes as having a central

, polling place instead of several voting stations; scattered

"' throughout the University.
1/ The Senate ‘tabled a resolution
to establish an Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld Award for Student Leader-
ship, introduced by Senator Jim
Janis. The award, which would
be given to a senior who has
consistently and continually ex-

hibited outstanding, dynamic,

leadership of quality in the area
of student affairs will be brought
up again in January.
Rules were again suspended to
discuss the proposed Constitution.
 Senator John Ruskay asked Chair-
" man Marcia Bernstein for a de-
cision of the chair on whether or
not a two-thirds vote was re-
quired to pass approval on the
proposed Constitution. Chairman
Bernstein ruled that since the
senate’s action was not an amend-
ing of an old Constitution but
‘A’ approving a new one, only a ma-
jority vote was necessary.

After the meeting -Hogan ex- '

 plained that when the senate has
5?" considered every section of the
‘ proposed Constitution, the whole
document has to be approved by

a two-thirds vote of the senate.
' The preamble, articles one
through three, and half of arti-
cle four were approved by _a ma-
jority of the [senate after changes
were made. The senate approved

Chemical engineering students

The statement was made to ex-

It ‘now reads: “Student Govern-

Despite its criticisms the~ECPD

The senate voted to delete the
statement that an SG president
could not hold an office of major
responsibility in another recog-
nized University organization. It
was felt that an -office in some
organizations such as honoraries
would not make a great demand

on an SG president.

versity’s ﬁnancial dilemma was
thrust upon us all.

out that there are many new or-

altogether there are 150 student’
organizations connected with the‘
University. Participation in stu-

A alums reacted to her stay in
Ghana. The book is To the Peace
Corps’ with Love by Arnold Zeit-.
lin, husband of Marian‘Frank
Zeitliﬁ, a University grad.

The Zeitlins were part of the
ﬁrst contingent of the Peace
Corps, when they were sent to
Ghana in 1961. There Zeitlin
taught English for two years in
the capital city of Accra. ‘He was
‘stationed at the ramshackle
O’Reilly Secondary School and
was its ﬁrst white teacher.

He met his wife in Ghana
where she was also on a Peace
Corps assignment. While at the

writing for Ideas and Figures

and worked brieﬂy for the Uni- ‘

versity Public Relations depart-
ment, during which time she
planned “the dedication cere-

Peace Corps assignment in 1961.
Her father is Dr. Henry Frank,
professor of chemistry and for-
mer chairman of the Department
of Chemistry. '

One of Zeitlin’s main efforts
in the book is to contrast the
reality of life in Ghana against
life there as the Corps would
have pictured it. He felt the

ed, with projecting an image of

Much of his criticism of the

He. explains in the book that
while Ghana is backward in
many areas it is also a ,proud
nation and wanted to'take,care'
of their guests Irom the United
States. Here the Zeitlins ran into
discrimination in reverse. They
never were allowed to wait for
tickets at an event and were al-
waysrushed to the head of the
line. The Ghanaians expected the
white couple to have a car and
were surprised when the Zeit-
lins insisted on riding the “mam-'

Parents’ Weekend

An Overall Success

A $650 proﬁt was made on the Oct. ‘22-23 Parents’
Weekend which was hailed as a “tremendous success in all
aspects” by weekend chairman Dan Katz.

The proﬁt total is $100 lower than it should be because"
of the theft of the University banner which was paid for

out of the weekend’s receipts.

Katz attributed the ﬁnancial

success of the aifairto the $1 in-
cidental expense fee charged to
each of the 1,000 parents who
attended. The weekend was “most
enjoyable to the parents and the
administration from a social
point of view” as a result of the
informal reception on Friday
evening hosted by Vice-Chancel-
lor of Student Affairs Helen P.
Rush, he said.
I “The Saturday morning discus-
sions were well receivedby the
parents,” Katz said. Approximate-
ly 350 to 400 persons attended.
the two forums “A Berkeley at
Pitt? The Revolution in the Ur-
ban» University” and “Changing
Morals ‘on the University Cam-
puses.” .

With the retention of the $1 in-
cidental expense fee and an in-
formal and timely program Katz

predicted future Parents’ Week-
end successes.

Sociologist Speaks Tonight
In Teller Lecture Series

“Poverty Policy and Social Work
Practice” will be discussed by
Dr., Alfred J. Kahn tonight ‘at
8:30 p.m. in the Graduate School
of Public Health Auditorium. Dr.
Kahn is a professor of social Work
at the Columbia University
-School-of Social Work. .

The‘ lecture is the fourth in
the. Sidney A. Teller Lecture
Series, an annual series of free
public lectures delivered\ by
prominent members of the so-
cial work profession.

Dr. Kahn believes that the tra-
ditional consequence of being
poor—the ritual of humilation,
inadequate aid and loss of re-
spectability as soon as one needs
help——belongs to a bygone day.’

He bases his belief oniithe fact
that modern society is able to
produce more goods than ever
before, thus being able to pro-

-vide a , standard of living com-

patible with human -dignity for
all people, regardless of the work
they perform.

Dr. Kahn serves as consultant
to the Citizens Committee for
Children of New York and is

chairman of the Division of Prac-_ 
tice and Knowledge of the Na-
tional Association of Social Work-
ers. He has written a series of
major studies and reports on de-
linquency and community plan-
ning for children in trouble and-
has served as consultant to state
and local agencies.

History Reveals Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto
As Main Japanese Man Behind Pearl Harbor Attack

By RONALD JADKULA

When the bombs fell on Pearl
Harbor, a stocky, gray-haired man
in Japan smiled. His name was
Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, com-
mander of the Japanese Imperial
Navy. _

When he was young, he heard
of barbarians who had come in
their black ships to break down
the doors of Japan, threaten the
Son of Heaven, and trample on
ancient customs. Because of these
stories, he possessed a burning
hatred of all things American.

It was this burning hatred that
prompted him, in January, 1941,
to plan his attack on Pearl Har-
bor. At that time, his navy was
more powerful than the com-
bined allied forces in the Paciﬁc.
It also held numerical air su-
periority. With his country’s new-
ly acquired membership in the
Axis, he“ could see no other out-
‘come but victory.

The Admiral wasn’t a fool. He
realized that America had am-

, ple resources to stage a come-

back after the attack, but he ex-
pected his navy to hem in the
American forces for at least 18
months. During this time, Japan
could developtrade with its con-
quered territories and‘ have the
potential for a long war. This,
plus his belief that the. United
States would get tired of ﬁghting
the war and give up, made him

‘ dream of dictating peace terms
in the White House. ,

By September 13, 1941, his
plan—'-the Combined Fleet Oper-
ation Number One--was com-
pleted. From Oct. 5-Nov. 7, the
striking force was intensively
trained. It consisted of six car-
riers, two battleships, two heavy
cruisers, one light cruiser, 16 de-
stroyers, and 11 supply vessels.‘

On Nov. 24, the attack ﬂeet
ﬁnished . taking on supplies in
Hitokuppu Bay and proceeded in
secret to Hawaii. False radio sig-
nals and phony ship signs were
created by’vessels not in the at-
tack ﬂeet, and United States In-
telligence was led to believe that
all Japanese wafships‘ were still
in Japanese waters.

An Advanced- Expeditionary
Force‘ also left for Hawaii. Its

submarines had the job of recon- -

naissance, transmitting informa-
tion to’ the striking force, and
torpedoing ships that escaped the
attack. ’ I = _ -
—’The main concern of the rank-
ing officers at Pearl Harbor was
the "peril of surprise attack. Ad-
miral Kimmel, commander in
the United States Paciﬁc forces,

ington for trained officers, mod-

cl-ii planes, ooinbs, air torpedoes,
radar, and base defenses.

It is obvious that Pearl Harbor
was under-supplied. When Ad-
miral Kimmel tried to obtain ra-
dar for the island, he was refused
because it was felt that radar
towers would hurt the natural
appearance of the land. After
many arguments, Kimmel got his
radar. He also requested torpedo
nets to protect ships anchored in
' the harbor. When the nets ar-
rived, it was too late.

On Dec. 5, Yamamoto’s attack
ﬂeet, under the command of Vice-
Admiral Chuichi Nagamo, re-
ceived a message consisting of
three words, “Climb Mount Nii-
taka.” It was the order to attack.
On Dec. 7, Nagamo maneuvered
his ﬂeet into position and launch-
ed the ﬁrst of three waves of
planes. /

That morning, Pearl Harbor
was waking "up after a night de-
scribed by United Press corres-
pondent Joe James Custer as

a peaceful morning with a part-

harbor were moored side by side,
and most of the troops were in
their barracks. Atlthe radar sta-
tion on the north side of Oahu
Island, two army privates de-
cided to stay and practice after
the 7 a.m. closing time. At about
7:02, a large blip appeared on
the screen. When they called the
lieutenant commander,‘ he told
them to “Forget about it.” They
watched the screen until, con-
tact was lost in the hills 20 miles
from the base.

At the same time, a midget
submarine was sighted trailing

bor. It was sunk by the destroyer
Ward. After the sinking, the
Ward sent this message to the
base: “We have attacked, ﬁred
upon and dropped depth charges
on submarine operating in defen-
sive sea area.” The message was
received, but it didn’t reach the-

it was too late. ..

Of the ﬁve midget submarines
that attacked Pearl Harbor, not
one returned. A man named Ka-

left living of the ten who went
out in the. midget subs. He ran
aground and swam to shore
where ‘he was found by an Amer-

’ ican soldier. He was our ﬁrst Jap-

“Pretty damn drunk out.” It was ,

ly cloudy sky. The ships in the.

hands of Admiral Kimmel uritilg

zou Sakamaki was the only one ’

anese prisoner of war.

In the harbor, the morning
stillness was broken by the ﬁrst
‘wave of planes from Yamamoto’s
attack ﬂeet. It was made up of
I83 dive bombers and torpedo
planes. They destroyed the air-
ﬁelds, wrecked supply dumps,
and attacked the ships in the
harbor. Bombs and torpedoes hit
their targets simultaneously. The
ﬁfth column on the island set to
work causing roadblocks on ’the
narrow road leading into the
base.

The seven battleships in the
harbor were badly damaged. The
Nevada was beached. The Okla-
homa was capsized. The Arizona
and California were sunk. The
Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and
West Virginia werelburning
wrecks. Of 92 ships in the harbor,
only one escaped injury.

Many acts of heroism took
place during the attack. When a
heavy bomb exploded the for-
ward magazine of the Arizona,
the terriﬁc shock wave blew the
captain of a nearby ship over-
board. After hitting the water,
he swam back to his ship and
continued to command his men.

Air Force‘ Lieutenant James
W. Robb grabbed a riﬂe, jumped
into a seaplane, and went look-
ing for Japanese. After ﬂying
nearly 100 miles, he ﬁnally real-
ized the futility of his action.,His
only explanation was, “I got
mad.”

Lieutenant George R. Bickell

was eating breakfast when a Jap- '
anese plane crashed in his back;

yard. He drove ten miles with
his wife and child to the nearest
airﬁeld amid straﬁing from at-
tacking planes. 1 He grabbed a

plane and flew into ‘a formation -

of J a p a n e s e planes, shooting

down two of them. Then herwent --
back to the airﬁeld for‘more 1

fuel. When he took off, he was
shot down 200 yards off shore.
This didn’t stop him. He ‘swam
to shore, got another plane, and
went up again‘ to shoot down two
more planes before the attack
was over. The heroism of these
threeﬁmen characterized the de-
fense _.of Pearl Harbor.
Thedamage {done to the Paciﬁc
Fleet was tremendous.‘ Yamamo-
to had succeeded in ‘transform-
ing his target into a virtual hell.
Nineteen Ships costing hundreds”
of millions ‘of dollars were sunk.

Twenty.ﬁve million dollars worth
of planes and the same amount
of ammunition, buildings, and
supplies were destroyed. Over 4,-
000 unsuspecting men were left
dead or wounded under the
clouds of smoke and debree visi-
ble to the attacking planes. The
Japanese rejoiced at their vic-
tory, and Admiral Yamamoto was
their hero.

But there is an old saying that
“heros don’t live long,” and such
was the case with Admiral Ya-
mamoto. In April, 1943,‘ almost 17
months after the attack, the Ad-
miral was ﬂying over the Solo-
mon Islands on an inspection
tour of the Imperial Navy. Two
bombers carried Yamamoto and
his entire staff while six ﬁghters

provided cover. Suddenly they 0

spotted two American planes in
the distance. The six ﬁghters
peeled off to attack whﬂe the
two bombers carrying the Ad-
miral and his staff headed inland

Solomon Islands’ jungle. Mean-
while, the two American planes
evaded the Japanese ﬁghters and
closed in on the bombers for the
kill. Minutes later, both bombers
fell into the jungle to crash in
ﬂames under the guns and can-
non of the American ﬁghters. On
that day, Admiral Yamamoto paid
for the attack on Pearl Harbor
with his life. '

Complaints have been made during the past two weeks about faculty
members violating the pre-ﬁnals reading period scheduled for next Monday
and Tuesday. Most objections are to teachers who are holding classes dur-

‘j ing the reading period, giving tests during the reading period, or’ giving
’ ﬁnals in that period.

Dr. W. George Crouch, secretary of the University, has issued astate-

V' ment that “all faculty teaching undergraduate courses are requested not
.to schedule examinations or regular class work” on the reading days (see

 story, page 1-)-

.-

While Crouch’s statement should be followed, there must be recogni-

' tion of one justiﬁable exception. There are instances where classes have
7 agreed by consensus to have the ﬁnal examination before or during the
'1' reading period. C

There are some courses where there is no cumulative ﬁnal, but rather
three or four tests of equal credit covering specific areas of course work.
If students in a class agree to take such tests before or during the reading
period, the teacher should honor this request.

This is the ﬁrst trimester for such a reading period and the confusion

occuring should receive some tolerance. Teachers, however, should not
i use their personal desires to leave school early as a justiﬁcation for violat- ,

  Study Period For   Study  

Students and faculty both should have been aware of the reading
period policy at the beginning of the trimester. All departments were noti-
ﬁed and the information was made available to students.

We heartily urged that any student who feels the reading period is
being violated for personal or reasonably unjustifiable causes contact Dr.
Crouch. Such recourse should not be taken merely as a random opportunity
to attack the faculty or administration, but should‘ be taken as a channel
to air legitimate arguments.

\

The purpose of the reading period is to provide time for students to

_ absorb and study in-depth all the material for a course. With‘ the tight

schedule of a trimester system, such a period is needed to gain full insight
into-course work and acquire a comprehensive understanding.

By providing such an opportunity, students Qould be justifiably tested
on an entire trimester’s work in a course. A comprehensive, cumulative
ﬁnal would be fairer. I, , ’

In a trimester, time is precious. Many students have planned -their
studies around the idea of having the reading period. If the reading period
is to continue,» and indeed it should, it should be solely for reading and
study; not testing and classes. Some tolerance is necessary this ﬁrst time,

Tuck Shop Formula Uncovered

An undercover agent has
obtained the precious secret
formula for Tuck‘ Shop (TS)
Coffee. Terrence Leadbelly,
secret agent O00, turned in
the formula to the Pitts-
burgh branch of the Food

and Drug Administration to- T

day. \

“The waitresses guarded
the formula with their lives,”
said Leadbelly, “but I caught
them off-guard while they
were ﬁlling the napkin boxes’
and straw bins one day.”

Leadbelly described the
process of making the fabled
brew. .“About one-half hour
before opening time, the two
oldest employees are sent to
the kitchen,” he said. "They
are given all the water they
need, ﬂavoring, artiﬁcial col-
oring and one can of surplus
coffee.”

2 Letters To The Editor

Praise, Criticism

__ A Given Movie Review
(Editor, The Pitt News:

Bill Jerome’s review/psycho-

ii analytical study of The Pawn-
broker (Nov. 24 issue of The Pitt
News) was a very ﬁne one:‘in-

telligent, penetrating; thought-

 provoking. Mr. Jerome recognized
'. the great signiﬁcance of this ﬁlm
V and has stated "his views clearly
and concisely.

As 'a cinema buff, I found only

"two minor points on which Mr.
' Jerome was a bit cloudy. He neg-
.- lected to mention Sidney Lumet,
I-the director, in his review. This
 is akin to describing the merits
 of the champion harness horse
I Bret Hanover without- putting in

a word for ‘his trainer-driver

J Frank Ervin.
 . Mr. Lumet is a great talent and
,jhis work on this beautiful ﬁlm

deserved a sentence or two. Most
of the nation's critics have de.
voted thousands of words to Lu-
met’s brilliant technique" in The

' Pawnbroker.

My other criticism of Mr. J er-

_.ome’s criticism stems from his

labeling The Pawnbroker a Hol-

, lywood movie. It is hardly that.
: This would constitute an “in-

s,u1t”rto Mr. Lumet. This ﬁlm is

g a creation of the New York ’
_‘ “school” of ﬁlm-making-, if I may
I use such a term, and all of the

creators,have theireroots in New

York theatre and television.

Mr. Jerome’s premise is well-
taken—important ﬁlms and the
product of the Hollywood ﬁlm
factories rarely coincide. In speak-
ing of a ﬁlm by Lumet, critics
never equate his work with “a
Hollywood movie.” Surely, some
of his previous ﬁlm—Twelve An-
gry Men, A View from the Bride,
Long Da_y’s Journey into Night-
could never be thought of as
“Hollywood movies.” _

Aside from these minor points,
I tip my hat to Mr. Jerome for
a well-written and stimulating
review of The Pawnbroker.

Letter Requests
Saga Clean - Up
Editor, The Pitt News: A

We ‘certainly feel that a com-
plaint is warranted concerning
the outright “piggishness" of
many people using the Tower’s
cafeteria. Often students are un-
able to ﬁnd seats because so
many persons leave their trays
on the tables stacked high with
used dishes.

»

There is no excuse, for such
downright inconsideration. Per-
haps Saga could once again put
up “reminder” signs or have per-
iodic tray collection (those that
are left) before 6:30. In reality,
however, nothing will help un-
less people realize that their ac-
tions are neither funny nor clev-
er; they are playing a childish
trick on many people who do
not need the aggravation.

coffee within a half hour. If
they fail, they are assigned
to cooking hot dogs for the
next two weeks,” Leadbelly
said. ,

Leadbelly began his assign-
ment at the beginning of the
fall’trimester under the aus-
pices of the.Graduate School

of Public Health (GSPH).-

He was chosen because of
his ﬁne record in the school’s
ptomain testing experiments.

“Leadbe11y had previously -

received the purple stomach,
our award for service above
and beyond the call of duty,”
said Dr.’ Lots 0. Gutts, head
of the school’s espionage?
corps. “We ﬁgured Leadbelly
was the only man with

enough ‘stomach lining to

withstand the three month
testing of Tuck Shop coffee.”

REPORTS are now being
submitted by the GSPH for
review by the Food and Drug
authorities. Leadbelly will
begin six weeks of exhaus-
tive medical tests next week
followed by a written ac-
count of his work.

Leadbelly revealed some
of the personal aspects of his
experiments in a closed ses-
sion before the Board of
Tnustees. “Several cold morn-
ings I entered the Cathedral,
my hands shaking and hav-
ing chills all over,” he said.
“Then came the test, would
the TS coffee warm my in-
sides? ‘

“In 99 and 44/100 per cent
of the cases‘the answer was
NO. Once the taste of the
coffee became so unbearable,

I. was almost tempted to go.
to the University - Health"

Service.”

eating way the styrofoam
cups. ~ .

“I sat down one morning
to sip the brew and I sud-
denly realized the cup was
leaking from four different
places,” Leadbelly said. “I

"took it to the cashierwho

told me it was a;weakness in
the cups. She gave me a sup-
ply of napkins and recom-
mended I start drinking
cokes.” '

After hearing excerpts of
the report, the Board mem-
bers gave sighs of anguish
and disgust.‘ “It’s a disgrace
to our University‘ and may
hinder our chances for a
grant from the Ford Founda-
tion,” said Chairman’GWi1ym
Price. . .

“PERHAPS we should au-
tomate the entire area to
conform to the rest of our
University,” Price continued.
“After all it will eliminate
some of the human element

Leadbe1lybattledPrice’s rec-
ommendations urging better’
health procedures instead of
wild-eyed idealitic schemes.
After thorough discussion,
the Board decided to put the

{issue into committee until

Leadbelly’s examination was
completed. ’ ’

Dr. Gutts feels there, will
be no federal action until ,.

qualitative analysis is run on"

the sample Tuck Shop coffee.
Gutts foresees a law requir-
ing the Tuck Shop to place a
health warning on each glass
of coffee.

Seminars in Europe

Twelve groups, each composed 20-30 selected American

college students, will form seminars in various European

cities next summer to study the language, culture, and civil-

ization of these countries during a nine-week stay.
Designed for the serious student who does not plan to

see all of Europe in a short summer, Classroom Abroad tries

to give him a more profound ex-
perience through a summer of liv-
ing in Berlin, or Tubingen, Ger-
many; Vienna or Baden, Aus-.
tria; Vichy, Grenoble, or. Rouen,
France; Neuchatel, Switzerland;
Madrid or Santander, Spain; and
Florence, Italy.

Graded classes in small sec-
tions of six to ten students, each
under the supervision of Ameri-
can and native professors, will
deal with the reading of classi-
cal and modern texts, the daily
press, contemporary problems,._
conversation and composition,
pronunciation and grammar. Stu-
dents will also hear lectures on
history and literature and meet
with outstanding personalities.
They will have full auditing priv-
ileges at the university and in all
academic and social activities
with students.

E The scoringopportunities were
 many. In fact, the hoopsters took
80 shots at the basket during the
contest. They could only manage

to-make 28 of them.

i‘ ' “It was our consistent inability
to score,” said coach Bob Tim-
Vmons, “that lost us the game.
Kent State, with their gambling
 defense, gave us a lot of shots.
We just couldn’t hit, even the
wide open ones.” '
 Pete Smith was the main offen-
;_der. The Panther guard shot
three for 16 from the ﬂoor. Roth
2McNally, who sometimes spelled

 make matters worse, the other

Ken Bollenslat the other for-
ward was four of nine “for the
game which was a considerable
improvement over the Carnegie
Tech opener. “Bollens is starting
to become adjusted to the varsi-
ty,” explained Tirnmons. “He’s
looser, more conﬁdent shooter
now.”

The Panthers were in the game
until Lovett fouled. out with
about ﬁve minutes to go. At one
point, late in the second half, the
Kent State. lead was reduced td
49-48." Then, according to Tim-
mons, the hoopsters lacked the
poise needed to go into the lead.

“We went about two minutes
without a basket,” he said. “No-

body could hit when we needed
the clutch shot. Then after Lov-

ett fouled out, Kent State took
advantage of our pressing de-
fense to run up the score.

Actually Lovett’s substitute,
Bob Thompson, provided Tim-
mons with some hope about the
ability of the Panther bench.
Thompson hauled in 12 rebounds
while playing in only certain
spots. ‘

“Thompson is coming along
very well for us,” Timmons said.
“Both he and Bollens need only
the experience and the conﬁ-
dence to start to jell.” Bollens,
incidentally, pulled in .11 re-
bounds.

“Kent State,” added Timmons, A

“has eight seniors on their squad.
They had the poise and timing
that we didn’t, and that was the
difference in the ball game. If
our shooting had been just aver-
age we would have won.

Nick Generalovich, a spare for-
ward, may have broken his hand
at Kent State. “He banked it
against the backboard. They’ll
take X—rays today, and it prob-
ably is broken,” Timmons said.

Stumble On High
Bar, Side Horse

By ROY JACOBS

Trouble on the high bar
and the side horse cost the
gymnastics squad a victory
Saturday night as it dropped a
narrow 153.75-145.45 decision to
the University of Massachusetts.

“It was a good meet and was
close going into the high bar, but
a couple of our men fell down
there,” said coach Warren Nei-
ger following the defeat. Bob
Davies missed on his best trick;
Jim Sacco did not have “one of
his best nights,” and Al Leonhard
was also off form.

“The three we have are es-
sentially good men. They are cap-
able of much better,” added Nei-
ger. Massachusetts also took the
ﬁrst two places in the side horse.

The coach was especially
pleased with the performances of
captain Dave McKinnis and soph-
omore Dave Shidemantle. McKin-
nis took two ﬁrsts-—in the ﬂoor
exercise (8.75 of 10.00) and on
the rings (8.70). Shidemantle,
who has “good potential for the
all-around” according to Neiger,
placed ﬁrst in the long horse, or
vaulting (9.25), second in the
ﬂoor exercises, and third on the
trampoline.

“Massachusetts had no real
high scores. Their vaulting scores
are the highest. A1 Cohen, whose
9.20 placed second, posted their
highest score.”

Michigan State Wins Ocver
Grady’s Swimmers, 90-33

Against Michigan State,
the swimming team hit
rough waters. It went that
way throughout the after-
noon last Saturday at Trees
Pool as Coach Ben Grady’s
regulars ﬁnished last to the score
of 90-33.

Even before the tankmen had
time to break waves on Trees’
shimmering glass-like depths, the
Spartans spurted into a four
point lead with a ﬁrst place ﬁn-
ish in the 440 Medley Relay.
Then to drown any hopes of vic-
tory the swimmers or the large
crowd might have had, MSU’s
Dennis Hill and Dan Panghorn
ended one-two in the 880 Free
Style. Hill won by two lengths
over third placer Lew O’Rei1ly,
stretching the Spartan lead to
16-5.

Co-captain Don Hahnfeldt pro-
vided the only first for the swim-
ming team. He won the low board
diving event. In the high board
contest, Spartan Ken Genova
edged him by 1.3 points, killing
any chances Hahnfeldt had of
sweeping the diving show.

Pete Williams, a sophomore and
the most valuable swimmer on
MSU’s 1964-65 freshmen team,
turned in the only double win of
the day. He ﬁnished 17 seconds
ahead of the tankmen’s Russ
Lindberg in the 220 Individual
Medley and 15 seconds again
ahead of Lindberg in the 220
