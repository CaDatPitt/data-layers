Students
cope with
silent
diseases

if Amelia Brause is your everyday
college student. She might be seen
with a backpack, workout clothes

with»“PITT” across her‘ T-shirt A I

and a glowing smile on her face.
She also just won a Board position
on Pitt’s undergraduate Student
Government Board andis involved
with Relay for Life. She looks
healthy from the outside and goes
_to classes like any other student on
campus. But what people can’t see
when ﬁrst approaching Brause is
that she has a silent disease.

Amelia Brause has Crohn’s dis—.
ease_.

Crohn’s is an inflammatory
bowel disorder that causes inﬂam-
mation or ulceration of the diges-
tive tract. In Brause’s terms, “It’s all
the perks of having a bad stomach
ﬂu along with some more serious
complications, such as joint prob-
lems, loss of energy, mouth sores.”

For the junior neuroscience ma-
jor, those complications started
when she was 9 years old, and her
weight loss and fatigue and have
not stopped even today. Inﬂam-
mation is also induced by stress.
She receives a powerful IV infusion
of the medication Tysabri once a
month, risking irreversible de-
mentia asa possible sidefeffect.

But when Brause missed an
organic chemistry exam for an
emergency week-long hospitaliza-
tion last March, her disease wasn’t
enough for her professor to grant

Conflict between the Israeli De-
fense Force and Hamas, the_domi—
nant political party on the Gaza
Strip, ﬂared up once again earlier
this month, causing many people
worldwide — including current and
past Pitt afﬁliates —- to choose sides.’

For very different reasons, both
Pitt graduateMicah Toll and English
professorKennethBoas wereinlsrael
when the events of the recent eight
days of heightened conflict,’ which-
ended only last Thursday, unfolded. A

Toll now lives in the country as and
Israeli citizen. Boas spent two weeks

to sites in Palestinian territory on the
West Bank and returned to the US.
last Friday. The two men’s opinions
on the conﬂict were as different as

their reasons for being near it.

_ During the conflict, Hamas ﬁred
medium—range missiles at major
Israeli cities, including the capital,
Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, the Israeli De-
fense Force carried out air opera-
tions against Gaza, at times amassing
ground forces near the border. The
conflict ended with the signing of a
cease-ﬁre agreement brokered by
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.

Accordingto aHamas website, the

' organization counted 176 Palestinian

dead and almost 1,400 wounded as
ofwednesday afternoon, aﬁgure that
included at least one Palestinian who
died from his wounds after the cease-
ﬁre took effect. . ’
As ofthe cease-ﬁre on-Nov.‘ 21,

the .IDF counted ﬁve Israelis dead '

and 240 wounded, according to an
ofﬁcial website.’ ,
Toll, who graduated from Pitt last

I‘

   

year with a degree in engineering,
has livedvin Tel Aviv for the last three
months. He is now an Israeli citizen,
and he plans to enter the Israeli army
next April, both out of patriotism
and to ﬁilﬁll a requirement for 18-
to 24—year—olds who immigrate into
the country. . P

Speaking Nov. 21, the same day
on which a terrorist attack against a
bus wounded several dozen civilians,
Toll described the mood in Tel Aviv
as “tense.” Several times, he said, he
had been near enough to the sight of
arocket’s impact to hear its explosion
and experience the ground shaking
before air—raid sirens blared.

“Whenever air—raid sirensgo off,

ries from the Second Intifada,” Toll

said, referring to a period of height-
ened violence in the early 2000s.

During the Second Intifada, Toll
said, sirens usually indicated a suicide

Boas, a lecturer in Pitt’s English
department, returned to the U.S.
last Friday from a tour of Israel that
includedvisits tojerusalem and Naza-
reth as well as to Hebron, Ramallah
andjericho alongwith other locations
in the largely Palestinian West Bank.

During the tour —-— which he paid

to visit sites in Gaza because of the
outbreak of violence.

Despite the disconnect she’s felt from
the center, Brause said most of the other
professors sl_1e’s had are accommodating,
including neuroscience professor Edward
Stricker.

“You create ways to accommodate,”
Stricker said., “I don’t think there’s anything
I do that’s reinarkable.” Z

Stricker said he’s accommodated stu-
dents for all kinds of reasons, such as panic

‘ disorders or even for those who are easily
distracted.’ But he says he was not trained or

instructed in how. to deal with these silent

medical issues.
“I don’t know anything about the disabil-

Boas spoke on what he maintained were the
underlying causes that create ﬁghting through
the alienation of the Palestinians. ,

“You cannot remove the [Israeli] occupation
from the equation when you talk about any of
these individual events,” Boas said, referring
to the eight—day conﬂict.

As a case in point, he cited the widespread
security checkpoints that he believe restrict
the movement of Palestinians and Israeli Ar-
abs alike.

He also pointed to the presence of Israeli
settlements, including one in Hebron, as evi-
dence of Israel’s intent to take territory from
Palestinians. He said that in many parts of
Israel, Jewish—only roads and streets restrict
Palestinian Arabs’ movement. _

He said that much of what is reported often
minimizes the suffering of the Palestinians,
which contributes to the political support that
Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist
group by the United States, Israel and other
governments, enjoys within the Gaza Strip.

Boas" said he believes Palestinians in Gaza
favor Hamas because they see it as serving
their interests more than its rival party, Fatah,
known in English as the Palestinian Liberation
Organization. Boas said Fatah has a reputation
for corruption. ‘ ‘

“Hamas, for all of its extremism, which I
do not approve of and do not agree with, is not
corrupt,” Boas said.

He explained that in addition to building
schools and clinics and rebuilding houses,
Hamas provides jobs and a social service net-
works in the Gaza Strip. Without Hamas, such
a means of social support would not exist.

Boas also believed that Hamas’ militant ac-

tions, including the missiles it ﬁred during the I

eight-day conﬂict, resulted from Israeli provo-
cations. Boas added that he believedthat Israel
instigates conﬂict in order to avoid looking like
the aggressor.

Toll, however, disagreed, saying that Israel
employed force only to protect itselfand that it
seeks to minimize civilian casualties, whereas
Hamas deliberately targets noncombatants.

Toll cited measures such as mass text mes-
sages to Palestinians, warnings to civilians in

- certain areas broadcast over Palestinian radio

and leaﬂets dropped fromplanes that he said
the IDF uses in its operations prior to any air
strikes. My

Toll said that while opinions varied widely,
he and many other Israelis did not want to see
a ground invasion of Gaza —— which appeared

possible during the conﬂict —— saying that such .

a measure would cause increased bloodshed '

on both sides. - V ~
Ross Harrison, a faculty member in Pitt’s

political science department and a professor"

at Georgetown who lectureson Middle Eastern
history and affairs, pointed to the IDF’s targeted

killing on Nov. 14 of the late Hamas Minister of 

Defense Ahmed al-]abari— conﬁrmed through
IDF’s official announcements — as the catalyst
that set off the wave of Violence.‘ ‘
Harrison described al-Jabari as a '
strategist who contributed to Hamas’ weap

ons capabilities including missiles with ranges
I longer than those the group had previously
been known to use. Though unsure ofhow long
Hamas had been developing the missiles, he
said that with al-Jabari’s killing, the revelation
came to surviving Hamas leaders that Israel’s
intelligence services knew of their capabilities.
Harrison called the ensuing events a “death
spir ” between Israel and Hamas as the latter
began to ﬁre off missiles into Israeli territory.
In retaliation, Israel considered the possibility
of a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip while
carrying out airstrikes against targets there.
Harrison explained the large discrepancy
between Israeli and Palestinian casualties by cit-
ing Israel’s Iron Dome program, an air—defense
system designedto intercept rockets.

   

Though the program is effective, it is also
expensive, Harrison explained, costing about
$55,000 for every rocket it intercepts. The IDF
uses the measure calculatedly to protect resi-
dential areas.

In the end, the negotiations in Cairo for a
cease~ﬁre succeeded. Harrison said that the
Egyptian government was a “natural ally” of
Hamas, which originated as an offshoot of the
Muslim Brotherhood. In the elections that fol-
lowed after Hosni Mubarak stepped downfrom
power, the Islamist party took control in Egypt.

He expected that the new Egyptian govern-
mentwill show more sympathy for Hamas than
Mubarak’s administration, which historically
tended to keep the crossing at its border with
the Gaza Strip closed at Israel’s behest.

Harrison expected that Hamas would con-
tinue to ally itselfwith Egypt while seeking to
distance itselffrom Iran and Syria, two regimes
that have sponsored the Islamist party in the
past. ' ‘ A 

However, Harrison wondered whether an
end in violence was actually in sight. Neither
side, he explained, seemed to think strategically,
instead merely reacting militarily to the other.

While turningisrael into two states  a
Palestinian and anlsraeli — has been proposed
in the pastas a solution, Harrison doubted that
the rift between Fatah and Hamas would even
allow such a course.

“The question out there right nowiswhether
the two—state solution is even viable at the mo-
ment,” he said. I

  OPINIONS    

Organ donation important to  
consider, even for college students

Rosie McKinley
Columnist c

Thousands of deer through-
out the state will be shot in the
upcoming weeks. For the first
time this hunting season, some
of those Pennsylvania bucks and
bambies might be bagged with
bullets holding human. remains.
All thanks to two creative Ala-
bama entrepreneurs. V

There are a lot of unique —
some might say crazy — ways to
dispose of your remains. Holy
Smoke LLC’s idea of encapsulat-
ing cremated ashes into bullets
is just the newest in a long list of
inventive ideas that have people
thinking outside the traditional

’ casket.

Pirates fans who don’t live
to see Pittsburgh enjoy another
World Series — and let’s face
it, that very well could be all of
us — can be buried in a casket
that bears the official team logo.

Across the pond, equally avid

British football fans can spread
their ashes at a number of pre-
mier soccer stadiums. Some tat-
too artists will mix ashes with
ink for a lasting form of memo-
rial. Nothing like getting mom’s
name etched on your bicep with
her ashes! For $12,500, one
company will even launch your
ashes into orbit, guaranteeing
that at least your remains will
make it to the heavens.

Clearly we have a lot of
choices about what to do with
our bodies after we die. One of

them is simple: Save someone

else’s life when you lose yours.
Become an organ donor. _ ‘
Last year, 14,145 American
organ donors contributed a to-
tal of more than 28,000 trans-
plants. Nevertheless, nearly
7,000 patients died in 2011
while waiting for atransplant.
On an averageday like today,
someone in need of a transplant

will die every 18 minutes some-
where in the U.S.

But the story of death and do-
nation is not solely about the
numbers.

,The fact is that as college
students, we do not often con-
template our eventual deaths.
The thoughtof merely pushing
up daisies after graduation —
essentially making useless that
degree we paid thousands of
dollars to get -—.is simply de-
pressing. Moreover, constantly
fearing death would be counter-
productive; it is impossible to
live in the moment if we are con-
tinually looking over our‘ shoul-
ders to see if the Grim Reaper is
right behind us. -

Yet in this YOLO world of
unhealthy habits and hasty
decisions, being occasionally
aware of death is responsible.

Survivors conference shows progress
is needed in suicide prevention

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

At the Survivors of Suicide
Conference held in Pittsburgh,

.I listened to a mother describe

the experience of ﬁnding her
son’s body hanging in her laun-

' dry room._Another couple found
A its 15-year-old daughter dead in

their family home and hasn’t
been able to return since. One
woman went 19 years before‘ she
was able to admit to people who
asked that her late husband had
actually shot himself.

On Saturday, Nov. 17, I sat
in a nursing school building at
Duquesne University, drank very

A bad coffee and listened to fami-

lies debate the ethics of what to
tell a 7-year-old whose parent
has committed suicide. Those
involved discussed whether con-
structing a theory about why a
loved one took herown life is

potentially helpful or if it should
be avoided at all costs.

I Some people had outbursts
during the psychiatrist’s Pow-
erPoint presentation. Some had
to leave the room to compose
themselves. Strangers cried in
each others’ arms. This was an
educational conference, not a
group therapy ‘session, but many
attendees 4 some of whom had
lost their loved ones only months
before — had nevenattended
therapy to help them cope with
their loss or met another suicide-'
loss survivor in a therapeutic
context. ~ '

One attendee had learned
about the Survivors of Suicide

group because a particularly.
‘well-educated funeral director i

gave her a leaﬂet. Most others
found resources on the Internet.
All spoke to feeling cheated and
let down by the lack of informa-
tion about suicide, bereavement

and survivors’ resources offered
to them after the tragedy.

. As a culture, we are not good
at talking about suicide. In ﬁc-
tion, suicide is often romanti-
cized or employed as a shortcut
tragic ending for characters who
‘break the rules-— see Madame
Bovary, Anna Karenina and other
famous cheating wives through-
out literature. In the news, ‘it’s
often described as “senseless”
—- or, on the, ﬂip side, chalked
up to one simple cause like, “he
lost his job.” I

I have never lost a loved one
to suicide. But during my worst
times, before I sought help
for my depression, I did think
about killing myself. so when I
listened to the words of those
who were bereaved by a friend
or family member’s suicide, what
I found truly shocking was how

they echoed the words and experiences

of those who have considered suicide

themselves. — ' «
The brave men and women attendin

the conference said things like, “I felt so .

alone. I thought I was the only one going
through this.” They sp_oke to not knowing

j that resources existed to help them cope_
or to having difﬁculty accessing resources ' I
because of distance or money. They spoke ,

of a deep, paralyzing shame that prevent-
ed them from seeking help. And when
confronted with the raw facts —- more

-than 90 percent of people who commit ’
suicide have a diagnosable mental disor-

der or substance abuse problem, accord-
ing to Johns Hopkins Medicine —— they

expressed tremendous grief knowing that.

what they went through, or what they’re
currently going through, was preventable

with appropriate mental health treatment. 7
And so our cultu're’s devotionto the .

stigmasand myths surrounding suicide

. and mental illness inﬂicts double harm.

Stigma casts a shadow over those who are
suffering from mental illness as well as
those whohave lost someone to it. When
we can’t talk about suicide without shame
and secrecy, it not only increases the pain
of suicide-loss survivors, but confounds
suicide prevention efforts so that. there
will continue to be more suicide-loss ‘
survivors, -. - V .

And that shame is--po'werful. I’ve been
writing about my mental illness" for more
than a year with The Pitt News, but I’ve
never mentionedin these pages that I
was once suicidal because I didn’t want
to risk upsetting my loved ones or per-
haps because I feared exaggerating my
problem. I was never what mental health
experts would have considered high-risk
forsuicide. Instead, I had what would
be described as suicidal ideation-— a.
constant and unshakable preoccupation

with suicide and death, absent any plan

or genuineintention of killing myself. I

had dozens of things inhibiting me from H

killing myself: Who would explain my

death to my special-needs sister? How -

would I prevent someone ‘I loved from

“Silver Linings Playbook”

Director: David 0. Russell

Starring: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Law-

Grade: A+

Overshadowed by the newestjames Bond
ﬁlm and the lastlsegment of the “Twi-
light” series, “Silver Linings Playbook”
didn’t gain much publicity because of its
similar release date. Its premiere hasn’t
garnered much attention compared to
the hype of other recent ﬁlms, giving it
a quiet release.

But even with its lack of popularity
and publicity, “Silver Linings Playbook”
deserves as much attention and applause
as large franchise features because of the
many great components that add incred-
ible value to the sensational film.

This wonderfully surprising ﬁlm fea-
tureslan all-star cast. Bradley Cooper,
Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro
take the screen to dazzle audiences. The
ﬁlm’s humor was lively but not overbear-
ing, and the subtlety of the character
growth and relationships blended to
make an impressive ﬁlm.

“When You Wake Up Feeling Old” by
Wilco ~

start getting used to the idea that I was in
college. This was the place where I lived,
and it all became real. I felt old, and I
looked back on my high school years with
nostalgia, wishing I could relive a lot of
those moments.

But then I askedmyself the same ques-
tion this song asks: “Can you be where you
want to be?” And I was. Iwas exactly where
I wanted to be. Every time we take a big
step in our lives, it takes awhile for us to
realize the meaning of that step. When we
ﬁnally get to college, it can be shocking,
but it is all about making sure you are at a
place that feels like home.

“Anna Sun” by Walk the Moon

With a catchy chorus of “We got no mon-

' ey, but we got heart,” this song might be

a nostalgic look at past college memories
— something we, as freshmen, do not yet
have many of. But the meaning behind the
song makes the next four years something
to look forward to and something to build.

Walk the Moon wrote this song about a
teacher at Kenyon College, Anna Sun; While
we will not all end up writing songs about
our English professors, we will remember
these people that madea difference. When
the exams, essays and work take over, this
song reminds us of the four years ahead
of us. '

“Ooh La La” by The Faces

The realization that We do not know

much and might not know anything at
all hits us hard in these first few monthsqy
People told us that it was going to be hard,
and they told us what to expect, but like
the snotty, rebellious high school seniors
we were, we chose not to listen.

A lot of this song is about heartbreak
and past relationships, but it is also abotgﬁ
remembering where you are from, the mis-
takes you have made and the lessons that
came from them. The freedom that comes
with being a college student can be over-
whelming, and some of us will make the
wrong choices. Luckily, wehave more than
enough time to learn and grow.

“You Can Make Him Like You” by The
Hold Steady

The lead singer of The Hold Steady once
said that this was the most romantic song
he’d ever written, and in most ways, it is.
This cautionary tale of a girl who become_._s 4
so swept up in her relationships that she"
forgets herself reminds us that this type of
situation can, and probably will, happen to
us at some point. It might take more than
just freshman year to occur, or it might
have happened a few times already.

The romanticism in this song primarily
pertains to the way in which relationships
come and go, but we have time in between
those relationships to ﬁgure ourselves out.

vent debate in the U.S. as to whether or
(‘Rot Nazi Germany should hold the 11th
Olympiad. ,

“The ﬁrst part of the exhibit‘ is about
the debate  about whether the [Olym—
pic] events should even happen. There
was a very heated discussion and vote

 the athletic union that governed the
event,” said Peter Black, a historian from
the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. , O

Ultimately, by “a very close number,”
the committee voted that the events
should be held in Germany, one cited
reason being that there was a certain
hypocrisy in the United States protest-
ing racism when it, too, was plagued by
it, Babcock explained. V

But even during a time when Nazi Ger-
many supported white supremacy and the

wridea of the Aryan race, certain victories
tested these forces during the games. The
successes of American Olympian Jesse
Owens, an African—American who won
four gold medals in the Berlin Olympics,
proved to be one such victory against the
Nazi regime in Germany.

This idea of Aryan supremacy and the
importance of athletics in Germany is
epitomized in the propaganda of the time.
“German sports imagery of the 1930s pro-
moted the myth of ‘Aryan’ racial superior-
ity and‘ physical power. Artists idealized

The fates on the football field have been
against Pitt linebacker Dan Mason. No
other Panther has gone through the
injuries that he has, — all of them have
been serious —— and no other Panther

’-'lras surmounted injuries of this magni-
tude so well.

The latest setback occurred in October
when Mason suffered a lacerated liver in
Pitt’s 44-17 Victory over Temple, causing
the Panthers’ linebacker’s up—and~down

Fgareer to take another dip.

The laceration was preceded by his
more well-known injury.

, In the third game of his sophomore
year, Mason suffered a catastrophic blow
to his right knee that doctors initially
said would prevent him from ever playing

“Netball again. His knee ligaments were
torn, his kneecap was dislocated and his
nerves were severely damaged.

“The [knee] injury in and of itself is a
big problem,” said Dr. Aaron Mares, the
Pitt football team’s associate physician.

{:10 come back and play at the level he
was playing at isunheard of.”

After the 2010 injury, the doctors were
contemplating whether Mason would
walk again, letalone playlfootbiall‘. ’

SPORTS

Reclshirt junior Dan Mason (40) lacerated his liver and will mis the rest of the season.

“Right when I was lying on the field,’

I knew I was going to be coming back,”
Mason said. “I never count myself out
of anything. I just kept working. Obvi-
ously, I had my hard days, but I just kept
working.”

' Mason sat out for the rema_inder of
2010 and the entirety of the 2011 sea-
son, but in 2012 he began the season as
a backup to Shane Gordon.

Needless to say, Mason wasn’t used _
toserving as abackup after being an .

All-State player in high school and see-
ing time on the field every game of his
freshman career at Pitt, during which
he recorded 26 tackles, two sacks an
an interception. '

His work ethic beﬁts the underdog.

“I just took itas I got to keep work-
ing,” Mason said. “That’s howl see things.
When you’re second team, you got to work
and earn being a starter.”

While Mason was out, the linebacker
relied on his teammates to keep his mo-
tivation up. I

“I found my teammates were there to
be supportive,” Mason said. “Through
every step coming back from that injury,
I always had a teammate telling me ‘keep
your head up.”’ . .

His efforts didn’t end with the train-
ers ‘or on the practice field. Because of

his lack of mobility, Mason spent hours
watching games and learning more about
the mental aspect of football.

“I definitely just watched so much
more football,” Mason said. “Even games
on TV, just to see different people and
how they approach the game. I listened
to Ray Lewis talk. I listened and watched
it all and soaked it all in. I was thirsty for
knowledge.”

’When you type Dan Mason into Google,
the results are predominantly about that
knee injury. It’s what defines the line-
backer, and it has taught him a lot about
himself. I

“I learned too much from this injury,
as a man and as a player,” Mason said. “I
went through it for a reason,_ and it hap-
pened for a reason.”

What also happened for a reason was
how well Mason played when he returned

‘ to the Pitt starting lineup this year in the

game against Buffalo —- the reason being
the fervor he applied to his recovery. With
everyone telling him it would be nearly
impossible to ever run again, Mason chose
to block out the discouraging possibility
and, in turn, accomplished something
unheard of by competing again. i I

Dispelling a
  few common
‘Steelers f  
misconceptions
§:;,%?.,::f:*.:s

The_re’s a need to address three common mis-

_  regarding  Pittsburgh Steelers.

I .&_,pIn Week 8, ,1, attended the Steelers’ home

lr‘>

« g game against thelWashi'ngtonlRedskins.Sit-

ting in the second-to—last row of the stadium
in section 538, I heard a pair of Steelers fans
behind me talking about Mike Wallace and
Antonio Brown.

I don’t remember the speciﬁcs of what they
said, but, in general, they felt Brown deserved
to be paid more than Wallace on the basis that
Brown provides good gains on third down and
catches the ball better than Wallace, whose
speed they thought didn’t really matter. I
turned around to these gentlemen and said,
“I would rather have the guy who’s scored 22
touchdowns the past three seasons than the
guy who has four.” The rest of the game, I
heard nokmore talk of how Brown was better
than Wallace.

This brings up the ﬁrst misconception:
Wallace doesn’t deserve to get paid what he
does.

To acknowledge the men’s points, though,

-Brown is a great receiver. He topped 1,000
yards last season, runs great routes and al-
ways seems to come up big for the Steelers
on third downs. V

But Wallaceis the fastest receiver in the
league, and in an age when passing game is
the hot trend among NFL offenses, he’s a top
commodity worth big money (he will make
$2.7 million this year before becoming a free
agent at the end of the season). Wallace topped
1,000 receiving yards the past two seasons

and will likely do it again this year if Steelers ’

quarterback Ben Roethlisberger returns.

Steelers fans everywhere remember watch-
ing Plaxico Burress catch a game—winning pass
from Giants quarterback Eli Marming to upset
the undefeated Patriots in the 2007 Super
Bowl. Pittsburgh can’t afford to let Wallace
be lost in the same way.

The second misconceptionlisthatjonathan

Dwyer is the Steelers’. best runningback.
The Steelers’ struggles in the running game
this season are well- documented, and for good
reason. Through 11 games, their rushing at-
tacks rank them No. 22 among 32 NFL teams,
with 101.5_ yards per game. I " r -

Historically, Pittsburgh is well—regarded
for its ability to run the football, dating back
to the days of Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier
in the 1970s. But this year, in terms of success
running the football, the Steelers have been
at the opposite end of the spectrum.

This week, much to the pleasure of yinzers
everywhere, Dwyer — a 2010 sixth—round
draft pick out of Georgia Tech .—-— was moved .
to the top of the Steelers’ depth chart over
Rashard Mendenhall.

Dwyer is not Pittsburgh’s best running
back. Mendenhall is.

Don’t get me wrong, Dwyer is a qual-
ity back who hits holes hard and can break
through arm tackles with his size. And he
did deliver two back—to —back 100—yard rush-
ing performances earlier this season, albeit
coming in the two best games of ofi'ensive—line
play this season.

But Mendenhall is Pittsburgh’s best option.

If the Steelers hope for a postseason berth
and any success in the playoffs, they will need
a quality running game, and that’s where Men-
denhall will need to step up. This season, knee"
injuries have held him out of all but four of
Pittsburgh’s 11 games to date, so he has not
been himself, nor has he had the chance to

I show his_worth.

Now Mendenhall is ﬁnally healthy, as far
as Pittsburgh fans and media are aware, and
should have the shot to be the Steelers’ fea-
ture back. -

In the prime of .his career at 25 years old,

hehas already posted two 1,00o—yard rushing well,does.And, as Steelerfans witnessed Sun- I - ' _ ' ’ ex,

Jonathan Dwyer has had a productive season, but he isn’t the best Steelers runn g

game and left his stat line at 928 yards and
nine touchdowns.
Mendenhall is a proven commodity, and

"within him lies the key to_ the running game’s

Charlie Batch is a capable back-up quar-

in the NFL. But even more difficult, as Pitts-

hurt the Steelers the past few seasons, es-

pecially in Week 12 against the Cleveland

Browns.

Batch frequently missed open receivers
and underthrew Wallace multiple times.
“Checkdown Charlie” missed Heath Miller

ing in Wallace bobbling the ball and Cleveland
picking Batch off, -one of the three times he
was intercepted. A

Don’t get me wrong —— Batch is a great
guy. He ﬁled for bankruptcy in 2011, mostly
because of the large amounts of money he
donated to underprivileged children in the
Pittsburgh area. _
