tions of the Union completed thus far will be open to the
student body from, 3 to 5 p.m. on that date.

‘I

Dr. Peake stressed that this is’
A only a preview,

and ‘that the
grand, formal opening will not
take place until next Fall “by
which time development,” he
hopes, “will be complete.”

Dr. Peake Farther stated, “It

_ isn’t done yet, but it has reached

the stage where we can give the
students a progress report.”

Students who attend the pre-
view will see the Terrace Lounge,
the Inner Lounge, and the Ball
Room, all of which are on the
main floor and can be reached by
entering the Union on the Fifth
Avenue side. ' V

This part of the Union is actu-
ally open now on a temporary
basis for the Chancellor’s Inaugu-
ration, but construction will be
resumed and continue throughout
the remaining part of the semester
and the entire summer.

Monday’s preview is" under
the planning of David Bender,

* Col. '57, and Mary Alice Ham-

 

ilton, Col. ’58, in co-operation
with Dean of Women Helen
Rush and Dean of Men Theo-
dore Biddle. .

It will be completely informal,
and refreshments will be served.
The two Deans, along with,Dr.
Peake and other faculty members,
will be there to talk informally

and individually with the stu-
dents.

The first phase of the Union
is expected to be completed by
Fall. The biggest project be-
tween now and‘ September to
be undertaken is the building of
a huge cafeteria, which will be
air-conditioned.

The ﬁrst four ﬂoors will be for
student use—-—studying, organiza-
tional meetings, etc.

The upper ﬂoors will be taken
up by a men’s residence hall and
will be known as Schenley House.

1 Congress Convenes;

Maps New Policies

Student Congress held their ﬁrst meeting of the yeai
in the French Room of the Student Union, Monday, May 6,
Richard Mattern, PIA representative and Assemblies
Committee Chairman, presented a preliminary statement of
policy for the committee system generally.
The essence of the statement was that the Committee

would serve mainly as a policy 6»

making body, instead of a body
designed to carry out policies.
Congress will approve policies
and then the Committee will
delegate authority to see that
the job is performed adequate-
13'.

The responsibility thus falls
upon Congress in that she must
approve policy with either good
or poor results.

Mark Elovitz, Col. ’60, moved
and Congress approved that the
possibility of music being piped
continuously into the tuck shop
be examined. The Assemblies
Committee will act on the motion.

University Raises
Public Health and
M ed School Tuition

The University will increase
tuition rates for its School of
Medicine and Graduate School
of Public Health, beginning

July 1, 1957. 4
Chancellor E d w a r d H. ‘
Litchﬁeld said that tuition in

medicine will be increased from

$750 a year to $1,000. Tuition in

public health will go from $700
to $960 per year. '
Added Decision

He added that a decision on the

amount of increases in under-

graduate and other graduate and

professional schools will be de—e

layed ‘pending determination by
the state legislature of the size of
its appropriation to the Univers-
ity for the 1957-59 biennium.

The School of Medicine has a
separate endowment and receives
a separate state appropriation for
assistance in maintaining its pro-
gram.
‘ The Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health has a separate en-
dowment which enables it to
"meet a large part of its costs
beyond the amount of tuition
income.

“Medical education is enorm-

ously expensive,” Dr. Robert A. 1

Moore, vice chancellor for the
health schools, stated in explana-
tion of the increases.

Runs $4,000 Year

“At the present time,” he said,
“medical s c h o 0 1 instructional
costs alone run nearly $4,000 per
year for each medical student.

Even with the new tuition rates,
the medical studentwill contrib-
ute only about one—quarter of the
cost of instruction.”

“Other costs must be ﬂmet
through endowment. income,
private gifts, government grants
for special research projects
and a state appropriation divid-
ed on the basis of enrollment
among the medical schools of
the Commonwealth.”

Medicine and public health each
face budget problems in moving
into new buildings which offer
greatly improved teaching facili-
ties and expanding operations in
instruction and research, accord-
ing to Dr. Moore.

ductory discussion on “A Revolu-
tionary Concept in Development
By Evolution, Utilizing Behavior-
al Technology As the Revolution-
ary Concept.”

professor of mathematics at
the university, has been a-
warded a Fulbright Fellow-
ship for the academic school
year of 1957-58 to lecture in
mathematics in Higher Normal
School of Pisa in Pisa, Italy.

Barsotti was selected by the
Board of Foreign Scholarships to
receive this award to participate
in the International Educational
Exchange Program under the Ful-
bright Act. -

This is one of approximately
400 grants for lecturing and re-

      Questions students ask Du Pont

—and "some of the answers in summary form

"Do you hire men who have deﬁnite military commitments?"

 

.s.

 

bright advisers on college and
university campuses’.

 

asks Oran A. Ritter, Jr., of Louisiana State University.

Yes, because DuPont has always been interested in men on a
long—term basis. DuPont has employed many graduates with
military commitments even though they were due to report
for duty a few weeks after joining the Company.

<;.-2 '

i’Where would I work‘ for Du Pont?” asks Gaylord E. Moss,
of .’|'ufIs College.

DuPont ‘has more than 140 plants and research and develop-
ment laboratories scattered through 26 states. If you have a
deﬁnite preference, and DuPont has an opening there for
which you’re qualiﬁed, your chances of getting it are good.

We can give only brief answers to these questions in
this space. But we’ll be glad to answer themhmore
fully, and to try to answer other questions you may
have that bear more directly on your own future. Why
not write us today? Address: The DuPont Company,
2507C Nemours Building, Wilmington 98, Delaware.

   

”Wou|d a graduate degree help my chances for advancement
of Du Pont?" asks John C. Nettleton, of Villcmova University.

A Many factors are involved, and an advanced degree would un-
doubtedly have a favprable eiiect in all technical work, but
it would probably be of more directbeneﬁt in research or de-
velopment at DuPont than in production, marketing or sales.

 

”How are chances for advancement in a large company like

Du Pont?" asks Herschel ‘H. loomis, .|r., Cornell University.

Good! DuPont is large, but it’s made up of 11 independent
departments — like smaller companies — under one manage-

’ ‘ment. And it’s a basic policy to promote from within and on

merit as Company growth creates openings.

Meeting . of Mind:

N everbefore in the history of higher education have so
many leading minds been brought together for the honoring
of one University’s rebirth in education. A new era of edu-
cation has been opened at Pitt and the midwives of this
renaissance are coming from all over the world to in-

— augurate it. » »
‘This weekend more than a new chancellor will be in-

stalled. The mere inauguration of a chancellor would not
call for the academic phenomenon which will take place
here. A simple ceremony at the commencement exercises
administered by the chairman of the board of trustees would
be sufﬁcient. It is not for one man’s glory that the leaders

‘in world society have been called together.

It is instead for the glorious birth.of another great Uni-
versity andthe creation of the crucible from which will pour
future generations of ‘ﬁnely educated men-and women that
university chancellors, scientists, doctors of medicine, and
corporation presidents are coming from far and near to
speak and to listen. ‘

And the listeners will hear new thoughts on the philoso-
phy of higher education. They will go away with their
minds and hearts full of the joys of learning in a free so-
ciety. They will see education of the masses as altool and
weapon for a greater nation. These thoughts will have
echoes around the globe. The world will note what is said
here. i

It is amazing to see at Pitt the awe with which the
forthcominginauguration is greeted by those whomost
understand‘its worldwide implications. It seems that the
closer a person can imagine the scope of this program, the

' 'more boundless its inﬂuence becomes.

James A. “.IlAich'ener Shows .  .

By Ed Bachman

The grains of sand move swiftly through the
hourglass of time, and all too often momental
events of history are pushed far back in man’s
busy Twentieth Century memory. Such is the
hurry-scurry world we live in, when there are
some things which we should never forget.

Such an event happened just a little over at

half year ago;.October 23, 1956,
to be exact. This was the start
of the world-effecting Hungarian
Revolution: At that time, all the f
freedom-loving peoples on earth T
marvelled at the lesson which
was being taught by simple T,
Hungarian peasants and workers. A
It is a lesson which should
never be forgotten.

And it won’t be forgotten if  
at least one man, James A. Michener has any-
thing to say about it. For this world-renowned
author has set on paper his ever-lasting ﬁrst-hand
impressions of "a nation’s life under communistic
rule, and their efforts to shake off the Russian-
controlled slime.in which they were mired.

Michener’s Book Powerful

And Michener has put all this in a most mem-
orable book, The Bridge at Andau (Random
House, $3.50). Adjectives haven’t been invented
to describe this book. It is a powerful book, and
it is a terriﬁc experience to read it. Those per-
fectionists who are seeking only ﬂawlessly-written
passages will ﬁnd faults in Michener’s writing,
granted, but in the last analysis, the main point
to be considered is not how Michener says it, but
what he says. And what he says is stark truth,
though it be terrifying and horrible in its content’.

So while thisﬁbook doesrrt‘ contain the poetic
peaks of his Tales of the South Pacific, which won
him the Pulitzer Prize in 1947, or the sense of
humor’ of some of his latter books, like The Bridges
at Toko—ri, Michener has nevertheless come‘ up

I with an amazing book.

  

Reader Lives Revolt
And so, The Bridge at Andau isrthe story-_of
Hungary, and you, the reader, live it with them.
In reading the book, you follow average, plain,
everyday people. You live with them under com-
munistic terror. You ‘suffer with them in the

prisons of the dreaded AVO. You go to secret pro-
test meetings with young college students. You
are ﬁred upon‘ by panicky AVO men when thou-
sands of citizens form in the public square.

And then the revolution starts. You ‘then see,
vividly, how the Hungarian population beat back
the AVO might with their bare hands. Young

boys crawl on their hands and knees to destroy,

Russian tanks with homemade gasoline ‘bombs.
Soviet ariplanes are shot out of the air with an-
tiquated guns. Russian troops even turn on the
AVO. Communism and its terror is pushed out of

cl-Iungary by the people of Russia had counted’

upon most, the intellects and the workers; those
people who are considered, by the Commies, to
reap the most under Red rule.

The West. and Freedom

Finally faced with defeat, the great evacuation
of thousands of Hungary’s finest people began. Uri‘-
able to stomach any longer the horror of com-
munism, nearly 200,000 people, representing the
cream of Hungary’s crop, made their way to /the
West, and the American border. It was not easy,
as these brave people had to make their way
through marshes, AVO men, their machine, guns
and bloodhounds, near-zero temperatures, and lack
of food. But the stamina of great men, women and
children kept them going, and the refugees made
it over such border points as the bridge at Andau,
where Michener was first introduced to these re-
markable people.

And now these people are scattered throughout

the world, and they are telling the true story of‘.

communism. For they have lived under it, and
they have learned of its heartless terror arid“ de-
struction. ’

As Michener says, “Budapest was a dreadful price A

to pay for such knowledge, but if the knowledge
is widely disseminated among those who were un-
aware of it before, and if Russia’s cynical and dis-
graceful lies are laid bare to the rest of the world,
the death of this noble city will not have been in
vain.” , ‘
Each and every American owes it to himself,
and to the Free World, to understandthe deceit
and the lies of communism. Reading The Bridge
at Andau is a great start at understanding the
truth. ~.



Spirit of the Union

By Millard Amdur
W i l l i a m Swartzbaugh

1956-57 and ’57-’58 at the joint
banquet held recently at the
College Club. Swartzbaugh has
been appoint-
ed to head the
new Student
Union and will
assure his new
post on July 1.
He comes from
Ohio State Uni-
versity where
he is program
director of the
Union program.

His remarks
were on a high »
plane dealing with some of the
intangibles of a great Univer-
sity. Congress members enjoyed

the forthright presentation and”

logical ideas of the new admin-
istrator. His obvious sincerity
and deep conviction were evi-
dent to his listeners.

He began by making the state-
ment that he is a strong advo-
cate of both Student Union and
Student Government. The Union
and Government work in con-
junction with the University
community. Swartzbaugh then
asked a rhetorical question
which has been tasked countless
times before: “What is a ‘great
University’?” .-

Besides its obvious function as
a teaching and learning institu-
tion it is a “serving institution,”
and, as such, promotes a sharing
of inspiration "and ideas. But
what does the great University
contribute to its students?

The three major objectives he '

discussed were competence, com-
passion, and concentration. Ac-
cording to the new Union direc-
tor, it certainly behooves the
University to retain as a pri-
mary objective, but certainly not
the only one, the furtherance of
competence. But competence is
not enough. ‘

ad- 
dressed the Student Congress of '

ederstanding.”

 

The technician without a Uni-
versity' education may exhibit
competence, but most likely
would not show “depth of un-
The closest of
friendships are those character-

" ized by the display of deep com-

passion. This compassion, con-

_notes consideration more than

anything else.
This is the product of the “in-

ner discipline of the University.”_
‘Organization and consideration-

lead to achievement; Prime
Minister Nehru of India once
said during a visit to the Wis-
consin Union, “The chief aim of
the University is to teach un-
derstanding.”

After this assertion, Schwartz-
baugh referred to the subtle, yet
well-appraised remarks of an
Equadorian student.

This individual was speaking
of the whole concept of Univers-
ity education which may ulti-
mately be achieved when he
said: “I was wandering on a
mountain when I saw in the dis-
tance a form. At ﬁrst I thought
it was a beast. As I came nearer
the form, I realized that it was
a man;
proached the man, I recognized
him as my brother.”

There is certainly good reason
to quote this astute presentation
of the service which the Union
of a University can provide,
namely a further awareness of
the brotherhood of man. The
third ideal which the student
might well acquire from a “great
University” is sense of devotion
and dedication.

The President’s Commission
reported: “Teaching and learn-
ing must be vested in public
service.” The same devotion to
duty ideally pervades both of
these ﬁelds. Devotion is one at-
tribute the. automaton, robot,
and assembly-line technician do
not have. It’s a vital characteris-
tic in many respects.

The University Union can bet

and as I ﬁnally ap-

the center of education for citi-
zenship, of recreation, and of a
vast social program. It may fos-
ter student government as well.
Swartzbaugh indicated thatethe
relationship of government to
Union follows no set pattern but
varies with circumstances.
Dynamic Program Seen
In the Union, the interests of
many are realized. To mention a
few widely diversiﬁed ones,

mechanical geniuses may pro-e -

duce lathes, Dent students may
practice sculpturing jaw bones,
and extermination enthusiasts
may experiment in rodent trap-
ping. A dynamic program for
everyone who takes" advantage‘
of it is possible in the Student
Union.f ‘

It seems reasonable for me to
claim, with the substantiation of
an- authority, that the “educa-
tion” learned in the Union can-
not be acquired in the classroom
by the same token, the produc-
tion of dedicated, compassionate,

' “educated,” ‘men and; women,

rather than “competent” tech-
nicians, is characteristic of a’,
“great University.”

We at Pitt will soon have the 

opportunity to enjoy fully, under

the direction of a devoted gen-

tleman, our own Student Union’
(to be previewed this week). But

if the commuting‘ student re-

gards this as merely another ac-

tivity to avoid, and if the stu-

dent body as a unified whole

does not take advantage of such

a program, Pitt will never be‘
numbered among the truly

“great Universities.”

It is the responsibility of
everyone at the University to
utilize the facilities as soon as
they become available regularly
in the autumn, to spend as much
free time as possible at the
Union and in University activity
(outside the classroom), and
thus to proﬁt fully from the ver-:.
satile program of a revamped,
revitalized educational: program.

Professor of Chemistry Begins
Speaking Tour of West States

Dr, Henry Freiser, associate professor of chemistry at
the university started on a speaking tour recently that will

take him through 14 western

states.

Dr._Freiser is speaking before local sections of the Ameri-
can Chemical Society, and various western university groups
in a total of 19 talks in the next 30 days.

The national oﬂice of the 6

American Chemical Society,
which arranged for most of the
talks, invited the Pitt professor
to lecture on the subject of his
recent research. He will discuss
two aspects of his work.

In one, “Solvent Extraction,” he
will discuss a technique that is of
great signiﬁcance in achieving
separations of complex mixtures.‘
This work has many applications
in analytical chemistry where
separation is often the key step
in analysis of complex mixtures.
The technique is also E important
in large scale chemical processing.

Another aspect of Dr. Freiser’s
work deals with “Metal Che1ates,”
a_ "type of compound which has
wide interest. Dr. Feiser, who was
invited to address an international
chemical congress in Oxford, Eng-
land, in 1952 on his work, has
studied theoretical and practical
aspects of formation and behav-
ior of metal chelates.

Dr. Freiser, who has been a
member of the Pitt chemistry
faculty since 1946, has been
quite active in the local and
national activities of the Amer-
ican Chemical Society.

 

He has held offices in the analy-
tical chemistry, chemical educa-
t i o n and physical chemistry
groups. He is also an oﬁicer of the

American Society of Testing Ma-
terials. ‘

One can easily conclude, judging from the tone of Coach

Carl Olson.’s voice, that his

meet Notre Dame at the Stadium beginning at 1:30 p.m.
“You needn't ask me how we .are going to do,” says

last year (ND, 82—Pitt, 48')

when we had Arnie (Sowell). He’s
not around this year, so ﬁgure it
out for yourself,” added the Pan-
ther coach.

It doesn’t take too much ﬁgur-
ing. it all adds up to a closemeet
throughout the track events; then
come the ﬁeld events in, which the
Panthers are more likely than not

' to feel the strength of the Fighting

Irish. The locals’ main hope is
that the Irish ﬁeld men will have
an off day so that Wes King, Cor-,

“ ny Salvaterra, and Bill Smith can

sneak in a few ﬁrst or ‘second
places to make the ﬁnal score

close.

Irish Loaded

” Here's an ideasof the strength

of the South Bend tracksters:
They have a mile relay team
composed of Bill Keegan, Frank
Ewart, Aubrey Lewis, and Joe.

‘Foreman which has covered the

5.280 feet in 3_:13.1. The best
time for the Panther quartet of
Charley Heﬂin, Dick Doyle, Zinnie
Smith, and Ed Saunders this year
has been 3:18 against Miami
(Ohio). '

Foreman, who was a member
of the 1956 Canadian Olympic
team,’ is an extremely fast dash-
man. He ran the ‘100’ and ‘220’

. for Canada in the Games, but
is expected to run in the. 440- .
yard dash on Saturday. There is

i a good chance that he will also
run in the shorter sprint events.

' Lewis, a standout on the Notre

Dame‘ football team for three

years, will be entered in a multi-
tude of events.

“He,mig=ht run the high hurdles,
low hurdles, ‘100’, ‘220’, or ‘440’,”
says Olson. “He is likely to be in
the broad jump and the ja_velin,
too. He’s so fast and versatile that
they can afford to put him in any

' event they think ‘they need to pick

up» points,” gloated the ﬁrey Pan-
ther coach. it
Timon vs. Haverty

The mile grind is another event
in which the Blue and Gold ap-
pears to be outclassed. The vis-
itor’s Dick DiCamillo hasirun the

Worth really proved his worth

, as he sent 16 Academy batters

the seven innings.

Nick. Karsonas led the Cub
15-hit attack with a homer,

‘D ave Starrett emptied the
bench in an effort to avert the
rout. “It’s sure great to win the
ﬁrst one. It was‘ a real team vic-
tory. The boys have worked

mented Coach Starrett.

The Cubs swing into action
again on Saturday when ' they
play West Virignia in the night-
cap of a doubleheader which ﬁnds
the varsity meeting the Mountie
varsity in the opening attraction.

The Cubs will probably be more
severely tested against West Vir-
ginia because the Mounties have
one of the top freshman teams in

One of the top tests of endur-
ance will be the two-mile mara-
thon, providing the Panthers’
ace distance man-—Vince Timon
—is at peak form. Timon has
been under the care of a physi-
cian for the biggest part of the
season which has greatly re-
duced the kick required to be a
potent distance runner.

Timon will duel Mike Haverty
in the two-mile run. Haverty’s top
time for the year has been 9:26.5
while Timon is capable of better-
ing 9:24 if he is feeling right.

The Fighting Irish are very
strong in the ﬁeld events, too.

Bill Hamilton, who has been a

and lost to Ohio State, 5-1.

Tom Cook, six-foot lefthand-
er, is the possible’ Mountie

back from last year. Rod Schaf--
or is at third base. and Jim
Senay is the center fielder. Two
sophomores are also in the start-
ing nine - Ronnie Retton at

iCoach Lewis was jovial, for

good reason, after the Panthers’

cent. Bearcats on Monday. Al-
though he would not offer a guess
as to the locals’ chances for a bid
to the National Collegiate Ath-

thoughts on the chances for the

up, we will be real tough.”

He continues, “I don’t know
abqht the NCAA. We have our
big games coming up, and they
will mean a lot.” The NCAA
committee. selects four teams
from this district for the district
playoffs, and the Panthers could
very well be among that quar-
tet if they continue their cur-
rent slugging.

The Panther bats couldn’t be
halted again on Monday as they
swatted out a 15-1 victory in sev-
en innings over St. Vincent. Lind-

Bearcats, and he was given more
power than he needed. In fact, he

Catcher Fred DeLost was the
big gun for the Cats with his per-
fect four-for-four day at the
plate. One of thoie four safeties
was a home run with two men
aboard in the third inning. The
other three were a double and
two singles. He had a total of ﬁve
runs batted in.

Jim Dunlap and Corky Cost
also had perfect days at bat.
Dunlap went to the plate three
times and had three hits, one
a two-run circuit blast. Cost
also chipped in with a three-

EIGA Classic
At Annapolis

By HAROLD LEINER

The Panther golfers will 2

participate in the Eastern In-A
tercollegiate Golf Association
at Annapolis, Md., this week-
end. Last year the locals fin-
ished ninth as Ken Fisher
missed qualifying. for the individ-
ual championship by only one
stroke.

The rules of the tournament
say that the scores of only the top
four men count in the team’s
scores.~ Each team, however, is
allowed to enter a couple of ex-
tra men.

Besides Pitt the - tournament
will include the country’s top
collegiate teams and golfers.
Making the trip for the Blue
A and Gold will be Ron Schwarz-
el, who has been outstanding in
dual meets this season, plus Bill
Reilly, Bob Hixson, W a d e
Hershberger, and Dave Brown.
-Coach Dave McCormack is hop-
ing that his linkers will ﬁnish

higher than last year when the.

team placed ninth. McCormack
feels that all of his players will
play good golf during the tourna-
ment, ‘ but he thinks that -Ron
Schwarzel, a ﬁrst year man on

the team who was a former three-1 ,

time state scholastic champ from
Brentwood, will be the Panther
most likely to grab
honors.

After the tournament the re-
maining schedule will see the Pan-
thers at home to ‘West Virginia on
May 22, away at Penn State on
May 25, and at home against Du-
quesne on May 729 in the season
ﬁnale.

  Quarterback Spot
  Shows Inexperience

An unusual problem faces Coach John l\/lichelosen at the q‘uarter-
back "slot for the 1957 grid season. His starting signal-caller, as well
as the other quarterbacks, has not had enough past experience to
win a letter. S M

Bill Kaliden, a Homestead product, was a sophomore last year
and of ,course received a limited among} of actual game experience.

.It was either unpredictable Corny Salvaterra or southpaw Darrell

Lewis under center.

When Kaliden did get into a game, there was no pressure on
him, so he still did not have the necessary experience. Now the
six-footer has been given the most important job on any T-formation
team. ‘ ‘

How capably he handles it could very well decide where the
Panthers stand in the national rankings at the end of the season.
Coach Mioghelosen offers his opinion of Kaliden: “Bill has the
makings of an outstanding quarterback. We didn’t have good
passing weather during Spring practice so he ’didn’t get a chance
to try his arm. ,

“But he has good potential and he is a better passer than we

' have had in some time. He’s not as strong a runner as Salvaterra, but

he has better speed.”

Many grid fans will be watching Kaliden very closely to see
whether he will use as much of a running game as Salvaterra did
lastyear. The pressure will also be on him to keep the Panthers
at the plateau they have reached in lVlichelosen’s s
first two seasons‘ here.

Kaliden’s replacement is a senior, Char-
leroi’s Jim Lenhart. Lenhart has been a var-
sity man since 1954, when ironically enough he
played his ﬁnest game.

This came in the rain against Penn State. The
Panthers were whitewashed, 13-0, but Lenhart led
the local eleven to within scoring distance one
time. But since that game, the 195 pounder hasn’t
seen too much varsity action. ..

Michelosen thinks that Lenhart could be of T011010
a lot of assistance to the team this year. He isthe tallest quarter-
back, standing 6 feet, 2 inches.

The newcomer among the quartet is Ivan Toncic, last seaon’s
starting freshman signa1—caller. Toncic, hailing from Midland, is *5
feet, 11 inches tall, and weighs 175 pounds. Although he will not

be on the field too much this year, as is the custom with lVIichelosen--

coached teams, Toncic should prove a good future gridder in Panther
plans. ’ V i
Michelosen seems to agree with this possibility. Says the
Skyscraper U. braintrust, “Toncic has nice spark. He has ‘a good

the key spot is Peter Prince, a
junior from Nashua, New Hamp-
shire. At 5 feet, 10 inches, and
185 pounds, Prince is considered
a strong boy in the backﬁeld. Dur-
_ing' the Spring, Prince didn’t get
too’ much of a chance to operate
out of the quarterback position be-
cause of the lack of halfbacks.
When a few of the regular halfs
were sidelined with injuries the
past month, Prince was moved
over to right halfback. Thus, he

missed some valuable practice at
his regular post. ‘it

At Home Today  

Panther tennis Coach Ben
Pope said last week that “it
would take several matches‘
for his netters to ﬁnd them-
selves.” Pope proved himself
right sooner than he expected,

because in the locals’ next outing
against St. Francis (Loretto), they
trounced the Frankies, 9-0, for
their first win of the season.

Today, the Blue and Gold net-

men will go after their second
straight triumph when they play
the Duquesne Dukes on the Mel-
lon Park court starting at 2 p.m.

The Jungle Cats will also be
in action on Friday and Satur-
day when they meet West Vir-
ginia and Navy in road tests.

On Friday the locals will be in
Morgantown to play the Mounties’
and then they will make the jaunt
to Annapolis, Md., to battle the
Navy in a Saturday afternoon en-
