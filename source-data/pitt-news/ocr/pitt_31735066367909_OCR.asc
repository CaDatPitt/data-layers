Fraternity Brawl Under Investigation

By CHRISTINA CLINTON
And MARY KANE

A large scale brawl Saturday
night involving several Pitt fra-
ternities is being investigated by
university and fjraternity
officials.

Both campus and Pittsburgh

police were called to Zeta Beta
T'au fraternity on Bayard Street
after a fight at that fraternity
erupted into what some
observers called a “near riot.”
No one was arrested, according
to police reports. City paramed-
ics were called, and a few stu-
dents were treated for minor
ininries.
ZBT officials‘ refused to com-.
ment, but the president of Delta
Tau Delta, whose house is adja-

cent to ZBT’s and whose
members were involved in the
fight, said he believed the trou-
ble started with some non-
fraternity members who
attended ZBT’s party that
night.

, ‘‘It was just a few people who
couldn’t handle themselves and
got upset when they were asked
to leave,” Mike Henry said.

“ZBT had a problem with
some guys who were in their
basement. They (ZBT) tried to
get/them out and got as far as
the front porch. When they got
to the front porch, some ZBT
members asked some of our
brothers if they could help.

"Some (Delta Tau Delta)
brothers went over, and that’s
when some punches were
thrown,” Henry said. ‘

Campus police estimated the
number of people at the scene at
50, but other observers said the
crowd outside the fraternity
houses may have numbered
near 300;

Andy Smith, director of stu-
dent activities, said his office
will be meeting with ZBT offi-
cials this week to determine
what happened.

He -called
“inexcusable.”

_‘fThe .university considers
this a very serious occurrence,”
Smith said. .

.He said possible sanctions
against fraternities or students
involved have not yet been
determined. _

“We also want to show the direct

Pitt's Progressive Student Net-
work will protest cutbacks in stu-
dent financial aid with a program
called “Funds For Education Not

The program will be held on

Wednesday Sept. 22, 1982 between
11 a.m. and 4 p.m., on-t.he patio“o'f
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall. Progressive Network Presi-
dent Tom Wanko saidthe program
will include speakers who will link
the cutbacks in student aid and ser-
vice to the Reagan Administra-
tions’ four-year $1.5 trillion
defense budget.

“The event will give Pitt stu-

“These funds should be used to
pay for social programs and to
increase access to higher education
for all Americans," he said.

Wanko blamed the lack of oppo-
sition to the tuition hikes and cut-
backs in student aid to the
ill-informed stydent body and the
“do nothing” attitude of the Stu-
dent Government Board. \

“We have a tremendously unin-
formed student body who does not
know the serious consequences of
the Reagan cutbacks and a lacka-
daisical student government which
cares more about homecoming
floats than issues that affect stu-
dents,” hesaid...

president Randy Bardol
announced that an ad hoc com-
mittee was being formed to
“investigate the situation to see
if any changes should be
made.”

Greg Wilson, IFC internal
vice-president, will head the
committee, and fraternity advi-
sor Louis McLinden will sit on
the committee, along with three
other fraternity officials.

“I was prepared to bring the
incident up because it gives the

entire system a bad name,”

McLinden said. “Randy sur-
prised me by appointing me to
the ad hoc committee. He kind
of knockedthe air out of me."

McLinden said he did not
bring the subject up because of
that appointment.

New  
Party
Formed  

By LYNNE LACEY

Pitt students now have a new
alternative to the campus’ typically
conservative political groups—the
Constitutional Syndicalist Party.

The Pitt chapter, which is the
party’s only chapter, supports
equal democratic control of the
workplace and ultimately of all
institutions. In addition, it also
advocates a parliamentary govern-
ment system, based on the voter’s
ability to replace a leader at any
time through a vote of no
confidence. —

“The party is based ona different
economic system; syndicalism,”

explained chapter president, Bar- 2

ton Levenson.

While communist businesses are
government-owned and capitalist
businesses are privately owned,
syndicalists’ businesses, called syn.-
dicates, are owned and managed
democratically.

In a syndicate, workers elect one
member to act as manager for as
long as the majority is convinced
that he or she is doing a good job.

“In theory, this parliamentary
election method prevents strikes,”
Levenson said. “If the workers
don’t like a manager, then he is
voted out. A strike would only hurt
themselves.”

Levenson said this economic sys-
tem would, if implemented,
improve the workers’ performan-
ces because they would no longer
be working for someone else but for
themselves.

Productivity would also be
improved die to employee stock
ownership. This incentive has
been used in West Germany with
positive results. A.

Better managerial judgments
would be made, according to Lev-
enson, because
elects a council of its members to
manage the plant rather than hire a
disassociated manager, who would
not be equally familiar with the
plant’s inner workings.

Along with vice president Eliza-
beth Penrose, Levenson formed
this group because of a belief that
the major parties were not solving

Fraternity
Groups

Choose
Housing

By GREG PET R0

Most of Pitt’s 22 fraterni-
ties will not be participating
in a university housing com-
plex project because of fear of
university regulations and
belief in mai_ntaing their cur-
rent houses. -

Fourteen out of 22 fraternities
will not participate in the hous-
ing project which is to be com-
pleted in January 1984, The
complex now under construc-
tion will house eight
fraternities.

The building site is located at
University Drive D and part of
Trees Hall field. The specu-
lated cost of the complex is $3.2
million, according to Dr. John
Verana, Assistant Vice Chancel-
lor of business finance.

He said the eight units cost
$400,000 each, with each frater-
nity paying $100,000 and the
university paying the differ-
ence. The fraternity must pay
$50,000 before signing the con-
tract $25,000 during occupany
and the remainder within three
years after occupancy.

Randy Bardol, Interfraternity
Council president and member
of Phi Gmma Delta, said his
fraternity was not moving to the
complex because "the ideas of
brotherhood and relationships
with people without an author-
itative input from administra-
tion will make a unique
product to offer.” ’

“We have a working, con-
structive relationship with the
neighbors that is excellent,”

Bardol said.

Pi Kappa Alpha vice presi-
dent Greg Wilson said his fra-
ternity had no other choice than
to move to the complex. He said
their present house is owned by
am university and they will be
forced to leave it when the com-
plex is built.

He said the complex will

“enhance the fraternity com-

munity,” but the members are
worried about what the univer-
sity will do as far as policy.

Wilson said other fraternities
don’t want to move to the com-
plex because they don’t want to
be subject to university policy.

The property will be owned
by the university and fall under
its jurisdiction like any univer-
sity. facility ac'cordin"g to
Verana.

Delta Tau Delta president
Mike Henry said his fraternity

compared the cost of repairing L

their house and moving to the

complex, and “moving up on

the hill was in our favor.

“Economics was a big factor
here”, he said, “I would like to
see the fraternities come closer
together and be mature enough
to police ourselves and take care
of our own problems, within
reason.”

Frraternities not participat-
ing in the complex project must
improve their rush system and

competition coming from the

Pitt students who ride bicy-
cles will have to park in new
loc-ations this fall because the
campus police relocated four
bicycle racks to increase
security.

William Tucker, director of
the campus police, said, “We
moved the racks which were
hardest hit with a minimum of
inconvenience to students,”

The four racks, which were
ﬁgygmoved sometime in July, were

lem _wit_h__t_l_i,i s, he said, was that
“the service costs were eating
our budges alive." Fifteen
separate bike rack locations
were too many for the police to
patrol effectively.

According to Tucker, the
racks from both the Cathedral
of Learning and Hillman
Library are now located in the
basement of Forbes Quadran-
gle. Here bicycle racks can be
secured by both camera moni-
tors and a full time guard

 

  
     

oBike Racks Relocated

Amos Hall, the Forbes Quad-
rangle garage, the Music Build-
ing the Langley Hall garage,
and the Library and Informa-
tion Science Buidling.

Tucker said that in order to
increase security, he proposed
the plan for location reduction
to the administration.

Tucker said they received
administration support and
proceeded to get support from
other student bodies.

Student Government presi-
dent Todd DeLuca said having
the bike racks in a central loca-
tion would help stop bicycle
from being stolen. "

DeLuca said there were two
options: either move the bicycle
racks or hire extra security
people.

With the budget cuts the uni-
versity has to deal with, moving
the racks seemed to be the more
viable plan, according to
DeLuca.

Tucker said students and staff
don’t secure their bicycles with
strong locks and therefore, peo-
ple with bolt cutters are able to
steal them.

Campus police suggest using

S the citadel brand lock. Accord-

ing to a pamphlet advertising
the Citadel, this lock is
guaranteed

“If your bike is stolen because

of the failure of a Citadel to pre-
vent theft, we will pay you the

Aid Available

Although financial aid is a
big issue today, many students
are not aware of what aid is
available. The following is a
list of aid available:

Federal financial assistance is
divided into three categories.
“Grants" are awards of money
that do not have to be paid back.
“Loans‘ are borrowed money
that a student must repay with
interest. “Work-Study” pro-
vides the chance to work and
earn money to off-set college
costs while attending classes.

The Pell Grant Program for-
merly called the Basic Educa-
tional Opportunity Grant the
Pell Grant is often the firs
source ofaid in a package
which may be composed of
other Federal and non-Federal
sources. In the 1982-83 school
year, 2.55 million students
share $2,279,040,000 in Pell
Grants. The U.S. Department
of Education uses a standard
formula to determine who
qualifies for Pell Grants. Stu-
dents should contact the college
financial aid administrator to

‘ apply. This “Application for
Federal Student Aid” is the
form used for all federal student

aid programs. The Department
guarantees that each participat-
ing school will receive the
money it needs to pay Pell
Grants to eligible students.

Targeted to help those stu-
dents whose families earn less
than $12,000 per year, usually
grant aid does not cover all col-
lege costs but is to be combined
with contributions from the
student’s family, generally in
the form of loans, private scho-
larships and work.

Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grant
This grant is different from the
Pell Grant in that it is managed
by the financial aid administ-
rtor of each participating col-
lege. Each school receives a set.
amount of money from the
department and when that
money is gone, there are no
more SEOG funds for the year.

In 1982-83 the Department of
Education will provide 440,000
students with $278,400,000 in
Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants. Students
will get up to $2,000 a year

“This way the police can con-

Hall is at the Thackeray Street

Due to renovation of Schen-

eliminated, according to police
officer Arthur Dorman.

Tucker said the number of
bicycle rack placements on

to 10, but the total bicycle space
capacity will remain the same.

The present bicycle rack loc-

Tucker said it is a violation of

a city ordinance to lock bicycles

to trees and parking meters and

advises students to use the
‘designated bike racks.

Tucker also said he would
like to ask for voluntary regis-
tration of bicycles so that the
campus police can identify
bicycles by number.

As a result of these measures,
according to Tucker, not only
will the university community
save their bicycles, but X the
police can save dollars on per-
sonnel overtime.

the Republican platform has
cracked and that the Democrats
were too concerned with who could
cut more taxes and most dis-
member the government.

“We could solve the economic
crisis in short order,” Levenson
said. The first step would be to bal-

. ance the budget by cutting expen-

ditures and raising taxes. Next
would be the implementation of a
new monetary policy in which the
money supply would be kept at a
rate equal to the Gross National
Product of the previous four
quarters.

rather than a highly technical one,
as President Reagan does.

In an effort to recruit more
members, the group is in the pro-
cess of changing its name to the
Democratic’ Enterprise Party.
According to Levenson, a syndicate
is a democratic enterprise.

The CSP has “a small» number of

members,” according to Levenson. ..

Because the group failed to sub-
mit a budget proposal on time, it is
difficult for them to fund activities.
They have, however, issued an
open invitation to any other politi-
cal group for a debate.

Summer Of ’82  

A Few Memories Before Fall Sets In

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

In the upcoming week, a
marvelous epoch will end. It
will not be the fall of apolitical
system or the retirement of a

. grand athlete. The amazing fact
is that the closing epoch is not
of man’s ‘design. It is the hum-
.ble but necessary closing of the
summer of 1982.

The end will come without
fanfare, without cheer, and
probably,- without notice. But
in looking back and reflecting,
wasn’t it a glorious summer?

“It was a fantastic summer,”
says Hairy Kunselman, a Pitt
student. “I got to spend my
entire summer away from
home.” , .

“But -wasn’t‘ it worth more
than that?” _

“Oh, yeah, I partied a lot.”

“Yes. But what about those

memorable moments? The
times spent in swatting the
mosquitoes away, sleepless hot
nights, a game of tennis, weed-
ing the garden, having the car
overheat, wearing shorts, hang-
ing clothes on a clothesline to
‘dry, slipping in a cool swim-
ming pool, the smell of suntan
lotion, sitting on the front
porch, watching a baseball
game on TV, having the air
conditioner breakdown, eating
an ice-cream cone, taking a
walk on the beach, -eating
charred hamburgers that were
leftrtoo long on the grill, the
buzz of a fly close to an ear,
green leaves hanging from
trees?”

“Oh, yeah. I took out a lot of

Y)

 

 

The September equinox is
not far away, but there is still
time to experience the sensa-
tions of the summer.

“Say there. How was your
summer?” .

“I couldn’t find a job.”

“But what about the cool

I breeze, cutting the lawn, sip-

ping lemonade, painting a
house, going on vacation,
going to the county fair, listen-
ing to crickets at night, sweat-
ing without having to move,

having absolutely nothing to '

do.”

“Most of my friends couldn’t
find jobs either.”

The days of the child will
soon be forgotten, so why not
enjoy while you can? If that
isn’t possible, then why not
pretend? If everyone who talks
about living life to the fulllest
would, then maybe ' we
wouldn’t need summer to break
the monotony.

Is it the imagination of the
writer or are there a lot of peo-
ple on campus who are desper-
ately trying towear their new
fall’ fashions? Will not the win-
ter be here soon enough with-
out trying torush it? Anyways,

‘how can a person feel comforta-
ble wearing a sweater when the
sweat is dripping off his
forehead? .

Say, isn’t that a professor sit-
ting down in the front of class?

“Hello Dr. Harris (Pitt pro-
fessor Joseph Harris). How was
your summer?” »

“It wasn’t as good as the
sumrner of ’42.” ' .

“Oh. But surely you did
something?”

 

“Well, I did conduct a con-
flict management seminar at a
Presbyterian college.”

“Anything else?”

“I wrote some book reviews.”

“Yes but didn’t you do any-
thing that was exciting and
new?”

gt!
:

I ,. Sure.»-I moved from Scran-

ton to Pittsburgh. Oh, I almost
forgot. I did do some fishing on
the Gulf.”

“Well at least you did some-
thing in the summer. But I was
thinking of something with
more value.” Don’t_ get me
wrong; fishing on the Gulf was
a good start. How about the
other things of the summer
though? Driving in a car with
the windows down, sleeping in
a hammock, walking through a
sprinkler, trimming hedges,
waxing a car, wearing white
suits, reading a book that you
want to read, taking a leisure
walk, looking at a field of flow-
ers, throwing a Frisbee, paying
school taxes, watching a
Fourth of July parade, catching
fireflies, taking a boat ride?”

“I guess I missed out on those!

things.”

“You mean that you didn’t
even try?”

“No.”

“You didn’t try to hear the
Good Humor manjingle by, go
shopping for hours, go to a
lawn party, eat a toasted marsh-
mallow, light a firecracker,
have a long Labor Day wee-
kend, swat’ at flies that were
continually swarming around
your food, sleep out under the
stars, listen to a portable radio
while laying out under the sun
or go to a B-rate horrorlmovie at

. a drive-in?”

“I guess I kind of did miss out
on those things.”

Sometimes it’s hard to define
what the summer is. Is it a time,
a place, an event? Maybe, it
could be a touch of everything
compacted in a four month
time span. It's a time of walk-
ing without having to go any-
where, going to an amusement
park with a child, living in a
fantasy world while still caring
about reality, visiting an art
museum, diving off board and
doing a bellysmacker.

“Well, hello President Rea-
gan. I didn’t know that you
would be visiting Pitt."

“I had some free time so I
thought I would help the

school administration cut the

budget.”

“Did they need your help?”

“No. They're doing just
fine.”

“So, Mr. President. How was
your summer?”

“ . I v . ,,

“Great! I planned new ways
to cut the national budget.”

dance; dance; dance, wonder
who will win the pennant...”

“I cut the budget.”

Frightening And

Networking is fast becoming the word for the
eighties. It is not just politically chic, it is politi-
cally essential. It used to be that rallies, demonstra-
tions and teach-ins alone were enough to enlighten

As President Reagan has his way and_ shifts more
of the responsibility for education and other social
programs from the federal to the state and local
levels, it is becoming increasingly important to have
visible organized groups of students—and money

Think about it. Other social and community
groups are now seeing the benefits of imitating
Richard Viguirie and his magic mailing lists of

members of the Right, not to forget proof of the
effectiveness of political action committee (PAC)-
the best representation money can buy.

Students have clout, -too. Case in point: student
lobbying groups like the Commonwealth Associa-
(CAS), a state-wide group that
represents Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned campuses.
According to executive director Joyce Cheepudom,
CAS has a full-time studentstaff in Harris.burg and
has been successful in blocking such legislation as
the $75 tuition increase announced last February by
Gov. Dick Thornburgh. The association also
became the first student group to establish a political
action committee to endorse candidates in this fall’s

Smart move, but Pitt isn’t state-owned.

Pitt’s non-partisan Governmental Relations
Committee (GRC) lobbies in Harrisburg and occa-
sionally with CAS. Pitt students could have a dra-

' matic effect on elections and decision making if only
they would vote, but what of the additional clout

the example of numerous other
groups, why can’t state-related universities like Pitt
also form a PAC? It could be implemented in a way
that a standard voluntary fee agreed to by the stu-
dents, would provide the necessary funds. GRC
Chairperson Connie Kreischer agrees that a PAC
would be an idea worth looking into, but adds that a
PAC without significant voter turn-out would be

A political action committee could also be a learn-
ing experience that, by its existence, would heighten
student awareness and involvement. We have seen

» that funding cuts mean cutbacks in academic depart-
ments and, in the case of the geography department,
we’ve seen them disappear. Will it be the only one to
go or will Pitt lose more than just the geography
department? Even the department of education
could conceivably be phased out until there’s

The GRC lobbying has been effective on its own
using facts and professional attitudes. Still, general
student interest and concern is fickle and, for the

Organization, it seems, has its problems. The old
problem of student apathy is only one example.
Combine that with a political awareness of negative
one and a false sense of security that “whatever
happens out there doesn't affect me really”-—-and it's
a "frightening combination. Frightening and naive.

WELL,

A Sure Measure Of Progress

By MARY KANE

There are some little known reg-'
ulations here at the university that
every student and faculty group
will want to know about. We hap-
pened to come across them while
scouring through obscure, dusty
volumes of meeting minutes in
our advisor’s office,

This information is not for the
squeamish. If we were to take leave
entirely of our critical senses, we
would label the regulations nau-
seating; but, of course, we want to
remain objective, so without
further ado we’ll present them in
their unabridged form.

While reading them, keep in
mind that the university fully sup-
ports discussion of controversial
issues. It's just thatfthere’s a right
way and a wrong way to discuss
controversy. Therefore, to make
sure Pitt student organizations get
it right, Pitt offers the following,
helpful, mandatory suggestions:

If a political or other controver-
sial issue is to be discussed by a
speaker at a meeting of any recog-
nized university student organiza-
tion, arrangements should be made
by the organization concerned to
recognized differing points of view,
by such means as:

o selecting a single speaker who,
by reason of his training and expe-

. 121 JUL'81

rience, may be expected to present
all relevant consideration in an
unbiased manner;

0 providing different speakers
(at the same or later meetings) to
represent different sides of the
controversy;

0 arranging for a question
period, or by other appropriate
means.

The regulations concur with
provisions of the “Loyalty Oath"
passed by the state legislature and
approved by the chancellor. This
requires the chancellor to certify
V that there are no disloyal or subver-
sive persons in‘ the university's
employ. It would follow that the
university should bar any political
groups which are considered
subversive. '

All this should come as news to,
say, the Progressive Student Net-
work, the Arms Race Study Group.
or any other organization teetering
on the edge of university-defined
subversity. It should also come as
news to everyone else at Pitt
because—and we acknowledge this
as a cheap and sensationalist way
of making a point-these regula-
tions, however true, were iii effect
in 1952 and are now obsolete.

Viewed now, they are senseless
and contrary to the purposes of a

\\\\“

 

university, but at "the time they
were basically unquestioned. In
fact, a committee called the Com-
mittee On Recognition of Student
Organizations (which, by the way,
had only one student representa-
tive) originally denied recognition
to a student Republican Club,
Democratic Club and Progressive
Club.

The absurdity of political and
social attitudes during the '50s is
also effectively chronicled in a doc-
umentary now playing at local
theaters called “The Atomic Cafe."

Children were taught to duck and K

cover, in case of a nuclear war,
using a cartoon turtle as an exam-
ple. Mushroom clouds were aes-
thetically pleasing to military
personnel. Tranquilizers were
recommended to relieve the bore-
dom of a long stay in a fallout shel-
ter. (P.S. The government said they
weren't habit forming.)

It's easy to look back now with a
smug, self—assured attitude. Look
how far we've come in the way we
view things now, especially
nuclear war. What can be more log-
ical than the iiotion of a limited

nuclear war? How more “well pre- «

pared" can we get than to have the
post office ready with emergency
change of address cards following a

nuclear attack on the U.S.? Thank
God bank employees have been
briefed on safeguarding records
and on nuclear war banking
methods. A true measure of our
progress is this: instead of mere
tranquilizers, the government‘ now
stockpiles opium to ease those
post-nuclear jitters.

It's a real comfort to see how
much progress we’ve made.

By scorr REX

E-"'5, While riding the PAT bus on

MP.

the morning after the Steeler
victory over Dallas, I realized
what everybody needs to know
in order to converse in Pitts-
burgh. It is neither the philos-
ophy of Kant nor the basics of
Fortran. What I’m talking
about is football.

Think of the benefits you
would derive from taking an

introduction to football class. i

You would know the difference
between a right guard and a
tight end. You would not feel

Football Class

O

For the students who plan on
moving out of state we could
have upper level footballj This
class would include in—depth
study of what players belong to
what team. If you’re interview-
ing in Houston, you don‘t want
to say, “Coach Phillips really
has those Cowboys at their
peak." Utteringa statement like
that could cost you that job that

you have dreamed of for four-

years.

As students of the University
of Pittsburgh, we realize that
football is the most relevant
subject. One would figure that
since this school places such
importance on the game, it
would also see the benefits we
would derive from taking foot-
ball classes. Isn’t it about time
we had a few football courses?
Maybe Coach Fazio could guest
lecture.

Parties Protested

Dear Editor:

I wish to protest the lax atti-

tude of the campus police in
dealing with unauthorized par-
ties on weekends. It seems that
unless those involved in the
unauthorized celebration are
acting in a violent manner,
nothing will be done to break it
up.’
In addition, those complain-
ingget no results and become
victims of the farce. Often, this
means losing needed sleep due
to the uncontrolled affair.

The people committing the
transgression must be arrested

‘and taken to drunk tanks. It

would also helpgif they were
booked and forced to take a
course in the hazards of drink-
ing alcoholic beverages.
Following this treatment,
they should be put on proba-

tion, either academic or police.
That might get through their
thick skulls.

Furthermore, the dormitory
involved should be forbidden to
have any parties for at least two
months. This ought to be
enforced by Resident Assistants
and Resident Directors alike.

I don't consider this outline
as punishment cruel or unusual
in degree.

With the amount of alcohol
consumed on campus, the RSA
or Student Government must
create an Alcoholic Rehabilita-
tion Program to deal with those
addicts of alcohol.

I am not trying to act like a
dictator but attempting to get a
trend of negative problems
reversed.

Did you know that there are
banana trees growing in Pitts-
burgh? Not only that, but there
are also African Date Palms
sprouting up in a tropical climate

.here in the city. They can be
found growing ‘in the Phipps
Conservatory, located across
from Flagstaff Hill in Schenley
Park. More than 180 varieties of
plants grow year round at the
conservatory, enclosed under
two-and-a-half acres of glass.

Phipps Conservatory was

‘ founded in 1892 by Henry

Phipps, and according to Joe

Martrano, supervisor of mainte-

‘ nance at the conservatory; some

of the trees in the main lobby are

almost as old as thebuilding
itself. 1

One of the major concerns
around the year is the tempera-
ture control of the various
rooms. There‘ are nine houses in
which the ﬂowers grow, so you
can walk from a cool Japanese
garden at 72 degrees and a few
feet away find yourself in a desert
4

climateof 118 degrees. *

The houses are heated by
steam piped in from the Belle-
field Pump House. In case of a
failure of the heating system, the
‘conservatory has two of its own
boilers on hand.

One of the most critical peri-
ods is in the winter when the
temperature drops below zero.
Broken pipes used to be a prob-'

alleviated by a 1979 renovation,
of the ﬂooring and the installa-

system. . I

“Renovation is still taking
place from the ground up,” said
,Martrano. ‘

Air circulation is also impor-
tant in maintaining a; steady
temperature and climate for the
plants. Overhead fans in each of
"the rooms are used in the winter
to keep the warm air moving. In
the summer, the fans keep the
houses cool. The glass roofing
must also be shaded to keep the
sun from penetrating_ directly
overhead.

“It can be tricky,” said ."-‘Ear
trano, “the temperature can be
30 degrees outside. but inside it
Could be as warm as 60 or 70
degrees.” He also recalled a time
in spring when some of the
houses heated up to 130
degrees. ‘

‘ world._

Tropical Plants
in The Big City

The goldfish and lily” ponds

‘that decorate the interior

throughout the conservatory
have circulating pumps to keep
the water fresh and clean.

Phipps Conservatory oper-
ates all year long, with four
annual flower shows that are
viewed by 60,000 to 75,000 peo-
ple over a three week period.
Each of the main rooms has a
theme, and the main theme is
illustrated in the Victoria Room,
the main display room.

Martrano explained that each .

of the ﬂowers in the shows are
started eight months in advance,
which entails spraying, fertiliz-

‘ ing, stacking and tying the flow-

ers as they grow and mature.

In addition, the planning-of the
themes and arrangements of the
exhibitions takes a year to
accomplish. For example, after
this year’s fall ﬂower show, the
1983 fall flower show will be in
the planning stage. And although
late November to early
December may not seem like a
busy time for horticulture, it is
one of the busiest times at
Phipps. I

“We have to move pretty fast
between the time the fall show is
over, strip the exhibits and get
ready for the Christmas show
which starts December 18,”
explained Martrano.

Though Phipps Conservatory’
is well recognized for its fine
flower shows, the city’s parks
depend on the efforts of the peo-
ple at Phipps to grow the 1 10,000
annuals that will be planted
throughout the city.

, The growing and maintaining
of ﬂowers at Phipps Conserva-
tory is an active, 12—months-a-
year occupation, as growing
schedules for the various shows
overlap. However, not all of the
plants at Phipps are domestic
transients. Over the years, many
of the permanent ones have
been imported from all over the

One of the most beautiful gifts to
the city was given by Henry Phipps.
who wrote a'letter to the ma_yor of
Pittsburgh saying “If the citytgrants
me permission, lshall be very glad to
erect a Conservatory in Schenley
Park at a cost of, say $100,000.”

The City of Pittsburgh accepted
the generous offer without qualms
and one of the largest publicly
owned conservatories was built in
Schenley Park across from Flagstaff
Hill for a cost of $110,000. The con-
servatory was opened Dec. 7, 1893.
Although the conservatory origi-
nally consisted of only nine ‘display
houses, Phipps donated three more
in 1896. In 1900, the city invested
$35,000 to build the nine growing
houses, which are still in existence
today.

According to director Edward
Vasilcik, the conservatory must be
renovated every 40~years. It’s pres-
ently undergoing a $6-million reno-
vation project that includes
installation of a drainage system, up-
to-date heating systems, new light-
ing and new paving.

“The new paving system has no
steps so that the conservatory is
completely accessible to the handi-
capped,” said Vasilcik. “Next

summer, the Victoria and Fern
Rooms will be renovated to imitate‘

their original structures. Last time
renovation took place, they were
changed a little,” he said.

The rooms will be completely
rebuilt from the sill line up, and in the
Victoria Room, modern materials
that look like their original counter-
parts will be used. For instance,
stainless steel resembling cast iron
will be used for the supporting ribs.

To facilitate funding for the resto-
ration, a committee for the restora-
tion of the conservatory was formed
in 1974. Vasilcik said that the com-
mittee is “instrumental in helping to

_ get funding from private corpora-

tions. They are a strong thrust in
getting contacts and raising
money.”

The conservatory is ‘tax-
supported, but the. fees collected

from the quarter of a million people

Every spring, fall and Christmas,
ﬂower shows are staged at Phipps
using only material that can be
moved around easily. These shows
are composed entirely°of material
grown on the premises by the
Phipps staff. ‘

The thousands of plants used in
the shows must be timed so that
they are in bloom exactly when they

weather outdoors,

tropical paradise.’

are needed. The setting and back-

grounds used are real. Tons of rock ,

and stone, soil and peat moss must
be in place before the plants may be

moved from the nine greenhouses in I

which they have been grown.

 

A typical growing schedule for a
spring show requires 10,000 tulips,
2,000 . hyacinths, 3,000 narcissi,
2,000 lilies, 500 hydrangeas, 300
begonias, 3,000 primroses, 400 schi-
zanthus, 400 genista, 1,300 calceola—
rias, 1,300 cinerarias, 1,200 azaleas
and much more.

It’s amazing to think that this
amount of flowers and plants is
grown and organized into beautiful
displays by only the 31 staff
members at Phipps.

Because the shows are so compli-
cated, they must be planned an
entire year in advance. Vasilcik does
the planning himself, but occasion-
ally ideas are contributed by staff
members. '

“The people that work here do
things that are unique, like con-
struct and deal with mainly tropical
plants,” Vasilcik said.

He added that “the shows are
interesting because regardless of
the weather outdoors, you’re
always in a tropical paradise.”

Vaslikcik said that the staff, which
is also responsible for the flowers in
all of the city’s parks, works
together in a family atmosphere.

Other people who help at Phipps
are the docents. “They used to help
in the greenhouses, but now they're
pretty much involved,in the educa-
tional aspects of Phipps,” said
Vasilcik.

’ People visiting the conservatory
don’t need to stay indoors to see the
plants and flowers. There is a large
water garden where tropical water
lilies are displayed during the
summer and a large herb garden

M adjacent to the conservatory.

Sometimes people use the con-
servatory for purposes other than
viewing the displays. “The conser-
vatory is available at various times
for simple weddings for under 35
people,” said Vaslicik. Weddings

cannot take place during the ﬂower

shows.  . ..l

“Many college students and
former college students have been
married here, and many people
have their pictures taken here after

y as it did on September 7, I910 when this

they’ve been married elsewhere,”
he said.

. He added that sometimes student
groups also have their pictures
taken in the beautiful settings at
Phipps.

_ In an industrial center such as
Pittsburgh. Phipps helps to meet the
need for beauty. It is for this reason
that the h‘alf~mile of paths wander
through displays which have been
arranged in garden effects or as nat-
ural forested areas. Although the
plants are roughly grouped in taxo-
nomic sequence, more effort is con-
centrated on grouping them so that
they will be pleasing to the eye.

Volunteers G

There’s a lot more to learn about
the plants and ﬂowers in Phipps
Conservatory besides their ‘names.
The docents know the origins of the
plants, their uses and even their pol-
itical implications.

According to volunteer education
coordinator lrene Jacob, there are
some very exciting stories asso-
ciated with plants. She gave the
example of how coffee had to be
almost stolen from Ethiopia (where
it originated) because the Arabs
wanted to monopolize it. Jacob said
that the docents tell these stories
and also “take a plant and explain
where it came from.”

Jacob was a docent at Carnegie
Museum when she decided that a
similar project could be started at
Phipps to educate people about the
plants. The two-and-a-half year old
program now has 45 participants

 

who must enroll in a three month

course taught by Jacob and then
attend monthly continuing educa-
tion classes.

Jacob said that students must
have “a love of plants and a good
way of projecting.” They also must
pass a course exam.

Although docents work on a
volunteer basis, they must pay for
the course and be willing to give at
least one day a week to Phipps. Pub-
lic tours are given Monday through
Saturday at 1 and 2 p.m. Tours for
eight or more people can be
arranged in advance by phone. The
tours last 45 minutes.

Jacob said thatsmost docents
either hold part-time jobs or are still
raising children. She said that col-
lege students might find the pro-

gram difficult to work into their

schedules.

uide Visitors Through

“We had one student from Pitt,
but he dropped out just before the
exam,” she said.

Phipps did not provide the infor-
mation Jacob needed to start the
docent program, but now it does
provide some. Jacob, who is a horti-
culturalist, wrote all of the original
material herself.

In addition to explaining from
where plants came and how they’re
used, the docents point out the influ-
ence of plants on architecture; some
architecture is copied from plants.
For instance, the.Victoria Room at
Phipps utilizes the pattern of radial
ribs seen on the underside of the leaf
of the Victoria waterlily.

The docents also teach the his-
tory of gardens, and a special pro-
gram for 5th and 6th graders is in the
making.

Another program they run is the
program for the blind, in which par-

Cacti are just one‘ of the hundreds of kinds of plants from around the world that can
be segn in Phipps throughout the year. i

ticipants can smell and touch plants,
as well as learn their sounds.

The program includes the out-
door herb garden in the summer,
but during the winter months partic-
ipants can come indoors and learn
about the plants inside. Jacob said
that the ‘program, which is run by
Dolores Peabody, is probably one of
the only ones of its kind in the
country.

According to director Ed Vasilcik,
the docents provide conservatory
visitors with a greater understand-
ing of features they otherwise might

Conservatory

not notice while touring the facility

' on their own.

Perhaps the best reason for insti-
tuting the docent program at Phipps
is that even though Phipps is one of
the largest conservatories in the
nation, there is no botanical depart-

ment at any university in Pittsburgh.

However, Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity’s Hunt Library is one of the best
botanical libraries. ,
Jacob also said she wondered
why university students don’t visit
Phipps more often and take advan-
tage of the resources found there.

The Pitt News, Wednesday September l5#1982

By BR|AN_ BALK

The year of 1982 marked
many changes in Pitt athletics.
A new football coach was hired
and a vice-chancellor became
athletic director.

The most recent change was
the appointment of John Vas-
vary as head coach of the
Panther track and cross country
teams.Vasvary is determined to
bring these programs back into
the limelight. . r“

“It’s not going to be an over-
night process, but my eventual
goal is to build a very strong
running team,” Vasvary said.

Making snap judgements
often results in losses. Vasvary

make decisions based on first
impressions.
““It’s hard for me to make any

knows this, so he’s not about to ‘

type of assessment right now,”
Vasvary said. “As of,now I’m
just going to sit back and look
at the entire team. Then I’ll be
able to get a general idea and go
from there.”

When Ed Bozik, the recently
named athletic director,’ went
searching for a replacement for
Mike Agostinella—who
"resigned in ]uly—he was not
about to settle for a second-rate
coach. Vasvary, 36, has all the
credentials to build-up the
programs.

He began coaching on the
high school level 14 years ago.
He produced 74 Virginia State
Champions ’ and achieved a
winning percentage of .925.

Vasvary then went to the Uni-
versity of Virginia to fill the

vacated assistant coaching posi-
tion. While there he achieved -H
similar results. He took their
womens cross country team to a
National Championship, while
representing the five All-
America honors along the way. ~

Like many coaches, the sport
is built into him. His running
career began in the seventh
grade. After high school, he
went on to run the half mile and
mile at Virginia Tech. There,
he compiled several records and
served as team captain.

“I’m very impressed with
Pitt’s athletic department,"
Vasvary said. “The entire
department seems to operate in
a very professional manner-
Definitely first class.

“Pitt has a great track and

field tradition," he continued.
“Runners such as Dwayne
Woodruff—-who won a gold
medal in the Olympics-
attended here. The tradition

,will really help build up the a

program.”
Many members of the
Panther cross country team

have already noticed the vast
differences between coaching
attitudes and viewpoints. The
general consensus is that Vas-
vary’s appointment is a change
for the better. But Vasvary once
again emphasized that rebuild-
ing Pitt’s somewhat crumbled
track and cross country pro-
grams will not take place
overnight.

“I just want every runner to
get better with each race he

Vasvary Becomes Panther Track Coach

runs. He doesn’t have to
improve his time, hejust has to
better understand his event. I
just want everyone to continue
to learn.”

Vasvary is presently looking
for a home around the area so he
can bring up the team’s “three
greatest fans” hisfamily.

“I already bought Pitt but-
tons and shakers,” he said, and
they already know most of the
members of the team. It’s really
great forthe team to get to know
the family because they will be
their biggest fans always.”

Although the cross country
season has begun, Vasvary is
not about to hurry into compe-
tition. As he put it, “We’re not
going to war until we're
armed.”

Julie Gaul led the Lady Panther volleyball team over Robert Miorriisliast night. i 2

Marino Has Capable Backups

By DALE MOORE

There is a common bond shared
by Pitt students these days. It's not
the rising cost of tuition, the
depressed economy or even the new
dorm party policy.

The uniting factor has to do with
the welfare of a member of the stu-
dent body. Everyone concerned
about one student? Yes, a student
named Dan Marino.

Such concern is not for unselfish
reasons. There seems to be a major-
ity of people who think,'even after
his performance against North
Carolina, that he is the man who
can bring the elusive national title
back to Pitt.

True, one man does not make a
team, but as far as most fans are
concerned, without Danny Marino
at quarterback, Pitt’s chances of
winning the title are about as good
as finding a job in Homestead.

Although such thoughts are con-
sidered blasphemous, assume
Marino gets hit by a 275 lb. side of
beef. Marino’s out cold. What now?
Cancel the season due to lack of
interest?

Believe it or not, Marino isn't the
only quarterback on the Pitt roster.

Waiting in the wings are John.

Cummings and Danny Daniels.
Some Pitt fans may remember

remember 15 that he went the entire
game withoutcompleting a pass-~
not a comforting thought.

Here, the story takes a strange
turn. Daniels, a two-time letterman
with some experience is no the
backup quarterback. He lost that
job this fall to John Cummings, a
6-2, 190 lb. sophomore from Mont-
clair, N.]., who appears to be the
heir to the throne after Marino
graduates.

Although unproven in regular
season action, Cummings has
shown promise. But enough to fill
the shoes of Marino, if required?
Perhaps not, but who says they
need to be filled completely? With
all of Pitt’s other assets, an All-
America quarterback may not be
necessary.

As demonstrated by the perfor-
mance against the Tar Heels and
the acclaimed Kelvin Bryant, the
stingy defense is in top form. It may
not take many points to win.

So the next time Marinoigets
sacked, don't immediately cancel
those Sugar Bowl reservations.

' Give the defense a shot.

Volleyball Team
Preparing For

Upcoming Matches  

By SCOTT DELLETT And MARK A.
SINDLER
After a highly competitive

tournament—the Cleveland State
Invitational—the Pitt Lady Pan-
ther volleyball team needed an easy
home match, one that they would
not have to worry about winning
or losing. This in light of the even-

tual goal——becoming a top team in

the East.

The Robert Morris Lady Colon-
ials last night proved to be the easy
opponent for the Lady Panthers, as

Pitt won by scores of 15-4, 15-0 and

15-7.

It was apparent to the small
group of onlookers at the Fitzge-
rald Field House that the Lady
Panthers were the dominant team
from the first serve to the last spike.
-Pitt was bigger, stronger and more
team-oriented squad.

Dan Marino

Head coach Sheldon Collier said

he used the match to work on"

improving the serve.

“This team has a lot of things to
work on,” Collier said. “We need
to serve consistently tough, hard
serves. This was one of our
objectives——not to serve the easily
returnable serve and to hit the ball
so the other team has a hard time
returning the shot.”

Collier also wanted to improve
on other aspects of the game.

“I think we needed to use these
matches to work on our blocking
and defense,” he said. '

The match was also a tune-up

for Saturday night’s encounter-
with Rutgers, one of the top teams .

in the East. Collier describes the
upcoming match as one of the bet-
ter rivalries in women’s volleyball.

Krug Lands More

By SEAN BARNES

When Pitt's head diving
coach, Julian Krug, told me last

' April that he would rebuild the

Panther diving team from one
diver to seven or eight, I wished
_him luck for the summer
Four divers I could imagine,
but when September rolled
around, coach Krug had kept
his promise five freshmen and
one transfer diver-joined Rex
Nordheimer, giving Pitt the
potential to regain its Eastern
diving dominance.
“I had two new men already
before school let out last year,”
said Krug both did work with
me over the summer gaining
the much needed one-meter col-
lege polishing while achieving
the necessary three-meter back-
ground that all incoming fresh-
"men have little or no experience
-on.” V
Freshman John Dusch from
Taylor Alrderdice, a City
League school in Pittsburgh,
displayed his ability to quickly
learn some very tough three-
meter dives He learned the tri-
ple twisting one-and-one-half,
a full twisting two—and-one-.
half and a three-and-one-half
off the three-meter board early
enough to put him in the com-
. petition at the Senior National
Prequalification meet this past
summer. This was his first
three-meter competitive
,I\J:tformance.
- “John represented some good
rough talent,” said Krug “His
tenth place on the one-meter
board at States and his thirtieth
out of 45 finish at the Senior
National Prequal meet has me
thinking of how far he can go
_with facilities like we have here,
versus the City League
facilities.”

The Pitt News, Wednesday September 15, "I982,

Than His Share Of Divers «

Another quick—to-learn
recruit, who also joined before
the summer, is Mark McCor-
mick. Like Dusch, McCormick
completed his three-meter list
in less than one summer.
“Mark's a very steady learner
and has the diving strength and
body to command respect,” said
Krug, ‘s‘A little bit of work on
technique with smoothness and
I foresee quite a champion in
the future.”

McCormick finished his high
school career ‘with a second at

_WPIAL and third at States,

leaving little doubt in the accu-
racy of Krug’s predictions.

These two men, coupled with
Nordheimer, could compete in
a college meet today if they had
to. Nortdheimer has shown sig-
nificant improvement in both
his list of dives and their
execution.

“I got a chance to coach a
diving team this past summer,"
said Nordheimer. “It was an
emotional boost more than any-
thing to see kids anywhere from
seven to eight learn tough dives
and then compete with them. It
forced me to keep on my toes
and look very hard at dives that
always seemed basic. I'm sure it
will reward me well this
season.”

Krug is noticing Nordhei-
mer’s improvement already.
“He’s doing the best diving I’ve
ever seen him do, and we still
have eight weeks until our first
dual meet.”

Another freshman, Todd
Muldet, from Bethlehem, Pa., is
behind in training compared to
his three teammates lready
mentioned; He heard of Pitt’s
program while at state finals
where he finished tenth. It was
not hard for Muldet to hear
about Krug’s program; all five

Tennis Team
Needs Depth

By TIM DINGER

T-he Lady Panther tennis team
will bring a lot of experience back
ttilthe courts this year in hopes of
improving last year’s 1-l0 record.
Despite a rocky first—year, George
Dieffenbach goes into his second
season as tennis coach with a fair
amount of optimism.

“Our goal is to break the .500
mark for a winning season,” Dief—
fenbach said. _ .

Leading the way to a winning
season will be last year’s leading
player, senior Cathy Jacobson. Jac-
obson, along with the now-
graduated Randi Belkin, placed
sixth at last year’s Eastern competi-
tion at New Paltz, N.Y.

Other seniors on the roster are
Beth Baughman and Lisa Lafuria.
Baughman was Pitt’s No. 6 singles
player and on the No. 3 doubles
team with junior Jody Matt1O1-
Lafuria was Pitt’s No. 3 player two

years ago, but an illness sidelined
her for the 1981-82 season.

Other returners are juniors Terri
White and Lynn Aranson and
sophomore Miriam Aranson.

Adding depth to the lineup are
newcomers Linda Stadler, who
played on the Lady Panther volley-
ball team last year, and freshmen
Kristine Peckman, Patty Pikunas
and Susan Robbins.

Although Dieffenbach admits
the team still needs to improve its
depth and teamwork in doubles
play, he is generally pleased with
this year’s outcome. _

The Lady Panthers start their
season with two local trips. On
Sept. 20, they travel to Carnegie-
Mellon to play the Tartans at 4
"pm. and on Sept. 22, they visit
Duquesne for a 3 p.m. match. The
home opener is Sept. 23, when
Robert Morris visits the Trees
courts for a 4 p.m. match.

Panther Soccer Team Defeats Grove City  

By LISA GREN EVICKI

The Pitt Panther soccer team
found that winning touch, defeat.
mg Grove City on Saturday 3-0,

Junior Matt Engle, playing in

aliis first game as a Panther, scored

two goals for the Pitt booters,
Engle had injured his ankle before
the season opened, but was able to
play and ignite the Pitt offense,
which had been absent in the first
two games of the season.

Senior tri-captain John Hagen-
buch also contributed to the_sror-
ing, booting one goal in the net.

Pitt and Grove City played to a
scoreless first half, but the Panthers
were tough when they found their
scoring‘ touch.

“It was a good team effort,” said

Pitt Head Coach Leo Bemis. “We ‘

played quite_well. We had good
ball control and executed well."
The Panther defense once again
started the season off tough, leav-
ing the Grove City squad scoreless.

Pitt got fine performances from
sophomore Jeff Dunn and fresh-
men Brian Casey and Mike Russell
in the defense. But Bemis insisted it
was a total team effort.

“Our defense played well,”
Bemis said, “they did what they
had to do. But everyone contrib-
uted. It was a team victory."

Tonight, the Pitt booter’s hope to
continue their winning ways in
their home opener against St. Vin-
cent. Game time is 7:15 p.m. at Pitt
Stadium.

o

The Panthers beat St. Vincent 3-
1 last season in a hard-fought
battle.

Senior. Eric Tiedtke scored two
goals in last year’s contest, as the
team's scoring leader. Bemis
believes the addition of Erigle to
the scoring ranks should benefit

' the team up front.

Although the Panthers have had

‘an easy time with St. Vinent in

recent years, Bemis is planning on

a tough match.

America’s diplomatic, consular, commercial, and overseas
cultural and information services are seeking qualified can-
didates, especially women and minority group members. The
Department of State and the other Foreign Affair§\_Agencies
are strongly concerned about diversifying the Foreign Ser-
vice and making it more representative of the American
population. American diplomats are serving their country in
230 missions throughout the world in administrative, con-
sular, political, economic, commercial and information /
cultural functions. Salaries range from $17,992 to $36,475.

If you are interested in a challenging career, apply to take
this year’s Foreign Service exam which will be held on
December 4, 1982. Application forms, which must be sub-
mitted by October 22, may be obtained by writing: FSO

“I don’t expect a push-over,”
Bemis said. “Last year, St. Vincent
finished with a winning season.

Bemis hasn’t seen St. Vincent as
of yet this season, but he knows
what to expect from this league foe.

“They play a trapgame, using
long kicks and they like to put pres-
sure _on your backs,”. Bemis
explained. “They’ll be very aggres-
sive. That’s their style gf play,"

And a victory in their home
opener is Pitt’s style of play.

serious enough to keep them out of
Saturday’s game at Florida State.

Bryan Thomas suffered a bruised
shoulder and should miss practice
for three or four days. Other injur-
ies include Rich Kraynak, John
Brown (both with shoulder
sprains) and Troy Hill (bruised

Remember when Bill Currie was

Remember him? He’s the person
who called the Panther basketball

beat Pitt 82-77 at Morgantown. A

Catlett is still upset over Pitt’s

By BRIAN BALK

After what transpired last Thurs-
day night many disheartened
Panther fans were searching for
trash bins to discard their once-
treasured season tickets. It was evi-
dent that fans were disappointed
with the Panthers’ performance.

After the game, a caller on the
Panther post—game show wondered
why the Pitt fans were upset. The
caller, who's from Northwestern
University, said, “At Northwestern
we are overjoyed when our team
wins any game, anyhow. But you
guys gripe and complain when you
win.”

Northwestern has not won a
football ‘game in 33 consecutive
games.

drive will be met with more cau-

Three years ago, during the She-
rill dynasty, the Panthers were in
the same preseason situation. They
were sitting on the peak of almost
every conceivable poll in the land,
and it seemed as if nothing could
dampen their spirits. The first few
match-ups resulted in total
Panther blow-outs; and the confi-
dence grew.

The next opponent on the
Panthers’ schedule was a diminu-
tive Florida_ State squad. The
Panthers, as well as the majority of
fans, assured themselves of a vic-
tory even before the plane took off
for Tallahassee. However their
overconfidence finally caught up
with them, their composure fell
and their dignity as well as their

panther fans were expeeting winning streak-were destroyed. All

of the most intense in women's vol-
leyball. Their main strength is
their fast, deceptive offense with
quick sets and patterns,” com-
mented Collier. i

“Rutgers and_Pitt are always in
the"to‘p three in the East and it
should be the same way this year.”

The Lady Panthers came back
the next morning to host the Pitt
Preview, a round-robin tourna-
ment which gives five teams an
opportunity to gain some game
experience.

“We used the tournament to get
some playing time and to gain con-
fidence," Collier said. “We have
some young players that haven't
played that much and I’m trying to
get them some game experience--
both as individuals and as a team.”

Rutgers, Kent State, Slippery
Rock and Indiana of Pennsylvania
will be participating in the Pitt
Preview.

Lady Panther co-captain Julie
Gaul is looking forward to the
tournament this weekend.

“I think this weekend will give

us a chance for better competi-
tion," Gaul said. “No matter what
the outcome, it will prepare us for
the season."

As far as the progress so far this

season, both Collier and Gaul
agree that the team needs
improvement.

“As a coach, I feel that the team is
never as far as I like it to be,” Col-
lier said. “When we met one chal-
lenge, there is another one to
conquer.” ‘

“I think we are on track, but we

have a lot of work to do,” Gaul

GRADUATING A

SENIORS

The UNIVERSITY PLACEMENT SERVICE will hold briefing orientations for SENIORS AND GRADUATE
STUDENTS who will graduate in DECEMBER 1982, APRIL, JUNE, AND AUGUST 1983 on the following
dates. The purpose of these meetings is to. explain the functions of the Placement Service, to
distribute information about campus interviews, and to prepare students for their own job search.

said.

Both have similar goals for the
team.

“Last year we finished ninth at
Nationals," Collier said. “This
year we have some big shoes to fill.
We-‘have to work our hardest in
practice and games in order to
achieve our goals.”

East championships and to "beat
some big name teams in order to
get a berth in the NCAA’s,” Gaul
said.

Big name teams like Ohio State
and Penn State. '

“They are our biggest matches of
the year," Collier said. “These
matches should give us an early
season test.”

In the Cleveland State Invitatio-
nal,Loyola proved to be the only
roadblock in the team's path as it
registered 15-6, 14-16, 10-15 tallies.
After that, it was an easy sprint all
the way. Central Michigan fell 15-
9, 15-5, as did Northern Michigan,
15-3 and 15-1. The Lady Panthers
then encountered Cleveland State
and finished it off, 15-9, 15-13.

The semifinals were next.
Although not as convincingly as at
their first meeting, the'Lady Pan-
thers did manage to outduel Cleve-
land State, 15-1, 13-15, 16-14. The
finals only saw coach Shelton Col-

lier's squad rollover Central Mich-
igan, 9-15, 15-8, 15-3, 15-12.

As can be expected, Collier
couldn’t be more impressed over
his team's performance. V

“We won the overall tournament
in light of my fielding a team that
is starting out with many question
marks,” Collier said. “This is par-
ticularly true of Ulana Kohutiak,
who turned in an outstanding
tournament; she improved every
aspect of her game and is on the
verge of becoming an all-collegiate
player.”

Senior Julie Gaul joined Kohu-
tiak in evening all-tournament
selections.

Before they could claim such
honors, the Lady Panthers had to
recover from the opening night’s
loss. '

“The first night’s loss wasgood
for us,” Collier said. “The girls
were apprehensive and tentative at
the time and their playing together
for the first time was really
exploratory.

“The true durability showed,
though, when we went on to win
five straight matches. Another
major accomplishment for us was
our coming from behind, 8-14, and
beating Cleveland State, 16-14. We
were written off then, but fought
back with great determination and
made an unbelievable comeback.”
