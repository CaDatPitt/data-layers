Pitt Food Service employees claim it’s

comnion knowledge ’that”blacks’ are not  ’

allowed in Pitt’s Faculty Club.

“This is an old fact... they don’t care for
blacks to be up there working,” a Pitt Food
Service employee said.

Other workers agreed.

“Yeah, I’ve heard that. I heard that they

frown on black people and women 
Anyone that you see out there [in the cafe-
teria] will talk to you [about discrimina-
tion,” a Pitt Food Service employee said.

A Pitt manager says ‘he doesn’t know of
any incidents of discrimination at the facul-
ty club.“We have a variety of nationalities
working up there. [There is no discrimina-

Manager Jim Jenkins said. i '

Jenkins said he felt the accusation was
not justified. _ , _  ,_
“"mere’s" no truth in“ that at all,” Jenkins
said.

However, Jenkins said he doesn’t know
anything about club membership.
“Certainly, membership, which is run by
the university, I don’t think is based on dis-
crimination,” Jenkins said.

The Faculty Club had-no comment at

press time.

Some workers said the problem is not
conﬁned to the Faculty Club, but is a prob-
lem all over campus.

said. V

A Food Service Union representative said

“They have told me that, and that may
be true. I don’t know it personally,” Union
Secretary Billy Joe Jordan said.

“I keep hearing this from workers. You
know in America there is a lot of discrimi-

Jordan said.

University
committee
discusses
budgetary
policies

By Beth Kovaly
Staff Writer

Rebuilding trust in the uni-

versity’s budget policy deci— ‘

sions is on the top of the
agenda for the Senate Budget
Policies Committee.

The committee continued

‘discussion on an upcoming

document, which will redefine
the university’s budget policy
decision—making process, at a
meeting last Friday.

Co—chair of the committee,
Edward Symons, said the doc-
ument is needed to clearly
define the BPC’s position in
budget and policy decisions
and to integrate the universi-
ty’s faculty and staff into these
issues.

“The wording in chapter
one of the document is with
respect to how the faculty
members of the university
planning and budgeting com-
mittee are to be identified or
selected. In our meetings with
the chancellor and the provost
last spring we agreed that
these faculty members would
be jointly appointed. We were
told recently that it’s no
longer certain that the line
will be satisfactory to some
people. We’re not clear. What
is clear is that I think the sen-

Violence is not the answer to
African—American' students’
problems, former Black Action
Society chair Douglas Guy told
students at the BAS’s Indaba
 Friday. evening.

 “We must help demonstrate
‘, that violent, aggressive behav-
ior is never an acceptable tool
3 , for solving problems in soci-
_‘,~lety,” Guy, older brother of cur-
 __ rent BAS president Marcus Guy,
 said. , .
According to Guy, black on
‘ black crime is the most serious
" . failure of the black community.
Guy said. that black males
make up 44 percent of the
prison population but only six
percent of the general popula-
tion.
' ‘V-\ “Our goal is to turn this situa-
tion around by the year 2000,”
he said.

Guy proposed a plan called
Target 2025 which calls for the
end of uneducated children,
unemployment and low self-
esteem by the year 2025.

According to Guy, the black
high school dropout rate is
between 40 to 60 percent each
yean

He encouraged older stu-
dents to provide a leadersip
role for younger students to
help them stay in school.

“You are the black, cultural
elite. You are the ones that are
inheriting the destiny of the
21st century,” Guy said.

Guy also said that black
males earn 47 percent of their
white male counterparts’
income.

He said it is important for
black students to learn the
tools and methods of manage-
ment.

As part of Target 2025, Guy
said that church affiliation as

well as education is needed for
the black community to reach
its goall

Some other speakers at the_
Indaba_ included members of
the BAS and Pitt faculty.

The Indaba was part of Get
Acquainted Weekend, spon-
sored by the BAS. Other events
that took place over the week-
end included a dance after the
Indaba and a picnic on Sunday.

“I thought it went very well. I
think we got the messagevout
— black people coming togeth-
er, it’s community time — I
think we got that out,” BAS
Public Relations Chair Vanessa
Liles said.

BAS Membership Chair
Andrew George said, “At the
Indaba itself, students had a
chance to really learn. Overall,
I think it went really, well. A lot 5
of freshmen as well as upper-
classmen got to meet each

Animal rights activists who were protest-
ing in front of Presbyterian University
Hospital on Friday found themselves to be
the object of a protest.

Those in need of transplants criticized
the activists for choosing to save animals
over human lives.

Robert Winter told the animal activists
he has a liver disease. Dana Dripps—Gray
told them he is waiting for a liver trans-
plant.

Winter said he would do anything to get
a liver if he found out he needed one.

“If [a baboon liver] was the only option I
had down the road, I’d want it there and
I’d want it available. And I’d probably give
everything I owned to get one,” Winter
said.

“I need a liver, I'll take one that works,”
Dripps—Gray said.

Winter carried signs reading SORRY MR.
JOHN DOE AND FAMILY, NOT ALL PITTS-
BURGHERS ARE IGNORANT, and FREAK
SHOW.

Winter yelled toward the animal rights
activists, “You’d save a baboon to kill a
baby.”

An animal activist said it was unethical to
capture animals and take their organs.

Activists find themselves the object of protest outside Presbyterian hospital.

“Isn’t that what you’re doing with a
baboon? [Taking their organs] without their
permission?” the activist asked.

“Mr. Perdue and his chickens don’t have
heart-to-heart talks either,” Dripps—Gray
said.

Members from People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals and CRY OUT! ACT
UP held signs saying “PRIMATES CAN

AND HUMANS BOTH VICTIMS.”

“I’m here because I don’t believe in
using a baboon in place of a human life. I
don’t think that a baboon’s life is any less
valuable,” animal rights activist Caroline
Hastings said.

An activist said money should be used to
prevent these diseases that cause someone
to need this type of last minute operation.

Pitt students who are interested in‘

part-time employment, or those seek-
ing internships or jobs after gradua-

_ tion, can find help in the “job—hunt” at

the Student Employment Placement
Center.

Though most of the jobs pay mini-
mum wage, placement intern Patrick
Boyle said he encourages students to
look at job-searching as more than a

f Xsource of gaining money.

 

Having a job in relation to your area
of study in college is very beneficial,
according to Boyle.

“Undergraduates can start to gain
experience related to their majors and
prepare for their job search following
graduation,” Boyle said.

The Student Employment Office
receives calls from all around the
Pittsburgh area. Jobs are offered on-
and off-campus. Part-time jobs range
anywhere from 12-20 hours a week
and summer employment positions
offer up to 40 hours a week.

No appointment is necessary and
guidelines for using the Student
Employment Service are fairly simple.

Students fill out an application on
their first visit to the Student
Employment Office and must present
a current, validated ID. card or a. pink
registration form. 1

Students also have the option of
using the Employment Bulletin‘ Board,
located outside of Room 224 in the
William Pitt Unionf If a student is
interested in any of the jobs listed on’
the board, he or she must give the job
number to one of the Student
Employment Office counselors.‘

Counselors, in turn, write referrals
for the students. Students are then
asked to call the employer and set up
an interview. Once a student is hired,
he or she must report back to the

Student Employment Office. Boyle.

said that this is to keep the service up
to date for other students using the
service.

According to Julia Laird, coordinator
of the Student Employment Placement
Service,‘ approximately 5,000 Pitt stu-
dents register for the service per year.
Registration begins Aug. 1.

Employers usually start calling the
Student Employment Office to notify
them of available jobs around the end
of August, Laird said. The majority of
the job offerings are posted when the

‘fall semester begins, she said.

9 Other services offered by the

Student Employment Office include

interviewing strategies and organizing
resumes.

Counselors are also available to help
students discover where their interests
and skills lie an_d how they can apply
them in their jobs. , ’

Laird said that the Student
Employment Placement Service should
not be confused with the work-study
program, which is handled by the
financial aid department in Bruce Hall.

If having a job seems to conflict
with study time, Laird has observed
from students’ past experiences of jug-

gling both work and classes that the

two actually benefit from each other.
“It helps them to gain a discipline of
balancing time, “ Laird said.
During the school year, the Student
Employment Office hours

UPM C ’s Sports Institute
opens Saturday clinic

By Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief

This is the season for twisted ankles,
knees and shoulders as the high
school fall sports season begins. For
the injured athlete, the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center’s Sports
Medicine Institute is offering a special
clinic on Saturday mornings. 1

The Acute Sports Injury Clinic, in its
third year, opened on Aug. 22, the first
week of the fall sports season. Its
hours are from 9:30 a.m. to noon.

“‘A lot of the" kids arekidslthat we

work with in the schools that we con-

. tract our athletic training services,” a

trainer at the clinic Larry J. Grollman
said. “We work with 15 different high
schools in the greater Pittsburgh area.”

The clinic is open during the fall
because of the. football season, with its
high number of injuries. The seasons
for soccer, tennis, cross country, golf
and volleyball are also at this time of
the year. ’

“We want it to be sports-related
injuries and acute, meaning that it’s
usually an injury that occurs within a
couple days,” Grollman said.
“Someone that has a chronic problem
over years or months we would refer
to our general physician office. Early
Saturday was chosen because a larger
percentage of high school games are
on Friday.

“All too often there area lot of Friday
evening football games and also some

soccer games and as a result, the ath-
letes will wait until Monday to see a

doctor if they suffer an acute injury,”

Grollman said.

The clinic normally sees a lot of
lower extremity injuries, like knees
and ankles. They also get shoulder
injuries, fractures, broken fingers and
wrists. On staff is a physician, Dr.
David Stone, the clinic’s medical direc-
tor, plus an X—ray technologist and a
staff of athletic trainers.

“Our clinic provides a better alterna-
tive than a hospital emergency room,
which may not be adequately
equipped or staffed to appropriately
assess and treat acute sports injuries,”
Stone said.

“Instead of a patient being directed
to an emergency room, they could
come in to our facility and see one of
our sports medicine doctors versus
going for an ankle sprain to an emer-
gency room and then lpeing referred to
a sports medicine doctor on Monday,
they can come right in," Grollman
said.

The clinic charges a visitation fee. X-
rays and other things,‘ like crutches,
are extra, but the clinic does accept
insurance. It is open until Nov. 14.

“I just want to stress that if anybody
feels they should go to an emergency
room, go to an emergency room. But
if it is something like an ankle sprain
and it’s not too bad and they want to
be seen right away, this would be a
good option,” Grollman said.

‘the program this year. Nineteen of
‘those students, are National Scholarship

winners. _

The program pays for 80 percent or
$8,000 of the student's tuition and $400
for books._

Cadet Lieutenant Colonel Sharon
Debbage said, “I have been here four
years, I have watched_ [the program]
progress a great deal. I do not think we
have ever had a better battalion.”

Debbage said that when she was a

National Scholarship winners.

“ROTC does not exist at the universi-
ties to put military presence on campus,
it exists to put the campus presence in
the military,” Cassetori said.

Cassetori said that there is nothing
like a civilian education in a military
environment, because it opens your
mind. ~ a

“Our cadets come to us with their
problems. We try to leadthem in the
right direction,” Ertman said.

According to Cassetori, the ROTC pro-

gram will certainly abide by the
,j..C.hancellor’s. rational .nondiscr_imi_nation ,

policy decision-. “We here do not set
policy.’ We are obligated to follow the
Department of Defense policy. Do not
make us pay for the policy that we are
unable to control. '

“We are here through invitation. We
did not force ourselves on
University of Pittsburgh. We are certain-
ly satisfied with peaceful coexistence,”
Cassetori said. “People have to realize
that this ROTC program provides a lot
benefits_back into this school,” he said.

Debbage said that with all of the ben-
efits the program provides it is a shame
that Pitt is one of the last schools in the
area with a big ROTC program.

residence halls overlook-
ing Schenley Quad were
drawn to their windows
by the sounds of the Pitt
band kicking off the first
Pep Rally of the ‘92-’93
school year.

The Thursday evening
rally began with the Pitt
band’s rendition of the
Victory Song to rile up the
crowd for the evening’s
activities. Spirit continued
to grow as the crowd
grew larger.

Pitt Athletic Director

Oval Jaynes said the Pitt _

football team and tradition
belongs to the students. “I
wish we could fill up the
stadium with students and
alumni alone.”
Cheerleaders taught the
crowd of students the
cheers for the game.
“Having more Pep
Rallies is a wonderful idea.
It is about time we had

. them. It brings out a huge,

excited crowd that helps
build spirit for our
school,’-’ Pitt cheerleader
Kristen Schake said.‘

Quarterback Alex Van, A \

Pelt spoke of West

Virginia’s hate of Pitt.’

Todd Cable, the represen-
tative of the Pitt Program
Council and the organizer
of the Pep Rally, wel-
comed Pitt head coach
Paul Hackett and several
of the players to the Pep
Rally. Hackett read a

_ poem he had received

from John Matchik from
Wimber, Pa. It was a
salute to the Pitt Football
program and its fans.

After he stepped off the
stage, Hackett said “this is
dynamite but we have to
get more people out
here!”

“It’s great having the
fans make an effort to
come out and cheer us on.
It really builds up your
confidence and makes you
play extra hard,” Pitt start-
ing running back Curtis
Martin said.

“I really hope the spirit
continues,” first-year stu-
dent Emily London said.

-Before the festivities
began, MC of the rally,
Debz Kavaler, saidthat
they expected a low
turnout at the rally
because of fraternity and
sorority Rush events that
were also taking place that
evening.

“I anticipate a successful
year in terms of spirit.
We expect the spirit to rise
as the year progresses,”
Kaval.er said.

willing to play a lesser role in
the selection of the faculty
representatives,” Symons said.

The document has been
under construction since Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor came to the univer-
sity, according to Symon. The
most recent draft was pub-
lished in the University Times

 fast May.

In discussing the need for
the written procedure, he

recalled the vote of no—confi—‘

dence given to former Pitt
president Wesley Posvar by
the Faculty of Arts and
Science department chairs
shortly before Posvar left the
university.

“The reason [FAS] did that
was because faculty had no
input in the budget system,
and they didn’t have any
input into the budget system
because there really was no
budget system.

“Because of the history of

\ ' this place under Posvar, there

is a sense of mistrust of the
budgeting and planning deci-
sion-making process.

"One way to start_ to gain,
trust is to have a system you.
can trust. One way to have a
system you can trust is to;
have the faculty haye a sub-
stantial capability to identify
with faculty members in the
decision-lmiaking system,”

one part of the planning and
budgeting document: an
overview of budget process
reform, long-range planning,
operational planning and
evaluation/integration.Chairs
for the committees were pro-
posed, as well as which mem-
bers would serve on each
committee.

Symons said he felt the
smaller committees would be
more productive in gener-
ating creative ideas as well as
‘involving faculty and staff.
“The fact of the matter is a
lot of faculty say ‘if I can’t be
part of shaping the future
of my own activities, then
I’m going to find my own
life.’ .

The whole idea of this is to
have faculty be in a situation
where they feel they have
some control over their des-
tiny, some input as to what
their work is. g

“I am personally convinced
that the most creative work is
done in small groups.

"The people in the engi-
neering school [for example]
know far more about how to

spend the budget of the engi- I

neeringschool than anybody
in central administration.

"The central administration
should be integrating the cre-
ative plans of the smallest
units,” Symons said.

The committee will meet

“I think the shop stewards

the workload is different. The

upset about it  They got to
understand that when you
make a transition like this

One food service employee .

said a lot of the confusion at
the meeting was the result of
allegations that Marriott was
going to force the older
workers. out and replace
them with younger people, at
lower wages.

“There’S a bunch of things
like that I heard, but how
true they are I don’t know,”

she was told by a Marriott

“I find out that [the food
pans are] going up to the

. posed to have cooks up

Jenkins said.
Jenkins said the problems

are a result of adapting to the

changes.

“We went from the Same
thing on all the lines to dif-
ferent formats on all the
lines. What are we doing?
We’re challenging the
kitchen. We’re challenging
these people to do things
they’ve never done before,”
Jenkins said.

Jenkins said the result will
be an improved cafeteria ser-
Vice.

“We got a great program
for Pitt  different concepts
and formats. We’re challeng-
ing people. We’re trying to
bring the best we can bring
to the University of
Pittsburgh,” Jenkins said.

The Marriott managers said
things have to change
because they have a different
system than Daka
Corporation, the previous

' food service manager.

“I don’t know all of the rea-
sons why Pitt decided to go
out on the‘ bid. But certainly
they" felt tl1at_Ma~rriott had a

better system "of ‘management F

control than Daka would
have had,” Jenkins said.

“The school must have felt
‘the previous system was
unsatisfactory, or else we
wouldn’t be here,” Marriott

by Marriott.

“We’re not holding any-
body’s pay. It’s processing
time  people coming in, it’s
a late cycle. Yes it’s almost
two weeks ‘til you get your
first check. But you're getting
paid every week from there
on in,” Jenkins said.

“There’s no other way. It’s
the way our company is.
That’s the way it is world-
wide. It’s no different at the
University of Pittsburgh than
it is at the College of William
and Mary,” Jenkins said.

“We have 486 contracts in
colleges and ungiversities 
Wherever we go, at the very
beginning they have this-
assumption that we are hold-
ing their money. We are not,"
Mahini said.

Jenkins said the time cards
are sent from Pitt to Marriott
where the pays are tabulated.
Then paychecks are printed
and sent back to Pitt.

“The process of issuinga
check from this location, to
go through the mail and
come back, takes nine days,
and if a person has started on

'”'tl1’e” first day ‘of '21‘ ‘pay’ period ’

Bushenomics  

In 1984, Ronald Reagan made a successful re-election
; bid. Throughout that campaign, chants of “four more
years” and';‘“{Re-elect Ron” were not uncommon. After
all, President‘ Reagan, it was thought, helped to restore
this country to the levels of greatness it had enjoyed in
the 1950’s. The economy was strong and much of the
world was looking to us for guidance.
~\‘But now it. is 1992 and the mood is different. Our
attention can no longer be diverted by the ideological
rhetoric about the “Evil Empire,” or the liberal, democ-
ratic establishment. George Bush has to start answering
some real questions. The voters in 1984 asked Ronald
Reagan for “four more years.” If Bushlgets. re—elected
it’s not going to be because the voters wanted four
more years of the same, but because Bush convinced
them to give him one more chance.

-The first place to start, according to a recent poll in
USA Today, is the economy. And it is for good reason.
The value of a dollar has declined to early 1970’s lev-
els, the gap between rich and poor has grown at an
alarming rate, and the rises in GNP have slowed signif-

, gcantly. '
A Despite all of these difficulties, President Bush holds
strong to the notions that the difference between eco-
nomic growth and stagnation lies in a few tax cuts --
and that these tax cuts will spur the owner cla‘ss..to
‘ invest more. This is the same policy that the last three
j administrations have been preaching for the past 12
V.) years and the results are hardly anything to brag about.
There is little reason to believe that the results of his
new plan would be different. Even Bush’s own Chief

Economic Advisor, as reported’ by the New Yorle Times,

Michael Boskin stated that proposed capital gains cut

failed because of Congress. Bush’s program is ﬂawed.
"Rich Americans do not necessarily re—invest their
wealth in labor, machinery and ‘equipment. They may
consume and speculate or invest in capital assets.

The key for Bush is to start looking at the most pre-
cious resource we have —- our own people.
Investment in human beings has always proven suc-
cessful. One only has to look at the gap between
workers who have college degrees and those who do
not; and countries with strong training programs like

‘Erermany and Japan and those, like the United States,
that do not.

George Bush has a lesson to learn. It’s kind of ironic
that, in the end, he could look to that evil- empire for
an answer. The Soviet Union’s inﬂuence crumbled
abroad because it collapsedat home. The same thing
is happening here. Let’s look for those answers at
home, and let’s start with our own people.

Porn and men: the naked truth

Picture this: On the third day
of the new school term men

lined up outside of _Gus7 Miller’s
News Stand, just ‘off the Pitt‘

campus, to buy and later con-
sume the October issue of
Playboy, featuring the so-called

“‘Girls’ of the Big East.” (For '

the record, the “girls” are actu-
ally adults and therefore.
women.) Some of the men.
looked excited, others surpris-

ingly timid. Most all looked. like ..

“regular” collegelguys and, for. "

the most part, they came with
company. This was male bond-
ing in action.

They were there to collective-
ly answer the call of the Big
Rabbit Himself — Playboy
Magazine. The Big Rabbit

spoke to them. Perhaps he.

spoke to them in the ad. in The
Pitt News, which guaranteed
that buying this issue was “A
great way to start the semes-
ter.” Maybe they saw the
posters in the newsstand win-
dows. Or maybe he whispered
to them. One thing for sure
though, they knew they were
about to be indoctrinated by
the Big R_abbit. They asked
him, “a dose of masculinity,
please?” '

Playboy tells men they need
these images in the magazines
and that the images reﬂect real-
ity. They need them if.they are
going to join the other men in
making sure the status of
women lags far behind that of
men. Playboy and patriarchy
need the new men. Boy-o-boy

_ is there a lot wrong with this

picture.

But will the new men join the
others? Probably, unless they
begin to look honestly at their
relationships to porn and
women and make a choice and
commitment to creating a male
sexuality that is not based on
dominance.
admitted, men know a lot
about how pornography is
used to keep women down.
Men rely on pornography
(Playboy included) as well as
advertising and the media, to

Though rarely ‘

shape and reinforce their view
of women. Men-display women

nofalmost every occupational

and college group conceivable
in pornography. ,

There is noreason to believe
that a man raised on Playboy in
our woman-hating culture
would not believe thatgany
woman he meets at college is
just dying for him to violate
and hay_e degrading, violent

sex with her. She is the passive
and sexually insatiable sex

object. That’s what Playboy.

said. How will he interact with
women in his study group this
fall? Will he treat her as an
equal? Will he see that she is
intelligent, worthy, human?
What willhe think about his
female instructors? Will he
speak to her breasts when he
asks a question after class? Will
he try to get close? He wouldn’t
touch her, would he? Will he
even begin to understand the
real pain he causes women?
Given what porn tells men and
what men choose to believe, is
it surprising that men’s abuse
of women (sexual harassment,
battery, rape, etc.) is rampant
on campuses across the coun-
try? - ‘

Playboy says that it’s just
harmless fantasy and that porn
has nothing to do with rape or
maltreatment of women in our
society. But in fact, porn has
everything to do with rape. In
her research on rapists,
Professor Diane Scully, author
of Understanding ‘Sexual
Violence, found two overriding,
common components among
her subjects. The first is that

men who rape have a strong

belief in rape mythology. Rape
myths are societal beliefs about
rape such as “women really
mean yes when they say no”
and “women provoke men to

raping because of dress or
appearance.” The point is this

‘ — rape mythology is the text to

pornography!
The second element that

'Scully found was that rapists

also share attitudes toward

women that are hateful and cal-i

lous; Again, pornographers
paint a horrible and despicable
image of women. They say that
women are tojblame, can’t be

trusted,-.ar.e the ones..with the:
real'“‘poWer‘, heed to be con-

trolled and so on. Not a sur-
prise, but documented in the
research: men are even more
likely to rape if they disrespect,
disbelieve and hate women.

So how can men stop? How
can men change? Well, there
was a different picture at Gus
Miller’s that was actually
attuned to the issue. Picture
this: activists from the Campus
Women’s Organization and
Men Against Rape and
Pornography were on hand to
pass out fliers to customers and
passers-by. On the ﬂier was an
explanation of how men use
porn against women and a
statement encouraging a boy-
cott of Gus Miller’s and any
other store which sells porn
(there are other places to buy
newspapers, pricey soda pop
and stale gum)

Oh yes, some men squealed
“Censorship!” when they saw
us. This too, they mis-learned
from Playboy. It is not censor-
ship to boycott a store. No
store carries all products or all
written material available. Store
managers make choices about
what they sell based on eco-
nomics and sometimes values.
Stores that do not sell porn are
not censoring.

So what can men do to
change? Make a choice.
Respect women. Stop raping.
Listen to women. Reject

pornography (and other issues _

that objectify women). Fight
sexism, racism and homopho-
bia. Stop taking cues from the
Big Rabbit. And stop buying

‘into the wrong picture.

Jim Madl/The Pitt News ‘

Foster rumbles and fumbles as

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Ron Erhardt’s offense
depends on the running game,
and _Barry Foster provided it.

Foster rumbled for 190 yards
and two touchdowns on 33

P . carries behind a battered offen-

sive line in the team’s 27-10

a victory over the Jets yesterday.

The highlight was a 54-yard

scoring dash around the right

end that gave the Steelers the

*  -lead for good.

A pregame decision by head
coach Bill Cowher nearly made
Foster’s big game impossible»

He decided to make_L'eon
Searcy one of his two inactive
players for the game. The logic
was that Ariel Solomon was the
only back-up center, Justin
Strzelczyk is the most experi-
enced back up and Kendall
Gammon is the long snapper.
Very logical, until Tunch Ilkin
went down, and John Jackson
went down and Solomon went
down.

“I looked in there one time.

and saw some faces I am not
used to seeing,” quarterback
Neil O’Donnell said. “A man
from Pitt State. Is that what it
is?”

He was referring to Pittsburg
(Kan.) State grad Gammon,
whose only professional expe-
rience at tackle was on the
scout team. He had to step in
at tackle in the third quarter
until Jackson returned.

“The team needed me in
there so I tried to come back,”
Jackson said about playing with
a leg injury.

The Steeler offense gained
370 total yards, 215 of them on
the ground and controlled the
ball for 37 minutes and 18 sec-
onds. _

“It is hard not to feel good

ilabout the running gamel,”

6 in seasonisﬁrst defeat

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Pitt strong safety Doug
Whaley was not at a loss for
words after his team’s 44-6 loss
to West Virginia Saturday.

“They came into-our house
and kicked our. butts,” Whaley
said. “There is no excuse. You
can’t blame it on the [defensive]
line, the secondary or the line-
backers‘. It is a whole team out
there. I just think they wanted
it more than us.”

Well said.

If that does not tell the story
well enough, throw in the fact
that the 38-point margin of vic-
tory was the largest differential
in the history of the Pitt—WVU
rivalry.

West Virginia racked up 505
yards of total offense, 331 of
them on the ground. That
breaks down to a 5.6 yards-per-
carry average on 59 carries.

“[Stopping the run] is clearly
priority number one,” Pitt head
coach Paul Hackett said. “I felt
at halftime ou.r defense had
played well. We had given
them the one easy score on the
interception [which was
returned for a touchdown].

“We knew Murrell was going
to pound on us. It was just a
matter of keeping our linemen
fresh. They had no turnovers.

- They didn’t appear to make

mistakes. They didn’t appear to
mishandle.”

Murrell blasted the Pitt
defense for 141 yards and one
touchdown on 29 carries. He
did not fumble the ball, as he
did twice the previous week.

.West Virginia gained 504 yards

in a 29-29 tie at Miami (OH) in
that game, but lost five fum-
bles. Their only turnover in this
game was a second—ha1f inter-
ception.

Hackett said the offense
should take some of the blame
for the Mountaineers’ huge
offensive numbers in this game.
He said that the group was
unable to control the ball and
put Pitt's defense on the field
too much.

“The strength of our team is
offense and offense early,”
Hackett said. “The offense was
not the strength today. We
have to look at that and make
the corrections.”

The Pitt offense did gain 369
total yards, but they scored
only six points. More impor-
tantly, in a game in which both
coaches said they wanted to
control the ball, Pitt held the
ball for only 25 minutes and 56
seconds.

Pitt actually started the game
as if they would control it on
their opening drive. After an
eight yard pass from Alex Van
Pelt to Billy Davis, four straight
runs by Curtis Martin took Pitt

‘ to the WVU 44-yard line with a

first down.

The Mountaineers finally
stopped Martin on a fifth try as
Rick Dolly and Derrick Wiley
stuffed the sophomore tailback
for a four-yard loss.

After an incomplete pass,
Van Pelt hit Chris Bouyer at
the 39, but came up short of
the first down and Pitt had to
punt.

West Virginia drove into Pitt .

territory, mostly on a _27-yard
run by Murrell-. On second
down and 11 at the Pitt 35,
quarterback Jake Kelchner hit
James Jett for nine yards, but
the play was called back for
offensive interference.

Instead of third-and-two at I

the Pitt 26, WVU face a third-
and-26 at mid-field. The
Mountaineers came up short
and had to punt. But that only
delayed the inevitable.

The Mountaineers took their
next possession from their own
16 to Pitt’s 32. WVU Coach
Don Nehlen decided to go for
a fourth—down play, and
Kelchner found Mike Baker for
12 yards and a first down at the
20. Wideout James Jett took the
ball to the four on a reverse
and Murrell scored two plays
later on an option from three
yards out.

Pitt seemed ready to answer
as an 18-yard pass to Martin set

See WVU, page 12

Steelers ground Jets

Cowher said. “We have to cor-
rect the turnovers.”

The Steelers had five
turnovers in the game, but the
defensive game still held the
Jets to 239 yards and no touch-
downs. Despite the two inter-
ceptions, O’Donnell had anoth-
er solid effort with 11 comple-
tions on 22 attempts for 185
yards.

Three of the turnovers were
fumbles by Foster. The second-
year halfback said former
offensive coordinator Joe
Walton probably would have
taken him out of the game for
fumbling.

“You carft show a guy you
lost confidence in him,”
Cowher said of leaving Foster

in.

A turnover also killed a
strong opening drive by the
Steelers. Pittsburgh took the
opening kickoff from their own
15-yard line to the Jet 18, most-
ly on a 45-yard pass to Graham
on a third-and-three play. It
was the first of six receptions
by Graham, on which -he
gained 146 yards.

After a Jeff Lageman sack
pushed the Steelers back to the

Jets’ 27, a pressured O’Donnell

victories at Ohio tourney

By Cory Walborn
Staﬁ Writer

Capturing its first victory of
the season, the Pitt volleyball
team continued its up-and-
down performance by winning
two out of three matches in this
past weekend’s Miami (Ohio)
tournament. _

The Panthers started the tour-
nament with a 3-0 drubbing
of tournament host Miami
(Ohio). Winning 15-6, 15-15
-and 15-13. Pitt was led offen-
sively by junior Ann Marie
Lucanie (17 kills) and defen-
sively by sophomore Chelsea
Hemingway (18 digs).

First-year player Sarah Mikla
had an impressive perfor-
mance against the homecourt
Redskins, gathering 12 kills and
10 digs along with a solid .508
attack percentage.

Pitt’s overall attack percent?

age was relatively weak (.208),
but Miami’s was worse (.074).
The Redskins 24 offensive
errors were the downfall in
their opening loss to Pitt.
Stephanie Otten led Miami with
7 kills and 17 digs.

Gaining this firstwin of the
season, the Panthers looked
forward to their second‘ match

against the relatively unknown‘

Boilermakers of Purdue. The

' Boilermakers played well and

made‘ a name for ‘themselves,
while the inconsistent Panthers
became the ones with the iden-
tity problem. 5

“Purdue-is’ .-a different team,’?-

Pitt head coach Sue Woodstra
said. “They take advantage of

every chance they get and we
were not able to put them into
any uncomfortable situations.”

Revealing some of their
youth and inconsistency, Pitt
dropped three straight games
to Purdue. Losing 15-10, 15-12
and 15-5. The Panthers commit-
ted 26 ‘offensive errors as their
attack percentage fell to .074.

“We basically didn’t show up
and lost easily,” Woodstra said
about the Purdue loss.

A Pitt team total of nine serv-
ing errors gave Purdue the
advantage. The Boilermakers
used Pitt’s spiking and serving
woes to accumulate 43 kills
and 48 digs throughout the
match. Purdue also took advan-
tage of Pitt’s inconsistent mid-
dle attack.

“Our middle attack is up and
down,” Woodstra said. “If our
middle is not involved in our
attack and does not relieve the
pressure off-our outside hitters,
we are going to have prob-
lems.”

Lucanie and first-year player
Sara Mitchell collected more
than half of Pitt’s 35 kills.
Lucanie had 13 kills while
Mitchell) contributed
Lucanie also had seven digs in
the losing effort.

Going into the third and ﬁnal

match of the tournament, Pitt"

wondered which of their teams,
the Dr. Jekyl or Mr. Hyde team,
would show. up. Fortunately,
the Panthers put the past two
matches behind them and pre-

«.vailed..3-.2-' over a‘ tough

Northern Illinois team.

Pitt Soccer posts first Big
East Wins. in two years

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff Writer

Bob Dyer called it.
After opening the season

 with a pair of one-goal losses

to less—than-Big East caliber
opponents, California [Pa.] and
Bucknell University, the ‘sopho-
more fullback said that the
Panthers would not only beat a
Big East opposition this week-
end —— something they failed to
do in 1991 —— but win both
road conference match—ups.

. Bob Dyer called it.

The Pitt soccer team swept
into Big East play over the
weekend with apair of huge
wins over Providence College
and Boston College, 3-1 and 1-
0, respectively.

The wins evened the Panther
record to 2-2 on the year, while
the league victories placed
them atop the‘ conference
standings with a sterling mark
of 2-0.

On Sunday, the Panthers got
a late first-half goal from for-
ward Scott Alexander and solid
goaltending from first-year ten-
der Adam Spitzer to hold off
perennial Big East power
Boston College, 1-0.

Eric Prex assisted on Pitt’s
lone shot that eluded Boston
College goalie Brian Boussey,
providing the winning margin

- against the highly propped

Eagle soccer team. BC was
penned third by league coach-
es in the preseason poll of Big

East teams, thanks to a strong -

returning class and the recruit-
ment of three players from
Ireland. 5

BC outshot Pitt 23-7, but
couldn’t break the defenseof
fullbacks Carsten Bishop,
Michale Basaca, Charlie
Wasson, Dyer and goalie
Spitzer. The win-despite’-being
outshotscenario in the Panther
victory serves as poetic justice
for theteam, as Pitt fell victim
to such a plotline twice last
week.‘

On Friday, the Panthers
scored three first-half goals and
held Providence to just eight
shots to grab their first Big East
win since defeating Syracuse,
1-0 nearly two years ago.

' Forward Ted Noethling, full-
back Michael Basaca and first-
year forw,ard Matt Porter
notched goals for the Panthers,
who outshot their opponent
15-8 in the teams’ first win of
the season. Spitzer earned his
first collegiate win, allowing a
harmless second-half goal to
the Friars’ Matt Baldwin and
making two saves in his second
straight start of the young year.

Pitt returns to action this
Wednesday at Pitt Stadium with
a 7:15 p.m. date with Geneva
College. ' -

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staff Writer

Saturday afternoon I was
having a horrifying ﬂashback.
Maybe it was a hallucination,_
I thought. Unfortunately it
was yet another stinging
smack of reality right in the
face of Pitt football.

Two years ago I watched
West Virginia roll up 547
yards in hammering Pitt 38-
24 right here in Pitt Stadium.
That game was much uglier
than the score would lead
you to believe, especially to
those who remember a iun— -
ning back named Michael
Beasley (who?) dancing
through the Pitt defense 22
times for 197 yards.

Beasley and his Mountain-
eer teammates ran wherever
and however long they want-
ed, it seemed, racking up 578
rushing yards on 66 attempts.
The Pride of West Virginia
blared its annoying ﬁght song
and the Mountaineer faithful
frolicked with glee, while . ..
taunting the few Pitt fans
who bothered to show their
faces. ’

Unfortunately- for Beasley,
he didn’t run against Pitt
everyweek or ESPN could
have added him to their
weekly list of Heisman
Hopefuls. Maybe Adrian
Murrell should look into that. 5

ghosts of two years ago, and
other Pitt embarrassments as
well, dealing the Panthers
their worst loss in the 85-
game history of this rivalry.

Pitt’s 44-6 demolition at the
hands of West Virginia raised
significant questions, not only
about the 1992 season, but
about the overallstate of the
Pitt football program. To lose
a football game is merely
human, but to allow an arch-
rival to come into your stadi-
um and hammer you to that
degree is inexcusable and
disgraceful. ,

The argument that the visit-
ing team has won every
game of this series since 1986

Rob
Pugliese

_ Saturday, Murrell and-—tl5ie 3 
Mountaineers brought "back ‘ 

holds absolutely no water.

T hat’s a freak of football.
Allowing 505 yards in total
offense is not. Pitt absorbs
this type of beating in big
games far too often for that
theory to receive any credi-
bility.

With the decline of the Pitt"-_

Penn State series, the WVU

 game should mean so much

more to Pitt, but the last two
times West Virginia visited,
the Panthers got mauled.

Pitt simply was not pre-
pared to play this football
game, and that in itself says
all you need to know about
the lack of progress this pro-

Pitt defensive front. It is not

One or two games is by no
means a season breaker, but
things will not be any easier
against clubs like Rutgers or
Louisville. Need we even dis-
cuss the ground attacks of ,
Syracuse, Penn State or Notre
Dame?

New York’s Dennis Price inter-
cepted it in the end zone.

The Steelers missed another
big play opportunity as Warren
Williams missed a chance to
block a Louie Aguiar ‘punt. The
mistake was compounded
when Foster lost the first of his
three fumbles on the next play.
The Jets could not move the
ball, but Jason Staurovsky gave
them the lead with a 32-yard
field goal.

Foster responded for the
Steelers with a 23-yard burst up
the middle for a score. He ran
the ball on six of the seven
plays on the drive and gained
47 of the 58 yards.

pass.   I S . 
The Pitt offense‘ must’: take
just as much blame and proba-
bly more. This is a veteran unit
that’s as talented and deep as
the 1989 offense, yet they
looked inconsistent and occa-
sionally helpless against a very
average defensive unit at best.

Pitt’s final ﬁgure of 369 total
yards is a completely mislead-
ing and meaningless statistic.
Following the opening series,
where Pitt ﬂashed glimpses of
the potent offense, the Panthers
never really threatened. That
boggles the mind, considering
nine seniors and a juniorstary
ed for the Pitt offense on
Saturday.

The defense is experienced
but not as youthful as one
might think. Eight upperclass—
men started there. Every year it
seems Pitt should be excused
because they’re a “young foot-
ball team that will get better.”
That optimism is getting stale
very quickly, considering gap-
ing holes appear week—in and
week-out to offset any
improvements.

“This looked more to me like
our first ballgame,” Hackett
said. “We just looked like we
didn’t play last week  from
the play of the quarterback
right down through everyone
else. It_ was a half step back-
ward. That’s a concern. This
shouldn’t have happened.”

But it did. The inconsistency
Pitt displays ‘is frightening, and
the wave of missed tackles pre-

vented ‘any ittypie of ‘defensive
momentum. Yes it was one
game, and it would be foolish

and irrational to bury this team. ‘S

based on that, but another six-
win season could spell further
doom. Knowing Pitt’s penchant
for folding up under adversity,
the real concern now is the
eerie resemblance Saturday’s
demolition had to disasters of
the past. The 1990 WVU game
and last year’s Boston (College)
massacre immediately come to
mind.

Hackett stressed that there
will be no dwelling on this per-
formance, especially with
Rutgers awaiting on Thursday
night. Pitt has been notorious
for following blowouts of this
magnitude with tentative, ﬂat
and often poor performances
the next game. Hackett and his
players insist that things will be
different this time.

“Last year was an emotional
roller coaster,” strong safety
Doug Whaley said. “The future
starts Thursday.”

Whaley, a junior, has consis-
tently‘ been one of the most
outspoken players during a
rebuilding program, that at this
point, seems stuck in neutral.
But Whaley believes Pitt’s for-
tunes are moving in a positive
direction and said this team
will set a precedent by quickly
turning this season around

“I think it’s changing right
now. We’re going to try and
prove that Thursday,” Whaley
said. “If we can come out

them up at the WVU 55.
On the next play, Van
Pelt fired a pass in the
ﬂat which was picked off
by Kwame Smith and
returned 70 yards for a
touchdown. Kelchner
then hit Baker for two
points to raise the score
to 14-0, Mountaineers.

“I think the intercep-
tion [was the turning
point]. We missed that
extra point and they
were driving,” Nehlen
said. “If they had stuck
that in, it would have
been a completely differ-
ent football game. The
fact that we intercepted
and [scored] and then hit

the two-point conversion

was a big plus for us.”

Van Pelt and Hackett
both said that the inter-
ception came as a result
of a miscommunication
between Van Pelt and
Davis, the intended
receiver on the play.

A three-plays-and—punt
series by the Pitt offense
was another plus. A 17-
yard punt return by
Baker set WVU up at
Pitt’s 47. Tight end John
Kappa caught a Kelchner

_ pass for a 25-yard gain

and fumbled at ‘the’ one;
‘ But wide receiver Ed Hill

jumped on the ball in the
end zone to give the

._ Mountairieers a "20-0 lead.
' ‘ West Virgi’nia“facked'

6 Mike Vanderjlagt just" '6

before the half and went

to the locker‘ room with a "

23-0 lead. ’ '

Pitt had a chance to
pull back into the game
early in the secondhalf.
Kelchner returned to the
game and was intercept-
ed by Derrick Parker,
who returned it to the
WVU 38.

Van Pelt rolled out on
a bootleg and found tight
end Rob Coons for a 15-
yard touchdown. Sean
Conley missed the extra
point, leaving the score
23-6. ’

The Mountaineers had
the answer to the Pitt
score. They took the ball
80 yards on 14 plays,
capped off by a 10-yard
keeper by Kelchner to
run the lead to 50-6.

West Virginia scored
again after Matt Tiaffoni
‘intercepted a Van Pelt
pass at the WVU 38.
Three plays later
Kelchner hit Jett for a 58-
yard touchdown.

V The Mountaineers
added their final score a
few minutes later as runs
of 26 yards by Ford and
17 yards by Studstill set
up a one-yard score by
Studstill.

A Pitt victory at Rutgers might
stop the bleeding, but it won’t
convince anyone that disasters
of Saturday’s magnitude won’t
happen again. And Pitt is cer-
tainly a long way off from g
proving that they’re moving in
the right direction. The road to

the promised land of the post—
season doesn’t appearto be
any clearer than it has been the
past eight seasons.

Pitt has earned only two
bowl berths in that period and
watched its reputation steadily
diminish in the process.

Thinking bowl bid may be
unrealistic at this point. It’s time
to back up all the talk about
“cleaning the slate” and “stay-
ing focused.” I

“We did not play well from
the very beginning,” Hackett
said. “For some reason we
were off and out of sync We
just have to put it behind us
now.”

For some reason I have a
