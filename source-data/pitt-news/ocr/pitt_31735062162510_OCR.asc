Will Be Cut
By Building

Captain Ray of the Univer-
sity Police reported last week
that the parking lot behind
Clapp hall will be diminished
greatly by the construction of
of a new Natural Science
building this fall.

This Natural Science "Building
will be connected to .Clapp Hall
and will cut the parking lot to
less than a third of. its present
size.

It is hoped that'the construction
of this new addition will begin
late this fall. ’

At present the lot accom-
modates two hundred and twen-
ty cars. After the building is
completed and during its con-
struction only sixty-one cars

will be. permitted to use the lot,
thus leaving one hundred and
seventy-nine cars without space."

.The new building will house the
natural science classrooms which
are now located in Clapp Hall.
University officials feel that the
new building will be a big boost‘
to the natural science division,
but regret its effect on the park-
,i_pg situation.

  Bus. Ad.Department

 Tests Area Trends

By LES ROTHENBERG

Nestled within the ofﬁces of the School of Business Ad- I
‘ministration is a department of the University active in many r
phases of community service,

search.

The ‘Bureau, established in 1924 through a grant from th
Buhl Foundation, continually informs local businessmen and

  

 

 

the Bureau of Business Re-

the public at large of business¢

conditions and trends in the Pitts-

T burgh "metropolitan, area.
Ten full—time staff members and

a varying number _of graduate stu-
dents"’and faculty members par-
ticipating in research projects
comprise the working staff of the
Bureau. ‘

New Acting Director

The, bureau recently ‘lost the
services of the director, Dr. A. M.
Woodruﬁ, who has since assumed
the post of Dean of the School of
Government at George Washing-
ton University.

Dr. Paul D. Walter is present-
ly the acting director of the
Bureau and will hold this “care-
taker” position until a perma-
nent director arrives. His regu-

e lar duties are those of the As-
sistant to the Dean of the School

.of Business Administration and‘
assistant professor. n

The gentlemanhhowever, who is
most directly responsible for the
work accomplished by the Bureau
is Mr. Bervard Nichols.’ Nichols
personally edits every publication
of the" Bureau, including-the two
major reviews of business condi-
tion,-the “Weekly Index of Busi-
ness -Activity,” and tile “Pitts”-
burgh Business Review.”

Major Publication H
r The “Weekly Index of Business
Activity,” sent freeeach week on
request, contains /data, compiled
from individual manufacturers’
reports, Bureau of Labor statistics,
and the latest ﬁgures from. the
Department of Statistics, at Har-
risburg. ‘ _
Since the data contained in
the weekly publication is only
four days old, the “Weekly In-
.dex”‘ is considered to be the
most current business index in
the‘country. Its ﬁndings are re-

 printed’ in the local newspapers,

and important business trends,
such as the present effects of the

 steel strike, are echoed on radio

and television stations through-
out the area.
’ The.—“Pittsburgh Business "Re-
view” ‘is a monthly summary of
the _various weekly reports and
also contains articles of and inter-
pretive nature that are written by

, various faculty members.

Special Service
In addition to the compilation

, of current statistics on local busi-
~ness conditions, the Bureau also

~ Administration

_ﬂ.‘

conducts special ‘research projects _
for. various-industries. Exhaustive 2

studies have produced such mono-
graphs as the ‘.‘Economics of the
Iron and Steel Industry,” _“Shifts

in Marketing of Bituminous Coal,” 

and the “Industrial Data Book,”
an historical collection of data
going back to 1872.

While the majority of the
B_ureau’s publications merely
state statistical data and do not
make predictions‘ for future
business trends,» the Bureau, in
co-operation withthe School of
Business "Administration, spon-
sors an annual conference on
business prospects.

This year’s conference, the sixth.

in the series, will be held on No-
vember 6 and will feature such
speakers as Mr. Ewan Clague,
Commissioner of Labor -Statistic_s,
and Mr. Holgar Johnson, an alum-
nus of the University’s School of
Business Administration, who is
presently the president of the In-
stitute of Life Insurance.

A Community Service

Graduate students make exten-
sive use" of the Bureau’s"facilities
in connection with work on their
theses. One of the possible majors
for a Masters Degree in Business
is business I re-
search, and the Bureau’s wide-
spread facilities are of great value
to these graduate students.

Mr. Nichols, in summarizing
the work of the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research,“ stated, “The
function of the Bureau is to

. perform a service to the com-

munity. We provide business
facts to the business com-
munity.”

A new history course, dealing
exclusively with the history_ of
Pennsylvania, is being offered this
fall by the University.

The course appeals basicallyto 

history teachers, although anyone
in the districtlmay enroll in the
class. The ﬁrst trimesteriof the
course, entitled “Pennsylvania as
a Colony and State” traces" the
growth of the state through inde-
pendence and relates its develop-
ment to that of the nation.

The second half, “Pennsylvania
in the Industrial Age” considers

the state’s leadership in economic , I

and industrial expansion.

Dr. Harry R. Beck, who will
teach the course, has said that
much emphasis will be placed
on the -state’s self-government.
Other issues, such as the effect

opment of the state and the ul-
timate outcome of the indus-
trial revolution will be covered.
Dr. Beck, who specializes in so-
cial and intellectual American
history, has studied at Penn ‘Stats
where he received his Ph.D. de-
gree. Prior to ‘coming here in

By David Brealtstone

“The Mistral” is the name of an unbelievably
vicious and constant wind that blows across Prov-
ence, in southern France, with particular-force
during late summer and early autumn. Mistral is
also rthe name of the great Provencale poet of the
late 19th century whose romantic
lyric, “Mireille,” was fashioned
into the 'Provencale.3folk opera
by Gounod. The French’ ‘National '
Railroad. also has a ‘.‘Mistral,”
which in its owh way ‘is equally
as -dramatic and spectacular as
the first ,couple by the same
names. '

Every afternoon at one o’clock,
a deluxe, aluminum—clad stream-
liner called “The Mistral”_ bolts
abruptly from the dingy plat~ ,
formlsheds of the Gare de Lyon in Paris. With
frightening dispatch‘ it heads southeast, then south.

toward the Riviera and Nice. Termed_ “the fastest .

train on the continent,” =the_“Mistral”: is just that
as'it moves like ‘the wind on its split-second sched-
ule toward the vacation-1ands‘of'the Midi and the
Cote d’Azur. A

If you are a slightly intimidated student/‘with a
summer scholarship from Pitt in your left hand,
a notebook of important French phrases in your
right, and you are heading for the University of
Grenoble’s summer school, you discover that the
mechanized “Mistral” is the fastest way toward
your destination. .

Flying Landscape -

You sit in,‘ the unfamiliar luxury of the ﬁrst-
class compartment.and watch the low, ﬂat farm
land“ near Paris drift by in the June sun. As the
trees begin to ﬂick -by with astonishing speed, .you
get up from your.sea"t,_tripping across the long
legs of the wounded bike-racer"across from‘ you,
and stand in the aisle, watching the, landscape
scamper along through the large picture windows.
You glance at the poster over the window and
notice that it advises that the' average speed be-
tween Paris and Dijon is 80 mph.

After passing themustard town, of Dijon at
three o'clock, the rails begin following the Saone
valley on an arrow-straight southern plunge for
Lyon. Now “The Mistral” starts to chug in earnest."

Learning First . . .

Educate the Educators C   

By Deborah Willson

t‘Among college faculties there still can ‘be
found members who argue for a straight liberal
arts program for future high school teachers to
the ‘exclusion of any courses in professionalized
subject matter. These educators -believe that amas-
tery of a subjectto be taught is ' —
all-important. They seem -to be
unaware of V-the fact that a
teacher is teaching children
through the medium of his sub-
ject matter.”

This is a quote from a col-
lege textbook on education.
Skimmed over by a student hur-
riedly reading an assignment.
such a statement’ is probably
harmless enough. But take this ,
statement and others like it, and " ’
together, they summarize an attitude toward edu-
cation which represents outstanding defect. of
American education. ’ ‘

Form No} Content‘ - ‘ »

Granted, there are many good things about this
country’s educational system. However, the ten-
dency toward emphasizing personality development
instead of, or even at the expense of, presentation
of subject matter is undermining the whole system.

Certainly there is not In America today the rev-
erence ‘toward scholarly achievement and regard
for learning that there is in Europe. We have
quantity, even quality of education, but we do not
have excellence. The mediocre is too often our
ideal; it is all very fine to have good grades; if
you can manage it along with becoming‘ well-
rounded. But good grades do not necessarily indi-
cate an educated person, as we well know. This
attitude toward developing “personality” in schools
is costing us a great deal by leaving undeveloped
the intellect .of those superior students who could
contribute much to our society, not only through
scientiﬁc achievement, but in liberal arts and other
ﬁelds as well. .

‘Well Rounded. More Square

achievement -is rewarded, it is much ' more “so-

along the former lines, John Ciardi and Ina: Almdur

bring to the individual. _
Certainly there are many universities other than
ours where not even as much emphasis is~placed,
on scholarly achievement. However, the basic
fault lies not with the universities but» with the

elementary and secondary schools.’ The attitude / 

fostered there is carried through-into“the univer-
sity to a_ greater or less degree depending on the
institution. ‘ ‘
Misery Likes Company _

The emphasis on “teaching children not subject
matter” on the lower levelsof education does irre-

parable harm, especially,- again, to the superior’ __
student. Take for instance, the. pretty, “well-edu-_ I”

cated” elementary school teacher who presents an
arithmetic lesson with-obvious ‘distaste, but ever‘.
more obviously encourages athletic, tmusical,

distaste for various subjects easily — how do you
suppose children often develop such an intense
dislike and even fear of mathematics?

No, medium “spread out’-’ achievement is _en-.-
couraged in our schools"rather' than excellence.
This may be, as Jacques Barzun and others have
suggested, an outgrowth of our emphasis on “de-
mocracy” in education. We have wanted equality
in all phases of education, and we have got it _—-
at the expense of society. Emphasis on develop-
ment of personality has led not only to the neglect

or. 
other such achievement. Such teachers germina e

his own violation but also to his being neglected
by educators. _

Perhaps in an age when our country faced no.

threat from the “outside” world, when isolation- .

ism was possible, even feasible, in politics as well
as economicsgit did us no harm to emphasize
equal opportunity at the expense of contribution
to science and society. We had enough. Now, how-‘
ever, we face real competition, desperate competi-
tion from outside elements. We can on longer

afford to waste the abilityof men and women lost .

we cannot change this over-emphasized‘ attitude
toward "social achievement from ‘a simple stand-

Loom As Stars
In First Game

By TED COLTON.

Two key plays sent a much
under-rated Marquette team
down to defeat as the Pan-
thers squeaked out a 21-15 vic-
tory in the season opener at
Milwaukee Saturday.

Mike Ditka and Ray Tarasi
turned out to be “Johnnies on the
spot" when they came up with
the big plays to save the Blue and
Gold from an upset.

Late in the final quarter with
the Panthers trailing, 15-13, Dit-

line to block Pete H-all’s punt.
Then recovered it to give the
Panthers the ball on Marquette’s.
seven-yard line. Two plays later
Ivan Toncic found Ditka in the
end zone for the winning touch-
down. A
More Thrills in Store

But there were more thrills in
store? for the better than 15,000
fans who braved the overcast day,
for the Warriors’ drove down to
the Panthers’ 14-yard line where
they had a fourth-and-two situa-
tion and only seconds remaining.

Hall, who had already complet-
ed 22 passes, was ordered to pass
once more. Tim Zhulkie, 174-
pound end of Marquette, cut
sharply into’ the end zone and
was greeted by Tarasi. Both
came down with nothing but air.

“I knew he was coming,"
stated Tarasi,,“so I just stayed
with him. ’1‘hey had been pass-
ing all day and ‘we were expect-
ing a pass on this big one,” con-
cluded the sophomore from
Harmarville. ‘

The outstanding player of the
day had to be Ditka. The “Ham-
mer,” as he is most affectionately
called by his teammates, was all
over the field making key tackles,
blocking punts and scoring
touchdowns.

Hall Rates Ditka High

“Ditka is all you need on a
football team to have a good
one,” stated Hall, who spent the
day harassing the Panthers’ sec-
ondary with his pin-point pass-
ing. “He is a line pro prospect

and can do everything well,” con-
cluded the opposing quarterback.

In the dressing room after the
game the “Hammer,” having a

‘deep cut over his right eye stated,

“This was the hardest. game I've
ever played. They had a real good
football team.”

,When asked about the kick
he had blocked he related, “I
wasn’t even supposed to rush
in on the punt. The play was

set up for the ends to drop back
and block for the received.

“But on the previous punt I
noticed that their fullback was
paying no attention to me, so after
I took three steps in I knew he
wouldn’t be bothering with me so
I just ‘put my head down and
went in.”

“We keep moving them~back and forth,” Coach Bimbo
Cecconi said. “They are running hard and the tackling has

been very sharp. At this point

we may have to wait to the

opening game with Penn State on¢
October 17, before we make any
definite choices." \

The only serious injuries have
been to Frank Walton and Chuck
Adonizio. Walton may be lost for
the season with a broken hand,
while Adonizio may be out for
a few weeks with a sprained
ankle.

Frosh in Good Shape

Although this year's frosh squad
is rated as the "biggest and best
since Joe Walton was a Panther
freshman, they still are able to
mo've quickly. “Most of the men
are taking off some weight," said
Cecconi. “But our big men are
in good sh_ape. In fact the entire
squad is in fairly good shape.”

Gary Kaltenbach, a 260 pound
tackle with good lateral move-
ments, seems to be one of the
leading linemen, although Bob
Zvolerin, Ed Ademchek and Bob
Ostrosky. have also been in the
running for starting berths. '

frosh are Tom Brown and Bob
Long. Long caught a touch-
down pass in last week’s scrim-
mage. Throwing that TI) and
one other in the scrimmage was
Jimbo Traficant.

Traficant has been the leading
quarterback thus far. Possessing
good deceptive moves and a good
throwing arm, Traiicant could
well be one of the best quarter-

along in some time.
Backﬁeld Has Po_wer

Spirit‘-has been equally as keen
among the frosh backs. There are
no “breakaway” runners, but
there are many players that have
the power to gain big yardage.
Dennis Chillinsky, Carmen Ronca
and Larry Schmidt have been the
leading halfbacks.- Each has fair
speed and good power.

Jon Botula, cousin of Pat Bo-
tula, Penn State’s power running
fullback, seems to be leading the
fullbacks. Botula has been run-
ning hard and taking advantage
of the running room given him
by the huge frosh line. Lou Slaby
is also listed as one of the better
fullbacks.

  aces Rough‘Seh_edule

The Panthercross country team is preparing for what

3% coach Carl Rees calls, “an awfully rough schedule.”

The greatest deﬁciency in the squad will come from the,
loss of team captain John Christoll. The loss of Christoff, due ‘

«to graduation, will deﬁnitely have its effect on the harrier’s
chances of an outstanding season. Coach Rees says, “Christoff

was a sincere and well conditionedé

athlete that could always be
counted on in clutch situations.”
