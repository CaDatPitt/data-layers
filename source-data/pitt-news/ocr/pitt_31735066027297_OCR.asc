Going under the knife?

Dean Peter Koehler says departments facing
cuts don ’t have to defend themselves — yet.

_Ce_s  tonelli and Ben Jackson

   

The chairs of graduate departments slat-
ed for review and possible elimination met
on Sunday with the committee charged with
making recommendations to top-level
administrators about their status.

Peter Koehler, dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, said the departments
involved would not have to defend them-
selves just yet. Sunday’s meetings were only
to set the process into motion and farniliar—
ize faculty members with the issues the
committee would be raising in the coming
months, according to Koehler.

“Everything is very raw at this point,”
Koehler said. “There is a lot of information
to be absorbed.”

The committee’s recommendations are
due to Koehler by Mar. 1. Koehler said that
while the committee does not make the deci-
sions about what will become of these grad-
uate departments, they do have a strong
inﬂuence.

No undergraduate programs will be
reduced during these proceedings.

The departments in the most danger are
those that were classiﬁed in categories four,
departments to be reviewed; ﬁve, depart-
ments to be reduced; and six, departments to
beeliminated,asstatedinareportthatwas
issued in April of 1995. Departments com-
prising these categories included the foreign
languages and literatures, geology, religious
studies, sociology, theater arts, crystallogra-

 
   
 

phy, and communication science and disor-
ders.

“Having graduate programs of top
quality in the Arts and Sciences is essential
in a university that aspires to greatness; cer-
tainly that includes pregrams of quality in
the humanities,” said Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg.

“Both the dean and the provost have a
sense of vision for theArts and Sciences that
includes an important role for the humani-
ties. [But] there is a special responsibility to
makesurethatthesearepmgramsofhigh
quality.”

The committee has also been charged
with determining a “target size” for the FAS
faculty by department, as well as advising
the dean about the number of 'part—time
instructors needed in each area There are
about 550 faculty members in FAS this year,
and the provost has said the number is too
high.

Members of the committee declined
comment on the review process or Sunday’s
meetings. Heads of the departments under
review also had no comment on the pro-
ceedings.

Koehler defended keeping the delibera-
tions secret, saying it was necessary for an
honest review.

“People need to be able to speak open-
ly, and the only way they can do that is if
every thought isn’t publicized,” said
Koehler.

Administrators have said they hope
most faculty reductions will come in the

Pitt student’ s internet
posts ruled free
speech, not threat

arc Nuzzo

 

In a case that has sparked a national controversy over the
freedom of expression on the intemet, one Pitt student has set
a precedent for future cases.

Abraham Jacob Alkhabaz, a Pitt senior who has
Americanized his name to Jake Baker, stood accused of ﬁve
counts of making interstate threats to injure someone.

These federal charges were made against Baker for post-
ing graphic stories about the rapes and murders of several
females on an electronic bulletin board in 1995.

The story, which was the center of the controversy, was
about the rape and torture of a woman whose name was the
same as one of Baker’s classmates at the University of
Michigan.

“The premise is that my friend Jerry and I have broken
into the apartment of this girl, [Jane Doe] whom I know from
call [sic] and we are porceding [sic] to have a little frm with
her,” Baker wrote in the preface to his story.

Throughout the story, some of the “fun” Baker describes
includes tying the girl’s hair to a ceiling fan, sticking a hot
curling iron into her anus, and cutting off her nipples

The case of U.S. v. Abraham Jacob Alkhabaz , which
lasted over two years, ended this past Wednesday when the
U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled two to one to dismiss
the charges.

' The circuit court’s decision was unexpected for Baker.

“To be honest with you, I was expecting this to go the
other way,” said Baker, after just hearing the news. “It’s a
pleasant surprise.”

Baker’s lawyer in the appeal, David Cahill, was happy
with the decision, saying it is a precedent—setting case that
shows people are free to express themselves over e—mail and

The only thing standing between
some Pitt students and an uncontrolled,
speeding car early Sunday morning was a
pipe railing fence, and it may have saved
their lives.

Around 2:15 a.m., a car travelling
northbound on Bigelow Boulevard struck
the rear end of a speeding vehicle that ran
through a red light on Fifth Avenue.

The speeding vehicle, a metallic sil-

section of Bigelow and Fifth and spun
wildly down Fifth Avenue. The car slid

They wiped silent tears and lifted
their voices singing, “For our life
together we celebrate. Life that lasts
forever, we celebrate.”

It was not a typical memorial ser-
vice. Sam Brunsvold, the 36-year-old
campus minister slain last Tuesday
was given a memorial service reﬂec-
tive of the life he led.

In the crowded assembly room of
the William Pitt Union, friends and
relatives gathered to remember the
life of a leader. His father and two
brothers made the crowd laugh with
anecdotes of Sam’s life. ' They
remembered Sam’s childhood com-
moms and reﬂected on their conver-
sations with him about death as
adults.

Anthony Brunsvold, Sam’s
younger brother said he always
thought Sam was going to be the one
at his funeral. He joked, saying that
since Sam had married him and his
wife, he figured he would bury him
too. '

“It rhymed,” he said, and the
crowd laughed.

But what the younger brother
really wanted the crowd to remember
was why Sam lived the life he did.

“He did what he did because he
was confident in the resurrection of

 
 

Jesus Christ,” said Anthony. And
because of that, hcsaid Sam was
confident in his own resurrection.

Around the room the crowd was
mixed with people of other religions.
Many wiped tears from their eyes as
speakers talked about Sam’s min-
istry.

Bob Konccrak, a Christian
Student Foundation board member
talked of his friendship with Sam.

“Everything about Sam was
about learning. His life was a con-
stant stream of education,” Konccrak
said. “He left behind a formidable
library.”

Konccrak also talked about
Sam’s dedication to his family and
his commitment to his children. He
loved to go fishing, camping, and
was always reading to his children.

Sam’s father, Arlen Brunsvold
said Sam was committed to his wife
Sherri and they did everything as a
team.

Sherri Brunsvold didn’t speak at
the service. Instead she wrote a thank
you in the program, remembering the
times they had as a family. Along
with the outdoor trips, she recalled
nightly prayers as a “wonderful”
memory.

“He would always ask, ‘Hey,
how ya doin’? and meant it. He was
there to counsel hurting people,”

the intemet.

“The intemet is the most important
medium since the printing press,” he said.

Cahill went on to say this was a great
step for free speech and that Baker never
should have been charged in the first
place. Q

The charges against Baker were
dropped when the court determined that
the evidence was not sufficient, Cahill
said. He said that the court determined the
stories weren’t threats as deﬁned under
law.

“This is a major decision because it is
rare that an indictment be dismissed,” said
Cahill.

Cahill said that the government has
60 days to ﬁle another notice of intent to
appeal. If they do, the next stop for the
case will be the United States Supreme
Court.

Cahill would not say for certain
whether the case was over, though,
because every time he has tried to guess
the govemment’s moves, he said he has
guessed wrong.

Baker said he feels much more conﬁ-
dent that the last gavel has dropped in this
case.
“I’m concerned but feel this appeal
might be the hump in the case,” said
Baker. He then went on to say that any

action by the government from this point

would be strictly “for show.”

“I feel that a society has the right to
monitor elements it might consider oﬁ”en-
sive,” said Baker. “In this case, the careful
monitoring turned into a mass hysteria and
a witch hunt.”

Baker is not alone in defending his
stories as free speech. The American Civil
Liberties Union rushed to his side in

defense of free speech.

“The values of the first amendment
must be protected even in cyberspace,”
said Howard Simon, Michigan executive
director of the ACLU, in a written state-
ment.

Though the ACLU has referred to the
writings on intemet sites as the “most
vicious, racist, woman—hating pomogra-
phy in existence,” they defended Baker’s
actions.

The ACLU claimed that though the
name, e—mail address, and home address
of the woman in his class were all pub-
lished at one point in the stories, there was
no threat implied. The trial court agreed.

But many have strongly disagreed
since a University of Michigan alumnus

Nmmhﬂ

THE PITT NEWS

 

living in Russia brought the stories to the
attention of University of Michigan
administrators in January, 1995.

The alumnus had discovered the post-

ings and traced them to a student there by

the name of Jake Baker.

Baker said in a 1995 interview with
People magazine that he never intended to
hurt the woman from the original story,
whose identity has been withheld.

On Feb. 1, 1995, University of
Michigan President James Duderstadt
suspended Baker under a university bylaw
which allowed for the emergency suspen-
sion of any student who may pose a threat
to the community or himself.

According to Laurie Burns, director
of the information and technical division
at the University of Michigan, “[Baker]
didn’t violate any computing division
policies. They were more university poli-
cy violations.”

A government investigation eventu-
ally tumed up more information on
Baker’s computer activity after searching
past communications and the original sto-
ries for clues. The authorities found that
many of his other stories described in
detail the brutal rapes and murders of sev-
eral women.

When it was discovered Baker had
been communicating with a Canadian
counterpart, Arthur Gonda, the federal
government arrested Baker. on Feb. 9,
1995.

The FBI later determined that Arthur
Gonda was a pseudonym, and the individ-
ual has never been found or identiﬁed.

Baker was charged with violating a
United States code making criminal “the
transmission in interstate or foreign com-
merce of a communication containing any
threatto kidnap any person or any threat to
injure the person of another.”

The case was brought to federal dis-
trict court, where Judge Avem Cohn dis-
missed it because he said the stories
implied no threat to the woman mentioned
in the stories.

The government then ﬁled an appeal.
The case was again tried in the circuit
court which rendered its decision last
Wednesday, nearly three months after the
actual deliberations.

Cahill said he and Baker’s family are
“very pleased” that the case is over and
that Jake can now move on with his life.

“I’ve been moving on for two years
now,” said Baker. “I’ve got a pretty good
head start.”

Student government denies
Greek Week request of $10, 000

b

   

 

Student Government Board members
shut down a request for more than $10,000
by Greek Week organizers to fund their
opening ceremony and dance marathon in
March.

Last year, Greek Week representatives
asked the allocations committee for $4,100;
this year, their request has jumped to $7,100.

Organizers also requested $3,534 for
Greek Week opening ceremonies, but Board
members voted unanimously to deny it.

By the end of the meeting, it still

seemed unclear to the Board members how
they should vote on the dance marathon
request. The issue was sent back to the allo-
cations committee for further revision. A
ﬁnal decision will be made at the next SGB
meeting.
A The dance marathon is an annual Greek
Week event, with the money raised going
towards a charity. This year’s charity is the
Make—A-Wish Foundation.

In the re-evaluation of the request, allo-
cations committee members will examine
why the Greek Week organizers feel the
need to increase the funding for the event.

Board member Marquette Bowman
asked the other members of the Board to
wait on a vote and look further into the mat-
ter. He said that in years past, the event had
been held at the ﬁeld house and if held there
again this year, the cost would be much less.

“Seventy—one hundred dollars for social
dancing is a lot of money,” Bowman said.

According to Cecily Trbbs, one of four
Greek Week chairs, the year the marathon
was held at Fitzgerald ﬁeld house, it was run
by Family House and the University; not by
the Greeks.

“Greeks were strongly encouraged to
participate, though,” said Tibbs.

This year’s marathon will be held at
Metropol, located in the Strip District.
Michelle Fuhrer, another Greek Week chair-
person, said that this year’s marathon is ten-
tatively set to have a “Flashback to the ‘80s”

theme and will not only include dancing, but
also contests and games.

“We expect around 800 to 1,000 stu-
dents to attend this year,” said Fuhrer. “The
marathon is one of the largest money makers
[at Pitt], and all the money goes to charity.
Metropol charges $6,000 for use of their
facilities. It is not a donation.”

She said this is why Greek Week orga-
nizers have asked the Allocations
Committee for $7,100 this year.

Though the proceeds would go to a
good cause, board member David Teeters
reminded other members of the board that
SGB does not ﬁmd charities.

Allocations Chair Noelle Campagna
was also against such a large request.

“Allocations has not made an excel}
tion. We are not paying for DJs or for the
events in raising money for a charity,”
Campagna said.

One question raised by Board members
was whether this dance marathon was listed
as a social function or a charity. Campagna
said it was a social function.

Other issues at the meeting included an
announcement that SGB will sponsor an
informal “speak-out” scheduled for Tuesday,
Feb. 4, at 8:30 p.m. in 637 Wrlliarn Pitt
Union. The conference will deal with eating
disorders and the emotional problems peo-
ple encounter in dealing with them.

There will be a psychiatrist from
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in
attendance to answer questions and provide
information about anorexia and bulimia and
theproblerns associated with the two disor-
ders.

Those who wish to talk about their
experiences or just listen to others are
encouraged to attend. There will also be
three women on hand to share their experi-
ences and to talk with members of the audi-
ence.

‘This is an opportunity to let students
know that the Student Government Board
cares about its students, and we aren’t just
politics up here,” said Board member
Christa Douaihy.

form of attrition —— the failure to ﬁll posi-
tions once they are vacated.

The issue of attrition raises concerns
about retirement packages speciﬁcally tai-
lored to entice professors to leave the
University. As of Friday, no changes had
beenmade to the FAS retirement package,
but Nordenberg confirmed that discussions
are ongoing.

“That is a matter that is a work in
progress,” said Nordenberg. “It’s the respon-
sibility of the Senate Council and the most
directly involved administrative offices.”

Koehler and Nordenberg both said that
these reviews would have been conducted
even without the $2.6—million shortfall in the
FAS this year. Provost James Maher has
committed $1.4 million from “various one-
time expenditures” to bailing out the school,
but he would not comment on what those
expenditures would be. ~

Nordenberg said the speciﬁc ftmds used
to eliminate the debt would be determined
as time goes on, but he too refused to com-
ment on the source of the money.

“Each of us anticipates pulling money
from a range of places as we progress
through the year,” said Nordenberg. “It is a
real challenge in the current environment to
deal with that kind of shortfall.”

Though officials said that the debt and
these reviews are not related, the apparent
suddenness of these proceedings has left
many wondering why FAS must tighten its
belt in times of ﬁnancial crisis, while the ath-
letic department is allowed to add a
women’s softball team to their program.

The Graduate Student Organization
wrote a letter to the provost, charging that
the administration places more weight on
losing athletic teams than it does on strong
graduate programs.

“New1y—appointed Athletic Director
Steve Pederson stated that making each ath-
letic team at the University ‘competitive’ in
the Big East was an ‘attainable’ goal,” the
GSO said in the letter dated Jan. 16. “Does
the University not consider the cultivation of

 

excellent graduate programs equally attain-
able?”

Nordenberg said that though the athlet-
ic department is in debt, this is not a case of
favoritism.

“We aspire to quality in everything that
we do,” Nordenberg said. “We need to take
careful account of everything we do. That’s
the case in athletic programs, academic pro-
grams, everything. We need that kind of uni-
formity across the board.

"The overall athletic program that I
inherited, which includes both revenue—pro-
ducing and non-revenue—producing sports,
was operating at a substantial deﬁcit. We
have made real progress in turning that situ-
ation around. There is more work to be
done, but all of our efforts in athletics are
geared both toward the pursuit of quality
and budgetary responsibility.”

The- GSO also criticized a “lack of
vision” on the part of the provost because
these reviews have taken so long.

“When asked whether he could state
[Provost Maher’s] vision of the role of the
humanities, Dean Koehler responded blunt-
ly that he could not,” the letter said.

Maher responded to the GSO in a letter
dated Jan. 28, saying: “The process is a dif-
ﬁcult one; it takes time to make thoughtful
and sometimes painful decisions. Your
questions concerning the speciﬁc proce-
dures followed by FAS in its plamiing
process are probably most appropriately
handled by FAS.”

Nordenberg defended‘ both the GSO
and the FAS procedures.

“Everyone is eager to push the planning
process forward to the extent that the [GSO]
is expressing that position,” said
Nordenberg. “I  there would be agree-
ment with it. The work of the committee
will be a very important next step.’

“It seems to me that the process is now
on track,” said Nordenberg. “That’s the
most important thing for anyone with an
interest in the health and strength of the pro-

Crash

across the Port Authority bus lane, and
then struck a pipe railing fence nearly 50
yards away, ripping a section of the railing
down. .

The rear bumper was completely torn
from the vehicle, and the back window
exploded on impact when the car struck
the railing, sending a cloud of glass shards
flying for nearly a hundred feet.

The car then bounced off the railing
and came to rest facing the correct direc-
tion on the one way street.

“We heard a ‘BOOM... BOOM’ and
saw the passenger and driver [of the
Sterling] jump out. It all happened so
fast,” said two witnesses, who asked to
remain anonymous.

The witnesses said they were getting
out of a Pitt shuttle when the accident
occurred. They said they had seen the car
racing down Fifth Avenue “going at least

70 or 80 miles per hour.”

The railing stopped the car from spin-
ning into the sidewalk and possibly into
the William Pitt Union’s driveway. "

Pittsburgh Police at the scene would
only say that the car was “travelling at a
high rate of speed.”

The driver of the Sterling said that his
brakes failed and that the car was only
travelling at about 30 or 35 miles per hour.

“We couldn’t stop,” said the driver.

Moments later, he failed a ﬁeld sobri-
ety test and was taken to the Zone 6 station
for further tests.

The driver and passenger of the
northbound car, a two—door Acura Integra,
suffered no injuries. Their car, however,
received moderate front end damage.

The passenger of the speeding vehicle
suffered from minor injuries but refused

Responsibility must be taken for
wickedness as well as for power

When the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of appeals ruled 2 to 1 on

Wednesday that Jake Baker was not threatening a classmate
who was featured as the victim of rape and murder fantasies he
had posted on the intemet, they were protecting his right to free
speech. _ . '
The First Amendment is ﬁrst for a reason. The freedom of
expression is necessary to the freedom of thought. At the same
time, however, there are tremendous responsibilities that go
along with rights, and Baker, the ACLU, and the; courts would
like to ignore them.

Sure, Baker, like the rest of us, can write whatever he
wants, but he must face certain consequences for what he
writes. The court found him innocent of criminally threatening
the woman described in his story, but if his story was truly just
a piece of ﬁction rather than an expression of intent, why did he
use her real name? Perhaps she should pursue a civil lawsuit,
rather than relying on the criminal justice system to assert her
right to live without fear of a person who has publicly
described, in vivid detail, his desire to rape, torture, and kill her.
Alternately, maybe the prosecutor simply ﬁled the wrong crim-
inal charge. ' j

The difficult line to be walked here is the one between free-
dom and safety. As Nietzsche said, “Whoever ﬁghts monsters
should see to it that in the process he does not become a mon-
ster.” While we must protect the woman’s right to live without
the terror that Baker has inﬂicted upon her, we must also pro-
tect the right for people to express themselves; otherwise, we
risk a totalitarian regime in which the government has the
power to take away our freedom of speech piece by piece.

How do we battle both these monsters without becoming
monsters ourselves? We can ﬁght by speaking up and challeng-
ing those who would abuse their rights. Freedom of speech does
not give you the right to go unchallenged. In other words, for
every protest, there can be a counter-protest. All must take
responsibility, not only for their power, but for their wickedness
as well. . ’ '

Moynihan is the man with a plan

 

Do you know who Daniel
Patrick Moynihan is? If not, then
allow me to educate you: Moynihan
is a United States Senator represent-
ing the state of New York, and he sits
on the prestigious Senate Finance
Committee as the panel’s ranking
Democrat. Perhaps no other mem-
ber of Congress is as respected as
Moynihan for his intellect, his fore-
sight, and his candor. Before
Reagan, he predicted the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Before virtually
any other politician, he realized that
America’s inner-cities were in
decay. Now he sees trouble with
what is perhaps America’s most suc-
cessful federal government pro-
gram: Social Security.

The fate of Social Security does
not look good VV1th the retirement
population about to swell when the
baby boom generation retires, the
Social Security trustees alarmed the
nation in 1994 when they predicted
that in 2029, the Social Security trust
fund would be bankrupt seven years
before most projections. If the feder-
al government continues to do noth-
ing, it will be forced to either devote
the entire federal budget to entitle-
ment projects (Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid) or raise taxes
by 50 percent by the year 2025. Note
to socialists who would be over-
joyed at this idea: European coun-
tries tax about 50 percent of their
production to provide generous wel-
fare beneﬁts for their citizens within
the system. Unemployment in

. Europe stands at 10 percent and job

creation is virtually nil. Pick your
poison.

» One of the most talked-about
plans for rescuing Social Security is

the new proposal to privatize the
program and invest most (if not all)
of the program into the stock market.
The idea of investing the Social
Security trust fund into the stock
market has some mighty serious
ﬂaws, though. Chief among them is
thefactthatwhilethestockmarket
has been rising at an almost expo-
nentialrateforthelastdecade,there
is always the possibility (or
inevitability) of a serious downtum.
An economics professor at Yale
announced in 1929: “Stocks have
reached what looks like a perma-
nently high plateau.” Less than two
weeks later, the market collapsed
and America plunged into the Great
Depression. If the stock market
doesn’t perform exactly as most
experts predict (and any trader can
tell you that predicting the stock
rnarket’s ﬂuctuations is nearly
impossible), the federal treasury
could lose trillions of dollars. It
wouldn’t even take a depression for
disaster to strike. A simple rniscalcu-
lation in the rate of increase could
throw the entire Social Security pro-
gram into chaos.

While the stock market idea
certainly does sound ﬁne in the
abstract, it is really simply another
example of the government bucking
its responsibility to make hard choic-
es.

Sen. Moynihan, who fears that
politicians will jump on the stock
market bandwagon rather than con-
sider more painful choices, has pro-
posed a simple solution to the Social
Security program: since the con-
sumer price index has been overesti-
matedby 1.1 percent each year (and
Social Security checks are tied to the
CPI), retirees have been getting
more than they should be getting.
Merely cutting the CPI by 1.1 per-

cent would save a whopping $1 tril-
lion over the next 12 years. It would
also ensure that Social Security
would remain solvent until the mid-
21 st century.

Wﬂl Social Security be around
when we retire? Conventional wis-
dom would say no, but I am going
outonalimbandgarnblingthatin
some form or another, Social
Security will be still be around.
However, if my prediction is to
come true, politicians in Washington
will have to shelve their petty differ-
ences and work together. I think that
President Clinton and the leading
Republican in Washington, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott (the dis-
closures of Newt Gingrich’s disre-
gard for congressional ethics have
pretty much ruined his credibility on
anything), can work together. I
expectthemtoworkoutanagree-
ment about entitlement programs in
the future. I think that Sen.
Moynihan’s solution is a great place
to start.

I feel, though, that it is vital for
us to make our voices heard in this
matter. I was thoroughly disgusted
by a column I saw in The Pitt News
last November telling people not to
vote because their votes didn’t mat-
ter, and there was no point caring
about politics. The fact is that our
political leaders do care, and they
will base their decisions in the future
on whether or not people care about
an issue. If you care about your
future, then I can’t stress this strong-
ly enough: educate yourself! If you
don’t let our leaders in Washington
know how you feel, its your own

fauilt if you don’t like what is going
on.

Michael Berquist is a ﬁrm believer
that democracy is not a spectator

Green Bay
can show us
the way p

-:r

 

I love the Green Bay Packers. They
are what every team in professional sports
should be. A team that plays for their fans
just as much as themselves. A team that
doesn’t have to go out and sign a high-

. priced jerk for millions, but instead devel-

ops their young players. A team that
makes you wish you lived in \Visconsin.
The reason for all thesepraises is that
‘the Pack is the only team in professional
sports that is owned by the city they play
in. A group of stockholders made out of
every day Joes and high-ranking citizens
owns the team as one. There is no proﬁt-
monger owner like Jerry Jones, who
ﬂaunts his green and spits in the face of the
NFL. .
Now this is perfect because the fans
own the team. They would never let their
team leave, and if they have gripes, they

. can voice their complaints at sharehold-

ers’ meetings held by the Packer organiza-
tion throughout the year. The team won’t
necessarily take everything the stockhold-
ers say to heart, but hey — I’d rather be
able to tell the president and general man-
ager of my team what they are doing
wrong instead of bitching on talk radio or
to my buds.

The Packers are also made up of role-
model players who seem as tight and
together as a Marine platoon. During the
two-week prelude to the Super Bowl,
there were a million or so video clips of
‘Packer teammates hanging around togeth-
er. The camaraderie shows in their play.

“No one is selﬁsh or concerned with his

own stats. They simply want to win, and
that’s what they do.

Packers team. After leaving the Falcons

Hoopsters drop Backyard Brawl, 74-59  

wlachariah Blott '

 

With poor shooting, horrid
rebounding, and a West Virginia
team that showed up with more
than just third team all-Big East
selection Damian Owens, Pitt
watched a mere two—point
deﬁcit at halftime turn into a 74-
59 loss at Morgantown on
Saturday. ’

Pitt converted only 22 of 63
shots in the game for a .349
shooting percentage, their low-
est in the past 16. games.

“We had_some great looks
in the first half and didn’t knock
them down,” said Head Coach
Ralph Willard. In fact, Pitt hit
only two of eleven three-point-
ers in the first half, compared to
their 24 threes in the last two
games. ‘

Also, Kellii Taylor, who
had been shooting at a .522 clip
in the past two games, went
zero for 6 in both halves.
Willard attributed everyone’s
poor marksmanship to the lack
of players touching the ball. '

“We didn’t get anyone in a
rhythm today because we didn’t
have enough people touch the
basketball. There wasn’t the ball
movement we had in the
Georgetown and Notre Dame
games.”

Pitt’s inside game was also
lacking on Saturday. Out-
rebounded 52 to 33, Pitt could-
n’t get the inside advantage they

THE PITT NEWS

desperately needed, considering
their guards shot ll-for-4] on
the day. Willard pointed out that
Gerald Jordan’s partially-tom
shoulder muscle didn’t help the
Panthers’ effort in the paint, but
said he didn’t want to use the
injury as an excuse for poor
inside play.

“Today our inside game
didn‘t give us a heck of a lot.
We’re losing by 19 rebounds, so
that’s half the game right there.”

Although West Virginia’s
jack-of—all—trades Owens scored
only six points, the restof the
team picked up the slack. Power
forward Gordon Malone bullied
Pitt on the inside for 16 points,
16 rebounds, and three blocked
shots.

‘This was almost a mirror-
irnage of the Boston College
game, in that we weren’t physi-
cal enough with this team under
the basket,” said Willard.

Mountaineer guard Adrian
Pledger pulled down 10 boards
and tossed in a garne-high 17
points, including a jumper with
3:30 left in the game to extend
the WVU lead to 10, putting the
game out of reach for the cold-
shooting Panthers.

Additionally, guard Jarrod
West and forward Brent
Solheirn contributed 22 points
off the bench, along with eight
rebounds.

The ﬁrst half was an up-
and-down 20 minutes for
VVillard’s troops. After West

Vonteeg Cummings I s backcourt tes went

l l-for-4l from the field against the Mountaineers.

Virginia scored the game’s first
basket, Pitt went on a 7-0 run. A
few minutes later, West Virginia
had a 16-5 run over a ﬁve-
minute period, followed by an
8-2 run by the Panthers, marked
with crowd-quieting dunks by
both Mark Blount and

Vonteego Cummings.

The first half ended with an
alley—oop type play, in which
Kevin Willard inbounded the
ball from under Pitt’s basket to
an airborne Cummings, who
caught the ball and shot it in

Prior to this weekend, the
Pitt wrestling team’s record
stood at 9-2 — a mark that, for
the most part, had been achieved
by beating up on some less-than-
elite teams. This weekend, how-
ever, the grapplers proved that
they are the real deal with two
outstanding performances
against two nationally-ranked
teams — Penn State and
Indiana.

Regular l18—pounder Chris

of disciplinary reasons, so red-
shirt sophomore Jonathan Hazi
had the unenviable task of taking

Hunter. Hunter won the match
19-7 and gave Penn State an
early 40 lead.

At the 126-pound weight
class, Pitt’s Rob Loper, a true
freshman, upset Penn State’s
Jason Betz, who is ranked 10th
in the nation.

“I knew it would be a good
match,” Loper said of his 5-4
victory. “I lost to him l-O earlier
in the year (at the Lock Haven
Invitational), but I’ve been
wrestling a lot better lately.”

‘Patrick Robertson

The Pitt women’s basketball team
dropped another conference game
Saturday afternoon, as they lost 59-53 at
Rutgers.

This loss drops the Lady Panthers to
2-9 in the Big East. With only seven
games left before the Big East
Tournament, Pitt can finish no better
than .500 in their conference. They are
also assured of a sub—.500 record overall,
as the weekend’s loss dropped them to 7-
15 overall.

Turnovers once again plagued Pitt as
they committed 30, opposed to Rutgers’
12. This makes 66 Pitt turnovers in the
last two games. JoJo Guzman committed
nine of those turnovers. Kelly Senneca.
Melissa Thompson, Latia Howard, and
Alecia Balich each added four.

Pitt shot very well in the ﬁrst half.
They hit almost 56 percent of their shots,
while their opponents only hit 35 per-
cent. This was not enough, though, as
Rutgers took a 30-27 lead into halftime.

After the half, things started to fall
apart for Pitt. The Lady Panthers still
shot 41 percent, but they were outscored
by three again to drop the game by six.

Howard was the only Lady Panther

 

Monday, February 3, ‘I997

to reach double figures, as she hit for 14
on the afternoon. The junior also had 10
rebounds to record a double-double.
Guzman surpassed her average of 3.7
points per game with a nine-point perfor-
mance. ’

Rutgers’ Tomora Young led all scor-
ers with 19 points. Usha Gilmore fol-
lowed close behind for the Scarlet
Knights with 14.

After much speculation about the
return of Gina Montesano, it has been
discovered that she will miss the remain-
der of the season because of an injury
sustained Jan. 4 in a loss to Seton Hall.
She is a sophomore and is the Lady
Panthers’ leading scorer, averaging 20
points per game. She underwent arthro-
scopic surgery on Jan. 23 to repair the
hamstring that has been ailing her.

This surgery put her out for the sea-
son. She was the only Pitt player to start
all 30 games last year as a freshman. Pitt
is 0-7 without the sophomore guard.

Pitt ﬁnishes its season with seven
Big East conference games, starting with
home contests versus Georgetown and
West Virginia. The Hoyas come to the
Fitzgerald Field House on Wednesday at
7:30, and the Mountaineers face the
Lady Panthers in a Sunday matinee on
Feb. 9.

Smith, Gilpin pace Panthers
at George Mason Invitational

_H Moak

 

The Pitt men’s and women’s track
teams are still on a roll. Last Saturday’s
George Mason Invitational at Fairfax, Va.
was the Panthers’ latest stop.

Leading the way was sophomore stand-
out Trecia Smith. Smith qualiﬁed for the
NCAA championships in the long and triple
jumps very early in the year and has since
been concentrating on other events.
Saturday, she returned to her best events and
responded with her best performance so far
this season.

Smith had a long jump of 21 -2 1/2. The
jump is a new Pitt women’s record, break-
ing Smith’s own record of 20-10, set earlier
this season. The jump solidiﬁes Smith’s
position as the nation’s top female long
jumper this season. As if that weren’t
enough for one day, Smith also recorded the
nation’s best triple jump of the season at 43-
6 1/2.

“That’s just Trecia Smith,” said Pitt
Head Coach Steve Lewis. “She had an out-
standing day.”

There were plenty of good perfor-
mances to go around. Shana Fadis had a

 

couple of them. She ﬁnished ﬁfth in the 551-
meter hurdles and the 400 meters with tirnes
of 8.28 and 57.60 seconds respectively. The
times qualify Fadis for the ECAC champi-
onships in both events.

Chantee Earl and Angie Martin came
home from the meet winners in their events.
Earl took the 500 meters in 1:15.18, while
Martin won the 10()0 meters in 2:51.26.
Both are ECAC qualiﬁers.

The women’s distance medley relay
teams have been on a tear in the last two
weeks. After spending the two months of
the season trying to qualify for the ECAC
meet, they ﬁnally did it two weeks ago. Last
weekend, a completely different team qual-
iﬁed. Lynda Andros, Kianga Lee, Tamika
Donn, and Amy Francy qualiﬁed with their
third-place performance of 12:12.53. Their
performance proves that the event is one of
Pitt’s best. ,

“We have several options now. We can
safely and comfortably use any combination
of seven people on this team,” Lewis said.

Two weeks ago, Scott Curry became
the ﬁrst Pitt runner in nearly a decade to
qualify for the IC4A championships in the
1000 meters. Saturday, Scott Gilpin became

two, 36-34, as the buzzer sounded the
end of the half.

Pitt ﬂirted with the lead for the ﬁrst
seven minutes of the second half until
Mountaineer David Liguoii hit a three at
the 13:01 mark to extend West
Virginia’s lead to seven. Four more min-
utes of back-and-forth play later,
Cummings hit a basket to close the gap
to four, the closest the Panthers would
get for the rest of the contest.

After that, Pitt would score only
nine more points, while West Virginia
would light up the scoreboard for 20
more. West came off the bench to score
eight in that time period.

Coach Willard was optimistic about
Pitt’s recovery from this loss, though.

“I honestly believe we’ll bounce
back for Miami,” said the coach. The
Panthers and Hurricanes tip off in
Miarrii at 7:00 on Wednesday, Feb. 5.

The 167—pound weight class was a bat-

Pitt 22, Indiana 16

The Penn State match gave the 24th-
ranked Panthers a boost of conﬁdence which
propelled them to an upset victory over 19th-
ranked Indiana yesterday at Fitzgerald Field
House. ‘

Pitt dominated the contest, winning
seven of the 10 individual matches. Indiana
jumped out to an early 6-0 lead with a ﬁrst-
period pin by Derek Moscovic at the 118-
pound weight class.

Pitt immediately responded with a 3-2
win by Loper at 126 and a 4-2 by Jesko at
134. The two minor decisions knotted the
match at six. ,

Indiana’s Rodger Chandler, ranked sec-
ond in the nation, recorded the second ﬁrst-
period pin of the afternoon at 142. The pin
gained six. team points for the Hoosiers and
gave them a 12-6 lead.

An impressive 6-4 win by Kevin
Johnson at 150 cut Indiana’s lead to three.

Anescape was allthatSchaus neededto
secure his 1-0 victory at 158, and Withrow

stomped his opponent in a 7-2 win at 167,
giving Pitt 15-12 lead.

Iridiar1a’s usual 177-pounder, fourth-
ranked Mike Powell, did not make weight
for yesterday’s contest. Matusic destroyed
backup Aaron Delmar by way of a 16-5
major dmision.

Matusic controlled the match, recording
seven takedowns. All four of Delmar’s
points came from escapes in which Matusic
let him up so the two could battle on their
feet.

With the match tied at four after three
periods and sudden death, Bodo’s match
went into double overtime. Bodo rode his
opponent out in the period to secure the vic-
tory and lock up Pitt’s win by upping the
score to 22-12 heading into the ﬁnal match.

“I give Bodo all the credit in the world
for that  Stottlemyer said. “He fought
off a good shot in overtime and then rode the
guy out to get the victory.” -

NBA, MLS, and The Pill News sports briefing

from local services, wire ser-
vices and the armed services

Pro Basketball

-Detroit Piston , Grant
Hill earned NBA Player of
the Month‘ honors for
January, averaging a near-
triple-double (22.0 points, 9.7
boards, 7.9 assists) for the
month. Stephon Marbury of
the Minnesota Timberwolves
earned the Rookie of the
Month award, and Atlanta
Hawks Head Coach Lenny
Wilkins, whose team went
14-2 in January, took Coach

of the Month,
-The New York Knicks’
15-game home winning

streak was snapped Sunday,’

thanks to Glenn Rice and the
Charlotte Hornets. Rice
scored 40 points in a 99-93
Hornet win. John Starks’ 26
points led the Knicks, who
were without the injured
Patrick Ewing. In other
action, the Orlando Magic
beat the slumping, Charles
Barkley-less Houston
Rockets 103-90.

Ice Hockey

-Perhaps taking a cue
from the Pittsburgh Pirates,

the Pittsburgh Penguins are
considering a uniform
change. The block

“Pittsburgh” lettering may be
removed from the road jersey
in favor of a penguin graphic.

-Penguins Mario
Lemieux and Patrick
Lalime were awarded the
January NHL Player and
Goalie of the Month awards,
respectively.

Pro Soccer

°Local, , soccer stars

tal draft.

Column

for the Browns, he was considered one of
the top ﬁve receivers in the league. In
Cleveland he started off slow, and the fans
starting booing. Then, he opened his extra-
large mouth and got himself in more trouble
by spouting off about not getting enough
passes thrown his way. The Browns shipped
him off the next year, and he bounced
around for a while until Jacksonville
released him earlier this season.

Green Bay had lost their number one
wideout, Robert Brooks, for the year and
needed a replacement to compliment
Antonio Freeman and Don Beebe. The Pack
took a chance and signed Rison, and the rest
is Super Bowl history. He turned his play
and life around. The fans cheered him for
the ﬁrst time in years and now he doesn’t
want to leave.

Desmond Howard is also on this list of
lost careers turned around by the Pack.
Howard has been a bust in the NFL since he
won the Heisman at Michigan in 1991.
After being drafted by the Redskins and
signed to a high-priced deal, he couldn’t get
the job done. He was considered too small
and not tough enough to play receiver in the
NFL. After ﬁve sub-par seasons the Skins
released him, and some critics thought he
was destined for Canada

However, Packer Coach Mike
Holmgren thought differently and con-
vinced team management to sign Howard.
Used primarily as a punt and kick returner,
Howard dazzled in the postseason with two
long punt retrnns against the Forty—Niners
and, of course, the 99 yard kickoﬁ return in
the Super Bowl that was the dilference in the
game. He was the Super Bowl MVP, when
a few short months ago he was a has-been.

~ The number one reason for loving the
Pack is they don’t have any degenerate,
farne-hungry players like the Michael Irvins
of the world. Comparing the Packers and the
Cowboys is like comparing Star Wars and
Star Trek — you _can’t do it (sorry Trekkies,
but get real). Now Brett Favre did have an
abuse problem with  but he was
doing it to keep himself in games. For the
Cowboys, painkillers would be an appetizer
to a meal ﬁnished oﬂ° with breast of cocaine
and heroin pie. The Packers don’t do drugs
because they don’t need them. They get high
from playing for the best fans and the best
organization in the league.

Their end-zone celebration, although

., FROM PAGE I

 

.over-highlighted, encompasses what the

Packers are. In case you’ve been in a coma
for the past two football seasons, when a
Packer scores a touchdown, he drops the
ball and jumps into the stands behind the end
zone. As he rises in the air, the cheeseheads
catch and congratulate the scorer. It is a pic-
turesque sight and is 10 times better than the
Deion Dance, a mixture of a jig and the
Rockettes.

The Packers are the best team in the
league, and they have become that team
through a belief in the players. strong team-
work. and an obvious awareness of their
fans.

News.
