Speaker sees  

rise in terrorism

By Vincent Murphy
The "Pitt News

“How we react to terrorism will‘
shape our future,” said Col. Richard
Crabtree of the U.S. Air Force
Office of Special Investigations.
Crabtree presented GSPIA students
Wednesday with his report on possi-
ble retaliation against state-
supported terrorist activity. “I983
stood out as a year of unsurpassed
violence," said Crabtree, in refer-
ence to the increase of terrorism
worldwide as a form of small-scale
warfare..

Crabtree, who is presently an
Officer Research Associate at
GSPIA, stressed that terrorism is
nothing new, but has recently grown
at an alarming rate as an alternative
to conventional warfare. He also
stressed how important retaliation
against terrorist activity in its pres-
ent form has become as a result.

“The Soyiet Union has been sup-
porting international terrorism for
years," state_d_Crabtree. “There are
about 13-14 terrorist training camps
inside the U.S.S.R." Terrorism, he
went on to say, supplied the Soviet
Union with warfare that was much
cheaper and simpler than engaging
in conventional tactics.

When a student asked why terror-
ism is rare inside the United States,
Crabtree answered that, in truth, it
exists to a higher extent than the
average citizen is aware of. During

“ the period of 1963-83, he said, “The

U.S. ranked third in the world" for
terrorist activity, but publicizing this
would only feed the trend. “It kills
only a few.and intimidates millions,”
said Crabtree, stating that one rea-
.son for the relative nonexistence of
terrorism inside the Soviet Union is
the lack of publicity of a terrorist
event.

According to Crabtree, the poten-
tial for new, more destructive terror-
ism is
well-funded national groups. He
mentioned the possibilities of chemi-
cal and nuclear terrorism due to the
increased availability of required
materials. “We’re being naive as a
world community to say that it will

never happen," he said. “As soon as
terrorists lose their psychological
impact, they will turn to these alter-
natives.” Crabtree mentioned many
new forms of terrorism which could
be a threat to the American public.
For example, the act of releasing a

small amount of nerve‘ gas in an
enclosed‘ structure, such as a super-
dome, could have catastrophic con-

great, especially for,

sequences, he said. “This is not to
make people paranoid, it’s just to
discuss the possibility,” remarked
Crabtree.

Crabtree eventually remarked on
the U.S.’s role in discouraging state-
supported communism. “The U.S.
has been reluctant to supply re-

sources to real with terrorism proba- ' '

bly because they hoped it was
temporary,” he said. He mentioned
that indecision in the United .
Nations for the past 50 years on how
terrorism should be dealt with has
not helped the United States in
handling the problem.

“We're ill-equipped to fight ter-
rorism," stated Crabtree, mention-
ing that the United States'bad image
in reacting to terrorist situations
could be a direct result of such inci-
dents as the attempted rescue of the
hostages in Iran.

Crabtree suggested direct action
against those nations supporting ter-
rorism. One such effective action,ihe
said, would be to “isolate a country
that actively supports terrorism,
either economically or politically."

‘Another alternative, he stated,

would be to “fight fire with fire use .-

force."

In aggressive retaliation, how-
ever, Crabtree felt that the words of
Secretary of State George Schultz
should be considered: “We must
always keep in mind the values we
are trying to protect." Crabtree felt
that more power must be given. to
U.S. intelligence in order to identify

terrorists and avoid persecution of
innocent citizens. “Domestically,
we're hurting," he said, referringto a
limitation placed upon the FBI in
1976 that allowed the agency to inﬁl-
trate an area in question only ifthere
were proof of a terrorist act. “Even
with an overt team you have to know
what and where to attack," he said.

One distressed student disagreed
with Crabtree’s aggressive philoso-
phy at Wednesday’s meeting.
“Maybe we should address it by ask-
ing: why did they do this?” she said.
“We’re not recognizing the intrica-
cies of the problem." She suggested

that there are reasons people go to .

the extent of terrorism — for
instance, in order to make their
views known.

Crabtree asserted that not all
groups represented state or political
organizations and that dealing with
dangerous situations required inves-
tigation. Freedom of intelligence, he
added, was a matter of “weighing
civil rights and rights to privacy
against society's right to protect
itself."

Nicholas Pennell plays to his audience

 

Dan Mottsan/ e Piii News

By Greg Evanina
The Pitt News

On Wednesday evening at the
Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre,
the audience was treated to one of
today’s most accomplished actors.
Nicholas Pennell, who is mainly
known for Shakespearean drama,
showed his talent not only included
Shakespearean roles but also char-
acterizations from many other
forms of literature.

Even as the audience was filing

into the theatre, Pennell, in a some- '

what unusual move, was already
onstage setting the mood — busily
composing over a typewriter. That
served to establish a rapport with the
audie_nce.

Will computers start World War
III? “The chances of that happening
are very remote," says retired Admi-
ral Larry Chambers.

Chambers, a veteran ﬁghter pilot, 0

battle group commander and wea-
pons systems project manager,
spoke to the Computer Profession-
als for Social Responsibility, Tues-
day night in Skibo Hall of Carnegie
Mellon University.

As a’ matter of fact, Pennell was
not very serious. Granted, the play is
not of a formal nature. It is riddled
with humor. Pennell seems to be
quite a humorist himself. It’s no
wonder that he co-wrote “A Varia-
ble Passion." Pennell admits this
play reflects part of himself, as does
every other play he performs in.
What we see onstage is more of
Nicholas Pennell than “A Variable
Passion.” And this is where the basic
fault of the play lies.

In “A Variable Passion," Pennell
portrays David Frank, a Canadian
college professor preparing a pro-

- gram of romantic verse for his stu-

dents. As he reads these excerpts to
the audience, we begin to see that the
selections reflect Frank’s attitudes
on love and all its inherent joys and
pitfalls. From the _ beginning,

warfare are exaggerated. The chan-
cos of our computers starting a
nuclear war are minimal,"
Chambers said. “As for the Russian
computers, we don't know. False
alarms can be good, because it keeps
our men on their toes. They run
drills that accomplish the same
thing," he said. '

Chambers explained that he felt
the only way to deal with the Rus-
sians is from a position of strength.
“They don’t think in western terms,"
he said. “They are paranoid, and
they won't feel comfortable until
they have superiority in every mil-

  

 

 

Frank’s cynicism at the prospect of
love becomes obvious.
Throughout Act I, excerpts
drawn from Genesis, Shakespeare,
Keats and Woody Allen, among
others, help Frank to show his bitter
distaste for love. He takes the
audience through all the various

, stages of love such as innocent love,

passion, lust, physical love and mar-
riage. Just as he builds the stages of
love, he builds the emotions sur-
rounding it until the act climaxes
with a passage of Judith Vior.st’s in
which a man murders his wife.

Just as the audience is left a bit
confused at the end of the first act,
we begin to find out Frank’s motives
and reasons for despising love in Act
2. .

He stumbles onstage after return-
ing from a party. He begins to pour
his heart out to the audience, saying,
that he met his wife at a similar
party. He also mentions that he met
the other woman at aparty. It was
when he was with this other woman
in bed that his wife happened to
walk in on them. Hence, the reason
for the divorce. Now, the audience
may assume that the divorce just
could be the reason for Frank’s cyni-
cism. After Frank recites a few more
passages -dealing with the other

woman and the pains of love, he_

reaches the final passage.

The excerpt is entitled “The Diary
of Adam and Eve.” It begins on a
Monday with Adam complaining
about this new person, Eve. He says
she gets in the way, she names every-
thing and she causes him ‘a lot of
work.

' But, along comes something else
— a baby, Cain. Adam, in his diary,

arrival has made the change in
Adam. He grudgingly begins to pick
out Eve's good points. He revels in

her beauty. He realizes she’ll help‘

with the work. And, finally, he dis-
covers that life in The Garden of
Eden is much less lonely since she
came. -

Even though she entices him into

Chambers also said that with so
many touchy spots around the world
we should continue to build up our
conventional forces. “In a war, a
country would be more apt to use
nuclear weapons if they were far out-
numbered ‘in conventional weap-
ons,” Chambers said.

Chambers also felt that unilateral
disarmament is not possible. “I
wouldn’t trust the Russians. The
best way to deal with them is to build
enough weapons so they will respect
us, and will want to negotiate with
us,” he said.

eating the Forbidden Fruit, Adam
admits that he was hungry and con-
cludes that, although life in the
Garden was nice, it is better to live
outside with Eve than to live inside
without her.

This passage becomes the turning
point in the play. Frank, in order to
let the audience know that he has
resolved his problem with love, exits
the stage saying, “Wheresoever she
was, there was Eden.” ~

To all outward appearances, “A
Variable Passion” is excellent. Pen-
nell, true, to his reputation, is a
wonderful example of talent. He de-
livered his lines almost ﬂawlessly
and showed his uncanny knack at
role variation. Without a doubt, he
is one of the finest actors ever to
come to Pittsburgh. However, as
good an actor as Pennell is, histalent
for performing is not equaled by his
ability to write plays. -

Just for the record, “A Variable
Passion” was created after someone
suggested Pennell build a plot
around readings he used in his lec-
tures. He and Elliot Hayes sat down

and intertwined a plot around these .

readings, which became -known as
“A Variable Passion."

That may have been a good idea.
But several questions arise when
considering the storyline. For
instance, why mock'love and its
virtues only to conclude that it is
wonderful? There is such a disparity

between the first and second acts '

that it seems two separate plays have
been fitted together to make one.
Another problem with the plot

manifests itself at the onset of the
second act. Frank stumbles in drunk
and commences to inform, the
audience of the details of his affair.
He then reads a passage about “The
Other Woman” and later speaks of
his ladyfriend who wants to commit
suicide because her husband left her.

Since these two excerpts are
inconsequential to the rest of the
play,” they could have gone unsaid
without much effect on the storyline.
As a matter of fact, the two passages
tended to stop the action and bore
the audience.

Although the plot has its weak-
nesses, one must think of a play as
accomplishing that for which it is
intended —— entertainment. Superfi-
cially, “A Variable Passion” is fine.
It does star the famous Stratford
Festival’s premier actor. ‘

-  The    variable I passionicsir Nicholas    Pennell

The concept that good (or bad)
acting can overshadow the play,
itself, holds true in this instance. If
you went to see Nicholas Pennell,
then you left Stephen Foster quite

satisfied. But, if you tended to con- '

centrate on what he was so elo-
quently discussing, you would not
have been as satisfied. I

Perhaps Pennell best understands
the reason for the play’s success.
When he asked what he does in “A
Variable Passion,” he said, “I start
talking at 8 [p.m.] and I stop talking
at quarter-to-ten.” ‘

Without Nichloas Pennell doing
all the talking, “A Variable Passion”
might be more accurately named “A
Veritable Bore.”

The "medical and‘moral decisions
of pfpro-life versus pro-choice were
discussed Wednesday night at a lec-
ture sponsored by the Pitt Students
for Life. Dr. Richard McGarvey
spoke on behalf of the_ medical
dangers, ethics and emotions

involved in abortion, while Mary ,

Bettingfield, of Women Exploited, a
self-help agency for women who
have had abortions, discussed the

emotions a woman encounters after _ .

she has had an abortion.

Dr. McGarvey said while he is'not
in favor of abortion ‘to end an
unplanned pregnancy, he does not
believe thata woman who is the vic-
tim of incest or rape should have to
carry the. child. McGarvey argued
that abortion is not the answer to a
social problem and said that it may,
in fact, worsen the problem.

topic of debate between pro-life and
pro-choice groups for quite a while.
Dr. McGarvey addressed the ques-
tion ofwhether a‘ fetus is a person by
saying that the last definition by a
pro-choice group of a person is “a
living human individual,” although
he said he has ye_t to hear a truly
good definition. He added that the
human being begins to be a unique
individual when the DNA is formed
at conception. “

McGarvey also questioned the
idea" of the fetus being a part of the
mother. He stated that a baby born
at 22 weeks has a 20 percent chance
of survival living in an intensive care

unit. Yet, the legal cut-off date for a

woman to have an abortion is 361
weeks. He also pointed out that

although'the fetus gets nutrition to

sustain itself while it is within the

mother’s womb, the fetus can also be

nourished artificially.

McGarvey said he also had a
problem with the centers them-
selves. He said that they do very little
to warn the patients of the possible
dangers or complications that may
surface following an abortion. He
said that the literature distributed by

the pro-choice organizations usually ’

does not include the possible health

' risks a woman may face. He saw a

problem with the few (follow-up vis-

has been performed. Since the cen-
ters have limited hours, if a problem
should occur, the woman would

 A Call toArms

-Time after time, we complain and criticize “the university”
on lines of administrative procedure. We tell our relatives that
we “go to Pitt” and that we will graduate with a degree from the
University of Pittsburgh. What is “the university”?

ii‘ Consistently, and especially concerning the proposal to dis-
solve GSPIA, we attack “the university” for acting against our
interests. Why is it so difficult to understand that we, the
students and faculty, are the dynamic elements of this institu-

. tion? We comprise “the university.” Without our interests, our
’ thoughts, our motivation and our money, the University of

Pittsburgh would be a useless apparatus, little more than a
lame sketch in the ideal realm of form. —

President Posvar, Provost Benjamin, the Board of Trustees
and private investors are not the university. Granted, students
depend upon the resources graciously provided by the honora-
ble administrative arm. Yet it is we, the students, faculty and
staff, that constitute the body (the part with the heart of the
matter) that permits that arm to function. We are its raison
d’etre.

It has been shown in the past which parts of this whole weigh
heaviest and which groups have access to which resources.
Standard operating procedures and bureaucratic red tape too
often discourage students from the responsibility of accounting
for the use of our resources, thereby giving the university
administration unquestioned, control in the planning and
spending of our funds and energies. .

if we care enough to thoughtfully choose our courses each
term, design majors and make meaningful life decisions, why

do we not similarly care when administrative plans are put in-

process, withoutyour consent, to impose radical changes upon
the structure through which we achieve those goals? If we,
students and faculty, make up the dynamic collectivity of this
institution, why aren’t such radical changes as the possible

dissolution of GSPIA brought about by or pursued through
‘ us? Because this is the state of affairs we have unintentionally

encouraged. .

The Ad Hoc Committee of the GSPIA Student Cabinet has
recognized this dilemma and has appropriately drafted a l0-
page response to the proposed organizational changes aimed at

their school. They have shown a willingness to accept the

responsibility of evaluating and confronting serious adminis-
trative problems through mature and intelligent means.
Rather than respond in an emotional and careless manner,

these graduate students have successfully applied what they’ve ' p
V learned through GSPIA. It is hoped that their action be recog- . _
nized as a reflection of the quality and pride embodied in the '

Graduate School of Public and International Affairs.

Letters to the Editor

GSPIA Students Challenge Provost’s Proposal

I graduated from the University
of Pittsburgh“ in December 1983,
and, thus, became a member of ‘the
ever-growing body of Pitt alumni.
Claiming that I now have a duty “to
return what others gave to me," the
university has placed me on the
mailing list of its Annual Giving
Fund. This “fund provides the
money that enables deans to imple-
ment ideas and programs that will

improve their schools and for which I

there are no other funds available.”

Fine —- except when one notes
that the brochure accompanying the
contribution card, as part of its
means of persuading alumni to con-
tribute, stated the following: “Peer
evaluation surveys have ranked the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs eighth in repu-
tation among the nation's schools of
public administration ...” As is well
known, the university is currently

discussing the dissolution of this.

school. Yes, that’s right, the’ very
school it so proudly brags about to
all its alumni. '

As a second’-year GSPIA student
planning to graduate in April, I take
extreme offense at this shame/fully

.misleading fund—raising campaign.

How dare the university continue to
criticize GSPIA and its faculty only
to turn around and praise it when it
appears t.o be beneficial to its‘ own
interests, . , -
Although the ‘university's task
force chose to ignore it in itsanalysis
of the se_hool’s quality, .-in this

_ instance, it ‘seems apparent that the
- university is well aware of the ‘power

the GSPIA name has and its exten-
sive local, regional, national and
international ties. ’ .
The task force that was commis-
sioned claimed GSPIA ,had “low
scholastic productivity" and was
convinced that any changeswithin
the school —— even if they involved
the “demise" of such programs as
Economicsof Social Development,

Masters of Urban and Regional

Planning and International Affairs
programs — would bring nothing
but improvement. Such conclusions
are direct contradictions to the fore-
mentioned university praise of
GSPIA, as well as general knowl-
edge. Maybe this is due to the
method of analysisthe task force
utilized. ‘
According to Provost Benjamin,
th_e task force's conclusions were

, based on only one index —- scholas-

tic productivity.’ This ‘index sup-
posedly ranks schools’ according to
the number of times faculty

[members had either published
..WO.fk.§'.or ‘were mﬁntjqned or quoted

  

by other scholars. What the task
force did not recall in its application
of this index is the inherent incom-
patibilityof placing stress upon both
high educational standards and high
levels of faculty research and
publication. -

If there is “low scholastic produc-
tivity” at GSPIA, a point which is
still in contention, I believe it should
be viewed tmore as a point in

V GSPIA’s favor. From experience,
' moststudents can attest to the fact

that when professors become in-
tensely involved in their own
research work so as to gain the per-
sonal notoriety the university
appears to desire, they tend not to be
available as often as students would
like. The educational quality of lec-
tures also declines due to the profes-
sor‘s tendency to either continuously
discuss his research or relate all
other classroom material to it.
Faculty members are human
beings with human limitations. The
fact that they can't do everything at
once is not through fault. of their

_own, but rather due to the i_nherent '

faults within the academic system.
In conclusion, it must be added-that
the authors of the ranking index the
task force used specifically stated
that their “productivity measure is
somehow inappropriate to such out-

standing schools of public adminis-

tration as Syracuse and Pittsburgh."
The point being made is that if the

task force was going to base its _
‘assessment on previously devised T
rankings, maybe it should have

looked at a few more. y
Four other recent rankings that

could have been used are as follows: ‘
l) reputation according to 118,

deans/ department heads —— GSPIA
ranked 8 out of 2l6; 2) reputation
according to 338 public administra-
tors -- GSPIA ranked 13 out of 50;

_ 3) reputation according‘ to articles
a published in prominent journals on
-“administration'-’ and “policy" —

GSPIA ranked 12 out of 53. _
These rankings present quite a dif-

, ferent picture of GSPIA. Why were

they subsequently ignored? Atlwhat
point did “proper policy analysis”
come to rest on ill-fitting data and

fail to take in morethan twoa1terna- ’

tives: i) keep the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs; or

2) dissolve the Graduate School of ’

Public and International Affairs?

growth” with 29,517 alumni and
friends of the university contribut-
ing over $2,764,028. P ‘

I think ofallthe GSPIA alumni
that are currently writing their
checks with little knowledge of the
fact that the educational quality of
the school from which their degrees
were. granted has been sorely
compromised.

What the University of Pittsburgh
is doing is a disgrace. Thank God
that, at least, the suggestion to dis-
solve GSPIA, according to Provost
Benjamin, is only tentative. ‘

The Graduate School_of Public
and International Affairs is a first-
rate school with a reputation that
has brought it praise from around
the globe. Dissolution of such a
school-would be a great mistake. As
their evaluation process continues,
I'm sure the university's task force
will reach the same conclusion.

deeply concerned about all-the issues

 There are others in GSPIA who, ‘

I'm sure, have already written to you
at length summarizing the opinions
of GSPIA students, better than I
could, have. Therefore, I will make
only one point. It seems clear to me,
and I’m sure others agree, that uni-

versity politics and perhaps some '

personal vendettas against GSPIA,
or certain individuals at GS PIA, are
playing key roles, if not the key role,
in this affair.

highly political environment. -You

Body Double: Making of a thriller .

by Bryan I. Fischer

"Body Double is a picture I've been
wanting to make for \a long time,"
offered director Brian De Palma dur-
ing the shooting for his latest release.
"This is going to be the most erotic,
thrilling movie I know how to make."

Unfortunately, it is De Palma’s fas-
cination with cinematic sex and vio-
lence that is the most frightening

factor left for the viewer to’consider.—

after seeing the director's latest
‘murder-mystery.’

In spite of some interesting plot
conceptions and one truly developed
character, Body Double is consumed by
execution that ranges from unlikely
to unbelievable and, finally,
unbearable. '

Frequently reminiscent of Hitch-
cock — from the voyeurism theme of
Rear Window, to camera angles lifted
straight from Vertigo —-— De Palma fails
to rise above the crowded field in
what he is reputed to do best —
suspense.

The Hitchcock tag has been a mon-
key on De Palma’s back since he

. directed his first thriller more than a

decade ago. Since that time he has
filled theaters with pictures like Car-

«rie, Dressed to Kill, Blow Out and last

year's Scarface. Although respectful of
the master, De Palma is nevertheless
irritated by the insinuation that he is
a Hitchcock clone.

"By makingiall the films Hitchcock
did, he pioneered all the great tense
storylines," De Palma said at a recent
New York screening of Body Double.
”If you're going to make a movie in
this genre you would be stupid not to
use some of the stuff he pioneered.”

DDUEIEI

Roughly stated, Body Double deals
with a struggling actor in Los
Angeles who has lost his girlfriend
and his job,iyet finds himself set up by
a. friend in a space-age Hollywood
Hills house, complete with a view of
an erotic dancing nymphet neighbor.
The fact of the matter, of course, is
that poor, struggling Jake Scully
(Craig Wasson) has has been set up —-
to witness his neighbor's murder.

In attempting to unlock the mys-
tery, Jake engages in a career in.por—
nography, where he attempts to

 

enlist the services of his co—star to

clear up this messy murder situation.

After a frantic encounter wherein
Jake attempts to explain the inexpli-
cable, porn queen Holly Body
(Melanie Griffith) is picked up by the
bad guy, ushering in the unbearable,
post haste. -

A melodramatic and uninteresting
wrap finds Jake, whose claustropho-

times,_ finally "acting" and voila ...!-All
the confusing pieces suddenly fit. Or
do. they? . ‘

Spread liberally throughout the
story, but particularly after Gloria
Revelle’s (Deborah Shelton) graphic

=murder, De Palma’s preoccupation V

with pornography -is both explicit and
excessive.

"The intention is to tell the story
with exactly the right things at the
right times,” the 44-year-old De

bia has plagued ‘him at all the wrong shooting the film t_ht same day —

 

Melanie Griffith and Craig Wasson star in Body Double‘

Palma patiently explained to skeptics
at the screening. "We don't sit around
in boardrooms and say where are we
gonna put the sex scenes, where we
gonna put the violent scene.”

Even so, from the time Gloria's
murder’ launches Jake’ on his far-
fetched porn career — another
"actor" has waited all day to read a
script for the director; Jake begins

not only are the the scenes saturated
with sensuality, but it all seems dis-
turbingly pointless. ‘ S

"The pornography should get you
off. That's what it's intended to do,"
De’ ‘Palma explained. At the same
time, charges of overindulgence don't
play well with the director. He sees
that distinction as "a very personal
kind of judgment. To me it's just the

i right amount."

  
   

CIEJDEIEI

If you haven't gathered as much
already, all too much of what goes on
in Body Double is unbelievable and
though some of the storyline is
rather interesting (for instance, De
Palma manipulates the effect of film.
within film quite cleverly), in
attempting to pull it all off, three of
the film's four major characters are
insufferably one-dimensional. ,

”If you can't relate to the charac-
ters, then the movie won't.work for
you," De Palma offered. All too often
that is precisely what happens.

Although Melanie Griffith is
wonderful as porno flick star Holly
Body, the film revolves around Craig
Wasson’s Jake Scully who often
seems as dumbfounded ‘by De Pal-
ma’s improbable plot twists as might
be expected of the audience.

Deborah Shelton is inexcusably
shallow as Jake's murdered neighbor;
what few lines she has before her

gruesome undoing are delivered so_

poorly that her eventual fate comes
almost as a relief. . I

Sam Bouchard . (Gregg Henry),
who befriends Jake almost from the
film's outset, does alright — until we
find out just how ridiculous his part
has actually been.

Danna

In the end, a Brian De Palma film is
judged (hopefully) like any other —
on its ability to stir up emotion in the
viewer, to create identification with
its characters, on merit.

Built on an improbable premise,
and in spite of some textural achieve-
ments, Body Double fails on account of
three main characters‘ who fail to .
strike a chord and, in fac , seem ‘at
times manipulated into erotic scenes
intended for littlemore than shock
value. '

"You've got to stand by what you
do," is Brian De Palma’s response to
the reaction his films sometimes get.
”Some people are not going to likeit
and will have a strong reaction. I

- make movies to please myself first of

all." ' . ’

Having made the film he's been

gwanting to make for so long, De

Palma might think about letting us all
enjoy his next effort.

No earth shaking affair

by Leslie Bennett

There's something appealing about
a rosy-cheeked awkward adolescent
who can suavely shake ‘hands and
introduce himself as "Charles Cum-
mings, in case you're wondering

. whose mother you had your way

with." And Jon Cryer plays Charles in
No Small Affair not with a smart-

.alecky schoolboy smirk, but with

charming sensitivity.
Charles is a precocious 16-year-old
amateur photographer who is

' obsessed, if not inspired, by every vis-

ual detail of his San Francisco envi-

' ronment —— including‘cracks in the

sidewalk and street cleaners. Then

extremely photogenic older woman
whom he inadvertently captures on
film and subsequently falls head over
heels for. Demi Moore plays this 23-

year-old would-be‘ rock singer, down ,

on her luck, but high onambition.
Though the film centers on what
could be a silly fantasy romance, it
sustains a quirky humor and suc-
ceeds, for the most part, in its unpre-

. dictability. It has its moments of

mush, but it keeps them reasonably

solid .and straightforward: '’I love -

you," says Charles Cryer, then adds,
"I didn't want to say that. I didn't
want to be corny or anything."

The result is something mcire than

Jerry Schatzberg, and introduces .

both performers in their first star-
ring film roles. Moore, known to tele-
vision audiences as "General
Hospital's” Jackie Templeton, por-
trays Laura Victor effectively, but it's
hard, to specify praise beyond that.

{She's got the raspy voice, tousled hair

and pouty lips that we'd expect from a
club singer who lives in a paint-
splattered loft apartment and wears
bangles up to her elbows.

All things considered, however,
Jon Cryer is the star of this film. He

starts out to be the off-beat, self-4

concerned, kid whose sole motiveis to
save $8,642. and to grow up.

Nineteen-year’-old Cryer, who made’

his Broadway debut in the Tony-

award- winning Torch Song Trilogy,

seems so in tune_ with his character

may seem a bit sappy, but laterit only
adds to the dry humor. I

Ann Wedgeworth gives a worthy
performance of Charles’ incompetent‘
and amusingly frazzled mother. Jef-
frey Tambour is the balding boy-
friend Charles teasingly refers .to as
"Uncle ’ Ken-,"‘ and George Wendt
(Cheers) plays‘ the club owner, Jake.

Two notably strong assets of the
film are the original musical scores

‘directed and composed by Rupert g

Holmes and Oscar-winning Vilmos
Zsigmond's photographic sequences
which lend a colorful gloss to.the
wharves and hills of San Francisco.
It can't be argued that No Small
Affair is another coming-of-age story,
which heaps it intoea pile of soon-to-

be-forgotten Hollywood films of the\

by Michael Selz

To say disparaging things about
the film Country because it happened
to be released in the same season as
Places in the Heart and The River is to
miss the point. _

Yes, all three films dramatize the
plight of the American farmers in
their battles against nature and
government bureaucracy, but it is a
legitimate subject that

land. It's not what you'd call sexy.
However, it does say something about

‘the ease with which Hollywood

trends are born. Farm film — a new
genre. It rolls off the tongue like
Cream of Wheat. 1

Jessica Lange, co-star and co-

_ producer, plays Jewell Ivy. She, her

father Otis (Wilford Brimley), her
husband Gil (Sam Shepard) and her
three children live on a farm, that's
been in her family for generations.
Like most modern-day’ farmers,
they've remedied government-
induced unprofitlability with govern-
ment subsidy —— huge loans from the
FHA (Farmer's Home Administra-
tion), offered without restraint.

Suddenly, the FHA realizes that’

their chances_of collecting on these
loans are slim. A government agent

with the disposition of a barracuda is .

dispatched ‘to the local FHA office to

get nasty. ”Just show ’em they can't '

make it farming anymore — they'll
go," he says to the kindly and naive
local official. The stage is set. The
good guys and the bad guys are
clearly labeled and distinguishable
from three pastures away.

Sam Shepard plays himself with his
usual fiercely masculine, quiet inten-

courageous a heroine that you'll want

on the phone about her delinquent
loans. "We really just don't under-
stand  You said ’Catch ’em up,’ and
we're gonna do that." She pulls your
heart out.

In another instance, -as a govern-
ment sheepdog runs around a farm-

yard herding repossessed sheep into a ,

trailer, Jewell runs counter paths,
scattering sheep to thwart the dog's
efforts. In all its ridiculousness, this
scene still makes you want to cheer.

Otis, isa terrific character actor who .

diverges from the stereotypical cute
oldcodger. In Country, he blames his
son-in-law for borrowing money in
the first place, exploding the tension
finally by stating bitterly, "I wish
you'd, a never set foot on this farm."

Cowboy is the son of another
farmer in the same jam.». He is
retarded, but has a keenness of per-
ception, visible in his blue eyes, that
says he's not out of touch with the
world — he sees too much, too
acutely and his desperate ways of
dealing with the world become pivot-
al in the film. '

The cinematography is at turns
lyrical and picturesque — taking
advantage of the landscape — and
sometimes documentary-like in its
attention to mundane detail. This is
most noticeable in the close-ups of
food being prepared in the family kit-
chen. This works in its favor, giving
the film an immediacy and currency
that bring its heroic prop‘ortions
down to a size the audience can‘better
deal with.

‘ SOME GREAT REWARD
Depeche Mode
Sire Records

Depeche Mode present a
problem. Their fourth album of
new material — Some Great
Reward — has just hit the record
stores, and one spin of this disk
reveals that the British
quartet’s instrumental prowess
has grown by leaps: they prove
themselves to be the unques-
tionable pack-leader of synthe-
sized bands. Increasingly
intricate in design, their music
fascinates and seems to expand
the inherent limitations of the
computer. But therein lies the
difficulty. 

Some Great Reward takes full
advantage of stereo ——, produc-
tion is wide open, as tzlean and
sharp as cut glass. Sojproficient
and unerringly precise is the
music that it calls attention to
itself too often. The style of
presentation overshadows the
content, although the basic DM
sound survives intact: pleasing

 

Showcase, «Friday, November 16,1 1984

  Sum of its parts

melodic hooks and serviceable,
introspective lyrics (dealing
‘with interpersonal relation-
ships) layered over incessant
dance rhythms. The character-
istically antiseptic vocals +
devoid of emotional com-
mitment — seem appropriate

A for the medium of electric pop.

But the artistry of group
members Martin Gore,’ Alan
Wilder, David Gahan and

. Andrew Fletcher has caught up

with chief ' songwriter Gore's
pop sensibility, and Some Great
Reward becomes a race_to the fin-
ish with an uncertain winner.
Behind the wondrous wall of
production lurk nine songs, and
some of them quite good — the
ballad ”It Doesn't Matter," for
example, and ”Stories of Old”
are state-of-the-art, catchy,
slick and suburban.

Strategic and expertly syn-
thesized industrial sound
effects embellish the material,
propelling the terrific ”People
are People” into near-classic ter-

damages ”Blasphemous Rum-
ours” only slightly, and wise
folks will ignore the lyrics for ”If
You Want" and ”Master and
Servant” and just dance. ”Some-

‘ body” offers an exception and a

surprise: ”She will listen’ to me!
When I want to speakl About
the worldjwe live inl And life in
general,” rather stunningly
accompanied by (genuine) solo
piano — startling, effective,
beautiful. _ s
‘The fact remains, however,

ritory. A heavy-handed plot '

 

that Depeche Mode's skillful
production and execution of
musical ideas provide more
interest than the actual songs as
words-and-music sets. An

"t unusual case of the sum of the

parts being greater than the
whole, sort of, and a singular
problem. Still, the album —
technologically brilliant and
compulsively listenable -
offers some pleasant if not great
rewards.

FAMILY MAN
Black Flag
SST

It never fails. Just when
you're about to break down and
concede that a hardcore band
may possess a scrambled sense
of social relevance, some
redeeming spirit that raises
them above 'the'trash'hea'p occu-
pied by their peers, they release
the disc. that does them in. Sub-
mitted for your misery — Black
Flag’s Family Man — a ”spoken
word/instrumental. record.”
Just what we all need. Another
malevolent statement from 'the
passionately bleak underbelly of
this excessively bourgeois
nation.

To be brutally honest, as a
whole, the album is horrendous.
One entire side is devoted to the
creation of noise, a painful exhi-
bition of the type of sound that

any of a multitude of garage 7

bands could produce, all better
left in the garage like a collec-
tion of '60s outtakes from the
relentless Amboy Dukes—
crude, amateurish and,
moreover, boring. ‘

The balance of the album is a
choppy set of juvenile ramblings
pawned off as poetry. Forget all
of the instrumentals. Forget all
of the ”poetry,” save the title
track, the only interesting piece
of work on the whole record.
Here we have Henry Rollins’
personal indictment of the mid-
dle class he has come to view
with disdain: ”Family manl
Family manl I want to crucify
you on your front door! With
nails from your well-stocked
garagel Family manl Family
manl Family manl Saint Dad,
father on fire! I've come to
incinerate you! I've ‘come
home.” . .

caught up in his own brand of
cynicism, playing the role of the

ceptable. At times, such individ-

uals form a kind of~collective
conscience for their parent
society, But in the case of R01-
lins,‘ these ostentatious exer-
cises totally blow his cover.

sheep who would just as com-

reinforced their negativism,

reticence and basic fear of the '

world tljat bore them, he"d offer
solutions or at least a divergent
tortured perspective. But

years.

Legend has it that the ancient
Greek cynic Diogenes begged
for money from a statue to get
used to being turned down, but
even "he walked symbolically
about Greece carrying a lantern
in search of an ”honest man.”
Henry Rollins isn't looking for
anything except a mirror to
check his image. Intense
enough? Obnoxious enough?
Wouldn't it be great to be Jim
Morrison? A

He isn't a Socrates gone mad.
He's a punk. Not in the stylized
sense, but literally. Go recite
your bullshit to a statue. May
the pigeons treat you both the
same.

both ep’s a must. The Flying

Who'll stop the rain?

' THE RAIN PARADE

T/he Decade
November 12, 1984

by Paul Anderson
A lot of people seem to think that

unless you're tripping on acid, psy-
chedelic bands are dull andrepetitive

\ to the ear and particularly boring to

   

watch. A lot of people are wrong.
Those who witnessed the L.A.-based
Rain Parade at the Decad_e on Mon-
day night know just how uplifting a

_ good ”head" band can be.

One characteristic of this neo-
psychedelic craze is that everyone
likes to guess who the bands emulate.
At the Decade, we heard people say-
ing that Rain Parade sounds like
1966-era Beatles, Buffalo Spring-
field, the Byrds, Television, Pink
Floyd and Green on Red. But wait,

. this band has its own sound.

The Rain Parade sound features
sleek harmonies, melodic tunes and

strange guitar playing. Matt Piuccu,

lead singer and vocalist, plays guitar
like Neil Young, very forceful

melodic picking based on a droning .

chord. So songs had sitar-like lead

. riffs. "

The Rain Parade is neat to watch
because they play such a diverse vari-
ety of songs. Some wereacoustic,
fclky and very pretty. Others were
drony and spacey with lots of fuzz,

and they occasionally add a schizo-
phrenic element within a single song.
Some of the tunes had drastic tempo
changes, which made it seem as
though the band had just ventured
into a time warp.

Low-key is the work to describe
their theatrics. Some of us are very
impressed when musicians don't
spend their energy posturing like
Tarzan or some ancient Greek thes-
pian. Bassist Steven Roback’s ”sweet-
as-syrup" voice is every bit as
ethereal as his appearance. He swings
his bass and body to the beat just like
the characters in the title sequence of
”The Archies" and steps like a slow
motion Rastaman.

We got to rap with these guys after

the show. It was obvious the band's_

psychedelic sincerity is just as
genuine in‘ their personalities as in
their music. A

picious finale at Carnegie Music Hall.

The event began, after much offi-
cial collegiate chatter, with the fea-
tured artists assembled on stage. Dr.
Nathan Davis, Freddie Hubbard,
Peter Erskine, Emily Remler, Ron
Carter and Cedar Walton began the
night with two lengthy jams.

' Pitt's very ‘own Nathan Davis,
dressed to the hilt in .a shiny black
suit, performed on tenor saxophone.
His solos were often bluesy, always
played at light speed velocity and
sometimes descended to be brash. His
style was most appropriate on the
first’tune of the evening, ”Sticks" by
Cannonball‘Adderly, a straight ahead
prototypical standard.

Freddie Hubbard eagerly displayed L

the chops that have put him near the
apex of contemporary jazz trumpet-
ing. Slyly beginning some solos by
mimicking the subdued Miles Davis,
he would progress to the inimitable
”Freddie Hubbard Sound.”

- Emily Remler consistently deli- .

vered perfect rhythm accompani-
ment and absorbing solos. Her
eclectic improvisations, echoed by the
memory of the late great Wes Mont-
gomery, played with a rich bassy
tone, but also incorporated the drama
of more recent players like Pat
Metheny and Pat Martino. '
Cedar - W.alton steadily offered
mathematical, low-key piano. His

accompaniment was usually com- -
prised of sparse, unsustained polyto--

nal chords. .
The drumming of Peter Erskine
was the mostvelectrifying element of
the show, discounting Sonny Rollins.
Erskine’s contemporary sound is fas-

-‘stage,

 

cinating. Extremely ambidextrous,
his hands were free to do anything he
could think of, and he thought alot.

But‘ as expected, the evening
belonged to Sonny Rollins, possibly
the greatest living jazz saxophonist.
When he was unleashed onto the
the whole scene changed
immediately. Everything loosened up
as he caroused on the stage in his Zen
shirt, like a euphoric drunkard. The
stoic seriousness of the event

‘changed radically and when the rest
of the featured players jammed, his

energy was instantly contagious.
Rollins performed four standards
with rhythm section only; this was
the high point of the night. However,
therave-up on -"Don't Stop the Car-
nival," with the whole ensemble, was
genuinely exciting and animated.
From beginning to end, Rollins’
improvisations were youthful and

playful. He looked to be having fun, .

filling his solos with tongue—in-cheek
quotes from nursery rhymes, Christ-
mas carols and folk songs.

Local jazz fans got their money's
worth at this concert as they wit-

nessed some of the most lauded

artists in today's jazz operate. The
spontaneous atmosphere seemed to
have caused one problem in the ego
gratification department, however,
and the accused man is Freddie Hub-
bard. He seemed to be impatiently
waiting for his next chance to blow

his horn in a solo. But personalities

are always a danger in jam sessions
and at some points this jam session
was really cooking.

Volleyball team sees

B.E. as “package” deal  

By Laurie Kubli

""* The Pitt News

Today the Pitt women’s volleyball
team is travelling .to Providence,
R.I., for the Big East Conference
championships. Pitt is seeded first,
at 26-6, ahead of the 41-3 Friars of
Providence. This seemingly odd fact
was no less mysterious to Pitt coach
Shelton Collier.

“How they seeded a team who is
41-3, and has just beaten us here in
Pittsburgh is beyond me,” ‘Collier

,7.’ remarked. “It doesn’t really matter

.93

Wheeling
’ hockey

team’s-

next foe

H By Mary Wolf
The Pitt" News

After rejoining the West Penn

College hockey league this year, the

Pitt hockey team is having an
impressive season with a 4—l-l

‘? record. The Panthers are ‘ranked

second in their division behind 4-0

‘7 Duquesne.

The Pitt skaters see no real prob-
lems with their next opponent and
they have reason to believe they will
put Wheeling on ice in Sunday’s
home game. “There are no stand-
outs on their team and we should
beat themswith no trouble,” said
right wing Roger Oldaker. “Wheel-
ing only won one game in the past
two years and it was on a forfeit.”

—After last Friday’s game, in which

 Pitt suffered its first loss of the sea-

 

son to Gannon, the Panthers have
decided not to take any game too
lightly. “Wheeling is an average
team but sometimes those teams are
hard to beat,” said left wing Jim
Owens Jr. “No gameis an easy game
for our team. We have to go out and
give 110 percent every game.”
Team co-captain Jim Lang sees
the Wheeling game as an opportun-
ity for' Pitt to improve its playing
abilities. “Wheeling has been in the
league for the past four or five years
and they haven’t done all that well,"
said Lang. “This will give us, a
chance to play a- good, solid game

 defensively and work on our own

defense.” -
, Part of the reason for the success
of any team lies in the attitudes of its

players, and the Pitt hockey team-

does not like to go into any game
thinking it will be easy. “We can't
just show up and go through the
motions; we have to give it our all,”
said Owens.

When the Panthers step out on the
ice on Sunday they will be readv to

, play hard. “There was a lot of inten- 

sity in the locker room before the

West Virginia game and we put it ’
into our skates,” said goalie Bob"

Matioli. “If we can keep the intensity
up this time we should have no trou-
ble winning.” i

Pitt is looking forward to locking
horns with some tougher competi-
tion in the near future. Duquesne
leads the division and will be Pitt's
strongest opponent this season. The
Panthers are striving to revise their
current playing style before they
meet

December 9. “Our defense still
~, hasn’t found the right" chemistry," I
 ‘Owens. “A fewtimess in the

up with Duquesne on

the match it adds a dimension. Our
team’s always better as an underdog,
but if the committee votes us as the
No. 1 seed, then who am I to argue?”

Collier said his team has been uti-
lizing “imagery training,” based on
scouting reports and the teams’ two
previous meetings. Pitt won the first,
3-0, at the Temple Invitational, and
Providence won here later in the sea-
son by taking the best-of-five match
3-2. Senior setter Cathy Rupp thinks
that Pitt knows Providence well
enoughito win.

“We _really know Providence,”
Rupp said. “We know what tolook
for because they’ve played the same
system for two years.” The Ohio
native says that this gives the advan-
tage to Pitt because her team doesn’t
have a specific defense.

“When we’re pumped up we play
crazy defense. We don’t have a set

' defense, we just try to play crazy

defense — everybody gets the ball

when they can.” Rupp added that.

Providence will concentrate on
blocking middle blockers Ulana
Rohutiak and Sue Hoover, as well
as trying to tip tothe middle in an
effort to“ hit the weak spot in P_itt’s
perimeter defense.

“But nobody in the country can
stop Ulana,” Rupp said. ‘

Hoover, a sophomore from Rich-
land, said that the ankle she injured
two weeks ago before the Penn State
upset is “practically new.” This is her
first season as strictly a. middle

blocker, and she says it has made a

difference in her play. .

“Last year I played several posi-
tions,” Hoover stated. “This year I’ll
be able to capitalizeon playing one
position. I can concentrate on mid-
dle blocking and middle attacking. I
have more attack options,» such as
the quick- set." - »

Pitt will begin by playing No, 8
seed Boston College tomorrow at l 1,
a.m., then the winner of Vi1lanova—
Connecticut, seeded fourthand fifth
respectively, at 8 p.m. “The keys to
winning these two matches are try-
ing to dominate them and over-
power them early in the match to
establish that we came to win the
-tournament,” said Collier.

With the amount of confidence
the Pitt players and coaches have
expressed with regard to the out-
come of the tournament, .the ques-
tioniarises as to whether or not they
may fall prey to overconfidence. Pitt
was seeded first going into last sea-
son’s championships and was unde-
feated at thetournament going into
the final against Providence, where
 lost. : _ ,  i ' 

Rupp says‘ tlije Pitt team’ realizes
the importanceﬁaf Saturday's games
in a tournamentgsvith single elimina-
tion. “We eanlﬁgure allthat in the
same package?" ,,e have a realistic
view of   ‘ad of us,” Rupp
said. “We’ll  it/' one point at,a
time, one gamejtt a time.” I

The 5-8 setterﬁtiaintains that Pitt's
use of Mikasa balls in practice gives
it a further advantage. In, tourna-
merits during the season, Tachikara
balls were used; however, in the(Big
East tournament, the much heavier

Mikasa ball will be used. The spikers
have prepared all season long with
both’ types, using the heavier one in
preparation for the conference
championships. “You can hit them
(Mikasa) pretty much as hard as you
want, and they'll be hard to receive,”
Rupp said. It has forced her, as the
setter, to make an adjustment. “It
gives us an advantage physically and
psychologically.”

Collier said that there are several
‘keys to his teamffwinning thetourna-
iment. “We must serve aggressively
and serve a lot of aces. Our strength
is in our point-scoring ability as_ a

Pitt Lady Panthers basketball

“coach J udy‘Saurer took a giant step

this week toward insuring a quality
women’s basketball program in the
years to come. Saurer announced
Thursday that she has received
signed letters of intent from three
outstanding higihsschool players. Jill
Sitlinger and Amy Holman from the
Harrisburg area, along with Taba-
tha “Tabby” Long from Teaneck,
New Jersey, have agreed to play for
Pitt beginning next fall.

Saurer said that she and her staff
are “real excited” over the early signs

,.

  Saurerbuilding strong program

ing of these quality players. Saurer

faces the task of _replacing_fg/3
seniors at the end of this season,

three of whom are guards, but she

has already lowered that number to

two with" this week's signings.

All three recruitstghave the ability
to contribute immediately. Sitlinger,
currently a senior at Upper Dauphin
Area High School, is a scoring
machine who operates at the point

guard spot. Sitlinger‘ has already’

scored over 1,000 points in her high
school career, with her senior year
yet to come. As a junior, Sitlinger
averaged 24.5 points per game and
was named to the Harrisburg
Patriot News’ Big 15. She also holds
school records for career assists and
career steals. Saurer commented,

Panthers face Palmeiras

PITTSBURGH — After a
month of squaring off strictly
against itself, the Pitt basketball
squad gets its first dose of outs_ide
competition this Saturday at 8
p.m. when it hosts Palmeiras of
Brazil in an exhibition game at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Panthercoach Roy Chipman
has some definite goals going
into the contest. “We want to get
a handle, on how well we've pre-
pared this team for the season,"
commented Chipman. “We're a
little up in the air because we
don’t know how the kids are
going to react in a real game. I’m
not concerned about winning.‘ I
just want to get eight of nine
players ready fo: our opener.”

“Sheis a good penetrating guard
with great scoring ability. She is an
explosive “player.”

Much of the same characteristics
can be found in Holman. She, like
Sitlinger, is a point guard and was
named to the Big"l5 last year. Hol-
man averaged 17 points per game as
a junior at Middletown Area High
School. She shot 54 percent from the
field and also pulled down 13
rebounds per game. “She’s all Amer- I
ican, apple pie," said Saurer. “She
has all kinds of ability. She can
shoot from the outside. She's got
great range." —

Saurer ventured into New Jersey
to sign Long. Long is a center-
forward who averaged over 13
points per game last year and
gathered 14.7 rebounds per game.
She was named'All-County and All-
Northern New Jersey as a junior at
Teaneck High School. Saurer noted, ,
“She is some leaper. She is aggres-
sive and there is no question that she
can sky.“ ‘

All three players will be welcome
additions to Saurer’s squad next
year. “They’are all excellent stu-
dents,". said Saurer. “We got some
outstanding people when we signed
these kids.”

‘ The skaters are optimistic and are
ready for a challenging battle with
Duquesne. “I can’t wait to play that

“They're the big shots in the league
but I think we're better.”

The injury occurred to the young

CHICAGO (UPl)—Michael
Jordan scored a career high 46

San Antonio, which was the

noted that Pat Belcher’s absence and
Kohutiak‘s injury-weakened per-
formance in the Providence match
contributed largely to that loss, and
both players will be healthy for the
weekend’s play. ‘

“We definitely have the advantage
at the setting position," Collier said,
“which is similar to the quarterback
in football. Cathy is by far the best in
the conference.” The coach said that
the fourth key to his team’s success
lies in its mental and strategic prepa-
ration, and the fifth in his
sophomores.

_ “I’ve coached Kris Wexell and
Sue Hoover for five years now —
