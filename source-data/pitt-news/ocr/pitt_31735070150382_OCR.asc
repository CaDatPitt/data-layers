STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGB hopes for smooth
transition to next Board

Megan Trimble
S taff W riter

As the 2012 Student Government
Board nears the end of its term,
one ﬁnal task remains —— a suc-
cessful transition.

The current members will
hand over their work and duties
in January to the newly elected
2013 Board. The Student Gov-
ernment Board — responsible
for distributing funds from the

more than $2 million Student "

Activities Fund — is working to

. accomplish a smooth transition

that will not hinder efﬁcient and
effective decision—making and
progress for the incoming Board.

Board President James Lan-
dreneau said that he has set
a Dec. 1 deadline for himself,
Board members and committee
chairs to produce a handbook of

project information, advice and B

concerns to be shared with the
incoming Board.

Landreneau said the cur-
rent Board will use the month
of December to discuss transi-
tion documents and provide the
newly elected members an Al-
locations process crash course._
These efforts will be done to

V prevent a time-consuming learn-

ing curve for incoming members
and to create a formal transition
_process, which he said former
Boards have overlooked. ‘

“What alarms me is I don’t
know if any Board has ever had
a formal transition period,” Lan-
dreneau said. “And personally, I
think that’s ridiculous because
there are things to talk about,
and there are a lot of things that
SGB is criticized for that could be
alleviated by talking to the next

 

year’s Board.”

At Tuesday’s public meeting,
Landreneau said that the infor-
mation will be shared this week-
end during transition meetings,
which will include current com-
mittee chairs determining the
2013‘committees with the Board
and conversations between the
incoming and outgoing Boards
to discuss successes and failures.

Landreneau said that his

transition from Board member “

to president included confusion
over Robert’s Rules — the rules
by which public meetings are
conducted ——- which, he said,
“took me a while to learn on my
own.”

Board transitions include
transferring. projects that are in
progress from the current Board
to incoming members. Landre-
neau said that this handoff will
be important during the change
of responsibilities.

Although SGB candidates
run on initiatives,'or proposed
projects that they believe are
feasible, these often remain in-

complete after the members’-

year-long terms and must be

‘taken up by the following Board.

Board member Julie Hallinan
helped to develop several proj-
ects during her tenure on the
Board that must transition to the
incoming Board for completion.
Chief among them is the Colle-
giate Readership Program, a pro-
gram that provides‘ copies of The
New York Times and USA Today
to undergraduate non-College of
General Studies students.

Heinz Chapel Choir opens holiday season

Pittsburgh residents Linda Jack-
son and JoAnn Bralich have been
attending the Heinz Chapel Choir
Holiday Concert for 15 years.

“We all feel that we can start
our Christmas season once we’ve
heard this concert,” Bralich said
following the choir’s ﬁnal song,
“Deck the Halls.”

The choir, composed of some "

of Pitt’s most gifted singers, puts
on a holiday—themed concert every

V year in Heinz Chapel to provide

students and locals with an enjoy-
able event to celebrate the upcom-

' ing holiday season. .

This year, the 74-year-old stu-
dent choir will perform ﬁve con-
certs sprinkled throughout ‘early
December, and the ﬁrst one took

place Thursday evening.

“It’s a popular concert and sets
the mood for the entire holiday
season,” said Steven Anisko, the
choir’s organist. “For many peo-
ple, it’s been a long tradition of
coming here.” V

Led by Director John Gold-

smith, the choir performed songs .

such as “O Come, 0 Come Em-
manuel” and “Ubi Caritas” for the
audience of all ages packed into
Heinz Chapel. The choir, which
puts on different renditions of
classic holiday songs at the event,
displayed their vocals in multiple
languages, including Latin and
Ukrainian. Most of the choir’s
songs were sung a cappella-, which
means they had no piano or organ
to accompany them.

In a month that makes spirits
bright through song, the choir
sang some other holiday classics,

including “O Come, All Ye Faith- ,

ful” and “Silent Night,” while the
audience and organist chimed in,
as well, following lyrics printed in
brochures.

The holiday concerts usually
draw a large audience — a testa-
ment to the appeal of the holiday
musical traditions the choir pro-
vides.

“What a way to start off the
Christmas season,” Jackson said.
“The talent and the passion — and
they’re not even music majors.”

The choir spends months pre-
paring for the annual holiday con-
cert, which will also be broadcast
live on WQED-TV on Dec. 7 at 8
p.m.

According to Ryan'Hestin, a ju- t

nior computer science major and
bass singer in the choir, the group

for the incoming Board in early Novem-
ber, but the new members will have to de-
cide its fate for future funding at the con-
clusion of the contract in April.

Hallinan said that, while the future of
the program might be in ﬂux, she is not
concerned that ground will be lost during
the transition.

“I know [incoming President Gor-
don Louderback] is interested in ﬁnding
alternative funding for the Readership

[Program], so I’m conﬁdent that the pro—-

gram won’t lose momentum,” she said,
although she intends to‘ stay involved
with the Readership Program and other
projects she has worked on after her term
ends.

Hallinan plans to suggest that the new
Board should select a student to act as the
program’s coordinator, so that someone
outside of the Board can dedicate time
to programming and activities related to
The New York Times and USA Today part-
nership.  .

Charlie Shull, a 2009 Board member

and 2010 president, and Molly Stieber, a
2010 Board member and 2011 president,
both said incoming Boards must focus
on pushing productivity and maintaining
professional relationships if they want to
carry over projects and responsibilities
successfully. ' -

Shull said that the spring semester is a

' crucial time for pushing productivity.

This, he said, means that.Board ex-
citement and motivation at the start of
the term must be harnessed. After they
assume their positions, Board members
must work to establish contacts and at-
tempt to fulﬁll as many campaign prom-
ises as possible before summer break. The
president, Shull explained, must monitor
this effort and progress.

“It is the president’s responsibility to
make use of that [momentum], and have
fun but also hold his Board members ac-
countable,” he said.

Stieber said that the transition from
president to president is strengthened
when a professional relationship exists.

“Obviously, I was good friends with _'

[Landreneau] and had a great professional

relationship with those that I transitioned . .
, with, and a solid professional relationship

is always a good thing,” Stieber said.
Stieber said that having the current
Board and incoming Board meet behind
closed doors helps to tackle any questions
that new members have and prepare them
for their ﬁrst public meeting onjan. 8.
The newly elected members will as-
sume their positions in January at the
start of the spring semester and fulﬁll
them through the fall semester of the
2013 academic year. Stieber said while the
mid—year transition might be unorthodox
compared to other schools’ student gov-

, ernments, it is beneﬁcial for the passing

of Board leadership. .
In many cases, Stieber explained, the

outgoing president and Board members

continue their schooling at Pitt or remain
in the area after their term ends. This,
she said, provides an accessible and valu-
able resource if the incoming president or
members needassistance.

“In our transition, [Landreneau] knew
what he was doing, but he could text me
or call me and I was right there if he had a
question,” she said.

President-elect and current Board
member Gordon Louderback said he is
looking forward to a comprehensive tran-

sitioning process, since the current Board
didn’t have one coming into its term.

“It” is something [Landreneau] is mak-
ing his biggest priority, and he is really
working to set us all_ up to be successful,”
Louderback said. “The relationship we
have makes it easy to work together and
makes it comfortable for him to leave ev-
erything over to me and for me to assume
the responsibilities.” 1

Incoming Board member David Rosen-
thal, who doesn’t have experience on the
Board, said he’s looking forward to the
transition meetings and feels that they
will give the incoming members a “good
chance to see what needs to happen mov-
ing forward.”

Rosenthal said he’s interested in
speaking with the outgoing committee
chairs and the Transportation and Safety
Committee in particular, which he will be
working with in the future to accomplish
one of his initiatives —- setting up a pro-
gram to get students more transportation
to the airports when they leave for breaks.
He said that discussions with the outgo-

rehearses every Tuesday and Thursday eve-
ning up until the concerts.

“I like the music we make,” Hestin said.
“There are a lot of great singersfin this choir
— really great talent — and it is a lot of fun
to be able to sing alongside them.”

While the concert included some livelier,
nostalgic songs, the choir was also able to
‘create a silent atmosphere for a few short
moments. At one point, the 52—member
choir walked along the outer edges of the
audience, each member holding a candle in
hand, while Goldsmith, the director, walked
right down the center aisle. '

ing Board members will help_ to alert the
new members of any institutional or proj-
ect issues that the former members met
over their past term.

Board member Zoe Samudzi said it’s
important to include, contact informa-
tion for University committee members in
the transition documents, because Board
members do not always work directly with
speciﬁc deans or heads of departments.

Samudzi said that supplying incoming
Board members with speciﬁc contact in-
formation will save them the “trouble of
running around” to determine the proper
people to discuss initiatives with, but all
members must also learn SGB processes

~—— such as Allocations — by trial and er—_

ror. . .
“It will be necessary for the new mem-
bers to learn some things on their own,
because while they know how" the [Alloca-
tions] process works, they also need to get
familiar with the Allocations committee of
their Board and of their time,” she said.

Rosenthal said that he believes the in-
coming Board will meet with future suc-
cess. ' ‘ ,

“I am very conﬁdent,” Rosenthal said.
“I knew all of the [newly elected] Board
members prior to the election and am con-
ﬁdent that we will be able to do a good job.”

_ ' Creating a different sound than the vo-
cals that dominated most of the concert,
Anisko also played a few pieces alone. Ani-
sko, a Pitt alumni and former bass singer
in the choir, has been involved in the Heinz
Chapel Choir since 1993.

Anisko studied music at Pitt and per-
formed in the choir for three years. He
toured around Greece and Italy with the
choir, as well — a trip that he really enjoyed.
He remembers singing in the middle of the
town square in Venice, Italy, and in a cathe-
dral in Siena, Italy.

One of Anisko’s professors while at Pitt,
Robert Lord, was the organist for 44 years.
Anisko soon followed in his footsteps and
has been the organist since 1999.

But now, Anisko primarily plays in the

holiday concerts. He prepares for these
concerts by practicing in the off—hours of
the chapel — when he can get the gigan-
tic space to himself. Anisko also said that
as a former choir member, he thinks that
most students really enjoy being a part of
this group.

“It’s a wonderful extra—curricular ac-
tivity. It’s a great creative outlet from the
regular things, and there is good camara-
derie between choir members; good spirits
between them,” Anisko said.

Hestin could not agree more.

“The choir is absolutely fantastic,” Hes-
tin said, who is now singing in the choir for
his ﬁfth year. “It is a great activity through
the school, and it relieves stress, especially
during ﬁnals,” Hestin said. I

POINT OF CLAIRE-ITY

 

S

Suprisingly, reckless manslaughter not
the best topic for Christmas songs

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

Whether it’s a traditional carol V

or a popular favorite from a mov-
ie, from now until 2013, we’ll all
be singing some sort of holiday

tune. As a means‘ of inﬁltrating '

our lives even more, just about
every single store in the country

is playing these songs with the"

“repeat all” setting selected.

' Some Christmas carols are
secular, and others are not.
There has to be one song that
just makes you happy, taking you
back to those blustery days of
building snowmen in the yard
or the delicious holiday meals
shared at grandpa’s.

But there,are some songs that
are just inexcusably bad. They
deserve to be removed from the
mall’s holiday playlist.

Take, for instance, the classic
“We Wish You —a Merry Christ-
mas.” It’s the epitome of repeti-_

tion. Just hum the theme. Just

say thewords. ,
Also, the message: Carolers
have appeared" at your door,
seemingly out of Christmas’ spir-
it. But alas, they now demand
figgy pudding.
First of all, I have no .idea
what is in figgy pudding. Sec-
ond of all, after consulting Food

Network, I have none of the nec- '

essary ingredients to create this
odd substance. So if you really
“won’t go until we get some,”
you’ll have to wait for me to
drive to the store, buy the ingre-
dients and then sit for another

hour and a half, as dictated by
the estimatedcooking time.

So much for holiday spirit!
Can’t you just wish me “merry
Christmas” and “happy New
Year’s” without expecting some-
thing in return from me? This is
impolite,.at best. _

Let’s try to think of a lovely
dinner with grandparents. Cue
“Over the River and Through
the Woods.” We’re traveling in
a horse-drawn sleigh through a
snowy forest. Aren’t there any
roads that lead to grandma’s?
As picturesque as this method
is, thewind is stinging —— are we
actively trying to acquire frost-
bite here? I prefer the heated
seats of my father’s SUV, thanks.

Instead of this treacherous
route‘ to grandma’s, maybe it’s
just easier for you to host dinner
on Christmas Eve. Everything
goes well, until something hap-
pens that only you and grandpa
witness. “Grandma Got Run
Over by a Reindeer.”

This is such a violent and sad —

Christmas song. Grandma meets
an untimely death after drinking
too much eggnog and stumbling

into the snow for her medica-
tion, which I’m sure. wouldn’t

have mixed well, anyway. Her
forehead marked with hoof
prints, the family’s only concern

iswhether or not to send back _

grandma’s unopened presents.
. We’ve officially moved into

irreverent territory. The com-

bination of a brutal involuntary

manslaughter and a lack of re-

spect for the departed is one that

should never be associated with
this season. '

Personally, I would prefer
getting run over by a reindeer to
hearing the dreaded synthesizer
intro toe“Wonderful Christmas-
time.” Rather than sugarplums,
visions of bad ’80s attire and
cheap visual effects are the only
things dancing in my head. just
watch the music video. Nothing
says the holidays like-morph-
ing constellations and ﬂoating
torsos dressed as angels, right?

All I want for Christmas is
never to hear that song again.
Speaking of, why would anyone

write an entire song about his or A

her dream of receiving two front
teeth for Christmas? Why are
those front teeth so coveted? For
tongue twisters and whistling,
apparently.

. Let me tell you something.
Nobody likes tongue twisters,
anyway. Whistling isn’t all that
it’s cracked up to be: I can barely
whistle and my two front teeth
areintact. My life is unchanged.

Other useless Christmas

_wishes include hippopotami.
“I Want a Hippopotamus for
Christmas?” Why on earth would
you? They are unattractive crea-

' tures. I can only assume that,
with all of the Christmas fes-
tivities, the hippo would feel
threatened, and that’s where the
danger starts. The hippo is con-
sidered Africa’s most dangerous
creature, killing nearly three
thousand‘ humans annually.

. But the ﬁnal straw for me is
the wretched “chingedy—ching”
associated with “Dominick the
Donkey.” The song tells the story
of a donkey who, with better
agility than that of a reindeer,
can deliver Christmas presents
through the hills of Italy. At first
it’s precious: a much less noble
creature ﬁlling in for the ever—
popular reindeer.

Then the chorus comes in. C

The words “hee—haw,” as in
Dominick’s braying, litter the
tune with noise reminiscent of
the barnyard. Though the song’
barely lasts’ three minutes, the
cringe—worthy “hee~haw” will

haunt you for hours afterward,

rendering this song the absolute
worst of the bunch.

Before you continue to click
through your own playlists of
Christmas songs, consider what
you’re listening to first. Is‘ it
about an animal? Is it evoking

an awful mental image? Think ‘

again. Hopefully these sad ex-
cuses for holiday music haven’t
become stuck in your head. I

LETTERS To THE EDITOR

\

To the Editor:

"The article and editorial from Nov. 19 on the “ri ” in the Honors
College (UHC) portray a ﬁght between incompatible ideologies, but it’s
really a resistance to changes in the UHC that bring it in line with today’s
expectations of college graduates. First, I don’t understand the insistence
that “intellectual curiosity” should be the only goal of the UHC, nor that
it’s incompatible with achievement—based goals. Breadth of knowledge is

great, but most students reach a point when they want to pursue one subject.

more deeply. Why shouldn’t the UHC help them succeed in. their ﬁeld‘?
The reading groups embody the old UHC; niche groupsthat attracted
few students and were purely for ﬁm. These are the makings of a club,
not a college. Now the UHC is expanding programs that appeal to more
students and help ﬁirther their careers. The addition of apre-med adviser
raised particular ire — but a large portion of Pitt students are pre-med,
and many are high—achi'eving; the UHC is merely responding to demand.
. ‘The UHC should retain a commitment to intellectual curiosity, but I

applaud its increasing emphasis on programs that will help me bui1d,a;‘

better resume and reach the level where I can make an impact in my ﬁeld.
I have participated in several honors programs, but the most valuable have
been the Brackenridge Research Fellowship and scholarship advising,
both focused on achievement. ' V
Lastly, for those who care about the UHC and want to express their

opinions, please get off Facebook and try starting a respectful dialogue

with the administration.

To the Editor,

I. I’m concerned that Parthena Moisiadis’ article “Best-selling

author comes to campus” addressed little of the controversy sur-
rounding Tucker Max’s visit. The Campus Women’s Organization
and other protesting students mainly took issue with the fact that
Max, who has a history of having dubiously consensual sexual

' intercourse with§”"W.omen, received funds from Pitt. When CWO
‘originally expressed concern over his visit, we were told that he

had reformed in early 2012, and was now seeking a change in his
life. However, when a member of the protest explained to Max after
the event on Monday why we were protesting, he told her‘ that he
had never disavowed his previous lifestyle and infact never would.

 V The fact that money from the Student Activities Fund went in the

‘form of thousands of dollars to a man who has inot only admitted
to borderline illegal sexual activitiesvbut does not, in fact, repent
them or his misogyn-istic writing and rap,e.jokes_i's an incredible

Several Pitt sportsteams ready for crucial Weekend matchups

Four Pitt teams —.wrest|ing, women’s basketball, foothaii and men’s hasketbail — are set to play this weekend all over the East Coast. Pitt News File Photos

The Pitt wrestling team will face a ranked team
in its home opener. The football team will try
to become bowl eligible. The men’s basketball
team will host a talented mid—major foe. And
the women’s basketball head coach will attempt
to tie the school’s a1l—time wins record. .

With four of Pitt’s biggest sports teams all in
action in the next few days, it might be hard to
keep up with the respective groups of Panthers
as they prepare for crucial matchups.

Here’s your guide to a busy weekend in Pitt
sports.

Friday, Nov. 30: Wrestlingvs. Virginia Tech,
Fitzgerald Field House, 7 p.m.

The Pitt wrestling team isn’t happy with
how its season has started.

After losing on the road to No. 14 Michigan
and No. 5 Ohio State, the No. 18 Panthers (0-2)
will face another ranked team when they wel-
come No. 11 Virginia Tech (3-1) to the Fitzgerald
Field House Friday at 7 p.m.

Pitt has never lost to the Hokies in wrestling,

winning all nine matchups against the ACC
schoo1.VBut that could change Friday.

Virginia Tech enters the dual on a three-
match winning streak and with ﬁve wrestlers
ranked in the top 10 nationally.

If the Panthers want to beat the talented
Hokies, they must avoid another slow start.
Pitt fell behind 12-3 against Michigan and 26-3
against Ohio State before seeing late comeback
attempts fail in each match.

Because four of Pitt’s ﬁve ranked wrestlers
compete at 165 pounds or more, and all ﬁve
ranked Hokies wrestle at or below that weight,

falling behind might be ‘inevitable for Pitt.

But if No. 7 Shelton Mack can earn an early
victoryforthe Panthers at 133 pounds and Pittig.
No. 11 Tyler Wilps can upset N o. 4 Pete Yates at
the crucial 165—pound weight class, the home
team should earn its ﬁrst victory of the_season.

Saturday, Dec. 1: Women’s basketball at
Lafayette, 2 p.m.; Men’s basketball versus
Detroit, Petersen Events Center, 7 
Football at South Florida, 7 p.m.

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Louisville stuns Rutgers to
earn conference’s BCS bid

Dustin Gabler
g Senior Stajj” Wrz'ter

With last night’s championship—deciding meet-
ingbetween future BigTen-school Rutgers and
future ACC-school Louisville in the rearview
mirror, the Big East looks ahead to avery bleak
future. _

The conference has almost been completely
dismantled. The Big East has just one original
football member left — Temple —— and only
three schools remain from the expansion in
2004 — Cincinnati, Connecticut and South
Florida. All of those schools are rumored to
be actively seekingways out of the conference.

It’s been a long time coming, but this week-
endwillbe the last time theBigEast Conference
football season as we know it takes the ﬁeld.
The conference’s biggest game of the season
was settled on Thursday night — ﬁtting for
the Big East — and only two games remain. ‘

Here are my ﬁnal Big East rankings:

1. Louisville

In typical Big East fashion, the Cardinals
(10—2, 5-2 Big East) came from behind to shock

Rutgers, 20-17, on Thursday night in_the de
facto Big East championship game.

After fallingbehind 14-7, Louisville stormed
back — thanks to a gutsy performance from
injured quarterback Teddy Bridgewater ——
with two quick touchdowns in the third quarter
and late ﬁeld goal to seal the win.

With the victory, Louisville clinches a share
of the Big East title, and the Cardinals will al-
most definitely receive the conference’s BCS

[berth as a result of being the highest-ranked

team in the BCS standings.

2. Rutgers

It was a heartbreaking end to the season
forthe Scarlet Knights (9-3, 5-2 Big East), who
lost their ﬁnal two conference games, missing
out on what would’ve been the program’s first
BCS bowl game. ‘ g -

Like it did in its loss to Pitt last week, Rut-
gers’ offense struggled to consistently move
the ball against‘Louisville, especially in the
second half.

A 9-3 season and a share of the conference

27 for 176 yards and scored a touchdown for
the Bearcats (8-3, ‘4-2 Big East) in their 27-10
victory overSouth Florida. The senior second-

‘ stringer received plenty of help from his rush-

ing attack. Running back George Winn played
an important role in Cincinnati’s offense with
119 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries.
The Bearcats head on the road to take on
Connecticut in a matchup of two schools vy-
ing hard to leave the Big East. The Huskies are
one win from bowl eligibility, so Cincinnati
will have to play well to earn its ninth victory’
and clinch a share of its fourth Big East title
inﬁve years. I

4. Syracuse

Temple pounced on Syracuse early, going
up .1o—o, but the Orange (7-5, 5-2 Big East)
came back to win decisively 38-20 in their
ﬁnal Big East game. a

Head coach Doug Marrone’s team scored

' through the air most of the year but took to

the ground in its ﬁnal game. With a rushing
attack featuring three backs who recorded
more than 50 yards, Syracuse cruised to 260
rushing yards on the ground on 49 attempts.

For a team that started 1-3 with its only win
against an FCS school, Syracuse has come a
long way to grab a share of the Big East. title
in its last year in the conference.

5. Connecticut  I ' ’ ;, -
Needing three straight wins for bowl eligi-
bility, the Huskies (5-6, 2-4 Big East) have won

’ their ﬁrst two and will be looking for the third
. V against Cincinnati on Saturday. UConn will

be conﬁdent after stunning No. 20 Louisville

23-20 in triple overtime last week, proving

anything can happen in the Big East.
Connecticut has looked poor offensively

;e all season, and that hasn’t changed in either
;_ ‘of its past two wins. Against Louisville, the

Huskies were outgainedby 160 yards, and
quarterback Chandler Whitmer was terrible,

     
 

on Senior Day. With dominating victories over
two ranked teams this season and a triple‘-
overtime loss to No. 1 Notre Dame, Pitt will
wonder how it has lost six games.

The Jekyll-and-Hyde Panthers will hope
that their good side shows up in the regular
season ﬁnale against South Florida this Sat-
urday. Pitt needs awin to play in abowl game.

7. Temple .

What started out so well for the Owls (4-7,
2-5 Big East) ended very badly.

When Temple was 2-0 in Big East play, it
appeared as though the one-year—removed
MAC team was going to shock the Big East.
That didn’t happen. The Owls ended up drop-
ping their last ﬁve conference games, getting

outscored in those games by a wide 199-74
margin. I

Luckily for the Owls, four of the ﬁve teams
thatcrushed them will be off to new confer-
ences in the near future, as Pitt, Syracuse, Lou-

isville and Rutgers have reached agreements A

to leave the Big East.-

8. South Florida I 5 '
In such a crucial time for every Big East

team looking for a new conference home, the ~ 1

Bulls (3-8, 1-5 Big East) are performing terri-
bly on the ﬁeld. Last week’s loss to Cincinnati

' leaves South Florida as the only Big East team

stuck with just one conference win, and it will
be looking to take that out on Pitt Saturday.
But the Bulls have been owned by the Pan-
thers. Since joining the conference in 2004,
South Florida has beaten Pitt only twice in
seven meetings. 4 -
Defeating a future ACC school could go a
long way for the Bulls as they tryto look appeal-
ing to other conferences. And the players won’t
just be playing for a future conference home.
On Senior Day, they may be playing for their
-c_oach’s job; another loss will put head coach
Skip Holtz ﬁrmly in the hot seat 3

Pitt women’s basketball head coach Agnus

[Berenato has an opportunity to tie the school’s

all-time coaching record forwins this Saturday
afternoon.

If her Panthers (5-1) can stretch their win-
ning streak to six and pick up their ﬁrst road
victory of the season, Coach Berenato will break

even with former head coach Kirk Bruce for
the school record. '

Pitt’s leading scorer, junior forward Asia
Logan, believes the Panthers will prepare for
the game against the Leopards (2-5) just like
any other. _

“We are really focused right now on each

November 80, 2012 i The Pitt News i wx/\/vv.pittrievve.com

and every game,” Logan said. “We’re focused
on what each team does and getting the job
’ done against them.”

Later in the day, the men’s basketball team
and football team will play at the same time.

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon’s Panthers (6-
1) face one of their toughest nonconference
matchups, as the Detroit Titans (2-3) come to
the Petersen Events Center.

Detroit, the defending Horizon League
champions, accomplished something Pitt
didn’t last season — qualifying for the NCAA’
tournament. ' '

Coming off a 70 -46 triumph over Howard»
on Tuesday night, Dixon believes his team still
has a lot of room to improve, especially with
its rebounding. V

games in a row. It’s something that should be
a strength of ours but isn’t right now,” Dixon
said after the Howard game. “We spent two
days addressing it, but it isn’t getting done.
It’s disappointing.”

Meanwhile, the Pitt football team will look
to become bowl eligible by earning its sixth
victory of the season when the Panthers (5-6,

_ 2-4 Big East) face South Florida at Raymond

James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. The game will
be televised on ESPN2.

After demolishing N o. 18 Rutgers last week,
Pitt should be conﬁdent that it can defeat the
struggling Bulls (3-8, 1-5 Big "East) to book a
likely trip to either the Pinstripe Bowl in New
York or the Beef ‘O’ Brady’s Bowl in St. Peters-
burg, Fla. - _

At his weekly press conference, head coach

Paul Chryst stated that playing in a bowl game
is a huge incentive for the Panthers to win their
regular—season ﬁnale.

“I love any time we get a chance to play more
football. We’ve got to go earn it, and I like that
part of it,” Coach Chryst said. “When you go to
abowl, you’ve done enough to earn the right to
play another game and a chance to be around
some of these  for one more game.”

Chryst also hopes that Pitt’s seniors, who
performed so well on Senior Day against Rut-
gers, will rise to the occasion yet‘ again.

“You’d hope they go in to every game kind
of on that emotional edge,” he said of his se-
niors. “I think it’s great that we’re playing for
something very signiﬁcant. Emotion carries
you so far, but then you have to play well and

you’ve got to focus on that.” I
