Former v
Congressman
visits campus

Aaron Stier—Cohen
Stayj‘ Wrz'ter

A prospective candidate for the U.S. Senate
visited Pitt to answer questions from students
about issues prevalent in both Pennsylvania
and the nation.

Three—star Navy Adm. Joe Sestak met
with the Pitt Law Democrats on Tuesday to
lay groundwork for his 2016 campaign for a
seat in the Senate. 4

Sestak, 62, the highest-ranking military

‘ ofﬁcial ever elected to Congress, represented

Pennsylvania’s 7th congressional district from
2007 to 2011. He currently teaches political
science courses part-time at both- Carnegie
Mellon University and Cheyney University.
In 2010, Sestak ran a highly publicized
campaign against the Democratic establish-
ment candidate Arlen Specter. Sestak won
the primary, but lost in the general election.
When asked about his mistakes in that elec
tion, Sestak blamed himself. '
“I wasn’t smart enough. I wasn’t good
enough,” Sestak said. “I was accountable.”
But now, after serving four years in Con-
gress, Sestak has more experience.
Duringthe hour-longtalk in the Barco Law
Building, he recalled being on Capitol Hill dur-

ingthebeginningoftherecession.According‘ E

to Sestak, some Democrats were afraid of tak-
ing action for fear of public blame.

“Where is the accountability?” Sestak
asked. “People need to trust that [their lead-

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Board provides

midterm
updates

Abbey Reighard
Staff Wrz'ter

Student Government Board members up-
dated the president on their initiatives, rang-
ing from greener lifestyles to improving the
quality of food served on campus.

Board President Mike N ites reported that
he spent Monday and Tuesday conducting
one-on—one meetings with each Board mem-
ber to discuss success of their projects to an
audience of about 15 people at the Board’s
weekly public meeting atNordy’s Place in the
William Pitt Union on Tuesday night.

Nites said Gordon Louderback, last year’s
Board president, introduced project check-
points through which Board members gave
weekly updates of their project progress at
public Board meetings. _

Nites said his one-on—one meetings take
Louderback’s weekly checkpoints, which the
current Board still reports at SGB meetings
every week, “one stepfurther” because Nites
can address any individual challenges Board
members might be facingwith their projects.

“The Board members have my full at-
tention,” Nites said. “It’s an opportunity for
me to check where they are all at with their
projects.”

Graduates pursue foreign

ForTeresa Qiu, the exploratory nature of col-
lege didn’t end upon graduation.

Qiu, who graduated last spring, decided
that U.S. terrain wouldn’t be the site for her
ﬁrst post—graduationjob.

For various reasons, some Pitt graduates
opt to set sail across oceans to pursue careers
or further their education in other countries.
Some students also utilize Pitt’s Career De-
velopment and Placement services to ﬁnd
internships and job placements abroad. '

According to Cheryl Finlay, director of
Pitt’s Career Development and Placement
services, Career Development offers intema-
tional career—placement assistance through
the online passport career tool, which pro-
vides guidance and internship- and job—search
strategies for more than 75 countries.

But some graduates, like Qiu, pursued
overseas opportunities on their own.

Qiu teaches English abroad in Ho Chi Minh
City atvietnam USA Society, acenter designed
to teach English as aforeign language to Viet-
namese students. P

While Qiu originally planned to teach
through Council on International Educational
Exchange, a program that would help her get
a teaching position in Vietnam, she found a
job independently at Vietnam USA Society
after receiving a Teaching English as a For-
eign Language Certiﬁcate from CIEE. With the
certiﬁcate, Qiu can teach English as a second
language around the world. V

Qiu made the decision to teach abroad
after considering several post-graduation
options.

“I decided to go abroad to teach after un- ,

dergrad because I don’t really know what I
want to do as a career for the rest of my life,”
Qiu said in an email.

While she enjoyed the ﬁeld of rnicrobiol—
ogy, Qiu wanted to jointhe workforce abroad
rather than continue to study.

“I applied to a lot of nonproﬁt jobs in
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, butI don’t have
the right theoretical background,” Qiu said.
“Teaching abroad is a way of buying myself
a year to ﬁgure these things out while also
getting the chance to explore a part of the
world I haven’t been before.”

Qiu said she hopes teaching abroad will

helpher grow as a person, experience new V
things and develop ﬁilﬁlling relationships
with people from diverse backgrounds.

For other Pitt graduates, going abroad
provides a quicker segue into professional
development. ‘ i _

Jason Fang, a 2012 Pitt graduate with a.

degree in biology, enrolled this semester; in '

medical school at St. ‘George’s University in
Grenada, West Indies. ‘ I . 1  . ,1". F
Fang was frustrated with the .year-long ‘
application process for medical.’scho.o  v_ lj yl
experienced trouble gaining acceptance from
U.S. schools in which he’d been interested.
“I would rather get started on my career
than risk waiting on U.S. school decisions,”
Fang said in an email. “Apart from the prac-
tical decisions, I had always wanted to study
abroad inundergrad, but neverhadachance.
So I decided to kill two birds with one stone.”
Fang also appreciated the chance to _meet
an array of international students. Fang said
primarily American students attend St.
George’s School of Medicine, which has a
majority of students from U.S. schools ac-
cording to its website, but the school also
draws students from around the world.

 

work, study

“I feel studying internationally has really
helped me gain some perspective,” he said. “I
personally know of Syrians, South Africans,
Brits, Canadians and Trinidadians, but there
are others from other parts of the world like.
Australia and Eastern Europe.”

The experience has given Fang a broader
perspective on his own views.

“Interacting with all these cultures is a
constant reminder thatI am apart of a bigger
global community and that things that seem

' . obvious to me might not be to others, and vice

versa,” Fang said.

Both Qiu and Fang see their time abroad
as something temporary. Qiu plans to spend
ayear or two teaching in Vietnam and then
return to the United States, while Fang plans
to ﬁnish medical school, spend some time
with the local community abroad and then
ﬁnd a residency in the United States.

tional paths couldtumto Pitt’s Office of Career

Mona Kazour

Board member Mona Kazour has intro-
duced two environmental initiatives that the
Board has supported in the last month. The
initiatives included BYO(Bag), a program
which will decrease the amount of plastic
bags used on campus, and the Real Food
Challenge, which will increase the amount
of healthy, environmentally friendly food
on campus.

Kazour said she has also been revising the
Student Guide to Sustainability, a handbook

the new program within Pittserves, an of-
ﬁce under Student Aifair’s jurisdiction that
helps to connect students and student groups
with service projects, which Kazour helped

.NobleHours, which is available on the
PittServes website, is a database through
which students and student groups can re-

ers] are willing to go down, with the ship to_

do what’s righ .”

_ Pitt Law Democrats campaign liaison Dan-
iel McArdle Booker said hewas impressed by
how Sestak owned his 2010 loss. '

“I worked in politics for a whﬂe, and the
ones that lose are the ones that blame outside
forces,” Booker said. “It’s good to see him
taking responsibility.”

Abouttwenty studentsattendedthetalk, ‘ ‘

and Sestak answered questions on issues such
as drug sentencing reform, sexual assault in
the military and natural gas.

Regarding drilling for natural gas, Sestak
said the state government should close the
Halliburton loophole, which exempts hy-
draulic fracturing from regulation under the

Energy Policy Act of 2005, and start taxing -

the natural gas proﬁts.

“I’m asupporter of drillingwith the proper
oversi t,” Sestak said. “We are the only state
that doesn’ttax it.” '

Sestak said it was important to bring gas
companies to Pennsylvania but pointed out
that many of the jobs such companies create
are temporary.

“It’s not about jobs,” Sestak said. “It’s about
quality jobs.” ,

Sestak reﬂected on his military experience
when discussing sentencing reforms, focusing
on incarceratedveterans and recidivism rates.

“Forty-seven percent ofveterans are incar-

‘ cerated for drug- or alcohol-related crime,”

Sestak said.

According to the Drug Policy Alliance, ‘

veterans often turn to drugs to combat post-

. traumatic stress disorder.

Sestak also said there was a 92 percent
increase in women’s incarceration and that
the best way to ﬁght the rates of habitual re-
lapse into crime is extending postsecondary
education.

Accordingto Corrections Connection Net-
work News, adrop inhigh school graduation
rates among young women leads to poverty,
which is linked to criminal activities. The drop
in graduation rates has propelled the increase
in women’s incarceration. . '

In response to a 'student’s question on
sexual assault in the military, Sestak said he
opposes taking prosecution outside of mili-
tary courts. According to Sestak, the military
operates by resolving issues without external
involvement. He pointed to Congress as an

. institution that involves others to take care

of its problems.

“[Congress] outsources accountability,”
Sestak said. “The military is pretty darn de-
cent at accountability.”

Sestak said military officials responsible
for letting rape go unpunished should be re-
lieved of command. Years ago, the military
faced similar internal problems with race and
moved past them, according to Sestak.

Pitt Law President Ian Everhart said he
was glad Sestak could dropby betweenaradio
interview and ﬁmdraising events.  .

“He’s up and down all over. the state,”
Everhart said.

tak’s enthusiasm. -

Kazour said she has contacted members
of the Neuroscience Club about getting a self-
service printer installed in either Langley Hall
or Clapp Hall. She spoke to Vice Provost and
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey about the
printer project and expects a decision about
the printer’s location to occur by the end of
the semester.

. Abby Zurschmit

Board member Abby Zurschmit said she
has been working on an initiative to make the
William Pitt Union more student-friendly,
speciﬁcally when it comes to dining.

Zurschmit offered a dining survey to
students on the Student Government Board
website to evaluate how often students eat on
campus and to what degree campus dining
options meet students’ expectations. C

Zurschmit hopes to use the survey results,
along with the information collected from
other ACC schools, to present to administra-

tors and address any concerns, such as hours 7

of operation and students’ food allergies,
that students may have with campus dining.

The survey asks questions such as how
often students frequent dining halls and
how often students would eat on-campus
if there were more campus dining options
on weekends.

Zurschmit said she has also been research-

ing the dining options and on-campus dining .

hours of operation all schools within the ACC.
Zurschmit said about 250 students have
already completed the survey, and she’s seek-
ing about 500 respondents.
Graeme Meyer v V - 1
Board member Meyer has been working

 

on a Tobacco Free Campus initiative.

Meyer created a survey to address the
amount of students who use tobacco prod-
ucts, what products they are using and how
often students are using tobacco products.

Meyer said the survey is pendingﬁnal
approval from Humphrey. Once Humphrey
approves the survey, campus groups Healthy
U and Panther Wellness will distribute the
survey at the Student Health Center.

Meyer also proposed the Crisis Relief
Fund pilot program which the Board passed
earlier this month.

Ellie Tsatsos Q

Board member Tsatsos has been work-
ing to create more _student-friendly space
in the ‘Schenley Quadrangle by adding more
benches and places for students to sit.

Tsatsos said she recently submitted a pow-
erpoint proposal, which included aversion of
the Quad with benches along the walkways
surrounding the parking lot, as well as with
benches and a grassy area covering the park-
ing spaces, to Humphrey.

Tsatsos said progress with the project
has been slow.

“Because oflong chains of communication
with high authority people, it takes a while
to get responses,” she said.

Tsatsos said she wants Humphrey to ap-
prove the proposal this semester so students
can use benches in the quad this summer.

Tsatsos said the addition of grassy areas
to the Quad will be a “huge, expensive task”
that might not be complete by the end of
Tsatsos’ term next year.

“I want to get the conversation [about the
initiative] rolling so that someone else can
come in and continue pushing for comple-
tion,”Tsatsos said. ' ~

Tsatsos will also workwith Zurschmit on
her initiative to strengthen campus dining
facilities. After they collect data from the din-
ing surveys, the Board members will create
proposals to submit to Sodexo. Q

cally in areas of self-defense.

She said that she is also working on a Stu-
dent Voice Initiative to involve the student
body in SGB projects. The program, she said,
would allow students to submit their ideas,

either on a new website designated for the
program or on social media sites, for future
SGB projects.

“There are only eight Board members,
and we can’t possibly know everything that
needs to be looked at or ﬁxed on campus,”
Klein said. “Hopefully this initiative will
improve that and increase the amount of
projects that SGB can get done in the future.”

Former Board President Gordon Loud-
erback completed an initiative that estab-
lished a campus project submission form
shortly into his tenure on the 2013 Board.

that they are as efficient as they can be for
students. 5

Abboud also created a recreational survey

ACT, SAT, PLUS, FAFSA: At ﬁrst
encounter, an unfamiliar parent
might confuse the acronym-lad-
en college application process
with a Dr. Seuss book. Unfortu-
nately, it is not that simple, edu-
cational or enjoyable.

While the many stages of ap-
plying and ﬁnancing might seem
like a simple script instilled in
our families’ financial plans
and in our guidance counselors’
speeches, not all students enjoy
those privileges.

The labyrinthine application
process leads too many under-
represented students, most no-
tably high-performing yet low-
income students, astray.

For students raised in a

household expecting to- prepare

its children for college, the_pro- .
V cess begins early. For parents, it

begins even earlier. By the time
we reached sixth grade, some of
our parents had__.beg’,un, making

By eleventh grade, we could i

recite the U.S. News and World

pondered which two colleges to

send our AP.test scores to. What

is more, though this might seem a

premature process for students,

for parents, the ﬁnancial plan-S
. ning begins before we ever even

would be so negligent as to allow

the latter? .

It’s‘ no wonder, given all these
obscure strategies and conven-
tions, that high-perfor1iiing,_low-

decline to apply to the most se-
lective universities and instead

more detailed CSS/Financial Aid Proﬁle
compiled by the most selective universi-
ties can be incredibly taxing. _
Moreover, if reading between the lines
of ﬁnancial aid and student expense in-
formation is; difficult for most families,
it is near impossible for students relying
on a guidance counselor splitting his or
her time between 1,200 students -— an
all-too-real ratio for the most under—re—

sourced public schools.

Ultimately, the provision of generous
ﬁnancial aid will not be enough to vindi-
cate selective universities of their elitist
and socioeconomically exclusive reputa-
tion — even if that reputation predates
their aid policy. It has become standard
practice now for Ivy League universities,
sitting on endowments larger than the

GDP of a small nation, to guarantee full— ’

tuition fiindingvfor lower-income families.
Harvard, for instance, requires no ﬁnan-
cial contribution whatsoever from fami-

lies earning less than $65,000 per year.

Even with this robust ﬁnancial aid
system, the question remains: Why do
high—achieving students from that income
bracket comprise a relatively lower por-
'tion of applicants to that university and
its equivalents?

If universities are serious about open-
ing their ivy~strewn gates to an incom—
ing class representative of the national

population, they must actively counter —

their elitist reputation by streamlining
and simplifying the application process. .

Rather than ‘complicating it by hiding ﬁ-
nancial aid beneath the sticker price or
expecting three SAT subject tests on top
of the standard SAT and ACT, universities
should work together to standardize ex-
pectations and make explicit the realistic
cost of attendance. -

When an entire publishing industry
can survive on.direction manuals for navi-
gating the college application process, it
should come as no surprise that many
students get lost. I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

1' Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Boston College Eagles are in second-to-
last place in the Atlantic Coast Conference,‘
just one game ahead of Acellar—dwelling Vir-
ginia Tech. But while they’ve won only three
conference games this season, the Eagles ac-
complished somethingthat the Pit Panthers
couldn’t do in two attempts: defeat Syracuse.

On Wednesday, the ﬁfth—place Panthers
(20-7, 8-6 ACC) travel to Chestnut Hill, Mass.,
to face the 14th—place Eagles (7-20, 3-11 ACC),
The Panthers are looking to end their three-
game losing streak with their NCAA Tourna-
ment hopes in increasing peril.

For head coachjamie Dixon, the matchup
presents an opportunity for his Panthers to
begin correcting the errors that have plagued
them for the last month.

“We have to go get it right against Boston
College,” Dixon said after Sunday’s game. “We
need to work on our execution, work on our
patience and play better.”

Boston College visited then-No. 1 Syracuse
on Feb. 19 and left the Carrier Dome with a62-
59 overtime win, becoming the ﬁrst team to
ﬁnally clip the Orange in late—game scenarios.
On the other hand, Pitt lost to the Orange
each time the teams played, and Syracuse
closed each victory with a 10-2 run despite
the Panthers leading each game with minutes
remaining.

Following the Syracuse loss, the Panthers
dropped a road contest at North Carolina in
which redshirt senior forward Lamar Pat-
terson and redshirt junior guard Cameron
Wright struggled with foul trouble. Eight days
later, Pitt returned home and lost to Florida
State on Sunday.

Pitt has lost ﬁve of its past seven games
and is 4-6 in its last 10 contests. But the Pan-
thers still own more conference wins than
the Eagles have totaled between league and
non-conference play.

While beating a team such as Boston Col-
lege won’t do much to help the Panthers get
off the bubble, a loss would be debilitating to
Pitt’s chances.

“We know what we are here to do, make
the NCAA Tournament,” Dixon said. “We have
put ourselves in a pretty good position, now
we have lost three in a row. You can only take
so many losses.”

The Panthers will enter the Silvio O. Conte

    SPORTS

Mired in three-game losing skid Pitt takes on Boston

Forum as favorites tonight, but both team’s
recent results —— Pitt mired in aslump, Boston
College proving it can hold its ground against
the best — indicate nothing is a guarantee,
especially if the Panthers continue shooting
as poorly as they did against Florida State.

They shot just 37 percent from the ﬁeld
and 64.3 percentfromthe free-throw line. But
the misﬁrings are just one issue Patterson has
seen during Pitt’s recent struggles.

“Our defense, rebounding and our shots
haven’tbeen falling,” he said. “When we ﬁxall
of that, we will start winning again.”

Olivier Hanlan leads Boston College into
action with his average of 18 points per game,

which also ranks third in the ACC. Hanlan -

scored 20 points in the win over Syracuse,
but folldwed that win with an 11-point per-
formance in a 27-point loss to Miami in the
Eagles’ last game. ’

Patterson ranks just below Hanlan in the
league’s scoring ranks at 17.2 points per game
and posted 22 points in the Panthers ﬁve—point
loss to the Seminoles. Of his 22 total points,
16 came in the ﬁnal 2:56 as Patterson made
four 3—pointers to keep Pitt close before he
fouled out.

The redshirt senior from Lancaster, Pa.,
also leads the team in passing with 4.4 as-
sists per game. l

But, the ACC Player of the Year candidate
has struggled lately mostly because of an in-
jured right hand, which has been taped for
the past four games. Since the Panthers lost
to Duke onjan. 27, Patterson is averaging just
more than 15 points per game on 31 percent
shooting in seven games. A

Next to Patterson, redshirt senior center
Talib Zanna leads the Panthers in rebound-
ing at 8.1 boards per game and is scoring12.2
points per game. Like Patterson, though,
Zanna has also struggled lately. _

Zanna, who has shot 54.9 percent from
the ﬁeld so far this season, has made just one-
third of his ﬁeld goals in his past seven games

(16—for-48) and has topped double-digit scor— » 

ingjustthree times. In the ﬁrst 20 games ofthe
season, Zarma failed to reach the double-digit
plateau just three times and, at one point,
scored 10 or morein nine consecutive games.

Behind Zanna and Pattersogfs offensive
struggles, the Panthers have struggled as a
unit. Against Florida State, Pitt made only 20
ﬁeld goals and missed 10 free throws.

After witnessing and being a part of per-

formances like Pitt’s on Sunday, Wright said
he thinks the Panthers might be beating them-

Pitt shot a paltry 37 percent against Florida State

SWIMMING & DIVING

Another challenge aw,

‘Dan Sostek
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Panthers men’s swimmin'g and diving
team has a tough act to follow. ‘

A week after Pitt’s women’s swimming
and diving team enjoyed a successful bout
at the team’s ﬁrst- ever Atlantic Coastal Con-
ference championship meet — in which the
team broke seven school records and ﬁnished
eighth overall —- the men’s team heads down
to Greensboro, N.C., on Tuesday for the ACC
championships that begin today and continue
through Saturday.

But trying to duplicate or better the wom-

“ en’s contingent isn’t the ﬁrst challenge the

men’s team has faced this year. -
The team, currently 5-2 on the season,
ﬁnished third in the Big East championships
last year, but had to replace 11 departing
swimmers in 2013-2014. Also, head coach
Chuck Knoles said m an interview on the team
website that the ACC is “a very, very strong

. swimming and diving conference,” adding,

“We are going to be walking into a conference
championship that’s much different than the
Big East. We’re going to be ﬁghting for any
position we can ge ” .

Nonetheless, Knoles said he’s excited to
enter atoumamentthat has been so precisely
organized to ensure high levels of competi-
tion. ‘

“[The conference] is going to run a ﬁrst-
class event at aﬁrst—class facility,” he said. “It’s
going to be a nice competition.”

Despite the turnover from just a year ago

and the fact that the roster sports only two '
seniors, the men’s team does have a handful '

of standout swimmers and divers to keep an

A single week of college basketball can alter
any team’s season, especially when it’s a top-

rankedjsquad. A single moment in abig game ‘

can trump a quietly impressive season, and
that moment only gains impact when it comes
from a Hall of Fame coach for a No. 1 team.
Syracuse was undefeated and sat atop the
Top 25 polls for the past three weeks, but the
Orange were stunned Wednesday at home by

eye on come the time of the championships,
all ‘of which can be streamed onitwhe ACC’s
oflicial website. _ W "  ‘

David Sweeney — Sweeney, a sopho-
more out of Acworth, Ga., took the Panthers
swimming and diving scene by storm last
year, securing the 2012-2013 team’s top times
in the 100-meter, 200-meter, 300‘-meter,
500-meter and 1,000-meter freestyles. In
the process, Sweeneywas named team MVP
as a freshman for his efforts.

The sophomore slump hasn’t plagued
him either. He has been just as successful in
the 2013-2014 season, postingthe team’s top
times in the 100-meterfreestyle,‘ 200-meter
freestyle and500-meter freestyle. He looks
to continue to  on what, in aishort span
of time, is already avery impressive resumé.

Boston College, then secured back-to-back
losses with a 66-60 defeat Saturday at Duke.

Given the losses, Syracuse slipped in the
rankings to No. 4, butsuch a dip only means
that the ACC isn’t as top-heavy as it seemed
just a week ago.

While more conference games have in-
creasingly come down to the wire, two of
the season’s most exciting games have been
between Syracuse and Duke.

The ﬁrst matchup in Syracuse on Feb. 1
was deﬁned by high scoring, a buzzer beater

Kourosh Ahani —— A junior out of Rich-
mond'Hill, Toronto, Ahani is arguably the
most accomplished swimmer on the squad._A
2013 NCAA national meet participant, Ahani
has never lost a 100-meter butterﬂy race,
and, as a high school student, was the fastest
50-meter and 100-meter butterﬂy swimmer
in all of Canada. He also holds Pitt’s record for
the 100-meter butterfly, which he set at last
year’s Big East championship and has four of
the team’s ﬁve best times in the 100-meter
butterﬂy.

Mack Rice -— Like fellow sophomore
Sweeney, Rice impressed last year as afresh-
man, setting a new program record in‘ the
200-meter individual medley at the Big East
championships. Hailingfrom Cincinnati, Rice
has posted the Panthers’ best times this sea-

Virginia to top

and overtime. The second, on Saturday, was
deﬁned by Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim’s
berserk court-stormingfollowing a question-
able charge call on Orange forward C._]. Fair.

With 10.8 seconds left and his team down
60-58, Fair drove past Duke’s Tyler Thornton
along the baseline underneath Syracuse’s bas-
ket. Seeing his teammate in trouble, Duke’s
Rodney Hood slid into Fair’s projected path
to the hoop, hopingto draw an offensive foul.

Hoodwas knockedto the ground on Fair’s
way to a made layup.

son in the 50-meter backstroke, 100-meter
backstroke and the 200-meter individual

Zach Lierley — One of two freshmen
who has madeabig impact in the 2013-2014
season, Lierley, -the brother of Pitt junior
swimmerjon Lierley —- the record holder for

» Pitt’s 200-meter butterﬂy -— has impressed

in his ﬁrst year of collegiate swimming. Out of
Mount Pleasant, S.C., Lierley has posted the
three best times for the team this year inthe‘
200-meter backstroke as well as the top two
marks in 400-meter individual medley and
three of the top ﬁve times in the 200-meter
individual medley. He was also a member of

Swimming D 10

of conference

Standingwithinjan arm’s length of the col-
lision, official Tony Greene blew his whistle
and ruled that Hood’s feet had come to a halt
before Fair’s feet left the ﬂoor, and a charge
ensued." Boeheim responded by tearing off
his coat, stoinping on the ﬂoor and rushing
after Greene in rage. Greene issued a double
technical on Boeheim, resulting in ejection,
which was Boeheim’s ﬁrst in 1,260 career
games.

Breakdown D 9

“I just thought that was the worst call of
the year,” Boeheim told reporters after the
loss. “I just hate to see the game decided by
that call.”

Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said that he
thought Hood had his feet set and that the
oﬂicials correctly called it a charge.

Boeheim then spurred laughter when he
half—jokingly explained his intentions for
rushing onto the court and after Greene.

“I wanted to see if I still had it in me to go

 

out there, and I did,” he said. “I thought I was

quick. I stayed down, and I didn’t get injured,
so all those things are good.”

Boeheim said that he thinks his actions
will resonate with fans for years to come.

“People will remember this one for 30
years because the old coach went out there a
little bit, got excited, so they’ll always remem-
ber me for something,” he said. “I think fans
will rememberjim Boeheim here after that.”

Oddly enough, though, his facetious state-
ment carries a bit of truth. Boeheim could
become more remembered for his ejection
thanvirginia head coach Tony Bennett could
for his team’s historical season.

The Cavaliers have moved into an outright

lead in the ACC, but seem to have gone un-

noticed in doing so.
Here are The Pitt News’ updated power
rankings.

Virginia (23-5, 14-1 ACC)

The Cavaliers have jumped not only to a
conference lead, but they now lead the coun-
try in scoring defense (55.3 points per game)
as well. They blew out Notre Dame over the
weekend, and they have to survive on the road
tonight against Miami in order to set up the
ACC’s potential regular-season title game at
Syracuse on Saturday.

Syracuse (26-2, 13-2 ACC)

The Orange continue to struggle, but
picked up a close win at Maryland on Mon-
day. Orange reserve center Baye Moussa Keita
has returned from a knee injury, a boost for
forward Jerami Grant and center Rakeem
Christmas, who has struggled to stay out
of foul trouble. Syracuse has the week off to
prepare for its showdown against Virginia.

Duke (22-6, 11-4 ACC)

A poor start to conference play will re-
strict the Blue Devils from ﬂirting with a late
race for ACC supremacy. They could be swept
by North Carolina next Saturday, but have to
travel to Wake Forest on Wednesday ﬁrst.

North Carolina (20-7, 1o-4 ACC)

in the month of February, but they will close
out the season with a rough stretch of games.
They travel to North Carolina State tonight
and to Virginia Tech and Duke next week.
They host Notre Dame in between.

Pitt (20-7, 8-6 ACC)

Pitt has lost three straight and 5—of-7. Mike

= DeCourcy of Sporting News suggested that

Pitt’s late—game losses have come because
they lackasecondary scoringthreatto Lamar
Patterson. V

“By in large, they’re pretty much in a situ-

I ation where they kind of have to grind those

last few minutes and hope to get enough op-
portunities,” DeCourcy said. “I think if [Pat-
terson] has some help, he could certainly get
them through some late situations against
quality teams.”

Clemson (17-9, 8-6 ACC)

There’s a good chance that the Tigers will I

be on aﬁve—game winning streak heading into
their regular~season ﬁnale against Pitt. They
host Maryland and Miami next week and
will probably have to win out before being
considered a bubble team. ’

Florida State (16-11, 7-8 ACC) .

The Seminoles are among ESPN’s ﬁrst
four out of the NCAA Tournament right now
because of early season wins against Virginia
Commonwealth and Massachusetts alongside
an overtime loss to No. 16 Michigan and a one-
point loss to No. 1 Florida. They will need to
win each game remaining, including a season
ﬁnale against Syracuse at home next week.

North Carolina State (17-10, 7-7 ACC)

The Wolfpack host North Carolina at 8
p.m. Forward T.J. Warren still leads all ACC
scorers with 23.3 points per game.

Maryland (15-12, 7-8 ACC)

Against Syracuse on Monday, the Ter-
rapins couldn’t convert on a handful of late
opportunities. With 49 seconds remaining,
Mary1and’s]ake Layman missed a layup that
would have tied the game; with nine seconds
remaining, Keita blocked Terrapins guard
Nick Faust’s go—ahead layup attempt; and
ﬁnally, as time expired, Terrapins guard
Seth Allen heaved a running 30-footer that
rimmed out. Maryland lost 57-55 and plays
next at-Clemson on Sunday.

Miami (14-13, 5-9 ACC)

The Hurricanes might have a tough time .

transformingtheir two-game winning streak
into three in a row, as Miami travels to play
Virginia tonight at 7.

Notre Dame (14-14, 5-10 ACC)

The Irish have lost two in a row and will
host an equally unimpressive Georgia Tech
team tonight at 7. lg '

Wake Forest (14-13 ,’ 4-10 ACC)

The—Demon Deacons have dropped sev-
en straight, but they return home for three
games, including a matchup against Duke
next Wednesday. .

Georgia Tech (13-14, 4-10 ACC)

The Yellowjackets travel to Notre Dame,
Florida State and Syracuse before return-
ing home to play Virginia Tech to close out
a poor season.

Boston College (7-20, 3-11 ACC)

The Eagles pulled off the upset of the sea-
son at Syracuse on Wednesday. They then
traveled to Miami and lost by 27.

Virginia Tech (9-17, 2-12 ACC)

No favorable opportunities remain for the
Hokies. to pull themselves out of last place.
They play at Duke and home against North
Carolina and then travel to Maryland and
Georgia Tech to close out the season. I

selves at times, especially on the offensive end.
“The game is simple,” Wright said’. “We
are making it difﬁcult on ourselves and taking
tougher shots.” »
But while players such as Wright and Pat-
terson have seen the downsides, they still have

- hope. Patterson, who has struggled as much

as any Panther recently, still said he isn’t as
worried about Pitt’s postseason chances as
bracketologists seem to be.

“I thinkwe will get it done,” Patterson said.
“We signed up forthe pressure, and wewillbe
