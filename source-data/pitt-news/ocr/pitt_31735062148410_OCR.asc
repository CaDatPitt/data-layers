What is the opinion on the ROTQ
today amongthose young people for}
whom this military training is in
tended, who will have to join‘, that
battle lines in case of war? Na-is
‘tional student opinion on this mat-,5
for has never before been! known;
with accuracy. V  j. _ 
The Student Opinion Surveys of
America, cooperatingvswith the Pitil
News and 150 other college newspa-,?
pers, presents it for the ﬁrst time. ;

Do you believe ROTC military‘:
training—either compulsory or vol-If
untary--should be taught in colleges
and u'niversities—or do you believe
it should not be taught at all?’.’ was
the question asked by its inter-j
viewers». 1 ‘_ L?

The survey found approval with
these variations; \ 3

1.‘ Although a good majority am;
gin" favor .in every section of 
lgcountry, the largest number of dis-1
lsenters-one-ﬁfth in each case—-;
iwas found in the East Central and
«lWest.Central“states. I A f
 2. ‘Only 4' per cent more women,
.;than men are opposed to the ROTC‘;
E 3. Military training is most pop-7
ular in schools where it is voluntary,
least where it isn’t taught at all.

4. Of students who approve, well
over half. believe it should be vol-
untary only. 1

Of all the students answering the
question, 86 per cent approve and
14 per cent disapprove.’ Voluntary
training is believed to be‘ necessary
by 58 per cent,‘l3 per cent think it
should be compulsory and the rest
failed to answer the question».

In schools where training:is‘v‘ol-
untary 96 per cent approve and in
schools where training is compul-
sory 92 per cent approve of the
training. Only 82 per cent approve
in; schools where it is notstaught.

University students did not get

their cokes, 15-centsandwiches, and

cool, clean glasses of water at the
new_ Cathedral cafeteria . when they
returned to classes Monday.

For, although’ the opening of the
new ground floor lunch room was
originally. scheduled for “sometime
in January” then postponed to Feb-
ruary 1, the February 5 visitors
found nothing but the smell of fresh
plaster and the dust from polished
marble. : O .

‘When asked for the latest esti-
mate as to when it will open, Ray-
mond F. Coss, superintendent of
building and grounds, stated, that
the: room will be completed in ap-
proximately three weeks “without

‘unforeseen difﬁeulties.” -

The. previous calculations were
made by Albert Klimcheck, Univer-
sity ‘architect, who has two dates
chalked up beside ‘his name. f

On Wednesday, September 27,
1939,, Mr. K_liInChe'ck ‘said “it will be
coi'np1eted“.by January.” On Fri-

day, January 12, 1940, _he. said “it.

would start operating February 1
pending the expected completion of
work by all .the ‘trades concerned.”
‘ Asyet no ofﬁcial name has been
given to the latest addition to the
eating facliries of the University.
Most common appellat.ion offered by’
students is “the Kathedral Kitchen-‘T
etc”:  .

“It’s a lotta bunk!” was the opin-

Joek Sutherland
Goes to the Dodgers

DR. JOHN BAIN SUTI-IERLAND is now head coach of the
Brooklyn Dodgers of the National Football league. He is no long-
er merely the former head coachvof the Pitt Panthers.

The announcement last week that “Jock” had entered pro-

fessional coaching marked the end of an era of athletics at the Uni-

versity. During Dr. Sutherland’s coaching career at Pitt, football
rose to a highly important position in the University ’s affairs.

The ﬁfteen years which “Jock” spent coaching Panther teams
saw Pitt become one of the foremost football powers in the nation.
His Pitt teams won 111 games, lost only 20, and tied 12. Dr. Suth-
erland developed seven Eastern championship eleveiis, and four
teams which played for the mythical national championship in the

Rose Bowl.

The ﬁnancial importance of football at Pitt musliroonied dur-

ing those years iiito a big business.

People of the Pittsburgh dis-

trict-‘came to look upon Pitt football as a community institution.
In the gridiron seasons following 1924, Pitt football enjoyed an era

of lush prosperity.

When Dr. Sutherland resigned last‘ spring a series of un-
pleasant events and rumors in the management of athletics at the

University reached a climax.

That Dr. Sutherland did not want to leave the University goes
without saying: In fact, his refusalto engage in active coaching
during the past football season had been interpreted as reluctance
to become associated with any other organization than the Univer-

sity - of Pittsburgh.

Some of his friends believed that the future of Pitt athletics

depended upon‘ his return. They believed, that if some administra-.

tive changeswere = forced through,  Sutherland might“ again be

Goacli Sutherland.

With Dr. Sutherland deﬁnitely committed to professional

coaching, however, those hopes that he might be brought back have
been dispelled. And those who have wanted to ﬁght to bring him

back have lost a large amount of their incentive for opposition to

the status quo at the University.

Any future opposition to the University administration of
athletic affairs must therefore be based on dislike of current
atliletic policies and on the idea of revenge against Chancellor Bow-
man, Secretary John Weber, and Athletic Director James Hagan
for their part in the actions which led up to the resignation of Dr.

Sutherland. ’

This controversy has apparently died out, and is only a debat-
able issue among Pitt followers at the present time. This issue how-
ever, does not characterize Dr. Sutherland’s career.

-. Dr. Sutherland will be remembered at the University for his

25 years of service as student, teacher, and coach.

His work was

representative of the best in Pitt spirit.

The Building Program
And Student Opinion

JUST BEFORE FINALS last semester the News printed the
results of its poll on the question: Which of the projects in the

pleted ﬁrst?

, Ghancellor’s $6,000,000 building program would you like to see com-

The ﬁrst choice by a good margin was for completion of the,
Cathedral, a student union was what was wanted second, then came
the completion of the medical center, and fourth the construction

of laboratories in Thaw and Alumni Halls.

Fifth among the eight

projects scheduled was the improvement of the engineering labora-

tories.

Sixth, sci-veiitli and eighth, withoiily small percentages of

.~stiidents voting for them, were the projected skating rink, a new

zﬁeld lizouse, am] new playing ﬁelds.

Wheii. the building program was origina.lly presented, newspa-
jgper reports had the coinpletion of the Cathedral, the construction
of the chemistry laboratories, and the skating rink, or “winter

7)

sport arena

as it has been tagged for publicity, as the ﬁrst three
things to be done under the plan.

VVhile no oﬁicial pronounce-

ment has been niade afﬁrmiiig the story, neither has there been a
denial... So, it has come to be accepted as the University’s plan of

construction.

The results of the News poll indicate that the students, those
most affected by the new projects, have different ideas about the

necessity of certain facilities.

The skating rink, in particular, has

only 2,]. per cent of the student body interested in its early com-

pletion’.

In tll‘e‘llg‘ll’[ of this expression of opinion the News feels that the
University’s adniiiiistiration should adjust its projected order of
oonipleting the program to bring it into line with student opinion.

Cooperative Housing Offers
Eighty-Cent.-a-Day Schooling

COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS—-—

(AC‘.P).—-Twelve young men hap-
pened upon a “haunted” house and
a friend and the result is that 1,000
young men are atteiiding college
here on 82' cents ,a day.‘ Every-
~thitrg is i.n‘cluded—-—evenutuitioir arid
clothing.

The 1,000 students attend Agri-
cultural and Mechanical college of
Texas and are members of a stu-
dent co-operating housing project,
largest organization of its kind in
the U. S.

This housing project was begun
dui'ing* the -' depression years when
m»-a,.ny.lboys=wer.e notable to ﬁnance
thei_r~ education either by them-
selv s or with their parents’ aid.

Tod:—:Iy, the room and board of the
average student of Texas A and M
school costs him $29.75 a month, or
about one dollar a day.

-Twelve youths and Daniel Rus-
sell, professor of rural sociology,
had been working on the students‘

financial problems. They found
their answer in a haunted house, a
large two—story building near the
college's experimental farm. It was
a dilapidated and isolated place,
but the rent was very low.

The house was‘ furnished with ar-
ticle-si from the boys’ own liorr'i’e”s‘.
They engaged no paid help, ex-
cept the house mother who is given
a salary by the boys. They do all
such work as cleaning rooms, set-
ting table, and washing dishes
themselves.

The number of houses increased.
By 1936, 700 men were living under
this plan, and every available house
near the school had been rented.
The Rotary club became interested
and built a house for its own sons
and friends to accommodate 20 stu-
dents.

Six years ago 250 boys were not
permitted to attend the school be-
cause of insuiﬁcient funds. Today,
1,000 with no more money than
the 250 had are enrolled.

from the
Sidelines

By -Bill*McElwain
Sports Editor

It looked a little like a conspiracy. Between Christmas vaca-
tion and the day the News knocked off work to study for exams,

practically nothing happened in the great and somewhat befuddled
world of intercollegiate athletics. Then, with no News around to
report the gory details, things began to pop all over the place.

The district coaching situation was ﬁnally cleared up. Bill
Kern went to West Virginia and took with him Eddie Hirschberg,
Frank Kutz, and Mike Nicksick. Eddie Baker moved up to the
job of head man at Carnegie Tech and Muggsy Skladany became
Baker ’s ﬁrst assistant. As a crowning touch, D13 J 01111 Bain Suth-
erland, once an arch foe of professional football, relented and ac-
cepted a $12,000 a year job with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Good Luck, Eddie! You’ll Need It

Just what the future holds for these gentlemen is a bit of a
question. Brother Kern should do fairly well in Morgantown for
the Mountaineers have ﬁnally decided to do something about keep-
ing West Virginia football players in ‘Vest Virginia.

Across the hollow Dr. Baker is in for trouble. Simultaneous
with the doctor’s appointment, reports began to ﬁlter out of the
Skibo stronghold that a more than a fairish number of Baker’s
squad are either dropping out of school or heading for the proba-
tion list. Evidently Dr. Baker will need” all his professional skill in
extracting enough men for a ﬁrst team from the shattered Tartan
ranks.

Dr. Sutherland faces the next three years with the realization
that half of the pro followers are sure he-’ll turnout a good team,
but that the other -half are plainly skeptical. From his collegiate
record of fundamental football there is at least a suspicion that
the good doctor will get along.

However, the doctor, who now holdsthe amateur and open
denying titles of Western Pennsylvania and vicinity, may run into
trouble in a league where everybody else’s material is as good as
his own.

Mr. Dees Goes to Nebraska

Before dropping the football question it’ might be well to men-
tion the excitement caused by a rumored Pitt-Michigan football
game in 1940, which if it had gone through would have been the
ninth game on the schedule. Just when the wolves had their teeth
bared, ready to howl about “another crack in the Code Bowman,”
Michigan ﬁlled the date by scheduling the University of California.

Aside from Nicksick’s resignation, the only change in the
makeup of the athletic department staff was the departure of trainer
Elwyn Dees to accept a position at Nebraska. Dees had been here
only ﬁve months and was the fourth Pitt trainer in as many years.
In leaving, Dees broke with established precedent by claiming that
his reason for resigning was not dissatisfaction with the University
or anyone connected with it.

Shifting to basketball, the Panthers will donate the proceeds
of the Pitt-"West Virginia clash on February 20 to the Finnish relief
fund. An earlier proposal would have made Pitt’ one of four teams
competing in a doubleheader for the fund. Duquesne, Allegheny,
and ‘Wash-J eff were to have been the other three, but the Univer-
sity’s stand against post-season games precluded the possibility.

Intramural Outfits Point for Coming
Battles; Unbeaten Pitt Club Faces Jerks

With the mid-semester exams a
thing of the past, the various intra-
mural teams are pointing for the
coming games in the hope of either
adding to their prestige or improv-
ing their standings.

A showdown for the basketball
title is expected when the undefeat-

Phi Kappa, the pride of the fra-
ternities, takes on the Delta Tau
Delta ﬁve tomorrow. The high
scoring Phi Kaps again will be
banking on footballer Dick Cas-
siano for plenty of help.

Other important games will ﬁnd
the Punks battling the Upper Dent-

‘red Pitt Club meets-the title hungry
Jerks Friday. l3oth..teams have dis-
played outstanding form in earlier
games and are expectul to provide
the ﬁreworks of this week’s sched-
zule.

Although they have won most of
the victories via the forfeit route,
‘the Pitt Club hoopsters seem to
‘have the stuff to make them a dark-
horse for the title.

The defending champs, Newmans,
-should get by their game with the
College Hicks’ on Friday without
‘too much trouble. The title holders
have yet to be forced to their limit
in league competition.

ures Friday, the Theta Chi quintet
against their Pi Lambda Phi foe,
and S A M meeting Kappa Sigma,
the latter two matches slated to-
morrow. '

In today’s bowling, the Theta Chi
team perfoiims against Pi Kappa
Alpha. Also, Lambda Chi Alpha
goes to war with the Phi Delta The-
ta, and Phi Kappa tangles with the
Kappa Sigis.

Independent bowling tomorrow
ﬁndslthe Punks and the Chem Frosh
in a death grip, Gamma Gamma
Woo against the Chem Seniors, and
Amity meeting the Civil team.

Pitt, Jackets
Renew Cage

Series Here

Crack District Rivals
Battle in First Floor
Encounter Since I 929

Wlaynesburg and the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh re-establish
basketball relations this evening
when the Yellow Jackets and
Panthers renew a rivalry that
has lapsed since the days of the
stock market crash in 1929.

This will be the ﬁfth meeting of
the two squads; Pitt has won three
and Waynesburg three. In 1911, the
teams met for the ﬁrst time during
the era of the stuffed ball. Pitt won
on its home “ﬂoor 31-20 and the
Jackets copped a decision in their
court, 35-19.

Jackets Improve

A year later, Pitt trimmed the
Jackets for the second time, this a
38-31 win. In the 1928-29 season,
the Panthers once again tripped
their Waynesburg rivals, the 50-17
score being the most lop-sided in
the schools’ ﬂoor history.

Since the last meeting with the
Panthers, Waynesburg teams have
crowded better known district. ﬁves
from the top notches. Coach Frank
Wolf, former Penn State star, be-
sides supervising this crack cage
team, tries his hand at football tu-
toring in the fall.

It was only the past season that
the Jackets spilled Duquesne and
scrambled to the top of the district

 

GEORGE KOCHERAN

heap by taking their two games
with Westminster. Up to date,
Waynesburg has won eight of ten
games, losing to Duquesne and
Washington and Jefferson. The loss
to the Presidents came in the last
30 seconds as Howy Tidrick con-
nected to top the Jackets, 43-41.

Pitt, on the other hand, has climb-
ed to about eighth position in dis-
trict standing the hard way. They
faced stubborn opposition on their
mid-western trip which accounted
for their four losses in ﬁve attempts.
Simmers Outstanding

Since that disastrous trip, the
Golden Cats have been traveling
high, wide and handsome. They
have won ﬁve of their last six starts
and have impressed locals with their
high scoring and close checking de-
fense, a combination of zone and
man-to-man defense which has
proved more than effective.-'

Outstanding this season i for the
visiting ﬁve have been Bob Sim-
mers, high scorer deluxe, and Jerry
Pasquale, another efficient point
getter. Simmers was a student at
the University for a short time.

The probable Pitt starting line-up
will show Straloski and Port at for-
wards, Pataky at center, and Koch-
eran and Collins at the guards.

Buckeye Swimmers Sink Pitt;
Records Fall in Close Finishes

Ohio State’s highly touted swim-
ming team, rated by those in the
know as second only to the Univer-
sity of Michigan in aquatic ability,
defeated the University of Pitts-
burgh splashers in the latter’s ﬁrst
meet of the season at the Metropol-
itan club last Saturday night by the
one-sided score of 55 to 20.

However lopsided the score may
seem, nearly all of the events ended
in what race fans term “photo-ﬁn-
ishes.” Harold Stanhope, back
stroke; Bob Higgins, breast stroke;
and John Nixon in the free style set
a new pool in defeating by a
yard the Panther trio of Al Beacon,
Herb Cosgrove, and Joe Orloff in
the 300-yard medley relay with the
fast time of 3:02.5.

Higgins later beat Pitt’s Cosgrove
in the breast stroke event, ﬁnishing
in 2:30.7, 3.6 seconds below the pre-
vious pool record which Higgins
himself set in 1938.

The treat of the evening for the
ﬁve hundred fans present proved to
be the diving efforts of Al Patnik.
He accumulated an amazing point
total of 147.43. Pitt’s Dick Ames’
exhibition of diving skill was good
enough to capture top honors
against anybody but Patnik, who is
absolutely in a class by himself.

The only event won by the Pitt
mermen was taken by Joe Orloff,
sensational sophomore swimmer, in
the 100-yarl free style race. His
time was 56.5, three seconds off the
present pool record.

Coach Ben Grady of the Panthers
seemed pleased with the showing his
boys made against Ohio State. It is
his contention that with hard work
and a few breaks along the line of
injuries, the Pitt swimmers should

ﬁnuish the season with quite an en-
viable record.

The defeat, Grady feels, should
have provided the Panthers with
experience enough to give both
Penn State and Michigan, their
next two opponents, considerable
competition. The Lion swim-
mers come to Pittsburgh Friday
night, the Wolverines providing
the opposition at Buffalo on Satur-
day.
