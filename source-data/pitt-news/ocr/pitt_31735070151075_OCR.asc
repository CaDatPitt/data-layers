Sﬂxﬂihennyer
retires after
134l3naars

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

Rande Stottlemyer, the win-
ningest coach in Pitt wrestling
history, has retired, accord-
ing to a statement released by
Pitt Monday. The Pitt alum had
coached the team, for which he
was a three-time All-American
as a student, since 1979, a year
after he graduated. g

' “I would like to thank the
University of Pittsburgh for the
great opportunity they gave me
as a young man, fresh out of col-
lege,” Stottlemyer, 54, said in
the release. “I have been blessed
to have lived my passion for 35
years. I hope in that time I have
been able to make a positive
impact on a lot of young men’s
lives. It has been an honor to be
their coach and to promote the
great sport of wrestling.”

He finished with an all-time
record of 304—230—12, leading
Pitt to win the last three Eastern
Wrestling League tournament
titles, as well as three regular-
season titles since 2010.

Pitt athletic director Steve
Pede_rson praised him.

“Very few coaches retire at
the top of their game, and yet
Rande Stottlemyer is doing just
that,” Pederson said. “Not only
has Rande led our wrestling
program to the top of the East-
ern Wrestling League, but he is
also held in the highest regard
by everyone in our Athletic De-
partment. It would be hard to

Termination
looms for

nationality
room

Cassidy Davis

For the many cultural groups who
have built Nationality Rooms in
the Cathedral of Learning, the

rooms represent pride in their .

regional heritages. But in-ﬁghting
among the city’s Filipino commu-
nity now threatens to prevent the
development of its own room.

The Filipino American Asso-
ciation of Pittsburgh originally
started planning forthe Philippine
Nationality Room.10 years ago,
but changes to the group’s bylaws
in 2010‘ created a divide within
the organization that has caused
University administrators to halt
progress.

The argument, which has per-
sisted for two years and regards
changes to the FAAP bylaws made
by the organization’s board in
2010, led the University to de-
cide to terminate the project, for
which the group had already raised
$270,000and ﬁnalized ﬂoorplans.

’ Pitt has said- it will hold the
$270,000 for the room’s creation
already supplied to the University
until it determinesthe people to
whom Pitt should return the do-
nated money. _

Larry Feick, director of the Uni-
versity Center for International
Studies, said the University tried
to give the group time to work out
its disagreements but had to take

“|nternship queen” shares
tricks of the trade

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Lauren Berger found the business card
on the floor, and a decision needed to
be made.

As a college intern with BWR Public
Relations, a large public relations firm
in Los Angeles, Berger stumbled across
the contact information for Ken Baker,
at that time the West Coast Editor for Us
Weekly. Berger’s dream job had always
been to work for Us Weekly. Finding the
card, she had to decide whether to take
the plunge and contact Baker.

“I decided I was going to email my new
friend,” Berger said.

Her initiative ultimately earned her
an internship with Us Weekly. Her first
assignment at her dream job was an un-
dercover investigation in Barbados to
learn why actors Denise Richards and
Charlie Sheen had engaged in a supposed
feud on the island.

Berger advised the 40 students gath-
ered in the 0’Hara Student Center Ball-
room to hear her speak last night that her
experience should serve as an example of
the need to take initiative when pursuing
internships. Known as “the internship
queen,” Berger has worked at a total of
15 internships, and she used stories from
those internships to relay to students
lessons to help them land internships,
as well. .

“Let’s get something clear —— no one
needs 15 internships,” Berger said. “I do
suggest everyone get 2 to 3 internships.”

As a freshman in college, Berger never
imagined that she would become the “in-
ternship queen.”

“I want to go to Florida State. I want
to party, I want to drink, I want to have a
great time,” Berger said, referring to her

mindset when entering college.

But at her mother’s insistence, Berger
applied for her first internship with the
Zimmerman Agency, a public relations
firm in Tallahassee, Fl.

Berger used the story of her first in-
ternship interview to highlight two im-
portant points of interview etiquette: the
need to dress right for an interview and
the essential act of sending a handwritten
thank you note to the interviewer in the
days following the meeting.

“You have to get in habitlof following

up with people instantly,” Berger said,
adding that such actions show dedication

. and interest.

Berger also said she researched the

Zimmerman Agency extensively before

even applying.

After finding success at the Zimmer-
man Agency, Berger was able to use the
connections she created there to findnew
internships, including stints with MTV,
Fox and NBC. ,

“Stay in touch with all professional
contacts 3 times per year,” Berger recom-
mended. “I reach out to say happy birth-
day, to say happy holiday — dropping
four—line emails just to stay in touch.”

Berger said many people make the
mistake of only getting in touch with
professional contacts when they need
something.

Senior Angelica Wroblewski read
Berger’s book, “All Work, No Pay,” over
the summer and said the author was
equally inspirational in person.

“She really does love what she does,”
Wroblewski said.

Berger’s visit was a part of the Ford
College Ambassador Challenge. Four Pitt
students — seniors Adam Gaus, Nicol-
lette Bevec, Arie Lombardozzi and sopho-
more Sara Klein -— are participating in
a three-part marketing challenge against
teams from the University of Michigan,
University of Louisville, University of
Minnesota and University of Illinois to
promote Ford cars. One of the’ events
for the challenge wasltol,attract as many
students as possible to hear Berger speak.

The remaining parts of the Ambas-
sador Challenge are ongoing contests.
April 25 is the deadline for the second
part of the challenge, in which the four
competing teams are racing to get 120
people to test drive a Ford vehicle. For the
third part of the challenge, the Pitt team
created a promotional video for Ford that
is posted online at www.internqueen.
com/ford.

People can log onto the website
through April 25 to vote for the Pitt team’s
video. The team that garners the most
votes for the video wins that part of the
challenge. Team leader Gaus said Pitt
currently leads the voting with 473 votes,
and he encouraged other Pitt students to
keep up their efforts. _

“Right now, we’re kind of kicking butt,
so keep it going,” he said.-

action when that failed to happen.

“The University deeply regrets that this
controversy in the community makes it not
able to go forward with the room,” Feick said.
“When we get the audit done, we will start
sending the money back. And when that hap-
pens, it will be really hard to get this thing
started again.”

The FAAP’s internal conﬂict

The controversy within the group began
when Warren Bulseco, formerly the chair of
the Philippine Nationality Room Committee
but not a member of the FAAP board, lost his
role as committee chair because of changes
the board made to the organization’s bylaws

‘in 2010.

Jaime Abola, current president and former
secretary of the FAAP, explained that two

years ago, the FAAP decided to abrogate, or .

and betterment for the FAAP organizations,
and I hope the revisions are approved,” the
email, signed by Bulseco and sent from what
appears to be his email address, said.

Bulseco declined to comment on the email '

or to say whether he had written it.

Abola said he originally objected to the
abrogated bylaws because he feared Bulseco’s
ousting would create a divide in the group,
but he said he withdrew his objection after
receiving the email from Bulseco. According

to Abola, the membersvof the FAAP voted ,

on the changes at the group’s annual sum-
mer picnic in 2010, and the board selected
Teodora Schipper as the new chair of the Na-
tionality Room committee in October 2011.

The vote at the annual picnic —— the or-
ganization’s one general meeting of the year
4 has now become a point of contention
among the group members.

Cathy Manalo, a current member and for-
mer president of the FAAP, said that as far as
she was aware, none of the members of the
FAAP knew changes to the group’s bylaws

“We have a really serioustproblemu
here. It doesn’t reflect very well on
our community.”

‘Jaime Abola‘

I heavily revise and readopt, its bylaws. The

modiﬁcations included the addition of a rule
that each chair of a subcommittee within the
FAAP had to be a member of the FAAP board.

The Philippine Nationality Room Commit-
tee, in addition to being an official National-
ity Room committee under the jurisdiction
of the University Center for International
Studies, is a subcommittee of the FAAP. As
such, under the new bylaws, its chair had to
be a board member.

Bulseco —— who was also the architect
of records for the Nationality Room com-
mittee — said he was not informed of the
implications of the bylaw changes before
they took place. »

“They did not notify me that I would lose
my position,” Bulseco said, referring to or-
ganizers of the FAAP. '

But Abola claimed that Bulseco was aware
that he would lose his position as chair after
the bylaw changes. Abola provided an email
he said was sent to members of the FAAP
and the Nationality Room committee by the
former committee chair. if

“I have NO issue with this, as the pro-

posed bylaw revisions are an improvement

A were coming before they were voted on. She

also takes issue with the actual vote, which
she claims took place without the quorum of
members required for a vote by the group’s
constitution. ' .
But Abola stated that the amendments

have been in the process of becoming ﬁnal- _

ized since 2005, and he does not believe that

. people were not aware of the changes to be

made. He said all documentation for the
changes is available online, including original

documents, and that the group’s organizers ’

send out an FAAP newsletter regularly that
included an announcement that the vote
would be taking place at the summer picnic.

Regarding the vote, Abola acknowledged

that the FAAP’s constitution states that two— I

thirds of the group members’ votes are need-
ed to pass an amendment to the constitution.
However, Abola said that since the board was
not amending the constitution but adopting
a modiﬁed set of bylaws, the voting process
could be governed by a different rule that
states that a simple majority vote of the or-
ganization’s general membership is needed

‘ ‘ Nationality D 3_ 2

to pass bylaws.

And although, as Manalo pointed out, a
quorum of voters did not actually place their
votes at the picnic, Abola said that since the
51 percent quorum of members was present,
the board could consider the vote valid.

Abola said that the proposed changes

1 received a majority of the vote at the annual

picnic, which is why the bylaws passed.

Shortly after the new bylaws were ad-
opted, however, the University contacted
the FAAP stating that administrators were
concerned about Bulseco’s elimination from
the committee. Manalo said that when the
disagreement with Pitt was brought to the
FAAP board’s attention, the group’s organiz-
ers failed to notify the rest of the member-
ship. A

“Nobody was expecting it, nobody knew.
The FAAP never notiﬁed members that there
was a controversy. They started to deal with
the University and tried to ensure their side
was the only side,” Manalo said.

The University gets involved

As soon as she was informed that the
changes were installed, Maxine Bruhns, a
representative from the Nationality Rooms
Program for Pitt, took action.

The FAAP received a letter from the Uni-

versity, written by Bruhns and now posted’
1 on the FAAP website, requesting that the

board maintain Bulseco as the Nationality

Room committee chair, “to ensure that the
quality of service and design requiredby the
Nationality Rooms Program and the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh will continue.”

Bruhns said that with the change to its
bylaws, the FAAP violated the spirit of the
Nationality Room committee rules, since
the general ideals require that the commit-
tee be an open—membership group without
any outsideaorganization exerting authority
over it. She’ said the FAAP rule within the
group requiring that the Nationality Room
committee chair be a member of the group’s
board limited the ability of non-FAAP board
members to contribute.

She also said this was the ﬁrst time plans

for a Nationality Room have ever been ter- '

minated..

While Manalo and Feick both pointed
out that a number of donors to the ﬁind for
the proposed Nationality Room were not
members of the FAAP, a “Perspective and
Response” to the issue posted on the group’s

website insists that Pitt acknowledge the .

FAAP as “the owner of the [Philippine Na-
tionality Room] project.” 1

“For over 10 years, the FAAP worked tire-
lessly to make plans and raise ﬁinds neces-

. sary for the room’s completion,” states the

perspective issued by FAAP organizers.
Abola said the problem has persisted be-
cause he doesn’t know with whom to work
within the FAAP to solve the problem, since
he doesn’t know who his opposition is. He
speculated, however, that Manalo is leading
the opposing front. A
Manalo stated that she is not leading a

faction against Abola or other members of
the FAAP directly, but that she is voicing her
opinion for many others who agree. She said
that originally, the committee accepted ev-
eryone who wanted to partake.

“There are many others that are upset, as
well, and I have chosen to be the spokesper-
son,” Manalo said.

Injune 2012, after several meetings orga-
nized by Feick between Schipper, Bulseco and
other members of the FAAP board in attempts
to resolve the contention, the organization
received another letter from the University
announcing the termination of the project.

‘ “As no meaningful progress has been
made within the Filipino community to re-
solve the enduring impasse relating to the
composition and governance of the [Phil-

ippine Nationality Room Committee], the

University has come to the conclusion that
this situation is irreparable,” stated the letter,
written by Feick.

“I write to you with the knowledge that
this project has been a labor of love for many
individuals in the community, and I am deep-
ly saddened by this unprecedented and very
disappointing turn of events.”

Resolutions remain

Abola has started an online petition to
push this mission further. The petition asks
the University to withhold termination to
see if the FAAP can try toresolve the issue
by itself. Voting closed more than six months
ago, with 228 signatures from people who
believe the Nationality Room should be built.
People from as far away as California joined

in the signing of the petition.

Manalo commented on the online peti-
tion, calling it “a joke.” She said that putting
up an online petition where you can tell all
your family members to sign is not an accu-
rate representation of the community, add-
ing that she could double those numbers
with people who are actually involved in the
project.

Manalo said she would like for the Uni-
versity to accept the original, long—standing
Philippine Nationality Room Committee in
its entirety to complete the room. She wants
those who started the project to complete
the project. i

“The [Nationality Room] committee that
has put over 10 years of time and effort into
this process should continue and ﬁnalize
the last year to get this up and running. It
shouldn’t be about grandeur, it should be
about hard work,” Manalo said.

Abola has said his solution is sitting down
with the opposing members of the FAAP and
discussing the present issues. He’d then for-
mulate a solution that doesn’t insist on who’s
right or wrong.

“After a while, it has become personal,”
Abola said. “We have a really serious prob-
lem here. It doesn’t reﬂect very well on our
community.”

Feick said that leaders of the project could
avoid full termination if the community can
resolve its internal issues and come to a con-
sensus.

“They still haven’t come up with the abil-
ity to speak with one voice,” Feick said. “I’m
hoping the community can get together.” I

THE PROFESSIONAL PUPIL V I
Make jobs and extracurricular activities
relevant when applying for jobs

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

Helping a friend this past week-
end with his job search made me

' remember that without relevant

prior experience, employability

, can be non-existent. ' .
q When looking for a job, most ,

would agree that having any job
experience — even in an unrelated
ﬁeld — is preferableover having
none at all. But I had trouble jus-
tifying the addition of “waiter” to

, the work experience section of my

friend’s resumé. Ihad little trouble

imagining his would-be employer
skipping to the next resume as he
-looked for another full-time re-

search assistant to join his lab.

The phrase “prior experience”

is a tough one to_digest. While we -

were considering it, we were won-
dering about the worth of work
experience while in college. Time
is money, and we wondered how
we should be spending our time.
Let’s say you’re in the fortunate
position to be able to live comfort-
ably as a college student without
needing a part—time job. It’s bet-

ter to focus on-getting involved
with a relevant extracurricular
activity than it is to accept part.-
time, irrelevant paid work. In my
friend’s case, being a volunteer lab
assistant or participating with a re-
search science project could carry
more weight than being a waiter in
a potential employer’s eyes.
Besides improving leadership
and interpersonal skills,’ extracur-
ricular involvement allows stu-
dents to link academic knowledge
with practical experience. Future
employers seek individuals with
increased skill levels, ‘making these
involved students more attractive

on the job market. Speciﬁcally, -
participation in extracurricular‘

activities and leadership roles
in these activities are positively
linked to gettinga ﬁrst job and hav-
ing managerial potential.
Several departments at our
University have expressed the
importance of these activities by
naming them “co-curricula'r;” for
example, students completing a
European Union Studies certiﬁ-
cate must participate in Model
EU, complete an internship, or

do a study abroad program or a
research project. This label ac-
knowledges that many activities
promote important learning and
beneﬁts right alongside the regular

curriculum. They are the impor-

tant connection between life in the
classroom and life in the cubicle.‘

Speaking of connections, it also
helps to-attach a reference or two

to that resumé. An extracurricular ‘
activity can provide an easy way to

interface with other professionals
and names in your chosen career
ﬁeld. If relevant paid work is not
an option, relevant unpaid oppor-
tunities should be a close second.
That’s not to say that-I’m nul-
lifying the importance 'ofpart-time
paid work, but a career-starting
resumé needs to have a clear fo-
cus. A Pitt student who is pursuing
political science-would be better
suited taking part in the affairs of
the Student Government Board
than working at one of the many
computer labs resetting lost login

passwords.
- But if you’re like many students,

to ﬁnd common ground between that work

at a fast—food place, a good tip would be
to emphasize teamwork and a positive at-
titude from that working experience. No
matter what your career aspirations are,
every boss wants to hire someone with good
values, a friendly smile and some work
experience.

College students are in a similar place
to high school students hoping to boost
their college applications by doing a lot of
extracurricular activities. Remember that
regardless of your ﬁnancial situation or
previous work experience, it is important
to emphasize applicable activities to a po-
tential employer. I

connection that might otherwise not exist
between the stratiﬁed groups of individuals
in Pittsburgh, but acts as a constant theme
for Strong.

“In one given night, you could have a per~
formance going on in the Shadow Lounge,
you could have a D] spinning in AVA [with]
people at the bar, and then you could have the
Columbians having a party in the Blue room.
You have three different sets of people passing
each other in the hallway [that connects the
lounges],” he said.

The decision to own

Despite the success of the Shadow Lounge,
both culturally and in regard to business,
Strong decided it was time to. set up shop
somewhere else.

“It was time to renew the lease [in the
fall of 2012], and we decided if we were go-
ing to do it [make the move], to do it now,”
Strong said. “We decided to end the Shadow
Lounge side and keep the AVA and Blue room
going, start on the pathway to owning our
own building.” _

The concept of owning a venue as opposed
to renting one was the major catalyst sparking
Strong’s decision to look elsewhere.

. “Anytime you can own, you’re in a bet-
ter position. You have a vote at the table,”
Strong said.

‘Sami expressed a similar ideology.

“When you own, you have some type of

stake. When you rent, you’re vulnerable,” he
said. Renters, according to Sami, tend to be
vulnerable underneath property owners who
can, and do, raise rent prices. .
“There’s not a lot you can do about [risin
rent prices] except for move forward. That’s
what [Shadow Lounge] is trying to do,” Sami
said. “Part of [the decision to move] is busi-

ness. Part of evolution is survival. How do we
survive?  Business decisions are necessary
for evolution, and owning is paramount to
this evolving, [the combination of] Darwin-
ism and evolution.”

Looking positively into the future and
striving to evolve is exactly what Strong is
doing.

“For us, it’s more of a long-term [decision].
Our reputation is strong. We don’t want to
pay rent 25 years down the line,” Strong said.

Loungers react to the news

According to Strong, regulars of the ,

Shadow Lounge seemed optimistic at the
thought of a new venue. Because Strong plans
to maintain a similar atmosphere at the new
location, he said they feel conﬁdent that the
business will succeed.

“They’ve seen us expand from just one
room with 10 couches and Arizona iced teas 

and blueberry mufﬁns into a multiple-room
venue with a liquor license and national acts
coming in. They kind of expect it. [It’s] the
next stage of development for us,” he said.

But not all longtime affiliates of the Shad-
ow Lounge are as excited about the move as
Strong and Sami. Stovall admitted to feeling
nostalgic and emotional as he spoke about
the early days of the Lounge. He remembered
it as a place that felt “like you were walking
into your friend’s living room.”

V “I don’t think it’s going to be the same,” kg
Stovall said. “I really don’t.” H , ‘
Stovall remembers the times that Strong

would open up the Shadow Lounge on
Thanksgiving and Christmas, and 40 to so
people would come just to “sit around and
talk about their families.”

But Stovall doesn’t only connect this sense
of family with the Shadow L_ounge. Stovall
said he also feels a family—like connection
with Strong, a man who once scouted him

out and strongly supported his art.

“I know that if [Strong] sets up a Shadow

not, I’m going to help him get that place big,”
he said. “He’s one of my best friends, and
he has had my back, so I will deﬁnitely have

the Shadow Lounge does not come the end
of its legacy as a venue that changed a neigh-
borhood and brought people together. In an
attempt to “end it properly,” Strong said, on
March 29 and 30, the Shadow Lounge held a
Legacy Series, a two—day concert, to celebrate
the memories and talent that have passed
through the Lounge over the years. Bands
such as Sonji and Eviction Notice played dur-
ing the event.

“It wasn’t a reunion of old musicians,”
Strong insisted, but rather a celebration of
what was and what is to come.

Even after the Legacy Series, Strong said

he is still “not too emotionally involved” in the A

location’s closing. Instead, he found signiﬁ-

cance,;in_b‘_eingable to deﬁne the end of an era.

I ‘_‘.Ifc*fusuallyjjustkind‘ of fades away [to

where]':when’ tyoufre 50', you ask, ‘What hap-

pened to us?"‘We were able to put an end to
that era and capture it on audio and video.”

In«addition,. Strong will continue the Shad-

ow_Lounge.’s website as an archive featuring_
bits of the Legacy Seriesreleased each month. _

It will act as faiispace for people to upload pic-
tures, videos and stories of the lounge. ‘

With both nostalgia for the past and excite-
ment for the prospects of the future, Strong
hopes to reopen the Shadow Lounge by 2015.
But the time of transition will not constitute a
lull for Strong or music culture in East Liberty.
The Ava Lounge and Blue Room will remain
open and in full force.

So what does this mean for the ﬁxture of

how electronic-infused sound has seeped into

a travesty has never occurred to me while
enjoying Wawa’s fare. V

The strawberry-banana smoothie seemed
virtually identical to Wawa’s, but I have to
rave about Sheetz’s delightfully crispy french
fries — an item completely lacking from
Wawa’s menu. Their toasty goodness graced
my palate in such a way that I was almost
willing to forgive the mistake I could barely
call a hoagie.
L What became apparent to me after tire-
,some hours of rooting through notes and
contemplating the mysteries of what makes

f these chains so awe-inspiring is that there’s a

clear distinction between two styles at work
in this war of the convenience stores.

The ﬁrstis that of the deli-'turned-gas-
station that we call Wawa. The other is
Sheetz’s transformation from gas station
intovfast-food joint. It’s a minute reversal
in life ‘cycles and food styles that is seem-
ingly imperceptibleto the untrained con-
sumer eye. Because of this, I have to wonder
if Sheetz and Wawa supporters will ever be
able to reconcile their differences and come
to the only logical conclusion about their
respective idolized chains: they’re basically
the same thing. I

 Ifyou think you can convince Pat that

Sheetz is better than Wawa, write to him
’at_tpnc_opydesk@gmail.com — but know in

advance that you’re wrong.

Panthers drop th
  againstsouth Florida

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Writer‘

Pitt baseball’s eight-game winning
streak came to an end this week-
end at South Florida, with the Bulls
sweeping the Panthers in Pitt’s

second seriesof Big East action. ~ in  B

All three of the losses could have
turned out in the Panthers’ favor, as
Pitt lost each game of the weekend

' by a single run.

Pitt (20—9,' 3-3 Big East) now

- owns a three—game losing streak

after the weekend’s proceedings, and
the Bulls (18-14, 7-2 Big East) ﬁn-

« ished the series tiedwith Louisville

at the top of the Big East’s standings.
Head coachjoejordano believes

' this weekend revealed a glaring hole
_ in Pitt’s late-game strategy: inexpe-

rience in the bullpen.

“[It was a] very tough weekend,
especially with leads late. But that is
part of the game,” Jordano said in a
statement. “We have to get some of

~ our young arms some experience.
That will be critical atthe end of the

season.”

USF 1, Pitt 0 ,

For only the second time all sea-
son, the high—powered Pitt offense
was shut out by its opposition. The

' pitchers’_duel featured a complete

game from Pitt starter Ethan Mil-
dren (5-2) whose only blemish was
an unearned run allowed in the ﬁrst
inning.

For the Bulls,Jimmy Herget did
Mildren one better by throwing a
complete game shutout and carried a
no—hitter into the sixth inning before
Stephen Vranka singled to start the

» inning. Vranka then got into scoring

position at second with no outs, but
Pitt failed to bring him home.

In the eighth, Vranka tried to
spark the offense with a double off
the Wall in right—center ﬁeld, but the

p Panther rally was once again snuffed

out when Eric Hess lined aball to the

- shortstop, who turned a double play.

USF scored the only run of the
contest when Alex Mendez reached

' base at the expense of an error by

Pitt second baseman Ronald Sucre in
the ﬁrst inning. Back—to—back singles
by James Ramsay and Jimmy Falla
scored Mendez to give Herget the

only run he needed.

Pitt managed to get some of-

the series, putting up six runs on USF

A starter Nick Gonzalez. Pitt struck

ﬁrst Saturday when Vranka blasted
a tvvo-run home run in the third
-inning to score himself and Dylan
Wolsonovich. 4

Wolsonovich scored again in the '

ﬁfth on aUSF throwing error afterhe
doubled with one out. But the Bulls
cut the deﬁcit to one run in the bot-
tom half of the inning, 3-2.

Pitt scored in the seventh, ex-
tending its lead to four runs. Vranka

picked up his third and fourth RBIs
of the day when he doubled to left
and drove in Sucre and Evan Oswald.

Matt Wotherspoon delivered a
quality start, pitching six innings
and allowing just two runs on ﬁve

Savannah King (12) and the Panthers had difficulty hitting the ball against us:-:

Staff Writer '

Coming off a four—game losing streak, the
Pitt softball team (14-20) had hopes of put-
ting an end to its losses when hosting the
University of South Florida this weekend.
Efforts to do so faced signiﬁcant difﬁculty,
however, as the Bulls (32-11) lead’ the Big

East in all pitching categories and occupy

first place in the overall standings. Ulti-
mately, the Bulls won the series in a 3-0

1 sweep of the Panthers.

USF 1o, Pitt 0

Despite the larger crowd in atten-
dance because of Pitt Softball’s Student
Day event, the Panthers fell short in the
series opener.

‘ The Bulls set the tone for‘the game
early, starting off strong in the top of the
first inning. Pitt sophomore pitcher Alexa
Larkin let in three runs right off the bat to
give USF the advantage.

In the third inning, the Bulls scored .

another three runs off Larkin to extend
their lead to six against the Panthers.

With the deﬁcit now doubled, a pitching
change for the home team was in order.
Sophomore pitcher Savannah King entered
in the top of the third.

“I was thinking, ‘Alright, this is my turn.
I got to come in and step it up,”’ King said.

After King came in,she struck out se-

g Pitt trampled by  

nior outﬁelder Stephanie Juergens for the
ﬁnal out of the inning.

Pitt seemed better out in theﬁeld
but couldn’t recoverwhen it was time to

bat with USF pitcher Sara Nevins on the-

mound. The junior pitcher had an intimi-
dating presence and a mean underhand.
Nevins pitched her first no-hitter of the
season on Saturday. The lead grew to 10
after multiple errors made by Pitt in the
top of the seventh.

USF 7, Pitt 1

The Bulls remained the dominant team

in the second game of the series.

The Bulls scored two runs in each of
the first two innings tovtake an early lead
of 4-0. Sophomore Carly Thea scored the
Panthers’ lone run off a hit from freshman
Tori Nirschl in the bottom of the third,
making the contest 4-1. "

‘ USF scored three runs in the top of the

I fourth — one a home run hit by junior _

Stephanie Medina — to make the score 7-1.
Despite this deﬁcit, the Panthers had
a change of momentum, becoming more

aggressive while at bat, and holding their

opponent off for the rest of the contest
by not allowing any more runs. The Bulls
noticed this change in the Pitt squad and

reacted by having Nevins (who pitched a _

no—hitter in the previous game) replace

tirades I’ve ever seen from a coach.

After viewing the tape last November,
athletic director Tim Pernetti suspend-
ed Rice for three games and fined him
$50,000. That was the end of the situation.
Then last week, the tape aired nationally,
causing equally violent uproar from both
the Rutgers and national sports communi-
ties. It took less than 48 hours for Pernetti
to fire Rice and for assistant coachjimmy
Martelli, who was also shown engaging in

0 the offensive “acts in the video, to resign.

It took less thanfive days, for Pernetti to

lose his job, as'’we1l-. ,  -
. I have troubledetermining the most
disturbing partlsof this story: ‘ «
Is it thata Rutgers basketball coach

called players “fairies” and “faggots’_’ only .

three years after a gay Rutgers student
killed himself because his roommate outed
him?- —    if 0

Is it that someone like Pernetti would
remain quiet about his coa_ch’s abusive-

ness inqthe wake of the Penn State scandal, ‘

whereall of America should’ve learned

, it’s better tojust  the right thing when

you’r.e_in a positioiiof power?

Is itthat a college basketball coach can
getaway with physical and verbal abuse
while a player, student or professor would
have been fired and probably arrested on
the-spot for the same actions?

1 Is it that school president Robert Bar-

It wasn’t':§ust in practice thaf.R'ice laid hands on his players’. MCT Campus

chi, entrusted with protecting and caring

for his students, somehow didn’t view the
video until a week ago?

Is it that Rice was ﬁred by Rutgers “not

for cause,” meaning that under contract,

V he is in line to be paid a little more than

$1 million dollars, or 75 percent of his

remaining salary? Or does it bother you
that he will receive a $100,000 bonus for
lasting through the 2012-2013 season?
Despite the damage to so many people’s
reputations, the scandal wasn’t bad for
everyone. Take Auburn University, for ex-
ample: While Rice and his coaching staff

1
were brought to justice by what seems

to be America’s biweekly, temporary and
hyper-national scrutiny (remember when
and for how long we hated LeBronJames?
Tiger Woods? Lance Armstrong? Jerry San-
dusky? Michael Vick?), a story by former

New York Times and Sports Illustrated "‘

writer Selena Roberts about the school
allegedly changing players’ grades fell to
the back pages. The school did so to secure _
eligibility, offering money to potential NFL
draft picks so they would return for their
senior seasons and violating NCAA recruit- 3»
ing rules under former coach Gene Chizik.

According to the Associated Press, Au-
burn athletics directorjayjacobs said in a
statement Thursday that Auburn is review-
ing the report, even though the school has
“no reason to believe these allegations are
either accurate or credible.”

Of course, paying players and changing
grades is nothing new in NCAA football.
Numerous journalistic accounts have cov-
ered similar violations of NCAA rules, and
in some cases -— like Miami — football

programs have been gutted by sanctions ‘-

and penalties as a result. _

Thankfully, the players still will play,
and there are still referees to properly
enforce the rules of the game  right? A

Well, unless they happen to be playing
basketball in the Pac-12, where coordina-
tor of officials Ed Rush has faced accusa-
tions of issuing technical-foul bounties on
Arizona head coach Sean Miller.

According to several ofﬁcials in the Pac-

comparisons to the Fab Five are inevitable.
Yet the only peep we heard from them this
week was when Jalen Rose made a public
plea for Chris Webber to join the other four
at the championship game, reinforcing the
belief that the FabFive still aren’t on great
terms and are so far removed from their
dominant college days they can’t even sit
together at a game. 3
