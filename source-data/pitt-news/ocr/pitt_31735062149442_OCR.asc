president of the American Medical
Association, has deﬁnitely taken a
stand for the AMA against the idea.

versity students and faculty mem-
bers. It has sponsored debates, sym-

timonial” will begin on campus
\Vcdncsday morning, it was an-
nounced today by Emil. Naric,

placed in the Commons Room.

The drive, explains Naric, will be
entirely voluntary, and any contribu-
tions, no matter how large or small,
will be accepted. Beginning Wed-
nesday morning, a large box, in the
shape of a football, will be placed
in the Commons Room, where stu-
dents and faculty may deposit their
contributions. At the same time
volunteers will canvass the Cathedral
and other University buildings, with
miniatures of the central collection
box. .

Solicitation on campus will con-
tinue through Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday of this week. Contribu-
tions will continue to be received
after that time, however, announces
Dr. Jules Labarthe, senior industrial
fellow at Mellon Institute, secretary-
treasurer of the committee. 1

Any surplus funds collected by the
committee above the cost of the “tes-
timonial” will go, according to pres-
ent plans, to the “Dr. John B. Suth-

A pioneer in the relatively new

‘ﬁeld of scientiﬁc social research, Dr.

Elmer introduced the first course in
this subject in 1914 at Fargo col-
lege, North Dakota. At this early

;stage his methods of applying scien-

tiﬁc research were widely questioned
among authorities and were received
with outright disapproval by many
eminent sociologists throughout the
nation. A

Since his early experimental work
Dr. Elmerhas become an'interna-
tional authority in the ﬁeld of sociol-
ogy and his books have been widely
translated.

Registers Drop

After an irregular rise for over a
month, business in the Pittsburgh
district declined slightly last w'eek,
according to the Bureau of Business
Research.

Last week the Bureau’s index of
general business stood at 86.4 per
cent of the 1923-25 average, a de-
crease of four-tenths of a point from
the preceding week.

Business in the district has been
stable since the ﬁrst week in Decem-
ber, when the recovery period which
began early last June was checked.
The index has had a range of four
points in the past 17 weeks.

Industrial production dropped dur-
ing the week, but this loss was bal-
anced by a corresponding increase in
trade activity, the Bureau reported.

0:: Patriotism

(The following editorial is reprinted from a ‘recent

ig:.<;1L:3 of the Carnegie plaid, evening school supplement

"of the Carnegie Tartan. We present it as an excellent
‘editorial, on a vital topic.)

The heroine clinches with the hero for the last
‘time. The liglits come up, then slowly fade. Old

Glory ﬂaps wildly across the silver screen and
everyliody rises and supposedly feels a tug at his
heart‘. How patriotic we are these days.

VVl1ere has this patriotism been for all these past
years‘? It has been years since last we were so ﬂag-
‘conscious. Now we are becoming patriotic again
. . . just, as we did in 1914 and 1915.

Pius XII starts his reign by pleading for peace.
Vibrant as his messag'e is. his words sound puny in
a. world roaring with barrages and gunﬁre. Surelv
and steadily the tides of war are rising and will
continue to rise. They have not reached their crest.

Less than a decade ago college students were
signing resolutions that “they would not ﬁght, no
mat.t.er what. the conditions.” For several months
now they have been voting that they will ﬁght. “if

Soon they will ﬁght for
-a “<".a11se."' Such is the power of propaganda.

Yes, the propaganda presses are rolling again,
even t.hougl: ';:lie_v said that never again could the
.Ame1‘ica11 be fooled the way they were during the
vxar y:’~.:,n's. People l'Tm'get. That ".V01'Cl “atrocities”
llmunnes more and more frequent" in the press.
']‘,h-.x;-o are .»:torie.'~'. of one arn1y’s cruelties to the
v'-;»::‘.en and eliildren of their opponents. Horrible

tale‘; but rrpm-t.cd as gospel. Shades of 1917 and
193:?! ’

"\‘-Kc hate “Hit.ler" just as we hated “the
l*C.-vi.-;cr." ‘We hate “the Nazis" just as we hated

“the llnns." ‘Will we '\V:ll{€‘ up some day and won-
der as we did in the twenties. why we hated and
l{lli.*“l pre}>le who were a lot like ourselves?

l.-C-‘:‘ us challenge sonic of the propaganda that is
lmI'.:-9; éirccl at us. Let us weigli each item in the
l‘.“:‘-.'~.';s c:n‘el'11ll_\' to nzake sure that it sounds plausi-
hi». Wlien the \\'m‘rl “atrocit_v” comes hurtling
out of the izcws, left: look at it carefully and make
F-U‘_‘~.". ‘-:h:‘.:* it. is an 2“-trot-it_v.

l;ct's have our t.:1g a little less wildly, too. Have
p:'opcr respect and reverence for it. of course. But
let ‘:4 h:~.v.a no more of this wild-eyed patriotisin.

it didn‘t turn out so well the last time.

Eiosaor Roll Revival

‘*1

roll had been issued fen‘ two years and suggesting
$.h.a.i: t.ln~ old tradition be revived.

A reply to that editorial. writen by John G.
Quit-.l<, Univei-sit_v regi;tra1', is printed today in our
"In the Mail” eolllnm. lt is an encouraging reply,
3:-rmnising resiunptimi of the honor roll systenl in
the very near future.

We realize. as we said in our previous editorial,
that the Registrar’s office is alreadv overtaxed with"
work. And it therefore follows that the omission
was not a deliberate and premeditated act, but one
forced by circumstances.

Anyway, we ‘'11 be looking forward to that next
honor roll. And. incidentally, Mr. Quick, we prom-
ise not to make any more cracks about your new
registration system——honest.

Your recent editorial concerning
the breaking of a tradition through
the failure of this ofﬁce to prepare
and publish an honor roll was read
with considerable interest.

Although the scholastic honor roll
has not been issued for two years,
you may be sure that this omission

has not been a deliberate act on our
part to deprive the student body of
information in which we think they
have a right to be interested-——despite
the teachings of those who deplore
the measurement of achievement by
letters or numerals. The oﬁice ﬁnds
itself in hearty accord with your con-
clusion that the hard-working stu-
dent is entitled to honorable mention
as frequently as reliable grade facts
can be published. As long as we
have earnest striving toward high
goals, we can expect natural interest
in reports that give publicity to
measures of accomplishment.

The installation of a set of electric
tabulating devices——requiring the use
of registration forms about which the
students have made many jesting re-
marks-—is gradually increasing the
possibility of an extended ofﬁce serv-
ice. For the first years or so, it can-
not be expected that such a_ new sys-
tem will make much of a difference
in the saving of time or eff’-ort. How-
ever, after the period ‘required for
readjustment, a considerable change
can easily be anticipated. Therefore,
by the time for the public:-ition of
the next honor roll, it is conﬁdently
expected that this neglected service
can be revived.

Assuring you of my appreciation
3" your thoughtful editorial, I am,
Sincerely yours,

J. G. QUICK,
Registrar.

Students Sinouial
Show Spirit
Editor, The Pitt News:

Just for a change, I think-someone

should criticize the student body.
There are some elderly gents «in this

country who believe that education

will saveour democracy. That is]
one reason why the government helps
'upport public schools and universi-I
ties. E

They believe that when everybody;
is capable of analyzing political is-’
sues and learns to think for himself,
there can be no fear for the future
of our democracy. Youth "is pro-
gressive they say. Clear thinking
young men interested in affairs that
affect their well—being could never
be led to give up the liberties they
enjoy under our type of government.

That is one of the reasons why we
have student government here at
Pitt. As well as serving the purpose
of giving the students representation
in school affairs, student government
serves to give each of us practical
experience in the democratic proce-
dure of electing representatives.

Well, these elderly gents would
start biting their ﬁngernails were
they to visit Pitt during the general
student elections. “If the students
of our colleges, our schools of higher
learning, have no concern who repre-
sents them, have no respect for the
power of the ballot, what is the use
of all this education?” they would
say. If government is corrupt, or in-
efficient, the blame rests with the
voters. If government is not truly
representative, the blame rests with
the voters.

Ate our schools the answer to this
problem? If the student body ex-
hibits the same gullibility and disin-
terest we are trying to overcome, the
elderly gents had better give up.
Here, we are learning to be repre-
sented by a minority group and to
do nothing about it. And worst of
all, we will all be voting American
citizens in a few years!

Every student who thinks he is
wide—awake and is thankful for the;
educational opportunities he has be-
fore him can make the old gents
very happy by showing that “spirit
of American Youth” that they are
‘praying for.

Sincerely,
DAVID TUCKER. C41.

Out. of I~Iollywood has ﬁnally come a story downright
human and lovable and tender. “l\/lad»: for Each Other”
is all that and much more.

Beginning where most stories end, it follows Jimmy
Stewart and Carole Lombard through the first few years
after marriage. A '

Their worries and troubles and joy become your bur-
dens and happiness. Stewart, a young attorney with a
large law ﬁrm, who visits his irritable, hard of hearing
superior to tell him of his marriage While in Boston on

- the Higgins vs. Higgins case, is greeted with, “There

were over half a million divorces in this country last
year. Congratulations!” ‘

’Wl1en the baby arrives, Jimmy, with the encourage-

ment of Carole, decides to see the boss for a raise in
' salary. He never gets to speak his
piece, for the bossubeats him to the
punch with a 25 per cent cut. Jim-
my goes out on a tear, ashamed of
this supposed inability to be a good
husband.

Things aren’t going well after
Carole comes home from the hos-
pital. Amiable Louise Beavers,
Carole’s servant, offers some meaty
philosophy suggesting, “When you’re
eatin’ Watermelon, you’ve got to
learn to spit out the seeds and spit

Bill Colker

’em out fast, before they spoil the taste of the water-
melon.”

The ﬁlm is so excellent that words here are inade-

quate. There isn’t much plot. How can there be a plot
to a narrative of people who really “live?” Life has no
set pattern. Although the picture necessarily ends, and
on a happy note, you know that Jimmy and Carole, who
remind you of the people next door, will go on quarrel-
ing, loving each other, and having babies and living a
vigorous life It’s that natural. In a world of heartache
and oppression, no better tonic could be found.

Art Cinema . . .

In June, 1936, a group of 25 actors, cameramen, and
technicians left for lonely and remote Foula Island, off
the coast of the mainland of the Shetland, 60 miles from
Scotland. Result of ﬁve months of intense hardship is
“The Edge of the World,” currently showing at the Art
Cinema.

British, Michael Powell, its director, who read an
item in the “London Observer” several years ago about
the evacuation of the last inhabitants from an island,
found the source of a great and impressive story.

He took the saga of a strong, hardy people, faced by
insurmountable natural odds, suffering from inadequate
harvests and a dwindling food supply.

On this rocky island, whose cliffs were pounded by
a raging Atlantic was enacted his theme which embodied
the struggle between those who wanted to stay and those
who wanted to leave the island.

The drama was enacted against the inspiring and im-
pressive natural beauty of Foula, Imagine, for an in-
stance, a cliff that towers into the sky, overhanging the

sea for nearly a quarter of a mile sheer drop, where‘

birds dive down until they become invisible, and waves
are beat into foam around inaczzssible, black rocks thou-
sands of feet be,lo“~-.«v. ‘

Credit is due cameramtzn Ernest Palmer who did
everything from shooting scenes of a rough sea to film-
ing a race up the bare side of 2. steep rocky cliff. At
times, he must have had little more than irnagination
to keep his footing secure.

It is easy to see how the National Board of Review
chose this picture as one of the ten best of 1938. Walter
Winchell, referring to the picture when it was first re-
leased said, “In making it, the Britishers used an instru-
ment that Hollywood should investigate. It is called a
camera.”

A return engagement of “Mayerling” with Charles
Boyer and Danielle Darieux completes the double bill.

Brown Study . . .

By Robert Brown

It is 3:15 in the morning and I
should be in bed.

These columns are a despair to!
everyone concerned in putting out
the paper. I should be much more
conscientious about the whole bus-
iness. I get the linotypers on my
neck; the make—up
men are sore, and
t h e e d i t o r
threatens to can
me if I don’t get
my copy in be-
fore the Friday
night deadline.

I have just ﬁn-
ished one of the
best dance jobs I
have ever played,
and have a subject
to write about. I
shall be very ob-
vious and write about a something
which every student has probably
solved for himself a long time ago.
But there might still be a question in
the minds of some who are worried
because they heartily enjoy both
dance and classical music.

BROIVN VACCILATES

Speaking for myself, I have made
some sort of compromise. I vaccilate.
Sometimes on a job, when the saxcs
are hitting, and our trumpet player,
who is a shy sort of bird except on
a ride chorus, is swinging the whole
crowd on the dance ﬂoor along, I
think that the dance orchestra, a
marvelous example of the economy
of means, is just about tops. _

Then, maybe a week later, we will
have :1 string quartet rehearsal, and
read through some Mozart. Playing
the great harmonies and themes that
are like cold water, limpid in their
purity, I wonder how I ever had the
nerve to think that any dance music
could in any way approach the works
this sick little Austrian turned out.

BROWN HEARS KAYE

It seems to resolve down to the
evident essential that there are
times for everything. Likes everyone
else, I like to get into a stiff shirt
and tux and maneuver around a
dance ‘floor.’ Afterwards, when we
sit. in’Gammons, I do not want to
hear any good music. I want to hear
Sammy Kaye come on the air and
hear his vocalist sing all the stuff
about the moon and June and hearts

Robert Brown

 

and memories, and then I can say all
the silly things I am supposed to say.
But how in the world could I chat-
ter along with Bach posing the great
questions.

It is not a question just between
the so called “highbrow” and ‘‘low
brow.” Last summer, in New York,
I saw the great New York Philhar-
monic in action for the ﬁrst time at
the Lewissohn stadium. They were
playing B1'al1m’s first symphony.
BROWN LIKES CONCERT

All of New York seemed to be rep-
resented, sitting around under the
weak lights on the hard concrete
steps. There were tired housewives
who dragged their hubbies along to
their first concert. There were the
summer students from CCNY who
went without the haircuts they need-
ed that they might hear the best
orchestra in the world. And there
were the girls of New York—beau-
tilul, long legged things in their print
dresses and their absurd little toeless
511095, sitting there very secure in
the knowledge that they represented
everything that was ﬁne and good
in the world to the well dressed
young men who sprawled beside
them.

BROWN GOES TO BED

It was one of the most profound
experiences of my life. Here were
people from all sections and stratas
of the big city listening to Brahms.
Occasionally you could hear the rum-
ble of the 9th Avenue El and shouts
from little boys who were playing
ball in the vacant lot outside the
stadium. And the music rose above
the hum of the city, and yet it rep-
resented all the blood and tears and
ruptures that its people had ever ex-
perienced.

I’m going to bed.

Baskefhall Vriters’ Association, tell about the floor gaine’s latest‘
crick in the neck: _ . _

“Becaiise Mike Novak, six-foot-nine-iiicli center of the unde-
feated Loyola team, has developed to a high degree the art of batting
oppoiient’s shots avrav from the hoop, the rule manipulators are
ti-ving to devise some method of making basketball goal-tending
illegal. _

“Altlioueli the altitudinous Mr. Novak has contributed sonic-

Duquesne, Pitt Face Off

By Bill McE1wa.in

\Yitl1 Diiqiiesne and Pitt as the
combatants, local ice followers to-
night will get their ﬁrst taste this
season of the slap-liappiest scheme
in hockey, the playoffs.

Although the whole hiisiness is
a plan to draw in the shekels, the
best-out-of-three series will give the
Panthers a chance to redeem them-
selves for their failures before the
Dukes during the regular season.

In four previous matches, the
Blufﬁtes were the winners three
times by scores of
3-2, 2-0, and 3-2.
The Pitts took the
other one, 2-1. It
i s p r o b a bl e ,
though not deﬁ-
nite, t h a t the
eventful f o u r t h
game, won by the
Dukes when the
Panthers left the
ice in protest of a
referee’s decision,
will be thrown out
of the ﬁnal league
standings.

To prevent fur-
ther trouble and to stifle all com-
plaints of partisanship, Duquesne
Garden otﬁcials have announced that
the referee and linesman wi.ll be im-
ported «from out of town, the ﬁnal
choices being the two men agreed
upon by rival coaches Mcsorley and
Dietrich.

15 Minute Periods

Vance

Originally suggested for the jobs,
were Pittsburgh Hornets Larry Aurie 
and Happy Emms, but the Dukes sent
up a howl, for reasons not revealed,
and the plan was dropped.

Pitt mentor John Ii/IcSorley has put
in his word favoring Pat Callaghan
and Mike Brophy, the gentlemen who
handle oiﬁciating in the Cleveland
end of the loop, and at present the
idea seems fairly certain of adoption.

Instead of the usual 12 minute
periods, the playoﬁ games will con-
sist of three 15 minute sessions. Both
teams have traveled the longer dis-
tance several times this season in

‘°'  tests, so that the
' time extension
will handicap
neither club.

The Dukes, as
usual, will rely
primarily on tire-
less Bill Vance,
the human hockey
robot. Philo, as
he is popularly
known, personally
scores most of the
Dukes’ goals, sets
up the plays, and
checks back on

Much Traveled Springﬁeid College Exhibition Team
Will Present Gilded Performance Next Thursday

A
V

By Bill Mazefsky

Request performances at New
York ‘s Maclisoii Square Garden;
invitational exhibitions in Havana,
‘(.‘-uba; exhibitions in Canada, and
Mexico. in addition to showings
cverywliere in the United States
have been the itinerary of the inter-
‘nationally famed Springfield Col-
.lege exhibition team which will ap-
pear next Thursday night at the Pitt
Stadium.

The West Point of the physical ed-
iication training ﬁeld, Springﬁeld col-
lege, is represented by this exhibi-
tion team which presents the physical
activity prograni, in so far as is pos-
sible on the restricted area of the
stage. Coached by Professor Leslie
J. Judd, a few men participate in a
necessarily formalized program.
Oermaiin Plans Team

Recognized as the biggest and most
important school of physical educa-
tion in the United States, Springﬁeld
is also famed for its remarkable
‘teaching methods. It combines ordi-
nary athletic instruction with a pro-
gram which emphasizes body rhythm,
power, and beauty instead of routine
brute strength. The four year course
in physical education gives the stu-
dent a background of active varsity
competition, teaching fundamentals,
thorough hygienic background, and
appreciation of body rhythm and
power.

The enrollment is made up of stu-
dents from every part of the country.
The student lists also includes many
Canadians, and citizens of foreign
countries.

The appearance of the Sprinﬁeld
team at the Stadium is due to Karl
Oermann, Pitt physical education in-
structor. A graduate of Springﬁeld,
Oermann was a member of the
Springﬁeld team for three years, and
it was through his efforts that the
team will make its local appearance.

Oermann is interested in organiz-
ing a gym team at Pitt which could

compete with Ohio State, Penn State,
and other schools interested in gym-
nastics. As a means of stimulating
interest
carded the outstanding exponent of
that sport for an exhibition.

The program of the visiting gym-
nasts will consist of an unusual series

in gymnastics, Oermann _

THE BALANCING TRIO

of tableaux in which literally bronzed
athletes take part, the same men
featured prominently several weeks
ago in LIFE Magazine.

Eight men assume the various
poses, making several scenes, inter-
preting the various phases of athletic

life. The poses, which are held for

three minutes, are especially color-
ful because of the unique manner of
makeup, each body being covered
with bronze paint, a mixture of gly-
cerine and aluminum.

The glistening silver bronze ﬂuid,
adds color to the scene, and empha-
sizes the muscle contours, connoting
rhythm and power and grace.
treme care must be used in applying
the ﬂuid because a cut or scratch in-

‘fects rapidly. The paint cannot be

left on for more than an hour. .
Another highlight of the program
is the Cuban Cane Cutters’ Dance.
The team interprets a scene of Cuban
life, and the scene again demands
rhythm and grace.
Clowns On Program
In zicldition to these exhibitions, the

Shortly after the opening whistle,
very shortly after in light of past
games, the high geared line of wings

er, will ﬁll in where needed, and

All precautions will be taken to

prevent an outbreak of the epidemic 5.

of ‘alley brawls which marred the
earlier Pitt-Duquesne ineetir-igs.« ”
Stiff penalties ..will be slapped on
all offenders, a procedure which, if
followed earlier, would probably
have put a stop to the fist ﬁghts and
riots before they could have started.

 

Chariey En , .

While there is no official conﬁrma-
tion whatsoever, it has been report-
ed that Charles, 'W. Bowser will be
recommended for the vacant Pitt
football coaching post to the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees at their
meeting this evening. If approved,
Bowser is expected to take over his
duties at once.

spersed by clowning routines.

All of the group numbers on the
program were created and taught by
Professor Judd with the exception of
the fencing and sabre combat which
was taught by Douglas Boyea, fenc-
ing instructjor, and the baton twirl-
ing which were taiight by William
Wriglit, national baton title holder
and director of the College band.

Approximately one-half of the
alumni are serving in institutions of
public education, including colleges
and universities, state teachers col-
leges and normal schools, high and
elementary sc‘iools_. private schools
and academics, parks, playgrounds,
and recreation. centers.

Springﬁeld is represented by four-
teen varsity sports, and no undue
emphasis is laid on any phase or ath-
letic activity. Basketball and volley-
ball were both invented and ﬁrst
played at Springﬁeld.

Founded in 1887 Springﬁeld col-
lege has for 52 years been the mecca
of would-be physical educators.

weather, Ralph Mitterling and his
baseball candidates continue their
workouts in the cramped, poorly-
lighted indoor quarters beneath the
south end of the stadium.

The switch to the outdoor setting
would be welcomed both by Mitter-
ling and his boys. Pitchers have
been unable to let out to any extent,
and inﬁelders have been forced to
limit their activities to tossing a ball
around and loosening their muscles.

In addition, freshman practice
will not begin until the team gets out
or doors. The fresh not only have
games deﬁnitely scheduled but ar-
rangments are being made to provide
a more extensive schedule.

Two of the four home games for
the Panther varsity, those against
Penn State on May 11 and 12, will be
features of Spring Festival week.
The Sports Jamboree, a special Fes-
tival high light, will precede one of
the Panther-Lion games.

Coss Explains Construction Work
In New Gymnasium for Women

._

By Virginia Worek

The women’s gym recently com-
pleted in the University, is the only
one of its kind in Pittsburgh, accord-
ing to Raymond L. Coss, superin-
tendent of buildings and grounds.

The ﬂoor of the gym, an innova-
tion in this district, is made of 1am-
inated ﬁr. It is the only type of wood
floor guaranteed to remain in a satis-
factory condition in a basement, after
a length of time. It is less susceptible
to warping, twisting, or corrugating
from moisture caused by broken seals
in the water—proofing according to
Mr. Coss.

A concrete ﬂoor was ﬁrst laid, and
then covered with layers of tar-paper
coated with emulsiﬁed asphalt to
make it water—proof. After this wa-
ter-proofing was applied, modern
“sleepers,” strips of wood were laid
down, to which the ﬂooring was then
nailed.

He also states that in case of ex-
pansion from moisture, a space of
one and one-half inches has been left
between the walls and ﬂoor, and steel
angles have been placed over the
space as a safety measure. In or-
der that the floor and basement
might have the same amount of
moisture, to eliminate any later in-
crease or decrease iii the percentage
of moisture, the wood for the ﬂoor
was stored in the basement of the
Cathedral for a month before it was
installed. _

Other unusual features are incor-
porated in the walls, the ceiling, and
the lights, according to Mr. Coss.
The walls are made of ceramic tile.
The ceiling is made of acoustical tile,
which is soft, and deadens sound by
breaking up reverberations and ab-

On Campus

Second Discussion *

On Good Manners

f you saw one of the University
faculty members on campus, would
you greet him with, “Hi, Prof?”
Does a gentleman always walk
between two ladies?

These are some of the everyday
problems in manners which are
discussed and answered at the
Manners Forum of Men’s Council
held on Wednesdays at 2:30 o’clock
in 208 Cathedral.

Is it good manners to break a
rule of etiquette rather than to
hurt another’s feelings? Does a
good conversationalist repeatedly
comment, “Is that so?”

Situations which all men stu-
dents face at some time nearly
every day are explained and
analyzed in an attempt to save
students the embarrassment which
results from not knowing how to
act.

The forum, headed by Richard
Rowes, C41, is entitled “What
Every Man Should Know.” The
work accomplished at the weekly
meetings is directed along the line
of outlining proper manners for a
gentleman.

Miss Ewart Marries

Mr. and Mrs. H. E. Ewart of 705
Virginia avenue extension, Aspin-
wall, have announced the marriage
of their daughter, Jean, Ed41, to
Frank Smith, BA39, son of Mr. and
Mrs. C. W. Smith of 5857 Ellsworth

sorbing sound waves. The lights pre-
vent direct glare, Mr. Coss says, by
the use of louvres, metal coverings
which break up the rays of light.

The ﬂoors in the washrooms,
locker and shower rooms are also
unique in that they are made of
“Hubbellite.” Named after Dean S.
Hubbell, an industrial fellow of the
Mellon Institute, who developed it,
“Hubbellite” is a ﬂoor with disinfect-
ing qualities. Research work in its
qualities was done by Dr. William H.
Emig, associate professor of biology
at the University.

The ﬂoor is composed‘ of magne- 3

sium oxichloride cement, to which

THE PITT NEWS

  Determine New iPitt Rifles to View Demonstration

New Garand

By Robert D. Hamilton

Pitt Riﬂes, honorary military fra-
ternity, will hold its ﬁrst forum this
on Wednesday, at 12:30
o’clock in 24 Cathedral.

Through the courtesy of the War
department and Major Clyde Mor-
gan, head of the Pittsburgh Ordi-
nance District, the group has been
able to secure one of the famed new
Garand riﬂes, which place the U. S.
Army 13 years ahead of the other
armies of the world.

W. A. Mortenson, civilian inspector
for the Pittsburgh ordinance office,

‘will demonstrate the riﬂe.

Issued only six months ago, there
are only about ten thousand of the
riﬂes in existence today, and it will
be several years before the entire
army can be supplied with them.

The riﬂe is operated by gas from
its own cartridges, given off when
the powder explodes. This gas makes
the riﬂe a semi-automatic or auto-
loading riﬂe. That is, it throws out
the empty shell, puts in a live cart-
ridge, and cocks the riﬂe for the next
shot. The riﬂeman has only to keep
squeezing the trigger.

Although the magazine holds but
eight shots, the weapon is capable of
a volume of ﬁre of ﬁfty to sixty
shots per minute, making each
doughboy a walking machine-gun
nest, and placing our army far in
advance of foreign armies with man-
ually operated riﬂes.

Admission is free to all students
interested.

¢Y' Mental Wizards’
Defeat: Tech Men

Inspired by a cheering section of
University students and a large
studio audience, the YMCA “ment-
al wizards” defeated the Carnegie
Institute of Technology YMCA in
a “Radio Mystery Quiz” broadcast
over WWSW last Thursday even-
ing from the downtown YMCA.

This is the second successive
“mental victory” for the Univer-
sity. Last fall a News team de-
feated a team of Tech domestic
science coeds in a similar quiz-
broadcast.

Two Mixed Squads ;
Argue Alliance Question;

In the first e.\'tcnsion (liscussion
of its kind, two mixed teams from
the Mcn‘s and \\'on1e11’s Debating‘
Associations will argue the ques-
tion of a. possible A11glo—A1nerican
alliance before the Men’s Club at
the Beth Shalom synagogue in Squir- i
rel Hill tonight at 8 o’clock.

Helen Lubit, Ed40, and Abe W010-
vitz, C40, will support the alliance.
Freda Jaﬂe, C41, and Saul Dizenfeld,
C39, will defend the negative side of
the question.

A previous experiment of mixed
team debating was held at Inquiry
Forum several weeks ago, when Lor-
raine Simpson, C39, and Wolovitz
opposed Miss J aife and Edward
Springer, C39, on the same question.

The two teams will clash over the
proposition, “Resolved, that the Unit-
ed States should establish an alliance
with Great Britain.” This question
has been adopted by the Pennsylva-
nia Forensic league as the season’s
high school topic.

According to Roy H. Umble, men’s
director, and Miss Charlotte Mac-
Murray, women’s director, this type
of combined work in extension de-
bating helps to bring the two groups
into closer cooperation for mutual
help.
