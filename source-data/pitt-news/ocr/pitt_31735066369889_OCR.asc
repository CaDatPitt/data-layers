Nuclear
Energy

Harmless?
By MARTY WILLIS

The American public is “very
badly misinformed” about the risks
of nuclear power, according to Ber-
nard L. Cohen, professor of physics
at Pitt. Speaking Wednesday at the
University Honors Program Noon-
time Lecture Series. Cohen present-
ed his case for nuclear power. He
He cited unbalanced media coverage
of the issue as being responsible for
creating a political situation in
which “the public is so highly over-
sensitized against nuclear power
(‘ring-wss»"ncn  ‘.‘>.’t:r-.'v;’;.Z;
points for opposing it."

Cohen listed five distinct prob-
lems in the American public’s under-
standing of nuclear power. They are
a wildly exaggerated fear of radia-
tion, a distorted view of the risks of
accidents, such as reactor melt-
downs, a general failure to under-
stand and quantify the concept of
risk in society, grossly unjustified
fears about the disposal of radioac-
tive waste and a romantic idea that
solar energy can or should replace
coal or nuclear energy.

“The public has been driven
insane over fear of radiation, and I
use that word meaningfully, because
insanity means you've lost contact
with reality...that’s an apt descrip-
tion. The public’s concept of the
dangers of radiation has no contact
with reality,” Cohen said.

What Does The Government Know ?

By rooo ERKEL

The personal information files
kept by the U.S. goverment are
sometimes so extensive that an ex-
Pitt student‘s file contained clip-
pings from The Pitt News pertaining
to his involvment in extracurricular
and social activities.

The student -— deemed an “acti-
vist” in his day — is just one of the
many people who have requested
information being kept by the fed-

eral government under the rights
and protection of the Freedom of
Information Act and the Privacy
Act. Jim Lieber, director of the
Pittsburgh chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, served as the
student’s attorney in his attempt to
find out what the goverment knew
about him.

Lieber spoke yesterday on the cur-
rent status of those two acts at The
Pitt Forum for Social Responsibil-
ity and Social Values lecture. The

image and information the Ameri-
can public has on both the Freedom
of Information and Privacy Acts, as
well as their perception of the
ACLU, is limited, according to
Lieber.

“These acts are not just theoretical
support for the first amendment,“
Lieber said. “They are not intended
soley for use by [Bob] Woodward-
and [Carl] Bernstein-types and a few
other journalists.”

SGB Loses
Recognition
Power

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The Student Activities office is
working on implementing the new
certification policy for registering
and recognizing student organiza-
tions adopted last winter.

The biggest change from the past
policy is that the university, instead
of the Student Government Board
(SGB), will now recognize student
organizations.

According to assistant director of
student activities Terrence. Milani,
the student goverment organiza-
tions will still deierrnine which
groups are eligible for funding and
how much they will receive.

' “The groups will have the oppor-
tunity to apply for funds as they do
now," Milani said. “The allocation
process will remain the same."

The deans of various schools that
have academic recognized groups
are to hand in a list of those organi-
zations to the university, and extra-
curricular recognized groups must
register with the vice-chancellor of
student affairs by the first of the
year.

“We made one consistent univer-
sity policy to apply throughout the
school,” Milani said.

There is really no major shift of
power in the recognition process,
according to SGB president Mark
Downs.

“if a student group wants to form
or be recognized, it has to go
through the Student Activities

Office,” Downs said. “Student

Diagnostic Technique Hits Medical Field

By TIMOTHY M. HUNTER

Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), a technique that has been
used by chemists and physicists for
the past few decades, has become of
interest to the medical field as a new
diagnostic technique.

Unlike X-rays and CT scanners,
the NMR can produce images with-
out the use of potentially harmful
radiation. It also does not use pain-
ful injections or bulky electrodes.
The NM R exposes the body to mag-
netic and radio-frequency fields and
extracts the necessary biochemical
information. This information is
then sent to a computer, which dis-
plays it as a highly detailed diagnos-
tic image.The images are much
more clearly defined than those pro-
duced by X-rays or CT scanners.

Although the basic principles of
how the NMR works are well under-
stood, the clinical applications are
still in their preliminary stages.
Much research is necessary for their
development in this area.

The University Health Center,
Pitt, and Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity are presently establishing the

NMR Research and Development
institute of Pittsburgh.

“Pittsburgh is a natural resource
in terms of NMR talent that is
unmatched anywhere else in the
country,” said,Joel Etiinger,.execu-
tive vice-president of the Health
Center. “With the expertise of Pitt,
CMU, and the hosptials in the
region, it is hoped that Pittsburgh
will become one of the premier, if
not the premier. development site in
the country."

The diagnostic procedure will
benefit the 3,700 full-time students
enrolled within the six schools ofthe
health sciences. Non-health-related
fields, such as chemistry, computer
science, biology, and physics, will
also feel the effects.

Professor l..i. Lowe, head of the
NMR group at Pitt, said,“NMR is
an exciting tool for biology and
medical fields... and an excellent
area for the training of students.
They have great number of oppor-
tunities waiting for them after
graduation.”

Lowe's lab presently has a home-
made NMR spectrometer that can

be converted to make images from
small animals such as rats. Once this

i NMR is completely converted, it

will be used in research and training.
Lowe is working with CMU in a
joint venture to develop a Pitts-
burgh NMR facility. He will give a
talk ‘on NMR in the near future.
The NMR has yet to be approved
by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) for use in non-research
clinical areas. Safety is not the fac-

tor that is holding up the approval,
though; the FDA is trying to find
the best technique for producing the
images.

The estimated cost of one NMR,
for use on humans, ranges from
$5.36 million to $6.6l million. The
cost for two NMRs at one site
ranges from $7.24 million to $8.49
million. These costs include facility
construction, equipment acquisi-
tion and installment and operating

 

I m a g e s w e r e obtained with the mag netlc resonance systems

cerned, both the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA)
and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield
Association are considering cover-
age of the diagnostic procedures.
Many feel the NMR will soon
become the most useful thing since
the X-ray machine. The Pittsburgh
facility has the potential to play a
major role in the development of the
NMR in the near future. ‘

Computer Literacy: An Issue]-‘or The ’80s

By JOHN HOUSTON

Computers have recently become
a large part of Americans’ lives.
Home computers, once a luxury, are
now quite common in homes around
the country. The media, computer
companies and many others say that
the computer will take over our
society. This raises two questions:
How important will it be to be com-
puter literate? And is computer liter-
acy necessary for the college
graduate to be effective in the job
market?

James Williams, a professor in
Library and Information Sciences
(LIS), said the advent of the micro-
computer was a big step in the com-
puter field.

“Before, everyone had to go
through a central department to use
a computer, but now data can be
entered and exited at one source,
which now is at hand," Williams
said.

Because of the microcomputer,
Williams said he feels that compu-
ters will become commonplace, and
all people will have to learn to deal
with them.

“Computers can only be fully util-
ized when people understand them,
so people will at least have to know
how to use them at at least the sys-
tem level,” Williams said. That level
being the entry and the collection of
data.

Williams also said computers are
becoming more powerful and
simpler and in the future, it will be
much easier to reach a level of com-
puter literacy.

“Everybody’s course load in LIS
is at least 60 percent computer-
based,” Williams said. “In the
future, everybody will have a termi-
nal at his desk.”

Carmel McShane, a senior at Pitt,
said she thinks it is very important to
be computer literate.

“It is not important whether or

‘not a person after graduation will be

working at ajob where he comes in
contact with computers," McShane
said. “Because sooner or later, that
person will have to deal with compu-
ters. People who are not computer
literate will, at some point, have to
learn to use a computer, or that per-
son will not be effective at his job.”

McShane agreed with Williams
by saying that as computers become
more advanced, they will be easier to
work with and it will eventually
come to the point where everyone,
regardless of his. line of work, will
have a computer'at his desk.

Alec Stewart, director of the Uni-
versity Honors Program, has a more
reserved attitude toward the role of
the computer.

“I think there is no question that
computers are an essential aspect of

Fulbright
Applications
Available

The 1984-85 competition for
grants for graduate study abroad
offered under the Fulbright Pro-
gram and by foreign governments,
universities and private donors will
close on Oct. 15, I983.

Applicants must be U.S. citizens
at the time of application, and must
generally hold a bachelor's degree or
its equivalent before the beginning
date of the grant, and in most cases,
should be proficient in the language
of the host country. Except for cer-
tain specific awards, candidates may
not hold a Ph.D at the time of
application.

Application forms and further
information for students currently
enrolled at the University of Pitts-
burgh may be obtained from the
Fulbright Program Adviser, Angi
Yucas, whose office is located in the
University Center for International
Studies, 4Gl2 Forbes Quadrangle,
624-3364. The deadline for filing
applications at Pitt is Oct. 165, I983.

the last quarter of the twentieth cen-
tury,” he said. “But, the university
should not become a computer
tech.”

S‘tewart agreed that future
workers will have to get used to
using a computer in their field and
said students who do not understand
the workings ofa computer will be at
a definite disadvantage to those who
do.

“The computer will be a common
place. but those who do not wish to b . - , ,
use them should not be forced into a  I V '  , _ _
position of having to do so," Stewart
said.

Finally, Stewart said since the
number of students who have com-
puter exposure in high school is
increasing, it is desirable for the stu-
dents to be familiar with computers
before coming to college.

Dr. Siegfried Treu, ofthe compu-
ter science department, said the
computer is highly desirable, “if not
necessary,” and emphasized “that
computer literacy is important.”

“It is not realistic to try to retrain
people already in the job market to
use computers," he said. “It should
be a requirement in or before high
school that students get exposure to
computers.”

But Treu is quick to point out that
people will not be able to live with-
out computers in the future and said
the media has built up the need for
the computer.

“In the future, modern offices
will, instead of typewriter, have ter-
minals," he said. “It will be the role
of the specialist to design systems
that almost anyone can use.“

\

Being  
Responsible

r'“Think...Before You Drink” is an ad slogan that has
been adopted by the Student Health Services, the
Health Education Office and the Office of Residence
Life (ORL) as part of Pitt’s fight against student
drinking. _

While The Pitt News does not support ORL’s new
alcohol policy, it is a good thing that these offices are
encouraging students to be responsible in their drink-
ing habits.

Drinking among the nation’s young has been on the
minds of many legislators, parentsiand concerned citi-
zens. Rep. James F1orio(D-N.J.) has introduced legis-
lation in the House of Representatives to set the
national drinking age at 21 to cut drunken-driving
fatalities.

Florio said statistics show that since some states
lowered the drinking age during the 1970s, there has
been a rise in accidents involving young people and
alcohol. On the other hand, states that have a drinking
age of 21 have had a drop in fatal accidents.

Florio and groups such as Mothers Against
Drunken Driving (MADD) attribute this directly to
the decline in the number of people under 21 drinking.

Having a national drinking age of 21 is a good idea
and will probably lower the number of accident fatali-
ties considerably.

Many youths who live in states where the drinking
age is 21 travel to nearby states, where the drinkingage
is lower, and stock up on beer and liquor. Merchants

who run the liquor stores in states such as West Virgin-
ia and Ohio often overlook the Pennsylvania drivers’
licenses and the age of the customers and serve them

‘ anyway.

These merchants may unknowingly be contributing
to the deaths or critical injuries of these people, who
may be involved in accidents while travelling back to
their home states. ‘ '

Having a uniform drinking age of 21 would alleviate
this problem and wou1d.save lives. Drinkers who are
21 are supposed to be responsible drinkers. They are
older, more mature and should be more aware of the
effects of drinking than their younger counterparts.

Although the efforts of the nation’s leaders and
groups such as MADD are commendable, the odds of
their working are low. States that currently have a
drinking age of 18 or 19 will fight this legislation
because it would be bad for the liquor business in their
states. ' E -

Also,‘if the legislation is passed, those under 21 will
still continue to drink and drive, even though it would
be illegal. Pennsylvania’s drinking age is 21 and that
doesn’t stop those under age from drinking. There’s
always an older friend or sibling to walk to the corner
bar or state store to purchase alcohol for them.

There needs to be more education in high schools,
junior high schools and even grade schools about the
effects of alcohol and the consequences of drinking
and driving. If America’s youths are taught early in life
about the hazards, maybe they will be smarter than
today’s drinkers.

U.S. Ignoring Some Barbarism

Dear Editor:

The unceasing outcry over the
South. Korean passenger plane
which was shot down by Soviet figh-
ter planes has exposed the relative
ease with which many of us are able
to succumb to anti—communist hys-
teria, permitting us to aggressively
denounce the Soviet Union as “bar-
barous” and “uncivilized” while
ignoring or glossing over the barbar-
ity of nations which we economi-
cally, militarily° and ideologically
support.

A strong example is provided by
our relationship with Israel, a nation
which continues to receive economic
and military aid regardless of the

severity or uncivilized nature of their ‘

actions. Military aid to Israel. con-
tinues- uninterrupted following the
horrible devastation of Beirut,
which resulted in the death of thou-
sands of Palestinian and Lebanese
people. Economic aid continues to
flow into Israel, while it openly uses
this aid to perpetuate its policy of
creeping annexation (“creating
facts") on the West Bank, with dis-
possession and dispersal being the
consequences for the Palestinian
population.

But there is a further example of
Israeli aggression and barbarism,”
one which has a direct bearing upon
the present situation of the downed
Korean airliner. In February of
I973, Israeli fighter planes shot
down a Libyan passanger plane over
occupied Egyptian territory (the
Sinai peninsula), resulting in the
death of 108 people. The defense
minister, Moshe Dayan, said that
the plane had passed over a “highly
sensitive” military area in a manner

which had “aroused suspicion.” He
also claimed that before the plane
was shot down the Israeli jets had
repeatedly attempted to warn the
aircraft but were unable to make
contact with the Libyan plane.
These statements sound strikingly
similar to those which Soviet offi-
cials have offered in explanation for
their shooting down of the South
Korean passenger plane. The plane
had entered Soviet airspace, passed
over strategic ‘bases on both the
Kamchatka Peninsulaand Sakhalin

ica, Africa and the Middle East that

we are only concerned with human
rights abuse when the Soviet Union
is involved and specifically when
U.S. citizens are killed. We have also
proven how thoroughly we agree
with the Israelis that Palestinian,
Lebanese and Libyan people are

entitled to the same rights as U.S. or
Korean citizens and that it. is per-

Make A Child Happy

Dear Editor:

What is the spirit of Christ-
mas? The spirit of Christmas. is
the joy of giving, the happiness in
a child’s eyes and the beaming
smile as they open gifts on
Christmas morning.

The Marine Corps Reserves
had that in mind when they
began the Toys for Tots Drive in
1947. Since that time, over 50
million toys have been collected
for over 20 million underprivi-
leged children. It is a wonderful
feeling when a parent of a needy
child tells you about the happi-
ness on Christmas morning. It is
a special moment when you see a
needy child smile with delight
after receiving a toy from some
caring person. It is also gratify-
ing to know you aided a good
cause.

I am proud to serve my coun-
try in the United States Marine
Reserves, and believe in the Toys
for Tots Drive. For the past two
years, I have participated by col-
lecting toys. Each year, my cam-

paign has grown and increased in
the number of donations. My
goal is to make all the under-
priveleged children happy at
Christmas. I enjoy the work,
time and effort I put into my
campaigns.

This year, I am beginning my
collecting on October 1, 1983. If
you or anyone you know of can
help me reach my goal, let me
know. I am asking the University
of Pittsburgh campus popula-
tion to help. If anyone has a
younger brother or sister who no
longer uses a toy, there is a child
somewhere who would give any-
thing to play with it. Toys should
be in good condition.

If you have any questions or
can help, contact John DiDome—
nico at 327-7479 after 6 p.m.
Help make an underpriviledged
child have a Merry Christmas,
donate to the Toys for Tots.

Animal Rights Editorial
Left outlmportant Facts

Dear Editor:

Your opinion on animal rights
left outsome important facts.
The dogs that were supposed to
be shot by the defense depart-
ment had already been con-
demned to death by the lack of
care of their owners. They were
going to be provided by public
pounds who were planning to kill
the animals anyway. The dogs
would have been anesthetized
before being shot and then used
to train military doctors in the
treatment of gunshot wounds.
So because of the furor of

“animal rights” activists, these
animals died uselessly rather
than providing an important
benefit in medical training. Rea-
sonable people don’t like to see
animals suffer needlessly. But all
too often, animal rights activists
are uninformed about the
methods and goals of animal
research, preferring to get emo-
tional rather than learn the facts.

Richard Goldschmidt
Ph. D.

The following information has
been excerpted from an ACLU
handbook, “The Rights of
Aliens,” by David Carliner.

Q: Who are naturalized citizens?

A: They are persons, born as
aliens, who acquire citizenship
after birth under laws enacted by
Congress. The present naturali-
zation statute requires a period
of residence in the U.S., gener-
ally 3 years for spouses ofAmeri-
can citizens and 5 years for other
persons, proof of good moral
character, attachment to the
principles of the Constitution 1
and the ability to read,write and
speak the English language.

Q: Which persons born out-
side the U. S. are citizens at birth?

A: Under present law, a person
born outside the U.S. is a citizen
at birth if:

0Both_parents are citizens and

now has previously resided in the
U.S.;

0One parent is a citizen and
the other is a national of the
U.S., provided that the citizen
parent has previously been pres-
ent in the U.S. continously for 1
year;

0One parent is a citizen and
the other is an alien, provided
that the citizen parent has been
present in the U.S. for a period of
IO years, of which 5 mush have
been after the age of l4;

0The parents are unknown
and the child is “found" in the
U.S. before he is 5 years old,
unless, before he reaches the age
of 21, the child is shown to have
been born outside the U.S.

Q: Does the Immigration and
Naturalization Service have the
right to deport an alien without a
hearing?

A: No, not in most cases.

However, an alien who has
been admitted to the U.S. as a
crgwman on a conditional land-
9.5 permit may be deported upon
a summary revocation of his per-
mit without a hearing, as may

Rights Of Aliens Discussed

aliens who have deserted from
foreign armed forces while in the
U.S. where treaties authorize
summary removal from foreign
armed forces while in the U.S.
where treaties authorize sum-
mary removal from this country.
Certain aliens who have been
previously deported but who
have reentered the U.S. illegally
may also deported without a
hearing.

Q: Does a deportable alien have
any voice in determining the
country to which he is to be
deported?

A: Yes, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has the
power to require the deportation
of an alien‘ to the country of his
citizenship, birth or last resi-
dence, but the alien first has the
opportunity to designate a coun-
try of his own choice.

An alien also has the right to
request a stay of deportation
to any country in which he would

Ignorant Of Mathematics

Dear Editor:

The article by John Gambescia of
September l4 leads to one of two
conclusions: 1) Gambescia did not
have his facts straight, or 2) Gam-
bescia is ignorant of the most basic
principles of mathematics. Unfortu-
nately, we are led to believe the
latter.

Gambescia claims that the
increase in price of the season foot-
ball ticket has not drastically
affected sales. However, by simply

He explained that everyone is
struck by some 15,000 particles of
radiation per second from natural
sources, but that “the probability for
a particle of radiation to cause
cancer or genetic effects is very, very
small — one particle in every 30
quadrillion.

“If all of the electricity used in the
United States were generated by
nuclear power, the radiation emitted
would probably lead to six or seven
additional cases of cancer per year
for the entire nation,” Cohen said. In
terms of the risk of death for each
individual, this is equivalent to
crossing one more street per year or
taking one puff of a cigarette per
year, he said.

Regarding the risk of a reactor
meltdown, Cohen stressed that
“there has never been one.” While

the media presents the image of a
meltdown “laying waste an area the
size of Pennsylvania“ and leaving
masses of dead bodies, Cohen
asserted that this portrayal has no
scientiﬁc validity.

“All reports agree that even if
there had been a meltdown at Three
Mile Island, there wouldn’t have
been any significant health effects.
The conclusion, then, is that Three
Mile Island was not a close call on
disaster. As far as I can tell, the
media continually project the idea
that it was a close call,” Cohen said.

Cohen has published several arti-
cles in professional and popular
journals on the subject of risk. He
shared with Wednesday’s audience a
summation of his research, bringing
to bear a wide variety of statistics
and interpretation.

He concluded that “the real risks
in the world are being poor, being
uneducated, smoking, working at
certain jobs, and so forth,” not the
small risk of death or illness posed
by nuclear power plants.

Solar power is not the answer to
our energy needs, Cohen said. This
is due to formidable problems of
cost, geographic and seasonal com-
plications, land use and availability
—— plus increased health risks to
plant workers, according to Cohen.

Several sensational quotations
have been attributed to this man
over the last few years, and Cohen
confirmed that he had made state-
ments such as “I would inhale 1,000
times as'much plutonium as Ralph
Nader says will kill you" and “I
would eat as much plutonium as
Ralph Nader will eat caffeine.”

There are now about 90 groups
recognized by the student govern-
ments, according to Milani, and the
first phase of implementation ofthe
new policy will be to register groups
with the university.

In addition to student organiza-
tions‘ being recognized by the uni-
versity, there is now the option for
small student groups to register
within the university system.

Recognized groups are part of the
university, but registered groups can
be private affiliations that exist
internally. A small group of students
can get together and form a club and
have it registered, as long as it meets
the university criteria.

Milani said this new policy will
not hurt any existing recognized
groups — the requirements for

influence. There will be standard
privileges afforded to registered
organizations. “ I

“When we put things into writing,

Galway Kinnell Reads

By MARK MARTINI"

Pitt‘s Visiting Mellon Profes-

sor and Puliter Prize-winning

’ poet Galway Kinnell responded
with characteristic stoicism that
“I felt OK” about reading at the
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium on
Wednesday night. He also said
that he felt the capacity audience
was “listening, knowledgeable.
responsive, and you need those
qualities to read well.”

Kinnell recited mostly from
memory for the 70-minute read-
ing, though he did borrow his

book, “Mortal Acts, Mortal

__ Words,” from a member of the

audience to read “Goodbye,” a

poen addressing the death of his
mother and the students of one
of his classes that he taught here
in the ‘70s.

Kinnell followed “Goodbye"
with related readings of James
Wright’s “Youth” and Patrick
Cavanaugh’s “In Memory of My
Mother.” Other selections
included “First Song,” “The
Bear,” “St. Francis and the
Sow,” “Rainbow,” “Daybreak,”
“The Apple Tree,” “The Funda-

mental Project of Technology,”
and “Wait” and “After Making

I Love We Hear Footsteps," the
two poems reproduced in the
September 9th edition of The
Pitt News. The reading was fol-
lowed by a reception for Kinnell
at Zelda's Greenhouse.

The Pitt News, Friday, September 16, 1983

continued from page 0"‘?

One of Lieber’s current clients -—
a professor at one of Pennsylvania's
state universities —— has been denied
access to personal information
which the federal goverment is keep-
ing on him. The rights provided
under the Privacy Act have been
denied the professor because of his
membership in the Communist
party, according to Lieber.

Lieber pointed out that informa-
tion obtained through FOIA and
Privacy Act requests can serve more
of a practical purpose also. The
recall of the Firestone Company’s
500 Series tires followed after a
request for information being held
by the National Highway and Traf-
fic Safety Administration, accord-
ing to Lieber. He also pointed out
that information obtained from the
Food and Drug Administration
labelled over 600 prescription drugs
as ineffective, thereby prohibiting
payment for those drugs under Med-
icare and Medicaid Insurance.

The FOIA, passed by Congress in
1966 and amended in 1974, covers
only the legislative branch of the fed-
eral government. Congressional and
judicial information cannot be
retrieved through FOIA and Pri-
vacy Act requests, and all states have
separate laws concerning access to
information.

what The Government Knows

“The Freedom of Information
Act is not a complete can opener,
Lieber said. He also said that
exemptions to botli acts are con-
stantly being gencrated by the
courts, particularly under the Rea-
gan Administration. A new trend‘ -
counter Freedom of Inf01'maU0n
requests —— has also complicated the
legal question of information, a
problem Lieber said the originators
of the laws never forsaw.

Lieber said that many groups and
individuals make requests for infor-
mation under the acts including rela-
tives of POWs and those still listed
as missing in action from the Viet-
nam War. The governmental agen-
cies handling the request can charge
for both search time, at the rate of
$3.50 an hour, and for copying costs
— l0 cents a page. Because of these
costs, Leiber warns that those
requesting information should be
able to “reasonably describe” the
materials they are seeking. Other-
wise, thousands of pages of informa-
tion and their accompanying costs
may come as a surprise.

In the past, waivers ofthe fees had
been relatively easy to obtain, but
under current administration guide-
lines, a ﬁve—part needs test must first
be passed.

The irony, as some at the lecture
saw it, in the acts is that if someone
requests information and none

By LINDA HENRY

Why would a working New York
actor come to Pittsburgh to spread
his wings _instead of the other way
around? First of all, the practice is not
so unusual these days with Broadway
producers hesitant to take chances
with _any but proven names, and
secondly, regional theatres in places
like Pittsburgh are growing steadily
in both number and quality. Specifi-
cally, for New York actor Dan South-
ern, Pittsburgh has proven to be a
broadening experience.

Southern answered a newspaper
ad to audition for the Three Rivers

Shakespeare Festival and was cast in ~

three of this past season's juiciest
roles. He quickly became the darling
of the festival when Henry IV, Part I
opened; he received rave reviews as
the willful and passionate Hotspur.
Southern had played the character
before in a production done by the
Riverside Shakespeare Company in
New York, of which he is a founding
member. ”Of the roles [I did this
summer], Hotspur is my favorite
because I feel he's the most like me,”
Southern says.

Southern is disciplined with the
right amount of confidence to thrive
and survive a life in the theatre. He is
physically stunning, with a strong
dancer's body on a 6-4 frame. He has

Momix:D

By LINDA HENRY

The Pittsburgh Dance Council
opened its ”New Perspectives on
Dance” series at the Pittsburgh Play-
house Theatre last weekend with a
unique dance company known as
Momix.

Momix, originally, was the title of a
dance choreographed by Moses Pen-
dleton, a co—founder of the Pilobulus
Dance Theatre based in Connecticut.
Pendleton still does his Momix dance
on occasion with the Pilobulus group,
but now it has become the signature
dance for his own company, spun off
from Pilobulus in 1980.

On Saturday, Pendleton was with
his doctor in New York with an
injured achilles tendon, so the open-
ing Momix number was performed
by Jamey Hampton, another former
Pilobulus member. Jamey appeared

toured with both the Lar Lubovitch
Dance Company and the Alwin Niko-
lais Dance Theatre and has just
begun lessons with the Pittsburgh
Ballet ”to get back in shape." He pref-
ers acting to dance because it allows
for more freedom: ”Good acting
incorporates good dance, not neces-
sarily the other'way around,”he says.

Young women became enchanted
by him this summer and middle-aged

gcncing With

on stage in a white suit, hat and cane,
but what he did was not what one
might expect when seeing someone
dressed as such, thus setting the
mood for the rest of the evening.
Momix is a modern dance troupe
interested in experimenting with
movement through space and dance
particularized for film and video. The
next-to-last dance they performed
was done behind a huge screen with
lights projected from behind so that
the audience was watching shadows.
It was a curiously captivating piece.
There are no guidelines, no stan-
dards to explain what Momix does.
Approximately one-third of this par-
ticular show was improvisational
(they call it ”instant Momix”). The
rest are preconceived routines (”fro—
zen Momix") that evolve from late-
night jamming sessions in the dance
studio, sometimes with a musician

women began calling the festival offi-
ces saying, ”You’ve got to find a way
to keep him in Pittsburgh.”

’’I’m just lucky," Southern insists,
although some people working
closely with the festival did think his
attitude was a bit cocky. The cocki-
ness is a front, hiding the underlying
little-boy shyness he displayed in his
second role of the festival as the
delightfully charming Benedick in

spontaneously composing along with
them. They have a raw athletic style
(David Parsons looks as though he
could be a football player), and, in
fact, one number was performed on
skis by Daniel Ezralow and Morleigh
Steinberg, showing unbelievable

I body control.

Much of their show is filled with
this same kind of quick-witted hu-
mor. The Momix dance itself drew
belly laughs from the crowd, and they
even did one short segment where a
dancer appeared on the dark stage
with a lighted cigarette as he moved
around, so theieffect was that of
watching a cigarette dance.

One audience member, during the
rap session the company held after
the performance, called them a ”trib-
ute to the human spirit." If this is a
taste of the Dance Council's idea of
new perspectives, then the next per-

Much Ado About Nothing.
It was during this performance

that Mel Shapiro ”discovered" hir.nl

and asked him to audition for the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre, where he
is opening this week in its production
of Noel Coward's Hay Fever. South-
ern’s theory is that he should ”audi-
tion everywhere I can. Exposure is
important.” He is playing Richard
Greatham in Hay Fever.

His final role for the Shakespeare
Festival was as Cassio in Othello.
Othello director Marc Masterson says,
”Dan is an exciting actor to work
with. He has natural physical control
due to his dance training and he com-
bines a great body and voice control
with an intelligent mind and acting
decisions."

Southern has enjoyed being in
Pittsburgh. ”It’s like living in the
country, compared to New York,” he
says of the obvious differences
between the cities. He is, however,
beginning to feel anxious about job
opportunities back home. Currently,
he is waiting to hear about a contract
to direct a play off-Broadway this fall
which he wrote, entitled Etched in
Stone. If the scheduling doesn't con-
flict he may be around for the Public
Theatre's second production of His-
tory of American Film. Whatever he does
next, though, he is bound to turn it
into something worth wat_ch_ir_ig_. _g_

 
 

formances should be experiences
equally uplifting.

The Pittsburgh Dance Council will
present Kei Talcei, an avant-garde
dance troupe, on Oct. 28 and 29 and
Gail Conrad Tap Dance Theatre, on Dec. 9
and 10, both at the Pittsburgh Play-
house Craft Avenue Theatre. For

'The "Thundering Herd’:

 

WHERE THE BUFF LO ROAM

THE THUNDERING HERD
By Zane Grey
Pocket Books

They're buffalo; that's "what Mr.
Grey means by the thundering herd,
and this western novel, originally
published in 1925, makes its first
appearance in paperback. Perhaps
"legendary" is too strong a term, but
Grey's name has become synonym-
ous with the novelized horse opera.
His romanticized Great Outdoors
greatly influenced Hollywood's west-
ern film style.

The Thundering Herd takes place in
the late 1860's, just after the Civil
War, and hero, Tom Doan, means to
be a rancher. The fastest way to earn
the necessary cash is buffalo hunting
— the animals were plentiful in the
Indian territory, and their hides were
in great demand. Doan hooks up with
a “successful outfit; sighting his first
buffalo, he watches "with intense
interest only second to the hot-
pressed lust to kill.” He catches on
quickly; within 24 days, "three
hundred and sixty buffalo had fallen
to his credit.”

Milly Fayre is seventeen and an
unwilling member of another party
of hunters. She and Tom Doan meet
in passing and fall into first-sight
love, complicated by the fact that
their outfits are not traveling
together. Milly finds the hunting dis-
tasteful and overlooking Tom's part
in the game proves frustrating.

In another part of the forest, the
Indians are angered at the random

slaughter of, literally, their liveli-
hood: "when the buffalo-hunters
organized to make war upon the
marauder, that meant a general
uprising and banding together of
Comanches, Kiowas, Arapahoes, and
Cheyennes." At one point, Grey
sums things up rather neatly: "This
wild West was beginning to show its
teeth."

Grey's approach to the material is
surprisingly non-partisan. He recog-
nizes the hunters’ enormous attrac-
tion to the sport and monetary
reward of buffalo hunting. Equally,
Milly I-‘ayre’s pity for the helpless but
magnificent animals makes a strong
case for conservation. "These hun-

/2‘

ters stuck to a job that in a worthy 0

cause would have been heroic. As it
was they descended to butchers...it
was a time of carnage." The plight of

the buffalo under slaughter registers
strongly, and Grey offers a chilling
depiction of a stampede late in the
book.

Although the characters — hun-
ters and U.S. Cavalry —— have no sym-
pathy for "them redskins," the
author himself seems to respect (a bit
grudgingly, perhaps) the cunning and
resourcefulness of the Indians.

Aside from his inordinate fondness
of the word "manifest" (he uses it
several times per chapter), Zane
Grey's writing is careful, formal and
literate. The Thundering Herd's conven-
tional but well-drawn plot effectively
cross-cuts various elements — war,
the hunt, polite romance — generat-
ing a respectable taste of the western
dust and drama.

’LUDES
By Benjamin Stein
Bantam

'Ludes. You'd have to be on ’em to
enjoy this book. If a trophy were
given for the trashiest non—fiction of
the year, 'Ludes would receive a big,
round, white one with "Lemmon"
(you know —— the company that
makes Quaaludes) stamped across
the front.

One would expect better from
Benjamin Stein, WallStreet Iournal wri-
ter and former presidential speech-
writer. Instead, he leaves the reader
wondering why he bothered to write

this one in the first place. 'Ludes is
about a young hedon who throws
away a beautiful, devoted wife, a Los
Angeles home with a black—bottomed
pool, three TVs and a Mercedes Benz
in favor of a life of lying in bed, tak-
ing Quaaludes and watching
M*/i *S*H.

Lenny Brown, the book's protago-
nist (or antagonist, or — God forbid
you call him this — hero), is an aspir-
ing salesman in the Big Apple who
dreams of striking it rich and going to
L.A. Miraculously, Brown does come
across his gold mine and instantly
transforms from a poor slob to one of
the beautiful people. Greed rears its
ugly head, however, and he finds that
being rich isn't enough anymore —
he has to be richer so that he can
outshine his jet-set friends. He can't
stand the heat, so he gets out of the
kitchen — permanently.

That 'Ludes is supposedly a "true
story" says somethings sad about
today's society; that the book has
become a bestseller says something
even sadder. Skip 'Ludes. Read a Harle-
quin instead.

WAITING FOR AN ARMY TO DIE:
THE TRAGEDY OF AGENT
ORANGE _ _

Fred A. Wilcox

Vintage Books

For over a decade they fought a
war, and America has seemingly
never thanked them.

Vietnam. There are approximately
50,000 vets who will not be permitted
to forget it for the rest of their lives
— if it can be said they still have lives
left to enjoy.

Those so afflicted are experiencing

daily hell’ because of Agent Orange, a :

spray that was used as a defoliant
during most of the Vietnam years. It
is through Waiting For An ArmyTo Die
that Fred Wilcox chronicles the living
nightmares of veterans who were
exposed to the dioxin—laced com-
pound from 1961-1970.

Dioxin is the most toxic substance
known to man, 100,000 times more
potent than thalidomide in causing
birth defects in some species, accord-
ing to one FDA official. In his book,
Wilcox not only exposes the cancers,
skin diseases and mental disorders
from which Agent Orange-afflicted
vets suffer, but also delves into the
perspectives of Veterans Administra-
tion officials, physicians, governmen-
tal bureaucrats and those Americans
living in the West who have been sub-
ject to indiscriminate spraying by the
Forest Service.

In the first half of the book, Wilcox
relies on the veterans to tell their

own stories. Wilcox does not permit’ '

the reader to forget that the vets
have yet to come home from war.
They are still fighting their own,wi—
thin themselves. Some of their wives
suffer miscarriages and still born
pregnancies and give birth to infants
who suffer from cleft palates, miss-
ing ears, heart murmurs, double
reproductive organs, clubfeet, per-
manent rashes and missing fingers.
One girl was born with half her brain
missing.

Despite it all, the vets are not look-
ing for sympathy from an indifferent
populace. Wilcox again ventures
waist-deep into the incessant stone-
walling by VA officials, Department
of Defense aides and the several
manufacturers involved in Agesnt
Orange production — Dow, Mon-
santo, Diamond Shamrock and
Uniroyal.

Undoubtedly, Wilcox has done his
homework. He sought out the neces-
sary sources and successfully dealt
with the probing qsuestions essent-
sial to uncovering the issues. Wincox
may have gone overboard, though.
He devotes a lengthy chapter to the
"Vietnamization of America,” exa-
mining those who were the victoms
of the sweeping spraying here at
home.

Wilcox reveals an uncanny knack
for getting at the source. He drives
the point home in the book's final
segment with the thought-provoking
query of whether we should listen to
Vietnam vets since "they are our
future." Will what happened to them
happen to us? Make ndmistake about
it, it is not just dioxin. To paraphrase
Wilcox, chemical companies today are
using people as their guinea pigs and
the environment as their laboratory.

THE THREAT: INSIDE THE
SOVIET MILITARY MACHINE

By Andrew Cockburn

Random House

With Ronald W. Reagan as presi-
dent and Caspar Weinberger as
defense secretary pointing out that
there is some sort of a ”particle-beam
weapons" gap, many ex—military
types solemnly proclaim that ”if we
don't spend another couple of billion
dollars on the defense budget, the
dirty rotten Commies (read: the
Soviets) will kill our men, rape our
women and otherwise destroy the

American way of life.” Viewed from '

this context, The Threat helps to fill a
rather large gap in literary circles.

Many books of this genre tend to
back the Time or Newsweek style of
reporting the threat of the Soviet
Union — vast reams of statistics are
dredged up, and high—ranking gener-
als back them with the solemn con-
clusion that the Soviets and their
Warsaw Pact allies would grind
NATO forces into the ground if war
broke out next Tuesday. However, if
Congress grants the money for
particle-beam weapons development,
or if the B-1 bomber is built, NATO
will deter the Warsaw Pact from even
considering such nasty thoughts. The
Threat, on the other hand, does things
quite differently. Where Cockburn
takes the fork in the road is in his
original source material.

During the 1970s, as a result of
pressure brought on by the United
States, many Soviet Jews were
allowed to emigrate. Since all Soviet
males (regardless of religion or lack of
it) are liable for military call-up when
they turn 18, it was not a big problem
for Cockburn to talk to these types
about how ready the Soviet army was
and from this, project how ready it
could be. While a gut response would
discount their reactions because of
potential bias, Cockburn writes, ”The
same themes recur so often in their
accounts of military service, that it
seems unlikely that there could be a
Jewish bias, coloring and distorting
the true picture of military life to a
uniform degree." If this statement is
accurate, then the Pentagon probably
doesn't have quite so much to fear
because — according to this book —
drunkenness, petty thievery and
uncaring, incompetent officers are
quite common in the Soviet army.

Cockburn also highlights the
career of Admiral Sergi Gorshkov
(the Soviet Navy's equal of Hyman
Rickover), the Soviet military-
industrial complex (making one
wonder if incest is rampant between
the Kremlin and the Pentagon) and
all the while provides the badly-
needed human perspective that the
news media have failed to provide.
One hour with this book, and it's pos-
sible to rail at strangers about the
threat of the Soviet military machine.

Bonnie Tyler's Comeback:

DRAMA ON VINYL

FASTER THAN THE SPEED
OF NIGHT '
Bonnie Tyler

Columbia

Bonnie Tyler, the woman
with the whiskey—soaked voice
who hit the top five a few years
back with "It's A Heartache"
then disappeared , has stepped
back into the music scene. Well,
bounded back is more like it: Fas-
ter Than The Speed Of Night is tear-
ing its way through the charts,
and the single, ”Total Eclipse Of
The Heart,” which held the No.
1 position on the English charts
for a staggering five weeks, isn't
far behind. I

Deserved? Well, yeah, why
not? This album may not
stretch the art of rock-n-roll,
but it has stretched the limita-
tions of Tyler's vocal chords in a
positive way. Her vocals have a
harder-edge to them; she
always had the rasp, but now
there's real guts behind it. As a
result, she's become an inter-
pretive singer (she doesn't write
her own material), capable of
doing a remake justice, as well
as lending her own style to new
songs. Creedence’s ”Have You
Ever Seen The Rain?" and
Bryan Adams’ "Straight From
The Heart” are not rip—offs of

IERKY VERSIONS OF THE
DREAM

Howard Devoto

I.R.S.

Howard Devoto has culled
the tongue—in-ass humor from
his days as a Buzzcock, the
intensity from his work with
Magazine and the enigma that
he was born with, turned it 180
degrees and come up with jerlcy
Versions Of The Dream, his first
solo album after a two—year
silence.

jerky Versions is a jerky album
that lurches forward artisti-

ICCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOOCOCOOOOOO OCOCOOOOOQOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOO0OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOOIOOOOOOOOCOOO

the originals, just newly-
defined interpretations.

Jim Steinman, the man
behind Meat Loaf, has stamped
his drama—rock style all over
this LP (he's listed as producer
and director). The sound is big
— dramatic piano flourishes,
strings and loud crashing noises
abound, especially on those
numbers Steinman wrote, such
as "Total Eclipse Of The Heart."
Like Meat Loaf's brilliant rendi-
tion of "Paradise By The Dash-
board Light," "Total Eclipse Of
The Heart” works because the
singer is strong enough to over-
come the sheer theatricality of
the song; the lyrics are a touch
too glitzy (most of the lyrics
here are!), but Tyler's raw emo-
tion pulls it along with deftness.

For fact seekers, Faster Than
The Speed OfNight will be impres-
sive for the list of musicians
who worked on the album: Roy
Bittan, Bruce's keyboardist
from the E Street Band; Max
Weinberg, drummer for the
same; and guitarist Rick Derrin-
ger all contribute their talents.
Even David Letterman's motley
crew of late-night bashers, Paul
Schaffer, Hiram Bullock and
Steve Jordan, can be heard on a
few songs, and Martin Briley
("Salt Of My Tears") plays gui-

cally, mixing in moments of
sheer Devoto genius with a few
instances of the artsy-fartsy.
This album seems to be a conti-
nuation of Devoto’s twisted fas-
cination with pursuit of The
Dream — life's dreams, that is,
but with someone like him, who
can ever tell (he could be singing
about lemmings or something)?
Still, Magazine mourners will
not turn away from this one,
nor will anyone who is not
afraid to laugh and think
simultaneously.

Rhythmically, this album is
more complex than most of

fOO0000°°"°OlOA3G GHVMOH yooooooooooocooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooo¢BONNIE TYLER oooooonooooooocoooooooooooooooooooOOO00

somebody must've inherited
grandma's moonshine money to
pay for that bunch!

But, famous names aside,
there's really only one person

Magazine's past catalogue and
all of the Buzzcocks' brilliant
trash. Although there's a lot of
plinky keyboard and synthesiz-
er work by Dave Formula (also
of the late Magazine), Ierky Ver-
sions is no excursion into the
cesspool of syntho—pop. Instead,
is also offers a lot of
Rumourish-guitar chords by
Devoto and Alan St. Clair and
even an occasional saxophone
sex act by Gary Barnacle.‘

~ Or course, those who pay to
hear Devoto’s lyrics will be
happy to know that the man is
just as cryptic as he always was,
not to mention that his voice is
starting to sound like Marc
Almonds. His typically British
humor, when it can be leeched
from the songs, sounds like con-
torted Monty Python mono-
logue and is almost evident on
"Taking Over Heaven," "Some
Will Pay (For What Others Pay
To Avoid)" and "Out Of Shape
With Me" (or "Way Out Of
Shape," the slightly different
version of the same song).
None-the-less, Devoto can still
arrest with "serious" tunes like
"Cold Imagination" and "Rainy
Season," a chillingly pathetic
love song that shows him at his
best.

For someone with Devoto’s
perception and talent, this is not
a perfect album; cuts like "I
Admire You" prevent it from
reaching that plateau. How-
ever, Ierky Versions Of The Dream
is proof positive that Howard
Devoto still has that rare vision
of his world and his music. It's
only a matter of time before he
lets everyone concerned in on
the mystery.

and then went in and banged on
the pots and pans and sang
about being "Bad Boys" or some
other adolescent piffle. Wonder
if these guys ever heard of
Prince. Probably not, but it sure
sounds like they're big fans of
The Silver Convention.

George Michael and Andy
Ridgeley, the two guys who
make up Wham! U.K. are sup-
posedly only 18 but shit, that
doesn't give them any right to
put out this, this...mess. The
only cut that has any redeeming
qualities is ”Young Guns (Go

album, so who wants to wade
through the rest of this, this...
crap to get to one song.

Please remain calm and go

remember: if nobody buys this
album, it can't hurt anyone.

BITE
Altered Images
Columbia

Claire Grogan has grown up.
No more silly songs about
insects and dead pop stars. No
more chirpings about happy
birthdays. She's packed away all
the little dresses with frilly rib-
bons and lace and invested
heavily in make-up. Now she
looks like a cross between Edie
Sedgewick and early Audrey
Hepburn. But the music's
changed and so has the voice.
Claire's lost some of the man-
overboard cutesiness that used
to mar so much of Altered
Images’ material. On Bite, she
opts for stronger vocals and
tones down the little—girl qual-
ity, which her voice will always
have. She appears to have bet-
ter breath control (though you
can't always tell with modern
recording wizardry), holding
notes longer and fuller than she
used to. ”Don't Talk To Me
About Love," for example, has
her holding her own against a
dense swirl of dance rhythms
and layers of background vocals

The music, too, has been
undergoing changes recently.
Mike Chapman and Tony Vis-
coti, each of whom produced
four songs on Bite, are known
for the slick, clean sound they
achieve in the production booth,
and they can add Altered Images
to their list of successes. The
overall sound is much lusher
than that on their first two
albums, Happy Birthday and Pinlcy

Blue, and they've obviously
entertained thoughts of dance-
floor popularity — the tracks
are the beat—conscious kind that

improve on a dolby system.’

"Another Lost Look" even has
an intro that makes you believe
that Richard Butler's macabre
voice is going to come in any
second — the instrumental
arrangement is that rich.

Bite may not thrill some
Altered Images fans who liked
the nursery-rhyme quality of
the band's earlier work. But
don’tbe istaken, the album is a

definite step forward; any band
who realizes that in order to
garner more than a cult follow-
ing, they've got to strip down
and start over again, is a band
who stands a better chance than
most of surviving.

around in various forms since
recording for several
small labels and gaining limited
exposure and favorable critical
response. Their RCA debut El’,
Numbers With Wings, aims for
wider audiences.

The quartet consists of
Richard Barone, lead vocals and
guitar; Rob Norris, bass; Frank
Giannini, percussion; and James
Mastro, the newest Bongo, on
guitar. Continuing the tradition
of last year's Nuts and Bolts, a solo
album by Barone and Mastro,
Numbers offers solid, upbeat pop
music blending a secure center
of bass/guitar/drum, occasional
keyboards and a hint of the
expected percussive variety —
'60s influences with an '80s
beat.

Love and loneliness, favorite
song themes for centuries, are
the substance of the five
numbers. The title cut provides
a good opener for the disc,
working out of the "I've got
your number" idea. "On slow
nights I forgive anyone/I got a
number with wings," Barone
explains.

With “solid, acceptable
pop/rock, The Bongos reaffirm
traditions and still manage to
cre_ate their own "sound."
Numbers With Wings proves capa-

Bongos now have the signifi-
cant task of proving their valid-
ity with a good follow—up.

Setter Cathy Rupp will headline a possibly revamped offense starting against Florida

State tonight.

The Unknown

Spikers Enterin

Twilight

By MARK A. SINDLER

All week long the gears have been
shifting. First there was the thought
of defending a record, eternal right
now, that lacks defeats. Next came
the burden of temporarily scrapping
an offensive scheme that has been in
the works for three weeks. Injuries
can do that.

Shortly thereafter apprehension
appeared — the kind detectable by
only those gypsy palm readers —
over starting two freshmen. Of
course, they both played exceptional
high school ball. But this is the col-
lege game, where efficiency is
expected and not prayed for.

Most importantly, it was difficult
not to drip with caution over playing
schools with Top 20 tradition for the
first time this season.

With all the more power to him,
Pitt women’s volleyball coach Shel-
ton Collier has contended with such
details since Sunday evening. That
was when the fourth-year coach
recorded his 10th win this season.
Contrastingly, the loss column still
sits lonely.

This weekend, Collier aims to
keep all visitors out. It will not be an
easy stand. The Lady Panthers are
hosting the Pitt Classic, a four-team
invitational featuring Penn State,
Florida State and Louisville.

Although FSU is the only present
Top 20 resident, at 20th, the three
others are not far from the driveway
leading to such a garage of the
nation’s elite.

For Collier, at least that was the
case prior to last weekend. Faith
took a slight turn downward,
though, when captain Judy Young,
a junior, sprained her right ankle

Zone

late Sunday afternoon. She hasn’t
really practiced since, some sporadic
serving the only exception.

Young and another setter, Cathy
Rupp, have been designated starters
in Collier’s first-ever manipulation
of the 6-2 offense. In it, Young and
Rupp are simultaneously employed
as setters and hitters.

Now that has all gone by the
wayside.

Against the three teams, Young is
listed as doubtful-at-best, although
trainers have been known to come
through in the clutch. Ifso and if she
gets a probable OK, then Young will
play and Collier will rotate his
offense.

With Young out, he will go with
the sturdy 5-l, Rupp the lone setter.
Only thing is, for the past three and a
half weeks, six returning players
have been playing and scrimmaging
in a 6-2 arrangement.

That forces more switches in posi-
tioning. Junior Ulana Kohutiak, in a
5-l, will be moved to the left side
from her middle-hitting confines.
On the opposite antenna will be Pat
Belcher, probably Collier’s most
powerful cannon from the outside.

In the middle will be sophomore
Carmen Tapia, a starting hitter fora
second straight year.

“By switching we’ll be losing some
strategic moves that we would other-
wise have the opportunity to do,”
Collier noted. “What that does is put
a lot more responsibility on the
hitters.”

The backcourt will see two fresh-
men starters, Sue Hoover and Kris
Wexell. It is a gamble with still-
darkened results. Hoover certainly
carries the credentials Coming from

At This Stage, Pitt’s Performance Admirable

By MARK A. SINDLER

Only surrendering three points in
its first two games? Before the start
of his second football season in the
driver’s seat, Pitt head coach Foge
Fazio had to be wondering if that
would be all his offense could aver-
age by now.

The skeptics have turned into
moles, rapidly burrowing them-
selves out of earshot. Straddling a
2-0 record with the weekend off, the
Panthers have made believers out of
the mistrusting.

No doubt there are still some of
the diehard nonbelievers who might
be able to make a case for Pitt’s turn-
ing over and playing possum.

First on the trial court's agenda is
listed the Panthers’ offensive line.
After surprising Tennessee and wip-
ing out Temple, Fazio and offensive
line coordinator Joe Moore have
done imitations Barnum & Bailey
would be proud of.

Tackle Bill Fralic and center Jim
Sweeney aside, Fazio and Moore are
now considered certified jugglers.
Greg Christy, a 6-4, 280-lb. junior,
was handed a diagnosis before sea-
son’s start that gave no credence to a
knee that could barely stake tomato
plants.

Yet there he was at left guard
against Tennesse for 3l plays. In
that same game, Fralic was switched
to right tackle for several downs.
And for good reasons. Ever since

left guard Mike Dahl pulled a
namstring at Edinboro, tne lines
strong side turned sour.

Chances of his coming back soon
are as good as some entreprenuer‘s
raising the Titanic. Four days ago.
he bruised his knee on some dorm
steps.

Fazio said earlier in the week, “He
still continues to get hurt without
playing. We’re thinking of moving
his bed into the trainer’s room.”

Surprisingly, though, the line has
shown venerable stability. This,
even though the Panthers have for-
gone live blocking drills since train-
ing camp's final day.

“Give them a lot pf credit,” Fazio
said of his line. “[Last] Tuesday was
the first day of live mini-wars. It’s an
old proverb: You have to keep firing
at live targets. Credit Joe Moore for
that helping us tremendously."

In a late move last Saturday,
Fazio shoved Sweeney over to left
guard and put in his place senior
Tony Magnelli. No problems.
Equally so, others with hard-to-
come-by prominence have substi-
tuted admirably. Those include
sophomore Barry Pettyjohn at cen-_
ter and on the left side, Ted Olshanki
and Jim Shriver at guard and fresh-
man Randy Dixon at tackle.

The “kids” they have been putting
muscle in front of only make_the
deists sulk deeper. John Cummings
started the season with aspirations
akin to running for the presidency.
Despite playing in a cemetary of a
first half, he and his comrades
stormed an unknowing Vols secon-
dary enroute to passing for IIO
yards on nine completions and I8
attempts, one of which was mis-
guided into a defender’s hands.

Later in the game, Cummings was
also misguided into linebacker Alvin
Toles‘ hands, which sandwiched his
left collarbone. Cummings is getting
to know Dahl pretty well now.

Meantime, John Congemi. a mere
sophomore, started in his place
against Temple and used the first

three quarters to wield a deadly scal-
pel. The Owls’ dissection produced
15 of 23 passes for 177 yards — an
impressive .652 percentage.

“During the week, in my mind, it
was to go out and say, ‘I’m the quar-
terback,’ and not consider any ques-
tions in my mind," Congemi said. “I
had the picture, and luckily, I did
OK."

Fazio sounds like the daddy of a
brand new baby boy.

“We were quite pleased with John
and the way he accepted the chal-
lenge,” he observed. “He was mak-
ing all the correct decisions and
taking us out of bad plays. Not only
that, his passing was executed well.”

Out of the same backfield, the
running game has, uh, been noticea-
ble. That‘s it, due in part to the lack
of big ground eaters like the bruising
Earl Campbell of yore. Pitt’s top two
tanks are fullbacks Marlon McIn-
tyre and —— blink twice — junior
Marc Bailey, who is gradually com-
ing into his own.

Tailback Joe McCall has been
averaging a meek 2.1 yards on 28
attempts that have netted 58 yards.
Ahead of him, Mclntyre has strolled
for I24 on 21 attempts for 5.9 per
carry, followed by Bailey’s four
yards per handoff (18 for 72 yards).

That should slowly change as
McCall’s bruised ribs enjoyably
anticipate the off weekend and fully
heal for Maryland next week.

By then, the defense might con-
template having some Excedrin on
hand. Not extra-strength, mind you,
but enough to avert delusions of
holding opponents to nary a touch-
down. Temples will be hard to come
by for awhile.

-...::,..

So far, however, the tradition
lives on, evidenced by its present
ranking third in the nation in total
defense. Juniors Troy Benson and
Caesar Aldisert, both linebackers,
are one-two in leading all with tack-
les at 29 and 25, respectively.

Not taking anything away from
him, rushend Al Wenglikowski
already owns four sacks, followed
by Chris Doleman. Doleman, a 6-6,
220-lb. mean machine at tackle, has
his lucky stars to thank for starting
the two games he has.

If Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis
were asked who the standout
players were in his team's 3-1 win
over St. Vincent on Wednesday
night, he might give seven or
eight different answers. Finally,
he would say, “It was a good
team game."

The victory extended Pitt's
winning streak to three games.

Vic Hugo opened the scoring
for the Panthers (3-2) in the 44th
minute of the first half on an
assist from forward Dave Van
Newkirk. After getting the ball
on the left, Hugo dribbled the
ball into the middle of the field
and fired a shot into the upper
right-hand corner of the goal
from 18 yards out.

Pitt Extends Win
Streak To 3, Tops
St. Vincent 3-1

After Rich Sheldon scored to
tie the game for St. Vincent 12:52
into the second half, Rich God-
frey gave Pitt the lead for good
on a penalty kick in the 30th
minute.

Godfrey, who practices
penalty kicks regularly, was
awarded the kick after being
tripped inside the box. St. Vin-
cent‘s goalkeeper, Mike Sagon,
shaded him to the left, the side he
normally shoots to, but be
adjusted and tucked the balljust
inside the post, to the keeper’s
right.

Van Newkirk closed out the
scoring seven minutes later as he
outraced Sagon and slid the ball
into the goal.

Going into the game, Bemis

Richland, the Class AA champion,
she has already competed in several
national Junior Olympic tourna-
ments and “was in tune to high
school level volleyball like we play,”
Collier said.

Wexell has three years of Class
AAA championship experience
from Norwin under her belt. If that
isn’t adequate insurance, Allstate is
in the business of marketing used
cars.

Still, though, the fact remains that
both are freshmen. Shaking the
image needs more time than one
weekend.

And, oh, what a weekend it
should turn out to be. Collier
remains foiled in attempt to‘ con-
struct a survivor of the classic.

“I really don’t know who’s going
to win it,” he observed. “I would say
I really do ﬂuctuate from thinking.
Without Penn State’s injury, they
would be the favorite. They have no
top-line substitute for [Patty Skade-
land]. Similarly, we have no top-line
sub for Judy at her position.“

Collier is referring to Penn State’s
top middle blocker, who is out for
the season with a broken right leg. It
will not bring Collier down on his
guard against the cross-state rivals,
though.

“Penn State is a team that serves
very consistently. They rarely make
serving errors. We‘ll probably have
more serving aces, but also more
misses.”

Whether against Penn State or
FSU and Louisville, Collier will be
most observant of the first two

games in each match. To be watched
will be opposing serves, a factor,
Collier maintains, that carivgive each
side anywhere from six to eight
points.

I-le ought to know. Such slim mar-
gins can mean the difference
between coming out on top or sink-
ing slowly this weekend, the teams
so closely equal in talent.

By DALE MOORE

0ne'can sum up the 1983 Pitt
Lady Panther cross country team in
one word—small. And that's putting
it nicely.

For Lady Panther coach Elbert
Kennedy, Jr., it is the old good-
news / bad-news story. The bad news
is that the Lady Panthers have lost

. four of last year’s ﬁve team members

to graduation. The good news is that
the returning member, sophomore
Amy DiFrancesco, was the No. I
harrier for the Lady Panthers last
season.

DiFrancesco doesn’t have to

worry much about losing her No. I
rating, either. At the moment, she is
the only member of the Lady
Panther cross country team—if it
can be called a team.

One of the reasons that DiFran-
cesco is alone. according to
Kennedy, is that this year produced
a poor crop of female distance
runners out of high school.

“I went to the (Pennsylvania) state
cross country meet last year and
didn‘t see any seniors, or even jun-
iors, that I thought could help the
team," Kennedy said.

When Kennedy refers to the team,
he doesn’t mean only the cross coun-
try team, but also the indoor and
outdoor track teams. Since Kennedy
has no budget for cross country at
Pitt, he must take funds from his
track budget to recruit distance
runners. And like every other coach
on a budget, Kennedy must try to get
the most mileage out of his scholar-
ship dollar.

"ri{é'§ii{ i»ie"v}s‘,“i-"r‘;da‘y,’ September is,'i‘98‘3

 'DiFrancesco: A Solid First On A Weak Team

two-thirds of Kennedy’s schedule
and get much more publicity than
cross country, Kennedy must look at
how the athlete can help him, first on

 

the track, and then, possibly, on the
cross country course.

Another reason for Di!-‘rancesco
being the lone runner is an absence
of walk-ons. In the past, walk-ons
provided the extra bodies needed to
fill out the team, but this year none
have come forward.

Kennedy attributes this lack of
walk-ons to the growing compete-
tiveness of women’s athletics. In the
past, according to Kennedy, only
the very best women were recruited
by a few schools and the others went
to college and walked-on. Now with
increasing competition in women's
athletics, more women are receiving
scholarships to run for different
schools. This takes away the runner
who previously would have gone to
college and tried out for cross coun-

is... 19"

Walk-ons are welcome to try out
until the Oct. I, but Kennedy is
interested in more than the casual
l°££¢f.-

“In the past, teams used to let any-
one who came out run and travel
with the team,” Kennedy said. “But
now, with the [running] times com-
ing down, the girls aren't coming
out."

Although it looks as if Kennedy
will get no help this season, he is
optimistic and feels that sometime in
the not-too-distant future, the Lady
Panthers will be competitive in cross
country once again. g

That doesn’t help DiFrancesco
out this season. But she should look
on the bright side—she may be
lonely travelling to her meets, but at
least she won’t have any trouble

The CITADEL is an entirely new concept in
bike locks. lts thru-hardened Molychrome"
alloy means boltcutters can't dent it; hacksaws

cylinder has over 700.000 possible key com-
binations. The exclusive cylinder Drill Guard"
thwarts drilling attacks. Security features like
these are the reason why CITADEL is recom-
mended by more police departments than any
other bike lock.

Warranty pays up to $350

The security of the CITADEL is backed up
by a unique one year warranty. if your bicycle is
stolen due to the failure of the lock to prevent
the theft, we'll pay you the value of your bike
up to $350.‘

easy to use. It unlocksin two separate pieces
to secure your bike quickly to a bike stand or
other stationary object. And, its durable vinyl
coating protects your bike's finish. An optional
storage bracket is available for carrying the
CWACDEL when it's not in use.

This Once-Redshirted Forecaster On Comeback

   

Viewpoint

By SCOTT DELLETT

Due to popular demand —— my
own —— the all-time favorite column
returns to this paper, albeit two
weeks late. Starting today and con-
tinuing throughout the rest of the
football season, this writer will try to
forecast the results of the numerous
college and professional football
games.

Last year, yours truly was rolling
along on a winning streak — even
though I missed the Minnesota-
Northwestern game — when injury
struck. After taking a redshirt, I'm
ready to go. Like Foge Fazio’s

The Pitt News, Friday, September 16, 1983

favorite football team, you can
count on me in ’83.

Enough of this. Here are this
week’s picks:

West Virginia at Maryland: A
classic matchup between two Rod-
ney Dangerfield teams -— each
deserves a little more respect. Both
have outstanding quarterbacks in
Boomer Esiason and Jeff Hostetler.
The game will go down to the final
minutes. Maryland 28, West Virgi-
nia 27.

Iowa at Penn State: The Nittany
Lions 0-3 with Alabama coming up.
That is possible, especially since
Iowa should contend for the Rose
Bowl. Yet, Joe Paterno should come
through, despite the offensive prob-
lems. Penn State 21. Iowa 17.

Georgia at Clemson: The Bull-
dogs have too much talent on
defense for Clemson, even though
the game is being played in Tiger
land. Georgia 20, Clemson 3.

Texas at Auburn: Both teams
have been ranked pre-season No. 1
by various magazines. In a game
with teams so closely matched, one

must 20 with the home team.
Auburn 21, Texas 20.

Indiana at Kentucky: The pre-
vious theory goes down the drain
with this game. Even though the
Wildcats broke a long losing streak
last week, in does not mean they will
win this one. Indiana 17, Kentucky
7.

Navy at Mississippi State: Far
and away are the Midshipmen out-
classed in this one. Mississippi State
28, Navy 7.

Purdue at Miami (Fla): The Boil-
ermakers are still hurting from the
52-6 beating they received from
Notre Dame. Miami should sweep
them away. Miami 31, Purdue 10.

Michigan State at Notre Dame:
Hail the Fighting Irish! They have
returned. George Perles has little
more than a hope and a prayer.
Notre Dame 30, Michigan State 6.

Stanford at Illnois: The lllini have
adjusted better to losing Tony Eason
than Stanford has to losing John
Elway. Does that show which one
was better? Illinois 24, Stanford 20.

Missouri at Wisconsin: Despite
losing a number of his coaching
staff, Warren Powers still has a
decent team. Missouri 17, Wiscon-
sin 14.

Ohio State at Oklahoma: The
Sooners are very hungry for a
national championship. The Buck-
eyes have a very good team, but
Marcus Dupree and Company are
tough in Norman. Oklahoma 24,
Ohio State 21.

Michigan at Washington:
Another good matchup — scrap the
column and do it next week, this is
too tough. The common case of the
Pac-l0’s dominating the Big 10 will
hold, but barely. Washington 20,
Michigan 17.

Arizona State at UCLA: This may
be a first. I predict a tie. Arizona
State 20, UCLA 20.

Steelers at Houston: No doubt
this game is a mismatch, but the Oil-
ers have always given Pittsburgh fits
in the Astrodome. A win, but not
without a fight. Steelers 21, Houston
10.

played a highly aggressive game
with the emphasis on pressure,
but the Panthers applied some
pressure of their own, earning l2
corner kicks.

And along with the aggressive
style came fouls, 35 of them in
all. Nineteen were issued to Pitt,
including a yellow card warning
to forward Rich Howard.

“It was a very aggressive game.
They played like I figured they
would,” Bemis said. “Tactically,
we can play better. We just got
into their game.”

The Panthers will have to call
on all resources as they face

“We know we have a tough
game with Slippery Rock,”
Bemis said. “I heard they

Performance Draws Acclaim

continued from page seventeen

In training camp’s first week.
Fazio shipped him back to the city to
clear up academic turmoil with
Dean Shulman and consequently
demoted him two teams.

Everything now is seemingly
defogged, including his relationship
with Fazio. But the battle still rages
on; it will be interesting to see who
gets to the opposing passer more
often, Wenglikowski or Doleman.

Missing from the picture will be
defensive end Chuck Williams.
After completing a cybex test three
days ago, the freshman from Free-
dom will be medically redshirted for
the year due to right knee injuries
suffered in the July Penn—Ohio All-
Star Game. Eligibilty is still
extended for four more years.

Backing up a few steps to the
secondary, assistant coach Dino
Folino is determinedly molding a
buoyant bunch of backs. Free safety
Tom Flynn and left cornerback
Troy Hill are reading coverages with

textbook efficiency. Another cor-
nerback, Melvin Dean, waited for
the season to start with baited eyes
and wasted no time in picking up his
first interception with only three and
a half minutes elapsed against
Tennessee.

The other safety, strongside Bill
Callahan, is 10th overall, seventh in
tackles. Otherwise, no blown
coverages.

They used to offer the kicking
team respect afforded hillbillies in

Hollywood. Change is in the offer—
ing. Senior punter Tony Recchia is
making his recently-validated scho-
larship pay off as his 42.3 yard aver-
age so verily indicates.

And placekicker Eric Schubert is
persuasively making all forget about
his missing on 10 field goals in 21
tries last season. Already he‘s hit on
four in as many attempts.

Already no shocking surprises are
evident. The Panthers are likely to
watch tomorrow’s WVU—Maryland
game with a microscope in one hand
and a pencil in the other. It is a sign
that writing off their season this
early falls just short of one’s sticking
his head in the sand.

 

Tailback JoeMScC|l no ranks third in team  
yards on 28 carries.

It’s a bigger chal-
lenge and a lot more
responsibility than
most corporations give
you at 22. The rewards
are bigger, too. There’s

package of benefits,
including special duty pay. The starting
salary is $17 ,0O0—more than most com-
panies would pay you right out of college.
After four years, with regular promo-
tions and pay increases, your salary will
have increased to as much as $31,000.

As a Navy officer, you grow, through
new challenges, new tests of your skills,

and new opportunities
to advance your edu-

possibility of attending
graduate school while
