Jeff Miller, a potential candidate

_«"~for Student Government president

lost his bid, 7-O before a special
elections committee hearing to
decide whether his name should be
placed on the Nov. 12, 13. and 14
ballot. -
Miller lost his case on the basis
of his failure to meet the 2.5 grade
point average requirement estab-
lished ‘by the revised Student
Government constitution. He
claims ‘that three incomplete
grades on his transcript were
changed late Friday afternoon,
thus pulling his average well above
due requirement. Miller contests
that because he did receive grades
for the courses before the"5 p.m.
Oct. 26 filing deadline ‘he should be
permitted‘ to participate‘ in the
election.‘ _ , . " p
Miller also charged that "some
members of the elections commit-

him with the contents of his
transcript before he received a copy

‘Scan iForm'Sysiem Will Shorten Lines In G-ill 7,Speed Billing   i if

By MARGI STUMPF .
Pitt News Staff Writer

A number of changes have been
made in the course registration
process that are designed to cut
both the time students must. stand
in the G-17 line and the amount of
clerical work needed to process
course, conﬁrmation notices and
tuition invoices. ~

The changes “are a processof
evolution” that includes the switch
from processing several keypunch-
ed computer cards per registration
to use of a single “\scan form,"
according to Paul Popovich, assis-
tant registrar.

The scan form is similar to those
used when taking standardized
tests. Alpha codes for each course
are coded for the registration office
gcomputer by blackening small dots

on the scan form with a pencil. This
type of form was put into use four
years ago in ’ some’ university
schools to process grade reports
and has evolved into the university-'
wide registration scan form for
Winter Term 1980, Popovich said.

The time required for producing
and mailing tuition bills has been
cut in, half,with the use of scan

. forms, he added. By feeding only
one form per student into the

«

computer instead of many key- ’

punched cards, work time is cut

gand students will receive their

invoices “within five work days’? of

said. Under the keypunch card

Miller ‘Cited the fact that
according to the Buckley Amend-
ment a student's academic record
is privileged and should not be
released without the permission of
that student.

Suekoff said Miller approached
him at 6:10 p.m. on Friday with
testimony that three professors
changed three incomplete grades
on his transcript.

“All that he had to offer were the .

names of the professors, and no
documentation that the grades
were even changed,” Suekoff said.
“Jeff did not bring this documen-
tation to the elections committee
hearing on Monday and once again

all he offered, us were the phone’

numbers of the professors and it is
not my job or the job of the
committee to contact. these profes-
sors to verify that his grades were

Suekoff admitted that both he
and Steve Fendler. chairman of the
SGB Judicial Board. approached
Miller before the Friday 5 p.m.
deadline to discuss the possibility
that Miller might not meet the
grade point requirement.

“I heard rumor -of it—the fact
that Miller might not meet the
grade point requirement from
somebody, that’s all I’ll say. and]
approached Jeff with his best
interest in mind to give him the
opportunity to remedy the situation

“Doing better- with, not
without” the energy we have is
what Lee Schipper, of the
Energy and Environment Divi-
sion of Lawrence Berkley
Laboratories suggests.

Schipper spoke Tuesday- on
the role of conservation of
energy as a part of the Future
Power lecture series at David
Lawrence Hall.

He said he believes the
solution to the energy problem

  Energy Conservation Burn

lies in responsible conservation
of energy, both on an indivi-
dual and national level.

. “We have chosen to argue
about oil, solar, andnuclear
power—and they are inter-
esting arguments in their own
right—but we can’t let‘ them
obscure -conservation as they
have done for the last ~ six
years.” .

According to Schipper, the
motivation for conservation lies‘
in the ;fact thatall thelnew_
systems would cost more than

the‘eitisting ones in terms of .
risks, expenses, and possible
side effects involved.

But Schipper cautioned, “If
we're interested in conserving
energy, we ought to be more
careful when we start talking
about what you can and can’t
do. You may be in for political
trouble. You may do things
that don’t' save much energy,
or things may actually back-
fire.” ‘ ‘

that every country faces are the
production of necessary energy
for heating homes and for
transportation. Inefficient
energy production for those
areas causes the most waste,
Schipper said. ’

He said that although 1979
was a bad year in terms of
energy prices Americans still
paid the least for gas, as
compared to other nations like

\Africans nations where gas and
v . oil price increases are  excess.-

s Other Methods, Speaker Says  

Schipper also spoke‘ on mass
transit’s role in energy conser- V -
vation, saying he found that it ’
uses energy ineffectively, while
the airlineiindustry is the most
productive in energy utili-
zation. Schipper believes that
an increase in air technology
will lead to more utilization of
this type of transportation.

“Conservation is» the only
way to lower the cost of energy. '

Secretary

_ "HARRISBURG-Gov. Dick Thom-

burgh yesterday ﬁred Common-
wealth Secretary Ethel Allen for
excessive absences, using state
employees to write speeches and
making false statements.

She is the third cabinet member
to be dismissed this month‘. And
‘her ﬁring touched off a further
reshufﬂing of Thornburgh’s cabi-
net.

Allen, who refused to resign,
was ﬁred during a 25-minute
private meeting in Thomburgh’s
o_ffiﬁc‘e.A _In a statement, the
governor said he had “no choice”
to act after the series of
circumstances.

“I must conclude that the
combination of them renders it

impossible to sustain the kind of

trust and working relationship that
would be necessary for you to
perform effectively," the governor
said.

Aides said the ﬁnal straw came
last week when Dr. Allen told the
media she had‘ met with Thom-

» burgh and considered the matter

“closed without prejudice.’,’

Thornburgh issued a sharply
contradictory statement, saying the
issue was very much alive. And in
a letter to Dr. Allen, Thornburgh
said he was “frankly dismayed” by
her conduct.

“You issued a press release
attributing views and statements to
me on this matter which I simply
had not expressed, and most
importantly, you did so after you
‘were advised by my ofﬁce that the
attributed views and statements
were incorrect,” the governor said.

“Whatever the motive for such

action may have been, I feel that it

destroys the type of mutual trust
and conﬁdence that must exist
‘between a governor and a cabinet

secretary, ” Thornburgh’ added.
The Allen controversy erupted
last week Thornburgh requested

her to respond to published reports

about her absences in writing.

She admitted being absent 21 of
40 working days from her Harris-
burg ofﬁce. And she said she had
been paied $2,000 for making 12 of
her 118 speeches.

And on Tuesday, her press
secretary, Andrea McKenna, said
she ‘had prepared two speech
outlines for her boss. /Dr. Allen, a
former Philadelphia councilwoman
and one of two blacks
Thornburgh’s cabinet, was paid
$800 for the two speeches.

Former Commonwealth‘ Secre-

‘ tary C. DeLores Tucker was fired

by Gov. Milton Shapp for using
state employees to write speeches
that earned her over $65,000 in
honoraria. I

Dr. Allen issued a statement
following her ﬁring but did not
address the speciﬁc issues listed‘ by
Thornburgh. However, she de-
fended her speech-making. _

“I believe that government must
go to the people, must meet with
them, hear their concerns and
discuss with them the problems
that confront this state,” she said.

“I truly loved my job and derived
great enjoyment in doing it,” Dr.
Allen added, saying _she will
continue to speak out on issues.

Meanwhile, the Legislative Black
Caucus said it was “shocked,
dismayed and angered at the
action.” The caucus said it would
make no further comments until
meeting with Dr. Allen today.

Last weekend, the state NAACP
condemned Thomburgh’s handling
of the Allen affair as “attempted

_ character assasination.” But aides
said it remained to be seen if there
would be a backlagh from the

A A Erie County. Representative Held For Trial  S

State Rep. David S. Hayes of
Erie County was ordered Tuesday
to stand trial on charges that he
allegedly raped a 17-year-old boy at
a suburban motel. V

Magistrate Lee Mazur concluded
after a preliminary hearing that the
Allegheny County district attor-
ney's offtce presented enough
evidence to try the lawmaker on
charges of rape, involuntary
sexual intercourse, in-
decent assault and corrupting the
morals of a minor.

Mazur said prosecutors dropped
a charge of forcible restraint.

Hayes, 37, did not testify during
the hour-long proceeding. He
remained free on. $15,000 bond.

The six-"term Republican was
arrested Friday morning at a
Monroeville motel, where author-

occurred after Hayes drugged the

youth with laughing gas.

ed him in Monroeville Mall, asked
about‘ the area’s nightlife and
pursuaded him to take $10 to drive

with him to downtown Pittsburgh’s

I

 The complex chain of . events’ in Jeff Mille‘r’s~

application to be Student Government Board
presidential candidate presents a web that even

if A Sherlock Holmes might find hard to unravel. When

reduced to its essence, however, the case appears to

have three basic aspects. . .
First, there is the SGB Elections Committee’s

 ﬁnding that ‘Miller had only a 2.339 grade point

r 1”‘.

average and failed to meet the requirement that a

in "presidential candidate must have _a 2.5 average.

Second is Miller’s appealthat he has a 2.5 average,

' but that university records do not show it because his '
- professors have not yet changed three “G” grades on

his record to the’ correct letter grades. The

"f-final‘ and most curcial question is how student

. government officers knew about possible problems

i_ with Miller’s transcript before he submitted it to the
Elections Committee. ’

\

. The first two strands of the web are-. interrelated
and have raised interesting problems for the Elect-
ions Committee and the Judiciary of SGB. These two
problems. began when Miller, thinking there was
nothing wrong with his transcripts, waited until
Thursday to get a copy of his grades, and found he

_ was not able to receive a transcript because he owed

the unviersity $16. Miller said he paid the money and

A i then had to wait until Friday, the day the transcript

According to Miller, he did not realize he would
have less than a 2.5 average until Friday when the
Elections Committee computed his average and
found that three “G” grades made his Q.P.A. less
than the requirement. Miller appealed to the
Elections Committee Monday night, saying he had
completed the work in the courses for which he had
received “G” grades. Finding that Miller should
have been more responsible and taken care of the
matter earlier, the committee voted 7-0 to deny Miller
a position on the ballot. ~

Both sides on this issue have good arguments, and

the problem must ,be decided ultimately by_ the V

Elections Committee and the Juciciary. Miller’s
contention that he did not know there was anything
wrong with his transcript before Friday must be given
some credence, but the argument that Miller should
have acted earlier to check his transcript has as much
weight. If Millerdecides to appeal the Elections
Committee’s decision, ‘-that body must ‘weigh
carefully the opposing views to reach a just decision.
The final aspect of the Miller affair is the most

disturbing one, and must be investigated immediately I

by the Office ‘for Student Affairs and Charlene
Hunter, the coordinator of the ‘University Student
Judicial Systems, _because it involves alleged
violations of the federal privacy act.

‘Both Mark Suekoff, chairman of the Elections

Committee and Steve Fendler, chairman of the SGB.

Judiciary, admit that they approached Miller and

told him they had, heard rumors that Miller’s‘

transcript might, not be in order. According to
Miller, this occured before the university would

‘release the records because of the $-16 debt and before

Miller knew his transcripts still contained three “G”
grades. _If Miller truly was ignorant of the “G”

’ . Page 6—Wednesday, October 31, 1979

grades on his transcript and told no one about
possible problems with his Q.P.A., this situation
seems to suggest a violation of federal law.

Fendler’ and Suekoff refused to say wehre they
heard the rumor, but their knowledge of it makes it
appear that someone within student government had
gotten access to Miller’s transcripts. This would be a
violation of the privacy act, which forbids the release
of a student’s records to any person outside the
university administration, unless the student gives
permission for the release. 3‘

In light of these circumstances, Student Affairs,

and Hunter must attempt to find answers to four
questions. First, is,Miller telling the truth? Second,
why would someone care what Miller’s transcript
showed if he is telling the truth? Third, who would
want to.know this information? And, fourth, how
did someone- get access to this supposedly
confidential information? ‘ ' -

These four questions must be pursued not only
because of possible illegal acts, but also because the
incident appears linked to the SGB elections,,creating
doubts about the, integrity of student government,

.. the people involved in it and the upcoming elections.

Until the problem is addressedand the questions
answered, no one can be sure whether student‘
government and (all) the people associated with it are
ethical, honest and trustworthy. No representative.
group can maintain credibility while such questions

persist. _ .
It is the more imperative for the university to

investigate, considering the possible results from
inaction. If federal‘ officials became aware of these
alleged infractions, it could initiate its own
investigation. .Pitt then could lose some or all of its
federal funding, in the case that the government finds
the charges to be true and worthy of serious action.

During the course of the
“celebration” I saw many inci-

Two persons were hit on the head
by bottles thrown from Tower A,
several students were observed
throwing ﬁrecrackers and shooting
b’ottle rockets into the crowd, one
car was overturned, and several
others, including our police‘ car,
were damaged. This could hardly
be called good clean fun.

As for the matter of our training:
The Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania mandates a minimum of 480
hours of training for all police
ofﬁcers. All of our officers have

also very easy for your reporters to

whether your staff knows the true
meaning of “police brutality” and
what are the appropriate legal and
moral responses to police situa-,
tions. There is a scant choice of
responses to an unprovoked violent
attack. The violator has chosen the
response to his own crime.’

Police work. by its nature, is
reactive. Our job on this campus is
to protect the persons of the
university. This frequently means
that we must act to protect students
from each other. You frequently
commit either acts of violence or
gross inconsideration on your
fellow students. What we must,
consider is who is at fault? ,

suggest that if this student had
acted as a responsible person, this

incident would not have happened. '

Where does the blame lie?
Certainly not with the injured
officer, or with the officers who
effected a lawful arrest in the face
of resistance.

As journalists, reporters have a
responsibility to present the news
as they see~it—truthfully. In this
case you have not done so. The
Cohen article reflects bias. and
incomplete preparation. The
editorial is well off the point.

  ‘Tricky’ Hurley No ‘Treat’ for

  By MARIA SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

It’Ls Halloween, and all__ the little
orange men are'out on the prowl.

Syracuse, Orangemen are also
out to stir up some trouble this
weekend, when they invade Pitt
Stadium for a regionally televised
game. Because of the broadcast,

 . game time has been moved up to

_ 12:50 p.m.

'Saturday’s game will feature the
usually brilliant passing game of

7 Syracuse veteran quarterback Bill

Hurley. It was on a Halloween
afternoon four years ago that
Hurley’s total passing ‘output
totaled 303 yards, overshadowing

Tony Dorsett’s usual. outstanding ,

performance—no easy feat.

After missing last season with

some rib problems, Hurley is in his '

fifth year at _ Syracuse and
Orangemen’s scoring consistency
has been impressive. Games of 52
and 54 points against Washington
State‘ and Northwestern, plus 45
points against Kansas, point to a
busy afternoon this weekend for
the Panther defense.

PHILADELPHIA —— Philadelphia

I Eagles’ fans are in shock.

The Eagles, after five consecu-
.tive triumphs and a 6-1 record,
have been embarrassed two weeks

in a row. ‘

In fact, the team looked so bad
being trampled by Washinton and
Cincinnati, they reminded one of

, the National Football League
doormats before Dick Vermeil
became head coach in 1976.

The burning question among pro
football fans here is, what’s wrong
with the Eagles?

Perhaps it can best be summed
by saying too much was expected of

players of so-called star quality.

Vermeil wasn’t looking for an

He simply realized that from the
standpoint of talent, the Eagles
were several years away from

challenging the big boys in the
league.

The coach described his team as
a solid squad that could play, but
cautioned that there wasn’t a team
on the schedule the Eagles could
claim as a win. ‘

“We’ve gained respect, and
there isn't a team on the schedule
who can look at us and claim a
win either,” Vermeil said. “We’re
going in the right direction. But
we’re not there yet.”

The one bonaﬁde star in the
Eagles constellation was linebacker
Bill Bergey. He went down for the
season three weeks ago with a knee
injury. The defense is just starting
to feel his absence. The offense

hinged on quarterback Ron Jawor-

ski, running back Wilbert Mont-
gomery ‘and receivers Harold
Carmichael and Keith Krepfle.

Jaworski is a six-year NFL
veteran, but a starter only the last
three years. He’s. still learning.
Montgomery gained 1,220 yards
last year, his second in the league.
He’s injury and fumble prone.

up their ends.

“Syracuse will bethe toughtest
test so far for ouridefense,” said
defensive coordinator Foge Fazio.
“They can run and they can
throw. They have put a lot of
points on the board...” -

The Pitt defense won’t be the
only unit facing a test. Enter
freshman quarterback Dan Marino,
making his first collegiate start. So
far this season, the Central
Catholic graduate has complete 49
of 77 passes for 555 yards. He is
averaging 6.36, yards a toss,
including four touchdown throws.

Trivia buffs ‘will note (the
comparisons are always inevitable)

1975.‘

Panther-Orangemen matchups
have been close in recent times,
although Pitt has won every game
since 1973. The past‘, three Pitt
wins have been achieved in
come-from-behind fashion.

/ Last season, the Panthers scored
11 points in the fourth quarter to
nip Syracuse, 18-17. Pitt had to
rely on Mark Schubert to kick a
28-yard field goal with three
minutes left to play. This season,
besides Hurley, the 5-3 Orangemen
will field senior flanker Art Monk,
a ﬂashy runner, and sophomore
halfback Joe Morris, who gained
over 1000 yards in 1978-79.

Moving from defensive fullback
to offensive midﬁelder is quite a
task for a soccer player.‘ Especially
for a player who has played and
excelled defensively for many
years. But such a move was made
this year when Leo Bemis, Pitt
soccer coach, elected to switch
Danny Hamm to the midﬁeld.
soccer

Hamm, a sever-year

ffieran in Western Pennsylvania, ,

was fortunate "to have a strong high
school background in the sport.

‘While soccer is just now gaining

popularity throughout the Pitts-
burgh area, it is long-established in
North Hills, Hamm’s hometown.
His experience may have made it

easier for him to adapt to his new
position.

Hamm played his high school
hall at North Allegheny under the
expert direction of Bruno Schwartz.
He credits Schwartz with teaching
him the fundamentals.

“I learned so much from being
under Bruno for those three years
at high school,” said Hamm. “He
taught me everything I know about
playing soccer.” _

When Hamm decided to attend
Pitt and play soccer, he was
accompanied by two former team-
mates, Jerry Buirge" and Tom

Liebenguth. He has played with
Buirge (the two were co-captains
their senior year at North Alle-
gheny) for three seasons and the
past two with Liebenguth. Already

knowing how :these two play has
assisted Hamm on the ﬁeld.

“After playing with guys in high
school, it’s a lot easier to know
what to expect from them when you
play ‘together again in college,”
said Hamm. ,“You are able to
understand their type of play better
and are able to anticipate what they
will do on the ﬁeld.

“It also helped in my move to the
midﬁeld because Tom is on defense
behind me and Jerry is on the front
line in front of me,” added Hamm.
“Being between them has assisted
me in’ my switch.” ‘

In his senior year at North
Allegheny, Hamm made a name for
himself in Western Pennsylvania
soccer. His team went to the state
championships for the second year
in a row and Hamm was essential’
in _ bringing the team so far.
Individually, he was named to the
all-state team plus the All-WPIAL
squad.'He also was honored as the
No. 1 soccer player in the WPIAL,
receiving the award over former
Panther teammate Johnny O'Hara,
who has since turned professional.

Hamm has spent 1979 adjusting
to his new position as Panther
midﬁelder.
Panther win over Edinboro, he
scored the first goal of his college
career. ’

Coach Bemis hopes to see a lot
tnore scoring from Hamm next
season. -

“Danny hasdone a good job in
his switch to the midﬁeld,” said
Bemis. “He hasn’t developed
offensively as much as we had
thought he would, but neither have
a number of the players this year.
His strength is defense, where he
has a lot of experience. We look
forward to his play next season,
though, because I think that by

Booters' Hamm Searching for Keyto Offensive Switch

Hamm thinks Pitt will defeat
Gannon, although he says the

game should not be taken too_

lightly.
“We know that we beat them by

a 9-0 score last year, and they have '

only won one game so far this year,
but that doesn’t mean that we can

just blow them off like they’re 

nothing,” said Hamm. “They beat
Edinboro 3-2, and we beat the
same team 2-1, which can show
how this game could be close.”

Hamm added, “We know we
need to winthe rest of our games‘,
and after last week's contests-, a

win at Gannon would be a big

morale booster.”

Pitt News Staff Writer ~

In the past week, the Pitt ﬁel
hockey team has been desperately
searching for a victory. It travelled
north to face Kent State, east to vie
with Bucknell, then returned home
to meet Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, and is still looking
for a victory. The winning touch
eluded the Pantherettes every time

h as their record fell to 3-7.‘

Kent State dealt Pitt a 2-1 loss in
the cold northern weather of Ohio.
All the scoring took place in the
ﬁrst half, as Phyllis Campbell
answered Kent State’s two ‘goals
with a slapshot after 25 minutes of
play. .
remained intact due to the ﬁne

\ defensive play of both teams.

Pitt could not score at all against
Bucknell, and became‘ the victims
of a 3-0. game. Bucknell, a strong
Eastern team and regional con-
tender, thwarted all attempts by
theiPantherettes to put any kind of
a score on the board.‘ ’

“It‘was a good game moving-
wise, but we just couldn’t score. It
was really frustrating,” said Coach
A.-udrey Gerginski.

' It was -the, same story for the
Indiana match, as Pitt was held

score was 2-0, as Pitt missed at
least two prime opportunities to
score in the second half. With the
halftime score deadlocked "at 0-0,
Indiana came roaring back to score
twice in the second half.

Gerginski seemed baffled at the
Pantherette’s inability to score in
the last few/matches. .

“We are moving well as a
team,” she said, “but we seem to
die once we get in the circle.” .

The coach said she felt Yolanda

Ringgold stepped in to replace the
injured Colleen‘ Ahern at Kent
State, and has continued to deny-

"various assualts on the goal.

Val Lindahl is also held in high

“This is Val’s ﬁrst year as a field

Ebony ashion   Fair ts tyle For The 80’s ..

By DAVID E. STUBBS

Ebony Fashion Fair
A Color Explosion
Heinz Hall

October 23, 1979

On Tuesday.. Oct.’ 23. Pittsburgh
fashion buffs were entertained with a
wonderful evening of fashion; the world
famous Ebony Fashion Fair. The show
featured original creations by nearly
every noted American. British, French.
and Italian designer. High fashion, like
any other high art form. can tend to be
much too intricate. expensive and overall
esoteric. But. the Ebony Fashion Fair
exhibited a new trend among modern
designers: stylish practicability. This is
not to say the fashions will be more
affordable. but at least you could imagine
real people wearing the clothing. .The
Heinz Hall presentation was a two-part.
nine segment extravaganza which mar-
veled with color and taste.

M The fair began with “Kaleidoscope Fall
'79." a lavish array of color which
immediately set the tempo for the
evening. Kaleidoscope was followed by
"Get Up and Grow." which featured a
very free assortment of sportswear. Scene
Ill. “What Color Suits You." was a bright
assortment of day wear which exploded
with tints of purple. red. and green done

,in breathtaking combinations of'silk.

velvet and satin. ‘Cameras and photo-
graphers exploded with excitement as the
audience saw with their own eyes that the
’80s would present a vibrant new era to
international fashion.
evening focused toward swirling dresses
and thigh slit dresses. The tempo
mellowed as the fair entered Scene IV, a
segment titled “Moody Blues” which
featured many kinds of Autumn toned
evening and lounge wear for those
comfortable evenings, at home with
friends or guests. The first part of the fair

ended with "Nighttime Sizzlers.” a
segment sporting all types of sparkling,
glittering, tight, ﬂashy, and overall
exciting dance wear. This segment. as
with the rest of the program. was
perfectly staged and directed for just the
right effect.

The program was commentated by the
beautiful Shayla Simpson. a former
NBC-TV public relations manager and
Pan American airlines agent from
Washington DC.’ Her distinct knack for
commentating fashion must be seen to be
enjoyed.

A very important part of the entire
evening was the music of Dave Rivera.
Arranged and directed by Rivera. and
performed by the Dave Rivera Trio. the
music sets the exact mood. rhythm and
tempo for the ‘models. audience. and
commentator. ShaylaSimpson blends so
well with the music that at times it seems:
she might start singing. , -

The trend of the /5

" .Libe,rty.area'.-A _

The second part of the program started
.with “Fun in the Sun.” 'a collection of
“eye-catching" swimwear. The assort-
ment proved that one can be 97% naked
and still be eloquently styled. Scene Vll.
called “Am I ’Blue—Electric Too,”
contained cocktail or early evening wear

»which featured many different types of

gowns. dresses, and accessories laid back
in black. grey. autumn tans. and blue.
For all those who consider black a dead
color. the Fashion Fair showed once again
that it's very much alive.

Mixtures played an important role in
the program, such as mixtures of color.
mixtures of material and. of course.
mixtures of style. Scene Vlll. “A Color
Explosion." set the atmosphere for the
climax of the show. The music was
uptempo and building as the models
showed it is better to save-the best for
last. As each model appeared. they
remained on stage boasting theilatest
from such featured designers as. Bill
Blass. Pierre Cardin. and Christian Dior.
As the scene continued to buildgdown to
the last model, the stage was set for the
traditional fashion show ending wedding
scene. here called “Golden Glow."

The Ebony Fashion Fair is a production
of Ebony magazine and has been spon-
sored by prestigious civic and social
organizations throughout its 22 year
existence. The fair appears for the
beneﬁt of charity. this year's being the

SHOWCASE on

 .Movies/ Iheater

By MARK HOLAN

The Floating , Theatre successfully
ended the month of October this past
weekend with Theatre X’s production of
“Schmaltz.” An extra performance was
added Saturday night to accomodate
zealous theatre/cabaret-goers.

Operating out of the Student Union
Ballroom, Floating Theatre, in cooper-
ation with P.U.P.C., out-did themselves
with a delightful cabaret setting which
featured candles and tableclothes plus a
wholesome array of food which included
cheeses, vegetables, chicken spread,

onion dip, crackers, pretzels and punch. I '

“Schmaltz,” seven scattered years in
the life of cabaret blues singer Helen
Morgan featured ten original songs, a
tap dance and a fire baton act (from which
Morgan was dubbed “the torch singer”).
Kathryn Cornell’s voice was very
impressive as Morgan ‘and John
Schneider, as Morgan's manager Arthur,
was good at the tap dance.

The house band; Mark Van Hecke on

 piano, Mitchell Covic on bass and Victor

DeLorenzo as the young Joseph Cotton on
drums, was musically only adequate.
However, the trio nicely enhanced the
songs and also the atmosphere of the
cabaret. ’

November begins tomorrow night with
Pitt. Theatre’s season opener “Major
Barbara.” The George Bernard Shaw
comedy will run at the Stephen Foster

‘ Memorial and is being directed by
- Kathleen George.

  Theater Events Around Town

“I am thrilled to be working on Shaw
again,” said George who directed “Arms
And The Man” a few years ago. “He
writes with a kind of energy and spirit
that celebrates life. “Major Barbara” is
exhilarating.” -

During the intermissions of “Major
Barbara,” British Music Hall and Pitt
Music Hall will perform such song
favorites as “Knocked ’Em In The Old

Kent Road” and “I Do Like. to.be Beside ‘

the Seaside.”

'Rosemary Meyerjack will play Maggi in
Characters East production of “The
Shadow Box,” opening on Friday at the

Hellenic Cultural. Center in Forrest Hills. A
Meyerjack is a secretary in Pitt’s School
of Education and also a Speech/Com-
munication under-graduate student. She
appeared last year in Leon Katz’s “A
Death In Astapovo” and has hadvarious
supporting roles‘ at the Studio Theater
and Pittsburgh Playhouse.

Soho Repetoire Company, Pittsburgh’s
newest theater company, will debut on
Thursday.-November 8 at Pitt’s Studio
Theater with ‘‘Equus.’’ '

The company was formed in September
by member_s of the Red Barn theater and
the Studio Theater. John Gardner, who
directed the"‘Fantastiks” this spring for
Pitt’s Mainstage, is the‘ founder of the
new company. Soho Repetoire is
currently in the process of negotiating to
obtain Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater’s
space which was vacated in August when
the company folded.

Pittsburgh’s World Premiere:

Celebration for “The Fish”

, ‘By THOMAS PALMER

Come November 1st, the Steel City will
hit the movie marquees with the release
of the new ﬁlm, ,“The Fish That S_aved
Pittsburgh.” In‘ cooperation with the‘city

I of Pittsburgh, Lorimar Production’s new

sports comedy opens this Thursday" at the
Gateway with a festive first night of
activities. _

Area promoter, King’s Court manager
Herman Hartman forsees a good
reception for the film in Pittsburgh, -and
not only because it was a picture made in

this area. _
‘‘It_ probably would~still have the draw,

"because of ‘the basketball, and the

interest the people have here. But I think
it’s going to be a bigger event for the

people of Pittsburgh, since it was made .

here.” -

Hartman noted that the ticket sales for
the ﬁlm. which started just two weeks
ago, have been very good. Even for the

. premiere, which will be held here on

Thursday are going well at their $25 a
seat price. "
The festivities start with a fashion show

on the‘ Gateway Clipper by Gimbels,
along with champagne and a ‘chance to
mingle with some of the stars of the film.‘
From there, the party will procede along a
red carpet to the Gateway Theater for
some interviews with cast members, and
finally, the 8 o’clock World Premiere.

Despite the apathy of the people of
Pittsburgh» when the» initial shooting
began.’ last year, crowds picked up and
filled the arena',for the basketball
sequences. Hartman did not think that
this lack of interest would carry over and
hinder the film in its Pittsburgh stint.

At a first glance, “The Fish That Saved
Pittsburgh” has a chance of drawing‘ a
large amount of Pittsburgh film- goers. In
a big sports town like this one, with
people brought together by the cohesive-
ness of its winning teams, “Fish’s”
survival depends upon the film itself-
Local Pittsburgh businesses, in cooper-
ation with Hartman,. have helped give
the film a good start. How Pittsburgh
reacts to the outcome of this picture with
a, personal touch depends, upon the
audiences.

The Art Doctor Discusses His Professional

‘By JANICE SCHULER
The Art Doctor is a retired artistic
powerhouse. With an MFA"from

Carnegie-Mellon University and a BFA
from Penn State he has been immersed in
scholarship throughout his career.

He has taught art on all levels and has

shown his own work nationally. but now

prefers to affectionately pontiﬁcate about
art. He has been a constant voyeur of the

«art scene for over ten years. He is witty.

charming and occasionally reasonable in
his comments about art.’ _

In this interview, the'Art Doctortalks
about the International Exhibition at
Pittsburgh’s Museum of Art, the nature

of art school, some of the ‘common 4‘

illnesses found ‘in and around art, the
purpose of art and other lofty ideals. .

SHOWCASE: Doctor, what is the most;

C0mm0n problem with many of . the
paintings you see today?- , .
ART DOCTOR: Their values are all mixed
up. They often have high hue. pressure,
they’re very intense. And worst of all,

‘ they make pigments out of themselves.

SHOWCASE: What do you prescribe in
cases like this? ' _

ART DOCTOR: Massive doses of candor.
SHOWCASE: What about bullshit?

ART DOCTOR: What about bullshit?

SHOWCASE: Is it necessary, when

talking -about ,art_? ‘ ' I

I ART DOCTOR: Bullshit-runs"theworld.' .

 

The best illustration of bullshit is in
Salvador "Dali, Not only is he a decent
painter, but he walks an aardvark.’ , So
where do you go from there? There are
artists who think that is buffoonery, and

October 25, 1979

“I want to see the bleedin’----who just
threw " that bottle after the show,”
screamed an absolutely livid Ian
Anderson Thursday night at the Civic

"Arena. ” I want to meet the----face to face
and I'll show him what I think of him and
his bottle. I'll beat his bleedin’, head in
with it.”

Anderson, the 32 year-old leader and
chief singer/songwriter for veteran
British rock group Jethro Tull was made
as hell at the beginning of the band’s set '
and he had every right to be.

Three minutes before Tull went on ,
their road manager came out and made a
request on behalf of the band, that people
refrain from throwing anything onstage
while the band performed. Just two

, weeks earlier, Anderson had been hit in

the face with a whiskey bottle, nearly
losing an eye and forcing the group to
cancel several concerts.

But no sooner had Tull taken the stage
Thursday night at a near capacity Civic
Arena when some dim bulb wailed a

‘ Encore II

By PHIL CONTES

Jimmy McGriff
The Encore II
October 25, 1979

I Jimmy McGriff, one of the jazz world's
most innovative musicians, is noted for
his experimental endeavors with music.
In a continuation of the Encore II’s *
(downtown) series of major bookings,
McGriff appeared with his quartet which
surprisingly contained an organ, an
instrument not usually contained in jazz
bands’ repertoire.

On'Thursday night the spotlight was on
McGriff and his band whom played two
shows nightly from Tuesday through last
Saturday. '

The sets were long, consisting of
McGriff’s arrangement of some classic
numbers such as “Won’t. You Come
Home Bill Bailey” and more modern

numbers including some selections from _

McGriff’s recent album “Tailgunner.”
The mix of songs kept the enthusiam of
the audience growing. McGriff moved
through various genres of jazz, from
bouncy, swinging songs to hard bop, from
very mellow blues to some funk and
fusion.

bottle high in the stagefleft section of the.
Arena, just missing Anderson’s head

landing beyond his feet and splatteringi

all all over the stage.
Yes Anderson was mad, so mad in fact

_that he stopped the show at the

completion of the evening’s first song,
and actually seemed as if he was going up
into the seats and get the idiotic rotter

' himself.

Once the culprit had been removed
some ﬁve minutes later, Anderson and
the rest of Tull settled down- and
performed a first rate two hours of their
patented blend of unique folk themes
coupled with dramatic, intense and very
British acoustic and electric rock.

As always, Tull was tight as a miser.’ s
fist, and the unfortunate bottle-throwing
incident aside, played long and hard for
the appreciative Pittsburgh crowd, this
being one of Tull’s most loyal cities.

Led as always by that one-of-a-‘kind
showman, the heavily bearded and deep
voiced Anderson, Tull were dressed like
Pirates with the stage done up in ship-like
rope rigging to coincide with the maritime
theme running through their new album
‘ ‘ Stormwatch’ ’ .

In fact, six of the songs from
“Stormwatch” were what the band

—Ian Anderson of Jethro’Tu||

played for the first thirty minutes of their

‘set, before reaching ’back for a
representative sampling of the better - '

known material from their past 14
albums-’. _

"‘Too Old Too Rock’n’Roll:

Pittsburgh is in for a treat with the performancs of ktcz,

acclaimed Polish jazz pianist, at the Encore II, beginning November 7th.

“an artist of unique

Tatum, Keith Jarret, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson and'Herbie Hancock.
That's very high caliber, and his performances promise to be something

no jazz-lover should miss.

‘You Want Me Here,”

 

McGriff excelled throughout, soloing
on organ, and adding embellishments
with .the Fender Rhodes. His work on the
organ was compelling and varied, going
from driving rhythms to‘soft melodic
interludes often culminating in, chord
patterns so powerfulthat you could reei
the vibrations deep within.

His sidemen consistently stood out.
especially on some thundering drum and

conga duets. and on guitar in “On

Broadway." which was every bit as tasty

-as George Benson's version.

McGriff and his band were enthusias-

receptive but smaller than expected
audience.

national acts into its-~intimate' setting. '

The Encore II is to be

ement Crowd

“Heavy Horses,” “Songs from the
Woods,” “Minstrel in the Gallery,”
Too Young-
Too Die,” “Bouree—God Rest Ye Merry
Gentleman,” “Thick as a Brick” and of
course the “Aqualung” selections,”
“Aqualung,” “Cross-Eyed Mary” and
an unbelievably powerful and loud
“Locomotive Breath,” featured the
well-meshed performances of Andersgg-
and the rest of this tight and musically‘
polished band. The current Tull lineup

consists of drummer Barriemore Barlow, '

new bassist David Pegg (formerly with
Fairport Convention), guitarist Martin
Barre, John Evan on keyboards, piano
and synthesizers, and David Palmer on
portative" pipe organ and orchestral
keyboards. '
Anderson, one of rock's premier
performers, had the crowd in his corner
«all night with his fanatical electric ﬂute,
powerful acoustic guitar work, distin-
guished vocals and crisp phrasing.
His well choreographed spins and
whimsical charading with his hands were

in perfect synch with the band’s intricate ‘lg

musical arrangements. .
This was theninth time Jethro Tull has_
been in concert in Pittsburgh and their
professionalism, musical abilities and
love of performing, even after _ten years,
enabled them to attract an enthusiastic

- crowd. ~

Opening for Tull was UK,'a relatively
new group made up of three _of the finest
musicians from the progressive rock field.
UK is Eddie Jobson (Formerly of Roxy
Music and Frank Zappa) on keyboards
and electric violin, John Wetton (Family,
King Crimson, Roxy Music and Uriah
Heep) on bass and lead vocals and Terry
Bozzio (Frank. Zappa) on drums.

With the commercial demise of

Emerson, Lake and Palmer, UK seems to 

be trying to fill the void created by ELP’s
recent low proﬁle. ’ ‘

As musicians, the band showed
individually and collectively they had the
chops, delivering a 50-minute set of
hardhitting and loud progressive rock,
ﬁlled with interesting and challenging
time changes. ‘ ‘

“Caesar’s Palace Blues,” “As Long as
“Rendevous
602,3’ “Night After Night” and “In the
Dead of Night” were impressive
instrumentally.

J obson played interesting melody lines
on. both keyboards and electric ﬂute.

Wetton is a powerful and deft bassist, _‘\

‘Q

and Bozzio, a thin man in stature is 7
probably one of the most‘ physical

drummers you'll every see (he crashes his
cymbals sometimes while standing up).

However, many of the songs UK
performed during their show seemed like
long fusion jams since Wetton’s voice,
not, overwhelmingly clear, was often
b.uried beneath the thunderous instru-
mental attack. / L

UK needs a stronger vocalist to
compliment what is already a creative and
impressive instrumental line-up; Jethro
Tull just needs some friendlier audiences.

The Police in a word, are unique. While
many artists have experimented with‘
Reggae in their music. the Police are one
of the relatively few white bands who
have committed themselves to integrat- .
mg Reggae into their overall style.

What’s even more interesting is that
this sound has been commercially

along on its coat-tails. Further, the new
album “Reggatta De Blanc” and its
companion single “Message In A Bottle"
scored simultaneous number ones in
Great Britain. Finally. in the U.S..
“Reggatta De Blanc" has been one of the
top add-ons in FM play-list action.
This time around, the Police have pres-
ented us with a more compact and
dynamic approach than on the first
album-. Where the first album tended to

more in keeping with the band's desire to
be an “improvising” band.

Lyrical sentiments are further develop-.

ed on “Reggatta De Blanc” over the first
album. Message In A Bottle” presents
us with a picture of human discovery

given an antheimic treatment that makes _

it the best song of the album. The band's
Sense of humor /is evident in “On Any
Other Day." a tale ab0ut‘a terminal iinx

“Walking On The Moon,” is the most
novel song on the album with its new
treatment of the Moon as a. romantic
symbol. /

So far the Police have presented them- _
selves as one of the crack bands for the»

Eighties. “Outlandos D’Amour” was
one of the more pleasant surprises of
1979. “Reggatta De Blane” is.a stronger

_ piece of music and keeps the pleasure

ﬂowing.

‘_ q _ Bread and Roses
i ‘ .Festival of Acoustic Music

\

By MARK HOLAN
and MARGERY MEYERS

1 Bread and Roses is a 'n‘on-proﬁt

,' I‘ organization which brings free live

entertainment into hospitals, prisons and
other institutions. It was founded in 1974

 by Mimi Farina (Joan Baez's sister) and
-. has averaged 30-40 institutional shows a

\

month, throughout Southern California.
George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, and Santana

I are among the performers who have

donated their time and talent.
- Although it remains regional, Bread

 ‘and Roses has helped spawn similar

, Bridgeton, New Jersey.

oganizations throughout the country,
including Rainbow’s End in Allentown,
Pennsylvania and Goodworks Music in

The First Annual Bread and Roses
Festival of Acoustic Music was held in

’ October 1977 at Berkley’s Greek Theater.

: Burke-Van Heusen classic.

The concert was recorded and has
recently been released as a two-record
set. An impressive line-up of musicians
(listed below) make up this unique beneﬁt
show which is not politically motivated,
like last. months M.U.S.E. (Musicians
United For Safe Energy) concert in New
York’s Madison Square Garden, nor
grossly hyped like George Harrison’s
Bangledesh concert/album.

“There is music that is more civilized
than what loud rock and roll has come to
represent,” says Farina. “There are
people who enjoy listening to lyrics, who
can respond cerebrally as‘ well as
viscerally, and who are receptive to a
voice and a guitar. This first festival
‘proved thatthat is absolutely true.”

The album is truely a celebration of

humanity and acoustic music. The
performers and their respective songs are
‘as follows:
l Jesse Colin Young, “Sugar Babe:”_
Young's voice is more suited to this type
of blues singing than to the music with
which he is generally associated. His
ﬁnger-picking is not very proficient, but
the delivery is enjoyable.

Dave ‘Von Ronk, “Swinging On a
Star:” A very dramatic version of the
Van Ronk’s
scratchy vocals and sound effects are
overtly amusing.

The Bread-and Roses Troupe: How many faces can you recognize?

Malvina Reynolds, “Little Boxesz” At
/age seventy eight, Malvina Reynolds is
the appropriate choice, to perform this
song. about the mundane order of our
society. She singswith a touch of suitable
weariness.

The John Herald Band, “Ramblin’
Jack EIIiot:” As John Herald forwams,
he does, indeed, forget about the meter of
this song", and muddles the lyrics. A
bluegrass band is required to chase the
leader, forever behind. . j '

Ramblin’ Jack Elliot, “San Francisco
Bay Bluesz” This is not to be missed. ’
Ramblin’ Jack has become a_ primary
inﬂuence in the folk world, notably with
Bob Dylan, as evident in the vocal
phrasings of this song. The slide guitar is
a nice addition. .

, Hoyt Axton, “Boney Fingers”. and
“EvangeIina:” .During some drunken
patter, Axton says, “This is really as
together as I’ve ever been,” and it seems
true. “Boney Fingers” is fa slow,
deliberate version with a tight arrange-
ment. The lovely melody of “Evan-
gelina” is "enhanced by understated

country and western instrumentation. '
Mickey Newbury, “Mabel Joy:”
Newbury’s froggy vocals slide in and out
‘of a beautifully picked tune. The desolate
theme of the song is in keeping with the
theme of the concert.
Dan Hicks, “I Got Minez”

Hicks is

good at ‘fast-talking bebop. The nasal
quality of his voice tends to fuzz over at
times, but on the whole it is a_ ﬁne
performance. , .

The Persuasions, “Just Another Night
With The Boys:” A major disappoint-
ment on this album. The harmonies that

made this group popular tend to drag, 
' usually off-key, and the preaching is

intolerable.
Buffy Sainte-Marie, “Universal Sol-

dier:” The hard, “ma”chine-'gun,vocals” ‘
' of Sainte-Marie are a little hard to take,

but the constant vibrato does emphasize
the importance of the lyrics.

Pete Seeger, “Sailing Down My
Golden River: Seeger’s voice and guitar
are in beautiful tune for this classic song
of journey and friendship.

, Maria Muldaur, “Walkin’ One and 3
-OnIy:”

Dan Hicks’ bebop song seems
tailor-made for Muldaur. Her voice, _a
good instrument, goes wild at the
slightest provokation from the rhythm
section.

Tom Paxton, “The Last Thing On My

Mind:” Paxton adds a pleasant dimen.-.

sion to the album with an invitation for
the audience to sing-along‘ during the
chorus. Surprisingly, the audience makes
a good back-up unit.

Jackson Browne and David Lindley,

“For Everyman;” This version is tired,.--

and the rhythm is not well-counted, but
the melody does much to carry them
through. Lind1ey’s harmony is unneces-
sary. *

Joan Baez, “There But For Fortune;”
Heroine of this concerts “folknicks”~ and
sister of Bread and Roses founder Mimi,

Farina, Baez sings directly to the inmates .

of the California prisons to which this
show was broadcast to.

Arlo Guthrie, “Al The Goose:” This is
the “sad but true” story of Guthrie’s
boyhood pet. He performed the song this
summer at the -Palace Theater in
Greensburg, Pa.. Unfortunatly, a minute
and a half of Guthrie on the piano‘ isn’t a
fair representation.

Country Joe McDonald, “Save_ The
Whales:” Like John Hall’s “Power,”
this tune has become. the theme song for a
popular protest movement.

Toni Brown and Terry Garwaithe,
“Beginning Tomorrowz” Poor arrange-
ment and worse singing. There isn’-t even
evidence of a melody.

Richie Havens, “What You Gonna Do
About‘Me?:” Everything you’d expect

'from‘Have‘ns; cliched protest lyrics, rapid

strumming on the guitar and, like at

~ Woodstock, a guitar mike that’s never

loud enough for Havens.
Boys Of The Lough, .
Guinness/Irish Reel:”

“General
This _song

humorously reinforces the stereotyped. .

image of the Irish as drinkers. Nice violin
on the reel that caps-off the song.

‘Finale [Everybody], “Just A Closer
Walk With Thee:” Complete chaos
detracts from the over-all effect of the
album. Independently, most’ of the
performers play well, but together, they

' are a mess. -

present. It gets back to wanting to be
insulted, to be shocked out of
complacency. I want something I look at
to focus on reality. Today everything
goes so fast, and it is all so confusing that
we welcome something that will give us a
clearer understanding.

SHOWCASE: So is that the purpose of
art?

ART DOCTOR: Well yes, but only partly,
it should be combined with beauty.
SHOWCASE: That sounds rather old-

I fashioned.

ART DOCTOR: Listen, beau/ty isn’t going
to go out of style. Information mixed with
beauty is a more complete experience.
SHOWCASE: What about this shocking
business? Should art be an escape? V
ART DOCTOR: It doesn’t have to be
exclusively that. It’s great how a still life
can come back—it has a very gentle way
of imparting information.

SHOWCASE: Aren’t still lifes generally I

passe?

ART DOCTOR: Hey, I wouldn’t hold
anything against a still life. Art doesn’t
have to drop its pants everytime you turn
around. _
SHOWCASE: How do you feel about New
York being the sacred capital of art?
ART DOCTOR: There was once a time
when I though all the secondary cities
would start to spring their own art stars
who would get reputations where they
lived, because things are so short-term.
But it appears that New York is the only
place that can sustain the current of
artistic ﬂow because it can afford to do it
whether it is happening or not. So now,
it’s just weathering the storn.

SHOWCASE: How would you respond to I

someone who goes into the Museum of
Modern Art in New York and sees the
latest show and says_“I don’t understand
this. You call this art?”

ART DOCTOR: I would say, sure I call
this art. it’s in the Museum of Modern
Art isn't it?

 

  Art Doctor cont...

SHOWCASE: What is the nature of art
criticism?

ART DOCTOR: It’sisomething like when
the pianist, Busoni was asked after he
heard a Paderewski concert, was he
good? And Busone said, “He’s good, but
he's no Paderewske.” _
SHOWCASE: What’s wrong with the
International exhibition at the Museum of
Art here in Pittsburgh?

ART DOCTOR: It is a non informative

' , show. When I saw that show I thought of

like the soupcans. Advertsing was the
furthest thing away from fine art and it
turned out to be the subject matter. So
people had to react, for or against it. It
divided people, you had to take a stance.
‘All powerful thin.gs are like that, they
force you to take stands, either like it or
not, you have -to respond. In the
International Exhibition, we don’t have
the opportunity to do this out of necessity.
That’s where the real information is
going on. It’s the ‘only kind-of show
possible to put on. Out of all the things
you can pick for a prestigious event.
retrospectives arethe best. We strive to
keep art alive that h-as already been
established. All our fears about thinking
nothing is going on in art today are
reinforced when we see a show like this.

talent. i
SHOWCASE: What about his sculptures

ART DOCTOR: What can you say about
all that bronze? ,

always goes formalistic, to some form
indicating that art is drawn into the muse
itself. That’s when art ‘starts talking
about itself.

Koonings. And you can relax, you’re

alright. but just watch your step in that,

guy, Chillida. '
SHOWCASE: What do you do about a
really sick painting?

ART DOCTOR: Shoot it.

SHOWCASE: Really?

ART DOCTOR: Figuratively speaking.

But with the terminal cases we pull the.
plug, but really, it’s no big deal. The sad- .

dest part is that a painting can only be so

doesn’t hurt anybody. A good one is nice

to see, but a bad painting cannot change I-

the world. I wouldn’t hold it against ‘a
bad painting. And one thing we should

try to remember, we should try to be as 1'

friendly as possible to the person‘ who
made that bad painting.

SHOWCASE: Where do you see most of H I.

your terminal cases?

ART DOCTOR: In banks. But I want to
say that it’s great that people want to
express themselves, it keeps them off the
streets, keeps them active, otherwise,
who could know what mischief they are
capable of?

SHOWCASE: Do you encourage art
students? .
ART DOCTOR: Yes, their student days
are valuable because they have the
opportunity to find out what art isn’t.
SHOWCASE: How can they do that?
ART DOCTOR: Keep their eyes open.
