Drink tax
running
up a tab

by Hayley Grgurich
Senior Stctﬁ’ Write/‘ and
Halyse Therese Domencic
For T/ye Pitt Newa

Dan Onorato has started
one heck of a bar fight. g

The Allegheny County
Chief Executive’s introduc-
tion of a 10 percent tax on
poured drinks has raised pric-
es, slashed tips and incited the
anger of local bar owners.

The tax is meant to offset
the cost of the Port Authority
ﬂeet, but bar owners are bear-
ing the brunt of the burden.

“You.don’t want to price
yourself out of the market,”
Gene Ney, owner of Gene’s
Place on Louisa Street in

Oakland, said, “but it makes‘

it more difficult to keep pric-
es low and do the right thing
when your resources are being
taxed.”

Ney is not alone‘ in strug-
gling to implement the tax
while still taking care of his
customers and staff.

“It’s' really affecting bar-
tenders and servers because
they’re the college students
and the ones who need the
money most to put bread on
the table. Boomerang’s is fa-
mous for its $1 Yuenglings.

’ Now servers are receiving 50

cent tips instead of $1 tips
because Yuenglings are now
$1.50,” Dale Popovich, a man-
ager at Boomerang’s on Forbes
Avenue, said. _

Tips are among the biggest
casualties of the tax, no matter
how it’s distributed, because
higher prices mean smaller
change. A

In the interest, of keep-
ing speedy service and even
prices, some bar owners have

From many of the stories cir-
culating among Pitt students, one
might get the impression that the
world of apartment rental is like
the Old West —— a constant strug-
gle for justice, fairness and peace
that blurs the line between right
and wrong, good and evil.

But those who run into prob-

of Maryland student newspaper, The
Diamondback, reported a signiﬁcant
upswing in the number of thefts from
UMD dining halls.

In a oneday test,-D UMD Dining
Services closely tracked the sales and
inventory of several popular items at

possibly morethan $200,000 ayear —

more than likely be served.

According to The Diamondback,

seriously and is considering installing

ing facility, no such analysis of the theft
situationhasbeen conducted, but some
Sodexho employees admit that theft in
the dining halls is a major concern

“The building was pretty dirty,

the building was dirtier than be-

When asked why Pitt has

“It’s not just ‘give people

self-registration is high on the

as early as October for spring

Ethanol from Corn not

by Keith Gillogly
For The Pitt Newu

Fossil fuels are becoming extinct.
And if the earth really is getting
hotter, mankind’s use of fossil fuels is
definitely in the running as a possible
cause.

Amy Landis, an assistant professor

"in Pitt’s department of Civil and

Environmental Engineering, agrees that
fossil fuel use has gotten out of hand.
“Gas prices are over $100 a barrel,

‘which is huge. It’s not sustainable

from an economic or an environmental
standpoint,” Landis said.

Landis advocates the use of biofuels
made from biomass, or plant matter, as
a potential alternative to fossil fuels.

An avid researcher in the field
of biofuels, Landis spoke yesterday

' in Thaw Hall about the development

and future of biofuels in her lecture
titled “The Environmental Impacts and
Tradeoffs of Biofuels.”

Of the types of biofuels, ethanol
is perhaps the most well known. To
produce ethanol, corn starches are
fermented into sugars.

Although Landis said that the
United States has the technological
capabilities to make ethanol on a large
scale, environmental reasons have
encouraged scientists not to do so.

Growing corn for ethanol requires
large amounts
pesticides, but fertilizers are derived
from petroleum and pesticides from
natural gas.

Furthermore, large scale harvesting
of corn would add considerable amounts
of nitrogen to the air, a side effect
that agriculture has already begun to
experience.

“The nitrogen cycle has experienced
changes, too. We’ve moved the nitrogen
cycle in the U.S. to an unbalanced
state,” Landis said.

With some similar _capabilities to

of fertilizer and .

the answer, prof says

carbon dioxide, a main ingredient of -

global warming, nitrogen plays a role
in.smog formation, acid rain and even
respiratory problems.

It also adds to global warming,
meaning that carbon dioxide is not the
sole perpetrator.

All in all, ethanol is not the miracle
fossil fuel replacement. Landis advised
researchers to “move away from corn,
and‘ start looking at more feasible
crops.”

Some other biofuels have shown
more promise than corn, but further
research is still necessary. Switch grass,
for example, is a prominent energy
source, but has its own hindrances.

Switch grass has a higher degree
of sustainability, or environmental
friendliness, but technology to cultivate
the biofuel on a high degree is lacking.

Soybeans, another potential

biofuel, are commendable because of V

the ability of the plantmaterial to hold
in its carbon dioxide and keep it from
being emitted.

But considerable research and
development related to soybean
biofuels has not yet been done, Landis
said. .

Biofuels can come from a range of
plant material, even algae, yet few have
proven to be environmentally friendly
and efficient.

“Just because it’s green and comes
from a living thing doesn’t mean that
it’s environmentally friendly,” Landis
said.

Landis’ presentation was part of‘

a continuing series of lectures given
by Pitt’s Department of Geology and
Planetary Science. -

The lecturers primarily represent
various colleges and universities. All of
the presentations deal with geological

and environmental issues. A list of the ,

remaining lectures can be found on The
Department of Geology and Planetary
Science’s website.

Barmen claim beer distributors have an unfair edge

Drink tax, page 1

elected to raise prices 25 cents across
the board, while others have tacked
on the 10 percent to preexisting drink
prices.

“Some places have gone ahead -and
changed their registers to ring up the
10 percent, but people get annoyed
with nickels and dimes,” Jay Masood,
assistant manager of Spice Cafe, on At-
wood Street, said.

“If they buy a $1 beer with a lot of
tax, they don’t want to end up getting
90 cents back in change.”

Beyond the difficulties of applying
the tax to their menus, bar owners also
have to compete with beer distributors,
to whom the tax does not apply.

Although it’s worded to be a tax on
poured drinks, in reality it applies to
any alcohol a bar sells, including six-
and l2—packs.

“Six-pack sales have dropped only
two weeks into the new semester, espe-
cially when you are two to three blocks
from a beer distributor,” Popovich
said.

Ney is concerned that the competi-
tion could be stacked in the beer dis-
tributors’ favor.

“A piece of legislation they’re look-
ing at would allow beer distributors to
sell beer in smaller quantities like six-
and l2—packs, and they wouldn’t have
to include the tax, so that puts them at
a clear advantage,” Ney said.

Bar owners feel the tax has added to

intended to fund.
“They’re taxing people who go out
and drink for Port Authority, but pub-

lic transportation isn’t available after "

12:45 p.m. So, when people are done
drinking at 2 a.m., there aren’t any bus-
es. I feel it pushes more people to drink

the strain of the rising ‘ ‘
operating costs.

Because of a hops
shortage, breweries
have doubled their
prices, which directly
affects bar owner prof-

ing the charge the “Onorato Tax” on re-

to take a proactive stance against what
they consider unfair taxation.

Area bar owners together with

Taxation have organized a rally to raise
funds for a legal team to combat the
tax. '

for FACT, said. “It will be a celebration
of the industry and a fundraiser.”

The $40-a-head ticket price will
cover all-you-can—eat food, beer and
cocktails, most of which are being do-
nated by area businesses.

FACT was organized specifically
to combat the tax by restaurateur Torn
Baron, president of Big Burrito Res-
taurant Group, which owns Oakland’s
Mad Mex.

“I think we have a very good chance
of getting this tax repealed,” Burch-
field said. “What we’re seeing is a
greater understanding on the part of the
council members who voted for the tax

about just how much is affected when -

the industry doesn’t have the profits to
reinvest in the community.”

FACT has been pleading its case to
Onorato and the council, but bar own-
ers want to make sure that it does not
all happen behind the scenes.

“We want to keep this in the media,”
Popovich said. “We don’t want the
public to forget about it.”

other criteria like how many comput-
ers are available to all students (Pitt

Purdue uses a 35-year-old “home-

signs the days and times of the cours-

If a student is unhappy with the
selection, they have to go through a

and times.

According to Eric Gunnink, associ-

until this time, but because of its age
Purdue is in the process of upgrading
to the Banner system, which is also
used by Brown University and hun-
dreds of others, and it will be imple-

Robert Fitzgerald, senior associ-

students have always registered them-

selves.

“They used to do it on paper,” he
said, “until we installed Banner which
happened last year.”

Tenants must provide month'snotice if leaving early

Renters, page l

and the worst cockroach infestation he had
ever seen, Starun said.

He notiﬁed the landlord and gave the
company a week to ﬁx the problems.

According to the Pennsylvania Land-
lord—Tenant Law, landlords must repair
or replace those elements that are broken
when a tenant moves in and are responsible
for making repairs within a reasonable time
after being notiﬁed.

Starun had been documenting the hap-
penings since the ﬁrst day he moved in and
brought it to the city health department’s at-
tention, clairning the apartment was “unin-
habitable.”

“It is best for the tenant to not sign the
lease before any of the problems have been
ﬁxed,” Pitt law professor Dan Friedson said.
“If the tenant does sign it, then they get an-
noyed and hound the landlord, but once the
lease is signed, there is really nothing they
can do.” «

Under the law, the tenant has the right
to a habitable residence. Habitability means
that the apartment must meet minimal con-
struction, maintenance and safety standards
of the municipality having jurisdiction, ac-
cording to Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Off—Campus Liv-
ing website.

In Starun’s case, he decided to take mat-
ters into his own hands. “I realized early
that the situation would probably result in

. legal proceedings,” he said.

“When I felt like I-had enough cards in
my hand, I vacated the apartment, returned
my keys with a letter explaining why the
apartment was ‘uninhabitable,’ took the
things that I had already moved into it to
a storage unit, bombed the thing with all
kinds of pesticide and braced myself for a
lawsuit.”

Under Pennsylvania law, the tenant is
responsible for providing the landlord with
written notice at least a month prior to mov-
ing. When vacating an apartment, the tenant
must leave the property in the same condi-
tion he or she found it, return the keys and
provide a forwarding address for the secu-

rity deposit.

“When going to court it’s not what you
know, but what you show,” Friedson said.
‘_‘You need to have evidence and make a list
of any problems.”

The landlord sued Starun because he
failed to provide notice of his intent to va-
cate a month in advance.

But in October 2007, District Magistrate
Eugene Ricciardi ruled in favor of the de-
fendant, Starun.

Even though Starun did not provide
sufficient notice, the judge found that he
showed sufﬁcient evidence to support his
claim that the apartment was uninhabitable.

Ricciardi ordered the landlord to pay

January 25, 2008

Starun $271, including court costs.

Starun’s landlord did not respond to
multiple phone calls and e—mails asking for
a comment on the case.

Pitt sophomore Genevieve Redd ran into
legal issues when she decided to sublease
an apartment for this past semester. A

“Because I was a transfer student, I did
not get on-carnpus housing when I ﬁrst ap-
plied’, but I wanted to live on campus,” Redd
said. “I told my lessor that I wanted to try to
get on campus again and ifl couldn’t I was

 

going to move at the change of the semester
anyway.” _

When she returned to school earlier this
month after winter break and moved into
campus housing in Holland Hall, the lessor
informed Redd that she was still account-
able for the sublease since she had not found
"a replacement.

“If I couldn’t pay for the lease, I was
supposed to sublease the sublease until she
decided whether or not she could live with
that new roommate,” Redd said.

According to the Off—Campus Living
Ofﬁce’s website, a landlord must give the
tenant notice if he or she feels that the tenant
is violating the lease.

Redd did not provide her lessor with
written notice of her intention to move out
for the spring semester and had not returned

' her keys.

Under Pennsylvania law, the tenant must
have done both for the sublease to be legally
broken.

An e-mail alert on Chris Di1ger’s Black-
berry infonned him of the scholarship and

. woke him up at 6 a.m. Dilger read the mes-‘
‘ sage to discover that he won an award that

the Druids have given almost every year
since 1916. ’

Emily Rose gave both Dilger and War-
ren the call number of a book in the I-Iilhnan
Library..Dilger said the book was a 1939
yearbook ‘containing a page about the Dru-
ids, apparently before they were a secret or-
ganization. I .

“It was kind of like a mystery plot for
kids,” said Warren. _

Dilger said he knew about the scholar-
ship before he received it because a friend,
Andrew Ellis, had been researching the Dru-
ids. ‘

When Dilger called Ellis about receiving
the award, Ellis asked, “Was Iidreaming, or
did you say you got a scholarship from the
Druids?” I

But Dilger and Warren feel honored to
receive such a unique award.

’ “A lot .of what I heard is rumor, though
I think what they do around campus is very
noble,” said Warren. ‘”I‘hey’re committed to
the same values that the University is com-
mitted to, yet their individual members don’t

make a big deal of being recognized for their 
,. service.” A ' I 

Warren, a Pathﬁnder and chemistry teach-

. ing .”assistant who lives in the Civics Engage-

ment living-leamingi community, knew she
received the scholarship based on herservice
and academic standing at Pitt. But since she
“isn’t vocal” about her involvement at Pitt,
she felt surprised that the Druids picked her.‘

Dilger said that Emily Rose’s e—mail in-
fonned him that his “efforts had not gone un-
noticed,” and it commended his work with
emergency medical services. Dilger, a likely
biology major who skis, teaches CPR and
works as an EMT, founded a campus orga-
nization dedicated to providing emergency
medical service for students.

“I think it’s cool that they have secret
societies on campus that can go around and
give out scholarships,” said Dilger.

Emily. Rose could not be reached for
comment. -

No student named Emily Rose» is current-
ly enrolled at Pitt, although there is a gradu-
ate student named Emily Rosenberg.

The pseudonym is both a contemporary
TV actress and also a character in the 2005
horror ﬂick "The Exorcism of Emily Rose."

subleases refer to the original lease, mine

Redd took her case to the Off-Campus
Living Ofﬁce, who referred her to a law-
yer. '

“I had them look over [the sublease], and
they made sure I understood it, what itsays

She said she believed that most landlords

The dispute has not yet been resolved and
Redd’s sublessor did not respond to mul-
tiple e—mails asking for a comment.
Friedson said that those who are thinking of
taking a sublease shouldpkeep in mind that
signing on the dotted line means a lot in le-
gal terms. ‘

' “Once you sign the lease, you’re on the
line for the remainder of the lease, unless
it is unlivable. Once you sign, you’re stuck

The State of the Union,
eight years later

“Accountability is incredibly im-
portant for the school systems.
People shouldn’t fear account-
ability, they ought to welcome an
accountability system as a usejul
tool to make sure no child is leﬁ‘
behind.” — President Bush, 2002

“Our budget will run a deﬁcit that
will be small and short-term.” —
President Bush, 2002

“America sent you on a mission
to remove a grave threat and to
liberate an oppressed people,
and that mission has been ac-
complished. ” — President Bush to
U.S. troops, 2003

Here’s an education system in

poor shape, a sorely weakened.

economy, a never—ending and un-
reasonable War on Iraq.

Against this backdrop, Presi-
dent Bush will deliver his ﬁnal
State of the Union Address on
Monday. As his last and ofﬁcial
farewell, many look forward to
the speech as a celebratory event
signaling the end of an era of one
of the worst presidents in U.S.
history. For almost eight years,
the president has made promises
and broken them, purported facts
and been proven wrong, disen-
chanting the American people
and leading the country down a
disastrous road.

Recently, Bush secured a po-
litical, economic, cultural and
military agreement with the Iraqi
government. He also agreed to
give the House of Representa-
tives access to its wiretapping
documents to save telecommuni-

cations companies that aided the ‘

Bush administration in wiretap-
ping from civil lawsuits — all ef-
forts to make last—minute impacts
before he leaves office.

On Monday, President Bush
will undoubtedly make a ﬁnal
attempt to try and save. his al-

14

ready broken legacy. Through his
cringe-worthy “Bushisms,” the
president will make an effort to
push his economic stimulus pack-
age, and he will certainly empha-
size the growing threat that Iran
poses as a state sponsor of terror.

But during his term in ofﬁce,
the president has not proven to
us that he is a reliable and trust-
worthy leader. His last State of
the Union Address, like the ones
that preceded it, will be full of

empty promises. Unfortunately,
we have no reason to believe in

what he hasto say.

In many ways, Bush’s ﬁnal
address is irrelevant. As an es-
sentially lame duck president,
the most he can probably do is sit
in the Oval Ofﬁce and wait un-
til January 2009, when the next
president is sworn in.

We are, however, interested to
see how he will recall his years as
president. Will he paint a bright
picture of America today? Or
will he admit his past mistakes?
Will he address the promises that
he failed to keep? Will he try to
make his ﬁnal year as beneﬁcial
for the United States as possible?

And more importantly, how
will America remember this
president? When it comes to
Iraq, we see an unnecessary war
grounded in lies. When it comes
to children, we see an education
system that desperately needs
to be rebuilt from the ground
up and millions of kids without
health care. When it comes to the
economy, we see gross misman-
agement and a deﬁcit that keeps
growing. When it comes to the
environment, we see an inability
to take necessary action to com-
bat global warming.

The list goes on and on, only
showing that the State of the
Union is unhealthy and the presi-
dent’s legacy is not one to be
proud of. ~ ‘

Unemployed is the Way to live

     

by Molly Green
Colum/ziat

There are two groups of
people in this world: the em-
ployed ‘and those wily indi-
viduals who prefer the thrill of
living day-to—day, searching
the streets for money, stock-
piling Market Central apples
and oranges and constructing
elaborate mouse traps in back
alleys —- for food and enjoy-
ment! It’s a good life, and as
a long—standing unemployee,
it’s one I plan to protect.

Shockingly, there is a
growing underground group
of people —— I like to call them
the Job Snobs — who seek
to tarnish the good names of
the jobless. The Job Snobs
think that those without jobs
are different, and there is
no room for different in our
modern society. Because of
this, there are those who feel
that the Jobless Movement
must be stopped immediately
and at all costs.

One by one I’ve watched
my peers succumb to the Job
Snobs’ heavy fists of fury.

The Pitt'News O www.pittnews.com

One second they’re frolicking
happily in the sweet, grassy
meadows of unemployment,
and. the next second they’re
stuffed into aprons serving up

' eggs and grits to table four.

I had/a dear friend —- we’ll
call her Cookie — _who once
was much like I am: A young,
happy girl who had not a care
in the world except to decide
What kind of cheese she want-
ed on her macaroni.

Then Cookie was sucked
into the cold, cruel (world
of the service industry. She
traded in our joyous games
of Spud in the park for an ice
cream shop. So it came to be
that Cookie spent her morn-
ings, afternoons and evenings
selling various ﬂavors of cus-
tard and ceramic cat statues to
elderly women, small children
and one melancholy clown
who frequented the parlor.

Sadly, Cookie’s story is
just one of many. ’ Societal
pressures are turning more
and more to the job market at
terrifying rates. .

People without jobs are
being dubbed “lazy,” “worth-
less,” and little better than the

rats that we enjoy catching so
much. ,

And it’s not just a U.S.
trend. Many other countries
in the world are beginning to
blame their problems on the
unemployed.

Afghanistan_ is ‘blaming the
unemployed for its entire ille-
gal poppy market, according
to BBC News.

The UK — contrary to its
normal reputation ‘of being
filled to the brim with cheer-
ful, caringpfolk — has turned
the other cheek to those with-
out jobs. In a study conducted
by The Economist, 30 percent
of British citizens stated that
the unemployed population’s
“laziness or lack of willpower
got them where they are to-
day.”

The terrible accusations
continue, with Thomas Sei-
dler, a researcher at the Insti-
tute for Social 8: Economic
Research, actually blaming
unemployment for one of the
most petrifying and wide-
spread diseases of the 21st
century: right-wing extrem-
ism.

Quitting is nothing to be ashamed of

by Richard Brown

Cola/nniat

Sometimes it becomes clear
that a job just isn’t going to work
out. You might be moving, have a
conﬂict in your schedule or simply
don’t enjoy your co—workers or the
atmosphere of the workplace any
longer. In these cases, it just might
be time to turn in your two-week
notice and leave entirely.

Quitting is something that al-
most everyone who has had a job
has experienced. Whether it’s a
summer job and you’re leaving to
go back to school or simply can’t
handle your 18—credit workload on
top of three hours a week, almost
everyone has had to leave a job
behind. What isn’t as shared or as
easy, though, is dealing with the
different strategies and attitudes
that different people have toward

a quitting.

Some people see quitting as a
sign of weakness and will contin-
ue to slog on through hostile work
environments and the complete
loss of their personal lives in or-
der to never have to resign, or they
will take tremendous cutbacks in

their hours before admitting that

they might not be able to hang on
to the job. i V

What needs to be remembered ‘

is that jobs are not a competition,
but a way to. survive in the rest of
the world. We do work for people

in order toget money to survive,

not to prove to ourselves that we
are the absolute best secretaries
in the world and can take all the
sexual harassment the bosses want
to throw out. It’s not a race to see
who is the best or who can last the
longest but rather a way for you to
live.

Similarly, some people will
hang on to a job or be reticent to

 

leave because there’s no replace-
ment for them, and if they were to
quit the boss would be in a bind to
hire someone new.

I can attest that it’s hard to
leave a position you feel bad about
leaving, but again, remember that
a job is for you and you alone. It is
not an obligation to support your
employer in sickness and health,
’til death do you part.

It’s an agreement for them to
pay you for doing their work for
them. If you don’t want to do the
work, they stop paying you, and
that’s where your obligations end.
It might seem cruel and heartless,
but so is economics.

Many people seem to forget
that in almost every job in the
world, employment is conditional
on the part of both the employer
and the employee. This means that
if the boss has reason to ﬁre you,
they’re allowed to, but if you want
to quit for whatever reason you
want, you’re allowed to as well.
You don’t need an excuse or a rea-
son for leaving your job, just a de-
sire to leave. Trust me when I say
that if you were a good employee,
your boss won’t think any less of
you if you decide to move on.

Another common issue people
worry about is being able to ﬁnd
another job if they quit the one
they have. A good strategy is to
look for other jobs before you quit.
Especially when working full-
tirne, it’s always important to have
some sort of safety net to fall back
on. Setting up interviews on your
days off or ﬁlling out applications
in your off—hours is not “cheating”
your current employer. It’s mak-
ing sure that if and when you leave
your job you have something to
keep you ﬁnancially secure.

This could also relate to a spe-
cial savings account or fund to
keep you stable while job search-

‘certain that you will be able to

I about leaving your job is simply

_ giving you skills, resources and

ing, but this is not as safe a strat-
egy since it’s never 100 percent

start working before your money
runs out. When leaving a job it is
always best to play it as safe as
possible to make sure that you will
have enough money to survive un-
til you are able to get employment
somewhere else.

I And contrary to the beliefs of
many people, quitting your job is
not an end-all to the relationship.
If you just need a few months
off to go abroad, concentrate on
school or even go home for the
summer, most employers would
be willing to work with you so you
couldicome back to a stable posi-
tion when you were ready.

It’s always good. for them to
get a trained and capable em-
ployee back rather than having
to hire someone fresh, so always
keep your options open enough to
include a job that you might have
left in the past.

But probably the most irnpor—
tant piece of advicethat I can offer

this: Only do it for you. Just like
getting a job or going to college

are personal experiences based on

experience, quitting a job is a big

stepthat can have a lot of conse-
quences both positive and nega-
tive.

So just like you wouldn’t drop
out of college the ﬁrst time you got
a bad grade on a paper or because

-~ your girlfriend wanted you to,

don’t quit your job unless you’re
sure it’s what you want to do. It’s
your life, so make sure to stay em-
ployed the way you want to, not
the way you feel obligated to.

Ifyou have any good stories about
quitting your job, e-mail Richard

“Job Snobs"

sets that show a positive rela-
tionship between growing up
with unemployed parents and
right-wing extremism, indicat-
ing xenophobia in particular.

Germany is so ashamed
of its unemployed that it is
considering removing older
unemployed citizens from its
government unemployment
statistics, according to an As-
sociated Press news brief.

This is ridiculous! Every-
one knows that the root of all
our problems is the cow popu-
lation. They’re the ones that
need to go!

After all these attacks, I
feel the obligation to stick up
for my people here and ex-
plain why the unemployed are
not nations’ foes but instead
an entity that needs to be em-
braced.

Unemployed people are
eclectic. We like jumping
around from thing to thing.

During my rather lengthy
unemployment I was highly
involved with my community,
baked cookies for the elderly,
volunteered at the Pittsburgh
Zoo and watched an extremely
large quantity of television —
this is extremely important for

judgemental

reasons I can’t adequately ex-
plain in this column.

Many famous writers, mu-
sicians and artists were un-
employed. The Job Snobs’
propaganda tells us that this
is because those markets are
small and competitive.

But many of these same
writers, musicians and artists
become famous writing about
their experiences in the unem-
ployed world.

And what a sweet world it
is: no occupation tax, no boss-
es, no annoying co—workers,
no money — thus ensuring
that we don’t get sucked into
consumerism and the like;

The fact is we’re a great
group of people, unemploy-
ees. We go about our ways and
mind our own business. We
don’t judge people who have
jobs, so why should they judge
us? .

And that’s all I have to say
about that.

Upon hearing that you were
unemployed, has anyone ever
said, “Sir (or Madam), are
you selling opium on‘ the black
market?” If so, seek support
from Molly at mog4@pitt.edu.

This Sunday, ﬁve local bands will invade
the homes of Comcast customers around
Pittsburgh. But don’t worry, you can put
down the baseball bat. This Sunday’s Sonic
Funhouse Showcase at Mr. Smalls will be
ﬁlmed and made available on-demand to
watch right from your living room.

Tango, jazz, belly dancing and string
music will come together to create the sixth
showcase of The Sonic Funhouse Series.
Five of Pittsburgh’s most talented local
bands, selected from over 200 submissions
will take the stage this Sunday, I an. 27, each
bringing its own genre and style to the per-
formance. -

Though the previous ﬁve Sonic Fun-
house shows have all had a clear theme
to them, this week’s showcase, featuring
Ishtar, Ana-Vey, Phat Man Dee, Cellofourte

and La Bicicletta Blanca, shows no such
consistency.

According to Mr. Smalls Facility Man-
ager, Katie Smith, Sunday’s show is “full of
interesting and diverse music that doesn’t
quite ﬁt together. It’s really a little bit of ev-
erything?’ , .

Each of the ﬁve bands has its own va-
riety of music. From Cellofourte’s classical
training to Phat Man Dee’s experience per-

forming with Circus Ridiculous, all of Sun-
day’s performers come from backgrounds
as different as their music.
“The more diverse the bands, the better the
set. It keeps things more interesting,” said
Jack Hayes, Ana-Vey’s guitar, percussion
and banjo player.

The ﬁve very different bands will all
sync together Sunday, starting with Ishtar,

Think back to when your mom made
you take piano lessons. You groaned, put
-color—coded stickers on the keys, hunted
and pecked relentlessly. Years later, still not
a concert pianist, you’re learning to play
a piece like “Andante” or “Allegro in C,”
pieces that a 5-year-old wrote while sitting
up to a piano with feet dangling above the
pedals.

16

This can’t be right.

‘ It’s true — Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s
genius began at home with his father’s mu-
sical education and continued to ﬂourish,
entertaining the upper classes and rival-
ing other Classical musicians in 18th cen-
tury Austria. His life, mysterious death and
wily antagonist, fellow composer Antonio
Salieri, have come to Pittsburgh in “Ama-
deus,” previously a Tony award-winning
Broadway show. Mozart, a highly complex
man, deﬁned by his obnoxious laughter and
perverted jokes, is full of humor and sur-
prises. The envious Salieri is the ﬁrst to be
surprised, then appalled, as his reverence
for this prodigy swiftly turns to hatred upon
their meeting.

He did have his biases, though, so come
see for yourself. Stephen “Alex” Coleman,
who plays Baron van Swieten in the show

and is also a theatre professor at Pitt, said,

“No prior knowledge of the life of Mozart
is needed for the full understanding and en-
joyment of this play . . . I honestly think this
production is going to be one of the high-
lights of this year’s theatrical season.”

Pittsburgh Public Theater’s O’Reilly
Theater kicked off the show with a pre-
view on Jan. 24, but don’t miss discounted
tickets on Pitt Arts night, tonight. Student
tickets are available for $16 Friday with
faculty and staff tickets for $28, including a
pre-show dessert reception and a chance to
meet artistic director, Ted Pappas, and per-
forming cast members. Regular tickets will
be available for sale through wvvw.ppt.org
for Feb. 1 to 24 showings.

Amadeus is a Peter Shaffer production
based on the short~play Mozart and Salieri
by Russian writer Aleksander Pushkin.

Fashion

Cheap andfake
bags a fashion
faux pas? V

by Julia Nauer
For T be Pitt Ncwa

Being a typical young, broke college stu-
dent, I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to afford every fabulous
purse or bag that I want, or usually feel that
I absolutely need to have. And on a number
of occasions, I have drained my bank account
in a Coach boutique because I simply could
not have lived another day without that new
leather bag.

But being strapped for cash, combined
with a desire to have the latest trend leads a
number of people (and I’m also guilty of this)

' . to turn to fakes to satisfy their fashion crav-

ings. Whispers in New York and Washington,
D.C., call to you, “Prada! Fendi!” as they open
their garbage bags full of goodies. Sure, when
people ﬁnd out it’s a fake, your fashion cred
diminishes a bit, but no one really gets hurt,
right? You may be thinking: Designers are
already ridiculously wealthy, and I wouldn’t
buy the real thing anyway, so no one loses out.
Well, maybe not.

I never really gave much thought to coun-

terfeit bags until my senior year of high school ‘

when I had to do a project on copyright laws.
Copyright infringements in the recording
industry seemed so played out, and I had re-
cently become infatuated with clothing. So I
started to think about counterfeit clothing and
handbags. A few years back I had purchased
what I now consider to be a hideously tacky
pink counterfeit Coach handbag in Virginia
Beach. I really should call it “Goach” because
the ‘C’ logo had been changed to a ‘G.’ Need-
less to say, it was deﬁnitely not real leather.

I had another run in with fake bags when I
began to see a lot of people with a_ large color-
ful bag that sported an even larger zipper pull.
I just had to have it. When I went to.visit my
friend at George Washington University in
Washington, D.C., I was lured into a tiny crack
between two stores, and I walked away with a
bag adorned by a ridiculously sized zipper. It
sported a Doloe & Gabbana label. Yeah, right.
I immediately regretted this purchase consid-
ering when I opened it up it smelled like ﬁsh.
Gross. So I began to wonder if it was really
legal to sell something so similar to the real
thing.

It’s not. In fact, according to an article in
the January issue of Harper’s Bazaar, the mon-

an A&E feature by Colleen Seidel

It takes an earnest minute of studying
the mural on the side of Villa Reale Pizze-
ria at 628 Smithﬁeld St. before you realize
exactly whats going on in the picture.

“The Two Andys,” as it’s called, depicts
Andy Warhol and Andrew Carnegie sitting
side by side wearing plastic salon aprons
around their necks, their hair set under-
neath dome dryers. Warhol holds a maga-
zine and, for lack of a better term, a very
Warhol—esque expression, while Carnegie,
a titan of the steel industry, sits pleasantly
soaking his cuticles in solution.

The image, almost nonsensical, has no
apparent proper context — two larger-
than-life ﬁgures who lived in very different
worlds sit casually beside each other, their
hair in hot rollers.

“Andy Warhol and Andrew Carnegie,

Artist Katherine Young deviated from her pen-and-ink experience to paint the mural "Urban F|ora” for
the side of Doc's Place in Shadyside.

highly inﬂuential men whose legacies live
on in Pittsburgh, are receiving makeovers at
a beauty salon,” said Curt Gettman, project
coordinator at Sprout Public Art, the orga—
nization behind the mural. "It's meant to
convey a sense ofhumor regarding the idea
of [Downtown] revitalization.”

The mural is one of 38 currently spread
throughout Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County, and each is the result of a collab-
orative community effort spearheaded
by Sprout Public Art, a component of the
non-proﬁt organization, The Sprout Fund.

Sprout began its public art initiative
about ﬁve years ago, when Morton Brown
followed his wife to Pittsburgh in 2003.

“I had come from Philly, after having
worked with the Philadelphia mural arts

program," explains Brown, Sprout Public

Art’s original program coordinator. Brown
started asking around about public art in

Pittsburgh and was eventually pointed in

Sprout’s direction.

”With e;udorsem.erit and

help from members of
'Philadelplr:.ia’s prograin,
Brown said, the Sprout Fund

raised enough money to do

seven murals its ﬁr'st year.

“Sprout decided to take me on part-
time at ﬁrst, as sort of a pilot project," he
said. With endorsement and help from
members ofPhiladelphia's program, Brown
said, the Sprout Fund raised enough money
to do seven murals its first year.

One of those murals was “Listening
Through Time,” located at 2201 Wylie Ave.
in the Hill District. The mural is of a "saxo-
phonist  the streets of the Hill with
hope through music,” according to Sprouts
description. It features jazz legends Lena
Horne, George Benson and Art Blakey, all
musicians who have ties to the Hill Dis-
trict

Its location is signiﬁcant, too. Wylie
Avenue was once home to Crawford Grill,
a renowned jazz club from the I 9305 to the
1950s

"In that ﬁrst year, the-project went off

without a hitch," Brown said. Sprout Public .

Art now produces seven to eight murals
each year, according to Gettman, who took

over as program coordinator in 2007 when

Brown returned to Philadelphia.

Jordan Monahan's "Lend Me Your Ears” exudes a sense of child-like innocence, captivating East Liberty

viewers with its active subject.

There’s a process behind each'mural
that includes planning, design and produc-
tion, and it’s Sprout’s role to facilitate this

M process each year.

Communities apply to Sprout by the
end of March with their proposals for mu-
rals which include a 25 member-signed
petition and photos of the proposed mural
wall.

“Getting property ‘owners to agree to
a mural and all of the issues surrounding
their execution, permanence and upkeep is
sometimes a process that takes a good deal
of time to work out,” Gettman said.

“Building owners are not paid for the ‘

use of their walls," he added, "so, in a way,

it is only through their generosity that our

program is able to succeed.”

“We approve about 20 mural proposals

per year,” Gettman explained. “The board

selects eight based on criteria like the qual-
ity of the wall and what the impact or ben-
eﬁt to the communitywill be.”

After the eight proposals are selected,
Sprout ‘brainstorms with each community
towrite notes about what the community
wants represented in theimural.

Connect Greenﬁeld was 1 one such
community organization involved in
brainstorming ideas for its mural project in
Greenﬁeld Alison Oehler, a board mem-
ber of Connect Greenﬁeld, said the orga-
nizaﬁon went to the senior center, put up
voting boxes ir1 the neighborhoods PNC
branches and held brainstorming meetings

that _included many general community’

members. . -

"We had lots of really wonderﬁil input, '

most of which related to highlighting all
I of the ‘hidden treasures’ of the neighbor—
hood,” she said, referring to Greenﬁelds "in-

credible views of Downtown, the tight-knit p

community and beautiful landscaping.”
Once the community comes up with a
- general idea for the mural, then it’s time for
Sprout to match the community with an
artist. But thats a process, too. _
‘About 40 to 50 artists apply each year,”
Gettman said. "The artists compete, the

January 25, 2008

communities select.”

In early May, Sprout holds a preliminary

design exhibition with a handful of poten-

tial artists to present their ideas directly to
the community Sprout also has the artists
rank in order their choice of community
while each community does the same with
artists. .

‘By June the artist is chosen and the

~ design ﬁnished. Onceit gets ﬁnal approval,

the painting phase of the process begins.

Artist Jon Laidacker knows firsthand
the process of painting a Sprout-funded
community mural. In fact, he has done
two works with the program —— his ﬁrst in
2004, his second in 2006.

i“In all honesty, I got involved as a way
to stop pumping gas for a living," he said,
laughing. "I had just graduated from under-
grad [at Mansﬁeld College] with a degree
in studio arts, and pumping gas was about
as far as that got me. One day I was leaﬁng

through the classiﬁeds, and saw an ad for r

Sprout Public Art I never thought I would
be doing a mural." , I
Laidackers best—known work, at least
to Pitt students and Oaklanders, is the
mural on the side of the building located at
3609 Forbes Ave. Titled "Interpretations of

Oakland," it is a collage of images past and »

present of the neighborhood.

"There are ﬁve photographs that I
took myself of current-day Oakland going
around the perimeter. The center image is
a 1936 photo of the building that I painted,
and there is the PBS image of Fred Rogers,”
Laidacker said, detailing his work.

“I tried to pull a lot from my studio
work,” the artist explains of his inspiration
for the photorealistic piece. Although the
community provides brainstorming points,
he said, “the artists ideally morph our own
style around what the community facilita-
tors want”

“You can see the mural from the top of
the Cathedral,” said Georgia Petropoulos,
executive director of Oakland’s Business

, Improvement District, one of the commu-

nity organizations behind Oakland's mural.

When each mural is ﬁnished, it receives
an ofﬁcial dedication in a ceremony held
sometime in September or October. ‘

“They're basically outside parties,”
Gettman said.» For example, the Bloomﬁeld
mural completed this past summer was
dedicated coinciding with the 2007 Little
Italy Days. ‘

Another one of Sprout’s functions is
to fund each mural initiative it takes on.
Gettman estimates that each mural costs"
between $10,000 to $20,000 to produce

“The cost of the mural depends on the

A size of the mural. A larger building space

requires bigger equipment, which incur
rental costs like lifts," he explained.

The ﬁinding is provided by foundation-
al grants like that of the Laurel Foundation
and the PPG Industries Foundation, Gett-
man says.

_ Its a big pull forcommunities to get in-
volved with the project. According to Petro-
poulos, BID got involved because they had
wanted a mural in the neighborhood for
a long time and ﬁnally had a funder they
could take advantage oﬁ alluding to Sprout.

Brown added that most of the funding
in the early stages of the project was locally
provided, coming ﬁom “non—proﬁt philan-
thropic arms of corporations whose whole
mission was to give local artists the chance
to make an impact.” ' I
, ‘ IfKatherine Youngs encounter with a
pedestrian last summer while painting her
“Urban Flora” in Shadyside is any indica-
tion,.the murals are making quite an im-
pact. ,

Young, a painter by training who does
mostly  work in the studio, was
picked by Shadysides committee to paint
its mural on thelside of Docs Place at the
corner of ldellefonte and Walnut streets.

“People smiled a lot, said ‘thank you,"
she said, “but my favorite interaction was
with this lady who came up to me and said,
in a rather confrontational tone, '1 hate mu-
rals, but I like yours.”

‘And that meant a lot to me," the artist
reveals. “To have someone change their

opinion .because of something I did."

Youngs piece, like Laidackers, takes
a lot from her gallery work. The birds fea-
tured in her mural are silhouette drawings
from a 1930s ﬁeld guide, and she originally
laid out the design by drawing on the build-
ing with sidewalk chalk.

Painting a public art piece
takes on quite a different
stride than painting for a

gallery.

But despite any similarities, painting a
public art piece takes on quite a different
stride than painting for a gallery

"You have a plan going into it and then
you realize that plan doesn't really work,"
Young said about her ﬁrst experience with
mural painting. I

According to Sylvia Rhor, an art history
professor at Carlow University, public art

Layout design by Braque Hershberger.

 

Above: it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood when Oakland residents gaze up

can actually be “more organic and complex

» than gallery art.”

Another difference, Rhor added, is that
public art is encountered in everyday life,
and this increased exposure can build curi-
osity or interest among those who see it

Rhor’s class this spring will workwith
Sprout in detailing the community impact
of the murals they have placed thus far.

"One important aspect [of the murals]
is that it builds a public coalition. The pro-
cess can be more empowering than the fi-
nal product," she said. ‘

Laidacker echoes her sentiment: “I
think a public mural, a community-in-
formed mural, is one of the most socially
relevant artworks that can be produced"

In fact, Rhor sees Pittsburgh at a prime
right now for public art. As she said, "The
Sprout murals, because of sheer number
and their placement in various neighbor—
hoods throughout the city, have been key
inbringing a new awareness to the possi-

bilities of public art in Pittsburgh.”

gallery Crawl to liven

up Downtown tonight

by Jacob Spears
Staﬂ H7/‘lie/'

It’s usually a special occasion when

.Pittsburgh’s Downtown is stillpulsating

with human activity after dark. When
there’s an overabundance of tight jeans
and heavy, dark—rimmed glasses among
the crowds for the occasion, it’s more
than likely “Gallery Crawl.”

The free event is held once a sea-
son on Friday nights by the Pittsburgh
Cultural Trust to showcase a variety of
the galleries and cultural spaces around
the Penn and Liberty avenues area in
Downtown.

While some of Cultural T rust’s main
galleries are premiering new V exhib-
its tonight, places like Pennsylvania

“Can we interact with something

that’s essentially a machine [on an

emotional level]‘.7” Horne wonders.

At 812 Liberty Ave., Ed Parrish Jr.
put together “Hot Metal,” SPACE’s lat-
est exhibition.

“It’s essentially a wide variety of ap-
proaches to metal as a medium for the
creation of art,” said Parrish, who is the
gallery’s guest curator for the show.

A metal-based artist himself, Par-
rishput together an eclectic showcase
of seemingly disparate artists and
craftsman who really would never fall
into the samccategory artistically if it
Werenit for their shared use of the same
medium.

- “There is everything from a tradi-
tional blacksmith from Ukraine to a

Many of the ivenuesiwill have com-
plimentary food and drinks and some
live music, but, of course, there will
actually be some worthwhile exhibits
to check out.

Wood Street Galleries, located above
a Port-Authority T-station at 601 Wood
St., is premiering a collection of tech-
nologically chic artworks by several
artists in “Urban Living.” '

“‘Urban Living’ is about the issues
people confront when looking into the
immediate future,” according the Mur-
ray Horne, the galleries’ curator.

As Home described them, the art-
works deal with everything from arti-
ficial intelligence to genetic cloning to
the way we interact and communicate
with each other and the machines in our
world.

“They are sort of cute,” Horne said,

A describing Pascal Glissmann and.Mat—
ina Hofflin’s “Electronic Life Forms

[Elfs].” The “E1fs” are solar powered
analog circuits that interact with the
viewers. ‘

For as adorable as they may be,

‘ Horne also sees them as posing an in-

teresting question:

perform at SPACE
tonight.

“Totally Maybe: Works By Lady-

boy” also opens at 707 Penn Gallery.
It’s a solo exhibition of silk—screen
paintings, wall murals and ﬂuorescent
paint by a local -artist who prefers to

_ work under the moniker Ladyboy.

Next door, at 709 Penn Gallery,
“Celebrations of Life and Death is
West Africa,” a photography showcase
by Colter Harper, will also-be on dis-
play.

“[‘Gallery Crawl’] features artwork
you simply would not see in other cit-
ies,” said ‘Horne. And he’s right.

Artist group Information1ab’s “Cell
Phone Disco,” which interacts with
cell phone airwaves, may make Wood

‘Street Galleries the first gallery lever
. to encourage cell phone ‘usage while

viewing the art.

Only at “Gallery Crawl” can one be
so hip as to dig art and talk on a cell
phone at the same time.

There are more than a, dozen other
venues and spaces in the area taking
part in the crawl.

income jobs for the Kansas City Federal
Reserve, but their personalities couldn’t be
more out—of—synch. Keaton plays the role
we all know and love — she’s the frantic
housewife, buzzing around town, turning
minutely stressful moments into freak-out
sessions — but that role gets tired after a
while. V

Holmes and Latifah aren’t much calm-
er. Jackie is the ditzy, carefree type who
spends most of her time dancing around
the building with headphones glued to her
ears. She’s not exactly the brains behind the
operation, but somehow her nonchalance
helps their plans get off the ground. Last
but not least, Nina is a single mom of two,

g with an attitude that only Latifah — be-

ing that she is the Queen — could pull off.
The story begins when .Bn'dget’s hus-
band (Ted Danson) breaks the news to her,
that they are hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars in debt and that he has been ﬁred from
his current job. In order to generate income,
Keaton takes a job as a janitor at the local
Federal Reserve Bank. And as soon as she
sets her eyes on the billions of dollars be-
ing handled within the building, her thirst to
get her own hands on that money becomes

a goal she can’t get out of her mind.

Within 20 minutes of the movie, the
viewer knows that the plan is foiled and
the criminals are caught because the ﬁlm is
cut with one—minute intervals of each main
character in a police interrogation room,
telling his or her part of the tale. The plan
is Bridget’s brainchild, but it can’t succeed
without a cash cart worker (Holmes) and a
cash disposal woman (Latifah). The layout
really is bulletproof, but common weak-
nesses, namely laziness and greed, end up

‘triggering complications that drawn,-out

plans and the girls’ charm may not get them
out of. p
The plot is simple and fairly predict-

", able, but at least the suspense of their im-

pending capture is an entertaining factor.
There are comedic aspects to the ﬁlm, too:
Keaton lurking around like a criminal,

Latifah using her curvaceous frame to se- "
duce security guards and a few other bits‘

of sexual humor. The humor often deals

with sex, though it’s the kind of matronly

talk about a lack of sex that pervades chick
ﬂicks with older women in the lead roles.

As for the acting, it’s mediocre at best.

Fake handbags don’t hurt the Wallet, but cheapen product  «

Fake Bags, page 16

ey from counterfeiting goes directly to ﬁnance
human trafﬁcking, money laundering and
child labor. The money you spend on a fake
Louis Vuitton is supporting international crime.
Recently, designers and authorities have be-
gun to crack down on counterfeiters. Vendors
can no longer be seen with all of their goods
lined up- for the public to view in broad day-
light You now have to venture into basements
and dark alleys to get your fake Chanel.
f Additionally, the Bazaar article details
how counterfeiters have begun to use more
sophisticated methods, such as putting a dis-

_guise coating over the entire bag to hide the

counterfeit logos underneath to fool customs
ofﬁcers. Another method is slightly modifying

a logo and then applying for a patent on that ,

trademark When asked, ﬂre counterfeiter can
say the application is pending. The documents
are legal, and even though ﬂre application will
be rejected in a few monﬂis, the counterfeiter
can make money until then.

Purses aren’t the only items being knocked
off. While there is such a ﬁne line between
drawing inspiration from a design and real
counterfeiting, popular teen retailer Forever
21 has come under ﬁre recently for allegedly
copying pattems from both Diane Von Furst-
’enberg’s collection and Gwen Stefani’s Hara-
 Lovers line, according to news articles

by from Women’s Wear Dai1y’s website, MSN-
= BC.com_and E! online. Both designers have

ﬁled lawsuits against thestore. Their cases
seem Viable because it’s.not just the design of
the garment but the actual pattern on the fabric
that’s been copied. -
_While ﬂie proﬁts Forever 21 earns aren’t

a married couple — the idea of federal crimes
and going bankrupt only makes them smile

“and give each other hugs. Perhaps this light-

heartedness is meant to aid the comedy, but
it really comes across like they’re faking it.
y Holmes gives another performance that’s
hard to take seriously. She tries so hard to
be‘ childishly naive that it begins to feel like

you’re watching a child actor, a beginner in

the business. She balances the trio with her

A youth, but her ditzy dialogue gets old after a '
‘ while

The ﬁlm didn’t leave me disappointed,
but it certainly didn’t leave me wantin g more.
The mixture of Keaton’s frenzied character
and Holmes’ stupidity may wear you out by

the end, but at least you’ll squeeze in a few 

giggles along the way.

knock offs still aﬁect the industry. Even if you
‘don’t buy into the fact that designers are 1os—
ing money ﬁom consumers buying knockoifs,
counterfeiting greatly dilutes the brands value.

For example, I probably would not buy a
signature Louis Vuitton LV monogrammed
bag because it has been so widely counterfeit

VV1thout really examining it, it’s pretty hard to '

determine whether the bag is genuine or not
So what’s the point in paying‘ six times the
price for the real thing if everyone will think
it’s a fake anyway? ‘

Kim Jones, owner of Karma Fashion in the

_Soutlr Side Works, agrees.

“There has been a lot of talk in Women’s Wear
Daily regarding counterfeit handbags and the
impact they’ve had on the industry through
decreased sales and the way consumers View

Men's basketball -

Scarlet Knights ride upset into Pete“

-by Tony Ferraiolo
Staff Writer‘

It’s been a mystifying season thus far for
Rutgers men’s basketball. ’ 0

After dropping its ﬁrst ﬁve conference
games by double-digits, Rutgers (9-11, 1-6
Big East) fought hard and competed for 40
minutes at DePaul last Saturday, only to
blow a 15-point halftime lead and lose their
sixth straight conference game.

The loss to DePau1 marked the ﬁrst time
since the 2000-01 season that Rutgers start-
ed conference play with six straight defeats.
However, they played hard, and it might
have been a sign of progress.

Then against No. 18 Villanova on
Wednesday night, Rutgers did two things it
had previously been unable to accomplish.
The Scarlet Knights didn’t just win their ﬁrst
conference game, but for the ﬁrst time this
season the Scarlet Knights showed that they
were capable of ﬁnishing a conference game
strong, as they outscored Villanova, 40-36,
in the second half on their way to an 80-68
upset. V

It was a big victory for Rutgers, and
while head coach Fred Hill recognizes it
was just one win, he hopes the upset will
help his teaIn’s psyche _ heading into this

Saturday’s 6 p.m. matchup with Pitt at the
Petersen Events Center, where Pitt is nearly
unbeatable.

“You want to get rewarded -for the hard
work you put in, but it is justa win,” Hill
said. “But we needed a win to feel good
about everything we’ve been doing. We’ve
been making progress and getting better.”

Furthermore, the win over Villanova
marked the ﬁrst time Rutgers hasbeaten a
ranked opponent in more than two ‘years.

It was also two years ago when Pitt (16-3,
4-2 Big East) and Rutgers last squared off.
The teams didn’t meet at all last year be-
cause the Big Eastschedule didn’t require
every team to face one another.

Like the Scarlet Knights, the Panthers
also rebounded on Wednesday night, beating
St. Johns, 81-57, at Madison Square Garden
after losing at Cincinnati last Saturday.

But Pitt coach Jamie Dixon knows one
win won’t ﬁx his teanfs problems.

“We are nowhere near where we need to
be, and we know that,” Dixon said after the
St. John’s game.

It appears Sam Young is exactly where
he wants to be. 1 .'

Young continued his campaign to be the
league’s most improved player, not to men-
tion its MVP, with a 26-point effort against

women’s basketball

Pitt hopes to Pack the Pete

by Randy Lieberman
For Tbe Pitt New

After winning yet again, the No. 19-
ranked Pitt women’s basketball team will
look to make it 10 wins in a row when Pitt
hosts Louisville at 2 p.m. on Sunday.

And Pitt coach Agnus Berenato wants as
many people as possible to see it.

“When you can have several thousand
people in the Pete, it creates an electric en-
vironment. I want my players to feel that
electricity,” Berenato said. “Our sixth man
is huge.”

The Panthers (15-3, 5-0 Big East) roll
into their meeting with the Cardinals -— the
sixth armual “Pack the Petersen” event -
on a nine-game winning streak, including a
5-0 mark on the road.

The Panthers got the latest of those road
wins with a 70-64 victory over St. John’s

s

in Queens, N .Y., on Wednesday night Pitt
built a 33-21 halftime lead and opened the
second half on a 16-5 run. The Red Storm
never went away, though, and used a 9-0 run
to close the gap to 66-60 with one minute

left. But that’s as close as it got. 4-

The win was important for the Panthers,
who have struggled to beat St. John’s in re-
cent years.

“It was an awesome win,” Berenato said,
“We had gone 0-5 against them [in their last
ﬁve meetings.] We weathered the storms;
They’re a tough, physical team.”

The victory pushed Pitt’s win streak to
nine games, and that has pushed the Pan-
thers from unranked to No. 21 in the USA
Today poll and to No. 19 in the Associated _
Press poll. - 2

The rankings and the win streak might

seem distracting, but Berenato wants to keep

Terrelle Pryor, the nation’s top football recruit, says Pitt is still not in the running to

Open Mike

Offseasonmoves keep Pitt

football fans fromjboreclom

by Mike Gladysz
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

 

Something is missing, isn’t it? Don’t
you feel almost empty inside?

Well, I know I do. And even though
we’re in the heart of basketball season,
Pitt’s ﬁrst football game is just around the
corner.

Well, 217 days around the comer. Nev-
ertheless, a lot has happened since the
Panthers’ dismantling of West Virginia
almost two months ago, and it’s never too
soon to start talking about what’s to come.
So here we go.

First of all, the Pitt coaching staff has
had some pretty signiﬁcant changes. Wide
receivers coach Aubrey Hill, secondary
coach Chris Ball and defensive coordina-
tor Paul Rhoads all left for other schools,
and offensive line coach Paul Dunn was
ﬁred. I

Graduate assistant Jeff Haﬂey replaced
Ball, while Dunn’s spot was just recently
given to New York Jets assistant Tony
Wise, a long—time friend and colleague of
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt.

Wise looks to be a pretty good hire.

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

This is the seventh time he and Wannstedt
have been on the same staff, so naturally
he’s familiar with his system. Not only
that, but Wise has coaching experience
at the NFL and collegiate levels, and he
knows what it takes to get the job done.
Replacing Rhoads is the next big job for
Wannstedt. Although Rhoads was, a good
coach, nothing has led me to believe "he’s
irreplaceable. Sure, he devised a masterful
plan to contain West Virginia’s dynamite
spread offense, but fans tend to forget that

the Pitt defense did allow Navy, Virginia .
and South Florida each to score 44 points

or more.

Now‘ let’s get to the good stuff: recruit-
ing.

Pitt has a talented and long list of com-
mits, many of which could make an imme-

diate impact in the fall. Signing day is on .

Feb. 6, but still, the Panthers have a pretty
good idea of who will and who won’t be
in a Pitt jersey come September.

There’s good news and bad news, so
let’s start with the good.

Jonathan Baldwin, the No. l—ranked
tight end in this year’s class, could be a
game—changer right from the start. At

The real Sam Young stoo

by J eff Greer
Aadzatant Sparta E9itor

 

Now that was the Sam Young to whom
we’ve grown accustomed. The nimble
forward ignited a surging Pitt offense and
sparked an 81-57 victory in the Panthers
home away from home, Madison Square
Garden, on Wednesday. '

Wednesday’s win was a big one — Pitt
needed another road win in the Big East.
There are nine games away from the Pe-
tersen Events Center this season, and none
of them will be easy. Securing a second road
win will help Pitt push into double digits in
conference wins.

With nine games at home, it seems logi-
cal to project seven to nine conference wins.
That ,makes road games very important
— more important than you’d think. The
NCAA Selection Committee weighs road
wins heavily.

Pitt has another great chance for a win.

on Saturday, when lowly Rutgers strolls into
town for a league matchup at the Pete. But

up on the road at St. J ohn’sM

before you start licking your chops and plan-
ning your post-game party, look at the scores
from Wednesday’s scoreboard. Did you ﬁnd
it yet?

Rutgers 80, Villanova 68.

That’s not to say Rutgers will beat Pitt —-T “-
that will be very difﬁcult for a young team
like Rutgers in this hostile environment -
but it doesn’t look likeit will be too easy.

Then again, it’s the Big East: Anything
can happen.

Letjs ﬁeld those questions.

Q: Do you think the lack of depth is ﬁ-
nally catching up to the Panthers? Brad Wa-
namaker has been practically nonexistent,
and Cassin Diggs and Gary McGhee are ei-
ther hurt (Diggs) or ineﬂective (McGhee) as“?
well. Can the team survive with mainly six
players rotating until Levance Fields comes
back? — Zack in South Oakland ’

A: I wouldn’t_ go that far. The Panthers
did, after all, just beat then—No. 5 George-
town last week. Pitt also pounded St. John’s
on Wednesday.

We haven’t seen depth really emerge as

NHL All-Star game needs
reality check andchanges

by Nick LaMantia
Staﬂ Writer

 

“Knock, knock.”

“Who’s there?”

“The NHLA1l—Star game.”

“Who cares?”

That’s right. Why should any fan care
about this year’s NHL ,All-Star game, le
alone any in the past decade? ‘

T'hey’re horrible to watch. The good

players don’t care. The NHL has a serious-

formatting issue and should probably seek
serious help when scheduling the events of
the weekend.

That’s right avid fans. The league has
done something right and brought back the
weekend format for the game. But that’s_ just
one checkmark on the list of improvements
the NHL needs to make to return the All-
Star Game’s popularity.

Step One: Weekend game. Check.

Step Two: Take the games out of bad hock-
ey markets. Uncheck. .

I know that these areas have teams, but, seri-
ously, there is nothing better than stepping

Last year’s All-Star Game? Held in Dal-
las. This is Texas we’re talking about. If they
want an All-Star game, let them have base-
ball’s or that of some other warm, boring
sport. Cricket anyone?

This year’s?iAt1anta. Hockey has failed
once in the Peach State, so why give it a sec-
ond chance, let alone an All-Star Game?

Next year? Montreal. Now this is a city

weren’t their 100th anniversary. They’d
probably hold it in Nashville or, even worse,
Phoenix. Speaking of Phoenix, there are dis-
cussions that they will hold the 2011 game
— no comment.
Solution: Have the ‘Winter Classic” be
an All-Star Game. _
Step Three: Make the game count for
something. Uncheck.

Pitt football?   Bowl game?

6—foot§6, 220 pounds, the kid has great
size and is fast enough to play wide re~
ceiver. With Baldwin, Oderick Turner,
T.J. Porter and a healthy Derek Kinder,
Pitt could have one of the more dangerous
receiving corps in the Big East.

With graduation cutting down the depth
at offensiveline, Lucas Nix, a 6—foot—6,
305-pound lineman from Jefferson Hills
provides help. Nix has the ability to play
either defensive or offensive line but is
probably going to start on the offensive
side of the ball, where he’d be more valu-
able.

The Panthers also landed defensive
prospect Shayne Hale, a versatile guy who
is motivated to play linebacker but has the
size and strength to play defensive end if
need be. '

Running backs Cameron Saddler and
Chris Burns, along with defensive back
Jarred Holley could also end up being
very recognizable names once the season
starts. '

Now for the bad news.

First, Aubrey Hill’s departure may have
led to the ’de—commitment of Altoona star
A.J. Alexander, who is one of the fastest
kids in the state. Tough loss, but it hap-

pens.

And as much as it might hurt, Pitt fans
need to come to the realization that Ter-
relle Pryor will not be in a Pitt jersey next
year. The star quarterback from Jeannette
High School recently created a buzz when
he showed up at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter to_ watch the Pitt men’s basketball team
play Georgetown but said afterward that
he had crossed Pitt off his list and was just
there to support his old AAU tearmnate,
DeJuan Blair.

But luckily for Pitt fans, Pryor likely
won’t be heading to West Virginia after
the departure of head coach Rich Rodri-
guez, so the Panthers won’t have to worry
about stopping him unless they somehow
meet in a bowl game. .

Did I say bowl game? Wow, I actually’
. did.

Although Pitt won’t be running through
defenses with Pryor next year, the retum-
ing talent and the young prospects could
catapult Pitt into its ﬁrst bowl appearance
since 2004. But there are still questions to
be answered. ‘

The quarterback situation may get a
little messy. Greg Cross is a junior college

transfer that could come in and run the op-

Step Four: Choose all-stars 

Nick, page 30

ﬁeld advantage to the team whose league
had won the game. _

SteppFour: Put the best players in the

game in the game. Uncheck.
The East boasts a _roster that includes Tim
Thomas, Tomas Kaberle and Marc Savard.
Come on. If those guys are stars, why don’t
we bring Uwe Krupp, Tom Chorske and
Craig Billington out of retirement to play in
the game? These guys suck.

I know Thomas has put up good numbers
this season, but what about Martin Gerber,
the guy in Ottawa? He" has won 21 games,
posted a .916 save percentage and his goals-
against average is 2.61. These numbers are
betterthan all three of the East’s goalies.
Enough said. ‘

As for Kaberle — one word: ridiculous.
This guy would get beat on a one-on-one
in ﬂoor hockey. I guess the Capitals’ Mike
Green and the Canadiens’ Mark Streit are
just too young. And for the Bruins’ Savard?
This is getting worse. The guy was chosen
ahead of Evgeni Malkin, who is now in the
game since Sidney Crosby ’s injury will keep
him out of it. Ifyou’re going to take Savard,
why not go with Danny Briere, last year’s
All—Star Game MVP? He has nine more
goals than Savard on nine fewer shots.

The West’s lineup, on the other hand, is
quite formidable, aside from one guy that

they have in the paint. That guy, Chris Os— ,

good, probably should retire soon, before
his knees snap into millions of pieces.

Ken Holland should probably realize that
having two goalies and a top defensemen

whose ages add up to 122 —— soon to be 123 .
when Dominik Hasek turns 42 on Tuesday 

— isn’t going to fare well for his team down
the stretch.

But who am I to judge the top team in
the league? The point I’m trying to make is:
Put someone younger and more exciting in
the game instead of Osgood. J.S. Giguere,

anyone? .

Step Five: Revert back to the form of
having last year’s Stanley Cup winner play
against a team of All Stars from around the
league. This is not only exciting, but you
could use this as a marketing ploy.

All joking aside, the NHL needs to make
some changes, or this game is going to fall
even deeper into the canyon known as,
“Who really watches Versus anyway?”
Step Six: Get a new network contract.

So when Jan. 27 comes knocking on your
imaginary cable—guide door, will you watch?
I know I won’t.

VVill Blair’s foul trouble eventually costthe-Panthers?

Jeff, page 29

a problem. I think the biggest problems will
come when foul trouble rears its ugly head,
but Deluan Blair, the only player who has the
potential to foul out every game regardless of
depth, has been good avoiding fouls.

But back to your original point, it’s true
that Wanamaker has had trouble in his min-
utes.

He apparently can’t shoot yet, and his
ball handling and passing leave plenty of
reason to wony for Pitt coach Jamie Dixon.
Yet that’s missing the point of his role on the
2007-08 Panthers. _

Wanamaker will have to be a star or a key
player in the future, but this year, he spells
Ronald Ramon, Keith Benjamin and Gilbert
Brown. He basically tries to hold down the
fort until the starters come back.

Diggs is out indeﬁnitely, and Dixon has
said recently that the 6—foot-10 center might
need surgery. He didn’t appear to be comfort-
able before Dixon said that, and Diggs has
been battling injuries since he arrived here.

McGhee played well at South Florida,
but that was a while ago now. He basically
gobbles up B1air’s fouls and spells the big-
ger guys. No one’s asking McGhee to score
10 points off the bench, but he rebounds well
and can wear out the opponent’s big man for

a few minutes. Wanamaker can spell the starters. The Pan-
In summation, yes, Pitt can survive with thers don’t need them to score big, and Tyrell
an eight-man rotation, because McGhee and Biggs has been a great sixth man. Don’t

‘ 8 4 Petdia / Photo Edir
Tyrell Biggs, with his mid-range game, has been an invaluable sixth-man for the Panthers ‘

_ wony, Zack, Pitt will be just ﬁne for now.

Q: DeJuan’ Blair has been in foul
trouble from time to time. How much of
a problem will this be come tournament

time if he can’t stay on the court? — Mike _

in North Oakland.
A: I’m sensing a trend here. Ifhe has trou-

ble, and he’s been OK the past few games, it

will be tough for Pitt

But the league’s most valuable sixth man,
Biggs, has been a force inside. At 6—foot—8,
Biggs is a long defender with the size to bang
in the paint.

He has actually been an awkward match-

up for opponents. He is quick inside, hustling
to offensive boards and sneaking by slower
big guys. i 2

He has that elusive, high release that no
one can seem to defend. It’s a sweet stroke,
and if he’s hitting the 15-footers in the tour-
nament, it almost won’t matter-what Blair is
doing.

But still, Blair is a great emotional player,
who can spur big runs and quell opponents’
runs. He just has that magnetism, that elec-
nicity to his play. So while Biggs can ﬁll in
nicely for Blair, Blair ’s absence would hurt in

the tournament.

Pitt is 5-2
With Ramon
at the helm

Men's, page 27

St John’s. It was the eighth time this year
that Young has scored 20 or more points,
raising his scoring average to 18.6 points per
game — good for third in the Big East, only
.3 points per game behind conference leader
Luke Harangody of Notre Dame. Young av-
eraged only 7.2 points per game all of last
‘year.

Dixon attributed Young’s success against
St. John’s to Pitt’s scheme.

“We had good spacing on his drives, and
that was key,” Dixon said. “When we get
that, we have to take advantage of it. He got
within the framework of what we were try-
ing to do.”

Ronald Ramon, too, continued his steady .

play in running the Panthers offense. Ramon
scored 16 points and added ﬁve assists in
front of a hometown crowd, as Pitt improved
to 5-2,with Ramon running its offense.

If the Scarlet Knights can contain Young,
Ramon has proven to be a viable secondary
scoring option.

Ifb/oth players perform well, Rutgers will
have a hard time keeping up with the high-
scoring Panthers. 4

Rutgers is not privileged with a lot of
scoring depth, and its 63 points per game
ranks worst among al10 Big East teams. That
is to be expected when a team shoots just 39
percent from the ﬁeld, including only 30 per-
cent from behind the 3-point line. Rutgers

A did, however, improve its shooting against

Villanova, going 24 of 48 from the ﬁeld.

Its ability to knock down shots will de-
termine Rutgers’ aptitude to hang with the
more experienced Panthers.

The Scarlet Knights will look for J.R. In-
man to spark their stagnate offense. At 14.2
points per game, Inman is the team’s leading
scorer.

Inman has major offensive potential,
but sometimes he gets lost on the ﬂoor for
extended periods of time. Inman, 6-foot-9,
must look for his shot, be aggressive and put
the ball on the ﬂoor in order for Rutgers to
have any chance against Pitt.

Although they do have decent size in
their starting ﬁve, the Scarlet Knights rely
heavily on guard play to generate offense.
Against Villanova, Rutgers only received 19
points from its frontcourt. They do, however,
have a four—star recruit in sophomore center
Hamady N ’Diaye.

N ’Diaye doesn’t feature a polished offen-
sive game, but at 6-foot—11 he does pose a le-
gitimate shot—blocking presence. N’Diaye’s
59 blocks is second in the conference to only
Connecticut’s Hasheem Thabeet.

her team from becoming complacent.

“I’ve never mentioned the winning
streak, we are taking this game by game,”
Berenato said. “It’s just about today. We are
focused on Louisville.”

The Cardinals are 0-2 on the road against
Big East opponents, losing at No. 24 Syra-
cuse, 79-56, and at No.5 Rutgers, 70-57.

But the Cardinals (12-6, 1-4) pose a
formidable threat in Angel McCoughI1y,
whose 22.8 points per game leads all Big
East scorers.

“She’s a phenomenal scorer and all
around player,” Berenato said, “She’s all
over the court.”

Last year, McCoughtry led the Cardinals
with 18 points and 15 rebounds in a 72-59
victory over the Panthers at Freedom Hall
in Louisville.

Shavonte Zellous scored 22 points in
that game and is second in the Big East in
scoring this year, averaging 21.4 points per
game. The Cardinals lead the all—time series,
2-0, winning two years ago in the Petersen
Events Center, 71-63.

thought she could have won.

‘‘I was surprised. I didn’t even see her,”
Hedderick said of the girl who took ﬁrst, Mor-
gan State’s Tanisha Kendrick. “She just came
up from behind me at the end and passed
me.”

With this rapid development, Hedderick,
a former walk—on out of Fort Lebouf High
School in Erie, could be positioning herself
for even greater heights.

“By the time she’s a senior,” Pitt track
coach Alonzo Webb said, “I could see her
competing in the NCAA qualiﬁers.”

Hedderick, an avid beach Volleyball player
during the olfseason, lettered in volleyball,
basketball and track in high school.

She carried that athleticism to Pitt, a school
near home, near where her aunt lives and
eventually where she caught Webb’s eye.

The next stop in Hedderick’s development
will be featured next weekend when the Pan-
thers travel back to State College, Pa, for the
Penn State Indoor National Open.

Gil Brown?

Q&A, page 32

Q: Gilbert Brown has struggled to ﬁnd
his shooting touch so far this year. How
much can we expect from him as the year
goes on? Is he really getting better offen-
sively? — Another one from Mike.

A: Gilbert Brown is not starting at small
forward to score big-time points. He plays
signiﬁcant minutes because, along with
Young, he is the team’s most athletic player.
He rebounds well, scraps, hustles and uses
his size, speed and strength to play effective
defense.

Brown’s jumper will come back. He’s a
smooth shooter. He will be a tough guy to
cover in the future because he is taller than
most shooting guards, where he will prob-
ably play in the future, and he can score mul-
tiple ways.

But for right now, his athleticism helps
Pitt tremendously on the boards and on _de—
fense. That’s the role he has to ﬁll now, and
he does it well.

Q: How can I send in a question?

A: Send your hoops Q&A questions to
jag59@pitt.edu or you can snail mail them
to 434 Wilﬁarn Pitt Union, Pittsburgh, Pa.,

tion, while a healthy Bill Stull could come
in and provide the passing.

Although Pat Bostick showed strides
toward the end of his ﬁrst year, he’ll have
to play really well through the spring and
in camp if he wants to beat out Stull for the
starting spot.

The running backs again will be deep,
headlined of course by LeSean McCoy,
who at times last year looked like he was
running against middle school defenses.

The defense should be strong, too, car-
ried by linebacker Scott McKillop, who
led the nation in tackles last season.

Still, there’s a lot to happen this winter,
spring and summer.

And no one can tell exactly what the
Panthers will look like when Bowling

August 30.

But do your best to relax, and I promise
that in 217 days college football will re-
turn once again. Then we can all be happy
again  right?

Gavin works
Male, page 50

The ﬁfth—year senior is well on his way to
the NCAA championship for the third year
in a row.

At the NCAA last year, Gavin placed 2nd
to the then—No. l=Ben Askren.

Askren graduated, and Gavin has held
the prime spot. He calls the tournament the
best wrestling moment of his life.

“I’m just trying to take it one match at a
time,” Gavin said. “The obvious goal is to
win at the NCAAS.”

But Gavin won’t stop there. After gradu-~

ation he’s going to shoot for some intema—
tional medals or eventhe Olympics, getting
a coaching job along the way to pay for his
training. Gavin hails from Factoryville, a
small town in northeastern Pennsylvania. He
was recruited by Rutgers, Lehigh and Penn
State, but when he came to Pitt he just “felt
like he ﬁt in.” * 

Gavin’s family, despite living across the
state, makes it to a lot of his matches. His dad
ﬁrst got him into the sport through a ﬁiend’s
youth wrestling program when Gavin was 5
years old.

In March, this year’s NCAA champion-
ship will take place in St. Louis, just after

spring break. Gavin will be spending that

break at Pitt preparing.
