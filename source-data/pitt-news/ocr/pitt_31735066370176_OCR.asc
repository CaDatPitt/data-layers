Medical school faculty incentive payment plan under fire

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Pitt‘s newly-implemented incentive
payment plan for faculty in themedical
school has recently come under ﬁre
from faculty within the basic science
department.

“This whole business smacks of a
shell game in which the medical
students. true scholars and taxpayers
are the losers,_”_ said Dr. Robert Glew.

'a professor from the biochemistry

department of the School of Medicine.

Under the new plan, basic science
faculty engaging in a research project
will receive as supplemental income an
amount equal to 10 percent of the in-
direct costs paid for by a grant used for

Liver found

free of
AIDS virus

By ‘(Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

Test results were released which

~ show that blood from a donor ‘whose
- liver was transplanted on Sunday, Jan.

5 in Presbyterian—University Hospital
did not contain the AIDS virus. Of-
ficials from Presby were notiﬁed of
these results late Friday.

_ The tests were done in the Abbott
Laboratories in Chicago. It was here
that it was determined that the donor’s
blood sample was negative for the an-

tibodies to the HTLL—III (AIDS) virus.
These results ensure that the recipient

of the donor's liver, as well as the
others who received the donor’s
organs, have no chance of contracting
AIDS from the donated organs.

The final test given to the donor’s
blood was called a Western BLOT and
is done only in special labs, according
to Dr. Brian Broznick of Presby. “The
tests usually take up to about three
weeks to complete,” said Broznick.
“But because this was an exceptional
case we urged the Abbott Laboratory
to speed up the testing — which they
did.”

The urgency for the test results was
due to the fact that initial tests done on
the donor’s blood had come out
positive for the antibodies of the AIDS
virus. The first test was conducted in
Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis on
Saturday, Jan. 4. On the same day, a
surgical team from Methodist, Presby
and Fort Wayne, Indiana began remov-
irig the donor’s organs. His liver went
to an unidentiﬁed man in Pittsburgh’s
Presbyterian Hospital and his kidney
went to a woman in Fort Wayne, Ind.

Pat Mosler, spokeswoman for Com-
munity Hospital in Indianapolis said the
donor was a 19-year-old male who had
been kept alive by machines for several
days. The man’s' life support machines
were turned off at lO:00.a'.'m. on Jan.

specific research.

Indirect costs cover rent for
laboratory space. heat. electricity and
other essentials necessary for conduct-
ing research.

"It’s illegal to take money out of
overhead [indirect costs] and give it to
researchers,” Glew said. "They claim
that the incentive pay will be extracted
from some source other than overhead
monies. for example the profits of the
clinical practice plans. '

“The National Institutes of Health

.frown upon {double-dipping from the

grants they issue.” Glew continued.
“Pitt’s administration is giving the ap-
pearance of a laundering scheme in
which federal overhead monies enter
a pool from one direction and exit in

another in the form of incentive pay to
researchers."

The money for the incentive pay will
come from a development fund for the
medical school basic sciences, ex-
plained Jeffrey Masnick. associate ad-
ministrator and chief financial officer

at .Western Psychiatric Institute and

Clinic. at the November 15 budget
policies committee meeting.

The development fund is made up of
proﬁts and contributions from the
medical school’s clinical practice plans.

Glew said the basic science faculty
in the medical school does not need an
incentive to do research. and the extra
money should be given back to the
students in the form of grants and tui-
tion breaks. '

“The average salary for myself and
my colleagues is above 3340.000 -
were well off." said Glew. "I think
the administration really believes that
the new plan really will work as an in-
centive. Most scientists don‘t work that
way.”

"We have some responsibility to the
students and to teaching. Some of my
colleagues have told me that the new
incentive for research had dampened
their enthusiasm for teaching.“

When asked if he thought the new
plan would have any adverse effect on

education in the medical school. Dr. ‘

Thomas Detre, vice president of the
Schools of the Health Professions.
refused to comment. “Thisiis a matter
the colleagues can discuss at the senate

budget policies meetings." Detre said.
“I don't wish to hold a discussion with
them through the media."

The incentive payment plan was im-
plemented without consultation with
thefaculty of the medical school. ac-
cording to Glew-. He said the universi-

ty will benefit from the new plan by I
getting more research grants from the '0

federal government.

“The administration will prosper
while the students must pay the highest
tuition of any state-supported‘ medical
school in the nation." Glew said.

Masnick agreed that Pitt will benefit
from the new incentive plan. "The
other side is that the university is get-
ting more research grants [by providing
the faculty with an incentive]." he said.

News Analysis:

A look at apartheid: Divestment is the issue

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

The university divestment move-
ment, embodied in the campus
organization Students for a Free South
Africa and led by a few devoted in-
dividuals like Andy Arnowitz, Doug
Howell and Rashid Soundiata, has been
perhaps less visible so far this semester
than last. But that is only so because
SFSA has been busy developing a
strategy of action for the coming
weeks, including more targeted
pressure, on central figures in the
university administration and board of
trustees. More publicized action is
nevertheless in the ofﬁng, and in light
of this, it is important that the univer-
sity community, not least of all Pitt

students. have some understanding of
what apartheid in South Africa is and
means.

The government of South Africa
functions under the apartheid system,
which ensures the rule of a 4.5 million
person white I minority over South
Africa‘s 23 million blacks. Through the

complex of apartheid’s 317 laws. made

an official governing doctrine by the
the Nationalist party in 1948, blacks in
South Africa are denied citizenry in
their own country. They may not vote,
are forced to live on 13 percent of the
most arid land, and must carry a
government-issued identiﬁcation book
at all times. Since 1963, the govern-
ment has had the right to detain blacks
without charge, a law greatly expanded
in areas designated under the state of

~ emergency in effect since last July.

Every two—and-a-half minutes, a black
individual in South Africa is arrested
because his passbook is not in order or
because he is in an area without
government authorization. V

Apartheid thus enables. the South
African government to control almost
every aspect of a black individual’s life.
Blacks are forbidden to buy or sell land
in most areas, to choose where they
live and work, to move freely, and to
receive "an adequate education.

The statistics speak for themselves:
since 1960, more than 3.5 million
blacks have been forcibly, often
violently, moved to designated
“homelands” like Soweto outside of
Johannesburg; over 15,000 blacks were
arrested as political prisoners in 1985
alone. 40 percent of them between the
ages of six and 14; the infant mortali-

ty rate for blacks in South Africa is 240
per 1,000 births compared with 13 per
1,000 for whites; before reaching the
age of five, -30-50 percent of black
children die; white industrial workers
earn a median, wage of $791 per month

. compared to a monthly median wage

of about $186 for black industrial
workers.

The educational system for blacks in
South Africa illustrates how apartheid
systematically relegates blacks to a
position of inferiority. Four-ﬁfths of
the teachers in black schools have not
completed high school themselves.
products as they are of a “Bantu”
education designed by apartheid’s
founders in the 1950s. Bantu education
was formulated on the premise that
education for blacks was unnecessary

United Press International-

Khadafy threatens to kill Reagan if Libya is attacked

I A senior aide to Libyan leader
Muammar Khadafy today warned that
his country will try to assassinate Presi-
dent Reagan if the United States attacks
Libya. The unidentiﬁed ofﬁcial said
Libya still expects U.S. or Israeli
retaliation for the twin terrorist attacks
at airports in Rome and Vienna last
month, in which 19 people were killed.
The Libyan ofﬁcial said Reagan has not
evened the score after accusing Libya
of complicity in the raid. Libya has
denied involvement in the airport
attacks.

Reagan this week cut commercial
ties with Libya, froze Libyan assets in
the United States and ordered the
estimated 1,500 Americans working in
Libya to leave by Feb. 1. Reagan was
pleased about Italy’s decision to cur-
tail arms sales to Libya but was irritated

at other Western allies for ignoring his ,

call for economic sanctions against the
North African nation.

Reagan told a group of interviewers
from five leading European
newspapers that he was not ‘‘totally
surprised” at the cool response from
Europe to his sanctions. Reagan said
European leaders, who have said that
sanctions do not appear to work, may
not realize that it is because they have

not been imposed in a joint effort. The
European economic community will
discuss a joint response to Reagan’s call
for an allied effort to isolate Libya at
a meeting of its foreign ministers in the
Hague, Netherlands, later this month.
Former Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said President Reagan should not
have waited I 1 days following the air-
port attacks before imposing the
economic sanctions because terrorists
may incorrectly perceive the delay as
weakness to respond to terrorism.

Libya takes credit
for airplane crash

The Kuwaiti News Agency reported
that Libyan missiles shot down a U.S.
Navy plane over the Mediterranean
Wednesday but that both nations sup-
pressed news of the incident to avoid
further confrontation. In Washington,
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Gene
Sands said, “I have nothing on it."

A spokesman for the Navy’s Sixth
Fleet said that an FA-l8 ﬁghter crashed
at sea off the coast of the French port

  

of Nice during a routine training mis-
sion on Wednesday but that “there is
no indication that it is anything other
than an accident.”

Plot uncovered
to kill W. German

.A West German report said that
Libya has ordered the assassination of
West Germany’s foreign minister. The
West German newspaper (In Bild Am
Sonntag) did not say why Foreign

Minister Hans-Dietrich Genschei’

should be the target of a Libyan plot,
but did say that the warning was passed
along by an unidentiﬁed Arab country
which said a Palestinian terrorist has
been assigned the hit job. A West Ger-
man Federal Prosecutor is quoted as
having said that Arab commandos
could be smuggled into West Germany
through East Berlin and that the
assassins may have arrived already.
The prosecutor said that-West Ger-
many’s leftist terrorist group, the Red
Army Faction, might be involved in a
plot against Genscher.

Police arrest
anti—abortionists

Pittsburgh police arrested 14 anti-
abortion protestors who tied themselves
together, sang songs and asked clients
not to enter a women’s center on Satur-
day. Police said the demonstrators,
four men and ten women, were ar-
rested at the East Allegheny Women’s

I Center after they blocked access to

elevators inside the building and re-
fused to leave when told. The I4 pro-
testors were charged with failing to
disperse, disorderly conduct, obstruct-
ing trafﬁc, criminal conspiracy and de-
ﬁant trespass.

Art or Eyesore?  

Often the distinction between what is art and

I what is an eyesore is none-too-obvious, especial-

ly to the layman. The untrained eye of the
uninitiated is likely to miss the subtleties and
intricacies that deﬁne a work of art and make
it palpable. No, the common mancannot truly
know art for he has not studied art.

For this reason, Mayor Richard Caliguiri’s
decision to call a halt to the controversy, created
over the di Suvero sculpture is a sensible one.
Deferential to the well—eonsidered opinion of the
emminently qualiﬁed experts who make up the
city Art Commission, Mayor Caliguiri an-

nounced that di Suvero’s sculpture would be I

erected at the Gateway Center as planned,
despite popular sentiment. In this, he cannot be
faulted. T .

Art, particularly modern art, is esoteric.
Therefore, it behooves us to rely heavily on the
assessment of critical experts. "Who better to
determine the merit of an artist or his work than
those» who have devoted a considerable amount
of their energies to the study of art?

Many of the world’s most reverred and
celebrated artists were unappreciated by their
contemporaries. Edgar Allen Poe comes im-
mediately to mind as one who was unable to earn
a living by his art and, as a result, died in relative
obscurity and, worse, in squalor and penury.
His disgrace was that he had failed to pass the
test of popularity.

We who lack the refined critical faculties

necessary to recognize the many elements that V

make a work of art “great” should not be so
hasty to condemn what it is that we cannot whol-
ly understand. After all, would we want to ‘be
responsible for another such tragedy as Poe’s?

Letters to the Editor

“Hazing” An Isolated Incident

This is a reply to your editorial
regarding the “hazing” incident of the
Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

First of all, I would like to thank you
for expressing your concern about our
fraternity system and the unfortunate
matter of hazing which can only.do
harm to the image of the fraternities.
However I must say that the Omega Psi
Phi incident is an isolated one, and one
should not point the finger to all of the
fraternities. I

Regarding your question about “the
actual progress that has been made in
reforming the function of fraternities
in the campus community” (from your
editorial), please allow me to clarify a
few things:

First of all, for the record, the pledge
rituals are not “commonly known as
hazing” as you said. Hazing is an ac-

 
       

ELS

J

ﬂtﬁlﬂ.

  

Advocates of both censorship and
freedom of expression seem to feel
that to pay no heed to their cause
would’ be to threaten the very fabric

. of American society. Those in
favor of the right to express one’s
opinion without restriction see cen-
sorship as a harmful infringement
on their personal lives. not to men-
tion a blatant violation of the First
Amendment. Censorship. in their
eyes. would permit further distor-
tions in an already biased media,
thus permitting gross injustices to
go unnoticed and uncorrected by
the American public.

But what those who clamor for
freedom of expression often fail to

‘ recognize is the potential damage
that the media can have on the
general , public. Sure we want

tion that causes physical or mental
harm to a pledge. The pledge rituals
themselves are a whole set of functions
designed to introduce the pledge to the
fraternity, educate him about it and
serve as a proof that he deserves to
become an equal brother among his
brothers.

Second of all, every fraternity has,
through its national headquarters, an
ofﬁcial non-hazing policy of which
every pledge is made aware of upon his
initiation. This policy prohibits any act
of physical or mental hazing, and
guarantees that sanctions will be
brought against anyone who violates it.

As such I believe it is evident that
progress has been made in this area,
and there are rules and 'policies
speciﬁcally designed to protect the
rights of the pledges. The very fact that
the Omega Psi Phi fraternity was
punished by having its chapter revoked
proves that this ofﬁcial anti-hazing
system exists and is working.

As far as your question on how many
“Jenkins and Christians” are there
now, I have to admit that if an in-
dividual pledge accepts being hazed
without reporting it, there is not much
that the IFC or the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities can do. But frankly, I per-
sonally can assure you that in the

. University of Pittsburgh, incidents of

hazing are very limited.
Finally, if one takes into considera-
tion the very limited incidents of haz-

The Devil ’s Advocate / Charles Ward
Censorship vs. Freedom Of Expression

of some form of control can lead
to the kinds of excesses that
threaten to undermine the values of
our society and that exercise a
nocuous inﬂuence over the impres-
sionable (e.g. young children).
When children come to see illicit
sex and gross violence as a part of
an accepted way of living, they are
likely to be instilled with improper
values. But, is censorship the only
solution? Is it a viable one?

The American public must con-
tinue to rely on the already im-‘
plemented use of pre-cmptive
ratings. By knowing ahead oftimc
what will be shown, one can choose
what type of program he wishes to
see. or would allow his children to I
watch. ”

Weall have a right to express
ourselves via the media. This must
never be taken away! We and our

ing, on one hand, and the numerous
community and charity projects that the
fraternities have been involved in, on
the other, I am sure that the overall pic-
ture of the Greek system will be one
that‘ deserves applause and not
criticism. But still, the Inter-Fraternity

Tired Of Thinking For Yourself

Sick of having your most cherished
notions overturned by facts‘? Hate to
admit you're capable of error? Then
I've got just the thing for you. It's
called the “conspiracy theory."

I use the definite article because I
will recommend no particular con-
spiracy theory — to the best of my
knowledge. I don't believe in any
(Note: Holding someone responsible
for something. which I have done. is
not the same thing as thinking they‘re
out to get me). Besides. there are so
many good ones. I wouldn't know
which one to endorse. But I can tell you
what they have to offer, and where to
look for one to suit your needs.

In addition to the most obvious
benefit — never again having to think
independently — a conspiracy theory

M will give you the confidence that comes

from "knowing" the truth.

You also will take comfort in know-
ing that no matter what happens. you'll
be proven right. Anything that would
seem to prove you wrong would actual-
ly be part of some "cover-up" or
“smoke screen." Moreover. you'll
never mistakenly dismiss something as
“coincidence." Everything that hap-
pens will have deep signiﬁcance which

. only an elite few. such as yourself, will

fathom.

Nor will you ever have to remember
that intelligent. rational people can
disagree with you without being evil or
brainwashed. Anyone who disagrees
with you will at least be a dupe. if not
actually one of them; if you've ever
wondered who “they" are, you'll
know that, too. And ifthings begin to
go wrong for you, you needn't blame

O

yourself— it's their fault. (They will.
of course. try to get back at you.
because you know too much. and you
must be silenced.) _

You'll “know" that "secular
humanists" are trying to take over the
public schools so they can brainwash
children with sex education and pro-
Darwin biology texts. Or perhaps that
"communists" are behind ﬂuoridated
water. Unless you're on the left -— then
you'll "know" that “right-wing power
brokers" had John F. Kennedy
assassinated (ignore the fact that
Oswald was a Marxist who once lived
in the USSR and was active in a group
called “The Fair Play for Cuba Com-
mittee" — that's just part of the
“smoke screen"!). or that the real" pur-
pose of ROTC is to help the Pentagon

"militarize higher education." And
aren't a few of us certain that the Air
Force is suppressing proofthat UFOs
are really spaceships from another
galaxy‘?

If you want to consider some other
conspiracy theories. you can go to the
magazine room at Hillman Library.
read the latest issue of American Opi-
nion and learn how leftists.like the
Rockefellers. the Trilateral Commis-
sion and the Council on Foreign Rela-
tions are behind all the world's
troubles. Or if you'd rather not read a
right-wing magazine, you can try left-
ist tabloids like the Daily World and
discover that the real villains are on the
right —— especially the Rockefellers. the
Trilateral Commission and the Coun-
cil on Foreign Relations. And ifthese

tions contain more conspiracy theories

necessarilly terrestrial) — they're sit-

scapegoats. (Since they've been known-
“scapegoating' "

to indulge in
themselves. it will serve them right.)
Ifyou need one. go for it. If not. join
those of us who. to paraphrase Robert
Heinlein. prefer the bleak uncertainty
of reason to the warm fires of dogma.

Reagan Quick To Enlist “Freedom Fighters” In Crusade  

In his book, “Political Pilgrims,"
Paul Hollander called the role of
celebrated leftists who visited Russia
and made memorable fools of
themselves. George Bernard Shaw
praised the Soviets for making. “the
world safe for honest men." Edmund
Wilson pronounced Russia “the moral
top of the world." And the Webbs.
Beattrice and Sidney, toured the Gulag
and found it “free from physical cruel-
ty.” Like too many others, they saw
the future. but not its quirks.

Now comes yet another wave of
political pilgrims, this time conser-
vatives, who find virtue approaching
sainthood in anyone willing to fight
either’ Russia or Cuba — no matter
what the reason. Beatified as “freedom
fighters,” they are compared to the
Founding Fathers even though (and
even bearing in mind war is hell) they
occasionally rape and pillage on their
way to their versions of Yorktown.

The latest freedom fighter is Jonas

rrrrrrrrrrrrr

I SPEND A WEEKEND OF FUN

 

Savimbi, the charismatic leader of
Angola's UNITA guerrilla movement.
and — ifthings work out. the recipient

-of maybe $30 million in U.S. aid.

Savimbi's main attribute is the fact that
for seven years he has been fighting
Angola's Marxist government which,
in turn, is buttressed by some 35,000
Cuban troops. In the lexicon of today's
political pilgrims, that makes him
(three—cornered hat, please) yet another
moral equivalent of our Founding
Fathers. -

It would be one thing to simply say
that we are going to play hardball with
the Cubans and hire Savimbi to harass
themiin Angola. Aside from the fact
that there is not much reasonto do so
(Angola is‘ our fourth—largest trading
partner in sub-Saharan Africa), you
could make the weak and cynical case
that any foe of the Cubans is our friend.

But the American political /right
which is to say the American political
establishment. will accept nothing less

than a sweeping and morally uplifting
anti—communist crusade. They have
given it the rubric of the Reagan Doc-
trine. and it holds,'it seems. that anyone
for any reason who fights the Soviet
Unionor its client state ought to be em-
braced as our friend. We are quickly
developing the discrimination ‘of a
nymphomaniac.

Take Savimbi. His anti-communism.
like his love for democracy, is more
imaginary than real. As an important
guerrilla leader, he spent a year in
China and returned home describing
himself as a Marxist-Leninist and his
foes as “the notorious agents of im-
perialism.” In 1970, UNITA's
magazine Kwacha-Angola, named as

' its mentors “great revolutionaries such

as Mao Tse-tung. General Giap. Ho
Chi Minh. Che Guevara and many
others.” Since then. this freedom
fighter ‘has moderated his views
somewhat, but not to the point of ac-
cepting capitalism or junking UNITA'S

classic Leninist structure — central
committee and all. r

The "ism" that probably best
motivates Savimbi is opportunism.
That explains his alliance with South
Africa. It is from South Africa that
Savimbi gets what it takes to wage his
guerrilla war and it is from Pretoria that
he takes orders. The UNITA-South
Africa relationship is so cozy that
Savimbi was the only black African
leader to attend President P.T. Botha's
inauguration. Even African leaders
who appreciate that UNITA has to take
support where it is offered were offend-
ed by that. Savimbi is a pariah in black
Africa —- the continent's No. 1 Uncle
Tom. And now the United States has
the golden opportunity to be associated
with him.

Little of that gets mentioned when‘
Savimbi's fans in Washington describe
the man. Instead he becomes a kind of '

 

 

African neo-conservative, someone
whoistarted on the left and then. hav-
ing had an epiphany while scanning the
National Review. moved right.
Suspended in his case is the conserv-
ative doctrine that Marxists are all
alike — genetically programmed to in-
stitute just one kind of government.
That, after all. is why we make war on
Nicaragua. They can't fool us. We
know which way they're going.

It boggles the mind to compare Jesse

Helms with George Bernard Shaw or I

contemporary conservatives with

radicals now dead. Nevertheless. they '

share a willingness to look reality in the
face and see fantasy. With Savimbi.
conservatives are taking a guerrilla
leader and making him into a freedom
fighter. In Africa. they know better. He
ﬁghts for Savimbi and South Africa.
Anything after that. like the Gulag
“free from physical cruelty," is in the
eye of the beholder.

By Pamela Marvich
Staff Writer

Editor 's II/ote.'771is article is one of a
series of ongoing stories exploring the
history of Pitt ’s buildings.

Through grants made possible by the
Hillman Foundation and the General
State Authority, Hillman Library offi-
cially opened its doors to the Univer-

-sity of Pittsburgh students, and

residents of the city on Jan. 6, 1968.
The facility was built as part of the
university’s new graduate school com-

, plex.

Despite various trade union strikes
within the building industry, the new
$10,300,000 structure was completed
within three years, encompassing near-

‘ly 5-and-a-half acres between the

William Pitt Union and old Forbes
Field. The new library has 21 2,500,000
book capacity and seating for 2,400
readers.

The ﬁve-story structure is con-
structed mostly of steel, limestone.
granite and glass. Its facade consists of
rows of white Indiana limestone panels
separated by ﬂoor-to-ceiling windows,
while inside, teak shelving and wall
paneling complement the white oak fur-
nishings." The lounge furniture is

upholstered in warm autumn hues,

completing the serene
atmosphere.
Pitt‘s first completely separate
library building was financed by the
Hillman Foundation, the Hillman fami-

warm.

Foundation to promote “religious,
charitable, scientiﬁc, literary or educa-
tional purposes." John Hartwell
Hillman died in 1959. and his son.
Henry, a trustee of the university,
became president of the foundation.

The grant for the library, which the
family donated to “benefit and beautify
the civic center of Oakland and the
campus," was just one of numerous
contributions, often given anonymous-
ly. to hospitals, charities and schools
within the Pittsburgh area.

The Hillmans. residents of Pitts-
burgh since the late 19th century, were
concerned with preserving Oakland’s
natural beauty, and rejected many com-
mereial offers for the land on which
Hillman library now stands.

In 1874, Pitt’s original library
received the Robert Watson collection
of books. Pitt then was called the
Western Universtiy of Pennsylvania,
and the library occupied a single room
and contained 2000 volumes. The
library was enriched in later years by
friends ofthe university. and in 1907.
heirs of Peter Alldred donated 2500
volumes. Through a family endowment
grant, the library founded the Alldred
Browsing Collection.

In 1918, after the university was
renamed the University of Pittsburgh
and moved from its Allegheny City site
(which is now Pittsburgh’s North Side)
to Oakland, the library received a gift
of I 1,000 volumes called the William
M. and Mary C. Darlington Memorial
Collection. These gifts, alongwith ex-
panding university needs, compound-
ed the space shortage, and the main
library was moved from State Hall to
the Cathedral of Learning.

Opportunities

Students to beneﬁ

College students searching for a
career in a high growth sector will
beneﬁt from a multitude of choices and
an almost wide open job market once
they graduate.

So said trend forecasters John
Naisbitt and Patricia Aburdene. author
of “Re—inventing the Corporation,”
published by Warner Books. Naisbitt
is also the author of “Megatrends."

The smartest thing students can do
to prepare themselves for a lifetime of
work is to learn how to learn. the
authors said. They believe that in the
new information society now upon us,
no single degree or skill can last a_
lifetime.

“In a world that is constantly chang-
ing, there is no one subject or set of
subjects that will serve you for the
foreseeable- future, let alone for the
rest of your life,” wrote Naisbitt and
Aburdene. “If you know how tolearn,
you can adapt and change no matter
what technological, social or economic
permutations occur.”

Transplant-

continued from page I

4. The man’s blood was tested to deter-

mine his basic blood type and also for
common viruses, but not for AIDS.

The AIDS testing was not started until

about 6:30 a.m. that day and the

removal of the donor’s organs began’
about 4:30 p.m. that same day, accor-

ding to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,

Jan. 10 issue.

This began a controversy which
gained national attention. The same
issue stated the first results from the
AIDS testing were completed at about
11:30 p.m. on Jan. 4. These results
were positive for the antibodies.
Methodist Hospital did not contact
Presby until they had min a second
AIDS test, which had also come out
positive and was completed. at about
2:00 a.m. Jan. 5.

Spokesman for Methodist Hospital
David Richards, told The Post Gazette
they did not contact Presby after the
first test results because “we knew at
that point that the liver already was in
[the patient]."

Pittsburgh’s Central Blood Bank also
ran tests on the donor’s blood which
came out positive. Broznick said by the
time the hospital was notified the
transplant was already in progress.
Even if the results from the Abbott
Laboratory had been positive, the
chance of the patient developing AIDS
would have been less than 10 percent
according to Broznick. '

The question raised: Why not screen
an organ donor’s blood earlier so that
there need be no risks? Also, if a donor
does have AIDS then the organ recip-
ient or his family can decide if they
wish to take a chance, even if it is less
than 10 percent.

, Broznick said often the question of
AIDS screening depends on where one
is. “In Pittsburgh the Central Blood
Bank will run tests as we need them,”
he said. “In some areas this isn’t possi-
ble. Sometimes if a person waits too
long it can be too late.”

“AIDS screening is important and
should be done whenever possible, but
sometimes, in those cases where a pa-
tient needing a liver or heart is within
hours of death, a risk must be taken,
and that risk is very, very slim,” said
Dr. Thomas Starzl, P_resbyterian chief
of organ transplantation.

The man in Pittsburgh and the
woman in Fort Wayne who received.
the donor’s organs were lucky. But
there are those who want to make cer-
tain that this type of incident will not
occur again. Indiana governor Robert
Orr has ordered the formation of an
organ transplant task force after the in-
cident so that it is not likely to occur

of The Pittsburgh Press.

» Broznick said Pittsburgh already has
something like a task force. “There are
about 30 or 40 of us who meet every
other month,” he said. “We try to
come up with new ways and ideas to
enhance the, standards of the organ
transplant program.”

High growth occupations. according
to Naisbitt and Aburdene. are com-
puters. health care. travel. entertain-
ment, retailing, financial services,
human resources, law and accounting.

And the job market looks good they
said. “We’re heading into an intense
labor shortage, brought about by a
‘baby bust‘ starting from the mid—60’s
coupled with an explosion of new com-
panies demanding more workers.“

The 90 million baby boomers born
between 1946 and 1964 will be mov-
ing up from entry-level positions just
as a new generation only half its size
enters the job market.

The result. according to Naisbitt and
Aburdene, will be a shift to a sellers‘
market and full employment that will
allow people to pick and choose where

they want to work.

Recent research supports this predic-
tion. Michigan State University's
survey of 700 employers projected a
one percent increase in hiring of col-
lege graduates in June l986. A survey
by the College Placement Service of
Bethlehem, Pa., estimated a two per-
cent gain. _ -

According to Naisbitt and Aburdene.
the companies that have the best chance
of attracting college graduates are those
that have “re—invented” themselves in-
to more flexible, less authoritarian
organizations. The authors define re‘-
invented companies as those where:
— personal growth is nurtured.

—— managers are coaches and teachers,
not order-givers. _
— pay and other rewards are based on

tfrom expanding job market 0  

performance. not on position on the
organization chart.

— workers cooperate with one another
instead of competing.

— new profit-making ventures within
the company are encouraged.

— quality is paramount.

—- intuition and creativity challenge the
“It's all in the numbers" business
school mentality.

— the positive and productive qualities
of small businesses are emulated.

—- location affords excellent quality of
life.

Naisbitt is chairman of The Naisbitt
Group, a trend forecasting company in
Washington, D.C. Aburdene. an
author and lecturer, was Naisbitt‘s col-
laborator on "Megatrends" and serves
on the board of The Naisbitt Group.

Pitt offers scientific research awards

By Michele Watkins
For The Pitt News

Pitt‘s chapter of Sigma Xi, the scien-
tific research honor society. will present
two new awards at Pitt‘s Honors Con-
vocation in March.

The first award will honor an outstand-
ing undergraduate student, while the sec-
ond will recognize a Pitt assistant pro-
fessor’s accomplishments. Robert Glaser,
director of Pitt’s Learning Research and
Development Center and president of

Sigma Xi, noted the important role the
awards play in providing "more celebra-
tions _of excellence and more recognition
of people who achieve honors" at the
university. ‘

The Sigma Xi board will honor one Pitt
undergraduate for outstanding‘ achieve-
ment in scientific research. The selection
will be based on departmental and in-
dividual nominations. The winner will be
presented with an awards certificate and
three years paid dues in Sigma Xi.

The Sigma Xi Scientiﬁc Research
Award will be given to an outstanding

Pitt professor. It is unique because it
speciﬁcally "contributes to the recogni-
tion of achievement by young scientists."
Glaser explained. The prize includes a
$250 credit toward books and one year
of paid dues in Sigma Xi.

Sigma Xi is a national honorary scien-

_ tific society fomied to encourage original

investigation in pure and applied science.
Interested graduate and undergraduate

. students and faculty can Contact Peter

Machamer in 1017 Cathedral of Learn-
ing for more information about the
awards and membership in the society.

RA THICK P|ZZA - $5 w/

By Douglas Bennett
For The Pitt News

With the onset of winter. various
afflictions — some life threatening —

are easily contracted and may become -

commonplace on campus. According
to the Student Health Service, frostbite,
colds and mononucleosis are the most
frequent types of illnesses suffered by
students. 0

Hypothermia, or frostbite, is the loss
of heat or theactual freezing of body

. parts from prolonged exposure to the

cold. Early symptoms include pale,
hard or numb skin. If you even suspect
frostbite, never rub the frozen area
with anything and seek warm shelter
at once. Once inside, the frozen area
should be thawed as quickly as possi-
ble with warm (not hot) water. Care
should be taken to clean and dress the
afﬂicted area with bandages. Finally,
avoid alcohol while warming up and

consult a doctor if blistering or tissue
-death results.

Of a less severe nature is the com-
mon cold. The usual symptoms are
fatigue. a sore, swollen throat. a
wheezing cough, and ear or sinus pain.

While there is no cure, rest does the
most good. Increased ﬂuid intake and
the use of cold tablets or aspirin are
also good ideas. To relieve the ir-
ritating pain of a sore throat, gargle
with a mixture of one teaspoon of salt
mixed into eight ounces of warm water
every three to four hours. Lastly,
remember that colds are not cured
overnight. Be careful not to overdo the
medicine and get a lot of rest.

The most serious ailment is
mononucleosis. Known affectionately
as “mono" or “the kissing disease,”
this viral infection can last anywhere
from two to six weeks.

Usually transmitted through the
mucus or saliva of an infected person,
symptoms include fever, a sore throat,
swollen glands and headaches. Blood
tests, however, are the only accurate
means of diagnosing mono.

Treating the symptoms with aspirin.
plenty of ﬂuids and rest is the best idea,
since there is no cure for a viral infec-
tion, except the blood’s antibodies.

In rare cases, complications do arise.
They may include nosebleeds,
headaches, abdominal pains or
hepatitis. It is of the utmost importance
to contact a physician at the first sign
of any of the side effects just after
you’ve had mono.

In all of the above cases, the best ad-
vice is prevention. During the winter
months, stay well rested, dress warm-
ly and drink a lot of ﬂuid, even if you
aren’t sick.

The Pitt News, January 13, 1986

High blood pressure:

 . . . . , . . . ,  -.  
. . . . . , .  ,, 

One out of four Americans afﬂicted

A new study by the American Heart 1

Association shows that one out of every
four Americans over six years of age
has high blood pressure, and two out
of every three over 65 years of age
have the disease.

The new standard, which lowers the
high blood pressure threshold from
160/95 to 140/90 for adults, reﬂects a
consensus among medical scientists as
to what constitutes normal blood
pressure, according to this new study.

Blood pressure measurements con-
sist of two numbers. Systolic presure.
(the ﬁrst and upper number) is the force
of blood ﬂowing through arteries at the
instant the heart beats. Diastolic
pressure (the second and bottom
number) is the pressure in the arteries
between heartbeats when the heart is
at rest.

Under the new standards. “high nor-
mal” blood pressure is deﬁned as

diastolic pressure between 85 and 89.

Diastolic pressure between 90 and 104
is considered “mild” high blood
pressure; diastolic levels of 105-1 14 are
labeled “moderate,” and readings of
I15 and above are rated “severe."

Systolic readings between 140 and
l59'are now considered as “borderline
isolated systolic,” new categories
recommended by the committee of
scientists who undertook the study.

High blood pressure occurs when the
blood cannot pass easily through nar-
rowed or blocked arteries, and the heart
must beat faster. It is called the “silent
killer” because it has no apparent
symptoms. Untreated, it can lead to
heart attacks, stroke, kidney failure or

damage to other parts of the body.

According to AHA statistics, at least
31,500 deaths were caused by this
disease in 1982. Using the new
threshold, the AHA estimates high
blood pressure affects 57.7 million
Americans, nearly‘20 million more
than had been previously estimated.

, , People particularly susceptible to

high blood pressure are those with a
family history of the disease, middle-
aged and elderly people, blacks,
women who take oral contraceptives

and individuals with diabetes mellitus,

gout or kidney disease. .

According to the AHA, people with
ratings close to the 140/90 range should
try to keep their blood pressure lower
through weight reduction, exercise, salt
restriction and other diet changes.

A th °d
continued from page I

to prepare them for the menial work

they would later receive as non-citizens

in white South Africa. Schooling is not

compulsory for blacks, though it is for
whites, and only an approximate $92

' per black student is spent each year by

the government compared to about
$650 a year per white student. In ad-
dition, the pupil-teacher ratio is 4021
for blacks -while only 19:1 for whites;
most black youths share a room with
more than three other people, inhibiting
their ablilty to learn at home. Not sur-
prisingly, black youths in South Africa
have come to the fore of the anti-
apartheid movement over the past two
years; organized school boycotts and
demonstrations have, as all other forms
of protest. met with violent repression
by the white government.

Within South Africa, the movement
to abolish. apartheid is not new, (69
demonstrators were shot down by
government police in Sharpesville 10’
years ago). but it has never before
reached such magnitude and such levels
of violence. More than 1,000 people

have died in political violence since

“September 1984, most of them black.

These figures representeonly the tip
of the iceberg of South Africa’s abhor-
rent human rights record. The media

abounds with information on the on-
going struggle to abolish apartheid, ac-
cessible to every reader. Make use of
it, for the issue of divestment will soon
be demanding more of our attention.

Syracuse
holds   off
Panthers;
r em a i n s

undefeated

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —- The Pitt Pan-
thers entered the Syracuse Carrier
Dome Saturday "night hoping to get
some strong inside play from 6-10
sophomore Charles Smith. What Pitt
got was its fourth loss of the season,
78-68, to the Orangemen, as Smith
continued to struggle. Amid double-
and triple-teaming most of the game,
Smith was to score only nine points and
three rebounds.

“Charles is struggling a little bit

g right now,” Pitt head coach Roy Chip-

man said after the game. “I think he
is a little bit tired and discouraged of-
fensively. and I think it is affecting
him."

It was the containment of Smith by
Syracuse’s Rony Seikaly, Rafael Ad-
dison, and Wendell Alexis that helped
the Orangemen buildan unsurmount-
able 17-point lead late in the first half.
Smith did not connect from the ﬁeld in
the first half, and his teammates were
not doing much better, shooting only
44 percent prior to the intermission.

In the meantime. Syracuse could do
no wrong. While in the process of play-
ing perhaps their best half of basket-
ball this season, the Orangemen shot
66 percent from the field. Alexis led
the way with 14 points as Syracuse
entered the locker room with a 13-point
lead.

“.We played virtually a perfect half
of basketball in the first half,”
Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim said
after the game. “We got the shots we
wanted, and kept the ball away from

Lady swimmers remain undefeated  

By Gary Geller

Staff Writer

Before the Pitt women's swim team
competed against Penn State. Coach
David Belowich thought that the key
to victory for Pitt would be to “not rely
on any one individual but to rely on
every individual." The Lady Panthers
listened to their coach‘s advice as they
won a hard—fought victory over highly
rated Penn State. by a score of 72-68.
This battle was one of the most exciting
matches of the season as Pitt won the
meet on the last event of the afternoon.

Pitt started out slowly and had to stay
close to the Lady Nittany Lions ifthey

wanted a chance to win. In the first '

event. the 400-yard medley relay. Penn

on Saturday night.

State captured first place with the team
of Maximo. 'Leishek. Zoranski and
Witner in a time of 1:78.42. After the
first race, Pitt trailed by a score of.7-O.

The second event sparked a Pitt
comeback when they won first and
third places in the 1000-yard freestyle.
Sophomore Marian Cassidy took first
place for the Panthers with a time of
10:25.63. and Junior Chris Kaucher
won third place with" a time of
10:37.92. Coach Belowich. citing
awesome personal effort. thought
Kaucher gave a great performance. He
said, “her time was one of the fastest
times she's ever had in her life.“ The
winning stretched to two consecutive
events as Pitt took first in the 200-yard
freestyle. Penn State’s Cathy Zoranski
was the favorite going into the event.

but she could not contain Pitt freshman
Tricia Rickert, who won with a time
of 1:53.17. Belowich said Rickert
"swam a great race and was in con-
trol the whole time.“

After the first two events. Pitt trailed
by a slight margin, 14-1 1. In the fourth
event. Tracy Pfister easily won the
100-yard backstroke with a time of
1:00.95. Her firstplace finish was a

' surprise since Penn State was heavily
favored in the event.

In spite of these efforts. Pitt was
behind after five events. 26-17. Accor-
ding to Coach Belowich. "Pitt needed
momentum." So_phomore Judy
Haughton provided just what the doc-
tor ordered as she came through with
a first place finish in the 200-yard but-
terfly with a time of 2:05.89.

to overtake the Lady Nittany Lions. but
Penn State came back and broke the tie

. score with strong performances in the

200-yard breast stroke to make the
score 50-47.

Pitt finally took the lead when Tricia
Rickert, one of the fastest 500-yard
freestylers in the East. came up with
a sterling showing. She swam down
Penn State's Sue Marshall in a time of
5:04.17. for the win. The lead swayed.

Despite-

Chipman.

r e m a i n s
confident
in Smith  

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

SYRACUSE — Once upon a time.
Charles Smith was the main — ifnot

the only — thrust in the Pitt basketball V

team’s punch.

Smith was the one player Pitt head.
coach Roy Chipman could count on to
pull down the key rebound or sink the
important basket when the game was
on the line.

The 6-10 forward/center from
Bridgeport, Conn., was at times
dominating last season as a freshman.
And he did so in arguably the best con-
ference in the nation — The Big East.

This season, with Pitt’s expectations
of Smith even higher, he showed no
signs of falling into the dubious
category so many others have - the
sophomorejinx. He averaged over'2O

points and 10 rebounds as Pitt cruised .

to easy wins over smaller and weaker

schools. .~.-

However, in Smith’s past eight
games. life_in theBig East-hasn’t ex-

zactly-been a:fairyy.tale_. Smith has _

struggled despite the fact that Pitt has
won six of their last eight, losing only
on the road to St. John’s in overtime
and to Syracuse. 1
Saturday night at the Carrier Dome
in Pitt’s 78-68 loss to Syracuse, Smith
hit the low point in his brief but il-
lustrious career as he made only two
of 10 shots and scored only nine points.
Smith also had problems on the boards
as he contributed only three rebounds
— a ridiculously low amount consider-
ing Smith played 35_of the games‘ 40
minutes and he was, by four inches,
Pitt's tallest player in the game at times.
continued on page 14 ’

and Penn State grabbed the edge again
after strong swimming in the 100-yard
butterﬂy, 3-meter diving and the
200-yard individual medley. Penn State
led 68-65 going -into the final event of
the day. the 400-yard freestyle relay.

Pitt’s team of Dugan, Rickert,
Cassidy and Hickman all gave
outstanding efforts in the final, and
most important, race of the day. The
relay team secured a victory over Penn
State and in the process, captured the
fastest time in the 400-yard relay of the
season in 3:31.45. Coach Belowich
thought that Pitt overcame a tremen-
dous test and rose to the occasion to
beat a solid Penn State team: “The
team continues to show team will and
teamwork. I look forward to an
undefeated season."

Felisha Lcgette with 21 points each.
Legette was also the game‘s leading re-
bounder with 12 boards.

Legette and Long weren‘t the only
players to hurt Pitt. Guard Sue Ludwig
played a fine all-around game. scoring
12 points, collecting 10 rebounds, four

The Pitt News, January 13, 1986

As I see it

Page 13”

By Jim Brueckner

The Russians — hockey the‘ way it was meant to be

It was a night to remember. Well,
most of it was.

I had wanted to see the Russians in
person ever since the 1976 Olympics.
It fascinated me that a team could win
hockey games by scores of 17-2 and
20-0. I may be crazy, but I wish that
we could see one of those blowouts on
TV during Olympic coverage. Just
because we’re not involved is no reason
not to televise these games involving
the Russians. They are the No. 1
hockey power in the world and a joy
to watch for true hockey fans. Who
cares about the score?!

I took 10 years, but I ﬁnally fulﬁlled
that dream Saturday night. _

As I settled into my seat, the first
thing that I noticed was the difference
in the warm—ups. The Penguins, in
typical NHL fashion, were lined up at
the blue line, firing away at the goalie.

But the Russians did much more than
merely stand around taking a few shots.
They actually practiced passing. They
scattered about the ice and began fir-
ing pinpoint passes though a maze of
their teammates. This was quite a shock
for someone who’s used to the NHL
version.

What followed reminded me of last
year’s IceCapades. As if instructed by
a conductor, the entire team suddenly
broke as one and began skating at top
speed in a circle. While moving at this
breakneck speed, they began to pass
pucks_back and forth with the ease of
men standing still.

Just then, two men broke 'the circle
and raced toward the net in a mock
two—man breakaway. Two more
followed. Two more. Fans were
shocked. What is this craziness? It’s no
coincidence that the Russians are noted
for their excellence and high rate of
success when it comes to breakaways.

Near the end of thegpre—game prac-
tice, James Brown’s “Living in
America” came over the loudspeakers.
Apparently, the Civic Arena people are

‘not the least bit superstitious. When

that song was sung before a sporting
event in “Rocky IV,” which also in-
volved a US. vs. U.S.S.R. -confron-
the Americans came out on the very
short end of the stick. ’

As the two teams skated off at the
end of the practice session, I began
paging through my program. I ran
across an interesting quote from Fred
Shero: “The Soviets do more in one
pre-game practice than we do in two
weeks. Everything they do is
specifically designed to prepare for a

game situation. What do we do? Line
up at the blue line and shoot at the
goalie. There’s no situation like that in
a game. ” Fred knows his stuff. He led
the Flyers to Stanley Cup Champion-
ships in 1974 and 1975.

Before I was able to finish the pro-
gram, the teams came back out onto the
ice for the actual game.

I began to feel chills of anticipation.
I felt honored to be there. I considered
it to be a great privilege.

But suddenly, the joy was interrupted
by ugliness. There was now reason to
be embarrassed, and I was ashamed to
be an American. Unbelievably, people
had the nerve to be talking and carry-
ing on rather loudly and rather rudely
during the playing of the Russian na-
tional anthem. It’s a shame that so
many Americans have so little respect
and even less class. These kings of peo-
ple are a disgrace. I wanted to go down
and apologize for all the low—lifes.

If you don’t like reading the truth and
you feel like writing to The Pitt News
and saying that I shouldn’t be allowed

to praise the Russians and condemn a
few Americans, then be my guest. Be
sure to include your name. I want
everyone to know who’s afraid of hear-
ing the truth. I’m the writer who isn’t
afraid to call it as I see it.

Blind patriotism isn’t for me.

What I do go for is what took place
on the ice — from both teams. It was
one of the best hockey games that I
have ever seen. It was a picture of
class.

The first 30 seconds of the game
were typical of the Russians. The
Penguins won the faceoff and sent the
puck into the Russians’ end. They sent
a barrage at them for over 20 seconds.
The Penguins were playing at a furious
pace. But as soon as Vladimir Kovin
gained control of the puck, the crowd
seemed to sense danger. He sent the
puck ahead, out of the reach of Sergei
Svetlov. Nonetheless, Svetlov hustled
in, got possession of the puck, and set
up Sergeo Yashin for the game‘s first
goal, just 27 seconds into the game.

The Penguins would continue to
create golden scoring opportunities for
themselves, only to be shut down by
the superior play of Russian goalie
Vladimir Myshkin.

Many of the “knowledgeable” fans
were forced to eat a large helping of
crow. The introduction of Denis Her-
ron as the Penguins’ starting goaltender
was met with a chorus of boos. Her-
ron responded by playing the best game
that I have ever seen him play. The
score could easily have been 10-3, in-
stead of the 3-3 tie. ’

Late in the first period, Anatoli An-
tipov scored on the most incredible

-display of teamwork that I have yet

witnessed. Yuri Leonov sent a pass
around a Penguin defenseman by bank-
ing it off of the boards to Antipov, who
caught the pass in full stride without
even looking back. You know that a
pass like that could not result in
anything but a goal.

Other interesting plays were to
follow. Mike Bullard was shocked
when his stick was knocked into the net

and Myshkin made no attempt to stop
him from picking it up.

The Penguin goal that tied the game
at 3-3 was Mario Lemieux at his finest.
Tied up in front of the Russians’ net,
Lemieux sent a one-arrned picture-
perfect pass to Willy Lindstrum who
fired it home.

Many, in fact most, will say I’m
crazy, but I honestly feel that Mario
Lemieux is the finest hockey player in
the world today. If he could play on a
line with Jari Kurri, he would shatter
Gretzky’s records.

When the Russians declined to play
overtime, the fans originally booed, but
many could not resist cheering a class
act. The Russian players saluted the
fans by raising their sticks, a noble
gesture considering the ill-treatment by
the fans. But the Russians have class.

It was a great game. We should be
proud of the Penguins for their
magnanimous effort. It was night of
classic hockey.

Gymnasts dominate Temple

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnastics team
dominated the all-around Saturday to
beat Temple University, 174.65 to
170.40.

Pitt junior Alisa Spector took top all-
around honors with a score of 35.95.
Sophomore Beth Waters was close
behind with 35.85, winning two in-
dividual events in the process. Senior
Kristy Pieters was third for the Lady
Panthers.

Pitt also dominated the individual
events, claiming the top three places on
each apparatus. “Beam was our best
event,” said head coach Donna Sanft.
Waters tied with Temple freshman Kris
Hollenbock for first place. Both scored
9.15. Spector and Pitt freshman Trish
Aser were second and third, scoring
9.10 and 9.0 respectively.

Waters also won the uneven bars
with an 8.8, in spite of falling on her
dismount. Spector and Pieters tied for
second place. Pieters was the only Pitt
gymnast to complete her routine
without a fall.

“I’m not disappointed though,”
Sanft said, “The routines weren’t slop-
py. They’re close to hitting them.
[Assistant coach] Louie and I commit-
ted ourselves to not watering bars
down.”

Vault also was a clean event for Pitt.
Spector won with a 9.2 for her hand-
spring front, a’ vault consisting of a
handspring onto the horse and a for-
ward one—and-one-half somersault off.
“That was one of the best vaults I’ve
seen her do in collegiate competition, ”
Sanft said. Sanft also was pleased with
Aser’s 9.1, good for second place. The
maximum score possible on Aser‘s
vault, a handspring full twist, is 9.4.
Thus, her vault was “almost perfect,”
according to Sanft.

Pieters, recovering from ar-
throscopic knee surgery last semester,
scored a strong 9.3 to win the final
event, the floor exercise, for Pitt. Spec-
tor scored a 9.15 for second place and
Aser came in with a 9.0 for third.
“Alisa did a sky-high double back but

over-rotated and touched down one
hand.” Without that deduction, Sanft
estimated Spector’s routine to be in the
9.5 range.

Sanft was pleased with her team‘s
perfonnance. “They warmed up relax-
ed and composed and they competed
that way  At the beginning of the
season, I didn’t think we had the poten-
tial to score in the 1805 but now we
have to start thinking about it. We an-
ticipate upping the difficulty for the
next meet.”

Temple impressed Sanft too. “They
had no coach for the first two months
of the season. They have alot of
talented kids. Hollenbock was real im-
pressive.”

The Lady Panthers’ next meet is at
home, Jan. 25, against New Hamp-
shire. New Hampshire is one of the top
teams in the region. along with Penn
State, Ohio State and Pitt. “It should
be a close one,” said Sanft.

Smith slumping——

,'l,"he Pitt News.-January 13, 1986

 Syracuse-

continued from page 11

“He’s struggling a little bit right
now,” Chipman said. “Everybody‘s
putting two guys on him. I think he’s
a little disappointed offensively right
now. He had a rough game earlier in
the week against Seton Hall too, but
they had three people on him.”

Saturday, Smith was double- and
triple-teamed as Syracuse's zone
defense collapsed on him every time
Pitt looked his direction.

Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim
said he was surprised at how well his

Orangemen played defensively against

Smith.

“We were successful in keeping the
ball away from Charles Smith a little
more than I thought.“ Boeheim said.
“When they did get Smith the ball, for-
tunately he missed his shots."

. Missed shots have been the way of
life for Smith of late. In his last seven
games, Smith has averaged only 13
points and six rebounds — far below
both his and Chipman’s expectations.

“Ijust wish Smitty wouldn’t let his
shooting affect his,rebounding,” Chip-
man said. .

Smith isn’t sure why he’s struggling.
“I don't know what’s wrong. I’ve just
been missing some shots. Basketball is
a sport where there‘s a lot of ups and
downs."

The downs have exceeded the ups
recently for Smith, but Chipman still
insists Pitt will center its offensive
game plan around hint.

“We’re still going to look for

Smith," Chipman said. “Smith’s a
great player and ifl stop trying‘ to get
the ball into Smith, I would retire now.
Actually, ifl stop trying to get the ball
into him [the Pitt Athletic Department]
would retire me:”

For Chipman‘s sake, Curtis Aiken
has come to Smith’s aide during the lat-
ter’s slump.

While Smith's scoring and rebound-
ing has gone AWOL. Aiken has pick-
ed up the slack armed with a bul1‘s eye
shot that can and will destroy from 30
feet.

Playing with confidence after being
moved from point guard to shooting
guard, Aiken has shot over 65 percent
from the field the past five games while
averaging over 20 points per game.

Chipman said he was happy with
Pitt's play against Syracuse. Consider-
ing that Pitt lost by only 10 on the road
in front of 32,064 fans against the na-
tions fourth best team and that his star
played poorly, Chipman should be
smiling.

“I thought we played well,” Chip-
man said. “They're the best team we
have played this year.”

Chipman realizes that a player of
Smith’s caliber won’t stay down long.
When he does come out of his slump
it could result in long nights for many
an opponent with Aiken shooting so
superbly.

“Smith will bounce back,“ Chipman
said. “We have to continue to go to
Smith because he’s such a great

player.”

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News
Pitt center Charles Smith faced double- and triple-
teaming against Syracuse. The strategy worked, as
Smith was held to nine points and three rebounds.

Smith a little more than I thought we
could."

Things went downhill for the
Orangemen very fast in the early stages
of the second half, however. Pitt
switched to a man-to—man defense in-
stead of the 1-3-1 it used in the first
half. and junior guard Curtis Aiken
took over —— Aiken from 22-feet, Aiken
with a left-handed layup. Aiken with
a dunk. Aiken from 20—feet.

The upstate New York native reeled
off eight straight points in a stretch that
saw Pitt outscore Syracuse 20-11.

The Panthers trailed by four, 54-50,
and were looking to cut the lead to two
when senior Darryl Shepherd was
called for traveling. Syracuse respond-
ed by scoring 11 unanswered points.
and the Panthers were in the hole again,
this time trailing 65-50 with just over
six minutes remaining. The closest the
Panthers would get after that was seven
points (69-62) at the 3:02 mark, but
Syracuse’s power game took over.
Seikaly and Addison put the nails in the
Panther cofﬁn, and guard Michael
Brown nailed it shut with an alley—oop
slam dunk off a pass from Dwayne
Washington.

Syracuse, now 13-0, shot 56 percent
from the field for the game. The
Orangemen were paced by Alexis, who
scored 21 points and was named game
MVP. Addison added 15, while Seika-
ly chipped in with 14. Pitt was paced
by sophomore Demetreus Gore, who,
along with Aiken, was one of the
brighter spots in the Pitt lineup. Gore
tossed in 21 points and grabbed six re-
bounds, and Aiken added 16, but no
other Panther finished with double
ﬁgures. Pitt’s overall record dropped

to 10-4.
Pitt and Chipman must now concen-

trate on two things; getting Smith back
on track, and playing Providence this
Tuesday night, at the field house. Chip-
man revealed that he intends to still go
to Smith a great deal.

“We are going to look to Smith,”
Chipman said. “You can’t beat real
good teams by constantly shooting the
ball from the outside. You can’t win
on the perimeter, you have to get the
ball down inside. The kid is a preseason
All-America. Just because he has a bad
game, you can’t tell him that you aren't
going to him anymore. When you play
the top teams in the conference, you
have to go to him.” -
