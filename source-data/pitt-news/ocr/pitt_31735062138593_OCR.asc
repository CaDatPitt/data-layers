 “startling” new method of language instruction is soon to be
~5ff§ii°ght to civilian students at the University, announces Dr. Whitford
helton, head of modern languages. Pitt will be one of the ﬁrst
rican colleges to make this new method of language instruction
h was developed through use of military personnel under the Army
"alized Training Program in colleges throughout the country, avail-

C

   

    

  

‘to civilians. A
“Students speak the languages ﬂuently and correctly after a few
's,’.’ says Dr. Shelton. ‘This intensive method was ﬁrst developed by

  
 
 
    
 

’ i n’Spanish, to be_ offered with the opening of the spring semester,
V f,  February 8. Professor M. A. De-
Vitis, author of, Spanish texts and
authority on Spanish American life,
will prepare a text and'teach the

_ course.

“Of primary importance in get-
ting students to use languages cor-
rectly and effectively is the native
speaker,” comments Dr. Shelton.
“He is the pattern for every detail
of speech, pronunciation, _ accent,
gestures, even facial expression. He
is the most distinctive feature of
the new m thod,” he concluded.
Therefore, the class will be divided
i_I§.to drillsections with native ‘speak-
ers as patterns for the practice
‘through which students acquire ﬂu-
ency and accuracy of diction.

In this new method, the student’
does not memorize a book or rules
but merely learns grammar as
he needs it.’ This is called “func-
tional grammar.” It makesno dif-
ference vwhether the student .
knows whether the word is a
transitive verb or not, as long a
he can speak’ that verb. ' ~ ’
_‘In the latter part of the course,

the worst ones, but uh uh . . . I got
caught _with my column down once
before. . . . ‘
Mr. Dodsworth . . . debonair

cupboard, and what did he see?
. . . a big fat rat . . . with never a
qualm he picked up a board and
powl’. . . the rat was no more . . .’
stealthily seizing a pair of cruci-A
ble tongs he grasped the hapless
creatiire by the tail and toasted
him over a muffle furnace’. . .

‘back when a bunch of ,guys couldn’t
imagine why a manometer on the .

heat “exchanger wouldn’t work . . ’.
after ripping? it apart, they discov-
ered that some genius had threaded
and installeda piece of solid, brass

’ 

rod to the manometer . . . But it all
came to a head the other day . . .
Naturally it happened to Nick Mel-
ucci and Dave Bernstein . . . Nick
was starting an experiment on the
ﬁlter press . . . but the damn pump
wouldn’t work . . . so he thought . . .
Natcherlyl the instructors offered
many enlightening bits of advice
. . . which didn’t work . . . natcherly
.1’. . They tried priming the pump
. . . tightening the belt . . . repack-
ing the bearings . . . so they ﬁnally
took the ﬁlter press apart . . . Now
it seems that Mr. Heiss installed
the press . . . he made a beautiful
gasket to put between the pump
and the press . . . but he didn’t cut
a hole in the gasket . . .«he is now a

 Applied ‘ Social Sciences
Offer Special Programs

Some new programs of training’ for community services are now
being offered by the School of Business Administration and the College
peration with the School of Applied ‘Social Sciences. A _

These programs recognize that an increasing number of uni-

'7 varsity students desire a bakground for participation in various com-

} pmunity services, which now are continually expanding their activi-

' ‘ties. These students are eager for improved pre-professional and

 “professional training and immediate employment in junior profes-_ _

' ' sional positions not requiring graduate professional education. ‘

. _ The three cooperating schools have outlined four-year combination
_ programs to meet these needs. The College has established a pre-social

’ work major for those wishing to qualify as social work aides. The School

7t'ablished an employment service
‘and social insurance specialization

cf .:,for:those wishing to prepare simul-

‘taneously for a career in Business

3 lﬁpdministration and appointment in
 governmental insurance and em-

"."l],>l.oyment agencies.
;'.:Students interested in these spe-
cializations must complete the gen-

 eral requirements of the College or
;_ School of Business Administration
and, upon meeting admission re-

quirements of the School of Applied
./§o’cial Sciences, can be admitted to
that school for specialized training
during the last semesterlof the
‘senior year. Upon completion of
this work, the student receives a
, bachelor’s degree and a certiﬁcate
lrgppropriate to his particular ma-
or. ' ‘ .
" Miss Gertrude Wilson, pro-

’f_of Business Administration has es-<>

pointed adviser to pre-profes-'
sional ‘students. She is available
for counseling with students at

all times, and especially during
registration. S t u d e n t is may
make appointments with her

through the office of the School
on the twenty.9econd ﬂoor of
the Cathedral. , '

Those deciding upon one of these
combination courses in their fresh-
man year will be able to major in

any of the social scientfes-and to
secure the pre-social work certiﬁ-
cate. Advanced students may ﬁnd-
their choices more limited, but care-
ful planning of electives makes it
possible for juniors and seniors to
take advantage of these programs.

Former Pitt students have re-
membered their Alma Mater during
the Christmas season. by a host of
cheerful letters and card-s. An enor-
mous number have come to Dean of
Men Theodore Biddle from all parts
of the globe.

From Persia came a card from
Lt. Ed Sable; Pvt. Howard York;
sent one from -Alaska, where he
is working in the Battalion’s Per-
sonnel section; .Capt. Harry Ra-g
din’s card was written “from the

 paradise of the Paciﬁc.” Capt. Ra-

idin says, “Have been there for two
years now, and like it as much as
ever. However, I would like to see
the Smoky City for at least a cou-
ple of days.”
Cpl. Bill ,McElwain ‘sends greet-

ings from Italy, where he is now

about ﬁfty miles from the front
lines, serving as a clerk. He says
things could. be worse, and that he'd
rather be a clerk in Italy right now

States. ’
“Mele Kalimaka from Hawaii,”

- writes Ca'pt.'Dave Buente, which

means something close to ‘.‘Merry
Christmas.” A card cam.e from
Pfc. Oscar Sheﬂer, who is inthe
AST, ‘studying an Oriental lan-
guage at Ann Arbor, Michigan;

than any number of things in the -

‘ tumwa,.Iowa, to see his ﬁancee,

“Love is da’ nuts,” Pfc. Craig
Lawson exclaimed last week as he
blushingly admitted to his room-
matcsvhe was engaged to a bean-
tiful Pittsburgh girl.

Lawson conceded that he owes
all his happiness to Sgt. “Sewin’
Sam” Hacker, house-mother, as-
sistant chaplain, and unoilicial ad-
visor of his barracks, who ﬁnally
consented to the engagement. .

“Da’ woild is as beautiful as a

men,,whose bed was most artistic-

ly offered to re-make it for him. He
did a beautiful" job." In fact, so
beautiful, that his bunk-mate was
awarded. three merits—-three more
than himself.

Moral: If you make your own
bed, lie about it. It’s the bunk when
you’re gigged.

The gals are back — oh happy

empty Commons Room, no more
whistling at each other (just to

ways, looks much better now that
the holidays are over.

Belated church news: The recent
furlough brought about two mar-
riages among Company F men. Con-
rad Zagovy said the vows with the
former Vea Post of Manhattan
Beach, N. Y., while Paul Worjeck
and Betty Baily of Decatur, Ill.,
tied the knot. Inspired by it all,
Bob Klein will soon be announcing
his engagement to Elaine Baker of
Urbana, Ohio. Bob is a former Ohio
State football player, by the way.

hit. The girls are appearing under.

These girls refuse outside engage-

Going along with the Russians to

Pitt’s strongest bid for a place
in the basketball ﬁrmament thus

far has been the Army dental quin-
tet playing in the Greater Pitts-
burgh Municipal basketball league.
At the beginning of the current
season a group of basketball play-
ers, who were ineligible .for inter-
collegiate competition because of
their Army status organized a‘
team and were accepted in the
league which includes the Irene
Kaufmann Settlement and Sheriff
Robert J. Corbett teams. The Pitt
boys opened their unofficial season
by taking on Doctor Carlson's Lit-
tle Toughies, the result of which
was two defeats for the Toughies.
These two victories pointed to‘ sub-
sequent success in the tough Mqpy
loop. ' 

The soldiers are ordinarily rep-
resented by five iron men, Bernie
Rock, Al Cupelli, Larry Braner,
Phil Marder‘, and Herb Konsens,

and began the season in unsensa-

tional fashion. Until last Week their‘
record showed two victories and
three defeats in a nine team cir-
cuit, \ ’- _

‘ At that "time, however, they ex-
ploded in the faces of the ’_unbeat-
en,__league leading C_or_betts. The

.Corbetts featured "such district

Sports Editor

THE SUMMING UP
Part I

One of the things we inherited along. with the  
editorship one year ago was the policy of writing only about‘
Pitt sports. This was not, as might be assumed, a policy _of?;7
long standing. It was, as the story goes, strictly the result of»
a feud between sports editor Bill McE'1wain and the Pittsburgh
Pirates, for prior to that time the News had been quite‘ free
about giving advice to the Pirates," the Steelers,'-Elymer. Layis.
den, and the State Boxing Commission. But editor" McEl_wain
bitterly resented the fact that ‘Pitt students had‘ no place':ft5
park their cars when the Pirates were playing at home. -The
City, declined to do anything about it, and the Pirates ignore
the whole thing, failing even to offer. so mucheas-a pass by way
of reparation. This so incensed “Mac? that he decreed 1 that
henceforth the Pirates would have to get along without ‘the
News- writers telling them what was wrong with them. _  .

Thus began the internal policy we have followed through-.-; _»
out ‘the past year. Originally the term “Pitt sports” meant;
wide variety of things‘—-boxing, hockey, wrestling, swirnming,
track, cross-country, tennis, and golf. But as we came to -kno’
it, “Pitt sports” was mainly a’ synonym for football,
ball, and baseball- And since these were the sports we wrote
‘sports we are paying our,fare'v_v._ells:'? to’

\.

about, these are the
now. 3  ~

because there is no competition. - 

Well up on the list ofpost, war plans should‘ egthe form
.tion of a district intercollegiate baseball league, Pitt,‘~.’Tec 
and Duquesne to ﬁghtit out for a city championship and.Pe’nn’ '

State, West Virginia, Bethany; Indiana State Teachers,‘ Cal‘-Q . ,
“ifornia State» Teachers to roundout the district league. With 
regularly- scheduled lea.gue .games' and organized playoff’ ’

college baseball could hold its own -with any sport.

Football is, of course", THE ‘college sport. And

at Pitt is‘ Clark Shaughnessy. Who we have long regard’ed:‘as’.
oneof the best things ever to happen to the University. Under.
his tutelege this --year, football came closer to the_ ideal 
a part of the student body than_‘evfe'r‘
- before: It is-hoped, ho _ ever, that football schedules in‘futur‘l”
years‘ will be planned more with an. eye-to the talent _avai_lab,le
than to ’°-the gate receipts. The. scheduling of such teams ; _ ‘
Notre Dame,.Army, and Northwestern is excusable now for.
this is war. The scores are not important and the con_tacts/.ar‘e'.'
It may be true that a‘ boy would rather play Notre Dame.tha_n;a‘.
‘lesser team. But we rather suspect -that even the pleasure-of
picking ‘yourself off the ﬂoor and’ saying, “Well, at least, .Ia’v:é
been knocked down by a champion,” must begin to pale’ after
the third or fourth time. When ateam is subjected .to cons'tan'ti
beatings throughout the season, the recent Ohio State
to be expected but can be regarded. as as

belonging to and. bein

bacles are not only
evitable. ,. —

_ One of the greatest’ disillusionments we suffered waslrin
