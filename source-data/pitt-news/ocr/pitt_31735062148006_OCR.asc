CA to Sponsor
Opening Dance
This Afternoon

Walters’ Eleven Piece
Band Plays for Annual
Hop at Hotel Schenley

Breaking into the grind of ﬁrst-
Week classes, the annual College
Association “Howdy Hop” this
afternoon will introduce freshmen
and transfer students to social life
at the University. It will be held
from 3:30 to 5:30 o’clock at the Hotel
Schenley.

“Renew old acquaintances and
make new ones at the ﬁrst social
event of the school year, the ‘Howdy
Hop’,” says J. Karl Stark, C40, presi-
dent of the group.

Ches Walters and his eleven-piece
orchestra have been signed to play
for dancing at the afternoon informal.

All University students are invited
to attend the “Howdy Hop,” and the
admission is 25 cents per person.
Stark explained that all CA dances
are inexpensive, none costing over
one dollar a couple.

Proceeds from this and other CA
dances are diverted to the loan fund
of the College Association, and the
money in the fund is loaned to needy
students at the University.

Other dances scheduled by the Col-
lege Association include the annual
“Kick-Off” Dance and the College
Association Formal. The former is an
informal evening affair held at the
Grotto, on the North Side, and pre-
cedes the ﬁrst football game of the
season. The CA formal is scheduled
for December.

Freshman Coeds
Await Lantern
Night Program

Lantern Night, which for the past
twenty years has served to introduce
freshman women to the life of the
University, will tonight for the ﬁrst
time be held on the Cathedral lawn
in front of Heinz Chapel.

Scheduled to begin at 7 o’clock this
evening, Lantern Night is the ﬁrst of
several events planned by the various
women’s organizations for the women
of the class of 1943. The traditions
committee of WSGA, under the chair-
manship or Isbel Nydes, C41, is spon-
soring the ceremony.

Members of the junior class will be
present to greet the freshman women.
Freshman women will wear the tra-
ditional white dresses; members of
the junior class will wear pastel
colors.

Although the junior class has al-
ways been considered the “sister”
class of the freshmen, this evening is
the ﬁrst time that juniors have a deﬁ-
nite part in the formal induction of
freshmen women to the University.

Faculty, parents, and friends are
invited to witness the twilight cere-
mony on Frick Acres.

F incl Arts Department Announces

ew Painting, Drawing Courses

For the ﬁrst time in the history of¢

the ﬁne arts department, courses in
_actual art work (drawing and paint-
ing) are being offered. These courses
are in line with the expanding of the
department to include the practical
arts, completely -apart from historical
connections. ‘

The new courses were instituted
to offer students in scientiﬁc or lab-
oratory work a chance to study fund-
amentals of drawings, as well as
training for cultural reasons and
personal expressions, according to
Phillip Elliot, assistant professor of
fine arts.

The two courses work together.
“Drawing and Painting” preceeds
the course, “Pictorial Organization.”

Both are studio work throughout.

The ﬁrst semester of the drawing
and painting course includes work
in charcoal from simpliﬁed solid
forms, plaster casts, plant forms, and
the human ﬁgure, with added emph-
asis on the science of perspective
and human antaomy.

The second semester will include
work in oils on canvas from still life
and models to develop a sense of
form, texture, and color.

Pictorial Organization is a study
of design, color, and the problems of
picture making generally, deals with
contemporary theories of composi-
tion, and will be carried out in paint-

Trustees Delay
Further Parley

On investigation

A meeting for further discussion of
the report of the Board of Trustees
committee investigating the Univer-
sity administration has not yet been
scheduled, according to information
from the oﬂice of John Weber, secre-
tary of the University.

The committee, composed of seven
trustees headed by A. E. Braun, presi-
dent of the Farmers Deposit National
Bank, launched its investigation at
the time of the resignation of Dr.
John B. Sutherland as head football
coach at the University.

Endorsing the University’s athletic
policy, the committee at the same
time expressed regret at the resigna-
tion of Dr. Sutherland. The report

recommended that the new athletic ‘

code be made to conform with that
of the Western Conference (Big Ten)
or a similar group.

Rapid development of the Univer-
sity both in enrollment and equip-
ment in the past 20 years were blamed
for any disturbances
arisen. The report stated: “The
strength of the University in other
respects has not developed in pace
with its growth. The result is the
University now suffers from an acute
case of ‘growing pains’.’’ ’ V

The report also suggested that a re-
arrangement of administrative func-
tions is desirable. In discussing aca-
demic freedom, the report stated that
the committee was convinced that
academic freedom was not violated at
the University.

SF A Will Broaden
Season’s Program

Of Pep Assemblies

_ The ﬁrst step toward broadening
its program of assemblies to cover
all major University sports will be
taken by the Pep Assembly Commit-
tee at the Student-Faculty Associa-
tion when it meets Friday afternoon
at 3:30 o’clock in 809 Cathedral.

Assemblies will probably be staged
on October 13 for the Duke game,
and on November 10 for the Tech
battle, according to William McEl-
wain, C41, sports editor of The News
and chairman of the committee.

A special post-season assembly
may climax the football campaign.

In order to balance the student
support given to football, the com-
mittee plans to hold pep meetings
during the hockey and basketball
season this winter. If the commit-
tee is unable to sponsor separate as-
semblies for track and baseball, a
combined assembly will be arranged
for the two spring sports.

Assisting McElwain on the Pep
Assembly committee are Rugy Aldi-
sert, C41, vice chairman; Gene Pyle,
C41; Annabelle Miller, C40; George
McLaren, E41; Herman Schmidt,
BA40; Jack Lyons, C41; Leonard
O’Connell, C42, and Gene Taano,

sistant dean of men, is faculty ad-
visor to the committee.

 

Geyer, Wolfe Write English Text
Planned for High ‘School Classes

Described as a text for students
rather thante-achers, and departing
from the usual run of English books,
“Enjoying English,” a two volume
textbook, published recently, was
written by Ellen M. Geyer, professor
of English at the University, and Don
M. Wolfe, University graduate.

Written especially for ﬁrst year
high school classes or third-year jun-
ior high school classes, Volumne I
contains detailed ‘pages dealing with
“experience” themes, and others
which will enable students to clear
away “the rubbish of common err-
ors.”

The second volume, which will be
used in second year high school
classes, discusses extensively com-
monstudent errors and contains chap-
ters on “putting errors on the run,”
“ﬁfty troublesome demons,” and
“making sentences stop and go.”

A boon to high school students
will be the many essays and stories

written by other students: to illus-
trate rules and techniques. The text
is illustrated with cartoons and draw-
ings and contains material of interest
to students of high school age.

During the summer session, Miss
Geyer conducted a unique laboratory
course in English, described as “a
workshop in English.” This course
had as its‘ main objective the analysis
of changed’ teaching methods of high
school English courses. '

Miss Geyer is a graduate of the
University of Iowa and has a bach-
elor of philosophy and master of arts
degree. She has taken graduate work
at the University of Chicago and Co-
lumbia.

Dr. Wolfe, who studied under
Miss Geyer, has a master of arts de-
gree and a doctors degree from the
University. He is now connected
with the State Department of Public
Instruction.

The Trustees Report
011 Our ‘Growing Pains’

Now that a summary of the long-awaited report from the inves-
tigating committee of the Board of Trustees has finally been made
public, we believe that most of the hue and cry about “bad condi-
tions” at the University should be expected to fade out.

The investigating committee did a great service to the University
and to the community in honestly reporting that there have been
certain features of the administration which should be modified if
Pitt is to be “as sound as it is large.” \Vith the report of the com-
mittee still under consideration by the Board of Trustees, it is inter-
esting to note some of the changes in the administrative organization
which may result from the investigation.

Recommendations by the Board ’s committee include the organi-
zation of two councils which should become important factors in de-
termining University policy. Deans of the schools would meet as an
advisory group on administrative policy, and faculty representatives
Organization of
these two groups, together with more careful attention to press rela-
tions, should go far to remove the cause of the University’s recurring
doses of “bad publicity.”

Because of the nationwide interest which has been aroused by the
University’s last flare—up, it would be wise for the Board and the
administration to make the necessary changes soon. But they should
be carefully planned if Pitt is to avoid another case of “growing
pains.”

En \VEnioE1 We Advertise

Our Advertisers

It has been the practice of The Pitt News to keep business and
advertising matter out of the editorial columns. But today we feel
justified in commenting on the fact that a Pittsburgh department
store has again found it worth while to advertise in The News.

This store has realized the value of the market which can be
reached through The News. Because it is distributed to 10,000 Uni-
versity students, faculty, and alumni, The News is read by a group
which is far above average in intelligent interest and buying power.
This market is constantly increasing in.value as students graduate,
acquire buying habits, and become established citizens of ‘Nestern
Pennsylvania. '

'We’re glad to be able to carry the message of department stores
to the University family. VVe’re also happy to print department store
advertising because it will help us to give the University a better
newspaper. I " . . y. .: . ;’

Because Pitt News advertisers help to make possible the publica-
tion of this newspaper, we are interested in having University stu-
dents take advantage of their offers. Wlhen you shop, let‘ the estab-
lishments who serve you know that you saw their advertisement in-
The News. -.It is to your advantage to do so, for you will be helping

to secure a better Pitt News for yourself.

Now that the University has of-
,ﬁcially reconvened, this is the best
time of the year to start planning for
next summer’s vacation.

I know that many will take um-
brage at this suggestion and insist
that now is the time to begin think-
ing of term papers, but such people
have and always will have—single
track minds and no matter what I
say, they will not be deterred. They
are people who are ﬁt only for
“treason, strategems and spoils” as
someone said, and there's no use
,even answering them.

Anyhow, a scientiﬁc spproach to
the how, where, why and so what
of your next vacation days is neces-
sary. After some extended research
into the Carnegie Library’s mag-
lniﬁcent ﬁle of encyclopedias, treat-
ises, and concordances, I am prepar-
el to consider myself an authority on
this matter.

The problem is: how can you come
back from your vacation in a less
«exhausted condition than you were
before you started? This is a para-
dox which has puzzled, for thousands
of years, the species of lightly fur-
bearing mammalia to which we be-
long.

For example, I had a brother who
used to go to Bar Harbor for several
weeks under a beach umbella every
summer. When he returned home
this year, he was so tired from a con-
tinuous round of night clubs, water,
and “pitching” parties, that we had
to ship him right back to Bar Har-
bor again.

He protested, of course, but the
family thought it best for him.

Psychologists and physicians have
found that rests must be taken to es-
cape from three conditions: fatigue,
restlessness, and tension. It would
help to ﬁx these conditions well in
mind.

Fatigue occurs when you use a set
of muscles up to a point when lactic
acid accumulates in the ﬁbers and
causes the latter (ﬁbers, not lactic
acid) to stiffen. Students are often
afflicted with such a strain during
exam periods. They have what we,
in the scientiﬁc idiom, call Quizz
Eye.

The best rest for these unfor-
tunates is to take up trap-shooting,
where you focus for long distance. A
friend of mine, incidentally, became
so proﬁcient in this trap—shooting
that he seldom took a raincoat along
in wet weather. Jo—Jo—-that was
‘his name—-would merely load his

away at the rain, clearing a dry cir-
cle around him as he walked.

He kept practicing and ﬁnally
landed a job with a fruit cannery.
They would have an assistant stand

cheries or peaches down at Jo—Jo,
who shot out the stones with ease.
(Buckshot, too!)

Restlessness is caused when some
muscles, full of energy, remain idle

’ too long and try to start up again.

The only thing to do is to give the

The editor wants this column to
keep its nose out of war and heavy
stuff. He wants it light and incon-

That’s exactly what Hollywood is
doing these war-bitten days. They’re
going easy on heavy ‘drama and
heavy on comedies and musicals.
Hollywood is even thinking of bring-

editor didn’t have pie-slinging and
slapstick in mind when he gave us

that’s where we balk.

To Say A

 

Editor

' wouldn’t be there.

MUCH HAS BEEN SAID, particularly in recent weeks, about
the alleged superiority of the college boys over the professional teams,
or vice versa if the speaker happened to be an advocate of the school
which claims supremacy for the paid-to-play outﬁts.

The argument is rather futile to begin with, but when it turns to
the dire possibilities of professional football passing the academic
elevens in popularity and eventually driving them out of business, it
becomes downright silly. Unless the professionals change their tac-
tics in the next few years, it is extremely doubtful whether the col-

shoved into the football background.
There are several reasons for this,
as we view it. The ﬁrst is that the

pros have a long Way-to go to capture 1

the atmosphere prevalent at a col-
lege game. It has always been our
pet belief that a good half of the peo-
ple who go to college football games
don’t know two cents worth about
what’s going on. They enjoying see-
ing the pileups and they get a thrill
from the long runs but their chief in-
terest is held by the bands and the
cheering section.
Spirit Missing

They haven’t the slighest idea what
the double wing back is and they
don’t give a hoot, but they sure eat
up those snappy band formations
and the patterns formed by the dem-
onstration block. The pros could
hire the bands and could even hire
the cheerleaders but the spirit
By this we don’t
mean to suggest that the pros lack
the “old college try.” We realize
that the players themselves are just
as enthusiastic and as willing to die
for the dear old box office as any
college team could be, but we hold
that the crowds either can’t or don’t
get so excited about the Packers and
the Bears as they do about the Fight-
ing Irish and the Trojans.

Another reason in the colleges’
favor is the value of big names,

ity, free to the pro team that gets
him, is behind the college star who
enters the pro league. It’s an ad-
vantage not likely to be overlooked
by the practical owners of the pro-
fessional teams.

Then, too, there is the question
of where the players would come
from if not from the colleges. Today,
the colleges serve the pros much as
a class AA minor league team serves
major league baseball. To build
up a system of minor league foot-
ball teams comparable to that ex-
isting in organized baseball would
be a tremendously expensive job.
Not only would it be expensive, but
it would take time, plenty of time,
time that could be better spent in
stocking up the big time pro teams
with recruits from the ranks of the
collegians.

dows that would go unwashed.

Lezouski, who shattered the pho-

ﬁcially, Al Leeson this fall, was ap-
pointed to the staff last spring and
acted as guard mentor during spring

Raskowski was edged out of a
guard position in the last game of
his sophomore year when Steve Petro
crashed the starting lineup of the

Rose Bowl game. During his junior
year, he was an alternate guard at a
time when Pitt had two teams capa-
ble of starting a game.

He was shifted to tackle in his
senior year, and started most of the

games. This fall he was one of the

Charlie Bowser, Pitt ’s football coach has refused to

University Intramural Sports Frogram
Swings Into Second Year Next Month

Intramural Sports rolls into its second year next month offering every
man in the university a crack at some sort of athletic competition. Director
Potts is quite willing to expand the leagues to enable all interested to par-

ticipate in the program.

A calendar for the whole year has been carded, the fall season offering

touch football, horseshoe pitching,¢

soccer, and tennis. Football and soc-
cer will be run off in three leagues.
Fraternity, Engineering, and Inde-
pendent. The winners of each league
will compete for the Intramural
championship.

Horseshoes and tennis will be all-
campus tournaments of doubles
teams, any two students being able
to enter as a team.

Competition will begin for all the
sports except touch football on Octo-
ber 9, touch football starting on Octo-
ber 11. Entries should be taken to
Mr. Potts as soon as possible. Offi-
cial dates for closing of entries will
be given in the next issue of The Pitt
News.

Editor of Owl Announces
Revision of Staff Setup

New Senior Executive
Board of Three Helps
Fix Yearbo-ok’s‘ Policy

Revision of staff organization for
the 1940 Owl has been announced by
Dick Weiss, C40, editor.

A newly created senior executive
board will subdivide and clearly de-
ﬁne responsibility upon all matters of
policy, theme, and publicity. In con-
stant consultation with the editor, the

board, composed of three senior asso-
ciate editors, has been announced as
follows: .

Merrill Snyder, C40, managing edi-
tor, in charge of the photographic de-
partment; Mary Letsche, C40, literary
editor, in charge of editorial work;
and Mary Mills, C40, office editor,
handling scheduling and stenographic
work.

A meeting of all people inter-
ested in editorial, stenographic,
publicity, or photographic work on
the 1940 Owl has been called for
3:30 o’clock Friday afternoon, in
the Owl office, 801 Cathedral. by
Dick Weiss, C40, editor.

In creating this senior executive
board, Weiss hopes to not only em-
phasize the senior aspect of the pub-
lication, but to justify and recognize
the work of seniors during their ﬁrst
three years at the University.

This senior executive board, Weiss
announces, will assume full control
over all work on the 1940 Owl. An
announcement of junior and sopho-
more positions on the editorial board
will follow at a later date.

Feature writing, sports, and organ-
ization reports will be supervised by
the editorial board, under the general
direction of the seniors previously an-
nounced.

Because of its nature, the theme of
the 1940 Owl will be kept in secrecy
until sometime next month, Weiss
adds.

Ancient Point

A prehistoric pond, formed by the
mingling of the waters of the Alle-
gheny, Monongahela, and Ohio riv-
ers, once covered part of what is

now the East End of Pittsburgh.

This conclusion is reached in a
“Guidebook to the Geology About
Pittsburgh” which Henry Leighton,
professor and head of the depart-
ment of geology at the University,

‘published recently.

Professor Leighton says that the
Monongahela river, in prehistoric
times, ﬂowed across Wilkinsburg and
through East Liberty. The Alle-
gheny river overﬂowed around High-
land Park and apparently mingled
with the Monongahela. Fine clay
still found in the aea indicates that
a great pond existed.

“A mile-wide, ﬂat valley extends
from the main part of Oakland past
the University of Pittsburgh to East
Liberty through Homewood, Wilkins-
burg, Edgewood, Swissvale, and up-
per Rankin,” Pofessor Leighton
writes. "

Cathedral Gets
Panther Head

Newest, yet most familiar of all
the faces appearing on the Pitt
campus this year, is the white Panth-
er head recently placed at the Bige-
low Boulevard entrance to the Uni-
versity.

This replica of the famous head
sculptured by Augustus St. Gaudens
for the Christopher Lyman Mayee
Memorial in Schenley Park has the
same scowling features as the Panth-
er heads adorning each end of the
Panther Hollow Bridge, although de-
signed by a different sculptor, Guis-
seppi Moretti.

The Panther Memorial is one of
the many dedicated to Christopher
L. Magee, banker, United States Sen-
ator, proprietor of the Pittsburgh
Times in the late ’90’s.

Carved by Joseph Gattoni, who:

has been doing the carving at the
University during the past three
years, the head and smallest bowl
are made of hard, tight grain lime-
stone which is waterproof.

The following is a description
from the Pittsburgh Times of March,
1897, giving the meaning of the
Panther scowl, “The ears of the
Panther are back and the lips drawn
in snarling viciousness showing the
fangs. They are supposed to pre-
sent the idea of panthers on the war-

l path.”

Four Students ‘Join’ Royal N arvy

To Return from European Trip

Four University students, Robert Boucek, C40, J. R. Friday, C40,
Richard Friday, C40, and George Boucek, returned September 4 from
a two and one-half month tour of Continental Europe which included
all kinds of adventures from stealing a skull in the catacombs of
Paris, to service in the Royal Navy of Britain during an Ang1o—Grer-

man war.

l.Vhen war seemed imminent, the four gave up their passage on a

liner sailing in mid—September to b

liner automatically became a part of i
His Majesty’s service, and as such, a
valuable prize for German cruisers
or U bouts. Soon after its departure
from England, the boat was painted
to camaﬂouge it from possible enemy
attack. All lights were blacked out
during the zig-zag course across the
Atlantic. .

The Friday brothers (of the Du-
quesne Beer Fridays) served beer to
the engineers. A University of Chi-
cago student who accompanied the
four on the European tour served tea,
and after a day’s service as janitors
in the crews’ quarters, Bob and
George Boucek worked in the kitch-
ens. As part of his work, Bob Bou-
cek, explained, he was required to
squeeze oranges and lemons daily
for 2,300 passengers.

He told of one incident which oc-
curred during the ﬁrst day at sea.
The crew was required to muster on

vals from then until an hour later.
When the squads were ﬁnally at their
posts the captain inspected and then
asked if there were any questions
regarding emergency duties.
Receiving no response, he turned to
Dick Friday and asked, “what do you
do?” When Friday said he didn’t
know, he was invited to the Cap-
tain’s quarters, where he was given a
list of instructions which he had to
memorize and recite to the captain,
J. P. Morgan, the ﬁnancier who was
a passenger, and other ship’s ofﬁcers.
The quintet left London two days
after Ambassador Kennedy warned
all Americans to leave England. The
tailor-made suits which Dick and J.
R. ordered were not ready. During
their stay in the British capital they
witnessed several air raid blackouts.
Each citizen has a speciﬁc duty in
one of these performances, Boucek
explained. One man with a sign
around his neck, “I have ‘a broken

leg” was required to lie‘ in a"gutt’er'

until an ambulance came to take him
to an inﬁrmary. Several ambulances
passed, but the “injured” man was
ﬁnally carried off.
