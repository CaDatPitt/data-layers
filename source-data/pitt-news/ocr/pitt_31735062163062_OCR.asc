Calendar Choice Put
To Students, Faculty

Geise States" Votinglliesults Not Binding;

Hopes to Develop System ‘Most Beneﬁcial’

The University faculty and members of student organ-
izat-ions currently active on campus have been asked to
choose one of the four trimester calendar plans proposedhby

the administration.

A. Assistant Chancellor Dr. John Geise stresses the point
that the administration is concerned with developing the

THECUNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

-type of schedule which will bee

most ‘beneﬁcial to the students
and faculty. V _
The. preferences recorded will
showdegrees of popularity and
will not be binding on the ﬁnal
decision. A
A number of students selected
at random will be asked for their
opinions on the plans, in addition
to the aforementioned groups.
The four calendar" plans were
formulated by the Office of In-
stitute Planning, Dr. Geise, and

“the Education Policies Committee. ‘

Presently the trimester provides

S for 14.4 ‘weeks of school with no

speciﬁc time‘ set aside for ﬁnals.
The first’ change proposed is to
designate a time for ﬁnals while
retaining the present 50-minute
period. -

The second plan is, a 60 minute
class hour without a ﬁnal exam

_, week. In this ‘trimester calendar
4 each period would be increased by

ten minutes. .

_ Another proposed change is to
increase the class time‘ to' 60 min-
utes along with adding a speciﬁc
time. designated for ﬁnals.

Also it was proposed to keep the‘

status quo, that is to retain- the
present 50 .minute class . period
with no special time set aside, for
ﬁnal examinations.

   

 

 Trip to Europe

Set for August,

‘Eighty-four’ members of the
.University family will board a
chartered plane bound for Europe
on August 2. i '
Included in this group are fac-
ulty members, student members of
the staff and ‘alumni, the ‘latter
with the provision that they had
taken a course at. the,University
the year preceding the trip.
. The participants will be flown
from Pittsburgh to ‘London, and
from there they will proceed on. a
tour through the Lowland coun-
tries, Germany, the Riviera, ‘Ge
neva and Paris. '

They will remain-in Paris for a -
week and then return to London.

to prepare for the trip home on
September 5. ‘ -
The tour will accommodate
18 ‘to 20 travelers and the re-‘
mainder of the group will gather
information for research work,
attend conferences, or visit rela-
ﬁves.-
- The cost is $295 round trip -and
plans" are in themaking for a sim-
ilar tour next year. Information

A new counter will be installed

of Auxiliary Enterprises. It will
operate ‘ in addition to the two
present lines. Also, approximately
$30,000 worth of new equipment

Snyder said that the new coun-

the lines during the lunch- and
dinner rushes. Though consisting
of separate units, it will (resemble
the existing counter lines and it
will be setup across from the one

These units are to be semi-port-

a partition behind the serving line,
separating it from the eating area.

According to Dr. William

‘Sit-in’ Men  

To Talk On

Atlanta University "
Youths Sponsored
By Local Groups

Two -students who have
participated in the “sit-in”

strikes in Atlanta will ‘speak 
’ tomorrowat 3 p.m. in the SU,

lounge on “The Fight for Civil
Rights in the South,’.’ _ '
Joh,n_Mack and John Carhanl:
are both registered in the School
of Social Work at Altantg -Uni-9‘

There are several organizations
which have beensupporting the
students in continuing the “sit-
in” procedures. The Central Steer-
ing Committee of ‘Atlanta Uni-~"
versity Center, of which’ both
Mack and Carhan ‘are members,_
has dealt most directly with these?
activities in Atlanta. '

They were responsible for hav- 

ing students continually sitting-in‘
lunchcounters, 'Woolworth’s- 5« 8::
l0,,and other eating places. Re-
cently arrested for trespassing,
Mack and Carh-an are now out on A
bail. ’
\ Expenses created by bails
have been covered in «many .
cases by the National Associa-"
tion for the Advancement ‘of
Colored People. NAACP- has
also for expenses for medical
treatment. ‘ ,.
. Another strong supporter of the .
“sit-in” has been the National
Student Association of Student
Governments. ‘Recently the NSA
had a national convention in.’
Washington, D.C., at which stu-
dents from all over the U.S. dis-.
cussed the “sit-in,” its usefulness»,

_and whether it should be cons

An Important’ Step ; 

V Students should give serious consideration to the four
alternate calendars proposed for the trimester by the Uni-
versity. _ u

, Although student opinion will not be binding on the
ﬁnal decision, it will be inﬂuential.

These proposals are the University’s answer to crit-
icisms of the system of ﬁnal’ exams under the present tri-
mester. Most assuredly, an alternative is needed.

_ When considering which of the new plans to favor, stu-
dents should not choose the one which. seems to be the
easiest way out, however great the temptation to do so
may be. -

What should be the‘ concern when making the decision

-is which method would present the student with enough~

class hours to thoroughly cover the course material.
Furthermore, thought should be given to the fact that
time is needed at the end of a term to integrate the various
facts and ideas covered during a course, if a student is to
proﬁt fully from it. 4 _

' Discussion of these plans should begin now, in order
that the pros and cons of all four alternatives can be heard.
Student Government should“, hold an open discussion in-
which members of the faculty and administration could pre-
sent their views. ' ,

' This is an important step ahead in the trimester pro-
gyam, and the ﬁnal decision should not be made hastily.

Hear 'Sit-in ' Speakers

The two negro students from Alabama who will be here
tomorrow to plead their "cause, deserve to be heard by all.

They will speak on an issue which has recently aroused
college students throughout the country, that of Civil Rights
in the South. «

Picketing, sit-down strikes, and other demonstrations
against segregation have become prevalent in many col-
leges, including those in the Pittsburgh area.

These two students have activelyengaged in the strug-
gle in the South, and will present a first hand report of the
situation there. ' - i

What they have to say should be a concern to all mem-
bers of the University community.

Next to C-odliness

By Jim Vaughan

Three skinny old native women, sitting onthe
ground, are working busily around a black kettle.
One of them dips her ﬁngers _into a pile of white
beans in her lap. She raises them to her lips. With
a backward jerk of the head she
ﬂips them into her mouth. She
begins chewing.

After a while she stops chew-
ing. She tilts, her head back,
opens her mouth revealing tacky
stalagtites of a chunky cream-
colored paste, drops three succu-
lent tan leaves inside, and closes"
it again. Bringing her head back
down she starts chewing again.

She raises her eyes and
glances at her two friends who
are doing thepsame thing. A slight smile “of con-
tentment crosses her face, and a dribble of the
milky liquid runs down the side of her mouth. She
catches it with the back of her hand.

Her mixture is ready now. She leans forward
over the pot. Her lips open. And with a push of
the tongue she belches the speckled cream into

/the pot. ‘

,Her mouth drained, she rocks back, ﬂips in

another handful of beans, and starts munching all’

over again. In their turn, hercompanions also
empty their mouths into the pot. '
Newer Food Services .

Now don’t let me give you any kind of im-
pression that this scene takes place in the Food
Services kitchen. It doesn't, as far as I know.

The women ‘in this scene belong to a primitive
tribe. They are making a kind of-beer which, once
fermented, makes their menfolk smack their lips
in delight. ;

On tasting this beer, I uriderstand, neither .you
nor I could ever guess how it was prepared. You

could, likewise, never imagine how the food served

us ‘at Pitt is handled by Food Services before we
come to eat of it.

Let’s take ‘a close look at Food Services through
the eyes of three kitchen employees whom we
interviewed in the Pitt News Office. , ~

According to Mr. Lantz of the Allegheny County
Sanitation Department, it is commonly understood
among persons in the food-serving business that

a food should be stored at a minimum height of ten"

or twelve inches from the ﬂoor. 'I‘he"purpose of
this practice needs no explanation. .

Food Services does not observe this under-
standing, 'it is reported, ’ ’

The result: “_The"trouble is that the stuff lays
against the ﬂoor,” says one employee, “and bugs
and everything else gets in there.” '

If this is true, Food Services should make some
changes and at least appear to‘ be concerned with
our health. . .

When a delivery of -food comes to the Student
Union, Food Services does not’ take care, say their

employees, to insure its quick storage. “According

to their own help, they often neglect to make even
reasonable efforts to keep food wholesome and
clean. - '

When frozen food is delivered, for example, it
isstacked on the ﬂoor to be put away. It some-
times-stands in the open for hours. It thaws out.
“These cases,” a Food Services employee reported,

.“just stand there and get soft. They’d be so soft

 

that you couldn’t even store it. The stuf‘f’d sag
all over the place.” _

Not until it had become quite soft, one time in
particular, he said, was a shipment of frozen food
packed in the freezer.. There, it froze for the
second time. -

When the fellow pointed this out to his boss,
the boss dismissed his words with some remark
like “that’s life.”

Food Services becomés suddenly alert and re-'

sourceful, though, when proﬁts are in the balance.

. The waitresses in the Venetian Room ran out
of rolls one day. When they informed the manager,
they were told to take the unused rolls from re-
turned plates and serve them again to other people.-

_ They -did.

Underhonded Second-Hands

The manager knew surely that these rolls he
ordered served to diners were clean. And.he must
certainly have announced that they were second-
hand, or third—hand, or how many handed they
were. ,

Food Services, I am told, are even more re-
sourceful in their salvaging operations. They're
just ‘bubbling over with competence ‘

Once, it is reported, an employee was charged
with the job of cleaning out the cooler. I-Ike en-

tered the compartment with broom and shovel in 

hand. ‘Inside, he saw a pile of cube steaks that
had been sitting there for “more than three
months.” When he started to throw them out his
bossistopped him. V
Cold Mold

“But they smell bad,” he said. “There’s mold all
over them.” - W

“This is justan anti-body,” his learned superior
‘replied, pointing nonchalantly to the greenness .

covering themeat. “Just scrape it off like that '. .~ .

them.” -

“Y’know why I did_ it,” the employee exag-
“Nobody

gerated, in anﬂeffort to prove his point.
elseid handle the stuff. Did you ever smell rotten
meat?” /
_ Food Services’ resourcefulness and economy are
surpassed only by its ingenuity. .
‘ It was reported that, even before the present
management of Food Services, a buffet-type dinner
was held where several thousand persons were

served.‘ Early in the mealsalads were served in j
bowls made of half-pineapply shells. Quite pretty,’
they "were. ‘ '

The diners ate their salads ﬁrst. "They then
proceeded to ﬁll the shells with seeds, bones, pieces
of unedible meat," and ground cigarette butts, before
the shells were removed to the kitchen.

Cool Minds Prevail‘ 7

E-'

(scrape, scrape). Go ahead, serve it. It won’t hurt "

Food Services discovered, employees state; that ,

they had been a little too economical in buying the
pineapples. They were fast running out- of their
half-shell bowls. -

_ ‘Cool, creative minds in Food Services shifted‘
into low gear and came. up with a splendid idea.

Why be wasteful? Why, sure, use the dirty bowls
over again! And that’s just what they did, two
F. S. ‘employees aﬁirm. They dumped the‘ garbage

out of the used bowls, ﬂushed them ‘out with water, *

and ﬁned them again with salads.

As far as I can see, the people who ate salads
at this meal as well as those who ate cube-steaks.
or cauliﬂower in the cafeteria, smacked their lips
in delight. ‘ '

LA School E‘fficiency
Astounds Recent ‘Grad

Editor, The Pitt News:

As I sit here, languidly pass-
ing my _summer hours, in the
shade_of my favorite peony bush,
I have come to some great reali-

zation about our great admini-‘

strators. I owe them much!

I have been agraduate of this
great university for nearly a
month. But have I been allowed
to become sluggish? No! For one
thing, my grades have not yet
arrived. This is a ‘carefully
planned act by the administra-
tion. -

This eliminates all danger of a
student becoming conceited by
his great academic achievements.
It also allows him to ﬁgure’ out,
hypothetically, his quality point
average, and (with the aid of
mathematical probability) to ﬁg-
ure out his grades. ‘

Also, by. not sending out the
grades, and by leaving thern in

the dean’s.oﬂice f we whplive at 

great distances, are given an ex-
cuse for visiting again, after so
long an absence, our beautiful
campus.

I hope that the alumni asso-
ciation realizes just what a serv-
ice has been done for them.

Perhaps a better. turn out
could be assured for Homecom-
ing each Fall, as the graduates
from the previous year, flock
back to receive their grades from
their ﬁnal trimester. O frabjous
day! What foresight!

Also, we are being given the

privilege of contemplating just.

what graduation will be like. We
are allowed to ﬁgure out, on our
own, just how many tickets and
invitations we will receive.

- We are left to devise ways of
returning our caps and gowns
after graduation. This thought
makes us snap our elbows to at-
tention, for never, since the
whole School of Liberal Arts was
to register in one small room in
one day, has the spirit of com-
petition been so_hi8h.

  

   
  

' ation. Many of us received these

cards after the date on which
they were to be returned. This
tested our ingenuity and knowl-
edge of the postal services andof
communication and allowed our
littl_e_minds to again run free in
the exciting’ process of thought.

But ‘alas, we are only graduat-
ing with a bachelor’s degree and
many are not capable of the
higher thought required for
these complex problems.

We come to the realization that
we are not as liberally educated
as those who hold their doctorate
in Education and Business Ad-
ministration. Although I am
grateful for the opportunity that
they have given me to solve
these problems, I realize with
heavy heart, that I am incap,-
able.

Thank God that they are here’

to guide us! ‘I will sleep well

Panthers have from their rainy

Since -no games were played,
Coach Bobby Lewis had a perfect
opportunity to defend his “play
for themselves” Panthers.

_Players Play for Themselves

“Many of my players have been
charged with thinking more about
their averages than the team’s

if everyone was content to have’a
.180 batting average, we would
never win a ball game. To a large

for himself. . ' ~
“If each player hiked his aver-
‘age over .300, we couldn’t help

the entire team. Each man in
baseball must want to be a good
individual performer. There is
not a man on the team that
wouldn’t pull for a boy that was
hitting over .800, if the team
was winning,” Lewis continued.
“I really can’t tell why boys
like Nick Kartsonas "and Jerry
Matulevic aren‘t hitting. Last year
both boys were .300 hitters. They
haven‘t changed their way, of hit.-

Defensively Not Stron

“Defensivelywe are_n’t as strong
as we were last year. Whether our
lack of hitting has had any effect
on ‘our performances in the ﬁeld,
I don’t know. _

“But I don't feel that our players
are thinking more about their av-
erages than they are, about the
team winning,” Lewis concluded.

$35,000 Lilly
Grant Awarded

To University,
Lilly Endowment, Incorporated,

has made a grant of $35,000 to
the University to support a study

aimed at the evaluation, strength- '

ening and broadening of the cur-
riculum of Christian education for
adults. _ "

Those responsible for adult
Christian education in every ma-
jor" Protestant denomination in
the United States will attend the
Workshop on the .Curriculum of
Christian Education for Adults to

L be held in June, 1961. Dr. Lawr-

ence C. Little, professor and di-

-rector of religious education, will

be the director of the Workshop.

Concerning the need for adult
Christian education, Dr. Little
said, ,“Adu1t religious education is
intimately related to all that takes
place in character education and
religious education, since adults
must assume leadership and give
support in every effective effort
toward educational advance.”

He pointed out that some
very. signiﬁcant new ventures in
Christian adult education are
being made and that some at-
tempt should be made to evalu-
ate the results of these creative
efforts, and to explore the pos-
sibilities of extending their
values and. of making even
greater improvement. ,

“As compared to the ‘progress

H that has been made in the devel-

opment of curricula for children

and youth,” Dr. Little concluded

“the adult curriculum has lagged
far behind.”
