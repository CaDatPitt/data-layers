Explains ‘Intelligence’ Tests
Give ‘Measuring Stick’
But Do Not Predict

 

By Charles Stratton

“The best single pre-admission fac-
tor for predicting the academic suc-
cess of incoming students is an anal-
ysis of their high school record,” Dr.
Omar C. Held, personnel assistant to
the dean of the College, declares.

Dr. Held, in commenting on the so-
called “intelligence” or psychological
tests, explains that a record of one’s
activities over a period of four years
is a better basis for prediction than
one’s score on such a psychological
test one hour in length.

However, the University adminis-
ters this examination because students
come from high schools of different
standards, an-d it is desirable to ob-
tain a common measuring stick appli-
cable to all members of the freshman
class.

Based On Percentage

A student’s score on the examina-
tion is based not on his percentage of
correct answers alone, but on the per-
centage of correct answers of the
others who took the test. One’s per-
formance on the examination, there-
fore, shows exactly how he ranked
with the others in his class.

A freshman with a score of 75,
in other words, who ranked in the
seventy-ﬁfth percentile, had a higher
percentage of correct answers than
74% of his class, while 25% did bet-
ter work than he on the examination.

The University places no limit on
the amount of information it can
gather about a student. Dr. Held lik-
ens the institution to a doctor who
must prescribe for a patient. Just as
the doctor is able to be more helpful
to a patient about whom he has a
record of past illnesses or the results

of a physical examination, so those
at the University can give the sound-
est advice to those students about
whom they have the most information.

Information Sought

Consequently, when possible, the
University endeavors to learn about
a student’s home background, his in-
terests, ambitions, needs, and general
health, in order to understand his
problems more thoroughly.

In conclusion, Dr. Held says, “When
a student really has the drive, the de-
sire to succeed, he should be able to
compensate for a poor high school
record or a low score. When a stu-
dent who has the ability is not doing
satisfactory work, we may attribute
his failure to outside work, illness,
lack of effort, or other factors.”

Gentry Orchestra
Brings “Swanee
Swing’ To Dance

 

Freshman Dance Will Have
Music Of Noted Band
As Main Attraction

 

By Jack Hoeveler

Tom Gentry and his Ambassadors,
one of the leading dance bands of
the country, have been signed to fur-
nish the swing music for the annual
Freshman Dance to be held December
4 at the main ballroom of Hotel Wil-
liam Penn. .

Tom Gentry, now playing at the
Hotel Claridge in Memphis, will bring
his “Swanee Swing” to Pittsburgh for
the traditionally popular dance of the
year.

1 Featured with his orchestra is love-
ly Patricia Norman, formerly with
Paul Pendarvis, the William Penn’s
current, and Frank Raye.

The Gentry Ambassadors have
played at the French Casino and the
Pabst Blue Ribbon Casino at the
World's Fair in Chicago, at the Black-
stone Hotel, the Brown Palace in
Denver, the Mayfair Club in Kansas
City, and the St. Paul and Lowry
Hotels in St. Paul.

An old tradition is being broken at
this dance since this is the ﬁrst time
that either the William Penn or a
big name band has been booked.

The dance is catering both to the
freshmen and the upperclassmen by
giving what will be one of the swank-
iest dances of the year. Tickets are
$2 per couple.

Parents Group
Plans Meeting
For December

Seven Speakers Scheduled
For Discussion Period

By Joseph Caplan

Realizing the need for better un-
derstanding between the mothers and
fathers of undergraduate women and
the faculty and administrative mem-
bers of the University, the Parents
Council, under the direction of Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women, is
planning its 1936-37 program.

The ﬁrst meeting of the year will
be held on Tuesday night, December
1, at 8:30 o’clock, in Room 1309,
Cathedral. The program for Council
meetings will not be chosen by an
executive committee as formerly, but
each month a rotary committee com-
posed of 10 mothers and fathers will
have complete charge.

Miss Amos, explaining the purpose
of the organization, declares, “Most
of the students live in their own
homes while attending the University.
Parents act as heads of the ‘dormi-
tories’ for their sons and daughters.
Parents want to know as much as stu-
dents concerning life within the Uni-
versity; and in turn the University
wants to know as much as possible
of the students in the ‘dormitory’.”

The Parents Council was formed in
1934, “so that parents and faculty
might get together and exchange
ideas, suggestions, and plans which
would be of help to the student.”

On the committee in charge of the
December meeting are: Dr. and Mrs.
John S. Hipple, chairman; Mr. and
Mrs. J. B. Hiles; Mr. and Mrs. W. B.
Spellmire; Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Briny;
Mrs. Alice Conn; and Mr. and Mrs.
John H. Scott.

The topic for discussion will be
“Your Daughter in the University of
Pittsburgh.” Those scheduled to speak
are: Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant dean
of the College; Dr. Auleene M. Jami-
son, director of the Student Health
Service for Women; Miss Elizabeth
Rearick, assistant professor of physi-
cal education; Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter,
assistant professor of modern lan-
guages; Dr. Florence M. Teagarden,
professor of psychology; Miss Helen
P. Rush, assistant dean of women;
an-d Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women.

The Council extends an invitation
to all mothers and fathers of under-
graduate women to attend the com-
ing meeting.

Dr. Herring To Speak
On Politics In Sweden
At Community Forum

Dr. Hubert Herring, international
authority on foreign affairs, will be
the featured speaker at the Pitts-
burgh Community Forum, Schenley
high school auditorium, tonight at
8:15 o’clock on “Sweden—School for
Democracy.”

Dr. Herring has spent the past 12
summers in Mexico as director of a
seminar in international relations. He
has traveled quite extensively in
Sweden, and is considered an expert
interpreter of the Scandinavian
scene.

More Than 200 Freshmen
Receive Plagues, Merit
Panthers Today

By Robert Adams

More than 200 freshman men
and women were recognized
this morning as being the out-
standing students in their class
as they received special honors
at ﬁnal customs assemblies.

Of the freshman women, 150
received merit panthers as the
last token that they had passed
through the introductory orientation
stage of development and are now en-
titled to participate in freshman
women’s activities.

At the same time, approximately 75
freshman men were similarly honored
at the annual Freshman Tribunal
when they were presented with
plaques bearing the seal of the Uni-
versity. Judging those to receive
plaques was made upon a basis of
scholarship, customs examinations,
recommendations, and entrance into
activities.

These assemblies are held each year
on the morning of the Chancellor's
Reception as the climax to the fresh-
man orientation program.

The following freshman men re-
ceived plaques:

Freshman
Activities
Organized

First Year Women Direct
Extra—Curricular Units,
To Elect Officers

By Goldie Katz

Unit officers will be elected next
week by the 264 freshman women
who have chosen to enter the fresh-
man activities groups. ,

Organized into nine divisions, the
activities for the ﬁrst-year women fol-
low the work of major campus or-
ganizations. Freshmen are limited to
participation in one of these groups.

By planning activities correspond-
ing to those of upperclassmen, to be
managed solely by the new students.
the Organizations Committee of
WSGA feels that each freshman
woman is being given an equal
chance to take part in college extra-
curricular life.

Acting Unit

The units are governed by the
freshmen themselves, with an upper-
class woman attending the meetings
in an advisory capacity.

Nominating committees were chosen
by lot last Friday to select candidates
for the offices of chairman, council
representative, and secretary-treas-
urer.

The chairman and council represen-
tative will automatically become mem-
bers of the Freshman Council, gov-
erning body of the freshman class.
Upperclass advisers will also attend
the council meetings, of which Mary
Jane Beachler, C38, head of the Or-
ganizations Committee, is in charge.

The activities groups and their
members are:

Dramatic Discussion Unit

Amy Alvord, Mary Andolina, Min-
nie Balter, Doris Bauer, Margaret
Brown, Jane Cleaver, Jane Coll, Ar-
ielle Conrad, Mary Jane Cox, Bar-

Scholarship
Help Given
Over 2,000

Registrar Figures Indicate
2, 378 Graduates Placed
During Last Year

 

By Irving Bennett

Over 2,000 students of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh received scholar-
ship aid last year, ﬁgures released by
the registrar’s office reveal.

In addition to those students who
received scholarships, another 3,038
paid their tuition in deferred pay-
ments.

Of the students who received schol-
arships, 134 received endowments
totalling $19,000. The remaining
scholarships were worth $303,957.
These scholarships were distributed in
the form of 585 senatorial appoint-
ments, and the rest in honor awards,
band allowances, and partial tuition
for members of the faculty and their
families.

The privilege of deferred payment
of tuition was extended to 3,038 stu-
dents the ﬁrst semester, and 3,420 the
second semester.

In the matter of placing graduates
of the University, the Registrar’s ﬁg-
ures show that 2,378 were placed dur-
ing the school year, 1934-35. Their
earnings totalled over $461,000 for
the ﬁrst year. In placing the gradu-
ates, the dean of men’s office ac-
counted for 1,981 and the women’s

Freshmen, A pprehensive, Resent

Not Being Able To Give Defense

Blame Rushing, Welcoming
Parties For Troubles;
Themes A Worry

By Richarde Weiss

“September and October and No-
vember creep in this petty pace from
day to day . . . and now the time of
reckoning has come.” Such seems to
be the general feeling of University
freshman on facing the grim realiza-
tion that their parents are receiving
grades today. Alibis are ﬂying thick
and fast as the ﬁrst zero hour of their
college career approaches.

This reporter, having made an ex-
tensive survey of the class, has dis-
covered that most of the students—
uh, college people——are afraid their
marks aren’t so good.

The young men contend that fra-
ternity rushing took their minds away
from work, while the young Cadies
declare there were too many welcom-
ing parties.

Some co-eds claim the professors
cause too much heart disturbance to
allow any other kind of concentration.
Generally speaking, the freshmen are
dreading the outcome of this most
momentous night, and are earnestly
wishing they could attend the recep-
tion to provide some sort of defense.

Perhaps the biggest stumbling block
for the formerly enthusiastic fresh-
men are “those darn old English
themes.”

James McHale, C, is representative
of a great majority with his state-
ment, “I’m too busy writing English
themes to bother with anything else.”

Bert Jaffe, C, comments, “I guess
the profs don’t care much for my
themes. But they're getting better.”

Adam Houman, C, isn’t sure of his
grade because he chews gum in Mr.
Hunt’s class.

Jane Call, C, claims her professors
distract her because they have too
much personality, while Erma The-
rasse, C, who dreads the worst, does
not believe, like her friends, it’s the
lipstick she uses.

Natalie Seybolt, C, threatens to do
a “Mammy Yokum.” She declares,
“If anyone ﬂunks me, I'll be out with
an axe.”

The men don’t take Ann Seaman’s
(C) mind from work. She’s used to
them; her only excuse is “the profs
just don’t understand me.”

George Hyde, C, voices public sen-
timent and explains all when he
states, “Pitt teachers are extra hard
on the ‘Freshies’.”

One admittedly “fallen” man has
been found! Asked how his grades
will be, Gerald Abels, C, replies,
“Don’t ask. I have a girl on my mind.”

Dorie Nirdinger, C, pouts, “The
profs don’t like me because they say
I’m affected, and I'm 110% really.”

Upon being asked whether she was
in favor of sending the grades home,
Georgetta Davis, C, answered, “Deﬁ-

 

Men With High Grades Say
Indifference To Coeds
Is Success Secret

 

nitely, no, because I can’t be on hand
to pull my sob-story act.” Harvey
Cupp, E, answered the same question
in a southern drawl, “It doesn't mat-
ter to me. Might as well have the
war now as later.”

Evading the subject, Andrew Can-
celliere, says, “I make no statements
for the press without consulting my
lawyer.”

To the question, “Do you think
your checks will be stopped because
of your grades?” Martin Cohen, C,
wants to know, “What checks?”

Nancy Walker, C, has a new angle.
Her hopes are high as she conﬁdes,
“I’ve been atending private confer-
ences with my profs regularly.”

Glen Rubright, C, expects to be
minus a car until after Christmas.

Last, but not important, are those
members of the “intelligentsia”—
much in the minority—-who are ex-
pecting good marks.

Miriam Wolfe, C, eats “Wheaties.”

Gino Deventur, C, Charles Ow, M,
Thomas Chalmers, E, William Crow-
ley, E, and Duane Rudge, C, are the
unsusceptible males of the class, all
of whom claim to be “getting along
because women don’t bother them in
the least.” (Note: Three are in class-
es sans females.)

Men’s Orientation
Classes To Tour
Cathedral Library

The intricacies of the University
Library will be explained to freshman
men during their orientation class on
Tuesday of next week and Thursday
of the following week when they will
be personally conducted through the
various rooms by the members of the
library staff of which J . Howard Dice
is the head.

According to Mr. Dice, each group
will be under the supervision of one
staff member who will explain to them
the methods for taking out books and
the use of each division of the library,
including the periodical, reference and
reserve book rooms.

As yet no plans have been made
for acquainting the freshman women
with the library, but Mr. Dice will
confer with the executive committee
of WSGA on Wednesday afternoon,
at which time he will suggest a simi-
lar tour for the girls.

These visits should prove a valu-
able part of freshman orientation
since many of the freshmen have been
unable to make full use of the library
because of insuﬂicient knowledge as to
its workings.

Panther Promenades I

November Issue Features
Jascha Heifetz, Carlson

By Butch
“Who was dat lady I seen you
wit’ last night?”

“That was no lady. That was the
Pitt Panther.”

(But at least this is a new method
of telling the student body that the
Panther roams again, coming out of
its den some time next week.)

Featured in November's Panther
will be an article by Jascha Heifetz,
noted concert violinist, discussing
current radio programs and the ap-
preciation of music.

“In fact,” added Miss Ir-ene Mat-
veak, editor of the magazine, “he
has an epitaph he wrote for the
punch line. You oughta see it.”

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, head bas-
ketball coach, expounds on the bas-
ket shooting of his ice cream sip-
pers. Nick Spanos writes an orgy
called “Boy Meets Girl,” an inter-
pretation of love by the masters.

In line with the recent News polls
on the men’s sentiments toward the
women and the women’s toward the
men, the Panther prints two articles.
The ﬁrst is “What the Men Claim
the Women’s Criticisms of the Men
Claim, and Why No .” The second,
“Why the Women Claim What They
Do, Claiming What the Men Claim
Is Open to Criticism.” Or sumthin’.

Short features, poetry, and the
usual departments will be included,

Cheering Block
Holds Rehearsal
For Tech Game

A special rehearsal at 4:30 o’clock
Monday afternoon has been called for
ﬁve sections of the cheering block
the key sections in forming the prowl-
ing panther, according to Louis
Bearer, E37, SFA chairman of the
block. ' .

Students in Sections U, under
Ruth Rosenthal, C38; Z, under Jack
Withum, E38; V, under Edwin Ellis,
BA39; AA, under Bernard McKen-
na, C39, and BB, under Richard
Frankel, C39, must be present at this
rehearsal. No other section members
need attend.

All members of the entire block are
expected to be in their sections by
1 :30 o’clock , on Thanksgiving Day,
Bearer said. -

“Sinceyrwe have performed credit-
able maneuvers so far,” he contin-
ued, “and since this will be our last
chance this season, we are prepared
to shoot the works, and put on our
bestshow of the year. Naturally we
must continue to have the support
of the members of the block.”

Stunts to be performed include the
prowling panther, the divided yell
formation, a ﬂashing “C”, a turkey, a
Scotchman or Scotch terrier, and the
standard “P.”

 

DeVitis To Speak

Dr. M. A. DeVitis, associate pro-
fessor of modern languages, will ad-
dress the College Club of Italian
Women, tomorrow at 3 o’clock.

Meeting in the Downtown YWCA
building on Chatham Street, the Ital-
ian Club will hear Dr. DeVitis speak
on “Modern Italian Literature."

 

Fraternities
End Silence

Tomorrow

 

Ladies of the campus fraternity
world will end the silence period of
fall rushing at noon tomorrow.

However, the suspense that is al-
ways built up by fraternities and
their prospects at rushing time will
be over for the fraternities this eve-
ning at 6 o’clock, when pledge lists
are released.

Representatives of the 15 fraterni-
ties will be given their individual
pledge list at the University Club.

Rushees returned oﬂicial ballots
designating their fraternity choice to
Heinz House this morning. Since
only second semester freshmen and
upperclass women were eligible for
fall rushing, Panhellenic Council con-
ﬁned the activities to one tea. The
results of this rushing will be an-
nounced in Monday’s News.

The plan of deferred rushing fol-
lowed at the University does not per-
mit new freshmen to be rushed until
their second semester, when they are
entertained during a three-day rush-
ing season.

The Inter-Fraternity Sing will take
place this year on November 30, on
which occasion each fraternity will
give a seven-minute skit in competi-
tion for a gold cup.

A Christmas party for all members
of Panhellenic Council is being
planned by the Council’s social com-
mittee. Further arrangements are to
be made at the next Panhellenic
Council meeting.

Law School Students Hold
Political ‘Privilege’ Suit
In Downtown Court

Frank Reich, L39, will face Russell
Connolly, L38, this evening in Com-
mon Pleas Court, defending himself
of the charge that he called Con-
nolly, an “embezz1er, a grafter, a
thief and a dirty crook.”

The slander charge is the crux of
the second mock trial, Connolly vs.
Reich, which will be held by two law
school fraternities, Phi Alpha Delta
and Tau Epsilon Rho. The case will
be tried in Judge Thomas Marshall's
court on the seventh ﬂoor of the
City-County Building.

In the brief ﬁled by attorneys for
the plaintiff, Alexander Lindsay, Jr.,
and Bryson Schreiner, L38, Reich is
accused of having “falsely, malicious-
ly, wickedly and illegally, made and
published” the slander charge.

The case in the mock trial has been
built around a statement made dur-
ing a political campaign in which
Reich and Connolly were rivals for
state treasurer. Reich portrays a
wealthy country banker.

Defendant Reich’s attorneys, Leon-
ard Marks, L38, and Aaron Lincoff,
L38, are claiming the “privilege” of
political candidates. This defense is
built upon the unwritten law that
political rivals cannot be held liable
for statements made in the heat of a
campaign.

Attorneys for the defense will have
four witnesses in their battle to prove
Reich innocent. The four are Robert
Engle, L39; Gilbert Levine, L39; Sol
Abrams. L39, and Reich himself.

Plaintiff’s witnesses are Connolly
and James B. Moore, L38; Leroy
Lewis, L38, and Harry Robinson.
L39.

As presiding judge, Attorney J.
Garﬁeld Houston, Pittsburgh lawyer,
will conduct the trial in usual court
procedure. When both sides have
completed their cases, Attorney
Houston will “charge” the jury.

Fifteen students will make up the
panel from which tonight’s jury will
be selected. Three of the ﬁfteen will

be challenged. The ﬁfteen are:
Jeanne Richardson, C40; Muriel
Lowy, C40; Miriam Harter, C40;

Howard Engelman, C38; Paul Kro-
mer, C38; Brooks Sipes, C39; Rob-
ert Stewart, C38; Howard Krell,
C39; Herbert Parnes, C39; Valeria
Grapp, C39; John Newman, C37; Es-
ther Goldhaber, C37; John Cochran.
C38; James Marquis, C38, and Nich-
olas Spanos, C38.

Magazine Staﬁ" Meets
To Decide Upon Policy

 

Editorial policy will be the sub-
ject for discussion when Irene Mat-
veak, C37, editor of The Panther,
meets with her staff on Monday, No-
vember 30, at 2:30 o’clock in the
Panther oﬂice.

Miss Matveak has named Decem-
ber 7 as the deadline for both the
December and the January issues.
The January issue will feature an
alumni theme.

ChestFund
Nets High
First Day

Incomplete Returns Indicate
721 Students Contribute
$694 Toward Goal

 

The University has made an un-
precedented start in the drive to col-
lect $11,000 as its share for the Com-
munity Fund campaign, according to
J. G. Quick, registrar and general
chairman of the campus campaign.

With only part of the ﬁrst day
solicitation counted and checked at 4
o’clock Wednesday, the report from
the treasurer was that $694.50 had
been received in contributions and
pledges from 721 students. This in-
cludes $230.25 received in cash.

This incomplete return shows that
so far the average individual contri-
bution has been one dollar. The
$694.50, Mr. Quick emphasizes, rep-
presents only the envelopes as yet
counted which had been turned in
from the canvass made during the
second hour on We-d-nesdvay. It does
not include the engineering and
mines schools, the professional
schools, or the other undengraduate
classes canvassed yesterday during
the third hour.

“Flying Squads”

Of the 25 faculty workers in the
faculty campaign, reports from ﬁve
show that $1,258 had been contrib-
uted either in cash or pledged, by 4
o’clock Wednesday. The faculty cam-
paign to raise $7,500 began on Mon-
day and ends today.

The results thus far indicate that
the Student Chest campaign this year
will be more successful than it was
last year, Mr. Quick believes.

The campaign will continue today
as the “Flying Squads” of women ac-
tivity leaders solicit all those who do
not wear a red feather indicating that
they have been canvassed. The women
will be stationed at all entrances of
State and Alumni Halls, and the Ca-
thedral.

More complete returns will be an-
nounced in the Monday issue of The
News.

Two ROTC Delegates
Leave For Convention

Alexander Leggin, C37, and How-
ard S. Auld, C37, will leave tomorrow
for Raleigh, N. C., as representatives
of the local company of Scabbard
and Blade, national honorary mili-
tary fraternity, to the national con-
vention of the society.

The meeting of the fraternity con-
venes at North Carolina State Col-
lege tomorrow and concludes with a
formal banquet Saturday evening.
Delegates and alternates from 78
companies will be present, represent-

ing all parts of the United States.

This is your last chance to “Deck
Out” before you bid farewell to your
Psych and so forth during the long
awaited Thanksgiving vacation. With
the College Assoc. dance not even a
week away, it’s hi time you started
becoming formal-minded!

Last time we were in print we in-
troduced you to Larry Kaye, remem-
ber? His smart shop is located at
534 Smithﬁeld Street. In addition to
carrying clever frocks, millinery,
sportswear and coats, he also carries
formals and Sunday nite frocks plus
velvet evening wraps with furred col-
lars. Mama’s little glamour girl can’t
help but sparkle if she arrays herself
in this one particular white, pussy-
willow crepe formal. The low en-
velope decolletage is studded with
rhinestones, bares the shoulders, and
ﬁve tiny straps do the “holding-up.”

A ﬁve-inch split in the center of the
front skirt breaks the dead white
monotony. Then, too, the rhinestone
studded long-sleeved jacket will make
your formal do double duty. For all
this glamour and glitter you simply
pay 17.50, and lo and behold, the
formal is yours!

:1: *

With the coming of winter, what is
so heavenly-warm as a soft cashmere
sweater or twin sweater set? The
Trousseau Shop is well supplied with
all colors and sizes in these soft, com-
fortable sweaters. For more dressy
occasions, just clasp a double strand
of pearls, gold or silver beads around
your neck, and wear a bracelet to

match. The lovely lustered pearls are
priced at three dollars and look far
more than their price. Speaking of
pearls, we know of nothing better to
top off a formal with than a pearl
Juliet cap. This, too, will set you
back only three dollars, and will be
well worth it when you prove to your-
self what a Fair Lady you can be!
The address—4010 Fifth Avenue, in
the Schenley Apartments.

“To err is human.” In the previous
column in describing that “Hail to
Pitt” blue and gold formal, through
some error we neglected to give the
name of the shop at which you might
look at this formal and many others.
We’re sorry. However, lest you may
have forgotten, the formal is Coro-
nation blue trimmed with gold bind-
ing. The gold runs down the front
of the dress, around the ﬂared skirt
and binds the daring low back. The
jacket has a ﬂared peplum, hi neck-
line, and long sleeves. The bows at
the neck are sure beau catchers. The
shop——the Wardrobe, 190 N. Craig
Street; the price—29.75. Other for-
mals start from 17.50. If it’s not a
formal you’re in need of, their street
dresses suit any person and occasion.

If you didn’t get a free manicure
as yet, it’s because you haven’t been
down to Bede1l’s on Fifth Avenue,
near Wood Street, to look at their
selection of hats. For dress, small
hats are THE thing. The hats this
season go off at all rakish angles,
feathers may pop up anywhere, and
Turkish turbans add that air of mys-
ticism. The prices are moderate
enough for the average coed, and the
styles are smart enough for the very
sophisticated coed. When you think
of a new hat think of Bedell’s, and
when you think of Bede1l’s remember
that you’ll get a manicure absolutely

free.

Korean Speaker
Tells YM-YWCA
Of Cooperatives

 

Development of a consumers’ co-
operative movement is progressing in
Korea, according to Mrs. Induk Pak,
Korean sociologist, in her address
Monday evening to the YM-YWCA
upperclass club.

Explaining living conditions in Ko-
rea, Mrs. Pak said, “Eighty-two out
of every 100 Koreans are farmers, but
75 out of these 82 are tenants. Be-
cause of the poverty of most of these
people, the cooperative movement
started and is now making headway.
“Out of the proﬁts of cooperative
buying and selling, Korean villages
set aside 10 per cent for maintaining
schools, and divide the rest among
the members on the share basis,”
Mrs. Pak stated.

Varsity Cross-Country Team Meets Navy At Annapolis
Tomorrow As Freshman Gridders Terminate Season
With Battle Against Middie Plebes

While an open football date spreads silence over the Pitt
Stadium, Annapolis, Maryland, will get a chance to watch Pan-

ther athletic systems in action

as two Panther teams, varsity,

cross-country and frosh football, act as guests of Navy tomor-

row afternoon.

Pitt’s varsity cross-country team
goes over the last hill tomorrow when
the Olsonmen challenge the Navy
harriers over the Annapolis course in
the Panthers’ ﬁnal dual meet of the
season.

Torpedoing in earnest, the Pan-
thers will be out for a victory in or-
der to close out a successful dual sea-
son and to help forget about an “oif
day” they had last Monday. In dual
competition Pitt has been only beaten
once, that time by the national cham-
pions, Michigan State.

Navy Wants Revenge

Navy was the ﬁnal team that the
Panthers ran against last year and
Pitt rolled out an 18-37 victory over

the Schenley Park course, Pitt’s home
grounds.

First in that meet was Harold Tost,
a junior from Plumville, Pa. Tost is
a senior this year and has been the
Pitt low man, leading the Pitt pack
in almost every meet. George Cook.
a Tost classmate, was second. Third
place went to Cecil Bolam of the
Navy.

These three runners will scamper
around the Navy course tomorrow
afternoon. Other Pitt runners to
make the bus trip, which began at 8
o’clock this morning, are Alex Leg-
gin, Al Zamborski, Bob Follette, Ray
Nordstrom, Frank Bonurati and Ed-
ward Novak, manager.

Coach Carl Olson will remain in
Pittsburgh to handle the state inter-
scholastics that the University is
sponsoring. Assistant Coach James
Potts will direct the group in his ab-
sence.

Frosh Footballers Close Season

In another season ﬁnale at the same
place and at the same time, Coach
Mike Milligan’s Panther Cub grid-
ders battle the Middie plebes in their
annual game. The Little Admirals
enter the game as fav-orites and with
grim intent to make up for the 33-7
shellacking by last year’s Pitt fros-h.

After a shutout at the hands of
the Mountaineers at Fairmont, Ar-
mistice Day, 20-0, the yearlings are
all set for a comeback at the expense
of the Annapolis gridders.

There will be little difference in
the little Panther lineup when they
tackle the Miniature Middies. Dick-
inson, captain of the team, who has
been playing a great game at right
end, will hold that position tomor-
row, Farkus is slate-d for the oppo-
site end of the line. Foltz and Kris-
tufek appear at the tackle posts,
while Shord at center and Corace
and Pennypacker at guards ﬁnish off
a 17 9-pound average line.

Backﬁeld assignments are also the
same as for the West Virginia tilt,
with Goodell at fullback, Cassiano
and Pastin at halfback, and Marie at
quarterback.

CE’s Want ‘Real’ Game

Civil engineers issue a challenge
that they will play “honest-to-gosh”
football with any team at all. They
may be reached in the Civil Engineer-
ing oﬂice, -Room 1810, Cathedral.

Schricker Seeks
More Boxing Candidates

WANTED——By Jack Schricker,
boxing coach, at least ten more
boxing candidates, heavyweights
preferred. And there lies the only
drawback in the ring mentor’s fast-
moving training program.

“As usual there is a scarcity in
the heavier divisions,” said Schrick-
er yesterday, “but aspirants for all
classes will ﬁnd themselves in a
wide open battle for positions.”

He requested that all new men
report to the Stadium quarters
any afternoon after 2:30 o'clock.

 

Kappa Sigs
Win Phi Ep
Battle, 15-6

Tilt With Phi Delts, Last
Year Champs, Monday
Ends Semi-Finals

Intramural oﬁlcials ﬁnally brought
the Kappa Sig and the Phi Ep touch
football teams together for their long
delayed second round gridiron bat-
tle. During the long delay or some-
where in the shuffle, the Phi Ep boys
lost something after their tie game
with the Kappa Sigs last week, for
over in the Schenley Oval Tuesday
afternoon the Kappa Sigs proved
themselves strictly money players by
whipping the Phi Eps, 15-6.

It was another one of those typi-
cal Phi Ep-Kappa Sig classics. On
the opening play of the game, Phi
Ep Jack Young tossed a long pass
to Jack Kotler to put the ball deep
in Kappa Sig territory. From here
Mac Marks riﬂed a short pass to
Young, who scampered‘ over the goal
for Phi Ep’s six points.

Three Minutes To Play!

This seemed to make the Dithridge
Street lads mad. A few minutes later
Charley Groat, Kappa Sigma’s All-
Frat candidate, turned left end for
the tying touchdown, and the game
stayed tied until three minutes before
the ﬁnal whistle of the game, when
Kappa Sigma turned on the power
and scored nine points in quick
fashion.

Up to the ﬁnal three minutes the
two teams had played 77 minutes of
touch football to a tie score, includ-
ing last Week’s tie game. Groat
started the rally and provided the
winning points when he intercepted
a Phi Ep pass and ran 50 yards for
a touchdown. Andy Moffet made the
extra point. Two more Kappa Sig
points came on the following play.

Monday the Kappa Sigs meet the
Phi Delts in the semi-ﬁnal of their
league. The winner of this game will
battle the Phi Gains, the other league
winner, in the ﬁnals on Tuesday aft-
ernoon.

Cage Drills At Stadium

 

Squad Ends First Week’s
Workout; Varsity Wins
Practice Game

 

About thirty or forty ambitious
freshmen, dressed in shorts and jer-
seys, strolled out on the Stadium gym
court last Monday afternoon to re-
port to Coach Paul Zehfuss for fresh-
man basketball practice. Although
the varsity has been in shorts and
jerseys for several weeks, Monday
was the ﬁrst session for the yearling
cagers.

The squad will be cut to one small
enough for Zehfuss, sole coach for the
ﬁrst year men, to handle. He hopes
to have the group cut by the end of
Thanksgiving vacation into a tenta-
tive squad.

The frosh held practice Tuesday
and Thursday and will have another
session today. Next week practice
will fall on Tuesday, and Friday and
Saturday mornings to be followed the
week after Thanksgiving by practice
on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Some of the freshman candidates
showing form are Louis Mendlow, of
Duquesne; Jimmy McCance, Bellevue;
Bill Edmunds, Dormont; Matt Null,
Sykesville; Bob Johnson, Swissvale;
George Wood, Kane; George Hart-
man, Homestead; Howard Lyons,

Crafton; Jim Shaffer, New Castle;

Charles Ptacek, Pittsburgh; Jack
Scherer, Glassport; Dan McCarthy,
St. .Mary’s of the Mount; George
Davies, Wilkinsburg; Joe Kristufek,
McKeesport; Francis Vernallis, Bent-
leyville, and Dave Saunders of Pitts-
burgh. Most of these fellows played
high school ball and were entered in
Carlson’s recent novice tournament.

_Pitt’s varsity has been clicking
right along, playing their ﬁrst prac-
tice game last Tuesday evening up in
the Stadium court when it met and
defeated the Wilmerding A. C., a fast
local amateur club. It will probably
have another practice game on next
Tuesday to be followed by one a
week later. The opponents have not
yet been decided upon.

Thls Practice fray was not the
ﬁrst workout they have had as a team
as they have been having inter-club
contests for the past two weeks. Dr.
Carlson has been dividing his squad
of eleven men into two squads for the
inter-club tilts in an effort to ﬁnd a
combination that will work well to-
gether. The eleven men playing are
Bill J esko, Luke Rowe, Frank Loucks,
Joe Garcia, Miles Zeleznick, Rags
Radvansky, and Bob Johnson, all
lettermen in the cage game, and
Red Scott, Joe Fabel, Sam Lindsay,
and Ed Lawry from last year’s fresh-
man crew. Ed Spotovich, a veteran
0f the '35 quintette, is not playing
this year.

First In Panther Rim

Weather cold enough to make the
Panther run did just that yesterday
afternoon for Martin J. Feely’s sec-
ond annual Panther Run. The results
of the Run sounds like an all-frater-
nity convention for, after ruling out
freshman cross -country runners as
ineligible, Greeks alone remained.

First place went to Fred Treden-
nick, PiKA who completed the circuit
in something under seven minutes.
Ken Ryden, sole Delt to run, followed
close behind, while Dorand, Lambda
Chi dogged him to wind up in the
third position. Heuple, another PiKA,
helped their team points by tallying
fourth. The Kappa Sigs believe in stay-
ing together and it must be a good
idea for they again cinched the team
cup by placing the next four men.
Ed Beachler, Gordy Rauch, Bell, and
Jim Shields crossed the ﬁnish line in
that order for the honor of Kappa
Sigma. Bill Hoeveler came in a lucky
13th to complete the team and run

the Kappa Sig points to a total of

39.
Placing ﬁve men in the ﬁrst twen-

ty to ﬁnish put the Lambda Chis in

second place with 53 points. PiKA,

I'll Take Two Lumps, Please!

TONIGHT THE REPUTED cream of the University mixes
with perhaps one of the more important outside factors of any
University. Starting at eight o’clock, Dr. John G. Bowman, ad-
ministration and faculty supplementing, stages quite an affair atop
Memorial Hall for the parents of freshmen, gathered there. Up-
perclassmen and women, with more cream, participate and will
perhaps even stir a little sugar in the direction of a few faculty
booths, provided they are within dunking range.

Most of the sugar, however, will be saved for the guests of
the evening, the parents. It will all be very ﬁne, from the back-
less formals of lovely girls with cake, cream, and perhaps even a
little tea or coffee—to the boys who are lucky enough to catch a
dusky corner position in mid—balcony.

But we all like sugar, especially if our coffee has been roasted,
toasted, boasted. Ephraim and Merebell have perhaps passed
through just that process. Upperclassmen, for the most part, con-
ducted the roasting parties for the Ephraims and Merebells with
perhaps even a few toasting parties were staged for the former
during the recent rush period.

Most freshmen, single-handedly, took care of the last process,
boasting, with a personal delight. However, most of them have
passed through the “grinder.” If they have been well ground, then
their kettles shall have “perked” and perhaps be ready for a bit
of sugar. .

But if the “grounds” are still hard and rough, they will be
put on a really hot ﬁre or may be shoved through a ‘ﬁne grinder
when parents step in for their share of the inquisition procedure.

We hope most parents ﬁnd their Epes and Meres with full
cups that are ready for sweetening—to mix with the cream. _How-
ever, to those who perhaps may feel a lump rise slowly in the
throat when the messages arrive, as contrasted to'those who may
be able to drink a lump that slowly dissolves as it is taken, we say
there is still much time. . . . _

Often a freshman ﬁnds it difficult to become adjusted to the
shifting, changing life of the ﬁrst-year student. A senior.year
in high school is sometimes poor preparation for what is to
come in the ﬁrst year of college. The transition may be slowed
by the backwardness or forwardness of the freshman. In other
cases, the circumstances are uncontrollable. Background often
is lacking. Until some of that has been secured through periods
of orientation, research, or. special training, the road is rough.

It is not the most satisfactory thing to learn that your son
does not, at the present time, measure up to others in his group.
This may be due to lack of ability, but in nine—tenths of _the cases
can be traced to lack of preparation, study, or concentration. Per-
haps an outside inﬂuence is responsible for ‘the situation. If work,
that is excess work, is necessary ‘to provide_an opportunity for
attendance, then it is questionable if the cost is worthwhile. It is
worth the health and effort of only a few exceptions to pay the
cost of excessive outside employment. _ . _

It is a big job to make the most of what our Universities and
Colleges offer today. Students entering the tercentenary year of
this University should be well aware of that fact. However, a
school can only offer opportunity to learn. Students must ﬁrst of
all desire to learn, and then do something constructive about that
desire.

One other point, many times a student earning a “C” in a
course receives more than the “A” student for the same work.
The thing is relative, and depends a great deal on the individual.
Average work represents good work for a large percentage of the
ﬁrst-year class. Above-average usually indicates superior_-attain-
merit, yet may not be a criterion as to what has been received.

There is still a great deal of time for an acceptable ﬁnish. Re-
member, there are many who get.alor.ig admirably well in this world
without any sugar. And they like it . . . that way.

No Greek Chapter Here

HEN THERE'S the one about the freshman who, after viewing

the University’s 41-story Cathedral of Learning school house,
breezed into the lobby of Hotel Schenley, next door,”and told the
clerk that while he “hadn’t met all the fellows yet he thought
he’d like “to pledge up, anyhow,” since he’d taken such a liking
to the place.”

H-mmm, Yes, Those Papers I Owe You!

LONG ABOUT THIS time many of us are in much the same

shape as the immortal Dean, the “Dizzy” one, who after being
“beaned” by a hot belt from the bat of the Philly’s Watkins last
summer, awoke in the dressing room several minutes later with the
classic, “Why ain’t I pitchin’?”

Vocal Unit

Performs

 

Singers Of Negro Spirituals
From School Of Music
Entertain Students

By Robert Brown

Some reviewers have a habit of
exhausting all of the adjectives in the
English language to describe con-
certs. But practically all that need
be said about the performance of the
Cardwell Singers presented here last
Wednesday is that it fully measured
up to everything that was expected
of it.

There was little doubt in the minds
of the 150 students who heard Mary
Cardwell Dawson and her choral so-

ciety from the Cardwell School of
Music that the group was “tops” in
its particular ﬁeld——interpreting Ne-
gro spirituals.

Sound Musical Taste

In its presentation of the old songs
of the Negro race there was evi-
dent good, sound musical taste, deli-

gcate shading, well balanced program

notes, proper subordination of solo
parts, and a wise selection of nuin—
bers. In fact, the only ﬂaw appar-
ent was a slight intonality evident
in Stephen Collins Foster’s “Come
Where My Love Lies Dreaming,” but
this was such a triﬂing matter that
only a musical purist would ﬁnd any
fault with it.

The number most popular with the
audience was, perhaps, Mrs. Dawson’s
“Great Gettin’ Up In the Mornin’.”
The sure swing of the music and
the enthusiasm which the choral
showed in the presentation of it made
a sure-ﬁre hit with everyone present.

Women Score Hit

But the other numbers were all
equally well done. The Women’s sec-
tion of the society scored with Jack-
son’s “Certainly, Lord,” and the ever
popular “Joshua at the Battle of Jer-
icho” was built up to a close that
made observers wonder that 14 sing-
ers could achieve such stirring ef-
fects. The simple yet effective chord-
ing of “Deep River” conclusively
proved once more that true music
need not be a vacant display of vir-
tuosity.

I still have two inches of copy left,
so it might not be amiss to congratu-
late William Stark, C38, in particular,
and SFA, in general, for initiating the
new series of concert hours and book
chats that struck a new high in cul-
tural activities at the University, if
the Cardwell Singers are to be taken
for an example. They are sure to
be well received by the student body.

Letter To
Editors __

November 18, 1936.
Editor, The Pitt News,
Dear Sir:

I write this letter in a spirit of pro-
test. I considered a long time before
ldoing so, for fear of adding my name
Ito the list of cranks, quacks, and those
¢0tll€1“»\'lSe mentally deﬁcient who like
‘to see their “John Doe” in print. But
{the time is past for personal consid-
lerations; I speak now for the good
 )f the group.

Winter is at hand. From three
years’ experience, I have noticed
among the students and faculty of
this University a deplorable habit of
sealing themselves hermetically in
the classrooms with windows shut and
,dOOl' closed. While the professor pro-
ceeds in his lecture, some 50 students

inhale, exhale with painful regular-
ity. By this count of noses, it would
seem that the professor fails to take
part in this natural function.

He seems unaware of the fact that
as the hour progresses, the supply of
good air in the room decreases; as
the supply of good air decreases,
scholarship lags, even in the midst of
some frenzy of inspiration. I have
come into the rooms where the win-
dows have been so misted I have been
unable to see out, and where the air
has been so fetid and poor, that it
took real courage to cross the ﬂoor to
open the windows.

I have been in class rooms where,
because of the heat and the thick
atmosphere, I have become so drowsy
and stupid that I could barely keep
my eyes open.

Now I ask you: Is this an intelli-
gent way to meet our common prob-
lem? There is no proper ventilating
system to provide for an intake of
fresh air nor for an outlet of stale
air. Then, must we necessarily “stew
in our own juice” because some in-
structor fails to provide a proper ad-
justment of the windows? I, myself,
would hate to break into his lecture
to remind him of his duty, but I can’t
stand much more of present condi-
tions. That is why I write this letter
—in hopes of getting some sort of
united action.

What has become of our health
service? While warning us against
colds, they are supinely indifferent to
this pernicious factor that only in-
creases our susceptibility.

And you too, Mr. Editor. Could you
for one day, at least, turn from your
campaign for united action in the
cheering section to a drive for a sane
and healthier atmosphere in the
classroom? Better yet, could you give
us of your services a whole week in
which to make the campus “air
minded”? This would indeed be a real,
constructive service.

Sincerely yours,
RAY MAIZE, ’38.

Coed Welcome Events

Final Event In Series To Introduce Freshman Women
To Student Life Sponsored By Women’s Choral,
Debating Association at Heinz House

 

Climaxing a series of events intro-
ducing freshman women to Univer-
sity life, the Women’s Debating As-
sociation and Women’s Choral enter-
tained at the annual Beaux Arts
Salon Wednesday night at Heinz
House.

Mr. Peter Joray, who traveled over
from the Pittsburgh Playhouse, and
Miss Georgia Orwig, well known in
Pittsburgh music circles, were guest
artists for the evening. Mr. Joray
presented several character sketches
and Miss Orwig, piano selections.

The guests were introduced by Miss
Theresa Kahn, instructor in English
and coach of Women’s Debating, who
also talked on ﬁne arts. Student en-
tertainers were June Greene, Ed38,
and Peggy Donley, C39, dancers.
Members of Women’s Choral sang
two groups of songs.

‘hostess to the ﬁrst year women at the
‘Coed Pi-om. Dressed in summer for-
mals which would make the Parisiar.
fashioner sit up and take notice, and
escorted by upperclassmen attired in
the latest according to Esquire, they
gathered at the University Club to
enjoy the evening of entertainment
and dancing and to vie for honors by
wearing blue and gold crepe paper
hats which they had designed and
made themselves.

Of a more serious nature was the
‘Hearth Ceremony. This ceremony,
patterned after one of ancient Rome,
signiﬁes the kindling of inextinguish-
able friendship. It marked the light-
ing of the ﬁre in the Heinz House
ﬁreplace for the ﬁrst time this year
and was the welcome accorded to
freshman women by the YWCA and
YWHA.

The ﬁrst freshman event, and prob-

of the traditional ceremonies, was
Lantern Night which took place the
ﬁrst Wednesday night of the semes-
ter. Freshman women, with their
mentors, gathered on Thaw Hall
green to watch the ritual of light and
to be welcomed into the University by
Father Pitt.

Following this ceremony, the women
lighted their candles from the tapers
of the candlebearers and proceeded up
University Drive to Heinz House
where with Alma Mater they took
part in a ritual in which they pledged
loyalty to the University. This was
W SGA’s welcome to the class of 1940.
