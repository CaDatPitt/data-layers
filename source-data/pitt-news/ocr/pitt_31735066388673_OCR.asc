Managing Editor

Craig Jackson promised "to
continue the work of the many
worthwhile projects initiated
by the 1987 Board” when he
formally took over the position
of Student Government Board
president Thursday evening.

"We have entered a partner-
ship with the students,” said
Jackson, speaking on behalf of
himself and the other eight
members of the new SGB,
elected last November.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
briefly addressed the au-
dience. ”The student leader-
ship of the university is a
critical element You young
people are very important to
us,” said Posvar.

Conney Kimbo, vice presi-
dent of Student Affairs, also

Jackson to continue
current SGB policy

spoke, advising the new board
to ’’always get the facts before
making a decision." Kimbo
remarked that the Student
Government Board plays an
independent and vital role in
the shared government of this
university.

Outgoing president Phil
Moyer gave his farewell ad-
dress to the student leaders
and administrators who were
in attendance.

”Our rewards have been
great,” said Moyer, commend-
ing each member of the out-
going board individually for
their efforts this past year.

Outgoing members of the
SGB are: Vince Altomare, Fi-
ora Boehm, Rosemary
Cardone, Amy Danziger, Ge-
orge Kontos_, Melanie Naro,

Superfund money misspent, audit claims

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —- When

I Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey

took office one year ago, he in-
herited a state Superfund toxic
waste cleanup effort that, accord-
ing to a federal audit, had not
lived up to its own billing.

In fact, the audit said, Pennsyl-
vania failed for more than two
years to use $6 million in Super-
fund money and misled the pub-
lic by boasting about its
aggressiveness in cleaning up
hazardous waste.

It is not ‘surprising, then, that
environmental officials in Harris-

burg tend to blame the shape of _

the program on the Republican
administration of Gov. Dick
Thornburgh, who left office at the
end of 1986 after two terms.
Casey, a Democrat, was inaugu-
rated in January of 1987.

The audit, completed late in
1987 by the federal Environmen-
tal Protection Agency's inspector
general’s office, covered from
July 1986 through March 1987.
It maintained Pennsylvania did
not aggressively pursue parties
responsible for hazardous waste

problems and that the state was

”indecisive” in dealing with con- -

tractors to handle the cleanups.

"That was pre-Gov. Casey,”
said Department of Environmen-
tal Resources spokeswoman Su-
san Woods, when asked last
week about the audit's claim that
the state was slow to-sign cleanup
contracts. ”It's difficult to speak
for a previous administration,”
she said.

But Nicholas DeBenedictis,
Thornburgh's DER secretary dur-
ing the period in question, said
an institutional problem hampers
Pennsylvania's ability to make
the Superfund program work as
it was intended.

Without procedural changes,
he suspects similar problems may
persist in the Casey years.

"It’s not a Republican-
Democratic issue. It's a
bureaucratic issue,” DeBenedic-
tis said last week in a telephone
interview from the Greater
Philadelphia Chamber of Com-
merce, of which he is "president.

An accidentclaimed the life of

The three were traveling in a

Road in Hempfield Township at

2:20 a.m., when their car failed
to negotiate a turn in the road and

the money by demonstrating in-
dividual ’ sites could cause
hazardous substances to’ be
released into groundwater, sur-
face water or the air.

Under the program, states are
supposed to track down individu-
als or companies responsible for
the problem. The polluters can be
forced to clean the site or pay for
the cleanup. In the meantime,
states often hire contractors to
conduct studies defining the
scope of the problem and recom-
mending a plan of action.

”What EPA did was they
delegated the program, but all the
monies and contracts still had to
be approved by them," De-
Benedictis said. ’’I don't think it‘
was the people, it was that you
couldn't get the contracts
through.”

"It's such a complicated issue
that you get lawyers representing
the possible people responsible
[for the waste], lawyers represent-
ing the state, the contractor and
the federal government. Then
you negotiate and negotiate and

body makes a decision, you get

tion at Presbyterian Hospital.
Both survivors were Life Flighted

Superfund—related lawsuits typi-
cally involve polluters’ question-
ing their liability for a cleanup,
contractors wondering why they
were not picked or environmen-
talists objecting to planned waste
disposal methods.

Often, the delay in signing con-

tracts to begin studies or cleanup .

work at Pennsylvania sites was
the result of disputes between
DER and its selected contractors,
the audit said.

”DER has not lived up to its
promises to the public since 1984
about when the studies would
start,” the audit said. "Likewise,
DER sought to transfer the blame
for the delays to the federal
government."

But DeBenedictis said: "Each
Superfund site is unique. It's not
as simple as saying we were sit-
ting around doing nothing.”

Casey has proposed astate pro-
gram to supplement the federal
Superfund effort and address
more sites. ”We are fairly confi-
dent that when the Legislature

gets back at the end of the month,

it will be a top priority,” said

shot in
Student
Union

By Frances Sansig
and William Young

The Pitt News ,
A University of Pittsburgh stu-

dent remains in serious condition

at Presbyterian University Hospi-
tal after receiving a gun shot
wound under his arm Saturday
night.

Andra Mullings, 19, was at a
party sponsored by the Phi Beta
Sigma fraternity when he was
shot by Marvin White, 19, of Lin-
coln Place in the assembly room
of the William Pitt Union.

“There was a. shooting last
night [Saturday],” said Mary Ann
Aug of Pitt's News and Publica-
tions Bureau. "The perpetrator is
in custody.”

Charges against White include
reckless endangerment, aggravat-
ed assault and criminal trespass.
He is being jailed in lieu of
$25,000 band.

In addition, Panther football

player and Heisman trophy can-g

didate Craig Heyward was arrest-
ed and charged with simple
assault, resisting arrest and dis-
orderly conduct after refusing to
leave the scene of the incident.

Heyward is scheduled for a city
court hearing Thursday after be.-
ing released on nominal bond.

According to Dan Talbert, an
employee of the William Pitt Un-
ion who was working at the in-.
formation desk at the time of the
incident (approximately 12:30
a.m.), "People just started pour-
ing out of the door [of the assem-
bly room]. They all ran up to the
desk, and everybody just stayed
here.

"I asked what was going on,
and a man said, ’Someone’s been
shot.’ Paul Carrick [another WPU
employee] called the police. The
guy who was shot came running
out with his hand on his shoul-
‘der. lcould see powder burns. I

don't even think he realized he'd ‘

been shot until he saw the
blood,” said Talbert.

Talbert said he did not hear the
shot go off. "I heard other peo-
ple say it just sounded like some-
one broke a chair.”

’ "I was in the back counting
money," said Carrick, ”and peo-
ple came out screaming and say-
ing that someone had been shot.”

Carrick also said that at most
fraternity parties held in the
WPU, "something happens  a
minor altercation usually. The
guys [Phi Beta Sigma] were being
perfect gentlemen until this hap-
pened, though."

Suburban

PITTSBURGH — A subu_rban
water company opened its

' pumps Sunday for the first time

in a week following an oil spill
in an effort to bring relief to 200
customers enduring dry spigots.

”This is the best news I've ever
had in my life,'’ said Joe Wiesner,
general manager of the Robinson
Township Water Authority.

-”There’s been tremendous im-

provement, but we're asking peo-
ple to conserve water for another
day until we fill our storage
tanks." ‘

Robinson shut its 1.5 million-
gallon intake last Sunday after an
Ashland Oi|..,Co. tank ruptured
and polluted the Monongahela
‘and Ohio rivers with diesel fuel.
The pump roared to life at 12:45
p.m. Sunday.

At the height of the crisis,
23,000 customers were without

I water. The last homes to receive

water were in North Fayette

A Township, where g 8,000 cus-

tomers are served.

”It’s been a pain. It's been an
inconvenience all around,” said
Charlene Rozman, a mother of
two teen-age children in North
Fayette Township. ’’I was never

   

water companyreactivates pumps 

meant to be a pioneer.”

Until the intake reopened,
water trickled into the system
from pipelines jury-rigged to two
neighboring water companies.
The intake is in a back channel,
and oil from the spill has not
oozed downriver like it has in
other areas, officials said.

Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania
Emergency Management Agency
will meet Monday at 11:30 a.m.,
when a decision will be made on
lifting a mandatory conservation
order.

”We still have oil in the river
and an unstable situation,” PEMA
directorjoseph LaFleur said in ex-
plaining why the order remained
in effect over the weekend.

Panamanian head sets
trap for opposition
PANAMA CITY, Panama -

Strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio-

Noriega returned Sunday after a
one-day trip to Santo Domingo
that sparked joyful demonstra-
tions at home by opponents who
thought he would never come
back, officials said.

Noriega, who has been under
pressure from Washington to
ease his grip on power, reported-
ly said the unannounced trip was
aimed at testing reaction by his
opponents at home and in the
United States.

In the Dominican Republic,
Noriega was quoted by the Listin
Diario newspaper Sunday as say-
ing his trip was a ploy to see how
the Panamanian opposition and
the United States would react.

’’It was a trap I set to test their
honesty,” he said.

Attorney says judge
didn't take any bribes

PHILADELPHIA — Common
Pleas Court Judge Kenneth S.
Harris never took money to fix
cases during 1986, but his aide
and several friends may have
done so without his knowledge,
according to Harris’ attorney.

In his opening statement in
Harris’ federal racketeering and
extortion trial, attorney Samuel C.
Stretton laid the blame squarely
on his client's co—defendants: per-
sonal aide , Conrad Cheeks, a
government witness, and associ-
ate Matthias ”Big Sonny” Brown.

”The defense contention, the
evidence will show, is thatludge
Harris  was not aware that his
aide, Conrad Cheeks, or his
friends were involved in fixing

cases,” Stretton told the j_ury.

Group fights for gay rights

By Frances Sansig
hhmumgﬁﬂmr

The University of Pittsburgh's
Gay and Lesbian Alliance is
ready for ACTION.

ACTION is the acronym for the

‘ Action Committee To Include

Sexual Orientation to the Non-

' discrimination Policy of the

University. The group is a sub-

committee of Pitt Gala and GRO,

the Gay Rights Organization
based in the Pitt Law School.
The grassroots group consists of
students, alumni and teaching
staff, and may soon include te-
nured faculty members, accord-

'ing to Joel Rapoport, a member

of ACTION. <

”We are [planning to] present
a formal letter or proposition to
the university senate. What we
need to do is get a broad base of
support  before we formally ask
the university administration to
do this,” said Rapoport.

The group met last November
with Maryann Bishop Coffey,
head of Affirmative Action at Pitt,
in what Rapoport described as a
”positive experience.” But the
group's efforts are still in the plan-
ning stages-

One way the group plans to ac-
complish this is to harness sup-
port from the Student
Government Board. Rapoport is
scheduled to meet with SGB
president Craig Jackson this Wed-
nesday to discuss the matter.

”We want SGB to pass a reso-
Iution that sexual orientation
should be included in the non-
discrimination policy,” he said.

Another course of action they
are undertaking is collecting per-

Rapoport said ACTION has been
circulating a letter requesting
documentation of campus dis-
crimination.

» ”We want people to write to
us, and they can tell us who they
are, so we can attest to the ad-
ministrators while witholding
their names if they like,” he said.

We've been told by
administrators that the
university does not dis-
crimina te against sexu-
al orientation  But
there's an intense
difference between in-
stitutional posturing
and individual attitude.

— loel Rapoport
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-I

Rapoport said he and the other
members of ACTION firmly be-
lieve the University of Pittsburgh
has substantial reason to make
the amendment. '

”Pitt has always said they're
committed to human rights and
equality,” he said. In addition,
Rapoport noted a number of

notable learning institutions who
have such policies, including

‘Harvard, Yale and the Universi-

ty of Pennsylvania, in addition to
Pennsylvania state schools. ’’It
would make it a legal precedent
if Pitt were to do this,” said
Rapoport. Pitt is not a state

state funding. .

”Another reason is that the Pitt
Men's Study is a pioneer in AIDS
research. We believe they [the
university] have a responsibility
to take a strong stance,” he said.

Rapoport said he is ”expect—
ing” the policy to be instituted
within three semesters, by April
of 1989.

The current non-discrimination
policy reads: The University of
Pittsburgh, as an educational in-
stitution and as an employer,
does not discriminate on the ba-
sis of race, color, religion, ethnic-
ity, national origin, age, sex,
marital, veteran, or handicapped
status. This is a commitment
made by the university and is in
accordance with federal, state
and local laws and regulations.

”Every group included in the
equal rights statement has fought
for it,” said Rapoport. ”We’ve
been told by administrators that

.the university does not ,dis—

criminate against sexual orienta-
tion. We believe. But there's an
intense difference between in-
stitutional posturing and individu-
al attitude.” I

Some Pitt students say they be-
lieve the policyis unnecessary
but would still support it. A

”They don't need it. I don't
think it would really help if there
were incidents of sexual orienta-
tion discrimination. I would sup-
port it, though, because I think it's
important to have equal ‘rights. I
just don't think it's worth the trou-
ble,” said Lyn Benton, a freshman
engineering major.

Reactions  

patients differ from
student to student

By Michael Elko

For The Pitt News

When it was recently an-
nounced by Pittsburgh public
school superintendent Richard
Wallace that a student with
AIDS is attending classes in
the school system, questions

_were raised concerning the

way to handle such a matter.
Wallace has assured the
public that the student is a

responsible adult who knows’

how to avoid spreading the

disease and will not partici- .

pate in activities that pose a
risk to other students.

Pat Crawford, public infor-
mation officer and spokes-
woman for the school district,

saidthere was a reason for the ‘

announcement and the deci-
sion to keep the student's
identity a secret.

’’It would be disastrous if
this information came out
through the gossip mill. We
might be accused of a
coverup. We wanted the pub-

lic to be aware that we are.

very much aware of the AIDS
epidemic and that the district
has a policy in place, and we
are enacting it,” said
Crawford.

The policy, one of the first
in the state, was approved in
1985 and states that informa-

tion about AIDS-infected in-
dividuals shall not be
disclosed to the general
public.

9 ”I’m pleased to announce
there have been no witch-
hunts. The students talked
about it for a day and then got
on with their usual business,”
said Crawford.

The school district's han-
dling of the situation has been
praised by various organiza-
tions, including the Pittsburgh
Federation of Teachers.

Dennis Donham, assistant
vice president of Student Af-
fairs at the University of Pitts-

‘burgh, concurs. ’’I think he

[Wallace] handled the situa-
tion very well.” The universi-
ty’s policy on AIDS has been
in effect since March 10,
1986. It makes no mention of
public disclosure concerning
an AIDS—infected student, staff
or faculty member. .
Donham said he does not
rule out the possibility of an
AIDS—infected individual on
campus nor the possibility that
an infected person has quiet-
ly dropped out, but said, ”To
the best of my knowledge, not

‘one case of AIDS has been '

reported to the university 
”That is not to say we are
not concerned and haven't

The first Healthsource group
session is an overall education
process. A slide presentation is
shown describing their various
symptoms and treatments such as
a change in diet and exercise. Fa-
mily members, husbands and
boyfriends are invited to ‘par-
ticipate.

"We've had everyone from an
11-year-old child to mothers‘ of
the patients in their late 405,"
said Dr. Thoft. "This is important
because people think it's all in a
woman's head."

The second session is devoted
to explaining the benefits’ of a
change in diet. ”Most women do

not eat right," Dr- Thoft said.
"We have them cut out caffeine,
sugar, alcohol and salt.” Reduc-
ing these substances can alleviate
certain symptoms.

Exercise is the topic of the third
session. "There is a clear ration-
ale for recommending exercise,"
said Dr. Thoft. "There is ample
literature on why exercise helps
physiologically and emotional-
ly.” Studies show that exercise
helps alleviate depression and
anxiety.

”Some women,” explained Dr.
Thoft, ”think they can buy a self-
help book and conquer it them-

I selves.”

around. We would‘ also ensure
that precautions were taken to
protect the health and safety of
other students,” said Donham.

Pitt students had a mixed reac-
tion about knowing a friend or
fellow classmate who has con-
tracted AIDS.

”If I learned that a friend had
AIDS, I would not be prejudiced
in any way  I don't think I
would treat him any different. I
think that if you did treat him

‘differently, that would be the

same as outcasting him,” said Jeff
Davis, a junior majoring in com-
puter science.

"I'd want to know how they
got it. If it was due to him being
homosexual, I honestly can't say
I would be there in his time of
need. I know this sounds harsh,

but it's true, and these are my‘

views. I'm a very prejudiced per-
son when it comes to certain
things,” said Mike Magri, a fresh-
man business major. .

According to Rob Collins, a
grad student attending the Pitts-
burgh Institute of Mortuary who
has dealt with cases of AIDS, "I'd
ask him how he got it. If he got
it because he was gay, I wouldn't
associate with him. Like up at
school, I won't touch an AIDS
body.” His friend and fellow
classmate, Diane Calabres, dis-
agreed.

’'I would not quit talking to
him. I'd be kind of leery to be
around him, but I wouldn't quit
associating with him. I certainly
wouldn't eat or drink after him,”
said Calabres.

Susanne Simmons, a grad stu-
dent in GSPIA, said knowing

someone with AIDS wouldn't‘

bother her. ’

"I have a friend who has AIDS.
I felt for him. I've a lot of gay
friends and have no prejudice
toward sexual orientation. He's
really a great guy. All I would
want to do is hug them and be
there for them,” said Simmons.

Added Simmons, ”The key is
education. You're playing with
lives, and people should be in-
formed. If you're smart you'll
practice safe sex. I think it's im-
portant that people get tested. It's
the only way to contain the
disease."

major said he would definitely
support the institution of such a
policy. "It surprises me, however,
that there actually may be cases
of sexual orientation discrimina-
tion,” he said. '

Benton also said if more and
more groups fight for such poli-
cies, "I don't think it's going to
stop."

Stock market cautious

By John C. Given
AP Business Writer

. NEW YORK — Like a patient
who left the hospital too soon,
the stock market finds itself in a
precarious state, starting the week
deeply shaken by a major plunge
eerily reminiscent of one that
preceded Black Monday.

The Dow Jones industrial aver-
age closed out last week with its
third-biggest loss ever, 140.58
points, or 6.9 percent of its value.
That left the closely watched in-
dicator at 1,911.31. A

More than $144.7*"‘billion in
stock value was wiped out, or
about 5.67 percent of the Wil-
shire Associates index of 5,000
stocks. On the New York Stock
Exchange, more than seven
stocks fell in price for every one
that rose.

The debacle, which easily ob-
literated 113 points of gains over
the previous four sessions, threw
bathtubs of ice water on hopes,
in some quarters, that the market
was finally pulling itself together
after the horrors of Oct. 19.

Market-watchers noted uncom-

fortably that Black Monday's
crash of 508 points had been
preceded by another Friday ses-
sion that saw a huge decline:
108.35 points on Oct. 16, the
fourth-biggest loss ever.

Friday's plunge was kicked off
with a Labor Department report
that civilian unemployment
dropped to 5.8 percent in De-
cember, its lowest rate since July

1979, raising fears of higher in- '

terest rates and inflation.

Some analysts said traders also
were disturbed by advance
reports on recommendations by
a presidential study commission
on the Black Monday crash,
reports that in some respects
turned out to be false.

The advance reports indicated
that the commission wanted stric-
ter controls over trading on all
U.S. markets and provisions for
price limits or trading halts. it
turned out that the commission
report, issued after the market
closed, did not ask for price

Finding trashy evidence  

By Linda Deutsch

Associated Press Writer

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. —
One of the mundane rituals of
American life —- taking out the
garbage — comes under scrutiny
by the Supreme Court, which will
hear arguments Monday on
whether police can search trash
for evidence of crime.

Attorneys for the defendants in
People vs. Greenwood, an
Orange County drug case which
seemed routine at the outset, say
the high court's decision will
send a message to government
on how far they may intrude into
the private lives of citizens.

”There is a basic expectation of
privacy when someone puts the
trash out expecting it to be picked
up and dumped at the dump,”
said defense attorney Michael Ian
Gary. ”They don’t expect that
anyone will pick through it, and
that is a reasonable expectation.”

But Orange County Deputy
District Attorney Michael Pear,
who, along with Gary, will argue
the case against Billy Greenwood
before the U.S. Supreme Court,
sees the issue differently.

”Once an individual places
trash out for collection in an area
accessible to the public, they
have given up any reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy in that

berg,

trash,” Pear said. He classifies it
as ”abandoned property,” and
most federal circuit courts that
have confronted the issue agree.

Attorney Richard Schwartz-
who represents co-
defendant Dyanne Van Houton
in the Greenwood case, said the
Supreme Court decision will de-
termine whether government
spies can rummage through the
public’s garbage.

’’If the court adopts what the
district attorney argues, it will be
open season for police to search
trash without cause,” Schwartz-
berg said. ”And your trash is a
microcosm of your life.”

Discarded letters, prescription
drugs and business documents

are private property protected

from intrusion, he argued.

Greenwood of Laguna Beach
and a visitor at his home, Miss
Van Houton, were arrested in the
spring of 1984 and charged with
possession of drugs for sale. It
turned out that police, acting on
an anonymous phone tip, had
been searching Greenwood’s gar-
bage for evidence to support a
search warrant.

”There is no U.S. Supreme
Court case on this issue,” Pear
said. ”The ruling would be a
precedent for the country.”

His wife talks too much about past boyfriends

Q: My wife was pretty loose
before we married and is known
to have gone the whole way with
a number of guys in town. I knew
this before we got married, and
I made up my mind to let the past
be forgotten. It all happened be-
fore we got together.

But my wife won’t let it be that
way. We keep bumping into the
same people in this little place,
and she keeps pointing out this
one and that one as somebody
she sacked out with. I have a de-
cent job here, but that is all that
keeps me in this town. I have
been thinking of finding work
somewhere else where she won ’t
have all these reminiscence-
starters. Do you think I should
take her to another town or stay
here and split from her?

A: I think stay and separate
from her, if that is the choice.
Staying offers more since you do
have a job in the town where you
are now, and that is nothing to
sneeze at. If you try to take her
to another town, she will not
leave behind her way of talking

to you about things you don’t
want to hear. You are right to
want to put the past behind you
-— not to try to forget she ever
slept around, because you won't
forget, but it usually happens that
a mentally well person can put
the past into perspective.

This can't be done if your com-
panion just won't leave it in per-
spective but entertains you with
details of her sex with other men.
If you go to another town with
her, maybe she won't point out
some man on the street saying,
”That guy used to have sex with
me. I could tell you a lot about
him that most people don’t
know. He had a way of...” And
so on. Instead of that, she will be
saying, ”See that guy at the bus
stop? He looks just like a guy
back in Oomph who used to
have sex with me. I could tell you
a lot about him.”

But I don’t want to accept your
choices as the only possible ones.
Maybe you can stay in Oomph
and stay with her, if you explain
to her that few men like to hear

ases,” by Milton Lodge, professor

about their wives’ past sex lives,
and you are not one of that few.
Tell her you can be sensible and
grown-up about her past, but hav-
ing it told and retold only poisons
the present. She may see your
point and promise to drop the
subject. Even having her concede
that talking about her past
bedroom experience‘ is wrong
will be some comfort to you,
even if she can't always keep her
promise to lay off the subject.
And if you don’t want to keep
her, getting that agreement could
be a start in the right direction.

I would like to know why she
does this reminiscing with you. Is

she urging you to improve your
performance as a lover? Because
that is the wrong way. The right
way is to learn to talk about sex
with you, and to learn more
about sex with you, and to dis-
cuss what she wants out of it and

what you want, and learn ways «

to please both of you more as
your life together progresses. If

that is what she wants, there is .

hope for your marriage and your
contentment. .

On the other hand, if she does
it to goad you, thenthe problem
is not sexual but has roots in
some other resentment or discon-
tent that she feels,

MATTHEW
THORNTON.

Oh, boy. Here we go again. I
haven't even had a chance to
take down all my mistletoe, and
the new term’s come knockin’ at

' the door.

I hope everyone has had a
good time standing in lines at the
bookstore and at Thackeray. Sort
of makes you feel like a real stu-
dent, doesn't it? _

We've started a new year, in
case some of you have been
sleeping, and it promises to shape
up into a real interesting one.
We've got the presidential elec-
tions with all their attendant glit-
ter, we've got the governor of

A Arizona headed for the pokey,
we've got the Soviets promising
to move out of Afghanistan and,
with any luck at all, we'll have a
new Tiffany album. At least
there'll be one good laugh.

At last, Ronald Reagan is real-
ly on his way out of the White
House. I don't know about you,
but I've been having my own lit-
tle countdown since the middle
of last year. We have the chance
to pick a brand, spanking new
president, and the list of possibil-
itiesis exceptionally long.

For the start of the new year,
then, let's have a look at the men
who would rule the nation trust-
ing in God, just like it says on the

 

money.

Gary Hart: It seems appropri-
ate to do Gary first. Issues not-
withstanding, which is certainly
no break from tradition, Hart has
the most interesting‘ story to tell
about his campaign. -I don't know
why, but I get the feeling that the
whole thing was orchestrated by
one of the networks, so they
could make a miniseries based
on the whole thing.

Picture it — A man wants to be
president. He also wants to be a
normal nine-to-five guy. The me-
dia picks on him, the other can-
didates call him names. Against
all odds, he battles his way back
to the foreground of American
politics and becomes the front-
runner for his party. He bends the
rules, he makes up his own. Ol-
liemania is back in living color.

The shame of the whole thing,
though, is that the guy has some
really good ideas for how to get
this country out of some of the
messes we're in that are sure to
get lost in the shuffle of scripts._

Pat Robertson: Here's a man
with a mission. God told him to
be president, and now, he plans
to lead the people of this deca-
dent country to their just reward
in Armageddon, Communists
and pacifists be damned.

Bob Dole: Here's the first in the
line of invisible Republicans. For
some reason, they just can't seem
to get themselves into the news.

I get the feeling that Dole has

something up his well-tailored
sleeve, something grand. Maybe
a Dole-and-Dole ticket, maybe a
goodwill trip to Nicaragua. We'll
have to wait and see.

George Bush: Hmm  George
who? Bush, did you say? '

Dick Gephardt: Gephardt has
something of a sad story to tell.
Back at the beginning of the cam-
paign, he was one of the front-
runners. Then he made a mistake
— he kept his nose clean. When
everyone was out grabbing the

public's attention, Gephardt was
in the background wishing all the
candidates with problems the
very best of luck. Nice guys al-
ways finish last.

Paul Simon: It may be'me, but
I just can't take this man serious-
ly. He reminds me of the kid in
high school who was always
whining about everyone picking
on him. Simon does a bit ofthat
himself, most recently about Gary
Hart. He should lose the bow tie
as well. 1

Mike Dukakis: Dukakis was
another one who got a bum deal
along the way. One of his cam-
paign managers showed a tape of
Joe Biden forging his poetic
license, and everybody called
him a spoilsport, even if it was
true. Because it took him nearly

six hours to decide to fire his a

campaign manager, he got a
reputation for being indecisive.
Another candidacy lost to elusive

Did you feel anything different
this year? Did the new numbers,
1988, flow out of your pen more
easily than usual? No crossed out
'87s on your checks? No Wite-
out on your letterheads?

January is barely in the single
digits, the year is in its swaddling
clothes, but it seems as if it's been
1988‘ for months. ‘Chalk it up to
the endless campaign if you will.
The 1988 campaign that began in
1987 and slid over the year's end
without missing an arithmetic
step.

It's left me with the feeling that
we didn't really get a new year
this time. We got a used year, a
hand-me-down year, a leftover
year, a mop-up year. Even the sto-

All we are

 

MARC
DIICIIIN

A course is being offered this
term by Pitt's Honors College as
part of a new program proposal
that involves something that is
often overlooked by many Pitt
students - world peace.

The proposal is a World Peace
Certificate, suggested by Pitt's
Faculty for Social Responsibility
which lists 110 courses, spon-
sored by 19 departments, which
relate to world peace.

Pitt's reputation is not one of a
controversial, liberally minded
student body. Rather, it seems
geared to offer a well-rounded,
four—year education applicable to
the current job market. The lack
of student participation in such
organizations as Students For A-
Free South Africa and Amnesty
International reflect the present
student attitude of fulfilling the
course requirements, graduating
and finding a job. College no
longer seems to be a place to
voice political opinion. The
majority of graduating Pitt stu-
dents directly enter the job
market.

ries that slid along with me over
this annual dividing line offer
fewer hints of a fresh start than of

’ a last chance.

One of my favorites is the tale
of the $149 million jet, the
highest tech plane designed to be

‘ an impregnable presidential com-

mand post in case of nuclear war.
On Dec. 24, it was forced to land
because’ some migrating snow
geese were sucked into the
engines.

Another is the memory of the
floating garbage heap, the scow
without_a country, that carried
the refuse of Long Island from
one port to another looking for a
dump.

And the third is that dubious

Achievement Award won by 1
‘Donald Hodel, secretary of the

interior, for his private sector in-
itiative to combat trouble in the
ozone. His solution is ’’personal
protection” against ultraviolet
radiation: hats, sunglasses, sun-
screen ointments, the works.

These three form a trilogy of
confrontations with reality. In ev-
ery case, reality lost. ‘Were they
the harbingers of a used 1988?_

In this quiet transition time, it
isn't just 40-year-old American
women who are bumping up
against the biological clock. We

all are. Our high-tech hardware
can't coexist with migrating
geese. In our passion to waste,
we no longer have an away to
throw things. _And when we blow
a hole in the ozone, all we can
manage to prescribe is suntan
lotion.

These are not the only exam-
ples of the bad old days that we
carry with us into the not—so—new

year. There are others, far more

familiar.

There is financial proof of our
difficulty in living within eco-

nomic limits: 5 $148 billion’

budget deficit that looms over the
future like last month's Christmas

bills. There is foreign proof of our‘

difficulty living within political
limits: the bills that come from
our belief that America must be
everywhere, making its power
and presence felt.

We are having trouble just
thinking about a world in which
we are no longer No. 1. We're
having trouble learning to live
within this world, rather than rul-
ing it.

As for the campaigns that origi-
nally blurred the line of passage
from one year to the next? In po-

litics, 1984 was morning in 1

America. Now, 1988, we are
told, is the morning after.

Campaigns are always about
the future. This time, polls sug-
gest that the voters are worried
and w-illing to deal ° with
problems. Candidates announce
regularly that they have ”new
ideas” for ”hard choices?’ we
must face.

But the two don't seem to con-
nect. It’s'as if there is some gap
in language or hearing.

I'm not at all sure how recep-
tive people would really be to the
politics of national restraint and
diminished expectations. If we
were uncomfortable with Jimmy
Carter's message of malaise, how
likely are we to rally against
realism?

Nor do I believe that a candi-
date can run on the prospect of

keeping America tied for first

place. It's hard to raise goose
bumps with a promise that we'll
only be competitive, when peo-
ple wantto cheer winning.

The one new trick would be for
a candidate to fuse a message of
American optimism and grit. Op-
timism that doesn’t sound like a
fairy tale, and grit that doesn't
sound like drudgery. But for the
moment, all we hear are the
sounds of a very old new year.

Ellen Goodman is a nationally
syndicated columnist from the
Boston Globe.

saying, is give peace a chance  

The university has responded
to this desire by creating pro-
grams such as Job Search and job
fairs to give students opportuni-
ties to investigate various career
choices.

It works. The university keeps
itself in business by providing a
nationally accepted curriculum in
which students can simply enroll
to attain the neccessary qualifica-
tions to land a good job.
However, how valuable and
practical is our undergraduate
education? _ .

Our college education trains us
to think and analyze clearly and
logically. Yet, we gain the nec-
cessary career training by being
”on the job.” Rarely do we have
a chance as educated adults to
exercise the specific knowledge
we gain in our classes. But in real-
ity, who cares if we know Kant's
philosophy or Shakespeare's
works. In America, we just have
to do our job to survive. So, as we
concentrate on making money
and getting promoted, we even-
tually forget our classrooms.

Our responsibility as educated
adults does not stop with con-
tributing to free enterprise. We
are responsible for the function-
ingof the society in which we
live. It is the responsibility of our
colleges and universities to teach
us this obligation.

Luckily, the Faculty for Social
Responsibility has realized and
acted on this. Offering the typi-
cal higher education common to
most universities for over
hundreds of years is not enough.
It is crucial for universities to
recognize a changing society and
teach its students accordingly. It
is this teaching which can be

remembered and utilized by a
modern‘ society.

The recent Washington summit
of President Reagan and Gener-
al Secretary Gorbachev stresses
the importance of the World
Peace Certificate. The summit
was a breakthrough step in
peaceful relations. Without
proper knowledge of the many
factors influencing such an event,
it's significance could be wasted.

To function, we must learn to
adapt quickly and respond cor-
rectly to our society. The issue of
peace has always been impor-
tant, However, peace fluctuates
according to the society. As stu-
dents, it is crucial for us to know
our current society and how
peace fits in. Such knowledge
can not be fully obtained from a
newspaper, a magazine or even
Dan Rather.

Ultimately, we use our educa-
tion to choose our political be-
liefs, morals and goals. The fact
that we are students is not a legiti-
mate excuse to detach ourselves
from society. A university com-
munity resembles a glass bubble
which protects our structured
lives of lectures and library times.
It is easy to bury our noses in our
books and dedicate our thoughts
to what we choose, but sooner or

later, we will have to face deci-
sions relating to the real world.
The certificate course offered

this term — Rethinking Securities .

in the Nuclear Age — is an op-

portunity for students to under-

stand and judge the actions of
political leaders. It is a small part
of the overall peace picture
which must be available for stu-
dents to study.

Students at Tufts University and
Moscow State University will
have the opportunity to partici-
pate in a joint course between the
two universities which endorse a
”worldwide curriculum for
peace.”

The course represents a grow-
ing need to educate future lead-
ers on current peace issues.

At Pitt, the World Peace Certifi-
cate must be given proper con-
sideration. In addition to careful
selection of course requirements,
new courses relevant to present
peace issues should be de-
veloped. ‘

It is the responsibility of the
dean to approve the World Peace
Certificate. However, it's the job
of the students to take advantage
of such a program. '

Freshman Darelle Porter brings the ball upcourt as Redmen guard Michael Porter defends.

Gore taking steps to
become total player

Demetreus Gore played 33
minutes in Pitt's 81-70 win over
St. John's at Fitzgerald Field
House Saturday night, and Core,
of all people, was a little sur-
prised.

”That may be the most I've
played since [Pitt] coach [Paul]
Evans has been here,” Gore said
after the game.

JOHN
ENRIGI-I'l'

 

Gore had his third most
productive output of the season
and only his fifth double-digit
\game of the year, scoring 18

. points in Pitt's first win over the

Redmen in four years.

Ironically, Gore's scoring out-
put was a direct result of his
defense and rebounding —- those
intangibles many players never
master.

They're also intangibles which
are requirements if you want to
play for Evans.

For much of the early part of
this season, it seemed Gore
would never master those boring
facets of the game either. Boring
to Gore because he's a scorer by
trade, and everyone knows it.

Bothered by a lingering ankle
injury and Evans’ seemingly ac-

curate criticism that he doesn't
know anything about defense,
Gore felt his senior season wasn't
exactly going the way he wanted.

Nineteen minutes and nine

points a game can be pretty I.

depressing after 29 minutes and

16 points a game two years ago

as a sophomore. _
Gore said his low point cam

after Pitt's win over Florida on na—.

tional television Jan. 2. It was a
game in which Gore didn't have
much time to score his whopping
total of two points. Eight minutes,
to be exact.

"After the Florida game, I had
a lot of soul searching to do. I felt
bad. I had to ask myself if I was
dedicated to get back in shape or
if was I going to blame other peo-
ple olr Coach Evans. I think it was
a matter of me coming out and
playing hard. Coach wants to win
as much as anyone else, and
when I play hard, I play good,
and coach won't take me out of
the game.” I

Smith, Lane lead
Pittover St. ]ohn’s;

face Dukes tonight

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

If it's not one jinx, it's another.

Last Wednesday night, the Pan-
thers lost their sixth straight game
to Georgetown in the Capital
Centre and had to face the
prospect of playing St. John's, a
team which has beaten Pitt the
last seven times the teams have
played. In the last four of those
losses, the Panthers lost by a
combined seven points.

It would seem strange, but
seniors Charles Smith and De-
metreus Gore have never beaten
the Redmen since they've been
playing for Pitt. Smith and Gore
were unsuccessful in six of the
seven-game skid.

But Saturday night, the Pan-
thers (ranked second by The As-
sociated Press) snapped the
Redman’s curse, 81-70, before a
sellout crowd of 6,798 at Fitzger-
ald Field House.

The Panthers record is 10-1
(1-1 in the Big East) while St.
John's fell to 8-3 (0-2 in the
league). —

”We feel pretty good about it.
I don't think we thought about it
too much,” said Smith, referring
to the seniors helping to stop the
losing streak. ~”lt was just another
game we had to win.

”It’s not too much of an incen-
tive, going intoany game, but
there is the fact that we have to
win every game to do well. All

  
 

those personal goals and every-
thing will fit right in if we win ball
games.”

”For [Charles and I], there was
a little added incentive, but over-
all for the team, we just wanted
to bounce back. Charles and I
told each other that we've got to
[beat St. John's] now,” said Gore.

That's exactly what the Pan-
thers did, running out to a 12-0’
lead in the first 2:43 of the game
andnever looking back. The Red-
men would only get as close as
nine points the rest of the way.

One of St. John's downfalls was
their first half shooting. They hit
only 11 of 32 shots, a 34.4 per-
cent clip.

7 ”The kids needed to have [the
early lead], to have the confi-
dence. They needed that after the
loss to Georgetown,” said Pan-
ther coach Paul Evans. ”It loo-
sened everything up for the
whole group.

”They played pretty well. The
intensity was good at the begin-
ning,” he added.

The Panthers led at halftime,
40-23.

The second half saw Pitt run its
lead to 20 points, 64-44 with
9:20 remaining and 166-46-with
8:23 left. But the Redmen cut the
lead to 12, 70-58,.at the 5:53

mark. St. John's cut the lead to

nine, 79-70, with :21 left, but

son Williarﬁs was called for

Despite the loss, Belowich was
pleased with the team's effort.

"There's a lot of pressure on
everyone here at Pitt. Everyone
did well on grades last term and
still made practices over finals,”
said Belowich.

Belowich was also happy with
the way his team trained over the
break in Puerto Rico. "It was a
very good situation all the way
around,” said Belowich. "It sets

      

up the rest of the season for us."

Belowich feels that the loss to_

Penn State could have easilyhave
gone the other way. "Right after
the meet, I talked to the Penn
State coach, and we both agreed
that if we swam the meet again,
the outcome could have been
different,” he said. "They simply
had a little more power in the
matchups."

The freshmen continued to turn
in good performances. Celeste
Makiel won the 200-. and

500—yard freestyle. "Celeste had _

as good a meet as she's had at Pitt

so far," said Belowich.

Freshmen Theresa Picklo and
Liz Sari took first and second in
the 1,000-yard freestyle. "It’s nice
to look fon/vard to having those
girls around for a while,” said Be-
lowich.

Senior Judy Haughton placed
second in the 100- and 200-yard
butterfly behind Penn State's All-

’The divers also continued to be
a strong part of the team. Tricia

Margie Paul ick took second, and
Candace Yackmack took third.

"Tricia is throwing dives she's

She's probably the best diver in

shots in the game.

Sure, only seven went in, but
the fans seemed to enjoy each at-
tempt Gore took more than the
previous one. .

"My shots weren't really fall-
ing, but I thought I played pretty
hard, so Coach Evans played
me," Gore said.

"I think I'm the kind of player
that if I stay in the game, I'm go-
ing to get my baskets. Like tonight
[Saturday night]. ‘I, shot terrible,
but I got a lot ofeasy b'a“‘skéts.”

Evans attributed Gore's in-
creased playing time to one of the
chores that has earned him a seat
on the bench in the past. Re-

. bounding.

"Demetreus played pretty well.
Not so much offensively, but he
did some good things off the
boards. He kept Matty Brust [St.
John's 220-pound forward] off the
boards. And I think Brust is a
gorilla.”

Gore finished the game with
nine rebounds. It wasn't a career
high but was much better than

‘ _ the 2.1 boards he was averaging.

Rebounding has never been
one of Gore's strengths. Of
course, it's hard to compete on
the boards at the small forward
position when you're 6-foot—5,
and everyone else is two or three
inches taller.

"All the coaches stayed on me
about blocking out. I'm concen-
trating more [on rebounding]
than I have in the past. I'm not
used to blocking out 6-7 guys. I
just have to keep the right frame
of mind,” Gore said.

.With Pitt's loss of Rod Brookin
to academic amnesia, Pitt needs
Gore's services. And Gore thinks
he finally has acclimated himself
to the style of play Evans
demands.

"What Coach Evans was trying
to do [by benching me] was get
it in my headlthatl had to do a
lot of little things or I wasn't go-
ing to play," Gore said.

Gore now knows if he re-
bounds and plays hard on
defense, he'll get a chance to do
more of what really got him this
far. ‘

''All my career I've been a
scorer. I feel that now I better get
my ankle together and get in
there and do what I've always
done in my career."

Score, of course.

  A     Lady Panthers’ losing
streak reaches four  

 

ti:

Lady Panther junior Deidra Baker scored ‘14__points_ in a losing cause against Syracuse.

Wrestlers
prepare for
Franklin-
Marshall

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
will try to get its 1988 campaign
off to a good start when they face
Franklin and Marshall-at Fitzger-
ald Field House tomorrow night.
at 7:30.

Pitt is 1-0 in dual meets this
year, having shut out Waynes-
burg earlier in the season, and
has had a good showing in a
number of preseason tour-
naments.

”This should be a good way to
open our rapid-fi re dual meet sea-
son,” said head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. ”Their best weights
last year were at 150 and 158, so
we’ll be looking forward to lock-
ing horns with them there, yet I
don't think that they are as strong
as in previous years, but they
have a great tradition. There is no
way that we can take them
lightly.”

Stottlemyer is not completely
sure what his lineup will look
like, but All-America Pat Santoro
is probably a sure bet at 142.

Over the Christmas break, San-
toro continued his dominance by
pulling off a first place in the Mid-
lands tournament. He is still un-
defeated this season.

”Pat was able to win, but he
didn't look as good as he has
earlier this year,” said Stott-
lemyer. ”We are starting our sec-
ond training schedule, so nobody
is up to par yet. The whole team
is at the bottom of the ladder,
working their way up.”

Pitt only sent five wrestlers to
the tournament but was still able

Despite the solid play of sopho-
more forward Lorri Johnson and
senior forward Sally Sheerer, the
Pitt Lady Panthers basketball
team is in the midst of a four-
game losing streak, their latest
loss an 84-68 reversal at the
hands of the Syracuse Orange-
women, Saturday afternoon at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Sheerer scored 20 points, in-
cluding 15 on five three-point

‘field goals, and Johnson added

18 points. But the Lady Panthers
were outdone by Orangewoman
guard Simone Courtlandt, who
scored 29 points, 23 of which
came in the second half.

Three other Syracuse players
scored in double figures. Tonya
Hendrix had 15 points, Davita
Smith added 14, and All-Big East

guard Sue Ludwig added 12 for
the Orangewomen.

Pitt is 0-3 in Big East play and
6-6 overall.

Syracuse is 10-3 overall and
3-1 in the Big East.

Sheerer and Johnson have been
bright spots on what has other-
wise been an inconsistent Pan-
ther squad. Sheerer was
averaging a team high 12.7 points
and 7.1 rebounds before the Syra-
cuse game, and Johnson was
averaging 17.5 points and 7.5 re-
bounds in two Big East games.

Although four players padded
their averages in Saturday's
game, others lost ground. Junior
point guard Denise Becher, aver-
aging nearly six points a game,
had only three in the loss, all
coming on one three-point shot.

And starting off-guard Jennifer
Shingler, who was included in

Broncos, Redskinswin to keep hopes alive

By John Mossman
AP Sports Writer

DENVER —— John Elway, deftly’

finding single coverage in the
Houston defense, threw two
touchdown passes to tight end
Clarence Kay, and the Denver
Broncos capitalized on Houston
mistakes and penalties for a
34-10 divisional playoff victory
Sunday..

With the victory, Denver set up
a rematch of‘ last year's AFC
championship game with

Cleveland. The teams will play
next Sunday at Mile High Stadi-
um. The Browns defeated indi-
anapolis 38-21 on Saturday.
Two costly interceptions and a
critical first-quarter fumble on a
lateral by running back Mike
Rozier doomed the Oilers, who
were making their first playoff ap-

I ‘pearance since 1980.

Rozier’s fumble occurred at the
Houston 1 after Bronco punter
Mike Horan had punted out of
bounds at the 5. Denver got a
quick score on Gene Lang's run,

and Elway's TD passes of 27 and
1 yard to Kay helped lift Denver
to a commanding 24-3 halftime
lead.

In the first three quarters,
Houston had three legitimate
scoring opportunities but convert-
ed only once, on Tony Zendejas'
46-yard, second-quarter field
goal.

The others ended on lineback-
er Karl Meck|enburg’s intercep-
tion at the Denver 10 and on
cornerback Mark Haynes’ theft
and 57-yard return from the end

Art and reason
_ When Mark and I decided to spend
the weekend at his mother’s house,
I never imagined I would be walking
into a mouse’s nightmare. There were

cats everywhere.

\\“

Cat plaques, cat statues, cat clocks,
even a cat mat. I couldn’t begin to dupli-
cate her collection of kitty litter ifl spent
a year at a garage sale. Conspicuously
absent, however, was a real cat. Strange
I thought, and began to fear that a

weekend with cat woman could be a
I lot less than purr-feet.
But then she came home, and
Mark introduced her. She was
dressed surprisingly well——no
leopard pants. In fact, you
could say she was the cat’s meow,
but I’d rather not.
She offered me a cup of Dutch Choc-
olate Mint. Now that was something
I could relate to. Then she brought it
 out in the most beautiful, distinctly
unfeline china I’d ever seen. As we
sipped, I found out that Mrs. Campbell
has my same weakness for chocolate,’
loves the theater as much as I do, but,
incredibly, never saw “Cats?” So Mark
and I are taking her next month.

Chicago Bears 21-17 Sunday to

reach the NFC title game for the ’

second straight year.

With Walter Payton, playing in
his final NFL game, reverting to
the form that has made him the
league's career rushing leader
and the defense looking like the
one that led the Bears to a Super
Bowl victory two years ago,
Chicago took a 14-0 lead in the
first 22 minutes in the 4-degree
temperature and minus-21 wind
chill factor.

Calvin Thomas ran two yards
for one touchdown, and Jim
McMahon, playing his first game
in the last month after suffering a
pulled hamstring, threw 14 yards
to Ron Morris for the other, as
Payton ran for 62 yards in 10 car-
ries on the second drive.

Then, Washington's defense
took over, registering five sacks,
three by Charles Mann, and three
interceptions, while limiting Pay-
ton to 23 more yards on eight car-
ries for the rest of the game.

And Doug Williams, who won
the quarterback job from Jay
Schroeder, suddenly brought the
Redskins back, hitting Ricky
Sanders for 32 yards on a drive
capped by George Rogers’ 3-yard
touchdown run. Then he hit Clint
Didier with an 18-yard touch-
down pass in the final minute that
tied it 14-14 at halftime.

Women-

Continued from page 13
the league's Top 20 individual
scorers with a 10.5 average,
scored only two points, both on,
free throws.

On the other hand, the Lady
Panthers placed four players in
double figures. Five-foot-11
center Tabatha Long contributed
11 points, nearly four over her
average, and junior forward
Deidra Baker contributed 14, six
points over her season average.

Sheerer and Johnson also bet-
tered their averages with their
performances. .

The Lady Panthers next gam
will be against the Connecticut
Huskies Wednesday night at 5:1 5
p.m. at Fitzgerald Field House.

LADY PANTHER NOTES:
Sheerer went four-for—five from
three—point range in the first half
for an .800 average. She now has
11 three-point point field goals
on the season  Sheerer is now
ninth on the all-time Pitt scoring
list with 754 points  Johnson
has scored in double figures‘ in

- the past eight games and is aver-

aging nearly 18 points in Pitt's
three Big East games.

Wrestling-

to finish 11th overall. Penn State
finished eighth with the same
number of wrestlers.

Tomorrow night's meet starts a
string for the Panthers in which
they face off against three tough
opponents in. less than a week.
Thursday night, Morgan State
comes into the Field House, fol-
lowed by Lehigh University next
Monday.

”Our dual season starts to roll
now,” said Stottlemyer. ”Right
now, we are holding our elimina-
tions to set our starting lineup.
We have a strong team this year,
so I am confident that we will be
able to send a good bunch out
there. It should be interesting.”

"said St. John's Coach Lou Car-

nesecca. ”You’ve got to give Pitt
a lot of credit for playing good
defense, especially Smith and
Lane. They're very good players.”

Smith led all scorers with 20
points despite playing only 27
minutes. Jerome Lane and Gore
added 19 and 18 points, respec-
tively. Lane led all rebounders
with 15.

Shelton Jones led St. John's

with 16 points while Williams
had 13, and guard Michael Port-
er chipped in with 11.

Tonight, the Panthers play Du-
quesne at the Field House. This
so-called rivalry has just turned
into another game on the roster
for Pitt.

For some of the Pitt players, the
Duquesne game may be a game
just to pad their statistics. ”That’s

said with a smile.

’’I understand it's a rivalry, but
I don't want to play them. It's on

out and play as hard as we can,”
said Lane. ”Duquesne has good
talent, but I don't think we should
play them.”

”We have the opportunity,
again, to get on another roll,”
said Smith. ”We’ve got Du-
