[Five -Students
Attempt 1 Rescue  

Five Pitt students attempted to
rescue‘ a woman, Catherine Evans,
who jumped from the 22nd Street
‘Bridge’ to’ end. her own life, last
Tuesday morning, ' A ‘ _

" The ‘ﬁve students, -Carl Anderson,
Volney. Patton; . Robert Daley
Charles’Vates, and Dick Fairlwere
driving to an 8130 class" at Med
‘school and were delayed by a’ traffic
jam at _tli_e_bridge.- Seeing a crowd
"gathered, they got-out of the car
to investigate. When they .d-iscov-'
ered that a woman had jumped into
the water and was still afloat,‘they
went to the rescue. '

Anderson, Patton, and -Daley,
dove_ into the wateyand towed her
in while Fair and Vat-es drove to
the nearest Coast ‘Guard Station
for aid. ‘ ‘

~The three-5-escuers -managed to
. get the woman as far as the retain-
ing wall which is about 20 feet
high. They could not get her on to

the. top. of .t_he wall, ho_wever,. so

had to hold her about 3 feet" out of
the water until the Coast Guard
cutter. arrived, too late to save her
life.

Dear Editor:

.’  a Pitt home game. _ ‘

{played at South Bend instead

_ I Editor’s Note: The complaint expressed in this letter is typical
h’ of many I have received this week. It was selected because it is typical.
‘To Ned and other interested Pittites, I can oﬁer this comfort. The
I/administration is trying to organize a Pitt band. The cheerleaders,
who were all inexperienced, are anxious to promote Pitt enthusiasm.
ylnd ESGC is trying to solve all the other problems. Announcement
',i'r[f3'their progress will be made in the next issue. So if your conﬁdence
l”'z"n'l the student spirit is well—founded, we will really "back our team”
 the next home game. And] am sure your conﬁdence is cor_rect.

 I believe we Pitt students have been accused from sev-
eral sides of not having had much school spirit at the Pitt-
‘Notre Dame football game Saturday. The people who listened
.to"the game broadcast said they heard no Pitt cheers or songs.

_ ‘king on Saturday, but the setting which _the Pitt stiidents
-reund themselves in, thatmade cheering rather hard to do.

Pitt students found no band present to lead them in the
-‘football game favorites, “Hail To Pitt,” “The Pitt Victory
I ng,” and .“The Chant.” Even the “Alma Mater” was omitted
Saturday, and when a group of loyal Pitt rooters in the ﬁrst
rows of the student section tried to start the “Alma Mater,”
their noble efforts were lost in the strains of the “Notre Dame
‘Victory March” played by the Central Catholic Band, seated
,d_ijrectly in front of them. I am wondering when was the last
, 1rne‘before Saturday that the “Alma Mater” was not played

 . Many thought that the soldiers
itt, especially when they had been ‘given mimeographed
heets with the words of Pitt songs and cheers to learn.’ How-
v.'e_r,' these many forgot that a great number of the soldiers
{Pitt are from the Midwest, and naturally would favor
.otre Dame. Saturday afternoon was their free time, and they
cou-ld—cheer for whomever they chose. ‘

yn;u’ch7more support from thgpeople in the stands if they had

fcidedly a Notre Dame crowd, and the Pitt ‘-rooters almost felt
li-he strangers in their own school’s stadium. Then the Central
atholic band, representing Notre Dame, did not encourage
,_1tt cheers by being situated in front of the cheering block,
between the students and the ‘cheerleaders,’ and enthusiastic-
lilly blaring forth when Notre Dame scored or made a big
aip. It was something of a slap in the face to the Pitt rooters.
 The sports public has a reputation for being ﬁckle, and
this probably explains the heavy support for Notre Dame.‘ But
tofjaccuse the Pitt students of not having had school spirit is.
an-‘oinjustice. Give us_half a chance and we’ll prove that we’re
.th7ere’suppo1‘ting our team, winvor lose. .

 etters Praise Pitt .

War Conditions
Lirnit Frat Plans  

“Fraternity as Usual” will be a
far cry "from the situation which
will actually exist on campus this
fall. Not_ since the first world war
has any -Pitt fraternity been’ forced
to close its doors, but now, due to
the absence of fraters and the lack
of incoming pledges, some of .the
‘fGr‘eeks”v have had to shut down
for the duration. H l .

Phi Delta Theta, H Delta Tau
Delta, Sigma‘ Alpha (Epsilon, Phi
Gamma Delta, and Pi Lamba Phi
are the only houses on campus
open. They will continue their
usual activities on as" war time
basis. _

‘Phi Epsilon Pi has moved from’
its house. but the Phi Eps are still
holding regular meetings and are
planning a regular rushing pro-
gram, as are the Pi Kappa Alphas.

Sigma -Chi, Alpha Phi Delta,

Capt. Ralph Abel, USlVlC, spent

_ a hectic twenty-one months in the

South Paciﬁc area, seeing action in
all centers of activity except Luzon.
Ralph was able to come home while
his ship was undergoing badly need-
ed repairs.

Both Lt. Rudy Janata and Lt.
Harry Radin were home on fur-
lough from Hawaii recently.

Lt. Paul L. Jennings writes from
North Africa, “Last night at the
evening song and prayer service,
the chaplain passed out copies of
Stephen Foster songs for the serv-
ice, published by the University of
Pittsburgh Press. It made me just
a bit homestick but also very proud
of my school, so I took time out to

explain to the boys that we did,

something in Pittsburgh besides
turn out championship athletic
teams.”

1st Lt. Herbert Gall ‘breezed into
schoollast week from Texas and
was able, incidently, to” show his
very shiny, hard-earned Wings.

Former faculty members are well
distributed in the various branches
of the service. Lt. ‘Carroll Amund-
son from the history department is
stationed at Fort Schuyler, New

A York.

Lt. Robert Arthur, director of the
University band last year, is now
at Gross -Ilem, Michigan.

Formerly a professor in the his-
tory department, Lt. Russell Fergu-
son is Executive Oﬂicer at the Navy
School in Bowling Green, Ohio.

Pitt Bond

Everyone’s complaining about the
lack of school spirit at the Notre
Dame game. Here’s a chance for
some Pitt students-to do something
about it. .

Only 43 men have signed up to
play in the Pitt Marching Band.
That is only a little over a third of
the size of last year’s band.

Therefore, recruits are needed.
Anyone who plays a band instru-
ment is urged to join. Applicants
can sign up in the Dean of Men’s
oﬁice on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, Cathedral.

  We are not offering excuses or apologies for the showing
  or rather, the complete lack of one, our Panthers made against

Strangely enough, the team itself has not sought excuses

 seems that to most of the boys, just playing Notre Dame was
 a thrill sufficient unto itself. The consensus of opinion was that

Clark Shaughnessy, whose Pittsburgh coaching ‘debut
, started with something less than a bang, accepted the defeat

 ,;:..-fexperience, it was easy torun up a big score,” he said. He used
_’-I . _, track as an ‘example to illustrate his point. “In track there are

 Uthere is little difference in percentage points, there is .a? big

_ One interesting repercussion came from the. soldiers sta-
tioned at Pitt who witnessed the game. ‘‘._You’d have beaten
them easily if some of us had been in there” was a frequent
(comment. It has_ long been a matter of speculation as to what
the Army would do when the Navy began mopping up the so-
ealled “Army”. schools. ‘Army-Navy rivalry has always been
strong and a desire to save “face” may have moreto do with.
lifting the,Army ban on cadet participation in athletics than

ahything else. , _ V , k ,
 The Pantherslcurrently have a ‘prime example of the
jwei1‘d way in which the Army and Navy rulings work. Guard
- Francis Mattioli and,Backs Frank Knisley and Angelo Car-
laccini are enrolled in the Pitt Dental School. All three have
the same‘ classes, the same_ amount of work, and the same;
{amount of time. But Mattioli and Knisley are in the V-12
Naval Reserve. They can continue" to play football. Carlaccini
Zisin the Army Reserve. And he can’t play.

 ' Generally speaking, there wasn’t ‘anything too funny
-H‘-about the Notre Dame game,_but it did have its moments.
,_ Thus, while the boys ﬁgurtively lost their shirts in the battle,
'1 Mattioli and Ebert quite literallylost their pants. The new
white pants, it seems, held up on a level with the Pitt line, both
coming apart at the more vital seams. Since neither of the
player's could be spared, the changes weremade right on the
ﬁelcl with the managers, holding up a screen of blankets.

, Tomorrow’s game does not ﬁgure to be too much dilferent
from that of last week, aside( from the difference in the spell-
in of the name in the boxscore. However, Panther rooters»
may ﬁnd some comfort in the fact that the Pitt-Great Lakes
(games to date have come under the heading of “upsets.” (An
_ "upset” according to our favorite deﬁnition is any game you
 _don’t pick right). In 1918,, which marked the ﬁrstimeeting
 ‘between the Panthers and the Bluejackets, Pitt was heavily
, "favored. The Panthers took the ball on the opening kickoff
and marched the length of the ﬁeld for a touchdown. The ball
 seldonileft their possession for the first three quarters but in
__}."the ﬁnal quarter Great Lakes pushed across a touchdown to
 win, 10-9.

 Great Lakes was the heavy pre-game favorite last year.
 ‘But the Panthers scored early and held a 6-0 advantage until
the ﬁnal ten minutes of the game when the Bluejackets man-
aged to push across a touchdown to gain a 7-6 win.

:I Perhaps it is well to remember Clark Shaughnessy’s
r~~-promise to his team when the fall practice began. “We shall
..i~:Vnot fail,” he told them, “because of lack of spirit, faith, or
 pi-discipline.”

 

 We have not failed for lack of spirit, faith, or discipline.

It is generally conceded that Pitt.

willhave to wait until next week

before they ﬁnd any silver lining :
to the 1943 football cloud. Things 
were pretty bad against —Notre
Dame last week and they'do not
ﬁgure to‘ be much_ better against 2
Great Lakes this week. For. the ;

 

Panthers are, still playing out o
theirdclass. - ' '

‘As Clark Shaughnessy so aptly
put it, Notre Dame was “too old,
too‘ big, and too experienced for.
us.” ‘Aside from three _plays—a
heroic goal line stand that momen-
tarily delayed touchdown number
six, 3., 22 yard‘ run byCarlaceini
when 33 were needed to make .—a

pass from Mocha to Malarkey, the‘
Panthers could not have been any
more out of the game had _ they
spent the afternoon (in the dressing
room. And this,.is-no reﬂection on
the players. Without exception they
gave it everything theyhad. But it
wasn’t nearly enough. '

Leading the team against Great
Lakes will be Marty Rosepink, who
has been appointed Captain for the
game.‘ Rosepink, who had been play-
ing the tackle spot for only eight
days prior to the N otre Dame game,
turned in an excellent job that drew
praise from his coach. A

There will be no drastic changes’

Lakes contest, for Shaughnessy said
that... he was satisﬁed that “there
wasn’t a boy on the‘ team who didn’t
conscientiously give his best.” Once
again Francis Mattioli and Gary
Feniello will team- up as guards.
Milt Ebert and Captain‘ Marty Rose-
pink will share the tackle spots and
Don Fisher will again start at cen-
ter. Joe Pierreand. Jim Maloney,
both of whom managed to look
goodin spite of everything in the
N otre Dame contest, will'- be the
Panther ends. 1

in Chicago on their way to Minne-

Ohio Company Papers

   

’ .1 The library is today in receipt ofv
— almost 150 letters and documents
A ‘relating to the Ohio Company, first
 .,jla.n(l or real estate company in
,Western Pennsylvania.
A‘ They are the gift of a member
" of "a prominent Pittsburgh family,
which, for generations, has been
interested in the University and
 Pittsbiirgh.
 The papers date from 1739 to
1785. Besides letters are bills of
_ sales, bonds, and other legal pap-
’, ers. One contains an item “to cash
 lent at Fort Pitt.”
The papers are part of the once
,_-consi-dered legendary Ohio Com-
-'*"pany records, the first documents
._ -or which came to the University
 in 1941. These records have twice
,1 '—been /damatically lost-and res-
’ 'cused.' They had been handed down
,5 (from generation to generation of
 ‘descendants of the Ohio Company
'7 i'fo_unders. Before the Civil War they
 were in the possession of the Mer-
5’ cer family at “Howard” in Alexan-
; dria, Virginia. In 1861 Alexandria
gwas taken by the Union Army and
‘.-‘Howard” became a federal hos-
