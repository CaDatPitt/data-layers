One of the petitions currently

being circulated at the Univer---

sity calls for the cancellation of
classes for a t.wo-week period
prior to both the May primary
A elections and the general elect-
tions in the fall. Should the ad-
ministration comply. it/ may find
itself embroiled in a lawsuit

initiated by the Young Ameri-

cans for Freedom (YAF t.

Frank Donatelli. president of
the Western Pennsylvania Coun-
cil of the YAF and former presi-
dent of the University of Pitts-
burgh chapter. informed the
Pitt News that his group would
definitely attempt to serve an
injunction against the Univer-

the pea ceful -

acted as host. Dr. Landy point-
ed out, in a short preface, that

“the deaths were connected to.

the American way of life.”
SYMPTOMS

She defined the major symp-
toms of the crisis facing concern-
ed citizens as the Cambodia de-
ployment, the suppression of
freedom of expression, and the
unwillingness of the President
and Vice President to communi-
cate.

While Dr. Landy and the oth-
er speakers manned to makeshift
podium. a series of petitions
and leaflets circulated the crowd.

tnost of whom were seated on
the grass.
The NIcCovern—Hatfield‘ Am-‘

endment. which proposed ‘cut-
ting funds lor the war: was giv-
en special attention by several
of the speakers. Those present
were urged to sign it.

Craig Kuhn, City Council of-

ficial, followed a poetry reading *
_by Eugenia Mason on thetplat-

form. Kuhn labeled the war a
“legitimate concernof city gov-
ernment” and revealed that a
resolution proposed to the Coun-

"We believe.“ explained Don-
atelli. "that the University is
bound by a contractual obliga-
tion to provide certain services
for its students. Any student pay-

ing tuition should be guaranteed ’

the right to attend classes.“

Advised by an attorney, Don-
atelli and the YAF believe that

‘they can, should events warrant

it, charge the University with
breach of contract and make the
charge stick. They do, however,
envision the development of a
many-faceted legal argument.

"If we do take them to court."
Donatelli conjectured. ~ "they
could probably argue that it was
in the best interests ‘of the stu-
dents to cancel. None of us is
sure which way
would go."

Donatelli feels that the‘ L'ni-

A rumor.



that a student" confrontation of the ROTC of offi-
cers at their office on the fourth floor of the Cathedral Friday af-

ternoon alerted Campus Security guards to close the floor.

Informed sources indicated that word was leaky ,_to-Captain
Charles Ray. head of the University police. around‘ 3:45. The con-

trontationwas scheduled for 4.

Between that time and 3:55. the entire fourth floor was evacu-
ated of personnel. including the General Studies office and the of-
lice of the Advisor and Coordinator of Programs for Black Students.

Rev. Thomas Sayers.

Campus police were stationed at the hallway entrances to the
floor. turning away all students who attempted to enter.

A number of students with advisor appointments were forced to

reschedule them without notice.

According to University Secretary Jack Freeman. the evacua-
tion was completely voluntary. a decision of the ROTC command-

cil two weeks before apparent-
ly along the lines of the Amend-
ment was rejected byhis col-
leagues.

"Direct control of the exe-
cutive is otir only hope." he con-
tinued. “We cant force the
President" to spend allocated
funds in specific ways. but we
can cttt off his funds."

The Welfare Rights Organiza-

tion ol Allegheny County was
represented by Nlrs. Elizabeth
Powell. "We are here to show

that the America of the gram-
mar books is an evil lie." she
posed. "This is the land of the
rich and mighty. not a tree
land for Indians. blacks and
White college students with a
conscience."
UNITY

Mrs. Powell suggested laying
aside differences and ‘called for
’ a mass meeting of represen-
tatives of all groups to map out
strategy for_ the summer and
the fall."

In from Ohio L7niversity in
Atliens. a black student com-
plained that "just because‘ the
liberal conscience got pinched.

versity's first line of defense
would be one involving safety.
The administration could possi-

bly maintain that the campus-

atmosphere was too tensionfilled.
and that the slightest provoca-
tion would cause violence.

‘.‘Of course,” elaborated Dona-
telli, “we aren't going to be wav-
ing this threat around for each
and every occasion. We are de-‘
termined, though, to file suit if
classes are cancelled for some-
thing like the Moratorium.”

Donatelli first notified Chan-

cellor Posvar of his intentions

in a letter sent last September.
Since then. he and his collea-
gues have been working to pro-
vide the legal groundwork for
their plans. Last Wednesday. they
implemented those plans, at
Point Park College.

Don Sample. president of the
YAF at Point Park. related that
he threatened the President of
that institution with legal action.

“Following the march through
town to the Federal Building,”
told Sample, “we attended a
meeting of the faculty; Some
people there were in favor of
closing the college. The -Senate
had voted 10-6 in favor of such
a move earlier in the week.”

Sample claimed, that his pro-
mise to take the issue to court
was at weighty influence in the
administration's decision to ‘keep
the college open. '

The action at Point Park. ac-
cording to Donatelli. was meant
to be a testcase. It was only
partially successful in that re-
spect. since no suit was actually
tiled and the legal snares remain
unresolved. Should the YAF re-

P m'ain_firm. the climax will un-

the whole country was in an up-

ple have been killed and there
were no mass rallies to protect

Pleas for action were offered
by two clergymen.

Father Jack O'iVIalley believed
that the remarks of "Nixon and
Agnew calling dissenters "snobs"
and "bums" were no less "ex-
plosive than the comments of
Rap‘ Brown and Stokely Car-
michael who have been banned

THE RABBI

..Rabbi Fred Pomerantz of the
Rodef Shalom Temple -said that
"hope is something that you do.”
"The time has come, to stop
playing guerrilla theatre for the
media and get to the people
in the neighborhoods." he said.

In his introduction of two com-
tiiunity labor spokesmen. Dr.
David Montgomery. Professor of
History at the University. felt
that Americans were. "coming
together as they never did be-
lore."

He mentioned that the fears of
Vietnamese leader Thiev
were reflected in the closing of
the University of Saigon and the
elementary schools there.

The remarks of carpenter Art
Adleman from Homewood were
reminiscent of Jock Yablonski‘s.
"spoken one year ago at a May
Day rally on the Cathedral
lawn.

Chancellor of». the University.
Wesley W. Posvar. joined by Un-
iversity Secretary Jack Free-
man. expressed his views on the
school as an institution. an advo-
cate and a sanctuary. ‘

In an interview Friday after-
noon. Dr. Posvar believed that

- the nation-wide student strike is

an "Appropriate and desirable

for students to make a
peaceful gesture to express their
opinions’ and show. their con-

cernf‘

"To , have meaning,” he con-
tinued. "the decision must be
made by an individual. as a mat-
tcr of conscience."

CANNOT CLOSE

But he finds himself unable to
close the University without en-

-dangering the rights of dissent-

ing students. “So far as the ad-
ministration and the faculty are
concerned, we have a duty to be
available to students.”

According to the Chancellor,
the University as an institution
cannot take a formal stand, al-
though he avers that he as an
individual can do so.

Adleman called for "the un-
ity of students. the labor move-
ment. the Black Liberationists
and Women‘s Liberation“ to
fight the crisis. ‘ ’

The balding worker attempted
to clear up a "misconception __
that students have about work» J
ers." "Meany doesn‘t speak for 
labor." Adleman pointed out to»
his skeptical audience. “The .
labor movement does not support I -_j
the war . . . . . .. The war is be-
ing, ‘used against the workers-_
to enact ‘anti-labor legislation.
and to break the back of the lab-

AN OLD RADICAL

The need for change and the [ q
role of youth "which have pledg- A 
ed themselves to change here"'
was the theme of the talk of
James McCoy. The United States..
Steel (USS) representative. "an:
aging old radical". told his lis-
teners that the Cambodian issue;
is related to the other prob"-._
lems of the country. _ A

“What you’re doing today. If .
did thirty years ago,” he s_a_i_d.;
“Anybody who believes in_"=Cijv-~
il Rights cannot turn his ,back,
on ‘the peace movement iandg.
say that he believes in it.” ‘

Brotherhood and unity laced
the words of Mo Sieger, Pea-’
body High School student --who”.
criticized college students" for."
not supporting the efforts of»;
their younger counterparts to
improve their schools. ‘

politics. What ever favorable
effect that it may have on the
Awar_is far outweighed by the
divisive effect it is having on
the United States and the loss
in credibility of government in-
stitutions."

Jack Freeman commented on
the war and its effects on stu-
dent sentiment. specifically the
shooting last week of 6 students
at Kent State L'niversit_\‘.

“It's a tragedyjregardless of
where you stand in the political
spectrum,” he said. _“If the inci-
dent has any beneficial effects,
it is the sobering effect on the
seriousness with which young
people view the events in South-
east Asia.” ’

He believed it'will prompt
government officials to_ pay
closer attention to the opinions’
of youth.

The "Music .\/lakers." as they
are called. fiave made quite a
business out of pawning off the
“New Sound" to what's called the

‘Youth .\iIarket." They're so good
atit—tf1at copies passitoiand fro
hardly unnoticed and in many
cases quite well received.

Their sound is -what sells; their
longevity in the business is a
skillfull manager. More so than
not. “fade in-fade out" is usually
the final song for all but the ex-
ceptiorial.

“What then makes a hit group?” i

as compared to “why does a group

stay ‘with us in popularity‘?”r is a

question that most people out to
make it wish they knew. How then
does the Pentangle rate?

The audience seemed to gen-
uinely enjoy the show. so I have
to assume that the group did
something right. Their staging is
in accordance with such groups as
Vanilla Fudge. yetA their style
runs along the Folk—Jazz trail. As
musicians they are superb. As
holders of an original style—well.
that is debatable.

Such doubts rest in _a repertoire

cent of what it not selling at top

"new sound" goes. I could detect
no more. than a new switch ii.e.
one of the few groups around com-
prised of musicians who could
handle their instruments with
style that could handle their mu-
sic with finese. ‘ ‘

Whether they will take ‘Ameri-
ca by storm is indeed open to
question. Their manager is‘prob—
ably answering the question right

Editorial

Fear—uncontrollable. horrifying feat has gripped the lead-
ers of this country for the first time in its long "glorious” his-
tory. People in power have awakened from their dreams to the
reality that any country which reacts to the cries of its children
by killing them. is sick; deathly sick.

It has become a well known fact. that in America if your
want something changed. you must scream to be heard. And af-
ter your throat has given out, you then must make your body do

' an unnatural thing and lash out violently to make your desires

known. Then. of course, you must become a martyr.

It's really a paradox. that this country has become so reac-
tionary that it kills the people who love it and don’t want to see it
become just one huge murdering machine.

Government. corporate, social heads: is it so wrong to want
America and Democracy to be synonymous with the word
PEACE? Do you still think Americas youth are being killed and
injured because they only think thre's something wrong with the
country? Parents. didn't you teach your child that almost ar-
chaic phrase. Thou Shalt Not Kill? Can a country be sane, that
would kill a-person for trying to live that phrase?

World War II vets: think they would have ever gone up

against a fully equipped and well armed squadron of soldiers,
with only bricks -and tin cans. and sticks‘? They mighthave. but
only if their minds had been built up into one big mass of defiant
thoughts. They would look at their adversarys, and they would
see someone trying to take away the freedoms and ideals that
this country was founded. They would see someone trying to de-
stroy their home—make it something they didn’t want it to be. If
they could get close enough they would bite them. scratch them,
try to stop them in any way they could». And when they were
overcome, they would still curse them to their last breath.
. The parallel «is fairly obvious. Those Kent Staters were no
different than your parents would have been and others were.
They were protecting their America and the freedoms entailed;
or rather, striving to gather again the freedoms entailed. or
rather still, striving to gather for the first time the promised
freedoms. ' -

But have you noticed the obvious racism in the whole situa-
tion. When-Blacks were shot and killed in __similar situations to
Kent State it did not warrant so much national concern. The ad—_
ministration "regretted" the incidents, but there was no news-
paper which described Orangeburg for example, as a tragedy.

A m_other picks up a newspaper today and says, “Oh my God
our children are being killed right here in our home.” While
when that same mother reads about Black students being killed
for defiance. and demands of equal rights, she says. “Those poor
studentsare being killed"—maybe. 3

See the sickness of the country? Even the impact of a per-
son’s death is qualitative. But not many of us realize that out-
spoken Black people have been dying all along. trying to show
the United States what it really stood for. '

Students know that they face the distinct possibility of death
or injury when the protest—no matter whether it be violently or
otherwise. But isn't it a devastatingly horrible thought that
America's children would rather die than live in their homeland,
as it exists now? .

But we all are being duped. White students, wake up. Blacks,
wake uprlndians. labor strikers. women liberalists—all of you-
wake up. You are nothing more than pawns in that big prover-
bial game of chess called—our lives.

Youcall policemen Pigs. You vent all your feelings and
frustrations out on them. But it‘s all wasted effort. They are not

your enemy. The National Guard is not your enemy. They are ’

nothing more than pawns themselves. They are hopelessly
caught up in the talons of a puppeteer. and have no say as to what-
strings are pulled, and what they will be made to do. Their minds

are_not their own. They are slaves, but you are free. You chose
not be manipulated by traditional acceptance.

Those who you call your enemies—who you think are stand-
ing in your way—are nothing more than reactionaries in the es-
sence of the-word. They can only see something done. and re-
spond as they have been brainwashed to do. You must by pass
these men. You don't have time to waste calling them "Pigs.”
and “the Man." or “Redneck." Only if they have power. should
you attempt to deal with them.

_ And you all now who has the power—-for what is power in
America. but those little pieces of paper with a_ “founding ‘fa-
ther’s picture stuck on it. Those people who have that power. the
money. are the ones with whom you must now concern yourself.

Above all remember. reaction or action, without thought, is
suicide, or in the case of Blacks, genocide. You don't need these
spontaneous demonstrations and protests. You need a plan. You
all know what you want. it's the how that's the really impor-
tant thing now.-

To all those seeking change. I can only say. no violent rev-
olution is ever lasting one. America is a country built by vio-
lence. and that is the first thing that must be changed. Its easy to
change something by mere physical power. but a hell of a lot
harder to tackle race and other differences at the same time-
but as long as you are headed towards the same true goal. and

going about it ,fairly— the same way we can do it. We must do it. ,

  The Tension Is Mounting

Presidents’ Stand

(Editor's Note: This statement was issued
last week after the killings at Kent State Univer-
sity by the six presidents of the area four-year
colleges. The undersigned include: University
of Pittsburgh, Wesley W. Posvar; Chatham Col-
lege, Edward Eddy; Duquesne University, Rev.
Henry J. McNulty; Carlow College, Sister Jane
Scully; Point Park College, Arthur M. Blum;
Carnegie Mellon University, H. Guyford Stev-
er.) ’

We speak out of conscience and deep con-
cern. This week on all of our campuses and
throughout the nation the vast number of young
people of America have given voice to their
mounting anguish over the war in Southeast Asia
and the handling of incidents of dissent at
home. ‘

We know these young people well. They
should not be subjected to the ridicule ‘of the
highest officials of our nation. _

Our students are serious. troubled. and anx-

tious. Their concern over the future direction of
this nation attests to their basic devotion to their
country. ' ‘

We ask our- national leaders in the executive
and legislative branches of our government to
listen carefully to our youth. Only in this way

will their present frustration be turned to more »

productive ends.

In part. to this end. we propose that the
President of the United States .seek nominations
to and appoint immediately a Council of Youth
with which he and others will consult and which
will reflect as dispassionately as possible the
questions and continuing concerns of American
youth.

This Council must be fully representative of
all of our young people and should be available
to those in government whoneed to hear how
tomorrows leaders are reacting today.

Many other steps must be taken but some
immediate action is necessary to indicate that‘
this nation does indeed treasure its youth.

Senate Leaders I

Editor's Note: The following telegram was
sent to The PittsNews News Editor Bob Ging.
It was signed by US Senators George McGovern,
Mark Hatfield, Charles Goodell, Alan Cranston
and Harold Hughes.)

We share the sense of outrage which you and
other Americans feel over the war in Southeast
Asia. The recent invasion of Cambodia and the
-resumption of bombing of North Vietnam are
only the latest in a lbng series of actions that
mean more anguish and destruction on all sides.

We also share your sense of‘ frustration in
seeking to halt this endless war and senseless 7”

policy. We believe it is time Congress played
the role assigned to it by the Constitution in de-
termining our involvement in military adven-
tures abroad. This leadership role is admittedly
overdue.

This absence of leadership has had tragic.

results. We are shocked and grieved by the
tragedy that occurred at Kent State Monday. We
share a sense of guilt because of the lack of
alternatives provided by the Congress of the
United States thus far.

Wehope our present effort will provide a
emeaningful alternative. We urge you to direct
your efforts to supporting Congressional action
to cut off further funds for Southeast Asia ex-
cept f'or the purpose of withdrawing troops safe-
ly and systematically.» the‘ exchange of prison- ,
ers. and asylum for Vietnamese who might feel
the reatened by our withdrawal. -

‘This will come to a vote. probably within
thirty days when there will be an official roll
call on this amendment requiring every Senator
to go on record for or against continued funding
of the war. Similar efforts are underway in the
House of Representatives. _

Will you do all in your power to generate
public support for a victorious roll call to end the
war? Your letters, phone calls, petitions and
personal visits to your Congressmen are urgently
needed now and during the next three or four
crucial weeks. ‘

No 0ne’s In TheMidd|e

by BOB GING
News Editor

Last week. I_ had the good fortune to hitch around New Eng-
land. The students on college campuses in our northern states amaz-
ed me — more and more each day.

When Nixon came out and announced on that intricately pre-
pared map, that he intended to send troops into‘ Cambodia. almost
every college in New England reacted ‘vehemently to that an-
nouncement. - —

After the Kent State incident, schools closed down, really clos-
ed down, to. express the feelings of the college community for the
four, students who died as martyrs for the cause of peace.

But then. I came back to Pitt. and saw something that amazed
me even more. Here at the good 01’ U. of P. the strike foundered,
and students seemed as if nothing at all was going on in the world
around themf

The apathy shown by many of the students on this campus,
as opposed to the involvement of other colleges, both in this city,
and elsewhere in our nation seems to show that the fine tradition of
non-involvement at the University is still as dear as ever to it’s stu-
dents.

Keep up the good work, fellow students, and remember the
words of Che Guevara‘, “Not one, but many Vietnams.” Or was
that maybe Dick Nixon?

....Has anyone noticed how well inflation is being stopped lately.
According to statistics given last month by the government. unem-
ployment is now higher than it has been in ten years.

In case your wondering how this affects us, it’s a simple case

of no jobs.

vBy trying to stop inflation. Nixon has made. it almost impossi-
ble for college students to get jobs that pay as well as they have in
the past summers. If you are looking .for a summer job. and can‘t
find one. don't worry. because we are stopping inflation.

If this column seems to be aimed at our-illustrious President.
any reader who has «by nowcome to that conclusion gets The Pitt
News “Perception Award." ' -

The man who has been trying since the middle of November.

_not to notice the dissident voices and opposing views of “My fellow

Americans” has finally doffed his nightcap and admitted that there
are people in this country whose views are legitimate.

I hesitate to give the President The Pitt News "Rip van Winkle

Award." even though he can‘t really seem to adjust to this world
twenty years after his time. for Mr. Nixon. unlike old Rip. could

have opened his eyes at an_v time. 

Those of you who have been -watching the news. and who may
have heard the Presidential press conference Friday. may note that
not only is lVlr. Nixon taking notice. but he's scared stiff.

When the President asks number one son to cool his rhetoric,
fails to censure cabinet members for contrary points of view, and
gives aid to those trying to set up a demonstration in his back yard,
you know that he is beyond the point of just listening. .

The momentum is now with the anti-war movement. I would
imagine that Nixon is feeling pretty much the same now as John-
son" felt after one New Hampshire primary several years back. but
the only way to keep him listening. is to keep the pressure on. /

. Response is welcomed by the editors of The Pitt News.
Anyone wishing to make his views known may do so by con- _
tacting Virginia Joyce or Don Marbury at the‘ office, 417
Schenley Hall or by extensions, 318 or- 319. Columns fall un-

PRPSIDENT  NIXOPL-—Two vievvs of the manin thelmiddle.

‘Rip Van Winkle Award’ ‘The Man Has Courage’

Tuesday, May 12, 1970—THE PITT NEws—Palg§:q5.,ii

by FRANK DONATELLI

Despite the crescendo of criticism arising from President Nix-
on's_recent Cambodian actions. the decision to send American forces
to that country showed. in this writer's opinion. both wisdom and
courage. ‘

Wisdom because the military_andpsychological advantages to
be gained from such an operation could very well lead to a lessen-
ing of casualties and a shortening of the Vietnam war.

"Courageous because while the President certainly knew the ad-
verse repercussions the move would cause in some quarters. he chose

' to place’ what he considered the national interest above partisan

politics.

Militarily. the advantages were substantial. Cambodian sanctu-
aries, long a frustration to the American military. could finally be
desanctified. Within" the first week of the operation. over three
thousand VC killed _in Cambodia been available to attack Allied
positions in South Vietnam. American casualties would have in-
creased. the war would have gone on -longer. and the moralists would
have had more to moralize about. I

Fortunately. all three were averted by the Cambodian venture.

Even more encompassing is the psychological significance of
such an action. In announcing major U. S. troop withdrawals,
(Nov. 3) President Nixon stated the American position clearly:

Hanoi could make no greater mistake than to assume that an
increase. in violence will be to its advantage. If I conclude that in-
creased enemy action jeopardizes our remaining forces in Vietnam,
I shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with
that situation. '

I

_ In making his decision, the President had to weigh a number
of factors. The issue of Cambodian "neutrality" was more emotional
than substantive. '

One wonders how 7'neutral" a country can be that has harbor-
ed enemy troops within its borders for five years.

Not a peep could” be heard from Dr. Spock about this; but when
the U.S. sought to rectify this imbalance, the screams of anguish
arose everywhere this side of The New York Times.

The President probably did anticipate the wave of resentment
that would follow his announcement.

This was probably the main reason why this action wasn't
taken five years earlier.’ the'_fear of further polarization. Indeed
those college students claiming that the President "doesn't listen
to them" should remember this fact.

Had it not been for their vocalness, this action would have oc-
curred long ago. ‘ » ’

Now the arguments presented here will hardly satisfy‘ those

nutty few who desire a "revolution."
Nor will they satisfy the much larger group who ‘sincerely op-

pose American policy in Southeast Asia.

However, what I hope will be accomplished is the beginning
of a rational dialogue on this whole question as opposed to the emo-
tional hysteria that has passed for debate this past week.

Indeed it may come as. a surprise to some of the intellectual
cliques ‘around here that there actually are people at. the University
of Pittsburgh who defend what they had assumed was indefensi-
ble. ‘

William Buckley says that “though liberals do a great deal of"

talking about hearing other points of view. it sometimes shocks them
to learn that thereare other points of view."

Apparently, the University of Pittsburgh administration heed-
ed this advise.when t_hey shut down the school the other day.

If my views do nothing more than make people on this campus
monstrations like: cattle‘, then;

Kent’s White

Catalyst For

Violence

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

According to a student who
did his undergraduate years at

Kent State University. the Ohio"?
campus was usually conservative. ‘

Ron Wlotek.’ a graduate student .7
in Political Science at the Uni-'_"

ver tity was ‘concerned that what’
happened at Kent State last week‘
was not political.

“In general the political cli-
mate at Kent was never very radi-V

cal. never very intense. We could

never "get more than about 30 peo-

ple out for any kind of demonstra-is :-
tion——-ROTC. the Moratorium. org"
others. Even the SDS was destroy-

ed there last year.” he explained.

Wlotek traced the basis of the
problem to a lack of communi-
cation between students and ad-
ministration, especially

student teachers’ school.

The self-labelled liberal. whose f
sister was tear gassed on her?‘
way to class. in the melee last’
week, charged that "there wasn't‘-
even a breakdown of communi-‘
cation: there was just a total un-
willingness and absence to com-“

municate on the part of White.‘"_A L
“The administration caused the

campus unrest there." he believ—:
ed.

Wlotek further contended that!
the issue at Kent would have?
died if White (whom he com--j.
pared to President Nixon) had’,
not overreacted and called in the 1
National Guard.  

"We're not political people at’-
Kent." he averred. "The student '
newspaper has only the admin
istration‘s ideas in it: ‘the Stu-5
dent Government is the only pol-.3’
itical body on the campus after.

the disintegration of the SDS-."..“_..

Wlotek related an incident that
at, Ként‘ :3.

occurred last April ._
State which underlined his 
words. i 7

In an effort "to be done with-'
the radicals at the school". said’
the former Kent Stater. the Uni
administration accuse
the SDS there of disruptive tac-Ag‘
tics and summarily dismissed."
from the school seven of its
members without a hearing. I

According to Wlotek, a closed.
hearing was scheduled for S;
week after the dismissals. Th
students in question were threa ,
tened with arrest if they ap-'5
peared on campus.

When students got wind of
the situation. a large number of

students turned out in protest. jg
Again. according to Wlotek. 70,’
of their number were summari-V
l_v dismissed with hearings se
for "some future date“. "

The next day. relates the stud
ent. two thousand students (the
largest gathering in the history
of the school) massed on the
Presidents office. White called

He mentioned that the "Pan-
thers’ plans do not involve an in-
tensified effort toward the Sep-
tember 19 opener with UCLA.
At least, it’s no greater prepar-
ation than it would be against
anyother opponent. ‘ ‘

“UCLA has alot of ' people
back. "and we're awfully concern-
Cecconi said.
“But. they're also concerned with
the guys we've got coming back.“

However. he pointed out one
of their._ithe Pitt coaches» great-

i est problems—Junior College trans-

lt.‘I'S.

“They ' (UCLA) always ‘seem
to grab several players from the
junior collegeseach year,” he
said. “It gives, them an advan-
tage over us because we don’t
know anything about these play.-
ers.”

Yet. Cecconi isn't fretting too
about the Bruins" un-
known talent.

LCLA begins its schedule one
week earlier than the Panth-
,ers. Thus. "the scouts will have a
hook on the Bruins‘ competitive
ability as Pitt goes into its final

"week of preparation for the
1970 season.
However, Cecconi mentioned

that an eleventh game scheduled
for the Panthers before the
UCLA contest was not always
an impossibility.

"We didn‘t get to arrange a
game "with ateam that we real-
ly wanted’ ‘to play.“ Cecconi
stated. "We would have played
a game before .UCLA if we
would have been able to come
to an agreement with a team
that we were particularly inter-

_ ested in meeting."

Frank Gustine picked the right time to break out of his season-
long batting slump. Although the senior first baseman-led the Pan-’
ther baseball team in hitting last year. he managed to collect only

. six hits untilthe weekend series against Buffalo and Syracuse. * '

Gustine‘s timely hitting-against both the Bulls"and.the Orange-
men helped the ‘mitters win ‘ i  .
three out of fourfgarnes on the
trip. The Panthers swept the

the Panthers whipped Syracuse _

their six-game ‘victory streak’

The “New Morality”
sounds attractively modern,
but it is just the same filthy
brew stirred up by Satan in
the Garden of Eden, under a
false label. The Bible never
hesitates to call sin by the
blackest name it can find.
“Filthiness,” it calls it—not
“human weakness” or “psy-
chological instability.” It is
sin, corrupt and death-deal-
ing, and no whitewashing can
change it. .

A young man interrupted
an evangelist with the chal-
lenge. “You talk about the
burden of sin, yet I feel none.
