Luncheon Club Hears
Elliott Lecture Un Art

Members of the YMCA Upperclass
Luncheon Club will have a better idea
of What to look for than the average
tyro when they tour the International
Art Exhibit this afternoon.

In his address to the group last
Wednesday, Philip Elliott, associate
professor of ﬁne arts, explained the
more basic principles of appreciation-
of the exhibit.

“Form and accuracy of detail,” he

 

said, “are not essential to a good pic- -

ture. Often the artistic blending of
color and rhythmic lines makes a
much better picture than extreme at-
tention to defer .”

Dr. Freehof To Talk

 

Sunday’s meeting of the Jewish
Student Council, to‘ be held at 2
o'clock in the YM-WHA, will be ad-
journed earlier than usual so that

-ifnemibers may hear Dvr. Solomon B.

Freehof, of the Rodef Shalom
Temple. He will review I. J. Sing-

er's “The ‘Brothers: Ashlcenazi” at 3 -

o’clock in the  library.

What the women think about men
here! Whee!

This is the Year of the P011, it
seems, and so it is only ﬁtting that
the University co-eds should be
polled, too. But writing the results
is difli-cult because so much has to be
left out.

(Obviously, the co-eds consulted
must remain anonymous, because of
the present vicious social system of
fraternity pins and dating.)

In general, the opinions were not
ﬂattering. Some were unprintable.
Now most Freshman women ﬁnd “frat
men too cocky, no-n—fraternity men
too silly.” And‘ furthermore, say these
cute kids, “Pitt men look too young
a.nd they are very funny when they
try to be big shots. But they're just
what we, in high school, thought the
typical ‘Joe College.’ ”

No Polyandry Here!

The sophomores, who have had a
year more of experience, say yes’ and
no. “When Pitt men are smooth,
they’re very smooth; but when
they’re pots, they're potty to the nth-
degree.” However, their school spirit
makes them add that there are many
pots to the nth degree at Harvard
and other schools.

O-ne, questioned on the compati-
bility of Pitt men as future mates,
vtlought that she “wouldn’t like to
marry all Pitt men, but a few would
do.” Another said her parents were
sending her here to ﬁnd a husband
anyhow, and that she would make the
best of it. “The University is a very
favorable marriage market,” she re-
marked.

As for intelligence of men, a co-ed
of the same class was not at 1-oss for
descriptive adjectives. (But this is
one of those things that must be
omitted, as mentioned at the begin-
ning. You see how hard this is?)

On the other hand, a sophomore
who has a reasonably high I. Q. takes

Dance Tickets On Sale Now;
Four Awarded Passes

 

Sophomore Hop goers will do their
dancing at the William Penn Hotel
this year, Bernard Cashdollar, B-A,
chairman of the affairs, announced
today.

The Hop Committee has decided
also to follow the lead of last year's
Soph Hop Committee in arranging a
$2.50 tariff for tickets. This is the
lowest price ever charged for this af-
fair.

Tickets go on sale immediately and
may be obtained from committee
members or from the dean of men’s
oﬂ’i'c'e, Room 801, Cathedral.

Traditionally formal, the annual
affair will take place on Friday, No-
vember 13, a date which, according
to Cashdollar, has already proved
lucky to Rosemary Lutz, C39; Mar-
' garef Trus'sell, C38; Bernard McKen-
-na, G39, and Harry Zinsser, Med39,-
who were awarded tickets at last Fifi-
day’s Cap and Gown masquerade, as
prizes for the best costume.

NBC Maestro Austin Wylie, fea-
tiiring‘ the “‘S6iig'bird of the South,"
Miss Honey Lane, will provide the
music.

Forum Students Grate
On Campaign Issues

Political, Economic Theories Representing Democratic,
Republican, Communist, Socialist Views Aired
As ‘Nothing Is Settled, No One Converted’

By John Martinco

An oratorical atmosphere hung
heavily over a full house of students
gathered in Room 107, Alumni Hall,
Monday. The air was ﬁlled with such
stereotypes as “Communist,” “dicta-
tor,” “centralization of government,”
and “reaction.”

No, it wasn't any sinister plot to
overthrow the government. It was
only the last minute election forum,
“The Student Speaks,” sponsored by
Inquiry Forum.

All sorts of political and economic
theories were represented. Demo-
crats vied with Republicans. Com-
munists argued with Socialists. But
the venerable donkey seemed to have
by far the most adherents. V V

Chairman A1 Spiegel, C37, kept
the meeting moving with his corn-
ments, ﬁring questions at campus big-

wigs in the rapid-ﬁre manner of a
prosecuting attorney.
“What, in your opinion, is the main

different answers.

No Issues
“Reaction vs. progress,” replied
Sidney Horovitz, C37. “Ins vs. the

ness vs. the New Deal,” volunteered
someone else. Everyone had a. dif-
ferent idea. But then somebody de-
clared that there was no clear-cut is-
sue, and soon everybody had agreed’
that there was no" outstanding issue‘
in the 1936 campaign.-

Then Spiegel asked, “Do you think,
if Roosevelt is elected, there will be
a strong trend towards centralization-

a more realistic view.- “Except for
some football players, Pitt men are
reasonably intelligent . . . anyhow, as
long" as they are half-way decent'—she
di-dn’t explain “half-way,” as long as
they take you out, and as long as you
have a good time with them—what’s
the difference?”

Who's Not Intelligent?

A junior thought “Pitt men are
swell, but there aren’t enough of
them.” And an attractive senior, who
broods about intelligence, conﬁded
“The men aren’t so intelligent. Any
girl can get around them. This is
easily done by pretending an inter-
est in what they’re saying. There's
no man on earth who doesn’t fall for
it.”

The same co-ed complained that
all the attractive University men are
of the rah-rah genus. But she con-
ceded that “Princeton men are infi-
nitely worse than those of P“ .”
for the question; of marrying a local‘
man. “I’d' marry one, but he’s ex-
ceptional.”

All those polled admit that women
on campus are much more beautiful

than the men are handsome.
The men will say something--
later.

 

Curtis Club
Offers Trip
To Capital

Three University Students
Will Go To Washington

 

 

Three students in the Governmen-
tal Service Course will be offered the
opportunity to make trips to Wash-
ington next year.

The George W. Curtis Club, which
is composed of all the students in this
course, will contribute at least $25
toward sending them to the capital,
where they will have a week in which
to contact government oﬁicials and
perhaps secure positions there.

Seniors and second semester jun- '

iors, who are members of the club,
are eligible for the awards which will
be made on the basis of scholarship,
seriousness of purpose and personal-
ity by a committee of three faculty
members. Announcement of the re-
cipients will be made at a picnic to
be held next May or June.

The club at its last meeting elected
an executive cabinet composed of
Nelson Stitt, C38‘; Robert Saffron,
C38; Bernard McKenna, C3-9; Anna-
belle Knupp, C37; and James Mar-
quis, C38. They will meet tomorrow
at 12 o’clock in Room 225, Alumni
Hall.

The Best Activity

A FRESHMAN asked the other day, “What is the best activity
for a Freshman to get into?” When he asked that question

he merely expressed one that troubles most ﬁrst-year men. Just
what is the best activity? Well, the answer is so obvious that it
usually gets all tied up in a batch of copy paper, in a mess of Sta-
dium cinders, or in chorus footlights on the Nixon stage.

The big activity at this University, or any other, is learning.
Usually, the best way “to get into it” is by attending classes. The
activity, however, does not stop there. It should be chewed a bit,
the better portions swallowed, and then digested. When the class
bell rings, the process has not been completed. Reference libraries,
text books, even the daily paper enter the process. The road to
learning is much more orderly than popularly supposed. There
are no great secrets, but there are a few simple rules that must
be followed. Whether or not it is recognized, the desire mu-st be
there.

Why is it that German printing surpasses the technique of
the best in this country? Are they better craftsmen than our own
men? Is it due to their centralization and organization as effected
by the German government? Or are the Germans more interested
in creating, doing something really ﬁne, and less interested in the
price per column inch of “bleeding” a page?

Now perhaps a debater desires to explore these questions with
the idea of disproving the idea behind them. An advertising man
may be interested to know the latest advancements in lay-out, the
new possibilities as a result of new discoveries and ideas that will
“sell” more people than the present ones. A psychologist may try
to discover the motives behind the intensive, detailed, ﬁne print-
ing in the ﬁnished page. In each case there is a desire to know
how it happened.

It That Is Important. ..

to the student, then he will enroll in a course of study that offers
the information. If he desires a subject or ﬁeld that is not offered
in the curriculum, then he would do better to change to a school
that includes that particular ﬁeld of study. In any event, he must
desire to learn. Perhaps there is an activity which offers more
than any available course of study. In that case the activity, if it
is “extra-curricular,” becomes “curricular.” It is an unfortunate
situation when a student must use an “extra-curricular” activity
for his “curricular” one, if there are schools where such ﬁelds are
included in the curricular ﬁeld. However, no school in the world
ever provided all the curricular ﬁelds to satisfy the various de-
sires of those who desire to learn. That is one reason why we

' . have so many different types of colleges and universities, specializ-

ing in different ﬁelds.

If a student is unable to enroll in a school that offers the ﬁeld
in which he is most interested, or if, after he enters, his interests
shift, then he must make the best of it. At any rate, all universi-
ties offer background and that alone is worth much. Most stu-
dents, however, do have deﬁnite desired ﬁelds that are available.
When this is true, then there is only one answer to the question

of several slabs of granite wand-ering

Furthermore, to me a chorus of
pretty girls is a chorus of pretty
girls; but not so to Hollywood.
To the movie directors a chorus
of pretty girls is merely the physi-
cal basis on which to display razzle-
dazzle and peacock feathers. They
have the girls run through such
complicated squirrel-cage routine
that the identity of each female is
lost.

Just about everything that comes
out of Hollywood is a disappointment
in one way or another. At the mo-
ment the only pictures I can think of
which are exceptions to the rule are
“Romeo and Juliet” and “It Hap-

Editors: The Pitt News,
709 Cathedral of Learning.
Gentlemen:

Many members of Pitt Players
have protested to me concerning the
attitude of The Pitt News toward our
organization, and I feel that I, as
president, shouldpass these protests
along to you in an attempt to" arrive
at some understanding.

Two weeks ago our undergrad-
uate organization, under the direc-
tion of Mr. Cass, enacted the show
“Cock Robin” at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse. On both Mon-day and
Wednesday The News carried stories
on the show that gave us a certain
measure of student publicity. Several
reporters w-er-e at the production on
Wednesday, and a review and criti-
cism of the show was actually written
for Friday’s issue, but was not pub-
lished because as Raymond Maclntyre
apologized, “We did not have enough
room.” ' ,

Now, this situation is the climax
of a development that has continued
for the past year or more. Time and
again, T-he News has pushed aside cer-
tain activities to un-duly publicize
others. Please understand that our
bone of contention is not that Pirtt
Players does not receive enough pub-
licity; rather, we believe that The
Pitt News is not proportioned evenly
among the many campus activities.
Consider, for instance, a past Friday’s
issue that was not large enough for
our story. We ﬁnd roughly 138 inches
devoted to football; about 20 inches
to style and fashion; roughly 220
inches to advertising, and about 70
inches to news of which about 15
inches is off campus news concerning
Norman Thomas. “

In other words, about 55 inches of
space is devoted to all other univer-

= LETTERS TO EDITORS ==

sity activities, as_ contrasted with
138 inches of one activity——football.
.Do you think this is a fair distribu-
tion of space? ~ _

Of course, football is an activity

in our University life. More than
this, we are all proud of our team;
win or lose, and we like to see its
name in headlines. On the other hand,
however, we do n-ot think in all fair-
ness to other campus activities, that
football should dominate the entire
paper. As I understand it, The Pitt
News is a University project devoted
toward the furtherance of University
affairs. If we are going to emphasize
only football in our paper, why not
call it the “Pitt Sports Review,” or
“Football at Pitt,” rather than “The
Pitt News.”

With approximately 200 members
in its organization, Pitt Players is
one of the largest groups on the
campus, and I personally feel that
there is as much time and effort ex-
panded in producing our three shows
as there is in any football se-ason.
The present editors are former sports
writers, and their interests naturally
center about the stadium activities.
However, I suggest to you that a
paper that is well planned should
embrace all university activities with
some degree of equality and with
some attention to timeliness and per-
tinence.

Even Mr. Seibel, who saw our pro-
duction on Wednesday night devoted
12 inches in the Sun-Telegraph to a
favorable criticism of the sh-ow; and
to‘ me, it seems ridiculous to say
“there was not enough room” in The
Pitt News. - . .

I trust that in the future we may
expect a more fair distribution of
space among all University activities.

‘ Sincerely, '

ARTHUR C. KELLEY.

On the whole Hollywood seemed
chieﬂy interested in putting on one - 
of their inusical extravaganzas, and

I can go for at least twenty—ﬁve
more years without seeing another.
It seems that all you have to do is
to give one of those movie dance

thousand feet of ﬁlm, a hundred or
so girls, and several hundred thou-

‘Saturday.’-is Game At» Stadium Marks 36th.. Meeting In
Old Grid“-Rivalry"Between Panthers, Lions; Last

Year State Séare

Recalled ‘ By Pitt

Instead of throwing the Panther to the Lionsandthen look-
ing for th‘e-"Panther, as the Romans ‘used to do, the story may be
reversed’ this Saturday when ‘Coach Bob Higgins throws his Lions

to the Panther andithen looks

do that!

The game ‘Saturday will mark the
36th’ time Pitt and Penn State have
fought it out on the gridiron. So far
the records show 21 victories for Pitt,
12 for Penn State, and two deadlocks.
This series is the longest in the Pan-
ther sport annals, even longer than
those with W. & J. and Carnegie
Tech, which stand at 22 and 33, re-
spectively.

Penn State’s 19-0 victory over the
battered Syracuse eleven last week
shows -thatthe Lions are able to gen-
erate power on occasion. And Jock
Sutherlan“-d’s lads are not taking the
Lions lightly, especially since the sor-
ry Duquesne affair.

State Stronger

Last year Penn State had the Pan-
ther= rooters quaking in their shoes
when they stopped Pitt cold for three
periods and only ﬁnally were beaten
9-0 after- aterriﬁc struggle. Patrick
scored all the points on a ﬁeld goal,
and a plunge over the goal line. This
season Coach Higgins brings a much
stronger team to Pittsburgh and
should pack the sixty minutes full of
red hot action.

Economos, who was one of the
outstanding. guards to play against
Pitt last year, is back again. It should
be interesting to watch his play oppo-
site the reputable Pitt line of this
season. Denise, Metro, and Harrison
lead-the swarm of sophomores on the
squad». They scored the touchdowns
against Syracuse.

Every Other Game

So far this season in six games
Sutherland’s Panthers have attained
top form on alterating Saturdays.
They showed real class against Ohio
Wesleyan, Ohio State, and Notre
Dame. If they show the same form
when they oppose Penn State this Sat-
urday it will be too bad for State,
if they don’t it will be too bad for
Pitt.

By 25-30 Count

Winston Grifﬁn, Undefeated
Butler Ace, Takes First;
Cook Leads Panthers

Pitt’s able cross—country team, just.

getting their second wind in a vigor-
ous campaign, went over to Indianap-
olis last Saturday and strode away
with a 25-30 victory over the Harriers
of Butler University. It was the sec-
ond time in two years that the Pan.-
thers whipped the Butler boys.

Winston Griﬂin, undefeated ace’ of
Butler, stepped out and" away from
the ﬁeld to take another ﬁrst place,
this one clocked at 20‘ minutes and
six seconds. He‘ was a good minute
ahead of the next eight ﬁnishers who
followed in exceptional-l'y’ close‘ order.

Second place went to Panther
George Cook who hurrie-d as a har-
rie-r -to come in with the time of 21
minutes and 13 seconds. Only three
seconds later Alec Leggian tore into
the tape after Cook’ for a third posi-
tion. And on-e second later, which
isn’t a very long time, one of But-
ler’s lads, a Sid Tyner, whizzed in to
take fourth place.

Woodruff Fifth

Pitt’s Johnny Woodruﬁ’, the boy
who made good across the seas, ﬁn-
ished up ﬁfth pulling in with the
time of 21 minutes and 23 seconds.
Before the timekeeper could edge an
eyebrow But1er’s Prune wound up
in Woodruﬁ’s shadow a split second
after Johnny.

Mr. Timekeeper was a very busy
man up to this point and Harold
Tost, who took ﬁrst place in the meet
last year at Schenley Park for the
Panthers, swept in seventh, four sec-
onds after the
Shadow combinaztion had ﬁnished.

Two more ﬁnishers wh-o were
clocked in the 21-minute group were
Alex Zamborski of Pitt and Phil
Weine-r, Butler runner. Zamborski
had 34 seconds tapped onto his 21-
minute mark while Weiner took a
59-second addition to wind up in
ninth position.

Finishing out the placing, Rich-
ardson of Butler, Bono-rrati of Pitt,
Burthart and Petronis, Butler boys,
ended in those respective positions.

The race, once M-r. Griffin ﬁnished
ﬂyimg around the four and a half
mile Fairview oourse, was one of the
closest meets ever staged in Indian-
apolis. Eight men ﬁnished in the 21-
minute mark. The Panther triumph
put the Olson team even up with
the Mi-d-Western schools, having
dropped a meet to Michigan State’s
champions two weeks ago in Pitts-
burgh.

Dr. Carlson Protests- -

He Did Give Prizes

“What did you mean by saying
that I refused to give any prizes?”
demanded Dr. Carlson, varsity
cage coach, after reading a story
in The News to the effect that he
had refused to give the much pub-
licized awards for the one possess-
ing the largest extremities.

“They all got prizes, that is,
everyone in the tournament. Didn’t
they all have ice cream?” he con-
tinued when asked why he had not
awarded the prizes to the owners
of the largest head, feet, hands,
and the most unique uniform.

He would make no more deﬁnite
statements concerning the affair,
but it has been the custom for Dr.
Carlson to award everyone prizes
in the form of ice cream every
year. A possible explanation may
be that the big feet and head story
is used each year purely as adver-
tising material.

If an early start is allthat is needed

this year“ should be all‘ set to show
Syracuse, West Virginia, and the rest
of -them a. few -“Goldbergs” and “Ma-

Coach Jack Schricker’s proteges
will~~ move into their new. stadium
quarters today to begin three months
of conditioning‘ drills destined to
bring them to a peak by the time
February and. the ﬁrst match roll
around. Last Friday equipment was
handed out to 40 men. Additional
candidates from the football squad
are expected to swell this total to
nearly 50, however.

When asked Why he was starting
training so early this year, Schricker
replied, “Sure, the opening match is
a long way off but my boxers are a
long way off in their timing and most
of them are a long way out of wind.”

mentor will devote the ﬁrst month of
the drills to teaching the “technique
and fundamentals” to the more un-
experienced members of the squad.
Rope skipping, bag work, calisthenics,
and shadow boxing are on the pro-
gram. The more pugnacious hope-
fuls will have to do all their slugging
with their left hand only, under strict
orders from Schricker.

Additional candidates according to
the class they will ﬁght in are: 175-
pound, Bill Campbell; 165-pound, Art
Leonard and Andy Ventresco; 155-
pound, Paul Ashman and John Neu-
ner; 145-pound, George Terzis and

and Jedro Curzi; 125-pound, William

The worst football licking the

created the chief tournament upset
by eliminating Charles Wachman, the
seeded Number 2 player. He was de-
feated in the ﬁnal round by Alfred
Jarvis, 6-2, 5-7, and 8-6. The match
was set point in Bob’s favor when
the referee slipped up, calling the
winning shot out when both players
agreed that it was good. '

Madden stepped into the Number 1
position on the Panther court team
last spring; and continued to step
along throughout the season, which
saw the Panthers losing only one
match. That was the last match of
the year, played at Annapolis and lost
to the Navy. In this match, however,
Madden won» his two sets for a vic-
tory, as he did in every other match
of the season.

Madden toured the summer circuit
of “big time” tennis this summer. His
only championship was the Southern
Maine singles title.

Other rankings included Joe Mad-
den, varsity member last year, and
Joe K1-istufek,, Jr., a freshman at
Pitt now. They were listed in the
rankings of the second ten players.

The Fraternity Round—Up

By Ruth Belle Strother;

 

of government?” Somebody thought
that it did. But Bill Stark, C38,
couldn’t see how the Democrats could
centralize government functions any
It was
all a matter of who was in power, he
thought.

That question soon gave way to the
touchy problem of government spend-

ing. A brave Republican of the weak-,

er sex came out of the minority to:

complain that we would spend years‘
paying back in taxes the money
“wasted” by the government in this
administration.

“We’re not worrying about that,”
answered a voice of Democracy.
“That’s easy to say,” retorted another
Republican, this one of the male spe-
cies, “but when it comes time to pay
the taxes it will be a different propo-
sition.”

Will Support Roosevelt

Somehow, the talk drifted to de-
bate about the labor problem. The
Socialists, Communists, and very lib-
eral Democrats (and there were plen-
ty of them) said that they were an-
ticipating the formation of a labor
party in 1940. But meanwhile, they
were prepared to support Roosevelt
as “the lesser of two evils.” The gen-
eral impression of the group, with a
few exceptions, was that Roosevelt
deserved the support of the voting
class because he has helped labor.

Finally, Chairman Spiegel diverted,
the discussion into the question of
why students vote and think the wa_v
they do. “Have professors been re-
sponsible for any of your political
opinions?” he asked. The unanimous‘
concensus was negative. “Do you
think,” he resumed, “that the faculty
at the University is radical on the
wl10le.” Again a negative answer.

Prexies

"Ruth Gambrell, who is prexie of Alpha Kappa Alpha, has other presi-
dcntial d—u-ties too . . . this summer she was named head of the Junior State
Federation of Negro Women’s Clubs, thereby becoming successor to LaRue
Walker, a June graduate who is also a member of AKA.

Ambition!

With the date of the Women’s inter-fraternity sing moved up to Novem-
ber, we’ll wager that more than one group is planning to de-Kappa-tate
the Kappas from their position as winner of sing honors. Also, we’ll
wager that aforesaid Kappa’s will miss Kit Hall, who was always right up
in the front trenches.
