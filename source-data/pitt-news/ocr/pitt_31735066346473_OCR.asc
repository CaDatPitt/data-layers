BY TOBI ROSEN

One of three suspended West
Point cadets who sought permis-
sion to enter Pitt has enrolled in the
School of Engineering as a “special
student." I

As a special «student, he is
permitted to take a maximum of
two courses for which he will
receive no academic credit.
However, he must pay a $70 per
credit tuition fee. Credits received
as a special student may count
toward a degree if the student is
later admitted to Pitt’s School of
Engineering.

“It will be beneﬁcial to the

student when he comes up for

reconsideration at West Point,”
School of Engineering recruiter
Charles Aveni said.

Another dismissed cadet who
sought admission to Pitt has
droppedihis inquiry. The status of
a third cadet who sought admission
to the Bradford campus is
unknown.

The three cadets’ academic
status at West Point has been
termed a “temporary suspension”
for violations of the military
academy’s honor code. The three
were among more than 100 cadets
dismissed during the recent cheat-
ing scandal there. All of the cadets
will be eligible for reinstatement at
the academy in one year.

Police Call
Dorm Fire
A Prank

Pitt police have ruled out arson
in connection with last Wednes-
day's ﬁre in Pitt’s Lothrop Street
residence, -calling the incident a
student prank.

A laundry cart was set ablaze in
the dormitory’s ground floor
elevator. Three ﬁre departments
responded to the one-alarm ﬁre
and ﬁremen quickly extinguished
the flames.

-A subsequent investigation of
the ﬁre produced no evidence of
arson, according to campus police-
man Charles Brevard.

“We sifted through the residue
and could find no type of
incinerate." Brevard said, “In my
opinion. someone set ﬁre to the
cart not realizing the possible
consequences. The damage was
negligible. It was clearly a prank."

Three students in the Lothrop
residence had carts checked out at
the time of the ﬁre. according to
Brevard. but returned them in good
order. No further action will be
taken to investigate the incident.

I Brevard said.

No one was injuredpin the blaze.

Associate Dean of Engineering
Walter R. Turkes advised the cadet
currently attending as special
student to seek admission for the
winter term because it is “too late
for fall consideration.”

Provost Rhoten Smith said the
probability of January term accep-
tance is good. Smith maintained
the cadets have received no special
treatment as late enrollees.

Country rock singer David Bromberg played to a hill full of people

“It’s not for us to judge whether
they were guilty or innocent,”
Smith said.

Usually the status of “special
student” is reserved for practicing
engineers and others to continue
their academic study. No speciﬁc
guidelines for the classiﬁcation of a
special student is recorded in
recent School of Engineering
catalogs.

Voter Drive

Register-By-Moil On Campus

BY VALERIE STAATS

_ Pennsylvanians can now register
to vote simply by ﬁlling out a
postcard and dropping it in the
mail.

The postage-paid card form is
available at any post office,
borough building or the Carnegie
Library in Oakland.

A new law passed by the state
legislature allows Pennsylvania
citizens who will be 18 years old by
the day of the election and who
have lived in their voting precinct
for at least 30 days to register to
vote through the mails.

The postcard registration system
can also be used to record name or
address changes. The traditional
registration form is required t
change party afﬁliation. '

Pitt’s College Young Democrats
(CYD) and College Young Repub-
licans (CYR) will sponsor a
registration drive on September
28th and 29th._ The deadline for
voter registration is October 4th.
All postcards must reach the Voter
Registration Ofﬁce by midnight
October 4.

The League of Women Voters
and the County Registration
Bureau will register students in the
Towers Lobby and the Student

Union Art Gallery during Septem-
ber 28 and 29. '

Ousted Cadet Enrolls Al Pih‘ Schools Look to Pitt

For ‘Integrity’ Code

BY RICH HARRY

Universities seeking solutions to
problems of student and faculty
integrity have requested informa-
tion from Pitt pertaining to
integrity guidelines enforced here;
according to Alden Bowen, coor-
dinator of the University student
judicial system.

Bowen referred to guidelines,
established in 1975 by the Board of
Trustees, that set ethical standards
by which students must pursue
academic studies. The guidelines
also list obligations concerning
faculty integrity and. provide
opportunities for students to ﬁle a
grievance petition seeking a
remedy from improper action by an
instructor.

Bowen said he receives an
average of three to four letters a
week from various college adminis-
trators who request copies of the
guidelines.

“We’ve received a ton of
publicity recently,” he said. “The
letters sent to me cite publications

/ which have written that Pitt seems

to be the ﬁrst school to take steps in
establishing codes of conduct for
academic areas.

“I don’t know what the schools
do with the information I send
them,” he said. “I guess they are
trying to model their own codes of
conduct after Pitt’s.”

said the new postcard registration
will enable students from outlying

countries to register easily here on’

campus, whereas before the CYD
and CYR were only able to help
register students from Allegheny
County.

Pennsylvania is the 17th state to
appove a postcard registration

The New York Times and several
magazines devoted to higher

“We’ve received extensive cover-

he said.

Bowen cited schools requesting
the information
University of California at Santa
Cruz, the University of Kentucky
and Marquette University.

'We’ve also sent information to the

Society for Values in Higher
Education (a committee to improve
quality of student life on college
campuses) he said. I
Bowen said student integrity at
Pitt h.as improved since the
establishment of the guidelines and
indicated some students told him

Pittsburgh's Will Alton, former
director of Allegheny County
Elections and Voter Registration,
was vice chairman of the task force
which Gov. Shapp assigned in 1975
to study the issue.

Alton pushed the project because
he said, “many people shyed away
from appearing in a public place
and answering personal
questions."

According to Alton, Pennsyl-
vania also has pioneered a program
to give the Registrar access to
patron’s post office change of
address cards. Alton eplained in

A this way the registration office can

keep up with Voters’ who change
their addresses.

Pennsylvania is also the first
state to implement a non-forward-
able registration mail so that a
voter who has moved into another
voting precinct will be forced to
re-register.

Bowen said about 52 to~53 cases

the initial stages of adjudication,
but only a few required formal
hearings, “Most cases. were
resolved somewhere along the line
by both participants,” he said.

Cases submitted for review are
heard by the University Review

"70 Years of Collegiate Jourﬁalism at the University of Pittsburgh ”

 Now That It's Over

The sights and sounds of construction have been commonplace on
the Pitt campus for the past decade and a half. And there are few who
can remember a pre-Litchﬁeld University where jack hammers didn’t
drown out a lecturer’s voice, or where clouds of dust wouldn’t rise from
construction sites and cling to every object within a few blocks.

In the early 60s, former Chancellor Litchﬁeld started an expansion
programthat was nothing short of fantastic- Buildings popped up
everywhere and the University’s prestige grew in proportion to the vast
areas of Oakland it gobbled up.

There was a good feeling associated with Pitt’s expansion—-a feeling
"of belonging to an institution that was going places. In a sense, it is
kind of saddening to hear that, with the completion of the Professional
Quadrangle, Pitt’s expansion program will be coming to an end.

Realistically speaking, however, it is goodthat Pitt has completed its
farsighted program. It is now time for the University to consolidate its
gains and work on those areas it might have neglected in the frenzy of

I ‘expansion.

One area that has been neglected is the quality of life experienced by
the Pitt student during his years here. While new buildings created
more ofﬁce space, student organizations were being crammed together
in the offices of the Student Union. While the Law School was given a
spacious new home, the housing shortage in Oakland  acute.
While the University was building up a championship football team,
student activities began to die out one by one.

- As it was takingover Oaldand, the University wasn’t too careful to
cultivate the good will of the Oakland residents, many of whom
resented the University’s expansion. Perhaps now would be ,a good
timeto undo someofthe damage done inthat area. We cantllink ofno
better way to start than to get out of the slumlord business and become
a responsible member of the Oakland community. L

Now that expansion is over, the size of the student population should
not be allowed to increase because it would only aggravate a bad
situation in terms of housing and in terms of the University’s ability to
provide services to new students. ‘ V _

We hope the University will now stop looking for new neighborhoods
to conquer and start looking at itself. It should embark on a new
program that will improve the quality of education at Pitt and provide a
better activities program, with more involvement of commuters, for the
-Pitt student. 'Ihe University should tear down the deteriorating

apartment houses it owns and put in better, student-oriented housing,

a carefully avoiding building something like those potato chip cans we

call the Towers. _ . i._
It was fun while it lasted but there are only so many buildings that
can ﬁt in Oakland. '

  Hang from Nearest Pole

BY DEANNA LOUISE S

In the wake of the Lothrop
Street Residence ﬁre last Wednes-
day and blunt confessions by
residents that they hesitated to
leave the building becuase they
assumed a prankster pulled a false
-ﬁre alarm,_ a review of the
University’s prosecution for this
crime seems in order. I i

“We should have a program‘ to
look out for people who pull false
ﬁre alarms and hang them by the

nearest pole,” according to Pitt 1

Fire Marshall Gene Barry.

Barry said the University has
established a “different system of
justice by trying to keep these
crimes in the house.”

Although pulling a false ﬁre
alarm is a ﬁnable and jailable act,
university offenders, if caught, pay
lip "service, not to the city police,
but to the University student
judicial board. I

Of the last four false alarm cases
heard by the judicial board, three
received probation and the  
spent two weekends with 
chief checking and reﬁlling Towers
ﬁre extinguishers in the Towers
dormitories.

 

Assuming no one is trampled to
death in a panic to leave the
building, and assuming the hun-

- Kelly“ said.

dreds of dollars of taxpayers’ A

money squandered on one practical
joke amounts to only pennies for
the “individual, a sentence of
probation may be appropos.

But when people could get
injured in a panic, the board‘might
do right by cracking down hard on
‘ ‘ pranksters. ”

No one has been trampled to
death. If they were, perhaps the

.board would tighten its judicial

belt. But. after-the-fact decisions

—don’t bring people back to life.

Judicial board advisor Alden
Bowen said offenders must be
caught isn't the act and turned in to
the city authorities immediately or
the city is hesitant to act on the
cases.

J Why would the city be hesitant to
act on a case only oneweek old?

If willing witnesses can properly
identify the offender. forthe judicial
board a considerable length of time
after the crime occurred, certainly
they could identify them for city

‘authorities too.

Judicial board member” Lilly
Kelly explained the board has
several sentencing options.

Sometimes the judicial board
sends the offender a letter telling
hirnghghas been a “naughty boy,”
And sometimes the
letter goes on the student's official
record.

Well, today is Slovak Day at Pitt,
and anyone who considers himself
a haluski or pirogi connoisseur will
thumb his nose ‘at Burger Chef or
put his meal ticket in a day's worth
of mothballs and royally gorge
himself on the tasty starch
dumplings. Or will he?

So how many of you consider
yourself Slovak anyway?

Uh-huh.

Well, could you say, then, who is
the elected leader of the Slovak

people? Or maybe which part of-

Czechoslovakiathe Slovaks inhab-
it? Or how about what the average

‘ Slovak does for a living?

something that's griped me for a
long time, is that I'm as Slovak or
as Italian as some kid who goes to
Pitt who might be called Petrocelli
and thinks he knows what good
spaghetti is just because his great
aunt makes it every Christmas with
squid.

Now that might seem to lean
toward treason in a country that
boasts of a rich fabric of Old World
traditions, but the truth is, there
are about as many Slovaks in this

There is no foreign tradition
that’s given a chance here. Fly it
in, boat it in, smuggle it in with

your dirty laundry, and once it gets .

through customs, baby, you’ve got
a million antibodies that’ll auto-
matically pounce on it for the
foreign particle it is. Just like in
bacterial science, and for good
reason.

Good Reason #1:
imported cultures could not coexist
without forming some sort of
synthesis, which brings us to

Good Reason #2: This synthesis
or compromise of cultures only
amounts to watered down versions
ofs the original ones, making their
ethnic value equivalent to one-half
a Chef Boy-ar-dee meat ravioli.

Thus you have Ethnic Festivals,
International Villages, and Mini
United Nations galore, all of them
with their booths of second-genera-
tion-removed women trying to keep
this or that delicacy alive, while in
the meantime the corner Mc
Donald's is raking in in one hour
what the festival will make in its
annual week.

It’s almost laughable, especially
when the kid wearing the Poland
t-shirt knows only the country’s
flag because there it sits on his
chest. Ask him to face the direction

things that don't even exist.

It's with equal sorrow that we
can't escape the irony of treating
with abuse the true ethnics of
America: the old immigrants-

their outmoded ways’-and visiting
foreigners. Instead of mockery and

Pledge Rather

I’m writing this‘ letter in
response to Dave McDonald's
analysis of fraternities. Being a
member of the Pitt track team and
a brother of Sigma Chi fraternity, I
felt maligned by the extreme
generalizations _ of his forceful,
convincing and totally one-sided
letter.

Dave complained of noise and
garbage created by parties but this
must be expected wherever large
groups of people are gathered.
Also, new restrictions on rush

 
  

.-...Q‘*.

If the board decides to throw the
student out of the dorms, at least
he becomes someone else’s prob-
lem. But we all pay taxes, so that’s
not much consolation.

A student may be given a
substitute sanction, like ﬁlling ﬁre

"extinguishers for two weekends.

Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye, who reviews
all board decisions with the power
to. approve or lessen but never
increase a board sentence, said he
does not believe increasing the
punishment would prevent the
crime from occuring again.

The effect a weekend of ﬁlling
ﬁre extinguishers may have on an‘
individual behavior has its merits,
but is it severe enough to prevent
other people from pulling the same
prank?

Moye said he would like to see a
system that highlights the severity

.of_pulling a false alarm.

Such a system might save everyone
a lot of trouble, “ money and
sleepless nights standing on the

I believe that Dave's intentions
were good as he tried to show that
this negative view of fraternity life
should be changed. But I disagree
with his method of destructive
criticism. His limited view did not
allow him to see or experience the
true reason for fraternities-
brotherhood-—as described in Jay
McNamara’s letter. I He passed
judgment on something that he did
not understand and failed to search
deeper for more understanding.

The main purpose of my letter is
to urge all nonGreeks, especially
freshmen, to really look into what
fraternities are all about. Before
condemning, make an investigation
and ask questions. I believe you
will be more inclined to pledge than
to condemn. ' .

Sonny Dayes Jazzes It Up

BY GEORGE FAINES

5  obviously facing a problem.

Pittsburgh has a very limited
selection of clubs that cater to the
jazz listener and even fewer top
name jazz performers appear in
concerts here.

Jazz is getting bigger, but there

are still not enough concerts and _

only a handful of club engage-
ments.

One reason for this is that
promoters prefer to deal with rock
because they are so
proﬁtable. Whereas a popular jazz
artist may sell out the Syria
Mosque or Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial, a rock band can easily
pack the Civic Arena or even the
vast Three Rivers Stadium.

Fortunately, a few clubs exist
that. feature only jazz. Sonny
Daye’s Stage Door is one. of the
best and is located right in the
heart of Oakland on the corner of
Forbes and Meyran Avenues. It’s
atmosphere is very intimate and is
quite a contrast to all of the wild
and raucous bars that give
Oakland's night life such a
notorious reputation.

Sonny Daye’s Stage Door hosts
local as well as national talent.

Acting Group Tours Classes

. BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Ever since the. ﬁrst professor
tried to explain why the earth was
the center of the universe,
university instructors have been
trying to ﬁnd better ways of getting

’ their message across.

First came the black board. Then
textbooks.
the blackboards.

Even today, when every student

...»worth his or her salt is perfectly
clear on why the earth is the center
of the ttniverse, instructors are still
searching for the perfect instruc-
tional tool.
One of the answers at Pitt is the
M Instructional Performance Com-
"pany, part of the University's
theatre arts department.
According to James Gardner,
one of the graduate students

coordinating the program, the
company is comprised of graduate
and undergraduate students who
will literally do anything (a_1m.0St) 110
at-tydraniatize events, riots and poetry
for a professor’s class.
“It's a service to the faculty,”
Garnder said. “They send us a
‘note asking for a performance, and
we'll get together with them to
work out the best interpretation for
the needs of the course."
The company's efforts, Gardner
I stressed. are not limited to
literature or even the liberal arts.

«Q The possibilities. as Gardner
sees them. might be endless. Tired

life and politics of Henry the V111?
Why not dramatize the decapita-
tion of Anne Boleyn? Or how about '

‘ti cozy meeting between Adolf
Hitler and his whimsical sidekick

“The company is open to

dents, anyonc," Gardner said.

"You can participate in the
program as a structured indepen-
dent study for three credits. or you
can work wﬁeti you have the time.

its a great‘ experience for students
\\ho want to display their talent, or

__‘just have a good time." Gardner

said.

V A . . . . . . , . .

It certainly seems a ripe chance
for the. acting-minded to capture
some great parts. Where else

‘could a student grab roles like

Oliver Cromwell, or a stab at the
pathos and motivation of an ozone
molecule yielding up an oxygen to
the greed of a flouride villian
seeking only to complete its outer
shell.

On a more normal plane, the
company is available to recreate
choice parts of drama, as well as
poetry readings for the literature
professor thirsting for a way to
rejuvenate a classroom’s interest in
some dead civilization.

Besides boosting the instruction-
al capability of professors, the
company will start this year with
performances of plays written by
campus playwrights, Gardner said.

~ “Usually once the director gets
his hands on a script, the writer is
out in the cold," Gardner said. “In
this program, though, the writer
will be there every step of the way,

helping to make decisions on things
like props and interpretations.

“We're thinking of just throwing
the Student Union Annex “or the
Studio Theatre open for these
productions, and letting people
come in free of charge," he added.

Before the company can take its
place in the University’s arsenal of
teaching tools (including some
wonders such as the Overhead
Projector, and Computerized Assis-
ted lnstruction) there must ﬁrst
come the people and talent to
energize a professor's dreams.

To this end, Gardner said, the
company is holding auditions
tonight at the South Bouquet Street
S.U. Annex at 8 p.m.

“We usually don’t turn anyone
away," Gardner said. “That's not

what the company is about. We

check out what a person can do,‘
and where they can ﬁt into the
program. lt’s great if you've got
some experience in acting, but
interest is just as important."

“AII Screwed Up"
Isn't.

BY M. C. PILECKI

Now that Lina Wertmuller has
achieved fame and fortune (or at
least notoriety) with controversial
ﬁlms like Swept Away and Seven
Beauties, her earlier ﬁlms are
being dug out of mothballs.

The latest to be unearthed is a
very early one, All Screwed ‘Up,
from her pre-Giancarlo Giannini
days. lt’s a much more human ﬁlm
than her later works and shows
more of the influence that Federico
Fellini (for whom she worked for a
time) had on her.

The story concerns a group of
men and women who come to the
big city from the country and live
somewhat communally in an
inner-city tenement. The ﬁlm
follows their lives over a period of
years as they mature--or not
mature--and ‘ﬁnd many of their
ideals strewn about on the way.

Premiere Mars Pgh. Ballet

BY LEAH McFARLAND

Imagine sitting in an empty
metal oil drum for two hours with a
crowd around you, banging on the
drum, wailing, screaming and
generally bombarding you with
sensations and stimulation.

It may have its moments, but
when you emerge the general
feeling is hostility and confusion.
That was, unfortunately, the
prevailing emotion after Saturday
night’s performances of the Pitts-
burgh Ballet Theatre.

The highpoint in an evening
bursting with conflicting and
confusing stimuli was the world
premiere rendition of Othello.
Modern ballet is a style with which
the Ballet Theatre is not overly
familiar, and it has not had much
success in other performances.
.Yet, Othello resulted in a ﬁnal,
beautiful blending of dance,
lighting, costumes and choreo-
graphy.

‘ Top credits have to go to Thierry
Dorado in the role of the villian,
Iago. Dressed in a masterful
costume of green tights shimmer-
ing with snake-like malevolence,
his pas de deux with Othello
(Alexander Filipov) had chilling
dramatic impact. He seemed to
ooze around the tormented ﬁgure
of Othello, embracing him, whis-

pering in his ear, climbing onto his

back to
jealousy.
Throughout Othello, a kind of
horrible eroticism prevailed, accen-
tuated by the slowly clinging,
entwining, movements of the
dancers as well as the lighting and
costumes. In the ballet,
.loAnn McCarthy as Desdemc-ma
wore a sort of Ice Queen costume of
backless white leotard and tights,
not too different. except in color,
from the other characters. And
yet. it was necessary for the
eroticism, the desperation of
Desdemona's appeal to Othello.
The strength and the variability

spread his poisoning

, of thejlighting was also an integral),

part of Maria Sabina, the ﬁnal
ballet of the evening. However,
here excellent lighting was ﬁghting
a losing battle against the ballet’s
obvious shortcomings. I
Before Maria Sabina begins, a
female voice comes over the
loudspeaker and gives “a brief
synopsis of the story.” God bless
that voice and its synopsis.
Without it, most of the audience
would have given.up the ghost
within 15 minutes. In choreograph-
ing Maria Sabina, Nicholas Petrov,
artistic director of the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre, proved what he ﬁrst
hinted at in last season's Steel
Symphony—-he cannot tell a story.

Only in one scene, does the
dance, staging and costuming
manage to overcome the technical
handicaps of the production. As
other members of the tribe gather
around, Maria Sabina (portrayed
by Susan Stone on Saturday night),
she stands perfectly still with her
arms uplifted as though tied to a
stake while they abuse her with
blows and kicks.

Otherwise, the rather trite visual
allusions to the cruciﬁxion. of
Christ, accented by the otherwise
beautiful costumes, by the religi-
ous quality of the Choir's singing,
and by the choreography, effective-
ly kill any semblence of originality.

The choreography of Frederic

Franklin, co-artistic director of the

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, in the
Pittsburgh premiere of Tribute left
nothing to be desired. It created
that rare performance of classical
ballet where the dance is the
music. the music is the dance.
Surprisingly, Saturday night also
‘afforded Pittsburgh audiences the
opportunity to see prima ballerina
Dagmar Kessler. in one of her best
performances.

For the ﬁrst time, Kessler added
a large measure of warmth and life
to her already technically excellent
dancing. This was happily evident
in her solos. as well as her
interactions with each of the other

(dancers. W W

6

The excellence of dance and
choreography evident in Tribute
was carried through in Armen’s
Variation , a short dance choreo--
graphed by Alexander Filipov and
danced by Filipov, Gregory Glo-
dowski and Douglas Bentz.
Hopefully Pittsburgh will see more
of Filipov's choreography in the
future. He seems to be able to
transfer the ﬁre of his dance to his
choreography with excellent
results.

There's a lot of talent within the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. There's
a lot of innovative spirit. While
applause is warranted for both, it's
time for’ a little restraint.
Otherwise, the result will be
another Saturday night—overkill.

The title is a loose translation of
an Italian idiom that says some-

thing to the effect that everything ‘

goes wrong. That's what happens
to these young people. One
amorous couple ﬁnd themsleves
annoyingly fertile any time they
barely look at each other: After
only two pregnancies, they have
seven children. A woman protects
her sexual integrity for a while,
then has to turn to prostitution to
support her mother and siblings
back home, while her boyfriend is
absorbed almost unconsciously into
crime.

All Screwed Up, like Wert-
'muller’s other work, has the central
theme of ideals gone awryconce

reality sets in,"or;~irLother ‘words,’

the inevitability of “selling out.”
But this ﬁlm is not as hard hitting
as later works like Seven Beauties
It's also not so raucously funny or
outrageous.

Wertmullerv gets in a tew short
comments about class difﬁculties.

One is Carlotto’s eyes-only love H v_ L

affair with a young woman he
meets several times before real-
izing they are worlds apart. But
ﬁnally, the ﬁlm climaxes with a
particularly brutal scene (in its
suggestiveness, not in its actual
visuals) of a riot in the kitchen of a
large restaurant. The owner,
supposed to have fascist leanings,
is blamed for a bombing death
outside the establishment, and her

‘son is viciously attacked, a tragic!“
continuation of the ﬁlm’s theme. . .

p All Screwed Up is an easier ﬁlm
to take than its successors.
Diffusing the interest among so
many related characters instead of
‘focusing on just one, often hard
person has helped to createa more
human drama. The movie has few
pretensions and its scope of

understanding and enjoyment is
not limited to the Italian culture.

Panther quarterback Robert Haygood, scrambling for yardage in
Saturclay’s_win over Georgia Tech, was put out of action, possibly for
the season, after suffering a torn ligament in his knee during second
quarter play. ’

BY RON SIEGEL

ATLANTA, Ga. Proving that
their victory over Notre Dame last
week was not a fluke, the Pitt
Panthers rolled over gutsy Georgia
Tech Saturday night, 42-14.

The game was by no means a
cakewalk.‘ The 43,424 fans on hand

were sensing an upset when Tech

I

trailed 14-7 at halftime and Pitt’s
starting quarterback, Robert Hay-
good, was out with an injury.

But junior Matt Cavanaugh,
proving that Pitt really does have
two number one quarterbacks,
engineered a second-half passing
attack, featuring Gordon Jones,
that put the game out of reach.

Haygood, who injured ligaments

in his left leg early in the second
quarter, probably will be out for the
rest of the season. He was
awarded the game ball in the Pitt
locker room.

The contest opened as a battle of
the punters, with Pitt’s Larry

Swider the clear-cut winner.
Swider punted six times for an
average of 54.8 yards, including
kicks of 60 and 77 yards. His
Georgia Tech counterpart, Harper
Brown, averaged 41.3 yards on
eight kicks.‘

With Pitt slowly gaining better

ﬁeld position on each change of
possession, Haygood ﬁnally took
matters ‘into his own hands,
rambling 43 yards on three carries
to set up Pitt’s ﬁrst touchdown
midway through the ﬁrst quarter.
Tony Dorsett put on a burst of
speed from six yards out and
roared over the right side to give
Pitt a lead it would never
relinquish. I ~
, Dorsett, despite showing excep-
tional bursts of speed, was held to
113 yards on 27 carries. His
longest gain was 19 yards. “It was
the hardest I’ve been hit _in a long
time,” said the nation’s leading
candidate for the Heisman Trophy.
“I'm satisfied we won, but I didn’t
contribute as much as I wanted
too.” .
' Said Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors, “Tony had one of his best
games against a team that was
ready for him.” It was Dorsett’s
ninth straight game in which he
gained over 100 yards.

Cavanaugh, who until now didn’t
know whether he’d start each week
until near gametime, wasted no
time in getting into gear. After Ed
Wilamowski pounced on an Eddie
Ivery fumble at the Tech 39,

Golfers To Fill Holes  

BY STEVE SYBERT

The majority of “holes” you will
hear about for the next few months
are those through which you can
drive a Mack truck on a football
ﬁeld. But that’s not to say there
won't be any smaller holes in use,
the ones that even Tony Dorsett
can’t slither through.

Those holes will belong to the
Pitt golf team, which will begin its
season today at the Youngstown
Invitational, under third-year coach
Steve Petro, who, with five
lettermen returning, is looking to
ﬁll those holes with as few strokes
as possible.

I “Most of our golfers are local
people and they are very dedicat-

ted,” Petro said. “Because of that,
‘we should be considerably better
-than last season. If these guys live

up to their pre season look, we
should have a pretty doggone good
season."

With captain Bill Burkhardt, Jeff
Nagel and Tom Sweeney, all

seniors and junior Bob Kurey and _

sophomore Bob Elliott, Petro feels
he has a good, crop of golfers
despite an undernourished links
program.

“All these golfers I mentioned
are good golfers,” he said, “but if
some of the ones coming up live up
to their reputations, we ought to
have quitea team.

“But I feel right now, it's
probably discouraging for a devel-

F oping athlete, who is maybe trying

to earn a reputation in golf,
because of the limited budget and
playing time here. Many just seek
to go elsewhere."

Still. Petro is enthusiastic about
what he does have and hopes to
install a method of periodic
qualifying, so each golfer has a

better chance at breaking into the

starting six.

Because of nine freshmen that
Petro believes will someday, if not
right away, become outstanding
golfers at Pitt, he will keep 12
players on the team with the top six
of each qualifying round designat-
ed as the blue team, and the second
six, as the gold.

Petro will select the two squads
from the approximately 18 duffers
who participated in the initial
practice on Tuesday._ The Panthers
will then embark on a fall schedule,
which includes seven matches--ﬁve‘.
tournaments and two duel meets.
asked if he was satisﬁed with his
troops in anticipation of the season

opener, Petro said, “Completelyu

We haveten or 12 golfers that are
scratch players on their home
courses. Though we can't always
put our best six on the field
because of the way classes run, it is
nice to have some of these guys
waiting in the wings.”

‘Trying to field his top six at all
times has been one of Petro’s major

problems. In the matches, usually

six players tackle the course for
each team, but the scores of only
the ﬁve best are recorded. But the
decision as to how many scores are
tabulated is left up to the home

coach, who can designate the

number as six, or even seven, if he
feels his best men are better than
the other team’s top shooters.
“We had a bad tournament at
IUP (Indiana University of. Penn-
sylvania) because of that,” Petro
said. “We showed up with only

ﬁve players and they had seven.

They were able to throw out their
low scores.”

Following the trip to the Avalon’
Lakes Country Club on Monday,
the Panthers will face St. Vincent
College in Latrobe in a duel meet
Tuesday before returning to this
area for the ﬁfth annual Pitt
Invitational next Friday.

Tentatively, 16 teams will
compete in the tourney, in which
Pitt ﬁnished in ninth place last year
against a very powerful ﬁeld.

Panthers March Through Atlanta

Cavanaugh led the Panthers intq
the end/zone in seven plays. Pitt
kept the ball on the ground, and
Dorsett again plowed over the right
side for his second of three
touchdowns, putting Pitt ahead
14-0 after Carson Long converted
theextra point. 1

Following a missed ﬁeld goal
attempt, the Ramblin' Wreck
bounced back_to cut Pitt's lead in
half with an ll-play, 85-yard drive:

The big call was a 31-yard halfback

pass from Ivery to Adrian Rucker.'
The 31-yard completion, which
gave Tech the ball on the Pitt one,
was the only pass completed by
either team in the ﬁrst half. Tech
freshman quarterback Mike Jolly
sneaked across forthe touchdown.
The. Pitt defense, which had its
second outstanding game in a row,
holding the Yellow Jacket wish-
bone offense to 150 yards, set up
the third Pitt score. Cornerback
J .C. Wilson tipped quarterback
Bucky Shamburger’s pitch, and
defensive end Randy Hollaway

‘pounced on it at the Tech 4.

Cavanaugh took it in himself two
plays later on a perfectly executed
option, with everybody expecting
Dorsett to get the ball. Long’s kick
made it 21-7.

An Elliott Walker fumble and a
perfectly thrown Jolly pass’-to split
end John Steele set up Tech’s
second touchdown. Rucker carried
from the one for the score.

The noisy engineers were quickly
silenced by Cavanaugh and Jones,
Pitt’s acrobatic split end. Jones,
and other Pitt receivers were guilty

aofdropping several passes early in
‘the game, but his second half

ﬁreworks more than made up for it.
Throwing for the third straight
down from midﬁeld, Cavanaugh hit.

Jones for a 51-yard touchdown on a
post pattern that seemed to take
the starch out of Tech. Long’s
conversion put Pitt on top 28-14.

Pitt came back on its next
possession for another touchdown,
marching 72 yards in ten plays.
Jones made an amazing one-
handed catch for a 26-yard gain to
‘the Tech 7. and Dorsett rambled in
‘from the ten two plays later to put
the game out of reach, 35-14.

Tech helped Pitt run out the
clock by staying in its time-consum-
ing wishbone despite the large
deﬁcit on the scoreboard.

“We kept running the wishbone
because we have such an inexper-
ienced team and we were making
‘mistakes even with the wishbone,”
said losing coach Pepper Rodgers.
“Obviously if we tried to do things
we hadn’t worked much on we
would have made even more.”

Pitt cornerback Leroy Felder
illustrated Rodgers’ point by
picking off a Jolly pass and
returning it 23 yards to the Tech 33,
where a 15-yard penalty for piling

on gave Pitt the ball at the 18..

Cavanaugh made the key run of the
drive on a third-and-inches situa-
tion by following the inspired
blocking of John Pelusi and the rest
of the Pitt offensive line for a
two-yard gain that gave Pitt a ﬁrst
down on the 6. P

Jones made a leaping catch deep
in the end zone two plays later, and
Long’s kick closed out the scoring.

“I don’t think either team was
sloppy,” said Majors despite the
game’s six turnovers. “The other
team caused the mistakes. Both

' teams fought extremely.hard.”

  Haygood Injures Knee

BY RON SIEGEL

ATLANTA, GA.——The question
of who will start Pitt’s remaining
games at -quarterback was answer-

ed for Johnny Majors in a most.

unfortunate way. Senior Robert
Haygood, who started both games
this season, suffered ligament
damage in his left knee Saturday,

and will probably be out for the rest.

+of the season.

Since he appeared in only two
games this season, Haygood can
take a redshirt and play next
season. It is not known at this time
exactly how long he will be out. Pitt
basketball player "Keith Starr took
nearly a year to recover from a
similar injury.

Haygood was hurt on a four-yard
run early in the second quarter.
“My leg got caught between some

people, and I couldn’t pull it loose
in time,” he explained dejectedly
in the Pitt locker room.

“Losing Robert Haygood is a

tremendous loss for our team,”_

Majors said. “Of course that's an
understatement.”

The guessing game is over for
junior Matt Cavanaugh, who knows
he’ll be starting every game for a
while. The role is not unfamiliar to
him. He replaced the injured
Haygood for the last four regular
season games last year, including a
34-20 win over Notre Dame.

“Cavanaugh proved he could do
the job last year,” said Tony
Dorsett. “They say he’s not as
quick as Haygood, but I think he’s
a tremendous quarterback. I just
hope he doesn’t get hurt, because I
don’t know where we’re gonna go if
he does.”

Cavanaugh’s backup quarter-
back got their baptism Saturday
night. Senior Tom Yewcic and
freshman Woody Jackson both saw
limited action in the game’s closing
minutes. Yewcic is currently listed
behind Cavanaugh on the Pitt
depth chart. Ironically, Jackson
and Yewcic are both good punters,

“I was really sorry tosee Robert

came off the bench in the Notre
Dame game when Haygood was not
injured.

“I was pleased with my
performance tonight,” he said

Saturday. “I know I could do a lot I

Cavanaugh attributed his two
crucial short-yardage‘ runs to the
blocking of the offensive line and
the fact the Tech linebackers were
playing a little too deep. Cavan-
augh passed for 117 yards in the
second half, spelling trouble for
upcoming Pitt opponents, who now
face a very real scoring threat that
doesn’t wear number 33.

Grid Notes: Tackle Joe Stone,
wearing a special protective face-
mask for his broken jaw, got in for
several plays in the second half.
He was weak from his stay in the
hospital and didn’t play long.

Booters Serious, Bow To

Tough Davis 8. Elkins, I-0

BY JIM LEWIS

Does Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis
think he’s a comedian?

When he uttered the statement,
“We lost, 1-0, in overtime” to
national power Davis and Elkins,
was he expecting a laugh?

After all, Davis and Elkins is a
great team, especially at home. An
annual participant in the NCAA
playoffs, the team once lost four
games in one season and claimed
they had an off year!

So how can you expect anyone to
hold back a chuckle after hearing
that news?

Easy——it’s true. "

But on Saturday, Karl Largie
scored two minutes into the first
overtime period to turn a predicted
laugher for D & E into a Panther
moral victory.

“They have a pretty good club,”
Bemis said. “They’re supposed to
have three players of national
caliber—players who have played
on national teams of foreign
countries.”

Despite those experienced play-
ers and a solid team, Davis and
Elkins had its hands more than full

with a young Pitt squad that stayed I

even most of the way.

.“Our team played the best they
ever played,” ..Bemis boasted.
“The defense was exceptional.
The offense played a good game
inside the 18-yard line.”

Which is something a Panther
soccer team hasn’t donelwell in the

past year or so. What is Pitt doing

right this season?

One phrase can answer that——
young talent. Players like. Rick
Roccon, Karl Nigh, Craig Conolly,
Tim Pearson and Mark Nigh will be
around for a long while, promising
ﬁne seasons of soccer ahead.

Meanwhile, older players like
Kim Blasko, Tom Murphy and
Frank Bucci (who still has one year
left) will teach those youngsters the
ropes.

But despite their fantastic

performance, Bemis is still a bit

pessimistic.
“We certainly can’t be compla-
cent with what we have,” he

warned. “We don’t have the talent

that others have.’ ’

And speaking of talent, tonight ‘

at 8:30 Pitt will host the University
of Cork, ‘Ireland, at Pitt Stadium,
the same Irish team that just
disposed one of the best teams in
the nation, Elizabethtown, 5-4.

“The word on Cork is that they
get rid of the ball quickly,” Bemis
said of the Cork gameplan. “They
push the ball into a space and run
to it.”

That’s not all they do. The

University of Cork’s is a skilled’

team, probably because soccer is
much more popular in. Ireland than
football is in this country.

If the Panthers can do as well

V against Cork as they did against-

Davis and Elkins, then it will be
Pitt that has the last laugh this
year.
