Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld has re-
ceived the backing of the University Senate
and the Board of Trustees to appoint a
study committee to devise a plan for the
University for the decade ahead.

The committee will make recommenda-
tions regarding new educational objectives
for the University with an eye to whittling
annual deﬁcits that have ranged to $4.5 million.

In a joint statement, Gwilym A. Price, chair-
man of the Board of Trustees, and the Chancellor
reported the Board’s ﬁndings last week to the
University Senate. The official statement reads as
follows:

“The Board of Trustees has met and reviewed
the University’s present ﬁnancial situation. The
Board found that:

“On the motion of the Chancellor, it was de-
cided that, a decade having passed, the Chancellor
should appoint a study committee to devise a plan
for the University for the decade ahead. The com-
mittee would be composed of trustees, faculty, as
well as members of the administration,

“It will be expected to make recommendations
regarding new educational objectives for the Uni-
versity and its future role in its region, in the
state, and in the nation. The committee will do
so with appropriate regard for the practicalities

of the funds available for future development.”

John W. Chapman, associate professor of poli-
tical science, entered a resolution for a vote of
support for the Chancellor's proposal. It was pass-
ed unanimously by the University Senate.

The Board further stated: “The University has
made extraordinary progress in the first ten years
of its efforts to achieve national ‘academic distinc-
in the Upper Ohio Valley Region and in the nation.

“The quality of the faculty has improved be-
yond all expectation; student quality is markedly
better, the value of the physical plant has risen
from slightly more than $32 million to more than
$120 million, including General State Authority
facilities; the educational program has been broad-
ly expanded by the addition of more than .a dozen
new schools and major research centers and fac-
ulty payroll has more than doubled. V

“The University today also has broadly based
and ﬁrmly grounded research and graduate train-
ing programs which it lacked a decade ago. In
the absence of working capital and major new
endowment funds, the University has been obliged
to borrow to ﬁnance its growth in recent years.
As a result, it has incurred annual deﬁcits in the
past several years ranging from relatively modest
amounts to $4.5 million in the last ﬁscal year.

Disguised as Negro in Southern States

John Howard Griffin Speaks at Wednesday’s Midday

   

John Howard Griffin, internationally-known novelist, "‘
humanitarian, and civil rights leader, will speak at the noon
Midday Series Wednesday in the Student Union Ballroom.

His topic will be “Black Like Me,” based on his novel
and experiences in four Southern states while disguised as
a Negro. Griffin had his skin darkened to learn what it is
like to live like a Negro. _

After articles about his southern trip as a Negro appeared in a
magazine, Griffin was burned in/effigy in his home town of Mansﬁeld,
Texas, and a cross was burned in front of his home. Later, his family
received threatening letters.

He has lived in Texas most of his life, except while serving‘ in
the Army. While stationed in France, he gradually lost his sight be-
cause of a War injury, but regained it in 1957.

Griﬁin’s novel, Black Like ‘Me, emphasizes the mass psychological
damage inﬁicted upon the victims of discrimination, rather than the
widely publicized physical damage suffered by a small minority.

Although the project began, in Griffin’s words, “as a scientiﬁc re-
search study of the Negro in the South, with careful compilation of
data for analysis,” it ended by the writing instead of “the journal of
my experiences living as a Negro.”

His next book, Scattered Shadows, will cover the ten years when
he was blind. While blind, Griffin wrote two novels, The Devil Outside
and Nuni. ‘

Griffin has spoken at Yale University; Alliance College, Cam-
bridge Springs, Pa.; Edinboro State College, Edinboro, Pa., and the
Rochester Institute of Technology.

In early Christianity the Spir-

which for example, directed prop-

Later, he continued, the idea

not merely to the intellect.

“The dove as the symbol of the
Spirit, has the dynamics and ﬂu-
ency of myth and also real and
intellectual honesty,” he stated,
and illustrated his point with sev-
eral examples from the Bible,
Greek religion, and art.

“The special lunimous quality
of the dove is widely known,” he
commented. It brought back the
olive branch to Noah heralding a
new era as a parallel to thecom-
ing of Jesus. In several early
paintings the dove is shown. with
a nimbus or halo or in the center
"of a stmburst. “The dove has also
been the symbol of the soul,” he
concluded. ‘

In trying to relate the ﬁnal
part of his speech, Dr. Pruyser
asserted that “it is difficult to
perceive the dove as an adequate
symbol” of the Holy Grost. “It is
the function of a symbol to re-
veal the idea of the spirit is so
awful that any thinking on it is
prone to be incomprehensible.”

The dove was an image to pre-
serve order and “.attempts to re-
vitalize it as an symbol will not

  so Requests   Lem  
UrgingState Sales Tax

Remocual on Textbooks

By NANCY FUCHS

Student Government urged University students to
write to their state legislators requesting the removal of
the Pennsylvania sales tax on textbooks in a resolution
passed at Thursday’s meeting. SG’s Executive Committee
will assist any student in drafting a letter.

The resolution, introduced by Senator Dorothy Scalise,
is in support of a bill introduced in the State Legislature to
exempt textbook buyers from the ﬁve per cent sales tax.

SG will notify other colleges
and universities in the Pittsburgh
area totake a similar .action.

A bill establishing the standing
committees of Food Service,
Health Service, Library, Elec-
tions, and Class Organization,

"passed by a margin of one. The

opposition to the bill proposed
by Senator Jim Janis centered on
the creation of the Class Organi-
zation Committee as a standing

. committee.

Senator Marty Engels said: “It
is not a prudent idea because we
can’t tell whether or not the
Class Organization Committee
will work out.” Senator Mark
Senick, committee chairman, ex-
plained that the-organization com.
plained that the Organization
Committee merely organizes the

class committees, and the suc-

‘cess or failure of the project

rests on the class committees.

Two amendments to the by-
laws introduced by Senator Jerry
Hogan were carried unanimously.
The ﬁrst required that the incom-
ing vice-president and senators
take an oath of office. The sec-
ond privded for the appointment
of one or more senate clerks, de-
pending on the size of the Sen-
ate. The job’s duties will include
the preparation of materials used
at meetings and the distribution
and collection of ballots. ,

Another bill introduced by Ho-
gan regarding the Liberal Arts
Cabinet was tabled until Cabinet
Chairman Tom Zarret presents
a report.

(Continued from Page 1.)

“These operating deﬁcits, plus
contributions from current funds
to new building programs, have
created a real cash problem.”

The Board resolved that the
solution to this problem should
be sought in several ways:

“Major cost-cutting as already
undertaken by the administration
is absolutely imperative. How-
ever, this should continue to be
effected so as to guarantee the
major academic gains already
made.

“The University’s annual giv-
ing solicitation should be great-
ly expanded. It should be direct-
ed not only to alumni, but also
to friends of the University, par-
ticularly those who have not giv-
en in past years or have contri-

buted less than they might. The _

leadership forxsuch an expanded
annual giving program already
has been enlisted.”

The Senate consists of all full-
time professors, associate, assis-
tant professors and certain ad-
ministrative officers of the Uni-
versity. It meets once each tri-
mester and is the official fac-
ulty voice in such matters as edu-
cational policies, tenure, academic
freedom, budget, flaculty health
and welfare, and University pub-
lications.

» The bleak ﬁrst months of the year have always seemed to bring discontent on this

campus and the harshest criticism and suspicion of the existing order of things. Perhaps

:'it’s that peoples’ spirits are low generally and they are looking -outside themselves _, for

};.something to attack; whatever the reason, it’s time for revolution, the applecart must

be completely upturned, and the rosy view turns grey without realistic exception.

:  V But in this year’s set of complaints we reachedfor the moon: no longer were we
‘ just satisfied with Student Government, the Health Service, ‘Saga Food, or The Pitt News

 University was bankrupt. Cuts in professors’ raises and library hours, the delay of the
’i[HillInan Library, the closing of the Allegheny Observatory, seemed an ad inﬁnitum list
H  ~ of cutbacks made by a group of business executives who could care less about learning.
 , on We screamed as we thought about our vested interest in this institution while we

 quickly forgot theirs——we who pass through here in four years while they have a multi-
fr million dollar university on their hands. The y cannot afford to play, and the strong state-
 ment of optimism to come out of the Board of Trustees meeting last week indicates that

  They are only too aware that the last ten years were years of fast, dynamic expan-

 fsion; they took chances and incurred debts but this was the risk of such spectacular

,  growth. They risked it and they do not intend to lose their footing, for they are also

A ' quite aware that the next ten years requires a consolidation of this glittering blueprint.
 The type of honor that came to the University this week is something they have _

__ — I ’jamin Haseltine have been awarded the French Knighthood of the Academic Palms, a

kind of academic excellence we cannot lose, and with strength of purpose like that ex-
pressed at the recent Trustees’ meeting, we won’t.

 

 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

 Instructor ‘Hails’

Q 0
American Legion
 Editor, The Pitt News:

Well, God bless the American
Legion! Where would we be with-
out its vigilant custodianship of

‘the moral health of the Republic?
What would happen to the Amer:
ican University without the Le-
gion to protect it from the wily

, subversive, the twisted “intellec-

" V tual,” the sneaky anarchists of
the anti-football-fraternity-patriot

V ,5 ism crowd? (For that matter,
I . what would the American Left
do for its new recruits without

the good old Legion there to

— drive our college youth, gagging,

. to the left?)

My outpouring of gratitude, as

you ‘will have guessed by now, is

prompted by Legion Commander I

I ' Donald Johnson’s denunciation,
printed in these pages Feb. 8, of
. the student demonstrations at
' . Berkeley.
I These events — which some of
the more gullible of our academic
’ brethren have seen as an indica-
tion of a genuine problem of
student identity in the modern
, Academy, raising a legitimate
question as to its fundamental
' direction and purpose — have
» fortunately been revealed by the
‘- Commander to be the product of
a communist conspiracy.

 Now, there are some, I fear,
"  who will make light of the Com-
‘ mander, and suggest that he is
not, shall we say, one of nature's
deeper thinkers. These scoifers
- ' (and a sorry lot they are: pseudo-
 .i.ntellectu.als, beatniks, beardniks,
Iimpniks and such like. They
 should all be made to play foot-
ball, and salute the ﬂag), before
_ they close their minds to. the
.  . honest thinking of this plain,
 blunt patriot, should reﬂect
 whether the same malign forces
 that promoted the shameful Berk-
eley affair may not be at work
right here at Pitt.

As a matter of fact, they are.
In recent days I have discerned
certain rumblings of discontent
._ issuing from the entrails of our
student body. It is clear that the
trouble makers are already at
‘ their dirty work, sowing dissen-
sion among the impressionable,
creating distrust of the universi-
‘.ty administration, and so. on. The
V whole tribe. of the disgruntled:

 

 

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

the academic failures; the moral
nihilists; the compulsive atten-
tions seekers; the puny book-
Wonns who can’t get girls (or
more likely, boys), and all the
rest of them—-are about to assault
us with a carefully articulated
chorus of impudent complaint.
Revolution is in the air; the
tranquility of our happy little
community of scholars is threat-
ened.

Let us therefore heed Com-
mander Johnson’s warning be-
fore the disaster is upon us. Now
is the time for all good men
whose hearts beat true for the
red, white and blue, the Pitt Pan-
ther, the forces of law and order,
etc., etc., to rally ’round the ﬂag,

and, joining hands with Comman- _

der Johnson and his minions, re-

sist the insidious efforts now be-

ing mounted to bolshevize the"

University of Pittsburgh.

Johnson’s Idea

Editor, The Pitt News:

It was encouraging to learn
of the American Legion’s support
for the banning of speaker's
whose subject matter is an un-

- popular ideology i.e. Communism

(The Pitt News, Feb. 8). Further-
more", it is gratifying to know
that freedom of speech will con-
tinue to be guaranted to those
whose beliefs don’t tend to dis-
turb the status quo.

Mr. Johnson’s statements will,
of course, be welcomed by those
people who believe that learning
is best achieved by indoctrinat-
ing people into the good, good-
American—way of life and sup-
pressing all utterances of the bad,
bad—any but American-way of
life. -

Fortunately, these people are

in the minority, and most of us’

welcome and are ready to de-
fend the right to hear all the
views on any issue—regardless
of their popularity. Cheating
(there's that word again) is,
hopefully, not popular, and if we
apply Mr. Johnson’s line of rea-
soning which led him to express
the need for a ban on communist
speakers we would be led to the

_ conclusion that there is likewise ‘-

a need for banning discussions
of cheating. (Heaven only knows
how many impressionable young
minds have been converted to
cheating through exposure to the
articles in The Pitt News!)

No doubt Mr. J ohnson’s interest
in the welfare of the American
way of life is sincere, but censor-
ship of ideas is contrary to the
fundamentals of our way of life.
Therefore, I earnestly hope that

' any attempts by the American

Legion to achieve their ban on

speakers will be quickly defeated.

Editor, The Pitt News:

With all the recent documenta-
tion on student cheating and cer-
tain accusations from students
that some of the faculty may be
indifferent to the problem, let me
add to the record the kind of
‘‘lesser crime” which has recently
taken place in reference to ,my
course, Biology 85 (Genetics). It
is quite disturbing to me and
should be of concern to you.

On.Feb. 2 and 3, eight labora-
tory section quizzes were posted
on the bulletin board outside
room 205 Clapp Hall. One hun-
dred and thirteen students had
each taken a quiz the previous
week, and since I feel that quizzes
are an educational experience, it
was necessary for each student
to compare his own experience
with that of his colleagues. On
Thursday morning the bulletin
board had been rudely cleaned
off. Thumb tacks were all in
place and torn paper was cling-
ing to many of them. Someone
felt that he needed all of these
quizzes more desperately than
anyone else in the class.

Of course, the joke will be
that those quiz questions will
never be used again since the
textbook will be a new one and
course content will be drastically
revised next fall, The immediate
loss at this time for students in
Biology 35 will have to be de-
privation of the privilege of
studying quiz results in the fu-
ture. ‘

It is sad indeed that any ‘uni-
versity student should indulge in

. such a petty device.

n (Un)   vent 111 Day

 By Lmda Goldstem

I started out for McKeesport last Monday as a staunch
Democrat. My assignment was to witness Sen. Robert Ken-
nedy dedicate a nine—foot statue of ' his brother, the late
President John F. Kennedy. I returned to Pittsburgh later
that day seriously considering changing my affiliation to
the Republican Party.

Even the most ardent Democrat would weaken when
faced with such obstacles as waiting for a ride that had
already left and rushing in a taxi to
write up a story that had fallen
through. .

. An unrelayed message caused me
to miss my ride to McKeesport with
the KDKA-TV cameraman, and I
sped to the site of the dedication, only
to be confronted with thousands of
people who blocked my way to the
podium. Waving my Pitt News press
card frantically, which impressed the
- — —- -. V. standers-by, I made my way to the
MISS G01-DSTEIN front, accompanied by such cries as
“she’s stepping all over my children” and “why couldn’t she
go the other way ‘.7’

    

AFTER CRAWLING under the ropes that restrained-

the excited spectators, I found myself face-to-face with
Marvin Zelkowitz, who had been assigned by another Pitt
News editor to..cover the same story. Three classes cut, a
$5 taxi fare, two reporters on the identical assigmnent, a
two-inch runner in my stockings—everything was worth
the prospect of seeing Bobby Kennedy. Surely the law of
averages would justify all my mishaps.

The news that I should have expected soon came. Ken-
nedy was ‘stranded in Washington. He had cancelled his
reservation on the assumption that the ﬂight was being
delayed. The plane did leave on schedule, but Kennedy was
not able to get to the airport in time.

Good hams that they are, the Democrats didn’t miss
the opportunity to utilize the 5000 people that were lining
the streets to see Kennedy. They deceived the onlookers
by not informing them of the cancellation and delayed the
program one hour while they tried to locate substitute
speakers. .

Every Democrat on the platform was able and willing
to rise to the occasion by saying “a few words” on the sub-
ject of the late President amidst the torrents of rain, and
each speaker reached to the depths of his mind for every
cliche he knew.. And almost every citizen of McKeesport,
both on the speakers’ podium and in the audience, was intro-
duced on at least one occasion by the mayor.

THERE WAS N0 escape. We were surrounded by the
deafening noises of the McKeesport High School band and
the multitude of people. But desparate people can often
overcome the odds out of necessity alone. When the third
substitute speaker, State Supreme Court Justice Michael
Musmanno, began his flamboyant oratory, we could take it
no longer. We followed the KDKA cameraman out of the
park and soon were on our way home.

l””Berkeley Problem    
ed at Forum

By PETE HORN

L Debat

When the student descends from the ivory tower heis
beseeched, or even coerced, back up. Last fall, the students
of the University of California at Berkeley rebelled against
such a state of affairs. The largest gathering in the two-
year history of the Liberal Forum listened to political sci- .
ence Professor Carl Beck, lawyer Woody Turner and William
Pitt Debate Union president Wolf Swoboda debate the sig-
niﬁcance of Berkeley last Wednesday night in Gustines’ back

'I'00II1.

Dr. Beck, speaking ﬁrst, described how the Berkeley
administration passed a rule forbidding recruitment of stu-

dents for off-campus activities.
The trouble arose because the
students were not given the same
rights as any other citizens. Dr.
Beck emphasized that the rule

“Kr should never have existed.

Golden -toned former WPDU
President Woody Turner assert-
ed that civil disobedience is not
justiﬁable when there is only “in
justice, wrong and evil.” There
must also be no way of rectify-
ing the situation within the pre-
scribed framework. Unfortunate-

Swoboda contrasted the Ameri-
can “multiversity” with Euro-

dent is accepted by society as a
creative, dynamic social force.
“ Adopting a popular catch-phrase,
Swoboda claimed that Berkeley
showed how American students
are beginning to rebel against
computer-style “alienation.” It
amounts, he said, to a struggle

the insensitive administrators,
who should be only “janitors and

Turner observed that

secretaries,” and not formulators
of moral principles. Students
should act “not with regard for
the janitor’s opinion.” Swoboda
concluded that when an admin-
istration acts unilaterally, and
ignores student concern, “the fes-
tering sores will break out into
an open problem.”

In the discussion after the open-
ing statements, while the Lib-
erals waxed liberal, the few Tur-
nerian conservatives re-empha-
sized the conservative notion that
the institution should be able to
protect itself. Throughout, Tur-
ner never spoke of rules as
means. Because of his way of
conceptualizing, he dealt consis-
tently with rules,. both of con-
duct and procedure, as ends. He
said, “We have to look at the
manner in which rules are being
challenged.” Later he comment-
ed, “Societies depend for -their
existence .upon rule-obedience.”
“The school may have certain
rights to sanction student activ-
ities which they consider detri-
mental to the educational pro-
cess.”

The ‘_‘liberal” faction stressed

futile attempts at Berkeley to
communicate with the adminis-

The, important questions culled
from the Liberal Forum were:

—Did, the students go through
the legal procedures with their
grievances, and obtain no re-
dress?

—Do students have the same
rights as citizens under a gov-
emment?

—Were the riots symptomatic
of larger problems within the
changing multiversity? _

-—What is the proper manner
in which to make rules at a uni-
versity, and to challenge them?

Matmen Boni Loses First Match;

Cornell Defeats Wrestlers, 21 - 11

By BILL CABIN
Dino Boni lost his first
match this season Saturday,
as Cornell beat the wrestling
team, 21-11. The wrestlers
now have a 4-4 record with

— two meets remaining in the

season.

Boni went to Cornell with a
5-0-1 record, being undefeated in
the 137-pound division, and hav-
ing a draw in a 147-pound match.
His opponent, sophomore Don
New, had [no previous varsity ex-
perience, but defeated Boni, 7-1,

_ in ‘his varsity debut.

Besides Boni’s loss, Mike John-
son was unable to wrestle be-
cause of the ﬂu. A knee injury
early in the season and this ill-
ness have made the usually de-
pendable Johnson a sporadic

starter. He has only wrestled in

Close, but not enough.

ﬁve of the team's eight meets,
posting a 4-1 mark.

Tony Libcrati wrestled in J ohn-
son’s 130-pound match, losing to
Tom Meldrim. Meldrim had not
been scheduled to wrestle ear-
lier last week, but coach Jim Mil-
ler reshuffled his lineup, placing
captain Neal Orr. the regular 130-
pounder, in the 123-pound match.

“Liberati did a good job,” said
coach Rex Peery. “He hasn't won
a match this season, but when 1
need someone to wrestle in the
123 or 130-pound class, he al-
ways gives a good showing,” add-
ed Peery. “He almost won.” Li-
berati has an 0-2-1 record, and
has been wrestling for Heniff and
Johnson during their injuries.

Despite Boni’s loss and John-

son's absence, the meet was tied — '

11-11 going into the 191-pound
match with Bill Bodle facing Cor-
nell's Clarence Buchwald.

Bodle, however, could not han-
dle the more experienced Buch-
wald, being pinned at 3:57. Buch-
wald was academically" ineligible
last semester, but won the 1963
191-pound title in the Eastern
Freshman Tournament. _ ‘

Bill Beck followed Bodle‘s
plight as Cornell’s Rich Moor:
pinned him at 4:52. Bodle and
Beck now have a combined fec-
ord of 1-8, Bodle being 1-4 and
Beck having an 0-4 mark.

Three wrestlers, however, sal-

vaged wins, despite the team’:

loss. Tom Baily won his fourth
consecutive match in two weeks,
beating Mike Agone, 13-1, in the
157-pound match. Baily had a

Basketball Team Goes for 

Sixth Victory Against Owls

B)’ FRANK SMIZIK
Fighting another tailspin the Panther basketball team
will try and ﬁnd the winners’ circle again when they meet
Temple in Philadelphia tomorrow night, at 9:15 p.m.

Coach Bob Timmons’ big headache will be Jim Williams, ,.,-

a high scoring 6-foot -8 center whose shooting and rebound- "
mg determine the Owls’ fortunes. “(Paul) Kreiger did a
good job on him last year; (Jim) LaValley will have to stop

him now,” said Timmons.

The Panthers will bring a 5-12 record to the -Palestra.
Their 12th loss came Saturday night as William & Mary

edged the Panthers, 63-61, with a
last second shot by Martie Morris.
Morris hit the last second 15-
footer over the outstretched
hands-of two defending Panthers
just before the ﬁnal buzzer sound-
ed. The Indians froze the ball
for one minute and six seconds,
after Larry Szykowny tied the
score at 61-61.

The big difference in the game
in favor of the Indians was the
rebound advantage. They out re-
bounded the Panthers almost two
to one grabbing 58 to the Pan-
thers 30. '

“Our big men were weak un-
der the boards; William & Mary
weren't much bigger than us and
were just hustling more, while
our men wouldn't box them out,"
said Timmons.

“The whole team did play a’
good defensive game, and we %

‘forced them into a lot of mis-
takes,” said Timmons. “Our

guards especially did a good job‘ i

on defense, Szykowny held Walt
Weak, their best, scorer, to ﬁve
points.”

The actual number of tum-
overs the Panthers forced on the
Indians was 24. They played a
tight zone press the entire game

and were successful especially in

the first half when they left the

Anderson Sets School Record
But Swimmers Lose, 52-43

By GEORGE LE ,
North Carolina State defeated the Panther swimming
team, 52-43, last Saturday despite Bruce Anderson’s estab-
lishment of a new school record in the 200-yard breaststroke.

Winning the opening two
events, the 400-yard medley
relay and the 200-yard free-
style, the Wolfpack maintained a

«constant lead throughout the

meet to raise their record to 10-1
for the year. ‘

Andy James broke State's
streak by earning his ﬁfth-victory
in the 50-yard freestyle. Ed Cole-
man scored 254.5 points in the
three-meter diving competition,
his best effort of the year, giving,
the Panthers their second of four
ﬁrsts,

Anderson bettered by two sec-
onds the old mark set in 1962
by Dennis Mollugh as he. swam
the breastroke in 2:29.5. In past

dual meets, he flirted with the .

record but he never ﬁnished ﬁrst.
a requirement because the offi-
cials’ watches only recognize the
winning time.

Gaining its fourth triumph in
six meets, the 400-yard freestyle
relay team comprised of James,
Tom Ribarchak, Mike Olesak, and
Gary Martin accounted for the
swimmers’ fourth ﬁrst. Martin
also earned seconds in the 200-
yard freestyle and the 200-yard
butterﬂy while Ribarchak, an-
other three-event, man, placed
second in the 100-yard freestyle.

Backstroker Bob Dattola, who
placed third in his event, said

 

that the swimmers -don’t. worry’

in shape so they can swim -two
and three events,” he said‘. “Of
course, it takes longer to build
yourself for more events and
longer to shape upfor each one.”

In Saturday’s meet, State grab-
bed wins in ﬁve additional races.
Pat Gavaghan, 1964 ACC free-
style champion, _ led the Wolf-
pack with victories in the 200
and 500-yard freestyle.

Ron Worth, who set a North
Carolina State record in the 200-
yard backstroke, and John White.
in the 200-yard butterfly scored
points in their specialties.

Although the swimming team
lost by only 11 points and won
seconds and thirds in many races.
coach Grady pointed out that the
ﬁnal score doesn't always indi-
cate the actual strength of a
team. “Once a team maintains a
substantial lead and is assured

‘ of victory. it attempts to hide its

better swimmers from scouts that
may be present from other
schools,” he said.

“When you have that much tal-
ent and depth, you can do it,”
continued Grady, “but when you
don’t, you must use what you
have and be thankful for it.”

Having lost to Ohio U. and
beaten Syracuse, the swimmers

They lost the lead with 17 min-

the score 59-58 in favor of the
Panthers.

“Larry Szykowny played the
best offensive and defensive game
for us,” said 'I‘immons. Szykowny

special

Fifteen years ago, our
Company pioneered the
idea of an internship
program for college
students interested in
life insurance careers.
Time has proved
itsworth.

Our campus agents are
trained while they're
still at school, given a
chance to make a proper
career decision before
graduation. 37°/o of
those participating in
this program in the last ‘
10 years are currently
enjoying successful
careers with the
Company in sales,
supervisory, and
management spots. 22°/o
of the Company's 50

top agents began their
insurance careers while
college students.

We think our campus
internship program is
pretty special—so do
others. We'd be glad to
tell you more about it.

Ths American Road. Dsarborn, Michigan

What does it take to “spark” a man to his very
best . . . to bring out the fullest expression of his
ability and training? At Ford Motor Company
we are convinced that an invigorating business
and professional climate is one essential. A prime
ingredient of this climate is the stimulation that
comes from working with the top people in a
ﬁeld . . . such as Dr. James Mercereau.

Jim Mercereau joined our Scientiﬁc Laboratory
in 1962. Recently, he headed a team of physicists
who veriﬁed aspects of the Quantum Theory by
creating a giant, observable quantum effect in
superconductors. This outstanding achievement
was the major reason the U. S. Junior Chamber of Commerce selected
Dr. Mercereau as one of “America’s Ten Outstanding Young Men of 1964.”
Your area of interest may be far different from’Dr. Mercereau’s; however,
you will come in contact with outstanding men in all ﬁelds at Ford
Motor Company. ‘ .

We believe the coupling of top experience and talent with youth and
enthusiasm is stimulating to all concerned. College graduates who join
Ford Motor Company ﬁnd themselves very much a part" of this kind of
team. If you are interested in a career that provides the stimulation of
working with the best, see our representative when he visits your campus.
We think you'll be impressed by the things he can tell you about Working
