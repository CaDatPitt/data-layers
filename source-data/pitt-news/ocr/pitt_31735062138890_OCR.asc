‘Athletic Committee to Decide
on Coach for “Next Year; '
Interest Intense

 

There will be a lively discussion

dver the matter of a footballtcoach .

for next season at the Dectmber
meeting of the Athletic Committee to
be held next Wednesday. It is said
that the committee is divided on the
question of whether or not “Joe”
Thompson should be retained, one
faction standing by. the present coach
for re-election and the other clamor-
ing for the election of,a new man.
Members of the committee had little
to say when approached on the sub-
ject. ,

It is iunderstooclthat Thompsorf is
anxious to have one more yearas
head coach of the football team. He
is said to have admitted that he made
some bad mistakes this (year in the
matter of coaching the team, but
claims that, ’ if given one more
chance, he will prove to the satisfac-
tion of all that he is still capable of
producing a winnin.g ,team.

The student body is divide-d into E
the same two -factions as "the Athletic I

Committee. One‘ set insists that, re-
gardless of the past record of »'I‘homp-

son as Pitt’s coach,_it is time for him

His Time; Vacancy to
be Filled Soon

At the last meeting of the Athletic
Committee, Graduate Manager L. B.
Hurst announced that he would not
be a candidate for re-election on De-
cember 14, when the annual election
for graduate manager will be held
The announcement did riot come as
a very great surpriseto the members
of the committee, as Mr. Hurst was
dubious about accepting the ‘honor
for the past yearﬁowing to the great
amount of time which the position
demanded nd to the fact that his law
practice vtgs growing greatly in size.
H3"’has been so busy this year at
something -must be given up, so he
wiselydecided to stick to his law

Important Resolution

 

Deﬁnite action was taken at a re-
cent meeting of the Advisory Board
on Student Activities to conﬁne the
soliciting of all advertising for stu-
dent activities, programs or otherwise,
to students "of the University. This
is perhaps, the most important action
yet taken by this board since its or-
ganization under the authority of the
trustees last spring. The action.ap-

plies to“the athletic program as well A

as all other student activities.

It has been pointed‘ out that a great‘ A

amount of injury has been inﬂictedi
upon the University as well as upon,

the various organizations by profes-
sional advertising solicitors. These
men have in many cases misrepre-
sented the University in such ways as
to cause many inﬂuential men to be-

come unfriendly to the institution. In A

away with this
harm, practical experience in solicit-
ing will be given to the student as
wellﬂas a means ‘for earning money.

At a recent meeting‘ of the Stu-
dents’ "Activity Committee" of the
University there came to‘light the
fact that the 1913 Owl had 'a deﬁcit
of over $600, and that.there was small
hope.of reducing that deﬁcit to any
extent without resorting to an assess-
ment on every member of the present
senior class of the_ University.'_ The
suggested that such a

'the University, This ‘aétion on the
part of the committee is',"pr'aiseworthy
and _it is altogether likely that the
plan suggested will be carried out.
The Owl,is a class publication and

T the classiought to be held responsible

for all the debts that were incurred

should -be sufficient class spirit and

pride to clear the records of all debt.
Now, just a‘ word about the 1914

Owl. To date,- as far as can be

"le'arn,ed from reliable sources,’ there

has been little accomplished by the
‘members of the board that will have
charge of the work of putting out the
Owl for the present-year. In fact,
the board‘ has not as yet been com-
pletely organized, let alone the matter
of having planned a deﬁnite campaign.
-In many respects» t'his unwarranted,
delay maybe detrimental to the suc-
cess of the book. Last year the mat-
-teriof getting down to hard work on
the Owl was put off until a late date
and the eEect,.on the publication was
marked, indeed.’ To make a publica-
tion of thenature of the Owl suc-
cessful, much time and labor us_t ‘be
devoted to the Work by the members
of_the board. It cannot be put out
in a day. Mor-eover’, if the book is
not going to be the best, that it ‘can
possibly-be, both from the literary
and ﬁnancial standpoints, but is going
to be unable to. n1eet_its ‘expenses,
W‘hy put out an Owl? _ 1 '

It is a certainty that it is possible
to put out an Owl that would pay for
itself and whose style would be ex-
cellent. But this can not be done if
work is not started soon. Let every
member of the Owl staff and of the
Junior class, also, see that some deﬁ-
nite actjon is taken at once. _ '

A wildly excited crowd of Over

to the tune of 38-0 and praises were
heard for both teams after the game
was~'over; State for their splendid all-
round playing and ‘Pitt for,the won-
derfulﬁght they put‘ up when out-

was almost perfect from a spectator’s

~ FOOTBALL SELECTION

 

The Sporting E‘clitor'ihas seen the
following teams perform this season:
Yale, Princeton, Navy,»Penn State,

nelland Pittsburgh. Followingis the
teamawhich he has selected without
favoritism:

FIRST TEAM.

Fullback, Mauthe, Penn State.

I-Ialf, Thorpe, Carlisle Indians.

Half, Baker,’ Princeton,

Quarter, Miller, Penn State.

End,’ Bomeisler, Yale-

Tackle, Engle, Penn”State.

Guard, Brown, Navy.

Center, Galvin, Pittsburgh.

Guard, ‘Logan, Princeton.

Ta'ckle, Phillips, Princeton.

End, Gilchrist, ‘Navy.

- * SECOND TEAM.
Fullback,“ Eichenlaub, Notre Dame.
I-Ialf, Arcasa, Carlisle.

Half, Fleming, W. & I.

«Quarter, Welch, Carlisle.
Enid, Very, Penn State.
Tackle, A Jones, Notre -Dame.
Guard, Smith or Le"ahy, Pitt.
Center, Ketcham, Yale’.
Guard, Cooney, Yale. .
Tackle, Schwab, W. & J.
End, Wagner, Pittsburgh.

In comparing the work of Galvin of
‘Pittsburgh. and Ketcham, the captain-
elect of Yale,-I believe that the for-
mer is a better all-round player than
the Eastern star. Galvin standsover
six feet in height, weighs about 235
and is. as fast as any big man I ever
saw. In his four years of football at
Pittsburgh, the center of'the line has
been a stone wall and not a single,
opponent has made a gain worthy of
mention. Besigles ‘his great work as
a defensive center, he diagnoses a
play quickly andioften drops back to
break up a forward pass or end run.
He possesses‘ enough speed and ag-
gressiveness to be used in the back-
ﬁeld in a pinch and was very success-
ful‘ in line.plungi‘ng and running the
ends in the State game. His punting
has been a decided factor in every
game that Pitt has -played in the past
four years, and I believe that if an
average of~his punts were made, that

it would be between 45 and 48 yards. .

Ketcham plays a great defensive
_game, but coﬂd not be used in the
backﬁeld to carry the ball or to punt
as he does not possess the speed.
Mauthe and Miller of Penn State
are as good men at their respective
positions as I have ever seen. They
lodced much better than any of the
backs on either the Yale or Princeton.
teams at every angle of the game. I

believe State would defeat either of -

these -big teams by two ‘touchdowns

as they possess a superior. offense and

an almost equal defense. . g I ‘

WEEKEY 

 

WAGNER WILL LEAD
THE 1913 TEAM

 

At an election held at the Schenley
before the annual football banquet
given the team by the Athletic Com-
mittee, “Hube” Wagner was elected

to captain the‘ 1913 footballgteani.
“Hube” has always been a great ~v
favorite with the players and his

choice is 21 popular one- He came into
the limelight in the 1910 State game
when he grabbed a State forward
pass and crossed their line for "a
touchdown and has been considered
a star ever since, He played ‘end the

 ﬁrst two years, but Coac'h Joe Thomp-
' son placed him back of the line this

year to strengthen the backﬁeld, as
Pitt had no seasoned material for
either half or full. He is a good
ground gainer and his only trouble is
that he worries the quarterbacks with
suggestions of what plays should be
used in the game. While this is
caused by his anxiety to win, it‘is a
decided fault which he must overcome
next year.

In his speech of acceptance “Hube”

praised Capt. Galvin and saidithat he
hoped to lead’Pitt to a victoriouﬂs ﬁn-
ish in 1913. He has but one more
year of foptball before him.. "Wagner
is studying medicine and is-one of the
"brightest and most popular men in his
class. in W" . t .

ent.

All» girls .who loan

self. Baker is a good man in all de-
partments, but Arcasa is just about
his equal. .

Bomeisler is a very heavy and fast
end who easily outclasses any other
I have " seen, this year. Princeton
found it -impossible to circle his end
and were not very successful"in re-
turning punts, ‘due to his speed~and
tackling. Gilchrist, the Navy star, is
a good running mate for Bomeisler,
although not. as‘ heavy by about 25
pounds. He is fast in covering punts
and handles the forward pass well.

Engle of State is the best man they
have‘ in their line and his size and ag-

gressiveness make him a very valu- .

able player. ‘He stopped many plays
directed at guard and center this sea-
son. Phi.llips of Princeton played a
great defensive game against Yale.-
Brown is another lineman who is
good at booting-the ball as he showed
in the Army-Navy game this year. “He
is a big fellow and used his ‘head a
lot in playing. Logan of Princeton
is a valuable defensive.player.

WAGNER "P ELECTED CAPTAIN‘

 

 

The bruised and tired warriors as-
semble.d at’ the Schenley
Pitt-State contest to attend the an-
nual banquet given in their honor by
the Athletic Committee. Before the
’Varsity men went "to the banquet
hall, they met for the election of the
1913 captain. The result showed that
“Hube” Wagner, Pitt’s star end and

fullback, had received the'honor and

a hearty cheer was given the _new
captain who will succeed “Polly”
Galvin. ' . _ d '

The banquet vﬁs a huge success all
the way from —the~ blue points and
turkey to dessert, and about twenty
Gold and Blue players enjoyed their
ﬁrst smokesinceulast August. The

Pitt band was tired “from the after- ‘
noo'n’s work at the game, but, despite" J ,

this, rendered some classy select-ions
between_ times. i .
Afte allhad ﬁnished the last course

»ar_;d th room was comfortably full of

smoke. Toastmaster’ Judd, the
President of the Athletic Committee,
made a short speech, in which‘ he
praised the great ﬁghtivput up by the

players this year against great odds. ‘

He then introduced Chancellor Mc-
Cormick, w‘h0 thanked the menffor,
their loyalty and courage in uphold-
ing the honor of the University on
the gridiron.’ Well-known alumni, the
coaches, and othersprominent, in Pitt
athletics made short talks,
keynote of all seemed» to be .“Wait
’Till Next Year.” ‘ ‘

VVhen the coming yeariwas. "men-’
tioned, theitrend of the talk seemed

to favor “Joe” Thompson as coach of .

the 1913 team. The past season, was-
one of the worst that a Pitt football
team has ever passed, but it is unfair
to blame the coach entirely for their.
numerous defeats. It seemed to be
the opinion of all that the coaching
was partly to blame’, but “Joe”~ worked
severe handicaps,
namely: Raw material, -injuries to the.
members of the Varsity, sickness, vac-
cination, and bad breaks in luck. He
should be given, another chance on
his past record, which is a splendid,
one. _

Mr. A. R. Hamilton announced_that
he ha-d made arrangements for next.
year’s squad to start practice and
spend the entire month of September

(Continued from Page 6)

imuch praise from the spectators as

the victors.

"State scoired early in the ﬁrst quar-
ter when Mauthe kicked a ﬁeld goal
from midﬁeld. The ﬁrst touchdown
came in the second quarter and it was
Mauthe who was responsible for the

_score as he carried the ball most of

the distance on line bucks off tackle.
The second touchdown came in the
same quarter and resulted from a Pitt
fumble which gave State the ball on
the Gold and Blue 35-yard line. State
advanced" slowly and steadily toward
the Pitt fg-oal despite a stubborn de-
fense and after three tries at the line
had failed, Mauthe managed to carry
the leather across. The ﬁrst ‘half
ended 17-0 in State’s favor. Pitt’s
opponents got two more touchdowns
in easy style in the third period. Two
forward passes from Mauthe to Very

gained 60 yards and 7 points and

Berryman took one of Wagner’s
passes over Pitt’s line after a 50-yard"

.i dash. The last score came as the re-

sult of another forward pass from
Mauthe to Very which gained“ 60
yards and a short end run by Miller
for the rest of the distance.

Pitt had several good chances to
score, but failed to make good. Early
in the third quarter, Shof hit the line
for a 40-yard gain, being stopped by
Miller on State’s 20-yard line. He
fumbled and Very picked‘ up the bal.l
and started toward the Pitt goal, but
before he had gone more than a few
feet, Galvin, Smith and Wagner hit
him at once and carriedihim 25 yards
and over the State goal line. This
looked very much like a Pitt score
as the ball had not stopped moving
long enough to be a “down” but the
ofﬁcials 'i'uled otherwise and gave State
theﬁball on their own 25-yard line.

‘ '. eWit‘h the -ball on their own 25-yard

line, Wagner hit the line for a 45-yard
gain, placing the leather on State’s
15-yard line. Two tries placed the
ball on State’s 8-yard line, but State
recovered a forward pass agd it was
all off ‘for Pitt. This was. not very
good generalship on Pitt’s part, for
the opponents were waiting for this
play andthe line plunges were gain-
ing steadily. Dillon signaled for a
fair catch on State’s 48-yard line and
Galvin tried a ﬁeld goal which fell
short.

In the f urth quarter Pitt marched
the length of the ﬁeld and a touch-
down seemed” almost sure, but State
ﬁnally stopped the desperate Pitt men
on the 10-yard line ‘and the last chance
was gone. Taking the ball on Pitt's
20-yard line, Galvin made 3 through
the line. Wagner ran around State’s
left end for_a 20-yard gain. Miller
stopping him after he had passed the
rest of the ﬁeld. Shof hit, center for
8 and after he had failed to gain on
the second try at the same place Capt.
Galvin made it ﬁrst down on State’s
40-yard line on a line buck. Dillon hit
tackle for 3 yards and Slhof added 2
more at center. Wagner carried the
ball to the 30-yard line on the next
try and a 5-yard penalty put the

leather on the 25-yard mark. Galvin
hit the line for 5 and Shof made a
ﬁrst down on State’s 15-yard line.

but three yards were gained on the

GRADUATE MANAGER HORST
RE_TIRES FROM ATHLETICS

(Continued from Page 1) ,

When Manager Hurst‘ took the
reins from Prof. Silverman of the
Chemistry department in 1909, affaiprs.
were not in very good’ shape, as the
committee was deeply ‘in debt, and
their credit was not very good. ‘This
state of affairs was not due in any re-
spect to negligence of Prof. Silver-
man,'i as he -‘had taken his office when
athletics at the University were in
absolute chaos and had worked dili-
gently and with praiseworthy success
to set matters on a "strong ﬁnancial
basis. He was unable to remain in
the game long enough to accomplish
his object, so his successor found
many obstacles in the road andhad
much to discourage him.

a victorious trip to the championship.

Another well—known‘ alumnus pro-
posed that the Pitt band’ be given uni-
forms next season so that their looks
as well» as their_ music would surpass
Pitt's opponents, and this met with
hearty approval. Several uniforms
were promised by other alumni right
away, so that the band now has a
great start for A1913.

The meeting ended with a ﬁne
speech -by Shapira. His imitation of
a Dutchman was surprisingly good,

employed when railroads ﬁrst came 9

into existence.

SPEAKS ON FRENCH PEOPLE

Mr. Eujene Tournier gave a very
interesting address on the French

GRADUATE MANAGER HURST ‘
‘ RETIRES FROM ATHLETICS

U

her footbaﬁpgames at Old Expo Park
in Allegheny, but in the fall of that

year, Manager Hurst _ made an ar- ‘

rangement with Barney Dreyfuss of
the Pittsburgh Baseball Club, by
which Pitt used’ Forbes Field, the
great million dollar steel and concrete
structure, for both practice and games.
This was a long step in advance, for
games into
great games, attracting thousands of
people an_d added wonderfully to the
interest of Pittsburgh and the outside
world in Pitt. This arrangement
moved the contests from a ﬁeld with
miserable seating facilitiesand in a
neighborhood almost inaccessible to
the patrons of the game, to a wonder-
ful gridiron. with the most improved
facilities for handling large crowds
and in acentral location. The result
wasalmost astounding, as immense
cnt’husi.asm"was aroused in Pittsburgh
and its environs for Pitt games. Aided
byigood teams and loyal press back-
ing, Pitt’s _games are becoming more
and more important, and we have now
become" more than a mere dot on the
football map. The total attendance

years ago was not much over 200,
While at the same contest this year
nearly 16.000 cheered the rival teams.
The total attendance at Forbes Field
for 1912 will approximate 45,000.

The ticket system at old Expo Park‘
was very crude and the crowds were
of such a‘small size that they were
easy to handle, but Manager Hurst
found conditions very different at
Forbes Field. Instead of one price
for admission being paid, there were»
three prices at Forbes.Field, general
admission, ‘reserved seats and box
seats, with acdiﬁerent scale of prices
for large and small games. This
caused great diﬂiculty until he worked
out a system which facilitated matters.
The large payroll gave considerable
trouble at ﬁrst, but Manager lHurst
had pay checks printed, which
signed by him, stamped with e

.WEEKLY "
tion and given tothe man as soon as
he was placed". at his post. After the
game, the holder of the pay check
had to endorse it before receiving his
daﬁ pay. This gave an absolute
check on the wages paid out and left
no loophole for a ‘possible grafter.

In 1909 Manager Hurst installed the
advance mail order system, which
added greatly to the’. advance sale of
seats and_ also gave the alumni and
students the preference of grand-
stand seats forthe‘ big games. The
new system gave considerable annoy-
ance at First, but this season a plan
was devised to overcome the former
obstacles. A series of four cards of
different colors (representing each of
the four games) was sent to each
alumni in Western Pennsylvania.
Each card had to be ﬁlled in with the
name, class, etc., of the sender, and
if a certiﬁed‘ check or money ,,order
did not accompany the order, no at-
tention was given it. A ﬁling system
kept the date of the order, and when
it was ﬁlled and sent, and also a rec;
0rd of the seats sent.

During his regime, Manager Hurst
has arranged games with such teams
as Navy, Cornell‘, Notre Dame,
Georgetown, Carlisle and others,-be-
sides the annual games with Penn
State and VV. & J. He has not spared
himself nor his interests in working
to place Pitt at the top» of the athletic
ladder, and his splendid work as ath-
letic leader will long be remembered
by all who are interested in Pitt ath-
letics. Many of our loyal supporters
have given more in a ﬁnancial way
to Rittithan Manager Hurst, but no
one deserves more praise than our

‘graduate manager, whose personal at-

tention and untiring energy has sup-
plied something to the University
which cannot be purchased.

The committee has a splendidfman
in view to succeed Manager Hurst.
He is a graduate of the University
who has been in close connection with
Pitt athletics forthe past ﬁve years
and Who will be a splendid man for

the position. Itiis hoped that he will:

be elected at the "next meeting of the
committee and will ﬁnd it possible to
accept the honor. *» ‘
