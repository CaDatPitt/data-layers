“Just _Yo‘u“and'Me"‘
Title of Production
W’ritten by Bowers

“Just You and Me," a one
act play written and directed

 Bill Bowers, Arts senior,

will be presented next Friday
at 8 p.m. in the Social Room
of the Stephen Foster Memor-
ial. There will be no ‘charge for
admission.
, Bowers explained that the Pitt
Players project of giving students
the opportunity of experiencing
playwriting, directing, producing
and other aspects of theater work
has been‘ considered for a long
time.

His play was written for Dr.
Ralph Allen's playwriting course.-
It is concerned with a conﬂict be-
tween two older women for the
love of the one’s' daughter. This
conflict arises when a man re-
turns an item to their gift shop
for credit.

Student Production

The students participating in
the play ‘are: Linda Lee, Lola
Matta, Judy Stoner, and Paul
Kanfer . ,

' Copies of the original draft
of.Bower’s play will be passed
out to the audience before the
show starts. The play, which
was revised by Bowers during
rehearsal, will. be followed by
a question and answer period.

“In, the 10 days of rehearsal,”
Bowers said, “I have learned more
about playwriting than I have in
twoyears of actual writing. « '

Major Changed

Bowers, who transferred‘ from
the Ohio State School of Engi-
neering~.two years ago, changed
his major to speech at the Uni-
versity. He acted in “Papa is
All” this past summer, in the
Theater “11’s “All My Sons" last
winter, andin “Pajama Game.”

The ‘part of Hines, the knife-
throweri in‘ Pajama ‘Game, won
him the actor of the‘ year award.
He also worked? in summer stock
in the summer of 1958. '

'Graduating in April, Bowers
hopes to work in the ﬁeld of pub-
lic relations or television. Re-

W7riter’s Talk
Offers Advice
To Aspirants

B)’ PAT CHERKIN

“Reread,” “rewrite.” “write
every day," and “write only
that which you know," was
the advice given young writ-
ers at the annual VVriter‘s
Conference here last week.

Participating in the panel dis-
cussion were Andrew Bernhard,

ieditor of the Pittsburgh Post-

Gazette; Elizabeth Yates, promi-
nent author of novels, biographies,
and children‘s literature:
. Peter Beagle. recent University
“graduate and author of “A Fine
and Private Place"; Dr. Edwin
Peterson. professor and author of
‘l‘Penn’s Woods West": and l{ath—
erine Anne Porter. foremost
American slio1‘t—sto1‘y \\'x‘itc-I‘.
Writer Must Read
"Learn to road —- read. think
over. and an:tly7.e.“ Bernhard told
the Standing Room Only crowd.
“It is extrerncl_\' important to re-
read and rewrite.” he said.
Miss Yates reminded the audi-
ence, “You can't dream your-
self into being a writer, but
rather you must forge ahead."
Her second suggestion was.
“There is something you know
more about than anyone else--
write that.” _
Peter Beagle recommended. “Do
things you aren't particularly in-
terested in. You should know
something about something so
that you aren’t one of these writ-
ers who are spinning: off their per-
sonalities.“ he said.
Know Words
“Writers should be in love with
words," statecl Peterson. “There-
fore,” he continued. "You should
be able to spell the names of your
lovers -— you should recognize. a
comma when you see her on the
street, and up your hat. to her.”
He described the writers job as
being able to “dispel
from Chaos."

' A survey of almost l200_ edu-
cational institutions shows that
41 per cent of the total amount
of money. spent by a studentin
one year comes from his family;
29 per cent from his savings; 17
per cent from his earnings after
school; 5 per cent from the GI

Unlikevlpolice units of the
twentieth century, ours has a
system so -inadequate that a
switch to carrier‘ pigeons would
improve communications by at
least 300 per cent. .-
Let me put this in perspective. ' . A
Our security ‘force is composed“ of 2 eighteen

uniformed men under the direction of Captain Rayf

whose otﬁce is located on the ground floor of the

V Cathedral. As\a whole, they are helpful and cour-

teous gentlemen. , \

Broken into shifts that operate 24 hours a day,
these vetefan policemen keep the peace by pro-
viding three kinds of protection. Some are sta-
tioned in certain buildings (sometimes » in plain
clothes). Some patrol the campus. And others
check out the buildings.

Not Much To Speak Of "0 ’

The only real equipment we furnish them with
is a jeep, 5 ’51 Chevrolet sedan, and a first aid kit
(a stretcher and gas mask are kept in ‘the Security
Dept. otiice which is locked after 5 p.m.).

Although the members‘ of our police force takes ‘

orders from the university, through Captain Ray

, (not from the city police department), they _must

keep order. When sworn in, they acquire the same
authority as constables. With, a jurisdiction ex-
tending throughout Allegheny County, they en-
force city ordinances, the Pennsylvania criminal
code, and university regulations;

They take their arrests to police station number
four here in Oakland. ‘

It is here that Pitt’s communications system
comes in, if it be called a system.- It consists of a
central operator and the university telephone net-
work. No more. The operator keeps in touchwith
the various policemen as well as possible. From
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. an operator mans (“womans"

Made More Clear

Editor, The Pitt. News:

,In reply to Mr. Dapiel’s (Bus.
Adm. ‘62) criticism of the_Busi-
ness Administration elections,
we think a clariﬁcation should
be made concerning the topic he
discussed. or

In the first place, there was
confusion as»,ito who was author-
ized to run this particular elec-
tion.) This election should have
been under the direction of SG,
but they would. not hold the.
election until January. The past
members of H the ‘Cabinet ha d
planned seminars and activities
for the students this trimester;
therefore“necessitating the elec-
tion of officers in October.

‘ We were. under the miscon-
ception that a person had to
have an overall quality point‘
average of 2.5 and a 2.75 for the‘
previous semester in order 'to
run for a Cabinet office. After
looking into the’ Constitution/we
found that the only requirement
is an. overall 2.50: everage. _

‘ The men who check out the buildings call in
by phone from each building. They cannot be
contacted again by the operator until they call in
at another‘ place. _' “ ’

Those who patrol the’campus—proper have evfm
less contact with the operator. Every half hour --
they stop and have to enter a building in order to
call in. The operator cannot talk with him again»
for another half hour.

.Men Are_:l‘Not Integrated. ‘L 0 ‘ 

It’s plain to see that except for certain informal
arrangements made by’the policemen themselves,
each man isvvirtually isolated from the others, as
well as from the central operator. In such a situa-
tion, it is easy to see’what can happen unnecessarily.

Because our policemen’ wear essentially the
same uniformsas do the city police, they can be
easily mistaken for them. Imagine a situation
where a criminal is fleeing, across the campus to-
ward a university, policeman -who ;has had « no
chance to be warnedrqf his approach. A -

Unaware that the policeman is notiwaiting for

, him, the criminal sudd‘enly’sees, shoots. and it kills

him. Or he may"/hurt someone else nearby. In, _“’
another situation, the policeman may get» into I
trouble or have to chase a criminal. Without two-
way communications, each policeman must handle **
all situations alone and work without the assur-
lance that he is working as a part of a team. '

“What the police department needs is obvious — ,
some two-way radios. 3ecause of ‘certain’ FCC
regulations, the police cannot use shortwave radios
like those of the city police. But they’ can have _
“car to center” two-way radios that operate‘ on a
special band. And the control centers should have
radio receivers to monitor regular police calls.

The $600.00’ Question . I ,

Here’s what they need: a monitor in the ,cap- A
‘.ain’s.of’fice, and in Salk Hall‘; and a two-way 
radio in ‘the ofﬁce, Salk Hall, the jeep,=and the
police car. Pitt could buy all six radio sets in kit .4-
form from any number'of sources for no more
than $600.00" The police department knows how to
assemble themand is willing to do so. \

With such communications equipment,_ the uni-
versity police will be able to protect our safety,
property and health more adequately. They will
be safer themselves. , .;

I’m‘ sure-we will get around to spending the
$600.00 to get thisequipment. But‘ will we have to‘
wait until someone gets hurt first? i‘

As a graduate of Pitt (1960)
I,’ vividly remember the tremen-
dous rallies and marches we.

Latin American Situation Examind
“The prestige-of tiiye Il{;l"1'ftI:§ Sltéftfsﬂin Latin America was

not very good under the Democrats and it is worse now,” re- , _
ieconomy, Landy feels, since Cuba

ports Sy Landy, graduate assistant‘ in the History Depart-

ment. Landy spent some tim

e this past summer in Cuba,

studying the political and economic situation.

There is penetration into virtually every Latin American
country by the U.S. and do-or-dieo ’

attempts to maintain the status
quo. Consequently, Landy says, it
has been a general U.S. policy to
support dictators in Latin Amer-
ica.

However, according to Landy,

“the forces in Latin America to‘

uphold the status quo are growing
weaker.” The U.S. is being pres-
sured by peoples’ movements,
such as the July 26 movement in
Cuba.

Before the revolution, Cuban
economy mirrored ' American in-
terests rather than the economic
needs of the Cuban people. By

Landy’s observation, most of the?

land was farmed in sugar and to-
bacco for American export. Little
foodstuffs were raised, and most
of Cuban food was imported.

Land Abused

A piece of land planted in
American sugar would lie fallow
and unproductive after the soil
was exhausted, worthless to
Cubans because it was owned by
Americans.

In his study of the industry,
Land noticed that only the peri-
pherywas owned by Cuban in-
terests. “There was no indenti-
ﬁcation of the people with the
land they worked, no folk cul-
ture, and even souveniers for
sale to tourists were imported.”

Then came the 26th of July
Movement and Fidel Castro. Ac-
cording to Landy, the Revolution
was not widely participated in al-
though it was popularly support-
ed. The Batista regime, influenc-
ed and supported by the U.S.,
found itself too shaky, to resist
the small percentage of Cubans
who comprised the “Fidelistas.”

The immediate problem after
the revolution was one of econo-
mic reform. “To gain capital with-
out being a puppet state, Cuba
had to use the resources at her
command—-manpower, A superior
agriculture had to be developed
quickly,” Landy stated.

Communes Attract

Thus Cuban peasants, fervent-
ly nationalistic for the first time
in their history, were attracted to
cooperative agriculture -—— com-
munes. Each peasant now takes a
voluntary 4% off the top of his
salary for government industriali-
zation.

According to Landy, “Cuba is
able to do easily what every Latin
American country does by force.
Cuba is able to freeze wages_vo1-

.threat of American intervention.”
;“Cuba or death” and other anti-
:American slogans are far more

l

‘numerous in Cuba than “Beat ’em,

,Bucs” signs in Pittsburgh during-

ﬁthe Series.
3 “If you pick up a phone in
§ Cuba you don’tget a dial-tone,"
% reports Landy. “You get an
 anti-U.S. slogan."
l Besides receiving 70 new fac-
itories next year from Russia, Red
;China_. East Germany, and Japan,
§Cuba is tapping new sources of
iindustry. The Castro regime is
liteaching Cubans to eat what they
themselves can raise, thus chang-
ing the U.S.-oriented
habits of generations.
The people themselves are very
much involved in co-ops and in
their economy. Landy stated that
Cuba is not absolutely pro-Com-
munist or anti-Communist. It is
a regime “in transition," able to
totter either way.
“There are, however,
tendencies toward social struc-

tures similar to that of both Rus-
sia and Red China. The major
cause for communistic leanings,
he feels, is the American State
Department’s policy t 0 W a r d
Cuba."

cultural

U.S. Recruits
“The best recruiting sergeant
for Communism in Cuba,” Landy
says, “is the U.S. State Depart-
ment.” The people have consoli-
dated into one party, the 26th of
July Movement. If this fails,
Landy feels that the Communists

are prepared to succeed.

There are, in Cuba, no indica-
tions of democratic processes.
If in the future the regime must
gain more than a 4% surplus
from the people, or if the “Fi-
del-worship” of the people
wears off, Landy believes that
lack of any democratic patterns

Can3Cats Stand
Prosipe,rity;,Army
State Will Tell -

‘By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

Can the Panthers stand prosperity? That is the question __

’that will be answered in the next two football weekends as
the rejuvenated Cats take on powerful Army and upset-mind-
ed Penn State. " l ‘

After‘ a slow start (nowins in their ﬁrst‘ three ball garnes)

° ll Coach John Michelosen’s Panthers began -to look like 'the*
El‘ team that the pre-season rating said they would be. '

V»/ins over Miami and West Virginia gave the locals hope
for a successful season. They looked ahead to Pitt’s meeting
with mighty Syracuse. While they were looking ahead TCU

*(a ‘good football team) held the Blue and Gold to their sec- ‘
 ond deadlock of the season. i ‘ - . ' V .

a

But‘ still they" could look ahead to1Slyracuse.. They

if  T ’ didn’t have to look far for the Orange turned out to be

a little behind ‘the Pitts. -About ten big points.
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.

About the only thing anybody could say about the Irish

up to this time was that they were ﬁghting. Not winning any

i ball games, just ﬁghting. Well, they foughtthe Panthers._ As

 a matter of record they fought the Panthersharder than

1" any previous Cat opponent had done. But as. in the recent
past, the best the Irish could do was ﬁght.

Now“ let’s look into our crystal ball and see what is in
store for Michelson’s ball club. Army-Penn State, again two
good football teams. 2

The general feelingabout the Cadets is that the ‘Pan-
‘' thers should win without too much difficulty. We dis- »
agree. Army will .be remembering two years ago _When
they came into the Smokey City with a Perfect record
and the number one team in the nation. They were lucky
, to.en_ierge from the smoke with a 14-14 tie, no longer in ,
 the coveted position of leaders.

V‘ r Army beat Syracuse last week. Not as convincing as Pitt
but they did score more points than the Orange. This will
give them added incentive. The Pitts cannot afford a let-
down. And with a 4-2-2 record there should be none.

. - - '4:
, Penn State next. But as Michelosen will say, lets take
one at a time.” Did we hear someone mention bowl bids‘? For-
get it. Army and Penn State won’t.
=1: :1: * * * _ . *
Three weeks ago, a story appeared in the Pitt News about
John Yaccino. It appeared in Monday’s edition but was writ-
ten on Thursday because ofthe pape_r’s deadline. That week-
end Pitt was playing TCU and Yacc_1no scored the Panthers
only TD.

The following week Ed Sharockman was the sub3ect of

the story and he, like Yaccinohplayed a tremendous football

V game on the weekend his story appeared. Last week Chuck

Reinhold received the magic story. You guessed it, Reinhold

scored the winning touchdown for Pitt. Next week keep your
eyes on Ron Delﬁne. . .

goes into the huddle, will con-
tinue to split out wide‘ and ‘play

/ Greatest Thrill
Came in Notre

Dame Game. a
When calling signals over
center, ex-Panther quarter-
back Bill Kaliden never guid-
edlhis team to an undefeated
season. But as an assistant.
coach, barking signals from
the sideline, he was a potent force
in the yearling’s 5-0 record.

In 1958, during Kaliden’s senior
year, he~.was instrumental in lead-
ingvmany late period surges.

But his brightest moment was
his. game twinning score against
Notre Dame.‘With 11 seconds re-
maining, fourth down and goal-
tfo-go on the Irish ﬁve yard line,
Kaliden raeed ﬁve yards for the
TD.

Greatest Thrill , .

“It was the greatest thrill of
my career,” Kaliden said. ‘‘I knew
right away what I was going to
do.”

Kaliden didn’t depend on his
performances on the gridiron to
achieve recognition at the Uni-
versity. A Phi Beta Kappa grad-
uate with a 3.74 Q.P.A. he re-
ceived the Athletic Committee
Award given annually to the
athlete who has shown scholar-
ship, athletic achievement,

, sportsmanship and aptitude.

He maintained a B-plus aver-
age, and was holding a 94% aver-
age in Dental School when he
decided to forsake a medical ca-
reer to coach football.

‘ Not Happy

“I was not happy in what I was

doing, so I decided that I was cut

out to be a coach,” said Kaliden.
“I really enjoy working with the
boys.” _ ,_

Head Coach Lou “Bimbo”

Cecconi is well satisﬁed with
Kaliden. “The kids have come
along with him and he brings
out desire in them,” he said.
“He sets a good example as a
clean-living model athlete.”

“He has the interest and desire’
to become a good coach. He cer-
tainly isn’t going into it for the
money angle.”

’ Michelosen Comments

Head varsity Coach John Mich-
elosen echoed the same sentiment.
“He was a ‘real ﬁne player. One
thing I have always felt is that he
went through his collegiate career
a little too quickly. If he wants
to follow the coaching game, I
think he has a real ﬁne future.”

   
 
   

   

Concerning the Notre Dame
game Michelosen said. “I
thought at the time he was tak-
ing too long, but he certainly
had things under control.”

Backﬁeld mentor Vic Fusia
stated, “He was very coachable.
He had ﬁne powers of retention
which are essential to a good
quarterback. He was highly re-
spected by his teammates.”

E Players Praise

“Beano” Cook, publicity direc-
”tor, said, “They should have red-
shirted him. He only played 47
minutes "as a sophomore. If he
would, have played last year,‘ we
would have gone to a bowl.”

Kali’den’s locker is right next
to his ,players. Most of the

‘coaches dress in private quar-
ters across the way, but Bill is
right with the ‘boys. Rick Lee-
'so\n, frosh leading ground gainer,
claimed, “He, gets along well
with us. We’ll do anything for
him.” "
‘ Paul Martha, who had-aohand
in every one of the scores against
the Navy plebes, said, “He has
helped me a lot. He made the
transition from high school ball
to college ball much. easier for
me. He gets along with us because
he is young and is more like one
of the fellows.” ‘

Martha also credits him with
the Navy victory. “We were call-_,
ing bad plays and he told us at
half time to .call the plays on the
line. Those automatics were the
reason we won.” Q N;

Bill was not only a star,foot- /15
ball player. He was a star high
school basketball player and star-
red on the diamond for the Pan-
thers. He was a tremendous ath-
lete, a tremendous student with
agtremendous personality.

Rifle Team ’Host
Carnegie Tech

The Panther riﬂe team will host
the Carnegie Tech shooters .in a
return match this Friday at 7:30
in the evening at Zimmer Hall.
The building is located across from
Forbes Field on Sennot Street.

The Cats will "be entering the
contest with a 1-2 record follow-
ing a recent smash win "over Du-
quesne, 1344-1279.

Master Sgt. Ben Bostwick
commented, “We are more con-
ﬁdent now, and the team has
shown tremendous improve-
ment. I'm sure we will make a

them this time.”
Captain Karl Lober said, “We
are getting less nervous and we
will be better against them on our

own range.”

Head Coach Dale Hall
.,brings his Army Cadets into
the Stadium this Saturday,
.hoping to improve their ,,6-2
record. Army is also seeking 
revenge for the 1958 14-14 tie,‘ 

which ruined their perfect slate.

is 5-2-1, in favor of the Panthers.

The Cadets really reached a
peak last week in stopping Syra-
cuse 9-6, in a game in which they
had to be tough all the way to
protect a narrow lead.

The important position of quar-
terback has been expertly ﬁlled
by senior Torn Blanda. An expert
passer, Blanda has been Army’s
chiefioffensive weapon. He kicks
all the points after touchdowns

against Syracuse.

2 Hall this year has several de-
pendable backs. Junior full- -
back Al Rushatz has ﬁlled in
adequately for the injured Don
Bonko. At right half, injury-
prone Roger Zailskas seems to
have the inside track.

sophomore protege, Harry Stokes.
He commented, “He should be in
the ﬁrstﬁve without any diffic-
ulty. He could even challenge for
the lead if he just wants to go all
out.”

Last year the trailblazers ﬁn-
imshed an undistinguished 19th in
a ﬁeld of 25 teams as Michigan
State copped the meet‘ crown for
the second consecutive year. Ron
Rush, top Panther thinclad, ﬁn-
ished the highest in 22nd place.

Michigan State, which hum-

bled strong Penn State last

month, is again the leading con-
tender for the championship.

Stokes and Tarkany haven’t had
any previous experience in this

mad dash either. Clarke ﬁnished
1 88th last year and should im-

prove with the extra year of 1

seasoning. T

Stokes was second last week
against N.Y.U. and feels he has
beneﬁtted from the test. “It’s a
funny course,” Harry sighed,
“with a lot of flat territory at the
ﬁrst two miles. There were so

stepping on. I tried to avoid a

Rees is far more optimistic
about his freshman charges. They
have shown tremendous potential
in compiling a 4-1 record. They
have bested highly-touted Penn
State, Jeannette Harriers, West
Virginia and Georgetown. They
suffered a two point loss to the
Middies to mar their record.

In a ﬁeld of teams last year,

were nosed out of ﬁfth place by
the virtue of four points by
the Manhattan frosh, 164-160.
_Stokes ﬁnished‘seventh to pacer-

the Cat Cubs, but this time Bill
Mocnik is expected to gain the
laurels. Mocnik is undefeated this
season and will pose a top threat
for individual honors. The other
six men who will play a vital role
in the Little Panthers perform-
ance will be Steve Waslo, Larry
Robinson, Bob Henry, A. J. Rice,
Dick Cook and Bill Taylor.

::T o Clash in Powder Puff Bowl

 Female Foes Meet Friday at Forbes Field _
In Annual Gridiron Beneﬁt for Pitt Chest 

The walls are quaking in the girls’ domitories as the ten-
sion mounts for the crucial “Powder Puff Bowl” contest Fri-
day at 3:30 p.m. at Forbes Field between the Holland Hall
“Hell Cats” and the McCormick Hall “Untouchables.”

The feminine Panther counterparts of Mike Ditka and

Jim Cunningham have been

this bitter meeting. They have¢
‘Jihad two hour work outs daily,

despite rain and other inclement
weather. '

Their practice sessions have
produced bloody mouths, bloody
noses, stoved ﬁngers, sore muscles,
and tired, aching bodies. TWO
players have been lost for- the
“big” game. McCormick Hall lost
their flashy halfback Penny Jones
when someone stepped on her foot
at the Notre Dame game. She has
been laid up for 72 hours and

Injuries Mount
.4 One of Holland’s ace defensive
tackles, Helen Carpenter, fractur-
ed her arm while Indian wrestling
with a strong-armed teammate in
the dorms. These respective in-
—-j,ur»ies evened the hospital score.
During one practice, a girl
was dumped when “tackled.”
She got up slowly and kindly
asked to be excused and depart-
ed the scene hurriedly. It was
later disclosed that she had in-
curred a broken bra strap. Such
are the risks of female football.

Barbara Ossoff, the captain of
the McCormick “Untouchables”
claims, “We’re gonna give the
Hell Cats real hell.” Gerry Narky,
Holland’s captain yelled, “We’re
gonna smear them. In fact we’re
gonna cream them. We’re gonna
touch the “Untouchables.”

They have to be careful where
they apply their touch though.
A new rule was made for this
year’s game, stating that you
have to make the touch below
the waist. A

Coach Christoff echoed these
sad words: “Although coaching is
a rough life, it is all worth it in
the end. In the beginning, it is
a little discouraging to try to
teach ﬁfty giggling girls the fun-
damentals of football. But when
I see them starting to take shape,
football wise, that is, their co-
ordination improving, and their
enthusiasm ‘climbing to such
heights that it shakes the foun-
dations of the halls, I feel that it
is well worth the effort.” .

The girls will don their levis
and sweatshirts and head for
Forbes Field, where their game
is bound to rival the “Blood-
thirsty Bowl” for dirty action.

A nominal fee of 25 cents will
be charged. The proceeds will go
to the Pitt Chest.

They will hold a pep rally at
7:00 tomorrow night in the quad-
rangle for all those interested in
attending and giving the girls
some support.

H oopsters Drill For Opener

The varsity basketball team has had only four weeks of
practice and already their offense is jelling.

Coach Bob Timmons is enthusiastic about his chances for
the coming season. “We have more depth, speed, and overall
height than last year and we should greatly improve on last

season’s record of 11-14.

With six returning 1ettermen-‘-
from last year’s team and two
others that were in the service
Timmons has plenty of experi-
enced ball-players. Coming up
from the freshman team is Ben
Jinks who led the frosh in almost
every department last year. Also
returning is Howard Lockhart
who was ineligible the last tri-
mester of last year.

At the present time the start-
ing team consists of John Frid-
ley, Paul Lazor, Bob Sankey,
Dick Falenski and Jinks. They
all have great shooting abilities,

Fridley and Lazor being the big
men under the boards.

Thetscrimmage last night with
St. Vincent’s College and one on
Friday with the Cleveland Pipers

Cubs ‘All the Way’

By MARSHALL ROMEO
Coach Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi
still cannot believe that his team
has completed their season with-

out a loss. “This has been my
greatest thrill since my playing
days were over,” Cecconi said.
“I have read about and known
coaches who were undefeated but
I never thought it would happen
to me.”

Although Cecconi did not at-
tend the Navy or Kent State games
he left the team in capable hands
in the person of Bill Kaliden.
Kaliden, who along with Bob Pol-
lock and Joe Pullekines have as-

‘tion changes.

sisted Cecconi in grooming the
team for their varsity careers.

When asked to name the lead-

ing player Cecconi said, “It is
hard to name an outstanding
player because of the many posi-
A boy may not
come into his own until his junior
or senior years or a good fresh-
man may not plan out as expect-
ed.”

The Cubs breezed through
most of their games this year.
In the first three games the

scoring 11'! points. They beat

Smith Headed
For Yogi Title;
One Weeli Left

Jack (Scoop) Smith who
rested last week is now ready
for the stretch drive in the
yogi race. Scoop who has led
all season appears to be head-
ed for his ﬁrst championship.

His fans have adopted the motto,

“Scoop is going all the way.”
Fred Cox, who is representing

the players this week, has a job

ahead trying to catch Smith. Last

year the players won the title and
except for one poor week they
would be closer to him.

Joanne “Speedy” Dolinar is a
strong bet to win the third place
money on the basis of last week's
picks. She seems to have a large
enough lead on fourth place Mar-
shall Romeo to be almost sure of
her position.

Romeo is not living“ up to’
early season expectations.

Jim Vaughn, assistant coach of
the Pitt News Hawks, is this
week’s coaching representative.
Following him on the list of those
fallen by the wayside are Ted
Colton and Consensus both of
whom have already conceded.

Frosh and the Kent State Frosh
in those games.

The fourth game provided some
disappointment in that Penn State
crossed the goal line for the ﬁrst
TD against the Cats in ﬁve games.
Navy provided the stiffest opposi-
tion for the Cats taking a 16-0
first half lead. ~But they came
roaring back in the second half
scoring four TDs and winning
26-22. »
