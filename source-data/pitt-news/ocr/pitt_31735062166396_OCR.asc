Campaign

in the three-plank policy of

Political Parties Set
Platforms

By MURRAY CHASS
The subject of student government is highlighted on the
platforms of both the A1l—University Party and the All-Cam-
pus Party. In the All-University’s nine—point platform and

the All-Campus Party,sideas

relating to the problems of student government are presented.
The ﬁrst three planks of the AU platform state that that

candidates for office without re-
gard to social affiliation and sup-
porting students for governmental
positions based on issue; encour-
aging University-wide participa-
tion in student government and

party leaders; and appointing
committee chairmen in all phases
of student government on the ba-
sis of ‘merit and previous experi-
ence in these areas”.

In the preamble to _the AC plat-
frm, it is written, “Promotion of
high standards of student govern-
ment is our primary objective.”
Then, in the third item of the
platform they speak for the “elim-
ination of a duplicity in student
government, the purpose being to

' make the government bodies func-

tion more smoothly.”

Equipped Cafeteria
The All-Campus candidates also
propose “. . . better facilities and
prices in a true University book-
store, completion of the Cathe-
dral’s new library housed in a
separate building, and a cafeteria
equipped to serve comfortably a
large mass of students with inex-
pensive high quality food. . . .”
Informal leadership courses
that make modern group lead-
ership techniqu.-s available, co-
educational government in the
class ofﬁcer area, and a Uni-
versity radio program establish-
ed “upon recognition of such a
need” are other points that the
All-University Party is sup-
porting.
The election problem increased

party is in favor of: “supporting:

not participation as dictated by.

somewhat last Friday when it was
discovered that not all slated can-
didates had given their signed
consent to the respective parties.
However, the problem was ironed
out by the two party chiefs, Bob
Muzik (AU) and Larry Miller
(AC) and members of the Stuu

dent Elections Committee, and the I

candidates involved were given
until noon today to sign for them-
selves.—

The slate of the All-Campus

iParty for women’s Student Con-
gress positions and all class of-

ficer posts is as follows:

NBC Commentator
Talks at Convention

By BARBARA CIIERINGTON

“Women aren’t as mere as they used to be,” said little
Johnny when his father asked him how a mere woman got a

higher test score than he did.

\

This was part of a talk by Pauline Frederick, NBC com-
mentator, news analyst and guest speaker of the Intercol-
legiate Association of Women Students’ convention at Michi-

gan State University during theé

weekend of March '23.

‘ Miss Frederick developed the
idea in her talk that peace will
be obtained only after people
overcome three obstacles: the be-
lief that a truce armistice on
paper means perfect peace, the

_ belief that the Arab-Israel quar-

rels should be treated as an~iso-
lated disease, and the human fas-
cination with conﬂict. '
' Later Talk

“Don’t Shoot Mr. Smithers” was
the title of a later talk by Thomas
Hamilton, vice-president for Aca-
demic Affairs at MSU. Dr. Ham-
ilton presented the situation of a
Phi Beta Kappa girl-graduate who
wonders after several years of
married life and motherhood what
value her‘ college education is.

He suggested that education’s
end is not necessarily professional
competence but a “means to ar-
rive at fulﬁllment of human hap-
piness.”

Returned from the White
House on education, Janice
Thompson, freshman at Western
Michigan University, reported,
after the first dinner of the
convention, on her experiences
in meetings which included less‘
than twenty students out of
hundreds of national leaders.

In the afternoons’ of the week-
end, Curbstone Clinics were held

and joined the Foreign Service in
1943. After service in the United
States Naval Reserve he was as-
signed temporarily in 1946 to
Tiajuana, Mexico, and later in the
same year to La Paz.

In 1949 he became vice-consul
at Puerto la Cruz, in Vene-
zuela. He was transferred in
1955 to Washington, wherehe is
1952 to Naples, Italy, and in
now working as an international
relations oﬁicer with the Bu-
reau of Inter-American Affairs.

The Department of State has
announced that a written exam-
ination for the Foreign Service
will be held on June 24, 1957. A
candidate must be 20 years of age
and under 31 and a U. S. citizen
for nine years. Applications for
the one-day written examination
must be received by the Board of
Examiners in Washington, before
midnight May 1.

Successful candidates will be
appointed as officers to serve in
any of the 270 embassies, lega-
tions and consulates abroad, as
well as in the Department of
State in Washington.

Anyone wishing to get in touch
with Wollam may phone Dr. Wil-
liam Dusenberry at ext. 595 or at

A LOOK

at the record

From its founding in 1925, Pratt & Whit-
ney Aircraft has been essentially an en-
gineering company. Its primary objective
has been the design and development of
new aircraft engines of superior perform-
ance and dependability. The guiding
policy has always been, simply, that
technical excellence must be the para-
mount objective, attained through con-
stant eﬁort to improve upon the best.

As early as 1928 Pratt & Whitney Air-
craft’s Wasp engines powered Navy sea-
lanes which brought back world records
in altitude, range and speed from compe-
titions in Switzerland, Germany and
France. The following year, Wasp-

.powered Army Air Corps airplanes were

ﬂying combat formations at 30,000 feet.

All through the 1930s the power, range
and fuel economy of the Pratt & Whit-

ney Aircraft Wasp and Hornet engines.

were developed, and the engines seasoned

# C

with experience. Wiley Post, the Lind-
berghs, Martin and Osa Johnson, Amelia
Earhart, Admiral Byrd and Roscoe Tur-
ner were among the host of famous pilots
who made aviation history with Wasp
power.

During World War II, 50 percent of

the aircraft. powerplants for the Amer- .

ican air arms were engineered by Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft. Three of the ﬁve key
ﬁghter airplanes, a host of medium and
heavy bombers, and 98 percent of all the
military transports used Pratt & Whit-
ney Aircraft engines.

The postwar development of the J -57
gained the company a position of engi-
neering leadership in the jet ﬁeld. It

powered the ﬁrst jet aircraft to ﬂy faster _

than sound in level ﬂight, and is now

used in six supersonic ﬁghters, three —

bombers and the ﬁrst two American com-
mercial jet transports.

Broadly diversiﬁed engineering careers at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft offer truly ﬁne
opportunity for young men equipped to deal with challenging assignments. You will

This city which is striving to become a new shining
a center of progress is in danger of showing the world that
its Renaissance might turn out to be very thin and super-
ﬁcial. '
 Culture must be a part of this rebirth. Music is part
of the culture of the land, and the’ men whopresent that

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra has grown in na-

conditions presented to any metropolitan orchestra. They
have operated in the red for season after season. Private

The people of this city can no longer count on private sup-
port for a people’s orchestra.

this city. Chancellor Litchﬁeld has constantly reiterated

in the University’s role in community life. The students must
therefore accept equal responsibility for saving the orches-
tra from ﬁnancial ruin.

But what can students do? There are many groups on
this campus which seek recognition as being cultural and
academic. These organizations have a great tool to work
with in a fund-raising campaign of this type. They have

proper campaign could be organized. Such a program is
already underway on the neighboring campus of Carnegie

Of course the University of Pittsburgh could do a more
sizeable job in an area of this sort, but it would have to be
representative of the student body. .

A challenge has been presented. The goal is one which
can belong uniquely. to students. Students should meet the
challenge. M

In Political Parties . . .

By Murray Chass

Political parties involve more
than slating candidates and run-
ning campaigns for student
elections. While p e r f o r min g

parties incur

ties, in their
two years of recognized exist-
ence, have carried out the two
obvious duties, but have failed
miserably in meeting their cam-
paign ﬁnancial debts.

It was this lack of responsi-
bility that caused the 1956 Stu-
dent Elections Committee to re-
consider its positive stand on
parties. But because of the in-
crease in interest in the 1956.
elections, the Committee ﬁnally
chose to overlook the possible
future irresponsibility of the
groups.

After the first election that in-
volved parties, 1955, the Panther
Party owed a bill that amounted
to $100. This sum went unpaid
until November of the same
year. When last year’s elections
were over,‘ all three parties had
outstanding debts. The Panther
Party owed approximately $195,

Beck Sweating

How pathetic it is to see roly-
poly Dave Beck sweating it out
behind cameras and Senate spot-
lights, attempting to hide his
bulky frame and guilty.consci-
ence behind the oft-used Fifth
Amendment. How ironic too. For
this is the same Beck who in
1948 condemned people who
hide behind the shield of the
Amendment.

Beck at that time said, “I
have no time for that group of
individuals who hide behind
every technicality —— technical“-
ities which they would destroy
— to hide their subversive
thinking.” Beck was then re-
ferring to Communists on trial

for their wrong-doing,‘but even.

so, his feelings didn’t prevent
him using the same technicality
over 50 times during the two
days he was on stand recently

"before the Senate committee.

The ﬁrst two of these bills
were not taken care of until just
last month with the’ result that
the Pitt men had to pay a $5

linquished $45 in ﬁnes. The In-

their debts by the company in-

and they have paid the $17. t M

The parties have ignored their
ﬁnancial obligations in another
respect. The “Policy for Student
Political Parties,” drawn up by
the Elections Committee, re-
quires that partiesysubmit item-
ized ﬁnancial statements after
the elections. Thus far, out of
ﬁve parties that have existed

since their sanctioned beginning, a

only one has presented a report
to the Committee.

The main reason that these
ﬁnancial functions, bill payments
and ﬁnancial reports, were not
carried out is because the Elec-
tions Committee and the Dean
of Men’s Oﬁice had no exact
body of persons to hold respons-
ible since the parties dissolved
immediately after the elections.
Eni-ire Year —

One way to solve this problem
is to have political parties or-
ganized for an entire year and
not for a few weeks. I .

This necessarily does not mean
that the parties would have to
function formally during the
course of the year. The system
would work in the _following

When party formers are solicﬁg

iting students to sign petitions,‘

they would obtain the signatures
of only those students who are
deﬁnitely interested in belong-
ing to that party and not those
who merely are doing a friend
a favor by adding their names.
At the time the student signs, he
would be asked for membership
dues, which would be decided
upon previously by the organiz-
ers. .
Then the party members
would meet to elect officers and
thereafter meet as many or as
few times as they like. Of
course, they would have to meet
in order to approve slates, plat-
forms, and campaign methods.
In this system, candidates may
be slated by more than one par-
ty, but could own membership
in*only one.

As was stated above, the par-
ties would remain in existence
until the next election, operating
as they wish. At that time they
could disband or continue in the
same manner.

This method would not com-
pletely assure payment of out-
standing bills. It would, how-
ever, give the Committee some-
thing substantial from which to
seek payment, namely an official
continuous organization. The
Committee then would not have
to ask for money from indivi-
duals who had been slated by
erring parties, with the threat
that they would not be allowed
to run for office again.

of the most neglected.‘

I /2 M1 zoz/oézr/7;

. De Witt Clinton (sometimes called Aaron Burr) ﬁrst

made himself known to fame in 1756 when Governor

William Penn commissioned him to survey the forests of

- the Western Reserve. (One is inclined to wonder what in

O the world Governor Penn could have been thinking of,

for De Witt Clinton was eighteen months old at the time.)

However, the little chap did remarkably well. He surveyed

as far west as Spokane, teaching phonetic English to

L more than twelve million Indians along the way, and then,
tired ‘but happy, he became Johnny Appleseed. ‘

Later, he became a keelboat and sailed home to enter
I politics. He tried to join the Greenback Party, but his
back wasn't green enough, ‘so he joined the Whigs.

He was offered the Whig nomination for the presi-
dency, but declined with the celebrated statement: “If

nominated I will not run;

if elected I will not serve.”

But the Whigs only nudged eachother and said, “That
old fox, he’s just playing hard to get.” So they nominated
him anyhow, and sure enough he did not. run, but he was
elected anyhow, and sure enough he did not serve. In
fact‘, he was elected to a second term, which he also did
not serve. However, only -a few top Whigs knew there
was nobody inthe White House. The rest of ‘the country
thought that the President was conﬁned to his room with '
a wrenched lmee. For a while people sent “Get Well”
cards, but soon everyone forgot and turned their atten-
tion to important matters like opening the west, inventing
the buffalo, and the Black Tom Explosion.

After two terms as President, De Witt Clinton
entered Yale and took up smoking. He tried several
brands of cigarettes until he found the one brand that
pleased him in every particular-Philip Morris, of corris!

(You knew I was going to say that, didn’t you? Well,
of course you did, especially if you are a Philip Morris
smoker, for if you are, you know what a sweetheart of a
smoke Philip Morris is — how full of rich, natural ﬂavor,
how natural and mellow, how long size and regular. And
if you are not a Philip Morris smoker, you've got a treat
coming. Light one soon. Light either end.)

Upon graduation from Yale, De Witt Clinton became
commissioner of baseball and smoked and loved Philip
Morris Cigarettes for the rest of his long and distin-
guished life, and when at last he was called to his reward,
his friend Old Hickory (Daniel Webster), stood up in the
Senate and said, “How sad that De Witt Clinton must
now be forever separated from his beloved Philip Morris l”

“Nay!” cried Pitt, the Elder (Henry Clay), bounding
to his feet. “We need'not separate De Witt Clinton and
Philip Morris. I know how to keep them together always I”

And, sure enough, if you will look at the blue federal
tax stamp on your pack of Philip Morris, guess whose
picture you’ll see. De Witt Clinton's! That’s whose!

©Max Shulman, 1957

The makers‘ of Philip Morris, who bring you this column each
week, don’: subscribe to Old Max’s historical data, but we
sure admire his taste in cigarettes. You, will too. Try a new

natural Philip Morris today!

As mentor Lewis says, “We’ll try

The youthful Lewis, who is
hoping to get his ﬁrst full sea-
son as Panther mitt coach un-
derway, is understandably dis-
turbed about the weather situ-
ation. “We have to get some
games in if we hope to do any-
thing against VMI Saturday

when we go down there,” he
states. “They have been able to

get ﬁve games in already, and
their teamwork and timing will
be a lot better than ours.”

Commenting on the condition
of the Jungle Cats, he says, “We

"were sharper two weeks ago than
we are now. It’s pretty hard to
get much done in the Field House.
You can simulate conditions there,
but you don’-t have the real pres-
sure that you experience in a
regular game. The boys are na-
turally disappointed, but so far
-they’re not discouraged.”

Last Friday the Panthers at-
tempted to get an intra—squad
game played, but as the varsity
was at bat against the new fresh-
men in the last half of the ﬁrst
inning the now-daily’cloudburst
hit and ended practice for the day.

By MURRAY CHASS

For the fourth time in eight days Coach Bobby Lewis’
Panthers will try to open the diamond ‘season tomorrow
this time against the California Teachers in California.

The latest postponement came on Saturday. The local
mittmen were scheduled for a double-header with tomorrow’s

opponents, but a combination of rain, wet grounds, and low
the third: .

teams‘ already do. Lewis thinks
that this is entirely possible next
year because‘ the mid-semester
break will come earlier than this

year, and the players will be '

able to travel without sacriﬁcing
classes.

This is the method of which
some of the Panthers’ foes, such
as Ohio State, take advantage.
The Buckeyes recently toured the
southern section of the country

Open Tomorrow

with the result that they have
already played six games, win-
ning four of them. ,~

Five other future Panther op-
ponents have had the fortune of
starting their seasons by this time.
VMI, the local nine’s Saturday
foe, has had ﬁve’ tussles, coming
up with a poor 1-4 mark. Cornell
is 2-1-1, Bucknell has lost its only
game, West Virginia has one win,
and Navy is in with three vic-
tories and one stalemate out of
ﬁve contests.

C

In Coach Lewis’ memory, a
Panther baseball team has
never gone this far without
actually starting the season. “If
we were rained. out onetime,”
he says, “we were usually lucky
the second time.”

Training is pretty much full-time at
DuPont, Ed. The main objective is
to train men to reach their full capa-
bilities as soon as possible. So we give,
the new man responsibility the day
he arrives, and increase itas oppor-
tunities are available and he’s ready
for more responsibility.

That’s the basic, guiding policy. But
DuPont has many departments. And
training has many facets.

In some plants, the college graduate
being trained for.supervision is moved

through all areas of the production
cycle. In others, where the technical
phases are more involved, he may
spend time in a laboratory or devel-
opment group before moving on to
production.

It works the same way in sales. The
graduate may first learn the labora-
tory side of the products he’slgoing to
sell. Or he may start right out on

learning selling techniques. That all

depends on -the products and markets
involved.

The same on-the-job principle ap-
plies to new men in specialized ﬁelds
of research, development or design . . .
including daily contacts with super-
vision, frequent lectures, discussions
and conferences. Periodic changes in
assignment, too.

lt’s carefully planned, individualized
training, Ed. We’ve found it’s the
most effective way to broaden a man
quickly. DuPont is a growing organ-
ization. And men with leadership po-
tential are always in demand.

Denton B. Harris joined Du Pont’s Engi-
neering Research Laboratory in June,
1952, after completing work for an M.S.
in civil engineering at the University of
Massachusetts. He’s currently working
on an unusual project—-a broad study of
the philosophy of design. The objective
is to learn more about people’s design
preferences, and the trends behind new
concepts in industrial design. This new

assignment came after Denton gained-~———

several years of experience in various
kinds of civil engineering at DuPont.

‘ A I o p o
  Strength lIl Field Events
, By JOHN FAY
Coach Carl Olson has high hopes that a new University
record will be set this Saturday in the discus by Wesley

King, the big junior from Greensburg, when the Panther
‘thinclads open their dual meet season with Army. The

; 1

present
,Welc_h, will be on hand to oﬁiciate
this event; Larry Och will give
King support int he discus throw,
one of the locals’ stronger ﬁeld
events.

Looking forward to the outdoor
season, I the Panthers have two
other veterans,
in addition to
Och, back from
1 a s t y e a r ’ s
squad to com-
pete in the shot
put. Corny Sal-
v a t e r r a , the
football star
who was unable
to compete in
t r a c kg 1 a s t
spring because
of a b r o k e n
ankle, is the team’s big hope in
this event. p I

Salvaterra is also the leading
man in Coach Olson’s plans for
the javelin, and it is hoped by
the coaching staff that he will
be throwing over 200 feet before

record holder, Gilbert:

    

the ‘season closes- Pete Bizic
and Och are the other contest-
ants who will throw the javelin.

With veteran track star Bill
Smith back to lead the pole vault-
ers, the Blue and Gold should do
quite well in this event. Last year

Smithplaced ﬁrst in the vault in‘

almost every dual and triangular
meet, and this season Coach Olson
thinks he can clear 14 feet which
will probably be good enough to
take a first place in nearly every
dual meet.

A very promising sophomore,
Max Kumer, will give Smith good
support in the vault along with
Ron Zimmerman. The prospect of
a few second and third places in
this event will greatly help the
team’s score in a department
where - such support was sorely
lacking last year.

There is a big weak spot in
the broad jump this season.
With Arnie Sowell gone, the
Panthers are left with no lead-

Panthers Revive Fresh Baseballs

By JIM LACEY

For the first time since 1950 the
Panthers will have a freshman
baseball team. “We will probably
have a better team than the 1950
nine,”’ says newly appointed coach
Dave Starrett, “which didn’t do too
well.”

The present schedule calls for
the Panther Yearlings to play four
games. Single games have been
scheduled with West Virginia and
Kiski, and a home and away series
with Shady Side Academy. Coach
Starrett is hopeful, however, of

ing man in this event. Smith
should be able to place regu-
larly, but the prospects of any
first‘ places are not bright.

Sophomores Al Templin, Walt -

Talbert, and Vince Wojnar will
also do some jumping for the,
squad.

Only the high jump remains
among the ﬁeld events for the
coming track season.‘ Ron Sieman
and Regis Goggin, both of whom
performed well last year as fresh-
men, will lead the varsity squad
in this event this spring. Charles
Heﬂin, a senior who is one of the
top dash men on the team, will
also do some jumping along with
King.

Bob Russell, another sophomore,
will probably compete in the high
jump, too.

card within the next week.

Rain and lack of training fa-
cilities have plagued the early
practices. However, the ﬁrst
week of drills shows two stand-
out players.

They are Ron Worth, a pitcher
and service veteran, and Dick Ma-
jeski, a shortstop. All the positions
are wide open. Coach Starrett
hopes that more players will come
to practice because no lineup has
been picked. He suggests, “The
freshman team will become the
stepping stone to the varsity.”
Coach Starrett is new in the
coaching ﬁeld, having graduated
from Skyscraper U. He played on
the last frosh team and then two
years on the varsity with two
years out for service.

The Cubs will have until Fri-
day, April 19, to get into shape
