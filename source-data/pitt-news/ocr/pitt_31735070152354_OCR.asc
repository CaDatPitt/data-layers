  Board looks to make changes,

proposes Student Governing Code

Danielle Fox
Stcyff Wrz’tér D

The Student Government Board has lost im-
portant documents throughout the past four
years because the Board hasn’t had anywhere
to put them. D

But now, SGB President Mike Nites is pro-
posing a remedy to the problem through the
establishment of a “Student Governing Code,”
which would compile the Board’s policies and
procedures into one document available on
its website.

The Board met in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom at 8:45 p.m Tuesday to introduce
eight bills, which dictate the contents of the
code, andwillvote on the bills nextweek. The
Board also unanimously voted to institute an
official code of ethics, to repeal the previous
Board’s media policy and to publicly decide
its budget in the ﬁxture. About 15 people at-
tended the 45—minute meeting.

While the Board will not officially vote
on the Student Governing Code until next
week, Nites said the code will outline SGB
policies that were.previously undeﬁned or
undocumented *

The Board will also adopt its bylaws into
the proposed Student Governing Code, which
will be separated into six sections labeled
“chapters.” The chapters will include infor-
mation on the president, the Board, commit-
tees, Green Fund Advisory Board, legislation
and other governing documents.

Nites said important documents are lost

p from year to year because they are not in-

cludedinthe bylaws. .
While the Board already documented its

code of ethics, Board members were not re-

quiredto follow it
Because the code is now mandatory, the

 pm. She said she was annoyed by having
 to drive from her mother’s house in Peters

Township to Oakland after receiving the call

because she was under the impression that
the situation was minor.

Keddal arrived at the scene at about 11
p.m.

“I was not expecting to drive up to that
situation,” Keddal said. “I had a panic at-
tack. I had to ask-a lot of times if everyone

judicial committee will penalize Board mem-

bers if they break the code by, for example,-

voting on an allocations request for a student
organization in which they hold member-
ship. Nites said the punishments will vary in
severity, from issued warnings to a dismissal
from the Board.

In addition to instituting their own poli-
cies, the Board voted to repeal a policy of the
previous Board.

The former Board enacted a media policy
last April and sent The Pitt News and WPTS
Radio a set of media guidelines after both
organizations separately reported that six of
nine SGB members were part of a secret soci-
ety known as the Druids. The Board did not
issue the guidelines to other news organiza-
tions, including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
and The Pittsburgh Tribune.

Former president Gordon Louderback
said before the meeting that the issues that
led to the policy no longer exist, and he would
not comment on whether the Druid stories
sparked the policies.

Under the media policy, the Board re-
quired that reporters check in with the
Board’s secretary upon arrival to the ofﬁce
and then receive an invitation into the office
by the Board member the reporter wanted
to interview. The policy also established an
“open door/open area policy,” which prohib-

ogy, French and preoptometry major and
Ian Quinn, an information sciences major,
shared the second floor.

Fuchiang and Fenfang Tsui, the land-
lords, declined to comment about the ex-
plosion.

As of Jan. 3, investigators were still
searching for the cause of the ﬁre. Accord-
ing to Michael Burford, an investigator at

ited SGB affiliates from holding closed-door
meetings with reporters in the Board’s office.

The Pitt News refused to comply with the
policy, and the Board. did not actively enforce
the guidelines the following semester.

The bill repealing the media guidelines
allows the Board “to remain open and wel-
coming to the student body ...regardless of

Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, the ﬁre investi-

gators are inclined to deem a natural gas
explosion as the cause.

Once Keddal saw the pile of splintered
fumiture, rubbage and black debris that had
once been her home, she knew that nothing
could be salvaged.

“It was sickening that that could’ve hap-
pened when we were there,” Keddal said.

The students also lost valuable belong-
ings to the ﬂames.

Keddal wishes she hadn’t lost her Build-
A-Bear, which she made with her room-
mates during her freshman year at the
University of South Carolina. Keeping the

their affiliation with the media.”

N ites added that the Board intends to ’

treat all students equally through the new bill.

“We let 17,000 other students come freely
into our office,” Nites said. “If there is [a stu-
dent] at the front desk, we don’t ask them to
wait at theldesk until [the Board member]
is ready for them,” Nites said. “Why should

b_ bear close to her throughout college was a

way of remembering her friends.

But Keddal cannot avoid the spot where
she lost so many of her belongings, as her
parking permit allows her to park in the
area near her former home.

“I stop and look at the pile of wood every
single time, and I just can’t believe that was
our place,” Keddal said. Becker and Quinn
reacted similarly to the news.

At about 7:30 p.m., Becker woke up
from her post—Thanksgiving nap to a ring-
ing phone with a call from Quinn, who ex-
plained that an explosion occurred within
their house. ‘ H

20 students or 30 students within the Pitt
News, who might have any opportunity to
be involved with SGB, be treated different?”

Nites said if reporters are disruptively
“hanging around the office” while the Board
is discussing private matters, the Board

“It’s not really a phone call that anyone
expects to get,” she said.

Becker waited as long as she could to visit
the site because she thought it would be too
difficult to look at the remains of the house.

She planned to create a collage of ticket
stubs from her recent spring semester in
Paris, but she lost the stubs in the ﬁre. The
sight of her home’s charred remains also
vanquished her plans to salvage some pieces
of furniture for her ﬁrst apartment after
college.

“When I ﬁrst got back, [Quinn and I]
were pretty upset,” Becker said. “We didn’t
live by our friends anymore. We felt iso-
lated.”

The University offered free housing for
the remainder of the fall semester to the
residents of the house.

Becker and Keddal stayed in Lothrop
Hall for the rest of the semester, while Quinn
stayed in Litchﬁeld Tower C. The University
did not provide Krupp with housing because

she is not a Pitt student, and she instead

commuted to her classes.

This semester, Keddal and Krupp have
been commuting to school until their new
house is ready for residents. According to
Keddal, the two are renting a new house
with different landlords. Keddal declined to
comment on where she and her roommate
are going to live.

“We’ve known each other since we were
kids,” Keddal said of her roommate. “This
really is a dramatic event that brought us
closer together.”

Quinn and Becker have since moved into
an apartment on Semple Street, where they
signed a new lease, but their reactions to the
explosion made for a challenging transition.

Becker said she was overwhelmed with
emotions, which made studying difficult
as the semester ended, but the students
said they didnot have problems making ar-
rangements with their professors following
the explosion.

Despite the chaos, Keddal said she was
able to complete the fall semester on a high
note academically through teachers’ sup-
port, which included assignment and ﬁnal
exam extensions.

Gamma Sigma Sigma,'a service sorority
at Pitt, worked to fundraise for the students
affected by the explosion. ' _

According to GSS President Maria Lo-
pez, a junior majoring in rehabilitation sci~
ences, the sorority encouraged sisters to
rummage through their closets, basements
and garages for items —— clothing, home
appliances or school supplies -— that the
students might need.

Alyssa Kurtz, the public relations co-
ordinator and a junior majoring in social
work and sociology, and Jessi Collins, the

service vice president and a junior majoring
in neuroscience, organized the fundraiser
after Thanksgiving break.

According to Collins, GSS plans to accept
donations from only sisters because of the
sorority’s size.

The Student Government Board is also
contributing efforts to help the affected sni-
dents. According to former—Board mem-
ber Sowmya Sanapala, the former Board
planned to work with a few members of this
semester’s Board to assemble ﬁmdraising
efforts.

Onjan. 4, The Board launched an emer-
gency relief fundraiser with a goal of $1,000
through a virtual fundraising website called
Fundly, according to Board member Graeme
Meyer.

The Board will also sell T-shirts for $5 in
Litchﬁeld Towers lobby next week and do-
nate the sales to the victims of the explosion.
Meyer said SGB will announce the speciﬁc
dates and times of the fundraiser next week.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said in an
email that he was not aware of any fundrais-
ing efforts by the University.

But Pitt isn’t new to supporting students I
after similar disasters. Last spring, when a

house on Zulema Street where 13 Pitt stu- '
dents lived caught ﬁre, The University re—_

sponded with similar efforts, including free
housing for the remainder of the semester
and textbook loans for the students. SGB
also held a T—shirt sale to fundraise for the
affected students.

Support for Keddal and her roommates
came from outside of the University com-
munity as well.

Keddal said she had no idea how many *

people cared about her until she found out

that her employer had organized a fund- ,

raiser to support her.

Jason Miller, the owner of the online di-
rectory Active Pittsburgh, began the {im-
draiser on GoFundMe, a virtual donation
site, on Thursday, Dec. 5.

Keddal has worked as an Active Pitts-
burgh intern since March 2013. She pro-
moted and wrote feature articles for the
site, which Miller launched in September
2013. According to Miller, Keddal became
Miller’s “right—hand man” in helping to de-
velop the business.

would meet privately with the members of
the news organization to discuss the conflict.
Board member Graeme Meyer said the
Board discussed replacing the media policy
with an ofﬁce—wide policy that required visi-
tors to sign in, which would help keep track
ofvisitors during office hours. The Board did

V not further discuss the matter.

In an effort to increase transparency, the
Board also Voted to publicly decide on its
budget. '

Previously, the Board privately submit-
ted its budget to the Allocations Commit-
tee. The committee recommends how the
Board should spend the $2.3 million Student
Activities Fund to which every non-College
of General Studies student contributes $80
each semester.

According to Alex Maj chrzak, former Al—
locations Committee chair, the committee
traditionally denied a portion of the Board’s
budget if the requests did not adequately
document how or when the Board would
spend the money. But the Board could ap-

Join P:ttP9r ail

peal the decision and receive the full amount. ,

During his campaign, Nites promised to
increase transparency within student govern-
ment and proposed that the Board publicly
vote on the budget. His slate mates, Brandon
Benjamin and SaraKlein, supported the idea.
Klein discussed Voting on the budget publicly
during a November 2013 debate between
candidates running for the 2014 Board.

Once the Board reviews student orga-
nizations’ appeals to their budget requests,
it will defend its own budget requests at a
public meeting. Student organizations must
submit their semesterly budgets, or requests
for money from the Student Activities Fund,
for next semester by March.

The allocations chairwill then present the
committee’s rationale for each of the Board’s
appealed requests, and the business manager
will defend the requests before the Board
makes a decision.

While the Board will still have the ultimate .
say on the appealed requests, N ites said mak-
ing the process public is “a step in the right
direction” toward transparency.

Majchrzak said that students should have
access to thebudget to offer criticism.

Nites said he will post a copy of the SGB

 

swing,

budget on the Board’s website after it is ad-
opted, which will allow students to comment
with opinions on the budget and the Board.

In addition to the three votes, the Board

also appointed Board members Ellie Tsat- '

sos to president pro tempore and Abby Zur-
schmit to business manager, and appointed
ten students to the Allocations Committee.

Keepingwith tradition, Nites nominated
Tsatsos to president pro tempore because she
received the highest number of votes between
the Board members. The president pro tem-
pore would act as president if Nites would be
unable to attend a meeting or fulﬁll his term.

N ites said he chose to nominate Zur-
schmit to business manager after working
with her the previous year, when she was the
chair of the Safety and Transportation Com-
mittee. The business manager constructs the
Board’s budget, acts as liaison to the Alloca-
tions Committee and works more directly
with the allocations chair on requests.

“She was always on the ball with every-
thing,” Nites said.

The Board did not review any allocations
requests. I

“It was weird because I was touching
base with her to see how things were going
with an article she was working on, and she

Miller said.

Miller wanted to help her ﬁnancially by

he said includes several thousand people.

He has been advertising the fundraiser

With the help of those who care about
her recovery, Keddal said she is recovering
her life as a new semester begins.

that are offering their help,” Keddal said. “I

EDITORIAL COLUMN

National health care advocates
quanti , undennines quality

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

When Lyndon B.]ohnson signed
Medicare into lawjuly 30, 1965,
skepticism was immediately om-
nipresent among the American
public. Simply put, the bill was
just too complicated for many
people to comprehend.

As a result, the public natural-
ly clung to the talking points and

- rhetoric spewing from the media

at the time in order to formulate
their opinions on the bill. For in-
stance, the American Medical As-
sociation called it “the beginning
of socialized medicine,” and poli-
ticians warned of the inevitable
army of ‘eligible senior citizens
busting down hospital doors as
a consequence of the expansive
program. An apprehensive, polar-
ized Congress and their constitu-
ents braced in apocalyptic—like
fashion for the day these beneﬁts
would become available for se-
niors. The start of the rollout was
coined “M-day” by the New York
Times in 1966. Many of the same
tactics have been employed in the
rheto_rical war over the Affordable
Care Act.

The Affordable Care Act, or
Obamacare, is an inherently dif-
ferent story, but there are paral-
lels such as the comparable rhet-
oric, which includes a similarly
polarizing effect, and the almost
identical worries e.g., the long
lines and Uncle Sam prying into
our doctor’s office.

Unlike Medicare, however, the
Affordable Care Act’s rollout has
been anything but smooth.

With many having trouble
gaining their promised beneﬁts

on a severely broken website
alongside others losing their
coverage, the program has al-
ready been marred soon after its
commencement. But if anything,
the rollout of Medicare should
provide some historical context.

When M—day came it was rath-
er anticlimactic. Of the 19 million
seniors eligible for health care, 93
percent enrolled in the summer
of 1966.’ But the long lines never
came, and hospitals braced for
the worst, only to ﬁnd their pes-
simism met with a surprisingly
smooth rollout. There were some
bumps in the road, for instance,
some hospitals in the South re-

’ fused to hand out the beneﬁts

to eligible blacks. Nonetheless,
today Medicare is an extremely

popular program. Most Arneri—.

cans expect to reap the beneﬁts,
and no politician would ever
dream of cutting it — so even-
tually, the program was deemed
worth the cost.

Although Medicare’s smooth
rollout set it on a path toward suc-
cess, the initial quantitative prob-
lems with the Affordable Care Act
can be easily overcome, at least in
comparison to the troubles the
rollout poses in terms of quality
of care.

On the aforementioned is-
sues the rollout has already
faced, President Barack Obama
assured in his end-of-the-year
press conference that “a couple
million people, maybe more, are
going to have health care onjan.
1.” This claim is backed by rising
enrollment numbers on Health-
care.gov and by widespread reg-
istration found in the new State
Health Exchanges. For example,
New York state has had more

than 100,000 people sign up for
coverage, with about one—third
signing up for Medicaid, and the
remaining two-thirds selecting
private insurance. So while many
other state legislatures are still
squabbling over expansion, New
York state officials say they are
on track in reaching their goal of
having 1.1 million state residents
insured by the end of 2016.

Furthermore, the Obama ad-
ministration has acted on the fact
that many lost their insurance at
the beginning of the rollout by
temporarily canceling the indi-
vidual mandate for those whose
plans were rescinded. Thus, giv-
ing the government the chance
to smooth out the threshold of
the mandate.

The numbers are improving,
and “that is a big deal,” as Obama
said. Some hospitals across the
nation might agree that it is a
“big deal,” but not nearly with
the same level of optimism.

There still exists a very dra-
matic concern —— similar to the
one that existed during Medi-
care’s inception —— that the roll-
out will cause an inﬂux -of patients
who will overwhelm hospital
staffs across the country. Doc-
tors such asjeannette South—Paul

- of UPMC’s Matilda Theiss Health

Center in Oakland have voiced
such concerns.

“We’re going to be inundated
with patients,” she said. With
more than 200,000 uninsured
people living in Western Penn-
sylvania, South—Pal claimed

V there simply “aren’t enough of

[doctors]” for UPMC to be fully
prepared for the rollout. Other
doctors believe these worrieseare

exaggerated.

Dr. C. Richard Schott, a Philadelphia-
area cardiologist and president of the
Pennsylvania Medical Society, said, “It’s
very unlikely that 30 million people are
going to instantly appear on the doorsteps
of physicians across the country as ofjan.

“Historically, people in this country and in
this state have had access to care.”

Sick patients have always come to
hospitals with or without insurance, and
hospitals will not house patients with mi-

ference in admissions,” Shapiro said.

LETTERS To THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

I recently read the article that you
published about Peter Mastracci’s
sudden passing. I ﬁnd it to be in incred-
ibly poor taste that the author
would give details of his suicide. Have
you not heard of journalistic ’
integrity? Do you even know the defini-
tion of the word 5‘tact”?

Peter was a human being with many
friends and family members who care
for him and are still attempting to cope
with his sudden death.

Your article was incredibly trigger-
ing. I ﬁnd it completely irresponsible
that you would allow something so in-
sensitive to be published in your paper.

To the Editor,

I graduated from Pitt last April. I made incredible friends through Pitt, including
Peter Mastracci. After reading Gideon Bradshaw’s article about Peter, I felt anger,
sadness and frustration at The Pitt News.

In the ﬁfth line, Mr. Bradshaw wrote, “authorities determined that Mastracci
committed suicide.” The details of a person’s death are only released to the next of
kin, so I am concerned about how Mr. Bradshaw obtained information that»wasn’t
published anywhere. However, I am most disgusted that Mr. Bradshaw printed it
at all. Apparently, this reporter never considered that this article might be the
ﬁrst time Peter’s family and friends learned that Peter killed himself. A Pitt News
article isn’t exactly the way I would have preferred to receive that information.
There isn’t an ideal way to learn that one of your best friends committed suicide,
but I wish Mr. Bradshaw would consider the implications of what he’s done. I, and
many other people close to Peter, learned this from one line in an article that was
ostensibly about his legacy. Peter stood for equality, and he wasn’t afraid to be
who he was. I don’t want suicide to be part of Peter’s legacy. Suicide is not Peter,
and Peter is not suicide. Peter is an incredible man who made me less afraid to be
myself. His decision to commit suicide was tragic, but it does not deﬁne him. I
hope Mr. Bradshaw considers how this feels.

ACC BREAKDOWN 1

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Wrz'ter

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon has continu-
ously preached that the program’s move
to the ACC would help form the best col-
lege basketball conference in the country.

The season is still young, but the new-
look ACC is shaping out to become a mid-
dle-of-the-pack league, which is ironic
because without the help of former Big
East juggernauts Syracuse, Pitt and Notre
Dame, the ACC would be in a state of total
dismay. And outside the top ﬁve teams,
the league is still in the midst of chaos.

Syracuse (14-0, 1-0 ACC)

After chipping its way through non-
conference play blemish-free, No. _2 Syr-
acuse beat Miami in comeback fashion
Saturday to claim its ﬁrst win in the ACC.

and they have made do withjerami Grant

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Physicality, depth

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt basketball helped toughen up Cal Poly,

evolving it from a boy’s basketball team to

a men’s team, according to Mustangs coach

Joe Callero after the Panthers’ win Dec. 21.

Albany coach Will Brown “drives [his] wife

crazy” with how much and how intently he

watches basketball, making sure he gets a
look at as many teams as possible. But even he
failed to account for the players and aspects of
Pitt’s game that led to another Panther victory.

Afteramid—November defeat at the hands

of Pitt, Fresno State head coach Rodney Terry
spoke about how much the contest seasoned
his younger players and howthe blowout loss
would prepare them for tough opponents
down the road. Terry dished out this praise
for a team that had played just two regular-
season games.

Coach after coach has left the court in de-
feat against Pitt, strolled through the doors
of the press room and eventually expressed a
consistent message: The Panthers are physical
and versatile from the top to bottom of their
deep, talented rotation. »

“We had a couple ofloose-ball and missed-
shot situaﬁons where I think the physicality
of the game caught up to us,” Callero said
after the Pitt-Cal Poly matchup. “You could
see Pitt getting stronger during that period
—— shots, rhythm and feel of the game. I think
we exerted a ton of energy just to be highly
competitive going after the rebound. That’s
where we fatigued, and they took great ad-
vantage of that.”

Pitt’s win Monday against Maryland ex-
tended this theme.

“I thought Pittsburghwas terriﬁc,” Terra-
pins head coachMarl<-Turgeon said, liitinghis

eyebrows and slowly shaking his head. “They

gﬁ‘ <-musmmagae -4.... ._ 1...»... 4.4. _. ,.......-..,

were deep, had a lot of guys make shots for
them, executed well, and they were tremen-
dous on defense.”

It’s not a coincidence that the ﬁrst two
words Turgeon used to describe the Panthers
were “terriﬁc” and “deep.”

Pitt used its entire 13-man roster in the
79-59 victory, with major contributions from
Durand Johnson (17 points in 23 minutes),
Josh Newkirk (eight points in 18 minutes) and

Jamel Artis (four points and three rebounds
in 10 minutes). .

In 62 total minutes from players coming
off the bench, the Panthers got 31 points on
12-of-17 shooting —— including 5-of-6 from
3-point range — nine rebounds and ﬁve as-
sists.

“Pitt’s really good. They’re deep, they’re
physical, they guard you, they play hard, and
theyexecute. It’s a different guy every night
for them, and they’re really deep,” Turgeon

fueling Panthers’ torrid start

said, twice more pegging Pitt with the “deep”
descriptor. ‘

That wealth of talent prevented Maryland
from making an extended run, rendering its
disparity in defensive effort and performance

p toughtowatch.TheTerrapins’largeststretch

of unanswered scoring was a meager four
points.

“Our bench was the thingthat got us going
in the ﬁrst half and continued throughout the
second h ,” Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said.

Brown, the hoops junkie, doesn’t envi-
sion a dropoﬂ? in Pitt’s depth — and, in turn,
doesn’t foresee a decline in the Panthers’
performance.

“Pitt is never going to be out of a game
because they defend and rebound,” he said
on Dec. 31. “They should be undefeated 
Pitt is a team that nobody is going to enjoy

PITT IN THE NFL

Former Panthe

Sean Corrado
Staff Wrz'ter

After cruising his way to the league rushing
title, former Pitt running back LeSean Mc-
Coy (Pitt 2007-2008) was a storyline worth
following this past weekend, which marked
the start of the NFL playoffs.

But the performances of two less heralded
Pitt alumni were lost in the wild card week-
end, obscured by McCoy’s relatively mediocre
numbers in the Philadelphia Eagles’ loss and

blownoutofthewaterby enthrallingcontests. _

Although former Pitt stars McCoy and
Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt 2002-2003) met high
expectations at the NFL level in 2013, fel-
low alumni Mike McGlynn (Pitt 2004-2007)
of the Indianapolis Colts and Andy Lee (Pitt
2000-2004) of the San Francisco 49ers are

still alive in the playoffs and doing their part ,

in the chase for a championship.

Despite battling an elbow injury at the
end of the regular season, McGlynn, an.of-
fensive guard, has been an integral piece in
a struggling Colts’ offensiveline. Because of
various injuries, the Colts have started a dif-
ferent combination of linemen eight times
during the season.

Yet McGlynn has proven a staple of consis-
tency, his versatility helping to pave the way

"for quarterback Andrew Luck. The 6—foot-4

lineman has started mostly at guard this sea-
son, but he might also be the best center on
the line. When center Samson Satele struggled
to stay healthy early inthe season, itwas Mc-
Glynn who took command of the position.
With McGlyrm at center, the offensive line
stepped up just in.time for the playoffs. In a
wild— card matchup against Kansas City, he
led the line in securing the second-largest
comeback victory in NFL playoffhistory. The
line allowed only one sack and gave Luck the
time he needed to erase a28 point deﬁcit and

lead Indianapolis to a 45-44 win. _
The Colts take on the New England Pa-

triots‘ in the divisional round Sunday in Fox— _

borough, lvlassg, where. McGlynn looks to
stabilize the offense in anotherplayof.fvictory.
San Francisco also has a couple of Pitt

alumni determined to ﬁght for _a Super Bowl.

2008-2010)‘, awide receiver. . _ 0
l I Leecontinued to prove he was among the
elitespecial’ weapons in the league dur-
ing  season. He ﬁnished  in
the  averaging 48.2 yards per punt.
- The 10 -year-(pro booted three balls for 110
yards and landed one inside the opposing

’ 20-yard line in a 23-20 playoff win Sunday

against Green Bay despite frigid weather,
which makes punting a football feel more
like punting a rock.

Baldwin has not been an asset at all for
the 49ers, catching only three passes for 28
yardsthis season. However, should a wide
receiver such as Anquan Boldin or Michael
Crabtree — who are both injury prone — get
dinged up, Baldwinwill have to step up during
the postseason run. ’

Lee, Baldwin and the rest of the 49ers
travel to Carolina, the NFC’s No. 2 seed, to
meet the Panthers on Sunday afternoon in
the divisional round. _

While Lee and Baldwin continue their sea-
sons, the most successﬁil former Panther of
2013, McCo3g _saw his playoff rim end rather
quickly when the Eagles fell in a last—second,
26-24 loss Saturday against the New Orleans
Saints.

McCoy did his part againstatough Saints

.. defense, running for 77 yards and a score

on 21 carries. He also added 15 yards receiv-
ing, but the Eagles offense failed to convert
on numerous third downs, and kicker Alex
Henery missed a crucial 48-yard ﬁeld goal

in the ﬁrst half.

McCoy led all of the NFL in rushing yards
(1,607) and yards from scrimmage (2,146),
becoming the ﬁrst Pitt alumnus to take the
league rushing title since Hall of Famer Curtis
Martin did in 2004.

The Eagles reacted positively after their
defeat. McCoy kept shaking his head during
postgame interviews and indicated that he
could not believe his seasonwas already over,
but he also said that he is excited for_what.the
offseason can bring to thef§0\i4‘t_\eam'.

“Shady” looks to be theﬁrstto take back-
to-back rushing titles since LaDainian Tom-
linson did with the Chargers seven years ago.

The playoff dreams for the rest of the for-
mer Pitt players were never realized, but that
didn’t stop them from performing among the
league’s best.

The Arizona Cardinals barely missed the
playoffs, but Fitzgerald, a receiver, turned
2013 into a comeback season of sorts.

After a disappointing2012 campaign that
only produced four touchdowns, Fitzgerald
found consistency in quarterback Carson
Palmer, went off for 954 yards and was 10th
in the league with 10 receiving touchdowns.

His resurgence comes at a critical time
too, as Fitzgerald might endure a dramatic
offseason.

Before the trade deadline in the middle
of the season, he was rumored to be shipped
to another team to clear salary cap room.
Fitzgerald will make $18 million next season.

Tampa Bay comerback Darrelle Revis
(Pitt 2004-2006) also might experience a
turbulent offseason.

Revis, who is a man-to-man cover cor-
ner, struggled to produce in the Tampa Bay
zone defense in his ﬁrst campaign with the
Buccaneers. He recorded 50 tackles and two
interceptions —— both of which are career

rs help push teams through wild—card games

lows — in a full season.

Revis’ contract is not guaranteed after this
season, therefore, it is up to how new Tampa
Bay head coach Lovie Smith and new defen-
sive coordinator Leslie Frazier will want to
use Revis going forward. The seven-year pro
has never been one to take apay cut, which is
worth considering as the new coaching staff
handles the situation.

Jabaal Sheard (Pitt 2007-2010) ﬁnished
with a down year after suffering from early
knee injuries. The 6-foot-2 lineman had 39
total tackles and 5.5 sacks, which slipped
from his 55 and seven line from the previ-
ous season.

The Browns, although starting the year
impressively, fell to the bottom of the AFC
North after losing 10 of their last 11 games.

Sheard worked inversely to his team’s suc-
cess, though, as he struggled early on in the
season with injuries, but recorded three sacks
in his ﬁnal ﬁve games. _

After working his tail of to stay on the
Houston Texan roster, running back Ray Gra-
ham (Pitt 2009-2012) recorded his ﬁrst NFL
carry against Tennessee in the ﬁnal game of .
the season. Graham ﬁnished with four car-
ries for eight yards and hauled in a 12-yard
reception.

Next year, defensive tackle Aaron Donald
hopes to highlight the weekly roundup of
former Panthers in the NFL. The four-time
award-winning senior is projected by industry
gurus to go withinthe ﬁrst couple picks of the
second round in the 2014 NFL Draft.

Donald might become the highest-drafted
Pitt product since Baldwin was selected by
the Kansas City Chiefs with the 26th overall
pick in 2011. The heralded, but comparatively
small, defensive tackle has to prove his worth
again —— this time in the pros —— but his tal-
ent puts him in the right position to do so. I

Notre Dame (10-4, 0-1 ACC)

After an early season blowout loss to
Indiana State at home, the Irish might

as the weather gets milder. Three weeks

The Cavalier faithful‘ had the utmost
conﬁdence in their team being legitimate
contenders coming into the season, but
they’ve yet to collect a signature win this
season, dropping a game early against
VCU and losing to Wisconsin in a game
where UVA was only able to put up 38
points. Fifth—year head coach Tony Ben-

very competitive game Wednesday against
