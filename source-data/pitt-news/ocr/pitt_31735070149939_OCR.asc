escalators

By Andrew Shull
Assistant News Editor

Stand-up comedian Mitch Hed-
berg said during one of his shows
that escalators can never break
—- they can only become stairs.

Repairmenshould hang a sign
that reads, “Sorry for the conve-
nience,” he said. H

If Hedberg were still alive, he
probably would not receive many
laughs 'after’.‘te11iii,€!."TEli§1f'i§5k¢;in

A new software system will end
the backlog that has stymied stu-
dent groups’ attempts to reserve
rooms.

In order to reserve rooms for
meetings‘ and ' events, student
groups have to ‘make reservation
requests to the desk on the Main

Floor of the William Pitt Union. ,.

But the current system causes
extended waits ,— sometimes
weeks long — as well as overlap,
in which the same room will be
reserved by multiple groups. SGB
Board member Gordon Louder-
back decided to star_t,_a pilot pro-

gram, beginningthis summer, to
help ease thevprocess of reserv-
ing rooms. .’ ’
“The current software is
primarily designed for the reg-
istrar’s office to use academic
space,” said Associate Dean and
Director of Student Life Kenyon
Bonner. “It is much different than
student groups reserving rooms
for events. The software wasn’t

designed for ‘student groups, and.

the limitations of the system have
become obvious.”

Kate Malekoff, a senior who
helped Louderback take action
with this initiative, said the new
system will make the process of
reserving rooms “more stream-
lined.”

“The system we have now is so
divided that it can be really hard
to make sure that you’re_not over-
reserving. The implementation of
the new system will make things
clearer, and that will be a huge
help in itself,” Malekoff said.

The reservation system cur-
rently in place is run by software
called R25, which lists the all the
rooms and buildings within the
University. A student can request
a room through the software on-
line, and workers -at the reserva-
tions desk will conﬁrm whether
or not the room is available

through email.

Louderback, who campaigned
in the fall on the initiative of re-
constructing the reservations-

Reservationsoftware to undergo changes

- desk process for student groups,

said that oftentimes the requests

accumulate too quickly for peo— '

ple.at the reservations desk to
keep track of them. When ‘this
happens, multiple groups can
request the same room and not
know whether they will actually
have the room for another two
weeks. '

Bonner said that thousands.

of requests are made for room
reservations each year. Fromjuly
1, 2010, through May 1, 2011,
the reservations desk received
more than 8,000 reservations,

' including requests from student

groups,‘ faculty and administra-

stationaryescalators aren’t bro-
ken, but rather ‘switched off by
students, though he could not
provide an exact number of how,
many escalators actually break
rather than get shut off manually

“Honestly, we do have stu-
dents who like to push buttons,”
he said. ‘a

Escalators can easily be
switched off by pressing the red
emergency stop button at the bot-

" tom of each escalator; however,

Kinsey said he thinks the button
is often pressed in situations that
don’t constitute emergencies.

“The majority of the time it’s
-not a mechanical issue,” he said,
commenting on the reason why
escalators around campus are
frequently out of service.

who lives in Sutherland Hall, said
he notices an escalator turned

' off at the Petersen Events Center

“more than once a week.”

After making the trek up the
ﬁrst escalator that was turned
off, a slightly winded Sigaud said
that while the unnecessary climb
certainly wouldn’t ruin his day,
“it annoys me as much as some-
thing like this can.”

When told that the escalators
are often switched off by stu-
dents, Sigaud was similarly dis-
pleased. ‘

“There’s no reason to do that.
How old are you?” he said.

If issues with the escalators
that require more than just a ﬂip
of a switch do arise, the Univer-

, sity: has, I standing maintenance

gpairs to the kinds that cars need.

“It’s hit or miss. It could be
as simple as going and turning
it back on to ordering a special-
order part,” he said.

The University only has to pay
extra for repairs in cases such as
vandalism.

Conceptually, escalators are
fairly simple: They work by mov-
ing steps on a continuous belt.
But the system requires both
electrical and mechanical com-

ponents that can break down.
In those cases, Kinsey said there
will usually be a sign indicating

. that the escalator is under repair.

Otherwise, the escalators are
shut off either to save energy in
off hours when the buildings are
locked up or because somebody
decided to hit the emergency
stop button.

For students used to the con-
venience of a ride upstairs’, that
kind of behavior can be an an-
noyance.

John Meharey, a sophomore‘

who goes to the gym at the Pe-
tersen Events Center ﬁve times a
week, said that he would probably
say “something profane,” to the
person responsible for turning off
the escalators, which he estimat-
ed to be a weekly occurrence.

But Meharey sees a silver lin-
ing around the dark cloud of a
stationary escalator. He said that
every time he needs to walk up a
broken escalator, he is reminded
of Hedberg’s jol§e,. which often
elicits alaugh. V _ --

Other students are not phased
by the extra exercise of the or-
deal.

Maria Seraﬁni, who had to
walk up an escalator in the Pete
for the ﬁrst time this semester
on Monday, said she wasn’t both-
ered by _it. '

“It still gets you up,” she said.
“It kind of sucks when you walk
up the hill, and then you’re like,
‘Sh*t.’ But it’s not a big deal.”

tion.

“One of the biggest issues is
just the fact that you put in a res-
ervation and you have no idea
what’s going on for the next two
weeks,” Rainbow Alliance presi-
dent Tricia Dougherty said.

Dougherty said that the cur-
rent system forces groups to put
in reservations for rooms a se-
mester ahead of time.

“For this semester’s meet-
ings, we put in the request [for
the room] last October. But if you
want a speaker, which cannot al-
ways be planned, there are a lot

of issues,” Dougherty said.

She said Rainbow Alliance
has had to reschedule contracts
with intended guest speakers on
quite a few occasions because the
club could not reserve a room on
time. This happened with guest
speaker Lt. Dan Choi, who came
to campus in October to speak
about his ﬁght with the “Don’t
Ask, Don’t Tell”-law that restrict-
ed LGBTQ individuals from the
military until its repeal last year.

Such problems inspired Lou-
derback to take action. He ar-
ranged meetings with Bonner
and Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey to talk about his con-
cerns with the current system
and ﬁgure out a way to implement
new software that will make the

room—reservation process more
efficient.

Louderback said that the new
system will have a “pending re-
quests” function that will de-
crease backlog. If a room is avail-

able, a student will be able to see‘

that and reserve it based on that
information.

The software will not only de-
crease the reservation backlog,
but it will also provide a virtual
set-up of the rooms. This way,

students can indicate through a .

computer the way the want the
space in their reserved rooms set
up for their meetings, instead of
writing out detailed directions.
Louderback said’, that all the
aspects of room reservations -
from catering forms to table ar-

rangements — would be taken
care of with the new software.
“The software will give you

the proper information based on ,

what room you select,” Louder-
back said.

Bonner would not comment
on how much the ‘new software
would cost.

Malekoff said she thinks the
new system is deﬁnitely ‘neces-
sary.

“I think that the changes that
are going to be made for reserva-

tions will be better for students '

and administration,”
said.

Bonner said that the new soft-
ware would allow the University
community to reserve space in
the most efficient way possible

;

and that this coming summer
would be the best time to begin
the new process.“ A ‘
“When you’re implementing
any large software program, you
deﬁnitely don’t want to imple-
ment it mid—year,” Bonner said.
The reservations” office will
take advantage of the summer
to implement the new program.
Bonner said the staff can use
those ﬁrst few months to get
used to the new software. If all
goes well, the new software will
be used in the fall forall student
organizations that want to make
room reservations. “We’ll use

p the summer term to implement ‘
it, when trafﬁc is lowest and the

staff can use it without the hustle
and bustle,” Bonner said.  '

- quality of the Pitt experience by giving students a fast,

By Matt Schaff
Columnist

 

Pitt ‘administrators take note: Bicycles aren’t that
student-friendly.

Sure, if ever touched after purchasing, bikes can
do wonders for your heart, raise your energy level
and maybe even get you those magniﬁcent glutes
that —— you were so convinced — would rake in gor-
geous members of the opposite sex in time for the
college student’s‘ traditional orgy—in—Panama City
spring break mayhem. A

But as student bicycle owners can attest, such
an account grossly warps reality. Taking a bike to
class is like having a dog "during college: Layered on
top of typical student problems, you have a_ large,
needy responsibility that you must regularly leave
unattended, except that the bike gets sick (broken)
much more often than the dog. Owners regularly defy
traﬂic law and struggle to provide unconditional
amounts of love and saliva. More importantly, the
$400 needed to acquire a machine that won’t rust
out in two weeks could liquidate the monthly budget
of someone without a job or a degree.

Students_don’t normally consider required trans-
portation fees as budget items, since they’re ﬁnanced
by loans or - if they’re lucky — loving parents. On
this campus, part of the fee pays for students’ easy

access to Pittsburgh’s Port Authority bus system,
which up until now has contributed greatlyto the

 

 

cheap and ever—available transportation alternative
to walking, and the inferior, bicycling.

And justour luck, reminiscent of 2011’s bus fund-
ing troubles, last week Port Authority organizers
announced their plans to make further service cuts
— but this time more severe, especially for students.
If the cuts go through as threatened, Pitt’s adminis-
tration had better not stand idle. This doesn’t mean
throwing in more tuition dollars to ﬁll Port Authority’s
deﬁcit; rather, it might be time for leadership.

As reported by The Pitt News, next ﬁscal year Port
Authority is set to fall short of operating funds to the
tune of $64 million, and in language that could only
be described as colorful, the public transit agency’s

' website ﬁres the blame at Harrisburg politicians.

Whatever the source of the funding problem, its result
could signiﬁcantly change the way Pitt students get

around. Here’s a snapshot of the pain: Out of 100 cur~ .

rent bus routes, 40 will be eliminated entirely, and
remaining buses will run on reduced schedules, with
almost all turning off their engines at 10 p.m. (this
is not to mention the hundreds of jobs potentially
lost, but that doesn’t necessarily relate to students
unless bus drivers are students’ relatives or are taking
classes themselves). ., . V

To the Editor,

In reference to “U.S. must get involved ”

in Syrian struggle,” 17January, 2012, Mark
Kozlowski wrote, “On Syria the administra-
tion has not said much, and very few are
advocating broader U.S. intervention. They

should b_e.f’ Kozlowski also wrote, “The U.S. 4,

should seriously consider imposing a no-fly

zone.”

Republicans are trying to cut the size of
government. The Republican presidential
candidates are all saying the ‘same thing:
The U.S. does not have a revenue problem,
the U.S. has a spending problem. Republican‘

 House Speaker John Boehner has openly
ladmi‘ttedthat the U.S. is broke and has no

money to spend. The Tea Party does not
want to increase government spending, its
main goal is to cut spending and reduce the
national debt.

If the U.S. gets involved in the Syrian
struggle by imposing‘ a no—ﬂy zone, that
military action would increase U.S. gov-
ernment military spending. If involvement
were to include ground troops (i.e., Bush

and Iraq), that would increase the national
debt and the annual federal budget deﬁcit
by a greater margin.

In the future, I wish Kozlowski would
keep his tax—increasing, budget—busting,

Most Americans’ deﬁnition of

a pizza requires a few necessities:

red and tangy tomato sauce, a crisp
and golden brown crust and gobs
of white cheese pulling into strings
at the ‘edges of each slice.

Pizza—shop devotees quibble
over which place has the best piz-
za and which style tops the rest
like they’re talking politics. And
while the pizzerias in question
might be local, the tomatoes, ﬂour
and cheese don’t sprout up in the
middle of the city. a

How does ﬂour get from ﬁeld
to dough? And what about the
tomatoes that go from vine to
sauce? And ﬁnally, what process
does cheese go through to travel
from cow to shredded topping‘?
Each pizza shop gets ingredients
from somewhere, and whether
it’s from mostly local suppliers or
somewhere a little farther — like
California — getting the right mix-

Life of Pie I

One local shop — Spak Broth—

staked its reputation not just on
its pizza, but on where its pizza
comes from. In exploring its “local,
sustainable and healthy whenever
possible” ingredients, as explained
by its mission statement, Spak
Brothers ensures its pies become
more than the sum of their parts.

Past the grafﬁti—style mural on

chines and a few seats lead the way
to a worn wooden counter and a
pizza oven that barely seems able

General Manager Cody Darling
of Polish Hill explained that broth-
ers Ryan and Nate Spak opened
the restaurant in 2008 to be a
haven for pizza lovers looking for
a healthy and sustainable choice
of pie.

“They wanted to serve a neigh-
borhood that doesn’t have that op-
tion already,” Darling said.

After working in pizza shops
for years, the brothers knew they
wanted to do something differ-

‘ ently.

“It was a reaction to places they
had both worked that didn’t of-
fer the things they were looking

for,” Darling said. “It came out

of a reaction to the lack of their
product model being available in
Pittsburgh.”

— rank high on customers’ favor—

the culture ofthe Internet    

By Skylar Wilcox
Staff Writer

The high seasof the Internet are ‘becoming
a dangerous place for pirates.‘

Several big arrests and anti—piracy leg-
islation such as the Stop Online Piracy Act
and PROTECT IP Act are threatening not
only copyright violators, but many Internet
conventions as well. All of this could have
an effect on the way people share and create

' online. But accordingto industry giants .
like the Recording Industry" Association‘
of America, these bills could help legal '

media industries ﬂourish and allow space
for new talents. ‘

SOPA and PIPA are similar bills current-
ly in the House and Senate, respectively.
Both bills are intended to limit copyright
infringement on the Web by shutting down
sites providing links to pirated material.

The bills have met considerable resis-
tance-in the technological community, forc-

- 'ing many of their supporters to reconsider

the backings. “Rather than prematurely
bringing the PROTECT IP Act to the Senate
ﬂoor, we should ﬁrst study and resolve the
serious issues that come with this legisla-
tion,” said Senate Minority leader Mitch
McConnell (R—Ky.) in a press conference.
a The bills would give copyright holders
and media conglomerates increased power

to legally pursue perpetrators of copyright ‘

infringement.

Copyright holders currently use the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act to go
after sites hosting their content. Under
this law, owners can issue take-down no-
tices to community we_bsit_es onto which
users have uploaded copyrighted content.
For instance, YouTube frequently takes
“down clips from movies or recently re-
leased songs at the request of conglomer-
ates like EMI. P .

Higher-ups in theindustry believe that
piracy has a huge impact on their business.
RIAA representatives declined to comment,
but directed all questions to their website.
According to the association’s website, part
of the consequences of illegal ﬁle-sharing
come from the fact that although the reach
of music is widespread, the industry “by
business standards is relatively small.” The

"website blames piracy issues for the loss
of thousands of industry jobs and explains
further how pirating can hurt the artists
themselves. ‘ .

“The successful partnership between a
music label and a global superstar'— and
the revenue generated —— ﬁnances the in-
vestment in discovering, developing and
promoting the next new artist. Without that
revolving door of investment and revenue,

the ability to bring the next generation of

artists to the marketplaceis diminished,‘

as is the incentive for the aspiring artist
to make music a full-time professional ca-
reer,” RIAA’s website said.

Under SOPA, even sites that comply with
copyright laws can be sued. Essentially,
any site that steals U.S. goods, has users
in the U.S. or uses copyright infringement
as a means of delivering content could be
in danger. This means that if a site such

. as Facebook is designed to‘ enable users

to shareinformation, then Facebook may
be labeled as an offending site according to
the bill because information on Facebook
could infringe on copyrights..
Technology Writer-Clay Shirky oversees

the policing of individual speech as a direct

consequence of these restrictions.

“The biggest content producers on the
Internet are not Google and Yahoo, they’re
us. We’re the people getting policed,” said
Shirky, who studiesthe effect of the Inter-
net on society and has publishedtwo books

2 on related subjects.

' SOPA and PIPA both focus on giving

copyright holders the ability togorder, .-

severe sanctions against violating web-
sites. A commonly cited analogy is that if

a store were making fake DVDs, copyright

owners would now have the authority to
order banks to stop processing the busi-
ness’s money, have the police shut down
its storefront and have the store removed

. from all maps.

Removing websites from these online
maps, known as Domain Name System
lists, has provedto be especially contro-
versial. ‘

DN S lists translate the human-readable
words like “google.com” into computer IP
addresses like “75.125.113.1o6,” which con-
nect users to websites. SOPA and,PIPA give
media conglomerates the authority to have

‘websites removed from these lists, render-

ing them invisible to common users.
“The functional setup of such site block-

ing via DNS blocking is effectivelyjdentical

to how the Great Firewall of China works.
While the intended purpose is obviously
different, the actual mechanism for block-
ing is nearly identical,” Michael Masnick,
CEO of Techdirt, said of SOPA’s technical
capabilities. Techdirt is an Internet group
that delivers news and sparks discussion
on technical issues.

The Web’s international scope means
that these measures are especially dam-
aging to U.S.—based websites. While users
in the United States will have a hard time
accessing certain sites, international users
should still be able to look upsthe sites’ ad-
dresses onunniodiﬁed DNS lists. 7

‘What concerns copyright experts like

Masnick the most is the potentialfor SOPA-

to stiﬂe free speech. He cited how the Rus-
sian government’s use of anti—piracy raids
on environmental and other advocacy
groups has allowed police to seize the work
of government critics. . ‘
“Even if the intended purpose of SOPA

. and PIPA are to protect against infringe-

ment, opening up the door to censorship
for one purpose makes it nearly impossible
to avoid it being used for other purposes,”
Masnick said.

Entrepreneurs are also threatened by
the new legislation. SOPA includes terms
which oblige sites to pay the legal fees of

suing companies if they lose the lawsuits in.

court. Since a claim under SOPA would be
able to be made over something as simple
as a link in a site’s comment section, the
resulting increase in start—ups’ legal costs
could impede their growth.

Masnick cites a study by management
consulting ﬁrm Booz 8: Company. The study
— ﬁnanced by Google Inc., which has op-
posed the bill '— found that more than 70
percent of ange_l investors — persons who

invest in start—up ventures .— would be .

deterred from investing in “user uploaded”
websites if laws like SOPA and PIPA were

tech start—ups receive are from these afflu-

‘ent individuals, theloss of angel investors’
conﬁdence might be crippling to new online

businesses.

 

them from voting in favor of PIPA and SOPA.

 

Some argue that anti—piracy tools are

strong enough without measures like SOPA.
. The day after the anti—SOPA blackout, orga-

nized last week by Internet giants includ-

‘ing Wikipedia and Reddit, the prominent

ﬁle-sharing site Megaupload — home to
the oft—student—used Megavideo + went
offline as its operators wefe arrested in
New Zealand. They face criminal charges in
the United States for the $175 million in ad
and membership revenue the site generated
while hosting copyrighted material.

This is not the only ‘case in which U.S.
companies have sought the extradition
of foreigners with few connections to the
United States on piracy charges. '

Richard O’Dwyer, a British college stu-
dent who operated the.ﬁle—lin.king site
TVShack, faces extradition on similar
charges of copyright infringement. TVShack
provided links to illegal content hosted on
other sites and had no formal ties to the
U.S. But the .net in the site’s URL is routed
through VeriSign Inc., a company based in
Virginia, and a British court found these

circumstances enough to justify O’Dwyer’s'

extradition.. A
Technology writers like Tony Bradley

PIZZA  

FROM PAGE 5

fare. A

“We’ve made a conscious effort to be a
standard hoagie shop that has these veg-
etarian items,” Darling said. “We’re not only

.for the hip vegetarian kid, but it encom-

passes what everyone wants. Everybody
likes pizza.”

Spak Brothers’ basic pizza starts with
fresh dough made from unbromatedﬂour
— wheat ﬂour lacking the “ﬂour booster”
potassium bromate that strengthens and
helps dough rise — and a sugar—free sauce
comprised of ground tomato ‘and tomato

puree. A few secret ingredients later and
it’s topped with a pre—shredded provolone-
mozzarella blend. _

“We cook it in a pizza oven,” Darling
noted as the important ﬁnal step. “Not a
conveyor oven that’s essentially a toaster.”

Instead of moving through, the pizza
must be turned to cook in the uneven heat.
The edges might come out a little less than
golden-brown perfection, but it’s all part of
the charm of a bona ﬁde hand-made pizza.

Not yet a symphony of sauce and cheese,
the ingredients are sourced from a variety
of companies that operate in the Pittsburgh
area. Darling said Spak Brothers gets its
ingredients from five to six suppliers, includ-
ing the Oakland Supply Company. ‘

“It’s about ﬁnding the best way to access

those ingredients for the best price with
the best quality. It took a while to get under
control,” he said. An essential member of
that'food—supplying team is a distributor
that deals in a variety of bulk iitefns.

Sacramento to the Strip

The Pennsylvania Macaroni Company,
founded in 1902, operates today as one of
the most prominent sources of ethnic food

in the Strip District and greater Pittsburgh .

area. It’s not one of the Spak_Brothers’ dis-
tributors, but the owners certainly know
their Italian food, even -the Americanized
stuff. ~ _ .

“By the mid 1980s, the grocery side of
our business started to go away,” said co—vice

president and third—generation owner Bill
Sunseri. “So we started to focus on restau-
rants and pizzerias and continue with the
I Italian specialty items.” 1

_ The retail shop is known for its variety
of captivatingly pungent cheeses, but the
basic pre—shredded mix back at Spak Broth-
ers offers its own intrigue into a-local pizza
practice.

“Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania
probably have the highest provolone pizza
in the country,” Sunseri said. “Allover the
country, everybody uses mozzarella, but the
50-50 blend gives it a little bite. Mozzarella
doesn’t really have any other heavy ﬂavor

. besides the creamy texture.”

PIZZA

FROM PAGE 8

I think the mega-

farms are the way it’s

going to stay.
-Bill Brittain

Though the ultimate source for cheese
was once dominated by the land of the
.“Cheeseheads,” now there’s a likely chance
the cheese is local. Sunseri said that although
cheeses traditionally came from Wisconsin,
they’re now being shipped in from Califor-
nia and New Mexico, or even made here in
Pennsylvania. ‘ ~ I
’ Flour is also sourced from the U.S., with
the “Wheat Belt” of the Midwest producing
most of Americas starchy white staple. And
from further west comes that juicy, bright
red element argued tobe both a fruit and
vegetable. A

“Most of your tomato products come-

from California,” Sunseri said. While the
Golden State might supply part of Spak
Brothers’ tomato needs, a new startup in

 fulﬁlling the rest with a hydro- .

 ponic system —I one that uses a nutrition
solution instead of soil — and tomatoes
grown only a short walk away.

Tomatoes Imported from Maryland
Avenue '

Shadyside Nursery started as a Christmas

tree operation a few years ago, but quickly '

' evolved into a source for produce grown
‘ hydroponically within the city limits. ,
“Once we ﬁgured out a location, we talked

the landlord into giving us the property, .

and we partnered up with a friend of ours

to dream up the hydroponic system,” said -

owner Bill Brittain. Hydroponics trade soil
for a carefully controlled water home and
allow vegetation to be grown outside its
normal climate. ‘ ' I '

“We tried to do basically just spices in
the beginning, but it was hard to move 100
pounds of basil a week or whatever,” Brittain

said. “So we went over to tomatoes, peppers '

and eggplant.” _
Besides being grownnear one of Shady-
side’s cultural centers, the tomatoes grown

for ‘Spak Brothers offer consistency that’s ’

not available from commercial tomatoes.

“The tomatoes have a better taste than v

those that are grown in soil because they’re
not grown in soil,” Brittain said. “Especially
during the winter, the tomatoes you’ll ﬁnd
instores are usually ripened with ethylene
gas. They do it with most fruit. They don’t

v ship it ripe, and Ithink that gives it kind of

a mealy taste.”

The hydroponics also increase the plant’s
yield ﬁve to ten times and open the possibili-
ties for a variety of sustainable practices.

» Brittain says the greenhouse composts and

collects rainwater. Though the Pitt graduate
is happy to be involved in the local supply
chain, he doesn’t think that Shadyside Nurs-
ery’s model is going to take over production
of the world’s tomato crop any time soon.

“I’m not terribly optimistic,” Brittain
said. “I think the mega-farms are the way it’s
going to stay. I think there’s a niche market,
especially with whatever you want to call
food enthusiasts —— foodies?”

But the nursery still has other areas of
business, such aspits landscape work and ‘

Christmas tree sales.

“Our angle is to do 50 things at once,”
Brittain said. “That’s the only way we’ll
make it.”

“When The Moon Hits Your Eye...”

While opinions abound as to who makes
the best Margherita pizza, Pittsburgh of-
fers numerous square—boxed varieties that
appeal to college students and native Pitts-
burghers alike. -

“You can go to Mt. Lebanon to one of the

better shops in Pittsburgh and you’ll pay
$16,” Sunseri said. “You can go to Oakland
and buy a $4.99 pie. There’s business out

-there for everybody.” .

9 -

Somewhere in between (a large cheese
pizza costs $7.49), Spak Brothers tries to
make its pizza and its shop a reﬂection of
the customer base. The walls are lined with __
art by a local painter and ﬂiers local punk
rock shows — a decor that Darling said is
connected to the customers who go in—and—
out of the hard—to-open door.

“It liesa lot in the commitment to neigh-
borhood and community, be that physical
space, a punk rock subculture or local food 1'
communities,” Darling said.

“It all comes out of a desire to be associ-
ated with and involved with the food from
the beginning to the ﬁnal product. It’s where
you’re getting it from and who you’re feeding
it to and being aware of that connection.” I

Panthers’ei

By Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

Don’t expect to see the Pitt
men’s basketball team in the
NCAA Tournament this season,
regardless of what head coach
Jamie Dixon says.

The Panthers’ loss to Louisville
was their eighth straight,
bringing their Big East record
to a miserable 0-7. After each of

g these losses, we’ve heard Dixon

\‘

foreshadow improvement.

“We have work to do.” “We’re
going to practice hard this week.”
“We need to continue working on
that.”

And, if you’re like me, you’ve
believed him. I’ve also heard
him say he’s not going to make
excuses. He hasn’t. That’s
something you’ve got to admire.

Let me make one thing clear:
The problem’-- with this year’s
Pitt basketball team isn’t Jamie
Dixon. He’s the same coach who
led previous Pitt teams to the
Big Dance, the same coach who
coached Sam Young and Dejuan
Blair to the NBA and the same
coach who’s built the Petersen
Events Center and the Panther
home—court advantage into what
it is today. '

The problem is with the team.
The players aren’t just below
average. The players aren’t just
underachieving. They’re last. The
worst. They are having a historic
season in the losing category.

Has Dixon made some
fundamental mistakes over’ the
course of game action this year?
Sure, but look at what he has
had to deal with. Khem Birch,
our “promising” ‘freshman,
transferred to UNLV. Travon'
Woodall, our starting point guard,
who brings so many intangible
skills to the game, went down

- with an injury.

 

The starting lineup has been
changed and tweaked several
times, and this is the biggest
part of the problem. Pitt has
yet to ﬁnd a solid set of ﬁve
guys who simultaneously work
well together on the court and
satisfy the requirements of each
position to be competitive within
the conference. At the beginning
of the season, I wrote an article

  SPGRTS  

ghth consecutiveloss lasol

valuing the depth of the Pitt
bench. Dixon was utilizing a nine-
man rotation at the time, and I
thought thiswas a good thing.

 7 t More players mean more
rest for the, starters and valuable

contributions from the bench, ,

right? Wrong. The first problem
Pitt needs to: address if it wants to

compete forithe rest of the season -

is tryingto  a consistent ﬁve-.
man starting lineup. It needs to be

the same guys each game, and they

needto pepper in a few reserves
when that group needs rest. » ‘.
The 3 second problem:
Inexperience. When Woodall was
out with injury, freshman guard

Johnjohnson took over. Don’t get I

me wrong, I’m a fan of Flipp, but
experience can’t be replaced by
3-point shooting and good ball
handling — two things Johnson
deﬁnitely has.

Redshirt freshman Isaiah
Epps has little game experience,
but found himself on the floor
against DePau1when he shouldn’t
have been. A situation like this,
can be modeled in practice, but
when it comes to game time
things are very different, and Pitt
lostthat game because of Epps’
inexperience.

The third and arguably the
biggest problem for Pitt has
been the team’s inconsistency.
Jamie Dixon’s team is known for

mastering the fundamentals of _

the game of basketball: defense,
rebounds and free-throw
shooting. These are the staple
ingredients for winning in the
Big East —— the most physical
conference around.

But Notre Dame, lit it up from
behind the 3-point line in the
second half against Pitt, shooting
nearly 63 percent. Louisville
shot 70 percent in the second
half against Pitt. Last season,

‘teams only managed to shoot 39
percent from the ﬁeld against the

Panthers’ stiﬂing defense.
Rebounding has always been
one of the Panthers’ ' strong
suits. Even in games when Pitt
signiﬁcantly out-rebounds
its opponent — against No. 1
Syracuse, the Panthers won the
rebound battle 38-24 —— it has
not been enough to propel the
team to victory. Points need to be

put up in other categories of play,
like offensive production.

At times, the offense has
stagnated‘ this season. The

inconsistency of Ashton~Gibbs ' *

as a shooter has hurt the team
dramatically. Gibbs scored a
career-high 29 points against
Marquette, then had, 10 against
Syracuse V and 14 against

_ LoujsviHe..i- .Granted,.-'  has
‘missed Woodall — who averages"

eight assists a game —— to ﬁnd
him for the open shots, buthis
shooting percentage in recent
games hasbeen dismal.‘

Talib Zanna will have a good. 5

game one night. Dante Taylor
will show promising spurts of
play the next. J.J. Moore will
throw down a thunderous du_nk
and make a 3-pointer early in the
ﬁrst half and disappear for the
rest of the, game. But these spotty
performances do not help. What

Pitt needs is 40 solid minutes of .

production out of somebody.

Bottom line: The Panthers
need a go-to player. At the
beginning of the season, I would
have said that player was Gibbs.
Now, I’m not so sure. ‘

In the game against Louisville,
Pitt did not get to the foul line
in the ﬁrst half —— a missed
opportunity for easy points. In
the second half of the same game,
Pitt shot 16 percent from the
free-throw line, sinking only one
out of six shots during the entire
contest.

The Panthers even battled
then—No. 1 Syracuse at the Carrier
Dome for most of the game last
week. They lost by eight points.
How many free throws did they
miss? Eleven.

Despite the team’s many
difficulties,theyhavebeenplaying
better. This is undoubtedly the
most frustrating thing as a fan

— seeing improvement without.

wins. What is the one element
that will push the team to victory?
When will come the day that Pitt
plays just that much better than its
opponent to get a Big East win?

Maybe it will be the game
against Providence onWednesday
night that will snap the team’s
four-game home losing streak.
But I am not going to hold my.
breath. I '

A GRAIN or snot

With passing of Joe Paterno, worldis left to wonder

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Joe Paterno is gone. But now
what? v
The legendary college football
coach passed away in the midst
of one of the biggest scandals in
sports history, and now his unbe-
lievable career‘as a coach"and"a’

contributorto Penn-State'Univer—’ ‘' 

sity is clashing with what many‘

consider a serious violationmof

moral conduct. .

. Herelis what we know: Pater- S
no won 409 games, two national
- championships, took Penn State

, to 37 bowl games and has coached

I’-more than 250 -players who went

on to the NFL. J J
Here is what we think: Pater-
no made a catastrophic error at
some point in the Jerry Sandusky
sex scandal. He was allegedly pre-
sented with a story that Sandusky
had been seen molesting a boy, and
he didn’t do enough to spark a seri-
ous investigation. A
Now the community of col-
lege sports, and even the wider

J group offAmericans who simply
_:§:jenj_oy»'7passing judgments, are left

tﬂljionderz What kind of man was
Joe Paterno?

_ To me, it seems like there are
only two options: either A) Joe Pa
was an incredible, life—changing

coach who acted selﬂessly for 46

years and had one serious lapse in
judgmentwe all knowabout, or B)
he fooled us all this entire time, and

the Sandusky case opened a can_

of worms about Paterno we might
have never seen otherwise. , _l

I think it’d be pretty unreason-
able to choose the latter. The facts
about the Sandusky case arejgstill
emerging, and the story behind
Paterno and what he saw and heard

might never be known.

But Paterno left behind a legacy,
and anyone who has tuned into
ESPN over the last couple days has
seen the effect he had: the people

' crying around his statue, the play-

ers, fans andcoaches telling per-
sonal tales about how he changed
their lives, and the general out-
pouring of love from anyone who

has ever met him.

MCT Campus

In 46 years, Paterno never had
a single major NCAA violation. He
urged the PSU board of trustees to
increase entrance requirements
for the university. His wife helped
tutor his players; he cared more
about what they did in the class-
room than on the ﬁeld, and he once
famously said, “It’s the name on
the front of the jersey that mat-
ters the most, not the name on the

back.”

With all this, it’s tough not to
respect or even admire the guy.
He never cheated, and he won’t
have an asterisk next to his name
in the record books. But will people

put the asterisk there themselves?”

What will you tell your kids about
Paterno? When I think about what
he did for Penn State (even though
the Nittany Lions are a natural
rival), what he did for the com-
munity and the example he set for
college athletics, I can’t help but
feel positively about him.

While I don’t think Paterno’s
involvement in the Sandusky case
should ever be forgotten or dis-

missed, I do believe he should 3

never be deﬁned by it. ESPN.com:‘l

mentioned the sex scandal in the
ﬁrst paragraph of its front—page
article on his death. Pop-culture
writer Tucker Max has been tweet-
ing about Joe Pa’s involvement in
the sex scandal since the day he
died. But the associations between
the legend-status coach and San-
dusky don’t tell the story of Joe

It might be early in their 2012-

season,“ but the ‘Pitt“n'1'en’s°"track” '

team has already pulled off one of
the most shocking performances
by any team in the country. .

At the Penn State N ittany Lion
Challenge indoor track meet on
Jan. 14, the men’s 4x400 meter
relayteam-composed ofseniors
Jermaine Lowery an_d_ Dontave
Cowsette and sophomores‘ Micah
Murray and Brycenr Spratling
— posted a stunning time of
3:07.43, the fastest time in the
world recorded so far in 2012 for
the event.

“It makes me extremely happy

and ‘-humble» at the same time,” ~ 

Lowery said of the record in

,4 Wm .. 4 ,.< --. .-. ../ -4 2 ,./ .1.-, V: ,r . ,..-V

an interview posted on thefPitt
website. ‘—‘Our coaches have been
telling us all season that you have
to have Pitt pride, so it really

; means a lot to just go out there
‘and"répresentePitt;””" 

W‘v‘That was only the second
time I’ve run together with this
group of guys,” Spratling said.
“So to set the world mark.was
pretty crazy.”

Spratling transferred to
Pitt this season from Eastern
Michigan.

"I-Iead coach Alonzo Webb,
who has been the Pitt men’s and
women’s track and ﬁeld head
coach since 2002, said seeing his
relay team break the world record
wasn’t that much of a surprise to
him. J
‘<“Ivt"s reallya testament to the
young men and their work ethic

012 world record at

and the way they believe in what
they’re doing,” Webb s_aid."‘It’s
an exciting time around here and
everyone is really pumped up.”
The women’s track team also
had its fair share of standouts at
the Nittany Lion Challenge.
Freshman Taylor Ellis—Watson
and senior Cambrya Jones each
ﬁnished in the top three of both
the 60-meter and 200—meter
dashes, with Jones winning the
200—meter dash. Ellis—Watson
was also a part of the 4x400
meter relay team that ﬁnished
second, along‘ with freshman
Xauddina Whittington, junior

Arielle Fonrose and junior
Jonnique Lawrence.
Ellis-Watson believes the

success comes from the support
every member of the team has for
each other.

“There’s a lot of competition
on the team, and we all encourage
each other to be the best we can
be,” she said in an interview.

Since both teams are loaded
with talented freshmen and
sophomores, Webb said the
leadership provided by the
upperclassmen has played a huge
role in Pitt’s success early this
season.

“On the men’s,side, it’s always I
been the twins Jermaine and .

Jerome Lowery,” Webb said.
“They are a really rallying force
and have been leaders since
they’ve been here. For the women
right now, it’s Jonnique Lawrence
and Cambrya Jones. They’re
doing a great job of leading some
of the younger girls.”

Spratling believes Webb’s
discipline and intensity has led

the Panthers to where they are.
“He brings everyone together
and makes sure everyone is on
their A-game,” Spratling said.
“He’s serious about everything
we do.” I ,
With indoor season just
beginning and a long outdoor
season still ahead, Webb and the
team have a motto that they hope
will help Pitt compete not only for

Big East titles, but also national,

«a:

recognition this season.

“Our theme for the team this
year is to get a little bit better at
every practice and meet,” Webb

' said.

“‘They’ve taken this mantra
and are really running with it.”
Both the men’s and women’s
teams will be in action again
this weekend at the Penn State
National Open. I
