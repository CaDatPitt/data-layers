Administration Makes Progress Towa

Pitt News Staff Writer
A step toward "establishing an information and referral
center at Pitt has been made by university.administrators.
The Office of Student Affairs recently hired Bob_ Firth

under the new and lengthy title of coordinator of new .

student programs and information and referral services.
According to Firth, who is a graduate student in the

math department and a three-year veteran of Pitt’s

Advising Center, his primary responsibilities will be to

redesign orientation and to explore the idea of an

information and referral center.

In March 1976, the University Senate Council Student
Affairs Committee kicked-off an investigation into the
concept of an information center, forming and charging a

special committee on undergraduate advising with the task
of inspecting such centers at other universities.

According to a Student Affairs Committee report, the
center should “assist students and others to understand
university services, policies and procedures. in order to
minimize confusion and waste and maximize productive

- use of university services, office and personnel.”

Firth said the center, which will likely begin operating
next fall term, will furnish information on nearly every
aspect of the university and related topics.

Contingent on plans for Student Union renovations, the
center will be located on the mezzanine level of the union in
a location visible from the outside of the building, much as
the Venetian Room is located, Firth said. ‘

The work stations will be stocked with “pamphlets,

It looks as though this Pitt student has engineered a convuent way to

Pitt News Staff Writer
The typical resident student at
Pitt has always been assured of

retaining his Towers room or Quad ,

apartment (providing they are
quick with a check). “

Until this year.

Now, with the advent of the new
dorm. lottery system‘, many‘ more
students have been forced to seek
bed and board via the classified
page of the newspaper.

To better inform these new
tenants, ‘the, Student Government
Board’s Legal Awareness Com-
mittee is in the process of
compiling a directory of area
landlords.

“The ﬁnal outcome is going to be
a directory for students,” said
committee chairperson Josie Gag-
liardi. “It’1l cover such things as
who to rent from, facilities, parking
and costs.” ‘

The first stage of this process
will be to conduct a survey of
“landlords and apartments in

Oakland, Shadyside, Hazelwood,
East Liberty and other student
housing areas.

Gagliardi said she hopes the
research can begin this spring.-
Costs for a researcher .and the
directory will be $3,000, approxi-
mately one-third of the commit-
tee’s budget. The committee will
be assisted by the Off-Campus
Housing Ofﬁce. ’

“If this whole project works out,
there arejmany things we want to
do,” Gagliardi said. “We don’t
know how it’s going to work out.
We only have $3,000 to work with. I
don’t know if we can even complete
covering South Oakland with the
money we have.”

The committee had originally
requested $5,700 for the survey.

Gagliardi said the directory
would be similar to a Penn State
project conducted last year and
‘added that such a list could lead to
better evaluation of realtors and
landlords-with an “approved
landlord” list as the ﬁnal outcome.

    

JOSIE GAGLIARDI

She said the directory would be
geared toward upperclassmen,
transfer, graduate and foreign

students. A copy of the directory '9

could be sent to these students with

the usual orientation packet each—

Gagliardi. .

Information Center To He|pFind

Answers To Students’ Questions

(Continued from page I)

‘In universities, by nature...
every department is like its own
fiefdon. This is not necessarily
wrong (but) there must be

coordination, communication,”

Firth said.

Although Firth said the center
must “build (its resources) on
information available from obvious
initial questions...we want to give
persons a sense of ‘get back to us if
the answer we have didn’t work
out.’ ”

Questions the center could not
provide answers to will be
researched and the information
placed on ﬁle, he added.

Part of the center's construction
is to be based on an information
service at the University of

' Wisconsin.

At Wisconsin a phone service is
available where students can listen
to tapes about particular areas they
have questions about.

But Firth, admitting that such a

I system will be incorporated into

Pitt’s information center, believes

WASHINGTON——The leaders of
Israel and Egypt took different
stands Tuesday on Palestinian
autonomy but asked Congress
nonetheless to give them the
weapons of war and trust them to
keep the peace.

Both warned of Soviet threats to
freedom around the world.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
renewed a proposal for a combined
municipal council of Arabs and
Israelis , in Jerusalem. But he

.. declared ﬂatly that “sovereignty in

“questions should be answered by
a human voice. “People very often
ask the wrong questions. It’s
frustrating to listen to the wrong
tape for ﬁve minutes and then wait
for some person to get on the line
and answer the right questions.”

Firth is also involved in an effort
to redesign freshman orientation,
which will be held June 23 to 26.

As with the information center,
Firth is attempting to design “a
feeling of connectedness, a sense
of colleagueship. “lt (orientation)
will work against the kinds of
things that cause fragmentation (in
a university),” he said. 1

He said he sees part of the
fragmentation at, Pitt resulting
from students being drawn from
many different cultural back-
grounds.

Firth compared Pitt to Harvard.
An Ivy League school, he said, has
an advantage in developing com-
radeship between students since
many of them come from the same
type of upper income level and
higher education backgrounds and

Arab Jerusalem should return to
the Arabs.”

Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin spoke separately
to senators and congressmen
assembled in meeting rooms on
their respective sides of the
Capitol. Sadat elaborated on his
statements during a brief meeting
with reporters.

Both leaders urged approval of
President Carter’s proposed $4.5
billion package of loans and grants
for Israel and Egypt. The package

thus can relate to one another more
easily.

To develop more contact among
students Firth will “associate
groups of students by where they
live in the fall to advisors and
mentors.” Students will then have
these mentors and advisors in
common and are more likely to

associate with one another since‘

they will have the opportunity to
communicate with one another
more often, Firth said.

Such a tight circle of contacts and
resultant communication will be
stressed among mentors and
advisors, he added, with the two
groups dealing with one another in
working out student-related pro-
blems and programs.

The end result of the idea will be
that students will have an oasis of
persons and groups with which
they can identify and will feel
“designed into the whole scheme

(of the university) as they should"

be,” Firth stated.

Monday.

Letters of agreement made

of arms sales credits to Egypt for
the ﬁrst time.

House Democratic Leader Jim
Wright of Texas predicted Con-

  Wanted:
A Brave Man

Councilwoman Michelle Madoff has raised some
onerous ethical and legal problems for other mem-
bers. of \,Pittsburgh city council «who accept such
prerogatives as Allegheny Club memberships and
spaces in the Three Rivers Stadium parking lots. But,
she also raises some disturbing questions about the

lobbying activities of our own university. .
’Madoff said one of the privileges’ offered to her

was tickets for a Pitt football game from Louis Tron-

Relations at Pitt. According to Madoff, she hedged

. at accepting the tickets, thentook them after Tronzo

gave them to her as a personal gift from himself. In
the end,‘Madoff had another change of heart and
never used the tickets‘, sending her husband to buy
some instead. Other complaints about freely flowing
football tickets abound among Harrisburg
legislators. A I -

Certainly, lobbying by state-related universities is
not restricted to Pitt.» State legislators have lamented
quite justifiably that the lobbyist forour sister in-
stitution receives a $50,000 a year salary. There is a
tinge of irony here, however. Legislators raise no
questions about the head state government lobbyist
for Pitt. Perhaps these representatives of the people
show more compassion for the head of Pitt’s Com-
monwealth ‘Relations Department because Tom
Lamb——a former state senator—is a past member of
their own fold. I ~

Although the tickets seem a small matter finan-.

cially, the cost of tickets, receptions and other costs
for entertaining the legislators must come to quite a
tidy sum that might have been better spent if it had
been used to support the Alternative Curriculum

' program or some other academic program suffering

from decreasing financial aid.

The question goes beyond mere financial’ con-

siderations, however. We must ask whether any
university should argue for funds on the basis of the
valuable services it offers by such mean aggrandize-
ment as giving free tickets and dinners to state legis-

lators.

In light of these questionable lobbying efforts, we
urge any brave member of the appropriations com-
mittee to ask tough questions of Chancellor Posvar
about this when he appears before the committee
next week. It will take a strong representative
because he will face the vfrath of both the university
and fellow legislators who have enjoyed the football
tickets. Still, someone should take Pitt to task for
these expenditures when it should be centering its
spending on education. The taxpayers who help sup-

port the university and the Pennsylvanian. students 
who pay their hard-earned savings to Pitt deserve no \

less from their representatives.

on the quality of proposed
programming and not on the basis
of the previous year’s‘ budget.
Perhaps before one attacks an-

other’s budget, he should at least \

examine it rather than castigate it
in ignorance.

Yet another area of developing
programs is the developing of
leadership necessary to carry out
such programs. ‘This twin area
should-be the main concern of any
student organization for it is only
when these two areas are dev-
eloped that the organization will be
most able to fulﬁll its purpose-

than that of non-BAS members at
BAS functions? Where are the
facts? ’

Engineering Student Cabinet’s
budget was also attacked. Com-
paring the 1976-77 budget to this
year’s budget without mentioning
the increase in programming by the
student cabinet is poor journalism.
From 1976-77 to the present, the
cabinet has added social functions
such as the polka party of “dubious
value’-’ plus a career seminar series
and a science fiction-OMNI series.

In claiming that IFC, the
Engineering Student Cabinet and
Panhel have “mostly exclusive
activities,” why didn’t the author
explain why these groups’ activi-
ties are more exclusive than any

that of serving its members and the
university community. "

Such development is best ac-
complished in a positive manner.
Attacking other student groups
does little to develop a group’s
purpose and  in‘ essence
counterproductive. Such efforts
wasted in attacking another stu-
dent group would be much more
wisely spent in developing one’s
own group. Building up is much
more of a challenge than tearing
down.

If it was the intent of the

Boston, Eddie Money

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Seven months ago, Boston
opened its fall tour_in Pittsburgh
Monday night, the band was back
at the Civic Arena and looking
back, the return performance was
the superior one.

There were flaws in the

I show—the arena’s poor acoustics

and lead singer Brad Delp’s vocals
were roadweary and strained on a
few of the lighter numbers—but
Boston overcame with high spirits,
strong musicianship and a fine
opening _act of Eddie Money to put
on an evening of heavy duty
rock’n’roll.

Boston’s sound is basic hard
rock, but the music is tempered by
an airy, almost ethereal strain
evolved through a deft blend of
keyboards and guitars. The
trademark sound is engineered by
Tom Scholz, 6-foot-five MIT
graduate who is lead guitarist and
Boston’s mastermind. Scholz, who
‘composes most of the band’s songs
with Delp, is to Boston what Pete

Townshend is to The Who or Jeff-

Lynne is to The 9 Electric Light
Orchestra—the key to the band.
He was in fine form before the

Tom Scholz

or Heyerdahl Lectures if on Ra II   Adventures 

By PHIL CONTES
Pitt News Staff Writer
Thor Heyerdahl, explorer, ad-
venturer, archeologist, anthropol-
ogist,. and self-proclaimed world’s
foremost drifter, was in Pittsburgh

Friday night at Carnegie Music

Hall for the premier of “The Tigris
Expedition,” a National Geo-
graphic special co-sponsored by
WQED detailing Heyerdahl’s jour-
ney around the Middle East in a
reed boat designed 5,000 years
ago.

The journey began in November,
1977, at the mouth of the Tigris
River in Iraq. Heyerdahl and his

Scholz and fellow guitarist Barry
Goudreau jammed smolderingly on
a couple instrumental numbers and
Scholz’ featured performance at
the keyboards of what was billed as
the world’s largest touring pipe
organ was outstanding.

Scholz takes a guitar beyond
chords—through those techniques
that have branded Boston as a

studio band (an image that was

proved false). Scholz made the
sound soar like extraterrestrial
flights. Highlighting the stage
throughout was a ﬂashing multi-
color light show which occasional-
ly broke into subtle, strong beams
showcasing Scholz, Goudreau and
drummer Sib Hashian, or a red
glow settling around the band.

Most of the repertoire was
vintage Boston. The band has only
released two albums to date-
“Boston” and “Don’t Look
Back”—and they played most of
the old favorites with energy.

Standouts were the title cut from
“Don’t Look Back,” “Peace of
Mind,” and “Party.” Particularly
effective was “A Man I’ll Never
Be,” which featured softer, mel-
lower sound. Here Scholz and
Goudreau switched to a subtle
sound in place of the usual heavy
artillery.

“More Than A Feeling,” Bos-
ton’s first hit single, was disap-

-pointing. Delp’s vocals were not

clear and the guitarwork was too

-overwhelming for a song that is

rather ethereal.

Despite a late start,_Boston came
to play—-even returning for three
encores.

The crowd was well prepared for
the advent of Boston by Money and
his back-up band.

Opening with “Two Tickets to
Paradise,” Money pranced about
the stage like Mick Jagger and his
vocals were scratchy. Evidentally,
they are considerably toned down
and smoothed over in‘ recordings,
but the rasp quality of his voice
enhanced Monev’s nerformance.

Sounding like Rod Stewart with

international crew sailed from the
Persian Gulf across the Arabian
Sea to Pakistan, then ‘back to the
mouth of the Red Sea.

Heyerdahl sought to prove that
the ancient civilizations of the area
could have communicated with
each other through ocean travel
and trade.

“We linked the cultures of the
Middle East, Asia and Africa, thus
proving that the oceans were not
barriers to cultural contact but
highways for trade,” Heyerdahl
said. ’

Heyerdahl had completed two
simlar expeditions previously. The

first was the Kon-Tiki expedition in
1947, in which he sailed a balsa log
drift raft from Peru to Polynesia. In

1969 he sailed a papyrus boat, the .

Ra II, from Morocco to Barbados,
thus proving‘ the possibility of
Egyptian inﬂuence in the Amer-
icas. ‘

“I did the journeys backwards,” I

he said. “The Tigris expedition
would have occurred earliest in
history, then Ra, then Kon-Tiki.”

Heyerdahl explained that the
Sumerian culture of the Middle
East andthe ancient cultures in
Pakistan and Egypt all developed
about the same time—-5,000 years

ago.
“There ‘ must

cultures. We do not yet know from
where,” said Heyerdahl. “That is

common inspiration to these archeology’s next major goal.”

Making The Pirates Marketable

By JEFF DUROSKO

Helmets, visors, bats, gloves, calen-
dars and ski caps are among the items to
be given away at various promotion days

-by the Pittsburgh Pirates this season,

according to director of promotions, Steve
Schanwald.

The Pirates. hired Schanwald, 23, to this I

newly created position with hopes that he

could help stop -declining attendance. .

His experience includes director of sports
promotion at the Air Force Academy and
student sports -information assistant at
the University of Maryland.

Schanwald said that this year the
Pirates are not promoting opening day, as
such, but promoting an - Opening
Weekend instead, '

‘ ‘If we can getalarge number of fans at
the beginning of the season, we can

-create a snowballing effect and keep the

I

fans coming back,” he said. V

To promote theopening three-‘game
weekend, Schanwald said there will be a
parade’ the day before the home opener
and free Pirate calendars at the first game
with Montreal. Governor Dick Thorn-

burgh will throw out the first pitch, and as A

a specialattraction, parachutists will land
on the field during the last notes of the
Canadian and American national an-
thems.

In addition, the second day will be

. called “Super Saturday” with a salute to

the Pittsburgh Steelers. Sunday will be
“Dave Parker and Willie Stargell Day.”
The two players will be given awards,
while fans will receive color photographs
of them.

A sell-a-thon was held March 19 over '

KDKA radio and March 20 over KDKA
television. Celebrities answered phones

{to help the Pirate organization sell

tickets.

Although promotion is a big part of
helping to increase dwindling attendance,
Schanwald said it is not the only answer
to the problem.

‘-‘We can't just give people a good time
during a give away,” he said. “We have
to give them a good time every time they
come to the ball park.”

«known in the community,

To do this,=th'e Pirates are adding more
music to the games and hiring a Pirate
Parrot mascot. “ The Parrot will be
responsible for not allowing the crowd to
fall asleep,” headded.

“We received the costume for the
Parrot and expect to hire someone soon,”
said Schanwald. “The key is to get
someone to fit the costume and the role.
We’re considering a couple of Pitt
students.” " A“

Low attendance has been blamed on
both dwindling,‘ interest in baseball and

' ‘high ticket prices. However, Schanwald

feels differently.
— “You’ve got to let them (the Pirates) be
” said Schan-
wald. “I don’t -think baseball is at a low
interest level in Pittsburgh. It’s at a low
attendance level.” I .
This year,‘ Schanwald said there are
ﬁve different‘ prices for tickets at Three
Rivers. They range froniea $1 ticket for
child 14 years and younger and a $6 box
seat. There were only three ticket prices

I in previous‘ years.

“This year marks the first time for a
reduction in._ any ticket prices,” said
schanwald, “We reduced the cost of
6,000 reserved] seats from $4.25 to
$3..25‘.” ..

Another possible cause for low
attendance are the problems of getting to
Three Rivers Stadium ‘through heavy
downtown traffic and finding parking
tfnce there. According to Schanwald, new
signs were . erected throughout the
county, directing motorists to the stadium
He added that the Pirate organization has
no control over parking prices.

“We have come up with a few ideas to
help alleviate trafﬁc ﬂow following a
game,” he said. “We’re planning to

. have some post game shows to get some

people to stay.”

According to Schanwald, to break even
this season, the Pirates must draw at
least 1.3 million fans. Last year, the
attendance was 964,667. A

‘ ‘Giving away freebies isn’t the answer
to our problem,” said Schanwald.
‘ ‘We don’t want to have to bribe people to

come to the stadium. We want them to
want to come.” '
Schanwald wouldn’t reveal his budget
but said that it is higher than last year’s
promotion budget. A
“The only limit to what you can do

promotionally is the number of dollars
you have,” he said. Schanwald added
that promotion is a key to achieving
higher attendance, but a winning team
and community exposure are also
important.

v~ Nothing‘ New In National Lampoon Show  

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

How many of you out there remember
the National Lampoon?

It started in 1972, under the august
guidance of the Harvard Lampoon, and
rapidly became “The Humor Mag-

azine,” the adult answer to “Mad.” A

It was a simple magazine then, full of
parody and less-than-serious point-of-
attack satire. But it was fun in a very
adult way, so much so that many
considered it to be almost an under-
ground Pllblication.

That isn’t so anymore. National
Lampoon has grown to be a large
multimedia enterprise. There’s still the
magazine itself, but now there's also
records (such as “Gold Turkey” and
“Lemmings”), and Radio Hour.

With the release of “Animal House”
this summer and the television debut of

“Delta House” this winter, the Lampoon
has conquered all forms of entertainment.
Even theater. . _

Sunday night the Stanley Theatrewas
host to Lampoon’s “If We’re Late Start
Without Us,” the new multimedia stage
show, which promised to - be a show
presenting the cream of past ‘Lampoon
material.

The promise was empty. There were, a
few gags that garnered belly laughs, but
nothing like “Animal House,” or even
the magazine. The Lampoon’s touch was
there, but it was a distant touch, like
“Delta House.” M

Most of the material was very similar to
“The Groove Tube” or “Tunnelvision,”
two recent movies that have parodied
television. There was a sketch on the

-Fords and Carters at home, one on punk I

rock and one on bible-thumping religion.
In short, there really weren’t any

approaches or characters that were fresh
or.new. A
Several sketches were above average,

such as therunning gag on the harassed ,

airline pilot who was suffering from bad
luck and incompetence, and being rather
obscene about it. He ﬁnally ends up
trying to land his plane in San Diego
Stadium during half-time.

The Michael Simmons Band, opening
act for the show, was hilarious because
they were so bad. When they returned to
back up the opening Lampoon number
the crowd soundly booed them.

There were good blackout gags—B_arry
Manilow, Cora from the Maxwell House
ads and Roseanne Roseannadanna from
Weekend Update all came out onstage at
various times and did their respective
routines, only to be shot down from
offstage and fall to the floor.

There was a funny ﬁlmclip on

Stephen Stills--A Dark Star

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

lt’s not every evening that an audience
gets to watch a living legend disappoint
his loyal following.

But this happened Saturday night as
Stephen Stills, looking as bad as any
nightmare, stumbled around the stage
looking very disoriented.

Stills did two shows at the Stanley
Theater and, to put it bluntly. he W35
awful.

Not only was his choice of material poor
(the missing songs included “Change
Partners,” “Bluebird,” “Suite: Judy
Blue Eyes,” “Dark Star” and “Mari-
anne”), but Stills didn’t seem to know
how to react to his own band.
He didn’t know whether to just blend in
or stand out. He seemed very confused
and uncertain, and his band struggled to
keep him propped up.

Stills did a number of stupid things that
may or may not have been his fault. He
rambled on through long monologues
before a song in a very quiet voice that,
coupled with the usual concert clowns
shouting, made comprehension of what
he was saying impossible.

As mentioned before, his choice of
material was poor. He played for an hour
and a half for both sets, saving the
rockersifor the end (“Turn Back the
Pages”), and then did an acoustic encore
(“Thoroughfare Gap”). Many left-

halfway through the second set, and.

informed sources say the ﬁrst set proved
to be no different.

The biggest disappointment was “Love
the One You’re With.” Stills chose to
have his female vocalist wait out the
words, while he stuck to backup on the
chorus. During one of his monologues
Stills told the audience, “You can’t sing,
so it’s up to me.” He put this statement
up for debate with this performance.

Stills can still play a mean guitar,
though, and he proved it at various times
throughout the show. He remains one of
the few that can take this instrument (in
his case a cordless Stratocaster) and
really make it reach out to the crowd.

‘Stills did many of the songs from his new
LP, “Thoroughfare Gap,” but chose not
to perform its single, “Can’t Get No
Booty.” Again, not too bright.

In some tunes, like “Turn Back the
Pages,“ Stills seemed to think he had lost
his identity. In this song he pigeon-
stepped around in a manner very similiar
to Elvis Costello. At other times he
roamed and stumbled around the stage
like Kiss’ Ace Frehley. Still other times
he resembled Jimmy Page or the Who’s
Pete Townshend.

For the encore the roadies brought out
an acoustic guitar and a banjo, the latter
nearly assuring “Bluebird.” As an
example of Stills’ clear thinking he didn’t
play it.

Stills seems to be at home only with
Crosby and Nash. He certainly didn’t
give the performance expected from
someone who was the creative part of
CSN as well as many other bands.

Stephen Stills, once the driving force behind Crosby, Stills and Nash, was disappointing in his two

shows at the Stanley Saturday night.

Ken Karsh Jazz Show Beniﬁts Backspace Magazine

By PHIL CONTES

The Kenny Karsh Quartet
Student Union Lower Lounge

The show might not have lived up to
the advance billing as “the finest jazz in

Pittsburgh” but the Kenny Karsh
Quartet did put on an enjoyable jazz
concert on Sunday night in the Student
Union. The concert was sponsored by
Backspace.

The Quartet consists of Kenny Karsh
on guitars, Don Depaolis on electric

KEN KARSH

piano, Virgil Walters on bass, and
Howard Bennett on drums.

The show opened with a high energy
tune penned by Walters named “What Is
This Thing Called Disco.” Next the
quartet shifted to a song from the be-bop
era, “Scrapple From the Apple,” written
by Charlie Parker. A Bennett’s drums
puncuated the complex rhythms and
melodies laid down by Karsh.

The band then played a Karsh original A

called “The Ducks of Boston” which was
followed by the classic, “My Funny
Valentine.”

An uptempo version‘ of “Rosalinda’s
Eyes” followed. The Quartet injected this
beautiful Billy Joel tune with a bit more
energy than the original. The first set
closed out with the Sonny Rollin’s

t calypso, “St. Thomas.”

After a brief intermission the second
set opened with “I Remember April” a
song made famous by Errol Garner.
From the very beginning of this set the
quartet appeared more relaxed and
confident and finally began playing as a
unit. Depaolis’ piano grew stronger and

was more of a compliment to Karsh’s
guitar.

The audience warmed considerably and
was ultimately won over by the next tune,
“My Little Mana.“ Karsh then shifted to
acoustic guitar for his solo rendition of
Paul McCartney’s “Blackbird/‘ which
has become Karsh’s» signature.

His arrangement and improvisation are
filled with high-energy riffs, a wide
variety of shifting moods and such
explosive guitar work that Karsh got a
well deserved standing ovation at the end

of this showcase number.

The rest of the quartet came back on
stage for another original Karsh
composition titled “Love Longing” which
highlighted Virgil Walters excellent bass.
The set ended with “After Burn.”
The quartet was given a standing ovation
and encored with the Benson classic
“Breezin’.-” V

The second set more than made up for

a first half that was a bit disappointing.
and while they may not be playing the
finest jazz in Pittsburgh, an enthusiastic,
satisﬁed audience proved the Kenny
Karsh Quartet certainly came close.

  Decade Spotlights New Band From The Big Apple 

By CILIA HILDEBRAND

In a continuing series of concerts
highlighting up-and-coming bands,
Desmond Child and Rouge appeared at
the Decade Sunday night, bringing their
own high energy performance to
Pittsburgh for the first time.

The band was formed in 1975.
Desmond Child and Rouge (Diana
Grasselli, Myriam Valle and Maria Vidal)
consider their music to be the heart and
soul of New York City. .

“We combine all the elements of New
York, City—its street soul, the jazz, the
hard rock—because that is what we
are—New York City,” Grasselli said.

The group opened with “West Side
Pow Wow” from their premier album
“Desmond Child and Rouge,” released
this January. The album is currently
listed in Billboard magazine.

There were solos spotlighting each

A member of Rouge; Grasselli in “Our Love
is Insane,” Valle in "‘Lovin’ Your Love”
' and -Vidal in “Main Man” and 5‘Lazy

Love.”, ~
The highlight of the concert was the

group’s performance of the soundtrack "

from the movie “The Warriors.” It was
an excellent blend of harmony, bass,
percussion and raw emotion.

The energy level during the show was
intense. It did not, however, elicit any

Apparently this did not upset the band.
a Desmond Child and Rouge remained

This added quality of professionalism,

coupled with their high energy, make
Desmond Child and Rouge a promising
young band. - I -

THE LION, THE WITCH
AND THE WARDROBE

‘The Lion’, the Witch and the
Wardrobe,’ the first‘ of C.S. Lewis’
The Chronicles -of Narnia, is a
modern parable about four children
who step by chance through an old
wardrobe closet in an ancient
country house into the strange,
fearful, enchanting fantasy land of
Narnia. Part two of the animated
special will be presented Monday,
April 2 on CBS-TV.

The story, which began as “pic-
tures" in Lewis’ mind when he was
a teenager and was written 25 years
later as a legacy to his goddaughter,
was hailed following its publication as
b “an exceptionally good new ‘fairy

tale,"' “beautifully written," “wise
and nonsensical" and “captivating
with or without its parable."

The special, produced by the
Children's Television Workshop,
keeps as close as possible to the
original Lewis text in recreating the
mysterious Narnia, a land which can
cast a spell on children of all ages,
as well as the child at the core of
every sensitive adult.

Public Triumphs With ‘F or s . .    ’ 

By MARK HOLAN

For Colored Girls Who Have Considered
Suicide/ When The Rainbow is Enuf
Directed by Regge Life

Pittsburgh Public Theater

Pittsburgh Public Theater ends its
fourth season with a brilliant production
of Ntozake Shange’s Broadway smash
“For Colored Girls Who Have Considered
Suicide/ When The Rainbow is Enuf.”‘

Currently running at the Eddy/Theater
of Chatam College, “For Colored Girls”
is a beautiful example of what Shange
herself terms a “chorepoem”—poetry
complemented by dance.

The work is a montage of twenty-one
poems and two songs about laughter and
sorrow, innocence and wisdom, fear,
hate, and love, all of which come across
as being honest, proud and spirited.

According to director Regge Life, the
play is “an incredibly personal and
private look at what we all go through in
our lives.” e

The poems are from the perspective of
a young black woman. (Shange was
twenty-ﬁve when her work first began
taking shape in California five years ago).
The transcend this, however, and take on
universal appeal.

“The beauty of the play"is that it goes

Romeo and Juliet

Shakespearean Tragedy  

beyond race or gender to touch everyone
who sees it,” said Life.

Shange’s poetry would be praiseworthy
if one were only able to experience it
through reading. It is dance then that
adds the extraordinary dramatic beauty to
this production.

John Parks, choreographer for this
production, has done an excellent job
with the movement of the play’s seven
characters.

Parks, who helped choreograph-
another recent broadway hit, “The Wiz,
said that dance “1ink(s) the various
poems and characters together.” It is a
“natural part” of “For Colored Girls.”

The characters in the play are the Lady
in.Brown, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green,
Blue and Orange: Judy Brandt, Crystal
Lilly, Panela Poitier, Freda Scott, Coral
E. Pennyfeather, Celestine DeSaussure
and Gail Grate respectively. All are
accomplished dancers and drama-
tic performers.

Each lady is spotlighted in sundry
poems and dances. The majority of the
work is a group effort, however, creating
a colorful display of words, music and
movement on the mirrored surface of the
stage.

“For Colored Girls” runs through May
6. This contemplation and celebration of
life is an absolute must to see.

Hard To Recapture 9

By MICHAEL MCCABE

Romeo and Juliet
Point Park College Theater Company

While almost no one is prepared to
question Shakespeare’s status as the
greatest writer that ever lived, how many
are able to really appreciate and enjoy his
works?

His characters deal with unchanging
issues that concern everyone. Yet they
live in a world that is now quite foreign.
Their manner of \speech, more than
anything else, keeps them distant: and
obscure. V

Those who present a Shakespearian
play to a modern audience face the
problem of how to make it ring with all
the vitality and wit the author invested in
it originally, without loosing the
audience.

In presenting “Romeo and Juliet.” the
Point Park College Theater Company has
taken on an especially difficult task.
Since the play is so well known, the story
is rather worn. It has been abused by so
many imitations and parodies that it’s
very hard to create the tragic effect the
play is intended to have.

This production, which runs at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse through April 1, is
well produced in many respects. The
costumes are elaborate. The settings,
lighting and choreography are all quite

effective. .
The performance opens with a lively
first act. The players have a good
number of opportunities to draw smiles
and laughs and they don’t miss any.
Leland Foster Gantt is delightful] as the
high-strung, temperamental Mercutio.
Mercutio is, the play’s most vivid
character and Gantt ﬁlls the role with all
the zest it requires. His witty, animated
performance contrasts nicely with the
Romeo played by Doug Mertz. .
Mertz gives Romeo the air of a doting,
love-struck fool. As Juliet, Denice Hicks

also lacks any deep gravity. Those not .

inclined to take the romance too
seriously, however, will find this Romeo
and Juliet of the first act refreshing.

In the second and third acts, as the
gloom descends upon the stage, the
performance steadily loses impact. The
tone of anger and distress weakens the
credibility of some of the actors.

As Romeo, Mertz makes the transition
from’ the lighter tone to gloom fairly well.
In the scene where he discovers he has
been banished from Verona, for example,

he displays his anguish with intensity.

Hicks, however, fails to make Juliet’s

. torment felt. As the despair grows , the

performance becomes,_ in general, less
convincing.

The fact that the play lasts three hours
does nothing to help the audience’s
reception of the third act either.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Alive at Lab Theater

By MARK HOLAN

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead
' Directed by Kate Royston ,
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater

British playwright Tom Stoppard first
‘achieved critical acclaim in 1967 when his
play “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
..Dead” opened in London. His success in
England was followed a year later when
the play opened to rave reviews in New
York.
\ Since then, "Stoppard has triumphed
with such works as “Jumpers,”

“Travesties,” and most recently, “Every
Good Boy Deserves Favor.”

As for “Rosencrantz and Guilden-
stem,” the play has become a staple of
contemporary theater repertoire and is
often used as a supplement to the study of
“Hamlet.” ,, .

Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater’s cur-
rent production of “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern,” according to the playbill,
uses a “slightly shortened, more
‘intimate’ form” of Stoppard’s play
employed duringvits first performance at

the Edinburgh Theater Festival.

The casual or first time theater-goer
may ﬁnd this hard to believe, considering
that the performance runs for a solid two

and a half hours. But two important
factors save the production from
becoming boring or tedious.

First, there is Stoppard’s clever, subtly
dramatic language. The audience is
paced nicely through the play’s three acts
with humor (mostly Rosencrantz) and
philosophical melodrama (mostly Guild-
enstern), neither of which are carried to
dangerous extremes. J

Secondly, the f leads are performed
admirably by David Crawford as

’ Rosencrantz and Christopher Rawson as

Guildenstern. ’ Both actors do well in
creating the contrast between Stoppard’s
characters which becomes the focal point
of the play.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are the
Odd Couple at the royal palace of
Elsinore, the setting for the ﬁrst two acts.
The betting games they play to pass the
time become metaphors, for both are like
the opposite sides of a coin.

Dean Hyland also turns in a nice
performance as leader of the traveling
troupe of players known as the
Tragedians. ‘

Staging for “Rosencrantz and Guilden-
stem” has been reduced to a bare
minimum, a1lowing'Stoppard’s language,
coupled with fine performances by
Crawford and Rawson, to carry the
audience through what could be for many
a very long evening in the theater. .

Movies

By JIM LEWIS

The China Syndrome
Directed by James Bridges
Bank Cinema

Nuclear power supporters will never
take as big a black eye as they do in “The
China Syndrome.”

The movie is bleak, hopeless from the
beginning, as KXLA anchorwoman
Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her
cameraman Richard Adams (Michael
(Douglas) ﬁght to play an exclusive tape of
an accident taken inside the Ventana,
California nuclear plant on the 11 o’clock
news.

Naturally, the twosome is overwhelmed

l

by an assortment of cohorts who censor
any bad news concerning theplant.

Dan J aconich (Peter Donat), the station
executive, prevents the tape from going
on the air after a suspicious meeting with
Ventana Plant public relations director
William Gibson (James Hampton).

Gibson has orders from the plant’s
owner (Herman DeYoung) to squelch all
bad publicity and call the” dangerous
accident ,a “minor problem” to protect
his billion dollar investment in the plant.

(Enter plant employee Jack Goddell
(Jack Lemmon), the tragic hero who
knows a secret no one else does about the
plant—that of what the ‘China . Syn-
drome” really means.

Director James Bridges and writers
Mike Gray and T.S. Cook seem inspired

‘by Paddy Chayefsky’s style in “Net-

work,” using the same technique of
showing multi—screen televisions and
running commercials that undercut the
important action on another screen.

But the script contains no soliloquiesor
long speeches Chayefsyk-style. Instead,
Fonda, portraying a career woman who
doesn’t want to make waves where she is
employed, and Douglas, playing an out-
spoken anti—nuclear power supporter, are
crushed under the thumb of those who
are powerful. They can do or say nothing
to inform the populace of the dangers
they suspect.

Fonda and Douglas act well, but in
their case, the script steals the show. It’s
not their lines and the way they say them
that is the most admirable part of the

a China Syndrome Grim Tale About Nukes and Media  

movie, but the lack of things to say to
their oppressors and the utter hopeless-
ness they face that’s forefront.

Lemmon is the only -troubled character
who is able to cry out, and his

. performance is excellent.

Bridges, Gray. and Cook have written a’
good script, but those who go to see the

ﬁlm shouldn’t expect an adventurevor a

mystery. The movie's message, besides
that of anti-nuclear power (which
symbolism is used to show), is the plight
of common people in their inability to
battle big business. , P

“The China Syndrome” has bright
spots in the acting and a good script, but
it’s a cheerless, grim tale that will leave
the audience feeling; hopeless.

I-lancock,Corea Team For Live JazzSet

An Evening With Herbie Hancock and
Chick Corea
Columbia

The double album, “An Evening With

Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea,”
features the two jazz giants and is a
masterpiece, an album that will be
cherished as a classic for years to come.

The album was recorded from a series

Pointer Sisters--Changed

“Energy”
The Pointer Sisters
Electra/ Asylum

The Pointer Sisters have rechanneled
their energy.

Gone are the garish 19405 custumes I

and repertoire of big band tunes that
were characteristic of the group when
they first hit the night club circuit a few
years back.

Instead, the Pointer Sisters have
concentrated on putting energy into the
area in which they excel—harmonized
vocals——and have produced a good
quality album, aptly titled “Energy.”

All of the cuts on this album are
remakes of earlier releases, and all do the
original versions justice.

Particularly fine is Kenny Loggins’ and

Jim Messina’s “Angry Eyes” and
“Everybody is A Star” by Sly and The
Family Stone. On both these cuts the
Pointers’ vocals are tight, well-
synchronized and pleasant.

“Happiness” by Allen Toussaint has a
heavy disco beat. However, the vocals
here override any weighty, mesmerizing
percussion and “Happiness” is the best
on the album.

The only disappointing song is Bruce
Springsteen’s “Fire.” Anyone‘ who has
seen Springsteen do this piece in concert
will miss the teasing sensuality that
Springsteen captures with his vocals and
the Pointers miss.

It’s good to see the Pointer Sisters put

more energy into making strong vocal.

arrangements their trademark.

War ’s Rabb Debuts

Street Angel
Luther Rabb
MCA Records

“Street Angel” constitutes Luther
Rabb’s debut as a solo artist after
recently completing an album with War.
Rabb is no newcomer to popular music.
He has produced four albums with
Ball-N-Jack, a funk, blues group he
founded, as well as playing bass with
Santana.

“Street Angel" is rich in blues. funk
and some rock ‘n’ roll, delightfully done
with an accent on the disco beat. The
album is arranged particularly well and at

‘times sounds unmistakably like Earth,

Wind and Fire. Rabb’s vocals are suited
perfectly to the material and he receives
excellent back-up support from over a
dozen background vocalists. All the
material on “Street Angel,” with the
exception of one cut, was composed by
Rabb.

Blaring horns open the first side on a
cut titled “Whatever.” Following are a
couple of funky, up-tempo numbers,
titled, “Make a Little Move” and “No
Bandido.” Both are excellent and
showcase Rabb’s premiere bass and
vocal work.

Finishing up side one isperhaps the
album’s standout track titled appropriate-
ly, “Seattle’s Disco Groovin’ Tonight.”

. The music on side one is brisk with a good

dance beat, but Rabb’s style is
culminated in this particular cut.

Side two opens with an instrumental
titled “Boy Meets Girl,” which serves as
an introduction for the excellent blues
number “Every Day Love."

Showcasing Rabb’s versatility is an
easy-listening cut titled “Let Me Be Your
Friend," forming a nice contrast to the
other material. Finishing up the album
are three up-tempo soul tunes titled, “It’s
Live Over Here," “Square Dance” and
“Street Angels."

Rabb handles all lead vocals as well as I

the bass guitar work. Backing him up are
Ronnie Hammon on drums, Robert
Palmer on lead guitar, Joe Clark on
rhythm guitar with Luis Cabasa playing
keyboards and Reggie Bobo on percus-
sion.

release and is sure to please any fan of
funk and disco.

Peaks, Valleys, Honky Tonks and Alleys
Michael Murphey.
Epic Records

“Peaks, Valleys, Honky Tonks and
Alleys” may well be considered Michael
Murphey’s best effort to date. Anything
a fan could want is here and every cut is
vintage Murphey. Murphey has
maintained a considerable cult following
for some time but this release should give
him the widespread credit and recogni-
tion he deserves.

The album contains some blue grass,
rock ‘n’ roll, easy-listening and a
sprinkling of blues. Murphey composed
eight of the album’s eleven selections.

“Peaks, Valleys, Honky Tonks and
Alleys” is not without its share of guest
stars. Auxiliary Byrd’s member Doug
Dillard, Tim Schmit of the Eagles, Dan
Dugmore, Katy. Moffatt and Bobby
Kimball are all heard.

Side one was recorded live at the
Palomino Club in North Hollywood. It
opens with a bouncy rocker, titled
“Cosmic Cowboy/Cosmic Breakdown.”
Following is another rocker, “Another
Cheap Western/ Western Movies." Next
is a down-home, country rocker titled
“Years Behind Bars.” Particularly
notable is the ﬁddle work by Byron
Berline. ‘

“Backslider’s Wine” is an easy-listen-
ing track about the undesireable effects
back-country moonshine wine illicits.
Side one closes with “Geronomo’s
Cadillac” a light-hearted tune about
injustices done to the Indian.

Side two opens with an easy-listening
number about a mysterious card game in
which the prize is a reluctant bride.
Following is the early sixties tune by Sam
Cooke title “Chain Gang.”

“Once a Drifter” is quite possibly the
best easy-listening piece Murphey has
ever written and is one of this album’s
best cuts. Concluding “Peaks, Valleys.
Honky Tonks and Alleys” are a couple
more easy-listening tracks called “Texas
Morning” and“ Lightning." The album
is very good overall and fans should find
it extremely appealing. ‘

Hancock and Corea chase each other up

‘moments of communication verging on

communion. They are able to read
each other’s mind and musical direction
in a way that will have the listener

but this‘ album is guaranteed to excite jazz
fans and certainly never will bore.

Highlights are hard to pick on an album
filled with standout numbers but
“Someday My Prince Will Come,”
Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage” and Coreas
“La Fiesta” are perhaps the best
arrangements.

Other cuts include Gershwin’s “Liza,”
and Hancock’s solos, “Button Up” and
“February Moment.” _

This album is a must for any jazz fan.

Herbie Hancock is only half the energy on live jazz disc.

Gymnasts Place Ninth
, At Regional Meet

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
A top 10 ﬁnish was what men’s
gymnastics coach Frank D’Amico
said he wanted before the Eastern
regionals at Louisiana State last
weekend. He got his wish when
the Panthers ﬁnished ninth in a
ﬁeld of 28 teams, scoring 325

n points.

“We did a good job and I am
very pleased,” he said, “but when
I look back now, I see that we
could’ve done a lot better. Our lack
of depth really hurt us.”

Penn State ﬁnished ﬁrst, scoring
438 points to runner-up Southern
Connecticut’s 434. Ohio State was
a surprise third-place ﬁnisher,
scoring 430. Host Louisiana State
was fourth with 425 and Army ﬁfth,
scoring 376.

One big factor which hurt the
Panther’s performance was the
untimely injury of Bob.Besong.

,Besong hurt his wrist in Friday’s

competition and ws unable to
compete on Saturday.

“I just had to pull him out,” said
D’Amico. “But, I’m afraid it cost
the team about 30 points.’,’

The Panthers were in ﬁfth place
following Friday’s optional exer-
cises. Both Besong’s injury and
the tough compulsory competition
added to the team’s drop in the
standings.

“Army, Memphis State, Georgia
Tech and William and Mary all just
squeezed by us in the com-
pulsories.” said D’Amico. “If we
would have had the depth of some
teams we probably would have held
onto ﬁfth place.” A »

Another Panther who didn’t
compete was Cem Akisoglu, who
was forced to stay ‘home with
mononucleosis. According to
D’Amico, his absence also cost the
Panthers some important points.

Several Panthers turned in
impressive performances. Allan
Meyers had the best individual
performance for Pitt, ﬁnishing 12th
in the high bar with an 8.85
average in. that event. Besong
scored a 9.3 in thevault and a 9.0 in
the rings.

_Freshman Joe Femiani who,
according to D’Amico, has been
working at the all-around rigorous-
ly all season, had his best
all-around score this year, a 45.05.
D’Amico said Femiani had good
sidehorse (7.25), vault (8.8) and
parallel bar (7.6) routines.

‘I din’t expect for us to go down
there and pull it out like we did,”
said D’Amico. “Even on our home
ﬂoor all year, we couldn’t get some
of the scores we got.”

He added that a lot of people

important part of the Pitt mile relay.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Dwayne De Foor, possibly the
fastest sprinter on Pitt’s track

team, expects to be busy in this

weekend’s Virginia Invitational.
“I’ll probably run in the 440,
880, and mile relays,” explained

the freshman from Harrisburg.

“That’s a whole lot of work, but I
don’t mind. I just love to run.
“About all I do is run,” De Foor

continued. “During the summer, I

run three to six miles every other
day, which is a lot for that time of
the year. And when I’m not
running, I play basketball, which
entails a lot of running.”

De Foor enjoys running for the
same reason he likes playing the
piano--it relaxes him.

“It’s relaxing, plus it’s a lot of
fun,” he said. ‘I’ve been running
since the seventh grade, and I’ve
loved every minute of it.”

De Foor’s love of running has
paid off. The only freshman on the
Panthers’ talented mile relay team,
he ran the quarter mile in a team
best 48.8 seconds this past winter.

De Foor, however, downplays
the accomplishment, saying “there
are better sprinters.”

“Time-wise, I’m the fastest, but
I’m not the best,” the freshman
said. “Larry Shippen, Keith
Leckenby, Bud Cooper (De Foor’s
teammates in the mile relay)—they
have the experience.”

De Foor excelled at Susquehanna
Township High School, qualifying
for the Pennsylvania Interscholas-
tic Athletic Association (PIAA)
championships three times.

Recruited by national track
power Villanova, Penn State, Ohio
State, and Clemson, _De Foor chose

Pitt, he said, because it had the.)

best psychology department of all
those trying to recruit him.

He doesn’t regret the decision
and looks forward to the upcoming
weekend—busy though it may be.

This is the first of a four-part
series by The Pitt News sports
writers on the upcoming major
league baseball season. Today:

The American League West

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staffwriier
The addition of Rod Carew to the
California Angels’ lineup should

, enable them to dethrone Kansas
/~ ‘City as champions of the American
League West.’ The Royals, having .

won the division the past three
years, relied on their strong
pitching staff. Dennis Leonard won
21 games, Paul»Splittorff 19, Larry
Gura 16, and Rich Gale 14, while
‘The Mad Hungarian”, Al I-_Irabo-
sky had 20 saves.

Kansas city q

Kansas City is a solid team and
will be led by third baseman
George Brett, center fielder Amos
Otis and right ﬁelder Al Cowens.
But, the Royals show no major

improvements and will probably
ﬁnish a close second to California.

The Angels’ acquisition of Carew
from Minnesota should give them
the needed extra,lift to take the
division title. Carew won his
seventh straight batting title last
with an American League leading
average of .333. Only Ty Cobb (12)
and Honus Wagner (8) have won
more batting titles than Carew.

California

’ California will also rely on Don
Baylor who, last year, had 34 home

runs and 99 RBIs. In addition, the V

Angels will have possibly the best
center fielder in baseball in Rich
Miller. Another player to look for
is ex-Twin Dan Ford, a right fielder
who should give the Angels a home
run punch.

Pitcher Nolan Ryan lead the
league in strikeouts last year with
260 and Frank Tannana will play an
important role.,_His record last year
was 18-12.

Texas A

Texas is a team with a lot of
potential, but how they utilize that
potential is up in the air. Last
year,“the Rangers didn't play quite
up to their ability because of
internal squabbling. ‘

This season, their pitching will
be much improved with the
addition of Sparky Lyle from» the
Yankees. The Rangers will be
counting on big seasons from
ex-Pirates Richie Zisk and: ‘Al
Oliver. Oliver was a stand out
performer for them last year,
batting .324, with 14 home runs
and 89 RBI’s.

If catcher Jim Sundberg can
produce another hitting streak like
last year's 22-gaine run, and the
other Rangers can both keep peace
and perform well, the Rangers
could challenge for the division
crown. Right now, it looks like
Texas will finish third.

Seattle

Chicago shows very little im-

provement, if any, and will have a
real dogﬁght on its hands for fourth
place with Seattle. The Mariners
(Seattle) finished last year with the
worst record in baseball. However,
the Mariners made a big trade in
the off-season and the success of
their season depends a lot upon the
success of the trade.

Former Houston Pitcher Floyd
Bannister will play for Seattle this
year, while all-star short-stop Craig
Reynolds is gone. Bannister shows
a lot of promise in the building of a
good, young team.

Also, look for former Pirate farm

. system pitcher Rick Honeycutt to

make an appearance for the

Mariners. ._ ’
Chicago

b If‘ Chicago is to beat out the
Mariners, new player-manager
Don Kessinger (short stop) will

A play a vital role. Center fielder

Chet L_emmon and left fielder
Ralph Garr will be key players for

the White Sox along with hard-hit-
ting first baseman Lama Johnson.
The Sox pitching is questionable
with Francisco Barrios being the
only sound Chicago hurler.

Minnesota

There should also be a big battle
between Minnesota and Oakland to
stay out of the cellar of the
American League West. Minneso-
ta has little to speak of except
center fielder Ken Landreaux
whom they acquired from Cali-
fornia for Carew. The entire deal
hinged upon Landreaux, who
shows much promise. The Twins
pitching staff will be led by Dave
Goltz and Mike Marshall.

Oakland, who did little besides
getting its name in the paper
concerning moving to Denver,‘
radio broadcasts and the Vida Blue
trade should do even less this

By The Associated Press

I SALT LAKE CITY-—The Michi--
gan State basketball team will have
a\ year to treasure its national
championship and Earvin Johnson
will have a lifetime to remember

‘his magical moments in the NCAA ‘

tournament. V
Heading home to East Lansing
yesterday, the NCAA trophy in
their basket, the euphoric Spartans
still were ﬂoating on. air after their
conclusive 75-64 victory over
mighty Indiana State in the
national ﬁnals Monday night.
“We “are so elated, I can’t

I , describe my feelings,” said Michi-

gan ‘State Coach Jud Heathcote

after the school’s first national‘

title. “Right now, it is a

combination of ‘relief and elation.-'

Down the line I feel it was a great
personal goal, but right now it’s the

‘ players who have accomplished so
much.” . ,
One of those players, of course,

is Johnson, the ﬂashy sophomore
who was voted the tourney’s
outstanding‘ player. The 6-foot-8

i‘iMichigan ‘St. Celebrates

player, called “Magic” by his
peers, wound up the season with a
ﬂourish, scoring 24 points in
leading the Michigan State offense
against the Sycamores. '

He also» led the defense Monday
night, keying a ferocious zone that
threw a net around the great Larry
Bird, everyone’s player of the year.

Bird, who led Indiana State to 33

I straight victories coming into the

championship game, scored a
sub-par total of 19 points. He shot
a poor 33 percent from the ﬂoor on
seven of 21 shots and, significantly,
only had two assists.

Perhaps bothered somewhat by a
broken left thumb, Bird obviously
was bothered __more by the
Spartans’ marvelous 2-3, zone,
which Heathcote calls a “matchup
zone.” . The sturdy defense
collapsed around Bird like an
umbrella whenever he threatened
to come near the basket and made
him work extra hard for his shots.

  Angels Will Be Heavenly

(Continued from page 9)
That

Mitchell Page performs well again.

The As only real hope lies in
their good pitching staff led by Bob
Lacey and Rick Langford. Oakland
is a young ball club years away and

is, unless third
baseman Wayne Gross can make a
comeback ' and their top hitter

will probably finish last in the
West.

It looks like a three" team race-——a
good one—between California,

Kansas City and Texas with any h

team capable of winning the
division. But, California looks just
too good with Carew on their side.
The Angels will be heavenly.

Because his team includes a
group of top-quality freshman and.
many talented veterans, the men’s
track coacm Mike Agostinella is
hopeful of the upcoming track
season. The Panthers open up
their outdoor season with a meet at
the University of Virginia on
Saturday where they will encounter
some tough competition... I

The meet hosts nine teams,

including Pitt, Penn State, Westli

Virginia and the University of
Maryland along./with host team
University of -Virginia.

The Panthers will take fourrelay
teams with them to Saturday’s
meet and should be strong in each
event. The 440-relay team will
consist of Bud Morris, Dwayne De

‘Foot, Larry Shippen and Keith

Leckenby, with Bud Cooper as the
alternate. The 880-relay team is
the same, with Leckenby again
running the anchor leg. The mile
relay team will run with Shippen,
D_e'Foor, Cooper, and Leckenby.
The final Pitt relay team scheduled
to compete will be the two-mile
relay with Darren Geary, Joel.
Albers, Greg Conover and Bill
McShea. Geary and Albers are two
of the» freshmen additions to the
Panther squad. ‘

Agostinella is as optimistic about
the teams he has chosen to send to

_ this highly competitive meet as he

is about the entire season.

“I’m looking forward to the
upcoming season with much
optimism,” Agostinella said. “We.
are a very young team this year
with only three seniors leaving.
We hope to have the best season
that we’ve had in many, many
years.”

Pitt’s freshman crew includes
school triple jump record holder,
Larry Kinney. Kinney is one of the
top freshman triple jumpers in the
country, with an indoor best of
50-8. Along with Kinney, the other
freshmen that Agostinella des-
cribes as “outstanding” are
half‘-miler Albers, quarter miler,
De Foorflong jumper Blackshear,
and middle distance man Geary.‘

Individual competitors at Virgin-
ia this week include distance»
runners Randy Bailey, Gary Siriano
and Mark Studnicki. ‘

were‘ talking about the Panthers by ‘ ‘

the time they left Louisiana.

“I heard people saying, “Hey,
that team looks good,’ ” said
D’Amico. “If wewould have had
the manpower to back up some of
our routines, perhaps we could
have proven it.”

No Pitt performers qualiﬁed for
nationals, but D’Amico said that
Meyers deserves to be in nationals,
competing in the vault and high
bar.

“We lacked the depth to make it
to nationals,” he said. “When
your first guy goes up and scores
low, it’s a long, hard climb to get
your scores up.”

According to D’Amico, next year
will be the best year for gymnastics
at Pitt.

“We’re going to scare a ‘lot of
people -like Ohio State did this
.year,” he said. “We’ll— have more
of a team. next year with added
glepth. “This year was a good year,

but next year will be a great one." =
