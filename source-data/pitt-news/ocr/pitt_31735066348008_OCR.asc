Provost RhoteniA. Smith said last

a nationwide trend of dwindling,

student bodies and drops in aver-
age SAT scores of entering’ fresh-
man. v

Recent news have reported the
number of college slots available
outnumber college applications,
that college work is easier, and that
the studentsare demanding and

Smith 'denied these stories saying,
"Pitt has experienced no decline in
applications and our academic
standards are as high as ever. It's
no easier to get into Pitt than it was
five or ten years ago." i '

the arrests. who in turn notified
the ~ Quadrangle area coordina-
tor. Lottie Leisch.

Both Cohn and Leisch. as well
as the University's Office of Res-

knowledge of a narcotics arrest

into the matter at Leisch’s sug-

Embargo threatene"cl

BY KEN GORMLEY

An energy shortage is virtually
inevitable, should the Arabs carry
out recent threats to level another
oil embargo against the US, ac-
cording to spokesmen from Gulf Oil
Energy Office
(FEO). However, both sources‘
were convinced that our ‘country

‘would be much better prepared to

‘deal with the situation this year.
F EO.representa‘tive Mike.Page in

education program has scored an

‘ average of5l0 on the verbal section

of the Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) and 560 on the mathematical
section, for a total of 1070.
“We’re 150 points\ above the
averageinational SAT score (924),”
Smith said. “65 "/0 of Pitt freshmen
ranked in the top ﬁfth of their high’

school class, 92% of them came .

from the top two fifths.”

These figures have remained a-
bout the same since 1966 and are
down only a few points from the
19614 level." W

Smith said that Pitt's receiving of
State funds has had no bearing on
admissions standards. “The state
has “no control over our entrance
policy. Pitt is state‘-afﬁliated but"
not state owned, "so we have no
quotas to meet under state law."

Contrary to rumor, ‘Pitt did not
accept/everyone who applied for

Washington, DC, had no‘ doubts
that another embargo by the Arabs
would certainly create a shortage of
supplies along the petroleum spec-
trum.

"There's no way.we could avoid
shortages without Arab imports,"
Page insisted. "Should another

embargo occuir, we'll probably ‘be _“

faced with the same problems as
last year." A’ A
But with all the regulatory struc-
tures of energy whichwere estab-"
lished as a result of last year's
,crisis, Page was confident that
"‘the whole thing would/[go much
smoother. We're better equipped
to deal with it now." ’ ‘
Evincing a great degree of op-
timism that another embargo by
the Arabs would iiottake place,
Tom Walker, Supervisor of Re-
search for Gulf Oil, nevertheless
commented on the repercussions

' such an occur-ance wouldhave on

the US.

“There would deﬁnitely be a
shortage of gas and oil products,
but l think we learned last year that
we can get by using a lot less

"energy that we expended previous- ,

ly." / .

However, Walker admitted that it
is impossible to speculate exactly
how bad the shortage would be,
since there is no way to determine
‘whether another sizeable increase
in price,for crude oil would occur,

which could drastically reduce the

availability of gas and oil in the’

sense that many people would no

longer be able to afford them.

Frosh Dismissal Rumors  

BY SQSAN MANNELLA

Rumors ‘that. many‘ School of
Engineering freshmen are doomed
to dismissal because more students
are enrolled in engineering than
anticipated have been denied by
school officials.

‘ “These are false rumors,” said
_Emil A. DeLeo, director of ‘the
Engineering‘ Records Office. “We
don’t ‘flunk freshmen out.” He
explained students who don’t meet
engineering requirements are" not
dismissed until the end of their
sophomore year. “We don’t have a
quota system or anything like the

various , other nations," Walker
explained. “if you own a $200
million refinery here in the US, you
can't leave it idle. 'You're.going to
buy oil at any price."..

Walker went on, to say that foreign
oil-producing nations are acutely
aware of this fact, and might take
advantage of the situation by
raising prices drastically. Last
ycarxhe said,'lran sold oil to the US
at $4 a barrel prior to the embargo,
but lbegan auctioning her oil at $17
per barrel and up after the Arabs
cut off American supplies.

-T he spokesman from Gulf Oil
summarized the price situatior/. by
concluding that “there’s just no
way ' of predicting what these
countries are going to do_. There’s
a chance that they will act more

i favorably towards us due to the role

of the US in ending the Mid-East
conflict, but it’-s really too hard_ to
speculate,” he said. “We won’t be
able ii to determine. these factors

until another embargo is‘ actually .

put into effect...if_ it is put. into
effect." . .

S Walker explained that the severity
of 'tl'!c.-' .~::-ngery shortage would also
depend heavily on whether or not
the US experienced a severe ‘win-
ter. Should this occur, oil reﬁner-
ies would, be ‘forced to_ gear
production to the output of heating
oil, almost ignoring the needs for
gas and fuel oil.
Walker, this is exactly what occur-
ed, in the winter of 1972, enabling
the Arabs to take advantage of the

lack of sufficient fuel supplies with’ '

the embargo of 1973. A ‘

Inflation, shrinking enrollments

Pa. Schools Survive Crisis

AP - Soaring inﬂation and
shrinking enrollments have pushed
many of the nation’s independent
colleges to the brink of financial
ruin, but educators say Pennsyl-
vania's schools have managed to
survive the blitz for the moment.

“Pennsylvania is unique in the
number of private schools it has,
their strength and long history,”
says F. K. Miller, president of the
Commission for Independent Col-
leges and Universities of Pennsyl-
vania.

“But my guess is that looking
over the next five years, unless we
curb the inﬂationary spiral and ﬁnd
a way to solve the whole question of
enrollments, we may well have" a
number of our independent institu-
tions that will also be in trouble."

Miller's warning is already
apparent in projections made by
the state Department of Higher
Education. .

While this year’s figures areii’pt
available, officials predict the
number of students attending
private schools will plummet from
149,000 in 1973 to 123,00 in 1983. ‘

‘‘I_t’s ‘generally understood that
many -of our colleges could be in
trouble becauseof the drop," said
Roger Hummel, a department
statistician.

The schools’ problems are legion.
Faced with enrollment declines
because of a drop in the number of
high school graduates, elimination
of the draft. the soaring. cost of

(a US Senator must be at least 30

“there’s nothing in the law that
says a candidate for Senate must
be 30 years old.” _

Before Watergate under-age can-
didates were permitted on the
ballot, according to Adachi, and the
decision to exclude her this year
contradicted this procedence.

Watergate made the major parties
even more afraid of their positions.

education, a ﬁckle job market and
keen competition from.community
colleges, the scramble to -stay
solvent is uppermost in the minds
of administrators.

“Inflation is rampant,” Miller
said. “The electricity and fuel oil
costs have tripled in the last year
and institutions haven't been able
to raise fees to correspond to that
rise. M

“They're already very tight with
their budgets and you can only fail
to replace a secretary or put off
painting for so long before you start
to run out of secretaries and
building repairs become more
costly than maintenance,” he said.

Pittsburgh's Point Park College
came close to floundering in red ink
in 1973. Faculty members were
shocked to find they wouldn't get
their paychecks last summmer

because the school simply did not
have the money.

It was only after a severe cut in
staff and a $1.6 million whack at its
$6 million budget that Point Park
was able to struggle through. After
a change in administrators and a
revamping of its outlook, the
school is back in business this fall.

“The thrust of private education
is changing," said John Hopkins,
Point Park's president. “The wave

‘of the future is in supplementary

to

enrollments.

Among those nontraditional stu-
dents Point Park is teaching are
aviation employes at Greater
Pittsburgh Airport. The School
plans to begin in January a similar
program for workers at H. J. Heinz
Company, who will attend college
classes during their lunch hour at
the plant.

Of the 5,600 applicants to Pitt's

admitted.

“This is a pretty tough application
to admission ratio,” commented
Smith, “Though we can accommo-
date many students at our four
regional campuses, we’re still only
accepting quality students at Pitt.”

Some stories have suggested it is
not only easier to get into Pitt, but
to get through it as well. They
mention the introduction of non

traditional courses and easy grad-
ing through credit-no-entry
classes. ‘

Smith admitted there are more -

options for the student to explore,
but added that newcourses are as
intellectually demanding as the
traditional ones. _

“In chasing grades, ' students

.. often avoided courses they thought

would be too difﬁcult ‘for them,
usually because they lacked back-
ground in a particular subject.
With the new courses, the pressure
of grading is relieved and the stress
is on maintaining interest.”

President Ford’s announcement that he wants the exiled Americans -
to return home if they work their way back is the ﬁrst step. An amnesty

plan is now in the process of being formulated and no one is yet certain ,

whether Ford will support a restrictive amnesty or one with no strings

attached.

The exiles have been separated from their families and homeland.
They should be allowed to returnhome. V, ‘ .

When deciding on a ﬁnal plan President Ford should keep in mind the
circumstances that created Vietnam, and the moral issues involved in
refusing to participate in what seemed to be at the time America’s

darkest hour.

First, President Ford should free all those serving time in American
prisons for either draft evasion or military desertion. _

Secondly, the _President'has no] alternative but to grant a blanket
arrmesty that will allow the already severely punished exiles to start‘

anew in a factionalized country. _

They will be sure to experience

not only the greetings of a nation. but also they will get a taste infull of

deserving of public execution.

Abortion

Editor:

 



. 2’

We are writing to express our '

outrage at the Pennsylvania legis-
lature’s recent passage of the new
abortion law (Senate Bill 1318) over
the Governor's veto. The bill is

— only the latest‘ instance of the

state's organized drive to deny
women the right to abortion andlto
control of their own bodies. We are
totally opposed to this law and all
alws that relegate women to ’de-
pendent status. ’

The new abortion law requires
parental consent for women ‘under
18 and a husband’s consent for
married women to obtain abor-
lt endsstate subsidies of
abortions for women on welfare,
doublt oppressing poor women.
This law will force many women

who do no‘ wish to bear children to ._

do so or ‘face unsafe, illegal abor-
tions. ‘ A
The new abortion lawlis illegal

By RITA VITOLO

More than 6700 Pitt students will
be faced with graduation this April,
and for the rest ofyou, the prospect
of coping with the real world after a
prolonged adolescence can't be far
away.

, Last year, several thousand Am-

ericans facing the same situation
chose to join one of the nation’s
volunteer ACTION projects.
ACTION is the superagency
formed through the merger of John
Kennedy's Peace Corps and its

‘E if‘?! ‘o’omestic counterpart Volunteers in
_->*. i “ '

Service to America (VISTA) in
July, 1971. Today, the agency
totals more than 5‘..‘.0i"i) Aznericnas
helping the poor and needy in 58
countries, the United States and its
territories. Over 400 ACTION
volunteers are now serving in eight
programs in the Pittsburgh area.
Although ACTION has been ex-
panded since the merger to coor-
dinate volunteer service programs
for Americans of all ages through
the introduction of new programs
such as Foster Grandparents, the
Retired Senior Volunteer Program

"Forge an alliance of the genera-
tions" in volunteer programs,
VISTA and the Peace Corps remain
the best way young Americans can
do something to help. A

VISTA workers alone help staff six
community self-help organizations
in western Pe_nnsylvania, one near
Greensburg—working out of the
Westmoreland Country Conference
on Economic Opportunity and five
in the metropolitan area, offering
paraprofessional aid to welfare and
tenants’ rights, architecture, social
service, and neighborhood legal
assistance.

And in June 1972, when Hurri-
cane Agnes swept through Wilkes-
Barre, Scranton and Harrisburg,
volunteers were on the scene
almost immediately, 80 experienc-
ed VISTA volunteers brought into-
Pennsylvania from five ACTION
regions. Working together with
the communities to dig out. re-
build, and plan ahead, the volun-
teers cleaned up 2364 homes,
found public housing for 200 elder-
ly and poor persons, and removed
50 tons of mud. ‘ ‘ .

Through the University Year for

5/‘Volunteer (Services: Get   a Pie

;'«,4 __

years, the program has grown to
1700 projects on 43 campuses
throughout the nation. At Phila-
delphia's University of Pennsyl-
vania, where_the statc’s only UYA
program is located, undergrads can
find placement in law, economics,
communications, or health care
delivery projects.

And in 1973, more than 7300
Peace Corps volunteers could be
found serving in 58 developing
nations, while at the same time,
requests for volunteers came from
six new countries: Oman, Bahrain,
Yemen, the Seychelles, the Gilbert
and Ellice Islands, and Gabon.

Peace Corps volunteers sign up on
a minimum two-year tour of duty

-with ACTION, VISTA volunteers

for one year. VlSTA's receive $200
monthly living allowance, paid
transportation and vacation fees,
and a $600 taxable stipend from
ACTION on completing their tour.

When John Kennedy, one month ,

into his Presidency, created the
Peace Corps in 1960, he let loose a
groundswell of volunteer activity
that captured the American ima-
gination. The goals of the Peace

quering crusaders, with the em-
phasis heavy on commitment and
contribution. On June 14, 1971,
Kennedy summed up his message
for a group of Peace Corps volun-
teers: “You remember, in the
Second World War, Winston
Churchill made one of his speeches
—I think at Tripoli, when the
Eighth Army marched in there—'
and said: ‘They will say to you,
what did you do during the Great
War? And you will be able to say I
marched with the Eighth Army!’
Well, they may ask what you have
done in the 60’s for your country
and you will be able to say: fl
served in the Peace Corps, I served
in the US government.’ And I think
that people will recognize that you
have made your contribution.”
While nottaking the founding
rhetoric lightly, the emphasis in
ACTION projects today is on just
that: Action. Progress. Results.
“ACTION is a manpower re-
source," said Mike Murphy,
ACTION Coordinator for Western
Penrfsylvania and himself a former
VISTA volunteer in rural Califor-
nia. “Our contact with the

begun. With luck, a request for
volunteers can be filled within’ as

ACTION supervises the sponsor-

“ACTlON's goal is to Help the

anachronism?

The answer is an unequivocal no.

“ACTION is useful,” Barnes
emphasized, “Look at a trolley car;
what could be more out of place in a

. modern city? Yet it’s useful, it’s

needed. ACTION is no longer
new—after 14 years it’s hard to
sound like a new idea. Volunteer
programs have grown up.”

That same sense of maturity was
echoed in the attitude of a group of
brand-new VISTA volunteers
working with the Pittsburgh’s
Neighborhood ’ Legal Services
For them, their work as
VISTA volunteers was in a large
part a means to achieve an end.

“Where else could I have been
doing this kind of paralegal work,
getting this kind of training one
year out of college?" said Debbie
Tomaszewski, a Chatham graduate
who began working with NLS's
East Liberty branch in November
1973. “Without VISTA, with some
other law office, I would have been
a secretary.”

The VISTA volunteers are on‘

in or near the neighborhoods where
they are assigned. They ride the
PAT bus to work.

something,” said Ann Martin.

Much as been made of the lack of

TOM WASELESKI

A concert in a park was a novel
idea ﬁve years ago,.but today parks
are the rule rather than A the
exception, much to the dismay of

meadow-rollers" and tree-perchers.
South Park has had to bear several
deep scars, while Point State
Park’s days will soon be numbered
unless the trend there is reversed.
But what keeps Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley so healthy is a mystery to
me. Musical gatherings (though
small in size) occur there fairly

often and the stretch of green is in
constant use even when there's no
performance scheduled. The only
explanation I can offer is that
Schenley Park sits in the middle of
an academic community and
inhabitants of such communities
have been known to have a greater
appreciation for nature. It’s
difﬁcult to picture Flagstaff Hill
before the age of the frisbee. It’s
like_.wondering what the Ringling
Brothers Circus wouldbe like if
there were no such thing as clowns.
There were plenty of plastic disks

“Day in the Park” with McKen-’

' dree Spring and Raun McKennon.

Someone was trying to get up a
game. “Let's play frisbee,” he
said simply and precisely, and
immediately six people got up off
the grass. To the others that
stayed reclined he mocked, “Some
people’ just don’t know how to
behave at concerts.” Little did that .

There were quite a few tempers
that needed cooling, too, when the
beginning of the show was delayed
by 90 minutes in order to set up
the sound system. And never an
apologetic word was heard until the
concert ﬁnally did get underway‘.

    

 

The weather was great, the police were absent, and the crowd was for ’

As time passed and no music was

heard, the brown bags opened,-,

the cans tumbled out, the pull

widespread, but it was deﬁnitely

SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE
by Ingmar Bergman, translated
from the Swedish by Alan Blair,
199 pages,‘ illustrated Pantheio
Books .
"Our life's mapped out into little
squares—every day, every hour,
every minute. And on every square
it's written down what we're
supposed to do. The squares are
filled one by one and in good time.
If there’s suddenly an empty
square we're dismayed and scrawl
something onto it at once.”
Marianne's remark, in the ﬁlm
probably represents the way many
feel about their lives. «
The greatest achievement of this
fine ‘screenplay is the treatment of
common porblems of modern life.
Loneliness. Loveless marriages.
‘The difficulties in communicating
with others. Insecurity. Johan
says, “If you only kn_w how I
struggle _with my meaningless-
ness...l want something to long for.
I want something to beiieve in.”
Ingmar Bergman is one of the
world's best directors. He ﬁrst
received, world attention l“.' the
1950's for works like The"'3.$ei/enth
Seal and Wild Strawberries.
Although those films are good, his
later works became better as true
art replaced artiness and his scope
became more pe:'sct.al.
The increasingly spare style to
cused, more meaningfully on the
miseries of modern people, as in

films like Winter Light, Shame".
and The Passion of Anna. (Berg.-
man has also made some fine less
realistic films such as Persona
during the 60's.) , .—

Bergman’s films are all _-ex-
tremely well directed. -photo

MARIANNE: "Time and again I
think; Why do I think that I have
the right to maintain a selfish life
on my own? Do I really imagine I

have a mission outside you and the _

children?

JOHAN: We're emotional illi-
terates. And not only you and
l—praetically everybody, that's the
depressing thing....We're
sbvumally Ignorant, about both
ourselves and others...we must
first learn something about our-
selves and our own feelings.

Bergman writes about people who
are too considerate to be honest
with each other. The masks people
wear. The engrossment with
mundane everyday business to
cover emotional ‘wounds. The
complexity of one’s feelings toward
others. The intertwining of love
and contempt, affection and bitter-
ness.

MARIANNE: We upset and hurt
each other all to no purpose when
we carry on like this. And all the
barbs are still there when we get

into bed. My God, it's like lying on
a bed on nails.

Bergman skillfully avoids the
pitfalls of banality-by infusing his
work with insight gleaned from his
own life. “This opus took three
months to write but rather a long
part of my life to experience,"
Bergman writes. 1

Scenes fronT‘a Marriage invites
comparison with the work of Berg-
man’s great Scandinavian prede-
cessors, Ibsen and Strindberg. It’s

like‘ a mellower more optimistic '

Dance of Death. one scene ex-
plodes into Strindberg-style vio-
lence and Bergman echoes
Strindberg’s technique of concen-
trating almost exclusively on a
few major characters. Bergman
makes a reference to Ibsen by
having Johan and Marianne see A
Doll’s House.

Scenes from a Marriage can be
read for insights on everything
from loneliness to sex roles. Read

ing's performance although far
under his usual output. Dorsett
had to fight for every yard, as did
the other Pitt runners. and was
thrown for losses on a number of
occasions. , .

With the’ opposing defensive
alignment geared to stop Pitt's
ground attack, the Panthers were
forced to throw the football.
Quarterback BQly~ Daniels went to
the air fifteen times, completing
nine passes for 125 yards. While
the running game stalled in several
crucial situations, Daniels succeed-
ed in completing some key passes
which enabled the Cats to -at least
come close. '

The Pitt offense did a good job of '

moving the ball between the 20’s
but they couldn't handle the Semi-
nole defense when it counted. The
front. line broke down many times
forcing Daniels to flee from a large
group of onrushing linemen. And
when finally forced to kick, punter‘
Larry Swider and placekicker Car-

With Bert Jones at quarterback,
Baltimore drove to the Pittsburgh
one-yard line after Steeler punt
retumer'Lynn Swann lost a fumble
at the Pittsburgh 31-yard line on
the opening play of the second
quarter.

However. Baltimore running back
Bill Olds was stacked up on a
fourth-and-one plunge. and the
Steelers responded with a 99-yard
touchdown drive that ended when
Gilliam passed 54 yards to Swann
for a touchdown with 3:01 left to
play in the half.

A series later. Gilliam took the
Steelers 64 yards in three pass
plays for another touchdown that
came on a four-yard toss to Frank
Lewis andfollowed a 40-yard bomb
to Swann. ,

A 22-yard pass from Jones to
Glenn Doughty took Baltimore to

the Pittsburgh 18-yard line in the »

opening minutes of the second half,
but Jones’s next pass was

If that was the case with the first
goal, the second was pure ability
on Strasburg’s part, a diminutive
player who scared the Panthers
often with his blasts.

He took the ball, only a few
seconds after his first goal, and
creamed a hooking shot with his

which barely eluded goalie Bucci's

For the ﬁfth year in a row Terry
Hanratty has been traded. No, not
by the Steelers but by the local
media. Ever since the arrival of
Terry Bradshaw and now the
emergence of Joe Gilliam. rumors
have surfaced describing the poor
quarterback situations on other
teams and how nicely Hanratty
could fit in with those teams. Only
Hanratty isn’t too concerned about
those “trades."

“You’ve got to expect that

“We have three top quarterbacks

Rooney happily expounded. “I
never got alarmed about it because
I’d rather have three quarterbacks
who think they should’ be number
one rather than have no quarter-

Hanratty is looking toward the
season with optimism. Despite
being a number three quarterback,
Terry indicated that he ‘probably
would like to stick with the Steelers
this year and in future years.

“Well I'd like to be anywhere I
could help the team and if this is
where I can help, then that’s where
I'd like tobe."

Hanratty Not Going Anywhere, Yet   

VV1th Bradshaw out .of action due to" 

play in this season remains to be
seen. His only years as the starting
quarterback was in 1969, his rookie
season in which the Steelers fell to
a 1-13 record. In 1970 Hanratty
split the starting assignments with
the NFL number one draft choice
that year, Terry Bradshaw.

The ’71 and '72 seasons were
Terry's worst as far as playing time
was concerned. Lanquishing on
the bench for both seasons. Terry
threw a combined total of 33
passes. Assortedinjuries also kept
Hanratty out of action those
seasons. .

The 1973 season was extremely
productive but also painful for
Hanratty. He played in nine
games. starting four and throwing
eight touchdown passes, three of
which came on his first passing
attempt in the San Diego,
Cleveland and. Cincinnati games.

Whether or not he gets that shot *
depends on Joe Gilliam and Terry

that he is not a backup quarter-

not the mad bull in the china shop after the affair. Nor was the Pitt

 . “A win is a win is a,win is a win,” Majors retorted to reporter’s

The fact of the matter remains that you can’t deny Majors an ‘‘I told
you so.” His camp‘ at Johnstown was not productive, the weather in
Pittsburgh for the last two weeks couldn’t come close to the 90+
degree, 80% humidity in Tallahassee, the kind of conditions that will

to crying the preseason blues, that is. Paterno would make excuses for
the Miami "Dolphins if he were their coach. But this year at State
College Paterno just might be in a situation he hasn’t seen for a few
years. PSU’s win over Stanford Saturday, with the help of the men in
the striped shirts, was evidence enough Paterno doesn’t have the
horses.

The Pitt offensive line, with little experience other than Reynold
Stoner and Mike Carey. must play on a live and learn (basis. It was
literally three cheers for the defense by the offensive unit in the locker
room after thegame.

But if anybody is taking Saturday’s performance calmly,it is the more
experienced members of the offense.

“Between the 20's we were hell,” Carey said- “We didn’t choke, but

we don’t have that -killer instinct yet. Last year we surprised a lot of
teams.We played on a lot of psyche. This year we're more
business-like, but that’s not saying we can’t get up for a game. There
are some teams you naturally get psyched for.” ,

With an offensive repetoire of just 10 basic plays, it seems Majors
has spent a great deal of the preseason deciding just who can handle
the chores of blocking for the glory runners. Now that he has ﬁlled the
spots, at least temporariy, we can only wait tosee if experience can
make up for what psyche can’t. '

Carson Long, who missed an extra point and two of three ‘field goal

7.attempts, could only look at his performance from the bright side, ala

Johnny Majors, saying,“I made the one that counted the most;that’s

all I'm thinking about." Majors and his staff did not have any films of '

FSU in action last year and only scouted their spring game, hence
some members of the offensive line adr/nitted coming up against some
defensive formations they were not expecting‘. Majors claimed
Florida State “was physically better up front” than he had expected.
