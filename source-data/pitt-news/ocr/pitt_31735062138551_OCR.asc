.'out: this year. ; Final ;_ decision ' 
made at the University Publication‘
. Board meeting -last" Wednesday. _
It was fe.a_red.that due to the 
..difop in‘ enrollment at the Univer-' ‘
 sity,‘_the subs‘c_‘ription taken could ,
not ﬁnanceithe book. The student 2
i  proved, to the coml'nitte__e

. front page of .-The Pitt"News of '
A October 15, and‘ through their rep; ,
Hresentatives in student organiza-
, tions that not only did theywant
a yearbook, but also that they
would support it almost to a man.
The only answer to this ﬁnancial
problem‘ rests ‘notwith the faculty
or the stafl’, but-with the student
body. The price and size of the book
will remain the same; the quality,
according to Viola Boydjieﬁi, the
Editor, will be better than ever.
. Arrangements are being made
for the photographer to come to the
campus to take the students’ pic-
tures rather than “make them go-
downtown. Every student who buys
an OWL willhave his picture in it.
The price‘ is still $3.50 for freshmen,

“We gm‘/yer itaget/Jer to r
45% the L0m"s Blessing. ”

 That is the ﬁrst line of a song which has becomela tradi-

 tional Thanksgiving hymn. And tomorrow in churches all

 ‘over America, people will gather together to give thanks and
to ask the Lord’s blessing.

This year it is unnecessary to list the things for which we
" /, can be thankful. In the first place, they are too numerous. In
. the second place, they have been brought to our attention-
.‘ throughout the year if only by- comparison with_the people in
 the world who are not so fortunate as ourselves.

 

 , We all have individual blessings and it is impossible for
 ;,-us to name them. Let us thinktoday of the blessings which
=‘_we»as students and teachers in an American college have in
 common. Certainly the blessing of education should come ﬁrst
~  ‘to’ our minds. That message on the iron gate inour Commons
f_, ‘Room is really signiﬁcant. “Here is-eternal Spring; For you
‘ii, “the. very stars of heaven are new.” Not many young people in

 

.

«T . the world today have such an opportunity.

 

_ ,5 Then, too, we can all be thankful for our- friends. Someone
al  once said “He who has a million, has not a friendto spare.”
 {O_‘ne result of this war‘ has been that people are getting to know
1,, _-.- ‘each other. «Our friendships? are no longer limited to people
a ",‘fe_,lj>01,‘I1,pnd'1'aised in our own- home towns. We are getting ac-
cquainted with people from all parts of the world. Here at
school, for" example, there are soldiers representing every
statein the union-.‘They have become'.”o’ur friends. Then,.too, .
we have the usual college friendships which will last long
.__after we -leavexthe University. For these friends, if for‘ noth-
' "ing else, weshould be thankful. -

  

   
    
   
   
  
  
    
    

  And _we should be thankful that we can gather together
to worship. Freedom of worshiplis one of the things for which
the‘ men and women in service are ﬁghting. If it is worth «ﬁght-
 for,- then we should appreciate it. Today there is a special
service in Heinz. Chapel. We are lucky to have that Chapel.
;Compare it with the log church where the ﬁrst Thanksgiving
‘service took place. . ' ‘ J '

I -» We like to gather together. Our pep rally last Friday was‘
{proof of that. We come together to cheer our team to victory.
‘We come together to sing,_ito study, to dance, to have all
‘ -'sorts of student entertainments. Part of the fun is just in the
 ~.i5eing,with- each other. A ‘ ‘ - -

Today, let us gather together and ‘give thanks. it I  Iaj’

To Speak Dec. 2

John Troan, Pittsburgh Press re-
porter, will talk on Thursday, De-
cember 2, at 2:30 o’clock, in 139
Cathedral, at the closing of the first
phase of the Pitt News training
course.

Mr. Troan, who works on the-
city desk of the Pittsburgh'Press,
will speak on “Reporting the
News.” Mr. Troan studied jour-
nalism at Penn State and has
been on the stall‘ of the Press for
several years. “Mr. Troan will
also tell of his work as a rewrite
man,” said Jacqueline Goodman,
Ed45, Pitt News trainer.

The ﬁrst phase of the work in the
training course dealt with news and
feature writing. Edith Rosenblatt, a
former Pitt student who worked on
the News and is now with the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette, addressed the
group recently. Thelast few meet-
ings will be devoted to training in
copy desk and business work. This
course was open to freshmen men
“and upperclass men and women stu-
dents interest_ed in working on the
News. The class meets every Thurs-

day afternoon during seventh hour.

“Tim” snarled nastily, snapped

peace came after Jim toted him
away from the oggling 300 couples
around the band stand and shoved
him into a crate which was at least
away from the maddening crowd.

All night long “Tim” gobbled in
the Duchene garage. Also keeping

"Penny Drive”

in response to a request from .

will open a “Penny Drive” on De-
cember 6 under the direction of '
ESGC. The drive, to be co-chair- V
manned by Anne Pascasio, C46,...
and Bill Catrow, C, will continue
through December 17..

“' University students and faculty

will be mquested to exchange their‘ »._‘ 
pennies for coins of higher value
at the Booth to be set up on the ,_

Pitt sponsored a similar drivea ’ ‘_

 rofessor Writes Song
 f”Air Force Is A War Force”

Surprise featureof the eyening
, at the Air Crew dance last Friday
5,3, night was the introductionof a song
 written for the soldiers by Dr. James
’ S.‘ Taylor, head of the mathematics
i=;.' department of the University.

-The song which is entitled “The
Air Force is a War orce” has
' been ‘copyrighted and will be pub-

lished and distributed to other .
Air Crew schools throughout the
country. It was introduced’on ‘Fri-

+ day evening by Section_ 15, Squad-
ron B of the students stationed
~h_ere. . ,. , .

.,-, w*D'r. Taylor teaches some of the
" Air Crew students and claims that

 this song was inspired by the group

 j singing which he so thoroughly en-

 joys. He says that singing is an
'  important factor in Air Crew train-
 ing ‘,‘for it builds an, espirit de

‘,.7;.._corps and, more than that,.it gives

l " emotional release,” he continued. “It-

isphysiologically and mentally re- - '

lreshing. Above all, it gives that
spirit and dash for which the A11‘
Force is so well known.” ,

am-. -James S. Taylor
. . . wants to keep ’em' singing

This is not Dr. Taylor’s first V
musical composition. While a stu-
‘dent at the University of Califor-

’ ,. nia, he contributed three numbers
to the annual collegiate musical.

_ He was an active member of the

- ‘,:Glee Club in college and,‘ traveled '

 with the group as a song-and-
if dance man. ' _

 Note—This" "is "the sec"-

are some nations which can never

become highly industrialized. But-

‘this, in itself, again is no criticism.
Industrialipation is byno means the
ultimate test o f ‘success. Agricultur-
al nations must" likewise have con-
tributions to make to the sum total
of human‘ development. Attempts,
however, of agricultural nations to
become industrial nations by means
of restrictions onjmports must low-
er the world standards. . .

If a standard of living cannot be
superimposed from without, it does

not follow that those of us with ‘a
high standard cannot help others.
We can help by example. We can

gmalce available the research, the

inventions, the medical discoveries
that are ours. We can help with
much-needed capital. _ We can 1 avoid
legislation which makes difficult the
free" flow of goods. But we will only
be rendering a disservice if we s"et
out “to capture the foreign mar-
ket’? and introduce such devices as
installment finance for which other
peoples are" not ready.

Following his ‘statement, Dr.
Isaacs stressed the importance of
free trade and sensible limitations
on national ambition." A faréial
economic episode which happened
in the Balkans was cited as an

-example of the folly of bloated na-
' tional ‘ambition.’ The Roumanian
government was eager" to ‘make
maximum proﬁts from its oil wells
so it undertook to reﬁne its oil-
. before exportation. - ‘ ' -
“Other Balkan nations had laws
statingthat nothing but crude oils
could ‘be imported, the professor

said, "the purpose being to create

business for national reﬁneries. Ac-.
cordingly 'Roumania reﬁned its
crude‘ oil and:-shipped the product
to neighboring nations. However,
border oﬁicia-ls of the importi"ng‘na-
tions would not allow the oil to be?
shipped into theirnations until it
-had been reconverted to crude oil.

A plea for greater unity and un-

week "to AST language students by
Captain M. ‘Dorochoff, assistant

during heroic action in the Black

iTAY M-ALARKEY, Pitt’ hasketbaﬂ player ‘who was injured‘ in the
Great Lakeslgames enjoys some of, the finer thi

News ‘and Nurse Pauline sxoldaf.

Followers of "Pitt basketball have

more or less become. accustomed to
the unusual and so when Doctor.H.
C. Carlson says that “Tay is good
enough to playforme evenqif he’s
. out there in an arm chair,” you get
the idea that that might really hap-
pen.

For “Tay” is Clair/Malarkey, co-

captain of last year's "basketball.
team who led the city in scoring with
‘some-.182.points andwho came with-
in two points. of the tying the all-"
time Pitt record when he scored.26
points in the Geneva‘ game. ‘

‘ Tay, a second year dental student;
had a great basketball season last
year‘-and was headed for an even’
greater one this year, since the lift-
ing of the freshman rule gave him
an extra year .of- competition. He
was almost a sure bet for the all-
star game in Chicago. But be de-
eidedto go" out for football this
summer.

He was alsoheaded for a great

year as. a football player, despite
the fact that he ‘had never before
played. Playing at end, he snared
‘passes in a manner that had Coach
Clark Shaughnessy busy comparing
him with Don Hutson.

But he was hit at a bad side angle‘

during the Great_Lakes Game and
severely -tore the ' tendons’ in his
right knee. He hasbeen in St. Fran-
cis Hospital ‘since that game seven
weeks ago. Indeed, his ﬁrst outside
appearance was at Saturday’s— game
to which he was-transported back
and forth in an ambulande. This was

Malarkcy, Injured,’ Says 
Football W/as C VVortll it  

week from his hospital stay.

Despite the pain and the possibil-
ity thathe may have to'miss the
1944 basketball season," Tay still
«thinks playing football was worth
it. “I always did want to pIay,”_he
insists. “Although I always thought
of myself playing‘. quarterback.” .

Tay, who can’t account for

nickname for any other reason save
the fact that he doesn’t like to be .
called “Clair,” started at ‘Pitt in
1939. His sophomore year as a has-
ketball player’ was highly success-
ful in that he tossed the tying mark-
er in the tourney game with Illi-
nois. _ “I was just standing ‘in the
middle of the ﬂoor,” he reports,
“hoping no one would pay much at-
tention-Ito me. But Reddy POI‘t‘S1l'(l-.
denly threw the ball to me. I. was
scared to death .because I had just
heard of a fellow who had a chance

like that and muﬂed it.”

A But Tay made the shot, and in the

overtime‘ period that followed

scored the foul shot that‘ put the
Panthers ahead for the ﬁrst time.

According to Dr. Carlson, Tay
leached hislpeak in the last ﬁve
minutes of the ﬁrst Penn State
Game last year which Pitt won.
“Had he been able to continue at
that level,” "says the Doctor, “he
would have taken his place with

Cribbs, Hyatt, and Lucente,”

Durihg the abbrevisted Test Air

ber 17, all classes in one of the Uni-
versity buildings were evacuted to
shelter areas, unnecessarily, and
without authorization. This disrup-
tion of classes and the resulting con-
fusion could have been avoided. had
the following rules been observed:

' (1) Students, faculty, and vis-

itors within these University
buildings should ACT ONLY IN
TERMS OF THE UNIVERSITY‘
BELL SIGNALS.

(2) During the daytime and at
night, the signal to take shelter is
a series of short rings on the
bells, lasting approximately two
minutes. Shelter areas are indi- .
cated on posters provided in each
classroom. .' ' ‘

(3) The “return to work" sig-
nal during the daytime is a con-
tinuous ring of two minutes dura-
tion. At night the “all clear’? will

’ be indicated by live short rings.

(4) There are but two signals,
The first intermittent ringingin-
dicating evacuation of classrooms

_and oﬂices, and the second steady
ringing or ﬁveshort rings notify-
ing that normal activities may be
resumed. It shouldbe emphasized
again that persons Within these

This week, we are delighted to
welcome many former ROTC men
back into the fold. At various times,
we have caught glimpses of, among
others, Don Melaney, Lauri Mc-
Bride, Dick Brunck, and former
News editor Paul Pﬁschner, waiting
for elevators.

Rating a welcome too, is Lt.
Don Burland, who came home last
Thursday for a 10 day leave from
Camp Davis, North Carolina. Don
visited the Cathedral to see how
things had changed.

While Samuel Sneed was home
recently, his promotion to First
Lieutenancy came through. So it
was 1st Lt. Sneed who returned to

his furlough.

From New York, we hear that
David Stahl who is stationed there
with the Army, takes time off to
work on his Master’s at N.Y.U.
His wife is enrolled at the Uni-
versity too, and they have a small
apartment nearby-

Flight at Blyth, California, has as
yet, never seen his baby son. Pic-
tures, according to Jim, aren't very
satisfactory, and he's ‘waiting’ im-

most likely will not be before Feb-

not to waste any of his leave, Tim
ﬂew home, which took a day. His
comment about Oregon was

has gone into Primary Flight

The Heinz Chapel Choir took a

to sing with the Choir. Lou sang
their bass solo parts before he en-’
