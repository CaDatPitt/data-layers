Returns from the ‘financial cam-

paign of Canton "Christian College‘

compiled last_'Friday showed that less
than onehalf of the required amount

had’ been raised when the drive was

schedHuled"t-oend. To raise the quota
the drive has been extended Monday,
Tuesday, and ‘Wednesday of this week.
The reports from the__ various
schools Friday night showed a splen-
did response from the professional
schools, Pharmacy having turned in
$107, Mines $25, Engineering $50,
wllile Dentistry responded',100 . per
cent. Mines and Engineering contrib-
uted in‘a lump sum, through their
chest funds. , _
Contributions from the College,

School of Education, and School of
Economics, where the greatest sup-
port was to be expected, and upon
whom the success -of the drive de.
pends largely, since they constitute
such a large par_t of the student body,
amounted to less than .12 per cent of.

1

their quota. ' It is to those schools ,

that the ﬁnal appeal is being made.

The campaign is being carried on-in
the «School of.Law this week, "under
the management of Professor .T. "A.

Crane, ‘Chairman Foster hopes that .

theresponse from that school will
help materially in raising the total
amount. -  

Next week, the Evening School,
headed by L. G. Sigafoo, who will-be
assisted by Ida Neugebaur, will start

its -drive, the plans for which are un-!

der way. The Evening School has
already pledged its support, and a
generous return is expected.’

The drive .la.st. year resulted in
over ;$1700, and the committee hoped
to better that amount this year. Chair-
man Foster states, “Pitt has under-
taken something that" she must see

through. - Every student -who has put

off contributing, or who has neglected
to do so, is urgedto take -advantage
of this last day to help keep» Pitt in
China.”

for the forthcoming commencement
are expected to eliminate a consider-
able number of the vexationsanli dis-
appointments that have been made
inevitable in recent commencelnents,”
.Professor VV. H. Sllelton, marshal for
commencement stated. The bacca-
‘laureate service will be held "in the
Carnegie Music Hall on Sunday morn-
ing, June 10, at 11 o'clock. ‘In the
past the services have always been
held in one of the local churches, but,
since the number of graduates and
faculty alone is more than the entire
seating» capacity of most of the
churches within reach of the Univer-
sity, it was necessary. to make some
arrangement that would not exclude
all others. The -graduating class will
occupy the-entire main ﬂoor of‘ the
‘Music hall -and the faculty will be
seated on the .platform, leaving both
balconies with more than a thousand
‘seats,,for visitors. .No tickets will be
required for admission. »
At the commencement exercises in
the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall on Wed-
nesday, June -13, at 10:30 o’clock, no
person will.be admitted to the build-
wing without a ticket until after the
procession of graduates and faculty
has marched into the hall.‘ Each Sen-
ior will be -allowed,two tickets which
must be claimed in the office of his
school during the week of May 28, af-
ter whichany tickets remaining will
be available for the families‘ of_mem-
bers. of the ‘faculty and for -the‘gen-
eral public.” Each ticket will entitle
the holder to a reserved seat, but no
seats» will .._be held after the proces-
sion"‘h'as, entered the hall. This will
make it possible for a few persons
who have been unable to obtain ‘tick-
ets _to,b_e seated, and will avoid the
-confusion-“that resulted from obstruc-
tion ‘of aisles and corridors by the
hulldreds of visitors who could ‘ﬁnd
no seats at the last commencement.
-It has been decided to extend the
honorary appointment of.‘ ushers’ to

 CALIST

 , Ondla recent Th:ursd'ay'morning,.the

Baltimore and Ohio station echoed and
reechoed" with cheers entirely strange’
_ to its walls. Prospective passengers
were frightened for a few moments,

I believing that a panther had escaped

from the zoo. Their minds were soon

 = put at ease, however, for they learned

that it was only the combined mu-
sical clubsgof the University of Pitts-
burgh leaving for a three day sojourn

,’through the northern part of the

state.
The clubs pulled out at 9:00 a. in.
leaving all" cares in Pittsburgh, and
happily excited over the things that
might happen while they were -gone.
Hardly had the smoke of the city
cleared when groups scattered about
the car were discussing how and when
going to get girls.
- For some reason this sub-
ject seemedl the most discussed of
any. This chatter was soon worn out,
and there one
might hear the mufﬁed tingle of pen-
nies and the whispered “raise you
two” of someshark who held a; full
house. Why were they -whispered?
1_S‘-sh! Prof. Cleven was not entirely
absorbed in his game of bridge.
And so the time passed.until a
..rathor‘queer feeling prompted one to
look at his watch only to learn. the

 discouraging fact that it was twelve

o’clock. There was a. diner;/;,on the

V - ‘train, if it might be so called; but

there were ﬁfty of us and the little
section of the chaircar where we had
every reason to hope they served
meals only seated sixteen. But the

‘ parade soon started and when one re-

mained there too long he was soon
told about it by those who waited im-
-patiently to satisfy their physical ap-
petites. -

But we cannot pass on without a -

word concerning what and how we
‘ate. The chef had prepared a special
dinner for us, (it is rumored’ that it
was at Manager Kenyon’s request)
beef, potatoes,
But when it!
was placed ‘before us the problem

' ‘V arose as to how we were going to eat

it, for the cars actions were similar
to those of a No. 75 car coming up

0 Fifth avenue hill. Campbell picked up

his coffee, the fellowbeside him drank
it, and then wiped Campbell’s mouth
with llisnapkin. But’ after it was ‘all
over,-everyone felt better except the
waiter. - » ' _ -

At DuB__ois. two charming young men

. decided to. stretch themselves while
' afresh locomotive made ready -to haul
'__us over the mountains.

And so amid

who parked the observation platform,
they started after two girls who had

T justpassed. On they went, and very

sh‘5rtly, on we went without them, ap-
parently. But the clever boys had
boarded the front coach, a.nd about

- ‘a. half hour later enjoyed a good laugh

on us.

superintendent of the hig school and

" The concert was quite a success, but
the hit of the evening was Jack

~ Thaam who hammered his way to nu-
'merous encores and thunderous ap-

plause. Jack is a Bradford boy, you
know, and the large‘ audience seemed
proud to claim him. ‘ '

No less a success than the concert

' was the “good times had by all” later.

Everyone was booked for the evening
and- some of the boys for the larger
part of the early morning, In fact two

“of the‘ boys liked Bradford so well

m— ing at the unmerciful hour of 7:20

they were nowhere to be found. . But
it seemed to work for the best," for

The train consisted of an
‘engine and one car, and we are sure
that that car went to the shop after

When the train pulled into Frank-

til the decade of the seventies. Com-
petition was so -severe as to point to
the destruction of, the‘ weaker roads.
Hence, if all railroads were to be
preserved, regulation was necessary,
which was to be exercised either bi’
state or federal legislation. Federal
regulation began on a definite plant
by the passage of the Interstate
Commerce: Act of 1887. ‘
“Pooling. and traffic association and
consolidations were either legislated
out of existence or destroyed ~‘«=~by
court decision. The railroads, there-
fore, in nearly every attempt in look-
ing toward their self-preservation
were effectively blocked. By-1915 ap-
proximately one-sixth of the total
mila.ge was in the hands of the re-
ceivers.  '

“The enormous increase in traffic
occasioned by the late war saved the
day for even many of the strongest
roads. -Soon after We entered» the
war the govvernazu-ent took the rail-
roads under -control and continued to
operate them until March 1, 1920,
at which time they ‘were ‘re-
turned to the private owners as p-ro-
vided ‘under the provisions of the
Cummins-Asch Law, ‘

“The -outstanding -features of the
Cummins-Asch -bill are the‘ new p-ro-
visions made for the settlement‘ of

labor disputes, >:poo«lin»g is made legal,

allocation of equipment is sanctioned,

and steps are. taken looking toward a

consolidation of the -railroads into a

few great systems.‘ ‘This bill has the

object ‘in view of insuring ‘to r the

Americani puiblic uninterrupted trans-

portation and the preservation of the

weak along with the strong.

«couple-d with the enormous outlay of
$1.,500,o00,ooo by the: railroads in the
immediate future for equiplmernt and
trackage,’ furnish '‘us with the out-
standing features of the railroad sit-
uation at the present time.”

Dr. Girlbert J. .Rich of the Psychol-
ogy Department, will speak at » the
luncheon tomorrow.

AFTER COLLEGE‘--WHAT? A

A

—

College women some forty years ago
feltuthe necessity for continuing some

days formed an organization which
has since become national in ‘scope-
the American‘ Association of Univer-

sity Women. This unites educational:
interests of college women of 130 col-

United States in-such a‘~ manner that
they may meet socially to form new
and ‘further old ‘friendships, to discuss
all phases of .education, art, music,
law, home economics, ‘social service,
medicine, ' public health, journalism,
and ‘n fact all the branches of knowl-
edge which are classiﬁed in a‘ college
catalog. Theystudy their home com-
munities to see in whatway educated
women may be of service in adding

‘culture and comfort to the communi-

ties in which they live. They offer
scholarships to tempt talent and
genius, they administer loan «-funds to
ambitious young people, they offer fel-
lowships for foreign study that -stu-
dents may know students and colleges
in other lands, and they give teas and
luncheons and dinners and plays and
They try in
every way to interest young people
to‘ make the most possible of their

own store of knowledge after the won-
derful -beginning of college days. The
A rican‘-' Association of University‘
W en now has some 200 branches
located in every state except four in
the United States. Be-sides the many
thousands of members these branches
represent it has hundreds of general
members who are isolated‘ from other
college women «but who wish to keep
themselves allied with educational
progress. , -
The A. A. U. W. two years ago in
conjunction with college women of’
England and Callada organized the
International Federation of Univer-
sity Women which now comprises na-
tional organizations of college wonlen
of seventeen countries organized for’
the purpose of acquiring friendship
for and better understanding of other
countries, their problems, and their
people. Club houses are being estab-
lished as rapidly as possible in the
various capitals of the world. Already
the A. A. ,U. W. has one in the cap-
ital city, Washington. Negotiations
arepunder wayfor one in London;
Paris has one at 4 rue de Chevreuse;
and Brussels has its headquarters at
Maison des Etudiantes. v

If you as a college graduate, have
slipped away from college associa-
tions, these can be easily and delight-
fully renewed by membership in this
association. If you are’ just leaving
college it will give you at once a‘

educational interests with, other
women who have the same interests.
The fee is only $2 a‘ year for general
membership sent to the Executive Sec-
retary, 1634 I street, Washington,

follow-up sale of tickets for Pitt Week has been postponed until to-

I A  Is the student body of the University of’ Pittsburgh devoid of
ideas’? Certainly such a charge leveled against us has an unsound’
A ‘basis. But it can not be denied ithatwe havenbeen for a long time
apathetic and inarticulate. The‘ world'we' live in has tremendous
signiﬁcance for us. Its movements, its tendencies,‘ its events, are
-crammed full oi:"'meaning. 'Yet we have notmbeen alive to what con-
cerns. us so vitally. Perhaps, we haveideas and it is themeans of
Q-‘giving them expression that we lack. Then what could ﬁll the need

-It is for this purpose that a Student Forum is about to be or-

also bring before them speakers of prominence. Its possibilities’. as

Editor's Note:-[Bert H. Smyers, who tells
of the University in the olden, days, W8-5
graduated in 1893. .During h1s‘youth, Mr.
Smyers’ activities comprised building up an
“iron constitution” in his father's blacksmith
shop and walking 28 miles every day ‘driving
cattle to market for which he received $1.25.
He was graduated from Bucknell Academy in
1889 and received his A. B. degree from “W.
U. P.” in 1893. While in the University, Mr.

~ Smyers played baseball and football for four

years and was captain of the football team
in 1892. Since 1893 he has been affiliated
with the Pittsburgh Trust Company and at
is vice president and trust
officer of thi organization. His clubs in-
clude ..tl_ie Duquesne and the University. He

urer of the Athletic Association. He is a

treasurer of the General Alumni Association
and is 8. member of the athletic and football
-committees. As a follower of the Panthers,
Mr. Smyers. has witnessed all the football

. games at home ‘and abroad and is the owner

of‘ the‘ famous “Pitt Bunny.” Mr. Smyers’
“Pitt Spirit” is shown in that at the pres-
ent time he has,three sons in the University,

By Bert H. Smyers, ’93. .1 ..
You ask me; to write about W. U. P‘.
in the early nlineties. Well, we like
to recall.‘ those times cccasionalvly,
though a college of 120 students
seems rather insignificant when com-
pared with a university of several
thousand.  ' ‘. ~
But we had a live institution, with
most of the ‘“accessories;” and there‘
were probably more “étu.nts” and es-
capades in those days, considering the

(number of possible participantsythan

there are now.. However, I have to be
careful in giving details, owing‘ to the
fact that I have three sons now -in
Iiitt—--one to graduate 'each4'yea‘r be-
ginning this year. (_presumaIb~Iy).

When I left Marion Center, Indiana
County,’ Pa., (fourteen mli-Ies from the
railroad), at the age of sixteen, Ihad
life before me. After taking the Sen-
ior year at Bucknelil Academy I had
no funds for college. An uncle living
at Oakmont offered me a “home”; for
the first year at W~.,U. P. and by us-
my my vacation earnings my parents
were able to pay my twition and “ex-
tras.” Extras consisted of railroad
fare and a 'very meagre allowance for
‘spending, money. ‘.‘Lunch” generally
cost five cents and consisted of a half-
dozen cinnamon rolls from the old
Cyolorama bakery, though sometimes
-I ‘went 50-5!) with some _fellow who
invested his n.ickeI in .a half-
dozen overurip-e bananas (to this day
I like them over-ripe).

I, we'll remember wavlkcing every
morning from Union Station to the

- old Seminary Building at North ave-

nue__a\hd Buena Vista street—and back
again in the afternoon. Sometimes
we could catch a freight train "going
through the parks; I learned this
from my old cI.assmate*“Paddy” Den-
niston, son of thethen treasurer of
the Pennsylvania Railroad; and that
reminds me of the time I took the
freightirain alone; a. railroad “cop-
per” received me with open arms near
the Union Station-and marched me off

to the alderman under arrest. ‘The-

generous-hearted (7) cuss,'a.fter hear-
ing my story, modiﬁed" the “$10-and
costs or ten days to ‘jai=l” to $8, when
he found that was the Iast- centvl had
in the world. That was the first, last
and only -time I -have been arrested,
but it was “hard Iines.”_ Thereafter
I walked both ways, even when the
untiversityymcved up to Opbservatoryp
Hillthat winter. , »

Your readers may be interested in
knowing that the foundation of the.
“Pitt Panthers” was "laid byius as
Freshman (Class of. 1893). In the
fall of 1889 we organized the first foot-.
ball -team, though, as I recall, we
played but one game that year;
Sh«'=ldYSide'. Academy, iwithi Messier,
Mccandless and others badly defeat-

! thinkthat only three of us had
ever seen a. football; our suits were,

.homemade—tight-ﬁtting. canvas jack-

ets, old trousers cut down, stockrin-gs
borrowed from the wardrobe of our
r_nothers and sisters, with old shoes
“cleated.” Yes, it was rather .crude,
but we could tackle‘ and fight just as
hard as the modern players, and we
paid "our own expe_nses and went af-
ter W. &. J. with just as much‘ vim,
even though we were‘ unable to catch
up to them for a few years. You can
understand now why I shed tears ?6n_
the sidelines when the?-Panthers tram-
ple W. & J. colors in the mud.

That word “mud?." ‘reminds me. Of 

the W. & .J. playing field in those
days; I nevervtasted as nasty mud
anywhere, and we got plenty» of it.
You may have heard. of.George Neale

_——o,ur “Indian” who played with me‘.
‘those four years‘ (and probably sever- ~

al years more_). "That boy stood _as

_much punlishment as any. modern

player ever took, and W. & J.'certain-
ly did enjoy administering _it; fre-
quenfly we had to call! time to unpile
the huskies from George ‘and ‘dig his
face out of its self-made grave.

In 1892- we i got Joe ' Trees, Floyd
Rose, Teddy Boden and o‘thers,"and
things looked up a bit. ‘_ Our favorite
ground-gaining play then consisted of
our 131-pound quarterback (myself),
crawling between the legs of the
tackle (Joe) for 2-... few‘ yards (before
being pinned down; but you should
have seen long, lanky Teddy Boden
vawlting the line! I , »

I sent Karl Davis some o-Id cata-
logues‘Ias‘t' week an_d _I noticedﬁthé
names of our old ‘players-—Jack-Scott,

(John McGrew, Joe Griggs, Anson. Mc-

was one E. B. House from Greely,‘
Colorado; he was no “house,” but an

We had ﬁeld meets,iwith‘ W. &. J.,

made in those days by John and LOU
McGrew, Ed Mayer, Gardner Steel,

“‘co~me-out" was in‘ the boxing. tourna-

signed. The enthusiasm and success
of that event started a succession of

the tenor drum), Bill McCaffrey (the
preacher), George Neale (the |nd‘iaI'|)y
and Charlie Campbellel-gilthe colored lad
who -could stand straight and place
his fingers on the calves of his legs-

Of course we had other activities
beside athletics. We. had two Liter-
ary societies-,—“PhiIo” and “l!'Vl"Q¥”
we had: debating teams-—BilIie Gill
could delbate as well as run or play
football; we had a Dramatic Club-—
Jack Scott, Joe Griggs, Ed Goehring,

Fraternities were not permitted at
that time, though many. of us have
since become full-fledged fraternity

0  Lecture Here

Paul W. Harrison, a well known
American physician who has spent
many years in medical work at Bah-
rein, Arabia, will speak in Carnegie
Lecture hall tomorrow" evening at :8
o'clock. Dr. Harrison comes to Pitts-
burgh under the auspices of the Stu-
dent Volunteer Union, an ‘organization.
of Pitt students and their friends. who
are interested in vmissionary work,
and is giving his talk for the beneﬁt
of Pitt students and college alumni
in this district. There is no admis-
sion charge and. the general public
will also be welcome. _

His talk will center around his med-
ical -work ‘in Arabia, and the oppor-
-tunities for medical niission aries
there. Dr. Harrison, who isa grad-
uate of Johns Hopkins Medical
School, went to Arabia a" number of
years ago, and achieved such a repu-V
tation that one of the more inﬂuen-

sent for him to help him in extending
his work. This action was ‘an unusual
tribute since .c-entrai Arabia is gener-
ally strongly opposed to all foreign
ers.

The Freshman ‘tennis team will
open its ‘season tomorrow when
Grafton» -V ‘igh School will be met on
the University -Courts. The ‘team
has been handicapped. by a. lack» of
practice, but expects to make a. good
showing, nevertheless. About 30 "can-
didates preportesd to Manager Bigler.
‘Stephens. Among
those - are a‘ number of promising
ca;nd'id‘ates,' who look like future var-
sity material. - Most prominent are‘
Westfall --of Grafton High, Roup of
Schenl_ey'_High, Beatii of Wheeling,

and MoFarren of Sacramento, Calif.
Little is known of the caliber -of
the Grafton nboys this-year, and, since
the Freshman teamis also more or
less of ‘an unknown quantity, no pre-
diictions as to the’ outcome» can be
made. ‘

Next Tuesday the Panther. Cubs
will stack up against VVilkinsburg
High on the University Courts, while
the varsity is playing ‘W.’ & ‘J. in
Washington. The Freshmen of last
year defeated the Holy City -boys,

FRESHM RS
    'lllAlNlNli lﬂll MEET-

The Pitt Panther Yearlings, after
defeating the track team from Schen-
ley. High School, are training hard
for the A. A.‘ U-. meet to. be held in
Schenley Oval next Saturday after-
noon. There will be no dual meet
for ‘the Fresh until May 30-, Decora-
tion Day, when they will journey to
Saltsburg to meet Kiski. Kiski. has
-a ﬁne/lot“ of track material and
should give the Cubs a great run
forthe cup’. ‘

Among the Fresh athletes are some
real stars, one being Marion Hawkins.
Hawk is an_ all-around man, being a
stellar basket ball. player, a football
star, and a wonderful per.former. In
the later, especially, he is said to
excel, for, in‘ -the ..-last meet, Marion
scored 31 points for the Freshies.
Cowan, the dusky sprinter from
Schenley High, and now a student at
the University, is a real fellow in
the century dash.. He Will make a
ﬁne varsity runner. and probably will
clean up all in this line.

This year’s Freshman team is re-
puted to be one of the strongest in
the” history of the school, and next

very valuable men for his varsity
roster.
