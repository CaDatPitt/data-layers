One hundred and sixty-two men
have been pledged to twenty social
fraternities on the campus this
year, This total will be consider-
ably increased when many of the
freshmen have discussed more def-
initely with their parents the mat-
ter of joining some fraternity.

A few days after the Thanksgiv-
ing holidays when the exact..nun1-
ber of men pledging frate ities
this year will be determined,‘ the
final total will not fall very far
from that of last year, according

tire dean of men.

The fraternities extended five-
hundred and twenty four bids to
three hundred and fifty-eight fresh-
men this year. Many of these first-
year,, men -have been willing to

matter up with their parents; so
they have been asked to discuss
it thoroughly with their parents be-
fore they come to a. definite deci-
sion as to which‘frater‘nity they
should pledge. None .of these men
are eligible for initiation until they

_ Sta§’Affalrs Best
When the present economic sit-
uation and the fact that the fra-
ternities cut the number of. rush-
ing events in half is given consid-
eration, the results are felt to be
‘successful. In the opinion of many
fraternity men, luncheons, smokers,
and social affairs when men are
present only are more satisfactory
than dances and other costly social
events. The present ‘season has
been for the most part considered
successful. Fraternities pledged
anywhere from one to sixteen m-en
this year.

The first major dance of th-e sea-
son, the Sophomore“ Hop, will be
held at -the Schenley Hotel, Friday,
December 4. with the lowest as-
sessment charged for any major
dance held during the past few
years. Three dollars is the price
for tickets recently announced by
the committee. The reduction in
price is in keeping wi-th_the trend
toward lower prices of college so-
cial functions. The commitee has
also considered the great number
of campus dances and the economic
situation in deciding on the cut.

In celebration of “Women’s Day”
the Women’s Staff will edit the
December 4th edition of the Week-

ate Editor, Elaine Foraker and We-
men's Editor, Gladys Pyle.

It is an annual custom for the
boys to be liberal and to take a
vacation, leaving the tedious job of
tanning a paper to the girls. They
are dubious and worried over the
outcome, but must concede, under
pressure,‘ that the girls can do
pretty good job. I ‘

ual, all the men's news and even
the sports will be written to such
extent as to rival the best efforts
of Mr Cohen, himself.

The women~ are slightly handi-
capped by the lack of women mem-
bers on the staff. In order to have
the edition written wholly by wo-
men, they are making it a reun-
ion issue. All the campus leaders
who formerly worked as members.
of the staff are being called upon
to write special assignments.

An attempt will be made to imi-
fate the indomitable Sunny's Pitt

end of Freshman Customs enforce-

ment at a. tea yesterday afternoon-

from 3:30 -to 5:00 at Heinz House
given by the Customs Committee.

Dorothy Lewis, Col. ’34, chairman
of customs, said, “There is always
a certain amount of adverse criti-
cism about customs enforcement;
however I think we might s y that
customs have been reason ly suc-
cessful in their purpose which is to
create and promote among Fresh-
man women friendship and Pitt
spirit. _ -

The custom of giving Panthersto
deserving freshmen dates back six
years The Panther of that time
was a blue and gold «felt affair to be
worn on ‘sport sweaters. A few
years later a small silver stick p_in
was «adopted. The present type of
pin was adopted two years ago and
is a brooch pin with the image of

Director Opens Sigma Xi
Lecture Series

 

Dr. Andrey A. Avinoff, director

I of the Carnegie Museum and assist-

ant professor of fine arts in the
University, speaking before an en-
thusiastic audience of nearly 500
persons on the subject, “The Art
of Paleolithic and Neolithic Man,”
last Wednesday evening delivered
the first of a series of lectures
sponsored by the Pitt’chapter of
the Sigma Xi, national honorary
scientific fraternity.

Theilecture was given in the au-
Frick Training
School, and was preceded by a din-
ner for members of the society.

Dr Avinoff traced in chronologi-
cal order the development of pre-
historic art from the earliest work
of Paleolithic man down to the end
of the Neolithic period. Modern
painting, D_r. Avinoﬁf pointed out,
has been erroneously credited with
the discovery of new composition
techniques. Impressionism and fu-
turi-sm, the so-called unusual tech-
niques of the modern school, are
evidenced in the art of prehistoric
man, the speaker disclosed, offer-

 ing illustrations of early wall paint-

ings in support of his ‘statement.
Considerable attention is being
attracted by these Sigma Xillec-
tures, several offers to publish lec-
tures, already having been extend-

A  ed. The complete series of lectures

covering various fields of science,
probably will appear in book form,
it was indicated this week by Dr.
Robert T. Hance, professor and
hoadof‘.-the zoology department and
secretary of the local chapter of

L ' Sigma Xi.

The second! of the series will be
given January 27, with Dr. Mel-
ville J. Herskovits, assistant‘ pro-
fes-sor of anthropology at North-
western University, speaking on
the Speaking
Animal.”

On Europe in Near East

Dr. P. F. Shupp, assistant prorf~es-
sor of history, has just published
his ‘book, ."The European Powers
and the Near Eastern Question
1806-07." It came off the Columbia
University press last week. The

. book is a product of seven years

work and research in London, Par-
is, Vienna, Austria and the United
States.

This work concerns itself with

conditions during the Napoleonic

era. “The balance of power in Eu-
rope became vitally concerned with

' ‘special interests: of great powers

invtfte Near East,” is the text of
the_~book.

Copies of the book have been sent
to the various University libraries

" in the country and to many public
libraries.

Fraternity Leaders ,
On Proposed Rushing Changes

i,

Disagree *

I

Was the reduction of the period
of rushing a success? The presi-
dents of Den fraternities and the
president of Interfraternity Coun-
ci1 were asked this question. Here
are their replies:

Frank A. Goodfellow, president
of lnterfraternity Council:

“I see no reason for having any
rushing events_at all, The real rush-
ing takes place at luncheon and din-

ners, and I see no reason for wasting
money on meaningless expensive
affairs. I am in {favor of abolish-
ing rushing -events altogether."
Lester Eakin, Lambda Chi Alpha:

“I believe, that. since there are
so many fraternities on -the camp-
us, rushing season should be long-
er and there should‘ be more events,
to enable students to get around
more and ‘become better acquaint-
ed.”
Pi Lambda Phi—Ed De Mesquito:

“In my opinion two rushing
events are sufficient. I consider
dances most effective in rushing,
although a well-rounded rushing
program should contain numerous
outside affairs, such as theater
parties and luncheons.”
Phi Kappa—Haro1d Cronin

“I am heartily in favor of two
rushing events. although I am firm-
ly opposed‘ to the elimination of all
rushing affairs. Since the object of
rushing is to acquaint fraternity
men with the rushees, and since a
rushee’s behavior at a. dance or
smoker reveals a side of his char-
acter which would otherwise re-
main hidden, I believe that any
move proposing to abolish. rushing
events would be inadvisable.”
Sigma Chi——George Harrington

“I am quite satisfied with the
effectiveness of two «events. Lunch-
eons are the most important of all
affairs. Special functions are very
unneccessary.” ‘
Sigma Pi-——Edward Hutton

“In face of present conditions I
consider two events enough. These

should be divided between dinners
and dances and may be supplement-
ed by outside theater parties and
the like.”

Delta Sigma Phi—Milton Bradley

“In view of the fact that we have
fewer prospective pledges today. 1
think a reduction in the number
of rushing events is only just to
the fraternity.”

Kappa Sigma——Robert A. Kiser, Jr.

“Kappa Sigma feels that there is
too much glamour to the preten-
tious rushing events in vogue at
Pitt. We believe that the fraterni-
ty organizations on the campus
should agree to limit rushing to
luncheon and dinner engagements.
This would not only relieve the
fraternities of a financial burden
but would give the freshmen a true
impression of the fraternity, its
men, its habits and its ideals.”f
Omega Delta——Paul Best

“I am decidedly in favor of two
events. I find dinners afford pros-
pective pledges a very good chance
to become acquainted with the fra-
ternity men. I consider smokers
next in importance, and dances the
least necessary.”

Theta Chi—-Anderson Ramsey

“I found that two events were
sufficient this year. Smokers and
dinners are much more effective
‘than dances."

Delta Tau Delta—John Stirling

“I consider two events sufficient
for the time allotted for rushing.
The period last year was too long;
five days is plenty. In regard to the
effectiveness of various events, I
cogsider a barbecue which is nei-
th r a, smoker nor a dance, the
most sufficing.”

Sigma Alpha Mu—P. L. Friedman:

“The number of events should
not be limited, for individual rush-s
ing is continuous throughout every
day of the rushing period. More
money is spent on individual rush-
ing each year than on registered
rushing events themselves. Fresh-
men are more impressed by the lat-
ter than 'by the former.”

Bowman delivered the main ad-
dress of the reception, stressing
the importance of cooperative re-
lationship between parents and
the University. Sons and‘ daughters
should be encouraged in theirwork

bouyant frame of mind. They
should be treated not as sons and

. daughters, but as important people.

Dean of Men Robert C. Clothier.
general chairman of the reception
wishes to publicly thank the stud-
ents who acted as aides for the oc-
casion. The success of the evening
was due very largely to their co-
operation and to the splendid way
in which they did their job. ‘

al musical selections, after which
parents were escorted to the ban-

To be Prepared or Not
Is Leading Question
In Weekly Poll

A “Disarmament Poll” will
be run in the Weekly to deter-
mine the concensus of opinion
on the campus concerning this
international question.

The Disarmament Discussion ;
Group of the Y" Clubs has tak-
en as their project the task of
enlightening the students on
the advantages and disadvant-
ages of disarmament. The)’
have succeeded in securing a
number of books dealing with
the subject “pro” and "con"
and have placed them, on re-
serve in the library.

The shelf contains a very
interesting book, “Between
War and Peace,” by Florence
Brewer, Boeckel, educational’
directior of the National Coun-
cil for the Prevention of War.
In her writing, Miss Boeckel
says, “The function of the
peace movement is to build up
a public opinion which will re-
quire governments to ‘concen-
trate their attention upon the
peace problems befdre all oth-
ers.”

Norman Angeli. has written
a study of the relations of mil-
itary power to national advan-
tage, entitled, “The Great Illu-
sion.” He maintains that “Mi1-
itary Power is socially and
economically futile and can
have no relation to the pros-
perity of the people exercis-
ing it.”

The discussion of this topic
has created much interest
among the students and facul-
ty. The committee is not offi-
cially organized but has been
doing excellent work in gath-
ering material on path sides
of the question. Any student
desiring additional books add-
‘ed to the shelf may suggest
them to Dorothy Brindley, Col.
’32, Virginia Craft, Col. '33, or
any member of the committee.

Dr. N. A. N. Cleven in Peru

A comic opera revolution, led by
a half-wit, was the reception given
Dr. and Mrs. N. A. N. Cleven upon
their arrival in Lima, Peru, stated
the history professor in an inter-
view with a Weekly reporter.

On November 24, 1930, the con-
servative forces attempted to over-
throw their president, Sancho Cer-
ro. One of the reasons for the con-
spiracy against Cerro was his so-
called communistic policy; it was
said that -Cerro favored American
exploitation. The revolution was:
staged in the main plaza, S-an Mar-;
tin, beginning at 4 o'clock and last-I
ed for two hours. Dr. and Mrs.
Cleven were guests of the United
States Consul. When the mob and
their halfwit leader espied the
Americans they cursed‘ him, accord-
ing to the professor, "in no uncer-
tain terms.”

Dr. Cleven stated that the revolu-
tion was a failure because they
had no real leader and were unor-
ganized.

Dr -Cleven, an authority and
writer on Hispanic America, acted
as a. Research Associate for Carne-
gie Institute of Washington on this
trip in determining the political or-
ganization of Bolivia.

“The students of the universities
play a vital part in'South American

politics,” stated Dr_ Cleven. “They L -

are extremely excitable and often
sing national songs during revolu-
tions and work themselves up into
quite a fervor. I like to tease If}?
students by telling them how. tame
they are. Out of eleven 1ln1Vel'Sl1
ties that I wished to visit, ten were
closed because of some uprising 01'

other disturbance among the stu-

dents.”

“Buenos Aires, capital of Argen-
tina, is one of the most beautiful
cities in the world. In fact.” said
Dr. Cleven. “none of the cities in
the United «States are as beautiful
as several of the ones that I visited.
The foliage, natural scenic beauty.
and climate all combine to make
Latin America countries most pic-
turesque and beautiful.”

In conclusion, Dr. Cleven stated,

“The future of Hispanic America ’

is very bright because of‘the tre-
mendous potentialities, human and
physical, of these countries. His»
panic America wants United -States’
capital but they want humane cap-
ital. Progress in democracy is be-
ing gradually and effectively made.
Resources are inexhaustible.”

Censorship
Disapproved

Faculty Interference

Adoption of a. resolution express-
ing unanimous opposition to cen-
sorship of college papers bl’ faC1l1~
ty members was the chief action
taken by representatives to the an-
nual convention of the National
College Press Association, which.
met at 'Le.x.ington, Kentucky, Friday |
and Saturday.

Other important features of the
sessions included reelection of Pro-
fessor William S. Maulsby, head of
the Pitt department of journalism,
as" executive secretary of the organ-
ization, and selection of Tulane
University, New Orleans, as the
convention sch-ool for next year.

Action of the school journalists
in expressing op-position to faculty
censorship followed a similar reso-
lution which was passed last week
by Sigma Delta. Chi, national pro-
fessional journalistic fraternity, in
its annual convention at Minneapo-
lis,

At the Kentucky convention, a
plar. was also worked‘ out whereby
school papers will attempt to obtain
better relationships with publish-
ers representatives in the securing
of national advertising._

Pitt had the largest delegation
at the c-onvention with Professor
Maulsby, Robert Machesney,’ editor,
Franklin Kallfelz, business mana-
gler, and Fred Beiter, circulation
manager, in attendance. More than
40 delegates representing approxi-

mately 25 student papers attended
the conference.

Frosh Customs for This

The sophomores

without trimmings” to the
{freshmen with the announce-
ment that customs pass into
oblivion as far as the class of
'35 is concerned at four o'clock
today. ‘

This announcement comes as
a climax to a rather colorful
regulations season. The enforce-
ment of customs this year was
slow in starting but finally the
sophomores and Druids made a.
concerted effort to make the
freshmen toe the mark. This
resulted in an outburst which
nearly assumed the propor-
tions of a riot, on Friday, Oc-
eober 23. A number of fresh-
men were rounded up at this
time I-and made to assume the
“royal angle.”

This meeting was disturbed
by the advent of a. solitary po-
lice-man. who was attracted to
the scene. The assembly imme-
diately scattered, and, as to
customs, after a few brief days
of observance, the freshmen
again lapsed into forgetfulness
and remained so until the pres-

Four Men Forced To Drop
Excess Activities

 

 

Five senior men were called be-
fore the Point Scale Committee of
the otlice of the dean of men dur-
ing the past weeks. because they
carried more than the maximum

10 points allowed by the commit-
tee.

Paul Best, Bus. Ad.; Daniel But-
ler, Bus. Ad., and James McAfee,.
Mines, were all compelled to re-
linquish activities in order to .con-
form more rigidly with the pro-
vision of the committee. Frank
Goodfellow, Bus. Ad., was permit-
ted to carry one excess point, with-
out dropping any position.

Best resigned as president of the
Inquiry Club of the Y. M. C. A., a
position that carried one point. He
was permitted to retain his other
positions and to carry one excess
point. Best is president of Omega
Delta, social fraternity, a member
of Interfraternity Council, member
of Student Council, and a member
of the band.

Butler Drops Six

Daniel Butler, who was carry-
ing 18 points, eight in excess,
dropped his interest in debating,
and the presidency of the John
Marshall Club. These two posi-
tions netted six points. He was
permitted to retain his position as
President of Sigma Alpha,Epsil0n.
social fraternity, chairmanship of
Interfraternity Ball, and manager-
ship of the cross country team,
for a total of 12 activity points.
The committee granted him two
extra points on the ground that
the positions of cross country man-
ager and Interfraternity Ball
chairman did not conﬂict.

Machesney, who had 15 points,
gave up the presidency of the Col-
lege Association, a position that
carried 4 credits. He is also editor
of the Pitt Weekly, president of
Omicron Delta Kappa, national
honorary fraternity, and president
of Sigma Delta Chi, national pro-
fessional Journalistic fraternity.

James McAfee, was permitted to
carry 13 points, after he had re-
duced his total from 17 by resign-
ing as a member of the executive
committee of the Y. M. C. A., Mc-
Afee’s activities include the presi-
dency of Pitkin Club, treasurer of
Student Council, president of Cap
and Gown Club, treasurer of Sig-
ma 'l‘au, honorary engineering fra-
ternity, vice-president of Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon, and vice-president of
the Mines Association.

Goofellow Retains 11.

Goodfellow has 11 activities
points as comptroller of the Pitt
Weekly and president of Interfra-
ternity Council.

In announcing the action of the
committee, Robert C. Clothier,
dean of men, stressed the fact that
the men affected were not asked
to resign activities because of
their scholarship standing, but be-
cause it is the purpose of the com-
mitte to seek a more equitable
distribution of activity positions
among members of the student
body. - _,

The Pitt boxers were well re-
.'ceived by an enthusiastic gather-
ing at the smoker given by the
‘School of Mines in the Activities
iBuilding last Friday night. The
boxers demonstrated the different
amethods employed by the various
-. classes of boxers, with the 115.
'_"125 and the heavyweight class be-

-‘ ling’ represented.

Patterson and Carmela opened
up the festivities in a fast three
found demonstration. Both boys
‘weighed in at 115 pounds. In the
125. pound class, Speigal and Zei-
-den put on a real crowd-pleaser.

heavyweight demonstration. to.

’Telegraphic Matches
Open Riflers’ Season

Headed by Captain Harold Back-
‘en, the varsity rifle team lifted the
.lid from its official season this
‘week, meeting in telegraphic match-

es Form College, Cooper Union, and
the University of Pennsylvania.
Ten members of the squad took
part in the contest, but only the
five highest scores were counted.

The candidates for the R. O. T.

C., rifle team are to report for the
squad at the Stadium rifle range on
Monday afternoon, November 30.
,-Any member of the R. O. T, C.. re-
gardless of classification is eligible
- for this team. Several of those who
~-tried out for the varsity but failed

held the upper hand during the re-
mainder of the struggle, North-
western’s early lead proved suffi-
cient in the final result.

Huskers Win Seven

Since that game Nebraska has
come through with a perfect slate.
Oklahoma fell, 13-0. Kansas was
subdued, 6-0. Missouri was con-
quered, 10-7. Iowa lost, 7-0. Kansas
State was vanquished‘, 6-3. And lo-
wa State the last stone in the path
of the Cornhuskers to the “Big
Six” championship. was trounced,
23-0. In addition the Nebraskans
hold an early season victory over
South Dakota, 44-6.

The visitors will enter the game
with seven men who were in the
opening lineup when they played a
scoreless tie with the Panthers at
Lincoln last year. Hugh Rh-ea, an
all-American tackle last year and a
strong candidate for the same
berth this year, will play on the
left side of the line.

Koster and Justice will be at the
guards and Ely will -occupy the piv-
-ot berth. Kreizinger and Paul are
veteran half-backs, and Brown is
an experienced quarterback. New-
comers in the lineup are Joy and
Durhee, ends; O-‘Brien, a tackle,
and Sauer, sophomore fullback who
in his first year of varsity competi-
tion, has stamped himself as the

outstanding line plunger in the
Missouri Valley.

An interesting feature lot the
game will be the duel between

Rlrea and Jim MacMurdo, the Pan-
ther’s chief bid for all-American

recognition These men have metr-

twice before. once in 1929 when
last year when Big Jim was an
end. Tomorow both will meet for
the last" time on collegiate grid-
irons and this year’s all-American
rating may rest upon the showing
each makes in the game.

P‘itt Loses Stars

In aitlditlon to MacMurdo, ten oth-
er Pitt players will be playing the
final game of their career for the
Panthers, unless Pitt schedules a
post-season tilt. The entire first
team line will graduate. These men
include Captain Eddie Hirshberg,
Jess Quatse, Rip Collins, Hart
Morris. Mike Milligan, Ralph Daugh-
erty, Bob Morris, Herman Yentch,
Ray Anderson, Joe Tommins. Jim-
my Clark is- the lone backfield man
to graduate.

‘There is not much upon which to
basic predictions for this game.
B-oth t.eams played Iowa and Pitt’s
margin of superiority over the
Hawkeyes was 13 points more than
that of N ebraska, but ‘Harvard beat
two teams which held Yale to tie
scores. *

On the defense, Niebraska has
had‘ 35 points scored against it this
year, while Pitt’s opponents have
registered 37 points against it. The
difference is practically negligible,
although the Nebraska opponents
have been teams which have de-
pended mainly upon line plays for
their l-ongest gains, while the Pan-
thers have been forced to comba.t
teams which have dependedupon
aerial attacks for their best ground
gainers.

It is on the offense that Pitt’s
real power will come to light. The
Panthers have scored 240 this year
for an average of 30 per contest.
Nebraska has marked up 116 points
in eight games, an average of 14 1-2
per game. .

Both teams have powerful lines,
and this should help keep the score
down "if both teams stick to the
ground. But Pitt won't unless Ne-
braska wierakens its line in order to
strengthen‘ its defense against the
famed Pitt aerial attack. Whatever
haDpens——Well, you can see for
Yourself tomorow. And here it is,
the la.st prediction to be made by
me as the Campus Scout——Pitt 21,

tation and incidentally, my pocket-
book, I hope I hit it right on the

Freshman Cage Squad

Practices for Opener

 

Coach Paul Zehfuss is keeping
his freshman basketballsquad hard
at work in preparation for the ini-
tial basketball game of the season,
December 12. The team will meet
Taylor Alldendice High School and
is spending late hours in the gym
in preparation for the expected
hard tussle.

The yearlings, in their workouts
last week with the varsity, showed
promise of developing into a
smooth and powerful combination
but much of the “Carlson system”
has yet to be learned, and lon-g
hours are being spent in the stadi-
um.

‘Many of the boys on this year's
team are former W. P. I. A. L. se-
lections, and these. together with
other high school stars, will n'o
doubt give Dr. Carlson a nucleusfor
future “Win-em-all” teams, but
this year they are going to concen-
trate on the job of giving Coach
Zehfuss the traditional undefeated
team in his first year as tutor.

For Temple Lid-Lifter

With the opening of the season

IIGSB than three weeks away, Pitt’s
golden-clad basket.eers are ap-
proaching their normal stride.
Practice games with the leading in-
dependent teams of the district,
and extensive sessions with the
freshmen have aided’ the golden
Panthers to polish off the rough
spots in their complicated offensive

peak required for the lid-lifter

ion, December 12 '

Two years ago, the Pitt lads
gave Temple's «floormen a lacing on
their own floor at a time when
Temple was being rated as one of
the leading quints in the East, and
it is certain that the Panthers will
stack up against a foe eager to
avenge that defeat.

Sophomores continue to hold the
center of interest at the practice
sesions and it seems from all indi-
cations that “Dutch” Ochsenhirt and
“Don” McCama.nt will be seen fre-
quently in the starting lineup when

Set Date for Opening
Of Basketball League

The Men's Independent Basket-
ball league will begin on Tuesday,
December 15. This year, any regis-
tered student of the University, ex-
cept a fraternity member is urged
to join an independent team and -to
compete in the newly organized
league. There will be eight men to
a. team. Assistant Professor J. A.
Potts of the Physical Education de-
partmept is in charge of the
league.

“In former years. the Independent
League has been a ‘flop,’ because
not many students took interest,”
Potts said. “If all the different
schools and organizations would
get up a team or teams, rivalry
would be keen and we would have
a good league.’

Potts feels that there are enough
good players to make things real
interesting. The engineers ought to
be able to scrape up a couple of
cracker-jack teams; as should the
dents the med. students and the biz-
ads.

Practices will start Tuesday, De-

made with Mr. Potts at the Phys.-

encountered} unexpected opposition
and lost by a score of 20-35.

The frosh also -ended their sea-
son on Friday afternoon, defeating
the Tech frosh by the same score
as the Tech varsity defeated the Pitt
varsity. The fro-sh gained their vic-

The varsity record includes vic-

the A. A. A. U. meet while losing
to Syracuse, West Virginia, Penn

Penn State and Carnegie Tech, but
lost to -Syracuse in an early sea-
son upset.

Coach Shea is looking «forward to
a more successful season next year.
With only three of this year’s team
graduating, the prospects are in-

ans of this year’s team X

Strong Nebraska Line

With the elimination of Harvard
fromfthe ranks of the undefeated,
Pitt§'has. in the eyes of many, the
leading team in the East. There is
only" one undefeated team in the
East -at the present time, Bucknell,
but it has played three ties, and
has not played the class of teams
that the other schools have.

=.In an interview with Coach Suth-
erland, the coach stated that after
the completion of the Thanksgiv-

ing Day game, he might feel safe

in saying that Pitt’s team was sec-
ond to none. He made mention of
the fact that Nebraska has one of
its usual super-powerful ‘lines and
fast-working backfields. Nebraska
played Northwestern and was de-
rfeated by virtue of Northwestern’s
interception of two forward passes
which ultimately led to touchdowns
The Cornhuskers are noted for
their strong‘ teams and will come
to Pittsburgh prepared to “do or
die for old Nebraska.”

The coach stated that it is not
very easy to contrast one year’s
team with another on account of
the variance in their schedules, and
the differences in the teams play-
ed. However, it would not be wrong
to say that a team which can beat
an Army combine 26-0 the largest
score by which it has been beaten
in three years, can be compared
very favorably to any Pitt team
from any time.

pends, to a great extent, upon

During the pledge period.

A second conditioning factor
which determines Whether 01‘

Finally, and most important
in our opinion, the brothers

Lower Fees’

VIRST EVIDENCE of a gen-
eral decrease in the assess-
ments for Pitt social affairs
was obtained this week when
the committee in charge of the
Soph Hop announced that the
fee for that event would be
three dollars. This is the low-
est admission set for the Soph
dance during a period of more
than eight years.

The action of the committee
in reducing the assessment
charge is a result of the econ-
omic status in which most stu-
dents find themselves this
Fall. It also follows the pro-
cedure advocated by students
in the social survey which was
conducted on the campus last
Spring and gives hope that
that investigation was not so
futile as was first suspected. -

The Soph Hop committee is
to be congratulated and it is
hoped that other dance chair-
men will follow the example it
has set.

 

Looking over the lists of the
mlodemgreat in the world of play-
wrights, we are inclined--perhaps

ieven forced-—- to believe that only

the weak and the violent are writ-
ing dramas in these bleak days,
that the vigorous and the reason-

able have gone to other fields.

that there are only tWo types of
plays on the boards at Dresellt
the distorted and the fragile sorts.

. Perhaps the week has been a bad

one; perhaps a combination of Pro-

— cessional, Tomorrow and Tomor-

row, and an anticipated Morning

 Becomes Electra is not conducive

to an optimistic outlook. But "the
modern drama is a sorry enough
landscape-—at least so far as we
can see.

bigness. But there must be

glorious bone and muscle to

If there is no pattern, if there

is no basis, no thesis worth

ephantitus of the dramatic
sense.

But if we reject Eugene O’Neill
and his companions in violence,
what shall we have left? A gra-
cious fantasy or two, some plays
about players, some Cinderella im-
possibilities, some cross sections
of sophisticated European life,
some political realisms, and some
wistful things about people who
didn’t do the things that they do-
cided to do, who managed, never-

all right, we are getting along very

there is violence that verges
on hysteria and gets lost in
strange and unimportant lands.

Where there is a combination

of taste and actual virility,

both are so fragile that the re-
sultant play is a nonentity.

Will we ever have a new dram-

atist? And, should he come,

will he bring with him those
two lost mainstays of the an-
cient great—-reason and virili-

CREAM
OF T HE
COLLEGES

Duke University-——Two psychol-
ogy students experimented to ﬁnd
out how long it took the normal
bull session to turn to subjects con-
cerning women. The average time
was six minutes. Their method
was to go to a room and start a
conversation about anything but
women,.

Washington and Lee—Fox-hunt-
ing has assumed a place in the
major sport list. Now isn't that
winning an athletic letter in a
pleasurable manner.

 

North Carolina University——The
Daily Tar Heel, the official mouth-
organ of the University of North
Carolina: has elected “Alfalfa” Bill
,Murray, Governor of Oaklahoma,
to their Hall of Fame because he
recently blared forth “Who gets
any good from changing text books
except the publishing houses?"

 

Oregon UniversIty——Two-thirds of
a group of teachers at Oregon could
not answer this one. If 36 men in
28 days of 8 hours each can buil_d
a wall 680 feet long, 12 feet high
and 3.5 inches thick, how long will
be a wall that is 2.5 feet thick, 10
feet high, that 24 men can build In
15 days of 10 hours each?

 

Penn State—-The ego of the men
on the campus has been broken
down somewhat by the coeds, ac-
cording to a recent survey of coed
opinion. The girls state that the
Penn State man is bothered with
a “superiority complex camouﬂag-
ing a lack of self-assurance.”

 

South Carolina, UniVersity——A
columnist picked out eleven names
of football players over the coun-
try and grouped them in one fan-
tastic team. We wonder how
“Jock” would like to have a squad
like this?--Savage, Thrasher, Leer,
Hammer, Knuckles, Slay, Stab,
Mock, Anger and Bledsoe.
it would be psychologically de-
pressing for our opponents.

 

to a questionnaire, ninety per cent
of the students expressed belief in
a God.

 

University of Missouri-‘-The an-
cient but ever hilarious quip about
the absent-minded professor be-
came a reality recently.. George
R. Edwards, professor in the class
in football coaching, blithely en.
tered his classroom one day,
pranced to the hat-rack, plabed his
cigarette nonchalantly upon it,
then opened the window and tossed
out his hat. (We'll bet the class
didn't convene until the professor
has retreived his fedora).

 

Yale University-——It has been dis-
covered that back in 1884 the foot-
ball season netted the school $3,500,
$25.00 of which was used for train-
ing expenses. ~

 

Temple University--Little. Jack
Little, famous crooner of the ether,
stated in an interview with a mem-
ber of the Temple University News
staff that college education Is valu-
able because, “a college man, If he

years, gets poise, and let me tell
you, that poise is worth money.”

In

University of Minnesota—7“Betty
the Bootblack” might be a more
appropriate title than “Betty Co-ed"
in this instance. Women at the
University of Minnesota actually
are getting their dainty little ﬁn-
gers dirty by means of honest toil.
They're shining shoes! In an ef-
fort to raise funds to refurnish
their oﬂice, the Y. W. C. A. mem-
bers are polishing shoes, manicur-

standard shine price has been set
at 10 cents. '

 

Syracuse University-—The old
intelligence tests the men took in
the army duiring. the World War
were dreams ‘compared with that
devised by Professor Robert Paris
Carroll. Here's one of the ques-
tions that nobody has answered
yet: "To the product of -’/3 of 64
and the quotient obtained by ‘di-
viding %, of the difference between
5/16 of 96 and ‘%- of 8 by 1/7 of
% of the sum of % of 56 and 1/16
of 112-add 9/10 of V2 of the product
of 42 and %- of the difference be-
tween 6/7 and 7/10 of 4-0."
computation is to be done on paper.

 

Stanford University-—-The admin-
istration at Stanford has turned
against the good clean fun which
annually results from the Frosh-
Sophomore feud because, several
campus buildings were decorated

. with the legend, “To . . . . . .. with

1934.”

 

Harvard University-—Some of the
rules for Freshmen of Harvard
University in 1734 were:

“No freshman shall wear his hat
in the college yard except when it
rains or snows, or be on horseback,
or hath both hands full.'’

“No freshman shall use lying or
equivocation to escape going on an
errand.”

“F-'_reshmen may wear their hats
at dinner and supper except when
they go to receive their Commons
of bread and beer.” »

Thaw Hall Luncli Stand
Opened by Student Loan

 

Student Loan, one of the com-
mittees included in W. S. G. A.,
has opened a. sandwich and milk
stand on the first ﬂoor of Thaw
Hall.

Anne Kuhar, Bus. Ad. ’32, chair-
man of Student Loan, in comment-
ing on the project, says: “For
some time, there has been a de-
mand for a refreshment stand at
Thaw Hall, especially for the bene-
ﬁt of students during long labora-
tory periods, and in opening our
stand, we feel that besides helping
ourselves ﬁnancially, we, are _ 
accommodating thdse students.” '

they (the uniforms, you dope!) are oh-so-tight
that the “key-dets” can't take a deep, deep
breath without loosening a few buttons . . .
Paul (“out-of-bounds”) Reider dutifully opens
his notebook and gets out his pen in lecture
classes . . . T'other day I peeked into his note-
book . . on the first page is his name . . .

Editor, The Pitt Weekly,

I was indeed saddened by re-
ports in the newspapers that
thousands of Pitt students at-
tended a commissioning cere-
mony for honorary girl officers
of the Pitt ROTC, while less
than a hundred attended a
meeting on the campus at the
same hour where opportunity
was given for discussion with
the author, lecturer and auth-
ority on world peace——-Kirby
Page.

, May I ask, as a bewildered
alumnus, why this unusual dis-
play of enthusiasm on the
part of the Pitt student body?
Was it a resurgence of the
“old school spirit,” whose de-
cline in recent years has been
bemoaned by the old-timers?
‘Certainly, school spirit is mis-
directed when it leads to act-
tivity which injures the school
in the eyes of the world. Ab- .
stractly, what would WE think
of a school with such preva-
lent mindsets that the stud-
ents pass up an international-
ly eminent figure like Kirby
Page to watch a tribe of high-
ly decorated quasi-morons par-
ticipate in some‘ sort of a
“May Queen’-’ ceremony?

I have purposely avoided
the whole issue of militarism
and pacifism, as I have at-
tempted to interpret, perhaps
faultily, the attitude behind
the above mentioned student
action. Don’t you think Pitt
students should use their
heads at least enough to avoid
making Pitt a laughing stock?
(Nor has the student genera-
tion before you been blame-
less.)
