Belly Enters Independent Presidency Bid

Student Radio Panel

Of Black Power Drive

The term Black Power re-
fers to the “assertion of the
dignity of the Negro,” stat-
ed Ken Mitchell, junior
major in political science,
during “College Forum”
Sunday night.

Mitchell beli-eved that the anti-
white feeling arose as a result
of centuries of frustration of
the Negro. Now, he stated, “The
pace of the white libera-ls is not
the pace the Negroes feel they
need.” He added, however, that

-Black Power is not anti-white

by deﬁnition, but by action. The
tsernantic aspect of the term gen-
erates an-ti-white feeling, accord-
ing to Mitchell.

Ken Frederick, president of
Student Government, added that
Black Power may be more _a
pro-black sentiment than an an-
ti-white one, such as that gen-
erated by H. Rap Brown and
Stokely Carmichael.

Mitchell commented that the
roles. of Brown and Carmichael
are sometimes exaggerated by
“journalistic sensat i o n al i s m . ’ ’
But in another sense, he stated,

they are underated, for they

represent the lack of communi-
cation between whites and Ne-

groes. “Black America is unhap-

py with white America,” affirm-
ed Mitchell.

. As a justiﬁcatinon of the Black
Power movement, Linda Gold-
stein, editor of The Pitt News,
read a report issued by the US
Oivil Rights Committee last
month. The report stated that
the Negroes are “disenchanted
with the like-lihood of progress.”

,Center Offers
Free Vocational
Aptitude Tests

The University Counseling
Center will offer in February
free occupational interests tests.
The tests, to be given in groups,
are designed as objective aid-s
for those concerned in knowing
more about their vocational in-
terests.

After the tests, the students
will be given the free option of
discussing the results with a
member -of the Center.

Anyone is eligible for the
tests. They will be given at the
office of the Center under b-oth
day and evening administration.
Interested person-s may contact
the Center, 205 SU, at ext. 7265
to request which time they pre-
fer. Exact dates of the tests will
be announced early in February-

BOOK EXCHANGE
All students who submitted
books to the SG Book Ex-
change may collect their mon-
ey and/or books Tuesday and

Wednesday of next week in i

They feel the “programs have
failed to grapple with conditions
plaguing the Negroes’ existence.”

Miss Goldstein said that the
report reiterated -some truths
about black America. “What’s
not visible to the eye,” says the
report, “and What is apparent-
ly not generally understood, is
the feeling of many Northern
ghetto residents that they live
in a ‘trap’ from which they can-
not escape.”

When questioned cm the sub-
ject of ghetto riots, Frederick
observed that there is no longer
a question of there being riots,
but of the frequency and loca-
tion. Mitchell theorized that the
major cities could look forward
to more “rootin’, tootlln’, shoot-
in’, and lootin’. The Negro is
more militant now because of
the urgency of his situation,”
said Mitchell.

The situation is improved lit-
tle by his use of voting power.
Said Miss G-oldstein, “The Ne-
gro is used _to balance the tick-
et. The three levels o-f local,
state, and national politics are
not a way a Negro can express
his feelings.”

Mitchell did n-ot believe that
there is one person who can
help the Negro communicate his
feelings. “King is losing o-ut . . .
his efforts are not what Negroes
-need at present. . Stokely
Carmichael has a larger, or
more active, following than
King.”

“The American Negro and
Social Change” is the topic
of an informal course to be
offered by the University
this winter. The course is
part of the Community Ser-
iesi being sponsored by the

The course, focusing on the
American Negro, will explore
the social changes which Amer-
ica's Negro population has un-
dergone in the last 250 years,
the relation of the Negro popu-
laitt-ion to American society, and
the structure a.nd aims o-f the
current s-ociall movement. Dr.

' Arthur Tuden, associate profes-

sor of anthropology at the Uni-
versity, will teach the course.

Like the course on the Amer-
ican Negro, many of the offer-
ings this winter will highlight
the contemporary American
scene. The listing includes cours-
es in politics, economics, drama,
and painting.

There will also be offerings in
speed reading, inveisit;ment.s, trav-

‘ el, social psychology, public re-

«liatiions, creative writing, East

Greece, and a three-week trip
to Portugal, Spain, Switzerland,
Austria, and Berlin.

Although several of the cours-
es have already started, most

New Director of Planning Arrives

 

Economist ]oins ' University

Professor States Purpose
Of a Measurement System

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

Professor R. Duncan Luce, professor of -math psy-
chology at the University of Pennsylvania, stated as the
purpose of numbers “the representation of information
from observation” at the Philosophy of Science lecture
Monday. He also said that any measurement has to do
with the circumstances under which to represent a vari-

able.

Using the classical example of measurement, the
physical entities of length and mass, Luce stated as the
purpose of a measurement system the ordering of rela-
tionships through systematic procedures. He said that any
measurement theory would be concerned with describing

properties wh.ich would be for-
mulated as a series of axioms
ﬂailing into three categories:
Transitive, Archimedian, and
Structural.

According to Luce, all theories
are concerned with both the
preservation of order, a basic
requirement for measurement,
and additivity. H-e said that if
the right axiom systems are
used, all systems can be traced
back to Ho1der’s Theorum.

Luce hopes that the research
being done in measurement will
lead to facilitation of the use of
qualitative order in ﬁelds, such
as the Behavioral Sciences,
‘where the present trend is to-
ward failure to accurately re-p-
resent qualitatively what is ac-
itually being measured.

Campaign Commentary

Editorial: A

  New Turn

In the course of one day, the Student Government
(SG) election- campaign has radically altered its course. A
new presidential candidate, Armand Belly, has thrown his
hat into the ring. Running with his fellow debator, Ken
Holecko, as his vice-presidential candidate, Belly is not af-
filiated with any party.

Belly’s credentials are impressive: he is currently
president of the William Pitt Debate Union (WPDU) and
last year served as president of the University chapter of
the NAACP. A William Pitt Scholar and a Junior Worthy,
he was vice-president of the Liberal Union and president of
Tau Kappa Alpha, forensic honorary.

Holecko, too, has participated in several activities. A
-William Pitt Scholar and secretary of WPDU, Holecko IS
a member of the SG Liberal Arts Cabinet, the Student

- Union Board Public Affairs Committee, the Pitt Pre-Law

Society, and the Young Democrats.

More important than Belly’s qualifications is his rea-
son for running———“to provide an alternative to University

, students, an alternative to the mediocrity of our opponents.”

Belly feels that.“Student Government has been a farce. 113
has been a waste of time, energy, and money. It serves no
conceivable function on the University of Pittsburgh cam-
pus, and, in fact, tends to divert student attention from the
real problems facing them.”

We commend Belly’s entry into the race, for whether
étﬂb lntlsnggkree or wdgsagree with him, what he hasto say
concerning S 5% woithy ‘6‘f ‘t‘h'é’i'r attention-. Belly is c"ual=
lenging SG as it currently exists on our campus, whereas
the other candidates in their statements thus far accept the
system but propose improvements.

A question that immediately comes to mind upon hear-
ing Belly’s statement that SG is a farce is “what alterna-
tives does he propose to it?” There is an undeniable need for
an organization to represent our student body and to ac-
tively seek to remedy the inequities that exist in key areas
that concern students. If, as Belly states SG is not meeting
-this need, what type of organization can fill this void? If
SG should be restructed, how can this be achieved?

We can only hope that Belly’s philosophy concerning
SG serves as an incentive to make all three candidates
question the existence of SG as it currently operates. A

 debate on the structure of this organization is sorely need-

ed, and hopefully Belly’s statement will serve as an im-

 petus.

Too many students tend to View the 'SG presidential

- election merely as a popularity contest, and we cannot al-

ter the obvious fact that the person with the majority of
votes wins. We do, hope, however, that this new challenge
forces all candidates to do the soul searching they must do
to effectively tackle the subject of SG.

The War at Home

Paradoxical Patriotism

by Dan Lichtenstein

SUPPORT AND non-support for the
Vietnam war are almost as confusing as the
war itself. Demonstrations, marches and
picket lines, all for or against the conﬂict
are obvious exhibitions of the cold division
in this country which is almost as sharp as
the hot one in Southeast Asia.

Questions arise concerning the patriot-
ism of the anti-war protestors. Patriotism
and support for soldiers are certainly ﬁne
moral qualities; but they should arise nat-
urally from an individual. Judging from,
the countless demonstrations against the
administration and its war, hundreds of
thousands ofpeople do not choose to ex-
hibit these particular brands of patriotism.
Such is their right . . . obviously.

But those ﬂag-waving, “Support Our
Boys” patriotic types of the opposite camp
at times seem to be a bit confused in their
counter demonstrations. Their rights are
equally as obvious as the anti-Viet war
demonstrators, and their patriotism is laud-
able. But they tend to go overboardand to
contradict themselves.

ONE EXAMPLE of the pro-war group's
over-zealousness occured at the Liberty
Bowl game several weeks ago. American
flags were handed out to all the spectators
at the game as war heroes of Vietnam were
introducedaon the ﬁeld in a pre-game cere-
mony. The ﬂags were probably, meant to
generate spirit just as our own blue and
gold shakers were at Panther. games this
fall. But the innocently intended sight of
thousands of ﬂags waving for Vietnam sol-
diers was as heinous to the anti-war fac-
tion as the waving of Confederate ﬂags at
Southern games is to Northern liberals.

Whatever any individual’s personal feel-
ings concerning the Vietnam war are, it is
a shame that the sight of thousands of
American ﬂags‘ should be painful to any
American, under any circumstances. No
sentiments of this sort would have arisen
during any of the other wars this country

doxical ﬂag-waving occurred at the Super

Bowl in Miami last Sunday. This instance
of well—intentioned patriotism gone wrong
is almost laughable.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON reportedly said
in the height of the football season that he
does not think the spectacle of hundreds
of America’s best educated young men
knocking each other on the ground on week-
end afternoons, while thousands cheer them
on, is indicative of a peace-loving nation.

Yet in the Super »Bowl’s pre-game cere-
monies, a so-called “All-American” team of
airmen who collectively had ﬂown some 2,-
000 missions over Vietnam was introduced
while three ﬁghter jets roared over the sta-
dium. This demonstration was less violent,
but also less basically peaceful than Green
Bay Packer linebackers chasing opposin
quarterbacks. »

The salute for the veteran ﬂyers would
have been perfectly acceptable at an armed
forces rally. It would have gtznerated great
spirit and patriotism during World War II.
But on Sunday, it was just another remind-
er of the administration’s unpopular war.
And its occurance at the Super Bowl places
it in a curious juxtaposition with the most

publicized game of a sport which President
Johnson considers unpeaceful.

WHATEVER AN individual feels about
the war in Vietnam, it is a horrible shame
that a salute to soldiers or any show of
patriotism. should be questionable in any
way. But anti-Viet groups will ﬁnd fault
with any current exhibition of ﬂag Wav-
ing. And their patriotism will in turn be
doubted and criticized. But are they the
more truly patriotic group by virtue of their
pure peace-loving qualities: the qualities
that have been stressed so often in this

a country’s history?

Such confusion and doubt over such a
basic element as patriotism are perhaps,
inevitable consequences ,of the most con- -

 News

 
 

has fought.

An example of a contradictory or para-

troversial and the most unpopular'war in

this country’s history.

Letters to the Editor

Soph Looks at
Pitt Apathy

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am presently a sophomore
in the college and would like to
express my opinions about uni-
versities, Pitt in particular.

After h-igh -school, I did a
four-year hitch in the Air Force.
While stationed in Europe, I at-
tended the University of Mary-
land’s European Division, and,
during my studies, I encounter-
ed other enlis-ted men who had
attended college before enlist-
ing. Since I had never attended
college, I questioned them ex-
tensively about the academic, so-
cial, and athletic atmosphere of
their schools.

The consensus of opinion was
much the same as that of my
former high school classmates
when I questioned them upon
my return to the States this
summer. No less than 20 mem-
bers of my high school class had
graduated from college this sum-
mer, and the opinions of college
life of these graduates were
much the same as those of my
friends in the service.

The vast majority of those
that I talked to seemed to agree
that it was not where one went
to school, but how much time
and effort the individual put
into his school; not only in the
academic field, but in the social
and athletic functions too.

All this brings me to the mai-n
point: the majority of the stu-

  

dents that I have met at Pitt
since September fail to realize
that they must contribute to the
overall efforts of the campus to
make it the best. Not only the
best in some Gallop Poll, but
the best for them.

Constant critici.sm of the fac-
ulty, athletics, newspaper, etc.
can be heard in any corner of
the campus. But these critics
fai1——1iteral1y fail——to see that
complaints don't bring be-tter
grades, better football teams,
better news coverage.

The sooner these students stop
complaining and begin to con-
tributing to “their” school, the
sooner “their” school will be a
better school for them. Until
that, time, I would like to add
my praise to that of a few stu-
dents who do realize that there
are some people who are con-
tributing something to “their”
school, making “my” school a
better college for me.

Students Clear

Draft Confusion
Editor, The Pitt News:

It has come to our attention
that there has been some con-
fusion about the status of the
Draft Counseling of the West-
ern Pennsylvania Academic
Council (WPAC) as a result of
the literature distributed by the
Resistence and the Students for

Peace Newsletter of Jan. 16,

To clear up this confusion, let
us state that the Draft Coun-
seling Center of the WPAC is
an independent organization of
18 ﬁaculty members wh-o have
made themselves available for
interviews with students wish-

ing to know more about the
draft. They are equipped to an-

swer questions objectively con-
cerning the individual’s rights

and obligations under the Mili-

-‘nary Selective Service Act of
1967.

Also the editorial in the News-
letter of Jan. 16 was not signed
by the Draft Counselors as
might have been construed from
the layout. The names of the
counselors were listed merely to
publicize their service.

We ho-pe this resolves the con-

"fusion.

Study Survey’s Freshmen
Opinions,Attitudes,Behavior

WASHINGTON (CPS)——
An overwhelming majority
of entering college fresh-
men believe faculty mem-

A bers are more competent to

set the curricula but a
large group also believe fac-
ulty pay should be based on
student evaluations of their
performances.

A study of 185,848 freshmen
who entered 252 co-lleges and
universities this fall shows that
85.3 per cent believe faculty
members should determine the
-curricula, while 62.2 per cent
lbelieve faculty salaries should
be based on student evaluations.

The study, conducted by the
American Council on Education
(ACE), also shows '-that 52.2 per
cent believe colleges are -not too

‘ liax in dealing with student dem-

onstrators and that college ad-
ministratorns should be allowed
to censor student publications.

Other results showed that 64.9
per cent want the voting age
lowered to 18, some 56.7 per

cent don't want colleges to give

preferential admissions treat-
ment to the disadvantaged, only
39.5 per cent believe the college
has the right to ban extremist
speakers, and only 20.8 per cent
favor do-emphasizing college
sports.

Other results of the question ,

naire are:

DAlthough 56 per cent said
the main beneﬁt of a college ed-
ucation is increased earning pow-
er, 82.9 per cent rated “develop-
ring a meaningful philosophy of
Elite” as an important objective,
67.8 per cent “becoming an au-
rlihority on a special subject in
my special ﬁeld,” 61.8 per cent

“helping others who are in diffi-
culty,” and 50.6 pr cent “keep-
ing up to date with political af-
fairs.” Less than a majority,
46.4 per cent, said “being suc-
cessful in a business of my
own” is essential or very 
portant.

> Most of the freshmen were
concerned about ﬁnancing their
education, with 57 per cent ex-
pressing some concern, 8.6 per
cent major concern, and 34.4 per
cent no concern. Parental and
family funds were the source
of money for 54.8 per cent, per-

“ sonal savings and earnings for

27.3, scholarships and grants for
17.5 and loans for 13.2. p

> Only 4.7 per cent said they
expected to participate in a cam-
pus demionstraition, while 30.8
per cent expected to join a fra-
ternity or sorority.

> The top ﬁve majors were
business (16.2 percent), educa-
tion (10.5), engineering (9.5),
ﬁne arts (8.6), and psychology,
sociology or anthropology, 7.8
per cent. Only 1.8 per cent were
undecided about their majors.

YMCA Sponsors Workshop

Thirteen members of the Uni-

in America have.

The workshop, organized and
guided by YMCA Director Frank

David H-copes, and graduate stu-
dent Roger ‘Saimrnotns, was held
at Forest Park Lodge, Somer-

In a series of private and
group discussions, the partici-

topics concerning the problems
and importance of effective com-

How? Well, take Ford Motor Company. We’re a giant

Needing big solutions. Better ideas. And that’s where you
come in. Because it all adds up to a real opportunity for young
engineering graduates like yourself at Ford Motor Company.

Come to work for us and you‘ll be a member of a select
College Graduate Program. As a member of this program,
you won't be just another “trainee”
“make work" assignments: ' ,.

Youlll handle important projects that you’ll frequently
follow from concept to production. Projects vital to Ford.
And you’ll bear a heavy degree of responsibility for their

playing around with

You may handle as many as 3 different assignments in
your ﬁrst two years. Tackle diverse problems. Like ﬁguring
how high a lobe on a cam should be in order to yield a certain
compression ratio. How to stop cab vibration in semi-trailer

Soon you’ll start thinking like a giant. You‘ll grow bigger
because you've got more going for you.

STRAIGHT
TALK

by Jay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

IS PITT SINKING OR SWIMMING?

A national champion swimming team should be as nat-
ural for Pitt as, say, a championship football team is for
Green Bay. But it isn’t. For several reasons the minuses
out number the pluses for the people who care about the
swimming program.

 

 

Two people who care are new head coach Bill Grant
and young assistant coach Jerry Snyder. Grant inherited
a basic problem from interimc-oach Snyder who in turn
had inherited it from ex-swim coach Ben Grady, i.e. the
problem of limited manpower. Deﬁicient recruiting during
   t V Grady’s last years has wiped
out the beneﬁts of the Trees
Pool facility and has brought
about this year’s acute short-
age of swimmers.

GRANT HAS but eight
swimmers and three divers
to use during a meet. Yet
despite the bleak situation,
neither coaches nor team
members have given up on
the season. The dedication
of any swimmer to his sport
is remarkable; the dedica-
tion of the swimming team’s
11 members is truly fantas-
tic. A '

For example, Rich Fry
.. ‘  a--— - swims the breaststroke.

JERRY SNYDER However, because of . the
shortage of backstrokers, Fry has recently learned to swim
that stroke too. He can be seen backstroking in a far co-r-

 

V . ner of the pool, often two hours before practice starts. Fry

has a lot to learn, but he adds another body for an event.

Against Bucknell last Saturday, Howie Norris swam
the 1000 yard freestyle, the 200 yard freestyle, and with
15 minutes rest, proceeded to plow through the water for
his best time of the season in the 200 yard butterﬂy.

“THE KIDS are out to win,” said Snyder. “There’s no
doubt about that. .If you asked them before each meet about
their chances, I’d bet everyone of them would say we’d win.”

Snyder explained that things can’t get any worse. With
14 freshman swimmers, a full year of recruiting ahead in-
stead of only a few months, and more exposure of Pitt's po-

,tential in intecollegiate swimming, the future has to be
the most certain of all Pitt I

sports.

“We can’t do everything
in one year,” Snyder point-
ed out. But the consensus
seems to indicate that the
takeoff point will be reach-
ed in two years, after which
Pitt will begin to establish
the reputation that sur-
rounds swimming schools
Indiana,
Princeton, and Michigan.

ACCORDING TO Grant,
the pluses will then dwarf
the minuses. “We unques-
tionably have the ﬁnest
swimming facility in the
country; in the country," he
emphasized. “Any coach
would give his right arm to have the long course we have,

or the diving towers over 16 feet of water.”

Grant revealed that he has sent a letter to the NCAA,
with the intention of acquiring the NCAA championships
for the near future. On the local level, Pitt hosts the WPIAL
and City championships, as well as the Western regionals
for the state high school championships. This gives Grant
21 signiﬁcant advantage in recruiting, as well as aiding his

Homecourt Big Edge

Cagers Visit WVU Tonight  

by MIKE BROURMAN, Assistant Sports Editor
Hot Rod Hundley, former basketball player turned
sportscaster, was doing the commentory during the West
Virginia-Davidson game Saturday, and he mentioned the
Mountaineer’s home count advantage. ‘‘I wouldn’t,’’ said Hundley,

   

“play down here with a weak heart.” .
The statistics back up Hundley’s jibe, as does the Davidson

result. All add up to trouble
for Bob Tim-mon-s and his ﬂoun-
dering cagens tonight in Mor-
gan-town.

During the last 25 years West
Virginia has been the number
two basketball power in the
country, right behind Kentucky.
Much of thatsuccess has been
enjoyed at home, where’ the
Mountaineers lose an average
of only once a year.

Mediocre for most of this sea-
son, West Virginia has found
their home conﬁnes the neces-
sary tonic, as they defeated na-
tionally ranked Davidson, 89-86,
in overtime. Also at home, the
Mountaineers have beaten East-
ern power St. John’s.

Still displeased over the oager’s
terrible performance a g a i n s t
Penn State, Timmons said,
“We’ll have to shoot better
against West Virginia.” That i-s
an understatement. The Pan-
thers shot only 25 per cent
against State, and a repeat per-
formance would be disastrous.

The fact is that the cagers
will have to improve every

phase of their game just to stay
close to the Mountaineers. The
boxing-out and reboundin-g must
pick up to keep Carrie Bailey,
Greg Ludwig and Dave Reaser
from dominating the boards.

Bailey, a junior college trans-
fer, is touted as one of the best
leapers in the country. Reaser
has always enjoyed great games
against the Panthers.

But the big man for the
Mountaineers is 6’2” guard Ron
Williams, and it will take an
improved defense to stop him.
Williams is the star in what has
almost become a West Virginia
tradition—-the playmaki-ng, good
shooting backcourt man. Hund-
l-ey was the ﬁrst, then Jerry
West, Rod Thorn, and now Wil-
liams.

Tirnmons’ starting lineup is
still in doubt. But, Whoever plays
will have to be more aggressive
than the oagers have been in
their last fou:r defeats. Other-
wise, the Panthers will be just
another flock of sheep in the

’1=ion’s den at Morgantown.

  Cubs Can Even Record  
Against West Virginia .

by JERRY GRUEBEL

It would be “hard to imagine any team wanting to dupli-
cate the feats of v the varsity basketball team. But for to-
night’s game in West Virginia it wouldn’t be a bad idea for
the freshman team to do just that. 0

Earlier in the season, the varsity sported a 1-2 mark,

yet upset highly-regarded Temple to even their record.

Tonight, the Cubs carry a
-.similar 1-2 record to Morgan-
town, W. Va. And the WVU
frosh are expected to be strong.

“It should be a good, tough
game,” explained freshmen bas-
ketball coach Tim Grgurich.

The Little Mountaineers have
played three games at home
this season, winning all of them.
And the Cubs will have to 

rtain some of WV U’s promising"

recruits to ruin the perfect slate.

Skip Kintz, a 6-6 high school

All - America from Allentown,
Pa., leads the teams with a 30
point scoring average. Three
other Little Mountaineers are
in double ﬁgures: Bob Lowe,
19.6; Dick Symons, 14.3; and
Tom Turner, 10.6. Turner has
been shooting 70 per cent from
the ﬂoor.
I WVU freshman coach Chuck
Winsor is pleased with his
tea.m’s offensive play. They have
been averaging 92 points per
game. But the Little Mountain-
eers have disappointed Winsor
on defense by giving up 81
points per game.

“We've proven we could score
but we’ve got a lot of work to
do on defense,” explained Win-
sor. “When we. play good de-
fense we seem to be controlling
the game better. The reb-ound-
ing has got to improve.”

On the other hand, Grgurich
is pleased with the Cubs’ defen-
sive play but disappointed by
their offense.

‘‘They’ve been shooting very
poorly,” Grgurlch said, upset at

   
 

  

Salter ]umps

To Daylight

Track coach Jim Banner is
still bubbling over the perfor-
mances of freshman track phe-
noms Jerry R.-ichey and Bryant
Salter at Navy last weekend.

Richey, who ran Pitt's fast-est‘
- mile in 4:11.3, was never pushed.

The closest runner to him ﬁn-
ished the race in 4:28. Ban-ner
believes Richey, with just one
race behind him, can run a 4:05

. right now. Richey will get his

chance Saturday at the Field
House against Kent State.

Salter left all his competition
behind in the high jump as he
easily cleared 6-8. Instead of ad-
.vancing the bar one inch to 6-9,
Salter took a crack at 6-10. “He
cleared the bar with room to
spare,” Banner indicated, “but
his ankle nicked it on the way
down.” The coach was so en-
thused over Salter’s jumping
that he said ‘‘don’t be surprised
when he hits seven feet.”

In all, eight new freshman
records were set ourt of the 11
first places gained at Navy.

Miami Named Top Opponent

 

Pitted against many of
the nation’s top teams in
1967, the Panther football
team decided the toughest of
them all was not Notre Dame or
Penn State, but in-stead a team
that wound up with a rather dis-
appointing 7-4 record, Miami of
Fl-orida.

In a special vote, the Panither
players named Mi-ami by a large
margin as the Most Outstanding
Team they faced in 1967. The
vote should come as no surprise
to fans who saw the Hurricanes
rip Pitt, 58-0, enroute to a 7-3
regular season record and a
berth in the Blue Bonnet Bowl.

In addition, the players named
Miam.i’s All-American defensive
end, Ted Hendricks, as the Top
Lineman and the most outstand-
ing Player they faced all year.
Navy quarterback John Cart-
wright was voted as the Out-
standing Back.

Dorms Open Basketball Season

 

Wednesday, January 17, 1968 -- THE PITT NEWS —- Page 11

 

Keystone, Mad, Panther, Stratford Win Games

by ED CONLEY

Keystone House almost
needed only one player as
they squeeked out a 39-88
victory over Random House
in ope.ning the Dorm League
“A” basketball season Monday.
Other “A” games saw Stratford
House bomb Hawthorne House,
66-26, and Pleasure Palace take
a forfeit decision from Play-
boy’s Penthouse.

League “B” also began its
chase with Panther House roll-
inig over Sutherland House, 45-
24; Mad House toiplping Litch-
ﬁeld, 37-20, and Peanuts Ga-llery
taking the House of Lords, 34-21.

The one man for Keystone
was Dave Taub. His team trail-
ed at halftime by an 18-15 score,
but he had scored all 15 Key-
stone points. This was not
enough for Mr. Taub. He came
back for 18 more points in the
ﬁnal hialf, totaling 33. Six points
added by his teammates made
the effort a successful one. Ray
Co-ok led the Random players

strength all over the court as
they jumped off to a 35-14 half-
time lead. They continued this
domination in the second half
and their lead was never threat-
ened. The winners spread the
points out pretty evenly as Greg
Ellis and Dave Drake lead the
scoring with 12 and 13 points,
respectively. -Rick Vvaggoner of
Hawthorne took the over-all
scoring honors with 19 of his
team’s 26 points.

The Pa1ace’s vicitory came
when none of the Playboys
showed up for their 5:30 p.m.
tilt.

Panther’s easy win in “B"
oame after a big 25-11 halfway
lead was built up. John Cassian
led the way, scoring 19 and
Mike Deeb of Sutherland came
in with 11, scoring almost half
of his team’s points.

Mad House and Litchﬁeld pla.y-
ed defense throughout their
game, particularly in the open-
ing stanza. The score was only
10-6 in favor of Mad after the
ﬁrst half. The defenses let up
slightly in the second half, es-
pecially Litchﬁeld’s, , as Mad
scored almost twice as much as
the losers in that ﬁnal half. Len
Harmon and George Pribish,
both from Mad, -shared the scor-
ing honors, chipping in 11 points
each.

Peanuts also won a defensive
battle, controlling the Lords’ of-
fense throughout. A second half
offensive scoring spurt by the
Peanuts pulled out the victory.
The top point-getters were Clhuck
Cricks, Guy Kedzierski, and Tom
Carpenter. These three scorin-g
leaders, all from the Peanut’-s
squad, could manage only six

sATTENTION.!

points apiece.
