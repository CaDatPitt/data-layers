Those unusual sounds emanating
from the Men’s Tuck Shop at pre-

electrocuted before he has had a
chance to see “Counsellor-at—Law,”
Player production, which will be pre-
sented Thursday and Friday at Foster
Memorial.

Lest year more timid souls be
afraid to enter said Tuck Shop, Leo
Harter, C42, publicity manager, hast-
ens to assure you that the chair is
only make—believe, and that the only
persons who might suffer will be
those who do not listen to the ad-

“Football lVent Backto the Students Thursday Night,’

Chancellor 'Bowman Says in Exclusive Interview

By Lewis Riley

“Football «went back to the studerrgts Thursday night.

it belongs.” . 9

There is where

Thus Chancellor John G". Bowman last Friday answered the question

of the week, a question that looms
asked:

“When the explosive train of
University come to be recorded,
what emphasis will be placed on
the SFA football banquet of No-
vember 30, 1939?

The SFA banquet will stand out
sharply in the history of the Uni-
versity, the Chancellor believes. It
will stand out as “a spontaneous ex-
pression of student goodwill toward
a football team and coach,” said the
Chancellor, as he leaned back be-
hind his thick oak desk peering in-
to a misty, December smog, that
was closing about his “dream Ca-

If the Chancellor had been in an
opposite corner of the Cathedral he
may have caught sight of the dim
outline of the massive, concrete
Stadium retreating into the semi-
darkness, a mass of concrete that
has been the crux of a twenty-
year problem on the most-publi-
cized college campus in the coun-
try. - C ' ‘ .

believe that the spirit demonstrated
‘at Thursday’s banquet can be
maintain_‘ed.«:if.— Pitt shows up with ‘a A
losing team, a team whose record
may show four and possibly more
defeats in future years?
Game for Students"

The answer is an emphatic “Yes.”
“We want good coaching and all
that,” said the Chancellor in answer
to repeated queries, “but we want
most of all that football be a game
for students. If we’re smart
enough,” he said, “we can keep last
Thursday’s spirit here at the Uni-
versity.”

“Playing football .‘for fun’ does
not mean playing with carelessness
and - indifference,” declared the
Chancellor, “it means rather put-

_.-v.

This "is his answer. to the charge
that football is about to go into the
“softy stage” at Pitt.

,Rig_id rules of sportsmanship and
eligibility will not lessen the cali-
ber of Pitt football teams, Chan-
cellor Bowman believes. The adop-
tion of Code Bowman says the
Chancellor means simply “that our

V players will be playing with other
teams which are abiding by the
same rules of sportsmanship.” This
is the basis of the Chancellor’s long
struggle on athletic policy.

‘‘If other colleges wouldn’t take
their teams from this district, we

' would have a team that could beat

Today: The Women
Cast: University Coeds

Women rule the campus today for twenty-four
hours as the annual VVoman’s Day is celebrated. A
tea in the Commons Room and the Inter-class Sing
highlight the day, this one day out of the whole
year set aside to honor the entrance of women into
the University more than 40 years ago.

Tying for top honors at graduation in 1898 were
the Stein sisters, the only two Women at that time
in the undergraduate school. Although coeds no
longer take all the highest honors scholastically,
perhaps they do in other ways.

Class organization among the women follows a
deﬁnite plan. Each upper class, sophomore, junior,
and senior, has its own oﬂicers and committees,
nominated according to merit by a group of their
own class mates and elected by the whole class.
..-The Women meet together, hold teas and luncheons,
and compete against each other, class against class,
whether in a contest for the Interclass Sing cup or
in the collection of money for a silver tea-service.

Freshmen, of course, are organized in a slightly
diﬁerent manner. Through their mentor groups
and units they are enabled to spend their first ;_vea.1f
in getting acquainted with each other as  as
with the University. Even they, however,_ have in
the Unit Advisory Council an executive group for
the class. .

It is quite ﬁtting, then, for the women, til he hon-
ored today. They have achieved a deﬁnite place
in campus life in the years since the Stein sisters
entered WUP. And yet those years have been
among the most important in the history of the
University.

Women can scarcely be called newcomers to the
school. Nevertheless, it is ﬁtting to coiigratulate
them upon the progress they, and the Whole Uni-
versity, have made since their entrance almost a
half century ago. \

‘Union Now’ --- Another
Fantastie Proposal?
During the ﬁrst "World War, former President

iTaft startled the world with a proposal for a

League of Nations which would serve as an arbi-
trating group for international disputes. Today,
with Europe in the midst of another “VVorld War,”
the ineffectiveness of that league has been proved.

Yet, in spite of that failure,,men are still pre-
senting plans to prevent another Versailles Treaty
-and_a.nother war. A few of them still think that
theonly solution for world peace is some kind of
an international union.

Chief among these proponents is Clarence Streit,
former foreign correspondent for the New York
Times, and author of “Union Now,” a plan for a
union of. democracies, who spoke Friday’ at the
Stephen Foster Memorial. - 

In the early days of our own country which was
trying something new in government, there were
many who scorned the proposals of the advocates
of a union of states. To them, as Mr. Streit said,
such an idea was wilder than any fiction.

Last Thursday, Russia pushed the European war
further toward universality by her attack on Fin-
land. At a time like this, a- proposal for a union

' of democracies seems fantastic.

_ Disregarding this pessimistic note, to us who
live _in the twentieth century and have seen the
visions of the radio, of television, and of the air-
plane materialize, Mr. Streit’s plan should not seem
so fantastic. There have been too many “It can ’t
be done” statements disproved for us to add an-

{other to the list.

Safety and Crime Get
Promotion Campaigns

A familiar American custom isthat of conduct-
ing one—week drives to make the public conscious of
the newest, biggest, and best products or ideas
which can be promoted. Anything from Washing-
ton apples to the United States postofﬁce may be

‘publicized by a Week on behalf of “An Apple a
Day” or “VVrite a Letter Home.”

the slogan “When you walk, when you drive, stay
alive.” The Public Affairs commission of the
YMCA is sponsoring a week of meetings devoted to
study of “Crime——the.war in the United States.”

SFA’S safety campaign, conducted in _coopera- 

tion with the Better Traiﬁc committee of the city
of Pittsburgh, includes a number of featureswhich
are new to the University. Chairman Dave Buente
has scheduled a play to be presented tonight over
radio station KQV, and a special ﬁlm for the
Essefay theater on Thursday afternoon.

District attorney Andrew T. Park and inspector
of detectives Walter Monaghan are the best-known
names on the program of the YMCA Crime clinic.
Chairman Dick Jones is also bringing to campus
for the crime study the psychologist of \Vestern
Penitentiary and the organizer of “Hill City.”

In these campaigns for trafﬁc safety and a
study on ‘_‘ the war against society,” the University
has two worthwhile programs which should'rece‘i’ve
student support.

Streit Points to America
As Basis of New Union

By Jack Brady

Basing his argument for complete union of the 15
outstanding democracies on the trend of the history of
our own country, Clarence Streit, author of “Union
Now” in speaking at Foster Memorial on Friday after-
noon declared that the American people are the only
persons who are qualiﬁed to start this unionization plan.

“America is the only country which has successfully
been governed under a democracy for the past 150 years,
but world aﬁairs during the past 25 years have been
characterized by wars, booms, inﬂations, depressions,
armament races and ﬁnally this second world war has
come,” said Mr. Streit.

Sees World ‘Crash’

He maintains that unless something is done about
this deplorable situation, “we are going to crash.”

Within ten years after the league of friendship had
been established among our own 13 so—ca1led states in
1787, Mr. Streit pointed out that 11 territorial disputes
arose and arguments among the states were prevalent.

“This condition was relieved of approaching tension
when a real union system developed. The numerous
tariffs were abolished in favor of one tariff on free trade.
One national army replaced the 13 independent armies
 better transportation facilities and postal services
were arranged for by the cooperation of the states,” ex-
plained Mr. Streit.

Advantages in Union

Trade. quadrupled among the states after this more
closely knit alliance had been-made and relation ran “on
a  spieother track.”

Mr. St-reit believes that his union should follow the
same  as that used by the above mentioned states,

In response to the belief that organization should
Start among the European nations Mr. Streit explained
“that you begin to develop a plan with people‘ who have
been familiar with that plan and it is difﬁcult to start
with people who have not been practicing the art of
self-go_ve_rn_ment during recent years.”

There are many advantages on the side of the union-
ized countries, he pointed out. In territory we would
have half of Europe and would control the waterways of
the world. Sixty per cent of the world’s necessary ma-
terials for war would be controlled by the Union.

‘Not Closed Corporation’

“This is not proposed as any closed corporation,” he
explained, “but as a nucleus to start world government
because it has to be started on some effective basis to
get out of world anarchy.”

It should be built on the expanding plans on which
the government of the United States is based.

“Before the start Of the present war people were
talking of a Federal Union of Democracies. . Individual
freedom will advance only when individual responsi-
bility stands up for what it believes to be right,” con-
tinued Mr. Streit.

Here we sit with pen poised trying to write, but
nothing comes out . . . it’s a. dry season. But wet or
dry, people are people, things happen, and life chases
merrily along. The Phi Delts might be ahead in intra-
mural competition, but they’re losing out to the PiKA’s
in the Zeta ﬁeld. Monday nights ﬁnd the ZTA’s and
the PiKA’s meeting and twoing by way of a certain drug
store.

Date Bureau

Tommy Stevenson and Betty Virginia Dufﬁeld are
the most promising product of the date bureau. Louisa
Gabbert says that she is not wearing anyone’s pin nor is
she going steady. This is merely an illusion hanging
about since the days when she belonged to an education
honorary. Strangely enough, the honorary’s pin was an
exact duplicate of those worn by the brothers in one
of our men’s social fraternities.

A recent initiate of the Pi Kappa Alpha house, Bill
Jones, is having a terriﬁc time deciding who should have
his fraternity pin and why. At present it is in the pos-
session of an Etna High school student. We’ve been
wondering what he’s decided to do when his “really
and truly” comes home for Xmas vaca.tion—’cause he
originally promised her the pin! -

New or Cool

While we have guys and while we have gals, we
will have new ones and cool ones. The point is Mary
Gregg and'Al Young have called it quits. Ditto: Dolly
Loew, Pitt’s Merle Oberon, and George Harris, the
would-be Cambridge smoothie. Being a bit optimistic,
though, we would rather consider the new ones. Among

these we have Kay Markell and. Al Dunbar coalish,

Carol Covert and Bob Crawford, and Dottie Thompson.
and Jack Brady newsome. ‘

Here and there: Bob Thurbon’s future depends on a"
decision he will make concerning New Year’s eve. Hank
DeRocher,‘ BMOC of Men’s Council and'Cap and Gown
fame, takes time out to instruct Jane Ulrich in the ﬁner
points of billiards. Marion Briney and Dave Pinkerton,
a Tech grad of "two years ago, have announced their in-1
tention of becoming permanent.

Panther Man Miller

Estelle Stout and Dick Kaye are becoming a deﬁnite
pair. Frank Miller ventures forth from the Panther
Office looking like a writer with a Greenwich village
background—the literary bug has him looking the part.
Jane Scott, secretary in the oﬁice of the dean of women,
will be married on December 30 to Jack Douglass. Bob
Good is anxiously awaiting the return of blonde Lois
Hershey from New York for the Xmas holidays.

Women’s Day

Jack Burton bought a new car while waiting for
Betty Langguth to get out of fraternity meeting last
Monday night. Jack Hocveler is peddling sausage
again: Grace Fagan likes to be called Gay. Peggy
Mesee is wearing a Phi Gam pin. And we’re running
out of ink! ’

55 Members of Pitt Band

Organize New Concert Group

Chosen because of their musical
ability, approximately ﬁfty-ﬁve men
from the marching unit of the Pitt
Band will make up the Pitt Concert
Band, which starts work this Week.
The band will be under the baton of
Robert L. Arthur; Cliif Carlson, C40,
will assume the duties of student di-
rector and manager of the organi-
zation.

To bring a higher grade of band
music to as many people as possible
is the chief purpose of the Concert
Band. To this end, concerts to be
given in many- city high schools
have been scheduled throughout the
months of January and February.
During the months of March and
April, the band will. make short one
night concerttrips to various places
within a nearby radius. The big
‘trip of the season will come this
year during spring vacation, when
the band makes a week’s concert
tour, playing in most of the Middle-
Atlantic states.

FROM THE

SI DELI NBS

By BILL McELWAIN
Sports Editor

J OTS AND DASHES: At least
two of Pitt ’s opp.onents this past
season thought well of the Pan-
thers Temple placed three
of Charley Bowser’s charges on
their all-opponent team, while Car-
negie Tech found room for two . . .
Frank Kristufek made both teams
. . . Ben Kish was honored by the
Tartans, and Temple liked Dick Cas-
siano and Johnny Dickinson.

Bill McJunkin, student assistant
(Stooge) to publicity man Frank
Carver, was at Pennsy station to
meet the boys when they came back
from State . . . and to keep intact
a recor-d of ﬁve years in which he
has been around for the departure
and arrival of the football -I-team on
all their trips out of town . . . rum-
ors that McJunkin and his shadow,
Andy Ferguson, were brought here
as student aides by Dr. Bowman in
1921 are unfounded and malicious.

In case you hadn’t noticed, the
athletes are taking» over ODK . . .
with the tapping of Pat Cusick, John
Dickinson, Al McKee, George Hart-
man, and Emil Narick, there is a
total of seven varsity men in the
organization . . . Cassiano and the
football-playing Kristufek are the
other two.

There’s still a college hockey
league in Pittsburgh . . . Carnegie
Tech and Duquesne will continue the
sport in conjunction with four Ohio
schools, Case, John Carroll, Baldwin-
Wallace, and Western Reserve . . .
this leaves the old Ohio-Penn league
shy two members, Fenn and Pitt.

Jimmy Potts, head man up in in-
tramural headquarters, reports that
the entries for the winter program
indicate a new high in intramural
participation . . which seems to
prove that this Potts man is really
getting somewhere in his “athletics
for all” drive.

‘Congratulations to the new touch
football champs, the Punks, are in
order after the way they manhandled
the pride of the frats, Phi Gamma
Delta, last Friday . . . the Punks
belie their name with a seven-star
offense and a ﬁne defense . . . nom-
ination for their forgotten man: Rip
Collins, smashing lineman who
spent most of the season breaking
up the gilt-edged scoring plays of
the opposition.

Favorable comments on the foot-
ball banquet contine to trickle in
. . . Patsy Grifi‘Lth’s outburst brought
applause from everyone but Jack
Sell and Eddie Beachler, Post Ga-
zette and Press Writers respective-
ly . . . no doubt only their profes-
sional training kept them from join-
ing in the ovation . . . “too many
movies” was the lone student com-
plaint after the affair . . everyone
wanted to see the Demonstration
Block ﬁlms though.

Highlight of the evening was the
band’s “Oh, Johnny,” directed at Dr.
Bowman . . . we -can’t speak for the
Chancellor but the Students feel it
went a long way toward making him
“one of the boys” . . . and as some-
one remarked later, “You cant be
m.ad at anyone you call ‘Johnny’.”

Punks Defeat F IJIS,

20-7,

To Clinch All-Intramural

As Phi Gam Attack Stalls in Final

By Alex Zelenski

Held on even terms in the ﬁrst half,
the Punks came through with two
touchdowns in the last quarter to
win the intramural touch football
championship, 20-7.

Two minutes after the opening
kickoff, “Christy” Watson, Phi Gams
backﬁelder completed three succes-
sive passes, the ﬁnal one to Jack Eitel
for the first touchdown. Watson then
addedthe seventh point by kicking
the extra point.

Tied at Half

The Punks, with “Lefty” Ziolkow-
ski leading the offense, tied the score
via a long 40-yard pass to “Red”
Port. Ziolkowski had ﬁne blocking
on the play by Sam Milanovich, and
Port made a spectacular catch as he
outmaneuvered two men for the
touchdown. George Kocheran threw
a pass to Milanovich for the extra
point.

At half time the score stood 7-7.
The Phi Gams were holding their
highly touted favorites, and the ﬁg-
ures gave them a slight advantage.

Kocheran Intercepts Pass

In the second half, “Lefty” Ziol-
kowski returned the opening kickoff
to midﬁeld from where he then threw
a 30-yard pass to “Red” Port on the
15-yard line. After two uncompleted
paasses, Jack Scherer caught the ball
in the end zone for their second tally.
An offside penalty was called on the
attempted extra point and the score
remained 13-7.

The spirited fraternity boys came
back after the Punk touchdown, and
drove to the basketeers one-yard line.
Lady Luck then stepped in as the Phi
Gains, with fourldowns to go, had
their shovel pass intercepted in the
end zone by George Kocheran who,
aided by Ralph Josephs’ blocking, ran
the length of the ﬁeld for the ﬁnal
score of the game. The extra point
was added as Kocheran tossed a
basketball pass to Mel Port.

Port Great Receiver

Port was the outstanding pass re-
ceiver on the ﬁeld as he time and
again caught passes from the arm
of Ziolkowski. “Lefty” Ziolkowski
returned to form, and he consistently
found his receivers with passes.
K.ocheran’s dash across the ﬁeld was
the most spectacular play of the
game. This run proved to be the
turning point of the game. Sam Mil-
anovich and Jack Sherer were out-
standing on defense.

Watson’s passing again was the
mainstay of the Phi Gam team.
“Christy” was under a disadvantage
as he did not have the proper block-
ing that is required for accurate
passing. Bill, Edmunds teamed with
Watson and played good ball both on
the defense and on the offense.

The game proved to be one of the

most interesting and thrilling of the
current play offs. It pitted ‘together
the inter-fraternity champions, the
Phi Gains, and the independent

proved their right to the All-intra-
mural crown by their splendid 20-7
victory over the Phi Gams.

By Phil Lynch

Jovial. Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, an
outstanding “say so” on the popular
indoor sport and Pitt’s well liked
ﬂoor mentor, is one coach who re-
fuses to accept standards in basket-
ball and will go out of his way to im-
prove his cherished sport. As ener-
getic as a little mite under a micro-
scope lens, he delves into basketball
problems always trying to perfect a
better game.
Twenty Inch Hoop

This year, the rosy cheeked doctor
is aiding Bill Edwards of the Univer-
sity of Missouri in experimenting
with a 20-inch basket, a rim two

inches larger in diameter than the ‘

standard size. According to Edwards,
the new hoop is._ an idea to replace
“Fog” Allen’s conception of the high-
er basket.

Both theories aim to eliminate the
clogging of the center lane so that a
tall man will not have the distinct ad-
vantage he holds now, and the zone
defense will be less eﬁective. -

One can easily understand the dif-
ficulties a white rat has when phy-
chologists toss him in a complicated
maze, for the tabulations are intri-
cate enough to give a CPA a lot of
trouble, even if he received his diplo-
ma from Pitt.

Takes '75 Shots

Ten universities, from the sun
baked hills of California to the water
kissed shores of Florida, are lending
a hand in the experiment. Each
school tabulates 7,000 shots taken
from a 30 degree angle, a~45, and a 60.

The players,‘ of which there were
seven at Pitt, pitches 75 shots from
all three angles at varying distances:
10 ft., 20 ft., 25 ft’., 30 ft., and 35 ft.

He takes the same number of shots
from the same distances from the
same angles at both» the 18 inch bas-
ket and the 20 inch one. Thus, from
comparison of the attempts, a per-
centage can be set up and the efficien-
cy of the larger hoop can be tabu-
lated. ‘ 7' "

By all rights, the efficiency should

DR.i H. C. CARLSON
experimenting

graduate as the shots are taken from
longer distances, for this is the ob-
ject of the whole experiment. But
Pitt ﬁgures show that the efﬁciency

drops after the 20" foot shot from 50 .

per cent down to 16 per cent.

This drop should not-occur, and the
reason for its sharp fall is unknown.
It is possiblethat the shooter has not
the range from 20 ft. The percent-
age rises at 30ft. to 49 per cent, then
falls abruptly once again at the 35
foot distance to 37 per cent.

Test Fallable __

The test is then fallable, and suffi-
cient calculation can prove whatever
you" want it to prove. For if you
match the distances, the ratio of per-
centage increases readily. For in—-
stance, pairing up the 10 and 15 ft.
shots. the,20,..and,25, t1}e._.30 .a;,nc,1,. 3;,
you ﬁnd a constant increasing ratio."

It rises from 24 per cent to 33 per

cent to 43 per cent. If you compute
the last three distances, you ﬁnd a 34
per cent improvement. which is but
one per cent better than the common
mean, or the common improvement
which is 33.7 peirfcent. Thus, from
comparison of ﬁgures,‘ you can make
your experiment prove anything you
want. _- 3,:-,‘;;‘> V:
In Embryo Stage  

One common fact however. is that
there is a decided increase in accur-
acy from the 10 foot line back, but
within that radius there is an equal-

gy f}om":lu.3ions\

[to 9:30 there will be- a swimming

one, high enough to exceed‘ the stand-
ard one by 33 per cent.

 You may say, “Well, that’s ﬁne, but
what the heck good is it?” and you

would be =lOglCal." The test is now in 

its embryo stage and it is conceived

by men who ardently try to improve

the indoor sport'which. already at-”

tracts more fans than any other com-'

petitive game. ’ .
Probably little, action will be af-
fected by the survey, and yet there is

the slim possibility that there may. 

It woulddo much toward making the
zone defense less eﬁective, would re-
sult in a high scoring game. Big men
would go out of style as much as
handle-bat mustaches did way back
then.

More Long Shots

More attention would be directed .

toward the shooting-of long shots, and
less attention to the intricate plays
which block and screen men out of
play, so that the offense may get a
shot under the hoop.

As was mentioned before, “Fog”
Allen has been trying to introduce a
higher basket to rid the efficiency of
a tall man while Missouri’s Edwards
is in favor of ridding the tall man but
widening the basket.

It is probable that a system will be
devised in the near future to do
something about the exceptionally
tall man. As proof of what a lanky

Annual Winter
Meetings N car
For Conference

Special to The Pitt News

CHICAGO, Ill., Dec. 4.-Annual
winter meetings of the Western Con-
ference December 8 and 9 will hold
the attention of University of Pitts-
burgh athletic officials, who have
identiﬁed their own program with the
standards administered by the Big
Ten.

Pittsburgh’s athletic program has
been brought under the surveillance
of the Big Ten in the last year by a
courtesy agreement. While the school
has no official status in the Confer-
ence, Big Ten officials have agreed
to include discussions of Pittsburgh’~s
activities as they administer their
own policies.

is accomplished by mutuality. With-
out employing a scout or “police-
man,” reports ‘of the violation of
Conference standards and codes are
forwarded by member schools to a
central office, which refers the ques-
tion to the school involved for inves-
tigation and reply.

ference school have standing requests
of their staffs to report to them any
suggestions of violations by any mem-
ber school which the staff members

' may have encountered in their num-

erous contacts.

According to its arrangement with
the Conference, Pittsburgh enjoys the
beneﬁts of that procedure as reports
of its activities are also to be sub-
mitted.

In addition to Big Ten eligibility
standards to which Pittsburgh sub-
scribes, it has made itself a voluntary
subject to the agreement of Confer-
ence athletic directors on recruiting

- and subsidizing, one of the most rigid

and comprehensive codes of its kind
on record.

Pittsburgh’s close relationship with
the Big Ten has been reflected fur-
ther in its presence on the schedules
of Conference teams in increasing
frequency, notably Ohio State, In-
diana, Purdue and Minnesota.

Tips on All-American Selections

By Bill Mazefsky ' ,
Have you selected your All-American football team yet, or are you a

If you are a sensitive soul this article is not for you. If you intend to
select an All—American team (Editor’s note:

This article is still not for you)

To select your All-American team you certainly should follow. some

nitely say that some of the All—Amer-
ican boards use the rules which we
are about to set down, still, perusal
of their results has led us to suppose
that they certainly must use simil-
ar standards.

We set down certain rules and as-
sure you that if you follow these rules
you will come up with an interesting
All-American team.

1.. If at the beginning of the sea-
son you realize that the urge to se-
lect an all-star team will smite you
at the end of the season, attend as few
ganies " as possible. (Ed B-allinger,
leading Post-Gazette football yogi,
hasn’t seen a football game in years.
Then there’s J aﬁe, the Pitt News yogi
who sees but doesn’t recognize.)

2. Keep your mind off Chicago.

3. Learn how to spell words like
Wojie-something. (Remember the
guy with the euphonistic name who
used to corrupt enemy backﬁelds for
Fordham?)

4. Don’t read cynics like Henry
McLemore.

Coach Grady Gives
Swimmers Workout

If anyone is wondering why the
members of the varsity swimming
team walk out of Tree’s every day
with those exhausted lookson their
faces, the answer is their new coach,
Ben Grady.

He is really making the boys work,
and what’s more, they like it. They

Included on the varsity this year
are Orloff, Samson, Cosgrove, and

correlate the material presented dur-

cussion of the present day crime situ-
ation, Jones states. '

This will be the ﬁrst attempt of the
public affairs committee to sponsor a
series of programs on crime. Plans to
make the institute an annual part of
the University YMCA program are
being considered, Harold Viehman,
acting secretary of the YMCA reveals.

In attacking the subject of crime
in such a short period, Jones points
out that students should ﬁnd the di-
vision of the program into discussion
of juvenile, adolscent, and adult crim-
inality an aid to a clearer understand-
ing of the problem of crime and its
prevention.

Bulletins carrying crime “do you
know” facts will be posted at several
key points in the Cathedral, announc-
es Ralph Kallock, C42.

Members of the public affairs com-
mittee include beside Jones and Kal-
lock, John Brosky, C42, John Burn-

Students Dislike
Hitch-Hike Law

By Student Opinion Surveys
AUSTIN, TEXAS, November 29-—
Four out of every ﬁve collegians op-
pose laws restricting hitch-hiking,

‘according to a poll by student Opin-

ion Surveys of America conducted for
the News and 1,500 other college
papers.

According ‘to the poll, nationally ‘

students voted 80 percent to 20 per-
cent against any ban on highway
travel by thumbing, and college stu-
dents are probably the largest group
using this form, of travel.
'S,ou'thern collegians voiced the
strongest opposition, and New Eng-
landers were most in favor of for-
bidding hitchiking. Signiﬁcant is

lthe fact that New Englanders are

among the more wealthy students.
There only 30 percent o.f the men
and 20 percent of the women have
to work for all or part of their col-
lege expenses. In the nation as a
whole, nearly ﬁve out of every ten
students hold some kind of a job.

Writer Discusses Abstract Art
Display in U niéversity Galleries

By Anita. Barone

“Classic and Romantic Traditions
in Abstract Painting,” an exhibition
circulated by the Museum of Art,
New York, will open today in the
department of ﬁne arts.

Abstract art today needs no de-
fense. It has become one of the
many ways to paint or carve or
model. It is based upon the assump_
tion that a work of art is worth look-
ing at because it presents a compo-
sition of color, line, light, and shade,

Purpose of this exhibition is to
present a brief historical survey of
the development of abstract art
from its inception in the work of
several painters of the late nine-
teenth century to the present day ab-
stract painting in Europe and Amer-
ica.

The exhibit has been divided in-
to two main traditions of abstract
art. The ﬁrst may be described as
Classic Tradition; it
upon logic and calculation. This
group is represented in the exhibi-
tion by originals of such famous
painters, as Seurat, Cezanne, Picasso,
Braque, Severini.

The second current has its princi-
pal ‘source in the artgpand theories of

fortune on the football turf and at

tional denial by Chancellor Bow-
man.

Declaring that such insinuations
were without basis, the Chancell J1‘
declared “we are willing to alter
our existing code of athletics in
minor details in accordance with
the regulations governing future
Pitt football opponents,” but the
“spirit and principles” of Code
Bowman are to stay, he affirmed.

“I want everything itoigbe wide
open and clear in respect to our ..
athletic policy. I Want to keep

the game on a truly amateur basis
here,” the Chancellor concluded.

Gauguin and his circle, ﬂows
through the work of Matisse to the
abstract expressionism of Kandis-
ky’s pre-war painting, and reap-
pears a few years later with surreal-
ism. I

In contrast to the ﬁrst tradition
the second is institutional and emo-
tional rather than intellectual. It is
represented by original Works of
Gauguin, Von Gogh, Matisse, Miro,
Derain, and Marn'1.

Often the two traditions inter-
mingle, and they may both appear
in one man.

Besides the oil paintings, water-
colors, drawings, prints, and sculp-
ture of well known European and
American artists, the exhibition in-
cludes photographs of the inﬂuence
of abstract art on architecture, fur-
niture, typography, advertising art,
and the ﬁlm.

In addition a small group of Am- ’

erican paintings show the early ex-
perimental work in America and the
steadily growing interest ‘of con-
temporary American artists in ab-
stract art.

The exhibit, which is open to the
public, will continue through De-
cember 22.

Women Redecorate

Thaw Hall Lounge

Drab brown walls and broken down
chairs in the wome_n’s lounge at Thaw
Hall will soon be replaced with a blue
color scheme in chairs, drapes, and
decorations.

Women students who are chemistry
specials, and chemistry and physics
majors decided that the old lounge
was an eyesore. A committee was
appointed to investigate the matter,
and Francis McLaughlin, assistant to
the dean of women, took the commit-

tee on a shopping trip to select the
new furnishings for the room.

Final decision to redecorate the

» room -was made at a luncheon with

Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,
Wednesday. It is hoped that redeco-
ration will be completed by the end
of the Christmas recess.
