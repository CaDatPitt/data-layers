Kimbo Art Gallery displays portraits of lupus

patients to raise awareness of the disease

Staff I/Vriter

Portraitist Virginia Thomas did ‘

not know that she would ﬁnd her
next subject when a couple of
young men knocked on her door
to make a furniture delivery.

__ The men entered her home with
the intention of delivering a me-
dia cabinet. However, entranced
by the murals and paintings scat-
tered about, they stopped to ask if
she would be willing to paint their
pictures.

Thomas agreed, and by pure co-
incidence, she had found the ﬁnal
subject to add to her collection of
portraits of individuals who, like
her, suffer from lupus disease.

Thomas, a current Harrisburg,
Pa., resident originally from Roch-

ester, N.Y., uses her art to spread
lupus awareness. Her traveling
exhibit -— whichwill be on dis-
play in the Conney M. Kimbo Art
Gallery in the William Pitt Union

from Monday, Sept. 3, through '

Thursday, Sept. 20 — includes a
self—portrait as well as 19 portraits
of other subjects, all of whom suf-
fer from the disease.

The exhibit, sponsored by so-
rority Kappa Kappa Gamma and
fraternity Delta Tau Delta, depicts
individuals from all walks of life
living with lupus. The youngest
subject is only 5 years old and the
oldest is 72. -

Lupus is a widespread chronic
autoimmune disease that can cause
inﬂammation in many parts of
the body. The immune system of
a person living with the disease

produces antibodies that cause
subsequent damage to organs and
tissues.

“If left undiagnosed, you’re al-

lowing the body to attack itsel ,” _

Thomaslsaid.

Thomas said that it is particu-
larly vital for college-aged students
to become aware of the disease be-
cause it primarily affects people
from the ages of 15 through 45.
She also said that although men

are at risk for lupus, the majority _

of patients are women.

Despite the fact that women
of color are three to four times
more likely to contract the dis-
ease, Thomas continued, lupus

is still a concern for people of all .

ethnicities.
This diversity is well-repre-

sented in the portrait artist’s work.’

While her subjects have a variety
of ethnic backgrounds, they also
come from all around the North-
east, including Washington, D.C.,
and Pennsylvania.

P Thomas said that she met her
subjects in many different ways.

i “I met them throughneighbors,
my hairdresser, old friends and at
health fairs. I even met one during
a layover in,Germany,” she said.

And the project was still acquir-
ing subjects through February of

this year. A

“That was the most difficult
part for me,” Thomas said. “From a
physical standpoint, it was difficult

to organize everything, including -

travel and ﬁnding sponsors. It was
a lot of busy wor .”

Pitt Dems
canvas to
register
voters

With the Democratic National
Convention taking place this
week in Charlotte, N.C., the Pitt
College Democrats are working
alongside the Obama for Amer-
ica campaign to get students
registered to vote.

The registration drive began
last spring and is at its peak now
as student volunteers stand in
front of class buildings and on
street corners to make sure that
everyone who is eligible to vote
is registered.

' “You have to be registered

by the second week in October,
so we’re really working hard to
make sure that every student is

registered,” said Lara Sullivan, -

president ofPitt College Demo-
crats.

And this active method seems
to be effective. The volunteers
help students through the entire
registration process to make it
as convenient as possible, es-
pecially since a lot of students
are too busy with other work to
fill out the form, Sullivan said.

“We collect the forms and
physically take it to the elec-
tion office for them,” she said.
“That way they don’t have to
worry about postage.”

One student took the oppor-
tunity to register when she was
standing in line at the campus
book center. ‘ ‘

“They just had a clipboard,"
and I registered on the spot,”
freshman Emily Simmons said.

Simmons thought the method

‘of targeting students in large

groups was effective because it
is students who are behind the
drive to get voters registered.
“They’re relatable because
they are students, so it’s not like

LUPUS

Such a physical toll on her body is what
caused Thomas to retire from her work as
a physical therapist. '

“It became too much pain on my joints
and ligaments,” she said.

Thomas said that she hopes her project
will create an atmosphere for discussion
and support within the lupus community.

“If people come in who have lupus, I want
them to see that others are suffering too,”
she said. “I hope it inspires them to be less
afraid to talk about it.”

But the collection is not only for those
who can already relate. Thomas said she
hopes the exhibit will also be meaningful to
those who don’t have the disease.

“I want them to put a face to lupus and
to develop more empathy.”

Nicole Thomas, Virginia’s daughter and a
member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said that
her sorority has similar goals for’ the exhibit.

She explained that her sorority often
develops the idea of supporting a particular
cause because someone within the soror-
ity has a personal involvement with that
organization.

“Everydne in the house knows my mom,”
Nicole Thomas said. “It’s cool to say that
we’re associated with what she’s doing.”

The sorority, in cooperation with frater-
nity Delta Tau Delta, raised close to $700 to
cover the expense of the exhibit.

Nicole said that Kappa Kappa Gamma

teamed up with Delta Tau Delta in Febru-
ary of this year to host a lunchbox auction.
“The girls make or buy lunches, and the
boys each bid on them,” she said.
]eﬁ'Breakey, president of Delta Tau Delta,
said that the lunchbox auction is an annual

tradition.

“This year I bid on homemade lasagna
for about $25,” he said.

Although Breakey has not yet visited the
exhibit yet, he said he plans to gather a group
of brothers to see the project they helped

random adults are coming up to us to ask
if we are registered,” Simmons said. “It
was an easy process.”

Sullivan noted that the group focused

a lot of its efforts toward registering stu-.

dents during the week of freshman ori-
entation by including voter registration
forms in the incoming freshn_1en’s Arrival
Survival packets.

“On our freshman move-in day they
were handing out the forms,” freshman
Alyssa Ardman said. “I was already regis-
tered at home, but I did it again because
they told me I had to be registered at the
campus address.” ’

Ardman said it was helpful that the
volunteers handed out the forms and

made the registration process a lot '

more convenient, noting that she prob-
ably would not have registered to vote
otherwise.

Guiding the Pitt College Democrats in
registering student voters are the work-
ers of Obama for America’s western Penn-
sylvania chapter.

“A lot of the Pitt College Democrats
volunteer for the Obama campaign, so
we’ll offer training on how to register
voters,” said Matt Mittenthal, a spokes-
man for the campaign. “We are leading
a lot of these efforts.”

According to Sullivan, the heavy fo-
cus on registration right now is to make
sure that everyone gets a chance to vote.
She noted that there’s no point in urg-
ing students to vote or campaigning to
students if they are not able to actually
cast their ballots. .

“Registering people to vote is the first

step in encouraging people to vote,” Sul—~

livan said, mentioning that she thought
that if students took the effort to register,
they might be more inclined to vote in
the upcoming election.

Sullivan said that so far the groups’
joint effort has paid off, and the vol-
unteers have succeeded: in registering
hundreds of students in the past two
weeks. The Allegheny County Division
of Elections did not respond to multiple
requests for comment to provide up—to-
date ﬁgures.

  Homelessness in America makes

r us consider, societal failures A

Rosie McKinley
Columnist

I have never much pitied the home-
less. On weekends inNew York Cityas
achild I remember my grandmother
lookingwith disdain at the men sleep-
ing on the subways. When asked for
money we’d pretend we didn’t speak
English. I often joked that a cold city
like Pinsburgh shouldn’t even have
any homeless people inthe winter-
can’t they just hitchhike their way to
Miami or somewhere warmer? '
This summer I saw my distaste for
the homeless reﬂected in news stories
from around the nation. Philadelphia
mayor Michael Nutter proposed
banning charities from feeding the
homeless in public parks. Across the
country in Berkeley, Calif., similar

discriminatory legislationtowardthe '

homeless is proposed for the Novem-
ber election. Sitting on the sidewalks
could bring $75 ﬁnes, a price most
homeless people won’t be able to pay.
The proposed legislation matches
that of a San Francisco law enacted
two years ago, banning the homeless
from sidewalks and park benches.
These three cities .— Philadelphia,
Berkeley and San Francisco — are
typicallytouted forbeingsocially pro-
gressive. Yet all three cities reﬂect
an American culture traditionally
unsympathetic to the homeless. In
a nation still proud of American ex-
cepﬁonalism, we resenttl1oseincon—
gruous with the narrative of pulling
yourselfup by the bootstraps.

But a recent survey of homeless
teens has me thinking differently
about homelessness in America. Ac-
cording to a study by the National
Science Foundation, most college-

age homeless people use social me-
dia sites like Facebook and Twitter at
rates comparable to college students
(62 percent of homeless -teenagers
own cell phones — smartphones
even — and they are a valuable re-
source for them in connecting with
social supports, according to a 2011
article in The Denver Post). The Twit-
tersphere is not created solely from

not the only way we are similar to the x

COLUMN

In considering society’s . structure, how
a much credit can you take for success?‘

Daniel Okwaisie
For The Pitt News

There is a little tale that Repub-
lican presidential candidate Mitt
Romney has been spreading
around for a while now and, to
paraphrase Mitt, it goes some-
thing like this: In America, if a
kid makes the honor roll, I real-
ize that he got to school on ‘a bus,

S and the bus driver got him there.

But.I4d'~on’t, give the bus driver

credit for the honor roll. I give '

the kid credit for the honor roll,
becausein America we celebrate
individual success.

.Th_is_ symbolic story, ful-
ly imbued with the chime of
American exceptionalism, has
accompanied the presidential
candidate on the road ever since
his incumbent challenger rather

clumsily tried to make the point A

that success is interplay between
society’s collective effort and an
individual’s hard work. Predict-
ably, in this charged political en-

vironment where campaigns are
lurking to attack any gaffes, the
president’s remarks culminated
in a firestorm on the right with
T—shirts and banners being em-
broidered with the words “you
did’ build it” in an attempt ‘to
convince business owners that
the president does not believe
they should take credit for their
own businesses. Though this
dishonest miscqnstruction still
persists, America can be proud
that some _more commendable
fellows decided to.return that
remark to its context, arguing
that it appears much worse in
that light.

Evidently Romney believes
that the president’s remarks
are worse in context. However,
the Republican nominee’s bus
driver story typifies the straw-
man arguments being made to
support that point. Appreciation
is not a zero-sum game where
giving_one side some recogni-
tion means the other becomes

insigniﬁcant; saying the societal
framework in which a person
functions plays a role in indi-
vidual success does not mean the
credit has been stripped from
the individual’s -initiative‘. For
instance, if I said the crowd at
a Pirates game was phenomenal
and helped Andrew Mccutchen
play a stellar game one day, it
wouldn’t mean Mccutchen de-
served no credit for his perfor-
mance. Similarly, recognizing
thatthe bus driver plays a role
in the kid’s being on the honor
roll —— which Romney himself
has — does not invalidate the
kid’s good work. There is enough
credit to go around. '

Zoom out of Romney’s story
though. The truth is that politi-
cians and economists have now
taken on a debate that psycholo-
gists have been having for a cen-
tury or more. Do we succeed pri-
marily because we are born with

inherent qualities, or is success more re-
lated to our environment? If a Pell Grant
funds your education and you stay up un-
til 2 a.m. churning out information from
books, how much credit would you give
yourself for any consequent success? Of
course there are probably a lot of people
on Pell Grants who would not turn out
to be as successful, but if there were no
grants, you probably wouldn’t have the
opportunity to sit up into the wee hours
for a bachelor’s degree. So would you say
it’s 50-50 between the two?

Success is some combination between
nature and nurture, which makes it dif-
ﬁcult to understand why people like Rom-
ney are bent on redefining the “nature”
part of that argument by tearing down
government. Indeed, Julian Sanchez,
a research fellow at the Cato Institute
libertarian think tank and a libertarian
writer, argues that individuals should
realize that collectiveness is important,
but what makes President Barack Obama
think people should have that realiza-
tion through government? Sanchez won-
ders: Why can’t the appreciation for the
societal framework be through our golf
clubs, book clubs and other civic organi-
zations? That argument would probably
carry more weight if book ‘clubs started
building roads, schools and parks all over
America — but they don’t, so that argu-

 

ment is nonsense.

It is one thing to say you don’t trust in
modern governance and a different thing
to say you don’t believe in the concept of
government. If people like Sanchez are
willing to be honest, they will admit that
government has a lot more to do with the

_ surroundings they were born into than

the golf club they joined some 20 years
later. Romney’s story preys on the con-
voluted idea that practical government
cannot perfectly align itself with what
it is supposed to be in theory. But that is
the task he is asking America to trust him
with — to make government as close as
possible to its theoretical goal oflooking
out for the welfare of all.

' Having said that success is some com-
bination between nature and nurture,
there might be an inclination to claim
that this column has centered too much
on supporting the collectiveframework
through government, and indeed it has —
because individual initiative is not under
attack. That happens under despotism.
Rather, it is the collective framework
through government which is under at-
tack because that is what happens when
a bunch of self—serving ideologues get
into positions of influence and try to pull
up the ladder behind them. What would
you say the nature-nurture combination
of success is? Is it 5oT—5o, 60-40, 15-75
or 100-0? I

to Shadyside or Squirrel Hill, just as a homeless
person might use one to enjoy a few hours out
of the elements. The point is, just because the
homeless play a different, marginalized role
in our society does not mean that they are not
indeed a part of it. And that’s why these recent
acts oflegislation across the country from Philly
to Berkeley are so problematic. Too frequently,
laws and ordinances aimed at homeless con-_
cerns don’t aim to ﬁx the problem, they aim to
mask it by harming the homeless from public
spaces like park benches and sidewalks.

Hiding the homeless from the street is like
poppingazit on your forehead instead of adopt-
ing better facial hygiene practices. It makes the
issue temporarily less visible, but it doesn’t ﬁx

A the root of the problem.

It is natural that we should want to hide
homelessness in America. It makes us uncom-
fortable to see a homeless woman curled up in
a comer of Carnegie Library or panhandling
on Forbes Avenue. Homelessness makes us
uncomfortable because itisthe veryvisible sign
of the ways in which our society has failed. In
a_]uly Fox News article about the ban on giving
homeless people food in Philadelphia parks,
one homeless law school graduate asks, “What
are the causesof this problem?”

The homeless make up over 600,000
Americans. From 2005 to 2010, the number

increased by more than 50 percent, in part a

many homeless young adults are the victims of a

Lil Wayne

Dedication 4 i\/lixtape
Grade: B ‘l

Sounds like: The Nanny

meets Ludacns

A few years ago, Lil Wayne
claimed he was the “best rapper
alive!” For those who don’t think
thatthis frequently repeated slo-
gan warranted an exclamation
point, his nasally yell —— remi-
niscent of Fran Fine’s from “The
Nanny” — left us no choice but
to let our eardrums suffer as the
phrase became associated with
the New Orleans native.

Then, times changed. Weezy

was on pace for a VH1 episode,‘

“When Lil Wayne Ruled the
World,” but blew his shot when his
last album, the highly anticipated
“Tha Carter IV,” was scorned by
critics. -
Just like the Barry Bonds home
run record ball, the album'has an
asterisk next to it. Lil Wayne had
only recently returned from a jail
sentence, giving both critics and
fans alike a scapegoat upon which
to blame Wayne’s letdown. After a
few failed attempts at piggyback-
ing on others’ tracks, Lil Wayne
quietly faded into the background
for the ﬁrst time since “Tha Carter
III” dropped in 2008.
 But it now seems Lil
A‘  Wayne has tried to
‘ ‘adopt the motto from

IMPULSE

Lil Wayne’s new album takes away from
his legendary status   -

caught up to him-in his latest
mixtape, Dedication 4, in which
he butchers the immortal words
of a ghostly Babe Ruth.

The album’s title track, “So

, Dedicated (featuring Birdman),”

begins with the Birdman and the
Birdman Jr. who are set up by a
man who sounds as if he is cov-
ering the microphone in spit as
he yells, “This one here, this one
is for the sport!” The sport that
he mentions is the same with
which Lil Wayne made headlines
just under a month ago when he
chose trucks and decks over his
rap career. '
“Some of you mad the current
sport happens to be skateboard-
ing,” yells the ‘unidentiﬁed man,
seemingly knowing he has just
enteredinto one of the biggest
rap debates of the decade thus far.

. - Wasting no time in punctuating

his argument, he continues to his
rebuttal: “But that gives us four

wheels to run over you.” A bass— _

heavy DJ Drama beat drops, and
Wayne enters.

The second track on the album
is just as violent as the ﬁrst. It’s.
all right hooks, no jabs. Either Lil
Wayne has a great sense of irony,
or “Same D*mn Tune,” the second
song, is just a poor choice for -a
name, because much of the song
mimics its predecessor. Revert-
ing back to Lil Wayne’s roots, the
song combines battle rap lines
and bragging without a quotable
line in sight, and Wayne gives the
listener no choice but to hit the
‘next’ button. - ‘ ‘ ‘

‘‘I’m Tunechi / I do me!” he
says, still trying to convince the‘
rap world that it’_s OK to follow,
in Michael_]ordan’s footsteps and
take a brief retirement from his
craft. Unfortunately, it seems
that he has attempted to follow
]ordan’s saga a little too closely,
striking out on countless new ca-
reer opportunities that seem to be
out of his element. Nonetheless,
Dedication 4’s 2 million views
since Monday seem to suggest
that whatever Wayne’s decision
for his future, his fans will give
him a shot. .

Dedication 4 continues with

“Mercy.” This popular Kanye
West, G.0.0.D. Music collabora-
tion has been bumped at countless
pregames and parties.]ust like in
previous mixtapes (think No Ceil-
ings), Wayne had to give the hottest
track around a shot.

Enlisting the help of Nicki

Minaj who leads off atop the
slightly augmented “Mercy” beat,
Wayne makes good use of his-abil-
ity to rap over blaring bass. It’s
as if the artist gains some sort
of special power when a beat
rattles the rear—view mirrors or
the neighbors come banging on

the door asking residents to turn

down the music.

This was his chance to show
off, and he didn’t disappoint.
Queue the ’80s part of the track
and dim the lights. With his usual
swagger, Wayne makes us laugh,
grit our teeth and question his

‘ sanity all at the same time with

place to start. I 

one of the mixtape’s only impres-

‘sive performances.

The second of the two big-
name remixes is Lil Wayne’s
rendition of Meek Mill’s hymnal
“Amen.” It may be more upbeat
than the authoritative bump of
“Mercy,” but Wayne can’t seem
to muster up one more solid track
and fails to come close to the qual-
ity of the track’s original lyrics.
Preach.

It may not be cause to give Lil
Wayne back the title belt, but if
you’re looking for some beats that
will test your speaker system’s

bass and some whiney pump-up ‘

tracks, Dedication 4 isn’t a bad

Going to concerts can put quite
a dent in your wallet. Between
promoter fees, online charges,
shipping costs and paying the
band itself, tickets can end up
costing an arm, leg and whatever
other appendage is considered
disposable at the moment of
purchase. Many Pitt music lov-
ers can’t afford to see acts like
Modest Mouse, St’. Vincent and
David Byrne and Bruce Springs-
teen because ofthe high prices.

But we’re college students.
Loud music is a part of the rec-
ommended daily diet for our

_ growing minds andibodies. How

are we supposed to rock out
with our friends when it costs
a week’s pay to get in the door?

Luckily for us, Pittsburgh
hosts an active and diverse lo-
cal music scene that features
innumerable bandsand artists.
On any given night in the Steel

City, you can find a dive bar or ..

a basement that serves as an in-
expensive and accessible venue
for local and touring acts.
Between Hambone’s and
Belvedere’s in Lawrenceville,
Gooski’s in Polish Hill, Garﬁeld
Artworks in Garfield, The Shop
in Bloomfield, the Inn-Termis-
sion Lounge in South Side, 31st
Street Pub in the Strip and a fair
number of basements in Oak-

-land, cheap concerts are eas-

ily accessible for local students
who crave the feeling of having
hoarse voices and incessantly
ringing ears. Although many of
these venues are for listeners 21
or older, there are other chances
to catch these types of shows in
Pittsburgh if you don’t meet the
age requirement.

Local shows feature acts that
range across a variety of genres.
Whether it is punk, hardcore,
electronic, folk, jazz, math rock
or pop, Pittsburgh hasit cov-
ered. These shows offer music

“Lawless” draws
on various themes, from the juxtaposi-

Smaller venues and house parties make for more intimate shows with iocal artists. MCT campus

tion an intimate show can provide than
by attending a house show. A few weeks
ago, experimental punk act Fergus and
Geronimo, currently number 22 on WPTS’
music charts, played in a South Oakland

 

 

basement to a crowd of approximately .
30 people. The location of the show of-
fered the crowd a less conventional op—
portunity to interact with the band that
wouldn’t be possible at a typical Venue.

Imagine being in a room with a small
group of people, all mesmerized by the
droning sound ofa singer who may have
had one too many beers, a drummer who
can’t seem to keep his shirt on, spilled
drinks, cheap amps and padded concrete
walls. You can’t help but appreciate where
you are. When you see a band in a friend’s:»
basement, you feel a special connection
that can only be forged in that familiar
setting. In this case, the venue isjust as
important as the music that the bandis
playing.

Whether at a house show or at one of
the many small bars that host shows in
Pittsburgh, the concert—going experience
is often more enjoyable than what a mu-
sic lover experiences at a larger venue.
The concertgoer doesn’t have to worry
about being blinded by over—the-top laser
displays. No one stands in front ofyou‘
recording the feedback from speakers
with their iPhone. And you don’t have to
strain your neck from behind the guy with
his girlfriend on his shoulders. '

Smaller shows play host to like-mind-
ed people who alljust want to experience
the music for music’s sake. Instead of
having to purchase tickets months in

ment when an act passes around a “money
for bands”jar, trusting the crowd to pay
what they can.

The artists playing at these smaller,
more intimate shows may not be popu—'
lar enough to sell out the Consol Energy
Center or the Pete, .but the energy they
bring to these events more than com-

offer attendees the opportunity to jam

Although you may not be seeing The

‘l%fthere’s anything Pitt’s foot—.
ball team can take solace in after
last week’s shocking 31-17 loss
to Youngstown State University,
it’s that the Panthers can only
improve. ‘

With a shortened week because
of Thursday’s primetime matchup
against the University of Cincin-
nati (8 p.m. on ESPN), Pitt head
coach Paul Chryst and the rest of
the team have had little time to

rﬁpvell on last Saturday’s loss.

“Obviously, we’re disappoint-
ed in the outcome of the game.
My hat goes off to Youngstown
State. They are very well—coached.
They’re a good team,” Chryst said
in Saturday’s post-game press
conference. “Tonight they were
the better team. We’ve certainly
got to become a better football
team, and I think we can.”

But if the Panthers hope to
steal a victory from Cincinnati at

eiklippert Stadium, their defense —
particularly the defensive line and

linebackers — will have to show -

tremendousimprovement from
last weekend.

Pitt allowed 204 yards rush-
ing and 177 yards through the
air against Youngstown State, an
NCAA Division I Football Cham-
pionship Subdivision team —— a
classiﬁcation reserved for smaller
colleges. But more importantly,
the Panthers couldn’t prevent

‘Youngstown State from convert-
ing third downs. .

Pitt senior strong safety An-
drew Taglianetti said that the
team struggled with open-ﬁeld
tackling against Youngstown

§tate’s rhythm passing attack, and
it allowed the Penguins to convert
numerous third downs.

“I thought their offensive game
plan was pretty good. I mean, they
got the ball out of the quarter-
back’s hands pretty quickly, which

:hurt our defensive line,” Taglia-
netti said on Saturday. “It’s deﬁ-
nitely frustrating that you work
so hard on ﬁrst and second down,
and then third down comes up,
and they were converting them.”

.".='~. Unfortunately, Pitt plays a
team in Cincinnati-that thrives
on a spread offense predicated
on placing the ball in the hands of

Cincinnati quarterback
Munchie Legeaux returns this

season after passing for 749 yards .

and ﬁve touchdowns in limited
action lastfyear. Pitt cannot allow
Legeaux time to throw as the team
did last week with Youngstown
State quarterback Kurt Hess.

“You can always get your pad a

level down a little bit more. Some
of the things that are boring and
not exciting to hear about really
do make a difference, and those
are the things that we get to go
back and really hammer on and
reinforce,” Chryst said on Monday
in his weekly press conference.

But if there’s any positive
on-ﬁeld news from last week’s
matchup, it is the performance of
redshirt quarterback Tino Sunseri
and the return of senior running
back Ray Graham. »

Conﬁecticut last year, Graham led

- the NCAA in rushing with 958

yards. In his return last week,
Graham rushed for 71 yards on
14 carries and afterward said his
return was “great.”

“It felt great to get back out

i there, running around with a dif-

ferent opponent, actually live,”
Graham said. '
For Sunseri, last week’s game
against Youngstown State was
certainly an improvement after

he struggled mightily last season ,

in former Pitt head coach Todd
Graham’s offense. A

In an offense he clearly wasn’t
comfortable operating, Sunseri
passed for 2616 yards with 10
touchdowns and 11 intercep-
tions while.enduring 61 sacks. But
against Youngstown State, Sunseri
led the game in passing with 231
yards and a touchdown, and he
didn’t take a sack.

Sunseri downplayed the effort,
saying he could’ve done more for

have a chance against the Bearcats. Sheldon Satenstein | Staff

the team in the tough loss.

“You know, whenever you’re
not able to come in and win a foot-
ball game, there [are] obviously

some things you need to do bet- .

ter. I could have done morej’ the
senior passer. said.

Sunseri will need to improve
upon his perf'o'rman'ce from last
week for the matchup against the
Bearcats. But more importantly,
the offensive line will need a solid

effort this week after struggling F
to create space for Graham and -

Nate Barnes

Very‘ rarely do I ﬁnd myself at a
loss for words. But after Pitt lost
to Youngstown State on Saturday,
31-17, I found myself at more than
a loss for words.

Leaving Heinz Field after losing
a game against’ a Football-Cham-

-pionship Subdivision opponent,

a game in which Pitt never held

— a lead, I found myself infuriated.

Quite often I have left that stadium
frustrated, but Saturday marked
the ﬁrst time I left a sporting event
actually angry, and justiﬁablyso.

One can make a strong argument
that losing to YSU was the worst
loss in the history of Pitt’s football
program.

Yes, the 45-44 Cincinnati loss
in‘2oo9 that knocked the Panthers
out of Bowl Championship Subdivi-
sion contention was devastating.
But Cincinnati was a good team,
a Division I team. YSU is an entire
level below Pitt.

With that in mind, I now have
some questions. First and foremost,
who is to blame for this loss?

Must the players answer for this
drubbing? Or is it Paul Chryst? Is
it defensive coordinator Dave
Huxtable?

Perhaps it’s an even larger issue
that concerns the football program
itself and falls on the shoulders of
athletic director Steve Pederson?

All parties are guilty. The play-

ers certainly are for allowing
Youngstown State to come in‘ and
ﬂip the script by forcing Pitt to play
the role of cupcake and making the
Penguins look like the team with
a tradition of football excellence._

Pederson, with his recently
questionable track record in hir-
ing coaches, cannot be beneﬁcial
to the team either.- » . ‘

While as maligned as some make
Tino Sunseri out to be, one has to
realize that it is not easy learning a

Undefeated Panthers fight back to draw against St. Francis

Andrew Stern
For The Pitt News

In a game that featured a 20-yard strike
for a goal, a 100-minute delay for light-
ing and a red card, the Pitt men’s soccer
team (1-0-2) earned a 1-1 draw against
St. Francis (Pa.) last Saturday afternoon
in the Panthers’ home opener at the Pe-
tersen Sports Complex.

Pitt started the match attacking and
kept the Red Flash on their back heels,
junior captainjohn Cordier pointed out
post—game. The energy of the team’s de-
fense allowed the Panthers to further
their offensive mentality, one that has
played a crucial part in Pitt’s remaining
undefeated thus far in the season.

“Our back line was aggressive and
constantly pushed up,” the Panthers de-
fender said. “So I think that deﬁnitely
kept them on their heels early on.”

However, the Red Flash recovered
quickly from the early surge and scored
an impressive goal to take the lead.

St. Francis senior'Wayne Tiller entered ..
Pitt’s zone and delivered a perfect pass
to West Allegheny High School product
Nick Kolarac who then secured the ball
and ﬁred a shot from 20 yards out. The
shot just missed the outstretched hands

of goalie Leejohnston before hitting the
upper corner of the net.

Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher was
disappointed that his team fell behind
after dominating the game’s early stages.

“We had early chances and, really in
the first 20 minutes of the game, we were
all over them,” he said in a press release.

Unfortunately for the Panthers, the

Red Flash were able to put the sluggish

start behind them. They dominated the
rest of the half, enjoying a 1-0 lead at
halftime. ‘

Then the thunder and lightning came,
delaying the game for nearly two hours
before play could resume.

After the delay, the Panthers knew.

they had work to do.

“We knew we had to come out ﬂying
in the second half, and I really think we
did,” Cordier said.

Pitt was the aggressor during the first 1

two minutes of the second half. The ac-
tion culminated in what the Panthers
thought was the tying goal, but it was
disallowed by an offside call.

“After the second delay, we were able
to really force the issue, and we even
had a goal that was called offside, but
I think we set the tone well after half,”
Cordier said. '

The Panthers then suffered another

setback when freshman Nick Wysong
received a red card in the 54th minute.

Despite being down a man, the Pan-
thers had plenty of opportunities to tie
the game before finally succeeding when
junior Nico Wrobel pounced on a rebound
in the 72nd minute to level the contest.

Following the equalizer, St. Francis
had two key opportunities, butjohnston
would save both to preserve the 1-1 tie.

Luxbacher hailed his undefeated
team’s resiliency.

' “We played most of the second half
and two overtimes a man down, and our
guys showed a lot of grit, which they have
shown all year,” he said. “Our guys battled
back a man down for 65 minutes against
a team that had not given up a goal or lost
in eight games.” '

Johnston also had no trouble ﬁnding p _

positives from Saturday’s draw.

“I think we played really well as_a
whole unit,” the Pitt goalie said in a press
release, “andI hope a game like this can
give us momentum as we tackle the rest
of our season.”

The Panthers will host Indiana Uni-
versity-Purdue University Fort Wayne
on Friday at 7:30 p.m.- at the Ambrose

collegiate—level offense, let alone three in
three years. And although learning the X’s
aind O’s is closely tied to the quarterback posi-
tion, it applies across the board to all players
and positions.

Not only does the Youngstown State game
represent arguably the worst loss in program
history, it also hopefully indicates rock bot-
tom for quite possibly the most tumultuous
period in program history.

' What about Paul Chryst and his coaching
staff? Did they bring an unprepared team into
the ﬁrst game of Pitt’s season?

The Panthers certainly looked unpre-
pared, or at the very least disinterested, as

  

   

Youngstown State came out swinging and
never let up. The Penguins’ defensive front
seven dominated Pitt’s inexperienced offen-
sive line all game long, and as a result, the run
game couldn’t'establish any rhythm.

On the other side of the ball, Dave
Huxtable’s front seven found themselves
largely ineffective against the Youngstown
State offensive line, and it showed when the
Penguins rammed the football down the Pan-
ther defense’s collective throat.

Overall, the Penguins hung nearly 400
yardsof total offense on Pitt. That amount
of yardage allowed is unacceptable against
any team, let alone against a team of that
caliber. A team will lose most of its games
when it allows the opponent to execute its
offense ﬂawlessly, as Pitt allowed Youngstown
State to do.

18th Annual

Not only did the defense allow the ab—,
surd aforementioned yardage, it also forced
no turnovers and pressured the backﬁeld
very little. Not one Panther posted a sack,
and the team only registered two tackles for
loss. Pitt allowed its opposition to do just
about whatever it wanted with the football
en route to 23 ﬁrst downs, 31 points and only
one possession when Pitt actually made YSU
punt the ball away.

To sum it up, if the defense continues to
play at this level, Panther fans should not
expect Pitt to win a single game this season.
Given how Pitt played Saturday, not even
Gardner—Webb — also an FCS opponent — is
a sure thing. '

But the poomess of the defense’s perfor-
mance, thankﬁilly, was proportionate to the
offense’s success, so at least Pitt fans have

something to look forward to. Tino Sunseri
was arguably the best player in a blue and gold
uniform Saturday, passing for 239 yards on
19-30 attempts, with one touchdown. If not
for freshman tight end].P. Holtz falling down
after a completion with no one between him
and the end zone, Tino easily would have had
another scoring toss in the books.

Although Ray Graham only rushed for
71 yards on 14 carries, Isaac Bennett helped
lighten his load by carrying 10 times for 42
yards and a score when he punched the ball
in from four yards out in the ﬁrst quarter to
tie the contest at 7-7. — _

Returning to Graham, though, his fumble
in the red zone on the Panthers’ ﬁrst drive
of the game resulted in Youngstown State
driving 79 yards down the ﬁeld for a score
and arguably a 14-point swing in the game’s
proceedings. .

The Panthers turned the ball over again
in the fourth quarter when, after a comple-
tion from Sunseri to wide receiver Devin
Street, Street fumbled on the Youngstown
State 22-yard line and sealed the Panthers’
fate. Although the secondfumble came when
the game was possibly out of reach for Pitt,
turnovers in and around the red zone are
unacceptable. 0

That stat line, along with the zero turn-
overs forced by the Pitt defense, may very
well have made the difference in the game.

With the offense looking as good as it did, I
am brought to another question. What should
Panther fans take away from this game aside
from the anger, disappointment and various
negatives? '

First, remember this game really does not
matter. I think we can realize there are slim
BCS title hopes for the Panthers this year,
and there was no way they would go 12-0 in
the ﬁrst place. _

Besides, only one game against an FCS op-
ponent counts toward a team’s necessary six
wins for a bowl bid, so if Pitt beats Gardner-
Webb, the Panthers will have their one win.

The best shot at any postseasonplay for
the Panthers is through the Big East, and
Saturday’s contest holds no bearing upon the
Big East standings. If Pitt manages to win just
four out of seven Big East games this season,

the Panthers will be in the thick of the hunt .

for a conference championship that would
result in a1BCS bowl bid.

But with all that being said 

I still want answers. I
