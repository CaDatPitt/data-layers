By Iiw ROTHMAN

Joe Clark, Pennsylvania

fi‘1Dem_,ocratic Candidate for the

United States Senate, stated

 Thursday that P r e sid e n t

Eisenhower’s particular “gen-
ius is friendship, not leader-
ship. In a partisan speech before
approximately 125 students, the
Philadelphian referred to the Re.-
 P Tblican party as a party of “sta-

m,,%.'ility and drift” in contrast to the

Democrat party of
amidst restlessness.

The former Philadelphia mayor

the Young Democrats of Pitts-

to questions on Democratic policy
and personalities. ,
“New America” Supported
Clark who is solidly‘ behindthe
Stevenson concept of a “New
America” spoke up for govern-
ment concern of localized pover-
ty-harrassed communities. He de-

_,Igxnded public housing, defending

the ‘governments right to assure
suitable living facilities, as against
Republican" willingness to “let
situations work out by them-
selves.” ' -
He contrasted the Democratic
“New America” of concern for
grass roots citizens with Re-
publican big business. ”
Challenged Clark, “Are we go-

woetry Slighted Here

(Editor’s Note: This is a column written by A. Hartley Saxon. a
, freshman student in Medical School who during his undergraduate

days was highly‘ interested in the

English Department.)

For some time now I have been constantly aware that
the University of Pittsburgh’s writing course is one of the
best the country has to offer. This I have been told by
those who point proudly to the prizes won by Pitt students
for their short stories in the Atlanic Monthly Contest, by
those who boast that Manuscripts is read by publishers who

read no other student magazine;

and by those who like to talk of
“Pitt's own Gladys Schmitt.” All
of these are valid, I agree, but the
fact that they all point to ac-
complishments in prose writing,
and the short story in particular,
illustrates the lopsidedness of the
entire writing program at Pitt.
The poet, it seems, has been for-
gotten.
Verse Ignored

That verse should be so com-
pletely ignored at the University
of Pittsburgh is surprising when
one considers the poetic potential
of the school. First of all there
are the literature courses, stress-
ing to a great extent, verse. Now
it seems only natural that a stu-
dent of English who is constantly
in contact with verse might event-
ually wish to compose some of his
own. And this, as evinced by a list
collected last year of those who

 ould be interested in a verse

writing course, is precisely the
case.

Yet there is no course avail-
able for this purpose, even
though there are two courses
in writing the short story and
one in writing the essay for
those who might wish to try
their hand at prose. A second
course of this poetic potential, ,
though admittedly a more du-
bious one, is the ability of sev-
eral teachers in the school to
conduct a verse writing class.
Strangely e n o u g h, however,
these teachers are reluctant to
do this; and so long as they
remain reluctant, all efforts
toward establishing a verse
writing course, as with the list
of names, will go unrewarded.
But since the English Depart-
ment does not at present seem in-
clined to offer a course in writing»
verse, what in the meantime are
the chances of the potential poet
at Pitt becoming a good poet?
Rather poor, for not only must

also advocated a program which will station Jewish-American

ity of the Democratic party as
the reason for Congress under
Democratic majority in recent
years being unable to pass Taft-
Hartley amendments.

He placed blame for the fault
on both Southern Democrats
who have not yet conﬁrmed
faith in labor unions and the
Executive branch which has
failed to press for such legisla-
vtion.

Said'Clark in effect, the un-
workable meager majority of De-
mocrats in Congress has been off-
set by reluctant Southerners.
Taft-Hartley revision advocates

essary pressures from the execu-
tive branch have not been applied

The candidate maintained his
position that the Democratic Par-
ty is the only national party de-
spite previous arguments and
challenged the audience to show
that the Republican party repre-
sented the nation.

Clark. calm and affable,
struck against what he termed
unrealistic foreign policy of the
present administration.

He said “Colonialism is dead,"
but the executive doesn’t recog-
nize it.

He blasted Dulles’ “Brink of
War” statements. And ‘he compar-
ed the Republican right wing of
Jenner, Nixon, and McCarthy in
foreign affairs with the difficulty
Southern Democrats pose for their
party in Domestic affairs.

Clark who will oppose incum-
bent Senator Duff in November
came out in strong support of de-
fensive arms for the State of Is-
rael. He claimed that refusal to
send such machinery as anti-air-
craft guns was impoverishing the
country’s defenses, and also urged
that the government defend the

YM -YW ‘ll/[Tap   Series
Of Informal Chats

By ED BACHMAN ‘
While American colleges boast good relations between,
faculty and students, the University of Pittsburgh’s YMCA
and YWCA groups are setting out to prove that theory.
This will be attempted through an expanded faculty-student

discussion plan.

 
  

 

Headed by Bill Kelly,'Co1. ’59, this plan figures to bring .

groups of undergraduate studentse

to meetings at various faculty‘
members‘ houses. At these meet-ls
ings, topics will be discussed
ranging from religion, to student
problems, to personal hobbies of
the professors.
Widen Scope

The plan was initiated at Pitt
some years ago, but Kelly plans
to widen the ‘scope considerably
this year. One of the major ob-
jectives is to make the discussions
a year—ai-ound project, instead of
the previous “one-shot’ ’af‘fairs.

Basically, the student—faculty
relations plan will work like
this:

Professors living in various
areas throughout the Pittsburgh
district will volunteer their time
and the use of their houses.
Groups of students living in the
respective area will then meet
at the faculty member’s house
informally, approximately once
a month.

Under this atmosphere; the pro-
gram is hoped to meet a two-fold
purpose. The first is to fulﬁll the
need for a closer personal rela-
tionship between the student and
his professor. And the second pur-
pose is to maintain this relation-
ship throughout the, year with
continued discussions on common
interest subjects. a I

Professors Agreed

Two professors have already
agreed to take part in the pro-
gram duringthe school year 1956-
57. They are: Dr. Arthur Kann-
wischer, Professor of Philosophy
and a member of the YMCA Com-
mittee of Management; and Dr.
Robert E. Carlson, Associate Pro-
fessor of History. Other faculty
names are due to be released by
Kelly soon.

Incidentally, long-range par-

ticipation of this program is seen
upon the opening of the stu-
-dent dormitories in the Pitt-
owned Schenley Park Apart-

Dr. Kannwischer

ments, when faculty members
will live nearby the student
quarters. A good groundwork
in this year's program should
aid close relationships‘ when the
dorms open. '

The discussion program will
start this year as soon as possible.
It is open to all undergraduates.
Those interested are requested to
leave their names and addresses
in the YMCA, or YWCA office, ‘lo-
cated on the eighth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral of Learning. When a—
sufficient list is compiled, sched-
ules will be worked out for the
convenience of both participating
students and faculty members.

Judiciary Commission Begins
Enforcement of IF Regulations

Interfraternity Counci1’s Judiciary Commission oiﬁcially
begins its ﬁrst year of operations this year. I

The Commission was formed by IF at the end of last
year to permit fraternity men to “trycases involving fra-
ternities or fraternity members for violations of IF rulings.”
It willalso enforce University regulations since one of the

against the University properties
and policies.

Membership of the Commission
consists of two seniors, a junior,
and a sophomore. The vice-presi-
dent of IF serves as chairman of
the Commission. This year the
commissioners are led by Bob
Lancaster, Bus. Ad. ’57. The jus-
tices are Bob McCabe, Col. '57;
Sam Rich, Col. ’57; Hal Kelley,
Bus. Ad. ’58, and Chuck Wittlin,
Bus. Ad. ’59. They were elected
in a general election by Pitt fra-
ternity members.

Theodore W. Biddle, speaking
for the Dean of Men’s office, said,
“We look upon‘the formation of
the Commission as a step forward
in self-government and self-ad-
ministration. Fraternity men will
be able to deal with fraternity
judicial matters better than we
can.”

When the Commission was ap-
proved by IF last year, Lancaster,
who was on the committee that
drafted the plans for the Commis-
sion, said that he thought it would

“eventually rank with the ‘S’

IF rules prohibits any infraction:

Award as one of the great IF
projects.” _

The new Commission will hear
complaints of IF rule viola-«
tions by individuals or frater-
nities, and will review evidence
from testimony and investiga-
tion. The Commission will then
recommend penalties which will
be enforced by the oﬂice of the
Dean of Men. If the Commis- ‘
sion “deems it necessary” it can
also prepare a case for the con-
sideration of the Council of Fra-
ternity presidents.

This latter group, which is com-
posed of the presidents of each
fraternity, will sit as an appelate
court in the new judicial system

Previously all fraternity dis-
cipline cases were handled by

‘the Men’s Fraternity Committee,
which is composed of nine fac-
ulty members headed by Don-
ald Militery, assistant to the
dean of men and fraternity ad- I
visor. This committee is ap-

pointed by the chancellor and
will remain in the judicial sys-

Business Staff Names
Smith Finance Adviser

John Selmer Smith, retired vice-president of Mellon Na-
tional Bank and Trust Co. began a new career Sept. 1, when
he joined the Pitt business staff as ﬁnancial counsellor.

In this position, Smith will advise the business staff of
the University and the ﬁnance committee of the board of
trustees, and act as liaison officer with banking and other

banking relations. 6

Dr. Edward Litchfield, chancel-
lor of the University, said in an-
nouncing the appointment, “We
are extremely fortunate to have
Mr. Smith join our staff. As the
University undertakes a program
of rapid development during the
coming years, his experience and
maturity of judgment will pro-
vide./ra valuable asset as we en-
dreavor to bring our resources up
to the needs of our plans.

Smith is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Tennessee and Colum-
bia University. He served as a
lieutenant in the United States
Navy during World War I and

was associated with the New York _

Trust Company in New York City
before coming to Pittsburgh in
1929 as assistant vice-president of
the Farmers Deposit National
Bank. He subsequently became
vice-president, and in 1944 was
elected president of that bank. He
held this position until 1950, when
the bank became the Farmers
Bank Office of Mellon National
Bank and Trust Company.

Berkley Contestant
Gets Second Place ,
In Grid Festival

“By DONNA CONSIDINE

“More than riding around in a
white thunderbird and silver and
blue eldorado, and getting orchids
twice a day, what really made the
trip great were the fourteen other
girls who were there.”

So said Gloria Kohl, Pitt’s entry
as queen to the University of
California’s 1956 Football Festival,
sponsored by the Berkley Junior
of Commerce, September 18 to 22.

Gloria was runner-up in the
queen contest, making this the
second year in a row that Pitts-
burgh’s representative has placed
so high. Collette Mullen, Ed. ’55,
won the second spot in the 1955
festival.

Upon arrival by Trans-World
Airlines ﬂight at_Los Angeles In-
ternational Airport September 16,
the~girls were driven to an in-
formal luncheon, after posing in
bathing suits for photoglaphers
from the Los Angeles Chronicle.

They were given a tour of Dis-
neyland, where “we sampled all
the rides,” and were personal
guests of Walt Disney at the
Plantation House in the amuse-
ment park.

The next day they were made
up for a show, “Today in the
West,” at NBC studios, after
which each contestant was inter-
viewed about outstanding men in
her community. Dr. Jonas Salk
was the local personality who in-
terested the press most. '

OLD GOLD’S GREAT NEW GAME

A total of 24 puzzles will appear before the Christmas
holiday. Get startednow in Old Gold’s exciting new
game for college students only.

Here are the Official Tangle Schools
Rules! SAVE THEM!

I. PRIZES (is) P. Lorillard Company, the makers of
OLD GOLD CIGARETTES, will award a total of 86
prizes, valued at more than $l5,000—-to college students
in the United States in accordance with the following
Official Rules. (See complete list of prizes.) (6) This
game will consist of twenty-four (24) monogrammed
puzzle drawings to be published in this and other
college newspapers: three puzzles each week for eight
weeks, and a. series of tie-breaking puzzles, if needed,
as outlined in rule 2. (e) Contestants must arrange the
scrambled letters from each of the 24 monogrammed
drawings so that they correctly spell the name of a
certain American college or university. In the scrambled
drawings there are no superfluous letters, no distortion
of letters, and no letters are leit out to confuse or into-
lead entrants. A clue will be furnished with each draw-
ing to help identify the correct answer to the puzzle.

2. (c) The person complying with all the rules of the
game and solving the highest number of puzzles
correctly will be declared the winner of the ﬁrst prize,
a 40-day tour of the world for two pei-sons—the winner
and another person of his choosing or, at the option of
the winner, the first prize shall consist of $5,000 to be
paid to the winner. The person complying with all the
rules of the game and solving the second highest number
of puzzles correctly will be declared the winner 01 the
second prize. In like manner, the winners of the remain-
lng 84 prizes will be determined. (Is) In case more than
one person solves correctly the same number of puzzles,
the prize tied for, and as many subsequent prizes as
there are persons tied, will be reserved and those so tying
will be required to solve a set of tie-breaking puzzles, to
determine the order in which the reserved prizes will be
awarded. Each of the tie-breaking puzzles will be com-
prised of scrambled letters forming the names of either
one, two or three American colleges or universities. Clues
with each puzzle drawing will indicate whether the
puzzle contains one, two or three schools to be iden-
tified. If, after solutions have been submitted to this
second set 01 puzzles, a tie or ties still remain, those tied
will be required to solve another tie-breaking puzzle. Ac-'
companying this tie-breaker will be an oﬂiclnl list of
American colleges and universities. From these, content-
Intn will make up a list of schools and colleges in accord-
Inca with instructions to be given at that time. The
contestant earning the highest score in so doing will be
awarded the highest of the prizes tied for. The next
highest prize will be awarded the contestant earning the
second highest score and so on down through the re-
served prizes that have been tied for. These tie-breaking
puzzles, if necessary, will be mailed to each contestant.

P. Lorillard Company reserves the right (only in the

' event of further tie or ties) to require contestants to

solve as many tie-breaking puzzles under supervision,
and without assistance, as are necessary to determine
a single winner for each prize.

sent in separately. Save the puzzles and your solution:
so that they may be submitted as a complete set at the
end of the game. Entrants are not limited as to the num-
ber of complete sets of Solutions. However, each set must
be submitted individually, and only one prize will be
awarded to any one entrant. (c) After the deadline {or

Union Use

The opening of,Pitt’s Student Union last Monday marked I

a signiﬁcant milestone in the University’s expansion pro-
gram. The Hunt and Pine Rooms—the first of many——are
offering added facilities for light eating, socializing, and
education in an informal sense. ln time will follow a mod-
ern cafeteria, ballroom, and lounging rooms, but at present,
it is the Hunt Room and the Pine Room that deserves the
attention of the students.

It would be unfortunate indeed if few students took
advantage of the new facilities. The Union represents a
goal that has been planned for years. At least it is partly
here. The only thing needed now is student participation
and enthusiasm.

It has been observed that the new Union Rooms were
not as crowded this past week as should be_ the case.
Whether it has just been the general confusion and lack of
time that goes along with buying books and getting settled
in classes is hard to say at this point. It must be noted,
however, that the main part of the unenthusiastic attend-
ance has been in the Pine Room. It seems that most stu-
dents do not realize that the Pine Room offers the same
facilities as the larger Room. Infact, it has often been re-
ferred to as an extension of the Hunt Room. I

It can only be a matter of time before thesituation will
be decided one way or the other. We hope it’s in favor of
the students.

What's a Room? . . .

The Hunt Hallmark i '

By Irv Rothmon

What can a room mean?

To some people it is home; to others, a recrea-
tion area; many use it for studying, others for eat-
ing and sleeping. It is often a neat, compact liv-
ing area with a torchier and suspension lamp, a

'mohair couch and a leather back easy chair,

and, of course, a television set. It is often rec-
tangular with sweeping ‘gold-
black sectional furniture, futur-
istic lamps and a large picture
window contrasting the wide
brick ﬁreplace ornamented with A
brass. ‘

It may house a potbelly stove
‘and old gas refrigerator placed
around a porcelain top table
with _white wooden legs or a
Hollywood bed complemented by  D. .
fruitwood mahogany bedroom furniture far too
modern for grandma who prefers her walnut poster
bed and high glass dressing table:

Commons Chambers

Or a room may be grand and impressive as the
House of Commons chambers or a replica for classes
such as the English room.

It may contain the congested, brown-nicked
tables in the Blue Tuck Shop . . or it may in-
clude a wide bar reminiscent of the wild twenties
with the marvelous round mirror dominating the
wall behind the utilitarian cash register. And it
may include a faded hunting mural around the
walls to provide atmosphere for the people within
the room who may be joking or eating or chatting
or chattering or snoozing.

A room may mean many things to many people.
Yet when a room can stimulate excitement rather
than memories, when it can open yes instead of
watching them close, when it can initiate a new
environment and a new concept of life for not few
people it serves a purpose that deserve to be re-

A room may contain both memories and hopes.
And such a room is the Hunt Room in the student
union building.

It offers reminiscences of more elegant days al-
though now it is not lush; it is not modern. It is
not unusually attractive although there are sec-
tions of it which are impressive. Yet it is the hall-
mark in this University’s “new concept” of student
life.

As such this room connotes many ideas of revo-
lutionized curricular and extra-curricular concepts
now being processed, shortly to be effected. For
this reason it satisfies many desires.

It means pleasant eating facilities that will soon
be expanded to include a large cafeteria and modern
private dining facilities meeting quarters where

ably; it means weekly dances for the student bod 

students can discuss their programming comfort
convenient office space for clubs and organization '

as well as conference rooms for easy rapport
among committee workers; it means localization
of religious activity and more practical facilities for
vocational guidance and employment.

Strengthened Government

It means strong student government with the
heavy responsibility of student management and
budgeting and intelligent application of business
and government management with adequate cham-
bers for operation.

It means library space for studying, for brows-

sion rooms for informal tete—a—tete.

It means uniﬁcation of men’s and women’s ac-
tivities in extra-curricular and domestic affairs
under an administration in which the students take
the initiative. It will be theirs to decide that which
they want and that which they wish to discard for
being obsolete.

But more important than all else the Hunt
Room signiﬁes the beginning of a campus life which
embodies'concepts of vigorous scholastic and social

ing; listening rooms for music recordings; discux

 

corded in proper historical perspective.

Same Old Song . . .

Student Discount Blues

By Gordon Clowney

A story which appeared in last
Wednesday’s Pitt News told stu-
dents of the opportunity to par-
ticipate in an expanded student
discount program. Nineteen mer-
chants in the
D o w n t o w n,
O a kl a n d

and East Lib
erty areas wer
listed as parti
cipants in th ‘_
p r o g r a m t 0 ‘
save 10% o_
purchases mad
at their stores

For the bene-
ﬁt of those stu- _
dents who weren’t around last
year, perhaps it would be best
to recapitulate the activities of
the Student Discount Service
over the past two years. SDS
was begun as a student congress
project, under a special commit-
tee headed by A1 Boll, a June ’56
graduate, in the spring of 1955.
The program offered a 10 per-
cent discount, as does this year’s
program, on all merchandise
purchased at any of twenty par-
ticipating stores.

The plan included not only
Pitt students, but also those of
the other four city colleges, Car-
negie Tech, Duquesne, Mt.
Mercy, and Chatham (at that
time known as P.C.W.). At the
end of the spring semester a poll
of participating merchants was
conducted to test the effective-
ness of the program to date. The
results of this poll, though in-
conclusive, did indicate indiff-
erence on the part of a majority
of the student body. The man-
agers of discount stores seemed
to blame the SDS committee for
failure ‘to publicize the program
effectively.

When last fall rolled around,
David Washington, Col. ’57, was
appointed chairman and SDS
picked up where it had left of!

the preceeding semester. How-

ever, not much enthusiasm was
generated by either I the SDS
committee or the student body.
In fact, at times it was hard to
tell .which_faction exhibited the
gmost apathy toward a_program
which only -the...i.s¢m%9t.e..r;,;.»loetsre

 

   
 
  
   

education.

had been planned and instituted
with such enthusiasm.

Poll Taken

Another polling of merchants,
taken last October, showed these
individuals to be very much in
favor of the program, but Pitt
students still were maintaining
an “I don’t care” attitude. The
majority of store owners con-
tacted seemed to suspect that
students were unaware of a dis-
count service being available to
them. “Any number of students
will come in and purchase mer-
chandise, but they don’t ask for
a discount. When you question
them about it, they don’t seem.
to know anything about it,” said
the owner of an Oakland hab-
erdashery shop.

0 t h e r merchants indicated
that some students were present-
ing discount cards from the pre-
ceeding semester, which were no
longer valid. And so it went,
owner after owner, all pointing
out that Pitt students were just
not taking advantages of the cut
rate prices offered them.

The SDS committee, however,
didn’t do much to improve mat-

ters. True, they gave information ‘

to Pitt. News reporters when
contacted by them. Also, a few
signs prompting students to pick
up discount cards at the student
desk were posted on some of
the bulletin boards about school.
Nevertheless, signs aren’t the
most startling way of calling at-
tention to, or explaining a pro-
ject, and aside from this, the

SDS committee seemed content,

to let the News handle the‘
publicity on the discount serv-
ice. There were even mistakes
on the list of participating stores.
Three stores were listed which
were no longer cooperating in
the program.

Results Same

Still another poll was taken
in November, after SDS had
been in operation for six months.
The resultsthis time were much
the same as those of the two
previous polls.

This time, one store polled re- :

ported" that they had moved to a

A. new address . two ..months: before
last _ year’s lists _were- distributed, - :
.»,,but the old «address. wasiigiven

   

 

on the card. A Squirrel Hill.
store was listed as a participant,
but the poll showed that the
Oakland branch of the same
store was offering the discount,
while the other store had never
been a member of the service.
Many of the stores indicated
they would not, renew their
agreement if better response by
students did not become evident
before the expiration date.

Later in the year, Washington
resigned his job as SDS chair-
man, and Al Berman, Col. ’58,
was appointed in his place. After
this, SDS was hardly publicized
at all- for the remainder of the
school year.

Select Chairman ‘

In May, S.C. appointments
committee met to select a new
discount chairman for this school
year. Stanley Franzos, Bus. Ad.
’59, was the man appointed.
Franzos has evidently been
pretty busy over the summer,
liningup nineteen stores, only
nine of which were among the
original members in‘~l955.‘

It was a wonderful idea to dis-
tribute the discount cards at re-
gistration this year, however,
the list of stores was not avail-
able to students, and no litera-
ture of any kind was distributed
for the beneﬁt of new students. )
Anyone not knowing what SDS
was from preceeding years,
would certainly -have been justi-
ﬁed in tossing away the little
white cards given them. '

Finally, when the News sent
a reporter to look into the situ-
ation, the list of stores giving
discounts this year was made
available and published in Wed-
nesday’s paper. When asked
what other steps had been taken,
Franzos said signs would: be put
up later. .

Whether it’s the fault of the
students, for lack of interest; the
committees, for lack of publi-
city, or, and this is probably the.
best answer, the fault of both,
some positive interested action
must be taken this year, or_ the
present merchants will not be,

._members will .be unwilling to.

Says Europe ls
Little Child And '

Serious Student
(Editorﬁs Note: This is the
fourth of a series on student
trips to Europe.)
By BARBARA CHERINGTON
f‘Europe is not only a monu-
.ment to history; Europe is the
little child and the serious
student who studies ten or

"twelve hours a day,” said Sue
Roche, 1955 Vira Heinz Scholar-
ship awardee.

’ In Paris, where she spent most
of her stay this summer, Sue at-
tended classes in practical French
at the Alliance Francaise. Stu-
dents throughout Europe, she ob-
served, had more appreciation of
and interest in what they studied
than where.

Joyeuse, Ardeche, France, a
town of 500 population, was where
-Sue stayed with relatives. In this
village the houses were 200 year-
old stone buildings.‘There was “no
heat, but merely, wooden stoves.
Women washed clothes in creeks
or country lakes.”

Market day, each Tuesday, took
place in the streets where mer-
chants set up tents.

Such strict parental control over
youth existed, Sue said, that a

to bring his date home by eleven

“The people of Holland were

of language barriers,” However,
Sue was surprised -to discover~a
new type of transportation on a

date. When her gentleman friend

Gloria Cops Second

series, chats with Gloria Ann Kohl, Pitt's candidate for the title

of “l956 Football Festival Queen.”

Miss Kohl visited the Bur-

bank lot with 14 other coeds from colleges around the country
who are competing for the “Festival Queen.”

(Continued from Page 2)
“We then had luncheon at the
Sports Club where I was pounced
upon by about 50 sports writers
who wanted to know what kind
of team Pitt has,” Gloria said.
Warner Brothers and Para-
mount studios were the next stops
for the campus queens. Complete
‘tours of the lots were sponsored
by the publicity departments of
both studios. After watching the
ﬁlming of “Delicate Delinquent,”
starring Jerry Lewis, the girls had
pictures taken with him, Susan
Hayward, and Martha Hayden.

During dinner at the Brown

‘ Derby “I chose the most expen-
sive thing on the menu because it
was written in French. I didn’t
know! what it was, but it sounded
delicious,” Pitt’s'queen commented.

"The maitre -d’hotel greet.ed‘*all~
the -stars who came‘ in and fin-I

atrocluced them «to us: some of

 

Donnell, (Gobel’s wife in the tele-
vision series, and Debbie Reyn-
olds.”

When the candidates arriv-
ed at the Berkley airport, Tues-
day, Sept. 18, they were met by
an alumnus of their own schools.
A motor caravan conducted them
to Oakland and Berkley.

“It was then that I received the
white thunderbird for my own
use all week. It had my name
printed on the side in gold let-
-ters,” she added.

Luncheon at the Kiwanis Club
featured meeting the Mayor of
Berkley and Governor of Cali-
fornia, Goodwin Knight, and the
University of California football
team.

was expected to hop on the back
of a bicycle.

“In Germany, it was possible to
see men building day and night
using hugh floodlights. New
apartment buildings’ and homes
were planted everywhree and
ruins’ were cleared away,” the
awardee observed.

Concerning politics in Europe,
Sue said that the people feel
that America is building a sec-
ond empire, not by land-grab-
bing but through economic en-
croachment. “Governments in
Europe seem to feel their power
to bargain fading away because

of distinct economic obliga-
tions.” A
One student in Europe was

quoted by Sue as saying, “Your
second economic empire in the
United States is exceedingly
powerful.” In its battle to make
Europe a powerful trading center
to withstand Communism, the
United States has created pres-
sure in the European countries,
the student believed.

“Meals in Europe were quite

- “long and drawn out,” Sue ob-

served. Courses of a Supper
were delayed to four hours or
more. Delay of courses occurred
so that conversations could be
lengthy. ‘Sue found table-talk
more like dissertations than po-
lite light chatter.

‘While in London, she visited
Oxford, Winsor, and Hampton
Court Palace. In Belgium, she saw
Brussels and Lauvain. Heidelberg
Caste, city of Worms and Oppen-
heim were part of her tour, also.

Another motorcade conducted
the collegians to a garden party
at the Kiser estate where they
splashed around “in a kidney

‘ shaped swimming pol filled with

orchids, gardenias, and Hawaiian
flowers.”

A tour of San Francisco includ-
ed a cable car ride and two hours
for dinner in a Chinese restaurant
“where everyone tried to eat with
chopsticks.”

Gloria thinks that it is an odd
coincidence that her escort for the

' Coronation Ball had red hair, al-

most the same color as her own.
At the dance each entrant was in-
terviewed on stage and had to
stand until all 15 interviews were
completed.

‘‘All I kept thinking was, ‘my
feet are killing me!’ ” Miss Foot-
ball of "1956, Donna Casson of
Oklahoma was then presented by
the Governor with Gloria and the
Baylor entry, ‘the runners—up.

“Friday evening was the great-
est thrill of my life. We had the
float parade on the main street

FOOTBALL: ITS CAUSE AND CURE

At next Saturday’s football game, while you are sitting

in your choice student’s seat on the ten-yard line, won’t —

you give a thought to Alaric Sigafoos?

Who, you ask, is Alaric Sigafoos? Come closer, sit
down, light a Philip Morris, savor that natural tobacco
goodness, sigh contentedly, cross your fat little legs, and
listen. '

Alaric Sigafoos (1868-1934) started life humbly on a
farm near Thud. Kansas. His mother and father, both

named Ralph, were bean-gleaners, and Alaric became a

bean-gleaner too. But he soon tired of the work and went
to Memphis where he got a job with a logging ﬁrm. Here
the ex-bean-gleaner worked as -a stump—thumper. Then
he drifted to Texas where he tidied up oil ﬁelds (pipe-
wiper). Then to Arizona where he strung dried fruit
(ﬁg-rigger). Then to Virginia where he was a research
assistant (book-locker). Then to Long Island where he.‘
dressed poultry (duck-plucker) . Then to California where
he lectured young women who were about to get married
(bride-chider). Then to Minnesota where he cut up frozen
lakes (ice-slicer).. Then to Nevada where he determined
the odds in a gambling house (dice-pricer). Then to
Milwaukee where he pasted camera lenses together
(Zeiss-splicer) .

Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a
tannery, beating pig-hides until they were soft and supple
(hog-ﬂogger). Here he found happiness at last.

  

(-1:

1 I O /AS9720" /Z5’/0,bZ‘[7f55 3; /<7df« °

\Vhy, you ask, did her ﬁnd happiness at last as a hog-
ﬂogger? Light another ﬁrm and fragrant Philip Morris,
taste that true tobacco ﬂavor, puff, relax, let sweet lassi-
tude possess your limbs, and listen. ’

Next door to the hog—ﬂoggery was an almond grove

_owned by a girl named Chimera Emrick. Chimera was

pink and white and marvelously hinged, and Alaric was
hopelessly in love the moment he clapped eyes on'her.
Each day he came to the almond grove to woo Chimera,
but to no avail. He tried with all his vigor and guile,
but she, alas, stayed cool.

Then one day Alaric got a brilliant idea. It was the
da.y before the annual Omaha Almond Festival. On this
day, as we all know, every almond grower in Omaha
enters a ﬂoat in the big parade. The ﬂoats always consist
of large cardboard almonds hanging from large cardboard
almond trees.

Alaric’s inspiration was to stitch pieces of pigskin
together and inﬂate them until they looked like big,
plump almonds. “These sure beat skinny old cardboard
almonds,” said Alaric to himself. “Tomorrow they will
surely take ﬁrst prize for Chimera, and she will be mine!”

Early the next’ morning Alaric came running to
Chimera with his inﬂated pigskin almonds, but she, alas,
told him she was not entering a ﬂoat that year. In fact,
she had just sold her almond grove and was moving East

to try out with the Boston Red Sox.

Alaric, upon hearing these glum tidings, ﬂew into a
violent rage. He started kicking his pigskin almonds all
over the place. And who should be walking by at that
very instant but Abner Doubleday!

-Mr. Doubleday. who had invented baseball some years
earlier, was now trying to invent football, but without
success. The trouble was, he couldn't ﬁgure out what kind
of ball to use. Now, seeing Alaric kick the pigskin
spheroids, his problem was suddenly solved. “Eureka!”
he cried, and ran to his drawing board, and the rest is
history!

“The longer the team repre-

Highlight 1957 Grid Schedule

If most of the Panther partisans are complaining because
they think the 1956 Blue and Gold schedule is too tough,

they better run to the closet

and grab the handiest crying

towel when they glance at the 1957 card.

Soccer Skipper Bemis

Stresses Conditioning

By ARNOLD JACOBSON
Coach Leo Bemis begins his third season at the helm of
the Blue and Gold booters primarily concerned with the
conditioning of his players as they prepare for a tough card.
The tension of the tough schedule is expected to be

eased somewhat, however, by the? .

good— reserve material and the
presence of two outstanding re-
turnees, Jerry Bressanelli and
Mike Culhane, who are both All-
American materials according to
most observers.

Last Saturday an intra—squad
scrimmage took place for the pur-
pose of ﬁnding out just how good
the team is and who can do what.

Cheshelski Tops Goalies

Emerging from the skirmish as
the probable starting goalie for
the opener with Slippery Rock,
Oct. 6, is Ben Cheshelski of Lin-
den, New Jersey.

High-scoring Bressanelli has
cinched a starting berth at the
inside left position and will un-
doubtedly remain a ﬁxture at
that position because of his
scoring potential.

The other big name in the
Bemisrnen’-s lineup will be the

towering Culhane (6-4) from Ire-'

land. Culhane is regarded as one
of the best players in the nation
and will ﬁll the center fullback
spot which is one of the defensive
positions that “reﬂects the strength
of a team.
Conditioning Emphasized

The starting line will be com- ,

prised of Al Solomon at inside
right, Sammy Hazou at outside
left, Joe Kane at outside right,
and Frank Reginella at center for-
Ward.

In the backﬁeld will be Jack
Hester at left halfback, Jacques
Hill at right halfback, Paul
Griffiths at left fullback and
either Bob Sadowsky or Bill
Eisinger at the right fullback
posts.

“A lot will be determined this
week,” says Bemis, Then he add-
ed, “It’s all a matter of condition-
ing.”

Frosh Impressive

Coach Bemis didn’t take notice
only of the varsity last week,
but kept watchful eyes on the
future Blue and Gold varsity team

which showed impressively
week although they bowed,
to the regulars.
‘The team will continue
strenuous drills

its
so that they
will be prepared for the opener

with Slippery Rock and the
battle with Navy later in the
season.

Last season when the Midship-
men bounced the Jungle Cats
Bemis felt it was due to poor
conditioning on behalf of some of
the players. The Panther coach
hopes to avoid that situation this
year as he says, “Conditioning is
the common denominatior of soc-
cer."

° The high spot of the murderous
slate will be the appearance of the
powerful Oklahoma S o o n e r s
coached by Bud Wilkinson. It will
be the first visit to the Stadium
for the Oklahoma since they ‘ap-
peared here in 1953. Incidentally,
the underdog Jungle Cats held
them toa 7-7 deadlock in that
clash.

Other home tilts besides Okla-
homa are Nebraska, Syracuse,
West Virginia, and Penn State.

The Army and Notre Dame
clashes will be played away on
successive weekends, and could be
the “making” or “breaking” of the
1957 Panther eleven since these
games will be played in the mid-
dle of the season.

Oregon and Southern Califor-
nia will also provide the op-
position on consecutive week-
ends. In fact the Panther grid-
ders will ﬂy to Portland,.0re-
gon, to meet the Webfeet Sept.
28, and remain on the coast un-
til the game with the Trojans
the following Saturday.

The Miami engagement ﬁnds the
Panthers playing under the lights
for only the second time. The oth-
er time was during the ﬁnal tilt of
the .1951 campaign when Acting
Head Coach Tom Hamilton took
over the reigns for the ailing Red
Dawson at the midpoint of the
season and proceeded to beat the
Hurricanes, 21-7. ~

Theodore,_(l:)st Shine; 
Line Play Stops Brown

By ED KOLTISKA

The Panthers ﬁnally came alive last Saturday afternoon
and looked like the ball club that the sports writers picked
to lead the East in their 14-7 triumph over the highly rated
Orangemen of Syracuse at the Stadium. L

Although the score was only 14-7, it did not truly repre-
sent the type of ball that was played by the Oaklanders.
The Panthers picked up 19 ﬁrst downs and 291 yards rush-
ing compared to 12 ﬁrst downs and 172 yards rushing for

Syracuse.

From the opening kick-off,
taken by Corny Salvaterra, the
Panthers took commanding charge
of the game. Salvaterra, with a
backﬁeld comprised of Dick
Bowen, Ray DiPasquale, and team
Captain Tom Jenkins, moved the
ball from their own 34 to the 20-
yard line of Syracuse before giv-
ing it up on downs.

Bagamery Misses Field Goal

The Orangemen made only one
long drive in the ﬁrst period which
covered from their own 20 to the
Panther 18 where Bowen recover-
ed a fumble by quarterback
Chuck Zimmerman. This time
Coach John Michelosen sent in
quarterback Darrell Lewis and
halfback Corky Cost. Lewis on
handoffs to Cost and DiPasquale
moved the ball down»to the 16-
yard l.ine before being stopped by
,the Orange.

After a third down pass went
out of bounds in the end zone,
Bugs Bagamery missed a 24
yard ﬁeld goal attempt. This
gave the ball to the New York-
ers on the 20.

Early in the second quarter, the
Orangemen again found them-
selves trying to stop a drive by
the Panthers. This time Lewis
moved the ball from the 27 yard
line to midﬁeld with Cost carry-
ing the burden. On the next play,
Ed Coffin intercepted a side line
pass intended for Cost on the 35
and raced 65 yards for a score to
put the Panthers behind, 7-0.

Theodore Sparks Drive

It didn’t take the Jungle Cats
long to get started again. Jim
Theodore took ‘over the ground
gaining chores in the second per-
iod from Cost. Running over the
right side of the Syracuse line,
Theodore picked up 5, 11, and 25
yards to place the Panthers on the
Orange 25. With only short gains
going through the middle, Salva-
terra kept to the outside only to
be stopped on the ﬁve-yard line.

The strong forward wall, tu-
tored by Coach Jack Wiley, kept
the Orangemen pinned behind
the 10-yard line to pave the
way for the Oaklander’s first
score.

Don Althouse punted from the
end zone to his 39. Theodore dash-
ed for 14 yards through left tackle
and then over right tackle for

eight. Salvaterra on a keep moved
the ball to the 13. On the next two
plays, Theodore moved the pig-
skin to the ﬁve before Cost tried
the right side for four more yards.
With only one yard to go, Salva-
terra scored on a quarterback
sneak. Bagamery converted to tie
the score, 7-7, at the half.

Orangemen. Zimmerman, on
handoﬁs to Jim Ridlon, Jim
Brown, and Coffin, moved the
ball to midﬁeld before being stop-
ped. With fourth down and one
yard to go, Zimmerman tried a
sneak but was stopped on his 49
by the Panther line.

The Blue and Gold put on the

pressure after Syracuse gambled ‘

with Lewis guiding the attack.
Lewis on a bootleg to the left
carried for 18 yards to the
Orange 30. DiPasquale picked
up 10 on the next two plays.

With the Syracuse line holding
tight on the next two plays, Lewis
took to the air with a pass to Joe
Walton on the five and a touch-
down as Walton crossed the goal
line standing up. Bagamery again
added the extra point to put the
Blue and Gold ahead 14-7.

ension Mounts 
i As Panthers Win ii

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

 
  

 

A "setting in contrast was the Panther and Orange dress-
ing rooms after the Blue and Gold’s 14-7 victory over the
Syracuse Orangemen Saturday. V '

Coach John Michelosen sat exhaustively sprawled on a
chair as reporters incessantly querried the second year mentor.
Michelosen was nervously relaxed, but it was evident that
he was still tense about the outcome of the game.

“We played better than last week but we didn’t
take advantage of our downﬁeld blocking. There was
several times when a back might have gone all the way
had he followed his blocking. There’s still plenty of room
for improvement',” offered Michelosen, although he did

i admit that the_team played better than they did in the
opener against West Virginia.

Asked whether or not the superlative performances of
senior halfback Corky Cost and junior halfback Jim Theodore
would earn then the starting nod against California, Michelo-
sen explained, “The kicking and receiving will determine
the starting backﬁeld. It all depends on the toss of thecoin.”

Solemn John was high in his praise of Cost and Theodore,
though. “Cost is still a spot player because he is handicapped

. by his size (170 pounds). Today he ran into an opposing line-

man and was thrown in his tracks,” stated the Blue and Gold
coach. He referred to Theodore as a stronger runner than
Cost. Thus, it appears that the backﬁeld will remain set for
the California contest with Ray DiPasquale and Dick Bowen
at the halfs, Tom Jenkins at fullback, and Corny Salvaterra
at quarterback if the" Panthers receive; otherwise it will be
Darrell Lewis. '

Concerning the Syracuse defense, Michelosen said,
“Syracuse’s defense wasn’t any more confusing than West
Virginia’s defense. It was just that we had better block-
ing.”

In the visitor’s dressing room, Coach Ben Schwartzwalder
quickly showered and-started to dress. Ben was unhappy over
the loss, of course, yet he seemed so much more relaxed than
did Michelosen. Apparently Ben had the feeling that he had
just ‘been reileved of a burdensome task while Michelosen
sensed the inescapable.-—an undefeated season. '

Schwartzwalder thought that two injustices were work-
ing against his team before they even took the gridiron
against the Jungle Cats Saturday. “West Virginia did Syra-
cuse a great damage when they gave Pitt such a great battle,
and if we had beaten Maryland 7-6 instead of 26-12 it would
have been better for us,” said Schwartzwalder. .

The Orange coach also that that his team was lucky
to be tied 7-7 at the intermission. He referred to the
Panthers as a good, aggressive team that will be tdugh
to beat on any given Saturday.

“You just can’t make an error in a close game like this
and expect to win,” stated Schwartzwalder. However, the
Orange tutor thought his team was getting stronger at the
end and if they could have scored a touchdown early in the
fourth period they would have disorganized the Panthers
and subsequently come on to win. '

Schwartzwalder didn’t think it fair to draw a comparison
between Pitt and Maryland for the obvious reason that
teams vary so much from week to week. And off Maryland’s
C1056 6-0 triumph over Wake Forest, maybe it’s better no
comparison was drawn because it looks like the Terps aren’t
the same power they used to be under Jim Tatum. The
Panthers have that power under Michelosen.

\ A rather true to form week-

' “Game of the Weak” between

Ouachita and College of the

It seems, however, that this 1

terback Otus Swamps faded to
pass. Swamps unleashed one of
the longest forward passes in
the history of the game as the
ball sailed 93 yards into the
hands of Ouachita’s safety man,
Black Jungle.

The rain was falling and the
field was in 11 inches of water
as Jungle set sail for the Ozark
goal line. Both teams began
converging for Jungle and one
of the greatest pileups of all
time resulted. Jungle tried to
submarine the players. He’s lost

Harriers Rout Westminster, 15-50, ‘
With Dead Heat First Place Finish

Coach Carl Olscn’s harriers successfully opened their
1956 season by easily defeating Westminster, 15-50, over the
Schenley trail Saturday.

The Blue and Gold hill and dalers hardly had to work
up a sweat in the season’s opener as they completely out-
classed the visitors from New Wilmington. '

In fact, the Oaklanders won’ soé C
easily that the top four Panther
runners were able to ﬁnish in a
dead heat for ﬁrst place which
was exactly what Coach Olson
wanted them to do.

The four, Jimmy Moore, Vince

Timon, Thorton Smith, and John

l ﬁrst four runners were able to ﬁn-
ish together as he had instructed
them to do if they possibly could.
Sophomores Impressive
Anther thing that impressed
Olson was the strong showing of
sophomores Timon and Christof
who are being counted on heavily
to replace such stars as Arnie
Sowell and Jack Shubert from last
year’s IC4A championship team.
The team strength of the
Jungle Cats was so apparent
that it was never a question of
who was going to win, but how
big a margin would the Olson-
Amen outclass the visitors.

It didn’t take them long to

wound their

cause at the two—mile pole the

Blue and Gold completely domin-

ated the front of the pack as they

J Olsonmen Pull Away

At the three-mile post the ex-
perienced and stronger Olsonmen
began to pull- away from the
Titans who are coached by Dave
Colton. This is Colton’s ﬁrst year
at the helm of the Westminster
harriers, and the young coach just
didn’t have the material to cope
with the locals.

The best indication o" the
Panther strength can be illus-
trated when the veteran Moore
circled back and helped pace

_ one of his teammates -the re-

mainder of the distance.

The next opposition for the O1-
sonmen will come from little
Slippery Rock, Oct. 3, when the
locals dun them over the Schen-
ley trail beginning at 3 p.m.

Law School Test

DatesAnnounced

Law School Admission Test, re-
quired of applicants for admis-
sion to many American law
schools, will be given at more
than 100 centers in the United
States on the following Saturday
mornings: Nov. 10, 1956 and Feb.
16, May 4, and Aug. 10, 1957.

Candidates must make separate
application to each school under
consideration and inquire of each
if the test should be taken. Since
many freshman classes are select-
ed‘ inrthe spring preceding their
entrance, the schools requiring
the test usually advise that stu-

dents take the November or the 1

February administrations.

A bulletin of information and
an application blank should be
obtained four to six weeks before
the desired testing date from Law

Poetry Being S ligh ted

(Continued from Page 1)

he go without that classroom in-
struction which would greatly
speed his development, but, if he
wishes to graduate with a major
in writing, he must also spend
those hours which he would nor-
mally spend in the writing of verse
in writing prose. And this restric-
tion to prose may eventually cause
dissatisfaction with both verse
and prose, for not only will the
poet gradually lose interest in
verse writing through lack of time
devoted to it, but he will soon
come to feel a conﬁnement and
fatal narrowing of his ability to
prose.

But let us suppose that some
energetic student does ﬁnd time
between short stories to write a
verse or two. What does he do
with them? The chances are that
he will give them to his teacher
of prose, who will probably make
some sage comments about the
inadvisability of inverted word or-
der or else ask some devastating
question like “What are you try-
ing to say?"

Or perhaps the teacher may be
even more direct and simply ad-
vise the student to stay clear of
verse altogether. There are, of
course, some teachers who are
willing to read student verse and
give valid criticism. If the poet
has the fortune to receive the
counsel of one of them, he may,
contrary to his short story en-
vironment, develop into a fairly
decent wrtier of verse. But such
teachers are not so readily en-
countered at Pitt. Nor are good
poets. '

But once at Pitt, what unde-
veloped aptitude for verse he has,
is either quickly smothered by
prose, with the poet giving up
verse altogether in order to write
short stories, or elsehe struggles
along his own lonely way against
the disadvantages I have already
mentioned.

Unwelcome Topic

From the foregoing one might
conclude that the writing of verse
is an unwelcome topic at Pitt.
And yet if one were to ask almost
any English teacher at the Uni-
versity what he considers to be
the highest point of literary
achievement, he would quickly
answer poetry.

One answer for this paradox
might be a ﬁnancial one. Poetry,
to say the least has never been a
proﬁtable profession, especially
when one considers that a book
of poetry becomes a best seller
upon selling a mere thousand
copies. But though it may be nec-
essary to emphasize the more lu-
crative short story for ﬁnancial
reasons (since many writing ma-
jors will eventually depend on
the courses they take for their
incomes), this is still no explana-

\

tion for the complete neglect of
verse.

A course in writing verse has
probably never impoverished
anyone. In fact, when one con- -
siders that over ﬁfty percent of
the writing majors at Pitt will
eventually make their livings
at vocations other than writing,
he sees that a year spent in
verse might be considerably

more rewarding than one spent
in prose.

Thus we see to what extent
poetry at the University of Pitts-
burgh has been neglected. It
might be argued that since the
English Department offers a
writing majors program, the
student interested in poetry has
a right to expect and to demand
a verse writing course at Pitt.

This does not seem too inordi-
nate an assumption when one
notes that many schools with little
or no reputation for a writing
division do offer such a course.
In fact, one might even argue
that the University of Pittsburgh
has no right to claim that its
writing division program is su-
perior for when in truth it has
neglected a very major part of
literary creation. There can be no
reason for not offering a course in
writing verse. The potential and
the need for such a course are
present and realized. What, then,
is to be the future of poetry at
Pitt? - «
