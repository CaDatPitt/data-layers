Finney Leads
Home Concert

Of Orchestra

Symphony to Present
Sibelius Work Tonight

In Foster Memorial

. The. 50—piece .University sym-
phony orchestra, conducted by The-
odore M. Finney, associate professor
of music appreciation, will present
its twelfth annual home concert in
Foster Memorial this evening at
8:15 o’clock. 1

Dr. Wendall Otey, instructor in
music appreciation and assistant
conductor of the orchestra, will be
featured soloist. He will present

"Concerto in A Major for Piano
and String Orchestra,” assisted by
the University string orchestra.

The highlight of this evening’s
program will be Andante con Ani-
ma, the first movement of Tschai-
l-:owsky’s Fifth Symphony. Rus-
sia's greatest composer, completed
the work in two months, and two
months later conducted the initial
and unsuccessful performance in

St. Petersburg. The symphony
which is based on characteristic na-
tional themes is now one of the
composers most popular works.

“Finlandia,” Sibelius’ most play-
ed composition, will also be per-
formed. It depicted the strife and
oppression of the Finnish people so
powerfully, that after they had
been deprived of their self—govern-
ment the ﬁrst time by Russia, per-
formances were forbidden.

Overture to “Coriolanus” was
composed by Beethoven in 1807 to

introduce a drama by a German .

poet; and is one of the best known
of his eleven overtures.

Also included in the program will
be Humperdinck’s “Evening Pray-
cr and Dream Pantomime" from the
opera, “Hansel and Gretel.”

“Polonaise” by Rimsky-Korsakoff
and a Bach Chorale—Fugue, “All
Glory Be To God on High,” com-
plete the program.

Tickets may still be obtained at
the activities booth on the ground
floor.

program, Lew Riley, C42, president
of the honorary activities fraternity
for sophomore men, disclosed Mon-
day.

Purpose of the affair is to have
active members become better ac-
guainted with freshman leaders
who have been outstanding in activ-
ities during their first year on
campus. .A program of games, en-
tertainment and refreshments has
been arranged by members of the
organization. Participation is by
invitation.

Political Drive
To Hit Climax
With. Balloting

The calm before the storm de-
scended upon the campus political
front as the ﬁnal week of pre-elec-
tion campaigning began Monday.

No important developments were
brought forward by either the fra-
ternities or independents since Fri-
day’s report of the dissolution of
the women’s fraternity “no politics”
pledge.

Election hours are scheduled for
8:30 to 5:00 o’clock at Memorial
Hall on Friday, according to Sam
Whiteman, BA40, elections chair-
man for SFA.

Identification cards stamped for
second semester and with pictures
attached must be presented at the
pol.ls before the student is permit-
ted to vote, Whiteman declared.
The card will be stamped when the
student obtains his voting permit
and again. after he has completed
balloting. Students who do not
have the necessary credentials must
obtain them this week at the oﬁice
of the registrar, 1817 Cathedral.

Thirty student seats in SFA will
be ﬁlled at the elections. Ten sen-
ior men, ten junior men, ﬁve senior
women, and ﬁve junior men are to
be elected. Each student is entitled
to vote for two men and one woman
in each class.

The four officers in the College
Association: president, vice presi-
dent, secretary, and treasurer are
elected by students registered in
The College. Separate voting ma-
chines are used.

Candidates for the ten. openings
in l‘vlen’s Council will be voted up-
on by men registered in the various
schools in which there are posi-
tions to be ﬁlled. Paper ballots
will be distributed for this voting.

McNeil Disapproves

Attempts on the part of Univer-
sity secretary John. Weber to have
the two hour parking limit on the
Cathedral side of Fifth avenue were
met with this statement by Donald
M. McNeil, city trafﬁc engineer:

“It is a beautiful street since
it has been widened and I’m op-
posed to the Pitt students using
the King’s Highway for a stable.

I think two hoursparking is bet-

ter for a majority of the students.”

When questioned’ by a Pitt News
reporter, McNeil remarked that he
had been quoted correctly by the
paper which originally got his
opinion. He asserted that Dr. Web-
er’s letter would be considered by
a sub-committee of the Better
Traffic committee at a meeting
within the next ten. days.

No comment was expressed by
Dr. Weber on McNei.l"s"statement
as reported in the downtown news-
papers.

PAA Regulations

The Schenley Farms Civic asso-
ciation, through its secr-etary, Frank
Wilbur Main, presented to the Bet-
ter Traffic committee a plan for
stricter regulation regarding park-
ing in the areas around the Ca-
th-edral.

The association asked for prohi-
bition of parking between 8:30 and
10 a. m. and from 6:30 to 8 p. In.
on the following streets:

Bigelow boulevard, both sides,

from Center avenue to Bayard
street.

Bigelow boulevard, both sides,
from its junction with Bayard
street, west. to Parkman avenue,
at the corner of the Twentieth
Century club.

Bayard street, both sides, east
to Belleﬁeld. avenue.

Lytton avenue, Tennyson ave-
nue, both sides.

The requests will be approved
it" a petition signed by more than 51
per cent of the property owners of
any or all streets stated in the pe-
tition is presented to the committee.

The charge for parking on Rusk-
in ﬁeld is necessitated by the fact
that an attendant must be maintain-
ed to prevent looting of cars by
vandals, Mr. Shotts explained.‘

Tippetts Will Conduct

lar and social implications of busi-
ness education at the three-day
convention beginning tomorrow.

Mama Don’t ’Low No Swingin’ Here

Music Library Includes Only Seven Jazz Records

By Ray Palkot

University students who make
the 8,000 calls yearly for records
from the music appreciation depart-
ment cannot afford to be swing
minded, because only .7 per cent
of the discs in the collection of
1.000 are swing, and those can’t be
borrowed.

The reason for the grancl total of
so-ven unused jazz or swing records
which are collecting dust in the
,<-*,roup is that “they represent a form
of music.” The Carnegie Founda-
tion donated the collection, a com-
posite view of music types.

So far, faculty members of the
department have been the only per-
sons who have used the swing rec-
ords.

Students cannot borrow the rec-
ords and listen to them in one of
the four listening rooms on the
fourth floor. Reasons given by
members of the depa.rt.ment is that
students can get them at home,
and besides, the records would go
the way of Tschaikowsky’s Fifth
and Sixth symphonies and the R0-
meo and Juliet overture. which
were worn out and have had to be
replaced.

The swing or jazz records owned
by the University are: Duke Elling-
ton’s “Mood Indigo” and “Black
and White Phantasy; “George Ger-
shwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue;” Ben-
ny Goodman’s “Someday Sweet-
heart” and “Who;” William C. Han-
dy’s “St. Louis Blues;” and Louis
Armstrong’s “Dusky Stevedore.”

Students have very excellent
taste, commented a member of the
music appreciation department.
The faculty have about the same
preferences as the students. How-
ever, it was emphasized that the
swing records would still remain
out of circulation.

of Mines and Engineering.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, Robert R." Corley, assistant
dean of men, and Dr. W. George
Crouch, assistant professor of Eng-
lish will meet in Dean Ho1brook’s
office at 2:30 today to choose the
win-ner of the outstanding engineer-
ing senior ,av.r.ard.

The. most, pro_rnin’ent senior will
lre chosen from a list of ﬁve engi-
neers nominated by the seminars
of the School of Mines and Engi-
neering. Scholastic rating, activity
participation, and “sociability” are
among the merits which will be
considered by the committee.

Each of the five seminars will
present. a stunt during the program
of the smoker. A silver cup will
be awarded to the winner, who may
keep it if won three years in suc-
cession. ‘

The seminar of the department of
industrial engineering won the cup
—.——“for keeps”—last year after three
stunt smok-ers in which they were
acclaimed winners.

Competition is expected to be es-
pecially keen this year, for a new
cup will be awarded, the winner of
which may decide the permanent
holder.

Members of the association will
be admitted upon presentation of
membership cards. Non—members
may purchase cards from the as-
sociation oﬁicers for 25 cents.

So the King’s Highway
Is a Stable - - -

When a. city official this week said that Pitt stu-
dent parking along Fifth avenue turned “the
Kings Highway into a stable,” the City of Pitts-
burgh openly demonstrated an utter lack of un-
derstanding of a serious and complicated situa-
tion. And when this official is revealed as a trafﬁc
engineer, it is the case of a “expert” attempting to
solve the problem by simply calling Pitt students
names.

It does 11ot matter that sleek, shining, chauEeur-
driven. limousines of Pittsburgh Athletic associa-
tion members do not twitch the delicate nostrils

of the nietaphor-slinging official in charge of traffic
problems. i
‘vV"liat: does figure in the case is that the city of
Pittsburgli has taken no positive step to solve the

But we demand from the city a more practical
solution based upon a more realistic viewpoint.

They have answered the pleas of the PAA by
dressing up a special officer. They ea.sed the pres-
sure of Forbes ﬁeld stockholders by reserving the
publicly-owned Schenley plaza for baseball fans.
And they assure Pittsburgh newspapermen that
the wishes of Schenley farms residents will be re-
spected by restrictions on more neighborhood
streets in the near future.

But the rights of the largest group in the dis-
trict——the car driving students, and faculty mem-
bers-—have been ﬂouted completely.

The time is long past for city officials to snap
out of their indifference and take some positive
step to alleviate this Oakland parking situation.

It is not the duty of the University to discover
the solution to this problem. That is the job that
city officials are paid to do. The solution rests
squarely upon their shoulders.

The Bawdy Politic
By S. F. Ayers

H oeveler Scores Again

The story of one of the best examples of political
management to hit the University campus in several
years is contained in the list of 60 nominees for positions
in the Student—Faculty Association assembly.

Until this year, the fraternity members of the SFA
executive committee were careful to keep unslated fra-
ternity members off the nomination list, to avoid even
the slightest chance that they would draw votes away
from the regular slate candidates. But this year the
situation. was reversed, thanks to the political astuteness
of Independent leader Jack Hoeveler.

This year, the fraternities are running four slates,
the Independents three. This makes a total of 42 can-
didates slated, 24 by fraternities, 18 by the Independ-
ents. Here’s the signiﬁcant point: of the 18 remaining
candidates, unslated by either party, 13 are fraternity
men and women, while only 5 are non—fraternity.

This means that there is slight chance of any appre-
ciable loss of Independent votes from the regular slates
to the unslated candidates for SFA.

”.l‘is said that in the meeting of the SFA executive
committee when the nominations were decided, Hoevel-
er worked hard to have unslated fraternity men nom-
inated, while he prevented the nomination of many
unslated Independents by claiming that they were not
able to handle the jobs.

Patronage Department

Both the Fraternities and Independents seem conﬁ-
dent of clean sweeps for all their slates, if all the prom-
ises and tentative promises for SFA executive. commit-
tee jobs are going to be kept. V

Independents are reported to have promised three
executive committee jobs-—to Fred Robie, Dave Tucker,
and Adele Yorio. Under this setup, Robie would be

TSFA. president and Miss Yorio secretary, provided the
Independents get a majority in therassernbly.

‘Dark horses on the Independent executive commit-
tee list are Bill McElwain and Rugy Aldisert, who have
done most of the party’s important work this year.

On the ‘Fraternity side of the fence, one man may be
sure of his job next year-—Joe Roberts, Phi Gam hope,
and future president of SFA. Promises are also on the
books to Gene Pyle, Kappa, who is to get SFA secretary,
and Dave Buente, Delt, also slated for an executive com-
mittee post.

And when this triumvirate has been taken care of,
the question is, what will Phi Delt Rae Young, Theta
Mary Lewis, and Dent Bob I-Ieape get? Maybe one of
them will be chairman of Scholars’ Day!

Guess Who Department

What Independent candidate, who is also a Druid,
has been trying to bite the hands that have been feed-
ing him?

This gentleman, who reached his present position by
virtue of a coalition of Independents, Phi Gums, and Pi
Lams, was recently heard to declare in no uncertain
terms that “No Pi Lam or Phi Gam will become a Druid
,this.year__.-”. v

‘It seems that the Independent party have gotten wise
to his actions, and have buried him on their “graveyard
slate.”

‘Drivel’ Drivel

Editor, the Pitt News:

You can ﬁnd that 5,4; inch of space that you’ve been
looking for at the top of Bob I-Iamilton’s column. The
attitude in it makes its title, Drivel, so self-evident that
its printing makes the space waste seem shameful.

First, of course, I want to thank you for having in-
cluded me in his middle class. It’s certainly necessary
for we members of the middle class to have a con-
sciousness of kind. What with the Reds undermining
our institutions; the government leaving us with just
ten thousand per year; and the women marrying us for
our money, things are certainly uncomfortable.

Bob’s courage is strong and powerful. In fact, so
potent and present that some of it even overﬂowed into
his column. Yep, it sure feels good to read the wisdom
of someone who believes in courage. Courage is some-
thing very stimulating and nutritious". Scientists pre-
dict that the Weir laboratories will soon be able to
prove that one dose of courage per day is sufﬁcient to
provide 1500 calories per day that we humans need.

An occasional stimulating Fordism, thrown in once
in a while, ought to provide enough kick to substantiate
the WCTU in its claim that liquor is unnecessary for
the people. Great stuff this courage.

Tell Bob that I’m hitching up to Detroit next week
and he can come along if he wishes.

Spectator Adds
To Hamilton’s Woes

Editor, the Pitt News:

The first remark for the day is for the author of
Drivel. How appropriate, Mr. Hamilton! Let me say
that I greatly admire your abstract principles, which are
obvior-sly superior to my own. It is a great thing to
find a man who will die in the protection of an ideal.
Medieval. Europe and the American Indians were very
prou.d of such things, and so . . congratulations!

But, by the way, Mr. Hamilton, I shall feel that you
are indeed a master of idealistic values the day that
you manage to comfort somebody’s heart-broken wife
or sweetheart with the courage of their principles.

Let me paraphrase Lowell’s immortal poem, “After
the Burial,” for you:

“’Con'mwnion in spirit? Forgive me

But I who am earthly and weak

For the . . touch of his hand on my check.”

That, Mr. Hamilton, is the piteous cry of bereaved
womanhood, but of course, it doesn’t matter . it's
the principle of the thing.

And now to another matter: viz., a certain ostrich-
like It-Can’t-Happen-Here attitude on the part of col-
lege students who should know better. It might inter-
est them to know that the students of 1916 felt exactly
the so no way about the pending struggle but thought
it their bound duty to do nothing about it. It didn’t
concern them, and they weren’t interested. Many of
them now raise rather excellent poppies in Flanders
Field, but they aren’t much interested in that, either.

And so . . we’ll have no active drive for peace.
We’l1 merely drift along until a letter comes from the
government stating that it has stuck its political neck
out once too often and that we are elected to preserve
the . . national honor, is it?
forms are so becoming; don’t take my word for it .
ask any girl.

Cathedral Room ‘Themes’

By E. Seymour Kerber

Among the factors holding the
completion of the remainder of the
Cathedral classrooms off the build-
ing schedule has been the “theme”
for the rooms.

Back when the Frick Acres was
contemplated, nationality rooms,
historical rooms, and contemporary
culture and industry rooms, all cor-
related to Western Pennsylvania,
were to form the “motif” for the
design.

But the project has been tem-
porarily discarded and a new idea,
departmental rooms, is now being
discussed. First to come forth with
suggestions for a new design has
been the mathematics department.
Two different constructions are
advocated, a circular room with
electrically driven blackboards so
that the pro.*.'essor can stand in
only one place and write around
the wall, and an acoustical room
based upon the conics of Appollo-
nius.

Parabolic ceilings, according to
the propagators of the scheme,
would be the Utopian thing for lec-
turers with colds. The rostrum
could be placed at one of the foci
of the conic and even whispered
words would carry all over the
room. In case a coughing spell came
to the instructor during the lee-
ture, he need only move from the
focal point——and his loudest cough
couldn’t disturb the students.

Most interesting of the rooms
could be the journalism room. Pre-
liminary plans of interested work-
ers show a room financed by the
three local papers in return for
hanging pictures of Hearst, Howard,
and Block. (If you insist, we’ll

H hang Hearst, Howard, and Block).

Each desk could be provided with
a typewriter, a cuspidor, and copy-
paper. .
The room should never be
cleaned. Periodically, the students
could dump litter out into the ball,
then the janitors could tow it away.
To make for more atmosphere, stu-
dents would work in their shirt-
sleeves with their hats on.

Special attention will be devoted
to the lecture stand in this room
also. Suggestions run from linotype
machines, through standard font

Junior Women Defend Spring
Festival W7ee.k Sports Crown

Junior coeds will go after their
second straight championship lov-
ing cup when the University’s an-
nual week-long sports program
opens on Monday, May 6.

Inaugurated last year as a spe-
cial attraction of Spring Festival
week, the coeds’ competition will
be based on an aggregate point sys-
tem by claasses.

Various outdoor sports slated for
the all-women event include: arch-
ery, tennis, volley ball, shuffle-
board, mushball, ‘and badminton.
Sidewalk contests will offer a novel
sidelight. Sites of the contests
have not been deﬁnitely decided,
although it is probable that arch-

ery matches will be run off on the
Cathedral lawn. The Pitt Stadium,
may provide the battle grounds for'/
the other sports if the weatherman
makes up his mind.

Last year over 100 women took
part in the program which will
again be open to all University co-
eds. All women interested are
asked to ﬁll out the blank printed
elsewhere on this page and return
it to the basket room of the Ca-
thedral Gym or to the dean of wo-
men’s office.

The Women’s Athletic Associa-
tion will again be in charge of the
event with Melva lvlakrauer, Ed4=0,
serving; as chairman, and Adele Yo-
rio, Ed41, publicity chairman.

Ten lloldovers  

To Aid Grady

Although six key men will be l.ost
to coach Ben Grady for his 1940-41
swimming campaign, 10 holdovers
will return to defend Pitt’s Eastern
Collegiate crown.  ,

Captain Al Slobodian, Milton and
Hyman. Lederstein, Al Beacon, Bob
Schraeder, and Allan Dill will bid
adieu to the Cathedral with June
Commencement exercises.

Veterans Joe Orloff, Ike Samson,
and Al Fedor are the nucleus around
which Grady plans to build his free
style squad. Grady plans to use the
versatile Fedor for backstroke duty
as well. In this division, Fedor will
have a capable assistant in new-
comer Andy Mosko.

Orloff, who did exceptionally well
in this year’s campaign, plans to
keep in shape by lifeguarding at
Lake Erie this summer. Gus Wilde,
moving up from this year’s fresh-
man squad, is expected to give the
free style veterans plenty of com-
petition for first man honors.

Herb Cosgrove and Vety Schul-
ness will again be listed with the
breaststroke swimmers while stand-
‘bys Dick Ames and Joe Kaule will
be back to take care of the diving
duties. Jack Bodnar and Marty
Krambri will be contenders for a
distance swimming post.

Kracum, Ross Hurt
In Early Workouts
Of Gridiron Squad

By Bert Jaffe

That fellow with the big smile
you may have seen walking into
the new athletic office in Trees
Gym is “Chisel” Bowser, Pitt’s
football coach.

Yes, Charley is smiling now
that the unpredictable April
weather has taken a change for the
better and has given him a chance
to get a line on next year’s varsity.

One slight hitch in the program
is the fullback situation. Whether
the up-back spot on the Panther
eleven is jinxed or not, Bowser,
like his predecessor, ﬁnds the going
dimcult in keeping two legs under
his “third and two” getters.

When the “dream backﬁeld” was
in action, “Biggie” Goldberg warm-
ed the bench because of a leg in-
jury, suffered late "in ‘the season,
and since the _ beginning of this
year’s gridiron work, practically
every candidate for the line crush-
ing job has been laid up at one time
or another.

George Kracum has been shifted
from left half to fullback and from
there to the hospital list with a bum
ankle. Joe Ross, ﬁrst alternate, is
also on the injured list.

However, the squad is slowly
rounding into form, and the ﬁrst of
the intra-squad games will take
place on Saturday if the weather
permits.

The Blue team or ﬁrst ball club
will be made up of Stan Gervelis
and Joe Rettinger at the terminals,
Ted Konetsky and “Tiger” Benz at
tackle, Rudy Gradisek and Ralph
Fife at the guard positions, and
rugged Steve Since at the pivot

spot.

A Carrying the mail in true Pitt
fashion will be “Special Delivery”
Jones and Bob .Thurbon at left
and right halfbacks, respectively,
with Mike Sekela barking the sig-
nals, and Kracum, if his injury
heals, as the number four back.
Acting in the capacity of second
team or the Golds will be Al Gurc-
rcinski, a reformed tackle, and Jack
Goodridge at ends; Harry Kindel—
berger and “Bing” Benghouser, two
tenth-a—ton tackles; Johnny Kapur-
ka, a former end, and either George
1‘-/litchell or Paul Foley at guards;
and Harry Hawkins ﬁghting it out

 

Pitt Linksmen
Seek to Better
l939Winl\la1°k

This year’s varsity golf team
won’t have to go far to beat the rec-
ord compiled by last year’s outﬁt.

The linkmen won only one East-

ern Intercollegiate association
match last year while dropping
four. Their season record, includ-
ing non league games, was better,
however, for they won ﬁve out of
11 played.

The rub of the matter is that the
two men who accounted for all
Pitt’s victories last year, Bill Dad-
die and Tony Kay, have graduated,
leaving only Bill Reilly, Homer
Mcclintock, Bob Seybold,“ Norm
Sam, and any new recruits who

may develop this year to carry the
loads.

The boys open the season Friday
at State College when they meet
the Penn State Lions.

End-Dian

with George Allshouse for the cen-
ter berth.

Two freshmen stars, Wascovich
and Saksa, are playing in the sec-
ond team backﬁeld, Wascovich at
quarterback and Saksa at left
half. Ernie Bonelli has been shifted
from fullback to right half, and
line-bucker Ross rounds out the
ball club.

Cage Classes

Basketball spring training will

be dropped this year in favor of a
basketball class composed of all
boys interested in the game, ac-
cording to Dr. H. C. Carlson, bas-
ketball mentor.
The classes will start next Mon-
day and will be held four times a
week, on Monday, Tuesday, Thurs-
day, and Fri-
day. All boys
who were in the
freshman Polar
league are urged
to report.

1-’ articipation
in the class is
optional for up-
perclass varsity
members but all
other boys who
want to try out
for the varsity
must join.

Boys who in-
tend joining are
to report to the Stadium at 3:30
o’clock on Monday, April 22. They
will be assigned lockers and will
be given one hour of instruction.

Sigma Chi Meets Sigma. Alpha Epsilon
In Battle of Undefeated Ninesr Today

By Alex Zelenski

Snow and cold blasts of ‘wind,
remnants of winter, postponed last
‘week-end’s active participation in
intramural mushball and horse-
slices.

Bad weather has been Director
.l‘ames Potts’ main rival all year
with games having been frequently
postponed. Games that were called
off will be played at the end of the
current season.

Two undefeated fraternity teams
will strive to keep their slates clean
today when Sigma Chi battles Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon. Sigma Chi owns
one victory to date, 14-7 triumph
over Pi Kappa Alpha. Starzynski
is the big gun in the Sigma Chi
lincup,las was shown by his hit-
ting in the PiKA game.

Don Cefaratti who pitched three
hit ball in his first start, will prob-
ably be on the mound for the SAE
team. Acreps is the leading SAE
hitter.

Phi Delta Theta and Delta Tau
Delta will meet on Field 1 at 5
o’clock. Phi Delta Theta is as yet
untested, for their previous games
have been postponed. They were
runners-up to the championship
team last y-ear, and should prove
again to be one of the top notch
teams. Delta Tau Delta, with plen-
‘Cy Of power in such hitters .,a.,s,
Efenghouser, Narick, Young, "and
Crunkleton, might prove a stumbling

bl.ock"in the Phi Delts road to the
crown.

A pitchers battle should be the
result as Pi Lambda Phi tangles
with the strong'Phi Kappa defense.
Bert Jaffe, one of last year’s out-
standing pitchers, will attempt to
stem the Phi Kap tide. Joe Con-
nell will hurl for the Phi Kaps.

T'heta Chi and Kappa Sigma bat-
tle on Field 2 at 5 o’clock today.
Both teams have had a taste of fra-
ternity competition this year and
should stage a close contest.

The Gamma Gamma Woos, last
year’s independent title holder, will
try to achieve their ﬁrst victory of

the season. when they meet the
YMCA team at 4 o’clock on Field 2.

The Y1‘:/f[CA’s were defeated in
their first game by the strong Car-

v dinal ball club, but have since then

improved considerably. Gamma
Gamma Woos will have with them
the veterans of last year, Babe
Stark, Howard Swartz, George Vin-
egar, Joe Aaron, and Charles Sap-
per.

T‘omorrow’s mushball schedule
will ﬁnd Phi Epsilon Pi facing the
Fijis and SAM opposing the Pi
Lams at 3 o’clock. At 5 o’clock
Lambda Chi Alpha battles SAE and
Sigma Chi meets Phi Kappa.

Racqueteers Duel for Positions
In Preparation for Ohio State

A tournament to determine the
line-up for Pitt’s opening tennis
match with Ohio State is in full
swing this week. The net duel with
the Buckeyes is scheduled for a
week from today, but the team’s
personnel will be decided by Fri-
clay.

The ﬁrst four spots in the net
line-up are assured to veterans Joe
Kristufek, Frances Harmuth, Ed
Goehring, and Dudley Weiss. This
week’s court battles will decide the
other two places.

Most of the matches in the open-
ing round of the tourney were one-
sided affairs. Bob Nickeson trip-
ped John Crosby, 6-2, 6-0; Bob
Martin beat Maurice Citron, 6-0,
6-0; Marsh Nesbitt trounced Sam
Barone, 6-0, 6-0; Frank Gaenger
defeated Shep Ungar, 6-2, 6-3; and
Martin came back to win his second
match of the day, stopping Nesbitt,
6-2, 6-1.

Gaenger topped Martin in a close
match, 6-4, 7-5 in the next round
of the tournament. Martin was not

Buckeyes in Initial
Outdoor Encounter

Risking a two year victory string,
Pitt’s track and ﬁeld men open
their 1940 outdoor season this Sat-
urday at Columbus in a dual en-
gagement against the Ohio State
cindermen.

Although Johnny Woodruff’s ab-
sence can’t help being felt, the team
boasts tough all around strength
to make a strong bid for eastern
outdoor supremacy again this sea-
son. Saturday should ﬁnd the
spiked shoe brigade in good enough
shape to down the Buckeyes.

The strength of Larry Snyder’s
outﬁt is concentrated in three men,
Jack Sulzman, crack quarter miler;
Steve Linta, Big Ten indoor pole
vault titlist; and Jack Eisenhart,
middle distance star.

Nickeson eliminated Ungar by the

The contest has narrowed to three
men, Gaenger, Nickeson, and Mar-

outﬁt, while Martin is a veteran of
the 1939 varsity.

New Law Dean
To Take Post
ln Septeinhei'

University Officials
Praise Dr. Gilmore’s
Administrative Ability

Dr. Eugene A. Gilmore, newly-
appointed dean of the University
School. of Law and president of the
University of Iowa, will take over
his post at the University no later
than September 1, Rufus H. Fitz-
gerald, provost, announced Monday.
He will succeed Judge Alexander
Thompson.

Announcement of the new ap-
pointment by the Board of Trustees
brought favorable comments upon
the new dean.

"A Very Fine Person”

Said Chancellor John G. Bowman,
in commenting upon the appoint-
ment. “Dr. Gilmore has long been
distinguished as a leader in this
country. I am, of course, much
pleased to have a man of his excel-
lence and wealth of experience
come to our School of Law.”

Dean Thompson said: “I’ve known
Mr. Gilmore for a good many years.
He is a competent law teacher, a
man of administrative experience,
a very fine person. He will make a
ﬁne dean.”

Judge Elder Marshall, professor
of law, commented in a similar
manner in speaking of the presi-
dent of the University of Iowa:
“He is one of the really outstand-
ing educators of the middle west.
He will be a decided addition to the
cultural side of Pittsburgh . . . a
great beneﬁt to the students and
faculty, and will be a welcome ad-

dition to the legal profession of
western Pennsylvania.”

Thompson VVell-Known

Judge Thompson, who came to
the University in 1902 as professor
of international law, has been a
well—known ﬁgure in district law
circles for more than thirty years.
He was active on the law depart-
ment of the city of Pittsburgh and
became solicitor for many small
communities near the city. Dean
Thompson was a member of the
Liquor Control board for two years.

While a member of the Univer-
sity faculty he was secretary of the
Law school previous to his appoint-
ment to the dean’s chair.

Business Activity
Increases Slightly

A slight rise in business activity
in the Pittsburgh district was evi-
denced last week, according to the
University’s Bureau of Business Re-
search.

The gain was due largely to the
pronounced advance in the depart-
ment store sales and the fairly
heavy volume of new motor car
registration. Steel mill activity and
blast furnace operations remained
unchanged.

Although department store sales
were somewhat smaller last week
than in the week ended April 8.
1939, they were more than 44 per
cent greater than those in the pre-
ceding week, an increase far larger
than seasonal.

The bureau’s seasonally adjusted
index of business rose from 99.9 per
cent of the 1923-25 average in the
week ended March 30 to 100.1 last
week; it was 102.2 in the week end-

ed March 23 and 100.8 in the week

ended March 16.

Students Would Continue
Features of New Deal

Program, Survey Shows

By Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN, Texas, April 16——Apparently in agreement with the na-
tional feeling as expressed in recent presidential primaries, almost all col-
lege students believe that there are parts of the New Deal that should be
continued—-—regardless of the winning party in November’s elections.

The Civilian Conservation Corps, the National Youth Administration,

the Works Progress Administration,
and social security are the most
popular agencies among collegians,
it is pointed out by the latest na-
tional sampling conducted by Stu-
dent Opinion Surveys of America.
A Chance For Youth

College students of today will to
a great extent ﬁll the positions of
importance and and inﬂuence when
they become established in the na-
tion. Most of America’s molders of
public opinion will be college ‘train-
ed men and women. The Surveys,
th.en, may be pointing to new trends
in United States affairs that "may
com-e to full develpoment in a de-
cade or two, it is believed.

A chance for youth, jobs for the

unemployed, security for the un-*

fortunate-—-Uncle Sam, the social
guardian—-that is where college
approval falls heaviest.

CCC is Popular

Personal interviewers asked a
cross-section of all collegians in
the country: “Regardless of which
party wins thegelection in Novem-
ber, what parts of the New Deal do
you think should be continued?”

Of the total number of times that
(lift'erent agencies were named:

C. C. C. was mentioned 18 %.

N. Y. A. was mentioned 15%.

W. P. A. was mentioned 7%.

Social Security
7%.

All others mentioned 44 %.

Very few students believe that the
entire New Deal program should be

0

 

was mctnioned

discarded. Most students mentioned
several agencies; approval of others
covered entire ﬁelds, such as pro-
tection of natural resources, and at-
tempts to solve unemployment.
Opinion in different sections of the
country is remarkably even, the sur-
vey shows, and approval comes
from students of both Republican
and Democratic leanings.

Students Meet
At Convention

Final arrangements for the sev-
enth annual Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on. Government are nearing
completion, with the advance guard
arriving in l‘-larrisburg last night,
and the main body of the University
delegation preparing, to leave to-
morrow night, Sam Rodgers, C40,
delegation chairman, indicated to-
(lay.

Ruggero Aldisert, C41, is public-
ity director for the entire assembly
which will comprise delegates from
40 Pennsylvana universities and
colleges. Esther Marcuson, C41,
has been named secretary of the
foreign affairs committee, and Macy
Levin, C40, will serve as chairman
of the taxation committee.

Calls Hungar_y’s
. Position \Veak

“Hungary is as defenseless and
as uncertain as was Denmark,” de-
clared Dr. Alexis Mathe, Hungarian
educator and journalist before
Monday’s Inquiry Forum, in a re-
sume of the “Political and Economic
Situation in Central and South
Eastern Europe.”

Pointing out that the small na-
tions of Europe today must, for
their own safety, remain neutral in
action, Dr. Mathe proceeded to de-
nounce the methods and policies of

Nazi Germany. He praised the
“political genius” of France and
Great Britain, but sympathized

with the “political ignorance of the
United States.” '

AlthoIughDr. Mathe admitted in
query that the British :and jFt*e_n.ch
have not too forcefully demonstrat-
ed their political genius -during the
past 20 “years, he fexpi-Ie‘ss'ed' the
hope of his people "for an Allied vic-
