Pittsburgh Pride Week: ‘You belong ’

Dylan Drobish carried Pitt’s Rain-
bow Alliance banner down the
Boulevard of the Allies during
Sunday’s Pride Awareness March.
He marched shirtless with an aqua-
colored sticker that read “Queer”
covering his right nipple and a pale
yellow question mark sticker cover-
ing his left.

Three years ago, Drobish came

The Pittsburgh LGBT community showed off its pride

ﬁrst time as a heterosexual ally —
and as a woman.

Now, as Rainbow Alliance’s
vice president and an outspoken
transsexual, Drobish embodies the
theme of this year’s Pride Week:
“You belong.” '

“Every year it has gotten easier
to be out,” Drobish said.

Attending Pittsburgh’s pride
festival and being at Pitt played
a part in getting Drobish to this
point, he said. He joined about 20
current and former Rainbow A1-

liance members who marched in’
the city’s largest pride festival.Pitt
students and alumni also lined the
streets for PrideFest, the festival
that followed the parade, to show
their support for gay rights.
Drobish and other members of
Rainbow Alliance beckoned their

friends to join the parade as they

marched down the Boulevard of the
Allies, Wood Street, Fifth Avenue
and onto Sixth Street before the
parade ended on Liberty Avenue.
PrideFest is the only celebration

that shuts down Liberty Avenue
from 10th Street to Sixth Street,
and this year the festival closed
down an extra block to accommo-
date more vendors.

“Pitt is always here in one way
or another,” Pitt alumnus John
Musser said. '

During his time at Pitt, Musser
gained campus celebrity status
through his drag queen persona
Veronica Bleaus. Musser played
a central role in the annual Rain-

Assistant Sports Editor

Editor’s note: This is the ﬁrst of
a three—part series taking an in-
depth look at the psychology of
sports fans.

Denny DeLuca and his friend
were enjoying a Steelers game at
Heinz Field last year, until a locust
decided to go for a swim.

“It kept dive-bombing my
friend’s Coke,” DeLuca said. “It
must have been the sugar in it or
something.” i ‘

DeLuca covered the cup to cap-
ture the locust after it splashed
into the sugary softdrink. Then,
he took it home.

He painted it gold, and now it
hangs above a TV in the basement.
This might seem odd, but in De-
Luca’s basement, this bug is among
hundreds of mementos in his Steel-
ers room. He has spent countless
hours painting ﬁgurines and ﬁnd-
ing souvenirs for this room. By this
point, the dead bug hanging from
the ceiling is barely noticeable
upon ﬁrst glance. ,

On the surface, professional
sports consist of a bunch of grown
men getting paid millions of dol-
lars to play a game. But if that’s
all there is to it, then why do fans
spend hundreds —— if not thou-
sands — of dollars to cheer on
these athletes?

Some fans give time, effort and

From Pitt to the Gulf   -

Pitt engineering professor develops a new way to help clean up oil spills

Michael Macagnone
Assistant News Editor

With the power of cotton and an ar-
tiﬁcial polymer, a new ﬁlter designed
by Pitt professor Di Gao looks like
it should be marketed by the late
Billy Mays.

In a YouTube video, Gao pours a
dirty-looking mixture over a single
sheet of cotton, leaving sludge-like
oil above and water below. The mira-
cle product is no television gimmick,
either. Gao’s ﬁlter could soon be used
to help clean up the massive oil spill
devastating the Gulf of Mexico.

The announcement last week
about Gao’s work prompted a bit of
media attention, which the Pitt re-
searcher partly credits for the prog-
ress he has made in marketing his
invention. A contractor for BP has
contacted Gao since the announce-
ment, and both sides are working to
get the new ﬁlter technology ready
for use in the Gulf.

Gao is still working on determin-
ing the best method for employing
the ﬁlter. He has several ideas for
how to use the ﬁlter including drag-
ging a trough behind a ship and
making a giant bucket to contain
the oil.

He said that British Petroleum
might also be able to use the ﬁlter
to help protect coastlines by add-
ing lengths of the polymer-treated
cotton to existing booms as a kind
of skirt, hanging down in the water
and preventing oil from escaping
below the surface. A

Making the ﬁlter seems to be al-
most as easy as tie—dying. To make
his ﬁlter, Gao dipped a piece of cot-
ton in the polymer solution, then
let it air dry.

The process is not only simple
but cheap too. Gao said that it will

cost about 10 cents per square foot
to manufacture.

Gao and his colleagues have been
working on polymers, like the one
used in the ﬁlter, for almost ﬁve
years. They started working on
the most recent polymer ab out ﬁve
months ago, several months before
BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig ex-
ploded in April.

Since that explosion on April
20, as many as 30,000 barrels of
oil a day have spilledinto the Gulf,
prompting a massive effort to con-
tain and clean up the leaking petro-
leum.

’ To make the ﬁlter, Gao and his
team designed a polymer “very un-
common in nature.” The solution
is so uncommon because it is both
oleophobic and hydrophillic —— it re-
pels oil but bonds to water. When ap-
plied to cotton, the polymer allows
water, but not oil, to pass through.

While Gao’s ﬁlter may sound like
a miracle cure, it must clear a great
deal of scrutiny before hitting Gulf
waters.

Two of the organizations in-
volved in the cleanup, BP and the
Deepwater Horizon Incident Com-
mand — an organization of local,
state and federal agencies -— have
taken in tens of thousands of sug-
gestions for cleaning up the oil
since the spill began. Each proposed
method undergoes a series of steps.
designed to ﬁnd the best workable
solutions.

Heidi Feick, aspokeswoman for
BP, said that its alternative technol-
ogy program had taken more than

100,000 suggestions since the spill '

began and has put each through a
four-stage process before approv-
al.

At each stage of the process, a
team of engineers evaluates the

suggestions to determine if they are
effective at cleaning up the oil. An-
other main consideration is whether
the suggestions are economically
feasible, Feick said.

The length of BP’s approval pro-
cess will vary based on the idea, Fe-
ick said, and whether it needs EPA
approval. -

Feick said that until a suggestion
makes it through the process, she
won’t be able to comment on it.

About 10 percent of the sugges-
tions submitted to BP have dealt
with actually stopping the spill, but
Feick said that most have dealt with
cleanup.

More than 200 of the sugges-
tions have made it to the ﬁnal stage;
testing, Feick_said.

“We’ve set up a system to make
sure every idea gets looked at,” Fe-
ick said.

Gao thinks the uniqueness of
his ﬁlter could help it clear BP’s
hurdles.

Mostpolymerﬁlters are designed
the other way around, Gao said, let-
ting oil through, but not water. That
presents problems when cleaning
up oil spills inwater, Gao said. Even
in the worst spills, there will still
be much more water than oil, and
Gao said the sheer mass of water can
prevent conventional ﬁlters from
being effective.

Gao said that the environmental
effects of his ﬁlter will be minimal,
although they will test the ﬁlters’
impact further. The leech rate —
the amount of polymer that comes
off of the cotton — is very low. “It’s
very strongly bonded to the fabric,”
Gao said.

Only a single layer of the polymer
molecules is bonded to the cotton,
meaning there isn’t much to leech
away, Gao said.

tested and talk about it.
“Of the 56,000 new HIV infec-

tions that happen each year, half

are men who have sex with men,”
Musser said. “There’s a lot to be
done here.”

Pitt representatives occupied
a similar booth at the festival. The
booth, sponsored by the Pitt Men’s
Study for the Graduate School of
Public Health, offered free con-
doms, pamphlets and foam stress
relievers shaped like butts.

The stress relievers beckoned,
“Don’t be an ass — get tested for
HIV.” Research assistant Nathaniel
Soltesz said the organization offers
free HIV testing.

“We’re recruiting for some guys
to participate [in our study] but
mainly to be part of the commu-
nity,” Soltesz said.

Christine Bryan, a spokes-
woman for the Delta Foundation,
which advocates for GLBT rights,
said Pride Week’s theme is more
positive than last year’s theme,
“Your rights, Our Rights, Human

PrideFest closes Liberty

Rights.” ,

She said this year’s theme has
led to conversation about repeal-
ing the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t
Tell” policy and consideration to
amend the Pennsylvania Human
Relations Act, to include “sexual
orientation” and “gender identity
or expression” in protecting people
against discrimination in employ-
ment and housing. ’

A possible repeal of the 1993
“don’t ask, don’t tell” law, which
bars openly gay people from

the Houseand the Senate Armed
Services Committee at the end of
May. _ A _

A few protesters gathered on_
Grant Street near the start of the
parade and preached that homo-
sexuality is sinﬁil.

Rainbow Alliance President
James Weaver said he prefers not to
pay attention to people who protest
homosexuality.

“It’s irritating because I’m a
Christian,” Weaver said. “The
people who are at the parade are
already comfortable with who they
are. You’re not going to change
their minds.” ,

The parade included ﬂoats,
beauty pageant winners-, a drag
queen camouﬂaged as roses climb-

' ing a white fence andlmany shirt- ”

less men, like Drobish.

“When you go to a sporting
event, people go without shirts and
wear paint to show pride in their
team,” Drobish said. “It’s like that

pride in your team, but it’s pride in '

who you are.”

SGB still busy

Student Government Board taking time to allocate funds

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

While the bulk of Pitt’s student body is
focused on landing a last—minute summer
job or picking a vacation spot, its student
government is busy divvying up money for
sports clubs and periodical subscriptions.

The board has allocated more than
$12,000 since the end ofthe spring semes-
ter, splitting the money between ﬁve athletic
clubs as they prepare for their fall seasons.

Organizations that received funds so far
include Pittsburgh Club Baseball, Men’s and
Women’s Ultimate Frisbee clubs and Shoto—
kan Karate Club. '

One application for funding, from Pan-
-ther Field Hockey, is still pending. So is a
decision on whether to bring The New York
Times and USA Today college readership
programs to campus.

The original proposal made by the pub-
lications was to bring 500 issues of each
periodical a day for the fall and spring se-
mesters, according to an e—mail sent by SGB
president Charlie Shull.

In addition to the papers, each publi-
cation would regularly bring journalists to

campus for lectures and workshops at no
additional cost. The publications would also
hostjeopardy games “to challenge the world
knowledge of Pitt students,” all for a price
tag of $60,000.

Shull said the board felt the original pro-
posal was too expensive and asked for a new
deal, which would reduce the number each
publication delivered daily to 300 — nearly
cutting the cost of the program in half.

The second deal is still under debate,
Shull said. i '

Other activity from the board during
the past weeks include a revamping of the
Student Vote Coalition, piloted by the gov-
ernmental relations chairwoman Alexa

Jennings, and meetings with representa-
tives from Pitt’s GPSA, Duquesne’s Student
Government Association, Carnegie Mellon’s
undergraduate and graduate student gov-
ernment and Point Park’s United Student
Government.

At the meetings, Shull and other board
members sought to continue work on a con-
stitution that would create the Pittsburgh
Student Government Council. Shull said the
groups would convene for a third time injuly
to ﬁnalize the document and begin ratifying
it before fall semester.

Overturn
blood ban

onating blood is perhaps
D the simplest way to help

save lives. It’s free, it’s fast
and you will at most have to bear a
slight pinch.

But some individuals are in-
eligible to donate. Donors have to
be at least 17 years old and weigh
at least 110 pounds, but when it
comes to restrictions based on life-
style, gays and lesbians in particu-
lar have felt cheated.

Any man who has had sex with
another man since 1977 even once
is forever banned from donating
blood, according to Food and Drug
Administration guidelines.

The rule, implemented in 1983,
was a precaution against allow-
ing HIV-positive individuals to
give blood and potentially infect

receivers.

Now, the FDA is considering
overturning this restriction. Many
gay—rights groups believe anti-gay
and anti—lesbian feelings spurred
and perpetuated the ban, and
they’re adamantly calling for its
removal;

Even if the restriction was only
an attempt at added caution, it was
initiated before crucial testing to
detect HIV in donated blood sam-
ples existed. _

But today, donated blood is
screened for HIV, making the pos-
sibility of a tainted sample much

. less likely. While there is still rea-

son to be cautious, the blanket
ban is a restriction that testing
and more appropriate screening
should adequately replace.

HIV rates among men who have
sex with men are a cause for con-
cern even today.

A report that the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
published in March shows that
men who have sex with men ac-

count for the most new HIV in-
fections in the United States each
year. Of the more than 1 million
cases of people living with HIV in
the United States, nearly half can
be attributed to men who have sex
with men. '

Yet, even if the ﬁgures hold
sway, there is still a sizeable pop-
ulation of uninfected gay and bi-
sexual men without HIV who can’t
donate because of their lifestyles.
When the ban was instated, rates
of HIV in gay men were exorbitant
compared to today’s rates.

Male-to-male sexual contact
accounted for nearly 80,000 HIV
cases in the United _States around
1983, according to the CDC. In
2006, ma1e—to-male sex caused
an estimated 28,700 cases.

In a First World nation like the
United States, the need for blood
never ends.

According to the American Red
Cross, every 10 seconds someone
receives a blood transfusion. So a
dwindling supply could have seri-
ous repercussions. V 3

Even if a man has had sex with
another man, he could lie dur-
ing the screening before donat-
ing blood that asks about sexual
history. In that sense, the ban can

' already be easily circumvented.

But rather than ostracizing an
entire group, the pre-screening

. should instead ask if the male do-

nator has had unprotected sex with
another man. ’ ‘

All sexual behavior, regardless
of orientation, carries real risks,
and to limit based only on partner
type hampers uninfected donors.
Although HIV infection rates are
high among gays, homosexual men
are far from exclusive carriers of
the disease. A

Too cool for school

Ahmed argues that procrastination is good for your image

Abdul- Kareem Ahmed
-. Columnist

   

From our earliest days of elemen-
tary school, we have been told to
ﬁnish our homework and chores
before a given deadline. Our so-
ciety has an on-the-run attitude,
which adds reason for us to ad-
here to schedules. In some ways,
we have become a slave of our
own invention — time.

In school, we are told of the
horrors of procrastination and
how to avoid falling victim to
them. There are many tips and
tricks to increase our output and
stay competitive. Before you start

"following those guidelines and

pit yourself against procrastina-
tion, th_ink. Is procrastination

always as bad as it is made out

to be?

No, and I’ll even argue that
procrastination can be cool —
yes, cool —— and has its place in
a college experience.

People tend to admire extreme
sports and achievements of dif-
ficult feats, and I bet there are

many unproclaimed adrenaline
junkies out there. Well, we can
shift this attitude to our school
work too. That’s right. We can get
academically extreme. And while
I suppose it’s extreme to take on
seven-course semesters, there’s a
simpler method: procrastinate.

The main rule is, of course,
to restrict your time on an as-
signment. Think about it. Which
sounds cooler: I worked on an
essay 30 minutes a day for two
weeks. I made sure to leave little
rainbow-colored stickies where
I thought I needed more work. I
revised, re—revised and had two
friends check it over for me. I got
an A. Or, I started that essay two
hours before deadline, cranked
it out and aced it.

Of course the latter sounds
cooler. Notice, though, that per-
forming well is a prerequisite for
procrastination to be cool. Do-
ing an assignment in your head
ﬁve minutes before class is not
appreciable if it garners you a
lousy score. So don’t take just any
procrastination to heart.

Regardless, that time extrem-
ism is admirable.

Secondly, procrastination
tests you in a new way. You must
be able to work under pressure,
and that is a feat that could take
some getting used to. I guess

it’s another way to differentiate I

students by skill. Don’t get me
wrong: It is not a disadvantage
to buckle under time pressure. It
just means you should probably
pursue a career accordingly.

When you are looking for a
job that’s fast paced and pressur-
izing, your procrastination skills
will come in handy.

From a sales representative
who must make X number of deals
by noon to the surgeon who must
race the clock to keep a patient
alive, being able to work against
time is a necessary trait. You’re
not always going to get the time
to neatly plan everything out on
a calendar, and need I bring up
the stickies again?

Your spontaneity and present

energy will help you past time
crunches. There is no better place
to learn these skills than through
procrastination in college.

Watch and learn with Kahn on YouTube

Online lectures save time and money for students in Third World countries and could help educate people from home.

Steve Kaszycki
For The Pitt News

    
 

Pitt’s classes could have some
competition — from a man who
records videos in his closet.
Sounds unbelievable, but it’s
true. '

The Khan Academy — run
by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology-educated Salman
Khan, a former ﬁnancial analyst
— offers a range of tutorial and
educational videos on YouTube.
Most run around 10 minutes and
cover a variety of subjects with
an emphasis on mathematics and
natural sciences. Unless viewers
decide to use YouTube’s 9'9-cent

download "feature, the videos are ,

free.

So maybe Khan’s innovative
system won’t run Pitt, or any
colleges, out of business any-
time soon, but his approach to
education could be the start of
something big.

Khan started inauspiciously.
His first tutoring gig was for a
cousin struggling with unit con-
version in her seventh grade

math class.

Upon her success, several
other cousins came calling. Be-
cause live sessions were imprac-
tical, Khan posted material on
YouTube and soon discovered
that others had stumbled on his
work, so he began expanding the
offerings. -

Several years later, Khan has
more than a thousand videos
online. He narrates all of them,
though others have undertaken
the task of translating them into
other languages.

Along with a variety of math
subjects, ranging from the most
basic of subjects -— 1 + 1, literally
—— to differential equations and
advanced calculus ‘topics, Khan
has videos on biology, chemistry
andhistory.

-He’s recorded them in a con-
verted closet in his house using
basic equipment. The videos con-
sist primarily of his writing and
drawing, with his disembodied
voice providing narration.

Although Khan uses modern
technology, the presentation is
in some ways a throwback — no
streaming video, fancy graphics

i or animated bills singing about

becoming laws.

Some universities have under-
taken initiatives to make course
material available online, mostly
through YouTube and iTunes.

Several schools have posted
entire lecture series from popu-
lar courses. Web users can, for
instance, watch renowned MIT
math professor Gilbert Strang
lecture on linear algebra, or lis-
ten to Peter Millican lecture on
philosophy.

Most of the videos preserve
the characteristic" of the tradi-

e tional university class. The pro-

fessor stands in front of a chalk-
board and spends anywhere from
half an hour to more than an hour

. on a given topic.

Sometimes universities face
the constraints of dealing with
copyrighted materials that can
be used in class but whose usage
cannot be extended to the online
versions, an issue that can reduce
some lectures _to patchwork.

But except for the handy
pause button, watching the vid-
eos aren’t always much different
than attending class. _

Khan initially kept videos to
around 10 minutes out of neces-
sity — the limit that YouTube im-
poses. But he has persisted with
the format because of what he
sees as the beneﬁt of the shorter
running time. It suits the audi-
ence’s shorter attention span.

If you have trouble staying
awake for a 50-minute lecture
on integrals, Khan’s platform
is a solution. Spend 10 minutes
following a concentrated lecture‘
and then go off and practice what
you learned.

Khan will expand a feature on
his home page that allows learn-
ers to try their hand at interactive
math problems.

Khanis initiative is likely to
supplement, rather than replace,

_ traditional educational institu-

tions in the United States, but it
might have a more pronounced
role in the developing world,
where the educational infrastruc-
ture isn’t nearly as developed.
Khan’s videos have already
debuted in Ethiopia. The poten-
tial beneﬁt, in light of efforts to
provide children in developing
nations with low-cost laptops,

could be massive in the coming
years. .

_ The Khan Academy isan in-
teresting step in a new direction,
both in terms of Internet tech-
nology usage and educational
philosophy. v_ .

While many other YouTube
users upload instructional ma-
terial from guitar lessons to tips
on languages, Khan’s videos will
likely become the largest and_
most systematic attempt to use
the popular video—sharing site to
provide a full educational experi-
ence. There’s no for-charge prod-
uct tie-in or tuition bill, either.

A free education tool that’s
accessible and to-the-point
sounds like a winning formula.
But whether colleges would adopt
a system that enhances — or re-

s places — the lecturing professor

remains to be seen. We’ll have to
keep watching. ~

it is a way to assess your limits. I know
you’re anxious, but before you prove your
extreme-ness, take a practice test, so to
speak. Time yourself and write that big
paper or ﬁnish that chapter of homework.
Did you meet your goal? Was the paper
shoddy, the homework’s answers incor-
rect? Remember, proper procrastination
is a learned skill.

When writing that essay in three hours,
you can only type so fast, but you’re also
limited by how fast you can think of

ﬂowing ideas. Or when ﬁnishing phys-
ics homework, you learn how far" your
mathematical shortcuts and calculator
tricks will take you.

Know your limits so you can plan ac-
cordingly, especially in college. When se-
lecting your course schedule, you’ll know
how much work you can complete every
day, once you’ve built up that time pres-
sure. Therefore, you can better know how
many credits to take and which courses
will be most suitable.

But not all procrastination is good.
We’re not all meant to live on the edge.
Waiting on an assignment and then

-completing it half-heartedly and perform-

ing poorly is never a sound option. Let-
ting assignments hang for weeks so that
the sheer volume of work eclipses your
procrastination prowess is an equally un-
warranted scenario. Procrastination is an
ability worth honing but also one that’s
practiced best with moderation and con-
trol. Controlled procrastination sounds

Learn to procrastinate, live on the edge

oxymoronic, I know, but even the best

procrastinators face limits.

If applied properly, procrastinating can
give you an edge, however counterintui—
tive that might seem. It’s all right. Your
professor won’t know you did it all in an
hour. Hopefully. .

said.

" Though the program hasn’t seen
those sorts of numbers yet this year,
Cook said she is conﬁdent itwill grow

‘FOOD COLUMN’

 

Tofu or not to. fu: an interesting question

Sarah Simkin
Staff Writer

Sure, it might look like nothing
but opaque Jell—O and without ap-
propriate preparation might taste
blander than the paper.-But tofu has
more going for it than you might
think. '

There’s not necessarily a call to
cut out red meat, chicken. or other
protein sources that might have
formerly had faces ‘and made en-

dearing noises unless religious or C

moral reasons compel you to do
so. 4

But non-meat sources of protein
can be healthier, more convenient

and even cost effective. There’s a
reason that tofu has been in con-
tinuous culinary usage since the
Han dynasty of ancient China. _
Low in calories and fat and high
in iron, calcium and protein, tofu is
no longer an obscure or difﬁcult—to—
ﬁnd food item and is certainly no
longer just for die-hard vegetar-

ians and their sinister zealot cousin '

vegans.

Yes, it’s available at organic
foodie meccas like Whole Foods
and Trader_]oe’s, but you can also
ﬁnd it at Giant Eagle and IGA, as
well. '

Toﬁi is made-by pressing the
curds ‘of coagulating soy milk into
blocks, which might not sound ter-

riﬁcally appetizing, but it pales in

grossness comparison to the ,pro- '

cesses of many snack foods we scarf
down every day. Don’t tell me you
thought Easy Mac got to. be that
shade of orange through any re-
motely natural occurrence.

So why should you consider

ditching that burger or chicken

sandwich for a soy product sub-
stitute?

For starters, you can do nearly
anything with tofu. We’re talking
just about any kitchen—related
verb: Pan-sear it, grill it, sauté it
in teriyaki sauce for a delicious and
healthy addition to stir-fry — or
stop by 360° in Market Central to
have it done for you — toss it into

a blender for a protein jolt to any
shake or smoothie, or you can even
bake it into what you might ﬁnd a
surprisingly tasty dessert.

Textured tofus can be used
in “meat” sauces for pastas and
lasagnas or substituted for tuna
in a casserole. Unlike chicken or
red meat, there’s no salmonella or
potential bacteria to worry about.
That is to say you could eat it raw
if you wanted.

So some tofu dishes can require
less cooking and preparation time
making dinner faster and easier.

Soy’s not the only option in the
faux-meat game. Enter seitan, the
toast of the macrobiotic, Buddhist
and vegan cooking communities,

commonly known as wheat meat.

Charming rhyming moniker
aside, this seemingly suspicious
substance can be prepared to mim-
ic a variety of meats, including sub-
stituting for duck when roasted.

With a typical .expiration date
of three weeks after its production,
seitan can stay fresher for a longer
time than meat. Tofu can last even
longer if properly stored, mean-
ing potentially fewer grocery shop-
ping expeditions —- an advantage if
you’re careless and such trips entail
serious schlepping on Port Author-
ity buses.

So if you’re looking for some-
thing new and delicious, look past
the pale blob and consider tofu.

structures already laid out for their read-
ing pleasure.

“True Blood” began its third season on
June 13, which corresponds to the third
novel in “The Southern Vampire Myster-
ies,” called “Club Dead.” For anti-bookies,
Sookie Stackhouse is stuck in time and
held back by HBO and summer television
seasons. But Sookie has already lived those
adventures, experienced those loves and
mysteries and met those villains.

Many Sookie Stackhouse novels revolve
around travel, connected to vampire poli-
tics, and establish Sookie’s sense of self
away from the men in her life, her home-
town and friends. By the 10th book, our
heroine has experienced so much that she
feels more conﬁdent. She knows what she
wants and who she wants.

While the novels are mysteries at their
core, most revolve around a romance, or
more likely, a love triangle. Flirting, sexual
tension and Sookie’s inner struggle be-
tween her urges and her southern belle
mentality make for an interesting, often
humorous read. .

ALBUM REVIEW

Makaras Pen out of ink

Shoe-gaze band doesn’t make its mark on the genre

Brendan Cgiticchia
Staﬁ'Wri ter

_ Twenty some years ago, the term “shoe—

gaze” was strictly used to refer to a handful
of bands from the United Kingdom with a
penchant for creating order out of chaos
by fusinggtogether distorted guitar work
andalush soundscapes. A

In 2010, its use seems to have expande
to describe any musical groupthat uti-
lizes an effects pedal and dreamy vocals.
Buffalo-based quintet Makaras Pen, un-
fortunately, falls into this latter category.
Its self-titled release has much more in
common sonically with Evanescence than
My Bloody Valentine.

The album’s opener, “Currents,” is a
case in point. The song begins strongly

‘ enough, with a reverb-laden guitar strum

and vocalist Emma Willis doing her best

Cocteau Twins imitation. 4
However, at about the minute mark,

when the chorus kicks in, the track morphs

into what can only be described as an FM v

radio reject from 2001.

Although not all of Makaras Pen’s 11
tracks fall quite as ﬂat, most of themseem
marred by amateurish production as well.
Otherwise solid songs such as “Falling
Deeper” and “Promises” are the biggest
offenders here, sounding more like they
were mastered with GarageBand than a
professional studio. ‘

The effect of such a sound is that on
the former track, when Willis cries that
“what’s said between us dies within us,” it

money to their teams because it is
fun. Others use it as an outlet. But
by looking deeper, some people ﬁnd
that sports often mirror life — tri-
umph, tragedy, hope and despair can
all be seen throughout the season
in every sport. Nearly everything
ﬂin sports can be translated into a
"life lesson.

The story of David and Goliath
might be a biblical tale, but it is more
likely to be referenced on ESPN than
in church. There is perhaps no other
city where sports are more ingrained

"z«:into everyday life than Pittsburgh.

DeLuca’s Steelers room is not
large, but there are more towels,
ticket stubs, ﬁgurines and other
keepsakes to ﬁll an entire aisle in a
Wal—Mart Supercenter -—— though he

‘ would never sell any of it.

“It’s just ﬁm,” he said. “I get a kick
out of seeing people’s reactions.”

DeLuca, a few family members
and some friends from church gath-
er in the room to watch away games.
Nobody drinks alcohol there.

"*5 “It’s a safe place to come and
watch the games,” he said.

The seed for his collecting hobby
was planted inthe 1970s as the Steel-
ers started winning Super Bowls.

His dad owned a restaurant in the
Strip District, DeLuca’s, and every
time the Steelers won a champion-
ship, he would get one of the collect-
ible Super Bowl glasses.

He kept them aside over the
years, and in the 1990s — when
the Steelers re-emerged as playoff
contenders —— he set them on top
of the TV.

Over the years, he kept all of the
stubs from his season tickets, and he
would buy smallfootball ﬁgurines at
ﬂea markets. He used his knack for

crafts and painted the ﬁgurines to

resemble Steelers players and placed
them in his room in the basement.

He never buys anything from a
store for his room, and every item
has a story behind it.

At Three Rivers Stadium, DeLuca
would sit in section 617. When his
kids were little and they had to use
the restroom behind 617, they would
run all the way down to the last stall
to go the bathroom so nobody could

hear them... ,

The toilet seat from that stall is
now hanginginhis basement with a
Cleveland Browns sign and fake dog
droppings attached.

But that’s not the only thing The ,

salvaged from Three Rivers. A steel
beam from the stadium sits at the
base, of the TV stand. _

Denny DeLuca: ,

catwalk every time someone scored

- an important touchdown or did

something else noteworthy. Before

the stadium was imploded, he asked

some of the workers to go cut that
beam out for him.

They did. But they didn’t wear a

V maskwhile doing so, and they were

ﬁned. The incident was chronicled

It’s just fun. The people  
here don’ t make excuses for
themselves or for the team.

On the 50-yard line ofThree Riv-
ers Stadium, a catwalk was erected
and seats were removed to accom-
modate television cameras. DeLuca
would rarely sit in his own seats, be-
cause they would always move to
the 50-yard line to stand under the
catwalk for a better view.‘

During games, they would write
on the steel beam supporting the

 

in the Post-Gazette, and the article
is framed and sitting on top of the
~ beam. 1

The beam might be the most
noteworthy item in the room, but
it’s not DeLuca’s favorite.

“That is my most prized posses-
sion,” he said, pointing to a black,
rotten old pickle. '

“At one of the games at Three

Rivers, my son threw a pickle from
a burger at the wall, and it stuc ,”
he said. “The weeks went by, and
nobody removed it. Finally, at the
last game, we took it and put it in a
bag to keep in the room.”

The bagged pickle is tacked onto
the shelf above the TV and hangs
just above the top right corner of

the screen;

However, all of these storied
keepsakes are difﬁcult to ﬁnd upon
ﬁrst glance. The room is a potpourri
of black and gold.

There are several large stadium
parking signs, footballs found in the
parking lots the day after tailgates,
special Coke bottles commemorat-
ing the ﬁrst game at Heinz Field —

they were misprinted because the ‘

game was postponed because of the
terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, a small
Cleveland Browns handmade trophy
case -—— which, of course, is empty —
a mud-stained “Go Browns” towel
with toilet paper hanging from it, six
handmade Lombardi Trophies, ﬁrst
down markers from Three Rivers, a
pin from Super Bowl XLIII that Dan

Everything in room has a story behind it

Steelers 4 10

Rooney gave to him at Rico's Restaurant, a life-
size Troy Polamalu dummy made from a man-
nequin hanging from the ceiling. There is also
a tumstile at the door to the room that came
from Kennywood’s Jackrabbit rollercoaster,
which he decorated in "Steelers logos.

That is only a small percentage of what the
room actually contains.

. Still, DeLuca said he doesn’t think of the
room as just a place to store his memorabilia.
DeLuca, his daughter Jamie, son-in-law Dan
and three friends from his church, Amy, How-
ard and Jim, watch every away game in the
room. Everyone has their own designated seat .

' and their own role.

Six Superman ﬁgurines sit onashelfabove
the TV to represent them. DeLuca painted
them black and gold and personalized them
for each of his friendswho watch the games
with him.

There is a cowbell hanging from the ceiling,
which commemorates Jerome Bettis. During
his playing days,Jamie would shout, “Run you
big cow!” every time he got the ball. They would
ring that cowbell every time Bettis scored a
touchdown.

Dan said he isn’t particularly fond of Ben
Roethlisberger. So DeLuca rigged up a Roethlis-
berger ﬁgurine with ﬁshing wire to hang from
the chandelier — made of Steelers 75th An-
niversary cups. When Roethlisberger throws

a touchdown, DeLuca lifts up a weight that sits
by his chair and the ﬁgurine dangles in front
of the TV to taunt Dan.

DeLuca, however, said he doesn’t live and
die by wins or losses, and he didn’t take this
season’s disappointment to heart.

“The Steelers have been so fortunate over
the years. Yeah, we’re bummed out when they
lose, but my mind looks forward to next wee ,”
he said. “It’s a game, and you can’t win them
all.” V .

He created the room simply for fun, and he
feels a sense of family in it also. Members of
his church will often leave Steelers items on his
porch, and nobody will tell him who did it.

DeLuca and his room were proﬁled in the
Post-Gazette recently, and one person who
read the story called him and left a message.

“You should be ashamed of yourself for
worshiping those overpaid crybaby athletes,”
the message said.

DeLuca wasn’t bothered.

“It’s just ﬁm,” he said. “The people here
don’t make excuses for themselves or for the
team. They want to win, but they understand
the game. Football relates to life. Every job A
everybody does is like a big game. There are
tasks to do and a lot of work to achieve the
desired resul .”

The same goes for his Steelers room.

Fans watch the USA vs. England World Cup gameat the Vietnam Veteran’s Pavilion in
A Schenley Park on Saturday. The game ended in a draw.

Men’s basketball to
play in new arena

Will play Tennessee in the Big East/ SEC Invitational

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team will play
in its ﬁrst ever SEC/Big East Basketball
Invitational this year —— and will do so
in style.

Pitt will play Tennessee in the new Con-
sol Energy Center Downtown as part of a
doubleheader on Dec. 11.

“This is a great event for the city of

Pittsburgh,” head coachjamie Dixon said ‘

in a press release. “With our terriﬁc fan
support and opening of the new Consol
Energy Center, it’s easy to see why Pitts-
burgh was selected to host this outstand-
ing event.”

This is the fourth year of the Invita-
tional in which two teams from each con-

ference are selected to participate. The
Volunteers are coming off an Elite Eight
appearance, whereas the Panthers bowed
out in the second round.

The arena will officially open Aug. 18
with a Paul McCartney concert, and it is
also set to host the first and second rounds
of the 2012 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tour-
nament. ,

The times have not been announced
yet for the doubleheader, which includes
Rutgers and Auburn in the first game, but
the games will be televised on ESPN and
ESPN2. -

“We’re honored to be chosen to host
such a high-profile major college basket-
ball event in our ﬁrst season of opera-
tion,” general manager of Consol Energy
Center/SMGJay Roberts said in the press
release.
