The -speakers have stressed the fact
that in supporting a Pitt man on th

the University’ not only does a piece
of worth while work from the stand-

also identiﬁes‘ itself closely with

In sending Henry Frank to Can-

to give him the assurance that he is
backed by the entire student ‘body and

 .What is the matter with having the
‘student body as a; Whaler join in the
singing of Alma Mater at assem'blies
’an,dL_ student gatherings? .Of latethe
custom seems to have grown up of
having ‘A»1ma’M.a.terL rushed" through by‘
the"L(}1eeClu1b or  other organiza-
tion in place of the pinging -by the
entire -Btu-(lent body Lwhicli is the prop-
er and the ;natura1.Lco1L1rseL-to tollow.

. Alma Mater ‘should be given a reg-
ular place on every assembly program
and should be joined in by everyone.
The hymn was originally devised, we
believe, as ‘a means of expression
whereby the student body of the Uni- A
versity might Lvoice its loyalty to the
ins—titu»tio~n, and certainly that end is
not reached by making an exhibition
number out of_Alma Mater at every
gathering of the students. 'There”'is
nothing more imlplressivec than the sing-
ing of Pitt’s Alma. Mater, with its:ris-
ing tones and measured volume, when
three thousand students join in the
song. Let’s sing it,-tnot listen to it,_
and see that hereafter those in charge
of programs at public student gather-
ings secure for it the pro~p'er place of}
dignity to which it is entitled. L

- vidual, but more especially of the community in_

which he belongs.”

Life insurance is inscparably bound up with the
prosperity of every individual, family and community.
It is a secure and prosperous business and satisfactory
to the salesman in every way.

The JOHN HANCOCK would like to interest a few
ambitious men who graduate this year to make JOHN
HANCOCK selling their life work.

Statistics on college graduates who have éhtered
life insurance place it at the very top as a source of
-jncorne. Before making a decision as to yotir career
it would be well to make inquiries of the “Agency
Department.”

Andre Kerr, who has coached the

Both the varsity, and Freshman
track teams ‘haveib-ig merets-‘this. ‘Sat-

with the varsity in importance. «The
Cubs go to Penn State folja. dual. with
the Nittany yearlings, while the var

the Army. . ~ N -

Little is known of the strength of‘?
‘either , opponent, although Pitt's
chances in both meets are thought
to be good. The Army never goes into
track ex-tensivel:y;, but always produces
an array of ,talent. notwithsitand=ing..
The same may be said for the State‘
Freshmen. An elaborate ‘schedule for
a. Freshman team is impossible, but
fa.=ci.lit.ies are so inducive» to-track work,
atlstate that their ﬁrst-year team may -

The varsity will‘ line up against’

meets to « date. It is dou»bti‘ul if the
Freshman will take at large team’ to
‘State, most of the members being
characterized for" their versatility and
a squad of but eight. men could very
easily enable the Freshmen to ’put
strong entrants in every event. “Grip”
Sauer, for example, can ‘compete in
the hurdles" and in every ﬁeld ‘event,
in addition. The same thing is prac-
tically true of N» Marsh Johnson. Both
are all-round performers of the ﬁr-st
order. Biruder will be the ones’ best
bet in the ssprints, with Fralich, Riley,
Corbett, and Wadkins running the dis-
tances. ‘Sturgeon can be counted on
for a number of points in the hurdles
and jumps. The other men to make N

this season. The Cubs have two at-

they have been,‘ so far, opposed to
teams who. offered little resistance.
But this coming week promises some-
thing different.  V’ 11 Tuesday the

  Game With

Our baseball team traveled to
Grove City last Saturday and lost to
the‘/Qollege nine-,VVo:l;' that town in a
.4-3”battle, -the second -game our team
lost to Grove Cily In eight days. As
was case in the first Grove City game,
iwhicl-. lasted ten innings, this game
was replete with thrills and excite-
ment. We lost‘ out in the ninth,in-
Vning when the home team scored the
winning? run one a safe bunt, an error,
and a single with only one out.

4 It wasa hard game forour repre-
sentatives to lose. we pl , d as well *
as our opponents, but errors at in-
opportune timesi by us gave Groye
City a couple of runs that helped con-
siderably in defeating us. Neverthe-
less, our conquerors should be accred- T
ited with _ having earned a well’ de-
served victory, for they producdd
their own breaks and tookilladvantagel
of them. .  6

We began. thegamel as if we were
going to get revenge for that ten-
-inning »game that we lost tpthem on
Tziees Field. Hollerun led ioif by
drawing a P base on balls. Tommy»
/went to second: on Hill’-5 inﬁeld out
‘and scored on: Davi6es’s two-base hit."

inning after two were out. With» on
down, Smith singled, ;reniain3 6 B

City went into the lead» in the 
inning by scoringa. run. With  ” "
hamian on first, Smith singled an , ‘d _,

fWillia.mtson in an effort to ﬁnd
a reliable substitute has unearthed a*
real find in Lytle pf Aslpﬁnwall I-Iigh;
Coach Williamson has been more than
gsatisﬁed with his work during the pre-
vious week. _ V B A A
One of the prominent factors of the
team work has been the " brilliant
showing which has been made by Bru-
‘der during the last two weeks. This
‘boy seems -to be. a‘. natural luminary
in whatever he chooses to take up.
He has been playing a bang-up game
lately, his hitting being especially im- «
pressive». He is a powerful hitter, and
bats with equal fa‘cil‘ityi with either
hand.
