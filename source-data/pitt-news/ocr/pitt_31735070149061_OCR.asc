MEN’S BASKETBALL
After slow
start, Pitt

dominates

,RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

During a media timeout in the ﬁrst
half ofwednesday night’s City Game,
a Pitt student correctly answered a

- trivia question askinginwhat year the

ﬁrst men’s basketball game between
Pittsburgh’s two biggest schools was
played;

The answer was 1932, and that I

game, played at the Pitt Pavilion
80 years’ ago, ﬁnished in favor of
Duquesne, 28-21.

Early on at the Consol Energy
Center Wednesday, it appeared the
2012 edition of the historic ‘match-
up might be almost as low—scoring
as that inaugural game. But the Pan-
thers (8-1) eventually found their
scoringtouch and pulled away towin
their 12th straight City Game over

- Duquesne, 66-45.

The early stages of the game were
plagued by missed shots, fouls and
turnovers, as neither the Panthers
nor the Dukes could establish an of-
fensive ﬂow.

The teams couldn’t even take ad-
vantage of their free throws, shooting
a combined 5-for—10 from the charity

stripe. .

With points hard to come by, the
difference in the ﬁrst half was Pitt’s
Steven Adams and Tray Woodall-.
Adams set a career high in rebounds

with 14, 11 of which were in the ﬁrst

half alone, and Woodall’s same num-
ber of points gave the Panthers a29—17
lead after a sloppy ﬁrst period.
Head coach Jamie Dixon spoke
about Adams’ improved perfor-

mance.

Stolen artwork leaves art students, professors perplexed

Lauren Bauschard
Staff Wrz'ter

Recent thefts at the Frick Fine Arts
Building have Pitt students and in-
structors alike crossing their ﬁngers
in hopes of the safe return of the origi-
nal artwork_.

Delanie Jenkins, the chair and
associate professor of the Depart-
ment of Studio Arts, said that over
Thanksgiving break, several pieces

*-of student artwork were stolen from

basement hallways of the Frick Fine
Arts Building, where many studio
arts facultyexhibit works from their
courses. , i .
The thefts took‘ place over the ﬁve-
day Thanksgiving holiday late last
month when many University build-
ings were closed. However, Jenkins
said that because many students stay
in town over the h

. . A

oliday and like to

       

i work on the weekend, the studios at Q

Frick were supposed to be open on
Saturday and Sunday for students
wanting to work. The building was

supposed to be locked on Nov. 22 and i

23, the Thursday and Friday ofbreak,

‘ according toJenkins. \

Yet when a student went to Frick

.Fine Arts on Saturday, the ‘student
noticed a print was missing from '

one of the basement halls. The studio
arts department later learned that
an ofﬁcer who usually does security
rounds reported that the buildingwas
unlocked Friday evening.

Jenkins realized Monday, Nov. 26,
that two other works hadbeen stolen
from another class. At th°e close of
Tuesday classes, it was conﬁrmed
that the artists had taken none of the

pieces home and that three pieces

total from the studio arts depart-

ment had ‘been stolen. According to

Jenkins, each time additional pieces
were discovered missing, a faculty
member assisted the student artists

_in contacting Pitt police. _
Jenkins declined to share the

names of the artists whose pieces
were stolen, adding that she did not
think it would help the case if the art-
ists were recognized.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele, who
handled questions on behalf of the
Pit police, did not wish to disclose

any changes to‘ building security"

-measures as a result of the thefts or
information regarding the current
state of the investigation.

. Studio arts student Theresa
Baughman said that because of the
artwork disappearances, she is a little
worried about her pieces being sto-
len, although she is more concerned
about her art supplies being taken.
However, Paughman said she has

.1» Sara/rw.maggieanclstaiiasgifts.c_r;m

noticed an increase in security mea-
sures the past week since Thanksgiv-
ing break.

.“I’ve seen more officers patrol
and ask us what we are doing here,”
she said. “That kind of makes me feel
better.” ,

This isn’t the ﬁrst time the stu-
dio arts department has experienced
theft, according to bothjenkins and
Baughman. ..

According to Jenkins, a similar
situation happened last year when a
painting was stolen. The studio arts
department released a ﬂyer offering

the thief an opportunity to return the -

painting to an anonymous unlocked
locker, a strategy the department will

— try again this year.

turned and placed in the locker .'.. No

Corbett provides sparkitonewgindustry drive

Len Boselovic
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
(M CT Campus)

Gov. Tom Corbettﬁon Tuesday doled out a
portion of Pennsylvania’s $5 million con-
tribution to a $70 million public-private
partnership that government and industry
ofﬁcials hope will spark a manufacturing
renaissance in the state.

Corbett said two Pittsburgh companies
and one in Bucks County will get state funds
to hire graduate students from Carnegie
Mellon University and Lehigh University to
help the companies with projects involving
additive manufacturing, a technology that
is expected to revolutionize manufacturing.

He made the announcement at Acu-
tronic, a Washington’s Landing aerospace
industry supplier that was one of the grant
winners. The other two companies are Ex-
One of Irwin and Paramount Industries of
Langhorne.

The value of the grants was not disclosed.
CMU mechanical engineering professor 0.

Burak Ozdoganlar said each dollar from the
state will be matched with $1.50 from the
three companies and willfund a graduate
student’s work for one year. The company
contributions could comein the form of
providing employees to work on the proj-
ects, he said.

Each of the projects involves additive
manufacturing. Also known as 3-D print-
ing, the technology has been hailed as the
harbinger of the next industrial revolution
and the next trillion-dollar industry.

Additive manufacturing enables com-
panies to make ﬁnished complex products
without bending, molding, welding, grind-

ing and assembling various components. A '

digital image of the product is sliced into
hundreds or thousands of layers the width
of a human hair. ,

l A 3-D printer similar to a laser-jet printer
sprays layersof powdered metals or other
materials and sand into a box, binding them
together with a proprietary liquid. Once
each layer is printed, the sand is vacuumed
away, and the ﬁnished part is hardened in

a furnace.

The state’s commitment of $5 million in
$1 million installments helped a consortium
of businesses and universities in Pennsylva-
nia, northeast Ohio and West Virginia win
$30 million in federal funding to start the
National Additive Manufacturing Innovation 5
Institute. Companies, universities and gov-
ernments will provide the other $40 million.

Ozdoganlar estimated that $1 million.
in state funds could support 12 to 15 in-;:

ternships at CMU and Lehigh, the schools’ T

Corbett selected for the program injune. 1
The institute, based in Youngstown,
Ohio, is«—one of 15 manufacturing institutes

proposed by President Barack Obama as_-.
part of his strategy to revitalize manufac- ~

turing. .

Morris University and Penn State University

ing initiative. Companies supporting the
effortinclude Allegheny Technologies, aff

questions asked,”Jenkins said.
Baughman said she’s heard of other students
who have had their supplies stolén more re-
cently. .

But besides the beauty of the work, Baugh-
man said, she doesn’t understand what the mo-
tive _of the theft of the pieces of art could be,
especially if they were taken by another student.
As a studio arts student, Baughman says she
understands the long hours and dedication that
goes into each work, and she said that to steal
the ﬁnished products seems cruel.

Jenkins noted that the department informs
the students before puttingtheirwork on display
that there is a risk of theft and that faculty are the
only people authorized to hang and remove work
in the hallways. But despite the risk involved,
Jenkins said she believes that the art displays
are a crucial part of the educational experience
for aspiring art students at Pitt.

“Exhibiting the artwork of students is inte-

' gral to the practice of our discipline,” she said.
“It generates ‘discussion among students, among

student’s andacourse’s progress within our cur-
riculum anddepartment goals.”

Jenkins said she has discussed the idea of
adding display cases, which might solve the
problem of theft, but she believes they would
limit the ﬂexibility and a student’s broad think-
ingfor projects. «

Pitt usually celebrates rank-
ings published by institutions
like The Princeton Review or
US News and World Report.
An.d rightly so. In categories ‘
as obscure as “health services,”
“percentage of seniors gradu-
ating with internship experi-
ence” and “happiest campus,”
Pitt finds itself near the top.

But a recent survey of ethnic
diversity at national universi-
ties is raising some concern
around campus. “According to
US News and World Report —
whose widely read lists we typi-
cally ﬂaunt with pride — Pitt
has a diversity problem.

According to US News’ di-
versity index, which measures
“where students are most likely
to encounter undergraduates
from racial or ethnic groups
different from their own,” Pitt
has a low score relative to its
overall ranking.

The low score is not neces-
Vsarilyindicative of a flawed
Office of Admissions —

Pitt’s minority enrollment is almost per-
fectly proportional to the state’s minority

population. According to the census, ra- '

cial minorities make up 22 percent of the
Pennsylvania population and 22 percent
of the University’s sophomore class —
thefall 2011 undergraduate proﬁle was
the most recently available data. The Of-
ﬁce of Admissions is successfully doing
its job to recruit, admit and enroll minor-
ity students at rates consistent with the
general population.

Or soit would appear. _

But the census is missing an important
population: undocumented immigrants.
Because the majority of undocument-
ed immigrants are Hispanic, Hispanic
people are underrepresented in the U.S.
census. Therefore 4 even though Pitt has

- an otherwise impressive record regardirlg
minority enrollment -—- the"n“unib_'er_ of

Hispanic students will be disproportion-
ately low relative to the actual number

of.Hispanic people in Pennsylvania for
as long as Pitt’s demographics mirror
census data. I

Only 1.79 percent of the Pitt under-
graduate community is Hispanic. Un-
doubtedly, the low number of Hispanic
Pitt students in a country where, 16 per-

cent§of the population is Hispanic helps "

explain why Pitt scored so poorly on the
diversity index.

One_effective way of increasing the
population of Hispanic students at Pitt
— and also at Penn State, which fared
similarly in the report —— would be for the
state legislature to allow undocumented
immigrants access to in-state tuition if
they have graduated from a Pennsylvania

high school and havebelen accepted to_[ .-

the University. Currently,'undocum‘ent-ed

immigrants can attend public universi-7

ties such as Pitt, but have to payftuition
at out-of-state rates,‘ _ H" 

  :'I‘he ‘plan is nsotvasioutlandish as it 

 

o

“attendance and graduation from a state
high school and acceptable college admis-
sion applications.” In states as diverse
as Connecticut and Kansas, students
who have lived in the U.S. for their en-
tire high schoolcareers —— and in many
cases, longer — can go to college with
the classmates they grew up with, at the
same cost. ’

Being an undocumented immigrant
is not synonymous with crime. These
undocumented immigrants are often
children who were brought across the
border by parents looking for a better
future, not unlike the ancestors of many
other ethnic groups in the United States.

s No, they don’t have citizenship, but most
undocumented immigrants probably plan

to be in the United States on a long-term

for permanent basis.

By limiting in-state tuition to students

‘who have attended a Pennsylvania high
«:{school, legislators wouldabe ensuring
that these students have contributed to '

the state. Just like the 70 percent of Pitt

students who grew up in Pennsylvania, A

o

with every gallon of gas or trip to the tan-
ning bodth or any other sort of purchase
associated with a tax, undocumented im-
migrants are contributing to the state’s
taxrevenue.

If undocumented immigrants are here
to stay, then they might as well have more
attainable access to higher education
and, while they’re at it, make American
colleges more diverse. Public universi-
ties in Texas and California, the first
two states to allow in—state tuition for
undocumented immigrants, make up 13
of the top 25 schools on the US News list
of diverse campuses.

One of three‘ main goals outlined in our
University’s mission statement is, “edu—
cating diverse students from the region,
the nation, and the world.” If Pitt wants
to stay true to that goal, then the admin-
istration must work with state politicians
to ensure that the undocumented immi-
grants who have succeeded academically
in our high schools can continue their
education at our Universityl

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor, . .
I am writing in tears ‘about my country, which I do not recognize anymore.

The Egyptian Arabic spring has been typically a North African season blown by desert— _

dry hot winds carryingtons of fogging sand and dust. As summer strikes after, Egyptians

optimistically hoped democracy, human rights and'law enforcement to be just around

the corner. ~ ’ . p
-when Islamists took power, people naively remained optimistic and trustful. Could

‘ we have been more mistaken? Where ‘on earth has a religious democratic authority that

considers human rights existed‘? It is an oxymoron like a cold ﬁre. or a cubic ball. Now
that the Islamist president removed all masks after banning all challenges to unilaterally
passing an Islamist constitution (those who vote “yes” on the Dec. 15 referendum will be
granted an oil bottle, arice packet plus a guaranteed spot in heaven), the White House is
expressing “c’oncern”! V - _ ' '

In my perplexed emotions where love still outweighs fear, I amnot sure whether to sup-
port the cessation of U.S. funds (1.5 billion per year from your and my taxes) to Egypt to be
used for the harassment of myown Christian family under this constitution or to appeal
for a continuous support for the sake of my people, even the ones with volatile boundaries
between disagreement and hate. The one thi.ngI am sure of is that you may express more
than a concern-... until we reach our summer one day down the road of history.

Tothe Editor,

In her Nov. 30 letter, Lorraine Keeler wrote in support of an “emphasis on programs
that will help me build a better resume and reach the level where I can make an impact in

’ my ﬁeld.” I do not believe that programs devoted to or participated in with the intent of

improving her resume will grant her, or any other similarly driven individual, the great-
est chance of progressing in any ﬁeld. Research and innovation, the sources of progress,
require perseverance and creativity, and, above all, must be motivated by some sort of
curiosity or desire to learn more. I do not consider a desire to “build a better resume” to
be particularly good motivation or grounds for future success.

Ms. Keeler’s characterization of the “old” University Honors College’s reading groups,
“niche groups that  were purely for fun,” is rather ignorant and insulting._She assumes‘
that the participants gain nothing substantial. Reading groups are the embodiment of
intellectual curiosity, as they allow interested and dedicated individuals to gather, discuss
and understand topics that they perhaps would never meet in an undergraduate classroom.

Finally, Ms. Keeler will undoubtedly be pleased to learn that students began dialogue
with the UHC long before their Facebook escapades began.

Handmade Arcade

David L. Lawrence Convention Center
Saturday, Dec. 8, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
www.handmadearcade.com ‘

Creating art is ‘not absolute9tn‘_agi_cT

—— there are certain ru_les. To  out?‘ V
sider, this might sound counterin— S
T tuitive. But the world of art pulsates

and swells with the collective breaths
of a group — successful artists are
joiners. Artists are part of historical
periods — romanticism, impression-
ism, surrealism, fauvism — where
paintings, sculptures and writings
explore philosophies, evoke styles
and preach to audiences.

Local artist Tamara Barker, howev- \

er, betrays the norms of the art world_
and ﬁnds refuge in the uncharted.
“-I love the ornate aesthetic of
things that were never meant to be
seen  and bringing images to the
present rather than having them sit
in a landﬁll somewhere. My art helps
people see the beauty hidden in what
they consider trash,” Barker said.
Supporting local artists like Barker
and sharing their innovationwith
the community is a chief goal of the

' Handmade Arcade, the independent

craft fair featuring more than 150 art-
ists from more than 15 different states
that is set for Saturday, Dec. 8, at the
David L. Lawrence Convention Center.

According to event organizerJen—
nifer Baron, the Handmade Arcade
was started in 2004 “by a group of
artists and crafters who felt like there
was a need in Pittsburgh fora market-
placefor indie artists workingvoutside
of the mainstream. ' ” ‘

“We ‘wanted to «make-a» market?

place for artists who use innovative
techniques like upcycling, recycling
and using found objects,” Baron said.
“We have grown from an intimate

gathering of about 35 vendors
and 1,000 people to 150 ven-
dors and are expecting ove
6,000 people.” _ _ '
The event’s growth paral-
lels the increased number
of applicants seeking to be
featured. The organizers of
the Handmade Arcade uti-
lize a rigorous set of criteria
to, sift through their more
than 300 applicants. This
set of criteria sufficiently
defines the “uniqueness”

who are working outside
of the mainstream,” Baron ex-
plained. '_

The vendors are chosen based on
the “quality, craftsmanshipand in-
novativeness” of their work in addi-
tion to whether or not their material
is mass—produced or handmade (the
event is in support of the “buy local’’

and “buy homemade” movements)

Tupac would have had a great Twitter. Fall-
ing somewhere between controversial and
outright inspiring, his tweets would’ve em-
bodied the philosophical ramblings of Lil
B as well as the straight grit of Chief Keef.

That’s blasphemy to plenty of people,
comparing any rapper from the ’90s —— es-
pecially Tupac —— to what purists deem the
“fake rap” of many artists today. But when Lil
B tweeted “You don’t deserve to be in pain, I
love you— Lil B,” his words attracted upward
of 4,000 retweets and more than 10,000
favorites in minutes. His messages, albeit
at times nonsensical, resonate.

It can be argued — and will be —-— that
hip—hop has made the biggest foray into so-
cial networking of any musical genre. Sorry,

but a Kanye West tweet makes the Earth _ C

shake, whereas Ke$ha is lucky to "acquire
a new follower. This, like President Barack
Obama’s re-election, could be explained by
changing demographics in the country. But
that would be missing the point.

Tupac’s presence In the past would have made for entertaining social media commen-

ding board for today’ s hip—hop artists

Instead, we should focus on the fact that
rappers have a lot to say. And modern social
media allows us the opportunity to hear it
in a new way.

The ’90s, the era in which many college-
aged students were born and a time that
people stubbornly refer to as a golden age
of hip-hop, still saw the genre marginalized
by racial boundaries. “Gangsta rap” spoke
to the increasingly volatile circumstances
in America’s urban areas, and when it fi-
nally made its way to the television screen
through MTV, it was watered down and sub-
verted in the same way that Nirvana was.

During that decade, hip—hop became
synonymous with gang violence and anger.
Sociology professors had a field day harken—
ing the burgeoning genre back to pre-Civil
War America and the civil rights movement,
lending the genre even more popularity and
attention. The complexity of Tupac’s home
in Compton, Calif., or hip—hop group UGK’s
in Port Arthur, Texas, isn’t completely il-

Perhaps the biggest hip-hop trend of

2012 was young artists starting to turn

the corner.

Even with rappers such as Wiz Khalifa
waiting until the last few weeks of 2012
to release their latest work, it has been
an incredible year for hip—hop. Releases
ranged from solid albums by veterans of
the industry, including Nas, to breakout
albums by the likes of Kendrick Lamar.
The barely existent line between main-
stream and indie hip-hop was blurred
further when Killer Mike brought on El-P
— a sworn enemy of major record labels
—— to produce R/LP. Mnrie, one of the
mostwidely praised albums of the year.

Political frustration abounded in the
hip—hop world throughout 2012. Kend-
rick Lamar openly advocated his decision
not to vote in_the presidential election.

» Brother Ali, a friend of the Occupy move-

ment, released Monrning In America and
Dreaming In Color, whereas his label mate
P.O.S. preferred having “a couple of bricks
to occupy [his] backpack.”
Keeping all of that in mind, here is
WPTS? .top three hip—hop albums of 2012.

Released Oct. 22, this phenomenal

sophomore album launched the newest
star from Compton, Calif., onto the main

stage. Although Seetz'on.80, his ﬁrst re-

lease, launched Lamar onto the scene
a year ago, his latest album achieved a
high level of critical success as well as
recognition from the loyal fan base he has
built through his mixtapes and concerts
across the country. This acclaim resulted

‘ in 242,000 record sales in the album’s

first week. V

Fans of hip—hop will note the multiple
personalities Lamar presents in his music
—— similar to those of Notorious B.I.G.

7 on his track “Gimme the Loot” “ along

with his ability to tell a story with a com-
parable level of skill." From the honesty
portrayed in his radio hit “Swimming
Pools (Drank),” in which Lamar discusses
his attempts to stay out of trouble despite
the harsh environment in which he was
raised, to the more raw, in—your—face rap
style displayed in “Backseat Freestyle,”
Lamar’s versatility is just-one of many
reasons he leads this list.

Frank Ocean’s rise to fame has been
an interesting one. As part of the Odd
Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All collec-
tive that formed in Los~Angeles‘over the
past few years,'Frank Ocean’s laid-back,
nearly R&B style felt out of place when
compared to the shocking style of fellow
OFWGKTA rapper Tyler, The Creator.

Breaking away from his crew for this
solo project allowed :-Ocean to find his
signature style and also earned him a
deal with Def Jam Recordings. Oh, and

did we mention this is his debut album?

Frank Ocean is just one of many artists who stirred up 2012 with his music. MCT Campus

Hip-hop superstars Pharrell and Andre

nearly overshadowed when Ocean came

Tracks like “Thinking About You” aren’t

deny Frank Ocean’s lyrical ability, which

lustrated in “Hit ’Em Up” or “Pocket Full Of
Stones,” yet these songs became anthems to
outsiders who weren’t directly exposed to
the respective regions.

Now we have Twitter, Facebook, Insta-
gram, Social Cam and Tumblr, which are all
easy ways for listeners to provide commen-
tary and receive feedback from the artists
without the academic critique that coincided
with the times before social media. These
platforms allow artists to speak as people,
and the gritty bravado displayed in Chief
Keef’s “Love Sosa”_video can be tapered by
tweets about him missing his ex. Hashtag

Annoyingly dogmatic hip—hop fans seem
to forget Tupac’s acting career or how down-
right funny a guy he was. In a 1992 interview
on the Arsenio Hall Show, he talked about
getting to make out withjanetjackson for the
ﬁlm “Poeticjustice.” His animated descrip-
tion of kissingjackson while her boyfriend
looked on makes you wish he had a Twitter,
or at least an active Facebook.

It’s hard to watch an old Tupac or Biggie
interview without getting the feeling that it
could have lasted forever. These were people
who lived in ignored parts of cities and were
from families with less—than-present parents
—— they were hungry for attention in a wholly
justiﬁed sense.

-What better place than the Internet to
ﬁnd that attention?

That isn’t to, say that socioeconomic
marginalization is the only prerequisite to
becoming a rapper. Suburban, Florida-born
Kitty Pryde might not have experienced the
gritty upbringing of her hip—hop colleagues
—— arid, yes, I consider them her colleagues
— but her persona still comes from a once-
ignored place, even if that place is a suburban
teen bedroom.

Truly, we can learn about where the world
is through rap twitter. Heems, one—third of
the now-defunct Das Racist, went on a short
tirade on Tumblr about the United States’
use of drones in Pakistan; Tylerthe Creator
chimed in on Election Day, endorsing Obama
on Twitter, and Lil B once again told us how
much he loved us. ’

Whereas hip—hop was once deemed an
indelible’ part of black culture, its rise in
inﬂuence isn’t simply the result of a demo-
graphic shift. Instead, hip—hop has become
an irremovable part of American‘ culture,
thanks to social networking, which now al-

lows anyone to know what Rick Ross really g

thinks. .

So if Tupac had a Twitter, it’d be hard not
to imagine him posting a vulgar hotel room
picture a la Chief Keef one minute and the
next, speaking on the ills of capitalism. All
Pac and any rapper really wants is for us

to hear them out and give them the time of .

day because society, their family, teachers
or someonein the past was unwilling to. At

the very least, I think the East Coast—West

Coast beef would have been a lot less violent
if emojis were somehow involved. I

Pitt’s struggles
againstfthe zone
subside for now

Nate Barnes 1
Staff Wrz'ter

When the then No. 4 Michigan
Wolverines used a 1-3-1 trapping
zone to disrupt Pitt’s offensive
ﬂow in the second half of the Nov.
21 contest at Madison ‘Square
Garden, it worked great. Lead-
ing by four at the break, Pitt shot
38.5 percent the rest ofthe game,
and Michigan came back to win.

. But these struggles haven’t
come out of thin air for the Pitt
men’s basketball team. In its ﬁrst
scrimmage this year against Di-
vision II Indiana University of
Pennsylvania —- a game many

‘fans expected to be over ‘and

decided early —- Pitt found of-
fense hard to come by against
a matchup zone. The Panthers
scored only 21 first-half points
and couldn’t pull away from the
Hawks until the second half was
well under way.

Although the Panthers have a
record of 8-1, a number of their
wins came in a much more dif-
ficult manner_than the ﬁnal box

scores will show — especially —
v Saturday night’s 74-61 home

win over the Detroit Titans. As
nearly every one of Pitt’s prior

H opponents have done, the Titans

moved into a 2-3 zone to take
away Pitt’s size advantage in the
paint, which played a key role
in Detroit’s 37-29 halftimelead,
with the Panthers shooting a very
below—average 35.7 percent.

As they "did _against How-
ard and Oakland, the Panthers
overcame their first-half diffi-
culties against the zone in the
second half against Detroit. But
as redshirt senior point guard
Tray Woodall — who scored 14
points and knocked down four
of his five 3-point attempts Sat-
urday — knows, Pitt still has a
lot to improve on against zone
defenses. .

“We still could get better
[against the zone]. That’s one
thing Coach said at the end of
the game. We’re going to work

on our zone looks. I think we

definitely could attack the zone
a lot better, but that’s deﬁnitely
getting us prepared for the teams
ahead. There’s going to be a lot of
other teams that show the 2-3,”
Woodall said.

Speciﬁcally, teams are using

‘ more of a “sagging zone” to com-

bat the Panthers’ interior pres-

ence, as Pitt head coach Jamie-

Dixon noted after the Detroit

.COI1t€Sl'..

“What we faced was a sagging
zone, so they really get in the
lane,” Dixon said. “We attacked
the zone better in the second
half, and I’ve said in the past that
we are not good enough against

the zone right now.”

Against the zones played by
Pitt’s opponents, Dixon acknowl-
edged that the big men are strug-
gling and that he must also do a

better job in coaching them to

play ‘against zone defenses.

“Our big guys are struggling
right now against the zone, and
I’ve gotta do a better job with
it. So I’ve gotta do a better job
coaching and getting them in the
right place and understanding
what we’re trying to do. That’s
something that I know and am
well aware of,” Dixon said.

' In Saturday’s game, Dixon did
note‘ that the Panthers showed
some positive signs of improve-
ment against the zone, but they
are not where they need to be yet.

“We’ve done a good job of not
really settling for 35 on the first
pass, especially in the second
half all of our open 3s came off
of penetration after reversals,
so that was probably the big-
gest [improvement]. We’ve just
got to work on it more, and our
guys just aren’t comfortable with
where they need to be. All zones
are different, but we face more

p sagging 2-3 zones,” Dixon said.

In particular, Dixon singled
out redshirt junior Lamar Patter-
son as the player who was able to
penetrate the Titans’ zone.

2010 and 2011 all resulted in Pitt victories.
Redshirt junior Ashlee Anderson sparked
the Panthers with 11 ﬁrst-half points. She also
contributedto two separate 6-0 scoring runs
in the second half, which put the home team in
control of the game." She ﬁnished with a game-

 

, high 17 points and nine rebounds for Pitt.

Anderson‘ is highly anticipating Saturday’s
game.

“Any added pressure would be that we just
need to beat Duquesne,” she said. “We have lost
to them the past couple years. It will be an-ex-
citing game. It is one of those games you look
forward to.”

Katie Sheahin led the Greyhounds with 16
points. .

Pitt’s perimeter defense looked much bet-

‘ ter than it has in past contests this season,

as the Panthers held Loyola to 2-12 shooting
from beyond the arc in the ﬁrst half. Overall,
the Greyhounds only managed to shoot a lowly
14.3 percent from 3-point—shot range and 30.9
percent (17-55) from the ﬁeld.

Looking ahead to Saturday, sophomore Cora
McManus said that, chancetobreakarecord or
not, the players’ desire will be the key to their
success.

“Pressure is thewrong word. I think it is
more determination. We just want to do it for
our coach, and we want to do it for us as we ,”
McManus said. She chipped in six points and
10 rebounds. “We work hard in practice every

single day [to] come out with a win.”

“[He] was good against the zone. He
was the one guy who was really getting in
the lane in the second half,” Dixon said.

The recurring reasons opposing coach-
es present as to why they are throwing
zones at the Pan-

strength and ability to offensive rebound,
but we wanted them to make contested
3s,” McCallum said. _

Clogging the area in front of the basket
has had its desired effect.

“If a team is packing it in, it’s going
to be harder to get touches, to get scores
and get the ball to big guys,” Dixon said

Historically, the team has shown the
ability to counteract zones, but this year
that ability hasn’t been immediately evi-

. dent.

“[Traditionally] we have hurt zones
with offensive rebounding. It sounds like
it happens by accident. Many people may
look at it that way, but when you do it year

after year, and

thers stem from a
desire to take the
inside away from
Pitt, neutralize the
Panthers’ size ad-
vantage and slow
the game down.

Howard head coach Kevin N ickelberry said
Tuesday night.

Detroit head coach Ray McCallum also ,
aimed for his Titans to force Pitt to make *

contested 3-point attempts, shots much
more difficult than what the Panthers are
most comfortable with — scoring from
inside the paint.

“It was time for somebody to, prove
they could make shots. I wanted them to
not beat us in the paint. We knew their

Tuesday night after Pitt defeated Howard.

Dixon knows the keys to beating de-
fensive zones, however, the primary key
lies within the Panthers’ ability to grab
offensive rebounds. .

. “We have to get more put backs, of-
fensive rebounds against the zone. That’s
something you needto get, and we aren’t
getting enough [of ],” he said. f‘We have
to get better at our interior touches, and
that is our biggest thing against the zone.
We just aren’t active enough.”

Game at Consol 

Energy Center, the Duquesne Dukes didn’t
utilize a zone against the Panthers as much
as Pitt’s prior opponents. But when they
did, Pitt handled it with ease, showcasing
some level of improvement in the four days
between the contests against the Titans
and Dukes. .

“We really picked it apart,” Dixon said.
“That was an emphasis the last couple
days.” I

“We worked on some things with rebound-
ing,” Dixon said. “He’s a great kid, and he has
gotten better. It’s fun to have him on the team.”

The freshman ended the game just shy of
a double-double, tallying eight points and 14
rebounds. '

Offensively, Pitt redshirt junior forward La-
mar'Patterson said that when his teammates
saw that Woodall was feeling conﬁdent with
his shot, they knew he needed to have the ball.

. “We like to feed the hot hand, and he deﬁ-
nitely had it today,” Patterson said of Woodall.

Woodall, who ﬁnished with a game-high -

24 points, said that it was important to him
and fellow senior Dante Taylor to win against
Duquesne in their ﬁnal game against Pitt’s city
foe. , A .

A “This is my last go-aroun ,” Woodall said.

“I deﬁnitely didn’t want to go out as a senior _ ‘

losing to Duquesne.” .

In the second half, Duquesne used a small
spurtto cut the deﬁcitto 11 points, but the Dukes
never sustained enough consistent offense to
suggest that they would complete a comeback.

With a 41-30 lead, Pitt effectively ended the
game with a- 17-9 run that gave the Panthers a
19-point lead.

fense in recent games, the~Pa.nthers pleased

Dixon by holding the Dukes to just 45 points
on 31.6 percent shooting. Pitt also dominated
the glass as a team, winning the rebounding
margin 49-33. V

“They came out and hit a 3-pointer on the
ﬁrst play, and the last two days of emphasiz-
ing guard, that was thrown out the window,”
Dixon said. “But we ended up doing a good job, I
thought we really defended well. We rebounded
well. The numbers indicated that.”

Despite being visibly frustrated with his
team’s performance, ﬁrst—year Duquesne head
coachjim Ferry said that the City Game needs
to continue.

“As long as I’m here, this game will be
played,” Ferry said. “With everything else go-
ing on with schools ﬂip—ﬂopping conferences,
this game has to be played.”

Dixon agreed. 2

“I think we had a great crowd for a rniddle—
of-the-week game,” he said, noting the an-
nounced attendance of 13,089. “[This game]
is important to us. I ’s- important to them.”

The Panthers now lead the all—time series
with the Dukes 50-31. V ~
