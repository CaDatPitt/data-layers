Supreme court will

review suit against Pitt

By’ Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor -

The Supreme Court has said it
will review a trial concerning an
alleged racial discrimination case
against the University of
Pittsburgh.

Matthew E. Jackson, Jr., an at-
torney and former employee of
Pitt's legal department, is filing
the case which is based on his
discharge from the University on
February 3, 1984 by David Sul-
livan, Pitt's former General Coun-
sel and Jackson's supervisor.

This trial will be a step beyond
a June, 1986 decision on Appeal
from the United States District
Court that found ”no evidence of
racial animus.” The court did
note ”abundant instances of un-
satisfactory work performance
[by Jackson].”

Consideration by a higher court
could provide an opportunity for

Jackson to have the decision
reversed. S
”Pitt is a big bully on the block,
and many students and faculty
are intimidated by such a large in-
stitution,” said Jackson.

Jackson said discrimination ”is
a problem at Pitt. I worked for
nine years [at Pitt] and l was pret-
ty well thought of by the people
I worked with,” said Jackson. He
said his supervisor, Sullivan,
”was rude and rough to me. He
had a general negative attitude
toward me.”

Speaking on behalf of the
university, Judy Frank of the
University Counsel, said ”No,
none of his charges are justified.
Jackson was just terminated.

”None of these [racial cases]

are usually justified,” added"

Frank.”The University has a good
track record with this kind of
case.”

Pitt faculty discusses
undergrad education

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

The present and future quality
of Pitt's undergraduate curricu-
lum was discussed yesterday by
Pitt administrators and faculty at
a formal conference held in
Forbes Quad.

”lt’s a very task-minded confer-
ence,” said Pitt provost Rudolph
Weingartner. ’’I began an intia-
tive of making modifications on
undergraduate education in the
fall and the conference was
designed to help forward this
process.”

Weingartner‘ said-that various
”working groups”, consisting of
Pitt faculty, attended the confer-
ence to make recommendations
concerning specific topics of un-
dergraduate education.

”My goals are to give a richer
undergraduate education to be
more aware of student learning
and to be more aware of the in-
terests and needs of the stu-
dents,” Weingartner said.

Mary Briscoe, Pitt dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences
reviewed the current undergradu-
ate requirements for CAS
students. —

Briscoe said her staff is current-
ly analyzing data of general edu-
cation requirements involving a
random sample of 300 students
who have completed ‘ their
degrees sincethe new curriculum
was established in September of
1983.

”As we complete the analysis.

of this student sample, we will
begin to formulate questions for
a student survey that will enable
us to learn more about their reac-
tions to the effectiveness of the re-
quirements once they have
graduated,” said Briscoe.

Briscoe stressed that more at-
tention should be paid to under-
graduate teaching and interactive
education, as well as a willing-
ness of faculty to ”change the cul-
tural context of their thinking and
teaching.”

’’It [the conference] is not
[designed] to just make noises in
the air but to stimulate ideas of
discussion about things we are
considering,” said Weingartner.
”lt’s important as part of a larger
process.”

The conference featured two
speakers and four panel discus-
sions. Joseph Katz, director of the
New Jersey Master Faculty Pro-
gram presented a lecture titled
”Does Teaching Help Learning”
and Hannah Goldberg, provost of
Wheaton College spoke on
”Broadening Curricular Perspec-
tives”. Panel discussions includ-
ed ”Academic Advising As
Education”, ”Faculty Develop-
ment Across Disciplines And
Schools”, ”University-Wide Re-
quirements For Undergraduate
Education”, and "The Interna-
tional Dimension.”

Weingartner said he was
pleased with the participation in
the conference. _”The discussion
has been very high quality,” he
said. '

Rather defends Bush interview

By Kathryn Baker

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK -— CBS anchor
Dan Rather offered viewers "a

personal word” Tuesday_

night, but didn't back down
on his combative interview
with Vice President George
Bush that aired during the
previous night's ”CBS Evening
News.”

After correspondent Bruce
Morton reported on the polit-
ical fallout surrounding the in-

terview, Rather made a brief

statement.

”However it may seem at
any given time, the intention
of even persistent questioning
in a spirited ‘interview is to do
an honest, honorable job,”
Rather said. ”The fact that
more attention is somet‘mes
given to the heat than the light
is regrettable, but it goes with
the territory.”

Rather also said the abrupt

ending to the interview wasn't
”done as gracefully” as in-
tended.

Both ABC and NBC led their
Tuesday night newscasts with
stories about the controversial
CBS interview. Rather got
some support from colleague
Peter Jennings at ABC's
”World News Tonight.”

”Reporters and their sub-
jects often mix it up,” Jennings
said during the newscast, ”and
sometimes lose their tempers ,
and sometimes lose control.
You never see it happening in
the newspaper. On television,
especially when it's live, the
camera is always there.”

Earlier in the day, Rather
and his boss, CBS News Presi-
dent Howard Stringer, both
said Rather was just doing his
job.

”l saw my job as asking
questions about the central
story," Rather told reporters
who stopped him as he arrived
for work at the CBS Broadcast

Center, ”... howdid he (Bush)
get involved in sending mis-
siles to the Ayatollah and what
about these inconsistencies in
the record. '
”That’s where my focus
was,” he continued. ”Ques—
tions about how I do my job,
that's a whole other area. I
don't take any offense at that.”
Stringer, also intercepted by
reporters as he came to work,
said, ”This is a very important
issue that Dan Rather pursued
characteristically, with energy.
”That’s what Dan does for a
living. That's what a great
reporter does for a living. And
while I understand some peo-
ple in the audience may be
uncomfortable by that, that is
part of the political process.”
CBS Broadcast Group Presi-
dent Gene Jankowski, reached
Monday night by the New
York Post, said the interview
”speaks for itself” _and
declined to give his opinion
on Rather.

Horne’s department store ch-ain put up for sale

PITTSBURGH — Joseph Horne
C0,, the second-largest depart-
ment store chain in the Pittsburgh
area, is for sale, but its chairman
says a deal is not imminent.

Harold H. Hammer, chairman
ofJoseph Home Co. and manag-
ing partner of theJMMC Group
Inc., which controls the store's
stock, said its board of directors
received several inquiries and at
least one offer for the sale of the
15-store chain last year.

Hammer said Joseph Horne
Co. has been talking to other
potential buyers, but he declined
to name them.

”The whole thing is heating
up,” he said.

‘Hammer noted that Campeau
Corp. of Toronto on Monday bid
$4.2 billion for Federated Depart-
ment Stores Inc. of Cincinnati, the
nation's fifth-largest retailing firm
and the second-largest depart-
ment store chain. Campeau ac-
quired Allied Stores Corp. in late
I986.

McKeesport hospital

fires union workers
MCKEESPORT, Pa. 1-

McKeesport Hospital officials
said Tuesday they have fired an
undisclosed number of cafeteria,
laundry and housekeeping wor-
kers and other employees who
left their jobs in an ”illegal
walkout” Monday.

The workers, members of
Teamsters Local 205, walked out
Monday morning to protest in-
creased work loads following
layoffs at the Allegheny County
hospital.

”The hospital did not receive
any notice of the walkout or
specific reason for the action,”
said Dottie Kulasa, hospital direc-
tor of community relations. ”The
walkout appeared to be orches-
trated by the leaders of Teamsters
Local 205.” .

Local 205 President Bill Lickert
could not be reached for com-
ment Tuesday.

A cook, Ray Stitanovic, said
workers ”were advised to walk
out” by Local 205 leaders. He
said he returned to work Tuesday
and was given a letter that said he
was fired because the union con-
tract saysthere will be ”no strikes
or cessation of work” during the

Stitanovic said workers were
angry because the hospital has
laid off several people in the past
several years and those remain-
ing have had to work harder.

”We felt that it wasn't right, so
we walked off,” he said.

Ms. Kulasa said all hospital

USX Corp. reveals its

fourth quarter losses

PITTSBURGH - USX Corp.
reported a $14 million fourth-
quarter loss Tuesday, but cited its
1987 profit of $219 million as
proof its recent restructuring and
operating strategies ”are begin-
ning to work.”

The Pittsburgh-based energy
and steel giant said the fourth-
quarter loss was due to a $96 mil-
lion charge for the decreased
market value of its crude oil in-
ventories.

USX said the loss amounted to
13 cents per common share on
sales of $4.2 billion, compared to
a 1986 fourth—quarter loss of
$1.42 billion, or $5.55 per com-

mon share, on sales of $2.8
billion.

It said the fourth quarter would
have shown an $82 million profit
if not for the $96 million adjust-
ment to crude oil inventories of
its Marathon Oil subsidiary.

For 1987, USX’s $219 million
profit represented 54 cents per
common share on sales of $14.8
billion. For 1986, the corporation
reported a loss of $1.83 billion,
or $7.46 per common share, on
sales of $14.9 billion.

clenching of jaw muscles by
clenching on purpose,” said
Pierce.

According to Pierce, ”research
shows that splints and nighttime
biofeedback works, but if treat-
ment is of a short period -— only
two weeks, after cessation of
treatment, bruxxing usually
returns to pre-treatment levels.”

Pitt’s Central Research De-
velopment Fund awarded Pierce
a $7,300 grant last spring. He has
applied to National Institute of
Health for a $300,000 grant to be
used in a five year study. If award-
ed, Pierce would receive the
grant this summer.

”We’re doing a small pilot
study, looking for treatment ef-
fect,” said Pierce. ”We’re look-
ing for volunteers to participate in

a study that will last seven or
eight months. This means the
subject would complete an ex-
tensive initial examination, focus-
ing on their history of bruxxing.
Dental impressions would be
made, and psychological ques-
tionnaires would be completed
for comparative research stu‘ ‘
ing. Those accepted then go ‘i-

our protocol study. We'll as l

them to come back a year later.”

One device used in treatment
research is an electromyograph,
operated by a nine-volt battery.
This has three electrodes attached
to the cheeks to measure jaw
muscle activity. Evaluation in-
cludes before and after treatment,
said Pierce.

if you would like to volunteer
for the study, call 648-8460.

Shuttle booster problems to delay summer launch  

WASHINGTON —— NASA en-
gineers have uncovered new
problems in space shuttle hard-
ware that could further delay the
shuttle’s next flight, according to
a published report.

The Washington Post reported

‘ in Tuesday's editions that the

new problem turned up in the
last few days in the shuttle
booster aft skirt segments and the
shuttle main engines.

The aft skirt is the cone—shaped
section of the booster that partial-
ly covers the steering nozzle and
provides rigid support for the
shuttle as it sits on the launch
pad.

"The problem in the main en-
gines was discovered last week,
when engineers testing an engine
for a future flight found ”mis-
tracking” in a weld in a part of
the enging turbopump known as
the first stage blade platform seal,
the newspaper reported.

North Korea puts stop

to contact with U.S.

TOKYO -— North Korea on
Monday banned contacts with
U.S. diplomats and halted talks

on Americans missing in the

Korean War, retaliating for sanc-
tions the United States imposed
for the destruction of a South
Korean jetliner.

The United States ”should be

held responsible” for the crash of
the Korean Air jet, the communist
government's Foreign Ministry
said in a statement carried by the
official Korean Central News
Agency and monitored in Tokyo.

The Japanese government im-
posed sanctions on North Korea
Tuesday because of the crash.

‘ A Foreign Ministry spokesman
in Tokyo said contact between
Japanese and North Korean offi-
cials will be severely restricted
and crewmen of North Korean
ships entering Japanese ports will
be given stricter scrutiny. North
Korean aircraft will be denied
permission to land in Japan, he
said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

North Korea has been linked to
the November crash that killed all
115 people aboard and which
prompted the United States to im-
pose sanctions and brand North
Korea a terrorist state that did not
”live up to the standards of civi-
lized behavior.”

British soldiers face

sexual abuse charges

SOEST, West Germany — Two
British soldiers went on trial in a
British military court Monday on
charges of sexually abusing other
soldiers during initiation rites.

The accused privates, Ian For-
syth and Gavin Rae, are members

of the first battalion of the Kings
Own Scottish Borderers, sta-
tioned in West Berlin.

They are being court—martia|ed
under Section 70 of the British
Army Act 1955 on charges relat-
ed to bullying other soldiers.

A British military spokesman
said the two men allegedly sexu-
ally abused recruits during initi-
ation ceremonies in 1986.

Turkey sends home
soldiers from Iran

SEMDINLI, Turkey — Fifty-
seven armed Iranians who were
captured here two months ago
while en route to Iraq were
returned to their homeland, a
news agency reported.

The Iranians were driven to the
border post in this southwestern
township, where they were hand-
ed over to Iranian authorities, ac-
cording to the dispatch from the

independent Hurriyet news-

agency.

The Interior Ministry ordered
the release following negotiations
with Iran, and their guns and am-
munition also were returned,
Hurriyet said.

The Iranians made the crossing
in two separate groups into the
Turkish territory near the border
village of Tepecik on Nov. 28.
They had surrendered peaceful-
ly to Turkish security forces.

They had been sent by Kurdish
groups fighting the Iraqi govern-
ment to carry out attacks against
Iraqi military installations in the
northern part of the country, Tu r-
kish news agency reports at the
time said.

Colombian drug war

hea ts up after killings

BOGOTA, Colombia —— The
handcuffed body of Colombia's
kidnapped attorney general was
found outside Medellin after men
believed working for drug
traffickers riddled his car with
machine gun fire and killed two
bodyguards.

While searching the country-
side around Colombia's second-
largest city for Attorney General
Carlos Hoyos, security forces
stumbled onto a Bogota mayoral
candidate who was abducted by
narcotics traffickers Jan. 18.

The candidate, Carlos Andres
Pastrana, was unharmed and
police said they captured one of
his kidnappers. Pastrana, 34, is
the son of former President Mis-
ael Pastrana.

week and Hoyos’ murder Mon-

day were claimed by a group call-

-ing itself ”Los Extraditables,”

Spanish for those facing extradi-
tion. The group said it declared
”total war” on the government or
anyone else trying to extradite
Colombians to the United States
to face drug charges.

In Bogota, the president of the
council of state, Carmelo Marti-

nez, said Monday afternoon tha't$.~"

Hoyos’ attackers ”can only be the
drug traffickers the prosecutor has
strongly condemned.”

A man who telephoned radio
network Caracol said Hoyos was
”executed for betraying the coun-
try” in his drive to extradite
Colombians to the United States,
the radio reported.

”The war goes on. I repeat. The
war goes on,” the anonymous
caller said, Caracol reported. The
man gave the exact ‘location of
Hoyos’ body. ‘

Colombian President Virgilio
Barco vowed not to be black-
mailed by the cocaine barons
who killed Hoyos.

The nation's largest
newspapers voiced support Tues-
day for the U.S.-educated presi-
dent's pledge to bring to justice
the billionaire smugglers whose
bribes and private armies have al-

lowed them to operate with near

impunity.

An autopsy showed that Hoyos
was killed after his abduction in
a fusillade that shattered his skull.
Twelve bullets were found in the
body.

In a nationwide television and .
radio address Monday night, Bar- a

co said the government would
not ”surrender to vile blackmail
and infamous threats.”

Drug traffickers ’’will not in-
timidate us,” he said.

Barco has made it clear he isn't
backing down in the face of
threats from the ”nar-
cotraficantes,” who possess pri-
vate armies, bands of assassins
and influence in Congress.

The extraditions were suspend-
ed last year when the Supreme
Court struck down as unconstitu-
tional a 1979 extradition treaty
on a technicality. The govern-
ment now says either of two

- previous treaties will suffice.

Reagan serves the
same speechagain

Monday night, Americans were witness to what Ronald Rea-
gan promises to be his last State of the Union address. For the
most part, there were noradical changes or programs discussed
in the speech. Reagan told his audience that it was time to ”put
on your work shoes -— we're still on the job.” He called for
increased cooperation between himself and the Congress, a
vigorous attempt to cut federal spending and a re-evaluation
of the progress made on various social problems.

Reagan pledged to prove that ,”democracy works, even in
an election year.” We are united, he told the congress, by far
more things than we are divided, which is an idea that seemed
to be lost as he continued to blame Congress for most of the
problems now confronting his administration. _

He came to realize that “at last there is an agreement that
we can't spend ourselves rich,” referring to the need to con-

front the budget deficit. As well as asking for line-item veto pow- .

ers for the budget, Reagan suggested that a Constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget be enacted.

The President pledged to work for the continuation of nuclear
arms reductions. In his speech, his emphasis on the need for
a less armed world became apparent. Sixteen lines of the speech
were devoted to arms reduction agreements with the Soviets,
and 27 lines were devoted to furthering the causeof SDI.

Other topics mentioned at some length were: the need for

. a stronger and ‘more streamlined public education system, a
reform of the current welfare system, a new budget process and
prayer in the schools. He spoke out against abortion, an addi-
tion gauranteed to hijack public scrutiny of other parts of his
speech. ' _ . I

In short, Reagan did little but re-state the policies he endorsed
seven years ago. He re-asserted his hope that America not back

i down from its current machismo and asked that Congress join

I

him in these’ goals. . . ’
”We Americans like the future: like the sound of it, the idea

of it, the hope of it,” Reagan said midway through his speech. ‘

Indeed he likes the ‘sound of the future. It seems that, in his
own mind at least, most of his successes will lie there. For the
seventh time, he spoke glowingly of the future, a future domi-
nated by the ideas of Americans, a future rich for the Ameri-
cans, a future of peaceful grace for Americans. He spoke of the
”shining city on the hill” —— again.

Maybe, just maybe, before too long we will hear a State of
the Union address that is not an exercise in finger—pointing, but
rather an offer from the president to meet the Congress at least
half way. Even a fairly good movie can become mundane af-
ter seven viewings. A poor one can become nothing short of
depressing.

Wh wasn't the game shown?

_ _ football team next year, and sure,

A historic occurrence hap-
pened Monday night. Jerome
Lane broke, or should I say
demolished a backboard in Pitt's
game against Providence Col-
lege. It was an eventthat will not
be forgotten by anyone who wit-
nessed it. I was not, however, one
of those people.

Dr. Bozik, it is bad enough that
the university only supplies
enough student tickets to last un-
til_I1 am. the morning of distri-
bution. This is not my complaint,
though. I was able to overlook
the fact that for this one time, I
could not get a tic-ket since the
game was to be televised on
ESPN. What I cannot overlook is

I the fact that some “mysterious

force” weakened ‘my television
seton the night of the game.

There I sit in front ‘of my‘
I9-inch color TV set all ready.to
watch an exciting Big East match-
up. “Pitt versus Providence is

- . next,” announced Chris Berman

of ESPN. The next thing I know,
BLACKOUT. Needless to say, my
I9-inch color TV set is not as
operative as it onceused to be.
I could not imagine why my ca-
ble company would black out
such an event. In my anxiety to
find the evil force that deprived
me of watching my home team,
I decided to give those cable
pirates a call for some ’’logical’’
explanation._ After holding 10
minutes, presumedly while the
”next available representative”
was trying to calm down the rest
of the irate citizens of Pittsburgh,
he told me that it was under the
discretion of the University of
Pittsburgh to televise or not tele-
vise any game.

An ”evil force” indeed. Dr. Bo-
zik, I cannot see any rationale be-
hind your decision to black out
Monday's game. What can Pitt's
basketball program possibly gain

' from such a move? I am sure that
the 6,798 in attendance were"
surely in awe of the events that

’ transpired in the first few minutes

of the game. As Bill Hillgrove

‘punctually. exclaimed, "This is
one of the most monumental ’

things in sports you can see."
Well Dr. Bozik, while you were

sitting at the Field -House that

l.E'I"I'ERS.

night, there were many more
thousands of fans in the area, stu-
dents and residents included, that
at the least would have liked to
see their hometown, nationally
ranked team on the television.

Dr. Bozik, it bothersme that I
cannot get basketball tickets be-

cause my classes conflict with my’

ability to acquire a ticket before

the sun has reached its pinnacle,

It bothers me more that there
were people in the most remote
places in this country who proba-
bly care less about either of the
two teams that got the chance to
see the game while I listened to
Mr. Hillgrove rant and rave about
how the people watching will

have something to talk about30 I

years from now. It is my team. It
is Pittsburgh's team. How can
you allow a local blackout of a
nationally broadcasted event

’when_ our home facility only
holds 7,000 occupants, which
has sold out every Big East game
since I have been here (four
years)?

Dr. Bozik, I_ want some an-
swers, Next time, I will surely
skip my classes to obtain a ticket
since there is no reliability that I
can view it elsewhere. I am sure
that my professors will under-
stand. Isn't that why we are all
here?

Oh, I forgot  ”Let’s go PITT!"

they are distraught. Heyward can

and will, however, sign a deal ,

with an NFL team that will be so
lucrative, he need never concern
himself with getting ”an educa-
tion” to start ”a career.” Would
Pitt try so desperately to hold on
to a third-year accounting major
if he decided to take a job with
a major corporation before he
finished his degree work? If

I think not. Heyward is begin-

at least stop being so damned

I lost a friend this weekend. Yet,

believing it. And then again it hits
me, and I feel the loss, the hurt.
What he was to so many, but
how few knew. We were the for-
tunate, though. To me, he was a
mentor, a father figure, my con-
science, my friend. He knew
everything. How he could ex-
plain things. I wish I could
remember it all now.

We went out a-few weeks ago.
He said he owed me dinner. I
owed him more than he could
ever imagine. He bought dinner,
and we went to a play. We talked
— he talked. He could always
make me feel so good about life,
about people. He knew about art,

Giap subverted their colonial
rule. Kennedy inherited this ill-
starred commitment, and the next
15 years witnessed the rape of a

beautiful country.

In his farewell address in the
fall of 1959, Eisenhower, sensing
the manner in which he had been
used, mused aloud about the dra-

matic reconstruction of American v

industry and policy which
preceded his Administration, dur-

‘ ing the war against Hitler. During

Blitzkrieg, government planners
prevailed on private industry to
abandon isolationism and join
the war effort. Prior to the formal
commitment of America to
World War II, private industri-
alists, the remnants of the robber
barons, were chagrined by the
thought of so close a cooperation
with the government in industri-
al planning. During the war,
however, these industrialists were
pleasantly surprised to discover
how lucrative it all was. When
the war ended and the time came
to dismantle this gridlock, no one
had the willpower. Thus, Eisen-
hower observed, America had
given birth to a ”military-
industrial complex” and called

"upon the academic community

to be vigilant.
After the war, the red—baiting
campaign, on which Reagan

made his political career in
Hollywood, was used to mobi-
lize Americans into an i|l—advised
dependence on the tax—and—
spend policies of the military-
industrial complex. The misera-
b|e.Vietnam War was one result.
Under President Ronald Wilson
Reagan (anagram: insane anglo
warlord), this industrial menaceﬁ
became really ugly and now
threatens the economic health
and political freedom of our
nation.

To appreciate this opinion, you
should understand the difference
between long-term and short-
term industrial health. Reaga-
nomics was designed, very skill-
fully, to bolster the American‘
economy over the short term.
This short-term health was to give
enough time to make the Ameri-
can economy irreparably debt- \ .
ridden, while simultaneously ‘
maximizing its dependence on
the military. Thus, Reagan at
once knew and planned for the
inevitability of last October's
Wall Street crash. This crash was
inevitable and specifically intend-
ed. Nearly every expert had
predicted the crash. It is incon-
ceivable that Reagan did not
know.

A look at the faces behind the Census statistics

I have a young friend who will
tell you, if you ask, that she grew
up in an ”intact, single-parent fa-
mily.” It is a phrase she invented
some years ago when she got
tired of hearing her family
described in pathological terms.

She and her mother were not
broken. Her home did not oper-
ate on crutches. She was not a
”child ofdivorce," but a child of
two parents who no longer lived
together.

My young friend was making a
point. All single-parent families
do not come in one flavor: weak.
There are as many varieties as
among two-parent families. Hers
tasted strong. I thought of her last
week when the Census Bureau
released its figures. Nearly a
quarteriof all American children
now live with one parent. More

C than half will spend some time in

a single-parent household before
they are 18.

Two—thirds of these households
are created by divorce or separa-
tion. Most of them, 89 percent,
consist of mother and children.
What was once a deviant pattern
has become ordinary.

In deference to my friend, we
might have to subdivide this
category into its meaningful parts.
After all, the real—life experience
of a child of shared custody is
different than that of a child with
a parent who disappeared. The
life experience of a child who
slides down the economic chute
is different from one who remains
secure.

A toddler's experience with
divorce is, in turn, different from
that of ‘a teenager. A child whose
parents remain bitter has a differ-
ent life than those whose parents
are personally happy and civil to
each other.

You cannot walkthe city streets
and pick outthe telltale signs of
someone who grew up with one
parent. There is no pathology of

single-parentness. Yet I know
there is something shared by the
children counted by the Census
Bureau. An experience of loss. A
feeling of impermanence. An al-
tered sense of security. And
maybe even the hope that it
won't happen to their own.

Offspring of the strongest
single-parent households, those
kids who made it, those who can
explain by T4 or 15 precisely
why their parents couldn't live
together, who can negotiate their
way between two households,
perhaps even two new families,
share these feelings. Push a bit
into their cool surface and you
can touch a warm spot of
sadness.

The word ”family,” narrowed
down to its nucleus, evokes
primal feelings. The college-age
students who watch afternoon re-
runs of Ozzie and Harriet don't
just tune in for its camp humor.
There is also a hunger for entry
into these dated vignettes. To be
mom and dad and us kids for a
half an hour.

Even the competent, indepen-
dent teenagers who become part-
ners and confidants to their
divorced parents carry with them
another model of the perfect fa-
mily. What family would they
like to live in if they couldn't live
with their own? l expect they
share the majority's choice: Fami-
ly Ties. Do they want Michael
Fox as a brother? The other fan-
tasy —- two parents clearly in
love, two parents they can talk to
— is more compelling.

Once a single parent myself, I
often wonder how the 50 percent
of children who spend time in
one—parent families will fashion
their own. One childhood ex-
perience sends different internal
memos to the future.

Some may shy from marriage.
Others leap needfully, prema-
turely, into the business of creat-

ing a family. Some may take
themselves as proof that children
survive divorce. Others may find
the opposite evidence.
Probably the children of single-
parent families will try to correct
their elder’s mistakes. We all do

that. One generation vows they
won't do what their parents did:
stay locked together in a dead
marriage. The next generation
vows they won't do what their
parents did: split.

But what comes through all the
change, all the statistics, what re-
mains clear as the grain of wood
under a dozen coatings of stain,
is a constant ideal of mom and
dad and us kids. It may be as elu-
sive as the images on a television

screen, but it's just as powerful. 8

Life in the Census Bureau's
single-parent households is in-
deed as diverse as life in two-
parent households. But today, 50
percent of our children, even
those with an ”intact single fami-
ly,” will grow up knowing what
it's like to know that something
—— someone —— is missing.

1988 Hand-In-Hand Festival  
hopes to be a memorable one

by Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

Pitt's Hand-in—Hand Festival
will be celebrating its 10th an-
niversary with the theme ”Reach
for the Stars".

The Hand-in-Hand Festival is a
one-day event in which retarded
and handicapped children from
the Pittsburgh area join Pitt stu-
dents in a variety of games and
entertainment. These activities
are specifically designed to ac-
commodate these children and
their special needs.

Kelly O'Toole, one of the coor-
dinators for the Festival, said the
committees are "trying some new
ideas to make things special. I'm
really excited because of these
new things.” »

Cara Coyle, another coordina-
tor, said the Festival is "more or-
ganized” this year. "We have a

more experienced staff that gets '

along pretty well.”

Even with the returning staff,
both coordinators have stressed
that many Pitt students are need-
ed to make the Festival a success.

”We were able to recruit some
students early at Freshmen Orien-
tation,” said Coyle. "We still
need hundreds more."

Pitt students are used as facili-
tators and one—on—one volunteers
throughout the day. Both groups
must attend special training ses-
sions and meetings before the
Festival in order to learn certain
techniques necessary in dealing
with the needs of these children.

‘ 

If we just keep up
with what we've done
in the past, that, in it-
self, would be an ac-
complishment.

— Kelly O'Toole

"Last year we had around 350
children at the Festival,” said
O'Toole. "That was less than we
had had before. This year, .we'd
really like to see as many as 450
kids come out. in order to have
this many children, though, we
need more Pitt students.”

The Hand-in—Hand Festival,
although organized by universi-
ty students, is supervised by The
Office of Residence Life. Jon Con-
logue, a staff member of ORL, is

serving his first year as adviser to
the Festival.

"Jon has been really great,”
said Coyle. "The entire adminis-

, tration has been real patient.”

terest took over when he didn't
have any experience to back him
up. He's been super as far as

The Festival committee said it
wants to make this year's event
something to remember.

"We want to go a step beyond
what we have done before,” said
O'Toole. ’’If we just keep up with
what we've done in the past, that,
in itself, would be an accomplish-
ment. We'd really like to go
further."

”We’re proud of what we've
done so far," said Rob Springer,
public relations chairman. ”A lot
of time, effort and energy has
gone into everything so far.
We're really looking for a good
year."

A general information meeting
has been scheduled for anyone
interested in helping with this
year's Festival. It will be held Sun-
day, January 31 at 7:30 p.m. in
Dining Room A of the William
Pitt Union. All students are
welcome.

Dr. H ickeyremembered by Pitt

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

The University of P_i_ttsburgh
community is mourning the loss
of Dr. James Hickey, who died at

’ the age of 51 last Sunday of an

abdominal anurism at
Presbyterian—University Hospital.

"Robert Hickey served the
University of Pittsburgh for many
years with enthusiasm, dedica-
tion and loyalty,'’ said Pitt presi-
dent Wesley Posvar. "Bob greatly

appreciated Pitt's rich and color-
ful history, and was an ideal ex-
ecutive director of the
Bicentennial Commission."

Dr. Hickey had been associat-
ed with Pitt for the past nineteen
years. Since September, he was
the Director of Alumni Affairs for
the Health Sciences Schools -
Dental, Medical, Pharmacy,
Nursing and the Graduate School
of Public Health.

ment Office of the Health
Sciences Schools said that Hick-
ey always organized events that
were elegant and interesting.
"He did a splendid job. He
would work twenty—four hours a
day, seven days a week for the
University," said Vecchito.

Hickey's colleagues on the Bi-
centennial Commission spoke
highly of Hickey's dedication to
the Bicentennial.

Diane Ford, Hickey's secretary,
said that Hickey would always
find time to talk to students.

”Dr. Hickey felt that the world
is going to be changed and made
better by young people," said
Ford.

She said Hickey was particular-
ly proud of the many musical
events that took place during the
Bicentennial. ~

"He thought that music and art I

made life worth living,” she said.
A few of the events that Hick-
ey helped arrange include: the
Fireworks display on the opening
day of the Bicentennial Celebra-
tion, a concert of the Pittsburgh
Rennaisance and Baroque Socie-
ty and a performance of Mon-
teverdi’s Vespers. Hickey was
'also able to get Loren Maazel of
the Pittsburgh Symphony to write
a fanfare for the Bicentennial.

According to David Schwartz
of News and Publications who
served as an assistant to Hickey
on the Bicentennial Commission,
Hickey was a peacemaker among
the various groups who wanted
input into the Bicentennial.

”He put in a lot of time and ef-
fort with different groups during
the Bicentennial," said Schwartz.

Hickey recieved his Ph.D in
Education in 1975 from the
University of Pittsburgh. He is
survived by his sister, Constance
H. Black. of Scott.

THE PITT NEWS

Gottfried,

Heyward

and others making
.. headlines this week

All right, all right. But only be-
cause you’ve all been such won-
derful readers:

O Pitt head football coach Mike
Gottfried has relieved’ tension
among Panther football fans and
formally withdrawn the slip of
paper with his name on it from
the hat that will decide the Green
Bay Packer coac_hing job. Previ-
ously, Gottfried was also report-

ed to be among the candidates

being considered for the head po-
sition with the Cincinnati Ben-
gals, Southen Cal and Ohio State.

THOMAS
DANYIJJK

The latest rumor has it that
Gottfried is in prime contention
for the vacated position of head
lettuce-grater at Taco Vista. But
don't believe it; Taco Vista closed
down over the summer.

0 From the Can Ya Top That

Department: It is considered a.

rarity to have a black at quarter-
back in the National Football
League. Doug Williams of the
Washington Redskins will take
that one step further this Sunday
as he becomes the first black QB
ever to start, or even play for that
matter, in the Super Bowl. But
that’s not quite all. The ’Skins,
never ones to be outdone in
terms of creativity, will use a
white fella, rookie Brian Davis, at
none other than the cornerback
position. And in this day in age,
that may even be more amazing
that what Williams has accom-
phshed.

0 Craig ”|ronfridge” Heyward
has finally made the decision to

bag the books, pack the bags and
head off toward the NFL sup-
plemental draft. Leaving college
for the pros with NCAA eligibili-
ty still remaining, well, Herschel
Walker, Bernie Kosar and Brian
Bosworth have proved it can
work. On the other hand, Charles
Gladman, formerly of Pitt, has
proved it can also be quite fatal
to a football career. Some guys ar-
en't just ripe enough for the pros.

Heyward, not normally one to
make the best of decisions in off-
the—field situations, averaged 149
yards per game last season, but
did that in an average of 32 car-
ries a game. 4.6 yards a pop isn't
all that bad against the Navys and
Kent States of the NCAA. But
when matched up against the
Browns or Bears or even the Dol-
phins defense, it’s gonna be a
whole new' ballgame for this
280—pounder. (Well, maybe not
the Dolphins defense.)

0 Pitt's 90-56 win over the
Providence Friars on Monday
night proved to be the Panthers
biggest margin of victory in any
Big East game.

0. And speaking of the Provi-
dence game, Lou Christian of
Sorensen-Christian Industries,
makers of the backboard that Jer-
ome Lane shattered in that game,
reported that it requires a mini-
mum of 690-lbs. of force to shat-
ter the plexiglass window behind
the rim. Levese Smith of Tossback
Corporation, producer of the
break-away rim itself, said that a
force of 250—lbs. of force is re-
quired to destroy the rim. -That
adds up to a dandy 940 pounds
of slam that Lane politely un-
leashed on that one!

Wrestlingteam taking
act on the road, meet
Cleveland St. tonight

Joshua Sindler/The Pitt News
Senior Mike Tongel and the Panthers take their 5-1 record to Cleveland State.

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor *

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
will try to recover from last Satur-
day's disheartening 23-10 loss to
Lock Haven when they face
Eastern Wrestling League rival
Cleveland State tonight.

The meet will take place at
Cleveland State's Woodling Gym
at 7:30 p.m.

”This is going to be a real don-
nybrook,” Pitt coach Rande Stott-
lemyer said. ”This one is going to
be a tossup from the time that the
ref blows the whistle until the last
match is over.”

Pitt is currrently 5-1 overall and
0-1 in the EWL. The Vikings have
a 6-1 overall record and 1-0 mark
in league competition.

The Panthers are currently
ranked 20th in the country, while
Cleveland State is 22nd.

ya”! think both teams match up

well in a lot of weights,” Viking’s
coach Dick Bonacci said. ”The.
score should be very close.’’
Everybody will be watching the
matchup at 142—pounds. Pitt All-
American Pat Santoro will face
Dave Zahoransky, who was an
All-American two years ago. '
”| feel that this match is going
to be a lot closer than everyone
seems to think,” Bonacci said. ’’I
have a lot of confidence in Dave.
I think that if anyone will beat

Santoro this year, it will be

Dave.”

Santoro is currently ranked
number one by the Amateur
Wrestling News with a perfect
recordof 33-0.

Stottlemyer doesn't quite agree
with Bonacci about this match. ’’I
think that Pat is going to come
out and smoke him,” he said.
”They are supposed to have all
kinds of hoopla for this match.

LA JOLLA, Calif. —- For the
second straight year, the Den-
ver Broncos have made it to
the Super Bowl supposedly
without one of the required
vehicles for making it — a run-
ning game.

You could write off one trip
as a fluke. But two. Maybe
there's more to the Broncos"
ground game than meets the
eye.

During the regular season,
the Denver running attack,
although unheralded and
often maligned, ranked a
respectable 12th in the
28-team NFL, averaging 131.3
yards per game.

Sammy Winder, who
regained his starting spot after
Gerald Willhite broke his leg

Broncos live without run

in the sixth game, finished the
year with 741 yards on 196
carries, leaving him as the fifth
most productive back in the
AFC.

Those were hard—earned
yards, too. Winder never had
any breakaways to inflate his
average; his longest run from
scrimmage was 19 yards.

With Winder, what you see
is what you get, much like the
other Denver backs — Gene
Lang, Steve Sewell, Ken Bell
and Tony Boddie.

They are versatile and de-
pendable. They rarely miss a
block, drop a pass or fumble.
In many ways, they're carbon
copies of their head coach, a
do-it—all, self-made runner with
the Dallas Cowboys named
Dan Reeves. -

”Sammy has been to two
Pro Bowls, which gives you an

I back. He doesn't have great

idea of the type of regard he's
held in by his peers,” Reeves
said.

"He's just not a big-name

explosiveness or put up im-
pressive numbers. All he does
is do his job, and he's very un-
selfish.”

The Washington Redskins,
Denver's Super Bowl oppo-
nent on Sunday, have taken
notice of the Bronco backs.

"They're criticized for not
having a running game, but
they run it good enough,”
Redskins’ linebacker Monte
Coleman said. "Their passing
game is their strong suit, so
that's what they emphasize,
naturally. '

”There’s no way we've un-
derrated their backs. They're
good, and they play a key role

in their success.”

AP Sports Writer

SAN DIEGO — They don't
have a nifty nickname like Den-
ver's "Three Amigos," but the
Washington Redskins’ trio of run-
ning backs figure to- be just as im-
portant in the Super Bowl.

The last time Washington got
into the Super Bowl, the running
game was left entirely to John
Riggins. The Redskins still use the

one-back offense, but now it's a

. different back for every occasion

-— the epitome of specialization.

Riggins, who has criticized the
Redskins’ running game this sea-
son, should feel honored. He was
replaced by not one but three
runners: George Rogers, rookie

Timmy Smith and Kelvin Bryant.

Rogers, a former Heisman
Trophy winner, is the starter. He
is the power runner, the type of
guy who runs straight ahead with
his head down and his muscular
legs churning. L

Smith is a bit quicker to the out-
side. He often replaces Rogers af-
ter two or three series. He is the
Redskins’ leading rusher in the
playoffs with 138 yards.

Then there's Bryant, easily the

Together, the threesome to-

In fact, Riggins gained 1,347
yards in 1983, leading the Red-
skins to their last Super Bowl ap-
pearance. This season, Rogers,
Smith and Bryant gained 1,145 -
just 202 fewer in three fewer
games.

"Their running attack is what
got them here," Denver lineback-
er Ricky Hunley said. "Rogers is
a bruiser who can guarantee
three or four yards when you
need them, Smith is a little faster
and just as strong, and Bryant is
versatile, probably one of the best
athletes on the field."

When Bryant joined the Red-
skins, Rogers knew he would be

Redskins’ Manley sets
his sights on Elway,
Broncos this weekend

By Dave Goldberg

4P Football Writer

SAN DIEGO — "When I get to
my man," said Dexter Manley,
Washington's voluble defensive
end, "I like to smash him right be-
tween the numbers.”

"What happens if he only has
one number" Manley was asked.

”Ah hah," he replied, "you
know something."

As the Super Bowl buildup be-
gan in earnest Tuesday, the man
with one number, Denver Bron-
co No. 7, john Elway, was the
overriding topic of conversation.

Could the blond Superman in
the orange cape lift the Broncos
to a Super Bowl victory over the
final obstacle to glory they failed
to scale last season? '

Could the Washington Red-
skins win for the second time this
decade by suceeding at their sin-
gle mission: stopping him by hit-

At the first few interview ses-
sions roughly two-thirds of the
questions to members of both
teams contained the word
”Elway."

Elway and coaches Joe Gibbs
of Washington and Dan Reeves
of Denver, for example, were
asked if the game will go as El-
way goes. Both, of course, said
no, although Gibbs qualified it by
saying "we can't stop him, but
we have to contain him." .

Nonetheless, they noted that a
contest between teams as close-
ly matched as these could turn on
a play in which Elway isn't in-

volved, such as the one made by 2

Jeremiah Castille.

Broncos here by stripping
Cleveland's Earnest Byner of the
ball just as the Browns fullback

was about to score the tying
touchdown in the final minute of
the AFC championship game.

”A gamecan be decided by
just one play, one turnover, one
break,” Gibbs said.

”We have some guys who may
get on the field for just three or
four plays. One of those plays
could be the one that turns the
game.”

And Redskins linebacker
Monte Coleman noted that El-
way, a throwback to the old tri-
ple threat, is really a quadruple
threat. He can run, throw, even
punt —— and if he does none of
those, just causing defenders to
think about it is danger in its own
right.

”lf we pay too much attention
to him, somebody else will hurt
us,” Coleman said. ”We can all
be looking at us and they can use
their running game to shoot right
by us.”

l’m afraid they are going to be
dissapointed.”

The two wrestlers have faced
each other before. Two years ago
Santoro was able to hold off Za-
horansky and register a win.

’’I have been thinking about
this match all week,” Santoro
said. ’’It could be my toughest
bout so far this year.

"Cleveland State is really solid
throughout their whole lineup, so
it will be close. Whoever comes
in ready will win the meet.”

The Vikings hold a 7-1-1 ad-
vantage over the Panthers in EWL
meets. '

’-’Most likely this will not be a
blow out,” Stottlemyer said. ”We
just have to be ready.”

Although the teams seem to be
evenly matched, the coaches see
it shaping up differently.

"Whoever can get the momen-

tum early will win the match,"
Bonacci said. ”Santoro won't be
able to start or stop any kind of
momentum for them. The key
matches will be from 1 18-pounds
to 134-pounds. Those three will
turn the meet one way.”
Stottlemyer sees it another way.
’’I think that there are about
nine swing matches. There is
only one key that I can see to this
one. That is one team will have
to get the close matches their
way. If we can do that, we can"
win the whole thing,” he said.
After tonight’s match the Pan-
thers will take a small break from
their EWL schedule. Pitt will trav-
el to Annapolis, MD to face Navy

Cook helps serveWildcats to number one

By Arthur H. Rothstein

TUCSON, Ariz. - Anthony
Cook of Arizona takes a lot of kid-
about his 6-foot-9,
190-pound frame. His roomate
says he is so skinny that he rents
a shadow.

Nobody jokes about Cook's
contribution to the success of the
top—ranked, 18-1 Wildcats.

There was a time when the

CLANDOVER, Md. — The
Washington Bullets, whose

 playoff chances seemed remote

10 games ago, have a new look
under their new coach, Wes
Unseld. '

The Bullets have won eight of
their 10 games for Unseld after

' opening the season 8-19 under

7—foot, 250-pound wide-bodies,
the monster marauders of the
driving lane, had an easy time
making life difficult for skinny
guys like Cook.

Over the spring, summer and
fall, Cook, whose teammates call
him ”A.C.,” hit the weight room
in earnest, and it paid off.

The junior has been Arizona's
leading rebounder at 7.5 per
game, while scoring at a

over as the head coach after own-
er Abe Pollin relieved Loughery
of his coaching duties on Jan. 3.

In less than three weeks, Un-
seld has taken this team that
couldn't shoot, couldn't rebound
and couldn't win at home and
turned ‘it into a playoffcontender.

”Looking back on it, no, I

didn't think it would be this.

quick,” Unseld said after the

12.1—point clip, and his 69.8 per-
cent field goal shooting in
Pacific-10 Conference games has
him tied for the lead.

Cook, who set a school record
69 blocks last season, has 36 this
year, including 17 in Arizona's
eight league games, ranking him
second in the conference.

”He’s unbelievable on defense,
he's so quick, he can jump so
well,” says guard Steve Kerr.

Bullets defeated the Philadelphia
76ers 118-117 Monday night in
overtime.

”We still have -a long way to

”People talk about dominant

a dominant center, we could do
this or that. I

”As far as I'm concerned, An-
thony is a dominant center. He
blocks and alters numerous shots
every game. He's our dominant
force.”

Coach Lute Olson said Cook is
”the guy that changes a lot of
shots. I think people are always

.”lt’s easy to say that there's a
new attitude when you're win-
ning a fewigames than when

’ you’re.coming off_losing a few
» games. When we get in tough sit-

uations, it will be interesting to
see how we react.”

The Bullets reacted like" win-
ners in tough situations Monday
night. They twice rallied from
10-point deficits, overcame a

aware ofwhere he is” — both in-
side and on the perimeter.

And Olson added, on the back-
boards ”in the game against the
big, tough jumpers, he's usually
the guy that can go up and get
’em with anyboddy.” ’

On a team that can boast of star
forward Sean Elliott and Kerr, an
all-Pac-10 performer two years
ago sidelined last season by inju-
ry, Cook is ”probably the unsung
hero of the squad,” Olson said.

Larry Holmes got a beating. _He

3 also got satisfaction.
- _.Doubts no longer linger in his

mind as they did when he retired
following his split-decision loss to

“Michael Spinks.in 1986.
“One more fight, then I'll re- .
tire,” the 38-year-old former_
heavyweight champion said at a

party in his suite several hours af-

ter he was knocked out by Mike

Tyson.‘ ‘ __
Holmes laughed as a couple of

acquaintances feigned , amaze-

ment at his little joke _—‘ a joke

' given a twist by Holmes’ bl_ue

sweatshirt, which was inscribed,

”.You’can-’t keep a good man’

down.’’- , .
. “You got a lot of spending
“money,” someone shouted at

-Holmes, who made $2.8 "million

for his final fight.

”The question, is do I have
credit "Holmes shouted back.
Credit as boxer, not a financi-
er, is what Holmes has long com-
plained about, although people
.in the sport gave him his due. He
seemed to confuse respect with
‘celebrity. Muhammad Ali tran-
scended the bounds of boxing,
Holmes didn't. Most fighters
-don't. ’ ’
Holmes was the best man in
the heavyweight division for a lit-

‘ tle more than seven years before

an embittered retirment on Nov.
6, 1986. -
. After winning his first 48 fights,
Holmes lost two 15—round deci-
sions to Spinks. . .
“The year and a half I've been
laid off from fighting was the
most enjoyable time I've had
since I started boxing,” said Hol-
mes, who turned pro in 1973 and
‘became a champion in 1978. But

the spIit—decision defeat in the se-
cond Spinks fight was a bone in
his throat.

”I wanted to come back and
prove something,” he said im-
mediately after the Tyson fight. ’’I
didn’t like the way I went out.”

This attitude invites a compar-
ison to Muhammad Ali, to whom
Holmes has been compared ad
nauseum.

Ali has never admitted it, but
there is reason to believe that, at
age 39, he fought Trevor Berbick
in I981 only because of his loss
to Holmes the previous year.

former United States Football
League star. Now that Smith has
emerged as a standout, Rogers is

playing even less.

But he has no complaints.
Rogers admits he has had a sub-
par season because of injuries —
he has sprained his toe, shoulder
and ankle in addition to pulling
a groin muscle — so he sees no
harm in letting Smithhelp carry
the load.

On occasion, after -being
replaced by Smith, Rogers even

asked Giblos to keep the rookie in .

the game becauselhe was playing
so well.

Denver's Amigos, recievers
Vance Johnson, Mark Jackson
and Ricky Nattiel, are friends off
the field. So are Rogers, Smith
and Bryant.

When Bryant first came to the '

Redskins, he stayed at Rogers’
Virginia home and ultimately
bought a house on the same
block. Then, when Smith joined
the team out of Texas Tech,

Rogers put him up until he could .

find a place of his own.

The fight against Holmes was
stopped with Ali on his stool be-
tween the 10th and llth rounds;
which is no way for a legend to
end his career. So he fought Ber-
bick. Ali lost, but he left boxing
on his feet.

Holmes didn't leave on his
feet, but he left knowing he was
a victim of power and not the
subjectivity of scoring. He went
out on his shield.

Honor. ‘Good fighters under-
stand it within the bounds of their
sport. Fans and critics need not
understand it.
