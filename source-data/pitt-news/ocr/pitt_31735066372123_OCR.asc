' President 'Reagan’s recent con-
demnation of Cuba as one of five
terrorist states that has carried out
“outright acts _of war” against the
United States may have an effect on
the University of Pittsburgh’s pro-
posed exchange program with" the
University of Havana.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar said
yesterday that Reagan’s speech con-
cerns him because it might have a
serious impact on a comprehensive
exchange program with Cuba that
has been on the planning board at
Pitt’s Center for Latin American
Studies for seven years.

“lt would worry me," Posvar said,
“although I think that academic
exchanges are all the more valuable

in an environment where diplomatic
and strategic concerns are so trou-
blesome. Academic exchange is
totally non-political. Its not threat-
ening to anyone, and it can be poten-
tially helpful in the long term.”

A recent article in The New York
Times quoted President Reagan as
accusing Cuba of openly arming,
training and directing terrorists on
at least three continents. Diplomatic
relationslbetween Cuba and the U.S.
became more strained after Castro
retaliated by outspokenly criticizing
the president.

“This Reagan is a madman, an
imbecile, a bum,” he said.

If diplomatic relations between
Cuba and the U.S. continue this

way, representatives from both the,

University of Havana and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh may not be able
to secure visas, Posvar said. ‘

According to _Carmelo Mesa-
Lago, director of Pitt's Center for

 Will Reagan'sat’racks hurt
Pitt's proposed exchange?

Latin American Studies and archi-
tect of the proposed exchange pro-
gram, securing a visa for travel to
Cuba has already been an obstacle
for representatives from Pitt. These
new developments make a compli-
cated Drocess even more difficult.

“l had invited the rector of the

University of Havana to visit here in '

August,” Posvar said, “but now
these recent developments have
made me anxious about making sure
that the project is carried out."

The exact consequence that Rea-
gan's speech and its subsequent po-
'itical ramifications will have on

Pitt’s proposed exchange program

with Cuba are not yet clear.

“At this point,” Posvar said, “all l
can do is hope that over a period of
months, this kind of political talk
will blow over. Until then, w-e’lljust
have to wait and see."

Posvar seeks staff reduction

in Public Safe’ry Deparfmen’r    

By Richard Tourfellotf
Staff Writer '

University of Pittsburgh Presi-
dent Wesley Posvar is calling for a
reduction in the Public Safety
Department’s staff, according to the
recently published University Plan

"for 1985-1990. Posvar asked the

University Police to provide campus
security with fewer officers.
According to the plan, “Further
actions, however, should be taken to
reduce public safety staff while sus-
taining essential services.” The pub-
lic safety staff has been reduced by
seven positions since 1979.
Currently, the University Police
have 55 officers -— three of whom
work in plainclothes ~— l5 guards
and three detectives. They provide
the campus with 24-hour protection.
Assistant director of public safety,
Walter Waters, said, “One way to

lower expenses is to use a guard in
place of an officer.” The guard’s
work is primarily stationary and
mostly indoors.

“We pay roughly nine to l0 dol-
lars per hour for a police officer,”
Walters said, “whereas we get these
guards for about six dollars per
hour. So you see, it‘s a substantial
savings.” M t _

Waters said his department’s
employment of guards rather than
officers is a trend that will continue.
“Using guards for routinejobs frees
the officers and allows them to do
police work.” ~ —

The Public Safety Department
also plans to hire three civilians to
replace officers who have desk jobs.
The department will change the

communication officer’s position to -

the civilian job of dispatcher/clerk.

“The university is constantly
expanding and our department is
called upon to provide coverage
with no increase in staff. We have

been consistant in size for the last 10
years,” Waters said. A
According to Waters, the staff
was much larger during the days of
student unrest. “Now things have
slowed down; we’re getting into a
little more _sophisticated crime.”
Waters said stealing of equipment

_,is a major problem. “Faculty and
« "staff are not above theft and crime,”

Waters said.

Dr. John Vrana, assistant vice
president for University Business
and Finance, said he believes the
plan will “in_no way decrease essen-
tial field service.” He said the target
is a three to five ‘percent budget
reduction for the University’ Police
over the next five years.

“We haven't put it in terms of peo-
ple,” Vrana said. He claims that
changes in technology will allow
university police to maintain and
upgrade campus security without an
increase in manpower.’

 
   

Chaz Pallal The Pitt ew

(UPI) ~ One day after Presi-
dent Reagan branded Fidel Cas-
tro as a terrorist and a “squalid
criminal,” The Cuban leader is
calling Reagan “the biggest ter-
rorist in the history of
humanity.” '

This follows Reagan's con-
demnation of five “outlaw
states,” including Cuba, as “a
confederation of terrorist states”

that had carried out “outright

Castro blasts , Reagan,

acts of war” against the United
States.

“And we are especially not
going to tolerate these attacks
from outlaw states run by the
strangest collection of misfits,
looney tunes and squalid crimi-
nals since the advent ofthe Third
Reich,” the president said.

Castro responded accord-
ingly. “lt is an attempt to frighten
Cuba,” he said, “This Reagan is a
madman, an imbecile, a bum.”

Chemistry prof dies

Dr. Frederick Kaufman, 65,» a
chemistry professor whose love of
teaching, according to colleagues,’

transcended all other facets of his‘

profession, died last Saturday in
New York City. v

A resident of 5854 Aylesboro
Ave., SquirrelHill, he died of com-
plications from a respiratory infec-

tion at Memorial Sloan Kettering-

Hospital in New York.

K aufman joined’ the university as i

a lull professor in 1964 and was the
chairman of the chemistry depart-
ment from 1977 through 1980. He
was recognized as one of the out-
standingieducators in America” in
1971 and 1975. He was director of
Pitt’s Space.Research Coordination
Center since 1974. l

Kaufman was also very involved
with research that led to the ban of
fluorocarbon aerosol propellants in
the United States. He was called
upon several times to testify before
congressional panels on the effect of
new technology on the environment,
and he was one of the key "scientists
called on to discuss the impact of the
supersonic transportjet’s exhaust on
the upper atmosphere.

Subway finally opens,
will serve South Hills

Finally! The Pittsburgh Subway opening! With free subway rides;
concerts; ice-cream; local, state and federal officials; transit, business
and civic leaders; puppet shows and the Pirates, the downtown
subway‘ segment of PAT’s 10.5-mile Light Rail Transit reconstruc-
tion project launched its grand opening July 3. .,

Revenue service began July 7 when the new LRT vehicles left the’

rails, and thetrolleys moved below to provide service to Castle
Shannon, South Hills Village and Library via the Overbrook line
until the LRT project is completed between Downtown, Dormont,
Mt. Lebanon, Castle Shannon and South Hills Village in late 1986.
Port Authority Transit Chairman James C. Roddey, of the Port
Authority of ‘Allegheny County, characterized the opening of the
downtown subway as one ofthe most significant events in the history
of transportation and economic development in Allegheny County.
“This is the blossoming ofan idea that was given roots -shortly after
the turn of the century, and it is thesuccessful culmination, at last, of
dozens of false starts made towards construction of a downtown
subway between l903 and 1976,” Roddey said._ -
Downtown subway stations are located at Gateway Center, Wood
Street, Steel Plaza, Station Square and Penn Park, and the system is
unique in that it incorporates a public arts program as a meanstof
enhancing transit rides with works of art ‘at various LRT stations.

Getting 0 job: letyour broin guide you

Staff Writer

You can earn the money you want
doing what you want to do, accord-
ing to Ladonna Green Bates. In a
seminar sponsored by the Center for
Human Development entitled “How
to Figure Out What You Want to Be
When You Grow Up," Bates out-
lined her approach to_ finding the
right job for your personality type.

“So many people today are dissat-
isfied because they haven‘t found a
career that is fulfilling,” Bates said.
“Myjob is to build bridges between
people’s pain and their potential.”

Bates uses the psychological
appraoch of right- vs. left-brain
dominance to explain why some
people are happy in certain kinds of
jobs and others are not.

“Left-brain people are most com-
fortable in very structured, organ-
ized situations," she explained.
“They tend to be excessively neat
and will finish each project that they
start. A left-brain person works best
with numbers and symbols and will
attack projects in a logical 1-2-3

if order. He retains information best if

it is given to him verbally.”

Bates explained that right- or left-
brain dominance can be revealed
through a person’s physical appear-
ance as well as through the structure
of his psyche. A left—brain person,
she said, is -often tall and angular,
with a straight, slender posture. The

. right side of his face may be slightly

swelled or more developed than the
left side, caused by the fact that the
left hemisphere ofthe brain controls
the right side of the body. The
reverse is true for the dominant
right-brain individual, whom Bates
described as “messy.”

“Right-brain people are impul-
sive,” she said. “They live for the
moment. Rules, regulations and pre-
cise organization stifle the right-
brain person, who prefers working
with abstract ideas and concepts
rather than words and numbers. A

dominant right brain governs the
person who has many unfinished
projects in the works simultane-
ously, the person who can be over-
whelmed by the whole mountain ot
work ahead of him unable to break it
into sequential steps."

Bates went on to explain the dis-
satisfaction and difficulty that right-

brain people experience in a society.

that caters to the organized, left-
brain individual. She cited statistics
taken from a series of IQ tests given
to a group of right-brain dominant
children as part of a Harvard Uni-
versity study. The first set of tests
was administered to the children
while they were seated upright at
desks, and the second set while they
were lying down. Scores were 30 per-
cent higher in the second set of tests.

“Right-brain people may find that
they study or work better lying down
or moving around,” Bates
explained. “They might prefer to
listen to music while they work. A
right-brain person retains informa-
tion best if he can experience it
somehow, see it or touch it. Thus he
achieves better understanding by
reading as opposed to listening."

Some people find themselves in
the middle of the spectrum, accord-
ing to Bates, possessing both left-
brain and right-brain dominant
traits. These people fall into two
main categories: laterally balanced
individuals and mixed dominant
individuals or alternators.

“A laterally balanced person pos-
sesses a harmonious combination of
left— and right-brain dominant char-
acteristics,” Bates explained. “The
left brain leads off in situations that
require logic or organization, and
the right brainvtakes over when
abstract or creative thinking is
required. Alternators experience a
kind of tug-of—wai'. They are left—
brain dominant sometimes and
right-brain dominant at other times.

An alternator may experience a.

stagnant feeling of immobilization
when his left and right brain tenden-
cies obstruct each other - a kind of

mental block."

It is possible to adjust yourself to
your career choice once you have
determined your own left— or right-
brain nature, Bates said.

“A right-brain dominant girl was
flunking her college pre-med courses
until it was suggested to her to attach
a book rack to her exercise bicycle,”
Bates said. “Now she rides while she
reads, and she’s on the dean’s list."

Bates uses the example of her own
life as an illustration of how under-
standing your own right- or left-
brain tendencies can help you take
action in choosing the right career.

“I tried social work and public
relations. I took assertiveness train-

ing five times. I tried everything, but
then I stopped trying to perfect
myself, and I stopped saying, ‘My
life will be just right when  ‘l real-
ized that my life will be over beforel
ever achieve that kind of goal.”

Bates’ program of action consists
of identifying the things you love to
do, determining how much money
you would like to earn doing them,
establishing steps to take toward
achieving the goal and making a
commitment to yourself that you
will take those steps.

“You’re not going to learn any-
thing by sitting in your living room.
Go on interviews. Meet people in the
field you’re considering. Most fields

JULY IO, I985

are broad and can accomodate both
right- and left—brain dominant indi-
viduals. Prepare yourself. You can
do a job that you aren’t happy in if
you feel that it can be a stepping
stone to the job you want.”

Taking advice from friends who
see our strengths and weaknesses is
important, too, according to Bates.
But central to the career decision
process is our own self-confidence.

“I don’t have to feel that I mustdo
only one thing for the rest of my
life,” Bates said. “I have the freedom
to choose, the freedom to change. I
can trust myself to make decisions
that are right for me.”

Pitt band director ncimed

O’Neill Sanford, director of the
University of Minnesota marching
band for the past nine years, has
been named the new director of
bands at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Sanford, who will be responsible
for the marching, concert and pep
bands at Pitt, brings with him a
strong musical background and a
national reputation for building the
Minnesota marching band into one
of the most exciting in the country.
His style at Minnesota combined
precision marching and innovative
patterns with a ﬂair for showman-

"ship and entertainment.

I His halftime shows there have
been called innovative and varied,
appealing to both musicians and the
general audience.\ Additionally, he is
considered an outstanding arranger
who writes nearly all the musical
arrangements for his bands.

Coming with Sanford from Min-
nesota to Pitt will be his assistant
director, David May.

“We are extremely pleased to have
hired O’NeiIl to be our new director

of bands,” Pitt athletic director
Edward E. Bozik said in making the
announcement. “He comes ‘to us
highly recommended by music peo-
ple from across the country._l am
confident he will bring a high degree
of excitement and professionalism
to our various band programs and
revitalize and energize our musical
organization. By the naming of
O’Neill, we have made a commit-
ment to a first-class band program,
and I urge all our supporters tojoin
in this effort.”

In addition to being director of
the marching and pep bands at the
University of Minnesota since 1975,
Sanford served as Symphonic and
Jazz Ensemble ll director and asso-
ciate director of bands as well. Dur-
ing he tenure he has revitalized the
Minnesota band programs in a
number of areas, including taking
the. marching band on tours of
Spain, Mexico and Great Britain.
His annual, indoor concerts of the
marching band have drawn sellout
crowds of over 4,000 people for
three consecutive nights, and he has

annually sold out the band records
and tapes.

Sanford replaces Donald Hower
who resigned his position this past
spring after 13 years at Pitt.- The new
appointment is effective immediate-
y.

Education
in the
Far East

This is a journal account from
.lames R. Ross, assistant professor
1n_the Writing Program, who, along
with Professor Anthony Petrosk y, is
teaching journalism this summer to
English-speaking students at the
Shanghai Foreign Languages
Institute.

June 12:

We‘ arrived in Shanghai about
three days late, setting off some
minor worrying at the institute and a
near panic back in Pittsburgh. We
couldn’t get a ﬂight out of Kunming
until today, so we extended our 10-
day trip through the countryside and
visited Dali. Its a beautiful, isolated
small town in the mountains, ll tor-
turous hours by bus from Kunming,
populated by minority people in
colorful costumes. Capitalism is on
its way —- a new hotel and airport

are being built —— but for now it’s_

relatively serene. It is a long way
from Shanghai and has 13 million
people, millions of bicycles, thou-
sands of packed trolleys and buses
and a few crazed car and taxi drivers
honking ~hopelessly through the
maze I of pedestrians and ﬂying
Pigeon bikes.

We start our visit with a meeting
— meetings are endemic in China -—
to discuss revising our course sche-
dule now that we’ve lost a few days.
The attitude is “Mei guanxi” (no
problem). It has to be that way."
Nothing is easy, from getting plane
tickets to finding breakfast. And if
you fight against the East wind, it’s
likely to blow you back to Pitts-
burgh. Or farther.

But even the most difficult things
are wonderful. In our first two

weeks, we drank beer and took pic-'

tures with some Cantonese chicken
farmers (whose only English was
“Hello” and “OK") at the Yan Yan
Restaurant and played ping-pong
with some young Chinese in a park
in Canton; climbed a mountain to
see l.300-year-old Buddhist tem-
ples; watched an Australian wind-
surf on Lake Dian; drank tea with a
country farmer who understood my
Mandarin and ate Yunnan over-the-
bridge noodles in Kunming; chatted
with a Chinese-speaking parrot and
negotiated over brass locks and
silver rings in Dali. On the way back,
we entertained the Chinese in our
minibus with a Beatles cassette. No
reaction when John sings: “lfyou go
carrying pictures of Chairman Mao,
you ain’t gonna make it with anyone
anyhow.” I didn’t try to translate.
They‘d probably agree, though.
The new China is bursting with capi-
talism, from the farmers _who get
‘paid for what they produce to the
little old ladies selling trinkets to
tourists in Suzhou. All the .way from
Dali to Kunming, there are new
houses, schools and factories being
built. Crops are planted everywhere
~— terraced into steep mountains,

- planted near belching power plants

—— and all day, every day, the 800
million people who live on those
farms seem to be seeding rice, clear-
ing weeds with their feet, plowing
with water buffalo and harvesting.

June 13:

The first day of classes was like
any first day. We were nervous and
excited. We introduced ourselves
and then asked the students to talk.
A few use their English names:
David, Juliette, Mollie. They seem
smart and tough. A few are bold
enough to let us know they don’t
have any choice about their careers
— the state wants them to be jour-
nalists. They‘re in the fourth year of
a six-year college program and then

    

they'll take jobs with Radio Beijing
or television or maybe with the for-
eign affairs ministry. They don't
seem bitter and are probably quite
fortunate now that intellectuals are
back in favor.

The school gave us a big office for
justthe two of us (there are normally
four or five teachers to an office) and
is arranging tours, tickets and a pri-
vate car when we need it. Foreigners
get special treatment, partly because
the Chinese know how ill-prepared
we are for the jostling of everyday
life and partly because they’re quite
proud of their country and want to
show us its best side.

June 14:

Spent this morning’s lecture com-
peting with a cement mixer outside.
For lunch, a l0-course banquet with
the English department chairman.
We talked about some strange phe-
nomena in America, like MTV, and
about where China may be heading.
China seems a bit like a post-war
U.S., growing fast with no fear ofthe
future.

We‘re trying several things in
classes that these students haven’t
done before, like writing workshops
and team teaching. They adapt
quickly. Today "we handed out some
American‘ newspapers. None of
them had seen the New York Times,
Wall Street Journal, USA Today or
The New York Daily News. They

read them voraciously. Our copy of i

the Weekly World News (“Hubby
Used AIDS Victim to Seduce Cheat-
ing Wife”) got the most attention.

We also discovered that meeting
informally in small groups makes
discussions much easier. The stu-
dents had dozens of questions for
Tony and me about television, inves-
tigative reporting and feature writ-
ing. They're alsosquite open to seeing
the biases in the Chinese media, how
it glosses over or ignores bad news,
often burying the most important
facts in a “However” paragraph two-
thirds of the way into a story.

We and they made it through a
three-and-a-half hour class on a hot
day without much grumbling. But
there were times, as. Tony waded
through the classroom trying to get
someone to talk, that it seemed a lot
like Basic Reading and Writing.

and Avenue Edward VII, and the
French used Vietnamese. troops to
keep the Chinese in line. The
Parisian-style villas and mansions
are now crowded apartments and
government offices, and the streets
are named after Chinese cities and
provinces. We wake up each morn-
ing to the sounds of people exercis-
ing along Maoming Lu —- old men
with graceful tai chi movements,
large groups stretching and breath-
ing in unison, and one rather vocal
karate enthusiast who begins yelling
“Hai!” at about 6:30. Food markets
are nearby and there are restaurants,
bakeries, clothing stores (not much
for big Americans) and other shops
along Huahai Lu.

June 16:

Classes the last two days have
been hard work but still fun. The
students seem more and more like
American students — the girls sit in
front and the boys in the back, they
giggle and talk to each other, and
they’re often afraid to speak out in
class.

l’m impressed by their wide
knowledge of American history.
They seem to know as much about
the founding fathers and Watergate
as most American students. lt’s
remarkable, too, because so mu_ch
has to be learned by rote and only
the brightest students —— starting in
the primary grades — have access to
the libraries.

Center.

June 18:

Went to the American consulate
today to borrow a videocassette
recorder. The Chinese VCR at
school runs at a different speed and
won’t play the news and documen-
tary tapes we recorded in the_ U.S.
The Americans at the consulate
aren’t real friendly, but one of the
Chinese officials working there
teaches at the institute and is quite
helpful. The only problem is voltage
conversion — all of China runs on
220 volts, but the consulate runs on
good old American H0. The consu-
late sends a Chinese technician to
make the adjustments. I

We’re fitting into the routine and
rhythm this week. Its nice to be in
the samegspot for a while. The stu-

dents are still eager and attentive, _

particularly now that they know
we’re not getting paid for this
(they’re staying in school an extra
week and a half to_complete our
csurse).

The students got a kick out of our
TV news videotapes, especially the
commercials for Oil of Olay, Special
K, Metamusil and Preparation H.
American TV seems pretty funny.
Seeing pictures of Reagan on the
news was even more embarrassing,
but the students don't seem to appre-
ciate our irreverence. (Remember,
the Chinese invited Tricky Dick
back here" after he could _barely get
on a talk show in America).

Tonight we went to a Chinese
friend’s home for dinner. The family
-— mother, father, two boys, two
girls — live in a relatively spacious
apartment on the fourth floor in the
outskirts of Shanghai. Our friend’s
father showed us beautiful art
books, bonsai sculpture and paint-
ings. There was real warmth within
the family and toward us. And the
I8-course banquet — everything
from duck to eel —— was the best
Chinese meal we’ve ever had or
imagined.

The affection among friends and
families seems special here. Boys
walk down the street with their arms
around each other, girls hold hands
even in classes, and mothers and
fathers dote lovingly on their beauti-
ful, mellow children.

Two students took us to the Shao
Hsing Opera tonight, a southern
version of the Beijing Opera, in

-which females play all the roles

instead of males. The costumes, sets
and noisy audience made for quite a
spectacle. We saw “Hua Long Dian
Jin,” an opera about a rebellious
intellectual and the emperor’s efforts
to recruit talented people. Such op-
eras weren't a big hit during the Cul-
tural Revolution, but the current
fascination for third-rate Western

music here may do more damage to ,

traditional Chinese culture than a
battalion of Red Guards. This opera
seemed appropriate, however, now
that Den Xiaoping has once again
welcomed intellectuals into
government.

June 21:

This was a very strange day. Spent
most of the afternoon in a film-
dubbing studio and, after hours of
introductions and propaganda, got
a chance to see an American film
dubbed (very well) in Chinese. We
thought our host said the film was
“First Flight," but when the lights
went out, there was Sly Stallone as
Rambo, blowing up most of the
Pacific Northwest. We couldn‘t
decide if this was more a comment
on the Chinese taste for violent films

It’s the start ofthe Summer Festi-
val today, and people are selling
ornaments with tigers and hearts to
ward off the heat. The temperature
hasn’t changed much but the cloth-
ing has. Shanghai natives had been
wearing layers of clothing before
today, but now shorts and shirts-
leeves and parasols are everywhere.

We walked down the legendary
Nanjing Lu for dinner. It’s the shop-
ping center for a ,city full of
shoppers. The streets, sidewalks and
buses were a mass of humanity.

Student's artwork displayed

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer 8

Thomas Papadakos calls himself
“A middle-class American person
producing middle-class American
art.” This week the Pitt Program
Council is sponsoring Papadakos’
first public showing of his paintings.

Papadakos, a student at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, has been inter-
ested in art since he was seven years
old; however, it wasn‘t unitl a year
ago that he began painting seriously.
Calling this his “first major project,”
Papadakos has l4 paintings on dis-
play on the main floor of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.

Papadakos, multi-media ‘artist,
uses photography to create images
that are both startling and pleasing
to the eye. By taking pictures and
then enlarging and coloring them,
Papadakos creates surreal moods
and textures that can be best de-
scribed as immpressionistic or
abstract.

Responding to criticism about the
validity of abstract art Papadakos
said, “Although some of the tech-
niques to create my art seem simple,
talking about creating a painting
and actually doing it are two differ-
ent things. The people that criticize
my work or abstract painting should
try to create their own work.”

Papadakos’ work is influenced by

Prof 1

was co—chairman of an international
panel studying the stratosphere.

Although Kaufman never
received an undergraduate-degree,
he received his doctorate from J.ohns
Hopkins University in Baltimore.
He came to the United States in
l94l , settled in Baltimore andbegan
his studies at Johns Hopkins, from
where he graduated in l948. _

Kaufman was a member of the
American Chemical Society and
Sigma Xi, an honorary fraternity,

and had been president of the Com-
bustion lnstitute. '
Kaufman’s family  wife Klari
Simonye Kaufman, sons Michael S.
Kaufman of New York and Roy H.

other artists —— notably Jackson
Modrian and Kandinski -— how-
ever, even though some of their ele-
ments of style show up in
papadakos’ paintings, Papadakos
said “I make my“own imprint on my
work.”

Although Papadakos titles his
own work, he encouraged people
who view his paintings to come away
with their own impressions about
what the paintings represent.-Before
the exhibit. Papadakos has shown
his paintings to friends to gauge
their reactions. Encouraged by their
response, he said he was confident
and pleased by the turnout at the
exhibit so far. “So far we had 30
people register their names and
about 20 more just walk in and
browse about.”

Papadakos, who plans to make
art and painting a lifelong occupa-
tion; jokes, ‘*1 don’t want to be rich
and famous, ljust want to be rich."
He quickly added that if people
bought and enjoyed his work he
would be satisfied, “I just want to
have enough money to live on, and
have a place to paint.

Papadakos hopes that having the
art exhibit will increase his chances

of success in the art community.’

“There seem to be a couple of art
galleries that are receptive to my
work, so that’s encouraging."

The art exhibit can be seen at the
William Pitt Gallery until July 12,
from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m.

JULY io, 1985”

Liver transplant hypocrisy

The Fourth of.Iuly is over, and all
the picnics, block parties and fire-
works always remind you of how
great it is to be an American. I
believe that for 200 years America
has been and continues to be the
greatest country in the world
because of our love of freedom and
our drive to push society and
humankind ahead, just because
these are the right things to do. A
quite separate thing, however, is the
uneasy trend that a foreign poet at
the Three Rivers Arts Festival noted
and called a “slightly stupid
nationalism.”

I’m talking about the way some
people got that crazed Iranian look
in their eyes as they yelled “USA,
USA!" at the Olympics. Sure, I
rooted for our team, just because
they were our guys, not because
“Americans are superior,” etc. It is
terribly discouraging to see the same
hurtful, almost redneck fanaticism
in the lynch mob that is circling
around our hospitals at Pitt calling,
“No transplants for foreignersiuntil
every waiting American patient gets
one!”

Make no mistake about it, with
only a small portion of the needed
donor organs available, what this
means is an end to all transplants to
foreigners. These proposals go
beyond an ugly “nationalism” to a
meanness and coldness that is
entirely against the American spirit.

I have ‘tad the great opportunity

Dirk Kaufman

to do volunteer work in the Intensive
Care Unit at Pres-by. Often in the
SICU there are patients from all
around the world. Their skins, their
languages and behaviors, sometimes
even the way they cry are different.
Sometimes it may look as ifthey are
smiling while tears are rolling down
their face in pain and confusion. But
they are all the same —~ they are all
warm, living, feeling people.

Now, I hate as much or more than
anyone to see organs going to
wealthy oil sheiks just because they
have the money. That is a crime we
have to fight against, probably even
legislate against. The commerical
buying or selling of a donor kidney,
for example, must be outright and
explicitly forbidden by international
law. But if you call “Transplants
only for Americans!”, are you going
to rule out the little Irish boy whose
whole town saved up to send him to
America for a lifesaving liver
transplant?

It hurts me and is embarrassing to
me to hear this kind of hardness.
Ireland, like many foreign countries,
does not have a liver transplant pro-
gram. If two people are dying, how‘
can anyone say one person is more
deserving, just because he is an
American? This is why you need the
human element in choosing recip-
ients. Internal and external regula-
tion are important to guard against
abuses.

Of course I want most of the
transplants done here to go to my
home country. Now there are about
20 centers doing liver transplants in
the U.S., but just a few years ago,
this was the only place to go for a
liver. If local economic responsibili-
ties were to be considered a factor,
would anyone seriously have asked
then, “Should a Pittsburgh trans-
plant candidate have preference
over someone from West Virginia?"
Of course not.

It can‘t be an entirely clinical or
entirely ethno-geographical deci-
sion. Soon, temporary artificial
heart patients will come here from
all over the country. There is so
much more involved: educating peo-
ple and governments, getting new
procedures developed and accepted
and new centers established. Who
areithese people calling for a mora-
torium on all transplants to foreign-
ers? Mainly it has been people in the
press — reporters and editorialists
—— for this was a non-issue only a few
weeks ago.

If these people would ever have
the chance to see the patients fight-
ing to recover, see the families visit-
ing them like clockwork during
every visitor’s hours, crying and
praying, they would temper their
cold edicts with human compassion,
instead of sounding like Lebanese
hijackers calling for the exclusion of
all foreigners.

Capturing life in brief review

Part of the training a student-
journalist must attend to involves
writing in a certain form and style. A
news story must contain certain ele-
ments: who, what, when, where,
why. A sports story, the fast-paced
anecdote from competition.

Perhaps one of the more difficult
pieces to construct for the reader is
the obituary. How does one capture

Depending on performance, an MIT could be a store manager in six I all the events of a lifetime, any life-

time, in a manner which will most
reflect the good and bad in human
existence?

The fact is, one cannot capture the
total beauty of life in words. Many

try, and many come close. But it is, I
think, a pursuit that might best be
left alone. -

In the broadest sense, journalism
has dropped this pursuit. In review-
ing the life of one deceased, there is a
checklist of items to cover. You’ve
seen them. Each day lives are
reviewed in print in memory ofthose
now gone. The information is differ-
ent, but the format is the same.

I suppose I say all this because
today this newspaper reviewed the
life of a man. Though it was in cor-
rect form and content, it was only a

scant review. Though I know this is »

what we must do, I still feel obli-
gated to say a little more. And so I
give you this: R

Dr. Frederick Kaufman loved to
profess the knowledge of chemistry.
For all that he had accomplished in
his field, he loved the science and he
loved sharing it with the students of
this university.

I know this through the eyes and
voices of his colleagues. When your
love of something moves beyond
you and extends itself to those
around you, it is a very fine thing.
Dr. Kaufman felt this love and
should be" remembered for it.

Costa-Gavras brings

terrorism problem to reality.

8;?’ Rose Burke

Through the hostages in Bei-
rut, Americans got acquainted
with political terrorism. News-
papers and television , docu-
mented the suspense, the human
drama and the complicity of
government officials.

In much the same way, film
director Constatin Costa-
Ggvras makes political terrorism
real for his audience. Showing
Fridays at Carnegie Institute is a
series of his films that attempt to
make terrorism understandable,
human and even popular.

But the director, however, is
not so understandable as to be
banal, so human as to be sickly
sentimental or so popular to be
trite. Last week’s film, Z, is a
god example of his style. It tells
how a group of simple Greek
workers kill Gregory Lambra-
kis, a popular socialist leader.

 Women

light of

The reverberation of closing

‘steel mills and high unemploy-

ment echoes throughout Pitts-
burgh and the. surrounding
areas. However, the specific
problems that face women have
been virtually ignored. The Mon
Valley media group saw a need

30 bring women's issues to the

forefront and produced a televi-
sion ‘documentary entitled
Women of Steel, which will air
on WQED this week.

In 1974, U.S. Steel and eight
other major steel producers
signed an agreement to end dis-
crimination in the mills. This
resolution allowed women to
enter the steel production indus-

try for the first time since World V

War II. Around 1980 women’s
employmentin the mills reached
 peak with approximately
2,000 women producing steel in
the Mon—Ohio valley. Today less
than a dozen women are
employed in the remaining mills.

Women of Steel tells the story
of three women — Sheryl John-

‘ son, Patty Turnell and Sherrie

Ortallona — who struggled for
equality before, during and after
their steel" working experiences.

The women (two white and
one black) were single parents
trying to eke out a living for their
families before they went to
work in the mills. After being
employed in the steel industry,
they were able to insure proper
health care and provide school-
ing, entertainment and security
for their families.

However, a struggle still
gxisted in the workplace because
many of the men in the mills re-
sented the presence ‘of women.

Based on the real account of his

assasination in 1963, this film
unfolds the involvement of the
reactionary police and corrupt
government officials in Lambra-
kis’ murder.

Although the audience knows
the identity of the murderers, the
truth hides unrevealed until the
special prosecutor arrives. With
his dark sunglasses helping to
hide emotion, the prosecutor
becomes the symbol of objectiv-
ity and justice. But will the law
prevail? _

The popularity of Z, which
received an Academy Award for
best foreign film, lies in the fast-
paced conflict: the chase scenes,
the pressing crowd, clashes with
police. It also involves personal
drama; the pressing and obnox-
ious journalist, the mourning
widow, theireluctant witness.

These elements also contrib-
uted to the box-office success of

of Steel captures  
women inindustry

The new mill ‘workers had to__.

fight to win respect. By the time
they gained a foothold into the
industry, though, the bottom
dropped, out. Before women
steel workers knew what hit
them, they were unemployed
and the benefits were quickly
running out. They were right
back where they started: in low
paying jobs with no benefits.
The experiences of these
women and other mill workers
are woven together in a collage
of news clips, bar scenes, mill
footage and home settings. The
sound track Women in Steel,
written by Stanley Richardson,

V captures the essence of the story.

Randy Strothman, of the Uni-

versity Center for Instructional ,

another Costa—Gavras film,
Missing. Starring Sissy Spacek
and Jack Lemmon, this film, like
the others in the series, is based
on a true incident. But unlike the
others, it tells of the disappear-

ance — not murder ~— of an
American writer in South
America.

Perhaps these films are evi-
dence that Costa-Gavras goes
beyond journalism. He uses new
techniques to capture a classic
tale. He combines the documen-
tation of investigative journal-
ism but predates the current U.S.
preoccupation with terrorism.

This Friday The Confession
will be showing at Carnegie
Institute. State of Siege shows
on July l9. Missing, the final
film of the series, shows on July
26. All films begin at 8 p.m.

Classic comedy
reasserts itsell  

By Leslie M. Bennett

Sha-la-la and da-de-do—wah
appear to be the food of love in

this bubbly musical production -

of Twelfth Night as the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival
“plays on.” Director Gillette
Elvgren combines his own fresh
invention with Henry Hey-
mann’s whimsical set design and

Russell Walker’s score of toe-_

tapping melodies, creating an
animated interpretations as lov-

able as any Disney cartoon. This ‘

play is downright fun.

Playing on the universal
comic themes of mismatched
love, mistaken identity and sex
reversals, the play transcends all
contexts of time and place.*Illy—
ria, the never-never land where

‘twins Sebastian and Viola find

themselves shipwrecked and
separated, and where Duke

' Orsino and Countess Olivia ride '
a romantic carrousel, is wonder-

fully illustrated on stage with
ﬂowery colors reminiscent of
1960s psychedelia. But the pro-
duction does as well as the play
in not dating itself. '

Even the costumes do not
reveal any consistent time frame,
but exaggerate only the individ-
ual characters themselves. While
Olivia’s uncle Sir Toby Belch is
-“roundly” clad as a ‘ bright
orange puss-in-boots, her maid
servant Maria donning ruffles
and net stockings, looks more
like a Parisian dance hall girl.
Likewise, Olivia‘s puritannical
steward Malvolio is in unmistak-
able pilgrim attire, complete

with white bib, buckled shoes "

and painted frown. Meanwhile,
everyone in the lovesick Orsino's
court wears tights and tunics
with red heart insignia.

Above all else, Henry Hey-
mann commands attention with
his scenery and properties which
seem to become animated char-
acters themselves, using actors
for mechanization. There are
two rotating columns, spun for
scene changes adding to the
merry-go-round spirit of the
play‘s action. The single set has
plenty of moving parts which are
carried on and off stage with
ingenious comic flair. Two

‘Andrew and Fabian w

actors hold saloon doors while
Toby and his entourage swing
through them. Bored members
of Orsino’s court toss out a heart
shaped bed along with a life sized
doll dressed in a wedding gown.
The three merry men —— Toby,
hide
behind and carrysabout a two-
dimensional “box tree” (which
blossoms gift wrapped boxes)
while deceiving poor Malvolio.
And Feste, the pivotal and ‘saga-
cious clown, hauls around a
"trunk from which all disguise
and trickery seem to come.

Performances are, without
exception, delightful making it a
difficult task to highlight anyone
in particular. A ﬂawless orator,
Don Wadsworth, captures the
proud but quirky nature of Duke
Orsino. Helena Ruoti as Viola is
the leading lady in the role of the
leading man Cesario. Her per-

formance ‘is nothing less than

outstanding.
Monique Morgan’s coy pout-
ing as Olivia and Kelly Maurer’s

‘witty flirtations as her maidser-

vant, Maria, are consistently
humorous. Without doubt how-
ever, the loudest uproar comes
when the prune-faced Malvolio
(Alexander Cook) goes into var-
ious hilarious contortions to

achieve a smile for the affections ’

of his mistress, Olivia. When the
audience roars with his triumph,
Cook glares andpoints in pious
condemnation.

The world of Illyria is not all
light and lively, as is revealed in
this production through Feste,
poignantly portrayed" by Mark
Easton Gruber. It is the fool’s
troublesome responsibility to
balance the real against the
unreal by carefully observing the
disguises and deceptions around
him. It could be argued that
Gruber was cast as Feste purely
for his talented singing ability.
Certainly, the fool’s voice
becomes a device which takes the
play forward invoking a spirit of
fun and frivolity as well as an
underlying query of darkness
and possibly madness. Gruber,
however, not only lends a power-
ful voice, but a powerful pres-
ence as well.

ALBERT COLLINS AND
THE ICEBREAKERS

The Decade

July 8, 1985

ldolatrous local musicians,
college boys in Adidas shirts and
a group of die-hard blues fans all
gathered at the Decade Monday
night to catch Albert Collins —
“Master of the Telecaster” —
purportedly the best blues
guitarist alive today.

A progeny of blues legend
Sam Lightnin’ Hopkins, Collins,
52, has been a major inﬂuence on
everyone from Eric Clapton to
Stevie Ray Vaughn, yet for the
first ten years of this career he
was gigging in relative obscurity
in and around his native city of

in Austin, Tex.

Collins’ “break” came in 1969
when the white blues band
Canned Heat saw him playing in
a Houston nightclub and asked
him to join their tour. Soon he
was jamming with the likes of
Ike and Tina Turner and estab-
lishing a cult following among
’60s rock stars and some oftheir
more esoteric fans.

He still has a sizeable follow-
ing today, but aside from people
who play guitar themselves or
are die-hard blues fanatics, not

too many people know who

Albert Collins is. While this is
unfortunate for Collins and his
band, the lcebreakers, it is lucky,
for you, because when they visit
Pittsburgh you can see them at a
small club like the Decade for
only six bucks and get more than
your money’s worth.

Like many collegiate rock
buffs, this reviewer has always
liked blues but never had more

than a general knowledge of it.
The first time I ever went to a
blues show was last February
when Collins played the Decade.
I was so pleased by Collins and
his band that I went to see them
again.

An evening with Albert Col-
lins is filled with more emotion,
spontaneity and energy than you
will find at almost any rock con-
cert. You can go to a rock show,
hear favorite and familiar songs
and enjoy a few moments of
quick intensity, but most likely
your attention will wax and
wane. At a good blues show, the
music will engross you from start
to finish, and you get a chance to
observe the interplay between
musicians who, if they’re good,
will never play the notes you
expected them to play. Yet,
somehow, those notes are the
very ones that you wanted to
hear. At the onset of Collins’
show, people began rocking
back and forth in their seats as if
they couldn’t help themselves,
and by the end of the evening
almost halfthe audience was out
on the dance floor having a great
time and looking as if they were
trying to feel every bass line and
drum beat as they moved.
Dancers did not just sway aim-
lessly but rather seemed truly, if
awkwardly, inspired.

It’s inspiration, I guess, that
compelled Albert Collins to
leave the Decade stage during
the middle of a song and do a
Chuck Berry duck walk over to
the lounge. Here, he played gui-
tar while standing on top of the
bar and actually walked outside
to perform in front of an amazed

$ good listener, you can pick up on

and responsive group of pedes-
trians hanging out on a nearby
street corner. A policevan drove
by, stopped, and Collins played
for the officers before coming
back in to the club.

Collins plays to his audience
as if he were talking to them. He
grins, frowns and opens his
mouth in mock wonderment
during guitar solos. Certain
chords sound like musical punc-
tuation; you can almost hear
commas, question marks and
exclamation points.‘ He’ll sing
lines like, They cut my lights off
this mornin’, threw myfurniture
out the door, and then play a few
conversational notes as if to fur-
thur emphasize his surprise and
dejection. This is how the blues
are supposed to sound, but hear-
ing them on an old Yardbirds
album and seeing real blues play-
ers live are two different things.

and mingled with the crowd
between them. During the
second set, local bluesman Billy
Price got up on stage to sing, and
another local musician named
Stokehouse “Skinny Girl” John-
son emerged from the audience
to jam with Collins on rhythm
guitar. Collins didn’t announce

them you’d have to have heard
them a few times before. I never
had, but his made no difference
because I enjoyed the show any-
way. At 2:30 a.m. Collins left the
stage after performing an encore
and told the audience that he

“appreciated being in Pitts-
burgh.” Then he left, the muggy
night made considerably mugg-
ier from Collins and tin:
lcebreakers.

CARRIE STETLER

To be a good blues musi-
cian you have to have suf-
fered and you have to have
gotten around. The lcebreak-
ers have done a lot of both so
they can tell you many hard-
luck stories and some inter-
esting bits of gossip about

_ Tina Turner.

Saxophonist Aboo Locke
left his family in Arkansas
when he was only fifteen to
play clubs in Memphis. He
has picked cotton, starved
and eaten out of a garbage
can. You can probably play
the blues if you’re content and
well—fed, but to really feel
them and play them you have
to have been very hungry and
very miserable. He has played
with Muddy Waters and_
Howlin’ Wolf which makes
him well-qualified.

Keyboardist Leon Blue

tells fewer hard luck stories
than Locke. He wears a large
turqoise and silver bracelet
given to him by Tina Turner
when he played with the Ike
and Tina Turner Revue in
l966. This was the year Ike
and Tina opened for the R01-
ling Stones. Blue has met
Mick Jagger and thinks he’s
“real nice.” He also men-
tioned that his son Leon Blue
Jr. plays bass with Shalamar.

Richardson had sort of a
love/hate relationship with
Ike Turner. “He was a good
person, but he could be real
nasty and really rude, usually
when he didn’t get enough "
sleep. He used to get on ‘my
nerves some times.” .

While Ike couldbe a real
ogre on the road, Richardson
said Tina Turner was always
“a very lovely lady. Tina’s
been overdue for years. She’s
making it now because she’s
doing what she wants to do.
Before she had to do what lke

wanted her to do and she‘ "-

didn’t feel it.” Does Richard-
son feel at all bitter when he
considers that Tina Turner is
a millionaire while he is play-
ing gigs at the Decade?

“No, I feel so good knowin’
her the way I did,” he replies
sincerely. “Every time I see
her on TV I say “Oh god 
how great.”

Richardson has toured
with the Stones (while with
Ike and Tina), and the Yard-
birds, and played with John
Mayall. He alsothinks the
Stones are “real nice.”

Police-man proves

THE DREAM OF THE BLUE
TURTLES
Sﬁng

:fA & M Records

Barring any Police albums
until the late fall, Sting’s The
Dream of the Blue Turtles is the
next best thing. The lead singer/
songwriter of. the Police shows
that even at his most pompous,
he can still be invigorating.

For example, in the lyrics of
the chart-riding “If You Love
Somebody (Set Them Free),” we

“are rolledby the sentiment that
" “Everything we see we want to__

possess” -—— only to be told that
of holding onto somebody is
what you (come on, humor me)
are interested in, Sting wants no
part of it! The tune succeeds
(despite its paranoid, conceited
world view), while a rocking
wash of churchy organ, tambou-
rine and soulful backup vocals
make this" somewhat familiar

{dichotomy of urgent music and

noncommitted, self-important
lyrics fight to the finish.

The record is a mish-mash of
Police-sounding music
known for its searing clatter and
world weariness kept on this side
of smirkiness through the tight,
intuitive musicianship of the
band. By slim contrast, Sting’s
ensemble is made up of young,
energetic players from contem-

 porary jazz music with freer, yet

no less demanding dynamics.
The enterprising saxophonist
Branfo_rd Marsalis (brother of
jazz trumpeter Wynton), key-
boardist Kenny Kirkland (also
from Wynton Marsalis Quintet),
Omar Hakim (drummer with
Weather Report) and bassist

1'Darryl Jones (who has played

most recently with Miles Davis)
all contribute to the B-plus suc-
cess of this “solo” effort. These
guys aren’t out of their element,
even though one cannot call this
album 2_1 jazz_ record. The Dream
of the Blue Turtles is definitely a
hybrid of pop and jazz with the
most interesting musical work
going on in the counterpunching

between Sting’s melodies and.

rhythms and the band’s oft-
inspired soloing and support,
especially between Sting and

Branford Marsalis. .
“Love is the Seventh Wave” IS

a light, whimsical crime of
rhyme set to a choppy regae
rhythm. lt’s danceable but no
more notable than, say, “I Just
Called (To Say I Love You).” In
“Moon Over Bourbon Street,”
Sting sings about the foibles and

~ g follies of being a vampire in New
' Orleans.

The political concerns of
nuclear disarmament and the
rights of British miners are
expressed with terse, poetic
songs with bleak and remarka-
bly “Sting-ing” comments on
society forgetting its most valua-
ble component: people. In “Rus-
sians," Sting borrows music

*2 from Prokofiev to effect a dark,

ringing carousel-like music with-
out sympathy, fronted by lines
like, How can I protect my little
boy from Oppenheimeris deadly

toy?/ 'Ihere is no monopoly o-n '

common sense on either side of
the political fence / We share the
same biology. regardless of
ideology. “We Work the Black
Seam” pushes in small, deliber-
ate steps and makes clear that
replacing fossil fuels and man-
power for nuclear energy may
offer less benefits than Prime
Minister Thatcher or the world
has, thus far, hoped to achieve.

“Consider Me Gone” is a jazz
shuffle, a mood piece that rises
up long enough to doo—bee-_doo
in loud whispers and scoot ‘away
as swiftly as it came. High points
on this album are definitely
found in the rip-roaring remake
of “Shadows in the Rain” from
the Police’s Zenyatta Mondatta

1p, in which high speed rhythm
guitar licks by Sting are rocked
along by the rest of the band,
making for refreshing manic
music from the more specific cri-
tiques of gloom and doom that
Sting brings ,to the listener’s
attention. The whirlwind bom-
bast and elegiac air of “Fortress

‘ ""1.-ficv‘.-‘I’ W41 i #5‘: D r‘ !.7\

ENTERTAINMENT/TE-llif ‘PITT i\iE\/‘C/‘s vi\2EEl€L‘Y/i5Ab'E"9

Around Your Heart” is some-
thing to behold, since it sings, as
Sting does, with the typical
Police motif of darkness before a
fall: I’ recognized the walls that I
once made/ I had to stop in my
tracks for fear of walking on the
mines I'd laid. Finally, the title
track is pure jazz mimicry that

pomposity can be invigorating

acts as something of a coda for
this record —— its skips and seats
and sounds very much like a
short session of late ’50s bop
musicians having fun and play-
ing music that musicians can
share without telling the listener
the entire punchline.

AT A THEATRE NEAR YOU

PAGE lO/THE PITT NEWS WEEKLY/SPORTS

By Mark A. Sindler
Special For The Pitt News

(This is the first of a two part series
on whether student-athletes, specifi-
cally football and basketball play-
ers, should be compensated for the
revenue they bring to their respec-
tive schools.) I

In perhaps the darkest period of
its 79-year history, the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association counts

1 many ills that have presently left the

once-proud organization bereft of
dignity.

Trial begins next month for those
charged in a Tulane. basketball

' point-shaving scam while Memphis

State endures an investigation into
its basketball program, said to be
linked with underworld figures.
Steroid use by players is widespread.
lnducements to prospects continue
unchecked. Illegal
student-athletes have been unavoid-
able. Academic transcripts have
been known to be doctored.

The glowering position the
NCAA has either failed to take or
put off indefinitely came last month
during a special convention of Divi-
sion I athletic directors and presi-
dents. Meant to restore integrity to
the beleaguered association, the
convention sent its biggest message

by way of the Death Penalty. Begin-
ning Sept. 1, a school guilty of major

dary violations — twice within a

Gene Corrigan

granted.

Not slated for the agenda during
the two-day meeting was the issue of
compensation for revenue-
producing athletes, notably football

Sports  

and basketball players. Such pro-
posals have been bandied about ever
since the $15-a—month “laundry
money” was banned in 1974. The
forum has been the NCAA’s annual
convention in January.

Support for such a stipend is

expected to come again this January-

in New Orleans. The support,
though, may not be enough to over-
come its detractors. Still, some
NCAA powerbrokers believe the
time is slowly nearing where com-
pensation —.in whatever form —
returns.

Benefits or not, however, the
belief holds. that cheating will never
completely stop.

S. David Berst has been the
NCAA director of enforcement for
eight years and in that office for 13
overall. His office, in concert with
the Committee on Infractions, has
been overseeing the 13 Division I
schools now sanctioned for a variety
of violations.

Nine of those schools, for other
reasons as well, ran afoul of NCAA
bylaws by granting illegal benefits.

“There is an erosion ofintegrity in
athletic programs," Berst said. “A
large part of the answer is for the
president to become involved and
effect control. It is true that athletic
programs have grown in an auto-
nomous manner. But boosters make
it fair to cheat. There are a lot of

well-meaning people saying‘regula-
tions are too cumbersome» and who
provide a rationale for breaking
rules. There are a lot of reasons for
problems. The key to the problems is
for CEOS [chief executive officers]
to establish control and redirect the

Jim Boeheim

program’s emphasis.”

A step toward that direction was
made at last month’s convention.
Besides passing the Death Penalty,

attending members resolved to bring

athletic department budgets under

presidential review, the documents ,

being subject to the CEOs’approval.
Another resolution requires
student-athletes and coaches to sign
affidavits disclosing financial assis-

"tance and athletically-related bene-

fits being received.

_ “I think this is very serious," said
Michigan athletic director Don
Canha‘m. “The greatest thing that
has happened is that the presidents
have woken up. If a president can’t
control it, who the hell can? The vio-
lations are serious, sure, but not to
the point where the situation is
seriously deteriorating in the last
five or six years. The encouraging
thing is presidents are getting

' involved. To emphasize his point,
.Canham claims the $15 million

annual budget he oversees is the
largest of its kind among Division I
institutions.

“Athletic directors never should
have had autonomy anyway,” he‘
continued. “And don’t the faculty
representatives do all the voting‘.’V
Christ, I haven’t voted in years. If
the faculty rep screws up, andthey
have,"then the president should step
in. What the hell kind of faculty guy
is he if his vote isn‘t right?"

only enforce them. Ted C. Tow, as
top assistant to executive director
Walter Byers, has been doing that
for l3 years in his current post.
“My opinion for or against com-
pensation doesn't amount to any-
thing,” Tow said. “We are here as a
staff to do what the membership
wants us to. It has been steadfastly
opposed to go beyond what the rules
currently allow. A survey of presi-

«dents, particularly those’ofI-Ainsti-

tutions, showed no interest
whatsoever, no appreciable interest
of increasing grants to any athletes. I
don’t know of any sizeable group
that advocates that. .

“I certainly wouldn‘t want to pre-
dict what would happen, what
would change or how. But the mood
of the nation, in terms of economy,
is to hold the line. The mood of the
nation is to crack down on integrity,
or the lack of it. Liberalization of
financial aid would be contrary to

that national mood.”

. In the last several years the NCAA
membership has overturned one
bylaw, allowing student-athletes to
work during the summer (they still
may not hold jobs during the school
year), and inflated another, increas-
ing Pell Grant allowances to $900
per year for those athletes on schol-
arship. The maximum Pell grant to
which any student is entitled is
$1,800 annually.

Still, nothing could seemingly
stem the tide of illegal benefits. Per-

” haps the most celebrated in recent

memory was the ticket-selling oper-
ation run by a since-departed assis-
tant football coach from the
University of Southern Caifornia.
From l97l to 1979 he sold compli-
mentary tickets given (four each) to
players at prices exceeding face
value.

Those players choosing to partici-
pate in the arrangement reportedly

».netted $410-$2,000 a year. As a

result, USC is still banned from TV
for one more year after having been
bowl-ineligible the past two.

The University of Florida football
program will be on probation until
January 1988, before which the
school will lose bowl/TV exposure,
10 scholarships per year and other
grant allowances. An NCAA inves-
tigation lasting nearly two years
uncovered ' such improprieties as

‘sales of complimentary tickets, cash

transfers, free room and board for
“unaided” students and an illegal
fund used by former coach Charley
Pell, who resigned in the wake ofthe
investigation’s findings. '
Sanctions for illegal benefits have
figured into the football programs at
Arizona, Kansas, Georgia and Illi-
nois, too. Those basketball schools
permitting illegal benefits include
Georgia, Alaska-Anchorage and

Akron.

Basketball programs at both Bay-
lor and Southern Illinois are said to
be currently under NCAA investiga-
tion. Both respective coaches
resigned this past season for
allegedly making cash payments to
several of their players.

NCAA policy prohibits comment
on ongoing investigations.

Arizona State is also on probation
for granting illegal benefits; its base-
ball, men‘s gymnastics and wrestling
teams having been affected.

Making certain benefits legal is
not necessarily the remedy for ills
brought on by monetary and mate-
rial inducements. Even cries of pov-
erty can go unheeded.

“Let me make clear that cheating
is not borne out of financial need for
student-athletes,” Berst emphasized.
“Cheating comes from how high an
athlete jumps or how fast he can run.
What you can avert is the rationale
of cheating. When cheating occurs,
it’s not because the individual
affected is poor, but that he’s good at
a skill. There are a lot of candidates
to receive automobiles and cash.
They are not necessary cash and cars
if the only criterion is ‘poor.’ "

In January, Gene Corrigan, 57,
will celebrate the fifth anniversary of
his affiliation, by way of athletic
director, with Notre Dame. ‘The
school stands as a benchmark for
sound ethics. More so, Corrigan is
one of the most influential people
within the NCAA.

“Illegal benefits will stop when
you fire the coach and make the
players ineligible,” Corrigan said.
“That’s when it’ll stop. You can put
locks on the doors of the house, but
you can’t stop the burglar from get-
ting in. Unfortunately, among the
Division I ranks, we have some dis-
honest ones.”

Corrigan related, in purposely
vague terms, his phone call one day
to the football coach of a school
“with enough stuff going on that we
didn’t want to play them. He under-
stood and thanked me,” Corrigan
recalled.

“Cheating comes about because
some nut is cheating,” Canham said.
“Then he ‘should get fired. The presi-
dent ought to back up the A.D. in
doing that. Look, you solve the
problem by/firing the cheaters. If the
president cheats, fire him."

“No matter‘ what you do,” Corri-
gan added, “[illegal benefits] will not
stop. There are those who are going
to cheat. You’re not going to cure
the ailment. Some coaches say it
will, but, jeez, some coaches are
dishonest."

To this day the label has not been
affixed to either Jim Boeheim or
Terry Holland, big-time basketball
coaches who win with clockwork
regularity. Boeheim coaches Syra-

SPORTS/THE PITT NEWS WEEKLY/PAGE l l

“Illegal beneﬁts will stop when you fire the
coach and make the players ineligible!”

C orrigan

Notre Dame Athletic Director Gene

cuse and Holland coaches Virginia,
andlboth go about their work hon-
estly — at least outwardly so.

They have also outspokenly made
their intentions known - in diverg-
ing ways.

“As a group, all basketball
coaches would agree that this can
eliminate a lot of the borderline
problems you find today,” Holland
said. “Let’s face it, if I was a profes-
sor on a campus  in fact I was
recently talking to a former one the
other day. Say one of your players, a
member of his family dies. It hurts
not to help that individual get home.
As a professor, this gentleman was
telling me he helped some kids.

“I could never do that. I think
that’s a normal course ofevents fora
basketball player that ’s not available
now.”

Often central to the dispute cen-
tering around scholarship-plus-
benefits is' a fairness doctrine. If
football and basketball players are
paid, then so should the swimmers
and wrestlers and other non—revenue
producing athletes.

Also, difficult to pin down is the
degree to which certain student-
athletes are in need of more finances
than others.

“I’m definitely not in favor ofpay—

Sport Talk  

ing student-athletes," Boeheim said.
“The present rule allowing $900
from the Pell Grant gives you about
$100 a month [during school] and
the big thing is a kid can get a job
during the summer. That's the kind
of thing coaches are looking for.”

Said Holland: “I do understand
the other aspect of collegiate athlet-
ics [the non-revenue producing].
Basketball and football players
should receive compensation. Then
how can you say to a swimmer or a
track athlete who gives just as much
to his or her program that this is not
possible‘? I’m only concerned — and
rightly so — with the day-to-day
events of my basketball team. But
that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t under-
stand the problems athletic directors
and presidents face.”

Added Corrigan: “The cry of pov-
erty for those suffering in poverty
probably isn’t that great. I‘m not one
of those to stand around and fight
about it. Now, the most important
thing is to take care of those with
real need. One of the problems now
is a lot of these youngsters go ‘to
summer school and can’t get a job.
That means no money in the fall.”

Which is when overzealous boo-
sters lend a generous hand.

“I'm a Polly Anna in the sense

Earning a living playing football in college

that you can change the attitude
[that cheating is accepted] and you
can learn in a philosophy course that
it’s not possible to at least modify
attitudes,” Berst said. “I don’t think
[striving for the change] will be
cataclysmic, but it is a starting
point.”

Although Tow steadfastly refuses
to predict future swings in member-
ship sentiments, he isn’t shortsight-
ed, either. . .

“Let’s look at the definition of
what the NCAA calls ‘commonly
accepted educational expenses,’ " he

‘said. “If that were moved out of the

constitution — by a two-thirds
majority of the entire body and to
then be acted separately upon by
each division —— then you could
make the argument that I-A would
change the definition to monthly sti-
pend for student-athletes. Yet only
l7 percent of I-A presidents favor
that, according to a recent survey.”

Of any benefit’s utility, Tow said,
“There‘s no proof that providing
additional stipends eliminates addi-
tional [and illegal] benefits. That
could mitigate some illegalities, but
there’s no proof. I’ve had student-
athletes tell — very respected and
respectable student-athletes — that
we should get back to the incidental
expenses, $10 and $l5 a month, for
athletes who shouldbe getting that
—— the very poor students, who even
if they work during the summer have
a difficult time getting by.”

(In the second part next week,
various plans and ideas aimed at
providing compensation will be
examined, including a proposal by
Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik that
will be voted on during the NCAA’
annual convention this January.)

Pitt announces football promotion

In a period filled with threats to
the city of Pittsburgh by the Pirates,
Spirit and Penguins to leave town
because of attendance problems, the
University of Pittsburgh yesterday
used its (believe it or not) 1984 foot-
ball highlight film to kick off its
most ambitious publicity campaign
ever for the 1985 season.

Aimed at filling the seats at Pitt
stadium, Pitt officials returned to
the rootsof Pitt football since Pitt
teams became regulars in the Top 20

‘during the mid-'70s. Using names I

like Tony Dorsett, Hugh Green,
Dan Marina and Bill Fralic, Pitt has
put together a package that begins
with the highlight film and ends
hopefully with a victory over Penn
State on Nov. 23.

’The ﬂick itself is outstanding.

Touching on the high and_ low points
of the past season, the film projects
the university in a different light
from past highlight films. Instead of
dwelling on the achievements of the
past season (although there weren't
many), the film, titled “Pitt Foot-
ball: A Tradition," hits on the pipe-
line from Pitt to the NFL that has
been established. In a way, Pitt
sports information director Jim
O’Brien made the football program
look better than it did after an ll-l
season.

, Pitt includes the same theme in its
promotion. The big punch is the
giveaways, which will all hit on Dor-
sett, Green, Marina and Fralic. The
first game on Aug. 31 will be Mug
Night, an event in which all adults
will receive a mug featuring the four

The remaining five promotions
will all be aimed at children. The
middle four games of the home sche-
dule will feature promotions in
which the first 6,000 youngsters will
receive a replica game jersey, featur-
ing a different jersey — either Dor-
sett, Green, Marino or Fralic —
each game.

The final game features a poster
giveaway, although they don't even
need a promotion that day: They
host Penn State.
