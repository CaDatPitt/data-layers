City challenges university ’s tax-exempt status

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh is
facing a challenge to its tax-
exempt status of some of the
properties, a move which could
lead to higher tuition or loss of
services for students.

proﬁt activities.

“Seventy percent of the time,
the stadium is used for intramural
sports, physical-education training
and ROTC,” he said. “It’s also
used for other intercollegiate
activities other than football, such
as soccer, track and band.”

in the Cathedral should have
been taxed in the past. “There is
no difference between the [Roy
Rogers] in the Cathedral of
Learning and the one on Forbes
Avenue,” he said. “It should have
been taxed in the past.”

Popper refutes that statement,

located mainly on Oakland
Avenue. Pitt owns the complexes,
which Popper called
“dormitories.”

“The university doesn't have
enough dormitory space and must
turn away some students [who]
seek housing," he said. “We
acquired these apartments to rent

to tax the dorms.”

Hayllar also questioned the
status of the presidential mansion.

“This mansion is maintained to

he said. “It might be different if

said. “The burden will eventually

Popper also said that if the

of tuition increases again this

Pittsburgh teenager organizes
bone marrow donor search  

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

As the message on the telephone answering
machine of Simon Atlas states, “You have reached
friends of Allison.” Many people are hard at work
for 20-year-old Allison Atlas’ cause.

Approximately one year ago, Atlas had thought
that a combination of her job and her studies at

New York University was dragging her down, often ‘

leaving her overtired and lacking energy.

Not too long afterward, the resident of Bethesda,
Md. suddenly collapsed — it was not because she
was simply fatigued.

Within days, Atlas’ family and friends were
shocked to learn that she faced death, as she
battled a type of leukemia that rarely strikes people
under 60 years of age.

Currently, with the possibility of ﬁnding a much-
needed bone-marrow donor exhausted among
family and friends, a “friends of Allison” blood-
screening program has been rapidly organized.
The program’s sole purpose is to largely widen the
search through mass appeal.

Tammy Brown, a spokeswoman for the Life-
savers Foundation of America has said that
nationally, Atlas is one of approximately 11,000
people who are in dire need of bone-marrow
transplants, and who do not have family members
who are labeled as suitable donors.

The odds of two unrelated persons matching for
marrow-transplants are an unfavorable 15,000 to 1.
Because marrow transplant programs are relatively
new (established two years ago), and because not
enough people are‘ aware about such efforts as the
National Donor Marrow Program, there are not
enough potential donors registered statewide.

The National Marrow Donor Program is an
arganization charged by Congress with the

 

responsibility for providing “an ethical, ordered -I

and medically appropriate process for marrow
transplants involving unrelated donors.”

It establishes the medical standards, supervises
research and coordinates transplants at 32 transplant
centers and 62 donor centers.

The Atlas family has raised extensive funds to test
peopleacross the country. Unfortunately, a match
for Atlas has not yet been found; however, their
efforts have produced matches for 4 other people.

Another problem that Atlas must deal with is the
fact that her best chance of ﬁnding a donor outside
of her family involves someone with her “own
ethnic gene pool."

Atlas is of Jewish descent, and her family's search
has been undertaken by synagogues and Jewish
organizations.

“The best blood type for Allison wouldcome
from someone of Eastern Europeon background,
namely from the Jewish community,” said Barbara
Mendlowitz, spokesperson for the Ladies Hospital
Aid Society. .

Although Atlas’ blood type is very rare, the
efforts of Jewish communities on her behalf has
increased the National Bone Marrow Registry from
approximately 58,000 to 80,000.

Along with the efforts of national campaigns and
the Atlas family, one individual is doing more than
her share for Atlas’ cause.

Rachel Tiven, a 15-year-old Taylor Allderdice
High School sophomore, spearheads a Pittsburgh
screening program on behalf of Atlas. “ .

Atlas and Tiven had attended the same small

, Washington, D.C., Jewish day school from which

Atlas graduated.

Tiven does not know Atlas very well, but became
interested in her cause when Tiven’s parents were
tested to be possible donors.

Feb. 26 -- A Tower A resident
reported to campus police that
for the past month, an unknown
person has been calling her and
trying to get her to meet him. The
caller recently told her that if she
did not agree to go out with him,
he had her home phone number
and would call her over spring
break. He then read her the
number, which she told police
was correct. The student said that
she has no idea how he got her

home phone number and has no
clue who the caller is.

Feb. 26 — A Pitt police officer
responded to a call regarding a
suicide threat in Hillman Library.
Upon arriving at the ground floor,
the officer observed a man calmly
sitting in a chair holding a note
that said he wanted to kill himself.
The man was transported to WPIC
for observation.

Feb. 27 -— A student said that
she was walking across Bigelow

(

Boulevard from the Cathedral of
Learning to the William Pitt Union
when she was struck on the right
leg by a rust—colored Datsun
making a left turn. The student
said that the light was green, and
the walk sign was ﬂashing when
she crossed. The driver of the car
gave the student his insurance
card and other identiﬁcation. She
went to Presbyterian—University
Hospital for treatment but was
not seriously injured.

“I am an active member of the
Jewish community,” said Tiven.
“I wanted to get something going
in the Pittsburgh area [to help
Allisonl.”

“It is remarkable that a 15-year-
old girl is responsible for getting
everything in motion [here in
Pittsburghl,” said Mendlowitz.

To be a participant in the testing,
one must be between the ages of
18 and 55 and be exempt from a

list of certain medical conditions.

Once a compatible donor is
found, a small amount of marrow
is removed from the donor’s hip,
while the donor is under
anesthesia.

Doctors say that the donor’s
bone marrow regenerates quickly
with no impairment of health.
There is no cost to the donor.

...Yeozb, I'm the Taxman  

Quite a few years back, one of our wise Founding
Fathers noted that “the power to tax is the power to
destroy.” However, local politicians seem to have an
affinity for taxes and an insatiable desire to raise them and

levy new ones. And now, local universities, including Pitt, .

seem to be on their hit list.

As a non—profit institution of learning which serves
student needs and interests, Pitt properties fall into the
category of tax-exempt status.

' The city and county have challenged the tax-exempt
status of 30 local collegiate properties. Among the tar-
geted Pitt properties are Pitt Stadium, the section of the

‘Cathedral of Learning occupied by Roy Rogers Restau-

rant, the president’s residence, and apartment buildings
and houses on Atwood Street, Oakland Avenue and
North Dithridge Street.

We can understand why the president’s residence has
been targeted. After all, although it may be vital to his
interests, it may not be conducive to those of the
university.

But do Pitt Stadium, Roy Rogers and student-occupied
houses and apartment buildings serve student needs and
interests, and thus the University of Pittsburgh also?

A case can be made for tax exemption for Pitt Stadium

in that it attracts students to Pitt through the prestige of '

university athletics. The university also claims that nearly
70 percent of the stadium time is used for intramural
purposes, thereby serving student recreational interests,
not to mention the band practice and ROTC drills held at
the stadium. However, revenue generated through ticket
sales and athletic events at Pitt Stadium goes primarily to
the athletic department, not the university. As long as this
is so, the stadium should not be within current tax-
exempt guidelines.

Roy Rogers Restaurant provides ﬁnancial feedback to

' _ the university in the form of rental fees for its space at the
. bottom of the Cathedral of Learning. Additionally, its

participation in the university's food-service program,
Choice Dollars, caters to student needs and interests.
As for the targeted houses and apartment buildings,
these buildings provide student housing, of which there
is not enough on campus to accommodate student needs.
To say that these buildings don’t fall in the category of tax
exemption for the university is to claim that they are not
relevant to Pitt’s interests. But how can a major institution
S of learning attract students if they don’t have adequate or
enoughhousing? Then again, Pitt could easily eliminate

 this whole fias.co if it replaced the buildings with actual

dorms; although that’s quite a price to pay, literally, to
‘avoid taxation.

"If Pitt is forced to give up its tax-exempt status, it will
undoubtedly lose money, surely at the expense of
-parents’ and students’ checkbooks. This is also a very bad
time to target the university‘ with such a policy, consider-
ing that Pitt is projecting‘ a budget deficit possibly as high
as $12 million. From the battle over tax-exempt status for
Allegheny General Hospital to the amusement tax to local
universities, the city seems determined to tax everything
and anything.

It's time for local politicians to give up their infatuation
with taxes and begin to consider the fact that tax-exempt
status is vital to a competing and functioning university.

Getting away with the President

It isn’t often thatl side with the
Pitt administration these days.
Especially since that masterpiece
of policy-making, The Hiring
Freeze.

I probably wouldn’t have
agreed with Pitt on this tax-ex-
empt status thing either, except
for a conversation I had with Dr.
Wesley Posvar last week.

It all started Sunday night when
I read a Press article about all the

property Pitt owns and rents .

commercially. The _city was

crying, “You can’t do that!” and I

had to agree under the circum-
stances.

Among Pitt’s tenants are a bank,
a convenience store and a copy
shop, none of which can, in all
fairness, be -considered educa-
tion—related. .

So I decided the city had a
point for once. And on Monday I
began phoning Dr. Posvar’s of-
fice to find out why he hadn't
paid our taxes.‘

I spoke first with the assistant
to Dr. Posvar’s personal secre-
tary, who told me he was out of
town. He was lunching with Gov.
Robert Casey, she said.

“Who's picking up the tab?” I
asked. She transferred me di-
rectly to Dr. Posvar’s personal
secretary. ~

“Dr. Posvar is meeting with
Vice President Dan Quayle in
Washington,” she said.

“Regarding what?” I asked.

“The Third-Century Campaign,"
she said.

“Thanks. Thanks a lot.”

The Assistant to Dr. Posvar’s
Appointment Book is a personal
friend of mine, so I called her
next. I -knew she’d-be straight
with me.

‘ “He went to the island for a
little [R-n-"R," she told me in con-
fidence. “But don’t print that.”

‘‘I won't," I assured her and
began making travel arrange-
merits.

I can't explain how I came to
have Ed Bozik’s MasterCard
number, but it's unimportant since
it was rejected by University
Travel. I'm a little ashamed to say
I had to resort to a form of
embezzlement to come up with
the airfare.

If you go to the Ofﬁce of the
Comptroller and speak incoher-
ently, the woman behind the desk
will, almost invariably, assume
you are a TA and stamp your
travel-advance form. In triplicate.

It’s somewhat dishonest, I
know, but I had to do it.

Mindy
Boffemmyer

I didn’t hold it against Wes,
running away from his adminis-
trative duties to bask in the sun-
shine on the island (a piece of
Pitt's tax-exempt property, for
those of you unfamiliar with it).
Oakland is cold this time of year
— bitter cold, and the island is
really a great place. “A Pacific
Paradise," the billboards read.
There’s an Original Hot Dog Shop,
a shanty, a branch of Your Cam-
pus Store and even a miniature
Cathedral of Learning, reminis-
cent of the miniature Statue of
Liberty in Paris.

When the plane landed, I be-
gan searching for Wes. He wasn’t
hard to locate. I found him lying
on the sand wearing Bermuda
shorts and a fishing hat; he had a
rolled-up towel over his eyes to
block the sun. He was humming
something that, oddly enough,
sounded like “Over the Hills and
Far Away.” '

“Dr. Posvar?”

He started, removing the towel
from his eyes and squinting
against the sun to see my face.

“Mindy Boffemmyer——-The Pitt
News.” Iﬂashed my press pass.

He began to laugh hysterically. I -

glared at him a moment in frus-
tration, ‘then launched into a five-
minute tirade in defense of the
high-grade journalism produced

-by The Pitt News.

He interrupted, finally, to point
out that I'd ﬂashed my Paul Har-
vey FanClub card by mistake. He
then invited me to join him and
ordered a couple of pina coladas.
His wife swung by in a hula skirt,
laughed like a banshee, then
danced away toward the pig roast.

I whipped out my reporter's
notebook and asked, “Why? Why

are you using this charitable tax-
exempt status to conceal exploita-
tive, capitalistic ventures?”

He slurped his pina colada and
stared at the seascape reﬂectively.

“The truth is, we're nearly sunk.
The business of educating stu-
dents isn’t nearly as lucrative as it
used to be,” he said.

“You. expect the readers to buy
that after you've raised their tui-
tion again this year and thrown in
that computer fee?”

“It's true,” he said, shaking his
head slowly. “We're in real
trouble. Big trouble. I don’t know
what we’ll do now that we've
overextended the limit on Ed’s
card.” .

“Tell me about it.”

“But don’t print that," he said.

“I won't,” I promised, record-
ing the conversation diligently.

“It’s a tough job, running a
university,” he conﬁded.

“Yeah, yeah. You've got a roof
over your head, pal —- a free, tax-
exempt roof. I've been sleeping
on a couch for two months.” ‘

“Hey,” he said, “it isn’t the pal-
ace the press makes it out to be.
The roof leaks. Try holding a
dinner party with soggy hors
d’oeuvres: waterlogged cheese
puffs. Try asking one of your
distinguished guests to make a
contribution after she’s sprained
her ankle tripping over a bucket
of rainwater."

He bit his upper lip. His eyes
were misty.

“Sounds like a drag," I offered.

“She's suing, you know. That
woman is suing the university for
lost wages and pain and suffer-
ing!" . ‘ ' I
I grimaced.._ . - »

“Everyone’s suing us. Sexual
discrimination. Racial discrimina-
tion. One student is actually suing
me because her financial-aid
check is late. Can you believe
that?”

I looked away, my face turning
pink, and decided to drop the
suit

We were quiet then, sipping
our drinks and watching Mrs.
Posvar hula across the horizon.

“Say, Wes, what about that A

hiring freeze?” I asked ﬁnally.
“Drink up, kid. Drink up.”

Time for baseball team
to shine in Florida sun

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther baseball team
is coming off a 6-25 season and
has 15 new faces on its roster this
year. That doesn’t leave too much
room for optimism, but don’t tell
Pitt Coach Bobby Lewis that as
his team starts the season by
embarking this weekend upon its
23rd annual trip to Florida.

“We may not lose a game,” said
Lewis. “We’re undefeated right
now, and we're going to try to
stay that way.”

The Panthers are heading to
Florida to play six, possibly seven
games. They open up against St.
Joe on Sunday and continue on
successive days with Illinois,
Rollins, North Dakota, Central
Florida and Michigan.

According to Lewis, the team is
trying to add a game on
Wednesday of the trip. The team
has a night game scheduled that

day and would like to add a
morning game. “We are looking

to give everyone more
opportunities,” Lewis said.

“We have to make some
decisions, because once we get
to the Big East season, we will
only be able to travel with 25
players. By taking 32 [players],
we can give everyone that extra
opportunity to show what they
can do.

“We have to look at the trip as
[a sort of spring training]. We are
going down to play hard and try
to win, but that's not the
paramount thing on my mind.

We have to give players a chance
to show what they can do in a
game," Lewis added.

According to Lewis, he really
doesn’t see any pitcher throwing
more than 90 pitches in a game.

“We are looking for the pitchers
to go out every inning and really
bear down. I don’t want them
pacing themselves to go nine
[innings]. We just want them to
show what they have.”

Lewis added, “Whatl like to do
is use maybe three pitchers in
[each oil the first couple of games
so thatl could give them a second
opportunity later in the week.

“I plan on going with a three— '

man rotation during the season,”
Lewis said. “I’ll probably add a
fourth when we have games
during the week and the
weekend. As for right now, I
have not set anyone into roles as
starter or reliever. I don’t want
anyone preparing themselves
differently. This way everyone
will work to be a starter.”

The inﬁeld is ‘set for the
Panthers. The first baseman will
be Matt Bianco, at second will be
Chris Cioffi, and at third, Carl
Frenchik. All are returning from-
last year’s team.

The shortstop job is up in the
air. “Two freshman are battling it
out, Ralph McNelly and Erik
Fisher. Two nice ballplayers.”
Lewis said.

Junior Blane Vu cci is the starting
catcher with junior Denny Little
as his backup. “Vucci will start,
but Little and a couple of
freshmen will be given an

The Pitt baseball team goes on the road to Florida to kick off the season.

opportunity on the trip,” Lewis
said.

According to Lewis, the outﬁeld
is in good shape. “We have six
outﬁelders who can all play
defensively. I’d put any of the six
out there. We have to see who
can hit, and that will decide who
will start. We need hitters in the
outfield.”

The six outﬁelders are Kirk
Domanick, Don Kremer, Bill
Sherbondy, Greg Trimbur, Keith
Wilson and Pitt running back
Curvin Richards. Domanick,
T rimbur and Richards are in their
first year with the baseball team.

“Curvin is a hard worker. He
doesn’t say much -— he just does, ”
Lewis said. “He didn't have the

opportunity to play last year, so
he is a little behind.

“The trip will be the most’

important for the outﬁelders. They
haven't seen‘ a ﬂy ball this year.”
Concerning the major—league
baseball lockout, Lewis said
college baseball will be the only
thing going in Florida. “We’ll
probably pack them in.”

An)/I906!)/is game in Big East tourney

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

Parity has taken over in Big
East women’s basketball. The
conference tournament will be
played this weekend at
Connecticut, and players and
coaches agree that any one of the
nine teams has a realistic chance
to win the championship.

“In this league, anyone can
win,” said Villanova Coach Harry
Parretta, whose team ﬁnished in
last place in the league. “I don’t

' think anyone has an easy game

[in the tournament}. We are
capable of beating anyone.”

“Once tournament time comes
around, you don’t know what
can ‘happen. Somebody can get
hot for a couple of days,” said
Connecticut head coach Geno
Auriemma. Connecticut finished
their season tied for ﬁrst in the
conference with Providence and
will be seeded first as a result of
a coin ﬂip.

“Anybody can win it," said Pitt
head coach Kirk Bruce.

“Connecticut is going to be tough
because they are at home. But
this is one time thatl can honestly
say that the winner of the eight
(seed) vs. nine (seed) game could
possibly be in the championship
game.”

Most of the league’s teams are
in the middle of either winning or
losing streaks. Providence, ranked
23rd in the nation by USA Today,
has won 11 in a row, including a
win last week over Connecticut.
Aside from theloss to Providence,

games .in a row. Georgetown,

" _who finished seventh in the

conference, has won three .of
their last four conference games.
Seton Hall has won four of their
last ﬁve.

On the losing side, Syracuse,
who finished in fifth place, and
Villanova have a fou r- game losing
streak.

Pitt finished sixth in the
conference with a record of 6-10.
They ﬁnished with an overall
winning season for the first time
in ﬁve years (14-13). The Lady

Panthers will play Seton Hall (21-
6, 11—5) Saturday at 1 p.m. in the
first round.

Four of Seton Hall's losses have
come to Providence and
Connecticut (twice each). But
most of the league feels Pitt could
be a spoiler. ,

“These guys have a lot of talent,”
said Auriemma. “I think they are

I scary. People are afraid of Pitt."

“Everyone views them as a
threat because they are capable

H b of scoring a lot of points,” added
. the Lady Huskies have -won.* 10 ~

Parretta. _

This year’s Lady Panther team
was the quintessential mediocre
team. They averaged 75 points a
game, butaiso gave up an average
of 75 points a game. Pitt will
work on a 82-80 overtime loss to
Connecticut last Saturday as a
positive example of what they
can do. But a loss to Villanova,

the Lady Wildcats’ only Big East»

win of the season, is a negative
example of what they can do.
“It's open for anybody,” said
Pitt co-captain Lorrijohnson. “We

Lacrosse club starts season oﬂ on the rigbtfoot against The Roc/e

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt lacrosse club opened its 1990
campaign with a 6-3 win over Slippery
Rock University on Tuesday night at Pitt
Stadium.

’ Pitt Coach’ Gary Neft was not
overwhelmed with the effort of his troops
against the Rockets, which he said is an

“average” team in the league. But he

excused his team’s rusty showing in its
first game of the season.

“We played very sloppy, ” said Neft. “We
could have played a lot better. We have to
try and improve.”

Pitt’s play was not the only sloppiness

hit our peak against Connecticut
and just found what we were
looking for.”

“We have split with a lot of
teams,” said senior Rita Anders on.
“I think our chances are great.
We played Seton Hall real tough
here. So I think our chances are
just as good as anybody’s. I think
the Connecticut game gave, us
the little extra that we needed.”

“We showed Saturday that we
are capable of winning the league
and going on to the NCAAs,” said
Pitt co-captain Jennifer Shingler.

Anderson said that Seton Hall
(11-5) is a physical team, but
feels Pitt can effectively counter
it with their running style.

associated with the game. Half of the
stadium turf was covered with snow,
making it difficult for players to move

" effectively. '

Pitt opened the scoring early in the first
quarter on a goal by Brian Oles, assisted
by defenseman Tony Leotta. Slippery Rock
was able to even the score before the end
of the quarter.

In the second period, Pitt exploded for
three goals. T om Keating broke the tie
early in the quarter; Dave Kounas scored
from 15 yards away, and Harper Watters
added a goal before the end of the first
half.

-Pitt mounted several attacks early in the
third quarter but was unable to convert.

Slippery (Rock was able to take advantage
of a Pitt penalty, scoring a man-up (power
play) goal to get back in the game.

Soon afterward, Pitt gave the ball away
in front of its own net, allowing for an easy
goal. Suddenly, it was a new game at 4-3.

“We slacked off,” said Kounas about
Pitt’s play in the third period. “People
weren't concentrating.”

Aside from their third- quarter letdown,
the Panthers dominated for most of the
game. They were able to put the pressure
back on. Defenseman Mike Neumann
picked up a loose ball in his own zone and
ran the length of the field for an unassisted
goal before the end of the quarter.

Keating scored his second goal of the

game early in the fourth to close out the
scoring.
Keating was Pitt’s star of the game with

~ his two goals. He also added an assist on

Kounas’ goal.

“Tom [Keating] is going to be an asset for
us this season," Neft said.

The Rockets were able to attack the Pitt
goal in the fourth quarter, but Pitt
goalkeeper Dave Franklin turned them

-aside each time.

Pitt will resume the season after spring
break with a game scheduled for March.13
at Pitt Stadium.

BEM: coming to grips with te

By Dmitri Ragano
Asst. Showcase Editor

The countless superheroes,
monsters and cartoon characters
lining the shelves of the B.E.M.
cornic—book store make up a
great deal of Bill Boichel’s life.
For Boichel, a collector for 25
years, running Pittsburgh’s
comprehensive comic-book
store is a labor of love. :

“I’m not making a killing, but
tl1at’s fine as far as I'm concerned, "
the lanky, dreadlocked Boichel
said.

Located in Wilkinsburg, B.E.M.
(which stands for “Bug—Eyed
Monster” — the first story to
appear in the Gilbert and Jaime
Hernandez’ Love and Rockets
comic book) attracts comic-book
devotees from around the tri-

state area.

B.E.M. '3 four-year existence has
seen comics reach an all-time
high as an art form and an industry.

“The whole market changed in
the early 1980s,” said Boichel.
Successful, new, independent
companies forced comic titans
Marvel and D.C. to change their
assembly—line creative processes.
More artistic freedom resulted in
fresh, fascinating comics. And
sales went up.

Epitornizing the '80s boom is
Frank Miller's inventive, haunting
The Darle Knight Returns. While
past superhero comics offered
lightweight escapism, DanlaKnz'gbt
was a scathing nightmare image
of urban America — full of violent
crime, demagogic media and
brooding angst. It was the Darla
Knight series that inspired the

Batman movie.

Less commercial, though no
less interesting, Boichel’s favorites
include Love and Rockets, which
follows the surreal lives of punks
in the L.A. barrio; Flaming Carrot,
a Dada superhero epic; and
Ronin, Mi1ler’s beautifully drawn
tale of futuristic samurais.

“All of the sudden, there were
these new comics coming out
that were blowing my mind,”
Boichel said. After leaving
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Boichel
published two magazines, N0
Comics and Transformer, which
went through 20 issues. “I finally
decided ‘what the hell, I'll open a
comic-book store.”’

Without much difficulty, B.E.M.
opened in February of 1986, the
same month as Darla Knights

disbanded for over three years,
while a self—titled album, The Five,
released in 1989 carries on their
musical legacy.

The Five originated in
Pittsburgh in September of 1980
from the friendship and vested
musical interests among Reid
Paley. (vocals), Tom Moran
(guitar), Dave Doremus (bass)
and Brian Gillespie (drums). “We
were four different people that
somehow, as the motley crew
that we were, fit together in order
to play,” says Paley from his
home in Boston.

If The Five is an outlandish
name for a four-man band, there’s
some heavy—~handed rock ‘n’ roll
reasoning behind it. “At our first
practice I said, ‘OK, look, we
have our first gig in 24 days.’ We
needed a name," says Paley. “We
were listed on the poster as
‘Special Guest.’ And the day
before the gig, we still, like the
idiots we were, couldn’t arrive at
a name, so we ended up with a
fuckin’ wanky name like ‘The
Five.’ Well, you can’t go changin’
your name, ‘cause nobody will
know who you are.”

The Five spent four years
establishing themselves on
Pittsburgh’s club circuit, and local
fans were sorely dissappointed
when the band made the long
haul to Boston in July of 1984,
where they continued to captivate

audiences with their live
performances. Bean Town
quickly accepted The Five as
their own among certain rock
circles, a phenomenon for new
bands in that area.

‘‘If you ’re in Boston and you’re
not from there, then God help
you,” says Paley. “Even if you’ve
never seen anybody in the
audience before, and you’re
getting encores the first time out,
 [according to locals] if you’re
not from Boston, then there’s
gotta be something wrong with
you.

“We were rockin’ like animals
in Pittsburgh when people from
Boston who decided they wanted
to rock were wearing turtlenecks
and sounding like R.E.M. So
consequently, being called an art
band is an epithet around here.

So you’ve got a bunch of people
on trust funds who are just
discovering that you can turn
your guitar up past six.”

From the outset, The Five made
a conscious effort to be as original
as possible without straying too
far from the true roots of rock.
The band shunned categorization
as most underground groups do.

Paley attributes the prompt
reception to the contrast The Five
brought to Boston’s musical scene
at the time. “We blew into [Boston]
which is a very conservative—pop
town,- and people would say,
‘Oh, you guys are that art band.’
Art band, yeah right. Guitar, bass,
drums and a guy who screams —
what a weird lineup. Pretty artsy,
huh?

“We were definitely a ‘rock’
kind of thing, really loud,” says
Paley. “Our roots run
exceptionally deep for a rock
band or for a band that’s generally
lumped with post—punk because
they didn’t know where to put

} us. There was sort of a blues
lllinﬂuence]. Not an obvious one,

 

but with more of a weird spin on
it. We had songs that gave ,the
feeling of blues without ever
resorting to obvious blues
progressions.”

As happens with many new
groups and their first record, the
album’s production was
prolonged due to typical snafus
of the music industry, ﬁnally being
released on the local BEM label
in the fall of 1989.

“Originally a guy named Chuck
Warner, who had a label around
here called Throbbing Lobster,
was claiming that he was going
to put the record out for about a
year and a half, almost two years,”
says Paley. “But he was just doing
jack shit and not doing anything
except flapping his lips, so he
effectively kept it off the market
for a couple of years.

“We eventually got totally
disgusted with it, and I realized
that time was running short. Bill
lBoichell had offered to put it
out, so that’s what we did.”

Continued from page 4

— band's independent nature

caused problems with securing a
recording deal. Producers often
don't take kindly to any input
from the band. They want total
control over production. “It was
never a matter of not having
enough songs to record; it's just
that maybe we seem too self-
sufficient to too many people.
And of course, not having
anybody to manage us 
“People, especially around
here, don’t like a band that’s
managed internally, because they
like you to be sort of a dumb
blonde. And I really have a hard
time pretending to be a dumb
blonde. It really sort of runs

« against my grain to pretend to be

stupid, since I ﬁgure I’m dumb
enough as it is.”

Seven years of limited success
proved to strain the ties among
the members, eventually causing
the demise of The Five. “There
were a lot of problems. It was a
sort of a mystery around [Boston]
why the band didn’t have a record
out, because we were certainly
doing everything right. There

were interpersonal problems;
people in the band started getting
weird,” Paley says.
The other members of The Five
couldn't be reached for comment.
Despite any hard feelings, The
Five have a record breaking onto
the college and alternative charts
and more than enough personal
memories. “Memorable [laughs],
we’re talking seven years with a
band here, ” says Paley. “One time
we had a hell trip. Everything
went wrong. We were [living] in
Boston, and we were playing
CBGB’s. The equipment was
stored over at Brian’s loft, and it
was four huge flights up, and the
freight elevator had been broken.
“Then a friend was bringing
stuff from Pittsburgh to Boston
and then was going to drive us to
New York, and he broke down
about an hour outside the city. So
we had to get a car and then go
out and help fix the van out in
some God—awful place.
“Somehow we got there just in
time for our set. We were all
bombed by the time we arrived
because we were so stressed out.

“CD3, the good ones, don’

Turntables have become more

office. The store won’t open for
another hour, and a portion of
the estimated 250,000 albums that
proprietor Jerry Weber owns
takes center stage in the store
that used to be known as Garbage
Records.

“If I was anywhere but Oakland
I wouldn’t sell [cassettes] in the
store” saysjerry, peering out over
his vast album collection from his
checkout counter one story above
Forbes Avenue. By his own
estimation, LP sales account for
50 percent of his business, while
compact discs, one of the latest
waves of technology from the
music industry, turns out 20
percent and cassette tapes the
remaining 30 percent. With the
relatively low‘ price and
convenience of portable cassette
and CD players, Jerry, 40, says he
would be missing a vital part of
the market if he did not offer
alternatives to albums. And given
the fact that he stocks mostly
popular titles in both categories,

goes the way of the eight-track
tape and into the $4.99 sale bin at
those retail stores that have not
already eliminated LPs from their
stock.

Major radio stations have also
made the transition from LP to
CD. Pitt’s WPTS, like many small
stations, can’t justify the expense
or even find the titles that fit their
playlist, however.

“A lot of [the releases] are still
on vinyl because CD5 are so
expensive and the independent
labels can’t put them out.” says
Joan Kane, WPT S’ promotions
director. Kane said WPT S does
have over 200 discs though.

Like most used-record stores,
Jerry's has benefitted somewhat
from the LPs availability problem.
“It’s been busier, but the CD5 do
real well too," Jerry says.

Yet the man who has taken out
insurance on his personal
collection of 20,000 LPs does not
think that new releases will be
available on CD and cassette only.

“I really think after a period of

of music collectors who sell
their LPs in order to replace
them with the l1igher— quality
sound of discs.

“So many people are
dumping their albums. I always
thought albums had warmth
and feeling to them. I also
understand I’m from a different
generation, and the people
marketing this stuff forgot that.
There’_,_s people between the
ages of 35 and 55 with great,
big album collections,” who
are always trying to add to
them, Jerry says.

For those who feel that a
scratch or a blemish on an
album is asmuch a part of the
music as what lies between
the grooves, the decline of the
LP is disheartening. “I kind of
like the crackling in vinyl. I'm
not in for the precision,” says
Kane, also an Oasis Records
employee. “People come‘ in
and buy the Sex Pistols disc

for better quality. Why? People I

want to hear Sid Vicious burp

   

before opening his own store, and
whose standard work clothing -
sweats —- seems as comfortable as
slipping a worn and scratched copy
of Rubber Soul onto the turntable.

“[It’s probably some kind] of anti-
trust violation,” he says. There’s no
telling when the bottom of the LP
market might fall out altogether,
leaving collectors with large,
outdated collections and erstwhile
pieces of equipment. “If you buy a
car, tl1ey’ve got to make ’ parts
available for 10 years or something,”
he says. Thus, albums should be
available for those who prefer
turntables, and vice versa.

He also ﬁnds that many people,
mostly personal friends, who have
traded in album collections for CD3
decide afterwards that it might not
have been the right move. Many
titles are not yet available on disc,
and some albums maintain a rare
status that will not be replaced by
reissues on CDs.

out to buy CDs. They'll end up

Retail stores, however, are
capitalizing on the newfound
success of the CD, as sales show.
That’s whyjerry is able to operate
without feeling any bitterness
from the the two music stores,
Oasis and Record Outlet, within
just yards of his own business.

“I used to get some ﬂak from
them, but after a while, they
noticed their sales didn’t drop
one iota,” he says. Then there’s
the fact that some people will not
buy used records when newly
released CDs and cassettes are
available. “If it's used, I don’t
want it," is the attitude of some

situation, though. Some
customers are offended that they
can’t find titles in retail stores and
visitJerry’s and other used-record
stores often. “What’s encouraging
is the people who keep coming
in.”

And the price is right too. While
new discs retail for $3 to $4 more
than albums, Jerry offers
recordings for as little as 94 cents
for a used album.

Jerry does his best to
accommodate those who do
frequent his store, even offering
a buy-back deal where customers
can purchase an album and retum
it within three days and have
approximately two-thirds of their
purchase price returned if they

crowd, it may already be the way
of the past, as the the LP has
become at Oasis. “Some very
disgruntled customers come in
and say, ‘Where’s your
vinyl?’,”says Kane. “In the box by
the steps,” she answers. “Pretty
much all lOasis’] vinyl has been
discontinued. I can’t even recall
the last new title we got on vinyl.”

Jerry’s not sure, however, when
his luck, or that of the LP, will run
out, if ever.

“If they quit printing albums,
I'll sell what I have left and that’s
it.”

That would be it for 250,000
albums, over 150,000 455,
approximately 5,000 to 6,000
cassettes and a small quantity of
the dreaded CDs. But Jerry isn't
vindictive or even particularly
worried. After all, his business
springs from his love for music,
and after beginning his operation
