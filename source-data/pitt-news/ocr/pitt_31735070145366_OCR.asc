Debate
now in

doubt

Gubernatorial
candidates might not
face off on campus

Amy Friedenberger
Staff Writer

Pennsylvania’s two candidates for.

governor are still debating wheth-
er to hold a debate on campus this
fall.

Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly president Nila
Devanath is working to bring the
race’s two candidates to campus in
late September. So far, Allegheny
County Executive and Democratic
candidate Dan Onorato has, agreed
to participate in the debate. His op-
ponent, state Attorney General and
Republican candidate Tom Corbett,
has not conﬁrmed whether he will
attend.

The debate is tentaﬁvely set for
Sept. 21.

Devanath said she received a
conﬁrmation from the Onorato

’ campaign injune.

She had said this summer that
Pitt’s potential debate could be the
ﬁrst in the race, but Onorato’s com-
munications director Brian Herman
could not conﬁrm when and where
the ﬁrst debate will take place.

~ “Dan is deﬁnitely interested in
reaching out to as many people as
possible, and the students are a
concern of his because they are the
future of this current economy,” Her-
man said. -

Herman said the debate schedule
has notbeen ﬁnalized and could not
guarantee that a debate would hap-
pen on campus this year as Corbett
has not conﬁrmed that he will make
an appearance at Pitt.

So far, the Republican has agreed

to one debate, set for Sept. 27 in Her-
shey, Pa. The Pennsylvania Chamber
of Business and Industry will host
the debate, and Ted Koppel, aformer
host of ABC’s “Nightline,” is set 'to
moderate.

Kevin Harley, communications
director for the Corbett campaign,
did not respond to ﬁve phone calls
over the past two weeks.

If Corbett is unable to attend the
debate, Devanath said that the event
will be downsized to a more casual
gathering where Onorato will speak,
followed by a question—and-answer
session.

’ Devanath made one last push for
the debate between the candidates

by calling the Corbett campaign this ‘

week. V
“At this point, all I can really do
is hope for the best,” Devanath said.

“I would really love to have a debate -

here at Pitt.”

Onorato challenged Corbett to
14 debates earlier this summer after
participating in a heated primary.

_ That number is typically considered

highfor a statewide race — the 2006
contest between Republican candi-
date Lynn Swann and incumbent
Democrat Ed Rendell featured three
debates. ' _

Other groups are also working
to make the debate possible at Pitt.
Among them is the Pittsburgh Ur-
ban Magnet Project, a civic engage-
ment campaign aimed at motivating
young people to participate in the
civic process. -

Another organization assistingin
the push for the debate is the League
of Women Voters of Greater‘ Pitts-
burgh, which hosted Onorato at a
debate during the Democratic pri-
mary earlier this year. I

Devanath said the idea for the
gubernatorial debate came out of a
meeting she had with Paul Supowitz,
Pitt’s vice chancellorfor governmen-
tal relations. The two discussed civic
engagement, and both want to get
undergraduates more involved in
local and state politics.

Few students have been openly
involved in politics on campus. The
May 18 primary election had a less-
than—5 -percent tumout in the wards
that cover Pitt’s campus.

“I’ve just been focusing on what
Ed Rendell is doing, but I will deﬁ-
nitely catch up by November,” fresh-
man Ryan Clune said of his political

interest. “For me, it’s going to come

down to education and tax policy.”
Freshman Henry Lucas had al-

ready made up his mind. . .
“I don’t know who his opponent

.is, but I plan to "vote for Onorat;o,’7

he said.

Other students were less deci-
sive. '

“I don’t know about the gover-
nors race. I’m from Philadelphia,”
said one student who declined to
give his name.

Corbett is leading Onorato in
the race according to a recent poll
released by Franklin 8: Marshall
College.  1

According to the poll, Corbett

leads Onorato by only one point —-
29 percent to 28 percent—when all
registered voters are considered.

Corbett’s lead jumps 11 percent
— 38 percent to 27 percent —+ when
only likely voters are factored in.

The gubernatorial election will
be on Nov. 2, when voters will also
choose a lieutenant governor, a new
U.S. representative and a new U.S.
senator. I

expectations —— pertaining to lifestyle
and environmental attitudes — are

Pitt, however, needn’t don any

Without question, Oakland throws

But that’s not to say the balance A _

The issue here is Panther Hollow.
Located behind South Oakland, this

I Jacob Brown
Columnist

I’ve tried to dislike Charlie Shull’s SGB
administration. I really have.

As someone who has attended ev-
ery SGB meeting sincejoe Pasqualichio
rantl1eshowi_n2006, I’ve seenSGBs so
badtheywould make the U.S. Congress
blush.]ustwhen I’dthinkthey couldn’t

go out of their way to surprise me. ’

$180 activity fee goes.

Bythistime any otheryear, the only
good I’d be able to discern in SGB’s ac-
tivities would probably come in the
form of one of former board member
Nila Devanath’s pet projects. In a'No-
vember2009 column ofmine,Isaid of
the current Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly president, “Ifmore
SGB members shared her ardor, per-
haps SGB’s integrity wouldn’t even be
in question.” .

even more transparent. Yes, that means
making meetings open to the public
even ifthey don’t include time foraudi-
ence participation.

2) Get Chancellor Nordenberg to
attend meetings, if only to show sup-
port.

3) Guarantee that subcommittees
never have nonresponses during meet-
ings. Whether FreshmanAﬂ'airs orthe
proposed Student Civic Engagement
Committee, these groups should always
have projects to work on.

4) Ramp up student involvement.
Tell Student Life to relax its rules with
tabling and meet-and-greets with SGB.
Like I said, make students care.

5) Lastly, dissolve the current SGB
structure. Having nine largely homo-
geneous board members does not
make for the best representation of
life around campus. I’m not usually a
fanofbureaucracy, but17,000 students
deserve representation, and they hail
from a wide variety of residence halls,
areas of campus and schools within the
University.

Speakingwith Devanath lastyear,I
was told that conversations had taken
place concerning refomiatting SGB
into a senate to cover a greater level
of diversity among students. Carnegie
Mellon usesthis system, and Duquesne
has an executive board modeled much
like0urcurrentBoard, alongwith sena-
tors from each college.

I know most of these requests are
long shots, but, then again, I used to
think having SGB do its job properly
wasaskingtoo much. _

The current SGB members have
four months notonly to make further
strides in campus politics, but also to
revolutionize the way students think
of their representatives. It is my hope
theystep upto thatchallenge. I

THEATER

September 2, 2010'! The Pitt News ’l WWW.pittnews.e'orn

Shakespeare in the Parks plays in Frick Park

The local group will perform the playwright’s ‘Much Ado About Nothing’ for free early this Saturday afternoon.

Jocelyn Meehan
Staff Writer

For those of you who ﬁnd sit-
ting in English class and reading
Shakespeare a bit dry, Pittsburgh
Shakespeare in the Parks offers a
possible remedy.

This Saturday, the group will
present its energetic rendition of
“Much Ado About Nothing” in the
sunny setting of Frick Park. The
interactive performance begins
at 2 p.m. near the Blue Slide Play-
ground on Beechwood Boulevard
and Nicholson Street in Squirrel
Hill.

“The show starts by the side-
walk near the playground and
moves down into abeautiful bowl
of trees,” director Melissa Hill
Grande said.

Grande said moving this per-
formance of “Much Ado About
Nothing” out of a theater and into
a park setting allows the dynamic
actors to interact with the audi-
ence and physically them physi-
cally from scene to scene.

“We use what’s there  and
work with the landscape,” Grande
said.

This hands—on approach is in
every aspect of the performance.
Actors will interact with the au-
dience by directly speaking with
viewers, thus breaking down the
proverbial fourth wall common to
many traditional portrayals.

“The audience is really invited

to interact during these perfor-
mances,” saidjennifer Tober, the
artistic director and founder of
Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the
Parks.

Tober founded the Pittsburgh
company after spending time
working with a similar program in
New York. The former Big Apple
resident took part in other Shake-
speare park performances in the
Bronx and Queens before she re-
located to the Pittsburgh area and
started the organization here.

“Much Ado About Nothing”
will be Pittsburgh Shakespeare
in the Parks’ sixth show since
the company’s start in 2005.
In the past, the groups has put
on “As You Like It,” “A Midsum-
mer Night’s Dream,” “Macbeth,”
“Twelfth Night” and “Love’s La-
bour’s Lost.”

Tober explained that many
Pitt theater students and gradu-
ates are actively involved with the
company. Some of these current
and former Panthers include:
Tonya Lynn, Charlie Brown and
Cara Kierzkowski. Even the as-
sistant director for “Much Ado
About Nothing,” Tommy Costello,
is a Pitt graduate student.

As if Panther pride, a scenic
backdrop and free admission
weren’t enough, audience mem-
bers canreserve lunches to munch
on beforehand. For $10, Whole
Foods Market provides a picnic
lunch that includes meat and veg-
etarian sandwich options, grilled

People who want to reserve a

1 p.m. __
To make the most of the event,
Grande encourages attendees to

bring along a blanket, snacks and
some loved ones with whom to
relax and enjoy the free event.

“It makes for a really nice af-
ternoon,” Grande said. “You get
to see theater, sit outside and not
do homework.”

In addition to Saturday’s per-
formance, “Much Ado About

Nothing” will also be play Sept.
11 and 12 at Allegheny Commons
Park at W. North Avenue and
Brighton Road in the North Side;
Sept. 18. and 19 at Mellon Park on

ALBUM REVIEW

Bethie Girmai
Stajf Writer

Frontier Ruckus
Deadrnalls & Nightfalls
Label: Ramseur Records
Grade: B

Frontier Ruckus, one of the break-
out stars at this year’s Bonnaroo
music and arts festival, impressed
folk-rock music fans with the re-

lease of its second full-length album,
Deadmalls and Nightfalls, late this
summer.

The band is comprised of Mat-
thew Milia on vocals, guitar, har-
monica and pedal steel guitar; Da-
vid W. Jones on banjo, Dobro and
vocals; Ryan “Smalls” Etzcorn on
drums and percussion and Zach-
ary Nichols, playing singing saw,
trumpet, alto horn, euphonium and
melodica.

 

The Detroit—based band burst

onto the folk-rock music scene with ’

its 2007 debut, The Orion Songbook.
Its sophomore album evokes com-
parisons to artists likejackie Greene
and Bob Dylan. On certain tracks
on the album, Milia’s vocals even
channel those of Counting Crows
frontman Adam Duritz. -

While Deadmalls and Nightfalls
is a contemporary spin on folk-rock
music, it’s lacking in areas that a

Frontier Ruckus releases. sophomore album I

listener’ won’t be able to ignore.
Although the instrumentals are in‘-

ventive and the lyrics have depth,

Milia’s throaty voice fails to measure

p up. Furthermore, though the band
remains consistent throughout the 1

album, some of the songs’ similari-
ties cause them to blend together.
It might be a hit or miss withfans
of Top 40 music,,,but Deadmalls 8
Nightfalls is sure to strike a chord
with folk-rock fans.

Wannstedt at home with Panthers

its

Angela Anderson I Staff Photographer
Pitt head coach Dave Wannstedt is entering the most anticipated
season of his career coaching the Panthers.

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

Head football coach Dave Wannst-
edt still has some empty ﬁngers
on his hand.

As a graduate assistant coach
for the Panthers during the 1976
season and the defensive coordi-
nator of the Miami Hurricanes
in 1987, Wannstedt earned two
collegiate championships in ad-
dition to a SuperV_Bowl ring he
earned as the assistant lihéfad
coachof the.Dallas Cowboys in
1992. ' I g P
' With three rings, he still has
room for a couple more.

Wannstedt’s spent years try-
ing to bring those extra titles
back to the ‘Burgh. He became
Pitt’s head football coach after
the conclusion of the 2004 sea-
son. He came close to a Big East
Championship last year, and his

. teams have become national and

conference contenders.

Perhaps he tries so hard be-
cause he has decades—long ties
to the city. '

“His roots are here,” said Bob.

Palko, who coaches at West Al-
legheny High School about 20
minutes west of the city. Palko

' has sent several players to Pitt,

including one of Wannstedt’s first
big recruits, Dorin Dickerson.
He also sent his son, Tyler, who

played quarterback for Pitt from’

2002 to 2006.

Wannstedt attended Baldwin
High School and, upon gradua-
tion, came to Pitt as an offensive
tackle where he was eventually
named captain of the 1973 Pan-
thers.

He remained at the University
as a graduate student coach while

‘he earned a master’s degree in

education in 1976 and stayed on
as a receivers and special teams’

' coach until 1978.

He bounced around for the
next 26 years, as he took posi-
tions with three different colle-
giate programs and three NFL
teams, most recently as the
2004 head coach of the Miami
Dolphins. . ~ '

Wannstedt returned home to
Pittsburgh in December 2004,
when he was named -head coach
of the Panthers, following the
departure of Walt Harris.

“This opportunity is some-
thing I have dreamed about since
my early days at Pitt,” Wannst-
edt said after he was hired. “I
wouldn’t want to do this job
anywhere else.”

Since that time, he has worked

tirelessly to build a football pro-
gram at Pitt that could compete
for a national championship, as
his 1976 team successfully did.

With two consecutive nine—win
seasons and a Bowl victory last
year, Wannstedt has succeeded
in putting his Panthers back on
the collegiate football map.

Part of the reason for Wannst-
edt’s turn—around is his ability to
heavily recruit talent to Pitt using
his own experiences and enthu-
siasm for the University and its
football team. , A

“It’s really easy to sell the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh,” Wannstedt
said. “I lived most of the great
stories here and I am able to talk

V about those times from ﬁrst—hand

experience.” .

Wannstedt’s ﬁrst recruiting
class, the freshmen arriving for
the 2005-06 season, included
quarterback Bill Stull, lineback-
er Mick Williams and defensive
lineman Gus Mustakas, all key
players in last season’s successes
as redshirt seniors. Two of those
players signed with NFL teams
this year: Stull with the Chiefs in
August and Williams with the Jets
shortly after the draft in April.

Perhaps the greatest addition
to the Panthers under Wannstedt
has been running back phenom

Brotherly bonds enhance Pitt football experience

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

When talking about each other,
football players often say, “He’s

like a brother to me.” Eight Pan- '

thers have both “brothers” and
actual siblings ‘on the team.
Four sets of brothers play
football for Pitt, and many said
that having family on the team
helps push them harder and gives

them a slight advantage. The Pitt.

News took a look at many of these
pairs.

Andrew and Jon Taglianetti

The name Taglianetti already
has a place in Pittsburgh sports
history. When Andrew and jon
were just toddlers, their father,
Peter, won two Stanley Cups as
a defenseman for the Pittsburgh
Penguins.

But now the redshirt sopho-
more twins are ready to make
a space for their own names in
Pittsburgh sports lore. If there is
one thing that will help them ac-
complish that, ’it’s one another.

“It just seems normal, you
know,” Andrew said of playing
with his brother. “We’re always
with each other. We live together,
too. We didn’t play with each other

in high school, but now I always
have someone on my side here.”

The brothers from Bridgeville.
went to different high schools.
Jon stayed at South Fayette High
School while Andrew went to Cen-
tral Catholic in Oakland.

“I just wanted to do something
else,” Andrew said. “The all-boy
Catholic education, I thought,
would be very beneﬁcial. It just

worked out well, and they had a

good football. team.”

Andrew, along with Pitt’s start-
ing quarterback Tino Sunseri, won
a PIAA state championship at Cen-
tral Catholic his senior year, while
Jon quarterbacked South Fayette

and rushed for 898 yards his se-
nior season.

So when the twins started
training camp together in 2008,
it was the ﬁrst time in four years
that they had‘ played organized
football together.

“I think it brings us closer to-
gether,” Jon said. “We see each
other every day. I like being
around him and having some-
one there that understands and
someone I can talk to whenever
Ineed to.” — ' ‘

“Having a family member here
is a big help with what you go
through every day,” he said.”

But the on—ﬁeld reunion almost

didn’t happen.

.“I wasn’t really sure about play-
ing college football,” Jon said. “I
have [an equipment management]
job with the Penguins that I take
pretty seriously, and it’s some-
thing that I want to get into. I
was leaning toward working more
and going to school, but not really
playing football.”

“But being close to home and
playing sports isn’t something
I couldn’t really turn down,” he
said. I

Andrew was still deciding
which school he wanted to attend,
but whenjon committed to Pitt, he
easily made up his mind.

H noski a key to big
o ensive plays

Fullback clears way for Dion Lewis and Ray Graham

Sean Coyne I For The Pitt News

Not only will Hynoski block to help make big plays, but he should touch the football

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

Behind the highlight reel runs of Dion
Lewis and Ray Graham is a player who
doesn’t get nearly the same amount of
national recognition. ‘

He’s the player whodoes a lot of the
dirty work, creating gaps that Lewis and
Graham can slip through, but ask any
coach or player on the Pitt football team
and they’ll tell you fullback Henry Hynoski
is just as important in making the offense
go. -
“He enjoys contact. He enjoys trying
to be physical,” running back coach David
Walker said. “He’s a big part of anything
that we do run—game wise. To have a guy

‘that you can run—behind"and‘ he canlead

the play and he can effectively handle his
guys, it’s a very nice feature to have, trust
me.” V

_ Hynoski put up some gaudy statistics
at Southern Columbia Area High School

more this season.

c

in Elysburg, Pa., finishing as the seventh-
leading rusher in Pennsylvania history
with 7,165 yards. As a senior, he rushed
for 2,407 yards and 42 touchdowns on 206
carries. That’s 11.7 yards per attempt,

At Pitt, though, Hynoski said his main
priority is to be a blocker for Lewis and
Graham.

“I’m going in there with everything I’ve
got and trying to put someone on their
back with every play,” Hynoski said. “Dion
and Ray are so talented, they are just go:
ing to cut right off me and make big runs.
That’s just how it goes.” i

Hynoski said that although his role this
season will remain similar to last year,
he sees himself getting the ball more this

_ year. In_2oo9, he rushed for 1.07. yardson
’24 attempts —— an average of 4.5 yards

per carry.

“I can see myself, just by the way sum-
mer camp is going and what the coaches
have told me, getting more carries out of
the backfield and single-back sets with

Diana Connor I For The Pitt News

Ricky Gary goes for a tackle in last year’s game against Notre Dame. He will line up as a

Kelly Flanigan
' Staﬁ"Writer

All eyes were on the quarterback position this ’
summer as fans waited to see whether Tino_
Sunseri could adequately step in for Bill Stull.
What Pitt fans might have overlooked in all
that hubbub was the search for new corner~
backs, critical players on the defense. ~

The Panthers felt a huge loss when all-star
cornerback Aaron Berry graduated last year
and was picked up in the NFL as a free agent
by the Detroit Lions. He was a staple of the
secondary in his years at Pitt with ﬁve career
interceptions and was named to the 2009 All-
Big East Team. Despite missing two games
due to injury that season, he still accumulated
28 tackles and nine pass break—ups.

Who couldvreplace this kind of produc-
tivity in the secondary? That answer came
quickly to the team throughout summer
workouts and was only conﬁrmed in the
team’s training camp when senior Ricky
Gary and junior Antwuan Reed emerged as
starters at the cornerback position.

“ [The biggest thing I learned from] Aar-
on Berry was that getting a lot of [football]
knowledge playing corner is important. Once
you have that, you can play faster,” Reed
said. “The more you know, the easier it is
for you.”

Reed and Gary both had outstanding dis-
plays at training camp, impressing both the
coaching staff and their fellow teammates.

“I’ve just been trying to take it one day
at a time, working hard and being a part of
the team. I’ve been coming in trying to take

starter for this year’s squad.

a leadership role,” Reed said.

The Panthers’ schedule pins them against
many teams whose deep threat is their main
offensive strategy and who have great talent
at the wide—out position. For this reason,the
cornerbacks will play- an especially large role
this season. _

Reed, however, said that he is not con-
cerned about any wide receiver in particular.
Perhaps this is because both Gary and Reed
are presented daily with the opportunity to
battle the likes of wide receiverjon Baldwin
in practice. '

“LPlaying against] on] helps me out a lot
because we’re constantly competing, and he’s
one of the best guys at his position in college
football,” Reed said. ‘

Reed said that if he wants to succeed as a
comerback, he must have solid footwork and
a thorough knowledge of the game.

“In the offseason, I concentrated on
improving my footwork. It’s important to

. know formation calls and have everyone on

the same page. The more ﬁlm you are able
to watch, the more routes you will know,”
Reed said. 4

Reed is conﬁdent with the team’s depth
at the cornerback position.

, “We have a lot of guys that wantto learn,”
he said. .

He also has a lot of hope for this year’s
team, but the Panthers are taking it one step
at a time. _

“I’m most excited about getting the ﬁrst

= game on the road in,” he said. “All we’re wor—

ried aboutis preparing for Utah and taking
it one day at a time.” - e

Coach Wannstedt ready for ‘Tino’s time’ I

attention after a stellar 2009-10
campaign.

“I think he’s done a tremen-
dous job,” Palko said. “It’s nice to
have ‘someone who isn’t looking
for a job anywhere else. This is
not a stepping stone for him.”

Palko said that Wannstedt has
hired a great team of coaching as-
sistants around him for recruit-
ing purposes, and that Wannstedt
is the “perfect guy to come in_and
close the deal.”

contenders for the Big East Cham-
pionship and bowl eligibility.

Wannstedt’s commitment to

Wannstedt urges his players to
immerse themselves in all that

“The first and most impor-

Pitt’s four sets of brothers pose with Dave Wannstedt. From left to right: Nate Nix,
Andrew Taglianetti, Dom DeCicco, Derrick Burns, Dave Wannstedt, Chris Burns, Brock

Andrew starred on special teams in 2008
as a true freshman and blocked three punts.
But last year he suffered a season-ending

knee injury in the second game of the year

after starting at safety. .

Jon redshirted his freshman year and
saw. limited action in three games last year.
He is expected to see playing time at line-
backer or on special teams this season.

The twins played hockey until ninth
grade, as Their father’s hockey history gave
them a lot of access to the NHL. Although

they were very young whentheir father was '

playing for the Penguins, they often hear
stories that help them remember what it
was like.

“Going through the locker room now and
just seeing some of those guys, they always
tell us stories,” Andrew said. “J aromirjagr

‘ used to chase us around in the locker room

when we were kids.” .

“One I remember is that dad got in a
ﬁght [during a game] and my mom tells
a story like we were scared of him after,”
Jon said.

But the twins’ parents swayed them away
from hockey and toward football.

“Our parents kind of just said we gotta
start to choose one,”_]on said. “In western
PA there’s not many places you can skate,
whereas people up in Boston and Minnesota
have a rink every ﬁve miles. .

“They never gave us the ‘you can’t play,’

but you know, especially with [my dad’s‘

knowledge], and what he thought was good

DeCicco, Jon Taglianetti and Lucas Nix

for us, we chose football,” he said.
That led them to a few more sets of
brothers.  "

. Dom and Brock DeCicco

The DeCicco brothers have been playing
football together their entire lives, although
they were sometimes playing at different
levels because Dom is three years older than
Brock. The two said it’s always nice to have
each other around. A

“Whenever there’s something going

on, or just for some advice, it’s always nice 1

to have him here,” said Brock, a redshirt
freshman. '

“it’s a cool experience,” Dom, now a se-
nior, said. “Not even just on the football ﬁeld
going against him, but off the football ﬁeld
getting to hang out with him and introduc-
ing him to the college life.” '

Dom said he didn’t have to try very hard
to get his little brother to join him at Pitt af-

. ter Brock saw how successful Dom was and

how well he was treated by the University.
“[Dom] deﬁnitely liked it here so that

' deﬁnitely helped me toward coming here

knowing that he’s been here and liked it,”
Brock said. _
Dom has become a successful starter at

. strong safety for the Panthers. He had 88

tackles, three interceptions and forced a
fumble last year. Brock redshirted last year
and is expected to see action at tight end this
year, which means he will sometimes have

to go up against his brother at practice.

“This year, we went up against each other
a lot more,” Dom said. “They haven’t thrown
the ball yet at him when I was covering him,
though. He’s had to try blocking me and
it’s been fun.”

Dom said the two make each other work
a little harder.

“You can’t let the little brother ever get
the best of you,” he said.

Despite their occasional head-to-head
match-ups,Brock said he hasn’t really talked
trash with his brother, yet.

“I talk more trash with Nate on the
end.”

The DeCiccos went to Thomasjefferson
High School in Jefferson Hills with Nate
Nix, who has a brother of his own and just
so happens to be a Panther, as well.

Lucas and Nate Nix

Thomas Jefferson is a high school foot-
ball powerhouse, and it frequently plays in
the WPIAL championship game at Heinz
Field every November. It.isn’t uncommon
for T] to have many players go on to the
next level. - '

So when Nate Nix committed to Pitt in
2005 and Dom DeCicco committed in 2006,
Lucas Nix admitted that it inﬂuenced his
decision. .

' “My family and Dom’s family were close
so we grew up together and were friends

' since ﬁrst grade,” said Lucas, a junior. “We

all played football together and it just kind
of fell into place where we all had the chance
to come to the same school.”

“We pretty much all have been playing
football together since we were 6 years old,
and we won a lot of championships,” Dom
said. “It was just natural playing with each
other.” ' . ‘ ' —

- “It’s'basically like high school,” Nate,
a redshirt senior, said. “It just brings the
camaraderie that comes with us.”

The Nix brothers said their relationship
is a lot like those of the other sets of broth-
ers on the team —— they push each other.

“It keeps me motivated. I see him work-

Deciccos feed off one another

ing hard every day and I have to work a little
harder to try to show him up. We kind of just
feed off each other,” Lucas said.

Nate is entering his ﬁnal season as a
Panther and moved to defensive end last

A year after playing his ﬁrst two years as

linebacker.

He notched 20 tackles — two for loss-
es — and contributed on special teams.
He blocked a punt in the Cincinnati game,
which was eventually turned into a touch-
down. Lucas is a junior starter at right
tackle.

Naturally, with Nate being on the de-
fensive side of the ball, he often lines up
against his brother.

“I’ve been getting my fair share of my
brother this year,” Lucas said.

“It’s kind of neat,” Nate said. “Back in
high school we were always on the same
side of the ball. If we were on offense, we
both were. If we were on defense, we both
were.” '

“Now I get to release some energy and
frustrations on him,” he said. “But he’s a
good player and hopefully I’m making him
better, and at the same time he’s making
me better.”

In addition to the Nix, DeCicco and
Taglianetti siblings, Pitt got a fourth set
of brothers this year when running back
Derrick Burns joined the team as a fresh-

. man. His brother, redshirt sophomore Chris

Burns, is also a running back for the Pan-
thers. Derrick was injured, though, and
did not participate in camp this year so he
could not play collegiate football with his
brother yet. V
None of them could think of many disad-

. vantages of having a brother on the team.

The only thing Lucas Nix could think of
was that the coaches automatically come to
him if his brother is late.

“That gets on my nerves a bit,” he said.

But they all have the same goal for this
year: “Win a national championship,” Nate
said. I I

Nike unveils new Pro Combat Pitt uniforms

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

We all know that the Backyard
Brawl is a battle, but this year,
the Panthers will be ready for
combat.

Pitt was among 10 teams se-
lected to sport Nike’s new high-
performance Pro Combat uni-
forms for one special game this
year. The uniforms were designed
specifically for each school to re-

flect that university’s traditions‘

and culture.

“The Nike Pro Combat System
of Dress merges innovation and
inspiration to deliver the lightest
uniform in the industry,” Nike
spokesman Kris Aman said at
the unveiling held in New York
yesterday, according to a news
release. “They’re more than just
uniforms. They’re expressions
of pride.”

The release did not say why
Nikelchose to create the new uni-
forms or how much Pitt would
have to pay for them.

The new “system of dress” will

be worn on Black Friday when the
Mountaineers ‘visit Heinz Field.
West Virginia will also sport the
Pro Combat uniforms.

The uniforms feature blue
shirts and pants, gold numbers
and blue—and-gold shoes. The

The story of spring ball and much of the sum-

over for the departed Bill Stull. It’s a jobnthe
redshirt sophomore is more than ready for.
“I’ve focused most on the mental side of my
game in the offseason,” he said.

Dion Lewis, who has quickly become
a front runner forthe 2010 Heisman
Trophy, returns as the starting run-
ning back this year for the Panthers.
Last year, he was named Big East Of-
fensive Player of theYear and Rookie

of the Year.
Lewis resembles the perfect

combination of shiftiness and brute »

power. Last season, he scored 18
touchdowns and rushed for almost
1,799 yards on 325 carries, breaking
Tony Dorsett’s freshman record. He
rushed for more than 100 yards in

4 year, he averaged 5.7 yards per carry,

racking up a total of 349 yards on 61

Baldwin leads wide receivers

Diana Connor I For The Pitt News

Jon Baldwin, who’s received national attention, will return as a key player this season.

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬂ” Writer

This year’s Panther team is very deep at the
receiver position. Most notably, Jon Baldwin,

, widely recognized as one of the best wide re-

ceivers in the nation, stands at 6-foot-5 and
weighs in at 230 pounds. A 1,000—yard re—
ceiver last year, Baldwin stands as a potential
candidate for the Biletnikoff Award, given to
the nation’s top receiver. 4

“The wide receivers have been working
with me all summer,” Sunseri said. “[Having
conﬁdence in your wide receiving corps] is
huge, whenever we can get signals down and
we know what each otheris thinking it makes
the game run so much more smoothly.” 

Another big receiver, Mike Shanahan, will
line up as the No. 2 receiver. Shanahan, who
also stands at 6—foot—5, had a productive season
for the Panthers in 2009 and looks to build on

Once again, Pitt’s defense is expected to be
one of the best in the country. The guys up

Greg Romeus returns for his senior season

and eight sacks on his way to being named
Co-Big East Defensive Player of the Year.
Lining up at the other end of the line is

Romeus, could form the best defensive end
duo in the nation. ‘
Sheard had 42 tackles last season with
10.5 for a loss and ﬁve sacks last season.

Mike Cruz isn’t looking into the past.

The redshirt sophomore out of Bishop
McCort High School in Johnstown, Pa.,
isn’t trying to replace former Panther tight
ends and current NFL players Nate By-
ham and Dorin Dickerson. He justwants _
to make sure that one of the offense’s most
important positions doesn’t have a drop
in productivity.

“I’m not tryingto make people forget _

about ‘[Byham and Dickerson] ,” Cruz said.
“I focused a lot on the run game, my block-
ing techniques and speed. I also worked
on my route runningthis offseason so .1.

can bring back thfebest of both [Byham 1

and Dickerson] .”' ..

Cruz will be the starter this season but '

played in just 11 games last season. His only
reception was a two—yard touchdown to put
Pitt up 7-0 against South Florida. He is a
nice combination of a blocking tight end
as well as a good pass—catcher. _,

The tight end position boasts potential
depth, albeit with little experience. Red-
shirt freshman Brock DeCicco, the younger
brother of starting" safety Dom DeCicco,
has impressed people this camp.

Special teams crucial

Lucas Felak I Senior Staff Photographer

Kicker/punter Dan Hutchins enters the season as a Lou Groza Award candidate.

Saddler averaged 25.3 yards per return
on kickoffs last season, and 11.7 yards on
punt returns.

Andrews Taglianetti knows the impor-
tance of special teams, and he blocked
three punts his freshman year.

“A lot of people may overlook special
teams as just a secondary part of the game,
but it’s one third of the game,” Taglianetti
said. “One big play on special teams can
make the difference between winning or
losing.” I

Cornerbacks
impress in

training camp

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

The comerback position was one of the team’s
biggest question marks going into training camp.
After camp, however, those question marks were
set aside. 9

Pitt lost two starters from last season in
Aaron Berry andjovani Chappel. Antwuan Reed
secured his starﬁng position earlier in the spring,
whereas senior Ricky Gary and junior college
transfer Saheed Imoru had to battle for the sec-
ond starting comerbackposition. Gary emerged
early in training camp as the clear choice forthe
second starting slot and continues to improve as
he faces Baldwin every day in practice. Redshirt
junior Buddy Jackson will be the third comer-
back while freshman K’waun Williams and Imoru
will be the corners behind him. I

Taglianetti’

Safeties 4 22

“It’s [the safety’s] job to make sure everyone
is lined up properly and the right calls are
made.”

Adding depth to the strong safety position
is redshirt sophomore Andrew Taglianetti,
who started the ﬁrst two games at free safety
last year before suffering a season—ending
knee injury and receiving a medical redshirt.
He had four tackles and a fumble recovery
last seasonafter playing in all 13 games on
special teams as a freshman and blocking
three punts.

s knee OK

Penciled in to start at free safety is redshirt '

sophomorejarred Holley. Holley, originally a
comerback, switched to free safety midseason
last year after Taglianetti’s injury. He recorded
three interceptions and had several impres-
sive performances last year. Behind Holley is
redshirt freshmanjason Hendricks.

“I think it will be the best defense I have
been a part of since I’ve been here,” DeCicco
said. “There are a lot of talented guys, fast
guys and veterans to compensate for any lack
of experience.” I
