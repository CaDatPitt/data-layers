{P rocedure Cited

BY CONNIE GIEL

The sociology department
yesterday stood fast in its refusal to

release a conﬁdential report made '

by its review‘and steering
committees last week which recom-
mended a professors’ contract not
be renewed.

Department Chairman Burkart
Holzner reiterated the initial
decisions to terminate assistant
professor Paul Nyden’s appoint-

” ﬁihent and to withhold the report

until the review runs through
departmental channels.

Holzner said the decision not to
release the report conforms to
University procedures and was not
uniquely and arbitrarily imposed
upon Nyden by the sociology
department.

The review of Nyden’s work
already has undergone two stages,
inspection by an appointed three-
man committee and further scruti-
ny by an elected steering commit-
tee. The recommendation of the

ﬂspecial committee-to not renew

Nyden’s contract--was upheld by
the steering committee and
endorsed by Holzner. .

Senior sociology faculty will meet
Friday in a special session as the
next stage of the review. Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg will then be called upon
to endorse or reject their decision.

“I don't want to give the
impression l’m hiding behind the
Dean," Holzner said. “I am just
following University procedures

Sociology Chairman Burkart Holdner and a member of the steering
committee heard student demands at a sit-in at Mervis Hall yesterday

afternoon. ’

and acting under the advice of the
committees not to release the
report." .

The report would be made
available to Nyden upon receiptof
a written request, Holzner said
early yesterday, but only after the
review has been completed. Later
Holzner said “Nyden will 1'€C€iV€«3

for the dismissal at the conclusion
of the process.”

Students have been calling for
the release of the reasons for
Nyden’s dismissal for nearly two

dz/ocant SGB ‘Position

To Be Filled Tomorrow

BY MAGGIE MCKAY

The Student Government Board
.(SGB) will conﬁrmthe appoint-
ment of a new board member at
their meeting tomorrow to ﬁll a
seat which has been vacant for over
a month.

SGB President Barry Weisband
yesterday announced that Gary.
Tweed. a junior transfer student
from the Pennsylvania Institute of
Technology, will
position left vacant by former board
member Sue Turner, who resigned
February 12, two days after her
inauguration.

Tweed was selected from a ﬁeld
of 20 applicants, which "included
recent SGB presidential candidates
Larry Chaban and Joe Gronsky.

“The reasons why Tweed was
chosen were very clear cut,"
Wesiband said. “We were looking
for someone with experience .in

ealing with student government.

d
a§Tweed’s qualiﬁcations were im-

  pressive. He was far above anyone
_ else.” V 4 '

   

assume the '“

Weisband added that the Board
was anxious to have “a fresh face”
in student government. “There are
always charges that student gov-
ernment is some kind of “clique,”
Weisband said, but- the Board
wanted to insure that the applica-
tion process was open to all
students.

Tweed’s qualiﬁcations, accord-
ing to Weisband, consist of his
formation of and work with the
student government at his former
school.

‘‘I think there's a need for more
student involvement in the Univer--
sity." Tweed said. “Students need
to be more aware of their rights and
responsibilities. They aren't told
the reasons behind many decisions.
For example, The University hasn't
really said what is the purpose of
raising tuition, and students often
don't know what steps to take when
dealing with the administration.”

Five of the six current ‘board
members must approve Tweed’s
appointment at tomorrow’s meet-

ing». .

Students remained in Holzner’s
ofﬁce from 10 a.m. till nearly seven
p.m., and left only when a Campus

room.

Early in the afternoon, the

the hearing and voting sessions.

Angelou Coptivotes Audience .

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

Maya Angelou strolled on
stage, scrutinized her audience,
and set the stage for her
denunciation of racial discrimina-
tion in today's society.

“If she could see her image in
the lake, dancing under palm trees
naked, she would know she is
beautiful. But city streets have no
palm trees, and dishwater gives no
reflection," recited Angelou, one
of three speakers at the Black
Action Society’s “Focus on Black
Women” program held Monday in
the S.U.B. Ballroom.

Angelou is a dramatist, a poet,
and an author who uses all her
resources to captivate an audience.

“In 1619, urn. year before the
landing of the Mayﬂower, the first
blacks came to America," Angelou
huffed, sitting on the edge of her
chair and stifling a grin.

' America's practice of chattel
slavery nursed a nation of
strangers, said Angelou, who, with
tear-choked voice, read another of
her poems.

Disputed Union Ballots

Dropped By Agreement  

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Sixty-four contested ballots left
over from the faculty union election
were thrown out -by mutual
agreement on Monday, leaving the
Pitt Professional Union (PPU) in
the runner-up slot and assuring
them a place in the March 30 and

'31 Provost area run-off elections.

The ballots were contested
because of questions concerning
the eligibility of the individuals

' who cast them in the election held

on March 9 and 10.

Because of the close count
between the PPU, which drew 239
votes, and the American Associa-
tion of University Professors
(AAUP), which drew 228, the
possibility existed that some of the
contested ballots, if found eligible,
could have awarded the runner-up

.- slot to the AAUP.»

With the agreement to throw out
the contested ballots, the PPU will
face the No Representative option
in the Provost area run-off.

In other union news, representa-
tives from two unions vying to
become the sole representative of
support personnel at Pitt met with
University lawyers to attempt to
sketch out procedures for an
upcoming union election.

The hearing was postponed
becuase of complications over the
ﬁnal list of names—of individuals
fitting into the agreed job
categories. The University did not
submit the ﬁnal list, so State Labor

Board hearing examiner ‘Sidney

Lawrence postponed the meeting

until Friday. .
On Friday, the parties "will

reconvene to consider the lists,

provided by the University. At that
time the Association of Federal,

State and County Municipal Em-"' “ 7

ployes (AFSCME), which is inter-
vening on the pre-election proce-

dure, will produce any testimony:

required to change the bargaining * -

unit layed out by the University and '
the University of Pittsburgh Sup-V "

port Personnel Association

(UPSPA) an affiliate of the-

Pennsylvania State Education As-
sociation (PSEA).
The original

petition‘ for a ;

support personnel union election - » 
was ﬁled jointly by the University . 

administration and UPSPA. As_an

‘intervener, AFSCME was required A
by state law to produce evidence ‘
that at least 10% ofthe people ‘in

the bargaining unitdescribed in" 

the original petition supported V
. AFSCME inclusionin the election A

and ‘AFSCME’s presenceyat tli,‘ it

done by soliciting signatures.

If AFSCME wishes to make any
changes in the original petition,»
however, it must produce signa-

professionals. at Pitt may also

the faculty voting must remain

closed. .

Nyden has sent three letters to
Holzner that he claims constitutes
written requests for the report. He
said the contents of the report
probably will show the decision to
have been made on political rather
than academic or scholarly
grounds. I

“My politics of the. past and
present were not 'looked upon
favorably,” Nyden said. “I make
no secret I’m sympathetic to
unions, especially the United Mine
Workers (UMW).” He said several
Board of Trustee members repre-
sent steel and coal companies and
may have coerced the committees
into terminating his contract.

Lou Antal, president of the
UMW’s Pittsburgh chapter, sent a

letter Monday to Holzner in which”
he claimed Board members George I

Love of Consolidation Coal Com-
pany and.R. Heath Larry of U.S.
Steel “may have exerted pressure
to get_ rid of Dr. Nyden.” Antal
pledged -support of Nyden and
asked his contract be renewed.
“I was told by Holzner my
teaching didn't enter into this at
all,” Nyden said. “I think it should

"be .a major part of a faculty

review.” -
Holzner denied this, saying the
review considered Nyden’s acade-
mic work in its totality. “The
committee did provide us with
information about his teaching.
Student opinion was assessed,”
Holzner said. , I
Neither Holzner nor members of
the review committee would say
how or when students had been
contacted.
j.Linda Nyden, Paul Nyden’s‘wife,
insisted the department’s behavior
is causing a crisis in conﬁdence

Nyden Denied Dept. '5 Report:

among students. “There is no way
you can keep doing_this and hope to
rebuild the good faith of students,”
she said.

“It is highly unusual for this
department not to renew a contract

of a junior faculty member at this v

level, before a tenure level,”
Nyden'said.

“In the past 10 years, no one has
had this happen to him in this
department,” he added. Holzner
confirmed the decision to terminate
Nyden’s contract was in that sense
unprecedented.

“So essentially, I’ve been told
my work is of lower quality than

anyone else’s in the past 10 years,” ~

Nyden said.

Early last year, Nyden’s work
was reviewed by a different
three-mancommittee, hersaid, and
received full approval. “Have the
standards changed so much since
then?” he asked. “Or how else
could, this * turnaround be
explained?” A

According to Nyden, .the Colum-
bia University department of
sociology awarded him a _PhD with

distinction in 1974 without requir-i

ing an oral defense.
Nyden has been in Pitt’s
sociology department since Janu-

V ary, 1973. His current appointment

will expire in April, next year. The
committee’s recommendation is, in
effect, to not offer Nyden a second
three-year contract. He would be
eligible for tenure in another three
years. ‘ ,

The faculty handbook states
termination of an appointment for

'cause—which means other than

expiration of a.contract—allows the
faculty member in question to call
fora hearing and to be informed of
the reasons for the termination.
The handbook further says a

 The Nyden Secret

Whether Dr. Paul Nyden of the sociology department has been ﬁred,

v as ‘his supporters claim, or he has not, as sociology department

Chairman Burkart Holzner claims, there is a reason to believe the
assistant professor is on his way out.

 an employer, it is the University’s right to ‘hire and fire their

‘ ' employes, but it is also the right of those employes, in this case Nyden,

to know why. .
Students ‘have demanded to know why non-renewal of Nyden’s
contract has been recommended, but Holzner has continually denied
thatrequest, claiming University procedure must be followed. And
- that means, he continues, that the report from the review and steering
committee will not be released. . A
It is possible the department has good cause to not want to renew

‘ ,:'Nyden’s contract, but the secrecy surrounding that cause does little to

convince students this action is being taken for reasons other than
those some have charged. It has been alleged that Nyden’s ‘ﬁring’ is

S due to his support of union movements, both on- and oﬁ’-campus, or
' due to attacks against Nyden’s view on a local radio station.

If politi-.s of that sort did enter into the decision, the department is
clearly wrong. If it didn’t, as they insist, some proof must be made
available. I

It is hard to understand why the administrators involved would not
be willing, in fact eager, to prove the charges wrong, especially not

< that the local media has taken an interest in the issue, creating a

situation potentially damaging to the University’s image.
Hard to understand, that is, unless they are trying to hide
something.

On Cutting Carnegie

Allegheny County’s slash-happy commissioners are about to lower
the ax on yet another public service, despite the fact that county
residents and Pittsburgh’s college population will be none too pleased.

The decision expected tomorrow on how severely cut Carnegie
Library county appropriation will be comes after a week’s delay that
may beneﬁt the library’s defenders. ' . ‘

Since the three commissioners announced their intention to reduce
Carnegie’s funding by 20-25%, each has received about 200 phone
calls in protest, along with letters numbering in thethousands.

VV1th the anticipated cut, James M. Walton, president of the library,
armounced that the following series of austerity measures are under
consideration:

———closing the Allegheny County Regional Reference Library _

—-—reducing by up to 12% the Central branch’s operating hours and
up to 25% the hours at other branches

———imposing a hiring ﬁeeze

-—-curtailing Central and branch prograrmning

—reducing library staff. -

Carnegie Library is an important source for students attending area
colleges and universities. Pitt students, in particular, often use
Carnegie as a second library because of it on-campus location and its
proximity to Hillman Library. V

_ Camegie’s various suburban branches also offer smooth access for
the many commuters who attend an urban university the size of Pitt.

We understand that the commissioners have the county's best
interest at heart in trying to trim the fat from the budget, but when
Carnegie has to entertain such self-limiting options "as reducing hours

» and laying off staff, perhaps the commissioners should look elsewhere

. .j for some less essential “fat.”

VV1th this prospect, we feel that the commissioners’ ﬁscal pruning of
the library’s budget steps out of the realm of public service and
actually works to the detriment of those taxpayers whose money is
being appropriated. - ‘ S

BY MARY LOU MIKULA

Pursuant to the furor surround-,
ing the “ﬁring” of Dr. Paul Nyden
of the sociology department, two
important factors must be discus-
sed. The first concerns the speciﬁc
interests of the students in this
action.

The preliminary decision not to .

renew Nyden’s contract was made
by a steering committee of
sociology faculty, with the concur-
rence of department chairman Dr.
Burkhart Holzner. While addition-
al steps in the ﬁring process are yet
to be completed, the fact is that the
department’s recommendation car-
ries the most weight in this
procedure, and for all practical
purposes the decision has been
made.

~More importantly, none of the
steps in this “University proced-
ure” provide for the voicing of
students’ wishes, needs, or (ex-
pert) opinion. Last Friday’s

vociferous appearance in Holzner’s .

ofﬁce demanding to know the
“reasons why” and voicing their
support for Nyden testiﬁes to the
obvious need for student input
regarding faculty contract renew-
als. _

While the practice of “judgment

A by peers” is recognized as common

to most_professions, the University
must recognize that the students in
this instance are the customers,

If this recognition
must result in revamping the
University procedure on faculty
contracts, then so be it—it is an
improvement long overdue.

The Student

Your editorial of March 8 makes
a point of lack of student
participation in the unionization of
faculty and at the faculty-admini-
stration bargaining table. Students
do not belong in a faculty union
because they do not have the same
interests as faculty. ‘

The Ameri

Universities could conceivably
exist without either faculty or
administrators (indeed, much of
the learning that goes on in
yeshivot, schools of higher learning
in Talmud, is done by students
studying with each other) but they
could not exist without students.

You do have a point in making
claims for students’ presence at the
bargaining table. As the employ-

their presence must make itself

The question to be answered,
however, is, who is to represent
them? The poor showing in SGB

involvement in student affairs.

Dr. Paul Nyden’s contract has terminated as of April 30, 1977. A secret report, endorsed by the De-

distinction in May, 1974 — entitled MINERS FOR DEMOCRACY: STRUGGLE IN THE COAL
FIELDS. His ‘five-person Columbia committee commented that it "far exceed in amount and maturity
of work almost any other dissertation anyone had been sitting in judgment or before."

it. is claimed that Dr. Nyden’s work. is biased because he s_o strongly supports the United Mine Workers .
in their struggle against the coallfcompanies. The Chairman of the Department, on the other hand, is a

consultant to Westinghouse Electric and the U.S. Air Force.

Dr. Nyden is the only labor sociologist in the department. He has spoken out strongly‘-against racism in

the University. And he waspublicly opposed the presence of ROTC on the campus. We believe these

are the reasons he has been fired.

The six-man steering committee reflects a general trend at the University
of Pittsburgh to severely repress any thoughts 0? 3°t1°“5 Whlch are “°t
in the "conservative" mold.

The blatant refusal of the Sociology Departmént t° T¢1e85° the steer"
ing committee's report and also the consistent eftortstof 3:; Eugtiﬁzu
Holzner, the department Chairman, to circumvent studen pa df P the ..
in the issue are indicative of the’ veil of secrecy surroun _ng

' whole affair.

Clearly, Dr. Nyden cannot effectively defend himself without know-

ledge of the specific criticisms being made about his 3¢8§emi¢ W°rk'

The criticisms (which are documented in the steering_comittee report)
have been withheld by virtue of University rules that stipulate that they
cannot be released without the Dean's approval. We Challenge the eQ“1tY

In our city with so many industrial workers and union members we need

Doris Welcher, chairman of the

the program, said blacks have been

Welcher said that black children

But schools still dictate white

“We really haven’t changed our

“Teaching race is like teaching

Consequently, the child inter-

If the answers to these three questions are yes, Air Force ROTC
may have a program that fits your needs.

Each year the Air Force is authorized to award 50 two year schol-
arships to students who are pursuing degrees in nursing. The selec-
tion process is national in scope with the best qualified applicants
being identified for scholarships. The scholarships cover full tui-
tion, books, fees, plus $100 per month tax free for the duration of
the scholarship. Upon graduation, scholarship recipients are given
up to eight months to complete licensing requirements. Upon li-
censing, the nurse begins a 4-year obligation as an Air Force Nurse.

With few exceptions, Air Force nurses have the same functions
and responsibilities as the nurse in civi|ian'practice. A major differ-

} encieris that Air Force nurses are also Air Force officers. ln add-
tion, they assist in the evaluation of patients by air. Othen/vise, Air _

Force nursing, like all nursing, has as its objective comprehensive
patient-centered care. It ispconcerned with the prevention of dis-
ease and injury through education and information, as well as the
care of the sick and injured. In return for these responsibilities, Air
Force nurses are well paid. You will start at a salary equivalent to
$11,000 and be earning over $18,000 per year by the 4-year point
(assuming normal progression). Additionally, you may have the
opportunity to acquire speciality training at Air Force expense.

If you have at least a 2.5 cumulative grade point average and feel that you are interested in obtaining

Tight Blues

BY NORM MARTELLO

Tom Waits bounded to the stage
' and removed his overcoat, reveal-
ing’ a wrinkled Saturday seersucker.
special. “I wanna pull on your coat
about something,” he said in his
raspy, ﬂu-plagued voice as the trio
struck up a number that ‘trans-
formed the S.U. Lower Lounge into
a smoky supper club on the
mythical South Side of town. His
bruised ego spoke of an aborted
attempted pick-up of a woman who
' was “so ugly she'd make a freight

 

train take a dirt road.” This last of v

 four performances last Saturday
 night

showed Waits at his
_. __ bawdiest.
 - “Under the circumcision it was a

real prophylactic experience. So, I
ordered up some cleaning pro-
ducts, y’knoooow...vodka, orange
juice, Folger’s coffee...’s called a
, ., _ ‘Screw Mrs. Olson’...” he sang as
the crowd howled with laughter.
’ ‘ “Nothing to worry about,”
Waits told his trio, “cause we got a
tasteless audience tonight. ”

The opening monologue led into
“Emotional Weather Report,”
through which Waits scat-sang his
words and stretched-out his
vowels, while his cool-style tenor
saxophonist Frank McCary
stretched notes. As musical as the
late novelist Jack Kerouac’s book
Desolation Angels, Waits’ writing
achieves added melody from the
use of his voice as a musical
intrument.

. Waits’ hottest set drove both
b_and and crowd to speed-jive
frenzy. Most of the songs were
preceded by a monologue, acknow-

ledging his growing interest in the
spoken word.

“Eggs and Sausage” showed his
love affair with words and rhythm
in city images and scenic construc-
tion. It was an early morning
montage at a diner, Emma’s 49er,
as “...the waitress sings/eggs and
sausage and a side of toast/coffee
and a roll, hash browns over
easy/chili in a bowl with burgers
and fries/what kind of pie?” His
feet moved over the piano pedals
like he was two-footin’ a Buick

Improvisations in tight blues and

Roxy Music Means

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Carnegie-Mellon University’s
gymnasium is traditionally used for
sweaty basketball games or physi-
cal education elective courses. But
just as a beautiful painting can
brighten the mood of a drab room,
Roxy Music elegantly changed this
“jock palace” into a musical
extravaganza.

Roxy Music has been drawing
rave record and concert reviews in
England since their inception in
1971, but this American tour seems
to be the first time that it is making
’.any.headway in the states. Its
music, presentation, and image
have always been extremely
mature and unconventional.

It is unconventional in that it
borrows from many different

A people, eras, and places. On
Sunday night it played a collage
of 1940’s swing jazz, pop,

American disco, and driving yet
calculated English hard rock,
(which borders on the progressive)
- with each of the six members of the
band adding stage ﬂavor to the

  

musical broth, in an expression
that is totally original.

Opening with “Sentimental
Fool” the band immediately
captured the era of the smoky

Diego Serenade,”—“I never spoke

I loved you till I cursed you in.

vain/ Never felt my heart strings till
I nearly went insane.”. 

Waits’ cynicism was exempliﬁed
with the lyrics “Fumblin’ With the
Blues/and it’s hard to win when
you always lose/Well, the night
spots spend your spirit/Beat your

‘head against the wall/Two dead

ends and you’ve still

_‘ ‘Nighthawk Postcards,’ ’ con-
ceived while standing “on the
corner of Why-don’t—you-leave-me
and Why-don’t-you-please-come-
,home...on the corner of Fifth and
Vermouth,” “Better Off Without a
Wife,” and “The Heart of
Saturday Night” elicited calls for
an encore. '
The encore numbers brought the
crowd back to .normalcy. The
elegant love ballad “Rosie”
preceded “Putnam County,” one

Waits gives the impression of a

vocal was akin to that of an English -
balladeer. It's timbre blends the V

vocal styles of British folk and
blues guitarist John Renbourn,
balladeer Tom Rush and Jethro
Tull’s leader, Ian -Anderson.

While he sang songs of hope and
pain, his best of the evening was a
Bachian instrumental. “Back Is”
opened with a single-picking blues
that «sounded like a mixture of

harpsichord and Spanish guitar.

detective thriller, changed to ‘ 

futuristic Clockwork Orange muzak
with “The Thrill of it All,” and
then journeyed back to the present
with the AM disco hit, “Love is the
Drug."

Lead singer Bryan Ferry is the
band’s titan combining the mus-
tachioed dark English looks of an
Errol Flynn, Bogart’s cigarette
cool, and the mannerisms of a
young Sinatra. Ferry was calm and
debonair, and displayed a vocalist

style on “Sentimental Fool,” R

“Both Ends Burning,” and “Bit-
ter-Sweet," that makes him stand
out in any crowd of 1976 rock
crooners. .
While Ferry dominated center
stage. he is by no means the only
shining light in the band. Roxy
played an hour and a half set giving
the other members time to amply
display their musical prowess.

' “The Seagull” was written at the
Jersey shore where he “discovered
how it feels to be lonely—the
morning after/as I walked on the
beach/ a lonely seagull called/ ‘Fall
into the sea./ Fall into the sea.”

While the applause was strong
and friendly, it was obvious that
Waits’ admirers were awaiting
their man. '

Charles “Big Daddy” Bukowski,
from the Los Angeles literary
scene, broke even in terms of
crowd reaction. Friday night’s late
show found the poet hassled and
heckled, but he fared better on
Saturday. '

Bukowski was rough-faced. A
sparse beard decorated his 55 year
old countenance. He looked as if
he had seen years of pain on the
open road, occasionally soothed by
a cool gulp of Budweiser and a soft
skid row bed. Belching through his

approximately hour-long perfor-

mance he downed six Buds, his
guzzling bringing rounds of ap-
plause.

Two of his best during the
reading were “The White Poet”

‘and “The Black Poet,” stories of

young poets coming to him for

praise and approval. Instead he
criticized: “...they are rhymers,
full of/platitudes. You write

bad/poetry...and it's useless to tell
you that I am not/anti-black/be-

Waits ‘is
accessible of the two. He is a,
young performer in ‘a popular
medium with a catchy style;
pleasant, rhythmical with familiar
images. Bukowski has literary
references in his poetry and makes
use of poetic structures. Unfortu-
nately, little of this surfaced during
his bawdy Saturday night perfor-
mance. ‘

Hls sighing and even-paced
droning was not dramatic as would
ggéche delivery of a poet who was
., __ing to win over his listeners.
Often poetry does not feed your
mind effortlessly, ‘but rather

demands attention and reflection.

Hls Saturday show, on the other
hand, was easily understood and
was appreciated by most of the
college crowd.

“Any questions?” Bukowski

asked, as he did after every poem.

“Yeah, why don’t you get off,” a
heckler hollered from the back.
“Do you call that poetry? What do
you think you’re doing up there?”

‘;If,ever get far enough ahead,
 see me up here,” the old
man replied.

“What do you like more, your
beer or your poetry?” the heckler
continued. .

“I like my poems better than

yours.” The crowd cheered.

“Another dirty shot from the old
boy.”‘ He swigs his Bud. “Tough
company. You think this is easy,
don’t you? It is,” Bukowski said
with a sly grin as he successfully

— protected his turf.

One poem‘he didn't read was
“The Poetry Reading” from
Mockingbird Wish Me Luck:
“scrabbling for pennies in tiny
dark halls/reading poems I have
long since become tired of.”
Bukowski’s whole performance was
the message. “...and I used to
think/ that men who drove buses/ or
cleaned latrines/or murdered men
in alleys were/fools.”

Bukowski has written better

poems than those he recited
Saturday night. Why didn't he
present his best? ‘

Perhaps Saturday’s performance
was a primal scream in hopes of a

response or interst of some kind ‘’

from a sense-deadened, dream-de-
feating, money-grubbing, speed-
ridden America. Or perhaps the
poetry of Charles Bukowski and the
song of Tom Waits was more a
despondent groaning of a helpless
and love-ﬁlled acceptance of our
culture. If you’re blinded by your
vision of reality and would like to
peek’ at another. ..try‘ some. "

AN OPEN LETTER FROM THE
FACULTY MEMBERS or THE PPU

  

- TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE

  AAUP AND THE PSEA

March 17, 1976
Dear Colleagues, if ‘V A A

We invite all of you who are members or supportersof the AAUP or the PSEA
to join with us to bring collective bargaining;n'o"w to area at the University of
Pittsburgh. A vote for "no representation" wi~ll.*n.o1;4 .b.e‘in theiinterest of the Pitt faculty,
It will leave us vulnerable to even greater cutbacks and abuses than we are already
experiencing. ‘

“The faculty members of the PPU respect your affiliation with and work for the 
AAUP and the PSEA. Membership in the PPU is not necessary to help bring victory for
collective bargaining. g _ i_/_

In our FACULTY UNITY PROPOSAL we promised to establish a joint Faculty
Contract Committee and Faculty Negotiation Committee composed of representatives
of the PPU, AAUP and PSEA. This promise will be honored. if

We need your help and support in a joint campaign to win collective bargaining
on March 30-31. A majority of us have expressed our feelings in favor of collective bar-
gaining. We can go forward together to begin to deal with our problems through’
collective bargaining‘.

" Sincerely,

The Pitt Professional Union

“Coming offthe ﬁnal turn, Karl ,

speed to power past his opponents
to win the heat. (New Mexico's)

where the place in the heat, and not

Inexperience on the tight ‘board

‘tend to -force runners wide off the
turns where a more experienced
runner can make up time staying
close to the inside. The Villanova

  AMatter Of Depthj    

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

There was a quality, a certain
something, that separated last,
year’s Panther swimming squad,
the squad that ﬁnished second to
Maryland in the Eastern Swimming
and Diving Championships, from
this year’s Eastern Champs.

A characterization of both teams

_ uldn’t reveal that difference:

"".;;'th entries were dedicated,
talented, and surprisingly competi-
tive-. The personnel on both squads
was essentially the same, with the
exception of a few freshmen.

But indeed, those freshmen
made the difference between
second-place ﬁnish, 50 points off
the mark, and a 144 points margin

' he extra

 

Jr; R

 
   

quality is depth, and this season,
the Panthers had some runners-up
who could well be stars for other
Eastern schools.

So, the freshmen didn’t come out
andtakeeover positions as “top
dog.” But those positions, ‘now in
the grasps of the DeMuro’s, the
Civis’, the Natali’s and the
Miller’s, are quickly gaining
support from the ‘kind of back-up
talent that'the Panthers will be
blessed__with for years to come.

It's that kind of depth that wins
the championships. Pitt won its
share of ﬁrsts, seconds and thirds
at last year’s Easterns. But it was
the immediate contributions of

‘people like «Bill Moser, Orlando

Catinchi, Jeff Shaffer, Bill Wagner
and Mike Nelson that made this
year’s Eastern championship a
reality. And made the promise of

many more Eastern titles a_

certainty. *

This isn’t to say the old timers
didn’t have their heyday at this
year’s event. Jerry DeMuro was
truly remarkable, winning two of
the most grueling events in the
competition. If you don't think so,
try completing a mile in the pool,
and doing it in a meet record 15:57.

.“Sure, I’m really pleased about ..

my win in the 1,650,” DeMuro
said, “but I have to be more
pleased with the team champion-
ship. This is what we've worked
hard for all season, and it’s nice to
-set such high goals and see them
through.”

For his efforts, DeMuro ‘was
named the tournament's outstand-

1:} Wrestlers Disappointed
With Their NCAA Showing

4 BY JIM LEWIS

So close and yet so far.

The Pltt wrestling team A was
nationally ranked, holding down
the 19th spot after the completion
of dual meet competition. A :

Hopes of climbing higher in the
Top Twenty grew in the hearts of
the Panthers and Head "Coach-
Dave Adams.

And Pitt was close to turning

a A ose hopes into reality, sending

"-hive of its top wrestlers—Kevin
Nellis, Bob Bailey, Bill Bailey,
Rande Stottlemyer, and George
O’Korn—to the NCAA champion-
ships in Tuscon, Arizona over the
weekend and making a serious bid
to climb into the Top Ten.

But it was not to be.

Poor wrestling and terrible
officiating plagued the Panthers,
according to Adams, as all ﬁve Pitt
wrestlers failed _to qualify for the

ﬁnals, thus dropping Pitt out of the g

I

elite Top Twenty. v
The Panthers could only muster

ﬁve team points.

?'''‘‘We didn’t do very well as 'a
whole." Adams said afterwards,

3/   ' V v  ,, 

“or as.well as we had been.”
In the event, Nellis (118 pounds)

. and All-American Stottlemyer (134

pounds) were the most successful.
Nellis won his first two matches
before ﬁnally losing to one of last
year’s champions, while Stottle-
myer, after losing his first match,
‘bounced’ back to take two victories
before losing and thereforepfailin ,
to qualify. '
Bob Bailey (142 pounds), Bill
Bailey (190 pounds), and George
O’Korn (167 pounds) lost their
opening match and were elimi-
nated from further competition.

The warm sun and fun of Tuscon _

may have played a part in the
wrestlers’ performances, not to
mention the fantastic pressure of
such a prestigeous event. But

according to Adams, the big factor .

contributing to Pitt’s mediocre
showing was the ofﬁciating.

“We were victimized by the
ofﬁcials," Adams claimed. “And
it wasn't just our guys. Other
wrestlers were victims of very bad
ofﬁciating. Itwas the worst job__ of
officiating __ l’ve ‘ ever seen.”

ing swimmer M

Then there was the seasoned
veteran of the springboards, Jeff
Miller, who went into the tourney
hoping to defend his one-meter
championship of last year. Miller
did more and more.

He won the one-meter, as was
expected, with teammate Tom
Fatyol finishing second. Then,
entering the three-meter ﬁnals a
distant third, he put together a
superb effort and captured the
three-meter title as well and was
named the meet’s outstanding
diver. '

Fatyol, whose excellence on the
high board netted- him the

three-meter crown last year (as?

well 'as the tournament’s diving
.award), ﬁnished a distant sixth and

failed to qualify for the NCAA .

tournament. ,
“I’m very pleased with our

divers as a team,” said Coach Al

Coffey. “I knew Jeff was capable of

the performance he_ gave us. But-
I’m concerned with Tom Fatyol. He ~

was .our only disappointment.) I
have, to give Miller, Reeder, and
Shaffer a lot of credit, they didia
good job.” _

And so goes the 1975-76
swimming season. But if you think

the tankers were tough, wait until.

you see what happens next year.

WATER 1>oLo COMES TO PITT

. Water polo has been classiﬁed
as a chieﬂy West Coast sport—the
U.S. Olympic team is an all-Cali-
fornia gang.

Pitt has one of those ex-All-
American water polo players from
the national powerhouse, San Jose
State, taking care of coaching and
recruiting. Miguel Rivera, a
doctoral student in exercise phy-
siology, has put‘ together a team

that is giving headaches to every‘

coach in the East.

Playingfor the first time ever in
the Eastern Collegiate .Water Polo
Conference, the team‘ placed third
this year in the Eastern champion-
ships. Its season record wasian
impressive 16-4.

‘ ‘Since it was our first year in the
league, we had a tough schedule
with no home games,” Rivera said.
“We played Cornell, Fordham,
Villanova, Syracuse, Columbia,
Edinboro, Slippery Rock and
Yale—the top teams in the East.
All these teams have varsity status;
we are the only club in the
conference.” , ~

Pitt willhost the All-American
Water Polo Invitational starting
next Friday at 3 p.m. at the Trees
Pool, with the Panthers in the
opening game. The second contest
is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.
Admission is free.

Only teams with four or more
All-American players on their
rosters qualify for this tournament.
It is an opportunity to see some of
the nation's best players before the
selection ‘of the ﬁnal squad to

< represent the U.S. at the Olympic

Games in Montreal.

T = _ Associate Sports Editor
For many area hockey fans, the Pitt Hockey Club’s 9-7-1 record may
appear mediocre. But the opposite is true, because the Panthers

dumped most bf their lowly competiton and moved on to more talented _

adversaries, and this season could "well be labeled the best in Pitt
hockey history. ~ V I ’

Gone are the days of 20-0 and 18-1 conquests in the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Hockey Association (WPIHA), which
possessed teams whose players could not break into the Pitt lineup.
Panther eradications of St. Francis. or St. Vincent were good ‘for a

laugh, but did nothing to better the Pitt hockey program.
The 19-2-1 and .19-3-2 records Pitt racked up in the ‘WPIHA during

the past two years may never be repeated, but it doesn’t matter—the . .

Panthers are looking for quality in their opposition and not quantity in
the number of goals they can tally against hapless adversaries.

The Hockey Club went searching for better competition and put ’
together: probably its most,balanced schedule since the team’s --

inception ﬁve years ago. The Panthers again linedup three New York
teams—Nassau, Iona and .Wagner Colleges—the Naval Academy,
Penn State and.Ohio University to form a respectable card, not one
which included games in which the fans start exiting after Pitt’s 15th
oal. ' ~ ~
g Perhaps the only mistake in this ‘year’s schedule was the inclusion of
the University of Cincinnati,.which demolished Pitt on three occasions,

pl-'o_r Hockey Club

_,out-scoring the Panthers 32-8, including a 8-0 thrashing at the " 

Sewickley Arena. But, on the other hand, the.’ appearance of

Carnegie-Mellon (C-MU) and Duquesne Universities (old WPIHA foes) '

‘km the schedule gave the Panthers a chance to get all their players into‘
some games, but a surprise 2-1 loss to Duquesne spoiled an otherwise

successfulseason against inter-city rivals. Pitt -won two games from '

both Duquesne and C-MU. '
’ Coach Len Barcalow should be proud of his team and also of himself.
For a man who does not get paid for his efforts, Barcalow puts in a lot
of hours getting his team ready and directing it through the tedious
action. When the team ran out of funds during mid-season,‘ Barcalow,
who works at the North Park skating rink, got the team free ice time on
Monday nights so the players could stay in shape and not lose the
cohesiveness of lines they worked so hard to build. Talkative and often
out-spoken, Barcalow has much to say about the past season. ‘ y
“I thought the season went well,” he said. “We all expected to win
three or four more games, and there’s a little air of disappointment

because we didn’t come up with,"maybe-, a 13-3 season. I_didn’t expect . I

the three losses to Cincinnati. But it wasn't a disappointing season.
With a little luck here and there we could have gotten a couple more
wins. Even though it's a. club, the school should really be proud of this
team. We haven't had a losing season yet.

We owe a lot to Bob Montgomery and Bob 1<.lem (assistant

I coaches), Dan Warrick and Jay Irrgang, the trainer. Because of them,

" we had a successful season. The Panther as usual was out of sight. He 1

never lost the puck out there all season. Not once." , \
Barcalow’s pet peeve is the lack of large home crowds and the lack of

‘ ‘recognition from V the University, and‘ especially the athletic J

.1 .'-department. Barcalow has been known to endlessly praise his players _
and has a_ valid reason to” be proud of them... In Rick Vernon... he has ’ I
possibly the best amateur hockey player in Western Pennsylvania and .

in Larry Newill, the best goalkeeper in this area. Newill’s performance
against._Penn State last Sunday was the best I have ever seen by an
amateur netminder. And Russ Stump, Pitt’s » “defenseman’s

defenseman” has provided the Panthers with a tough policeman who’ -1

_makes Newill’s job much easier. - _
The Panthers are losing only one player to graduation—hip check

specialist Mike McDermott—so, with the nucleus of a talent-laden club» I

to build on, Pitt can look ahead to even greater success in hockey. It's a‘
shame the athletic department (a contributor‘ of $1,000 to the team,this
season) does not show more concern for this winning club.
