  Advising  CAS Studied

by DAVE MAJERNIK

An ad hoc committee studying
undergraduate advising in the
CAS. ‘chaired .by Dr. Norinan
Austern of Physics. made its ini-
tial report at the FAS meeting on
Feb. _27 after almost a years in-

.I___;‘ vestigation.

‘ i ‘Undergraduate advising has two
basic phases. according to the re-
repoi“t. First, major boardadvis-

ing- for students who have de- -
clared majors is conducted by the.

individuaracademic departments.
Secondly. lower board advising.
for studentswhoihave not declar-
ed majors. is conducted by the Ad-
vising Center. a semi-autono-,
mous branch of the CAS office.
The report said information was

gathered by means of a question-
naire to_students, extensive dis-
cussions with-the director of the
Advising Center, and an inter-
view with the CAS Dean.

From the questionnaires. the re-
export concluded that "students be-
 lieve advising should play an im-
portant part in their academic
development and in their adjust-
ment tp university life. They also

believe that the advising they re-"

ceive does not measure up to
these expectations.” "

The report continues. “Upper-

classmen especially complain

1 that in their encounters with the

Center they often were rushed

through registration- with little

time to discuss their academic in-

terests or life at the university.

They frequently recall their ad-

visors as .  little more than sig-
nature machines."

In summary, though the report

said that the Advising.Center

.,, ,“seems to be a fundamentally

sound organization, which dis-
charges a very vague and diffi-
cultjob.” _
Some recommendations were
made to improve the Advising
Center: (1! the Career Planning
Division of the Counseling Center

‘ should be moved to the Advising

Center: t2» major bulletin board
space should be set aside in the
lobby of the Advising Center.
where the academic departments
‘can put notices that remind stu-
dents of their requirements and
of the opportunities they offer‘;
i3i more faculty presence at the
Advising Center: and t4) liason
with each department should be
improved by giving each academ-
ic area some representation
among the advisers.

‘About ‘major advising. the re-

» port said its "greatest failure is

in providing.information about the
rest of the college. Students say
major advisers do not inform
them ‘about’ various non—depart-
mental options."

“Consistency is‘ also important

.in adviser-student contact.

Even the largest department
ought‘ to be able to provide the
secretarial support needed for
students to make appointments
with the same adviser each term.
But even students who do nor-
mally see the same adviser each
term’ declare they want more con-
tinui_ty. We presume this means
that the adviser_ forgets them
from one term to the next. Bet-
ter records . . . would be useful,”
the report continued.

The report suggests that ma-

jor advisers feel their job is not

greatly valued by their depart-
ments. .

Proposal to end secret decisions

Tenure Debated  FAS

by ROB OBENREDER '
A proposal to end secret tenure and pro_motion decisions at the
University was submitted to the Facul_v of Arts and Sciences «FAS» at
a recent meeting by Dr. Florencio G. Asenjo of the Matlieiiiatics De-

partment.

Asenjo claims that secret committees designed to advise the FAS

Dean on promotion and tenure matters do not provide an objective
viewpoint. but actually "shelter irresponsibility."

 ‘_‘It is in the interest of the University and is the right of individuals

to be considered with a maximum of objectivity  .

secrecy does not

increase this objectivity,” Asenjo said during an interview.

"The person being considered doesn‘t know what is being said

about him or who is making_the evaiuatioiis. The faculty wants to he .

sure they are not being refused tenure because of such things as per-

sonality conflicts." claims Asenjo.

'l‘herei'ore. in his proposal. Asenjo asks that "the Dean terminate
the secret status of the isecret advisory» committees in question."
because they are "inconsistent with the proper and responsible op-

, eration of a university. Secret committees subvert the ‘principles or ac-
countability to which every member of the University is subject."

In a preface to the proposal, he states that “it has been claimed
that the entire matter is ultimately irrelevant, since the Dean is the

~ person who, really makes decisions on such issues. But, if jjithese}-7Com-

_mittees have

   

 

no impact whatsoever onthe_Dean’s decisi‘on:S',"iVVﬁy‘, _h.a‘vefl

. —"Centralize

  

Austern explained. "The de-
partments are not answerable to
anyone for what they do in major
advising.“ He added that there
was a need for more uniform pro-
cedures so that each new advi-
ser and each department would
not have to invent their own ad-
vising procedures. A

Summary recommendations of
the report for major advising
were: - -
—"lVIake' the major ‘board’ a

fact: coordinate more closely

the advising systems of the dif-
ferent departments. ,-

-—“lncrease liason between the
departments and the CAS Ad-
vising Center.

-—“Increase departmental sup-
port for advisers. In most cases
this will mean only a course or
two or a few hours of a secre-
tary’s time.

the departmental

advising system. Increase its

consistency.“

This reported concluded with a
proposal that an assistant dean

_ be appointed whose sole responsi-
bility would be advising the lower,

and major boards. The principal
immediate job of the new dean
wouldbe to upgrade and unify ma-
jor advising and to improve rec-
ognition of the role of the‘ad_vi-
sors and advising. with a possi-
ble eventual take over of the post
of director of the Advising Center.

Concern Voiced on

by DREW PORVAZNIK

Members of Pius chapter of
the Students for a Democratic So-
ciety iSDSi are dissatisfied with
last week's University Senate
meeting during which raci_sm in
the college curriculum was dis-
cussed.

. / 
An article in the July. 1972. is-=

sue of American Psychologist, en-
titled "Behavior and Heredity."
precipitated the examination of
racism in the university. The arti-
cle called ‘for more scientific
study into the role that heredity
plays in human abilities andibe—
liavior. '

The SDS,felt the article pro-
moted racism under the guise of

-“scientific research.” This “re-

search” would attempt -to prove
the genetic inferiority of certain
groups of people; the findings
would then be published and
taught on the basis of academic
freedom, according to SDS rep-
resentatives. '

At the meeting. the SDS pre-
sented the article and reviewed
its implications. They challenged
the L'niversity to examine the role
and effects of .racism within
Pitt's curriculum.

ment at 1972 law aimed toward
providing educational service for
veterans.

George Sell. president of VAP.

I"  pagé 2—THE PITT NEWS—Friday, March 9, 1973
I ‘ by LARRY PANSINO

V The question of the intrinsic worth of individual lives versus the
— generalized quality of life as a species was discussed by an ethical
7 philosopher Tuesday afternoon at Magee Womens Hospital.
,\ Dr. Daniel Callahan, director of the Institute of Society. Ethics.
'.and the Life Sciences at Hastings—on-Hudson, N. Y.. related the lec-
ture topic to members of the medical profession. He assigned pri-
mary importance tothe sanctity and dignity of every human life and
 upon the individual’s right to preserve his own existence.

A debate arises from what Callahan termed “the mixed blessings

, g ‘ of medicine.” Because of the /advances of the health professions over
  the past few centuries, science has enabled man to keep more mem-
  bers of his species who otherwise would have died of natural causes

'5  alive, he continued. .

This situation has greatly increased the number of physically de-

, fected persons that reproduce and genetically pass their somewhat

’ - ., flawed physical conditions on to labor generations. The cumulative ef-
.j{—'j j ‘ fect, it has been argued, weakens the entire species and degenerates

’  the quality of life.
’ Callahan maintains that society and the medical_ profession have
noright to make decisions on who will live and who will die.

“Society cannot be left to determine the relative worth of individ-

_ ual lives. Central to the concept of quality of life should be to main-

, f _tain the ethic of the intrinsic worth of life. But we must go beyond to-
 day’s distribution of health care to make the ethic a reality,” he told
: I . V the audience of about 100 in the hospital's main auditorium.

_., ,=.—.-,. . "It is wrong for physicians to be forced into making choices among
' ‘V , patients all desparately needing use of treatment machines too scarce
”  A in number to accommodate every patient. ;

"Our inability to provide a decent medical care for all reflects on
g ,. the priorities of the federal government and its distribution of funds."
. g I Callahan explained.

. Callahan belives that the traditional ethic that all lives have worth
 l is related to the overall quality of life. “One of the ethic’s most radi-
 5. cal contributions is the connection it forms between worth inherent in
I g f individual lives and the quality of social life,” he claimed.
, A balance between the right to life and the quality of life was ad-
 _vocated by Callahan in order to best serve the welfare of the individual.
‘'-..Q/ \ As an example of his perspective on a hierarchy of priorities in
medicine, Callahan used the case of mongoloid births. “It is frequent-
; ' ly argued that mongolism- is a rather dread condition and that genetic
” screening for mongoloid fetuses is a desirable goal.

_ The three issues at stake here are the welfare of the potential
 - . inongoloid, the suffering (economic and psychological) of the family,
, ' ’ and the monetary cost to society. Each raises a very different set of
  ethical values. , _ I
, -.  "The critical issue is the welfare of th'e child. We ought not to de-
«‘  icide that a mongoloid child should not be born simply because of the as-
=‘“"'."',sumed suffering of the family. The worst grounds on whichto abort a
_ mongoloid fetus is the cost to society for caring for it;“ explained Calla-
 . _ 2 han. s g
_ When asked about the recent Supreme Court decision guarantee-
, ing the legality of a_bortions. Callahan, a Catholic father of five and au-
 '5 ;_ thor of Abortion: Law, Choice, and Morality, said he was glad of its
 availability but pointed out some aspects of the decision he thought
‘ I were regrettable.

 » "‘I wish the matter had been resolved in the legislatures rather
thari the Court,” he said. “Perhaps the lawmakers will eventually back
, ‘ the decision, since they are sensitive to shifts in public opinion.

Offering a way to beat the sys-
tem by working with it. Stanford
University Law School Profes-
sor Richard Danzig spoke Wed-
nesday on "Creation of a Comple-
mentary Decentralization of the
Criminal Justice System."

"People concerned with the
criminal justice system often find
they don‘t have the power to per-
suade the people within the sys-
tem. They should begin working
on alternatives within the system
instead. and concentrate on doing
things the existing system would
rather not do,“ said Danzig.

Danzig has authored a plan to
decentralize New York City’s
criminal justice system. The plan,
which is an example of what he
feels could be generally applied,
is keyed to the establishment of
neighborhood jurisdictions.

These jurisdictions would in-
clude community lawyers. inter-
‘ventlon units. community moods
and correctional facilities. All as-
pects of the system utilize com-
munity members as the sole exe-
cutors of the system. This would
serve as a screening method for
the courts. because problems
which could notbe solved with the
neighborhood would then go ‘into
the established court system.

"The courts are clogged with a
large number of cases which
shouldn‘t be there at all." Dan-
zig said. "These are situations in
which there should be no punish-
ment and no judgment_of guilt.
such as family disputes. Rather
they require mediation between
parties.

“When police are called in on a
family dispute, often the only pur-
pose they serve is that of a com-
mon enemy against whom the two
parties can unite. You want them
not to increase adversary feelings
but rather act as a conciliatory
agent.'But police have no agency
where they can refer this type of
case for mediation.”

The basis for the proposal is

the community. and Danzig sees
local legislation as an integral
part of the plan.

“If you have communities
which are in some manner natur-
ally divided (i.e. the Hill. Oak-
land). state legislation should per-
mit the local option system. By
this. the state would define a
crime and establish the penalties
for it. but the local area would
vote on the criminalization of
the act." Danzig applied this only
to victimless crimes.

“This would create a checker-
board effect. People could choose
their lifestyles according to laws
more readily. The U.S. permits
states to exercise options; I «just

want this done on a much smaller
level,” Danzig explained.

"If a community decided they
wanted to legalize or de—criminal-
ize prostitution. they would have
that option." Danzig continued.
"But the process works as a
whole. If they choose this. then
they. as a community, would have
to worry about the effect on the
rest of the system."

Fire Damages Three
Oakland Businesses

by KAREN BURGIO

A grease fire. originating in
the Pancake Kitchen on Forbes
Ave. caused $25,000 in damages to
that establishment and $50,000
damage to Leonard‘s Clothing
Store next door to the building
Wednesday night.

The Luv Inn. a bar on the sec-
ond story of the building. incurred
smoke damage.

Campus police officers Robert
Brodway and Tony Glowczewski
saw flames “like blow torches”
coming from the rear of the Pan-
cake Kitchen at 6:54 p.m. on Wed-
nesday. Leonard’s was closed,
and customers had left the Pan-
cake Kitchen but Officer Glow-
czewski proceeded upstairs to
evacuate the Luv In..

Only the manager of the Luv Inn
was still in the building. but Glow-
czewski with the aid of Pitts-
burgh Police Officer Dennis Byrd
checked the establishment for re-
maining persons. By that time.
smoke had filled the upstiars and
exit down the stairwell became
impossible.

Glowczewski said there were no
phones. windows. or lighted exit
signs in the second story of the
building. The two did find an un-
marked exit, but first had to re-
move boxes which blocked the
door. ’

Officer Brodway sensed that
the two had become trapped and
tried to find them upstairs, but
failed and returned before exit
became impossible. Officer Tarr

-of the Campus Police also at-

tempted to find the men with the

aid of an air pack but was over’

come ‘by smoke. He was treated
for smoke inhalation at Presby-
terian Hospital and released.

7 The fire was confined to the
downstairs portion of the building

‘ and fire equipment left the scene

at8:15 p.m.

Glowczewski and Brodway were
later treated and released for

Vet Benefit Enro/Imenf

By MITCH BERRY-

Veterans‘ Enrollment Week. the
time set aside for University Vet-
erans to enroll for benefits for the
Spring term and Spring and Sum-
mer sessions. will be held during
the’ week of March_ 19 through
the'23rd. at the Office of Veter-
an Affairs in 506 S.U.

According to Jack Hays. Dir-
ector of the Office of Veteran
Affairs. an attempt will be made

‘during the week "to give veter-
an‘s information on the benefits
to which he is entitled.’ and the
help he may need in solving any
past or current problems." _

Upon, enrolling for his bene-
fits, each veteran will receive an
information packet which will de-
tail procedures for getting aid,
tutorial services, work study em-
ployment, housing and insurance.

Secondly. each vet will be cer-
tified for his benefits with a new

‘ Veteran’s Information Card. which

will help reduce the number of

“Black/people" shouldn't talk
with whites about what they are
going to do— we should talk with
them about what we want," said
William Tiga Tita. Minority
Business Consultant and past-
advisor to the Intercultural _(IC)
House,
Blacks Up the Organization.

The seminar, which is a part

of any IC House sponsored ser-

ies called "Black-White Confron-.

tation" was also addressed by Dr.
- Kemathe, an economist presently
the Graduate
School of Business. and Riley
Davis. an employee of Western

Electric and member of the

Communications Workers ' of
America. ,
In his opening remarks Tita

dealt with the "environmental
conditions" that affect Black peo-
ple in this country and Africans];
He stressed that in economic
terms because of the forces of
European centered and American
Imperialism." the world is basic-
ally the same as_ it was twenty
years ago."

Tita went on to explain that
four different types of "environ-

at a seminar entitledi

ectly relating to the office. such as
changes in status. complaints
and overpayment and underpay-
ment of benefits. All problems
will be guaranteed to be solved
within five days. ’

Furthermore, Hays noted that
Enrollment Week is “the time
to get all problems settled, and the
time for the vet to get all of his

benefits.” He also added that, .

“we encourage the vets to deal
with our office exclusively "rather
than the Veterans’ Administration
Office.

"Ours is the only office able to
certify a man for his benefits.
and we are the only office where
the informational packet of writ-
ten material is available to the
vet." claimed Hays. I ‘

To better serve the veteran
during Enrollment Week. the Of-
fice of Veteran Affairs will ex-
tend its office hours from 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m. daily. No enrollments
will be accepted by phone or
by mail, however. and all veter-
ans are required to show a regis-
tered copy of the Course- Elec-
tion Record before enrolling.

mental conditions" are currently
operative: (1) the domination of
the world economy by the Unit-
ed States. the European Common
Market. the Soviet'Union. and
China; (2) the degree to which
the multi-national corporations
create dependency relations; (3)

‘ technology and scientific devel-

opment which are used as a
means of forcing negative conse-
quences on black and developing
nations; and (4) cultural frag-
mentation. which is a direct re-
sult of imperialism.

Tita summarized these four
factors in relationship to ‘white

institutions. saying "there is noth— r

ing in the institutions of the
white man that accepts -the fact
that Black men are human be-
ings." T
Riley Davis. the’/next speaker.
dealt with the “recent strike by
black workers at the Western Elec-

tric plant in the Point Breeze’

section of Pittsburgh. Davis. af-
ter briefly describing the work-
ers demands. stressed the need
for black "input in the descision
making process of the Union and
the company." ‘

Davis went on to explain that

Ferlo added. .

The coalition agreed at a meet-
ing Monday night to take a posi-
tion. as a group. opposing the fed-
eral regulations as they are pre-
sently enforced and to indicate
this opposition to appropriate per-
sons.

According to Liz Wolfskill, an-
other coordinator for the steering
committee, “This involves send-
ing telegrams and letters to HEW
(U.S. Department of Health, Ed-
ucation, and Welfare) to denounce
the decision, and send carbon
copies to area congressman so
they knowwe are opposing what
is being done.” - -

Ferlo said, “HEW put new
guidelines in the Federal Regis-
ter late last month, to be listed
therefor 30 days for comment.

the Union officials "promised that
the‘demands would have been
met if.the men came back to work.
and if they didn’t the company
would terminate our contracts."

I After the strike ended. however.

the Union did "absolutely noth-
ing to change the situation. so
now the black workers at West-
ern Electric are getting together
with black members of the Com-
munications Workers of America
from other cities. so they can
present a united front at the next
national Union meeting.“

The third panelist. Kem Kema-

the. maintained that “The black .

man in this system is obsolete —
but he doesn‘t have to be. so the
question becomes how to make
the system work for us."

In the discussion period that
followed. the panelists and the
audience dealt with such ques-

Taking The Plunge

Editor. The Pitt News:

I would like to thank Art Ros-
enberg for his article in Mon-
day, March 5th's issue of the
Pitt News concerning my let-
ter from the previous Pitt News.
I am happy to hear that there are
people who are concerned. have
tried to make the Pitt News a
better publication, and feel the
same way I do. I would like to
join the staff of the Pitt News
to help make a change as Art
suggests. I am a 2nd term senior
and may not be going’ to Pitt
after this term is over. so it
seems a bit late for me to help.
However. if I am accepted to
Pitt‘s graduate school which is
to "start in ,June, I will try to
join the Pitt News staff. if pos-
sible. and if I am accepted by the
staff. Then maybe I'll be able
to- help make the change. that

We Shoot Every Third

Mailman and the Second 6

  One Just Left

By MIKE MILLER
Editor

Replies to recent Pitt News editorials. complaining that the
University is selling the names of students to mailing list companies.
have disclosed that the real culprit is the company that publishes the
Student Directory. ‘

However. the University is sending out a barrage of letters.
mostly to seniors. seeminglytdesigned to instigate and epidemic oi
coronary thrombosis. ‘

The first such missive I received, came -at the beginning of the
term, informingame that I lacked the required number of credits for
graduation. This was quickly corrected when I informed the proper
authorities that I had attended the summer term. They took me at
my word.

I have since received a message from the Office of Alumni Af-
fairs informing me that I am a likely (emphasis theirs) candidate for
graduation. Included was an application requesting, among other
things. names of two persons who would always know my address
other than my parents so that I can continue to receive University
mail.

Sometimes I think that various University organizations have
formed a conspiracy against me. I‘ usually get information about the
student health and accident insurance program the day after the
list of crimes on campus arrives in the Pitt News office.

The most surprising piece -of correspondence I have, received
was a ’memo from the editor of the Pitt News informing me of a
staff meeting to elect a new editor. It_ was impressively typed on an
IBM machine in the proper form. \

At first I thought I had been deposed by a cleverly disguised
imposter, but later found out that the memo was from the Advisor
to Student Publications who had drafted it in accordance with the
Pitt News election code.’ The memo had been typed. late in the
day and sent out without my signature or knowledge. I received it
because I was on the list of staff members eligible to vote in the
election. V

I have received a request to vote for the ODK Man of the
Year by secret ballot. The ballot was to be returned “in an envel-
ope with my name on it. ’

In addition to University mail, I received a birthday card from
my life insurance agent, who was glad to see that I was still
around. * -

A gasoline company which claims that they “don't pass these
things around like smile buttons“ has sent me an application for a
credit card. Included in the "special offer“ is a replica of a contin-
ental dollar cast in pewter as a collector’s item.

Somehow, grade reports, transcripts, tuition’ refunds and invoic-
es always seem to come at the wrong time, to the wrong address, or
not to appear at all._ The University usually makes up for these
mistakes by sending me two invoices and then penalizing me
for which ever one I don’t pay.

‘The campus mail iseven worsefl constantly receive memos in-
forming me of an important meeting which will take place yesterday
and that my attendence is mandatory.

It's no wonder that college ‘students have the highest suicide

‘ rate of any group in the nation.

Marian Hurst, director of the
Office_ of Resident Life. explained
that the aim of University hous-
ing for next_ fall is "to develop
programs to meet the needs of-
many different life styles, thus
giving more opportunity for the
existance of these different life
styles."

_One of the major changes in the
new ‘policy is the increase in

‘housing available for male stu-

dents. There is a greater number
of single rooms available for men,
and they have also given the op-
portunity to live in suites.

Several different kinds of living"
learning programs have been es-

,here.

tablished. An intensive study area
has been established in Tower C,

floors eight, nine, 10 for males’

and 11, 12, 13 for" females. These
areas are designed to develop an

-environment in which the student

will be able to pursue his_aca'-
demic career. Quiet will be the
rule rather than -the exception

Students living in this area will
be.‘ "expected. to commit them-
selves to ‘the development of an
environment where they govern
themselves and ‘develop goals and

objectives to enhance their learn- ~

ing. A lounge will also be avail-
able for lectures, discussions-.
and studying with others.

Upon entering rooini 1522 in‘
Benedum Hall, custodian-x David

of Sanitation, Robert Grimpe.

The incident “appears to have
been a prank,” Detective Graham
of the Campus Police reported.

“The switch plate had been re-
movedsand bared live wires were
right next tothe switch,” Graham
said. “The custodian entered the
dark room, ‘and in throwing the
switch had his hand burned.” P

Graham said, “Although it
wasn’t as severe as we first thought.
it could have been very severe.

“What concernsius most is that
under slightly different circum-

"There have been other incidents I

involving switch plates being‘ re-

Superintendent Grimpe con-
curred with Graham in that there

by DEBBIE POPP

This week the Public .»\tlairs
Committee of the Student Atlairs
()l"t‘ice in conjunction with the var-
ous Chinese interest organiza-
tions within the l'niversity and the
l*’itt.sburgh community sponsored
a China limphasis Week to gen-
erate an awareness of the eight
million people formally acknow-
ledged by .\"ixon‘s 1972 trip to Chi-
na. The committee planned a
weeks activities featuring sam-
ples of the ctilture and heritage
of the Chinese nation to achieve
this goal.

The goal was achieved, at least
on Wednesday, at a luncheon held
in the Student Union Ballroom
where the West did meet the East.
While the hundred or so faculty
and students lunched on‘ chick-
en, rice, salomi, potato salad,
and apple pie, a procession of
models dressed in traditional Chi-
nese fashions walked upon~the
stage to the background music of
the Chinese tune “Ni Shan Yu Yi
Chiu.”

Among the styles presented in a
progression from the ancient to
the modern costumes of embroid-
ered pink silk, originally worn by
palace maidens as they performed
dances before royal audiences.
These costumes, composed of sev-
eral layers, can be reassembled
to produce a whole new outfit.

The fashion moderator noted the
pant suit was in "vogue" in the
East years before the West.

 
 

The vibrant reds. pinks. and
greens were impressive compar-
ed to the blue and olive .\lao LlIll-
lorms. The intricate embroidery
of flowers and hand made btit—
tons braided into the Chinese
character of longevity empha-
sized the creatiyity and patience
of the Chinese people.

The pride inherent in the Chi-
nese people, also, displayed itself
as Dr. James Liu who claims both
the United States and China as his
countries, spoke on the general
and academic conditions he ob-
served in China last year.

Dr. Liu who was introdttced by
Dr. William Dorrill. director ot
the Asian Studies Program.
taught at Pitt for ten years and
was a major innovator in estab-
lishing the East Asian Language

Center here. He made his trip to-

China in 1972 as the only social
sci__entist included in a team of 12
natural scientists.

Liu began his lecttire saying.
“China is the oldest living civil-
ization that failed to modernize.
Since 1940. it has tried to catch
up. But. China has its own back-
ground. characteristics. and way
of getting things done. If one tr -:
applying an American standard oi
modernization with preconceived
values then one is not acting in the
spirit of learning‘. China is.its own
model.

China learned a bitter lesson in

1960 when the Soviet Union with- _
‘drew all aid and technical assis-

tance, said Dr. Liu. Through hard
work the\Chinese have strived to
be self-reliant and have assumed
the policy of “no more big broth-
4" ‘"- said. Liu surmised, “Chi-

- me is hard but not so pain-
tul when equalized among the ma-
jority.

In evaluating their standard of
living. he said. "It is not an at-
fluent society but the basic needs-
of life are served for almost ev-
eryone. The Spartan life style
makes healthy people.“ I

He informed. Chinese medical
insurance at a token fee takes
care of everything from birth to
retirement. Modern and herbal

‘medicines are used simultaneous-

ly.

With improved health care and
its effects on population, the Chi-
government realized I the
problems of a predicted one hun-
dred million people by the year
two thousand. It has practiced
and . researched birth. control
methods including a “pill” effec-
tive for oneyear.

During his talk. Dr. Liu also dis-
cussed the demand of‘ consumer
goods and even manpower ex-
ceeding supply. the priority of
bicycles over cars. the decentral-
ization of industry and the poten-
tial resources of China.

Dr. Liu concluded his review 01
the general conditions of China by
saying. "The Revolution claimed
sacrifices. Some are known to us
personally. but we cannot let these
cloud the issue. Regardless of who

 succeeds Mao (who the mass me-V ’

dia has claimed died 93 times) no
one can change the new social-
economic order. It is massively
solid." '

In regardto the May 7 revolu-
tion, the Chinese conceded it

erupted in a zig zag manner and

caused property damage, Liu said. .

A postitive result was a sensitiv-
ity raising among the bureaucrats
and technicians who reorganized
in rural communities. Dr. Liu
claimed this as a social transfor-
mation that knocked down social
pressues.

In the closing portion of his talk.

_Dr. Liu accredited the academic

scene in China with modesty. an
eagerness to. learn. and a. “do—it-
y'ourself" attitude. He said. "The
Chinese are constantly asking for
suggestions and criticisms."
While most’Chinese colleges are
comparable to American techni-
cal schools. history courses and
significantly American history
since World War II and foreign
languages are beginning to play
major roles in their curriculum.-
The Chinese luncheon ended
with Dr. Liu commenting. "The
Chinese move toward academic
exchanges is slow because it takes
an affluent nation to devote time
and research for knowledge just
for knowledges sake.“ ‘

the loudest. We are sorry, sir, but-

your verbiage has clearly proven
one important thing: you never
were and perhaps never will be a
critic because you have not met
the basic criteria for criticism.

And what are these basic cri-
teria the reader may ask?‘/si Quite
simply and frankly, the require-
ments are twofold. A critic" must
have knowledge of the subject
matter and he must have taste.
The first of these is easily enough

procured but it is the second of-'

these which is not so quickly
found. As elitist as it may sound.
one is born with taste: one either
has itor one does not. i I

With these two requirements in
hand. the critic may go about his
business, making his contribu-
tion to the art of criticism. He
looks. listens, or reads and then

pronounces ‘his judgment. This "

and only this is the critics func-
tion—he must declare the merits
and the non-merits of an artistic
creation. If he cannot do this in

‘an equally knowledgable and ar-

tistic fashion, he is creating anti-
art and he defeats his very pur-
pose as a critic. '

Many of the complaints we have

B’nai I

recently received in regard to
our publication’s critics
from the pre-eternal accusation
of ignorance. An easy enough ac-
cusation to make but one which

is admittedly rather difficult to’.

prove. The cry of ignorance pro-
vides the perfect foundation for

V the charge of incorrect judgment.

No one has ever doubted that it is

stem A

/‘*1

far easier to be critical than to be .

correct. Indeed, we must feel safe
in assuming that there never was
a critic who was always correct.

Nonetheless, everyone plays the
of critic in varying degrees.
whether he be correct or not in
his criticism. The opportunity to
play “critics' critics," as display-
ed in the recent crop of letters
that have attempted to judge our

town policy of artistic criticism

certainly verifies this axiom.

Looking through these letters.
one very often senses an absence
of" knowledge and of taste in vary-
ing degrees. Despite this, letters
such _as these remind us of the
true raison d'etrev for criticismlin
the arts. If our critical standards
remain high, the resulting artistic

_ standards will at least attempt to
‘ ‘attain the same plane of achieve-,9»

ment.

This weekend the Pitt indoor track and field team
will be represented at the NCAA in Detroit. Michigan
by Bill Rea and the two mile rela_y team consisting
of Ken Silay. Rich Markley. Bob Steele and either
Rich Jackson. Chuck Mozingo or Tom Moore.

Rea. All-American and alternate to the 72 Olympics
will compete in his speciality the long jump. Rea who
took, first place in the IC4A‘s last weekend in Prince-
ton will come uppagainst the top long jumpers in the
U.S. Competition" will ‘include Olympic champion Ran-
dy Williams and outstanding long jumper Al Lanier. ‘

,Commenting on his competitor Randy Williams.
Rea stated. “I'm out to beat him. I have everything to
gain and he has everything to lose." _

This will be Rea’s third appearance at the NCAA
indoors. His freshman year he placed thirteenth and
last year he came in fifth.

Ranked ninth in the world in 1972 this tracksteit has
high hopes for the meet. _ '

"I hope to be either,first or second and if I'm not
I‘ll be disappointed," commented Rea. -

Last weekend the trackster was having trouble on
the runways due to poor health which made him weak.
He still has a head cold and a sore back. '

"Strengthwise my health may hurt me after four
or ‘five jumps.“ he said.

"I'm going to run like it's the last race I‘ll ever run." This

the affair will come off until late
Friday. The last time the two
squads met, Pitt squeaked out a
3-2 win in one of the most excit-
ing games in the team’s history. ' ‘

In the meantime, the skaters

are anxiously awaiting their re-

match with Duquesne. Pitt had to

.battle back‘ from a 4-0 deficit at

the end of.the first period to wind

- up on the better half of a 10-6

score when theylast faced the
Dukes.

That game featured several
rounds of fisticuffs and there
just might be a few hard feelings
left. Pitt Coach John Finney has
already indicated that Bart Mack
will start in goal against‘ Du-
quesne, while Mark Lieberman
will face Navy.

If the Navy game does go
through, it will be the first time
this season that Pitt will take part
in back to back contests. If any-
thing, Pitt has more to lose by

playing the Middies. The game’

against Duquesne will meanfirst
place of the City Division. If Pitt
can ‘win or tie on Sunday, they
will clinch the city title. ,

That night the Warriors, currently running second to the NBA

The Warriors are the club touted to be the one to unseat the Lak-

Three big reasons why the Warriors are stirring up trouble this
season are Rick Barry, Nate Thurmond and Cazzie Russell.

  Richards Raids Varsttyl

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

The dream of every junior’ varsity basketball
player is to get a crack at breaking into the var-
sity lineup. Few ever realize that dream in their
freshman year but the Panthers" Tom Richards is
one of that fortunate few.

' Richards. a 6-0. 160 pound freshman‘ guard.
rocketed to the varsity and saw action in 22 out of
the 26 games the Cats played this season.

,"I thought I‘d get a chance to play on the var-
sity squad but I didn't know when.“ related Rich-
gards. “When it did come I knew I had to make
the best of it. I just didnt think it would be that .

early but that's how it worked out."

Even though R-ichards was unexpectedly tapped
‘for the varsity, so early, the Pitt ‘eager did not feel
the effects of the transition. I .

"It wasn’t a big transition to go from the jay-
vee squad to the varsity." explained Richards.
"The real transition was in the beginning of prac-
tice —— it was a lot different. from playing high
school basketball. And besides I didn‘t play jay-
vee long enough to see ithe different though I
imagine there‘s a super difference." -

The Murrysville. Pa. native didghowever. find.
some difficulty in the shooting department dur-
ing the 72-73 campaign. ‘

In his senior year at Moon High School Rich-
ards averaged an outstanding 32.3 points per game ,
and collected a total of 1,574 points during his
entire high school career. In his first season_ with _
the Panthers, however, Richards was only able to
average 5.4 points per game. .

The young freshman star is disappointed with
his shooting performance this past seasonjln. addi-
tion to quarterbacking the team Richards would
like to be an effective shooting guard.

"I didn't thirik~’I shot as well as I should have or
as well as I wanted to." stated the Cat cager. "I
have to be a scoring threat as well as quarterba_ck.
I kno I can score and itadds to my ‘playing the’.
position. I know I can do better —— it's just up to
me to doit." , ' —

To do better is Richards’ obvious goalfor, next
season. “I have to .be a scoring threat—then the
defense won’t be able to sag on our other play-
ers like they did- this year. I also hope to be

able to learn to quarterback and run a team.”

portant than these specific goals is a winning sea;
son for the Panthers -next year.’ A repeat of the
past season is not what he is looking forward to. I

but I didn‘t take into consideration how y'oung‘.we_
were and needed to mature." remarked the cage"i'.._’
“It was disappointing -because I know we have
the talent to be a big winner. ‘  ’

guys, and next year I_ think we’ll be toughV,_too’,‘,’'f

' yard butterfly in 30.5 seconds. All

three swimmers had qualified for
Nationals earlier in the year.

The /200-yard freestyle relay
team also swam Friday. and set
a new team record with a 1:51.6
mark. That was good enough for
12th place in the consolation fin-
als, which secured team points for
Pitt. Members of the relay team
included team captain Ann Wall-

Price set a new teamrecord in
the 100-yard butterfly at 1210.0,

clothes. stereos. ra-  .
dios. and other 
things—at reduced ”
rates and the A110-
cation Committee
could care less. In
fact, the committee
has scorned Fryeer g
and accused him of .
misusing funds. cut-
ting off his minute
allocations.

The Road Racing - V  -
Team operates on a BOB FRYER
$100,000 annual budget. Gulf Oil Corporation pro-
vides Fryer’s organization with $40,000, and by
winning the Northeastern United States Sports
Car Championship last year and finishing third two
years ago, Fryer has managed to raise the rest of

 

 

1 his budget. It has not been easy, however.

What miffs Fryer though, is not the fact the Al-
locations Committee will not help him with his rac-
ing budget, but that they are preventing h_im from
making the Road Race team a Pitt organization.

 
   

Two years ago. the same committee allotted
Fryer $6.500, Fryer in turn spent close to $20.000

in transporting students to his races and ran up a

$1.700 phone bill in the process. Now the commit-
tee. noted for its spend-thrift. though Fryer was go-
ing to flick the bill on them. So. they cut him off.

i “We didn’t ask for a specific figure when they
gave us the $6,500,” notes Fryer. “But we accept-
ed it to pay for our campus expenses and for a stu-
dent office. They assumed that we were dumping
the big bill on their laps. Gulf Oil gave us the mon-
ey for that and all the students got was a free ride.
The accusation of mismanagement of funds was a
most untruthful one.”

The Pitt Road Racing Team is the only collegi-
ate road racing team in the country. The Alloca-
tion Committee had no precedent to deal with and
this, claims Fryer, hurt his operation.

"I feel that if the Allocation Committee could
have looked at another school's handling of a Road
Racing Team, they would have said ‘if its O.K.
there it its O.K. here.’ But, there aren‘t any other
teams.” the attractive Bridgeville native explained.

“They told us the University wanted nothing to
do with a Public Relations Organization. What in
the heck is the Pitt Hockey Club doing, when they
play? Aren’t they publicizing Pitt? In fact, aren’t
all the sports teams doing the same thing we were
turned away for?”

Because the team wins money. they can find no
soluce in the school’s athletic department. which
is governed‘ by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association. There aren’t too many other places for
Fryer to turn.

"If students knew what they had been deprived
of by the Allocation Committee.“ the 6-0 senior said.
“there would bea major revolt on campus. That was

a most irresponsible way possible for elected offi-’

cials to treat the student body.”
Gulf Oil gave Fryer a gas station in East Liber-

ty, where students could work for over $2 an hour.
The last two years has seen Pitt students earn
over $21,000 there. That no longer is available. Fry-
er had drawn up a catalog where any Pitt student
could purchase goods at a discount rate. That’s gone

too. He has landed jobs for a number of Pitt stu-  ix

dents with auto-researching firms, Gulf Oil and
Pepsi Cola Company in New York, because of their
participation in the Road Race Team. That might be
gone too. Why? Because Fryer is a little angry.

"By working on the car. procuring parts for the ’

car. publicity. and administrative work. our mem-
bers have accumulated over 16.000 ‘work hours
last year. and. ‘we have them all on punch cards.
That's higher than any other organization on cam-

pus. All we want is to be treated like WPGH and ’

the Pitt News, to name a few. All we want is the
$6,500 they gave us in the first place. 6

“Why should we bust our rear end and provide

all the benefits for the students. when the stu- 

dent elected officials don’t care about us one bit?" ’

Of course, Fryer has not given up hope.  :3,
Through the School of Engineering, he made credits I 
possible for fiiture members. He has captured the  f 
fancy of actor Paul Newman. He has been featured  7
in the New York Times, he has appeared on CBS ’ ”

television fora five minute spot, he has been shown

on ABS’s Wide World of Sports. All the time, as the.‘ it

PITT Road Racing Team.

Now he hopes to procure.-six parking spaces in f
d

the dormitory parking lot in order to bui a_garage

on campus to make it easier for the students to, 

come to his shop.

“I’m a senior and ‘before I leave I'd like to leave, 

the Road Racing Team as a campus organization."
he concluded.

Now isn‘t it about time that the Allocations’ it 
, Committee get off their “rear ends" and ehlp this 

man out‘?

The 190 pound division was
not full‘ of entrants, and the re-
sultant is that Berardi of Delta

by upsetting Sequian of Fiji,
who was top-seeded, doesn’t know
who his competition is, as Krugh
