affairs.

Haley said the appealwas based on three
grounds —— two being that the fraternity
thought the sanctions were too harsh and
that a difference between the fraternity and
the individual.should have been recog-
nized.

“The third part was that there was some
sense that the overall actions [from Pitt]
would produce an embarrassment to the
fraternity and its alumni,” Haley said.

Haley denied the fraternity’s appeal on
the grounds that “the sanctions were not

Regarding the third part of the appeal,
Haley said the university must be able to
sanction the fraternity at large when the
actions of its members warrant it.

The future of the fraternity house is now
in question. The brothers who lived there
were ordered to leave right before the holi-
day break, but, according to Haley, they

Solutions for mental illness

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

(Editor's note: This is the third of a three-part
series on depression.)

Though Rachel gives medication much of

the credit for her recovery from depression, .

she responded‘ with a vehement “no”p when
her counselor suggested she begin taking
Prozac. Even though her depression after her
husband's death had worsened, she was afraid
she would become addicted to the medica-
tion. .

She agreedto begin the medication at a low

dosage, with regular increases. She noticed a I

After the cloud of depression has lifted

By Kathleen Stanton
Senior Staff Writer

(Editor’s note: This is the third in a
three-part series of the author’s
personal experience with depres-
sion.)

I take my medication three times
every day. As I swallow each pill,
the memories remind me of where
I have come from. I know the pills
have played a part in my salvation,
but I don’t always welcome that
knowledge. Since the antidepres-
sant medication has built up in my
bloodstream, the painful memo-
ries, the routine disappointments,
have only a little power.

The meds have not made me
happy. Only I cany responsibility
for that But in the past month, my
attention has honed in on what
exactly has disappeared.
Something is lacking in my life.

That weight, that burden, that
sadness, those invisible tears.

They’re mostly gone, and for the
ﬁrst time in my 21 years, joy no
longer breaks through the pain
after much pounding and effort,
like the medieval townspeople try-
ing to storm the fortress doors.
Now, sometimes, a pleasant sensa-
tion simply wafts through my
waking moments, so lightly and
easily it feels like a dream.

And as I get to know my friends
better, as I meet new people, as I
spend time talking to my family, I
think; How could I have wanted to
give this up? How could I have
even thought about not reaching
this day? But of course, on that day
seven months ago, when I swal-
lowed anything I thought might
kill me, the depression had trans-
formed even the smallest of joys
into insurmountable blockades.

I ask why I must swallow pills
to maintain a balance in my days.
I’ve asked many doctors and oth-
ers in the mental health field to
give me answers. They tell me
they believe it’s an illness, but they

aren’t sure why the illness occurs.

1 They think it has a large biological

component. The fact that the med-
ication has helped me provides
some evidence of the chemical
imbalance they suspect

One day, Dr. Burrows knelt on ‘

the ﬂoor next to me, while I, lying
on the hospital bed, searched his
eyes, desperately seeking for the
answer to my question: “Why?” V

“I don’t know,” he said.

But he went on to tell me that his
best friend had killed himself when
he was 16 years old

“To this day, I haven’t gotten
over the fact thatif only he had
continued on his life’s journey, he
may have found some answers.” If
only

I saw the tragedy. A young per-
son giving up on what he has bare-
ly had time to experience, saying,
Forget it, life has nothing left to
oﬁer. And how many have felt this
way as a result of an illness that
has found treatment and hope, but
still no cure?

“Don’t give up on this experi-
ment we call life,” Dr. Burrows
said. “Stay alive to find the
answers.”

Now, seven months later. I have '

learned what story I was given
breath to tell, the one I’ve struggled
to live to tell: Depression is an ill-
ness, agonizing, painful and ugly.
But suffering from depression and
needing help has not exposed the
world to my weaknesses. Rather, it
has helped me to know my own
strength.

Ifl had never received help, if I
had continued in my misguided
conception that strength comes
from plodding through the mire of
depression and clenching my teeth
through the pain, if I had never
stretched beyond my comfort to
grasp the courage to ask for help, I
have no doubt my joumey would
have ended long before my 21st
birthday. I would never have
arrived where I stand today —— at
the edge of the -shadow of an
answer.

Depression

°From page 1
often connected with that is a con-
cern of becoming so dependent on
it that they would get hook .”

But some of those fears come
from widespread myths about
psychiatric medications. For one,
antidepressants aren’t addictive.
People who stop taking them
don’t experience withdrawal
symptoms.

Also, they don’t produce a
“high” in people who take them,
like harmful addictive drugs do.
They simply correct the chemical
imbalance and help patients to
climb back to a baseline in their
mood. Someone who doesn’t suf-
fer from depression won’t feel any
differently on antidepressants.

Dr. Kenneth Nash, who treats
students with Pitt’s Student Health
while maintaining a private prac-
tice, talks ‘with his patients about
their fears when making the deci-

The Pitt News, Thursday, January 11, 1996

sion about which medication to
prescribe. He says the fear of
addiction comes up, but college
students often worry more that

‘they’ll be on the medication for a

lifetime.

‘”That’s one of the myths: ‘I’m
gonna’ be on this for a lifetime,”’
Nash said. “A great deal of the
time, how long they’re on it is
limited to six months to a year.”

For someone going through a
first episode of depression, six
months may be long enough to
help the patient to work through
the depression. But anybody who
has suffered from more than
one episode may face a longer
period of time, possibly a few
years.

Some mental health profession-
als suggest that a patient who has
recurrent depression stay on the
medication for an indeﬁnite period
of time. With every episode of

of falling into another major
depression signiﬁcantly increase.

But most of the patients that
Nash sees at Student Health don’t
fall into the category of those with
a recurrent illness.

“The majority of people I see
are people who have never been
in treatment, never been on med-
ication. Or they’ve been to coun-
seling, had some psychotherapy,
but this is their first episode of
depression.”

For students, Nash said side
effects are another major concern.

“Some of the medications cause
some bluned vision or those kinds
of side effects that would interfere
with studying, so you have to be
careful with your side-effect pro-
file of the medication.”

Other possible side effects
include fatigue, nausea, tremors,
dizziness and constipation. In

most cases, the side effects go
away after a couple weeks on the
medication;

Many people who suffer from
depression join support groups to
help them in their recovery. One
group for depressed and manic

to friends and family members,
meets about twice a month on the
fourth ﬂoor of Westem'Psych.

One Wednesday night, about 20
people had come to the group. It
included young men and women
in their 20s, as well as the middle-
aged and older.

Depression had brought them

pulled them away from holiday

Thanksgiving.

Case of the missing media

Whitewater. It’s not just a place to go fishing and rafting.
It might possibly destroy a presidency for the second time in
the past 25 years. The latest development in the story is the
“smoking memo” from an aide to First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.

The mystery of the “smoking memo” has a lot of people '

up in arms, calling for further investigation into the Clintons
and their many (alleged) misdeeds. Vince Foster’s suicide,
Travelgate, Paula Jones, Tyson Chicken, Whitewater  the
list of allegations goes on for a mile or two down
Pennsylvania Avenue. ' »

But the case of the missing media is even more mysterious
than anything going on in the Clinton Whitehouse or in the
Whitewater affair. While any news reporter worth his or her
weight in salt is all over every word Newt Gingrich and Bob
Dole utter, the media don’t seem to remember that we have a
president, much less concern themselves with anything Bill
Clinton is doing (or is accused of doing). _

Of course, some of the more radical conspiracy theorists
might try to say that the Clintons are paying off the media,
threatening them or whatever else they need to do to get
favorable press. This is about as likely as an indoor rain-
storm. But it is obvious something is going on.

The problem is the overwhelming bias of the liberal
media. In 1972 practically every member of the media
jumped on the Republican president when the slightest hint
of impropriety found its way into the light. Impeach him!
Out with the crooked bastard! The hue and cry was raised in
every newspaper in the country.

Rob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were the leaders of the
journalism pack who feasted on President Nixon. But the
Woodwards and Bernsteins of the mainstream media world
have disappeared.

They have beenreplaced by people like Tom Brokaw and
Dan Rather, who are so bent on leftist politics their right
arms probably don’t work.

Journalists like Brokaw and Rather break a golden rule of
reporting —— don’t let your political opinions affect how you
report the news. But many media outlets have done just that,
as the Whitewater investigation is just beginning to become
front—page news.

Now President Clinton and his wife have been accused of
far more than Nixon ever thought of doing. Some say the
Clintons have had strange investment dealings while others
even link the Clintons to murder.’Nothing has been proven,
though, and if the accusations bear any truth whatsoever the
Clintons deserve fair hearings.

The most ironic twist to this story is that the media have
no apparent interest in anything the Clintons do unless it
involves discussing underwear preference ‘on MTV. It was
once said that even the appearance of impropriety was a dis-
grace to the presidency, and, until Clinton took office, the
media seemed to agree. So where have the media gone?
Maybe we’ll find out when the next Republican president
takes office.

Armchair QBs and rinkside seats

With both the Steelers and the
Penguins heading for the post-
season, now is a very good time
for me to tell you not to cheer at
Steelers games, and to cheer the
Penguins if they completely
screw up. Well, my editor did
tell me to make sure I grab the
reader’s attention as soon as
possible.

This really is what I am trying
to say, however. As a person
who has been into sports as
long as I can remember, I’m
tired of sports fans’ attitudes
that have been considered nor-
mal since long before I was
born. They give sports a bad
name, fans a worse one and,
most importantly, have
absolutely no justification.

Teams and their fans on the
surface seem to have a sort of
business relationship. They play
for us, and we pay them for it. It
works out nicely when every-
thing works and the team wins
the championship (except of
course in Montreal, where the
city celebrated their team’s
Stanley Cup victory with a riot
causing millions in damages).

When it doesn’t work out and
the team loses, we have prob-
lems. For blowing a World
Series game some years ago,
pitcher Mitch Williams received
death threats. I remember at the
time someone _on the net
describing this as “understand-
able.” Well then, I guess
Monica‘ Seles being stabbed to
please a Steffi Graf maniac and
Nancy Kerrigan getting clubbed
are also understandable.

It doesn’t even have to be a
question of whether our team
wins or loses. Fans have set up
their own long list of expecta-
tions. Tired of seeing them lose
Super Bowls, some commenta-
tors actually told the Bills to
“take a few years off,” or lose
for the sake of “true” sports
fans. Worse is the ordeal that
Hank Aaron went through when
he and his family received
numerous death threats for try-
ing to break a white man’s
(Babe Ruth’s) record. Then
there is the recent Giants game.

 

Robert
Chesnavich

At this game, 14 people were
arrested for starting a snowball
fight that left 15 injured and
nearly caused the NFL’s first
ever forfeit. Jeffrey Lange, who

was caught in the act, will plead-

innocent to the charge of
improper behavior, claiming he
was throwing at other fans and
not actually at the players.
Yeah, hitting someone’s kid in
the face with an iceball is deﬁ-
nitely proper behavior. And the
reason for this outburst? It’s the
Giants’ fault: they ran out of
beer.

I could keep going, but I
don’t‘ need to. Fans will always
come up with asinine stunts like
this without ever getting the
point. The point is this: the
game belongs to the players and
their direct affiliates, period. It
doesn’t belong to you, your city
or your fan club. This goes
against every theory of fandom,
but it is true.

Let’s reverse roles to look at
this. You’re playing chess in
some café. You’re about to
begin a game with someone,
and two people watching decide
to place bets. One guy offers
you $20 of his purse for you to
win. You accept and begin play-
ing. While you’re playing, the
two bettors begin talking aloud
about the moves. When you ask

them to be quiet, your fan ‘

responds, “Oh, stop being such
a whiny, overpaid baby.”

As the game goes on, you
begin losing, and your fan
begins to insult you for your
performance. You push through
the distractions and keep play-
ing. It begins to look bad, and

your fan, now pissed, starts
hurling cappuccinos at you. At
this point you quit the game, of
course enraging your “fan” fur-
ther, and you two are ready to
rumble. Don’t worry, you’re
safe. He’s thrown out of the
restaurant, complaining about
discrimination the entire time:
“Hey, everyone does this! Why
are you singling out me?”, one
of Lange’s justifications.

It’s really sad that we’ve for-
gotten the fact that the players
themselves already have
enough incentive to win: they
want to win for themselves.
Anyone who has competed in
anything on a reasonably large-
scale level knows this.,So it’s
more than just a question of
who owns the game. If you are
a fan of someone, that means
you should be interested in their
success for their sake. You

" should thus treat your idols as

your friends, whose success you
are also interested in. If some-
one you knew had a bad fate

befall them, would you throw _

iceballs at them to punish, or
would you just be there for
them instead? A true fan would
follow the actions of a true
friend. So if the Penguins fail
again to capture the Stanley
Cup this year, I expect everyone

» who would write hate mail to

write condolence mail, saying
you’ll root for them no less next
year.

And as for those Steeler
games, yes, if they ask you to
pipe down during the game so
that the teams can hear their sig-
nals, you must oblige. There is
no 12th man. Only 11 men are
are trying to play a game, if you
don’t mind. They’re happy to
have you, and you’re happy to
have them, but just remember if
the Steelers go all the way that
they are the ones who wear the
ring, not you. No matter how
many millions they make, it’s
still just a game. Their. game.

Georgetown is known as one of the
best defensive basketball schools in the
country. But last night, it was Pitt that
turned up the defense, handing the
fifth—ranked Hoyas a 75-56 defeat last
night before 12,080 at the Civic Arena.

“It feels good to beat a good ‘team
like Georgetown,” Pitt center Gerald
Jordan said. “We worked hard and we
prepared hard for this game.”

The loss was the Hoyas’ second of
the year, dropping them to 13-2 overall
and 3-1 in the Big East. They had a 10-
game winning-streak dating back to
their only previous loss on Nov. 24 in
the championship game of the presea-
son National Invitational Tournament.

Pitt’s win was its fourth in a row,
extending its season record to 7-3 and
2-1 in the conference. .

Pitt’s Jerry McCullough battles Georgetown’s Godwin Owinje for a lose ball.

McCu11ough’s four steals helped keep
the ball out of Iverson’s hands, which
were coming off a 40-point perfor-
mance last Saturday against Seton
Hall.

“We played as well as we could
tonight from a number of different
standpoints,” Pitt Coach Ralph Willard
said. “We’ve played good defense all
year, and we did that this game. They
never got in a rhythm.”

Georgetown broke out to an early 6-2
lead after a layup by Jerome Williams

I at the 17:09 mark." But the Hoyas only
increased their leadto seven, at 17-10,

after a Boubacar Aw jumper from the
right baseline. That was Georgetown’s

Lady Panther guard J oJ 0 Guzman
goes in for a layup in last night’s game.

The Pitt women’s basketball squad
pushed its losing streak to 10 games last
night, dropping a 57-54 decision to the
previously slumping St. John’s Red
Storm.

The loss at the Fitzgerald Filed House
marked the team’s fifth straight in the
Big East and dropped the its overall
record to 1-13.

Head coach Kirk Bruce, seeking his
first conference victory this season,
blamed the loss on the team’s free-throw
shooting, which went from a respectable
79 percent in the Big East to 11 for 28
last night.

“If we shoot our normal average from
the free-throw line, we win the game,”
Brucesaid. L

Pitt charity stripe trouble and poor
field-goal shooting from both teams kept
the game close until the end of the first
half, when St. John’s forward Kiana
Oliver scored six straight points to give
the Red Storm a 33-27 halftime edge.

The Lady Panthers answered early in
the second, with an underhanded lay-in
by Julie Fornadel and a JoJo Guzman
running one-hander to pull within one.
Guzman gave the Panthers their first lead
of the half with a three—pointer minutes
later. ‘

The Red Storm answered with a three‘-

biggest lead of the game.

Pitt then began its trapping defense,
which led to seven-straight Panther
points. Guard Kevin'Wi1lard knocked
down a 3-pointer from the right wing,
Mark Blount added two free throws
after being fouled by Othella
Harrington and a Georgetown turnover
after the inbound play led to a Garrick
Thomas layup and a tie score at 17.

The teams traded baskets until a
Thomas 3-pointer retied the game at
29-29 with 3:26 left in the half.’ In the
three-and-a-half minutes before inter-
mission, Thomas scored nine points, all
on threes. Those, added with three

Lady Panthers |ose again, making it l0 in a row

pointer by Yvonne Wilson and a layup by

center Keisha Bowman to take the lead at

47-43. Pitt closed the gap to 49-47, but
center Farrah Woods missed both free
throws on the next possession and failed
to tie the score.

Lady Panther Kellie Nelson converted
a three-point play to give the Panthers
their final lead of the game at 50-49.

Red Storm center Leila Crockett made

' two layups, and guard Nerille Miller

scored two of her team-leading 15 points
on foul shots to put the game out of
reach. ‘

The Lady Panthers could only answer
with three missed free throws by sopho-
more center Latia Howard, who went 5-
13 from the line for the evening.

In the closing seconds, both Gina
Montesano, who led all Pitt scorers with
13 points, and senior guard Stephanie
Petho committed turnovers to cement the
victory for St. John’s. The Red Storm
improved to 4-10 on the year with the
win. '

“We gave up so many opportunities on
the free-throw line,” said Bruce after the
game, stating that his slumping squad
had “found another way to lose a game.”

Asked about the team’s Saturday trip to
Villanova, the coach said, “I think we
can win the next game  but our players
have to feel that way, too. We’re more

than capable. This losing has consumed

us.

digest all of my previously pub-
Iished opinions on the
music/entertainment of ‘95 in a
handy condensed form. Not
only do I. fall for the sweet
siren-song of Nostalgia, I give
it to you to enjoy with misty
eyes and a handkerchief. Hell,
Manny did it in the In
Pittsburgh, so we’ve got to fol-
low suit.

If I were to summarize the
year with a lone term, it would
have to be “amnesia.” What
happened in 1995?
Somebody, please remind me.
In a broad sense, there were
few new or even exciting
developments in music. Indie
rock veterans took over the
Lollapalooza concert, and
attendance was low (especial-
ly during the brilliant Sonic
Youth set). Unfortunately, I
missed out — I had to work.
Sonic Youth actually released
their best album of the last
three years with Washing
Machine, but is this so impres-
sive? They’ve been consistent-
ly putting out good records for
the last 10 years. It seems that
‘95 was the same-old, same-
old year. Pavement, GBV,
Superchunk and Palace all put
out good records — surprise!‘ I
would be shocked and disap-
pointed it they didn’t. '

Merge Records, out of
Chapel Hill (run by Mac and
Laura of Superchunk), wins
the cool label of the year
award. Most of the music that I
actually listened to repeatedly
was from the label. Actually, its
new recruits impressed me
most of all. Two big thumbs up
for Guv’ner. Merge picked
them up from Ecstatic Peace!
and got them on the road.
They kicked ass in Pittsburgh
along with Superchunk, and,
best of all, the label released

 

another 7" to the package,
calling it Knight Moves. B|iss!!
Polvo just came out with
another recording —- a CD ep
entitled Eclipse. The sound is
evolved, more lucid, more
rock, but still is tripped out and
psychedelic in a decisive
Polvo way. Local indie rock
sensations Karl Hendricks Trio
put out their finest to date, A
Gesture of Kindness (Fiasco)
and got picked up by Merge. A
single was also released, and
an album is on the way. It's
about time!

Stephen Merritt, leader of
the,Magnetic Fields (Merge),
put together a project called
The 6ths. He wrote the music
and recruited a who’s who of
the indie rock vocal roster,
including Mark Robinson and
Lou Barlow. The album’s
called the Wasp Nest and was
released on a four-7" set on
London Records.‘

Blonde Redhead proved in
‘95 that they were not some
Sonic Youth knockoff with “La
Mia Vita Violenta." There’re
acoustic guitars, sitars and
some incredibly juicy vocals
that make for a great sound, a
Blonde Redhead sound.

Probably my favorite band of
1995 was The Sea and Cake.
This Chicago group features
some phenomenal musicians
from such illustrious bands as
Tortoise, Slint and the
Coctails. This group brings
soul, a much needed element,
into the indie forefront. They
groove with a mellow, spacey
swing. The Biz, their latest and
best on Thrill Jockey is a must-
have.

The year was pretty good for
Pittsburgh. Along with the
KHT, local acts Thee Speaking
Canaries and Don Cabellero
put out amazing records and

The revolution was tele-

vised. In the future, we’ll be
asking from geriatric homes,
“Where were you when the
verdict came down?” “What
was so great about Ricki
Lake?” and “Why was 1995
the year punk broke?”

Punk is the shit. But in ‘95
the so-called working class
looked more like a swank suit-
and-tie class; Greenday, CIV,
and the Offspring played the
part-with flashes of green hair;
snarls; and spikes, spikes,
spikes. The problem with them
—— punk shouldn’t be part of
the mainstream. It's like say-
ing, “l’m’punk, and I attend
CMU.” Although ever—present
on the air-waves, the bands
never made it to Perry Farel|’s
wet dream.

Lollapalooza, the “savior” of
alternative music, shook the
summer with acts such as
Pavement, Jesus Lizard, Sonic
Youth and their ubiquitous
Bi//board counterparts: Hole,
Beck and Elastica. Parents
patted their children on the
back from tents and warned
them “not to hurt _themselves in

’ the mosh pits.” When they

returned, parents offered wet-
naps to wipe their kids clean.
Elastica brought their new-
wave, Wire-ish sound to the
common household, where
people hopped and bopped to
“Connection" and “Stutter.”

January 1 1 1 99 D‘

and old b-boy schoolwear.
Sonic Youth ravaged as the
headliners of Lollapalooza,
showing their golden skills.

A fulfilled but unfulfilled gal,
Alanis Morrisette rode the
coat-tails of Liz Phair and PJ
Harvey as disgruntled womyn
of the ‘90s. Here's a message
to Alanis: Just because you
sound angry doesn't make us
forget you’re the Debbie
Gibson of Canada.

Speaking of Ms. “Shake
Your Love,” she emerged from
a hiatus into obscurity, show-
ing her style with a swan dive
into a mosh pit at a Circle
Jerks show. Seeing her mosh
is like coming home one day
and seeing your mother wear-
ing an X-Girl t-shirt: “Take it off
mom, please — it’s so embar-
rassing.”

Bush and Silverchair were
second-string Nirvanas. Dave
Grohl of the Foo Fighters real-
ized no one wants to be in the
shadow of the limelight forev-
er; even after Cobain’s death,
there’s still something to sal-
vage.

Locally, two alternative radio
stations, the Revolution and
the Edge emerged to ensure
that The Presidents of the
United States, Smashing
Pumpkins and Live were heard
12 times a day — every day.
The»Revo|ution even spon-
sored a few local shows such

Justine was the new pin-up _»wimams page 5

-willims from on 4-
as asis and uperchunk,

although for the latter show,
the Revolution was more
inclined to promote Seaweed
than the headliners. As Mac of
Superchunk kindly said, ‘‘It was
nice of them to sponsor the
show. It would be even better if
they played our records.”

Not only did music race to
exploit a genre of music; televi-
sion fancied a new day-time
look.

Ever since Ricki Lake’s talk
show became a priority for 12-
step wannabe’s, a well-orga-
nized effort has tried to steal
the day. Carnie (former singer
of Wilson-Phillips), Tempestt
(formerly a Cosby kid),
Gabrielle (formerly of “Beverly
Hills _90210”) and Danny (for-
merly of “The Partridge
Family”) all had shows that
went nowhere. Now they can
all be former talk show hosts;
more pink slips were given out
than at a lingerie sale at
Victoria’s Secret.

OJ Simpson's trial: enough
said.

Maggie Simpson showed Mr.
Burns that stealing candy from
a baby isn’t as easy as he
would think. The famous Mr.
and Mrs. Jackson interview
certified that Michael is white
and that Lisa-Marie can accu-
rately spit within five feet.

Even worse than you expect-
ed, MTV showed us the “real-
life” experience in London with
its autobiographical “Real
World lV.” “Singled Out”
topped off former Playmate of
the Year Jennie McCarthy, and
they combined Jack Kerouac’s

On The Road and “The Real
World” in a Generation-X visu-
al medium called “Road Rules”
(by the way, MTV doesn’t play
videos anymore). I was more
fascinated with VH1’s ‘80s
retro show, seeing Naked
Eyes, A-ha and Big Mountain
dance around with big hair-
cuts.

The ‘90s’ versions of detec-
tive noirs like “Murder One”
and “Homicide” are the new
generation of crime stories
that’ll make us look for reruns
of “Mike Hammer” and
“Dragnet.” ’

NBC’s “Must See TV” kept
me in most Thursday nights,
as “Friends” was a great open-
ing act to headliner “Seinfeld,”
which had a better latter sea-
son —— it was actually funny.
Who would have ever thought
George would be engaged or
Rachel and Ross wouldn't be
knockin’ boots? “The Single‘
Guy” isa productive filler,
because everyone is basically
too lazy to switch channels for
a half hour.

After the revolution was tele-
vised, people sat back with a
remote control and flipped
through 88 channels and saw
the reiteration of information. .
This was agreat year to be
couch potato, or even a mouse
potato (the computer version).

The year was uneventful.
Sorry Deadheads, Garcia was
more of a Ben and Jerry’s fla-
vor than a person; OJ’s trial
showed us that America is still
segregated; and still one out of
nine dentists preferred Trident
 when will that one ever give
up?

the Terrestrially Challenged
(Scat/Matador) is one of the
finest guitar rock albums, period.

On the flip side (it’s so easy to
complain), screw the corporate
rock whores who tried to re-instill
Beatle Mania. Maybe it was
George Harrison’s fault for all the
reunion “stuff” (massive debts 
ha-ha-hal). Regardless, “Free as
a Bird” sounds like bad ELO, and
the documentary skipped
through the band’s best work,
Revolver and Rubber Soul. The
coolest Beatle-related item was
certainly Yo La Tengo’s Tom
Courtenay video. Not only is it
one of the best pop songs of the
19903, the video is a beautiful
jab at the Beatle myth (and pre-
dated the hype onslaught by
months).

Interestingly enough, most _of ‘

my picks occured late in the
year. For quite some time, I was
only buying used records; noth-
ing new was doing it for me. A
few diamonds did surface
_amongst the rough and made the
year a pretty good one, though.
Most impressive was the local
scene and its national recogni-
ltion.

A Student's Guide to

Computing and In farma tian Services  

—
WEI.GOME!

 

If you’re new to the University or have yet to experience computing
here at Pitt, there’ s a lot to know about the services offered by
Computing and Information Services (CIS). We are the organization
responsible for providing the computing, information processing
and telecommunications services used by students, faculty and staff.

'%.

tudents — Attendinglla scttware workshop ...receiving advice from the Academic Computing 00

Even if you’ve never entered a single keystroke on a computer,
whether you know it or not, CIS touches your life every day. Our
Administrative Information Systems division designs, develops and
implements major administrative systems like ISIS, the Integrated
Student Information System. As a- student you use these -services
each time you register for a class, apply for student aid, visit your
academic advisor or search through the library’ s on-line catalog. Our
Telecommunications division is there for you each time you make a
telephone call from your dorm room.

But there’s much more. As a University of Pittsburgh student,
you have at your disposal a wide variety of computing equipment, the
latest software as well as access to the Internet, one of the fastest
growing sources of information on the planet. To unlock this
enormous potential, all you need to do is establish a computing
account and master a few computer basics.

FIRS T TIIINGS FIRST?
SETTING UP YGUB NE TWGITK
IIUTIIGITIZII TIGN AGGGUN T

Student computing at Pitt is funded by the Provost through
Universal Student Computing (USC)— a policy that provides
computer services to all students regardless of their academic
major. The first step in using the computing facilities is to set up a
Network Authorization Account. Here's how:

1- Bring your validated Pitt ID to any CIS computing lab.
(See the list of computing labs on page 4.)

2. Go to the lab consultant's desk and ask to receive a Network
Authorization Account.

3- The lab consultant will create your Network Authorization
Account, which consists of your initials, an st (student)
extension and possibly a number, for example, mrwstl .

4. The lab consultant will ask you to choose ‘a password for your
account and to type the password twice on the computer. For
security reasons, as you type your password, the characters
will not be displayed on the computer screen.

The consultant will give you a packet of information at the time
you create your Network Authorization Account. Your account
takes 24-48 hours to create; then you can begin using CIS
computing services. If you have any problems or questions about
your account, visit the CIS Accounts office at 110 Engineering
Hall or call 624-9343. V

GGMPU TING LABS

CIS maintainsseven publiccomputing labs on the Pittsburgh cam-
pus. The labs contain a mixture of DOS/Windows and Macintosh
personal computers along with high-end UNIX workstations. More
than 600 devices as well as advanced graphics facilities and numer-
ous laser printers are available on the Pittsburgh campus. The labs
are well-lit, air conditioned and set in quiet, academic surroundings.

All personal computers and workstations have connections to
PittNet, a campus-wide data network that gives you access to a rich
assortment of applications including word processing, database,
spreadsheet and statistical software. All machines also feature full
capability for searching, surfing or sending messages on the Internet.

Late Night Labs

During the week, facilities at the Sutherland Hall and Benedum
Hall labs are available 24 hours a day. These two labs offer more than
190 machines and six high—capacity laser printers to students for
those inevitable all—nighters.

TEC Lab

The Technology Evaluation and Consulting (TEC) Lab, located
in B-3 Engineering Hall, contains a wide range of high-tech services
including powerful imaging hardware and a wide assortment of
software for graphics manipulation, photo restoration, molecular
modeling and video digitizing. The TEC Lab is staffed by consult-
ants with the know—how to make the facilities work for you.

Hillman Library

CIS computing resources are available all throughout Hillman
Library including the lab in room 112 and the consulting ofﬁce at
G—7. The lab also offers a ﬁle recovery service for disks that may
have become damaged. The lab and all other labs with Macintosh
PCs feature DOS to Mac and Mac to DOS ﬁle conversion. In
addition, numerous personal computers are located outside of the lab
in carrels on every ﬂoor.

Consulting

All labs are staffed with knowledgeable user consultants and
a small library of instructional help sheets and manuals. The
consultants won't do your homework for you, but will help you
understand how to get the most use out of all available CIS facilities.
For in—depth consulting questions, there's also the Academic Com-
puting Consultant's office at G—7 Hillman Library, phone 624-9356.

Computing lab hours differ from lab to lab. At peak usage times,
such as the end of term, most computing labs offer extended hours.
Hours are posted in the labs, on-line or are available by calling
624-5061 for a recorded message. For more information about the
labs, see the map on page 4, or call David Schatz, Assistant to the
Director for Computing Labs, at 624-4721. V

HELP YDUHSELF

One of our goals at CIS is to assist you in becoming an
informed and self—reliant computer user.

- Each academic term, we offer an assortment of free
introductory software workshops for beginners and special-
ized classes for experienced users. Course schedules are
announced on—line and via brochures in the lab documen-
tation racks. For new users here at Pitt, CIS recommends
the following workshop titles: Overview of CIS/ULS
Resources, Getting Started in E-mail with Pine, Introduc-
tion to Internet Resource and Accessing PittNet from Home
using PPP. For more information on computing work-

shops, call 624-2977.

0 A series of "QuickStart" classes are conducted each week in
the computing labs. These one-hour workshops teach you
some basic computer skills needed for fundamental scho-
lastic tasks, such as word processing. Look for the QuickStart
course schedules posted on the computing lab doors.

- A wide selection of manuals, brochures and newsletters is
available in each computing lab. The labs are also stocked
with vendor manuals, reference guides and CIS publica-
tions. Ask the lab consultant for the manuals you need. A
wide range of CIS help sheets for specific tasks such as
electronic mail or word processing is also available in the
lab documentation racks and on—line.

- The Academic Computing consulting staff provides sup-
port to all University computing users, and is available to
answer calls or respond to walk—in inquiries from 9:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Call 624-9356 or

TIMESIIIIBING see was

CIS operates two publicly ac-
cessible timesharing services,
UNIX and VMS. Each sys-
tem offers a large assortment
of applications software, in-
cluding database management
systems, graphic display pro-
grams, mathematical and sta-
tistical programs, simulation
packages, text processing pro-
grams, file transfer facilities,
expert system development
packages and programming
languages. Both services of-
fer the ability to send and re-
ceive electronic mail to some-
one here on campus or around
the world via the Internet.

CIS’ UNIX service is pro-
vided by more than eight Sun
SPARC machines running the
Ultrix operating system and
using the Andrew File Sys-
tem (AFS).

University researchers
and scientists also have ac-
cess to the Pittsburgh Super-
computing Center's powerful
Cray Y-MP C90 supercom-
puter. The Cray can process
billions of calculations per
second and provides over one
billion bytes of memory.

As a member of the Univer-
sity community you can pur-
chase personal computers,
workstations, printers, soft-
ware and accessories at up to
50 percent off retail prices at
the Personal Computer Sup-
port and Service Center.

The PC Center sells Apple
Macintosh personal comput-
ers and DOS/Windows PCs
from Gateway, Dell and Ra-
dius as well as printers from
Apple and Hewlett Packard
and software from Microsoft,
Lotus and many more.

advice instead of a sales pitch.
PCs and peripherals are on
display at the Center so you
can evaluate the equipment
and see a demonstration be-
fore you buy.

A special "Truckload
Sale" generates considerable
interest each fall. For the past
five years, the PC Center has

Questions About Student Telephone Service (STS)

How much credit do Iha ve left?
This issue confuses many stu-
dents. Whenever you apply for
service, you send us a check for
$25. You are, in essence, paying
in advance for $25 worth of tele-

phone calls. When you have used
up that amount, we notify you
and give you 24 hours to pay for
an additional amount of service.

How do I use call waiting?

A single tone interruption during
a phone call indicates you have
anotheron-campus call. A double
tone interruption indicates an oﬁ‘-
campus call. To move from one
call to the other press the
switchhook and dial #8.

can I use my II T& T certificates
to pay my phone bill?
Yes.

Someone used my access code
to make calls. What should I
do?

You are responsible forALL calls
made using your personal au-
thorization code. For your own
protection, you should memorize
your number and do not reveal it
to anyone under any circum-
stances. If you suspect that some-
one has used your code without
yourauthorization, you can press
charges through the Student Ju-
dicial Board. Read your STS
manual or call the STS oﬂice for
more information.

(Ian I use my calling card to
make long-distance calls?

Yes you can, but you should be
aware that our rates may be
lower than your long—distance
carrier's.

What if I receive harassing
phone calls?

Notify the Campus Police
IMMEDIATELY at 624-2121.

Where do I pay my phone bill?

You can pay your telephone bill
at the STS Oﬂice, 6K0] Forbes
Quadrangle, from 8:30 a.m. to
3:00 p.m., Monday through F ri-
day. Or use the STS Payment
Drop Slot located outside the
McCormickHallAnnex (no cash,

please). We strongly urge you to
pay by check or money order
because the cancelled check or
moneyorderreceiptisyourproof
of payment. Make your check
payable to The University of
Pittsburgh and please include
your Social Security Number.

Ilow do I use voice mail?
Check out the Student's Guide
to Voice Mail brochure that you
received when you moved in.
Make sure that the address on
the front of the brochure corre-
sponds to your room location
since the rest of the numbers
listed are your personalized
voice mail access codes.

If you need help with voice mail,
call 39800.

 
OOURSE REOIS TRA TION MA OE EAS Y

Before you queue up to register for class  there's an easy way
to ﬁnd out via computer if a course is still open. A service
called ISISINFO provides up—to—the-minute information di-
rectly from the University's course and student databases.
ISISINFO allows you to see the course description, the number I
of open seats currently available in a given course section,
prerequisites and corequisites, as well as information about
alternate sections of the same course that may be available.
Best of all, you can search the database by keyword to quickly
target just the information you need. You could, for instance,
ask to see the open sections of all English Composition courses
offered on the Pittsburgh campus after 4:00 p.m.

You can connect to the ISISINFO service from any per-
sonal computer or workstation connected to PittNet or through I
the Internet. PCs and workstations running terminal emulation I
programs are available in the CIS computing labs. (Remem— I
ber, you must have a Network Authorization Account to use I
the lab equipment.) You mayalso dial in to ISISINFO via I
telephone using a PC, modem and communications software; I
the dial-up number is 621-5954.

Instructions for accessing ISISINFO are available in the
documentation racks in any CIS computing lab or ask the
computing lab consultants for assistance. For more informa-
tion about the ISISINFO service, contact the Academic
Computing Consultant, 624-9356. V

 
PRO TEO TINO YOUR OOMPUTER DA TA

Safe computing means protecting your important files from
harm. To do this, just follow a few common sense rules. Save
frequently. Always save your work to diskette or hard drive
at least once every 10 minutes. Back it up. Always make back-
up copies of important disks so that you'll have a working copy
in case of computer failure, accident or theft. Watch out for
viruses. Viruses can spread between infected disks if you
trade data and software or work on an infected machine. To
make sure you're not infected, check your disks frequently.
Each CIS computing lab has special virus detection worksta-
tions that can scan and disinfect your disks. Several free virus

protection software programs are also available to prevent,
_ _ _ _ _ - ... ...._....._,....-~.-..i.... .. i.-.,--.,.i, ,,._.~.  
detect and remove existing viruses. Just bring a ﬂoppy disk I 1“ Paper COPY Here 3 371st Of aV311ab1e

and copy the programs from the lab file servers. Use a surge
protector on your PC if you work at home. A surge protector I
is an inexpensive device that can be plugged into an ordinary I
wall socket to protect electronic equipment from power I
surges. A momentary voltage spike could ruin both your files I
and your computer. If worse comes to worse, and despite your I
best efforts, you find yourself stuck with a damaged disk — I
don't panic! CIS‘ Disk Repair service at the computing lab I
at 1 12 Hillman Library may be able to repair your damaged I
Macintosh or PC disk. For information, call 648-2328.
For more information about these topics, read the
helpsheet Helpful Hints for Taking Care of your Macintosh I
(or DOS) Floppy Disks, available in the campus computing I
labs, or call the PC Center at 624-1380. V

 
USE ll WORO PROCESSOR TO WRITE PAPERS

A computer is a great time-
saver, especially for writing
your research papers. It can
help you organize your
thoughts and quickly put them
on paper. Best of all, you can
easily revise and polish your
writing before printing. Most
word processors provide
spell—checking and thesaurus
features too, and allow you to
incorporate footnotes, end
notes, a table of contents and
graphics from other sources.

In the computing labs,
you can choose from several
popular word processors. If
you are a Macintosh user,
Microsoft Word and
MacWrite Pro are available;
DOS/Windows computer us-
ers can choose from
WordPerfect or Microsoft
Word.

to a ﬂying start by taking one I

of CIS‘ one-hour "Quick Start"
workshops held regularly in
the computing labs.

If you plan to save your
files, you should bring your
own ﬂoppy disks to the labs.
Disks can be purchased at the
PC Center for about $1.00
apiece. Ask for 3.5 inch
double-sided, double-density
disks since this format is us-
able in most labs. If you have
a personal computer at home
or in your dorm, you will prob-
ably want to use a format that
allows you to trade disks
between your personal com-
puter and those in the labs.

Although, the
index card catalogs on the ground ﬂoor of
Hillman Library can still be consulted when
necessary, going through them by hand
may not be the fastest or most efficient way
to conduct a search since:

0 Your search topic may not be in card form
yet, especially if it is very recent.

- If a topic is very speciﬁc, it may be hard to
find references using conventional sub-
ject headings; for example, education.

- If a topic is a combination of several
subject headings, it is time-consuming to
search by hand.

Currently, more than 2,000 databases are

available to the University of Pittsburgh

Libraries covering the humanities, ‘social

sciences and natural sciences, plus some

that provide statistical data. These data-
bases may or may not have theirequivalent

Using Your Own P0

If you wish to connect to
PittNet and the Internet with
your own PC from an apart-
mentor dorm room, make sure
that you have the following:

o A PC with a 386, 486 or
Pentium processor or a
Macintosh PC no older than
the Mac II variety.

0 8 to 16 megabytesof RAM

0 Windows 3.1 or Windows
95 for DOS PCs

o A Hayes-compatible modern
capable of at least 14,400
bps MNP5 communication

0 A properly conﬁgured
version of communication
software available from the
Consultant's ofﬁce at G-7
Hillman Library. For
Windows (3.1), ask for the
Trumpet Winsock package.
For Macintosh PCs, get
the MacPPP setup.



The Internet

PittNet is every student's
connection to the Internet, a
worldwide network of com-
puter networks. The Internet
is comprised of many
different types of machines
and millions of people all
using a set of common com-
munications protocols to send
messages, post information,
pass on data or just look
around to see what's out there.

You will discover an in-
credible wealth of informa-
tion on the Internet, ranging
from the scholarly to the
recreational. To whet your
appetite, here's a partial list of
things you can do on the
Internet:

0 Communicate with others
through electronic mail,
engage in real-time, on—line
discussions with other
Internet users, or subscribe
to a variety of discussion
groups.

- Browse through electronic
library catalogs.

0 Copy computer files or free
software from archives.

0 Use educational and
government informational
services.

0 Go "net surfing" for serious
research or just for fun
using the Intemet's most
popular service, the World
Wide Web.

A growing volume of
books, articles and guides
have been published by
Internet users. A copy of the
comprehensiveN0rthWestNet
Internet Resource Guide is

E-mail

Electronic mail (e-mail) is a
fast and economical way to
communicate with colleagues
and friends both at Pitt and
around the world. Any cur-
rently enrolled student with a
valid Network Authorization
Account can access e-mail
services, which are easily
accessible on both the UNIX
and VMS Timesharing Ser-
vices. CIS recommends
using Pine, a menu-based mail
utility available on the UNIX
Timesharing Service. With
Pine, even a novice user can
compose, edit (even spell
check!) and send messages
with ease. Complete instruc-
tions for using Pine can be
found in the document Get-
ting Started with Pine,
available on-line and in the
computing labs. V

Pittlnfo

CIS has developed an on-line
information service called
Pittlnfo. This service was
designed to serve the infor-
mation needs of those on
campus as well as those
visiting Pitt via the Internet.
Check out Pittlnfo for the lat-
est shuttle schedules, aca-
demic calendars and coming
events. This service also fea-
tures valuable policy infor-
mation and should be your
first stop to find information
about majors, graduate pro-
grams and financial aid.

To access Pittlnfo, log
onto either the UNIX or VMS
Timesharing Services and
enter "lynx" at the system
prompt. You can also access
Pittlnfo by using a PC-based
World Wide Web browsing
program and loading URL
www.pitt.edu. V

T
The World Wide Web

One of the fastest growing
services on the Internet is the
World Wide Web, a dynamic
application of sights, sounds
and information that makes
going all over the world and
gathering information as easy
as point and click. Pitt stu-
dents can access the Web in a
variety of different ways:

0 Using Netscape or Mosaic
software in the "Internet
Tools" folders on PCs in the
public computing labs. All
lab PCs feature a direct con-
nection to the Internet so
tapping into the Web only
requires a few keystrokes.

- Using Netscape or Mosaic
from home or a dorm room
with a SLIP/PPP connec-
tion using a modem. High-
speed dial—up lines are ac-
cessible to Pitt students and
free software and instruc-
tions are available to help
set up your connection.

0 Using the "lynx" command
while logged onto UNIX or
VMS. While Lynx can't
translate sounds and graph-
ics, it provides an easy way
to tap into the resources on
the Web using a slower
modem and older dialup
software.

In addition, CIS offers a num-
ber of introductory comput-
ing workshops that cover how
to use "The Web" for research
and also how to create your
own unique "home page" for
anyone in the world to see.
For information on these and
other workshops, check out
