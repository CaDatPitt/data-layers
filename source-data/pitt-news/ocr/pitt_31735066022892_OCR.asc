More than 500, journals total-

available monies allotted them.

Almost 300 of the cancellations

Long anticipated Student
Union renovations are to begin this
summer with completion expected
in 18-20 months, according to Jack
Freeman, senior vice chancellor for
administration.

Freeman said at a press con-
ference yesterday that a “realistic
program to serve long term need”

. has been developed for the former

Schenley Hotel, now a student
-union for Pitt. ' .

Architectural programs were
then unveiled which include exten-
sive renovation of the basement and
main floors. . I

A student cafe, a recreation
room, a snack bar and dining area,
and the lower level of a skylit
atrium are planned for the base-
ment, according to John Dencler, a
member of Williams, Trebilcock,
Whitehead Architects and Plan-
ners, Inc., firm that designed the
renovations.

Dencler said a multi-purpose
room and new entrances are includ-
ed in the main ﬂoor renovations.

“The multi-purpose room will
be located where the recreation
room is now,” Dencler said.

A light and sound system, a
projection booth, and sound equip-
ment will be added to the room, ac-
cording to Dencler.

- “The room can be divided and
two programs can run simultan-
eously,” Dencler said. —

The additional entrances in-
cluded in the plans will create “less

not yet been finalized,‘ Freeman
said. He explained that the renova-
tions will begin on the top floor.

“We plan to construct two I

floors at a time,” Freeman said.

“The construction, of the two main

floors will be the last item. ‘
“The two main floors will be

used to house displace groups,” ex-‘  ' ’

plained Freeman. He added that he i
_expected the renovations to cause

“some inconvenience” ‘to the ‘

various groups. .
The math department will be
housed on floors eight, nine and 10,
and these floors will not be exten-
sively renovated, according to
Freeman. .- 4

“The rest of the floors will-be
entirely gutted and renovated,” he
said. Freeman added that the pre-
sent floor designs were “highly in—‘
efficient.” '

Instead of extensively
renovating, why not construct a
new building?

“In the first place, the building
is sound, and it’s in a good location
in the heart of the campus,”
Freeman replied, “the building also
has an historical value.”

Renovating will be half the cost
of constructing a new building,
Freeman added.

The projected cost of the
renovations is between $10 and $11
million. According to Freeman, a
student fee will be charged to help
pay for the project.

However, Freeman said no
students will be charged until after
He
estimated a payback time of 30-40
years. "

to Dr. Maurice Sussman, chairman
of the department.

Sussman said his department
had to cut back 12 to 15 percent,
reducing the total number of jour-
nals in his department to 313. He
claimed his department has the

sity, yet it is being penalized severe-

1967 a “grandiose plan” was
developed for the student union,
based on large enrollment projec-
tions and the belief the state would
fund the project.
However, Freeman said enroll-

receded, so the plans had to be

Pitt's Study Abroad 0

By GLENN FREUND

. Pitt News Staff Writer

“Travel is fatal to prejudice,
bigotry and narrow rnindedness,”
Mark Twain once said. For students
wishing to. broaden their minds
while extending their education
overseas, the Study Abroad Office,
newly located at 928 Cathedral of
Learning, offers numerous foreign

' study programs on all continents of

the globe, as well as on the high
seas.

The office moved from Mervis
Hall, where it was under the office
of international student services,
and it opened in August with a full-

time Study Abroad adviser, Kathy
Miller, who said the program had
its ups and down financially in the
past but is now on a steady course.

“The budget was enthusiastically
received this year,” said Miller.
This enabled the program to expand
into a separate office under the
auspices of the Dean’s office. She
said students now have better access
to the program because the office is
located near the CAS advising
center and most students in the pro-
gram are traditionally CAS
undergraduates.

“The university prides itself as an
international community; unfor-

tunately it doesn’t work the other

V way around, though the university
‘ tries to do so through Study

Abroad,” said Miller.

Miller, who herself has been in-
volved in four independent research
foreign study programs in Western
Europe, said she is excited about

' the program. She saidvone of her

main roles is to “find out as much
as possible about programs Pitt of-
fers for study abroad from various
departments and administrative
units, and match this with univer-
sities overseas to aid the educational
experience” of students in the pro‘-
gram. She is also in the process of

  Urban Studies Director Says City  
Was Prepared for Population Dip  

I By PEGGY FERRI

Robin Jones, coordinator of
Pitt's urban studies program for
three years, does not believe the
problem of Pittsburgh’s recent
decline in urban population to be
severe.

“A decline has been going on for
some time now,” explained Jones,

“and Pittsburgh knows what it's,

like to pay the high taxes and costs
that exist because of a migration to
the suburbs.

“Therepis decline not only from
here to the suburbs, but from here
to other cities as well. This can be
connected with the national growth,

Something better than speed reading?-

sion, memory, listening, and concentration skills) in two days. Also includ-
_ed are tips on how to develop a photographic memory.

which now is not as dependent on
manufacturing. ’ ’

Pittsburgh,_ fortunately, has
adapted to a change in industries,
according to Jones. A program
called Renaissance developed the
Point and Gateway Center to

accommodate the switch from a

production to corporate head-
quarters. - -

“Other cities,” said Jones, “did
not foresee such a switch within
them and are far worse off than
Pittsburgh. ’ ’ '

“Size,” added Jones, “isn’t as
important to me as the concentra-
tions of people there. Optimists say
that these people, mostly poor, will
learn new skills and work with the
transition from a production to a
corporate center. I’m not sure if I
agree, but it doesn’t make me feel
better to hear that things will be
O.K. in 20 years.”

Jones commented that declineiin
urban population does not
necessarily point to a decrease in
federal aid.

“Aid is distributed by many for-
mulas,” said Jones, “but not
always on the basis of population.”
It is the idea of some to tax subur-
banites coming into Pittsburgh, she

said, adding that those who make
their money in the city should have
some sort of obligation to pay.

Though the problems in Pitts-
burgh 'aren’t serious when com-
pared " with those nationwide, the
solutions to them will probably not
come easily or rapidly.

“There is no one solution,”
stated Jones. “All causes for the
problems are very interrelated. For
instance, after World War II, the
government subsidized mortgages.

' But the middle class built homes in

the suburbs, thus defeating its pur-
pose.”

There is no well-defined reason
why peopleleave the city for the

suburbs; Jones suggested it is a v -

sort of adventurous spirit that
makes moving out of the city to a
space of one’s own the preference.
But whatever the reason, the fact
remains that the cities have lost
many of their citizens.

“The problems we do have,

is to orient students to the program
and place them in a suitable pro-

Some of the many Study Abroad
programs available include Latin
American ' Studies, East Asian *
Languages and Literatures (which
involves a tem in Japan), and the
“newest and flashiest” set-up called
“Semester at Sea.” The Semester
Sea program involves spending a
term on an oceanliner that takes a
Magellan-like -route around the

both on board and in port. It carries
500 students from various univer-
sities and has a faculty payload of

nes, France, Seville and Cadiz,
Spain, and Leningrad. The Institute
of European Studies in London,
Paris, Nantes, Friedberg, Madrid,
Vienna, and Durham (England) of-
fers a liberal arts curriculum. Miller
said there are programs “for every
country we are allowed into.”

Miller said scholarships for study
abroad programs are very limited;
however, grants and loans such as
PHEAA and other financial aid ap-
ply equally.

Students going overseas, said
Miller, will find a lower standard of
living, fewer conveniences and dif-
ferent values, but said that, in her
experience, “Students return with
more maturity, broadness of mind,
a greater desire to learn, and find a

different way of looking at things.” '

Study Abroad is mainly geared to
undergraduates, said Miller, but it
is expanding to include more
graduate offerings.

(PMAP).
The group is directed by Howard
Natter, a student, and advised by

The purpose of PMAP is to-

Natter. Currently the group is
striving for full-time status in
cooperation with dormitory resi-

January, at which time he feels that
he will have the necessary

ARude Awakening for Freshmen: 0

By VALERIE JACHIMOWICZ

One of the biggest problems
faced by male freshman is doing
their own laundry for the ﬁrst time.

The greatest trouble area is the

washing machine. A question many
freshmen have is how to sort out
different color clothes. On a visit to
the Towers’ laundry.Sunday, one
freshman was seen washing his
favorite white shirt with a pair of
red shorts, and was distressed
when he discovered that the shirt
had turned pink.
. Other students apparently were
having similar problems. Some of
their comments included: “I can’t
understand what I’m doing ,” “I’m
a mess,”_and “I don’t know what
the hell’s going on!”

Once the clothes are in the .

machine, the next hurdle to
overcome is how much laundry
detergent to add. A standard
practice is to keep pouring until it
looks as if enough soap is in the

Studlnts Run Medical Aid Program

new members in a sixto eight
week course, meeting twice a week
fortwo hours a night, according to
Natter. ’

For the general student popula-
tion, the group will sponsor a
four--hour course in CPR in
October. In,1979, over 900 people
received some kind of instruction
from the group, Natter said.

PMAP is equipped to handle any
energency ranging from frostbite
and broken legs to drug-alcohol
reactions. Natter said the group
was ﬁrst on the scene to treat
injuries after the Langley Hal]
explosion in 1977.

Natter said his main problem
now is getting funding from the
Student Health Advisory Board for
equipment and training ﬁlms. The
group currently has two “jump
kits” containing splints, bandages,
icepacks, and other ﬁrst aid-
equipment. ‘

    

machine. One freshman seemed.
. concerned about possible errors.

“What happens if you add too
much soap?” he asked.

After figuring out how much
soap to use, the rest of the
clothes-washing process appeared
to go relatively smoothly. Some
freshmen, however had problems
with the functioning of the
machines. .

‘For instance, onelmale freshman
panicked when he started the
machine and there was. no water
coming in.‘ He was greatly relieved
when it was explained by another
student that the lid has to be closed
before the washer starts to ﬁll up.

One concern to some first-time
users of the laundry is what
happens when the machine enters
the spin cycle. When questioned
about his reaction to the vibrations
of the washing machine, one

  NoOne To Dothe Weekly Laundry

freshman commented, “The vi-
brating washers are frightening. (I
wonder) what’s happening to the
clothes.” Upon opening the ma-
chine after the ﬁnal spin, the same
freshman was alarmed at the

.4 -results of the spinning. His cries of
“It’s stuck to the sides!‘ I‘ can’t
believe this!” echoed through the
laundry room.

Having gone safely through
clothes-washing, drying the clothes
presents few problem. One stu-
dent, however, was fearful that his
clothing would shrink. Also, one
freshman called himself a “fresh-
man in dest_ress”— he said he was
“ripped-off by the _,same dryer
twice.” .

A laundry room veteran, when
questioned about what he thought
of the problems encountered by
freshmen, concluded that the best
solution is to “get your girlfriend
to do your laundry.”

KDKA: Daily Number  
  Tampering Possible

By The Associated Press

Richard Papiernick, a spokesman

PITTSBURGH—The1‘e may haV€ -for the Department of Revenue,

been time to tamper with the
machines used to pick Pennsylvan-
ia’s daily lottery number on April
24, the day the numbers game
allegedly was fixed, according to a
report by KDKA-TV;

The Pittsburgh station, which
broadcasted the report Wednesday

. and Thursday, said it interviewed

dozens of people involved with the
Daily Number, including senior
citizens who take part in the
drawing.‘

“From what they told us, there
was plenty of time to ﬁx the
number. Security, to put it mildly,
was sloppy,” reporter Charles
Bosworth, of the station's investi-
gative team. said Thursday.

KDKA report because a grand jury
is investigating the allegations of a

Ofﬁcials of WTAE-TV in Pitts-
burgh, where the: nightly drawing
is held, were unavailable for
comment.

The game has been under a
cloud of suspicion -since early May,
when allegations were made that
the April 24 number -666- was

of $3.8 million. .

The charges were first made by a

Opinion

    Another cutback

Programs come and programs go. ._ .but these
days at Pitt, programs seem to be coming and going
with increasing frequency. '

This past summer Cynthia Vanda, director of
the University Women’s Center, received notification
that the center’s $47,000 per year budget would be
"erased from the university rolls after June 30, 1981.

“We had to look at the units on campus that are
most central to the university’s mission,” said,Assis-
tant Provost Ray Steele, explaining the cut. “The
Women’s Center is a special place (in the university
community), but if I have to make a choice (to cut a
program), the Women’s Center is peripheral to’ our
central mission.

Steele added that the W omen’s Center was not _
“singled out” as a program that had to go due to in-.

sufficient state funding. but was instead a necessary
cut in Pitt’s self-evaluation of its‘ “total mission.”

“We are a low priority in their (the administra-
tion’s) minds,” Vanda said. Vanda said she believes
this low priority had more to do with the elimination
of the program than any type of funding shortage.

But Vanda arid the future of the Women’s
Center were not left without an alternative to their
dilemma. Steele told Vanda that she and her staff
can halt the closing of the center by undertaking a
fund raising campaign with all proceeds going to the
center’s preservation.

Hard times have certainly hit the university
when program directors are forced to solicit dona-
tions just so they may keep their job. What could
possibly be ahead in the university’s never ending
battle against inflation? Could it be that maybe
someday Chancellor Wesley Posvar, along ‘with his
senior staff, may have to hit the street of Oakland
collecting nickels and dimes to pay their salaries?

At the present time, such a possibility seems
ludicrous but with the money becoming tighter each
year, it comes nearer to reality with each passing day.

The proverbial shrinking dollar, or rather the
lack of it, on the Pitt campus has caused students to
stand in line waiting and hoping to get special permis-
sion to enter the dwindling number of class sections,

iﬁlrzhlﬂitt News’

Page 8——Wednesday, September 10, 1980

sections that are dwindling because the university
cannot afford to employ more teachers and open
more sections. '

This, of course, follows a rather hefty tuition in-
crease that greeted students this term and the
possibility of yet another increase next term.

Cynthia Vanda is not alone in her predicament.

Special programs across the university are suf-,
fering as a result of money shortages.

There is no one to blame. It’s not the ad-
ministration’s fault. It is only making do with the
resources available at this time.

Inflation has had a tremendous impact, not only
on the university but the entire nation, with
steelworkers out of jobs and out of unemployment
benefits, and autoworkers furloughed for indefinite
periods of time."

Of course, there are no easy solutions that we
here at The Pitt News can offer. _
_ We can only say that at this time, when all odds
are against the university and its students, we must
pull together to make the best of a bad situation and
hope that just maybe, better days are ahead. ._

Vanda thought differently of the cut.

Carter Decision to Fargo Three-Way Debate ‘inexcusable’

By LARRY LUNSFORD

President Carter’s refusal to par-
ticipate in the upcoming debates
sponsored by the League of Women
Voters‘ (LWV) comes as somewhat
of a surprise considering the re-
bound he has made in the polls
since the conclusion of the
Democratic Convention last August
in New York. This week’s national
election poll which appeared in
Time Magazine showed the presi-
dent with the same precentage
points, 39, as Ronald Reagan. John
Anderson had 15 percent. , —

The early reaction to'Carter’s
refusal expectedly has been negative
from the Republican challenger and
his party members, as well as
Anderson and his backers, but reac-
tions from the Democratic sector
have also been against the pres-
ident’s decision.

Jimmy Carter has decided not to ‘

participate in the first LWV debate
scheduled for Sept. 21, in Baltimore
because the debate will include the
independent Anderson. Carter has
insisted that he will not participate
in a three-way debate, claiming that
he will only debate certiﬁed can-
didates who stand a chance to win
the election.

Learning that Carter would not
participate, LWV officials and
representatives from the Anderson
and Reagan camps met with Carter
campaign officials for two-and-a-
half hours in an attempt to reach an
agreement. which all parties would

 3.-:. xi‘ :2 5 g:»_=__%;=,:»_,-;.$:.s~_ as _<_

accept. It was suggested that there
be one-on-one debates whereby
Carter would debate Reagan alone
and debate‘ Anderson alone, and
then Anderson would debate
Reagan alone. The Carter people
refused this offer. It was then sug-
gested that the three-way-debate go

on’ as scheduled Sept. 21, and then’

Carter and Reagan debate alone,
and again the Carter folks refused.

It is evident that the President
will only play ball if it is his ball on
his court with his own rules. The

refusal to participate in the debates
is a pure admission by the Carter
camp that they are afraid of the
Anderson campaign. All along, the
Carter campaign has insisted that
they will win re-election this
November. If they are so confident
of victory, then why the refusal to
debate Anderson?

Even if we could understand why
he won’t go with the three-man
debate later this month, it definitely
is difficult to comprehend why the
president and his officials turned

down the compromises that were at-
tempted. Carter’s decision is inex-
cusable.

Only the outcome of the upcom-
ing debate that now will only
feature Anderson and Reagan--and
an empty chair--will tell which man
and which party will benefit from
the president’s actions. Anderson
and Reagan could throw enough
dirt at each other to aid Carter’s
campaign, or one of the two could
come out looking better than the
other, as well as better than Carter.

Analyzing the Debate Controversy

By WALTER R. WATSON

President Carter’s campaign chair-
man, Bob Strauss, announced last
Tuesday‘ that Mr. Carter will not
take part in the first of the League
of Women Voters (LWV) Presiden-
tial Debates, scheduled for Sept. 21,
in Baltimore. The president declin-
ed because the independent
presidential candidate, - John B.
Anderson, has qualified for the
debate and accepted the League’s
invitation. This is in direct opposi-
tion to Carter’s stand to join the
debates provided that only he and
Republican hopeful Ronald Reagan
slug it out in the first debate.
Foregoing the pressure of not hav-
ing the encumbent at their debate,
the LWV has courageously chosen
to run the first debate with or

' without Carter, and with or without

televised coverage.‘ _'  ’ ‘-

  

.»‘'-‘*..x'a:‘4‘~ “'1  ~-‘ '- 

The plan, created by the Carter
re-election experts, is that the Pres-
ident will suffer less damage in his
second-term attempt by staying
away from the cameras and mikes
with Reagan and Anderson. The

- New York Times reported Wednes-

day that Carter considered~Ander-
son “a significant factor,” and that
the Anderson candidacy is
f‘primarily a creation of the press.”
Of course, the attention given to
most challengers to the incumbent
is perhaps as broad and as
voluminous as the amount of ex-
posure a president gets sitting in his
rose garden, or shaking hands of
well-wishers in Tuscumbia.

No doubt, the Illinois Con-
gressman is a thorn in the Pres-
ident’s side, a monkey wrench in his
‘get-re-elected-quick’ machinery.

The exposure John Anderson is get- ,
‘ ting from‘the"press“:,isd perhapsoncv ,

of the only things that makes this
election year worth covering.
Anderson may be the spark to send
more than the 54 percent" of eligible
voters of 1976 to at least cast their
protest vote against Carter. ‘His
position as an independent is a uni-
que one demanding our considera-
tion, because this ‘‘little guy,” with
barely enough campaign funds to
be more than a protesters vote, is
bucking Republicans and
Democrats alike.

Mr. Carter may feel a ‘crisis of
confidence’ in himself coming on,
as memories of former President
Gerald Ford bumbling in the first
1976 LWV Presidential Debates
may just be surfacing nearly four
years after they took place. Because
Anderson‘ is the new kid on the
block, more people watching a
three-way confrontation will listen

News.) , 

Many political analysts are saying
this election offers the worst can-
didates in presidential election
history and that most voters are not
going to be voting for a particular
man but voting against another can-
didate. Such a statement, if true, is
sad and rediculous considering that
we are talking about what is sup-
posedly the most powerful position
in the world. These debates are the
last opportunity for those many
voters who have yet to decide on a
candidate to hear the three men
discuss and debate the issues and
the records face-to-face. The persis-

tent exchange of rhetoric in the
newscasts and through the print
media is not enough. There’s
nothing like doing it is person.

Even if it is true that Anderson
might not be able to win the election
outright, enough voters in the coun-
try have indicated support for
Anderson along the line that in the
interest of democracy, he deserves a
position on the ballot and in the
debates. He met the League’s re-
quirements, and it shouldn't be up
to the president to make the rules
for the League. Hopefully Mr.

‘hr

Carter and his advisors will at least:

be sensible enough to reach some
type of compromise before it is too

I greatly appreciate the concern
given by the Pitt News upon my
views, opinions, and votes concem-
ing the recent reduction of funding
for non-preferred appropriations
which would include the University
of Pittsburgh.

First of all, the increase of $200

- for fall tuition really hit home since
two of my children attend Pitt’s
Oakland campus and I heard of the
tuition from them while I tried to
tgplain why the state had not risen
pm’; appropriation to cover in-
creases, due to the year’s_high infla-
tion rate. I introduced an amend-
ment to Pitt’s Appropriation Bill
that would have increased Pitt’s
funding by $700,000, which may
have cushioned any increase that
were necessary. This amendment
did not pass‘ and received the sup‘-

port of most area legislators and lit-
tle support from Philadelphia, even
though I was prepared to offer the
same amendment for Temple
University. I voted for the Ap-
propriations Bill No. 1299, or the
Fee Bill, so that non-preferreds can
be_ fuHy funded through _80-81. I
have always voted for funding for
Pitt and will continue to do so since
I am totally committed to high
quality education for this state and
especially Allegheny County.

The cuts that the Governor had
threatened for the non-preferreds
will surely "lead to higher tuition
rates for the winter/spring term. I
will do,all that I can to help offset
any cuts in aid to Pitt and Temple
since I do not feel it is fair to the ad-
ministration and especially the
students at Pitt who have also felt
the rise in the cost of education and
living. It just seems that certain

areas of the state are not committed
to aid to higher education. These
areas send Representatives to Har-
risburg who have populations with
other interests and, in the past,
fought state funding for public
schools. I feel that intense lobbying
is needed by the students
themselves. They are the ones who
are affected the most by budget cuts
and may not complete their educa-
tion because of the tightening up of
loans‘ and grants. Every’ Pitt stu-
dent should know who represents
them in Harrisburg, and the student
should let them know how they feel.
I have only heard from my children
and a few other students who attend
Pitt their concern toward the tuition
rise for the fall term. The strong
lobbying and pressure upon your
elected official may offset the
threatened cuts for Pitt and Tem-

ple. Without pressure, the legisla-

ture may not pass the Fee Bill
(which needs approximately 30-35
more votes) or deal at all with the
problem of funding for.Pitt and
other non-preferreds. No one likes
to vote for tax increases, especially
in an election year, but maybe this
is what is needed. Maybe a special
lottery could be devised to raise
money for our universities.‘ Legis-
lative budget hassles could be by-
passed, plus the university could be
guaranteed a set amount of money
every year by becoming a preferred
portion of the budget. This is just
one idea and I am sure there are
more. With all the PH.D’s,
Masters, and Bachelor Degrees at
Pitt, maybe a‘ formula could be
worked out that is suitable to the
taxpayers, administration, and
students.

I thank youvagain for the oppor-
tunity to express my views’ and

hopefully, Pitt’s budget problems
can be resolved without any more
tuition increases this year.

LWV ‘Courageous’ for Holding Debate Without Carter

(Continued jrom page 8)
to Anderson.

Anderson may never have a bet-
ter opportunity to capitalize on his
candidacy than in Baltimore, since
subsequent debates sponsored by

“the National Press Club, CBS
’ News, and the Ladies’ Home Jour-

nal are seen as having dimmer
possibilities of being pulled off,
having only been scheduled between
Carter and Reagan. A “test of wills”
or stubbornness may cause Reagan
to rebuke any debates with Carter,

because’ Reagan’s provision of
debating Carter one-on-one was

dependent upon Carter submitting

to a possible three-way debate first

with John Anderson at a site chosen
and sponsored by the LWV,

raw end of this deal, if hot heads
prevail. If neither side gives in, the
public will simply vote their cons-
cience, never truly having an inkling
of why they will vote for the can-
didate of their choice unless they do
some research of the candidates’
records on their own. The majority
of people will simply not take the
time, or claim not to have the time
to research their choices. A debate
between candidates simply gives the
public a chance to envision each
candidate seated in the Oval Office,
based on the way they handle
themselves ‘confronting the issues.
This is not to say that debates are
the best indicator of what a can-
didate will do if elected, but it is us-
ed largelv to shape public opinion

The American public will get the

and help people consider who they

will vote for on Nov. 4.
The LWV should be commended
for not excluding Anderson, since
he did, in fact, meet the criteria set
by the League. It will be interesting,
though, to see what ABC, CBS,
and NBC choose to do on that Sun-
day night. If “-the Big Three” opt to
broadcast in Baltimore, Mr. Carter
could, _in the course of the night,
feel an urge to kick himself squarely
in the pants for being so stubborn,
and if the networks decide not to
carry the debate, the Carter people
may delight in the fading of Ander-
son, whichmay happen even if the
debate between Anderson and
Reagan is televised. ,
The American public, in lieu of
the chances of learning more about
the candidates in the upcoming

debate between Reagan and Ander-
son, may keep an open ear and
open mind to Anderson, as well as
an open eye to what may be read as
fear, on the part of Carter, of the
determined Anderson factor. This
factor, more than any. point
debated verbally between Anderson
and Reagan, will be the most vivid
feature of what may be the only

debate of presidential candidates,

given that Reagan may stick to his
word of not debating Carter since it
appears the President is willing to
take his chances-and his ‘lumps-by
“staying out of the Baltimore can-
test. .

If enough people hear, read, see,

or think about what Anderson is
doing to the Carter _ chances,

Anderson may just get the notice he

has called for, resulting in a higher 1

number of “protest votes” against
Carter. '

If Jimmy wins a second term, it
will not be for the respect he has
among the electorate.

No, if James Earl Carter wins, it
will be by an extremely slim margin
of victory, not in support. of him,
but in “fear” of Reagan, and under
protest by those who share with
Carter the idea that Anderson simp-
ly won’t be elected. That Anderson
factor is causing a _lot of sleepless

"nights for the Carter camp, and is

becoming a drawing card for those
who feel that they can really ‘say

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Sports Editor .

The time has finally come for the
Pitt football team to live up to the
media’s pre-season expectations in
its long-awaited season opener
against Boston College. ABC’s
cameras will be on hand to catch the
Panthers in action against the
Eagles.

A lot of preparation has gone in-
to this game and the season as a
whole. Not only has the team been
preparing, but the band,
cheerleaders, stadium grounds
crew, and everyone else connected
with the team_has been busy for
weeks, even months. They’re all
ready, but the big question is, is the

‘ team‘ ready?

According to head coach Jackie
Sherrill,‘ yes.

“The waiting and the anticipa-
tion are tough,” Sherrill said earlier
this week. “The players and
coaches have practiced for a long
time. I think they’d all like to play a
game. But, you always have a little
uneasiness and concern about the
first game. I know I do.”

Some of that concern is about the
defensive unit, touted as one of the
best, if not the best, in the country.
Injured senior defensive tackle Greg
Meisner will sit out tomorrow’s
game with‘ the Eagles and
sophomore John Hendrick will
start in his place. Sherrill noted that
Meisner is “coming along quickly.”
Also on defense, Jerry Boyarsky
and Bill Neill are both recovering
from injuries suffered in pre-season
workouts, but both are slated to
start come tomorrow.

“A big question is how. much
Jerry Boyarsky and Bill Neill will be
able to play,”said Sherrill.

A“Hopefully, they can play and not

reinjure their injuries.”

Should Neill or Boyarsky not be
able to play, they’ll be replaced by
senior Dave Bucklew attackle. and
either sophomore Phil Puzzuoli or
sophomore Jay Pelusi at middle
guard.

Offensively, the Panthers are '

healthy and will be able to play in
each position, according to Sherrill.
The kicking game," which has been a
big question due to the great
amount of talent in that area, has
been decided for_tomorrow. Dave
Trout will handle kick—offs, extra
points and field goals, and will

share punting duties with junior 1

Rick Ryan or sophomore Dave
Heppler. ' ’
Boston College comes into the

game with an experienced team,

which won four of its last five

games last season, including a 27-10 I“

blitzing of a Syracuse team which
gave Pitt fits before falling 28-21.
“Looking at Boston College, I
see that they are impressive,”Sher-
rill said. “They have a quarterback
who can execute and good running

backs.

“Their defensive secondary has
been together for quite a long
time,” he contimied, “and they can
run and get to the ball very well.”

Indeed Boston College is an ex-
perienced team, as 38 lettermen, in-
cluding 15 starters return from last
year’s 5-6 team. Included among
those returning is junior linebacker
Jim Budness, who was named to
several pre-season all-‘America
teams. .

Baseball May Be Turning Into Bosebrawl

Throughout‘ baseball history, there is folklore
about pitchers who were known as head-hunters.
They were the breed who terrified batters with their
Dizzy Dean was known to
have said that if the situation was right, he’d knock
Sal “The Barber” Maglie

knocked down by Montreal’s Bill Gullickson. As
Jorgenson headed toward the mound, he was
restrained by Montreal catcher Gary Carter, the ‘or
‘Mets’ John Stearns took up the retaliation by tackl-

ing Gullickson.

*On August 9, when Dave Winfield of San Diego

earned his nickname by shaving hitters with his
fastball. The stories of other such pitchers are
endless. i

In recent years,’ pitchers haven’t been as bold in
public but privately have expressed the same feelings
as the old-timers. Brush-back pitch, knockdown
pitch, chin music, call it what you will, but the bean-
ball is making a comeback. -

Montreal’s Bill Lee calls the pitcher-hitter duel a
territorial war. Simply, if a hitter gets too close to
the plate the pitcher has the right to throw well inside
as a reminder to the batter not to take away his ter-
ritory.

The result of such a reminder can and has been
disastrous. This past August marked the 60th an-
niversary of baseball’s most tragic moment:
Chapman was hit in the skull by a fastball thrown by
Carl Mays. Chapman was knocked unconscious and
eventually‘ died as a direct result of the blow.

There are also more recent instances. August 18,
1967, the Boston Red Sox’ Tony Conigliaro was
squarely struck in the left side of his head by a Jack
Hamilton fastball. He was left unconscious and had
to battle back from near death and later near blind-
ness. A promising career was shattered and his com-
back try in the early 70’s fruitless.

During the 1979 season, attention was focused on
Mike J orgenson, then of the Texas Rangers. He was
hit by a fast ball and knocked unconscious. He was
revived soon after but entered a Texas hospital four
days later complaining of severe headaches. While
watching television with his wife and children who
were visiting, J orgenson lapsed into a coma. A blood

clot was being hit by the baseball.

With that episode fresh in the minds of hitters,
they are no longer willing to let pitchers get away
with inside heat. The pot boiled over in Chicago on
May 20. Al Cowens of Detroit was facing relief pit-
cher Ed Farmer of the White Sox. A year earlier,
Cowens had been hit by a Farmer fastball and had his
jaw fractured. With that memory still fresh, Cowens
charged the mound after hitting a flyball to the out-
field. Farmer was decked blindsided and a melee
broke lose. . ‘

That brought the problem into focus but there
have been numerous other brawls due to beanballs.

*On April 20, the Orioles’ Doug Decinces charged
the mound after hit by Mike Proly of the White Sox.

*On May 5, the Brewer’s Ben Oglivie was struck
on the ankle by Proly and he proceeded to blacken
Proly’s eye. . ~- A

*On May 10, Toronto’s Al Woods was hit «by a
pitch thrown by the A’s Rick Langford. A bench-
clearing brawl ensued.

' *On May 17, after the Ranger’s Dave Rajsich serv-
ed up two consecutive homers against the Yankees,
he hit Jim Spencer and another brawl was on.

*On May 30, Buddy Bell of Texas was knocked
down by the Angels Bruce Kison. After ﬂying out,
Bell charged the mound looking for- revenge. That
night in Pittsburgh, the Phillies Kevin Saucier hit
Burt Blyleven and he tried to retaliate by throwing
the ball back. A bench clearing brawl occurred.

*On June 10, Ron Cey of Los Angeles was hit in
the thigh by the Mets’ Pat Zachry after Zachry had
given up back—to-back homeruns. Cey charged the

to deal with the problem. It is the no retaliation rule.
If a pitcher seeks retribution for an earlier beanball,
both he and his manager are ejected from the game.
Two problems are immediately obvious. One, how is
the umpire to know when a pitcher is purposely
throwing at a hitter; and two, the rule lets the first of-
fender off scott free. In other words, it pays to throw
your beanball first. '

mutual understanding between a pitcher and his
teammates must be explained. If I’m a pitcher and
someone throws at my hitters, there is no way I’m go- 
ing to let that happen. I must protect my batters and
they expect that protection. So the threat of ejection
and a fine (usually $50) is miniscule.

- In addition, managers will admit, though not on
record, that at times they wil encourage a pitcher to
throw at a certain opposing hitter.
thinking will keep the beanball alive and well for
many years to come.

National Leagues are at odds about what to do. They
have ‘tried to hand out stiff fines and suspensions but
that is not enough. In the Cowens-Farmer incident,
Cowens was suspended for one week. But the Tigers
weren’t forced to suspend his pay also and that pro-
mpted former Chicago owner Bill Veeck to say, “It’s
as if he’s (Cowens) getting a week’s paid vacation.”

Big Mac Attack Debuts in Second Season as Panther  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Pitt News Sponswriter .

Last year at this _time, Randy
McMillan was faced with an unen-
viable task. Not only did he have to
play fullback .for a major college
football team, but he also had to
prove himself to Pitt followers. He
was a junior college player who led
the entire nation in rushing and yet
was unknown to most fans. When
announced as the starting fullback
on opening day against Kansas,

G. many watched eagerly to see what

    
       
       
     
     

he could do. There’s no need to go
on. “Mac” rumbled for over a
hundred yards and his name was no
longer a mystery.

Now that the burden of recogni-
tion has fallen from his shoulders
and McMillan has established
himself as Pitt’s top ground gainer,
he is looking forward to the new
season.

“Last year was rough. I had to
get adjusted to the new system and I
had some injuries,” he said. “This
year, I feel ready to play and I’m
stronger. I just want to play foot-
ball.”

It’s no secret that many people
feel Pitt is a contender for a na-
tional championship, as evidenced
by the enormous pre-season publici-
ty the Panthers have received.

Will this added pressure affect
the club? No,’ says McMillan.

“We have a lot of quality players
and they all know what they have to
do,” he said. “I don’t think the
added publicity will hurt us. It will,

however, give added incentive to_

our opponents, and they all will be
very psyched to play us.”
Although the Panthers don’t
seem to have a glaring weakness,
some question has been raised on
the quality of the tailbacks. Last
year, Pitt shuffled three backs;
Rooster Jones, Freddie Jacobs and
Artrell Hawkins. This season, much
of the same thing is in store with the
only difference being the departure

of Freddie Jacobs and the arrival of
Bryan Thomas. .

This shufﬂing of tailbacks does
not bother McMillan.

“I’ve heard some talk about us
having "weak tailbacks and I don’t
think that’s true,” he said. “All of
our tailbacks are quality players and
all of them can do the job. I don’t

care who’s in there because I have

confidence in all of them.”

Whether Pitt shuffles tailbacks or
not, McMillan will still be the big-
gest workhorse in the backfield and
he is looking forward to it.

“I really would like to rush for"
over a‘ thousand yards and go-

undefeated,” McMillan said. “We
have a tough schedule, especiallyon
the road, but we definitely have the
talent to go undefeated.”

For Randy McMillan, a year has
made quite a bit of difference.
There’s no fear of not performing
well, no surprises as there were last
year. He’s well-adjusted now and is
looking forward to‘Boston College.

‘‘They’re going to be okay and
will give us a good game because
they’re probably very anxious to
play us,” he said. “The whole team
is ready, however, and I just can’t
wait to get out there.” ‘

Pitt fans can’t wait either to see
the “Big Mac attack” again.

Woman ’s Cross Country

By FRED BEERS

Following a year’s absence at
Pitt, women’s cross country is back
this year, and while head coach
Alfreeda Goff is unsure of how her
squad will do as a team, she does
expect some excellent performances
on the individual level.

“At this point‘, I can’t really ‘say
what the other schools will have,”
said Goff. “We missed last year
because of a budget cut and I don’t
really know whothe other schools

Competition for this year’s squad
will be good but not -top notch.

“We’ll be going against schools
our caliber,” she said. “We won’t
be running against the Penn States
or West Virginias. Competition will
be mostly local. “Junior Margie
Lee should be the squads top run-
ner,” Goff added. “As she took
M.V.P. honors.”

Pantherette Volleyballers Open Against Temple

B3’ SCOT STONE

The Pitt Women’s volleyball
team opens its 1980 season against
its arch rival Temple University this
Friday afternoon at Cleveland
State. That match-up is part of a
tournament which also includes
Kent and Cleveland State. As the
defending Eastern regional champs,
first year coach Shelton Collier ex-

pects the other teams to be “gunn-
ing for us,” but especially fellow
easterner, Temple. '

The Pantherette team will be rely- A

ing on fast accurate serves and a
strong defense to win the tourna-
ment.

“Our goal is to be the number-
one serving team there,” Collier
said. “We’re working hard on that
with each girl on the team.”

The Pitt squad uses a straight
overhand serve exclusively.

“We’re basically a short team,”
Collier said, “and we don’t want
people spiking balls at us, so we’re
going to try to serve extremely
well.” b .

Tennis Team Serves Up Victory

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pantherette tennis team
recorded its first win of the new
season with a 6-3 victory over the
University of Charleston in
Morgantown, West Virginia on
Wednesday.

In singles play the Pantherettes
opened up with four consecutive
wins starting with a 7-5, 7-5 victory
by Rande Belkin over Charle'ston’s
Tina Phillips. That win was follow-
ed by a Cathy Jacobson 6-3, 6-1 win

over Lisa Payne. Sophomore Lisa
LaFuria tallied a 6-0, 6-2 s_core over
her opponent, Kim Tyree. In the
most impressive match of the day,
according to head coach Fran
Webster, Lisa Weinberg, a junior,
defeated Jane Balkhart 6-4, 6-1.

“I thought that in singles play the ,

first four girls played exceptionally
well for their first match,” said
Webster. “Lisa Weinberg played
beyond her ability, she was especial-
ly outstanding in her win.”
Following the four wins by the
Pantherettes, Charleston took the
final two single matches. Pitt’s Jodi
Mattioli was outscored by Barb
Rolland 6-3, 6-3. Jan Kastori of -Pitt
was also defeated by Micki Flowers
6-0, 6-1. Both Pantherettes are

freshman and were competing in
their first collegiate ‘match.

defeated Pitt’s Mattioli and Kastori

“The team’s performance went
beyond what I had expected, con-
sidering that we had a short time to
practice,” said Webster. “We still
have a lot of work to do to compete
with the schedule that we have this
season. Being that we have a very
small squad we are still looking for
any one that is interested in playing
for us.”

The Pantherettes’ next foe will be

is considered probably the best set-
ter in the East, according to Collier.
She acts as a sort of quarterback for
the team, calling plays and assisting
Linda Stadler, , a recent
transfer from the University of Cm-
cinatti, is perhaps the outstanding
spiker in the East. Also, there is
Julie Gaul, a sophomore, whom
Collier regards as a very strong
defensive player and “hard hitter,”
This year’s team is relatively
young and‘ is playing under a new
coach. For the first half of the
season, the Pantherettes are work-
ing on developing a clear team con-
cept of offense and defense. Later
in the year, as the nationals draw
closer, they _will gear their strategy
more to the specific teams they will
be facing. - «

The Pantherette squad has been ;.

logging a lot of time this week in
strenuous work-outs preparing for
the opener. Collier characterizes
them as “enthusiastic,” and the
situation as “a new challenge for all
of us.” _

Pitt is the 1979 defending Eastern
champion team, -and as Collier says
about this weekend’s tournament,
“This is the first step in defending
the title this year, and we have every
intention of doing that.',’

Because most of the teams Pitt
has to play are often three, five, or__

"even 10 hours away, most matches}

are organized into tournaments in-
volving several schools. After this
weekend’s matches, the team will
return to Pitt for the first of only
two home stands, the Pitt Invita-
tional on Sept. 19'.’

If your study technique is typical. you spend 26
hours each week buried in your books. 66-2/3%
of this study time is wasted on an antiquated set
of procedures. Procedures that have remained
unchanged for over a hundred_years.

‘ What's worse. you presume there is nothing
you can do to improve. The prevailing attitude
on campus is "You either have it or you don't!"

What nonsense!

Any student with average intelligence can im-
' prove his reading and study skills at Ieiist 3
times with a) better techniques. b) ecpert coach-
ing, and c) controlled practice. And he can do it
_ quickly—in time to dramatically increase his
grades in the current semester _
For this is precisely what the Evelyn Wbod
course offers, and backs it up with an iron-clad.
no-nonsense. written guarantee.

THE GUARANTEE

Any student who attends every Evelyn Wood
class, completes the required practice, yet does
not improve reading and study skills at least 3
times will be eligible to receive a full tuition refund.

Evelyn Wood course. The answers were varied,
but mostly on the same wave length: 1) They
wanted to reduce their study time; 2) They
wanted to feel more conﬁdent in class. more in
control; and 3) They wanted to learn more. to
achieve better grades.

At the end of the course. each student was
asked if his goals were met. Over 95% said yes.
'lTie other 5% received their tuition back

Why Do Most Students
Read Slowly? '

Most students have no idea what their reading
ability is. If they are typical, they read about 300
words per minute for one page of a novel). Why
is it that students read at viitually the same speed,
considering how very different they all are?

The cause can be traced back to the First
Grade. When we were taught to read. we were
asked to read out loud. word-by-word. Later, in
the Second Grade. we were asked to stop saying
each word out loud. But we never really did. Fact
is, you're saying these words right now—not out
loud, but to yourself, one word at a time!

This means you read only as fast as you talk-
about 250 to 300 words per minute. (As if to
prove the point. Guiness's Book of World Records
lists John E Kennedy as delivering the fastest
speech ever at 327 words per minute). 2

How Do You Learn To Read
Faster? With The Same
Comprehension?

At the Mini-Lesson you will find out how the
Evelyn Wood course eliminates the habit of read-
ing only one word at a time. How you can learn
to read 3 or 4 words instead of only one. To see
how natural this is. look at the dot in_the middle
of this phrase:

the grass - is green

Try as you may. you can‘t help but see the
other words. VVith training. you learn to use this
natural, but un-used potential. You learn to see
groups of words simultaneously This will double.
triple. possibly quadruple your present ability

_ This concept is diametrically opposed to the

skimming is a dirty word!
The PRICE BOILS DOWN
TO $2 AN HOUR.
Read what the University of lllinois student
paper said (Ed Sejud): "If a student avails hirmelf
of all the facilities by the (Evelyn Wood) lnstitute
and attends all the class sessions, the price boils _
down to only about $2 an hour, cheaper than any
private tutoring you'll ever ﬁnd. Spread over four
years, the course can save thousands of study
hours and an probablyaffectaboostin astudent‘s
grade-point average. Assignments which once
took days can be accomplished in a matter of
hours, leaving much more time for other pursuits.
The lnstitute estimates that it can save average
students 350 hours of study time each semester-
probably an understatement". '
