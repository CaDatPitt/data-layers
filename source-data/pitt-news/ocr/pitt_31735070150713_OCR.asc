Student

charged
with bomb
threat

A Pitt graduate student is await-
ing trial after allegedly making
bomb threats‘ against Pitt last
month. A
Nancy Bruni, a graduate stu-

dent in Pitt’s sociology depart— W

ment, was charged with making
terroristic threats and threat-
ening to use weapons of mass
destruction, according to court

— documents. A preliminary hear-

ing for Bruni is scheduled for
June 12.

The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
reported that a woman called
Pitt police shortly before 5 p.m.
Wednesday, March 20, saying
she had a message on her phone
stating that two explosives were
set to go off in Posvar Hall, one
at 6:30 p.m. and the other at
7:30 p.m. An hour later, the Pitt
policereceived another call from
a student in Bruni’s class who
had found a written note with a
similar message in a bathroom.

Bruni taught a class from 6
to 8:30 p.m. in Posvar Hall on
the Wednesday evening she al-

-legedly made the bomb threats.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
that Bruni is no longer teaching
at the University. '
According to the Post—Ga-
zette, Bruni said she sought to
use the bomb threats as reason
to cancel class because she suf-
fered from heightened anxiety

her auburn hair, were referring
to the 14 participants in Rainbow
Alliance’s 12th annual charity
drag show. The show was part
of the group’s Pride Week, which
works toward raising awareness
of LGBTQ community issues.
Two celebrity drag queens, Pitts-
burgh local Sharon Needles and
her co—star Alaska of a thundrous
last name, both from “RuPaul’s
Drag Race,” attended the event,
and the Main Floor of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union transformed its
men’s and women’s bathrooms
into gender-neutral areas for the
length of the evening.

The Drag Show’s participants’

stage names were as colorful as
their sequined ensembles — the
night included performances by
queens Condomeeza Spice and
Anita Strapén. .

In order to perform at the
show, the dancers went through
an application process that be-
gan in February, Rainbow Alli-
ance President Tricia Dougherty

said. Rainbow Alliance posted

flyers and sent out emails in
search of performers for the
most recent edition of the drag
show.

Dougherty said that the per-
formers included Pitt alumni
and University staff as well as

students. Some had only start-
ed performing indrag recently,
while others had years of expe-
rience.

Proceeds from the event ben-
eﬁt the Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force. Dougherty said this group
provides a variety of services to
the Rainbow Alliance, includ-
ing HIV testing, free condoms
and safe—sex workshops. Before
the show began, she said that
she hoped to raise about $1,000
through tips for the dancers.

on health and illness. Police traced the
ﬁrst call back to Bruni and confronted
her after she completed teaching a class
last week.

Bruni didn’t respond to multiple re-
quests for comment. -

Fedele said Pitt didn’t send out an
emergency notiﬁcation system alert to
evacuate Posvar following the threat be-
cause it was considered “lower level.”

“The threat  was categorized under
the protocol as a lower level threat, which
is less serious in nature and which permits
officers to search the building, without
evacuation, by inspection, use of K-9 of-
ficers and use of explosive detectors,”
Fedele said. .

Fedele also said that there was no
connection between the March 20 bomb
threats and the threats that plagued Pitt
during the spring semester of the 2011-
2012‘ school year.

“Police have found no connection be-
tween Bruni and the other threats,” Fedele
said. “This was an isolated incident.” I

As he prepared for the start of a 50-hour-
long biking marathon, Pi Kappa Phi’s
social chairman, jtiinior Bryan Greene,
reflected on his pasﬁexperiences with one
of the fraternity’s biggest philanthropy
events.  A A '

“The first year wedid it I gota call from
a kid in Minnesota who had cerebral palsy,
and he thanked me  raising money. We
only raised $2,ooolt-hat year, so it didn’t
seem like that much_£at first. It wasn’t until
this kid called and thanked me that I real-

ized it was a big  and that it meant 

Union. The event will last until 6 p.m. Sat-
urday, until which time the participating
brothers will continually cycle on station-
ary bikes set up at the spot. Proceeds from
the event will go toward the fraternity’s
national charity, Push America.

PKP President Braxton Ambrose, a ju-
nior accounting and finance major, said
Push America beneﬁts people with severe
handicaps and works toward changing the
way in which the public views people with
disabilities. According to Push America’s
website, the program was founded in 1977.

With the bikeathon, Ambrose said the
group hopes to recreate the national Push
America event, Journey of Hope, which is
a cross-country bike ride from Califor-
nia to Washington, D.C., that spans the
course of a summer. Last year, riders at

Pi Kappa Phi hosts annual bikeathon for A
 Push America until Saturday

— 4 p.m. Thursday outside the William Pitt

Pitt’s bikeathon logged 3,717.11 miles --
nearly as far as those who participated in
the nationwide trek. He said 270 sorority
members have volunteered to help the 93
PKP brothers by doing their part cycling
during the 50-hour bikeathon.

“We’re setting up ﬁve stationary bikes ,

outside of the Union and hoping to get as
many miles as we can in support ofjourney
of Hope and Push America,” Ambrose said.
The University temporarily provides
the bikes to PKP, according to Ambrose.
Ambrose said the event organizers will
continuously update the mileage achieved
on a white board next to the riders while
trying to log as many miles as they can.
According to an article previously pub-
lished in The Pitt News, PKP began the

 returned to campus earlier in the year. ica chair, said that this year his fraternity the bikeathon called “Spread the Word to
' End the Word,” a campaign to stop us:
ing the word “retarded” in a derogatory
manner.

“We will have cards out for people to
sign and pledge that they will stop using
the word. It’s a big aspect of the bikeathon
this year,” Martin said.

Martin said that representatives from
United Cerebral Palsy will stop by the

l bikeathon today to watch the event and
take pictures. The brothers of PKP plan to
present to these representatives the Circle
of Giving grant, a monetary donation of
$1,250, according to Martin.

As the event began Thursday, a D]
started up the music and ﬁve bikes were
lined up, ready to start the nonstop activ-
ity for the next 50 hours.

According to Martin, Bruegger’s Bagels
and 5-Hour Energy are donating products
to the riders this year in support of the
bikeathon and Push America.

Preparing for possible rain showers,
the brothers have set up tents over the
bikes to keep their riders dry.

Because of its prominent location on
Pitt’s campus, Ambrose hopes the event
can attract a critical mass of support and
attention.

DRAG SHOW

Rainbow Alliance seemed well on its way
to meeting the goal.

Clad in gold hot shorts, Bubbles -
portrayed by Pitt senior Trevor Bublitz —
elicited a frenzy from the audience as she
danced. Audience members threw money
at the her more quickly than she could
reach out to grab it from their hands.

Ignoring the mess of outstretched
arms surrounding her, she only stopped
her dancing when a powerful hip thrust
caused her wig to dislodge itself from her
head. After a pause from the initial shock,
she jumped right back into her routine.

 

    

Near Patrick Harris, on the other
hand, sported a more conservative outﬁt.
Dressed in a sleek suit and patent-leather
shoes, the drag king performed “Nothing
Suits Me Like a Suit,” popularized by Neil
Patrick Harris’ character in the television
show “How I Met Your Mother.”

For Taylor Paglisotti, the Pitt senior
who portrayed Harris, drag is an escape
from everyday living, if only for a mo-
ment.

“Drag reminds me that there are places
where I can be myself and be ridiculous
at the same time‘ and that people appreci-
ate that,” Paglisotti said before the show.
“On days where I feel like, ‘Oh, I should
put this necklace on because it is more

it makes me feel like there is merit in the
gray areas between the categories of man
and woman.”

In addition to dance routines such as
Harris’ number, the event also includ-
ed segments that educated the public.
Dougherty said the performances blurred
gender lines, providing a valuable experi-
ence for the event’s attendees.

“In between the performances, we have
information about why people do drag and
information about gender performances
and the theoretical concepts behind it,”
Dougherty explained before the show.

And in a surprise announcement in
between performances, members of the

Rainbow Alliance told the crowd that as of
nextsemester, student groups will be able
to ﬁll out a form at Pitt’s Student Health
Services to obtain 100 free condoms to
distribute at events. 7

After 12 years, the drag show has even
cultivated a fanbase at Pitt and in the city
of Pittsburgh. _

Juniorjason Howell, who has attended
Rainbow Alliance’s charity drag show for
the last six years, said the show gets bet-
ter every year.

Field of digital humanities important
but threatening to traditional research

Eric Baldwin

Columnist

While academia as a whole is facing
a crisis in terms of its identity and
social role, it is also experiencing
a crisis from within, where the re-
plenishing of the academic ranks
—— a feudal apprenticeship known
as graduate school — is beginning
to unravel. And no area is more af-
fected-than the humanities.

The disciplines that compose
the humanities face an identity cri-
sis unlike the problems facing even
social science and physical and life

. sciences. There is an academic at-

mosphere permeating academia
that values the amount of research
grant revenue a faculty member
can bring in over the quality of his
or her academic work. It has left
the humanities more vulnerable
to austerity measures and many
freshly minted Ph.D.s out on the
street, both metaphorically and
literally.

A new methodology in the hu-
manities has arisen in the past 30

years known as the “digital hu-

manities.” This interdisciplinary
methodology uses means provided
by digital mediums to answer re-

search questions that were previ-
ously unanswerable or questions
had not yet arisen because digital
mediums had not yet been pro-
duced yet, or were not sufficiently
common or were not developed
enough to answer research ques-
tions.

Proven and long—established
methods of inquiry compose most
of traditional humanities work.
Until the late 1980s, humanities
research was conducted in the
same way it had been conducted
hundreds of years earlier, asking
the same style of questions and
answering them using the same
methods. '

With the introduction of the
very ﬁrst hints of what would later
become known as the digital hu-
manities, only the most pioneer-
ing of graduate students and their
doctoral supervisors conducted

‘ such work. Using computational

methods in the humanities re-
quires a particular skill set that
many humanists lack: a combina-
tion of a depth of knowledge in a
humanistic discipline ‘or topic and
the sufficient expertise in computer

‘science, speciﬁcally in manipulat-

ing digital texts in a variety of pro-

gramming languages. This com-
bination of skills is unusual and
difficult to acquire.

Aside from the intricacies of
what constitutes the digital hu-
manities, its broader manifesta-
tion raises a series of questions that
are both disturbing and positive.
While computational methods al-
low scholars to explore new hu-
manities questions, beneﬁtting
the academic community at large
with interesting and innovative
results, they can also push tradi-
tional humanities research off the
metaphoric radar.

More importantly, I argue that
while the digital humanities are
a good use of interdisciplinary
methods to conduct certain types
of research, they threaten the in-
herent nature of the humanities,
which is not clear, quantiﬁable or
the product of the manipulation of
data, but the result of the examina-
tion of ambiguities and subjective
concepts.

However, the digital humanities
offer a unique beneﬁt to thelarge
research universities that have the
capacity to sustain large research

projects, such as initiatives in the digital
humanities. While small liberal arts colleges
might also be well—positioned to accomplish
work in the digital humanities because of
the high likelihood of collaboration at such
colleges, research universities are far better
positioned to carry out major interdisciplin-
ary and interinstitutional digital humanities
initiatives.

These large public and private research 

institutions are eager to attract faculty mem-
bers who are not only doing work in the

digital humanities but who are also attract—, A

ing research—grant funding for these proj-

ects. Given that the digital humanities is an
emerging ﬁeld, many public and private sec-
tor funding sources are eager to fund these
projects. With new sources of grant fund-
ing in the humanities, an area where grant
funding is scarce'and minimal compared to

. funding in other areas, research in the digital

humanities is a route for university admin-
istrations to get humanities departments to
carry their own ﬁnancial weight,_,like many
departments in the health and physical sci-

ences .do', through grant rather than

general university budget appropriation. *
While I am in favoifof innovation and

interdisciplinary workmlsuch as the digital’ '
humanities, I am alarmed by not only the V 1

potential -for marginalization and dismissal

of traditional humanities work,‘ but also by. j V

the dangerous precedent that grant funding
for work in the digital humanities creates
for other humanities scholars, ultimately
prioritizing obtaining grants over the pursuit,
of genuine intellectual cultivation. "
Recent Ph.D. graduates are entering an
academic job market that cares more about
their ability to attract funding than whether
their work is unique and interesting. A recent
article in the Chronicle of Higher Education
claims, “No DH [Digital Humanities], no
interview.” While I value the digital humani-
ties and think that, as society and academia
become more digitally oriented, it is criti-
cal that scholars receive training in digital
methods, I ask the question: At what cost
does this come to our academic integrity? I

BASEBALL

After three close losses at USF, Pitt aims to rebound at home

Nate Barnes
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Pitt baseball returns home this
weekend for a three—game slate
against Big'East rival Notre Dame,
a series that kicks off a 12-game
homestand for the Panthers.

The Panthers (21-9, 3-3 Big East)
were swept in their last outing of
Big East play against South Florida
and will look to move their confer-
ence record above .500 when they
face the Fighting Irish (19-11, 4-5
Big East). "

Notre Dame will serve as yet
another test in a season packed
with quality competition for the
Panthers. But the Irish haven’t
performed well on the road this
season — with a 5-6 record away
from South Bend  and arrive in
Pittsburgh having lost back-to-back
games at home against Villanova
and Michigan.

Meanwhile, Pitt has performed
nearly perfectly at Cost Field, win-
ning 10 of12‘games at home.

Ethan Mildren (5-2) will lead the
Panthers into the weekend Friday,
taking the mound against Notre
Dame’s Pat Connaughton (0-1).
Connaughton has only made three

starts so far and recently joined the
team after the basketball season
ended. ,

Mildren has undeniably become
Pitt’s ace, throwing a complete
game in his last outing against USF.
On the year, Mildren has thrown 60
innings in eight starts and struck
out 40 batters. '

Most impressive about Mildren’s
numbers to date is how poorly op-
posing batters fare against him. He
has allowed only 49 hits and walked
just 13 batters this season, and hit-
ters are batting .230 against him.

Saturday, Pitt will likely see
Adam Norton (7-0) on the mound
for Notre Dame. Norton, the No. 1

starter on the Irish pitching staff,

leads his teammates with a 1.70
earned run average.

In his eight starts this season,
Norton has thrown one complete-
game shutout and 57 and two-thirds
innings overall. His strikeout total
is relatively low at 36 on the year,
but he has only allowed 56 hits.

Pitt will counter with Matt
Wotherspoon (4-1), who leads the
Panthers with 46 strikeouts. Woth-
erspoon is another one of Pitt’s
workhorses, having thrown 58 and
one—third innings this season.

The team’s pitching ‘staff, led by Ethan Mildren, has performed well
recently. Zach Schaffer j Staff Photographer

Sunday’s series ﬁnale will see
Rhys Aldenhoven (5-0) face off
against Notre Dame’s Matt Temow-
chek (4-1). Aldenhoven owns the
best ERA of any Pitt starter, with
a 2.52 mark.

Ternowchek is slated to make
just his third start of the season
after spending much of the year in
the bull pen. In the 27 innings he
has pitched, teams have scored 10
runs against Ternowchek.

But Ternowchek is also a high-
volume strikeout pitcher, fanning
20 batters in that span, so his
style might require Pitt hitters to
be patient in the batter’s box this
weekend.

Offensively, Pitt should expect I

to hold the advantage over the op-
position. The Irish hit .265 as a
team while Pitt holds a .303 team
average.

But that’s not to say Notre Dame
cannot pose a threat at the plate.
The Irish are led by the Big East’s
leading hitter, Eric Jagielo, who’s
hitting .392 with seven home runs
and 28 RBIs through 30 games.

' Jagielo also leads the conference
in slugging percentage (.667) and

SOFTBALL

Panthers look to regain confidence against Seton Hall

Megan Boyle
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

The Pitt softball team is on an eight-
game losing streak. On Wednesday,
the team suffered its most recent de-
feat against in-state rival Penn State
by a score of 11-7.

According to team members, the
problem isn’t talent: It’s conﬁdence.

“We need to just realize we can

win. We have the talent, it’s there. We
just need to ﬁgure out what we need
to do to give everything we have,”
sophomore pitcher Savannah King
said.

The team will try to break the
streak this weekend as it travels to
Seton Hall for a series of conference
games. The Panthers (14-20, 3-6 Big
East) will match up against the Pi-
rates (13-19, 1-7 Big East) with the
opportunity to showcase the ability
King knows she and her teammates

Freshman Tori Nirschl is one of the few players who has had sus-
tained success at the plate. Andy Slepman | Staff Photographer

possess.
The Panthers will look to their un-

' derclassmen to step up and make an

impact. A pair of sophomore pitch-
ers, King and Alexa Larkin, will ﬁnd

themselves equally matched against -

SHU sophomore Danielle Destaso,
who has an ERA of 3.23 — slightly
beating King’s 3.25 and Larkin’s 4.14.

One area where the Panthers have
struggled of late is offense. V

. “We have to keep putting the ball
in play — that’s the goal,” sopho-
more Carissa Throckmorton said,
regarding the aspect of the game that
has emerged as the team’s Achilles’
heel. .

The team is batting .233 com-
paredtothe Pirates’ .279. Senior Hol-
ly Stevens will hope to build on the
batting performance she displayed
Wednesday when the team faced
Penn State. She hita grand slam in
the second inning and tied the pro-

gram’s career RBI record with 120.
Not only does the improved of-
fensive performance pay obvious
dividends on the scoreboard, it also
has a restorative effect on the team’s
morale. Sophomore outﬁelder Carly
Thea commented, “It deﬁnitely gives

' us a bettervibe.”

Given the team’s collective dif-
ﬁculties at the plate, freshman Tori
Nirschl, leadingthe team with acur-
rent batting average of .308 and ato-
talof eight home runs, must continue
to be a dominant force at bat if the
team wants to match the produc-
tivity of Seton Hall’s Yasmin Harrell
and her teammates. The versatile
freshman leads the team in batting
average (.349), hits (37), runs scored
(21) and stolen bases (18).

The series begins with a double-
header Saturday starting at noon,
followed by the third and ﬁnal game
on Sunday, also beginning at noon.

Performing Well, Pitt baseball

Worth the trip up the hill

>.

Cost Field is a great place to watch a game. Shelton Satenstein | senior Staff Photographer

Nate Barnes
Senior Stqff Writer

The best team at Pitt this year does not play
at the Petersen Events Center or at Heinz
Field. It has no recruits anyone heard about
before they stepped on campus, but it does
have former players who have made it to the
professional ranks.

The best team on Pitt’s campus this year is
the baseball team, the varsity one that plays
at Cost Field in the corner of upper campus.

Pitt (21-9, 3-3 Big East) nearly cracked
the top 25 of the collegiate baseball national
rankings, rising as high as No. 26. The same
media outlet projects it will acquire a No.
,3 seed in the Eugene region of the College
Baseball World Series.

In essence, in case you missed it, Pitt
baseball has done some pretty impressive
things already this season and looks like it
will do more.

To start the year, Pitt won all three of its

games against the Wichita State Shockers in ‘

Kansas. The sweep marked the ﬁrst time in
43 years the Shockers had gotten swept at
home in February.

After taking two of three from Wofford in
South Carolina, Pitt was riding high with a 5-1
record —- the team’s best start in a decade.

But Pitt came back down to earth the next
weekend at the Bulldog Challenge, during
which Pitt lost three games to The Citadel,
UNC-Asheville and Virginia Commonwealth.

Players responded well to the losing

stretch, though, winning eight of their next
10 games between the Panther Classic I and
the Panther Classic II.

And then it came time to start Big East
play.

Last season, Pitt won 10 conference
games and ﬁnished 10-17 in the Big East,
28-28 on the year.

Mirroring the beginning of its regular
season, Pitt pulled off a historic sweep, this
time of the defending Big East tournament
champion, St._]ohn’s, in_NewYork. It was the
ﬁrst time the Red Storm had gotten swept at
home in 17 years.

The sweep of the Johnnies launched the
Panthers into an eight—game winning streak
that brought the team into April with a 20-6
record —— almost as many victories as Pitt
tallied in all of 2012. Pitt’s hot start to the
season primarily resulted from a powerful
offense, with the team tallying double-digit
run totals almost every time it took the ﬁeld.

But the team once again encountered
some momentary struggle when it traveled
to Tampa this past weekend for a Big East
series against the USF Bulls.

The Bulls swept the Panthers by silenc-
ing Pitt’s bats, holding the Panthers to just
nine runs on 15 hits in three games —— totals
Pitt had registered multiple times in single
games earlier in the season.

Pitt lost all three games by a single run
and blew two late—game leads. On Saturday,
