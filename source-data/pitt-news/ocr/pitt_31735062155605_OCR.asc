National Student Association  

Votes Negative On Prof Case  

. National.'Student Association (NSA) voted ‘down a reso-
lution designed to “strengthen” its academic freedom’ stand.

‘Recently at its sixth, congress in Columbus, Ohio, NSA dele-
. gates disapproved‘ of the motion that “a professor’s refusal

grounds for dismissal.”

An Associated Collegiate Press
release stated that the organiza-
tion, comprising , college student
congresses, got too ‘tangled in par-
liamentary debate. Before a de-
cision ‘was reached the meeting
had to adjourn.

Pitt Didn’t Join
Last January, inheated debate,
Pitt. Student ‘Congress voted not
to -join the NSA. Charges were
thrown at it as being a Communist
front organization and affiliated
with“ the American Civil Liberties

Union. ‘
But at the time of the vote
charges 'of “pink” activities were

‘to ‘testify using the Fifth Amendment is not justiﬁable

shoved out and the ﬁnal decision
was reached for economyreasons.
Neither WSA nor Men's Council
felt its advantages merited the
high expense inyolved in joining
the organization. .
. Reverses Stand

At the convention, NSA revers-
ed stands that it had taken in
previous years. Delegates reject-
ed a bid to send a delegate to the
Warsaw meeting of the Interna-
tional Union of Students; turned
down the 18-year old vote issue;
and decided not ‘to attempt any
further student exchange behind
the -Iron Curtain. ‘

Former Coach‘ Blasts”

Football ‘Hypocrisy’

Jeff Cravath, former head coach of the University of
Southern California, writing in the current Collier’s, blasts
“the hypocrisy” of college football. -

“Nearly all colleges still playing big-time schedules have-

been forced into the open’ market’

to obtain their raw material. They
must bid for the best players——
and make concessions to them,” he
says. “The fact that the system
reduces the boys to perjurers,
scalpers and "football gigolosis ig-
nored.”
In his article Cravath asserts:
“I have broken college football’s .
“recruiting rules” with the best
of ‘them, but never without
feeling that e the methods ' by
which all of us obtained and
maintained players were rotten
and corrupt.” ' '
“Most stories you hear or read
about the high salaries paid col-
lege football players are not true.
In a typical major university, you

will ﬁnd three or four rookies on g
the varsity squad get nothing, _not_~

even a campus job. ,
“The majority of players get
‘scale,’ which in the Coast Con-
ference when I was coaching in-
"eluded tuition, a- campus job-
yielding a maximum of $75 a.

1
,_,'

month, and $25 a month under
the table from analumnus spon-
sor, and I don’t think the scale

'’has decreased_in the three years
I left. A few players get slight-
ly above scale, $35 to $50 a
month from alumni sponsors.”

- Most coaches believe that many
evils could be eliminated, the for-
mer coach says, if control of the
game were taken out of ‘the hands
of “well—meaning but ﬂoundering
faculty athletic representatives
and given» over to the men who
know college football best, the
athletic directors of the school's.”

All In A Day”s Work . N. .

V  " "October :16, ' 1953 ‘  ‘ ' ’

By JUDITH GOTTERER
James McGrew is a one-
man pocket-adventure book.
At 36, he has lead a more

varied life than almost, any
student at Pitt. "

Among the adventures McGrew

“considered “all in a day’s work”
into '

were his parachute jump
France from a plane riddled-by
German bullets, his job as plun-
derer for the French Underground,
and his court martial by the Ges-
tapo. *
All This, and Stories, Too

He ‘has played in a Broadway
show, written pageants, lectured
on Palestine, worked as a press
agent, acted on radio, and fought.
in the Korean War. He also has
had three short stories published.

At present, McGrew divides his
time between originating and pro-
ducing his own radio show and
studying at Pitt as a non—degree
student. .

His shows, a series of “sophisti-
cated comedies,” will be packaged
presentations-—.tape recordings sent

- through a central production com-

pany to be sold to local stations
throughout the country. As soon
as his shows get on the road he in-
tends to continue with his original
plan of producing it for television.
He Jumped Over France

While ﬂying over France during

World War II, McGrew was shot

1 down andforced to parachute out.

For three months he worked
with the French Underground Re-
sistance, plundering Nazi supplies:
One of his most memorable raids
with the group, called Tabu, was
on a warehouse held by le Donne-
J euneuse, the French fascist youth

organization.

The underground group lived in
a "Cabin in the woods, le Bois de
l’Hopital in Cote d’Or. f‘In Decem-

, ber, ’43, the SS surrounded us. We

were out-numbered. They started
shooting like mad.” Of his group
of 15, three were killed and three

‘wounded. McGrew and the sur-

vivors were taken to Chaumont,
where he was kept in solitary con-
ﬁnement for 100 days.
Sole Survivor _
1 Of the others, he says, “They

’were lucky. They were shot after

10 days.” He was the only survi-
vor. '

{A court martial by the Gestapo
followed. A German major de-

‘ fended him at the trial which was

Alumni Shell Out

The “living endowment” in-

come, totaling $88,839,'was con-

tributed by nearly 5,000 alumni.
Of these alumni 403 are members
of the Pitt Century Club, alumni
who gave annual gifts of $100 or
more. Names of contributors are

week by the General Alumni As-
sociation of the University.

Purpose of the Alumni Giving
Fund is to promoteﬂthe progress of

carried on entirely in German
with English interpretation for

Capt. McGrew. The outcome of the '

trial, however, was never trans-

_lated for him. Six weeks later,

escorted by two guards, he was
sent to Stalag 1 in Barth, Germany
near the Baltic Ocean.

McGrew has no complaint about
prison camps, but adds, “You do
get hungry occasionally.”

Freed After VE Day

Soon after VE Day, he was freed
and sent home.

While on terminal leave from
the Air Force, McGrew played a
Pfc., a bit part, in an army play,
“A Sound of Honey.” _The play
starred Sam Levene and Frank
Lovejoy, both of whom he under-
studied. Included in the cast was
a newcomer, Burt Lancaster.

McGrew lived with iGene.Lyons,
television actor, while rehearsing

the play. “A Sound,” an “artistic,

success,” ran two weeks in Phila-
delphia and three on Broadway.
According to McGrew, it was an
army play which suffered from bad

timing. The public didlnot want
a war play in 1945.
Stories Clicked

McGrew went out to Hollywood
in ’48 and there tried his luck
writing short stories. Three stories
clicked almost immediately and
were published in the Sunday sup-
plement of The Ontario “Star,”

the “National Home Monthly”
(Canada’s “Ladies Home Jour-
nal,”‘), and a New York digest-
type magazine. His agent, an Eng-
lishman, was responsible for the
Canadian printings.

In Dating Survey

Social graces were rated ﬁrst as
attributes of a “good date” in a
recent,_poll of college students by
“Pageant”.magazine. According to
the survey, made in colleges and
universities throughout the nation,
most girls’ want boys to be
smooth in manners and appear-
ance and vice versa. .

In all cases, the students want
their dates to be‘ good dancers.
Willingness to “neck” is far down
on the list. The survey claims that
coming from the right family and
being prominent in social activi-
ties are -not primary concerns of
college students.

Save Your Money, Men

University Deans have approved a Student Congress

request for a Victory rally Monday at 9:30 a.m, in the event

that Pitt should beat Notre Dame in South Bend tomorrow.
The rally is scheduled for one hour and one hour only.
University officials have made it plain that they do not
want any of, the type of victory celebration that followed
last year’s win over the Irish. They want a nice, controlled
rally that will be conﬁned to the campus and will not prove
destructive to the University or any of the neighboring col-
leges._ In light of the recent proclamation, drawn up by rep-
resentatives of the various schools, that places the respon-'~
sibility of victory-rally damages to other campuses on the-
oifending college, it will be well to remember that we don’t
want to be the ﬁrst to break the pact and the ﬁrst to ab-
sorb a damage bill.

An A ffsir of Honor

We of the Pitt,News are a tough-skinned group. Slights,
rebuffs, and insults, usually roll off and collect in a puddle,
but the recent Tech Tartan coup of slipping a Tech reporter
into the University as a spy is an affront which has pene-
trated that tough skin and’. produced a wound will heal
only when soothed with the balm of a duel on the field

of honor. ‘

The time is past for apologies from the long—hairecl,
skirt-clad men from Tech. Our cheek_ has felt the sting
of the glove, but they shall feel the pain of dishonor when
they fall before a righteous and indignant foe’. ,

, Come, gentlemen, do not waste time! This is a chal-
lenge. Name your weapons and we will show you their
use. .

By John De Ninno

Industries, institution, and foundations have
given millions of dollars to Pitt in the past few
years to help ﬁnance medical research and expan-
sion. The money given has been put to good use
if new buildings and serums mean anything. Be-
cause of these accomplishments, the people of Pitts-
burgh and especially people connected with the
University have every right to
extend their chests with pride.
Humbly Grateful

At the same time they should

Abe humbly grateful for the op-
portunity presented us as a re-
sulet of the grants given the
medical center.

We can never repay the ‘in-
stitutions that contribute’ this
money, and I doubt that they ,
wantto be repaid. However, we, can add to the
grants already given, if for no other reason than
to show that we students appreciate and recogniz
the greatness of our medical center. '* ‘

Give Profits to Charity

There are severalvdances-held there each yar.

The proﬁt realized from these affairs, for the most
part, goes into a fund which ﬁniances further so-
cial affairs and covers any losses these‘ functions
incur. That is a logical use for the proﬁts, but
it would be a ﬁne gesture if one dance a year was
held with the proceeds going to some foundation
that contributes to the University. '

 

 

. Let‘s Give Charity a Cutback

The dance would not necessarily be one that is
held annually, already, such‘ as the Christmas Ball
or Spring Dance. Student Congress could get away
from their politics long enough to create another
dance-_—a beneﬁt dance. 1

As far as Pitt is ‘concerned, the Damon Runyon
Cancer Fund has been very generous. Therefore

that would be an excellent organization to which‘

begin contributing. Besides the fund’s generosity
there is another, mercenary, reason for choosing it."
Winchell is Chairman

Walter Winchell is chairman of the fund and,
because of this, a dance held for the beneﬁt of his

_4 pet charity would cause him to give it a good deal
, of publicity. Another point is» that artists visiting

the local night spots would be a lot, more will-

ing to help out the cause if it’s for such a well‘

known foundation.‘

Last year a group in East End held such a bene-
ﬁt dance for the Runyon Fund and besides national
publicity drew famous entertainers from practi-
cally‘ every nitery in town. And of course they
gave their services gratis.

Formal or Informal-

According to the wishes of the students the
dance could be informal or isemi-formal.‘

Students are asked to contribute to many causes
and they usually do. In "most cases you contribute
the money and have only a warm glow inside for
thanks. If you ‘buy a ticket to "a beneﬁt show you

not only have the warm ‘ glow but probably ‘a, good

 

time besides._ I

Keep Off the Bandwagon . 

I

No Outside Influence, Please

By Irene Rozakisl

Americans are ‘constantly con-
demned by other groups for try-
ing to “keep up with the J onses.”
But it’s not going to be easy to
remove this false set of values as
long as our universities persist in
perpetuating the c u s t o m of
climbing onto the proverbial

, bandwagon.

Here at Pitt, so many of _the
recently-adopted policies and at-
titudes seem to be directed to-
ward that rather directionless
bandwagon. Lately we have
adopted policies that add little or
nothing to the school’s worth.
So it appears that the reason for
adopting these ideas is. simply
that Harvard or Yale or Ohio
State is doing it.

Pitt Clamored
Other schools had chapters of

V Phi Beta Kappa. for years, so Pitt

had to clamor until Phi Beta

' Kappa condescended to form ‘a

chapter here.

PBK, is a nice little organiza-
tion for the recognition of scho-
lastic achievement. But it is dif-
.ﬁcult to ﬁnd Ways in which the
school has been concretely im-
proved as a result of having a
chapter.

Similarly, in the case of the

newly-adopted honors system,
what are the advantages? Surely

It's $1.50. Now, . .

Barbers Raise
By Paul Harrison

News item: Area barbers raise

-prices from $1.25 to $1.50 for

men’s‘ haircuts Thursday, Oct. 15.

Pittsburgh’s' tonsorial parlors
raised their standards (prices)
yesterday. Now, when a man
walks into his favorite sweet-
smelling den hergets a bigger
trimming along with his trim.
Three Styles

The whole idea of clipping the
top of the dome started in the
seventh century when the Monas-
tic era decided on three deﬁnite
styles for men’s coiffeurs.

The most popular was the
Eastern, or Greek depending on

the origin of one’s ancestors and

the language one spoke (natural-
ly most people spoke Eastern).
Actually it didn’t matter what it
was called because in either case
the whole head was shaved. How-

ever,‘ people saved . time and trips  

one’s future employer will not
take the trouble to check on

whether or not one was an hon- ’

ors or pass major. The labels
“honor” and “pass” prove’very
little about the individual’s abil-
ities, and the disadvantages in the
system outweight the advantages.

' \ l 0 o
More Restrictions
To the student it represents,

more restrictions on a schedule‘

already cramped by such things
as ﬁeld requirements. To the in-
structor, especially in some of the
creative courses, "it means added
headache and red tape.

Another example of “keeping
up with the J onses” is the current
furor about erecting new build-
ings on the lawn, particularly.in
reference to a student union.

From all corners of the build-
ing come the _self-pitying voices
of those who bemoan the fact that
Pitt is a street-car school. ‘‘Don’t
you want a campus school?” they
ask indignantly. My answer is
“What for?” ,There’s no reason
why “street-car school” has to be
a term of contempt.

It May Not Be

What I’m gettingat, of course, .

is this: It doesn’t follow that what
is ‘good for Harvard or Penn
‘State is ‘good for Pitt, no more
‘than you‘ can say that your
friends ought to wear red because

YOU look good in it!
APitt has its own individual per-
sonality, and there’s no point in

obscuring it with useless notions
copied from other ‘schools. Last

'year this university received .a

lot of publicity in the newspapers

because of its work in medicine. '

These ‘advances, "like" everything
else worthwhile, were a result of

individualistic enterprise, n o t "

blind imitation. L
Emphasize Personality

Similarly, -why don’t we em-
phasize the personality of Pitt as
a personality different from those
of other institutions? Our build-
ings are_unique and we ought to
emphasize ‘this fact instead of
copying other campuses.

Our writing department -is one
of the best in the country, ’we'
have one of the most beautiful
chapels anywhere, and decidedly
one of the most ‘magniﬁcent
school buildings’ in the world.

But in the frenzy to scramble on ~

to that bandwagon, we forget
about these things.

There is nothing objectionable
about adopting policies that will
suit our individual circumstances.
But if Harvard’s policies aren’t
the best for us, then to heck with
Harvard. Let’s formulate our
own ideas, based on our univer-
sity’s individual needs.

Prices To “ Lower Ears

to the local barber dwelling and ’

therefore this style was the rage.
Shaved Cranium‘

For the more conservative, the
Roman, probably oneeof Caesar’s
creations, was preferred. It con-
sisted of most of the craniurn be-
ing shaved except for a narrow
band which circled (or squared
whichever the case may be) the
head. This type of cut served as
a sort of a ledge for the oft worn
olive branches of the times.

The third and most reﬁned was
the Celtic (not to be confused

with ‘the Boston Celtics) which -

enabled one to express his views
without opening’ his mouth. -It
was the favorite of the tonsors of
the day because they didn’t need
1; h e i r cumbersome measuring
sticks for exactness. It was just
a matter of taking a weight from
one’s head as the hair was clipped
from the. forehead to. the ears,

 

 

McCarthy of Era
Some eight centuries and mil-
lions of barbers later, Figaro, the

-Perry Como of the opera, stuck

his nose into the scene. By this
time the ordinary hair cutter _was

‘ missing from the stage for'he had

evolved into a surgeon, dentist
and barber allrolled into one.
Undoubtably if I the surgeonic

.business was slow his hair cus-

tomers suffered.‘ Thus he acted
as the McCarthy of the era bring-
ing out the “Red” in his custom-
ers.

Even though heheld three po-

' sitions, the Barber of Seville was

born 200 years too soon to clean
up on present day prices. The

barbers, on the other hand, when

are “in the gold,” as it were may
have a method in raising their
prices. They ﬁgure they. must
make some proﬁt before the ﬁeld
becomes overcrowded this ’June
due "to the number of.Tech gradu-
ates. ‘

Krasna, who also authored the

Once there was a Professor who was
reluctant to Flunk the Team's Top

Printwhistle, of impressive Physical
Proportions but intellectually a Lump.
The Professor sought a Loophole.
“Printwhistle,” he said, “I am ‘no
pedant who believes that the sole pur-
pose of education is to cram the Mind
with Facts. Rather is its aim to broaden
the Mind and make it more Productive.
If you can come to me within 24 hours
with one—— just one—origina1 and
worthwhile Idea, I shall ‘not Flunk
'you.”

— The dejected Prinlwhislle explained
his Dilemma to his roommate. “Relax,”
said the latter. “Simplest thing in the

Olsonmen F ace Test

In Triang

ular Meet

By PAUL HARRISON -

Come tomorrow, Pitt’s harrier strength will face its ﬁrst
‘major test in a triangular meet with Columbia and Rutgers
on the Van Courtland Park course in New York.

Although the Panther record for the year is four out of
four, all of the meets were considered aswarm-up runs in
preparation for the four strong eastern teams which are
just over the horizon on the schedule.

Put suc h annually tough
teams_ as Army and Villa-
nova along with Columbia and
Rutgers in a line-up and watch
any cross-country coach turn
green. Well, Coach Carl Olson
isn’t green but it can _be said a

eline ofworry‘ might have creas-
ed his brow from time to time
because of the powerhouses. ,

In tomorrow’s three-ringer, C5-
course for the ﬁrst time this year.

Steer’s captain-e1ec"t Rodger Four-
acre and returning letterman Bill

enjoyed a 5-1 record with the
Panthers giving them their only
taste of defeat. ' '

Olson smiled broadly Wednes-

ed the Rockets from Slippery
Rock, 15-50, for their ﬁfth straight

Don Del1iGatti, Don Sallade,
Grundy Gunderson, Walt Starz
and "Bob Cherry whipped
through their paces on the
Rockets’ home grounds, with all
ﬁve tieing for first in the time
of 23:0.5 Pete Kress, the ram-
bler of the squad, whizzed in
ten sceonds later and Dave Freas
completed the whitewash by
ﬁnishing seventh at 23:35. Don
Gill, of the Rockets, came in
from the wilderness a. minute
and 25 seconds after Freas.

" Out of the ﬁrst four meets, ﬁve

men were tied for the top spot in
three of them, and in the other,
four men whisked in at the same
time. With these showings no in-
dividual star can be pinpointed
and that is just the way Olson
likes it. As he says, “After all,
cross-couﬁtry, is a team sport and
the better the boys work together
the more meets we’ll win.”

Booters Hoping
For First Win

Despite Tuesday’s.5-0 loss to

Grove City, the Pitt soccer squad’

holds high hopes of making A1-
legheny their ﬁrst victim of the
season when they meet next Wed-
nesday. I ' _ "-
The score of the Grove City en-
counter was not indicative of the
action in the game, according to
Leo Bemis, advisor to the team.

“They didn’t get their ﬁrst goal‘

until the third quarter,” he re-
ported. “Their outﬁt just kept
plugging until we ran out of gas.”

Three of .the enemy goals were
scored on corner kicks, which are
made mostly by pure chance, but
the other two tallies came on
clean shots.

The Pitt booters tied Indiana in
their ﬁrst game, 1-1, and Wednes-
day will ‘face a team about the
same strength of Grove City.

IM Roundup

Lams Ro ck

By LYNN WATSON

Using the now disbanded two-.
platoon system of_collegiate foot-
ball, Pi Lambda Phi won an im-
pressive 24-O decision over Phi
Kappa at the Schenley Oval.

Marked by some vicious block-
ing on the part of both teams, the
"opening period found the Pi Lams
scoring when Sonny Gelman took

and tossed a southpaw pass which
end Hank Browdy grabbed for the
initial six points. ’

Paced by Herb Myers, the Pi
Lams ran thehalftime score to
18-0 by scoring twice in the sec-
ond period. Apparently trapped as
he faded to pass, Myers ran
around his right end to score un-
molested. Later in the period he’

passed 15 yards to Hohenstein for .

V another touchdown.

Early in the third period Hohen-
stein caught a pass from Gelman
to put the pi’s_ in—a comfortable
lead.

In the ﬁnal period the Pi Lams
used experimental plays to sharp-
en their offensive attack for fu-
ture opponents. Phi Kappa’s deep-
est penetration fell short of pay-
dirt in the ﬁnal _minutes of the
game as the scoreboard registered
a 24-0 win for Pi Lambda.Phi.

Phi Delta Theta’s passing at-
tack proved too much for the boys
from Sigma Chi at Schenley Oval
on Tuesday, as the combination of
Shanafelt to Hammerstein clicked

The Phi Delts took the opening

ﬁve plays, Shanafelt connecting
with Hammerstein for the touch-
down. Shannon’s aerial to Emery
tacked on the extra point. Seconds
later, an interecepted Sigma Chi
pass set up another score, with
Hammerstein grabbing a Shana-
felt pass in the end zone.

Underolcgs Lure Sellout
Against Vengeful Host ,

By DAVE MAZER
Tomorrow’s crowd of 56,000 expected for the Pitt-Notre
Dame clash will bring the ﬁrst sellout in Panther history at

South Bend, but Coach Red Dawson’s eleven isn’t looking
for a ﬁrst-—they’re after a repeat performance.

The‘Panthers, a 19-point underdog, will be seeking their A

second straight. over the Frank .Leahy squad as_ the Irish

open their home schedule.

Dawson’s comment on the odds
was, “Balance their seniors, jun-
iors, and sophomores with‘ ours,
and you’ll see that those point-
making fellows do prettyiwell.”

‘ Irish Have Edge

Ranked the country’s top team,
Notre Dame will be out for re-
venge after last year’s 22-19 Pan-
ther triumph which dropped the
Fighting Irish from a similar high
standing.

It will be the 21st gridiron con-
test between the intersectional
foes and the South Benders_have
the advantage in the 'all—time ser-
ies with 13 victories against six
losses and one tie.

N otre Dame enters the tilt Well-
rested and in good physical shape
since they didn’t play last week-
end. In their initial encounters,
the Irish downed Oklahoma 28-21,
and Purdue, 37-7.

Rockne Honored ~

Dawson’s boys, while not in the
best. condition with tackle Lou
Palatella and guard Rudy Grun-
der,out, will have the added in-
centive of trying to upset the Irish
on their Hall of Fame day.

Three all-time Notre Dame
greats, Knute Rockne, George
Gipp, and Elmer Layden will be
honored on their selection to the

\National Football Hall of Fame

at Rutgers University.

The Panther lineup will have
sophomore John Cenci of Schen‘-
ley in Grunder’s‘ place while Bill

Cessar from Millval.e seems to

have won Palate1la’s tackle spot.
Hoffman to Halfback
Other changes this week found
Bill Hoffman moving back to his
old halfback post after an unsuc-
cessful ﬂing at quarterback.

The switch doesn’t mean that

‘the blond Greensburger will start

tomorrow, but that Dawson will

use only Henry Ford, ‘Pete Neft,

Q
T

 

  

Caesar
and Rudy Mattioli at QB the re-
mainder of the season.‘

As for Notre Dame’s backﬁeld,
they’l1v ﬁeld a veteran‘ outﬁt with
All-American halfback Johnny
Lattner, quarterback Ralph Gug-
lielmi, full back Neil Worden. and
halfback Joe Heap. . ‘

Along the line,» Captain Don
Penza and his running mate at
end, Dan Shannon, head a rugged
array that includes such stalwarts
as tackle Frank Varrichione and
guard Menil Mavraides. .

Swamis Stick

Necks Out Too
Far This Time

SOUTH BEND, 1nd,, Oct. 16
(ACP)--Three Pitt students
were nabbed today as they en-
tered this Indiana city and
W ere promptly jailed on
charges of vagran_cy, disorder-
ly conduct, possessing A pool
sheets, impersonating newspa-
permen, and rooting for‘Pitt.

As they sought to identify
themselves as, Pittsburghers
named Kovar, Mazer, and
Franke, the local constabulary
took a look at their _ID card
pictures and tacked on. another
charge-—impersona.ting human
,beings.'_ . _' _\

However, the loathsome trio
ﬁnally established themselves
as Pitt News Yogis.

A gallows is already under
construction. -

As the gay, beer—drenched
swamis were clapped into
irons, they piped, “Here is a
clue—-we pick Pitt and Kala-
mazoo.”

all the stops in their attack.
_-"Although the undefeated Irish
meet Georgia_Tech next Saturday,
Leahy passed up a chance to
scout them and sat in on the Pitt-

Nebraska proceedings last week.
It is generally conceded that he
didn’t see much detail in Pitt’s at-

, tack, and he probably. returned
Ahome’ with a" picture of Eldred

‘ Kraemer continually chasing the
Nebraska passers and Red Daw-
"son.’s backs pounding holes through
the line at the opening and clos-
ing moments of the game.

Leahy, however, is sure to_ cook
up something in theway of an un-
pleasant reception for .the invad-
ers; he has to beat Pitt to keep the
-Irish on top. in the national rat-
ings. One loss would oust them in
favor of Michigan State.

Observers who rate Pitt a good
chance to cop another-upset point
to a comparison on the two teams’
common’ foe--Oklahoma.

The Sooners racked up three.
touchdowns against . the South
Benders while losing the game 28-
21, on a couple of breaks. Pitt-held
Oklahoma to a 7-7 tie. If only
such comparisons worked out even
half the time!

this teamwork doesn’t end with re-
