The debating teams of the Univer-

contests which took placexwith ‘West

 

The men's team of the University of
Pittsburgh, represented by,Ben David-
son, Russell Stahlman and Paul Reed,
met the Vvest Virginia team in the
auditorium of the Schenley High
school and the girls’ team, accom-
panied by Dean Thyrsa. Amos, as
chaperon and Charlotte Ball, as mana-
ger, met the opposing.girls’ team in
Morgantown.

Friday’s affair was the ﬁrst time
that the Pittdebaters have tasted de-
feat this season, having won a unani-
mous decision over the George Wash-
ington University
been victorious in the other events,
which have been held during the pres-
ent season. ) I’

The Girls’ Glee Club of the Univer-
sity of.Pittsbu_rghv furnished the music
for the.occasion_ ,

The question used for the debate
was as follows: “Resolved, That the
principle of the closed shop with open
union be established in American in-
This is the same question
which has been successfully debated
in the -other contests which have been
held.

Owing to the inability of Chancellor
McCormick to preside, Dr. C. C. Hers-
man,‘a. Pitt alumnus, presided over the
-meeting. The judges, who presented
a two-to-o, e decision‘ in favor of the
‘.1./ginia. team, are as follows:
. ,_:.'B. Davis‘, W. C. Lyre and
James A, Wakeﬁeld,

The girls, who took the- trip to
Morgantown, received a. similar de-
cision in their contest, in which they
‘upheld the negative side of the same
question. . The judges. in this‘ event
were: L. S.‘Schwenk, Michigan; W.
H. Cooper, Ohio University, and C. R.
Lowt-her of Morgantown.

Two additional contests have been
arranged’ by the management" of the

  

-team. the first to be with the girls’

team of _ Westminster and» the other
with the mebfs team of‘ the’. University

  III SALE  

Pitt pins are still on sale. It’s not
too late'to get yours, but the Student
Senate says you’ll have to hurry. And
they bought to know. They have man-
aged the affair right along, and they
admit (with blushing modesty) that
they have made  pretty good job of it.
In fa.ct they have disposed of—~well, a

 

' gcod1y‘number——ofﬁcial ﬁgures are not

yet ready for publication. But the
deans of the respective schools who,
along with the authorities of the Uni-
versity, engmzgered this entire scheme,
are now going to throw their hats into
the ring, and just “watch the fur ﬂy.”
If the Student Senate made a good job
of. it, the deans will make it better.
-For the deans, after due and deliber-
ate consideration, have reached the
weighty decision to assume charge of
the sale of these self-same pins. That
Mr. and Miss Average Pittite are not
ashamed to exhibit ‘their University
affiliations, is evidenced by the promi-
nent display of these pins,

“What is the purpose of these pins?”
is aques-tion ﬂung about considerably
around the campus. In the words of
Senate leaders, it is above all to pro-
mote a spirit of good fellowship among
the students, and to let the world know
that Pittites cherish the distinction of
being such, and are willing to be set.
back the amount of four hits, to im-
part that glad fact. The colors are
very appropriate. Green, ‘for the
Freshmen, is of course, made to order.
The Sophomores are tagged with red
pins, which is the ‘color a Freshman
sees generally when espying a Sopho-
more. Blue for the Juniors; gold for
the un-
classiﬁed and pure white for the
faculty are the tints by which you may
discern their standing. “Is there any
money in it?" is the insinuating query.
put by some Doubting Thomases.
Senators, when interviewed, vehe-
mently denied that these was any
proﬂteering going on with these pins.
and claimed that the m='. proceeds will

. be negligible—and the “Senators are

honorable men."

This is “Tim/f former Graduate
Manager of Athletics, present Chair-
fman of Alumni Council and a 100-pen
cent Pitt man‘ in every respect. f‘Tim”
prepared for the University at Beaver
College’ and received his A.-B. degree
at, Pitt in 1902 and his Idegreevof
bachelor of laws in 1905. As a stu-
dent he was active- in school and
class athletics, playing guard on the
basket ball team a number of years
and served" as pitcher and captain of
his class baseball team in the days
when no varsity team was maintain-
ed on the diamond. Soon after gradua-
tioh, “Tim” was taken into", member-
ship in the Phi Gamma. Delta: frater-
nity in recognition of his services to
the, University as an undergraduate
‘student.’ ‘

It is‘ as an alumnus that “'l“im”'ha's
shone. Since 1910, the date of the*or-_
ganizationt of the Athletic Council,
“Tim” has been a member of that
body and a .leading spirit in all" its
policies. In addition to his athletic
interests,’ “Tim” has found time to
give 4 attention ‘to the general
alumni in‘teres't‘s F of the University
and he, with Garﬁeld Houston, drew
up the constitution which at present
governs the University‘ Alumni Asso-
ciation.

It is scarcely possible to think of
the Alumni’ Building Campaign with-
out -thinking of “Tim" Hurst. Day

§“.Tim” was on the job for whatever
work was to be done. During the ac-
tive campaign he was available for
call any minute and practically de-
voted the entire two weeks exclusively
to the campaign_. During that time his
oiﬁce door at 1513 Berger Building
could very well have displayed the’
sign .“Back in Two Weeks.” As
chairman of Alumni Council many of
the most burdensome duties of the
-ﬁnancial drive fell upon “Tim” and,
