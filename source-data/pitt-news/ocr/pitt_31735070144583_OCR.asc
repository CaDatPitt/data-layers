‘Deep Throat‘ star
looks back at Pitt

by Jen Hirsch
Sfaﬁ" W7riter

_ It didn’t take long for Herb Streicher to go
from a Pitt dropout who wasn’t so hot with the
ladies to a legendary porn star

Better known as Harry Reems, the New
York native starred in the 1972 ﬁlm, “Deep
Throat,” which later became the pseudonym of
The Washington Post’s informant who exposed
the Watergate scandal.

Before becoming famous for his role as
the very hands—on Dr. Young, Reems thought
“school was h ”

So, he left Pitt after less than one semester —
although there is no longer record of him attend-
ing— to join the Marine Corps

“I had watched too many John

The advice he got: “Go shoot a sex ﬁlm.”

However, young Streicher was no Ron jer-
emy or Peter North at the time.

‘My sexual life prior to all this was almost
non—existent,”‘ he said “I didn’t have sex ’til I
was well out of high school  I was scared of
women.” c

When he arrived at the audition, Reems
was asked to have sex simultaneously with two
women.

“It seemed to be the two gals enjoyed work-
ing with me I wasn’t a rodent, and I wasn’t abu-
sive in any way,” he said. .

Reems explained that the women chose their
male counterparts

. “My name got out there as fast as lightning,”

' But,  $72~per week was not enough to
pay the rent, he said.
“One of the other actors in the group said,
‘I know where you can make 100 bucks in one
hour,”’ said Reems

  
    

He agreed and went on to star in
what might be the highest grossing pornographic
movie of all time, said Reems I
“Deep Throat” was different than many

studies at Pitt; , - ’

It was a landmark of the sexual revolution

Editor ’sNote: The students ’names
in this story have been changed to en-
courage open discussion.

Most sexually active students at Pitr
are satisﬁedwithabeclwlienhavingsex
Maybe even a couch or table

But for an uncharted group of stu-
dents, those options are just too safe —
many students are opting to add a sense
ofdangertotheirintimacyintheform
of sex in public places And theyfre places

From the Cathedral of 
to Hillman Library and the communal
rooms of everydorm, students getdown

“The anticipation of  caught

Junior Sally mirrored James’ senti-
ments

“It’s different, and that causes curios-

do something risky or dangerous—to
beabadass,”shesaid.

To some students, James included,
sexinpublicis sometimes seenas ane-
cessity—when theurge st:t:ikes and a
private room just isn’t available But most
often, aocordingto Mary Ruiz, the Ofﬁce
of Sexual Assault Services coordinator,
students crave the thrill of doing a for-
bidden act. And though we may never
outgrow that desire, the mannerinwhich
we carry it out wﬂl change

“I would guess thatit’s an age issue
As people get older, the thrill for them
is affairs This is  around in a

get caught, and the whole issue of doing
something forbidden,” said Ruiz.

Another factor, Ruiz said, is college
students’ penchant for  and
questionable decisions

“\X/hen people dtink, their inhibi-
tions are lowered So you take alcohol
and combine with doing something for
the thrill of it — that’s why it’s happen-
ing,’ ’ she said

Of course public sex is fun and
games until students get caught. Then it
becomes a matter dealt with by people
most students wouldn’t want sorting
through theirintimatelives——thePitt
police

As there is no code  deal-
ing with public sex in the Pitt student
oode of conduct, students caught in
the act in a public place would be dealt
withlike anyone else accused of indecent

exposure, said Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey. .

If a student is caught by any Univer-
sity staﬁ‘, the information can be passed
to campus police and land the studmt
at ajudicial Board heating. Still, there is
no blanket punishment for sex in public

Joe is a Pitt freshman who's looking for
love — online. He joined free dating Web
site OkCupid.com in 2005 at the age of 16.

“My main purpose for joining when I
was 16 was not for dating at all, because Ok-
Cupid has a ton of tests, and I really enjoy
taking online tests,” said Joe. “I think they
are a lot of fun and most of the time very
hilarious. Back then I didn’t meet a lot of
people because I wasn’t looking to meet
people.”

Between dorms, classes, clubs, dining
halls, sporting events, bars and parties, some
Pitt students still ﬁnd it difficult to make con-
nections’ with their peers. So, they’re turning
to online dating services to ﬁnd friendship, a
date or even a lasting love.

Joe said that now that he is in college,
he has been more active in connecting with
others through the Web site.

“I have gotten a couple of messages‘
from other people on the site. Some are
from Pittsburgh and others are from jack-
sonville, Fla, where I live,” said Joe.

He said he met a student from Chatham,
whom he hangs out with on occasion, but,
“We are just friends, mainly because she is
a senior.” A

Joe said that he isn’t counting on meet- '

ing too many. people through‘ OkCupid.
However, he isn’t opposed to meeting more .
people from the Web site in person, since it
turned out well the first time.

Although he uses the ‘Web site to find’ '

friends and dates, Joe admitted that he has
occasionally seen people he knows on the
Web site and has “subsequentlyjmade fun
of them for it.”

Joe is only one of a few of the 150,000-
200,000 people who log into OkCupid on a
daily basis, according to Eli Gwynn, a pro-
grammer for OkCupid. Of the 5,000 people
who sign up for OkCupid in a given day,
approximately 1,500 are college—aged, said
Gwynn, although he’s not sure how many
are enrolled in college.

“Gone are the days of being paranoid
that everyone you meet on the Internet is
going to be some sort of social outcast, re-
cluse, serial murderer or rapist,” said Gw-
ynn.

College students are turning to dating
Web sites, especially OkCupid, because it is
“easy, safe and cheap,” he said.

“Economic times are rough and fewer
people have the money to go to a bar or to
throw a party ... You go online, you browse
around, you chat, you ﬂirt, whatever. If you
don’t like it, you leave.”

While ]oe has sought pleasure in taking
quizzes on the site and has found some hu-
mor in his membership, Dimitri, a 21-year-
old Pitt junior said he joined several online

dating services because his “normal method V

of meeting girls was not getting ... results.”
Dimitri said he joined OkCupid during
winter break, because he and his friend were

V having bad luck meeting girls in Pittsburgh.

“We decided it would be worth our time
to check out the online dating scene,” said
Dimitri. “Although I have yet to go out on a
date or meet anyone, for that matter.”

His friend, he said, “hasn’t had any luck
yet either, as far as I know. He has sent mes-

boyfriend for two years

Wu, who met her boyfriend in
Hong Kong through his father who
is a regular customer at the Starbucks
where she works, said there are habits
thatshe disagrees  .

“They need to focus on their stud-
ies They shouldn’t get drunk and do
something crazy,” said Wu, who ada-
mantiy criticizes the role alcohol plays in
American dating culture

Penelope Morrison, a doctoral can-
didate in the department of anthropol-
ogy, said she thinks ambiguous terms
assogiated with American dating can
also contribute to foreign perceptions
of American dating

“It seems that nowadays young
people prefer to date multiple persons
at the same time or the same person
for very short  of time, like say
for one to three dates,” said Morrison
“There seems to be a lot more em-
phasis on ‘hooking up’ and romantic
encounters aren’t necessarily viewed as
‘leading somewhere”

The inclination to be attracmd to
certain people from different countries
over others, is what Morrison says is, the
“exotiﬁcation of the other”

 

from page 6

“What is foreign or different often
seems exotic or  — even “ta-
boo” % and therefore, desirable to us,”
said Morrison. I

“I think that if you look cross—cul—
turallyf ’ said Morrison, ‘you will ﬁnd
that almost every culture has an “other ’
that they ﬁnd attractive — for us it may
be British accents, for people in Eng-

land, it may be French accents — the '

point is that constructions of desirabil-
ity and attractiveness are deeply ernbed—
dedineachculture’s history,aswellas
values, norms and context.”

Ali Alanazi, a Muslim ﬁom Saudi
Arabia, believes everyone should be-

come more knowledgeable about dif- _

ferent cultures and customs

“Datingis a sininmycountry,” said
Alanazi, who met his wife two times
prior to  her. “It is forbidden
to follow the West A

, “Wemarryagiriwe’ve never seen.”

Alanazi, who nowlives in Pittsburgh
withhis wife and two children, admits
to celebrating Valentines day in the
Uniwd States,,something looked down

Dimitri said that while he and his friend

people do is answer a copious amount of
questions as a type of investment of time
and surprise them with a subscription fee
after they ﬁnish,” he said.

Overall, Dimitri said he hasn’t had any
success through the Web sites so far.

“I usually get ignored completely, and I’d
like to know why, but I never asked because
I always assumed they would simply ignore
me once again,” he said.

According to his OkCupid proﬁle, he is a
“genuinely nice guy, but people tend to take
advantage of that.”

However, Dimitri hasn’t become dis-
couraged enough to quit using any of the
Web sites.

Unlike Dimitri, Sebastian said he is will-
ing to pay for sites like Match.com. He is also
a member of Plenty of Fish and OKCupid
and is thinking about joining E-Harmony.

* Sebastian, a graduate student at Pitt
studying biomedical informatics, said he
“doesn’t really meet girls because  pro-
gram is mostly guys.”

So far, Sebastian said he has met a few
girls locally, “but nothing has come of it
yet.”

While Joe, Dimitri and Sebastian
haven’t found success yet, Melissa, a Pitt se—
nior, has had better luck.

She has been dating her ﬁance
Brad since she met him on OkCupid in_]uly
2006.

Like Joe, Melissa said she joined the site

because she loved taking tests. She wasn’t

expecting to ﬁnd love. -

“My proﬁle said that I didn’t want to re-
ceive messages, and Brad sent me a message
saying I needed a night out,” said Melissa.

She replied to his message because “I
think mean people are intriguing.”

Melissa and Brad had met by the end of
the next week. They’ve been inseparable
ever since.

“We tell everyone we met at the library,”
said Melissa. “It’s more interesting and sweet
than saying we met on]ine.”

Five simple reasons to get  

yourself tested

Sex is pretty great. It feels

; good, it gets your heart rate up,
 and if you have thin walls, then

 it’s an excellent way to get back

at your roommate for not doing

 the dishes. But like any activity,

being sexually active carries risks
that people need to realize. And

 while most people know. about

pregnancy already, and straight-
up relationship drama is kind of
tough to avoid, there is one thing
that can be easily prevented: sexu-
ally transmitted infections.

STIS are easy to test for, and
doctors and clinics almost always
offer options to be tested. But not
everyone is convinced that test-
ing is necessary, so we compiled

I a list of pros and cons to help

you make up your  First, the
positive aspects of getting an STI

‘ test.

1. It’s good for you and your
partner. This ﬁrst reason is prob-

i ably the most obvious, but it

deserves to be said. Just like you
get a ﬂu shot in ﬂu season or a
tetanus booster when you stick
yourself with a rusty. nail, people
should get tested for STIS when
they’re sexually active. Even if
neither partner has a history of
infection, it’s simply a good idea
to safeguard your own health.

2. It’s not painful or awkward.

 Well, OK, maybe it’s a little awk-
ward the ﬁrst time you do it, at

least if you’re shy. But if you’re
willing to get naked in front of
another person and exchange
body ﬂuids, you shouldn’t feel

., that weird about letting a trained

medical professional evaluate your
health. And all it really involves is
a cotton swab and a quick blood
.test. No muss, no fuss.

3. It shows you care. They say

136218011 I101: to.

nothing says you care like ﬂowers
or chocolates or whatever, but
getting tested on behalf of some-
one else’s heath is about as nice a
thing as you can possibly do for
another person. If you want to
prove that you’re a good person
and want to prove that you’re not
passing along a Variety of nasty
infections, this is a pretty good
way to go about it.

4. It won’t cost you anything
but your time. Student Health of-

“ fers students two free tests per

year. If you’ve paid your Student
Health fee, you’re already paying
for the service, so you might as
well take advantage of it. Think
about it: For a free appointment,
you’re gaining a clean bill of

' health, some personal peace of

mind and the ability to tell your
partner that you’re free and clear.
But all you have to lose is a little
bit of free time -— and it would
really be a shame to miss’ that
“House” rerun, wouldn’t it?

5. It enables you to make bet-
ter choices. Knowing your sexual
health status means that you can

‘make informed decisions about

your sex life, simple as that. If
you come up positive, it’s always
better to know and get treatment,

as well as change the way you go_

about your game so that you can

avoid it in the future. Like G.I. Joe

always said, knowing is half the
battle."

We also felt that we should
provide skeptics with reasons why

, they might want to avoid getting

tested, just in case. '

 Actually, we ,couldn’t think
of any. Sorry about that —- may-
be you should make an.appoint—
ment now. After all, you’ve got no

Take awalk on the
casual side of Craigslist

 

by Braque
Hershberger
/I/Ia/zagizzg E3£tor

Everybody has one’.
Whether it’s a kink, a fetish

or an all-out deviation from the

norm, ‘ everybody has I something _

weird that makes them tick sexu-
ally-

’ i While it’s often not something
easily shared with a committed-

partner, Web sites like Craigslist.
org’s Casual Encounters provide
an outlet for people to pursue their

- strangest fantasies.

The Casual Encounters sec-
tion of Craigslist allows users to
post free, uncensored sex person-
als anonymously: It’s no surprise
that these posts regularly show
up in the “Best of Craigslist” lists,
as the listings are often hilarious
to browse. But for users actually
looking to fulﬁll their sexual fan-
tasies, the listings promise much
more. . i i

The online sex personals list-
ings cater to any and all lifestyles,

and the Pittsburgh board is alive.

with activity every day.

In a nutshell, however, the same
laws of nature that govern a Satur-
day night in Oakland still apply on
Casual Encounters. And while the
anonymity of the Web site is ini-
tially liberating, it only goes so far.

Perhaps you’relike one recent
poster, who was in the. market
for some action with a pregnant
woman. . _

Of course, your week might be
ﬁlling up too quickly as it is. But no
matter what your persuasion is, the
opportunity’s there.

VVhat's most enticing about
Casual Encounters, besides

anonymity of the operation.

What’s most enticin about
g .

Casual Encounters, besides those
hugs and kisses, is theanonymity
of the operation. Theoretically, a
user can ﬁnd a willing partner, set
up a date and partake in an out-
rageous fantasy without sharing
anything _personal about him or
herself. . . C .

But like most things that sound
too good to be true, Casual En-
counters isn’t that simple. After
trying out the Web site for myself
for academic reasons, it became
clear that the Web site worksbet—
ter for some than others.

When I posted as a straight

male —' or a, “m4w,” swinger-
speak for “man looking for wom-

an,” I found my posts quickly bur-
ied among a mountain of others,
usually before receiving a single
response. But posting as a straight

Or apply to be a columnist at

female —‘a “w4m” — I attracted a
good number of responders who,
in some cases, were even kind
enough to include well-composed

photos of their penises. It’s impor— —

tant to put your best foot forward
in this type of situation.
My posts in the gay sections --

i“m4m” and “w4w” — were actu-

ally some of my most successful in
terms of response quantity. Craig-

.slist’s anonymity makes it a natu-

ral ﬁt for people whose tastes and
preferences aren’t widely accepted.
If nothing else, Casual Encounters
is at least a refreshing reminder of
the sexual diversity that surrounds
us. '

In any event, somewhere be-
tween the posting of an ad and
its consummation, logistics dictate
that users are willing to sacriﬁce
personal details about themselves,
like phone numbers, names and
addresses. The ads that get the
most views and responses, for ex-
ample, include personal pictures
of the poster. _

Also, communication on the
site happens through e—mail, and
your name is attached to your e-

mail account. If you try to take the"

route of using a fake name and
e—ma.il address, you risk coming
off as suspicious, which is a major
turn-off.

I give kudos to those who are
willing to put themselves out there
and, broadcast some information
about their sex lives to the world.
Their sex lives are undoubtedly
better for it. i _

But for most of us, Casual En-
counters is a’ conversationpiece
and a window into a world most
of _us wouldn’t dare venture into.

times. _

On the fourth try, the yel-

my code: 1374, the year of the
great dancing mania of Aix-la-
Chapelle.

I turn the handle to enter my
dorm room, but instead of a
clear entrance, I bang my head on
the door. My roommate is push—_
ing back ﬁercely against the other
side. *

“WAIT!”

“Better not be masturbating!”
I shout. But it’s worse. I hear the
honks and squeals of a semi-con-
scious, topless, bottomless girl
through the hollow walls.

I miss the old days, when I
caught him Googling porn while
cuddling his He-Man action _ﬁg-
ure in one hand and a bottle of
Astro—Glide in the other.

   

 

Bravo, my boy,_ you’ve got a

mically undulating on my desk all
over my Pink Floyd CD5, crack-

knows what —— though I can take
a guess — on David Gilmour’s
face, I am sexiled.

From the Latin “sexilus,”
meaning “to plow the field,” and
the Old English exile, “to get the
f*** out,” in modern terminol-
ogy “sexile” is when a roommate
does the horizontal mambo a
foot away from one’s Xbox.

A sexile is understandable. In .

high school, the back seat of the
Dodge Neon parked at the cem-
etery or in front of the Wal—Mart
was suitable, and the neighbors
wouldn’t_: ‘watch you from your
room. Or so you thought.

In college, though, the Uni-
versity gives students a cozy two-
by-four Stucco enclave with lav-
ish bulletin board decor. Instead
of each college student receiving
his own one of these “rooms,” he
has to share- the concrete dwell-

mg.

 

So now I’m standing in the
hallway with time to kill. .

The most logical action would
be to trek to the ol’ ladyfriend’s
abode and awkwardly cuddle
her. Oh, wait. I don’t have a girl-

A 1 Steve Garﬁnhel/StaiffPhotographer

 

  

     

  

So, what did you get for Christ-
mas this year? I got a wife.

_ Excited as I always am to tell
people about this, they typically re-
spond as though I’d just told them
I have a terminal illness.

“Oh no,” they might say. “But
you’re so young.” .

People often ask me why I’d
want to get married at this age —-
but then, why do people get mar-
ried at any age?

In a sense, those who question
my decision are justified. Almost.
Life isn’t a race, and you don’t get
extra points for reaching its mile-
stones before anyone else. But the
biggest flaw to that metaphor isn’t
the speed, it’s the racetrack —— af-

        

ter all, life’s hurdles aren’t in the
same position for every runner on
the track. '

True, many young people are
more in love with the idea of
marriage than the institution it-
self —-— watch a few episodes of
“Engaged and ,Underage” and
you’ll understand.  your
life’s partner _—-— should you even
subscribe to the belief that you’re

' ’meant to have one — is an ardu-

ous task for many, and it would
be a major relief _ to get it over
with early so you can get on with
your life already. For that reason, I
consider myself very fortunate to
have found so early the person I
love, my best friend, the woman I
want to one ‘day bear my children

and shovel Jell-O into my gummy,

toothless mouth.

But as appealing as the concept
of marriage and lifelong compan-
ionship might be, it isn’t a decision

to make lightly. Getting married
is not the next logical step for
your relationship after moving in
together, or after being a couple
for any. certain number of years.
Depending on your relationship, it
could scarcely be a step at all, as
much as it’s a statement. i

“

Married or not, wed spend
our lives together —— the

wedding only made it ofﬁcial'._

3;?

My wife and I" met when we

were 16 years old, and almost irn- '

mediately we each knew that the
other was irreplaceable. After
freshman year we moved in to-
gether and merged our bank ac-.

rri9eisrea"'| abobnshawv

counts, and shortly thereafter we 

were engaged. After spending two
and a half years attempting to plan
(and more importantly, finance) ‘a
wedding, we ﬁnally eloped in De-
cember and were married in front
of a lone witness and a photogra-
pher. .
And really, that was that. Noth-
ing changed but her last name and.
our tax status. Which brings us
back to the original question I so
often hear: “Why would you want
to get married so young?” '
Marriage is a statement, not a
“next step” for a relationship. My
wife and -I, both 22‘ years old, have
spent more than a fourth of our
lives together, but we didn’t get
married out of any sense of ob-
ligation to each other. Married or
not, we’d spend our lives together
— the wedding only made it of-
ﬁcial, and I’m proud to announce
it every time I can call her my wife
insteadiof my girlfriend. '

Anyone can live a married life
without being married. Your rights
and your taxes change a little, and
if you’re a religious sort (unlike
myself), you can finally have all the
guilt-free sex you want. If you’re
in a relationship that merits mar-
riage — that is, a happy, stable,
loving one —_ very little is likely to
technically change.

What does change, or rather
the thing that makes marriage an
institution to which everyone" —
young, old, gay, straight, white,
black — deserves the irrevocable
right, is that you’ve made your
declaration of love and commit-
ment. '

And  times like . these, if -

you’ve found someone with whom
you can truly be happy, with whom
you can share life’s good and bad,
with whom you can grow and be
alive with — well then,iby God;
you deserve to declare yourself.

Everyone loves to dance. Some people just prefer to do it naked.
night to answer the question, what’s the best _
exotic clgb in Pittsburgh? After a long night of 6-inch heels, g-strings and dollar bills

Q’ stuffed into both men’s and women’s garters, we came to one conclusion —

it all depends on what you’re into,-baby. C

The A&E staﬂ set out last Saturday

72/3 C/C‘/Cfez‘ Lou/73¢

   

 

]ustin: Our stop at Shadyside's Cricket was both welcom-
ing and entertaining. The  ceilings erase the boxed-in feel
of Blush and make room for near—20-foot poles One dancer
climbed all the way up and slid down  upside-
down by only her legs Awesome. The vibe was extremely
laid back, and the dancers were approachable “I have the

‘second best job ever!” said one. \X/hat’s the first? “Being in
porn, duh!”

Kieran: Think of it as a Steelers’ bar meets Cirque du So-
leil meets  nude women. The atmosphere is welcom-
ing, and a feeling of camaraderie sweeps the gaping crowd.
One girl’s quickly discarded outﬁt reminded me of Santa
Claus, and she certainly came to town. Smoking is allowed
——_a big draw as chain—smoking and strip clubs complement
each other very well Drinks are not overly expensive, and the
female bartenders don’t even get mad when cheesy pick—up

ﬁlines  “Are YOU a dancer too?” are thrown their way. The
bathroom is a bit tiny, leading to some awkwardly proximate ‘
encounters with fellow patrons.

Braque: The Cricket offers plenty of tables and bar seats,

so there’s no pressure to sit right up at the stage as soon as

,._.you  in. The  were really friendly and conversational,

whichladded to the laid-back atmosphere. while being a ﬁJll-

on strip club, it manages to feel like _sorh_ething more along the

lines of a sports bar or pub.’ It’s well lit, so it doesn’t feel seedy
or suspicious, and the crowd is lighthearted.

.1, Margaret: America’s puritanical bent is no match for the
devil-may-care, second-generation feminism of the Cricket
Lounge. Lithe, acrobatic dancers smiled as theymade their
way around the oblong stage, checking in with regulars, chat-
ting to the men and women pushing dollar bills under their
garter belts. The guilty underpinnings that make “stripper”

«an unacceptable word at the dinner table have no place on
stage. The only neon to be found in the Cricket Lounge is
the 8-foot-high outline of a woman snapping a whip. All in
good fun. ' i .

Times have changed. No longer must
willing suitors travel to the family home
for an interrogation under bright lights by
a father with marksmanship awards posted
throughout the house. Instead, dating is
open to anyone who has the guts to ask.

Dating has been dernocratized. If you
are a girl you can ask, if you are a boy you
can ask. Sex doesn’t necessarily determine
who is in control anymore. As college stu-
dents, we can explore the sort of person-
alities that make us happy at Starbucks or
Hem’s or at that small Italian Bistro, Enri-
co’s on Ellsworth. Above all things, dating
is a damned good excuse to explore the city
with someone new.

Sarah \/Inski_/ Senior Staff Photographer

“Dating is a chance to get to know one
another, beyond the shallow settings that
we often find ourselves in,” said senior
Katie Vojtko. Finally, you have the chance
to talk about something other than the
weather or the latest party with someone
else. You can sit down at some hole—in-the-
wall bar and ﬁnd yourself telling stories of
your greatest antics and laughing with your
partner across the table. “It’s a chance to be
intimate,” said Vojtko.

Or at least that’s how some people see
it. A student of history and philosophy of
science, who asked to remain anonymous,
sees a date as “a time to get laid. I’m up-
front about it, and for me the success rate
is about 75 percent.”

Regardless of what you’re looking for,
Pittsburgh has some of the best places to

These days, top manufacturers like Tro- .

jan, Durex and LifeStyles put out tons of
condom varieties —— ribbed, studded, extra
lubricated, ultra pleasure, shared pleasure
and twisted pleasure, among others.

But is there actually any difference be—
tween brands?

I grabbed my partner and a handful of
condoms to find out if Trojan is better
than Durex, or if that extra ribbing makes
a difference. .

A few weeks ago while attending a saf-
er—sex workshop, I came across a condom
brand I’d never seen before. It’s called One,
and it’s advertised as “Next Generation
Condoms.” I snagged one of the free sam-

ples in the studded variety, and it deﬁnitely I

took first place as my condom of choice.
They come in round packages that feature
160 unique designs and are definitely more

- attractive than standard condom fare.

My only complaint is that it’s easier to
rip the condom with round packaging than
with square. As far as actual use goes, the
studs didn’t do anything for my partner,
and while I could feel them, they didn’t do
a whole lot for me either, but they were
kind of nice. The lubrication lasted much
longer than Trojan, Durex or LifeStyles.
Because of the extra lubrication, removal
can be a bit messier than with other con-
doms, but the extra lube helps cover up the
typical plastic condom feel.

I found another new brand at the same
workshop, this one claiming to restore the
pleasure lost by the inclusion of latex in
sex. Pleasure Plus condoms include an ex-
tra pouch of latex that theoretically stimu-

Now accepting most   iicsfarauce

 

lates the underside of the gems during sex.
My partner reported no such extra stimula-
tion and said it felt like any other condom.
It certainly didn’t have anything going on
for me. But even if the pleasure pouch is a
gimmick, the brand did  as far as_ lubri-
cation goes, and we edidn’t’E:r'ie1eed to use any
of our own to make up the slack.

After the new brands, my partner and
I moved on to the classics —— Trojan, Du-
rex and LifeStyles. I had basically the same
problems with all three ~—— the lubrication
wears off quickly, leaving you with that un-
comfortable, plastic—condom feeling. Add-
ing a touch of lubricant to both the inside
and outside of the condom can help allevi-

ate this problem, but for the purposes of

 

this review I chosenot to

which is lubricated with7:spermicide and

The Pitt News asked two of its star movie reviewers to sit through “Pirates: Stagnetti’s Revenge,” the most expensive porn ﬂick of all time at $8 million, a $55 million upgrade from

W the former t_itle—holder, “Pirates.” The series has risen above most porn ﬁlms in history —— a 2006 screening of the original at Carnegie Mellon and Yale universities completely sold

out. But in_the stiff competition of the porn industry, we wondered — is bigger necessarily better?

 and budget cuts, it’s nice to see
that the adult entertainment company Digital
Playground has the balls to throw caution to
the wind and produce what is touted as the
biggest and most expensive porn ﬂick in his-
tory. And whether you were a fan of the ﬁrst
film, or a “Pirates” virgin, you can be sure
that you’ll get at least a chuckle out of the
blockbuster production.

Even the porn industry is
selling out. -

“Pirates: Stagnetti’s Re»
venge” is the sequel to the
best—selling, award-winning pornographic
ﬁlm “Pirates.” Both are uncannily similar to
the non-porn “Pirates of the Caribbean” tril-
ogy, but this isn’t the ﬁrst time that porn has
borrowed from the big screen (see “Clock-
work Orgy,” “Dude, Where’s My Dildo?” and
the cult classic, “Spankenstein”).

But why “Stagnetti’s Revenge” and not
‘Whore of the Rings?” The pirate porn spoof
is advertised as the most expensive adult ﬁlm
ever produced with a whopping budget of $8
million. _

Too bad they didn’t just spend that money
‘on boob jobs. .

porn star version of Jack Sparrow, Captain
Stagnetti.

Surprisingly, certain characters are devel-
oped much more than in the average porn
ﬂick. Captain Edward obviously has some
sort of masculinity issue (“Bow before the
mighty sword of the greatest pirate hunter
that ever lived,” he proclaims to two ladies
before plunging into their depths).

But although “Stagnetti’s Revenge” has
advanced sometimes Freudian, main char-
acter development, it has no excuse for its
crude depictions of Asian people. When
asked what the evil Asian pirate captain Xie—
feng’s greatest weakness is, another pirate
shouts, “Chow meinl” Even worse, one of
the promiscuous female pirates declares, “I
ruv you Panda. You’re my best Ruverl” after a
20-minute bedroom rumpus.

When all’s said and done, only so much
storyline and hardcore pornography (11
scenes in total) can keep a person captivated.
Even with its masterful editing, after the sixth

sex scene about an hour and a half in, “Stag-
netti’s Revenge” just becomes boring.

The writers rely on two forces — generic
puns familiar of a sixth grader’s comedic style
and racist depictions that leave you feeling ex-
tremely uncomfortable. In between the hu-
mor and fornication‘, there seems to be some
sort of plot development, but it all ends up
being too lengthy and tedious, most notice-
ably in a 20-minute recollection by Captain
Edward practically summarizing the last
movie, without any ﬂashbacks or cut scenes

» whatsoever.

What porn needs isn’t “Scary Movie”-like
spooﬁng but erotic plot lines. Remember
l972’s “Deep Throat?” One of the most in-
famous pornos ever, “Deep Throat” centers
on a woman whose G-spot is deep in her
throat.

And while “Pirates” can ﬂash its shiny
awards and technical achievements, the only
thing that most people want to be ﬂashed is
its stars’ marnrnaries.

 

the Captain’s crew travels across the exotic
CGI ocean to once again destroy evil and
reach climax multiple times over the epic,
two—and—a—half—hour running time. ,

“Pirates,” obviously, is not your average
pornographic ﬁlm. The plot is more compli-
cated than many Adam Sandler movies.

Likewise, it’s also funnier than many
Adam Sandler movies. The dialogue is not
laughably bad (most of the time), and some-
times what could be construed as genuine
wit comes across in the script.

The effects are on par with most Sci—Fi
Channel Original Movie fare, but it is the
sets and the costumes that truly astound
— the pearl necklaces worn in the ﬁlm are
stunning. They make the erotic scenes seem
like integrated sequences in a larger story, as
opposed to being the basis that many ﬂimsy

For fun we decided to try Night

things that glow in the dark are
always fun. If ‘you’re in the mood

have to say that a condom is a

the most pleasure from your con-

have a good time, without having to take
out another loan. If you’re looking for a
date idea, here are some great suggestions
to take her or him out for a good time:

Pitt Arts: Let’s_ get real here, if your
wallet’s a little limp and you’re looking for a
good meal and a cultural event, Pitt Arts is
the way to go. Get dolled up and take him
or her out to the symphony. Usually, there’s
enough time to slip away to coffee after the
free meal and before the free concert.

De Luca’s, the Strip District: If
you’re looking into doing something a little
bit romantic that involves spending the day
together, head down to the Strip District
for the amazing breakfast burritos over at
De Luca’s. Pass on De Luca’s coffee, and as
you walk down 21st street, hit up La Prima
Espresso Co., for a biscotti and a cappuc-
cino. Impresshim or her with a great at-
mosphere to sit and talk and then take her
out to Wholey’s, the ﬁsh market, where you
can get some great tuna steaks for cheap.
Just fry those for roughly 45 seconds on
each side for dinner, serve on a bed of rice
pilaf and a side of asparagus. Needless to
say, you are in for a great night.

Schenley Plaza picnic: Nothing is bet-
ter than your own private picnic. Wait for
the warmer months, and then head over to
Merante’s Groceria at Bates and McKee.
Grab some cheese, tomatoes, grapes, bread

and a bottle of wine (or if you’re underage,_

sparkling cider) and head over to Schenley
Plaza with a blanket. Your date will call you
back, period.

Bike trip to Washington’s Landing: '

When it’s not raining in the ’Burgh, enjoy-
ing the sun is a necessity. With that in mind,
grab your bike —- or if you don’t have one,
rent it through the intramural office (355 for
the ﬁrst hour, and $2 every hour after that

’/ $20 for the day / 412-648-3151) —— and

 

head down to the  trail behind Posvar
Hall and follow that into Downtown. Head
to the point, pausing for a great photo-op,
then head across the river to the two sta-
diums. Follow the Pike trail east along the
Allegheny River.

There you’ll ﬁnd \Washington’s Landing
Island, the best damn island in Pittsburgh.
It’s the former home of Ben Roethlisberg-
er and boasts a great bar and restaurant.
Grab some calamari and dig in.

 

Sangria, your apartment: After you
have gotten comfortable with your date,
invite him or her over for some delicious
topless, oh I’m sorry, tapas and sangria.

Tapas are traditionally small Spanish dish-v

es, butyou can make pretty much anything.
Try olives and cheese, small meatballs or
marinated chicken strips.

The tapas will taste delicious with san-

' gria. Grab a cheap bottle of red wine, or-

anges, apples, brandy and triple sec.,- Add
cut oranges and apples to your wine, a

 “W”   ,.  

from p ge 2 0
half cup of brandy and triple sec and one-
fourth cup sugar. Your night is complete,‘
but if you can’t stay at home, top it all off
with lusty salsa dancing at the \Whitman
School in Squirrel Hill. It’ll show you how
to move your hips every Saturday night at
8 p.m. ' _

Pittsburgh has a great scene to explore.‘
Enjoy the city and use it to your advantage.
Dating will get you out of the dorm room
and into the city. Now all you have to do is
ﬁnd that date.
