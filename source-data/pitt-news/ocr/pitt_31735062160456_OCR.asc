Ceremonies Taken

Out of Fieldhouse

( See Editorial Page 4)

A petition campaign aimed at returning graduation ce-
remonies to the Cathedral lawn died a sudden death Monday
when the University itself decided to ‘shift the ceremonies
back to their traditional site on the lawn.

The surprise move came after a meeting of the Board
of Deans with Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald in his oﬁices

Monday morning.

At that meeting the Board voted
to reverse an earlier administra-
tive order which had scheduled
graduation for the new Memorial
Fieldhouse.

Congress Rallies Opposition

Student Congress last week had
moved to arouse student support
for retaining the ceremonies on
lawn by appointing Jim Rock as
chairman of a committee to cir-
culate petitions protesting the
change. Some petitions already
were in circulation this week,

A delegation from WSGA Senior
Court had paid a-visit to the Chan-
cellor to express the dissatisfaction

plan. Men’s Council and ODK
were on record as opposed to the
move. . .
In releasing the announce-
ment of the change, the Chan-
cellor said, “If it (the lawn cere- 
monies) means a lot to the peo-
ple who are graduating, then it

Boost Chest Total To

Approximately $156 was netted
Monday by the shoeshiners, fudge-
makers and cake-bakers in the
Pitt Chest Spring Campaign.

Continued sales during the
week, an auction yesterday after-
noon of the services of deans and
'faculty, and the big IM sports
carnival and dance Friday night
are expected to swell the total.

(See page 5 for details of the
sports carnival at the Field
House.)

The “White Elephant” sale of
items that have been gathering
dust in the Lost and Found of-
ﬁce netted the biggest return with
a reported $82 from sales of books,
grab bags full of pencils and pens,
and other articles misplaced by
absent-minded students.

In four hours of boot-blacking
members of Student,Congress, the
football team, and IF Council
cleared approximately $18.

Cookies and cakes baked by
members of Pan-Hellenic Council
were an early sellout in the Tuck
Shops Monday, netting about $17
for the campaign.

Big money-maker was the IF
Council fudge sale, which made
an estimated $39 after the cost of
materials was deducted.

When Queried by the Pitt-Poll-

Profs Favor Political Clubs

By ELINORE STONE
_In an eifort to discover what the faculty thinks of or-
ganizing student clubs on campus the Pitt News asked teach-
ers chosen at random from the undergrate schools the fol-

“Do you think that the estab-
lishment of student political
clubs on campus would be con-
trary to Pitt’s position as a state-
supported school?”

The answers in general favored
their sanction.

Dr. 0. L. Riser, professor of phi-
losophy: “I don’t ‘think we should
fear a cut in ‘funds in deciding,
whether ,to,_e,stablis,h such 

       

ligious groups, although we’re not
a church school, and we still get
state aid.”

Mr. J. W. Houston, lecturer in
history: ‘‘It would enable students
to participate intelligently and
honestly in political affairs. The
administration is right, however,
to look into all sides, of the issue
before condemning  favoring po-
litical clubs.” . ’

is more important than all of
the arguments against it.”

The chancellor was referring to
the arguments advanced in favor
of holding graduation in the Field-
house. Chief among these was the
argument that bad weather might
force the ceremonies off lawn into
an alternative indoor site.

Rained Last Year

Last year when it rained for the
ﬁrst time in the history of lawn
ceremonies the graduates and
their guests were forced to use
Syria Mosque. This, according to
the University, inconvenienced
both, guests and graduates.

If it should rain on June 11 this
year, the ceremonies will take
place in Soldiers and Sailors Me-
morial.

In expressing the opinion of
seniors on the change in plans,

OWl’s ‘Nest’ Robbed of Cash;
Officials VVonder W/‘ho-o-0?

 

Jacol)son’s Desk
Jimnlied in Theft

University officials are in-
vestigating the theft of $25
from the office of The Owl.

Thieves broke into the desk
of Owl Business Manager
Marvin Jacobson over the
week—end and made off with $25
in yearbook payment money.

According to Jacobson, whoever
stole the money jimmied open the
center desk drawer with a screw-
driver or similar tool and then
opened the drawer containing the

v cash. ‘

The thieves left $13 in the cash
drawer after taking the $25. Ja-

cobson believes. this was an at— ‘

tempt to conceal the fact that any
money was taken.

“The way I ﬁgure it”, he said,
“the thief wanted to leave some
money in it so I wouldn’t notice

there was anything taken from the — 

box. But I always check it before
I leave here, and the ﬁrst thing’ I
do in the morning is check the
money as a matter of habit.”

“Besides that”, he went on, “the

jimmy marks on both desk draw- I

ers are plainly visible and the cen-
ter drawer is out of line.’’

By GENE "W1-IINSTEIN
In its most uproarious session of the year, Student Con-
gress on Monday debated with a fury seldom seen here the
desirability of its basketball team wearing red ﬂannel under-
Wear against the Men’s Council quintette Friday night.

The game will be played at the:

Intra—Mural Sports Carnival with

both teams wearing boxing gloves.
Various congressmen proposed
that the Congress team also don

the red ﬂannels to add a distinc-
tive touch to. the aﬁair. '
Minority Wins Battle

Don. Milletary, Larry Adler, and
p1-exy Cyril Wecht fought the un-
derwear proposal bitterly. Solons
Jim‘  and Nancy Tear led the
successtul ﬁght for the ﬂannels.

should have enough school spirit
to spend a couple of bucks for red

of the game.”

Larry Adler labeled Rock’s pro-
posal a “farce.”

But it was SC president Cyril
Wecht who struggled the mostest
against the red‘ ﬁannels. Wecht
told the News.’

Wecht Charges Rigging

“I abide by the decision of the
majority, which however, I feel
’was rigged in this particular case.
»Never in my experience as‘presi-
dent of Congress have I seen! such
coercive and dictatorial methods
used in a vote.”

Wecht ‘added that he will be
wearing red flannel: Friday night,
“reluctantly.” ‘

Congress also announced the
three requisites for
change in its by-laws. Before the
by-laws change can be made the

Three Events Scheduled This Week

Drive To Bolster Enrollment Begins

Threatened with declining’ enrollment because of the*

draft and the Depression birth—rate drop, Pitt oiﬁcials are
going all out to recruit high school material.

March and April will see the University in an extended

campaign to encourage district
high school students to get their
education close to home-—namely
at Pitt.
Week-end Schedule

A schedule of events for visiting
high school- students lists three
.separ.ate programs for the guests
this week-end. According to J. Ed-
ward Ricart, assistant to the dean
of men, who arranged the sched-
ule for Pitt’s committee on high
school relations, over 600 high
schoolers will visit the campus
Saturday. '

But other events,‘ planned by

separate departments and schools
of the University, will be welcom-
ing the young students here on
different occasions into the month

of May. Purpose of the program‘

is to show guests what advantages
Pitt’s departments oﬁer to those
interested in particular ﬁelds of
study.

Spring Program Set

The spring high school program
will also include a future business
administration clinic, band icon-
cert, engineering open house, writ-
ers’ conference, and visits to his-
tory, geology and biology depart-

‘System of Mind Control

BY DAVE WINTER

Dr. George S. Counts, controversial authority on Russian‘ I
affairs, was anything but sympathetic to the Soviet state
when he spoke here last Thursday to a ‘standing-room-only

crowd in 324 C1.

The Columbia professor told reporters after his lecture‘

that he had changed his mind about many of the ideas he

advanced in books about the Russian Communists in the

1920’s and ’30’s. _
His talk was given at the third

-session of the annual Institute for

School Board members, sponsored
by the School of Education.

Dr. Counts deﬁned seven ele-
ments in “The Soviet System of
Mind Control” for the high school
board members. He concluded
with‘ a declaration that the at-
tempts at thought control and the
Stalin-worship make the Russian
state “a strange political pheno-
mena——-and we ought to be study-
ing about it.”

We need “not only armaments
and industrial strength” but an
understanding of what life is
like in Russia, he insisted.

The Soviet state is built upon
creed of the revolutionist—
“he who is not with me is against
me”——Dr. Counts explained.

Thus the schools, the arts, the
Communist party, and all printed
matter are closely controlled, used
as tools to shape the Russian mind.

The seven elements Dr. Counts
sees in the Soviet system are:

1. The All-Union Communist
Part -—“Better described as a po-

litical army because of its organ-~

ization and monopoly of legality.”

The party has approximately six
million members, with a 72—mem-
ber Politburo at the top, and su-
preme power, army-fashion, cen-
tefed in the 12-member Politburo
under Stalin, its policy—maker.

Recess Controlled

2. The Cultural Apparatus——This
includes three and one-half school
systems for the people, the mili-

tary, party workers, and an odd _

half for the Women separated now
in some schools. The schools are
so closely supervised that even

the recess period in the elementary V

school is set by the national gov-
ernment.

3. The Press and printed matter
-—Dr. Counts showed his listeners
two desk calendars, one from 1951,
stuffed with birthdays of Russian
‘inventions’ and heroes. Only one
mention of America was on each,
and both derogatory.

Public Fed Falsehoods

The public is constantly fed pic-
tures and stories of oppressed:
workers, like one in Pravda which-
walking city?
streets, shouting one word: “Bread?

describes crowds

--bread!” , ,
M(i)nc got. the most widely quoted

A
‘V’

 

sayings about the purpose of ed-
ucation, Dr. Counts said, is Stal-
in’s deﬁnition in an interview
with H. G. Wells: “Education is
a weapon whose effect depends
on whose hands it is hi and at
whom it is aimed.”
4. P,unishments—-The political
police and exile to Siberia are not
the only threats to Russians who

don’t stick to the party line..

‘Good’ writers, for instance are al-
ways loudly pro-Party-Line, and
neutrals are publicly slandered
and abused. f '
Fantastic Reward System
5. Rewards——“Publicv praise of

the most fantastic sort” is heaped '

on scientists,’ writers, and public
ﬁgures for every thing, even to a
special medal, one of many, for

the “Order of Heroic Motherhood”‘

to Women who bear ten or more
children.

6. Body of Doctrine-—Constantly
reiterated is the version of the
past, present and future as de-
scribed and foreseen by the “four
prophets-—Marx, Engels, L e n in
and Stalin.”

7. ‘Stalin-worship—This plays a
big part in the vision of the future
and almost every public gathering
ends with an idolatrous “Letter to
Stalin” and a standard salute

praising the Russian sacred trinity. .

that it appeals to all students in-

Aids in Three Ways

The program is designed to help
Visitors in three ways: it will show
them what facilities and person-
nel Pitt has; it may help them
make up their minds on what ca-
reers they are interested in; it will
outline scholarship and self-help
opportunities.

Up to now, high school recruit-
ing has been largely conﬁned to a
I-Iighlschool Day in the fall, when
the teen-agers‘ are guests of the
University at a football game and
dance.

Student publications played host
to 900 high school students earlier
this year at the University’s ﬁrst
publications institute‘.

it moved to preserve one of the most ap-
pealing of them,‘ the graduation ceremonies
on thetlawn. '

Most of our Pitt traditions appeal only to
particular groups or special mentalities; they

have no ﬁrm roots in the student body. Many‘

of them are artiﬁcial or superﬁcial or in the
process of being formed and so have no at-
tractions for the average student.

The one tradition which has captured both
the imaginations and emotions of the general
student body is the graduation ceremonies,
especially those which take place on the Ca--
tliedral lawn.

There are obvious reasons why gradua-
tion should be a particularly rewarding day,
bothin a spiritual and vulgar sense; it is
the last day ofischool. But the reaction of

V the seniors to the projected move of the pro-
gram to the Fieldhouse, is sufficient indica-
tion that -the site plays an important part in
attitudes toward the day. I

The tradition has been built ‘up around
the program on the lawn. We hope the Uni-

\"versity will in future years keep this in

mind. We congratulate those who brought
it to-the administration’s attention. The chan-
cellor and the Board of Deans should also be
congratulated for recognizing genuine stu-
dent feeling.

The 19 Citations

Dr- George Counts, the Columbia educator who
spoke here last Thursday night, found the red
, carpet laid out in more than one way. An over-
M ﬂow audience heard him speak on “The Soviet
, System of Mind Control.” And he was greeted b
charges of Communist leanings." " M '

Rev. W. O. H.MGarman, vice president of the

American Council of Churches,
and ‘Mrs. E. M. Payne, chairman

burgh, made the accusations.
The charge of disloyalty to
one’s country is about as serious
’ an‘ attack as can be ‘ leveled
against a man. The charges Mr.
Garman» made against Dr. Counts
"of “his many activities of years’
stgndings . in dangerous   _ , 
pro—Red subversive operations. . .” practically
equivalent to charges of disloyalty.‘ Most people

 

. will agree that attacks by one man impugning an-

other’s loyalty should be amply substantiated by
‘the record.

1 Charges Valid?

I ’ How valid are Mr. Garman’s speciﬁc charges?
Do they show Dr. Counts to be a subversive per-
son? They do not. V ' M -

Mr. Garman said that Dr. Counts had been cited
19 times by the House Committee on Un-Ameri-

can Activities.’ The Wilkinsburg minister also ob-,

jected to Count's literary efforts.

Some years agp Counts, it seems, translated a ~

-book by a Russian author entitled IM‘Want to be Like
Stalin. Mr. Garman said the book was “ﬁlled with
lies” and hit Dr. Counts for not warning the read-
er of that fact in his introduction.

Much has been said in the past about “guilt .by
Now, if we are to accept this type
ofreasoning, “guilt by translation” will also be

in vogue. Perhaps a transltaion, for instance, of,

Mein Kampf from the German means the transla-
M't0r is a Facist? ,’ r
I ‘Let us turn to the “l9 citations” which Mr.

,Ga‘rman says damn Dr. Counts. Are citations by

the House Committee on Un-American Activities
M acceptable evidence of disloyalty to the/nation?

Nomi‘ Personally Disloyal — .

In its 19 citations the House committee did not
say that Dr. Counts had ever perosnally done any-
thing of a disloyal nature; it said he ‘had in the
past belonged to 19 groups the committee deemed
“Un-American” _in character. This is guilt by as-
sociation. ‘ M

A thorough analysis of the Committee’s proced-
ure’s and practices can be found in Alan Barth’s
The Loyalty of Free Men. In it, Barth says that
the effect of the committee has been to “censor
andpenalize political and economic ideas of which
its members disapproved.”

The record only shows Dr. Counts to have been
guilty of” being a liberal. This, as yet, is not a
crime in the United States.

Finally, it IS well to remember that if there is
anything the matter with Dr. Counts, why did

’ General Eisenhower not do something‘ about it

Letters To The Editor . . . . L
Reader Urges 'Americanism'

Editor
The Pitt News L

The Pitt News and others in
this university have long taken

the stand against the loyalty oath

without bothering to. explain why
the public doubts the loyalty of
teachers. Dr. Counts, who spoke
here last Thursday is a living
example of why the publicsis
aroused. \In all fairness the
viewpoint of someone else besides
the educators shouldbe explain-
ed to the students at Pitt.

I heard Dr. Counts on Thurs-
day and I would like to clear
up one point.
nothing to repudiate the com-

munistic principle as set down.

by Marx. Dr. Counts said
that Russian Communism was
not Marxism. He said that an
understanding of both Marxism
and Russian Communism should
be taught to students in school.
To top that off he said “We need
to ask ourselves soberlyz What
are the values of a free society?”

In the past this professor has 1'

asked himself this question and
has published the results ‘of his
investigation. In the early thir-
ties in a book called the “Soviet
Challenge to America” he de-

scribes our free society as “the,

selﬁsh scramble for wealth and
privilege, the cruel disregard for
the less sensational forms of hu-
man suffering, the relative ab-
sense of a sense of social respon-
sibility, the reluctance to come
honestly to grips with the ma-
jor problems «of the times, and
the apparent decay of politica ,

, ethical, argl normal life.”

He comprzred this with the So-
viet which he described as, “the
disciplined effort of the Soviet to
industrialize the country, to so-
cialize agriculture, to liquidate
unemployment, to desseminate
knowledge, and generally, to
raise the material and spiritual
level of the masses. . . ”

If this is not advocating Rus-
sian Communism, it is certainly
advocating the theory of Com-
munism, if not directly, then in-
directly. I believe in academic
freedom as much as anyone, but
there are also freedoms which

Dr. Counts said I

in justices of .3 free society.

are most important and without
which there would be no aca-
demic freedom. These freedoms
cannot be laid on the sacriﬁcial
block of “academic freedom. I

v would not want my children in-

doctrinated in political socialism
either directly or indirectly. I
would question academic free-
dom on these grounds._ I

What’s more, if we teach an
understanding of Communismlin

the schools, shouldn’t we also
teach‘ an understanding of Amer-

icanism? I have heard every kind
of “ism” explained at Pitt ex-
cept Americanism. Why is that?

It is because we are a ‘nation
of free individuals who acknow-
ledge God. Education has turn-
ed its back'on the latter while it
points to the inequalities and in-
To
quote one eminent educator of

'. the Dewey-Counts school, “The

religious aim of education must
give way to the gospel of social
efeciency.” The Communist ideal
is this “gospel of social efficien-
cy” and it acknowledges no God
other than the masses of hu-
manity . . .

To neglect religion in educa-
tion, treating man as simply the
most intelligent animal on the
face of the earth, at the same
time teaching this» social gospel
is by indirection teaching Com-
munism . . The public is de-

. manding some Americanism in

the schools ‘and if the educators
don’t wise up they will ﬁnd the
sanctity of their academic free-
dom tossed right out of the win-
dow.
’ At least it is time that we at
Pitt put the issues squarely -‘on
the line and have a vigorous de-
bate in plain language so that
we may all know where we
stand, what we are ﬁghting for,
and what we are ﬁghting against.
This confusion has gone far
enough.

cates that the number of students‘ studying in the

classics is steadily declining. There are possibly

many sound‘ reasons why this trend is so pronounc-
‘ed and why it will probably continue. The best
answer, of course, lies in the increasing complexity .
of our society with its emphasis on specialization.
Until this century brazened
its way into being, the only real-
ly acceptable area of academic
endeavor for the well-bred and
the intellectual was the classics.
You were expected to have a
sound background in Greek and
Latin and not one gleaned from
reading books about books. The
litergture and journalism of the
past presupposed that /you knew .  , _ 
your Greeks and Romans in the original.
I have just ﬁnished making ‘up an incomplete
in a classic course on Greek literature which I
began in my second year here. I don’t know why
I didn’t ﬁnish it way back then, but I wish I had.
One of the requirements for the course involved
reading two plays by Aristophanes, the master of
Greek comedy and to my mind the master of
comedy through all literature. If I had read him
when I should have, I would have gone on to the
rest of his plays, as I now propose to do.
He has a breadth of humor which ranges from

    

. the leer to the -slyly satirical. You can find every

possible professional and natural device for ‘ex- 1
tracting a laugh. And he is refreshingly close to ,
ﬂie humor of everyday living, and sometimes his ,

jokes are monumentally lewd.
Another requirement of the course led me into
the dialogues of Socrates preserved by Plato.’ Here

you have two great minds that spoke with clarity ' K
and purpose, surpassingly superior to the genteel _ :f .

intellectual giants we admire so in the Atlantic
Monthly. M e I A

But the most outstanding characteristic of Ar-

istophanes and Plato and his teacher, Socrates; is

their absolute honesty. They do not quibble either . I

in their earthy expressions nor. in their moral
theses. _If a man is an ass he does not become

a bore;’if a man is doomed he is not promised, _

salvation. .
.Their teachings and morals are not clouded in
the mincing vacuities of the modern intellectual‘.
They do not romanticize their weaknesses and
write novels about them; they believe in the in-

’ dividual but they do not offer him opiates for

his own frailties. They are, as I said before, hon-
est. And they expect their fellowmen to be honest.
It is this quality- in their writing which makes

it especially unfortunate that less people are now . j

exposed to them. .-

.Riflers Eye Regionals
And West Virginia

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

Pitt riﬂers draw their toughest assignments of the year
in three post-season shoulder-to-shoulder matches.

After compiling a 9-1 record against the best the district
could offer by way of the Greater Pittsburgh Riﬂe League,
Sgt. Paul Bryan’s gunners have two inVitationals—-the Buffalo
Regionals Saturday and a shooters’ clambake in Washington,

D. C. next week.

In between, though, West Vir-
ginia (9-1) and Pitt shoot for the

"league title in a playoff match

next Wednesday night on the
Washington and J efferson range.
The W&J site was chosen because
it’s half the distance between both
schools.-

, At Buffalo Next

That’s the one the gunners are
aiming for, especiall after their
second loss in the invitation tri-
angular meeting at Morgantown
last Saturday when the Mountain-
eers-blasted the Panthers, 1411-
1397. Kent. State was third best
with a 1361 total.

Pitt beat its hilltop neighbors
earlier, 1400-1398.

Their immediate sights, how-
ever, are set on the rifle shoot
sponsored by the National Riﬂe

A

Association at the University of
Buﬁalo. Eight to ten teams in-
cluding West Virginia are expect-
ed to enter the, NRA’s Regional
Intercollegiate Small Bore Riﬂe
Tournament this weekend.

Noroski Top Gunner

Sgt. Bryan in his ﬁrst year
as coach led the riﬂers to the team
championship last year. One of his
riﬂemen, Andre Levino, now a
junior, captured individual hon-
ors with a 281 mark.

Both hope to repeat as leaders.
Levino probably will have trou-
ble from one of his teammates, Bill
N oroski, who currently is the lead-
ing shooters on the Pitt squad.
Noroski also boasts the best mark
ever recorded by a Pitt gunner,
a remarkable 291 of a 3030 perfect
target. I

winter sports occurred in the

riﬂe ranks where the Blue-and-Gold gunners shot their way
to a nine win, one loss season in the Greater Pittsburgh

Riﬂe League.

Yet Sgt. Paul Bryan’s lads almost ﬁnished out of
the money. That is until last Saturday at Morgantown,
W. Va. Strangely enough, it took a setback to‘ push the
Panthers into a playoﬁ with the Mountaineers.

In Saturday’s aﬁair the Pitts
were invited by the Mounties to
an exhibition shooting along with
Kent State. The
Mounties w o n
th e ‘triangular
in e e t q u it e

After the ex-
11 i b it ion was
0 V e r, Bryan’s
pride was hurt
but the Pitts
still had a 9-1
record, and, for
that In a t t e r ,
WVU had an
identical chart.

A week before this the Pan-
thers had clipped the Mounties,
1400-1398, at the Stadium forc-
ing the tie. WVU had won in an
earlier meet. Major John Nich-
olas of West Virginia and also

. president of the league, ﬂatly
stated that the Mounties would
be declared the league champion
-since the by-laws state that the
team posting the highest aggre-
gate score would be the cham-

However, Bryan couldn’t ﬁnd
this ruling in the by-laws, and he‘
mentioned this to Nicholas last

Saturday. At ﬁrst, the major

 

wanted to include the ruling in the »

books this year, but thought dif-

cided to have a playoff meet at a.
neutral site--Washington and Jet-.
ferson next Wednesday.

So if the Pitts don’t Win the

IM Roundup

 

least won the verbal battle to place
them in the playoffs.

According to a reliable ob-
server, the Mounties have been
attempting shady tricks all sea-
son, such as rattling Pitt’s ace
shooter —- Bill Noroski — into
missing the target. (It is cus-
tomary to have silence from the
spectators when teams are
ﬁring.) -

Another example of unorthodox
practices came when Nicholas took
the ward of one of his shooters on
the results of one of the targets in
the meet with Pitt. When the ﬁnal
check was made by Bryan it was
noticed that the Mounties had er-
rored by two points and enabled
the Pitts to notch the victory.

WVU Champ Last Year

A telephone conversation with a
WPIAL riﬂe official brought this
interesting comment: “I never
heard of such a thing, (highest
aggregate team score wins) and I
don’t see how anyone could think

f tt‘ .h l ' th A
o pu mg suc apan in erule 1950

boo .” ,

What makes the controversy
more amusing is the fact that in
the last three years the six-team
league has been dominated by
the Mounties and Pitt. ,

Last year WVU was crowned
champion with Pitt a close second.
In 1949 and 1950 the Panthers
were league victors. Last year the
Duquesne Dukes created‘ a minor

war in the league when they could .

do nothing against league opposi-
tion, but won the William Ran-
dolph Hearst award for their
amazing sh o oti ng in postal
matches. -

inalists Slarvivc Competition

Many sports made their ap-
pearances'"in competition in
the last two weeks as the in-
tramural program went into high
gear. Finalists in ‘ individual
wrestling and All-Campus dou-
bles and singles ping-pong will
play in the Sports Carnival ‘Fri-
day night after surviving their
tests in playoﬁ games.

Badminton also got into the
picture as the IF teams come into
the last stages of a double-elim-
ination tourney which will end
with a championship match at the

Carnival.

Meanwhile, <.‘:3‘:1-7.;Ib?.'1l started

Monday with 34 squads entered-

The tournament will be run like
the badminton championships.

Mert Five reached the semi-
ﬁnalsof the basketball Al1-Cam-

gineers, Newmeyer Tigers, and the
Pharmacy Mixers advanced to
ﬁrst round contests in last week’s

Walk To Be
Completed

By April

The Panther Club announc-
ed today that the engraving
of the names of past athletic
awardees will be completed by
mid-April on Varsity Walk.

The Walk, which lies between
the Cathedral and Heinz Chapel,
parallel to Omicron Delta Kappa
Walk, is the second to be set aside
for honors to individual students.

The ﬁrst three names to be en-
graved ‘upon it are those of Lou
Cecconi, 195-0 winner of the ath-
letic committee award, Sam Sha-
piro, 1951 Hartwig awardee, and
George Radosevich, 1951 athletic
committee awardee.

Names of the 1952 winners will
be announced at Varsity Day, to
be held on the Cathedral lawn

V May 14.

b Each year on Varsity Day two
students receive honors—-one, the

athletic committee award; and the ~

other, the Charles C. Hartwig
award, given to the undergraduate
who’ has done most to promote
athletics at the University.
‘Varsity "Walk, in addition to
awardee’s names, will be engrav-
ed with the emblem of the Pan-
ther Club, athletic fraternity
which backed the establishment
of the walk, and with this legend:
“In dedication to undergraduate
students who are promoting the
University of Pittsburgh through
varsity athletics.” ~ ,

Grady Becomes

  Swami of Swim

With Predictions

Swimming Coach Ben Grady
continues to taunt the athletic
family with the accuracy of
his predictions on Pitt swim-
ming fortunes. /

Last year Grady picked his
team to miss the ECSA cham-
pionship by half a point. He
was off by only one and a half.
which is shaving it pretty
close.

This year at the winter
sports banquet, he again went
out on a limb——promising an
easy victory for his crew this
time. The tankers wound up
40 points ahead.

The secret-—Grady immerses
himself in swimming records,
pools his information, drinks
nothing but water, and wears
only sharkskin suits.

NOTRE DAME AND PITT will
tangle in three different sports
this spring. The schedule shows
a baseball doubleheader May 2-3
and a track meet May 3, at home,
while the Panther tennis team vis-

Matmen Finish Third
In Best 4.-I Showing g

By DON SCHURMAN

Handicapped by their lack
of numbers, Rex Peery’s
wrestlers made the most of’
what they had and conse-
quently placed third in the
Four I tournament at Cleve-
land last weekend.

Only five of Coach Peery’s mat-»
men competed in the tourney, but
all ﬁve placed in point-winning
positions, to ﬁnish with a team to-
tal of 22 points. -

The 22-point effort was the best
showing a Pitt team has made in
three years of Four I competition,

but it was a full 16 points behind,
the winning Waynesburg matmeni

and seven points behind runnerup
Toledo.

The Panthers, nevertheless, bet- L

tered all expectations, inasmuch as
both Waynesburg and Toledo had

  

   

,._. entered full teams often 

ix

  

V‘

I each.

To offset the two-to-one numer-
ical disadvantage, wiry 117-pound
Hugh Peery had to execute the
most outstanding performance of
the day for the Panthers.

With remarkable ease, Peery
breezed to a 12-3 decision in the
semi-ﬁnals and then a 7-3 victory
in the ﬁnals. He was the only

blue-ribbon winner of the ﬁve-
: man squad. ‘

cisions, ‘however, two other Pan- 1 .

Mrs. Andrew Bernhard, assist-
ant professor of journalism: “I
think it's very important for stu-
dents at every university to be in-
terested in political issues and take
part actively in any campaigning
if they wish. I feel, however, that
political meetings should be kept
off campus.”

Mr. C. H. Anderson, lecturer in
history: “Political clubs on campus
would be ﬁne. They wouldn’t be
sponsored by the university nor
favor one political group.”

Mr. E. L. Peterson, professor of
English: “From an ideal point of
view, political clubs would be very
good. From a practical point of
view, however, there might be a
lot of difﬁculty. The temper of the
people is very sharp these days.”

A usually mild-mannered and easy-going

the trickiness of most of theso-called cigarette

mildness tests! He knew there was one

honest test of cigarette mildness. Millions of smokers

everywhere know, too - there’s one true test!

It’: the sensible test .7 . . the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels

as your steady smoke - on a pack-after-pack,
