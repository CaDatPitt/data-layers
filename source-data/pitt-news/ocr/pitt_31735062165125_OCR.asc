S C Considers Mc C arran   Act
Exec To Study PIA Collapse S

meeting last Monday, Representative Joe Banik, .Col. ’56,
_ urged Student Congress to take a stand in behalf of the Uni-
.varsity body against the McCarran Internal Security Act of

1950. Wisconsin students have

already comeout in opposition

of the act which is ambiguous, in its identiﬁcation of Com-
munist-associated organizations. - ‘

‘President Bob Sedler referred:

the decision to today’s meeting of
‘the executive board. Banik stat-
ed_pessimistically after the ‘meet-
- jng, “There is a lack of policy in
"the University and in SC. Most
students are afraid to take a stand
V_‘ on political issues.” ‘
‘ Banik suggested that a com-
mittee be organized to review
7 "certain parts of the Act and its ‘
implications in reference to stu-
~ den_ts at this university. But be-
cause of the late hour when only
half of the representatives were
‘present, Sedler referred the bus-
iness to executive. .
Congress members also refused
during the meeting to accept the
v resignation of Pitt Independent
_p , ‘Association Representative Don

Miller, Col. ’§6. SC’ executive com-
mittee urged that Miller remain
active despite that PIA is no long-
er a functioning body on campus.
It disbanded last week due to lack
of student and faculty support.
-Jenny Hoffman, Col. ’57,
chairman of the Student -Faculty
Relations committee, stated that
her group will discuss the inde-
pendent student problem tomor-
row in.135 Cl. ,
During Monday’s meeting, Uni-
versity officials released the an-
nouncement that Christmas vaca-
tién will be extended one day be-
cause of the Sugar Bowl game.

Men’s Council expects to
adopt proposed changes in its
Constitution during a special
meeting called for this after-

, I100l’1. , _ .

- The proposal, brought to the
yﬂoor by the MC Constitution

Committee last Wednesday, was
tabled because is proved to be
unpopularwith some councilmen.

, “I think the. fellows were hesi-

tant to adopt the proposal because

they didn’t fully understand it.
,  thinks it will pass this time
without too much trouble since
the fellows have had, some time
4 to think about it.” said MC Presi-
ﬁgdent Dimitri Petrol earlier this

' week. ,

The proposal would permit ﬁve
seniors, four juniors,_ and four
sophomores to be elected as at-
large representatives by popular
University vote during Spring

._,-_-<13’

would -' be elected through the
freshman Men’s Conference pro-
gram. Nominees now come from
any school on the campus.

Opponents of the Petro en-
udorsed resolution wish to keep
the present procedure_ in which
the candidates are “proportion-
ately” electedfrom each school.
They feel that an independent’s
chances, should be “weakened”
because of the strength political
parties could naturally exert.

_ , Supporters of the proposal feel
_.-~' , that it would help to obtain
‘ _‘ “better and more active Council
g ~ ' representation.” '

I ' Many Advantages
-1 ,“We feel that there are advan-
_* ' tages in gettingpbetter men. If
2 there are ﬁve good men in The
L College who are interested, they
could_be seated.” Petro argued.
Although the “at-large” pro-
, _ posal was tabled, Petro was able
‘. to get a revision of the class-
‘;_ oﬁicer representation.
As in the past, Business Ad-
_ministration, The College, and

Another constitutional change
was made regarding the MC
standing appointments. The Con-
stitution had speciﬁed that the
president appoint the following
committee chairmen: athletics,
freshman orientation and tradi-
tions, men's lounge, publications,
religious, social, speech, music and

Extra-curricular activity should comprise more than
“integrating guild groups; it must mean more than shining
trophies earned for festival races; it must connote rgore
substantial products than tea in the commons room or eer
in a local pub; it -should develop ,more than poster contests
or singing ﬁas'cos. It -must stimulate thinking for everyday
use. _
Very few ‘activities on campus actually contribute to_ a
student’s critical ability._The only challenge a social chair-
man has, other than ﬁnding new angles for parties, 1S not to
make as many mistakes as the previous, chairman. Guilds
inhibit student thinking by limiting participation in the ex-

-.tra-curricular program. They prevent the growth of intel-

lectual curiosity, by having explained to students the‘things
which they’sho‘uld expect in college life.

Athletic chairmen seek bigger andibetter. awards; pltesw AV
idents hunt desperately for p_i;ograms that Wlll prove t ell‘

However this weekend we Wlll have the opportunity to
view a major program designed to encourage creative think-
ing, logical expression, rational action. The annual _Pitt

England will debate the affirmative and negative arguments.

of Guaranteed Annual Wage. . . _ _

This topic is especially signiﬁcant in the city of Pitts-
burgh, the heart of the nation’s heavy industry. N_ext_year,
-union giants will meet with steel magnates in this city to
argue in terms of dollars and cents the problem of annual
contracts granting 52 weeks of pay and fringe benefits to
employees. '

Participating debaters will have the rich experience

invited to all debates. But what is most important is that the
students will have collected individual data; will have or-
ganized it; will have chosen the important arguments; will
have learned to logically express them by the time they take
the podium. _
' Debaters can’t afford to resign themselves tothe ivory
towers of activity programs which ignore action in down-
town newspapers. They must read; their studies must tie
in directly with outside inﬂuencesto be valuable. And while
they too like their drinks hard, nimble minds thwart_ the
lethargy caused by inebriation which so many students carry
into their school activity." ' '
' We’ve come to the point where we frown upon,scholars—
who rarely engage in school activities. They -aren’t well-
rounded,«we say. But it is far better to- devote oneself to

serious study than to mingle book learnin’ with time-con- '

‘ suming activities which ring hollow one week after gradua-

tion. I .

' We "think that students should make it a point to sit in
on a few debates this weekend. .Gu_aranteed Annual Wage
is a stimulating subject. Intelligent student debaters will

provide necessary relief from the ordinary students who '

take economics because it is a required cqurse.

A Rallying Point     ‘

St dent spirit was once again squelched by University
authori ies last Monday when several students appeared
with signs in the Tuck Shop, ﬁfth hour, to protest the despic-
able actions of Georgia’s Governor Marvin Grifﬁn. The stu-
dent demonstration w-as scheduled to get underway in the
Tuck Shop but. was “nipped in the bud?’ by.members of the
Dean of Men’s Staff. ' n ' . , ,
- In a statement to the press, Dean of "Men T. W. Biddle
charged that the boys had _been “duped” by some source
, outside the University. The Dean explained that the planned
'"’ral1y« would.have been distracting" to _the rest of the student
'body—even though it had been set for the Tuck Shop. He
stated that it was “a student thing and not a University
thing;” as a result, he refused to let anyone photograph the
effigy of the Georgia governor which had been made by

students. He wished “to make light of the situation”; there- -

fore, we can’t understand why newspapers were not per-

‘ .mitted access to the signs or the dummy. .

y—-:5

The idea of an outside source instigating the rally is,
of course, possible, but these participating students who
are known to possesshigh moral standards protested on such
basis. They wished to praise rallying Tech students and con-
demn the action of hate’-monger Governor Grifﬁn.

Certainly it could not have harmed the University’s rep- -

utation for students to rally behind such a purpose. We
doubt that Mr. Biddle had any authoritative basis for
squelching the innocent student demonstration. —
‘C i The fact that such a rally was purposely planned for the
Tuck Shop, that students had no desire to interrupt classes
is proof enough that it was to be handled in an orderly
fashion. ~
It seems that the University handled the matter in some-
what of a jellyﬁsh manner on Monday. Students shouldbe

. permitted to spend their free lunch hours as they wish; they

 

"should not be so thwarted without good reason. C.R.‘

Extemli Invitations

Each year, the Commons Room Christmas Ball, serves
as an appropriate affair to highlight the year’s social calen-
dar, to_ officially begin the holiday season for the student
body.‘ One of two dances permitted in the‘ Commons Room

portunities for all students, to socialize together.

By Irving Bloom
Member. Varsity Debate Team

A Guaranteed Annual Wage should not be viewed
as a complete cure for all the economic aches and
pains of the United States. It is only an instrument
by which certain defects in the economy can be
dealt with.

What exactly is meant by a GAW? There are
many differing plans and we of
the Affirmative have taken some
features of the oustanding plans
and come up with a compromise. '
First, there would be a 65 per
cent guarantee of take-home pay
in conjunction with unemploy-
ment compensation. . .

S e c o n (1, management , would
contribute 45 per cent of its pay-
roll into a General Insurance _
Fund. Dr. Seymour Harris of Harvard has said this
is a sound, practical ﬁgure to support the fund.
Third, workers would be able to transfer GAW
rights from job to job. Fourth, there would. be a
year’s waiting period for each. worker to acquire
seniority.

Status Quo Change

Now that we_ know what the affirmative means
by GAW, let’s look into the problems necessitating
a change in the status quo. In debating this topic,
no one can deny that our country is at a peak. of
prosperity. National income is at a-peak, business
is humming along, etc. There are still‘ some dark
patches in this sky of blue. _ I , A

The ﬁrst major problem is insecurity of the
worker caused by technological and seasonal unem-
ployment. The afﬁrmaitive isinot. opposed to tech-
nological improvements. They eventually create
more jobs but we feel that the worker should be

 

, protected in the transitional period until the new‘

job is created._ _ _ .

For example, the Ford Co. recently installed
automation’ in its ‘engine block plant at Buffalo,
N. Y. The work force was cutin one year from 2000
to 145. The Budd Manufacturing Co. of Philadelphia
cut its work force by means of automation from
7613 to 3500 in a period of one year.

‘Forced to Struggle. _  ,

These workers shouldn’t be forced to struggle
along on one third of their pay as at present. Work-
ers affected by seasonal unemployment would also
be affected by GAW; In past years Ford has taken
anywhere from six weeks to two months to change
over its fall models. .

This year, in anticipation of next year’s contract
which has provisions for a limited form of GAW,
Ford took only three days to make the change-over.
If workers are going to be paid during layoffs, there
will be an increased incentive to management to
make use of the workers.’ -

A second major need for GAW,i's the threat of a
recession to the economy. We admitted previously

_ that we are now at an all-time ‘peak of. prosperity.

We were at another all-time peak in 1953, but that
didn’t preclude the setback of 1954. We also have
had other recessions as recently as 1949-1950. Every-
one -agrees that recessions are bad for consumers,
labor, andindustry. How would GAW help the
situation?
In Workers‘ Hands

Money would be put into the hands of. the work-
ers who would naturally spend it since they would
be getting less than normal pay. Such spending
would tend to create a demand fortmore products.
To produce more products, management would hire
‘more workers. ' . ' I ,

This is just a practical application of John M.
Keynes’._multiplier theory. By adopting GAW in_
times of prosperity and taking money from the

‘ economy now we would be chipping off a peak of

the economy, but by pouring money back into the
economy in bad times, we would be ﬁlling in the
valleys of recession. -

We hear today the same complaints heard years
ago on other advances in labor relations. Things
such as unions, seniority, pensions, medical bene-
ﬁts, etc. were interfering with management right
and; costs would be ruinous. Twenty—ﬁve years

Con: GAW? No Thank Yoda ,

_ By Dan Levitt
‘President. Men's Debate Association

Is GAW the inevtiable wave of the future? Be-
fore we permit anyone to stampede the American
people into adopting the guaranteed annual wage ‘
on a national basis, we must ask ourselves two
critical questions: (1) do we need totamper with A
the prosperous American economy? and (2) what
disadvantages will the guaran- - -» H
teed annual wage burden us
with? _

Close inspection of today’s
economy reveals that there is no
demanding need for GAW. When
we consider the current level of
prosperity, the .indications for the
future, and _modern safety de-
vices, we must ask ourselves  ,
“why tamper?"  ' '2 ,

Today's picture just isn’t a bad one. The federal
government reports that unemployment is at a
post-war low—2.1 million; that emplyoment is at
an all-time high—65.5 million; that personal income -

    

is setting records—-$307.5 billion; that the gross-‘
national product is sky-rocketing—$38-7 billion.‘

There is no ecpnomic emergency today.
Prosperity Promised A ‘

In addition, trusty business indicators such as

construction plans for next year«(44 _billion) and ‘
business expansion plans for 1956 (31 billion). proma ;
ise continuing prosperity. Harvard economists, gov- .
ernment experts, and, the average man see no signs »
of a coming recession. If bad times are somewhere in, ,
the offing, we already have devices to handle them.-

‘We’re not living in 1929 anymore than we’i‘e living .
in 1066. High government spending, unemployment '
compensation, Social Security, regulation‘ by the -
Federal Reserve Board and the SEC, and huge -
amounts of life insurance and pension funds all -

make mass unemployment an unlikely contingent‘.
Where is the mass unemployment and the immi-

nent threat of recession that advocates of niitional '

.GAW say they are going to cure? These GAW sup-
porters, like Don Quixote, are tilting against wind-
mills. ‘

Besides, there being no need to tamper with our -

economy, the init}'ation of a national GAW would
produce serious disadvantages: (1)
beneﬁts, (2) a reductionin. the number of available '
jobs, and (3) an increase in economwic instability.
Let’s take a closer ‘look. ’ ‘ ‘ -
GAW Not Effective ‘ . ~
GAW doesn’t do much good. Low seniority work-
ers, part-time employees, striking workers, people
who voluntarily quit jobs, sick employees, workers

ﬁred for misconduct—al1 would -be excluded from. -

most GAW plans. Yet these excluded workers make
up most of our unemployed; the government esti-

mates_ that low-seniority workers alone constitute '_
then, beneﬁts from, .

75% of those out of work. Who,
GAW? Very few. .

GAW tends to reduce the number of available
jobs—a serious disadvantage in’ a country with an
increasing population. Under GAW, every American
business would put money into a fund for every
worker employed. Companies that already have

GAW--—Sea'rs and Roebuck, Procter and Gamble, I

Hormel——tend to hirefewer new workers. What
does this mean for new workers coming into the
working force?-Where will they get jobs?

GAW creates instability,-Professor Schlicter of
Harvard ‘suggests that reduced purchasing power
is the only condition that could produce a recession
in our economy. When people are able to buy less,

- business activity drops. Yet GAW increases labor

costs and prices, without increasing wages. By
deﬁnition, then, GAW reduces purchasing poWer..
a dangerous thing. ’

When we realize that there is no need for GAW
and that it has serious disadvantages. the American
people will reject ;a national guaranteed annual
wage.

from now, we will look back and scoff at the objec-
tions to GAW the same way in which we scoff today
at the_objec_tions to other advances. "

“They have four regulars back
and against Edinboro won by a 30

big game and they will be gunning

remedied by game experience. ' »_._‘

This means that Julius Pegues-~ ' "

wards, Chuck I-Iursh and Joe Fen-’

Prime concern of the ﬂoor C030?!
is the locals’ foul shooting alld

Young Christian Students and in the Chicago ‘Club; Because
John feels one should make employment plans early,_heTs starting
. . his investigations during his junior year. i

A. Hicks Lawrence answers:

Well, John, as the Old Man of the Sea told Sinbad the
Sailor, “The quantity -of travel varies with the speciﬁc
situation encountered.” Of course, you’ll never be ship-
wrecked or encounter the other travel problems that
Sinbad did, but a man shouldn’t seriously consider a
career in sales wbrk unless he really enjoys travel. Most
of our sales personnel do just that, because the work
itself provides so inany rewards and satisfactions. It’s
not unusual for a representative to be away from home
base .30 to 60 per cent of the time. ‘
You see, John, for a good salesman, every trip means ~
meeting new people, new situations, and new chal-
lenges. Every one of these offers a chance to display
individual initiative. Perhaps the customer will need
technical advice on applying our product to a speciﬁc
. item he’s ‘developing. The Du Pont salesman may
_ choose to use his own experience and “trouble-shoot”
on the spot. On the other hand, he‘ may refer the prob-
lem to “home base,” where he knows he’ll be- backed
up by a strong technical organization. This lmowledge
. naturally stimulates a salesman and heightens his inter-
est in’his_.work. He knows that he never travels
