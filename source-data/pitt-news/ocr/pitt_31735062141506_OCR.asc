Bowman, Student Council
Endorse YMCA Action

.,_._.. .& .

rive

Chancellor John G. Bowman lauded
the work of the campus YMCA in
conducting the Welfare Fund Cam-
paign on the campus in a statement
to W. W. Mendenhall, executive Y
secretary. “I believe that the stu-
dents will respond glazlly to the limit
they can go in suporting the YMCA
VVelfare Campaign, without any argu-
ment. They appreciate as keenly as
anyone what actual want means, and
they will be quicker than most people
to help,” the Chancellor said.

With this endorsement and with a
working group of two hundred and
fifty student solicitors and captains,
the YMCA begins the campus-wide
-drive for funds on Wednesday, No-
vember 9. Cooperating with the fac-
ulty campaign under the direction of:
Dr. S. B. Linhart, the Y group will
solicit students in the professional
schools and in all undergraduate
schools of the university.

At‘ a student council meeting last
Tuesday a unanimous resolution en-
couraging the campus drive was
passed. Reed Rose, Dent. ’33, coun-
cil president, said, “The student coun-
cil heartily endorses the movement
and urges the whole-liearte-d participa-
tion of the student body in a city-
wide effort to relieve distress and
care for character-building agencies?’

Twenty-ﬁve captains are being ap-
pointed by the student lVelfare Drive
headquarters in the Y hut. Captains
for the various schools and organiza-
tions will be announced next week.
An all-solicitors’ luncheon will be
held at I-Ieinz House on the day pre-
ceding the opening of the drive.

Student Traditions Committee’ Will Lead Drive for Funds
to Buy New Suit for Threadbare Mascot

 

Aspersions, nay, dirty digs have been cast at our mascot, the

Panther. We resent them. In stor
after the Pitt-A1-my game, written

ies appearing in New York pa.pers
by leading sport scribes, the Pan-

ther was referred to as “a moth-eaten beast,” and again as “ai1 im-
personation, of Bull Montana without makeup.”

But fear no more, nor cast down your heads in shame.

News has taken the challenge and.

Pitt
with the aid of; the student tradi-

tions committee of Student Council:
plans to deck out the Panther in a
brand new garment, skin, or what
have you. No longer will writers, un-
doubtedly accustomed to luxury, re-
mark upon the ill ﬁt and well worn
appearance of the Panther’s’ attire.
Dean H. E. Friesell, of the Dental
School, will aid the cause. He has
offered to scour New York for the
silkiest, sleekest Panther outﬁt avail-
able, Then, when the Pan.the.r bursts
forth in new ﬁnery, can the students
rest at ease in the assurance of an
up-to-date, immaculate Panther.
First Panther Appeared in 1901

The. ﬁrst Panther suit was pur-
chased in 1901 by Bert "Smye,i's, ’98,
prominent alumnus. Later the ‘stu-
dents bought the outiit as a tribute
to the athletic. teams’ mascot. The
last outﬁt, now five years old, was a
contribution of the Dental School.
Probably, with the Panther suit at
the advanced age of five years, the
adjective “nioth—eaten” is not ill ap-
plied, after all.

The cost of the last suit was ap-
proximately $250, but next week Dean
Friesell will visit tliea‘n;rical costum-
in New York.
hoping to purchase one for much less. 1

Collection Booths to Be Set Up
"WSGA and Student Council have
arranged to set up booths for collec-
tions from lVednesday through Friday
of next week. Booths will be set up

in Alumni Hall, the Cathedra.l, the
Inﬁrmary, . and the Engineering
School. The dental students have al-

ready pledged 100 per cent towards
contribution, as well as many of the
engineers. Arthur Goldberg, Col. ’33,
chairman of the student traditions
committee, is in charge of arrange-

As now planned, in the future there
will be a whole family of Panthers
instead of just -one. The family
sporting on the ﬁeld should add zest
to any tilt. The ﬁrst appearance of
the new Panther, perhaps the family,
will be at the Pitt-Carnegie Tech
game on November 19.

To insure the University of a fam-
ily of Panthers, one instructor has
offered to buy one suit, another fac-
ulty member has expressed his will-
ingness to pay for a second, and a
campus organization has promised to
donate a third.

Few Jobs.FiIIed Through

Women ’s Work Bureau

 

Despite the fact that a large num-
ber of women on the campus desire

available through the ofﬁce of the dean
of women.

Miss Isabelle Anderson, assistant to
the dean, and in charge of placing
these women, says that only a very
few Calls have come to her offering
to hire student employes. Only ex-
cellent steiiographers have been of-
fered employment, in return for which
they are to receive. partial tuition.

There is very little opportunity for

Council to Pay Football
Holiday Damages

Four students, self-styled “victims
of circumstances” in‘ Monday’s pep
demonstration in the Golden’ Trian-
gle, today were still relating the
events wliich led to their arrest, in-

a hearing before Magistrate Jones in
Morals Court Tuesday morning.

Homer Colli.ns., Eng. ’33, Robert
McClure, Col. ?36, and Hyman Pober,
Col. '35, were dismissed with a good-
natured reprimand that calling an
officer such names as “ﬂatfoot” and
“ra.t”—-although the latter appellation
was said to have been meant for
the complainant’s liorse—was hardly
a way of showing the friendship that
exists between the police and stu-
dents.

M. A, Rosenbloom, Col. ’33, alleged
to have broken the glass in a lobby
door of a downtown theater, was dis-

missed after the University had suc- ‘

ceeded in having the charges against
him dropped. Student Council, who
declared the day a football holiday,
will pay the damages connected with
the demonstration —— probably about
$20. This ﬁgure includes the dam-
ages caused when a group of students
dumped nine cases of pop from a bev-
erage truck that was parked along
their line of march.

At Games

In a letter to C01. E. J. Cullen,
Chancellor John G. Bowman compli-
mented the Pitt Band on its excellent

showing on the ﬁeld at the" football
games. He expressed himself pleased
with the spirit with which the mem-
bers carry themselves and as deeply
affected that the members cared
enough -about the prestige of the Uni-
versity to attend the many drills that
must have been required of them to
'atta.i’n'”a' degree" of" marching ability
comparable to that of even Ohio-
State, probably the best competition
in the country.

Below is the context of the Chan-
cel1or’s letter:

“Let me say a..word to you
which I think is much merited
about the Pitt Band. In march-
ing abiiity on the field they have
compared favorably with their
best competition, even Ohio
State. They carry themselves
with a spirit which is excellent.
All of this means, I am sure, that
the members of the band have
attended many extra drills and
that they really care about _the
prestige of "the "University. This
feeling goes deep into me. I wish
that in some way you could con-
vey to the members of the Pitt
Band how their fine spirit. ap-
pears to one who sits on the side-
lines.”

THE PITT NEWS

Gossip Taboo In Indian Schools

Indian Student Must Wash His Teacher's Feet, Put Him
to Bed, Keep Step with Him, but Not Obey Him

 

“You must wash your teacher's feet
and put him to bed when it is time
to retire. If your teacher walks, youl
shall walk; but ifhe runs, see that
you run also. You shall never ap-
proach your teacher with shoes on
your feet, nor with your head covered
in any manner.” These are only three
of the rules you would have to obey,
were you a student in India.

Dr, ‘W. A. Lunden, of the sociology
clepartmeiit, has made a collection of
the rules which students in India fol-
low. For instance, it is not expected
that a. Pitt student will obey his teach-
er in everything, whereas he who
seeks an education in India is to obey
his prof in everything unless com-
manded to commit a crime.

There are a few rules, however,
which might work well on the campus
of such a university as Pitt. In In-
dia one’s best friend does not have
to tell him, for he is warned against
eating pungent condiments. Sleeping
in classes is prevented by the order
that no student shall sleep in the day-
time. Strange to say, nothing is said

Meda, Freshman Women’s
Honorary, Plans Meetings

Genevieve Blatt, senior chairman of
Meda, announced plans for a. series of
regular monthly meetings, at the
second fall meeting of that organiza
tion, Tuesday afternoon, in Heinz
House.

The Meda group is composed of all
women who have ranked in the high-
est ten per cent in freshman achieve-
ment and intelligence tests and. have,
achieved one quality point scliolasticl
averages in their first semesters!
work. The organization exists for the,
sole purpose of bringing into sociali
contact women recognized in their
freshmlan year for superior attain-l
ment and involves no formal organi-1
zation, pin, nor dues. I

M. P, Chworowsky, principal of the,
Fanny Ede] Falk Elementary School,l
spoke to Meda members on the pur-',
poses and plan of the experimental;
school, at Tuesday’s meeting.

about cutting classes, though the stu-
dent is urged to keep his mind upon
his lessons constantly -and to=go over
the passages which he has not com-
mitted thoroughly, during the time
when he is suposed to rest. Nothing
is said about how well this rule works.

Affectation is taboo even in India,
where the seeker after knowledge
must not use perfume, nor embellish
himself. !

Gossiping is another thing against
which he is warned. No one is put on
‘the pan, and no matter what one
knows about the girl next door, one
does not dish out the dirt. An-d, speak-
ing of girls, he must not walk with
girls unless purpose requires. “Pur-
pose” is not deﬁned.

Nevertheless the Indian college man
has his privileges as well as his re-
strictions. When the teacher makes
a mista.ke, he may go to him after
class and tell him about it. The teacli—
er inust love his student like a son
and teach him to the best of his
ability. If he neglects the pupil he
is no longer considered worthy of the
position of teacher.

Sutherland Favored to Win
in Clash of Warner System
Exponents in Penn Contest

 

But Jock Believes Quakers Will be Pointing tor Panthers;
Pitt Players to Stay at Merchants Country Club

Until a Few Hours

“Saturday’s game will be the biggest game on Pennsylvania’s
-schedule this fall,” was the comment of Jock Sutherland, as he
boarded the train last evening at the Union Station for Philadelphia.

“Penn has not had to extend itself in either the Dartmouth
or Navy games, and only the coaches and players themselves know

their real power. It is doubtful how the Panthers are going to func-
tion, because they have met tests on the last ﬁve consecutive

L
V

Sntii1‘dayS.

“We feel Penn will be stuﬁing for
us,” was the doctor's parting as the‘
train pulled slowly away from the
station carrying its quota of thirty-
four players representing the Univer-
sity who are to carry the blue and
gold colors on Franklin Field Satur-
day afternoon against Harvey Har-
man’s Penn Blues.

Warner vs. Warner

A peculiarity of that game tomor-
row will be the fact that a western
Pitt will be playing an eastern Pitt.
The game will resolve itself into a
contest to prove which part of the
state has been -better tutored in the
fundamentals left by its progenitor,
one “Pop” Vvarner.

Jock and Harvey have both been
pupils of that football sage, a.nd are
both using his system of offensive
and defensive playing. Sutherland
played under Warner in 1918, while
Harman played on the varsity at Pitt
in 1919, 20, and 21. Not only that,
but Harman’s line coach, Alex Fox,
was tutored in the Warner system
under Sutherland in 1928.

Of course, there’s no getting around
the fact that Pitt is being favored to
take Saturday's game, and in doing so
give the Quakers one of the worst
trouncings they liave had in years.
Not so many days in the past you
were probably reading that Notre
Dame was likewise expected to give
Pitt a beating long to be remembered.
But if you read Sunday’s newspapers,
and even today's, you will remember
that columns were written of the de-
molition of Hunk Anderso11’s Irish
Ramblers.

Penn More Successful

On the face of things, Penn has had
a more successful season, to this day, I
than has had Pitt. The Quakers have 
turned in victories against Franklin-I
Mars-lial.l. Swathmore, Lehigh, Dart-'.
mouth. and Navy for their alma. ma-I
ter——all but the Dartmouth game,
sizeable victories. ' ‘ ”

Pitt, on the other hand, with com-

parative ease, mopped up Ohio North-.
ern, West Virginia, and Duquesne,
but against Army. Ohio State, and
Notre Dame the Panthers had more
than their sha.re of opposition.
‘ Injuries have added to the trou-
bles of the Panthers. although for the
Penn ga.me they will be in a better
condition than for any of their pre-
vious games this year.

Hogan, Tormey, and VVei11st0ck,
ailing during the past three games,
are on the mend. Mungas will prob-
ably start at quarterback in place of
Hogan, with the latter taking a turn
during one of the quarters.

Sebastian has won a regular berth
on the Panther's varsity squad and
will be Hel1er’s partner in the half-
back positions. With 'Weisenbaugh
starting at full. the backﬁeld is now
announced for Saturday’s game.

Daily and Skladany, Cuba and Wal-
ton, Hartwig and Onder, with Tormey
at center will be Pitt's forward wall
against Penn.

So much for the Panthers.

V Penn Has Kickers

Regardless of the punting ability of
Hogan and Mungas, Penn believes
that in Don Kellet and Carl Perina,
halfback and fullback, it will have
more k.ickin.£r ability. Kellet gave a
masterful exhibition in the Navy
game when he kicked frmr times out
of bounds inside the 10-yard line.
Perina, 205-pound back, is a longer
punter but cannot place his punts as
well.

The same li.neup that entered the
Navy battle will start tomorrow’s
game for Penn. Joe Burnett and Mel
Memeon, ends; Captain Stan Sokolis
and--Howie Colehower, tackles"; Did-“
die VVilson and Frank Yablonski,
guards, and Roy Engle, center.

Penn’s backﬁeld will be: Eddie Ma-
savage, quarterback; Don Kellet and
Ed Lewis, halfbacks, and Carl Pe-
rina, fullback.

Panthers in Seclusion

Upon the arrival of the Golden
Panthers this morning in the Quaker
City, they will repair immediately to
the Merchants. Country Club,-at Or-.
land, where a scrimmage is called for
this afternoon. The tea.m will “be
quartered in seclusion until it leaves
for the Franklin Field bowl. a few
hours before game time, arriving atl
the ﬁeld in time to dress and a few!
minutes’ rest preceding the starter’s
whistle at 2 o'clock.

Ta.king a tip from Hunk Anderson.
Jock Sutherland will not permit his
proteges to peruse any newspapers!
before the start of tomorrow’s game.
Anderson blamed the newspaper re-
ports for aiding in a erreat measure in
the Irish defeat at the Stadium, but
the canny Scot has decided that no
such alibi will have to be presented
after this game is over.

But within 36 hours one team in
Pennsylvania will not be found among
those in the undefeated list.

Fresh Eleven

Meets Kiski

Unbeaten Cubs Favored to End
Season With Victory

 

season confronts the freshman foot-
ball team as it clashes with Kiski at
Kiski tonight.

Long the home of embryo collegiate
"grid stars, Kiski has suffered a de-
cided reversal of form and this year’s
team has not measured up to the
standard set in previous years. De-
feated by the W&J frosh and the
Navy Plebes, the Kiski boys have not
shown much promise.

The Pitt fresiimen, on the other
hand, have remained un-defeated and
untied despite the efforts of Wyoming
Seminary and the fresh teams of
Carnegie Tech, Penn State and West
Virginia.

Coach Gougler has quite a bit of
material to choose from but will like-

Coach Sutherland’s main job for
this week seems to be to prevent the
Pitt team from becoming over-conﬁ-
dent and excessively optimistic. After
the dope bucket was so rudely upset

in the Notre Dame game last week,.

the Panthers would be foolish indeed
to take any of their remaining games

too lightly.

After word had gotten out that
Pitt had; defeated Notre Dame,
Jock Sutherland was the recipient
of hundreds of telegrams and
phone calls from alumni, other
coaches, players and ma-ny movie
stars, much to the delight of the
AT&T.

It seems that the students a-t Penn
do not like to see Notre Dame come
to town, as the Irish have a habit of
running up high scores on the paciﬁc
Quakers. Last year the score was
only forty-nine -to seven. Therefore,
when the mere handful of seventy
thousand people who attended the
Penn-Navy game last week heard the
score of twelve to nothing, they dis-
regarded the game before them and
cheered the Panthers for -the better
part of ﬁve minutes.

Strange as it seems, they are
not likely to repeat the process to-
morrow, if the Panthers manage
to slide over a touchdown or two.
The game tomorrow is expected to

ﬁll the stadium. at Franklin Field.
That means ‘a matter of eighty thou-
sand people and oh! so much dough.

Since there is one date still
open on the Panther’s football
schedule for next year, the boys

at dear old WNU (Western News-

paper Union to you) would like a

game. “We can beat the Panthers

with one hand," seem-s to be the
opinion of the majority at the in-
stitution_

VVNU is located in the heart of Pitts-
burgh and has, in addition to- the
parent institution, thirty-six branches
of higher learning. In case the Ath-

letic Council is interested, they should
call Mike at the WNU. (How about
a cut, Charley?)

Continuing, in a serious vein, all
credit must be given to the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania for a very
efficientpubiicity department. A
call for information that was sent
out Friday brought a batch of mail
in on Tuesday. Information on
the footballers was so complete
that I can’t understand why the
color of their hair and eyes was
not given.

After all the different stories that
the downtown papers carried on the
men who were to help Graham Mc-
Namee in -the broadcast last Saturday,
the ﬁnal choice for the man behind
the throne was a, former Campus
Scout of the Pitt weekly.

It ‘really seems funny that Pitt
should wait so long to show some
real -school spirit. Now it seems
to realize just what school spirit
is and what it has missed by not
displaying it previuusly,

Most colleges, especial-1y those in
the vicinity, could take many lessons
in school spirit from the city’s high
schools. Even when their team has
no possible chance of winning, the
high school students don’-t desert.

Carnegie Tech and Duquesne
students, who have displayed what
little spirit was present in this
district, lost some of their pres-
tige by refusing to take up the
challenge of the Pitt paraders for
a “conference.” Yeah! Man!

The cross-country team fell down
quite a lot over the week-end. After
displaying promise of turning into a
world beater, the team fell, once again
before the Penn State harrier.s. How-
ever, the freshies managed to defeat
the Lion cubs.

If Penn defeats Pitt‘ tomorrow
a “Rowbottom” will be called if
this column has to do the calling.
Yeah,

If you should chance to look

Saturday's Aftermath

LOOI{ING back on Monday ’s pep demonstration, which ended with
four students being jailed for alleged disturbances of the peace,
we ﬁnd none of the traces of the bitterness and ill feeling that has
followed such incidents in the past.

Apparently the exuberance that -was responsible for the hila-

rious invasion of downtown Pittsburgh was felt in some measure by
persons other than the “rioters” themselves. The spirit generated
by the victory over Notre Dame was carried out of the Stadium by
thousands of Pitt followers, and, by all reports, was manifested in
the reception accorded the celebrating students in the Golden Tri-
angle‘, -
Police intervention came only after it appeared that some prop-
erty damage might result from the movements of the throng. And
it is signiﬁcant to note that, contrary to precedent, there was no at-
tempt by police to halt the parade because a permit had not been
issued covering the demonstration. «

There can hardly be anyone who would not agree that the cir-
cumstances of the football victory justiﬁed the disturbance, which
was, after all, a comparatively mild affair. Student Council took
the responsiblity of declaring the day a holiday, and Student Coun-
cil since has taken the responsibility of paying for the damages that
resulted.

Council’s action, however, cannot be taken as suiﬁcient,justiﬁ—

cation for staging an off—campus demonstration every time Dr. Suth-‘g
There is no reason why

erland’s football team wins another game.
the privilege should be abused. .

Little more need be said about the incident, which, we believe,
had the sympathy of every normal, spirited friend of the Univer-
sity from the beginning. '

I Pre - Election Analysis
ADHERENTS of the several political parties, both voting and non-
voting students, may have their political convictions strength-
ened or changed by the arguments that will _be presented tonight
in the Schenley High school auditoriuni onthe ‘program of the Uni-
versity Political Symposium. --  ~-‘ " ,

The cases for the three major candidates——Republican, Demo-
crat and Socialist—will be reduced, perhaps, to their actual mean-
ings by the logical debate of six speakers representing Princeton,
Pitt and the University of Virginia. The lesser contenders for pres-
idential honors, however, none of whom is conceded a chance of
being elected, will not be neglected on the symposium program.
Following the scheduled discussion of Hoover, Roosevelt and Thom-
as, and their platforms, members of the audience may present and
discuss the qualiﬁcations of the minor candidates.

Sponsored by the Allegheny ‘County League of "Women Voters,
the symposium is intended to be a fair and analytical discussion of
the men who‘ seek office in the highest governmental position the
country has to offer, and of the stands these men have taken or
failed to take on the issues of the day. It is not intended to be the
kind of stereotyped campaign dogma that one may read in the bul-
letins published by the nationa.l committees of the three parties. To-
night’s discussion is to be the logical presentation of the -student
point of view with regard to national politics.

Coming almost on the eve of election day, the symposium has
aroused considerable interest among the intelligent, serious—1ninded
students at the University. It will have no eﬁect on the outcome of
next Tuesday’s election. It may result in the exchange of a few
political souls between parties, but it will not keep either Mr. Hoov-
er, Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. Thomas from donning the silk hat on in-
auguration day, if their respective followers so ordain.

VVith each of the major candidates claiming an interest in the
“youth of America,” our small section of that sadly misunderstood
group may have a last—minute opportunity tonight to learn whether
that interest exists as fact or as only another “talking point” of
campaign oratory. * .

. (hallrrg

By Don Early

 

Modern literature is full of false
cries, misdirected movements, vague
esthetics, and it is marked by such a
general lack of unity in purpose and
technique, that frequently we have
felt at a standstill concerning its fu-
ture. And small wonder—what with

the Great American Novel appearing
once a month, with every poet who

has a slim volume to his credit or
discredit a meistersinger in his own
right, and with critics who insist that
writers like Gertrude Stein open the
way to .a new, more direct literary

perfection, What are our standards,
we ask ourselves? Or, what is more

awful, can we ever have any stand-
ards?

Already some mist of the confusion
is trailing oif. The cult of the nu-
merous “iSmS” is less noisy these
days, either because its disciples have
ism-ized their writings to a halting
point or because the younger genera-
tion oﬁers fewer converts. This last
is signiﬁcant. For certainly we have
a. growing body of young writers who
prefer to be called practitioners rath-
er than theorists, who are trying to
communicate intelligently, and who

are showing some regard for literary
principles which have been respected
since Homer. ‘In other words, it looks
as though a certain amount of assur-
ance and stability is creeping in. -
Sincerity, Authenticity, and Passion

The first issue of the American
Spectator conﬁrms this strongly.
There are always new literary maga-
zines on the book stands, each with
its theories and tenets. But the Spec-
tator implies no theory and advances
no startling ideas other than the un-
usual one'of, literary open-mindedness
and a restatement of the foundamen-
ta.l principles of sincerity, authentic-
ity,_ and passion.

It is ‘no “modern” affair. in any
sense, unless, we choose to regard
modern that 5 which directs intelli-
gently and expresses and satisﬁes the
needs of a situation. For this the
American Sp’ectator does. It particu-
larly deprecates erratic ventures and
brings to the consideration of litera-
‘,_ture a soun_cln_ess, open-mindedness,
’and intelligentniiderstaiiding of liter-
ary principles which really look like
agleam through the darkest confu-
sion of letters the world, no doubt,
has seen. And we nominate the edi-
tors, Mr. Nathan, Mr. Ernest Boyd,
Mr. -Dreiser, Mr. Cabell, and Mr.
O’Neil1, all to the November gallery
of the Famed-of-tlie-Month Club.

““ Medly in Tauromania

A discussion of literary principles
makes us wonder about Ernest Hem-
ingway-’s new venture, “Death in the
Afternoon.” It looks as though he
has again done something interesting,
this time as combined novelist, phil-
osopher, and ardent tauromaniac.
Hemingway ﬂatters us_Americans in
what he thinks is our interest and
knowledge of the bull ring, and we
would doubtlessly. ﬁnd the book im-
mensely interesting if we could live
a year or two in Spain or even get at
what Hemingway is saying. The first
half of the book is devoted to a. de-
scription of bull ﬁghts, bull ﬁghters
and philosophical excursions on
death, while the second -half consists
of photographs and a glossary to ex-
plain what he has said.

One interesting comment that
comes out in Hemingway’s justiﬁca-
tion of the book is this‘: ‘ '

“The only place where you could
see life and death, i. e., violent death.
now that the wars were over, was in
the bull ring.”

One feels Hemingway is trying to
recapture the stirring ‘post-war feel-
ing that made “A Farewell to Arms”
such a ﬁne piece "of ‘work, a sort of
deliberate projection of himself into
a situation where something akin to
this might be.had. A story of the
bull ring would suit us well, but most
of us are not likely to enjoy such a
technical exposition.

Hear Attack
On Capitalism

 

Van Essen, Sociailist, Talks
to Inquiry Forum

...—..._

Dr. William J. Van Essen, Socialist
candidate for United States Senator
from Pennsylvania, addressed the In-
quiry Forum last Wednesday afternoon
on “The Case for the Socialists.”

“Capitalism has outlived its useful-
ness,“ Dr. Van Essen pointed out. “Its
most notorious feature is its lack of
a planned economy and industrial an-
archy and ruinous competition are
wrecking our economic structure.”

Socialism, according to the speaker,
attempts to return industry to the peo-
ple. The senatorial candidate empha-
sized that inequitable distribution un-
der socialized organizations would be
impossible. He further stressed “This
depression will last until socialism is
adopted.”

“Because of capitalism the world is
now in the greatest chaos of its his-
tory,” he continued. “The World War,
itself due to capitalistic greed, has
plunged every nation into severe de-
pressions. Unemployment and out»-
breaks of violence have been inevi-
table.”

PITT BITS

(Continued From Page Three)
closely through the program that
is distributed at the games (for
two bits) you may notice a start-
ling resemblance between Frank
Walton and Izzy Weinstock. One
resemblance not shown in the
program is that both boys are
plenty goo-d.

Fairy Tale for Today: “There is a
riot-like custom that is in force at
Penn called “The Rowbottom. When
the students are under the control of
said Rowb-ottom, they l-o-se all sense
of everything, and begin to throw
any article in sight. Bullets are sup-
posed to play a part in this game,
through the courtesy of the Philadel-
phia police department.” End of quote.

Pitt should be heavily represented
tomorrow at Philadelphia, but those
who intend to stay over Sunday should
remember the Blue Laws.

Freshmen Win

  Swim Honors

Lindberg, Chambers Capture
Free Style Championships

Russel Lin-dberg and Chuck Cham-
bers, member of Pitt’s freshman
swimming team, gathered the top
honors in the two AMA champion-
ships decided in the Keystone Ath-
letic club pool VVedn.esday night.

Lindberg captured the senior 100-
yard free-style championship, and
Chambers won the junior 50-yard
free-style title. The ﬁeld for both
events was so large that the winners
had to swim heats, semi-ﬁnals, and
ﬁnals.

.Lindberg’s time for the hundred
was 55.4, two tenths_of  a second
slower than the present AMA re-cord
which was set in a faster; 6-0-foot
pool. Chambers clipped geight-tenths
-of a second off’ the standing record
for the junior ﬁfty-yard distance, win-
ning in the excellent time of 25.3. V

The entire meet was dominated by
Pitt swimmers. Herman Adlersberg.
team captain, and Jack Denny of the
varsity, ﬁnished second and third re-
spectively behind Lindberg. Finish-
ing behind Chambers were Bill Lewis
of the Pitt varsity, and. Miller, Carne-
Le-wis’ time of 26.1 in
his heat equalled the present record.
