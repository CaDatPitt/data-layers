N ew Policies

The Pittsburgh Commission on
Fair Employment Practices has
announced the policies to _be fol-
lowed under that commission.

Information supplied to the Pitt
News by Louis Mason Jr., assist-
ant administrator for FEPC, points
out that “discrimination in em-
ployment creates unrest, unjustly
condemns large groups P to de-
pressed living conditions, reduces
the public revenues, and imposes
unnecessary ﬁnancial b u r d e n s

upon the public for the relief of
the conditions so created.”

It also forbids discriminatory
advertisements, segregation in em-

ployment or the use of _a quota

system. Under the ordinance
(No. 465) it is unlawful for an
employer to refuse to hire a per-

_son or refer him to jobs because

of_ race, color, religion, national
ancestry, and place of birth.

'Mr. Mason asked that any stu-,
dents seeking employment and

anyof the reasons outlined in the
law may obtain speciﬁc and de-
tailed information ‘in room 518,
City-C\ounty Building.”

Some routes, naturally, are longer‘ than
others. But if there is less trafhc on them,
they might get you to Kankakce faster.

The same holds true of your Long
Distance calls. When circuits are tempo-
rarily busy on the most direct route for
your call, a new electronic brain in the
-telephone oﬂice automatically selects alter-

, nate routes. They may be hundreds of
' miles longer, but the detour saves you time.

And the entire operation of selection.
_and rerouting is done in a split second! .

The Bell System people who perfected,
maintain and operate this electronic
switching system have one goal: to make
the best telephone service in the worl.d
even better. Would youlike to join this
competent, aggressive team?

There are many opportunities in the“
Bell System—in engineering, business ad-_
" ministration, accounting, and other ﬁelds.
Your Placement Oﬂiceiﬁcan give you the

‘ and ‘now it is time for us to accept our responsibilities and
 make a place for ourselves. We entered Pitt as fun-loving
fellows and girls and now, still eager and spirited, we leave

. college men and‘ women. Perhaps you may wonder what
we have learned, what we have experienced, and what we
have endeared to our hearts. There is so much of you to

__ love, Alma Mater. Whether we realize it or not, your tall
columns and your magniﬁcent heights have inspired us to

lofty thoughts and high moments. Your lovely Chapel has

brought us desired peace and communion with something

“or someone greater than all of us. Your impressive me-
morial to Stephen Foster brings back the rhythmic move-
mentsof the Darkies swaying and humming to the sweet

J‘ » _melodies of Foster." The libraries bring still other remind-

‘ ers of hard work, with perhaps some cramming, the muﬁied
voices, the .helpful librarians,-"and the sleeping scholars.
The work, and hopes, and dreams -of many people are ‘ex-
pressed in our beloved Nationality Rooms. In any class-
-room,'. whether it" be in Alumni Hall, or an unﬁnished one

' ~ on the seventh ﬂoor,‘ or a beautifully decorated Nationality‘ .
‘ ., Room, we have learned. We have learned from our -books,

- from our. professors and instructors, and‘from our class-

- ‘mates.’ We have studied for many years andyet we real-
.‘"ize that we have barely scratched‘ the surface. This is a
“good sign!‘ Weremember the_.fun and the smoke in the

’ Tuck Shops and registration in the Cafeteria. We remember

Next fall willsee a new tradi-

this tradition isn’t one that forces
anybody to do anything, . like

people from doing something,

Finally, stu-

upon a custom
that, because
it is non-re-
strictive, will

the most pop-

I was rather disappointed the
other evening when the curtain
at the Nixon was lowered on the
ﬁnal act of “Mrs. McThing,”
starring the great lady of the
American 1 stage, Helen. Hayes.
After_reading its praises by the
New York critics, Ilwas expect-
ing another' magniﬁcent p fantasy
from the author, Mary Chase, as
“Harvey”'had been.

Many will argue that it should

“' not becompared to the story of

Elwood~P. Dowd and his invisi-
ble rabbit friend, a wonderful

_ adultplay, since “Mrs. McThing”

was written to include entertain-
ment for the children as well as
adult audiences. _ » *
Youngsters in Top Roles

This is undoubtedly true, since
the cast features in major sup-
porting’-roles two members whose
ages are somewhereiin the neigh-
borhood of :ten. Also, the typical
children ingredientsbf mobsters
and witchcraft are the. basis of
the comedy fantasy.

I shall try to extol the virtues
of “Mrs. .McThing”.without be-
ing prejudiced after having seen

and never forgotten “Harvey.” 11:. ‘

Conceived by "Druids

The event is the premier of the
official Pitt coat, a’ quality, blue,
blazer type sport coat encrested
with the-Seal of the University.
The coat will be sold for about
twenty dollars and will be tail-
ored to each student who buys
one by a well -known Pittsburgh
haberdasher‘.

already met with the enthusiastic

The story begins at the majes-.
tic and ornate home of Mrs. How-
ard U. Larue III. Mrs. Larue is
puzzled about her son’s recent
behavior. He has changed from
the usual rude, cowboy and gang-
ster loving boy of ten to a per-
fect little gentleman.

Enter the Witch

Her maid plants the suggestion
in her mind that a\woman, Mrs.
,McThing, who is» believed to be
a witch, is the cause of this, as

Mrs. Larue refused to allow her‘

daughters to play ‘with I-loway.
This is indeed ‘the cause; the

witch has spirited the boy away,

and substituted a living and iden-
tical “stick”, a» clever product of
witchcraft. . ,

After ﬁnding the real Howay,
who ‘has now joined a mob’ of
assorted zcreeps headed by “Poi-
son Eddie” Schellenbach, Mrs.

Larue discovers too late, the‘-

power of Mrs. McThing, for after

of the cafe and calling home for

her car, she ﬁnds the Witchhas _

- Pitt News: ‘ "

Last month the University was
host to the Pennsylvania’ Forensic
and Music League, a State-wide
organization of secondary schools
sponsored since 1927 by the Uni-
versity. .

Each year the State Finals are
conducted in a different city, but
only two previous State festivals
werelheld at the University be-
cause of a feeling that the hos-
pitality .of ' a small community

could, not be matched by a big

city.

The resultof the State Festival
here at Pitt this year has proved
this ‘opinion completely false. The
cooperation of_~Pitt‘students and

faculty to accommodate these

high school students and their

',teachers—t_o‘per‘form the hundred

necessary but menial tasks-was
truly remarkable. -

A Good Advertisement

If the popularity ofa Univer-
sity jacket at other schools is any
indication‘ of the expected suc-
cess 'of_ the coat‘ here, the idea
will become an established tra-
dition in no time at all.

To the man who claims that
Pitt students don’t' have enough

pride in their University to. sport _

a Pitt coat, I should like topoint

out the number of students who i Y
plaster Pitt decals and pictures
over their cars, books and lug-

gage. '
At any rate, the project, is .a
noble one. The coat will certain-

ly spread the name of Pitt when _

groups like the debators go to
other campuses. Publicity in the
Pittsburgh areawill be good too.
The Pitt coat, proudly worn by
proud students can’t help but aid
in placing the name of-Pitt where
it should be, at the top.

Pitt’s baseball Panthers will go into this afternoon’s
clash. with Duquesne a bit more high—hearted than the last

time the two teams met.

from the undefeated ranks to climb another notch in the
ﬁght for district supremacy, and the payoff came Monday
when the NCAA selection committee extended the Panthers

a bid to the District _ 2 playoffsé

Lafayette will be Pitt’s opponent
in the ﬁrst round June ‘3, which
also ﬁnds Penn State facing Ford-

ham. The winners meet the next ‘

day, and the ﬁnal victor goes to
Omaha, Neb., to participate in the
national championship.

Even though the trip comes dur-
ing ﬁnals week, the Panthers are
enthused over the idea. Consider-
able doubt as to their chances of
being picked stemmed from losses
to Navy and‘ Ohio University.

Ten Olsonmen GO to New York
or IC»-{LA Track Meet Friday .

_ By DAVE MAZER .

With probably the best chance "since the war to equal
the ‘top Panther performance, -ten_ of Coach Carl Olson’s
thincladsjourney to the 77th annual IC4A track meet in
New York Friday and Saturday. - _

Fifty-two teams have entered the meet and while Pitt
can’t win because only a skeleton squad is going, the Blue-

and-Gold can match the 12.po’ints.tallied by the 1946 team

in the previous ‘best showing.
Heading the Panther delegation
will be Wally Monahan, who took
a fourth in last season’s'IC4A’s.
The three hurdlers "who beat Mon-
ahan, ‘though, have since gradu-
ated, sonhis chances are favorable
for the 120-yard high hurdles. He
will also be entered in the 220-
yard lows. _ ‘
-Ruschel and Luterancik
. Also competing in the high and
low hurdles will be the Panthers’
one—man gang, Bill Ruschel. The

* blond soph from Washington, Pa.

rolled ,up 11 9 1/3. points. in ﬁve . events

-in the-Panthers 116% to 141/; ob-

literation of Virginia last Friday.

Other individual entries in the
classic include Don Minihan in the
pole vault and Co—captain Bernie
Luterancik in the two-mile run.
Last spring, Luteranciki placed
ﬁfth.

‘ Pitt will also send its mile re-
lay‘ squad of Joe Dudas, Norm
Kutcher, Ray Lee,_ and Bruce Giron
to the championship meet.

“Big-Timers”
Although this will be the Panth-
ers initial visit to New York, Olson

says, “That won’t bother them,
they’re used to big-time competi-
tion.”

Final tabulations on the point
scoring in the dual ‘meets and Penn
Relays showed Monahan the high-
est scorer with 69% tallies. Run-
nerups were Ruschel with 62%
and Kutcher with 401/4. '

Reynolds Plays
F or All-Stars

Billy, Reynolds, three-year sen-
sational halfback for the grid
Panthers, has been invited to
compete in the 20th annual Col-
lege All—Star game on Aug. 14, at
Soldiers Field in Chicago, Ill.

His selection by the classic’s
mastermind, Arch Ward of the
Chicago Tribune, climaxes one of
the most successful careers of a
Pitt gridder. Reynolds is the ﬁrst
Panther to be so honored since
World War II began.‘ - _

Along with ~ 49 other college

vgreats, Reynolds will report for
-training at Purdue University on

July .25. Bobby Dodds of Georgia
Tech will coach the All-Stars, a_

Coach Dave McCormack’s link-
ers extended their winning streak
by pummeling the Dukes as well
as St. Francis in action last week‘.
Their record is now 7-3-1.

After a slow start when they
lost their first threematches, the
golfers met and tied West Virginia.
This proved to be the turning
point for since then they have
rolled over every team to come up
against them.

In the tennis ﬁnale, Coach Jim
Tul1y’s boys hope to register their
seventh triumph of the season.

This afternoon’s matches will
mark the end of college careers for
four tennis stalwarts-—Gene Wein-
stein, Herk Duncan,» Joe Bendel,
