PSA Plans to Operate

Co-op Housing in 2 Years Directors

by BOB BONN

Student co-op housing may be
operating in Panther Hollow with-
in two years if plans made by the’
Pittsburgh Student Asociation
(PSA) proceed on schedule.

According to Lenny Klavonic.
one of Pitt‘s PSA representatives.
"What were attempting to do is
to construct student-owned. stu-
dent-operated. high-rise modern
apartments with two and three-
bedroom units. offering a $25 to
$30 per month reduction in the
rent rates."

    

KLAVONIC

Klavonic explained that,
through the co-operation of all the
city colleges who make up the
PSA, this idea may not be as fan-
tastic as it sounds. ‘

“This term. C—MU is offering
an 18-unit course on student hous-
ing." the former president said.
"This is run by competent author-
ities on housing management. ar-
chitects. lawyers. etc.. who are
helping students to understand
just what is entailed in a housing
operation.

C—MU students will do the ac-
tual designing of the building. A
high-rise structure with restau-
rant facilities on the ground floor
is planned and the surrounding
area will be utilized for parking.

Funding for such a project is
immediately a logical question.
Answered Klavonic, “Right now,
we have a private source of fund-
ing from an insurance concern
which has a $15 million invest-
ment pool for this type of project.

A private corporation would ex-
pect to exercise a certain amount

Applications for positions on
Associated Women Students
(AWS) are now available.
Elections will be held Feb. 10
from 9-5 in the Towers lobby
and the Cathedral.

Applications may be obtain-
ed in the dormitories, at the
Student Union desk, and in
500 SU. They are due by Jan.
28.

Applications for financial aid
may be picked up in the Stu-
dent Aid Office, Room 325,
Schenley Hall, starting Mon-
day.

The deadlines are March 1,

of control over the operation. how-
ever‘. Klavonic explained that
even better source is a federal
grant from HUD (Housing and
Urban Development). A similar
project was successfully under-
taken in Seattle.

Co-operation with the City of
Pittsburgh shouldn't be a problem
either. according to Klavonic.
"This would utilize city-owned
land in Panther Hollow which is
presently untaxable because it is
just lying there unused.”

Depending on the outcome of
the federal grant proposal, con-
struction could begin sometime
next year. “By March or early
April, we should have finalized
plans for construction on the
site,” Klavonic noted.

According to the PSA. there are
three primary reasons for con-
structing the new dorms. First.
rates in the present dormitories
are very high. considering the
residents have only one room and
are not in an apartment-type sit-
uation.

Secondly. apartment rates in
Oakland are very high and a stu-
dent-managed structure could.
keep the cost to a minimum.

And finally, this project is seen
by some as an alternative to the
Hillside Dorms.

Salary Raises Planned '

Housing Rates May Go Up

by POHLA SMITH

The University Housing Office
will not be able to meet current
expenses without a minimal raise
in housing rates. if Local 29 of the
Service Employees International
Union ratifies the recent’ contract
offer made by the University.
stated John Vrana. director of
University Housing.

Vrana explained that the raises
in pay and the additional‘ fringe
benefits offered to employees
would cost the housing office an
additional $500,000 in remunera-
tions to its housing employees

over a three-year period if the

contract is accepted.

The contract would be retroac-
tive to Jan. 1 of this year. Vrana
explained that this would put a
strain on the budget which ex-
pires June 30.

“It is going to be tight until June
30,” said Vrana. “We will be
counting our pennies. However,
we hope to make our present bud-
get.

"There is no way we can go
from June 1 to June 1 without
some raises in rates. However.
we wish to keep the increase at
minimal levels.“

The raise in rates would be ef-
fective as of next September.
Vrana added that the increase in
housing costs still would not cov-
er all of housings expenses.

“We're going to have to effect
other economies in our opera-
tion,” said Vrana. “It’s not our

-intention to try to‘-reduce serv-- l
‘ ‘ ~.th‘e ‘adrr‘i’rnistrati0n. ‘due-

1‘-

ices‘..”_~g _-

     

  

Rather. the housing director ex-
plained that the Housing Office
will have to reduce such things as
the amount of supplies it buys and
find more economic methods of
doing things.

In addition. Vrana listed the
various bills that must be paid
by student housing fees. The larg-
est part of the money goes to pay-
ing off the mortgages of the vari-

GS Committees for Activities, 
Educational Review Organized 

Students from the School of
General Studies (GS) met Mon-
day to discuss the organization of
Student Government (SG) com-
mittees. '

Created was an Education Re-
view Committee designed to ex’-
amine course content. curriculum
and faculty enlargement.

Also formed was an Activities
Committee planned. as Hank
Burns. GS SG president. explain-
ed. "to provide meaningful social
programs. including relevant
speakers for our students."

Burns mentioned that a
“strange hostility between ad-
ministrators and students” was
presently hampering SG activity.

The friction. he declared. orig-
inated over two factors. Burns
enumerated: "First. there is an
unfavorable ratio of GS faculty

professors to students. a very.
sparse offering of new courses: .

and secondly. there is at present

a very tenuous arrangement .with J
to the-

q.

 

Sharing the dual directorship
will be Robert Lederman. cur-
rent business manager of the Pitt
News, and Doug Browning, a for-
mer SG senator and a member of
the BAS Steering Committee.

According to SA Commissioner
Wade Lawson. the job of the fi-
nance director will be divided into
two areas.

Lederman will be responsible
for auditing and budget manage-

ment, which is similar to his job V

on the Pitt News. His duties will
include the maintenance of all fi-
nancial records, budget research,
budget efficiency and the counter-
signing of all budgetary requests
by the commissioners.

Although all decisions and rec-
ommendations will be made joint-
ly by the directors. Browning will
be primarily concerned with bud-
get review. He will review on a
monthly basis the budgets of ev-
ery organization which receives
an SA allocation.

Under the new finance direc-
tors. there will be a monthly bud-

ous dormitories. The remainder
goes for salaries. supplies. util-
ities, and upkeep.

He pointed out that his office
“receives no subsidy from the
University. Total expenses must
be covered by our funds.”

Vrana says that he approves of

the contract offer. "The em-
ployees deserve a raise. "

fact that there is only an acting
dean. Nothing we can accomplish
is permanent.“

Elaborating on these points,
Burns charged that both the stu-
dents and administrators “hold
different conceptions of what ef-
fective change really is" and that
the students cannot be satisfied by

The Panther Hollow parking lot
will soon be reopened to students,
if negotiations between the Uni-
versity and the B&O Railroad are

successful.

Many commuters have been in-
convenienced by warning tags
and, more recently, fines for
parking in the lot owned by the

7 railroad.

A In the past the lot has been leas— -

g ed from the railroad by the Uni-

 versity for student parking; the
last lease expired last May.

. After consultation with the B&0
real estate office, Tom Gainan,
vice-president of the Commuter

1 Association, stated, “The Uni- ‘
, versity has been negotiating for

the lease for a long time. Howe-
ever, they (the negotiations) were
broken off mutually sometime in

_ the middle of the summer.”

The main impasse appears to

. concern an insurance problem.

dealing with. the railroad‘s liabil-

ity for theft and damage to cars.

David Smith, University treas-

l'urer, explained, “The railroad is

negotiating for a standard lease

H which includes clauses that would

hold them harmless. The insur-
ance company the University
deals with will not provide cover
for the inclusions. But I think we

V have the problem solved."

According to Gainan, negotia-

tions were reopened last week, a
. and all reports look promising.

However, four or five weeks will

Nominations are now being solicited by the
College of Arts and Sciences for Faculty and
Students to serve on the Committee to grant
the Distinguished Teaching Awards for 1971.
Any member of the University Community who
wishes to submit a nominationvshould do so in

writing, and send it to the College of Arts and

definitely decided. The delay is
due to the many clarifications
which the B&O railroad must re-
ceive from its offices.

In the meantime, the Commuter
Association has been tagging the
violators’ car itself in an effort
to prevent future towing.

“The 8&0 police don‘t want to
tow cars because they don‘t want
to alienate people. So far they
have given warning tags and have
recently, started giving fines."
remarked Gainan.

Offering his views on Universi-
ty nomination, Dennis Concilla.
recently elected Programming
Commissioner stated. "The ad-
ministration is actually very sel-
fish. ,I think that in order to avoid
rocking the boat they are giving
the students the short end of the
deal."

Concilla, already a veteran in
University politics. has two years
experience. including such di-
verse tasks of Student Govern-
ment director of Public Relations.
a member of the Residence Hall
Advisory Board, and treasurer of
the Men's Dorm Council.

Declaring that “the University‘s
primary -purpose is educating the
students." Concilla asked. “Why
is it that the administration's so-
cial budget runs into tens of thou-
sands of dollars when such large
sums couldeasily be channeled to
student needs?"

Budgeting the various depart-
ments should come first,” he con-
tinued, “instead of verting poten-
tially useful funds to something as
ridiculous as a Christmas tree in
the Student Union.”

» Concilla intends to circulate for
student approval a list_of probable

plans in ballot form. Students

would indicate which ones they
would like to see operative. en-
abling the Commissioners to bet-
ter gauge and fulfill student
needs.

The general idea is that the var-
ious campus organizations would
be directly involved in the crea-
tion of such a list in order to “get
everyone into the act."

Regarding the election, Concil-
la offered a somewhat different

perspective than -his original
view. “Though it was basically a
clean election/’\ he explained,
“the election code was overly re-

« strictive and disenfranchised too

many potential voters.”

Hopeful of alleviating such prob-
lems in the future. Concilla pro-
posed that a new voting method.
for example a plastic IBM card is-
sued at Freshman Orientation
that would merely have to be val-
idated in order to vote, might sub-
stantially reduce the ,“typically
complicated situations that devel-
op from the University's elec-
tions.".

The Paul Taylor Dance Con- -
cert will be presented this Sat-
urday at 8:40 p.m. in the Syria
Mosque. This evening of mod-
ern dance is open» to the public
with tickets priced from $3-
$6. This Thursday, a member
of the dance troupe will pre-
sent a lecture at 4:30 ‘p.m. in

ning at 8:30 in the Dance Stu-
dio. All three events are spon-
sored by the Pittsburgh Dance

Clarifying the recent issues of
student insurance and the Univer-
sity Travel Service. Concilla in-
ferred that the University may
not have been getting the best deal
possible for students. He stated.
"It is mandatory for all Universi-
ty traveling needs to be handled
by the University Travel Service.
even though other agencies may
offer cheaper rates."

Concerning insurance, Concilla
referred to a possible co-opera-

'tive student insurance arrange-

ment between all University stu-

dents in the city that would result

in substantially lower rates, along
with the benefit of expanded cov-
erage.

Concluding. Concilla charged
that "sickening apathy“ has al-
most become a tradition on the
part of the students. ‘

"It is a shame." he lamented.

“that students here at the Uni-
versity tend to disdain_ anything
political. Perhaps. in the near fu-
ture they will begin to realize that
they should be instrumental in ob-
taining what they consider to be
needed. instead of letting other
people do all the work."

A group of freshman inven-
tors met last Friday to lay the
groundwork for a proposed
University Student Inventors
Association.

The stated purpose of the
organimtion is to “have fun in-
venting, to discover and de-
velop talent, and to continue
inventing."

The next meeting is 12 noon _
Friday, Jan. 29, 604 Engineer-
ing Hall.

Faculty who have received a
questionnaire de.aling with the
accessibility problems of han-
dicapped students are request-
ed to return the forms by Jan.. ‘
30 to the Department of Spe-
cial Education and Rehabilita-
tion. The project personnel, in--
cluding Robert Newman, Dave
Weir and ‘ Peter Hall, extend
their deepest appreciation to
the more than 500 faculty,
members who have contribut-
ed to the study.

One noticeable area in The Pitt

both emphasis and quality in the

Basic flaws of the evaluationgprocess

for another way to do things."

Preliminary responseto the methods
of the evaluation have generally been

-encouraging. A number of department

chairmen have expressed a willingness
to co-operate with the SGEC in future

One possible solution to the distribu-

tion problem involves. the active partici-

’pation of the faculty in handling the

"(by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

The case for self defense is a
point of women‘s liberation that
is seldom criticized. even by
anti_-faminists. The justification
obviously rests on the need for
individual, survival in social
times that grow
more violent as our environ-

ment becomes congested and‘

threatening.

The push for self-protection

techniques t'or women. however.
entertains a goal beyond the
merely physical. A_ female armed
with the knowledge that she
can take care of herself is “a.

female with confidence in her-

self‘ as an independent human
being. »

Many of us acceptour physi-
cal “inferiority" as inevitable:

welhave become accustomed to ’

using a series of “delaying
techniques“ to get out of tight
situations with male aggressors.

An Incident

Example: several weeks ago.
a female friend reported that.
during a 25 mile bus trip from
her suburban home I to the
campus.’ she was constantly,
harrassed by a male fellow pas-

. senger. Despite a relatively. emp-

ty bus. he insisted ongplopping

   

increasingly to

down next to her and plying her. , ‘unwant‘edadvan,ces?.

    

with personal questions laced
with the sexual undertones we

have all experienced one time,

or another,

Her strategy consisted of first
ignoring him (pretending that
her opressor did not exist). sec-
ondly. informing him that she
had a “boyfriend" (using the
indirect threat of a male protec-
tor)‘ and finally physically mov-
ing away from him (thus throw-
ing the decision to leave upto
him). 0 , - i .

Since she failed to directly
relate her feelingsto him. he
remained in control of the situ-
ation and she was completely
manipulated. Her final solution
was to jump off the bus when it
arrived in Pittsburgh and dis-
appear into the crowd.

It is impossible to condemn
her. How many of us have turn-

ted rings around and pretended

that we were married to avoid
potential molesters? How many
of us have stuffed our hair into
masculine—style hats so that we
would be taken t'or males and

thus left alone‘? How many of;

use have had to run to police-
men. bus drivers and other

-‘fstrong looking“‘men for help

when we are the victims ,of

. evitable."

“Femininity”
In our sexist_society. the help-
lessness g of the female is con-
sidered a social advantage—~

- a sign of softness and “femin-

inity". School physical educa-
tion programs are oriented to
building the male body.,,Athlet-
ic events are male shows at
which the women is an awed
spectator. And yet. both males

and females accept this struc- J
ture as “the way things have’

always been done."

With the budding of female
consciousness. however. many

women are beginning to reject‘
_ the other-directed

images of
themselves and to recognize that
a human being is composed of
mind and body in healthy har-
mony.

A human being. in order to
survive with integrity. must en-

joy some degree of valid self-»

determination. Women‘s-- Liber-
ation. in its ultimate goals.
wants no more — or less — than
that.

Physical self
is an important first step. With-
out doubt. it will produce a
generation of women" unwilling

to take the shit that has been

considered for centuries ‘ﬂin-

Plrmdits to campus philosophers

Editor; The Pitt News:

I have just read your cover
story “Philosophy Excels" The
Pitt News. January 20 and
would like very much to set
the record straight concerning
the ratings awarded the Philo-
sophy Department in the recent-
ly published ACE survey of grad-
uate education. My motive is
simply that plaudits. when in
order. should to to those who

I have earned and deserved them.

The cover story suggests that
I personally had something to do

‘ with the Departments fine show-

ing. As I emphasized to the re-
porter who interviewed me. I
was not evena member of the
Pitt faculty at the time (1969)

when the ACE survey was con-
ducted. ‘
The Department was then

chaired by one of the world’s

foremost logicians, Alan Ross

Anderson. Furthermore, the first
move ‘toward excellence occur-
red in_ 1960 when Adolf Grun-
baum came to Pittsburgh as An-
drew Mellon Professor of Philo-
sophy; at that time Oliver Reis-
er, now Professor Emeritus, was
acting chairman. Soon thereafter
Professors Nicholas Rescher
(1961), Kurt Baier, (1962), Nuel
Belnap (1963), Storrs McCall
(1963), Jerome Schneewind

(1963) and Wilfrid Sellars (1963)

came into the Department, cre-
ating the “critical mass” men-
tioned in the cover story.

This illustrious group was soon
enlarged by other
philosophers: Richard Gale (1964)
Alan Anderson (1965). and Wil-
liam Bartley III (1967). And by

‘academic year 1968-69 the facul-

ty included such able - junior
members as Myles’ Brand, Joseph
Marilyn
Frye. Robert Schultz and George
Wilson.

Other then junior faculty who

have moved to other departments
Russell

are Francis Coleman.
Dancyi. Michael Rohr. and Mar-
tin Tweedale. These were the
people who earned the high
ratings awarded ‘to the depart-
ment. and their name should
not go unmentioned.

who. at last count. had publish-
ed 31 books dealing with almost
every topic in philosophy- the
Departments teaching commit-
ment is exemplified in Prof.
Schneewind. who in addition to
his many duties as Dean of
CAS. continues to teach on a
regular basis: and the versatility

g of the Department is reflected’
in such a person as Prof. Bartley

whose competencies run from
philosophy of religion to scien-
tific methodology.

The cover story correctly
noted that the Department has
received the strong, loyal byt
discriminating and judicious sup-
port of the University Adminis-

It is impossible to mention all

Reflections on

C . I .
LlI)8I‘(ltl0n  
Emun:ThePntNewsL
Just a few reflections on the

recent womens lib coverage in
The Pitt News:

1. Referring to the "Techni-
cutie“ issue. did it occur to any-
one that the girl in the picture

might have wanted to‘ be a sex \

symbol —— no one forced her to
wear that bikini. A

2. In regard to the problem at

Gustines. one of the girls was
quoted as saying. "Your job as
bartender is not to ask us to
leave but to ask us what we

want." It‘s.just another irony I

of women's lib that they don‘t
want their roles as women stere-
otyped. but they don't hesitate
toistereotype other peoples!

Letters To The Editor .

Power

Dear Mr. Donatelli:

Your article. “The Intellectual
Systemization of Minority Group
Mentalities" which appeared in
the Jan. 11 issue of The Pitt News
convinces me that those of us who

‘are involved in the human rights

movement have made little im-
pact on people such as you. As a
white male you cannot possibly
relate to the demands presented
by the BAS.

Also, as a male. you cannot pos-
siblyrelate to the women of this
institution who are engaged in a
struggle to end discrimination on
the basis of sex which does indeed
exist. You make far too many as-
sumptions which-tells me that you
are not even acquainted with the
issues.

Most of us from a white, middle-
class background assume that
those in positions of power are
concerned about us, that we are
are represented by persons in
positions of trust who will make
decisions that reflect our ideas
and beliefs. The tragedy results
when those in power fail to exer-
cise their responsibility for those
they represent.

Laws do exist that should free
us from the role of second-class
citizens. The laws came into ex-

holders unresponsive to minority

istence because of pressures ex-
erted upon our representatives.
these representatives did not
choose to pass the laws upon their
own initiative, this, too. required
pressure.

Do those in power automatical-
ly implement the law? No. it is
the oppressed who demand im-
plementation. Without this mo-
tivating force, nothing would be
done.

The system at the present time
prevents us from being truly rep-
resented bcause there seems to
be no one in a decision-making
position who really understands
the urgency for immediate
change. We, too, are tired of wait-
ing and living on empty promises.

Only a feminist (an individual
active in the human rights move-
ment) can be responsive to our
needs. and can exercise her fem-
inist beliefs to influence others
also in top-level. decision-making
positions, and whose influence
then can be generated toward mo-
tivating others tOr be concerned
for other human beings. This is
why we must have a feminist as a
vice-chancellor.

You state, “lndividual acquired the right to
pursue their own ends uninhibited. The stan-

- dards of living rose faster than anytime in his-

tory. But most important, people from humble

origins rose to important places in society on
the basis, not of birthright, but an ability.

Whoever got the job done best received his
just due. Unfortunately, this is but a dream.
There are those of us who have done our jobs,
and very well, only to find the rewards not
forthcoming. A man in a similar position
would be amply rewarded in his paycheck,
women are not, it's that simple. A man is not
expected to perform clerical functions in ad-
dition to his administrative duties, so he is
provided with a staff to relieve him of these
details.

A woman in a similar position, most often
types many of her own letters (as lam doing),
has a small staff and is required by these re-
strictions to handle the details normally as-
signed to others. Does ability then, really
count, or does this not mean she must be
twice as competent as a man?

You state, "To those who argue that dis-
crimination has put them in their present di-
lemma, f can only reply that the proper reme-
dy is to work for the elimination of any
scheme which causes race or color to be the
determining factor in employment." This, Mr.
Donatelli, is exactly what we are doing.

You state, “Finally, it should always be
remembered that the ultimate and only
source of permanent advancement is self-im-
provement.” How unenlightened you really
are. Our system of education is based on the
life-styles of men. Women's life-styles are
different.

Most men came to college assuming they
will enter a profession, women are reluctant
to confide their aspirations for a career be-
cause they have been so conditioned to the

"mother, child-rearing, houskeeping syn-
drom” that they feel guilty for wanting to
spend their life in the field they wish to en-
ter. Then, the males further discourage wom-
en by reminding them of their “true role” in
society—to marry and rear children.

There is no guarnatee for a woman that
marriage and having children relieves her of
financial responsibility. There are those of us
who as single parents are responsible for the
support of our children and who find it virt-
ually impossible to hold down a full time job,
be a parent, housekeeping and continue
one’s education, all at the same time, with
the result that the overburdening of respon-
sibilities prevents us from acquiring the addi-
tional education we need, or are told we
need.

But, what about taking into consideration
life's experiences, which is actually applying
knowledge without formally being schooled
in theory? If someone were really concerned,
this could be accomplished.

It is hoped that our young women today,
who find themselves in a similar position of
child-rearing responsibilities will have the
advantages of a Child Development Center,
where the children will not receive custodial
care, but encouragement for the development
Center, where the children will not receive
custodial care, but encouragement for the
development of their creative abilities.

Such a Center, too, could be viewed as a
“family learning center,” because the par-
ents of children enrolled would have respon-
sibilities in addition to financial ones for the
on-going programs of the Center. These some
women, then, could in addition to holding

needs

down a job, also have the opportunity of fur-
thering their education.

Or, other women, released from “child
care” could attend the University on a full-
time basis, acquiring the education they,
deem necessary for them to be fully contribut-
ing members of society.

On the other hand, a woman who chooses
to, stay at home to raise a family, has that
family with her for only a short period of time
during the total span of her lifetime. What
does she do when they leave?

She may choose to up-grade her skills, en-
roll in a program designed to acclimate her to
the stresses of today's business world, but
when she returns to that world ready to con-
tribute her skills and know-how, she finds the
frustrating experience of being treated as
though she is inferior, and gradually she rec-
ognizes that she is a second class citizen.

It is all a matter of perspective.
Mr. Donatelli.

No question about Brnrnhnll’s integrity

An Open Letter to Professor Bramhall:

Although I did not favor the Prologue Program
in the form in which it was presented to us as the
FAS meeting I should like to dissociate myself from
those speakers that implicitly and explicity ques-
tioned the intellectual integrity of you and the other

framers of the proposal.

I‘m happy to note that most the debate seemed
relevant. Other parts of it. however. caused me to
leave the meeting feeling very depressed. in spite
of my side having "won." I was distressed at the at-
titude that the proposal was somehow being thrust

at us by a partisan committee.

After all. everyone was aware that the proposal
came to us only after extensive debate by the FASC
and. particularly. the CASC. Both of these (fmlncils

\N<::mer Bros.

elected by us. approved the proposal in the form in
which we received it.

Everyone was also aware of the history of your

Royal Shakespeare Theatre Visited

 

by CINDY MORGAN

Assistant Entertainment Editor

Approximately forty sleepy
people boarded a chargered bus
in front of the University Travel
Service on Saturday morning at
4:30 a.m. to spend a day in New
York City. a day whose primary
focus was to view Englands Roy-
al Shakespeare Company in A
Midsummer Night’s Dream direc-
ted b_y Peter Brook.

Those participating in the trip
were extracted primarily from
Speech 21 (an introdu_ction ‘ to
theatre course) and members of
Pitt‘s Speech and Theater De-
partment.

The Billy Rose Theatre

The Billy Rose Theatre. the
temporary home of the company.
was packed with New Yorkers
and tourists that afternoon. each
trying to get in to see the 2
o‘clock matinee. Many unfor-
tunately had to be turned away.

We found the Billy Rose The-
atre decorated in reds and golds,
with an exquisite ceiling paint-
ing comprised of white roses and
crawling blue mo/rning glories.

The stage setting was devoid
of props. with a glaring white
set facing the audience. one
which later proved to be a per-
_fect vehicle to be decorated
with colorful costumes. intrig-
uing action. and a totally beauti-
ful fantasy. -

I must admit I was primed
for the performance. and my ex-
citement was whetted to an
even greater degree when I
spied the catwalk above the main
floor of the set. a “long—haired“
musician perched at the corner
of that walk‘ with drums and
other percussion instruments.
ladders built indiscreetly into
-the set walls. and _a huge bright
pink feather suspended in the
center of the stage.

Soon. with.a great rush. the
performers crashed through two
swinging doors in the back of
the set and swarmed majestic-
ally on stage. The fantasy be-
gan to take shape. ‘

Successful Production

It is hard to say which aspect
of the company's talents contri-
buted most to the beauty and
tremendous success of the pro-
duction. Acting. music. sets.
costumes. all were handled flaw-

‘ lessly and professionally.

Was it the acting‘? Perhaps. for
it was humorously and seriously
delivered. with conviction. Not
one line was lost because some-
one was not loud enough. or
because of slipshod diction. The
company certainly stood up to
my high expectations and the
reputation which preceded them
as being the greatest company
of Shakespearean actors in the
world.

 Was it the setting? Creativity
was evident hereas huge steel
coils dangled from the catwalks
representing the forest. Lighten-
ing was represented by weight-
ed strips of colorful blue and sil-
ver aluminum strips tossed over-
head. Some of the oldest tricks
in the trade were used such as
the shaking of aluminum sheets
to produce thunder, yet somehow
it all was accepted with great
‘credibility. . . for a moment I
think we all were caught up in
its dream world. I

Was it the percussion session?
Drums. bells. and harplike sounds
all added to the creation of a
dream. It was put together so
that even the sounds of the fairy
land were not omitted. _.

Was it the acrobatics? (Yes.
acrobatics.) One thing I never
expected was the tremendous
ability of the cast to handle them-
selves on stage in the manner in
which they did.

Outstanding Abilities

Their abilities are the most
‘amazing I have ever seen. They
slid up and down ladders, swung
from ropes and swings, and act-
ed as gymnasts might. For ex-
ample, one girl clutched the

swing in her .hands as she dang-
led above the stage and flailed
angrily around as ‘she recited

her role. It was surprising how

.1/. and ,4  /I/lidsum/rrcr /\7ig/zt’5 Zmvzm Kama’ ‘Cruc

the cast could carry out their
acting function while perform-
ing some very exhausting feats
without showing strain.

In another scene. Oberon. the
king of the fairies. and his assis-
tant Puck were sitting on two
swings high above the stage
floor. speaking their lines. Do
you remember those whirley-
bird toys you had when you yvere
a kid? Well. they had silver
ones. and asone character spun
his on a gleaming rod. he was
lowered and passed it to the
other on his stick.

These "toys" were used fre-
quently throughout the perfor-
mance to represent the speed.
power. and fantasy of the fairy-
land kingdom. And they gave a
prime example of how the com-
pany didn't overlook a thing in
the production. I ‘

At one point, the silver disc
was dropped downward to Ober-
on from -Puckat the top of the
catwalk. Even though Oberon
missed, it was handled so that
the illusion was retained. A
fairy’s gray costumed arm ap-
peared with another spinning
disc which Oberon deftly lift-
ed onto his stick.

Costuming was varied. and in
many cases. rich and glamour-
ous. The four lovers of Shakes-
peare's play were dressed in
white costumes with tie-died
colorings. The fairies were
completely costumed in gray.
And Puck was in bright yellow
satin to separate him from the
other fairies.

Oberon and his queen were
beautiful figures. He in his
purple and she in her green
satin. and both with ‘white capes
lined in sparkling gold.

In the final scene of the
show the duke and duchess ap-
peared for the wedding scene
adorned in rich wine and deep-
er purple floor-length robes.

Humor Played Its Part

Humor. too. was another key
to the plays success. One par-
ticularly humorous sub-plot was

the story of Bottom and his

group thought themselves great
actors. Bottom himself thought
he could play any part ever
written. And their prime goal
was to perform for the Duke
and Duchess‘ wedding.

Besides the laughs provided by
their acting disabilities the
humor provided when Oberon
turned Bottom into an ass, com-
plete with hooves was another
humorous angle. Of course
Shakespeare meant it to be funny,
but the bumbling conceited ass
could have been a hard role to
portray but was expertly handl-

Lord: ‘Master of  

by MICHAEL SIMON

The free Organ Recitals. pre-
sented by University Organist
Robert  Lord give students a
chance to see a genuine master
of the pipe organ.

The Monday night recital.
featuring a mixture of past and
contemporary masters. was
well performed. on the massive
3.954 pipe instrument in lleinz
Chapel.

First performed was the Prel-
ude and Fugue in E flat Major.

" otherwise known as the St. Anne

Fugue by J.S. Bach. Although
the work had very heavy reli-
gious overtones. it by no means

restricted its audience to viewing

only the Holy Trinity. Fantasia
of all kinds could be interjected
into the sometimes pastoral.

‘sometimes thunderous composi-

tion.
My favorite was the second

“ selection, entitled Trios Medita-

tions sur la Saint ‘Trinite, by
Langlais. It is interesting to note
that this particular artist is still
living, and has been steadily

composing and performing re-

gardless of the fact that he has
been blind since birth.

Again. this piece was origin-
ally designed as religious music.

although my interpretation con-
jured up a far different view-
point. The haunting. mad atmos-
phere created by Lord made me
envision the legendary Phan-
tom of the Opera in a most
glorious moment of insanity in
the Heinz Chapel.

The third piece. Dominica
Resurrectionis by Tournemire
was a let down. Although this
particular artist was considered
to be the most brilliant improvis-
or during his lifetime in Paris.
the Gregorian Mass which he
presented bordered on tedium.
Lord adaptly played it. except
that the music definitely lacked.
in my estimation. any real value
other than that of an exception-
ally long. dull religious service.

Through twenty repetitions
of the same utterance with vis-
ual images superimposed upon
that utterance. Frampton. in
his words, attempted to gener-
ate a chasim or abyss in his
1969 film. Artificial Light. Al-
though the film created a feel-
ing of frustration (which at times
seemed to be his purpose) ‘there
was a strong sense of continuity.
of right now. and a sense of
sensitivity for words.

“Zorns Lemma,” a film that
Frampton began on 1962 and
finished last year, was the long-
est and is considered Frampton’s
ultimate. The film revolves
around the title word “Lemma,”
which means that every partially
ordered large set has a fully
ordered smaller set.

As expected. it wasn't pos-
ible to completely comprehend
the significance of Framptons
‘films: but then again. his art
is really for him. not for us.

/

The final selection, the Prel-
ude and Fugue in G minor, by
Marcel Dupre, who is still alive,
was played in a most enjoyable,
lyrical style by the organist. It
was a fine example of the care-
ful, rationally planned organ
piece which ends in a clashing
finale.

All in all. the music is very
potable. of an excellent quality.
and you needn‘t be a master
of classical music to appreciate
its inherent beauty.

Lord introduces each particu-
lar work. and in an affable man-
ner gives a short history to his
audience. In short. an evening
of great entertainment. which
is free to anyone.

The next organ recital is
scheduled for Tuesday. Febru-
ary 2. at 12 noon in the Heinz

What looks like one of the

The newly-formed group is
Dave Mason and Cass Elliot.
two very good performers who
are. I think. even better togeth-
er.

Mason, formerly with Traffic,
and Cass, formerly with The
Mamas and The Papas, put on
an excellent show and proved
their ability to make good mu-
sic together.

The music is rock—not hard.
not soft—with an emphasis on
vocals. The group is strengh-

The group concentrated main-
ly on songs from Masons solo
album. "Alone Together.“ In
addition. however. they did
several tunes from their upcom-
ing album. “Mason and Cass.
CPA‘s.“ which will bereleased
in February. These songs were
very "together" and were well-
suited to the group.

Vocal harmony was very strong
between Cass and Mason, as may
be expected. Mason's composi-
tions and guitar work lent a sort
of mystical quality to the group,
while Cass added a vocal line
which showed versatility and
strength not found in Mason’s
solo album.

And the backup band was

tunately. this style has come to
be the trademark of the 70‘s
and no end is in sight. I did not
see one example of any new vari-
ation from the already redund-
ant. but no doubt pleasing motif.

Outgrowths of the style were
evident in the Peter Maxian
psychedelic that has become a
very profitable form of poster
art, to a very bizarre 1950's type
lithograph entitled Fractions,
by Yanouare, that was a throw-
back to the artistic groping char-
acteristic of that era.

Prints of Picasso provided a
refreshing break. from the col-
lection. as there were no ap-
preciable effort by anyone to
copy his particular form. Even
Salvador Dali was represented
by a somewhat mindbending
poster.

The fact remains that there
is an abundance of good prints
and posters done by some of
the best painters in the world.
and if nothing else the collec-
tion remains a good place. as
Post—Gazette Art Critic Donald
Miller stated. “to pick up excel-
lent reproductions of fine art for
a very reasonable cost.“

Barring the redundancy, the
exhibit gives quite a pictorial
history of the new art, and is a
good place to see where art is
at during the present. The price
can’t be heat, from ten to fifty
dollars for any piece shown.

The exhibit will run to Feb. 6
and there is no admission charge.

Mason and Cass: Better Together

gan. piano. and electric piano.
These three will be a perman-
ent part of the group.

The ability of the musicians
was shown in one part of the
performance when the audience
began screaming to hear “Feel-
in’ Alright“. a song written and
originally recorded when Mason
was with Traffic. Cass told the
audience that. they simply
couldn't do it because they had
never rehearsed it.’ The f.\’ew
Yorkers didn"t buy that excuse.
though.

Finally, Mason stepped to the
microphone and said, “All right,
I’ll do it.” He and the band
launched into the song without
hesitation, and unless they had
been told, the audience would
never have know that most of
the players were improvising
their parts.

And as the five threaded their
way through songs like "World
And Changes." "Dear Mr. Fan-
tasy." and "Waitin‘ On You."
this reviewer found it very diffi-
cult to sit still. because the mu-
sic was exciting and alive.

About the only flaw in the
performance was in the spoken
rapport between the group and
the audience. Cass has a ten-
dency to be rather long-winded
on stage. and she tried to waste
time by rapping to the audience.

After a while, the extremely
critical spectators hardly let her
open her mouth. They kept
shouting, ‘.‘Sing!” which in a way
was a compliment.

In this age when many rock
musicians are splitting with
their groups. going out on
their own. and playing a song
or two on other peoples al-
bums. it looks like Dave Mason

and Cass Elliot have combined

Pressure From Bench :22

by MARTY HELLMAN

Last season. Kent Scott could afford his luxury
of missing his first couple of shots in a game before
he -started to hit. With the addition of Buzzy Harri-

to this seasons Panther basketball squad. the

WIIawk" has been under added pressure to produce.

As opposed to a steady performance last year
gig/gjlgéh he led the team in scoring as a sophomore
with 16.9 points per game. he has been erratic in
recent games. vascillating from not scoring at Cor-
nell to last Saturday's great showing against North
.;_C§tr0line State where he scored 30 points although
h”’é'"°§'at out about ten minutes.

“There's a little more pressure on me now." he

 said. "but it's better for the team that the bench is

stronger. If i start off a
little cold. I might not
get a chance to recover
now. whereas last year
’ I'd keep playing even
though I wasn't hit-
ting."

After going 13-for-19
against the Wolfpack,
Scott raised his present
scoring clip to 14.5, tops
on the squad. His field
goal percentage is cur-
rently 48 per cent, only
three percentage points
off his Pitt sophomore
record.

KENT SCOTT

“I've been off-and—on
this year but it's coming along. and I think it's get
better."

Scott picked the perfecttime to have his best
game of the season Saturday. With the Panthers
down by one point with five minutes remaining.
Scott hit two long jumpers to regain the lead that
the squad maintained to the final buzzer.

' Leading Scorer Scott
Having Erratic Year

  
  

 Along with Harrison, Scott and senior Bill Downes
havehandled the bulk of the playmaking from the
guard position for the Panthers. Scott feels that the
different styles of the three are of a great advan-
tage to the squad.

“We all complement each other and I don't think
that we lose anything when one of us goes out."
Scott says. “It seems one guy picks up the slack.“

Scott. not noted as much for his defensive play
as his shooting. feels that it is improving since last
year.

“Knowing Coach (Fran) Webster's defensesrj took
a while. but I think I've been reacting better lately."

Kent cites last year's play as one of the prime
reasons for the team's overall improvement now.

“We had four sophomores playing then. and we
gained a lot of experience. Everybody has become
more confident."

Tonight’s game against Temple is the first time
that Scott will be playing in the Palestra in Phil-
adelphia.

“In a way I'm glad the game is there." he said.
"but I guess it'll be tough."

Kent refuses to look ahead to the end of the sea-
son. but realizes that tonight's game is “the biggest
one left."

Scott is pleased with the pattern type of offense
that Coach Buzz Ridl employs for the Panthers.
“The offense gives all of us a chance to get off a lot
of shots and the patterns are easy to understand.”

Because Scott's main asset to the team is his
high scoring potential. he recognizes the fact that
one or two bad games will not put him permanently
on the bench for the opening tipoffs.

"I think the coach has made it known to me that
I'm going to start even if I have a bad game in the
previous one." _he said.

 Ki1lin’s Final Season

Plagued By Injuries

by MIKE MILLER

Saturday's victory over Michi- A

gan was a triumph for the Pitt
wrestling team. but for Bob Kuhn
it was another small tragedy.

Kuhn lost a 9-4 decision due to a
pesky gremlin that has plagued
the grap squad this season. an in-
jury.

He started off witha shoulder
separation and then tore cartilage
in his rib cage.’The later injury
hampers his wrestling technique.
which involves a great deal of roll-
ing with opponents.

As a result of these set-backs
this wrestling season hasn’t been
all that it could be for the senior
grappler.

"I was disappointed in my first
match." says Kuhn. "because I
didn't get a pin. I wanted to go all
season pinning everyone."

Despite this disappointment
and the shoulder injury. Kuhn re-
mained undefeated. Last Monday
he tore the rib cartilage in prac-
tice. but insisted on wrestling at
Indiana. Tuesday. to keep his mo-
mentum.

“I never had an undefeated sea-
son, and I was hoping for one. I'm
disappointed that it's my last
year, and I can’t go all season un-
defeated.”

Kuhn's injury is adifficult one
to wrestle with. There is nothing
that can be done to minimize the
pain. A shoulder can be taped to
restrict its movement and hold

down the pain but the back injury .

just has to be endured.

“A lot of people don't realize
how bad he's hurt." remarked
Pitt Coach Dave Adams after the

BOB KUHN
Who needs a vacation?

Michigan match. "Most guys
wouldn't wrestle in his condition."

Kuhn won’t quit, though.

"I realized that this is my sen-
ior year and it dawned on me that
it's my last year. so I'll endure a
little bit of pain and go through
with it." the grapplers‘ captain
said.

Now he looks forward to the
tournaments. Last year he was
sixth in the nation.

“It’s the team's record that
counts now. I don’t care about my
individual record.”

The doctor says a three week
convalescence would help.

"I told the doctor. ‘You take a
three week vacation I'm not going
to.'" Kuhn said.

troubles. LaSalle beat them 63-

beat St. Joe’s in one of the

its second loss of an almost flaw-
less season before a very partisan
New York crowd. And the loss
to South Carolina came only

‘after the Owls gave .up a second

half lead.

The Palestra itself presents
the Panthers with a problem. Al-
though the Owls, according to

 

4*

Shrier, has had eratic support .

from the student body this year-,
a large pro-Temple crowd is ex-
pected with the second game of
the double-header featuring a
contest between Villanova and
LaSalle.

As a result of last Saturday's
NC State, game. Kent Scott
now leads the Panthers in scor-
ing with a per game average of
14.5 points. Folling Scott in
the Pitt scoring Column are Paul
O'Gorek. averaging 11.7. Mike
Paul (11.1) and Buzzy Harrison
(10.5). O'Gorek leads the team
in rebounding. grabbing close
to 10 per ballgame with Carl
Morris following with~an aver-

age of seven per game.

Both Litwack and Shrier have
been respectful of the Panther
success this season. "I was talk-
ing to one of the assistants. said
Shrier. “and they hold Pitt in
very high regard."

.»\ll-American Honors

In Track  

Nationals

by VINCE DI NARDO

Dorel Watley. who runs track for Coach Jim Banners Pitt team
and who is thought of highly by his coach. has "superﬁcial" dreams.
He dreams of becoming an All-American in March. and of someday go-
ing to the Olympics. If Watley doesn't watch out. he may find his

dreams coming true.

"I want to become an All-American at the Nationals in March." he
said. "Last year I was inexperienced. This year I know I m going to be-

come one."

Watley also expressed higher
hopes in the future.

“Right now I want to become an
All-American. Some time in the

i ' future I'd also like to go to the

Olympics.”

Watley, a New Yorker (from
Queens). originally came to Pitt
on a full scholarship from the 3—M
program. a minority group fund.

"Pitt has good track facilities."
Watley said. "_I also found a better
team than I expected.“

The Newton High School grad
also has some complimentary
words for his coach, Jim Banner.

“He (Banner) gives guys a
chance to prove themselves,“
said Watley, who is Black. “With
all the racial tension that exists.
the coach is fair to all. I consider
him color-blind. He judges an ath-
lete by his talents and not his col-
or. Other athletes have told me
their coaches aren't so fair.“

Summing it up briefly Watley
said. “I like him a lot."

Keystone In
56-37 Witt

With each team sporting a 2-0
record. Keystone and the House
of Lords met head-on Monday
night at Trees Hall gym.

The House of Lords jumped out
to an early 14-6 lead but Keystone
quickly came back to handily win.
56-37. While behind early. Key-
stone displayed a hot hand. scor-
ing 12 points compared to the
Lords 2.

In the first half it was Chuck
Bussick of the Lords showing
some deceptive moves and scor-
ing 10 points. However. in the sec-
ond half. Bussick and the rest of
the Lords were virtually shut off
by Keystones defense. The half-
time score was 22-15 in favor of
the Lords.

The second half was dominated
by Keystone. Due to the relent-
less hot hands of Joe Brown,
Chuck Heward and John Myrick,
the Lords couldn’t pose a threat to
Keystone. Heward, who had only
two points at the half, poured in
13 more in the second half to lead
all scorers. Joe Brown, Keystones
captain, scored eight straight
points to thwart the Lords futile
drive.

Late in the second half. John
Myrick got into foul trouble and
had to be replaced. Aside from
this. there was no threat posed to
either team in the foul category.

Besides his own individualistic
hopes, Watley also has dreams
which according to him are very
close to reality for the rest of the
track squad.

"I'd like to see us win the
IC4A‘s. That would make us the
best team in the East." he com-
mented. “Last year we didn't
have enough depth. This is the
best team I've been on and we
have a lot of depth."

He continued by analyzing Pitt's
National aspirations. "

“I think we could even do some-
thing nationally,” he said. “Not
many people expect very much
from Pitt. I would be considered
an upset but, I think we can do it.
In fact, I think we could get into
the top five.”

Since coming to Pitt. Watley
has already attained some of his
goals.

"When I was in high school. I
did the_440 in 49.0. I made up my
mind that I was going to do below
that here." His lowest time so far
in the 440 has been 47.0.

Watley is glad he came to Pitt
and believes his coach has helped
him in his development.

"It‘s a sort of a give-and-take
thing." he explained. "the coach
shows you your mistakes. and you
go out and do what he tells you.“

"Don’t believe a word Dorel
tells you." joked assistant coach
Dennis Johnson about Watley‘s in-
tention to become an All-Ameri-

' can.

“Oh year!" answered Watley.
"you just wait and see!"

Panther Diver

 

by JAN FRY

Pitt's top diver and swim team captain. Dave
Wessel. has been nominated as one of the outstand-
ing college athletes of the year. but he doesn't know
how it happened.

"I don't know who nominated me. but whoever
it was I thank you.“ remarked the first-year dental
student. "I am at a loos as to what is happening."

Wessel‘s surprise is unusual for someone with a
record like his.

In 1959, at the age of ten, Wessel started doing
a few dives because, “he was too small to do any-
thing else.”

These few dives and the encouragement of his
parents spurred him on. While attending Churchill
High. he swam backstroke. anything in relay. and
sometimes fly. However. in diving he placed second
in the WPIAL two years and third in the state.

Why did he come to Pitt?

“I was informed that Coach Rick Gilbert, Nation-
als champion in diving from Cornell, was coming to
Pitt, so I signed,” Wessel explained. “It’s true that
the dental school helped sway me toward coming
here, but the coaching was a large factor.”

Concerning the fact that Gilbert never arrived.
Wessel said. “Mr Grant said someone else would
coach. and I‘m not qualified to say what happened."

The holder of a Panther Foundation scholarship
continued. “Pitt's been good to me. If I hadto it all
over again I'd do the same."

While at Pitt, Wessel has broken the Trees Pool
one and three-meter diving records with scores of
290.20 and 317.85, respectivdly, and the Pitt rec-
ord in one and three-meter scoring, with 293.85 and
317.85. The last two years he placed fourth (1969)
and fifth (1970) in the Easterns.

"I feel that] did better last year. even though I
didn't place as high." Wessel stated. “Scores va-
ried about 60 points between divers last year.
where they varied about 150 the year before. Last
year the competition was tougher."

Wessel Strives

Dave Wessel, an “outstanding athlete" nominee.

By his one-meter diving in the West Virginia
meet last Wednesday. Wessel has qualified for the
nationals this year. Last year he placed 40th in the
NCAA championships.

“The Easterns have been good to me. so this ~

year I‘m going to the Nationals with revenge." he
said.

The two things Wessel strives for in diving is an
increase in confidence and consistency.

"Confidence is something I never really had.
Wessel said. "I have to convince myself that I can
work the dives upstairs. I aim to dive consistently
and would like to peak at the end of the season."

Wessel cites diving Coach William Brown as one
of his reasons for success. "People don‘t know much
about him. but he's the greatest. Being around him
has been such a good influence on me. He's helped
me so much in diving.

Are the Olympics on the agenda in the next few
years?

Wessel commented. “I have four years of school
ahead of me. so I‘m letting things fall where they
will. There are too many good divers for me to try
the Olympics. but I might just try to see what hap-
pens.
