BY THE PITT NEWS STAFF

At least two deaths and 49
injuries were reported this morning
as a result of an explosion that
ripped through two lecture halls in
Langley Hall yesterday, collapsing
the walls and ceiling into a twisted
mass of concrete and steel rubble.

Pronounced dead by the Alleg-A

heny County Coroner’s Ofﬁce were:
Patricia Hostetler, 20, a Pitt student
from Donegal, Westmoreland
County; and Carleen Curry, 35, a
Project Right-Start secretary from
Shadyside. At least 40 students
suffered abrasions, shock A or
‘lacerations, and nine ﬁremen were
treated at area hospitals.

The Coroner’s report indicated '

Histetler died ‘of blast injuries

affecting the heart and lungs, and
Curry died of thermal burns and
blast injuries affecting the head,
chest and abdomen.)

Unofficial reports last night
indicated a third person might be
dead. I

Area ﬁre officials and University
spokesmen reported the cause of
the explosion was still unexplained,
although ofﬁcials reported the
explosion originated beneath room
221, Langley, in the electron
microscope facilities.

Apparently, no ﬁre accompanied
the blast, which trapped some
victims under the ruins. Police and
ﬁre ofﬁcials used heavy cranes,
power saws and acetylene torches to
sift through the wreckage.

No class was in session in room
221, although four or five people

lifted into an ambulance by rescue workers as dazed by-stander-s

were reported by an eyewitness to
be in the room. The adjacent room,
223, was ﬁlled with between 100
and 160 students attending an
animal physiology lecture.

An eyewitness in 223 said, “I
heard a rumble and a noise that
sounded like chairs and‘ tables
mlling, and when I turned around I
saw the back wall of the room caving
in...then everyone began to run.”

“We were taking a test in a room
across the hall,” another student
said, “when the walls started
shaking. Then there was a loud
explosion and broken glass sudden-
ly came spraying under the doors.”

Rescue crews and 12 fire

companies responded to the alarm
soon after the explosion, which
occurred at approximately 12:40
p.m. Excavation of the debris
continued late into the night, aided
by emergency lighting set up at the
scene. I

Several iirernen were rushed to
area hospitals as a result of the
inhalation of nitrobenzene gas and
methane. V

Norman Sanner, head of the City
Fire Prevention Bureau, who was
later treated and released from
Presbyterian-University Hospital,
said nitrobenzene and methane gas
are highly toxic and can be absorbed
through the skin.

“I don’t know if the two gases
were present before or after the
explosion,” Sanner said.

According to Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) Dean Jerome
Rosenberg, there was an electron
microscopy suite and a behavioral

Chemicals

BY MREA ‘CSORBA

The two Life Science labs
underneath the demolished Lang-
ley lecture rooms contained no
explosive chemicals which could
have caused yesterday‘s tragedy.
Associate Professor of Life Scien-
ces Fredrick Gottlieb said yester-
day.

“The area under the Langley
lecture halls was a Life Science
Suitewhich contained two research
laboratories used by this depart-
ment. The lab directly under
Langley 221 contained electron
microscopes, the room under 223
housed the machinery that sliced
the plastic sections used in the
study of microscopic cells,” Gott-
lieb said.

"Virtually no chemicals were
stored there.” Gottlieb said, “and
none that were explosive. The suite
was a well-~rz1aintaine:d zirea, kept
Clean. repainted and washed down
to keep the microscopes and the

cutting machinery in proper or-
der." "
Gottlieb said that damage

estimates have not been made on
the expensive microscopes, how-
cventhe department's first concern
was the students. ’

“The police sealed off the area
until they determined no students
were trapped in the lab." Gottlieb
said. “Originally, we were worried
a graduate student, who sometimes
works down there, was trapped in
the rubble. We know now no one
was there at the time of the
explosion.”

Gottlieb said a policeman found a
tag which the department identi-

 

Wilsoin photo

ﬁed as an electron microscope
label. This, he said, suggested the
explosion had demolished the
microscopes. But Gottlieb said last
night, “We’ll worry about the
equipment tomorrow." -

At the time of the explosion,
Gottlieb was preparing for his 1
p.m. class in another part, of
Langley Hall. He said it was lucky
the explosion happened around
noon and on a Thursday rather than’
a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday
when class sizes in those rooms are
much larger’.

Associate Professor Harry Wer-
ner from the Department of Earth
and Planetary.Sciences (EPS) said
his 10-10411 a.m. EPS 80 class had
ﬁlled room 221 to capacity. “It was
a terrible thing, but we’re lucky it
didn't happen two hours earlier
when the room was full with my 200
students,” Werner said.

Department of General Services
will be at Pitt today to inspect the
building.

Last night. the Student Health
Service began an emergency
program to cope with the casual-
ties. both physical and emotional,
of the explosion. Health Educator
Jerry Hyner said the center
(located at 205 Brackenridge Hall)
would remain open all night with
the regular staff of nurses,
physicians and psychiatrists to help
any student involved in the
accident. He said that although the
physicians would only be available
until 11:00 p.m.. they would be
‘on call all night.

The student rescue squad, Peer
Medical Aid, also was on stand—by
last night to help any student who
felt the effects of a possible injury.

All phone calls concerning the
conditionor whereabouts of injured
students not being treated at the

Health Center were referred to the
Student Affairs Office. which is-
compiling a list gleaned from the
city's hospitals.

Long-range plans to cope with
the disaster include increased
availability of staff psychologists to
help contend with" any emotional
difficulties associated with the
explosion, and the health staff will
be alert to any futurecomplaints or
symptoms related to gas or smoke
inhalation, according to Hyner.

reported obscene phone calls were
received there yesterday morning,

ln the Midst of Tragedy 

Times of tragedy often are the ﬁnest hours for many members of
mankind. Such as those people who volunteered to give blood after
approximately 50 person’s were injured when Langley Hall’s
auditoriums were ﬂattened by an explosion yesterday.

The Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh often is critically short of blood.
Though no appeal was made, the line in the Blood Bank was so long
yesterday that many had to be turned away and asked to return today.

- That was a rare event in Blood Bank history—-it may never happen
again. Those who gave, or volunteered to give, came from all walks of ’
life. Sure, there were plenty of Pitt students there, fearing for friends
who might have been injured. But there also were strangers who heard

of the incident through the media and wanted to do their part.

They are all to be commended, for it is compassion like this that makes
this planet a bit more human.

A Case of Meddling

It has long been suspected that members of Pitt’s administration do
notthinkvery seriously about student government here. They think it's
something students use to boost ego , to play senator and to pretend

T they're someone important.

The administration does not see student govermnent as it is or should

«be—a representative of the students before the administration. For if

administrators did, they’d advise and not meddle.
There is a point when advice ceases to be advice and becomes
meddling. And the Office of Student Activities certainly went beyond

4 that point when it postponed today’s student government election one

week.

One thing human beings consistently do is make mistakes. And when
they get together in a committee, the group often behaves worse than
the sum of its parts. '

- But in thereal world, when a human being makes a mistake, and
exhausts all the means to undo the mistake, then he must live with it.

The Student Government Judicial Board made a mistake when it
refused to overturn the Student Govermnent Election Committee"s‘
ruling and allow Michael Bates and Sally Shoup a place on the ballot.
But the SGJB, according to the student government constitution, is the
ﬁnal committeeofappeal anditsrulingwasﬁnal.

Since that  is ﬁnal, the postponement of Student Government
elections by the Oﬁce of Student Activities can be considered outright

F interference with  interests. If the  Activities Ofﬁce
considered Student  agovermrient instead of amock-.up,..it . .
would not have  the  of.,an‘ex“post facto appeals --

system for Michael Bates. '

But, instead, itdecidedto stop everything andsee what it coulddofor
Bates and his charges of improprieties that prejudiced the SGJC
decision. There is nothing in the Student Government constitution that
gives Student Activities direct say about who appears on the ballot. But
that is a “right” it exercised.

What if someone loses aclose election, appeals, and loses the appeal?
W111 Student Activities keep holding elections until this hypothetical

personwins?

Theironyofthe situationwasthat Bates changedhis charges after
being granted an appeal. Student Activities frownedupon this and he
withdrewhis request. Noappeal will be heard; the election could have
run as scheduled, this week. — _

A Letter

Ballot Decision ’Outrages’YSA

Two candidates for Student discussion. Furthermore,

Government Board, Michael Bates

the

and Sally Shoup, have been
excluded from the ballot. Both
candidates turned in more than the
required number of petition signa-
tures before the petition deadline.
Both candidates met the required
2.0 grade average. Yet, simply
because the candidates handed in
transcripts forty minutes after the
petition deadline, both have been
ruled off the ballot by decree of the
Student Government Elections
Committee and the Judicial Board.
The decision to exclude Bates and
Shoup is an outrage. In the first
place, this rigid, bureaucratic
application of an arbitrary rule hurts
these two candidates’ chances of
being elected. But the implications
are much broader than that. The
decision limits the candidates’
ability to raise and discuss publicly

. the important issues in this Student

Government election. That hurts
not only the candidates, but the

Dangerous Precedent

State Supported Murder

BY JIM FAREBI

It was ﬁtting that the country
was seized by a’ cold, spell on the
day that Gary Gilmore was
executed. The weather stole the
headlines from the first state-com-

,,mitted murder in ten years,»but bad

weather wll go away.——an injustice
never will.

At ﬁrst Gilmore’s case appears
to be_ quite out of the ordinary.
Instead of trying to escape or delay
his stay on death row he actively
sought the fulﬁllment of his
sentence, delays prompted him to »
attempt suicidevia drug overdose
twice. The murders Gilmore
committed were especially ruth-
le_ss: his victims were both shot to
death while he robbed them, even
though they cooperated completely
and handed ‘over the money
without protest. More common on
death row is Gilmore’s past: a
variety of criines alternating with
long stays in prisons and institu-
tions.

Those who want Gilmore dead
had plenty of ammunition to shoot
with and were wise enough to see
that this was the big chance to
bring back capital punishment.
Gilmore himself supplied the
biggest bullet by being the first
hardened criminal to shout along
with the mob for his own head.

This business about Gilmore
being hailed as a “folk hero" was
advanced as another reason for
killing him. But the attention which
he received was worthy of the

ment Board to the real interests of
students.

The Young Socialist campaign is
taking our case to the university
commnunity and out of the hands of
small, bureaucratically appointed
boards. We believe that most
students support Sally's and
Michael’s right to be on the ballot,
and we urge students to vote for or
write in those candidates who
represent support for democratic
rights.

Pitt Young Socialist Alliance

story’s pertinence, not an indica-

tion of a grotesque idolizationon’

the part of the country. However
this, along with Gilmore’s unre-
deeming past, the brutality of his
crime, and his death wish were
impressed upon the nation's
conscience as sufficiently justify-
ing. if not necessitating, his
destruction. -

But Gilmore’s case was no more
fit to be precedent-setting than
any of the hundreds of others on
death row. In truth, it is ironically
all too common.

Gilmore, like nearly all awaiting .

execution. comes from an economi-
cally and culturally poor back-
ground. I only hesitate to use words
like “product" and “victim"
because of -the bleeding heart
liberal. accusations they evoke.
even though modern psychology
and sociology have rendered such
charges unenlightened». And even
though it is a lie to say that only the
poor kill each‘ other in America, it
would be true to say that only the
poor wind-up on death row for their
killing. .

As Gilmore’s life of crime was a
natural reaction to the quality of his
childhood aswell as, the whole of
his thirty-six years, so his death
wish was overt evidence of mental
instability born of the same
circumstances. An insane man’s
wish to mutilate himself should be
respected no more than his crazed
desire to harm others. Yet this is

‘similarity never ends there.
murder——-in any conlext——neverJ

exactly what transpired in thy,
Gilmore case.

Because the facts are in on how
uneffetive capital punishment is as
a crime deterrent, the latest
pro-death penalty arguments sup-
port murdering the criminal be-
cause he is unreformable and there

is nothing else to be done with him.?'5

But this is an erradication of
symptoms, while leaving the
disease——the negative socialization
of the country's Gary Gilmores-to

continue to rot away on the fringaiji 4!!

of society.

Many would say that the cause
and motivation of being a Gary
Gilmore is irrelevent, since society

must be purged of its hardened s

criminals regar_dless of whose fault
it ‘is that they areas they are. But if
we as a nation adhere to this

reasoning. let us not forget that we”)

killed Gary Gilmore as a matter of
co'nvenience"and practicality-
certainly not morality.‘

Capital punishment is as archaic;-~.; 1

as witch trials. and just as irrational
and purposeless. too. In the

twentieth century we can see the .

sunset on Mars. but we still put
men to death by the same barbaric
means that have existed for years.
In Gary Gilmore’s case, the precise
means that the killer employed
against his victims. But the

abets society.

Who Knows Student Music?

Of late, the S.G. Concert
Programming Committee has been
under extensive ﬁre. Allegations
have been thrown about freely by
people who would seem to know
the facts. We have been forced to
believe their rhetoric, because the
Programming Committee has been
quiet, even as their “advisor."
Jack Brown, jumped aboard the
bandwagon of criticism.

As long as I've been a student
here. the concert committee has
had an air of controversy about it. It
was always for a variety of reasons,

0‘ from citizen (South Oakland)

5 Dave Hesidence.

!&

displeasure over the use of the
Student Union Annex for concerts
to discontent over the choice of
bands for the Greek shows. And
now it seems the student govern-
ment is fed up with the whole
situation and is attempting to
create a “programming board" to
be “more ‘responsive to the
students needs" (or is it tastes?).

These programming experts are
Benita Marcus, Larry Krain, and
Ms. Marcus’
expertise has apparently been
derived in some unusual manner;
she has never been a member of
programming, nor any other major
programming organization on cam-
pus. Mr. Krain is better qualiﬁed;
he was a member of concert
programming for approximately
three months prior to his election to

the board (if we don‘t include being
a concert marshal). during which
time he was -practically invisible.
Mr. Hesidence qualiﬁes because
he is a member of that elite, the
Allocations Committee. Since he
has so much practice deciding how
to correctly spend student money,
he is well prepared to set up a new
programming board.

These bastions of student pro-
gramming rights have in the past
few months helped to destroy any
hope of a homecoming concert
being produced, by their bureau-
cratic incompetence.

Figures of $4,000.00 have been
freely circulated as the debt
incurred for the recent Dave Mason
concert. Where did these ﬁgures
come ‘from; and why do the
programming committee’s books
show a loss of only $158.00? Over
2000 students attended that show
—-—is that a limited appeal? How
many students attend basketball
games? Should they be cancelled?
They are also pointing to a deﬁcit
in programming's account from the
previous ﬁscal year of roughly
$3000.00. '

The Board and Allocations have
done little to ﬁnd out why this debt
occured, even though the current

programming chairmen are well
aware of the rea-
son. Their advisor, from the Office
of Student Activities, ‘committed

the concert committee to expendi-
tures in the months of May and
June, ignoring the University
balance sheets from April showing
only $300.00 in their account. His
commitment totalled over $3,000-
do some quick math and see what
you get. These expenses were NOT
authorized or approved by any
member of the programming
committee. Mr. Brown has admit-
ted to two chairman that he was
aware of the lack of funds prior to
his signing other contracts.

The programming
committee acknowledges the need
for reform, or even restructure. But
why should three Student Govern-
ment Board members whose
programming experience is mini-
mal. to say the least, be the ones to
reform? These people do not have
better programming in . mind-—
rather, they are trying to create a
committee they can control better.
These three people are not trying to
expedite things for a programming
organization-—they wouldn't know
where to begin. The answer is a

6 meeting (or series of meetings) be-

tween representatives of all the
major programming organizations’
on campus. Let them decide on a
working form for coordinating and
allowing all types of programs. and
submit it to the students in a
referendum.

CAE Supports Groups
For A Better Oakland

BY DEBORAH ERLICH AND
BOB GOETZ

The University of Pittsburgh
employs more people in the
Oakland area than any other
business or non-proﬁt organization.
Pitt owns a sizeable portion of the
Oakland community and plans to
expand its holdings. From this
position of strength, the University
could help to initiate new com-
munity business ventures and
expand employment opportunities
for Oakland residents. Instead, the
continued expansion of the Univer-
sity’s land holdings over the last 10
years has forced many small
businessmen to move out of the
area. In some cases, Pitt has fought
against the efforts of community
groups to stimulate the economic
growth of the Oakland area.
Businesses that do relocate are
replaced by bars or “restaurants”
owned by fast food chains like
McDonalds, Burger King, etc.
Many of the patrons of Zelda’s,
Chances R, C.J. Barney’s, etc., are
lured out of their own neighbor-
hoods by Oakland’s reputation for
“swinging nightlife.” This huge
inﬂux of non-residents into an
already over-populated area of the
city creates conditions that lead to
numerous incidents of rape, theft,

vandalism, and fighting that
indicate the immediate need for
effective university-community
action on public safety issues.
Greedy absentee landlords
have a ﬁeld day charging inﬂated
rates to anyone who wishes to live in
close proximity to the University.
Since demand exceeds the supply of
rented housing available, landlords
can and do neglect the plumbing,
heating, and electrical systems of
their buildings. If any repairs are

undertaken, they are usually‘

stop-gap measures which fail to
improve the shoddy quality of the
house or apartment to any great
extent. This lack of concern and
responsibility on the part of
landlords affects not only students
but all residents of Oakland

South Oakland Citizen’s Council
(SOCC), People’s Oakland, - and
Neighborhood Legal Services are
community organizations that deal
with issues like housing and public
safety and how they relate to
community control socc,
People’s Oakland, and Neighbor-
hood Legal Services seeistudents as
an integral part of the Oakland
community and strongly urge them
to bring their problems, questions,
and ideas to their attention.

Meet the CostumeMan

BY MICHELE ROTHERT

Three movers in a pick-up truck

. ride along Penn Avenue, searching

"latest,

for the rear door of Maier’s
Costumes’ warehouse. Minutes
pass before the driversees the
alley. Then" he steers right, brakes
and watches excitedly as the door
opens. t

Inside appears the curly haired,
blue-eyed, grinningface of Larry
Wintersteller, the _39-year-old
costume designer who will accomp-
plish the “largest” if not the

V greatest feat of his life today.

Larry has designed for, sewn for
and “dressed”’many “big” stars
such as Vincent Price, Mickey
Rooney, Bill Bixby and Margaret
Hamilton; but,-even combined, they
never rise to the “height” of his
most challenging client,
Cinemette, Theater's 18-foot, 350-
pound model of King Kong!

“Cinemette paid me $2,000 to
build King Kong,” Larry says with

”a laugh. “I’d charge $5,000 to do it

again!”

The movers grunt. The doorway

,is extremely narrow; and, the.

I

distance between the black, hairy
legs is at least three feet. ’

“Be careful. Everything’s
hand-carved!” Larry shouts.

One-third at atime, the feet, head
and torso are hauled across the
threshold and propped majestically
in the open bed of the truck. Kong’ s
eight-foot arm extends off the back.
A blonde ‘Tiffany Taylor doll
dangles from the great ape palm,
and bulging gorilla eyes rage at
those who dare to look.

“I hurt my back working in a steel
mill and had to do something easy;
but now, I work harder than ever,”
Larry says, donning a Levi's cap.
Short and agile, the costume
designer hops into the truck, sitting
up front while one of the movers

' straddles the ferocious-looking

head in the back. .
Mighty King Kong is. about t
make his comeback at the Gateway
Theater. promoting the new remake
of hisﬁold movie.
“For promotion in shopping
centers, I designed a six-foot loaf of

' Braun’s bread once,” Larry says as

 the truck approaches Penn Avenue.

 

People stomp between parked

cars waiting fortrafﬁc to pass-

their chance to cross the street.
street.

“The Winky’s- commercial on

, local television, where a policeman

talks over a CB, uses a Maier’s
costume. I've been with Maier’s for

four-and-a-half years,” Larry adds.

‘TI do all the costuming for
Misteroger’s Neighborhood. In
1974, I was given nine still

- photographs of ‘Maggie Hamilton’s

or Cora’s ‘Wicked Witch’ (from
“The Wizard of Oz”); and, when
Maggie appeared on the show, she
was dressed in the duplicate
costume I made for her.” _

A group of schoolgirls catches
sight of the large, white teeth, the
head, and the shoulders sticking out
of the truck. They jump on the curb
and scream. I . -

A male voice calls, “Hey, Melvin,
there goes your Mammal-”

“Looks more like you!” Melvin
shouts back.

Larry continues. “I did ‘Oliver’
around Vincent Price; and, I‘ did
‘Sugar’ around Jack Lemmon with
Mickey Rooney. However, Mickey’

.Rooney in the musical version of

‘Some Like It Hot,’ refused to wear

any feminine clothes for his role as

Daphne. He said they were just too

feminine.” ‘ i

As the truck bounces down Penn

Avenue, a woman steps into a deli

and does a double-take. “I swear!”
she comments to the butcher. “I
wou1dn’t.want to meet him in the
dark even if Fay Wray was my
name!”

Larry says,”“I designed costumes"

for rock groups out of all kinds of
material, especially back when
shoulders ‘had the pointed, David

. Bowie look.

“Now, the Pittsburgh Fan
Forum," comic book freaks. wants
me to dress like Hawk Manand ﬂy
across an auditorium on a wire.”
Larry shakes his head.

A PAT bus pulls‘up to the truck.
A smiling drver hits the horn twice.
Then the 71 Negley surges forward,
surprising all the passengers who
gaze out the smudged windows.

‘,‘I dressed Bill Bixby in a set of
tails, which once belonged to John
Barrymore,” Larry says. “‘The
Puzzle Children’ was a nationwide
presentation starring Bixby and
Julie Andrews; Bixby’s portion was
ﬁlmed at WQED. The tails fit him
exactly. They didn’t have to be
altered. Bixby said to me, ‘It
doesn't mean a damn thing that
they belonged to Barrymore!’ I just
think it's funny!”

A sidewalk"‘commedian” yells,
“Hey, look out! A big gorilla’s on
the loose!" He watches with
pleasure as heads swing around.
“Look out where you step! Look out
where you step!”

Larry chuckles at the joke, then

  

This model of King Kong is Wintersteller’s pride
and joy. He made it, mostly out of sticks and wire, for
the Gateway Theatre to promote the new version of

the famous “Kong” movie. The Pittsburgh costume-

“I made
Walkers, a

once more reﬂects.
costumes for the

brother-sister act which imitated’

Sonny and Cher. They went to
Vegas to spend six weeks two years
ago and haven’t returned since!”
He tells thestory proudly.

“When Sonny and Cher were at
the Civic Arena, the Walkers
marched down the middle aisle.
Ushers had to shout ‘That’s not
Sonny and Cher! Go sit down!”

“That's how the Walkers made it A

to Vegas; and, when they went to
L.A., Sonny Bono asked them

where they got their costumes. I 

expected a law suit after that, but I
never got one.”

Five hours and forty minutes
later, Larry Wintersteller is red in
the face. Carefully, he balances his
weight on the top rung of a ladder
while wiring Kong’s arms -to the
ceiling of the Gateway Theater
Lobby.

The legs, torso and head have
been joined. The black fur is neatly
smoothed, and Larry takes adeep
breath when he explains, “Kong’s
put together with mostly sticks and
hairpins." .

Beachboys In Concert: Return Of The Gods

BY RAYMOND ORKWIS

On the back of the J efferson‘Air-
plane’s Surrealistic Pillow album a
short and direct note reads: “Jerry
Garcia—Musical and Spiritual Ad-
visor.” Among the acknowledge-
ments on ‘the Spring album is
another short and sweet message
thanking “Brian” for “every-
thing.” This is the same Brian who
will be cited throughout the
article——Brian Wilson of ‘ Haw-
thorne, California, musical and
spiritual advisor to the Beach Boys,
an institution. who played at the
Civic Arena Wednesday night.

More than
any other Am-
erican musical
group , the
Beach Boys be-
came, like the
Beatles, a leg-
endintheir own .
time. A

The Beatles did it with Beatle

 

. music, the Beach Boys with surﬁn’

and car music. Both achieved
preeminence and each was some-
thing more than the sum of its parts.
John and Paul were the afflatus of
the Beatles, Brian provided the life
‘for the Beach Boys. ‘

In 1964 things got to be too much
for Brian. He had a nervous
breakdown. Frank Zappa wrote
that Touring Can Make You Crazy.

- It seems to have helped Brian reach
that state. Genius ﬁnished him off.

The trouble with genius is that it
creates vast and overwhelming
responsibilities—the better you
get, the better you must become.
Constant escalation. Reaching for
heaven. Brian knew he was damn
good, better than Phil Spector,

I V knew he’d have to keep getting

better, keep coming up with
something to top Pet Sounds. then
Good Vibrations, then Smiles, .
then...

Brian chose to retreat. Quit
touring; lay in his room for years;
consumed, drank in but let nothing
out; grewvwhalish and more insane.
Safe.

During this time his group grew
up. Little brother Carl learned a lot
from Brother Brian and took up the
reins of leadership. Under his
polished direction the Beach Boys
became a very professional rock
group, and this was especially
evident at concerts. Each time they
came to Pittsburgh they performed
ﬂawlessly, achieving a duplication
of the tight ‘harmonies that were
their signature and adequately
portraying the progressive back-
grounds in their music. Carl did
this.

Still, there was something
missing; a ﬂavor, a spirit. Wednes-
day evening that -spirit was present
for the first time in a Pittsburgh
concert. It is the anima that
pervaded Pet Sounds and Good
Vibrations. It is the vibrations
themselves. The reason is simple
and pure—the group was again
Brian's. He knew it. They knew it.
And if one listened with half an ear,
she knew it too. The Beach Boys
may well be the talent, but Brian is
surely the artistry.

I went to the show expecting more
of_ what I'd been getting over the
past four years from the Beach.
Boys. Beach Boy songs. I had
resigned myself to accepting the
great shows in which’I’d hear all my
favorites and the mandatory
chestnuts that never failed to
entertain, even when they did not
excite. It wasn’t the same

Wednesday. They didn’t just do the
songs, they accomplished them.
The seventeen people on stage
(five Beachboys; Charles Lloyd on
ﬂute and sax; Billy Hinsche on
keyboards, guitar and vocals; a
bassist; ﬁve horn players; a
percussionist; and two keyboard
players) were all clearly conducted
by Brian. Every “piece of music”
(as Mike Love dubbed God Only
Knows) was more than what it had
once been, or even what it seemed
to be. A magical zest informed the
performances and a subtle genius
carried the arrangements. (For
once they were better than the

lfelt like I had dreamed his physical
presence. Musically there could be
no doubts.

(For those who like to know such
things, Brian's voice is not what it
used to be. That innocent falsetto is
nowhere to be found and a lot of the
top end is shot or rough, like Harry
Nilsson’s. Brian's singing at times
had an amateur’ quality, but that
didn’t stop the songs, and the
singing, too, from being phenom-
enal. His whole ebullient
performance becomes all the more
stunning considering the intense
psychological strains by which

 

records.) A synergy of good
vibrations captured the audience
and the Beachboys and enlightened

-both groups. For two and a half

hours we were mythologized;
electrified by the force of Brian.‘

I thought perhaps it was some
new member of the group who
entered with arms held high and
vigorously above his head ala Billy
Grahamand who bounded about the
stage. I refused to believe it was
Brian Wilson. But when California
Curls raised that Great Wall of
Sound, Ilbegan to accept that I was
truly seeing him. By the end of the
eveamg. I was so overwhelmed that

    Foghat: The Boogie Gospel  

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

There seems to be one apparent
theme running through Foghat’s
hard driving music and high
powered stage act—the boogie, the
whole boogie and nothing but the
boogie. V

Ever since the core members of

.the band—rhythm-guitarist/ vocal-
ist Dave Perverett, bassist Tony
Stephens and drummer Roger
Earl—left England, and the more
laid black blues/rock of the Kim
Simmond’s dominated Savoy
Brown back in early 1972; Foghat,
with the assistance of slide

a guitarist supreme Rod Price, have

been stampeding through America
preaching _the gospel of boogie.
Musically, Foghat could hardly
be called an innovative band. But
what they’ve done with the

 
 

seemingly limited context of no
frills rock’n’boogie. combining it
with a 70’s rock star attire and
persistent hard rock roadwork,
makes them stand out more than
you'dthink.  , 

Their ﬁrst four albums, Foghat,

Rock n’ Roll, Energized and Rock
n’ Roll Outlaws. were for the most
part commercially ignored. But
Foghat seemed undaunted. They
took to the road after the release of
the first album, and have stayed
there ever since.

Although absolutely nothing was
happening with their albums,

Foghat averaged 250 one-nighters

from 1972 till 1975. In the process

they became a much-in-demand,
. 

 
   
      
 
 
 
  
   

Pictured are members of Foghat
who, after the success of their Fool
For The City album, have been
“stampeding through America
preaching the gospel of boogie.”

I goodtime opening act for such

groups as the Faces, Black Oak
Arkansas, The J. Geils Band and
Edgar Winter.

The heavy road schedule built up
a small cult following for the band,
but Foghat needed one break to put
them into the major leagues. That
break came in the form of their
1976 platinum album, Fool For The
City.

Fool For The City opened up the
sophisticated FM market that up

until then had shunned them. as .

being_too primitive, and one of

‘Fool’s"cuts. “Slow Ride" became a

major AM hit.

With the album’s success,
Foghat has moved into the
headliner slot.

The road seasoning has paid off
with sell-out crowds awaiting" the
band at nearly all tour stops.

In fact, Foghat’s stage tightness
is becoming legendary. Joe Fan
knows that he need not worry about
the band missing a beat due to stage
rustiness, or oo many evenings out

 
    

among the beautiful people in the
internationaljet-set. Foghat‘s act
is always honed and tuned like a
fine Swiss watch.

Foghat may not know Jackie
Onassis or Andy Warhol personal-
ly. but they haven't forgotten who
or what they are—a group of merry
music makers more at home
onstage in hicktown U.S.A. than
the guest list of a debutante ball in
the Waldorf.

gold tennis shoes. Perverett likes to
creep around stage like an Anglo
Chuck Berry.

...,(

Brian had been pressured these last
few years.)
After California Curls, they did

Darlin’, Sloop John B, Little Deace .

Coupe, In My Room, Sail on Sailor
(sung by Billy Hinsche), California
Saga, God only Knows (in some
ways‘ the most magical song of the
night, capturing the _ spiritual
texture of Pet Sounds,’ Airplane
(from the soon-to-be-released al-
bum, and a good, typically Brian
type of song), Back Home (on 15 Big
Ones,‘with Brian bouncing through
it on bass and lead vocals), Catch A
Wave, Suzy Cincinnati, and Be True
To Your School. Then came
intermission, and then side two.

— Side 2 stretched things out a bit,
was more loose and improvisitory in

and the mustachioed Price, often-
times look too weak; to crack an
eggshell. But never let it be said
that a Charles Atlas build is
required to play the type of non-stop
smokin’ sound these two are prone
to cook up.

if there is a flashier, more
proﬁcient rock ‘n roll drummer in
existence than Roger Earl, he has
yet to dawdle with the sticks. Earl
is prone toward green jerkin tops
and playing his drum kit with the
ferocity of a lion.

1976 was a good year for Foghat’.
1977 looks even better. The new
album. Night Shift. shipped gold
but the band hasn't retired to the
cozy. laid back syndrome of
success. They were here in
December and tonight they’re un-
doubtedly busting‘their butts
somewhere in the United States.

And in this day and age where
rock success is often judged by
what celebrity femme fatale you’re
dating. or how many chic parties
you’ve recently attended (are you

listening Rod. Paul and Mick?) a
rock n‘ roll band that just loves ,to_

quality, though not in arrangement
or performance. It began with lt’s
OK; A Casual Look, followed that,
and the “oldie” was followed by
another new Brian song, Love Is A
Woman. Then came a Mike
Love-penned tune, Everyone’s In
Love With You and it was lovely.

Mike introduced Charles Lloyd
after this and Carl led an
abbreviated ensemble through a
marvelously ﬂowing version of his
marvelously ﬂowing Feel Flows.
Lloyd blew a wonderful, watery
ﬂute solo. Carl's vocals were, as
usual, highly pretty. This segued
into an unexpected tune from Carl
and the Passions, All This is That,
and the transcendental message of
that song filled the bowl of the
Arena, no mean feat. -Both these
numbers held the audience com-
pletely and silently, another Her-
culean task.

Changing the pace, the group
launched into the up-tempo num-
bers, the ones that had the
hippodrome shaking in 4/4 time:
Surfer Gurl (not quite up-tempo,
but thrilling, especially to the
screaming gurls); Heroes and
Villains; Help Me Rhonda;
Wouldn_’t It Be Nice; Git Around;
Good Vibrations, and Surfin’ USA.
During Gold Vibrations, Dennis had
the crowd sing the slow chorus.
Thousands of voices joined in
concert and chanted .Brian’s
phrases more and more loudly each
time. The effect was pleasantly
strange, like a ride on a ferris wheel.
The song held true.

Encores are always demanded,

with the ritual invocation of ﬁre and

greeted by a surging wave of l

ecstatic roars, as if they were the
second coming. And in some ways

they are. The gods return. (Rock

music and professional‘ sports are
two of the rare ceremonies where
the gods. are tangible—and enter-
taining.) The Beach Boys returned,

Dennis sang You Are So Beautiful} A

the group swang in Barbara Ann,

Roclr’n Roll Music, Fun, Fun, Fun. _

Then they ascended back into

heaven, where it is always warm;

and sunny and the constant ocean
breaks in eternally perfect waves,
where all you got to do is “Catch a
wave‘ and you’re sittin’ on top 0’ the
world.” The myth and the magic.
Thanks, Brian, for everything.

Pitt One Step Ahead

BY JIM LEWIS

At the end of the rainbow lies a
pot of gold- 1

That’s not true with the Pitt
wrestling team.

Five foes have dared to venture
through the undefeated Panthers’
starting spectrum of talented
matmen, only to find disaster
waiting for them at the very
end-—disaster in the form of
heavyweight Mark Stepanovich.

Stepanovich has turned glitter-
ing victory into tarnished defeat for
poor Buffalo University (a 20-19
Pitt win) and Lycoming College (a
23-21 Panther conquest), taking
comeback straws from his team-
mates and making sure they were
weaved into Pitt’s win column.

It was a task at which
Rumplestiltskin would shrink. The
pressure in such positions must be
tremendous.

“In a situation like that, it's sink
or swim," Stepanovich said. “You
have to give it everything you got.
But the pressure is relaxed with
Bill Bailey (190) wrestling ahead of
me. I can count on him for either a
superior decision or a pin. All in all,
it’s lots of fun."

If so, then Stepanovich should
have a ﬁeld day today and
tomorrow, when the Panthers
begin a two-game weekend road
trip against tough Millersville State
and nationally awesome Lehigh——a
trip that could leave Stepanovich
very, very happy.

“Lehigh fans try to intimidate
wrestlers,” he accused. “They
have a small gym, so it looks like
there are a lot of people at their
matches when there are only a few.
And they’re obnoxious fans_——es-
pecially since beating a big-name

BY CRIS HALL

SYRACUSE—People who didn’t
know Tim Grgurich and his
seemingly endless enthusiasm
might pronounce him a doomed
man, considering the fate that
apparently lies before him.

His sentence: Take an inexper-
ienced 3-ll team around the
country the next few weeks to face

 

Siam dunks by Sonny Lewis will be hard to come by when the 3-11

school like Pitt is Lehigh’s bread
and butter. I really want to stick it
to ’em."

Stepanovich is an authority on
Lehigh. For two years he fought
with the Engineers for the Eastern
title as a member of the Navy
Midshipmen wrestling squad.

Pitt News

Sports

“It was a formal-type atmos-
phere ‘at Navy,” Stepanovich
recalled. “You always had to
conduct yourself as an officer
would. When you left practice at
Navy, you jumped back into your
uniform and into the military
atmosphere. If you didn’t take it
upon yourself to do things at Navy,
they didn't get done."

So Stepanovich left the disciplin-
ary air at Annapolis for the family
feeling at Pitt.

“It's more of a family-type
atmosphere, opposed to a business
one,” Stepanovich claimed.
“Here, there’s someone to help
you when you’re down. Coach
(Dave) Adams acts as a coach, yet
holds close relations with his team.
He asks our opinions and cheers for
us. It's a lot more enjoyable and
relaxed.” '

But now isn’t the time to relax;
the Panthers ﬁnish this season with
a killer schedule, including match-
es against powerhouses Penn

a schedule with more than a faint
resemblance to- the Utah State
prison riﬂe squad.

To be sure, there are a few duds
on the upcoming slate, but what
team is easy prey for a 3-11 team?

But there are no blanks among
Syracuse, Notre Dame. Cincinnati,
West Virginia and Maryland, all of
whom will take powerful shots at
Pitt in the next few weeks.

Panthers travel to Syracuse tomorrow night to try to ward off
_- embarrassment against the nationally-ranked Orangelnen.

State, Michigan, Clarion. and
Stepanovich's native Navy team.

“You got to go with who you're
with," Stepanovich stated. “Last
year, Pitt beat Navy for the ﬁrst
time in I don't know how many
years. I had just transfered from
the Naval Academy to Pitt, and it
was a big morale booster. I cheered
for Pitt, and a lot of friends I had
made on the Navy squad became
enemies."

The business at hand, however.
is Millersville and Lehigh. If the
Panthers display an impressive
showing against the two, who
knows how far Pitt can go?

“We have everything to gain,"
he assured. “It’s about time Pitt
has taken a stand in the East and
get what it deserves—recognition
as a power. The sooner the better.
I’m looking forward to the
weekend."

And the wealth it may bring.

   
   

Gettin’ Around

Will Hockey Club Melt
As Issues Burn On ?

BY STEVE srnmrr
Sports Editor

 

It’ s not one of the most burning issues surrounding the University, but
could be one of the oldest. On one side, you have a bunch of hungry
amateur athletes holding their hands out not for just a dime, but also for
a little recognition. And, on the other side, you have the miser—holding
back not only the money, but displaying a “don’t bother me kid”
attitude about the whole situation.

The case in point, as it has been for the past ﬁve years or so, is that of
the Pitt Hockey Club. And every year it’s the same story. The Club
barely makes it through the season, sometimes in the red ﬁnancially,
then starts all over again in ﬁnding from where funds will come in the
next season still a long way off.

Luckily, hockey has found a place in the heart of the Student
Government Board (SGB) and the student Allocations Committee,
which dispenses funds collected in the student activities fee from all
students.» Last summer, the SGB had planned to recommend to the
Allocations Committee that these funds be reduced in half, but a change
in the Club's luck actually got it about $2,000 more than its allocation of
last season.

  Panthers Easy Prey?

The first team with a crack at Pitt
is Syracuse, the last member in this
week’s Top Twenty and a team that
defeated West Virginia by 15
points last Saturday while Pitt was
becoming a Villanova victim.

The big factor behind Pitt's
undoing at Villanova was the
Panther's inability to handle a
Wildcat press. Syracuse’s Orange-
men hope that story is repeated
tomorrow night (8 o’clock tipoft).

“Of course, we’re expecting the
press from Syracuse," said Pan-
ther sophomore Wayne Williams.
“They have to, if they have any
sense. If I was Syracuse and had
scouted us in Philadelphia, I’d
press, too.

“But that doesn't mean it’s
going to work," cautioned Wil-
iams. ‘‘I think we'll handle it this
time.”

Williams’ 10-point performance
at Villanova was one of the
Panthers’ bright spots in the loss.
While top scorers Larry Harris and
Sonny lewis combined for only 14
points—with Harris doing all the
combining—Williams. Ed Scheuer-
mann and Mike Rice lifted their
averages with double-figure
nights.

But who’s to say the SGB will not again change its mind and give the
Hockey Club a big fat zero or an amount so insubstantial that it would
again (yawn!) endanger the future of hockey at Pitt. For the last ﬁve
years, it has been an uphill struggle for the dedicated members of the
Hockey Club to plant the sport on the Pitt campus along with not only the
big-time collegiate sports of football and basketball, but also the sports
which truly deserve the title Pitt Panthers.

The Pitt hockey players should be grateful to their fellow students
among the SGB _and Allocations Committee, but also should realize that
arrangement cannot go on for long. Unless the Club sometime soon
receives recognition from the Pitt athletic department, it will die a slow
death and experience its own undoing.

Currently, the Hockey Club is operated by students who try to do their
best, but tend to let important functions go undone because of their more
important commitment to schoolwork, jobs and other activities. And
there seems to be too many Indians and no chiefs within the Club
administration. Over the summer. a number of mixups left the team's
schedule incomplete going into the start of the 1976-77 season and the
annual New York City trip was almost washed out when the Club
assumed the teams they were planning to play had saved them ice time,
when indeed they hadn’t. Luckily, they were able to find several teams
willing and able to play them -‘ ,

Part of the schedule includes such teams as the Philadelphia Junior
Flyers, Mainline and the Jersey Gladiators—three amateur teams
known for their roughhousing, which the Club should evade if it wishes
to go varsity. They also scheduled Gannon on a home-and-home basis.
despite the memory of a bloody, game-ending brawl at the Alpine Arena
two years ago that sent several Pitt administrators in the stands to
wailing and gnashing their teeth and provoked their faculty advisor at
the time into resigning temporarily in a ﬁt of rage. Also, the
Pitt-Cleveland State game of January 15 had to be cancelled because
Cleveland had already scheduled Penn State-McKeesport that day. If
Pitt would go varsity, contracts would need to be signed with the
opposing team and the rink and there would no longer be worries of
sudden cancellations.

Over the past ﬁve years, the Hockey Club has compiled records of
4-3-1, 10-5-1, 19-2-1, 19-3-1, and 9-7-1. That’s five consecutive winning
seasons and four consecutive Western Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Hockey Association championships. The squad consists of the cream of
area high school hockey talent and a volunteer mentor who has been
coaching hockey for more years than even he would care‘to remember.
The team plays well on the ice, but sometimes still looks bad—dirty, torn
uniforms, unmatching pants and players with different styles of jerseys
with the same numbers do not reﬂect the integrity of the university they
are trying so hard to represent well.

According to Coach Len Barcalow, the Club's faculty advisor--Dr.
Harvey Wolfe——has.been in contact with Cas Myslinski and the Pitt
athletic department over the hockey funding issue. These talks, if
indeed they were held, will be explored at a later time. But right now,
the Hockey Club needs the support of the students and a great time to
begin would be tomorrow afternoon with the third annual Pitt
Invitational Tournament at the Civic Arena. Student tickets may be
purchased for $.30 (with ID) at the Student Union Ticket Ofﬁce or Gate 2,

BY JIM PANE

After a layoff of 31 days, the
Pitt Hockey Club will return to
action this weekend to host the third
annual Pitt Invitational at the Civic
Arena.

The tournament gets underway
tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 p.m.
with a game between a solid Ohio
University team and Penn State’s
JV’s (S-3-2). The once-beaten
Panthers will follow at 3:30 p.m. by
taking on an undefeated New
Church Academy squad.

The winners of the opening round
will advance to the 3:30 p.m.
championship game on Sunday,
preceded by the consolation game
at 1:30.

Even though the Panthers (5-1-1)
haven't seen game action since Dec.

22, when they concluded a
three-game sweep in New York,
head coach Len Barcalow is
confident that his team will be ready
to play.

“We never go out there thinking
we're going to get beat,” he said.
“We’ve had good practices and the
guys know what they’re doing out
there.”

If Pitt hopes to ﬁnd its way to the
championship game, they’ll have to
cool off a red-hot New Church team
that posts a 5-0-2 record, including
back-to-back victories earlier this
week.

To be successful, the Panther
scoring machine must soften up the
goaltending duo of Wayne Hyatt
and Robin Childs, whose goals
against averages per game are .95
and 1.8. resoegytivelv.

Barcalow will use three lines in
his efforts to chip away at the stone
wall in front of the New Church goal
with leading goal-getter Curt Hetz
(13 goals) and leading scorer Tom
Sherwin (24 points) holding the
biggest chisels.

Changes in the Panther lineup
will include Larry Gallick moving
from his center position to replace
Russ Stump in the defensive
corps, Billy Day returning to action
after a long absence and a
make-shift line yet to be divulged.

Marty Bradley will probably mind
the Pitt nets, depending on how
Larry Newe1l’s ankle injury
progresses.

The line of Derrick Blair, Mike
Hasen and leading scorer Paul
Jewell (17 points) will lead the
efforts of a New Church team which,

according to Coach Brian Schnarr,

has greatly improved over the
years.

“We’re stronger this year than
two years ago when we lost to Pitt,
6-2,” Schnarr said. “We’re looking
forward to the rematch and we think
we can give them a real tough go of
it.”

Barcalow’s game plan against
such efforts is simple, though.

“If we can poke a couple early
ones home and let them play
catch-up, it’ll be easy,”
predicted.

But no matter who’s playing
catch-up, the man behind the
Panther bench remains calm.

“When our guys are out on the
ice, they know what to do,”
Barcalow reasoned." “They don’t
