Cowell bill stalledin Senate

By Dan Wonders
Staff Writer

GOP leaders in the state Senate
said Tuesday that contrary to
earlier reports, they are not
opposed to legislation that would
require the University of
Pittsburgh and three other state-
related schools to fully disclose
their financial records.

Senate Majority Whip D.
Michael Fisher (R.—Allegheny
County) said the bill will be
considered, but resolving the
state's budget impasse must
come first.

“I wholeheartedly support this
legislation, but there are still
some concerns that need to be
addressed,” Fisher said.

Pitt ’92
budget
delayed

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

Pitt’s fiscal year 1992 budget is
temporarily on hold while
Pennsylvania legislators debate
the state budget.

It may be several weeks before
legislators, who have missed their
July 1 deadline, agree on a budget.
Pitt administrators need to know
the amount of the appropriation
Pitt will receive from the state
before the Board of Trustees can
approve a final university budget.

Vice President for Finance
Edward Hunia said that if the
state delay continues, Pitt may
have to enact a tentative budget.

“The university has to have a
budget to function,” I-lunia said.
“I don’t think we can wait much
longer than two weeks.”

The tentative budget would
have to be ﬂexible to allow for
changes after the state budget is
passed, Hunia said. The tentative
budget would probably include
this year’s tuition increase because
the university needs to begin
billing students for fall—semester
registration, Hunia said. Pitt would
wait until the state budget passed
to set faculty and staff salary
levels, Hunia said.

Pitt is expecting a $141.5 million
appropriation from Pennsylvania.
The university had originally
requested $159.4 million.

Pitt’s monthly state-appro-
priation payment for July will
probably be late because of the
budget delay. Hunia said delays
in state checks were not unusual
last year, when the the state was
facing a budget crunch.

“Pitt lost over a million dollars
in interest last year because of
state checks being late,” he said.

Majority Leader F. Joseph
Loeper (R.-Delaware County) had
indicated some opposition to the
Right-to Know provisions in
reports last week.

But Fisher said he and Loeper
want the state budget to be a
priority. 1

Fisher, who serves on Pitt’s
Board of Trustees, indicated some
questions will need to be resolved
before the amendment’s passage.

“For one thing, Pitt being a
state—related school is a hybrid,
and we need to be sure that
Right-to-Know can be applied
here like it is with Pennsy1vania’s
13 state-owned universities,”
Fisher said.

Fisher also questioned whether.

private contributions would be

made public.

“I’m not sure those making
donations to schools are going to
want to be publicized,” he said.

The amendment’s creator, Rep.
Ronald Cowell (D.-Wilkins),
doesn’t agree with the Republican
arguments.

“I see no excuse for delaying
the vote on this. There’s nothing
complicated about it, and similar
laws already cover other research
universities around the country
similar to Pitt.”

The amendment was
overwhelmingly approved in the
House last month by a 200-1 vote.

“I’m really disappointed the
Republican leadership in the
Senate is holding this up. They

First-year students  

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

The first experience at Pitt was an unsettling one for several
first-year students who were trapped in a Cathedral of Learning
elevator for over an hour last night.

Nineteen students crammed into the elevator and overloaded
it, said paramedic supervisor Ron Romano. The elevator, which
has a weight capacity of 4,000 pounds, was stuck between the
11th and 12th floors.

The students and their mentor were returning from a meeting
of the Quest program, which prepares minority students
interested in math and science for college. They entered the
elevator at around 8 p.m., and were crossing Bigelow Boulevard
by 9:15 p.m. .

One student hyperventilated in the elevator, but there were

no other injuries.

Pitt Assistant President Katrina
Veeder Schulhof is leaving the
university on Aug. 1 when John
Dennis O’Connor becomes
president.

It is commonplace for top
administrators to leave when a
new president comes to a
university, said Bob Reteshka of
University Relations yesterday.

“lO’Connor] wants to build his
own team of upper—level people
— it’s part of a transition,”
Reteshka said.

Reteshka said he is not sure of
Schulhofs plans for the future.
Schulhof was unavailable for
comment.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
had authorized severance
packages which would have
guaranteed a year’s salary for
Schulhof and four other university
officials, but Posvar rescinded the
offers after consulting with
O’Connor. '

BPC Wants Posvar’s raise tobe rescinded

By Jim Wechsler

Asst. News Editor

The University Senate’s budget~policies
committee wants a more in-depth disclosure
of outgoing President Wesley Posvar’s
retirement package and has asked for Posvar’s
latest raise to be taken away.

Edward L. Symons, chairperson of the BPC,
said the initial disclosure by the Board of
Trustees was a satisfactory summary, but
more information was necessary to understand
why and how decisions were made.

At a June 10 press conference, BOT
Chairperson John Marous said an informal
compensationcommittee, which didn't report
to the full board, created Posvar’s retirement

package..Marous said he was unaware of
Posvar’s settlement until it was revealed in the
media.

“It’s like a Readers Digest condensation of
Warand Peace, ” Symons said. “We asked for
a fuller disclosure.”

Symons said the BPC speciﬁcally wonders
how the Board of» Trustees’ compensation
committee determined a $201,600 post-
retirement annual salary for Posvar, and why
Pitt matched contributions to Posvar’s Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association/College
Retirement Equities Fund at a 4—to-1 ratio.

In a June 20 letter to vice president of
finance and treasurer Edward M. Hunia, the
BPC also questioned the authorization of
Posvar’s deferred—compensation plan. Symons

said it is “a bit unusual” for a university
employee to receive a deferred—compensation

retirement plan and a defined benefits package ‘

because both are designed to provide a
substantial income for a retiree. Posvar
reportedly will receive both. ,

Posvar contributed $98,224 to a TIAA—
CREEF plan during his 24-year tenure as
president. Pitt contributed $304,228, a higher
matched—funds ratio than the current 1.S—to-
1 ratio. .

Trustee Farrell Rubenstein said at aJune 10
press conference the difference in rates is due
to varied tax laws.

Hunia said he has been reviewing the
matter, but nothing has been ﬁnalized. Hunia

When you step inside Graham
English’s apartment, you can tell
he doesn’t get out much.

And although the television" is
always on, it’s not the daytime
soaps that keep him inside. His
living room looks much like any
other in South Oakland'— dark
carpet, dark furniture, simulated
wood-grain panels — but there
are a few exceptions.

‘Squeezed between the
television and the farthest wall

computer, an old Hammond
organ and a loudspeaker the size
of a- small oven.

In essence, his living room is
an amateur recording studio. “I
just stay here and play,” English
said, “and I listen to music. I’m
always listening to music.”

English, who plays saxophone
and piano, has been studying
music in Nathan Davis’ jazz-
studies program at Pitt and was
recently ‘awarded the Mellon
Bank—University of Pittsburghjazz
Scholarship.

The central division of the city

night in see—through blue plastic

These “blue bags” distinguish
the recyclables from other refuse,

detailing which materials are
acceptable for recycling and how
to properly dispose of them were
mailed to city residents in the
central division.

Multi—unit buildings may appear
as single residencies, Rizzuto said,
so only one pamphlet may have
been sent to some buildings.

Rizzuto said residents should
contact their landlords if they

have not received this
information, or they can phone
the city’s recycling division at
255-2631.

Bags that are improperly
prepared or that contain materials
other than those accepted by the
program will not be collected,
according to Rizzuto.

Instead, workers will attach
orange stickers to the bags
indicating the reason for
rejection.

“That’s our way of continuing
education. In most cases it’s
something small,” Rizzuto said.
Some residents, for example,

with the recyclable plastic milk
jugs.

The central division is made up
of 15 residential neighborhoods:
Bloomfield,
Lawrenceville, East Liberty,
Friendship, Garfield, Highland
Park, Morningside, Polish Hill,
Stanton Heights, the Hill District,
the Strip District and the
residential part of the central
business district.

Recycling has been mandatory
in other parts of the city of
Pittsburgh since September
1990.

Trustees John Arthur, former
chaiperson of Duquesne ‘Light
Co., and Donald Beall,
chairperson and chief executive
officer of Rockwell International
Corp., are also resigning.

According to Reteshka, Arthur

 is resigning because of “age

reasons.” Arthur is almost 70 years
old.

Beall is resigning because
Rockwell is relocating from
Pittsburgh to California, Reteshka
said. _ ,

Reteshka said he did not know

who would replace Arthur and
Beall, but “I can assure you, it’ll
be a wide—open process.”

A nominating committee will
submit the names of candidates
to the full Board of Trustees to fill
the two vacancies, said Lewis
Popper, university general
cou nsel and secretary to the board
of trustees..

But BOT Chairperson John
Marous said at a June 13 board
meeting that a committee will be
formed to review and re-structure
the board, and this committee
“could conceivably change

anything about the Board of
Trustees, including how the
nominating committee works,”
Popper said.

“The Board of Trustees might
want to wait until the committee
[to restructure the BOT] has done
its job before nominating any
new trustees,” Popper said.

According to Popper, there is
no deadline for replacing the
trustees, and there are no
candidates currently being
considered..

A ﬁnal decision will probably
not be made until the fall, Popper

Port Authority Transit’s ﬁnancial stability

. rides on two pieces of legislation currently

being debated in a State House committee.
“Pennmove,” which would*establish a
dedicated state funding source for public

. transit in Pennsylvania, has been approved

by the transportation committee and now

‘awaits a decision in the appropriations

committee. .

A .“If the bills pass, maintained fares could
be possible for the rest of the 1990s,” said
Jason Fincke, PAT’s manager of media
‘relations. “However, [PA'Il can't promise
anything because there are so many
variables in our budget. But if we do have
a dedicated funding system to work with,
we can plan for a more stable future."

According to Fincke, since Pennsylvania

is the only state that does not have a
dedicated funding system for metropolitan
cities, PAT has to rely more heavily on the

fare box than other transit systems do to
meet operating costs. _

PAT’s fares provide approximately 50
percent of its operating costs, compared
to the national average of 40 percent for
other cities.

Because of this reliance on commuter
fares, Pennsylvania has the highest fares
in the country; Philadelphia is the highest
with $1.50, and Pittsburgh is tied for
second with $1.25 for base fare.

With fares being “as high as they possibly

can be,” the bills must pass in order for ‘

PAT to be able to manage both immediate
and long-term funding crisis, Fincke said.

PAT currently receives $59 million from
the state, $20 million from the county and
$9 million from the federal government in
operational assistance funds. But Fincke
said rising costs and fluctuating economic
conditions make it difficult for PAT to plan
a long-term budget. -

-“If money is not put forth, there will
definitely be further deterioration of an

  

already insufficient transit service. Raising
' the fares is out of the question, and
additional service cuts would only hurt
the riders and the local community.

“Going by a year-to-year budget system,
we never know what’s going to happen.
The outlook for the end of this fiscal year
is uncertain. We could be facing a deficit
as high as $40 million. We don’t know yet;
we’ll have to wait to see what happens.
We need consistent funds so we know
what to predict,” Fincke said.

The “Pennmove” proposal includes H.B.
1486, which would earmark eligible funds
for public transit, and H.B. 1487, which
would distribute the funds on a formula
basis.

“Pennmove” would generate an
estimated $400 million annually for the
state's transit ‘agencies. PAT anticipates
approximately 25.4 percent or about $100
million of the funds per year.

Since a portion of the funds would be
used for asset maintenance, a new category

rm: PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, July 3, 1991

I Stutelilegliisilation would regulate PA

T bus fa res
under the proposal which covers operating
costs, Fincke said fare increases and service
cuts would no longer be necessary in
order to maintain a budget. A

In addition to providing funds to help
meet rising operating costs, Fincke said
money from the Pennmove funds would
enable PAT to begin work on several
capital projects including the “Spine Line,”
an extension of the subway system into
Oakland and Squirrel Hill, the Martin Luther
Kin gjr. Busway Extension, and the Airport
Busway.

State Representative Gordon Linton, chief
sponsor of “Pennmove,” was not available
for comment on the proposal’s status.
According to the Legislative Reference
Bureau , the proposal moved to’ the
appropriations committee on June 11 and
will be voted on soon. '

“If the bill passes, we’ll be in good
shape. If it doesn’t, we’re right back in the
yearly budget struggle, but this time, we’ll
be in worse shape,” Fincke said.

Q.

A legacy steps down...

Historic chance? Political risk? Or maybe just a Republican
choice?

When Supreme Court Justice T hurgood Marshall, 82,
announced his retirement last week, George Bush jumped
at the chance to nominate Clarence Thomas, 43, to replace
the remarkable man who had become the first black on
the most powerful court in America.

Marshall made the dreams of many minorities into
realities; His 50-year career consisted of fighting for
freedom of speech, affirmative action, banishment of the
death penalty and rights for crime suspects.

Marshall’s record for victory is impressive; of the 52
cases be brought ‘before the court, he won 29.

In 1937, Marshall marched into the governor’s office in
Dallas, Texas, and told him the story of a black man who
was kicked down the courthouse steps while reporting
for jury duty. Thatone case opened many doors for
Marshall, who went on to ensure equal pay for black and
white teachers and "fought segregated school systems to
force them to admit blacks. The Nation Association for the
Advancement of Colored People was where Marshall
found his niche, and he was praised for relating to people,
and not just their causes. . _

President Bush has been accused of selecting Thomas,
a conservative, because he is black. Bush denies this and
is adamant that he was not trying to meet a quota when he
nominated Thomas for the position. Bush has taken many
chances since he became president, such as his nomination
of David Souter to the Supreme Court, who was overly
secretive regarding his views on abortion and women’s
rights. His limited time on the bench leaves little judicial
record to investigate his beliefs on important issues.

It should also be considered whether or not Thomas will
help dismatntle»-the accomplishments that Marshall worked
so hard to build. “As a black man, Clarence Thomas
doesn’t share the the same views on some civil-rights
issues that Thurgood Marshall held,” said Melanne Verveer,

vice president of People _for the American Way, in the

Pittsburgh Post—Gazette yesterday. That statement
questions Thomas’ intentions and personal views on
many relevant debates this nation has endured and will
continue to endure” in the n_extfew years. ‘

Thomas’s upbringing could suggest that he is against
abortion. He prides himself on being Catholic and
conservative, and thanked his grandparents, his mother
and the nunswhen Bush made his announcement.

At a time when faith in the justice ‘system of‘America is
at an all-time low, it is a shame that age had to force a man
asxdependable and courageous as Thurgood Marshall
step down. We can only-hope that his successor will be as
adamant as he when fighting for the rights of the people. A

The Democrats are at it again.
Their latest assault on the
intelligence of Americans goes
under the name of the Civil Rights
Bill of 1991. The House passed

the bill on June 4 and sent it on to

the Senate. But the good news is
that the bill passed with less than
the two—thirds majority needed to
override the necessary and
inevitable presidential veto.

The object of this Democrat-

sponsorec,l_bill_ is to overturn ._six ,

Supreme Court decisions handed
down a few yearsago that let
businesses have a chance at
defending themselves from
lawsuits for alleged
discrimination. With this bill, a
business is going to be considered
“guilty until proven innocent,”
which is exactly opposite of how
justice is supposed to be served as
put forth in the Constitution and
our British common—law heritage.
The House version originally put
no limit on the amount of damages
that may be collected but this has
since been changed to incorporate
a $l50,00 cap. I’m”willing to bet
every lawyer in this country is
positively drooling over the
prospect of this bill becoming law.
If you think American society is
litigation-crazy now, wait until
something like this gets passed.
The fact is, this bill will not reduce
discrimination and prejudice but

actually encourage it by making it

look like minorities aren't capable
of getting jobs on their own merit

. and must have to depend on the

government to enforce their
hiring.

b”should not be law

  Gary
Houston

“This bill will not
. reduce
S discrimination
and prejudice but
  actually
encourage it”

The Democrats are accusing

V President Bush ofplaying politics

with his statements that this is a
quota bill so as to appeal to

’ mainstream white voters. But the

Democrats are guilty ofhypocrisy

-because one of the reasons they

are pushing this bill so hard is to
solidify their power. base of
special-interest groups in order
to minimize the beatingthey’re
sure to take in '92. What the
liberal "airheads don’t understand
is that civil rights do NOT stand
for preferential treatment. When
Bush says that this ‘is a quota bill,
he’s entirely correct. Oh, the
Democrats put a little phrase in it
banning quotas but-what isput in.
writing and‘. what happens in
reality are two different things.

If this bill became law, and as a
business owner you had to face
hordes of frenzied lawyers
running commercials like, “Are

you a minority or a woman and
you didn’t get that job you really
wanted? Come see us and we’ll

 get you (and 1) some money,”

what would you do? That’s right,
you would irlstitute discrete
hiring quotas to protect yourself.
Now do you understand Bush’s
warning?

Quotas are totally indefensible. '

You cannot logically or morally

justify hiring on the basis of at
pcrson’s race or gender. If "

American businesses are to
survive, they must be able to hire
the most qualified person,
regardless of race or sex. I refuse
to potentially lose a job
opportunity for injustices that
occurred waybefore I was born
and with which I had nothing to
do. This bill will undermine the
ability ofAmerican businesses to
remain competitive because the
government would have an
indirect say in who can be hired.
Merit alone should be the only‘
consideration in hiring
procedures. That would ensure
high—quality personnel for
businesses and keep the special-

interest group flunkies happy in ~

the process. . ‘
Civil rights are not just_ for
minorities, they’ are for‘

IEVIFZRYBOIDY. The Declaration
of Independence states that all
men (and women) are created
equal, but this bill would violate
that noble principle by making
so_me people more equal than
others. ’

Pitt track stars to compete in national andlinternational events,

By Brian Berger
Sports Editor

Flexing its running muscles, the
University of Pittsburgh will offer
six track athletes to various meets
this summer, including two
runners at the World University
Games, which take place in
London, England, next month.

Elbert Ellis, a four-time All-
American, and Keisha Demas,
who owns seven first-place
finishes in Big East competition
and is a two—time All—American,
will represent the Panthers
abroad.

Ellis, a North Carolina native, is
an eight—time Big East champion
including titles in the indoor 55-
meter and outdoor /1()0—meter
hurdles. This season Ellis finished
second in the 55m hurdles at both.
the IC/LA championships and at

the NCAA indoor track—and-field
finals.

Demas, who hails from
Brooklyn, N.Y., broke her own
Big East record in the 400 dash as
she ran it in 54.39 Seconds to
capture her fourth title in that
event and was named one of the
Big East Championship meet’s
most outstanding performers. She
placed seventh in this season’s
NCAA Championships, as she ran
a 53.75 to break the university
and Big East record for the third
time.

Brett Shields, Allison Williams
and Ronise Crumpler will
participate in the United States
Sports Festival in Los Angeles later
in the summer.

’ Shields, a senior out of
Harrisburg, placed fourth in both
the 55m hurdles and 400 dash at

Pirates pulling away in the East, but the fat lady hasn't sung

By Ryan Buncher
Sta_[f Writer‘).

The Pirates have survived the
off—season turmoil, struggles of
key players and the loss of Jeff
King to injury. They held on to a
lead despite struggling in a recent
string against the National League
West. T hey. even won yesterday
despite the Cubs’ use of their

A “perfect short reliever” outfielder

Doug Dascenzo (maybe he
should have been brought in
before the Bucs scored 13 runs).
They have baseball’s best record
again at 46-26, but the National
League East race is not over. It is
time to face the fact that the Mets
still have enough left to hang
around, and the St. Louis Cardinals
are for real. Either that or I am just
a serious pessimist—probably
both.

We are all aware that the Mets
have a terrible defense, but so do
the Dodgers, who seem about

~ . l

ready to run away with the NL
West. 1-lowardJohnson is leading
the league in home runs with 17
and second in RBIs with 55. Kevin
McReynolds has rebounded from
a slow start, and I-lubie Brooks is
still productive.

lfVince Coleman returns strong
from thedisabled list, and the
bats of Gregg Jeffries come alive,
they could make a run. The
second-half return of Sid
Fernandez, a quality pitcher
despite his annoying knack for
losing close games, should help,
at least by getting Ron Darling out
of the rotation.

Even with all their troubles, they
entered yesterday only 5 1/2
games back of the Pirates. One
thing that might knock the Mets
out of the race is the fact that
closer John Franco is struggling.
if he doesn't right himself, New
York can kiss the pennant race
goodbye. ,

The Cardinals have no such

problem with closer Lee Smith,
his usual dominating self. He
didn’t figure to have many games
to save this season, but the baby

‘birds have grown up all of a

sudden. Actually all the veterans
aren't gone. The pitching staff is
experienced and surprisingly
good for a team desperate enough
to use Jose DeLeon as a starter.

It has the best defense in the
National League, led by shortstop
Ozzie Smith, who has made only
one error all season. The aging
Smith may not continue to hit
over .330——Felix Jose might. Jose,
third baseman Todd Zeile, and
first baseman Pedro Guerrero give
the team a solid middle of the
lineup on a team that was leading
the league in hitting through last
Sunday.
’ Just think what they might have
done ifJoe Magrane were healthy,
and they hadn't decided to use
this as a rebuilding year.

Two teams expected to

contend, Chicago and Montreal,

have collapsed. The Cubs have

not gotten men on base ahead of
the big hitters in the middle of the
lineup. The pitching staff counted
far too heavily on injury-‘prone

starters Danny Jackson and Mike
If-larkey. I-Iarkey is done for the
season, as are the Cubbies.

The Expos have been hurt by
most of the players on their team
having bad years at once. Two
key RBI men, Tim Wallach and
Larry Walker, are key culprits. The

game of once imposing Andres
Galaraga continued todeteriorate
before he was injured.

The pitching staff, best in the
league last year, has fallen apart
with veterans Oil Can Boyd and
Tim Burke losing it, and
youngsters Brian_ Barnes, Chris

Nabholz and Bill Sampen not.

living up to the promise their

performances last year gave.
This team has enough talent

that it might pull it together in the

second half, but at 13 1/2 games
back now, it may be too late.
What about the Phillies? Can a
team be more cursed? That
pitching staff is curse enough, but
then they lost Lenny Dykstra and
Darren Daulton to a car accident
that could have cost the two
players much more than a few
broken bones and some playing
time. Von Hayes is gone for the
season, and his replacement, Wes
Chamberlain, just got hurt. Will
Dale Murphy, a great ballplayer

and member of the all—time good- ‘

guy team ever get to play for a
winner? '

By the way, wouldn’t he_ look
good as the Pirates No. 6 hitter
even if it means Bobby Bonilla
has to stay at third? Maybe a.
package of minor-league
shortstop Carlos Garcia, reliever
Jeff Neely and starter Rick Reed or
Paul Miller, prospects stuck_ in
positions of depth for the Bucs,
might interest Philadelphia.

Posvar’s retirement package.”
The BPC asked the committee
to retract Posvar’s $43,000 raise
for fiscal year 1991 because
department Chairpersons within
the faculty of arts and sciences
had earlier voted “no confidence”
in the president. The raise
represented a 17.8-percent

increase over his salary for FY
1991. At the time, the increase for
faculty salaries was 4 percent.

“You would think that the raise
was given for some articulated
reason,” Symons said. “_If someone
is performing satisfactorily, you
can articulate a reason for the
raise,” he added.

Continued from page 3
and didn’t have much in the way
of jazz or music instruction in
general. When I got to Pitt, Nathan
[Davis] really showed _me what I
had to work on and helped me

out a lot.” .
Posters of musicians are
common decor for any college
apartment, and English’s place is
no different. There’s Prince
framed in glass, a wall dedicated
to Jimi Hendrix and pictures of
John Coltrane on each of the

' kitchen cabinets.

But English does not admire
those musicians passively. He
has been pursuing their music,
learning their techniques,‘
imitatingtheirsolos andsampling

. their beats.

Pressing a key on one of his
synthesizers, English
demonstrated the rhythm sample
he'd taken from an old recording.

“A lot of people put the
sampling down,” English said.
“But I find it's just bringing old
music back in‘ a new context.
That music has been around a
long time, and that Hendrix beat
— by the time I’m done with it,
you won’t realize it’s Hendrix 
You might not know where it's
from, but when it comes together

in the final product, it's pretty
much original.”

English performs in the band
SoulAttraction, in which he plays
keyboards and saxophone.

“It's all old Motown stuff  like

the Supremes and Temp-

tations.”
Playing gigs, getting grants and

winning scholarships help English

buy time for his music.

“There was a chance I wasn't
going to be here [at Pitt] next year
without that scholarship,” he said.
“It was a blessing.”

Although his musical education
began with clarinet lessons in the
ﬁfth grade, English said he became
interested in music through more
informal inﬂuences. .

“There was a kid up the street
from me who played drums. He’s
on some albums now, an amazing‘
drummer. I’d see him with all his
friends jamming and I’d get my
friends together who could play

I a little bit of something, and we’d ,2"

  Cymbeline 

Continued from page 8
to wonder whether Cymbelme
hasn’t drifted into obscurity for
not—so-bad reasons.

Unfortunately for
Shakespeare, over time themes
like the star-crossed lovers, the
long-lost relation and the test
of a woman’s virtue have been
done frequently and with
greater success by playwrights

' like  well, Shakespeare!

In fact, in as far as cliché
situations are repeated
frequently, the experience is

' not totally unlike watching La

Bamba.

Our star;crossed lovers,
Imogen and Posthumous, are
virtually generic. They are
separated and punished by King
(Iymbeline, who disapproves
of his virtuous daughter's
marriage to Posthumous
because, while virtuous in his
own right, he is beneath her in
social standing. I

The villainous Iachimo has a
lot in common with Oz/9ello’s

Iago, intervening in a fiendish
way to ruin the lovers’
relationship.

By several strange twists of
fate, Imogen is reunited with
her long-presumed—dead
brothers, Guiderius and
Arviragus, who, as brave
warriors, so prove themselves
to their father that the discovery
of their blood ties is diminished
in scale to carry the impact of
an “added bonus.”

Imogen is pure as the driven
snow, while the queen is literally
an evil (not to mention
castrating) step-mother.

And on and on and on 

However, although the play
leaves a lot to be desired, it is
important to note that ‘the
production merits praise.

It is difficult to imagine
another company prodding an
audience, through Cymbelme
without the theatrical devices
employed here by The Young
Company.

Thom Delventhal skillfully

‘manage to slide in and out of

THE Prrr ‘NEWS, Wednesday, July 3,1991‘ ’

 

  

choreographs some excellent
fight scenes. /
Under his fight direction and
Jay Scott Chipman’s overall
direction, the blocking is
outstanding. During the course
of the performance, the actors

nearly every crevice in the
theater.

While some performances are
weak, character development
in other cases is exceptional.

The actors -- specifically
Thorn Delventhal (Cloten),
Mary A. Schafer (jailer), Greg
Longenhagen (Guiderius) and
David S. Jesse] (Arviragus) --
convey a unique sense of»
“having fun with the role.”

The Young Company’s
approach is to play with the
audience (as opposed to for
them), and that most definitely
works. The production is
generally engrossing.

Cymbeline will run-tb rough
July 13 at The Pit, formerly City

Theatre.

Simpson round out the cast and
are amusing as supporters for our
dense hero.

Camp is my favorite kind of
humor, so I loved this film. There’s
so much going in the background,
too, that it bears further viewing.

I Zucker has triumphed with his
sequel to Na/eecl Gun, returning to ,

the kind of humor he and his

brother made famous in such films’

as Airplane and the little-seen Top
Secret. This is definitely one
summer sequel that should be
seen sooner, not later.
