Complaints On
Dress For Ball

Student government's executive
committee‘ has issued a policy
statement concerning the dress re-
quirements for the upcoming
Christmas Ball, in answer to the
many complaints about the chang-
ing of the traditionally formal
dance to semi-formal.

The statement issued by SG

reads a3—.f0llOWSZ “It was decided __
that it was too late to change the ‘
dress back to formal, but that it_

was deﬁnitely necessary to point
out explicitly the meaning ’ of
‘semi’ in semi-formal.” A

“It means that men should wear
dark, conservative _suits, and the
Women should wear‘ cocktail

executive committee that this deﬁ-

nition is essential to preserve the

pomp andtradition of the dance.”
Men's Council originally took

a polite determine how many__
more students would attend the
dance, if the dress requirement

semi-formal. The results showed
that there would be a very sig-‘
niﬁcant increase in attendance.
Therefore, Men’s Ccuncil aban-
doned tradition, and made the
dress, requirement_ ~ semi-formal.
People reacted negatively to this
decision, because the Christmas
Ball is, the only “all-campus”

°No Recognition
Racial, Religious Restrictions  

The Student Senate will refuse recognition pbegignnirigl
January 1, 1966, to any campus organization whose constitu-V 
tion containsracial or religious restrictive clauses. The Senate ‘C i"

will also recommend that the

quorum was not challenged,

usual. Due to the absence of the
President a of the Senate, Phil
Brown, arts senior, was elected

’ President pro tem.

Two of the five resolutions were
passed. The-ﬁrst was: "That Stu-
dent Government establish a per-
manent Human, Relations Com-
mittee whose purpose would be to
promote understanding, ‘brother-
hood and more positive interac-
tion between the many groups re-
presentative of the University of
Pittsburgh.”

The second was: “That contin-
ued University recognition be
removed from any student group
Ithat is compelled by its consti-
tution, rituals, or government to
deny membership to any per-
son because of his race, religion

or nationality, by January 1,
1966.”

' V ,This last item -created consider-
able debate because it was felt
that it was slanted at fraternities
and sororities. The opinion‘ was
expressed ,that fraternities are
primarily social organizations in
which an attempt is made to bring
together students of common
backgrounds, and that forced
homogeneity would be undesir-
able.

"Proponents of the resolution
said, however, that -it would not
force integration on those that
did not want it, but. would
merely aﬂirm the right of fra-

ternities to pledge students re-

Three years ago, when I had the chance to _reread “The
Windin the Willows,” I was as convinced as I ‘was attseven

‘ that it was the {finest children’s book everwritten. It‘ was
sophisticated, exciting, and best of all, totally devoid of

‘ smarmy sentiment. ’
It was with some understandable misgivings, then, that

Hall,” A. _A. Milne’s., stage adapta-
tion of the book. And to some ex-
tent, I was justiﬁed; the play is
more Milne than Kenn~eth
Grahame, and a great deal of the
latter's robust humour has been
reduced tochristopher Robin pre-~
ciousness. '

But Milne, none the same, has
written an excellent play, for
children, ﬁlling it as he did with
comic songs and naive yetvwitty
action. And the University The-
atre has been equally successful
in keying it to a youthful audi-
ence. ,

The fine print on ,a postage stamp I saw re-
cently has provoked me to some subjective and

often angry thoughts.  A ’ g .'
The message on the stamp is a short remark
made by'Abraham Lincoln: “Those whodeny free-
dom to others deserve it not’'for, ‘ .
themselves.” It is, if you wish, ’
an expression. of justice without,
mercy. There are no qualinca-
tions to .it, .no_ egrcuses for
"‘exceptions.” ‘ ‘ ~
_ I immediately associated this K
harsh, judgment with several.
problems that have stirred great
controversy and emotion, one off '
them being the enslavement. of i
Eastern Europe by Soviet Russia
‘since 1945- Hene, the populations

 

/ .

of nearly a dozen countries havedbeen deprivedofi
their rights to live according to their own wishes.

« ' It is anadmittedly tragic situation. The Baltic
States lost their freedom hecause of size; for others,

the loss was brought about by. the‘ indifference of f

more ypowerful neighbors and geographic‘ mis-
fortune. . ~ e “ ‘ '

But there are those who fell into Soviet -hands V

because they» chose toignore the basic~truth of
L'mcoln’s words. It is almost theatrically ironic

that their campaigns of oppression ended withtheir ‘

own enslavement. » . . ~

Players’ Studio 

. . ' ~ ,7 . /-
Proves In formative
. , By CHUCK DUNBAR. ‘
Informative, rather than entertaining, is the word that
describes.the presentation of Bill Bowers’ play “Jus't'You.

and Me.” The performance, given last Saturday, was the
initial offering of the newly established Players’ Studio of

Bowers tried a novel idea. Since this was his first exper-
ience~ at directing _his own play,O ~-—'—-

BOWETS C311<3d £01‘ an Open dis-gher a job. and_ofl'cring her the

show. Caution and friendship
were cast aside as the audience
gave a very frank analysis.

The story centers around Flora
Harding, the proprietor of a gift
shop. The intrigue begins when
a certain Mr. Scott returns an
item for which there is no receipt
on ﬁle.

Further investigation by Flora
ascertains that the money was
taken by her seventeen year old
employee, Janet Adams, who of
course took the precaution to
make sure there was no record
of the transaction.

When Flora confronts Janet,
there is a nostalgic scene in which
Flora reminisces about Janet's
father, whom she was in love
with at one time. Into this scene
Bowers had inserted a contrived
dissertation on love which had
little transition connecting it with
the rest of the play.

This speech was too forced,
and it was very obvious that
Bowers wanted to work his be-
liefs into the actiongsomewhere,
somehow.

Anyway, it seems both Flora
and Janet’s mother were in love
with the same man, only Janct’s
mother married him. Flora tries to
win the daughter’s love by giving

cussion of the play following the‘

motherly love which her real
mother has forgotten. r. .

Jane-t confesses she has stole
the money to purchase a dress
that her mother would not buy for
her. For this crime she is forgiven,
and here ‘the play ends.

It was a weak play, with.notice-
able lapses in dialogue and char-
acter development. The twenty
minute productiondid not allow
enough time for the full exposi-
tion of patterns of emotional con-
flict.

The cast of Linda Lee, Paul
Kanfcr, Jucly- Stoner, and Lola
Matta were far from superior in
their performance. but allowances
must be made. They were work-
ing with diﬁicult matcrial,,notab1y
awkward speeches and obscured
emotions.

The Players‘ Studio is a Won-
derful opportunity for budding
playwrights or directors to view
their material on the stage. Cri-

ticism by the audience aifords the -

playwright a chance to adjust his
methods.

To quote an old saying, “Ex-
perience is the best teacher.” This
is certainly true in the case of
“Just You and Me,” and I am sure
Bill Bowers will agree.

Midday Seifies 

By PAT CHERKIN
The William Pitt -debate team:
and the debate team of the Uni-
versity College of the West Indies 
gave a demonstration debate at:
this week's Midday Series. Their:
topic was “Resolved: That’ United".
States Should Adopt A Program;
of Compulsbry Health A Insurance 1'
For All its Citizens.” 
Representing the West Indies on,
the affirmative sideiwere Selwyn‘;
Walter and Walter Rodney. Woody;
Turner and Leonard Bucki tooki
the negative side for Pitt. i
The West Indies team stressed?
that only 71 percent of the people:
in the United States are coveredf
by health insurance‘ and therefore 
advocated the compulsory policy.
Bucki and Turner, on the other
hand ,emphasized that the need in
major areas of the world is so
much greater than in the United
States that the US. should" nec-
essarily ‘extcnd its charity to
others;

Slaby stands 6-3" and weighs
 215 pounds while Maczuzak tow-

ers at 6’-5" and weighs 220
. pounds.

‘ ,“Although John Fridley and
Don Steinhart are capable re-
, bounders,” Timmons said, “we
f have to have boys with a little

.more weight, boys that are able

to move bodies.” _ ’
Timmons explained that this
does not mean that Fridley and
Steinhart will not be ﬁrst
stringers, but that both Slaby
and Maczuzak may see a lot of

action. '

“Both of these boys are strong,”
said Timmons, “but they need
. help perfecting certain skills. We
‘ i ‘haven’t had a lot of time to work
..with them because, they arrived
ﬂlate from ..football and then we
‘started our schedule. Once this
semester is over we will have
‘more time to give them individual
1 attention.”

. puzzling problem may be in soph-9

up against Army Friday. Army
lost 69-49 to St. John’s last Satur-
day, a team the Panthers are
scheduled to face on‘ Dec. 20.
Tom Maloney and Howard
Lockhart have been cited by
Timmons for outstanding play in
the first two games.
4 “They have been great help to
us so far,” said Timmons. “They
have come off the bench several
times to spark the team to rallies.
Either one of them could be a
starter this week, replacing Bob
Sankey who is having trouble
ﬁnding his shooting eye.”
Howard Lockhart is a 6-2 senior
from Pikeville, Ky. Last year
Coach Timmonsexpected to get a
lot of mileage from the southern
hustler, but he was ineligible for
the greater part of the season.
Tom Maloney is a 6-2 junior
from Dormont. Both Lockhart and
Maloney are lettermen but Ma-
loney just returned this year from
a two-year-stinlt in the Army.

As ‘Iron-Man’

Center Andy _Kuzneski, a junior
from Indiana, Pennsylvania, led
the Panthers in playing time in
1960 with 423 minutes to his credit
out of a possible 600 minutes.

This is the third time in, Coach
John Michelosen’s six-year tenure
as head‘coach that a center has led
the team in playing time. Charley
Brueckman, now with the Los
Angeles Chargers in the AFL, was
high in 1956 and Seraﬁno Fazio
captured the’ honors in 1959.
Tackles Bob Pollock in 1955 and
Jim McCusker in 1957 and Guard

John Guzik, a Los Angeles Ram,
in 1958 led their respective teams.

The 6'2", 209-pound center‘
was the only Cat to play more
than 400 minutes. Fullback Jim
Cunningham, who missed the
West Virginia game, was run-
ner-up with 398 minutes, tackle

Neiger’s Cat Cyrnnasts Polish  
Skills For Opener With N may

By LARRY HAGERTY 0

Although the first dual meet of
the upcoming season is still-more
than one month away, Coach War-
ren Neiger is busily preparing his
Panther gymnasts for the demand-
ing schedule which will confront
his Blue and Gold squad in 1961.

Highlighting the tough seven-
meet schedule will be Penn State,
the defending NCAA team cham-
pions, and the Cadets of Army.
who reign as the 1960 Eastern
team titleholders.

The Jungle Cat gymnasts face
the unpleasant task of meeting
ﬁve of their seven opponents ‘on
the road this season. Strangely
enough, the Panthers start the
1961 campaign at home with Navy
and Army and then ﬁnish the ‘sea-
son’ abroad with Georgia Tech,
West Virginia, Syracuse, Penn
State and Temple.

Last season the Blue and Gold
gymnasts captured four of their
seven dual meets. The. Jungle
Cats registered wins over Syra-

cuse, Temple,-West Virginia and
Springﬁeld while losses came at
.the hands of Army, Navy and
Penn State. Also, the Panthers
ﬁnished fourth in the six-team
Eastern Intercollegiate Gym-
nastics League behind .Army,
Penn State and Navy.

Neiger is faced with the prob-
lem of replacing last season’s one-
two co-captain punch of Dave

Hirst and Don Kasner.

Making up the nucleus of the
1961 squad are seniors Jack Rain-
aldi, Joe Battaglia and Ron
Daugherty and 'Junior Earl Mc-

Connell.

The depth of this season’s team
must be furnished by sophomores
and included in this group of up-
coming stars are John Lehner,
Ray Lombardi, John Patterson,
Bob Pingatore and F‘ward Za-
mecnik plus one or two others
whom Neiger didn’t care to re-

veal.

\ HAVE ALWAYS rum an
abiding hatred for the bottom crust
of rye bread. There is no particular
reason for making this point, except
that whenever I think of Fort
Laudcrdale, I think of rye bread.
There is no articular reason for that
either, but have been thinkin of
Fort Laudcrdale. Fort Lauderd e is
“where the boys are.” Right now,
that is. Most of the time, serenity

C reigns in Fort Laudcrdale. (The
Chamber of Commerce will hate me;
they say it never rains in Fort -
Laudcrdale.) But, for two weeks,
twenty thousand collegians descend
on this peaceful communityand take
it apart, peace by peace. They call
it Spring Vacation, but it’: more like
amateur night at Cape Canaveral.
They capture Florida and throw the
Keys away. But I’ shouldn’t jokc—-
not while people are holding mass
prayer meetings for an early hurri-
cane season.

This is “where the boys are.” And
girls, too. Such girls, it makes you
dizzy to look at them. If you look long
enough, you reach an‘ advanced
stage of dizziness called aphro-
dizzicr. It’s like being in love. That’:
what happened to me, and it will
happen to you, too. Everywhere you
turn-—beachcs full of them, motels
and hotels fiill of them, cars full of
them, pools full of them, bathing
suits full of them. Ah, bathing suits

. when the man said, ‘‘It’s the
little things in life that count,” he
must have been thinking of bathing
suits. But mostly, it’s the girls.

Girls in love, girls in trouble, bright
girls with a future, not-so-bright
girls with a past, rich girls in the lap
of luxury, poor girls in any lap
that’ll have them, girls of every size
1 and discretion. It isn’t any wonder
that this is “where the boys are."
And the things that happen are
wacky and wild and wicked and
warmly wonderful “where the boys
are.” Someone should make a movie
about it. Hey, someone did! M-G-M
calls it “Where The Boys Are,”
starring Dolores Hart, George Hamil-
ton, Yvette Mimicux, Jim Hutton,
Barbara Nichols, Paula Prentiss, with
Frank Gorshin and introducing popu-

Culprits Lose
Face With New
ID Cards '

By TED COLTON

Sports Editor

There were more than a thousand students at the basket-
ball game last Friday night, which is a considerable im-
provement over last year’s ﬁrst game attendance. This could
be ’an effect of the increasing student body living on campus
or it could be that the new identiﬁcation system that has
been put into effect this year islbackﬁring.

At the Army grid game the student attendance was at,

an all—time high. Many of the student invoices were not used
by students. Again at the Penn State game the student sec-
tion was ﬁlled, but somehow the State rooters inthe crowd
almost out-cheered the Pitt rooters.

The new ID system was put ‘into effect in order to sim-

‘ plify registration. The administration saidthat it would save

considerable time and they hoped that the student body
would not take advantage of an ID card that had no identiﬁ-
cation picture. ’

It did speed up registration, but now we have many
people who are not members of the student body sitting in
the places reserved for the students. '

If we are to have a better cheering section for our ath-
letic'events, it is essential that the study body be uniﬁed at
the sports contests. This cannot be done with the present
ID system.

Last Friday two invoices were hoisted when certain
students tried to‘slip them back outside so that their bud-
dies could use them. This may be bad, but at least these stu-
dentswere interested enough to come to the game. Most of
the students who give away their invoices don’t even bother
to come to the games at all. _ y

“We will be checking the people who come into Friday’s'
game with Army a lot closer than we were last week,” stated
an oﬁicial of the athletic department.

A “If we think there is anything suspicious about the per-'

son, he will berequired to show further identiﬁcation,” he
concluded.

The identiﬁcation system at Pitt has been a problem for
years. Last year the University came up with the best possi-
ble solution. i

There was a picture of the student on the face of the
card with 24 spaces that could be punched if an ath1etic.con-
test was attended. Each game had a specific number, which
eliminated the possibility of using the.card twice for the same
event. \

“Last year’s ID system was the best we have ever had,”
said another official in the athletic department. “We have
had more students coming to the football and basketball
games this year than we have ever had, but there is no way
of telling if they are really students.”

He continued, “I hope that we can go back to the old
system next year so that the real students will not be de-
prived of the choice seats at the football games and we will
be able to see if there has been a trend toward more students
attending all the games.”

By JIM O’BRIEN
When the trio of attendants
were saying “cheese” in re-

sponse to the please of the

cameraman, Norton Seaman,
former Panther gridiron cen-
ter , laughingly remarked,

“Hey , _. _ the Three Musketeers.”
Now Tom Murray, Bill Connors,

‘and John Streator, the men who

labor in the basket room at the
ﬁeld house, never yield swords,
but they are always well-equip-
ped with a generous supply of
barbs, quips, and satire to ﬁre at
over-anxious or Insolvent physical
education students.

The saying “One':for all, and
all for one” also applies to their
case studies. Besides working to-
gether harmoniously behind a
cage and locked doors, none of
them would relate any gossip
about the other for publication.

When someone hollers “Tom the
Bomb” at the ﬁeld house, they
are‘not referring to the Steelers
ﬁre-plug halfback, but they are
addressing Tom Murray, the dean
of the basket keepers.

Tom usually looks at you like
a snobbish aristocrat, but he’s
only focusing through his gold-
rimmed spectacles, which rest in
the shadow of a two-tone blue
yachman’s cap.

Tom has worked for the Uni-
versity since 1952, serving his ap-
prenticeship under instructor Leo

crew. “He was pulling a heavy

ﬁre hose one day,” “Horse” re-
called. “and it broke and, he got
a good shower right in the back
of the head.

“It was cold and he had icicles
all over him. I told him to get a
warm bath and go home. The
other fellows kidded him that it
was the only time that he ever
bathed.” '

Nowadays Tom handles the
equipment for basketball and is
presently getting the home uni-
forms ready for Friday's en’
counter with Army. But he
doesn’t have to slave over the
chores himself, for Bill “Boo”
Connors alternates with Tom on
handling the various duties.

“Boo” seems to be constantly
blushing as a‘ red-hue colors his
smiling face, which is accented
with large round eyeglasses.

The way “Boo” glides baskets
along the smooth counter surface
is reminiscent of the way bartend-
ers in the “roaring 20’s” shuffled
beer mugs along the bar. It’s not a
coincidence either, for “B00” was
once a bartender.

This year while watching the
Penn Statb freshman ridders
in action on the varsity practice
ﬁeld, he was called upon to man
a stretcher and carry two in-
jured players off the ﬁeld. The
incident was probably old stuff
to “Boo” who escorted many
“stiifs” through the swinging

doors in his earlier days.
“Boo,” who has ceased trying to
cover his bald spot with an adroit

sweep of a comb, has reasons ‘to
lose his hair. After the Boiler-
makers were nipped by Bob Tim-
mons’ crew last Friday,
American Terry Dischinger bang-
ed his ﬁsts against every locker
he passed, while “Boo” winced in
the background.

“Streetcar” is an unusual tag
for the other member of the tri-
umvirate, but that’s what -they
call John Streator, a part-time
helper. John retired from U.S.
Steel some years ago, but his ap-
pearance belies his 70 years.

The Mt. Washington resident
works only during the wrestling
season, seeing to it that the
players are outﬁtted properly.
“Rex Perry, the coach, will raise
hell,” Jdhn s.ighed,‘, “if a wrestler ,
appears on the mat with a small
hole in his tights.”

fellow always -wears suspenders

Expect Effects To

Dr. Klaus Hoffman, chairman
of the School of Medicine bio-
chemistry department said Mon-

on theclinical effect of ACTH
hormone in about ,two months.

“We will not be able to judge
the significance. of the synthetic
hormone until we can see if it
eliminates some of the side effects
caused by the present ACTH hor-
mone taken from animals,” Hoff-
man said. ’

The synthesis of ACTH. adreno=
corticotropichormone, was com-
pleted last week by Dr. Hoﬁxnan.’
working in conjunction with Dr.
Haruki Yajima and a group of
University researchers. A

ACTH is the hormones secreted
by the pituitary gland that causes
the adrenal gland to release cor-
tisone and other steriods into the
system. Th e. synthetic
ACTH was made by careful pre-
planncd construction of -23 of the
39 natural animo acids.

“We don't expect the synthetic
hormone to do miracles,” com-
mented Dr. Hoffman. “It can do
no more than the natural hor-
mone." _ i
