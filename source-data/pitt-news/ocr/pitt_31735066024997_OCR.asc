Artist Finely exposes oppression in society

By Kim Palmiero
Staff Writer

Performance artist Karen
Finely, who was denied
National Endowment for the
Arts funding because of the
controversial nature of her
material, spoke last night at
Carnegie Mellon.

Finley drew a crowd that
packed Skibo Hall’s ballroom
and elicited several rounds of
applause for her outspokenness
on women’s issues and gay
and lesbian rights. She criticized
the NEA for censoring what
she sees as art.

“More organizations are really
being audited and having their
funding stopped because
they’re presenting artists, similar
to myself, who either present a
political viewpoint that’s
different from the current
administration or if they are
minorities, gay and lesbian and
feminist,” Finely said.

She added that though much
art may be controversial, she
does not see it as threatening.

about thinking that the kind of
art that artists do now can be

Pitt students were urged to come to
grips with their potential as leaders by
author and political analyst Juan Williams
in a lecture Thursday sponsored by the
Black Action Society as part of Black
History Month. “Leadership requires that
you do something with it,” said Williams,
author of Eyes on the Prize and political
analyst for The Washington Post.

Williams reminded students that, as
young men, even Nelson Mandela and Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. were caught up in
their own everyday existence rather than
the struggle of an entire race.

Williams said when he metwith Mandela

that threatening. I never thought
of art as being that threatening;
I look at it as being thought-
provoking.”

Finely, who is in her late 30s,
grew up in Evans, 111., which
she described as a very
progressive area. She said she
has been a performance artist
since the age of 12.

Finely described herself as a
conceptual artist. She is
involved in a number of projects
besides her performances. She
writes plays and poems, does
sculptures and paintings, and
she sings —— once making a
record with Sinead O’Connor.

She said she was frustrated
as a young woman because
this is a society where “women
are treated like shit.”

Finely said when she was an
art student in San Francisco,
she could draw a naked woman
better than any of the men but
was not taken seriously.

She recounted, with disgust,
an incident in which an art
teacher told her, “As a woman,
art is good to have as a hobby.”

Finely said her art reflects
the anger

two years ago in South Africa, Mandela
admitted that as a teenager he had no
interest in politics and was only concerned
with rebelling against his parents.

“This great man had no idea he was
headed for greatness,” Williams said.

He also reminded the audience that
King needed to be talked into leading a
fight for the rights of Rosa Parks because
King felt he was too busy to get involved.

Williams said he was tired of hearing
excuses like, “If King were here  If
Malcolm X were here  If it were the ’60s,
things would be different.”

He urged the audience to stop making
excuses and to “take hold of this moment
in history.”

Williams said that challenges change

Artist Karen Finely speaks at CM's Skibo Hall last night.

Aatbor urges students to tap leadersb ip potential

with time. Thirty years ago, blacks had so
few rights that each person lived the
struggle of their race, he said.

“For you, as young people, it’s going to
be difﬁcult to go out there and find your
place,” Williams said. He explained that in
a society where blacks can obtain positions
of leadership, keeping close to the struggle
is harder. Many blacks who climb the
corporate ladder get too busy and caught
up in their new homes and cars to make
a difference.

He compared overlooking society’s
existing problems to taking a sleeping pill;
people ignore the presence of racism in
society’s music, media, sports, news and
politics.

UW ’s Shalala
opens Pitt
installation
celebration

By Kim Palmiero
Sta17‘Wriler
Challenges facing college

administrators, such as academic
integrity and multiculturalism, were
discussed by University of Wisconsin
Chancellor Donna E. Shalala on
Friday in the Cathedral of Learning.

“The Administration of Higher
Education in the Next Decade," the
topic of the discussion, included
panel members from Pitt and other
universities. The symposium marked
the first in a series that will explore
the future of higher education before
culminating with the installation of
Pitt PresidentJ. Dennis O'Connor on
Feb. 28.

Graduate School of Public I-lealth
Dean Donald Mattison served as
moderator for a panel discussion
which followed Shalala’s
presentation. Members of the panel
consisted of John Mack Kingsmore,
president of the Community College
of Allegheny County; John Marous,
chairperson of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees; James Mauch, a professor
of education at Pitt; andJohn Watkins,
president of California State
University.

Shalala, named one of the top five
business managers in higher
education by Business Week
Magazine, defined issues of
academic integrity within college
athletics as a key area which must be
focused on and more clearly deﬁned.

“People who lead educational
institutions these days are becoming
more responsible than ever about
intercollegiate athletics, and we must
be aware of problems that can arise
as a result of their strong place

Computing and Information Services braces for budget cuts

By Christine Hanna
Staﬁ" Writer

Despite a $300,000 budget cut,
Computing and Information
Services does not plan to eliminate
staff positions or reduce student
services for ﬁscal year 1993.

However some future CIS
projects may be in jeopardy.
Although CIS is planning to install
a computer lab in the new dorm,
the final decision will be made
after the budgeting process is
complete, according to CIS
Associate Vice President Paul
Stieman.

“We may not buy the computers
if we do not have the money for
staff," Stieman said.

CIS will need to make
adjustments to meet an operating
budget reduction of

approximately $307,500,
according to Stieman. CIS plans
to seek more funding to increase
the operating budget to cover
“mandated” costs amounting to
$317,000.

CIS also plans to request an
estimated $500,000 in additional
operating funds to support
expanded or new services.

“These numbers are not final. It
is a necessary part of the funding
model that we will have to do
some reducing,” Stieman said
during a presentation on budget
planning for FY1993.

In the budgeting process, CIS
will continue to develop an
environment that will benefit all
students, faculty and staff as well
as increase quality and meet or
exceed the expectations of the
people served, Stieman said.

“We want more people to
become involved in the whole
budgeting process,” Stieman said.

C15 is composed of five
departments: Academic
Computing, Administrative
Information Systems, Information
and Office Services, Systems and
Networks and
Telecommunications. These
departments employ 218 full-time
workers and 150 part—time
workers.

CIS runs the eight campus
computer labs, the university
business systems, the off—campus
computer systems and voice mail
for five campuses. It also produces
all CIS publications.

CIS also plays an important
role in the campus libraries and
Institutional Support
Enhancement.

Stieman said that CIS
emphasizes quality, not
technology.

“We do not want to be behind
and have to catch up, and we do
not want to be too far ahead and
spend the money,” he said.

According to Stieman, CIS
provides services to virtually every
member of the university
community directly and indirectly.
Even if students do not use the
computer labs, their $110
computer fee is not wasted,
according to Stieman, because
computer-fee funds are also used
for registration and transcript
services.

‘'It is important to us in CIS to
know that academics is the most
important,” Stieman said.

“There will be changes in our
services; no doubt about that,”

Stieman said. The changes will
be based on the needs of those
CIS serves, improvements of tech-
nology, modifications to its miss-
ion and the reality element of
available resources, he said.

CIS will continue to maintain
and develop an expert staff,
Stieman said.

Major CIS budgeting concerns
include how to meet the academic
computing needs of the regional
campuses, how to support the
growing demand for more access
to information and how to do
more with less.

“If we broaden services to
regional campuses, we do not
know how we will do it with
budget cuts,” Stieman said. “In
the short term we will have to live
with reduction and find ways to
be very efﬁcient.”

within the university,” she said.

Issues of equality should also
be addressed by college
administrators, Shalala said. She
criticized higher education for
moving slowly toward diversity

“Higher education has been
slow to respond to issues of
equity, whether it’s because of
the nature of how we’re organ-
ized, whether it’s because we’ve
been very insulated from the rest
of society on issues of access and
fairness to women and minorities,
it's clear that higher education
has been slow to respond in this
area,” Shalala said.

She added that universities must
do more to diversify by making
themselves more hospitable to
different kinds of people.

Shalala also talked about the
role government plays in higher
education.

“The issues of what the role of
the federal government should
ltakel in higher education, what
kinds of institutions should it
help and what kinds of students
it should help will be something

which must be addressed," she

said.
But Shalala said the
government does have a

responsibility to continue funding
and supporting research. She
recently spent time lobbying in
Washington to accent this point
and said, “The government has a
serious responsibility toward
funding research because it
affects our society so profoundly.”

She also discussed if graduates
are prepared to adapt to a world
which is becoming more multi-
cultural and global in perspective.

“My great concern is whether a
you rig graduate of our institution
in this new century will have the
kinds of tools they need to absorb
new knowledge, to be respectful
of other cultures and different
political philosophies, be
sophisticated about learning a
language and be able to absorb
new technologies. This is the
real test of quality education,”
she said.

Other members of the panel
also raised questions concerning
quality of education and diversity

    

Jason llillman/I'he Pittt News
John Watkins
as well as questions of money.

Kingsmore, in his 30th year as
president of CCAC, said, “We
must have an increased
participation of minorities in
education."

He also added that in hard
economic times, changes must
be made. “There is not question
that across the country officials
are saying this is a hard time and
we must make sacrifices,”
Kingsmore said.

Marous agreed that higher
education is facing tough financial
challenges. “Just as America is
being asked to cut their
economies, education is

supposed to improve.”

He cited the drop in state
funding which has occurred in
the past two years, saying these
are the largest cuts experienced
in 30 years.

One solution to dealing with
problems which face the future
ofhigher education, Marous said,
is creating an atmosphere of
shared dialogue with business
and community leaders to form
partnerships. “We can improve
efficiencies through partnerships
with private institutions.”

Mauch cited demographic
changes as presenting challenges
to higher education. He said that
one improvement for the future
would be to find “better ways of
incorporating minorities into the
mainstream."

Watkins said he agreed that
diversity is important and added
that it is important for universities
to “do what is required of us and
to take responsibility” ——
especially, he said, because, “We
live in an era of the culprit 
There is always someone else to
blame.”

Pitt educators honored for work

By Christine Hanna
Staff Writer

Eleven Pitt faculty members have received the
1992 Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching and
Research Awards for excelling in their work as
professors.

The awardees of the teaching awards are Joel
I. Abrams of the civil—engineering department,
Dennis Looney of the department of French and
Italian languages and literatu res, Beverly Michael
of the mathematics and statistics department,
Edward - Stricker of the behavioral-sciences
department, Judith Vollmer of Pitt—Greensburg’s
humanities division and Charles Watson of the

' surgery department in the University of Pittsburgh

School of Medicine.
“It is a very humbling experience to receive

this award; it is a great honor,” algebra Professor,

Michael said.

Michael has been teaching at Pitt for 12 years.
She said she incorporates modern techniques,
like computers and calculators, into the classes
and insures that each class is well organized.

“Math is beyond no student at Pitt,” Michael
said.

Looney, an Italian professor,‘ said he was very
ﬂattered and happy to receive this award. “There
are many people who are deserving of an award
like this,” he said. , A

“The most exciting thing for me is to see the
transformation ‘of students, from them not
knowing the language to becoming fluent,”
Looney said.

The awardees of the research awards in the
senior category are Theodore Cohen of the
chemistry department, Bernard Fisher of the
surgery department in the School of Medicine,
Walter Goldburg of the physics and astronomy
department and Alvin Roth of the economics

_ department.

The senior award is for faculty members who
have compiled a substantial and continuing
record of outstanding research and scholarly
activity.

“I am flattered. It is a pleasure to be in the
company of the others who received it. I work in
a good department. [This award] is a reflection of
where I work,” economics Professor Roth
said.

Watson said, “One never knows how these
things happen. I consider it a privilege at Pitt and
am overjoyed by this recognition. It almost
seems unfair to single one person out because
there are so many other good professors.” _

Cohen, who has been teaching at Pitt for 35
years, said he is very delighted to receive this
award.

"I am very excited about scientific experiments;
I do not let up. I have discovered a number of
new procedures and later have demonstrated
these new techniques,” Cohen said.

Goldburg said he was pleased to receive the
award. g _

“I like physics, and I like talking about physics
to anyone who will listen,’’ Goldburg said.

Goldburg has been teaching since 1964. He
said that whatever success he has had has been
achieved with the help of students.

The awardee of the research award in the
junior category is Graham Hatfull of the
department of biological sciences. This award is
given to “faculty members who have received
theirhighest degree within the last 10 years and
by virtue of the exceptional quality of their early
contributions  have demonstrated great potential
as scholars.”

Each award winner receives a $2,000 cash

award and a $3,000 grant to support their teaching

or research endeavors.

In the wake ofa crack down on
mothers who abuse drugs while
pregnant, Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
Associate Professor Iris Young
disputed the effectiveness and
justification of legal recourse in
such cases at a discussion last
Thursday.

According to Young, the
present justification for punishing
pregnant women who abuse
drugs is that it will deter other
pregnant women from doing the
same. '

“This presupposes, as all
deterrence arguments do, that a
criminal makes a rational cost-
benefit decision made by
criminals before they commit a

crime,” Young said.

Young said the only rational
decision an addicted mother will
make is to avoid seeking prenatal
care, where their drug use will be
discovered and reported.

The underlying motive for
punishment is retribution, Young

Profdecriespunisbin
pregnantdmgozlousers

 

said. "The average citizen’s gut
reaction to this problem is, ‘Slam

them in jail. How can anyone do ‘

that to a baby?”’ she said. _
Because the effects of drug use
during pregnancy to the child are
physical defects and mental
retardation, people are apt to
condemn the mother, Young said.
But she added that it iswrong to
hold women responsible for their
pregnancies because often they
are pressured or forced into
having‘ sex or not using
contraceptives. P
“If they arentehoosing what

causes pregnancy, then they aren’t ‘

choosing pregnancy," she said.»
Treatment and prevention are
the answers to the problem, not
prosecution, Young said.
Programs for addicted mothers
have improved since the problem
has become widely recognized
in the last few years.
"Previously, many drug-
treatment programs used to refuse
to take pregnant women because
of the liability," she said. “They
didn’t want to deal with the baby

Alpha Kappa Alpha celebrates 84 years of service

 

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February 24, 1992

 

By Kelli D. Herd

T For T be Pitt News

A forum addressing issues that
face the community, black
women and women as a whole
began Alpha Kappa Alpha
sorority's three—day celebration
honoring its 84 years of service
on Friday.

After a brief introduction, the

group of about 60 men and
women broke down into smaller
groups and discussed specific
problems within the
community and tried to offer
solutions.

Alma lllery Medical Director
Dr. Tanya Raggio led a discussion
on the health crisis within the
black community. According to
Raggio, the infant-mortality rate

is substantially higher for blacks
than for whites.

Late entry into prenatal care,
alcohol abuse, depression and
stress are all causes, she said. -

Raggio stressed the need to
educate women about
family planning and health
care.

Another group, headed by

psychologist Karen Miyares,
discussed the definition of the
family 20 years ago
and the present expanding
definition.

Miyares said, “The concept of
family is very broad.”

She said family can now mean
single mothers with children,
fathers with children or gay
and lesbian couples with

children.

The group discussed functional
and dysfunctional families. They
concluded that love, support,
acceptance and encouragement
are all essential in making a family
work.

Another topic, male and female
relationships, received the most
feedback.

The group, consisting of mostly
women, listed problems they’ve
experienced in relationships.
Social worker Jackie Blakey—
Johnson and teen sexuality
coordinator Ed Ford offered
solutions.

Johnson said, “Being
comfortable and happy with
yourself is the only way to a
successful relationship.”

Other groups discussed the
employment crisis, economic
empowerment and children’s
services.

Medical center honors
13 transplant recipients

By Vincent Gadrix
For the Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has performed
the world’s first and most successful series of small-intestine
transplants since May 1990.

The 13 recipients, whose ages range from one to 50 years,
were honored by the medical center last Thursday.

Prior to transplantation these patients suffered from short gut
syndrome, a condition caused by the surgical removal or
malfunction of the small intestine due to disease, injury or birth
defects.

The patients’ non-functioning intestines were unable to
absorb food. Nutrition was provided by Total Parental Nutrition,
a liquid that provides nutrition through a tube inserted into a
central vein. Long-term use of TPN may destroy the liver. Three
of the 13 patients are still receiving partial TPN.

Dr. John J. Fung, associate professor of surgery, said that
although intestinal transplantation is relatively new, the first
experimental transplant was performed over 30 years ago and
was outpaced by liver transplantation.

“Intestinal transplants have been considered a forbidden
organ, something that has not enjoyed much success. We
believe these patients represent a marked change in our
previous thoughts about intestinal transplantation,” he said.

Frankie Tavaglione, 5, is one of the six children who are
transplant recipients. His mother, Colleen, said because he was
born with short gut syndrome he had to have an intestine along
with a liver transplant.

“The wait was really scary. He waited a long time for organs.
By the time he had the transplant, he was just terrible. He was
very sick. He suffered nose bleeds, and his mouth bled,” she
said.

“Now he is doing great. We are working on feeding him and
teaching him how to eat. He will be able to live as normal as
possible. That is the reason we did it: for a normal life," she
said.

A luck of the Irish

More than 80 women a week, roughly 5,000 each year,

I leave the shores of Ireland, traveling to Britain for

abortion health-care services. Abortion is illegal in Ireland;
no exceptions are made. However with attitudes shifting

 _ in the abortion debate, Ireland may be forced to re-

evaluate its current anti-abortion policies and laws.

As of the past few weeks, Ireland’s politicians and
policymakers are in a quandary over their current abortion
resections. A pregnant 14-year-old is currently seeking

I 0. abortion services in Britain as so many women must do.

Even with her parents’ help, the High Court in Dublin
ruled that the young woman, a rape victim, cannot leave

, the country. The court prevented the woman’s parents

from aiding her trip to Britain; she cannot leave the
jurisdiction of Ireland’s court system.

Outraged, women's organizations and human-rights
organizations are demanding the woman be released

'-from “house arrest” in her own country. Ireland, not
known as a bastion of freedom, still prohibits divorce and

prosecutes sexual expression deviating from vaginal-
penile intercourse outside the context of marriage.

As a consequence of this human-rights travesty, the
European Community is likely to intervene. European
Community legislation guarantees basic rights, such as a
freedom of movement. On many occasions, the EC has
taken affirmative steps to protect basic human rights in

I A countries around the globe.

We agree action must be taken as soon as possible. As
the courts, 13C and Ireland’s politicians debate the situation,
a young woman continues to suffer a deprivation of
liberty. 'I'he unidentified woman is convent-educated,

I middle-class and from the Dublin area. For over two

years, she" faced sexual abuse from a family friend. It
ended with forced intercourse this past December.

On Jan. 27, the woman notified her parents of the
situation, and they agreed to travel to Britain for the
abortion procedure. Only because the rape was reported
to thepolice will Ireland’s medieval courts and politicians
become involved. It is already too late for legal action
regarding the rape.

Prior to 1983, abortion was illegal in this primarily
Catholic nation. In 1983, citizens voted 2-] to include a
constitutional provision denying access to abortion services
even outside Ireland’s borders. However despite this
popular ban on abortion in Ireland, most EC communities
have rather liberal reproductive policies respecting a
woman’s right of bodily autonomy. Abortion is legal, birth
control is readily available and sexuality education is the
norm among most IEC nations.

Ireland’s abortion debate echoes the battle in the United
States. Women are seen as incubators; fertilized eggs are
perceived to be babies. As long as Ireland continues to
terribly mistreat its female population by international
standards, swift action must be taken. The European
Community must enforce its human-rights mandates
against the Irish tyranny against a woman’s right to self-
determination. By allowing Ireland’s High Court ruling to
stand, women's lives are placed in jeopardy by forcing
them to seek illegal — and most likely unsafe — means
to terminate pregnancies.

notion that Americans act like
whiners about their place in

need Japanese politicians to tell me what is going
on. My experience with the modern American
worker proved this to me already.

I’ve worked in a steel mill, public works and
grounds crew to support my education. And my
experience has always been the same. While a few
try their best to do their best, others inevitably drag
them down.

All this stems from the fact that Americans have
to be the laziest people on this planet.

Some will claim that the good ol’ U.S. of A. has
been the greatest nation on earth. Others will point
to lazier people.

Many will call me a hypocrite and insist that I’m
just as lazy as any other American. All this is sheer
folly. It reflects the symptoms of avoiding the issue
and passing the buck, two major methods the
American worker uses to get out of work.

Since when have we been the greatest producer?
Since when have our merchandise, services and
expertise been acclaimed worldwide?

What is the worldwide reputation of the American
worker?

We all know who leads in those departments,
and don’t use excuses to justify it. Japan may be
ultra—protectionist with unfairly interlocking
corporations and a user of methods and tactics
unwelcome in the previously U.S.—dominated world
market, but no one is around to tell us we can’t do
the same. Once we did anything to stay on top, but

want but refuse to make it that
way themselves anymore.

The American Dream was an idea that America’s
roads were paved in gold; a benevolent government
existed by, for and of the people; working hard
made you rich. People were brought in because
there was enough to go around. You lived not for
today but for tomorrow, when you and your
children could enjoy the rest.

Now look at it! Once Americans worked 12 hours
a day in dangerous conditions. Now they may work
four, not counting the breaks for start—up, coffee,
lunch and waiting to punch out. Once workers
took pride in what they accomplished and how
they supported their family.

Now they take glee in the amount of work they
can avoid. They drive home in their inexpensive,
well-working foreign cars and are ﬁlled with patriotic
pride when they hear a politician berate the unfair
trading practices of other nations. A They don’t
realize how lazy we’ve all become.

Sadly, a major player in the attitudes of American
workers are the unions. Once they made life less
dangerous and more rewarding for workers. Then
they insisted on making work as easy as possible
and expecting the same level of pay.

Unions are incredibly conformist, bringing all
their members to the lowest common denominator
in terms of work and bringing down those who try
to do more. As I’ve been told, a union is a lazy man's
dream. It mustbe a cause of this American nightmare.

Smashing Success

Men is swimming

By Jim Lakely
Staff‘ Writer

The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team capped off a decade
of dominance by blowing away
second-place Villanova by 277.5
points to capture its 10th straight

Big East conference
championship at Trees Hall last
night.

Exceeding Big East Coach of
the Year Chuck Knoles’ prophesy
of a 200-point margin of victory,
Pitt tallied 854.5 points to second-
place finisher Villanova’s 577.
Miami placed third with 552
points, and Syracuse, the only
other team considered an even
marginal contender, finished
fourth with 424 points.

“The team came together real
well,” said first-year student Matt
Brady. “We swam great. We blew
them away. We are pretty damn
happy-”

“The team performed
magniﬁcently,” Knoles said. “It
was nice to watch the guys rise to
the occasion and stay focused
throughout the meet.” ‘

Staying in focus was the only
challenge for Pitt because the
outcome of the meet was pretty
apparent after the first full day of
swimming. On Friday the team of

Joe Kozlina, David Dodson, Zac _

Economos and Eric Cornell began
the rout by setting a new meet

free relay. This was the first of 12
Panther victories in the 20 events.

has been the sprint freestyle

[leading], and that says something
about the other teams we are
swimming against,” he said. “We
can swim mediocre times and
still score points on them. We are
just killing everybody.”

Knoles agreed that the
competition was not good enough
to really push his swimmers but

and the rest of the conference
may not be that far off.

“It is hard to stay focused when
you get in a situation like that,”
Knoles said. “lWel look beyond
the Big East Championships when
everyone else focuses in on this
meet. I think it took a little bit of
an edge off of what we were
doing. Our guys were sitting in
the stands with sullen looks on
their faces because they didn't go
as fast as they wanted to go. We
won the meet by 300 points, and
they were still sullen about the
whole thing.”

One swimmer perhaps not
quite as somber was I-Eric “Cubby”

JAMAICA, N.Y. — Maybe if Pitt head
coach Paul Evans can convince his players
in his pregame speech that they are going
out to play the second half, his team can
break its current tailspin.

As things stand right now, the Panthers
(15-12 overall, 7-7 in the Big East) need
something to jumpstart them before the
game if they are to break their current
three-game losing streak. In each of the
past three games, Pitt has come out cold,
falling behind too far to rebound.

Against St. John’s in Fitzgerald Field
House, Pitt started flat while the Johnnies
were red-hot.

The Panthers sputtered in the 10-point,
84-74 loss. Monday night, they shot 15.6
percent from the floor in the first half,
losing 82-63 to Seton Hall.

Saturday was no different, as the Panthers
took 13: 18 to score 10 points while allowing
St. John’s (16~7 overall, 10-5 in the
conference) to score 50 in the same amount
of time.

Pitt made a valiant effort to come back,
but to no avail, dropping the second
meeting of the season to St. John's, 71-65.

“I thought we stunk in every phase of
the game in the first half,” Evans said. “We
couldn’t score. We couldn’t rebound. We
couldn’t pass — nothing went right.”

One big statistic that stuck out was
senior point guard Sean Miller's line in the
halftime box score.

At the end of the first half, Miller had

Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s swim team’s string
of nine consecutive Big East
championships came to an end this
weekend, as Villanova captured its first
league crown at Trees Pool yesterday.
The Wildcats, led by Swimmer of the
Meet Lisa Flood, bested conference
newcomer Miami 682-640, while the
Panthers finished in third place with
587 points.

Flood, a sophomore from Canada,
defended her title as the meet’s
outstanding swimmer, getting wins in
three events: the 100- and 200-yard
breaststroke and the 200 individual
medley.

Miami, competing in its first league
meet, rode the efforts of a core of
outstanding divers to come in second
place overall. Led by the two f irst-place
finishes of Diver of the Meet Robbi
Dalton, the Hurricanes dominated both
boards, placing 1-2-4 in the 1-meter
and an even better 1-2-3-4 in the 3-
meter.

JAMAICA, .\'.Y. -—'l'he Pitt Lady
Panthers’ struggle to move up in
the Big East conference standings
has become even tougher
following Saturday’s 77-69 loss to
the St. John’s Express.

Pitt (9-16 overall, 5-11 in Big
East play) needed a win against
St. John's (1/i-1] overall, 7-9 in
conference action) to gain a
higher seeding in the Big East
tournament, which starts March 7
at the University of Connecticut
in Storrs. Now, instead of facing
a team like Villanova or St. John's,
the Lady Panthers face the
prospect of playing a more
powerful squad, like Georgetown
or Providence, which has
knocked the Lady Panthers out
of the tournament the last two
years.

As has been the case for much
of this season, the Lady Panthers’
offense failed against the lixpress.

kept ‘them in the game through
the first period, and St. john’s
only enjoyed a five-point, 33-28
halftime lead.

Both teams fought back and
forth for the first five minutes of
the second period. lip until that
point, the largest lead the Express
held was nine points. However
with 14:29 showing on the game
clock, forward Cozette Ballentine
made a driving layup to ignite a
16-4 St. John’s run.

That streak lasted 5:17 and gave
the Express their largest advantage
of the game, a 17-point, 59-42
edge, which they never
relinquished.

Pitt tried to cut into the lead,
but could only get ‘it down to six
points on two occasions. The first
was when forwardjill Colabrese
nailed her first of two three-
pointers with /1:40 to play, making
it 60-54. After a Pam Odom one-
hander made it 62-54, Lady
Panthers forwardjonna Huemrich
canned an eight-footer in the
paint, cutting the lead back to six,
62-56.

However Ballentine responded
to Pitt’s charge and was fouled by
Lady Panther guard Carol Morton
on a successful pull—up bank shot
of her own. The resulting free
throw put St. John's safely ahead
by nine.

“We thought that we could
match up well with this team,”
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said.
“However our offense left us,
and we had to try and do
something defensively. That
worked for a while, but it wasn't
enough to get us back."

The Lady Panthers made a
switch by applying full-court
pressure to the Express’ first-year
point guard, Marcia Price. The
result proved to be slightly
effective, but not enough to make
up the existing deficit.

‘‘We feel if we can keep it
within five points, we're still in
the game,” Bruce said. “However
we let them get too far out in
front and put the game out of
reach, and it was just too much to
come back from.”

Ballentine led all scorers,

Eddy Panthers derailed by Express

finishing with 33 points to go
with 11 rebounds. She scored 22
of her total in the second half and
six during the run early in the
second halfwhich helped put the
game out of reach.

“She’s just such a good player,”
Bruce said. “Sometimes she’s real
good and she’ll kill you, and
sometimes she’s not. She just got
into one of those really good
days, and she hurt us.”

Not to be outdone, Pitt’s Jonna
Huemrich scored 25 points of her
own to lead her team, despite
playing the last nine minutes of
the second half with four fouls.
Huemrich ﬁnished with only three
rebounds, one in the second half.

“Jonna is so capable of so
much,” Bruce said. “She can go
out there and do so many different
things for you. She can go out
there and perform at a new level
every time. However she still has
her lapses where she gets too
emotional. That’s why she picked
up her fourth foul so early. She
wasn't thinking on defense, and
that got her into trouble.”

relay team with his surprise
second—place finish in the
200 freestyle.

Syracuse’s Jay Craft
earned Swimmer of the
Meet honors by winning
three individual events.
Although Brady matched
his victory total, the votes
went to the junior, Craft.

“It’s no big deal,” Brady
said about not winning the
award. “I’ve got three more
years to swim. He is going
to set a record for most
wins, and a couple of years
down the road I am going
to break it, so I am not
worried about that."

To no one’s surprise,
Miami’s men swept the
diving events. Dean Panero,
the Diver of the Meet, won
the 1—meter board
competition with 588.20
points. José Gil and Brian
Ramos finished second and
third, respectively. Gil
bested Panero on the 3-
meter board by a scant 15
points, while Ramos again
finished third. Pitt’s Sean
Braud placed fourth on the
1- and ?;—meter boards, and
teammates Mike Naylor and
Phil Cruz filled out the fifth
and sixth slots.

“Overall this meet went
very well,” said diving coach
Julian Krug. “I knew coming
in here that Miami is the
best team in the country,
and theyproved it. We are
on our way to having a
successful NCAA qualifying
meet ourselves."

With a 10th banner to
hang over the pool, Knoles
said he is looking forward
to a bright future.

“This is a transition year
for us,” he said. “We can
truly say that we’re now
recognized as a top 25
swimming power, and we
are headed on for bigger
and better things, like the
top 15. Now not only can
the Big East be known for
football and basketball, but
now we can be known for
swimming.”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, February 20, 1992

 

Women

Continued from page 7
was too much to overcome,
despite the fact that the team
swam by far its best meet of the
year. And while Pitt head coach
David Belowich was impressed
by the performance of the new
champs, he could not have been
prouder of the efforts of his team.

“This team did way beyond
what everyone around them
would have thought they were
capable of doing," Belowich said.

“I’m very, very pleased with every _

one of them. We did not have a
bad swim all weekend.”

Pitt’s most impressive
performance all weekend, came
from first-year swimmer Christy
Knobloch, who placed second in

three events: 100- and 200-yard '

backstroke and 200 butterﬂy. In
addition, her time of 2:03.30 in
the 200 backstroke qualified for
NCAA consideration. Despite the
loss, Knobloch was all smiles
about the efforts put forth by her
and her teammates.

“I’m just so happy with how I
swam and how all the girls did
this year,” Knobloch said. “I
wouldn’t trade them for the
world.”

For Knobloch, the difference
in the meet came down to nothing
more than Villanova’s team depth.

“We didn’t have the depth that
they had,” Knobloch said. “That’s
the only reason they won. We
had everything else.”

Villanova used its team depth
on the final day of competition to
overcome a 50-point deficit to

Miami.

In addition to Flood’s 200
breaststroke victory, the Wildcats
placed four point scorers in the
200 butterfly, while a Hurricane
swim team boasting a meet—low
10 swimmers placed none. That
combination, along with ‘Cat Mary
Dowling’s first-place finish in the
1,650 freestyle event, was more
than enough to propel the ‘Nova
past Miami.

While one could split hairs
finding out why ‘Nova won or
why Pitt lost, Panther co-captain
Laura-Lee Sullivan couldn’t put
her finger on one big reason for
the outcome of the meet:

“I don’t know why they won,”
Sullivan said. “I guess for the
three days we were here, a couple
of teams were better.”

One of Pitt’s best breaststroke
specialists ever, Sullivan placed
fourth in the 100 breaststroke,
fifth in the 200 breast stroke and
seventh in the 200 individual
medley. Looking back on the
final meet of her career, Sullivan
chose to unselfishly shower
accolades on her teammates
rather than ponder her four years
as a.Panther.

, “I am so proud of our team and
how we’ve. competed,” Sullivan
said. “I was glad to be a part ofit.”

Every Pitt team member has
reason to be proud of her efforts,
especially when reviewing Pitt’s
overall point total —— which
included zero f1rst—place finishes.
Eighteen of the 19 athletes
competing for Pitt scored points,

with several team members
placing in three different events.
Among those who contributed
with fine efforts for Pitt are Jen
Burns (fourth — 100 free, ﬁfth -
100 back), Vicky Geubtner (sixth
- 100 back and 100 free), Laura
Zdyb (third - 400 IM), Crit
Gallagher (fifth — 50 free), Noelle
Barry (seventh - 100 fly), Janine

Atiyeh (sixth - 200 back), Clare

McShane (seventh - 100 free) and
Margaret McClurg (seventh - 1,650
free).

Pitt’s diving trio of Donna
Flatch, Kara Sixbury and Anne
Marie Rose also had an
outstanding weekend.

In the 1- and 3-meter boards,
respectively, Flatch placed fifth
and sixth, Sixbury placed eighth
and ﬁfth and Rose placed ninth
and seventh. Diving coach Julian
Krug said the efforts of his divers
were more than he expected.

“We dove much better than I
expected,” Krug said. “I

.anticipated Donna doing well,

but the two [first-year divers, Kara
and Anne Marie], I wasn’t so Sure
about. . . After seeing them
perform, I can say that they both
came through very well for us,
especially on the 3-meter.”
Another first-year athlete who
stepped it up a notch was
Geubtner, who achieved career-
bests in her three events. On the
meet’s outcome, Geubtner found
that the final score on the
scoreboard was not indicative of
what the meet was really about,
and what the Pitt women achieved

as a team.

“I think we won because we
came together as a team,”
Geubtner said. “From what I
understand, [team unity] is not
much ofa tradition for Pitt. I think
we started a new tradition —
being close and caring for
everyone.

‘‘In that respect, we all think
that we won — in our heart, as a
team,” Geubtner said.

For a team that lost a
championship, there were no
outward signs of depression, as
attested by Sullivan: “I’m not
gonna hang my head. I’ve done
everything I wanted to do, and
I’m gonna walk out of here

happy.”

Game
Continued from page 7
zero points, one rebound, three

assists and four turnovers.

By the end of the game, his
numbers had improved, though.
Miller ended with three points
(all from the foul line), four
rebounds, eight assists and four
turnovers. This performance

‘ followed last week’s carcer—high

25 points against the johnnies
and a week-long battle with the
ﬂu, which limited his playing

time against the ‘Hall and caused
him to miss practice.

‘‘I think Sean missing the week
of practice hurt us. as much as
anything,” Evans said. .“Sean
seemed out of synch, and the rest
of the team did, too. When he got
back into it, everyone else seemed
to follow.’’

At the half, Evans made a
defensive adjustment. I-le decided
to scrap the man-to-man defense
his team had been running in

favor of a zone. The decision was
made for two reasons:

1. The Panthers did not match
up well against a smaller, quicker
St. John's lineup of guards Derek
Brown, Jason Buchanan and
Chuck Sproling with forwards
Malik Sealy and Lamont
Middleton

2. Pitt was tired and needed
the zone, which requires less
movement, to get its legs back.

“We just don't play zone very

well. That's why we didn’t go to
it sooner,” Evans said. “However
it worked better against that lineup
they were playing, and it helped
us do other things better.”
Three players who stepped it
up in the second half to help the
Panthers get back into the game
were Darren Morningstar, Chris
McNeal and Orlando Antigua.
After strug_gling to regain his
confidence, Morningstar
benefited from the foul trouble
that St. John’s’ Shawnelle Scott,
who dominated the paint for 15
points and 15 boards last week,
and Mitchell Foster got themselves
into. , «
After scoring just two points

and grabbing three boards in the

first half, Morningstar finished
with 11 points and eight boards.

McNeal has done a steady
disappearing act since conference

play has begun.

After dominating opponents
early in the season, McNeal has
been the one pushed around for
most of the past three games.

He turned in a strong 12-point,
seven-rebound performance,
leading to hope that maybe he
will return to his form from earlier
in the season.

Playing his first game in Alumni
Hall, Antigua did not seem
daunted at all by the crowd of
6,008 hostile fans. He played an
instrumental role in Pitt's
comeback, hitting a two clutch
three—pointers to pull the Panthers
back into it.

However the first-half deﬁcit
proved to be too big of a gap to
fill. The Johnnies, led by Sealy
with 22, made key baskets to
help squelch Pitt runs, finishing
with the wire-to-wire victory.
