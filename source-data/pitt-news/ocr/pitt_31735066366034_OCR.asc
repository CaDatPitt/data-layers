consider a proposal to grant Dr.
Elizabeth Arthur anotheryear to
‘perform research before making
a final tenure recommendation to
.theDean.

\

Arthur, an assistant professor-

and head of the biology depart-
ment undergraduate advising cen-
tdr. asked for the one year exten-
sion after the department chose
not to recommend her for tenure
several weeks ago.

’ Monday’s decision has not been
released becasue the absentee
ballots of two professors have not

-been received.

I Arthur’s appeal for the exten-
sion was supported by many bio-
logy undergraduates who felt that
the initial unfavorable decision
disregarded Arthur’s te'aching
ability and dedication to students.
Petitions were circulated through-

' V out the department in a campaign

r»

organized by Judy Meteney. a lab
tdchnician at Scaife Hall and a
former student of Dr. Arthur.

Arthur has vowed to appeal to
Dean Rosenberg if the depart-
ment fails to grant an extension.
Final tenure decisions are made
by the Provost on the basis of a
recommendation from the FAS
Dean.

This year the Dean and the Pro-
vost disregarded several tenure
recommendations and_ did not

who’ had been recommended by
their respective departments. In
most instances, however, depart-
mental recommendations are not
over ruled. '

Dr. Arthurihas beenteaching at
Pitt for five years. As head of the
biology undergraduate advising
center, she has met nearly all bio-
logymajors.

“I think I'm doing a job_in ad-
vising that no one else will do if I
leave,” she said. “I always felt
that it was my duty to give reli-
able. personalized advice to all of
the students, and I am convinced
that the only way to give this ad-

' vice is to know the students as hu-

manbeings.

“You can’t just say, ‘Number
59l7—you do this, Number 5918-
do that,’ without knowing the stu-

dent well,” she added; Advising.

must be geared to the potential,
ambition, and personality of each
individual advisee, according to
Arthur.

She believes that the depart-
ment did not consider her teach-
ing and advising abilities on a
par with research in making their
initial tenure recommendation to
the Dean. She remarked that the
Provost’s outline on, tenure poli-
cies states: that a candidate does
not need to prove excellence in all
areas of qualification (teaching.
research», other University re-
lated duties and community serv-
ice). .

Arthur was debilitated by a
stroke three years‘ ago and still
walks with a cane. "I don't know
whether people realized just how

sick I was. I tried to keep it a
secret because I didn't want to
upset the students.” she said.

“I realized that I only had so
much energy and I decided I
should spend it on ,my teaching
and advising duties,” Arthur add-
ed. “Only during the last year
have I been well enough to do re-
search, but it seems to be going
very well.” ~

Arthur has published two papers
in journals during her stay at Pitt.
Her ,research in neurophysiology
concerns chemical interactions in
excitablemembranes.

“I should be able to publish sev-
eral papers next year. ‘if I am al-
lowed to continue my research,"
Arthur commented. "I really need
a year’s extension to prove my re-
search capabilities to the depart-
ment. .

A similar campaign to gain ten-
ure for an instructor was insti-
tuted several weeks ago by nurs-
ing students on behalf of Dr. Toby
Chapman, an organic chemistry
professor who was not recom-
mented for tdnure by the chemis-
try department. Signed petitions
were presented to the Dean, but
the final decision has not yet been
released. , ,

The question of student input
into tenure decisions has become
a major issue in many depart-
ments this year. Many students
maintain that the departments do
not evaluate and consider the
teaching abilities of assistant pro-
fessors adequately when making
tenure recommendations and that

they ovéremphasize the research

roles of the candidates. '

Swami Addresses Vendanta Society,  

Links East, West Philosophies

by DEBBIE POPP

In this day of comparative reli- .

gions. it is important to bridge
the gap between east and west.
This was the opening statement
of the visiting Rev. SwamiNitya-
bodhanada. head of the Rama-
krishna Center. Geneva, Switz..
as he addressed an open Vedanta
meeting held at David Lawrence
Hall Wednesday evening.

One possible link in that con-

I struction is to compare the west-

ern concept of the mindvas under-
stood by Freud and Carl Jung to
Venanta which is concerned with
the study of man enshrined in him-
self and as the inherent divinity of
all beings.

Freud and Jung were concerned
with harmony within the human
mind. They experimented with the
curative aspects of psychiatry and
probed the role of the human mind
in search of a meaningful life.

In their view. man is inclined to
escape the responsibility of life.
This repression surfaces as neu-

Through ps_vchoanalysis.

"We do" not cure the patient."

‘stated Freud. “The patient cures
himself. We put the patient in

front of his problems. Itis the self

  
 

   

   

~

 to-the'Swani

curative power that every patient
possesses."

“This reference to a self cura-
tive power correlates to the inher-
-ent power of Vedanta that comes
to the surface when weface an-
guish or conflict,” asserted the
Swami, the author of Sense of the
Sacred. .

V Before the Supreme Being sends
a problem. he sends the power to
bear it. An ideal life is a life with
problems and with the capacity of
solving those problems. according]

   

   
 

   

The psychoanalyst and the guru
can be compared in the sharing
and the bearing of the problem.

Vendanta proposes that man
can conjure the power from with-

-in himself to succumb all prob-

lems. Let him get depressed and
he is his own enemy. He is his own
friend when elevated.

Self intention can dominate or
block the obsession of weakness.
jealousv. and fear. according to
the Swami. If, we project the op-
posite idea and continue to sup-
port it we can come to an end, he
added.

This theory of the Paradox of
Intent is used in psychology today.
Jung restored the mental equili-
brium of a younger mother by ‘con-
fronting her with the responsibil-
ity of causing the accidental death
of her daughter. When the mother
finally mustered the strength
from within to assume that re-
sponsibility she was cured.

Vedanta conflicts with Freud
and again corresponds more to
Jung‘s concept of the libido in con-.
tending that basic human energy
has no sexual character. The hu-
man being has a certain amount
of energy and should be utilized

for creative powers. Rhysical en- .

joyment is —not‘essential

Cluttham tudentsBlame 
Ills 0n.President  

‘by JIM HOSEK

"We’ve been using the proper channels all year. and it has gotten
us nowhere,” said Jeanie Swantko, a senior at Chatham College, in ref-

erence to the resolvement of campus problems with the administration. ’

Chatham’s president, Dr. Edward D. Eddy, in particular, was ac-
cused of being the “root of the whole problem." ’ ‘ '

In an open letter signed by‘53 Chatham students, Dr. Eddy was ac-
cused of being “negligent in carrying out policies of the institution.”

“It’s about time," said.Swantko,

“that the dealings on Chatham
campus are made public. ' "

"Many students have spent a lot of time and effort struggling to u ‘

effect some sorely needed changes at Chatham. We are‘ not about to
give up, and if it is necessary to remove Dr. Eddy as president, we will
continue to do so." ' -

One of the criticisms of the Eddy administration, as brought. out \

in the open letter published last week, was the failure of the‘ college to
hire a black‘ admissions and financial aid counselor. The College had
agreed to hire a counselor in 1969‘upon. consultation with the Black Stu-
dent Union (BSU). - i ‘

The BSU, in a prepared statement, said, "We have no recourse ex- ‘ _ V ,
cept that of focusing the public eye upon thd deceptive and ethnocentric » ‘ ‘ 1

attitudes of this ‘liberal‘ institution."

Another cirticism dealt with the hiring and firing of campus se-' . v 

curity officers. Acommittee was formed last year “to define the quali-

fications and duties of the security chief and the security force"; after :

.four months of work, the committee set up its guidelines.

. “Dr. Eddy,” however, according to the letter, “ignored the com-
mittee’s proposals deliberately.”

The case of Dr. ,Nan Pendrell, who was chairman of the Sociology,‘
Anthropology Department, is another "sore spot” with the students
concerning the Eddy administration.

/Dr. Pendrell. currently 66 years old, is suing Chatman College for
lack of due process with regard to her forced retirement. ‘

Hired under “rare and unusual circumstances (two years beforezgi ,
the normal retirement age of 65),” and appointed chairman of the So.-* f “
ciology/Anthropology Department at the agent 64, Dr. Pendrell was _:

fired at the age of 66. s

. “Since Dr. Pendrell-arrived at Chatham,” according to the letter, . 
“she has introduced six‘new courses and has fought consistently for the ./ «

rights of students.” V
Dr. Eddy claims that “rare and unusual circumstances” no longer,
apply, and Dr. Pendrell was notified of her dismissal.

Also under criticism by the students is the over-all hiring and firing
policies of faculty and depar ment chairmen. ' ' '

- The 19 page critical letter also mentioned other examples of “ne-’ .1

glect‘-’ on the part of the Eddy administration, but this was‘denied in a
statement issued by Dr. Eddy. - 4

"Their discussion," he said,

» “T_he president of‘ the college or university is expected to make de- 

cisions,including potentially unpopular ones. . . . I_am always aware of

“is filled with glaringly inaccurate _

t- ‘:1.

   
  
   
  
   
    
  
 
  
 
     
    
  
   
  
   
  
    
   
   
   

criticism, of course, but -I am also responsible to all of the students, ‘'

the faculty and the trustees.”

Dr. Eddy, however, was not available for further comment for the
Pitt News. I -

"From Dr. Eddy's statement." said Miss Swantko, “he does not‘
indicate where the inaccuracies lie or bother to state why thd informa-
tion is incomplete.”

"Although this issue has just been brought to the public eye,” she -

added. “this struggle against the Eddy administration has been going
on atChatham for years.” . \ ‘

Song, Dance Highlight Festival

by LOIS LIEBERMAN

Folk singing and dancing high-
lighted the 16th year of-the Pitts-
burgh International Folk Festi-
val last weekend. Nationality
groups throughout the city prac-
tice ethnic dances and musical se-
lections throughout the year to
present a program representative
of their cultural background at the
Civic Arena.

Since the festival’s inception
there has been a noticeable ad-
vancement in the sophistication
of the performances. Even the
opening musical selection by the
orchestra showed an advance-
ment in coordinating the show.

The sele_ction'inc1uded typical
music representing each nation-
ality group and giving the pro-
gram a universal flavor, This
year more men performed in mu-
sical numbers and sometimes
were the feature performers. as
in Italy, Russia. Lebanon, Greece
and England.

The majority of the groups on
Saturday (par_ticulary the Indians.
Egyptians and English) present-
ed stunning dance routines. The
musical selection of the English
group was representative of Eli-
zabeth I’s era, gaily‘ dressed court
jestors and satin-attired nob_els
costumed in knickers of pink,

blue or black danced the minuet

with English ladies,

As a dancer-showman, a fellow
in pink was exceptional. Toward
the end of the act he leaped from"

the stage and danced through the
aisles of the Civic Arena, spot-
lights followed him, as he circled
the first tier.

‘ The festival this year welcom-
ed-as newcomers the Egyptian
group. Their dances and musical
entertainment resembled those
exhibited by other mid-eastdrn
nationalities like Lebanon and Is-
rael. Their costumes were repre-
sentative of the Moroccans
who left and settled in Spain cen-
turies ago.

Pyramids in the distance and a
sphinx were the backdrop of the
middle. eastern. group. A belly
dancer performed the finale of
the act.

A stick-slapping dance was per-
formed by the Indians, long poles
twicethe length of broomhandles
were used as weapons in fight-
ing. The battle-dance represent-
ed a fight between suitors for the
affections of a young lady. At the
conclusion, neither man won be-
cause the woman ran off with an-
other young man.

On Staturday evening the festi-
val performers put on a second

show with many of the groups ap— .

pealing to the public through
children. Four to eight year old
youngsters from the Philippines
performed a traditional dance as

did Israel children.

The Philippinesalso used chil-
dren to display their traditional
stick dance. Two girls were obvi-
ously adept at jumping-between
and over the poles. being slap-
ped together»by other partici-
pants.

Lebanese youngsters displayed
hand movements
and rhythmic footsteps tradi-
tional to their heritage. ’

Italy performed a Tarantella as

performances of talented people,

Although the performers were

  Mitchell Receives Chancellor’s Medal

The woman responsible for mak-
ing the University’s Cathedral of
Learning “the best known school
house in the world,” Ruth Craw-
ford Mitchell, received the Chan-
cellor’s Medal from Pitt Chancel-
lor Wesley W. Posvar at a special
ceremony Wednesday, May 24
in the Chancellors office.

Mitchell, who celebrated her
83rd birthday this month, is being
honored for her contributions to
the “internationalizing” of Pitt

3

and for her continuing efforts in

local and international affairs.

Joining the University in 1924
as a lecturer on the history of
immigration, Mitchell gave ilp
teaching two years later to be-
come a special assistant to the
then-Chancellor John G. Bowman,
advising him on aspects of build-
ing the Cathedral of Learning and
the initiation of the Nationality
Rooms.

The rooms, which serve as class-
rooms, reflect through their ar-
chitecture and decor and the cul-
tures and traditions of 16 individ-
ual countries. In undertaking the
task — from organizing commit-
tees to raising funds and con-
sulting with al:chitects—Mitch-
ell visited the majority of coun-
tries represented and established
contacts with monarchs, presi-
dents, educational leaders. ar-
tists, and architects. The visit
culminated in the formal recog-
nition of the University by every
nation represented by theNati_on-
ality Rooms.

During World War II, Mitchell
was granted a leave from Pitt
and served with the United Na-
tions Relief and Rehabilitation
Agency in Cairo. Returning to
Pitt in‘1946, she was inspired
by the need for international un-
derstanding and initiated the first

university-wide Committee on Ed-
ucational Exchange._ The pro-
gram, an outgrowth of the Na-
tionality Rooms program, pro-
vided endowment funds for stu-
dents and faculty to study and
travel abroad. Mitchell served as
executive secretary of the pro-
gram from 1949 to 1957.

Through her efforts, the first
Asian studies and Slavic studies
professors were brought to Pitt,
and modern Greek and Arabic
were introduced into the School
of General Studies curriculum,
with the support of the National-
ity Rooms Committee. She was
the only woman to serve as an as-
sociate director of the Army Spe-
cialized Training Program at Pitt,

and, in this capacity, coordinated

an intensive language training
program for cadets in Greek Rus-
sian, Serbo-Croatian, French, and
German.

Another of her contributions
was in expanding the comparative
literature program by organizing
a series of lectures by 16 out-
standing scholars from the coun-
tries represented by the Nation-
ality Rooms.

In 1957, Mitchell officially re-
tired and was named director em-
eritus of the Nationality Rooms.
Today, she continues as a consul-
tant to this program as well as to
the General Studies program.

Mitchell, who has been honored
by five governments, is the only
woman to have received the Da-
vid Glick award for service in the
field of internativnal relations
from the World Affairs Council
of Pittsburgh. In 1966, she was
awarded _an Honorary Doctorate
of Humanities from Pitt, and she
is a Distinguished Daughter of
Pittsburgh.

A 1912 graduate of Vassar,

she received an M.A. in 1915 from A

Washington University. She is ac-
tive in several international and
local organizations, and is cur-
rently undertaking a project to re-
store the tomb of Elena Piscopia
in Padua, Italy (Piscopia was the
first woman to receive a doctor-
ate).

A published author, Mitchell is
now editing a collection of letters
by Dr. Alice Garrigue Masaryk,
the elder daughter of Thomas G.
Masaryk, president-liberator of
the Czechoslavak Republic.

Keep PIRG
Off Invoice

The Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees re- -
_ cently determined that the University could not participate in

the collection of fees for an outside organization by mailing an
enclosure in the student invoice packet or by an entry on the
student invoice. \

This decision has effectively blocked the funding mechan-
ism sought by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG).

The Pitt News has opposed the ‘method suggested by PIRG
for funding.

The original PIRG proposal asked that a fee be assessed
students on the academic invoice. If a\ student found he did not
wish to support PIRG he could retrieve his money within the
first three weeksof the term. _ '

According to the proposal, “Since Western Pennsylvania
PIRG will be providing a public good, a ‘tax’ system is an ap-
propriate way to finance it. . 

' The Pitt News questions PIRG‘s right to determine what is
a public good, especially in this case.

We also opposed PIRG’s method of funding. By collecting
the fee on the student invoice, a student will not be able to reg-
ister without paying for PIRG.

The PIRG proposal states that the student can retrieve this
fee within the first three weeks of the term.

During these three weeks students are bogged down with
buying books, add-drop, late registration, correcting mistakes
on incoices and getting settled in housing.

Many will not bother to retrieve the money even if they
disagree with PIRG. Many students will not even know or care
what PIRG is and will not bother to ask for a refund. ’

Students, therefore will have to pay for PIRG whether

“ they want to or not and then the odds will be against their ask-

". ing for their money back. Fifty-one per cent of the student

' /

C  THIS PUBLICATION is edited and published by the students of the Univer- .
-__sity of Pittsburgh; it must not be construed as an official organ of the

 

body must ask for their money back before PIRG will dissolve
itself. '

The Pitt News feels that the Board of Trustees ‘made a wise
decision in refusing to grant PIRG this funding mechanism.

Letters to the Editor

Tum Mails Black

Dear Editor,

As effective as anti-war march-
es have been, the energy they
have generated has proved diffi-
cult to "sustain. The killings drags
on . .

A group of students at UC San-
ta Cruz has been searching for an
eloquent personal and ongoing ex-
pression of our discontent. We
were very impressed, therefore,
when we read of a peace action
conceived and developed" at the
University of Idaho. We have be-
gun to imitate its authors and urge
that some of you do likewise.

It’s a very simple plan. Turn
the mails black. First, you gather
a group of similarly frustrated
friends and begin delegating re-
sponsibilities. Then, find a print

shop and design black envelopes.’

They should meet the following
specifications—a white blank box
in the middle for the address and
a blank space in the corner for the
stamp and its cancellation mark.
(All of the cancellations must be
legible according to post office
regulations. )
In one corner include a few
words such as “In memory of
’ someone who died this morning in
Vietnam.” Print up several thou-
sand copies-—it should not cost
more than a couple of cents an
envelope. ,

Gather the envelpes into pack-

ets of-, say. 25 to be sold for $1.
and donate the profits to a worth-
while charity; we have chosen

(they collect and distribute fresh-

blood for the wounded in Indochi-
na), but there are others. Sell the
envelopes door to door, in shop-
ping centers, at parties, where-
ever. »

The key to the scheme, how-
ever, lies in a note which is in-
cluded in each packet, urging the
buyers to use only black envel-
opes in all of their correspondence
until the killing stops.

Give an address where they can
get more envelopes. Also urge

that they pass on the idea to resi-

dents in other communities. This
could become a chain letter for
peace, and within a month, per-
haps, the federal mails. will be
streaked with mourning black as
a silent witness t_o our distress
and outrage.

Perhaps we will get media cov-
erage in time. That doen’t seem
to be the important thing though.
What is important is that this ac-
tion is at once personal (me to you
—think of how many hands a let-
ter touches through its journey.

PIRG’s Reaction
To Trustees’ Policy,

The Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh met in an executive session on Friday, May 19, to

discuss Western Pennsylvania PIRG.

1

Immediately following the meeting, representatives of Western
Pennsylvania PIRG -were informed by telephond that the SAC consi-
dered that the University of Pittsburgh could not participate in col-
lection of a PIRG fee through use of the student invoice.

, Legal advice, judiciary responsibility,financial liability and tech-

nical difficulties were given as reasons by the University for not parti- ‘

cipating in PIRG.

The organizing committee of Western Pennsylvania PIRG does not
consider the above to be sufficient reasons for summarily rejecting
the petition of over 56 per cent of the student body.

Students representing Western Pennsylvania PIRG have been ne-
gotiating withthe University since mid-January and have repeatddly
asked for particular objections to the PIRG proposal.

' Western Pennsylvania PIRG has formally requested the SAC to
enumerate the objections alluded to in their statement.

The PIRG organizing committee hopes to have a list of detailed

_ objections within a week.
Negotiations are continuing with the University and it is hoped the -

University of Pittsburgh can join with those colleges and universities
now forming Western Pennsylvania PIRG.

Trustees’ PIRG Position

The Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh has evaluated various proposals for -assisting
Western Pennsylvania PIRG in the collection of fees.

They determined, based upon legal advice and their owninterpre-

tation of fiduciary responsibility, that the University could not parti-
cipate directly in the collection of fees for an outside organization by
mailing an enclosure in the student invoice or entry on the student in-
voice. The committee recognized the clear possibility of exposing he
University to financial liability if this were done.

The‘ WP/PIRG request was led to the adoption of a policy which
permits the University to offer the use of its mailing services, with
WP/PIRG stationery, on a reimbursable basis. This offer is based on
a petition of more than 30 per cent of the students endorsing the aims

and objectives of WP/PIRG.

In addition, the new policy will permit WP/PIRG, and any other
qualifying interested groups to solicit funds at designated areas on
campus;

It was also pointed out that any student group that organizes itself
within the framework of student activities of the University has had and
will continue to have the opportunity to apply to Student Government
for allocation of a portion of the studentactivities fee.

_ Individuals in the University administration stress that their dif-
ficulties in this area have been technical and not philosophical and that

they strongly support the worthy social objectives of consumer-inter
est research. . ‘

self).

If this makes sense to you, ac-
tivate yourself and your friends
today. Or at least pass the word to
someone who will. Think especial-
ly of friends in small towns
throughout America and pass the
word to them.

If you want more information,
you cah call Thad Curtz at 408-
423-1423 ‘or Robert Kearny in
Idaho (one of the guys who dream-
ed this thing up in the first place)

Let us pray that soon the mails
will run white again.

Dear Tom:

I have seen your letter of May

May I commend you. the Student

dents of this University for hav-
ing chosen this method to voice
your concerns over this vital is-
sue.

While all of us as Americans
will never agree fully about the
propriety ‘of our country’s poli-
cies, I hope we all do agree that it
is the better course for those who
wish to voice their opposition to
them to do so within the frame-

Misquote

Dear Sir:

I have just received a copy of
the Pitt News of May.2 Carrying
two stories by Jamie Kirkwood
on my Commencement Address
at Pitt and the news conference
that preceeded it.

I was taken aback to read a

final “quotation” in the article .

on my speech, the impact of
which is the exact 180 degree
opposite of my concluding point.
What I actually said, describing

one response to the frustrations-

felt by many people when they
discover that “there are no easy

‘answers to hard questions, some

respond with the anti—intellectu—
alism of the ‘new romanticism,’
which -says essentially that ‘the
head hasn‘t worked very well so

, let’s forget aboutiit and try the

heart.-’ My own plea is that it

will take more and better think- ‘

ing, not less, to resolve these
problems in ways which most
benefit the human race.”

I realize the difficulties in-
volved in taking notes on a
speech in a large, crowded audi-
torium.Nonet'neless, when a re-
porter has doubts about what is
said (as yours must have had in
this instance), I would think it
would make sense to check with
the speaker before printing some-
thing which makes no sense at
all. ‘ ’

summary of my remarks. you
and your readers might look at
the article in- the University

Back With New Sound

Association "Comes On’ Strong

by BARBARA GERAUD
Remember "Cherish.” "Never"
My Love" . . . “W-indy” . . .? Yes.

folks. the Association, the group
whose music was responsible for
so many of us falling in love way
back there in ’66 and ’67, is back
again, on a new label (Columbia),
with a new album, Waterbeds in
Trinidad, and a new sound.

Never fear, though, they aren’t
that new. The harmonies are still
seven years, but
they’re more polished, more sub-
tle. The group proves once again
that they can take ordinary songs

that anybody could do and arrange -

them into something exclusively
theirs. In a few instances, these
harmonies and arangements
tend to dominate the melody, but
these drawbacks are minor.

The tunes do fall sweetly on
the ears. The album’s highlight is
their current single. "Darlin’
Be Home Soon." Jim Yester’s
lends an ethereal quality to this
John Sebastian tune that the
Spoonful’s original version flack
ed.

He puts more of an emotional
emphasis on the poignant lyrics,
“I couldn't bear to wait an extra
minute if you dawdled . . 
Starting with a simple acoustic
guitar duet and building to the
full seven voices and instruments.
it is a moving song.

truck. A simple tale simply told,
but the production work accurate-
ly conveys the feeling of riding
down “a back road goin’ home.”

"Come the Fall,” by Terry
Kirkman. is probably the most
easily accessible of the songs; an-
other one of his “confession"
tunes (in the vein of "Look at Me.
Look at You,” and incorporating
some of the same harmonies).
This one dwells on the essential
loneliness of us all: "when you’ve
played the game‘ through the
only one you’ve got is you. the
end of a series of one.” Yes.

Lead guitarist Jules Alexander
has written four of the 10 songs
on the album, three of them with
Steve-Carey, a newcomer to the
ranks of those few who have co-
authored songs with members of
the group. *

The Association ‘usually re-_

cord all of their own material, but
this time they have gone to other
writers for four songs. Among
them is an old Carole King-Gerry
Goffin tune, “Snow Queen.”
Is one of her songs, a prere-
quisite for every album that
comes out? They do it well.

Jules" songs are all good. but
tend to .be just a bit obscure. They
have the essentials, and on first
listening come across on the one
level, but they leave this listener
with the disquieting feeling that
she’s missing something.

His “Kicking the Gong Around"
is my personal favorite on the al-
bum It starts out sounding like
(horrors!) Grand Funk’s "Foot-

much better song. There’s a good
heavy sax line woven through
most of the tune.

“Please Don't Go (Round the

“go native”—to Trinidad. Makes
one wonder if Columbia is going
to try that on _all their artists’ al-

yracuse, and West Virginia) met here and reaffirmed the basic
oncept of their ten year old agreement.

‘Prior to "the meeting, speculation. by the press. was high
hat the agreement was in grave danger and that Pitt‘ would fin-

ports, particularly football. “ .
‘ Seemingly, the agreement remained intact.

 Pitt Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski thinks the
hanges have yet'to be realized by -the public. According to
slinski there are three changes.

..Meetings by the faculty and the school presidents, which
, re completely overlooked for ten years, will become a regu-
Jar happening. The faculty representatives will meet later ‘this
 mmer to further work on the agreement keeping in mind the
delihes outlined in the May 4 meeting. The presidents are al-
eady scheduled to meet again in the fall. T
4 Under the Big Four agreement, 100 grants are permitted in
_tba1l and 20 in basketball over a -four year period. They re—-
’ ain the same with two veryimportant additions. ‘ ‘T
« First,. an academic redshirt, which did not exist prior, may
,n w be issued. That means that is an athlete fails in his school

rk, he can be redshirted. Eachlschool will be allowed ten aca-

A‘ ‘Second, the four schools will attempt to work out a common
cademic acceptance criteria. Pitt, Penn State, and Syracuse
IT use the NCAA 1.6 prediction requirement foreligibility for
,_athletic scholarship. West Virginia has its own devised
etho_d of obtaining this requirement, non-congruent- with the
ther three. * . ‘ .- '

, (With the redshirting of John Moss (Pitt) and Bernie Galiffa
W_VU) this srping the Big Four seemed to show signs of decay.
e two athletes receivdd retroactive redshirts—dating back
their problem filled sophomore years. Moss was handicap-
ed from bad reaction to medication as well as transferring
rom the School of Engineering Galiffa ‘had back problems.
oss received what is now called an academic redshirt—which
eans that as long as a player is going to be in school, he may
nplete his fourth year of-eligibility. due to him anyway.

~<;-Instead_ of decay, then, these redshirts show the strength
fthe revised agreement. '

‘}Recently, the Big,Ten faculty representatives voted to
allow redshirting—in an almost opposite move, which would
' eem to question the Big Four decision. According to Myslin-
.s 1. however, the athletic departments of these schools re-
‘ ain opposed to the tactic and should not let it slip through as
w.

 

The Big Four would have had a better chance of being dis-
tinued had not the NCAA passed a new rule allowing
reshmen to compete in varsity sports. This ruling now gives

aches enlarged rosters to sift through. Indirectly, this al-

dditional scholarships.

_  Aside from giving Big Four coaches more flexibility with
*the roster, the freshman rule might serve as a deterrant for
cholarship crazy colleges around the country, as well as possi-

fbly reducing redshirting. .

it ,Without the freshman rule, the new Big Four agreement
wouldn’t have been acceptable to those who believe in additional
cholarsh1ps' and redshirting. With the newly inagurated

In a meet like this.”

With over 65 schools sending
over 1,333 participants, including
a lot of top small college entries,
it isn’t hard to understand why.

“lt’s hard to figure out where
the coaches will use their person-

nel. A coach might have a top mil- _

er but might decide to use him in
the half mile. The commitments
have to be in by Thursday and they
(IC4A officials) are very strict
about any changes,” said Banner.

In his placement of the runners,
Banner has decided to go for the
first places instead-of seconds and
thirds, mainly because he lacks

. the depth required to do so. But,

if everything falls in place, as it
has failed to do so for him in the
past, the tracksters might find

themselves the dark’ horse in the

running. A

In ’last year’s outdoor version,
Villanova copped first place
with 32 points.‘ With only seven
points separating the ‘next ‘four
teams .(P.itt finished fifth with 25
points), things got hairy near the
end.‘

“In making an educated guess,”
Banner continued, “I would say
that the winner would need ahy-
where from 30 to 40 points. That’s
just a guess.”

In the meet, Pitt will have one
good thing going for it. In four of
the events, the Pittsburghers will
have the best time (in the outdoor
season) -of any of its competitors.

ented trio.

. Those players leaving the Panther team are
first baseman Ken Macha, second baseman Bob
Livingston, and pitcher Mike Niccols. .

With the departure of Macha, the mitters lose
a powerful hitter as,well‘as a good defensive man.

For the past two years he has been the back-
bone of the Panther lineup. In his junior year Macha
pounded out a .415 batting average and tallied sev-
en home_runs and 31 RBI’s; this season he batted
an‘ even .300, collecting five HR’s and 15 RBI’s.

"There's a very good chance that ‘Ken will be
drafted by a pro team,” related Pitt coach Bob Le-
wis. “Several teams have been looking at him-
right now itall depends on who drafts him and how

high."

In LivingstorI’s absence at second. the mitters lose
one of the finest fielding second basemen the Uni-

versity has ever seen.

In his last two seasons’as a Panther, Livingston
- was given the honor of being selected to play in the
coaches’ Tri-State All-Star baseball game.

Although not especially strong with the bat
‘(for the last two seasons he hit _.268 and'.236, re-

son, Rick Weaver, and Chuck Ma-
zingo, 3:12) and Bill Rea (26’7‘/2”

‘in the long jump and-'50’l0” in the

triple" jump) can all make that
claim. A winner will receive six
points for a first place, four for a
second, three for a third,.two for a
fourth, and one for a fifth. Assum-
ing Pitt won these four firsts, it
would total 24 points.‘

And assuming again that the re-.
maining tracksters could muster
some placing points between them,
victory is in the real of possibil-
ity. ' . .
For Penn, victory is more feasi-
ble. Coming off the indoor cham-
pionship, the Quakers will have
Bruce Collins in the 120 - hur-
dles (1/3.6), Tom Blair, a 17 foot
pole vaulter, Dennis Fikes _in the

‘steeplechase, Karl Thornton ‘for

distance, and Julio Piazza in the
mile or three mile. '

“Jumbo” Elliot will have his_
usual assortment of imported tal-

ent going for Villanova. Mackel- '0

roy, Gregran, Savage are familiar
Wildcat names that will be there.

“Penn is a very well balanced,” I

continued Banner. “They are in -

good position to take the thirds,

man. “I think our biggest prob-
