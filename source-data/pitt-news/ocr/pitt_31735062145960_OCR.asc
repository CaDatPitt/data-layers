 if the _ students would get be-

Tlbally-, that without a dou'bt,-5 the per-

- The editorial staff of’ the “Vadee
Mecum” will be appointed within the
next few weeks. The appointments
will be determined by apopular sug=
gestion contest.‘ Any co-ed ‘ student
may suggest the names of those girls-

whom she thinks capable 'of_editing_'

the"‘Vade Mecum-’;. A ballot box has
ﬂoor of Alumni Hall. The sugges-
tions are-to b% deposited in this box».

The “Vade Mecum” is the handbook
of information for the Freshman girl.
The ﬁrst book was "published Alast‘.-year"
and was a success from the s'ta'nd--
point "of help to the Frosh co-eds. The
result is that W. S. G. A, has decided
to put out a better and larger “-Vade
Mecum” for the next school year. Co-
edsshould not miss this opportunity
to help select a capable staff.’ 7 
‘ The requirements for the editorial

o‘1erance,_» truthfulness,
justness, self-respect, self-control,‘ and
‘good physical condition were declared
essential to good citizenship by Lt.
Walter L. McCormick of the Military
Department speaking Tuesday even-
ing, January 22, before’ the Student
Forum at the Y, M. C. A. but. These
qualities, according to Lieutenant‘MMc-
Cormick, are necessary to the per-
formance of the two prime duties of ‘a
citizen, »to defend the rights. of his
community and to keep or make that
community worthy of defense; M

.“An absolute index to a man's char-
acter is the.,way he talks of his own
home town,” said the speaker in Mdis-
cussing patriotism. .The spirit of al-
legiance to the place of birth. he
claimed, is part of the nature of hu-
man beings and involves not only the
‘obligation to 'ﬁg_ht for the homeland in
time of war-Mbut to voteand cause’
good laws to he passed so that the
nation willbe in the right. In this
connection the speaker remarked that
an important quality for young people
to cultivate is tolerancerof the..-opin-
ions of other people, and that there is
something radically wrong with any
person [Who cannot like ninety per
cent. ofthe ,-people he meets.’ M

The habit of‘ exaggeration ,was at-
;tackMed as an enemy to-MtruthMVand~ char-
acter. In speaking of ‘justness Lieu-
tenant Mccormack criticised the pres-
ent tendency of jurymén andlawyers

“ i-..sI..'......‘ e

   

the diﬂicult parts have been . ably»
-ﬂlled by Eliza Jane Reynolds ’26,Mand
Betty. Stevenson '24.
M The play is aMstudy of .the charac-
ters of a mother anda daughter. The
mother misunderstands, doesn't want
to understand, her daughter, and
‘places her -Puritahistic moral sta;g;d-
ards between the girl and happiness.
The verbal and mental struggle ‘- be-
tween them is worthy of high rank
among the best scenes in modern
drama. The two minor parts‘ of the
sister and brother are. ﬁlled by Anna
Bess Matthews, and by David Weiss.
The other two plays-on the pro-
gram, “MatinaMta’-’ and “Moonshine,”
are of a lighter; nature than “The Con-
flict,” but are both ‘well constructed
and possess greaMtM~eute,rtaining quali-
ties. “Matinata” is a fantasy of buoy-
ant humor. Columbine. almost‘ leaves
her devoted husband, Pierrot, to elope
with Harlequin; .,but what. - woman
would elopeMwithMa man so prosaic as
‘to insist onhaving his umbrella and
his overshoes with him__?. Francis A.
-‘Riley takes thepart of Pierrot; Mar-M
garet Probst, Columbine; and J.
Charles Reed, Harlequin, M ' »

by all citizens regardless of their opin-
ions, and if the laws are to "be changed
-it should be by constitutional meth-

-administration. ' _. « _ .
“A manwithout honor can never be
happy,” claimed the speaker .-in nienl
tioning the‘ preservation of ..Mself-‘Mre-
spect. . Hedrew a great dMiMs.tinct_ion_be-,
tween self-respect ‘and conceit, how-
ever. ~Self-control, particularly f, re-

was declared an essential quality. of

Someone, probably an insuraitlce
agent, was _quoted recently es saying
that from the massof one" hundred
college graduates one individual only
rose to the Polo and butler class, peril.-
ously near the top of the ﬁnapcial lad-
der. Five others became - comfortably
olland found themselves after ‘twenty
years atthe small yacht and chauffeur
stage. The other ninety—four presum-
ably congregate in Mthe great section of

the American people who drive ‘their .
M own Buicks to the golf club. In other

words, dreaming about being a rich
man is oneMthin‘g, and making the grade
is ‘something else again.’ ’ _

 Yet the ninety-four presumably work
just as hard as the sumptuous six. Their

- business‘ is the axis on which a small

and uninteresting World revolves; They
have become devotees of the dollar
and when that ﬁckle deity deserts, have
nowhere else to turn. Jammed in a
dull, straight rut of business they can

ﬁnish, Wash-Jeff took only a trio of.‘
points under cover while Parsons and
Levinson snatched Ithelead, in the ter-
riﬁc" Pitt spurt for safety markers.
Carlin again came through for the
Red and Black by scoring . another
ﬁeld goal, making his total three and
successfully upholding his reputati_on.V

'A_ summary of thetilt ‘shows that
the Gold and" Blueallowed the Wash-
ington countians only four ﬁeld goals.
For W, & J. Carlin] was ‘undoubtedly
_the star while Parsons probablyleads
the Pitt ﬁeld. ILevinson’s ﬂoor work
wasat the height of its perfection and
Carr’s steady guarding held the un-
bounded interest of the largest ‘audi-
ence of the season. At the central
circle a furious V-battle continually
lashed itspelf between Horse Chase
and Niellaus, who consistently lost
the J'11mD- For the ﬁrst "time since
