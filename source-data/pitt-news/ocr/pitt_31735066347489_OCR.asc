BY RANDY GAYSEK

Three of Pitt’s professional
schools failed to rank among the top
ten professional schools in the
country, according to a recent
U.C.L.A. survey of leading law and

graduate business and education

schools.

The survey, “The Cartter Report .

on Leading Schools of Education,
Law and Business,” ranked Pitt’s
law school 50th out of 91, Pitt’s
Graduate School of Education 30th
out of 81 and Pitt’s Graduate School

‘of Business 28th out of 51.

Stanford’s graduate school of
business and education and Har-
vard’s law school topped the three
categories of professional schools
ranked by the survey.

Louis Solman, a’ U.C.LiA. faculty
member who coordinated the
survey and who heads the Higher
Education Research Institute at Los
Angeles, which published . the
survey, said the ranking system was
based on the opinions of 1600 deans
and faculty members across the

' country.

“We asked the deans of various
schools to have ﬁve or six of their
faculty to rate the schools,” Solman
-said. “Each educator received a list
of the leading professional schools
and then ranked each school on the
list according to his or her personal
experience with any of them, and
what they had heard about the
school’s reputations,” -he said.

Solman said more emphasis was

placed on faculty quality than on

educational attractiveness.

The survey has drawn criticism
from the three Pitt deans whose

school’s were ranked.

James Kelly Jr., dean of Pitt’s
School of Education was not upset
by his department’s relatively low

rating.

“I don't pay much attention to
surveys that are not based on

traditional criteria,” Kelly said.

“I tend to place a higher
importance on judging an institu-
tion on the basis of how well it
fulfills its own missions; that is, on
its records and the placement and
success of its graduates,” he said.

Kelly said student experiences,
such as easy access and rapport
with teachers, should be more
important then the size, reputation
or prestige of the school or its

faculty.

Edward Sell, dean of Pitt’s law
school, expressed similar feelings

about the‘ survey."

Oakland has the third highest
trafﬁc density of all business
districts in Pennsylvania, according
to Gary Erenrich, transportation
planner with the Pittsburgh De-
partment of City Planning.

Oakland’s health center complex
of hospitals, along with Pitt because
it is the largest employer in the city,
contributes to traffic density.

_ Erenrich said: “When the host of

Oakland’s cultural, social and
recreational facilities are taken into
account, the area is only second to
downtown.”

Downtown Philadelphia has the"

highest traffic density in the state,

f   Women Have Equal Opportunity in Education

.2'.v.\‘~'\il.‘\ce '.-_-'

I V Pennsylvania.

 

Editor’s Note: This article is the
second In a series dealing with the
Issues of women and the law.

BY BETSY NORMAN

Equal opportunity in education,
from the public elementary schools
to most of the private institutions of
higher education, is guaranteed,
regardless of sex, to everyone in
A variety of both

state and federal laws guaranteeing
this equal opportunity involve
subjects from admissions to ath-
letics. q

These laws, including the Penn-
sylvania Equal Rights Amendment,
the state Fair Educational Oppor-
tunities Act, the equal protection
clause of the United States
Constitution and most recently,
Title IX.of the federal Educational
Amendments Act, provide a legal
basis to ﬁght sex discrimination in
educational institutions at all levels.

Title IX, which went into effect in
1975, strictly prohibits any educa-
tional program or activity that
receives federal assistance, from
carrying out any discriminatory
practices on the basis of sex. Since
all public school systems, all
state-owned or state-related col-
leges and universities and most
private colleges and universities in

Pennsylvania receive federal
assistance, the majority of women
in Pennsylvania are protected
against discrimination.

The effect of Title IX and other

  

 

 
 

most significant in cases dealing
with access to courses, pregnancy
and athletics. Under these laws, no
course can restrict enrollment on
the basis of sex. Girls cannot be
required to take home economics,
nor can boys be required to take
shop. Likewise, no class such as
“cooking for boys,” or “shop for
girls” can be offered. Title IX
requires that all physical education
classes be sexually integrated by
the fall of 1978, except for classes in
contact sports such as football or
wrestling.

Title IX requires schools to look at
pregnancy as any other temporary
disability. Schools must leave it up
to the student and her doctor to
determine how long she can remain
in school and how soon after
childbirth she can return. While
some school districts offer special
programs with separate classes for
pregnant students, a student is not
required to enroll in such programs
if she prefers to remain with her
regular class.

In terms of higher education,
Title IX is more specific. According
to the ACLU’s “Women and the
Law” pamphlet: Sexually dis-
criminatory admissions policies are
prohibited in all public colleges and
all graduate,’ vocational and profes-
sional schools that receive any

Title IX also requires that access
to courses. programs, opportunities
and privileges must be equal for
both sexes. It also states .that all
school sponsored organizations,
with the exception of social
fraternities and sororities, must not
discriminate on the basis of sex in
admission or activities.

In dealing wiith housing, Title IX
requires housing of similar quality
and of proportionately equal
quantity be provided to members of
both sexes. Separate housing may
be provided, but services and costs
must be the’ same. Occupancy
regulations, including curfews and
visitation rules, must be identical
for both sexes.

The requirements for athletics in
higher education institutions are
detailed under Title IX. Brieﬂy, it
states schools must provide equal
athletic opportunities for students
of both sexes. The factors to be
used in determining equality are:

The Student Government Board (SGB) candidates hailed increased
‘student services as a panacea for the eﬂects of a tuition hike. These ser-.
vices could help ease the budgetary crunch brought on by an increase in
the bottomyﬁgure of a student's academic invoice, they claimed.
Unfortunately, no candidate speciﬁed exactly what increased student
services meant. One could not tell if they proposed expansion of present
services or addition of new ones to those now in effect. There are
u services, however that require anything from a little more effort to a lot
-of revamping to make them moge responsive to student needs.
For instance, the food co-op. A gem of the Weisband administration,
‘it almost dissolved because of too much food and not enough
A cooperative work. Too many people were willing to let too few do all the
work. And when these few became overworked and were ready to quit,
they almost took the co-op with them.
~ To boost the co-op, a few Board members should actively participate
in it. They can then get ﬁrst-hand information on how the co-op is
operating and exactly what it needs. The Board can then judge from this
data exactly what changes are needed.
Z The Undergraduate Academic Review (UAR) can provide students
with feedback on which courses and which professors are academically
ideal. Unfortunately, the review is still hung up in the University Senate

Educational Policies committee.

V The painstakingly meticulous efforts of the previous administration to
create a UAR that is more powerful than its paper-tiger predecessor
must not have occurred’ in vain. The new SGB, through the
undergraduates on the Educational Policies Committee, must work to
get the proposal unsnarled and approved by the full Senate. They can
also start working now to be ready to prepare the UAR, once approved.
C The future of the Legal Awareness Committee and A Little Help From
Your Friends must be weighed. They currently handle a fraction of the
workload and membership carried in past years. Perhaps carefully
managed publicity would make these services more attractive to the
student. Or perhaps _a reassessment of their priorities. Useless

organizations should be eliminated.

The same holds for the Student Government Complaint Center
created by Chip Hubbard last year. The new Board must decide whether
or notto retain it in its present form since few students utilize it. Would
some publicity attract students to use it?

Student services, tuition hike, student input—these issues face the
newly elected SGB. They will be under the constant scrutiny of their

: President Carter sat next to a

crackling ﬁre in the White House
library, drew the television cameras
close and called for energy
conservation. The ﬁreside chat
motif was appealing, Mr. Carter
seemed more relaxed than usual
and, if my barometer of public
opinion is not incorrect, his
message was well-received.

Unfortunately, other than vague-
ly exhorting us to eliminate waste
and be thrifty, the president said
little about actual conservation
methods. Assuming that the
participatory responsibility of the
“average citizen” has not yet been
totally usurped by some specialized
heirarchy, perhaps a few sugges-
tions are in order.

In last Wednesday’s column I
lamented that present-day private
enterprise’s narrow view of respon-
sibility precludes our looking in that
direction for solutions to the energy

not attempt to water down the ugly

brutalities of a corrupt institution.
Oftentimes, -provocative topics
such as war or slavery, divide
America into opposing ca_mps.
Hence, it is not unnatural _that
Americans viewed “Roots” from a
number of_ varying vantagefpoints.
From a minority point of view, one is
left with a host of meanings:
knowledge about the past, insight
into the present, hopes for the
future and perhaps even raw
emotions. Yet, perhaps from the
majority point of view, reactions are
not as stirring. While many remain
sympathetic to the plight and
struggles of an oppressed group,

‘they may not e'xperience the same

impact, suffer the same rage or
derive the same implications as
black Americans. For it was not
their color which had been singled
out for servitude, nor their people
subjected to lynchings, beatings,
rapes and‘ a continuing list of
indignities. But by no means does
this imply that white people should
have missed such a presentation. in
the vein that it either does not apply
to them or is not their problem.

To view “Roots" as an issue.
meaningful to only Americans of
African descent, could not be
further from the intention of_ its

the following: “This is the story of

r tas-

puzzle. Sad to say, the so-called
consumer movement is not likely to
come up with any answers, either.

Just as with the corporations,
self-interest stands squarely be-
tween consumerism and conserva-
tion. While the gas companies
promise more fuel in exchange for
deregulation, the consumerists
demand more gas and the cheaper
the better. Either way, more now is
less later, no matter what the cost in
dollars. Conservation clearly has no
real place in this scenario, and as
long "as “maximum goods/ mini-
mum cost” remains the be all "and
end all of consumerist economics,
nothing will change.

Despite lack of leadership, the
situation is not hopeless.

Development of environmentally-
conscious and responsible norms
for consumption must be at the
heart of any conservation effort.
Acceptance of such norms would
enable us to reshape our lifestyles

  Unfolding History/s Abominable Chapter

The history of slavery pertains to
all Americans, yet it raises
questions that in the past have been
easier or safer to avoid. Prominent’
Negro novelist, James Baldwin
contends: “In _the context of the
Negro problem neither whites, nor

_ blacks, for excellent reasons of their

own, have the faintest desire to look
back; but I think that the past is all
that makes the present coherent,

and further, that the past "will "

remain horrible as long as we refuse
to assess it honestly.” (12 Prose
Writers, “Passage From Notes of a
Native Son.”) ' —.~
Baldw’in’.s words could not ‘be
more true. The present which all
Americans have come to know is but
an offspring of the past. . The two
must be connected historically,
before drawing conclusions about

the economic and social struggles, .

flaring through what has become
today's racially divided country.
The ghettos that appall us in the
North did not always exist; they
were created by an exodus of poor
Southern blacks who believed their
economic chances would be bette
there. Indecent, overcrowr'
housing which soon emerged was
hxeither the choice nor preference of
poor folks, but quite oppositely,
their lack of choice. The riots that-
tore before us in the late 1960's
were not precipitated for kicks;
they were a ﬁnal attempt, to_
terminate hellish frustrations of

urban existence. Nor can we claim

and economic policies in accordance
with energy realities.

‘ We can do more thanturn down,

the thermostat to conserve energy
in our homes. We can, for instance,
evaluate the environmental viability
of our electric toothbrushes, electric
blankets, electric can openers,
electric knives, etc. An honest
analysis should lead many Ameri-
cans, heavily laden, to the trash
bins.

To have any real effect,
conservation must extend beyond
the home. Industry must de-em-
phasize energy-intensive growth—.
if not voluntarily, then by law—and
replace ‘it with a labor-intensive
orientation. A move away from
highly mechanized mass production
will cut into proﬁts, butpin terms of
energy conservation, it is manda-
tory. Two corollary beneﬁts of
labor-intensive enterprise would be
a reversal of the dehumanization
process inherent in assembly line
work and areduction of industry’s
capacity—and therefore willing-
ness-—to make junk. .

The energy (and capital) saved by
eliminating frivolous and unnecess-
ary consumer goods could - be
redirected into areas of real need.
Energy expended in developing and
maintaining an efﬁcient system of
mass transportation would in turn
help save enormous amounts of fuel
in the future.

Sacriﬁce must be anintegral part
of energy conservation. For most

Americans, wearing a sweater and -

unplugging the "toothbrush will not
sufﬁce. We must submit to an
across-the-board lowering of our
over-consumptive standard of living
if ourefforts are to have any effect

The’ United States has been
‘blessed with unprecedented pros-
perity, but easy access tocapital
and resources gives no one license
to use them irresponsibly. In view
of environmental limitations, we

must remember that we indulge in .

our energy-intensive economics and
luxuries at the expense of less
affluent peoples’ needs.

’Roots’ Unfolds History/s AbominabIeChapter

( Continued from Page 4)
drug addiction to be the habits of
aimless drifters, but must see it as
the habits of people who have few, if
any, more fulﬁlling directions to

turn.
Some view issues likethese as

social problems to be attacked by
social scientists, while others sing

I . the blues of these realities in their

everyday lives.

It is easier for more fortunate
Americans to view the perplexities
of black ghetto life as the fault of
those who exist there. To attempt to

‘ find other reasons which might

explain such tragedies is just too
much to undertake. How tempting
to forget the conditions under which

' blacks became members of this

nation or the circumstances of their
early life here.
I Educators discuss new methods to

stimulate the “disadvantaged”
school child. Perhaps . black

v children aren’t learning at the
, capacity of which they are capable

because scientists like William
Schockley are busy spreading
theories of genetic inferiority in the
black intellect. Or because schools
are insisting on the use of King's
English and invalid testing. We
have overlooked what has been the
history of education for blacks in
this country: there was none for the
longest time. What Southern black
living in the ‘days of slavery could

I hope to learn to read? And who in
, the aftermath of Northern migration

had time or opportunity to master
adequate skills for college en-
trance? Branded as a social stigma,
without education or marketable
skills, who could ever hope to earn a
living equal to the standards of

other oeople? _
Sociologists should not discuss the

nature of the black man's self-con-
cept until their hands and feet have
been locked in chains, until they
have known the despair of family
separation and the humiliation of
whippings. Let us not forget either
the Constitution which helped to
castrate the black man even more,

by stating that he was to be counted
as three-ﬁfths ofa man in matters of
apportionment and taxation.
Instead of harping on failure and
defeat, they should do better to
reflect how they would regard
themselves if their grandparents
were once two ﬁfths less human
than other Americans.

Before our welfare committees
criticize the desertion practices of
black fathers, let’s ﬁrst ask, “How
difﬁcult is it for a black man to find
work in this country?” Contempory
black families do not disintegrate
because of weak ties. Their
break-up is effected by a number of
factors. Besides the separations
and miscegenation of slavery days,
other issues must be raised:
poverty, welfare requiremeiits and
lack of opportunities.

Thus, from “Roots”, we begin to
see that the story of the black family
goes deeper than what meets the
eye in today’s streets of Harlem or
D.C. One might realize that in
economic, social, political and
educational affairs, blacks have had

to compete at a disadvantage and
handicap. They have sweated twice
as hard to earn half as much. In this
sense, they have not been equal to
other more fortunate citizens of
America.

Beyond a new historical aware-
ness,“Roots” accomplished an-
other signiﬁcant purpose. It
emphasized the importance of
establishing one’s cultural identity.
In questioning where one has come
from, one attains a sence of home.
This personal history can only be
derived from one’s cultural origins,
and it’s these roots which instill
feelings of pride and belonging.
Thus, for this reason, we might say
that never before did a movie title so
beﬁt its theme.

James Baldwin found it difﬁcult
to find his place in history. He
wrote: “I know, in any case, that
the most crucial time. in my
development came when I was
forced to recognize that I was a kind
of bastard of the West; when I
followed the line of my past I did not
find myself in Europe, but l’l

‘ This Odd Couple is Dan Goodyear
and Eric Drescher, Pitt's only
_ ﬁrst-place winners in last month's
f-.- track invitational. Physically, these
' I roommates form a striking contract.
Shot-putter Eric is a hefty 6-0, 225
pounds, with dark hair and green
(eyes. Dan, a blond-haired,
blue-eyed high-jumper, stands 6-4
and weighs in at a lanky 175 pounds.
Both were high school Pennsylvania
state champions. Goodyear is from
Red Lion, while Drescher's home is
on Chocolate Avenue in Hershey.
 “We are the Odd Couple,” says
Eric. “I'm a slob and Dan's so neat;
_ he’s_ even got plants on his side of
g ' ‘the room. I've got a 7-Up bottle on
my desk. I've worked hard to get
that accumulation of junk."

October,” reminds Dan.

Consumer’s Union 1976 annual
questionnaire.

The best picks in small cars,
according to the survey, are: BMW
2002; Datsun 510, 1200, B210, 610
or 710; Honda Civic; Subaru; and
Toyota Corolla.

In the midsize range, Olds
Cutlass and Peugeot 504 come out
on top.

In the large size, for those with
higher-class tastes in previously
owned cars, there are the Cadillacs,
Mercedes-Benz (diesel) 4, and large
Mercurys.

When you have an idea what you
would like to look at, find someone
who knows more about cars than
you so they can help you test out the
car that looks right for you.

In the field of selling used cars
there are three main outlets: 1) the
franchised new car dealer, 2) the
used car dealer and 3) _the private
seller. Each has good and bad
points.

The new car dealer gets his used
cars from trade-ins. After acquiring
the cars, the dealer reconditions the
half-decent ones and auctions off
the, less desirable ones, usually to
used car dealers. Since the new car
dealer can_ﬁx up the previously

owned cars, he may offer some form

with the warranty and recondition-_
ed cars comes a higher price.
When buying from a used car
dealer, be even more skeptical. The
used car dealer most often gets his
cars from auctions, and buys old
police cars and retired taxis. Used
car dealers will offer cheaper prices
than new car dealers, but—don’t ex-
pect any guarantees. The best bet

for not getting gypped when dealing '

with a used car dealer is to pick one

In dealing with a private seller
(who was probably found in the
newspaper), you stand a - good
chance of getting a good buy, but
also a good chance of picking that
lemon. The private seller can often

supply- you with valuable informa- .

guarantees.

check the mileage and kickithe tires,

doing that. You'll never know

year.» Goodyear has started well,
too, with jumps of 6-8 to'hiscredit.
Last spring, this successful pair
decided to room together.

“I wanted to room with Dan
because he’s so skinny, he hardly
takes up any space,” declares Eric

'solemly. “We do get along well,
but what ‘really bugs me about Dan‘
is that at night, he grinds his teeth

in his sleep.”

“Eric ‘ snores. like a whale,”
retorts Goodyear. “Not only that,
but I have huge trouble getting him
out of bed in themorning.”

There is a knock at the door and in
come the residents of the room next
door to the Odd Couple, Pete
Strickland and Jan Medoff.

The neighbors alternate speaking
as they rave about Dan and Eric:

“Dan's a real neat person and
Eric's a...a...person. We like living
next door with all the shot puts
bouncing against our wall because
then we don't need an alarm clock.”

Strickland, a basketball player,
cites an advantage to living next
door to the couple_; “Whenever I

is come here...it’s so inspiring to
know these champions and to be so
close to the winners of sport."

Pitt Trustee R. Heath Larry: C
Textbooks, Tutus, Transactions

BY PAUL MATHEWS

‘ ‘The arts are good for business,”
says R. Heath Larry, smiling and
casually leaning back in his leather
chair. “Likewise...business is good
for‘ the arts. In fact, each would
suffer without the existence of the
other.

“Art and business are intertwin-
ed, and inextricably so,” he says.
“Each provides a variety of
inspirations necessary to the
community’s climate. Working
together, they make contributions
to the community’s development. In
Pittsburgh, U.S. Steel’s relation-
ship with the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre serves as a good illustration
of the interrelatedness of the arts
and business.”

Larry is a senior executive who
thrives on his work, pursuing it with
the dedication of a Primere Danseur
on the threshold of perfection. An
enthusiastic and active patron of the
arts, and a strong advocate of big

business’ obligation to the com-‘

munity’s standard of living, he is
both the past chairman of the board

of the Pittsburgh Ballet and the vice

chairman of the board of.the United
States Steel Corporation.

‘-‘U.S. Steel’s sponsorship and
promotion of the Pittsburgh Ballet
reﬂects our commitment to the
community’s development,” Larry
says. “My participation, aside from
being motivated by my A great
interest in the arts, is identified with
the corporation in the broadest

\ sense. For while an entity like the

corporation is essentially an econ-
omic mechanism performing a
service -for society, mainly in terms
of providing a product that people
want the employment that people
need, it nevertheless is plagued
with the fact that it’s kind of
anonymous, it’s aname, an ‘It’ with
no personality.

‘ ‘People like, I1 you will, to kick an
‘It’ in the shins,” claims Larry.
“They don’t like to kick other
people in the shins, even if they
don’t like them particularly. They
are much more reticent about
kicking Heath Larry in the shins
than they are about kicking U.S.
Steel because ‘It’ can’t kick back
and because ‘It’ doesn’t seem to
hurt: _

“Well, I think part of our effort,
especially mine, is to try to identify,
through the people of U. S. Steel and
other major corporations, the fact
that ‘It’ is involved in all the
communities in which ‘It’ pursues
its principle function of being an
economic and viable entity,” he
SayS. “In other words, ‘It’ is
involved in community develop-
ment to a substantial, degree. We
want to provide our employees and
the citizens of Pittsburgh with a
healthy cultural climate because it
basically makes living and working
here that much more enjoyable,
which, in effect, is good for the steel
industry, and, accordingly, a higher
standard of living for the entire
Pittsburgh community.”

From the upper lobby of the U.S.
Steel Building, it takes an employe

about 3 seconds, by elevator, to
reach Larry's ofﬁce on the 61st

ﬂoor. _ It took Larry, however, about
31 years to reach the same height by
climbing -the corporate ladder.

honors from Grove City College
(1935) and holds a J .D. degree from
the Pitt Law School (1937).

He started his ascent through the
corporate hierarchy in 1938 in the
area of labor relations. Today he is
in charge of labor relations, as well
as personnel relations, public
affairs and long-range planning.

In his 38 years with U.S. Steel,
Larry made it a practice to be at his
ofﬁce no later than 6:30 a.m. , giving

. him the opportunity to complete

most of his paper work before the
day’s problems, appointments and

phone calls monopolized his
attention. _ .
Each morning he rises at 5 a.m. to

_ run a vigorous two miles through his

neighborhood in Mt. Lebanon. His
trim, solid build suggests athletic
inclinations and, perhaps, even the
ability to complement the Ballet.
“My role as chairman of the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre was not to
function as its chief executive
ofﬁcer, ” he says. “That is the job of
the president, Mrs. Falk. Rather, I
simply triedpto keep together a
board of directors from a cross-
section of people in the Pittsburgh
community who appreciated the

importance of the Ballet as; one of’

the artistic evidences of the
community. T

“I also tried to develop and
maintain _a sufficient base of
ﬁnancial support from which the
Ballet could operate, and although I
attended a half-dozen board
meetings a year, I was able" to
perform most of Ballet responsibi-
lities over the telephone in my
office. - ' -

  

‘ business will ﬂourish, enriching the

“The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre is
dependent on outside support if it is
going to survive,” says Larry.
“People such as Leon Falk, the
building’s donor, and various local
executives, including myself, ex-
emplify businesses’ beneﬁcial role
in the arts.

“The Ballet operates on an
annual budget of $900,000 to $1
million. Gate receipts, even with a
full house, which the ballet has been
fortunate enough to have for the last
several years, equal only half of the
budget.

“The remaining balance comes
from patrons, especially corpora-
tions and foundations," he says.
“Big business alone will contribute
$150,000 to $250,000 this year just
to the Ballet. Business will also
contribute a sizeable sum to various
other arts organizations.

“Aside from money, local
business also contributes physical
assets to the ballet," according to
Larry. Many of its mirrors, for
example, were donated by Pitts-.
burgh Plate Glass. The steel barr
used by the dancers during practice
were donated by Petroleum Pipe
and Supply. Adding machines,
typewriters, ﬁling cabinets and
various other machines, furniture
and supplies are often contributions
from local business.

' ‘ ‘The intrinsic interrelatedness of
art and business is quite evident,”
says Larry. “Their complimentary

. natures have been growing over the

years—and I believe both art and
business are better for it. Certainly,
without the arts there would be very
little business; and without busi-
ness, much of our greatest art might
never have been known.
“However, if this interrelated-
ness is going to continue to grow
and be a positive inﬂuence on
society, I think that it’s important
for artists and businessmen each to
be understanding and supportive of
what it takes for the other _to

-ﬂourish, ’ ’ he says.

“If each would spend more time
in the future trying to understand
the other—and less time on what
may sound like invidious compari-
sons, then the interrelatedness of
each-will necessarily continue to
prosper, and both the arts and

quality of life for all of us.”

‘My Place’ Reviewed

Not Just Anyplace “

BY PETE BUTCH

A real sleeper among the Oakland
eating establishments is My Place,
located at 125 Oakland Ave. Though
it opened last November, the place
has been virtually unknown, though
interest has increased since it
started advertising a special
offering: two hot dogs and a large
coke for a dollar.

Bargains are reﬂected in the rest
of the prices, too: a bowl of
homemade soup costs 50 cents; 75
cents buys a cheeseburger or
pizzaburger; a cup of coffee goes for
a quarter; and french fried potatoes,
onion rings or mushrooms are 50
cents. Other sandwich prices are
comparable, too. And the breakfast
prices offer much-needed competi-
tion for the Pancake Kitchen around
the corner.

The food prices, service, portion
size and quality of product make My
Place economically superior to the
fast-hamburger chains. ~

The day I visited, the soupof the
day was homemade potato soup.
And it certainly looked and tasted
homemade--scalding hot, with
thick broth and chunks of potato. As
with most homemade soups,

-though, it was a little bland. A
problem easily remedied with a
little salt and pepper.

I also had a pizzaburger. It was
the same size as a McDonald's

quarter-pounder and sells at the

same price. What makes a

pizzaburger different from a’

cheeseburger is the mozzarella
cheese melted on top with garlic
salt, oregano and other Italian
spices.

It did lack a topping essential to

all genuine pizzaburgers—tomato__
sauce. It should be ﬂoating in there
along with the mozzarella and pizza
spices. Without it, the spices leave ,
one’s throat quite parched.

I had a side order of french-fried
mushrooms—the portion was ade-
quate. What was unique, however,
was that I didn't have to pay more
for the mushrooms than for a dish of
french fries. The same is true for
onion rings. V

The place is very clean. There are
booths around the interior and a
counter with stools in front. You
don't have to walk up and place your
order—the person working_the grill,
or his assistant, comes and takes
your order. When ready, the food is
brought to your table. ’

And instead of those awful
packets of sugar, there are sugar
dispensers at the tables. The cream
is in pitchers, not plastic cups. And
the ketchup comes in plastic
squeeze bottles, not foil pouches. .

The place has a warm, homey
atmosphere. You peer over the
cook's shoulder as he prepares your
order.‘ The food isn’t waiting for

performed without even getting into
the car.

1) Check the tires ﬁrst. Uneven
tire-wear means mechanical prob-
lems: a mis-aligned front end,

, defective brakes, bad shock absorb-

ers or a frame bent in an accident.
Bald spots mean the tires need
balancing.

After you are done looking at the
tires, don’t kick them. Rather grab
the top of each front tire and shake it
hard, in and out. A large amount of
free motion or clunking sounds
indicates loose or worn wheel
bearings or badly worn suspension

« joints. Repairs could be costly.

2) Next, check the body. Look for
ripples in the metal or subtle

differences in the shade of the
paint. Such symptoms may mean
the car has been in a serious
accident—the frame underneath
could be bent.

Also, ‘check for sneaky rust on the
car. Like a cancer, it is a hidden
killer in cars. Probe suspicious
spots with your ﬁnger to see if the
metal there is sound. '

3) After checking the body, test
the shock absorbers. Stand at one
corner of the car and push
down—hard—-on the bumper sev-
eral times in quick succession, then
let up quickly. If it keeps bouncing,
it probably needs new shock
absorbers. Good shocks are vital for
safety as well as for riding comfort.

4) After the car stops bouncing,

bend down and check the tailpipe. If
there is black, gummy soot in the
tailpipe, it may mean the car has
worn rings or bad valves.

While you are bent over, bend
down a little farther and check the
exhaust system, especially the
mufﬂer, for excessive rust or holes.
(If there are any holes you will hear
them, later, when you start the car).
Any holes in the muffler will mean
you’ll need a new one before
passing the next inspection.

5) While you are in the back of the
car open the trunk. Check for rust,
holes and a tight fit.

6) After checking the exterior,
move inside and give the interior a
good going-over. While ‘sitting
there inspect the upholstery for
bumps, sags, loose springs” or
surface wear. Check the front as
well as the back.

After you look at the seats, move
the front seat back and forth to
different positions and be sure it
locks in place. While the seat is
back, check for worn carpets or
signs of rust under the mats (unless
you want a car like Fred
Flinstone’s).

7) Since you are still in the
driver's seat, it is a good idea to
check the gas and brake pedal pads.

These are good indicators of how
much the car has been used. After
you check the pedal pads, press
your foot down on the brake pedal
for about a minute. If the pedal
sinks slowly it probably means a
leak in the brake system.

signs of a well-kept car.

This means it either has bad
valves or worn rings, which is
serious and costly.

11) For the next test, have the
person accompanying you feel the
engine while you depress and let up
on the accelerator. If it feels as if the
engine is clunking or rumbling find
a different car, because it probably
has bad rods or mainbearings,
which are nightmares to engines
and their owners.

12) If the car has an automatic
transmission, listen for a whining
sound. Have your assistant look
underneath the car for signs of fluid
leaks on the underside of the
engine, transmission and rear axle.

13) Now try moving the steering
wheel both ways. It shouldn’t have
more than two inches of play in each
direction. V

14) You’re now ready for the road
test, but don’t head out to Keystone

should tell. you all you need to know.

hesitation, bucking, pinging or

A Black student is denied admission to graduate school. A woman professor of ‘biochemistry is
denied tenure. A sociology professor is fired because of his political views. A staffvvorker is denied a promotion

because she was active in her union. An affirmative action officer is suddenly fired for trying to do her job.

You know these stories, you know people with similar experience, or you yourself have faced the
same situation. Many of us realize that the Posvar administration is pursuing hiring, promotion, and admissions
policies which systematically discriminate against Black people, women, those who express dissenting political

’ views, and those who support faculty and staff unionization.

For too long,'the administration has picked off individuals one by one. It's time to put a stop to
this and join together. We are holding a public hearing on discriminatory practices in order to uncover the facts in

specific cases, to publicize the width and depth of the problem, and to give concrete solutions.

As you may know, the Subcommittee on Equal Employment of the U.S.,.,House Committee on
Labor and Education is currently investigating discrimination at Pitt. We have invited members of this subcom-
mittee, as well as Pennsylvania Congresspersons and state legislators, to attend this hearing. Testimony will provide

further evidence for those legislative investigations.

Testimony will be given by students, faculty, and staff on violations of rights based upon race, sex,

Kuntu Theatre

Bringing Back ’Litt|e VW lie’

BY ETHEL M. PARRISV

The Kuntu Repertory Theatre
will present Rob Penny’s “Little
Willie Armstrong Jones’ ’ this week.
Dr. 'Vemell A. Lillie is the director
and Bob Johnson, well-known

T dancer and actor, is choreographer.

The Kuntu Repertory Theatre is a,
departmental activity and special
project of the Department of Black
Community Education, Research
and Development (DBCERD) at the
Universityof Pittsburgh. Lillie and

Penny said the theatre group was
organized in October, 1974 to
“Enhance students’ awareness of
the world around them and benefit
the communities in which they live
and study; to advance members’
and viewers’ principles, values and
philosophy through the media of
performing arts and related artistic
labors.”

According to Lillie, s he and Kuntu
members chose this play, “Not
only because it adds much character

and vitality to stale, overworked

images projected in commercial
black movies etc., but because it
also captures love, anger, pain and
warmth of feeling that allows for
personal and community growth.”
' Lillie explained that “The
concept of Kuntu in theatre is that
the audience and performers act as
one. The audience will respond
verbally to situations that they
experienced, that are performed by
the actors; audience becomes one
with performers.”

Women: Starting To Rock?

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

In the 20 odd years" rock ’n’ roll
(contemporary music, if you wish)
has been weaving its culture-mold-
ing spell over our society, women
have played only a minor role in its
performance and business.

Let's face it: the ratio of
successful male performers to
female performers is staggering. In
the business end, male executives
dominate to an even greater degree. .
This sexual unbalance exists as
strongly today as it did 20 years ago.

Try to pick out a popular female
recording artist of the '50s. It's a
tough chore. In fact, I had to ask my
parents to rack their brains to come
up with some recognizable names.

Some rang a bell with me, others

 

were as foreign as names picked at
random from the phone book.

Doris Day clicked, Rosemary
Clooney was familiar and Dinah
Shore is being rammed down our
throats five days a week on
television. But who ever heard of
Ethel Waters? Teresa Brewer? How
about Patti Page? Ithink you get my
point.

No woman emerged from the '50s
with the identiﬁable impact of
Chuck Berry, Bill Haley, Elvis (the

Pelvis) Presley or any of the

founding fathers who have been

' given the credit for getting it all in

gear.

In- the '50s, most of those
successful women performers were
packaged as the innocent girl next
door——extremely strange when one
considers that Berry and Co. were
singing about sex from the word go.

In the early ’60s, three-girl vocal
groups became the vogue. %With
names like the Shirelles, the
Chiffons and the Crystals, women
started to become visible onstage.
But take a look at an old picture of
one of these groups. They look wild
enough to bite off your head. V

  

However, all three of these
groups had a male genius behind
the scenes, calling the shots.

Remember the mousy Phil Spector?

In the mid '60s, women’s roles
nearly vanished with the onslaught
of the English invasion, the rise of

minor role in taking it to that
plateau.

A handful of female artists do
come to mind when one speaks of
women singing and writing about a
women’s situation in modern
society. .

    

Joni Mitchell, Ann and Nancy Wilson, vocalists for Heart, and Grace

Slick, each with different styles and followers, are some of the few
women who have been successful in male-dominated contemporary

music.

West Coast scene.

Wind and Wuthering
Genesis
Atco SD 36-144

Listening to a Genesis album just
twice and then attempting to review
it, is sort of like watching “Z001: A
Space Odyssey” on TV. Not even a
pipe of kif can compensate for the
pure lack of experience contained in
such acts. But yet I persist;

hopefully. somewhere among the

rash generalizations and over-
sights, lies insightful" perception.
And isn’t insightful perception the
reason people read reviews (and
why they write them)?

The audience wishes to discover
something it didn't know, even if it
-is simply whether or not they should
buy the album or see the movie. You
wanna‘ buy “Wind and Wuth_er-
ing?" Go ahead, buy it; I’ll tell you
some things I feel- about it, my
reactions and opinions—but what
the hell do I know]? V  just-listen, to

 

Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Carole
King and Carly Simon are the most
popular female artists emerging
from this category. All of them
write their own material, are
accomplished musicians and their

the damn things and make up nice
words to tell you, while I maintain
the high standards of pretension
inherent in hip journalism. Catchy
phrases? Oh yeah! Things like:
Genesis should change their name
to Apocalypse since this is deﬁnitely
the end for them. Glib generaliza-
tions, snide intellectualization? We
got ‘em both: Since Peter Gabriel
abandoned the group to its own
devices, it has derived an affected
neo-classical mise-en-scene that
unintentionally parodies their for-
mer Grand Guignol...ad nauseum.

Seriously, folks. Don’t go. I do
want to say some things about
“Wind and Wuthering." I think it
deserves serious discussion. I
found it a listenable, though not
terribly thrilling album, portentous
of what I think will be, in a few
albums, a repetitious sound. But
nonetheless, I liked it.

Genesis is a highly polished rock
group, confident of their abilities.

The Kuntu Repertory Theatre, comprised of college students,

popularity isn’t limited to just a
female audience.

These women are superstars in
anyone’s book, but they’ve been
able to stay on top in a field
dominated by men due to the
consistently high quality of their
-work. ‘

They are exceptions. Generally,
women have been stereotyped and
placed into the singer category.
Musical virtuosity and impact as an
assembled band has been almost
non-existent.

Grace Slick and Janis Joplin
became stars, but not without the

 

assistance of male backup bands.
Slick and Joplin, both powerful
vocalists and sleazy stage perform-
ers, made it acceptable for .female
performers to get as kinky onstage
as the men.

Stars Fade [in Hotel Rooms]
Kevin Westlake
Utopia Records, BUL 1-1388.

Cross Elvis Presley with Conway
Twitty and you may come up with an
Iowa farmboy with jeans too tight
and a closet fetish for sequins. Then
again you may not.

Where Kevin Westlake and this
new album ﬁts in isn’t easy to say.
Yet if one were to describe the
uneven vocal style he exhibits on
ten tracks, I'd say my characteriza-
tion isn't too bad.

Westlake wafﬂes from hounddog
hardness to dopey drawl, ﬁnding
few comfortable spots in between.
Whoever could appreciate such an
odd mix on one record probably
loves a kazoo version of “A Day in
the Life” or “Stairway to Heaven”

L as done by a marching band’.

In spite of the vocals; Westlake is.

   

 

The next step was for females to

- start to play their own instruments,

foregoing the traditional male
back-up band.

Isis and Fanny emerged in the
early ’70s as pioneers 1 in this
context. Both were groups of
women who were as adept as any
male at playing rock music. But
they had a malevolent attitude and
lacked consistency, and this has
held them back from capturing
commercial acceptance.

The Runaways are another all

female band that has emerged of '

late. However, this group’s
‘conception was primarily the
brainchild of producer-bizarro Kim
Fowley. He likes to play up the ages
of the girls in the band (all 16 to 17
years old), instead of paying more
deserved attention to the music,
‘which is as bad as day-old garbage.
The Runaways can’t be taken
seriously. They are a 100 percent
hype act.
Patti Smith has garnered more
critical attention than any female
artist this year. An excellent lyricist

Neo—C|assical Sound

(Continued from Page 12)
and able to satisfy listeners willing
to understand their statements.
They have a neo-classical sound,
especially since Peter Gabriel left
And they
have abondoned the high dramatic
content of their music. When
Garbriel exited/retired, they lost a
“performer” (in the theatrical
sense of the word) and some subtle
qualities I’ll touch upon later.

Fortunately, they were able to
restructure themselves around the
more instrumental core in their
sound. Pushing drummer Phil
Collins up front on vocals they were
able to be less like a back-up band
(never merely that, though; they
were as essential to the feel and
message of Genesis as Gabriel) and
more like a total ensemble without
the former switching of emphasis
from singer to song.

“Trick of the Tail,” the ﬁrst
post-Gabriel collection, -was a good
album. Perhaps the sudden
encounter with the unexpected
caused the vivid impression, but
“Trick” is more memorable than
“Wind.” Actually the latter is very
much the same as the former; its
presentation relies on style rather
than utilizes it. Let me specify:

“Eleventh Earl of Mar” opens
the album, and is a lot like “Dance
on a Volcano,” the opening cut of,

§ ..“Trick.” It isn’t bad. (Nothing on
.4 the record is bad, in the sense of

crude. Genesis is far from gauche.)
But it is not really new. The lyrics of
this song typify the most obvious
lack of Gabriel. Tony Banks, Mike
Rutherford, Hackett and Collins try
to deﬁne mysterious landscapes

‘ and characters in an ambiguous

fashion like Gabriel, but they
possess neither the ironic humor
nor the humorous irony that carried
“Dancing Out With the Moonlit
Knight” and “The Lamb Lies Down
on Broadway” beyond their preten-
sions. \ ‘

“One For the Vine’ ’ is essentially
a reworking of “Trick of the Tail,”

This attitude might gain her
coverage in the media on its shock
value, but it won't keep her in the
mainstream for very long.

My favorite female performers
are the two sisters, Nancy and Ann
Wilson, who head up the Seattle-
based hard-rock-and ballads band,
Heart. Their debut album,
“Dreamboat Annie,” is beautifully

diverse, and their stage act (with
the help of four males) was the
ﬁnest I saw this year.

Ann Wilson has a voice like an
angel and also an appealing,
down-to-earth quality. Nancy
Wilson has a soft but assertive

radiance about her, which comes.

out vividly in all of the sensitive
music she writes for the band.
Baez, Mitchell, King and Simon
are beyond superstar status.
They’re institutions. Like male

institutions (The Stones, Led 
Zeppelin and Dylan), their work in

the lastfew years seems to have

been done more and more by rote. ’-
Rock ’n' roll never stands still, and .

is always looking for fresh ideas and
new talent.

It will be interesting to see if any
new female performers will emerge
in the coming years to take music

further on up the road—-on their _

own.

His pipes fare a little better on
“Yankee Girl," the vaudeville-type
opener. In front of muffled
trumpets, tubas, banjo and sliding
trombones, Westlake’s mellow
croon heightens the rollicking
music.

The title track is a country-folk
tune with a nice, easy roll to it. But
here again, Westlake sounds like a
weed-in-the-mouth Tom Sawyer
whose voice is changing.

“Anticipation” is a gutsy blues
song boasting of sharp arrange-
ment. Aside from Jimmie Jewell’s
ever-present tenor sax, some
soulful female backups and a little
piano give the song a strong hit
quality (that’ll probably never be
realized in the charts anyway).

Songs like “The Girl” and
are soft,

“Sweet Green Eyes”

Take oﬁ

breezy acoustic tunes that could
bear fruit for other performers, but
with Westlake’s twenty-pound
Adam’s apple, he could only use
them as B-sides for a single release
that doesn't exist.

“Monkey Tree” is probably the
cut where his voice is most at home
with the music. Some more blues
here, Westlake allows his voice to
show its hoarse edges at the top of
the scale; up against a ragged organ
and plunky piano it meshes well.
Jewell takes up the soprano sax this
time and belts away.

If you can’t take the music, fine.

happy or sad for you.) At least we

Fine Pr'mt
  Mountaineer Country
Road For Pitt

BY CRIS HALL

 

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.—They're 4-15 now, but the Panther
basketballers refuse to give up. They head into Morgantown—ahead,
they hope, of the busloads of hill—dwelling Mountaineer fans—with
heads aloft, according to their coach, Tim Grgurich.

“They're doing a lot ofthings better now," said Grgurich, “and that's
important. They believe they can beat people, and that's a good sign."

No small part of that confidence, no doubt, comes as a result of the
Cincinnati special, that marvelous elixer whose therapeutic effects will
linger longer than Cincy coach Gale Catlett’s remarks about ofﬁciating.

“There's no doubt the Cincinnati game helped us against
Massachusetts,” said Grgurich. “When we were down by ten, we
clawed right back into a position from where we could have won. It's
good that we can do that now—it's better than losing by 30.”

There have been many contributory factors in Pitt's recent rise to
respectability——a long, gradual slope—including, in no set order: Larry
Harris’ decision to show a team of young, but talented, upstarts that he,
the team's veteran-by-default, is still the team's best until someone
proves otherwise; Sonny Lewis’ continuing adaptation to the
make-things-happen guard position, as evidenced by his rising assist
total and increasing score-when-Pitt-needs-it ability; the consistent play
of Mike Rice, who should average in double ﬁgures both scoring and
rebounding for four seasons at Pitt; the heady play Pete Strickland adds
to the now-set starting lineup; and
Ed Scheuermar_1n's apparent de-
termination to make up for what he

guts and hustle.

Add Grgur-ich's recent substitu-

tional success—Scott Nedrow when
the team needs a few baskets,
Wayne Williams for some defense,
Dave Washington or Kelvin Smith
to ﬁll a small or big, respectively,
hole in the lineup——and you come to
the realization this is a team that can
win, even if it usually doesn't.
So off they go to Morgantown—the wary coach (“They're all tough on
the road") and the conﬁdent team. They'll be going south in a
McDonald's-supplied van, ﬁlled more with hope than whatever it is
those hamburgers are made of.

' Billy Knight. Should his. current 22-points-per-game average continue

to s ind, Harris will assume Hennon's current spot at the top near the
end,of next season. Hennon leads with 1,841 points, and Knight's

becoming the ﬁrst Panther to score 2,000 points, while two of his
teart1mates—Sonny Lewis and Mike Rice—ﬁgure to end up somewhere
in Pitt's Top Ten. Ralph McClelland, a 6-7 forward at Pitt last season, is
playing in a European professional league and, wearing Belgium's

uniform, leads his division in scoring ‘and rebounding.

Though Pitt isn't releasing any
names, Jackie Sherrill has signed
some 15 high schoolers who say
they'll play for the Panthers next
season. The national letter of intent

Women Tag Rock, 69-66

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

In print, they are the Lady
Rockets, but on the court, they're
the Big Green Machine, and though
the Pitt Pantherettes pulled away in
the ﬁnal quarter for a 69-66 win
against Slippery Rock last night at
the Field House, it was tough going
all the way.

Neither team started out well.

Both were scoreless for over two

minutes until Slippery Rock tossed
in the first bucket. Pitt quickly
retaliated and the lead see-sawed
throughout the ﬁrst half. But the
Machine, master of the sleight of
hand, ripped off several Pitt passes,
while Rocket forward Carol Hale,
the game's leading scorer with 26
points, was impossible to stop.
Rocket guard Jody Gault finally tied
the game at 26-all, then ﬂipped in
the tiebreaker just before the
halftime buzzer sounded to make it
28-26 for the Rock:

Behind Hale's hot shooting in the
opening minutes of the third
quarter, Slippery Rock pulled ahead
to an even bigger lead. Fortunately,
for Pitt, forward Robin Fry became
the sparkplug of the offense,
scoring eight points in ﬁve minutes
to keep the Pantherettes in the
game. Still, Slippery Rock led by as
many _as ﬁve points.

Suddenly, Pitt began to put it
together. Center Wanda Randolph
connected on a shot and the
Pantherettes hit for six unanswered
points. Randolph put Pitt ahead,
52-50, early into the fourth quarter
and the Pantherettes never trailed
again.

Randolph led the Pantherettes in
scoring with 24 points (21 of them
collected in the second half),
rebounding with 17, and blocked
shots with 5. Forward Mimi
Senkowski added 14 points while
Fry had ten and, along with guard
Kathy Paczkowski, handed over ﬁve
assists.

For Slippery Rock, Gault tallied
14 points and Cathy Miller collected
13. .

“It was a nice win," commented
Pitt coach Pat Wallace. “I think we
played really well. Everyone
contributed. It was a real team

Wallace termed the 5-3 Rockets
as “the most physical team we've
played” and the Pantherettes will
most likely run into the Green
Machine again in post-season
competition.

Bearcats 111row Bowlers
Into Gutter ‘ lhree Times

BY JERRY VILLELLA

Taking on the undefeated,
defending league champion, St.
Vincent Bearcat bowling team in
Latrobe has never been easy, and
last Saturday the Pitt bowling team
re-learned this sad fact as it went
down to defeat in all three games.

Wearing their new team shirts for
the first time, Pitt at least had the
appearance of a cohesive squad, but
the _ four freshmen - one junior

starting lineup‘ failed to overcome.

the Bearcats’ strong performance
before several dozen vocal fans.
There were bright spots, though,
other than the new shirts. Panther
junior Al Bryce paced all bowlers in
the ﬁrst game, tossing a sparkling

si-x strikes in a row for a 245, as Pitt ’

went down 951-816.

In the second game, the Bearcats
and their fans cooled down
considerably, but the Panthers were
unable to‘ take advantage, losing
Though freshman Rich
Louden threw a197, his teammates,
plagued throughout the season by
inconsistency, couldn't follow his
lead. '

Each‘ of the bowlers on whom
sophomore captain Geoff Joseph
has most relied (Bryce, Louden,
freshmen Steve Fendler, Mark
Suekoff, Mark Randall, and Joseph
himself) has shown he is capable of
delivering excellent games on
occasion, but rarely have three or
four of them had good days at the
same time.

A glance at the ﬁve St. Vincent
scores in the ﬁrst game: 187, 201,
201, 176 and 186, demonstrates the
value of ﬁve very good games
versus Pitt's frequent pattern of one
spectacular effort and four medio-
cre ones.- Still, the bowlers are
young, and ‘will improve with the

  
   
 

n.

I.

The team showed some promise
of developing this concentration,
even threatening to salvage the
third ‘game before the Bearcats put
it away in the ﬁnal frames, 845-798.

Joseph, vwho declined to put
himself in the lineup at all, made a
little history by substituting fresh-
man Jacqui Kemp, the ﬁrst female
to compete in the Southern Division
of the Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Bowling Congress
(WPIBC).

“We substitute whoever seems
to be throwing best on the practice
lanes,_ and Jacqui was ready when

we needed her,” Joseph said. He ‘

often complains of the difﬁculty in
deciding who to start and when to
substitute,.and has not yet settled
on the best starting ﬁve.

He must decide, though, because
the team's next outing "will be
February 12/ at Beaver Community
College for the WPIBC Invitational
tournament. Each team may use
only ﬁve bowlers, without substitu-
tion, for nine games. Pitt can't help
but beneﬁt from the experience,
and since the Resident Student
Association will fund the trip, the
ﬁve Pitt bowlers who compete will
probably be throwing more games
in one day than they would if paying
usual lane prices.

PHILADELPHIA—A bird in
hand might be worth two in the
bush, but a hockey game out of hand
isn't worth athing. The Pitt Hockey
Club found that very true in a 6-4
loss to the Junior Flyers here last
Saturday in a ﬁasco that kept the

Panthers from gaining two victor-

'\

res.

The very next day, in nearby
West Chester, freshman goalie
Marty Bradley turned in a 4-0
shutout, his seventh consecutive
appearance in the nets without a
loss, in helping Pitt to a victory over
the Mainline Hockey Club and
raising the Panthers’ record to
9-2-1. .

been reversed,” ‘said assistant
coach Bob Klemz, who directed the
team in place of head coach Len
Barcalow. “We weren t In
condition for the ﬁrst game. but We
sharpened up quitea bit for the
second.”

After a bus trip of over six hours,
the Panthers stepped onto the ice
with rubbery legs and were met by
two quick Junior Flyer goals in the
opening three minutes of action and
were down. 3-1, at the period’s end.
Curt Hetz put Pitt on the scoreboard
after taking a pass from defense-
man Larry Gallick and escaping up
the middle for a breakaway with
8:45 remaining.

“I think that really affected play
in the first period," defenseman
and alternate captain Bob Arturo
said of his bus ride-weary team.
“Even mentally, nobody was
prepared. We could have beaten
those guys.”

Despite the fact the Junior Flyers
outskated Pitt throughout much of
the game and outshot the Panthers,
42-16, it was a nip and tuck battle.

Dave Ellson got the first of his two
goals for Pitt, knocking in a rebound
with seven minutes elapsed in the
second frame, to cut the Junior
Flyers’ lead to 3-2. But the talented
team of high school and college age
amateurs, who raisedtheir record to
an impressive 22-5, stormed back to
up the margin to 5-2 after a number
of defensive lapses by the Panthers.

BY MARIA SCIULLO

For true “Christians and the
lions” effect, few places can match
West Virginia Universi_ty’s Coli-
seum.

This $10.4 million structure, with

v a seating capacity of 14,000, is the

site of tonight's basketball game
between Pitt and the “wild and
wonderful” Mountaineers;

For the past seven years, no
matter how good the Panthers have
been, they have yet to win in the
Coliseum. The arena, however, is

not really to blame. WVU fans are L

famous for their dver-exuberance
and many delight in heckling Pitt
players, coaches, fans and even
ballboys. In this atmosphere, it can
be difficult to concentrate.

Most rivalries between teams are
built up by the press. Head coach

we just go

Tim Grgurich explains, “We don’t
go into a game looking for a fight,
in to play hard
basketball.”

Regardless of the score, a West I

Virginia crowd stays alive, and has
been known to throw _objects onto
the court. Last year, with Pitt
trailing by a sizable margin, the
Panther bench was showered with
garbage and other paraphernalia.

“Fans will be fans,” sighed
Grgurich. “The ones who throw
bottles, though, have to be sick,
because they could just as easily
hurt one of their own players.”

Player reactions _to WVU’s home
court and fans differ. Pete
Strickland observed, “Last year,
they threw so many Frisbees at us, I
thought I was _in‘Schenley Park.”

Some Cats even look forward to
this coming game. “I love playing

screaming, ’ ’ claimed Scott Nedrow.
“Emotionally, that’s when I get as
keyed-up as I can possibly get.”

Tonight, when the ﬁrst cries of

skaters,” Klemz analyzed. “It
showed in the first period, but we
were really going by the third. You
can skate and skate and skate, but if
you’re not in top condition for it,
then you’re hurting.”

In the locker room between the
second and third periods, the Pitt
skaters psyched themselves into not
giving in to the team which had
handed them their only other defeat
this season. And the Panthers could’

have pulled the game out of the fire. .

Two goals early in the ﬁnal period
narrowed the lead to 5-4 and Pitt
seemingly had the control of the
game they had failed to gain until
that time. Hetz tallied his second
goal ofthe game with a minute gone
when the Junior Flyer defensemen
failed to pick up a loose puck in the
slot and the Pitt center ﬂipped the
puck over the goalie's glove hand.

Six minutes later, defenseman
Rick Stein found winger Bill Gedeon

with a pass at the blue line and \

Gedeon skated in alone down the
left wing,.passing to a breaking
Ellson in the slot for an easy goal
that put Pitt within one.

The Junior Flyers again bounced
back, tipping in a’ shot from the
face-off circle to the right of goalie
Larry Newill, to reach the 6-4 ﬁnal
score. But the circus-type ending
ruined a good contest. With 11
minutes remaining, Hetz was
stopped on a breakaway and, five
minutes later, Junior Flyer captain
Alex Jackson was stopped by
Newill—not with his goalie stick,
but ﬁsts; and not once, but twice.

The referees had lost control of
the game in the third period and,
after Jackson swung his stick at

that’s all," said Klemz. “We just
got ourselves into a situation where
we got too little in too little time. We
had the opportunities, but the
penalties killed us.”

Conversely, the Mainline-Pitt
battle on Sunday, a well-played,
free-wheeling affair, showed no
penalty calls until there were six

minutes left in the second period. ’

After resting overnight and much of
the next afternoon, the Panthers
were in top skating form against the
burly Mainline squad, which is an
open age group organization (the
youngest player is 19, while the
player-coach is 50).

Pitt scored its first goal five
minutes into the contest, when Gary
Fries shot and Hetz batted in the
rebound after taking several swipes
at the free puck. Two minutes later,
Gedeon raised the score to 2-0 by
blasting a wicked slap shot just
inside the blueline to the left of the
Mainline net.

Gedeon then proceeded to set up
Ellson for Pitt’s third goal early in
the second frame and Smith
slammed in the final tally off the
Mainline goalie’s mask six minutes
later.

The third period was plagued by
penalties, but all the Panthers had

periods of the opening game hurt
the weary Panthers...The Junior
Flyers game was played at the
University of Pennsylvania rink,
donated by the Class of 1923. . . .This
weekend the Panthers will travel
east again to face the Princeton J V’s
and the Naval Academy.

Resurrected DeMuro
Embalms WVU, 80-33

BY JIM GEFSKY

Jerry DeMuro’s West Virginia
“fan club’ ’ was ready, greeting him
with the sign “Jerry DeMuro dies
today—February 5, 1977.” De-
Muro responded to their “adora-
tion” by breaking two pool records
and leading Pitt to an 80-33 victory
over the Mountaineers last Satur-
day at Morgantown.

Although DeMuro was Pitt’s
leader, the rest of the tankers were
not far behind as Pitt won 10 of 13

50-yard freestyle in 22.2,

  
   

and’
classmate Mike Connor’ won the
200-yard breaststroke with a time of
2:16.7. ‘

Pitt also scored victories in the

_ relays and diving. The freestyle

relay team anchored by Schepner

won with a time of3:15.3, and Dave ' 

Civis anchored his medley relay" to
victory in 3:39.4. Tom Fatyol did
exceedingly well when he took the
three-meter diving with a score of
289.8. .

in Exposed.     

.;   .   lg Robin Hood. He lived in a place called Sherwood Forest with a band
5‘     of Merry Men. Or, as they were l<nown to local townspeople, Oddballs.
' ~”  S   Robin and his men were dijferent. W/hich is why they were forced
‘f  to live in a drafty forest. They preferred to wear green tights instead of
  regular trousers. That explains why they walked so funny on cold days.
It may also be the reason were called the Merry Men. But that’s another story.
Over the years the social life in Sherwood Forest tapered off due to the opening of
 several singles pubs on the other side of Nottingham. So Robin and his men amused
themselves by shooting arrows at trees, eating with their fingers, and telling each other
“Knock, Knock” jokes.  

    

. A their Public Relations man  it would be good for their image.
Robin and the Merry Men were forced to drink beer with all their meals ever since

  ‘ months Jot}; nothinghs to  but beer; they needed a change. And Ztnderstandably so.
