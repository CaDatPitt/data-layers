Personality Studes
Ready For Contest

From the minute of its publica-
tion, the announcement of the

caused a sensation among the stu
dents like a “pop quizz." Every-
where a keen interest was shown,
students of every class and in every
building were attracted by the con-
test in which there are no eligibility
rules.

The idea, as announced in last
week's Weekly, is for the students
themselves, regardless of their class,
to vote by ballot for the most pop-
ular Pitt collegian and Pitt coed.
Popularity or personality—that’s
what counts.

The date of the contest has been
put forward so as not to conflict
with exams, according to Sunny

F o r in al Registration
Period At Mosque
February 2, 3, 4

Enabling students to transform
boring registration days into days
of carefree vacation, complete mid-
year enrollment is now possible
without the long, tiresome procedure
which has hitherto characterized the
-registration period. For the ﬁrst
time in the history of the Univer-
sity, students pre-registering may
pay their tuition at the same time,

thus eliminating the necessity of
their attending Syria Mosque dur-
ing registration week.

The first student to take advan-
tage of the new arrangements was
Henry M. Stebbins, a major in Eng-
lish in the graduate school. At
10:30 o'clock Saturday morning,
January 17. the day following an-
nouncement m the Weekly of the
new plan, he .had ﬁlled out his cards
and paid _his tuition. Following
closely behind him C.'Stanton Bel-
four, assistant director of the Uni-
versity extension bureau, also
went through the process of regis-
tration, and was duly awarded sec-
ond honors in order of appearance.

New Facilities

With the furnishing of Room 8 in
State Hall to take care of mid-
year registration, facilities are now
available for the enrollment of 1,600
students before the end of the se-
mester._ Already the number of
pre-registering students has sur-
D9-S-Spd . that of_ revious years, ac-
cording to J. Gil ert Quick, Univer-
sity registrar.

The process of pre-registration
begins with the procuring of study
lists in the registrar's office. When
these have been filled in by the stu-
dents, they are returned to Room 3,
State Hal , when class cards are ob-

returned, and with the payment of
the-tuition fees. the process is com-
"pleted,’ 1rnd"witii the exception of
examination week, the students are
“at case” until the ‘opening of the
following semester.

Tuition

Students who are not prepared to
meet their tuition payments at pre-
registration may ﬁll out all the
forms and complete their registra-
tion with the exception of the tui-

Muirliead, Inventor
For Registrar, Dies

The flag at State Hall ﬂew at
half-mast Wednesday and Thursday
for the man who was in charge of
all the mechanical set-up of the
Syria Mosque during registration,
and now officials are in a quandary
a.s_to his successor. This man was
William M. Muirhead, mechanician
at the School of Mines, and known
as “Billy” to the students.

_ It was “Billy” who put the reg-
istration procedure at the Mosque
on_ a smooth working basis. He con-
ceived the bulletin-bell board and
bell which is rung when a class is
closed to facilitate checking by the
advisers and saw that it was in per-
fect working order.

“Billy” was also instrumental in
getting traffic signs from the City
Traffic department, painting them
blue and gold _and placing them in
strategic positions on the floor to
direct the ebb and flow of students,
faculty and officers. “Billy,” too,
designed the standards which mark
the various tables at registration.
Muirhead died last Monday eve-
ning at his home, 735 N. Negley
avenue, after being ill for a month.
He is survived by his widow, Mrs.
Jessie Fulton Muirhead. He was a
member of the Masonic order and
the Shriners. Funeral service was

Wednesday night. Council also
granted its authorization of a. pro-
posed campaign to facilitate the
“Pitt in China" movement.
jKreimer was selected out of a
group of three candidates. Accord-

in that year Council Passed a reso-
lution that an American University
should not encourage the forcing of
religion upon an unwilling people.
According to Dr. Henry, Lingnan
University abolished all compulsory
religious training in 1925. At pres-
ent the University has ..n enroll-
ment of about 1,800 students, the
campus containing not only the col-
lege, but also a high and grammar

schools.
Five Schools

The University has ﬁve schools,
Arts and Science, Agriculture, Seri-
culture, » Business Administration,
and Engineering. It receives an-
nually an endowment of $260,000
from the Province in which Canton
is located.

Dr. Henry Frank, considered the
best chemist in China, was sent over
by Pitt in 1923. It is Dr. Henry's
hope that the University, here, will
again participate in this movement.

The continuation committee, un-
der the chairmanship of Walter
Rome, graduate manager of student
activities, has proposed a campaign
to accumulate funds for the ﬁnanc-
ing of a Pitt student to take a staff
position at the Chinese University.
Council gave an unanimous approval
of the campaign.

Biddle Chosen Charter Day

At a recent meeting of O.D.K.,
where plans for Charter Day were
formally discussed, Theodore Biddle,
assistant to.the dean of men, was
chosen social chairman of the Char-
ter Day Banquet which will be held

a committee was authorized to se-
lect a place for the banquet, which

Dr. Gustave Schramm, national
president of O.D.K., announced
that invitations for the banquet
have been extended to members of
the national council of the honorary
activities fraternity. The main
speaker has not yet been chosen
but many prominent men are under
consideration. Invitations will also
be extended to a. few promiinenrt
persons who will be initiated as hon-
orary members at the banquet.

The meeting was in charge of vice
president Edward Schultz, due to
khie eibsence of the president, Robert

Awaits Deans’ Decree

The approval or disapproval of
the petition submitted by three stu-
dents concerning the reinstatement
of Pitt Week will be announced in

According to the plan, as pro-
posed by Robert Kleeb, Col. '31,

ternity sweepstakes and track meet,
the coed parade and other features
of Senior Week in which the entire
University participate will be held
in the ﬁrst week of May. The func-
tions which are distinctly senior af-
fairs, however, will be held over for

P University Phone Operator

Receives 2,40-0 Calls Daily

Will there be skating in Schen-
ley Park today? Can you give me
the Bugology department? Who
buys the rats and mice? What's
Mr. Smith’s initials? Where's he
live? What's his telephone num-
ber? _ Those are just a few of the
questions asked of the telephone
operators in State Hall.

There have been as many_as 2,400
calls 8 days so that the llfe of a
telephone operator at the Univer-
vtrsity is rather busy considering all
the'questions that are asked by im-
patient students. Service is al-

but when a line is busy, callers be-
come inquisitive and want to know:
who are they talkin to? How long
will they be? Wel , what are they
talking about?

Even good-natured operators are
annoyed when people call and say,

“Is this the University?” “Uni
versity of Pittsburgh?” “Mayﬂower
3500?” And then ﬁnally ask for
their party. If you’ll say what you
want and that quickly, you’ll cer-
tainly be appreciated by the oper-
ators.

There are 2_69 telephones in the
University and sometimes it seems
that all of them are busy at once,
but it's really around noon and be-
tween 4:30 and 5 that the operators
are busiest. Registi-ar’s office,
Building and Grounds, and Students
Activities are busiest departments.
Operators do not handle telegrams,
but all long-distance calls should _be
sent out through the Ilniversity
operators.

There are three operators, Miss
Anne Flaherty, Miss Marie McAfee
and Miss Stella Callahan, _whose
voices you hear when you llft the
receiver--“ University.”

YMHA Play

Players G i v e “Credentials”
As Latest Production

 

 

Students prominent in dramatic
activities at the University and at
Carnegie Tech will make up the cast
of the Y. M. and W. H. A. Players
latest production, “Credentials,”
opening at the “Y” January 2'1.

Jacques Le Vine, Col. ’31, has
been cast for the male lead, playing
the_role' of the old general, Sme-
tanich, in the story of the play.
Frances Heckert, formerly of the
Tech drama department, who has
been doing dramatic work in Paris
since her graduation, plays the part
of a Russian aristocrat.

_Others in the cast include Helen
Sisenwain, a sophomore in the Tech
Drama department, who plays the
Pfirt Of 9- young Russian Commu-
H1813.‘ Pavel; Betty McDonald, Lydia
Patterson, Milton Brauman, former-
ly of Pitt; Kathryn De Roy, also of

Tech; Louis Lowenstein, Isobel
Levin and Harvey Eﬁmove.
Moscow -

The setting of the play is in Mos-
cow and the characters combine mil-
Itary men, peasants, proletarians,
aristocrats,and “party men,” who,
when worked into the play, create
many farcical and amusing situa
tions.

“Credentials” is the first play
from. the pen of Nikolas Erdman
and IS a satire on both the old Rus-
sian dynasty and the present So-
viet Union. The rigid Sovietyesn.
sorship at first threatened to
smother the play for its satirical
quality, but the same quality of the
comedy saved it for publication, in
spite of its direct scoffing. The play
will probably have a three-night run
commencing January 27 and will be
open to the public.

New Course

Sieg, H 0 lb r o ok Announce
Joint Science Project.

 

Dean L. P. Sieg of the College
and Dean E. A. Holbrook of the
schools of engineering and mines an-
nounced today the establishment of
a new four-year joint course in
physics and engineering. Students in
the freshman and sophomore classesw
of the two schools may enroll in the
new_ course ‘at _Syria Mosque regis-
tratign beginning Monday, Febru-

a .

I-leading to the degree of Bachelor
of Science in physics and engineer-
ing, the new course will be limited
to a carefully selected group of stu-
dents in_ the college and schools of
engineering and mines. Approval
of Professor H.- E. Dyche, head of
the; department of electrical engin-
eering,- and Dr. A. G. Worthing,
head of the physics department in
the college, is necessary for regis-
tration in the newly estabfished cur-
riculum. - . _

Math and Physics A’

Deans Holbrook and Sieg, who
have worked for more than a year
on the details of this innovation,
have assumed "that men taking the
course will have special fondness for
mathematics and physics. They wish
to emphasize the fact that accept-
able freshmen and sophomores can
transfer at registration without loss
of time or credits.

Two innovations will feature the
coming registration period. No long-
er will the nerves of _tired students
be Jarred by the clang of the bell.
announcing the closing out of class-
es. In its ‘place, mimeographed
sheets will be distributed every half-
lwul‘. announcimt the classes whose
quotas have been ﬁlled.

The ‘second feature of the ap-
proaching registration is the fact
that perforated sheets of cards will
take the place of the familiar col-
ored books. It is expected that this
system will greatly sim lif the
routine. of registration, e iminating
the necessity of the students turn-
ing back the pages for reference,
and the mislaying of any of the
cards.

And Found Department
In Cold Proposition

 

Some people are collegiate by
choice, others by necessity. On
the campus. there is a man with
a size seven and one-eighth head
who left his derby in the Univer-
sity cafeteria one day last week.
For one not used to going bare-
headed in the kind of weather
we've been having lately, this
must be a cold proposition al-
though the individual may be one
who boasts of more than one hat.
Be that as it may, straws are
mighty uncomfortable, and last
year's felts are too ﬂoppy. Thus
there remains in the Lost and
Found Department, State Hall, the
described bowler waiting for its
rightful owner.

Along with the “iron lid” _are
some other cold weather aids:
scarves and two pairs of ladies’
gloves. Wintry blasts are sup-
posed to take the place of cos-
metics, but for the two coeds that
ﬁnd that these winds need to be
supplemented by something more
substantial, their com acts are be-
ing kept for their as ance.

Justices Of Senior Court
Preside On W:S.G.A.Benc/1
At All Trials But Murder

 

Courts are contemptible places.
Especially are they so, when evi-
dence goes against the defendant.

But not so with Senior Court. The
Court is all for the offender. Every
beneﬁt of the doubt oes to her.

Quite often the ights at the
Heinz House can be seen burning
late into the morning. On these
times, one can be fairly sure, that
Senior Court is trying a case. Lights
burn, hair splits, meals are missed.
The “tip-staff,” Olive Cole, keeps
witnesses awake. The verdict ’ 18
given. _

But, even though there are occa-
sional trials which come up, the
fundamental operation of the court
is not so menial, Senior Court,
whether we ai°e'a.'wa're ‘of’ it/or riﬁﬁ
forms public opinion. Moreover, it
is a co-operating force between the
women students and the administra-
tion.

Senior Court is a clearing house
for all committee chairmen and com-
mittee members. In case of con-
flict, to make sure that a woman is
not taking too many oﬂices, Senior
Court is consulted.

The history of the Court was be-
gun when, eleven years ago, Dean
Thyrsa . Amos drew up the plans
for W. S. G. A. As she planned.
there are legislative, executive and
judiciary departments. Senior Court
is judiciary. It consists of ﬁve sen-
ior women chosen by the executive
committee of W. S. G. A. The wom-
en on the present bench are:

Hermine Ruolf, Col. '31, chief jus-
tice; Florence Luman, Col. '31,
marshal; Frances Stuart, Col. '31,
clerk; Olive Cole, Ed. '31, marshal,
aﬁldl Ann Rosenswieg, Col. ’31, mar-
s a .

Five years ago the Customs com-
mittee requested Senior Court to
take over their trials. Besides the
olfehses of freshmen, the court now
takes over questions of morals and
attitude. Its judgments are always
as constructive as possible, and no
bad feelings are left. Where rec-
ommendations are made, the admin-
istration rarely refuses to accept
them.

Miss Ruoff reports that as yet no
murder case has gone down on the
court’s books.

Work tars
On Cap-Gown

Murlatt Re-engaged to Direct
Production’

 

Active work on Cap and Gown’s
1931 show, “What's Up?” will start
soon after the opening of the sec-
ond semester. A new method of se-
lecting the cast and choruses for the
show will be used. Immediately fol-
lowing the large 0 smoker, the
date of which wil be announced
soon, tryouts for the various depart-
ments of Cup and Gown will be held
After a short period of tryouts se-
lections will be announced and re-
hearsals will start promptly.

William Marlatt, director of last
year’s show, “Manhattan Pre-
ferred,” has again been engaged to
direct the entire production. At
present, he is engaged in theatrical
work in the East, but is expected
to be here in a few weeks.

The scenery for “What’s Up” is
s revelation in stage craft. One of
the scenes is laid undersea and
promises to be one of the best in
the show. All types of recent stage
equipment will be emplo ed to give
novel effects. Man of t e sets will
be constructed by t e technical stan
under the capable supervision of Di-

prairie land, and morning after
morning one can see as many as
three thousand heads in a large
ﬁeld, gathered together to protect
themselves from lions.

Dr. Arbuthnot considers the lion
the most dreaded animal in the
jungle. He described how a lion
often kills an animal. by jumping on
its back, throwing a forepaw around
its neck, then pulling back until the
victim's neck breaks. “The lion's
courage is certainly admirable. I
remember one lion in particular
which I shot. Badly wounded, it lay
on the ground and bit its paw off,
angry because it was unable to ﬁght
back.” He told of how the hyena
lurks in the bushes until the lion
has ﬁnished eating one of its vic-
tims, then gathers the scraps. Then
the remainder is eaten by vultures.

When the party came across ani-
mals while driving in the truck,
they occasionally chased them to‘
see how fast they could run. They
found that ostriches could go as
fast as forty-two miles per hour,
rhinoceri as high as twenty-ﬁve
miles, and one” giraffe travelled up
to thirty-seven miles, according to
the truck's speedometer.

Dr. Arbuthnot summarized his
impression of ‘Africa in saying,
“Africa has the atmosphere, to me,
of making man feel ﬁitrusive. Walk-
ing through tall gass, burned golden
by the sun, one may meet such
strange animals, and the unex-
pectedness of it all never failed to
make me feel like an intruder.”

Comic Culls
College Wit

Panther Announces Section
For Downtown Division

 

The “best humor of 100 college
comics” throughout the country is
the feature of the Contemporary
Number of the Panther which came
out this week. Cartoons from “The
Purple .Cow,” the “Gargoyle,” the
“Phoenix,” the “Tiger,” the “Lam-
poon,” and many other leading col-
lege humor magazines are in the
issue, giving it a variety that
makes every page seem like anoth-
er act of a good vaudeville show.
The best of short jokes and humor-
ous articles vie with the cartoons in
hilariousness and wit. ‘

For its own features, the Panther
has, “Things About Town,” _“Pitt
Patter,” “Downtown Ramblings,”

Theatre,” “Hazard Page,” “Van-
ity Fair Page,” and a short story.

In “Things About Town,” the
Agony Co-lumner reveals, among
other things, the most embarrassing
‘situation of the year, and the big-
gest nut in the town. “Downtown
Ramblings,” a new feature, is a
page from the downtown night sec-
tion, which shows that all that hap-
pens in the daytime is not neces-
sarily all.

Marvin T. Herrick went to New
York, saw six of the best plays,
and reports in “Theatre” his im-
pressions of “Green Pastures,”
“Once in a Lifetime,” and “Grand
Hotel,” the only three with a good
batting average.

“Hard to Figgcr,” a new short
story by Cecil Trout, "racing along
hreathlessly until its very surpris-
ing end, is a story characteristic of
the author whose stories have ap-
peared in “Liberty” and in other
magazines.

In the words of Hiram Howard,
who edited the Contemporary Num-
ber: “It’s a real anthology of col-
lege humor of the past year, with
its regular features above par.”

A pathetic incident of crutches, cribs, etc., and the student took place

idisgustingly wise. A week before the Final Math Exam he started trans-

 lously ﬁlling his cuffs could have been utilized in memorizing the formulae
lwith minutes left over. This, however, was more romantic. Awakening
on the morning of the exam, he could not locate his shirt. He yelled to

“Pittsburgh is a dramatic work-

Telegraph, in a talk before the
Women’s Association of the Univer-
sity Wednesday afternoon, when he
spoke on “The Season's Drama” at
the home of Mrs. M. K. McKay.

added that, generally, when a play
is appnoved in Pittsburgh, it is also
received well in New York,

One of the exceptions to this rule,
h'0WeVeI'. Was “Scarlet Sister Mary,”
with Ethel Barrymore, which was
presented and received well here last
October, while it was a failure in
New York. Mr. Seibel attributed
this to the fact that it was a. poor
play, and. that Ethel Barrymore
was too_d-igniﬁed for the part.

He cited another exception, in
which a play which was not well_ re-
ceived here became very popular in
New York. This was “Pagan Lady”
with Lenore Ulric. He believed that

Lanfear .Talks' For
Alpha Kappa Psi

Speaking at the second Alpha
Kappa Psi, professional commerce
fraternity, luncheon meeting, held
Tuesday afternoon in the Roosevelt
Hotel, Dr. Vincent Lanfear, head of
the downtown division, continued his
talk on “Business Trends.” Dean
Hays, president of the alumni chap-
tee*, in a brief talk praised the fra-
tsrnity on the success of its ﬁrst
meeting and congratulated the ‘pro-
gram committee for the selection of
the topics to be discussed at future
meetings. ’

In his talk,_Doctor Lanfear dis-
cussed the rise of the price level of
standardized commodities in spite of
the decrease in manufacturing cost.
“This is due in part,” said Doctor
Lanfear, “to the lack of balance be-
tween production and consumption.
Since the prediction_ of market de-
mand is virtually impossible, the
manufacturer overestimates the po-
tential consumption power and this
creates a surplus.” _

Next week the topic to be dis-
cussed is “Proposals for Balance in
Production and Consumption.”

Committee Discusses
Chinese Room Plans

The Chinese room committee dis-
cussed further plans for the Chinese
room with Mr. Henry K. Murphy,
noted authority in Chinese architec-
ture, at a special meeting held last
Wednesday morning at 8 o'clock in
the waiting room of the Pennsyl-
vania Station. Mr. Murphy, who
sails to China. from Seattle tomor-

York Wednesday morning and re-
mained here only an hour and a
half. Upon reaching ‘China, Mr.
_Murphy will confer with Dr. Lai,
the head of the Chinese room com-
mittee, on the other side.

Mr. Teng_-Kwei, a student at Hat-

the Chinese ‘room, spent -several
days here during the past week. He
attended the meeting at which Mr.
Murphy was present and also con-
ferred with Mrs. Ruth C. Mitchell.

      Article Starts Reaction

Opposes Colonel

Editor, The Pitt Weekly:
Despite the Weekly’s cautious
warning that “the article. . . .is Lt.
Col. Cullen's personal observations,”
we are moved to answer the com-
mandant’s able article on the edi-
torial page of the current issue of
the Pitt Weekly, January 16, 1931,
because of many impressions left by
the article which we would question.
It is difficult to consider the dis-
cussion point by point, since it cov-
ers such a. wide range. However, it
is worthy of note that the local
commandant has carefully avoided
many of the more tricky positions
which have been stumbling blocks to
other defenders of the R. O. T. C.,
such as (1) POPULARIZATION by
the “pretty - girl-honorary-officer"
racket, the non-regulation snappy
uniforms, and the prizes, awards,
and honors; (2) the “developing
manl physiques” claim, so thor-
oug y rejected by leading physical
education authorities; and (3) the
compulsory feature in many state-
controlled schools (which accounts
for a great many of the 95,000 stu-
dents cited in the article). _
Being limited by space and abil-
ity, we shall consider only a few
points. In his next to the last par-
agraph, the professor modestly ad-
mits that his department presents ‘to
the student the “true facts in the
matter of national preparedness for
war. . .” “Military science deals
solely with cold facts, truths; and
truths alone are laid before the stu-
dent.” Granted that Col. Cullen is
entirely sincere, we may ask where
he gets his semi-monopoly on “cold
truth; and we wonder if all the “mil-
lions of people who disagree with
the War Department idea of the
“facts” on preparedness, and of the
“responsibilities and obligations. .
(of) a man” are necessarily far, far
away from the army-guarded truth.
Secondly, we can not B358 _bY the
commanda.nt’s rare dissertation on
the democracy of American colleges.
and the overwhelming intelligence
of the average college'maii._ Aside
from noticing the nation-wide aglr
tation against present methods of
University control, led by the coun-
try’s foremost ‘educators, and also
mentioning. again the conipiilsoljy
feature of R. 0. T. C. training in
many schools, as well_ as the re-
quirement for completion of the
two years, once embarked upon. 85
a requisite for graduation in our
own school, we smile and D355 '°_V1,th'
out comment this daring exposition
of campus life. _

Moving on hurriedly, let us_coii-
sider the 30 per cent increase In R-
0. T. C. enrollment at P1_tt;_ and let
us wonder how much _of ,1t is trace-
able to the “ass1mil_ation’ of the 10-
cal band by the military “H13?-

In the fourth place, consider the
vindication of the_ R. O, T.  on the
charge of promoting n‘l111t9-rlsmz‘ Lt-
Col. Cullen is appalled at the pre-
posterous” charge that the arm)’
gives its students any class con-
sciousness or any “d1SP1'0P01‘t19n'
ate sense of the. .power of a nation
in arms.” But we believe he is 80'
ing against the orthodox War De_-
partment idea, for we read that M81-
Gen. MacArthur, chief of staff of the
U. S. Army, tells a convention _of
Reserve Officers that “a war-like
s ii-it, which alone can create and
civilize 9. state, is absolutely essen-
tial to national defense and to na_--
tional perpetuity. . . ." Our 8118131‘
cions are further aroused when we
see a quotation from the. War De’;
partment manual‘ on “Cltlzenshlp
with the following startling para-
graph:

“Destructive Idealism. The at-
tempt to undermine the Nation
from within is more serious than
the threat of armed forces from
without. An impractical and de-
structive idealism called interna-
tionalism is being propagated by
certain foreign agitators and is
being propagated by certain for-
eign agitators and is being
echoed and re-echoed by many of
the Nation's ‘Intellectiials.’ Its

efforts are to combat the spirit
of patriotism, to destroy that

spirit of nationalism without
ghich no people can long en-
ure."

Is this not a "disproportionate
sense of the power of a nation 111
arms”? Is this an unbiased atti-
tude, ably ﬁtted to deal with those
rigid, true facts? -

Finally, we wonder if Col. Ou-llen’s
slighting references to some “insin-
uations” _of “our critical friends"
509,8 not Ignore the large dimensions
_wh1ch opposition to military train-
ing has reached. Do Pitt students
know that there are many major or.
Eanizations with thousands of mem-
bers (such as the Committee on
Militarisin in Education) whoge sole
concern 18 that imminent danger to
the welfare of our civilization of-
fered by militaristic agencies? That
fnany other important organizations
include strenuous efforts against
militarism in their program? ' And

are actively opposing the R. O. T.
C.? It is also worthy of note that
the World Student Christian Associ-
ation, of which the Pitt Y. M. C. A.
and the Y. W. C. A. are parts, is one
of the leaders in the struggle for in-
ternational understanding, for non-
militarism, and, incidentally: for the
minimizing of the inﬂuence of such
agencies as the R. O. T. C.

We trust we are not narrow-
minded on this topic; we would like
to be corrected on any points where
we are obviously wrong; above all,
we should like to hear further dis-
cussion on this issue.

Certainly the comm_andant’s ﬁnal
paragra h appears fair enough at
first g ance: , “If this (military
training) he treason, in the eyes of
our critical friends. . . . .then let it
be.” Why are the critical friends
unwilling to abide by such a peace-
ful conclusion? Because, to_ever-
increasing millions of people in _our
country today who neither consider
it “treason,” not yet are content to
“let it be,” the continuance of prep-
aration of the minds and materials
of our nation for a Bigger and Bet-
ter war is not only unimaginative,
unpatriotic, unChristian and unin-
telligent, but the narrow acceptance
of the inevitability of militarism is
a serious obstacle to grappling with
a problem, which, if not solved, 
make the ruins of our civilizatio ..
laughing stock for the gods.

Tyson Raps Charity
As Unemployment Aid

“Unemployment is the Achilles
Heel of the modern capitalistic body
and we are meeting the situation
with the inadequate and altogether
unsatisfactory agencies of charity,”
declared Dr. F. D. Tyson, professor
of economics, before the Inquiry
Club of the Y. M. and W. C. A. last
Wednesday.
Dr. Tyson spoke before a repre-
sentative group of students and
faculty members and attacked the
current business depression and un-
employment citing ‘six propos
remedies for the situation. “Cy-
clical depression, Seasonal produc-
tion, techiiological ounerriployment,
and defects ' in the organization of
labor markets are the causes of un
employment, he continued.

-“We have innumerable remedies
proposed for the alleviation of such
conditions of unemployment which

had the severest tests and suffered
the severest set—backs. The demor-
alization of charitable remedial
measures is a sad defect.” _

Dr. Tyson declared that the dis-
cussion this season will be con-
cerned with planning an unemploy-
ment reserve to take the place of
charity.
Senator Wagner's bill, providing for
a standard of operation entitling the
state" to a federal subsidy, would be
passed at either this session of Con-
gress or the next.

Summer Job Outlook
Bright, Says Williams

Despite the poor Christmas sea-
son for student employment, the
outlook for the summer season is
bright, according to E. B. Williams,
of the employment bureau. A num-
ber of good sales jobs for the sum-
mer have already come in.

Two unique requests were recent-
ly ﬁled in Mr. Williams’ oﬁice. One
was for a voice culturist, a student
who could give vocal lessons; the
other was for a student to read and
take short walks with an aged man
who is losing his eyesight. Both
positions were soon ﬁlled. However,
Mr. Williams is still searching for
a student who can give banjo les-
sons.

He stressed the point that

In the Pitt Weekly of January 16,‘Lt. _ Col. Cullen, Commandant of the Pitt R. O. T. C.
unit, expressed his views of the military education system as conducted at the University.
The observations. of the Colonel have elicited considerable student comment and the following ‘
letters in opposition to his views have been received by the Weekly.

Another Objector

To the Editor of the Pitt Weekly:
_I was quite interested in the ar-
ticle by Lt. Col. Cullen which ex-
plained that the best way to stop
war is to give everyone a gun.
‘ In my two years in Colonel Cul-
ien’s military department, I got im-
Dzjessioiis which led me to agree
with him on some points of his ar-
ticle, and to disagree on others. I
am in accord with the Colonel when
he says that a student cannot learn
much in a college R. O. T. C. course;
in fact, I think that I could have
earned more about warfare in two
geeks at 9' camp than in all the
t1m_e _ I was enrolled in military
raining at the University. ‘
The student interest in R, 0, T_
0- W°1'k may be increasing, but in
the College of the City of New York
last year the school_ administration
was forced to abolish compulsory
1°11‘?-1111118’ by 3} E13501‘ student u
eaval. I notice also that it is still
necessary to give money bribes from
the War Department to get student,
to take the advanced courses.
1 Suppose that Col. Cullen is en-
tirely honest in stating that he op-
poses war. disagree with his
method of avoiding it. ‘ »
No nation in the history of thg
world has ever kept out of war-by
building up its armaments. Ger.
many had in 1914 the most power.
ful war machine ever put together,
the model on which many American
oiﬁcers would like our own army de.
signed. Did it bring peace and prog.
perity to Germany? .
If the United States goes to war
and Col. Cullen. would have us
ready, so that it would be unneces-
sary to reconsider before sending an
ultimatum, the military caste will

prestige, as in 1917. The expansion
of the _army will confer automatic
promotion in rank’ and increase in

officers.
I wonder if these -facts ever in-
ﬂuence the attitude of army oﬂicers

ed on preparation for war.

Traclzmen Start Practice
For West Virginia Games

@

The indoor season for Coach
Frank Shea's track and ﬁeld team is
nearing its official openiifg. It is
scheduled for the evening of Sat-
urday, February 14, three weeks

hence, when a full team will be en-
tered in the West Virginia Invita-
tion games at the Mountaineers

huge ﬁeldhouse at Morgantown. It
is Shea’: custom to take as many as
twenty men to this meet.
Hard training during the past two
- weeks of practice has put. more than
7 I one runner in ﬁne condition for the
‘ indoor season. Managers Charley
" , Lipson and Herb Buchman report
 . that spirit and earnestness are out-
 standing characteristics of this
T . year-’s candidates. A large Crowd °f
athletes packs the track house every
afternoon from 3 to 5 o’clock.

Utterback Broad-Jumps

At present, however, the doing‘ 01

 are of most interest. Utterbaqk W111

‘ giate-broad jump championship in
New York March 7, and it is pos-
sible that he will compete in other
indoor games in the metropolitan
district, starting February 7.
course he will be with the team at
Morgantown a week later.
Utterback holds the collegiate in-
‘ door record in the broad leap with
a. mark of 28 feet, 51/.» inches, set
last year.‘ ,
, Concerning the mile-re1ay; 33
A 1 least ten men are to be considered
as possibilities for the four-man
team. ‘The leading candidates at
present are Woody Harris, Bill
, Miller, Jerry Vitulla, and Len _Mon-
heim, any one of whom can c-lip off
a 440-yard dash in 50 seconds.

Strong Reserves

Others who are reliable men at
" the quarter-mile distance are Jim
Watkins, crack half-miler; .Bamey
Holtzman, Theodore Tapp and John
Reilly, all being performers from
last year’s frosh squad. Holtzma:-n
and Reilly are expected to be In
uniform after semestei-“‘ examina-
tions. Uttecrback and Marshall
Lewis, a star hurdler who will again
be eligible this year, are others who
can be relied on to run a leg for the
relay when needed.

If a good showing is made at the
Morgantown meet, February 14, the
relay men may rate a _number of
trips this car. Competition in the
intercollegiiates in March is a pop-

~ sibility, and nokloubt they will again
run at Columbus and Philadelphia
for the Ohio and Penn Relays dur-
in the outdoor season. _

e Illinois Relays at Chicago,
March 21, and the Cleveland_A. C.
meet, March 14, are other impor-
tant dates of the indoor season. The
annual dual meet between West Vir-
ginia and Pitt on the indoor boards
at Morgantown is still _in the ten-
tative stages. Some Friday or Sat-
urday late in March is being con-
sidered. ‘.

Coach

 

After many postponements, the
University's much-discussed rifle
range has at last been completed.
To date, fifty enterprising students
have signed up for tryouts. The
eliminations andthe coaching of the
team is under the direction of Lieu-
tenant Cole and Sergeant Gunter of
the regular army, in charge of the
R. 0. T. C. at Pitt.

The shooters will ﬁre from an en-
closed ﬁring house at the targets
which are suspended above a trench,
and illuminated by hidden flood-
lights. The range diifers from the
usual type, as the targets are ﬁxed
upon pulleys and can be changed
without leaving the shooting house.
Ten tar ets have been installed, and
they wil be ﬁred upon from a dis-
tance of ﬁfty feet. A .22 calibre
riﬂe will be used in all eliminations
and matches. .

Elimination Tests

In the eliminations, each candi-

date will iire ﬁve shots at a one
bl111’S-eye target from all three po-
sitions, standing, kneeling, and
prone. In the meets,-each marks-
man will ﬁre ten shots froma prone,
kneeling and standing position at a
ﬁve bull’s-eye target, the old six
bull’s~eye target having been abol-
ished .by the National Rifle Asso-
. ciation.
_ The riﬂe team has been entered
in the Pennsylvania, West Virginia
and Ohio Intercollegiate Riﬂe
~ League- In addition to Pitt in this
league are Drexel Institute, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, Penn State.
Carnegie Tech, University of West
Virginia, University of Cincinnati,
and Fenn College of Cleveland.
Other matches with nearby schools
are being arranged, and a deﬁnite
schedule is expected to be an-
nounced later.

The Panthers were razzed by the Mountaineer fans in their game
at the_ stadium _vilion last Saturday and the Tartan fans also took
exception to the itt brand of play when the two teams met at the Tech
gym Wednesday evening.

Elayers of refusing to try to

like to see action throughout the

o

The Pitt players. however, are not the only men on the ﬂoor
who are razzed by the fans. Referees and um ires found very
little peace while officiating at these games. This condition is
due to the ignorance on the part of the spectators of the rules
which govern a game.

Fans have yet to learn that when a player dribbles directly
into a player of the opposing team, the dribbler is committing a
foul called charging. And when a dribbler loses control of a ball
while dribbling and -then recovers it after it has bounced a few
times but has not been touched by any.other man on the ﬂoor,
the player is charged with double dribbling and the ball is given
to his opponents out of bounds.

Another branch of etiquette of which Pittsburgh ﬂoor fans are
guilty is that of booing and hissing when a player on the opposition is
shooting a foul. This lamentable situation has been apparent at every
Pitt game this year, and it has always been true at the Tartans’ home
ames. '

ungentlemanly conduci Uiisportsmanship ‘on the part of spectators does

Watkins Runs
In New York

Tra. ck Half-Miler E nter a
Gotham Meet Tomorrow

: Competition is about to begin for
one member of Coach Frank Shea’s
track aggregation. Tomorrow Jim
Watkins, crack half-miler, will rep-
resent the district in the Brooklyn
College games in New York, com-

peting in the 1000-yards run. Such
a race should turn into a dash, so
fast will be the competition. Wat-
kins will run against the cream of
the nation's distance stars.

Ray Conger of Illinois A. C., na-
tional mile champion, will be out to
take nothing less than first place in
this feature run. Leo Lermond, an-
other star performer on the indoor
boards, year in and year out; Fred
Veit, New York A. C. athlete, and
Gene Venzke, national junior 1,000-
yard champion, will also be racing
with Watkins.

Races Venzke Again

Watkins will have an old score to
settle with Venzke tomorrow, for
the Swedish trackster beat him last
winter in the A. A. U. indoor cham-
pionships at Detroit. Watkins is
one of the leading half-milers and
milers of the Pittsburgh district,
having been titleholder in the short-
or distance during 1929. He regu-
larly turns in a 2:00 or 2:02 race
at the distance.

Last Saturday, he was clocked in
a 1,000-yard race against time at
less than 2:20. The watch was held
on him at the Westin house club
indoor track in East Li rty. Jim
will not be a varsity man until the
end of the present semesfer, but
starting in February he will be eli-

ible to run in dual and intercol-
egiate meets. His hard training of
the past few weeks“ has him in shape
to meet and show well against the
best Gotham can offer. We’re wish-
ing Jim luck tomorrow.

Tech Plebes Trounce
Pitt _ F rosh, 39-30

The Pitt frosh dropped their sec-
ond game in almost three years of
play when they fought a losing
ﬁght against a ﬁne team of Car-
negie Tech plebes last’ Wednesday
at the Tech gym. The ﬁnal score
was 39 to 30. F

A trio of plebes were too much
for the erratic play of the frosh.
Jagnow, Silvermanand Roudabaugb
of the Plaid yearlings each" sank
three baskets. Silverman dropped
in seven out of eight fouls.

Outstanding for Pitt were Och-
senhirt, McCamant and McBride.
McBride subbed for Hughes early in
the first half and helped keep the
young Panthers within striking dis-
tance of their rivals. The men of
Kowallis, however, trailed 19 to to
10 at the end of the half and were
unable to cut down this margin in
the last two periods of play.

Cub Cagers Defeat West Va.,
Uniontown Teams

Strengthened by the return of
Don Macamant, ailing captain who
was ill during the early part of the
season, and the addition of Charley

Pryde, a freshman in the pharmacy
school, the Pitt freshman basketball

team copped its two games during ,

the past week when they defeated
the Uniontown Junior College team
Thursday night, 29-13, and the West
Virginia. freshman team Saturday
night, 23-14. _

Coach George Kowallis presented
a revamped lineulpl for these games:
Pryde and Tom unt, who warmed
the bench heretofore, played the
forward positions; Russ Ochsenhirt
was shifted from guard to center,
and Don Macamant and Hughes
played at the guard posts.

Ochscnhirt Stars

This team played in great slgi/'70
against the Uniontown aggregation
the passing and the all-around team-
work of the boys being excellent.
Ochsenhirt led the scorers in thls
game with three ﬁeld goals and two
fouls to his credit. Each of the
other four regulars scored two field
goals apiece. _

The game with the Mountaineei
first-year men was a more evenly
fought affair. The score see-sawed
back and forward during the first
ha‘f with neither team able to gain
a lead of more than three pomtsoaf
any time, and the half _ended with
the teams tied at 11 points.

During the second half, ‘the su-

F you want to know the Dart-

watch him as he loads his pipe be-

stroll: along Wheelock Street and
pulls the familiar blue tin of Edge-

A pipe and Edgewortli-—tliis is
the smoking combination that has

Cornell, Michigan, Stanford, Illi-

Natural merit has made Edgeworth
the favorite smoking tobacco in
America's leading colleges and unt-

College men everywhere respond
to the appeal of pipes packed with
cool, slow-burning Edgeworth. Be
guided by their choice; try Edge-

Hope Speaks
On Aristotle

Addresses Social 5 c i e n c 4:
Seminar On Reasoning

“For Aristotle, existence in gen-
eral and the life of man in particu-
lar, rest upon a physical basis, but

d tend towards an ideal completion.

Thus nature is viewed as a process
of development which eventuates in
the reason,” declared Dr. Richard
Hope, associate professor of phi-
losophy, in an address delivered be-
fore the Social Science Seminar on
“ ‘The Reasoning’ in Aristotle's De
Anima.” An abstract of the ad-
dress follows:

“Reasoning is furthermore re-
garded as the natural culmination
of life no less than nature, includ-
ing what we do as biological organ-
isms and what we say as rational
animals. Reasoning is therefore a
natural, biological and logical fact.

VArnong the terms employed by
Aristotle for reasoning are such as
have been taken from lower proc-
esses, such as speech and sight. The
latter especially grow out of Aris-
totle’s advocacy of the spectator at-
titude in knowledge, according to
which an intellectual would view
the universe and life as a spectator
in the theatre. -

Reasoning Ideal '

“All these modes of speech imply
that reasoning originates in the im-
pinging of the material world upon
the bodies of rational beings, but is
itself an ideal fulﬁllment of the
physical. ' ~ ’

“The physical and biological ori-

gin and the logical and terminal‘-

character of the reason imply that
nature and man, rooted though they
are in the physical, realize their
destinies in the realm of the ideal,
and that logic can be subordinated
to life only because life is subordi-
nate to logic.”

Former Pitt Students
Studying At Prague

 

 

Two students who attended the
University last year, John and
Milada Marsalka, are now studying
at the University of Prague, Re-
public of Czechoslovakia, where a
small group of Americans are con-
tinuing their education.

Although studying in a foreign
university, the students still ob-
serve American customs and holi-
days. They celebrated Thanksgiv-
ing at the Hotel Beranek with the
traditional turkey dinner.

The students hold regular monthly
meetings with their Czechoslovakian
colleagues. Milada Marsalka of
Pittsburgh is chairman of the body,
and Paul Ursen, also of Pittsburgh,
is treasurer.

Fitzgerald, Kidd Talk At
Delta Mu Delta Dinner

Two nationally known ﬁgures in
the ﬁelds of transportation and eco-
nomics, Mr. John M. Fitzgerald of
Eastern Presidents’ Conference and
Dr. Howard C.- Kidd, university pro!
fessor of commerce, spoke at an in-
formal dinner held by Delta Mu
Delta, honorary scholastic frater-
nity of the Downtown Division, in
the Dutch Room of the Fort Pitt
hotel last week.

Mr. Lloyd Mahoney, Instructor of
Finance, was chairman of the af-
fair and Mr. Robert Avars, Profes-
sor of Accounting, acted as toast-
master for the evening. Dr. ‘Vincent
W. Lanfear, Director of the Down-
town Division, welcomed the fra-
ternity and its guests.

“Why Railroads?”‘
In his talk, Mr. Fitzgerald dis-

cussed “Why Railroads?” bringing.

out the fact that the American rail-
roads are our largest employers of
labor and the greatest consumers
of the products of other industry.
The Government needs our great
railroad system as the nat.ion’s
largest corporate taxpayer. Railway
taxes aggregate more than one mil-
lion dollars daily.

However, the popular question to-
day is: “What is the matter with
Intelligent consid-
eration of this inquiry suggests an-
other question: “Do we really need
our railways?” The railways con-
tinue to handle the great bulk of

_the nation’s freight traffic with

great efficiency. They have served
as a national relief agency and have
always recognized their obligation to
the public. In addition they have
responded to every governmental
request for relief in emergencies.

_ “Railroad Strategy” was the sub-
ject discussed by Dr. Kidd. He
maintains that the ﬁeld of business
education is advancing greatly and
that stress is now laid on thinking
power. The greater part of his
speech dealtwith railroad consolida-
tion and diplomacy.

Mr. John M. Fitzgerald and Mr.
Theodore A. Siedle, secretary of the
Downtown Division and Instructor
in vocational education were initi-
ated as honorary members.

Russian Room To

Reflect Peasant’s Art  

 

The‘ Russian Room on the Com-
mons Room ﬂoor of the Cathedral
will reﬂect the typical features of
the national art of old Russia, par-
ticularly the peasant art of the

sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The plans which were drawn by
Dr. Andrey Avinoif, director of the
ﬁne arts department of Carnegie’
Institute and instructor in the ﬁne
arts department of the University,
are now completed. Work on some
parts of the furniture has already
begun with the help of the Russian
wood carvers residing in Pitts-
burgh. For many centuries wood
carving of every descri tion has
been popular in the no em prov-
inces of Russia where forests are
abundant.

With simple tools the Russian
craftsmen fashioned ob'ects of the
household and decorate parts of
his dwelling and furniture in keep-
ing with the ancient tradition of mo-
tives and styles. In the years pre-
ceding the war, remarkable publica-
tions were issuedwhich made ac-
cessible to the student of art numer-
ous and notable examples of native
carved wood, as preserved in pub-
lie and private collections. The
decoration and furniture of the Rus-
sian room were planned in accord-
dance with these sources of infor-
mation.

The ‘chairs and benches will be
carved with cross-like openings
which are characteristic of furniture
and fences in the northern prov-
inces of Russia. Since genuine old
Russian chairs and benches usually
had perpendicular backs and were
not particularly comfortable, the

Employment Bureau
Has Two Alumni J qbs

The University employment -, bu-
reau reports two positions avail-
able in the technical division of a
large oi-l company,

The ﬁrst requires ﬁve years -1 of
mechanical engineering experience
in a steel mill. Power or mainte-
nance .experience would be partic-
ularly desirable. The applicants
must be between thirty-three and
forty years of age and must pos-
sess J. thorough knowledge of the
lubrication of modern steel millimet-
chin-etry. This position is in West-
ern Pennsylvania and pays approxi-
mately $4,500 per year.

The second position is similar ex-
cept that the steel mill experience
is not required. Power plant ex-
perience would be desirable. This
position calls for a man between the
ages of thirty~two and thirty-eight
and pays approximately $3,600» per
year. It is also in Western Penn-
sylvania.

 

If further information concerning’ . '

either of these openings is desired
see_ Lester H. Perry, Room 7, Stu-
dent. Activities building.

backs of the chairs for the class-
room are being changed slightly, giv-
ing them a slight curve.

The professor’s table will have
an inclined top like those used for
reading the Scriptures in the Rus-
sian churches. The conference ta-
ble for the students will be of solid,
simple workmanship, following ex-
amples of woodwork in northern and
central districts of Russia. In one
of the corners of the rooms will be
placed a cupboard which will be
adorned by images in colors of the
sirin and the alcanost, the legendary
birds with the heads of women. A
small carved table will bear an ar-
chaic geometrical decoration found
in various regions of Russia. All
furniture is to be of massive oak.

The blackboard on the wall will
be shaped as a triptych, the re-
yerse of the two wings being carved
in a manner similar to that used on
the professor’s armchair. On one of
the walls will be hung an embroid-
cry in the_ polychrome style of an-
cient Russia, portraying a tradition-
al Russian bogatyr, one of the pop-
ular heroes of the folksongs of the
Vladimir cycle created in the “Holy
Russia” of past ages and still lin-
gering in the minds of the people.

Students of Russian birth or de-
scent who_have become adopted citi-
zens of this country will feel in this
room the spirit of national tradi-
tions which will help them to appre-
ciate the cultural background of
their people in the old land. And
young Pittsburghers of other na-
tional stocks will, on entering it,
sense the_ contribution made toeour
Joint heritage by those who have
come to us out of distant Russia.

“Eight ' Ball In The Side
Pocket” Can Now Be
Heard At Activities’

 

Frequernters of Activities build-
ing, who were lately appalled at
the loss of card playing privileges,
had their hearts gladdened this
week when they gazed upon a
regular billiard table brought
there from the Faculty Club, now
being dismantled, through the ef-
forts of the dean of men’s office.

The table will be under the su-
pervision of the university Y. M.
C. A. To eliminate student mo-
nopoly in playing and to furnish
a means for unkeep and repairs,
a fee of 40c per hour will be
charged. , The cuesticks and pool-
balls will be kept in the Y. M. C.
A. office and strict watch for any
abuses of privileges will be ob-
served.

Shouli the fee prove too ex-
cessive, during a trial_period, it
will be reduced, according to the

dean of men’s office.

In New Play

Sober Brandishes Sword For
Beauty and Booty

“Captain Applejack” may wave
a beer bottle aloft when he leads
the pirate crew in that bloody
chanty, “Fifteen men on a dead
man's chest; Yo-ho, and a bottle of
rum” in the second act of the Pitt
Players’ production which will be
presented February 19 at the Y. M.
and Y. W. H. A. auditorium. This
role is being played by Clarence
Sober, Dent. ‘31.

In the second act, the pirate ship
will be the setting. Against a back-
ground of ﬂashing swords and bran-
dished pistols, the valorous captain
must defend his gold and the cap-
tive woman (who, by the way, is
Barbara Ann Hartman, Col. ’33),
from his mutinous crew. The crew
and the captain cut cards for the
treasure and the lady, and the au-
dience is given two guesses as to
who wins.

Another reason why the second
act is interesting is that Elaine
Blauvelt, Col. ’34, plays the part of
the cabin boy.

“I think this is an excellent one,
because it has all the elements usu-
ally lacking in plays of today,” said
Carl N. Cass, when questioned about
the merits of “Captain Applejack.”
“It has an element of make-believe
and romance; strictly speaking, it is
more of a. play than most modern
stage presentations.”

The play was sub-titled “An Ara-
bian Night’s Adventure in Three
Acts” by the playwright, Walter
Hatchett.

Tickets for "Captain Applejack”
will be sold in the hallway of Alum-
ni Hall for several days before the
night of the play. And if you want
to ‘capture a little of the fun and
frolic of a pirate ship buy a ticket.

Chinese Student Life.
Subject For Tea Talk

A lecture on “Student Life in
China,” by Dr. James Henry, for-
merly president of Canton Chris-
tian College, now Lingnan Univer-
sity, the presentation of a Hunga-

rian etching by Mr. Mihok, presi-
dent of the Hungarian Student Club,
and negro spirituals by the Tuske-
gee Institute quartet featured the
International Tea held at the
Heinz House last Wednesday after-
noon. The program was arranged
by the World’s Fellowship Commit-
tee of the University Y. M. C. A.

Dr. Henry expressed the interest
the Chinese student evidenced in pol-
itics and social enterprises. The
Lingnan University .has instituted
student government, and the stu-
dents show vital interest in its un-
dertakings. The etching oresented
by Mr. Mihok was given by the Hun-
garian students of the American col-
leges in appreciation of the help
rendered the Hungarian students
stranded after the war.

 

 

Apples And More Apples 0 1- j

Promise Pi tti tes Health

Don’t let anyone -kid you, times
are tough! At practically every
downtown corner, you can see men
selling apples. Even midgets are
selling crab apples. Three apple
vendors patrol the Pitt campus, and
inveigle the unsuspecting students
into parting with their nickles for
the pleasure of biting into a big,
luscious, red apple.

Lewis Marcus, colored, is sta-
tioned in front of Mellon Institute.
He had been living a life of leisure
for the past year, not being able to
get any kind of work. He reports
that his business is “in the red.” He
believes that Pit‘. students should
eat more apples, because not only
“will” an apple a day keep the doctor
away,” but if you purchase a; ples,
you help keep the wolf away ‘from
his door. However, we forgot to
mention to him that even doctors
mi.:t live.

At the lower end of the Univer-
sity Drive you can ﬁnd John Rus-

apples and tangerines to the student
body. John is very optimistic, be-

C e n t e r Students Practicing
For Annual Play Night

 

 

By I SADORE GREENBERG

Johnstown Center:—An epidemic
of picture-taking hit the Center
and the features of the members of
the following groups were recorded
for the 1931 Owl; the faculty, stu-
dent council, girls’ hockey team, col-
lege players and the staff of the
Panther Club. '

The Pitkin club is becoming one
of the most active groups in_ the
school. Regular weekly dinner
meetings are held, for which pronu-
nent speakers are secured. V-

The college players are rehearsing
diligently the three one-act plays
chosen for presentation at the
fourth annual Play Night, sched-
uled for early February. This
group is expanding its activities
this year, studying the contempor-
ary drama under Mr. Crouch and
holding dances and tea parties.

The Men’s Glee Club is tuning up
atweekly practice sessions in prep-
aration for the appearances which
Manager.Joe Brittain is lining up.
A call has been issued for orchestra
tryouts but thus far the turn-out
has been discouraging.

PROF. MILLER SPEAKS

Professor John K. Miller, of the

cause business is good. He sells
about two boxes of apples daily,
and plenty of tangerines, too, He
used to sell scales and registers for
a Register Company. “These col.

with Herb Dent buying two apples
just then, we can't blame the gentle-
man for his attitude.

He used to work for a coal company,
but hasn’t worked anywhere for the
last three months. When we asked
him what he thought of colleg stu-
dents, he hesitated. “W ‘.1’. he
drawled, “some of them are find and

Abe, because his business is on the

In addition to considering sug-
gestions for favors, the committee
has adopted a plan of competition
between batteries for the sale of
tickets. An excellence guidon will
be presented annually by Scabbard
and Blade, starting this year, to the
best rated battery; and the unit
selling the most ball tickets will be
granted ﬁfty per cent toward the
winning of the standard. The com-
Inittee feels certain that this ar-
rangement will prove to be an in-
centive to the members of the bat-
teries for the ‘sale of tickets. Tickets

are now being printed.
