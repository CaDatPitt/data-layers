Dr. F reehof Lectures
Before Inquiry Forum

Local Rabbi, Author Speaks Before Discussion Group
On Present Day Inﬂuence Of Religion As Agent
For Building Character, Unity Of Mankind

 

By John Martinco

In “a world like this,” the function
of religion is to rebuild both the
human character and the unity of all
mankind, Dr. Solomon B. Freehof as-
serted at Inquiry Forum, Monday.

Dr. Freehof, noted author and rabbi
at Rodef - Shalom Temple, declared
that “no government or economic
machine will work unless there is
character in the machinists.”

“Religion,” he added, “is the only
functioning body in the world dedi-
cated to adult education. It is the
duty, debt and obligation of religion
in a world like this to build courage,
reconstruct hope, and turn the face of
man to_the rising sun.” .

Comparing the present with the
Victorian age, Dr. Freehof declared
that we have lost that “deep-rooted
belief in human progress” and have
passed out of the “magniﬁcent cre-

ativeness” that characterized the
earlier age. Each succeeding genera-
tion must take steps in advance of its
predecessor, he said.

He averred that the principle of
progress through education has been
greatly discredited by recent events.
Education has given new techniques
for cunning dictators to use in propa-
ganda. I

“Education has been used,” he con-
tinued, “with appalling success as an
instrument to stultify and shackle
the mind of man.”

In the same way, faith in science
has been lost because “scientiﬁc
knowledge and skill have been de-
voted by the modern government to
the task of casting terror over the
hearts of men.” 4 '

Likewise, faith in government as
an arbiter of- justice, has been com-
pletely altered by today’s more

Of State Schools

Glee Club
Continues
Tradition

Concert Scheduled Friday
Night Recalls Anecdote
To Former Dean

Glee Club tradition. is carried on
again this week with the group’s
rmnual home concert. The male chor-

isiers comprising the oldest non-
athletic activity on cam pus, are
themselves a tradition around the

University: this FrEda_v’s concert.
starting at 8:30 o’clock in Carnegie
Music Hall, is their -'l'Ti..l1.

Part of that tradition is illustrated
by Walter J. Rome, former assistant.
dean of men and present head of the
juvenile detention home of Allegheny
County.

“About ion years ago,’ Rome re-
calls, “t,la~:‘ club had listed one of the
Univers‘*.._v cheerleaders on its roll.
The bo:.'.~‘- used to make a lot of trips
to small mining towns in western
Peni1syl2:a,tﬁ;=. in those days. One day
when fin? bus got into town, a crowd
of miners surrounded it.

Introduce Traditional Songs

“The fellows boosted the six—foo‘.
cheerleader on to the bus top, where
he led them in the yell, ‘Back to the
mines, boys. There’ll be no strike

7

today.’ ”
They’ve chortled this at every
small town stop since. And then

there was the story of the tenor who
was persuaded, in a frolicki.ng mo-
ment, to try to jump the lake when
the club was at Erie. He landed
within four feet--on this side.

Tradition from another angle: The
famous “Battle Song” and “Panther
Song” of the University have for the
first time been arranged for a male
chorus. They will be a yearly home
concert feature. Other new features
this year will be the singing of two
ﬁnal numbers —“Praycr of Thanks-
giving" and “Hail to 1"itt”—----by the
combined undergraduate and alumni
group of ‘.300 voices. Three popular
Stephen C. Foster melodies will also
be presents-.d..

.A_l.most all of the tickets for l:l1i..~’
year’s concert; have been sold. The
few remaining tickets, however, will
be offered to students at the ticket
excliange in front of Room 801.

it."

In an attempt to give every woman
at the University a better under-
standing of the qualiﬁcations of an
efficient homemaker, the Vocational

budgeting of the family income, and
food planning are a few of the many
subjects to be considered. The dates
for the meetings have been set for

' April 5, 6, 7, and will be held at Heinz

Since January, the Vocational Con-

‘ ference sponsored by Miss McLaugh-
A‘ lin has dealt with many problems fac-

Chief Connors Addresses
John, Marshall Tonight

By Bob Leon
Detective Peter A. Connors, Chief
of the County Detective Bureau, will
address the John Marshall Club, hon-
orary pre-legal fraternity, tonight at
8 o’clock in Room 817, Cathedral.
Detective Connors, who was ap-
pointed to his position last June after
18 years oii the city police force,

DETECTIVE CONNORS

thinks that law students can beneﬁt
by personal contact with those who
are engaged in the processes of the
law.

He plans to discuss three points of
interest to legal students. The first of
‘these is the “Modus Operendi” of
the law; or, how a case proceeds from
the point where the suspect is picked
up, to the conviction or acquittal.

The second point will deal with the
science of crinie-solving and the part
played in detection by ﬁngerprints,
ballistic reports, and wax molds.

Chief Connors’ third point will deal
with the attitude that young lawyers
should take towards the police, and
what pitfalls to avoid.

Mr. Connors says, “The greatest
handicap to the police today is the
diﬂiculty of obtaining convictions,
even in open and shut cases, due to
ignorant and prejudiced jurors op-
erating under. the present law which
requires a unanimous’ vote ‘to reach
a decision.” He suggested as a possi-
ble remedy “that all cases other than
homicide require a 7 to 5 jury vote.”

If any‘-‘ athlete-.may be deﬁned as

percent of their shots at the hoop. But
while they do not conform to the Pres-

:  ent-day American standard of ath-

At one time, athletes were those

this is obviously untrue, for the facili-

there is a demand for that increase.
And admittedly there is lack of this
demand. V  V
Occasional Athletics
, Possibly the attitude of thestudeiit
today is not-in liaimoiiy with sport
for sport’s sake. He may play an
occasional game of ping pong, or go
bowling when the spirit moves, but
his desire for physical competition
has apparently decayed somewhere
along the line. This may be the case.
But there is still another possi-
bility: that the student today is
physicallyand mentally lazy, that

-he has lost his drive. That is, the . ~'

university student today continu-
ally seeks the easy way out: if it
is easier to sit in the stands and
get the thrill of watching the team
in action, rather than to go down '
on the field and take part in the
actual playing of the game, the
average student will sit in the
stands. If one goes on the premise
that physical activity of any sort
must be preceded .by some mental
activity, then it must be concluded
that the mental activity is lacking
as well. J . .
Recordings .

It is with hesitation that this fact
is accepted as true. .It is extremely
diﬂicul-t to condemn the college stu-
dent of today as lazy. Yet, let’s look
at the record.

At the University, for example,
intramural athletic competition of
one sort or another is in progress

continually. Practically every ﬁeld.

of sports has its representative/ on
Pi'tt’s athletic program. And yet,
outside of fraternity matches, intra-
mural athletics has reached a point
of stagnation. The same small group
of students which forms_ an independ-
ent touch football team will get ‘to-
gether aubasketball squad and later
a softball team; although quite "a
number of teams are entered in prac-
tically every sport, the actual number
of students in intramural sports is
extremely small. And even in the
fraternity leagues the greatest possi-
ble number of players is approxi-
mately 600, a figurewhich in actu-
ality is about 60 per cent higher than
the true numbert

Anemia

It is obvious then, that the percent-
age of that participation is low. It
is a sad solution to say “that this
is a consequence of laziness on the
part of, the student body, sad be-

cause laziness ranks with anemia '_ "
and leprosyas the most incurable ‘

of‘ maladies. .. V

The only alternative is that tlief

student lacks education on the sub-
ject. -Perhaps there are a great num-
ber of students who havenft even
heard of intraniural athletics. If it’s
been lack of publicity, then maybe
the student isn’t lazy at all. If it’s
been lack‘ of adequate supervision,
maybe all the student needs is a

, chance. But if ,-it’s laziness, then=_

maybe we'd better give it up as a
bad job. 5 .-
