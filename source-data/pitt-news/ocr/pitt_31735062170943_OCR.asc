Pill Excludes Blue-Collar Families

by LARRY PANSINO

Statistics compiled by the Of-
fice of Institutional Research here
at Pitt show that because of tui-
tion hikes the University is be-
coming too expensive for students
from blue-collar families.

The statistics show that the per-
centage of students from blue-
collar families has been fa-lling
sharply since 1969, while total en-
rollment has remained stable.

The blue-collar enrollment de-
cline directly parallels a steady
rise in tuition since Pitt became
state-related in 1966. The median
family income of Pitt students
has also risen with the tuition.

New Traffic

In 1969. this median family in-
come was $10*.600. compared
with a median income of $8.309
for Pennsylvania non-farm la-
borers, according to the 1970 cen-
sus of population report.

In 1966, the first year of Penn-
sylvania subsidization of the Uni-
versity. the. tuition for state resi-
dents for two terms was $460. The
statistics show the median income
for students’ families then was
$9,000. and 43 per cent of the
freshmen belonged to blue-collar
families. By 1969. that figure had
risen to 53 per cent. despite rises
in tuition to $700 per year and
median family income to $9.800.

Summonses

Included «in Law Suit  

by N. J. BROWN

The suit pending against Traffic Court progressed at a ‘meeting
Friday between plaintiff Bob Byer and Assistant City Solicitor Daniel

Curtin, defense attorney.

Byer filed a class action suit Jan. 15 against the Mayor, City Mag-

istrates. Cashier of Traffic Court. and the Chief Clerk of City Court to '

stop the current proceedings concerning non-moving traffic violations.
Byer states that present procedures systematically and deliberately
deny rights to citizens, so the city can make money.

Byer, who is representing himself in the case, said Curtin agreed
to several amendments to the original complaint. The new Traffic
Court forms, under Magistrate Louis Dadowski’s name, will be in-
cluded in the suit, and several persons who have received these forms

will be added as plaintiffs.

"-It is still a formal criminal charge. brought in the name of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania instead of the City." Byer contends.
He feels the City will say it is a civil charge because the ‘parking or-
dinances are used as a revenue-making operation and the metermaids

are under the Treasurer’s office.

“But under the law,” says Byer, “you can be arrested, fined,
and there is the stated possibility of imprisonment. This makes it a

criminal charge.”

One of several Pitt students involved in the suit. Byer insists
that the present Traffic Court system utilizes illegal criminal proce-
dures. The 14th Amendment guaranteeing due process. includes tin-
Sixth Amendment right to confront one's accuser. and also the pre-
sumption of innocence until guilt is prov.ed. These are rarely. if ever.
honored under the present system. Byer said.

The summons and information procedures also aren‘t under a law-
ful issuing authority, such as a magistrate. but rather a computer. he

continued.

Both Byer and plaintiff Barb Jennings have received notices of is-
suance of arrest warrants on parking violations, contrary to Judge

Weir’s _preliminary injunction.

"I think the issuance of these arrest warrants is signiﬁcant."
B_ver said. "It again shows that criminal processes in Traffic Court
are totally out of the control of a lawful, issuing authority. but rather
under the control of clerical employees and computers.

But when cost of a Pitt educa-
tion continued to rise in the ’70s,
percentage of blue-collar family
freshmen dropped to 41 per cent
in 1972, the lowest figure since
the University was private. Last
year tuition reached $970, with
the family income middle figure
up to $11,700, the highest on rec-
ord, reports Institutional Re-
search.

Tuition increases probably were
not the only factor attributable to
the blue-collar enrollment drops.
Since the total number of stu-
dents has leveled off. a counter-

 ing trend to college educations for

most graduating high school sen-
iors seem to have taken hold.

Bad job opportunities in recent
years for college graduates.
coupled with the increased costs
of an education may have tarn-
ished much of the glitter of col-
lege that attracted a majority of
high schoolers to campuses in the
'60s.

Re-organization discussed

Socialist Alliance Meets

by MARK ISKOVITZ

The Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA) held an open meeting at the
UACM Friday. March 23.

Paul Leblanc. as local YSA .ead—
er. spoke about the YSA and ad-
mitted that the local group is sti‘ll
small and in the formative
stages. He maintained that this
gave potential members “an op-
portunity to get in on the ground
floor" and help build the local
group. '

Leblanc sees a “very different
atmosphere in this country today

. . a whole new ball game.” He
believes that the situation is not
much more “positive for‘ the
movement.”

Nancy Brown. National Com-
mittee member of YSA. said that
"the majority" of eligible young
people did not even vote in the
last election because they were
"disillusioned" with the political
system. She felt that there was
"deepening radicalization.”
‘though she admitted that “there is
no great outpouring of demon-
strations."

- All of the speakers felt that ‘

"the contradictions in the capital-
ist system are becoming more ob-
vious all of the time. causing
more people to radicalize and
work for socialism." as one‘mem—
ber put it.

Sam Rosenzweig, president of
Pitt Young Democrats, disagreed
with YSA’s analysis of the con-
temporary political climate. He
was “very optimistic” about our
present form of government, and
believes that the system has be-
come “more responsive to young
people” through the 18 year old
vote.

Rosenzweig sees student activ-

‘ism being redirected from "vio-
lence" to "normal ‘channel__s.»'.' He 
V pointed .-out ‘.=./that. 'studentsrregi_s-~

 
  
 

tered in great numbers in Alle-
gheny County for the last election.
indicating "more interest in the
system."

On the other hand. William Kil-
son. editor of the BAS News, told
the Pitt News that. like the YSA.
he saw "faith,in legitimized poli-
tical structures being wiped
away." He added. however. that
revolution "is not just around the
corner.“ I ‘ ‘

Joey Fuller, deputy chairman of
BAS, added that the radical move-
ment was broadening its base to
include more of the middle class.

Brown discussed the matter of
middle class support, pointing out
that although the minorities are
leading "the struggle against op-
pression“ at this time. the help
of the "working middle class"
will be required to win the strug-
gle.

Eureka! Science for

by JOHN DOWNING

One year ago. two young wom-
en at the University decided to
form their own student publica-
tion. “We felt that there was a
need to make science more com-
prehensible to students who ex-
press a personal interest in the
subject." said Diane Hollings-
worth. pre-med student turned
German major. ‘

So she and her roommate. Pa-
tricia Howe. took their idea to
Lois Grodstein. their Scientific
Writing instructor.

She directed them to Student Al-
locations, where they discovered
that they would have to fight
through a considerable amount of
red tape. Such a publication had

Hearn said Beckwith is an eloquent lecturer who makes his topic
enjoyable and cleareven to those who are not familiar with medieval

art.

"Only 50 years ago." said Gordon. "the 1000 years from the fall
of Rome to the Renaissance were called the Dark Ages. Today there are
a half dozen areas of specialization in fine arts dealing with this med-
ieval period. There are more artifacts from the medieval period in art

history than in any other discipline."

Another prominent art expert. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner. an author-
ity in modern architecture history from the University of London. will

to be recognized by Student Allo-
cations as a student organization.

"Unfortunately." Hollings-
worth said. "there was no meet-
ing of SA planned for the spring or
summer sessions. So we had to
wait. But we used the time to be-
gin writing and organizing.“

When the fall term of 1972 did
begin. the idea was reviewed by
Student Allocations. Hoollings-
worth and Howe and several other
students who joined the effort.
were disturbed when it was sug-
gested that they take their idea
to an existing student organiza-
tion.

They disliked this and persist-
ed with their original idea. After
they faced a formal hearing, con-
tracted a purpose for the publica-
tion, and designed a constitution,
Student Allocations did recognize
them, in November, 1972.

By December they received the
necessary funds. The first Eure-
ka, which is the name chosen for
the magazine. cost $480 to pro-

duce. It is eight and a half pages.

long and contains articles deal-
ing with research being done by
natural science professors.

One article discusses Dr. Rob-
ert Levine‘s work with "synthe-
sizing potentially new medicinals.
as well as developing better meth-
ods than are now available for
preparing well established drugs.

An article entitled “Superfluous
DNA” discusses Dr. Robert Mel-
ton’s work. He is attempting to
discover more about DNA, such
as whether or not it is completely
comprised of genes.

These articles. like the rest of
the ones contained in the first
Eureka, are short. informative.
and easy to read.

'.'We hope to expand the length

-of, Eureka to 12 pages by next

year." Hollingsworth said. "Right
now. we are still in the testing per-
iod. We want to see what the re-
action to our publication is before
we make a lot of future plans."
There has been some reaction al-
ready.

“Some people seemed frighten-
ed when they opened up the maga-
zine and found it filled with news
of the science world,” she said.
“However, "we don’t want people
to be frightened by it. ‘We design-
ed it to be read by non-science
majors and science majors
alike.”

Other people have questioned
why Eureka wasn’t longer or did-
n't seem to involve their favorite
science topics. “Trying to sort
through and refine all the incom-
ing information into a magazine
of Eureka’s size is a big task.“
Hollingsworth said. "The amount

. of research currently being done

at Pitt is staggering. We could
never run out of subject materi-
al." she added.

One of Eureka’s goals is to pro-
vide a place where students can
learn about natural sience
courses at Pitt. Also, Eureka is
simply to be a way to bring sci-
ence to students. I

Most of its writers are fresh-
men and sophomores. Its present
home base is Howe and Holling-
worth’s dormitory room. There
hasn't been any office space
available to them.

"Considering the paperwork
and manpower involved. this
makes things difficult," Hollings-
worth said. “And we encourage
anyone who is interested in help-
ing. We need a lot more people.
Eureka has been a lot of fun. .And
we want it to keep fulfilling the
need of the University. long after
we’ve graduated." V

Pitt Law

Column  And A  Half

By JOHN METCALFE

The reason this column appears on the editor-
ial page is that there is hardly ever any news in
it. For instance, by now almost everybody is aware
that the Chancellor of the University has. gone to
Harrisburg with a folder under his arin. His pur-
pose in going to I Harrisburg is to extract more

funds for the University from the various legisla-
tors who do business in Harrisburg. I wish him
well.

The Chancellor intends to inform the legisla-
tors that the University is doing all it can to
save money, and. further. that despite all our best
efforts at austerity. we cannot survive this year on
the same appropriation-.we got last year. While
the number of dollars would remain the same.

. the size of them has changed. They are smaller;

each of them will buy less of the urgent necessi-
ties’ of academic life than the dollars we have en-
joyed in the past.

The Chancellor is right. Some of my personal

dollars have dwindled to the point that I sometimes.

confuse them with nickels. As _a result 1 reguiarlx
overpay my bus fares and frequently embarrass
myself at cigarette counters.

One thing the Chancellor plans to mention is
that. as University costs rise and appropriations are
frozen, it is necessary to increase tuition. This has
been done regularly over the past few years. From
its low point of $225.00 just after the University

became state-related, tuition has risen to $485.00 _

already. and is likely to reach an even five hun-
dred dollars per term by Fall ofi this year.“ There
is a strong implication in all of this. although the
Chancellor does not actually say so. that history
may be in the process of repeating itself. The
year before Pitt went state‘-related. tuition reached

an all-time high of’ $700.00 per term. At the

same time. Pitt went out of bllSlIl€.\'.\.
' Having already failed as a private institution.
we seem to be on the point of failing as a public
one’. ’ ' ‘~

Any number of studies’ have been produced with-
in the University to show the actual effect of the
change in Pitt‘s. status and, the accompanying drop
in tuitions. After the change. total family income
of the average entering freshman dropped drama-
tically. The proportion of children of fathers in
blue-collar occupations rose sharply; the percen-
tage of new freshmen who were the first in their
respective families to attend college rose even fas-
ter.‘ '

At the same time. according to the most reli-
able indicators available. the academic quality of
incoming freshmen reached new heights. As mea-
sured by mean SAT scores and liigh-school

quintile rankings, the freshman class of 1968 was-

the most highly qualified group ever to enter Pitt.
1968* was after the change to state-relatedness
and before the recent round of tuition hikes which
are inexorably returning to the levels which near-
ly destroyed Pitt a few years ago.

I am fond of dramatic images. If you will
allow me to use the Cathedral of Learning as a
giant graph, and further agree that tuition in

1966 had reached the top. we can make an inter-
esting demonstration. We will turn the lights on
and off floor by floor to indicate our progress.

Sorry. I am too tired to run up and down the
stairs flipping switches. Itis enough to consid-
er that at one time we were down to the four-
teenth floor. and now we are back up somewhere
between the thirty-second and thirty-third. I am

' exhausted by the thought; that many steps might

have killed me.

Let us visit the new friend of the University.
the veteran, for a moment. If he is single. over

“the fourteenweeks of an ordinary trimester he

will receive seven hundred and seventy dollars
from a grateful government. He will pay $497.00
in tuition and fees. and may also be called upon

_ to purchase books. With luck he will have as much

as $250.00 per term left over for such luxuries as
rent. If he attends part-time. his stipend is cut.
This is not a solution.

Other students enjoy standards of living so_pre—
carious that an increase of even fifteen dollars a
term will remove them from academic life. When
enough students leave. the University will die. If
the students leave, the University richly deserves
to die. ' ‘

(One of the many editors of the PITT NEWS

, was both impressed and disturbed by the Chan-

cellor's proposal. It-is neatly round in spiralplas-
tic. and has a fancy dark blue cover. adorned with
the,seal of the University of Pittsburgh. The in-
side is full of graphs and charts. The editor in ques-
tion wonders how much this dandy book costs. in
a year when funds are short. and has a suggestion
for /the future. Future begging messages should be
packed in plain brown paper bags. This will con-
vey more surely than any exercise in academic
rhetoric the seriousness of the case. )

The Commonwealth claims, with some jus-
tice. that the crisis has been. provoked. not by any ~
action at the local or state levels, but by the
withdrawal of federal funds. In effect. the legis- .
lature states that we are being killed by the
President, and they may not be able to rescue us
from such deadly opposition. I will not pursue this
argument. S

Enough people have already told me that I
devote entirely too much of my time and this pa-
per‘s space attacking Richard Milhous Nixon. All
I have been doing is hollering when I am hurt.
This group of critics would probably be off'ended
if I insisted on bleeding every time I was stab-
bed. ‘

Enough of this. I hope the Chancellor comes
back from Harrisburg with a great deal of mon-
ey. I doubt that he will. More likely he will re-
turn with a little money and a big bill for each
of us to pay next year.

I am certain. however. that he will try his
best. I do not know Dr. Posva-r personally. but I
am sure that” he would rather not preside over
the second and final ‘death of the University of
Pittsburgh. That would be carrying tradition too
far.- /

SDS Support

Dear Editor.

I was deeply disturbed to dis-
cover the way in which Mr.
Schneirov. Ms. Lindsley. et. al.
had been treated by the campus
police and the University. If I
may assume Mitch Berry‘s re-
port is accurate, the students
were reprimanded. arrested and
prosecuted for "posting anti-war
signs on the doors of the Cathe-
dral of Learning.” Since when
was this commonpractice greet-

ed by arrest and legal proceed- ‘

ings?

In the late-1960‘s, people in-
clined as Pendergest apparently
is. would have beenydenied em-
ploynienton a university campus.
Students would have denied Pen-
degest that privilege. It seems un-
likely. however. that any response
will be generated today. This is

the saddest of charges which I

level at my university and my fel-
low .\tll(l_€IltS. We apparently not
even’ the most--elementary .\€l'lSe
of justice. "We have failed to be-
come conscious of .anything but
our own “personal ambition and
become anaesthetized ‘to what
really goes on around us.” ~

What about the three" victims?
Can nothing be done to control
our wildly arbitrary Prende-
gests? Groups like the SDS will
retain the courage to have con-
victions. If they can expect no
protection ‘ from other students.
this w'ill not be the last outrage
perpetrated by suppressive inter-
exts against free speech in the
University. '

Editor's Note: The following state-
ments of the tour candidates for the
Black Action Society (BAS) positions
of chairman and deputy chairman.
The elections are being held today
in the Tower's Lobby from 10 a.m.
to 8 p.m. Student ID and validation
card are required to vote.

Joe Wingfield

Collectively. the Black Action
Society has the positive power for
dealing with and solving Univer-
sity affairs pertaining to Black
students on this campus. It is my
belief that not through pacifica-
tion or liberalism will anything
concrete or beneficial be con-
structed for Black students.

The BAS should promote strong
unity among Black students here
on campus and also in the com-
munity. I feel that there is an im-
mediate need for the BAS to acti-
vate programs which are rele-
vant to the Black students. which
will channel all types of Black
students" input into the BAS. This
should bean advantage to the end
results affecting Black students.

With this understanding, the
BAS must become more coopera-
tive in all aspects of the Black
issue. This leads to what my cam-
paign format is based on.

The ways in.which I will initi-
ate affirmative action will be bas-
ed on the "Collective Work Ethic
Theory.“ Stronger Black stu-
dents‘ input from all cross—sec-
tions of students would result in
the pure physical and functional
actions which constitute the Black
Action Society.

The production end result
would be "Black Urganization
through Participation.”

William L. Kilson

During my campaign I've done
several things which I think re-
flect on the kind of BAS chairman
that I would make. First. I talked
to several Black Greek organiza-
tions to present my platform and
to get them to take an active stand
in the elections by way of endorse-
ments.

Secondly. I have been going to
individual students in their dorms
to find out what their concerns
are for BAS and to present my
platform for their comment and
criticism. I received endorse-
ments from Kappa Alpha Psi fra-
ternity and from Delta Sigma The-
ta sorority. and got very favor-
able responses from individual
Black students that I talked to.

My intentions in both of these
instances was to take myself di-
rectly to the poeple who I would
be representing if I were elected
BAS chairman. I feel that BAS
leadership must be sensitive to
and accountable to all types of
Black students at Pitt, organized
or not, “Greek” or independent.

The platform that I‘m running
on emphasizes four crucial things
that BAS must be about. The
first is to increase the quantitiy

and quality of publicity for BAS
programs and activities. Next. we
must maintain and even increase
the level of program output that
BAS has established this year. and
to gain even stronger influence at
the organized levels of Universi-
ty and student functioning.

Thirdly. BAS should actively
help students to organize around
their interests. Thus. if students
wanted to organize a dance group.
a voter registration drive. a
Black Studies majors group. or
even a Black Chess Club. BAS
would assist by providing meet-
ing rooms and other facilities.

The effect would be that BAS
would be dealing directly with the
interests of its constituency,
Black students would be organ-
ized and working together, and
there would be many more oppor-
tunities for Black students to get
involved with things that are in-
teresting and enjoyable to them.

Finally. I feel that BAS can
more effectively deal with Black
fraternities and sororities in sev-
eral ways: (it make BAS act as
a referral service so that non-
“Greeks" could work with the
community programs that Black
fraternities and sororities have
created: <2) create a seat on the
BAS Steering Committee to be
filled by the representative from
a Black Greek Council (Which I
would like to see organized again;.

I feel the most important factor
is that I have experience to solve
some of the very obvious prob-
lems that exist. You can see that
my platform is very specific. and
that is because I have learned.
through experience. what is need-
ed. I would appreciate your sup-
port and your \/Ulk‘. Thanx.

BAS Candidates Project Ambitions

Namosha Smith

I feel my role as a Black stu-
dent should involve more titan just
going to classes and studying. I
don't feel that Black students can
afford such an academic lux-
ury. Life involves more than this.

My conscious dictates to me a
role in the struggle for humanity.
I cannot allow myself to push
aside for tomorrow ‘what I can do
today. As a young Black woman
in these troubled times I feel the
responsibility to humanity and
Black people specifically: there-
fore. I have chosen at this point in
my life to work with the BAS in
order to bring about changes as
well as create new ideas for Black
people. '

Although this is but a small
part, I feel that it is significant in
that I am not only dealing with the
present but preparing myself for
the future times when bigger and
more complex endeavors will
confront me.

I have a commitment to my
brothers and sisters and a deep
love: these are the most basic
reasons which direct my actions.
Experience and knowledge gain-
ed through my past involvement
have. I feel. properly prepared me
to fulfill the duties of deputy chair-
man within the Black Action So-
ciety.

I hope that you have enough
faith in my abilities and commit-
ment to allow me to work with

you during the following year.
Peace. power. and productivity.

Bill Lowman

For the past year I have been
co-chairman of the Political Ac-

tion Committee of BAS. In this a

position I have been able to
gather a lot of information and
insight into how the Black Action
Society can more effectively
serve the needs of Black stu-
dents.

Coordination of Black depart-
ments on campus and better com-
munications with students (being
where they are) seem to be ma-
jor obstacles for BAS. I have
campaigned very hard. mainly
because I am an eas_v-going. soft-
spoken person. I don't feel that
this is an obstacle to my doing the
job in that the main purpose of
the deputy chairman is to back
up the chairman and be able to
act in hisvabsence.

Some projects that I am person-
ally interested in are getting
Black students more active in
their own education (UCEP, Black
Studies, etc.) by having Black
students write their own courses.
I also have a few ideas about
communications, such as more
personal contact and making
meetings more enjoyable.

Some of these ideas won‘t work
if they are known bef'ore-hand be-
cause of their nature. As these
are only a few of my ideas. per-
haps we can talk some more at
the polls.

_ P.'age6—-THE PITT NEWS——Wednesda_y, March 28, 1973

Pinball players have develop-
ed some extremely unique ap-
proaches to the game. They‘re
superstitious about it. They‘ll ap-
preach the machine one way and
only one way. Right foot slightly
ahead of the left. just four inches
behind the machine. thumbs rest-
ing on the glass top with their
middle fingers operating the flip-
per switches. This technique puts
the player right on top of the ac-
tion. "I can see the ball clearly
all the time." said a player in

. Cozy's bar. “And I don't put as

much pressure on the machine.
Get fewer tilts that way. Man. I

   
 

hate to tilt a machine. That's a lot
of money to lose. especially if it's
the first or second ball.“

Other experts . prefer the
stretched-out approach. As be-
fore, the right foot is still slightly
ahead of the left, but both feet are
planted about three feet away
from the machine. The player's
palms rest on the glass and he
operates the flippers with his first
fingers. “You know, I can really
shake a machinethat way without
tilting it. Somehow

"Yeah. whenever I the

.“Why do you play?”

"Oh. I don't really know. At
first it was just something to do.
You know. a game to take up time.

had to play a machine to cool my

Once I had 15 games on a machine,

put the next ball into play. Like
the first it flew through the ma-
chine-bouncing off bumpers, ring-
ing bells and scoring points. When
it finally dropped out of play I
had a total of 2,532 points-with
two more balls left to play. My
hands started to shake. I drank
some more beer.

Ball four hit a special target
and increased the bumper values
from 10 to 50 points. Now I was
‘sure I had a replay. Another 757
points appeared on the’ score
before the ball drained._ Only 211
points away, I thought. as I drank
another long sip of beer. I no-
ticed the beer was starting to get
warm, but winning this free game
was more important than any
beer had ever been.

the machine. “Le ‘s go baby.“
The ball dropped down through the

150 points. It flew toward a space
on the side of the machine. I saw
it coming. I couldn't let it drain
off—only a couplemore points.
I panicked and shook the machine.
nothing gentle but a sharp hard
shake. The lights went out. The
bells stopped. The machine went
dead in my hands. “Oh no." I mut-
tered. "How could I tilt it. I wa

so close.” ,«

Now I had the fever. I reached
in my pocket for another quarter.
but I didn‘t have any change. All
I had left was a dollar for lunch.

me paused a moment between
balls. “Hey." I -asked. "Got

by CHARLES HUFFMAN

Theatre is an art-form which
may encompass a wide variety of
roles. depending on what society
requires of it. One of the most
basic of these is that of enter-
tainiiient—providing a diversion
and a temporary release for the
harried intellect. A good example
of theatre whose primary func-
tion is entertainment is the Stu-
dio -Theatre's current production
of Oscar Wilde's The Importance
of Being Earnest. This particular
role of the theatre was far more
vital in Wil-de‘s day than it is in
this age of multi—media Muzak
provided by television and a
seemingly endless stream of over-
ly sentimental films.

The work is an interesting show-
piece from a now forgotten age
when Wilde was shocking rather
than merely quaint. Director Bar-
ry Klassel has a grasp of this as-
pect of the play. He carefully and

completely orcliestrates all the"

major “punch lines“ provided by
the script.

Wednesday, March 28, 197’3—THE PITT NEWS——Page 7

Wi/deP/ay Produced at Pitt  

The skillful renderings of Lady
Bracknell by Mary Jacobs-Ford,
and Paula Swart as her indeter-
minable daughter, Gwendolen,
combined with Wilde’s caustic
view of women, produces a tour-
de-farce of bitchiness. Their per-
formances, as well as that of
Mimi Skoog’s Cecily Cardew,
were the high point of the show.
All three were refreshingly pow-
erful and convincing despite the
difficult, highly stylized char-
acters they portrayed.

Another high point was the per-
formance of Michael Curran in
the three separate secondary
characters he played. Curran
proved himself quite versitile and
capable of a dead—pan of which

‘Buster Keaton himself would be

proud. V

The other male roles did not
fare so well. however. No matter
how they strained to manage their

characters. they continually left»

the unmistakable impression that
they were quoting Wilde rather
than engage in a dialogue. This

, was due mainly to the nature of

the script which. like most of
Wilde's .work. is self-conscious-
ly and over-bearingly quotable.
The set design and other physi-
cal aspects of the production
were exactly as most of the other
productions of the Studio Theatre.
That is, very adequate and clever-

ly efficient, but hardlvinspira-‘

tional.

The production is definitely en-
tertaining and geared to be an au-
dience pleaser. It provides a gen-
erous supply of low-key humor and
light philosophizing which makes
it an excellent investment of leis-
ure time and the price of a ticket.

members of the first team include

Pepperdine. '

The second team has Notre

The squad was selected by the
Pitt players, coaches, and all
others who had seen every Pitt
game, home and away, and was
based on the players’ perform-
ances only in games against Pitt.

Walton dominated all facets of
the game in Pitt’s Christmas visit
to the west coast. and Averitt

    The / Last

By BART MACK
Associate Sports Editor
When the 1972-73 Western Pennsylvania- Intercollegiate
:—Hockey Association Season began,‘ I’ll have to admit that my
enthusiasm concerning the progress of the talent in the league

was not running very. high. In fact. it was my opinion that‘

competition among the few teams that did display a certain
degree of equality last year wouldn't amount to much more
than it had during the previous season. 4 I

To say the least, my opinions ‘have changed over the last

five months. As it turned out. Pitt did not make complete.

shambles of their opponents. as expected. Back in October.
that is what I had full_v predicted. but early in December
something happened that thoroughly shocked this reporter.

The Pitt Hockey Club actually lost to Carnegie-Mellon.
Now the general rule in any sport. is that any team has

‘ the potential to defeat any other given team on any given

night. Hockey is no exception. The Boston Bruins, Montreal
Canadians, etc. all have a bad night here and there and wind

seem likely that ‘anything out of the ordinary would stand in
the way of a repeat performance. I

After realizing that the caliber in the league had risen
rapidly I had to be happy; wrongabout the level of compe-

tition but nonetheless glad to see that hockey was indeed find— 5

ing a foothold in the Pittsburgh area. It might not be much
to rejoice over, but any improvement. no matter how slight.
shows the fruits of hard work. I -

A lot of people that think they know something about
hockey have remarked that the local college circuit is noth-
ing more than a joke of some sort. It incensed me to no end
to hear some self—proclaimed authority put down the WPIHA
a_fter'viewing only a game or two. After you’re a part of all
ﬁithat hard work you react more intensely to adverse com-

*3” merits.

.’

Last Sunday night, however, the championship game
for the Commissioners Cup could have entertained those cri-
tics for hours. Let me clarify that; Not the game itself. In-
diana put up a fine showing for a spur of the moment pre-
paration. It was just the fact that they wound up playing Pitt
that made the title contest a bit less momentous than it should
have been. -

Originally. Carnegie—Mellon was to appear at the Al-
Hpine Ice Chalet to meet Pitt for the Cup but the Tartans had
‘to forfeit their berth in the finals. It seemed that sprin
break started at C-MU the Wednesday before the game and
the Tartans stated that they, could not field a team due to the

W(llt0Il Paces UCLA I .,
To 7th Straight Title 

By RON SIEGEL
Sports Editor

For a while Monday night it
looked like the UCLA Bruins
would lose the game that mat-
tered most. but Bill Walton took
charge despite being in f'oul ‘trou-
ble and led the Bruins to a 87-
66 victory over Memphis State.
The win gave coach John Wood-
en's charges their seventh straight
national collegiate basketball ti-
tle.

_The - game started out close.
and remained so throughout the
first half. as Memphis State re-
fused to believe that the Bruins
were invincible. Led by hot-

I shooting guard Larry Finch. the
Tigers tied the score four separ-

ate times in the half. and although

the Bruins built up a seven point‘

lead at one point. Memphis State

. rallied to tie the score at the half.

Soon after the second half be-
gan. Walton took complete con-
trol and put the game out of the
Tigers‘ reach. Walton had pick-
ed up three personal fouls in the

I first half. and was forced to sit

out the end of it. He never stop-
ped when _he was in. and put
on a ,one—man flurry in the second
half. ‘scoring eight straight points.
to open up a lead that never
closed.

Walton never stopped scoring
or playing aggressively, despite
picking up his fourth personal,
and -when he left the game with
four minutes left due to a hard

fall, he had hit on 21 out of 22 '

At this point the Civil Engi-
neers began to come alive. Steve
Lenart converted his own steal
into two points and Len Raffa hit
for two quick field goals putting
the Civils back in the ball game.
However’, several miscues, field
goals by Wall and Kerby and tough
rebounding by Buckmon allowed
Black Flash to recover a comfort-
able lead which they were never
to relinquish.

The first half ended with the
Civils‘ Rich Connors getting foul-
ed while shooting a layup. The
bucket was good and with no time
showing Connors converted the
free throw. making the halftime
score 25-15.

on two easy layups with assists
from Buckmon and Wall and Less
Block popping two field goals
with both assists coming from
Wall. The Civils. plagued by miss-
ed shots and no rebounding scored
intermittently on the shooting of
Lenart and Connors and at one‘
point surged to within 10 points
of the lead.

However, Black Flash was
clearly in command throughout
the second half and it was only a
matter of time. With tempers
flaring, the final buzzer sounded
with ‘the Black Flash ahead, 52-

Indiana Dunks

The Pitt‘s womens basketball
team dropped a close 48-46 deci-
sion to Indiana last night in the
semifinals of the St.
Women's Basketball Tournament.
The Pitt cagers found themselves
behind throughout most of the con-
test and staged a hard-fought
fourth period comeback that fell
just short. ‘ .

The first quarter -was a defen-

fact that the members would not be able to overcome the
travel difficulties involved.

C’MU captain Jim Powers also said that his team had not
been informed of the date for thechampionship game until.
a week before it was to take place. That's hard to believe.
since Pitt knew that the finals would begin on March 25 back
in December.

So C-MU wanted to postpone the game until the school
resumed the term. .The question was then put to the Pitt skat-
ers, or rather the Pitt skaters then put the question that would
decide it all up to themselves; did they want to wait to play
Carnegie-Mellon or did they want to insist that the original
schedule be adhered to‘?

The reactions from the team members came instantan-
eously. They wanted to play the title game on Sundayand
they came to that resolution because of two primary rea-
sons. First. the season had dragged on through five months
when there was only 14 league games played. Finals are
coming up and the skaters weren’t about to but the C-MU
alibies. V ,

Secondly. Pitt thought that if Carnegie—Mellon.wanted
the Commissioners Cup bad enough. they‘d be at the Alpine
for the game in hell or high water. - '

The Pitt skaters were right. Why should they wait over
a week after defeating St. Vincents in the semi-finals to play
the final game? It was obviously an inconvenience to Pitt
and there’s no reason in the world for them to put up with‘
it.. -

llllllllllllllllllllllllll
_ llllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE '' -7’

V“

J’?

So it was Pitt against somebody for the Cup. The likely? _,,.

choice was Indiana. even though St. Vincents had as much
right to be in the finals. The game. even though a heated
contest. lacked the credibility of a true championship event.
Indiana put on a fine show but the mere fact that they had
to be inserted into the finals at the last minute turned all of
that hard work into nothing less thana joke.

The blame has to fall on the league officials. It's tough
to schedule around the vacations of eight schools but the sit-
uation on Sunday night could have been avoided. If the WPI-
HA is going to represent hockey on the college level in the
Pittsburgh area. they had better get some people in the right
places that have the time andfenthusiasm to carry out the
job efficiently. There’s quite a few of them around and
I'd wish they’d speak up. '

As far as I’m concerned, there is no champion of the
WPIHA this year. Not until Pitt meets C-MU could the mat-
ter be settled-and that will not happen this year. 1'

Letter To The Editor

Dear Sports Editor.

Notre Dame's showing in the NIT should stand alone in refuting
Vince DiNardo‘s opinion of their credentials for post season play.
Tom Gormans irresponsible and baseless opinion conclures visions of

a headless human.

The Notre Dame football squad voted not to participate in a bowl
after the 1971 season because it was not in the interest of the squad.
As the individuals on the squad perceived the ramifications of a bowl
according to their varied interests. it would not be fair to label those
interests as generally racist. At the time of the vote to accept or re-
ject a bowl bid. no information was available as to the application of
funds toward minority concerns at the university. iThe previous sea-

son when the squad was assured the majority of funds would go to min-t

ority interests. the team voted to accept bowl ivitations.I

Assertations that the coaches insert players into lineups becuase
of skin color considerations are groundless. Coaches are interested in
winning games and not in shaping sociological patterns for alumni to
look into and scrutinize. All good coaches have one basic fault—when
evaluating players they are color blind. 4 -
