Escorts start toclay

By Cesca Antonelli
Staff Writer

Starting tonight, Pitt students can have a
safer walk home. The Student Government
Board’s new student escort service, Student
Assisted Fast Escort, will take calls for the

first time.

“This has been many, many years in the
said Jocelyn Cortese, the student
director of the escort service. “The concept

making,’

had been around a long time.

“Parking and Transportation has been
pushing to create a service that fills in the
shady areas where it’s better to walk [than

to use Van Call].”

The system is designed to enhance safe-
ty programs that already exist and to pro-
mote safety on campus by providing stu-
dents with escorts. It will operate every

day of the regular semester, including
weekends, from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m. The
system will exist on main, or lower, cam-

pus.

or from a building to a parking lot.

“This is an urban area. A lot of the
buildings are open late at night,” Cortese
said. “Nine out of 10 people go alone. It’s
not as safe alone, so we stress the buddy

system.”

Is the allocations process tlawecl?

By Julie D. Hannon
Asst. News Editor

Student Government Board President
Andy Wuertele believes the student
body should applaud the board for
receiving more than $14,000 in student
activity fees to be used to buy computer
equipment for its office.

But this should not be because the
purchase would benefit the campus.

Rather, Wuertele stated, “We could’ve
waited until summer when no one was
really around to make the request, but
instead, we chose to be upfront.”

This attitude lends weight to the argu-
ment that there are kinks in the alloca-
tions process, especially when it con-
cerns requests from the board.

Allocations member Andy Miller
might have said it best when he voiced
his opinion in open forum of an SGB
meeting two weeks ago.

“I fully believe this [money for the

News Analysis

computer equipment] is a want, not a
need. Furthermore, I find personally
that the SGB is not willing to fundraise
for something they want, such as the
computers, when you ask other groups
to do the same.”

The allocations process, the means by
which all student groups request money,
is a complicated one. To start, groups fit
into one of two categories.

The governance category includes
seven student groups: the Black Action
Society, Engineering Student Council,
the Nurses’ Student Association,
Panhellenic Association, Inter-
Fraternity Council, Resident Student
Association and the’ Academy of
Students of Pharmacy.

The groups are lumped together
because" they are governing bodies that
are directly tied to a university depart-

ment, and they have branch groups
which fall under them. Because they
represent a large portion of the student
body, they are given priority.

The second group is termed as student
organizations and encompasses about
170 student groups. They have a more
narrowly defined interest, one that may
not possess a campus-wide appeal.

The Allocations Committee receives
$435,000 to distribute to student groups,
totaling 50 percent of the total student
activity funds. Although the committee
must followthe restrictions set by the
vice chancel1or’s office, like which
types of requests are possible, the 11
members of the Allocations Committee
plus the chair work directly with the
groups and route the funds.

Allocations Chair Brian Kavalukas
said that Pitt is the only university in
the country which allows a committee
of students to distribute student funds

Israelis close off West Bank, Gaza

E% World Events

JERUSALEM — The Israeli
government closed off the
West Bank and Gaza Strip
until further notice, saying
that it had intelligence infor-
mation that Muslim militants
were planning a terrorist
attack.

The closing, which bars
Palestinian Arabs from enter-
ing Israel proper except in
exceptional cases, infuriated
the Palestinians, especially
since it barred many Muslims
from worshipping at the Al
Aksa mosque in Jerusalem in
the last week of the sacred
month of Ramadan. The New

UNITED NATIONS — Talks

WASHINGTON — The

Defense Department
announced that NATO troops
in Bosnia would be provided
with fuller descriptions and
new, clearer photographs of
the people suspected of war
crimes. The move could make
their arrest at NATO check-
points more likely even if it
does not end the confusion
over the depth of the
alliance’s commitment to
bring war criminals in Bosnia
to justice.

While the Pentagon contin-
ued to insist that American
troops were not engaged in
the manhunt, the expanded
dossiers should make it easier
for troops to identify and

WASHINGTON — Civil
rights groups assailed propos-
als endorsed by the nation’s
governors last week to give
states vast new authority over
welfare and Medicaid. They
said that “African—American
children will be disproportion-
ately harmed” by the changes.

‘ Members’ of the National
Governors’ Association
asserted that they could be
trusted to protect the interests
of poor people. But the civil
rights groups said that the pro-

posals, recommended unani-
mously by the governors,
“would make more children
and families poor and deepen
the deprivation of already
impoverished children.” The

WASHINGTON — A rise in
theuse of methamphetamine
in California and the

among law enforcement offi-

Clinton signed an executive
order to prohibit companies

Middle of relationships
can be difficult too

MYTH: Relationships are

but in between there are no

It may be a fear of getting

rather than administrators.

“I think it’s a great sys-
tem,” said Kavalukas.
“Students are more in touch
with their peers; they under-
stand what is valued on cam-
pus because they are living it.
They have a better feel for
the quality of programs.”

But because students are
allowed so much power, the
question of favoritism is con-
tinually raised.

“Our goal is to maximize
the benefits of all groups on
campus,” says Kavalukas.
“There is no favoritism or
bias, and- students need to
realize that. The committee
works hard to ensure it.”

Kavalukas stresses that cer-
tain aspects holds priority
when considering a group’s
request. Educational pro-
grams and service programs
for students and the universi-
ty, as well as cultural pro-
grams, hold top stature. The
committee must also consider
how many students ‘the
request will benefit and if the
need is met by any other
existing group or program.

Each Allocations member
is assigned to several student
groups and acts as their liai-
son. The liaison meets -with
the groups about their needs,
helps them to ask for funds
through the correct channels
and then reports their needs
to the Allocations Committee
at budget time.

“We do everything we can
to help meet the needs of
groups,” says Kavalukas.
“We stress for group leaders
to take advantage of the time
set aside to meet with their
liaison. I think if they knew
more about what we consider,
it would benefit individual
groups. That could be done

, by simply reading the alloca-

tions manual.”

The committee also insists
that groups prioritize their
needs when planning their
budgets.

When requests are made,
Kavalukas says, the commit-
tee spends, on average, about
20 minutes discussing each
proposal. They then vote to
deny, accept or modify the
request.

The committee then reports
its suggestion to SGB. In
turn, SGB votes to deny or
accept the proposal. This is
where some of the controver-
sy begins.

While it’s the members of
the Allocations Committee
who meet directly with stu-
dent groups and investigate
the request, the SGB has the
final say. According to

-Kavalukas, the board, on

average, considers each
request for about three min-
utes, compared to the com-
mittee’s average of 20.

“It can be frustrating, and
sometimes I wish they would
take our suggestions more
seriously,” says Kavalukas.
“A committee of 12 takes the
time to seriously consider
each request, and then a

group of eight think some-
thing else. But I feel it is use-
ful. It’s a type of check.”

How the committee could
be viewed as a check is
another point of controversy.
When SGB requests funds, it
goes through the same steps
that any other student group
must take, but still has the
final say. '

Wuertele said he doesn’t
view the committee as a
check, but rather as a tool
used to investigate and offer
educated suggestions.

“We consider what
Allocations suggests very
seriously. After they denied
our request for the computer
equipment, it forced us to go
back and reconsider. The
committee brings to light
things we may not_originally
consider.”

SGB gels computers

After deliberating and
tabling the decision for
three weeks, SGB quickly
approved $14,663 for a new
computer system for its
William Pitt Union office.

With the vote, the board
ignored the Allocations
Committee recommendation
that the funds be denied.

“It has been determined
that sufficient funds exist
[for the new computers],”
said board member Lee
Banister at Tuesday night’s
meeting.

The board originally
requested the money last
month, but twice the
Allocations Committee,
chaired by Brian Kavalukas,

recommended that the pro-
posal be denied.

At SGB’s Jan. 30 meet-
ing, board member Lauren
Leiter motioned to table the
request. It was postponed
until last night, when all the
board members except
Leiter voted to overrule the
Allocations Committee and
to take the funds.

SGB President Andy
Wuertele said that although
the board voted to get all
the money, “two computers
will be purchased at first,”
and then the board will
determine if others are nec-
essary.

For others, the fear origi-

to have a healthy relation-

paralyze an individual and
cause a potential relationship
to terminate prematurely.

You can choose to play “cat

relationship, or you can con-
front your fears by taking a
risk(s): Risk developing your

by approaching a team not respond-
ing to a call. The team will collect
information from the student, check
it in with the dispatcher and then
escort the student to his or her desti-
nation. The escort service does not
take advance reservations.

When the escort teams arrives,
it will meet the caller and present
photo IDs. Escorts also wear jackets
with the escort service logo on
them. They will walk the caller
to his or her destination and then
radio the new location to the dis-
patcher.

The escort service operates under
the same policies as Van Call. It

does not provide service to or from
bars or restaurants. Individuals may
be denied service if escorts think
they are intoxicated or under the
influence of drugs.

“The intention here is not to get
involved in the business of escorting
students from one party to another.
It is a safe escort for students who
earnestly need it, who are involved
in a university activity, like study-
ing,” Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd
said. i

When Night is Falling
Directed by Patricia Rozema
With Pascale Bussieres,
Rachael Crawford and Henry
Czerny

Some people can say more
with images than words.
Patricia Rozema, writer and
director, is one. With When
Night is Falling, Rozema's
camera tells us more than her
stock plot.

When Night Is Falling is an
exploration of a love affair
between two women. What
rescues the contrived plot from
turning into a bad cliché is the
camera work that paints
images full of grace and mysti-
cism. Teeming with warm yel-
lows and rich burgundies, the
scenery evokes a warm and
sensual beauty on the screen.
Camera angles accentuate the
actors’ graceful movements,
whether they are acrobats at
the circus or lovers in the bed-
room. The film glows with a
mysticism that lulls the audi-
genes into believing they are
watching a brilliant love story

— until the lights go up and '

the magic is over.

The plot, largely predictable,
is a love saga of a beautiful
Christian woman and profes-
sor of a Protestant college.
Camille, played by Pascale
Bussieres, has a romance
brewing with Martin, a fellow
professor (Henry Czerny). In
line for a promotion to become
co-chaplains of the college,
the couple is encouraged to

marry. The Reverend DeBoer
(David Fox), dean of the col-
Iege, stresses that it would
hardly be right for the chap-
lains of a Christian institution
to engage in the “pleasures” of
married life without the cre-
ation of the holy bond. Despite‘
the possibilities of change and

new beginnings that lie at her -

feet, Camille is unhappy and
restless with her life.

Camille is pushed over the
edge with the sudden death of
her beloved dog, found dead
in an alley. Still crying over her
dear, departed friend later that

. day at a laundromat, Camille

catches the eye of Petra, an
eccentric circus performer
played by Rachael Crawford.
After flirtatiously offering
Camille comfort, Petra quickly

gathers up her laundry and

makes an exit. Predictably,

she’s made a switch, taking
Camille’s, laundry and leaving
her own behind with a busi-
ness card.

With Petra’s laundry in hand,
Camille sets out to find this
mysterious woman. The
address leads her to the
“Circus of Sorts,” a “modern
primitive” circus that offers
Camille all the intrigue and
seduction her life has been
missing. Petra invites Camille
back to her trailer for a night-

cap and even though Camille ,

says she doesn’t drink, Petra
talks her into one. Camille
bolts for the door when Petra’s
comments about her desires
for Camille’s beauty become
too much for her to handle. But
Petra won't give up that easily.
She shows up the next day
outside Camille’s apartment to
shoot an arrow that carries a

 

T Patricia Rozema's When Night is Falling runs at the Harris theater, downtown, starting this Friday.

picture of herself, with her tele-
phone number scrawledon the
back, through Camille’s win-
dow. Camille offers Petra
inside without words. Just
inside her door, Camille is the
one to make the first move.
She kisses Petra, but immedi-
ately runs to her car to drive

‘away and escape.

"Petra’s presence in
Camille’s life has sparked a
new passion that we see in her
relationship with Martin and in
front of a board of directors at
her interview for the chaplain-
ship, where she defends
homosexuality. Despite her ini-
tial reaction to pass the kiss off
as a momentary lapse of rea-

son, Camille’s desire for Petra ‘

grows until she realizes that
her life would be incomplete
without her. After Camille dis-

closes her new love for Petra-

     

to the Reverend,and Martin
discovers the source of
Camille’s recent passion,
Camille decides to join Petra
when the circus leaves town.
While the topic of liberation
through a lesbian love affair is
one that deems commentary,
what we get with Rozema’s
piece are clichéd exultations
and a feel-good story. To top it
off, a triumphant chorus of
f‘Ha|le|ujah” rings throughout
the theater as the credits roll.
When Night is Falling opens
Friday night at the Harris the-
ater, downtown. Showtimes
are 6 and 8 p.m Mon-Sat, 3
and 5 p.m. Sunday.

Hegemony Still Sucks

Spin Magazine’s Alternative
Record Guide

Edited by Eric Weisbard with
Chris Marks

Published by A Vintage Original
$20.00

Somewhere an indiscriminate
Kurt Loder-type coined the
phrase “alternative music” (when
I started listening to music it was
called “new wave”) to describe
the sound of British bands com-
ing to America: Echo and The
Bunnymen, The Smiths, The
Cure — those prolific Brits.

Alternative music and I allied
in the late ‘80s after a bohemian
moment on the school bus lis-
tening to the Smiths’ “Queen is
Dead.” Afterwards, I re-config-
ured my music library to new
wave, indulged in a sub-culture
of vinyl and became a fan of
anonymous bands.

What was once bohemian is
now generic, as Spinfs
Alternative Record Guide
reviews “the essential artist and
albums of punk, new wave, indie
rock and hip-hop.” One of the
main problems is it doesn’t go
for the “essential.” A large por-
tion stays within a shallow range
of albums that can be detected
just by looking at college radio
charts. it doesn’t go deep
enough. in the 400-plus pages
of text, the guide seems to have
to left out a few stops.

This is like a trip to an amuse-
ment park where you are too big
to get on all the rides, so you
just have to sit back and watch

 
   

      “E6

a

— let all the little kiddies get on,
because you’ve done it already.
Bands such as Suede and com-
pilations such as Just Can’t Get
Enough: New Wave Hits get
reviewed because of their novel-
ty, and bands like the Wedding
Present and the soundtrack for
Matter of Degrees or even the
popular Singles were over-
looked. (The Ftepo Man sound-
track is the only one reviewed.)

With such an extensive topic,
it would be difficult to include
everything. “Bands that once
seemed alternative, Squeeze
and Metallica for instance, aren’t
here because somewhere along
the way they merged back into
rock.” This book is full of rock!
Pearl Jam, Beck, Hole and REM
play rock, look like rock and
taste like rock — this is definitely
rock. So is this a rock guide or
an alternative guide?

The volume begins with the
introductory chapter “What is
alternative rock?” Well, accord-
ing to the new Revolution, it’s
defined by bands such as Stone
Temple Pilots, Smashing
Pumpkins and Green Day. The
text offers very little in flourishing
a new definition. Everyone has
their own, so let’s leave it like
that. So as the book tries to
crystallize the definition, I think
many people are going to be
saying, “Huh?” or “l already
knew that.” My alternative is not
the same as my brother’s, but
he tells me that he’s tuned into
alternative music after seeing
Live.

In various portions of the
book, contributors, rock icons
and people in the music biz offer
their top 10 albums of all time.
This acts as a catalyst for learn-
ing more about music than do
the writers’ reviews. Several
celebritieslisted Prince’s Purple
Rain and Young Marble Giant’s
Colossal Youth as favorite LPs

of all time, so I was more '

inclined to read about those LPs
than the editors’ choice of
Flamones’ Flamones as their
number one album of all time.‘

One thing that shouldn’t be
over-looked is the group of writ-
ers in this book. Spin compiled a
collection of authors from Rolling
Stone, Village Voice, Puncture,
Vibe and Melody Maker. Their
words are diamond sharp, so
they get their point across.
Exploring more as bathroom
material, l’ve read reviews about
bands such as the Shaggs, Lee
Perry and Dwight Yoakam.

Trouser Press Guide, which
predates the book by a couple of
years, is more comp|ete,'even
more “alternative.” Spin’s
Alternative Flecord Guide is not
a primer to alternative music. lt’s
like a spelunker who’s scared to
go deeper. Of course you can
find a gem or two in the shallow
regions, but the treasures are
well beneath. '

Broken Arrow

With John Travolta and
Christian Slater.

Directed by John Woo

To some hard—boiied movie
fans John Woo is an institu-
tion, and to mothers against
violence he is a bullet in the
head. I remember a time when
the only way to see a good
Asian action movie was to go
watch kung fu theater. Then
came John Woo.

. Broken Arrow has a hint of
the Woo we all love, but there
is something tainted about the
whole ordeal. I think it is the
superstar syndrome: Twentieth

Broken Arrow starts off with
a punch. Our two heroes, Vic
Deakins (John Travolta) and
Riley Hale (Christian Slater),
are sparing it out in a boxing
ring just for kicks. Deakins is
trying to teach Hale to box but
Hale just wants to do it his
way. This leads into how the
two characters have their own
style. Besides boxing and just
being pals these two weiners
are stealth bomber‘ pilots for
the Air Force and are also
nuclear-certified. On a mock
mission, Deakins ends up hav-
ing his own ulterior motive and
ejects his best friend Hale from
the plane."-Then Deakins steals

C/temnestra
Directed by Yukihiro
Goto

Translated by J.
Thomas Filmer

Clytemnestra chal-
. lenges reality with an
interpretation of an
ancient Greek tragedy.
0 Director Yukihiro Goto
uses an innovative
Japanese theater tech-
nique which separates
this performance from
American drama. The
actors underwent
extensive conditioning
to be able to execute
_ the high intensity
‘ involved in the actors’
, performances. Taking

 

   

into account the complexity involved,
Goto concentrates on the profound
monologues of each character. The
story's history involves traces of a leg-
end that revolve around mythology,
lust, vengeance and murder. '

The Suzuki method develops the tur-
bulence and chaos in the story by
incorporating a grounded stance of ori-
entation. Stable movements along with
strong poses enable an actor to pro-
ject the lengthy proclamations that
characterize much of the play’s script.
The basis of this approach offers an
alternative approach to mainstream,
theater’s more realistic style. Taking
into account the Japanese origin, this
show experiments with the fundamen-
tal morals of the family unit.

Slip-sliding through flashbacks and
flash forwards, the show teeters on
demented Greek values and corrup-

 

tion. The cast is vivacious and bold as
a result of grueling focus-training.

The story picks up after the 10-year
bloody war between Greece and Troy.
The gore follows King Agamemnon
(Micheal Ian Blunt) as murder corrupts
the monarchy. Clytemnestra (Lorien
Clemens) is the crazed queen who

kills her husband Agamemnon and

serves him for dinner in a gruesome
banquet. Agamemnon did nothing, but
sacrifice his first son and sleep with
the Princess of Troy, to deserve his
demise. The innate insanity continues

when Princess Electra (Desiree Marie,

Ciancio) performs a morbid reenact-
ment of the killing of Clytemnestra’s

lover. The thirst for bloody revenge

continues as Prince Orestes (Joel Lee
Kulp) is coerced into killing his mother.
Kulp’s and Ciancio’s performances as
the persecuted siblings foster the
show with a piercing performance of
passion and pain. The death-like, nude
Furies (Shannon N. Murin, Marie
Sirakos, Leighann Niles) add to the

ghoulish darkness with writhing hymns
of Greek verse. When all morals are
forgotten, Apollo (Robert-Kupperman)
and Athena (D.B. Novinski) put the
flesh-hungry family on trial. The entire-
ty of the play centers around justifying
the numerous murders and affairs the
royal family has indulged in.

The surreal tendencies of this show
are tightly glued together by the
Suzuki expressions and loud move-
ments. The script analyzes gender
power and holds interesting perspec-
tives to an ancient melodrama. In the
overall ‘scope of this show, expect to
be taken on an emotional, drawn-out
ride through the glory of treason and
revenge. ,

The show will continue at The
Stephen Foster Theatre until Feb.
17th. Ca/I 624-PLA Y.

0ur Promise to Pittsburgh: 
“low fares livery llay,
/ Everywhere We fly.”

If you’ve ever wished airfares were lower, your
. time is coming. Because on March 1,Valu]et will begin
ﬂying_ three daily nonstops to Atlanta. And every seat on
every ﬂight is just $59 for travel through March .51, 1996. After
that date, fares as low as $59 will still be available with a Zlday
advance purchase. Seats are available now. '
» From Atlanta you’ll be able to make convenient,
low-fare connections to seven sunny Florida cities, for fares
as low as $79. You can also connect through Atlanta to cities
around the south, including New Orleans, Savannah, and
Dallas-Fort Worth. And you may ﬁnd that the great, big
airlines will lower some of their fares to those destinations
now that ValuJet’s cometo town. Which is why we say,
“The fare’s not fair, unless Valujet ﬂies there.”

Whats A Valulei, Anyway?

Valujet is an Atlanta-based airline founded on the
principle of offering low airfares and friendly, enthusiastic
service. We don’t have a First Class section, we won’t serve
airline food, and we can’t ﬂy you to Europe. But our low fares,
positive attitude, hassle-free “tic_ketless” reservations system,
and lack of restrictions (ValuJet never requires a roundtrip
purchaseor a Saturday night stay,) have resulted in such a high
degree of customer loyalty that Valujet has been described
as, “the most successful start-up in az'rlz'ne history. ”

We invite you to ﬁnd out why for yourself.

Hecuba

by Tim

Directed
Golembiewski
Translated by Kiki

To entice the theater
audience with more
primeval drama, Hecuba
takes a look at the other
side of the Trojan War.
While the Greeks were
busy having sex and killing

A each other, the women of

Troy were faced with a dif-
ferent problem, they
couldn't have sex because

i all the men were killed in

an estranged and fierce
queen, Hecuba, who has
lost her husband and is
faced with the tyranny of
one of the last remaining
men (Paul Nester), who
proceeds to kill the last
prince and a princess.
Director Tim_
Golembiewski has taken
advantage of the dead
space arranged between
the verses by focusing on
the impact of the gaps. By
taking advantage of the
beats between the action,
Golembiewski incorporates
modern media references,
through video cameras and
cyberpunk music. The

theme revolves around the
. deteriorating reality. The
fragmented

into chaos.

Money for nothing

Are you short on money? A lot of people are these days, especially since
the semester is dwindling away. Want a quick solution? Vote yourself some
money.

That’s what the Student Government Board did on Tuesday night.

You might remember when we told you about the process of groups
receiving money from the Allocations Committee. The SGB has the ﬁnal say
over whether or not a group gets money, including whether the SGB itself
will.

Andsincethemernbershavetheﬁnalsay,isitanysurprisethattheyvoted
to give themselves around $15,000? The request had originally been denied
by the Allocations Committee, but now the SGB has the money. The money
is going to be used to buy a new arsenal of computer equipment for the SGB
office.

There really isn’t much else to say about the allocations process, except that
the SGB should not be able to vote itself money after the.Allocations
Committee has turned it down. However, now questions arise over exactly
how the money is going to be used

At Tuesday night's meeting, board member Lauren Leiter suggested that
SGB should buy three computers instead of four. The rest of the board voted
this down, electing to go with the possibility that it might need all four. Instead
of simply taking enough money for the two computers that it will purchase
ﬁrst, theboardhas decidedtotakeallthemoneyatorx:e——justin case.

The point is, only the amount of money needed for what is going to be pur-
chased should even be at issue. There should not be an amount given for
what might be bought at some time in the future. What happens when the
SGB discovers that, possibly, one new computer will be suﬂicient, or even
that no new computer was necessary? Is it going to give back the extra
money or ﬁnd something else in its ofﬁce that needs to be replaced (like the

Xmplus for pedestrians

A hearty “Thank You” to the city of Pittsburgh! Begimring in March, you
mightﬁnditalittle easierto gettoclasses inthe Cathedral. Thecity hasﬁnally
decided to shut down Bigelow Boulevard for a two-month trial run. No more

way—in-a-crosswalk rule or with the ones who believe that the ﬁrst two sec-
onds ofaredlightarereallyonlypink,andiftheygofastenoughtheycanget

Hopefully, this trial run will prove successful, since it really doesn’t take
much effort to drive one more block to Belleﬁeld or Bouquet (depending on
which direction you’re facing to begin with). If you commute, or just like to
drive around campus, just remember that you probably hoof it across
Bigelow at least once in a while along with the rest of the shoe-leather
express. Takeadeepbreath, grinandbearit, and drivetheextrablockto get

Yes, BUT

9lPFeKeNCe?

    
   

Are you an “Us” or a “Them”?

Are you an US or a THEM?
The university has conducted
a study to see the effects and
causes of animosity between
the Greek and non-Greek
community. What complete
and utter tripe. The Greeks
surveyed for the study say
they are “tired of being per-
ceived as beer guzzling, per-
verted jocks and brainless,
materialistic snobs.”
Independents abhor the per-
ception that they are “either a
blue-haired, body-pierced,
Beehive regular or pocket-
protector wearing computer
nerd.” Sniff! That’s such a sad
story. -
Who cares? Let me set the
record straight: These stereo-
types are wrong, and this
study is pathetic. Piercings are
prevalentthroughout the uni-
versity’s diverse community
and my best friend in the
Greek community has the
coolest tattoos I’ve ever seen.

Most of the Independents I
know don’t fit any of the crite-
rion mentioned in the “study.”
I personally have brown regu-
lar-cut hair, can barely type
(as my editors can attest),
have never seen a pocket pro-
tector and think that after
Army coffee anything avail-
able in Oakland rules. The
people I used to guzzle beer
with were both Greek and
Independent, and after a cou-
ple of brews we were all
brainless. _

I feel obligated to indulge
myself in some amateur psy-
chology here: Could this situ-
ation possibly be connected to
behavior? Do the activities of
group rape, death through
alcohol poisoning and the sex-
ual harassment of women ring
any bells on campus? The
estimable Keri Ryan, purveyor
of this “study,” claims that
negative press only aggravates
the situation. How much good
press is going to be enough to
counterbalance the percep-
tions caused by reporting

V infractions and-crim_es. com.-

Patrick
McKelvey

mitted by Greeks?

I say it is behavior that
causes the problems in percep-
tion of the Greeks within the
community. The Pitt News is
not directly responsible for the
abuse of and animosity
between this campus’ Greek
system and its Independents.
If one in the Greek communi-
ty wishes to say I am creating
animosity towards their com-
munity, hear me say this: You
guys (sorry, people) are all
individuals just like me. The
only problem is that the crowd
you run with has this tendency
to mess up in big ways. If you
want to say, “These are the
people I stand with,” you are
going to fall with them as
well.

I happen to be the proud
member of a fraternal organi-
zation, the VFW. I got hazed
by the pros, so I don’t think
you’ve got anything on frater-
nity row that will impress me
in the pledging department.
The key for me is to realize
that there are other lifestyles
out there. Cowards, shirkers
and whiners are people too.
(Maybe that seems harsh but
 its true.)'

As for the availability of
resources to those of us who
have no Greek letters tattooed
on our bodies, I’m not suffer-
ing from a lack of educational
resources at this university. Is
there a computer lab on cam-
pus that you need to know the
secret handshake to get into?
As for their access to leader-
ship positions, what can I say?
They make their pledges,
brothers and sisters vote.

I understand the bond of
brotherhood and undying loy-
alty, and it is one of the great-
est feelings in the world. I
have friends in whose hands

I’ve literally put my life, and"

they can and will ask favors of
me that I would never refuse.

We depend on the fact that our

backs will always be covered
by a comrade-in-arms. The
difference is that you chose to
be aligned with certain other
people, and some of them are
well, for lack of a better word,
criminals. Oddly enough,
when these individuals get
busted, there seems to be an
attempt to cover their tracks
for so long, but when the whip
comes down, brotherhood is
speedily replaced with C.Y.A.
Maybe a little preventative
maintenance would help the
“Greek Image Problem.” Then
again, maybe not.

In these times of diversity
on this campus, I have
encountered people from all
walks of life, and whatever
their ethnic, religious, eco-
nomic and/or “other group”
affiliation I have judged them
as people, not as members of
their particular activities out-
side of my relationship with
them. I DO judge them on
character and personal behav-
ior. Don’t we all do that? It’s
called being an adult. Ms.
Ryan, apparently the children
you “studied" are just that,
children. I suggest that is the
reason for the answers you
received in your “study.”

By the way, let’s do a little
personal, inventory here.
Whether you are G or I, what
are your perceptions of your
“others?” Would you really
describe the other in those
terms, or did Ms. Ryan only
share her most inﬂammatory
language here with us in
hopes of justifying her pathet-
ic study? If those are the terms
in which you think, you have
a hell of a lot of maturing to

do. You don’t belong here, so.

take your ball and your
“friends” and go home. If (to
you) I, as an Independent, am
the “other,” be my pen pal by
writing pgmst6@pitt.edu. You
may learn that we aren’t so
different. -

Syracuse’s Mary Duffy fights for the ball against Latia
Howard (1) and Gina Montesano (r). '

Lady Panthers fall
71 -60 to Syracuse

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

As a Valentine’s Day present, the Pitt Lady Panthers had ﬂow-
ers for the first 200 women through the Field House doors last
night. The total attendance was 183, leaving unwanted gifts.

The Syracuse Orangewomen. gave the Lady Panthers another
unwanted gift, as senior center Thandeka Masiminiscored 31
points and led her team to a 71-60 holiday victory.

The 6-foot-4 Masimini controlled the frontcourt all evening,
playing with her back to the basket and scoring over Pitt centers
Latia Howard and Farrah Woods almost at will. She also tallied
ten boards to earn her ninth double-double of the season.

Panther Coach Kirk Bruce called Masimini’s play “dominating”
and said “[she] came in and did whatever she wanted to.”

Masimini had help from her teammates under the boards, with
Racquel Nurse, Mary Duffy and Annetta Davis combining for
another 28 Syracuse rebounds. The Orangewomen totaled 56
boards for the night, compared to only 33 for the Panthers.
Howard and Gina Montesano each had five boards to lead Pitt
underneath. '

“They’re going to have more opportunities than we are if that’s
going to go on,” Bruce said. “Our concern is, a team comes into
our building and just dominates us.” - ’

Orangewoman domination didn’t come until late in the first
period, however, as fast ball movement and outside jumpshots
from Montesano and senior guard Stephanie Petho kept the
Panthers in the game. It took seven points by Syracuse’s Duffy in
the last six minutes of play to give Syracuse a 38-33 halftime

‘ lead. Duffy played all 40 minutes in the contest, finishing with 12

points, nine rebounds and two blocked shots.

The second half began with Howard challenging M_asimini,
answering her four early points with four points of her own in the
half ’s early minutes. Masimini, drawing the Pitt defense toward
the basket, began kicking the ball out to Nurse and forward

~ Carmen Glover, whose outside scoring quickly opened the

Orangewoman lead to double digits) ,

The scoring sent the Lady Panthers into a variety of different
looks, including ful1—court pressure, three-guard rotations and
three minutes of forward Montesano switching to point guard.
Despite the changes and Montesano’s 14 points from three differ-
ent positions, Pitt could not close the lead past sixlpoints for the
rest of the contest.

“We wilted under the pressure,” Bruce said of his team’s perfor-
mance. “I don’t think we defended tonight.”

Bruce_explained the press was a “last resort” for his team to
force turnovers and upset the Syracuse offense. While the pres-
sure resulted in eight second—half Syracuse turnovers, the Panthers
committed nine of their own to take away any advantage.

Pitt returns to the Field House this Saturday night to face Notre
Dame. The Irish defeated the Lady Panthers 91-50 in South Bend

on Feb. 7, and will be coming into the contest with a three-game _
winning streak. Pitt will take a three-game losing streak int .

Saturday evening, alongwith a 3-11 Big East record. ‘

There Mark Blount is, all 7 feet of him, grabbing
a loose ball. In one fluid stroke he takes off from
the dotted line and throws down a lean—in one-
handed hammer that momentarily silences the
Notre Dame crowd.

There Mark Blount goes, all 215 pounds of him, ,
walking towards the sidelines minutes later. He just
fouled out with about seven minutes remaining in
the game. ‘

Pitt’s loss to Notre Dame last Tuesday was not
only a microcosm of Blount’s all-around basketball

‘‘I think Mark has his moments, but for the most
part, he’s had more disappointments than positive
things,” Pitt basketball Coach Ralph Willard said.
“And I think that comes down to the fact that physi-
cally, Mark is not ready for the physical play of the
Big East.” ' .

Blount may not be ready physically, but athleti-
cally, there’s no questioning the 20-year-old cen-
ter’s ability. He showed vignettes of his ability
against Notre Dame as he scored 10 points and
grabbed four boards in 18 minutes. And those
vignettes, or as Willardtermed it, “moments,” have
the Pitt coaching staff itching for the future.
Because, after all, Blount, along withthe other four .
vaunted freshmen, is» the future of Pitt basketball.

And-. at the moment, the future is all Pitt has. In a
season that started off so promisingly, the Panthers
have lost nine of their last 10 games, dropping their

“At the beginning of the year, we were like, ‘We
are going to do this, and we are going to do that,

Blount keeps Panthers smlin ur

Blount said. “Now we’re just learning and getting against N°"th Ca‘°°““a°

better, because next year is going to be our time.”

That may all depend on whether Blount hits the
weight room in the offseason and puts meat on his
wiry frame. “I think in the offseason‘ he needs to put
on 25-30 pounds and really get stronger,”_ Willard
said. “T hat’s what it’s all about.”

If. Blount adds some strength to his already soft
touch, then the future may be closer than many might
think.

“I think by the time he’s a junior, Mark will be one
of the top players in the Big East,” Willard said.

Blount was the big exclamation point on last sum-
mer’s heralded freshman class, which many college

gurus listed as one of the best in the country. But so
far this season, Blount’s play has been anything but
exclamatory. Averaging 3.7 points per game and three

‘rebounds, Blount has been overmatched in almost «

every game. Consequently, he has been mired in foul
trouble all season.‘But he does lead the team in
blocked shots with 18. _ '

Statistics, however, don’t properly gauge Blount’s

' contributions to the team. Whether it’s during practice

or games, Blount‘ is always smiling, clapping and

uplifting his teammates. Even when times were really ‘

bad, like when Villanova crushed Pitt by '33 two
weeks ago, Blount was still playing’ with the enthusi-

I may not be able to contribute as much as I want
to right now, but I’m going to try to help the

That’s the type of person Blount is. He’s
always trying to help the next person.

“Coach tells us to have fun out there, and
that’s what I try to do,” Blount said. “I may not
do everything right, but I try to keep the rest of

Blount bounced around to a couple more

schools before he enrolled at" Dobbs Ferry High
School (N.Y.) in December of ‘94 to finish out
‘ his high school career. Despite missing six games
due to transfer, Blount averaged 24 points, 14
rebounds and six blocks at Dobbs Ferry. He was
named a Parade All-American and was one of
the most coveted big men in the nation.

“I just made the best out of high school,”
Blount said. “I just had fun and tried to bring

Just the media had a problem.” ,

Although Blount was highly touted, he still had no
clue where he was going to college late in the recruit-
ing wars. UMass and Louisville pursued him, but it
wasn’t untilhe had a conversation with ex—Pitt assis-
tant Tom Crean that Blount started thinking Pitt. “I-

-used to see Tom Crean all the time during the sum-

.  . By Mark Gordon
A /5;; _ Editor in Chief

Being three years away from legally drinking a
beer has not stopped John Celestand from regularly
playing basketball with some of the best college
players inthe country. '

Neither has the pressure of playing in front of
thousands of fans, nor running the offense of the
V fourth—ranked team that many say has Final Four
possibilities. "

The burden of playing 100 miles away from
where he excelled in high school also hasn’t fazed
him. .

Celestand is a freshman, on the Villanova
Wildcats, a team which boasts two future top NBA
picks — Kerry Kittles and Jason Lawson —— and is
one of the deepest teams in the Big East.

The 18-year-old from Piscataway, N.J.,,has been
called on by Head Coach Steve Lappas to play more
as the season has progressed, and Celestand has
responded by sparking the Wildcats off the bench
with his tenacious defense.

He didn’t come into the season like many of Pitt’s
freshmen. There weren't the expectations or the pre-
' season accolades that surrounded Pitt’s class. That’s
one reason he’s fit in so well in Philadelphia.
 Panther Head Coach Ralph Willard said playing

with stars like Kittles, Lawson and Eric Eberz has
' given Celestand the opportunity to ease into the
Wildcat program. ' -

i ' His speed and athletic ability don’t hurt either. His
number one position is the point, but at 6-3, he’s big

Vi|ano's Jh Celestand emerges on Big East scene

Celestand has moved up on the Wildcat bench.
Against the then-No. 8 Georgetown Hoyas last
week, Celestand led Villanova with 19 points. He
also grabbed five boards and had two assists.
“He’s very quick with a great feel for the game,”
Lappas says in the Wildcat’s media guide.
Celestand brought the duPont Pavilion crowd to
its feet two weeks ago when Pitt was mauled, 88-55.

He played a season—high 24 minutes in place of

Eberz, who left in the first half with a hip injury.

Celestand played the role of roving defender in
the Wildcats’ zone and he stifled Panther guards
Jerry McCullough and Vonteego Cummings, help-
ing Villanova hold Pitt to 3 of 19 from 3-point terri-
tory. He also finished with 10 points, six assists and
two steals. '

Lappas expects to use Celestand, more frequently
next season. Kittles and Eberz are senio_rs and,
along with Lawson, a junior, might apply for the
NBA draft.

But taking over a high—caliber team is not some-
thing Celestand is a novice at. In his junior and
senior years at Piscataway High School, Celestand
was the Chiefs’ go-to guy as they went to the New
Jersey State finals for two consecutive seasons.

His senior year, Piscataway won the Group IV
title and Celestand was an Associated Press first-
team, all—state selection. He averaged 19 points, 5.5
assists, 5.9 rebounds and three steals per game.

He also began to show his stuff as a money play-
er, connecting on 90 percent of his free-throw

A attempts in the fourth quarter.

“All of the other coaches I

would tell me I could do this
and I could do that,” Blount
said. “But when Coach
Willard came in, he was like,
‘You’re not good. You haven’t
even come closeto reaching
your potential.’ After I thought
about it for a couple of days, I
figured if I wanted to reach
where I want to go, which is
the next level, then I should go
to Pittsburgh.”

But at the press conference
to announce he would be

I attending Pitt in September,

Blount walked out. Later he
came back and officially said
he would be a Panther. “It was
just the jitters, that’s all,”
Blount said.

Blount was the sixth and
final piece to Willard’s recruit-
ing puzzle. Willard effectively
landed two guards and three
forwards (Isaac Hawkins was
ruled ineligible). But with
Blount, he now had a big
inside force. ,

However, in the beginning
of the season, junior college
transfer Gerald Jordan got the
nod at center, leaving Blount
with minimal playing time.
But as Jordan’s play began to
falter, Blount’s minutes picked
up. In fact, Blount has started
five games, and now the two
centers are platooning as the
starter. .

“I just go out there and try to
get into the flow of things,

however we’ need it,” he said.

“It could be by an assist, it
could be by a block shot. I let
the game come to me. I.don’t
want to force anything, try to
do something that I can’t do.”
Whatever Blount wants to

'do,‘ it’s for the team. For exam-

ple, before the season started
most Pitt players ‘shaved their
heads to signify unity. Blount
kept his hair long. About a
month ago, Blount finally
gave in and shaved his head.

“Instead of being an outcast,
I’m just being down for the
team,” he said. .

And in the future, if all of
the freshmen stay “down”
together for four years, Blount
saidthis year will be just
"another pothole in a long and
successful road.

“By our senior year, I’ll say

we should be winning our sec- .

ond national championship,”
Blountsaid- .
