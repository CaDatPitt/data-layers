Gorerally raises student consciousness

Pih‘ shakes up summer sessionﬂschetiul

By Jonathan Mikulak
For The Pitt News

Have you ever thought about taking sum-
mer classes at Pitt but hesitated because of
the idea of having to spend the whole sum-
mer here? That may change next summer.

The university has created an Office of

Summer Sessions, which has proposed a plan
to incorporate a more ﬂexible schedule and
include a wider variety of classes to fit the
specific needs of students.
. “The schedule attempts to respect our stu-
dents’ need for time,” said Darlene Zellers,
the director of the Office of Summer
Sessions. “We understand that the students’
summer break is important. They may have
to work or just need some down time to be
with their friends and family.”

Within the last couple of years, the univer-
sity realized that its summer term needed
some changes. Student enrollment was
declining, and as a result, a number of cours-
es were dropped.

According to a recent CAS survey of stu-
dents, many would like a greater assortment
"of classes, and more times to go, instead of
the traditional 15-week or seven-week cours-
es offered.

On the other side. of the scale, the faculty
didn’t have that much flexibility either. If
faculty members wanted to teach a course,
they would have to teach all summer with no
time off. Overall, everyone thought that the
plan was too rigid, according to Zellers.

The office is concentrating on the interests
of undergraduates, but covers all post-gradu-
ate areas as well.

In the new summer term structure, aside
from the standard l5-week term (May 6 to
Aug. 10), students can choose from the fol-
lowing: ,

°A 12-week session (May 13 to Aug. 3)

0A pair of six-week sessions (May 13 to
June 22 and June 24 to Aug. 3)

°Three four-week sessions (May 13 to June
8, June 10 to July 6 and July 8 to Aug. 3)

0A four-week intercession (May 1 to May
25).

Here’s an example of how the intercession
plan would work: Let’s say you take one
three-credit course. You would go to class
twice a week, for three-and-a-half hours
each class session —— that, of course,
includes a break.

“According to our studies, students felt

Pittsburgh seen as ‘model city‘

By Lori J. Abrams
For The Pitt News

After being kept under a
three-year siege by Bosnian
Serbs, a city representative of
Sarajevo is looking at
Pittsburgh as a model city to
get ideas about restructuring.

A project—funded trip by the
United States Agency for
International Development
jbrought city official Esad
?5Luckin from Sarajevo to the
'United States to help rehabili-
tate the Sarajevo city govern-
ment. Luckin visited Pitt last
week.

Vice president of Sarajevo’s
executive board, Luckin spe-
cializes in administration and
organization. Since being
appointed to this position in
May 1994, his responsibilities
have included organizing the
city administration and prepar-
ing city legislative issues.

Luckin said this “training
trip” helped him accomplish his
objectives of seeing personally
howcity council operates in
different cities, as well as leam—
ing to prepare training for other
city officials in the United

States with the help of the-

Agency for International
Development. Luckin visited
many city and state agencies in
Washington; Arlington County,
Va.; Annapolis, Md.«; and
Pittsburgh.

“This has been a great oppor-

tunity for me,” Luckin said. I
want to thank all who I visited
in Pittsburgh for their help.”

Luckin said he admires
Pittsburgh because of its adapt-
ability in changing from a town
of steel and coal mines to a
metropolitan, thriving city.
Luckin said the citizens of
Pittsburgh made it possible to
change and restructure industry
to produce a city which serves
as an inspiration to him and
Sarajevo.

“That’s what we have to do
in Sarajevo,” Luckin said. “We
have to make it possible to
change and rebuild the way
Pittsburgh did.”

He was interested in seeing
what a city needs, such as com-
panies, industries, city govern-
ment and institutions. Luckin
said he and the citizens of
Sarajevo have a difficult job
ahead which needs to be done
in steps, because the war has
been going on since April 1992.

Their first step will be a cru-
cial task: to develop an econo-
my. This is very important
because the people of Sarajevo
will have to earn an income
again after such a long time
without one. He feels this will
be difficult because many peo-
ple were employed by indus-
tries which were very devel-
oped before the war and are
now destroyed and impossible
to renovate.

“Our educational system is

an important step, because we

need new experts as a basis for

our development,” Luckin said.

Currently in Sarajevo,
schools have been working
throughout the entire war peri-
od, but atudents are learning
under very difficult circum-
stances. Luckin said there is a
lack of teachers available in
Sarajevo because many of them
have left due to general dangers
of living there, or expulsion
from the Serbian-occupied part
of the city. He also said many
teachers are “unfortunately”
wounded.

Yet despite these obstacles,
Luckin said students are still
getting the same quality of edu-
cation as they received prior to
the war.

The current health care sys-
tem in Sarajevo is still very
well organized with the help of
the International Humanitarian
Committee. Since the begin-
ning of the war, Luckin said,
doctors and nurses have played
an important part in helping
people in difficult situations.
There have been cases of spe-
cific illnesses that could not be
treated in Sarajevo due to lack
of equipment, specialists in
related areas and medications.

“Under such difficult circum-
stances, such as shelling and
lack of energy and water, the
citizens of Sarajevo have very
sufﬁcient means of health care

Pitt Medical Center finds
key to open heart surgery

By Beth McLaughlin
For The Pitt News

Tissue engineering may
end need for organ donors

By Jennifer Haluska
For The Pitt News

Surgeons at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have found the
key to a better heart surgery. Patients with blocked heart arteries now have
the option of keyhole surgery, a technique that reduces stress and recovery
time of heart operations.

In normal bypass surgery, the chest is cut open and the breast bone is cut
in order to get to the blocked artery. With the new keyhole surgery, only
four small incisions are made.

“Hospitalization should be just a couple of days for this new procedure,
compared with five to six days for standard
open-heart surgery,” said Bartley P. Griffith,
professor of surgery and chief of cardiothoracic
surgery.

In the new technique, three small incisions are
made on the left side of the chest. A small video
camera and miniature knife are inserted into the
chest. The surgeons guide the knife by watching a
television monitor. The mammary artery is cut away
from the breast bone, inside the chest wall. A fourth
incision is made under the left breast. Surgeons then
attach the mammary artery to the heart’s left anterior
descending artery, which is an artery leading blood
from one chamber to another.

This operation is specifically for repairing blocked
left anterior descending arteries. By attaching anoth-
er artery to it, an alternative route is made for the
blood, not unlike adding a high-occupancy lane to a
highway.

So far, keyhole surgery is still in its infancy. Only about 25 people have

 ~ undergone this surgery nationwide, and only three here in Pittsburgh.

Keyhole surgery has been used for other critical surgeries, such as for
patients with lung and esophageal cancer. A

According to Rodney Landreneau, associate professor of surgery and
head of the section of thoracic surgery at the UPMC, the pictures received
from the video camera are excellent.

“In fact,” said Landreneau, “the view of the operative field is _in many
ways improved over standard open-heart techniques.” ~

UPMC has been one of the earlier users of keyhole surgery and will con-
tinue to fine-tune the process.

“Our feeling is that if the blockage in the ‘window-maker artery’ can be
treated with a long-lasting surgical bypass, a patient’s survival can be
improved and other blockages treated with angioplasty or balloon tech-
niques,” said Dr. Griffith. “The composite keyhole bypass and angioplasty
treatment might well become a future standard.”

Each year millions of Americans suffer tissue loss or end-stage organ fail-
ure. '

While organ transplants can help these patients, with only 3,000 donors for
the 30,000 patients in need of a transplant nationwide, doctors at Pitt are try-
ing to come up with an alternative. Tissue engineering may someday be a
replacement for organ donation, offering cures for many diseases that are cur-
rently incurable, said officials of the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative.
Dr. Peter Johnson, an associate professor of surgery at Pitt. Johnson hopes to
establish Pittsburgh as a national center for tissue engi-
neermg.

“Ongoing research in this area can lead to tremendous
opportunities for both the university and the region,”
Dr. Johnson said. “We believe that artifically grown tis-
sues can be used in 35 million procedures each year,
with a potential market of $80 billion.” PTEI is bring-
ing together researchers across several medical and
computer disciplines, with the goal of making artificial-
ly grown organs and tissues to treat human disease.

Tissue engineering uses principles of both biology and
engineering to develop substitute organ tissue. Dr.
Johnson recently founded the PTEI to focus on tech-
‘ nologies in cell culturing, computer simulation, gene
therapy, and organ transplant and regeneration. PTEI is

University.

Dr. Johnson said he believes that Pittsburgh is an
excellent location to start up the PTEI for a few rea-
sons. One is Pitt’s global reputation for transplantation and another is that
Pittsburgh has a huge pool of talent in the medical and tissue engineering
field.

PTEI officials said they also hope to increase the economic potential for the
region’s firms that will be commercializing these products.

“The PTEI is attempting to unite science with business development,” said
Reed McManigle, associate director of PTEI and technology transfer special-
ist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. .

The first such company, Precision Therapeutics, started up in July of this
year and is building a business by running tests on cancer patient’s cells,
rather than on the patients themselves.

So far, the primary funding for the PTEI has come from the Ben Franklin
Technology Center, a state-sponsored economic development program. This
funding will allow PTEI to spin off a number of new firms in the future. The
PTEI directors said they hope to acquire additional funding from local foun-
dations.

The Pitt News, Tuesday, September 12, 1995

A mime tries clowning around with Al Gore's secret service agents. The

Vice President was here as part of a campaign against student aid cuts.

Rally

°Frompage1
Aid Week,’ we the students
of Pittsburgh have spoken,
and we have been heard,”
said Walters.

Many speakers stressed
that these proposals could
affect most students. Most
students at the rally raised
their hands when Gore asked

117 S. Bouquet St.

which students received
some type of aid. Sixty-three
percent of Carnegie Mellon
students and 85 percent of
Chatham students receive
aid. Gore said in his speech
that a lot of Duquesne stu-
dents take a semester off to
work for money for school.
“To put it simply, an

investment in higher educa-
tion is an investment in our
future  we should not, can-
not and will not sacrifice
education,” said Gore.
Nearly 10,000 students
came to the rally, both for
the issue and to hear Gore.

said, “We are not getting a
lot of aid. Also, being a
Democrat, I wanted a
chance hear him speak.
[This rally] gives a chance
for students to be heard.”

Senior Faye Malarkey
doesn’t receive any student
aid, but she attended the
rally “because I support stu-
dent aid for others and edu-
cation funding at all levels.”

Gore discussed Congress’

opposing viewpoints on the
issue but said students can
take an active part in the
,. future of student aid.
C ‘ “Once again we have the
obligation to look into the
future, think long and hard
about the kind of future we
want, and make the right
choices,” he said.

“This group in Congress
 has to be made to under-
 stand with the help of your
 voices and participation in
 the political dialogue of
i America.”

Proposed changes include

reductions in Pell Grants,
Perkins Loans, student loans
and the elimination of the
 six-month grace period to
 pay back those loans after
 graduation.
5 “It doesn’t. matter. if
you’re a Democrat or a
Republican or an indepen-
dent or where you come
from,” said Gore. “This is ’a
record that benefits students
of all ages and supports life-
long learning.” '

 

 Keith Campbell, govern-

mental relations liaison for
the Student Government
Board, agreed with Gore.
“This needs to be a biparti-
san issue. We need pro-edu-
cation candidates.”

Campbell hopes this rally
will be the motivation for
all students to become
involved. “We need to get
active and must write letters
now and vote in 1996  we
need students to bring this
issue to the ﬂoor.”

 

 Protest——

says was a promise from
Gore to prevent the forma-
tion of an incinerator in
Ohio, commonly known as
Waste
Industries.

“Our main concern is that
Gore has broken his
promise,” said SEAC mem-
berSarah Kraemer. “We’ve
been extremely disappoint-
ed in this administration.”

Gore’s press secretary for
the Pitt trip said that repre-
sentatives from the vice
president’s office met with
SEAC for two hours con-
cerning their protest.

} “It was the most unpro-

ductive meeting ever,” said
Josh Knauer, also from
SEAC.

Knauer said. SEAC was
told by Gore’s representa-
tives that it could not bring
signs protesting Gore to the
front of the rally.

without having any outbreaks
of epidemics,” Luckin said.

The first thing Luckin hopes
to restructure within Sarajevo’s
health care system is providing
better facilities, because so
many buildings have been
completely or partially
destroyed.

“We also have to change the
organization of city health
care,” Luckin said, “because
we want better primary health
care of our citizens. For a long
time, citizens couldn’t pay for
health care services, so they
feel the need to eradicate and
support public health care.”

The people of Sarajevo have
grown "accustomed to living
with daily fears such as
shelling; sniping; and lack of
water, gas, electricity, food,
wood and clothes. Luckin said
his people have these fears for
the existence of themselves and
their children, who are
Sarajevo’s future.

From the contacts that
Luckin has seen throughout his
trip, he said the American peo-

ple seemed very well—infonned
about the current situation
occurring in Sarajevo.

“It is difficult for us to live in
Sarajevo and to realize that the
American government is not
efficient enough in such situa-
tions, because our civil rights
are in extreme danger,” Luckin
said. “In politics nothing is
black and white. It is clear you
must wait to meet certain con-
ditions to make things possible
so politicians can act true of
this decision.” _

Luckin said it is very difficult
to_ predict the future for Bosnia
and Sarajevo, but he also said
that “according to initiatives of
NATO airplanes, I think we can
expect a relatively quick solu-
tion.”

“When the war will finish in
Bosnia is dependent on the
solution of Sarajevo’s future,”
Luckin said.

Luckin left Pittsburgh
Saturday for Virginia, where he
will spend a few days before
going back to Washington to
end his trip and return home to

the property under owner-
ship and utilize its space
most effectively.”

The plans for a new CBA
building were first proposed
as part of the Master Space
Plan, a document filled with
Pitt’s construction plans for
the next 20 years. The
Master Space Plan is also
involved in the long—range
plan for the university,
known as “Toward the 21st
Century.”

In November of 1994, the
city Planning Commission
approved the Master Space
Plan. However, a month
earlier, Pitt’s board of
trustees refused to
endorse any construction
project proposed in the mas-
ter plan, including the CBA
building.

A major fund—raising cam-
paign, which sought to raise
$30 million in funds for
construction of the CBA
building, has been suspend-
ed since the fall of 1993. To
date, Pitt has raised less
than $2 million of the $30
million it projected.

Despite the slow rate at
which funds are currently
being raised, Zoffer said it’s
nothing to be concerned
about.

“$30 million was the
goal,” he said. “I am
hopeful and confident
that we will reach some-
where around that once the
campaign is put into high
gear.”

One building that is cur-
rently being looked at to
house the CBA is the
Masonic Temple. Zoffer
said that this building may
provide the CBA with an
already existing facility and

make a new building unnec— A

essary.

“The building is being
looked at,” he said. “It is a
very large building, and it is
now being determined if
there is enough space, or if
it will be economical to
bring it up to code for the
school.”

The CBA has already
enrolled its first class,
which consists of 155 stu-
dents. According to Zoffer,
the school is expecting that
figure to grow through stu-
dent transferral into the pro-
gram.

Zoffer is also expecting a
larger class next year and
doesn’t believe the current
delay will hurt next year’s
recruitment.

“I think at the time last
year, uncertainty in the
beginning of recruitment
may have hurt last year’s
class. However, I think the
commitment of the universi-
ty is evident, and high
school students will see
that.

“It takes a while to let
people know Pitt is in
the businesses, but I feel
once they realize this
and that we maintain a
high standard, the number
of students will steadily
grow.”

that it would be better to
have class run this way than
for them to go two hours a
day, five times a week,”
Zellers said.

Students had differing
opinions about the new plan.

Alyssa Austin, a sopho-
more majoring in education,
thought that the idea of a
new summer program was a
good one.

“I think that the option
should be open for students
who are interested in pursu-
ing summer course work,”
she said. “If it were open to
students on a more ﬂexible
schedule, one that they
could work around, more
students would pursue it.”

Another student, Andrea
Black, a sophomore in the
College of Arts and
Sciences, took classes here
last summer term and had
the opposite view.

“The idea of shortening
the term and covering so
much material is inconceiv-
able to me,” she said. “In
one course I took, you need-
ed time to develop thoughts,
and with the shorter term
given in the intercession, I
don’t see how you could do
that.” ‘

Zellers said that students
should not overwhelm them-
selves with too many credits
during the shorter sessions
of the summer term.

“These compressed cours-
es aren't meant to be a full-
time 15- ‘credit basis,” she
said. “It’s for those who
want to or need to concen-
trate on a specific course,
for those who need a couple
of credits to maintain their
status as, say, a junior, or
possibly for students who
need to take one more
course before graduating.”
Students who want to take
high course loads will still
be able to do so during the
longer sessions.

If all goes well, Zellers
said, she expects after a cou-
ple of years that students
will hone in on certain

A courses and times, making

others obsolete, thus stream-
lining the program.

But it’s still up to the fac-
ulty and departments to
decide what schedules are
right for them. They will
begin rescheduling new pro-
grams in mid-fall.

Strike a pose, AI

What do you call a plane full of politicians crashing and
sinking to the bottom of the ocean? A good start. You may
have heard this one, but yesterday Pitt got a prime glimpse
atjust how true it is.

Vice President Al Gore visited the university yesterday,
as most of you probably know, as part of a week-long rally
to “Save Student Aid.” He was greeted by almost 10,000
spectators on the Cathedral Lawn, many holding signs,

chanting or cheering.

Many of the signs people held were made at a poster
party held by the Student Government Board. Some of them
included witty little tidbits like: “Talk is cheap but educa-
tion isn’t;” Ironically, this little saying was just as applica-
ble to yesterday’s rally as it was to the proposed education
cuts. ‘

The rally took an interesting twist when Gore arrived to
chants of “Don’t let Newt give us the boot.” That chant was
an accurate foreshadow of what was to come. This kind of
thing continued thrpughout the rally and accomplished
nothing but cl6udi’ng the true importance of what was being
said — don’t cut student aid. Student aid is not a partisan
issue, and, ideally, should not even be a political one.

The point of the rally was to discuss the proposed cuts in
federal student aid. Great. This is a point almost everyone
can agree on. It doesn’t matter what political party you are
a member of, most of us benefit from some kind of student
aid. It is highly unlikely that any of us would be willing to
return our checks to the government with notes that said
“No thanks, I’m not from your party, so I don’t want the
money.”

For quite some time, Gore restrained from throwing in the
expected digs at the current Republican-majority Congress.
But then the political buzzwords started ﬂying, and finally
he just couldn’t resist blaming the Republican Party by
name. In fact, the substance of Gore’s speech was little
more than bad jokes and bastardized colloquialisms.
(“Scratch my back with a chain saw”???)

- Now, we would be naive to think that an event like this
would not include some amount of political partisanship.
Campaign mode has set in, and after all, the election is only
14 months away. But with an issue so important to students

' of all beliefs, Gore turned what could have been a very per-

suasive and motivating speech into mere political postur-
mg.

_ It is important to follow the few pieces of sound advice
given during yesterday’s speeches: Take action, don’t sit
passively and accept things you disagree with. Register to
vote and make your voice heard at the polls. Write letters or
call your local senators and representatives and let them
know you are against cuts in student aid.

But whatever you do, do it because you believe it is right,
not because it is a politically partisan issue. Politicians
need to realize that not everything needs to be divided
according to party lines, and student aid is one of those

,_ issues. “Save Student Aid,” but leave the propaganda out of

It.

Gore hits nail on the head

t is now

Ben Imy turn to
Jackson eat hum-
ble pie.

Despite the fact that all of the
current agenda was laid out in
a “Mein Kampf”-like tome,
there were those of us who
didn’t vote against this current
madness. We complacent
masses who sat by thinking
‘94 was an off-year election
and that very little would
change were obviously wrong.
It is time to contain the dam-
age we have wrought. '

The issue which has awak-
ened a large portion of the

country to the threat of com-

placency is student aid.
Yesterday’s rally evidenced
this. Vice President Al Gore’s
speech has been denounced as
partisan posturing and lacking
both substance and real con-
cern for student aid. This has
mostly come from those who
either went in with bias or who
were not there for the whole
speech.

The first thing to adduce is
the substance of the speech.
The goal of this rally was to
motivate students, and the
general public, to make their
voices heard about cuts to stu-
dent aid. The Vice President’s
speech encouraged people to
contact their representatives in
Congress and voice their
opposition to the cuts.
Everyone who has an interest
in the future of the country
ought to do so.

Only the education of this
country’s citizenry will insure
its viability in the future.
Instead of seeking a return to a
garrison state through larger
defense budgets and more law
enforcement, we should be
developing a nation of free
thinkers who can bargain with
circumstance. This will protect
the country more than ineffec-
tive weapons to be deployed
against non-existent threats.

It is odd to hear that the
answer to every problem is
education and see so little sup-
port for it. Whenever trouble

rears its ugly head, the cry is
always about educating peo-
ple. Educate against the dan-
gers of drugs; teach children
family values; warn people
about the threat of AIDS. Yet,
when the chips are down,
money is the final considera-
tion. The value of education,
however, as one of the student
speakers noted, goes beyond
dollars and cents.

The question of our priori-
ties must not be answered with
short-range goals in mind.
Rather, a sensitivity to com-
plex situations must be
employed in order to deal with
them effectively. This cannot
be done with partisan postur-
ing and platitudes.

These very accusations were
laid at the feet of the Vice
President. He was non-partisan
in his speech, addressing the
issues in regards to the actions
which the audience could take.
It is impossible to oppose an
agenda laid out by a group of
people without opposing them,
but it is possible to try to effect
change without scapegoating.
The tone of the speech was
exactly this: instead of laying
responsibility for what was
happening at anyone’s
doorstep, the Vice President
put the responsibility on the
audience members to oppose
what they know is pernicious
to the country.

Examining what was actual-
ly said, the audience members
were encouraged to contact
members of Congress in order
to support those who were
opposing cuts and to persuade
those who authored them to
change their opinions. Gore
posed the question in the cor-
rect terms: to whom are
Congressmen beholden, and
whose interests are they repre-
senting? While only a minority
of the American people actual-
ly voted for the “group in
Congress” which is there now,
they now represent the country
as a whole. Just because you
didn’t vote for them doesn’t
make them any less responsi-

ble to you.

Was this just a mere publici-
ty stunt? Those who make this
claim don’t realize that politics
is about publicity. Informing
the people and allowing them
to express their opinion based
upon accurate information is
necessary for a democracy.

Ultimately, the message of
the rally is the same regardless
of the Vice President’s atten-
dance or motives. The purpose
of his appearance was to show
that there are elements within
the government who do
oppose this attempt to destroy
America. His appearance lent
weight to an occasion which
was already necessary. The
students in attendance know
that it is not the government
which is their enemy, but
rather the apathy which has
allowed these proposals to
come as far as they have.

If you didn’t attend the rally,
don’t believe everything you
hear or read about it. If you
did, consider what was really
said. The message is clear:
contact the members of
Congress who claim to repre-
sent you and make your opin-
ion heard. Contact the con-
gressional leadership directly,
in addition to your own mem-
bers. They set legislative
goals. Try
georgia6@hr.house.gov to
reach Gingrich himself. The
computing lab consultants can
help you contact other govern-
ment officials. Regardless of
how you do it — e-mail, let-
ters, phone calls — oppose
these cuts to the cornerstone of
America’s future. Finally,
remember to vote. As the
speaker from Community
College of Allegheny County
said, “Talk is cheap, but edu-
cation is not.” Educate your-
selves about the true nature of
the issue, and then educate
your government by voting -
not for a party, but for what
you believe in.

You better

come to
the Pitt -
Ohio State

game

V s I grow
Columnist older
Mike and

Kovak older, I look
back with the

fondest of memories to the

days when I was 4 years old.

See, back then I loved foot— 1
ball with a ﬁery passion
unknown to most people my
age. I loved football so much I
actually devoutly followed
Pitt AND Penn State.

Unlike many children of
this generation, my father was
there to set me straight at the
tender age of four.

He said, “Son, you’re now a
man old enough to make deci-
sions on your own. It is now .
time to make a decision that
will forever change your life.

He wasn’t referring to a
small vanilla, chocolate or
twist ice cream cone, and he
wasn’t talking about choosing
soccer or baseball to play dur-
ing the summer.

My dad knew that I could
not like botliPitt and Penn 0
State. This is simply not
acceptable in a contemporary
Pennsylvanian lifestyle.

I wrestled with this decision
for weeks. Both schools had
things going for them.

Penn State had Curt Warner.
Warner eluded opposing
defenses so easily. Jack Ham
attended Penn State. My
cousin, Chuck Fusina, started 5'
at quarterback for Penn State.
Plus, PSU fans had me con-
vinced that the sky shone blue
and white because God loved
the Nittany Lions.

Pitt had Dan Marino. I can
remember Dan throwing at
least 15 touchdown passes
every game. Pitt had Hugh
Green, who was unquestion-
ably the best college defen-
sive player ever. Pitt had
Rickey Jackson, who never
got the attention he deserved
because of Green. Pitt also
held the number one ranking
quite frequently during those
years.

Against the wishes of the
Kovak family, I choose Pitt.

The clincher was the fans.
The Pitt fans, that is. Never in
my life had I witnessed such a
wild pack of screaming,
drunken, loud and obnoxious
fans. The fans loved their
Panthers, and the Panthers
loved their fans. _

Hundreds and hundreds of
blue-and-gold towels waved
everywhere. Thousands of‘
people painted themselves.
Pitt was a power, and its fans
helped them reach that status.

Not many teams can go 1-2
over the course of a weekend

into the Ball State Classic
with a 2-2 record and hopes
of coming out 5-2, or at least
4-3. Things did not go as well
as they had hoped, losing to
Ball State and Pacific, but
coach Cindy Alvear is not
worried about her team at
this point in the season.

In fact, Alvear hopes
to use -this start to the
team’s advantage.

“I am not disappoint-
ed at all about our record
at this point,” Alvear said.
“I know how good we will
be,. based on the talent we
have. I wish that it would
come faster than it has
been so far, but it will all
fall into place. The kids are
learning with these losses
and are getting better.”

first match of the tourna-

Men finish fourth,

women eighth at Miami
cross country invite

By Geoff Moak
For The Pitt News

Despite some surprises, new coach Dave Sobal saw
some encouraging signs at the first meet of the season for
the Pitt men’s and women’s cross country teams.

The men went to Miami University (Ohio) expecting to
find a fairly flat course, Sobal said. But, Miami’s rolling
hills apparently didn’t phase them.

Ball State won the men’s competition with 33 points.
Pitt placed fourth out of 11 teams with 83 points, only 11
behind second-place Miami.

Pitt’s Frank Nesko came in third place in the race after
spending much of the race fighting for the lead.

“He was right up with the leaders until about the last
1,500 meters,” Sobal said.

Nesko finished with a time of 25:28, 16 seconds behind
Ball State’s Kyle Baker, who won the race.

The rest of the Panthers also ran well.

“They ran well, a good race, close together,” Sobal said.

The gap from Pitt’s top runner to the fifth runner was
46 seconds.

“That was great,” Sobal said.

Adding to the excitement were twofreshmen, Julio
Ortez and Scott Gilpin, who finished among Pitt’s top
five runners, with times of 26:02 and 26:06.

On top of all the good news, the Panthers ran without
several runners who Sobal said he believes will “mix it
up” and add challenge the top runners on the team.

Sobal summed up the squad by saying, “This team has a
lot of depth.”

The first surprise of the day for the women was seeing
the team from the University of Michigan at the meet.

kills.

Juniors Mindy Stanley and
Wendy Carter" carried the
load for Ball State. Stanley
finished the match with 19
kills while Carter added 12.

Freshman Becky Inman was ‘

another bright spot for the
Lady Cardinals, finishing the
match with eight kills and
only two errors.

Saturday began with a
matchup against the tough
University of the Pacific. The
Lady Panthers fell to Pacific
in three straight games, 15-2,
15-12 and 15-8.

Despite the sweep, Alvear
was happy with the play of
the team against such a diffi-
cult opponent.

“Pacific is a great team and
I was pleased with our
effort,” Alvear said. “Due to
some injuries we were put
into somewhat of a bind. At
one point in the match we
had all five freshmen on the
court at once. They made
mistakes that they will not
make down the line. It is
tough to go through the
growing pains with a squad,
but we’re obviously right
there in terms of progress.”

Freshman outside hitter
Jennifer Keister and Mitchell
each had eight kills for the
Lady Panthers.

Pacific was led by Rebecca
Downey and Do Benton-
Bozman, each with 14 kills.
Elsa Stegemann added 12

Two ‘Huskers arrested,
Heisman candidate

Phillips kicked off team

Nebraska’s star running back and leading Heisman
Trophy candidate Lawrence Phillips was arrested
Sunday for allegedly assaulting his ex-girlfriend and
was thrown off the football team.

He was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor third-
degree assault.

Lt. Kent Woodhead said Phillips allegedly hit the
woman inside and outside her Lincoln apartment. The

. woman was not seriously injured or hospitalized.

Phillips turned himself over to police at about 8:15
p.m and was released 45 minutes later on 10 percent of a
$1,000 bond. '

“He is very, very upset with himself,” his attorney, Hal
Anderson, said. “He’s very disappointed with himself —
whether he’s guilty or not —— with having been arrested.”

Prior to his arrest, Phillips had been the target of an
NCAA investigation for having .lunch with an employee
of California sports agent Steve Feldman. He was
cleared to play before the season began.

He is still being investigated for two other incidents,
including a 1995 Mustang convertible he had been dri-
ving. The NCAA withheld the other issue.

“We have told all our players that abusive behavior
such as this will not be tolerated,” head coach Tom
Osborne said. “Lawrence has been under a great deal of
pressure recently with the NCAA investigation and with
the public scrutiny of his childhood, and this may or
may not have had some bearing on his actions.”

Phillips, a junior, had accumulated 359 yards and
scored seven touchdowns in the first two games of the
season.

As a sophomore, he helped lead the Cornhuskers to
their first national championship under Osborne by rush-

Sports Editor  ' I T I  1 ‘ i "  

“ The biggest question after Pitt’s game against Washington

State was, “Who’s gonna run the ball?”

That question was answered in the first Panther drive against
the Eastern Michigan Eagles last Saturday.
I With Billy West out for the game, it was up to senior Chris

Patton and true—freshman Demetrius Harris to handle the load. ‘

Throughout most of the first half, the two alternated backfield
duties, opening many eyes in the process.

’ “The last two games [Harris] really stepped it up. I’m actually
real surprised,” quarterback John Ryan said. “He hasn’t really
struggled in practice, but he’s just a true freshman and to be able
to step in and contribute that much is a real achievement.”

' “Harris did some excellent things, and Patton ran hard,”
Majors said. “We picked up the slack with Billy West being out

‘of the game. I think that’s a credit to the offensive staff and
especially the players who executed the game plan.”

A Coming into the game, Patton had a total of 27 career carries
‘fora total of 142 yards. Against the Eagles, he practically cut
those numbers in half — 12 carries for 53 yards.

To counter Patton’s straight-ahead, bruising style of running,
‘ Pitt was able to counter with a quick slasher in Harris.
“Me and Chris Patton did a good job,” Harris said. “He’s more

“I never thought that I would get this much playing time coming in,”
Harris said. “I figured I’d get maybe one or two carries at the end of the
game, just to see how college feels and get ready for the next year. It’s a
shock to me, but I’m glad I’m answering it well.

“I try to think about contributing my part as a running back to the team,”
Harris added. “It starts with good blocking up front by the linemen getting
a good seam or a crease just to hit. I do that pretty good.”

Miami

°From page 9

Michigan was the No. 2
team in the nation last sea-
son and was ranked third
in the preseason. However,
several of Michigan’s top
runners were left at home,
and its 68 points were sec-
ond to Eastern Kentucky’s
51.

Pitt’s women finished
well behind those teams, in
eighth place out of 11
teams with 205 points, but
Sobal was not discouraged.

“I can’t help but compare
this team with teams I’Ve
had in the past,” he said.
“This team is definitely
stronger than what I’ve
had.”

The women did have
their share of problems.

“We had some gaps. We
just need to run a more
intelligent race,” Sobal
said.

Unlike the men, the
women had a significant
gap between their runners
— 37 seconds between just
the first two runners,
Stacey Anderson (18:48)
and Stephanie Ellsworth
(19:25). Michelle Slater of
Michigan won the race in
18:01.

Most of the women were
close to their best times
from a year ago. Still,
Sobal is looking for
improvement.

“What you see is what
you get,” Sobal said about
the women. “‘It’s up to
them to improve now.”

Sobal, in his first year
coaching Pitt’s cross coun-
try teams, came here from
Christopher Newport
University in Newport
News, Va. His team there
was ranked No. 3 in the
nation in Division III cross
country last season. Sobal
played down the jump to
Division I, calling
Saturday’s race “just
another cross country
meet,” but he added that
“the competition is a lot
better here.”

The Panthers return
home this Saturday for
what Sobal called “a low-
key meet” at Schenley
Park.

°From page 9

By the time I started here in
1992, things had changed dra-
matically. Games became a
place to go before the bars or a
party. Sure, the fans were
drunk and obnoxious, but they
were more concerned with
what the opposite sex was or
wasn’t wearing than what was
going on with the game.

Who could blame them?

The team that annually con-
tended for a national title just
went through three seasons in
which they won a total of nine
games.

There is a different smell
emanating from the air this
year, however, and it’s not the
chili.

From the moment Pitt
walked onto the field against
Washington State, everybody
could sense something. This

-team not only wants to win,

but now it has the confidence

to go out there and do it.
Throughout the game the

student section did its best

imitation of the PSU students.
I saw very few spectators
leave, and the team treated
them to the most thrilling
game at Pitt Stadium in recent
memory.

The most special moment
came after the game. As cheer-
leader Sadiq Durham danced
and jived with the student sec-
tion, the players remained on
the field. The entire crowd
stayed and chanted, “Let’s go
Pitt! Let’s go Pitt!”

Shivers went through my
body. I couldn’t believe it, was
this really happening? For
years, dreams danced through _
my head about moments like
these.

The game against Eastern
Michigan would prove the
worth of these fans.

Only 200 fewer people
showed up for Pitt’s crushing
of EMU than for the season
opener. Despite the blowout,
about half the fans stayed for

Either there are not as many
parties this year, or the stu-
dents are actually starting to
care.

This leads to my concern.
What happens if Pitt loses to
Texas on Saturday? Will these
ﬁckle fans show up against
Ohio State in two weeks? Q

The answer had better be a
resounding “YES!”

For the last seven years or
so, the university that we
attend has become a laughing-
stock. A laughingstock to
PSU, WVU, Syracuse and
Ohio State —— basically the
entire sports country. It has
become embarrassing to tell
people I went here.

Things can change. The
players are doing their best to
change things. They are unde-
feated, and they have a general
excitement about them that is
contagious. What’s not to like
about this team? They are fun
to watch.

Come Sept. 23, Pitt fans

the entire game.

they belong back in the elite
ranks of college football.

Ohio State is not far away,
and their fans are among the
elite. If you fans don’t get to
the game and show your sup-
port, the stadium will be filled
with Buckeye fans. That's why
people have been laughing at
us for so long.

So for three hours, forget
about beer and go to the game
in two Saturdays. If you don’t
get a ticket, crash the gate or
jump from Sutherland Hall.
Paint yourselves blue and gold
like those crazy guys down in
the front row of the student
section. Get really drunk
before the game, and go there
and scream your heart out.
Run on the field after the game
if Pitt wins — the cops won't
be able to arrest everybody.

It’s time we can chant “Penn
State sucks” and know that
we’re better than them._

kills to the Pacific effort.

“When you have a good
number of freshmen on a
team, you are always identi-
fying new personalities,”
Alvear said. ‘‘I like what I'm
seeing, and they‘re getting to
the point where they are
about to crank it up.”

Pitt faced the University of
Kansas in their final match of
the tournament and left with
a convincing win, 15-13. 15-
ll and 15-12. Mitchell and
Keister again led the way for
Pitt with 13 and 12 kills
respectively.

Alvear noticed something
she liked during this win.

“We were solidly ahead in
each game against Kansas.
We are maturing very quick-
ly, in fact, faster than I had
expected,” Alvear said. “This
was a tough group of match-
es, but I’d rather go through
the fire now than later in the
year.”

Alvear is sure that the team
knows the value of facing
tough competition early and
building on that. The compe-
tition does not let up next
weekend as the Lady
Panthers visit sunny
California for the Loyola
Marymount Tournament. Pitt
faces Sacramento State on
Friday along with Baylor and
LMU on Saturday.

ing for 1,722 yards.

“We will do everything we
can to help him get his life
back together, but he is dis-
missed from the football
team effective immediately,”
Osborne said.

Phillips wasn’t the only
player to be arrested over
the weekend.

In a separate incident, No.
2 running back Damon
Benning was arrested at 2
a.m. Saturday on suspicion
of misdemeanor assault.
Lincoln police said that
Benning confronted a 19-
ycar-old woman who went to
his apartment to retrieve per-
sonal belc-ngings. She told
police a verbal confrontation
turned physical and Benning
grabbed her around the
throat and pushed her.

Benning’s status with the
team was yet to be deter-
mined.

He missed last Saturday's
game at Michigan State
because of a pulled ham-
string. In Nebraska’s first
game against Oklahoma
State, he rushed eight times
for 62 yards.

Phillips and Benning are
the second and third
Nebraska football players to
be arrested this season.
