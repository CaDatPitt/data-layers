  SG Constitution Referendum

'V‘\,
\~.

Postponed

The: student referendum
on the new Student Govern-
ment (SG) Constitution
will be held in September in-
stead of this term, accord-
ing to SG- Senator Terry.
Hyman, chairman of the Consti-
tutional‘ Commmittee.

“The basic reason for chang-
ing the date centers around the
idea of student participation.”
Hyman emphasized. “Student
Government built up a certain
amount of stature during the
last two administrations," he ad-
ded. “A poor turnout would les-

f‘$,«sen our importance in the eyes

of the administration and the
University community.

“Moreover, an uneducated turn-
out would lessen the importance
of the Constitution,” Hyman add-
ed. He deﬁned an
turnout” as people voting without
fully understanding the improve-
ments in the new Constitution

and the -new role which SG will

ﬁx, play.

Hyman pointed out that “the
constitutional rererendum is to
provide not only a structure with-
in which students may communi-
cate better with the administra-
tion and the faculty, but also an
opportunity for students to fully.
understand the necessity and the
value. of an active Student Gov-

ernment, To put it simply, we
want students to know VVHY SG
should exist and how it can im-
prove th-e status of the student
on campus.” “ H

“President Manning, other
members of the Constitutional

Committee, and '1 agree that this’

type of understanding for SG
cannot be conveyed in one week,”
Hyman stated. “Thus, we feel we
should delay the constitution un-
til next fall.

' Hyman listed four main rea-
sons for the decision to postpone
the referendum: the organizations

Trimester

that are affected have not had '
the opportunity to fully consider
the entire Constitution, which
was passed only a week ago; final
exams will hold the vote down;
“We’d rather initiate freshmen
with a feeling of participation in
student affairs instead of trying
to convince seniors with one week
of school left that they still have
a responsibility to the Univer-
sity”; and “we want to sell not
only the idea of a new constitu-
tion, but the idea of student in-
volvement in student affairs.”

Hyman’s reference to the or-
ganization affected dealt withthe
seven organizations that are‘ cur-
rently represented in SG with
senatorial positions for their re-

' spective vice-presidents.

In defending the idea of de-
laying the referendum, SG Presi-
dent Ralph Manning emphasized
“We campaigned on the issue of
student involvement during the

_ last SG election. By holding the

referendum this late in the term,
we’re really not satisfying the
students’ appetite -for student in-
volvement, since it is so close to
finals.”

Although the referendum will
not be held, until the fall term,
copies of the SG Constitution will
be available to students before
the end of this term.

 French UN Representative Outlines
France’s Objections To NATO  

By ALAN DISLER
Monsieur J. N. de Bouil-
lane de Lacoste, secretary to
the permanent French dele-
gation to the United Nations,

outlined his government's objec-

l

ax.

tions to the NATO military or-
ganization at the International
Relations Club’s discussion on the
NATO alliance entitled, “NATO:
Can It Exist?” last Friday in the
Frick auditorium. ‘

Dr. Daniel S. Cheever, asso-
ciate professor of international
affairs and political science at the
-University's Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs,
presented an opposing View in
an informal debate.

De Lacoste explained that
France “does not question the
Alliance” as a principle, but is
critical of the physical organiza-
tions of-collective defense. France
is not about “to ask for revision
of the Alliance,” said de Lacoste.
“We will not renounce it because
we are still within the Western
Community," he added.

According to de Lacoste-, France
contends that the military organi-
zation as it was originally set up

."‘is no longer necessary,” that it _
.is “in efficientin a nuclear con.
“no longer accept-

-__.

  

ﬂict.” and is
_  . . n

   

    

from the East is no longer as it
was 15 years ago. We no longer
have a situation in which the
USSR would have. troops ready
for an attack in western Europe.

The Soviet Union is not as it was .

in Stalin’s time.

“There is no longer an Eastern
bloc,” he added. “The commun-
ist countries of eastern Europe
are becoming, riiore aloof from
Moscow as they seek to satisfy
their respective national interests.
Also, the USSR generally rec-
ognizes the need to peacefully
coexist with the West.”

De Lacoste also cited what he
termed the “MacNamara Doc-
trine” for the defense of Europe,
whereby a conventional attack
on Europe would be answered
by conventional retaliation from
the West. “This system limits the
us; of weapons,” he said. “We
would be.the battleground and
we don’t like it. The only deter-

rent is knowledge that nuclear.

weapons will immediately an-
swer any attack. That is -why
France is building her own nu-
clear force.”

Dr. Cheever said that differed
with de Lacoste in that he be-
lieved NATO should be given nu-

clear arms -and that all NATO‘
i_ mfbmbersvbe given an equal voice

colleges, wh

     

tive nuclear defense is
tical.

Dr. Cheever stated that “when
Britain and the United States in-_
sist upon control, it cannot be an
alliance of equal partners.” He
said that the United States is
trying to correct “the psycholog-
ical inequality” with various pro-
posals; the Multi Lateral Force,
for example. “The smaller na-
tions would be reassured in build-
ing up the organization than in
tearing it down,” he stated.

(See Editorial —— Page Four) A
Professors Charles Crow and Lawrence Lee of‘ 1..
partment of English will edit a book of poems entitled, Cath‘
edral Poets I. All writings included in the volume will be se-
lected works by members of the University communityﬁ,
Because in the editor’s views, “art is a non-sectarian
reverence for the nature of men and things,” Cathedra

Poets I is meant to carry the
theme of an affirmation of hu-

’man existence rather than a dis-

gust for life.

“We feel that many people feel
a reverence toward this world
and mankind,” noted Professor
Lee, “as opposed to the recent

protestors and calamity how1ers.” ‘

The book is entitled Cathedral
Poets, not only because the Cath-
edral of Learning is a central
symbol of the University, but be-
cause of more abstract reasons.

“The late Chancellor Bowman,”
noted Professor Lee, “tried to
bring back the idea of learning
as it once existed with the re-

Vligious men of the Middle Ages,

We may not have the same views
of dogma‘, but like such people,
we feel that human existence is
reverential and art is an expres-
sion of such insight.”

spy themes in today's ﬁction and movies is purely for com-
mercial success. Actually spies are p0D11131' materlal these

is the opinion (if Klaus Geshloten, Head of the University’s
newly-formed Department of Espionage.

1 “Governments all over der vorld» are looking for goot
college-trained spies,” he said in a recent
interview. “Und dey are villing to pal’ fer
dem!”

JIE RAN a meaty hand through his
white hair and puffed on the roll of carbon
paper he was smoking, a habit acquired dur-
ing the cigarette shortage of the last war.
“Ve vant dis department to become der
best; to produce der really vell-rounded
spy.”

He was about to explain how this was
'jV~to‘be done when his red telephone rang and the interrup-
tion enabled me to look around his office. Actually there
was nothing to distinguish this office from any other in the
University, except that we were sitting ten feet beneath
Fifth Avenue, and that I had found it by accidently falling
into one of the smokey manholes in the sidewalk.

“DOT VAS der Chancellor on der shcrambler phone,”
he said, hanging up. “Nice fellow. I know everything about
him.”

‘ “Dr. Geshloten, how will the training of Espionage ma-
jors differ from other programs?” T '

“Vell in der ﬁrst place, no matter vat course der spy
— student decides to take he will be expected to cheat on der
exams. In fact if he doesn’t he will be ﬂunked! And der
. A really goot student villéglackmail der instructor. Dot’s der
. major difference.” '

“What about scholarship?”

“VELL, OF COURSE‘ ve have a little money for our
_ needy students, but dey got to vork for it! I keep it for my-
self und if dey vant it dey got to take it off me!”

“Will you offer a distribution course?”

“But, of course! Ve are a part of der school just like
any von else. Der distribution coui'se gives der survey of
, espionage. Ve vill teach der sliabotage, der burglary, und
-V '_der love making.”

““With a lab of course.”

“NO, BUT DER homework will be fun.”

“Do you recommend this course for everyone?”
“Certainly. No matter vat job you take in life it pays
to know how to be a sneak. Der math you never use. Who
cares about der natives of Bago-Bago. But der underhanded
‘methods never get forgot. But now you got to excuse me. I
got to give a test to my buggling class and I got to be
around to throw out any one who knews der material.

450 Student

Question Raised
Editor, ‘The Pitt News:
I can not help but reply to Dr.
Kurtzman’s recent column in_The
Pitt News in which he explains

' how academic quality will not be

affected by the University becom-
ing state-related. I fully under-
stand how quality students may
be admitted and how their ad-
mittance may be added by addi-
tional funds, lower tuition, and
increased scholarship programs.
But, can Dr. Kurtzman answer
the following question?‘ Where
shall we put those additional stu-
dents?

Quality education is not sim-
ply based on student quality but
on teaching quality as well. Shall
class size increase, shall more
freshman women live in the
Nurses’ Residency Halls, shall the
University become even more de-
personalized as the student body
increases in size?

It is not unusual that the ad-
ministration should think of
money——of the $450 question. But
isn’t the real issue a 450 “stu-
dent” question. And, Dr.iKurtz-
man, won’t it be considerably
more than 450? These are the
questions that are “bugging” me.

I do not know to whom to

the University at 7 p.m.; the tele-

merely taken off the hook. Un-

the phone rang 51 times and my

I did not complain. I previous-

Students for Peace,

SDS Defined
Editor, The Pitt News:

Student Government Vice-Pres-
ident Howard Ainisman has noted
that Students for Peace, a cam-
pus group, is working with Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society
(SOS), an off-campus group. He
(SDS), an ‘off-campus group. He
has also expressed an ignorance
of “the position and nature” of
SDS. We would li.ke to enlighten
him.

,SDS is a national organization
with over 100- chapters and 4,000

members throughout the country.
It is primarily a student group,

although SDS is also involved in I

such things as community organ-
izing in poverty areas. To des-
cribe its “position” in three
words, it is: radical, democratic,

humanistic. To quote from the .

preamble of the SDS constitution:
“It maintains a vision of a demo-
cratic society, where at all lev-
els the people have control of
the decisions which affect them

and the resources on which they -
are dependent. It seeks relevance

through the continual focus on
realities and on the programs
necessary to effect change at the
most basic levels of economic,
political, and social organization.
It feels that urgency to put forth
a radical, democratic program
whose methods‘ embody the dem-
ocratic vision.” _
Students for Peace, although
holding many similar assump-
tions has a considerably narrow-

er scope than SDS.- It is an inde- '

pendent organization that be-
lieves because both East and
West have pursued foreign po-
licies which are not in the inter-
est of -their own «people or the
people of the world, that both
bear, major responsibilities -for
the Cold War. Therefore, Stu-'
dents for Peace believes that the
peace movement must’ act in.
dependently of both East and
West, must apply the same Stan.
dards or criticism to both, and
must seek a,new and creative
means of achieving a free and
peaceful society.

As for Mr. Ainisman’s charge
that Students for Peace “could
be” a front group for SDS, this
is truly foolish. Students for
Peace has existed for well. over
a year. The Pittsburgh chapter
of SDS is ﬁve months old. While
many members of Students for
Peace are also in SDS, they were
members of Students for Peace
ﬁrst. . . . And SDS is not a front
group for Students for Peace.

It is true, of course, that SDS
and _Students,.. for.) Peace) hapver
 WQrkins',.»,iI1‘c1ose ceépere

- _ tion in opposing the war in'Viet-

nam. They will probably C011‘
tinue to do so, for they have com-
mon attitudes concerning the
war. Although Students for Peace
is not affiliated with any nation-
al organization, it reserves the
right to work toward common
goals with other groups.

If these facts upset Mr. Ainis-
man, we humbly apologize.

Finally, we are pleased to see
what seems to be a trend toward
liberalization of regulations at
Pitt and look forwardlto a time——~
in the very near future——when
SDS and a variety of other
groups, left, right, ‘and center,
can attain the status of recog-

nized campus organization, pro- _

viding a truly free market place‘
of ideas on the University of
Pittsburgh campus.

Concert Attendence,

Coverage Criticized
Editor, The Pitt News:

As music lovers and partici- ,

pants in the programming of the
Antioch String Quartet by the

-Student Union Board Fine Arts

Committee last Thursday night,
we were appalled at the Pitt
News coverage of the program
which resulted in a poor turn-
out. The Pitt News had shown
interest in the program and im-
plied they would cover it before
the performance. Instead, there
was a small article on the last

page of- Wednesday’s paper. No 

advertisement was put in the
paper because the Student.Uni0n
Board thought that the program
would be precovered.

A The only interest shown, how-
ever, was by an errant photo-
grapher (perhaps associated with
your paper?) who wandered in
toward the middle of Mozart’s
“Quartet in G Major.” He pro-
ceeded to take two pictures stand-.
ing on a chair in the middle sec-
tion' of the ballroom in the midst

of the sparse audience and then‘ '

trotted out.

Although over 200- invitations
had been sent out to faculty and
students, only 50 people showed
up (including one lady who
snored). The. program which in-
cluded selections from Mozart,
Barber, Bartok was greatly en-
joyed by those few attending. It
is a shame that more students
and faculty didn't take advantage
of this cultural opportunity; I

Discuss Ballet

On the American Scene

BRUCE MARCKS (1.) and Toni Lander of the American Ballet The-

ater, discuss the merits of American ballet at Monday’s- Coffee Hour.

By BERNI McLEOD

Despite limited govern-
ment support, limited popu-
lar support, and a short his-
torical tradition, American
ballet is often superior to
European dance, noted Toni
Lander and Bruce Marcks,
principal dancers for the

American Ballet Theatre at a
coffee hour Monday.

During the informal discussion,
the Danish-born Miss Lander, and

‘Marcks, her American-born hus-

band, spoke on the conditions of
ballet in both America and Eur-
ope. A '

Marcks noted that ballet is ex-
tremely popular in Denmark and
unlike the United States has the
social status of opera in America.
Also unlike the American, the
ﬁnest and most applauded Dan-
ish dancers are male.

Established and aided by gov-
ernment support, European bal-
let has suffered because of this
very security that surrounds it.
“The real excitement in the dance
world,” noted Marcks, -“has re-’
cently come from the Unit-ed
States and its choreographers.”

“People have always been so
subservient to the master Rus-
sian technique of dance,” added
Miss Lander. “On the contrary, I

think they have found that they
can learn a lot from us.’-’ ‘

Russian dancers have always
forced movements and high and
been known for their spectacular,
energetic leaps. Miss Lander

-noted that when the American

Ballet Theatre introduced fast
movement during a tour in Rus-
sia, the people were mystified.-

“As compared to.Russia,” noted
Marcks, “American dance has a
range that Russia can’t come
close to.” American dancers are
trained not only in classical tech-
niques, but in other modes of
dance. “Even the war between
modern dance and classical bal-
let has ﬁnally_ ended.”

A perfect example of the vari-
ety in American dance is in the
program of the touring American
Ballet Theatre. The dances in-
clude “The Black Swan,” a clas-
sical ballet. from Swan Lake;
dance based on the Strindberg
“Miss Julie,” a modern-classical
play of the same name; as well
as alballet based on American
folk material.

Becauseit is not state supported,
American ballet proﬁts. No dancer
can sit back complacently with

.an assured living. “State theatre

makes artists disrespectful,”
noted Marcks. “Life is too easy.’.’

i§.iAnotiheIr. Day 

By TOM SACKS, Sports Editor

Did you ever stop to think what it would be like in the
. world the day the bomb is dropped‘? On that day all the
5 tensions and worries in the world Wlll naturally cease. The
following is a version what type of bomb it would be that

could erase all the athletic department's worries with one

blow: I
I Picture a brisk, clear day when for once the smoke from
the steel mills is being blown in the opposite direction from
* Oakland. Suddenly a siren opens up its shrill wail. In the
, next second the sky is virtually‘ split asunder revealing the
shrouded arm and hand of a beneﬁcient angel.

The inhabitants of the ﬁeld house stream out of the
closets which have been their moldy abode for many years.
. There is a gleam of fear in their eyes, but in the next instant

.~ the fear turns to joy. “Horse” Czarnecki and his crew of
‘‘ thousands race inside to gather up all the baskets they can
ﬁnd.
 For what that magnanimous hand in the sky is drop-
. ' ping are big, beautiful green things-—more commonly known
 as dollars.
. Now that the subject of money has come up, it’s time
-i to drop back to more mundane concerns. No one needs to
be told that the performance of this winter’s minor sports
,_ will never earn them a chance to lecture youths on how
 to be a winner.
' A divining rod could quickly spot the source of trouble.
So could anybody the least bit connected with University
athletics. There are simply not enough scholarships alloted

 

7Minor Sports Caught in Identity Crisis

It is the philosophy of this reporter, however, that
whether the minor teams always ﬁnish on top doesn’t make
the least bit of difference. This is still a University and not
a manufacturing plant and one of a University’s functions
is to develop a youth physically as w'ell as mentally.

For those athletes have a better than average degree
of skill and a higher than normal desire to compete, a min-
or sports program provides them with an outlet for this
desire.

Unfortunately for Frank Carver, the guardian angel
of Pitt athletics, too many people consider the word “sport”
equal in deﬁnition to the word “win.”

“If you want to be hardboiled about it, a sport should
serve one of three purposes,” says Carver. ‘.‘1. It should
provide revenue to the school. 2. It should arouse publicity.
3. It should create national prestige.” '

This year’s minor sports failed in all three categories.
For those of the winning philosophy, increased allocations
from the State if Pitt goes State-related might provide the
funds to attract the top gymnast or swimmer. But don’t
get your hopes up. '

Even if tuition is cut, the cost of room and board would
remain the same and room and board has been the major
obstacle thus far in alloting more scholarships.

Neither Carve-r nor Jack Critchﬁeld., Dean of Admis-
sions and Aid, are optimistic about State funds being pro-
vided to cover this problem. ‘Carver said, “The way it looks
now Pitt’s new relationship won’t change anything at all for

to the minor sports. _

Sa uer’s Ready to Take

 
 

Charge in Cent-erfield

By JAY ROSENSTEIN
Every baseball coach will make room for a .470 hitter
in his lineup. So there was no argument last year when
Fred Mazurek, deciding virtually on opening day to return

to the Panther. baseball team,
moved right into his accustomed
spot in centerﬁeld.

The player he displaced in cen-
ter is now the baseball team’s
co-captain. He’s Ferd Sauer and
he’s back in centerﬁeld, this time
as the take-charge guy of the
outﬁeld.

“I moved to leftﬁeld once Fred

reported,” Sauer recalled. “But

I’ve always liked center a lot
better. I "have a wide range on
ﬂyballs and I can call the right
or leftﬁelder off the play.”.

As the centerﬁelder, Sauer has
defensive responsibilities. As the
co-captain of a team that went
to the NCAA regionals last year,
he now has additional responsi-
biljties.

“Both Steve (Eiseman) and I
have to act as the liaison between
coach Lewis and the rest of the
players,” he explained. “When a
fellow has a gripe, we relay it to
the coach. And when the coach
wants to get something across to
the players, we help out.”

Sauer helped Bobby Lewis out I

last year by batting a healthy
.325. He’s a spray type hitter,
going with the pitch and strok-
ing mostly line drives.

“I’m not a power hitter,” Sauer
said. “I feel much more comfort-
able hitting line drives and get-
ting singles. Oh, I get my share
of doubles and triples, but I don’t
concentrate on trying to over.
Ddwer the ball. I just work on
getting on base.” '

Coach Lewis recognized that

‘ habit and had Sauer batting ei-
ther first or second last season._

This year’s squad is “mentally
ready to go,” according to Sauer.
“The spirit is real good. Once we
can get outside to practice, we'll

Physically, Sauer is ready for
the year, with no recurrence of
the mysterious elbow injury that

"sidelined him for 10 games last

year. He wouldn’t want to get
hurt now, not when centerﬁeld
and team responsibility are his.
