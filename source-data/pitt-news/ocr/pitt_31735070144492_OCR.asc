Upcoming grads: health

insurance can't be forgotten

Of the 12.5 million residents
of Pennsylvania, or 8.2 percent,
one million don’t have health in-
surance.

That number jumped from 7.5
percent in 2004, according to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. '

These statistics — revealed by
a new, statewide survey —— include
Pennsylvanians from all demo-
graphic backgrounds.

Major urban areas contain the
highest concentration of unin-
sured residents — more than 30
percent reside in Philadelphia,
while Pittsburgh and Harrisburg
each have about 16 percent.

Caught up in their daily lives,
most college students might keep
health insurance at the back of
their minds, but the matter should
be at the forefront for upcoming
grads.

Full-time students — meaning
12 credits a semester at Pitt— usu-
ally still have coverage under their
parents’ health insurance plan, if
their parents have health insur-
ance. But when full-time students
turn 21 or 22, their established
coverage often severs them.

Some students enrolled at
community colleges across Penn-
sylvania attended college full—time
for the sole purpose of staying
on their families’ health insurance
plans.

Health insurance’ is by no
means inexpensive, and looking
for health insurance only adds to
the increasing burden of finding
a job.

Pitt students pay a fee —— sepa-
rate from tuition —— that goes to-

ward medical coverage from Stu-
dent Health. Whﬂe the Student
Health Center provides medical
services such as common-cold
care and STD screenings, its ser-
vices are similar to those offered
at a clinic.

Under students’ tuition, the
Student Health fees don’t cover
prescription pharmaceuticals.
And the Student Health Center
sends any students with serious
medical accidents or conditions to
area hospitals such as UPMC.

The student must cover fees
accumulated from medical ser-
vices that extend beyond Student
Health’s ability. In these instances,
students would benefit from hav-
ing health care, which helps in pay-
ing off exorbitant medical bills.

The care provided by Stu-
dent Health covers a good range
of students’ needs. But students
shouldn’t get used to the “free”
services that it provides.

Even simple medical proce-
dures and basic checkups often
require pricey co—pays in the real
world.

At times, college students are
apt to feel nothing short of invin-
cible. Their feelings are fueled by
the very purpose of the institu-

- tion: The entire point of college

banks on preparing students for
successful lives ahead.

So this semester, as you fret
about graduation, internship op-
portunities and deciding where to
live, don’t let ﬁnding health care
slip your mind. Sure, it will cost
you, but it might cost you more
not to have it.

Have something to say?

High expectations could hinder Obama

by Chris Stokum
Colum/ziat
Women cried. Men cried.

Thunderous applause rose from
more than 1 million people as a
man stepped onto a stage as far as
two miles away from them. Glory
be to this man, apparently. Glory
be to Barack Obama.

The inaugural crowd felt tre-
mendously joyful in the hours pre-
ceding Obama’s appearance. Peo-
ple ﬁlled the Metro, the District of
Columbia’s transit rail system. At
every stop, shouting people forced
their way onto the Metro —- al-
most crushing a maybe 5—foot el-
derly woman who stood between
two large men beside me.

Strangely, though, she shrugged
off the incident and pardoned
how “excited” they seemed. Ev-
eryone forgot the ordeal — until
it recurred at the next stop.

Shortly after, a man near the
front of the car began singing
gospel in a rich voice, and soon

a number of passengers joined
him in a rousing rendition of “ e-
sus on the Main Line.” Most of
them didn’t know the words, but it
didn’t seem to matter. Those with
enough room to move their arms
simply clapped along and grinned.

Sweaty crowds sang on the
Metro as they spat: all over one an-
other and smiled.

Upon arriving on the Mall, the
crowd’s air grew optimistic, even
to the point of reverence._When
Obama’s face appeared on the
Jumbotron, some closed their eyes
and turned their faces heavenward.
These people weren’t simply cele-
brating the election of a president,
they were looking for a savior.

It’s been quite some time ——
eight years to be precise — since
such a large portion of the nation
felt so unabashedly hopeful.

Trouble arises from this opti-
mism, and it’s trouble that seems
to concern few. Obama will —- I
repeat, will — disappoint if we

look for him to save both the na-
tion and our American spirit in
just four years.

People have remarkably high
expectations for the new presi-
dent —— possibly higher than for
any of his predecessors, and this
could turn into Obama’s biggest
problem. .

Slate, an online magazine run
by The Washington Post, posted

The American people 
risk Obama’s impact before

he has the opportunity to make _

one. ‘


“mat

the “Change—6—Meter” on Jan. 21,
just a day after the inauguration.
The magazine put Obama at 40 on
a 100—point scale, based on the dif-
ference he made in Washington.

What Slate, and some other
organizations, apparently doesn’t
realize is that President Obama
has barely been in office for a
fortnight.

Abraham Lincoln did not issue
the first half of the Emancipation
Proclamation until September
1862, well into the second year of

I his first term. John F. Kennedy did

not live to see the space race fully
run and his dream realized when
Neil Armstrong first stepped on
the moon, which came nearly six
years after his assassination.

Despite the hope with which
this election was approached, the
American people —— by way of
ludicrous expectations — risk
Obama’s impact before he has the
opportunity to make one. Judging
by the terms of past presidents,
major changes will not appear
during Obama’s first year. In all
likelihood, the full scope of his
actions will surface only after his
term ends.

Barack Obama is not a miracle
worker. Sure, he led a stunning
grassroots campaign that took
him from relative obscurity to the
White House. Yes, he managed to
break through a racial barrier that
has scarred America since its for-
mation. But he was sworn into of-
fice as a man, not a messiah.

Terrorists will not transform
into saints, and economies will not

\ ‘rise from the dead. Obama has the

power only to patch some holes
in this broken ship, but he cannot
calm the waters or brush away the
storm.

As far as I’m aware, Obama
doesn’t have any halos or robes
hanging in his closet, no sandals
sitting beneath his bed and no sal-
vation hidden in his coat pockets.
And I am certainly not looking
forward to the day when everyone
else finds this out. A

TRAMONES REMIXED

lnstallation by Jesse Hulcher
707 Penn Gallery, Cultural District
41 2456-6666

Four amps. One receiver.
One iPod. Couple these things
with elongated and freshly com-
piled Ramones hits, and Jesse
Hulcher’s latest creation stands
like a giant.

The miniature Washington
Monument dedicated to the Ra-
mones nearly touches the ceil-
ing of the otherwise barren 707
Penn Gallery — amp upon amp.
White walls echo a continuous
cycle of Ramones classics, which
blare on a loop for hours.

“The way I put together
the music, a kind of copy-and-
pasting, is reflected in the stack-
ing of the Marshall amps,” said
Hulcher, a Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity MFA graduate.

With favorites such as “I
Wanna Be Sedated,” “Beat On
The Brat” and “Judy Is A Punk”
echoing from open to close,
Hulcher’s sculptural sound in-
stallation screams repetition.

Hulcher’s album Road to Ru-
imadconsists of 10 completely
remixed and extended Ramones
tracks. The sculptural counter-

part, “Marshalls Stacked,” is a
custom sound system designed
by the artist.

“It’s a kind of a joke because
the Ramones are already consid-
ered repetitive,” said Hulcher.
“The worst thing I could do
would be extending the music.“

Repetition forms a staple of
Hulcher’s works, as he teeters
the ﬁne line between auditory
pleasure and pain.

_ Hulcher attempts to find the
space between satisfyingly medi-
tative and unbearably annoying.
The already repetitive music of
the Ramones offers‘ an excep-
tional medium for this sort of
experimentation. .

“I want people to get the joke,
but also to enjoy the music,” said
Hulcher.

Ryan Emmett, who mans the
front door of the Penn Gallery,
listens to the artwork for up to
nine hours at a time during a
weekend shift. ’

“The repetitive riffs are pretty
cool because I’m into the punk
scene, but after the first few
hours the music starts to worm
into your brain a little bit,” said
Emmett.

The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust,
which supports the sound instal-

lation, has its offices located di-

rectly above the display.

“If they complain, we’re not
supposed to adjust the volume
or anything,” said Emmett, who

tounesy Pittsburgh Cultural Trust
The tower of amps at the 709 Gallery will blast Ramones remixes
until Feb. 27. _ '

controls the volume. “The dis-
play is supposed to be constantly
audible.”

While an intriguing blend of
sound and sight, the Ramones
endeavor -pales in comparison
to some of Hulcher’s previous
works. _

He has forecast the chronolo-
gy of his peers’ deaths, designed
electronic musical instruments

- for the deceased and designed,

so he says, the world’s ﬁrst func-
tioning time machine.

This summer, Hulcher plans
to return to Pittsburgh to curate

_ an exhibit at the Space Art Gal-

lery in the Cultural District.

“The p ‘Marshalls Stacked’
aren’t necessarily about Pitts-
burg ,” said Hulcher. “But, us-
ing yellow cable cords can be
considered a little wink.”

The sound installation might
not be the easiest piece of art to
understand, but Hulcher’s work
has garnered attention from Pitt
students.

As a part of the Pittsburgh
Cultural Trust’s recent Gallery
Crawl, “Ramones Remixes” will
serve as Penn Gallery’s main at-
traction until Feb. 27.

“I trekked all the way here,”
said Jonathan Laurenza, a snow-
covered Pitt junior. “I feel like I
just went on this epic journey,
and this is the mythical obelisk
at the end of the road.”

Peruvian chicken makes its Oakland debut

Like most sensible people, I
throw out mail inserts almost im-
mediately, often before looking at
them.

‘ half-sheet

But when I received a glossy
that simply read
“Mmm  Delicious!!!” in the mail
last week, the usual urge to toss
just wasn’t there. Maybe it was the
picture below of an entire rotis-
serie chicken on a plate with fries.
More than likely, though, it was
the trio of exclamation points.
One is something, but three? Im-
mediately, 'I set out on a quest to
eat at this restaurant.

A]’s, as I learned on Thursday

night, is a true melding of cul-
tures. The__restaurant’s main draws
are burgers and — a ﬁrst for Oak-
land as far as I know - Peruvian
rotisserie chicken and traditional
dishes. The menu looks a lot like
that of Five Guys if it substituted
Peruvian fried rice for, say, grilled
cheese. V

A]’s looks a lot like your av-
erage pizza place on first ‘glance.
There are sparse walls decorated
with art reﬂecting the owner’s

homeland, a soda machine and a
few plants.

The menu was split almost
exactly in half — “Famous Burg-
ers” on one side, Peruvian spe-
cialties on the other. The smell
of the rotisserie was intoxicating
and filled up the entire front half

of the restaurant. It wasn’t hard

_ to decide that my selection would
be from that half of the menu——.

I can get a burger anywhere, but
Peruvian chicken? My options, as

‘I saw it at the time, were A]’s or
Peru, and it was too snowy to at-
tempt a last-minute trip to Peru.
‘I -ordered the arroz chaufa
($6.95), listed as Peruvian fried
rice, including chicken, vegeta-
bles, egg, sliced hot dog and 
wait, sliced hot dog?
Here we had the best of both
halves of the menu. I was sold.
The lovely woman at the coun-
ter smiled and took my order, as-
suring me it wouldn’t be too long.

AJ 's, page 8

Even with the description,
though, I WaSn’t sure what to ex-
pect. A group of diners to my left
had a table full of chicken and all
sorts of delicious—looking food.
The smell-wafted in my direction,
making those three exclamation
points seem worthwhile.

My arroz chaufa came soon af-
ter. I dove right in.

The rice was light and ﬂuffy,
with an almost couscous consis-
tency. Mixed in were peas and corn,
adding a bit of heft to the dish,
along with shredded bits of rotis-
serie chicken. The chicken packed a
bold, dark ﬂavor and gave each bite
a much stronger impact. 4

The problem was there simply
wasn’t enough chicken. The ingre-
dient that was by far the highlight
of the dish was lacking -—— by the
end of the meal only fried rice was
left, and I was missing the chicken
that tied it all together.

The chaufa also contained thin-
ly sliced pieces of kosher hot: dog.
While many traditional recipes for
the dish call for sliced ham or ba-
con, A]’s has chosen hot dogs. This

might not be the best decision.
Hot dogs seem out of place in
this otherwise nicely seasoned
dish.

My side dish of fries ($3.99,
large), ordered ‘.‘Cajun style,” did
not quite meet my expectations.
The Cajun seasoning was hard to
detect, and the homemade fries
seemed a bit undercooked —
fries -this big (about half the size
of steak fries) need to be well
cooked for a crisp, crunchy taste.

Still, had I ordered one of
the more chicken—centric dishes

I don’t think I would have left

even a bit dissatisﬁed.

With an extra rotisserie sitting
next to the front door, chicken
is clearly the A]’s specialty. And
leaving full (of food and long-
ing), I just wanted more of it.

I’ll be back to A]’s in the fu-
ture, but I’ll stick with simpler

foods — namely an entire rotis—_

serie chicken for $12.99. If the
shredded chicken in my dinner
was any indication, A]’s might
earn those three exclamation
points after all. 9

Race relations have taken a giant leap

since the 19705 and ’80s, but these words I

still speak to this nation. The Jacksons’ mu-
sic is a dialogue that appeals equally to both
black and white audiences.

The King of Pop and his brothers bust
out another hit in “Heartbreak Hotel,” har-
nessing state—of—the-‘art synthesizer technol-

ogy and Michael’s incredible vocal range, to _

remake the age—old tale of a broken heart.
As Michael unravels stories of pain, the

background beat integrates his brothers’ _

sound effects —— sounds of a gun cocking
—— to give an added expression of frustra-
tion and desire to break free.

Trizmgb/9 is an R&B album with harmony
and style that doesn’t sound like it came out
of a can. Songsrare ﬂashy and fun, bringing
backan era where pop music didn’t focus
on having sex “in the club.” That philoso-
phy comes through in the musicvideo for
“Can You Feel It.”_

‘The scene opens to a Technicolor vision

of a barren landscape. Waterfaﬂs descend _
. from the heavens, along with “ﬁve futuristic

celestial, intergalactic beings sent to spread
love and bring about peace,” as explained in
the album. That synergy between storyline
and music is something that Michael ‘learned
from his time with his brothers and took
with him as he furthered his career.

When the album opens with “Blame It

damned good the Gloved One was. His
voice sails and ﬂies, while his body gets
down, embracing funk with his signature
moves. In his ﬁrst music video, it’s hard to
focus on anything except for Michael’s clas-
sic spin move. It’s fun to see Michael at 20,
still searching for his body and discovering
what it can do. His later moves echo this
style, but this video lacks the crispness that
brought him to fame. '

Listening to the album offers insight into
Michael’s points of view and inﬂuences. The
combination of soul and.disco serve as the
beginning links ‘in the chain to “Thriller”

“Shake Your Body (Down to the

Pitt finds

by Pat Mitsch V
Senior Staﬂ IV/fiter .

Has Pitt found a momentum-
swinging shooter? ‘

On Saturday against Notre
Dame, freshman Ashton Gibbs
acted as a 3-point tourniquet
against an outside shooting team
during one of its hottest streaks
all year and sparked the rest of

' his team’s outside game.

i,

Gibbs, a freshman who has

I mostly handled the ball as Le-

Vance Fields’ backup at point
guard this season in addition to

seeing some time at shooting-

guard, came in with around 11
minutes to go in the ﬁrst half
against the Irish, when Luke
Zeller was in the middle of hit-
ting 4—of—5 from 3-point range,
leaving Pitt down by as many as
8.

Gibbs hit two quick 3-point— _

ers, then another, and stopped
the bleeding. ‘
“I just wanted to take what
the defense gave me,” said Gibbs.
“They gave me open shots, and I
think that’s my job, to catch and
shoot, and that’s what I do.”
Apparently he doesn’t do

it enough, according to Fields.
Gibbs scored 13 points on 5-of-9
shooting on Saturday, his highest
point total to date.

“We yell at him a lot for pass-
ing up shots,” said Fields. “We
want him to shoot, and he passes
up a lot of shots.”He came in
ready to shoot, and he got in the
game because of that.”

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon kept
Gibbs in at shooting guard for a
good chunk of the ﬁrst half, and
Gibbs ﬁnished the game having
played 17 minutes, his third—high-
est total all year and the most he’s
played since he logged 24 min-
utes against Indiana University
of Pennsylvania on Nov. 22.

“He hit a 3, and he’s one of if

not our best shooter, so we want-

ed to keep him in there, and he
responded with the next two '3s,”
said Dixon. “He can shoot it, and
he’s a good player, and he.’s going
to be a very good player.”

A very good player conside1:- ~

ing his role. Gibbs is part of the
deep Pitt bench that Dixon says
sets his team apart from others
in the Big East. Gibbs, who hit

Pitt center "Pepper" Wilson

 

by Ben Duignan
Staﬁ’ Writer
Two’ disappointing back-to-
back losses in early January seem
like a distant memory. But since
its home loss to DePaul  10,

the Pitt women’s basketball team

reeled off ﬁve straight victories.

The exclamation point came
Friday night against a solid Mar-
quette squad. Pitt didn’t miss a beat
in the 32-point win against a team
that knocked off then—No. 4 Notre
Dame just two weeks ago.

To little surprise, it was senior
guard Shavonte Zellous who ex-
ploded for a tremendous offensive
performance. The senior guard

s versatility starting to show

scored 31 points while‘shooting
better than 50 percent from the
ﬁeld.

Shawnice.“Pepper” Wilson rec— '

ognizes Zellous’ importance to the

_ team."

“When the team is down, we al-
ways look for Shavonte to step up

, and- give us that spar ” said Wil-

son. “She never fails, she never lets
us down.” ,

Pitt coach 'Agnus Berenato
agrees with Wilson and knows that
Zellous has been‘ the emotional
leader of the team.

“[Zellous] did a great job scor-
ing the ball, but she was also really
encouraging to her teammates, she

was constantly_
she said.

There hasn’t been a question all
year about Zellous being the face
of the team. She’s the one who was
on the cover of Sports Illustrated
before- the season. She’s the one
who leads the team in scoring and,
she’s the one who’s headed to the
WNBA.

But it wasn’t just Zellous’ 31
points that helped Pitt take down
Marquette. '

J-,Wilson had the most produc-
ﬁve game of her career, scoring 13
points and snagging 17 rebounds.
She added three steals, blocked
three shots and led the team in as-

talking to them,”

Rice a

Staﬂ Writer

' Hi Mike Rice knows Pitt basket- .

ball well. He knows Jamie Dixon
well. And he knows the players
well. ’

That’s because ‘Rice, now the
head coach at Robert Morris Uni-
versity in Moon, Pa., served as
Dixon’s top assistant and recruit-
er during the 2006-07 season be-
fore using the team’s success as a
springboard to his current post.

So when Rice leads his Colo-
nials (13-7, 8-1 Northeast). into
the Petersen Events Center ‘to-
night at 7 p.m., he’ll know what to
expect from the No. 3 Panthers
(16-2, 6-2 Big East).

He knows the opponents will J
physically outrnatch his men, but 
that doesn’t scare him or his teajn. 

In fact, they feel excited.

Center was expected to showcase

 two of the best frontcourt play-
; ers in the nation: the Panthers’

><

Dejuan Blair and the Fighting

¢Irish’s Luke Harangody.

the No. 3 Panthers outscored
Notre Dame 54-35 in the second
half to emerge victorious, 93-80.

Blair tallied _ 23 points and
pulled down a career-high 22 re-
bounds, ll of them offensively
(also a career—high), and recorded
his 14th double—double of the
season by the end of the first
half.

“I let the game come to me,”
said Blair. “I was scoring, but 22

rebounds, I didn’t know I had all
that.”

Harangody started slow, scor-
ing eight points in the first half
on 3—of—ll shooting, but finished

with a game—high of 27 points V

and 11 rebounds.
“[Harangody’s] a heck of a
player,” said Blair. “It’s kind of

hard ‘guarding him because he’s /
V quick on his feet and he’s got a

little fade—away shot that’s a killer.
He did a good job. I like playing
against him.”

But the highly anticipated bat-
tle between Blair and Harangody
took a back seat in the ﬁrst 20
minutes to the unforeseen Luke
Zeller-Ashton Gibbs showdown.

Zeller, the Irish’s senior cen-
ter, made his first four 3-point
attempts and went 6 for 8 from
downtown in the first half, total-
ing l8 points. But Pitt’s defense
limited Zeller to only one shot

Dame, can be the lights—out
shooter Pitt’s been searching for.
Consider the other op.tions.
The first is starting shooting
guard Jermaine Dixon, who av-
erages around eight points per
game this season and has been
a great addition on both ends of

‘the ﬂoor.

‘ Dixon can certainly shoot, but
seems the strongest “and most
conﬁdent in transition or driving
to the hoop.

Then there’s Sam Young —
Pitt’s leading ‘scorer. His outside
shot can either be effective (10
games with two or more 3-point-
ers this season) or ugly (2-10 from
3 against Louisville). Fields, too,
can hitfrom the outside, but is a
pass-first point guard and can’t
afford to start shooting recklessly
at the expense of running Pitt’s
offense.

Tyrell Biggs, Gilbert Brown
and Brad Wanamaker all have

shown the ability to hit 3s, but
Pitt needs a player that’s a con-
stant threat. Gibbs can be it. 42.;

And once Gibbs hit his 35
against Notre Dame, it got conta-
gious. Dixon made 3—of-3. Fields
made 2-of—3. Pitt shot 9-of-20 as
a team, and Gibbs got it going.

With around 12:30 left to play
in Saturday’s game, though, Gibbs
dribbled twice and threw up a 21-
footer that barely hit the bottom
of the rim.

And on the next possession,
Dixon drained a long 3 with 
shot clock winding. So Gibbs isn’t
ready to start, and, as a freshman
still developing his game, that’s
best for both him and Pitt.

But even if he can be the guy
that comes in, hits a few 35 to
stop an opponent’s momentum
and gives Pitt some of its own
like he did against Notre Dame,
that, too, would best for everyone
involved.

Zeller, N otre Dame ﬁnally cool down

kMen's basketball, page 1.3

in the second half — which he
missed.

Like Zeller, Gibbs didn’t score
in the second half But his 13 ﬁrst-

Tgalf points aided Pitt’s comeback
from an early 10-point deﬁcit.

“I just wanted to take what the
defense gave me,” said Gibbs. “I
think I took advantage of that in
the ﬁrst half. I think it’s my job to
come in and catch and shoot, and
that’s what I did.”

In all, ﬁve Panthers ﬁnished in
double ﬁgures. Senior point guard
Levance Fields scored 17 points
and added seven assists with no

/ltfurnovers.
Junior Jermaine Dixon ﬁn-
ished with 16 points and went 3

 

for 3 on 3-pointers, while sopho-
more Brad Wanamaker added 13
by making all eight of his free
throws.

‘Pitt (19—2, 7-2 Big East) tri-
umphed despite senior forward
Sam Young’s worst game of the
season.

Young ﬁnished with ﬁve
points and four rebounds on
2—of-11 shooting. .

Zach Hillesland scored 12
points for Notre Dame (12-8, 3-6
Big East), which lost ﬁve con-
secutive games and fell out of the
national rankings last week.

“I’m Mr. Positive,” said Notre
Dame coach Mike Brey. “There’s
so much basketball to be played.

Now, there [are] some things
we’ve got to do better. You’ve got
to let this thing play out.”

Zeller’s hot start stunned the
crowd and gave the Irish a quick
20-10 lead. Notre Dame made
ﬁve of its ﬁrst seven long—range
shots.

Pitt responded with an 11-3
run, capped by a contested
3-pointer from Gibbs. But Ryan
Ayers and Zeller punched back,
knocking down back—to—back
3-pointers to push the score to
29-21.

But the Panthers slowly clawed
back, thanks to the efforts of
Gibbs and Fields. Gibbs hit two
more 3-pointers on his way to 13



ﬁrst-half points, and Fields pres-
sured Notre Dame into turnovers
to bring Pitt back to a 34-34 lie.

just as quickly, Kyle McAlar—
ney and Zeller nailed consecutive
3-pointers to give the Irish a six-
point lead, which wound up being
the deﬁcit at the half, 45-39.

Notre Dame ﬁnished the half
with 33 of its 45 points coming
from beyond the arc.

Pitt stormed out of the locker
room with 10 consecutive points
to take its first lead since the
opening possession of the game.

The Panthers defense stepped
up a notch and limited Notre
Dame’s 3-point attempts and
forced more turnovers to extend

 '

Pitt’s lead in the ensuing minutes.

“I think what really hurt us
was how we started the second
half,” said Brey. “A couple turn-
overs, we lost some momentum
there. The thing that they do bet-
ter than anybody, maybe in the
country, offensive rebound, they
did well in the second half.”

A Dixon 3-pointer with 11:06
remaining gave the Panthers 21
66-55 advantage, capping a 27-10
run.

The Irish could get no closer
than nine the rest of the way.
After taking 22 3-pointers in the
ﬁrst half and making 11 of them,
Notre Dame made only 1—of—5 in
the ﬁnal 20 minutes.

gram to its first Northeast Conference
regu.lar—season title and first postseason
appearance in 16 years with a trip to the
NIT.
On its way, the team broke a whopping
L73 school records, including overall victo-
ries with 26.
This year, it hasn’t stopped, jumping
out to first in the conference behind a
balanced scoring attack and a defensively

Students, Faculty,

minded philosophy akin to how Dixon
runs Pitt.

In order to neutralize Pitt’s size and
strength on the inside, expect Robert Mor-
ris to try to lure Pitt’s big men onto the
perimeter, looking to open up driving lanes
and make for easier rebounding opportu-
nities. ..

The Colonials will rely heavily on se-
nior guard Jeremy Chappell, who averages

17.1 points per game this season and is just
14 3—pointers away from Robert Morris’
school record.

Rice said he sees the game as a great
learning experience for his players and
hopes that whatever the outcome, they can
take away positives.

Above all, though, the team has one
goal.

“We play these games to see where our

Staii, all who read THE PITT NEWS:

weaknesses are,” said Rice. “But we play to
win the game.”

Despite those goals, Rice admits a bit
of anxiety leading up to the contest.

“I’m nervous about the overall talent
of Pitt and what they’ve done to non-

conference opponents,” said Rice. “But.

I’m going to be excited to face the guys I
recruited and coached.” 1.
