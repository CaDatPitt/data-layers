Dr. John P. Bruno, a research
fellow in the psychology depart-
ment, was arrested on July I by
city narcotics officers on charges
of possession of cocaine with the
intent to deliver.

Bruno, who has been with the
university since 1980, was
arrested at the Crafton home of
Jan Allen Darcey. Police had a
warrent to search Darcey’s
residence.

The search allegedly turned up
four ounces of cocaine worth
approximately $20,000, powders
and dilutants used to cut raw
cocaine and a quantity of mari-
juana, according to city police.
Police also confiscated $3,139 in
cash. _,

According to Sergeant Earl
Buford of the narcotics squad,
the arresting officers found Dar-
cey in the backyard “sunbathing
or something.” He said they
found Bruno in an upstairs bed-
room cutting about a half ounce
of cocaine.

The remainder of the confis-
cated cocaine was allegedly

found in the room where Bruno
was seized. According to Buford,
“Darcey is considered a major
dealer.” ’

Bruno was freed from the
county jail after paying $10,000
bail. He returned to his office on
the first ﬂoor of Crawford Hall
the day after his arrest.

According to Edward
Stricker, the chairman of the
psychology department, Bruno's
arrest is an accident. “I have no
doubt that sometime soon he’s
going to get off,” he said.

“lt’s inconceivable to me that
he could be a dealer," Stricker
said. He added that Bruno is a
good scientist and the local
authority on behavioral
psychology.

“Some of his friends turned
out to be no-goodniks,” Stricker
said of Bruno’s arrest at the sus-
pected drug dealers home. “l’m
satisfied with his explanation,"
said Stricker.

Bruno said, “the charges are
blatantly false.” He added that
“for the good of the university,_l
would appreciate it if you would
cite just what I said, and that l
have no further comment.”

Protesters request
more stringent policy

By Dirk Kaufman
Editor—in-chief

The role of state Senator John V

Heinz in the upcoming debate ofthe
Anti-Apartheid Act, Senate Bill 635,
was the focus of a press conference-
/ mass picket at the Pittsburgh Gold
and Silver Exchange last Saturday.

Over 80 people participated in the
event, which was sponsored by Pitts-
burghers Against Apartheid. The
Anti-Apartheid Act proposes a ban
on Kruggerand imports, bank loans
and computer sales to the South
African government and any new
investments in South Africa.

Jack Milliones, member of Pitts-
burghers Against Apartheid and
president of the Pittsburgh school
board, said that the function of the
meeting was to remind the senator
that PAA is concerned about the
role it is playing in the passage of the
bill, which was achieved. Milliones
said the group feels “this country
needs to take a more serious position
on a very explosive situation."

' Gail Austin, another member of
PAA, said she feels Senator Heinz
has “taken no leadership" on the bill
and that the amendments he has
supported “are extremely weak and
confuse the issue [of apartheid]."

Richard Byers, press secretary to
the senator, said that Heinz is sup-
porting three amendments to the
issue: ban South African airlines

from American airports. disallow

any new investment in companies
not in compliance with the Sullivan
Principles and from importing pro-
ducts to the United States.

Byers said that the senator is in

‘support of these provisions largely

because of testimony heard in sub-
committee meetings from the Reve-
rend Leon Sullivan. Byers said
Senator Heinz feels that Sullivan
has a good perspective on the major
issues on the South African situa-
tion. He said Sullivan believes the
problem to be an international one.
Byers said that “less than one per-
cent of the black population in
South Africa is affected by Ameri-
can companies doing business there.
Clearly we’re a small percentage;
what we do will not have an effect on
South Africa.”

Byers said the senator feels that
other foreign nations must become
more involved in the apartheid
problem ifthere is to be any progress
made. He said that three subcom-
mittee hearings with Rev. Sullivan
have “crystallized the senator’s
thoughts on how to do this. He feels
that this bill is a good way to force
foreign countries into dealing with
South Africa."

Austin said that the Sullivan Prin-
ciples “no way at all address major-
ity rule in South Africa." She said
that while the senator feels that the
amendments he supports make the
bill stronger, PAA feels they weaken
the bill. She said, nonetheless, that
the object of the meeting was met.

Provost seeks general policy
on intellectual property rig ts

By Kevin Krist
Staff Writer

In an attempt to deal with an
“issue becoming increasingly impor-
tant,” Associate Provost of Plan-
ning, Development and Research
Dr. Roger S. Ahlbrandt Jr. has been
asked by Provost Roger Benjamin
to develop a university policy deal-
ing with intellectual property rights.

Ahlbrandt plans to release a
“White Paper” listing proposals for
a possible policy by the end of the
summer and said he feels that it is
time for the university to develop a
formal policy.

“l tried to get the [university]
senate to move on this [about] one-
and-one-half years ago,” Ahlbrandt
said, “but no action was taken. I feel
it is time for the administration to
take the initiative.”

Dr. Jerry Rosenberg, the dean of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
said he agrees. He believes that the
administration has been dealing
with this issue on a “case—to-case
basis" and coming to individual
agreements with scientists doing
research at the university.

The basic problem lies in finding
“an equitable agreement” between
the university and the researcher
that will encourage research and
provide rewards to both parties in

the form of royalties, Rosenberg
said.

_ Dr. David Hercules, chairman of
the chemistry department, said he
does not believe this to be the case,
however. He cited that the university
patent policy has been revised just
recently and believes that this acts as
an “umbrella policy” and is suffi-
cient in dealing with such cases.

Rosenberg, on the other hand,
argued that as the university gears
more toward research, especially in
the area of computer science, that
this appears unlikely and that the
new policy for which he expects to
be consulted should prove more
equitable to both the researcher and
the university.

Police chiefs debate proposal
to allow assistance by students

By Susan Benedek N
Staff Writer l

An idea has re—emerged which
would recruit college students as
police officers by offeringtuition aid
in exchange for a student’s promise
to serve on his local police force,
according to a recent federally
financed study. _

The study said that the police
chiefs surveyed believed their
departments were seriously under-
staffed and that establishing a police
corps of students who would serve as
officers in return for tuition scholar-
ships of up to $8,000 a year would be
a cost-effective way to increase
police manpower. But Pittsburgh
police personnel are not so enthusi-
astic about the idea.

“ln theory this is good. However,
the plan clearly needs more practical
consideration,” stated Police Chief

David A. Varrelman of the Mt.
Lebanon police department.
Although Pittsburgh's police
department has been experiencing
some personnel shortages, Varrel-
man does not support the student
corps idea.

A police corps composed of col-
lege students is not a new idea. The
concept was implemented in San
Jose, Calif., in the l950s. Police
Chief Varrelman participated in that
California experiment with a stu-
dent police corps.

“The program didn’t work then
primarily because police officers
must pass a civil service exam. In
implementing a police corps, the
assumption is that the student is able
to get through the exam, which is
not true. You are going to have to
change state law for this plan to
work,” stated Varrelman.

Assistant Superintendent of the
Pittsburgh Police Ralph Pampena

also questioned the implementation
of a student police corps.

“You just don’t take any person
into the police force. There has to be
some type ofscreening process. Sup-
pose they were not qualified, or,
even worse, suppose their hearts
weren’t into it?” Pampena said.

The study calls for state and local
governments to help in implement-
ing the program, which would help
students pay for their college educa-
tion in exchange for three years of
service in a police department. The
idea has yet to be tried in any state.

Surveying police chiefs in Califor-
nia, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
New York, Pennsylvania and Texas
by mail questionnaire, the study sug-
gested that approximately one out
of five of the police departments
asked to participate responded. So
far, there has not been a record
released of Pittsburgh's participa-

tion in this study.

The study, paid for by the
National lnstitute of_Justice of the
Department of Justice, was con-
ducted by Jonathan Rubinstein, a
proponent of a police corps.

Most police chiefs indicated that
they “would welcome assistance
from a police corps of young peo-
ple,” Rubinstein said, adding that a
separate survey of college students
in the Boston area found nearly 45
percent of the men and 33 percent of
the women surveyed said they would
probably sign up.

Rubinstein estimated that a police
corps program that produced
12,0000 additional police in active
service would cost $1.2 billion over
10 years. By the tenth year, accord-
ing to Rubinstein, it would have an
annual budget of just under $300
million. He argued that this would
be cheaper than hiring 12,000 per-
manent officers.

According to the study, 70 percent
of all the chiefs responding said their
ability to fight crime is “hampered
by shortages of manpower.” The
police chiefs generally said they
would use the additional officers for
increased foot patrol, greater com-
munity involvement and crime pre-
vention efforts.

“This program would place [stu-
dents] in auxiliary positions, and we
have already entered a program
where we are replacing [them],”

JULY 3, 1985

“You don ‘I just take any person into the
police force. Suppose they are not qualified,
or worse, suppose their hearts weren't into it.”

—Pittsburgh Police Chief

Ralph Pampena

Pampena said..

Both Pampena and Varrelman
state that there is always a “need for
extra manpower.” However, as Var-
relman comments, “there is no real
shortage.”

According to Varrelman, e_very
year 350 to 400 people apply for a
position on the Mt. Lebanon police
force, even though there are no
openings.

“We can always get people in an
unemployed area like this. It is not a
shortage of people, it is a shortage of
money which is controlled by the
individual community budgets, Var--
relman said.

Another issue concerning a police
force comprised of college students
is the dedication such officers would
have.

“I think police work should be
done because you truly want to do it
and not as just another means to

finance school,” said Mark W.
Moore, a CGS senior in administra-
tiori ofjustice who hopes to pursue a
career in law enforcement.

-“However, if someone were inter-
ested in law enforcement as a career,
as 1 am, then this is a great oppor-
tunity. 1 would have participated in
the program myself. Unfortunately,
some might do it asjust biding time,
and police officers shouldn't be bid-
ing time for three years. This is not a
panacea for police problems,”
Moore stated. _ _

Varrelman, who favors a training
program similar to that in Britain
where police training and academic
training are taught in the same insti-
tution, believes that a program such
as a student police corps needs to
balance the ideal with the practical.

“This is a test fit for Solomon,"
said Varrelman. “Which mother gets
what end of the baby?”

Trustees reject SGB request
for divestment in South Africa

By Dirk Kaufman
Editor-in-chief

The board of trustees approved a
final recommendation that provided
that the university not divest all of its
holdings in South Africa.

The action, approved May 14,

came three months after the Student
Government Board submitted a
resolution to the student affairs of
the board of trustees calling for the
total and immediate sale of all uni-
versity investments in corporations
involved within the Republic of
South Africa.

According to the report, “The uni-
versity, in concert and collaboration
with other major universities, will
actively encourage corporations
who are conducting business in
South Africa in a manner contribut-
ing to the advancement of racial jus-
tice and equality of individual
opportunity. Further, the univer-
sity, based upon close scrutiny of
performance, will terminate invest-
ment in any corporation not doing
so.”

The report said that there are two
extreme positions in this issue.
Either total and immediate divest-
ment, as in the SGB resolution, or,

“The university will
actively encourage
corporations who
are conducting busi-
ness in South Africa
in a manner contri-
buting to the ad-
vance of racial justice
and equality of indi-
vidual opportunity.”
—- Board of Trustees
report

investments made solely on mone-
tary return without regard to the
social consequences.

The trustees have settled? upon a
policy of “selective divestment,”
according to the report. The policy
“specifies that the university will not
invest in those American companies
with South African operations that
have not signed the Sullivan Princi-

ples, nor in any company owned by
the South African government or
headquartered in South Africa.”

The report stated thatthe trustees
have ended ownership of all stocks
in companies that do not conform to
these guidelines and that there have
been no new investments in such
companies.

New criteria to assist the trustees
in compliance with the new policy
was also approved by the board.
These include:

Prof links algebra difficulties
to lack of math comprehension

By Kevin Krist
Staff Writer

Algebra has its basis in arith-
metic. However, when a student
encounters problems with algebra,
few teachers understand that the
problem may be a result ofan earlier
misunderstanding of basic arith-
metic principles.

This was the view presented by
Pitt psychology professor Lauren B.
Resnick to a group of approxi-
mately 50 high school teachers dur-
ing a presentation that was part of
the recent Science Update week.

Resnick, the director of the
Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center, recently conducted a

study of 10- to 12-year-olds in Paris,
France and Pittsburgh, in an
attempt to understand the learning

process involved in
algebra.

She found that children encoun-
tering problems with algebraic equa-
tions demonstrated a “misinterpret-
ation of the equals sign  [and a]
weak understanding ofthe funda-
mental notions of functions;” there-
by leading her to believe that
misunderstanding algebra starts
from a lack of understanding arith-
metic rules for manipulation.

This theory was further supported
when she observed that the students
were collectively committing “sys-
tematic errors” rather than random
mistakes.

To combat and correct these
errors, Resnick and her associates
used abstract symbols for functions
and pre-programmed mathematical
rules. They received “output behav-

conquering

ior" similar to that of the students.
They found that the programs were
“reasoning about rules, not the
meaning of statements." This pro-
gram performed a kind of “brain
surgery" on the students to correct
the flaws.

Resnick said she feels that her
research has been successful in help-
ing to “cross the boundary between
learning theory and cognitive psy-
chology” and that her cognitive
research will “help teachers move
forward in instruction."

Psychic

power is "pure hokum"

according to skeptical Pitt prof

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

Foretelling the future and ESP
are, according to Dr. Donald
McBurney, “pure hokum with no
evidence that [they] exist.”

McBurney, a psychology profes-
sor at Pitt, conducted a lecture on
pseudo-science and parapsychology
last Thursday at the Chemistry
Building. He added that psuedo—
science has almost nothing in com-
mon with regular science since it has
none of the characteristics of scien-
tific research.

The field of pseudo-science and
parapsychology started in the 1880s
when people were confronted with
Darwinism and the theory of evolu-
tion. This caused a religous uphea-
val as people began to look to
science with quasi—religious motives
to prove the existence ofGod and an
afterlife.

The word para itself, McBurney
said, “means separate or along side
of. So in a sense, parapsychology is
not really a science at all.”

In the field of scientific research
objectivity, the use of formal logic

and mathematics are reliable tools t

to test theories and hypotheses.
Objectivity in pseudo-science, how-
ever, is weak and inadequate,
McBurney said.

“Dreams are considered facts,” he
said. Every time a psychic is tested

under scientific conditions a nega-
tive response or result from the psy-
chic is achieved. The usual excuse is
that a skeptic was present and that's
why the experiment failed. In the
hundreds of scientific tests taken
since the l880s, there has been little
proof of psychic ability."

McBurney said that science cata-
gorizes concepts with clear defini-
tions, something psuedo-science
does not achieve. McBurney
stressed that psuedo-science does
not require a reason for phenomena
to exist; all that matters is that “if”
you believe it exists. McBurney said
that many people believe in ghosts
but that no physical evidence has
ever been found to support their
claims.

McBurney also said that science is
a social activity. Physicians and psy-
chologists can meet and discuss mu-
tual projects. This kind of social
activity allows a criticism and shar-
ing of ideas. As a result, progress
occurs. On the other hand, McBur-
ney said there has been no progress
in the field of psychic research since
it firsted started in the l880s. This is
because of the poor level of sophisti-
cation. Test reports are often
sketchy and incomplete, giving the
scientist nothing to substantiate the
psychics’ claims.

Most psychic phenomena, such as
bending spoons and guessing
numbers, can be attributed to illu-
sions and the magician’s sleight of

hand. McBurney said the well-
known personality’Uri Geller “is a
wonderful magician, but a lousy
psychic.” Geller so far has yet to
prove scientifically that he has any
psychic ability.

McBurney admitted that “it is fun
to study something so weird," but he
also added that psuedo-science
could cause real harm because it has
no basis in fact. But in spite ofthat,
many people are inclined to believe
in it anyway.

The reason for the popularity,
McBurney believes, is that people in
general like easy answers to difficult
or unsolvable problems. Psuedo-
science can explain away chance cir-
cumstances that happen to us
everyday. Some psuedo-sciences
currently enjoying popularity are
astrology, mind reading and fortune
telling. McBurney said he also
believes that the media is responsible
for the continued popularity of psy-
chics. The reasons why they are pop-
ular, McBurney believes, is that the
psychics tell you what you want to
hear. Because ofthis, astrology fore-
casts remain a popular feature in
most newspapers.

McBurney’s goal is to “teach peo-
ple to use their heads instead of
wishful thinking. We cannot influ-
ence the world except through our
own bodies. We cannot tell the
future.”

PPC sponsors equestrian show
featuring a stallion named Pluto

On Tuesday, July 9, Pittsburghers
will be treated to a Pitt campus per-
formance of equestrian skills by
Robert O. Mayer and his Grand
Prix Lippizaner Stallion, Pluto
Garlana.

At l2:30 p.m. in the driveway of
the William Pitt Union, Mayer and
Pluto will endeavor to demonstrate
a skill Mayer said is being lost in
modern times —~ the perfect balance
of horse and rider that characterizes
classical dressage.

Dressage is a French word which
means “training” and canbe applied
to any animal. Regarding arse-
manship, however, Mayer said, it
involves “gymnasticizing” the horse
so that it becomes as muscularly
supple, ﬂexible and powerful as he
can possibly be. The finished dres-
sage horse, continued Mayer, is then
very adaptable for any equestrian
sport -— be it the Western/cutting
horse, the polo pony, thejumper or
the Grand Prix dressage horse.

Dressage was developed in medie-

, val times when knights in mounted

battle needed to quickly discover
their opponents’ weak points. Their
horses had to be capable of pivotal
turns and rapid speed changes in
close combat conditions. Some
moves — like the capriole, a leasing
movement where the horse strikes
out with its hind feet — drew the
horse into active participation in the
battle.

But the horse and rider, during all
these complicated maneuvers, had
to remain in perfect balance with
each other. And the knight’s armor
was so heavy that if he fell off his
horse, he was unable to remount by
himself.

Over the years, the dressage horse
was used more and more in the mil-
itary until its role in World War I
became the model for the modern
Olympic three-day event. The mil-
itarv animal had to retain its supple-
nes while galloping over rough
ground and jumping obstacles in its
path.

But the training is an ongoing pro-
cess and not just tricks the horse
performs like a dog, Mayer said. The
communication between horse and
rider must be so complete and so
subtle that no movement on the part
of the rider is detectable; indeed,
mayer added, the desired goal is that
the movements come about merely
by the rider’s thinking about them.

Mayer, after having trained in
Europe for many years and under
Georg Wahl, one of the foremost
riding masters of Europe, came to
the United States for the first time in
1958. He has spent the intervening
years developing his philosophy of
horsemanship and learning about
the instincts of the horse. He spent
three years in South Dakota and
Nebraska catching wild horses and
training‘ them for dressage and
jumping.

At his Robert O. Mayer Riding
Academy in Glenshaw, Mayer
teaches the “instinctual” approach
to horsemanship; that it is, he said,
to learn that horses do not think.
They only react by instinct and
therefore, they cannot lie. One must
believe in them, he said. “You must
be more concerned for the horse
while you are riding him than for
yourself. The training, riding and
instincts of the horse must not
clash.”

_ hot-blooded horses,

Mayer has taught all of the
instructors at the academy himself
so that there is consistency of
method. In addition, he breeds Lip-
pizaner and Rhinelander horses
suitable for modern Olympic com-
mittees of both Germany and
England.

Pluto Garlana, a 20-year-old Lip-
pizan stallion, has a lineage which
dates back for centuries. Lippizaner
were originally bred from Arabian,
Morocco Spotted and Andalusion
stock ~— the founding breeds were all
such as
Thoroughbreds.

Pluto himself was bred on a Lippi-
zaner farm in the Midwest but then
was so mishandled by his previous
owners that he was virtually unrida-
ble when Mayer purchased him in
I977 already I2 years old.
According to Mayer, it took three
more years of learning how to trust a
rider again before he could ride
Pluto with any reliability. Pluto is
now a favorite mount of Mayer’s
and as one of his breeding stallions
this year, it fathered a filly and two
colts.

After eight years with Mayer, 20-
year-old Pluto retains his elegant
style and his youthful appearance.
Mayer and Pluto have given many
Pittsburgh area performances, most
recently in the Heinz Hall courtyard
for the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s
production of “Rodeo.”

The Pitt campus performance is
co—sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council and the Robert O. Mayer
Riding Academy. Admission is free,

and a rain date is set for July 23.

Rush responds

Maurice A. Mallin suggests
“rational, evenhanded” debate is in
order on the merits of the proposed
Strategic Defense Initiative, popu-
lariy called Star Wars, program. I
agree.

In my talk I quoted former Secre-

tary of Defense James Schlesinger’s A

cost estimate of $1 trillion for Star
Wars and the need for an additional
$50 billion a year to strengthen air
defenses. If Mallin believes that this
is nonsense, perhaps he should say
why.

The Union of Concerned Scien-
tists in their March I984 report on
space-based Missile Defense, sug-
gests that computers will be required
to carry out billions of arithmetic
operations per second.

Robert C. Aldridge, in a Back-
ground Paper of Strategic Comput-
ing, states that: “The best of today's
high-speed computers can perform
about 500 million operations per

second. But that is not adequate for
the massive amounts of data to be
processed in space warfare and the
Strategic Defense Initiative. VHSIC
(very high speed integrated circuit)
technology will lead to high density,
high performance integrated circuit
chips with a goal of performing a
billion or more operations per
second by 1986.”

If it is “inaccurate, assertive and
an unseemly form of demagoguery”
to quote such sources, it would cer-
tainly add to the debate to say why.

As for my comments on the Euro-
pean reaction to SDI, in my talk I
focused in particular on the reac-
tions of conservative government
officials, especially British Foreign
Minister Geoffrey Howe. In a
March 15 speech he suggested that
“there would be no advantage in
creating a Maginot Line of the Zlst
century, liable to be outﬂanked by
relatively simpler technology and
demonstrably cheaper counter-
measures.  We shall have to ask
ourselves not only whether the West
can afford active defenses against

*Regularly $48.00
*Must be Redeemed by 7/ 10/85
*Call now for details*

nuclear missiles. We must also ask
whether the enormous funds to be
devoted to such systems might be
better employed.”

In addition to cost considerations,
Howe raised questions that indicate
concern about an expanded arms
race: “Would the prospect of new
defenses being deployed crank up
the levels of offensive nuclear sys-
tems designed to overwhelm them?”

Finally, he asked, “Could we be
certain that the new systems would
permit adequate political control
over both nuclear weapons and de-
fensive systems? Or might we find
ourselves in a situation where the
peace ofthe world rested solely upon
computers and automatic decision-
making?"

These are some of the questions
all of us must address before the eco-
nomic momentum of $30 billion in
research funds makes it impossible

to stop SDI no matter how ill-

advised. I hope all ofusjoin in on the
debate.

Poul Weller brings style to
iozz, socialism and obscurity

THE STYLE COUNCIL
Internationalists
Gefen

Style Council fans will be
pleased to know that Paul
Weller has not found his niche.
Unlike nearly every other big
name British band, Weller
(strings, synthesizer and vocals),
Mick Talbot (keyboards and
backing‘vocals) and semi-
member l9—year-old Steve
White (drums and percussion)

I have not settled into a comforta-

ble money making grove and
begun to skip like a broken
record -— every song on their
new album Internationalists is a
self—contained work expressing a
complete thought (almost revo-
lutionary these days, this
“thought” bit). Each song is also

_ a separate and distinct musical

I

entity; it’s perfectly easy to tell
one song from another.

This is not to say that this new
album is nothing but a jumbled
mess of songs which have
nothing to do with one another,
thrown together in one place
willy-nilly with no regard for
continuity or cohesiveness.
Indeed if there’s one note-
worthy improvement over Style
Council’s last full lp, My Ever
Changing Moods, it’s that Inter-
nationalists has a unifying
theme. Two unifying themes,
actually: a jazz sound and, of
course, socialism. (This social-
ism theme is given away early by
the characteristically lively blurb
by the Cappuccino Kid on the
back cover.)

The first track on the first side
is a bluesy piece called “Home-
breakers” which slides out of the
speakers with a deep, full sound
and evocative lyrics (As I rise
from my bed/I can hear the old

man/blaming heaven and
mother for this/30 years with
one firm / 13 months redundant /
yes I’d say that's unlucky for
some), expressing the jerk and
drag of a very real social/eco-
nomic problem and a deeper sen-
sitivity. Not that International-
ists is a self-pitying lament; while
songs like “Homebreakers,” “A
Stones Throw Away” and “With
Everything to Lose” don’t do
much to make a person pop up
and shuffle. The album is mostly
a statement of principles — that
the world’s not a place with
countries and governments. Nor
is it a massive ball too big to
imagine with nothing to worry
about except whether we’re
going to be blown to bits by
prime ministers and presidents
(far away benevolent giants).
But that it’s really a rather small
place inhabited by individual

Block Flog tightens loose nuts

BLACK FLAG
Loose Nut
SST

If someone said to you, “Hey,
the new Black Flag record is
out,” you’d probably respond,
“I’ll pass. I’m still bored from
their last one.” And you’d bejus-
tified, because this band, in the
last two years since the end of
their legal problems, has put out
some self-indulgent, dull and
uninspired crap.

However, it seems that this
time out Black Flag has decided
to tighten-up and focus their
sound, making a more honest
attempt at least at listenability if
not at actual accessability.

This is the record we’ve all
been waiting for: the logical
antecedent to Damaged. Admit
it! My War, Slip It In and Fam-
ily Man just didn’t cut it. They
had the same nihilism, sure, but
where was the zaniness and
excitement of the old days?

The two obvious singles on
Loose Nut are “Bastard in Love”
and “Annialate.” And they’re
both (would you believe?) catchy
tunes. These two songs, like all

Dl:ll:ll3l:ll:ll:lElDCll:ll3Ell:ll:lElE]lZ]Ell:lClEll3Cll:ll:ll3

   
 

the better songs on the record,
are the work of Greg Ginn. Ginn,
the band’s discordant guitarist,
the only original member and
founder, is and has always been
the band’s guiding light. Vocalist
Henry Rollins, on the other
hand, is merely the most visible
— and the loudest. The self-
proclaimed poet’s lyrics are no
better than Ginn’s and his are
nothing worth mentioning here.

As you’ve probably noticed, I
don’t love this record.) It’s catchy
at times. Sometimes it’s like
Damaged with coherent produc-
tion. But, it’s a long road back to
excellence. I, for one, hope they
make it and join the ranks of
their label mates The Minute-
men, Husker Du and The Meat
Puppets.

In the long run,"you’ve got to
give Ginn and the band credit.
They took an idea and a sound
and stuck with it. When no label
would touch them, they formed
SST records. When the police
raided SST, they rebuilt it and
when legal problems bogged
them down, they continued to
sign bands. While Black Flag
might not be up to SST stan-
dards musically, they are the

kind of rough and tough individ-
ualists that make this country
great. And that’s what counts 
right!

responsible for their own lives.
Internationalists is not per-
fect, however (not that that
should be an aim). Weller still
sometimes ﬂogs an issue to death
with directness, as when, at the
end of “The Stand—Up Comic’s
Instructions” the burley obnox-
ious voice turns philosophical
and wise (keep ’em laughing and
don ‘I let it stop / or the truth
might catch up and spoil the
plot). But such instances are rare
and , as I have said, only keep the
album from being perfect.
There are no rules here, no
manifestos, instructions or
demands. Just thinks. Thinks
with music, of course, and even a
philosophical love song; “Boy
Who Cried Wolf” at the end of
the first side. As the cappuccino
kid says in his liner notes, “upon

tudes and spirit. There will be
contradictions as well for you
cannot hope for perfection in an
imperfect world.” But so long as
we keep on moving, keep on
thinking and keep on feeling, the
perfection’s not an issue.
Probably the worst (or best,
depending on your mood) that
can be said of this album is that
in our time when perfection,
patriotism and brutality are the
key to commerical success,
Internationalists is doomed to
obscurity and financial failure.
Of course, in endeavors as

human and genuine as this one, »

commerical success means even
less than perfection. Art is, after
all, not investment and contri-
vance, but the objectification of
something lasting, and the unfe-
tered communication of a living
mind.

The rise and fall of AOR radid:

from the Beatles to the compact disc

By BILL FERGUSON

Since its origin, radio has
proven to be the most fluctuant
of all the media. Where the
printed news medium remains
relatively non—partisan (ideally),
a strong case can be made to
illustrate parallel shifts in radio
format and contemporary
mores: Were society to enter a
conservative period, radio
would follow in accord.

Radio really didn’t become a
primarily music-oriented enter-
tainment medium until the 19505
— until the invention ofthe “sin-
gle.” (lronically, the single thing
that liberated radio — abso-
lutely no pun intended - was to
become the medium’s growth-
inhibiting stigma.) At the time,
as was the case before, per-
formers were fleeting since the
song was al1—important. Who
happened to sing the tune was
incidental, a morsel for trivia
buffs. This, of course, changed.

Soon it became apparent that
the pop music industry had a
wealth of untapped resources,
and that pop performers and
their songs meant more to ado-
lescents than anything else. Big
selling albums soon followed,
and with them Top-40 hits, and
pop stars suddenly had a chance

for longevity. This trend solidi- _

fled in the late ’60s with Sgt.
Pepper’s.

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band, the classic Beatles lp,
is generally credited as the inspi-
ration for AOR, (album oriented

radio). With students involved in.

protests and everyone either a
knee-jerk liberal or a staunch

  
 

  

conservative, radio DJs felt left
out, so they decided to join the
corps of the radicals — they
would play songs even if they
weren’t on a chart or were longer
than two minutes and 50 seconds
(see Inna-Godda—Davida, Iron
Butterfly’s I8-plus-minute
opus). While it seems pretty
insignificant in the scheme of
things, radio, for the first time in
more than 10 years, was
liberated.

As the chaos in Vietnam and
other newsmaking areas of the

globe quieted down, AOR coin— _

cidentally lost some steam.

The pop music of the ’70s,
although providing for the first
time a channel for all types of
contemporary music -— heavy
metal, soul, glam, boogie —
music became complacent, pre-
tentious and self-indulgent (i.e.
anything by Yes). As the econ-
omy was riddled with stagﬂa-
tion, a stagnant economy with
inﬂation, AOR coincidentally
petered out.

In I976, The Sex Pistols and
punk rock exploded out of Eng-
land and New York City, swiftly
yanking out the foundation of
contemporary music. With
punk, the bands were no longer
important. Punk spawned New
Wave, music for hip musicians
who couldn’t stomach punk, and
radio was ressurrected. Punk
bands cut the guitar solos and
self-indulgence, read as “every-
thing intrinsic to ‘early ’70s
rock,” sang the songs and got off
the stage. What was more, they
had a loose format in which to
play. Surely the deliverance of
the medium!

Then thesis met antithesis.
And got married.

Someone had the great idea‘.
that since these new wave and
punk bands were so visual,
someone should invent music
television.

It sounded like a good idea.

Videos were made, and MTV
was spawned from the bosom of
radio. Except there was one
small problem — while MTV
would have loved to abide by the
AOR format, uh, bands really
didn’t make video albums then,‘
and AOR was dropped for CHR
- contemporary hit radio. And
with television being the marve-
lous advertising medium it is,
radio was soon to look at the
grass on the other side of the
fence. And the radio lords did
smite AOR.

But now they’ve changed the
rules. No longer can we rely on
shifting ideals and dialectical‘
materialism. The rules were
changed.

Last week, WDVE 102.5 FM
moved their station — and
upgraded in accord. Proudly,
they announced that most of
their material will be played off
compact disc. Now, that sounds
all good and well; compact.discs
sound better than albums. But
what struggling independent

label can afford to sign a band’?

and put out a compact disc in
lieu of an album so that .it has a
chance of being played in the big
leagues but never sells because
compact discs haven’t exactly
reached the mass market? So
there’s a chance that only estab-
lished artists or those pondering
the format will get record con- *
tracts.-and radio airplay.

That’s not fair. That’s chang-
ing the rules in the middle ofthe
game. A

.Big East class of '89, the first in post—Ewing era

With the graduation of Patrick
Ewing, Chris Mullin, Ed Pinckney,
Bill Martin —— the list goes on and on
— the Big East has found itselfin the
process of rebuilding to match the
power the conference possessed last
year when three Big East teams, St.
John’s, Georgetown and eventual
national champion Villanova, all
competed in the final-four.

The Big East class of ’89 does not
produce the hype that say Ewing did
when he signed with Georgetown,
but talent-wise, Big East coaches
should remain happy, and you can
bet the money will keep flowing.
Competing in the Big East next year
will be the 1985 Players of the Year
from Boston, Ohio, New York state
and Washington D.C. While that is
no surprise in itself, the real surprise
is who they will be playing for.
Unlike the last few years when
Georgetown seemed to be landing
all the better players, the wealth has
begun to spread out among the other
teams in the conference. This past
year saw Seton Hall and Pitt, among
other teams, have outstanding
recruiting years.

Seton Hall signed six new players
to their outstanding sophomore
class to form a strong nucleus for
next year. Pirate Coach P.J. Carle-
simo raided the New York City area
for ﬁve of those new recruits, three
of which were all-city performers.

Gerald “General" Greene, a 28
ppg scorer from Brooklyn, could be
running the offense for Seton Hall at
the start of the next season, a stra-
tegy that would allow sophomore
James Major the off-gua_rd spot.

Another freshman who should
help out immediately will be New
York State Player ofthe Year Daryll
Walker. Walker averaged over 21
ppg and over l3 rpg last year as he
led his Bronx All Hallows High
School to the state championship,
being named MVP in the process.
E Khyiem Long is the third all-city

performer, but in 1983, Long sat out

a year after graduating from Bronx
Adlai Stevenson in I984, the same
high school that produced Pinck-
ney. Long averaged l9 points and I2
rebounds his senior year, and shot a
hot 71 percent from the field. Add to
that guard John Morton, a 6-2
guard who led New York Cit in

4'

I

   

scoring last year with a 36 ppg aver-
age, and Frank Torruella, a 7-0 cen-
ter, and you have a strong recruiting
class. But that is not all. Carlesimo
added the top prospect from Puerto
Rico, Ramon Ramos, a 6-8, 235
pound center.

Pitt, in the same mold as Seton
Hall, added another strong class to
their already strong sophomore
class. Roy Chipman signed a player
rated as high as the second-best
prospect in the country in 6-6 guard-
forward Jerome Lane from Akron,
Oh. The addition of Lane could be

 

Jerome Lane

the difference in Pitt cracking the
Top 20 next year. In short, Lane can
virtually do it all. En route to
becoming the Ohio Player of the
Year last winter, Lane averaged 27
points, 14 rebounds and seven
assists as he led St. Vincent-St. Mary
High School to the Ohio AA
championship. '

Chipman also tied up a loose end
with the signing of Tico Cooper, a
6-9 center from Allegheny Com-
munity College in Pittsburgh.
Cooper averaged l4.l ppg and 11.2
rpg Coach Bill Shay’s no-star system
at ACC. With the graduation of
Andre Williams, should Keith Arm-
strong not fit Chipman’s expecta-
tions, Cooper should be the key.
With Cooper, Lane and Charles
Smith teamed up in the paint, Pitt
could have their most intimidating
front line since the days when Sam
Clancy patrolled the baselines at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Guard MikeGoodson miht also

Only a short 5 minute walk from Pitt

see some action. A 6-3 defensive
demon from Elizabeth, N.J., Good-
son was ranked in the Top 30 point
guards in the country last year. With
the return of J oey David, Demetreus
Gore and Curtis Aiken, Goodson’s
time may be limited. But if the
absence of a true point guard in the
Pitt attack is as evident as it was last
year, Chip could turn to Goodson.

Steve Maslek, a 6-8 center from
Freedom rounded out the Pitt
recruiting class. Maslek is not
expected to have the same impact as
Lane, Cooper and Goodson, but he
will eventually play.

Georgetown suffered perhaps the
most devastating loss in the confer-
ence in Patrick Ewing. It is not even
sensible trying to replace Ewing,
because his shoes cannot be filled.
Coach John Thompson gave it the
old college try, though, and he did a
fine job. Thompson landed 6-9, 245
pound bayou giant Jonathan
Edwards from New Orleans, La.
Edwards is bringing in some impres-
sive numbers. Try 21.7 ppg, I8 rpg
and 10 blocks. If Edwards even
approaches the amount of effect that
Ewing had in the Hoya pressure
defense, Georgetown could be tough
again.

Thompson also landed another
Dunbar High School product, 6-7
Darryl Prue. Prue follows in the

‘footsteps of Hoyas David Wingate

and Reggie Williams, both Dunbar
graduates, and could fill the void at
power forward left by the gradua-
tion of Billy Martin.

Other Hoya recruits include Bob
Winston, a 6-5 guard from DC, and
Jaren Jackson, a player Thompson
took a chance on. Jackson sat out
most of last year with a stress frac-
ture in his foot, and wasn’t as heavily
recruited as the other Hoya
prospects.

Boston College and Coach Gary
Williams have added five new play-
ers. Williams’ prize is Kelly Monroe.
Monroe, an all-state performer from
Connecticut, is a 6-5 swingman.
Monroe averaged over 23 ppg last
year, and shot 59 percent from the
field. Williams also added Dana
Barros, a 5-l0 guard who averaged
over 36 ppg last year en route to
being named Boston Player of the
Year‘ Steve Benton a double -fi r

   
 

scorer from Philadelphia; Gary
Cole, a 7-0 exchange student from
England; and Tom Hjerpe, a 6-8 for-
ward from Worcester, Ma.
Connecticut Coach Dom Perno
had the smallest recruiting class in
the conference, adding only two new
players to a seasoned, returning
group. The notion that good things
come in small packages held true
here. Perno signed one of the top
forward prospects in thehcountry, 6-
9 forward Cliff Robinson. Robin-
son, from Buffalo, N.Y., averaged,
22 ppg, I2 rpg, four blocks, three

 

Mike Goodson

steals and three assists. It's the type
of player you want to build a pro-
gram around. Robinson is said to be
tough inside, but can also hit the
jumper from I8 feet. Remind you of
anyone, Pitt fans?

Connecticut also added a quality
guard in Phil Gamble. Gamble hails
from DC, where he led All Saints
High School to an l8-0 mark last
year with a 24 ppg average.

Providence and Coach Rick Pi-
tino followed suit with Conn., a
small recruiting class of only three
players. Pitino however was faced
with a small problem: He was not
hired until mid-March, late in the
recruiting year, after Joe Mullaney
retired. Despite the late start, Pitino
did not do bad at all. The Friars
added a very talented athlete in 6-5
Bryan Benham, an all-state per-
former in three different sports at
Catersville High School in Georgia.
Also, Pitino signed Bronx product

New York City performer; and
Patrick Mosley, a I9 ppg scorer
from Atlanta, Ga.

One other addition to Pitino's
squad is 6-8 transfer David Sne-
deker. Snedeker came over from
Iowa where he played sparingly, and
will not be eligible until the I986
season. '

St. John's was faced with the task
of replacing Bill Wennington and

Chris Mullin as the heart of their -

team, but just like in the case of
Georgetown, this might not be pos-
sible. Louie Carnesecca gave it a
good effort though. Carnesecca
added Marco Baldi, a 6-H Italian,
who graduated from the same high
school, Lutheran, that produced
previous Redmen post men Wayne
McCoy and Wennington.

Kevin Fitzpatrick, a 6-0 guard, is
the only other high school player in
the Redmen recruiting class, but
three transfers became eligible. The
first is Greg Jones, Shelton’s older
brother, from Suffolk County Jun-
ior College; John Hempel, a 6-7 for-
ward via the University of
Massachussetts and Matt Brust, a
6-4 guard-forward who left Dean
Smith and North Carolina. If St.
John’s has the same success it had ,
with other transfers (example: Wal-
ter Berry), look out.

That leaves Syracuse and Villan-
ova. Syracuse signed one recruit
who will have an immediate effect,
6-9 power forward Rodney Walker
from Baltimore, Md. One of the top
I0 front line prospects in the coun-
try, Walker will team with Wendel
Alexis opposite Rafael Addison.
The other two recruits are players of
6-l guard Sherman
Douglas, the DC Player ofthe Year,
will eventually replace Pearl
Washington; and 6-11 Erik Rogers,
from California, will back up Rony
Seikaly.

Villanova had a good recruiting
year, and now that Rollie Massi-
mine is definitely coming back, it
could be a happy year for Wildcats
again. Replacing a player like Ed
Pinckney is as hard as replacing
Ewing or Mullin, but Massimino
also had to replace Dwayne
McCalin and Gary McLain. He did
both. -
