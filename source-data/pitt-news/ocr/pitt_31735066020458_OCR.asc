Dead rats — Rats!

  No funds to replace 200 diseasedroden

By Dan Bates‘
The Pitt News

_Over 20f) diseased laboratory rats
in Clapp Hall died recently when the

building’s heating and cooling sys-

-tems malfunctioned.

On». Sept. 16,. many rats at Pitt’s
psychology department became
weak and _tired. Breathing seemed
difficult, and blood appeared on the
noses of the rodents. By September

23, over 200 rats died or were put to
sleep, according to Dr. Peter Hol-
land, a psychology professor who
used the rats for behavioral research
and classroom,labs. “This ‘is such a
severe loss — a terrible_thing,” he
said. , -
Initially, the rats were exposed to
a chronic lung ailment when a sup-
plier unknowingly brought in rats
that carried the disease, Holland
explained. “The disease is notfusu-‘
ally fatal, though, unless therats are
subject to unnecessary. stress,” he

Candidate update

‘By Greg Evanina
The Pitt News

' You are all probably familiar with

Geraldine Ferraro, the Vice Presi-i.

dential Democratic candidate. But
you may not know that a woman is
' also a candidate for President of the
United States. Her name is Sonia

Johnson and her candidacy is pri- _

-marily supported by the Citizen’s
Party and the Consumer, Peace and
Freedom Parties.

_ Johnson, a 48-year-old Utah
native, first announced her bid for
presidency in- the wake of the
national attention she received for
being excommunicated fro_m the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.- The Mormons ousted John-
son because of the support she gave
to the Equal Rights Amendment,
which the church considers a threat
to the family unit.

After her separation from the
church, Johnson became even more
active in‘_ the" peace and E.R.A.
movements. In 1981, she wrotethe

’ book, “From Housewife to Heretic”
and is currently working on another.

Why does Johnson feel the need
to run for‘presidency? Not torbe
elected, she says, but to raise the
crucial issues she feels would other-
wise be down—played by Reagan and
Mondale. The most. important
issues are disarmament and
women’s rights, according to
Johnson.

In a, New York ﬂmes interview

prior to ‘her formal nomination,.

Johnson, said, “Our major goal is
not numbers of votes’. This is not the
year for that. Yoig. run this race not
to win the White House but to keep
alive the tradition of dissenters, the
tradition that »makes possible
democracies.“ — ’ -
According to Liz Hughes, a state‘
committeeperson of the Consumer
Party, P Johnson was
because she is the type of candidate
who fits the Party's ideals. She said
. that one of their main ideals is peo-

ple should‘run- the government +
not the reverse. I

The- Consumer Party, whichewas
founded 18 years ago in Philadelpia,
originated from protests aimed at
high utility costs." The Citizen’s
Party, for which Johnson is a
national candidate, became affil-

-iated with the Consumer Party

because they share common views.

After the Citizen’s Party endorsed,

Johnson on Aug. 11, 1984, the Con-
sumer Party followed suit and
announced Johnson as their candi-

According to Hughes, Johnson’s 

_main focus is on disarmament and

the exploitation of women. Hughes '
said, “There really has to be a com-'

plete change in the way’ human
beings operateif we are to survive."
She addedthat Johnson is a good
candidate because she is dedicated
to the issues whether or not she wins
the election. “People who want to
vote for peace can vote for Sonia
because, even after this election,
she’ll work to end nuclear madness.”
Johnson, who is currently on the
campaign trail, made a recent stop in
Pittsburgh, where she reaffirmed her
platform. She feels that cutting the
’military budget in favor of social
programs would bebeneficial to the
nation. Ultimately, Johnson'w_ould
like to develop a society which is
based on people working together

for the good of the nation.

Although she knows that she may
not win this election, Johnson hopes
her campaign will enhance the credi-
bility of third-party candidacies, just
asshe hopes it will enhance the pub‘-
lic’s view of the Citfzen’s, Consumer
and Peace and Freedom Parties.

‘ ‘Commenting on the ramifications

' of Johnson’s bid for the Presidency,:

Hughes said, “.We certainly haven’t
won elections in the past, but we’re
proud we did win ballot status. Our
expectations as a party are not to
win, but to build a grassroots consu-
mer movement. and togrow as a
party so that when we do Win office,
we _will have a constituency to take
.over —- not just figures.”

_A drastic ﬂiictuation in room
temperature where the rats were
caged created enough stress to kill

‘many of the diseased rats, he

explained. “The temperature
changed from 70 degrees to 48
degrees then rose to about 94
degrees in’ only four days," he said.
“With that much heat, the rats
dropped like flies.” _

The remainder of the diseased rats

‘were put to sleepiwith high doses of

an anesthesia, according to Central

Animal Facilities director Paul
Bramson. “Once the rats are sick,
they are no longer valid for studies,

.50 they’ must idepopulate the dis-.

eased rat colony and start over,” he
said. '

The sudden deaths of the rats did ,
create significant problems for Hol-
land and the psychology depart-
ment. Holland was using the rats to
research animal behavior. “Most of
my research was long-term, so stud-
ies were ruined.',' he said.

Nuclearwinter on the horizon?

By Joel Bloom
The Pitt News

Nuclear winter would be hell on
earth, ‘according to Pitt physics pro-
fessor John Townsend, who spoke
before the Pitt Arms Race Study
Group yesterday. The title of his lec-
ture was “Deterring Deterrence —
Nuclear Winter." .

Speaking of work done by scien-
tist Carl Sagan and others, Profes-
sor Townsend said that in a nuclear
winter, “Dust is thrown into the
atmosphere by the explosions. This
dust blocks the sun’s rays. The
atmosphere takes on an enormous
burden. A cloud would envelop tlré
nothern hemisphere within 20 days.

By Lisa Gottschalk

A rare opportunity is being given
to Pitt students interested in art. Vis-
iting Mellon Professor Edward Fry
is teaching a class on abstract
expressionism, an art movement
that began in the ’50s by American
artists working in New York.

_ The class is unique because, as Fry
said, “A good book on this subject
has not even been written yet

soot, not on the ground. Upwards of
95 percent of the sun's rays would be
blocked, reducing the earth’s surface
temperature to around minus 60
degrees Fahrenheit. The change
would occur within 20-30 days. The
minus 60 degree stage would last for
three to four months. A stage with
the temperature at minus 20 degrees
would ensue for the next five to six
months following.”

Townsed did mention one “posi-
tive” note. He said that there proba-

E bly would be no ice age. “However,”

he stated, “we can’t telljust what the
effect would be of the snow which
would fall over a large area.”
Townsend also spoke on the bio-
logical effects of the nuclear winter.
He said that most plant life would be
destroyed. “Most affected,” he said,
would be the tropical rain forests,

one doesnot have enough perspec-
tive on the whole thing yet.”

Professor Fry, who is considered
to be one of the few authorities on
the subject, holds the Andrew Mel-
lon visting professorship and com-
mutes to Pittsburgh from
Philadelphia. His past education
and experience include studies at
Princeton and Yale, studies abroad
in Paris and a position as past cura-
tor at the Guggenheim Museum in

' Townsend offered this idea for
absolute deterrence: double-
barrelled pistols with nuclear
rockets coming out either barrel.
The odd thing here is that one barrel
is pointed at the victim, and one is
pointed at the one holding the gun.
Townsend described this as “mutual
suicide.”

Asked if he thought a nuclear win-
ter would occur within our lifetime,
Townsend said, “I’m the hopeless
optimist. I don’t think so. But I do
think that somebody is going to

Have fun,

use
humor
say star

  teachers

By Nancy Janis
The Pitt News

Relating course material to stu-

‘ dents’ lives, using a little fun and"

imagination and maintaining a sense
of, humor are all components of-
good teaching, according to three
University of Pittsburgh professors
who are all recipients of the Chan-
cellor honor, an award given for out-
standing teaching. A -
These points were all emphasized
at the lecture, “The Art of Teach-
ing," held Tuesday Sept. 26 in

,Forbes Quadrangle. _The lecture,

which was sponsored by the Office
of Faculty Development featured
Howard A.'Kuhn, a professor in the
department of metallurgical and
material engineering, Richard Sca-
glion, an associate professor in the
department of anthropology and
Bruce W. Dixon, an associate pro-
fessor in the _$chool of Medicine.
Each faculty member elaborated on
his most successful teaching
technique.

,-Kuhn emphasized the technique
of illustration. Instead of “telling”
the students about a certain concept
of theory, he uses illustrations to
help make a point more clear.

Another point he emphasized was
teaching not only fundamentals, bu
what they mean. -

Scaglion shares Kuhn’s views. He
focuses his teaching on the student
themselves and how he would feel if
he were in their place.

“Think of them as people,” he
said, “and how we would feel in the
situation they are in. Let them know
you are concerned about them.” '

Scaglion feels being completely

open and honest with his students is '

the best met ad of communication
and getting ..is point across.

“Don’t trick or shock them with
tests." he said. Scaglion added that‘
he is in favor of having open book
exams because they create less
stress.

When‘all else fails, .“patterning”‘;‘

may be applied, according to Dixon, '
who often patterns his teaching tech-
niques from previously admired
teachers of his.

Dixon feels the three good ways to ~

becomera better teacher are to earn
respect from your students, then
love; look. at the general picture
rather than the details because no
one remembers the details and have
the ability to say “I don’t know” to
your students.

May Day

There’s a song »-being sung in the White House, and it seems
that we’ve heard this song before. One would havethought that

i ' after Meese and his questionable hiring practices, after Charles

Wick and the illegal phone taps and after Richard Allen’s
“forgotten” gifts from the Japanese, the Reagan Administra-
tion would have cleaned house, especially this close to the
election. '

President Reagan’s labor secretary, Raymond Donovan, has
been accused of associating with underworld mobsters and

illegal hiring practices while still in the private sector. Mr. _

' Donovan called the 137-count indictment “nonsense.” Brilliant

‘defense.

The‘ president's reelection bid looks extremely sound. Yet,
his White House appears more like a sinking ship from all the
rats that seem to be surfacing. But rather than being thrown off
by the captain, they have to be ferreted out. Indeed, the captain
seems to be providing them with’ safe refuge.

Reagan has not commented on the most recent public dis- ’

play of wrongdoings in his administration. The Reagan
Administration has made a habit of -keeping silent when
members’ pasts were found to be something less than immacu-
late. If Mr. Reagan wants to obtain or keep the trust of_ the
people, he can no longer afford to dodge these embarrass-
ments. He has avoided the major issues of foreign policy

throughout the election race. It has been a campaign of non- '-

issues.

Reagan has beencalled the “Teﬂon President” due to his
ability to not be tarnished by politically damaging events.'But
now he is developing a credibility gap. The president as.presi-
dent owes explanations to the people that he represents and the
people he hopes will reelect him. ' -

The Donovan case is the most recent rat to surface on the SS
Reagan. Mr. Reagan had better clean the decks for his
November inspection. ’ '

  First Draft

It may not be the most exciting thing to do in the world.

enjoyable, but it is important. The next four years will be

mately and irrevocably affect you. ‘

We are speaking of voting in next month’s presidential elec-
tion. The week of Oct. l to Oct. 6 is National Student Voter

A 3 "Registration Week, and organizations across the country are

trying especially hard to get students to register.

' registered voters. Several hundred thousand students nation-«
’ "wide have registered, and more than 5,700 new student regis-
’ trations have been taken thus far. . ‘ '

Mostiadmonitions about not voting tell you not to complain
about bad government if you didn't vote. That may be true, but

Letters to the Editor

Bored student
finds error’

On Monday, I picked up The Pitt
News and, as is my habit, read the
newspaper from cover to cover. On
this particular‘ day, I had cause to
rejoice: throughout all sixteen pages
there was not more than one error
that I could attribute to sloppiness
on the part of‘ the paste-up crew.
Granted, that one mistake was the

misspelling of the name of our '
Nation‘s president in bold type at the 4

top of the front page, but.I would
rather cope with one major blunder
than several lesser ones. '

Unfortunately, the latter has been
the case in a substantial number of
recent issues. Over the past couple of
weeks, I have run into several sen-
tences which have been chopped off
in their middles. I have encountered
a number of references to incorrect
pages and even more stories which
are continued but give nopage refer-

_ ence at all. Lastly, I have witnessed

countless examples of careless paste-
up practices: uneven spacing, slip-
shod copy positioning , and poor
graphics layout. To print up a typo-
graphical error for layout is one
thing; to paste it up poorly and with-
out regard to its correctness is
entirely another.

A little back, I saw ah ad in the
paper which proclaimed: “Are You
an Isomniac [sic] ?... How about
joining the merry paste-up staff at
The Pitt News?". This ironic adver-
tisement may hold the answer as to
why The Pitt News is so ﬁlled with
errors: it appears that those respon-

’sible for laying out and pasting up
the typography are so asleep at the
time, they can't even see a misprint
before their eyes.

Most of the articles you write are
informing and well composed, but
as it was once said, what you say is
sometimes not as important as how
you say it. In your case, if you’d
concentrate a ‘bit more on the pre-
sentation of your information, the
paper as a whole would beneﬁt. Per-
haps if you did not employ those
stricken with sleeping diseaseson

V your staff, you wouldn’t have to deal

with this situation.

At least, you wouldn’t have to
deal with the misspelling of the word
“insomniac” in future ads.

Static from
the station

In response to the letter in the

Sept. 24 issue of The Pitt News I feel _

it’s time to set the record straight. It
is obvious to me Mr. Halloran
doesn’t know much about radio.
The format at WPTS is in no way a

tightly formatted operation like

ones at B94 or WDVE. WPTS plays
a wide variety of new music that is
not being played on any other Pitts-
burgh radio station. We also
respond to the needs of students and
others in our community by playing
requests almost immediately. Try to
get a request played on some other
radio stations around town.

"Yes, there is a format, but it is a
format chosen by the student,.not by
some imagined director in the
Cathedral of Learning. The reason
why we have a format is that we
want to present a consistent sound
to our listeners. Free-form radio sta-

. tions tend to sound like 17 different

radio stations. For example, on such
afree-form station, I recently heard

an hour of classical, followed by an '

hour of punk, followed by an hour

A of East Indian funeral dirges. WPTS

is one station ——.- programmed to ﬁt
the needs of our audience. These
needs were heavily researched
before we even turned the transmit-
ter on. . .

If Mr. Halloran wants to discuss
the finer points of radio program-

ming, Isuggest he talk to WPTS_
, Program Director, Chris Kramer, or.

myself. 4

The Pitt News, Wednesday,   

Computer learning

Pitt Learning Rearch and Devel-
opment Center Two local
teachers, Leslie F. Thyberg of Glen-
shaw and Janice Baker of Plum
Boro, will represent the Pittsburgh
area as the first nationwide network
of computer training centers open its
doors in November.

The National Computer Training
Institute in a press conference yes-
terdaygannounced it will begin oper-
ations with 90 training centers in 49
The nationwide centers,
located in public and private
schools, are each equipped with 15

new personal computers, peripher- ,

als and software.

The new concept in computer
education gets under way with 180
instructors in place across the coun-

try. NCTI, an independent organi-'

zation located in Fremont, Calif.,
plans to open a total of 200 training
centers by the end of 1985. NCTI is
the first organization to offer
national computer training by a staff
of teachers who are -themselves pro-
ficient in the use of computers.
The Pittsburgh NCTI training
center will be located at Falk Labor-
atory School's Demonstration
Classroom, housed in the Learning,
Research and Development Center

-_at the University of Pittsburgh.

Computer equipment at the lab will
be available for use by the students
during the regular school day at no
charge to the school. NCTI classes
will be held in the evenings on week-
ends and during vacation breaks.
Thyberg is a demonstration teach-
er/ lecturer at the University’s lab
school, having taught there for seven
years. She holds a joint appointment
in the School of Education at the
University of Pittsburgh where she

teaches‘ reading and language arts.

methodology courses to undergrad-
uates.- Baker teaches with Thyberg in

.a multi-age primary classroom.
Baker has been involved in educa-.

tion for eight years. In addition to
elementary certiﬁcation, ‘Thyberg
holds certification as a reading spe-
cialist and Baker is certified in spe-
cial education, K-l2. Both are
pursuing doctoral degrees at the
University of Pittsburgh.’ '

_Thyberg and Baker, chosen by .

NCTI afterextensiverecruiting and
interviewing, successfully completed
a two-week intensive course in
NCTI training materials and tech-
niques offered through University
Extension at the University -of Cali-.
fornia, Berkeley, and held’ at the
Lawrence Hall of Science on

" campus.
Both teachers have been actively «

involved with computer applica-
tions in the classroom for the past
several years. Thyberg has done a
wide range of consulting work- and
in-service training" in the tri-state
area, particulary in the uses and
applications of LOGO. Baker
recently conducted a summer
LOGO computer camp for interme-
diate age children.

Says Thyberg, “Our philosop_hy is
that, while there are many appropri-
ate uses of computers in schools,
their effectiveness and long-range

impact will be largely determined by

how teachers choose to use them.
We‘ believe .that the future use of
computers will-be not only as a tool
for personal record keeping, drill,
remediation and communication,

. but more importantly as a powerful

tool for problem solving and per-

sonal development. It is for. this —
I future use of technological tools that"

we are preparing our students" and
teachers. I think our site is an unusu-
al one in -that it is a primary level
classroom, grades K-3, with 60
children. i

The Pittsburgh center also will be
part of a nationwide communica-
tions network, linked together
through The Source Information
Network, to allow T hyberg and
Baker and their teacher-students to
exchange information with the other
NCTI centers. '

The initial NCTI course, entitled
“Using Computers Personally and
Professionally? A Realistic Course
for Educators,” covers 45 hours of
instruction. Subject matter includes

an NCTI»introducti,on to computers, .
._ _ iword.pro”cessing, graphic arts, data
.Jba,s_es,rspreadsheets, BAS,I(_;,

 

._.LOGO, communications, applica-
tions software and planning for
instructional computing.

Teachers who successfully com-
plete the NCTI course can earn
credit from a local university, yet to
be established.

The NCTI course initially is
aimed at teachers at the
kindergarten-through-12th grade
levels, although others in education
may enroll. Cost of the program is
$195 for each individual taking the
course. Class size is restricted to 30
students, or two per computer.

The computer training centers
each will contain l5 IBM PCjr com-
puters with 256K RAM, color moni-
tors and graphics printers, plus a
wide range of applications software.
In addition, each center will have
access to two modems for communi-
cations with other centers and with
The Source. .

The National Computer Training
Institute develops and supplies its
own courseware and operates inde-
pendently from IBM. Founded and
staffed by professional teachers,
NCTI is the only privateiorganiza-
tion with a nationwide program that
uses teachers to teach about compu-
ters. The NCTI concept is receiving
the support of IBM, The Source and
many educational institutions.

“Those rats cost ' the University;

Holland said he approached the C in
FAS dean with a written request for. '
the funding, but he didn't hear from

the dean for over -a week. “The uni-

thing,” he said. Finally, the ‘dean — 7

justified the delay as “a problem of ,

he had to get an assurance that the

Rosenberg blamed the deaths on" P
W the “hazards of high technology.

People come to rely too much on all
sorts of systems, but the systems are
not always fail-proof.“

Holland said he was annoyed at
the small amount of funding granted
to him by the dean. “If the university
doesn’t want to provide funds for a
course, they should say so before the
course is offered,” he said. The rest

of the funding may have to come out A I

World News T

MIDEAST (UPI) —— A pale, thin
and drawn Menachim Begin made a
rare public appearance today, but
the . former Israeli prime minister

’ offered no explanation to why he‘

"has been in seclusion for 13 months.
‘ Begin emerged today from the Jeru-
salem Medical Facility where he has
been hospitalized for three weeks for

2 prostate surgery. Reporters and

photographers swarmed around the
man who has hardly been seen since
heresigned his office one year ago

I last'month. Begin smiled, kissed a
» nurse on the forehead and wished
. Israel a happy new year, but refused
to answer questions and quickly

 drove off with his daughter for his

home.

‘I _ ‘Also in the Mideast, a clue to the

’ fate of two missing Americans in

Lebanon. Syrian officials are.
reported to have heard from an
' underground group that claims to be
holding diplomat William Buckley
‘and Cable News Network corres-
pondent Jeremy Levin, but there has
been no indication of when the kid-
napped Americans can be freed.

National News
(UPI)—Labor Secretary Ray-
,mond Donovan will appear in a

«- Bronx, New York, court today [O~
_ face arraignment on criminal

charges against him and the con-

struction company he helped run tor
more than two decades. Donovan
and seven other current or former
members of Schiavone Construc-
tion Company and the firm itself
were named in a I37-count indict-
ment yesterday. The New York
grand jury indictments stem from an
investigation into 'Schiavone’s rela-
tionship with an excavation com-
pany owned by New York .State
Senator J oseph_Galiber and reputed
mobster William Masselli. The firm
did work for Schiavone on a New
York subway contract. Donovan
said his indictment “lt’s not worth
the paper it is written on." He's tak-
ing a leave of absence to fight the
charges, which he calls “a mindless
inquisition.” He said that he fully
expects to resume his‘ duties as soon
as what he calls “this injustice” has
been dealt with. White House offi-
cials said under-secretary B..Ford
will replace Donovan on an interim
basis. When questioned about the
indictment, President Reagan said
he had “complete trust” in Dono-
van’s integrity.

(UPl)—Barbara Mandrell is out
of the hospital today and headedfor

a complete recovery- from serious -

injuries she suffered last monthin an
auto accident in suburban Nashville.
But, doctors say it's going to be a
long, slow process for Mandrell who
suffered a leg so badly broken a
metal pin had to be surgically

planted in her right thigh bone. Doc-
tors say the 37-year-old Mandrell
will be on crutches for the next three
to four months. A full recovery
could take up to eight months or
more. Mandrell and her two child-
ren, eight-year-old Jamie and 14-
year-old Matthew, were returning
home from_ a shopping trip when
their car was struck head-on by
another car on a highway in Hender-
sonville, Tennesee. The children
were not seriously hurt, but the 19-
year-old driver of the other car was
killed. . .

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —
Carnegié—Mellon University
announced today that three of its
computer scientists have been
awarded a $19 million contract for
research on new super computers for
the U.S. Defense Department. The
three principals in the research are
Raj Reddy, Director of CMU’s

Robotics Institute, and H.Kung and

Allen Newell, both computer science -

professors. A CMU spokesman says
the contract will bring an estimated
$5 million this year, $6 million in
1985 and ‘$7 million in 1986.

PITTSBURGH (UPI) — Cyclops

- Corporation announced today that

it is studying plans to permanently
shut down the fabricating opera-
tions at its Dover, Ohio. plant in its
Empire-Detroit Steel Division. A
spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based
Cyclops says the operation involved

', would include the metalware, stove-
' pipe, and roofing’ departments. The

operations would be closed down by

. the end of this year if the plans are

implemented — idling about 130 of
Dover’s 350 employees. Cyclops
says the shutdown would result from
“the extremely competitive market
conditions’? for galvanized, fabri-
cated products — such as buckets,
pails, stovepipes, and roof-drainage
items. The Cyclops spokesman says
that the move would, have no effect
on Empire-Detroit’s other major
product lines at the Dover and
Mansfield, Ohio, plants.

Should Miss
America be
trashed?

Collegiate Features Syndicate —
We should have known something
was up when Bert Parks got sacked.

When the venerable pageant host
and crooner (of at least one tune)
was asked to hang up his micro-
phone and join the unemployed
queues, it was but a matter of time.
In the years since, Miss America has
grown up, put out and faded away.

She’s run for 63 years, far longer
than the 13 weeks afforded most
tired, outdated network offerings,

-and now it’s time to put her to bed.

Indeed, it is well past her bedtime.
If there is one thing the Vanessa Wil-
liams controversy proved.— besides
the scientific discovery that Pent-
house publisher Bob Guccione is,
truly, the lowest form _of life — it is
that Miss America the pageant, Miss
America the concept, Miss America
the Cheshire-grinned cutie with the
ﬂimsy duds and a mind to match has
become a sexist splotch of hypocrisy
on the white bread blotter of the
American public. . ’

This is something many observers
have noted for, years. Filmmaker
Michael Ritchie’s “Sm,ile" took a
satirical potﬁshot at pageants back in

’ 1975. Jean-Luc Godard classified"

the archetype 10 years earlier. His
“Masculine/Feminin” includes a
short interview with an attractive
teen recently named “Mademoiselle
19” by a French magazine.

She has won a contest to represent
the magazine, in turn receiving
prizes rangingfrom a new car to a
trip to America. Godard entitles the
segment “Dialogue With a Consu-
mer Product.” V

_‘de}_t§ _at:1dfchiffon. I 1‘

Miss America is a consumer prod-
uct, not merely due to her appearan-
ces and endorsements, but because
she sells an image. The ingredients
which are combined in that image’s
formula, (the formula Vanessa Wil-
liams didn’t follow), are precisely
where the pageant’s hypocrisy lies.

The pageant began as a swimsuit.

competition, sponsored by a swim-
suit manufacturer, and there is little
evidence to suggest anything has sig-
nificantly changed. Consider the
pageant by its judges’ categories,
such as talent, ability to be articu-

‘late, and the swimsuit and evening

gown competitions.

' Talent may be considered a valid,
non-exploitative category. Despite
the trials of sitting through clumsy
piano recitals and endless arias from

“Gigi,” the talent portion of the"

evening can be justifiably
entertaining.
Yet, if talent were the important

determinant here, these girls would '

be on “Starsearch.” Considering
that a recent “Starsearch” finalist is
now the host of video‘s “Rockin’

America," the Miss America pag-'

eant may even be preferable.
The pageant’s question and

answer segment, which tests'how'
— articulate the young ladies are, is

also (unintentionally) amusing. “If I
could be like any woman in the
world?" -a contestant ‘a few years
back pondered, “I’d probably be just

_ like Golda Meir." Such ambitions

are as unimaginable as Golda herself
in‘ a banner‘-emblazoned _ lycra

J Speedo.

This brings us to the evening gown
and swimsuit competitions, cheese-
cake for dessert. If a contestant
hasn’t_ already opened a substantial
lead over her competitors after the
talent and articulation segments,
now is her chance to show the judges
what she’s made of.

You’ can’t nail down that college
scholarship, that whirlwind year of
travel and Bob Hope specials, unless
you strut your stuff in front of the
many million pairs of concupiscent
peepers the pageant advertisers are
counting on.

Surely, these segments illustrate 2

how the Miss America pageant’s
standards incorporate all the virtue,
integrity _and humility which we

< ideally find in the All-American girl

next door. That is of course, if the

, girl, ‘next door comes wrapped in a
cuiivaceously snug package of ,spa~n-I ‘

_Forty pieces of international

- children's art from UNICEF will be

exhibited at William Pitt Union Art
Gallery by the Pitt Program Council
from Oct. 9-31, from 10 a.m.-,5 a.m.,
closed Saturday and Sunday. The
young artists from 40 countries
range in age from six to 16.
Although they may be expressed
differently, the themes found in

« children’s art reveal many common

interests and experiences linking the"
world's peoples. When asked to

. shgwsomething from their lives or

environment, ‘children frequently
picture. themselves working and

‘ playing — at home and in school —

in cities, towns and villages, or on
the farm. They show secular, or
more often, religious celebrations.
In this exhibit, for example, scenes
of family life‘share common ele-
ments. At the same time, they reflect

national and ethnic characteristics.

-, Eight-year-old Gabriel Gilardi
painted a portrait of his family out

on the town in Argentina's capital

city colorful, cosmopolitan
Buenos Aires. A serious note is
struck in “The African Woman,” an
impressive black and white drawing
of a moth'er and child, by Chisi
Al_berto Mkandawire from
Tanzania.

In lively contrast, thirteen-year-
old Catharina Corlander-‘s painting
captured the gaiety of Sweden’s

  

Midsummer Festival, and the fun of
celebrating it with her family as they
dance around at ﬂower-bedecked
pole under the beneficient rays of the
midnight sun. Miles away, the sun is
also shining in Egypt, where Cherine
Mohamed Ezzat, age I0, is celebrat-
ing Muhammed’s Birthday with a
smiling sugar doll whose crayon
portrait once appeared on the cover
of the UNICEF Wall Calendar.
Other paintings in this exhibit fea-
ture children chasing butterflies in
Canada and bees in Czechoslovakia,
a classroom scene in Panama, a rice

paddy in Nepal, a Puerto Rican boy .

climbing a coconut palm, a Ukrain-
ian soccer team in Kiev and a base-
ball game in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

The United States Committee for
UNICEF maintains a collection of
international children's art from
over 160 countries and territories.
The pictures show some aspect of
the social or cultural life ofthe child,
such as a family or school scene, or a
group of children celebrating a holi-
day or playing games. Each year, 13
pieces of art are chosen from the
collection to illustrate the Wall
Calendar produced by the United
States Committee for UNICEF.
Other pieces of art grouped into
exhibits such as this one can be sche-
duled for schools, libraries, muse-
ums or any other place where a large
number ofpeople have an opportun-
itv to view the art.

Legislation  
Passed

On Thursday, Governor Dick

Thornburgh signed legislation that

will simplify the work permit pro-
cess for teen-agers, while retaining
all the protections of the Child
Labor Law.

Senate Bill 582, introduced by
Sen. Robert J. Kusse (R-Warren),
allows minors between 16 and 18 to
transfer work permits from
employer to employer.

“Current law‘ requires a.new per-
mit every time a teen-ager changes
jobs,” said Thornburgh, “and this
bill will provide relief from the
burden of paperwork and school vis-
its for parents and their children.

Any employer who receives a
transferable work permit must pro-
vide, within ﬁve days, the issuing
school district with the minor’s
name, age, number of working
hours and days per week and type of

employment. When employment is.

terminated, the employer must
return the permit tothe minor and,
within five days, must notify the
school district. ‘

Parents who wish to control the
latitude under which their children
seek employment may continue to
apply for a work permit eachitime
the child changes jobs.

The new law takes effect in 60
days.

Sophomore spiker Kris Wexell’s duties include receiving serves

 

  Burkholder has
 right attitude   l  

I ByTeresa Varley.

For The Pitt News

“If there's something you want to
do, there is nobody who can stop.
you but yourself If you have the
right attitude, you can do anything.
you want."

The right attitude is what’ Pitt
soccer player Rick Burkholder has
in abundance. The junior from Car-
lisle, Pa. knows what he wants and A
nothing can hold this determined
athlete back.

“I came to play this year,” Burk-
holder said recently. “I want to be an
all-time player at Pitt. If I have a bad
game,'I want the coach to have con- '
fidence in me and let me continue to
play.” I ' \ h

After two years of off and on play-
ing, Burkholder has earned a spot in
firstyear head coach Joe Luxbach-
er’s starting lineup.

_ “The last two year_s have been
rough,” Burkholder. said. “There
have been a lot of ups and downs. In

_ high school it was fun. But I have no
regrets at all about coming to Pitt.
Joe has really changed things. I am
sorry that I am ajunior and I will be '
leaving soon. It is a great program
and Joe is going to take it to the
top."

Although Burkholder lacks some
of the strength‘ of his teammates, he
makes up'for it easily.

“Rick’s biggest attributes are that
he is an intelligent player and he

reads the game well," Lu"bache1'
said. “Heis composed andis a., ‘ay-

 maker. He is great at setting things

up. He can real-ly start an attack. He
can help lead the way for some ofthe
younger players.” .

Leading the way 15 something that

"is important to Burkholder.

“I want to be a leader,” he said. “I
want to bring the team closer
together- and ‘bring -unity to the
team.” .  . ‘ .

Burkholder has been playing
organized soccer since high school.
His coach 'at Carlisle, Charles

Meninger, and his father.have,

encouraged him.

“My father has been a real big
influence on me,” Burkholder con-
tinued. “He never put a lot of pres-

sure on me. He never pushed me but

always "encouraged me. He taught
me to be an athlete. My high school
coach taught me to be a soccer
player, though. He showed me the
basic aspects of the game.”

Burkholder not only uses his intel- ‘

ligence and good attitude on the
field, but he also applies it to his
school 'work and everyday life. The

athletic training major, who is a stu- _

dent trainer for other Pitt sports

teams, knows what he wants out of .

life. .
“When I graduate, I would like to
be a trainer on the college level,”he

said. “l have received a lot‘of help"

from other student athletes and I

want to help them the way they have '

the court oppo-

exell’s height no factor

- By Laurie Kubli

The Pitt News ' ‘

At 5-5, Kris Weimllis one of the
two shortest members of Pitt’s
women’s volleyball team; fortu-
nately, stature is not necessarily an
‘accurate and reliable. measure of
value to a team.

“Many coaches passed-her off as i

being too short,” said head coach
Shelton Collier. “They didn’t. see her
ability, for which I suppose I should
be glad. We were one of the few
major volleyball programs to recruit
her, and hundreds of less-
accomplished programs passed her
up. Many of those are the teams we
are beating 15-3, and they realize
they made a mistake.” .

Wexell is ‘a sophomore who is
playing her; second season as a star-
ter and is a graduate of the nearby
volleyball capital of Pennsylvania,
Norwin High School. She carries a
-responsibility on the team akin to
the centers in football; it isher duty

to recieve as many serves as possible, ’

beginning every offensive play Pitt
makes.

. '‘ “She is perhaps the most valuable

player on the team," Collier co_m~
mented. “The most important way

_.to prevent the other team from scor-
ing is with consistent receptions of

\

their serves. When Kris is receiving
well, it makes it difficult for_ the
other team to score.” . -
Wexell said that a coach’s confi-
dence in an athlete's ability has a big
effect. “It always helps that someone
has conﬁdence in you. It give me a
little boost, makes me work harder.”
This nursing student transforms
what many would consider pnessure
to receive all serves into confidence
that she will perform her backicourt
duties well. “It-’s my main job, and it
worked this» weekend,” Wexell
explained. “I feel some pressure
because it’s rnyjob, and ifI don’t do
what I’m supposed to, then the team
can’t set up and spike, but I have
confidence in'my passing ability.”
However, everyone makes mis-
takes every now and then, and even a
team that is 12-1 has a bad day occa-
sionally. “During games ‘when
things get bad, I try to helpvout my
teammates,” she said.’ “When I’m
doing badly I can usually bounce
back and keep my concentration
going.” -
In addition to being the team’s
primary serve reciever, Wexell is
also an effective spiker. ’ Collier
remarked, “She is extremely short
for a spiker, especially at a successful
Division I program like Pitt, but she
jumps 27 inches and has a very quick
arm swing and spikes effectively. We

have worked a lot in practice on '

improving her power and her ability
to hit around tall blockers.”

Offense
lacking,
answers
missing

By Mark ‘A. Sindler
The Pitt News

June, July and August sim-
mered with all the intensity _of a
steaming kettle of‘ water. While
golfers, sunbathers and other
outdoors. types weathered the
heat, the Pitt football program
withstood a similar, constant
onslaught of limelight.

During a time of pre-season
predictions and other idiotic
innuendo, the Panthers, in one
corner, were legitimate contend-
ers for the national champion-
ship. In -another corner, one
self-acknowledged football
authority who writes alongside
the pornographic pictorials
smoothly dismissed his‘Pitt 4-7
predict_ion last year, going so far
this time as saying “this could be
Pittsburgh’s year.”

Add to it all theitimes one runs

’ out of ﬁngers counting how
4 many polls ranked the Panthers

in the Top 20, I0 and 5.

Many drummers beat the
same tune: The good times
would continue'in Oakland for
third-year skipper Foge Fazio.

Obviously, an 0-4 record has
solidly put ‘things in perspective.
With thedisastrous turnaround

has come a boatload of similar '

language, whether from Fazio or
any of his assistants and players.
Consider: ’
0 Why can’t the offense sustain
the drive? “I don’t know. We
have to balance out the run and

. the pass more." . '

0 Who’s your starting quarter-
back this week? “Whoever wants
it badly enough in practice.”

0 How will the team prepare

‘differently for this week’s oppo-

nent? “The effort is still there.
Everyone wants to win more
than ever.”

Okay, so nothing’s concise,
everything’s boring. If anything,

the entire team exudes tremen- '

dous ability to hide frustration as
opponents salivate while await-
ing their games against Pitt.
Except for a Penn State or a
Miami, it presents great oppor-
tunities to “make theprogram,“
as Temple did two weeks ago.
“The only thing I cansay,”
Fazio said yesterday, “is what I

said after the football game.

Sometimes the situation gets
worse before it gets better. As I
said to the players afterward, I'm

responsible for bringing them_

here, and I’m responsible for see-

_ ing them through. As long asgthe
players follow, we have the,

opportunity to see this thing
through. We know what the
problems are; A we're going to
solve them.” I '
Especially problernatic is Pitt’s
running game, once deeper than
the'Yukon’s annual snowfall. In
fall camp, fullback, Bill Beach
reinjured a shoulder that led to‘ a
redshirt last year. A bothersome‘
leg injury hobbled another full-

back, senior Marc Bailey, in’

camp. He recovered in time for
the first game, but sprained an
ankle against Temple and might
play next week.

Sophomore tailback Chuckie
Scales moved to ﬂanker two

weeks ago to fill Dwayne'Mil- ‘

loy’s place, while the latter recov-
ers from pulled stomach muscles
suffered in camp. And fullback
Marlon McIntyre is considered

healthy, though he‘s tending to a

minor strained knee.

“When you talk about the run-
ning game," running back coach
Andy Urbanic said, “consider a
combination of things. When
slamming the ball down the field,
that speaksgfor itself. At, ‘imes,

rm Pitt News, wednesday,Qc;¢te. 3, 1i§§4iTn  I *4” e ,

Football history repeats itself I

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

A lot of things were very_different
l0 years ago this week.

The Pittsburgh Pirates were play-
ing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the
National League Championship ser-
ies, the Pittsburgh Steelers were

' thinking about benching their start-

ing quarterback Joe Gilliam for a
guy named Terry Bradshaw and I
was in the fourth grade.

However, not everything was so
different. One thing was the same
this time 10 years ago as it is today:
The Pitt Panthers had. yet to win a
football game. '

The names were very different. In
1974 the Panthers were led by a
sophomore running back named’
Tony Dorsett and coached by
Johnny Majors, but the results were
the same. No wins.

In '74 the Panthers thought — like
they thought this season -— that they

had a shot at the National Cham-

pionship and going undefeated,.and
again like in this season, those
dreams died early.

But one thing was very different
on‘ the Oakland campus then. No
one was demanding that the coach
be fired or was trying to pin _the

‘blame somewhere. They were Just

   

 

hoping that things would get better.

So what makes the attitude of the
student body so much more harsh
today than a decade ago? Winning.

Before Majors and Dorsett left
Pitt for greener pastures, they
brought a national championship to
Panther Stadium and laid the foun-
dation for_a winning tradition, one
that was carried on by Majors’ suc-
cessors Jackie Sherrill and Foge
Fazio. .

In 1974 Panther fans were used to
losing, so winning by any amount

.was cause for celebration. During
the last few years fans began to feel '

that a Panther victory was not
enough- Pitt wasn’t just supposed to
win, they were to» win big. Panther
fans became spoiled by success.
Now the Panthers are not win-
ning, just like in 1974. But now the
Pitt faithful want blood. The hottest
topic of conversation at the ‘local
watering holes isn’t if Fazio should

' be fired, but how soon, and who will

replace him.

It is true that if someone doesn’t
do the job he should be replaced, but
you shouldn’t fire the cook until he
has finished the dinner. When the
year is over and the dust has settled,

that’s when you look at the plusses '

and minuses and decide who to hire
and fire.

It's, a good thing somebody
thought that way in 1974.

\

OAS I type_this, the Chicago Cubs
are destroying the San Diego Padres
l0-0 in the first game of the National
League championship series.

Could it be that the Cubs are some
kind of destined team?

The Cubs do have one strange-
looking fan rooting for them; a goat
will be in attendance at Wrigley
Field in Chicago for the series. The
goat and his owner, Sam Sianis, will
be guests of the Cubs, who are being
very nice to Sianis and his goat.

It seems that in 1945, the last time
the Cubs made it to post-season
play, they refused to let local tavern
owner William “Billy Goat” Sianis
bring hisgoat to the game. Sianis
then put a hex on the Cubs, saying

that they would be losers forever. He '

died in 1970 and in 1981 the Cubs
invited the younger Sianis, and the
goat of his choice to a ballgame. Sia-
nis then removed the hex. Welcome
to the twilight zone.

0.1 may be hung by my toes for
saying this, but that has never
stopped me before. It looks to me
like the Pittsburgh Steeler offense is
about the same at the quarterback
spot this year as it was last season.

David Woodley may be even

‘poorer than Cliff Stoudt because

Woodley has better receivers and
running backs than Stoudt ever had.
Take a look at Monday night's V38-17
scalping of the Cincinnati Bengals at

 

*1 

’.

Three Rivers Stadium. Thirty-eight 

points in one game is enough '_'to

make you think that I’m crazy, but 1 A. ,
look how the points were scored.. " 
Two interceptions were returned for _

touchdowns anditwo other intercep- ._ 

tions put the, Steeler offense at_ the

Bengal 38 and 31-yard lines. That 
makes 28 of the 38 points a, directf ’ I

result of the defense and 10 hones
points by the offense. ‘ 

This isn’t the first week, thishas ; 
occured. Against Cleveland 7 of 10 - ;.-'-
points were by the defense, along 

with l4 of 24 points against the Los
Angeles Rams. ‘

The next two weeks will show just?  

what kind of an offense the Steelers

have as they go up against the Miami _ 
Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers, -

both of whom have more wins to
their credit than the'Steelers and the

three other teams in their division A f.}

combined.
All I have to say is, good luck.

Tennis ace de

.‘:By Bob Travers

The Pitt News

Freshman tennis player Carrie
deVera did not want to come to Pitt.
Well, not at first anyway‘.

Fortunately for the women’s ten-
nis team she-changed her mind and
enrolled at Pitt. deVera, who has
played No.4 singles and No.1 dou-

- bles most of this season, has piled up

a record of five wins and three losses

’ this season in both singles and dou-

bles play. She explained her initial
reluctance to attend Pitt: “It is my

second choice really. I wanted to go .
. to Washington & Jefferson because

it’s small and there I would have
been able to play basketball and vol-
leyball. I played both of those sports
in high school and I wanted to con-

tinue, playing. ”

To look at deVera ‘one might_be
surprised.to learn she is an athlete;
her curly black hair, dark complex-
ion and 5-2 small frame mask end-
less reserves of power.

She is quiet and unassuming off
the court, never boasting of her on-

court exploits like many young ath-

letes surprised at their success; when
she steps onto the court, an entirely

different deVera emerges. On the
court, she takes command. Seeming
to anticipate every shot, deVera is
everywhere on the court. Running,
turning in a second to the ball, deV-
era nabs shots that some other tennis
players would be certain to miss.

Waiting for a serve, deVera stands
motionless, eyes fixed on the ball in
her opponent’s hand. The ball is
served and rockets towards her, and
immediately, seemingly from
instinct, she reacts, moving to the
ball for her return shot.

deVera just started playing tennis
again this summer after a six-year
absence from the sport. “I played
competitively when I was 12. I quit
for all those years, then I picked up
my racket about five times this
summer and I liked it and it was my
brother who-‘plays for Pitt’s men’s
team who talked me into playing for
Pitt this year.” 0

She comes from a, family of ath-
letes. Aside from her brother, her
mother is a volleyball coach. “My
family is tennis ‘oriented. My dad
taught us all how to play and my
mom gives tennis lessons.”Just to be
noticed in such a family, deVera got
in the act. “I’ve been in sports such a
long time now, it’s just natural for

V"C).’E.'>l-I (C 2-i"J_C|,‘-.3.‘.I1-l"{';[’~{.\;is’)§)?i-é.l£'£l*l_"i"7' ,-=’l ~'Tx='v'.‘.s. 113-5 1:’ 1') '-,'

me to be competitive. I've always
been competing against something.”
deVera took that attitude to
Elizabeth-Forward High School,
where by her senior year she had
lettered in both volleyball and bas-
ketball, quite an accomplishment,
particularly at a class AAA high
school. Leaving high school did not
come easy for deVera. “Yes, it was
hard to leave it. I was really active in
the school and I got close to a lot of
people during my senior year."

It has been five new friendships
that have kept deVera together since
her arrival on the campus. “It’s real
easy to make friends down here,” she
said. Sometimes she seems over-
whelmed by it all. The sheer number

of students, the enormous size ofthe -

classes and the pace at which life is
led at Pitt can all be frightening to a
freshman who is from a small town.
“This year I met Cricket Thomas

-and Elizabeth Starr, and I’ve only

known them a month but it feels like
we’ve been through it all already,”
said deVera.

' But below the surface lives
another deVera. This is the athlete,
fiercely competitive, with the
“never-say-die” "attitude that
coaches love. “I'm not the type, of

person to give up. I have to try all the
time,” deVera said.

In a match against Slippery Rock
earlier this season, deVera was in
danger of losing her first match of
the year and the first match of her
collegiate career. It was match point
against her in the second set. The
day was hot, and deVera was visibly

-fatigued. She played the point,

calmly and assuredly. Methodically,
she waited for her opportunities and
her opponent’s mistakes. She won
the point and the game was back at
deuce. The momentum was moving
and it was in deVera’s court. Next
point and it was advantage deVera.
She needed one point for the set.
This time she took an extra few
seconds before she served and
played the point. When the point
was over it was point, game and set
to deVera.

“In the match, I don’t know, Ijust
played the point out and I kept win-
ning more and more games. One
thing about that was that I had a
biology lab to go to at 6 p.m. That
set ended at 20 to six, and we still
had another set to play. It was an
important lab, but I had to go out
there with everything I had and try
to win the match.” “Peace within,”is

' i",_';t_I:i_e:£aciﬁc or

Vera   quietly competitive

what teammate Rhonda Gibbs calls
it. —
In most regards, deVera is a nor-
mal college student. “I’m in pre-
med, but I will major in business
because I didn’t want to major in
biology or chemistry,” she said. In
one aspect, though, deVera is quite
different from her classmates: she
has her own fan club.

When askedhow the fan club idea
started, deVera laughed and said, “It
started with the articles in The Pitt
News and all that stuff about me
being a star, they just picked up on
it. Then one day at lunch, Cricket
and Elizabeth and everyone were
ripping on me about it, and saying
they were going to have banners and
shirts and buttons and everything. I
didn’t take them seriously, but there
they were with little fan club shirts. I
couldn’t believe it. It's all a- joke
really, but Mark [club president
Mark Vay] is out trying to get more
people in it and they want to get a
charter bus to the Big East Cham-
pionships in New York.”

deVera was laughing as she said
this, which is not surprising, since
she always looks’as though she is
holding back a laugh.

Even on the court, deVera cannot
get too upset with herself. “I’m not
like that, where I would be yelling
and screaming on the court. Mostly,
I'll just be like, ‘Come on, Carrie,
you can play better,’ or something
like that.” ‘

What is the best thing that ever
happened to her? She paused before
answering, then replied, “I became a
Christian this past summer. That is
the best, thing.” - ' A

BALL (12-1)

“This weekend will be our
most exciting tournament action
yet," said Coach Shelton Collier.

Collier was speaking of the
Tennessee Classic this Friday

’ and Saturday, which will match

Pitt against Nebraska and Texas,
both ranked in the Top 10, and
the Lady Vols, ranked in the Top
20

‘Pitt is unranked at this time,

but Collier expects that victories
over these powerhouses would
vault Pitt into the Top 20.

The Lady Panthers, with a 12-
1 record, are on a roll with 18
straight victories against Big
East rivals Georgetown and
Seton‘ Hall, registered in last
weekend’s conference southern
division tournament.action at
Villanova.

“We are sure to improve with

Pitt is coming off a‘2-0 victory “
over Mercyhurst and will have to
provide more of an offensive
punch to win this week.

“We played well at times,"
Luxbacher said. “It was one of
those games. We had the oppor-
tunities but failed to capitalize on
them. VWe have to score more

goals. In six games, we have only

six goals. We have to take pres-
sure off the defense."

Lexington, Ky., and freshman
David Moss from State College
scored Pitt’s goals at Mercy-
hurst. Junior Brian Casey from‘

“I was really pleased with the
way Brian played," Luxbacher

“If you asked'2b general man-
agers -and 26 scouting directors
to name the five best scouts, I'm
sure Howie Haak’s name would
pop up on everyone.’s list,” said
Brown, who resigned as general
manager in 1976 and now serves
as a scouting supervisor for the
Pirates.

“When I make a trade, I
always ask Howie for this opin-
ion,” said Peterson. “Howie has

filled a great many roles for us, .

from cross-checking amateur
players for upcoming drafts, to
advance scouting the major
league club’s next opponent, to
evaluating major league players

who we may consider trading

for.

“Everyone who has worked
with Howie has beneﬁted from
his great experience and knowl-
edge of the game. It gives me a

tremendous thrill to know that‘

his peers have singled him out to
be the first recipient of this much
deserved award,” said Peterson.
“I just hope thatisorne day base-
ball will open the doors of the
Hall of Fame to scouts because I
know that Howie would be one
of its first inductees.”

Other scouts who received
great consideration in the voting
for Scout of the Year were: Hugh
Alexander, Philadelphia Phil-
lies; George Digby, Boston Red
Sox; Tony Lucadello, Philadel-
phia Phillies; Ralph DiLullo,

Have you ever heard the saying,
“Things are never as bad as they
seem?" Well l’ve got a new one for

Al‘ the Pitt offense: “Things are a lot
worse than they seem.” One deep
V V look into the statistics of Saturday’s

game against WVU will tell the
story.
The Panthers have only scored 46
points in four games. Why is this? lf
you find yourself scratching the

' back of your head over this one,

don’t fret. Misery loves company
and you've got’plenty of it. Chris
Jelic,.who was called upon to quar-
terback for the Panthers in part of
Saturday’s game, is as bewildered as

« anyone. “I really~can‘t put my finger
 on it. One week they said we ran the

balltoo much, one week they said we
threw the ball too much. This week

A we put in a good mix.” '

The problem has not been_ the
mix. It has been the lack of ingre-
dients. If this were food, someimight
compare the ingredients to horse-
meat and Spam.

One ingredient that has given the
Panthers trouble all year has been
the running game, or the. lack there-
of. Charles Gladmen rushed for 98
yards on 16 carries against WVU.
That averages out to an impressive
6.l..yards per carry. But the rest of
the Panther runners were only able
to manage 20 yards on 19 carries, a
lowly l.l yards per carry.

Another important aspect of any
football game is the often over-
looked field position. Pitt’s average
drive started at their own 24, while
the average Mountaineer drive
started at their own 37. To figure out
just how a team did on field position,
you multiply the difference by the
average number of possessions. Pitt
had 15 possessions while WVU had
l3. If you multiply the 14 posses-
sions by the 13 yard difference, it is
discovered that Pitt lost 182 yards
on ' field position. Suddenly it

becomes all too obvious just how
important field position is. .

The Panthers’ first drive was flaw
less. But if the American pioneers
would've covered as much ground as
the Pitt offense did after that drive,
we still wouldn’t have crossed the

During that initial drive, Pitt
averaged 12.6 yards on their first
down plays. If you respect John
Madden’s opinion, that’s the
number one key to scoring points,
getting the big play on first down.
But after that drive," the Panthers
averaged only 4.4 yards on first
down. ,

The Panthers converted both of

the third down situations that they‘.

faced on that drive. They also con-

verted on three of their last four’

third downs. But those last three
conversions came when the outcome
was all but decided, What they did in
between has got the coaches pulling
their hair out. After that opening
drive, the Panthers failed to obtain a
first down on 12 (yes, 12) consecu-
tive third down situations.

When youfail so miserably on a
third down, you have to rely on big

plays on first and second downs to

‘get first downsand keep drives alive_.
This method rarely works. The -Pitt
offense picked up 14 first downs.
However, four came on the opening
drive and five came on the last two

drives. That leaves a grand total of

five first downs for the ‘rest of the
game. ~ , '

Panthers to be held to only two

scores in 15 possessions. You have.

your opinion, but ponder these next
two statistics. ~
During the first five minutes ofth

game, Gladman carried the ball
eight times for 64 yards. But then he
only carried twice more in the first
quarter and not once in the second
quarter. After eight carries in the
opening fiveminutes, he managed
only eight more for the next 55 min-

utes. During the first five minutes ’

Pitt averaged 8.7 yards per play.
That 2.8 average was inﬂated by the
last two drives which proved mean-
ingless. Without those drives, the
average drops to 2.2 yards per play.

Of Pitt’s 17 pass completions on
Saturday, they netted only a 10.3

-yard average. ‘l'hat’s about as explo-

sive as a cap gun. Coach Fazio ‘said,
“We have got to get the ball deep
more.”"But maybe toomuch of the
blame is on the receivers for their
lack of speed. Fazio said, “We think
Chuckie (Scales) has as much speed
as anyone.‘,’ » S

'Maybe the problem lies *else-
where. John Congemi, Chris Jelic

and John Cummings are all good '

quarterbacks, but,n'one of them have
been able to come up with the big
play. In case you’ve "forgotten,
there’s a kid in town by the name of
Dante Wiley, who is considered to
be one ofthe top freshman quater-
back prospects in the country. But
Wiley has been very patient about
things. When asked about whether

he felt it was his age that was keeping
him on the bench, Wiley replied,
“Danny Marino was a freshman. I
guess I’ll have to wait a little longer.
Maybe I‘ll get my chance. l’ve been
throwing the ball in practice, but I
guess just not enough to play.”
Maybe it’s time he was given a

chance.

Here’s a surprise: Pitt kicker Pat
Viancourt just may be the best kick- _
off man in the country. If you
exclude Willie Drewery’s 43-yard
return Sat-urday, listen to what
Viancourt has done on his other 10
kickoffstthis year. Eight of the 10
have gone into the end zone, seven of -
which have beendowned for touch-
backs.
