Dr. Jack B. Critchfield — in a move which has seemingly
been stamped on the history of the 1968-69 Pitt academic year —
resigned from his position as Assistant Chancellor in Student
Affairs and will be replaced by Bernard J. Kobosky. presently

director of admissions.

In a personal letter dated June 20 and sent to Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar, Dr. Critchfield — one of the few remaining
top officials wholworked under former Chancellor Edward A.

' Litchfield — asked that he be relieved of his duties effective

Aug. 22, the final day of the school year.

The young and energetic ad-
ministrator, who had turned down
several job offers by other in-
stitutions and companies in the
past six months, said he had sev-

ggeral reasons for leaving the Uni-

versity.

“One,” he said in a private
interview with this reporter, “is
that I don’t like administering pur-
ely to administer. And two, as
I’ve gone higher-up here, (at
Pitt), I’ve gotten further and fur-
ther away from the students.”

Great speculation centered
around his next assignment,
whether it be an organizational
job or an academic position. _Sev-
eral rumors circulated the cam-
pus, but The Pitt News, declined
mention these citing Dr. Critch-
field’s two reasons:

In his letter to the Chancellor,
Dr. Critchfield said that he want-

ed. his new employer to make the
announcement. In the interview,
Dr. Critchfield said he “would
rather wait until he received the
release in the mail Tuesday.”

The Pitt News learned last
Monday that Dr. Critchfield, who
was in New York city at the time,
was leaving. Subsequent inves-
tigation confirmed the story.

“It’s true, I can’t deny that,”
said Kobosky who trades his of-
fice in Schenley Hall for another
in the Cathedral in the move.
Coincidentally, it was Dr.
Critchfield who left, the same
position in admissions last year.

During the interview, Dr.
Critchfield said that ever since he
had received his doctorate, he
wanted to return to teaching.

Dr. Critchfield, who has served
under four University chancel-
lors,, considered his plan for the
development of thestate scholar-
ship program as his second most
important achievement.

The plan was developed under
Dr. Litchfield. “I was sent to
Harrisburg for six months to
get it rolling. There was nothing
there. The office was just a cor-
ner and all I had was a 60-year
old secretary nobody wanted. It
was just me and her up against
the congressional bureaucracy.

Four hours of sporadic and sometimes heated discussion

about the status of a proposed Black Studies Program at the
University marked Thursday afternoon meeting of the fledgin

__‘lj:aculty of the Arts and Sciences Council (FASC ). “

A good part of the debate centered around the question
of whether to establish a school of Black Studies‘ or an inter-
disciplinary department. Dr. Jack Daniels, professor in Speech
and Acting Director for Black Studies, and Curtis Porter,

Black Action Society (BAS)
official, defended the position

for an autonomous school.

Dr. Daniels emphasized the
differences between Black Stu-
dies and other programs of study

at the University such as Politi-
cal Science. The departmental
structure will not provide “what
.we need,” he averred. He stres-
sed the need for flexibility in an

area that deals with a whole cul-
ture rather than a subject area.

It came out at the meeting that
the Chancellor, Wesley Posvar
and those working on a compre-
hensive program of Black Stu-
dies do not see eye to eye on the
issue. Dr. Posvar, in an open let-
ter to Dr. Daniels, labelled a
lengthy program submitted to him

by Daniels and Porter “unac-.

ceptable. ’ ’

“Because the University must»

serve the interests of the entire
community and indeed the in-
terests of the entire state and na-
tion, we cannot accept a concept

This action came about after Dr. Gow, in a mem-
orandom to Dr. Halliday, requested that the Under-
graduate Cabinet examine the physical education
requirement. Dr. Oerman of the Physical Education
Department spoke to the Council on the importance
of the physical education requirement and distri-
buted a statement entitled‘, “The Option to ‘Elect’
Physical Education.”

It was the general consensus of the Council,
however, that students should be able to elect phy-
sical education if they wished rather than be re-
quired to complete a physical education require-
ment. Scott Baum, SG president, proposed that all
students in the College of Arts and Sciences may
opt four terms of physical education, at one credit
per term, and that these courses should be eval-
uated on an S-U basis. This motion was unanimously

related to the academic world,
the first two “resignations” came
in sports.

Near the end of the school year,
five others went: — Dr. David
Halliday, who dealt with Univer-

. sity research and development as

a Dean in Arts and Sciences,
had to leave the University on the
advice of his doctor for health
reasons.

—Dr. James A. Kiehl, Dean of
the College, allegedly resigned
to return to teaching.

—Dr. James Watson, Assistant
Dean of the College, who had been
seeking a teaching position for
about five years, finally landed
one in Arizona.

, —David Ginevan, Director of

Housing, and William Markus,
Assistant Dean of Students, both
part of Dr. Critchfield’s staff,
combined efforts to go into the

business world, servicing middle

_ management personnel.

In certain circles of the Uni-

versity and before Dr. Critch- «

field’s resignation, well-placed

, informants commented that “the

pressure of the past year was too
much for them to take.”

On the other hand, when told
that his resignation was one in a
series, Dr. Critchfield said that
he “hadn’t noticed.”

Each view appears to be ex-
treme at best; and probably the
‘real answer is a combination of
both. But what does appear to be
a fact is that ever since June of
1967 — when a man from the Air

Force Academy walked through-the A ‘

ivy-covered portals of the Cathe-
dral —— things have changed quite
a_ lot under Chancellor Posvar;

ack -Studies

that might contribute toward grea-
ter separatism in our society,”
wrote the Chancellor in reference
to the proposal entitled Black
Paper for Black Studies.

While endorsing and supporting
the establishment of an interdis-
ciplinary department for Black
Studies, Dr. Posvar insisted that
such ‘a department must be “con-
sistent with and conform to the es-
tablished University policies and
procedures.

Jack Freeman, University Secre-
tary and spokesman for the Chan-
cellor revealed that the Chancel-
lor’s statement was the result of
“consultation with a number of
administrators and faculty mem-
bers” whom he did not identify.

Daniels ‘claimed _that the
charge of separatism was ill-
founded. “Although black students
would be expected to enroll in
the School of Black Studies, they
would not be required. There will
certainly be white students in the
school, as well as white faculty
members if they qualify,” he said.

The factor of control brought out
a number of opinions as to what
power structure the Black Studies
department should be responsible.

A proposal by Dave Tiernan,
Pitt News Editor that “The De-
partment of Black Studies be re-
sponsible, to the Black Studies
Council rather than the FAS” was
opposed by Mark Perlman, Eco-
nomics.

Dr. Perlman suggested that
Black Studies by “under thew-
ing of the FAS”, “We recognize
that you people have a self-de—.
fined community, but you are

‘weak still and lacking in num- _
ber-s,’ ‘ '- '

’ he _c tiinu d

 
   

 hear

 
   

tection of your own autonomy,
you should take advantage of the
800 years of tradition which have
held this school in good stead.
Let us help you along.”

James Malloy, Doctor of Poli-
tical Science proposed that'the
Black Studies program be .imple-
mented outside the University,
in View of the University’s finan-

cial weakness. “The only way I .

can see success is to establish an
urgan-based independent Black
Studies School federally financed,
involving other universities,” he
said.

The representative opinion. of.
the FASC was summed up in a
resolution by Dr. Robert New-
man, Speech, which passed the
body by a vote of 11-5-1. His
resolution supported the Black
Paper for Black Studies and "ur-
ged for a greater budgetary allo-
cation.

It read intact: “The FAS wel-
comes the prospect of a Black Stu-
dies Department and urges the Uni-
versity to provide the fundsical-
led for in the Black Paper for
Black Studies, $417,000.” The
Chancellor’s letter had provided
for a budget of $130,000 for the
department.

Library School
Reorganized '

‘The I University’s Graduate
School of Library and Informa-

 "tion'Sciences has been reorgan-

ized and two academic depart-
ments have been created within

S the existing administrative frame-

workof the school.

I A Department of Information
and Communication Science, cul-

' V — mination of the school’s increas-

ing commitment since 1963 to the

‘ teaching_ of information/commu-

\

nication science courses as a vi-

tal'area of professional study in
.modern librarianship, has been

established with Professor Allen
_Kent as chairman.

- A Department of Library Sci-
ence, with Dr. Frank B. Sessa as
chairman, has been formed and

’ assigned responsibility for re-
‘ . search and instruction in the fun-

damental concepts and more tra-
ditional applications of librarian-
ship. '

Previously, the school had func-
tioned as a single unit, without de-
partmentalization of internal func-
tions. ‘

The division does not imply
that two different degrees will be
awarded. Students will take
courses in both departments but
select their major area of concen-
tration in just one. Division of the
school into the two departments,
their chairman says, will create
clearlyjidentified faculty and pro-
grams relevant to each.

Ohmans-in-Residence

by BILL GORMLEY
Staff News Writer

Although it is not widely
known, the University boasts
its very own Diplomat-in-Res-
idence. During the past six
months, State Department of-
fical John Ohmans has tried to
make the most of his unusual
position in an effort to pro-
vide a link between the State
Department and the University
community.

Offering two reasons for his
presence, Ohmans defined his role
as Diplomat-in-Residence in
terms of both what he can give to

the University and what the ‘Uni-_

versity can give tohim.

The University serves Ohmans
by providing him with “the oppor-
tunity to get to understand the
things which are going on in the
United States.” In order to be-

come more knowledgeable, the.

middle-aged diplomat has audited
a few "courses and spoken with
numerous students and profes-
sors,

ORIENTATION FORUM

To better acquaint incoming
freshmen with current issues-
in the University community,
the next orientation session

cwill include an open forum.
Discussions are planned con-_
cerning the ROTC controversy,
curriculum revision the‘ black
studies program, _state related-
ness, the University’s relation
to the surrounding community,
University housing, and other
issues. All members of the Uni-
versity are urged to come to
120 CF, Monday at 3:30 p.m.
to take part.

Ohmans reciprocates by mak-
ing himself available to members
of the University community in-
terested in acquiring information
about State Department policies
and activities. Also, he will be
teaching a course in labor and in-
ternational affairs in the fall.

Until recently the State Depart-
ment’s labor attache in Caracas,
Venezuela, Ohmans has also serv-
ed in Colombia, Bolivia, Argen-
tina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and
Mexico. Bolstered by 12 years
of experience south of the Rio
Grande, the foreign service offi-
cer discussed Latin American at-
titudes, problems, and issues.

Admitting that the United States

is still regarded by Latin Ameri-

‘cans as the “Colossus of the

North,” Ohmans tried to describe

the “ambivalent attitude of the

Latin‘ American people” toward
their northern neighbors.

“They hate us and they like us,”
the veteran diplomat ' avowed.
“They admire the United States
‘for its social and economic
achievements,” he explained, “but
_they also resent the economic
strength of the United States.”

The De Pauw University grad-
uate singled out unemployment as
Latin America’s most pressing
problem. “Latin American coun-
tries,” he declared, “must in-
crease the number of jobs avail-
able either through their own ef-
forts or with the assistance of for-
eign investment.”

Attributing a measure of Latin

America’s misfortune to an ex-
cessive reliance on single-com-

modity exports, Ohmans viewed
with pleasure “increasing signs
of economic diversification in Lat-
in American countries.

Describing the detrimental ef-
fects of unchecked population
growth rate has been high too.”
Consequently, he lamented, “the
actual improvement in living con-
ditions has not been great.”

Briefly, the V State Department
official described the role the Unit-
ed States has played in solving
Latin America’s problems. “The
United States,” he declared, “has
lent money to improve the infra-
structure of Latin America and to
improve the quality of Latin Amer-
ican education.”

However, Ohmans disparaged
the‘ importance of American aid.

“THE UNITED STATES is not in the business of guiding the destinies of
countries."-—John Ohmans.

“The assistance of the United .
States,” he argued, “is not the con-
trolling factor in a country’s de-
velopment. ”

The Latin American specialist

‘rejected the suggestion that the

United States can put pressure on
military dictatorships by curtail-

, ing its aid, once again softpedaling

the influence of the coldssus.
“United States leverage,” he main-
tained, “is very slight.”

Actually, Ohmans argued that

ships by exerting economic pres,-.:

sure. “The United States,” he af-

firmed, “is not in the business of  _;r'
guiding the destinies of countries.” . 

Abruptly shifting keys, the State _ ..jl'='—jIlfj_
Department official defended the ‘ 7,-1. 
United States’ economic boycott. , 
of Cuba and American interven-  
tion in the Dominican Republ_ic.. .3
Discussingthe latter at length,‘.he_' .5, 
distinguished between the first ‘iv’
and second landings of American 

troops.

The initial landing, he contend- ’ . .
ed, “was necessary to protect 
American citizens.” The second, 
he argued, “was necessary to sep- f 
arate the contending factions in 

the Dominican Republic.”

Refusing to predict the future 
course of inter-American rela-

tions, . Ohmans nevertheless was
optimistic. He pointed out that

President Nixon’s first White ;.
House visitor was the secretary- .

general of the OAS. And he crypti-

cally confided, “President Nixon .  
considers Latin America to be at» '~f
very important part of the world.”  

Diplomat-in-Resident John Oh-
mans will be staying at the Uni-

versity, for six more months and ’

would be delighted to talk with any-
one who needs advice or informa-
tion. His office is located at 203
Bruce Hall.

 The U.S.  A Problem

Even 6400 Miles Apart

by GEORGE LIES
Contributing Editor

Vietnam and Peru seem to have the same problem — the United

‘ States.

Just recently, I spoke with a serviceman discharged from the Army.
He had spent one year of his life in Vietnam, and his view of the war

was interesting:

First, he was against the war
militarily. He said the war was
being fought with archaic ideas
usedin Europe during World War

 “II; these‘ theories being similar
: ‘ to the type when Britain’s “mighty
-‘ 600” rode into the valley of death.

Secondly, he said he would let
history decide whether the war
was “a good cause.” He hoped
that the men and boyswho died
there “did not die for nothing”

" the game: he was drafted, went

‘from a private to PFC, then to
sergeant; he was wounded, earn-

" ed the Purple Heart, the Bronze

"Star, and the Silver Star for her-
“oism in battle.
He realized that the village-
-type Vietnamese didn’t care what
happened (“unless a ‘firefight’

 -broke out in their backyard”).

They only wanted peace, and an
end to the Viet Cong terrorizing

' and the .U.. S. bombing.

Thirdly, and what I consid-
er the viewpoint of many Am-
ericans, he said:

“The villagers don’t realize
the difference between Commun-
ism -— where instead of farming
their own land, they’d be farming

for someone else — and what we’re V
‘  ;_* ;figh,ting for. if , ' , « ’

This is interesting, and no
doubt truthful to an extent. But
what it brings to mind is a sim-
ilar problem in South American,
and how the press media — no
matter how it tries — affects the
viewpoint of the American popu-
la_tion.

In Peru, the government wants
to kick-out what they see as an im-
perialistic invader, naturally the
U. S. in this case.

To Peru’s government, it seems
that, the village-type Peruvians
have been toiling the land for

someone else and not for them- '

selves; This justice is what the
U. S. is fighting for in Vietnam,
according to the servicernan —
that is, give the land, its resour-
ces and its politics, back to the
people. -

The press medias present both
pictures — Vietnam and Peru -
to the populace. And something
like the following will be the re-
sponse: _

“Don’t those people in Vietnam
realize Communism is bad. Bet-

Blue Meanies Screw Draft   Resister

ter dead than red, you know.’
And . . . .

This is interesting, and no
doubt truthful to an extent. A
parallel? Maybe, maybe not, but
it seems that the only difference
between Vietnam and Peru is . . .
about,6400 miles.

RTC Sfolus Still Unclear 

by JOE KOCIUBES

Dianne Ulyon’s article on ROTC (June 17) raises
more questions than it answers. While many stu-
dents and faculty question whether ROTC is an aca-
demic program, Mis,s.",U1yon begins her article by
flatly asserting that “ROTC is a recognized aca-
demic program on the undergraduate level, but stu-
dents in the College of Arts and Sciences do not re-
ceive credits for ‘ROTC courses.” Based upon her
assertion, she then claims that those who do not
agree that ROTC is a non—credit academic program
do not have a clear conception of ROTC’s status. I
believe lt’s called begging the question. A

The question that Miss Ulyon does not raise is,
exactly what is a non-credit academic program?
How does an activity go about attaining this label?
Evidently there are some advantages from _such a

 

 

 

  Policy Statement

IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS The Pitt News has requested that ‘various de-
partments on campus pay a flat rate fee for delivery. of the Pitt News to their 10-
-cations on campus. .

For the forthcoming fiscal year the paper faces 320 per cent rise in print-
ing costs plus additional costs in the overhead and ‘supplementary expenses that

it will incur. In order to help meet these costs we are being forced to eliminate,

drop off points of the Pitt News. We felt that the following drops are reached by
a majority of our student readers: the Student Union, Hillman Library, Cathe-
dral Basement, Towers Lobby, Engineering Hall and the Langley Library.

If we are to continue to cover all other drops we must secure funds for;these-.;

drops. Our driver has requested varioussums to deliver the papers to the drops
and we have divided it between the departments concerned. Because we have no
other alternative we must ask that you help us in this matter. '

 __ This year our allocation by the Student Giﬁemmem Allocations Committee
was substantially cut. The allocation does not ‘realistically reflect the rise in
costs that have incurred. Our only other source of revenue, "advertising, is be-
ing raised, but cannot meet the increased costs. The Allocations Committee felt
that in as much as the faculty does benefit greatly from the Pitt News that they

Please be advised that beginning with the first issue in the Fall term we will
be instituting the following policies concerning publication of announcements in
the Pitt News. Activities on campus will be .published in each and every issue,
however, they must be paid for in advance prior to insertion and will be charged
for at the rate of $1 for under 15 words and $2 for 16-30 words. This payment will
guarantee placement of your announcement. Display advertising will be charged
at the rate of $1.75 per column inch and contract rates will be available. Classi-
fied advertisements will be charged at the rate of $1 for under 10 words and for
11-20 a $2 charge will be in effect. Publication will continue to be three times

at many more if you can help us solve our problems.

classification. There is a good deal of free space
provided in the Cathedral; the University hires a
bureaucrat to be its “coordinator”; there is an
official place on the freshman orientation program,
etc. It is significant that neigher extra-curricular
activities nor credit academic programs have such
a spot on freshman orientation. So there seems to
be some clear advantages to the rating “non-credit
academic program.”

Miss Ulyon further claims that ROTC is a “rec- I

ognized” non-credit academic program. Recognized
by whom? The Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)
didn’t grant that status—it merely voted to remove
credit from ROTC. (The arguments presented by
most of the proponents of the ‘move were based

4 around the contention that ROTC was not academic.)

The FAS Council did not grant ROTC this privileged

status, nor did the Undergraduate Council of the” L

College. As far as the College is concerned, what
does it mean to say that ROTC is a “recognized”
academic program? Miss Ulyon was too busy speak-
ing of misconceptions to explain. (Perhaps it is pos-

give credit to existing courses, that is their busi-

ness. Indeed, does Rose intend, to negotiate with the ~

Chandler and the boys are incompetent to look for
acceptable courses, one wonders what they are‘ do-
ing in the front of classrooms—-or in their embroid-
ered uniforms. Certainly, we don’t have to pay Rose
to do the military’s leg work.

Or might it be the case that Rose is indeed   _

gotiating something? Neither the Undergraduate
Council, the FAS Council nor the FAS authorized
Rose to negotiate for them. The Zasloff-Cottam
committee has been charged by the dean of FAS to
investigate the ROTC alternatives.

Perhaps Rose is negotiating not new College
courses, but non-College courses that he hopes the
College can be pressured into accepting. Maybe he
figures these courses will be allowed for credit as
part of the 12 non-College credits that College stu-
dents may take. Thus, he could sneak in the back
door what the faculty forbade in the front door. (In-

cidentally, this approach was discussed at the Ui@-5-

dergraduate Council and rejected before the Coun-
cil made its final recommendation for de-crediting
ROTC.')

Most important-of all, Rose should tell the Uni-
versity community what. he really is negotiating,
who instructed him to negotiate, upon what legiti-
mate authority he is negotiating, and why "he is en-
gaged in negotiations at a time before the faculty
group (a group that was not even chosen by the fac-
ulty, but by the administration‘) has even made an
unofficial recommendation. Would a little honesty
and openness really hurt Rose’s wheeling-and-deal-
ings that much? The University community is en-
titled to an explanation.



Don’t be fooled by the beatitude ending
in Yellow Submarine, the Blue Meanies are
still around. When 51‘ Pepperlanders
marched in front of the Federal Building
on Grant St. one Tuesday morning, the Blue
Meanies were on hand, ready to fight.

The Pepperlanders, dreary-eyed from
lack of sleep, among other things, were
supporting an unknown martyr, who, at
6:45 a.m., refused induction into a military
machine which thrives on atrocity. They
were heavily armed with posters, peace
flags, and peace buttons, and a good sense
of direction.

Inside the Federal Building, the martyr
for peace became the target of other ob-

noxious Blue Meanie tactics. He was sup-
posed to report to the 17th floor to fill out
forms and to take a physical, but the Blue
Meanies only let him ride the elevator to
the 12th floor.

While the Pepperlanders marchedin a
circle that occupied no more than 20
cement squares on the sidewalk. the Blue
Meanies were uniting. Ten hateful men in
blue stood a few feet from the protestors.
and waited impatiently for the word.

The Blue Meanies were smiling warp-
ed smiles, thinking about how lucky they
were to be part of the most heavily armed
minority in the country. They were itching
to use their billy clubs and guns, so that

they could show the Pepperlanders what
most decent folk thought of peace-creeps.

The Blue Meanies had strong support.
“Go to Europe.” screamed one war-happy
mongrel who couldn’t understand why any-
one would want peace. "Go-to Europe."

A nark also showed up, but he only
stayed long enough to take pictures of all
the male Pepperlanders. General Hershey
likes to know who the trouble-makers are
that threaten to illegalize mass murder. a
Blue Meanie past-time.

The Blue Meanies have this rather pe-
culiar idea that peace-creeps are effemin-
ate. and so they easily forced the Pepper-

landian to walk the next five flights of
stairs, probably so that they could look up
his pants.

While the perverted Blue Meanies im- a
agined Gypsy Rose Lee walking,up the_

steps, a real girl was not permitted to ac-

, company the martyr.

“They thought I was going to distribute
leaflets to read,” said the martyr’s girl
friend, showing us a book that she was
carrying. “They let other girls up therel”

The martyr's girl friend came outside

and joined the Pepperlanders until the 

march ended, one hour after it began. But

in the end, neither the Pepperlanders nor 4' " '
the Blue Meanies were victorious.

Admissions Evoiuofed

by CARLA SYDNEY STONE
Staff News Writer

Two years ago, March 20,
1967 John Leech, assistant di-
rector of admissions issued a mem-
orandum to academic deans, di-

‘rectors, department heads and

faculty on the subject “Re-evalua-
tion of Policies and Procedures

' for the admission of Physically"

Handicapped Students.” Leech
had hoped that faculty mem-
bers would give their “gut rea-
tions” to the prospect of teaching
handicapped students. Not only
was the reaction to the request
sparse, the suggestions received
were totally nonrealistic (es-
pecially from the Engineering
School which has yet to deal with
a handicapped student. I

When questioned about this
year’s incoming class, he said that
five formal applications were
made for admission. Of the five,
three were admitted, one was re-
jected because credentials were
not submitted in time, and the

other rejected because he need-

ed “more care‘ than the Univer-
sity is equipped to provide.”

Leech admitted that five stu-
dents is a “very small percentage
of those who can do college level
work and of that small eligable
percentage‘ who do apply to col-
lege, an even smaller per--
centage apply to Pitt. “When
asked why, he said that the Uni-
versity has an informal policy
stating that a student shall-be ad-
mitted to the University as long
as that student does not require
any extra care from the Univer-
sity. It has been handed down
from administrator to adminis-
trator (there is one copy of it in
the admissions office). But there
is no widely published statement

the handicapped.

Leech feels that over the next
few years the pool of handi-
capped seeking admission to the
University will increase because

Iriresponsiibilities of University Students Caused

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

College students are not responsible
for themselves. Society screams it. Parents
lament it. Administrators proselytize it. The

trouble is that it is true.

Responsibility can not be instantly donned
like lovebeads or taken into the bloodstream

in one shot like heroin.
It is a character trait
that develops from use
and experience.

Richt now at this Uni-
versity and in all the
colleges and high-
schools in the country,
students are being starv-
ed of the important as-
set of learning from
their “mistakes.” I

There “mistakes” are avoided for them.

What is the rationale for requirements?

The students are‘ infuriated by

not understand these perver-

of the secrecy. We want things
to be conducted in an open man-
ner. We want to be confronted
and treated as human beings.

In our attempts to avoid be-

the action that SG carries out is
in secret. Most of the SG Sen-

are in the dark as to what SG is
doing.-

At the beginning of the sum-
mer, the Senators were sent a
letter from SG asking for their
help during- the term. Unfor-
tunately, the Senators are rarely
consulted or invited to take part

So what did you do about it? One imi-r

Freedom to think and act as oneself must ,
begin when one’s choices are most important.
Adulthood (whatever that means) cannot be

and rebels, wall-flowers and
coquettes.

Many of the freshmen were
exciting and excited; a few
were boring and bored. Many
were righly human; a few were
barely so.

The freshmen reacted in dif-
ferent ways to“ what they saw
and heard during the four days
they spent in Oakland. Each in-
dividual judged the University
from his own perspective and
came to his own conclusions.

Jenny Dorman, a white witch
from Brentwood, sensed clair-
voyantly the free atmosphere
which permeates the Univer-
sity. “Everyone does what he
wants to do,” the pretty blonde
noticed, “and that’s fine with-
everybody else.”

Ken Anderson, an especially
human and modern guy from
Knoxville, expressed the same
idea in different words. “You
can do your thing,” he observed,
“without people jumping all
over you.”_

Most of the freshmen reacted

favorably to the University.
“I love it!” Julie Christobec
happily exclaimed. Similarly,

Ken Anderson remarked, “I’m
digging what‘I see. It’s a good
scene.” '

Linda Yoest, "stressing her sin-
cerity, described the University
in cloying terms and claimed to
be delighted with “its gorgeous
campus and attractive atmos-
phere.” ‘ .

Virtually all the freshmen were
impressed by the congeniality
of the people they met be-
tween Forbes and Fifth Avenues.
“Everyone’s so nice!” cooed
sun-tanned Penny Cox of Phila-
delphia._“The people are ‘so friend-
ly! ” Julié Christobec exclaimed.

{But Vicki Abraham and Char-

ylene Rychlinski struck a sour

note. ,“Nobody talks to you,”
the two girls complained, as they
huddled together in a c or n e r of
the Student Union. “I don’t know

‘about the people,” Charlene hesi-

tated. “They’re not too friendly,
if you ask me.”

Reactions to orientation it-
self ran the gamut from lavish
praise to pointed criticism. Sal-
lie Jacobs of Houston,_ Pa.
thought orientation was “really
great.” “You meet a lot of new
people,” she yelled, asher room-
mate hustled" her” away»: three
minutes before their curfew be-

Members of the Duquesne Club should use their “power” to put an
end to war, according to Mr. William E. Sypher. ’

Sypher, an instructor of speech at the University was one of ap-
proximately 10 demonstrators arrested Friday, May 23, at the ‘downtown

The demonstration was plan-
ned to call attention to “the fact
that the Duquesne Club is a seat
of power downtown, perhaps more
powerful than Congress.”

“There are strong connections

tics in this country. If they could
bring an end to the war we would
be delighted. These companies

» which profit from the war haven’t

been confronted. We felt the time
had come when they should
lose their virginity and be con-
fronted.”

The 29-year old Point Breeze
resident spoke to Herbert Stein’s

. English 145 class about the ac- I

tivities at the Duquesne Club.
An undergraduate in chemistry
at Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology, he is now completing his
dissertation in Communications
Research at the University.

Asked about police reaction,
Sypher answered that, “The po-
lice were on the whole quite gen-
tle. And the members of the Du-
quesne Club (most of them) acted
like wounded animals.” He said
the group was surprised at the
latters reactions.

“We expected the Club mem-
bers to be suave businessmen and
‘just ignore us. Instead they real-
ly got excited and started yelling

and screaming.

“I said to them,.‘Can’t we talk
to you about using your influ-
ence?’ They screamed, “Get out
of here you hippies, you stink.”

Sypher admitted that the de-
monstrators had given advance
notice to the newspapers. The ac-
tion, he explained, “was intended
to be a publicity stunt,” be-
cause in order to have their
voices heard “people have been
pushed to this.”

“We have no definite plans at
this point. We will look into any-
thing which smacks of a two-
close relationship between de-
fense industries and govern-
ment. I would hope there would be
actions by others.

 

Editor's Note:

The following observation
was etched out by a bright young
guy named Keith whom I met
at disorientation. I feel it merits
publication to all members of the
academic community, since this

is how one of our incoming
freshmen views his next four
years here.

By my definition learning is in-
nate; a constant. Learning is not
only continuous, but undefinable.
This may seem ambiguous to
the reader, but I will attempt to
explain.

Any restricted rhetoric about ex-
perience is a negation of that ex-
perience. Therefore, through
piles of this bullshit, I say that.
learning is experience. Not only
experience, but even non—ex-
perience.» By non—experience I‘
mean wishes or fantasies or even
unfulfilled experiences.
thought is an experience.

Purposeful wishes and fantasies
are more important than purpose-
ful living. But even this is an

Learning Is Experience 

understatement, for indeed I

"FEEL that my dreamful condi-
tions bring more enjoyment or.

even meaning than “living.”

But that last statement isn’t
really true because my living ex-
periences are dreams. A dream
isn’t some manifestation of in-
ner desire, it’s thought.

I have spent what ‘seems to be
a millenium thinking and/or
dreaming of learning. I used to

~. feel that learning could only be

obtained through others experi-
ences as they are written in books
or told to me by my friends and
overseerers. Now I have the
exact opposite knowledge, but
now I can realize that both ideas
are exactly the same except that
they are- phrased and worded
differently. Physic remember-
ances are now my past. This mere
phrase has changed my total at-
titude towards knowledge. A11
that can be learned or derived
from books is a kind of factual
-underlining of your own thoughts.

The phenomenon of my oneness

   

of learning has: allowed me-?_._._t
erupt into chaotic rhetoric,i_siue
as the junk written on this pap
which also frees my mind,1‘fr
words and allows sensations,
replace them. ‘

I assume that anyone who woul

pick up this paper to r.ead__thisjl

has had the same realization that
I had. ,Even writing this pape
is a worthwhile sensation althoug
it says nothing. But that is.th
meaning of learning. ~ ‘
