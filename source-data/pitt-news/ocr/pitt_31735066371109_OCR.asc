On Defense

Eyewitnesses testify for players

By John Gambescia

Pitt football player Dennis

Atiyeh and former player Dave Puz-
zuoli finished presenting their
defense yesterday on criminal
charges stemming from an alterca-
tion with several Pittsburgh police
officers last February.

Each side will present its closing
arguments to the jury today, after
which Judge Loran Lewis will
instruct the jury on the application
of the law to the facts.

Monday’s testimony included two
key witnesses for the defense. Pitt
soccer player Carl Johnson and
swimmer Shirlan Locke both wit-
nessed the incident.

Both witnesses testified that they
saw Atiyeh and Puzzuoli struggling
with two police officers when they
approached the scene. Johnson said
that the defendants received contin-
uous blows to the head with night-
sticks as they were dragged toward
the police van.

“At times it appeared as if Puz-
zuoli was unconscious and didn‘t
know where he was, but the police
just kept on hitting him," Johnson
said.

“At one point, I felt a stick hit my
shin, so I moved to the Towers steps
to get out of their range."

One of the main controversies in
the case was whether or not Puzzuoli
picked up Officer DeVelma Cole-
man and threw her to the ground.
Johnson testified that he observed
the entire incident, and did not see
Puzzuoli pick up Coleman.

“I did see Coleman fall on her
butt, but it seemed like she was
knocked down by the moving
crowd," Johnson said. “After she
went down, she got right back up

Inside Today

and began beating Puzzuoli. again."

Locke, who was walking with
Johnson at the time of the incident,
offered identical testimony.

Dr. Joseph Maroon, a neurosur-
geon at Presbyterian University
Hospital, examined Puzzuoli sev-
eral days after the incident. He testi-
fied that Puzzuoli had suffered a
fractured fourth cervical vertebra, a
fractured wrist, several deep cuts to
the head and dog bites on the chest.

“The injuries were definitely
severe,” Maroon said, “but I felt that
with proper care they would heal by
themselves with no major
complications."

Atiyeh and Puzzuoli were the
final witnesses to testify. Atiyeh tes-
tified that he is still uncertain why

the police approached Puzzuoli and
him to begin with.

“All of a sudden I saw Officer
Metz grab Dave’s shirt and say Let‘s
go, m----- f----. I‘ve seen enough of
you tonight, you‘re coming with
me‘," Atiyeh said.

‘Puzzuoli testified that he was also
puzzled about the officers‘ motives
behind the arrest.

“Dennis and I were told to move
on by Officer Wind down in front of
the Wooden Keg, and I thought that
was the end of everything," Puzzuoli
said. “I didn't want any trouble, but
just wanted to know why they
wanted to take me away."

Puzzuoli said that after he had
been struck continuously with night
sticks, the scene became unclear to
him. He remembers being thrust
inside the police van with blood all
over his face and arms.

“I can't remember much of what
happened once inside the van,” Puz-
zuolisaid. “I just remember that
Dennis was wiping my face of the
blood and saying that he still didn‘t
understand what was happening.”

United
Faculty
prepares

peﬁﬁon

See re1ate.d._photo, page 2

By Michele Rhodes
The Pitt News

The United Faculty (UF) will peti-
tion‘ the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tio,ns Board (PLRB) for an election
to decide on collective bargaining.
Philip Wion, president of the United
Faculty, said at a press conference
yesterday that over 650 signed
authorization cards would be sub-
mitted with the petition.

The cards were collected by UF
during the last two years in an
attempt to move the faculty in the
Provost area closer to unionization
and collective bargaining. Over 1200

faculty members representing all‘

university schools except law and
the health related sciences make up
the existing unit.

By signing these cards, a majority
of faculty members in the Provost

area have signaled their intent to

vote for collective bargaining ‘should
an,election take place. They have
.also acknowledged UF as their bar-
gaining agent, according to Al
Fondy, president of the Pennsylva-
nia chapter of the American Federa-
tion of Teachers.

“Everyone should be aware that
the authorization cards signed were
what are known as hard cards,“
Fondy said.

He said using these cards repre-
sents serious commitment on the
part of the faculty to collective bar-
gaining and to the UF as their agent
of choice.

The ‘UF reached its goal of signed
authorization cards in November of
[983 and, according to Wion,
approached the administration
requesting a consent election. The
Pennsylvania Public Employee
Relations Act provides for such elec-
tions if both management and labor
agree to it.

“We were hopeful that the chan-
cellor and the trustees would join
us," Wion said.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
responded to Wion in a letter dated
November 29, 1983: “As you recall,
it has been the position of this uni-
versity that unionization of the
faculty is not in the best interest of
the university and its faculty
members. I support this view.”

“Not too many faculty are happy
that the chancellor takes upon him-
self to determine what is in the best
interests of the faculty,” said Wion.

There have not been any changes
in the administration’s position, he
said.

hysics society receives training awar

By Ron Smutny
The Pitt News

A workshop series intended to
educate high school students and the
public on various aspects of physics
will be conducted by Pitt's chapter
of the Society of Physics Students,
which has won a national award to
cover its expenses for the project.

The annual Marsh W. White
Awards are given by the American
Institute of Physics to help fund
student-oriented projects that pro-
mote interest in physics among stu-
dents and the general public. Pitt has
won" the award, which was increased
this year to $85, in each of the past
four years.

Pitt is one of 509 colleges and uni-
versities nationwide that is eligible

to apply for the awards named after ‘

White, who gave more than 40 years
of service to Sigma Pi Sigma, the
physics honor society. He is emeri-
tus professor of physics at Penn
State and is also a past president of
the American Association of Phys-
ics Teachers.

This year's project has been
entitled “High School Interaction
Program and Women in Science
Conference“ and will be conducted
at area high schools throughout the
term. I  ‘ A

The workshops will consist prim-
arily of videotape presentations for
juniors and seniors at local high
schools who are interested in learn-
ing how they may pursue careers in

physics, according to adviser Dr.
Julia Thompson of the physics and
astronomy department.

Some of the areas scheduled to be
covered are the availability of female
role models in science, aspects of
particular fields of science and other
points of interest to potential scient-
ists. Some of the workshops will also
discuss resumes and salaries.

Most of the group’s award money
will be used for renting the video-
tapes. The physics department also
contributes to the program, Thomp-
son said, by donating a great deal of
secretarial andiadministrative assist-
ance. Pitt’s advising and career
counseling centers are also helpful in
coordinating various aspects of the
program, according to Thompson.

Thompson is especially proud of

the students, who drafted the prop-
osal and budget plan themselves.

“It’s really the students, not me,‘
Thompson said. “I'm just their
adviser."

Although the programs are bene-
ficial to students, they are also
worthwhile to lay persons by allow-
ing them to better understand the
world of physics.

“The intention is to encourage
appreciation of physics with the
community at large," Thompson
said.

Although these workshops are
expected to provide much informa-
tion to the public, Thompson
believes that the Pitt students will
benefit as well.

“They get to see the things they’ve
learned being passed on,” Thomp-

9

son said. Involvement in the society
may also help the students obtain
positions in the Pennsylvania Junior
Academy of Science workshops.
They also benefit from the expe-
rience in human relations, proposal
writing and project planning,
Thompson said.

“They’re helping to educate others
and themselves while having a lot of
fun,” Thompson said.

The other chapters that received
White awardswthis year for their
physics education programs were
Fordham University, Jacksonville
University, North Carolina A&T
State University, Southwestern
Oklahoma State University, Tho-
mas More College and Western
Carolina University.

Apple Computer lnc.‘s newest
entrntry into the microcomputer
race, the Macintosh, will be the
highlight of a presentation co-
sponsored by the Microcompu-
ter Users Group and the Student
Microcomputer User Group on
Feb. 2 at 8 p.m. in Room 169
Clapp Hall.

The latter is a new student
group formulated late last term
as a forum in which students can
learn more about microcomput-
ing and are provided with a
chance to offer input into the
future of academic computing
here.

The focus of the presentation,
according to Apple executive
Bob Longo, will be the Macin-
tosh, which was unveiled yester-
day ‘atan Apple stockholders‘
meeting. The Macintosh has

already received the attention of
academic institutions with the
formation of the Apple Univer-
sity Consortium, composed of 24
major universities including
Carnegie-Mellon University.
Apple estimates that by the end
of I984, at least 50,000 Macin-
tosh computers will be placed on
college campuses nationwide.
Computers will be installed in
campus libraries and dormitories
and will be available for general
use by students and faculty at the
member institutions. Under the
‘ agreement with Apple, each uni-

versity will be expected to
develop new courseware
(instructional software) on

Apple products and to share
information with other consor-
tium members.

While not a member of the

Apple Inc. to display latest micro

consortium, Pitt will be looking
at the Macintosh and many other
microcomputers as part of the
university's commitment to an
advanced computing/communi-
cations system, said Dr. Thomas
Neudecker, chairman of the
Remote Job Entry’s Microcom-
puter Working Group.

Neudecker added that the uni-
versity has to plan support for
one or more access options in the
design of the system.

The student group is an exten-
sion of the Microcomputers
Users Group, a broad-based
group with an academic orienta-
tion. The group regularly spon-
sors forums on topics of
computer interest.

Domestic: security
chief warns of terrorism

By Michael Weinman
The Pitt News

The two biggest challenges to
domestic security are foreign spies
and terrorists. This was the message
brought by William Webster, Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
director, to an assembly of the
World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh
yesterday afternoon.

The meeting was held in the ball-
room of the Pittsburgh Hilton
Hotel. This was the first meeting of
the World Affairs Council for 1984
and was attended by an estimated
crowd of 600, including students
from local public schools.

Webster is a former judge of the
U.S. District Court of Appeals for
Eastern Missouri and U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

Mr. Webster was introduced to
the audience by William Boyd,
former head of the World Affairs
Council. Boyd prefaced Webster’s
address by saying that “in this day
and age, when the work of terrorists
and other criminals is so imagina-
tive, the work of an effective FBI is
needed more than ever.”

Webster stated that above all
other domestic law enforcement
problems, no two issues so domi-
nated the FBI as containingterrorist
activities committed within the U.S.
and eliminating hostile foreign
intelligence officers working in the
US.

Webster said that the most effec-
tive means of suppressing terrorists
is to apprehend them through non-
aggressive methods. “Repressive
means of dealing with terrorists is
just what they (the terrorists) hope
to elicit,” Webster added, “for this
undermines the respectability of the
government.”

Webster proposed that even
though terrorists and terrorist activ-
ities are “more apparent to the

contracts that can be

FBI director

American people now than the days
of the Weathermen and the Black
Panthers,” he does not believe that
terrorist activities have increased».
“There is not an increase in terrorist
activities in the U.S., but an increase
in the awareness by Americans of
terrorism."

Webster said that terrorism is on
the decline in the U.S. Webster
added that most of the terrorist
groups operating in the U.S. are not
Middle Eastern groups, but groups
operatingyout of the Western hemis-

threatened, FBI

phere. The major exceptions to this
rule are the Armenian terrorist
groups.

Webster said there were only 3|
terroristic activities in the U.S. in
I983. Two-thirds of these acts,
Webster claimed, were from Carri-
bean and anti—Castro groups. Webs-
ter cited the suppression of
Armenian terrorists as a success
story for the FBI. He said there were
no successful Armenian attacks in
the U.S. last year and compared this
to the more than 5 attacks in I982.

Webster announced the creation
of a new anti-terrorist branch of the
FBI. The new squad of 50 FBI
agents were trained by the armed
forces and required a special act by
the president to be completed.
Webster cited this and the installa-
tion of barricades in front of the
White House as new measures to
finally stop terrorist activities such
as the bombing of the Capitol last
year.

Webster said that most foreign
agents were after U.S. high tech
devices and that “because we live in a
free environment  we are con-
cerned with the thousands of per-
sonnel that work on defense
contracts that can be tempted, or
bribed" to reveal classified
information.

Webster denied that the FBI was
involved in any illegal domestic
espionage and stated, “the FBI is
involved in no wiretaps that have
not been previously sanctioned by a
court of law.”

Webster blamed the American
press as making America “the great-
‘est theatre world for these people
[terrorists] to get publicity and pos-
sible financial support." Webster
cited the American funding of the
Irish civil war as an example ofthis.
Webster added thanks to the Ameri-
can press “the Armenian terrorists
have been using the U.S. to continue
to fight a war that took place almost
80 years ago.”

State of the Union

Tonight, President Reagan will deliver his State of the Union
Address. There appear to be several parallel developments
between hisunion and ours — though it is up to you to decide
which are of a more urgent nature. Disclaimer thus dipensed
with; our State of the Union Address: ’

The president and the nation seem to be plagued with contin-
uous false alarms of nuclear attack, including the one through
which Pennsylvania went earlier this month. Our union too has
its own problems with false alarms. ' J T’

The fire alarms in the Student Union still don't work prop-
erly. At any time of the week, we can expect to see some
maintenance crew member staring into the control box with a

look of absolute desperation on his face. Lights ﬂash off and on

in front of him accompanied by the gentle strains of a blaring
siren.

The president has continually complained the media don‘t
treat him fairly. Like so many of his predecessors, Reagan has
tried new ways to stop administration members from speaking
to the press and revealing unauthorized information. Our
union has also had its problems with leaks, though of a differ-
ent nature.

Reagan has been accused of setting back Soviet and U.S.
peace efforts by resurrecting much of the rhetoric used during
the Cold War. Our union has had its problems with a cold war.
The recent spell of freezing temperatures caused a sprinkler
head (the fire alarm system again) to freeze. The sprinkler
broke, effectively flooding the lower level of the union.

From a statistical standpoint, Reagan has tried to persuade
us to believe the country is getting better. He has tried to create
a healthy business climate and present a strong defensive pos-
ture so that the U.S. at least has the appearance of being
stronger. Unfortunately, very few Americans have been able to
take advantage of the president's health program.

Student Union locations that are most frequented received a
very pleasing restoration. The problems that remain, though,
with the new union are real. The university cannot allow com-
placency to set in and halt.the progress that has been made.
Most of the building looks great and is a far more efficient use
of space than was the old design. For those of you on the eighth
and ninth ﬂoors, however, just wait for the “trickle up" theory
due to be discussed at the next Board of Trustees meeting.
Those of you who don‘t understand that last sentence, see for
yourself. Stick your fingers in your ears and take the elevator, if
there are any working.

i A Right to Vote  

In March, 1976, after a full year of hearings with the Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board, in which Pitt and three separate
faculty organizations spent a total of $350,000 in legal fees, 60
percent of the faculty in the Provost’s area voted against
unionization. ‘~\_w_ l

Because Pitt's United Faculty union announced yesterday
that it will ‘file a request with the Labor Board for another
faculty election on the issue, it is reasonable to expect such an
election in the near future. The administration, however, has
indicated that it will oppose such a vote and will spend as much
university money as is necessary to block it.

Both sides are gearing up for what promises to be another
long and costly legal battle. It has become clear that the univer-
sity's commitment to spending public funds to block an elec-
tion is unfortunate. The administration is pursuing an
undemocratic policy on an issue that should be decided by
faculty members only. ‘

When an employer states that collective bargaining is not in
‘the best interests of the employer or the employees, he over-
steps his bounds. A democratic vote on the issue offering
professors the opportunity to accept or reject unionization is

the only'fair solution. . ‘

Letters To The Editor

I read with interest several aspects

of the Jan.l8 edition. In the begin-
ning of the column on page ﬁve,
under the title “From the Foul
Line," it is declared by author Mark
Sindler that the “Book Center...[is] a
role model of text-book pricing con-
spiracies." At the other end of his
foul line, Mr. Sindler alludes to “half
truths.“

Here we have a case of the
contributing editor of The Pitt News
accusing, in print, the Book Center
of being involved in a conspiracy
without even a single reference to the

alleged “half truths," let alone any
facts to support such a serious
charge. In fact, no mention of con-
spiracies appears thereafter in this
foul journalistic masquerade.
Freedom of expression is guaran-
teed, but there is no freedom to lie in
print or to declare someone’s guilt
(as Mr. Sindler does collectively of
the Book Center), especially when
he cites no facts. There is also no
freedom to manipulate journalism
as a vehicle for self-promotion.
This latter activity was properly
scored by letter writer Nancy Weiner

Writer manipulates the news

(page four of the same.issue). She
alerts your readers to the fact that
Richard Schnap wrote a story on
“punk“ music and was allowed to
refer repeatedly to his own band,
without your readers’ being told of
such an important connection.

This is an outright deception, and
in my view, such journalistic activity
is every bit as destructive to the
image of your fine university as van-
dalism is to its property.

Civil rights: lip service

The Reagan Administration’s
debasement of the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights was hardly unpredic-
table; it merely reaffirms the com-
mitment of Reagan and his
supporters to pursue regressive poli-
cies. Reagan's revamped commis-
sion recently voted against racial
quotas A in job hiring, otherwise
known as affirmative action.

At the same moment he is con-
demning affirmative action, Reagan
gives speeches ardently defending
the civil rights of everyone, espe-
cially those most affected by this

— policy. .

There is a deeper significance
behind the contradictory sentiments
of Ronald Reagan, who gives blacks
and other minorities a rhetorical pat
on the back by inundating them with
glittering generalities like “justice“
and “equality“ while simultaneously
picking their pockets. This attitude
illustrates the prime contradiction in
both past and present American
public policy — words speak louder
than actions.

When slavery in this country was
abolished, first by a proclamation
and then by a constitutional amend-

ment, blacks were no better — if not

~worse —— off than they had been

before their “freedom." American
blacks were not really freed until the
19605, when racist oppression was
firmly challenged by men and
women of action determined to
force change. ,

The Constitution, along with new
civil rights legislation, opened the
gates for progress in race relations,
but by themselves, they are impo-
tent. Imagine the absurd scenario of
a band of civil rights workers waving
signed and notarized government
documents in the faces of racist res-
taurant owners or Southern sheriffs.

Are not heat, food, adequate
housing and overall material com-
fort civil rights also? What do the
promises of Ronald Reagan mean
without anything concrete to back
them up? Affirmative action is
intended to give minorities a chance
to better their lives materially on a
scale comparable with that of the
rest of the nation. There is too much
catching up for the persecuted to do
to leave their future in the hands of
Reagan, who demonstrates time and
time again his affinity for social Dar-

v

university affiliation.

Film major set for preview

By Steve Shussett
The Pitt News

The faculty of the film studies
program will submit a proposal
tomorrow at the College of Arts and
Sciences Council meeting to request
that the program become a full
major. If accepted, a bachelor of arts
degree in film study would replace
the current certificate program.

According to Dr. Lucy Fischer,
director of the program, the major
would eliminate the need for self-
designed majors in that area and le-
gitimize the course work.

determine distribution require-
ments. Students would need to com-
plete 36 credits for the major,
including 12 credits in a related field.

Pitt English professor Dan .
Polan, who instructs in the program,
said the new major requirements are
not extreme.

The requirements, he explained,
show the major is “a serious major
rather than frivolity."

The present film studies program
is similar in content and quality to
other prestigious film programs
throughout the country, such as
those of the University of Iowa,
Purdue University and New York
University.

At Pitt, the faculty consists of [4
professors. This includes nine
instructors affiliated with the lan-
guage departments and some from

The program began in 1975 and i

has made tremendous gains since
then, according to Fischer. Former
program director William Judson

contributed to the program’s success
when he hired faculty members
(Fischer, Polan and Jane Feuer)
who had specific graduate training
in cinema.

The program was nationally rec-
ognized last year at the annual con-
ference of the Society for Cinema
Studies. The society is the foremost
academic organization dealing with
film studies, and it was an opportun-
ity for Pitt’s program to be recog-
nized, Fischer said.

Fischer also said no additional
funding would be needed at this time
to expand the program but added
that the amount of grants and other

Journal follows evolutionary psychology

By Catherine Save!
For The Pitt News

The Journal of Evolutionary Psy-
chology is one of the better kept

A secrets in the writer’s market here in

the Pittsburgh area. Coordinated by
Dr. Paul Neumarkt, its editor in
chief, the journal has been in exist-
ence since I979. Inlanuary of 1983, it
was cited by the American Psycho-
logical Association as one ofthejour—
nals bearing its specific recognition
in intellectual standards and quality.
The J ournal has also been recognized
by the Modern Language
Association.

Dr. Neumarkt presently teaches
advanced literature at Washington
and Jefferson College. Prior to this,
he was a full professor at Duquesne
University, where he taught German
language and literature in both grad-
uate and undergraduate programs.

Thejournal’s history and that ofits
roof organization, the Institute of
Evolutionary Psychology, Inc., goes

begins in Stamford, Conn., where a
man by the name of Theodore
Schroeder founded the institute. He
originally was an attorney who
became disillusioned with the prac-
tice of law and the legal system. He
then dedicated a number of years to
the study ofpsychology and has to his
credit over 20 books he authored in
the fields of law, psychology and
social issues.

Schroeder originally dreamed of
thejournal as a “survey ofpsycholog-
ical literature” dedicated to the
psycho-evolutionary process that
would give scholars from all fields of
thought and study a chance to write
and expand the general level of
awareness.

Schroeder would not live to see his
dream fulfilled. He died in I953. Yet
the institute did not die with him. A

--Paul Neumarkt

disciple of his, Arnold Maddaloni,
took it upon himselfto maintain the
institute and its work.

Maddaloni empathized with

Schroeder's aspirations in that he too E

pursued the study of psychology. He
is the only surviving disciple of
Schroeder.

Maddaloni'originally met Neu-
markt while the latter was living in
Stamford. Neumarkt then moved to
the Pittsburgh area and in I979 was
appointed by Maddaloni to take on
the position of editor in chief of the
Journal of Evolutionary Psy-
chology.

Evolutionary psychology, accord-
ing to Arnold Maddaloni,iexecutive
director emeritus of the institute, is a
“theory ofthe subjective changes that
go on within individuals in the course
of their psychologic maturing." In

A SEMINAR FOR ADMINISTRATORS, FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS

ogy, medicine, psychology, psychia-
try, education, industry, labor and
other words, evolutionary psychol-
ogy credits all schools of psychology
in the study of human behavior. This
includes, but doesn't limit itself to,
Alderian, Rogerian, Gestaltist, tran-
sactional, Pavlovian and behavioral
psychology.

It is apt to quote Schroeder in this
context: “All social problems of our
defective human nature...and a bet-
ter social order come not by a change
of social theory but by maturing of
the impulses behind our theories.
Our problems are not matters ofpure
intellect but of immature urges and
conflicting emotions." I

Evolutionary psychology is not
“monistic." Neumarkt states that
“there is a nucleus of truth in any
school." ’

The journal is a podium to which
scholars, students and professionals
can submit articles dealing with the
interaction of art, film and literature
through a psychological approach.
Individuals from many occupations
and lines of thinking, including law,
sociology, government, criminol-

religion represent themselves as
authors in thejournal, which is pub-
lished quarterly. Neumarkt said that
thejournal is not only a basis for the
above but an opportunity for writers
whose articles meet the intellectual
standards and reflect the aspirations

. of the journal.

“It is not the adherence to certain
methods of psychology which is
emphasized, but rather, the quality
of the papers,” Neumarkt said.

These ideals have their origin in a
personal experience of Neumarkt's.
A few years back, Neumarkt himself,
a published author, submitted an
article to a Jungian journal and was
told that his piece exhibited a
“Freudian interpretation” and,
therefore, was not acceptable. Asim-
ilar incident occured later when he
submitted an article to a Freudian
publication and was questioned
regarding allusions to Jung’s collec-
tive unconscious.

“We want to try to create a climate
in which a person can ma‘ture,”Neu-
markt said. “The article submitted
should expand my view of the
world.”

i Polish filmmakers Lech Majewski
and Christopher Burdza will be

_ present at the Pittsburgh premiere of

The Knight (I980), a film written
and directed by Majewski to be
shown on Thursday evening, Jan.
26, at 8 in David Lawrence Hall.
This event is sparked by the film-
makers‘ current project, a proposal
for a film which would feature Pitts-
burgh as a major location.

The Knight tells a story which
begins in a small kingdom in Easten
Europe. Misery and low morale pre-
vail, and instead of doing battle, the
knights of the kingdom buy banners
from the invading Tatars. The
banners are desecrated and pres-
ented to the king who, senile and
unaware of the deception, gives par-
ties in honor of the alleged “victors."

Corruption, hypocrisy and tor-
ture are accepted by all but a young
knight who determines to find a
legendary harp which magically
maintained peace and happiness in
the country before being stolen by
unknown thieves. According to
Janet Maslin of The New York
Times. “Though the mysticism of
the material takes precedence over
its politics, the film's central meta-
phor has pro-Solidarity im-
plications Born in Katowice,
Poland, in I953, Majewski gradu-
ated from the film and television
directing department of the State
College of Film, Theater and TV in

Lodz in I977. While still a student, .

he made a feature called Encore
(I975) and a documentary. Grand
Hotel ( I975), which in I976 won the
Golden Plate Award for the best
etude at the International Review of
School Films in Rzeszow and a prize
for its direction at the Festival of
Film Etudes in Katowice. Majewski
has also published numerous poems
and scripts in addition to two
volumes of poetry. He has since left
Poland and is now making a film in
English. . _

‘Pearl’ ebuts
‘at Fitzgerald

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Syracuse is not supposed to be in
first place in the Big East.

A team who loses three starters of
the caliber of Tony Bruin, Erich
Santifer and Leo Rautins should be
in the second division of the confer
ence, a league where inexperience is
taken advantage of.

V However, the Orangemen have
not only managed to survive, but
have prospered. Through six games,
no Big East squad has defeated
them, and their l2-3 mark surprises

cg, even Syracuse head coach Jim

Boeheim.

“I don’t think we thought about
it,” he said. “We did not know what
to expect. If we would have thought
about it, we would have gotten
scared and been 0-6 instead.”

“I'm suprised that they’re lead-
ing," Pitt head coach Roy Chipman
added.

Syra‘"cuse’s top spot will be con-
tested tonight at 8 p.m. as the

‘ Panther basketball team, fresh off

Q Classic at the Civic Arena last,

two conference victories, clashes
with the Orangemen at the Fitzger-
ald Field House.

The main source of attention for
players and spectators alike is the
Pittsburgh collegiate debut of one
Dwayne “Pearl” Washington.

The 6-2 guard from Brooklyn’s
Boys and Girls High School has
shown that he proves worthy of his
high school awards. Washington. a
consensus All-America and Most
Valuable Player in the Dapper Dan

spring, is tied for the team leadership
in scoring ._with forward Raphael
‘Addison, hitting nearly 18 points per
game. He also leads the conference
in field goal shooting, hitting 69 per-
cent (40-59) for six league games.

Washington’s last second, half-
court heave which beat Boston Col-
lege in the Carrier Dome Saturday
shows the presence few players — let
alone freshmen — have.

“It has been Pearl
this, Pearl that; we
want to take the
game.”

-Billy Culbertson

Although the personnel has
changed, the philosophy has not.
The Orangemen like to run into an
up-tempo, high-scoring offense. It is
up to the Panthers to keep control of
the pace of the game.

“We have to stop them from run-
ning the fast break,” Chipman said.

“We can run,” said assistant coach
Joe DeGregario, who scouted Syra-
cuse, “but we have to do it under
control.”

Pitt must control Syracuse’s run-
ning game, but the Orangemen have
to contend with the force known as
Fitzgerald Field House. Already the
menace to Big East team’s records
has another Top 20 victim in St.
John’s. Pitt looksto make Syracuse
the second this season, and the fifth-
in two years.

“We were prepared last year; we
knew it would be a tough game,”

Boeheim said of Pitt’s upset last‘

year. “Pitt has a good basketball
team and they are capable of beating
anyone. Last year, Pitt just played
better.

“You should be able to play any-
place. Tough places are a part of
college basketball.”

With all this team concept and

home-court advantage talk, though,
the name “Pearl" still remains domi-
nant with the opposition.
" Curtis Aiken has been a player
living with the name Pearl since the
two met at the Empire State Games
in the summer of 1982. Aiken out-
scored Washington 45-43 as Aiken’s

Jelic nears record as Pitt
falls to Bloomsburg, .31-16

8 Ti DI
Thye Piftnﬂewgger

The Panther wrestling team
dropped to 3-5 at the hands of
Bloomsburg State in a meeting» that
ended 31-16 on Sunday at
Bloomsburg.

For Pitt, it was another loss due to
falls, this being the second match in
a row and third of the season in
which the Panthers have given up
four pins.

“In wrestling, there are two cardi-
nal sins. One is not making weight,
and the other is getting pinned," said
head coach Rande Stottlemyer. “We
have been breaking the latter too
many times recently.”

The most heartbreaking loss came
v‘as Joe Bond, who led the match
with just\under 30 seconds left, was
reversed and pinned with seconds to
go by Bloomsburg’s Dan Klinger-
man at 158 lbs.

On a more positive note, Stot-
tlemyer pointed out that the Pan-
thers did pull some victories on a
team that will be ranked I3 in the
next Eastern Mat Polls.

Nellis [at 126 lbs.] lost in a very close
5-4 match.

“As it was, we won four out of 10
matches, which isn’t bad, consider-
ing the team.”

Panther John Hnath got the first
points on the board for Pitt when he
received a default from Blooms-
burg’s John Mossur at 134 lbs.

At [42 lbs., Pitt’s Joe Throckmor-

. ton saw his first action of the year at

that weight and dominated Blooms-
burg’s Don Confort I0-4. Throck-
morton had been the Panther
regular at 134 lbs., but weight prob-
lems forced him up a notch on the
Pitt lineup.

Pitt’s Gary Bolin, the Panthers’
usual I42-pounder, missed the
Bloomsburg match due to injury,
and when he returns, he will battle
Throckmorton to retain his
position.

Panther Jeff Jelic downed
Bloomsburg’s Darrin Evens 12-4 at
167 lbs. The win gives him 68 career
victories, tying him with the all-time
record set by Stottlemyer. r

The final Panther win ofthe after-

noon came at I90 lbs., as Jack’

Uppling beat Bloomsburg’s Steve

injuries, Stottlemyer must contend
with tonight’s trip to Kent State.
“We need this win," he said. ‘‘It’s
not essential to whether we have a
successful season, but we need it to
get back on the winning track. “
“Sure, if we had our best team in
the lineup, we would feel more confi-

dent, but we feel that our other guysfi

can go out and do a good job. The
important thing is we have to pull
together.”

A change in the Panther lineup
may occur at I18 lbs., where Hal
Bolin returns after ‘back problems
had forced him off the mats.

At 142 lbs., with Bolin still out
and illness hampering Throckmor-
ton, freshman Greg Zimmerman
may get the call.

The heavyweight spot may also be
open; an injury to regular starter
Dan Kasperkoski could keep him
out of action. Replacing him will
either be freshman Curtis Conner or
sophomore William Hinton.

Hinton is a latecomer to the wrest-
ling team; he played football for the
Panthers in the fall.

Fazio’s contract extended

Serafino “l“ogc" Fa’/io has been
awarded a two—year contract exten-
sion as head coach of the Panther
football team. Fazio, 45, has three
years remaining on his original con-
tract that he signed in 1982.

Fazio’s two-year record of l7-6-I
matched the mark set by Jackie
Sherrill for most victories by a Pitt
coach in his first two seasons at the
helm. The Panthers have earned
berths in the Cotton and Fiesta
Bowls in back—to-back years under
Fazio, a 1960 Pitt graduate. ‘

“it's a reward for the whole staff.
It looks like we’ll be coaching here
throughout the l980s. It shows sta-
bility in our program." Fazio said.
‘‘It’s important for the players we're
recruiting right now to know that
we‘ll be here. And this is where we
intend to stay.”

Dr. Edward Bozik, Pitt‘s director
of athletics, is equally enthused
about the contract extension.

“We took this step in recognition
of the outstanding coaching job
Foge has done these past two years.
It‘s an indication ofour interest and
desire to have Coach Fazio as a
long-time coach here,” he said. “Our
chancellor, Dr. Wesley Posvar, has
charged us to be winner in whatever
we do at Pitt, and we know that
Foge understands and appreciates
that formula, from an academic as
well as football standpoint. He’s a
Pitt man all the way.,"

Fazio, who was born_ in Daw-
mont, W.V., grew up in near .
Coraopolis. He played for Coach.
John Michelosen while at Pitt in the
late l950’s. He then served as a grad-
uate assistant coach for the Panthers
in 1962, while obtaining his masters

Foge Fazio

degree in education. He went on to
coach high school football at
Ambridge (1963-64) and Coraopolis
(1965-66). He also served as an
assistant coach at Boston Univeristy
(l967) Harvard (1978), Pitt (1969-
72) a . Cincinnati (l973-76).

In 1977, Sherrill named himto the
Pitt staff as a linebacker coach
before promoting him to defensive
coordinator and assistant head
coach in 1979.

Fazio will have his work cut out
for him neat season as Pitt will take
on one of it’s tougher schedules in
recent years. The Panthers open
with Brigham Young and Oklahoma
at Pitt Stadium. The rest of the
home schedule includes games
against. West Virginia, East Carol-
ma, Navy and Tulane. The Panthers
will also face Penn State and the
defending national champions, the
Miami Hurricanes.

Dedication, concentration and
discipline.

There’s no better way to describe
Lisa Shirk, an All-America Lady
Panther gymnast and one of the
coolest customers in collegiate
gymnastics.

After a two year layoff caused by
chronic stress fractures that resulted
in a pair of major ankle operations,
Shirk is attempting a comeback. Her
dedication, which once made her
one the finest gymnasts in the coun-
try, is being put to the test as she tries
once again to attain All-America
honors.

Shirk, a senior, recently broke
Pitt’s individual all-around scoring
record and seems to be on her way.
She is expected to dominate regional
competion and advance into
national competion later this year.

“If I get to Nationals, it'll defi-
nitely be on the bars, maybe in the
all—around if I hit on the beam,”
Shirk said with a confident smile.
“Its a realistic goal.”

“Ten years ago, I made a commit-
ment, I did gymnastics but I took it

lightly,” Shirk said. “ I was involved
with swimming, cheerleading and
Brownies, everything a normal I2-
year-old does. Then I made the deci-
sion to put my all into it."

Her dedication to the sport is eas-
ily seen in the gym when Shirk per-
forms, but she also has another side
that is slightly whimsical and offthe
wall.

At each meet, she goes through a
ritual in which she puts on a scarf,
bunny slippers, tights, sweatshirts
and a shark hat before each event.
She then slowly takes it all off again
and warms up before performing.

“It’s one way she expends some
energy; it’s fun. She’s a little bit wild.
In that way, she‘s a performer; you
expect that kind of thing from an
artist or a dancer. I think gymnasts
border on that,” Lady Panther gym-
nastics coach Donna DeMarino
Sanft said.

“Peoplejust shake their heads and
say, ‘Oh well, that’s Lisa,’ but she’s
business," Sanft said. “She comes in
the gym looking a little crazy with
her shark hat on, but once she gets
started, she’s totally business — and
there’s no doubting that.”

Shirk said, “I don‘t mind people
laughing at me. If there’s something
I want to do, as long as it doesn’t

Shirk regaining
Al 1- America form

hurt any one, I don’t care how crazy
it is -— I‘ll do it. If it makes someone
laugh or smile, it’s worth it.”
Teammate Jackie Calderone said
that Shirk is a real lift to the team
and gives everyone inspiration.
“You watch her go up there and
do her routine; she has so much con-
centration and tries so hard to stay

_ up. When you go up there, it gets

you psyched up,” she said. “Ifyou’re

in a bad mood or bummmed out, A

and Lisa starts doing stuff, there’s no
way you can stay in that mood for
long. She’s great.”

Her teammates are usually at a
loss for words to describe her per-
sonality, but Shirk brought up an
example she thought was a true pic-
ture of what she’s really like.

She said that she was planning to
go shopping once this summer, she
saw a man sitting up in a tall tree.
The tree was overlooking a river and
was equipped with a homemade
rope swing. She went shopping and
quickly bought a bathing suit specif-
ically so she could go back and try
the swing.

Karen Martin, Shirk’s roommate
and fellow gymnast said, “That’sjust
her. I like to congratulate everyone;
it keeps my mind off of everything

Mark Klafter

R‘0n’.Litz/ The Pitt

Klafter prosperirig

By Bob Green
The Pitt News '

Before coming to Pitt, sopho-
more Mark Klafter knew he had
the tools to become a top-flight
gymnast. Now, he is using those
tools to carve out a promising
collegiate career.

As a freshman, he set a school
record in the all—around competi-
tion with an overall score of
54.45.

“Mark works hard, is ﬂexible
and is very powerful," said Pitt
head coach Frank D’Amico.
“Mark has a lot of potential that
is yet to be brought out.”

Klafter, a_ graduate of Smith-
town (N.Y.) High School, has —
been practicing gymnastics since

elementary school. A series of
knee injuries hampered his early
career, but by the end of’hisjun—
ior year in high school, he
decided to set his mind solely on
gymnastics. As a senior, he won
the State Championship in the
all-around competition. _

After his record setting year in
I983, Klafter competed in this
summer's Empire State Games,
an open competition to deter-
mine New York’s amateur cham-
pion. There he won the floor
exercise, an event in which he has
been steadily improving, with a,
9.8.

Klafter and his teammates
have only competed in one meet
this season, the Shenandoah
Invitational at James Madison
University this past weekend. He
won the parallel bars (93), rings

(9.4) and_ floor exercise (9.65),
which only backs up his claim
that he has improved since last
year.

“Frank [D‘Amico] has helped
me a lot with my technique. As a
result, l’ve improved immen-
sely," Klafter said. “Every time I
practice, I try to get the most of
my workout. Improvements
have taken place in my perfor-
mance due to this hard work."

In addition to Klafter, there
are three other members of the
team that compete in the all3
around: Dave Smith, Matt
Peters and Frank Kratz. Kratz
also won the Shenandoah all-
around title. He believes that the
added competition in practice
has helped each of the
performers.

not crazy. Plus [the clothes] keep her
warm.“ '

“At the rate she’s going now, she
will definitely be an All—America,”
Martin said. “She has a good shot at
going in and placing in the the top
three again in the nationals. Fresh-
man year, she came in second. When
she hits, no one can touch her.”

Shirk is an honor student as well
as a top-notch gymnast and is con-
sidering graduate school after this

year. Shirk is eligible for another
year of competion and isicurrentiy
undecided about her future. She did
say, however, she isn’t interested in
coaching unless she works with an
elite outfit or younger kidsjust start-
ing their gymnastics careers.

Before Shirk's ankle injury in
I982, she was consided for the
Olympic Trials but was unable to
follow through. Shirk says it doesn’t
bother her, and the Olympics were
never an ultimate goal.

She added that she would like to

When competitors talk about Lisa
Shirk, they comment on her confi-
dence and her smoothness. And
some, like Slippery Rock’s head
coach Linda Spadine, also say with
little regret that the best part about
Shirk is that she‘s a senior.

INSIGHTS

INTO    
STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Paid Advertisement

Who are the new Student
Government Board mem-
bers? What are their goals?
What are they going to do for
me?

If you find yourself asking
these questions—and not
getting answers—-—read on
and meet your new Student
Government Board.

Ken Stram

Student Government
Board President Ken Stram
is majoring in Political
Science and German. He is a
member of the Theta Chi
Fraternity and enjoys jogging
and reading novels. His
future intentions include
spending a year in Germany
after graduation and then
attending law school. His
past activities include serving
on the Student Government
Board, the Hand-in-Hand
Festival and tutoring for the
Math Center.

Ken has returned to the
Board this year because he
feels that his past accomp-
lishments as a Board member
were good and he hopes to
contribute more as Presi-
dent. He believes that serving
on the Board was a continu-
ous learning experience for
him and that this year it will
progress.

Ken expects more student
participation and more inter-
action with student needs.
One of his major goals is to
create better student rela-
tions and to make sure that

I the studnets realize that he

and the Board are there for
the benefit of the students.
He and the other Board
members plan to approach
the students directly and ask
them for suggestions for
improvements. Another one
of Ken's efforts will be to rein-
state full-time status in the
Internship Office and “make
sure it sticks”. He hopes that

ings will be carried‘bn and
developed.

Ken couldn’t be happier
with the way the present

— Board is functioning together

and he feels that they are very
enthusiastic about the issues
that they are now facing and
those they will face in the
near future.

John Geyer

John Geyer is an English
writing major and plans to
attend law school after gra-
duation. He is an active
member of Delta Tau Delta
fraternity and is interested in
the transfer of fraternities to
their new location on the hill,
especially in the transporta-
tion problems that might
arise. He is currently working
with Pamela Hart to increase
campus bus service. Because
of the increase of student
population on the hill, they
will propose two buses run-
ning every fifteen minutes
instead of the single bus that
runs every half hour.

Aside from busing, com-
muter parking is his main
interest. John was a commu-
ter and realizes the frustra-
tions students face because
of the lack of parking spaces,
especially on street cleaning
days. He is in contact with the
Pittsburgh Police about cut-
ting down street cleaning
hours and hopes to do what
he can about commuter
parking problems.

Betsy Fitzpatrick

Betsy Fitzpatrick is a junior

majoring in Business and
English Writing. She ran for
Student Government Board
because she has "a definite
interest in student life at Pitt.

Betsy hopes to restore the

Internship Office to full-time
status and wants to be sure
t , that the Book Center oper-

ates in beneﬁt of the students
in all facets. She would like to
focus on more student input
and generate interest in Stu-
dent Government.

Betsy has been appointed
as the Board's business man-
ager and has begun to work
on the budget.

She is currently investigat-
ing the Book Center and
hopes to accomplish late-
night studying in ‘certain
buildings during exams.

She is optimistic about her

along with altering time sche-
dules and routes. Addition-
ally,
recommends more students
to run for SGB: “the oppor-
tunities to become involved
are countless, but not
enough students take advan-
tage of them.”

Bob has been invloved in
student government since
high school and wanted to
continue pursuing it here at
Pitt. When asked why he ran
for the position he remarked,
“I felt I had some good ideas
and that I could use them to

Pamela Hart

Pamela Hart is currently a
sophomore serving on the
Student Government Board.
She is a English Writing-
/ Communications major and
plans to pursue a position in
television reporting. Pamela
decided to run for SGB
because she wanted,to be
more involved. After pre-
viously serving on the Stu-
dent Relations Committee,
she resolved to apply her
efforts more effectively and
opportunity knocked-—
“opportunity was there and I
took the chance.” As a
whole, Pamela sees Student
Government as an “out-of-
class education.” Learning
leadership, working closely
together and obtaining a tre-
mendous scope on the Uni-
versity are all important
aspects she holds for the
Board.

has already accomplished a
great deal even though he's
been on the Board for two
weeks. ,
Bob would like to continue
working on keeping the
Internship Office open full

more student input into stu-
dent government and is striv-
ing to see that this goal is
achieved. He is also working

His activities at Pitt include
the Resident Student Associ-
ation, where he served as a
floor representative, an exec-
utive board representative
and executive board treas-
urer. Because of his involve-
ment with RSA and his past
experience with the network
of the administration, David"
feels he can contribute sub-'
stantially to this year's board.
David enjoys committee
involvement and is anxious to
work with other board
members in completing their
goals. Projects include a com-
plete review of the basketball
ticket policy, a search and
establishment for late night
hour study places after Hil-
lman library has closed, and a
continuing effort to reinstate
the internship ofﬁce to full-
time status. David is also
looking into ways to build
unity among commuters.
While working at his uni-
que» part-time job, David has,
to say the least, “met all kinds
of people.” David drives a cab
three nights a week. Interest-
ingly, just after being elected
to SGB, he had a call for
someone in Schenley Quad,
who, to his suprise, was the
new Provost, Dr. Bejamin.
David is open and willing to
respond to student sugges-
tions and hopes to see -an
increase in campus aware-
ness and involvement with
Student Government.

Jim Haug

Jim Haug, a sophomre pol-
itical science/economics
major from Lafayette, Indi-
ana, ran for the Board
because he felt he had talents
to offer Pitt students. aug
says he “likes to get t ings
done” and is willing to donate
his energy, time, and willing-
ness to work for the SGB
effort.

Presently, Haug is serving
on the Student Assembly
committee with chairman,
Jeff Mallinger.‘He “is in the
process of setting up the first
meeting and hopes to have
‘Student Assembly in full
operation by the end of the
term. it is hoped that the Stu-
dent Assembly, comprised of
presidents of major campus
organizations, will serve as an
advisory board to SGB and
allow more student voices to
be heard. Haug is also study-
ing the basketball ticket disri-
bution problem and is
concerned with the operation
of the Internship Office. He

expects the Board to solve .

many of these problems this
term with what he calls “nine
hard-working people.” As for
himself, Haug was suprised
to discover many things he
didn’t know about Pitt and
hopes he will continue to
learn about the operations of

    
 
 
   
    
  
   
   
  
   

the university. He also
expects his SGB experience
to teah. him how to work
cooperatively with other
people.

Avery Abrams

Board member Avery
brams is a sophomore

became interested in Student
Government through his
work as treasurer on the
Governmental Relations
Committee.

Avery plans on fighting
hard or the student body. He‘
pla' s on talking to the Direc-
tor of Student Housing to try
and change the “very conser-
vative” check-in policy.
Avery realizes that the
bureaucracy may slow down
his plans for cable television
in the dorms, but he would’
like ‘to lay the ground work
and get the ball rolling.

He plans on being “more
responsive to students and
try to help them with their
grievances.”

According to Abrams, “the
Student Government Board
is very committed to improv-
ing the quality of life for all Pitt
sutdents.”

Jeff Mallinger

Student Government
Board member Jeff Mallinger
is a senior majoring in Eco-
nomics and Political Science.
One of the reasons Jeff ran
for board was to follow up on
some of the projects that pre-
vious boards started such as
the Internship Office and the
Student Assembly Board.
The primary reason Jeff ran
is to get manditory teaching
evaluations for all teachers
and to publish the results of
those results. Jeff believes
the students should know
how much education they are

getting for their tuition
dollars.
Jeff is very pleased with his

recent appointment as chair-
man of the Student Assembly
Board. He plans to rigidly
enforce the manditory meet-
ing requirements--“every
organization gets to air their
grievances, so it is to their
benefit to attend.” Those
organizations not attending
at least one meeting of the
assembly per term could
have all of their assets frozen.
Jeff expects a very produc-
tive year. According to Mal-
linger, the previous board
“has set a good foundation
for the credibility of the Stu-
dent Government Board.”
He feels that a major advan-
tage for this board was that
only ten people ran. There
was no mudslinging involved
in any of the campaigns. They
ran as friends and won as
friends—“the members of
this board are going to be
supportive of each other.”
Whether or not this board
will be successful is yet to be
seen, but cooperation
between them is a major
component in the effective-
ness of the boardlas a whole.

Successful Charity
. Drive
—Pat Guardino

On December 18, 1983.
several members of the Stu-

_ dent Relations committee
stood in the bitter cold at

KDKA-TV for over an hour.
Why would we do such a
crazy thing in subzero
temperatures? We didn’t do
it because we wanted to be
on TV with Al Julius or John
Cigna. We did it to say thanks
to all of the students and staff
at Pitt who helped us raise
$370.00 for our Second
Annual Childrens Hospital
Charity Drive.

To collect the money we
sold red and green paper
links which formed a giant
chain that hung in the admit-
tance lobby of the Hospital.
Each link had a personal holi-
day or get-well message writ-
ten on it.

We would like to extend a
special thanks to those who
donated and to all who put in
their time manning tables in
the Student Union and in the
Towers Lobby.’ We raised
$100.00 more than last year,
and next year we hope to do
even better.

reviewed proposals and
made recommendations to
the board. The board then
accepted or rejected alloca-
tions recommendations
according to allocation

On Saturday, many pro-
grams were set up for the
board. These programs

’ ranged from “sparking moti-

vation” to‘ familiarizing them-
selves with Robert’s Rules of
Order, the book used as the
format of their weekly
meetings.

Overall the retreat was
very informative and fun. The

mittee members got to know
one another”. It also gave the

board a chance to set some
goals for this year. According
to Betsy Fitzpatrick, “It was a
fun and very rewarding
experience.”

“With three other all-
arounders on the team, we push
each other to be better," Klafter
said.

The New York native has set
the goal of competing in the all-
around at Nationals at the end of
the season.

“I like to set short-term goals
and complete them,” he said.

“Mark is really competitive,”
Kratz said. “If he wants to do

something, he will do it." 2’

CORRECTION: In the
Monday edition of The Pitt
News the wrong headlines
appeared above the two gym-
nastics stories. The men’s
gymnastics story by Bob
Green had a headline which
read ‘Lack of depth...’when it
should have read ‘Panthers
win opener’ and vice versa.
