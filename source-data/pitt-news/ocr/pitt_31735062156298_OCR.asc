New Parking Lot Kills»

' 0 e . " r .
Union Chances F here
,‘ ' By, JOHN DE NINNO ' 1 -
'  lotion which the p'ro‘posed’Stude,nt- Union could have
been built is now “being leveled for a "parking lot. 1

Oaklan_d’s parking problem will be somewhat relieved

when‘ the new William Penn Parking Lot, opposite the

Mosqﬂe, is opened to handlean ad-¢ . x

ditional 350 cars.

However the parking area may
prove to -be mixed blessing since it
may put a damper on the planned
Student Union. There had been
some speculation, since Chancellor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald announced the
Union would not be built on the
Cathedral campus, that the build-
ing might go up across the street..
The most logical place seemedto
be the vacant lot. ‘

Hopes Raised

Hopes for the .-“much needed”
Union were raised about four
weeks agoswhen Theodore W. Bid-
dle, dean of men, announced that
the government had lifted restric-
tions on . building material for
places of amusement, under which
the Union came. At that time he
remarked that it would be built

» “as close to the university popula-

tion as possible. Probably between
Heinz Chapel and_,the Cathedrallf
But Dr. Fitzgerald disagreed on

the grounds that the Cathedral

campus was “overcrowded.” He
said Pitt needed an expanded cam-
pus. ’
Since any expansion of the_cam-
pus, including the Union, would
logically include property close to
the present campus the property.
across from the Cathedral, on the
Fifth Ave. side, is considered by
many as the best choice. ' ‘

Shriners Moving Out

The Shriners in the Syria’
Mosque have hinted for some time
that they would like to move to
larger quarters and,Pitt was con-
sidered as a prospective buyer of
the Mosque’s property.

However, J. Leonard Cook, man7

“Vifhen a speaker at a banquet

questions start.” .

Upto the present time, John
Marshall Society has always been
an honorary organization for pre-

law‘students_who had earned 45
credits and maintained a 2.00
quality point average. '
_ Change Suggested

This year, Brainard Currie, for-
mer dean of the law school, sug-
‘gested that the membership re-

quirements be'~changed in order,

‘"’«that all pre—law students might

join. ‘One reason for the possible

. change is that John Marshall is

the only undergraduate pre-
_~lé‘g‘al organization. Another rea-
son is that everything John Mar-

" shall Society’s plans requires. the

support of the whole pre-law stu-

it dent body.

‘In a way only a future lawyer
could‘ devise,.Al Reuben states the
purpose of the club, “John Mar-
shall attempts to provide a forum
for discussion and research by
vpre.-legal students and to give as-
sistance and guidance to any and
in the Uni-
versity.” -‘ ’

Advance Preparation
“Too many students,” he ex-

_ . plains, “entering the law school on

‘ 5°

the 14th floor see the word ‘pre-
ceptor’ for the ﬁrst time in their
lives. Our job is to make sure
those students areprepared for
law school.” ‘

‘In sponsoring‘ the mock trials
held "earlier this year, John Mar-
shall- cooperated with the law
school’s Student Bar Association.

Lawyers to the End

A These mock trials had all the
seriousness -of real cases. “Except
once,” Al remembers, .“when the
murderer on trial for his life had
actually ‘been in a proceeding mock
trial—-as the defense attorney.”‘

Also on this year’s agenda are
plans to co-sponsor, withthe YM

whole class ‘of people in our "so-\

 

eiety who ‘come under the class-
iﬁcation of _ hate mongers, who
seem to get great satisfaction out
of casting discredit upon others.
There are glaring examples of
racial discrimination to‘ be found
in many areas of the nation. Re-
ligious, political, economic, so-
cial groups‘are continu"allyltak-l-
ing verbal and legal potshots at

. each other through inability to

ameliorate their prejudices to-
ward one another. And, in our
attitudes toward "other peoples
and nations of the world we
still have such things,..as the

’ nowly—enacted McCarran immi-

grationlaw, and other evidences

» of a discouraging amount of in-

tolerance.

But on the second glance
around-.you might also see": a‘

growing. body of FEPC laws de-\.

signed to reduce racial and relig-

~ipus discrimination among ‘em-
ployers; a vast_number of social

and politicalfgroups set up for
thesole purpose of helping the
underprivileged or handicapped

- in our society. Then, there are’

the philanthropic capitalists" who
have contributed millions of dol-
lars to projects that have helped
raisethe general level of life in
this country,‘ and contributed

greatly to the security ‘a'nd“hap-

piness’of its citizens. Many of

ive side of the ledger are unique

   

in history, at least quantitatively,

so _it may safely be assumed that
we are objectively making some
progress by way of making the
dream of brotherhdod a reality.
But at least as important is the
fact that anyone has that dream
at all. It is certainly, true that’
most of our thinking on ethics,

and morality, and_ much of our :

system of civil law, and many of
our social customs are founded"
on one idea: the Golden Rule.‘
Much of the inspiration’ for this‘
has come from the teachings of

Christ and Christian theo1og3r'.f'
There is another source as well, a ‘ G

and -a very fundamental one:
man’s social nature. Man can no

» more live by‘ himself, unrelated
_to other humans, than cana jun-
‘gle plant ,transplanted to -the '
desert. Many of his social needs » 
are, phsycici or spiritual tones, -' -

true enough, but« irnportant
nonetheless. ‘ 7

What is the conclusion to be.”

drawn from all this? Is brother-

-hood a dream? A becomihgre-,‘

ability? It is both, of course, be-.

cause brotherhood is to us a« it

necessity. We have been cast by
God’ or destiny, whichever? you"
prefer, to live with and for one
another. Therefore, we strive for,
brptherhood because we are
made for brotherhood, and we

come more to realizing our true ,

selves -as ‘we achieve it.

On Saturday

‘After dropping their last
meets, Coach ' Ben
Grady’s swimmers hope to break
into the win column . Saturday
when they visit Navy at Annap-
olis. ' . V
Last year the Panthers and the
Midshipmen battled ‘to a 42-42 tie
in the third meet of the season.
With three losses to date, indi-
cations are that the Panthers will
have a hard time defending their
Eastern Collegiate championship.
Saturday’s 45-39 loss to Syracuse
came in the ﬁnal event when the
Orange free style relay team
touched home ﬁrst in a— close race.
However, Breaststroker Ronnie
Gainsford continued his record-
setting pace by winning his event
in 2:24.4, a new Syracuse pool
mark.
Other winners were Jerry Weiss
in the 220 and 440 free styles, Tom
. Blosser in the diving, Freddie

O’Nions in theindividual medley,
and Bill Corr in the 50-yard free

The loss of Captain Don Fan-
ning, though, has hurt the Blue-

Grady has been hard-pressed to
ﬁind a consistent point—maker in
the backstroke event.

“Lock Haven will be tough,”
drawled Peery, “they have some

But, without a doubt, Penn State
is the match which may determine
the national ranking of the Panth-
ers. Peery ranks his squad among

Oklahoma A & M, and Penn State
ranking as the top three.

‘ “Penn State's rank is something

“but it doesn’t mean we are just

You can’t sell our boys short and
J;hey’ve proved their worth so far.

Meanwhile, Peery has lost the

an injured knee in the Army meet.
Bill Kozy, his replacement, has
satisﬁed Peery as a ﬁll-in winning

Matthews, who complied a 2-2 rec-
ord this season, will be lost for the

Mister America of Pitt is a slightly. built guy Whose-

Egypt and Sweden. He also exchanged grapevine leg holds

But more important than
the-prestige our Mister Amer-
ica has gained for himself is
the admiration that others
have found for athletesof his .
type. Mister .-America is
Hugh Peery, a_ professional
student in the School of 'D’en- _

record here has topped that. of any wrestler -in‘ Pitt history.

'In ‘two years Peery has ._decisioned‘ ten opponents and -pinned
seven others. He haslost only one ‘match. But it’s the combination
of brain and brawn that entitles‘ Peery to the Mr. America ‘label.

The loss gave Newman Club a

The Newmans trotted’ on the

Non Nomens Held

Pointless in Finish

Phys Ed Club "took ‘over ﬁrst
place in, the Club League Monday
night in the Field House by whip-
ping Non Nomens, 43-28, in what
was probably the strangest ﬁnish
to an intramural game this season.

With a 7-1 record the Phys Eds
now movea half game in front of
Varsity Hall (6-1).

After four periods of regulation
play, both squads counted 28
points. Then, Non Nomens col-
lapsed in the overtime while their
opposition exploded for 15 points.
The ﬁnal score was 43-28 with the
Non Nomens pointless in the over-
time.

.The reverse... form of the Non
Nomens was evenrmore signiﬁcant
since the losers held a 7-6 lead’ at
the quarter and a ﬁve—point bulge
at halftime. Never during the reg-
ulation tirne was one- team de-
prived a ﬁeld goal for more than
‘one minute. 1 4 ’ ’
~ In the second half Bill Schmidt
lead the’Phys Eds with brilliant
board play and reduced the Non

The action set the scene for the

turned out only to be the anti-
