Volume LXXXIX, Issue 96 I Thursday, March 29 1995

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

Last Thursday’s issue of The
Pitt News, the independent
student newspaper at the
University of Pittsburgh, con-
tained blank spaces in place of
two photos.

The photos deemed porno-
graphic by John Major, presi-
dent of Typecraft Press Inc.,
were to appear with a review
of _ the Johnathan Blank docu-
mentary “Sex, Drugs and
Democracy.”

A representative from
Typecraft Press Inc. phoned

RSA

petitions
Marriott
Money 

By Sandra Bennett
For The Pitt News

Members of the Resident
Student Association plan to
circulate a petition protesting

.a memo students recently

received detailing changes in
next year’s meal plan.

The memo was sent to all
upperclass students who will
live on campus next year. It
said students will have the
option of buying three, five
or seven meals per week.
Any meals not used during
the week be lost. Additional
meals can be purchased with

Marriott Money, which stu- _

dents can use all semester.
Marriott Money works like
real money, but can only be
used at Marriott campus
facilities.

“The petition says the meal
plan as proposed is unaccept-
able to students,” said Chris
Kasper, an RSA member.

Betsy Sallade-Farina,
director of Food Services,
said she disagreed.

“We’ve taken all the com-
plaints and tried to work
around them,” she said. “All
the problems we experienced

this year have been
addressed in the new meal
plan.”

Sallade-Farina said the
plan gives students discre-
tionary funds to make food
purchases, which the current
block plan does not provide.
Students have complained

“I got onithe phone and they
said that they were not going
to print the paper with those
pictures in there. I then pro-
ceeded to explain to them
what the pictures were for and
what they were about,” said
Serlin. “And he didn’t really
seem interested.”

Serlin said he was "then
given three options from the
printer: either pull the pic-
tures, let the printer alter the
pictures so they met their stan-
dards or not print the paper at
all. _

' “I chose to have them pull
the pictures totally because I

did not feel comfortable
allowing them to alter the pic-
tures in any way,” said Serlin.

According to Major, he did
not want his South Side-based
company associated with the
pictures. “We have a reputa-
tion‘ to uphold in the commu-
nity and it was our decision
not to print the pictures.”

In a letter sent this Tuesday
to Christine Hanna, editor in
chief of The Pitt News, Major
outlined Typecraft’s policy on
“pornography.” The letter
states the printer’s objections
to reproducing “graphic sexual
photographs depicting any
type of sex act  and vivid
nudity for shock purposes.”

PAT  
buses
provide
shuttles

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

Beginning May 1, stu-
dents, faculty and staff at the
University of Pittsburgh will
be riding Port Authority

. buses between the campus,
Squirrel Hill and Shadyside,
instead of the regular shut-
tles provided by Lenzner
Coach Line.

After failing in October to
renew the permits for the
Sewickly-based company to
continue serving those areas,
PAT has decided to provide
the service on their own,
allowing students, faculty
and staff to ride free to the
two neighborhoods.

“[PAT] will be able to
obviously pick up students
at current stops and maybe
add some additional stops,” ‘

.s'aid-the Vice Chancellor for
Student and Public Affairs
Leon Haley.

Haley also said there was
a possibility of the Port
Authority extending the line
into Shadyside further east,
enabling more people to
take the bus. Ridership may

1 even increase the number of
buses for students, faculty.
and staff. A lot of that’s
going to be evaluated over
the summer months,” Haley
said.

Haley said the yearlong
experiment would start at
the beginning of the sum-
mer term. -

Transportation Bob Harkins

O'Connor elected vice chair of forum

By Stephen Westrick
For The Pitt News

Pitt Chancellor J, Dennis
O’Connor will be a prominent
force in leading a group of 80
academic and corporate chief
executives in their attempt to

improve the skills of the-

American workforce.

Chancellor O’Connor has
recently been elected the ﬁrst-
ever vice chair of the Business-
l-Iigher Education Forum.

The Forum, which is made up
of 40 corporate leaders and 40
university leaders, was formed

by the American Council on
Education in 1978. The purpose
of the forum is to identify, review
and act on issues of mutual con-
cern to both the corporate and
university communities.

O’Connor has ‘been an active
member of the Forum for the
past four years.

“As a member of the Business-
Higher Education Forum for
the past few years, I have found
this organization an invaluable
source of creative and invigorat-
ing discussion, characterized
by openness of thought
from diverse perspectives,” he

said. .

In selecting issues for debate
and action the Forum has
focused on the areas of
American competitiveness,
human resource development,
school reform, international rela-
tions and the environment.

The Forum holds two semian-
nual meetings in Washington in
order to develop strategies and

make suggestions for the issues '

being debated. This year the
main concern of the Forum will
be in enhancing the skills of
America’s workforce at all lev-

_Pitt ski club travels near and

far for mountain excitement

By Stephen Westrick
For The Pitt News

At the end of a long
week, one option is to
hang around Oakland —
but another is to take a trip
to the slopes. _

This is exactly what over
400 students do every
week.

Every Friday afternoon
members of the university
ski club load onto two or
three chartered buses
which transport them from
Pitt to the ski slopes of
Seven Springs.

The weekly trips to
Seven Springs by the
club gives many students
the opportunity to hit
the slopes for the first
time.

“Seven Springs trips
attract multicultural stu-
dents that have never
before seen snow,” said
Rick Fusting, the club’s

business manager.

These weekly trips also
provide students with rea-
sonable rates on lift tickets
and rental equipment for
those needing to rent skis
or boots.

It is not only skiers who

have the opportuni-ty to

enjoy the slopes and low
rates offered by the club.
Seven Springs also offers a
wide variety of activities
for those students who pre-
fer to fly down the moun-
tain on a snowboard.

“Seven Springs really
offers a great many options
to those students. that
snowboard,” Fusting said.

These options include a
snowboarding park, a half-
pipe, rail slides and a vari-
ety ofjumps.

In addition to offering
affordable rates on weekly
trips to Seven Springs, the
club also offers students
the opportunity to ski out

west.

The club most recently
took a trip to Jackson
hole, Wyo. The trip, which
took place over Christmas
break this year, gave
members of the ski club
the chance to break away
from the slopes around the
area and adventure out
west.

“Skiing in the East is
nothing like skiing out
west. The West is definite-
ly more exciting,” said
Kara Jarabak, a first-year
Pitt student who went on
the Wyoming trip.

The club will be going
out west again over spring
break, travelling to
Steamboat, Colo.

The club which boasts

over 400 members is one

of the largest active clubs
on campus. The club is run
by President Joe Peleckis
and Business Manager
Rick Fusting.

guidelines set by anyone out-

away the ability to function as
an independently run student
newspaper.

.“It would effectively take
power away from the student
editors and the student editor
in chief and place it in other
people’s hands,” Serlin said,
“which we feel is not appro-
priate.”

The media advisor to The
Pitt News, Jim Tynen, said in
yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette that the removal of
the photos could make the
editors think twice about pur-
suing certain stories in the
future. .

“Is the editor going to think,
‘Well, should I run this article

on gay rights? Run an article '

on sex on campus?” asked
Tynen. “No editor can proper-
ly edit if she is goingto be
wondering, ‘Well, is the print-
er going to pull this at 6 a.m.,
when I have no practical way
to respond?”’

According to Staci Vemick, a

Vemick added, “We haven’t set-

“If it’s necessary, we’ll tweak

that the block plan is unfair
because they do not receive
change from their purchases,
and it has provided more
meals than they can eat.

Many students said they
are worried that the new plan
goes overboard in attempting
to correct problems with the
block plan.

“I think it limits students
far too much with the number
of meals they can eat  [the
plan does not provide]
enough to eat two meals a
day and still get through the
entire semester,” said Andy
Miller, RSA president.

Sallade-Farina said studies
show the average student
only eats five to seven meals
per week with their ‘meal
plan, regardless of the plan
they choose. However, for
students who want a bigger
meal plan, Food Services
will offer meal plans that
offer up to 15 meals per
week.

“The students should also

see‘ there will be a "change in
pricing policy,” Sallade-
Farina said.

She said the block plan was
inefficient and caused inﬂat-
ed prices. The new plan will
allow a reduction in some
prices, and students on the
meal plan will receive a dis-
count in the cafeterias.

However, some students
said they think they will still
end up spending more money
for food next year, because
they will exhaust their meal

plan and have to pay cash for .

food.

“If it’s not beneficial to us,
why should we agree to it?”
Kasper said. “If I get the
majority of students to sign
the petition. they’re going to
have to do something to
change it.”

Miller said he doesn’t think
Food Services spent enough
time talking to people who
buy meal plans. He said he
would like a student advisory

board to be set up to get p

more input from students.

blank space in a review of the film Sex, Drugs, and Democracy.
As many Pitt students now know, this was formerly occupied by
a picture which the printer later removed. A second picture and
its caption were removed from the front page of the section as
well. I _

These pictures were not put in for shock value, not was their
inclusion a snap decision made without due consideration.
Before the decision was made to run the pictures, the writer of
the story, the editor of the section, the managing editor and edi-
tor in chief of The Pitt News all met and discussed the pictures.

The pictures were inseparably linked to the text of the (article,
about a film concerning censorship related in sexually explicit
material in Holland. The article itself was about a film, which is
a visual medium, and in order to bridge the gap between the text
and the visual images of the film, the photographs were placed
along side the article. This was in order to give readers as much
information as possible without actually seeing thefilm.

This newspaper is designed to be the voice of the students at
the University of Pittsburgh. It has, as its mission, the duty to
cover issues which are of importance to the students. In order to
discuss issues openly and honestly, the evidence has to be put
out for all to see. Whether this takes the form of what some
might consider graphic description in text, or a graphic photo,
nonetheless the students must be allowed to examine things for
themselves and make up their own minds.

The university, as an institution is committed to free inquiry
and attempts to foster that in its students. Not allowing the stu-
dents to have a way to gain news and express views without
censorship runs counter to this ideal. The Pitt News, which is
financially independent of the University of Pittsburgh, attempts
to serve as this organ for the students. Being financially inde-
pendent allows us to take a critical look not only at things which
involve students, but also issues involving the faculty and
administration. To do so, The Pitt News must be free of censor-
ship in all its forms. A

Censorship is a form of intolerance, and to allow it to continue
unchallenged will only lead‘ to increased intolerance in the
future. The freedom of speech and the press should be held invi-
olable. While printers have the right to determine what kind of.
business they want to take on, they shouldlnot take a contract
and use that power to force their standards on others. Printers
should not usurp editorial power by determining content ‘after
the paper has been put together. Printers are not legally liable or
accountable for any of the content of this paper. We as the
Editorial Board assume full responsibility for the content.

In order to truly be a voice for the University of Pittsburgh
and its students, the content of The Pitt News must be left to the
discretion of ‘student editors. Its primary responsibility must be

to those same students. If this is not the case, then it is just a

mouthpiece for someoneelse with a veneer of student control.

It's cr bad year to be 0 risqué photo

it. I write for a student newspaper, your stu-
dent newspaper, and as such I am supposed
to work for an independent voice within our
Pitt community. What has happened is nothing
short of ironic, inane and absurd. As I expected,
my review for Jonathan Blank’s film Sex,

Ishouldn’t even have to write this, goddamn

Drugs and Democracy raised a powder-keg of .

free speech issues. And Blank has hit a Puritan
nerve.

Because The Pitt News has beencensored,
you have been censored. And whetheriyou want
to do something about it is, your choice. Even if
you decide not to make a choice, you s_till have
made a choice. But by now, this column is‘ noth-

ing if -not a reaction. The Pittsburgh Post-I

Gazettte,'KDKA News and the Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review have all done significant pieces
on our story. Our story. The AP even picked up

- the story on wire.

In case you missed it, which you have if The
Pitt News is all you’ve read for the last week,-
those enormous blank spaces on page one and
three of last Thursday’s “Vox” are not our corny
idea of a joke. Four photos from the movie Sex,
Drugs and Democracy were put on those pages
after our editors gave their approval based on
the non-sensational and critical aspect of the
review — and the need to be frankand honest
when examining the issue of sexuality.

Thursday morning, I was floored to see that
two of the four photos had been pulled. I wrote
the story, I saw the film, I spoke with the film-
maker and I saw the photos. These photos were
not sexual. One was suggestive of sex. (perhaps
it was pulled because it may have been lesbian
sex, and not normal hetero-American sex '(?)).
The photos were not graphic, and they were per-

tinent to the issues raised in my article and ,

Blank’s film. His film is intended to show
America a better method of structuring our
democracy. American mythology claims that it’s
citizens are free, yet we come nowhere close to
Holland’s freedom. The intention behind Sex,
Drugs and Democracy was to show just how
much American citizens have been misled with
endless nattering of free speech and free expres-
sion. These ideals come with strings attached in
our society, and this Typecraft incident spot-
lights those strings.

Amidst a whirlwind of in-house controversy,
legal decisions and conversations with

Typecraft’s owners, it is understandable why’

some staffers used caution when deciding to
write today’s page one article. No decision with
this case, in either the businessrelations with
our printer or fulfilling our jobs as reporters, has
been easy to make. But, now a decision has
been made, and albeit reactionary (a story could
have run Monday), the real issue at hand can be
discussed and legitimized.

When The Pitt News decided to run those
photos, it was as a result of deliberation between
myself as the writer and the editors. As Sex,
Drugs and Democracy’s filmmaker Jonathan
Blank would agree, the majority of Dutch citi-
zens would not consider the body, acts of sexu-
ality or any other related topic dirty. And cer-
tainly not the subject of censorship. The fact
that Typecraft pulled our pictures only. shows
the extent to which we Americans have lost our
freedom of expression and press. If America
were truly the land of the free, then considera-
tions such as whether photos should run would
bcmoot.,  .  , _ _

So, fuck censorship. Fuck and fuck it. And I’ll
say it again, because we are not_the Post-

‘Gazette and I can. Fuck Censorship. The Pitt

News is a college newspaper, run for, by’ and of
college students, and in order to function as

I. such we cannot have the prospect of printer cen-
‘ sorship (or any other forms of censorship)

looming over our heads. That means anyone
who would try to influence The Pitt News
through any means other than the editorial
board, including the Student Publications
Board. ' _

The Pitt News is an institution financially
independent from the university. We are not The
University Times; our purpose does not include
promoting Pitt-the—institution. The Pitt News
does not function to bring more students to the
university and thereby fill the university’s "cof-

~ fers. Any group that tries to promote the campus

community cannot examine it with objectivity.

the_ maze of empty beer cans
and pizza boxes to reach

just might see a rare Pitt
victory in a tournament in
which they have only won a
single game in the past four
seasons.

Yes, I am talking about
the same Pitt team which
lost Tuesday night to
Miami, the former doormat
of the Big East, by blowing
a five-point lead with a little
over a minute left. And yes,
I know this is a squad which
has lost at least 10 games by
less than five points. And
yes, I realize this is a team
with limited resources in
talent, size, etc., but my gut
feeling holds true for sever-
al reasons.

First and foremost, the
Panthers will be fresh off a
five-day rest. Because of
their lack of depth, nobody
can deny the role of fatigue
in Pitt’s losses, After their
only substantial break dur-
ing their regular season, the
Panthers came roaring back
to handily beat Boston
College. Willard said he
could see the difference the
rest made, and he will see it
again in the tourney. _

Pittboseball looks for repeat withoutmciior cogs

By Ed‘ Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

Another baseball season

‘is set to dawn for head

coach Mark Jackson’s Pitt
baseball team, as the
Panthers will be traveling
to Florida over spring break
to open the 1995
campaign.

“We are
ready to play,”
Jackson said.
“We worked
hard in the fall
V i -and in the
weight room. The kids are
anxious and enthusiastic
about starting the season.”

Pitt will be looking for
some leadership, as the

"Panthers lost a fewgkey

members from last year’s
team.
“I think everybody has to

provide leadership individ- i

ually,” Jackson said. “If
everybody takes it one pitch
at a time, we will be all
right as far as leadership.”
The Panthers will be
looking to some returning
players to produce big‘ sea-
sons at the plate. Seniors
John ,DeBernardis, Ken
Strish and Tyler Shantz pro-
vide the most experience on
this team. Juniors Bill Derr,
Bob Miller, Jeff
Montgomery and Kurt

Womelsdorf will also pro-
vide some quality playing
time.
Contiis the leading sopho-
morereturning to the~»line-
up.
“People will have to step
up,” Jackson said.‘“I think
we have a lot of guys who
can hit, and it is just a com-
bination of them all hitting
together. There are a num-
ber of guys who can step up
and take charge offensive-'
ly.”

Miller is the leading
returning hitter forthe
Panthers. He hit .316 with
'25 runs batted in, in 38
games for Pitt last year.
Conti also hit .316 in 36
games, and Strish batted
.308 and had 18 RBI.

In the pitching depart-
ment Jackson feels he may
have one of the best staffs
in the Big East.

“The pitching staff is the
best we’ve had in terms of
overall talent, depth, right-
ies and lefties,” Jackson
said. “I think some of the
other teams in the Big East
will be surprised at the
quality of pitching that we
exhibit.”

Some of the hurlers that
Pitt will be counting on
include seniors Tedde
Campbell, Gregg Mrochko,
along with juniors Matt

It has been 19' hard fought

“It’s been a big drought,”

Stottlemyer said.

Panthers’ loss to the Lions

The 21st-ranked Panthers
were in control all the way,
winning seven out of ten

After dropping the next
match, J.J. Fasnacht came
through for the Panthers
again in the 142-pound
class. Brett Gould extended
the lead to l2-3 with a win
in the 150-pound match.

Penn State got a little
closerby winning the 158-

Panthers did not falter, win-

ning the next three matches.
Bryan Matusic won the 167-
pound match, John Gibeaut
won the l77—pound match
and Mark Bodo won the
190-pound match, bringing
the score to 21-7 and effec-
tively putting the meet out
of Penn State’s little paws.
The meet ended with a Penn
State victory in the heavy-
weight class to close out the

scoring 21-11.

This victory capped a very
successful season for the
Panther wrestling team.
They finished the season
with a 14-9 record, 3-3 in
the Eastern Wrestling
League. The season’s 14
wins is a single-season
record for the Panthers.

Somewhere in what one critic
called, “the backwash of the French
New Wave,” Eric Rohmer struggled to
craft films while his younger colleagues
Godard, Truffaut and Chabrol shook up
the cinematic world —— gaining interna-
tional fame and the film financing that
goes with it. Along with the young lions
of the New Wave in the ‘50s and ‘60s,
Rohmer’s filmic workstgrew from his
initial efforts as a film critic at Andre
Bazin’s journal Cahiers Du Cinéma.

But unlike his more famous contem-
poraries’, Rohmer’s films, starting with
his first feature (1959’s The Sign of
Leo), didn’t scream at audiences that
the author was there to revolutionize
film /as it was then known. Perhaps
being a good 10 years their senior and
Rohmer’s own beginnings not being in
film, but as a novelist, kept his subcon-
scious pool of inspiration more literary
than filmic. Both his mind and work
appear unconcerned with the politics of
redefining modernity and the moving
image that obsessed Godard, et al.

Whatever the reason, The Sign of
Leo met little recognition, and Rohmer
went back to work on Cahiers and
made his next two films as low-budget,
16mm, black and white shorts. Both of
these films, The Baker of Monceau
(1962) and S-uzanne’s Profession,
began Rohmer’s quest to film a series
of Contes Moraux or Moral Tales.

Rohmer’s idea of “moral” is a little dif-

-ferentthan. what you might expect.

Rohmer seems his him-
self as a moraliste’—
someone who “is inter-
ested in what goes on
inside man.” For him it’s
not that the film has a
moral to it but rather that
the film’s characters are
people who “try to ana-
lyze; they are not people
who act without thinking
about what they are
doing. What matters is
what they think about
their behavior, rather
than their behavior
itself.”

Perhaps it’s the subtle complexity of
examining characters in this way with a
medium as dramatic and dependent on
immediate visual impact as film is that
leaves Fiohmer’s films without the kind
of heavy-handed political and visual
forcefulness required to gain mass,
and even critical, audience attention. It
does seem revealing that his first real
international success, My Night at
Maud’s (1969), was the one early
Fiohmer film in which even he admits
that the characters “act according to
moral ideas that are fairly clearly
worked out.”

But there is a unique naturalism to
the ambiguities in the lives of Rohmer’s
characters. The politics are intensely
personalized and therefore not easy.
Rohmer’s work is based on a kind of

Al sa. Rhe'- 1 987 ieatureill‘ friens and ifrr.

psychological realism focused on sub-
tleties of character and mood.

After 20 years of filmmaking in the
shadow of the New Wave, Rohmer has
come outinto the light of the last two
decades to be an art house force of his
own. But still Rohmer gets criticized for
being ‘‘light,’’ for focusing too intently on
the personal world of his characters
and not directly connecting that to
greater politicalconcerns or_manipu|at-
ing film form to expand the medium’s
possibilities. .

is a fine piece of drama. The film is
based on the “true story’ of two young
teenage girls, Pauline Parker and
Juliet Hulme, played by Melanie
Lynskey and Kate Winslet respective-
ly, who build a magical wall between
themselves and the repressive school
they attend. When their parents con-
clude that their friendship grows too
close, ie. with lesbian overtones, the
two are forced to separate. The sce-
nario proves to be unbearable for both,
leading to the climax and subsequent
murder of Pauline’s mother. Using the
ole-brick-in-the-sock slammed-to-the-
head technique, they put an end to

their troubles. Well, at least their non-

lrene Jacob in l-?ed- the final installment in Kieslowski's trilogy.

legal problems.

Jackson delves into the bag 0’ magi-
cal realism with kiddy gusto and lush
results. As the film winds toward con-
clusion, the tension builds with
Jackson’s hand-held camerawork and
a tenaciously long march of death
scene. Heavenly Creatures is definitely
worth a spring break peep.

As the final installation for Krzysztof
Kies|owski’s tricolour trilogy, Blue,
White and Fled, Fied is a semi-interest-
ing portrait of alienation, fate and
chance. Opening with a stunning
sequence that shows a telephone
pulse traveling through a cable that
spans the English Channel, the theme

of communication permeates the entire
film. Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as a
hermit who spends all his time listen-
ing to other people’s telephone conver-
sations with his rigged Ham radio.
Irene Jacobs plays a model caught in:
the middle of a love triangle that
places her in the undesirable positionl
of ex-lover and now third wheel. The
movie's final scene brings together the
characters from all three film in a mov-
ing and emotional moment.
Showtimes for Fied are 7:30 p. m- daily
and 3 pm Saturday and Sunday.
Heavenly Creatures runs 5:30 pm and

In a Tuesday night phone
interview with Todd Snider, he
confessed to me his desire‘ to
work with Willie Nelson some-

, day. Being from Texas, where

Willie is a state treasure, I liked
Snider instantly.

“Willie Nelson;-l think that
would be somebody that I’d
like to maybe smoke some pot
with and play the guitar with,”
said Snider. Along with sharing
a fondness for the occasional
toke, Snider. also posses
Willie's talent for spanning the
musical spectrum.- ‘

Snider represents all that’s
good in rock, blues, country
and folk as he slides back and
forth between genres with
every track. He can sing about
the cycle of child abuse and
growing up (“You Think You
Know Somebody” and “l

Spoke As A Child”) with such

intensity that my walkman
stops that annoying crackle

long-enough for me to hear the '

lyrics. And on the same disc
he gives one of the best
tongue-in-cheek looks at the
Seattle music scene to date,
(“Talkin’ Seattle Grunge Rock
Blues.”) That intensity is never
more obvious than at one of
his shows. Even while doing a
song like the aforementioned
Willie Nelson’s “Shot Gun
Wedding” at last month's
Rosebud show, people still got
up to dance. “We’d never done
that song before. Every night

we try to do some 
song that none of us
know very well, but I
know the words, you .
know, and we wing
it,” Snider said.

And now the soon

ground. Snider 
moves to Memphis
and hones his
singer-songwriter
skillsat the Daily 
Planet. (What a coin- _ 
cidence, isn’t that the /2

After his father pass-
es away he decides
to leave behind the
memories and follow
his girlfriend to
Atlanta. After signing to the
Jimmy Buffett-owned label,
Margaritaville, a Canadian disc
jockey gets a hold of “Seattle

starts playing it. Soon over two
dozen stations have the song
at the top of their request lists,
and the record company’ talks
Snider into putting the track on
Songs From the Daily Planet.
(lt’s Untitled and hidden at the
end.) This lands him opening
slots for Buffett, Drivin’ ‘n’
Cryin’, Bob Dylan, the sub-
dudes, etc. ‘
“Talkin’ Seattle Grunge Rock
Blues” represents the best of
Snider’s sarcastic, cynical jabs
at just about everything and
everyone. lt’s a musician’s

view of trying to get your foot
in the door of the musical
world. (“Now to fit in on the
Seattle Scene/You gotta do
something They ain’t Never
Seen/So thinkin up a gimmick
one day we decided to be the
only band that wouldn’t play a
note.”) Not to be left off his list
of humorous songs is the first
track, My Generation (part 2),
about all our generation has to
be proud of. (“We were raised
up in the hallowed halls/Of half
a million shopping malls/And
there ain’t any price we’re too
proud to pay/ We’ll take any-
thing from Diet Sprite to 1,000
points off light/I admit we’re

_not that bright, but I'm proud

anyway.”)

Explaining the process he
goes through in writing songs,
Snider said, “With the up-
tempo rockers, it’s frustrating
when I’m coming up with those
and I’m totally hearing the
band, but they’re not there.

They’re at their houses  I
don’t want to make it sound
like I can come up with a song
at the drop of a hat, or any-
thing, but I don’t take it very
seriously. I think if I never
come up with another one, I
don’t think that would bother
me. I enjoy ‘emand I come up
with lots of them.” .
Picking up the guitar for th

first time at the age of 19,
Snider says he’s always been
able to play his own songs in
clubs and still afford to eat.
The lack of attention from
record labels has also never
been much of a problem for
the 28-year-old singer/song-
writer. “Record people have
always come around me, it’s
just that they’ve never wanted
me to make a record that I
wanted to make. They always

wanted me to make a record

that they wanted to make.”

Nice Ass
Free Kitten
Kill Rock Stars

“We're Kitten and we’re bet-
ter than you!” The songs on
this album ooze with macho
posturing few “male” rock
bands could ever pull off as
successfully.

I must wholeheartedly agree
with Mr. Trbovich’s' comments
in last week’s Vox regarding
this record. Indeed this album
does rock, and it rocks a bit
more solidly than their last full-
length effort, not to slight that
fine record in the least.

Free Kitten is, in case you
didn't know,. the all-star PUNK
ROCK band of the year. Fuck
whatever those who would
have you listen to the exact
same thing for 20 years want
to call punk, including whoever
it is MTV plays between
Warren G. and that stupid,
pointlessly awful Madonna
bullfighting bullshit, because
real punk rock music will move
you. , F -_

Featuring Pavement’s Mark
lbold on bass as the token
male (anice subversive twist
on the whole “girl bass player”
thing); ,Yoshimi from the
Boredoms on drums, trumpet
and harmonica; Julie Cafritz
from Pussy Galore on vocals
and guitar; and - Kim
Whatshername from Sonic
Whothefucks "also on guitar
and vox, Free Kitten is dope as
dope can be.

The opening track, “Harvest
Spoon,” includes the wonderful
lyric, ‘‘I got a hard-on for you,
and its as long as an album.”

On ‘‘Call Back,” there is
some nice name-dropping
rock-rap better than. the
Beastie Boys ever pulled off
with Rick Rubin’s manipulative
molestation on License to Ill.
“Scratch the DJ” also features
Kim’s gangsta vocals. This
tune also includes a not too

as your soul takes your body
on a rhythmic ride through
music and motion. Does this
sound impossible or illegal?
Well, it’s not. It's legal and it’s
amazing. ‘It's’ called “trance
dancing” or “trancing” and it’s
taking the clubs (and my
dorm room) by storm. This
dance will take you on a trip
that no drug can surpass!
Professor Trance and the
Energisers, an assembly of
trance and ambiance musi-
cians from Florida, have got
your ticket to the whimsical

‘world, supernatural ecstasy.

I know this sounds mystical
and hippie-ish, but believe me
(a cynical skeptic who despis-
es hippies), it works.
Apparently, trance music con-
tains certain elements which,
when applied to a certain
dance technique, awakens
your passion, causes you to
become sexually excited,
empowered and more in tune
to life. You even hallucinate!!!
The music, along with the
dance, actually gives you an
out-of-body experience.

I laughed my ass off when l V

first heard about this “trance”
thing. So I took the ‘Professor’
home with me and put him to
the test. An hour later, l was
sitting in front of my window,
dazedly smoking a cigarette
with a big, fat grin on my face.
I have been taking lessons
from him every night since
then. I had no idea that I had
the ability to “trance” without

having to go to» the strip dis-

trict. This trance music is no
joke! One night, I was tranc-
ing (dancing) for three hours
straight. Crazy!

Professor Trance really did
his homework for this album.
Shaman's Breath is revolu-
tionary. Professor Trance and
the Energisers combine
sacramental drumming from
all over the world with con-
temporary, ambiance, house
and techno music to induce a
state of incorporeal ecstasy.
Trance music is very popular
in the U. K. and a couple of
really cool cities in the states
(Pittsburgh not being one of

_them) such as Washington,

D._C. and Miami. There are
many other trance musicians
from all over the world, or
should l say universe, but in
my opinion the Professor is
the most authentic. The entire
album is incredible! I have
never had an out-of-body
experience with music before
(well, maybe once or twice).
But this was entirely different.

losses, there’s no way
around it,” Stottlemyer
said. “At the time you
don’t think about it, but
when they get older they’11
appreciate that they made
history.”

What’s more impressive
about Pitt’s record is it
wrestled top—notch compe-
tition. All nine losses came
from ranked teams.
Overall, Pitt grappled with

.12 of the nation’s top 25

teams.
“Our schedule is always
like that,” Stottlemyer said.
The Panthers finished the
season on a roll, winning
six of their last eight, with
the losses comingiat the

hands of No. 11 Edinboro~

and No. 12 Clarion.

In addition to beating
Penn State. and Pitt’s sin-
gle—season win record, two
other things happened for
the Panthers this season.
One was their eighth-place

finish at the National duals ’

in Nebraska, where the‘
Panthers defeated then No.»
23 ranked Oregon State
and No. 16 ranked Arizona
State.

The other was the mile-
stone ' reached by
Stottlemyer. .On January
26th, the Panthers’ victory
over Cleveland State gave
Stottlemyer 117 wins for
his career, moving him past
legendary,» coach _R_ex Perry,
in first place on the all-
time victories list.

“l’ve stuck around long
enough to get it,”
Stottlemyer said modestly.

Several Panthers had
great seasons. Fasnacht led
the team with 26 victories,
and Jesko was second on
the team with 23. In his
first year with the team,
Penn State transfer Matusic
finished third on the team
with 20 victories.
Freshman Bodo was
impressive in his first sea-
son, posting 16 wins.

Next up for the Panthers
is the EWL Tournament in
Morgantown, W. Va. The
tournament will be held at
the WVU Coliseum this
weekend.

“This season is far from
over,” Stottlemyer said.
“I’m really anxious about
this weekend —— I can’t
wait. It’s going to be a
four—horse race. We’re kind
of the darkhorse people are
afraid of.” .

record with a ERA of 5.40 last year.

Kramer and Skokowski are the only other
pitchers who had more than 10 appear-
ances for the Panthers.

Pitt won the national stolen base '=.1ltlC last
season, and, according to Jackson, there
will be few changes in strategy this season.

“We may not have as much team speed
as what we've had in the past,” Jackson
said. “Its not really a goal to win the stolen
base championship, its just a product of
our efforts.

“We do have a little more gap power, so
we might ‘get some more extr.a—'base hits.
Our goal is to put up the same offensive
numbers that we did last year.”

Pitt won _its first-ever Big East regular .

season championship last season by sur-
prising almost every team in theleague.
year Jackson sees the league
as wide open and upset-ready. -

“I think everybody is good,” Jackson
said. “Some of the teams picked near the
bottom will do well.”

Seton Hall is the preseason favorite to
win the Big East. Providence, Connecticut,
St. John’s and Villanova will make the

OVISA

road to a second consecutive championship
for Pitt a bumpy one for sure.

“Seton Hall has some really good indi-
vidual players,” Jackson said. “Providence

was a young team and they return every- '

body, UConn is up there every year, St.
John’s is always good and they will be
hungry and Villanova has three good‘ pitch-
ers, so they will be back.”

Pitt begins its season with itsannual trip
to Florida. The Panthers will play 12
games on the trip, beginning on Saturday
when Pitt-plays St. Bonaventure.

The Panthers will also be competing in
the first-ever ECAC Florida Invitational
Baseball Tournament. Pitt opens the tour-
nament against Boston College on
Thursday, March 9. Pitt will also play
‘Hofstra, LaSalle and Fairleigh Dickinson
in the tournament.

“The competition is all Division I
teams,” Jackson said. “The competition is
good, and the schedule is challenging.”

Pitt will return to Pittsburgh to host the
home opener on Wednesday, March 15.
The Panthers will be playing a double-
header against the cross-town rival
Duquesne Dukes.

Whoever said
“the best things in life are free”
pirobably had a trust fund.

natives Andre Alridge,
Jaime Peterson and Orlando
Antigua will add an extra
edge to Pitt’s play.

Add in the fact that each
game seniors Peterson,
Antigua and Chris Gant face
in the tournament may be
their last, and I believe you
have a team that will refuse
to let the preliminary round
game get away from them.
This is the same emotion
which, along with consistent
execution, propelled Pitt to
a victory at the senior
recognition game last
Saturday. That victory, by
the way, came at the
expense of a Providence
team that toppled national
powerhouse UConn 48
hours later.

However, don’t get too
high on the Panthers’
chances of success past
Thursday night, mostly
because Villanova will be
licking its chops while
watching Thursday night’s
games and will most likely
end up meeting the winner
of the Pitt gamethe next
day. Kerry Kittles and com-
pany are eager to prove they
are for real in the Big East
and will probably display it
by thrashing a weary Pitt
squad. Pitt has the ability to
give them‘ a good game, but
Coach of the Year candidate
Steve Lappas will more than
likely lead his troops to a
Saturday semifinal berth."

But in the end it will be
UConn that ‘ smokes
Villanova and therest of the
Big East in an effort to
shore up justification for a
top, seed in the NCAA
Tournament. They were
spanked by Villanova a few
weeks ago, but UConn’s
offensive machine will hit
on all cylinders next week

and cruise to the Big Dance ‘

with very little problems
from other Big East teams.

Whether they survive to
the weekend or not, the
Panthers will deliver excite-
ment, and one. more win as
they conclude a depressing
chapter in Pitt basketball
history.

Trust me, watching the
game will be worth the
effort — even if it costs you
a few minutes on the beach.
Those minutes on the beach
will just become another
blurry memory of Spring
‘Break ‘95.

Much rarer is a Pitt victo-
ry this season.
