Mayoral election heats up summer  
Ravenstahl trounces  
competition in primary

Liz Navratil
News Editor

When Mayor Luke Ravenstahl walked
onto the stage at Hofbrauhaus Pitts-
burgh to celebrate his victory in the
Democratic mayoral primary, he
thanked his family. He also thanked
his campaign staff and those who
voted for him.

He even thanked his competitor,
former police Sgt. Carmen Robin-
son.

Robinson earned 5,916 votes to
Ravenstahl’s 26,848, in the May 19
primary-

Ravenstahl, who local political sci-
ence experts are predicting will win
the general election for mayor this
November, didn’t mention the third
Democratic candidate: City Coun-
cilman Patrick Dowd, who received
12,592 votes.

“My mother once told me if you

don’t have anything nice to say, you
shouldn’t say anything at all,” Raven-
stahl said. “So I decided to do that.”

Dowd conceded around 10 p.m.

Ravenstahl, who walked on stage
to The Who’s “Baba O’Riley,” told sup-
porters that hewas excitedtowork on
his 11-step plan forthe city“as earlyas
tomorrow moming.”

Ravenstahl’s plan puts an emphasis

on strengthening the health care and —

education industries, continuingriver—
front development and mergingwith
Allegheny County, along with other
iniu'at1'ves.

“I can’t wait to take this suit-coat '

off and roll up my sleeves as each of
you do when you go to work,” said Ra-
venstahl, who joked that he ran for
ofﬁce more times than members of
Congress. This was his third round
of elections in two years.

Dowd watched the election re-
sults with his campaign at the Church
BrewWorks. He beganhis concession

Students
could sway  
fall elections

Liz Navratil
News Editor

This November, Pittsburgh resi-
dents will elect their next mayor,
judges, city council members and
other officials.

Pitt students account for an
average of 5,000 votes during a
national election, giving them in—
ﬂuence over local politics, if they
choose to mark their ballots. V

To keep you up to speed, The
Pitt News will followthe elec-
tions throughout the‘ fall. But to
understand how the elections will
unfold, you’ll need to understand
what’s already happened.

The next few pages contain a
look backon this May’s primary
elections and their aftermath.

We’ll concentrate primarily on
the mayoral election.

ofhaving compeﬁtion in the primary
race, even though he said many people
told him it  impossible to beat an
incumbent.‘ A A

“We generated public discourse
about issues important to the city,”
Dowd said.

He attributed part of the campaign
losstobeingoutspent“tremendously”

byRavenstahl’s campaign, althougliwhish

campaig‘nwas«rue1ea and energized”
by 606 campaign contributors.

Dowd said every dayhis team talk-
ed about ﬁnances, youth violence and
cleaning up neighborhoods, and that
thiswas themost meaningﬁil outcome
of die race. d

“This is just the beginning,” he
said. “We pledge not to let these con-
versations disappear.”

He said the campaignplanstohold
leadership accountable.

“We all have to get up tomorrow i

to improve the quality of life in Pitts-

burgh,” Dowd said. .
EveTicker, aDowd supporterwho

awaited results with the campaign at

‘ ~27-

the Church Brew Works, said the re-
sults were good consideringhow much
Ravenstahl outspent Dowd.

“It’s a clear statement that what’s
been happening is not enough,” she
said. “This speaks to people’s dissat-
isfaction very well.”

She said whether hewins or loses,
the campaign is stillwinning, because
it’s “bringing issues to light.”

Another Dowd supporter, Alaina

__ ,mz'

-rDopico,' said the late startloflthe cam-

paign hurt Dowd’s chances but that
she would “love” to see Dowd run for
mayor again.

Dowd said he wanted to look over
the election results before deciding
whether he would run as awrite-in
candidate duringtl1e general election
in November.

Back in Oakland, election turnout
was disappointing for some. '

Oakland resident Steve Sortinohas

the polls closed, 54 people had come
to the station to vote. About 700 came
to vote forthe presidentinNovember,
Sortino said.

“It changed everything,” he said.
Or at least he thought it would.

Most of the people who voted in
November were college students, he
said. The majority of the others were

Sortino said he thought part of the

because itwas a_ primary. V

He said he hoped the turnout
wouldbe bet1terinNovember’s general
election, when the college students
had returned and Independents could
vote. He said the turnout is normally
larger at general and national elec-
tions, simplybecause peoplefeel they
have alarger impact. _ _

City police to enforce curfew for minors
Police take minors off streets, into
curfew center on North Dithridge

Joe Kennedy
Staﬁ' Writer

Police hope a new curfew center
coming to Oakland will not only
keep kids off the streets, but also
help to solve the problems that put
them there.

Regina McDonald, assistant
city police chief, said curfew viola-
tions are signals of a troubled home
life and that the center, located on
North Dithridge Street, gives police
an opportunity to help solve deeper
issues.

“Many of these young people lack
proper parental/adult supervision,”
McDonald wrote in an e—mail. “If we
are able to intervene intheir lives, we
may be able to identify needs and put
them and their families in contact
with agencies that might be able to

address those needs.”

The center, which will be run

by nonproﬁt agency Three Rivers
Youth, will be used to house minors
whom police catch breaking curfew.
Three Rivers Youth aids abused, ne-
glected and runaway or homeless
children and their families.

The building at 200 North
Dithridge St., which currently houses
a women’s emergency shelter, is set
to be converted on Sept. 3.

McDonald said placing the center
on North Dithridge Street — where
many Oakland parties are held —
might also keep college students off
the street.

“Many of the neighbors feel that
the increased police presence inthe
neighborhood will encourage col-
lege kids to act more responsibly
and considerate of their neighbors,”
she said.

But some students don’t think
the extra police attention will keep
party-goers away for too long.

“At ﬁrst, people will be wonder-

ing why the police will be there, but
soon word will spread, people will
ﬁgure out why and go right back
out,” Andre Crathers, a Pitt junior
majoring in mechanical engineering,
said. “Kids are going to be kids.”

L] Kim, a University of Califor-
nia Berkeley student who lived on
North Dithridge Street while taking
courses at Pitt this summer, said she
thought the center would cause more
problems than it would solve.

“It’s a little foolish to put a bunch
of delinquent teenagers in one spot,”
she said.

Three Rivers Youth said in its
proposal to the city that it wanted to
build the center in Oakland because
the neighborhood has easy access
to Port Authority bus routes and is
home to the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, which could treat
any of the minors who have health
problems.

Still, the idea is nothing new.

Curfew law comes with
multitude of loopholes

Joe Kennedy
Stajf Writer

Breaking down the law

Police will take minors — chil-
dren 17 and younger —— who are
out past curfew to the center.

During the summer, curfew
runs from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Sun-
day. Beginning Thursday, Sept.
1 — after most city children and
teenagers are back in school
—— curfew is from 10 p.m. to 6
a.m. On Fridays and Saturdays
year-round, curfew begins at
midnight.

However, there is one catch:
Curfew law states that young peo-
ple who are on their way home or
to the place of a guardian, run-
ning an errand, or involved in
an emergency are exempt from
police jurisdiction if they are
stopped after curfew.

» and may opt to have therapeutic

ter, the minor is given a mental
and physical health evaluation

counseling.

At 14 years old, however, a mi-
nor visiting the center can refuse
counseling.

City Council President Doug
Shields said he thinks the law
makes it too easy for minors to
avoid being taken in to the cen-
ter.

“All someone has to do is say,
‘I’m on my way home,’ and [po-
lice] have to let them go,” Shields
said.

Peggy Harris, president and
CEO of Three Rivers Youth -
the organization overseeing the
center — said she hopes police
will “exercise good judgment”
in determining if they are being
lied to.

She says signs like aggravated
and intoxicated behavior could

tip off police.

Shields: $500,000 allotted for center  

Curfew 4 12

The city established a curfew in its
Public Safety Building, Downtown,
in 1996. The center later moved to
the old West End police station, but
eventually closed because ofbudget
cuts. The center’s closure essentially
suspended the city’s curfew law be-
cause police had nowhere to take its
violators, McDonald said.

“The ordinance was not enforced
because we didn’t have anywhere to
take the offenders,” she said.

Councilman Bill Peduto, a sup-
porter of the bill, said he thinks the
center’s new location and set—up
should make it successful this time
around.

He said he thought the Victori-
an-style house on Dithridge Street
would feel more like a “home” than
the previous one.

Three Rivers Youth will provide
24beds, along with meals and cloth-

ing, for the minors brought in to the
center.

But City Council President Doug
Shields, who voted against the cen-
ter, thinks the idea is “wholly inef—
fective.”

Shields said that the $500,000
set aside for the curfew center, which
covers both the building and some
of the counseling Three Rivers Youth
provides, would be better spent on
parks and recreation in areas with
high crime.

“There. is no outreach in the
community to direct kids into the
right lifestyle,” Shields said. He
said “meaningful programming”
like summer reading and baseball
camps would provide local youths
with the activity and guidance that
he feels is necessary to avoid future
problems.

Peggy Harris, president and CEO

of Three Rivers Youth, said the cur-
few center will help to solve a long
chain of issues — starting with the
immediate safety of the minors.

“The fact that children are out
in the streets puts them at risk for
victimization,” Harris said. She said
the presence of a minor in the streets
is “symptomatic of issues at home,”
such as parental substance abuse,
family dysfunction and neglect.

She said she hopes the center’s
counseling services will help reveal
problems like these, and she and her
staff members will work to connect
families to parenting, therapy and
drug abuse groups. The center will
follow with the families 30, 60 and
90 days after they join these groups.
Center workers will looks for signs
of increased family involvement
and better functionality to assess
the groups’ impact.

There is no outreach in ‘the community to direct kids
into the right lifestyle. 0 '

election results in Iran. The follow-

Rose wanted to speak but
couldn’t say her real name.

“I’m going to Iran  to visit fam
ily,” she said. “I’m scared of getting
in trouble.”

She wore a surgical face mask
over her mouth to conceal her iden-
tity, but she exposed her teeth mo-
mentarily as she adjusted the mask
to breathe better.

Protesters raise awareness of reformist views

Signs decorating Bigelow Boulevard call for a new election on the other side of the world

Iran 4 18

Ahmadinejad, president of Iran.

Early this pastjune, Ahmadine-
jad beat reformist Mir-Hossein
Mousavi in‘ the country’s presi-
dential election. But a speedy vote
count, secret police movements on
the election night and abreakdown
in results that don’t match those
predicted threw the election’s re-
sults into question, initially causing
thousands to protest throughout
Iran.

Rose said she was worried for her
brothers’ safety, because she had
heard reports on the news and from
her family that Iranian police were
using force to stop the protests.

A recent doctorate graduate
at Pitt now pursuing postdoctoral
studies, Rose couldn't attend the
protests with her brothers or warn
them of potential dangers.

But she was able to stand in pro-
test with Pittsburgh’s Iranian com-
munity on Bigelow Boulevard to try
to make sure passers-by received
her message.

“The most important goal for
me is to tell people he is not re-
ally our president,” Rose said. “Do
not recognize Ahmadinejad as our
president.”

Rose stood in a crowd of about
40 protesters, most of whom were
born in Iran and said they just
wanted to show their support for
relatives back home and to show
the local community the differences
between the Iranian government
and its people. They crowded the

‘ William Pitt Union side of Bigelow

Boulevard and held signs showing
their support.

“Down with the dictator,” some
of the signs read. “Ahmadinejad Get
Out!”

“Ahmadinejad should pay the
price for all the lives we lost,” an-
other sign read. “Our crime is seek-
ing freedom.”

One sign read, “Honk for democ-
racy,” and many people driving by
responded accordingly. When driv-
ers honked, the protesters shouted,
“Mash’allah,” which means, “God
bless you.”

“In our culture, if someone
says something you like and you
don’t want it to be jinxed, you say
‘Mash’allah,’” Sorna Javadi, a Pitt
graduate student, said .

]ava'di, who moved to the United
States with his parents when hewas
14, said he was angry aboutthis elec-

tion. He was convinced that the
majority of people in Iran voted for
Mousavi and that the Iranian gov-
ernment had rigged the election.

He held a sign showing a picture
of Ahmadinejad that had been al-
tered to add the signature black hair
and mustache of Adolf Hitler.

“We’re trying to say that Hitler
is reincarnated in the body of Ah-
madinejad,”]avadi said.

Javadi supported Mousavi in the
election like many young Iranians
who saw him as a more reformist
choice than Ahmadinejad. Javadi
even voted for him, or at least he
tried. '

Many polling stations were set
up across the United States and
across the world to allow Iranian
citizens living abroad to cast their
votes, including a station at Penn
State, to whichjavadi drove the day
of the election.

But when he arrived at 6 p.m.,
only two hours after the election had
oflicially started in Iran, he heard

Ahrnadinejad had already won. So -

he said he had no reason to vote.
‘.‘Forty-ﬁve million votes counted

in two hours!” Javadi exclaimed.

“That’s another big mystery.”

Even thoughjavadi said Mousavi
was notan ideal candidate for many
young Iranians, he wanted Mousavi
to win.

“Mousavi represents a new way
in Iran‘, different from the old way
of Ahmadinejad,” he said. ‘Ah-
madinejad’s deﬁnition of democracy
is, ‘You do what we say and don’t
complain.”’ ‘ .

A few feet away fromjavadi, an-
other student expressed her anger

about the election by trying to lead I

a chant: “It was not an election: It
was a selection!”

The 27-year-old Pitt civil engi-
neering ‘student also wanted to re-
main anonymous. Her family mem-
bers and friends live in Tehran, and
they are all Mousavi supporters.

“My friends keep telling me b

about the rallies, and they sound
beautiful,” she said.

She has not decided about when
or if she wants to return to her native
country, but she said she still cares
about its future.

“Our reputation is so screwed up
currently,” she said. “The reformist
candidate will give us a better repu-
tation worldwide —— something that
Iran deserves.”

She said she doesn’t like the‘

current laws in Iran, calling them
“twisted and male" oriented.”

“[In the United States], I-feel I am
more equal to a man,” she said. “In
Iran, they make us wear mandatory

_ veils that coverthe s ' .”

At the protest, she wore shorts

and a short-sleeve shirt, exposing -

her skin. She continued to lead
chants in support of her Iranian
friends and family back home.
Across the street in front of the
Cathedral fountain, Amir Moghimi

passed out ﬂiers to educate passers- ’

by about the protest.

I Moghimi’s mother is American,
and his father is Iranian. He’s lived
in the United States of and on for
10 years and spent the rest of his
time in Iran.

“When you live in one society,”

- Moghimi said, “youthinkyou know

the way things work. People accept
things without thinking about them,:
in both America and Iran.”

But Moghimi has noticed more
than differences between his two
cultures. I ‘ I

tions, but basically the same,” he said.

Moghimi said he saw people risking their
lives for these values in Iran, and he wanted
to show the world how much he supports
their efforts.

He said he voted for Mousavi because he
saw him as a more moderate alternative to
Ahmadinejad.

“Ahmadinejad is a hard-line, right-wing,
ﬁindamentalist conservative, and all the usual
problems of hard-line, right-wing, fundamen-
talist conservatives apply in this situation,”

  

   
  

he said.

Back in the crowd of protesters, Omid
Moghimi clapped when another car honked.
Moghimi, who is a junior at Pitt, completed
most of his primary schooling in Iran, where
he lived before he and his family moved to the
United States.

Moghimi said he felt suspicious of Ah-
madinejad’s victory because he thought Ah-
madinejad had failed to fulﬁll his original
campaign promises from his previous elec-
tion victory in 2005.

Last summer, Moghimi traveled to Tehran.
He was out of the country for only two years,
but much had changed.

“Electricity was being cut off fortwo hours
every day — during the hottest hours of the
day,” Moghimi said.

He also said car and gas prices increased
dramatically, and people didn’t have enough
money to pay for rice, tea, meat and spices
— staples of the Iranian diet.

“Ahmadinejad’s ﬁrst election was run on
an economic platform,” Moghimi said. “He

was going to put Iran’s oil money on people’s
tables, but he didn’t do anything.”

In addition to feeling angry about what
he saw as Ahmadinejad’s economic failure,
Moghimi said he feels angry about §hmadine-
jad’s human rights record. Moghimi said he
wants to see a return of basic freedoms in Iran,
especially the right for women to walk down
streets in any clothing they choose.

Moghimi’s father, a university professor,
will soon teach a course at Tehran University,
where more than 100 faculty members re-
signed in protest of the’ election results”. ' ‘

Moghimi said he doesn’t know what

_ will happen in Iran, but he knows what he

wants. «
“'Ifhe4No_. .1gdi_f_ference between America and

I  Iran is that here you feel 1i1;é‘y6u  do 
’ much whatever you want,” he said.

Protests remind
people of ongoing

Students continued to protest international
issues on campus this summer, even though
they realized many people probably weren’t

. listening.

. “I don’t think anybody realistically hopes
to accomplish much,” Amir Moghami, a grad-
uate student at Carnegie Mellon, said. -

But sometimes, just getting the word out
there is enough to fulﬁll their goal of starting
a discussion about international issues.

Moghami and other students at Carnegie

Mellon and Pitt protested late this June on *

the re—election of Iranian President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad. Moghami said his group
wanted to support people who were injured
or died during larger, more volatile protests
in Iran. ' g _ ‘ ' '
Moghami said rallies might not incite
immediate change, but as long as the public
pays attention, the group is making progress.

.He said the demonstrations are successful

“even if’it’s as much as [people] continuing
to follow the Iran news so that it doesn’t
become a dead story.”

Students who protested when the Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂict peaked this winter had
a similar view.

Members of both the Hilleljewish Univer-
sity Center and Students forjustice in Pales-

_ tine took action in Oakland after Israel led a
' military attack on the Palestinian-‘controlled

Gaza Strip in response to increased Palestin-

separate ideologies would motivate the two
groups to start a discussion about ways to
ﬁnd a peaceful resolution to the conﬂict.

“If you can have conversations among
students, perhaps you’ll have a generation
that won’t be shooting [in the Middle East] ,”
Weil said. “It all starts with dialogue.”

But Students for Justice in Palestine
President Jonas Moffat said there is much
to be done before the groups can form a
solution.

“There was talk about having an open
debate with SIP and Hillel,” Moffat said.
“I have not heard any more of the debate
since, but we are deﬁnitely open to a healthy
debate.” .

Mike Epitropoulos, a history professor at
Pitt, said these public demonstrations are a
natural part of the democratic process.

“Protests, civil disobedience’, direct ac-
tion and dissent are necessary elements in
real democracy,” he said, adding that pro-
tests have yielded “tangible results” during
American struggles for labor, civil and wel-
fare rights, but these exhibitions are just one
of many possible tools of change.

Melissa Minnich, communications direc-
tor at the Thomas Merton Center, agreed.

She said her organization, which formed
in 1972 to protest the Vietnam War, views
protesting as more of a “means to an end”
thana solution in itself. She said she be-
lieves public education is one of the more
important parts of the process that mem-
bers use to protest local and world hunger,
the exploitation of workers, militarism and
racial discrimination.

The Thomas Merton Center holds pub-

lic forums, panel discussions and teach—ins

to inform the community about issues it
protests. The center also runs a monthly
newspaper that discusses activist issues and
advertises events like the National Anti-War
Conference, which it organized. _

Still, some are set on protesting.

The Pittsburgh Organizing Group, a self-
described anarchist group that has protested
events such as the war in Iraq, could not be
reached for comment, but said on its website
that it plans to stand toe-to-toe with the
4,000 Pittsburgh police officers who will be
on duty during the G-20 Summit Downtown
this September.

The group said its goal is to promote “the
creation of a directly democratic, free soci-
ety capable of maximizing human potential
and freedom.  In short  Anarchism.”

Epitropoulos said the manner in which

P-ittsburgh residents respond to opposition '

groups like the Pittsburgh Organizing Group
will say a lot about the city.

“Will we respond with a respect for our
great American freedom to disagree and
protest, or will we react with clubs, tear gas
and unreasonable tactical restrictions by riot
police‘? I’m betting on the latter,” he said.

City, campus prepare for upcoming G-20 Summit

Liz Navratil
News Editor,

ext month, thousands of diplomats

and journalists will descend upon .

Pittsburgh for the G—2o Summit.
You’ve probably heard about it in the news.
But do you have any idea what it actually is?
Here’s a Pitt News breakdown of what you
should know before the Summit begins.
What is the G—2o?
At least once a year, the leaders of 19 na-
tions and the European Union meet to discuss
economic growth and redevelopment. They

call themselves the Group of Twenty, or the
G-20 for short. Together, the members of the
G-20 represent two-thirds of the world’s pop-
ulation and about 85 percent of its wealth.

Members of the G-20 include
representatives from:

—-Argentina
' —Australia

—Brazil

——Canada

—China

—The European Union
—France

—Germany
—India
—Indonesia
—Italy
—-—Japan
——Mexico
—Russia
—Saudi Arabia
—South Africa
—South Korea

their ﬁnance ministers or central bank gov~
emors, representatives who oversee their
nations’ —— orthe European Union’s — bank-
ing systems.

But earlier this year, the G-20 held its ﬁrst
Leaders’ Meeting in London. Members sent
their heads of state —— i.e., presidents, prime
ministers and the like —— and they vowed
to have them meet again before the end of
the year.

The Pittsburgh Summit, which will be held
from Sept. 24 to 25, will be the second Leaders’
Meeting, meaning people like U.S. President
Barack Obama and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy, will walk the streets of Pittsburgh.

Why Pittsburgh?

. Obama offered duringpthe,Lor_1_dor_1 Sum-

mit this spring to host the G426 in the United if

States this fall because many of the group’s

leaders will already be in the country for a U.N. -

General Assembly meeting this September,
Obama’s press secretary, Robert: Gibbs, said
in a news conference in May.

G-20 members typically meet in locations
that showcase the kind of economic recovery
and redevelopment they are trying to pro-
mote — hence why the Summit will come
to Pittsburgh.

“I think [Pittsburgh’s] an area that has
seen its share of economic woes in the past,
but because of foresight and investment, is
now renewed —— giving birth to renewed
industries that are creating the jobs of the
future,” Gibbs said. “And I think the president
believes it would be a good place to highlight
some of that.”

Where in Pittsburgh will the Summit
be held? ’

The majority of the Summit will occur in
the David L. Lawrence Convention Center,
one of the world’s ﬁrst “green” convention
centers, Downtown. ' .

First lady Michelle Obama will host several
events in other locations, including Oakland.
The White House has yet to release the times
for these events, but has released their loca-
tions.

Michelle and Barack Obama will meet the
other leaders and their spouses at Phipps
Conservatory, where they will host a “work-
ing dinner.” S

The ﬁrst ladywill host the leaders’ spouses

‘ at Rosemont Farm, the home of Teresa Heinz,

of Heinz ketchup fame — she’s -also married
to U.S. Sen.]ohn Kerry, D-Mass. The farm is
located in Fox Chapel, a suburb northeast
of the city.

Michelle Obama and others will tour the
Pittsburgh High School for Creative and Per-
forming Arts, Downtown. The school serves
about 800 students, who major in subjects
like dance, theater and the arts. t

The ﬁrst lady will also hold a luncheon in

Why should I care?

On the simplest level, the Summit will af-
fect transportation and business operations
throughout the city. Students will probably
ﬁnd themselves stuck in traffic if they’re trying
to move anywhere near the Summit sites.

Each of the leaders will travel with a se-
curity staff, and thousands of j oumalists are
expected to come to the city and its suburbs
to cover the Summit. Past Summits have at-

tracted thousands of protesters, as well.
City and county officials of varying levels
have said at news conferences this summer
that moving throughout the city will be more
diﬂicult during the Summit and in the days
leading up to it, given the inﬂux of people.
Officials said they won’t be able to predict
exactly how transportation and local busi-
nesses will be affected until the ﬁnal itinerary
is released, which might be as late as a few
weeks before the Summit. They encouraged
local business leaders to begin brainstorming

fashion and to stock up on their supplies far
in advance of the Summit.

Then, there’s the angle professors will take
on the Summit:

“It’s got an educational signiﬁcance.
There’s no doubt about it,” Martin Staniland,
a professor in the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, said.

He said he expects community groups to
hold conferences before the Summit -— events
that can help explain its signiﬁcance and teach
people a bit about international economics.
Staniland said the Summit also go resents

Officials anticipate transportation problems

an “enormous opportunity” for the city to
redeﬁne its image. A

When Gibbs announced that the Summit
would be held in Pittsburgh, members of the
White House press corps laughed.

“It was quite clear from the press’ reac-
tion at the press conference that there’s still
a very distorted picture of what Pittsburgh’s
like, even now,” he said, noting how the city
has changed from a place for steel mills to an
econornically-stable area focusing on health
care and education.

Both Allegheny County Executive Dan
Onorato and city Mayor Luke Ravenstahl
have said they look forward to showcasing
the changes Pittsburgh has made. Both have
said repeatedly that they hope to showcase
the area’s efforts to become more environ-
mentally friendly.

“This is Pittsburgh’s chance to show visi-
tors the world over a ﬁrst-class time in our
ﬁrst-class city,” Ravenstahl said in a news
release after the Summit location was an-
nounced.

The skeptics

While government oﬂicials are eager to
tout the beneﬁts of hosting the Summit, some
people are skeptical. -

Earlier this summer, city and county offi-
cials hosted brainstorming sessions inwhich
Pittsburgh residents could suggestways to
prepare for the Summit. ,

‘ Several people, including former Pitt stu-
dentjonas Moffat, said they wondered what
the city was going to do to protect people’s
constitutional rights to protest.

An estimated 4,000 people protested in
London prior to the Summit meeting this
past’April. Much of it was peaceful, accord-
ing to the British newspaper The Guardian,
“but some bloody skirmishes broke out as
police tried to keep thousands of people in
containment pens.” Numerous investigations
into suspected police brutality followed the
London Summit. .

_ Diane Richard, a spokeswoman for the city
police, said in an e—mail that city oﬂicers are
trained to only interrupt protests if people
present a danger to themselves, to those
around them or to nearby property. “ V" V

‘ ' '_“‘The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police does not
wish to violate any person’s First Amendment
right to freedom of speech,” she said. “If indi-
viduals wish to protest in an orderly and civil
manner without engaging in any type of civil
disruption/disturbance that can put other
people and property at risk and in harm’s
way, it is unconstitutional to be denied the
right to express the First Amendment right
of freedom of speech.”

A man at one of the G—20 brainstorming
sessions suggested to see whether Pittsburgh
residents really want to hold the G-20 or
whether it’s simply something being pro-
moted by businesses and special interest
groups.

Tuition increase could come with extra fees  

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Pitt student Brittany Moreland said she doesn’t
know what she will do to cope with this year’s
tuition increases. V

She already works three days per week, and
she switched her major from pre—medicine to
business partially because she “didn’t have time
to study.”

“It’s difficult,” she said. “It’s a lot to bal-
ance.”

        
 
  
    

Still, thisyear’s tuition increase of $562 isthe
lowest the University has passed in 10 years.

But additional fees might come, depending
on how much —— or how little — Pitt receives
from the stimulus package.

The executive and budget committees ofPitt’s
Board of'I‘rustees voted unanimouslylast month
to increase tuitionfor students inthe University’s
colleges of Arts and Sciences, General Studies,
Education, SocialWork and Dental Medicine by
$512 to $13,344. Out—of-state students in those

collegeswillpay $562 more, astheirtuition rises

to $23,042.

While the ofﬁcial tuitionrate isset, Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg said inthe meetings inPosvar
Hall that students might have to pay additional
fees as early as this fall if the University doesn’t
get as much money as it would like from state
legislators and the federal stimulus. .

Nordenberg said he couldn’t predictthevalue
of any surcharges, or additional fees, because he
didn’t know the status of the stimulus package.
When the paper went to the printer, state legis-
lators still hadn’t passed a budget, so he didn’t
know how much state funding the University

. could depend on, either.

' a year later.

State legislators, more than a month past
their deadline, were still sparring over a budget
when the paper wentto the printer, largely over
how much money to give to higher education.
State appropriations account for an average of
10 to 11 percent of Pitt’s budget.

Further complicating the matter were Gov.
Ed Rendell’s attempts to exclude the four state-
related schools — Pitt, Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln universities -— from Pennsylvania’s ap-
plication for stimulus ﬁmds because the institu-
tions were not “under the absolute control of the
Commonweal .” .

After receivingletters from numerous Univer-
sity administrators and 14 of Pennsylvania’s 19
U.S. representatives, ofﬁcials inthe U.S. Depart-
ment of Education told Rendell to rewrite the

state’s application to include the state-related

schools.“ _ ,
Nordenberg said not knowing how much

Clinton supports blogging at Netroots convention

Former president advises bloggers to push health care reform and keep people honest

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Bill Clinton is all for blogging.

The former U.S. president said he was
ﬂipping through articles he had collected
on health care "reform and climate change
not too long ago, when he realized that he’d

saved more clips from blogs than he had _,

from newspapers. .
And then there’s the fact that he thanked

about 1,800 bloggers and political activ-
ists gathered for a conference Downtown
Aug. 13 for “dramatically elevating our
public discourse” through blogs and other
online forums.

But, he added, “I’m pleading with you.
It’s okay if you want to keep people honest
 but keep this within the lane of getting
things done.” ’

=Clinton’s speech was the keynote ad-
dress for Netroots Nation, a convention

for people who use the Internet — whether

it’s through blogging, Facebook, Twitter
or any other number of tools —— to spark
political action. From Aug. 13-16, the con-
ference attendees, who call themselves
netroots, attended sessions in the David
Lawrence Convention Center discussing
topics ranging_from how to use the Inter-
net to prompt political activism, to how to
understand the idiosyncrasies of Congress,
to how to separate the hype of Twitter from
its reality, among other subjects.

The netroots, mostly 20-something
to middle-aged liberals judging from the

.crowd’s numerous standing ovations and

rounds of applause, blog largely to hold
their government leaders accountable for
their actions, said Chuck Rocha, politi-
cal director for the United Steelworkers
labor union. ,

“At the end of the day, we want the have-
nots to have a say  They’re sick and tired
of being sick and tired,” said Rocha, one

_‘Of more than a half dozen people to speak

before the slightly red-faced and hoarse
former president last night.

Rocha praised the netroots for helping
elect current President Barack Obama,
who used Facebook among other tools to
spread word while campaigning.

“It’s up to us to make this president do

what he promised he would do,” Rocha
said. “It’s up to us to keep the pressure
on.” ' T
Clinton ‘told the bloggers they “hold
the seeds in a generation” where public
discourse dominates much of the Internet.
People who read blogs trust the informa-
tion they contain and tend to attribute
any errors to “the head, not the heart,”
meaning that they would be honest mis-
takes and not intentions to mislead people,
Clinton said.

He encouraged people to use that power
to push for health care reform and climate-
changing initiatives. _

Clinton said Obama’s election was the
first one in which people were “self—con-
sciously communitarian —— understanding
we are going to rise and fall together.”

“We live in an interdependent nation
and an interdependent world,” he had said
just moments before.

All of that being recognized, he said
he also asked bloggers to express a little
patience. Major change, such as improve-

; ments in the economy or improvements in
"funding for higher education, take time he

said, adding that the right kindspf political
activism could cause change to continue
for the next 30 to 40 years.

“I’d like to see more blog sites say, ‘This
is what I’d like to see President Obama do,
and this is what I’d like to see Congress do
 and, dear readers, this is what you can
do,” Clinton said. “Don’t get downtrodden,
and don’t get pessimistic  We should

Cyclists memorialize
Oakland accident victim

bosky, a member of the bicycle advocacy
group Bike PGH, chained awhite—painted bi-
cycle to a street sign near the intersection.
It was there that, two days earlier, the
driver of a white pickup truck hit Rui Hui
Lin, of Dawson Street, while he was riding
his bicycle. Police, who arrived at the scene
after the driver left, took Lin, 38, to UPMC

V Presbyterian, where he died later that eve-

ning, according to a news release from the
city police. »

Timothy Kish, ofjeiferson Hills, told po-
lice two days after the accident — the same
day as the memorial — that he was the driver
who hit Lin, according to the same news re-
lease. Police charged Kish, 51, with one count
of an accident involving death or personal
injury. ’ ,

One by one, each mournei‘ at the vigil
placed ﬂowers and lit candles at the base of
the ghost bike to pay their respects to the
deceased. 5

Ghost Bike ceremonies are memorials for _

bicyclists hit or killed on the street. A bicycle
is painted white and chained to a street sign
near where the cyclist was hit. The ﬁrst formal
Ghost Bike ceremonies were created in St.
Louis in 2003. Pittsburgh became the second
city after St. Louis to host a ghost bike memo-
rial, beginning with one in May 2004. “
Drombosky spoke to the‘ crowd that

- gathered, saying Lin’s death should_remind

cyclists, drivers and pedestrians alike that
Safety is an issue that affects everyone.

“Even if you don’t ride bikes, everyone
here is affected by other people’s actions,”
he said.

Although Bike PGH doesn’t ofﬁcially spon-
sor Ghost Bike ceremonies, the organization’s
mission is to establish Pittsburgh as a city that
is increasingly safe, accessible and friendly
to bicycle transportation.

Scott Bricker, executive director of Bike
PGH, said cyclists and drivers need to prac-
tice safer habits if they are going to work

“If you are on a bike, stop at a stop sign,”
Bricker said. “We are in acity, so there will
be people driving and walking. We all need
to look out for everybody.” -

Allie Bolea, a cyclist and Pitt graduate,
agreed. »

“Pittsburgh is a great city to ride in, but
people just need to watch out,” she said.
“Wearing helmets, riding in well-‘lit streets
and staying away from busy streets are just
some things I do to keep safe.“

The ghost bike will remain chained to
the sign on the corner of Meyran Avenue

and Louisa Street until it is removed by the

city. The last time the group put up a ghost
bike, when a cyclist was hit on Craig Street,
the city left the bike there for three days,
Drombosky said.

Sestak challenges Specter for Senate

Elham Khatami
Senior Staﬁ Writer

U.S. Rep.Joe Sestak, D-Delaware County,
announced outside Soldiers & Sailors Me-
morial Hall on Aug. 4 that he’ll run for
one of Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate seats,
challenging incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter
in the 2010 Democratic primary.

“If there’s any part in Pennsylvania

that’s notable for making opportunity
out ‘of adversity, it’s right here,” he said
outside the Oakland memorial.

Earlier that day, Sestak announced his
decision in his hometown of Folsom, Pa.,
the seventh congressional district, which
he represents. The district encompasses
parts of the Philadelphia suburbs.

“I think, most importantly, this is an
opportunity to reclaim those core prin-
ciples of hard work, honesty and account-

said.

He said the current race is “not about
Arlen,” who switched his party affiliation
from Republican to Democratic in April..

“It’s about the good Pennsylvanians,”
he said, adding that one of the differences
between him and Specter is that Sestak has
not voted with former President George
W. Bush. “I went to Washington to oppose
the policies of President Bush.”

Students solve problems through

exchange program to Tanzania

Brandon Ellis
Staﬁ” Writer

randon B/lache-Cohen remembers his A

water walk in Tanzania, when he tried to
walk in the shoes of another person.

It was part of an immersion course offered
by Amizade, a nonproﬁt organization based in
Pittsburgh. Amizade offers global service leam—
ingprojectsto students through afom1alparmer—
ship with West Virginia University.

For one day, Blache-Cohen simulated a task
that women are expected to repeat every day of
their adult lives —— walkingthree to six miles to
get dirty water.

“This was a grueling task,” he said. “It’s
not like walking  from the Cathedral to Ward
Street.”

Heﬁrstwalked downamountaintofetchthe
water. Then, with more than 20 liters of water
on his back, he walked back up the slope to the
village.

But unlike some women living in rural west
Tanzania, he didn’t have to repeat the walk mul-
tiple times until the village had enough water.

This was one year ago. Since then, Blache—
Cohen has become director of operations for
Amizade’s Pittsburgh oﬂice.

Lastjuly, he monitored the progress of an-
other group of 12 students in Tanzaniawho took
the same ﬁve-week course he did.

One of those students was Elizabeth Rahner,
aPitt sophomore who said she knew she wanted
to travelto Tanzania aiterraising moneyinhigh
school for water wells in Tanzanian villages.

She attended a study abroad fair at Pitt and
said she noticed Amizade’s Tanzania program.

“With my previous interest in Tanzania and
international development, it was a perfect ﬁt for
me,” Rahner, who participated in the program
with three other Pitt students, said.

Part ofRahner’s j ob in Tanzania was to inter-
view women about their access to clean water,
food and medical treatment.

“It was sobering for a lot of us,” Rahner
said about her ﬁrst interview with a Tanzanian
woman.

The single womanwas raisingsixchildrenby
herself, living in a room no larger than the size

August 2 5, 2009 I The Pitt News I ww.W.pittnews.com

of Rahner’s living room.

“I kept asking her straightforward questions
like, ‘Do you eat enough food?’ But she just kept
sayingno,”Rahnersaid. “Itputaface onextrerne
poverty.”

Blache—Cohen said neither he nor his col-
leagues have all the answers for international
development, butthey startfrom basic principles
that mightmake animpact. —-

By reading books on international develop-
ment, he said he learned that “throwing money at
aproblemwith coordinated effortmightchange

THE Orncr er tress tn

the worl .”

That’s exactlyhow Blache—Cohen and Rahner
addressed the problem of the water walk.

From interviews with local women inTanza-
nia, they discovered howwalking miles to getwa-
ter every day hinders all aspects of development.
When they could be starting a small business or
taking classes in English or Swahili, women don’t
have time to do anything except fetch water.

The students from Amizade provided them
the tools and labor to build rainwater tanks de-
signed to collect the water from rooftops.

Instead of the rainwater draining onto the
ground, it now sluices through drain pipes into
2,o00—liter tanks that can hold water for long
periods of time.

Another problem thatAmizade identiﬁed —
with help from other international organizations
like the Women Emancipation and Development

, Agency andthe FamilyAlliance for Development
’ and Cooperation —— was an excess ofbananas.

WestemTanzaniaislushwithbananaplanta-
tions. When Blache-Cohenﬁrst entered Tanzania

throughthe Ugandanborder, plains ofbrown and

green banana trees welcomed him. . '

“Duringbananaharvesting season, there are
so many bananas that farmers give them away
_forfree,” Blache—Cohen said. “They throw them
into the street for anyone to pick up.”

But during the times when bananas are not
growing, people starve.

Amizade students partnered with the Family
Alliance for Development and Cooperation to
address the problem. V

With new agrotechnology, bananas can be
dried and preservedfor consumptionatany time
of the year. Amizade students interviewed farm-
ersto make sure theyunderstood the process and
that community members would worktogether

‘ to solve the banana problem.

About one—third of students inallofAmizade’s
programs hailfrom Pitt, and afew ofthemwent
to Tanzania with students from other universi-
ties. '

Blache—Cohen received his undergraduate
degree inpolitical science from Pitt before mov-

- ing to Clark University for his master’s in inter-

national development.

b Eric Hartman, executive director ofAmizade,
earned his doctorate in public and international
affairsfrom Pitt. ,

Hartman taught the class component of the
Amizade course in Tanzania. .

On a typical day in the African country, stu-
dents woke up to the sound of a rooster and had
to squat over holes in the ground to defecate,
Hartman said. ' A

After waking up, they ate breakfast before
drivingto ahouse that needed awatertank. They
spent most of the day installing it and talking to
the family that lived there.

In the evening, Hartman gave lectures on
international development and attempted to
integrate the work done during the day Blache-
Cohen said. A '

Both workinginclass and with local Tar1za_ni—
ans helped, Rahner said. She wantsto eventually
work fora nongovernmental organization deal-
ing with international development.

“We learned the history offanzania and why
it is in the situation it is right now,” Rahner said.

f‘We were able to understand much more than _

before.” _

Students saw what it’s like to live without the
luxuries that most people take for granted. For
instance, in most ruralvillages, the only source of
electricity is battery power, Blache—Cohen said.

“'Il1ere’s nothing like getting your hair cut
from a shaver attached to a car battery,” he
said. /

Trial delayed for accused bomb threat caller

Liz Navratil
News Editor

At least four times in the past four months, a
federal judge delayed setting a trial date for a
former Pitt student accused of calling in bomb
threats for two University buildings in April
2008.

Judge Nora Barry Fischer will now wait until
at least the end of August to set a trial date for
Louisa Ewuresi Nkrumah, of Harrisburg, who
is accused of calling in bomb threats for the
Cathedral of Learning and Posvar Hall.

The backstory:

Onor around April 9, someone called the
University police and threatened to use an
explosive to destroy the Cathedral of Learning.
About two days later, someone called again,
this time threatening twice to destroy Posvar
Hall.

This pastjanuary, workers in U.S. Attorney
Mary Beth Buchanan’s ofﬁce indicted Nkru-
mah for three counts of calling in threats to
“unlawfully damage or destroy a building,”
accusing her of making the calls.

July 1, thenjuly 31 and now to Aug. 31.

According to court documents, Fischer
said that she chose to extend the deadlines to
give Reed Eddy “reasonable time necessary for
effective preparation.”

Before federal judges could set a trial date
for Nkrumah, they had to give her and her
lawyer, Cynthia Reed Eddy, a chance to ﬁle
pre—trial motions. e ’ ‘ ' "

Pre—trial motions are anything that would
affect the need to have a trial or its conduct.
They can include a range of requests. In some
cases, lawyers will ask judges to exclude certain
pieces of evidence from a trial; sometimes,
they could be unrelated to a trial, such as
when a lawyer asks for an extension because
an emergency arose. ’

The motions were originally due April 15; a
judge then moved the deadline tojune 1, then

What to watch for:

If the deadlines remain intact, a judge will
set a trial date for Nkrumah shortly after the
Aug. 31 deadline to ﬁle pre—trial motions.

If Fischer extends the deadline again, Nk-
rumah’s trial date might not be set until the
end of September or later.

A new federal program allows graduates to
repay their student loans in smaller monthly
installments proportional to their income.

But because students will take longer to re-
pay — 25 years as opposed to the standard 10
. — people who participate inthe Income—based
Repayment Planwill end up paying more inthe
long run, because of interest.

payment Plan, he’s eligible forthe new Income-
based Repayment Plan.

The former 10-year plan requires loan re-
cipients to pay a ﬁxed amount until their loans
are fully paid, whereas the new income—based
planwill cancel any leitoverbalance after people
have made payments for 25 years.

The government will also forgive loans for
people who work in public service for 10 years
and make income-based payments.

The plan eases the burden on college gradu-
ates entering ﬁelds with lower incomes, includ-

ing jobs in education, government and social
work, New said.

Chatham University graduate students and
Pitt alumni Lacie Morocco and Heather McCay
sat in Hillman Library studying for a midterm
earlier this month.

9 McCay estimated that she’ll be at least
$85,000 indebtwhen she graduates, and Mo-

rocco said she plans to graduate  about

$100,000 in debt.

Though they both plan to work as physi-
cal therapists, Morocco said she can foresee

monthly loan payments getting in the way of
her goals. , "
“I am going to want things and I wantto
start a family,” she said. “I am going to go on
vacation with my family.” .
Morocco saidshe hopes to pay off her stu-

dent loans in 15 years, and McCay said she’s
frustrated by how much her education has cost
her already. I

’ “I thinkthe government needs to help people
who are goingto school forallthis time,” McCay
said, adding that she thought the government

should do even more to forgive loans than the
new Income-based Repayment Plan does.

Pittjunior Dean Matthews said he thinks the
plan will allow people to ward off credit card
debt because they’ll be able to pay their bills.
This program, he said, is essential, especially
in this economy. ' ' '

“It makes a lot of sense to me,” he said. “But
this all goes under the assumption that you’re
being responsible with your money and not

«feeding a drug habit or something.”

People using the Income-Based Repay-

ment Plan update their inforrnation armually,

' accounting for changes in income, family size,
and other information. If they don’t, they’ll be
put back on the standard 10-year plan.

There are also extended and graduated re-
payment options. ’

The extended repayment plan can be ﬁxed
or graduated, and the repayment period must
not exceed 25 years. -V I ‘ \

This plan applies to people who have re-
ceived more than $30,000 from the Federal
Family Education Loan program. The ﬁxed
amount is less than the standard plan.

The graduated repayment plan begins with
low payments, butthey increase everytwo years.
This plan is beneﬁcial for people who expect a
steady increase in pay over 10 years.

Editorial

Us,but

e’re looking forward
to the 2009-10 school
year, and we hope it’ll

be a great year for all. But how
can we make the upcoming year
even better? How can students
and the University improve?
Below are a few changes we’d
like to see this year:

Riot reform

Immediately following the
Steelers’ Super Bowl victory
Feb. 1, Oakland erupted as
crowds of subversive students
and non-students alike swarmed
the streets.

It was a hell of a night for
Steelers fans.

But for the authorities, Pitt

, officials and anyone whose

property was damaged, it was
a nightmare.

If anyone couldn’t remember
what happened the next morn-
ing, the broken glass and media
coverage provided a sobering
memory jogger. And where did
those bus stops go?

That night, rioters managed
to cause at least $40,000 worth
of damage to the University and
surrounding properties. They
also damaged our image as Pitt
students. »

By all means, students should
cheer on and support our sports
teams because Pittsburgh and
Pitt both have some of the coun-
try’s best.

But should any of them win
championships this season —
or anytime in the future —— let’s
keep the celebrations civil. If we
think we’ve established some
sort of precedent to be matched,
then we’ve learned nothing.

We owe it to our teams to
celebrate, but not to riot. This
isn’t Los Angeles, and rioting
for this reason is unfounded and
uncouth.

The Pitt News’ wish list for the 2009 school year

Power to the students

Posvar Hall — the Univer-
sity’s prominent nightlight —
needs more power. But certainly
not to power its always-lit ceiling
lights. ‘ _

Students often conﬁne their
search for study spots to areas
with electrical outlets so they
can power their laptops. Build-
ings like the Cathedral and Pos-

var Hall just weren’t designed ,

with laptop users in mind.
The second ﬂoor of Posvar

‘Hall has a mere 14 outlets for

185 seats..There are technically
more than 14, but the additional
ones are located, say, under ﬁre
extinguishers in the middle of
the hall.

They’re useless to students
in the seating areas, save those
who might happen to ‘keep an
extension cord handy.

The Cathedral doesn’t fair
much better. It’s difficult to ﬁnd
a vacant spot on the second or
third ﬂoors in one of the coveted

a ‘bigger role in the classroom
every year, Pitt needs to strive to
provide an outlet for every seat
in every classroom — and many
more in popular study spots.

Something as simple as ﬁnd-

behind.

In the long run, it could save
our community money, as text-
books and other course docu-
ments become more accessible
electronically.

Of course, there are several

be realistic — it also takes the
help of a professional.

Dorm bathrooms tend to be
the most sordid on weekends,
unsurprisingly.

Some dorm residents cel-
ebrate too much on Friday

nights, resulting in, well, vomit
in the sinks, stalls, showers and
pretty much anywhere else you

can imagine. Things aren’t much ’

prettier the next‘ night, either. ’

This means an entire'week-
end with a smelly, dirty bath-
room. And sometimes, it means

. more than ﬁnding your favorite '
shower. out of service Sunday‘

downright unsanitary.

Yes, it would cost money, but
Pitt should enlist "custodians to
clean the dorm bathroomsweek-,
round, not just Monday through
Friday.

Perhaps this would further
discourage residents from
maintaining the bathrooms,
but there’s already a high level
of indifference. Plus, it will
spare the janitors the misery of
an accumulated Monday morn-
ing mess. '

Germs don’t take off for the
weekend, and neither should our

Tone, rhetoric, smugness:

r

  

With insight onlsocialist degenerhtes, Glen Beck's eyebrows, Joe Biden jokes and more!

Molly Green
Columnist

Have you ever watched MSNBC or Fox News
and thought to yourself, “I wish I could be a
political pundit?” Perhaps it began with some-
thing as sirnple as admiringAnderson Cooper’s
majestic silver hair or that magical way Glenn
Becks raises his eyebrows. But there is a bit
of fascination surrounding those who seek to
twist the way we look at the political sphere.

Luckily, political punditry is more acces-
sible than you might originally suspect. Don’t

worry about gaining any actual knowledge of
politics —— facts are useless in this ﬁeld. Instead,

you merely must learn a few simple rules to

which nearly all television pundits adhere.

These rules will open the door to a world of
Keith Olbermanns and Sean Hannitys, aworld
of rhetoric, power suits and fancy computer-
illustrated graphics, a world of power.

The ﬁrst thing any aspiring pundit must pay
attention to is voice inflection. Voice inﬂection
is maybe the most important part of being a.
good pundit. Benign sentences like, “George W.
Bush drinks non—alcoholic beer” or “Joe Biden
likes sandwiches,” carry much more meaning
with just a simple change in tone.

"For example — to borrow a seemingly
innocuous line from a recent Bill O’Reilly col-
umn — you must speak the sentence, “The
end game here is that the Obama adrninis—
tration is badly mishandling the -health care
debate,” as if what you are actually saying is,
“The Obama administration is killing puppies
and then burying them in the White House
organic garden.” ‘

Once you have voice tone down, you can
begin to hone your pundit vocabulary. This
can be broken down into two major categories:
name-calling and jargon. Both serve vastly
different purposes, but are equally important
to establishing pundit credibility;

Name—calling is as easy as it sounds.
Remember when you were 7, and you used to
say things like, “I hate you and your face looks
like rat vomit?” Well, it’s not that different for
a political pundit. ,

For some go-to political insults, conser-

vative pundits should consider using the fol-
lowing: hippie tree huggers, anti-American,
drug—addled liberals, godless liberals, social-
ist heathen, socialist degenerates, socialists,
in general (for the record, commenting on
President Obama’s “fake” birth certificate is an
acceptable, but unimaginative choice).

Liberals, you might fancy for yourselfwords
like: fascists, war—mongers, bigots, gun—loving

3.
hicks or any pithy allusion to pop culture (e.g.
the Govemator).

Both affiliations, be sure to add in words
like “evil,” “wicked,” “crazy,” “frightening” and
“bloated” (as in, “This is the most bloated bud-
get proposal evahi”). Be sure to have fun, and
by all means, get creative with your insults.

Jargon is much more by the book. fIt’s
important to make yourself look intellectual
so thatwhen you are spouting off an argument
with absolutely no logical backing, people still
believe what you tell them. Also, the longer
the word the better. For example, you might
trade in ﬁve-letter “crazy” for nine-letter “ludi-

‘ crous.” And always remember, adverbs are your ‘

friend. Words like “indubitably,” “literally” and
“inconceivably” add no actual substance to
what you say, but they sure sound good.
-Next on the list: interrupting. This is Bill
O’Reilly’s specialty. Watch that man, and you
will learn that interrupting is an art, not a sci-
ence. Whether itbe a" Nobel Peace Prizelaure-
ate or a 15-year-old boy, if your opponent has
something valid to say,5yo_u better increase your
interruption by‘, at least 75 percent. Because

in the end, it doesn’t matter if your opinion.

is the right one, so long as you aggressively
assert that it is. L 4 - ’

Use numbers. Pundits love numbers. I had
thought about callingthis category “statistics,”

I August 25, 200.9,! The Pitt NeWs..J,.wVvW.pittneWs.corn

 toiipunditry

but then I realized, the numbers don’t actually
have to mean anything, so long as the pundit
can recite the number in an exaggerated tone
of disbelief (e.g. “And then, Vice Presidentjoe
Biden ate four sandwichesi”). For whatever rea-
son, people believe numbers. What they don’t
realize is that you, as a pundit, are attaching
an arbitrary meaning to those numbers to suit
your purposes. With some ingenuity, you can
twist any number to suit any argument.

. Last, and arguablythe hardest to ever truly
master, you must develop a condescending
chuckle or smirk. A condescending smirk or
chuckle can take the wannabe-pundit a long
way. It’s the perennial get-out-of—jail-free
card. , 7

If your opponent makes a good point and
you fail to ﬁnd any actual logic to o pose it, it’s
time to get that chuckle out of your arsenal to
divert both your opponent and your audience.
Glen Beck is probably the best condescending
chuckler in the business. He is the model of
smugness we must all seek to imitate. Beck’s

' arguments are 10 percent facts, 10 percent

rhetoric and 80 percent condescendingfacial
expressions. And hehas his own television

' show!

Pittsburgh: City of Bridges, Crosby or  Umm?

Ben Korman
Columnist

 

Living in Pittsburgh for the better part of the
past three years has taught me a great deal
about the city. I have learned that three con-
secutive weeks of 80 percent or more cloud
cover has no bearing on the mental outlook of
a community as a whole. I have learned that
bacon is a perfectly acceptable bar snack and
that you save yourselfa lot of trouble by hitting
the Heinz bottle right on the “57” seal. T

Another thing I have learned is that if you

live in Pittsburgh and you mention Pittsburgh

to someone who grew up in a city much larger
than Pittsburgh, you will be spending a lot of
your time defending the fact that Pittsburgh
is, intact, a city, and not a rural radish farming
community of some sort.

Earlier in the month, whenl mentioned to

- a co-worker — at home in New York — where

I went to school, I was not surprised when the
dude straight-up brain farted. l

“Ah, Pittsburgh,” he said. “The City of
City of umm.”

He was drawing a blank. And amid all the
suspense, I couldn’t immediately recall Pitts-

Across
Fro
Car ow

burgh’s nickname either. This didn’t particu-
larly help my attempt to aflirm the fact that
Pittsburgh is actually a city, complete with
public transportation, hookers and a nick-
name that has “City” init, and I instead poured
forth a few pithy remarks about the recent
success of the city’s professional sports teams
and something about a sanitation department
thatwas “extremely thorough and surprisingl
conscientious.” -

I later realized that “The Steel City” prob-
ably had lost me because Pittsburgh has, in
fact, lost its steel. Pittsburgh was built on the
steel trade in the 19th century, but the sector

has since given way to health care, medicine ,

and education. The city’s deindustrialization
has had a direct impact on its population
declining to nearly halfof its 1950 ﬁgure —
Pittsburgh had become so dependent on steel
that when the initial boom died down, many
workers were untrained to take on roles in
the new service—based economy. And a lot of
people moved.

So, does Pittsburgh need a new nickname?
“The Steel City” certainly seems dated.

Sure, there are the forgotten stepchildren
of Pittsburgh nicknames — “City of Bridges,”
“City of Champions,” “The ’Burgh” —— but
these are merely secondary because they lack

5

  braiding,

as anal mal<e-uispp.

    

‘ Ben Korman discusses whether nickname "The Steel City" remains applicable to Pittsburgh

precision and deeper meaning. They are the
“His Airness” or “M.].” to the more pervasive
“Airjordan.” '

I quickly put together a short list of pos-
sible revised Pittsburgh nicknames: “City
of Breakthrough Cardiology Researc ” and
“Crosbytown,” among others — and then
called up Dr. Carolyn Carson, coordinator of
Pitt’s Urban Studies program,_ just for a second
set of eyes. But before presenting my ideas, I
was curious what her list might consist of and
asked what revised nickname she’d bestow
upon Pittsburgh, apt for the next 100 years
or so.

“The Steel City,” she said. 1» .

“Still?” I responded. “Not, oh, I don’t know,
‘The City of Vaccines’ or something?”

“Steel put Pittsburgh on the map, and
people are incredibly proud of that,” said Dr.
Carson. “Even though the steel industry is
gone, the Steelers, for instance, are still very
meaningful to the people here. And a lot of
Pittsburghers today grew up with parents
who made their living in the steel trade. It’s
a tremendous source of pride.”

Could itbe? Is Pittsburgh stillThe Steel City
despite the nickname beingboth a dated moni-
ker and a relic of what’s been ﬁieling its current

g population drop? And most importantly, will

we still call Chicago “The Windy City” even’

‘ after global warming ceases all wind activ-
ity in North America? These are important ‘

questions to ponder when considering the
signiﬁcance of city nicknames.

After our conversation was over, I remem-
bered what my own nickname was for a short
while inﬁrst grade: Pogo. Some kids called me
this because I did the best in gym class one day
when we did the thing where you have to jump.
Thatwas pretty much the extent of my jumping
proﬁciency, and the nickname gradually fell
out of use as everyone became aware that my
performance was an aberration. A

Yet “Pogo” not only made me conﬁdent,
but to this day, still harkens memories of a

prosperous period in my past. ,

This is roughly approximates to the
relationship between “The Steel City” and
Pittsburgh —— a historically and emotionally
charged nickname that symbolizes growth and
thus has meaning to its internal population.
Joe New Yorker not knowingtliat Pittsburgh is
The Steel City doesn’t make the nickname any

less meaningful. It has meaning to Pittsburgh. ‘

And it’sa hell of a lot better than No. 5 on my
list: .“City of Um.” '

Attention SGB: Capitalize on your inﬂuence, for once

Jacob Brown challenges Board members to do more than padatheir resumes

Jacob Brown
Columnist

Maybe it started when the Student Government
Board began a “tradition,” as then-president
Shady Henien called it, during the 2007-08
session by spending $60,000 of our money on
ﬁberglass panthers to put around campus.

But for some reason, whenever I think of
SGB, I feel sick to my stomach.

Oftentimes, it has seemed like SGB has been
nothing more than a bunch of big egos wield-
ing around their almighty resumé—building
nonsense while really accomplishing only
the most menial of duties. Pardon my casual
observations, but I’ve been here to see it for
three years.

Typically, SGB just approves budget recom-
mendations for organizations that have already
been mulled through for hours by the steadfast
allocations committee. And they make rounds
on goodwill tours and deliberate on feel-good

issues like what to name recreational centers.

But I have a feeling that those days might
be overfor the better — and with good reason.
As someone who presided over the Panther
Wrestling Club student organization for three
years, Iwent to SGB meetings regularly, as I’ve

done since Iwas awee freshman.

Last spring, I noticed differences between
the then—new board and the one it replaced.
For the ﬁrst time in my memory, the board
members showed care and concern for their
constituents.

They started giving reasons why budgets
from various groups had been rejected dur-
ing board meetings. They allowed direct dia-
logue with people who bothered to show up
and defend their requests rather than just a
limited amount of time to say one’s piece and
have done with it.

It gives me hope that
coming into the new school

We have school budget concerns that matter
directly to us and our tuition statements. We
have a transportation system that needs to be
ﬁxed and expanded, like the terribly inefficient
Saf'eRider system.

Student-related issues outside of the con-
ﬁnes of school matter, too. Our SGB representa-
tives have the power to rally for even the most
asinine but consequential causes, like what kind
of furniture we can put on our front porches.

With enough publicity, an 18,000-under-
graduate—strong campus has the potential to
light the spark that overturns the ridiculous

providing services that would beneﬁt Oakland
residents. Often, students are taken advantage
ofby landlords because inexperienced renters
just don’t know any better.

With the initiative shown throughout last
spring and summer, SGB has already knocked

some of my skepticism away. But they have their
work cut out for them to get me to believe that
what they’re doing is ultimately better than any
of the dilly—dallying from past SGBs.

Too many times, I have read more about
board members on the now—defunctJuicy Cam-
pus website or Tucker Max’s site than I have on
the front page of the newspaper. It’s about time
that changes.

L So I propose this: Enough with the ego trips,
enough with the less-than-pragmatic wastes
of student funds on pet projects and useless
leadership development trips, and enough with
the nonsense. ‘

If student organizations are held account-
able for keeping budgets strictly within the con-
ﬁnes of their mission statements with regard to
activities, then SGB should be no different. As
per the SGB constitution, the boar¢l’s purpose is
to “promote the concerns, interests, needs and
welfare” of Pitt undergrads. That’s it.

It’s about time the catchy taglines from past
SGB campaigns like “Students First” carry some
weight behind them rather than just serve as
meaningless rally cries. I have faith that the
current SGB can deliver in a positive light like
no other board has done recently. And for all
of -our sakes, I hope they do.

Akon: storyteller, musician, American icon?

Akon might have embellished a few details about his past, but he did it with style

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

It would be wrong to say hip hop star Akon is
the most important artist of our time, because
Akon isfrom the ﬁature. He is asymbol ofwhat
it takes to triumph amid the new globalization
of pop culture. -

First, Akon is one of the primary big—time
artists to completely abandon all the scruples
we usually expect even bubblegum pop stars to
heed. Audiences thatwatch “American Idol” only

voteforcontestantswho singwell,eventhough '

the signed winners will have their voices run
through technologr that could make dolphins
sound like Otis Redding.

But with Akon, the voice on the tracks is not
so much the voice of a man called Akon as it is
the voice of a machine, and it’s blatantly obvious.
Akon just contributes the consonants thatwe still
can’t get computers to make. But no one cares.

Akon applies the vocoder idea to his per-
sonal life, too, synthesizing a concise narrative
of his past.

In his own words, Akon “did three years for
being the ringleader of a notorious car theft
operation.” He “owned four chop shops.”

While he was incarcerated, Akon started
writing songs that became popular throughout

the prison.

“That’s whenldecided musicwasbetterthan
stealing cars,” he said.

This story merits your natural incredulity. In
real life, “Akon was once arrested for receiving
stolen property and spentﬁve months inprison.
He was arrested again later for gun possession,

but only served probation. He never received
the fabled three-year term.

Akon matters culturallybecause hehasused
the media to fabricate a new persona, which
he used for wild ﬁnancial success. Nor is there
any show of ‘hiding this bait—and—switch. The
facts of the life of the man — like singing abil-
ity and criminal record — are only marginally
relevant.

Take another look at the quotation, “I did
three years for being the ringleader of a notori-
ous car theft operation.” This sounds like the
treatment for a screenplay, not the words of a
thug speaking off the cuff. Who says words like
“notorious” and “ringleader”?

C Life gave Akon lemons, and he rewrote the
script to make himself CEO of Country Time

replaced it with vocals by aMexican pop singer
named Dulce Maria and released itagainforthe
Spanish market.

Then, he did the same with Brazilian singer
Negra Li for the Portuguese market and again
with the Dutch artist, Brace, for European mar-
kets.

Akon’s music is more like a template than a
piece of art. He satisﬁes one market and then
changes the product slightly for the tastes of a
different market

But then again, we’ve seen this before.

 Aguilera made Spanish CDs. Sha-
kiramade English CDs. C

“Beautiful” matters because Akon actually
made different versions of the music video for
the different markets. The music videos are all
centered around afew images: beautifulwomen
against awhite backdrop,Akoninachairwearing
a shiny suit and Akon with the singers in front
of the white backdrop.

Everything about the video is designed for
global appeal. The beautiful women, lights
and clothes will innately wow teenagers every-
where.

The women aren’t your typical video vix-
ens, either: They’re at once ethnically diverse
and ethnically ambiguous —- everyone is going

to see at_least one of those women as natively L

beautiful. And most importantly, the white back-
drop concept makes it easy to cut and paste new

accompaniment. You just splice in Brace, Dulce
Maria or Negra Li and put each in front of this
white backdrop with Akon — that’s an hour
or two of Akon’s time for a whole new market
segment. '

It’s unusual for artists to make different ver-
sions of the music video, alongwith the remixes
for other languages.

But Akon was willing to go the extra mile
because satisfying the consumer — every pos-

, sible consumer— is whatAkon is all about. He’s

not making art — at least not in thetraditional
“inspiration — product A— let’s hope they like
it” workﬂow. He’s cutting product for markets.

In19o2,Joseph Conrad published “Heart of

Darkness” about a trip to Africa, where white ‘

' men dared go and exploit people only to exploit
themselves. In 2009, a Senegalese-American,
having conquered the U.S. market, is settinghis
sights on global economic domination.

The difference? The former is imperialism,

the latter is capitalism; the formerAkon is steal— _

ing cars, the latter is making music.

Akon, I salute your courage and insight and
wish you well. You stand for meetingpeople on
their own terms in free exchange, the power of
the long—neglected global consumers and the
promise of variety that America still holds. It
isbeautiﬁil. l -

Is it silly to start a bar ﬁght to defend the honor of chemistry?

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

The return to school always brings mixed
emotions.

On the one hand, your college friends,
activities and pleasures await you here in
Oakland. The downside is you are actually
expected to do some work, and you can’t
sunbathe on the banks of the Monongahela
for most of the school year.

Certain professors might be slightly less
than ideal, or even downright awful. Grous-
ing about teachers is deﬁnitely a pasttime of
students, and you might ﬁnd yourself com-
plaining about Dr. So-and-so.

But in times of irritation, it is helpful to
reﬂect on the difficulties of teaching.

I’ve had some limited experience on the

other side of the lectern —— as a teaching
assistant in high school and as a tutor this
summer, both times in chemistry.

This doesn’t compare to lecturing to the
last 137 years of college students, but it pro-
vides a feel for the distinct problems inherent
in turning heads full of mush into better-
educated mushy heads.

Perhaps my experience doesn’t give a feel

for instructing the mushiest head of all — my
own —- but it’s a start.

The great irony of instructing is that the
prerequisite to doing so — knowing the mate-
rial in the ﬁrst place — can be the biggest
obstacle to overcome. What is self—evident
to the teacher is completely mysterious to
students. It is therefore easy for the teacher
to assume that students knows more than
they possibly could.

Chemistry, according to popular opinion,
is a foggy subject — understandable only
by climbing the Himalaya of your choice to
reach an obscure guru, hopefully catching
a cold in the process and thereby excusing
yourself from the ﬁnal.

But that’s not how teachers of chemistry
perceive it. To them, it is perfectly obvious
why some molecules have permanent dipoles,
why some reactions proceed at faster rates if
at all and why Sn1 reactions don’t happen at
bridgehead carbons. It has also been awhile
since they were last as clueless as their stu-
dents, and it is hard to remember that.

How do you teach this obvious subject to
your Himalaya—climbing students without
belittling them? What knowledge do you
assume your audience already has? How
well do the folks in this class make connec-
tions between disparate facts? Who will have

trouble understanding what and where?

Of course, what students don’t understand
is made abundantly clear by exam time.

Tests can be just as difﬁcult on the person
grading them as they are on the person taking
them. Not only is grading a lot of work, but the
grades themselves can hurt teachers, too. You
think it’s bad getting a D on a test? How about
having to give out several of them? Indeed, the
ﬁrst set of exams I graded in high school was
downright depressing, and I wished I didn’t
have to swing the red pen as much.

When the class does poorly on a test, the
introspection begins. .

Was the test too difficult? Did the lectures
miss something? The answer might just be
that folks didn’t do their work, and your only
failing as a teacher was failing to visit‘ your
charges the week before, carrying a big stick
and forcing them to study.

. Still, a doubt remains.

The last great difﬁculty of teaching is that
some students simply do not care. This was
frequently evident when I was tutoring.

We would come to a topic I found ter-
ribly intriguing. My eyes would light up, my
heart would race. Life seemed brighter sim-
ply because I was explaining Le Chatelier’s
Principle. At just this moment, a thunderous
crescendo, my tutee would duck into the next

room to steal a glimpse at the Michaeljackson
funeral on TV.

It’s an immensely awful feeling to ﬁnd
that the subject you love is uninteresting to
some people.

Bar ﬁghts have been started for equally
disparaging remarks about somebody’s girl-
friend. Realizing that, ﬁrst, it is bad form to
hit your students and, second, that it would
be seen as silly to start a bar ﬁght to “pro—
tect the honor of-chemistry” only makes the
experience worse.

Now, I’m not saying you have to give Pro-
fessor I.M. Awful abig hu or feel that, simply
by being a student, you are at a Station of
the Cross. 7

Indeed, it is truly enjoyable to watch some-
body ﬁgure something out, and it’s a big boost
to the ego to recognize that you helped them
in that breakthrough.

The experienced teachers to whom I’ve
talked expect the challenges of instruction
and know how to deal with them. However,
just appreciate the difficulty of teaching and
note that sometimes, teaching a subject can
be just as difﬁcult as learning it for the ﬁrst
time. .

Morality has no place in the U.S. economy

Giles Howard once again battles the tyranny of the majority

Giles Howard
Columnist

President Barack Obama campaigned in 2008
on the assertion that health care is a moral right

' enjoyed by all Americans. Since his election, he

has maintained a perpetual campaign in sup-
port of universal health care and made this the
deﬁning issue of his presidency. ,
While I agree with Obama that the current
debate on health care reform is important and
will deﬁne the economic and moral ﬁiture of
our nation, I disagree with Obama on the exact
place of morals in this debate. l
Morality has no place in the U.S. economy
nor should it. The purpose of participation in
a capitalist economy is to make money and
nothing else.
Anyone who speaks about morality in eco-
nomic terms is attempting to justify the theft of
goods from the able and the productive to serve
the needs of the unable and the unproductive.
And this is essentially what Obama is attempt-
ing to do by expanding entitlements to include
health care coverage for 47 million Americans
— a number that includes the unemployed and
the illegal immigrant.
This constitutes the imposition of a mas-

sive new burden on the American worker. If a

health care reform were truly predicated on
saving the American taxpayer money, it wouldn’t
include such an expansion of entitlements but
would instead rely on mandatory catastrophic
coverage.
This would protect the taxpayer from the '

burden of caring for the uninsured in emer-

gency rooms instead of forcing the taxpayer ‘

to subsidize ﬁlll health coverage for those who
can’t afford it.

Already, the U.S.’economyisweakened by the
sub-economy of federal entitlements. Accord- '
ing to CBS News, 56.6 percent of Americans
pay the income taxes that support this entitle-
ment economy while the43.4 percent who pay
no income taxes reap the rewards of another
man’s work.

Not only is this a perversion of an economy
designed to be free, but it is unsustainable.
Today, we arewatchingthe entitlement economy
of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson
crumble under the weight of the unproductive
masses whose demands on the system costthis
nation countless jobs and revenue.

A Social Security is soon to be bankrupt, but
working Americans are yearly coerced into con-
tributingto afailed system with no ﬁiture. Bythe
admission of the Office ofManagement and Bud-
get, Medicare is rampant with fraud and waste,

yet the government seeks to extend its control
over the entire health insurance economy.

The liberal entitlement system has already
proven unsustainable, butthe bread and circuses
continueasthe Obama administration promises
millions of Americans something for nothing.

Such a socialmodel is not only untenable, it
is anunforgivable assault on the foundingvalues
of this nationthatenshrined the individualas the
highest moral authority and the governmentas
a mere guarantor of his liberty. An individual’s
ability to act in a free economy unfettered by
cumbersome government intervention is an
expression of this individual liberty.

The govemment’s ownership of an auto
manufacturer, its imposition of wage controls
on top earners and its plan to enact universal
health insurance all constitute the establish-
ment of a quasi-socialist economy where the
will of the majority trtunps the economic lib-
erty of the individual. This conflict between the
interests of the majority and the liberty of the
individual is the deciding conﬂict in the United
States today.

The federal government  been moving A

in this direction for decades, and while I am
certainly not blaming the Obama administra-
tion for its inception, the planned economy in
the service of the voting masses has become an
immediate reality.

Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, “The Ameri-
canRepublicwill endure until the day Congress
discovers that it can bribe the public with the
public’s money.” The Congress is considering

just such a bribe today.

By using the public’s tax dollars derived
largely from a productive minority to provide
services to the unproductive majority, Congress
is purchasing the support of the voting public.
The United States has realized a representative
tyranny as old as the republics of Carthage and
Rome,where the power ofpoliticians depended
on the largess they delivered to the public.

Politicians today campaign onthe porkthey
bring home to their districts, and our current
president was elected to provide services to
those who are unable or unwilling to pay for
them themselves. Perhaps in health care the
American Republic has found its ﬁnal circus
—— in which the liberty of individuals will be
buried forever under the weight of the major-
ity’s demands and the willingness of elected
individuals to meet them at all costs.

We are at the cliff’s edge and nothing but a
new commitment to the economic liberty of the
individual can rescue this great republic from
the tyranny of the majority.

Can the United States ever reallychange?

More than six months into his presidency, Obama has struggled to create the "hope" and "change" he promised

Shane Levy
Columnist

The date was Nov. 4, 2008. Try to remember
it, ifyou will. Remember where you were, who
you were with, what you were feeling. If you are
like me, elation and catharsis best describe the
pallet of emotions that swarmed over you at
ﬁrst sight of those initial projections: Barack
Obama is the president of the United States.

The 2008 presidential election had irnpli—
cations like no other election in recent U.S.
history. This was when we were going to take
back the United States of America.

Well, we certainly felt we had the man to
do it.

Obama had been constructed like no other
presidential candidate in modern U.S. history
— an almost perfect embodiment of the elusive
American Dream. His election as the United
States’ ﬁrst black president surely solidiﬁes
his role as a transcendental ﬁgure in the lore
of U.S. history.

And because of him,.the United States was
primed for a transformation into a new, pro-
gressive society not seen since the 1960 presi-
dential election. Obama was a bright, young
politician with exciting ideas and words that

energized the nation.
V Sounds like a successful model.

But over the past few months, I have been
asking myself: Do those ubiquitous words from
the Obama campaign — hope and change —
still bear the same weight and signiﬁcance they
did during campaign season?

Sure, elected ofﬁcials almost never fully
govern on their campaign promises. but this
time the American people bought it. Heck,
my columns during campaign season lauded
Obama in every regard. _

With a campaignthatrevolutionized the us
of new media technologies and a grassroots
army of volunteers, Obama certainly put forth
early signals that he was, in fact, the politician
that would usher the United States into the 21st
century and past violent partisanship. Rarely
have we seen a political campaign so industri-
ous and capable of recruiting massive volumes
of support from all walks of life.

In 2008, the idea of restoring honorto our

. proudest institutions — the Justice Depart-

ment, the military, Congress and so on — and
principles was one of the greater goals Ameri-
cans shared for this nation.

Although Obama reinstated intelligence
and critical thought to the presidency, can the
samebe said forthe rest of our institutions and
our political culture? '

To say Obama hasn’t accomplished any-
thing in his ﬁrst months in office would be
unfair.

From shifting the government’s stance
on stem—cell research to the conﬁrmation of
Sonia Sotomayor as a Supreme Court justice,
Obama has handled vital tasks since his inau-
guration.

Respectfully, however, that was to be
expected for whomever took the oath of oﬂice.
How many presidents take oﬂice with the col-
lapse of capitalism, two wars, a bloated mili-
tary budget and the task of reintroducing the
new and improved United States to the global
community? ‘

Unfortunately, each of those momentous
achievements has been met, as will future
endeavors be met, by a sharp resistance from
all areas of right—wing America.

It would have been foolish notto anticipate a
continuation of partisanpolitics inwashington
and an increase in the slanderous language
across Fox News and radio networks. But I do
not believe thatthis level of resentment for the
Obama administration and his policies could
have possibly been expected.

There’s been turmoil all right. Rush Lim-
baugh said he hoped the Obama administration
“fails.” Tea Party protests took place-in cities
across the country. Kansas physician George

Tiller, nationally known as one of the few U.S.
doctors who performed late-term abortions,
was assassinated by an anti-abortion activist.

The level of contempt demonstrated by
the right—wing of the United States has been

A an alarming development.

The transformation of the United States
that we all hoped would develop from Obama’s
election has gone horribly wrong. We went
from a nation aspiring to positively transform
our government and society into one that has
descended even ﬁl!‘tl‘l€I' into inﬂammatory and
defamatory politics.

The events that have transpired over the

A past few months have caused me, as I hope

they have caused a majority of Americans, to
reﬂect on whether this idea of change is really
possible.

Whatfrightens me is the notion thatthings
cannever change ——thatwith each new admin-

‘ istration, regardless of party, the United States

will never be able to overcome its ideological
differences and put forth policies and ideas,
that can represent the entire nation. .
Changing ourselves is not something our
elected officials cando forus. Itrequires some
deep introspection, and unfortunately, the
United States might not be ready for the task.

Children can provide insight, life lessons

Babysitting can be more valuable than just a means to some quick cash

Alie Gensheimer
Columnist

For as long as I can remember, I have always
tended to see things from a glass-half-empty
point of view.

I’ll be the ﬁrst to admit it. When anything

goes wrong, I usually describe it as “the abso— .

lute worst” and complain about my problems
to everyone I know.

Unfortunately, I have yet to shed this nega-
tivity. But this summer, after having spent
many long days babysitting, I’ve begun to
see problems in a different way: through the
eyes of children.

Every time I see a problem, kids see a solu-
tion. And they don’t just think up a solution,
they dive in headﬁrst to solve it — believing
they can fix anything with their imaginations
and their own two little hands.

One day while 1 was babysitting 11-year-
old Michael, we went outside to play fetch
with his dogs. He noticed that the bumperwas
falling off of my 1 etta on one side, nearly drag-
ging on the ground. He pointed and giggled
a little, saying, “Did you know your bumper
is falling off?” I sighed and groaned. “Yeah,
I know. It’s such a pain. I will have to take it

to get ﬁxed eventually.”

Without even responding, Michael ran
inside and came back out with a roll of silver
duct tape and started taping the bumper to
the car. “See? No problem!” he said smiling,
as he covered the entire front of my car in
tape. By the time he ﬁnished, my car looked
like it might as well have garbage bags in place
of the windows.

While he was showing off his work, an
attractive Eu ropean-lo oking man pulled into
the driveway in a sleek, black Range Rover,
and Michael’s brother, Jack, got out of the
passenger’s seat. “Hey Mateo,” Michael yelled
to the cute driver, “Alie’s bumper was falling
off so I just duct taped it a little. Doesn’t it
look great?” My face ﬂushed a severe red as
Mateo’s eyes widened in horror at my car.
He skipped the small talk after I thanked
him for bringingjack home and drove away,
leaving me embarrassed with my ridiculous
looking car. Fortunately, Michael didn’t notice
my shame. He was in his own world, patting
himself on the back for ajob well done.

This was not the only time this summer
when Michael was convinced that any pre-
dicament could be easily resolved. The day
after I bought a new car —— my sister had
the pleasure of inheriting the Jetta with the
duct taped bumper —— I drove Michael to the

swimming pool.

The parking lot was completely full, so I
decided to create my own spot. In doing so, I
backed into a ﬁre hydrant. “Sh*t! My new car!”
I yelled. The wide—eyed 11-year-old suddenly
silenced himself as his jaw dropped at my lan-
guage. Michael got out of my car to survey the
damage. “Doesn’t look too good,” he said in
his usual bubbly voice. “I’ll get some Goo Gone
on it when we get home to get the paint off.
No big deal.” Of course, he got carried away
with the G00 Gone and ended up waxing my
entire car with the greasy concoction.

The Goo Gone removed the red paint of
the ﬁre hydrant, but the damage was evident.
There was chipped paint, several long scrapes
and a dent in the back bumper. Michael
walked all the way up the long driveway and
shouted from 25 feet away, “It doesn’t look
bad at all from here.” He was beaming at his
success and proudly made his way back down
the driveway. '

The car quandaries weren’t the end of it. I
also ran into some kitchen chaos: Nine—year—
old twins Katherine and Elizabeth were help-
ing me make a birthday cake for my friend.
We went all-out with homemade cake and
frosting, for lack of anything else to do on a
cloudy summer afternoon. While our double-
layer chocolate cake baked in the oven, we

 

started on the frosting.

Elizabeth continued to add cup after cup
of powdery white substance to the bowl. After
every cup she added, I just kept saying, “It
tastes so bland, more sugar, Elizabeth, more
sugar!” It wasn’t until seven cups later that
Elizabeth said, “It’s just ﬂour, it’s not sup-
posed to be sweet.”

“Great. Looks like we wasted all that cocoa

powder,” I groaned.

“No we didn’t! I made it into Play—Doh!”
Elizabeth said, as she formed the brown mix-
ture into a dinosaur shape. Katherine and
I made new frosting while Elizabeth spent
hours creating shapes with her new edible
Play—Doh. “I’m so glad we messed up the ﬁrst
time,” laughed Elizabeth. “This is so much
fun.” .

Sometimes they’re ridiculous and some-
times they’re ridiculously innovative. But
either way, there’s humor to be found in kids’
problem solving strategies. After this sum-
mer, I am still not convinced that mess-ups
and mishaps are, well, fun. But often times,
things just aren’t as bad as they seem. All it
takes; is a little shift in perspective and, in
some ‘cases,'lots of Goo Gone and Play—Doh.

Classics: the foundation for higher education

Often disregarded in modern academia, the classics offer an interdisciplinary approach to studies

Mason Herron
Columnist

 

Many decades ago, auniversity’s curriculumwas
substantially differentfrom what it is today. Clas-
sics —— the works and languages of ancient Greece
and Rome —— provided the foundation for high
education.

But the University ofPittsburgh’s department
of classics now offers fewer than 40 classes.

  

and hours of operation may vary by location. Copyright @2007

Regrettably, Homer and Aeschylus have been
tucked away into the deepest recesses of our
university’s curriculum, hiddenfrom the majority
of undergraduates.

The term “interdisciplinary” peppers infor-
mational brochures and has become ashibboleth
for University admissions ofﬁcers. However,
classics are truly, organically interdisciplinary.
What other subjects provide an education in
rhetoric, oratory, history, poetry, philosophy,
math, biology, language, religion, politics, gov-
ernment, military science, art, architecture and

geography? These disciplines pervade a classical
education, and the beneﬁts from such an educa-
tion are inﬁnite.

Beyond that, studying the classics isn’t just
some abnormal infatuation with antiquity. It
manifests a whole way of thought. Students see
that knowledge is not simplyanamorphous fog.
And the classics can nourish the skills neces-
sary for those wishingto gain an advantage in a
turbulent job market — analyﬁcal ability, clarity
in writing and linguistic  For instance,

languages originated in the poetics of antiquity.
Studying the great works of Western civiliza-
tion— “The Odyssey,” “Oedipus Rex,” Herodo-
tus’ “Histories” or Thucydides’ “History of the
Peloponnesian War,” etc. -— provides us with
an understanding of our language, culture and
origin.

Professor Mark Possanza, chair of Pitt’s
department of classics, believes that “the decline
intihe classical educationbegan with big changes
at the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the
196os.” It’s not difﬁculttoﬁndan example ofthis:
In 1957, after the latmch of the Russian satellite,
Sputnik, the United States began avehement shift
toward education inscience and technology. As
globalization intensiﬁed and the boom in tech-
nology continued throughoutthe latter halfof the
20th century and into the 21st, the labor market
became increasingly reliant upon workers with
specialized knowledge and abilities. Forthis rea-
son, it is sensible that young undergraduates
desire nuanced and practical majors. Possanza
believes that, as a result, today’s students “think
in terms of preparation for the job market and

5 preparation for a successﬁil career.”

Numerous scholars, academics and intellec-
tuals have advocated a return to classical educa-
tion. Robert Hutchins, author of “—The University
of Utopia,” understood that, “The object of the

V educational system, taken as a whole, is not to

produce hands for industry orto teach the young
howto makealiving. Itis to produce responsible
citizens.”

Hutchings, alongwith educators suchasAllan
Bloom, Leo Strauss, Scott Buchanan, Stringfellow
Barr and  others have advocated a cur-
riculum of “great boo ,” books that promote
the great ideas of Western civilization. Only a
handﬁil of schools have created and vigorously
promoted such programs.

We should revere the astounding progress
madebywestern civilization. The greatest mech-
anism for human progress, liberal democracy,
wasplantedinGreece nearly2,5oo years ago. The
conceptual roots of ethics we still embrace are
ﬁrmlyentrenchedinthe works of Socrates, Plato
andAristotle. The stems of gran1rnar— syntax,
morphology andvocabulary—were reﬁned by
Greco-Roman grammarians. While it is foolish
to regard the tradition of Western civilization
as immaculate —— it is far from it — we must
understand and cherish those who cultivated
this culture and society we enjoy.

As debate over American education’s down-
fall continues to evolve, perhaps it is time we
re—appraise the value of the classics. This isn’t a
request that schools teach only the classics, but
they can, and should, at the very least serve as
a foundation for higher education. It might be
time to require our best and brightest at least a

samplingofwhatantiquityhas to offer. Biology, P

chemistry, psychology,'history, information sci-
ences —— students of all majors would beneﬁttre—
mendously from a mere introductory course in
the literature, history and philosophy of ancient
Western civilization.

Having had dreams? There's an app for that

Sometimes technology goes a bit too far

Ben Korman
Columnist

I had a dream that began deliciously. I was
in a bakery, surveying the options that lay
before me. There were many Danishes and
crullers in the mix, but I ended up choosing
a vanil1a—on—vanilla cupcake.

Biting into the pillow of deliciousness,
I felt something hard. It was a tiny plastic

key, perhaps detached from an equally tiny
keyboard. It was a “B.”

“B  B  for BlackBerry,” I gasped.

And lo — there, baked right into the
middle of the cupcake was a brand new
BlackBerry Bold 9000 wireless handheld
device. It was a really bigcupcake. ’

Then, I looked back behind the counter.
The bakers were BlackBerrys, too. I turned
to ask my friend if she was also seeing what I
was seeing. Yep, BlackBerrys everywhere.

Upon waking up, I realized I should
probably invest in a smartphone. As is the
case for many college students, my sum-
mer vacation means working more hours
than during theschool year. Because I’m
not paying for rent and groceries, I end up
beneﬁting from more discretionary income
with which to theoretically. purchase said
device. -

A smartphone could help me keep in
touch with my favorite Pittsburghers dur-

ing the break. It could also solve the over—
whelming boredom during my morning and

_ evening commutes. This is a path that has

chosen me, it seems.

Plus, everyone else is doing it.

A study published by technology research
ﬁrm In-Stat this past March predicts that
smartphones will double their share of the
mobile market by 2013. The president gets
one. Even my mom hasone. A smartphone-
dominated society certainly seems to be the
way things are going.

And it might even go further.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology I

has developed a prototype of a “wearable
computer” that dangles around the user’s
neck. Once fully developed, people could

' potentially frame a coffee shop with their

ﬁngers and instantly get linked to reviews
of the shop — which would be projected
into their glasses’ lenses. V

Portable devices that connect to the

Internet are poised to change how humans V

behave on an anthropological level. The
geographic distances between people,
information and other people could become
effectively negligible. It’s big stuff.

And I suspect this is why I’ve been having
disturbing’ nightmares of evil gadgets cun-
ningly disguised as delicious treats — I’ve
found myself in an unfortunate dilemma.

On one hand, I can’t wait to be able to

Facebook—friend someone while on the toi- V

let and Google Map my way around unfa-
miliar neighborhoods.

But I also like having no choice but to
look out a train window and hold civilized
arguments with people without having them

' direct their iPhone browsers to Google,

proceeding to prove me wrong and basically
make an a** out of me — hypothetically.

Counterpoint:'The Internet is pretty
much the coolest thing ever.

The rise of-smartphones has forced me
to choose between two things I love dearly:
life’s simplest pleasures and having The
Pitt News at my ﬁngertips wherever and
whenever I want it.

‘ Alas, the quandaries are overwhelming
— a cool breeze through one’s hair versus
playing Snood on the way to work, a lei-
surely meal on a park bench versus ordering
Campusfood from your BlackBerry for a
perfectly timed delivery. These are things
between which'no decent human being
should ever be forced to choose. ’ ‘

But why can’t we have both?

Well, for one, our attention spans appar-
ently can’t handle it.

Earlier this month, a British man frac-
tured his skull by running into a tree because
he was trying to tweet while jogging. This
provides a valuable lesson — as boring as
idleness can be, at least we can get some
cardio without cracking our heads open.

Technology: You might take our lives,
but you can never take our freedom!

Korman 4 68

How should I approach my inevitable
technological bondage? Should I accept it
today or maintain my innocence until I have
no choice but to give in?

Will it be real life or the Internet —
everywhere?

I don’t like having to make hard deci-
sions. When it comes to situations like these,
I prefer choosing between one thing I abso-
lutely hate and one thingl really like. I don’t

like having to choose between two things I
like. One can only hope such decisions are,
at worst, pastry-related.

Oh, how wrong I was.

From a straw poll I took with some of

restaurants to make their keep, -if they’re

internships are doing it pro bono or on a
very part-time basis.

A smoker's dilemma: quit or fund health care?

Beitzel 4 72

ever since with no problems.

Most people, though, don’t have that
80-year-old’s genes, and smoking doesn’t
just cleanly cut off some otherwise senile
years. It poisons almost every organ in the
body, unnaturally aging smokers all the way
to chronic diseases and terminal cancers.
You don’t go gentle into that good night.

So a lot of people think they can smoke
for a few years and then quit. Oh, to be a
doe—eyed youth again.

W Y H

Quitting cigarette smoking isn’t like kick-
ing heroin — who started that gross exag-
geration? — but it isn’t easy.

Smokers know they’ll end up with rusted
bodies. The skin leathers itself in atar brine.
Mouths turn to rotted wood. The throat
becomes gnarled, sometimes requiring a
surgically—implanted blowhole. If you’re
lucky enough to escape the mechanical lar—
ynx, your gruff voice will only sound clear in
comparison to the pull-start of a carbureted

lawnmower. V 5
Yet, people still light up.
‘The addiction is powerful. Harvard Uni-

: T versity studies found that cigarette -compa-

nies increased nicotine content by about
11 percent from 1997 to 2005. Those com-
panies will likely continue this practice to
retain their indentured servants —-I mean,
customers.

Most nicotine leaves the body within four
days, according to the American Cancer

Society, but furious physical and psychologi— ‘

cal factors linger. Smokers are addicts, and
addicts need to be addicted to something
——— anyone considering quitting should ﬁnd
a “healthy” addiction, like exercise or com-
petitive celery—eating.

Smoking is more than an addiction, too.
The stress relief, socialization and even a
certain counterculture allure genuinely
make it enjoyable -— nonsmokers should
understand that.

Also, quitting has its own detriments.

Your lungs and body have to purge them-
selves of the damage you’ve already done.
This sounds fantastic in theory, but reality
isn’t so rosy. It’s like having a bad cold —
coughing, aching and almost everything

i ' else listed on the NyQuil bottle — just with

salubrious effects.

You’re gettingbetter in the long term, but
feel worse in the short. A reverse logic hits
you that if you smoke again, you can make
the sickness disappear. It will, but it just
suppresses this baneful healing process.

If you quit, you’ll gain weight, lose sleep
and, suddenly, your entire world orbits per-
petually recommitting to quitting — you
might even ﬁnd yourself writing about it in
some pathetic attempt at catharsis. You’ll
want to smoke just one cigarette to regain
some sense of normalcy in your life, or at
least to stop thinking about it. Just one. Then
you spend $6 on a pack, and you’re not going
to let the other 19 cigarettes go to waste for

Herron > 82 this tough.

As desperation sets in, we can do some
things to offset our losses without resorting
to making a real-life version of “Zack and
Miri” or doing anything criminal.

Craigslist.com is "a great place to start.
If you have a truck, many people offer good
sums of money for help to move their junk. i
Some offer more for you to help move said

junk into their new houses. ‘ V '

There are also small gigs and jobs posted
onlinefor staﬂing one—time’ events. All you
have to do is show up. ‘

There is a sense of adventure in the whole
thing. What are you moving? What kind of
random event are you staffing, and what
kinds of people will you meet?

Like Forrest Gump said, “You never know
what you’re gonna get.”

Essentially an independent contractor,
you could be paired with someone who
might become a friend or someone with a
checkered pastthat lends itself to plenty of A
dinnertime conversation. '

Hey, ‘it’s all part of the fun.

While some of these examples might
sound a bit quirky, it’s important to turn
unemployment into-“funemployment.” Sure,
working odd jobs isn’t ideal, but money
obtained through less conventional means
is still, well, money. . . ’

The worst thing that can happen now
is for anyone to give up. “All that will do is
make it easier for someone else to ﬁnd a
job. If you’revthe giving type, that’s prob-
ably not a problem, but giving up doesn’t
pay the rent.

In my case, I’m going to keep working
side jobs and submitting 20 or 30 applica-
tions and resumes per week until something
clicks. I will spend my nights and week-
ends on some semi—employed journey in the
meantime. During the normal 9 to 5, I am
going to call employers until they get sick
of hearing from me. i H ' ’

it’s a little diflicult to take unemployment
sitting down. No, it’s downright miserable.

‘ But keep those spirits up. “Funemployment”
should hold you over —- monetarily and
mentally.

Just because thejob market is a little thin
doesn’t mean it’s time to go starving. Now’s
the time to dig in. -

Infomercials formulaic but put on a good show

There's never been a better time 

Keith Gillogly
Opinions Editor

 

Most people hate it when they can’t sleep.
I love it.

Well, sort of.

Long after Letterman and Leno —— ahem,
Conan — have gone to bed come the prime-
time television hours, at least for me. When
I’m still wide-eyed in those wee hours, my

eyes are glued to the television screen. My
program of choice? The infomercial.
Are you tired of resorting to late—night

sitcom reruns during those pesky sleepless

spells? Well, I’m here to tell you about the
revolutionary value of infomercials.

But what can be said about infomercials
beyond the self—explanatory, portmanteau
of “information” and “commercial?”

On the surface, they’re just gloriﬁed com-
mercials that follow a mendacious formula:
The demonstrations aren’t real. The produc-

mouth

ers-handpick the testimonials.The price is-
low and the deal seems sweet, but  the
product is ridiculous.

These were my thoughts on infomercials
for a long time, and I’m sure many consum-
ers share this distrust. Then, one restless
night a few years back, I turned on my TV.

, “Did you know you can ‘drastically
improve your reading speed and retain more
of what you read with this amazing, easy-
to-use, innovative computer program? Call
now to order!”

    
   
  
  
     
      

Normally, I’d be wary, but I guess my
sleep—deprived stupor took inﬂuence. I
picked up the phone. I soon received the
product I. ordered, and it worked well.

As a result of this successful purchase, I
had to peek at the latest infomercials if I was
still awake. At ﬁrst, I still didn’t think every
product would live up to its claims, despite
one good purchase —- at ﬁrst.

But it wasn’t long until the notepad on my
nightstand had a slew of one to 800 num-
bers etched on it. How silly I was to think
infomercials were all a sham. I blamed that
dubious assumption on sooietal upbringing.
We’re raised to loathe all forms of commer-
cials, especially lengthy ones that ultimately
ask for your credit card number.

Yet, until that night, I never gave info— '

mercials a chance. _

Alas, I knew it would be too costly to
purchase every product I wrote down. To
narrow my list, I read some pro duct reviews
online. There marked the abrupt end of my
infatuation. ‘

Suckers like me have fallen for the info-
mercial’s slick promises, but the Internet
provides a safeguard, a sobering reality
check. , ' ' .

“Total scam,” “Useless ‘piece of junk”
and other such caustic customer reviews
prevented my planned purchases. ’

It’s not as if everyone gave that handy
mini-grill I wanted a poor rating — just
80 percent of all people who bought this
product. Maybe I really would’ve used it for
every meal — assuming I like my omelets
and brownies peppered with chipped-off
Teﬂon ﬂakes. Thank you, Steve187 from

— Arizona, for that forewarning.

Herein lies the infomercial’s perpetual
ﬂaw.

Initially, it seems the infomercial pro-
vides the ultimate sales format: Producers
have an entire half—hour to convince you
to buy their glam product —— forget the TV
commercial’s ﬂeeting 30-second pitch. And
there’s no need for transient, subliminal
messages here, just a deluge of facts, testi-
monials and guarantees.

Heck, if an infomercial can’t convince
you to buy a product, what can?

Infomercials have to put forth their
utmost effort to persuade consumers.
Sure, infomercials rerun, but unlike the
commercial, they’re not there to remind
consumers every 15 minutes. Compared to
the infomercial, the monotonous barrage
of the TV commercial gets annoying, but
the repetition provides an advantage the
infomercial doesn’t have. The commercial’s
recurrence makes its jingle, its catchiness
and — if the producers did their job — its
product unforgettable. .

Yet, we grow leery when we recognize
that the infomercial tries too hard.

The glib fanfare doesn’t persuade us. It

has the opposite effect. If the product were
nearly as’ imperative to our everyday lives as
claimed, why would there be a need for such
extensive persuasion? We’ve been a con-
sumerist society for a long time. We know
when it’s too good to be true  or when it’s
ﬂat—out ridiculous, but not too ridiculous
to be true.

If that’s really the case, why is the info-
mercial industry a $100-billion industry

today? It seems every infomercial has the
unﬂagging ability to enlighten viewers to
something they’ve been unknowingly miss-
ing out on.

We’re bound to relate to at least one of
product X’s dozens of proposed uses or
ﬁnd at least one appropriate scenario for
its use.

For example, I almost bought that mini-
grill becausegl love making breakfast. And

if it makes cooking omelets that easy, sure,
I’d try it out on some dinner recipes, too.
Despite ingrained skepticism, this newfound
persuasion takes hold. Better call within the
next ﬁve minutes to maximize the deal. No
time for any online vetting.

But wait! There’s more!

I forgot to divulge the revolutionaryvalue
of infomercials. Well, actually there is none,

People are always getting upset about

Confederate ﬂags. Why do Southerners ﬂy

the stars and bars on their trucks? Today,
I’ll speak to that.

You might say I have some authority on
the subject. I was born in Virginia, moved to
Alabama when I was 6 months old and lived
there until I went off to college. My family
has been in Alabama for hundreds of years.
Several of my ancestors fought in_ the Civil
War and wore Klan robes. By any objective
measure, I’m a Southerner.

Really, though, you don’t have to be a
Southerner to grasp why people ﬂy Con-
federate ﬂags. You just have to understand
human nature.

All people want to feel novel. As much as
we try to ﬁt into the larger, blandly American
community during middle school, from high

_ school and onward we want to ﬁll a small

niche within the community.
But for certain white men, there isno
niche. A ,
We are not so much normal as we are
plain. Out of all the different white people in
the United States, we are the ones to whom
you just throw up your hands and call “white
folk.” »
This isn’t necessarily a bad situation. We
face few expectations imposed from birth.

care, a reduction in “the inﬂow of low-skill
immigrants,” elimination of guest-worker
programs, minimum wage, unionization and
dramatic ﬁnancial regulation. All of these
policies are geared toward aiding the lower
class through government intervention. His
activism has made him the champion of the
American left, and he is consistently ranked
as one of the most partisan columnists by

tual partisanship.

Liberals often cite Krugman’s Nobel
Prize as an endorsement of his ideology,
but the prize was awarded to Krugman for
“having shown the effects of economies of

‘ scale on trade patterns and on the location

of economic activity.” In other words, he
was merited for profound insights into non-
partisan economic quandary, not for his
partisan lucubration.

Krugman is undoubtedl brilliant. But
intellect alone is not always sufficient. The
problem with his ideas is that they embody a
belief in the perfectibility. of mankind —— the
belief that, with only the aid of a benevolent
government, all the ills of the world may be
remedied. He’s gone on record as claiming
that the social sciences offer “the beauty of
pushing a button to solve problems.”

Krugman spent his formative years read-

ing Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” trilogy, a ~

series of books that discusses the ﬁctional
discipline of “psychohistory.” The psycho-
historians “use their understanding of the
mathematics of society to save civilization
as the Galactic Empire collapses.” It isn’t
diﬂicult to see how such an idealistic, even
‘romantic, perspective of the sciences could
sway anybody with ambition and intelli-
gence. .

Krugman has spent nearly his entire life
ensconced in academia. He attended Yale
and MIT and has taught at UC Berkeley, the
London School of Economics, Stanford and
now Princeton. He’s been surrounded by the
most brilliant minds in the world. For this
reason, he’s developed an unhealthy distrust
of the average citizen. In one of his New York
Times columns, he revealed a belief that “it’s
neither fair nor realistic to expect ordinary
citizens to have enough medical expertise

to make life-or-death decisions about their.

own treatment.” Essentially, we’re not smart
enough to make our own decisions.

Thomas Carlyle called economics “the
dismal science.” The term is astutely accu-
rate, for economics is,‘ in its simplest form,
a means through which we attempt to deal
with the general despondency and brut-
ishness of humanity. The status quo of our
existence is poverty, and the goal of policy
is to ﬁnd the best mechanisms for creating
wealth. Often, these mechanisms involve
tough, dismal choices.

If, like Krugman, we are to assume that
the status quo is life as we currently know
it — television, air conditioning, leather
couches —— then any loss of luxury is viewed
as a tragedy. The immediate reaction is to
create a government policy that ameliorates
the suffering — a policy that, almost always,
can be best characterized as H.L. Mencken
would describe it — “neat, plausible and
wrong.”

Desperate Southerners need ﬂag for identity

Lehe < 80

musicians, he will get laughs by asking,
“What is up with white people!?”

He doesn’t mean that both ends of these
spectrums are typical -— they contradict —
but that any extreme is plausible for whites
and that this is so exclusively a white thing
you should laugh out of shock of recogni-
tion. Ha.

The sense of plainness is most acute in
the South.

Southern whites are almost all descended
from the Scots—Irish. We aren’t Polish or
Italian or Irish or any of the peoples who
have food festivals and cool stuff like that.
Our ancestors came to the United States
long ago and didn’t value record-keeping;
we have no formal cultural memory.

Wikipedia, of all places, says it best:
“Interestingly, the areas where the most
Americans reported themselves in the 2000

[U.S.] Census only as ‘American’ with no
further qualiﬁcation  are largely the areas
where many Scotch-Irish [sic] settled.”

The Scots-Irish are descended from
certain clans in lower Scotland. The clans
were so unapologetically Calvinist.and vio-
lent that they were forced to leave Scotland
for Northern Ireland and then Ireland for
Appalachia. ’

Scottish clan. That’s why the Confederate
ﬂag is a St. Andrew’s cross, like the Scot-
tish ﬂag. That’s why we drink whiskey, like
Scotch whisky. That’s why we still have a
culture of honor and hence more murder
and less property crime.

But these legacies aren’t conscious or
purposeful. We don’t realize they exist.

The result is that Southern whites live
in a novelty vacuum.

If society is a hotel, we sleep in the hall-
way —— open to everyone, but no good for
partying. There is no conversation topic
always on hand, no happy instance of soli-
darity when someone you meet shares this
meaningless-yet-somehow-worth-talking-
about characteristic, no satisfying narrative
to explain parts of yourself as “classic X.”

Our identity is the sum of our actions. We
are involuntary existentialists, and so there
is the natural anxiety, dread, angst, etc.

Unless we put Confederate ﬂags on our
trucks.

Then, thanks to a war fought 150 years
ago, we become, a priori, somebodies —
with an essence that precedes existence.
Now we have a “thing.” It is like we were
making a shirt out of a bedsheet, then some-
one gave us a sewing pattern. That pattern
is the Confederate ﬂag.

The fact that people get upset about
the Confederate ﬂag only boosts its power
to mold an identity. The ﬂag is not only
something to be defended, but it is pretty
much the only thing about a Southerner that
can be defended — nothing else is directly
under attack. It’s like how Catholicism was
more serious in Soviet Poland than in mod-
ern Poland.

The ﬂag’s apologists say the ﬂag stands

, for heritage and not racism, but many peo-

ple who ﬂy the ﬂag actually are racist.

However, please remember that the ste-.

reotypical racism came after the ﬂag’s cre-
ation. Racism is an oft-highlighted part of
Southern history. If you are trying to fashion
yourself into a “typical Southerner,” a touch

, of racism will complement your efforts.

My theory explains why white people
nationwide ﬂy the Confederate ﬂag. They
are not Southern, but they might have fam-
ily down South. So Southern is the closest

A thing toan ethnicity they have, their best

shot at novelty. .

As long as humans want to feel novel,
Southerners will keep ﬂying Confederate
ﬂags. Of course, maybe you don’t want to
live in a country where people ﬂy Confeder-
ate ﬂags, but let me remind you: My ances-
tors did not want you to live in a country
where people ﬂy Confederate ﬂags, either.
They wanted you to live to the north of that
country. ' I

periodically used to round us up and herd us
along like a line of baby ducklings — but don’t
be fooled by this happy children’s book simile.
This is an “Ugly Duckling” style line, where the
weakest duckling not only gets left behind, but is
fed to the others to increase the strength of the
rest of the “family.” I knewl had no choice but to
play my part in this cutthroat race to takeoff.

Things started off well. The car ride to the

airport went smoothly, just like we plarmed
it. Driving 60 down the highway with Elton].
playing ﬁill blast, we made it known that if any
car tried to cut us 011?‘, slow us down or pull any
other funny business, they would end up just
like Thelma and Louise — dead at the bottom
of a cliff. Luckily (for them), no one got in our
way probably because they were so intimidated
by our Plymouth minivan.

Unfortunately, the airport proved more
problematic. The check-in line for our airline
was not only full, it snaked outside the roped-
off perimeter and spilled into the general air-
port like an overﬂowing Dumpster. We were
not pleased.

“Our flight is in an hour,” rasped my little
sister, her voice like a 60-year-old chain smoker.
“I’d rather rush the crowd and force my way to
the from ”

These people clearly had no idea who they
were dealing with. My youngest sister’s ban-
shee voice was just one of many weapons in
our arsenal.

Yet for some reason, our usual form of
intimidation (empty threats) wasn’t working.
The flightwas now. in 45 minutes. According to
my dad, we had to be at least one half-hour early
justin case therewas an earthquake at security
or a ﬁre at the terminal or aliens or something
—— The Greens are prepared for anything. Action
had to be taken.

It was then that my dad, fueled by anxiety
and Morningstar Farms breakfast links, remem-

bered thatwe could check our bags outside. This ‘

realization wasan MVP moment for sure, and
I had to wonder just how many other tricks he
had tucked away in that farmy pack of his.

We sent my little sister, who trotted ﬁlll
speed like a trained army scout, to verify the
account and 10 minutes later, our bags were
checked and the people who had been in line
ahead of us, dressed inwhite_linen like the hor-
rible tourists they were, still hadn’t moved an
inch —— just like the rest of the travel-illiterate
masses. Suckers.

Now we were on our way to security and
feeling pretty good about ourselves, consid-

_ ering our latest success. Just another ant in a A
long line of insects to be crushed, we chuckled

to ourselves. V

The airport “security,” despite its attempts
to be bureaucratic and lame, proved to be of
little challenge. ‘

We separated ourselves, as trained, across
two different security guards to improve our
efficiency. Also, no one had to be strip searched,
which was also a big plus. My father did, how-
ever, have to begmdgingly surrender the board-
ingpasses forafewminutes,which, for him,was
kind of like lending us his vital organs.

“Do you still have your boarding passes?”
he asked us anxiously after we were through
security, as if we might have lost them or torn
them up in the ﬁve—minute span they were out
of his possession.

“Yes, Dad.”

“Give them to me, give them to me.”

Once the passes were safely backinthe faimy
pack and several “Let’s go, Greens!” later, we
ﬁnally reached the terminal. '

The endwas almost in sight and things were

i going great. This was even better than the Can-

ada 2005 trip, when an airport oﬂicial gave us

preferential treatment because he thoughtl was

being abused or smuggled into the country.
We celebrated this by buying ourselves cof—

fee. I downed my cup — medium, hazelnut,‘

no cream, no sugar -— in less than 10 minutes
so as to keep at the top of my game. Without
caffeine pills or 5-Hour Energy Shots, it would
have to do.

But then —— as happens in most truly great
teams (The Beatles, ’N Sync, Dubya’s cabinet),
someone got greedy. ,

“I_wantfood,” croaked the raspyvoice —-the
sound of betrayal.

“No time. Let’s go, Greens!” said my father,
clearly nonplussed by the threat of continuous
“Hannah Montana” marathons for the rest of
his days. Ithadtakenalot of ingenuity and Elton

one’s appetite was going to ruin this for him.

Polka still culturally relevant music genre for some Americans

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

OK, everybody now! Sing along if you knowthis
one: “Strike up the music, the band has begun,
the Pennsylvania Polka!” Doesn’t that sound like
an awful lot of fun?

All right, maybe it’s true that my mom tunes
into 1490 AM, WPNA, Oak Park-Chicago, every

week in time for the polka shows. 'I‘hat’s when I
leave the room. Despite that, I don’t mind polka
music (Ifthat isn’t a tepid endorsement, I don’t
know what is).

Nevertheless, it is distressing to lmow that
the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences has decided to discontinue the Grammy
Award for Best Polka Album.

The oflicial reason is that polka is not very
popular and therefore not culturally relevant
enough to deserve the exalted miniature pho-

nograph each year. ~

Onjune 4, the Associated Press said theAcad-
emy sought to keep the awards “pertinent within
the current musical landscape,” and polka no
longer ﬁt the bill.
. Now, I’m surethe Academyhas received angy
letters from polka die-hards of 80 years. I, too,
must object.

sented by polka music, especially compared to

Suffice to say, sex, drugs and accordions don’t
mix. Polka does notpromoteviolence, disrespect

Whatever else you say about it, polka is not ,

edgy-
Second, polka represents a signiﬁcant part
of the population. It is the heritage of German,

Czech and Polish descendants, as well as other '

immigrants.

Granted, manypolka songs these days are in
English, and sojourns into the “mother tongue”
canbe hilarious lessons inbadaccents for Polish-
Americans.

Thenagain, this accurately represents many
second- and third-generationAmericans ofthat
particular descent —— like, uh, me.

- Contrary to its treatment by the Grammy
committee, polka music is culturally relevant,

even if it isn’t relevantto everybodyinthe coun— '

try. As itis relevantto asigniﬁcant portion ofthe
population, it is an integral part of American
polyglot culture. I .

Polkais also aforrn of musicthatis not easily
incorporated into any other genre, whichcuts off
the argument that polka albums could simply
compete in other categories.

Traditional folk? Well, somebody’s folks lis-
ten to it.

Butwhen Peter, Paul and Mary releaseapolka
album, I’ll not only buy that album, but I’ll also
buy the feasibility of polka as folk music.

There is precedent for the recognition of
music genres that are culturally signiﬁcant if
not widely popular. On the street, one generally
does not hear Beethoven booming out of car
subwoofers, as cool as this might sound. 1

Similarly, country music is generally trashed
and bluegrass ignored, yet the Academy still
deems all three of these genres worthy of
Grammy recognition. I

Rernovingthis award mightmakesense, given
current economic circumstances. No doubtthere
is a cost to retaining an award in a particular
genre. Given thatjimmy Sturr has won 18 of
the last24Gramrnys inpolka, perhaps someone
should investigate how effective his competition
is, or whether there is simply no competition.

Indeed, this is asecondary argument usedby
the Academy. However; that notion is also a bit
dishonest. Other polka bands exist and assur-
edly release albums. It is simply the opinion of
Academy members who, while complainingthat
Sturrwins too often, give him the awardsinthe
ﬁrst place.

Ultimately, those who claim polka has no
cultural signiﬁcance needto get out ofLos Ange-
les, into the Midwest and away from thinking
Grammy-worthiness is directly related to album
sales or hipness.

t this upscale club located

in the Pittsburgh Strip

District, it’s not unusual
to spend a Saturday night with
people painted as tigers and shut
in a cage, neon body paint and
glow sticks covering the dance
ﬂoor, bras hanging from an or-
nate light ﬁxture or drag queens
decked in fabulously outlandish
attire.

And an endless supply of lol-
lipops.

‘ﬁr At Privilege Ultralounge, week
after week, attendees know that
the themed Blowpop parties do
not suck. What they might not
know is that as they dance the
night away, they play an impor-
Qnt role in Pittsburgh’s newest
wave of social activism.

Call it progress through a
dance party.

Ry-n Skyy and Phillip Royale,
the creators of the Saturday night
Blowpop party at Privilege Ul-
flﬁlounge, ushered in Pittsburgh
Pride Week in June with the city's
ﬁrst “White Party,” where people
gay and straight alike can cel--
ebrate their own brand of pride.
A party which typically calls for

It has been quite a summer.
Between blockbuster ﬂicks and
popular TV shows, from Michael

corporate the phrase “mazel tov,”

ture to talk about. And that is ex-
actly what I and a few other Pitt

Traveling to Las Vegas for a single
night of alcohol consumption and
stripper confrontation just doesn't
cut it anymore.

After "The Hangover" —— one

components of the perfect bachelor

locate him before his wedding.

The problem: None of them can
remember what happened the previ-
ous night. -

ing, the script was explicitly written
so that the audience will be as con-
fused as the ﬁlm's characters.

around the country.

The growing popularity of Pride
Fest in Pittsburgh has led Skyy to
believe “this is the time to have our
own White Party.

Because they are such a staple of .

these other big cities, they tend to
be the most nationally-recognized
events.”

Pittsburgh’s initiation to the

- White Party fraternity suggested
 a no-holds-barred entrance.

Becky Buckwild, of VH1 reality
show fame, hosted the event, and
renowned disc jockey Seth‘ Gold
provided music for the evening.

To complement the extrava-
gance of the night, a_Cirque du

1 §oleil—_esque acrobat performed

across the ceiling of the club.
It might seem like a bit much for
a party’s maiden voyage, but Skyy
has an explanation.
“[Pittsburgh’s] pride is so new.

We started in the community this a-

past year — we wanted to be part of
Pride. We can handle this because

it’s something we really want to do,”

Skyy said. “It’s all about coming
out, whether you’re gay or straight,
and celebrating who you are. Let
loose and have a good time.”

Like all Blowpop parties, the
event was open to everyone 21 and
older. Blowpop donates a portion
of its proceeds to the Delta Foun-
dation, one of Pittsburgh’s GLBT—
centered organizations.

Since setting up residence in
the city, Skyy and Royale said they
never felt like they ﬁt in anywhere
across the Pittsburgh nightlife
spectrum. They saw a distinct gap
between the gay and straight com-
munities in the city, so they decided
to do something about it.

“We started Blowpop back in
December because we weren’t

‘ happy with the status quo. We felt

like we didn’t belong in gay clubs
or straight clubs —— there wasn’t
a scene for us in Pittsburgh. We
felt something was missing, and

we wanted to ﬁll that gap. We said, ‘

‘If it’s not here now, let’s just do it
ourselves,”’ Skyy said.

The weekly party is not just a
way for Skyy and Royale to party
the way they want e their aspira-
tions expand to the mindset of the
Pittsburgh nightlife community,

in which an undeniable segrega- I

tion between the gay and straight
community exists.

“In Pittsburgh, some of the
segregation comes from this self-
imposed mentality of, ‘We have our
places to go, and they have their
places,’ and we just said, ‘Get over
it,”’ Skyy said.

Royale said he thinks of Blow-
pop as “a venue that brings all dif-
ferent types of people together.”
He doesn’t think it is exclusively
for gay or straight people — one of
his and Skyy’s goals for the party
was to bring people together and
never to limit the crowd to a single
scene or group of people.

Skyy said the response from
bar owners in Pittsburgh has been
relatively positive, with most of the
admonishment coming from own-
ers of gay bars. Other bar owners,

 goals.

“We chose ‘Blowpop’ because we wanted
a name that was really ﬁin,” Skyy said.

“And one that’s a little bit shocking,”
Royale added. “There’s some kind of con-
notation behind it. People want to ﬁnd out
what it is.” ’

“Plus, everyone loves candy,”-Skyy said.

The eccentric themes are perhaps what
sets Blowpop apart from other club parties
in Pittsburgh.

A Britney Spears-tinged “Circus” party

i included ﬁre-breathers and people in tiger-

striped body paint roaring at guests from
a cage.

At “Glow,” the black lights replaced the
disco ball and dancers emanated ﬂuorescent
radiance across the dance ﬂoor. '

But Skyy said not all themes are for pure
escapist fantasy.

themed Blowpop parties.

“Sometimes, with our themes, we can just A

be fun and off-the—wall, but sometimes we
try to make social or political statements,”
he said.

Take, for example, the “Fast Food and
Fake Boobs” party. Skyy took inspiration
from an iconic David LaChapelle photo fea-
turing Pamela Anderson and Ronald Mc-
Donald that translated into a medley of bar-
tenders dressed as waiters on roller skates
and oversized bras slung from various posts
around the club. .

Between the irreverent frivolity on display
and the guests enjoying their specially-priced
drinks, however, the subversive commentary
on American consumer culture remained.

Consider the “Garbage Patch Kids” night,
where the trash theme doubled as a ﬂip-
pant public service announcement raising
awareness about a trash heap festering in
the Paciﬁc Ocean.

With plans to expand within the next ﬁve
years, the creators said they are conﬁdent
that Blowpop will blow up, as if it hasn’t al-
ready.

They are counting on increased exposure,
attendance and respect in the community.

“We want Logo to do a reality show on
us — “The Real Queer as Folk,” maybe,”
Skyy said.

This past summer, the Blowpop parties
took a hiatus from Privelege. They will re-
sume this fall at an undecided new venue.

Budgeting and creativity the new recession trend

Samantha says this coming years biggest fashion trend will be using what you already have to save money, create new looks

Samantha Stahl
Staﬁ” Writer

Something strange happens the
slimmer before your senior year
of college. Things begin falling to-
gether as you gradually embrace
the notion of independence. Sud-
denly, the most generic advice
grows distinctly clear.

People tell you to do things
for you — no one else. People
say to study what interests you
—- not what someone else wants
you to study. People say to spend
time with those who bring out
the best in you — not waste time
V3/’1"th those who don’t. The sage
advice is about creating a sense
of self and, in this case, a sense
of style.

Regardless of your year in
school, there’s perhaps no better
time than now to ﬁnd what works
for you — and forget everything
else. Forgo spending money on
trends in favor of what makes
you look your best. Wear what
suits your personality and body

type. Wear what pleases you, and
only you. .
“There are few things in life
more pleasurable than shopping,
but there is also enormous joy to

be had from repairing and revi-

talizing,” Rita Konig, a contribu-
tor to the now—shuttered fashion
magazine Domino.

She was actually talking about

Not only is it cheaper, but you’ll
end up with your own style.
Usually, there’s nothing ‘that
thrills me more than back-to-
school shopping. ‘It brings me
back to the days in elementary
and middle school when my
mother would hand me a catalog
and a pen. I’d circle everything
I wanted, then carefully nar-

 

in favor of leggings and oversized
graphic tees — my favorites
were endangered animal styles
sold each year as an elementary
school fundraiser. -

Not much has changed since
then. This duo is still my go-to
ensemble on lazy weekends and
nights spent in the library.

furniture at the time, but it also
rings true for fashion. This year
is far less about trends and more
about putting creativity to use
and modernizing what you al-
ready own.

Dig around drawers you
haven’t opened in a while. Spend
some time shopping from your
own closet instead of the mall.

row down what I wanted badly
enough to buy.

Ironically, I- used to hate
malls. "

I associated them with tag-
ging along on my mom’s tedious
trips, searching through racks
of business suits. Those were my
tomboy days, when I rejected the

mall again. My aching bank ac-

. count has forced me to pull out

clothes I haven’t worn in years
and look at them in a new light.
If you are dying to buy some-
thing new, you’re in luck. Last
year’s high fashion trends‘ are
still trickling down into cheap—.
er chains. It’s easy to score key
pieces at affordable prices.

When composing your shop-
ping list, consider a few trends:
leather and tough detailing.
Think exposed zippers and stud-
ded anything. Layer on chain
necklaces — my favorite acces-
sory. Try a bold pair of jeans —
acid wash, distressed or brightly
colored. They’re all more versa-
tile than you might think and can
make an otherwise simple outﬁt
look more fashionable.

Hit up consignment stores
to partake in the mqnopolizing

. ’80s trend. Strong, sculptured

shoulders have generated into a
full—blown trend since Balmain’s
now notorious military jacket de-
buted last year.

Head to the stores — or your?‘
closet — and try things on. Keep’
looking until you ﬁnd things that
are perfect foryou. Put pieces
together in a way you never have.
The results might surprise you.

After all, college is a time of
trying new things and ﬁnding
yourself. - A -

So welcome back, kids. Here’s
to a fashionable year.

ilExhibit hails work of T eenie Harris

Carnegie Museum of Art celebrates work of one of Pittsburgh '3 most inﬂuential photographers and capturers of black experience

Elaine Short
Contributing Editor

An exhibit documenting the work of

iﬂﬁe of Pittsburgh’s most inﬂuential
20th-century photographers might
seem like a ﬁtting project for a major
Pittsburgh art museum, but there is
a serious obstacle to overcome: The
photographer’s negatives -— ofwhich
there are nearly 80,000 — arrived at
the museum without captions.

But with a little help from the pho-
tographer'Charles “Teenie” Harris’
family and the public, the museum
conservators said they hope to iden-
tify these photographs to archive

"/Pia" m's’ work -—— a project that began
almost one decade ago.
“Documenting Our Past: The
Teenie Harris Archive Project, Part
Three,” an exhibit at the Carnegie
Museum of Art, began its run onjuly
18 and will continue until Nov. 1 to
commemorate the celebratedwork of
one of Pittsburgh’s cultural icons.
Harris worked for one of the

United States’ once- dominant black
newspapers, the Pittsburgh Courier.

His career with the newspaper
lasted from 1936 to 1975, when Har-
ris captured historical events and the
daily lives of Western Pennsylvania’s
black population, particularly in the
Hill District ‘

Similar to the two previous Tee-
nie Harris shows, a guest curator
has selected the photographs from
Carnegie’s archives.

But Louise Lippincott, chief cu-
rator and acting co-director of the
Carnegie Museum of Art, said this
show’s curator, Charles A. “Little Tee-
nie” Harris — Harris’ son -—— brings
a personal touch to the last portion
of the project.

“One of the fascinating aspects
aboutthis exhibitionisthatthe cura-
toris the son of the artist— aperson
who knew him well, if not best,” Lip-
pincott said. “So the exhibition has
a very particular, intimate sensibil-
ity to it. There is a personal meaning
behind every photo that Little Teenie
selected.”

 Harris had been a prospect for

g Harris selected 184 photographs

Categories for the exhibit include

  

gsomething the museum wanted- to '

themes of daily life such as children,

family, occupations, social, wedding, '

historical themes such as landmarks,
celebrities, politics and protests. V

Some of the intimate photographs

life.

Other images capture ordinary
moments suchasacoal minerholding

James said “Part Three” is a“vvon-

There are a lot of slice—of-life;

events, but there are also a lot of
historical events. For instance, there

The Carnegie Mu-
seum of Art purchased
Harris’ archiveofalmost
80,000 photographic
negatives in 2001.

According to the
museum, “The archive
is considered one of

documentations of
20th-century African-
Arnerican life.” S

The National En-
dowment for the Hu— .
manities has funded Kerin Shellen-
barger, anarchivistforTeenie Harris’
work at Carnegie Museum of Art, to
catalog and digitize Harris’ -images
since 2003. 4

Of the photographs owned by the
museum, Shellenbarger, along with a

team of catalogers and imaging tech— .

nicians, has scanned and cataloged
nearly 60,000 images.

Unforttmately, because most of '

the photographs came to the muse-
um without captions, many people,

places and events pictured were left
unidentiﬁed.

“The idea has always been to
have these shows not just to exhibit
the vast amount of work that Teenie
produced,” James said, “but also in-
volve the viewers in identifying the
photographs.”

The ﬁnal step, she said, is to open
the upcomingexhibitto the public for
viewing and identiﬁcation.

The museum will present Harris’
photographs with notebooks instead
of captions, inviting the public to

Folk band proves no 'Hazard' for Pittsburgh

Fresh off of itslatest album, The Hazards of Love, The Decemberists puts on a good show

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A&E Editor

Withany great idea, there comes a
risk, of exponential growth. As was
the case with The Decemberists‘ lat-
est album The Hazards of Love.

The band’s ﬁfth album had hum-
ble beginnings with songwriter and
front man Colin Meloy planning to
write asingle songwith the same title
of a 1964 Anne Briggs EP, but as he
began to write, the one song snow-
balled into a full—blown rock opera
and the band’s ﬁfth full album.

For a hand, tied to the word “lit-
erary” and known for songs with
intricate plots of murder, love, rape,
sinking ships and Japanese folk-
lore, a rock opera seemed almost
expected.

“I don’t know if itwas inevitable,
but it makes total sense,” said De-
cemberists guitarist Chris Funk. “T/Je

Crane ll’/zfe was just three songs but
this is a huge body of work.”

The Hazards ofLove weaves the
knotty tale of a young girl, Margaret,
her shape shifting lover William and
their ill-fated romance that’s plagued

than 19,210 copies in its ﬁrst week
when it was released in March.

“I think people are cool with it.

Funk. ‘

’ The Hazards of Lave’s success
further propelled The December-
ists from college radio staples to an
emerging mainstream band with a
growing fan base.

“I think as an artist you want to
reach as many people as possible or
else you’d just stay at home. I think
we use to sort of have this Pitchfork
kind of image with tons of fans with
black glasses and black messenger
bags, so now we’re obviously really
excited to be appealing to a more
general population.”

And the band’s Aug. 14 show did
turn out a mixed crowd of old, young,
drunk and a few formally dressed
concert-goers. After two high-en-
ergy sets, the ﬁrst a run through of
The Hazards oflove and the second
a handful of crowd-pleasing songs
from its older albums, the band
ﬁnished its set witha reenactment
of the battle of Fort Pitt, inspired
by Meloy’s day trip to the Fort Pitt
Museum.

While some historical facts may
have been a bit shaky (Napoleon’s
appearance for example), The De-
cemberists showed Pittsburgh the
hazards of one damn good show.

Levinson: Lack of ‘G.l. Joe’
screenings a bad industry trend

Noah discusses how not screening a ﬁlm affects its success

Courtesy Paramount Pictures

Ninjas, soldiers and overblown blockbuster ﬁlms. Oh my!

Noah Levinson
Staﬁ' Writer

There is a problem with Hollywood sum-
mer blockbusters. They’re invading my
childhood without my permission — men-
tally and physically abusing the heroes I
once worshipped. . .

Characters like Optimus Prime and In-
dianajones are being mercilessly slaugh-
tered. Now, the predator that is Hollywood
has a new target: my G.I.Joe action ﬁgures.
And once it’s ﬁnished, I’ll never be able to
look at them the same way.

Even worse, Paramount Pictures, the
distributor of “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Co-
bra,” refused to let ﬁlm critics preview
the company’s abomination of a movie.
That’s like not letting Chris Hansen catch
a predator — it’s just wrong.

But ﬁnancially, Paramount might have
saved itself from a disappointing box-of-'
ﬁce failure — by making a disappointing

box-ofﬁce mediocrity instead.

Let’s face it. When a distributor doesn’t
allow critics to review its movie before it
comes out, the movie is expected to suck
critically.

This isn’t the first time a distributor
hasn’t permitted critics into early screen-
ings, though.

In the past year, 16 movies were re-
leased without screenings, including “Saw
V,”v“Madea Goes tojail,” “Bangkok Danger-
ous,” “Disaster Movie” (How do you know
if your life is a complete failure? You were
given a credit in “Disaster Movie.” Ba-
dum—ching!) and 12 other ﬁlms that give
me more incentive each day to viciously
stab my eyes with a rusty fork.

But “G.I.Joe” has been running circles
in the ﬁlm blog community not because
of the poorness that most ﬁlm viewers

might see, but in what the movie’s cre-.

ators saw.

Rumors ﬂew throughout the Internet,
which alleged that the director, Stephen
Sommers (“The Mummy,” “Van Helsing”),
had been ﬁred from the project.

Film blogs’ comment boards said
“leaked insider reviews” of the movie were
actually studio plants, placed in the hands
of bloggers to try to keep “G.I. Joe” from
getting trash—talked.

Overall, the movie had a nasty smell
coming from it.]ust by looking at a trailer
or poster advertisement, anyone could tell
that Paramount tried really hard to make
“G.I. Joe” look cool. ‘

‘‘G.I. Joe” was eventually released and
did fairly well in its ﬁrst weekend.

It led the box office with $56.2 million,
according to the website Rotten Tomatoes,

rees and creative writing merge in student exhibit

llRachel Hutchinson's Bracken/ridge—sp0nsored exhibit, "Four Trees, " a thought— provoking exercise

Tonyjovenitti
Staﬁ" Writer

:'"The following sentence comes from a tree:
“Every now and then, a boy would grab my
hand in comfort, but I’d just jerk away and

issolve into a pool of tears.”

It also comes from a woman dealing
ith thetrauma of being raped. The tree
 epresents this fictitious woman and,

more importantly, her hands.

Rachel Hutchinson’s Four Trees gallery,
which featured a tree in the shape of a gro-
tesque hand, raises awareness of women

. who deal with post-traumatic stress dis-

  
   

 ‘A V order. The gallery, which openedjuly 21 in

the William Pitt Union’s._Conney M. Kimbo
Art Gallery on the main floor, focused on
the stress disorder induced by sexual as-
"sault. Each tree told a different woman’s
story, ﬁguratively and literally.

The trees, which were made mostly

of duct tape, included written passages
to give the viewer an in—depth look into
what happens inside the head of a woman
suffering from the disorder. The writing,
combined with the hand-shaped tree, told
'%an emotional tale from the perspective of a
woman whose hands are puny next to her
rapist’s. The woman’s hand shakes for the
rest of her life. _

Hutchinson, an English writing major
with a ﬁction concentration, has studied
some psychology at Pitt and said she ﬁnds
the disorder unique.

“It can happen to anyone,” she said.
“It’s not directly related to genetics — you

don’t need to have grown up in a broken
home. It can come on quickly and be just as
debilitating as other mental illnesses.”

She said she decided to create an art
exhibit concentrating on the disorder

’ because she feels that sexual assault is
too often described in numbers and sta-
tistics.

“I want to bring it back to the actual
experience,” she said. “We need to go
beyond the numbers and represent the
stories behind those numbers.”

The gallery was partly inspired by a
book on the disorder — “Invisible He-
roes” by Belleruth Naparstek. In the book,
Naparstek challenges the idea that talk
therapy helps those who suffer from PTSD.
The part of the brain that controls speech
is inhibited by PTSD, and it takes more
creative methods to get to the root of the

, problem, Naparstek says.

Hutchinson’s gallery was her attempt
at those creative methods mentioned by
Naparstek. Using 40 rolls of duct tape,
she crafted four different trees.

The trees were originally supposed to
be aesthetic to the writing,lsimply to cre-
ate a “lost in the forest” ambiance. But
later, Hutchinson said, she decided to
make the trees represent the individual

women.

One represented a woman looking at
her wrinkles in the mirror, and another
told the story ofa woman trapped in her
own body after her father molested her
during puberty.

“Trees are trapped in one spot. That’s
fine for trees, but for a human, that means
they’re stuck,” Hutchinson said.

Hutchinson has never taken an art class
at Pitt, but she applied for and received a
grant through a Brackenridge Fellowship

as Vegas Stqle

elcorne Back Students 

‘project. She has worked on the exhibit
all summer with the help of her adviser,
Delaniejenkins.

“This project taught me how draining
art can be,” Hutchinson said. “Last sum-
mer, I worked full time in a warehouse,
but this summer has definitely been more
exhausting.” .

Hutchinson’s installation ran fromjuly
21-30, and Hutchinson is now taking some
time to enjoy what’s left of summer and
prepare for the coming school year.

Trees are trapped in one
spot. That's ﬁne for trees,
but for a human, that
means they're stuck.

Ricky Stein I Crazy Days

.z RICKY STEIN

Is there a new Bruce
Springsteen in town?

Maybe. Rookie
hometown hero Ricky
Stein’s debut album
reveals that he may 
just be the next cart— if
crushing blue—collar ii
hero. “

Stein’s album, Cra-
zy Days, has a sweet i"
beat, with a perfect vocal pitch to match his old-fashioned

"i‘ock style.

Passion radiates from his voice on every note. With a
musical genre label like “Americana,” he’s bound to feel
welcome among small town locals across the country.

It doesn’t matter whether he’s performing with his band
or sitting alone with just his voice and an acoustic guitar
to get through his performance. He’s got the charisma

and talent to make it a show to enjoy. ’

“Is it love or is it magic? I guess it’s one and the same,”
claims the opening chorus of Stein’s very ﬁrst song.

And this album very easily qualiﬁes as a little bit of
both with its good-old—day feel.

 

 

Race The Ghost I My First Crown

Race The Ghost is anything but quiet — its newest album, My
First Crown, is a loud, fast beat with a strong guitar leading
the band through every song that calls the album home.
The pop band might as well be a next—door neighbor
to a rock genre, because any little push would change its

deﬁnition.

This album is the result of the band’s years of musical
experience, and the time invested is evident in its eight-

track release — even
if the vocalist’s voice is
a little too high—pitched
for all non—canine ears
to tolerate.

This basically makes 
Race The Ghost a family a

The Clarks |Restless Days

Pittsburgh’s favorite hometown band, The Clarks, has done it
again with its newest album, Restless Days.

This cream—of-the-crop album is fast, upbeat and catchy,
and it has such a talented line—up that it seems as if very little
technology was used to clean its songs up.

“Restless Days” has a solid tempo that stays consistent
through the song once it begins. ‘‘

That steady tempo holds out through the entire album,
whether the lovely song is about catching the “Midnight Rose”
instead of those old trains, or whether it picks up the pace to
speed up the album. ‘

But every song doesn’t sound the same as it walks its way
through the friendships, lovers, faith, simple associations and
the strangers in one’s life.

The Pitt News Girl Talks

Editors Kieran Layton, Estelle Tran and Kelsey Shea tell their stories

_ Kieran Layton
A8-E Editor

Watching a Girl Talk concert from the audi-
ence’s perspective is an experience to be
treasured for a long time, or at least after
your muscles stop aching from the non-stop
dance party that goes on all around you for
more than an hour.

% Watching a Girl Talk concert from back-
stage is also exhilarating — seeing the fren-
zied motion and non-stop chaos from a close
pi'oximity allows one to feed off the spirit of
the crowd by sheer transfer of energy.

 But for every Girl Talk fan, the one place
yéu must assure a spot during one of Gregg

illis’ concerts is onstage, preferably right
next to Gillis and his throne of a table where
he keeps his laptop.

, This is where I spent the entirety of the

' Girl Talk set, right next to the man himself,

and I will never be able to enjoy another
concert quite the same way again.

. With the speakers pressed practically
against my cheek and the sweat from other
raucous stage dancers coating the entire
oiistage crowd, forming the equivalent of a
single sweat membrane, time lost all value.
Iistopped feeling my size~too-small boots
cutting off the circulation to my feet and I
entered musical nirvana. - I

 Without sounding too transcendental,
the energy passingjbetween everyone on—_
stage was unreal — everyone danced with
whomever they could grab, and the familiar
but eventually indistinguishable beats com-
ing from the speakers seemed to urge us to

. dance even harder, almost to the point of

b’ eaking. I _

Toward the end of the set, I stood directly A

l , to Gillis and literally soaked in his awe-

s . meness asthe sweat from his long, shaggy" '

h§iir‘specked thoseclosest to him. He turned
to me, both of us caught up in a moment I will
never fully appreciate, and I began pumping
y list in tandem with his head banging.

 Unfortunately, this resulted in my ﬁst
—It7:taking contact with Gillis’ face, but I in-
S_f3.ntly realized an -apology would have been.
futile -5 it was just another organic moment
in the set that contributes to the overall ex-
perience. ,, ’ h

e swaying, bouncing and heaving like some
living creature catered to pop mash—ups,
being onstage at the concert was almost as
good as actually being Gregg Gillis, pleasing
his thousands of ecstatic fans.

f nd myself standing in a crowd of a couple
1! ndred people yelling, “Pittsburgh’s going

to the Super Bowl!” at the top of my lungs.

No, this wasn’t a Steelers rally or a game
over at Heinz ﬁeld. It was, oddly enough, a
Girl Talk concert.

Hometown pride can come from interest-
ing places, as I realized that Friday night.
For me, it came from watching local band
after local band take the stage at the Station
Square Amphitheatre, all happy to be rocking
out in front of their own city.

With the skyline, the Point and the occa-
sional rumbling train in the background and
Greg Gillis lording over the dance party of his
own making, anyone within earshot would
have a hard time denying that it was a damn
good night to be in Pittsburgh. ' '

So while I may not quite be ready to paint
my face black and gold and pray for the pro-
tection of Ben Roethlisberger’s throwing
wrist or even‘ succumb to the awful word

“yinz,” I think it’s pretty safe to say I’m happy -

to be a Pittsburgh girl (minus the Pittsbur-
ghese and mullets, of course).

tie vived theater a boost for film, community

Hollywood Theater proves a. worthwhile project through classic movie showings and community outreach

42)»

Jared Spears
For The Pitt News

In these tough economic ﬁmes, it's not uncom-
M‘-znon to walk down the main street of one of
Pittsburgh's neighborhoods and see yet an-
other small business with a "For Sale" sign in
the window.
So when a tiny, one—screen neighborhood
movie theater announced a plan to reopen

after being closed for almost ayear, it came as
apleasant surprise for neighborhood residents
and Pittsburgh cinephiles alike.

The Hollywood Theater had been an an-
chor in the Dormont neighborhood since the
193 Os.

It ﬁrst closed in the '90s,- then reopened
brieﬂy in 2007 before succumbing to the re-
cession the following year. The windows were
boarded up and the doors were closed, but it
was not the end for the cinema.

Dormont lies south of the Pittsburgh city
line through the Liberty Tunnels. To put that
in student terms, it's a half—hour ride on the
44U from Fifth Avenue at Thackeray.

Though similar in many respects, Dormont

‘is probably not as familiar to Pitt students as

other non-Oakland areas like Squirrel Hill,
South Side or Shadyside. It was this very fact
that brought about the conception of the re-
opening.

John Maggio, president of the Dormont

Council, hopes the Hollywood Theater will
not only add to the perks of living in his com-
munity, but will also draw people from areas
all around the city. ,

"Dormont has as much to offer as any city
neighborhood," he said. "It just hasn't been
discovered yet."

That conviction, plus aﬂare for classic mov-
ies and the swank of old—time cinema, is what
drove Maggio to approach the owners of the
Hollywood Theater not as council president,
but as a private citizen.

He came up with a plan that would be both
creative and economical.Maggio's proposal
called for the theater to rqn old-time clas-
sics instead of expensive and contemporary
releases. '

The plan also included relying on local resi-
dents as volunteers instead of typical wage-
earning employees. .

The proposal was bold, but Maggio said

he believed in the commitment of his fellow '

residents to uphold the vitality of their neigh-

borhood. ‘ ’
When an open meeting was held in May,

Maggio's hope was conﬁrmed. More than 25

Dormont has as much
to offer as any city
neighborhood.

john Ma‘ 

people attended the event, and enough vol 
teers were recruited for the Hollywood Thea, 3r
to reopen. ' , ~ p— 
The premiere date is set forjuly 10., After
comingto anagreementwith Warner Brothers,
the theater has put together what Maggio cags
the "light and dark series."
The theaterwill be open every weeke  ,
with each of the ﬁrst four weekends dedicatg
to one of four classic features. _ I "’
The ﬁrst weekend will run "A Day at the
Races" -— a Marx Brothers comedy, complete
with musical numbers. , 
‘ The following weekends will feature Sco_§-
ese’s “Goodfellas,” Gene Kelley vehicle “SingiJ:5g
in the Rain” and “Rebel Without a Cause’? wiﬂl
James Dean. The theater will have only one

’.x...

' employee — a projection operator. The rest of

the staff will consist of local volunteers. ;

"I think it's important for people to r _.
up their sleeves and get involved instead; f
just talking about economic recovery," d e
volunteer said.  ‘

The volunteer, Catherine, is a college gracin-
ate who volunteers her public relations skills
by helping to design the posters and ﬂyers 4‘ ',
will advertise the reopening. “

H this worker trying to save himself.

“District 9” is directed by Neill Blomkamp
and is also backed up with producing from
Peterjackson, combining the minds of a man
who has’ worked on science-ﬁction projects
before with a highly acclaimed force in the
ﬁlm industry.

The mixture is thrilling. The ﬁlm effort-
lessly melds the action with character develop-
ment, and the importance of image and detail
with the strength of how it’s used.

The aliens look fairly believable and more

i importantly, “District 9” did not succumb to
. the challenge of making the ﬂesh-and-blood

characters less stunning than the animated.
. Stylistically, the ﬁlm begins with a very
distant documentary feeling. ' .

Its use of snapshots and fluctuations be-
tween camera styles cut from person to per-
son as each of the characters in their separate
companies and ﬁelds speak abouta certain
topic. A.

' It makes for a slow beginning, as the in-
formation needed to understand is provided
through the mixture of avdocumentary and
the crime—ﬁghting show “Cops.”

But soon enough, there is a character to love
and pity, and the change from documentary
to story is swift and clean. '

By the end, it is a touching mixture of the

two, with a tone that progressed and changed
dramatically. The audience will have sat
through heart—wrenching actions, intriguing
relationships and incredible actionscenes.
But the most fascinating aspect to watch
might not be the '
characters and in-
stead might be the
ability to create a
clash between two
societies and cul-
tures-, a clash per-
haps not very dif- g
ferent from a true
eventon Earth.
The vision of
the interaction

4 between ‘people.

and alien is pow— _

erful and convinc-

ing, more so than
most other movies
that dared to take
on the potentially
cheesy aliens—visit—
ing-Earth idea. .
Through this
interaction comes
a glimpse of things

We have and do,

deal with today.

Perhaps as audiences watch “District 9,”
they too will see the parallels between our
real history and this action—packed alterativew

Award nominations —— and this year was
no different.

Now that we’ve reached the halfway
point between the announcement of the
nominees and the Emmy Awards — the
ceremony will air Sunday, Sept. 20, on
CBS — I thought I’d share my thoughts on
the nominees and my predictions for this
year’s winners.

The general trends were not surpris-
ing. As usual, HBO dominated all other

urprises inEmmy nods

 

That was the day I lost all
faith in the Academy of
Television Arts & Sciences 

networks, reeling in an impressive 99
nominations, with NBC trailing behind
with 67. “30 Rock” earned itself the most
nominations (22) for an individual series,
with “Mad Men” tallying to a respectable
second (16). Despite these rather predict-
able stats, there were a large number of
surprises and snubs, so I will break the
nominations down by category for ease.

Outstanding Drama Series: The Acad-
emy chose to add two extra nominees to
the category this year, raising the number
from ﬁve to seven. Unfortunately for loyal
Cylon impersonators, this was still not
enough to earn cult-favorite “Battlestar
Galactica” a nomination for its ﬁnal sea-
son. Also noticeably missing were HBO’s
“True Blood” — which enjoys a large fan
base, as well as Golden Globe nods for best
drama and best actress —— and a usually
well—received “Boston Legal,” which ﬁn-
ished up its ﬁnal season lastyear.

So what did get an Academy shout out?
“Mad Men” — is anyone even remotely sur-
prised here‘? The dramatic yin to he com-

edy powerhouse yang of “30 Rock,” “Mad i V

Men” has received critical acclaim sincéits
pilot episode, not to mention earning the
Emmy for this category last year. With an
equally strong second season, sufﬁce it to
say, “Mad Men” is this year’s frontrunﬁer,
if not my personal favorite. _

If any show poses a threat to the jugger-
naut, however, its “Breaking Bad.” Person-
ally I think this show receives even more
critical acclaim than “Mad Men” —— and
rightfully so, as it possesses a sort of gritty
humanity (and humor) that I sometimes
feel polished shows like “Mad Men” lack.
However, it’s not as widely watched or

‘ known by the general public, and I fear

the buzz surrounding “Mad Men” might
be more important to voters —— seriously,
who are these people? ’—-_- than actual tele-
vision merit. ‘ ‘ if

_“Dexter” is certainly deserving of its
nomination, but not of a win, and I will
admit, I don’t watch “Big Love” or “Dam—
ages,” so I can’t in all honesty weigh in
on their chances. It°is my dearest wish
that “Lost” will win this category — its
stunning ﬁfth season is certainly deserv-
ing, with nail-biting action, smart writing

l  and incredible acting all around — but

 after four years of getting snubbed, I’m
 beginning to wonder if the distinguished
3!" members of the Academy are either just an
 evil, spiteful bunch of dream—crushers or if
 they are perhaps waiting to acknowledge
 the show’s accomplishments after its sixth

  

 and ﬁnal season, ala the Academy Award’s

E7; response to “The Lord of the Rings” tril-

 ogy. Either way, my guess is that is gets

ll‘ overlooked this year once again.

Finally, though I have immense re-
spect for Hugh Laurie’s acting talents (see:
phone—throwing incident, above), “House”
has been slowly falling into mediocrity
since its third season. In no way did its
lackluster ﬁfth season deserve a nomina-
tion over shows like “Battlestar Galactica”
and “True Blood.”

Should Win: “Lost”
Will Win: “Mad Men”

;: Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama

Series: This category is hard for me to
evaluate if only because I’ve never seen an

episode of Simon Baker’s “The Mentalist”
— though I do admire his work in “The
Devil Wears Prada” — or Gabriel Byrne’s
“In Treatment,” and I’ve heard a lot of buzz
surrounding both.

What I will say is that last year’s winner,
Bryan Cranston (“Breaking Bad”) isjustas
deserving this year. Equally strong is Jon
Hamm of “Mad Men.” Both enjoy critical
acclaim and a great deal of buzz, which
makes them instant frontrunners.

Part of me really wants Hugh Laurie
(“House”) to win this. Seriously, after
ﬁve years of outstanding acting, it’s about
freaking time. However it would be a shame
for him to win after what was perhaps the

show’s weakest season yet, and this wilt- ,

ing feeling in. my heart tells me that if he
hasn’t won yet, he might never win at all.
Oh well, he has, like, 30 Golden Globes,
anyways.

“Dexter’s” Michael C. Hall is chilling
and, somehow, entirely believable in play-
ing a sociopathic serial killer. However,
this role might be the exact thing that
hurts Hall’s chances, as his character is

Finally, and I can hardly even write it —
Holly Hunter (“Saving Grace”). I’m going
to be honest here: I hate Holly Hunter. I
always have, probably always will. And
seriously, she plays the same character
in every show or movie. Maybe I’m just
holding the atrocity that was, “Little Black
Book” against her, but she just does noth-
ing for me. Nothing.

Now for the three leading ladies I

wouldn’t mind seeing take home the 

prize:

When will you get your Emmy? Every year,
I think, “This year, Kyra will get it,” only to
be proven wrong again and again. I would
say she’d be a frontrunner this year — like
I say every year — but I’ve ceased try-
ing to apply logic to the Academy in this
matter. All I can say is, if I have to see a
disappointed .look of Kevin Bacon’s face
one more time, I might ﬂip.

As I keep reiterating, I don’t watch
“Damages,” but I’ve heard Glenn Close is
seriously scary, crazy and generally just

‘creepy. And I believe it. She is an amaz-
ing actress with a substantial resume of
experience.

And then there is Elisabeth Moss (“Mad
Men”) who really shined as the true leading
lady of one of the best shows on television.
Sorry, January Jones, but that’s my opin-
ion, and apparently the Academy agrees
with me. '

Should Win: Kyra Sedgwick

Will Win: Glenn Close or~Elisabeth ’

Moss

Outstanding Supporting Actor in all

Drama Series: I’m going to keep this brief,
because I don’t see how Michael Emerson
(“Lost”) could lose this one nor do I want
to consider it. The “Boston Legal” guys —-
William Shatner and Christian Clemenson
-— will likely spoil each other’s chances,
though Shatner’s charm works in myste-
rious way. This year also brought strong
performances from nominees William Hurt
I (“Damages”), Aaron Paul (“Breaking Bad”)
and John Slattery (“Mad Men”), but I still
say Emerson for the long—deserved win.

: Iwas both surprised and more than a little

ticked off when both the fabulous Eliza-

spite both having extremely powerful per-

that, frankly, just didn’t make sense.

“Weeds,” for example, has fallen so far
from the smart, ironic and — most of all
— human writing of the ﬁrst two seasons.

nation of “Family Guy”— just the second
animated show to achieve that honor (“The
Flinstones” was nominated in 1961). I
can’t say I’m pleased with this — what a

“South Park,” both of which are superior
animated comedies with actual plotlines.
I’ve never gotten the whole “Family Guy”

stupid and nonsensical plotlines. While it

Outstanding Lead Actress in a Com-

If she ﬁnds any competition, it will be in

most demanding character, or Christina
Applegate (“Samantha Who”), who never
ceases to deliver a quirky and lovable per-

formance. I have never quite understood
the repeated nominations for Mary Louise
Parker (“Weeds”), whose acting has never
been exceptional and, especially last sea-
son, has lost all the humanity that once
made her character somewhat redeemable

Really, does anybody
watch ‘Two and a
Half Men’?

  

awards, to my utter glee — is everything
I could want from an actor —— hilarious‘-,
lovable and the best timing of any comedic
actor on television (I think). Then the_re’s

Rainn Wilson. What is there to say about

the man who plays the indescribable
Dwight Schrute?

Despite this, “The Office” had a weak
ﬁfth season and the old “assistant to the
regional manager” shtick is starting to
tire. The “3o Rock” guys ——- Tracy Morgan
and Jack McBrayer —— stand a chance, but
could split the “3O Rock” vote. Kevin Dillon
(“Entourage”) does nothing for me, andI
can’t say much aboutjon Cryer — I don’t
watch “Two and a Half Men” (really, does
anybody watch “Two and a Half Men?”).
So NPH for the win.

Should Win: Neil Patrick Harris
Will Win: Neil Patrick Harris

Outstanding Supporting Actress in
a Comedy Series: Well, I’m happy some-
one from “Pushing Daisies” received a
nomination. And if it had to be just one
nod, Kristen Chenowith is the logical pick}
Her character has the rare, but wonderful,

_ combination of being lovable, funny and

heart-wrenching all at the same time. On
the other hand, I’m skeptical of Amy Poe-

‘hler’s nomination for her work on “Satur-

day Night Live.” Though her acting there
is strong ——- particularly her portrayal of
Hillary Clinton during the election cov-
erage —— I don’t think it as remarkable
enough for her to take home the trophy
in this category. Kristen Wiig (“Saturday
Night Live”), however, is a serious con-
tender. She is a frequent scene—stealer on
SNL and, to be perfectly honest, delivers
more laughs (at least in my opinion) than
Ms. Poehler. Jane Krakowski is not to be
overlooked and, of course, has the whole
“30 Rock”—domination thing going for
her. This connection is enough to make
her a co—frontrunner. As for Vanessa Wil-
liams (“Ugly Betty”) and Elizabeth Per-
kins (“Weeds”), they don’t stand much
of a_ chance.

Should Win: Kristen Chenowith
Will Win: Kristen Chenowith or Jane
Krakowski

‘Sweet’ new Oakland treat

A new establishment seeks to emulate Pinkberry in Pittsburgh

 

Estelle Tran
Contributing Editor

A stretch of Meyran Avenue just got a SoCal

makeover. .

The new Sweet Berry frozen yogurt shop
uses the lime green and other summery col-
ors that have garnered the Pinkberry frozen

yogurt chain so much cheery acclaim.

Though Sweet Berry might look like the
knock-off designer purse to Pinkberry’s
iconic Chanel quilted handbag, I don’t like
it any less. The frozen treat is light, sweet

-and practically guilt-free, unlike a thousand-
‘dollar purse.

, For those who are new to the "Pinkberry
‘phenomenon, which is likely because loca-
tions tend to cluster in the country’s trend
gcenters —— Southern-California and New York
_f~— the chain harks back to the Coldstone
Creamery craze. It’s not just the yogurt in
this case that brings people in the door, it’s
your choice of chocolate, fruit, sprinkles,
cereal and nuts on top that make it a custom-
ized creamy treat. -

V The yogurt comes in original and sweet-

:2 er honeydew ﬂavors. Both have a smooth
L‘ Consistency reminiscent of soft-serve ice
? cream

Sweet Berry boasts 16 toppings includ-

: ing strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, almond
 -slices, raspberries, blueberries, chocolate
i *‘chips, Fruity Pebbles and cut-up mochi —

ﬁlapanese doughy rice cake — but I only
§0unted 13.
” The yogurt is sweet enough that it stands

S 5,1033, and you don’t have to ration the good-
» ies.

Though a cohort of mine said that it

A tasted like “health,” the light taste is a big

draw to frozen nonfat yogurt, branch owner
Sung Park said.

J “It is sweeter and has less calories than
Pinkberry,” he said.

Vaughn Wallace I PHOTO EDITOR
A personalized order of the addictive Sweet Berry frozen yogurt.

But how?

“That’s our secret,” Park said proudly.

One hundred grams of theoriginal ﬂavor,
the size of an average small order, will only
weigh you down 89 calories, Fifteen grams
of sugar and 19 grams of carbohydrates. The
yogurt is naturally fat-free, too.

Park said that his shop is part of a nation-
wide franchise, but many of the stores aren’t
called “Sweet Berry.”

_ This Sweet Berry is the ﬁrst one in Penn-
sylvania, and an employee at the store said
that Park chose the location on Meyran be-
cause Oakland is the ﬁrst place that many
out- of-town college students who are famil-
iar with Pinkberry see in Pittsburgh.

In addition to frozen yogurt, Sweet Berry
offers fruit smoothies and Seattle’s Best Cof-
fee. There are only a few smoothie options
listed, but employees will happily make per-
sonal blends.

The strawberry smoothie is juice-based
and doesn’t taste as heavy or sweet as many
other smoothies We previously drank. Un-
fortunately, there is only one size, which
was roughly the same as a medium in a cof-
fee shop.

Park said that a lot of young women pre-
fer frozen yogurt as a healthier alternative
to ice cream or a specialty drink at a coffee
shop.

Considering that a small frozen yogurt
with three toppings costs $4.50, the price
is about the same.

Sweet Berry offers a delicious way to ex-
tend a date, so long as you get in the door
before 9:30 p.m. But try to plan your visit
earlier to get a larger, fresher choice of top-
pings.

The environment is clean and open, with
ﬂowers on the walls and tables. There’s seat-
ing on high chairs for about eight, but that
won’t be necessary, as you’ll probably scarf
it down before your tush hits the seat.

Pinkberry, eat your tart heart out.

Escape to theaters for cinematic ‘Getaway’

I Though it never aspires to rise above B-movie status, new thriller surprises with laughs and a smart script

Kieran Layton
A£rE Editor

.As the August days grow hotter and more
ﬂdnbearable, moviegoers ﬁnd their choices
at theaters typically limited to the dumb-
est—of-the-dumb summer blockbusters
(“G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra”) or faux—cere—
beral, audience—panderi_ng fare (“The Time

Traveler’s Wife”), when what they really

 

 

need is a total escape.

Or “A Perfect Getaway.”

Sneaking into theaters behind the
aforementioned “G.I. Joe” and another
Meryl Streep juggernaut (“Julie andjulia”),
“Getaway” is the embodiment of a near-

ﬂawless B-movie thriller. It provides high.

thrills, surprising humor and respectable
performances across the board, and be-
cause no one expects it to be’ any good, its
enjoyment factor is multiplied that much

more over the course of it’s breezy 97-
minute running time.

While much of the movie’s fun is derived
from piecing together the plot details and
ﬁguring out the mostly-predictable ending,
the story concerns three couples vacation‘-
ing or honeymooning in Hawaii as they
realize there is a killer in their midst.

_ , Which couple is the murderous one?
How have they not been caught yet? The
movie successfully involves the audience

in the whodunit, and of course, there is

g the heavily—advertised shock ending that

— while not quite as shocking as the pro-
ducers may have hoped — is nonetheless
gratifying for the viewer.

— Naturally, suspicions arise between the
couples, and red herrings are thrown the
audience’s way every 15 minutes or so to
keep things interesting. What elevates the
ﬁlm from mediocre thriller fare, however,
is the script, which is smarter than such
genre fare has any right to be. 

The ending — while it may be guess-
able minutes in ‘— ties up all the loose
ends shockingly well. Even better is the
self—referential tone the movie takes on a
third of the way through. Self—awareness
and tongue—in—cheek humor is overdone
and so often pulled off with sophomoric
effect at best, but “Getaway” proves_a_j;uc—
cessful venture- “I -z

The cast, though mostly irrelevant in
a genre ﬁlm like this, plays its roles with
a straight face, but not so straight that it
looks like it’s competing for an Oscar. 

Steve Zahn and Millajovovich are espe-
cially good, but Timothy Olyphant chews
up the scenery and script like a crackecl—out
Dakota Fanning. In the ﬁnale — after the
twist has already been revealed — Oly-
phant takes the movie into hilariously
outlandish territory with ease. Yes, the
laughs elicited during the outrageous ﬁnﬁﬁl
10 minutes are intentional, and somehow,

Co—op a chance to bring music to everyone

A new music store in Polish Hill grants easy access to music with cheap instruments and music lessons

Lauren George
For The Pitt News

jﬁseph Reichenbacher's closets are full
‘o guitars. Ten guitars, to be exact, along
with two basses, a few violins, a drum kit,
an accordion and an organ.

It's a pretty big closet.

"I like to have variety. Glockenspiels,
as well as accordions," Reichenbacher,

founder of Project 53, said.

Project 53 serves as a resource center
for all things musical. The nonproﬁt or-
ganization's mission is to provide access
to instruments and musical expertise to
anyone, regardless of .ﬁnancial circum-
stance. '

"My long—term goal is to get as many
instruments in houses as televisions," Re-
ichenbacher said. v

While Reichenbacher prepares to open
Project 53's new headquarters on Mel-

wood Avenue in Polish Hill this summer,
he continues to scour Craigslist for used
equipment and to collect donations and
instruments for consignment.

"We accept anything music-related, in
any condition," Reichenbacher said. "If we
don't know what to do with it, we'll ﬁgure
it out later." .

The gear will stock the ﬁrst of three
rooms at Project 53, which is set up as a
music store with a twist.

While the store will stock everything

one might ﬁnd in a standard music store
plus more, the strings, mandolins, banjo-
lins, kazoos and other equipment will be
available on a sliding pay scale.

"You can get anything you want at any
price, including free, but you get what you
pay for," Reichenbacher said.

For example, if a ﬂedgling violinist can't
afford a new bow, a volunteer might give
him a broken bow ﬁxed with tape, enough
to allow him to continue.practicing.

The second room, in keeping with the
goal of exposing folks to new musical ex-
periences, is an alternative school of music
with long—term plans to connect with Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon.

With a varietyof recordings from which
to listen, Reichenbacher hopes the collec-
tion will help -patrons "find what moves
you, because it's powerful stuff if you're
playing the music that moves you." 

In Project 53's third room, patrons can
hone their musical passion through prac-
tice and lessons.

A variety of music teachers, most of
them multi—instrumentalists, are avail-
able to provide private lessons. In return
for using the space for their lessons, the
teachers will give free lessons to those who
couldn't otherwise afford them.

Reichenbacher said these free lessons
will be geared toward helping people "learn
how to learn" on their own. For instance, a
teacher might answer questions and help

what you pay for.

beginners get started. They will also help
more advanced musicians get past a feel-
ing of being "stuck" to go on to the next
level.

To further foster relationships between
volunteers and students, Project 53 will
host monthly workshops that appeal to
its diverse demographic, which so far has
included anyone from toddlers and col-
lege students to professional musicians‘
and retirees. 

"The 2-year-olds get a maraca, every-
one's having a good time with music," Re-

. ichenbacher said during a previous Project

53 workshop.

At the heart of these efforts is the phi-H
losophy that music and collaboration cre-glj

Matthew Barber I Ghost Notes
Outside Music

Rocks like: Neil Young or Ryan Adams

Despite the name, Matthew Barber's new album, Ghost A

Notes, is anything but eerie —- in fact, it's one of the simplest
and most straightforward albums to come out this year.

The Canadian singer—songwriter doesn't fuss with many
extras on the album. It's just him and his guitar, and he
occasionally throws in some drums and piano. He brings
in backup vocals on tracks like "Sleep Please Come to Me"
that easily ﬁt into the album.

This results in a calm and somberly beautiful sound that
strangely contrasts with the optimism of Barber's lyrics.

,5 _ Though the simplicity of the album is the foundation
of its appeal, it's a double—edged sword. Barber doesn't do
anything too different that .
would propel Ghost Notes
to catch a great deal of at- 
tention.

But what Barber does,
he does well, which makes
the album a well concealed
gem that listeners have to
discover for themselves.

Rocks like: Jack Johnson's - hypotheticai!l‘ove“.t5hild' with.“

Summer isrollin’ in easy if you're listening to Vetiver's
new album, Tight Knit. '  .

Singer—songwriter Andy Cabic sticks to his light and
mellow acoustic style on his fourth album. His crooning
and calm voice over simple guitar sounds creates a chill
modern folk sound. But at points, Tight Knit feels more
like Cabic's solo project than a band's effort.

But despite the laid-back style, Vetiver alters its sound
from song to song and keeps the album from fading
into dismissible back— , '

switches up the tempo

Alumnus given lemons, makes band

A Los Angeles—based band refuses to bow to industry standards

Lukas Truckenbrod
«V For The Pitt News

It's 11 p.m. on Sunset Boulevard and Lem-
onwilde is backstage in the Viper Room — a
Los Angeles club epitomizing the rock 'n' roll
lifestyle that started with River Phoenix's
untimely Halloween overdose.

Lucas Martinez brushes the dust from
his vintage G & L guitar and Henry Pope
runs scales on his Music Man bass while Pitt
alumnus Ter Dines polishes his synthesizer

,.pa_ds and piano keys, gearing up for their Los

Angeles performance.
Lemonwilde seems to constantly contra-

: Edict itself into a fury of aural angst — vintage
.\ ipawnshop guitars clash with 21st century

synthesizers. But this is a conscious effort
to combat the status quo for the Sunset Strip

j ~ an alcohol- and drug-induced Mecca for
1' bands and fans .alike— is the band's home,
, and it sings honestly with unﬁltered emo-
? ‘tion. It's a continuation of a contradiction
 of the Los Angeles glam and Lemonwilde's

brute, unabashed nature.
While discussing this so-called message

A V with Pope, he suggests Lemonwilde would
.I_ not have shared the bill with such Sunset
 Strip regulars as Motley Crue or Poison 25

years ago.
Pope said the band does not play the
grandiose glam rock that once embodied

 the Strip and classiﬁed its music as "dark and
= 9,» honest," despite playing in the ideal location
; for a band on the brink of success.

"The weather is great and basically every-

. , thing you could want is here," he said.

Besides the gorgeous weather, the physi-

' Cal steel and concrete of the city has little

I_t0 do with Lemonwilde's music. The Los
Angeles denizens and the "tone and timbre"

‘ §0f the city, however, are a vital part of the

Songwriting process as well as the band's

The boys of Lemonwilde don't take themselves too seriously, unlike their stance on the
rigidity of the music industry.

on-stage performance. V

They are a classic example of a band
trying to make it -— and the music reﬂects
that. The struggle of giving up all luxuries
and even a large portion of necessities is a
consistent theme in a lot of rock music, and
Lemonwilde's work is an honest illustra-
tion of it.

Murray's vocals recall Muse's Matthew
Bellamy and the Ours'sJimmy Gnecco, while
soaring melody lines and ethereal atmo-
spheres tip the hat toward international su-
perstars like Radiohead and U2. The band's
electric keyboard grooves, especially on the
second track of its Red Room,EP -- Finding

Jesus in Math —— proves that Lemonwilde
can ﬁnd the hooks that its Los Angeles peers
need to keep up with it.

Lemonwilde, despite its battle with the
unrelenting music industry's strict ﬁlter for
what makes for popular music, has devised
a plan inspired by Radiohead and Nine Inch
Nails to get its music heard.

Pitt students who visit the band's MyS—
pace page — myspace.com/lemonwilde
—— and post a comment such as "Pitt News
knows great music" or "Pitt loves Lemon-
wilde" on the wall will be able to download
the EP at.no cost.

Free distribution of its music is a plan
to more easily and conveniently grant ac-
cess to its music to the masses, Pope said.
The Red Room EP is a superb example of
what to expect from the band that plans on
recording soon at the legendary Eastwest
studios in Hollywood, Calif., for a full—length
release.

Lemonwilde is also planning a fall tour
that will hopefully land the band in Pitts-
burgh — a ﬁtting homecoming performance
for Ter Dines. Until then, it's refreshing to
watch Pitt—grown talent ﬂourish around the
country, especially in a city as cutthroat as
Los Angeles.

Razorlight slips up with its latest release

. Matt Chmura
Senior Staff Writer

r_Grab the nearest dictionary and look up the
word “lackluster.” There should be an ac-
companying photo of Razorlight next to the
deﬁnition. .
Brit—rock groups have attempted to ﬁll the
impressive void left by the Beatles’ original
musical invasion for nearly four decades. A

multitude of bands have held the ill-omened
title of “the Next Beatles” without reaching
theplateau set by the Fab Four.

Razorlight does not even come close with
its third studio release Slipway Fires.

Following in the footsteps of notable Brit-
ish groups and Beatles—wannabes like Oasis,
Muse and the Arctic Monkeys, Razorlight has
created a name for itself with catchy indie
hooks and varied acoustic accompaniment.

While the melodies are bearable, some

even enjoyable, the overabundance of clichéd
and trite lyrics severely weigh the value of
this album down.

Take the lyrics from the song “Hostage
of Love” as an example, “You make your-
self a prisoner of me / You blind yourself so
you don’t have to see / You turn your life to a
power above / And make yourself a hostage
of love.”

The song is supposed to be about the
cruciﬁxion of Jesus Christ, but even’ with a

_In a disappointing attempt, the Brit— group '3 newest album doesn't live up to its inspirations or earlier records

 

But even with a religious

forced and shallow.

religious‘ pretext, the lines are forced and

shallow. , 
Being able to rhyme two words does not

make anyone a good songwriter. Listeners

will be hard—pressed to ﬁnd any lyrics that

, fail to illicit immediate cringes and spon-

taneous mutterings of the phrase,—“Are ou
serious?” 
Centered on former Libertines bassist
Johnny Borrell, Razorlight not only fails in
crafting original lyrics but also in the quality

" of its sound.

Borre1l’s voice sounds like a cross between
a melancholy fraternity brother strumm_ing
acoustic guitar and a disheartened Billy
Joel. . _  ;
“Wire to Wire,” the album’s ﬁrst single,
might as well have been a B—side on The
Piano Man, as Captainjackesque piano and
vocalizations ﬁll the entire song. The song
sounds all right, but it is a poor rehashing
of a classic style.

The spotty lyrics continue as Borrell
croons, “How do you love in a house without
feelings? / How do you turn what was savage
tame? / I’ve been looking for someone to¢be-
lieve in / To love me, again and again.”

Taking into account the fact that Razor-
light is offering a considerably more placid
approach from its ﬁrst two albums, there are
a few bright spots in the mellow muck.

Soft plucking of acoustic strings echoed
by a playful bass line and pattering of snares
help make “6o Thompson” one of the album’s
stand—out tracks. An atmospheric electric
guitar in the background gives the track a
distinct feel from the other offerings.

Sadly, for every “6o Thompson” present,

there are two or three unbearable mistakes to ‘

supersede the quality track. “Tabloid Lover”
is a prime example of one of these gaffs.

Exemplifying Razorlight’s often “Hey, A

those words rhyme!” lyrics and atypical in-
die sound, the song lacks originality, ﬂow and
memorability. The track might be upbeat,
but its base song structure and over—_the-top
rhyming are painful.

The lyrics are as follows, “Tabloid lover/

One-bed to another / Tabloid lover / As bad as ,

any other / Tabloid lover / Box-to-box runner
/ Got to get to cover.” .

While decent tracks are present on Slip-
way Fires, they are too seldom and too far in
between to save this attempt from falling in
the depths of mediocrity.

Despite missteps, no need for aEulogy 

,l?;ulogies' latest album delivers more of what fans enjoy, though occasionally falls flat on certain tracks

Alison Smyth -

Staff Writer

-gpu can’t like everything.

Most albums have at least one song you’ll
always skip, but just a few more can mar an
otherwise perfect compilation.

’ For Eulogies, this “bad apple syndrome”
is a clear and present danger.

The band’s second record, Here/171079177202/5,

begs the question: What could they be without
a few weak links?” ..

Eulogies brings this light, unobtrusive
poppy rock. It has allthe easy listening qual-
ity of your family-friendly TV soundtrack
band and all the presence of a grungy garage
band.

Some songs just exemplify the kind of ease

. and inherent coolness that musicians exude.

In “Bad Connection” that means a sound that’s
soft without entering rock—boy-band territory

— it’s not a folk—soft or a harsh, gravelly vocal
that plays up acoustic twangs.
the vocals come through calm and cool,
never feeling forced or overly stylized. There’s
a certain take—it—or-leave—it attitude in the
way the words roll off the tongue. There’s an
aura of cool to the laidback, yet perceptibly
content instrumentals. The band projects
this personality that drags you in because it
doesn’t demand your attention.
While songs like “Day to Day” show hap-

pily moving notes in a traditional, lighter
rock style, the low—key pieces strengthen
the album overall. “Two Can Play” brings
in female vocals‘in a duet set to light instru-
mentation. The chorus of “I implore you,”
traded between the two voices seems almost
improper for a rock band. But the word ﬁts,
taking the sparse notes and turning them
into a backdrop for an intellectually intimate
musical conversation. 2 = :

“Goodbye,” with its paced sounds, comes
"out almost robotically, but not in a futuristic
or unromantic way. The metered softness
pushes a silvery keyboard to the forefront,
which could easily be lost in a heavy instru-
mental composition. With just a pluck on the
bass and a tempo—setting drumbeat as its
guide, Eulogies’ “Goodbye” becomes a medi-
tative, calming exercise. When the track ends,
it’s like a simple, sweet “Au revoir” versus the
raucous shouted “ o” of “Dark Place.” _ I

The name of that particular track describes
the way in which it ﬁts into the album. “Dark
Place” is a dark mark on an otherwise effort-
lessly cool style. The spoken—word chorus of
voices come off as creepy and rattles off in a
way that suggests a lack of talent.

It’s all reverb and clapping, so the instru-
mentation does not save the lacklustervocals
from musical oblivion. Attempts at an alt-rock
macabre fall short, and the effortless appeal
of the other tracks fades into a screeching
rally of voices. ‘

On the last track, vocalist Peter Walker
enters solo territory. “39 Stars” has a quaky
Albert Hammond, Jr. thing going for it, with
vocals comparable to “& So It Goes,” except

if Hammond had a cold and did without the .

heavy guitar. . .

The one—man harmonies and a slightly
‘different vocal style set this solo track apart
from when Walker is singing with the band.{
Instead, vocals come out in a forced throaty
garble that makes one’s throat‘ ache in sym-
pathy. -  . V

The overall style is reminiscent of the rest
of the album and complements it, even  it
doesn’t match, but somethingstops the song
from being great or even as -good as the band
pieces. The fact that the song is largely made
up of repetitions of the phrase “39” stars in
the sky tonight,” which come out in the least

The chorus of ‘I implore _
you’ traded between the
two voices seems almost
improper for a rock band.

Snowboarder and musician invents ‘d* *one wave.

"Trouble-Andrew, a former Olympian, melds his own style of "crunk rock" into a rocking good album ‘

Matt Chmurav

Senior Staff Writer

ﬁhredding the slopes is one thing for a two-
time Olympian, but cutting your own album is
another. Trevor Andrew has done both.

The Canadian snowboarder released his
own self—titled album under his stage moniker
Trouble Andrew back in 2007. Virgin Records
picked up the atl_1lete—tumed—musician’s ﬁrst

venture, gave it a revamping and promptly
re—released it.

Combining popping electronic beats with
jamming, bass—oriented guitar riffs, Trouble
Andrew cranks out tunes comparable to the
Tony Hawk Pro Skating soundtrack.

After attending both the 1998 and 2002
Winter Olympics, with endorsements from
snowboarding powerhouses like-Burton Snow-
boards and Oakley Optics, Andrew saw himself
become one of the most recognizable athletes

in the sport.

In 2004, Andrew suffered a season—ending
injury, but he capitalized on his time off from
the slopes.

Using his absence to begin his musical
career, Andrew would recruit fellow snow-
boarders Ian Longwell,Joao Salomao, Masaru
Takaku and Johrmy Rad to help him create a
style of music he calls “crunk rock” or “d**che
wave.” in '

to M.I.A., offers her melodic phrasings to the

Slow jams are non-existent on the album..

Trouble Andrew delivers some particu-
larly witty lyrics to go with his pummeling
and pounding rhythms. Across the board, the
lyrics, delivered with Andrew’s stoner drawl,
will have listeners giggling in delight even if
he might not be trying that hard. - .

The song “Chase Money” exempliﬁes
Trouble Andrew’s meshed sound under a ca-
cophony of synthesizers and bass guitars.

Highlighting the go1d—digging nature of
girls who try to gain personal time with 
members, Andrew sarcastically questions,
“Does you’re money hug you? / Does youfref
money want you? / Does you’re money haunt
you? / What you’re money bought you?”

Trouble Andrew was like a’ snowboard
without wax. It worked but not as well as it
could. Virgin Records simply provided the
wax on this solid re-release. , __.

E the 6th Harry Potter film princely or pitifulﬁ

The A&’E editors weigh in on whether the sixth Potter film lived up to the hype

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

There might be no greater crime
against fans of a beloved literary
series than making a movie adap-

V tation that doesn’t stay faithful to

the source material.

Even more heinous to “Harry
Potter” fans, however, might be
making a ﬁlm adaptation that’s
— prepare yourself —— dreadfully
dull, without a hint of magic.

“Harry Potter and the Half-

. Blood Prince,” the sixth book and

ﬁlm in the series, never stuck out
as ‘a particularly ﬁlmable book.
There is too much penultimate
exposition leading up to the epic
seventh book, with the bulk of
the action occurring during the
majestic “Battle for Hogwarts”
in the book’s ﬁnale. .
V The movie is no different.
There is no cohesive plot to
discuss. Rather, the film feels
like a series of loosely connected

events leading up to the heart-
wrenching ending over which
fans will be sure to shed many
a tear.

This presents a challenge for
director David Yates, who trans-
lated the plot-heavy ﬁfth book on
screen two years ago.

For his second attempt at a
“Harry Potter” ﬂick, Yates suc-
ceeds in making a sumptuously
shot, pleasantly well-acted and
artfully designed ﬁlm.

What Yates fails at is establish-
ing anyvsense of pacing, but he’s
not completely to blame.

Steve Kloves’ script dwells so
much on the adolescent horni—
ness that plagues the book.

Then, as if he and Yates col-
laboratively realized the severely
saggingymiddle section of the
film, they add a scene that is al-
most completely taken from their
own imaginations.

The sceneis perfunctory,-per-
haps even appropriate, but then
Kloves really drops the ball with

‘Half—Blood Prince ’ a half-boiled snoozefest with no magic

’Kieran thinks a combination of changes from the book and uneven pacing make the newest film a bore

the ending.

What was a tense, heart-
pounding series of events in the
book,complete with an outstand-
ing battle scene with the halls of
Hogwarts crumbling around the
beloved characters, has been —

without spoiling anything — sig-
niﬁcantly altered. »

This might be a mere cry of
outrage from a die-hard “Har-
ry Potter” fanatic, but from a
narrative standpoint, so many
glossed-over subplots, simpliﬁed
explanations and blatant logical
omissions make it hard to imag-
ine that someone who hasn’t read
the book would fully grasp what’s
happening, let alone become en-
grossed in the story.

Glaring omissions aside, the
actors we have all come to know
and love tackle the inﬂux of teen-
aged hormones with grace, and
even in scenes played for cheap,
over-the-top laughs, they never

dip into tacky The CW program
territory. ’

All of the talk and snog-
ginggquickly grow wearisome,
though.

And though it might be a prod-
uct of my own mind, inﬂuenced
by the announcement of Dumble—
dore’s homosexuality, I am pretty
sure I noticed a subtle increase of
ﬂippant ﬂamboyancy to Michael
Gambon’s take on the role.

Ultimately, “Half—Blood
Prince” is not a bad ﬁlm — just
avery disappointing one.

I was outraged to see the surely
unnecessary changes, andwhen
the movie ended, it not only made
me simultaneously excited and
Wary for the seventh book adap-
tations — a two-part ﬁlm — but
it made me wish Yates had taken
more time on this installment.

If only he had created a worthy
“Half-Blood Prince” instead of a
half-boiled snoozefest.

Every supporting role performed well

The only real disappointment was Gin-

But to be fair, Wright was thrown into
a poorly written role that is just a part of
the awkward hormone-driven disaster
that is every budding relationship in the
sixth movie.

They are all rushed and often unﬁn-
ished side stories that come to a sudden
halt with Harry and Dumbledore’s ﬁnal
mission.

Despite the minor flaws in the ﬁlm,
“Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince”
is a great ﬁlm worth its weight in galle-

So anxious “Harry Potter” fans worried
about a disappointing ﬁlm can put that
particular boggart back in the closet and

expect an exciting, funny and entertaining

movie worthy of Rowling’s series.

Big Joe ’s a good option for students  

1' The newest pizzeria in Oakland will give other Atwood Street pizza places heauy competition in the coming school year

Kieran Layton
A<‘5'E Editor

Some pizzerias in Oakland ﬁnd a substantial
demographic in students searchingfor a snack
alter a long night of partying, but the newest
slice joint in Oakland prides itself on being
broader than its competition.

“We’re very family—oriented,” Dawn
Maslanka, co—owner of BigJoe’s Pizzeria &

l

Deli, said. ,

BigJoe’s tries to cater to everyone in the
broadest sense, but it does not ignore the
crucial Pitt student source of income. Simi?
lar to fellow Atwood Street establishments,
like Sorrento’s and Antoon’s, BigJoe’s offers
a discounted $5 medium cheese pizza after
midnight.

The dining space (formerly occupied by
Souf Oakland Cheesesteaks) is rather small,
with a few medium—sized tables and chairs

A large deli counter showcases various home-
made pasta salads, but the true homemade
draw at Big]oe’s lies in its pizza. Both the sauce
and dough are made fresh daily by Bigjoe him-
self, who is Maslanka’s husband and co—owner

' of the restaurant.

My regular slice of pizza was very wallet-
friendly at a mere $1.50, and the dough —
baked to a satisfying level of crispiness — com-

plemented the sweeter—than—average sauce

well. There were no unsightly grease puddles,

and my slice ensured that my future midnight

discount pizza binges would be at BigJoe’s. ,
The steak hoagie, topped with shredded

lettuce, onion, provolone cheese and some

unidentiﬁed sauce — ranch, perhaps ——~,-was
satisfying but nothing exceptional, compared
with other hoagies in Oakland. .

I also ordered garlic bread with cheese for

$1.50, and, expecting a measly slice or.two ‘

with some half—melted cheese, Iwas pleasantly
surprised to receive a large pie of dough, spiced
to perfection, with a generous portion of rnoz:
zarella,topping the dish. . '
Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to

meet Bigjoe, but I was assured I would know _

him if I saw him.
“When you walk in and you see this man, '
you know it’s Bigjoe,” Maslanka said. '

Time for a new Oakland pizzeria

Pizza combines simple ingredients for fresh taste

Big_]oe's 4 134

College students want something fast,
easy and cheap.

Iwaited a good 15 minutes for my order,
which seemed like an eternity, compared
to Antoon’s quick $5 large pizzas.

Iwas hungry for one ﬁlling slice of pizza
to keep me going for the rest of the day —
like the kind Pizza Sola makes, loaded with
tasty combinations of toppings.

2 I’ ordered a slice of the Sicilian thick
square crust pizza (only $1.50 per slice
plus 50 cents per topping. Not bad, Joe.)
and/‘an appetizer of zucchini planks ($4.25
for about six or seven planks — a bit over-
priced for a few thin slices of a cheap veg-
etable in a layer of breading, especially fo
a college student); ,5 ~

The zucchini planks were delicious —_

it’s hard to say if that yummy goodness‘
came from the individual B-ig_]oe’s prepara— ,

tion or because d-eep—f7rying anything can
‘make it taste. delicious. ' ‘

Either way, Joe’s gave me more than I’

could eat ~— satisfaction obtained.

crispy crust in my mouth.

And yet, as I inspected my lunch before
biting into a mouthful, I couldn’t help but
think back to “Pizza Days” on the elemen-
tary school lunch menu.

Four limp slices of pepperoni lay on
top of what looked like a bland slice of
microwave pizza.

The Sicilian pizza was no doubt ﬁll-
ing — the slice was about an inch thick,
and there was no skimping on sauce or
cheese.

Generosity is a commendable attribute
for any restaurant.

The homemade sauce was a little sugary,
and, while I p-refer a more zesty taste that
comes with salt rather than sugar, it was
surprisingly enjoyable all the same.

Sure, my peers and I can appreciate

quality when we see it, but when we want . V

dards are vital.

Frank Cignetti‘ [right] rejoins the Pitt football program after 20 years. Before returning
' ’ to the Panthers, Cignetti spent timein both college football and the NFL.

' Severalteams. have undergone coaching ..

‘ -OI!“-whatprograms have made moves on the

sidelines. A ,

=Football .

Offensive coordinator, replacing Matt Ca-

"vanaugh. V

Cignetti spent the 2008 season as offen-

__ sive coordinator and quarterbacks’ coach

There, he helped the Golden Bears average
33 points per game that year en route to a
9-4 record and a victory over Miami (Fla.)

Starting fullback still undetermined

Running backs ( 136

Lewis has been impressing
coaches already with his raw
athletic ability.

He can bench press 365
pounds while only weighing in

1 at 190 pounds. He has quickly

‘grasped the offense, a feat that is
usually the toughest for freshman
to achieve.

Lewis, while being only a true
freshman, enrolled at Pitt last
semester to get a jumpstart on
working out with the team, and
it’s been paying dividends.

* “I was very pleased with Dion’s
progress this spring,” Walker
said.

Walker and the coaching staff
have also been preaching several

I -key tasks that all the backs must

continue to do in order to see in-
creased game action.

“The coaches tell us to stay
focused and to know our assign-
ments,” Burns said. “If you run
a 4.2 [40-yard dash time], but
can’t run your routes and don’t
know your assignments, then that
speed doesn’t mean much.”

While three players compete
for the starting tailback position,

two others are looking to grab
the starting fullback role. Red-
shirt sophomore Henry Hynoski
and redshirt junior Kevin Collier
are battling for the fullback po-
sition.

Of the players in the backfield,
there are three backs with game
experience: Harris, Hynoski and
Collier combined for 49 rushing
yards on 17 carries last season.
Those three are all powerful run-
ners who thrive off drawing con-
tact, while Burns and Lewis are
more quick and elusive runners
— both measure in at under 6 feet
and just under 200 pounds.

Add highly touted freshman
running back Raymond Graham
from Elizabeth, N.]., and the back-
ﬁeld is even more crowded.

McCoy, Stephens—Howling and
Collins’ 1,885 combined rushing
yards and 26 touchdowns will
be almost impossible to top. But
the current running back corps is
conﬁdent that the work its been
putting in is paying off and will
help assume the void last year’s
runners left.

“The summer workouts have

been going well so far,” Burns
said. “We’re growing as a unit
and learning a lot.”

Burns said the time he spent
redshirting last season and play-
ing as the scout team running back
in practice has helped him.

“Whenever your competition
is against the ﬁrst—team defense,
you can only get better,” Burns
said.

While McCoy might have left a

tailback spot with his early depar- -

ture to the Philadelphia Eagles,
he left a lasting effect through his
work ethic that has rubbed off on
the current running backs.

“The biggest thing I took from
being around LeSean is his com-
petitiveness,” Burns said. “Not
just in football, but in whatever he
was doing, whether it be in video
games or something else.”

For Lewis to continue to stay

atop the depth chart or for one «

of the other backs to unseat him,
that type of competitiveness will
surely be on display in the upcom-
ing month as the battle at the run-
ning back position heats up.

“Just to know that we worked
hard enough for it and it paid
off in the end.”

,e;Dixon agreed.

“It was an honor to be
invited, and it— was a great ex-
perience,” he said. “I think for
the players, [the international
tournament] grew upon itself."
They become more proud of
what they were doing. They re-
aliized what they were doing. It
was something that was bigger
than themselves.”

.:i'.EFor Dixon, the hard work
started back in May when he
was named the head coach
after Davidson’s Bob McKillop
dropped out to focus on his
college team. Purdue coach

Matt Painter and Southern Illi-V

nois coach Chris Lowery joined
Dixon as assistants.

‘ .:~?Together, the three coaches
and USA Basketball invited 17
athletes — including Gibbs
and incoming Pitt freshman
Dante Taylor -— to tryout in

mid-June for the national team.

The ﬁnal 12—man roster was '
announced prior to the team’s

  

Schooioi

 Information Sciences

ibbs ‘did a reall

departure for New Zealand on
June 25.

After going undefeated in
the international tournament,
Dixon said the team found
success because the players
bought into a system that all
three coaches emphasized.

“We had three coaches who
all stressed defense,” Dixon
explained. “We had guys who
could shoot. So, we knew go— 4
ing in that we were a shooting
team and that we’d have to
defend.” .

And Dixon made sure the
players understood the phi-
losophy of strong defense and
good shooting.

“Getting that message
across was key,” he said. “Ev-
erybody played over 12 minutes
per game and nobody played
more than 22 minutes. So it
was a group of 12 guys who
were participating.”

Gibbs said he didn’t notice
a difference between Dixon’s
coaching strategy at Pitt and
the United States Under-19
tournament.

Preparing Leaders for

the Information Age

“He brought the same
things [to Team USA], and I
think I benefited from that
because we had the same prac-
tice system, practice situation,
we ran the same drills,” Gibbs
said. :'
“Throughout the whole
tournament he coached the
same way. He was defense-
oriented  I think that’s one of
the main reasons why we won
the tournament.”

The scouting report was
right, and the coaching focus

paid off. The United States was

ranked first in the tournament
with 84 3-point shots and aver-
aged 40.1 rebounds and 6:2
blocks per game.

Dixon said part of the rea-
son for success was the play
of Gibbs, who led the United
States with 203 minutes played
in the tournament.

“Coach Painter and Coach
Lowery did a lot of the substi-
tuting, and they really wanted
him in there at all times,”
Dixon said about Gibbs. “He
became our best perimeter de-

fender, and that’s what we need
from him next year at Pitt.”
Gibbs ﬁnished fourth on the
team with 9.8 points per game
while also recording seven
steals and seven rebounds in
the tournament.
Gibbs’ strong play was

a good sign for Dixon, who
expects Gibbs to make a big
impact for Pitt basketball next
season.

_ “Through all the things, I
think the most important thing
as a program [at Pitt] is that
Ashton was able to play,” Dixon
said. f‘We had a couple point
guards drop out of camp, and
he really got thrust into that
role. He did a really good job.”

That’s good news for fans
who hope to see the Panthers
return to the same postseason

‘ success they’ve enjoyed the last

few years. And if that’s going to
happen, Gibbs will need to be a
part of it — something that he
doesn’t mind doing.

“I just want to continue
playing the way I was over-
seas,” Gibbs said. “I thought

‘K.

I was playing good ball  and
I want to bring my winning

Four and hopefully a national
championship.”

For Dixon, coaching in an
international tournament
added to his coaching strategy.

“It reinforced the value
of good defense,” Dixon said
about what he’ll bring back to
Pitt basketball. “It was really
just reinforcing some things,
having good shooters, good
kids.”

Since Pitt’s roster next
season is one of the youngest
in recent years, experience at .
any level is going to help the ~ if
team. And although freshman
forward Taylor did not make
the ﬁnal roster, Gibbs said he
still feels Taylor will be ready
for next season.

“I think he learned a lot,”
Gibbs said. “He was playing
against the best players in the
country. I think he got better
overall and prepared for the
upcoming season. He’s going to
be a great player for us.”

East conference with another record-
setting mark of 12-4. 7

“Anytime you can have recognition like
that it really raises the bar. We’ve been
working really hard,” Pitt coach Agnus
Berenato said. .“My staff has been diligent
andphenomenal in knowing where we
want to go and the kind of things we want
to accomplish, and that is to try an 5._ 
in a national championship. I really thin
we are on our way.” 

Junior guard Shayla” Scott said it meant

 

‘l .1 a lot to the team to return to the Sweet 16,

but they were disappointed with the loss
to Oklahoma. _.' "
This year Pitt loses its top two scorers

from lastseason,’ Shavonte’ Zellous and

Xenia Stewart, to graduation.-Zellous aver~
aged 22.6 points per game, while Stewart
added 10.9 points per game. Both started
all 33 games for Pitt. V
“The departure of Zellousand Stewart
is huge and you justdon’t replace them,
but at the same I think .that’s the beauty
of a team,” Berenato said. “When yf,bu’re

on a team, you have other people to -step

in when you. lose somebody.”

Zellous became the first Pitt playeriever
drafted by a WNBA team when the defend-
ing champion Detroit Shock picked, her
11 overall in April. Pitt’s assistant c_§7ach
Caroline McCombs said the Panthers were
blessed to have Zellous, who displayed a
great work ethic and desire to improve

while at Pitt.
V “She wasn’t a tremendous basketball_,,

player. She was a tremendous athlete. She
really developed her skills while she was
here,” McCombs said. “As far as what it
means to our program, I’m trying to think
of words to describe it. It justshows that
you don’t have to be the best player coming
out of school or the most highly recruited.
If you work hard, anﬁhing can happen.”
Scott, who was the only other member
of the team to start every game last year,
said that Zellousand Stewart left behind
a legacy of leadership, and the skills they
showed will guide her and the rest of the
team this season as they take over leader-
ship roles. T
d “When you lose some players it just
opens up the door and the windowgfor
other players to step up,” Berenato said.
One of those leaders is point guardjania
Sims, who returns to the floor this season.
The point guard was unable to play last
year after injuring her knee and ankle in
the first game of the season and sat out the
second half the previous year because of
academic ineligibility.
“She really needs to take the leadership
responsibility and she needs to make this

Tough ﬁght expected for conference title

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt, here speaking during Pitt football media

to win our conference and go to
the BCS.”’
While it is a meaningless ac-

colade in termsof on—the-ﬁeld"

success, it shows the respect for
Pitt football. Of course, in the pre-
vious 16 years, only six times has
the preseason favorite actually
won the conference, so perhaps
its best not to be picked to win.
But hey, there’s still that smidgen
of respect.

Pitt wasn’t even the resound-
ing pick to win. The Big East does
not have one team expected to
dominate this year. It’s a wide-
open race, and the Panthers were
picked not only because they’re
the favorites, but because some
team had to be ﬁrst.

Of the 24 ﬁrst-place votes, Pitt
received eight and ﬁnished with
161 total points. West Virginia
University was picked to ﬁnish
second in the conference and re-
ceived ﬁve votes for ﬁrst and 151
points. The University of Cincin-
nati also received eight ﬁrst-place
votes, but it was picked to ﬁnish

"third overall with 144 points.

Some also think the University of
South Florida will win the confer-
ence, as it tallied three ﬁrst-place
votes and 130 points overall.

The team picked to ﬁnish ﬁfth,
Rutgers University, received 126
points in the voting, showing just
how close the top of the confer-
ence is expected to be. Wannstedt
acknowledged this as well.

“We’re one of ﬁve teams that
could win the conference if every-
thing works out right,” Wannst-
edt said. “There are four other
coaches who could be standing
here saying the same thing. So
it’s nice that we’re recognized-as
a team that has a chance to win
it, but I think the voting is an in-
dication that it could go a couple
different ways.”

While there may be parity in
the conference, the Big East is still
widely regarded as a few steps be-
low the other major conferences.
In the preseason media’s top-25
poll, no Big East team is ranked.
Pitt, West Virginia and Cincin-
nati appear toward the top of the
“others receiving votes” list, but

The top-25 poll is as follows:
ﬁve SEC teams, ﬁve Big 12 teams,
four Pac-10 teams, four ACC teams,
three MWC teams, three Big Ten
teams, one WAC team and Notre
Dame, which is not held down by
the rigors of a conference.

Even though nobody seems to
think too highly of the Big East,
the winner of the conference se-
cures an automatic bid in one of
the four BCS Bowl games.

Though national disrespect’

of the conference might make it
seem like Pitt being picked as the
favorite in the Big East is equal to
winning a superlative for friend-
liest axe-murderer or heaviest
feather, that is not the case. If
Pitt comes out of the mediocre
Big East as the winner, it will play
in one of the four biggest college
football games of the year.

And that would give the
Wannstedt—era Panthers yet an-
other ﬁrst. '"

“The entire Big East schedule is phe-

body from top to bottom, everybody is
difficult.” : --

But before Pitt starts Big East play; it

After staying home all November,-the
Panthers see their ﬁrst road game of the
year Dec. 2, when they play at Youngstown

face Western Michigan (Dec. 5) and Val-

Following the two-game home stand,
Pitt travels to take on Penn State (Dec.

Pitt concludes its out—of—conference

things’ from veterans

As Pitt's only returning starter, Sophronia Sallard has emerged as a leader on the

Women's basketball 4 142
her team,” Berenato said. “Everyone wants
a point guard to rally around, a point guard
to get them going. I believe that the point
guard is your coach on the ﬂoor.”

Sims played in all 33 games her fresh-
man season, starting in 29 after former
point guard Mallorie Winn missed most

ofthe year with a knee injury. She was de-

clared academically ineligible the second
half of her sophomore season.

Having a healthy Sims isn’t the only
aspect of Pitt’s lineup that will change
next year. A few Panthers are moving to
new positions on the court. One of those
Players is Scott, who Berenato and Mc-
Coinbs said would try to take on a role as
more a wing player nexttseason.

“She’s a great player facing the basket.
She?s able to take it tothe basket, she’s able
to pull up as well as penetrate and score,”
Berenato said. “Last year, she did what we
needed her to do and that was to play in
the post position.”

To prepare for the adjustment, Scott
said she concentrated on her shot this
Summer. The team worked‘ together this
Summer, as well, said Scott, as the Panthers
areﬁclose on and off the court. Berenato
said that summer work-outs are crucial to
Pitt’s success, because they increase the
team’s mental and physical strength.

-Another player moving positions is
S°Pl1ronia Sallard, who played point guard
fol‘ the Panthers last year. Berenato said
that with Sims returning, Sallard can

play her natural two and three guard po-
sitions.

Sallard is Pitt’s only returning senior,
and McCombs said that the junior class,
consisting of Scott, Chelsea Cole, Taneisha
Harrison and Selena Nwude is ready to
emerge for the Panthers.

“They are juniors now, they’re upper-
classmen now, and the bulk of the team is
going to be resting on their shoulders, so
we’re looking for big things from them,”
Berenato said. V

Along with Scott, the Panthers return
four players who started games last sea-
son. Sallard played in every game and
started 19. Harrison started 13 games,
while sophomore center Shawnice “Pep—
per” Wilson started 32 games, including all
16 conference games. She played in every
game last season. Sophomore center Kate
Popovec was the only other Panther to
start last year, starting in just one game.

Despite losing Zellous and Stewart, the ' '

Panthers return a solid core. The experi-
enced Scott and Harrison willjoin Sims
in the backcourt, while Wilson looks to
improve from a solid freshman season
to dominate inside force. Sallard, listed
as a guard and forward, will provide se-
nior leadership in her increased role this
season. V

“A lot of our players are going to be in
new roles,” McCombs said. “We are really
excited about next year’s team.”

es,” Pitt coach Holly Aprile said. “I felt I

our overall level of play could have been,
should have been, better.” A _

A struggling offense plagued the Pan-
thers (25-24, 9_-15) all season, with their

team batting average of .231 second to last V

in the Big East. The Panthers didn’t qualify
for the Big East tournament last year after
making it the previous three seasons.

While it was a disappointing year,
Aprile saw improvement in her team as
the season progressed. ’

The Panthers improved at hitting the
ball where it was pitched, Aprile said,
particularly on driving balls on the outer "

half of thezplate to the opposite ﬁeld.
One possible reason for the inconsis-
tency was Pitt’s youth, as the Panthers
had 10 freshmen on the rosterand just
two seniors. . i - V . f 5 ' ii"
“I recognize that we had a young team,
so I knew there was a going to be a learn-
ing curve there,” Aprile said. “But I felt we
should have been more.consistent.”y “
Aprile found leadership from two of

the freshmen —— second baseman Kris- I

ten Cheesebrew and shortstop Niki Cog-
nigni. She said the two players greatly
improved their communication skills with
each other, their fellow inﬁelders and the
outﬁelders as the year progressed.
“Their fielding mechanics have got-
ten a lot better,” Aprile said. “They have
gotten better offensively, too. It’s a big
job to come in and take over those posi-
tions, and they have learned a lot and

gotten a lot better. Those positions really I

stand out.”

Cheesebrew batted .246 for the_year,—,,-.»

and her 25 RBIs were second on the team.
Defensively, the second baseman: has a

' .966 ﬁelding percentage with eight er-

rors on the season. Cognigni batted .222
with 18 RBIs and had a .881 ﬁelding per-
centage.

But the shortstop and second baseman
weren’t the only players on the team to
grow this year.

“We have matured overall with this 4

season under our belts,” Aprile said. “For
the freshmen, it’s getting used to traveling

and the experiences. They’ve definitely

grown from that.” j

Sam Card graduated from Pitt with 21

two seasons from 1999-2000. Card also

Panthers surprise in ‘09,
make Big East tournament

with a loss to West Virginia in the Big East
tournament. The 20-8 mercy rule loss was
a disappointing end to the Panthers’ season
and hopes of capturing a Big East crown,
but it was also a positive reminder of a
season that exceeded expectations.

In a preseason poll, coaches in the Big
East picked the Panthers to ﬁnish 11th out
of 12 teams in the conference.

But the Panthers utilized key newcomers
to put up a 28-19 record and overcome last
season’s disappointing 19-34 mark.

“We bounced back from a tough season
last year, and we did a lot better,” senior
catcher Morgan Kielty said. “That’s a trib-
ute to the guys’ characters on the team.”

One addition to the team was second
baseman Chris Sedon, who led the team
in most offensive categories.

“All- in all, the season was a success,”
Sedon said. “With the new coaches and
players we got, everyone started buying
into the idea of winning.”

In his ﬁrst year after transferring from
Lackawanna College in Scranton, Pa., Se-
don became the~16th player in Pitt history
selected to the all-Big East ﬁrst team. He
ﬁnished with a .398 batting average and
62 RBIs while setting single-season school
records with 22 home runs, 160 total bases
and 65 runs scored.

After having a self- deﬁned “pretty crum-
my fall,” Sedon credited his work ethic in
helping him improve his game and ease his
transition from Lackawanna, a Division 11
school, to Pitt’s Division I program.

“I put in a ton of time [practicing] at
Lackawanna, and here I put in more,” Sedon
said. “I was just looking to break [into] the
starting lineup, and the ﬁrst game I saw my
name on the lineup and I said, ‘Sweet!”’

Sedon’s seamless transition earned
him spots on four out of the ﬁve possible
All-America teams, including the Colle-
giate News Louisville Slugger First Team‘,
Baseball America Second Team, American
Baseball Coaches’ Association Third Team
and CollegeBaseballInsider.com Second
Team. V,

Earning four honors in one season is a
record for a Pitt player, and Sedon joined
seven other players in Pitt history as an
All-American.

But his performance not only caught
the eye of writers.

Scouts must have picked up on his stel-
lar season. In June, Sedon was drafted in

. the 10th round (30oth overall) of the MLB

Draft by the Detroit Tigers.

Junior Nate Reed was drafted in the 20th
round by the Chicago White Sox, giving Pitt
coach__]oeJordano the.15th and 16th players
drafted under his tenure.

player,” Jordano said. .

Along with Sedon, former Pitt football
quarterback Kevan Smith, inﬁelder Frank
Mercurio and catcher Cory Brownsten were
newcomers who helped the baseball team
this year. ,

With the inﬂux of new players, Pitt
easily could have had a down year as the
teammates got accustomed to playing with
one another.But Jordano said the team’s
chemistry started solidly and remained
that way. H

“When you are successful recruiting
these types of players —— a kid that wants
to achieve in the classroom, as well as on
the ﬁeld — it makes team chemistry easier
to achieve,” Jordano said.

The Panthers returned key players
from last year,’s team, including inﬁelder
Joe Leonard, shortstop Danny Lopez and
Kielty. A V

Kielty said the 12—run loss to West Vir-
ginia in the Big East tournament was a
tough way to end his career at Pitt.

“It wasn’t very fun going out that way
and losing that badly,”,Kie1ty said. “Atthe
end of the game, it was pretty emotional
because it’s the last year that this group
will be together.”

Jordano agreed.

“I believe we were better prepared and
ready to make some noise at the tourna-
ment,” Jordano said. “However, we made
some mistakes that we did not make all
year. We were the best ﬁelding team in
the conference and one of the best in the
country. We did not play well defensively in
the tournament and at critical times made
mistakes that cost us.” ,

But Jordano also said it was important
that his younger players got the exposure
to the tournament, as he feels next year’s
team will be a talented bunch.

“The core of the team isintact, and we
had a very‘ solid recruiting class,” Jordano
said. “Depending on the MLB Amateur
Draft, we could have one of the most tal-
ented teams we have ever had moving into
the new stadium.” ~

 

We bounced back from
a tough season last year,
and we did a lot better.
That’s a tribute to the
guys’ characters on the

team. ~ » ‘

Aprile said. “I just felt like I had higher

 I A group of three freshmen will join the
 _ ‘Panthers as they look to get back into the
 Postseason next year, and Aprile said their

versatility and offensive abilities will be
a key asset for the team.

Holly Stevens, a catcher from San Pe-
dro, Calif., batted .400 with 31 RBIs last
year. 9

Her high school team won the Los
Angeles city section title for the fourth
consecutive season, and she was named
the 2009 Los Angeles cityplayer of the
year.

“She plays ﬁrst base and she plays the
outfield,” Aprile said. “She can play third
base, as well. I expect her to really produce
at the plate and to really help us out.”

Emily Nowicki is a local pitching re-
cruit from Greensburg Central Catholic
High School who can also hit.During her
junior year, she got a hit in all 19 games
of the season, batting .631 for the year.

She also went 11-1 as a pitcher. She hit-

.460 last season.

Nowicki, whose father, Ed", is a for-
mer Pitt baseball player who graduated
in 1986, played primarily infield during
high school, but is expected to play out-
ﬁeld at Pitt. -

“I think that she’ll be able to sure up
our outﬁeld,” Aprile said. “She can really
produce at the plate and help our offensive
attack, too.” '

Krista Rodgers will also play multiple
positions for the Panthers. The outfielder,
named to the Palm Beach Post All-Area
first team, from Loxachatchee, Fla., can
catch, as well. '

“She’s got good speed and she’s very
aggressive in the outﬁeld. I also expecther
to help us a lot at the plate,” Aprile said.

Pair of Panthers drafted back-to-back in NBA Draft

Young
,headsto
emphis

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

It all ended well for former Pitt
basketball standout Sam Young.
_ Nearly one month after a dis-
.‘§[5’pointing_ slip. to. the .second.__.
round of the NBA Draft, Young
agreed to a three-year contract
with the Memphis Grizzlies on
July 25. .
The contract has a club option
, for a third year and gives Young
nearly $2 million in guaranteed
money. He will make $900,000
of it per year in the first and sec-
ond years.
“He’s excited he’s with a team
that really needs him,” Young’s
’ gent Lance Young, no relation,
said. “Memphis has a good start-
ing ﬁve but not a lot of depth at
-_ the two or the three. That’s where
he comes in. For the money that
he signed for, it was a pretty good
deal for a second—round guy.”
Young also has several incen-
tives written into the contract for
such accomplishments as mak-
ing the NBA All-Rookie team this
year. The incentives could total
‘$90,000, which would bump his
irst-year salary to $1.5 million.
“He’s got the maximum amount
of bonuses to be achieved,” Lance
Young said. “You can add up to 25
percent in bonuses to the con-
tract. A lot of it is team success
ﬁt if they win a certain amount
of games and get into the play-

offs, there’s a bonus. The other
bonuses are individual things,
like making the all-rookie team
or winning rookie of the year.”
M According to Lance Young,
gm Young wanted a shorter-term
deal than what the Grizzlies origi-
nally offered. It was important to
Sam Young that he become a free
agent at 27, after three years in
the league.

thing longer than a three-year

Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

When Dejuan Blair slipped some
20 spots lower than the spot at

» which‘ most thought he would be

taken in]une’s NBA Draft, many
in his camp and Pittsburgh were
furious.

But not Blair.

“It’s a dream come true,”
he said in a conference call. “I
should have been a first—round
pick, but Godwanted me to drop
to the second round.”

Blair was selected with the

. seventh pick in the second round

(37th overall) by the San Antonio
Spurs. '

Still, Blair has many reasons
to feel so optimistic, despite his
freefall into the second round.

Even with the drop, Blair’s
contract is not much different
from what it would have been had
he been picked in the ﬁrst round.
He signed a four—year deal last
month worth nearly $4 million,
with almost $3 million guaran-

teed —— a feat that usually only '

first—round picks achieve.

Also, by not going early in the
first round, Blair avoided joining
a losing team with a high pick.

Instead, he joins a perennial
NBA powerhouse, who ﬁnished
fourth in the Western Conference
last season and has won three
NBA Championships in the past
seven seasons.

Blair will also get a chance
to step in and play immediately.
The Spurs’ returning frontline is
relatively thin behind superstar
forward Tim Duncan, with only
Matt Bonner and Drew Gooden
averaging more than eight points
per game last season.

The Spurs still seek to im-
prove the forward position with
a trade this offseason that sent

New coach, system propel Penguins to Stanley Cup

Sergei Feldman
Staff Writer

After a crushing ﬁnals defeat to the dy-
nastic Detroit'Red Wings the previous
season, the Pittsburgh Penguins began
their quest at unﬁnished business poised

6 to change history.

As pundits began to ignore the league’s
unwritten rule of thumb that teams who
lose in the ﬁnals don’t make it back the

the series and lifted the Penguins to their
second Stanley Cup ﬁnals appearance in
as many years. Not even the Staa1broth—
ers competing against one another could
over-hype Malkin’s brilliance.

A difﬁcult yet controlled playoff j our-
ney reached the most challenging level in
professional sports —- the Stanley Cup
final. '

To make matters worse, the Detroit
Red Wings stood in the way of the fran-
chise’s third championship.

following season, the Penguins began to V _

ignore fundamentals.

Nearly three months of a season with-
out consecutive victories led to the end
of the organization’s relationship with
coach Michel Therrien on Valentine’s Day

acquisitions, general manager Ray Shero
provided the should-be contenders with

After an 18-3-4 run to end the regular

 _ season, the Penguins solidiﬁed a fourth-

' first round.

G The opponents were the Philadelphia

Soon, the Penguins were down 2-0 in

Penguins responded to that advice. They
only need to win one in Detroit.

It would have to be Game Seven.

The Penguins took Game Six and left

Role-player Maxime Talbot contintfed
to build on his reputation as a clutch per-

Current, new Panthers p cry in the summer eague

Srgqmmer league 4 153

with Wanamaker, Nasir Robinson
and freshman Dante Taylor.

The competition in the league
doesn’t match what the Panthers
will face during the season, but the

" players used the opportunity to keep
in shape in the offseason, as well as
work on their team chemistry.

It was also a chance for Pitt fans
to get their ﬁrst look at the incoming
freshmen — Taylor, Patterson, ].].
Richardson and Talib Zanna.

The freshmen will probably see
a lot of playing time this year, as Pitt
lost seniors Sam Young, Levance
Fields and Tyrell Biggs to gradua-
tion and sophomore Dejuan Blair

ngothe NBA.

According to Taylor, the four
freshmen are ready to take over
for the departed Panthers.

“We’ve got to come in and be
ready to play,” Taylor said. “We all

knew what we were coming into, *

and we all knew who was leaving, so
now we have to go and prove what
we can do on the court.”

The league also allowed many of
the Panthers to see their new team-
mates play for the ﬁrst time.

Brown played alongside Zanna
all summer and said he saw a lot
of positivesin the 6-foot—9-inch
forward.

“He’s a hustler, a player, goes
after every rebound,” Brown said.
“With a little bit of work, he’s going
to be a great player at Pitt.”

Brown thought similarly about
Taylor, saying the center has “great
natural basketball ability. Down the
road, he can be real good for us,
maybe even instantly.”

Along with the four incoming
freshmen, Woodall and Dwight Mill-
er redshirted last season, so they are
considered freshmen this year.

With six freshmen, the Panthers

have ayoung team entering the year, '

and during the summer, some of the
older players started to take to their
new roles as team leaders.

“Us three, being the ones that
played in the system, have to step
it up a little bit,” Brown said. “We
have four new guys and a few more
who redshirted last year.”

All of the Panthers sat on the
sidelines cheering one another
on during summer league games
in which they weren’t playing. The
trio of Dixon, Wanamaker and
Brown often were seen talking to
the younger players while on the
court or speaking in the huddle dur-.

. “We’re the most experienced '

players on the team,” Brown said.
“There are a lot of expectations of
us that we have to live up to, and I
think we will.’’

Dixon, who is expected to miss
two months but be ready in time for
the start of practice in the fall, also
said the three players will have to
lead the team this year.

“That’s a role we’re going to have
to take on,” Dixon said. “We knew
right after the Villanova loss [in the
Elite Eight] that was our job. We’re
deﬁnitely up for it.” 4

this summer.
This opportunity is a perfect

ished his sophomore year at Pitt
last season.
“I couldn’t have landed in
a better situation than I am in
now,” he said. “[San Antonio]
just traded Kurt Thomas, their
starting forward.”
Whilejefferson is a forward,
as well, his game is more suited
toward playing on the perim-
eter. Jefferson plays primarily
small forward, so he and Blair
ifarobably won’t be competing for
playing time at the same posi-
tion.
With superstar Duncan on the

. Spurs, Blair will get to learn from

one of the best power forwards
in the league. Duncan has aver-

But this is just the next wave
of skepticism that Blair has
had to overcome. Critics said
he couldn’t play in the post at
just 6 feet 7 inches tall, but he
proved them wrong.

Now, Blair seems to be on a
mission to show all the teams
that passed on him that he can
still be the kind of player that
terrorized opponents in the
paint during his two years at
Pitt.

“It’s time to go to work and

show people what they missed,”
he said.

So far this summer, he’s
lived up to that, as he’s looked
dominant in the NBA Las Ve-
gas Summer League, averaging

16.3 points and 81.7 rebounds per »

game and shooting a surprising

81.3 percent from the free-throw V

line. ,

who had one run—in with the law.

Should he get a job after ﬁnishing his house

Stallworth did what many people in this

chance to learn ﬁ'om their mistakes. Stallworth
wasn’t so lucky. .

The Reyes family agreed to the wrist slap of
a jail sentence because Stallworth paid them

deal, because he wants to be a
free agent and resign a big deal
with the Grizzlies when he’s 27 or
28,” Lance Young said. “He’s not
locked in like a first-round pick
wiiere they become a restricted
free agent after their contract is
up. Sam wanted to do a two-year
deal, but the Grizzlies wanted him
for four years, so we met in the
middle.”

The $900,000 in guaranteed

money wouldn’t have been a con-
cern for Young if he was drafted
in the first round. All ﬁrst-round
selections in the NBA Draft are
certified to receive a contract with
guaranteed money.
"="""'But, according to Lance Young,
about 10 to 15 second-round picks
end up signing contracts for guar-
anteed money. If a player doesn’t
sign for guaranteed money, a team
has to pay the player only if he
makes the team.

“Usually what happens with
second-round picks is they do
a three- or four-year deal and
incentivize the deal to almost
double it,” Lance Young said.

Sam Young averaged a team-
high 13.6 points and 4.2 rebounds

on 51.9 percent shooting in 25 A

minutes in the 2009 NBA Sum-
mer League in Las Vegas, helping
to lead Memphis to a perfect 5-0
record. The Grizzlies concluded
their summer league onjuly 19.

Currently, Sam Young is work-
ing out in Las Vegas at a camp do-
ing a skill workout.

“It’s sort of like a skills acad-
emy where the top players in the
Draft go and work out for five
days,” Lance Young said. A

With the signing of former,
Connecticut center Hasheem
Thabeet (second overall) and
DeMarre Carroll (27th overall)
earlier in the month, the Griz-
zlies have now signed all three of
the team’s selections in the 2009
NBA Draft. T

The Grizzlies begin regu-
lar season play in late October.
Young’s Grizzlies take on former
Pitt star Dejuan Blair and the
Spurs four times this year, with
the first meeting on Jan. 16 at
Memphis.

Staff Writer

Evaluation of the Pirates’ accomplishments
s season is very impressive. No, that was
t an attempt at sarcasm. This has actu-
y been the most successful Pirates sea-
F. in since 1992, when they last made the
"1aY0.ﬂ7Sei . _
l Remember, the goal is not to ﬁnish with
t awinning record. The goal is to win the
orld Series.’ And as absurd as this may
em, Pirates General Manager Neil Hun-
gton knows what he is doing. ' P
A "When Huntington took over the gen-
eral manager’s role in September 2007, the
manager wasjim Tracy. The starting lineup
l‘  ‘sisted of Nate McLouth, Freddy Sanchez,
on Bay, Xavier Nady, Adam LaRoche, Jose
utista, Ronny_Paulino and Jack Wilson.
The Pirates ended that season with the
worst record in the National League, and
exit in the minor leagues was non-existent.
~ hat is the worst place a team can be in pro-
fessional baseball. Huntington took over as

 

the dust by prior management, and within
__two weeks on the job, he made his ﬁrst move
in firing Tracy.
 Now, not even two years later, the Pirates
have a new manager and one of the best
minor league systems in all of baseball. Hun-
W tington traded every single 2007 starter, 16
players total, and is in the process of rebuild-
ing the team —- for real this time.
_ ' Currently, the Pirates have serious young

talent at every position. It can even be said
>tl'1_at the Pirates may have too much depth
 some positions, such as the outﬁeld or
“éatcher —- and that is always a surprisingly
good thing. 

Clearly the biggest move the Pirates made
this year was trading both middle inﬁeld-
; ers: shortstop Wilson and,second-baseman
., Sanchez. The Pirates ﬁrst traded Wilson
 and pitcher Ian Snell for three pitchers,
_{£_ ﬁrst-baseman Jeff Clement and shortstop
‘ . Ronny Cedeno. .

Cedeno is cut from the same mold as
_ Wilson except less expensive and more ver-
satile. Cedeno is a career .240 hitter with
ﬁve home runs, while Wilson is a .270 career
hitter with four home runs at the time of the
if trade. Wilson is making $7.4 million this
 Se-3S0n, while Cedeno makes $822,000. The
3 _ Pirates clearly saved millions in salary for
. ‘what might not even be an apparent down-
, " ‘grade on paper, let alone not on the ﬁeld. On
 . -t°P of that, they also got four more prospects

liratesmanagement making the right moves‘

t seeping the talent new and the costs down, the Pirates expect another proﬁtable season

Baseball America released their list of top
50 prospects in mid-Iuly and Alderson was
rated between the Phillies’ Kyle Drabek, who
Philadelphia refused to include in a deal for
Roy Halladay, and Pedro Alvarez, the top
prospect in the Pirates’ system. Alderson
instantly becomes the Pirates top pitching
prospect. So giving up Sanchez — who was
hitting .296 with six homers at the time of

the trade, and making $6.25 million this sea-
son — for Alderson is an enormous steal.
All the trades made in the past two years
will have a signiﬁcant effect in the Pirates‘
ﬁiture. The organization ﬁnally has manage-
ment that is not afraid to trade everyone in
return for future success. Before the Hun-
tington era, management would acquire vet-
eran players such asjeromy Burnitz or Sean

6—foot—7 with a 2.44 ERA in 16 minor league
starts.

Clement, 25, was the third overall pick
in the 2005 Draft and was rated by Baseball
America as Seattle’s No. 1 prospect in both _
2006 and 2008.

Then just hours after the Wilson-Snell
trade, the Pirates traded Sanchez to the
San Francisco Giants for Tim Alderson.

thejamie Dixon era — and the ﬁrst
‘since 1987 — a McDonald’s All-
American is going to be a Panther.
And Dante Taylor is a good one.
He’s a 6—foot—9-inch, 235—pound
beast who can score (23.8 points
per game as a senior), rebound (13
per game) and can even put the
ball on the ﬂoor (he won the Mc-

seen that at Pitt. Get excited.
Taylor will be running with

lion. Maholm, Matt Capps, Zach Duke, Ryan
Doumit, Ramon Vazquez and Tyler Yates

are the only players on the current roster .

making more than $1 million.

So the Pirates do have money. Before the
year started, management announced they
had no ﬁnancial troubles. Now their pay-
roll has taken a huge cut, which obviously
puts them in a very comfortable and sound
ﬁnancial situation. All the extra money can

be used in the future to re-sign players or —

acquire the requisite talent through free

After Marc—Andre Fleury's last—second save in Game 7 o'f the Stanley Cup Finals, the rgst
of the Penguins swarm the net-minder in celebration of the franchise's third Cgipg
. is

Penguins 4 157

But with seconds remaining, it ap-
peared Lord Stanley and his fabled Cup
would once again belong to the city of
Pittsburgh. 4

Then, a harmless shot from the point
by Red Wings defenseman Brian Rafalski
with four seconds remaining turned into
a rebound chance for the always—deadly
Henrik Zetterberg.

Fans and players waited to see what
would happen.

From a scrum of everybody on the ice,
the puck squirted off to a wide—open, soon-
to-be Hall—of-Famer Niklas Lidstrom, who
had nothing but an empty net at which to
look and shoot with two seconds remain-

ing in the game. 
Then, out of nowhere, Fleury sprawled
shoulder—ﬁrst into the p.uck’s eyes, gaini_ng
the victory and the Stanley Cup. 
The players embraced the young gobl-
tender in a state of hysteria. Their most
vivid childhood dreams of winning the
Cup championship couldn’t be rivaled
by the thrill and exhilaration of the r§al
deal.  :
The Penguins were Stanley Cup cha§_in—
pions. '1
And for players and fans, the season
was as unpredictable as the 35o,o00—peo-
ple turnout for the Cup champions’ [§a—_

and present Cup stories

ﬁlled with champagne, Froot Loops and even baby poop during celebrations.

Greg Trietley '

‘ Staﬁ” Writer

s a-tradition, the NHL grants each ,

member of the championship team
one day with Lord Stanley’s Cup dur-
ing the offseason.

And in its 116 years of existence, players —

have taken the Cup on a ride that includes
drop-kicking it into a canal, sinking it in a
pool and abandoning itin a snowbank.
This summer, the Pittsburgh Penguins
had their chance for adventures with the

most distinguished trophy in all of major .

sports when players and personnel had their
time with Stanley.

The winner of Best Stanley Cup Story so
far this year goes to Matt Cooke. The gritty
Pittsburgh winger opted to visit Belleville,
Ontario, on his special day. The mayor of
nearby Stirling, though, had other plans —
and he forgot to tell Cooke.

According to Yahoo Sports, Mayor Pe-
ter Kooistra of Stirling wrongfully assumed
Cooke would spend the day in his town and
planned a parade and party. But Cooke spent
the day in Belleville to raise money for his
charity, which led to a lot of embarrassed
looks and confusion coming from both
Stirling City Hall and Cooke.

Still, forgetting to relay parade details
can’t top forgetting the Cup itself, which
happened 85 years ago.

Some members of the championship-
winning Montreal'Canadiens headed out
to a party and stored the prestigious trophy
in the trunk of their car. A few miles and a
pop sound later they pulled over to repair
a ﬂat. Inthe rush, the team left the Cup in a
snowbank when they drove off.

And if you don’t ﬁnd that funny enough,
the priceless chalice still sat there when the
debaucherous champions retraced thei
steps later that night. 

Needless to say, today the NHL sends a
representative along with the Cup in order
to keep tabs on it and dents off it.

According to the Hockey Hall of Fame’s
onlinejournal, the Penguins’ Tyler Kennedy
started the trophy relay July 2 in Sault Ste.
Marie, Ontario. Petr Sykora is scheduled to
ﬁnish the celebration halﬁ/vay» across the
globe, in Plzen of the Czech Republic, on
August 30.

In between, the Cup sees the eastern
coast of Canada when it visits Sidney Cros-
by in Nova Scotia and the western coast
when it meets up with Eric Godard in British
Columbia. It crosses the Atlantic for S10-
vakian Miroslav Satan and tours the Rus-
sian frontier for Evgeni Malkin and Ruslan
Fedotenko.

A few more thousand miles on the odom-_
eter is nothing for North America’s oldest
professional sports trophy. The Cup has been
to the summit of a mountain — Mt. Elbert
in Colorado —— and to Afghanistan, where

Most players spend the day with friends
 family. Some visit hospitals. Some, like
ggooke, Max Talbot, Brooks Orpik and others,
uée the Cup as a way of raising money for
c farity. But even though things are tamer
than years ago and even though there’s a
representative now, the trophy, ﬁrst awarded
,ir£«?li893, still has its-odd moments.
. Like when possessors put things in the
Cup’s bowl this offseason: a snake Tyler
Kennedy’s cousin caught, Froot Loops and
champagne. Lots and lots of champagne.
The trophy will gladly take a snake, cereal
and alcohol over a repeat of Kris Draper’s
day last year. In every hockey mom’s dream
scrapbook moment, Draper’s newborn
daughter crawled into the trophy’s bowl.

Unfortunately, she soiled herself while in

it.

Sometimes the Cup’s journal reads like a
road trip comedy movie. Not only has it been
a toilet, but it has also served as both a dog
food bowl and a baptismal font.

Crosby scheduled his Cup time in Cole
Harbour, Nova Scotia, to coincide with his
birthday, Aug. 7. According to Metro Hali-

for the parade.

These festivities are in addition to the
time he spent with the Cup in a post—cham-
pionship celebration at Mario -Lemieux’s
house in mid-June‘. Lemieux’s- most memo-
rable moment with the trophy came in 1991,
when it sank to the bottom of his pool during

a party.

So what happened this year? According to 4

Yahoo Sports, Crosby took a swim with it.
That can’t be good for the silver, but the
Cup has been through worse.

Penguins Q&A:
After the Cup

Staff writers Sergei Feldman and Greg Trietley take on
questions left after the Penguins won the Stanley Cup

Sergei Feldman and Greg Trietley
’ Staff Writers

A lot of people dismissed the Penguins
when they were a few points out of a play-
off spot in February. What was the reason
for the team’s changeover and ultimate
success?

~  “‘Gi‘egTri”e‘tl‘ey: Tiieteasoﬁ‘ I 6r“tl'Ie"changé  '

in play was the ﬁring of Michel Therrien.
Nobody can deny Therrien’s excellent work
behind the bench two years ago, but the
team stopped listening to him. Dan Byls-

ma brought a new voice in February and : 

turned the season around. The talent that
languished under Therrien broke out under
Bylsma to the tune of a 34-11-4 record and
a Stanley Cup.

‘ Sergei Feldman: General Manager Ray
Shero made another efficient trade dead-
line, as he brought in top-six forwards Chris
Kunitz and BillGuerin, as well as cerebral
and experienced grinder Craig Adams. Very
quickly, talented players complemented
the Penguins’ young stars, which led to a

trickle—down of depth through the lineup, ,

The catalyst was a we1l—engineered trade
deadline, but the lesson learned was that
depth on this young team is a recipe for
championship success. V _ A '

Who was the better hockey player in
the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs: Evgeni‘
Malkin or Sidney Crosby? .

GT: Crosby was more consistent, but Mal-
kin won the Cup for the Penguins. Malkin

' emerged from aslump against Washington

and turned that series around, and when
Henrik Zetterberg and Nicklas Lidstrom shut
down Crosby in the ﬁnals, Malkin stepped
up with eight points in seven games. The
Penguins needed both stars, but Malkin’s
game reached new heights last spring.

SF: Neither out—perf'ormed the other.
What made the Penguins as potent as they
were during last season’s Stanley Cup playoff
run was that when one struggled — which
usually lasted about a shift — the other
shouldered the load. In other words, at
no point did the Penguins lack star power
down the middle. And let’s not forget Jor-
dan Staal.

Did Rob Scuderi deserve the contract

from the Los Angeles Kings, and did he ’

make the right decision?

GT: No. Scuderi is an above~average posi-
tional defenseman who had one outstanding
postseason. He doesn’t deserve four years
and $13.6 million. And the Penguins were

right to let him go at that price. Scuderi ~

should thank the insanity of the free agency
and the odd dealings of Kings’ general man~
ager Dean Lombardi for his payday. And it’s
not just the money. Why did Lombardi sign
him for four years when his team has three

former ﬁrst-round picks on the blueline _

ready to break out?
SF: Scuderi deserved the l0,I1E—term,,,,lu-

"cratilv’€:'é'51riti':aEt frofrithe Kings only because
he had gone his entire professional career
earning near the league minimum. His con-
tract will likely be his last and only big con-
tract, and it serves more to compensate him
for years of solid yet undervalued defensive
work. But the Kings overpaid aﬁfth or sixth
defenseman on any team. Players like Scud-
eri are, and always have been, expendable.
Good for him for jumping on the offer. As
far as the Penguins go, they simply couldn’t
afford to pay that kind of dough. 

What was Ray Shero’s best offseason
signing or re-signing? 
GT: Without a doubt, it’s the under—the-
radar inking of veteran defensemanjay Mc-

‘Kee. McKee came cheap -— $800,000 for

one year '— because of his injury history. He
isn’t washed up — he turns 32 in September
—— and he led the league in blocked shots
four years ago. He’s the gritty defenseman
opponents loathe in the playoffs. Should
McKee stay off the injured reserve, Shero
effectively replaced departure Hal Gill at
one-third of the price. It isn’t the biggest

signing, but it’s the best.

SF: Technically, Shero was responsible
for the shrewd signings of Bill Guerin (one
year, $2 million), Ruslan Fedotenko (one
year, $1.8 million) and Craig Adams (two
years, $1.1 million). But the credit has to go
to the three aforementioned athletes, who
each took less to stay on a Cup-contending
team in the free-agency period following a
Cup championship. It speaks to their charac-
ter and the new culture around the Penguins:
the drafting of Crosby, Malkin and Staal and
also the era of Shero. Veteran defenseman
Jay Mckee, however, was an absolute steal.

This is the last year for the Penguins
in Mellon Arena. What signiﬁcance does
raising the 2009 Stanley Cup banner at
the home opener have?

GT: Raising the banner kicks off a year
that will honor the many great Penguins
moments in the nearly 50-year-old arena.
There’s something to be said about a ban-
ner going up in the same dilapidated build-
ing that led to the threats of relocation. It
symbolizes a shift in the franchise, from
cellar dwellers thinking about leaving town

gliins. That’d be the 'way to go.

is the favorite, though. Keep in mind Pitts-
burgh didn’t dominate last year, ﬁnishing
fourth in the East. Washington, Carolina,
Boston and Philadelphia all look strong,
but don’t rule out a third straight Detroit-
Pittsburgh ﬁnal.

SF: All the players on the Penguins roster
can look at their locker room mirrors just
before taking the ice in the home opener and
say, “We can win it again. We are the team to
beat. The Cup will be ours again.” That could
and should be uttered with supreme conﬁ-
dence. But there’s a caveat: Too many teams
in the NHL can say the same thing with just
as much conﬁdence, and it would be equally
justiﬁable. It’s a testament to the equality in
the NHL, if nothing else. It’ll be a matter of
going out and actually getting it done. Still,

the Penguins are well—equipped.

Baseball: White Sox select Sedon, Reed makes return to Pit-t

One joins the White Sox after strong year, while the other comes back to Pittsburgh
as:

Jay Huerbin and Adam Littman
Sports Editors

As the awards piled up for former Pitt ,
V — secondbaseman Chris Sedonthis sum-
‘Qiner, he experienced one eventthatwas

betterthan them all: the MLB Draft.

In June, the Detroit Tigers used
their 10th-round pick to select Se-
don. A few days later, Sedon signed a
contract and started his professional
career.

He was the 10th second baseman
chosen in the Draft. '

Sedon was then assigned to one

of the Tigers’ minor league teams, the

OneontaTigers. The Tigersarepart of

; the New York-Penn league, a short-

Tseason A league that begins injune

aitertheIVILBDraftandlastsuntJ'learly
September. .

Because of the classiﬁcation,
teams in the New York-Penn league
play roughly 75 games instead of the
140 that are typical of other class A
leagues. ,

During his one year as a Panther,
Sedon was a standout inﬁelder at the
plate. He led the team in batting aver-
age and set a school record with 22

home runs. Hewas ranked amongthe
best collegiate second basemeninthe
country.

Following the Panthers’ season, Se-
donwas namedto the Collegiate News
Louisville Slugger First Team, Base-
ballAmerica Second Team, American
Baseball Coaches Association Third
Team and CollegeBaseballInsider.com
Second Team.

But with the move to the profes-
sional level, Sedonhasseenhisbatling
struggle.

He is batting less than .200 this
season — a big difference from the
.402 he batted with Pitt in his junior

. year—and didn’thave anyhomeruns

injune orjuly.

Still, batting struggles are com-
mon for ﬁrst-time players in the nu-
norleagues, and onlythreeplayers on
the Tigers teamarebatﬁng morethan
.300 this season.

Aftersigriinghis professional con-
tract, Sedon joined six other Tigers

Draft picks who were selected in the e-

ﬁrst 15 rounds of the 2009 Draft.
Following his time in the New

York-Penn league, Sedon is expected

to continue improving his game and

take part in an instructional league
with the Tigers organization.
While Sedon hadacareeryearand

‘opted to signwith the Tigers, Reedfelt

he underperformed this season and
will returnfor his senior yearwith the
Panthers. As the-Pitt’s No. 1 starting
pitcher; Reedwent4-6 witha6.21ERA.
He started 13 games, pitching 84 in-
nings, givingup 113 hits while striking
out 60 batters and walking 32.

“I could have had abetter year,” .
Reed said, “butI can’t say [my season] V

was a complete failure.”
Reed is a left-handed pitcher

, who throws afastball, curveball and

change-up. He said his fastball, which
reaches the low 90s, and change-up
are his best pitches.

While he said he’s dreamt of play-
ing in the major leagues since he was
a kid, Reed said he wants to complete
his degree in communication. He also

' said hethinkstheteamwillimprove

next year.

“The pitching staffwas youngthis
year, and itwas our ﬁrst yearwith our
new pitching coach [Brandon Row-
an],” Reed said. ‘We have a chance to
be really good next year.”
