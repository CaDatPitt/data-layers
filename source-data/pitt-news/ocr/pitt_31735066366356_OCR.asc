Rally Supporting GI’s in Vietnatn  

Homecoming Stars 
Draws Peaceful Crowd of 1500; 

Nightclub Acts

Lisa Kirk and the,Four Saints highlight the Homecom-
ing entertaimnent at the Holiday House, Nov. 5. The double“
billing of the nightclub entertainer and vocal-instrumental
group represents “two top shows for the price of one,” ac-
cording to Jimmy Meyerson, Homecoming chairman.

A singer, dancer, and comedi-
enne, Miss Kirk began her act-
ing career at the Pittsburgh Play-
house. She made her New York

‘debut in.Richard Roger's musi-

cal, Allegro, followed by Cole,Por-
ter’s Kiss Me Kate.

Miss Kirk has had record-break- ‘

ing engagements at the Waldorf’s
Empire Room, the Plaza’s Persian
Room, Miami's -Eden Rock and

Americana, the Sahara in Las

Vegas, and the Caribe Hilton in
San Juan, Puerto Rico. I
. Besides guest appearances on
“The Ed Sullivan Show,” “Bell
Telephone Hour,” and the “Dinah
Shore Show,” Miss Kirk has star-
red in the touring companies of
Say Darling, Show Boat, Panama
Hattie, and her own One Woman
Show.

In a review in the Jan. 14, 1965,

issue of the New York World,

Telegram and Sun, Frank Farrell
said: “Throughout the entire act
Miss Kirk eﬁervesces with charm
and versatility. It's the pace of
her show that fascinates. There's

5,.-//fenough variety in her act to
" ‘please everybody.” ’

The Four Saints, Jerry Du-
Chene, Bob Erickson, Doug Evans
and John Howell, have been sing-
ing and playing together for
more than 12 years. Howell
ﬁrst organized the group was a‘
high school ‘barbershop quartet
called “The Kord Kings” in‘ the
state of Washington. ‘

Later, the group expanded its
act from straight barbershop to
instrumental routines. All of
them play the trumpet and trom-
bone while Howell plays 16 in-
struments in all. I

They received» a group music
scholarship from the University
of Puget Sound . in return for

tours of the Northwest on behalf '

of A the university’s; public rela-
tions department.

Under their new name, , “The
Four Saints,” they were attached
to the,U.S. Air Force Band for
four years. They have been per-
forming professionally since 1961.

They play music ranging from
jazz, ballads,» musical comedy,

0’

LISA KIRK
and opera to rock and roll, coun-
try and western, and folk music.
The group’s sources of material
are largely their own.

While DuChene contributes
lyrics and staging ideas to the
Four Saints’ repertoire, Erickson
copies all the musical scores» for
the group. Evans provides the hu-
mor in the group's act and has
written, the words and music. for
several of their most popular bal-
lads. Howel has Written most of
the vocal and instrumental ar-

rangements for the group.

The Four Saints have perform-
ed in concerts at such colleges as
Ohio State University, Purdue
University, and West Point Mili-

tary Academy. They, have ap- .

peared ' on such television pro-
grams as the “Jackie Gleason

"Show" and the “Tonight Show.”

‘Clean - Shaven

By ALAN DISLER

Between 1,300 and 1,800
students from the Univers-
ity and other participants
jammed the Fifth Avenue
side of the Student Union
Wednesday to register sup-
port for the United States’
troops in Vietnam. There
was also a minor counter-
demonstration. _.

The student organizers of the
rally, Jim Smith and Pete Mor-
gan and SG Senators Bill Lerach
and Marty Engels, explained that
“Our soldiers are ﬁghting for us

and it’s about time we showed,

our support.”

State Senator Jack’ McGre'gor
(Republican) and State Repre-
sentative Thomas Lamb (Demo-
crat) addressed the crowd. Rep.
Lamb, quoting Thomas Paine,
said that “the sunshine patriot
will shrink . _. . real ones will
stand up” in times of dire need.

He ‘also quoted President John

’Kennedy’s inaugural address say-

ing, “only a few generations have
been granted the -role of defend-
ing freedom in. its hour of maxi-
mum danger. I do not 

from this responsibility . . . I
welcome it . . .” ‘

Lamb asserted that those in

support of the American commit-
ment in Vietnam- “do not want
to suppress opposition to their
view, only point out that the op-
position is not symbolizing the
majority.”
. Sen. McGregor cited some of
the reasons for the demonstra-
tion. “We deeply resent the re-
cent draft card burnings. We are
here to wave drafts cards since
our free society is worth preserv-
ing.”

He recognized “the basic con-
stitutional right to protest and
dissent. iWe are not here to stif-
ﬂe the opposition, but to outshout
them. Let us not permit a mili-
tant minority to- give our genera-
tion alblack eye and to causean

p   Tower C   Questions  

' By A HOBIE HARRIS

The Men’s Dorm Council (MDC)
concentrated on revising new po-

licies for the use of the Towers.

Lobby by student and non-stu-
dent. organizations ,2 Wednesday

' , night in a meeting which brought

up the problem of Tower C's rep-
resentation in MDC.

f After a short debate over the ,-
wording of sections of the pro-

posalgwas adopted by the Coun-

cil by .a vote of 39 to one.

I “We hope to clarify the issues N
surrounding this proposal to- _ .

posals which they had received»
that afternoon. After allowingthe
senators several minutes to fami-
liarilize themselves with «them,
he attempted to‘ outline the philo-
sophy behind their conception.

“We are not. censoring any-
one,” Lefton continued. “We have
made an effort to keep the door
open to philosophies other than
our own.”

After several senatogs had
spoken ” on. the proposals, two

' graduate students from Tower C
.asked to speak. They were in- ~

formed that not being senators,,’_

two-thirds of the senate support-
ed *a motion to suspend the pro-

hibition. No one entered such a V

motion. ' — V

A After the meeting was adjourn-
ed, Harvey Frand, one of the
graduates, explained that the

1,400 residents of Tower C do not

have a single representative on
MDC, had‘ no chance to voice
their views on the proposed rules,

‘and in fact wereinot even notiﬁed

that-_a committee was working on
them. V A ' '

day's ralley to support the ﬁghting men in Vietnam. A

_ empty feeling in the stomachs of

our fighting men.”

Smith stated that this “is the
ﬁrst time you ‘apathetic’ students
have done something as a group.
This is the biggestshowing of the
clean-shaven imajority on this
campus.” He further said that “I
think that we as students should
stop taking the brunt of bad
publicity from the minori .”

Engels spoke to American troops
in Vietnam. “If you are willing
to give up your lives, we respect
and. honor “ you iwith all we’ve
got,” he said. ‘

Lerach introduced to the crowd
Sgt. Richard Kujowski,’ who had
just returned from Vietnam with
the purple heart. He receivg the
greatest applause of the day.

Lerach commented that “We
haven't burned any draft cards,
stormed any troop trains, or said
that we wet our bed to get out
of the draft. We have been si-
lent up until now and we must
never fall silent again. The spot-

Lefton pointed out that this

‘was the ﬁrst time that the grad-

uates had shown_ an interest in
MDC and that they had been ap-
proached by 1VlDC two years ago
but had shown no interest at that

time.

Lefton further stated in a ‘dis-

If Wednesday’s rally demonstrated the voice of the previously non-
lvocal, apathetic majority, it may unfortunately be that that voice has
spoken its first and last words for the year. i

 Nearly 1,500 of the previously non-vocal_majority came to yell, cheer,
and assert their support of the men ﬁghting in Vietnam. ‘

Their purpose was to show that not all studentswere draft-card burn-
ers disagreeing with United States Vietnamese policy. The ad hoc com-

._moral support to the soldiers. ,

Their" purpose was just, patriotic, and needed expression. It was
.handled well. Pokes at the minority were not slanderous, and it was made
explicit that the right to criticize -policy was respected by the previously
_ non-vocal majority. l

V But the voicing of the support on this issue does not insure the main-
?-tainance of active involvement by the majority. The defense of patriotism
was‘, and justifiably so, a safe stand. A

C, Even those who opposed the rally sang the national anthem. So the
«previously non-vocal majority has spoken. Will it speak again?

Will members of the previously non-vocal majority speak on other
issues involving students on this campus? Will members of the previously
non-vocal majority speaks on Student Government issues ? Will they become
involved in student organizations?

If the past is used as evidence, the probability is they will not remain
"active. Hopefully, they will not follow the past.

Hopefully, they will not regress into the same worn-out, illegitimate
A excuses of “I could care less” and “So what?” Hopefully, they will not be
afraidgto voice their views when they are not good for public relations.
 Hopefully, they will speak even when state representatives are not avail-

Men’s Dormitory Council (MDC) is behind the times. Thereare peo-
ple living in Tower C. ‘

At their meeting’ Wednesday, the Council successfully repressed the
presence of unrepresented Dormitory residents. They refused to suspend
parliamentary rules and allow two residents from Tower C, to speak on the
lobby rules issue. -

"The glorious Senate of MDC was either afraid of the opposing view or
so self-centered that they had to demonstrate their importance by manipu.
lation of parliamentary power. A

The two should have been allowed to speak whether their views were
pro or con. They are “residents of the Tower dormitories and must live
under the new rules. In essence, the rules to , them are now legislation
without representation. '  ’

MDC President Harvey Lefton uses the excuse that two years ago the
graduate students of Tower C had been approached but “had shown no
interest at that time.”

But “that time” is not 1965. At “that time,” there‘ were only men
and women graduate students occupying a minor part of Tower C. Now
there are 1400 (tower capacity is 1876) residents including men and women
graduates and undergraduate women. They are represented nowhere.

-They should have representatives on the Men’s Dorm Council or at
least the right to speak. Lefton avoids present conditions when he argues
that any future MDC Senators from Tower C could utilize the amending
procedures. " .» -

The Tower C residents live in the Dorms and should be represented
on its governing body. .MDC should not solely serve undergraduate men
living iii the Towers. It should represent and legislate for all Tower dormi-
tory residents. Tower C deserves representation now. I »

Perhaps Lefton has just reason for postponing the future. The two
graduate students were opposing a piece of Lefton-backed MDC legislation.

1

They may have inﬂuenced opinion, creating some opposition to the sacred ‘

proposal. The vote may not have been 39 to one. _
They may have helped refine some of the poorly-phrased revised

rules. They may have given a broader perspective. They may have con- "V

tributed, but they were unjustiﬁably deiﬁed the right.

Being Frank

. e _ THE PANTHERS ARE TABOO '

- . FOR THOSE who believe in Friday the thirteenth, the

’reat Pumpkin, and witches and goblins, the 1965 Panther

ootball team should be added to your list. Just look at the

ecords of past teams to see how they have done after they
avejfaced the gridders. ' i

OREGON WAS the first team hexed and they have re-
gretted it ever since. Len Cassanova must have used all his
lucky charms to beat the Pant_her,s for it has run out the
«last couple of weeks. After winning over two teams that
would have trouble winning the WPIAL, his team has drop-
tped games to Sanford and Washing. His team is now 2-2-1.

 "“ OKLAHOMA HAS NOT even fared as well as Oregon.
7jThey lost to Texas and Navy after they met the gridders
and also beat two teams that would have a rough time win-

gning in the intramural leagues. \

WEST VIRGINIA was the gridders third opponent, and
‘hey were riding sky high. They had scored 90 points in
their ﬁrst two games and added 63 tallies against their arch‘;
.rivals. The next week they played lowly Citadel and score

f25"points.
 A LET DOWN against the Citadel was expected after

V3, tough game the week before. Conﬁdently the Mountain-
-eérs met the Cavaliers of Virginia and were trounced, 41-0.

(State came up with 44 and the West Virginians were snake
bit.» «

FOR SCEPTICS whd say the Panthers have played
‘lousy against competition, the only answer is that they may
be right. ‘But certainly Duke was not a poor football team-.
Theycwere 3-0 before the)’ met the gridders, and all Were

away game victories against good teams. . .

AFTER DEFEATING the gridders, they must have
lost favor with almighty Zeus because they are at present
04-2. They lost to Clemson, 3-2, and to Illinois, 28-14‘; Coach
,»Bill Murray is now wishing his team was named more ap-.
propriately than the Blue Devils. '

NAVY WAS starting to hit ‘their stride until they

ftangled wit-h thehhex of the East. They gutspirited the Pan-
jithiers, 12-0, but their spirit didn't do them any good the next
j:week,_ They were annihilated by Georgia Tech, 36-16, and
*the jinx showed that it had nothing to do with patriotism.

4 MIAMI HAS not h-ad an opportunity to feel the effects
_  their game. There is no doubt that'a hurricane Will hit
it Miami on their practice field this week. They don’t play for
,two weeks so they get a rest, and the grief that is sure to
;come their way will be delayed. If a hurricane does come
fthrough Miami, I think it would be a good idea to change
lheutraditions of naming it after women and call it “Johnny

“Last week was acrucial game

we must prove, not only to our-

j are of championship material.

And if we win our next three or
four games, we will be consider-
ed as such,” said Bemis.

A strong ﬁnish for a team
which stood 1-1-1 after its ﬁrst
three encounters could result in a

playoff berth, but the team must ‘

support a good record, by _scor-
ing much more" than the opposi-

_ tion. “Penn State beat West Vir-

for the ‘lost to West Chester, 4-1,
the soccermen have allowed no

This includes two shutouts.

At the. same time, the boot-
er’s record shows no more
than three goals a game scored
by them. “To' complement our
line, we Want our halfbacks to
score more, thus forming almost
a seven -man line. Last week,
Ohio respected them and layed
off our small forward line. As
the halfbacks kicked the ball at‘

Orange Blockers
Present Problem
In Keying Little

_ By TOM SACKS

The football team will be
in New York ‘City tomorrow
for the Syracuse game with
only one thought on their
minds—-“Stop Floyd Little.”

Little, who was an All-Ameri-
ca last year as a sophomore, is
already being compared to two
other great Orange backs, Jimmy
Brown and Ernie Davis. If the
gridders are as successful at stop-
ping» Little tomorrow as they
were at halting Brown, Coach
John Michelosen will be very
pleased.

In the two games in which the
Panthers faced Brown back in
1955 and 1956, they held the now
professional star to less than 80
yards. The task won’t be as easy
tomorrow because of the addi-
tional threat of fullback Larry
Csonka, 6’3”, 230 pounds.

Csonka,, a. sophomore, has ca,r— .

tied the ball 60 times for‘ 309
yards, while Little has gained
552 yards on 105 carries. “We
have to stop_Little if we’re going
to win,” said Michelosen. “Their
‘having Csonka, back there makes
it that much harder.”

Another reason it will be hard
to key on Little tomorrow is the
mammoth size of Syracuse's of-
fensive line. They’re all at least
6’3’’ with the exception of one
iwho is only 62”. Their weight
averages 230 pounds.

“They are just a typical Syra-

cuse team—big and strong,” said
Darrel Lewis, who scouted the

» Orange. “They-like to push you«

around and try to run over you.”

Heading their blocking attacks
is center Pat Killorin, another
All-American last year. “He makes
the difficult block look easy,”

said Orange coach Ben Schwa.rtz- '

walder.

_Despite their size and Csonka, "

Little is still their offensive team.
“There’s nothing he can't do,”

said Lewis. “He’s deﬁnitely of ,_

the same caliber as Brown and
Davis.” ‘ ‘

Miami stopped Little and Won
the game, 24-,0. When comparing
the Orange and the Panthers af-

'ter his 28-14 loss, Last week. Mi-
ami cdach Charlie Tate said,

- “Pitt has a better team than the

one ‘we played at Syracuse. Of
course, they have Little, but Pitt
has Lucas and Crabtree and Lu-
cas knows how to keep a drive
going.” ’
Alot tomorrow will depend on
whether the Panthers work as a
team as they did last week. “The
whole team.was pushing .and rush-
ing. They really came through,”
said" Michelosen. “The offensive
guards played a great game. Our
defense and offense ﬁnally got
together.” .
