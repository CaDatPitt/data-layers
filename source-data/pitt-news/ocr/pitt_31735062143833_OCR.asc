Those who have._-watched the devel-

That is -e;Azactly'* what _‘fJock"_ Suther-

the teamisv ﬁguring on. .A_ '
The Tech schedule does not call for

any hard contests previous to the

Pitt game other than the game with ‘

 & J. on October. 18, so that it is
pretty hard to tell at this time how
strong they are. ' The Plaid always

ﬁg-ht-hard_-aga_i_n-st Pitt, however, and

the game between the teams coached
by “Wally” ‘Steffen and “Jock” surn-

Forbes Field will be packed to the

’ManyiFor1ner Pitt M
Stars Move About
As Colleges Qoaches
While-Vi Jock Sutherland ‘opens his

 year as the University of Pitts-
burgh footballcoach, nearly all of the

old Pitt warriors" coaching in Western -

Pennsylvania ’ are involved in the
greatest ushakeup which ever took
place in this end of the state. It is
doubtful if a. greater number of simi-
lar changes were ever made in an-
other section of the country before
the opening of a year’s-grid campaign.
Herb Mccracken, last year at Alle-
gheny, steps winto "the position vacat-
ed‘by Sutherland at Lafayette, as
Tommy Davies, one ofthe-most fa-
mous of Panther backs, moves his
‘trunks from Geneva to Allegheny.
Jack Sack, Davies’ assistant at Ge-
‘neva, has won the promotion to the
.hic‘ad -coaching; position and, for a
month», claimed Hoot Flainnagan. J akie
Bohren's 1923’running mate. as his
right bower. Chalky Wil1iamson’s
advent to the Pitt coaching staff-as
Sutherland’s assistant, leaves Charley
Bowser to step up one position and
assume commandat Grove City. Red
Seidelson, the stubbornness of last
year's line here, has accepted a con-
tract to, give Bob Peck, 1916 Panther
All-American, a hand at Culver Mili-
tary Academy, Although it was ru-
mored that McLaren would leave Cin-
cinnatiyhe is still on the job there. '
' Among the class 13 colleges in Wes-
tern Pennsylv'a.nia.,’ only -one man,
"Tommy Holleran at Thiel, has kept
his old position. At Duquesne, Mike
Shortley succeeded Hal Benin and
