Provost Tells Freshmen

Of Student

Men of Class of 1943
Hear Fitzgerald Speak
At Traditional Banquet

Heralding a new era in student”-
faculty relations, Rufus Fitzgerald,
provost of the University, presented
to the class of 1943 at..its Freshman
Banquet on VVednesday night, the
University’s detailed program of stu-
dent welfare for the coming year.

Mr. Fitzgerald, speaking on behalf
of the administration at the freshman
induction ceremonies, explained that
“the spirit of the University is de-
pendent upon the loyalty and sincer-
ity of the students.”

Wants Loyal Students

He added that Pitt wants a loyal
student body, and that any difficul-
ties in ;achieving that goal will be
eliminated. “Go see somebody if
you’re sincere-don’t yell about it,”
he said. 1, A

The Provost said that the student
body will now begin to “live” in the
Cathedral. As an
Cathedral’s atmosphere, Mr. Fitzger-
ald suggested the new Tuck shop
and the information room which" are
to be completed this month.

“I would like to see as ﬁne a place
for students as for any others,” Fitz-
gerald added.

Construction has been slow, the
Provost said, because the University’s
purpose is to set the standards high
and have the students come up to
them.

SFA President Speaks

Coinciding with the address of
Mr. Fitzgerald, Patrick Cusick, C40,
president of the Student-Faculty
Association, declared that the oppor-
tunity is here for students, “Forty-
one stories high_—see what you can
do with it.”

Henry DeRocher, M40, president of
l\’len’s Council, conducted the cere-
mony at which the 485 men students
were acceepted as Pitt students.

Other speakers at the banquet in-
cluded Elmer Holbrook, dean of the
School of Engineering, who was
toastmaster, and Dr. Vincent W. Lan-
fear, dean of men; Dr. Stanton C.
Crawford, dean of the College; Dr.
Charles Tippetts, dean of the school
of Business Administration, and
Harold Viehman, C39, assistant sec-
retary of the YMCA.

Greek Room Group
Receives Additional

Aid for New Room

A gift of 150,000 drachmae, orl
$1,200, has been made to the Uni—]

versity’s Greek room, announces
Nicholas Kalmer, chairman of the
committee in charge.

The money, a gift from the Min-
istry of Public Instruction of Greece
through the sponsorship of General
John Metaxas, makes possible the
carving of the white Pentellic mar-
ble for the columns and the grey
Kokinara mable for the ﬂoor and
wainscoting.

In about three months, when the
carving has been completed, the
marble will be shipped here. Furni-
ture for the room, which will be
erected in the spring, has already
been made.

With white marble columns, white
marble door and lintel and frame,
grey marble ﬂoor and wainscotfand
plaster ceiling with a spiral meander
pattern and plaster frieze, color ty-
pical of the classical times will be
found in the designs in the ceiling
and the frieze where gold, blues, and
more brilliant tints will give the
room authnticity.

Can You Tell Me

of Pittsburgh, in building informa-

versity is installing an Information
Room to answer the questions of
students and visitors.

Directly opposite the office of the
University Hostess, painters, car-
penters and cement ﬁnishers have
been working to get the room pre-
pared for opening as soon after
registration as possible.

Any information regarding eve-
ning classes, directions of rooms and

be answered by regular employees
of the University, assisted by part-
time student workers.

From 8:30 a. m. until the Cathe-
dral is closed in the evening, it is
hoped, that among its many uses,
this room will facilitate the ﬁnding
of lost articles.

Opening in approximately two
weeks, the bureau will eliminate the

College Adds New
Astronomy Course

To List of Studies

Listed as “Man and the Stars,” a

ed to the College Curriculum, ac-
cording to Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the College. ,

James Stokley, director of the
Buhl Planetarium, will teach the
course which will be held Thursday
evenings in the Planetarium.

Although it was built primarily for
the enjoyment of the persons with no
knowledge of astronomy, the Plane-
tarium is also the ideal medium for
teaching fundamentals of astronomy,
Dr. Crawford said.

“In it the teacher can show his
student all the visible stars at one
time,” explained Dr. Crawford, “or
he can show the universe moving at
the rate of a thousand years’ time in
a few minutes.”

Mr. Stokeley’s lectures will be sup-
plemented by talks by other members
of the Planetarium staff. The Univer-
sity class will meet in the “theater
of the. stars” in the exhibit halls of
the Institute of Popular Science, and
in the lecture hall where astronomic-
al motion pictures will be shown.

Decorations, as yet, have not been
completed but the ﬂoor will be ﬁn-
ished today and light ﬁxtures and
doors will be installed this week.

Carved in old English and Gothic
style, the ceiling will match the fur-

walls painted in old parchment col-
or, will form a background for the
stained floor which will match the
ceiling.

Containing attendants tables and
desks, the room will serve a purpose
beneﬁcial to students and faculty.

Originally the idea of Dr. John G.
Bowman, Chancellor, the plans were
worked out with John VVeber, secre-
tary of the University and Gustave
Ketterer, interior decorator.

Wichmann to Give
Daily Organ Recital

Beginning today, organ programs
will be presented daily from 1‘—to 1:30
o’clock in Heinz Chapel by Russell
G. Wichmann, University organist.

Yesterday afternoon Dr. William R.
Farmer, director of University
Chapel services, spoke at a Vesper
service in the Chapel. Dr. Farmer

discussed “The Shape of Things to
Come.”

Under the direction of Theodore
M. Finney, assistant professor of
music appreciation, the Chapel choir
sang “Mighty Spirit, All Transcend-
ing,” a Mozart anthem. Mr. Wich-
mann’s selections were the “Prelude

“Harmonies du Soir,” by Robert L.
Bedell, and “All Glory Be to Thee”
by Gordon Phillips.

Corley Announces
Fraternity Co-op

Business Manager

Thomas Westermann, BA40, has
been appointed business manager of
the Fraternity Cooperative Buying
Association, according to Robert R.
Corley, assistant dean of men and
superviser of the group.

During the past summer, the asso-
ciation published a 34-page book en-

titled “The Fraternity Steward’s
Guide Book” and distributed it to
members. The book was written by

and nutritionist.

Chapters dealing with the nutri-
tive needs of the body, menu plan-
ning, and food selection and market-
ing also contains charts on weights,
kinds, and shrinkage of meats, lists
of foods necessary in a person’s diet,
and suggested menus for the three
main meals of the day.

The association was inaugurated in
the fall o-f 1932 in an endeavor to ef-
fect substantial savings for the fra-
ternities.

The committee expressed its regret over the resignation of Dr. John B-
Sutherland from the position of head football coach last winter, an event
which resulted in the formation of the committee on March 20 at the request?

Chaplain Talks
On College Life

“Just what does a University edu-
cation mean to you?” asked Dr. Wil-
liam R. Farmer, University chaplain,
as he introduced the serious view-
point to freshmen at Vespers Serv-
ice on Thursday afternoon at 3:45
o’clock in Heinz Memorial Chapel.

Stressing the importance of “mak-

 ing something” of their four years at
 Pitt, Dr. Farmer, suggested the read-
l ing of “The Meaning of a Liberal

Education” by Everett Martin.
 He expressed his beliefthat the

.“major elective” (personal interest

would in terms of greater scientiﬁc
knowledge increase each person’s
mechanical ingenuity in the saving
of his soul.”

Dr. Farmer declared that in the
use of this knowledge, he hoped that
the class of 1943 would be motivated
by something higher than personal
character and industry and would
strive to eliminat the destructive use
to which man has put the inventions
of science.

Referring to the general outbreak
of war in Europe, he said, “there is
something lacking in a civilization
which canturn this scientiﬁc knowl-
edge into the channels of war and
destruction.”

Parking Bate Set
For Ruskin Field

Special student rates have been
obtained for parking on Ruskin
Field, according to Robert R. Cor-
ley, assistant dean of men. Until the
first of October, the charge will be
ten cents per day for students.

Beginning October 1, monthly
parking privileges will cost $1.50 per
month. Colored stickers will be is-
sued to students paying the fee, to

‘be placed on the left inside wind-

shiuld.

Students are allowed to park only
during the day, and not on Saturday
or evenings.

Home Again

Gof Chancellor John G. Bowman, pri-

marily for the purpose of studying
the protests arising over the Suth-
erland case.

At that time, Dr. Bowman, stated‘.
that the committee was to have:
“Complete liberty to look into any-
thing they want to . . the more:
they look into it the better, as far‘
as l’m concerned.”

The reading of the complete re-
port consumed more than an hour
of the four hour meeting attended‘:
by all but seven of the 31 trustees...
No action was taken on the report:
by the board.

Interviewed Many

The committee revealed that it:
had interviewed more than 40 uni-
versity administrative Voﬁicers,
deans, instructors, and representa-
tives of student and alumni groups.
All agreed with the committee that:

“Dr. Sutherland’s resignation:
was a distinct loss to the university.”
Further, the change in the athletic
policy, endorsed by the committee,
was made “so abruptly that unnec-
essary controversy was created.”

It was

tive functions was labeled as “de-
sirable,” the committee stating that
“the administrative set—up of the
University does not provide ade-
quately for deﬁnite assignment of
authority and responsibility.”

As a specific recommendation it
was urged that deans of the various
schools, acting as an advisory cab-
inet, meet regularly with adrninis-
trative oﬁicers. Faculty members
also, should be consulted on educa-
tional policy, the committee decided-
On Academic Freedom

Lack of academic freedom, a charge
often hurled at the University, was:
denied, the report claiming that ‘after
“The problem of academic freedom

. was dis-cussed in all the com-
mittee’s conferences with deans‘ and
faculty members” the committee was
“convinced that academic freedom
is not violated at the University.”

Present tenure practices were up-
held by a recommendation that :2

Camp at Kon-0-Kwee Introduces
Freshman Men to University Life

From the opening of camp Satur—¢

day afternoon" until the ﬁnal meet-
ings with’ the deans of their respec-
tive schools yesterday, the 125 fresh-
men who attended the ninth annual
Freshman Camp at Camp Kon-O-
Kwee, near Zelionople, were certain
that there is something new under
the sun in the way of fun and en-

A tertainment.

With a fast-moving program of
sports, the Camp really got under
way Saturday morning, Friday’s ac-
tivities being devoted primarily to
getting acquainted and organized into
school groups under the direction of
a corps of upperclass advisers and
activities leaders.

From the talent gleaned from the
tents on the hill, master of ceremon-

ies Jack Hoeveler, C40, put on an‘

amateur stunt night Saturday eve-
ning, which was followed by movies
shown by Mr. Potts, director of in-
tramural athletics, and athletics di-

rector of the camp. Playoffs i_n.the
mushball league and athletic tourna-
ments were held early Sunday after-
noon.

In a series of round table discus-
sions and meetings with recognized
campus leaders and faculty advis-
ers, freshmen were given an oppor-
tunity to learn about fraternities, ac-
tivities, and University, and the best
ways to get the most of their four
years in college. At the non-secta-
rian religious service held yesterday
morning, Dr. S. P. Franklin, profes-
sor of religious education, spoke on
College values.

Sponsored each year by the YMCA,
Freshman Camp was founded by W.
W. Mendenhall, former executive
secretary of the YMCA, who is di-
rector of the United Religious Activ-
ity at,Cornell University. The 1939'
camp "was under the direction of

of the YMCA. '

‘We Wonder About the [load

Todaywe of the University are taking the road back—t:he~« road
Eback to classes. Vile are going to be spending most of our time think-
ing about lectures, exams, football games, and dances, but occasion-
ally, when we are reading front-page news, we will be reminded of
some other young people who are also going back.

Those young people belong to Europe; they are taking another
road‘-ba'ck—to war.

Just a few hours before these young people started back. Chester‘
 Rowell, University of California regent, and noted journalist, stood
before an assembly of students in the Greek Theater at Berkeley and
said, “Twenty-one years ago I stood on this stage addressing Uni-
versity men in uniform. May God grant that I may never have to do

it again !”

4 -.-He might have been speaking before any unlvcrsi_ty or college.
Those persons who were at‘ our University twenty-one years ago
know that the same thing happened here. The men were assembling
in uniform, and addresses were given; the track house and the print
shop buildings were hurriedly built for barracks; and parade grounds
were busy.

It is possible that it may happen again, but we hope it won ’t.
Last. spring, residents of Pittsburgh were treated to a minor thrill
when the military department imported anti-aircraft equipment for
a demonstration on the Logan Armory ﬁeld.

That was all right as a novelty, and it will be all right so long as
such demonstrations remain only a minor thrill.

Anti-aircraft. guns, directors, and sound locators just don’f fit in
with our conception of education. And kakhi uniforms dou’t go
very well with our Commons Room.

The University Advertises

Looking through an advertising folder yesterday, we found some
ideas about the University which seemed to be worth repeating. If
these are advertising, let ’s have more of them:

“The University. isnow an expression of practical hope that boys

and girls here will ﬁnd what they can do best, throw themselves into ’

the doing, and become the glory of the commonwealth."—Chancellor
John G. Bowman.

“To know some useful and wise matters well, to think straight
and soundly, to ﬁnd joy in every day is the purpose of teaching and
of learning at the University of Pittsburgh.”

“Life in The Commons room is adventure and victory. It seems
to say to the student as he walks in over the slate ﬂoor and looks up
th__rough the stone arches, ‘Here is some of the best thinking and
feeling about life from the past. Take them for your own. Then
you make the future.’ ”

Summary of Trustees Report

(Story on Page 1)

Following is a summary of the findings of the seven-man commit-
tee of the Board of Trustees which investigated the lfniversity ad-
ministration :

“In the past 20 years the University has achieved a rapid growth
in enrollment, a remarkable eiilargement and improvement of phys-
ical facilities, and a wide expansion of educational services. The ad-
ministration of the University is to be commended without stint for
its achievements along these lines. The record is one not paralled
by many universities in a comparable period of time. Further, ‘the
ﬁnancial structure of the institution has been kept sound throughout
the period.

“However, the strength of the University in other respects has
not been developed in pace with its growth. The result is that the
University now suffers from an acute case of ‘growing pains ’ That
this should not become a chronic condition, it is now vital that steps
be taken without delay to make the University  sound as it is large.

“Representative symptoms of the imbalance in the development
of the University are tie faulty set-up of its administrative organiza-
tion; the failure to bring all parts of its family into a consultative
partucrsliip for the guidance of the institution; the failure to keep
all parts of its family adequately informed for effective ‘team play’;
the necessity of giving further attention to its library and laboratory
needs, and to club or ‘union’ needs of students during the develop-
ment of the building program; the neglect to establish an official code
of tenure wh.i<:h would give the institution credit for its actual prac-
tices; the failure to engage the cooperation of all interested groups
when changes in athletic policies were being effected; aiul the gen-
erally unsatisfactory nature of its relations with the public press.
There are other symptoms, but these appear to the committee ‘to be
the most important ones.

“The administrations preoccupation with the problem of hous-
ing fhe Universifys growth and of improving the quality of this
housing may lmyc had much to do with the failure to give adequate
atfenton to tliesc matters of adniinistrative policy and management.
However, it is important. now more than ever that attention he "turned
to these matters and that they be dealt with competently if the
ilinivei-sity is to have clear title to the full conﬁdence of all parts of
its official family, to the respect of other educational institutions, and
to the support of the public.

“The committee is thoroughly convinced that the University of
P.lttsburg'h is a ~.,,//,I'y much better institution than some persons scein
to believe. Furfhe';-, its potentialities are immeasurable. It is still
in :1 plastic condition and can be quickly moulded into a leading in-
stitution of higher education if the problems now confronting it are
competently attended to Without delay.

A small group of western Senators,
led by Nye of North Dakota, is rally-

“To stay out of war America must
maintain neutrality,” the chorus runs.

But what kind of “neutrality?”
Are we “neutral” by declaring an
embargo on the shipment of arma-

by the enforcement or this kind"of*
“neutrality” we are partial to the na-

wrong with this kind of “neutrality”
when it is just what the Nazi regime
is praying for. Since the inception of
the Hitler regime, Germany’s arsenals
have been crammed, for, as outlined
in Mein Kampf, she knew what the
future course of history was to be.

ity in money reserves and sea power,

The isolationist Senators contend
that the war’s outcome is not our
concern; that our only problem is to
stay out of a foreign war; that the
“democracies” of Europe are ﬁghting
in an imperialistic conﬂict for mate-
rialistic, even selﬁsh reasons. This
unfortunate logic is doubly danger-
ous: it is an entirely erroneous con-
ception, and threatens our future
safety.

It is-about time “that we abandoned,
our cynical indifference to Europe’s
travail, and recognized this interde-
pendent world for what it is. Like it
or not, under our present economy
America too must “export or die.”
Little as our foreign trade may ap-
pear in comparison to our national
income, it represents the vital mar-
gin of our national economy without
which-—cconom-ieustagnation would re-
sult.

Since the choice must be made be-
tween active or apathetic neutrality,
President Roosevelt proposes a “cash-
and-carry” trade with all comers,
which would in effect keep us safe
at home, free from ﬁnancial involve-
ments, and at the same time aid us
and Europe‘ to keep Hitler "at bay.

President Roosevelt’s policy is a
courageous program of purposeful
action, amid counsels of isolation, in-
difference, and drifting with the tide.

The way for us to keep out of war
is by positive, purposeful action, not
by locking ourselves in a closet and
shouting “Peace, it’s wonderful.”

ulty appointments.”

As a summary of “representative
symptoms of imbalance in the devel-

opment of the university,” the com-
mittee listed:

“Faulty set-up of administrative
organizations; failure to bring all
parts of its family into a consultive
partnership inadequately in-
formed for effective ‘team-play;’
failure to engage co-operation of all
interested groups when changes in
athletic policy were being effected;
and the generally unsatisfactory na-
ture of its relations with the public
press.” Other symptoms noted were
need for further library and labora-
tory facilities. . .

In conclusion, the committee de-
scribed its report as one which
“Stresses criticism more than "com-
mendation. There is much in the
University that is good and
the present administration has given
the University in the past 18 years
or so an advancement exceeding
that-of any comparableperiod in its

away in the sports pages of the dailies last Friday regarding the re-
organization of the faculty committee on athletics. There was noth-

School of Education had replaced?

move which had its inception ' two

some of their many duties. In addi-
tion, the faculty committee, with
members from nearly all divisions
of the University, would be more
nearly representative than the old?
Council.

The three positions which have
just changed hands did not do so ear-
lier simply because it would have
been unfair to the new men to have
turned over the job to them without
having some experienced hands to
help out. In two years, those new

That great bugaboo, public opinion,
was against him and still is, for he
replaced a man who had one of the
greatest, if not the greatest, won and
lost records in the history of the
game. .Wheth'e_r ,public opinion was
right in its estimate of Jock Suther-
land, we will not hazard an opinion,
but that public opinion expected,
actually hoped, that Bowser would
have a poor season and offer a dismal
contrast to the work of the Silent
Scot is, we think, indisputable.

So much for that. The shouting
has quieted. a bit. overpthe summer.
Though still not favorably disposed
toward him, the public seems will-
my to give Bowser a chance to prove
his ability. Consequently, it must
have been considerable of an ordeal
to him to have gone through the past
week, the only chance he has had to
get in somereally stiff practices. In-
stead of getting those practices, he
has been forced to waste most of the
week. Little injuries, just enough
to keep a man out of action, have
plagued keymen. Practice sessions

5 were shot to pieces when large num-

bers of the squad took time off to
register. In addition, the trainer’s
rooms, which were supposed to
have been ﬁnished over the summer,
are not yet ready.

With the cards so stacked against
him, Bowser could be pardoned for a
few grouches. Those grouches

University
  etition  or  

By Bill McE1wain,
Sports Editor
Continuing the trend of “more athletic competition for more
students,” James Hagan, Director of Athletics, has announced that
atxthe close of the present football season all intercollegiate competi-

 

tion for freshman teams will be -discontinued.

Committments previously made with Penn State, Carnegie Tech,
\Vest Virginia, and Kiski Prep prevented the plan from going into
effect immediately, but beginning with 1940, football also will come
under the new setup.

No Athletic De-emphasis

Far from constituting a form of athletic de-emphasis, the move
is expected tobri-ng athletics closer to thestudent body. The usual
time spent on freshman practive will no longer be spent in getting the
best possible ﬁrst and second teams. Instead the entire squad will be
split up into teams without regard for the ability of the respective
players and all the boys on all the teams will be given a chance to
play.

Eventually, a separate intramural league may result. The plan,
Director Hagan believes, should aid the intramural-program in several
ways, the most important being that boys -who would otherwise be in-
tramural stars will be encouraged to go out for freshman squads,
thus making a place in the main intramural program for boys who
are less able athletically but just as anxious to compete.

Carlson Plans Basketball ‘Class’

All freshman squads will continue under the supervision‘ and
tutelage of varsity coaching staffs. The ﬁrst‘ step toward the rear-
rangement has already been taken by head basketball coach Dr.
Clifford Carlson who will conduct a basketball “class” of 50 boys in
the freshman sports program. The class, to begin September 26, will
include all boys who are interested in learning how to play basketball
as well as those who would otherwise have been members of the fresh-
man team.

Another aspect of the plan is that the gap between freshman
and sophomore years may be more easily bridged. Men who haxie
been unable to make the ﬁrst or second teams during their freshman
year frequently consider themselves out of the running for a varsity

position. It is expected that, with all the members of freshman’

squads placed on a comparatively’ equal basis, their turnout as sopho-
more candidates for varsity teams will be considerably greater.

More Time For Study

It is probable, also, that the amount of time spent in practice
will be less than that formerly spent by freshman teams. The pur-
pose of this; Hagan stated, is to give the boys more time for their
studies. '

“The prime aim of the freshman,” he added, “should be to be-
come ﬁrmly established as a Pittustudent, particularly from an aca-

Ends   Intercolleg

 

iate

demic standpoint. If he has plenty of time to study in his ﬁrst year,
the change from high school to college will not be so difficult.” ’

The general attitude of the men most affected by the change,
that is, the coaches, makes the future of the plan seem more than a
little briglit. Coaches Bowser, Olson, Carlson, and intramural di-
rector James Potts all favor the plan.

Olson Favors Plan . _ _

Typical of the reactions was the statement of track coach Carl
Olson who said, “A very ﬁne idea. It ﬁts in very well with the best
‘practices in education. An incoming student has enough problems in
adjusting himself to his new environment without being high-
pressured in freshman athletics.”

More cautious but still favorable in his approach was Dr. Carlson,
who stated, “It will give the boys more of a chance to study. It’s at
least worth a tryout. I wouldn’t want to make a deﬁnite evaluation
of it until after it has been put in effect.”

Five University teams will be affected by the change. Freshman
teams have engaged in intercollegiate warfare in football, basketball,
baseball, track, and tennis. The University has not had freshman
golf and hockey teams. ‘
