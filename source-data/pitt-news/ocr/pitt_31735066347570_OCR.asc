Forty-three-year-old Nardo Be-
rardinelli is Pittsburgh's aerial
advertiser. Short. "gray-haired and
thickly mustachioed. he ShlV€TS in
the cold beside his 1946 Piper Cub.

Nardo's domain is of high
elevation. Eighteen hundred feet
of frost-tormented“runway is
graced by the absence of transistor
boxes. electric wires and telephone
poles.

A century-oldhouse. a dilapidat-
ed barn. a reaper and other ma-
chines stand out against the
blue-skied background of the
Berardinelli’s 75-acre Indiana
township farm.

 
  
 

Suddenly. there is a loud noise.
A grand smile of recognition
envelopes Nardo's face.

-It occurs again. "Squaaaaaak!"

He does an about-face toward
the gray and white farmhouse. a
tall weathered structure with many
windows. 50 or 60 feet to the south.

“Did you see_ that?” Nardo asks
excitedly. '

There is a ﬂutter of feathers on
the porch steps as several ducks
flap their wings.

-"Watch this!" Nardo says.‘
Collar~length hair whips across his
coat shoulders. puffed like weather
balloons. as he scurries toward a
large white bird. It is perched on a
rainwater-filled bathtub beneath
the porch.‘ -

He waves his arms.

“The Muskovie's ‘my favorite
because she flies. You should see
when she takes off and makes a
circle!" _ .

The white duck -shakes its head

nervously. lifts its wings. raises a.

webbed foot from the rim of the
bathtub. then relaxes. _' '

"Aren't you going to ﬂy?" he
coaxes.

The bird stares at him. Nothing

happens.

“You'll see.
minute."'

He waits.

As Nardo watches the Muskovie.
he begins to daydream. He thinks
back—to a Sunday when the
weather was warm and he was
ﬂying over Three Rivers Stadium.
What banner had he been hired to
tow? Was it “Save Our Babies" or
"Get the U.S..Out of the U.N.?"

That afternoon. as on many
others‘ when he had been luxuri-
ously alone above the stadium
crowds. thousands - of squinting
eyes followed his message across
the sky. As usual. the sign was
attached to the plane by a hook;
but. this time. 12 red letters. each
five feetphigh and cut from rayon.
spelled W-E-S-T-I-N-G-
H-O-U-S-E...

A strong south wind rocked the
Cub, but.Nardo pushedthe‘ throttle
forward. easing the plane into a
west-north turn. He recognized the
strength with which a fierce gale
could dash a light’ plane against
Mount Washington's radio tower.
Channel 11's television antenna..
the U.S. Steel Building or any other
urban hazard if a pilot were not
careful. He could see redlights and '
congestion down there.

Nardo was_ not fond ‘of the
city—even though his two busi-
_ness_es. Aerial Ads. Incorporated

and General Cruise Travel Agency.“
’" were located in the‘ Pittsburgh

area. Each weekday. Nardo
traveled to the agency. but the
ﬂying business was pleasurably
reserved for his free, time and
Sundays. '
Nardo had been ﬂying for an
hour; he pressed the microphone
against his‘ lips. “Allegheny
Tower. this is Piper N92274. I am
leaving Three Rivers Stadium for

Nardo's personal-use airport," he A

said. ending his daydream and
returning his thoughts to the
present.

‘ Back at the farm. his eyes widen

- as the Muskovie stretches her

wings. But the bird relaxes again
on its perch.

' “She'll ﬂy." Nardo says patient-
ly. then reflects. “When I was a
kid. I wanted to be a pilot. so I used
to hitch hike to Harrison City
Airport from where my family lived
in Export. ﬁve miles away.

"I got my first airplane~»ride at
seven." he continues. “It cost only’
two dollars. l‘./l_v brother. saw my
interest in models and posters. so
he took me to get a thrill. It was a
thrill?

“At lb. lsoloed. I noticed it was
more exciting when you ﬂew by .
yourself. but the big excitement
was leaving the ground. .

“At 17. lgot my license. I had

- four brothers. one used to ﬂy. and

we'd take girls and relatives up.
With my father. it was a secret.
though. »He was conservative. He
didn't know."

Nardo stuffs his hands in his coat
pockets and gazes into the air. A
soaring hawk swoops’ down in
semi-circles upon the horizon.
Nardo watches with interest as the
bird streaks upward by one strong
pulse of wings to a new height.

“Flying through clouds,” Nardo
says with a smile. “and ﬂying low.
Those are the things I used to do
that you're not supposed to do.

“One time. I putthe plane ina
dive and my safety belt was loose.
so I fell forward from my seat when
I put the nose down. That scared
me for a second! i '

"Then I did 15 loops at one
time. I'm adventuresome.

“But -not a daredevil!" Nardo
explains. “I have a fear of
high—speed highways." He points
toward the horizon where a naked
gray strip. speckled with moving
black dots._ juts upward from a
hillside of trees. —

“The turnpike runs parallel with
the farm." he says. “You can see
it over there.

"Now. I wouldn’t be afraid on a

race track where everyone is in

safety belts and roll bars. but
driving on a highway is a daredevil

‘situation ‘because it depends on

other people's judgment.”

' Nearby. four well-fed Herefords
stand motionless. Nardo walks to
the electric fence. then ‘swings a
bell-bottomed leg to the other side.
A ‘big cow turns its head._ A

“Here. Bessie." he calls. The
fat red cow ambles forward. her hip
bones swaying up and down. The
animal's scent of earth and hay is
carried by the wind. '

Gently. Nardo reaches for the
soft udder of pregnant Bessie. She
unrolls her long pink tongue and
licks the pilot's raincoat affection-
ately.

'‘I like animals. the quiet life,
nature and trees." Nardo says.
“Being on the farm and ﬂying are
the most important things to me. I
like the privacy. When you are in
the air. your scope is 50 fold
Jecause you don't have the
complexity of the city. The farm
has a secluded peace.

“I also bought the farm in Joan's
interest." Nardo says. “She
writes." His wife—tall. thin and
gentle-maiiiiered—is an assistant
English professor at Pitt.

“Joan's precautious about ﬂy-
iiig." he says. “But she tries.
She's getting better." he adds.
proudly recalling the first time he

had taken her for a ride in the
"plane. ‘

They had ﬂown eastward intend-
ing to circle above his family's farm
in Export. At first. Joan was
nervous. but she relaxed and
appeared to enjoy the scenery.

“It was difficult to hear because
of the engine. so I'd point to
something and shout. ‘Can you see
that. Joan?‘ She'd yell back ‘Yes!’
but she wouldn't see it!"

 

Then Nardo began tilting the
wings to the right. tipping them to
the left. and rocking the wings back
and forth. again and again.‘

“Joan shouted. ‘Stop that!
What are you doing?! Stop that!‘
She didn't realize we were over
Export and I was waving to the
relatives." Nardo laughs.

"You should try something first
to see if you like it. If you know the
airplane is safe and if you
understand the ‘theories of aero-
dynamics--—in case there's a
malfunction. there's no fear." ‘

Suddenly. there is a loud noise
accompanied by a flutter of
feathers. “Squaaaaaaaak!" On

 

   

 

her bathtub perch. the Muskovie
extends her wings.
. “She's going to ﬂy." Nardo
whispers. He swings a leg over the
.electric fence.

The Muskovie shakes her head.

Nardo rushes toward her. waving
his arms.

The Muskovie stretches upward.
Then. with wildly ﬂapping wings.
the large white duck rises from its
perch and makes a smooth circle in
the air.

‘Erica Jong

 

  . From ’Saving’ to

BY PATTY TASCAR/ELLA

How to Save Your Own Life
Erica ‘Jong .

Holt, Rinehart and Winston.
310 pages

Erica Jong’s “How.to Save Your

Own Life" could be more accur-
ately retitled “How to Exploit Your
Own Life". The adventures of
Jong’s alterego_-protagonist Isa-
dora Wing read more like a
Jacqueline Susanne blockbuster
with only the names changed than
the neosalingerian prose of her
earlier "Fear of Flying." In fact, a

ﬂip through articles on Jong in ‘

“Time" magazine would give a
condensed version of “How To’s"
plot.

Comparisons with the excellent
“Fear of Flying” are inevitable and
deserved. for “How To” is its

  

theatre

 
 

witless sequel. Sequels rarely work
well outside the Hardy Boys’
realm, however. and this is no
exception. Not only does “How
To" fall short of ﬂying, it doesn't
even get off the ground.

“How To" takes up three years
after “Flying" left off. Isadora has
written‘ an’ “outrageous best-
seller" called “Candida Tells"——a

semi-autobiographical account of‘

her trip to a psychiatrists’
convention in Vienna with psychia-
trist husband Bennett, and her
subsequent traipsing about Europe
with Adrian Goodlove, an existen-
tialist ﬂipside of Freudian Bennett.
In the uproar of publicity that
follows the novel's publication,
lsadora's marriage crumbles rapid-
ly. Bennett confesses to an affair,
which leaves her in shock. She
then goes in for the talk show
circuit, a lesbian affair and orgies.

Pleasant Compromise

BY JIM FARERI

In Flight
George Benson
Warner Bros. Bsk 2983

After the success of “Breezin’,"
the LP which spawned the hit
single “This Masquerade,"
George Benson must have paused
to assess his future as a musician.

 
   

9

-4

Up until “Breezin',’ Benson
was exclusively a jazz guitarist.

seasoned and acclaimed. But the
prospect of huge commercial
success invited him to ‘redeﬁne
himself. ' ' ,
Benson's old and new fans are

looking to his current release, “In .

Flight," to see whether he is going
back to his established career or
following up on “Breezin’." What
they will ﬁnd is a pleasant
compromise.

“In Flight" has six tracks, two of
which are instrumentals. Anyone
who suspects Benson to have gone
commercial is immediately admon-
ished. None of the six are Benson

compositions: ﬁve. like “This
Masquerade." are creative rendi-
tions, while the sixth_is by
Benson’s keyboardist, Ronnie
Foster.

Onereason that Benson does not
write his own songs may be thathe
does so much blending together of
different musical styles. He is
basically merging jazz, disco and
pop under the sway of the Benson
sound. He is a" newcomer to many
of the brands of music he draws
upon, and is wise to use someone

else's songs as a starting point:
especially when the ﬁnal .Benson-
ized -product is so different fromthe
original.

Benson has drawn from the
works of a wide variety of artists.
An enriched version of the old Nat
King Cole hit “Nature Boy"

appears on side one along with an .

epic revision of “The World Is a
Ghetto." In general. Benson's
play is tighter on the shorter
numbers (around five minutes)
while a lengthy effort like
“Ghetto" begins to show signs of
loosing control.

“Gonna Love you More". is the -
‘likely candidate for FM play.-

matching the gliding arrangements
(Continued on Page II)

Exploiting  

After a smattering of conversations  " ’

with friends who pop up‘ for a_

three-page dialogue and magically

disappear for the remainder of the-

book. Isadora heads for thewest
coast.

Enter screenwriter Josh Ace, six
years Isadora’s junior, who pro-
vides the idcal relationship._ After
a -series of lost love letters,
misdirected advice and Isador_a’s
overcoming her distrust of this
utopia, the pair is reunited,
presumably to live happily ever
after. .End of novel, followed by a
series of Jong’s erotic poetry. _

The flaws in “How T0” are all
tooiobvious. Jong does not give a
believable protrait of any character
in the novel. Isadora, as usual, is

Twilight's Last Gleaming
Directed by Robert Aldrich

The recent conviction of a porno
mag publisher has kicked up the old

- controversy about what’s obscene.

Well, here's another installment
for obscenity fans——a new movie
fresh_ from Hollywood with a
big-name cast and at least a

_ moderate budget. “Twilight's Last

Gleaming” is rated R, but mostly
for gratuitous vulgarisms and the
way the camera loves to linger over
bloodied bodies.

Actually, it's the sort of ﬁlm the
Irish Republican Army, Black
September, etc, should love. Yes.
friends, we’ve come to it, a ﬂick
about the joys of terrorism. Really.
No, the terrorist isn’t an Arab or an
Irishman, but All-American hero
Burt Lancaster. .

Oh, but he isn’t like those other

groups who just grab a few hostages ‘

If all that sounds a little unbent,

‘ ‘Twilight’ ’ is the story of one Air
Force general (Lancaster) who has
been sort _of unglued since he did
time in a Vietnam prisoner of war
camp. With the help of some fellow

escaped convicts, he managesto ‘

break into atop secret missile base.

Okay. Well, since our buddy

before being “railroade'd” on. a
murder rap, he knows all the ins and

to cut off the base from outs..

war—if his demands aren’t.,met._

What does he want? Well, the
usual bit, money ($10 million
bucks), safe passage, a hostage (no
less than the President, of course),
and-—-oh, yes—the release of a

American public just couldn't take
its contents. Too upsetting. Oh, the
President (Charles Durning, who
should be ashamed of himself) is,
shocked when he reads the
document and promises to reveal it
sometime. But right now the people
just aren’t ready.

But Lancaster, like all good

demand. After _all, aren’t terrorists

RUSH AND SEGER CONCERTS NEXT WEEK

Complex hard rock with a
message will be the theme of the
‘Toronto’ based Rush’s concert
appearance at the Stanley Theatre
on March 14.

Rush’s last studio album,
“Z112,” was a futuristic concept
piece that told the story of man in
the 21st century ‘forced ‘to live
[without music and governed by a
cruel computer world.

A live album with cuts taken from
all four of their studio albums, “All
the World is a Stage,” is breaking
the band into headliner status all
over North America.

It is a vivid reenactment of what"

guitarist Alex Lifeson, singer/bas-
sist Geddy Lee and drummer Neil
(the Professor) Peart are capable of
creating in the concert setting.

The headliner of the March 15
show at the "Stanley Theatre, Bob
Seger, is a man who has been
knocking around since the mid-60’s
and just now enjoying real
commercial acceptance.

Seger, along with his Silver Bullet ‘

Band, are a«‘ group of no-frills
rockers weaned on the aggressive
Detroit sound.

What, you probably never asked, could be worse than a 6-21 record, such as
that sported by the recently discontinued edition of the Pitt basketball team?

. Ask Charles “Buzz” Ridl, Pitt basketball coach emeritus, the man who retired
two years ago after leading Pitt to two consecutive post-season tournaments, and
he’ll tell you about his first season here, painful though it may be. .

“Al hate to think about it,” said Ridl, now alumni affairs director at Westminster
College, the place from whence he came nine years ago to become Pitt’s head
coach. “We were in our first year, and freshmen couldn’t play so we couldn’t use
the players we’d recruited. As a result we lost some ballgames.” /

Pitt lost 20 times during Ridl’s first season here, and won only four games. But
as every person as optimistic as Tim Grgurich realizes, the only place to go from a

direction taken by Ridl. . .
“We were quite pleased with our
second year,” said Ridl. “We moved
from a very disappointing year to one
where we played .500 ball. We beat
West Virginia in the last game at the old
Mountaineer Field House in our second
year. We played.some good games.
“After that," we became a good team.
Then, as the years went on, we became a
great team (one that advanced to the

led by Billy Knight).f’

Ridl, though a Westminster employe,
is still a Pitt fan, albeit somewhat_of a , BUZZ RIDL
closet rooter. And now, empathizing with Grgurich, he’s pulling for him.

“l’m sure the situation ihe’s facing is very similar to the one I had,” Ridl said.
‘‘It’s shattering...and hard to keep your head up. ' l’m sure he feels his team can

, play with the best teams, and at times, they did. But pulling through timeslike this

is all part ofgrowing up as a coach. . -

“The most important thing to do now is recruit and stay together with your
current team. But now the goal is to add three or four players who can bolster the
team’s game. ' ‘ ‘

“The thing that hurt the team this year was not winning a few of the close games
I Winning a few of the early ones can help out later, in January and

   

February,”.Ridl observed.

team,” he added. ‘‘I’d like to see Pitt
basketball get back to where it’s fun for
the players and for the fans. and where it
puts the_University's name in a light it
deserves. But these things take time.-
“They’re close," he said. “lt’s just a
matter. of taking some of the

more consistently. Then, if you can pull
out a few ofthe early ones, you're on
your way."

TIM GRGURICH

Listening to Buzz Ridl, and remembering the turnaround that occurred under
his reign, almost leadsone to believe that maybe 6-21 isn't the end of the world (or
the program) after all.

Basketball recruiting already?

Though Pitt makes it a practice to wisely refrain from announcing its recruits
before the_v‘ve signed, there is some goodhnews to be had on the incoming-talent
front. '

Probably the most heartening tidings come from Brashear High School, where
6-S strongman Sam Clancy. a third-team All-America selection in one pre-season
high school magazine, reportedly is waiting for a chance to sign on Pitt’s certain-
to-be-offered dotted line. -

Another player Grgurich would like to land is 6-8 Cleveland center James

Pitt wrestlers Skip Bolin, Bill Bailey
and Mark Stepanovich will be among the
125 grapplers from the Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL) who will be going to
Norman, Oklahoma, for the NCAA
Championships March 17-19.

The three Panthers, who helped their
team to a fifth-place finish in the six-
squad league, were almost joined by a
fourth Pitt performer—l26—pounder
‘Jose Martinez—but a vote by ‘the
participating teams coaches gave the
final wild card berth to another wrestler.

‘‘I thought Jose should be selected as a
wild card participant,” Pitt head coach
Dave Adams claimed. “He beat the
second-seeded-guy for third place and
lost only by a 4-2 score to the top-seeded
wrestler.”

But the coaches passed him by, and so
it will be Bolin (I67-pounds), Bailey
(190) and Stepanovich (heavyweight)
who will attend the prestigious event.

Bolin, named the most outstanding
wrestler in the EWL tournament,
remained undefeated this season (17-0)
by sweeping through his weight-class
competition.

5‘The competition there was pretty
he claimed. “Pretty high-'
caliber. Some of the best in the East
were there, like Bloomsburg’s Andy
Cappelli, who was seeded ahead of me.”

Bolin dumped Cappelli for the 167-
pound- championship and hopes for a
shot at All-American status.

“lt’s kind of hard to say how well l’ll
do there,” Bolin said. _“But l’m looking
forward to it. If I have a good seeding,
and good luck, then l’ll do well.” ’

One factor against Bolin is
experience——he doesn't have~any. A
sudden appendicitis attack at the end of
last year kept him, from post-season
competition, so this will be his first time
in the excitement and gala of the finals.

“l’ve heard about the NCAA’s, but
have never seen them,” Bolin dreamed.
“They say the place has room for 16
mats, five mack trucks and can still fit
15,000 people. It has a tendency to make
you choke.”

Stepanovich has been exposed to
finals play—but in a Navy uniform.

‘‘I won my first match,” he recalled of
last year’s experience. “But I. had to
forfeit the next match because I broke.
my foot.” .

Stepanovich had the same luck this
season, sustaining rib injuries towards
the end of the season. As a matter of
fact, his chance of participating in the
EWL tournament was questionable.
Luckily he was able to’ heal in time, for
he took the championship of the
heavyweight class, working his way
through his peers unbeaten.

“lt was tough,”
admitted. “But 1 always dreamed about '
qualifying and winning the Nationals.”

But with rib
possible? _

“l’m going with the intention of
winning,” Stepanovich stated. ‘‘I’m not
going for a free trip. My workouts have
been hard, and as longas my mental.‘
attitude‘ is good, l’ll do well. l’ll be in
tip-top form.” '

One who may not be in top form,‘
however, is Bailey, who had to withdraw
from the final 190-pound bout"in"thev
EML tourney because of aggravated sore.
ribs. 1 i

“We taped them up thinking it’d be
okay,” Bailey explained, “but it wasn’t.
They stopped the match in the first
period.”

Bailey finished second, qualifying for
a playoff slot the third year in a row.
And he hopes the third time is a charm.

“This is my third year at the
NCAA’s,” he said. “I figure this is the
year to do it. .1 think l’ll do well. '1 just

if old injuries don’t haunt any of the

casualty this season—Pitt will be well-
represented in the finals.

Women Ready for Lock

The Pantherette basketball squad
takes on Lock Haven tonight in the
opening round of the Eastern
Association for Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (EAIAW) regional playoffs
in Philadelphia. -

The sixth-seeded. Pantherettes edged
Lock Haven, 77-72, during the regular
season. Paced by guard - Kathy
Paczkowski’s 19 points, Pitt led
throughout most of the game and held
on for the win. However, Lock Haven’s
sharpshooting forward Maureen Brady
hit for 30 points in the contest and may
prove -a big factor in

tonight's »

. confrontation. Also to be considered is

the fact that the earlier meeting was at
_Fitzgerald Field House while Lock.
Haven is hosting this tournament.

The 16 teams in the playoffs are
divided into two brackets with the top
two squads advancing to the national
championships. ' Defending Eastern

champ, Immaculata is seeded first.
followed by Montclair, St. Joseph’s
Cheyney State, Maryland, Pitt,

The Pantherette basketball team will

season. — ‘ '

Head coach Pat Wallace and assistant
coach Jean Balthaser were told Friday
by assistant athletic director for
women’s "sports Sandy Bullman, that
their one-year contracts will not be
renewed for the 1977-78 season_. _

“l have no comment except that we’re
dissatisfied with their coaching,”
Bullman said. She added that there are
no similarities between this and the 1975
dismissal of then head coach Jean
Condo. » ‘ '

an assistant

Wallace, formerly

Pantherette Coaches Axed

defensive coach, took the head slot upon
Condo’s leaving. During her two years
at the Pantherette helm, Wallace
compiled a 34-15 record, including two
years at, the ‘Eastern Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
regional championships.
Prior to coaching at Pitt, Wallace ran up
a 226-31 record at Lancaster Catholic
High School. A

Wallace, in Philadelphia for the
Easterns, was unavailable to discuss the
‘situation. Balthaser refused to
comment. .

Bullman said their successors have yet
to be named.

Wanda Randolph, averaging 21.1 points
per game, is one of the hottest offensive
_ threats in all of women’s basketball.

- “We’ve played, a good, schedule,”
Balthaser pointed out. “We’ve gained
experience and composure.”

However, the Pantherettes have had a
problem with consistency throughout the
season and the turnover rate has been
“terrible," according to head coach Pat
Wallace.

“You can’t let up for a minute in the
Easterns,” Wallace said. “A team like
St. Joe's can capitalize on a few errors
and get so far ahead that it's impossible
to catch them."

One advantage for all teams is that
each will play only one game per day
instead of two. Any teams losing in the

first round will compete in the
consolation championship.

Swingers Wanning Up, Califomia Bound

BY STEVE SYBERT

Though the weather hasn’t been
suitable enough to do anything outside
just yet, the Pitt baseball team has found
its own way of beating those adverse
conditions.

Already with three weeks of indoor
practice under their belts, the Panthers
are preparing to open their I977 season

‘on the west coast as‘the eastern entrant
in the llth annual university of
California at Riverside- National
intercollegiate Baseball Tournament
March 28-April 2.

Finishing with a 6-I0 record last year
and l0-4 two years ago, the Panthers will
make their second ‘appearance in the
eight-team round-robin tournament. in
1968, Pitt finished fifth behind winner
UCLA, which won . the first two
Riverside affairs and returns this year
after posting a 35-25 mark in I976.

Also entered in the tourney are

"Missouri (46-22 last season ), the Big

Eight champions; Washington State (42-
i3), I976 College World Series entrants;
Pacific Eight champions UCLA;
California Bears (33-20), coached b)’
former pro player Jackie Jenson; Oral
Roberts (27-l8); Brigham Young (26-
21); and host California at Riverside (26-
23), the 1975 winners and only NCAA
Division ll team participating.

' “l would have to say that any one of
teams could win the

championship,” said tournament
director Don Edwards. “Certainly
UCLA_has to be considered following a
fine season last year, and Washington
State will want to show Southern
California fans that they are a
championship team. Even though_l have
not seen them play, Missouri’s Tigers
have a strong nucleus from all reports."
But Pitt Coach Bobby Lewis,
beginning his 23rd year at the helm (235-

DON KENNEDY
I65 record), isn't about to.give up just
yet.
“They have a distinct advantage over

us,” Lewis admitted. “Some of the
teams will have played 20 games by the
time we play our‘first. i don’t think
there’s that much difference talent-wise,
but the talent they have has had more
time to mature, especially when you play
ll months out of the year.

  

“But we’re going out there with the
attitude that we have a chance. They
have the advantage, but we have to
overcome it. We’re optimistic. The
fellows are very enthusiastic and have
been working very hard in the gym. i
know we’ll be in shape because we’ve
been doing a lot of running while we’ve
been inside.”

With ll lettermen returning on the 22-
man Pitt squad, the Panthers have a
good chance to improve upon what was
only their second losing season in the last
10 years. Top returnees include senior
first baseman Kurt Leithholf (.353
average), sophomore shortstop Dan
Skinner (.257 and five RBl’s), senior
catchers Dan DeStout (.245, two triples,
six RBl’s) and Val Bianco (.233), junior
second baseman Dan Smodic and senior
outfielder Allen Witkowskii (seven
RBl’s), Mike Bianco (.244) and Dan
Nania.

“We won’t know much ab_Oui the
hitting until we get outside,” Lewis
shrugged. “lt’s hard to tell in the cage
whether you’re hitting the ball well or
not.”

On the mound, Lewis ‘will have senior
veteran Don Kennedy (2.94 ERA and
49 strikeouts in 52 innings) who posted
a 3-5 record last _year after a 3-] slate in
l975. Another senior, Les Qualk, struck
out 20 batters in 24 inningspfinishing
with a 1-2 record. Lewis also feels he has
two outstanding freshmen hurlers in Jim

Boyle and Don Koller, while_ sophomore
Tony Disaia (1-1) is also set‘ for duty.
Outfielder Mel Howard (.333 last
season) is inelligible in l976.

Right now, Lewis is excited about the
prestigious tournament (in- which the
Panthers will play seven times) and the
rest of the 29 scheduled regular—season'
contests.

“They try to ‘get a national

.flavor—we’ve been there twice,” he said

of the«Riverside event. “lt’s not only the
competition that is excellent out there,
but the fields are excellent and the people

are very friendl  lt’s so well-run and
3

organized.”

The Panthers then will return home in

time to open their home schedule with a
single game against Duquesne at Trees
Field on April 4, followed by five home
doubleheaders and four single games
mixed with six road doubleheaders. The
District 2 (Pennsylvania, New York,
-New Jersey and Delaware) Regional
Tournament will take place May 26-28 in
Storrs, Connecticut, with the NCAA
Tournament scheduled for June l0—l7 in
Omaha, Nebraska.

. “It’s hard to say what's going to
happen,” Balthaser admitted. - “In a
tournament, every team has a shot at
winning.” "
Last year, as -the unseeded EAIAW
host team, Pitt was eliminated during the
second round but came through to win
the consolation crown. This year, the
Pantherettes’ aim is higher, especially
after fulfilling their team goal of placing
in the Easterns.

“it was one of our goals to be. A

seeded,” Wallace said. “Accomplishing
that gives us a lot of satisfaction. It gives
us some extra incentive.”

'Wallace is enthusiastic about Pitt’s‘

chances and is focusing much of her
attention on a possible clash with
Edinboro in the third round.

“Mostly it was inexperience that cost
us the game at Edinboro ‘(the Scots
defeated Pitt, 71-66),” Wallace said,
“We made a lot of errors and they
capitalized on them. By the second game
(Pitt pulled off an 87-84 thriller), we
knew better how to handle them.”

While the Pantherette defense is
notably tight, Pitt still has had problems
with teams. that feature a swiftly
executed fast break and excellent outside
shooting. This could prove to be a
deciding factor in the tournament.

' Heck, who placed fifth with a 268 score

Pitt’s “Gold” team of Mike Heck,
Lloyd .Sayman, Steve S_isak and Rob
Yankes captured third ‘place behind’
winning Clarion at the 1977 Western
P~.-nnsylvania- intercollegiate Rifle
league sectional at Trees Hall Range last
Saturday. The Panthers scored 1,037 of
a possible l,200'points. '

Leading the way for Pitt were captain

out of a possible 300, and Sisak, who

shot a 264 score. First place went to

lUP’s Tom Carnahan who tallied a 279.
The sectional is one of the largest in

the country, composed of 18 teams and «
