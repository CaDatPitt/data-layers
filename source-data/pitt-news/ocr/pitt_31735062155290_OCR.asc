Hears Reports

Of Joint Work

‘ Men’s Council met last Wed-
nesday evening and heard re-
ports from three precedent-
setting committees. The
Freshman interest committee,
the Social committee, and the

Blazer committee have all been
working in conjunction with the
corresponding groups of WSGA
for the ﬁrst time this year.

- Phil Parkinson, Col. ’58, chair-
man of the Freshman interest
committee, reported that the com-

I,
-~.

mittee had met twelve times over:

the summer months and that ﬁve
of these meetings were held with
the Customs committee of WSGA.
C One part of the program orig-
inally planned by the joint com-
mittee was the wearing of dinks
for all freshmen. This was ap-
proved by Council in May at the
last meeting. During the summer,
arrangements were made for the
«buying of the dinks by MC for
the freshmen men. Jack Hardman,
advisor to MC, announced to the
committee late in the summer
that such a purchase was impos-
sible since the budget for the MC
committee was inadequate. Be-
cause of this action on the part

of the men, WSGA dropped their

dink program.
Exam For Men
Among the other facets of the
joint program is the Customs
exam which will be given.to
freshmen men and women. The
same exam, worked out by the
joint committees, will be given at
_diﬂ‘ercnt times to accommodate
_,-freshmen schedules. This is the
ﬁrst such exam given to the men
in several years. Material for the
exam was taken from the Polaris
handbook.

THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By ED KOLTISKA

The Panthers provided the
,honey that the Golden Bears
were waiting for in one of the
biggests upsets of the week-
end as the Californians closed
the doors on the Blue and

Gold, 14-0. at Memorial Stadium
last Saturday afternoon.

Coach John Miche1oscn‘s charg-
es, ranked seventh in the nation,
were seven-point favorites before
the game, but_not in the minds
of the Bruins as the Golden Bears
passed for one touchdown and
plunged over from the one for
the second.

Early in the second quarter the
Panthers took a Cal punt on their
own 41 before being charged with
a personal foul that set them back
to the 26-yard line. On the first

from Darrell Lewis for a 13 yard
gain.

Penalties Stop Panthers

Before the ball was set down
again, Panther Captain Joe Wal-
ton was informed of an illegal use
of hands penalty to set the ball
on the 11-yard line.

On the next three plays, the
Blue and Gold moved the pig-
skin up to the 20. On fourth
down, Ralph Jelic punted to the
Bruin 45-yard line where a

Camera Developed
In Four Months;
WQED Uses Now

By ESTHER MISHELEVICH

Movies have a different con-
notation than “What’s playing
downtown?” for Robert Fer-

V ber, Eng. ’57, who.r¢cently de-

signed and developed a new
ﬁlming process in four months.

“Usually, of course, such a
project would take about two
years,” Bob said, “but this was a
rush job.” ~

 The idea behind this project, he
‘/1 explained, was to turn out a 16

millimeter camera utilizing the
advantages of a television camera,
without destroying the purpose of
the TV camera itself.

The result is the Tele-Cam. Ac-
cording to Bob, this combination
movie-TV camera enables a cam-
eraman to know through his view-
ﬁnder exactly what picture he is
taking and to keep his picture in
focus when “dol1ying”' —— moving
toward or away from his subject.

Picture Monitored
Also, the director sees, by means

«of a f‘monitor,” just what picture

the cameraman is ﬁlming and can
plan his directions accordingly.

_Using an ordinary motion picture

camera, such mechanical achieve-
ments are hard=to accomplish and
some are impossible.

This new device, said its de-
signer‘, not only eliminates
guesswork and increases the
quality .of the ﬁlm, but a pro-
gram being “shot” can be broad-
cast over the air televisionwise
at the same time. As for the
ﬁlming itself, no special studio
is needed, and a half hour pro-
gram, ordinarily two days’ worth
of ﬁlming, can now be repro-

uced in the very same half

hour it is seen on the air.

Bob said that such a camera
system had been discussed for
about two years by him and War-
ren Smith of Warren R. Smith,
Inc., the ﬁlm producing and pro-
cessing ﬁrm where Bob works.
There seemed to be no market for
it, however, until early this year,
w h e n. Encyclopedia Britannica
Films, Inc.,
WQED physics series. But they
didn’t have the money for ordi-
nary movie procedures.

Development of Interest

The Britannica people became

interested in the development of

qrthis twofold camera, and in May

\‘of this year, Bob designed the
Tele-Cam. By the ﬁrst of July, he
had begun construction on the
actual units. They are still in ex-

perimental stages, but were shown -

to the Encyclopedia people in op-
eration on Aug. 7. After more re-
ﬁning, the cameras were put into
operation at WQED on Sept. 10.
Carrying such a project
through in 1/6 of the usual
time involved required an in-
tense schedule. Bob noted that
his hours ranged from an aver-
age of 50 to 55 a week in his
work’s earliest stages, to 80 or
90 a week at his busiest times.

""‘-, So the Tele-Cam was born. Now

WQED broadcasts its physics ser-
ies with two of these units, simul-
taneously producing two 16 milli-
meter ﬁlms in color. They are
eventually edited into one motion
picture.
Project Challenging
Bob feels that above all, this
project was “the most challenging
situation” that he has ever met.
‘His interest in this’ camera has not
ended with the designing and

a market now established through-

years.

To Bring Attention
On ‘Family of Man’

The Carnegie Institute, Depart-
ment of Fine Arts will open a
photographic exhibition on “Fa-
mily of Man,” beginning Oct. 19
and continuing through Dec. 2.

“Family of Man” was created
by Edward Steichen, Curator of
Photography at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, where
it attracted more than 27,000 visi-
tors within a period of 15 weeks.
The exhibit will be shown in its
entirety in the third floor galler-
ies of Carnegie Museum.

Steichen has been head of the
photography department of the
Museum of Modern Art since
1947. He_ headed photographic
work for the Army Air Service
in World War I, and Naval Avia-
tion in World War II.

Steichen traveled in eleven
countries and 29 cities in Europe
during 1952 to search for ma-
terial for “The Family of Man”
and has personally arranged for
showing of the exhibition in
Japan, Berlin, Amsterdam, Mu-
nich, Paris, and London, as well
as its original appearance at the
Museum of Modern Art.

Transfers To Dine

Miss Helen Poole Rush, Dean of
Women, and the Transfer Com-
mittee have issued invitations to
175 transfer students to attend-ra
dinner which will be given Octo-
ber 11. The purpose of the dinner
is to help these students from
other colleges become a part of
Pitt and ﬁt into the life of the
University as quickly as possible.

Rushintg Hits Last
Phase Before Bids

A change in fraternity rushing
from the informal rushing for get-
acquainted purposes to formal
rushing for closer acquaintance
began on October 1.

After a week of casual ac-
quaintance, the rushees now ex-
perience the closer relationships
of formal rushing which include
tea dances with sororities, house
dances, large formal affairs and
hayrides. This will continue until
Saturday,‘Oct.‘12, when the ﬁnal
rush affair will be held.

On Oct. 15 and 16, men can pick
up. their bid cards on the eighth
floor. '

Men not contacted by fraterni-
ties about rushing and who would
like to be rushed are asked to
see Don Military, Dean of Men's
Office, 801 C1. '

[.S'tmIent   - Faculty

The announcement in last Monday’s Pitt News that the
YMCA and YWCA are ‘setting out to establish an expanded
student-faculty relations program comes as welcome news.
Pitt has long felt the need for such a student-faculty ar-
rangement,“ probably even more than other schools due to
its large number of commuting students and consequently
small number of campus students. The program is being-
planned, however, with Pitt as a campus school in mind.
It is hoped that the discussion series will be ﬁrmly estab-
lished by the time the new dormitories for both students
and faculty are ready. It should be an easy transition then
from the “professor’s—home” plan. to the “faculty—dorm”
idea. ‘

The present arrangement is to have students meet
at the homes of the professors living within their district.
The meetings would take place approximately once a month
with the topics ranging from student problems to religion

~ and personal hobbies of the professors.

The leaders. of the new system hope to accomplish two
things: ﬁrst, to fulﬁll the need for a closer personal rela-
tionship between the student and his professor and second,
to maintain this relationship throughout the year with con-
tinued discussions.

The program is open to all undergraduates. Students are
asked to show their interest by leaving their name in the
YMCA or YWCA oﬁice. It shouldn’t take much urging for
a large number of students to join the program. Anyone

Instant Poetry

By Barbara Cherington

Several days ago medical student A. Hartley
Saxon wrote a column in which he wondered,
“What is to be the "future of poetry at Pitt?” In
answer, I say, “Whatever Pitt students want it
to be!” ,

In his column, Saxonsaid “teachers are re-
luctant to conduct a verse-writing class” He said
also, “Those teachers who are '
willing to read student verse and
give valid criticism are not so
readily encountered at Pitt.”

If: enough students believed
as Mr. Saxon did, and if they
were willing to work for hav-
more poetry classes, there would
be more. Still, Dr. W. George
Crouch, head of the department
has said, “to encourage the cre— .
ative in students is cl.ose to the hearts of every
English teacher.”

 

‘ Poets Are Few

However, it has been observed by the depart-
ment, the number of students interested in regis-
tering for a poetry course is small.

Student disinterest in poetry is due, «I believe,
to two attitudes. First, students think study of
poetry through the works of great writers is the
best teacher of verse writing. Dr. Crouch has re-
ferred to the “touch stones of great poetry to

The other reason more students aren’t inter-
ested in taking a class in poetry, is, I believe,
linked with the general type of people at this Uni-
versity; Here we have a magniﬁcent conglomera-
tion of pre-dentists, doctors, lawyers, engineers,
nurses, businessmen, and those in many other pro-

fessions. For them, taking poetry would be as
sane as learning about the price of igloos in India.

Prose Helps Diagnose

Certainly it would enrich them to spend several
months with the “highest point of literary achieve-
ment.” But why not suggest that they take, in-
stead, exposition, narration and description? For
these might inspire creativity as well as help
make the diagnosis and business reports clear.
Why not suggest a course in short story writing
or essay writing? There are high points of literary
achievement, too.‘ And certainly there is no ob-
stacle to verse writing if a student so~wishes.

Besides these possible prose, poetry, and litera-
ture courses and individual conferences, there is
another outet for the “forgotten poet” whom Mr.
Saxon laments. A group, formerly called the
“Humanities Society” meets regularly to read and

discuss poetry of the English and other languages. A

(A meeting is to be held in the next two weeks.)
Finally, and most important, the true poet is
not forgotten. Verse will sprout from his heart
and soul if he takes Poetry 387 or Chemistry 1!

Important Farm Crop . . .

By Irv Rotluman

A cartoon in the newspaper
recently depicted a farmer talk-
ing to a couple who were ob-
viously lost and seeking direc-
tions. Replied the farmer “Dunno
’f,I can. You ‘
folks Demo-
crats or -Re-
publicans?”

The carica-
turist is able
to joke about
the problem
that Eisen-
hower‘ has
striven ~hard-
est to remedy
and which has
meant noth-
ing to the President but frustra-
tion. For the administration has
found it virtually impossible to
stem the tide of .-falling farm in-
come which started after the
all-time high in 1948. '

From a peak of almost $16
million in 1948, $12 million in
1950 and almost $15 million dur-
ing the Korean war, farm in-
come dropped to $10,770,000 last
year; according to estimates, the
present year will end at $10,-
330,000.

The Farmers‘ Dilemma

But the surplus will continue
“despite soil bank plans and par-
ity to equalize low production
because of American technology.
Although farmers have reduced
their acreage and have been paid
to reduce it, modern farming
methods enable them to grow as
much if not more crops on the
smaller acreage than they did on
the larger.

In addition the record world

output by foreign markets has
tended to reduce American sales
abroad. So there poses another
difﬁcult problem for the farmer.

Surpluses due to foreign crops

and American tech'nolo.gy haunt '

Eisenhower and will undoubted-
ly provide no end of difficulty
for the Democrats should they
win the,November election.

There is a good chance that
the farm vote will go to the
Democrats. who have pledged
90% parity; and although the
far range problem will not be
solved, the Democrats will pro-
vide immediate relief for the
farmer.

The administration has been
faced with the problem of re-
ducing heavy farm surpluses and
at the same time maintaining
suitable markets for the farmer.
According to Mr. Eisenhower “In
a free agriculture farmers attain

 

The Political Plum

that kind of parity (full parity)
in the market place” on their
own initiative and according to
laws of supply and demand.’

Agricultural Adjustment

The unbiased Twentieth.Cen-
tury Fund in a recent non-par-
tisan report on aid to agriculture
offered the following practical
statement: “ . . . Farmers will
eventually ﬁnd it necessary to
adjust their output to amounts
the market will absorb at‘ prices
they are willing to accept. Gov-
ernmental accumulation of
stocks, with no longer-term ob-
jective than that of taking them
off the farmers’ hands cannot be
continued for very long . . . ”

The words sound logical. But
how about putting them‘ into

‘practice? Stated one farmer re-

cently, “I’ve done more "reading
lately than ever before. I’ve read
that the consumer paid just as
much for pork when the price
dropped and that the packers
never made so many millions.”
Embittered, he claimed Benson

niques, perhaps. But the inspiration is within him-

could have stopped it.

A Middleman Road

Maybe so. Probably the mid-
dlemenmust be controlled; pos-
sibly an office of price stabiliza-
tion on farm/products must be-
established. Otherwise few farm-
ers can risk low production for-
risk of low income. And the
answer certainly is not reduction

of the farm population for better  ~

distribution of income over those
who remain.

The farm vote is the big po-
litical plum this year. Neither
party will risk losing itby ad-
vocating less than rigid price

We have an idea that the party
that can assure the farmer proﬁts

. on their crops equal to the proﬁts

the middlemen carry away will
have- both the farmer vote and
the answer to the farm problem.
We don’t have it.

 

Lettersto the Editor 

' Editor, the Pitt News: a

The members of the English
Department have.read with in-
terest Mr. A. Hartley Saxon’s

column, “Poetry Slighted Here,” ‘

printed in the Monday, Oct. 1,
issue of the Pitt News. As chair-
man of the Department, ‘I wish
to comment brieﬂy on Mr. Sax-
on’s remarks in behalf of my
colleagues. _, , - ‘I

We are pleased that Mr.‘ Saxon
is so much concerned about
the writing ‘of poetry that he
would like to have the English
Department offer a special course
in this subject. Perhaps his stress
on the importance ‘of poetry in
our time’ will serve to stimulate
Pitt students to do more reading
of great poetry, and as a conse-
quence to attempt writing verse
of their own.

Mr. Saxon laments that the
writing of poetry has been “com-
pletely ignored” in the writing
program..There are a few facts
regarding this activity that he
has overlooked. One of our most
capable teachers, Dr. Charles
Crow, did offer a course in verse
writing for two years. So few
Pitt students were interested that
the course had to be dropped. If
there is now “a list . . . of those
who would be interested in a
verse—writing course,” I should
like to examineit. If the num-

   

ber of students warrants the re-
establishment of the course, I
shall be glad to discuss the pos-

sibility with our departmental ._

committee. ‘

Meanwhile, any student. who '"

would like to submit his poetry
to members of the English De-
partment for V critical appraisal »

will be welcomed. Both Prof_es- ’
sors Edwin Peterson and Law...’

rence Lee have-had their poetry

published. They know the ,tech- 
niques of, poetry, and would be ”

glad to help aspiring poets in the
University. Other senior_ profes-
sors. who ‘teach poetry courses
are also available for such guid-
ance.~In all courses in advanced
writing, students may submit
verse as well as prose to their
professors. .
Contrary to Mr. Saxon’s as-
sertion, the writing of poetry has
always been considered a worthy
subject for discussion by our
English teachers. All of us wish
that more students would be-
come interested in the subject
and bring honor to the Univer-
sity by having their verse pub-

Neither will solve the“

lished. We join with Mr. Saxon, '

in hoping that a vigorous poetic

On European Tour
(Editor’s Note--This is the
fifth in a series of articles on

student trips to Europe.)
By IRV JACOBS

Traveling abroad was a
series of strange feelings for
Susanna Biddle, ﬁrst recipient
of the new French Award.

“In traveling alone abroad,
perhaps the first feeling you

become aware of is that you-——not
e Europeans—are ‘different’,”
:he reported. From the day her

,,,...,..ship, the Ile de France, landed,

Sue got used to being questioned
about America.
Five Countries Visited
However, her travels, which in-

‘ cluded visits to England, Scotland,
Switzerland, and Italy, in addition ,

to a month’s stay and study in

, France, were strange for reasons

other than the fact that she was
an American in a foreign coun-
try. . . .
On a tour of Edinburgh Castle,
she wandered away! from the guide
, and eventually wound up ‘locked
‘in an “interesting” display room
with only a taxidermized dog (not
unlike the one of RCA fame) and
a kilt for «companionship. This
brief panic lasted a half hour be-
fore one of the guides discovered
and rescued her.

A much shorter but perhaps
longer remembered chill oc-
curred in her ﬂight from Eng-
land to France. “ Suddenly, over
the English Channel, she found
herself lying on the ceiling of
the plane, listening to an order
over the PA. system: “Please
fasten your safety belts.”

The plane had run into a freak
storm and overturned. Later when

...-"""-VI/'lll’lgS had ﬁnally been righted,

the passengers were informed of
their narrow escape from a swim
in the channel, for the plane had
come within 150 feet of the sur-
face of the choppy waves. .
Watery Fate

But Sue’s fate had destined to
get her into water somehow. A
month later, in a visit to Venice,
she duplicated Katherine Hep-
burn’s feat in the movie “Sum-
mertime” by "falling into one of

those canal—streets while getting‘.

out of a “vehicle.” The gondoliers,
apparently accustomed to such

‘- Deans’ Association

To Hold Luncheon

Mrs.’ Milligan, assistant dean of
‘women, announced the Western
Pennsylvania Association of We-
men Deans, Counselors and Per-
sonnel Workers will hold a
luncheon in the Vira Heinz Room
on October 12. The organization
was formerly known as the Na-
tional Association of Deans "of
Women, but was changed to clear-
ly show that personnel -from in-

' dustry and high-school counselors

belonged to it. -
, Mrs. Milligan, president of the

leaders work along with industry,

. they "will greatly, help students in

their“ vocations and in part-time

selors are able to prepare high-
school students for college.

Miss Helen Poole Rush, dean
of women, will speak by request
on “Personal Programs for Wo-

ing will be held at the luncheon.

A misconception concerning
Spouse and Date tickets is that
the numbers on these tickets

,_VFirst French Awardee Reports Trip

 

TRAVELLER abroad this past summer was Susanna Biddle, ﬁrst
recipient of the French Award. Here she is shown comparing
the architecture of the Cathedral of Learning with the architec-
ture of many of the building she visited in Europe. Sue traveled
through ﬁve countries in Europe and studied French art and
language at the Eucole du Louvre and the Alliance Francaise in

Paris.

traffic mishaps, quickly restored Alliances Francaise. The most ex-

her to the sidewalk.

In other parts of Italy, though,
Su/e found the transportation
equally disturbing. Motorcycles
are the rage now, and if they don’t
kill you, “they’ll sweep you off
your feet,” she discovered. One
day a friendly passing motorcy-
clist picked her up on the run
and carried her along for a dis-
tance.

But Sue’s trip was not only
confined’ to secular unusualities.
She had gone over, primarily to
study architecture. In her trav-
els she had occasion to see the
four famous English cathedrals,
at Ely, Lincoln, York, and ‘Dur-
ham. In Italyrshe visited Milan
Cathedral, which she describes
as “the most exotic of them all.”

Living in Paris ‘during the
month of July, Sue enrolled in
French art and language courses

I

citing feature of h_er study there
was that “You are able to see in
actuality what you are studying.”
The European setting, with its ex-
tensive skyline "of architectural
style from every age, gave her an
excellent chance “to see the his-
tory of architecture come alive.”
Memories of Home

But amid the strangeness of
another country, Sue also had in-
stances with reminders of home.
Her tour of the St. Chapelle in
Paris, from which our own Heinz
Chapel is modeled was one such
case. “I could picture the exact
place I’d be sitting in had it been
the'Heinz Chapel,” she remarked.

But perhaps the greatest feel-
ing was living with a French
family during her Paris stay. “The

French are very warm, with close?

family ties,” she observed. “It was
a wonderful, ‘feeling’ getting to

at the Ecole du Louvre and the,know them.”

FREUD FRAUD?

' Jim was so conceited that he
had cold lips from .kissing_
mirrors. Until one day he
asked himself, “Am I truly
superior? Do not girls turn
me down daily? Twice on holi-
days? Am I not, in actuality,
profoundly inferior?”

So he decided to consult
the famous psychiatrist, Dr.
Hy Pertensive. “My boy,”
said Pertensive, “your Rohr-
schach test shows you are going
batty from collar wrinklosis.
It is incurable. In fact, you are
incurable. Nothing I can do’
for you. $10, please.”

- Then Jim read an ad for a
Van Heusen Century Shirt. He
read how its soft collar 'won’t
wrinkle ever . . . how you can

maltreat it ‘like a maniac and
it still won’t wrinkle . . . h.ow
without _a bit of starch it’s
impossible to wrinkle it. “Gee
whiz, I am saved,” said Jim,
and he ran to his haberdasher
to buy one. “$3.95 please,”
said the clerk.

Today Jim is as popular as
money. And he still has his
Van Heusen Century shirt be-
cause it lasts twice as long as
ordinary shirts.

THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY SIGAFOOS

It was a dullish evening at the Theta house. Mary
Ellen Krumbald was sticking pins in an eﬂigy of the house
mother; Evelyn Zinsmaster was welding a manhole cover
to her charm bracelet; Algelica McKeesport was writing
a letter to Elvis Presley in blood. Like I say,. it was a
dullish evening.

Suddenly Dolores Vladnay stood up and stamped her A

foot. “Chaps,” she said to her sorors, “this is too yawn-
making! Let’s do something gay and mad and wild and
different and gasp-making. Anybody got an idea?”

“No,” said the sorors, shaking their little sausage
curls. —

“Think, chaps, think !”.said Dolores and passed Philip
Morris Cigarettes to everybody, and if there ever was a
thinrk-making smoke, it is today’s fresh and ‘zestful and
yummy Philip Morris. Things come clear when you puff
a good, clean, natural Philip Morris — knots untie, dilem-
mas dissolve, problems evaporate, cobwebs vanish, fog
disperses, and the benevolent sun pours radiance on a new
and dewy world. Oh, happy world! Oh, Philip Morris!
Oh, regular! Oh, long-size! Oh, ‘get some already!

  

“ One. two, 772/236, ”

Now Geraldine Quidnunc, her drooping 'brain-cells
revivified by a good Philip Morris, leapt up and

cried, “Oh, I have a perfect gasser of an idea! Let’s I

hypnotize somebody!” ’
“Oh, capital!” cried the sorors. “Oh, tingle-making !”
. “Yes,” said Dolores Vladnay, “it is a splendid idea,
but hypnosis requires a pliant and malleable mind, and
we are all so strong and well-adjusted.” -
At this point, in walked a young pledge named Alic
Bluegown. “Excuse me, mistresses,” said she, “I— have
ﬁnished making your beds, doing your homework, and
ironing your pleats. Will there be anything else?”
“Yes,” snapped Dolores Vladnay. “Whenl count to
three, you will be hypnotized.” '
“Yes, excel1ency,” said Alice, bobbing a curtsey.
“One, two, three,” said Dolores.
Alice promptly went into a trance. ~

“Go back,” said Dolores. “Go back to your ﬁfth birth-
-day, back to your birth, to before your birth, to your last

incarnation. . . . Now, who are you?” -
"My name is Bridey Sigafoos,” said Alice. "The year
is 1818, and I am in County Cork.”
“Coo!” said the sorors. '
“How old are you?” asked Dolores.
“I am seven,” said Alice. .
“Where is your mother?” asked Dolores.
“She got sold at the fair last year.”
“Coo!” said the sorors.
“Tell us about yourself,” said Dolores. ‘
“I am ﬁve feet tall,” said Alice. “I have brown eyes,
and weigh 3200 pounds.” “~‘
“Coo!” said the sorors.
“Isn’t that rather heavy for a girl?” said Dolores.

“Who’s a girl?” said Alice. “I’m a black and white
guernsey.”

“Coo!” said the scrors. '
“Moo!” said Bridey Sigafoos.

Joe Contestabile, handling the
quarter-backing for the Bruins,
moved the ball from his own 20.
to the 32-yard line before being
thrown for a loss to the 19 by
Walton and Bob Pollock.

The Panthers made their closest
goaline drive on the next series
of plays. Corny Salvaterra hand-
ed off to Jim Theodore for 11
yards. After a roll out by Salva-
terra picked up one yard. Jen‘
kins drove up the middle for
eight. Theodore then picked up

‘ ﬁve yards and a ﬁrst down.

It loked as if the Blue and
Gold were ready to roll. Salva-
terra on a roll out picked up one
yard and Jenkins was stopped on
the 38 after a three yard gain.

Tl\eodore’s Gain Nulliﬁed

On the next handoff, Theodore

ran over the right side to the
Bear 15-yard line. Here the Pan-
thers ran into bad luck again. A
15 yard penalty was called and
the Blue and Gold was set back
to the 42-yard line to end their
closest threat.

Late in the third period, the
Bears started another drive to-
ward the Panther goal. Joe

for 14 yards to left half Darrell
Roberts and then to Bill Vallo-

for pass protection, Jackson on a
draw play ran the ball from the
26 to the one-yard line before be-
ing knocked out of bounds by
Lewis. Jackson then plunged over
for the touchdown with Roberts
converting to make the score 14-0.

In the ﬁnal stanza, sophomore
Bill Kaliden made a fruitful bid
for a score with two ten-yard

Frosl:Soccer
Team Started

Keeping in step with other
Panther sports, soccer is rapidly
moving up in the popularity ﬁeld.
Thus for the ﬁrst time a full
freshman soccer schedule has
been set up.

Games have been arranged with
the Slippery Rock frosh, Shady
Side Academy, Kiski Prep, WPSD,
and the varsity. The ﬁrst year
men have already had two meets,
showing great promise in both.
They tied WPSD, 2-2, and also
came out on an even keel with
their upperclassmen, the varsity,
1-1. ‘

Coach Leo Bemis overflows
with enthusiasm when he talks
about his yearlings. He says, “This
is the best freshman group I’ve

had. They have possibilities of

being real good.” Not stopping
there, he adds, “The fellows really
love it, and they're out there even
with the schedule‘ difficulties they
have." ‘

In all, 24 boys are on the squad.

The PITT NEWS Yogis fell
by the wayside Saturday as they
experienced their worst week-
end of the season. _

The only Seer to get above
the .500 mark was Butchock,
And he got there by picking the
underdogs to come through, not
because of his predicting abil-
' ity.

The ﬁnal slate for the week-
end shows “Hefferle, Koltiska,

guest Bob Pollock (He’s a tackle

Butchok’s score was a respecta-
ble 7-3. A » ‘ .

Even old Consensus couldn’t
edge above the .500 mark as the
Kid was right on only ﬁve of
them.

What helped Butchock to his
7-3 mark was his scientiﬁc
analysis of the Millsaps Majors
to trounce the Sewanee Tigers
in the “Game of the Weak.” Of
course he made the prediction
only after learning that the
Tigers had changed their names.

This brought about a
NWWWA ban that made the en-
tire ﬁrst unit ineligible. Conse-
quently they changed their
name to U. of South and lost to
the Saps, 13-7.

Injuries Plagl‘-ue Locals
For Stadium Inaugural

BY MURRAY CHASS ’ ‘
A somewhat crippled Panther soccer team will try to
get off on the right foot at home tomorrow, something they
could not do on the road, as they meet Lock Haven at- the

Stadium at 3 p.m. If it rains,
to Kennard Field, the original

the meet will be transferred
site. 1 ‘ ‘

The Bald Eagles, coached by Dr. Dan Corbin, have been

described as “a good tricky ball’
team with good ball handling and
plenty of speed.” They are also
reported to be in top physical
condition, an outstanding neces-
sity of t h i s

These facts,
along with the
minor injuries
incurred by the
local booters at
Slippery Rock,
c o u l d mean
that Leo Bemis’
charges are in
f or a rough

play.

Two key players who may not
be ready for tomorrow’s tussle are
Mike Culhane and Jerry Bren
sanelli. Culhane still has a touch
of the flu, the thing that kept him
out of the opener on Saturday.

“That’s right,” Petro answered.
“They sit up in the stands and
brag to their girls about what
they could do if they were down
there, but they don’t have the guts
to prove it.” )

“It seems ‘like only the little
guys want to play football,” back-
ﬁeld coach Rudy Mattioli said
with a smile.

Petro replied, “That’s no joke,
Rudy. You know, we have a boy
125 pounds out for the team,
and a lot of the backs aren’t
a heck of a lot bigger. And
every day I see these big men,
over 200 pounds, wandering
around the Cathedral. They
must think it’s too late to go
out for the team. Man, that’s a
lot of nonsense. Nobody’s won a_
deﬁnite spot on this team yet.
Every position is wide open.”

Steve stood up and began hang-
ing his street clothes in the lock-
er. “We have a lot of backs —— in
fact 60 per-cent of the boys out
are backs. But we need some more
linemen; some more big linemen."

Rockets Tie Panthers

It is ironic that the Panthers
even have to worry about tomor--
row’s game because according to
Coach Bemis, “I picked them to
ﬁll out our schedule, but then a
few weeks ago I found out h0\
tough they really are.” _ -

As for the Blue and Gold’s
chances, Bemis says. “Lock
Haven will have one thought in

mind and :that is to‘ beat"us since \,__,‘

we are the only big school on
their schedule. To overcome this
phychological advantage, our
fellows will have to be up—the
passing must be sharp and our
defense tight.”

But for 15 seconds the Panther
booters would have come back
from Slippery Rock on Saturday
with their ﬁrst victory instead of
a tie, 1-1. It was in these ﬁnal 15
seconds that the Rockets salvaged
the tie. Jack J arvie tallied the all-
important goal for the hosts on a
high shot that goalie Ben Cheshel-
ski just missed knocking down.

‘From then on the Rockets put

Bemis had some high praise
for Paul’ Griffiths, a senior who
took over for the bed-ridden
Culhane at the vital center
fullback spot. “If Griﬂiths had
not played the defensive game

“Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Pappy!
Happy birthday to you,” sang the crowd of approximately
3,000 Californians as Coach Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf and his
star end, Norm Becker, stood on a platform about 15 feet
above the crowd and received the plaudits of the jubilant
Cal fans. Judging from this we would probably be correct
in assuming that the aging, affable mentor of the Golden
Bears had just received the most exquisite gift he could
_have hoped for—an upset win over the favored Panthers.

Cal tagged this game as the “make” or “break” tilt on their

schedule because they felt Pappy’s gridders would be demoralized '

for the season if they lost to the Blue and Gold after suffering
heartbreaking setbacks to Baylor (7-6) and Illinois (32-20). They
were out to win and did exactly that; running over the Blue and
Gold as if they.were a ﬁve touchdown favorite.

There could be any number of excuses for the locals’ im-
potent performance, the most realistic being we were literally
played off our feet by the aggressive Cal line and a passing at-
tack that completely befuddled the Panther secondary. ,

“Words can’t describe how I feel. We played our best ball in
three years. We just kept the pressure on all the way,” offered
the silver-haired Waldorf. Then Waldorf added, “Our defense was
the key ‘to the win and we didn’t make .a mistake. You saw
football today the way it should be played. We showed that we can

‘(play tough football and hang in there for a full 60 minutes.”

Waldorf was greatly impressed by the stamina of his monstrous
line which averaged 217 pounds per man. The Cal line, though big,
had a lazy sign hung on it after losses to Baylor and Illinois. “Any
time you can be fresher than Pitt in the fourth quarter you have
accomplished something. ' ‘

“Pitt is not overated. They are a g_ood, sound team. Those
Pitt backs were awful hard to stop. Our gaining only ﬁve yeards
in the first half is not a reflection on California but a‘ tribute
to Pittsburgh,” explained Pappy. ' ‘ '

And if Pittsburghers think the Panthers are using a simon pure
split-T, they are mistaken; at least that’s the conclusion one can
draw from Pappy who emphasized “Pitt is a power team. They
have only a few maneuvers from the split-T. They don’t emphasize
passing as we do here on the West Coast.”

This emphasis on passing by the Golden Bears made their at-
tack function that much more smoothly. Instead of battering into

/“the line, they utilized their chief offensive weapon——passes——to gain

the victory. Even the third string quarterback, Joe Kapp, hit 8
of 10, with Gus Gianulias connecting on 7 of 14 and Joe Contestabile
completing 5 of 8 before Kapp entered the game. < ,

The only bright spot for the Panthers was the play of
sophomore Bill Kaliden of Homestead. The six foot, 185-pound
soph entered the contest midway during the ﬁnal period after
Corny Salvaterra and Darrell Lewis failed to m'ove the Oak-
landers within striking distance of the Bruins.

Kaliden took over on the Panther 15-yard line and generated
the most sustained drive of the game—72 yards to the Cal 13 before
a pass interception‘ halted the drive. Included was ‘a 19 yard jaunt
that leaves nothing but optimism for the Panther quarterbacking
in the next two seasons.

If, you wnat a ﬂashy signal-caller, Kaliden will be the man.
He’s a good ball handler and the general consensus of opinion is he

.,,.h’as the natural ability to develop into a top-notch signal caller.

<r")\ V

All Kaliden seems to need is experience. The remarkable thing
about Kaliden in his first varsity appearance was the poise he dis-
played with that big Cal wall rushing him on every play. Maybe
Kaliden can even inspire the Panthers to a more successful season
than last year. All he needs is a chance. I

Phi Eps Triumph, 32-0
Over Pi Lambs in IF

Sparked by the running of Herb Kravitz, Phi Epsilon Pi
crushed Pi Lambda Phi, 32-0, as the Inter-Fraternity Foot-
ball League got under way.

The game was characterized by I

hard blocking and “tabbing” by
both sides, and although there

15 yards and the touchdown.

In the second quarter they tal-
lied again as Kravitz raced ten
yards up the middle for the score.
Lee Goodman ran around right
end for the extra point and Phi

Later in the third period a

brought the ball inside the Pi
Lamb ten-yard line. Two run-
ning plays failed and on third
down Lee Goodman passed to
Kravitz for the Phi Eps’ fourth
touchdown. Goodman slipped
trying to make the point after
just as the third quarter ended.

Leading 26-0, the Phi Eps put
in their subs as the fourth quarter
began. . The Pi Lambs ﬁnally
started to move. Led by Dick Sie-
gal‘s passing, they crossed deep
into Phi Ep territory only to be
stopped by an intercepted pass.

Harriers Keep Winning Ways

By MICHAEL GERBER

Saturday, which proved a nightmare for Panther sports
fans, was successful in at least one respect as the Blue and
Gold cross—country team continued its winning ways. The
Panther harriers captured a closely contested triangular meet
from Navy and Villanova at Annapolis. The score was Pitt
34, Villanova 37 and Navy 59.

Team strength and an outstand-¢
ing effort by sophomore Vinnie
Timon were the instrumental fac-
tors in the locals’ win. '

The Panthers, meanwhile, plac-
ed all seven of their runners

seriously.

The Panthers, who avenged
last y'ear’s defeat by this very
same “Villanova team, came up
with a truly‘remarkable per-
formance. Sophomore
Timon, who undoubtedly will-
develop into one of the country’s
top cross-country runners‘ be-
fore he is through, gave Ron
Delaney, of international fame
and a member of Irelandfs
Olympic team, a battle he will
long remember.

Villanova’s top trio of Delaney,
Breckenridge, and Kopil took oﬁ?
together in an effort to literally

Vinnie '

As They Edge Navy, Villanova

run Timon into the grouni. Tim-
on, however, stayed with the three
all the way, and at about the
three-mile mark Breckenridge
and Kopil began to drop off.
With both Timon and Delaney
sprinting the few remaining yards,
the latter pulled ahead at the tape
to ﬁnish one step ahead of the

‘game Timon. Delaney’s time for

the course of slightly over four
miles was a very good 20:50,
while Timon ﬁnished in 20:51..

Following Delaney and Timon
to the ﬁnish were Breckenridge
and Kopil of Villanova and Walt
Meukow of Navy. Pitt, however
had six of the next eight ﬁnish-
ers, thus giving them the vic-
tory. Thornton Smith, Jimmy
Moore, and John Christof were
6th, 7th, and 8th respectively,
while Wendell Harford, Tom
Jessup, and Dale Fauser were
11th, 12th, and 13th in that or-
der. ‘

ENGINEERING
GRADUATES

Seventeen commercial and military models of aircraft are in
production at Lockheed.

Development projects are even more diversiﬁed, include

jet and propjet transports, ﬁghters and bombers far exceeding
present-day planes in performance, radar search planes,
nuclear applications to aircraft and a number of signiﬁcant
classiﬁed activities.

This capacity to develop and produce such a wide range of
aircraft is important to career-conscious engineers. It means
more scope for your ability, more opportunity for promotion
with so many projects in motion. It means more security-—
because your career is. not restricted to one type of plane.

Any students who wish to do
student teaching during the

tion and his application for
student teaching at the same
time.
