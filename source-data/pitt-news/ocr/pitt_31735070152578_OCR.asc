Pitt researcher
awarded grant

Mahita Gaj anan
Assistant News Editor

The National Institutes of Health renewed a
$2 million grant for Patrick Moore, director
of the Molecular Virology Program at Pitt, on
March 5. The renewalwill allow Moore and his

P colleagues to continue research into the new-

est human cancer Virus causing most Merkel
cell carcinomas, arare but deadly skin cancer.

According to UPMC’s website, Moore
and Co—Director of the Molecular Virology
Program Yuan Chang work with a team of
researchers to link viruses to cancer.

In 2008, the team discovered the Merkel
cell polyomavirus — the seventh human can-
cer virus identiﬁed and the second discovered
by the team—— under the original grant, which
expires March 31.

The grant renewal will fund the group’s
research until March 2019.

According to the UPMC news release,
Moore said the "work done through the initial
grantwas successﬁil and led to new methods
for doctors to diagnose and treat Merkel cell
carcinoma.

Among the program’s discoveries was a
protein that allows the normally harmless
polyomavirus to transform healthy cells into
cancerous cells. In the news release, Chang
said viruses are important models for cancer
research.

Chang said doctors have found that it may

be possible to kill cancerous tumors by target- ’

ing virus pathways, a signiﬁcant discovery
because 20 percent of all cancers are related
to infectious diseases. I

Spring break a time to igiveback, gain experiences

Taira Alabi
For The Pitt News

For many Pitt students, spring break is
spent relaxing at home after a hard half-
a-semester’s work at Pitt. '

, But after spending a week lounging on
his couch during spring break his fresh-
man year, Ryan Sosh decided to put him-

  
   

 

self to a better use.

“At first it’s like ‘Oh Ryan, it’s so great
to see you,’ and then two hours later my
parents are like ‘Well, you are still our
son, go and do something,”’ he said.

Sosh, a senior nursing student, want-
ed to get more out of his future spring
breaksand searched for something else
to occupy the week each March. Now,
Sosh is in his third year of participating
in volunteer projects through Pitt.

SPRING BREAK

mersing themselves in American culture.

Pitt’s Alternative Spring Break trips
are coordinated by Pittserves, which,
according to its website, ‘is a University-
wide initiative that connects indiyidual
students and student organizations seek-
ing service opportunities with local and
regional organizations that need volun-
teers for projects.

Pittserves offers‘ students who want
to get more out of spring break the op-

portunity to travel to other regions of C

the country to volunteer. I

Since his sophomore year, Sosh has
been traveling to the Cumberland Trail
in Crossville, Tenn., over break.

In Crossville, Sosh and other Pitt stu-
dents took part in building a part of the
Great Eastern Trail. '

Sosh was drawn to Alternative ‘Spring
Break because he could help people and
also see the results of his work.

“I think the thought of building some-

thing and actually seeing what your work

March 7, 20i 4 I The Pitt News | vvvvw.pittnevvs.com

has done is really appealing,” Sosh said.
According to Sosh, when ﬁnished,
the trail will stretch from Alabama to
the Finger Lakes in New York and act as
an alternative to the heavily—used -Ap-
palachian Trail. ‘ . A _
. Constructing the trail required physi-
cal dexterity.

“There were no cranes. You get down

with your hands and knees and with’ help

from a few other people, you push boul— .

ders to use as stepping stones,” Sosh said.
Sosh’s main worry the first year he
participated in the program was not

, knowing any of the other volunteers.

V “I had no friends going in,” he said.
“Itturns out that a lot of people that go
on these trips are nice people.” ‘

In addition to making new friends,
the trip also serves to promote environ—

.-mental sustainability.

“It’s a way of preserving the area
around [the trail],” Sosh said.

While Sosh’s trip dealt with nature
trails in Tennessee, there are also trips
that go to North Carolina and Washing-
ton, D.C., through PittServes. ‘

One of Kry'styniak’s favorite parts of

. the week is hosting a" dinner for home-

The students cook the meal from start i

“Last year, there was a man who we

iak said.

V-V aAccor_ding to Krystyniak, the trip
helps break down a lot of stereotypes
about homeless people. ‘

“Last year, I was kind of ‘afraid to in-
teract with homeless people, because you
arealways taught to be careful,‘ but they
are really not bad people,” Krystyniak
said.

Aside from alternative spring breaks,
international students from Pitt embark
on cultural trips hosted by Pitt’s Office
of Cross Cultural Leadership and De-
velopment.

According to ShawntiaKey, Pitt’s in-

ternational programming coordinator,
the overarching goal of these trips is_to'

ensure that students have broad new

experiences in the United States.
Students on CCLD’s annual culture
trips travel to some of the United States’

culture hubs, including Atlanta, Chicago - -

and Washington. A .

“One of the reasons why we decided
to start these programs was to teach
students that they can have a cultural

experience in the U.S.,” Key said. “A lot of- .

people feel that to gain a cdltural experi-

' ence you have to go outside [the U.S.], but .
. in a big city you have so many different

cultural groups.” - _

Key has gone on trips to D.C. and Chi-
cago over the past two years. The trips
target international students and aim to

show them U.S. culture and civil rights V

history. _ - .
“Chicago has very diverse ethnic
neighborhoods and Atlanta has a very

strong civil rights history, which is very .
powerful,” Key said. '

 in iMormonl church

  does not reﬂect gender equality

Natalie Russell
Colummst

Equal access to oppression does
not reﬂect an increase in gender
equality, and'perhaps someone
should tell that to the.people cel-
ebrating the fact that Mormon
women are now able to go on mis-
sions at 19 instead of 21 years old.

Iwasn’t sure if I was just hearing
a lot about it because, as awoman
who was raised Mormon, I’m more
exposed to issues and current
events surrounding the Mormon
church, or because it was actually
a big deal to people outside of my
Mormon Facebook friends. But
after an extensive pie'ce“.was pub-

‘ lished in The New York Times on.

Saturday titled “Missions signal a
. growing role for Mormon women,”
I realized that this message is being
spread to a much larger audience.
More importantly, it’s being
spread to an audience that likely

isn’t as familiar with the:‘church’s>

more surreptitious teachings and

policies regarding female mem-
bers. So to those celebrating an
advertised. step toward equality, I
say: not so fast.

A Mormon mission is a rite of
passage in the Mormon church, in
which young people -——- and some
older adults .— are sent to pros-
elytize (preach door to door) in
whatever part of the world God
sees most ﬁt, according to the
mission coordinator’s alleged di-

vine revelation. Traditionally and -

doctrinally, male members are
permitted and socially obligated
to go on missions at 19 years old,
while female members can go at
21. As of October 2012, the Church
ofjesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
announced that women ..could
serve as-youiilg ias]1‘9 — quickly
and spitefullyiadding that men are
now allowed to serve at,18, just in
case‘ anyone was uncomfortable
by the idea of real gender equal-
ity. The rule that women serve for
18 months and men for two years
still stands.

Putting the charade of this
announcement aside, is this re-
ally something, that we should be
celebrating? After all, serving a
mission isn’t exactly a means of
gaining any kind of power and au-
thority within the church. In fact,
the experience is nothing more
than a form of militant servitude.
My sister and I have always joked
about our sneaking suspicion that
missionary training involves get-
ting a lobotomy, but I digress.

Let’s review the rules according
to the Missionary Handbook: All
missionaries are assigned com-
panions of the same gender that
they must never be further than
shouting distance from, except
during certain hygiene-related
activities. Missionaries can only
write- — or email, now,— their
parents once amyveek and can call
onlytwice a year: Christmas and
Mother’s Day. Missionaries are

discouraged from maintaining

wake up at 6:30 a.m., eat breakfast,sexercise
for 30 minutes, spend two hours studying

Prayer and bed time is at 10:30 p.m. sharp.
Missionaries are not allowed to watch televi-

Panthers end regular season with keybout at Clemson

Ryan Bertonaschi
Stqff Wrz'ter

Jamie Dixon is in an unfamiliar position.
In Dixon’s tenure as Pitt’s head coach,

seldom have ﬁnal games of the regular sea-

son mattered, and they even more rarely

' meant_“win and you’re in” or “lose and

you go home.”

But Pitt has dropped four of its past six
games, and the Panthers (22-8, 10-7 ACC)
are on bubble alert heading into Saturday’s
4 p.m. showdown against‘Clemson (19 -10,
10-7 ACC) at Littlejohn Coliseum. V

Guard Cameron Wright said the team is
well aware of the situation in front of them‘.
“We’re in a must-win situation,” Wright
said. -

With the ACC Tournament next week,
the Panthers’ seed will not only be af-
fected by the outcome of 'Saturday’s Pitt-
Clemson game, but the Panthers could
use some help. from a Syracuse team that
has dropped four of the past ﬁve deci-
sions when the Orange takes on Florida
State at 2 p.m. 5

The winner of the Pitt-Clemson game
will take the No. 5 seed in the tournament,
but if Clemson beats Pitt and Syracuse
beats Florida State, Pitt is the No. 6 seed. If

. Clemson beats Pitt and Florida State beats

Syracuse, Pitt is the No. 7 seed.
“We’re well aware of the predicament

we put ourselves in,” Wright said. “It’s '

March Madness for a reason.” .

Onjan. 14 at the Petersen Events Cen-

ter, Dixon’s squad, then with a 16-2 record,
crushed Clemson 76-43, marking Pitt’s
fourth-highest margin of victory in confer-

enceplay in school history. Dixon brushed 1

off the win, saying what’s passed is passed.
“That has a very little impact on the
game on Saturday,” Dixon said.
_ Clemson’s leading scorer. and All—ACC
hopeful K.]. McDaniels sat in foul trouble

‘for most of the game and was held to 11

points. McDaniels is scoring 16.9 points
per contest and leads the conference in
blocks per game (2.8). .

“We got out to a good start and things
just fell our way,” Dixon added. “I saw a

couple of loose balls that ended up 3-point-

ers for us. That’s how sometimes those .
-things occur. That’s a long time ago and

was two months ‘ago, so that’s clear to our

9!

guys.
The Tigers own the second—best scor-

ing defense in the country, allowing 56.7
points per. game, and they average six
blocks per game. '

Talib Zanna led all scorers with 22
points in the ﬁrst matchup, comprised
of mostly two—handed dunks and layups.

Freshman point guard Josh Newkirk scored a career-high 20 points in a loss »Monday..SheIdon Satenstein |AssistantVisual Editor

But with McDaniels back, the Panthers
could have trouble getting easy looks in
the paint, and they may have to rely on
another spark plug for offense.

Josh Newkirk has been that safety valve

in Pitt’s last two games, scoring 28 com-

bined points. .
Against North Carolina State, Newkirk
made ﬁve of ﬁve shots from beyond the
arc. He has now made his last seven, a feat
that hasn’t been accomplished since Sean
Miller did it in 1991. . T

 

 

“I’m just going to do whatever it takes
to stay on the ﬂoor,” Newkirk said.

Through Pitt’s_ recent stretch of tough
losses, injury has been a factor, but many
players seem to be past the recovery stage
of their respective afflictions.
