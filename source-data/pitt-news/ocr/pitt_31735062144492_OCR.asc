Debaters Meet
Here, Headed

By Rosencrans

Approximately 500 high school
stu-dents representing 40 high
schools in the Pittsburgh district
will attend, this Saturday, the
ninth High School Debaters’ con-
ference, conducted annually by
Men’s Debating association.

The high school debaters and
debate coaches will meet in the
auditorium of Stephen Foster me-
morial at 9:45 o’clock in the m-orn-
ing to hear a discussion, Town
Hall style, of the 1944-45 nation-

al high school debate question:
Resolved: That the legal voting
age be lowered to eighteen years.

Chairman of the conference is
Frederic Rosencrans, C, high
school director of men’s debating.
The discussion of the high. school
debate question will be given by
members of the debating associa-
tion, and representatives of men’s
debating at Pennsylvania State
college. Pitt speakers are John
McKinley, E, first affirmative;
Herman iFeldman, C, second af-
firmative; and Victor Stein, C, af-
interrogator. Speakers
from «Penn State are Alex Reis-
dorf, first negative; Ottis Castle-
berry, negative interrogator, and
a third person as yet unannounc-
ed. The address of welcome will
be delivered by Dr. Stanton C.
Crawford, dean of the College.

High school director Rosen-
crans is laying plans for conduct-
ing the December tournament in
the patterns of previous sessions.
The tournament, which is an all-
day affair, consists of a series of
non-decision debate contests, and
a decision discussion contest in
which a group of finalists is se-
lected. From these finalists, who
participate in an extemporaneous
speaking match which closes the
tournament, is chosen. the ﬁnal
winner of the entire contest.

The tournament has served, in
previous years, to open the active
debating program of high school
teams in the Pittsburgh district,
and has afforded these high school
students perhaps their chief op-
portunity for practice debate
work.

serving V—E (Victory in Eu-
rope) day has been adopted for

the chairman.

WSA Discusses Voting
Question At Meeting

Four members of Women’s
Speech association will lead a dis-
cussion on the voting age question
tomorrow at 3:30 o’clock, in 126
Cathedral. The panel will discuss
the current high school debate
question: Resolved that the vot-
ing age should be lowered to 18.

Members of the panel include:
Helen Hodes, Ed, chairman; Rose-
marie Scavariel, Ed; Penn Burke,
BA; and Charlotte Ginsburg, C.
All students are invited to attend
this meeting and participate in the
discussion, according to Rosemarie

Scavariel, president of WSA.

Red feather will make its oﬂi-
cial appearance on campus today
and tomorrow as United War fund
requests students, too, to “Care
Enough to Give Enough.” A table

ﬂying the UWF banner has al-
ready appeared on the ground

, ﬂoor to receive contributions.

Dick ~Briney, C, and Phyllis

 Krieger, C, co-chairmen of the

student campaign, have set the
goal at Pitt this‘year at 10-0 per-
cent participation. An average con-
tribution of «two dollars per stu-
dent has been decided upon, but
the committee hopes that, since

» more students have had summer

and part time jobs, many students
will be able to contribute more
than the average .pledge. They
would like _contributions to be
personal, and to come from the
student’s own budget.

As a part of the campaign, stu-
dent speakers will give talks dur-
ing a 15-minute period set aside in
all third-hour classes today and
tomorrow. The speakers Will dis-
tribute pledge envelopes and red
feathers to those who wish to
make pledges at the time. The
committee would like students to
pay -pledges during «these periods,
but contributions may be made at
the ground-ﬂoor table until No-
vember 6. After that date, pledges
may redeem their promises at the
treasurer’s office.

Only 25 per cent of every stu-
dent dollar contributed leaves the
campus. After 75 per cent deduc-
tions are ma-de for such student
causes as men’s and women's stu-
dent loan funds, YMCA and
YWCA, and Pitt-in-China, the re-
mainder will be spread over the
needs of USO, destitute peoples in
former occupied countries, prison-
ers of war, war-broken families
at ho-me, and some 80 home-front
relief agencies, which help main-
tain community health, provide
recreation for underprivileged
you-th, and contribute to the care
of the aged and handicapped.

Band ‘Comes Out’
At State Game

Pitt band will make its first
public appearance at the stadium,
November 25, for the Penn State
game.

Preparations have been under-
way for the reorganization of the
band this past week. Men students
and army trainees have made ap-
plication for membership, and it
is now established that there is
sufficient interest and a satisfac-
tory instrumentation for a good
band of approximately seventy-
five men.

Anyone interested who has not
yet registered for membership is
invited to do so at once by calling
at the dean of men’s offi-ce. It is
important that all men who wish
to become afiiliated with the band
make certain to ﬁll out an infor-
mation form at the dean of men’s
office.

The glass-enclosed bulletin in
the lower elevator lobby will be
used for band notices. This bul-
letin should be carefully watch-
ed by all concerned in order to
keep advised regarding meetings,
rehearsals, and drills as they are
scheduled.

Injtdﬂilitarian countries_ the fanatical demands made upon the
youth of the country boil down to: “Give for the homeland; sacriﬁce

functions to provide a future of opportunity and hope for its youth.
Because we feel that it embodies the very spirit of that future, we

The quest for limericks
is always fascinating because one
never knows where they will turn
up. I’ve found them in such un-

novels and the correspondence of
the late Dean Inge of St. Paul’s
Cathedral, London, who turns out
to be, sub rosa, a great limerick
connoisseur and the author of sev-
eral clever examples, including
this message to a friend:

“Your limericks, dear Fred, I sur-
mise, S
Were not meant for clerical eyes
For the Bishop and Dean
Cannot think what they mean,
While the curate turns pink with

surprise.”

The limerick, although its tra-
ditional birthplace is Limerick,
Ireland, seems to have reached its
height in England, where, in ad-
dition to the dozens of clerical
limericks composed by Dean Inge
and his coterie, there is a whole
classiﬁcation based on peculiarities
of British pronunciation. The fol-
lowing masterpiece was composed

The attendance at the chapel
service last Friday was nothing
less than a disgrace. Less than a
hundred students were there,
scattered here and yon, and you
can just bet your boots the Tuck
shops were ﬁlled to capacity at
the very same time.

There’s probably a reason for
the poor showing at the weekly
service, but, try as I did, I couldn’t
think of even a half-way decent
one. This year, the service is held
for 25 minutes, from 1 to 1:25
o’clo-ck. That leaves you 30 min-
utes for lunch, certainly a rea-
sonable amount of time, and 15
minutes to make your sixth-hour
class. So the time element
shouldn't bother anyone.

The other alternative is that
it might possibly be an incon-
venience. Even if -one is through
with his lunch at 1 o’clock, he
still likes to have a few cigar-
ettes and talk with his friends
whom he hasn’t seen sin-ce yes-
terday. It seems rather hopeless
to point out to these people that
the service is weekly, that they
have every other day to loll
around, and that it wouldn’t be a
bad idea to take their friends with
them to chapel. One would no
sooner attempt to urge such leth-
argic beings over to the Heinz

Editor, Pitt News:
Dignity and ‘propriety et cetera,

' are ﬁne but it seems to me that

there is a sufficiency of decorum
in the decor of this University
without carrying that quality into
the Tuck shops, the students’ on-
ly retreats into informality in this
institution. The murals already
on the walls of both the red and
blue rooms are undoubtedly in
perfect color harmony with the
remainder of the decorative
scheme, but somehow they fail to
inspire in me the proper elan,
the carefree spirit that makes for
relaxation between hours of study
and -classes. They are excellent

for a good restaurant or tea room, .

but they do not have the look of
a gathering -place for college stu-
dents.

Pitt has a department of ﬁne
arts. There are students who
have the talent to do wall dec-
orations for school dances and
other social affairs. May we sug-
gest that some of those same tal-
ented student artists be allowed
to design murals for the Tuck
shop walls, murals that will be in
keeping the spirit of students,
perhaps depicting student life?

Perhaps a contest could be held,

with the prize-winning designs,
with the approval of the student
body, actually to -be executed on
the Tuck shop walls.

Sincerely,

Nita Donaldson.

Pitkins Add Social Hour

Pitkin club will add a social hour
following the regular 6 o’clock
Wednesday meeting on November
1, in the Shadyside Presbyterian
church. This activity has been
added to the discussion program
to make it possible for Pitkins and
Tecktons to become better ac-
quainted.

Those students interested are
asked to sign up on the notice
posted on the bulletin board.

Don’t miss the debate on

1944 Presidential Campaign”!!!

vince the waitresses in the red
Tuck shop to give him a glass for
his water. Some things, you know,
are impossible. The press might
have some power, but it doesn’t
provide iron hands with each copy
to heave people from their seats.

The students to whom this ap-
peal must -be made are the fresh”-
men and those who weren’t aware
that the service doesn’t take in
the full hour. The latter, I hope,
now understand the situation; the
former, of course, haven't had
much time to realize the oppor-
tunities available for them at
Pitt. I could ﬁll a lot of space ex-
pounding on the beauty of the
chapel, the excellence of our choir
and speakers, but it would be a
better idea if you went over this
Friday to see f-or yourself. Then,
if you consider it unproductive,
that’s your decision, and no one
will quibble with you. But give
it a chance, won't you?

There are thousands of stu-
dents at Pitt. The chapel should
be crowded, in fact overﬂowing,
even if the services were held
every day in the week. The ex-
isting condition isn’t good; it isn’t
right, and it shouldn’t continue.
Something has been said about it.
Now something should be done.

Pitt Serviceman Snbscrs
To News With F Note

Although it is not ordinarily
this reporter’s practice to read
other’ people’s mail, I can and
must testify that the fan mail of
one John Whiteman is extremely
interesting. I just “happened” to
read .a letter of John’s from a
Lieutenant Don Brown, and I must
admit it was well worth the trou-
ble I had steaming the thing
open.

Lt. Brown attended the Pitt
School of Engineering from ’38 to
’43 and then traded college for
khaki and the engineering corps.
His letter is dated October fourth
and comes from somewhere in
France.

The_ lieutenant had formerly
written the News asking for a
subscription, and John Whiteman
had informed him of the paper’s
policy of charging subscribers a
rate of one dollar for mailing. En-
-closed in Don’s recent letter was
a ﬁfty-franc note which was the

‘closest thing he had to a dollar.

He says that the last time he saw
American money was June 1943.
Imagine being broke that long!

A few weeks ago Lt. Brown
went through Paris and managed
to stay there for a few days. He
was so impressed by the beauty of
the city that he finds it impossible
to describe. He tells John that
crowds followed them everywhere,
the girls were beautiful, and that
he had never been kissed so much
and by so many people in all his
life.

As for the war, it is his opinion
that Germany may crack in a
month or hang on for -a year. She
is ﬁghting for her life and there-
fore, he thinks it will be a long,
hard winter.

If John and Lt. Brown will for-
give me I’d like to quote a part
of the letter:

them and they make you feel ten

Voters Debate
On Election

[Students who have not yet de-
-cided whether it will be Roosevelt
or Dewey on their ballots will
have an opportunity to ‘participate
in a debate on the election issues
tomorrow at 12:30 in room 132.
Four members of Men’s Debating
association are to head the pro-
gram by engaging in a twenty
minute verbal duel over the mer-
its of the two candidates. Follow-
ing the short speeches, members
of the audience will have half an
hour in which to question the
speakers.

Sponsoring this battle of ideas
is the Young Men’s Christian as-
sociation in conjunction with a
group of interested students. Frank
McWade, C, representing the “Y,”
June Thomson, C, and Chris Man-
ion, C, representing independent
student voters, are in charge of
the program.

Herman Feldman, C, and Lee
Hershenson, C, will represent the
interests of the Democratic can-
didacy in opposition to the Dewey
advocates, Richard Davis, C, and
Richard 'Hazley, C. All four have
been recruited from Men’s Debat-
ing association at whose meetings
the question has been argued
heatedly in informal debates. This
preparation would foreshadow a
partisan conflict of high caliber.

Since the «greater ‘part of the
program has been set aside for
audience -participation, it is like-
ly, say the speakers, that funda-
mental issues and facts, rather
than oratory, will dominate the
program. “Students with an open
mind are promised something oth-
er than passion to dig their teeth
into,” is the promise of the speak-
ers.

The big event in fraternity and
independent life this week is the
Soph hop, Off The Record Ball.
According to my own off the rec-
ord poll, all of the fraternities are
supporting the dance, and a big
turnout is expected.

The Deltsl have pledged six more
boys since the rush week results
were revealed. The newest Delt
pledges are Bill Thomson, Bill
Church, Gene Gaugler, Jim Bar-
nick, Ray Boore, and Glenn Stuart.

Last Friday afternoon the Phi
Delts had a tea dance for the
Thetas at the Phi Delt house. And
this Friday evening the boys are
having a hard times dance. The
hard times have nothing to do
with the tea dance.

The Phi Eps also have a few new
pledges who came in since rush
week. They are Charles Fenster-
sheib, Irving Germeise, and Alex
Smith.

The Phi Gams are still talking
about the dance they had at their
house recently, which featured
music by a nine piece band and in
line with the Halloween spirit, the
Phi Gams had another party at
the house last Friday evening.

Another social on the Figi list is
the alumni dinner to be held at
their house on Saturday, Novem-
ber 4.

The PiKAs also had a Halloween
dance last Friday evening, with
‘pumpkins and all the other spook’s

*1. Q. on the faculty.

A May graduate of ,Muskingum
college, Mrs. McDowell majored in
speech and minored in physical
education. She was also active 'i'n

the WAA, YWCA, College Social
committee, and the Muskingum
players, a group whose function
is similar to our Pitt players.

Of her job Mrs. ‘McDowell says,
“It is certainly new and different.
You never know what to expect.”

She says the only experience she
had quite like it was; when she
worked during the summer of 1943
as an informatioznist at Rocker-
feller Center, N. Y. There, it was
her job to help -peoplein ﬁnding
their way through the “city within
a city.” During the course of the
day she met sight-seers, movie

stars, educators, and 1 clergy, a
varied type of people.
When questioned as to her

greatest interest, Mrs. »‘ McDowell
smilingly replied. “My,;.%husband.”
He is Ensign David EQ, McDowell
who is now serving on sea duty
aboard an L.S.T. training ship.
Ensign and Mrs. McDow‘ell are
both Muskingum graduates. They
were married in December, 1943.

This past summer .Mrs. Mc-
Dowell stayed in Norfolk, Va.,

where she led the lifeiof a Navy ‘

wife, “waiting for her ship to
come in.”

Since returning .fromfNorfolk to
take her position in the informa-
tion room, Mrs. McDowell has had
little time for outside activities.
She has, however, begun a gradu-
ate cour.+:e in personnel adminis-
tration and after she"“gets set-
tled” hopes to pursue one of her
favorite sports, swimming.

Wednesday, November 1, 1944

By Ursula Halloran

If someoneapproaches you this
week and tries to sell you the
nearest thing to a miniature bill-
board: that you’ve ever seen—buy
it—it’s a ticket to the Off-the-
Record dance Saturday night. ‘(Il-
legal advertisement).

J. Matthew (or—I can’t give you
anything but love baby, and what
more do you want) Smith drew
quite a crowd at the game on Sat-
urday with his story of how he
kemtoned the family living room.
When asked by a dubious by-
stander why he used a putty knife
to apply the stuff, he retorted in
a glum tone, “How the hell was
I to know you’re supposed to mix
it with water ﬁrst?”

Latest dance craze is the
“Cokey-Cokey” dance introduced
by Jame Du.dley and Jug Crock at
the Phi Delt tea dance last week.

All I can ﬁnd out about it is that

it's something like the Hoochy-
K-oochy —- only more so. Is that
enough?

There’s only one thing wrong
with writing a gossip column—all
the romances that hit the Monday
afternoon deadline are deﬁnitely
dead lines by Wednesday morning
when the News comes out. How-
somever—t‘he latest is the Phyllis
Krieger-Bob Buell combination
which has been very warm ever
since rush week. Somebody cross-
ed them up on the forthcoming
Tri-Delt hay ride, though, and
beat Krieg-er to the draw.

Betty Fink, a very neat fresh-
man, and Larry Hamilton, Phi
Gam operator, are together late-
ly. Speakin’ of Phi Gams—and
who isn’t-—Ray (King Tut) Rep-
pert’s intentions are getting
blonder_ and blonder—oops--I

.-mean bolder and bolder. All Fiji

reports are through: the courtesy
of Ray (Prince Schlemeel) Yourd.

It was good to see Rol Merchant
home over the week-end‘. He made
the Friday and Saturday night
rounds with Jeanne Gousha, which
is no surprise.

Also back in Pittsburgh over
the week-end was Jake Pearsal.
With no time to dash to the Tuck
shop for a quick howdy to all his
old pals, Jake left word with one
of our sources of information to
say hi to them. This same source
—-which is, by the way, the moth
who’s spending this winter gourg-
ing himself in Omar’s wool tent-
says that Jake will be back in
school comes the spring semester
in February.

’nother visitor was Bob Hagel
home from the army, who bee-
lined for the ZTA booth on his
arrival at the Forbes street en-
trance in Japanese submarine No.
786. (‘Sounds exciting, don’t it?
But it's a line; ﬁlthy gossip.)
Guess why that particular booth,
though.

and Dick Barnhart

Bun Crawford’s hard work at
the canteen is starting to pay off,
judging by the gob that escorted
her to the game Saturday. He's a
Phi Delt from Case and stationed
here in town.

Happy Kappas (Is this that
thing called alliteration?) are
Judy Richmond and Ginnie Vol-
kay whose men buzzed home this
week.

Blind date department: Who
says they’re sad? Eleanor Lynch
and Jane Forsythe are all for ’em.
They combinated with Chuck
Tremont and Chuck Berg (in or-
der of succession) this ‘week-end.
Angelo Salvadore also had a blind
date—with Charlotte Bittner and
before meeting her, he swore if
she was sad, he’d run around the
Cathedral in a bathing suit on the
coldest day in January. Doesn’t
have to -— good date —- everybody
happy.

WE'RE WATCHIN: Gloria Rest-
ler and Larry Hazeltine; Donna
Moore and John Gallagher; the
Phi Kappa-TPA Alliance; George
Valentine (.he’s real cute).

See you’ns at the Soph hop
-—alias Off—the-Record Ball. “Till
Then”—Hub-a-hub-a—hub.

Sigma Chi Leads
Chapel Service

Jackson Ice, C, will represent
Sigma Chi when he leads prayer
at this week’s Friday chapel serv-
ice. Dr. Farmer will continue
speaking on the beauty and sym-
bolism of the Windows of Heinz
chapel and give the history of the
living examples pictured. The
Heinz Chapel choir will give their
rendition of “Beautiful Savior” by
E. Melius Christiansen, accom-
panied by Mr. Lotz, who will play
for ﬁfteen minutes before the pro-
gram.

The plan for fraternity sponsor-
ship of the weekly services has re-
cently been adopted for more stu-
dent cooperation. Next semester
all campus activities and organi-
zations and interested individuals
will be invited to volunteer for
leadership.

Rodin’s Worlis .'
On Exhibit
In Gallery

Currently on display at the sev-
enth ﬁoor art gallery is Dr. Julius
Spitzer’s collection of Rodin water
colors and movement studies. A
private New York collector, Dr.
Spitzer has loaned his group to
our library where they are now
on exhibition with some original
jottings of Rodin and aquarelle
facsimiles of his more famous
sketches. The latter are the gift
of Edward Duff Balkan to the
University art collection.

Among the sketches are several
from the noted Gates of Hell
which Rodin was commissioned to
create for the Museum of Dec-
orative Arts. Though never com-
pleted, this piece has always been
considered his greatest work. In-
spired by Dante’s Inferno and
further incouraged by the writ-
ings of Baudelaire, Rodin con‘-
ceived the idea of depicting what
Anatole France called, “this hell
on earth” by means of a colossal
bronze door.

Surmounting the door is the
Thinker or Poet -as Rodin called
him, perhaps the most popular
piece the sculptor ever made. Be-
low this solitary and commanding
ﬁgure swarm one hundred eighty-
six assorted -demons, devils, and
tortured souls, each a master-
piece in itself. Combined as a
whole, the door would have been
but, unfortunately,
Rodin’s interest in the work wan-
ed. And, although for over twen-
ty years the artist added to and
subtracted from the Gates, they
are still small-scale models, quite
incomplete.

Also included in the collection
are a great many examples of
Rodin’s “instantaneous movement”
sketches. These wash-treated pen
and ink sketches are quite char-
acteristic of the peculiar Rodin

technique.

At Conference

The ﬁrst of a series of-annual
research conferences on x-ray and
electron diffraction will be spon-
sored by the University of Pitts-
burgh on November 3' and 4 in
open meetings at Mellon institute.

Wheeler P. Davey, research pro-
fessor of “physics and chemistry at
Pennsylvania State college, will
speak on x-ray diffraction studies
on materials of physical and metal-
lurgical interest. Professor Davey
has been chairman of the joint
subcommittee on chemical analysis
by x-ray diffraction methods since
1940.

Professor I. Fankuchen of Poly-
technic Institute of Brooklyn will
cover x-ray diffraction studies on
materials of biological interest.
Other speakers will be men from
the University, Carnegie Institute
of Technology, and from the x-ray
and electron diffraction labora-
tories of industries in the Pitts-
burgh area.

Representing the University will
be Dr. H. E. Longenecker, dean of
research in the natural sciences,
and Dr. S. S. Sidhu, assistant pro-
fessor of physics. Dr. Sidhu who
is physicist in charge of the Uni-
versity’s co-operative x-ray labor-
atory, said, “The cooperation on
the part of all participants in the
conference has been wonderful.”

Pitt Men Attend Meeting

Dr. B. F. Daubert, assistant re-
search professor and senior re-
search fellow in chemistry, and
Dr. L. J. 1'Filer, Jr., senior research
fellow in chemistry, attended a
meeting of the »American Oil
Chemists society in Chicago Oc-
tober 25-27. Dr. Daubert present-
ed a paper on “Polymorphism of
Synthetic Glycerides.”

This is a woman’s world. When
a man is‘ born people say, “How
is the mother?” when he marries,
they say, “What a lovely bride!”
And when he dies they say, “How
much did he leave her?”

More Students

Want To Live
On Campus

No room! No room! Student
houses for women are ﬁlled to ca-
pacity this semester. The deﬁnite
trend of commuters’ wanting to
move onto the campus is shown
by the increase from 54 girls liv-
ing in student houses three years
ago to 130_ and a waiting list of
more than 25 this year.

Additional girls have b e en
placed by the dean of Women’s" of-
ﬁce in the Stephen's house and in
each of the fraternity houses. This
year the new Delta Zeta house has
helped also in relieving the room
shortage.

Contrary to general practice,
these fraternity houses are not
restricted to fraternity members
only. There are not enough mem-
bers of any fraternity at Pitt to
ﬁll a house or to support one.

Upperclassmen Have Choice

Upperclass students have ﬁrst
choice of the rooms in the spring.
Miss Hill, assistant to the dean of
women, then places the freshmen
and other University women in
order of application. She tries to
arrange that girls with similar in-
terests room together. For in-
stance, a senior does not room with
a freshman, but rather with an-
other upperclassman.

to the dean of women, is the grad-
uate counselor for students in the

Capture Double IF Triumphs

Strong Teams

6 Predominate

By Lowell Lubic

PiKAs Trounce Pi Lambs

The PiKA’s Wallopéd the Pi
Lambs, 42-0, to start the season.
Early in the ﬁrst quarter a long
pass fro-m Gallagher to Wood net-
ted a score. From then -on, only
consistent penalties kept the
PiKAs from scoring at will. The
game was hampered by muddy
grounds which slowed -down both
teams.

SAEs Overcome Stubborn

Sigma Chis

The SAEs beat a stubborn Sig-
ma Chi team, 6-0, by a long pass
that was completed to Sciullo in
the end zone. Before this neither

team was able to penetrate its
opponent’s territory. The game was
featured by the great defensive
play of both teams.
Phi Eps Win Two
The Phi Eps, exhibiting a pow-

' erful running and passing attack,

overcame :the Phi Delts, 18-6.
Trailing, the Phi Eps by virtue of
two touchdown passes thrown by
Blumenﬁeld to Lampl and See-
wald, the Phi Delts struck back
with a long pass that bounced
off Seewald’s ﬁngertips only to
be caught by a Phi Delt for the
score. Late in the fourth quarter
the Phi Eps sewed up the game
with a sh-ort pass completed to

Goldfarb in‘ the end zone. In their

second game of the week the Phi
Eps defeated the Phi Gams, 12-0.
The highlight of the -game came
when .Weissman intercepted a Phi
Gam pass and dodged his way
through the entire team for a

_ sc-ore. Before this the Phi Eps had

scored on a pass, Blumenﬁeld to
Lampl. The Phi Gams with the
passing of Ira Marshall threaten-
ed consistently but could n-ot push
the ball over into pay dirt.

Delta became the favorite team

Led by the passing combination
of Biehl to Thomson, the Delts
overpowered their opponents with
unbelievable ease. So well were
their passing and running plays
mixed up that neither the Phi
Gams nor the Phi Delts could set

up a proper defense. Even in vic-
tory, the Delts showed good.
sportsmanship by using substitu-
tions freely.

With the Panthers back in the
winning stride, ‘things began to
brighten for a little while on the
campus. Yes indeed, West Virginia

sure gave the Panthers a shot in
the arm by upsetting the Lions
from Penn State. After all, Pitt
had bounced one on Wes-t Virginia,
so, why couldn’t Pitt also "bounce

one on . . .?

This bright spot, however, is
away in the distant future. Nearer
at hand is the game two weeks
hence with the Ohio State Buck-
eyes. The Buckeyes are an all-
civilian team. :So is Pitt. So what»
If you recall last season, Pitt was,
supposed to be in its -own class in
the Ohio State game. The Pan-
thers of last year had played
service-loaded elevens, and the
boyish Buckeye squad was sup-
posed to be right up Pitt’s alley.
Many fans expected a surprise and
they certainly got one when the
Jungle Ca-ts got snowed under.
No one, this year, is saying that
Pitt is going to play a team in its
own class. Oh no. The big wonder
this campaign is how does Ohio
State do it? What makes this
civilian eleven tick, while Pitt,
with one of the best coaches in
the country, i.s being pushed all
over the lot? Maybe you know
the answer?

is the best team, the squad ahead
at the ﬁnish of the contest is the
better eleven on the ﬁeld. But,
this writer ﬁgures that Notre

expert passing, although.it was

Wolfess Wolfe Gets Wolf
To Give Her The Air

By BettY Wolfe

“Good afternoon, everyone. lt’s
ideal football weather here at the
Pitt stadium today and just in a
moment, I’ll have the line-ups for
you . there’s the toss
Pitt will kick off . . the game
is on. ” A

And “Woody” Wolf is on . .
This voluble gentleman
is the sports announcer for the
Pitt football games and brings an
exciting play-by-play description
of the gridiron contests to those
less fortunate Pitt fans who must
sit at home and listen by the side
of their radios. ‘

Although by birth a member
of the Boer colony in South Afri-
ca, Mr. Wolf took out his U. S.
citizenship papers after seeing ac-
tion in France during World War
I.“Woody” attended the Univer-
sity of Michigan where he par-
ticipated in football and track.
Further training in physical edu-
cation courses at Chicago enabled
him to begin his career ﬁrst as a
high school football coach and
then as a mentor of small college
teams. “Once when I was coach-
ing at Lock Haven State Teach-
ers college, Jimmy Hagan, now
your director of athletics at Pitt,
played on one of the opposing
teams,” said the sports broadcas-
ter. '

“Woody's” home is in Williams-
port, Pa., where he runs an in-
surance business along with the
weekly sports program he_gives
over the local radio station. He
said that one of the funniest ex-
periences he has had in his career
happened at last year’s game with
Illinois. “Bill Sutherland, the At-
lantic commercial announcer, and
I got our mikes switched some
way. While he would be giving

ithe commercial, you could hear
me too, talking on the other mike.”
When pressed for a statement
concerning Pitt, Mr. Wolfe an-
swered that he has always liked
the Panthers’ spirit, and gave
further praise to former Pitt stu-
dents, Andy Ferguson, now a 1st
Lt. in the U. S. Marine Corps, and
Clair (Tay) Malarkey, Pitt bas-
ketball star, who have served as
spotters for him -during games.

Never entrust a thinking job to
two or three persons. One will do
all the thinking; the others will
only talk and distract the thinker.

A famous ballplayerfs advice
contains a gem of wisdom for all
of us: “Know ahead of time what
you are going to do with the ball
when you get it.”

Panther Gridders Get Chance

To Recover From Injuries

A bruised and battered Panther

football squad gets a well-earned’

rest this weekend, a vacation that
is the gift of some far-sighted
schedule maker. The Pitt gridsters
triumphed over C.hatham ﬁe1d’s

Blockbusters last Saturday with-
out adding anymore players to the
injured list. Contrast this to the
Illinois game the week before
when four locals were helped
from the gridiron. Of this quar-
tet, only Gene Gaugler was able
to get ba-ck into action against
the soldier team. Center Loren
Braner, halfback Buddy Freese
and Lou Yakopec, a fullback,
were still nursing injuries and sat
the game out.

The rest this coming Saturday
will give the team a chance to
gain its full strength for the com-
ing struggles against the unde-
feated Ohio State Buckeyes, the

high—ﬂying Indiana H0-osiers and
the ever-tough Penn State Lions.
Coach Shaughnessy, however, has
workouts lined up for the team in
an effort to iron out the many
rough sp-ots that appear in each
game. ‘The main difficulty in the
Chatham contest was the inability
of the pass receivers to hold onto
the heaves of Paul Rickards. The
Panther quarterback completed
nine of 22 passes and would have
had a better average with some
glue-ﬁngered r e c e i v e r s. . By
smoothing out these errors, the
Panthers, with a record of three
wins out ofsix, hope to end the
season with at least two triumphs
out of the three remaining con-
tests. And with the Chatham game
showing a stubborn Panther de-
fense, the expected improvement
in offensive power may cause sur-
prises before the season is over.

I[e’s Back - -

I took a vacation, my dear frens,
I really needed the rest.
But all the top guys do it, and
am I not among the best?

I have a darn good average; why,
it’s way up there on top.

I think I’m just the best there is—-

(Oh pleez Yogi, stop).

I’ll just quit raving, but I was

quite mad,

the Panthers not winning

which made me so sad.

But the Cats stop this week and
take a little snooze,

So let’s get on with the business,
(hey! give me back by
booze).

Congratulations, compliments, and
threats keep pouring in,

But best of all I like the stuﬁ
that’s not from next-of-kin.

Carlson Works Out Method
To Measure Physical Fitness

By Rusty Clarke
According to Dr. H. C. Carlson, Pitt’s health director for men, it
is a simple task to determine if your body is conditioned to physical
activity. Dr. Carlson, who has been working on this theory for almost
12 years, says a doctor can examine your physical structure, but only

,you can discover if you are getting the most you can at least cost.

Two factors are involved, pulse rates and measured efforts.
You must ﬁrst know how to take a pulse by placing the middle

three ﬁngers of the right hand on¢

the left arm a half inch from the
wrist joint along the thumb line.
Count the number of pulsations
for ten seconds and multiply by
six. For the testing of your con-
dition, count your pulse before the
measured effort, immediately aft-
erward, and after two, four, and

six minutes of rest. Add the ﬁve '

readings for your total score.

The measured effort is spot run-
ning--running in place, raising
and lowering the feet as fast as
possible. Do this for ten seconds,
counting the number of times the
right foot hits the ground. Rest
for ten seconds and record the
number of right foot contacts. Do
this ten times, alternately running
in place and resting. The sum of
right foot contacts is your produc-
tion.

From the ﬁrst table below ﬁnd
the evaluation number for your
production. Add them together
and from the second table you can
ﬁnd the evaluation sum of your
condition.

Record Releases . . .

Have any of you disc jockeys
noticed the number of catchy tunes
being released lately? The latest
is one from the picture “Meet Me
in St.‘Louis” called the “Trolley
Song.” It’s been put on wax by
the Four King sisters. On the flip-
over is “My Heart Sings.” An-
other novelty number that rates
high is “Twilight Time” as done
by the Three Sons. It really is a
unique arrangement of the neat
tune. While you’re at it, listen
to Ethel Smith’s rendition of
“Tico Tico.” Man, how those
hands do ﬂy! 1

On a reissue from the Victor
ﬁles we ﬁnd Tommy Dorsey otter-
ing “Two in Love,” and “Whisper-
ing.” On the former, Frank
Sinatra solos the vocal and on
“Whispering” the Pied Pipers
harmonize with the Voice.

Hal McIntyre’s latest is “It

Might Have Been,” a new Cole
Porter ballad, and on the reverse,
an instrumental “Daisy May.”
