Stemming from dissatisfaction
with wages. medical and health
coverage and alleged discrimina-
tion procedures at the University.
a group of technical and clerical
employees are attempting to un-
ionize University employees and
staff members under the arm of

Union No. 1199. They will hold a
meeting Thursday at University
and City Ministries at 5:15 p.m. to

Financial Crisis

by ELEANOR ADAMENTS
Staff Writer

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
dismissed the possibility of solv-
ing the University's financial cris-
is through a gigantic tuition in-
crease at a special press confer-
ence Monday. Though a slight tui-
tion increase may be necessary
next fall, the Chancellor stressed
the need for a full appropriation
from the State Legislature if the
:University is to continue opera-
tions after the limit of its/borrow-
ing capacity is reached in.May or
June.

“The gravity of the financial
.situation is such that it cannot be

’ solved by a tuition increase or eco-

nomies this year,“ Dr. Posvar
said. “Any financial benefits from
a drastic tuition increase would
be offset by the loss of a substan-
tial number of students who sim-
ply could not afford to pay the in-
creased rate."

The futility of a tuition increase
this year is based on the fact that
the University has already began
billing, and registration proce-

bution individuals may make ac-
cording to age classification.
Another area of controversy in-
volves alleged faculty staff dis-
crimination practices. With infor-
mation provided by The Handbook
for Faculty, 1970. the dissatisfied

dures and that all funds for this
year have already been commit-
ed. To further compound the prob-
lem, the anticipated loss of a large
percentage of students would ne-
gate the value of a large tuition in-
crease. ‘ - "‘

Chancellor Posvar informed
members of the local press that
he and the heads of Pennsylvania's
two other state-related universi-
ties agreed last week in Harris-
burg that full appropriations are
necessaryif theirschools are to

appropriations. the group felt that
the situation serves to underline
their problems: "we won't be able
to collect unemployment if the op-
erations of the University come
to a halt." stated a discussion pa-
per on the topic. A union contract

classifications and in most cases
are ‘doing work on a level beyond
that required by their classifica-
tion and are not getting any addi-
tional pay."

—that the University pay all the
health and medical costs for
employees and their families
under the 1199 benefit plan. This
includes medical, disability and
life insurance costs, along with
eye examination and optometry
fees. '

The workers are additionally
suggesting that the University set
up an employees‘ Health Service.
a convenience already established
at one of the organized universi-
ties. -

Under the present system here.
employees must pay for Blue
Shield and Blue Cross insurance
plans: the TIAA pension: plan

   

  

staffers requested that they -,»be
given the same privileges as fac-
ulty members including: scholar-
ships to othefuniversities and col—.
leges for their children: participa-
tion in the TIAA pension plan upon
hiring rather than the alloted

three years’ wait before eligibil-
ity: scholarship grants to spouses
that have been accepted as de-
gree candidates.

‘A further area of faculty staff
contention lies in the promise of
the University. to finance a yearly
medical examination for faculty
members up to the amount of $40.

The paper concludes that. staff

members should also be eligible.
An additional. clause of their
request encourages the Universi-
ty to look into discrimination
_ against Afro-American employees
here.

The cadre has taken as its mot-
to. "To make less than $100 a week
is starvation; to pay less than
$100 a week is criminal."

Chancellor Wesley.Posvar in a
statement issued Jan. 8_ declared
that “Hospital workers should

tively if they wish to do so. to have
satisfactory working conditions.

The Chancellor reported that"
many of the legislators he talked ‘ '_
with last week in Harrisburg said-"~ ..
they wanted and needed the guid- '1 
ance of their constituents and are ’
beginning to receive a larger per:
centage of letters from concerned 
taxpayers and students. _ -

tors as to the kind of tax legisla-‘
tion they prefer. I believe that our ‘H .
State Legislators will honestly try I’
to fulfill the will of the people” the
Chancellor said. ‘

Dr. Posvar estimated that
“scores of billions of dollars’_’-6'
may be lost if higher education in,
Pennsylvania is financially crip-
pled for the next five or ten years. I
Loss of faculty and school depart-;

to close down even for a short per

V schools foras long as a decade. ~

“It is unthinkable to allow Penn-‘ 3
sylvania’s system of higher edu-
cation to go down the drain. But;
all of us are now being forced to‘
think about. the unthinkable,”g"‘.
Chancellor Posvar stated} ’ L 

When asked by reporters if the
large “For Sale Sign’? strungj"
across the front of the Cat_hedral;~
of Learning‘mea_nt that the Uni‘
versity was contemplating sell.
ing its buildings, the Chancelloiji}
denied that such a possibility was_.;

tration. - A ‘_

"The sign was put up by some
students,” Dr. -Posvar explained
“But if it helps draw. public attén
tion to our plight, I’m.a1l for it.’
The Chancellor also denied "re3‘fff
ports‘ that the University willclose '
down for a period as a method‘of'f,
demonstrating its dissatisfaction'»
with the State Legislature. He fel
such action would merely deprive"
students of their education and
serve no effective purpose insofar
as influencing the State Legisla
ture into taking constructive ac
tion. ’

Student Affairs Administrator

Kobosky finds Pitt Tremendous Challenge

by JIM J EHOVICS
Contributing Writer

The position of Assistant Chan-
cellor of Student Affairs requires
a man of extraordinary energy,
dedication and versatility. Bern-
ard Kobosky. who has held this
position since September, meets
all these requirements. He has
distinguished himself as an ad-
ministrator in a very short time.

Before coming to Pitt, Mr. Ko-
bosky was the director of admis-
sions at Duquesne. He came to
Pitt in 1965 as the director of ad-
missions. Says Mr. Kobosky, “If
you want to prove something, you
have got to get away: you have got
to show what you can do and ac-
cept the challenge. Pitt was a tre-
mendous challenge. We were go-
ing into our state-relatedness. The
opportunity was there for pro-
gress and for real challenge, so I
became director of admissions un-
til last September."

As Assistant Chancellor of Stu-
dent Affairs, Mr. Kobosky is in
charge of the Dean of Students Of-

fice. the Student Union. Student
Housing. Student Publications.
Admissions. the University Coun-
seling Center and the University
Placement Service. Jokingl'y. he
noted. "The Assistant Chancellor
of Student Affairs is in charge of
every darn problem you can think
of." .

Concerning the new Student Un-
ion, Mr. Kobosky stated, “We
have a proposal in front of the
State Authority in Harrisburg and
in a short period of time the preli-
minary plans have been discussed.
We are really moving on this
thing.” What about student hous-
ing? Mr. Kobosky explains, “The
new Hillside dormitories will be
constructed and we shall house
another 1,500 students on campus.
It will be a living-learning com-
plex with apartment-type living.
We are greatly looking forward to
University housing.”

When asked about possible im-
provements for commuter park-
ing, Mr. Kobosky stated, "The
parking situation will be allevi-

ated when the Pirates move out of
Forbes Field. and the Forbes
space complex goes in.“ He went
on to say that commuters are an
integral part of the University.
Mr. Kobosky emphasized that the
students at the University are
broken into thirds——on'e third liv-
ing in the dormitories, one third
living in apartments away from
the University and the last third
living with their parents. Concern-
ing the Commuter Association Mr.
Kobosky said, “The commuters
are getting the short end of the
stick. They are a very strong back-
bone of the school and I will do all
I can to assist the Commuter As-
sociation and its problems."

Commenting on the contact he
has had with students in his short
tenure of office, Kobosky stated,
“The student body, across the
board, has been extremely helpful
to me. The relationship I have had
has been very warm and cordial,
and I am very pleased with the
way we have worked with the stu-

dent body. It has been a strong re-
lationship.” He added, “I have
great faith in the present genera-

tion. They are dedicated and com-. .

mited. They are an outstanding
group.“

In the sports field, Mr. Kobosky

asserted that Pitt’s state relation- ’

ship has helped. For the future, he
predicts that Pitt will be making
great strides in athletic areas.

Mr. Kobosky mentioned two re-
cently recruited high school sen-

iors who will be coming here next —»

year. They are Clair Wilson, a

halfback from the Kiski Area, and

Bob Medvid from Sto-Rox.

Along with his hobbies of sports
and music, Mr. Kobosky has a
very unusual" one. He collects
wines. “It goes without saying,”
he admitted, “that we sample
some of them now and then.”

Mr. Kobosky has within him the
determination, the desire and the
energy that impels him not to be
just merely good at a particular
job, but to be the best.

How they
married-
Without a
minister

He stood with her in an ex-
pecting silence. His hand
then reached .for hers, and
they said in turn, “. . . I take
thee . . .” No organ pealed
forth, no minister spoke. But,
in the regathered quiet, one
who had come to witness
rose, and spoke of ﬁdelity
and responsibility and the
love that gives life. And
though a traditional cere-
mony seemed to be missing,
the two became one in God’s

any marriage sacred.

The bride was lovely. . .

even in a simple gown. The
wedding required no cere-
monials, no formal blessing.
For to Quakers a ritual or
person who intercedes be-
tween man and his God is
unnecessary. No one day of
the week is holier than any
other. And all acts are equally
sacred because’ we live always
in the presence of God.

Do you ﬁnd that the essen-
tials of your religious life seem
to be obscured? Could an ap-
proach without dogma or for-
mula be a sensible one for you?
If so, we have some free and
quite readable leaﬂets which
we’ll gladly send. ‘

..."°and we headed to mardi gras”

'INTRODUCTION

by Dave Tiernan
. Bill and J. T. were in Wohl-
farth’s (where else??) Friday af-
iternoon. I saw Bill and told him I
was looking for someone driving

__to Mardi Gras. He called J .T. over.

‘J. T. liked the idea, but his VW
. tired from its summer drive to
California. Three hours later we
were eating pizza in W. Va. Satur-
—day evening we were on the
I streets of New Orleans, drinking
-wine, singing and doing a little
Zdope with the two friends we had
-made on the way down.

-A - We met a lot of good folks in
that week. A lot of freaks; a lot

of young kids trying like hell to be

‘:1 freaks‘. We saw the New Orleans

' pigs bust heads, but surprisingly
j  enough those heads had short hair
 (and not so surprisingly, some

were blacks). We saw lots, like
the zooand the French Quarter

2 and Jackson Square, which the
r -city closed because the freaks
: wanted to sleep there.

We could write books about

';.“Mardi Gras 1970.” I think we all.
., learned much more than we would
“  have in the week’s classes we

missed. I think we learned much
more than a year’s classes could
have taught us. But then, they still

 don’t offer courses in PEOPLE.

STORY

Bill Yetto
and J. T. (Jim Turner)

r Dave was driving. The Kentuc-

 ky road was icy and we blew it:

crashing bridge, ice, thoughts . . .:
1A couple of hours out of new Or-
leans J . T. told me South Dakota

is a communist plot. Really? It
isn’t really a communist plot, but
we were coming back from the
Mardi Gras. Did it matter. The
government is paying people to
drive around with South Dakota
license plates to give the impres-
sion that‘ it really exists. Have
you ever been to South Dakota?
Anyway, Mott Fleming existed
and I could have been skeptical
about him as much as I could have
been about South Dakota. Of
course, I’ve never been to South
Dakota but I did sleep at Mott
Fleming‘s house in New Orleans
as he took his fourth wife up to his
farm and the family lived on. J.T.
added: Just try and get a plane to

South. Dakota from Pittsburgh.-

What is the capital of South Da-
kota? . . . Are you crazy? it does-
n't exist. And we walked the
streets of the vieux carre. Bieg-
nette, Pink Chablis, Coast to Coast
Wine, the band and Bourbon St. I
thought it was Pierre. At least that
is what I learned a long time ago.
Of course, it_ is all part of the plot.
like God or Campbellsburg, Ky.
And the ice is still flashing on my
mind. I might as well try and un-
derstand something as anything
else. Its all confusion anyway.
Still-life commentaries on" road-
signs. philosophies on the intraca-
cies -on how a bridge freezes be-
fore the road service: who cares?

ize how beautiful Andre was belle

It may seem sadistic to some

“that the possibility of the Univer-

 exuberant, but in a certain sense

Never ‘in my three-years here

Hopefully, it will only be a mat-

Somebody threw me a dub-
loon, a silver one. not the kind
they had in Walt Disney flicks. I
bit it. It was aluminum. J. T. turn-
ed looking down the business end
of a long French bread. The sub-
marine was docking at the wharfs:
the French Quarter "feasted. Scott
ran by with a woman on his shoul-
ders, and Bonnie became Cather-
ine Tekawitha.

BACK IN Pittsburgh, at the
other end of the phone the Gods
waited for word from their broth-
ers. The influence of Dionyses was
strong. I had to tell all those in-
sanely beautiful immortals that I
loved them. I was glad they were
in Mt. Olympus and not Mt. Rush-
more. And I love Andre. and the
retarded kid: Beautiful Belle of
New Orleans. I wanted to ask Deli
if she was happy. We gave her
beads and dubloons. She told us
she saw us in the movies. Are you
happy Deli? Andre said thank you.

At night Mississippi could be
any other place. Walter Cronkite
lied. In the day, off the main high-
way. you see their shacks. And in
the day you see the white man-
sions too. The old and new placid
where they were would make Dali

trees. road signs, complacency.
dust. The dead oak walks for love.
Mississippshas everything.

Did you ever step on a bug and
watch it squash? Dave was driv-
ing, ice roads. This bug was in-
sured. Thank God.for Campbells-
burg. "Way down South in the
land of cotton; look away. look
away!"

SOMETIMES I wonder. Some-
times I think. I" always wonder.
Sometimes I try not to think. When
I was young I used to wonder what

School 

cation is one of the last priorities
of the state and federal govern-
ments. This country's politicians
feel it is much more important to
fight useless wars and spend bil-
lions on defense than to educate
the youth in high schools. colleges
or even through educational tele-

vision. ‘

But I feel those old politicians
realize they are on their way out,
and have become extremely scar-
ed. A few years ago. they wouldn't
have had any trouble appropriat-
ing money to the University. They
could have either raised taxes or
cut state appropriations to ,wel-

fare or something, and the voters ,

would have accepted the results’
with the indifference that has al-
lowed this country to become the
repressive state it now is.

"The times. they are a chang-
in"‘. Dylans says. and he seems
to be saying something the old po-
liticians have already realized.

THEY MUST know that the GI's

in Vietnam are not only wearing
love’ beads and smoking pot. but
bringing their ideas (and some-
times their dope) back home.
They must be aware of the fact
that resistance to the draft has
rapidly spread to the reserves,
and reservists are now trying to
get out as conscienscious objec-
tors. They must .be aware of the
fact that the 18-year-old vote will
be law in this country in the next
few. years. They must be scared!

It's a shame that many students
here may have to go elsewhere for
the remainder of their education,
but the awareness they gain will
far outweight the inconvenience of
transferring.

If students just realize they

I

was real. Mott Fleming was real.
White hair. long white beard. Nich-
olas du belle ville. You are real
Mott. Can you teach us anything?
Mott's friend was black. Mott told
us he was "agood nigger." He'd

even go to California with him’

where he is not a nigger. They both
laughed and Mott offered every-
body liquor on his lawn. Blazing
New Orleans sun. Chinese erect-
ed mansion for Mott hovering over
us. “If you tell somebody insane
to do something he can't do. then
you’re more insane than they
are." And the parade two blocks
away screamed with drunken
merriment. This is our life: this
is our heritage. Why didn’t we go
through Customs? Rednecks. Red-
necks. Mott. is it true that you're
Robert E. Lee's grandnephew‘?
Why won't you talk about it Mott?
Is it because his niece married a
black? Teach us anything Mott.
Mott got kicked out of North Car-
olina University in‘ 1916 for long
hair. Thank you Mott.

Mississippi is real. So is the
Mardi Gras. The South is real.
Mississippi is not a Mardi Gras.
Sometimes I try to think Missis-
sippi isn't real. I want to fuck
somebody in Jackson. Maybe then
it will be real. Impressions are

everywhere. I tend to think of the
suggestive and not the concrete.
but it is concrete. It is there.

Easy Rider was St. Louis‘ Cem-
etery in New Orleans. St. Louis
Cemetery was us. Bones rattling in
the air. old cracked monuments
reaching toward the sky. French

what we shall be remembered by?
Will God kiss these stories in 1970?
A nice place to trip. We have all
become God. The gates closed at
4:30 but they were always there.
Were out gates closed when we
were born? Sometimes I try not to
think. Sometimes I. try not to
think". »

THESE ARE the lost pictures
of a gone world. This is the last
testimony of our ghost bodies.
This is Cynthia‘s last kiss on my

stomach. This is the moon.,This '

is America. I don't know if this is
the world. It is not the universe.
Sometimes the universe smiles.
The road is our education. Every-
one will be our epitaph. Tell me
that love exists and I might be-
lieve you. Tell me that God exists
and I might cry. Is God behind my

eyes or between my legs? Show -

me the way and I might laugh. At
night" Mississippi could be any
other place.

Chicago’s Zoo Closes;

Animals Locked Up

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

It appears that the longest zoo session  history is reaching
its culmination point now that Chief Kangaroo, Julius the Just, has
given over the fate of the Chicago Conspiracy Seven to the jury

Point one: what does a possible conviction for the Bobby
Scale and fellow-defendants portend for the future?

The charge against them was "conspiracy" and “crossing
state lines with the intention to start a riot."

Although the dictionary definition defines conspiracy as “a

portanti ,-

secret agreement among men for evil purposes," it seems that it
is not a pre-requisite in the Chicago case that the conspirators
conspire together. (According to Abbie Hoffman, a recent visit-
or to the University, the eight men had not all men one another
before their group trial. l

Therefore, the trial in Chicago is trying the seven (Panther
Bobby Seale serving jail sentence for contemptl for their com-
mon state of mind rather than conspiracy. '

. Taken in an historical perspective, the appearances of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. would be liable for consideration under
the conspiracy charge. It so happened that on several occasions
after he spoke in a city, civil rights disturbances brokeout.

Senator Strom Thurmond is also in danger of recrimination
since‘ his recent speech at C—MU incited a marshmallow riot. Tak-
ing the issue a logical step further, President Nixon’s foreign
goodwill mission provoked serious riots in several cities; should-
n't he be indicted under an even more serious charge since he
produced riots when traveling_across national lines?

Pointtwo: what is the meaning of self-defense in a nation that
justifies almost any crime on the basis that an individual has the
irrevocable right to defend himself?

Black Pan_t_her Bobby Seale requested atthe. inception of the

trial the “privilege" of doing without legal counsel and defending ~

himself. When his motion was denied by Judge Hoffman (a Fed-
eral judge who boasts a record of’ no acquital judgments in the
last fouryears of his tenure), Seale objected so strenuously that
the judge was “forced" to bind and gag him to his chair in the
courtroom. I "I

The gags didn't suffice to silence Seale so he was sentenced
to 16 terms of three months each in jail for contempt of court, a
sentence that is not remediable to a jury because of its packag-
mg.

In subsequent decisions, all of the remaining conspirators
were slapped for contempt, including the defense attorney, Wil-
liam Kunstler, who got the heavist rap. ‘ .

So it appears that the understood law of self-defense is depen-.

dent upon whomis being tried.

One of the painful ironies of the whole situation is rests in
the sentencing of the defendants’ lawyer for contempt, a person
brought in to relieve Judge Hoffman's agitations- for "an orderly
court.“ « '

_ Even if the conspirators had agreed to play the court’s game
with the court's rules, the cards would be stacked against them.

' The trial-travesty evokes many additional questions about a na-
tion leading a double life: one based on the concepts of freedom

. and democracy, but operating by oppression. L A _
But the Conspiracy’ trial made one thing very clear: that one of.
" yvhich.,‘the_ ,- -

Panthers Begin "Road
Cagers Face Possible “Pressing”
Situation At Baldwin-Wallacel

by BILL NAAB

Tonight when Coach Buzz Ridl’s cagers oppose a smaller
and younger Baldwin-Wallace quintet in Berea, Ohio, the Pan-
thers will try to assume the bully role.

Bill Clark, coach of hosting Baldwin-Wallace, announced that his

, I starting lineup will consist of two freshmen, one sophomore, one junior

and one senior. Dave Martin’s 65”‘ frame will be the tallest of the five

‘starters. Martin, meanwhile, has been averaging 17 points a contest

(a nick better than Kent Scott’s
16.9 average).

“Youth and inexperience have
been our biggest problems thus
far. Yet, we've grown-up some
and have been getting valuable ex-
perience as the season has pro-
gressed,” Clark remarked.

The Ohioans maturation pro-
cess, however, hasn't yet ap-
proached the stage that would
force a rival coach to quiver and

Show” Ending

depth to pour the pressure on the
opposition.

“They’ve been using about ten
players a game, and a number of
substitutes can keep the team go-
ing full-speed throughout ‘the
game,” Ridl explained.

The Panthers, in the meantime.
have been gearing their offensive
machinery to tear apart an ag-
gressive man-to—man defense in
addition to a frequent full-court
press.

“I wouldn't be surprised if they
throw the_full—court press at us,"
said..Ridl. “After last week our
guys should be pretty confident
though. Baldwin—Wallace‘s quick-
ness could possibly slow-down our
fastbreak against the press, but if
we keep proper floor position, I
think we can rattle them."

Yet, Ridl indicated that he does-
n’t anticipate another point-burst-
ing output. Bot-h the Panthers and
Baldwin-Wallace move deliber-
ately, looking for the open shot.
The cagers, nonetheless, will rap-
idly race toward the basket in
combating a full-court press.

Rival coach Bill Clark realizes
the Panthers’ ability to run-over

shake in preparation for an up-
coming battle; Baldwin-Wallace
has compiled a poor 6-16 record
this season.

Coach Ridl, no doubt, expects a
Panther victory. But, he will not
be sufficiently relaxed to nap on
the bench.

Baldwin-Wallace may not have
much experience or victories in
the sack. but they can utilize their

 

MIKE PATCHER battles for rebound in last week's loss to Georgia Tech at

the Field House. The Panthers have completed their home schedule with a

7-3 record and will finish the season on the road. The first of the five
games is against Baldwin-Wallace tonight.

The cagers’ big win over Syrac-use Saturday night still
keeps their hopes for a .500 season in the realm of possibil-
ity. With five games remaining, Buzz Ridl’s team stands at
8-11 and needs four wins in the last five games in order to
break even.

The unfortunate scheduling, however, finds the cag-

his young squad.

“Pitt’s been running well re-
cently (against Syracuse), and I
know that their defensive variety
will pose a problem,” Clark ana-
lyzed. ,

It’s evident that he has no inten-
tion of chalking-up a digit in the

victory columns—at least not until
Wednesday night’s contest has
been decided.

“I have the utmost respect for
Buzz Ridl, and I’m not particular-
ly surprised by Pitt’s record (8-
11). I knew that his team would
make progress,” Clark said.

In order to make continued pro-
gress toward a .500 season, Ridl
might attempt to equalize the
pressure within the Baldwin-Wal-
lace field house by frequently in-

' serting his own relief men-Bob

Cizmarik, Jerry Causer. Bill
Downes. and Mike Riggle.

To Swim Wins

Rick Rowe "Freestyles

by JERRY MYERS

After spending the first half
of the season filling in for Tom-
my Hays (who had a bad foot)
in the short races. sophomore
Rick Rowe has returned to doing
the things he likes best—swim-
ming the 500 and 1000 yard free-
style events.

Rick. a native of nearby New
Kensington. swam at both New
Kensington and Lower Burrell
high schools. Coach Grant offered
him a scholarship to come to Pitt
and he is now one of the top swim-
mers on the tanker squad.

Rich. while a freshman. set
three new freshman records that
will now stand immortal due to the
fact that there is no longer a fresh-
man team. He also holds marks in
the 1000 yard freestyle. the 200
yard freestyle and the 400 yard
freestyle.

Moving up to the ‘varsity ranks,
Rick established a new school rec-
ord in the 1000 yard freestyle
event just last week with his time
of 11:09.2. He is basically a long
distance man and doesn’t relish
the sprinting events too much.
Now that Tommy Hays is back, he
has returned to the longer races.

Questioned on how Pitt. after
losing by 11 points to Grove City.
can demolish Youngstown. who
themselves beat Grove City, Rick
replied. "Coach Gran'ts line-up
did the trick against Youngstown.
The meet really comes down —to
how you can switch your guys
around so you avoid the other
team‘s best men and place your
best swimmers where they can
scoref'

The Grove City meet presented
added problems because of the
fact that it was away. "The pool
there doesn‘t have any gutters
which cause a lot of backwash.
Also the straight sides are very
tough on the butterflyers and the
breast strokers." 6

Rich outlined the implications
of the loss to Grove City. “The
loss really hurt our record, not
just for prestige matters, but for
recruiting as well. There were a
lot of recruits at the meet on Sat-
urday though.”

In addition to the added depth
of the squad this year, Rick attri-
butes much of its success to the
presence of assistant coach Dick
Bradshaw. "We've improved a lot
under Coach Bradshaw." com-
ments Rowe. "He's really brought

the team together." Bradshaw
swam in both high school and col-
lege. going on to gain coaching ex-
periences both at Bethel Park
High School and in Qhio.

The big climax to this season
willbe the Eastern championships
to which the Panthers will send
about 12 men. The only person to
qualify for the Nationals has been

Dave Wessel. Rick is very confi—_

dent that by next year there will
be a lot more Pitt swimmers in
these ranks.

Most Teams Idle Until Saturday

There‘s no action in Pitt sports
until Saturday. with the exception
of the basketball activities.

The varsity wrestlers (9-24

are idle until their home match‘

against Syracuse, the final Field
House meet of the season.

The swimmers (3-4) also host
Syracuse in their next action Sat-
urday at Trees Pool.

The gymnastics team (2-6) will
tangle with the powerful Penn
State gym team in Trees Gym
while the other action occurs.

And Jim Banner's tracksters
(2-0) will have a busy afternoon's
action. A number of the thinclads
have been invited to compete in
the New York Olympiad in Madi-
son Square Garden.

The  track squad, a new in-
novation this year because of
frosh eligibility, will also compete
Saturday morning at the Field
House. ’
