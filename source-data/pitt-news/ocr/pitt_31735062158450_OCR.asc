Set Parties
For Fresh

Tonight senior‘ mentors and
their mentor groups will at-
tend the Panhellenic Recep-
tion and Open House from 7
to 10:30 p.m.,‘ at which time
these women will be formally
introduced to the sororities on
campus. ’ .

First they will go to Stephen
Foster Memorial. Then they will
be able to visit four sorority resi-
dences and meet with girls from
eight ‘of the 16 sororities. '

The purpose of this open house
is not to ‘rush freshmen and trans-
fer. women, but rather to get ac-
quainted with them and give them
an opportunity to get acquainted
with those in sororities. ,

The mentors and their groups
will then visit a half hour with
each of the four houses.‘Each
mentorgwill be accompanied by
a sorority~woman. During the
reception at Stephen Foster the
latter will be "seated with the
mentor and her group, and she
*will' accompany. them to the
houses.

Since this is a formal gathering,
sorority women will wear cock-'
tail dresses. Freshman women,-
mentors, and transfers should feel

comfortable in wool dresses. -

‘EIJitChfiéld Analyzes Soviet Education

 tor the

Says Schools Employed

For .World L Domination
Reveals Widespread llnterest in Culture;

Finds Evidence of Intellectual Isolationism
By ROSALIE GLAND

I

The Soviet school system isan essential vehicle forvthe

realization of their objective of world dominance. This ob-
servation was emphasized by Chancellor Litchﬁeld in his
Fall Convocation address “Are. Soviet Universities a Chal-

lenge to theyUnited States.‘ . . ,
i 4 Before a —gathering of faculty, administrators, and stu-‘

dents in Soldiers’
Memorial Hall, the ‘ Chancellor
analyzed higher education in the
Soviet Union by relating obser-
vations he had made during his
recent ‘Russian tour.

Litchﬁeld ﬁrst presented his ob-
servations of generalconditions of
Soviet society.

_ Impressed by Culture

He was impressed by the wide-
spread interest in cultural affairs.
As examples of this he cited the
cultivation and public support of
theater, ballet, and opera; throngs
of museum visitors; and patron-
age of Soviet bookstores.

There is a clear evidence in
many parts of the country of
the intellectual isolationism in
which the people have lived for
so many years. For example, he
found little evidence of any
familiarity with recent develop-
ments of such a politically neu-
tral ﬁeld as administrative sci-
ence. .

A third condition he referred to
was “the dynamics of the atmos-
phere’-’ or the noticeable convic-
tion of the people that they have
contributed much to the world.
There is an apparent feeling of
success, pride, and sense of des-
tiny that provides an important
general stimulation for the~peo‘ple.

Have Competitive spii-it
~A- closely related condition is

the prevailing competitiveness,
not only that of y individual
against individual, ‘but that of

the group against an established
standard. The signiﬁcance of this
competition is that it stimulates
eVer—greater eﬁort.

The Chancellor was impress-
ed by another universal aspect
of the Soviet system, the recog-
nition of an important role for
women in society. ‘Women are
in every ﬁeld and virtually
every level within each ﬁeld.
This is particularly true in edu-i
cation and ' the medical pro-
fession. A C _

He _also noted a tremendous
program of plant improvement
underway in the Soviet Union. He
commented on the vast array of
new‘ apartment buildings extend-
ing for several miles along the
highway from the airport to Mos-
cow.

Only One View

tLitchﬁe1d‘ marveled at the ex-
tent that absolutism inﬂuences the
patterns of thought- and daily liv-
ing. “There is only one right
view, not only in political mat-
ters, but in every aspect of life.’.’

Finally the Chancellor com--
mented on the disparity be-
tween personal and public stan-
dards of living. Personal living-
Standards are sacriﬁced‘ in favor
of public standards.  » ‘

education, beginning with signiﬁ-
cant advantageous achievements.
Enjoys Prestige '
The most signiﬁcant aspect of
higher education in the Soviet
Union is the prestige it enjoys
and the constant support it can
command. It is held in the highest
regard by all portions of society.
Faculties enjoy prestige sec-
ond to no other professional
group in the Soviet Union.
Basic salaries are among the
highest in the nation. “Teaching
is the -—‘chosen profession’.”
The premium__placed on higher
education also’ results in plant
and equipment expansion and im-
provement. Libraries and labora-

‘V

-tories especially beneﬁt from this .

premium. . -
Student Is Hero
Students have a high regard for

university education. In turn, the .

public has high regard for the
successful student.

In the Soviet Unionthe hard-
working and superior student
is regarded and spoken of as a
“hero.” Too often, on ,U.S. cam-
puses, and more particularly

secondary‘ schools, he may be '

referred to as a “grin'd.”
Higher education in the Soviet
Union provides. extensive oppor-
tunities for women. Thirty-ﬁve
per cent of the faculties are wom-

en..Fifty—one per cent of the stu- ‘

dents are women, In medicine, 69
per cent of the students are wom-
en. In the ﬁeld "of engineering,
women comprise 39 per cent of the
student body.

ness of Soviet commitment to
higher education is found in the

Scholarships

For Graduates

Applications are being ac-
cepted for the 1958 Rhodes Schol-
arships. They must be submitted
to State Secretaries of the Rhodes
Foundation no later than. Nov. 5,
1958.. . "

Dr; Courtney Smith, president
of Swarthmore College and Amer-
ican secretary of the Rhodes
Scholarships, has announced that
the annual value of the scholar-
ships has been increased to about
the equivalent of $2,137.50 in
American currency.

This sum, an increase of about
$427.50 over the previous stipends,
will be paid annually to Rhodes
Scholars in residence at Oxford
University. President Smith indi-
cated that the increase makes the
scholarships sufﬁcient for all nec-
essary term-time and vacation ex-
penses of the «Scholars.

Since l903,'wl1en the Rhodes
Scholarships were established in
the will of Cecil Rhodes, famed
developer of South Africa, the
United States has sent 32
Rhodes Scholars to Oxford Uni-
versity every year.

For purposes of Rhodes selection
the United States is divided into
eight districts, each of which
names four scholars.

Students Get Aid
-The ﬁnal signiﬁcant achieve-
ment of Soviet higher education is
i that 80 per cent of the students
are’ assisted ﬁnancially ‘ei_t,her in
whole or in part.’
7 The ﬁnal part of the address
' was devoted to those aspects of
Russian education the Chancel-
lor consideres disadvantageous
or ‘objectionable.

T_.heir basic philosophy of edu-
. c-ation is unacceptable."We in the
* United States emphasize the.im-
potrance of the individual. The
. object of Soviet_ educationis to

.9 quickly turn out trained people
in a given ﬁeld. »

A Some Rejected

i The most obvious difference be-
A ‘tween the two systems is in ad-
f  missions policy. The Russian Min-
"istry of Higher Education rejects
many capable people, not because
of their inability to proﬁt from
higher education, but because the
, Statejias no speciﬁc and defined
 need for them in ﬁelds in which

«the quotas have been ﬁlled.

The Chancellor also objected
to the overspecialization, -rigid
curricula, and great gaps in
subject matter prevalent in Rus-

‘ sian ‘education.

In his conclusion the Chancel-
lor .reiterated the fact that both
the methods and products of the
United States and Russian educa-
tional systems are completely dif-
. ferent. However the Russians

v work harder to achieve their pur-
.. P°5e- " ‘
