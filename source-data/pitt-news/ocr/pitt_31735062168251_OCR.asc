by CARL VAN HORN
“Unless we get the com-
munity to understand the im-
portance of the institution (the

University of Pittsburgh). we -

are not going to get any state
money for you.” These feelings
were expressed by Represen-
tative Lee Donaldson. the
House Minority Leader, at the
"Legislative Day" held here
Friday.

Campus Tour

The 18 Representatives and
Senators from the General As-
sembly of Pennsylvania who at-
tended the one-day forum arrived
Friday morning. They toured the
campus. observing the "talking

‘ ‘ typewriter" and an open heart op-

eration by Dr. Bahnson. Some of
the Legislators remained for an
hour in the operating room obser-
vation deck. but one or two felt
the need to leave earlier because
the experience proved to be too
much for them.

After the surgery. the Legisla-
tors and their wives ate lunch in
the Babcock room on the -10th
floor of the Cathedral. While
there. Chancellor Posvar outlined
the University's Campus Growth

plan by using a large. scaled mod-_

el of the Oakland area.

The visitors then proceeded to
the English Room for a Student
Affairs Panel discussion. Daniel
.\/IcF‘adde,n. executive assistant to
the Assistant Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs. made the opening re-
marks to the men. urging "an

‘ open. free—wheeling session."

Fred Robie. director of Admis-
sions. discussed the admissions
process and cited the increase in
enrollment of students from low-
er income families since Pitt be-
came state-related.

C an argument.

Grants vs. Loans

Charles Dees. director of Fin-
ancial Aid. distributed a fact sheet
on aid at Pitt and listed the cri-
teria that are considered before
awarding scholarships and loans’
to students. Dees emphasized.
"It would be detrimental to the
general well-being of all concern-
ed if the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania terminated its scholar-
ship program in favor of one util-
izing loans." Many state lawmak-
ers are now favoring a loan pro-
gram instead of the present state
scholarship program. "We can no
longer get our constituents to sup-
port what they don't believe in.“
Senator Elmer Hawbaker explain-
ed. Dees concluded his presenta-
tion by saying. "A loan program
would have the effect of perpet-
uating an elitist society in that
only those that could afford to in-
cur debt would be inclined to take
advantage of such a program."

Student Government (SG) Pres-
ident Lenny Klavonic began the
student discussion by introducing
the other students present: Di-
anne U|yo_n, Scott Baum, Carl Van
Horn, and Michael Edelstein. Kla-

vonic mentioned a new “social
awareness” in the college gener-
ation and their “desire to com-
municate with and influence leg-
islators through the system.” Be-
fore Klavonic could complete his
remarks, however, one of the lee-
islators said, “All you want to do
is influence us to help you andno
one else.” From this point on the
discussion was truly a “free-
wheeling” one.

Scott Baum. former SG presi-
dent. suggested that the legisla-
tors increase state aid to higher
education. Baum insisted. "You
must assume the responsibility
for this. whether your consti-
tuents agree or not." Representa-
tive Burkhardt from Penn Hills
pointed out that.already 56 per
cent of the state's budget is spent
on education. "Where will we get

' the rest of the money and who will

pay the taxes'."'__Burkhardt que-
ried. Baum replied. "Tax corp-
orations like Jones & Laughlin

that pollute the air and water of

Pittsburgh." Senator Hawbaker

., replied by suggesting that Baum

was "attacking the capitalistic
system." Baum disagreed.

The discussion returned to the
topic of communication between
students and legislators. Carl Van
Horn and Mike Edelstein outlined
their proposal for alegislative in-
ternship and student liaison in
Harrisburg. This met with the ap-
proval of Representative John Pit-
tengeij of Lancaster. who said.
“We are the orphans of politics.
People must begin to take an in-
terest in and get an understanding
of our state government."

‘Community Turned Off’
Many of ‘legislators mentioned
an uncertainty on the part of their
constituents as to the value of the

college education. Rep. Lee‘Don-
aldson addressed himself to the
problem: "The people of this state
will not support what they don't
believe in. and right now they
don‘t believe in higher education.
Like it or not. the community has

been turned off." The group con- "

cluded that more interchange be-
tween students and legislators
was essential for understanding.
However. it was obvious from the
results of the meeting that much
misunderstanding still exists be-
tween the two groups.

Chancellor Posvar opened the
next forum by giving the lawmak-
ers a "brief. whirlwind tour" of
the Lfniversity. He outlined the
programs in education and re-
search that the University main-
tains. Posvar also emphasized the
tremendous economic impact that
the University has on the sur-

doah, featuring ‘soloist Gary Cum-
mins. _ v

The Club will also perform for
15 minutes each at two prelimin-

 ary events which are scheduled to
’ be broadcast to the eastern half

of the state on Friday night and

ii early Saturday evening.

Representing Pitt at the Pag-
eant is Johanna Seddon, Miss Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, 1970.

Johanna. a chemistry major
and-an April. 1970. honor grad-
uate ‘at Pitt. plans to attend Pitt
Medical School in the fall.

If she wins the $3000 Miss
Pennsylvania title. however, Jo-
hanna will postpone her studies
until the following year in order to
participate in the Miss America

 Pageant held in Atlantic City dur-

ing September and to be active -in
public relations and service ac-
tivities which the Miss Pennsyl-
vania title entails.

will feature talent presentations

rounding community and the tri-
state area. Following this. ..,the
Chancellor and other administra-
tors were questioned about the
type of education the University»
provides. Sen. Hawbaker ‘-a';g~ain
assumed the role of questionner.
"Do you educate students in prac-
tical topics?” Dean Jerome
Schneewind of the College of Arts
and Sciences (CAS) briefed the
men on the courses in "contem-
porary issues" that are planned
for the fall. As one would expect,
the topic turned to student dissent
and the disciplining of students.

Rational Haven

Dr. Posvar noted that ‘‘while B

many students adhere to the phil-
osophy of anti-rationalism, few of
these people can -be found at the
University of Pittsburgh.” One

 The Most Evil
Human Being Yet

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

The first time I saw him he was working in the cafeteria and
- -I didn’t exactly know what to make of him. I was into'one of”those
‘ “establishment” things and he became a symbol of ‘fcoppmg out.

.. But then, it might have been a result of my paranoia. In those
‘ days, I had just achieved the commuter’s fantasy - living in the free
world of an apartment.

But with freedom came the poetic hardships; I began more and
more to miss “-Mom's home cooked meals” and I was low on mon-
' . ey-chronically. '

So I scrunged up a ‘meal ticket and passed through checkpoint
Charlie undetected, except for him. .

I always had the feeling that he knew. I was awaiting for the
day when he would turn me in.

That day never came. He had other designs.

A His style finally came home when he approached a friend of
mine who was a “hippie”. Decked out in beads, bells and a wide
1- _ brimmed felt hat, he cornered berinarecess of the cafeteria.

He was perceptive as hell. He “laid a rap” on her, digging
«into her fears about her femininity. He was a humanitarian; he would
help her out. _

A ‘few hours later,-. she related the whole deal to me. A few
hours after that she realized what had been pulled on her.

My turn came up within ten days. Just enough time to let
things cool off and just enough time for him to change his approach
‘ and tailor it to me.

I suppose I came across as an intellectual then — you know. . .
how did Sartre get from.existentialism to Marxism. . . . important
life questions.

His approach to me was more “spiritual": “I’m confused about
myself; Could we get together to talk?”

His costume bad altered this time around: modified bells,
shorter hair, collegiate sweater. But, as often happens, we learn
through our friends. And I was wise to him.

. But I agreed. It was sadism perhaps . . or maybe vengeance.

I saw him other times. He let his hair grow long again for

V I watched his progress and the lengths he went to for a “score”
with a growing sense of dread.

He was the most evil human being I had ever encountered.
And then I finally discerned his secret.

ever, had other plans.

I ran into him one night in the early ‘Fall. The weather was in
the midst of alterations. It was rainy, and cold, a rather approp-

Is Syndicated Columnist .,
Another "Polysyllabic
Ambiguity Squat/ulcer?”

by WILLIAM J. McCLOSKEY
Contributing Writer

The idea was recently enun-

.ciated in a nationally syndicat-

ed column. Virginia Payette’s
COMMENTS, that a college
student owes society a debt once
his education is completed; that
is, upon the reception of his
diploma.

Observe the needs of truth in
that premise, then read on and
marvel at this woman’s mastery
(mistressy?) of- the art of dis-
tortion. It turns out that the day
you clutch that diploma in your
hand:

—— Your “four-year respite from
responsibility“ is terminated. '

— You owe society—“family,
university and tradition"-—a debt
which she sets at roughly -35,-

_ 000.

— Although society (as defined)
does not expect a -35,000 cash
reimbursement for its pains, it
would appreciate your joining
"the rest of us in our daily
struggle to preserve the system
that helped them (you) get
their (your) education."

Other things you should know:

"It would be nice if just one
commencement speaker could
find the courage to list a few

ways the class of 1970» can justi- -

fy the time and money and faith
invested in them."

 . . it was the Establish-
ment that’s_ responsible for their
freedom to go to college in the
first place.

“And, finally, someone should
tell them that piece of parch-
ment should remind them that
they’re now members of society
them selves.  '

Poor, misguided women.

6‘

Agnew is one thing. There are
animals that can be taught to
perch on a podium and squawk
polysyllabic ambiguities. This
Payette woman is supposedly
one of your highly-paid, clear-

-thinking priestesses of the truth

and an‘ important molder of
opinion.

It troubles me that people of.,
her ilk insist on imposing mater-
ial criteria’—like diplomas and
do1lars——on their frequent analy-
ses of life, happiness, peace and
education.

But leaving all that aside—and
that’s doing a lot—who is she to
tell you when you’re a member
of society? And what right has
she to tell you what debts you
owe and howto repay them‘?

Her. COMMENTS is nothing
more than an uncommonly ex-
plicit statement of one of the
“Silent Majority’s” favorite
whisperings—that since you and
I fail to conform to our betters’
obviously correct norms of
thought and behavior, we simply
do not belong in society, and
won’t until we get our minds
right.

All this from that same stratum
of the hierarchy that took patriot-
ism, the American Flag,
wisdom in all things as their
propertydand theirs alone.

It’s bad enough that a sub-
stantial portion of the popula-
tion (perhaps a majority, in
fact) chooses to think that
way, but ‘somehow you and I
have allowed ourselves to acqui-
esce. «

We answer our critics’ abuse
with a lot ‘of whining about ali-
enation, repression, oppression,
intellectual servitude, and the
rest of it. We’ve allowed our-

selves to agree with them that
we must earn our right to speak
out, and -that we must prove
our competence to vote.

Every breath you ‘draw and
every thought you think, however
offensive to the Agnews and
Payettes, proclaims you a mem-
ber of the community of man
(which is, I think, a better trans-
lation of the word society).

If it must be a -battle for our
birthright, let us at least fight
it intelligently. As long as the
Payette types continue to func-
tion and prosper, it looks bad
for our side. I’m afraid we’ve
made a tactical blunder in ac-
cepting the underling role that’s
been thrust upon us from above.
Let’s hope it’_s not too late to
get out of that corner.

Tuesday, June 9, l970——THE PITT N.EWS—-Page 

Deeper Issue Involved Than Petty Battle  

(Editor's Note: The column from Miss Ulyon is
in response to an opinion piece written by two
leaders of the enyironmental teach-in organiza-
tion on" campus, Stu Kislinsky and Marc Hiller
after they were unsuccessful in gaining an aflo-
cation from the Committee on Student Organiz-
ations. The authoress, a past chairman of the
‘CS0, offers an explanation for the move. The
tfirst article appeared in the May 29 edition of
The Pitt News.)

by DIANNE ULYON

The crisis which Stu Kislinsky and Marc
Hiller feel they are facing in their attempt to
receive recognition and funds from Student
Government (SG) for Zero Population Growth
-is symptomatic of an issue deeper thanvtheir
petty battle with the Dean of Students Office
and SG.

The salient issue brought to light by their
situation is one which faces those .who gov-
ern this University at many levels: How is the
University to respond to the development of
new organizations whose membership and
structure deviate from’ the traditional student
organization?

I served ‘as chairman of the Committee on
Student Organizations (CSO) at the time
when the current by-laws were written. Only
with a predominantly undergraduate member-
ship and all undergraduate officers can an or-
ganization be recognized and financed by SG.

Furthermore, it is the negligence of the

CSO—~not the Dean of Students or the SG Of-
fices—which has postponed hearing any appli-
cations for recognition until September.
I defer to those involved in this situation
with Zero Population Growth to educate these
gentlemen. on the facts and to take action to
remedy the postponed schedule of CS0 cre-
ated by that committees shirking of its re-
sponsibilities. -

This article is intended to suggest that this
case could set the precedent for dealing with
the new types of organizations which are
emerging today.

The philosophy common to these groups is
to mobilize opinion and action on a topic of
their concern.

To achieve that mobilization students. fac-

ulty. administrators. students of other univer- '

sities. and members of the general commun-
ity are encouraged to join forces.

These organizations can direct themselves
to an immediate goal and disperse as quickly
as they organized; or they can form a more
permanent structure around a steering com-
mittee. (The organizational president is be-
coming a passe figure in these circles.)

They seek rooms to reserve that will be
conveniently located and capable of servicing
the gamut of lectures. small dialogue sessions
and major teach-ins that are concomitant to
acheiving their mobilizations goals.

Given these factors which characterize
these organizations and their needs for funds
and facilities; the University often finds itself
being looked upon as their sanctuary and sal-
vation. '

- But how is the University to respond—the
Office of Student Affairs. CSO. SG. et at—un-
der current procedures for‘student organiza-
tions or under new procedures which are ye
to be determined? -

By maintaining the current procedures the
University consciously or unconsciouslyis
asking that these organizations restructure
themselves to conform to those procedures.
Such a restructuring would necessitate the
formation of a student-affiliated branch con-
sisting predominatly of undergraduates and
with undergraduate officers—to qualify under
CSO procedures.

1 ‘Yet even if a student-affiliated branch is
formed, what proportion of programming
funds will the Allocations Committee agree to
finance? A percentage proportional to the
number of University undergraduates in the
organization? Would funds be allocated on an
item-for-item basis with only certain expen-
ditures being considered legitimate? Would
the students be allowed to pool their funds into
a city-wide organization account?

And. how would a request to use a room
be responded to? How would the organization
be defined for this purpose—as a student or

as an outside group‘? This would effect wheth- ‘

er or not a rental fee is_charged.

Perhaps the hottest question in this issue ‘_

is how would University regulations be en-
forced during events sponsored by these or-
ganizations. g

Would all those in attendance be subject to
University regulations. enforcement poli-
cies, and disciplinary proceedings‘? Would
the city usurp all University jurisdiction

‘ tion in such instances? Or would jurisdiction

be determined according to what individual
violated a regulation——a student or someone
from off-campus? How would students from
C-MU or Duquesne be disciplined?

It seems complicated enough to deal with
jurisdiction over individual violations—but
what if a general disturbance breaks out?
What role would be played by the Student Af-
fairs staff, the Campus Security officials, and
civil authorities?

These are interesting questions to which
no one can offer an answer at this time. «Try
a member of the student Affairs staff or the
Lniversity Counsel.)

Kislinsky and Hiller have failed to see the
issue beyond their own noses; I wonder how
many others have failed to see it?

Since the first Vietnam Teach-ins ten
years ago in Ann Arbor. Mich.. no one has
denied that there is a new wave of ideas and
goals in this generation of college students.

Whileythis generation is traditionally iden-
tified with its methods of collective dissent in
marches and demonstration, it is time that
those of the traditional bureaucratic order
realize that there is emerging a new concept
of organization which finds it difficult tore-
late to the more highly-structured and static
forms of the past.

The case of Zero Population Growth is one
case in many which have faced and will con-
tinue to face this University's bureaucracy.

This is a challenge to the Establishment
which is more subtle than the threats of/con-
frontation politics which make the headlines. ‘

Will anyone here .dare to meet this chal-
lenge. or is even such subtle change con-

strued as a threat?

Misquoted  

Editor. The Pitt News:

On returning to Pittsburgh from
New York today. I picked up the
June 5' issue of The Pitt Newsin

which I read "Petition seeks Jew- j

ish Holiday."

I recalled giving Steve Lubet-
sky my own comments last Thurs-
day over the phone.

I was therefore shocked when
I read the last paragraph of the

article. .. _ 

On the whole. the article was I 
quite well done but I would like to .

explain what actually was said
over the phone. _

I did not say that "Forcing the

administration to close on Yom I 

Kippur is only a first step. we
hope to include all holidays even-
tually." e

What I told Mr. Lubetsky was

that I was confident that classes I if 

would be closed on Yom Kuppur.

My references to the other holi-

days referred only to the other

High Holiday. Rosh Hashanah. At I i
. this present time I continued. can-

cellation of classes on this holi-
day _would not be feasible.

Perhaps during: the telephone
conversation our wires got cross- ‘
ed but anyone that knows me per‘-'
sonally. Jew and non-Jew. knows

that I would notmake the state-
ment found in the issue.
