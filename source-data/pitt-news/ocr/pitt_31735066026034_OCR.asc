Penn State
bled more
than Pitt

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

“I had a lot of friends who
gave [blood] this year and
didn't last year,” said Hayley
Soffer, a member of Alpha
Epsilon Phi sorority. However,
they did not give enough to
outbleed college rival Penn
State in this year’s Pitt/Penn
State blood drive.

For two years, Pitt has consis-
tently donated rnore blood than
Penn State in spite of the larger
student body at Penn State. But
it ended this year when the
pints were counted. Campus-
wide, the Greek-sponsored
event drew 2,953 units from
Pitt donors compared to 5,288
pints taken from Penn State
bodies.

Jill Yoseloff, a chairperson for
the blood drive at Pitt, did not
Comment on the turnover.
Yoseloff did say that Pitt’s
Greeks and Central Bloodbank
will hold two more drives —-
one in January and another in
March of "95.

Dave Edmunds, senior con—,
sultant for Central ‘Bloodbank,
said that Penn State beat Pitt by
collecting 1,300 pints in the
final three days of its drive. “It’s
tremendous. I take my hat off
to them,” Edmunds said.

Fewer people at Pitt donated
blood this year -— nine less
than the previous year’s 2,962
participants. Even so, Edmunds
said that most students were
aware of this year’s drive.
“They’re just not the same peo-
ple as last year.”

According to'Edmunds, there
was a lack of consistency with
the donors at Pitt this year.
Greeks collected 1,360 units,
down 60 pints from last year,
while residence halls brought

New strategies
to improve TA
productivity

By Paul Grubbs
Staff Writer

Their plan is to make
Teaching Assistants better.

The Office of Faculty
Development will release a plan
to enhance the ways in which
graduate students are trained to
teach. This plan is based on 10
years of reviews conducted by
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Graduate Council.

The purpose of the review
was to monitor the training pro-
grams of TAs and to provide
suggestions to strengthen the
overall quality of TA instruction.

The TA Task Force, headed
by Dr. Brenda Manning, coordi-
nator of the Office of Faculty
Development, first met in June
of 1992. The task force members
include staff from the Office of

, Faculty Development, members
of the FAS Graduate Studies and
representatives, mostly TAs,
from over half a dozen universi-
ty departments.

According to Manning, TAs
were on the task force from the
beginning. She stressed that this
was an important step in the
planning process.

"The TAs are a crucial part of
the university,” Manning said.
“We need to encourage them
more in their teaching. The bot-
tom line is to make TAs better
teachers.”

The best way to do this,
Manning said, is to have direct
contact with the faculty.

“Each TA should be observed
each term by a member of the
faculty, and that faculty member
should be able to directly and
immediately provide feedback to
the TA.”

’ Manning said this has been
done before, and the results
have been good, but due to

Let yourfingers do the walking during registration time

By Jennifer Sikora
For The Pitt News

Pitt students may be able to schedule
classes by_touch-tone telephone in a
few years, if this type of registration
proves itself worthwhile to the universi-
ty‘. .
The Electronic Delivery of Student
Services Committee is investigating col-
leges and universities that already use
phone-in registration. Committee
Chairperson Joe Gil said the group
must find out if the technology is both
suitable and compatible with Pitt’s
existing computer system.

“The next step is to visit other univer-
sities who have phone—in registration,”
said Fred Koloc, committee member
and director of CAS Advising.

On Dec. 14, members of the commit-
tee will visit Penn State to investigate
its telephone registration system.

Penn State has been using phone—in
registration for the past four years for
students to find alternate courses when
other classes have closed. Beginning
spring term 1995, phone-in registration
will be used to schedule all classes.

“For the last eight or 10 weeks, stu-
dents have been calling the system to
register for classes,” said J. James
Wager, Penn State’s registrar. Wager
said students receive instant feedback
about their course status while they
register over the phone.

A pre-recorded voice tells students if
they have made a mistake or if the
class is closed. The words used by the
computer are pre-recorded and stored

in the computer. “The messages are
custom made to the dialogue that is
taking place,” he said.

Even though students register by
phone, Wager said students are strong-
ly encouraged to meet with advisors to
go over schedules and have alternate
courses waiting in case classes are
closed. .

To avoid the problem of thousands
of students calling at once, Penn State
spreads student calls out according to
total credits earned. “We decided that
was the fairest way to do it at Penn
State,” Wager said. “We start with those
students who’ve earned the most cred-
its.”

If students call before their scheduled
days, the computer will recognize this
and the students will not be able to

register.

Wager said Penn State is looking for-
ward to meeting with Pitt’s committee
members. “Since we’re not going to
square off on the football field any-
more, we’re going to square off in the
meeting room. We’ll have some good
discussion about this type of system.”

Ohio State University students also
register by touch-tone phone. After a
pilot project in the fall of 1987 proved
successful, all colleges in Ohio State
University became involved in phone
registration by the spring of 1988.

Ohio State’s assistant registrar, Cathy
Williams, said the university uses a sys-
tem called BRUTUS (Better Registration
Using Touch—tone telephone for
University Students).

December is already upon us,
and as we head into the last few
weeks of the term time
becomes more and more of a
precious commodity. This is
especially true for those of you
set to graduate this month or
next April. And in the rush to
get those final papers and tests
out of the way, the last thing
that you probably want to think
about is your job-search carn-
paign.

Do yourself a favor. Plan to
devote at least some of your
time during the coming
Christmas break to finding a job.
Even though on-campus recruit-
ing will not resumehagain until
January, there’s still plenty of

things that you can do until

then.

Before you pack up and head
for home, take inventory of
your job-search tools: resume,
cover letter, -employer contact
list. Does anything need a sec-
ond opinion? If in doubt, stop
by the Placement Service and
meet with your counselor. We

  College Republicans end semester with a

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Politics, religion and the
Equal Rights Amendment were
all discussed at last Monday’s
College Republicans meeting
— the last one of the semester.

Chair of the Pittsburgh
Republicans Committee John
Robert Clark gave the Pitt
Republicans reassuring "post-
election news. “The election
was not your fault,” Clark said.
“I’m sure you did all that you
could. When I was [president
of Duquesne’s College
Republicans] in 1980, I never
thought there was going to be
another Democratic president
—— especially someone like
Carter.

“What I told my members
back then is what I’ll tell you
right now. In four years
[Clinton] is going to be gone,”
Clark said. “The Republicans
are the future.”

Clark then gave the
Republicans two choices in
strategy. “We can either join

time constraints it is difficult to
provide such‘ “mentor—like”
instruction.

“The Plan,” as the OFD is call-

‘ ing it, lists recommendations for

not just departments but also the
administration and the OFD
itself.

Manning said that the existing
structure should not be changed.
“We can and should work with-
in the existing structure.”

Other recommendations
include:

-TAs who are independently
teaching their own course, as
opposed to just teaching a
recitation section, should take an
accredited teaching course if
their departments do not have
one already.

-All departments should pre-
pare a written document on
department TA policies.

-Every department in Faculty of
Arts and Sciences should have
an orientation program of some
kind.

-The senior Teaching Assistants
should take part in orientation
programs to be able to pass
along previously learned experi-
ence.

-Departments should hold train-
ing seminars for all new TAs.

Reports have stated that the
orientation programs for TAs dif-
fer according to individual
departmental needs.

Dave Rudge, TA consultant for
the OFD, said, “Since about 25
to 50 percent of the courses in a
state—funded school like Pitt are
taught by T As, it’s important that
adequate education is provided
for all the money being paid
each year by parents in tuition.”

The OFD’s summary of FAS
programs also listed problems
cited by TAs. Rudge, calling it a
“clearing house,” said that indi-
vidual departments can use the
Office of Faculty Development
to “compare different plans from
other departments.”

Steve Parks, president of the

break  in Fort Lauderdale
when they celebrate, possibly
womanize a little more, or we
can sit back and reorganize.”

Clark suggested that the
College Republicans use the
student directory next semester
to poll and then recruit new
members.

The national election had
Clark defending the
Republican campaign. “There
was no memorandums going
around [in the White House]
saying ‘Dye your hair, Mrs.
Bush. Look young. (30 on a
bus trip. Hold your husband’s
hand. Pretend like you’re dat-
ing again,”’ he said.

“I wouldn’t doubt that
[Clinton campaign manager]
Jim Carvel gives Hillary a
memo saying to have a baby
while she’s in the White House
and make it like a Jackie
Kennedy situation where a
toddler is worth 20 million
votes.”

Clark said the one way to

get pro—life activists to favor a"

liberal is to have a baby. “And
don’t doubt Bill Clinton’s

 

potency,” he stated.

Clark also discussed the ben-
efits of Senator Arlen Specter"s
re—election. “You would’ve had
a lot worse with that leftist
[Lynn Yeakel].

“Specter spent 11 years sell-
ing out. He gave into the pro-
choice groups, the homosexu-
al activist groups. He gave
labor everything they wanted.
Then when it was time for
labor to pay him back when
they got a real Democrat liber-
al, one of their own kind, they
screwed him,” Clark said.

According to Clark, the new
focus of local Republicans is
the Pittsburgh mayoral race.
Clark said that current
Pittsburgh mayor, Sophie
Masloff, will be a tough oppo-
nent to beat. “The lady hasn’t
been stupid. She held the line
on taxes, and she cut city
taxes during her first term. So
she’s hard to run against,
unless you want to run against
the fact that she’s the poster-
child for Altzheimer’s disease.”

Religion was the next topic

   STUDENT

GVERNMENT

in Clark’s speech. "There has
never been and will never be
a separation of church and
state. There is nothing in the
Constitution or in case law
stating this.

"When your professors get
‘schmucky’ with you, saying
that there is a separation
between church and state, say,
‘Dr. Jones, prove it!’ Don’t fall
for their trash,” he said.

Further tying politics to reli-
gion, Clark said, “You’re going
to see Clinton’s Theocracy of
Atheism when he starts taking
funding away from the
Catholic, Jewish and other reli-
gious groups.”

Clark gave his opinion on
women’s rights. “We don’t
need an ERA for women to be

‘equal to men. They’ve always

been equal. There would be
no men without women, so
we are quite equal.”

Clark said there were over
800 laws passed giving women
special protection while no
laws were made giving men
protection.

“Government always gave

few words from Clark

 

women a special place in soci-
ety because women were once
reverenced.” he said. “Now
they’re abused."

Clark was remorseful of the
destruction of women’s roles
in society. “Now we want to
get them shot on the front
lines and crazy things like that.
They're trying to dehumanize
women as much as possible. It
goes back to Planned
Parenthood who want zero
population growth; and to
defeminize womanhood is to
make women not want to con-
tinue our population as part of
their function in reality.”

College Republican President
Kevin Docherty discussed the
group’s plans for the spring
term. Plans include members
going to New York City to see
the Rush Limbaugh show and
bringing high-ranking
Republican politicians, such as
Dan Quayle and Jack Kemp, to
address the organization.

“We’re looking forward to
next semester, and of course,
to celebrating Clinton’s presi-
dency,” Docherty said.

Registration

Continued from page 1

Each student receives a
“window time” to call in
and register. Williams said
the window time sets up a
priority system with stu-
dents; better priority is
achieved by calling close to
the window time.
Graduating seniors, handi-
capped students and ath-
letes are allowed to register
first.

Williams said an algorithm
set up inside the system
“maximizes the student’s
schedule” by giving alter-
nate courses to closed class-
es so each student receives
the best schedule possible.

“It’s very complicated to _

explain; it’s very technical,”
Williams said. She said
about 90 percent of Ohio
State students use BRUTUS
and almost 100 percent of
undergraduate students par-

ticipate.
“We’ve received an over-
whelmingly positive

response from students
because they don’t have to
wait in line,” Williams said.
“It’s so easy to use. It’s so
user-friendly. It tells you if
you makea mistake.”

Williams said she still
receives complaints about
classes closing, but calls that
an administration problem,
not a fault in the computer
system. She said she also
hears some students saying
BRUTUS’ digitized voice is
impersonal. A

“Our goals were to make
scheduling easier for stu-

dents,” Williams said. BRU-

TUS also provides a better
way for the administration
to ‘track student requests
and roster information.

Kent State students regis-
ter by touch-tone telephone
over a six-week period.
Registration is broken down
according to class level:
graduate students first, then
seniors, juniors, sopho-

: “We hope to put a proposal

mores and first-year stu-
dents.

Each class level gets one
week to register, and each
student has a two-hour time
period to call in and sched-
ule classes. The time slots
are based on the last two
digits in the students’ social
security numbers.

After the six-week prereg—
istration, personal registra-
tion is made available for
students who want to add
or drop classes or for those
who still have not regis-
tered.

Kent State’s assistant reg-
istrar, Mr. Barrett, said the
personal registration will
probably go to phone regis-
tration by the fall of 1994.
Barrett said about 88 per-
cent of Kent State students
use the university’s phone-
in system.

After Pitt’s committee vis-
its Penn State, it will
reassess its observations,
Koloc said. “My understand-
ing is that at this stage,
we’re investigating if
[phone-in registration] is
worth doing  We really
want to look at other
advantages involved in the
whole package.”

Gil said the committee
found the cost of phone
registration systems ranges
from $50,000 to $250,000.
“We don’t know what the
cost will be. The administra-
tion will have to weigh the
cost against the advan-
tages.”

Pitt senior Stephanie
Bearse said she is not
happy with the current reg-
istration system. “Offering
more classes and phone-in
registration would help a
lot.”

Many students expressed
their interest in having tele-
phone registration at Pitt.

from the year before. Benedum
Hall and students of the
Nursing School donated more
blood this year; Pitt’s Law
School dropped from last year;
and faculty and staff donors
increased their total from last
year by 28 pints.

Although results from the
Pitt/Penn State blood drive
come on the heels of Penn
State’s 57-.13 mauling of the Pitt
Panthers two weeks ago, this
competition is different from a
ballgame. Edmunds said,
“Blood’s blood. Everybody
benefits from this drive;
nobody loses.”

Campus safety  

Time and time again we hear about how unsafe the
University of Pittsburgh’s campus is. The Student
Government Board has addressed the question, as has
the university administration. Both have made a lot of
headway on this issue and made the university com-
munity much safer for students. Unfortunately though,
it still looks as if there is a long way to go.

Two nights ago, the safety of one of our editors of
The Pitt News was put in serious jeopardy. After having
called the campus van several times and waiting for
over an hour, the student was forced to walk a friend
home around 1 in the morning. After having arrived at
the residence of the friend, this student walked back to
North Oakland by himself. He was soon met on
Bayard Street by a black sports car which followed
him for several minutes. Eventually the car pulled
along side of the student, and the individual inside of
the car proceeded to make several sexual and threat-
ening remarks. .

If the student hadn’t run into two innocent
bystanders coming home from a convenient shop at
that late hour, it is scary for us to think of what could
have happened to him.

Some would say that there was no reason for him to

' be walking alone at this time of the night. Perhaps this

would be true, if it weren’t for the fact that these two
students had to wait for over an hour for a campus
van which never arrived. Besides that, it was the day
when everyone returned from Thanksgiving break. It
is .hard to imagine that on that night the ‘campus van
wasso busy that it would take over an hour for it to
(not) arrive. V g

__realize _t_h_at it _is impossible for the campus police

i  an camptls-i"AS§.s.:1i?iﬁ3  are

evening, there‘ will always be perverted incidents like
this one happening. And while it is the job of all stu-
dents to be responsible and not walk alone at night, to
waitan hour on a campus, which covers no more than
five square miles for the campus van, is inexcusable.
It’s kind of sad that students who come to this uni-

. versity and have more important things to worry

shuttle’ route, which is scheduled to run 24-hours a
day, and the suggested professional management of
the campus van should go a long way toward protect-
ing students. While we applaud the SGB and the
administration in their efforts, we hope they will stay
focused and continue fighting for this issue. Many stu-
dents come to Pitt because they are worried about
their future —-— part of that includes being safe. We
encourage the Board of Trustees to approve these pro-
posals.

Mt. Graham could be monumental

“Not everyone can be
happy all of the time.” These
are words to live by. Hell,
even I’m not happy some-
times. Now I’ve seen this
expression redefined. Now
I’ve seen people who are
never happy.

The people to whom I refer
are the individuals who
staged a protest some time
ago on the William Pitt Union

‘lawn. Their protests were

aimed at the university for its
funding of a telescope which
will be erected on Mt.
Graham.

The reason they are op-
posed to this funding is that
Mt. Graham is sacred ground
to certain American Indians.
You may have run into one
of these New Age-minded
reactionaries as you made
your way around campus.
They want -you to jointheir
fight to cripple the astronomi-
cal community. Don’t sign
their petitions.

The American Indians have
taken one crushing defeat
after another in their fight to
preserve their identity in a
nation that has apparently
forgotten the indigenous pop-
ulation’s right to its home-
land. This cannot be denied.

Strangely enough, the
Indians see this telescope as
yet another destructive blow
dealt to them by “White
America.” Why? Of all the
people in the world who
should appreciate this tele-
scope the American Indians
would seem to be the most
supportive. How’s this, you
ask? Don’t tell me. The pro-
testers didn’t tell you?

Allow me. This is no ordi-
nary telescope. This telescope
will answer one of the most
pertinent questions of astron-
omy since Galileo first gazed
at the night sky and ques-
tioned the origins of the uni-
verse. The telescope on Mt.
Graham will be the first and
only telescope able to actual-
ly see other solar systems! To

date, astronomers have spec-
ulated that systems other than
ours exist. But due to circum-
stances too complicated to
explain here, no device creat-
ed by man has ever been able
to see these systems. That
could all change.

Unless these folks succeed
in convincing the administra-
tion to withdraw support for
this project. Indians are a

Diersen

spiritual people. This is a
spiritual im‘atter.. This tele-
scope could open doors to

finding life-on other planets-

and increasing our knowl-
edge of ourselves and our
universe. How can these peo-
ple be opposed to this? It’s
beyond me.

As for their arguments —
I’ve listened, and I’ve given
them their due consideration.
Not one of them justifies the
halting of this monumental
effort.

“Why Mt. Graham? There’s
a mess of other places the
telescope could go that aren’t
sacred Indian ground.” First, I
can’t imagine a group of edu-
cated individuals gathering
and deciding to build a tele-
scope on sacred ground sole-
ly to forsake the Indians.
That’s preposterous.

Secondly, I’m not a scien-
tist, but I’m sure that Mt.
Graham wasn’t decided upon
as a location by some roll of
the dice. To the contrary, two
obvious reasons are Arizona’s
lack of cloud cover and the
towering elevation of Mt.
Graham. It doesn’t take a
genius to understand the sig-
nificance of these two factors.

“If this telescope is built it
will most definitely mean the
extinction of the Mt. Graham
red squirrel.” Well, what can I
say about this one? This point
barely merits response. No

matter what they tell you,
they cannot predict the
future. Nor are they any more
qualified to do so than the
average layman. Yet they
insist that Pitt will be respon-
sible for the extinction of this
particular rodent.

So where do we put the
telescope? If it’s not the Mt.
Graham red squirrel it’s the
spotted owl or the .blue—bel—
lied stinkbug chigger or some
other beast.

Now I read that there is to
be a debate between these
reactionary folks and the
astronomy department. Oooo

. this should be good. I’ll
-keep my eye on this one. I
hate to say it, but I would
have to admit that these folks
have overstepped their
boundaries.

They have made a grave
mistake in pitting their forces
against the cognitive, scientif-
ic minds of Pitt’s astronomers.
If they have any feeling at all
for these misguided individu-
als, the astronomy department
will call this debate off. I hate
to see people ruthlessly
debased. Well, not really.

Chancellor O’Connor, you,
as the rest of us, are human.
Humans make mistakes.
Please rise above your
humanity just this once and
use your clout as chancellor
of our university to simply
tell these people: '

“No. We will not withdraw
our support for this telescope
on Mt. Graham. I realize that
this will not make everyone
happy, but making people
happy is not my job. Doing
what is right for the university
community is my job, and I
believe that this is a good
project that merits our sup-
port. There is no change in
plans for the funds intended
for the telescope on Mt.
Graham. Just thought I’d let
you know.”

Pitt pride. Two words not
seen together for nearly a
decade are back — at least for
one game.

Looking like a man with a
mission, Sal Sunseri stressed the
absence of those twonwords at
the Panthers’ weekly press con-
ference yesterday. Pitt’s young
interim head coach also vowed
that the meaning of the words
“Pitt” and “pride” would break
their 10-year hiatus this
Saturday against Hawaii.

“[The Panthers] are ready to
go and play with pride — Pitt
pride,” Sunseri said of his
team’s status heading into this
Saturday’s game. “The most
important thing is effort, pride
and execution. We’re ready to.
get things done.”

Making his first appearance
as Pitt’s temporary head coach,
Sunseri was upbeat.

“I’m excited to have this
opportunity,” Sunseri said. “It’s
a heck of an opportunity for a
young man of my age.

“But I’m not politicking for
the job [Pitt’s head coaching
vacancy, left by the resignation
of Paul Hackett last week],”
Sunseri added. “My job is to get
these young men ready to play
a game of football.”

Sunseri said he hopes that his
philosophy on how to play the

A game will rub off on the team. A
“It’s my personality to attack,

to be aggressive,” Sunseri said.
“\X7hen I was here [1979-’81] we
were 33-3 and played‘ in a bowl
game every year.

“These young men must
understand that through hard
work, desire and preparation,

they will. get those opportuni-
ties [bowl gamesl,” Sunseri said.

Admitting that he did not
have a lot of physical talent,
Sunseri said his mentality and
heart helped him on the field. It
is those intangibles that the for-
mer Panther linebacker would
like to see emerge among the
current Pitt players against
Hawaii.

“If you play excited, play to
the maximum of your ability
and play with your heart,»you
can get things done,” Sunseri
said.

Getting things done is what
Sunseri wants to do this week-
end, but he denied any future
coaching plans at Pittsburgh.

“You have to be wanted at a
place,” Sunseri said about being
selected as a head coach. “If
you are wanted, you will be
here.”

Search for new Pitt football coach begins

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

The Pitt Athletic Department announced on
Monday the formation of a Screening and
Advisory Committee to assist in the selection

of a new head football coach.

R_epresenting‘a potpourri of university
departments past and present, the 12—person
board will work with Director of Athletics
Oval Jaynes and Chancellor J. Dennis

P O’Connor in naming Pitt’s.31st head coach.

The formation of the committee, which is
headed by Jaynes, is the first step in the
process of replacing former head coach Paul .

Hackett. ~ -

Hackett resigned Nov. 25 amid speculation

that he would be fired.

“Right now, we’re going to sit down with
the committee, with a resource group, and try
to determine a short list of candidates that we
feel will meet the ideal of what we’re looking
for,” Jaynes said. “I feel very strongly that it’s
important that you get the input in from the
number of different groups represented by the

committee.”

While the search committee is in the early
stages of the search — filtering through a sea
of possible candidates — Jaynes hopes to
move quickly in finding a viable replacement

for Hackett.

“I think that the quicker we can get some-
thing done, the quicker we can get some sta-
bility in the program and also address the
areas of recruiting [in the coming year],”

Jaynes said.

The optimal candidate for the job, according
to Jaynes, is a man with the experience and
dedication to succeed both on and off the

field. That means a high-standards, high—pro—
file coach with a solid Division I head—coach—
ing track record.

But if none are available, assistants are not

Though several names have cropped up in

‘the rumor market this past week, including

“We haven’t approached any candidate, offi-

Sunseri hopes for return of Pittpride against Hawaii

Sunseri has been here since
1984 as a graduate assistant.
Knowing Pitt’s system inside
and out, he will try to represent
the Panthers as well as he can.

“The most important thing is
having a chance to go out
there, at this point in time, and
represent this university the
way I want to represent it,”
Sunseri said. “That’s very, very
simple. We’re going to go out
and play very excitable football,
play with a lot of energy and
play with great effort.

“That’s the thing —— we are
going to play to the maximum
of our ability. That’s what I
want to get done.”

If he gets things done, which
Sunseri did in his playing days,
the Pitt football team should
have a more intense look.

“If you play with enthusiasm,
and if you play with energy,

and if you can get things done
through your heart, you’ll make
plays on that football field,”
Sunseri said.

Whether Sunseri can make
the whole Pitt football team
believe his philosophy is still
up in the air. Sunseri even said
that he does not know how his
players will respond.

“I don’t know if I can,”,

Sunseri said about getting his
players in touch with his foot-
ball mind. “I know one thing
— I got one chance to do it,
and I’m going to give it my
best.” _

Giving it his best shot is what
Sunseri said he is set on. He
did it on the field as a Panther,
and he will try to do it off the
field as a Panther head coach.

“Somehow, someway, I want
to bring pride back to Pitt,”
Sunseri said.

Patrick Division-leading Pens get A- for first 26 games

By Jim Clark
Staff Writer

The Penguins’ season is a
little more than a quarter of
the way done. Over their 26
games so far, the Penguins
have posted a 17-6-3 mark
and have a big lead in the
Patrick Division.

For the sake of comparison,
Pittsburgh held a 13-9-4
record after 26 games last
season. The following is a
report card on how the
Penguins havefared so far
this season.

Offense:A
Once more, the Penguins

are a scoring machine. Center

Mario Lemieux is the league’s
leading scorer with 29 goals,
36 assists and 65 points. Left
wing Kevin Stevens has 37
points despite missing nine
games due to a knee injury.
Right wing Rick Tocchet has
36.

Two ‘surprising contributors
to this year’s offense are Ron
Francis and Shawn
McEachern. Francis has
undergone an offensive resur-
gence with 28 points while
McEachern is among rookie
leaders with 24 points,
including 14 goals. He is tied
for the league lead with five
game-winning goals.

And where there are sur-

prises there are disappoint-
ments. Right wing Jaromir
Jagr has not elevated his play
to the superstar level many
thought he would this year.
Jagr has managed only nine
goals and 27 points so far.
Defense: B-

The Penguins defense is
either very good or very bad.
Twice the Penguins have shut
out the opposition, yet
Pittsburgh has lost games this
year by the score of 8-0 and
11-3.

Leading this inconsistent
group is Larry Murphy.
Murphy is onceagain playing
a strong, two-way game
although his goal production

has dropped. He has man-
aged only four goals so far,
none in the last 12 games.

The Samuelssons (Ulf and
Kjell) have been the
Penguins’ best defensive
defensemen this season. Both
are plus performers and both
have played a mean, aggres-
sive game in front of their
own net —— with Kjell collect-
ing 52 penalty minutes and
Ulf a team—leading 106.

Jim Paek has also played a
steady game so far. He is also
a plus player.

And if there is a disappoint-
ment on the blue line, it
would be Paul Stanton.
Stanton has played well

defensively, but the Penguins
know he can produce more
offensively than the one goal
and five points he has man-
aged so far.
Goaltending: A

Unlike last year when Tom
Barrasso seemed to coast
along with the rest of the
team in the regular season,
this year he seems to be play-
ing with a purpose. He has
two shutouts, 15 wins and a
3.30 goals against average.
There have been games this
year where he has carried the
team to victory.

Ken Wregget has done ade-
quate as a back-up with a 2-‘

Jaynes said. “I haven’t

noticed the other day on
the TV  they asked him

about [the Pitt job].

‘‘He was more interested
in playing the Cleveland
Browns — and rightfully
so.”

As far as the prospects of
interim headcoach Sal
Sunseri in the head coach
sweepstakes, Jaynes dis-
missed the outcome of this
Saturday’s game at Hawaii
as being a make-or—break
test.

“All your actions are

Jaynes said. “[Butl I don’t

sion one way or another.”

Pens

Continued from page 7
2-1 record in seven games.
Coaching: A-

Scotty Bowman obviously is
making the right decisions for
Pittsburgh to be off to such a
fast start. He shortens his
bench, using the best 14-15
‘skaters throughout the game
rather than using all 18 avail-
able as Bob Johnson did. He
also has used various line
combinations successfully,
depending on theusituation.
Special Teams: B

Power Play: A

Even though the power
play has struggled lately, it is

still the league’s best.Tocchet'

(10 power play goals),
Lemieux (seven), Stevens
(seven), Francis (three) and
Murphy (one) make up the
fearsome first unit. When a
second line is necessary,
McEachern, Jagr and Joey
Mullen have been capable,
combining for nine goals with
the man advantage.

Penalty Killing: C

Despite a fast start at killing
penalties, the Penguins have
slumped terribly here. The
injury to Dave Tippett hasn’t
helped matters. Mike
Stapleton, Lemieux and
Francis have been used up
front killing penalties while

.the Samuelssons and Murphy

have been the defensemen.
Still, the Pens have allowed
54 power—play goals, only
three less then they have
scored.

Overall Grade: A-

What can you say? There
are some problems, but the
Pens have been one of the
top two teams all year, and
their longest losing streak so
far has been only two games.
Unless a catastrophic wave of
injuries strikes the team, the
Penguins look more than
capable of winning the divi-
sion and advancing far into
the playoffs.
