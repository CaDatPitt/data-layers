With Chancellor John G.

Bowman buying the ﬁrst

stamp, the Defense Stamp
drive began today, the ﬁrst
step toward its goal—every stu-
dent in the University buying one
25c defense savings stamp each
week. ,

In the elevator ‘lobby on the
ground floor, committeeumembers
have set up a stamp sales booth

built as a miniature replica of the

United States Battleship Iowa,
which is now under construction.

The Iowa i-s the symbol of the funds

to be obtained from the sale of de-
fense stamps.

The sales today will be made by

committee members under E.dwin_

Klein, BA42, chairman of the sales
committee. Beg-inning March 4, one
of the thirteen women's fraternities
will take charge of sales each Wed-
nesday, and will compete for high
sales honors.

llllllllllllllHilllllllllllllllllllllllll

  

Herbert Gall, M43, Present chair-

man of the committee, originated

the idea. Many volunteers have ap-

plied for sales, publicity. and sec-‘

retarial positions in the last two
Weeks.

With an unlimited supply of 25
cent stamps and free stamp book-
lets, the committee is prepared for
a large volume of sales today.

“There is no reason,” said Klein,
“why students should not buy at

71¢

least one stamp each week, espe-
cially when you consider that this
is an investment that pays off at
33% per cent." _
To help students keep their book-

‘ lets handy, holes will be punched
in the booklets to ﬁt notebooks.

Although no deﬁnite plans have
been announced, a national drive
is expected to be launched as soon
as the local campaign begins to
show favorable results. '

It was a gray, rainy day outside on Monday, February 16, when
University students and faculty men sat and watched volunteer members’
of the faculty print names, addresses, and descriptions on green and
white cards on the third national registration day of World War ll. Regis-
trants sat at long benches in Foster memorial social room waiting, as ,
use student above had waited, to be called to separate desks where
volunteer registrars ﬁlled out the two important cards.

Registration Figures Exceed
Expectations, Says 0

Selective service registration ex-

ceeded all expectations Monday at

the University precinct. Chief Reg-

members were
benches, back to back. One student
said as he entered the room, “It
looks like a railroad depot in here.”

istrar J. G. Quick had to send for
more certiﬁcates of registration at
noon.

Over 400 men had registered at
noon according to Mr. Quick. At
no time during the day was the
Social room of the Foster memo-
rial empty.

All male citizens and aliens, be-

tween the ages of 20 and 44 were
required to register on this third
national registration day of World
War II.‘

Eight desks were placed in po-

sitions around the room. Behind
these desks volunteer members of
the faculty served as assistant reg-
istrars.

Hiram Milton, C42,

denounced the present student gov-
ernment set—up as “intolerable,” in
9. statement explaining his resig-

nation from the assembly.

Milton’s statement was intended
as a reply to the “what can‘ they
gain” question asked earlier in the

week 'by SFA president Ed Tait, in

which Tait inferentially questioned
the political sagacity of Milton’;
move.

The complete text of Milton’s
statement follows:

Many students have asked why
Independents resigned from SFA
last Wednesday night, and what
they expect to gain by their action.

The immediate reason was the
action of the assembly in setting
the date, for the plebiscite on the
“equal representation” amendment
to coincide with the spring elec-
tions——the purpose of this being
two-fold: first, to try to defeat the
amendment in the confusion of a
regular election campaign; and
second, if it were passed in spite
of this obstacle, to delay its going
into effect for thirteen months.

To understand what the Inde-
pendents hope to gain by resigning

 4 one must ﬁrst understand their po-
. litica'l,status in SFA.

the power that should go with this
responsibility.
lndependent representatives can
do nothing but present problems
and proposals, only to see them de-
feated by the fraternity clique.
There is but one solution for the
problem—give -the non-fraternity
student an equal voice in student
government. Give us the power and
we will accept the responsibility.

International Relations club will
discuss “Planning the Peace” at its
open meeting at 1 o’clock tomorirow
afternoon in room 216 Cathedral.

Frederick C. McKee, a member
of the Carnegie Foundation Com-
mission to Study the Organization
of Peace will be the guest speaker.

McKee, treasurer of the Interna-
tional Free World association, is
nationally known for his participa-
tion in the world-wide peace move-

ments. He has often appeared at ~

the University, and has spoken at
Town Meeting forums.
Tomorrow’s meeting marks the

cbssions at the University

Two cards had to be filled out
for each registrant. One, a green
one, contained information which
is sent to the local draft” boards.
The other card, a white one, was

' given to the registrant to be car-

ried at all times as proof that he
registered. About 20 minutes were
required for each registration.

Robert Bennett, M44, Said after

he had ﬁnished registering, “If

  
   
  

they want me they can have me,
but I would like to ﬁnish school
ﬁrst.”

Serial numbers will be assigned
two weeks from next Monday, on
March 9.

Those who registered Monday
will not be drafted until all 1-A

Strong Ohio State Squad

Snaps   Pitt Swim Streak i -

By  CERCHIARA

Too much Ohio State; that’s the
doc'tor’s_ diagnosis of P—itt’s'\'a1'sity
s-_wi1in1‘ning'team's defeat in last
Slaturday night’s meet." From first
splash to lastgeventdt was a case of
toolnizxliy Buckeyes ﬁnishingaliead
the field. .
 Captain Herb Cosgrove, of
t:he’- home forces, was abl.e to solve
the riddle. Cosgrove, a specialist in
breast stroke swimming, crossed
the line first in the 200 yard event.

 Sprinter -Gus Wilde ran into a
-little bad luck when he was shad-
_ed in both'the 50 and 100 yard

races by the Ohio representative.
’ lt took a new pool record to beat
_ Wilde in the latter race; his time
{was a creditable 55:5 bu-t his "op-

ponent Leitt negotiatedthe distance
in 55:4. ,

Coach Ben Grady said after the
meet, “'.l‘he ﬁnal score is 60-24 in
favo1' of Ohio State but I/am well
pleased with the boys’ showing.
They were up against a very ex.-
cellcnt team; one of the country’s
best.” Wh_cn- Grady said this he un-
consciously exp1'esse(l the concen-
sus of the .-'pcctators’ opinions.

- The team could not possibly have
been as badas the final score might
have indicated. They won over the

Rider’ and Penn State squads and,

will probably win _the_ remaining
swims on their schedule,’ but losing
Saturday was a matter of too much
major league opposition.

The Gold and Blue meets the
Franklin and Marshall team at
8:15 o'clock in the Pittsburgh Ath-
letic Association pool Saturday

night. Last year’s affair ended with

the Diplomats out in front 41-34.
Coach Grady believes that this sea-
son's meet will be so close that it
may be decideduby the outcome of
the relay event. I

Gus Wilde, Joe Orloll‘, Al Sam-
son, and Herb Cosgrove are slated
to swim in the relay race. F&MZ
will counter with such standouts as
sophomore Lutz, Katzenback, Mc-
Ki_1lip, and Gager. Theseiboy-s will
be supportedby Nicholas in the
breast stroke; Badoff, Eastern In-
tercollegiate champion, in the 159
yard free style event; and Keelan
in the diving trials. ‘

Ralph Mitterling, Panther dia-
mond mentor, has issued a call for
all varsity pitching and catching
candidates. Recruits are to report
to gate 3 at the Stadium, Friday,
February 20, at 3:30 o'clock. I A

Tourney-Hungry
Lions To Battle
Panther Calgers"

Coach. H. Cliﬁord Carlson. leads
his h.§.i-¢r<‘v5o«i- quintet to State Col-
lege, Pa., this week-end to avenge
an early season setback suffered
at the bands. of the Penn State
l.ions.- _ . .

Atthe. present time, Coach Law-
ther’s lads have been playing at a
terriﬁc pace and are rated the best
chance of being selected as this
district’s" representative in V the
NCAA playoffs late next month.
However, ‘a defeat at this time.by

‘ the Panthers would greatly damp-
en the hopes of the tourney-hum
J gry Lions. S I .

Paced by lanky. ‘.‘Hcrk” Balti-
moreiand co-captain Elmer Gross,
the State College aggregation has
been knocking olf the cream of the
Eastern crop with monotonous , reg-
ularity.’ As most Panther fans re-
member, it was largely through the
ell’orts of these two sharpshooters
that the Lions were able to over-
come a 20-9 deﬁcit at "half time to
trounce the Pitt quintet.

Coach Carlson has revealed that
he has devised a’ plan oi.’ attack to
successfully combat the Lion’s fam-
ed blocking zone defense that gave
the Panthers no end of_troubl_e in
the teams’ first encounter. How-
ever, the usually loquaci-ous Doctor
refuses to reveal any of.‘ the details
of his newly developed” system

SAM, ________ _ -

By-v1.\‘=(‘-E QUATRINI _ . .
After scoring another triumph in
the Boston AA. games at Boston
last Saturday afternoon, the Pan-
ther spikers will travel to Colum-

bus, Ohio, to battle the Buckeyes

from Ohio_State Uni\'e1sll._y in a
dual meet this afternoon with com-
petition getting underway‘ at 4
o'clock.

With its crack relay squad of
Stickel, Peretic, Smith and Carter,
the Jungle Cats came through
again in their second headline meet
by decisioning Manhattan. and
NYU, covering the one-mile stretch

‘in 23:27.4. However, Barney Ewell

‘proved to. be the jinx again by out-

.sprinting both Stickel and Carter
in the.50-yard dash, the only oth-
er event that the locals entered.
Carter garnered third and Stickel

. was awarded fifth place.

As the Boston. games go down in
the record. books, the Olsonmen
turn their attention. to Ohio State
which trampled Michigan State last
week-end. A full. contingent of 20
Panthers will. be‘ thrown against
the Buckeyes. This is the ﬁrst time
that the whole Panther squad, has
participated in a meet.

Highlighting the whole meet will
be the mile-relay when the Pan-
ther quartet will make a bid to
keep their victory string intact.
With the showing that the Buck-
eyes put on against Michigan, with
their team of Collins, Dupre, Ham-
mond and Owen, the Olsonmen have
an edge over the home club, in that
the locals were able to come out on
top against the East’s top relay
teams with the time of 53:27.4 as
compared to 0hio’s 3228.7 with
Michigan.

Stickel, Carter, Peretic, Smith
and Norton will represent the Pan-
__thers in the. sprints where they
will have plenty of competition
with Hammond of State. In the
Michigan State gathering last week
he whipped with case the best that
Michigan could match against him.

In the quarter-mile. race, Coach
Olson plans to run Peretic, Smith,
Wiley a‘nd Winch. Owen, although
beaten by Hanlitz of Michigan, will
be one of the stiffest barriers for

One of the hardest working and

least-publicized organizations on
campus is the Heinz chapel choir.

The 22 women and 18 men stu-
dents ‘in the choir sing the tradi-
tional religious songs so popular

all over the world. A different an- ,

them is sung every Sunday after-
noon at the 3 o’clock Vesper ser-
vices. So far this year “Guide Me
and Lead Me” by Ott, “Jesu. Joy
of Man’s Desiring” by Bach, and
“Ave Maria” by Victoria have been
presented.

Besides the regular Sunday ser-
vices, the choir performs for spe-
cial occasions such as the Thanks-
giving, Christmas, and Easter pro-
grams, Freshman vespers, and
Caritas. To rehearse for these ap-

_ pearances members meet on Tues-
days, Thursdays and Fridays from
4:30 to 5:30 o’clock and on Wed-
