End of Long Career

Dr. Clapp’s death .marked the
end of a 72-year career of service
to the University and the com-

munity at large. Beginning in 1877 .

with his graduation from the old
Western University of Pennsylva-
nia as a “ﬁrst scholar” in science,
Dr. Clapp won success in science
and business and -gained reknown
as a scholar.

In 1883, onlypsix years after his
graduation, Dr. Clapp joined with

Capt. Alfred Hunt, a metallurgist,»

to form a ﬁrm of consulting chem-
ical engineers. That same year
they merged with the Pittsburgh
Testing Laboratories. '

Shortly after the pair formed
the American Reduction Company’.
It was this company which
Charles Hall interested in his elec-
trolytic process for reducing
aluminum. This process, which
revolutionized the making of
aluminum, later changed the
Pittsburgh Reduction Company
into the Alumninum Company of
America.

Besides his work Dr. Clapp was
a collector of molluscs and his
collection, numbering 15,000 lots,
is'now a part of the Carnegie Mu-

- seum,

Twice Honored

Twice during his lifetime he
was awarded honorary degrees by
the University, ﬁrst in 1915 with
the honorary degree of doctor of
science, and again in 1947 when he
received the honorary doctor of
laws degree.

From Dr. Clapp the University

instrument of its kind in the state." f‘ 
He also donated to the University, ’
the Early. American class room,
the iron gates in the Commons
Room, the electron microscope ‘and :

‘many contributions to the Nation-

ality Rooms.

Dr.’ Clapp was a Fellow of the , 
American Geographical Society,
a member of the National Geo-
graphic Society, the Malacological
Society of London, the Concho-'
logical Society of Great Britain ,
and Ireland, the Academy of Nat- ' 4
ural Sciences of'Philadelphia, and

IN MHWNAM.

Dr. George Hubbard Cl.app was not a familiar ﬁgure to
the average student at the University of Pittsburgh. However,
his name was well known to students asa good friend and
great, bene'l’actor of the University. '

The Early ‘American classroom on the third floor; the
wrought iron gates of the Commons room; the seismological
station under the Cathedral of Learning; and the electron
nricrosc-ope are but a- few examples of his generosity to the’
physical development of his Alma Hater.

How much more he contributed to the growth of ‘our

' University will remain unknown to most of us. \Ve know that

he served forty-two years as President of the Universit_v Board

of Trustees. It is snfﬁcient to say that the University grew

and prospered during this period as. never before in its" 162
year history. ‘

We can best realize Dr. Clapp’s interest in our school -by
imagining the hundreds of meetings over which he presided
before’ we were born, in order that we and future students
might enjoy the pyramiding beneﬁts of a greater University.

To future students of the University of _Pittsburgh now
will fall the privilege of using George H. Clapp Hall, the pro-
posed new science b_uilding. It is now particularly.appropriate
that the ﬁrst new building in the expansion program will bear
his name. As students and alumni we should attempt to show
in some small measure our appreciation to Dr. Clapp by doing

all in our power to hasten the erection of this building. In this

way we may repay in part the lifetime of work ‘the driving

force’ the tremendous loyality and enthusiasm of ‘one of the

greatest graduates of the University of Pittsburgh.

Letter To
The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

The University of Pittsburgh
R.O.T.C. unit or units should be
ashamed of the impression they
_make on the public. I have seen
many students attired in the
clothes of an ofﬁcer uniform with
the emblem of R.O.T.C. on it.
Quite a number of these students
need their uniforms pressed, their
hair cut, their faces shaved, and
their shoes shined. And is it a
new Army or Navy or Air Force
regulation that a soldier need not
wear a hat on public? Most espe—_
cially, these students should carry

wou‘d indicate that they are proud
of the American uniform, instead
of like high school students with‘
the look of irresponsible abandon.

The public who meets these
R.O.T.C. students doesn’t always
realize what all the symbols mean
on the uniform. and that they are
students instead of regular mili-
tary personnel I have seen slop-
py military students being care-
fully appraised by‘ passengers-in a
streetcar and I have" also heard
whispers. by quizzical people, con-
cerning the commanding officer of
soldiers who wouldpermit one of
his men to appear in uniform in"
public looking so terribly shoddy.

Perhaps I« am -being hard on
these students, but when I at-
tended Pitt undergraduate school
uthe scholastic work didn’t weigh
so heavily, that a. haircut, shave.
shoeshine and reasonably well
pressed clothes were impossible.
‘I believe I am correct when I
state that the R.O.T.C. students
at least‘the advanced section get
payed "a monthly stipend for serv-
ice rendered. My suggestion would

used to correct slovenly appear-
ances and that the University of
Pittsburgh’ R.O.T.C. unit begin
reﬂecting some of '-the pride which
other soldiers,lboth dead and alive.
had or have in the American uni-
form.

Needs for the fall year are now

July and August will be the big

It has been found, he said, that
more people are majoring in sec-

By WILL DOERGE .

The spring training of Pitt’s
{two oldest footballers was cut
 short last week identically and
‘almost simultaneously.
: Both Tackle Sam Haddad, 28,
,letterman from New Castle, and
‘Harry Hollihan, 28, junior end
'7 from Shaler Township, underwent
:o__perations for appendicitis last
?week. A '

Haddad, who won his letter as a
“center in. 1946, was stricken at his
‘New Castle home, while Hollihan
,was’ hospitalized here Wednes-

Lday. The Glenshaw reserve turn- ,

Q-ed out for theopening practice
sessions, but complained of a pain
in his side.

Waite Discovers Ailment

‘ Trainer Howard‘ Waite suspect-
ed the nature of the ailment and
‘had Hollihan taken to the Mercy
(Hospital, where he was operated
jjfon immediately,

fj“Observers are doubtful whether
'thejntwo “old men” can make up
for lost time and make the grade
with the varsity this fall."

_On_ the bright side, "however,
‘comes the. announcement of the
‘addition of two varsity lettermen
to’ the squad. Guard Chuck
Thomas, who with Mike Boldin
saw plenty of action last season
at right guard, got into football
togs for-thebﬁrst time this week.
Thomas missed the ﬁrst week’s
practice due to a strep throat in-
fection‘. I

" ‘Hal Wertman, regular fullback
on Clark Shaughnessy’s 1945 edi-
tipn of the Panthers, also turned
upfor initial drills. The Shamo-,
kin sophomore returned from the
paratroopers, in September.

‘ Lone holdover from the T-for-
mation -regime, Wertman will
have to adjust himself to the sin-
gle wing. . ‘
 Meanwhile daily drills roll
right along, rain or shine. Last
Thursday Mike 'Milligan had his
players cavorting around the Sta-
dium ‘gym in their stockinged feet.
Following that, he and his assist-
n’ts held a long skull session with

Measles Mean
No IM Game

Measles, the three-day type, has
necessitated another postpone-
ment of the Pitt-Tech intramural
basketball game. \'

Some of the Tartan IM champs
have come down with the irri-
tating disease, forcing the delay
of the game from last Friday. to
tonight at 7:30 p.'m.

The Pitt~IM champs, the Phys
Ed Whips, will probably suffer
more than competitors, though.
Steve Pavlokovic, - team captain,
is busy with baseball practice,
as are Nicki Starsenic, and George
Stephan. Nick’ DeRosa and Nick
Bolkovac, other Whip stalwarts,
are practicing with Mike Milli-
gan’s grid Panthers. -

The Whips will all ﬁnd time,
however, to journey across the
tracks to the Tech gym tonight.
Whether they will ﬁnd‘ a spotted
Tech attack, will not" be known
until the game is ﬁnally played.

Carlson Real
Medicine Man

Pitt’s Dr. H. C. ,. Carlson does
more traveling than the old-time
medicine man and his wagonful

Carlson’s nation,-‘wide tours,
though, have no medical purposes.
All are allied with his better-
_known profession — basketball
coaching. ,
Then week before last he jour-
neyed to Seattle to attend the
National Basketball Coaches con-
ference. '
One rule change made at the
Seattle confab will effect a change
at the Stadium. Required use of
glass banking boards next winter
will give more Pitt spectators a
View of both baskets.
Other revisions of the rules deal
primarily with fouling during the
ﬁnal minutes of games.

All freshmen who would like to
play baseball for Pitt next year
are ‘urged to watch for an an-
nouncement concerning a -special
spring practice to be held this

players who were dropped from
the 1949 squad are also asked to

Relie ves Mitterling;  
Jumble: K e ystane Race

By LYNN C. WTCHELL .
Ralph Mitterling welcomed Art Barnes to spring baseball
practice last week with heaves of relief and for obvious reasons.
The Sarge has stressed power at the plate this year and
without Barnes the amiable Mitterling would be minus one of
his only two .300 hitters back lastyear. This is to say nothing
of the experience Barnes has gained‘ in two previous seasons

under Mitterling’s tutorship.

Anxiety on Sarge ’s part was caused when Art was unable
to appear for practice until last Monday because of work.

Much was expected ofiArt during the 1947 campaign but
he could do no better than post a weak average of .137. Last
year," however, he came through with a power-packed, .306,

topped only by Big Jim‘ Couch‘,¢ .

who batted .361.
Opener Saturday
As the opener with Waynesburg
on Saturday draws near, Sarge is
. . . . . . » faced with the
p r o b l e m of
. starting Barnes
at second or
. short, the lat-
; ter the position
f he played last
3 year.
. Mitte r l i n g
has ’ expressed

   

; to put
‘Barnes at sec-
ond, but if he
is unable to ﬁnd anyone to ﬁll
in at short he will have to keep
Art there and probably use Rog
McGill ,a holdover from last sea-
son, at the keystone position,

Mitterling has been using Bill
Ford, a newcomer, at short and
McGill as an understudy to
Barnes. Ford looks goods on de-
fense and can make the long
throw from’ deep short without
wasting too much time. -

Coupled with Steve Pavlakovic,
also a yearling, at third, the left
side of the diamond should hold
up when the season gets under
way. First base will be’ handled
by .Art Petrosky, a sophomore,
with reserve power coming from
either Mark Maystrovich ' or
George Stephan.

Hitting Will Decide

. Hitting in all positions will be
the judging factor. Last year Mc-
Gill appeared in only a few
games due to schedule trouble.
In the ﬁnale with West Virginia,
a doubleheader at Morgantown,
Rog walked seven times while
rapping out two hits.

The inﬁeld will undoubtedly
cause Mitterling problems as to
which combinations will work out
best. In the outﬁeld the problem

Art Barnes -

will*bei one of who to cut from‘

the squad. Much of the material
on hand is of equal,ability.

V The entire squad now numbers
in the thirties and any more cuts
will have to be made in the out-

and Coach Dr. Dave O’Loughlin
was still undecided on his opening
line-up against Bethany on Sat-
urday.

One thing is certain though,
Johnny Loestetter will begin his
ﬁrst season on the varsity team
as the No. 1 man. The ex-Shady
Side star’s booming serve and
steady all—around play has put
him at the top of the class. ’

Loestetter is one reason why
the Panthers’ hopes are high of
bettering last season’s (2-6) rec-
ord. Three weks ago he advanced

to thethird round in the national .

indoor tennis championships in
New York and Dr. O’Loughlin
feels that he will win consistently
in college play. _ .

Last week’s sunny skies helped -

iron out the winter rustiness and
the squad should be ready forthe
opening serve against the'Bison’s.

Lettermen from last year’s
team, Stan Weil, Bob Si-lberstein,
Walt Schoenberger, Ralph Mason,
and John Parker have showed
well in practice and seem as-'
sured of .regular berths. But the
other two starting positions are
still wide open. 3

How about the charge that

the reporter wanted to know.

athletes need plenty of stamina *

that a football player must ﬁrst
provide for spring and fall prac-

part in other sports.

“It is better .to give a lot of

In time, Fisher was told, the

Several weeks after the Ham-

the athletic oﬂ"1ce issued an an-
nouncement that Pitt would have
a J ayvee football squad next year.
The two events ostensibly were
unrelated, but the more-than-

It is not unknown that a jay-

teams involve much more outgo

From a spirit viewpoint, how-

Pitt Cintlermen [earl Eastern Schools
In fashions ' 73- Year Track Rating

By BOB LEVIS

When the spring track season
opens at Western Reserve on April
23, Coach Carl Olson no doubt
will have a few track statistics in‘
mind.

He should have, for the stocky
little coach constantly bears in
mind Pitt’s position on a 73-year
rating compiled by two track bugs.

“We were ﬁrst in the East,”
says Olson smiling. “And .that’s
not all, for we placed eleventh in
the country in a survey that in-
cluded 47 major universities, and
colleges.”

From Cashion Data

“This gave my boys a lot to
think about when the long trips to
Schoonmaker Hall began to get

them down, and it was plenty.

cold out there, too,” remarked
Olson. F _
Thanks to David C. Cashion and
his father, Lawrence J. Cashion
of Los Angeles, the cinder sport
has been supplied with accurate
track data on records compiled
since 1876. Pitt is one of the 47
institutions who have requested
their standing from the Cashions.

Pitt’s prominent place in the
listing has been enhanced by such
past great runners as Harold
Stickel in low hurdling and
Johnny Woodruff in the 880-yard
distance event. Woodruff Went on
to take first honors in the 880 at
the 1936 Olympics.

Stickel, yVoodruff Ratel

Stickel and Woodruff were rated
fourth in the country in these
events. Eighth place was given
Pitt in the 440-yard dash, mile
relay," and the iavelinthrow.

Most recent of Pitt greats to
win world-wide recognition and
also help in'the Cashion statistics
was Herb Douglas. Herb, while on
campus,~was a sparkplug on the
varsity with his exceptional run-
ning broad jumps.

In the" Cashions’ most recent
compilations Southern California
was rated ﬁrst in the 15 ﬁeld and
running events considered for a
place. Ohio State was the closest
school to Pitt in geographical

Three-Quarters of Students  
Want Coed Cap

75 per cent of the student body prefer Coed Cap and Gown shows.
The poll was conducted by the polling committee of Student

& Gown

taken on campus show that about

and Gown musicals failed for the
last two years. In the past, the
shows had an all male cast, with
men portraying the female parts,
writing, directing, and producing
the entire performance.

Cap and Gown did not succeed
because of the lack of student co-
operation in attendance.

About 85 per cent of the stu-
dents polled were familiar with
the Cap and Gown shows and the
majority were in favor of musi-
cals.

With the cooperation of How-
ard Davies, chairman of Spring
Festival, a poll will soon be con-
ducted to ﬁnd out student opin-
ions and reactions to it.
