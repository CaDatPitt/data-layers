Discovers Women
'Touch‘y' Subject

An Industrial Relations teacher
in the University has made a
mental note to be more cautious
in his lectures on. employer-em-
ployee relations.

One recent morning, probing

the subject of “paternalism,” he
addressed his predominantly male
class, “Many of you are familiar
with the Westinghouse girls bas-
ketball team.” _ ’

Retreating from the volume of
laughter, the red-faced lecturer
“They’re a
touchy subject.”

Following" this, he redeployed his
forces and safely negotiated the
treacherous ground.

"free reign with athletic policy

since the departure of Dr. John ,

B. (Jock) Sutherland in 1938.
After a 69-0 loss to Michigan last
October, Student Congress re-
quested an investigation of the
athletic policy. 

Chancellor _ Fitzgerald formed

the Student-Alumni Committee to’ ’ .

investigate athletics. At the same
time, the Faculty Committee on
Athletics began ‘a separate probe.

Last month the two committees
released conflicting reports con-
cerning Athletic Director James
Hagan and head football Coach
Mike Milligan. - V

‘The Student-Alumni Committee

urged the dismissal of James Ha-_

gan and the retention of‘ Mike
Milligan, while the Faculty Com-
mittee recomended the ousting of
Milligan and the retention of Ha-

Near Eastern Authority Here
To Present Zionist Viewpoint

Growing out of a request that Student Congress allow students
to hear both sides of the Palestine controversy, arrangements have
been made by William F. Saalbach for a speaker to balance Kermit
Rooseve1t’s reputedly pro-Arab speech here recently.

The Rev. Earl I-Iol1ier'Tomlin,

a leading ﬁgure among the clergy

 

 

of the Baptist church and an authority on the geography, history,

Chest Council
Refuses Drive
ByRed Cross

The Pitt Chest Council last
Thursday refused the American
Red Cross permission to conduct
a separate contribution drive on
campus but invited the national
relief organization to participate
in a composite Pitt Chest drive
later in the current semester.

Before rejecting the Red Cross
request, the Council, composed of
eight students, three representa-
tives of the University adminis-
tration, and three faculty mem-
bers, voted to sponsor two’cam-
pus. drives per year, one in each
regular semester. I

The Council met at the request
of Student Congress which, after
ﬁrst signifying in an informal vote
its intentions_of adhering strictly
to the Chest Plan rule which for-
bids separate campaigns, later
partially reversed its stand by rec-
ommending favorably to the
Council. the Red Cross request.

Appearing before the Council,
Wilber I. Newstetter, dean of the
School of Social Work and chair-
man of the Red Cross campaign at
all institutions of higher learning
in Pittsburgh, asked that the Red
Cross be allowed to conduct its
annual drive because the organ-
ization had not been notiﬁed of
the Pitt Chest Plan’s restrictions
and would not have time to change
its plans to accord with Pitt Chest
rulings.

Frederick J. Miller, executive
secretary of the Pitt YMCA, repre-
sented the World Student Service
Fund at the meeting and asked
the WSSF be granted the right to
conduct its annuai compaign if

Bitter Medicine
This business of cheating on the part of the
students is like discovering one’s face cover-

‘ed with German measles. It is ugly and un-

pleasant but it has to be faced.

For quite some time, faculty members have i
been frightened by the enormous amount of.
cheating done in classes and especially during —

tests and quizzes. The disease has grown to
the point where some measures will have to
be taken to halt it. The medicine is going to
be bitter.

Sugar coated pills will have no place in the V.

treatment. Any sort of steps taken will nec-
essarily alfect all of us. This is only fair be-
cause the trouble is the fault of all of us.

Steps taken in ‘the past have failed. Alter- 

nate test boklets couldn’t curb cheating. Hav-

ing proctors police classes didn’t stop it eith- »

er. The muted whisper, craned neck, and

- stealthy crib-notes are standard procedure for

many a class. With the way some instructors

have of grading on a curve, an illegal A for;
the person who looked at your paper may

mean a lower grade for you.
At colleges across «the country, the old hon-
or system is now proving ineffectual. Just

what the reason is for this recent increase of

dishonesty, matters little if a sure method is
forged to eliminate its results. If Pitt does

Following Through
There will be no American Red Cross Drive
for student funds on campus this year, ac-

cording to an announcement-by the Pitt Chest .

it

Council.

‘ The Council was formed to conduct one .
and only one charity drive pcrsemester among .

the student body. The idea behind Pitt Chest
is to eliminate the many demands on the purs-

'-es of the college students brought about by".

the heretofore numerous fund raising cam-

paigns. Inone drive, all the soliciting groups _

can beneﬁt from a portion of the proceeds on
a basis to be ~d-etermiinedby the" Chest Council.
' Council ’s decision in no Way closed the

i door to the Red Cross from participating in

the campus program on an equal basis with
other organizati-ons. The decision should not be

«.c=onstrued -as an unsympathetic attitude toward a

the American Red Cross. ’

Since _the ‘Chest Council hadpromised the
students that its fund campaigns would be-

the only ones permitted on campus, ‘any de-
cision other than that announced Thursday

would have placed. the group in the position;
of having collected money under false pre-_

tenses.

Student Congrcss was aware of these facts _

yet failed to assert itself. In so doing Congross

lost an opportunity to increase its political sta- —

ture.

A

Editor, The Pitt T News:

Tonight the taste in my mouth
is somewhat ﬂat. And the taste in

students is also ﬂat. ‘ ‘

At present, regarding the best

many others, I have not been able
to decide what  or policies
are best for the United States.
Therefore, I went to this meeting
with the hope that the Wallace‘
backers could dish‘ out some cold
logic which would direct my
thinking in a non-emotional. in-
telligent manner. Mrs.’ Goldworth,
a Pitt student, had her hands ful!

If this was good leadership, they
would never have lost the golden
opportunity they ‘had to really get
started and say something worth-
while. They would have brieﬂy
summarized for the 75 or so who

The commercial charge is for
students wishing to advertise a

Spring Festival Gets

 

International Flavor

Spring Festival’s “big three” executive‘ committee is adding its
bit to the world’s tumultuous spinrling by following a “Carnival of
Nations” theme. All events of the entire festival week will have an
international ﬂavor, even to the extent of being revolutionary.

Tap Day promises to have the New Look, being held outdoors
on the cathedral lawn, facing the Heinz Chapel. This event is being
given a prominence which it has deserved but which heretofore has

Friends Otter
Foreign Jobs
This Summer

Opportunities to rebuild war-
devastated communities in Europe
and to work at various projects in
North America await over 800 col.-
lege students this summer.

The American Friends, Service
Committee is sponsoring more
than sixty summer service pro-
jects for college students. Twelve
Institutes of International Rela-
tions will take students from St.
Paul, Minn., to Nova Scotia, to
develop and rebuild continental
cultures.

In the states such varied occu-
pations as rebuilding a ﬁre-devas-
tated Main-e community, building
a hostel for American Indians in
Tube City, Ariz., and the develop-
ment of recreation programs‘ in
Howland, Maine, are offered to
the student signing up with the
Friends.

College credits for Spanish will
be granted for work in the clinic
and educational programs in six
Mexican communities. In addition,
credits in psychology and sociol-
ogy will be allowed for work in
the Service Committee projects.

For those interested in indus-
try, Friends have set up an In-
terne-in-Industry project in Phil-

tively and participate in an edu-
cational program of lectures, dis-
cussion periods and ﬁeld trips.

These institutes last ten days

and are followed by seminars of
seven weeks. They are primarily -

for foreign students studying in

this country.

The Float Parade, as usual, will
herald the opening of the Festival
program. It will be followed by

the traditional aﬁairs, all having

new and international variations.
This year’s annual Carnival may
result in a coup d’etat, setting
up a monarchy here at Pitt. At
any rate “King Pitt” will be cor-
onated. This usurper will remain
in seclusion until H—hour. Amuse-
ment rides are being featured, as
well as the customary booths.
The previously unnoticed festi-

Playersi Shows Made Possbef

Not all the preparation fpr the
Pitt Players’ ,“All My Sons” pro-
duction takes place on the Foster
Hall stage. Deep down in the
Cathedral, a room built higher
than it is long houses’ a very im-
portant part of every Players
show.

The narrow, corridor-like vault
is cramped with half—built sets,
broken-down scenery, and various
benches full of carpentry tools
and machinery. Here it is that all
scenery design and construction
is carried on. ‘

At the moment, a huge house

front is propped against one wall .

next to a miniature reproduction
of it set up on the table. The
model is the brainchild of Frank
Petrilak; the life-size creation is
the result of ten days of work by
a construction crew headed by
Jim Voorhis and James Snyder.

The hear of the room supports

a massive growth of shrubbery,“

apparently growing out of the
ﬂoor, but actually stacked waiting
to be painted before it is ‘plant-
ed’ on the Foster stage. Odd pieces
of scenery jut from every cor-
ner, while half—a-dozen crewmen
putter over sawed-off saplings,
apparently bent on making Joyce.
Kilmer look like a dope.

Under the direction of Mr.
Michael DiMarco, instructor in
English, a scenery crew and tech-
nical staff numbering more mem-
bers than the cast have been
crowding the workshop for the

next week’s opening show. With
the set complete, work now will

College Script Steal

Wyllis Cooper is helping a lot of kids through co1lege——and he

doesn’t like it.

His doctor tells him he shouldn’t get excited, but everytime Mr.
Cooper thinks about how the students are milking him his blood
pressure goes up like an Arizona thermometer in August.

Here is how enterprising young scholars across the land capi-
talize on Mr. Cooper. author of “Quiet Please,” a weekly half-hour

-. dramatic show on the Mutual net-¢

work: , ..

They write in fan letters to the
network saying they enjoyed the
program and asking for a copy
of the script. When they get it,
they stick in a few ‘he saids’ and
‘she saids,’ and turn it into their
English classes as original themes.

Most of them don’t even have
the energy or brains enough to
change the names of the charac-
ters. _ '

And Wl1at’s Worse

What angers Mr.
other radio ,writers even more
than this collegiate petty larceny
is “the plagiarism extant in ra-
dio itself today—-—by people on
small isolated waffle-iron stations
who ask for scripts of your shows,
then change them only‘ slightly
and broadcast them as their own.

Normally genial except when
people are trying to get a free
hitchhike from his creative labors,
Mr. Cooper is a short, chubby,
friendly man of 48 who special-
izes in radio drama, an art which
he thinks many writers now abuse
“by trying to cut their stories in
the same old corny pattern.”

Deﬁnition of a VVriter

It is lonely, exacting work, this
framing phrases tuned to give a
picture to the ear rather than the
eye. “My deﬁnition of a writer is
a man .who hates to write,” Mr.
Cooper said.

.He speaks with bitter knowl-
edge. For a quarter of a. century
he has been putting clean white
sheets of paper into his typewrit-
er and pulling them. out again all
broke out with high-priced prose.

The ‘Council was not respon-

fying any organization of changes

'in University policy. ‘

In a’ similar situation which
arose at the University of Wash-
ington, the Red .-Cross refused to
participate in the combined drive
because of national organizational
policies and withdrew the Wash-
ington campus as a source of in-
come.

BLOOMINGTON, Ind.——Ameri-
canism, common sense, and a
broad education are the qualiﬁ-
cations necessary for a Foreign
Service ofﬁcer, according to Theo-

dore C. Achilles, chief of the State
Departments Western European
division. A

Mr. Achilles discussed the life

and work in the Foreign Service -

at a meeting sponsored here by
the Institute of Training for Pub-
lic Service.

Ernie Pyle would have made
an excellent foreign service oili-
cer because he lived his faith in

the American way of life, Mr,

Achilles stated. He also stressed
the importance of a good knowl-
edge of geography, economics, and
history.

“Teamwork is ,more important

than leadership,”- he said, and
added that the ability to get along
with people is necessary. A shy
person, however, can become a
good Foreign Service officer. As
an example, Mr. Achilles said that
the late John G. Wiiiant was “the
shyest person I have ever known.”

Mr. Achilles, who joined the
Service in 1931 after spending
two years in newspaper work, ex-
plained that the department is
sending men to the major univer-
sities to interest students in For-
eign Service careers.

Eddie Beachler, C37, points this

Beachler, editor of this local

Doug Mills, director of athletics
at the University of lllinois, com-

Rickards Says
He Will Stay
With Panthers

By Max Scherb

Paul Rickards, The Wheeling
Whip and star ﬂinger on last
year’s ,“nightmare backﬁeld,” an-
nounced Friday that he deﬁnitely
would play at least another year
at Pitt. The deadly passer has
been tempted
by professional
cash.

A 1 though
Rickards didn't
win a letter
here last sea-
son, his passing
talents were
well enough
thought of by
the Los Ang-
 ~~~~ -- eles Rams and
Rickards the Cleveland
Brownies to warrant feelers.
Rickards is passing up the lucre
for an education.

Rickards didn’t disclose the
amount offered him by the two
clubs, but_ it is estimated that the
sum would be in the neighbor-
hood of $4000 per season. He
could raise this ante considera-
bly by a successful season here
in ’48.

It should be remembered that
Paul had a phenomenal year in
his freshman term here in 1944
when he led the nation’s passers
by completing 84 passes in 178
attempts - for a happy total of
997 yards. All this behind a just
so-so team. S

Panther Strategy
Frustrates WVU  

By John Golightly _

MORGANTOWN, W. VA.—VVest Virginia ’s raucous fans
must wait still another year. Saturday their Mountaineers beat '
' Pitt, 52-36, but the victory was far from complete. Prior to the
game the entire state echoed the cry of Morgan'town,news-
papers and urged their team to “pour it on.”

Although the Mountaineers were unable to roll up the‘
score, in a true provincial manner 7000 fans, who packed the
Fieldhouse, poured on volley after volley of boos despite a
pre-game appeal from VVest Virginia’s coach, Lee Patton.

Ace Sprnter
May Be Lost

Track coach, Carl Olson is fac-
ed with the loss of ace sprinter
Tommy Carr for the coming out-
door campaign. A recurrence of
a pulled thigh muscle may termi-
nate the running career of the
former Mt.'Lebanon and Shady-
side Academy star.

Meanwhile, Olson points out
that candidates without high
scho__ol or prep school track ex-
perience have turned out as ex-
cellent collegiate performers.

As examples, the veteran track
mentor cites Alex Zamborski of
Rankin, who became’ cross-coun-
try captain and ran the mile and
two-mile, and Alex Leggin, a half-
miler and miler.

Track practice, on the Stadium
cinder track has been hampered
by the failure to remove the band-
stand used last fall for the foot-
ball games.

° Patton had asked the assembly

“to refrain from unsportsmanlike
conduc-t when our opponents are
shooting fouls.” His appeal could
not compete Vwith the fear of the
audience.

Fans Angry and Embarrassed

Not only were their beloved
Mountaineers failing to pour it on,
they were unable to secure pos-
session. This embarrassing state
of affairs continued for 25 minutes

and the Panthers only a bucket

behind at 25-23.

In the nextiﬁve minutes, how-
ever, West _Virginia’s big men,
Leland Byrd and Eddie Beach,
iced the game for the Mountain-
eers with accurate hook and push

.shots from up close.

‘The 35-26 advantage silenced

the booers and restored an atmo- N

sphere of jubilation to the Field-
house.
Carlson’s Strategy Works

Up to then it had been a tight
ball game. Doc Carlson’s strategy
kept West Virginia unbalanced
throughout the ﬁrst half. As us-
ual the Mountaineers set up a

-loose man—for-man and refused

to check the Panthers in the back
courts. ’

Pitt merely held the ball un-
till a West Virginian pulled up
anchor and came out to guard.
After 13 minutes of stop-and-go-

‘tactics, the count was tied, 717.

Finally the Mountaineers began
to harrass Pitt. They pulled ahead
to 19-11 with ‘four minutes re-
maining and hung on to a 21-18.
halftime lead.

Tall Men Win Game

When they did get ‘the ball, the
Pattonmen knew what to do- In‘
the ﬁrst half they neglected their
tall men near the hoop but were
deadly’ from the outside-—partic-
ularly from the middle and left
side of the court.

After . the intermission the
Mountaineers fed to Beach, Byrd,
and Sichaus. up under and they
tallied 23 of the 31 markers re-
corded during the second stanza.

Dodo Canterna, who scored 11’-

points the ﬁrst half, was limited
to one ﬁeld goal and a free throw
during the afterpiece but led all
scorers with 14 points. West Vir-
ginia’s great all-around forward
Leland Byrd was c-lose behind
with 13,. A
COURT NOTES

Referee Al Walsh had anem-
barrassing evening. Several times,
both Doc Carlson and Umpire
John Kostecki had to remind
Walsh that he waspatrolling the
wrong end of the court.

Midway through the second half
Doc Carlson put on a gas mask
and stood on the sidelines there-
by rendering his opinion -of Mr.
Walsh.

try coach Carl Olson has been

In that comedy of errors known as the Pitt football mud-

the more sensational aspects.

dle, some of the more important but less spectacular features
of the committees’ reports have been overlooked in favor of

Both reports went at great lengths on the surface 
criticize the athletic administration for its relationship with
high. schools. Neither committee made much of any eﬁort to

really get at the facts.

There are _two downtown sports
reporters with almost ﬁfty years
of scholastic experience between
them. No one took the trouble to
talk to them. No member of eith-
er committee made a strong effort
to talk with high school’ coaches,
themselves.

Coaches Inﬂuence Youngsters

High school coaches are import-
ant factors in helping inﬂuence an
athletic youngster in his choice of
a college. Most of them are decent
and do their best to help their
boys make a wise choice of insti-
tutions. ’

However, some coaches make a
practice of receiving money in
return for sending_a boy to a pre-
determined school. Certain col-
leges make a practice of this and
as ’a result have built elaborate
farm systems.

This practice is beneath Pitt.
This type of coach is to be avoid-
ed in favor of the majoritywho
want to do the decent thing. For
them‘. a adequate program must
be built to win their conﬁdence
here. .

No Glamor At Pitt

attractive package, to offer a boy,

legiate life” hasn’t the appeal of,

All Pitt can offer is an educa-

tunately, this is not enough for a
boy who has an opportunity to go
‘elsewhere. Add to this the poor
housingfor athletes and it is easy
to see the athletic department’s
dilemma. - I

If Pitt .had a winning team,
some of the -glory might cover
the shabby» surface here. How-
ever, after 10 years, the outlook
and reputation are both very dull.
All of these factors need and de-
serve immediate improvement.

. Milligan Better Ambassador

Mr. Hagan and Mr. Milligan
have made conscientious efforts
to win the confidence of the prep
coaches. Milligan has never re-
fused an invitation to speak. In
his own way Milligan has been a
better ambassador for the school
than any of his predecessors:

The recent unpleasantness and
its resultant publicity has certain-
’ ly been a detriment to any ground-
work that the athletic department
Has laid. No ‘boy wants a school
where the athletic policy is a
farce.

If there is a sincere desire on
\the University’s part to better the
- athletic situation, then it must
come, from the top. Only by of-
fering athletes decent housing and

Aids   Shotmaking

By Bob Van Atta ,

Overshadowed by his ﬁne all-around play during the ﬂoor cam-
paign concluded Saturday ‘night was a story of individual deter-
mination on the part of Sammy David. The Bridgeville junior has
just. completed his third year as a varsity regular.

Sammy consistently stayed with the tri-state collegiate scor-
ing leaders throughout the sea-¢
son, accounting for many of his

points through a vast improve-
ment in four shooting.

“Last year,” David related, “my
foul shooting was poor. I made
only 51 out of 104 attempts.

Foul Shooting Improves

“So I resolved that I would
practice on that weakness. I seem
to have done a little better this .
year, too.”

Sammy speaks mildly when he
says “a little better.” His mark
last season was 49 percent, and
this year he connected on 99 out
of 137 for 73 percent, an im-
provement of 50 per cent over the
preceding campaign.

"offensive improvement precludes a
possible attack next year Char-
ey Hyatt’s season recor of 314
points, established by the fabulous
All-American in 1930.

ermnenl. trends in Pennsylvania
and the nation are moving away
from centralization. with more
emphasis being placed on county
and municipal control. according
to William S. Livingoocl Jr., secre-
tary of internal affairs of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The move away from bureau-
cracy and concent ration of author-
ity is a healthy one, he empha-
sized. It means evonomy, rather
than ineliiciency, he said, since it
puts governmentzil spending closer
to the voter.

Like a nation half slave and hail‘
tree. he said, “we cannot exist half
a republic and half a socialistic
"bureaucracy.

“The governor oi? Pennsylvania
has more power than any one man
can efTfe’ctiVely administer.” he
stated in citing the Philadelphia
Bar Association plan for the ap-
pointment of judges, and the State
Utilities COn1lT1lSSl0I1’S powers, as
examples of the "misuse of cen-‘
tralized authority.

“The four :1’reedoms," according
to Mr. Livingood, “are not the
greatest :treedo1ns. The greatest
freedom in the world is political
freedom. Every other freedom to
which mankind is l'.1e:i_r depends
upon. it."

For the first time since 1938,
the entire chemistry departinent~—
classrooms, laboratories, teachers’
oflices, and the Science-Tec.hno_lo-
gy library——~is housed in Alumni
Hall. The building, presented to
the ‘University in 1921 by 2,600
alumni, is in the process of being

remodeled.
