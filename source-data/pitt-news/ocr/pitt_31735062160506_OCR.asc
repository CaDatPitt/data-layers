for U.S. Health Crisis

BY CATHY TUTTLE

“If you can’t afford to live,‘ you
die,'.' claimed the NBC ﬁlm ‘What
Price Health,’ during a‘ program on
health care in America, Tuesday.

“Health care is a system _that’s
organized,‘ that’s_ geare_d for pro-
fit,” said John Bradley, economist
and activist in_ the Medical
Community for Human Rights.

.“The main problems of American '

health care are financing, availa-
bility and quality. It's important
that people be educated about their
health. but just as important is
cutting down on the super-exces-
sive" cost of being} ‘sick and
,insurance." I
The insurance industry is bigger
than the national defense Bradley
maintains. Of the $83 billion spent
,annually on healthcare. he says
‘about. $50 billion of it’ passes
‘,through the hands of insurance
companies. Bradley cited five" of

what he calls ‘indictments’ against-

insurance agencies. v
1: The organization and very
existence of insurance companies
are wasteful. There are over 1800
1 companies, all poorly managed,

and all spending vast amounts of ,

money in competitive advertising.”

2: “Most insurance ‘companies
don't say what they're going to‘
do.". Because most insurance
policies are ambiguous, claims
"Bradley, ’a~ few policy holders
realize their insurance most likely
does not'cover optical care, dental
care. and maternity care A for
unmarried women.

3: Insurance distorts the medical
practice. Because most policies
cover‘only care received in the
hospital. “people who don't need

BY KARL BALDYS

An “aborted campaign rally
Wednesday was the spark ' of
confrontation, between: Paul ‘Le-.
Blanc, Socialist Party candidate for
mayor. and administrators in the
Office of- Student Activities. Al-
though that campaign rally by
Socialist Alliance was cancelled,
Dan Meloro has approved plans for

L a free speech rally on Monday. .

According to Meloro,‘the Wed-
nesdayrally. scheduled on .the
Cathedral lawn, was in- violation of
a federal law prohibiting‘ the
political involvement of/state
related universities. “An outdoor
campaign rally could be con-

I strued as University support for a '

political candidate. University
regulations strictly prohibit that. in
compliance with the federal law‘."

BY MARC RUDOLPH —

A class action suit against the»

U.S. government has been filed, by
the Political Rights’Defense Fund
(PRDF) on behalf of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and
Young Socialist Allian‘ce.(YSA).
The suit charges" that the U.S.
‘government, since 1948 has en-
gaged in “a systematic campaign,

‘of excessive interrogations, em-

ployment discrimination and other
harrassment against the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP)...and to -spy
upon them systematically by means
of warrantless electronic surveil-
lance, unauthorized opening and
monitoring of mail, burglary and
other illegal means." ‘

The suit further charges Nixon,. 

Haldeman, Mitchell and Deanwith
expanding and intensifying this
harrassment since late _l‘_)70. It

The U.pN.= A Rusting Tool?

BY LARRY PLATT

The United Nations’ effectiveness
as a peace keeping agency was the
subject discussed at the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs. (GSPIA) forum. “The
A Rusting Tool?"

Dr. Daniel Cheever. a GSPIA
professor and a former member of
of the U.N.
Conference on International Or-
ganizations. denied the U.N. is a
rusting tool, Instead he termed the
organization “shiny. used and still I
relatively good."

“The difficulty,” explained Chee-

ve'r, “is that the U.S. does not like
the shop in which the tool is used.”

He referred to the diplomatic
isolation of Israel through the U.N .,
which came as a result of the
“solidarity of the African delega-
tion.” Y

He continued saying the “United
States is disenchanted with the
realities of world politics." The
United Nations no longer “plays
into the hands ofthe U.S." as it did
during the Korean conflict.

Cheever suggested it nowvtends to
playcinto the hands of the third
world. This has been perceived

faster by the“U.S.S.R. and China
‘than by the United States, ‘Dr.
Cheever says. 5' ‘’

Viewing foreign policy from a
domestic level, Cheever claimed
our legislative bodies are not
ﬂexible enough to deal with world
crises.

 ‘‘If one were to look at the scope
concerns "of ,

of ,_the functional
government,” he said, “one would
ﬁnd that the scope of political
authority is inadequate. Despite its
structural deﬁciencies, the United
Nations provides a way of reaching

“I was open with my parole
officer,” Yow said. “I explained
the activity I carried on and
emphasized that it was completely
legal. It was all right with him.”

“Then the FBI began harras_sing

_ me through my parole officer. The-

parole officer threatened me with
reincarceration,” he explained.,
Yow was forced to give up his
political activities until March,
1973, when he was released from
parole. This was also around the
time‘ of the bombing of the SWP

office in Houston.

“The police, if they weren't
actually supporting such activity,
winked at such activity,” says Yow.

bombed themselves for publicity.”

Dr. Alvin Roseman, Assistant

discussed economic and social
developmental branches of the
United Nations. He said their work
has been “one of the plus facors"
for the U.N.

“The days -of tutelage are

“more and more countries are able

United States are no longer being

- “The onus has shifted out of the

there is now a “centralization of

Dr. Robert Walters, political

He noted such problems are of
integral importance to the relations
between advanced industrial soci-
eties and under-developed ones.

Walters sees “the technical
non-political aspects of the U.N.

*problems.” He listed multi-

economic problems relating to

Walters predicts regional interna-

A S.G. Board Meeting  
Money, Money, Money

BY DREW PORVAZNIK
The University Book Store suf-
fered a $40,000 loss during the past
year, according to Mike Furick, a
Student Government Board (SGB)

members.
At Tuesday’s SGB meeting,
‘Furick reported that the loss

resulted from covering the cost of
new machines purchased by the
bookstore. He said otherwise the
bookstore would have had a
$20,000 gain if the‘ machines were
not bought during the past year.

Furick added that bookstores at
Carnegie-Mellon University and
Carlow College reported losses and

‘ are considering closing down. In
that event, both schools may ask
the University of Pittsburgh Book
Center to ' act_ as their book
suppliers Furick said.

In other business SGB member,
Janet Toth "said SG will have an
additional $4,000 to cover emer-
gency allocation requsts. The extra
money was taken out of the
Franklin Pangborn Film Club
student accounts. V

William Lenaghen, Assistant Di-
rector of Student Activities, said a
portion of the $4,000 will be used to
finance allocation requests by the

Pitt Hockey Club, the Pitt Bowling
Club and. the American Pharma-
ceutical Association.

Marvin Morris,‘ president of the
Franklin Pangbom Film Club said
“The removing of the $4,000 from
our account is no big loss since we
already have sufficient funds in the
particular account to cover in the
event of losses from the Saturday
and Thursday night box office
returns.” .

The Committee also recomended
a $810 modification to be granted to
the Pitt Hockey Club in order to pay
for six weeks of practice by the club
in November. The Board passed
the recommendation./

After resolving constitutional con-
flicts with the Committee on
Student Orgnizations [CSO], the
Bahai Club was granted University
recognition by the Board. The
conflicts centered on questions of
undergraduate membership and
qualifications for running for office.

The Third World People's Coali-
tion was rejected University recog"-‘
nition by CS0 on the grounds that
their activities overlapped those of
the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and the Young
Socialist Alliance

ideas were thoroughly and convin-
-cingly attacked. A worker from
Western Psych talked about how
racist ideas like Jensenism are
used by employers to divide black
and white workers. Others,
including a member of the Black
Studies faculty and an Arab
student called for the genetic
inferiority theories to be banned
from all campuses. _ There was

. lively discussion and debate with .

the majority agreeing with the
P.L.P. position --which will soon be
outlined. _ _
Is this the. impression we get
from the Pitt News article? Hardly.
All we have is two photographs of
Perloff and Schulman and some
quotes taken exclusively from these
two professors. -What an insult to

the vast majority of people at the

event who are becoming involved
in a movement to fight the ideology
and practice of racism on the Pitt
c'ampus!! It is one thing to omit a
few details in an article. It is
another thing to" omit the entire
nature ‘and thrust of the event.
We will now try to summarizea
few ofrthe points we made at the
discussion. ‘ We feel that» the

The majority ’of the citizens are

also unfamiliar withthe documents ’

‘‘You’d better watch what kind of

excuse for people not being able to

- The Electoral College, which
takes some of the direct vote of
presidential election away from the
people, has been widely-criticized,
because it is not democratic. The
people who are for the abolition of
this representative body scream,
“The Electoral College is antiqua-
ted and we are educated well
enough to directly pick our
president!" How ‘can these people

.be trusted with. such a crucial,

decision, if they are so ignorant of
the mechanics of our government.

The ‘crimes of Watergate have
been jcommited and cannot be
erased, but they should teach a
lesson to the American people. and
give them more initiative to
become not just spectators in the
political arena, but active partici-

pants.

Let's prove to ourselves and" the
rest of the world that we are
responsible enought to handle the
well balanced democracy that we
received from our Founding Fa-
thers. We have done a bad job so
far, but there is still time. Le't’s

completely wrong, yet this was not
mentioned once in the Pitt News
article. In addition the point was
raised that the genetic theories of
racial inferiority are being spread
in such widely read magazines as
Time, Newsweek, Atlantic and
Fortune in order to divide black and
white workers and students.

If black and whites are busy
ﬁghting each other or if they see
each other as “inferior,” than the
system gets taken off the hook.
Jensenism is a modern form of
social darwinism which was a
biological justification for the
status-quo. This point wasn't
mentioned once in the article
although it was repeatedly raised.

We have already seen the results
of racist ideology in Nazi Germany.

Over 80 million people died as a -

result of Hitler’s campaigns. Only

. 6 million. were the Jews who were a

speciﬁc target of the Nazi regime.
This shows that racism affects not,
only the minority groups, but every
worker and student-black or white.
the quality of our lives is dependent

- on our ability to unite with others to

fight for aqdecent society.A Those
who are ‘taken. in by the current
wave of racist ideology are only
hurting themselves. Perhaps these
people should keep in mind the
scene of thousands of Nazi soldiers

smilingly goose-stepping to‘ their_

deaths. '
Finally,-if a Pitt professor in the
Medical School was recommending
that his students give a certain
drug .to their future-patients, a
drug which he knew to be a poison,

the professor would quickly be,

fired at the very least. We feel that
the teaching of Jensenism is in the
same language.‘ Racism is a
poison--a deadly poison which has
resulted in millions of deaths
When we
consider, in addition, the.conclu'-
sive evidence shattering all of the
Jensen’s major and minor points,

how can we allow the teaching of ‘
_such dangerous, unscientific gar- ~

bage on any campus?

ehtal Care Offered ‘He usedo Shotgun

BY LARRY PANSINO

Reduced costs for complete
dental care are available for all Pitt
students at the Salk Hall clinic.
Appointments are scheduled when
the clinic’s dental students can
provide the care necessary for each
particular case.

The clinic‘, part of the Dental
School program, offers its services
at one-third to one-half the amount
a private dentist charges, ac-
cording to Dr. Thomas G. Barker,
Assistant Dean and Director of
Clinics. _

“Because we are a non-profit
institution.” said Barker, “we are
not allowed to make money. We
have a minimumfee, but it doesn’t
even pay for the costs of the clinic.
The clinic, of course, is supported
by the state."

The dental work is done by
second and third-year students

1 whose work is supervised --by the

instructing dentists. Patients are
accepted when theircases offer the
student-dentists jobs they can
handle and also learn from as a part
of their training.

Occasionally patients must wait
several months before their work is

actually begun. The length of time‘
depends on the patients’ needs and‘

when these needs can be fit into the
training procedures of the dental
students, Barker said.

“Once a patient is taken in,"
said Dr. Barker, “we are very

We do a general medical and

Then a diagnosis is done and the"

patient is referred to the depart-

work he needs. .

BY M. C. PILECKI

In that time-honored genre of
police ‘yarns. the cops were always
the good guys. and crime never
paid. Lately. especially in the wake
of highly publicized incidents. of
police brutality. this has changed.
Cops have been villains. or comic
bunglers at best. And the few
“hero"' cops have either been
sadistic Clint Eastwood types or the
unbelievable supermen of old. But
they were never really human.

Let’s face it. Cops are people.
They’re underpaid, under-respect-
ed and are doing a necessary job
that no one wants to do. If a few go
“bad,” it’s surprising only in that
more don’t. Until now, no ﬂick has
really captured, and" humanized,

Robbers has done just that.

police but also organized crime. in a
beautifully anarchic statement of
t_he role of cops. It starts out when
one patrolman (Joseph Bologna)
confesses to his detective-buddy
(Cliff Gorman) that he robbed a
liquor store while on duty one
night.

The two immediately begin plans

for a mythical “job" to relieve their .

financial situations. But being
good. honest cops. they put it out of
their minds. Their situations don't

not?” -

However he was satisfied with the
compromise. “The rally on
Monday will involve all the political
groups on campus." Le Blanc said.

“We have already invited the
Black Action Society (BAS) and are
in the process of contacting the
College Young Democrats and the
Young Republicans",

Meloro indicated that a review of
the Young Socialist Alliance by the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions was being considered because
the group blatently violated stu-
dent regulations. “They didn't ask
for another location but on the day
of the event simply announced the
rally. It is not free ‘speech we are
trying to stifle. Any group has the
-right to bring in speakers, with any
opinions, but the procedures for
the reservation of space must be
followed.” 7’

Meloro said that the free speech

was not in support of any one
political candidate. “The YSA is

organizing a rally to encourage free

speech. , That's fine. We’refnot

‘Although Le Blanc was-pleased
that the situation was clarified and

expressed reservations. “The best

Besides the fact that the Pitt‘Panthers will record their first home

- victory of the 1973 season, there will be some spectacular doings at Pitt

"Stadium tomorrow to thrill the homecoming crowd. ,
- The man of the day is going to be Tony “T.D."’ Dorsett and a few Pitt

1 records are very likely to fall to the phenominal freshman. And it's

only going to be the start ‘of things to come in the next three years.
To date. Dorsett has romped for 823 yards in the 155 attempts. He

. needs only 1,42'more yards to break the all-time Pitt yards rushing in a

single season mark, set back in 1929. He already holds the single game
rushing mark, breaking the old one when he sloshed for 265 yards
against "Northwestern. ' ' ' . .
Dorsett has scored eight touchdowns in six games and is closing
rapidly on the Pitt record ‘of 13 in one season held by George McLaren,
in 1917. With a big day against the Middies, T.D. will be well on his
way to set a new Pitt record for yards rushing in a career. The present
record is held by Marshall Goldberg; 1,957 yards from 1936-38.

It's obvious that Dorsett is the mainstray of the Pitt offense, on the *

ground that is, and without him the Panthers" are a team without legs.

I ,But there will be no way to stop Dorsett tomorrow, short of injury.

The ‘Navy defense has nothing to do it with. They have no
lightning-quick linebackers to stop the outside run and they have no

_ Gary'Burleys to protect up the middle. They have no Rod Kirbys,

Glenn Hydes or Mike Bulinos.

Besides Dorsett, Navyiwill have to contend with quarterback Bill -

Daniels, who always seems to surprise his opponents with his uncanny
knack at running the option, particularly running." Look for Daniels
to come off with another solid performance. _

Navy lost to Boston College 44-7, and carries a 3-3 record into
t'omorrow’s game. Their attack will feature running back Cleveland
Cooper, but, speaking over the phone hookup at Tuesday's luncheon,
Navy coach George Welsh put it in so many words that he doesn't

posses the talent that can lead a ballclub.

No, the Midshipmen don't ‘come with many names that carry much
prominence onto the gridiron but what they do have going for them is
the determination of the Naval Academy. Think about it. The Middies
were blown off by Penn Statebut in turn blew off Air Force, who
battled the Nittany Lions to a 19-9 score.

Navy will be coming at Pit after two straight victories. In both games
they ‘completely dominated their opponents. Last year, Navy handed
Pitt and embarrassing defeat and the Cats should have that in mind.

Daniels played most of the second i_

half for Pitt in last season’s contest,
and completed six of seven passes

Welsh has to be wondering about
his squad. After being overrun by
Penn State and Boston\CoIIege, his

But Piso kept coming. Twice in
the half they came close to scoring.

A sure shot was blocked by.

defenseman Clin and another was
broken up by goalie Downing
diving to his right and punching the
ball away.

With thirty seconds inythe half,
the psyched Quitters were again on
the move. But Piso’s Avila blocked
a final shot and the half ended 1-0.

The second half was mostly
defense with both~teams showing
distinctive playing styles: Piso, a
ball control team using ﬁnesse and
the Quitters very phsyical and
hard—charging. The game wound
down until, with four minutes to
go, the Quitter were awarded a side
pass close to Piso’s goal. Hull
lobbed an overhead pass to Cecconi
who pushed it past the goalie for
the score. _

The remainder of the game Piso
was forced to play the type of game
they weren't accustomed to:

- catch-up ball. More than once they

forced long outside shots to try and

score. The Quitters remained cool, .
protecting their lead.

BY VINCE [THE WOP] DI NARDO

The people at the University of Pittsburgh are 'blowing smoke’ with
all that talk about a Major Change In Pitt Football. The Panthers have
been very lucky in accumulating a 3-2-1 record to date, and as will be

evidenced tomorrow, Navy will bomb the Panthers right out of Pitt

Stadium.

First off the Panthers layed a Geor ia team that couldn't even beat
Vanderbilt last week. hen a merci 111 Grant Teaff--the Baylor head
coac_h--kept the score down because Johnny Majors is a personal friend

“At Northwestern, Johnny Pont’s Wildcats were hindered by the rain
and couldn't keep their footing. As a result an average runner named
Tony Dorsett was able to gain 265 yards on the ground.

Tulane showed no sympathy and trounced Pitt 24-6 and at West
Virginia Danny Bugs had the flu. Boston College halfback Tony
Esposito played with two broken legs last week but still managed to
pick up 58' yards.

Navy head man George Welsh knows that Pitt is weak and as a result
has taken to the press to warn his team‘ about suffering a letdown.

To make sure his Middies don’t take Pitt too lightly, Welsh was '

quoted on Wednesday as saying that “Pitt can play with Penn State

Welsh is sincere and isn’t blowing any smoke! I like Navy by 30.

‘who was the National Football League’s Rookie of-the year last year,

asked Cope what the score was. -

“F ifteen-Love,” , Cope answered.

Harris, who undoubtedly knows more about football than he does
about tennis seemed dazed and answered: “Thank you, dear.”

There is a hot rumor out of Washington thatpthe President of the
United States will resign his position to take a job as an assistant
football coach with either the Miami Dolphins of the NFL or the Texas

a Longhorns.

The President, who is reportedly looking for a way out of the
Watergate mess, has had limited football experience at Whittier
College in California.
calling the unexpected play. The record will show that he was a master
at running the quarterback sneak. . '

You might also recall, the President was the one who named Texas as
the No. 1 team in the country in 1969. A State College resident,’ who
refused to be identified, speculated yesterday that the Washington
major domo was thinking ahead of time then, and made a deal ‘with
Texas’ Darrel Royal." ,

I am givingl2-8 odds that the President takes_the Miami job, and is
groomed for the head job after Don Shula’s retirement. The President
has shown a great desire to be the man calling the shots. .

station is trying to combat Group W's Lee Arthur and NBC’s Jane
Chastain. 7 '

I am giving 5-2 odds that within a week, Lovelace will be on the air
with a daily five minute sports program. The only difficulty has arisen
in coming up with a title for the show. Lovelace wants to call her
special" “Deep Threat," but some station Big Wigs think it might
sound too much like her last ﬁasco.
