Murchers fake Isak Ihe night

By Allison Stallone
Staff Writer C

An emotional night filled
with stories of rape and domes-
tic violence filled the William
Pitt Union after the “Take Back
The Night” march from
Carnegie Mellon University to
Pitt protesting sexual and
domestic violence against men
and women.

“We hope it starts a growing
awareness and understanding
of the effects of sexual

assault,” said Stephanie
Sudzina, co-president of the
Campus Women’s
Organization.

CWO co-sponsored the
march along with organizations
from CMU, Chatham College,
Pitt and National Organization
of Women. Students from
Chatham College, CMU,
Carlow College and Pitt attend-
ed the march.

“I think it’s very important to

commemorate, respect and owe
time to those who have-suf-
fered from this devastation,”
said Kim Graziani, Pitt student.

The march started with
music and speakers at Warner
Hall at CMU. The speakers
talked about how important
this event was.

“We need to break the
silence that is propagating the
violence,” said Julie Crowell,

Frohnmayer leads
discussion on Internet

By Jackie Duggan
Staff Writer

The First Amendment and
how it applies to the Internet
was the focus of the panel dis-
cussion in the Lower Lounge
of the William Pitt Union yes-
terday. p

John Frohnmayer, the for-
mer chairman for the National"
Endowment for the Arts,
directed the panel.

, Frohnmayer is best known for

his defense in the Robert
Mapplethorpe art exhibit inci-
dent. One of Mapplethorpe’s
exhibitions was prohibited
from being displayed because
of questionable content of his
pictures. A

Frohnmayer kept the discus-
sion ﬂowing by raising issues
that questioned the role _of the
government in the age of
advancing technology.

“I was very pleased with the
panel today,” said
Frohnmayer. “Of course, we
were only able to touch on
some of the complex issues.”

Frohnmayer opened the dis-
cussion by asking the panel’s

opinions on the
Communications Decency

Act, whichjrecently passed the ,
Senate Commerce Committee.

“This mindless piece of leg-
islation passed’ without hear-
ings on Feb. l,” said
Frohnmayer.

The Decency Act was pro-
posed by Senator James Exon
(D—Neb) and would essential-
ly make it illegal to knowing-
ly put obscenity on the
Internet. The measure would
levy fines as high as $100,000
and jail terms of up to two
years.

“[Exon] is putting heavy
criminal penalties on some-
thing he clearly doesn’t know
anything about,” said
Frohnmayer.

Frohnmayer said this cre-
ates two dangers. First, it
would kill the Internet before
it even takes off, and second,
it puts a law on the books that
no one will obey.

“It’s like prohibition,” he
said.

Frohnmayer said Exon’s bill
is an attempt to protect chil-

BOSTON — Incoming
freshmen are quickly drawn
into binge drinking on col-
lege campuses because alco-
hol is easy to get, said a
Harvard School of Public
Health study released yester-
day.

The study, which polled
720 freshmen anonymously
at 13 U.S. colleges with a
high degree of binge drink-
ing, showed that 84 percent
of freshmen saw heavy alco-
hol use as a problem on cam-

Harvard defines binge
drinking as men having a
minimum of five drinks in a

Another issue discussed was
the how the government
would police the senders of
obscene messages.

At Pitt, access to the Net is
considered a privilege, and the
Computer and Information
Service has its own system of
protecting students.

“The first time an incident
is reported we give a warning
to the individual sending
obscene messages.

“If someone reports an inci-
dent of harassment we bring it
to the attention of the individ-
ual sending the messages,”
said Paul Stieman, Director of
CIS. “If they continue, they
are taken to the judicial board,
and the individual could lose
their access privileges or be
expelled.”

The pubic library is another
place where people can gain
access to the Net. Dan
Iddings, the Assistant Director
of the Carnegie Library, said
despite what the Decency Act
suggests, the Carnegie does
not deny access to the Net

experience with rape. She is a
an individual who has dedicat-
ed herself to speaking out

1 against sexual violence at high

schools, universities and other
“Take Back The Night”
marches, according to
Sudzina. “Katie” not only
spoke about her own experi-

ence with rape, but also the‘

personal violence stories she
has heard from people that she
speaks to around the country.

After the speakers there was .,

an open mic for anyone who
wanted to stand up and tell
their story of violence. ' ‘

“We encourage people to tell
their personal stories with vio-
lence,” said Dolin.

Two people stood up and-

told their story to a crowd of
approximately 150 people.
Then the march began
through the CMU fraternity
complex, where the chanting

started and the “people unite, i

take back the night” signs
went up.

“One—two-three-four, we
won’t take this anymore, five-
six-seven-eight, stop the vio-
lence,’ stop the hate.”

They continued down Fifth
Avenue, around Oakland’s
bars and into the Union assem-
bly room, where there were
clotheslines that filled the
room with T-shirts in order to
remember women or families
and friends of women who

said, “It is absurd that in prac-
tice a 12-year-old has more
access to pornography than a
17-year-old Pitt student.”

Discussion also involved
the issue of the intent of the
sender.

“Intent should not matter,
even if it is sexually explicit,”
said Shannon Smithey,
Department of Political
Science. “As long as it is not
criminal in nature, such as
harassment, intent of the
sender should not be consid-
ered.”

The panel - and
Frohnmayer’s visit was co-
sponsored by the University
Honors College, School of
Law, School of Library and
Information Science and the
Office of Student Activities."

Frohnmayer also participat-
ed in a student discussion on
free speech and gave an infor-
mative speech on the First
Amendment and the informa-
tion superhighway throughout
the week.

“We were delighted that
John [Frohnmayer], who is so
knowledgeable on these
issues, was willing to share

his experiences with‘ stu-‘

Coming to America...

(Tony F iorini is a Pitt junior who was on
Semester at Sea last term. )

PITTSBURGH — It’s 5 a.m. In-the dis-
tance, beyond the bow of the S.S.
Universe, is the reddish orange glow of
street lights at dawn, my first sight of the
USA. We are docking this morning for
the last time.

As I sailed across the Atlantic, every-
thing seemed to be in slow motion. After

2 four days of classes, it was time for

ﬁnals. Say what you want, but there is no
better place to study than on top of a ship
in the middle of the ocean. Take my ,
word for it. It seemed as though I had so
much time, but I was down to my last
three days. With classes over, conversa-
tions turned from, “How did your class
go?” to, “What are you doing when you
get home  and when can I visit?”

Three enormous blue duffel bags lay ~
empty on the ﬂoor waiting for me to stuff
all of my belongings in them. One bag
for clothes, one for gifts, and one for all
the stuff that didn’t fit in the other two. It
was the official packing day, and every-
thing that you were not going to carry off
the ship in one trip had to be packed and
taken up to promenade deck. From there,
the bags waited until a crane would lift
them off in Florida the next day. This
took the better part of a day, being inter-
rupted by friends wanting me to write a
few last words in their journals.

It was now Dec. 22, but felt nothing
like Christmas time to me. I was outside,
wearing shorts, getting myself ready for
the shocks that would surely follow in
the next few days. In the long promenade
hall of the Universe, some students were

. making signs to hang on the ship the next

day to greet their families. I spent my last

,:day walkingaround. the ship, my home __
for the past 100 days. I went up to the

observation deck to stare out into the
ocean again. I knew that was something I
would want to remember.

It was some time before I moved on. I
walked around the rest of the ship effort-
lessly, moving in sync with each roll of
the vessel. Just when I knew all the short
cuts of getting around the ship, it was
time to leave. Tomorrow is the big day,
back in the states. -

  

December 23, a day that will live in
my memory forever. There was a manda-
tory wake up call at 6:45 a.m., but by
then I had been up for an hour. I was
among a handful of people up to see the
ﬁrst lights of Florida, It was then, as I
shed the first of many tears, that I real-
ized what a sad day this was going to be.
Maritime custom dictates that aship ﬂy
the ﬂag of the country it is docked in, and
we were going home. At 7:30 a.m., the
U.S. ﬂag was raised among a crowd of
people on the deck. Looking around‘,,I
could see some people hugging, some

standingalone, some laughing and some
crying. Old Glory was ﬂying high, and in
30 minutes, we would be docked.

The banners some people had made
were hung on any open space on the port
side, everything from, ‘Thanks for the
world mom and dad” to “Honey, I’m
home.” People, three and four deep were

_ lined along the rails to catch a glimpse of

the families-waiting‘ to greet the ship. As
students spotted their parents, and loved
ones, people began to yell back and
forth. Then a voice I wasn’t expecting to
hear, Bruce Springsteen singing “Born in
the USA.” Then Neil Diamond came on
with “Coming to America.” As other
peoples’ eyes began to water and tears
rolled down their cheeks, I‘couldn’t help
but join in. You could almost reach out
and touch the people waiting. Soon, they
would be in each other’s arms As in

 

ait togreet the s.s. Uniee A

Vancouver, I could only watch as fami-
lies became re-acquainted, my family
was not able to meet the ship, but I knew
I would be home soon enough.

My group was the fifth group to get
off. Once you were off,.there was no
going back, it was over. The rush was

’ incredible. One minute I was talking to

friends, saying my good-byes, and then
over the PA came, “I would like to call
group ﬁve to Purser’s Square for disem-
barkation.” I ran downstairs to get my
backpack, and up to the gangway. After
getting hugged from a long line of peo-

The Pitt News, Thursday, April 6, 1995

ple, and mumbling “good-bye” between
the tears, I was walking off the ship for
the last time.

Before going into the warehouse to get
my bags, I looked back one last time.
Once inside, all the bags were laid out in
long lines, I found my three and with a
friend got a taxi to my hotel for the night.
We asked the taxi driver if he took US."
dollars, he just looked at us like we were
stupid and said yes. lnvthe cab he had the
radio on top-40. Being away from the
country for so long you can’t help but see
things differently when you get back.
Watching TV, using dollars and drinking
the tap water, things that were so every-

. day before I left were now novelties. A

meeting preparing everyone for the
shock of going home was held on the trip
across the Atlantic, and a person who had
been on a past voyage said, “You won’t
look at things thersame. You will see
things differently, you willnotice things
you never noticed before. Be prepared.”

I spent the night in Florida, and once
again got up at the “butt-crack” of dawn
to catch my ﬂight to Williamsport. I had
a three-hour lay-over in Pittsburgh, it felt
like three days. When I arrived in
Williamsport, I was the ﬁrst one in the
airport and was greeted by family and
friends. The next couple of days were
chaos, I can’t even remember how I
made it through Christmas. Everywhere I
went people asked how it was.

“How was your cruise?”

‘.‘Well, It wasn’t exactly a cruise, it was
incredible.”

What else could I say‘? It is so hard to
explain. If you haven’t experienced it, it
can’t be explained; If you have experi-
enced it you don’t need it explained.
Then they would say, “Where all did you
go again?” I take a" deep breath and the
countries slide off my tongue like one
long word. Then I would start telling sto-
ries, but for most people it was enough to
hear it went well. It is a bit disconcerting
to realize people really don’t want to hear
about something that was such a huge
part of your life.

In a little less than two weeks, I was
back at Pitt, trying to get my life back
together. As I walked to class the first
day I was looking for people from the
ship. I had seen the same 500 people

everyday for the past four months, and
had the knowledge that wherever I was, I
would see someone I knew. This feeling
of security was shattered by coming back
to this university. I suddenly found
myself utterly alone. Luckily there is a
large group of students from last fall that
gp to Pitt, and we get together often.

I think of my Semester at Sea .experi-
ence every day. It is a rare day that I
don’t comeacross something in the
newspaper or on TV that doesn’t have
anything to do with one of theeountries I
visited. When the Kobe Earthquake hit, I
saw the same streets I had walked on
months earlier now in ruins. I couldn’t
help but think that some of the people I
had talked to died in the quake.

Every time I see things that remind me
of the voyage (which is all the time) I
want to tell whoeverl am with how last
semesterl was on a ship going around
the world and all the experiences I had.
But I know I can’t. So I sit silently, if
someone would ask me about it, I would
gladly tell them, but I am reluctant to
offer it anymore.

This semester, being back at Pitt, is like
starting all over again. I thought I knew
what I wanted to do with my life, but
now I’m not so sure. This summer I am
going to do some traveling around the
U.S. and visit some friends from the ship.
The great thing about having friends all
over the country is you always have a
place to stay, the bad thing is you don’t
get to see them very often. Enough about
that, I am getting depressed.

If you, or anyone you know, is thinking
about going on Semester at Sea I would
say, scrape up the money and go. I would
leave tomorrow to go again. If you‘ need
someone to talk to about it, the Semester
at Sea office is on the eighth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union. Also, I would be
glad to talk more about my voyage, I can
be reached through The Pitt News, at
648-7980.. I can’t tell you everything I
learned, I can’t describe how beautiful
the sunsets were, but I can tell you what
it was like to ﬂoat in the Dead Sea
(among other things). Until the next
Voyage.

Question authority

On Tuesday, Professor Richard Tobias resigned from the
University Senate Council and the Faculty-Assembly because of
the ﬂap over Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s decision to drop
HealthAmerica from the University of Pittsburgh’s medical
insurance coverage.

This decision is an effective way to make a protest. It is not

something that can be easily ignored. The problem, however, '

comes from the fact that there may now be no one in the
University Senate Council to represent the same interests.

The Pitt News supports Professor Tobias in his decision.
When the situation becomes unresolvable, it is sometimes nec-
essary to make a protest by voting with your feet. This action
must not allow the voices of dissent to be silenced by their
absence. What Tobias did may have been counter-productive,
but people in Faculty Assembly and in the university as a whole
must question the administration.

The ability to speak out and ask the administration to address
the grievances of the faculty, staff and students is an important
option for the University of Pittsburgh community to have. The
remaining members of the Senate Council and Faculty
Assembly must continue to call the administration to task.

Over the past week, John Frohnmeyer, former head of the
National Endowment for the Arts under President Bush, has been

giving talks and leading discussions about various aspects of the

First Amendment to the Constitution.
Before going any further, here is what the First Amendment says:

“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of reli-

gion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the free-
dom of speech, or the press, or the right of the people peaceably
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of griev-
ances.”

Increasingly, the First Amendment is under attack by various
groups, ranging from the American Legion, who proudly proclaim
that they fought for freedom, to former editors of The Pitt News,
who developed politically correct language policies.

Yesterday, Frohnmeyer’s round of conferences wound up with a
discussion about the First Amendment and the Internet. This area, as
well as all other forums for the exchange of ideas, must be allowed
to police itself. As communication becomes more rapid and avail-

able, such measures as the Exon Bill, which seeks to impose stan-

dards of obscenity onto the Internet, must be opposed.

What right does anyone else have in determining others’ access to
information? The morality of one person does not necessarily hold
for all. The typical response to this is, what right do people have to
put out material others may deem offensive? The only answer is that
no one can know in advance what someone will deem offensive.
When that question is applied to information which is being released
in order to inform a population, when in doubt, the information, be it
text, film or photographs, should be released to allow people to
determine for themselves what they think about given information.

Cl-letsea,

Corporation ruins cultural icon

or those of you who
Fhaven’t heard, M&Ms

will be changing soon.
Because of a decision made by
some stuffed shirts up in
Corporate America, there will
be a new color invading bags
of M&Ms all across the world
and the tan M&Ms will be
removed. Out with the old and
in with the new.

For some reason, the people
at the M&M/Mars candy com-
pany decided that they needed
a change. Maybe sales were
down. Maybe someone just
really hated the color tan. But
most likely’ it was because of
that contagious feeling ram-
pantly spreading through cor-
porations that products need to
keep up with the times and
change in the name of technol-
ogy.

When is it going to end?
Americans should be fright-
ened to know that companies
continually feel the need to
“better” their products. It is
our duty to let them know that
we like the nostalgic familiari-
ty of certain products that have
evolved over time to become
household names. Who
doesn’t have happy memories
of sticky little hands dyed vari-
ous shades of orange, green
and brown from the M&Ms
you worked so hard to get by
being quiet in the grocery store
while Mommy did her shop-
ping?

I beg you, don’t force me in
my old age to tell stories to my
grandchildren about how
M&Ms were made of primary
colors when I was young
instead of the neon shades they
will probably be 50 years from
now. Unfortunately, I see this
as a reality of my senior years.

However, I feel compelled to
give a small bit of credit to the
decision-makers at
M&M/Mars. We, the con-
sumers, were given the oppor-
tunity to vote on a new color.
By calling l-800—FUN—
COLOR, consumers could
choose pink, purple, blue or no
new color. (I, of course, made
it a personal crusade to vote

for no new color as often as
possible and begged others to
do the same.) So what are you
whining about, you’re proba-
bly thinking. They gave you an
opportunity and you lost. Suck
it up!

Well, you’re right. But not
entirely. The people at the
M&M’s company were
sneaky. Let me ask you, how
many of you knew about the 1-
800-FUN—COLOR hotline?
My guess is probably not a lot.
They advertised on television
during prime kiddy TV shows‘,
like Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers and Rug Rats. The
voters were children, notori-
ously famous for being attract-
ed to ﬂashy colors and gaudy
glitz. They haven’t been
around long enough to see all
of the new technology failures
like we have. But we, the peo-
ple who have loved and sup-
ported M&Ms for decades,
have been shut out!

To the people at the M&M
company, let me give you a lit-
tle advice. Two words —
Crystal Pepsi. Remember that?
Was that a revolution in the
world of fizzy beverages for
one month, or two? I can’t
remember. Whatever the
answer, the point is that it
failed miserably.

When are companies going
to realize that sometimes peo-
ple don’t want change? I
thought that when you were on
to a good thing, you were sup-
posed to stick with it. By
changing M&Ms, they are
throwing them into a race with
a thousand other companies
trying to get ahead with a
catchy new gimmick.
Technology is great. But it is
great in the form of a new
computer or some other kind
of industrialization that will
get us ahead, not in a new
shade of food dye!

I like M&Ms the way they
are. They taste good, and there
are only 10 grams of fat in a
bag. But there are other rea-
sons too. It is nice to know that
something so good has been
around for such a long time. In

a world where violence and
hatred grow stronger every
day, I like being able to count
on certain things, like knowing
that M&Ms will always be the
same. I guess they’re kind of
like a $.55 bag of security.
Besides, I liked the old color
scheme —— brown, green,
orange, red, tan and yellow.
They had some kind of a
nature theme going. Red, yel-
low and orange —— the color of
a brilliant sun. And green, tan
and brown‘— the base of our

9 Earth’, the‘t‘re‘es"and theigrouiid.

Very eco-conscious. Very chic.
Neither pink, purple nor blue
fits well into this nature sce-
nario. I guess they could repre-
sent something — pink for
bunnies, purple for ﬂowers and
blue for blueberries. But it just
looks strange. .

Well, people, we have two
choices. We can sit by and
watch corruption take place, or
we can do something about it.
Fellow Americans, just say no!
Here’s your opportunity to
finally make a difference in the
world, and I think if we work
together, we can do it. All it
will take is a little patience, a
few postage stamps and the
ability to complain. M&Ms
specifically states in their
Quality Promise, “We will
replace this product if you are
unsatisfied. Just return the
unused portion and wrapper
and tell us the problem, includ-
ing when and where ‘ you
bought it.” 9

It’s too easy! Simply return
the new M&Ms accompanied
by a letter POLITELY asking
them to return to the former
color scheme./I can picture it
now —— hundreds of mail

trucks lined up, waiting to.

deposit envelopes filled with
the new M&Ms. It shouldn’t
be long before they hear our
cries and succumb ‘to our
demands. That address is:

And by the way, the new

’Bo knows
comeback’

Columnist he

came on

Tuesday night, and it sent a
dagger through the hearts of
bandwagon sports fans
everywhere.

“Bo knows retirement.”

The former two-sport,
then one-sport, star has now
become a family man.

This news could not have
come soon enough, because
let’s face it, B0 was an
above-average baseball
player at best.

Sure, he did some wonder-
ful things in his baseball
career, due to his natural
athletic talent, not his base-
ball ability. Anyone can
watch the clips of B0 throw-
ing out a speedy Harold
Reynolds at home plate with
a perfect, on-the-fly, warn-
ing track bullet. And how
about Bo leading off the
All-Star game with a 440-
foot home run off of fire-
baller Rick Rueschel.

Sure, some things look
favorable in Bo’s final sta-
tistics. He hit a home run
once every 17.1 times at
bat. This puts him ahead of

- such players as Reggie

Jackson, Joe DiMaggio and
Roger Maris. But doesn’t
Seattle Mariner oufielder
Jay Buhner (who?) average
a home run every 14 at

—  bats?

During his playing days,
Bo could do one thing better
than any other major lea-
guer —— strike out, For his
career, Bo struck out one
out of every 2.7 at bats.

Bo’s eight-year stats look
modest at best. He finished
his career with a whopping
.249 batting average, 141
home runs (that’s 17.6 a
year, a big power output)
and 452 RBI.

Now, it’s obvious that his
numbers dropped after his
hip replacement surgery, but
he ranks on the career list
behind such unknowns as
former Pirate Jason
Thompson, the only major
leaguer to hit a home run in
every ballpark; Mets’
Howard Johnson, the man of
30-30 fame; and catcher
Matt Nokes.

Where are all the commer-
cials for these guys?

The Bo that people should
miss is Bo the football play-

is one of the best ever to

Najuma Fletcher has been V

one of the success stories out
of many for the track program,
as she has provided stability as
well as leadership for the
Panthers, taking her skills to
another level this year. ‘

“She’s the best I’ve seen,”
coach Steve Lewis said.
“She’s the best female colle-
giate athlete in the nation.
She’s like a team within her-
self.”

Fletcher has been a constant
all year for the Panthers as she
became the Big East champion
for thesecond year in a row in
the long jump, triple jump and
the high jump. She also holds
school records in these events.

A native of East Coast
Demerara, Guyana, she wasn’t
highly recruited by other
schools.

“Coach Lewis recruited me. ' 8:

Not many people have ever
heard of Guyana, much less an
athlete from Guyana,” Fletcher
said.

Everyone else missed the
boat in not seeing what kind of
talent she has.

“We don’t depend on her for
our success,” Lewis said, “but
she does affect other teams.”

Her affect on other teams is
in the loss column, as she usu-
ally finishes in the top four in
any event she participates.
She’s described in the team
media guide as a multi-event,
but it should say multi-talent-'
ed. '

“Najuma is an exceptional
athlete,” Lewis said. “We have
many athletes that are on a
college level, but Najuma is on
a national level.”

Fletcher, one of the nation's finest

Courtesy of Sports Informatio

Najuma Fletcher is a two-time All-American.

Exceptional is a goodword
to describe her, as she also
holds Pitt’s record in the hep-
tathalon, which includes the
55-meter hurdles, the high
jump, shot put, long jump and
the 800-meter run. She is also
the Big East champion in that
event

Fletcher represented her
country in the ‘92 Olympics
just before she became a stu-
dent at Pitt.

She also has been an All-
American for Pitt as a sopho-
more and a junior. And she has
a big familiy here that cheers

everything she does.

“We are a very big family
unit,” Fletcher said. “We all
look out for each other, and we
all support each other.”

Her motivation is the com-
petition and all of the pre-meet
work that’s involved.

“My motivation is to be suc-
cessful, you’re not going to
feel good if you don’t do
well,” Fletcher said. “After
that, it’s the competition and
wanting it.”

With a major in mechanical
engineering, Fletcher doesn’t

Pitt to face Hall's ace this weekend

By Brad Isles
Staff Writer

The Panther baseball team
will look to improve on its
l0-0 home record‘ this week-
end with a three-game
matchup against conference
rival Seton Hall. Pitt is 19-7
overall and 3-3 in the Big
East, and fresh off a sweep of
St. John's last weekend.

“They’re good competi-
tion,” said Tedde Campbell.
“It’s important to get a cou-
ple wins.”

Seton Hall comes in boast-
ing a 16-7 record, 4-1 in con-
ference action. They were 2-
1 last weekend against
Villanova.

The games will feature four
starting pitchers with a com-
bined total of four losses.

Leading the way for the
Pirates on the mound is ace
Matt Morris, the league’s top
major league prospect (5-1,
2-0). His 2.68 ERA (1.20 in
the Big East) is second
among starters, and he has
only allowed 32 hits versus

Jeff Montgomery and the 19-7 Panthers will host Seton Hall
this weekend at Trees Field.

186 batters, while striking
out 57 in 43.2 innings
pitched.

Also likely to see action is
Jason Grilli, who has a 4-1
record while posting a 1.80
ERA in 30 innings of work.

Hall pitchers are holding
Big East opponents to a pal-
try 1.13 earned runs and .186
batting average on the sea-
son.

dent life, she said, but she’s
not here for the social life.

“Your first priority is acade-
mics, and after that is track,”
Fletcher said. “After that is
whatever else. Academics is
why you’re here.”

She’s been home every sum-

.mer since she came here as a
freshman. She likes Pittsburgh, '

but it’s not home, she said.

“Nothing compares to home.
It’s hard being away from
home,” Fletcher said.

Although she was named
Outstanding Performer at both
the indoor and outdoor Big
East Championships last year,
Fletcher still believes in hard
work.

“She puts in extra time, and
her speed has improved dra-
matically this year,” assistant
coach Joanne Warner said.

Bom in 1974 to Fitzroy and
Gem, Fletcher has two broth-
ers, one in high school and one
in college. She said that nei-
ther has an interest in track,
and she won’t be recruiting her
youngest brother for coach
Lewis because he doesn’t like
the sport. _

She will be appearing in
Sports Illustrated’s “Faces in
the Crowd” feature. All of this
attention for a sport that every
kid in her town participated in.

“I tried track and I liked it,”
Fletcher said. “It was some-
thing that every little child did
at home. The major sport for
school age children at home
was track —— it’s gotten me to
school.”

The competition is what dri-
ves her, and at the same time,
she said, she really doesn’t
worry about what anyone else
is doing.

Imagine having the chance to inter-
view a man whose last film revolved
entirely around the high concept of a
young man who can only have sex with a
woman if it's, well, a back door thang.

Whaddya say?

Gee, those ingenious mouth harp nois-
es (kind of a BOING! BO/NG! sound)
that accompany every tight close up of a
woman's rear end, well Russ, how did ya
come up with that one?

Or, what gave you the idea to shoot the

scene where the housewife gets balled

by the garbageman through the bare
bedsprings from underneath the bed?
The filmmaker is Russ Meyer, the film
is his hilarious softcore romp, Beneath
The Valley of The Ultravixens (which I’d
just rented the night before as part of my
laborious research effort) and I suppose
that’s just what it is to interview one of
the world’s pre-eminent perverts. I
So when I saw a man looking 60-some-
thing standing by the counter at the»

Oakland Beehive slurping on an ice

cream cone and ogling a trio of young
nubiles ordering their cappuccinos, I fig-
ure this here’s gotta be the King O’ Titty.
So I walk up to introduce myself and
catch the still glazed look on his big,

bright eyes as he tries to shake my hand

and wipe off the ice cream that’sdribbling
down his chin while still glancing back at
this mini gaggle of girlies. ‘ '

I take a look as the threesome take
their drinks and pass us by, and I think to
myself that they don't exactly fit" the Russ
Meyer mold (not a big bust among them),
until I realize that he’s probably just siz-
ing them up for silicone implants.

“Nah, I like the real thing,” Meyer said
without hesitation. How else does he like
his women? ‘'I like smart women  if
they get your nuts off easily, over and
over again. I got one now like that." And
old Buss lunches into a blow-by-blow

screen? “The atti-
tude with regards
to Pussycat is very

ment. lt’s the most
popular video I
have.” C’mon
Russ, I’m tryin’ to
make. you look
legitimate. “But
Pussycat largely is
purchased by
women.” Thank
you, sir.

Russ Meyer films
have huge cult
appeal. They’re
packed with clever
camp comedy,

Hon and even
some critical admi-
ration. Intentional‘
art or just low-bud-

I progressed, I got ’“

enough money to finance it. Of course
the first one was the one that started the
kitty. The Immortal Mr. Teas made a lot
of money. The first "week my partner and
I, we each bought a_CadiIlac.”

So much for high art pretensions, and
maybe that’s why I liked him so much.
His attitudes could hardly be seen as
aveblown art-house sentiment. Besides,
this is all coming from a guy who’s sup-
posedly 72 years old (though he barely

. looks 60, and if you believe his stories it

ain’t from all the clean livin’ he's been
doing)

So where did “America's Breast
Director’ learn his craft? Russ Meyer was
a combat cameraman in WW II. ‘‘I landed
in Normandy. It was wonderful. I loved it.
I loved the war. I didn’t want the fucking
war to end.. I would have to go home and
get a job. I got all the chow I want. I get

 What am I gonna do, go back and ‘

But he did come back and worked as a

photographer and later for an industrial

filmmaker. ‘T hat was the best. Railroads,
oil companies, paper mills. We’d go out
and shoot with 16mm Cinespecials 
And there was still something like the

‘glamour of making films. Like if you were

shooting something for a railroad, there’d
always be shots for continuity in an office
and there was always a surefire lay in
that secretarial pool of like 20 broads.
And then we’d move on and make some
other kind of film, and that’s the way to
learn. Keep shooting, keep shooting.” Not
to mention screwing, eh?

The straight questions seemed to bore
Russ, and he decided to tell me about

the little routine Jack

who won’t “put out.” A
little something Mr.
Nicholson shared with
Mr. Meyer at one of
those little Hollywood
gatherings. “Jack says
to the girl, ‘No? Well
now, what am I gonna

says ‘Who's Steve?’
Then Jack pulls his dick
out and says, ‘That’s
Steve”' Russ laughs
loudly and says, ‘‘I
always thought that was
a good idea. You ought
to keep it in mind,” he
tells me. Yeah, thanks
for the advice there,
buddy.

back on track when I
ask him about working
with actresses. “Not
interested. llike strip-
pers.” And he tells me
how he’s modeled the
girls in his movies after
the looks and acts of the
great American topless
dancers of the 1950s,

Nicholson uses on ‘girls -

But Russ got.

 
      

women like Lilly St. Cyr and Tempest
Storm.

And blue is where Meyer made his‘

mark in the early 1960s until, with Faster
Pussycat! Kill! Kill! in 1966‘, his special

 ‘blend. of.T&A with a twist crossed over

into wider appeal and Hollywood came
calling. Russ said he was surprised when
Fox accepted he and Roger ‘thumbs up”
Ebert's screenplay for Beyond the Valley
of the Dolls, but took the chance and ran
with it. “[Fox’s famed moguls Da'rryl
Zanuck and David Brown] gave me a
new Corvette and gave George Stevens’
office, and it had a bed that came outof
the wall.” Ya don’t say? But Russ says it
was all pretty much that simple and easy.
He got to pick his crew and cast the pic-
ture himself. Zanuck gave him control of
a $2 million budget. “Well, they didn’t
know what to make of us." What more
could he ask for?

If Meyer's recollections appear to be
just the dirty little fantasies of an old man,
you could be right. But you can't discount
that he got his kicks and doesn't look
worse for wear. Meyer's 21 films don't lie,
and like he says about a film, ‘‘I make it
for me and I'm pleased. I laugh at it  I
mean they're cartoons."

Meyer bristles at the term “soft core.”
“|t’s a term I. don’t like. I was so far ahead
of those guys. Those are tags they give
you. Talk.to me and I'll tell you I’m a car-
toonist.” Well, whatever you think of old
Russ, those cartoons are still damn funny
— crude, crass and cool as the man who
made them.

According to Meyer his Pussycat star-

lets have all “held up well,” and it seems

that he has too — he's a convincing argu-
ment for a life wasted on T&A. But after
listeningto the man, you've gotta wonder
if Meyer's girls aren't really just a reflec-
tion of himself. Like the Faster Pussycat
theme says, “Pussycat is livin’
reckless/Pussycat is ridin’ high/If you
think that you can tame her, well joist you
try.” Pushing three quarters of a century
and currently working an a film starring

' his girlfriend (of course) in addition to this

promotional tour for Pussycat, Russ
Meyer is one loose cannon still daring us
to shut his filthy mouth.

Farinelli

_ Directed by Gerard Corbiau

With Stefano Dionisi and Enrico
Lo Verso

The story goes like this. In the

18th century it was common
practice for young boys whose
families aspired for them to
‘become opera performers to be
castrated before puberty. The
practice assured that their voic-
es would not crack and would
retain the power of a man's
voice and the high pitch of a
woman's. '

Such was the case with Carlo
Broschi, whose performance

name was Farinelli. He was cas-
trated at the age of 10 and
became one of the most famed
castrati in a canon including
Caffarelli, Porporino, Sensinno
and Bemacchi. '

As a result of his castration
and years of study under a pre-
eminent music teacher, Porpora
(Omero Antonutti), Farinelli’s
voice boasted a range of 3 1/2
octaves, and he could sing 250
notes in a row, boosting his leg-
end to quasi-mythical propor-
tions. Women fainted regularly
during his performances, Handel
(Jeroen Krabbe) actively sought
his services, it is rumored his

lowing one opera an admiring
woman told Farinelli, ‘‘I believe
you are responsible for my first
musical orgasm.”

The crux of the film Farinelli,
then, focuses on the soap opera
life surrounding Carlo (Stefano
Dionisi) and his brother Riccardo
(Enrico Lo Verso), who com-
posed Farinelli’s music, and the
women they aIso.shared -
Farinelli‘ initiated sex and
Riccardo “planted the seed.”
With costumes that should
prompt more than a double-take
from Priscilla designers, lavish
scenary, opium-induced white
horse sequences, extended
solos from Farinelli, the film is
also a meticulously constructed
piece of artwork that appeals

' more to the emotions than the

intellect. .

Much of the plot dynamics are
driven by the conflicts between
Riccardo and Carlo and their
falling out, the tension between
Farinelli and Handel, and the
romances that included
Margaret Hunter (Caroline
Cellier) and her niece Alexandra
(Elsa Zylberstein). .

By the conclusion, Farinelli
becomes rather phantasmagoric
with heavy-handed symbolism,
which is something of a relief fol-
lowing endless scenes delivered
with Merchant-Ivory restraint
and seriousness. Farinelli
always knew his voice required
better compositions than his
brother could provide, so with

“the help of Alexandra he per-

formed a Handel piece without
the virtuoso’s permission.

At this time, the schism
between Carlo and Riccardo
had become complete, and the
eclipse sequence that follows

_ shortly after nails down the

point. Riccardo's selfish motiva-
tions become clear, as he is
linked to the moon that hides the
light, and who has sealed Carlo
in an earth/tomb.

' Although there is a strong
sense of Carlos loss as a result
of his castration, what the movie
leaves out, however, is any indi-
cation of the numbers of other
young boys who weremutilated
and whose lives were destroyed
by the practices of castrati. For
every androgynous opera super-
star who -achieved Farinelli’s
fame, you can bet many more

were destroyedby their castra- «

tion. Farinelli nevertackles such
issues, instead opting for a high
art portrait and straightforward
melodrama, and delivers an
engaging and lavish piece of
filmmaking.

I guess we should not only
thank Manny Theiner, but also
good ole Hank Rollins and Rick

Rubin have formed the much-
talked-about label Infinite Zero,
which reissues classics from
Devo, Gang of Four (I've been
told) and the Contortions. These
out-of-print albums are now out
on the market and are available
to rescue you from the doldrums
of College Rock. I don't know if
Chance had been playing in/with
the Contortions format recently .
or if the reissue sparked a
reunion. The only thing that mat- ,
ters is that it is happening.  *

Who are the Contortions?? In .
1977 Chance formed the group, - .
fresh from Milwaukee with a 
penchant for sax-strangling alto
madness. The group had a han-
dle for the funk and a punk rock
disposition. Sax, bass, guitar

like this. The band was featured
on the Eno produced No New

York comp. Alongside the likes
of Lydia Lunch, the Contortions
were at home, but they were the
weird neighbors that spooked
the hell out of you. They play
James Brown! I don't how chaos
can move and groove — thank
god the Contortions do.

Their sound has been deemed
“subversive,” and Rolling Stone
considered Chase (then White)
to be the “closest thing we have
to Johnny Rotten.” Well, in 1979
I guess this would be quite flat-
tereing. The comment was
made in the magazines review
of the 1979 gem Buy the
Contortions. The band was
unlike anything punk had seen
or would see.

’ The group combines diverse
musical genres and raw power
that just kills any pansy cross
over fusion ensemble. With
songs like “Design to Kill,” “Don’t
Want to be Happy” and “Contort
Yourself,” the band made skro-
nkin' No Wave sting. If I could
think of one band that elicited
such a strong, vaguely similar
reaction after the first listen, it's
the Minutemen. Both groups jam
wrecklessly but manage to stay
tight. The cliché “Flying by the
seat of your pants” seems to
express this phenomeon. Chase
was no amateur either; he had
classical training, so his noise is
easily rationalized with intelli-
gencia. Whatever. The man
walls, and unforunately, he
tamed a bit inthe mid ‘80s, leav-
ing the Contortions to be

remembered.

Pieces of You
Jewel
Atlantic

Long, scraggly, blond tresses
and a folk guitar — where have
we seen that before? In the
immortal words of Swen/edriver,
“you find it everywhere.” But,
just ‘wook at ‘er! The wittle blue-
eyed Hatfield/Joplin wannabe
who wants to save the world
with six strings and a photogenic
pout. OK, OK, I won’t be bitter.
lt’s just that ever since Tori
Amos landed, a bunch of. bub-
bling, blond, baby-faced, rocker
broads have been trying to
storm her shuttle. Juliana
Hatfield (who needs to lay off of
the helium), Liz Phair (whose
album title will be the closest
she’ll ever get to stardom) and
now “Jewel” Kilcher continues
the lineage of bored, pseudo-tal-
ented darby chics. They really
should get a life because
nobody can do it like Tori.

Listening to Pieces of You is
like gulping down a big jar of
honey — its sweet and all, but
it'll still make you throw up. I
apologize for the harshness, I’m
just trying to save you money.

‘lt’s not that Pieces of You is '

unbearable, lt’s just.unbearabIe.
It reeks of too much moral fiber

and environmental bullshit._
Folksy songs about racism, drug

abuse, sexism, television —
please, don’t do us any favors.
lt’s all so cliché. I don’t even
want to go into detail about the
songs. It you listen to one,
you’ve listened to all 14. It's all
down home, operatic, coffee
house, acoustic shit. Jewel
writes great starry-eyed poetry,
and I kinda like what she has to
say about waits, but that’s just
about it. Awww, but she's so
cute!

Little Jewel grew up in Homer,
AIa., with no running water or
television. I suppose she was
raised by wolves too — it proba-
bly enhanced her creativity.

Nope. Pieces of You is anything
but creative. It contains all of the‘

idealistic garbage that cynics
(such as myself) love to hate.

“So please be careful with me,

I’m sensitive/and I'd like to stay
that way/you always tell me that
it's impossible/to be respected
and be a girl/Why's it gotta be so
complicated?" she tweets, in her
grating musical catharsis entitled
“l’m Sensitive.” Too bad! ‘‘I
believe in Angels,” (no kidding)
she replies in response to this
ear-splitting, eye-twitching piece
of crap called “Angel Standing
By." God, I'm getting a tummy
ache from all of the sap.

Jewel's best bet is to stickto

"Seventeen modeling and coffee

house poetry readings. Her
sound is not appealing unless
you're a depressed feminist. I
have nothing against pretentious
female Caucasoids. White soul
sistas, unite!!! Just don’t do it in
my stereo.

There are very few bands
whom I have loved as much as I
love The Fall. This is in spite of
the fact that for almost 10 years
now, with an average of one
album out every year, it has
consistantly seemed that their
finest work is behind them. If
there are any Fall fans left out
there, there is reason to rejoice.
The Fall are back, and this is
their best album in a decade.

Continuing in their tradition of
completely pretentious-sounding
album titles and horribly ugly
album covers, Cerebral‘ Caustic
is a damn fine PUNK ROCK

barrage of distortion and

Stone_s,” Kate Beck fronts a
band ready to take on anyone.
The best word to describe
their sound is accessible. The
term “alternative rock,” thrown
upon them by Pittsburgh critics,
doesn't do them justice. Bassist
Marc Figallo and drummer Tom
Emmerling set the pace for most
songs with a tempo that varies
from funk to rock. Add to that
guitarists Buzz and Paul Labrise
playing everything from ‘70s

. punk riffs to acoustic folk.

While the lyrical content strays

L away from being overtly political,

as their resume boasts, the
band prefers to voice their opin-

I can only say they sound
like the blues, but better quali-
fied they are the blues.

Hard Times compromises
seven songs of indie rock and
the incompetence of feeling
good. The album’s opener,
“Just Can’t Win,” found me stu-
pid and inspired. lt’s got
rhythm. lt’s got rock. It's gotten
overplayed by me. I dig it. The
screeching and howling of the

l Brannon’s voice, Strickland’s
out-of-control guitar and the
powerful emotion will kiss your

' ass into liking the song.

‘ “Slump” enters with a jump-

E ing riff that almost smoothers

1 your ears into noticing the
tune. The voice is tremendous
as ‘ever, more twisting than his

‘ vocal offensive with his ex-

band Negative Approach.

l Frustration is defined on
“You're So Cruel.” This is
where salvation starts in music,
the consequences of good
lyrics. V

In the end, the album is
intense, fun and rock ‘n’ roll.
Somewhere Exile on Main St.
and the John Spencer Blues
Explosion were gonna meet.
Any street corner would have
been good. But they forgot to
invite the Laughing Hyenas to
the gig.

Luciano’s Cafe is where the
Laughing’ Hyenas will be play-
ing. Opening are Nebraska’s
Sideshow and local’s
Blunderbuss. All-ages, $6.

“I’m looking forward to it,
if that’s who I get,”
Campbell said of a possible
matchup against Morris. “I
think it’s a chal-

someone of that
caliber, and it’s

boasts a strike-

of 24-6 in 164 batters faced.
He’s holding teams to a .203

Panther pitchers will be

a freshmen squad, fared well
for being in a varsity event.

“We A were definitely
pleased with the results,”
captain Sean Denney said.
“The reason we performed
well is that our coach had us
working on our starts and
higher stroke ratings based
on the fact that last week we
had to play catch-up during
the body of the race due to
slow starts.”

“The team’s preparation
was nothing special,” coach
Peter Morgan said. “We just
trained on the normal
course, emphasizing increas-
ing our strength and
endurance at higher
cadences. By the end of the
season, cadences will be
even higher.”

The Pitt women’s crew.

team also enjoyed some suc-
cess. The lightweight four
team placed first. Then that
same team competed as a
heavyweight team and
placed second.

“We just wanted to see
what would happen with the
lightweight team competing
in the heavyweight divi-
sion,”
Susan Land.

The women’s novice eight
placed third.

Two weeks ago the crew
team had its first meet in
Philadelphia, and now the
team is looking ahead to the

Camden, N.J.

“We got our start almost
right, so we will have to
see what’s in store ‘for next
week when the competition
will be a bit tougher,”

down the sidelines in an
Auburn uniform, bounce off
what seemed like 30
Alabama defenders and
score his fifth touchdown of
the game.

Bo won the 1985 Heisman
Trophy in one of the biggest
landslide votes of all-time.

Then he was selected first
overall in the 1986 draft by
the lowly Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.

“Bo don’t know Tampa.”

In the biggest mistake of
what would have been a
Hall-of-Fame career, Bo .
turned down millions to sign

on with the Kansas City
Royals.

Then the following year
when a team with a winning
tradition, the L.A. Raiders,
drafted him in the seventh
round, Bo suddenly re-
embraced the sport that
made him who he was.’

During his “spare time,”
Bo played in 38 NFL games.
In those games he gained
2,782 yards and averaged
5.5 yards a carry. Not bad
for a “hobby.”

Remember that Monday
night game when Bo ran all
over Brian Bosworth and the
Seattle Seahawks for 220

yards, the only time a run-
ning back had two 90-yard
carries in the same game?
Probably.

~ Remember when it took
B0 22 at-bats to get his first
major league hit, a trickling
single off of Steve Carlton?
Probably not.

With the recent wave of
comebacks popping up in
professional sports, let’s just
hope that two years from
now at a press conference
somewhere we don’t hear:

“Bo knows comebacks.”

“You can’t lose focus on
what you’re there for,”

Fletcher said. “Concentrating
on what anybody else is doing
is going to detract from your
own performance.”

She has ran her entire career
at Pitt without any major
injuries. “Knock on wood,”
Fletcher said.

But what will she do once
she gets her degree?

“After I graduate I'm going
to go on to graduate school.
That gives me two more years
to decide exactly what I want
to do,” Fletcher said.

Does that include the ‘96

Olympics?

“l996 would be a good year
to try and compete.”

She wins almost every week
and she still believes she needs
improvement, and there are
those who agree.

“She needs a lot of help in
her throws, that’s the main
thing,” Warner said.

“You always have that ner-
vous factor, but you go out and
do the best you can,” Fletcher
said.

If that’s the only chink in her
armor, the competition has to
be worried every time they
hear Fletcher’s coming to their
town.
