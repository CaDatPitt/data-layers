To the victors come the spoils...

Okay, so they won. However, the fine ladies and gentlemen of Happy Valley weren't going anywhere, as the 57,158

spectators swarmed the streets after Saturday's game, preventing many cars from going anywhere. Traffic was stopped for

‘up to thirty minutes, so the Lions got a lesson in city living.

Blacks not equally represented in tenure

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

There is an "inadequate"
number of black Pitt faculty
members presently tenured or
on the tenure track at the
University of Pittsburgh,
according to Dr. Jack Daniel, a
Pitt associate provost.

Though Pitt currently has an
Affirmative Action policy like most
other major U.S. universities,
Daniel said that at Pitt, “the normal
search procedures have thus far
yielded inadequate results.

“‘We are an Affirmative Action
employer’ has become almost a
cliche . among American
universities,” said Daniel. “Even
though there is nothing wrong
with our present policy, we, as
the current provost’s ofﬁce, are
trying to get better results.”

In an attempt to do so, the
provost’s office has determined
the exact number of black tenured
and tenure-trackfaculty members
in each of Pitt’s 18 university
colleges over the past five years.

According to a statistical report
issued on Sept. 13 of this year,
there are currently 46 tenured
and 12 tenure-stream, full-time
black faculty members teaching
on Pitt’s ﬁve campuses. This
means that 3.5 percent of Pitt’s
approximately 1,600 full_—time
faculty members are black.

The report also indicates that
five of the current 58 black faculty
members are academic

administrators who do no
classroom teaching, and only two
of the 58 were hired in the past
year. .

Of the 18 intra-university
schools, six had no full—time black
faculty tenured or in the tenure
stream for at least three
consecutive years since 1985.
These schools include the Katz
School of Business, the School of
Dental Medicine, the Graduate
School of Public Health, the
School of Health-Related
Professions, the School of Nursing
and the School of Pharmacy.

Of these six, only one, the
business school, has hired a black
faculty member in the past year.

According to H. J. Zoffer, dean
of Pitt’s business school, “the
major problem is that the pool of
black faculty members in
management is virtually
nonexistent”

Zoffer said that despite the
roughly 700 business schools in
tlie United States granting
doctorate degrees, the number of

blacks who graduate from these
schools in any given year varies
between six and 12.

“We have been in competition
for black faculty members for
years, and sometimes we have
come extremely close,” he said.

“We need to hire persons who
are likely to be successful in our
environment, but we will not try
to pad the statistics by hiring just
any black faculty member."

Because of the limited pool of

‘ potential black business faculty

who have done work in the area
of business management, Zoffer

. said that many schools are trying

to attract black faculty specializing
in other disciplines related to
business management.

He explained that the most
recent black instructor to join the
business school faculty
transferred from a teaching
position in Pitt’s psychology
department and now does
psychological research in the
discipline of business
management.

Daniel’s plan for increasing
the. number of black full-time
faculty members at Pitt is
multifaceted.

One way, according to Daniel,
is to cite “targets of opportunity.”
Such a situation arises when there
is an outstanding candidate who
is available and willing to become
Pitt faculty but there has not
been prior approval for such a
faculty position. ’

According to Daniel, the
current provost’s office is willing
to grant such approval.

Another way the provost’s
office plans to increase the
number of black faculty members
at Pitt is by concentrating minority
hiring efforts on departments in
the university where there is an
underrepresentation or no
representation of black faculty.

Over the next five-year period,
Daniel said he would like to see
a 33 percent overall increase in

the number of full-time black
faculty members at Pitt.

Blacks “bring added intellectual
perspectives to the university”
which, he said, by definition “is a
place that deals with ideas.”

“When the university is working
well,” Daniel said, “I don’t think
that ideas should be
homogenized.”

Robert Harper, a black
professor at the Pitt School of
Law, said he is very happy with
what he called “an excellent
program” of interviewing and
hiring minorities for open
positions on the law school
faculty.

Explaining that at present, the
law school is planning to fill
several faculty positions emptied
at the close of last term, Harper
said, “We have interviewed
several black candidates with
outstanding credentials.

“We are successful in attracting
minorities and women because
of our reputation as one of the
top 20 law schools in the U.S.,”
he said. '

Daniel said that the minority

_employment plans presently

being formulated by the provost’s
office will begin affecting hiring
decisions as early as September
1990.

According to Daniel, “if black
faculty, administrators and
students do in academia what
they have done in athletics, they
will transform higher education."

Civil 

By Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

Sodomy laws and
discrimination in the armed

services were two of the issues
talked about by Pitt’s Gay and
Lesbian Alliance during a
discussion on civil rights for
gays and lesbians last Thursday.
Although Pennsylvania has not
had sodomy laws since 1980,
many states still have laws that
prohibit sodomy for
heterosexuals and homosexuals
or just homosexuals.
According to Mark Smith, co-
president of GALA, “the courts
were instrumental in protecting
privacy and basic rights at one

, time. lt’s a shame that they are

backing out on this.”

Another topic discussed was
civil rights laws. Only Wisconsin ,
has statewide civil rights laws
for gays and lesbians.

“What is so special about basic
human rights? We are a minority,
so people want to take away the
rights we do have,” said Smith.

However, he was also
optimistic. “Dan Cohen has
promised to introduce legislation
to change civil rights laws.”

One problem discussed was
police harassment on Dithridge
Street in North Oakland, where

gays and lesbians have been -

known to gather.

One man who attended the
meeting said, “I have the Fourth
Amendment right to be free in
my person and the Fourth
Amendment right to assemble.
We need more education about
what the U.S. Constitution says.
People are getting tossed around

because of their lack of
knowledge.”
According to Smith, the

organization Cry Out! has kept a
record of this harassment and
has told them “try not to confront

them, [because] people have 

gotten beat up on Dithridge.”
One factor that was cited as
possibly beneficial to the gay
movement is the notion of
redefinition of the family. There
has been more gay and lesbian
families, and marriages between
members of the same sex have
been legalized in Denmark.
Another problem is the US.

military exclusion policy. Gays”

and lesbians have been kicked
out or denied re—en.l_istment even
though the Pentagon has found
gays to be less of a security
threat. 9,

But for lesbians in the military,
“the lower court decisions have
been in our favor,” said Smith.

‘‘It’s important to complain. If
we sit here and take it, they’ll
think they can get away with it,”
he added..

 

Nov. 20 — A Pitt student
reported that a man in a car
pulled up beside her in Schenley
Plaza and began masturbating.
The man stayed in the plaza for
approximately half an hour. The
student stated that this is the
third_ time she has witnessed
such an incident. The same man
was involved in each case.

Nov. 21 —-A Towers custodian
was injured when she slipped
and fell in the first ﬂoor men’s
room in Tower C.

Nov. 22 —— A campus police
vehicle was damaged when a
garage door closed on top of the
car as itwas being driven into
the Towers garage.

Nov. 22 —— A knife was
confiscated from a patient at
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic.

PIT!‘ HOOPS, THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 28, 1989

Georgetown, Syracuse top Big East coaches ’ poll

Many people have Syracuse over for him.

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

There are few surprises in this
year's Big East Coaches’
Preseason Poll. Georgetown is
No. 1, and Syracuse is No. 2. Yes,
Boston College is a convincing
last again. But one never knows
what can happen during the
season.

“Looking at it on paper,
Georgetown and Syracuse should
be No. 1,” said Georgetown Coach
John Thompson. “Butby the same
token, you have to take it further.
I wouldn't underestimate Pitt and
Villanova. In competition, there
are a lot of teams that can cause
problems for Georgetown and
Syracuse on any given night.”

V Pitt Coach Paul Evansis not
very impressed with his No. 3
preseason ranking.

“You could put Georgetown

and Syracuse on the top and mix
the other seven any way you
want. That's how I see it,” said
Evans.

Georgetown will have a
different look this year. The Hoyas
lose play-maker Charles Smith’s
18.7 points per game, but they
keep the dominating inside game
of Alonzo Mourning. Mourning
is on most preseason, ﬁrst—team
all—American lists. Mourning had
13.1 points and over seven
rebounds per game last season.

The 7—foot—2 center from Zaire,
Dikembe Mutombo, will be
blocking shots inside with
Mourning. But Hoya Coach John
Thompson realized they can’t do
it alone.

“You can have all the big
people in the world, but if you
don't have good people in the
backcourt who know how to
administer the game, you’re in

   
 

Get Your .
“ HOOPS” -UP

for CAPRI ,

trouble,” said Thompson.

Mark Tillmon and Dwayne
Bryant are the people who will
be feeding the big men. Tillmon
is looking forward to seeing
Mourning and Mutombo on the

CONFERENCE

ﬂoor together more this year.

“In half-court situations, we'll
try to get it inside,” said Tillmon.
“Our big guys can cause a lot [of]
problems’. We'll also be running
a lot, so the little guys can get out
on the wings and run.”

  
   

 
   
         
   
     
    
   
  

  

   
  

   

as a top—five team inthe nation.
Jim Boeheim returns three players
who scored in double figures last
season: Stephen Thompson
(18.0), Derrick Coleman (16.9)
and Billy Owens (13.0). Coleman
was named the Preseason Big
East Player of the Year by the
coaches. Owens and Thompson
are on the Big East Second Team.

The Orangemen have to deal
with the loss of Sherman Douglas.
Douglas ran the show for Syracuse
last year, and Thompson (6-4,
1 90 pounds) will probably switch
and take over at point.

“We have to go with our most

» experienced and best defensive

team, and that dictates’ putting
Stephen Thompson at point
guard,” said Boeheim. “_He played
point guard defensively in
practice against Sherman all last
year, so he should be ready.”
Boeheim also used defensive
reasons to explain whyhe isn’t
considering using the 6-9 Billy
Owens at point, despite Owens’
great passing ability. “He would
have to play defense against
guards like [Providence’s] Screen
and Murdock, and if he did that,

Pittsburgh’s sophomores are
now juniors. The Panthers didn’t
lose anybody who saw significant
playing time last year. Two of the
returners, Jason Matthews and
Brian Shorter, were picked on
the Coaches’ Preseason First-
Team All—Big East team.

Mathews’ guard skills and 16.5
points per game will be
complimented by fellow guards
Sean Miller and Darelle Porter.
Miller is nursing a stress fracture
in his foot and should return

‘early in the season.

Shorter (19.6 points per game)
will be joined underneath by
Bobby Martin and newcomer
Darren Morningstar. ’ Martin
poured in 12.2 points per game
last season. Morningstar had to
sitoutlastseason aftertransferring
from Navy. »

All-purpose sixth man Rod

' Brookin, who averaged in double

figures last season, will fill in
wherever and whenever he is
needed. But, once again, the
depth stops there. ’
Depth or not, people are
noticing Pitt. “I'm a little surprised
people aren't’ giving Pitt more

Junior forward Brian Shorter will enter the 1989-90 Pitt basketball
season with some extremely impressive credentials to his name.
After having the finest statistical season of any rookie in the Big East
Conference last season, "Shorter was named as the 1988-89 Big East
Newcomer of the Year; he was selected to the ﬁrst—team, All—Big East
Squad and was named honorable mention All-American- by The
Sporting News. . _ .
In addition, Shorter led the Panthers in scoring (19.6 ppg) and
A rebounding (9.6) and became the highest scoring sophomore in Pitt _
e 1' history.
With the loss of only three players from last season, the Panthers
will again look to Shorter as their key offensive threat.
Shorter was mainly an inside man last year, with players feeding
him the ball so he could operate in the low post. -  A
This season, Shorter believes he has added a-crucial element to his jon Anderson/The Pm News A

In addition to contending with the long-range shots of Darelle

sparingly last season.

a sub-par game in the low post, he could open up his offense to '
outside shooting. This would give Pitt at least three outside scoring  

threats on the ﬂoor at one time.

Matthews’ dedication

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

Panther guard Jason Matthews
spent his summer playing against
tough competition in an effort to
add to his game.

“I want to become an all-around
player, " said Matthews. “Last year
I was just known as a shooter.”

He wasn’t content just being
one of the best long-range
shooters in the Big East
Conference, so he played with
some of the top players in the
country.

Matthews spent part of the
summer playing on a national
team, led by Georgia Tech Coach
Bobby Cremins, that traveled to
Mexico City to compete in the
World Qualification Tournament.

After making it through a rough,
10-day tryout camp at the US.
Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs, he left the
country for the firsttime. Matthews
said that playing on the team was
a beneficial experience.

The team boasted excellent
defensive guards such as Kendall
Gill of Illinois and Gary Payton of
Oregon State. Matthews said their
defensive skills forced him to
drive to the basket, an area of his
game he wanted to improve.

He spent the rest of his summer
at home in Los Angeles playing in
a summer league which included
many top college players such as
Stacey Augmon of UNLV, Stevie
Thompson and Leron Ellis of
Syracuse and Chris Mills and Sean
Higgins of defending champion
Michigan. Matthews played a lot
at point guard while working on
his game; ,

Matthews is looking forward to
the upcoming season, and he
feels he is not the only Panther
who will show some new
strengths. .

“I think all of us improved on
something over the summer.
Darelle [Porter] is hitting his
outside shot consistently,”
Matthews said.

He added that Bobby Martin is
finally shooting “his shot” and
doing more with rebounds.

Since he is entering his third
season with many of the same
teammates, he feels they know
how to help each other improve.

“We put a lot of pressure on
each other. We expect a lot from
each other and push each other
to higher levels,” he said.

Pitt will needto play at high
levels with a schedule that
includes noneconference games
against Georgia Tech, Oklahoma

rewarded

State and Arizona in addition to
the always tough Big East
Conference. “The tough schedule
doesn’t bother me at all,”
Matthews said.

Many people will expect a big ‘

season from Matthews since he is
coming off a 16.5 ppg year, and
he was also named to the
preseason All-Big East Team.

“I don't feel any pressure; that’s
all preseason stuff. It's not what
you do before the season. It’s
what you do during the season,"
said Matthews.

He said the only pressure is
that which he and his teammates
put on each other to improve.

Matthews believes the off-
season weightlifting should help
a lot, not only in strength but also
in stamina. On a team which
lacked depth last season, the
starters. were forced into a great
deal of playing time. He said they
would often be tired at the end of
the game. . A

Matthews definitely feels all of
his off-season work is helping
him progress in his effort to be an
all—around player.

“I think I’m on the right track
and headed in the direction I
want to be,” he said. “I just have
to keep on working hard.”

Benchmen call it quits

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

The Panther basketball team's depth problem took a turn for .

the worse this fall when it was revealed that two of their
experienced players, seniors Nate Bailey and Steve Maslek,
decided to forego their last year of eligibility.

Bailey, a 6-foot 6-inch forward from Weymouth, Mass., plans
on studying law upon graduation from Pitt this year. He left the
team in order to prepare for the LSAT test, an exam required for
entrance into law school. Bailey would like to attend law school
at either Pitt or Boston College. ’

In addition to graduate school preparation, Bailey said, “I’ve

had trouble with my ankles, and the wear and tear has been ‘

hindering me.”

The loss of Bailey could prove to be a signiﬁcant one, and it
will diminish the already paltry Pitt bench. Last season, Bailey
started two games at small forward, and contributed in many
others. »

Even though he is no longer on the squad, Bailey claims he
“is with the team a lot,” and would be willing to come back and
play “if they lose some people [due] to injuries."

Bailey transferred to. Pitt in December 1986 from Navy. He
scored 51 points in his 2-year Pitt career.

In addition to Bailey, Maslek has decided to leave the Panther I

squad as well. Maslek, a 6-foot 9-inch forward/center from
Freedom, Pa., is scheduled to graduate this December, and
decided to forego eligibility in order to complete his academic
requirements.

Over his long career with the Panthers, Maslek has appeared
in a number of games, but saw his most extensive action last
season against Florida when he shut down Gator center
Dwayne Schintzius for much of the game. Used mainly as a
defender and extra rebounder, Maslek scored six points last
season and 40 in his career.

  Ankle injuryhalts Miller's year

- By Matt Martin

Editor in Chief

A congenital ankle injury may
keep two—year starting point

guard Sean Miller out of action
, for the remainder of the season,

 Pitt Coach Paul Evans said

yesterday.

‘‘There’s a pretty good shot he
might be redshirted,” Evans said
Monday atFitzgerald Field House,
where Miller practiced wearing a

' knee-high plastic cast.

Pitt trainer Tony Salesi said
Miller suffers from a “talar
calcaneal coaclition of the left

" subtalar joint. ” In layman’s terms,

Miller , suffers from an
inappropriate fusion of two bones
in the left foot. Following
Friday’s 108-89 victory over the

 

  

--:—:‘2‘-"H-131--‘Tij———:1Z—=—-":1

Soviet Union at the Civic Arena,
Evans said Miller was to be
evaluated Monday and fitted with
a cast.

“We’ll see if he can play the
first three of four games,” Evans
said. "If not, he’ll be redshirted.”

The 6-foot-1 Miller averaged

nearly 10 points and two

rebounds for the Panthers last
season as a sophomore. He
dished out a team—high 181 assists
as well.

Junior Darelle Porter will take
over Miller’s starting spot. Porter
had 11 assists and 14 points
against the Soviet Union.

“.We really miss Sean a lot so
far,” shooting guard Jason
Matthews said Friday. “It’s not

“If it's best for him to get

to play without him,” said Porter.

absence could leave his starting

Porters versatility allows
Pitt to alter its strategies

By Rob Codispot
Staff Writer

. Look up the word jacle-0f-
all-trades in the dictionary,
assuming you can locate a

' dictionary containing that

phrase, and you would ﬁnd
this definition: “one who is
able to "do passable work at
various tasks.” Ask Pitt Panther
basketball fans their
interpretation of the word and,
nine timesout of 10, you will
get a mere two—word answer.

Darelle Porter.

Every contender for the
national championship seems
to have one: the ultimate
coach’s player. In fact, last
year’s Final Four featured four
of the nation's best: Mike
Griffin of Michigan, Steve
Bardo of Illinois, Darryl
Walker of Seton Hall and
Danny Ferry of Duke.

A player offering various
intangible talents to his team
is extremely valuable.

Porter, a\6—foot-4 junior, is
“Mr. Versatility” around these
parts. Panther coach Paul
Evans can and will use him
this season to relieve Brian
Shorter at small ‘forward and
Jason Matthews at shooting.
Porter is accepting the

challenge of playing different
positions with open arms.

“It helps me because I know
I can go in and play against
any type of player,” Porter
said. “And it helps the team a
lot because maybe one game
[the coaches] need me to play
small forward, one game
shooting guard, one game at
the point  No matter what
position it is, they know I can
fill in at that spot.”

‘ Porter may find himself"

getting most of his minutes at
point guard this season. T wo-
year starter Sean Miller has
been hampered by a stress
fracture in his left ankle and
has not practiced since Oct.
15, the first day of practice.
Miller could return as early as
Dec. 1 for the Tournament of
Champions in Charlotte or as
late as next season. Evans is
already considering redshirting
Miller if he is not ready for the
first few games.

In the wake of Miller’s
absence, Porter has stepped
in and performed admirably.

‘ He passed his first true test s

this past Friday night in the
Panthers’ 108-89 victory over
the Soviet. Union Red Army

club. He scored 14 points but, '

more imponantly, dished out 11
assists and committed only three '
turnovers while leading the Pitt
fast break. He was credited with
an assist on eight of the Panthers’
initial nine baskets.

The minuscule three turnovers
will certainly make Evans happy.
lie has said before that Porter
tends to play beyond himself,
sometimes trying to do too much,

. too fast. Evans would like Porter

to tone down his game a tad and
wait for the action to develop,
instead offorcing it. Friday night’s
performance was certainly a start.

“l-le wants me to cut down on
trying to force things to happen,”
he said. “I tend to see things
than , my
teammates; I'm thinking they are
going to do one thing, and they
do another. I just have to [be]
more consistent with my
teammates.”

Consistency is something Porter
craves, especially with his shot.
Last season, he lived up to his

streaky shooter tag, converting

on only /10 percent of his shots,
down considerably from the /19
percent he shot as a freshman.’ He
has been shooting regularly since

the end of last season, going
through a routine devised by the
coaching staff to improve his
marksmanship from spots that
have given him the most difficulty.
Porter’s most difficult spot on
the floor has been the charity
stripe. Free throws were an
adventure for him as a freshman,
hitting only 58.8 percent. But he
improved that mark dramatically
in his sophomore season to a
modest 72.2 clip. Porter plans on
joining teammates Miller and
Matthews as one of the elite free-
throw shooters in the Big East.
“I was shooting 85, 86 percent
this summer,” Porter said. "I’m
shooting for 80 percent this year."
One area of Porter’s game he
does not need to improve is at
the defensive end of the court.
He is without a doubt the
Panthers’ 1 best defensive player,
usually assigned to shadow the
opponent's top offensive whiz.
This season's killer schedule could

pit Porter man-to—man with such.

Anderson, N.C. State's 6-3 Rodney

Harvey and Oklahoma State's 6—_

7 Richard Dumas.

Notice the diversity in the sizes
of the above players. Guarding
players both taller and smaller
than he is nothing new to Porter.
Last season, he guarded players
ranging in size from Seton I-Iall’s
5-4 Pookey Wigington to Florida’s
6-7 Livingston Chatman.

Porter feels he has mastered
the distinctly different styles of
defense needed in handling
guards and forwards.

“With [the smaller players], Itry
to use my size to my advantage?’
Porter said. “I can give them the
extra step because I know I can
recover and deflect his shot.

“With the tall players, I have to
use my quickness and smallness
against him. I have to out-quick
him, beat him to a spot and stay
in front of him. Ican’t let him post
me up.”

Evans is looking for Porter to
be defensively dominant this
season, and “lhe Hawk," as some
Pittstudents have nicknamed him,
is primed to be just that.

“I’m used to guarding the good,
quality players,” Porter said. “I’m
just going to try to shut [opposing
players] do.wn even more this
year to live up to [Evans'l billing.”

“I'm pretty much still with the
inside game. Just on occasions
where a lot of teams are going to
be double-teaming me, I think
I'm going to start off shooting
then. I have confidence in myself
and the shot,” Shorter said.

Guard Jason Matthews had
recently started to drive to the
hoop more often and penetrate
the opposing defense. According
to Shorter, this should take some
of the pressure offhim and open
up the defense to the point where
new scoring opportunities are
created. .

"He [Matthews] can penetrate
more, and when he penetrates
on my side, my man will have a
tendency to try and double—te_am
him. .

“This leaves me open and
makes my shots even easier,"
Shorter said. _

The experience factor will take
an upswing this season as all of
Pitt’s live sophomore starters have
had a year to work with coming
into the 1989-90 campaign. Given
the difficulty of Pitt’s schedule,
both within the conference and
outside, the maturity will
definitely be a factor. ‘

“I think everybody is more
mature about the game and
[knows] what to expect. Last year
we played against a lot of top
teams, and we beat a lot of top
teams, and we see the picture
good now. We can play with
anybody in the country.

“I think- it's going to work -to
our advantage just because of
the experience,” Shorter said.

Morningstar this season, the
Panther frontcourt will also

assume a new look with Shorter,
Martin and Brookin, especially
in situations where Morningstar
comes off the bench.

Panthers a 6—foot-11-inch player
in the frontcourt, a height
advantage they did not have last
year. '

Shorter is confident with any of
the above players on the court
and said that he has developed a
playing rapport with all members
of the Panther frontcouit.

“I feel confident with all of the
guys, and we can depend on
Morningstar coming off of the
bench. '

"He's been a factor coming off
the bench so far, and he's going
to alleviate a lot of pressure off of
me and Bobby [Martin], and he's
going to work out real well,"
Shoner said.

Shorter scored in double figures

in all but two games last year,

including the final 20 games in a
row. One of his best efforts came
against highly ranked Oklahoma,

' where he posted a career-high 37

points and pulled in 12 rebounds
in Pitt’s 99-91 upset. .

He also led the Big East in free
throws made in conference games
with 104. Shorter finished second
in the conference in both overall
and league ‘games in scoring,
rebounding and field-goal
percentage.

His field-goal percentage (.600)
broke Pitt’s previous single-~
season record of .569 set by Curtis
Aiken in 1985-86.

The Panthers have had a year

‘to gel.as_.a team, and after two

preseason exhibition games,
Shorter is well-aware of the
positive aspects of the team and
elements which need to be
worked on.

“The positive thing about us

playing is that we’re all playing _

together, and we realize what it
takes to win. And that's just play
together and play hard every time.

If we do that, we'll‘ do real well,"

Shorter said.
“Also we’re doing. a lot of
running this year, and that's going

’ to help us out a lot."

Concerning potential areas for
team improvement, Shorter
identified a need to maintain a
hard—playing attitude in a winning
situation. “We justhave to
come out with the same intensity
when we’re up 10-15 points; we
have to keep the intensity going
because last year we had a
tendency to slack off. If we keep

it up, I think we'll keep a lot of

teams _out _of the game,” Shorter
"said. ‘

Shorter enters this season with
high expectations from himself
and the fans as well as the media.
As the main offensive threat of a
team that is ranked in the top, 20
by every major preseason poll,
Shorter is looking toward another
excellent season.

Brookin

Continued from page 7

A separated shoulder
hampered the 6—foot-5
sophomore in the early portion
of the 1987-88 season. He
returned Dec. 12 to score 12
second-half points in a come-
from-behind victory at West
Virginia; then scored 18 points
to lead the Panthers to a 72-71
win over Florida State. He played
five pre-Big East games,
averaging 12.6 points and 4.8
rebounds off the bench.

Then the trouble started.

Brookin was found to be

. academically ineligible for the

second semester of the 1987-88
season and did not. play again
that year. It was revealed that he
needed to complete 11 credit
hours before the fall term to
become eligible again. Rumors
roared around the Pitt campus:
Brookin is transferring; he’s
taking the hardship route to the ’
NBA; he’ll be back. No one was
quite sure. . .

Except Brookin, that is. “There
was a lot of hearsay that I was
going to leave school, try and
go pro. I got tired of it,” he said.
“I just decided it was time to tell
people I was coming back to
school. I knew in my heart the
whole time what I was going to
do."

A year and a half later, Brookin
is still at Pitt, scheduled to start
tonight’stseason-opener against
Siena at small forward after
toiling away as the sixth man
and part—time starter last season.
Combatingaseason-longweight
problem, Brookin averaged 10.2
points and 3.1 rebounds and
scored a career-high 24 points

in a 99-91 upset of second—
ranked Oklahoma in 1988-89.
Brookin, now a senior,
observed a self—imposed silence
toward the press for the first half
of last season after he was
berated and ridiculed numerous
times for his weight, which Pitt
coach Paul Evans said reached
263 pounds at one point. Brookin
spent the past summer in the
weight room and added muscle
mass to his large frame. And he
has become much more candid
when talking about his past

proble-ms and future
considerations.
“I don’t care what people say

or write about me any more,” he
said. “The only person I have to
please is Coach Evans.”

He’s done that so far. In two 0

exhibition games, Brookin has
averaged 20 points and 6.5
rebounds and has made five of
seven three-point shots. He is
also shooting 87.5 percent from
the free-throw line.

“He realizes this is his last go-
round,” Evans said.

Brookin has benefited from
his weight—room work. While
he has been as adept as ever
from the perimeter, he has also
been going to the basket more,
which he says is intentional.

“I'm taking the ball to the hole
a lot more. I’m being more
physical and aggressive,”
Brookin said;

Evans‘ was. 7particularly . A

impressed with Brookin’s play
in the first half of the .108—89

victory over the Soviet Union at

the Civic Arena last Friday.

Brookin scored_ 16 first-half

points and was perfect from the

Hon-Tri.

field.

“Rod, I thought, shot super
the first half," Evans said, “but
he has to get a little more
consistent. In the second half,
he was not quite as offensive—
minded.”

"1 went into a little shell a little
bit in the second half," Brookin
said.

Jason Matthews, Pitt’s
shooting guard, said Brookin

' could be the strong point of the

team this year.

“He’s really been playing
hard,” Matthews said.

That’s a different sentiment
from the one his teammates
showed Brookin when he was

declared
sophomore.

“Rod has a few problems so I
just leave him alone,” Charles
Smith said at the time of the
incident. “I don’t have anything
to say _to him.” “Brookin
doesn't like the way his
rejuvenation has come about.
Injuries, academic failures and
poor eating habits should not
have to be corrected, he said.
They should never have
happened in the first place.

“I was given a second chance,”
Brookin said, “but the thing I try
to tell people is not to have a
second chance, to do it right the
first time.”

13

And if he had it to do all over
again, would he change
anything? Yes, he said. What
would be the first thing he would
change?

“My eating habits,” Brookin
said, a smile illuminating his
face. ’ ‘

Down to 230 pounds, Brookin
is serious about his career.

“The only thing I would
change is my discipline,” he
said. “I wasn’t real disciplined
coming out of high school. I

“But I got a second chance.”
Maybe starting over isn’t so
bad after all. '
