an Oakland bar, planning to go home.
Instead, they spent the night in jail.

Liberto and Hillwig said that their 13-
hour night in jail was not through any fault

that a police officer has a right to throw you
around for nothing,” said Liberto.

I According to Hillwig, he and Liberto
were standing near a friend’s car when a
man drove up in a red Grand Prix, put a
spotlight on them and asked if they had
any business in the area.

Hillwig said that the man didn’t show
him a badge or identify himself as a police
officer. "I thought he was a self—appointed
vigilante,” he said.

that he and his partner approached Liberto‘

a disturbance with the loud music coming
from their car.

Although Martine included in the police

“If the radio was playing too loud, that
was not our responsibility,” Hillwig said.

“Anyone can come up and say that they’re
a cop. We just walked away. He held a

Students prefer ISIS
despite some glitches’

By Jennifer Sikora
For T be Pitt News

All students at the University of
Pittsburghexpenence waiting and
waiting for one thing or another
at the beginning of each term.

This year, in an attempt to

decrease the amount of time
students spend waiting in lines,
the university has introduced a
new format for registering and for
the add/drop system.

The Integrated Student
Information System was designed
to make scheduling easier for both
students and staff. However,
many students are wondering if
ISIS has lived upto this promise.

Before ISIS, all the scheduling
for classes was done by hand.
According to ISIS coordinator
Susan Leary, a file containing cards
representing the number of seats
in each class was used to keep

for that class in the file. If there
was a card left, the student could
schedule the class.

All the information about
registration, courses and grades
for each student was ‘on file also,
according to Leary, who is also
the director of the College of Arts
and Sciences Records and
Information System. Now, she
said, everything is stored in the
computer.

Leary said, “I hear that people
are very pleased. ’I’

She added that delays in
scheduling and add/drop are
caused by the adjustment
everyone must make to use the
new system. Leary also said that
because ISIS is such a large and
frequently used system, problems
often occur. 3

and working with the ISIS
program must learn its “new

Rapes prompt precaution seminar

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staff Writer

It was a time for tough talk.

This was the attitude of the
assistant vice president for student
affairs, Dennis Donham, who
attended and participated in
Thursday’s Crime Watch seminar
in the William Pitt Union. The
seminar informed students of the
arrest of the suspect in the recent
South Oakland rapes and crime-

_ prevention tactics.

“This happened to us,” Donham
said. “There were four Pitt students
raped, and the person the police
caught was only charged with two.
It only takes simple mathematics
to know that this person is not the

only one [committing rapes in.

Oaklandl.”

His concern about further
attacks was echoed by Pitt public
safety director William Brennan,
who moderated the program.

Speakers included Brennan,
officer Dave McNutt of the zone-
six city—police station, Barbara
Weiner of Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape, Pat Scanlon of the
zone—six police security council
and Student Government Board
President Julie Shepard. Donham‘
and Cmdr. Carol Byrne of the
Pittsburgh Police’s community-
relations bureau joined the
speakers to answer questions
from the audience of
approximately 150 students and
other local residents.

Since entrance to the rape
victims’ apartments was gained
through open windows, McNutt
discussed apartment safety and
the need to secure windows and
doors safely.

“What we recommend is that
you put a dowel rod in the window
between the bottom sash and the
top sash, just to jam them together
to prevent lintrudersl from prying

air conditioning,” he said. “It’s
hot. It’s humid. [If you don’t have
air conditioning you can] talk tc
the maintenance person in your
building, or someone who’s
handy with their hands, and we
can pinastop your windows.”
McNutt said that a window can
be safely pin—stopped open six tc

eight inches, by inserting two nails‘
in the sash so that it allows air

circulation, yet prevents entry.
He warned the audience not tc

non—residents and recommended
that residents call ahead to their
roommates when they are
walking home at night, so their
roommates can notify police il

reasonable period of time.

Freeman may leave
Pitt before Posvar    

By Jennifer Calabrese
‘ News Editor '

Since Pitt President Wesley Posvar announced his retirement ‘
in May, the fates of Executive Vice President Jack Freeman and
athletic director Ed ,Bozik,'the men Posvar personally recruited
to be on his original administrative team, have been inquestion.

“I think that whoever succeeds me will be filling [Freeman's
and Bozik’sl jobs sometime within the next three to five years,”.
Posvar said in May. I S '

Now it appears that one of those men may be leaving before
Posvar does. Last week Freeman confirmed that he is afinalist
for an administrative job at Temple University. He also conﬁrmed
that he is being considered for a position at an undisclosed
university.

“Right now I do not think that this is a big deal. A lot of people
look at job opportunities elsewhere for all kinds of reasons," he
said. Freeman declined further comment and said that “When a
person accepts a job and decides to leave, that may be news, but
we are a far piece from that at this time. I have said all that I want
to say [...l until such time as it does or does not come to fruition"

Freeman left Pitt once before in 1986, when he was offered *a
job as president of the University of Maine but retumed less 
a month after leaving because of problems at that university. ‘

How to exercise your basic freedoms

By Mark Smith
sum‘ Writer

Editors note.- The following is
the first column in a series titled
“Know Your Rights, ” published
biweekly on Tuesdays in The Pitt
News. i

What happens if the police
arrest you? Do you know your
rights? Do you understand
Supreme Court decisions in
support of constitutional
protections, such as_ your right to
privacy?As a public service to our
readers, The Pitt News will begin
to run a biweekly series of articles
titled “Know Your Rights," to
answer important constitutional
questions.

With recent emphasis on the
Supreme Court and constitutional
rights, the “Know Your Rights”
column will answer basic
questions every citizen should
know.

Some individuals have argued

against “judicial activism” or_

“legislating from the bench.”

Conservatives in the White House
and political organizations have
accused the Supreme Court of the
1950s-70s of overextending its
inﬂuence beyond constitutional

However, even

court’s more
conservative period, from 1981 to
the present, the court has been

during the

very active and could be accused
of once again “legislating from
the bench.” _

Some individuals criticize the
court for being “conservative” or
“liberal.” This dimension is
simplistic when studying justices
and their opinions. For the
purposes of this series, individual
rights vs. the power of the
government will be the
touchstone for interpreting your
rights. In many instances,
“conservative” justices have
supported their “liberal”
counterparts in support of
individual rights. When important
Supreme Court cases affecting
your rights are mentioned in a
column, a quick synopsis of the
case will be presented for you to
interpret and judge.

The following articles will offer
“how—to-exercise-your-rights”
guidelines and keep you up-to-
date on the current state of your
freedoms. Everyday perceptions
of the rights of Americans may
not necessarily be reality.

In doing the research for this

series, I discovered that what I
learned in my high-school civics
and American-politics classes is
no longer the law of the land.

When reading this series, keep
in mind I am not a lawyer, and if
you want specifics, consult an
attorney. -

Americans claim to -live in a
country where the majority rules
and individuals are protected from
the majority by the Constitution.
In a democracy, citizens must be
informed about protecting their
freedom. Reading “Know Your
Rights” is a step toward preserving
your freedom.

As Norman Dorsen, former
president of the American Civil
Liberties Union, wrote, “Through
their exercise, rights are given life.
If they are rarely used, they may
be forgotten, and violations may
become routine.”

If you have a question about
your rights, send a letter to Mark
Smith, 434 William Pitt Union.
The Pitt News will publish
responses to as many of these
letters as possible.

Kuwaiti brothers feel effects of

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

Jasem and Ali Alhumoud’s
cousin was a young Iraqi who
didn’t want to serve in Saddam
Hussein’s army. So he cut off his
fingers, hoping that he would be
relieved from duty.

“He cut his ﬁngers so he could
not hold the gun‘ and shoot
because he did not want to fight.
They didn’t put him at home, of
course; they still put him in the
military uniform and [stationed]
him in the city as a guard,” said
Ali.

Jasem, 30, who is working on
getting his Ph.D. in engineering
from Pitt, and Ali, 23, a junior
industrial— engineering major, are
brothers from Kuwait. Although
Ali and Jasem’s parents, brothers
and sisters live in Kuwait, their
family is originally from Iraq, and
they still have many cousins and
other relatives there.

When the news of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait came, Jasem
was at home in his North Oakland
apartment watching television.

“A friend called and said that
Iraq had invaded. I thought he
was joking. I turned on [Cable
News Network], and I saw it on
the news. I was shocked," Jasem
said.

Before the invasion, Jasem and
Ali used to speak to their parents
every two weeks.

“As soon as I saw this on the
news, I tried to call home. And I
kept trying and trying, and now
they tell me that there are no more
lines, so I’ve stopped, ” Jasem said.

Though Ali and Jasem have not
been able to contact their parents,

The August 27th issue of The Pitt
News incorrectly advertised a
$4.99 pizza at Sorrentos Pizza. We
apologize for any inconvenience
this has caused Sorrentos and its
customers.

a friend whose brother escaped
from Kuwait last week has been
able to give them some
information about conditions in
the area.

“He said everything is very
expensive; there is a food
shortage, they are out of bread
and there are very long lines,” Ali
said.

“If before the invasion you had
$20 on you, then that is all you
have to last you because all of the
banks closed, and nobody goes
to work anymore,” he continued.

Ali and Jasem said they cannot
help but think the worst about
their parents’ situation.

“I think that they are living in
hunger right now. They probably
don’t have anything to eat," Ali
said. “Right now we do not even
know if they are alive.”

Ali and Jasem’s parents live in
Aljahra, a city very close to the
Iraqi border. Ali, who came to
the United States in 1986, has
vivid memories of living so close
to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq
conﬂict.

sounds of the bombing.

disappointed. Every year since we
came the embassy pays, and just
this one term they heard this news
and would not let us register,"
Jasem said.

Jasem contacted the embassy,
which agreed to pay the brothers’
tuition for one more semester.
Though the brothers still have
some personal funds now, Ali said
they could run out of money in a
couple of months.

Every summer since coming to
Pittsburgh, Ali and Jasem have
traveled to Kuwait. This summer,

their sister and her husband were ’

supposed to visit them, so they
cancelled their annual trip.

“We didn’t go because we were
expecting them. Otherwise, we
would have been in Kuwait when
this happened,” Jasem said.

we will do. Who knows how long
this will last?” Jasem said.

The U.S. involvement in the
Kuwait situation, according to Ali,
is both good and bad. \

“As Kuwaitis we feel that maybe
it is a good idea because [the
United States is] defending our
country and our land. But as
Muslims and Arabs, we don’t think
that it is a good idea. If they came
just for their interests, just for their
oil, then it is not right,” he said.

“I think that America scared
Saddam, but he will wait about a
year to withdraw so that it does
not look like a defeat.”

For now, Ali andjasem continue
to wait for news. For support,
they meet with a group of Kuwaiti
students from the Community
College of Allegheny County
every week.

“We meet to discuss what

Shuttle service extended into SouthOakland Semina

A combined effort by Pitt’s
department of public safety and
the Student Govern—ment Board
has allowed the campus shuttle
to extend its service into South
Oakland. Beginning today, the
shuttle will run Sunday through
Thursday from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
and Friday and Sat-urday from 8
p.m. to 3 a.m.

SGB President Julie Shepard
said, “We still have a lot of students
living in South Oakland. With the
[recent] rapes, I think it’s even
more important [to have the
shuttle].

“You need to think about what
you can do to get through
[potentially unsafe] areas as safely
as possible,” she said. “Please try
and use the services available to
you."

The South Oakland shuttle will
run for a six-week trial period,
when it will be determined if the
service is necessary.

“If you feel that someone is

following you, turn around and
lookthat person in the eye,” she

said. “If you feel comfortable
turning around and screaming [at

someone following you] and saying J,

for what happens to him or her,
especially in the case of a rape,”

said Scanlon, a 48-year South

Community Security Council. She

also said that it was time for student "3

residents to take more
responsibility for their actions

which affect the community.
“Call me up and we’ll take a ride
through Oakland, and I’ll show you

security doors propped open,

windows on the first floor wide

open, everyone walking around in
their undies with their windows
open, hanging out windows

hollering at each other. You don’t
know who’s out there; you don’t
know who’s coming to one of your
parties. You’re not discriminatory,”
she said.

Scanlon doesn’t want the resident

students to become so concerned
with crime that they stop having
fun, but she wishes that they would
take the time to think a little more

about security and personal safety. ‘.7

“Use [your] noodle because it’s

going to save your life, maybe, one

day. You can’t walk around in

Shepard talked about the efforts
student government is making to
address street safety, including the

SGB taxi service and the new South

Oakland shuttle service.
Byrne used a portion of the
question-and-answer period to

express his concern for the safety

and continued safety of students.

“Let me ask you all a question,”
he said. “Had an apprehension not
been made in those rapes, how
many empty seats would there be

here tonight?”

Byrne spoke of the need to be
constantly vigilant, even to the point

of mild paranoia, about one’s

personal safety and about anything

suspicious happening in the
community.

“How many people were looking

According to Hillwig, Martine
then walked back to his car put a
small siren on his hood for a
minute and then removed it again.

Liberto and Hillwig turned left
from Filmore onto Craig. Martine
then came up to them again and
told them to leave. At that point
the police car, which was behind
them, pulled in front of them and
blocked their path.

Both Liberto and Hillwig said
that Martine then threw Liberto
against the unmarked car several
times. According to Liberto, he
told Martine he was suffering from
a previous back injury, but Martine
threw him against the car again
and said, “Your back and neck is
going to hurt by the time I get
donewith you."

Liberto went to his doctor after
the incident and was told that he
had sustained further injuries to
his back. “I don’t know yet how
bad it is, but my doctor said that it
is deﬁnitely worse,” Liberto said.
Repeated attempts to contact
Martine about this allegation were
unsuccessful.

Hillwig and Liberto were then
arrested and taken to the station.

“We weren’t even told what we
were being charged with until the
next day,” Hillwig said.

At a hearing on Friday where
Liberto and Hillwig were facing
charges of resisting arrest and
disorderly conduct, Martine had a
different account of the evening.

Martine said that he approached
Hillwig and Liberto because their
car radio was blasting. He asked
them if they had any business in
the area. According to Martine,
Liberto said, “no fucking
business." Both Liberto and
Hillwig denied using profanity.

Profanity under Pittsburgh law
constitutes disorderly conduct. At
the hearing, Martine admitted that
he had used profanities, but said
that both Liberto and Hillwi g were
also using profanity. After the
hearing, Martine denied using
profanities.

Martine said that Liberto and
Hillwig walked away, but then
went to another car. Hillwig said
that a second car was never
involved. “The one thing that
[Martine] said that was a total lie
was the second car,” Hillwig said.

After the charges of resisting
arrest were dropped and Hillwig
and Liberto were convicted of
disorderly conduct, Martine
explained why he had arrested
them.

“They were arrested for

previous noise plus yelling back _

at me,” he said.

Martine said at the trial that he
had assumed that the car belonged
to Liberto and Hillwig, but that if
he had known it wasn't their car,
“I. still would have stopped them
and asked them if they had
business in the area. There would
be nothing I could do about it.
They have a right to be there.”

Martine said that at one point
Liberto pointed out that Martine
had no way of knowing that
Hillwig and Liberto are gay. “The
one guy [Liberto] said to me, ‘I
had a wife and a kid,’ and I said,
‘that’s probably why she left you.’
I probably shouldn't have said
that,” Martine said.

Martine said that the reason that
he asks people in the area whether
they have business there is
because of the problem of gay
i. r.rz.‘~1:H,’7 zrrmmd Craig 93????

“People who live there have
their rights These [gay] people
claim that they have rights, but
[Craig residents] have a right to
sleep," he said.

“[Gays] come out and they are
urinating on their porch and
committing sex acts out there."

But according to Joy Fuqua,
member of Cry Outl, “Cry Out!
has been monitoring the situation
in [that] area for nearly two years
and to our knowledge the police
have never arrested anyone for
having sex on Craig Street or for
urinating there.”

Hillwig and Liberto plan to
appeal the summary offense
conviction of disorderly conduct,
which carries a $100 ﬁne. Sam
Hens-Greco, Hillwig and Liberto’s
attorney, said that the reason his
clients were convicted was for
using obscenities.

“lThe magistrate] said this was a
question of credibility between

the police officer and my clients,”
Hens-Greco said.

“They want to light this thing.
They want it dismissed and
rightfully so,” he said “They were
thrown in jail. I mean, that’s the
thing, that’s the really outrageous
thing [...l because [usually] with a
disorderly conduct charge you’re
not going to spend any time in
jail,” he said.

Hens-Greco said there was no
reason for Hillwig and Liberto to
be charged with resisting arrest.

“lAt trial, Martine said], ‘They
didn’t run away, they didn’t swing,
they didn’t hit me.’ I mean, they
didn’t resist,” he said.

Hens-Greco explained why
Hillwig and Liberto were
convicted at the hearing, instead
the matter going to trial.

“That [was] a preliminary
hearing. That’s a determination

magistrate] dismissed the cases
for [resisting arrest], it became a
summary offense trial,” he said.

Suspects charged with a
summary offense get a hearing in
front of a magistrate instead of a
jury trial, he said.

“Then you have the right to
appeal that matter and that’s what
they’re going to do. At that trial
[...] I would be surprised if this
police officer shows up, to tell
you the truth. And what will
happen is the case will be
dismissed,” Hens-Greco said.

“There’s a whole different
question of whether or not there
will be a civil action [because of
possible injury to Liberto’s backl,”

Hens-Greco said.

Liberto and Hillwig said that
gays who are convicted of
disorderly conduct are caught in
the dilemma of whether or not to
pay attorneys’ fees fighting the
charges, or to pay the fine for
charges that they consider unfair.

“I know that if I would have
paid the fine it would have been
another case just thrown away. It
would have just been all hush-
hush and they would have gotten
away with things. I would rather
pay the lawyer’s fees and try to
get some rights down the road,”
Liberto said.

The students scheduling
classes, however, have mixed
feeling about this change.

During summer advising
sessions, scheduling took up to
two hours for many freshmen.
Delays and setbacks made it
difficult for advisers to schedule
quickly. Lines are now forming
for add/drop, too.

“I was there for two hours
[waiting] to drop la class]. It was
amazing how many people were
there,” said freshman Jon Heer,
who recently went through the
add/ drop process for the first time.

Returning students, however,
have noticed a difference with

ISIS.

Senior Chuck Husa remarked
that scheduling is “a nightmare
I’d rather forget” but said that the
new system seems better, overall.

“The lines are shorter; it’s a lot
different,” said senior Chrissy
Novak. She said that the new
forms are easier to read, and they
provide better methods to set up
a schedule. Novak also added that
ISIS “is more efficient and more
up-to-date.”

Leary summarized the new ISIS
program: ‘‘[It is} a vast
improvement, and it will get
better.”

Ballroom dancing may come to Pitt

By Andrea Barczykowski
Stajf Writer

Ballroom dancing is not just for
grandma and grandpa anymore.

This style of dance has recently
gained popularity among all ages
and is making its way to Pitt.

Adele Stark, a physical-
education graduate of Pitt and
the coordinator of the ballroom-
dancing organization at
Community College of Allegheny
County, is very interested in
forming a ballroom-dancing club
for Pitt students.

“lstudentsl think it’s just for old
people, but it isn't. It’s for people
of all ages,” Stark said.

According to Stark, there are
many reasons to get involved with
ballroom dancing.

“It’s a fine thing to do [with
other people]; it’s joyous, it’s done
to music and it’s good aerobic
exercise,” she said.

Many colleges, including Penn
State, not only have clubs, but
also give Credit for classes in
ballroom dancing. Brigham

-Young University has over 1,000

students participating in its dance
club and offers a’ degree in

ballroom dancing.

Another reason behind the
newfound popularity of ballroom
dancing is that you don’t have to
be another Fred Astaire to
participate. I

“You don’t have to be a ballet
dancer. It’s perfect for a young
[student] who wants to dance but
doesn’t know how. It’s just a large
group of students having fun,”
Stark said.

Mary Kellner, the instructor for
the Carnegie Mellon University
ballroom-dancing club, will also
be the instructor at Pitt if the group
is organized.

According to Kellner, the
interest in ballroom dancing has
been increasing.

“[Ballroom dancing] is a
growing thing. Pittsburgh is one
of the last places to get into this,”
Kellner said.

This is the second year CMU
has had a club, and anywhere
between 90 and 120 students
attend the classes, according to
Kellner. The dancing team will

also be competing in an
international competition in
England this year.

The beginners’ course includes
four basic dances: fox-trot, swing,
cha—cha and waltz.

“Fox—trot and waltz are what
we call smooth dances. They are 3‘
very elegant and are designed to
travel around the floor. Swing
and cha—cha are rhythm or Latin
dances; they’re fast [and] bouncy,”
said Kellner.

Kellner believes that ballroom
dancing would be a good
opportunity for Pitt students.

“It’s a good social outlet; you I
get to meet good people, and it’s
healthy. If you stay with it, you
can keep it with you for years,”
she said.

“It’s good for the mind, the soul
and the body,” she said.

Because of the great number
of students at Pitt, Kellner sees a
lot of potential for a successful
ballroom- dancing club. ,3

The cost of the class is $25 for
a 12-week course.

cartoonist for ’lI‘Ih1ce Pitt News. Just think, you could be the
next Todd Condron.

Self-serving and protected. ..

The Constitution and its amendments guarantee all
people protection of their rights. Last week, however, a
Pittsburgh Police officer decided that sexual preference
better determines the extent to which those rights are
upheld. ’

Mark Liberto and Larry Hillwig were standing‘ by a

- friend’s car on South Craig Street when Sgt. Richard Martine
drove past them in an unmarked police car. Martine,

stopped and asked the men if they had any business in the
area. Martine then proceeded to badger Liberto and Hillwig
with bbsteiiitiesz Hillwig and Liberto then walked away,
but Martine continued after them. i
Martine claimed that although he did use obscenities,

/Liberto used them as well, a charge both Liberto and

Hillwig deny. ,

When the two men tried to leave, Martine’s police car
swerved in front of them, blocking their hope of leaving
peacefully. Liberto and Hillwig said Martine then exited
his vehicle and threw Liberto against the unmarked vehicle,
ignoring Liberto’s pleas for mercy for a previously-injured
back. A doctor said that Liberto reinjured his back in the
incident and has said that he is willing to testify to that

-effect if Liberto decides to launch a civil suit against

Martine.

Yet somehow, Liberto and Hillwig were charged with
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest the next day. In the
meantime, both men spent 13 hours in the county jail.

During this incident, Martine never identified himself as
a police officer. He failed to show either man a badge.
Only when he placed a police light on his car did Liberto
and Hillwig realize that he was an officer of the law.

When he was under oath, Martine admitted that neither
man attempted to strike him nor run away. This means that
the charge of resisting arrest was just a fabrication. This
action by Martine is no less than blatant harassment.

Unfortunately, Martine probably will not be punished
for his actions. Under the city’s new Gay Rights Ordinance,
the city is virtually powerless to punish him.

Martine would first face a hearing in front of a select
committee of three officers, chosen by the city. If they
found sufficient grounds for further investigation, then
they would hand the case over to the city’s Human Relations
Board. And if they discovered an infraction had taken
place, then they would, in turn, ask a state commission to
investigate. Finally, after going through those buffers, the
state of Pennsylvania could press charges against Martine.

It is unfortunate that “to serve and protect” was interpreted
by one officer to mean his own personal sense of morality.

Advertising dollars spent for rape

Every day, every hour, women
and girls are being raped, insulted
and degraded legally, and we
shell out the money that pays for
it — it’s called advertising, and
it’s everywhere. Television and
magazines exist for one purpose:
to deliver audiences to advertisers.
Advertisers in turn sell values like
normalcy, sexuality and
romanticism, and both advertisers
and critics agree that advertising
is essentially: -

- propaganda promoting Am-
erican values

0 teaching that happiness can be
bought .

0 teaching that we are consumers
0 exploitive

- teaching us that products will
fulﬁll us

0 dependent upon our anxiety
and insecurity.

Billboards, commercials and
magazine ads are the real
educators, teaching us to consume

‘a billion dollars a year for

advertising that we spend half
our lives absorbing

’‘I’d probably never have been
married if I had not lost 49
pounds.”

In advertising, fat women are
portrayedonly as buffoons. In
the above quote from an
advertisement for a diet program,
the woman describes how only
by shedding her excess weight
was she worthy of a man's love.
Overweight women are taught
that they are both unlovable and
undesirable. Since we are taught
that finding true love is our first
priority, fat becomes a hated
enemy in our quest for happiness.
It is no wonder then that we
become insecure when we look
at ourselves —-— 80 percent of all
women believe that they are
overweight. In a recent Doritos
commercial, pre-teens talk about
how women’s lives go downhill
after 30 — they can’t wear cool
clothes or date cool guys because
they are too old, fat and
undesirable. The commercial’s
message is that since they are
eating “Doritos Light,” these

young girls will never have that
problem. This commercial
accurately reflects young girls’
preoccupation with body image-
— 80 percent of fourth-grade
girls polled said they were
currently dieting.
“ . . because innocence is sexier
tban you think”
Advertisements referring to or
using little girls in a sexually
provocative manner are both the
saddest and the most infuriating
of the degrading ads that we
absorb daily. One ad featured a
5-year-old girl with bottles
(shaped symbolically like “jugs”)
against her bare chest. Featured
recently in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette was Christian Dior’s new
line of lacy, silk “bralettes” and
panties targeted specifically for
4-year-old girls. By targeting this
kind of product to 4-year-old

Lisa
Oshop

children, the designer would have
you think that little girls are willing
and wanting to appear as
seductive as their 20-year-old
counterparts, and that grown
women want to resemble young
girls. A few weeks ago, I was
ﬂicking through the channels on
television, and Phil Donahue was
staging a lingerie fashion show,
during which a model came
skipping out wearing a “baby
doll” nightie, chewing gum and
holding a teddy bear. The
narrator, or whoever it is who
describes the clothes that models
wear, exhorted women in the
audience to buy the featured
nightwear and to show their
husbands their “innocent side.
Don’t be afraid to be a little girl.”
No, be afraid to be a little girl,
especially in Wisconsin, where a
judge ruled that a 5-year-old girl,
a victim in a child-molestation.
case, was “unusually pro-
miscuous,” and the defendant
could not be held accountable

for his actions. Thank heaven for
little girls, indeed.

“Size bas notbtng to do witb
performance. ”

"I don ’t judge my cigarette by
its lengtb.”

Men are taught to always be
powerful, invulnerable and in
control. Focusing on men’s fears
that the opposite of these
messages are true, the ads
reassure and paradoxically
reinforce men’s fears as
advertisers pitch their products.
In many of these ads, the
definition of invulnerability
involves humiliating and/or
hurting women.

Advertisements from Esprit
featured a man ironing the pelvis
of a woman stretched out on an
ironing board. Most
advertisements feature females
as the male’s prey, something to
be hunted or conquered. Women
in advertisements are made both
partner and victim in humiliation
like the Esprit ad, or violence,
like the infamous Chanelads that
feature the mysterious stranger’s
shadow hanging over a woman
who is shading her eyes from and
“blinded” by the sun. By
exaggerating and reassuring the
fears of men through advertisers’
use of violence against women,
society becomes desensitized to
the realities of rape, child
molestation and other brutalities.
. Sure, some readers will argue
against my point, saying that “it’s
just advertising; no one takes it
seriously.” If you need more
proof, look in the mirror, and
think again, as you take in the
shirt that you bought because a
big designer or athletic company’s
logo is emblazoned across the
chest. Ask yourself why you
bought the pants, skirt or shoes
you are wearing, or the cosmetics
that you are using. Ask yourself
in whose interests it really is that
you buy what you buy, and think
again whether advertising doesn’t
influence everything that you'do.

Warm up...

Pitt reserves see

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Backup players live for these
kinds of games.

After a team runs up the score
and the starters are taken out, the
relief platoons come in, dying to
take their cracks against an
overmatched team.

Derrick Lewis and Glenn
Deveaux were among 41 reserves
used in last Saturday’s 55-5
drubbing of Ohio University.

Head coach Paul Hackett said
he would use 16 to 18 starters
throughout the year on both
defense and offense, but there
probably won’t be too many more
games like Ohio U. for these
backups, where they can play half
the game.

Lewis and Deveaux entered the
season listed as backups to Curvin
Richards and Ronald Redmon at
the tail and fullback positions,
respectively, but they were able
to strut their stuff against the
hapless Bobcats after Richards did
most of the damage early (99 yards
rushing in the first quarter).

Deveaux carried 10 times for 59
yards and one touchdown, while
Lewis added 49 yards of his own
on nine carries and scored twice.

Deveaux’s TD came on a 25-
yard scamper in the second
quarter, capping a six-play drive,
four of which were rushes by the
junior from Cocoa, Fla.

His 59 yards tied his total for the
entire 1988 season and easily beat,
heck, even his TD run beat the 15
rushing yards he had last year.

As the fourth tailback last year,
he wasn’t even listed in the 1989

Richards, Adam Walker and Ricky

_ Turner. He did, however, become

Steelers offensive coordinator
Joe Walton’s intricate system is
designed to give the opposing
defense fits, although in 1990 it’s
seems
confused by the game plan.

Saturday night, however,
coupled with a simpler set of play
calls and the return of running
back Tim Worley, the Steelers
outlasted the Philadelphia Eagles
20-10. A

The 52,105 on hand were
shown a more streamlined team
than in previous weeks. Problems
persisted, however, among them
a few dropped balls, a lack of
consistent play by the offense,
three missed field goals and a
secondary that got burned a
couple of times by Eagle
quarterback Randall
Cunningham.

Despite those problems, the

injury.

But that was last year. Walker is
gone now, and Turner has
switched to ﬂanker, leaving
Deveaux, a junior, as the only
other experienced tailback to
spell Richards.

“My main concern is just
contributing. I’m running behind
Curvin Richards, so it’s not like

performance was better than the
Steelers’ 20-9 loss to the Cowboys
last week. Enough so to make
Coach Chuck Noll happy: “It was
obviously a better effort,
offensively and defensively. It was
the kind of game we needed at

this point. I thought our special _

teams were excellent, aggressive;
[they] tried to make things
happen.”

The defense handled the
explosive Cunningham for most
of the game, although early it
looked like he was going to have
an easy time dropping bombs into
the Steelers’ secondary.

After linebacker Greg Lloyd
dumped the Eagles’ running back
Keith Byars for a 1—yard loss,
Cunningham hurled a 58-yard
completion to receiver Mike
Quick, who blew right past
defensive back Delton Hall.

The defense held Philadelphia
on third and one, and the Eagles
settled for a 27-yard Roger Ru zek

I’m running behind a mediocre
back. I’m running behind one of
the best in the country," said
Deveaux. “Mentally, you have to
be in the right frame of mind [to
be a backup]. It’s tough to come
into the game cold. Idon’t have it
as tough though, because I play a
lot of special teams too.

field goal.

The Steelers were able to poke
the ball into the end zone halfway
through the second quarter as
quarterback Bubby Brister threw
three times to Louis Lipps,
including an 18-yard bootleg on
the right sideline for the score.
Pittsburgh added a 25—Y1lrd field
goal to go up 10-5 at the half.

The Steelers had a chance to go
up by two touchdowns, but
Worley dropped a pass in the end
zone on the third down, and when
punter and holder Dan Stryzinski
bobbled the snap, Gary
Anderson’s 24-yard kick hooked
right for no score.

“That was an easy play there. I
was wide open. I just dropped
the ball. Ifit was hard, I probably
would have caught it," Worley
said.

Worley, who returned to the
lineup after having arthroscopic
knee surgery, rushed 15 times for

sense. That may sound real crazy,
but there’s not as much pressure
on me. People don't expect as
much from me as they do from
Curvin,” Deveaux said.

Hackett said that Deveaux did a
solid job “taking the heat off of
Curvin” against Ohio.

The same may be said for Iewis.

Despite Super Bowl massacres, Broncos still /eings of AFC West _

Remember when Dan Fouts
would lead the Chargers to garne-
winning touchdowns in the ﬁnal
two minutes? Remember when
Marcus Allen was setting rushing
records with the Raiders?
Remember when opposing teams
could not beat the Seahawks in
the Kingdome? You have a good
memory. These events were
regular occurrences in the mid-
’80s. That was when the AFC West
was the best division in the NFL.
Now everyone is trying to surpass
Denver so the Broncos don’t reach

V the Super Bowl and embarrass

the entire AFC again.

DENVER BRONCOS: The
Broncos gambled and won last
season. No, owner Pat Bowlen
did not take the 49ers minus the
points in the Super Bowl. They
gambled by taking Bobby
Humphrey in last year’s

supplemental draft. Many teams
stayed away from Humphrey
because he injured his feet at
Alabama. Humphrey showed that
his feet were ﬁne as he rushed for
1,151 yards during his rookie
campaign.

On defense, the Broncos are
once again shufﬂing the cards by
changing some players’ positions.
No one will have to guess where
Karl Mecklenburg is going to line
up for each play this year. He is
slated to start at left outside
linebacker where he can chase
down weak side runs, cover the
tight end and blitz from the
outside. ROLB Simon Fletcher is
the team’s best pass rusher.

The Broncos could use an
every-down defensive end with
superior pass-rushing skills, but
then again, who couldn’t7 Greg
Kragen is a solid nose tackle. As

for the secondary, forget the Super
Bowl; Dennis Smith and Steve
Atwater are the best pair of safeties
in football.

John Elway will bounce back
from Super Bowl XXIV. The

Michael
Milliron

Broncos will depend less on
Elway’s impromptu big plays and
more on a newly developed
intermediate passing scheme.
Elway has the kind of gun to get
the ball to his skill people quickly,
enabling them to do something
with it after the catch. “Amigos”
Mark Jackson and Ricky Nattiel
need to be more consistent and
avoid injury to help the improved

the situational backs to go with

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS:
Derrick Thomas had an amazing
rookie year and looks to be among
the league leaders in sacks for
seasons to come. He registered 10
sacks last season and is one of the
key players in the Chiefs’
rejuvenated defense.

The Chiefs possess the best
three-man defensive line in the
league. When Thomas rushes the
passer along with linemen Neil
Smith, Dan Saleaumua and Bill
Maas, the Chiefs will have a pass
rush rivaling that of the Vikings
and Eagles.

With safeties Deron Cherry and
Lloyd Burruss, the Chiefs have the
best defense in the AFC and maybe
the NFL. -

Christian Okoye led the NF
with 1,480 rushing yards on a
league-high 370 carries. He is a
physical phenom that weighs 260
pounds and runs a 4.5/40. Okoye
will bang away behind a titanic
offensive line that averages about

295 pounds a man.

Steve DeBerg, the apparent
starter at QB, is a fine backup but
does not have the arm strength to
complete a lot of the passes that
he attempts. WR Stephone Paige
has lost a step and is no longer the
deep threat he once was.
Journeyman Pete Mandley looks
to start opposite Paige.

SAN DIEGO CHARGERS: A
telltale sign that the ’90s have
begun is in San Diego. The
Chargers no longer win by

outscoring their opponents but ,

by smothering them under a wave
of defensive pass rushers. Pro-
bowler Lee Williams leads an
impressive defensive line. The
1989 'first—round pick Burt
Grossman had a fine rookie year
at RE, recording 10 sacks.

Leslie O’Neal came back from a
severe knee injury last season to
have 12 and a half sacks. The
Chargers selected USC’s Junior
Seau in the first round. After a
lengthy holdout, he is expected
to win a job at LILB

pile of 10 other Panthers hovering
over Howell. And this was long
after the play was blown dead.

“Coach vonAppen has said from
the beginning that we want to
have as many starters and as many
players on defense as we possibly
can,” head coach Paul Hackett
said. “There is no way you can
play at the intensity level that we’re
interested in demanding from our
defensive team if 12 or 13 guys
play the whole game. ..

football. It doesn’t matter who
they are, what name tl1ey’ve got
 they’re in blue; they’ve got a
helmet on that says ‘Pitt,’ and
they’re ﬂying to the football. That’s
the way we’re going to play
defense. Anybody that will do
that will find a place and an
opportunity to play on this football
team,” Hackett said.

The idea of the whole team
flying to the football originated at
Panther training camp in
Johnstown just a scant month ago.
During any defensive drill, all
players on the ﬁeld were expected

player failed to do that, the whole
team had to execute the drill over
again. And perhaps the guilty party
(parties) would run a lap or two.

Indeed, the pace of practices in
Johnstown was hectic, to say the
least. ButvonAppen seems to have

gotten his point across, for his

team bolted to the football on

every play this past weekend.
“Coach vonAppen lives and dies

by that. I don’t care if you’re a

marquee player or not; if you don’t

run to the ball, you won't play,”

With Redmon out because of
injury, Lewis came in and
performed well, before being
relieved by junior Lance Markel.

In contrast to Deveaux, Lewis
was thitust into the Panthers’
offense almost immediately last
year as a redshirt freshman. He
was listed as a backup to Redmon
in the 1989 media guide but
actually out-rushed (156 yards to
152) and out-started (six games
to three) Redmon.

Redmon is listed as the starter
again this year, but it was Lewis
who got the starting call against
Ohio due to Redmon’s injury.

“I know Ronald is the starter,”
said Lewis. “He’s a very consistent
performer when he’s in there. He’s
like a coach on the field to me. It’s
more'li-ke we sharethe position. I
block and run the ball on short
yardage situations, while Ronald
is good at catching the ball and is
quicker.”

Lewis speaks the truth. Redmon
was the Panthers’ second leading
receiver last year and both his
TDs were via air mail. Last year,
Lewis scored his three TDs all on
the ground, smashing in from two,
five and four yards out. His two
scores against Ohio were from
one and two yards.

Lewis’ touchdowns on Saturday
came in what he called a “tank”
formation, where he is the tank.
At 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds, that's
a fitting description. Redmon is
expected back this week, and
Lewis’ playing time will likely be
diminished somewhat, but that is
something he can’t control and
doesn’t even worry about.

Backupior role players live by
the moment, never knowing
when, for how long or even if
they will play. This leaves them
little recourse but to keep one
philosophy about football.

54 yards.

Brister was pleased that his team
was able to get on track. “We
were able to move the ball and
score some points. I know our
defense gave us some good
positions. I think at the end of the
game the other guys were tired
on the other side of the ball, and
we were still coming off the ball
and playing pretty good. I feel
good that we’re getting better,
and we played a pretty damn good
team.”

In the second half, Pittsburgh’s
defense held the Eagles’ running
game to eight yards, yielding only
45 for the entire game.

The lone Eagle TD was another
Cunningham bomb past Dwayne
Woodruff to Fred Barnett for 55
yards.

Worley added, “It’s not that the
guys don’t know the plays. We
switched to the basic game today,
and it worked well.”

Noll summed up Worley’s
return: “He runs hard. He
continues to go and block. He
had an outstanding block on a
short—yardage situation. I think
we still have a ways to go.”

Another Anderson field goal
and a 5-yard touchdown run by
Warren Williams preserved the
win for Pittsburgh.

“The biggest thing wasthe lack
of errors. The execution was good.
We knew what we were doing,”
Noll said.

the starter for 1990. He had two
500—yard passing games at the end
of the season. Anthony Miller
could be the conference’s best
receiver. He had 75 receptions for
1,252 yards and 10 TDs last year.
Watch out for third-rounder
Walter Wilson out of East Carolina.
He has good deep speed.
Quarterback experience is a
concern. Jim McMahon was
released and picked up by the
Eagles. Tolliver, Mark Vlasic and
John Friesz have a total of three
years experience between them.

LOS ANGELES RAIDERS:
OwnerAl Davis was recently seen
at a Don Henley concert at the
Forum. Davis was heard singing
this line from “Boys of Summer”
along with Henley:  .. those days
are gone forever; I should just let
‘em go, but ...” Seriously though,
Davis cannot talk about the
Raiders without harping on the
past. “The Raiders’ greatness ..
the winningest organization in all
of sports  our great players,
Stabler, Biletnikoff, Tatum ...”
Come on Al, what about the 1990
Raiders? Well, maybe there is a
good reason Davis is so
preoccupied with the past.

The Raiders do possess a high-
octane offense. They have an
incredible amount of speed at
wide receiver with burners Willie
Gault, Mervyn Fernandez and Tim
Brown. QB Jay Schroeder is
expected to start due mainly to
Steve Beuerlein’s holdout.

Bo knows football, and Bo
knows baseball, but does Bo

know consistency? He usually‘

arrives around week six or seven

9 of the season, has a few 100—yard

games and then disappears with
a few nicks and bruises. A few
great runs on a highlight ﬁlm do
not win football games. Marcus
Allen, like Eric Dickerson, appears
disgruntled. Davis has been
exploring trades for Allen.

Largent and Curt Warner are gone,

the Kingdome. Teams have

Defense —

Continued from page 11
Richard Allen.

“There’s nothing more
intimidating than 11 guys staring

down at a running back when _

he's on his back, with all of us
hovering over him,” he added.

This type of defensive strategy
is a first at Pitt, according to Allen,
and the players are sold on it,
thanks to vonAppen.

Aside from the intimidation
factor, this tactic implies a1l—out
hustle. A few times this past
Saturday, the officials were
attempting to mark the ball on a
new line of scrimmage after a
runner was brought down, and
they had to deal with numerous
Pitt defenders still sprinting to the
site of the tackle from various
points on the field.

VonAppen has ingrained this
strategy as a prerequisite for his
athletes to even play in a football
game. If you don't do it, you're
out. End of story.

discovered how to win there. After
this season, head coach Chuck
Knox may be gone.

The Seattle Seahawks are
supposed to use the run-and-
shoot as well as a one—back
offense much of the time this
season. Dave Krieg has had a
roller-coaster career and figures
to have problems executing this
type of offense. This system
requires quick reads of both the
defense and the routes the
receivers will run, things Krieg
does not do very well. Handing
off to Warner and looking for
Largent was more his speed.

The Seahawks got enormous
help on defense in the ’9O draft.
DT Cortez Kennedy, OLB Terry
Wooden and S Robert Blackmon
will all challenge for starting jobs
this season. ‘Kennedy is the key to
the Seahawks’ using a 4—3 defense
this year. He andJoe Nash should
be the tackles With Jacob Green
and Jeff Bryant at the ends.
