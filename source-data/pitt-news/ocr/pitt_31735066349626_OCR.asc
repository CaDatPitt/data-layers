“SCATH AIIotedFunds
 Graduate Students

BY RICH HARRY

Financial endorsement of the
Student Coalition Against Tuition
Hikes (SCATH) by the Faculty of
Arts and.Science-Graduate Student

Organization (FAS-GSO) was ap- ‘

proved Friday at a FAS-GSO
meeting.

. FAS-GSO members voted unani-

. A ’ ously to appropiate $250 of the

IQ

group's funds to SCATH.

The request for the endorse-
mciit, made by FAS-GSO and
SCATH member Steven Weiner,
stemmed from SCATH’s attempts
to net funding for projects aimed at
-stopping a pending tuition in-
crease.

SCATH needs the money to
cover general expenses, including
the cost of paper used for
questionaires to be distributed in
classes and dormitories, according
to Weiner. .

Weiner, a graduate student in
the history department, was
elected at the meeting to represent
FAS graduates in SCATH discus-
sions. He said the money also
would fund publicity of future
SCATH meetings and information-
al mailings concerning SCATH and

tuition hikes to all students during .

the summer.

FAS-GSO members, represent-
ing graduates in each FAS
department, approved the request
in order to demonstrate the concern
of the entire graduate student
body.

“I think this organization repre-

asents graduate students as a whole

-£‘*

‘us... --'

 

and there's an extreme need to
make a statement on the question
of tuition,” FAS-GSO member Bob
Nelson ‘said.

While agreeing FAS-GSO should
support any effort to prevent a
tuition increase, some members
indicated graduate students would
be paying proportionately higher
shares than would other schools.

“The only qualm I have is why
GSO should support something
that’s primarily aimed towards

   
  

  

 

t fflnth

   

Due campus pliceman claimed Friday nit the

    

undergraduates?” asked one FAS-
GSO member. “Purely by num-
bers, undergraduates way outnum-
ber gradutates." I

Also, as part of the motion to
approve SCATH’s funding request,
FAS-GSO members said SCATH
should ask all graduates schools
and student organizations to
allocate money in a coordinated
effort to ﬁght the tuition hike.

Administrator’ Warns  

Hosti|eTactics Hurt Cause

BY CRIS HALL

Student demands for corporate.’

funding of higher education may be
counter~productive, according to
Director S‘ of Development and
Alumni Affairs Bernard Koperek.
“If students go to local corpora-
tions asking for ﬁnancial support of

the University, I hope they won't

go about it in a hostile manner,”
Koperek said. “All that would do
would be alienate people who have
supported us in the past. '

r

‘eye toward’ demanding

Koperek said he was disturbed
by a recent attack launched by
students against several corpora-

tions headquartered in Pittsburgh. ,

He said several students have
called his office seeking informa-
tion about those companies ‘with an
‘those
corporations increase or re-direct
their ﬁnancial support of the

University in an effort to hold down"

tuition.

Zarb Pushes Energy Autonomy

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Energy independence for the
United States can be ‘achieved by
1985, chief Federal Energy Admin-
istrator Frank Zarb said Friday.

“We’ll be embargo-proof if we
practice maximumi conservation,
maximize oil‘ and gas development,
double our coal production and
expand the light water’ nuclear
breeder reactor program,” Zarb
said at a press conference in the
Webster Hall Hotel.

The United States has made a

beginning toward energy conserva-
tion and current decreases in
consumption are _due to conserva-
tion rather than increased devel-
opment of other energy resources,
according to Zarb.

Zarb attributed current energy
difficulties to lack of foresight
during the ’60s.

This country sold out to cheap oil
in 1961, according to Zarb. “We
neglected the coal industry and
didn’t pay attention to the question
of nuclear energy that should have
been dealt with in 1965.”

Zarb said the development of the
country's natural gas resources will
enable more control over prices.

Transportation is one of the
pr‘ ary difficulties with coal
pro uction, Zarb said_. “We have
to be able to move coal from where
it’s mined to where it’s needed.”

Chief Federal Energy Administrator Frank Zarb said Friday the
United States could be self-sufficient and embargo-proof by 1985.

For example, Zarb explained

'there is a problem in moving coal

from Wyoming to Texas. ‘Accord-
ing to Zarb, the railroads have to be
improved or transportation such‘ as
a pipeline to ﬂoat the coal along in
water must be developed.

Zarb said there is no easy
solution to transportation difﬁcul-
ties. “There are interest groups on
both sides and these are tough
“issues.”

Zarb said nuclear and coal

resources are cheaper than oil.
“The govemment~ should stand
ready" to insure that utilities can
afford to buy coal and nuclear
resources to enable them.to provide
energy.”

BY BILL MOORE

As it was last year at this time,
it is clear there will be an increase
in tuition bills when they arrive this

* summer. However, the extent of

the hike still isn’t clear.

Pitt's appropriation from the
state is still under consideration,
but hardly anyone has hope the
University will get the full 17%
increase requested. The increase
will probably fall more in line with
Gov. Milton Shapp’s 2.8%,recom-
mendation. '

put tuition at a neat $600. A lot of
people have suggested that would

speculation not based on the hard

Dear Students:

The cost of health care
delivery and health, insurance
has been skyrocketing national-
ly. This trend has existed for the
past several years and will
undoubtedly continue into the‘
foreseeable future. The Univer-
sity of "Pittsburgh. Student
Health Service is trapped in this
upward spiral which is dramati-
cally illustrated by the Student
Health Insurance premium that
has grown from $56.14 in
1972-73 to a projected ﬁgure of
$230 for 1976-77. The result has
been a decreased funding basis
for Student Health which now

I threatens its very existence. It is
our projection that if the Student
Health Service is to continue, an
alternative funding scheme ‘is
necessary. _ -

We have been aware of this
dilemma and I have asked _Dr.

i Joanne Robinson, Director of
the Student Health Service, to
develop a 'proposal(s) as to how
we can maintain or improve our
current level of health care yet.

‘do so at a lower cost to the
individual. _

The proposal which is most
acceptable from the standpoint
of providing good service at a
reasonable price establishes a
mandatory student health fee of
approximately $16 per term for
services at the Student Health
Service. The fee would bea line
item on each full-time student’s
invoice beginning with the fall,.

. Student Government Medical

1976. Part-time students who do
not elect to pay the fee would be
eligible to use the Student
Health Service on‘ a fee for
service basis. This would cover‘
services currently offered at
Student Health. Speciﬁc guide-
lines, of ' course, will be
developed on the fee for service
utilization. I

I have reviewed the proposal
in detail and shared it with the

Action Committee and the
Student Health Advisory Com-
mittee. It was also discussed at
length at the Chancellor’s
Student. Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee meeting on March 25,
1976. Students with whom I
have talked are generally
favorable tothe basic concepts
which include the aforemen-
tioned fee. However, they have
requested that I solicit addition-
al student‘ comments before I‘
recommend its adoption to the
Chancellor and the Board of
Trustees. I

Copies of the proposal are
available in my office, 100 S.U. I
would encourage you to stop in,
read the proposal and react to it.
Also, members of my staff will
be available to discuss the _
proposal and to answer any,

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

They Need Us

From the moment we entered kindergarden, we were indoctrinated

V with the importance of education. “You’ve got to get a high school

diploma or you won’t be able to get a job,” they told us. “You’ve got
to get a college diploma,” they told us, “or the Job you get,won t 
worth having.” They told us that if we work hard, and do well in

' ~ school, we can overcome class-barriers and become business tycoons,

and doctors, and lawyers and even presidents. Nothing, they told us,

 should be spared in the quest for education. It was our right, as
  Americans, to have the best education possible. -

These were the traditional American values and beliefs abo
education, but lately, the status of education has been slipping in our
 Last year, over 54 of all proposed school bonds were voted
down. Each year for the past decade. the scores on the Scholastic
Aptitude Tests have decreased. American high schools are now

graduating functional illiterates. ' I

Closer to home, the state legislature refuses to vote any adequate
increase in the amount of money given to higher education.

There are several reasons support for education has weakened.
Many people feel today that America has become a nation of
overeducated people, and that much of the education people receive is
impractical. The esteem people have for education decreases each
time they see a college graduate pumping gas. During a period when
people are worried about keeping their own jobs, they have little

interest in providing tax-money so others can get a diploma and enter

the job market. The only educational issue people are worried about
seems to be busing, and this controversy has only further reduced the
value people place on education in this country.

At Pitt, we should be especially concerned with the fall of education.
Pitt is a school whose students come largely from working-class
families, and who are more dependent on state aid to pay for the
increasing cost of learning. This state aid might become more difficult
to obtain as people feel less inclined to vote for increased education
subsidies.

Thisis regrettable, since the United States needs schools like Pitt, .
A and the kind of student Pitt turns out. Any society claiming to be

democratic needs an educated and responsible electorate.
» An industrial nation, the United States needs the kind of student Pitt

1 graduates to keep up with other industrialized nations, whose

educational systems, almost without exception, keep getting better.
If colleges are not to become available only to the rich, if class lines
in the United States are to remain ﬂuid and open to upward mobility, if
“the leaders of tomorrow’ ’—as politicians‘ like to put it—are to come
from all classes of society, then the right of each American to have the

best education possible had better remain a basic principle of our

society. We ask the state legislature to keep this in  when
allocating funds for higher education, because, simply, they need us.

The Pardon; A Replay  

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

‘ Recent revelations by journalists
Woodward and Bernstein about the
psyche of Richard Nixon in his last
days in office are good cause to
reﬂect on some of the circumstan-
ces surrounding his departure from
office and and subsequent pardon.

Most tend to consider Nixon as
the crook who unfortunately was
also our last president. For many
years Richard Nixon was, and still
is, a cursed name.

Woodward and Bernstein depict
a Nixon who deteriorated into a
blithering child who threw temper
tantrums over being picked on by
those naughty playmates in Con-
gress. Nixon, in this new light, is
not a ﬁgure to be despised, but
pitied.

Most also tend ._to believe the
pardon of Richard Nixon was an
executive plot, a payoff to get him
to leave office. President Ford is
chastised as an ignorant puppet of
the Nixon monster. -

But in view of the picture of
Nixon as a blubbering child, it is
hard to
capable of one more diabolical plot.
Through Watergate, Nixon had

gone to the well one too many
times. An organized plot was
beyond his capabilities. i

imagine Nixon being

The true story of the pardon
probably has its roots in a scene
very similar to the Nixon-Kissinger
scene described by Woodward and
Bernstein. Nixon, unable to cope
with reality, cried and banged his
fists on the floor while Kissinger
watched. It should be easy to
imagine,.then, a scene between
Nixon and Ford, a chapter that will
never be written but ‘only specula-
ted on.

Vice President Ford receives
word early one morning in the first
week of August that he should
report to the white house. This in
itself is not unusual, but the
message is delivered by Haig, who
usually delegates messenger tasks.

On his way to the White House
Ford considers the situation» He
knows the President has lost almost
all of his -support in Congress
because of the latest release of tape
transcripts. There ismuch public

talk of a resignation and the

minority leader of the Senate has
told him “You’re all we've got.”

At the White House Ford is met
by the President’s son in law, who
tells him that the President’s
emotional condition is unstable. He
suggests Ford keep a low proﬁle
and let the President do the
talking. He goes up to the Oval
office. A '

The President sits behind his

 

desk, holding his head in his
hands. '

“Why me, he groans, hardly
noticing Ford. “I’m ruined.” 

“You sent for me, Mr. Pretsi-"
dent?” says Ford, trying to keep a
professional air. J

“You’re going to be President.”

“Sir?"

“I’m resigning, dammit. It’s my~
only chance to keep from being
hounded for the rest of my life. If I
resign, maybe, just maybe, they
will say I did what was best for the
country and let everything else
go.”

“I’m sure that's the. case, sir,”
replies Ford, a little, shocked
because he ' had never personal‘ '
hear the President allude to bei ~.~;-.,,_
guilty ‘of anything before. ‘ A V ,

‘_‘No it isn’t,” says the President.
He looks up. His eyes are glossy.
He begins to pound the desk with
his fist, shouting “No it isn’t, No it .
isn’t.”

The President slumps into his
chair and begins to cry. He is no
longer even aware of Ford, who
shifts uncomfortably and begins to
eye the walls nervously. The
President waves his hands for Ford
to leave. Ford’ hesitates, I then
quickly «leaves the -room.

‘ Food Is F or People

BY JIM GUSIONE

Have you checked the price of
food recently? Most people know
that things from the supermarket
cost a little more, or that meal
tickets are more expensive now.
After all, inflation is hitting
everywhere; why should food be
different? Right?

Unfortunately, the situation is
not that simple: There are several
ifferent factors responsible for the
The
business community is one of these
factors. Call it agribusiness,
corporate "farming or a monopoly;
all are synonyms for symptoms of
this nation’s inﬂationary disease.
They have contributed far more
than their share to spiralling food
costs and related problems. ‘Large
corporations are controlling an

ever-increasing portion of the food
industry.

As an illustration, let us sit down
to dinner. The salad comes to us
via Gulf and Western Oil, ITT and
Dow Chemical, the meat from
Greyhound, the potatoes from
Boeing and the vegetables from
Tenneco. These are the same -folks‘

, that brought you the oil crisis,

payments to and involvement in
foreign governments, kickbacks
and illegal political contributions.
Do you really trust them with your
dinner? The Federal Trade
Commission has estimated the
priviledge of being served by large
corporations cost you _and.- ‘me
$2.6 billion in added food costs last
year. That is over $100 extra per
year for every person in this nation.
Food processors and distributers
are also responsible for much of the

problem of high prices. Price
ﬁxing, monopolies and- similar
tactics are the rule rather than the
exception in the food industry. A
few years ago there were approxi-
mately 32.000 food manufacturing
ﬁrms. But, a grand total of 50
companies, a mere ﬁfteen-
hundredths of one percent, control-
led 60% of all proﬁts. The industry
has become even more concen-
trated in recent years. Campbell
makes 90% of all canned soups.

Gerber controls 65% of the baby
food market; Heinz and Beech-Nut
share the rest. Del-Monte sell
one-half of the canned peaches
bought in the United States. These
are but a few examples indicative
of the entire food industry. A few

‘ large businesses are exerting a

stranglehold on the food industry.
The result is the corporations’

 
 

ability to charge exorbitant prices

with relativeiimpgunity; the compe-,_

titio_n either . doesn’t exist or is
engaged in mutual price-ﬁxing and
legal action is difﬁcult and often
tied up in appeal after appeal.

This situation is not unique to
food manufacturers. Large food
distributors use a similar system of
strangulation of competition and
exploitation of consumers. Most
large distributors are nation-wide
organizations. having" massive
amounts of resources at their
disposal. By selectively lowering
their prices in one area and raising
‘them in another to make up the
difference, the distributors can
effectively eliminate troublesome
competition without reducing their

proﬁts. And you and I pay the *

resulting high prices. If, however,
tactics such as these are unsuccess-
ful, price-ﬁxing and coercion will
be employed. Recently, Associated
Milk Producers, Inc., of Texas, the
nation’s largest dairy cooperative,
was brought to court. In an
out-of-court settlement AMPI paid
$230,000 in ﬁnes and admitted to
seventeen price-ﬁxing practices
including coercion,’ illegal kick-

the Justice Department’s investi- ’

and coercive practices.‘ These

examples are not isolated inci- .. ,-

SPARE THE Ron...

PHILADELPHIA (AP)-The
city school district has an elemen-
tary school in the works that
demands daily homework and strict
discipline; stresses the three R’s;
and discourages wearing sneakers
and jeans.

It would cost $657,000 a year to

‘ operate the school, which would be
r a separate facility.

But Doris

Oberhaltzer, school board vice

president, is wondering why it has

to cost anything at all.

“What is it going to cost to say
children have to come to school
properly attired and teachers have
to make students do homework?”
Oberholtzer asked. “I can’t
imagine why we're implementing it

- .in only one school.”

The school, which will begin next
September if it gets school board
approval, would house 470 stu-
dents in kindergarten through
grade six.’ Enrollment would be
voluntary and students who misbe-
have would be kicked out.

“I think we send children out in
the world unprepared,” said

Oberholtzer, who told the district _

superintendent to draw up plans
for the school. “Normally when a

RAPE TESTIMONY RULED UPON

HARRISBURG (AP)-
Pennsylvania Superior Court has
ruled that a rape victim testifying
in court- should not be cross-
examined about previous sexual
experiences.

The ruling was made in Dauphin
County rape case, in which a rape
victim was asked whether she ever
had sexual relations with a male.
The court’s decision was dated last
Monday but was not released until
the weekend.

Dauphin County Judge William
Caldwell said the Superior Court

in Pennsylvania.

In the majority opinion, Superior
Court Judge ‘Edmund B. Spaeth
said, ‘.‘A witness’ prior sexual
experience or lack of it...is not
relevant to credibility and therefore

credibility.” ‘

1973 after Dr. Sharon Johnson,
assistant professor in the School of
Medicine. was denied tenure, will
reopen in federal court today.

Fedral Justice William Knox will
hear remaining testimony in the
case. Due to its length and
complexity and the Court’s full
calendar, the case has been divided
into segments: two weeks of
testimony was heard in July, 1975;
three weeks in October, 1975; and
two weeks in December. is

Johnson’s attorney. Sylvia Ro-
berts, claims the case is expected
to set a precedent for sex
discriminationycases involving pro-
fessional women. Supporters of
the University position claim the
case could set a precedent that
would eliminate the right to award
tenure within the University and
force courts to rule on professors’
academic credentials. ,

Johnson was denied tenure in
October, 1971. After taking the
case through various’, University
bodies, she filed suit along with the
Pennsylvania chapter of the Na-
tional. Organization for Women,
charging the University with
violation of the ‘Civil Rights Acts of
1964 and 1966 and of the First and

Exam Reschedulin§‘~

Yes, there is something that can
be done about those exams during
the last week of class.

Exams can not be scheduled the
last week of class unless the
schedule change isapproved by the
dean of the school, according to
CAS Dean Robert Marshall.

Marshall said that ‘even though
the rule exists, it is difficult to
enforce. “I have no way of policing
the rule unless a student brings an
exam violation to my attention.”

An additional difficulty in enforc-
ing the ban on exams occurs
because some faculty claim the .
tests given are one of three given- _ "
the term, and are not technically”
ﬁnal exams, Marshall said.

Marshall encouraged students,
with complaints about exams
during the last week of class to.
notify him of the situation. ’

is usually stuffed with dollar bills
and coins. '

“I usually get about ten dollars
when I work after school. I’m only
out until nightfall; walking in the
streets after dark, asking for
money, is a good way to get your
head busted. And after dark, it’s
almost impossible to get anything
from women. You go up to them
and they think you’re going to rape
them, or steal their purse, and stuff
like that._ I ain't greedy; ten,
maybe ﬁfteen bucks. and 1 m
gonef’

He is almost worth the moeny he
gets. When he approaches and
asks for money, he looks as if he
would rather be doing anything in
the world but asking a stranger for
money—as if doing so made him
sick with embarrassement. His
face demands sympathy and,
watching it, people remember how
they felt when they went to pay for
something, only to find they had
lost their wallet. He is ‘never
aggressive, always polite and
seemingly sincere. He plays his
part like a veteran actor in his 500th
performance of the same Broadway
play; the acting has become second
nature.

“l've been doing this for about a
year. For a litii-c wllilc, I felt a little
I mean, people
thought they were helping me, and
I was ripping them off. So I
stopped doing it and got a job
washing dishes. Shit! That wasn’t
work—that'. was slavery. Two
weeks of that, and I was back on
the streets.”

He leaves Hillman and starts up

.toward Fifth Avenue, netting two

dollars from four people along the
way. ~
“I figure I’m not really hurting

‘A anybody; if ‘people really needed
‘ ‘the money,’they wouldn't give it to

me, right? And besides, after
people give me money,- they feel
good, so they’re actually getting

5:355; __ I l
something for their dollar.”

He reaches the Book Center and
looks around. He notices a group
of students coming down Univer-
sity Place from Mervis’ Hall, and
then forgets them: Very few
people, he knows, will give him
anything when they_ are with
somebody else. It’s better to get
people by themselves, one on one.

A male student wearing a yellow
Pitt T-shirt comes down the street,
and the panhandler, who refuses to
give his name, or even the name of‘
his "high school, goes into his
act—-—the same act he has been
using without variation since he
started panhandling and which, he
claims, is successful 50% of the
time.

“Excuse me sir, I’ve lost my
wallet—” "

The student glances at him,
grunts, and shakes his head, never

slowing his pace, never even giving '

enough time for the rest of spiel.
The panhandler just shrugs, walks
up the street toward Presbyterian- —
University Hospital, and trys it
again on a tall blond nurse.

This time he is more successful,
and he adds the ﬁnal dollar of the

day to the small roll of dollar bills

he had in his pocket. He has
collected ten dollars-today.
Tomorrow, he’ll work the-down-
town streets. and ll.: rim; after
that, he'll go up to East Liberty.

“I'm not really worried abou

else.’ They really can’t even call a
cop because no cop would arrest
me over a dollar. And besides,
they’d feel like a damn fool,

No Razzle-Dazzle Hypnosis

BY NANCY WINTNER

It was a dark night. The trail
lights blew out just as Margaret
Woods spotted the enormous hole
ahead. She tried to grab control of
the snowmobile’s wheel, but it was
too late. Her son, Jimmy, was
thrown from the vehicle onto a
nearby hill.

Unable to see the blood
streaming from the gash above his
eye, Jimmy panicked and screamed
for help.

“Would you hypnotize me,
Mom, I think I’m going blind?"

She hypnotized Jimmy and
rushed him to the hospital.

Margaret Woods isa mother, a
high school teacher and a hypnotist
with a private practice in Wilkins
Twp. In her ten years of practice,
heavy smokers, nail biters and
fearful drivers have come to her for
professional advice. Even alcoho-

lics have sought her help but,
because regular visits to a
hypnotist are costly, Woods sug-
gests they get free advice from
Alcoholics Anonymous.

Not everyone can be hypnotized,
so Woods first interviews clients to
learn how resistant to authority or
how suggestible they are. She
doesn't learn everything from this
interview, but she gets a start.

Woods explained most people
think one visit is enough to cure
their problem and don't bother to
come back. But actually, several
visits and follow-ups are ‘needed-
—one follow-up she suggests is

 if self-hyen.osis- :' A

“Everyone should self-hypno;
tize,” she said. “I don’t believe in
total heterhypnosis, where “you

hypnotize a. person and he never

learns himself.” .

Self-hypnosis, Woods explained,
is a way of talking to one’s self after
reaching a certain state of mind.
She labeled the advanced or more
highly suggestible self hypnotisers
as “high yogies."

“It’s power of concentration,”
she added. “The deeper you
concentrate, the more physical
things you can do.”

Woods criticizes what she calls
the “razzle dazzle of suggestion”
—where the hypnotist tries to make
a subject hold lit cigarettes
between his ﬁngers without burn-
ing his ﬂesh.

“Those are the extremes,” she
added. “That’s the kind of stuff

they put on television, and then

everybody that can’t do that ‘thinks
they can’t be hypnotized.”

Woods is totally against hypnosis
being used for entertainment.
Hypnotism used in this respect is
abused. according to Woods. and
consequently she never performs
or uses hypnosis for this purpose.

“I may not have a developed
sense of humor or a need for_
showmanship." she said, “but I
don’t like it when you make people
feel uncomfortable——afterwards
youjfeel embarrassed about what
you made them do." _,

Although hypnotism has been
used frequently for "entertainment
purposes. Woods said -many of
these “crazy .things"= are now

. .b_eing;banned. She s_aid_hyp:no_sis_isj

now being used for the medical
profession—for good causes.

“But it’s not a cure-all,” she
stressed. “It’s no special dust you
sprinkle on anybody that makes

you twinkle. But television makef,

it look that way and occasionally I’ -
‘ like to put my foot through the set

when I see these crazy absurdities.
It gives people _a crazy concept.”

Many of Woods’ clients with
severe problems come. to her with
the attitude that under hypnosis
“everything is going to go away.”
These people need psychiatrists or
doctors for their problems-—not
hypnosis, she explained.

“But it is excellent, for sex
problems,” she added,_ “and very
good for _childbirth. But a person
must be at a certain suggestibility
level. I may have someone go
through something _more comforta-
bly, but not the way he would like
to."

Woods’ practice is not limited to
her office. Often, she ‘ receives
“emergency calls" and visits her
clients at their homes.

“Many people are homebound,”
she explained. “You just don't tell

a person who’s down

overf’

Woods explained, though, that
once her clients are hypnotically
conditioned, she will use sugges-
tion over the phone—as long as
someone else is there.

—-We were sitting in the Pitt News

kind of feature story we wanted to

“Well, we coulddo something

“An honest man—we could look

The only person available was a
salesman from Missouri.

“Where can we ﬁnd an honest

I man?” we asked. '

“In a church or a synagogue,”
he replied. “An honest person is a,
person with high moral standards
who is repentant. They also have a.
deep personal’ sense of justice.”

Sounded good, so we put him

‘  ‘, wn as a suspect’ for an honest

man. But we quickly realized this
line of investigation was going
nowhere fast. So we decided to go
to some professionals—the philoso-
phy department.

» But no one was there.

We devised our own test. A
dollar bill was crumpled up and
placed on the floor. We blended
conspicuously into the crowd.

Two woman came by and one
said to the other, “Look, adollar’
billl” She scooped it up and made
for the door. Reacting quickly to
loss of‘ income, we

our surprise she returned the
money, no questions asked.
‘ ‘I believe most people are

_. ’ honest. When 1- saw you ‘coming I

thought you needed the money
much more than I did,” University
Times staff member Lorraine
Blotzer said.

Our plan worked but it worked
too well. Everyone returned the
money as soon we confronted
them." So we changed our tactics.

Instead of a solitary, crumpled-up .

dollar, we inserted two dollars in a

arked envelope and placed it on
-he ﬂoor_. Our subjects had two
choices: either to turn in the
envelope to the Student Union desk
(an honest thought) or make off
with the loot (an honest reaction).
Within minutes the bait was
snatched. The apparently honest
person turned in the money without
hesitation. But he could not stop to
‘accept any kudos—he was honestly

late for class.

. . . . , . . . . . . . . . _ . _ _ — _ . _ r _ . , - a

Not everyone held such high
moral standards. About half of the
students would have earned an
easy two dollars if we had not
apprehended them. One cynical
young man, after being cajoled into
returning the envelope, was asked
if he’d had any thought of
returning the money to the Student
Union desk. I

“No, take the money and run, '

that's what anyone else would do.”

When the same fellow learned-
the object of our quest he retorted, .
“If you do’ ﬁnd an honest man let 5

me know. I’d probably advise him
otherwise.”

The most dazzling display of

honesty was turned in by student
Elbert Gaither. Gaither decided to
eliminate the middle man and
immediately began to telephone
the name on the envelope. What
motivated this upstanding citizen?
“If he (the name on the
envelope) is a student, he’s
probably not working and doesn't
have much money. If you cheat
somebody, sooner or later someone
will cheat you.”

Thus ended a fruitful day of ,
investigation. .7
FRIDAY, MARCH 26-—We once

again picked up the trail of the
honest man ‘in the streets of

 
 

us another angle.

“Sure I know an honest person;
my six-month-old daughter."

We pressed him for a detailed
account of her honesty. “Well, she
does what she wants, rolls around
in hercrib. I haven’t seen her do
anything dishonest.”

The search called for a philo-
sophical approach. Since no one at
the philosophy department was in,
we consulted Dr. Jack Daniel,
associate dean of CAS.

. “Check yourself out at first. If
you are not honest then you can't
find an honest man.

“I try to be honest," Daniel
conﬁded, “but I tell lies to myself
at times.” V

We narrowed our choice down to
two possibilities. If the dollar test is
considered supreme, no one could

unabashedness is the criteria, then
Dan Meloro’s six-month-old
daughter is the obvious choice. It’s

Once, her son Jimmy had an
infected fleshwound trimmed with
a knife; a very painful experience,
according to the family doctor. The
doctor said Jimmy would never sit

novacaine. So, using hypnosis,

Her children generally like the
idea of their mother being a hypno-

mothers are hypnotists.”

And Woods’ high school stu-
dents are fascinated by having a
hypnotist for a teacher. As for her
fellow teachers-they usually seek
advice, she said. 1

Woods’ interest in hypnosis
began after she was treated for a
medical problem by a professional
hypnotist. After her doctor made
the diagnosis, Woods was told she
must take daily amounts of a drug,
hydrocortisone. ’ Since an over-
abundance of the drug causes
serious side effects, Woods’
physician referred her to a
hypnotist who put her on minimum
dosages through suggestion. It

“Hey, it’s a rough life!” Jesse

the traditional blues classic. This

Even in the 1970's this commun-
al spirit carried over into the size of
the Dead’s touring parties. Often
times the group traveled with a
literal army of people.

“On the Europe ’72 tour, the
Grateful Dead's touring party
consisted of over 50 people. All the
old ladies, the kids, roadies,
friends, etc. It was a hell of a good
time; in fact, it was one constant
party," Mclntire smiled. “But a

“With that many people doing so

trying to pull it all together...well,
you can very easily do a mild

Weir and Mclntire ‘ both V have-
lived through two of the biggest
events in the history of rock. The
Altamont concert disaster in the
fall of 1969, where four people in a
crowd of 300,000 were killed, and
Watkins Glen, where an expected
crowd of 150,000 people turned into

Speed of Sound, Wings
Capitol Records, SW-11525

Add this bewildering album to
your disappointment that Paul
McCartney will not be “winging
it” to the steel city in his upcoming
tour.

His seventh solo record (if
indeed we consider working with
four other band members a solo),
Speed of Sound is a drastic switch
from the rockier stuff /McCartney
got into, and finally succeeded with
on the last two albums.

This one is bound to have less
commercial appeal because of a

toned down approach both in
production and packaging.
Speed of Sound, with its

abandoning of the -old McCartney
formulas—the rampant time
changes, the nonsensical musical
phrases attached here and there,
the climactic ﬁnishes—is not a bad
album, as a matter of fact it may go
on to be a great album, but for the
moment let's just call it different.
For one thing, McCartney can

bring himself to sing only six of the '

11 tracks. The rest are handled by
wife Linda, Denny Laine, Jimmy
McCulloch and Joe English. You
want’ McCartney? Go buy a
McCartney album, this is Wings.

The Pitt Men’s Glee Club appeared this weekend as part of the

University’s Stephen Foster Festival. Demas photo

Opinion _ ‘ A B
  Music Fans at Pitt?
‘ BYPAMELAEUSI 1

Tradition. Tradition is a word that seems to be rampant.in this, the
year of our country’s two-hundredth birthday. It never dies. There
remains one stickler in the world who must adhere to “the tradition.”
The reasons for this are vague: Because it’s there, we've always done
it, etc. Traditions can be a sickening thing.

This weekend, Pitt presented the ‘Stephen Foster Music Festival,
which was full of traditions, from Foster’s music to Bicentennial song
medleys. On Friday, Pitt’s pa-rt in the production (besides the job of
hostingthe festival) included the Men’s Glee Club and the Women’s
Choral. On Saturday the Men’s Glee Club appeared with the Men’s
Glee Clubs of the University of Cincinnati and Indiana University of Pa.

The selection of music on both nights was superb, and in the formal
sections of the concerts direction and execution were accurate and
exact. 

Attendance at the concerts did not break a Pitt record, and even
though admission was free with a Pitt ID, students seemed to have an
air of nonchalance about the whole thing.

Despite the role played by tradition in the fest there was no sickening
emphasis on the “red, white and blue” or,American ideals—just a lot
of good choral singing and what’s more important, the. people in the

festival acted like they really enjoyed what they were doing.’ There was -

no heavy pressure on anyone to be super-professional‘ but that’s what
impressed me the most——the professionalism of the groups involved.

The “home” concert on Friday contained a more formal section
before intermission and a relaxed, nostalgic “American Collage” of
music from the 1890s (a banjo and mandolin club) to the present day
folk group and songs of the 70s.

Two outstanding segments of the collage were the Looney Tunes, a
ﬁne barbershop quartet and a 50s number, “Summer Nights.”

Saturday night, a large selection of traditional and current music \

rang through Carnegie Music Hall- All in all, an
presented by some exciting music-makers. _. .

Programming, featuring Kingfish, brought in a mere thousand people. -

Music activities throughout the year did not -attract the expected
crowds. At the Homecoming concert (Stephen Stills, remember him?)

0 half of the seats were filled.

Granted this is getting into a bad time of the year, with finals and all,
but where was the support the rest of the year? Do Pitt students care
about the music groups and shows on campus, or would they rather sit
in their own little cubbyholes, listening to newly-released albums that
are worth a few playings till they get discarded. with the rest of the‘
worn-out fads? Whatever the answer, I hope Pitt students soon wake
up to music, especially the live kind.

that permeates many of his songs.
A mellow flute, soft conga rhythm
and low crowd cheer open the tune.

Training Program in

ARCHAEOLOGY   A 

Applications are now available for the the 1970 Meadowcroft

Field Project and Training Program in Archaeology. The Meadow-. ;
croft Field Project is sponsored by the Department of Anthtopo- _  ‘

logy,.University of Pittsburgh, and is directed by Dr. J. M. Adov-
asio and Dr. J. D. Gunn. The project is designed to intensively in-,
vestigate the prehistory, paleoecology and geomorphology of the

Cross Creek drainage area of southwestern Pennsylvania. Since-.

1973, the focal poi_nt of the Project has been Meadowcroft Rock-

shelter, a deeply-stratified, multi-component site in the Cross _'

Creek drainage. The rockshelter presently offers the oldest and

longest evidence of human occupation in this hemisphere, with.,_ f

, an extremely well-dated sequence beginning in the late 15th mill-
ennium B.C. and extending through the historic period. The pro-
ject will expand excavations at Meadowcroft Rockshelter, as well
as continue excavations at a series of other sites in the Cross

Creek Drainage. The a_rchaeologica| reconnaissance and geomor-. .

phological investigation of the drainage will also be continued. ‘

3:30 to 6 PM A The 1976 Project will begin on June 23 and will terminate Aug- 1
. Saturdays ust 14. Participation in the program is. open to qualified under- _
 graduate and graduate students. Students without prior exper- =

ience will be assigned to one of several sites in the Cross Creek  ,

Life and Times,’ Billy Cobham,
Atlantic Records, SD 18166
 Billy Cobham’s new release, Life
5-and Times, further develops the
"azz-rock style he has been so’.
If’ successful with. It is a big
_'Iﬁiprovement over his previous
‘galbum, A Funky Thide of Sings,
which lacked creativity and sound-
‘ed overly commercial.
“ The Brecker Brothers, Tommy
_l Bolin _(now with Deep Purple) and
U.Io_hn Abercrombie are just a few of
» the talented musicians who have
. played on Cobham’s albums. The
personnel on Life and Times
includes Cobham on drums, John
‘V; Scoﬁeld on guitar, Dawilli Gonga
jjjontkeyboards and Doug Rauch on
Jfbass. All of them perform very
well,’ especially Scofield, whose
electrifying guitarwork dominates
‘the music.
' -v-The’ selections range
, electro-funkto mellow. The album
“ opens with the title track, “Life and
Times." It takes you on a_ rhythmic
journey as the band keeps
changing tempos and later ex-
jplodes into a furious bass and

“Earthlings” gets things rolling
on the second side. Besides
playing drums Cobham does some
nice work on Moog synthesizer.

“On A Natural High’? is . a
high-energy rocker that is high-
lighted by Scoﬁeld’s screeching
guitar and Cobham’s synthesizer.
It starts out with a “disco” sound;
but develops into an intense

 

instrumental jam.
Cobham is a talented percus-

sionist, but he also is a gifted

composer and proves this on the
two-part “Song For A Friend.”
This is a very emotional piece that
has a very free and relaxed feeling
to it. Scoﬁeld’s soulful acoustic
guitar-sets the mood while the rest
of the band provides a soothing
background.

Cobham’s biggest problem is
that financial pressures have, at
times, ’ forced him into the
commercial rut. He wants to sound
original but he also wants to

appeal to the masses, and "this is",
what Life and Times’ is geared at

doing.

looked outside of our trailer and
saw about 500 people cramped
tightly into a small area by our
banks of speakers, to the left of the
stage. I went back inside and
looked out about a half hour later
and nearly had a heart attack! The
crowd by those speakers had to be
nearly 10,000 human beings
packed like sardines....in a blister-
ing sun, on one of the most humid
days that summer. They couldn’t
move, or get to water,...it looked
like the start of another Altamont,”
Mclntire said. _

“Bill Graham, a San Francisco
rock promoter, controlled that
situation. He got up. onstage,
pulled out a water hose and
proceeded to water down those
10,000 people for ‘nearly 20
minutes, and disaster was avoid-

Weir said.

The Grateful Dead has toured
throughout the world, and I asked
Weir and Mclntire how they would
compare Europe in general to the
United States?

“Europe’s pace of living is much
slower than it is in the United
States...I mean...it’s been around
longer. I guess they would’ look

upon the United States as a bunch
of...country kids,” Weir said
humorously.

“England is one country_that is

strange. Its musicians have
cornered a big chunk of the
American music market, but

still...you ask Mick Jagger or John
Lennon what their biggest thrill is,
and they'll tell you it was meeting
Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley.

America deﬁnitely has some sort of

mystique,” Mclntire answered
philosophically. .
“Has the Grateful ‘Dead dis-

banded for keeps?” I asked.

“We never parted because of
personality clashes, we just decid-
ed to take aesabbatical from playing

together,” answered Weir.
My last question to Weir was

“What’s more important, copping
big bucks or your music?” '

“I’ve made allot of money in the
last twelve years, but everything I
make goes back into the music_...I
just built a studio in my home in
California with money I could’ve
used for a Rolls Royce, or
whatever,” he said.

“I’ve been a musician nearly all
my life....to be perfectly honest, I
wouldn’t know how to do anything
else.”

A Rice--Unspectacular?

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

This is what the days of practice
came down to—the annual Dapper
Dan Roundball Classic, featuring
the best high school basketball
talent in the country.

It meant a lot, to the players from

all over the United States, and to

the fans, who didn’t really come to
see the Pennsylvania Stars win.
The crowd of 16,000 plus was the

largest ever to see a basketball‘

game in Pittsburgh.

Some of the roundballers were
on their game and lived up to their
highly-touted reputations. But

. _there were others who just didn’t
‘live up to expectations." ’

MIKE RICE

in her collegiate career, she and
partner Baskin were shut out in the
ﬁrst, set, losing 0-6, 4-6.

In second doubles, Seebold and
Terry‘Lies split sets, 3-6, 6-4, and
lost the third set 0-6. Conway and
Irwin brought in the sole doubles
victory, 7-5, 7-6.

“It’s better competition, plus the
fact we haven't been practicing
much at all—about an hour and a
half per week," Conway explained.

“Lock Haven is a very good
team,” Gordon said. “They have a
lot of depth. It was a very, very

close match; it was very good :

tennis. ’ ’

The team will try to reacquire
those old winning ways of the fall
season soon—and preferably be-

Pitt recruits Sonny Lewis and
Mike Rice took the court that night,
hoping to leave a summer-long
impression on Panther fans who
came to see these “super
recruits” perform. 1

"Lewis did more than his share for
the home-state cause, pouring in 20
and being named the
Pennsylvania player of the game.

Michael Rice, the highly regard-
ed 6-7 forward from Frederick,
Maryland, struggled through 25
minutes of playing time, producing
only 4 points _and 4 rebounds. he
was hardly crushed by such a
mediocre homecoming, perhaps
because he was happy just to_ be
there. '

“I played pretty‘ lousy tonight,

didn’t I?” he asked when ap- "

proached him in the locker room.
“I don't really know what
happened out there tonight,” Rice
said, still ‘bubbling with the
excitement that surrounds
Dapper Dan. “I couldn’t get "it
together, man. Just couldn’t get it
together.” ,

His motion wasn’t haphazard or
sluggisli, the usual attributes of
He was ﬂuid,
smooth and aggressive. The type
of player that would ﬁt well into the
Panther system?

“I've followed Pitt for a long

of tough breaks this year, but  .
think with the summer workouts
and practice I’ll get up at the Field
House, we’ll be able to get back
into it next year.”

Panther Coach Tim Grgurich, A
who was on hand at the Roundball
festivities, concurred. “Michael’s a
ﬁne young man, and a hell of a ball
player. It’s absurd to judge' his
abilities on this one performance,
and you should consider the fact

that he was there, part of an‘

11-man team representing the best
high school players ~ in the I

Maryland? - , ‘

“Coach Grgurich~ has been
following me around since I was in
eighth grade,” Rice said with a
smile. Rice is actually a native.
Pennsylvanian, hailing from near- -
by Rankin. “\Yea, I met Coach
Grgurich a longtime ago, and he’s
been talking to me ever since. I've
always followed Pitt basketball,
and I always knew that when I went
to school, Pitt would be high on my
list."

“Don’t .be dismayed at the way§-$3
Mike played tonight,” said Pitt '
assistant Bob Hill. “We’ve seen
him play before, and we know what
he’s capable of.”

As I suspected, the ﬁrst U.S.
All-Star to sign with Pitt didn’t
come outof a hat.

Depth Is More Than   ,
What’s|n The Hole  

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

Depth is important -in many
sports. In basketball, you've got to
have that sixth man who can come
off the bench and spark a team
when momentum is going the other
way. ~

In golf, yes golf, depth is
important too——especially since it is
played as a team sport on the
college level. The Pitt golf team
found out Friday just how much
depth it has with triangular match
victories over Duquesne and West
Liberty State.

Playing at their home course,
Verona's Green Oaks Country
Club, the Panthers held the low
score of 407, against a 410 total for
the Dukes and West Liberty’si 426.

  Lost Marbles Not Lost Cause For Hood

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

“When you start out as a hockey
player, you have a lot of marbles
and as you proceed along playing
the game, you keep losing them.
After you’ve lost all your marbles,
you become a referee”—NationaI
Hockey League [NHL] referee
Bruce Hood.

Several minutes before the start
of a hockey game, three men step
onto the ice surface, accompanied
by a round of jeers, and scoot like

' water spiders around the rink.

Dressed in what many fans call
“convict uniforms,” these men are
the two linesmen and the referee.

Then the public address an-
nouncer blares out the introduc-
tions—-ﬁrst the visiting team, then
the home, with scattered applause
for the former and_ fervent
appreciation of the latter. After the
cheers fade away, it’s time to greet
the ofﬁcials.

“The linesmen for tonight's
game are Neil Armstrong and
Claude Bechard,” says the PA
announcer. “The referee is Bruce
Hood." Now, “Kill the umpire”
sounds like “Hail, Mary” com-

pared to some of the phrases from
the stands directed at Hood and his
crew as they line up at center ice
for the National Anthem. It’s safe
to say the officials don’t have many
friends.

“Well, that’s recognition,”
Hood said. “lt’s identity. I’ve been
around long enough now that
everyone pretty well knows me. I
have a job to do out there, so I just
block it out.”

Like umpires in baseball, hockey
officials are the most hated and
abused people at a sporting event.
Besides taking ﬂack from players
on both teams, who, itseems, can
never be pleased by a call, a
referee is under attack by ﬂying
pucks, slashing sticks and mis-
guided checks. I

Hood, from Toronto, is a
handsome, seemingly dynamic
man. His likable fortyish counten-
ance is marred by several scars on
his chin and upper lip-souvenirs
from games he has officiated.

During a Penguin ‘game last
week, Hood was pummeled in the
arm and the legby errant pucks,
but said those bumps and bruises
are nothing compared to other
injuried he has suffered.

“The worst was probably the

collided with Chuck Lefley in St.
Louis,” he said. “It was a direct
hit. but just a freak accident, like
having a car accident, and I broke
the jaw in three places.”

A referee spends much of the
game right in the middle of the
action—comparable to a home
plate umpire, who is involved with

‘every pitch. He will follow a

frequently for his desire to get .a

The linesmen in hockey have
somewhat easier jobs. Their time is
spent skating from line to line,
looking for off-side or icing
violations, chasing after loose
pucks ‘when play has stopped and

draw the ire of the crowd.

“It’s a challenge," Hood said.
“Every night's a challenge. Every
second out there you don’t know
what's going to happen. There’s a
lot of big plays. But it's interesting
and it's a good career. I've been
making a living at it for 15 years.”

Becoming a referee in the NHL is
a long, drawn-out procedure,

similar to the one followed by the-

players seeking to reach the major
leagues. The road is not a pleasant
one, but the rewards may be more
than worth it. -

“I played hockey in Canada,”
Hood -said, “and I started by
ofﬁciating some minor hockey, like
the industrial _leagues, then the
OHA (Ontario Hockey Associaton)
and up through the ranks of junior
and senior.

“I had a tryout with the National
Hockey League and worked a year
in the International League back in
’62-63, then came up the ladder
through the Central League and the
American League It’s the same with
the pl'ayers—we start out in the
minors and they work us along.”

3 The lmir: bright spot in the cloud
of darkness was turned in by Harry
Habbel, number-three man for
Coach George Dieffenbach’s
troops. Habbeloutdistanced Randy
Lang, 6-4, 7-6. With the score 5
-4 in the ﬁrst _set, Habbel,
desperately needed to win his
service game. Playing an extremely
conservative game, he methodical-
ly disposed of his opponent in the
tenth and final game of the ﬁrst
set, and was on his way to Pitt’s
only victory.

With the score tied at six games
apiece in the second set, Habbel

 

again won under pressure condi-
tions. winning the tiebreaker, 5-4.

Pitt’s number one player, Joe
Sakalik, lost a see-saw 6-4, 3-6, 6-3
battle to Steve Genter and Mike
Habbe , ranked number two for the
Panthers, also lost, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 to
Steve Brooke from Beaver, Pa.’ The
Habbel-Brooke match was perhaps
the most competitive of the day,
and when asked if the Panther loss
was disappointing, Habbel replied,

SQUEAKY BLASTS CBS’
HELTER SKELTER

SAN DIEGO (_AP)—‘Lynette
“Squeakv" Frnmme. the Charles
Manson follower who was convict-
ed of trying to kill President Ford,
says the ChaI‘ZlC[Cl‘lL11ll0I1 «)1 Man-
son in the tclcxision movie “Helter
Skelter” was “repulsive.”

Miss Fromme, who faces life
imprisonment, made her comments
Saturday while awaiting her
assignment to federal prison in San
Diego. She told the San Diego
Union in a telephone interview that
she watched the two part CBS
movie on Thursday and Friday.

“I wouldn’t have followed the

man they showed the American ,

public for 10 minutes,” she said,
adding that actor Steve Railsback,
who portrayed Manson, “played a
genius like a contemporary idiot.”

SHAPP’S RIGHTHAND
MAN MAY RESIGN

HARRISBURG (AP)—Richard

Doran, top advisor to Gov. Shap, 

said yesterday he is considering
resigning as executive assistant to
the governor.

Doran said he and the governor
have discussed placed Doran in a
special assignment post to develop
priorities and programs for various
government departments.

He said such a position would
last only a few months and would
remove him as the governor’s
righth_and man. “One of my
intentions is to get out of the

24-hour burden of being bogged\

down in all the day-to-day matters.
By no means \\.mltl it he the same
thing as executive assistant.”
