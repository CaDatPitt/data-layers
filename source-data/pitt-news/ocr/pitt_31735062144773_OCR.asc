1922 against Stanford Univer-

sinecure for the Golden Pan-I

ledger.‘ Drake has a well-coached and. tricky team, and has. a

habit of springing surprises in

home‘ contests. It will be the

year's biggest game in Des Moines and is expected to draw a

capacity crowd at the ﬁne Drake

A\

 . A number of alumni who are 10-»
' . cated in Iowa, and as.far East from

there as Chicago, have written in
for ticket reservations and have

” been advised how to secure them.

The Drake management is holdin

“a. block of seats and will take goo

care of all Pitt‘ rooters. _
In addition to the alumni, a num-

ll   ber of former Pittsburghers who are

located in Iowa are having reserva-

  tions made and will be on hand to
 cheer for the Panthers.

In Chicago Tomorrow
The football party will spend to-

 '. marrow in Chicago and will practice

in the Stagg Field of the University

 of Chicago, thanks to the courtesy

of Director of Athletics A. A. Stagg.
Alumni of Chicago will have this

 7 opportunity of seeing the team.

Headquarters will be at the Winder-
mere Hotel. _ '

The party will leave Pittsburgh

This is the second game the Fresh-
men have played in Greensburg, ap-
earing against W. & J. «-Freshmen

"take the trip from Pittsbur h to.

action, and Greensburg and West-
moreland County Pittites will be out
in‘force. ‘
Carnegie the Big Game

The next big home game is with

Carnegie Tech, October 22, at the

i  Stadium. This looks like the biggest

game of the _year, and judging by
the interest, it may draw a crowd
that willpack the Stadium. Pitt

alumni and Tech alumni have been

talking about this game for the past

-year, and 'l‘ech's memorable defeat

ot Notre Dame has given their team
a national reputation.
The Panthersand Tech have each

“won one of the games played 1311115

‘far in the Stadium. The honor of
dedicating the bowl was given to
Tech in 1925, and the Panthers won.
Last year, the Tartans turned the
tables. This year it looks like a.

. Pittyear, and Pitt alumni are. very’
iconﬁdent that the Tartans Wlll be

turned back. The task “"'.ll not be

. Moth Repellants Found

‘ By Industrial Fellows“

Completion of a1’six-year investi-
gation by Lloyd E. Jackson and

Helen E..Wassell, senior and junior

industrial fellows of Mellon Insti-
tute, havea-evealed-that nothing dis-
courages a‘— moth’s appetite for’. fab-
rics and; furs, more _«than cinchona
alkaloids,  _.__‘ ‘ _

Wot"-kin in the interest of the
Munda-tegm’ ” ‘cal Society of Ameri-
ca, composed ». of a ;_g-1-oup of dry-—

cleaners and dyers, Jackson and.

Miss Wassell have ‘made ﬁndings,ex-
pected to result‘ in great saving for
cleaning companies;

More than 4,000 “gallons of cine‘
chona alkaloid, solutions have ‘been
used commercially by dry-cleaning
plants about the country. Plants ‘at

which practical tests were made are

located in eight‘ large cities. ,
“Products of the ‘_cinchona alka-
said Jackson, “have ' been

heretofore unsatisﬁed by other moth
repellents. — -They — aare inodorous;
they adhere to P the materials to:
which‘they_- are applied, can be. put
on evenly like ‘a dyestutl‘; they are
not apparent on. the niaterials
treated: they do not dust oﬂ'; they
do not affect undesirably the ph Sl-
cal properties of textile ﬁbers; t ey
can be made soluble in inexpensive
organicsolvents, such as petroleum
naphtha, as well as in water; they
are non-toxic to human beings; they
are valuable clothes-moth repellants,
and they are economical to use in-.
dustrially.” 1

PITT MALE STUDENTS
EARN $300 ON AVERAGE

Approximately twenty per. cent
of Pitt male students are wholly
self-supporting, seventy per cent are
partially self-supporting, and only
ten per cent are fully dependent
upon parental support. The aver-
age earnings of students during the
school‘ year amounts to $300, ac-
:cording to Perry, head of the em-
ployment bureau.

The average total expenditures of
a student for twelve months _is
$1,100, according to an estimate
‘made by the bureau. Of this amount
the students contribute about $500
earned by summer, part-time, and
week-ends; work. ,  .  C

. The extent of their work is from
demonstrating the latest style in
bathingsuits to singing, from bag-
gage smashing to tutoring, from
cleaning windows to acting as ex-
tras in theatrical productions. One
student earned $54,000 last year by
selling real estate in his spare
time. Another e..rned $3 a day
with room and board as companion
to an alcoholic patient.

"Other students have the less
spectacular jobs. of chauffeurs, gas
station attendants, soda clerks,
ushers and waiters.

The purpose, of the employment
bureau is to help the self-support-
mg student ﬁnd satisfactory em-

 

secure competent men.

you can.” " _

VEN the way that wires are twisted together

in making connections has an important bear-
ing on proper use of explosives. ‘Electric blasting is
hedged around with most elaborate rules and pre-
cautions. .There are series and parallel connections,
parallel series and series parallel circuits. Blasting
machines or power’ circuits for electric blasting are
surrounded with great mystery.

In Chapter Three of the Blasters’ Handbook this
matter of blasting circuits is illustrated and com-
prehensively described. The selection and use of
galvanometers, rheostats and blasting machines are
explained. Tells how to prevent misﬁres, how to test
,a circuit, how to locate a break, how to use a resis-
tance table and many other practical phases of blast-
ing circuits.
The Blasters’ Handbook, prepared originally for the use of
du Pont field service men, is an extremely practical reference
and study work. Leading technical institutions are using the
Blasters’ Handbook in their classrooms. Pocket size for your

lDe:ar Editor: ’
A ‘As a member of the downtrodden
 -class of 1930, I would like to ask
’, you just what your policy towards
 the members of my sect may be. In
ljthe ﬁrst issue of the Weekly you
‘O intimate through your editorial col-
umns that the freshmen ‘should not
fbe paddled but rather. be guided by
 some mystic agency called “Cus-
toms.”
, “Customs” may be better, more
. civiliied, more Pittlike than “Regu-
lations,” but why do we need any-
thing at all ‘done with us, or by us,
or for us? Why limit the choice
_ between “Customs” and “Regula-
tions?” Is not “Nothing” a third
and better choice?
I would like to suggest that you
A devote part of your editorial column
’ totell us the reasons why we should
. V have even “Customs,” rather than
. say that “Customs” are better than
’ “Regulations,” and deplore the fact
7 thatva few sophomores are well ac-
quainted with the mission in life that
a /barrel stave holds.
Sincerely yours,

, Gibby Welch ran 105 yards for, a-

touchdown last Saturday. This feat
placed him among the immortals in
 Pittfootball history, and the only
‘  thing that Gibby can do to make us
 . happy is to make a few more of his
” lengthy runs in the Carnegie Tec ~
game. V .

 

Coach Jock Sutherland has been i

saving Welch as muchas heﬁcan»so
far this season. Welch played. only
a few minutes in the West Virginia
game and didn’t even get into‘ the
fracas against Grove City. We think
that that accounts for the showing of
Gibby so far this season. .. If Welch
used his energy in every game, as he
did last season, we are quite sure
that he wouldn’t be making many
’ long runs. The whole thing comes
back to the fact that Coach Suther-

land has enough good subs to use in .

place of his star ball carriers. It is
the subs that make Granges and
,Welchs.

 

 The work of Wilps was very com-

: I mendable in the West Virginia game.

 1 He shows the makings of a Welch or
a Hagan. _

 

. Pitt will have a better track team

,3 next spring than it did during the
E . last cinder-path campaign. The vet-
. er-ans coming» back to the team are;
Captain Gilbert Welch, Vic Pickard,
Pete Bowen, Robert Roy, Donn
Gwinn, Wood Adams, Chuck Voight,
Ken Wibecan, Harry Robb, William .

. Grossett, Harry Long and High Wil-

- liams. New men on the team who
3.“ will add strength are: Knoblock,
» hurdler; Wherry, quarter-miler;
Comfort, middle-distance‘ star; Mc-

dict of‘ Dr. Samuel H.‘William‘s as
to his expedition‘ into the jungles of
British Guiana last summer,’ to
gather material on the geographic
distribution of insects, especially-
beetles. Dr. Williams, head of the
zoology department, returned to
Pittsburgh last week and left on
Sunday for Breslau, Germany, where
he will complete his studies on
beetles duringthe year in the Bres-
lau university.
Deserted by his Indian paddlers
and guides, he was left strandedfor
eight days between Waratuk and
Amatuck-Falls on the Cuyuni river,
and barely escaped from the fever-
ridden jungles with hislife. ,
As his expedition was not equipped
for the severity of the conditions in

~ “A "successful failure” "is the Over?‘

British Guiana, Dr. Williams stated
that his trip was not altogether. a
failure, for he took barometric read-
ings,‘checked from ‘an ecological’ or
environmental standpoint, the insect
life of thé district at eight different
points and found a distinct group of
beetles which began to approximate
in classto those of the "Southern
United States and Central‘ America.

Dr. Williams expected to pene-
trate the interior as far as the
plateaus of Kukenaam and Roraima,

Doyle’s “Lost World,” but he was
glad to reach Georgetown safely.
He brought back thousands of "speci-
cludin

CURRENT EVENTS

 

ii(Continued from Page 4)

ence rather than to handicap usby
at Court composed of men too old,
over conservative and out of step
with their generation. In fact, at
the present moment the two oldest
members, Justice Holmes, 86, and
Brandeis, '71, are believed by most
people to be more ’liberal than any
other men in the Court. As a di-

ression it may interest some to
earn that Justice Holmes is the son
of the poet and that he was wounded
in action in the Civil War when he
was a volunteer in the ranks of the
North.

__ For some reason it seems that
older men can continue to render
actively useful service on the bench
to a greater degree than is possible
in other activities of life. . Rarely _do
we ﬁnd executives either in business
or government who remain active
long after 65 or 70 at the most. Of
course, many exceptions can be cited.
The late Mr. Gary of the United
States Steel Corporation is one.
President von Hindenburg of the
German Republic is another. He
recently observed his 80th birthday
anniversary. Clemenceau “the tiger
of France” is now 86 and although
at the present time in retirement, he
was active in French politics and
administration until he was about 80.
But these men are -the exceptions
rather than the rule.

The Presidency of the United
States is literally a man-killing job.
Its vast responsibilities caused the
physical breakdown of Mr. Cool-
i_dge’s two immediate predecessors.
That President Coolidge has endured
_the strain so well, is doubtless due
in part to his temperament‘ as ‘well’
as to. his age. Yet certainly his
energy has remained greater and the
sapping of his vitality has been less
than would have been the case if he
were ten ' to ﬁfteen years older.
When he waselected in 1924 he was
ﬁfty-two’ years of age.

~ It is perhaps because he so well‘
understands the ordeal of the presi-
dency that Mr. Hughes has implied
that he may now be too old for that
oiiice. If he should be nominated
and elected in 1928 he would be
seventy years old before his term of
oﬂice expired. He was born in 1862.
Even if under such circumstances a
man should find his health unim-
paired at the end of four years, it
would be almost out of the question
for him to be a candidate for another
term after he had ‘passed 70. As
the party in power prefers to have
as itspresidential candidate a man
who has just completed a successful
term, the nominee for the ﬁrst term
is more likely to be near sixty than
seventy and preferably he would be
under sixty rather over it. Mr.
Lowden is one year older than Mr.
Hughes as he is now 66. Mr. Dawes"

- is 62. Mr. Hoover is 53. Governor

Ritchie of Maryland is
crnor Smith, 54. o

It interested me to see recently a
statement that for the second time
in its existence the Senate of Can-
ada had celebrated the birthday of
a.‘ Senator - who. had achieved one
hundred years. The statement con-
tinued that at the present time in
addition to the«Senator 100 years old
the Canadian Senate includes a'_Sen--
ator of 90, six past eighty and ‘a
number past seventy. Ofcourse this

51 and Gov-

"is due to the fact that Canadian"

Senators are appointed for life.

. Morrow to Mexico _ _ .
The appointment of Mr.ji Dwight

’Morrow by President Coolidge as

Ambassador to Mexico has aroused

I ‘speculation as to whether the Sen-

ate will approve as Ambassador. a.
man who was a member of the ﬁrm
of J. P. Morgan and Company which
firm has handled the ’funded‘e'xternal
debt of Mexico, the country to. which
he is. appointed. The Senate'is,not
in session but the comment of in-‘.
dividual Senators indicates that the
appointment‘ of Mr.— Morrow_ will
probably be approved. ‘ Senator
Borah, the Chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee has said “If
Mr...Morr_ow is going to_Mexico to
carry out a policy. of friendly co-
operation, a policy looking to the

laidjustment of our controversy with
, Mexico upon -peaceful and justlines ,
 -and with due regard for the rights

ofall, parties, I think’ he is in a po-
sition to render a public service of
incaalculable value.” Mr. Brisbane of
the. Hearst staff made the comment

 th;atjt_o “most men it would be easier
toj.';resi'gn‘an ambassadorship‘ to en'-
;.ai5par-t,nership in J. P. Morgan

a1.n’di{Company than to resign _,from
1’ ‘ .0:  Wt icoepanr t°f 3;;

   

time the Senate passes upon Mr.
'Morrow’s appointment he will have
been in oﬂice for at least two
months. In that period he should
dempnstrate his capacity and eﬁ‘ec-
tiveness or the lack of it, to the de-
gree that approval by the Senate can
be made or withheld upon his record
in Mexico rather than upon his for-
mer corporation aﬂiliations.

In September I called upon Mr.
Morrow .in his oﬂice in order to ex-
tend to him an invitation to speak
in Pittsburgh next week. He stated
that his plans for e immediate fu-
ture were so dependent upon certain
undecided matters that“. it was impos-
sible for him to commit himself to
the date suggested. President Cool-

idge’s announcement makes evident

what the “undecided matters” prob-
ably were.

The diplomatic relations between
our country and Mexico have been
delicate for a long time. At the
present time the controversy be-
tween the two governments makes
it imperative that we should be rep-"
resented in Mexico by a man of the
ablest type whose attitude toward
controversy is judicial rather than
partisan. It has been said “there
are three sides to every question-—

your side, my side, and the truth.”

It is the business of diplomats
through discussion to arrive at fact.
It was Canning, I believe, who de-
ﬁned a diplomat as “a gentleman
who is. sent abroad to lie for his
country.” Diplomacy of that type is
passing. The United States wants
no special privilege in the world be-
cause of her strength and wealth.
She should be and I am -sure is will-
ing to rest her case anytime, any-
where upon its merits, impartially
considered.
Mexico accompanied by the hopes
of all citizens that he can be of serv-
ice’ in resolving the troubled situa-
tion which hastoo long existed be-
tween the United States and that
country. *

In the message presented to the
Mexican Congress last month by the
President of Mexico (Calles) there
was special comment made concern-
ing the relations between Mexico and
this nation. Our State department
has announced the signing of a con-
vention between the two countries
which extends the life of the Gen-
eral Claims Commission for a period
not exceeding two years beyond Au-
gust 30, 1927. The Commission de-
clared it impossible to complete the
consideration of all pending cases
unless its existence was extended.
In the last eight weeks this govern-
ment has made several inquiries
about and at least one protest
against the treatment of American
citizens in Mexico. Mr. Morrow has
a man’s size job before him. The
questions in dispute concerning the
petroleum and alien lan.d laws have
not become less acute since the laws
went into effect last January. The
lawswere passed two years ago but
were not to be effective until Janu-
ary, 1927. _

, The Dawes Plan

Before leaving the question of our

relations with other countries I wish-

to- comment upon the operation in
Germany of the Dawes plan. ,To
most citizens of this country the
words ,‘‘The ‘Dawes Plan” suggest
vaguely some arrangement‘ with
Germany for the payment of. repa-
rations. The plan itself seems to
themajority of people to touch. us

_ so remotely as to leave its details

of- small importance and. small in-
terest to us. This is not the case
with the citizens of Germany. The
Dawes plan to them is not remote
but a plan which draws from their
pockets_ annually a sum -of» marks in-
creasing each year until the normal
annual payment of two and one half
billion marks is reached. It is the
business of the Reparations Agent’
to see to it that Germany ‘continues
to; pay within her capacity and with-
in the provisions of the plan. It is
his duty to inform the creditor gov-
ernment of any hardship upon Ger-
many affecting her business adverse-
ly or her solvency, due to the collec-
tion of payments beyond her ca-
pacity.

The theory of the Dawes plan" is.

not to kill the goose that lays the
golden egg -but rather to secure the

Mr. Morrow goes to

jury. There is no indication so far,
at least as the creditor nations see
it, that the Dawes plan is working
_an unreasonable hardship upon Ger-
many. Some _Gernian opinion is not
in agreement with the last state-
ment. Whether modiﬁcations in the
planﬂwill‘ have to be made in the
future when through it maximum
‘amounts are being-collected-—-time
alone can tell. The German liberal
point of view is expressed in an
article entitled “Where Do .We
Stand” which appears in the Living
Age of October ﬁrst. _ 

The time at my disposal does not
permit me to give a full'dis’cu_ssion
of all the questions. .of immediate
interest‘ and importance. I wish to
call‘ your attention to two questions
each of which I hope to discuss more
fully some time in this series of
talks. The ﬁrst of these questions
is the one which relates to the prin-
ciple which shall be followed in es-
tablishing the valuation of railroads
for the purpose of rate making. The
capital sum’ involved is greater than
the national debt. The decision is
certain to affect the cost of living one
way or the other and becausexof its
effect upon commodity prices it
should be of interest- to anyone who
concerns himself about what a dollar
will buy.» The case was decided by
the Interstate Commerce Commission
against the railroads. The Commis-
sion‘-declared that the prope,~r basis
for valuation was‘ “original:. cost”

current prices. E - .

The case went before the Court of
Appeals in Kansas City last week.
It is certain to reach the Supreme
Court of the United States eventual-
ly. It will be an interesting case
to observe as it progresses to the
Supreme Court, for it represents im-
portant legal ‘questions, -economic
questions touching twenty billion dol-
lars worthof property, questions of
governmental control over public
utilities and finally questions touch-
ing the purse of every consumer of
goods. The Outlook of October ﬁfth
contains an account of thehearing
before the Interstate“
Commission and gives a summary of
the arguments presented by the at-
torney represen.ti’ng the case against
the railroads. The article observes
that the railroads and public utility
corporations were represented by one
hundred ﬁfty or more lawyers. The
opposition was ‘represented by_ one
man. The‘ Commission accepted his
point of view by a six to fourfvote.
The ﬁnal decision must be one-which
strikes a judicial balance in the
reaching of. which the proper inter-
ests of capital invested in the rail-
roads are considered and a fair ‘meth-
od of valuation is established. While
the case is of concern to all rail-
roads, the only road immediately af-

-& O’Fallon. The case is important
because it is a test case of the Trans-
portation Act (1920).
‘ Farm-Relief Legislation

The second question which will be
more fully discussed later is the ques-
tion of farm-relief legislation‘- This
question is much older than the Me-

much discussion has‘ centered in the
past year." It is an economic: ques-
tion which touches farmers ‘every-
where, and eventually all consumers.
As is so frequently the case however,
it has become arquestioni of import-
ance politically. ‘President Coolidge.

1 In an article in the New I.-York
Times of October 9th there is at-
tributed to the Secretary of Agricul-
ture, Mr. Jardine, a-programof re-
lief to meet the rural situation. The
article, by Mr. L. C." Speers, consists
largely of direct quotations repre-
senting Mr. Jardine’s,opinions con-
cerning farm problems and their so-
lution. Mr. Jardine discusses rural
migration, group bargaining power,
the -value of land and buildings, liv-
ing standards, freight and middle-
men, and eﬂiciency. ‘ He suggests four
things. Here I quote directly from’
the article by Mr. Speers. . _ , ’

fluctuations in agriculture is as fol-
lows:
Jardine‘s Program

“First. The organization of farm-
ers along commodity lines. The ul-
timate object is to helpfarmers at-
tain better bargaining power through
c’o-operative. business organization
‘built from the bottom up.’ Farmers
have next to nothing to say about
the price of their products. Acting
together, they might have a great
deal to say, if they would he says,
‘forget any petty quarrel between
local leaders and organizations and
federate tliei? locals into regional and
national organizations capable of
handling large volumes of business.’

“Second. Recognition of the re-
sponsibility of the public in helping
farmers to reduce the price fluctua-
tions resulting from unavoidable sur-
pluses and shortages, and to adjust
production to demand. The farmer
cannot avoid a. surplus due to ex-
ceptionally favorable weather, and'a
surplus should not be permitted to
depress the price to a point where
‘the farmer in effect not only receives
no additional returns from this sur-
plus, but is obliged to pay for the
privilege of giving it away.’

“Secretary Jardine proposes that
this responsibility should be recog-
nized by creating a Federal Farm
Board clothed with broad legal au-
thority. But he would’_not put the
Government into the business of buy-
ing and selling farm products...

“Third. Economic research as a
basis fora strong statistical service
to enable the Farm Board, individual
farmers and their business. organi-
zations to judge more accurately
present and future conditions of sup-
ply and demand; and to adjust pro-
duction to demand; Research hear-
ing specifically on the problem of
stabilizing the farm prices is urged
as a major part of the prop'osedvpro-
gram. The Secretary says: ‘

“ ‘It is a proper function of Gov-
ernment to provide the facts with
the proper interpretation made avail-
able to all, to serve as a guide for
the future.” . .

“Fourth. Public credit in the form
of a revolving fund administered by
the Farm Board for the -purpose of
holding a part of the crop from
season to season, or from one year
to the next, to reduce fluctuations in
price. ‘ The revolving fund is not pro-
posed as a gift in disguise, but as
a loan.” A .

While Mr. Jardine is not speaking
oﬂicially for the administration, it
seems but probable that the views
he has expressed may be a close
approach tothose of the President.
In any case, the Congressional Rec-
ord, once Congress convenes, will ﬁnd
itself ﬁlled with even more than the
usual discussion of farmersand their
welfare. _

The Feminist Movement ’

Recently there has been a revival
of discussion of women’s clubs, the
feminist movement, the new woman
and in general of views both for-‘and
against feminism. The October Cen-
tury has as one of its. leading articles
one entitled “A Clubless Woman’s
World.” The ' author, Ida Clyde
Clarke, believes that the Woman’s
club, movement is slowing down.
While she believes thatthe Woman’s
club as an institution will continue,
she thinks that by 1950 itwill be so
changed as to be scarcely recog-
nizable. ,. '

w The October Harpers carries an
article‘ entitled‘ ”Fen1inism‘-—New
Style,” by Dorothy Bromley. She
believes that only" a few women have
proved the capacity and the creative
power of , the ‘feminine mind‘ and" that

‘the modern womaninterepsts herself

inlaicareer or a job inspite of the"
fact“ that “she doubts the quality and
date.” .Women are sensing that they
no more than men “can. resist the
mentally demoralizing effects of idle-
ness.” Many women discover this
fact too late, after their children are
grownand the acute need‘ for them
in» the home has disappeared. By
this time the ﬁnding ofa jobwhich,

"will fit, has frequently become im-

possible in a ﬁeld "where straight
thinking is the requireinent_. The
article maintains that the modern
woman has not become “hostile to
-the other sex in the course-of‘ her
struggle to orient herself,” that she
“professes no loyalty to women en
masse,’’ that ‘.‘free love’’ . . . is
impractical rather than unmoral,”

-that “a husband and children are

necessary to the average Woman’s.
fullest _ development,” that there
must be “more freedom and honesty
with in the marriage relatio_n.”
Finally .the_articlej state-S ‘fthat men’
and children shall no longer circum-
scribe her world, although they may

zstoggy " is‘,

not content withone article-lon.lFem-9

inism, but with characteristic thor-
oughness submits eight. The eight
authors are well known people.
Among them are Mrs. Catt, Charlotte-
Perkins‘Gilman, and Dr. Joseph Col-
lins; a New York neurologist. . Five
of the articles are by women and
three by men. The titles of the eight
articles show the wide, range of ma-
terial discussed. . - A

“Woman Suffrage Only an Epi-
sode in Age-Old Movement.”

“Women’s Achievement Singe the
Franchise.” A .

“The New Woman in the Making.”

“Woman’s Encroachment on Man’s
Domain.”. i, ~

_“The Highway to Woman’s Hap-
piness.” ~ *

“Evils of Woman’s Revolt Against
the Old Standard.”

“Woman’s Morality in Transition.”

“Frenchwomen’s Lack of Political
Progress.” _

Like’ the Editors of Current His-
tory, I hasten to state that I take
no sides in this controversy. There
is, as they say, “no aspectof present
day social history more controversial
in character or more delicate in its
implications than that of the new
status of Woman.” Many of the
statements in these articles will
prove quite startling to the person
who is not in touch with the prob-
lems of feminism. The article by
Dr. Joseph Collins is especially in-
teresting, for to quote him he is dis-
cussing “what is likely to be the re-
sult of the advent and activities of
the New Woman; what the effects of

-the dissemination of the ideas and

conceptions for whichshe is held re-
sponsible will be on morals, manners,
marriage, and man.” One cannot es-
cape the rythm of those ﬁnal allitera-
tive words, “morals, manners, mar-
riage and man.” He giveshis prog-
nosis. One may take it or leave it.

The ten articles on feminism in
the October magazines to which I
havegreferred, represent only a frac-
tional part of the current writing
on that subject. .

There is one annual event of na-
tional interest which is held in
Pittsburgh. I refer to the Inter-
national Art Exhibition which opens
tomorrow and closes on December
the fourth. The interest in this ex-
hibition, as measured by_ attendance
and by discussion of it, has been
constantly increasing. The Exhibi-
tion endeavors to show characteristic

_modern paintings of the various na-

tions. The selection of paintings has
been on the basis of securing for the
exhibit those paintings whichshow a
cross section of art. as it is today
throughout the world. Because of
that fact the modernist schools are
certain to be fairly represented.
President Coolidge and his party will
havea private‘ view of the paintings
tomorrow.‘ The President is coming
to Pittsburgh to. give the Founder’s
day address for Carnegie Institute.
Diplomats who will arrive with the
presidential party include the
French, Italian and Rumanian am-
bassadors, the Minister from. the
Netherlands and the Charge d’
affaires from Belgium. These vari-

ous countries are represented’ in the '

exhibition of paintings. iSecretary
of the Treasury, Mr. A. W. Mellon
and Secretary of Labor, Mr. James
J. Davis, both of whom are Pitts-
burghers will accompany President
and Mrs. Coolidge to this city.
