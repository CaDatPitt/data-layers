Thousands gather
for Greek food, fun

Shaler resident Nubia Habay
spoon—fed her son Blake while she
waited for her husband to return to
the table. Blake seemed pleased with
strained peas, but his mother had
pastitsio, dolmathes and baklava on
her mind.

“I saw the sign on the Ninth
Street Bridge,” she said. “I’ve been to
Greece recently and I love the food
there, so I thought we’d stop by.”

The Habays, along with hundreds
of others, decided to spend their
Sunday afternoon at the 42nd annual
St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox
Cathedral Greek Food Festival.

“This year, we celebrate the
patrons who have been cominghere
for years,”.said Father Sarantos
Serviou, who has been saying Massat
St. Nicholas for the past 25 years.

He knows families that have come

every year since the festival began,
and he said their devotion and sup-
port have meant a lot to the Church.

In addition to providing authentic
Greek foods such as moussaka (a
sauteed beef and eggplant casserole)
and souzoukakia (Greek meatballs),
the festival features nightly tradition-
al dance performances and tours of
the Cathedral conducted by Serviou.

Because the bishop of Pittsburgh,
Metropolitan Maximos, does not
favor church—sponsored rafﬂes or
bingo, the food festival serves as St.
Nicholas’ main fundraiser. According
to Serviou, the week—1ong festival
draws 20 to 25 thousand people each
year and raises as much as $150,000
for the church. Church leaders ‘use the
money to sponsor activities like
Sunday school, dance classes and the

marathon

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

Two years ago, Pitt student Amanda lllar V
ran the last four miles of the Pittsburgh
marathon as part of a relay team. As she ran
past mile marker 24 among the many people
who began at the starting line, she felt as ’
though she didn’t belong with them.’

“I just didn’t feel right only running four
miles,” she said.

i That moment inspired her to run the
entire race. .

lllar was supposed to run in her first
marathon last year, but a broken foot kept
her from participating in the Pittsburgh
Marathon. She was determined to make it
through the race thisyear, though.

“I’m not a real fast runner,” she said. “I
just thought it would be cool.’’

Pitt students Ian Ehrlich and Juha
Edwards also ran in this year’s marathon,
which passed through Oakland around mile
12. Ehrlich started running last year, while

Edwards said she ran cross-country in high

school and competed in last year’s marathon.
Unlike many other participants, lllar said

she had not trained extensively for the run,

which was held on Sunday morning, May 4.

' She said she had nm a few times for about

an hour and once for two hours but, beyond
that, she did not train for the nearly ﬁve and
a half hours of running she needed to com-
plete the 26.2 mile marathon.

“Really, I don’t know how I am still
walking,” she said two days after the race.

Ehrhch said, during the past four
months, he ran about 50 miles a week, and
his longest run before the marathon was 22
miles. But many of those runs were done on
dirt—not pavement—~because the dirt was
easier on his knees.

Ehrhch’s training style may have hurt
his marathon time, he said. He wanted to try
to nm the marathon within four hours, but he
hurt his ankle and knee while running on the
street and had to hmp the last ten miles to
the ﬁnish line —- bringing his ﬁnishing time
closer to ﬁve hours,

It took lllar ﬁve hours and 27 minutes to
ﬁnish the race, she said. The ﬁrst 16 miles
were the easiest because she was running
with her dad and had someone with whom

Wife of former Egyptian
president encourages young
women, hopes for peace I

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

Madame J ehan Sadat watched as
her husband was shot down several feet
in front of her. She saw people through-
out her country of Egypt suffering from
war and poverty, and she continues to
watch violence ravage the Middle East.

In spite of this, she still believes in
peace.

Madame Sadat, the wife of former
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, spoke
at the Carnegie Music Hall Thursday
night, April 24. President Sadat served
in Egypt from 1970 until 1981 and
received the Nobel Prize for Peace for
his work in orchestrating the Egyptian
peace treaty with Israel in 1979.

“War is terrible and war is suffering
and destruction of the highest degree,”
Madame Sadat said. “Although I hate
war, you would think me a hypocrite if
I‘ stood before you tonight condemning
all war and the leaders who send their
young men [to ﬁght].”

Madame Sadat addressed an audi-
ence composed largely of students from
The Ellis School, an independent prep
school for women in Pittsburgh and
surrounding areas that sponsored the
event.

Warning students in the audience to
look at the reasons behind the conﬂict
in Iraq before following the anti-war
reactions popular among movie stars
and powerful people, Madame Sadat
drew parallels between America’s cur-
rent war and the conﬂicts her husband
faced during his time in office.

“In this modern age of modern
communication, young people and even
adults can mistake celebrity for
courage, money for inﬂuence,”
Madame Sadat said. “All of us are
against oppression, against terrorism,
against war. The decision to go to war
was the hardest my husband ever had to
make because he knew how many lives
would be lost or changed forever
because of injury.”

“The Iraqi people have suffered—
they deserve their freedom and democ-
racy,” Madame Sadat said. “My heart is
aching for those who have lost loved
ones in this war. No war, regardless of

4 its swiftness or accuracy in execution,

is without joy when it ends.”

 

“It is difﬁcult toconceive that any-

one would turn the tide of war into a
wave of peace, but this is what my hus-
band did,” Madame Sadat said. “He
would never compromise on whether or
not there would be peace—he’d com-

, promise on ways to achieve it.” .

As a woman who returned to
school at the, age of forty, attending a
university where three of her four chil-
dren were also enrolled, Madame Sadat
offered her life as an example of a suc-
cessful combination of roles as mother,
wife, member of the community and
active leader. ’ A

“Why must we feel they must give _
up the joys of motherhood to have
careers?’ Madame Sadat asked. “Men
and women must work together for the
advancement of their society. Egypt
will never be able to provide for its 70
million citizens without 100 percent of
its women involved.”

Madame Sadat urged the audience,
particularly the young women at The
Ellis School, to take an active interest
in the treatment of women in America
and the world;

“I bet that the majority of the peo-
ple in this world do care about each
other—they simply don’t know what to
do to make things better.”

While Madame Sadat achieved
many of her goals to assist struggling
women and children in Egypt and in
the world, she expressed more frustra-
tion about the continuing strife among
Middle Eastern nations.

“I thought by now that the people
in my part of the world would be living
side by side. I also hoped that poverty
and war would be remnants of the
past,” Madame Sadat said, recalling her
idealism as a young woman. '

Recalling the role America played
during the Carter administration in
helping President Sadat, Madame Sadat
emphasized the importance of
American and Western support in
achieving a peaceful resolution.

“Bulldozers and tanks will not give
a feeling of security to Israel. Suicide
bombers will not give freedom, inde-
pendence and dignity to Palestine,”
Madame Sadat said. “Mutual respect,
along with a sense of general trust and
understanding, must be established
between the East and the West.”

ioner volunteers like George
Yanulis staff the festival.

“I think they’ve done an excel-
lent job,” said Yanulis, a relatively
new member among the mostly
older, inner-city parishioners. “And
they seem to be getting more and
more people each year.”

Every year, preparation for the

festival begins in January, after the A

Epiphany, when church members
purchase only the highest quality

. of food from local vendors,

Serviou said. Parishioners cook the
food and store it in a room-sized
freezer until two weeks before” the

in the rear of the room but left
enough space to accommodate the
dancers. The rest of the room was
devoted to seating, which was at a_
premium during the festival.

“The food here is very good,
excellent,” Nubia Habay said, still
shoveling Gerber into Blake’s
mouth. “I wish they had this more
often.”

Serviou said the festival is
much more thana fundraiser——it is
an opportunity for people to come
together in a “fellowship of
warmth and Greek spirit.”

“This is a very large communi-
ty event, which has become an
institution in Pittsburgh,” he said.

The festival continues all this
week until Friday, May 9. Lunch is
available‘ from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and dinner is served from 5 to 9
p.m. until Thursday. On Friday,
dinner hours are 4 p.m. to 10 pm.

The festivities officially end at 1

After that, her dad needed to keep
running to prevent his knees from getting
stiff, while she needed to walk for some
of the time to ﬁght off muscle cramps.

Like other runners, lllar described
the ﬁnal few miles as the toughest.

“I think miles 22 and 23 took forev-
er,” she said. “You were not quite done,
but still a lot [was] done.”

As she approached the ﬁnal miles .
and saw Heinz Field —- the ﬁnishing line
— in the distance, she wished someone
else could come and take her place, but
she said she knew she was the only one
who could ﬁnish it.

According to Edwards, though, the
toughest part of the rim came a bit earlier
than mile 22 or 23.

“[At miles] 18 and 19, all of your
body cramps up and your mind goes all
delirious,” ‘she said. But she added that,
by mile 24, she had regained all of her
strength.

Ehrlich and Edwards both said they
are looking into rimning another
marathon. 1

Edwards said she might run in the

Columbus, Ohio marathon, which should ,

be easier because it won’t have as many
hills as Pittsburgh.

Illar has no plans on running a “'
marathon again soon, but she said next

year she will probably be running again.

Boehm answers Pederson’s, Nebraska’s call

After nearly ﬁve months as Pitt s
interim athletics director, Marc
Boehm announced his plans to leave
Pitt for the University of Nebraska.
He 11 be serving under Steve
Pederson as executive associate ath-
letic director there, effective June 1.

He was the only person being
considered to replace Pederson as
athletics director. As an interim, his
actions included hiring new men s
and women s basketball coaches.

He clearly displayed a passion
for the job and a love of Pitt. He was
clearly the right man for the job and
Pitt let him slip through their ﬁngers.

Who can blame him for leaving?

Nebraska offered him an actual
job, a position created by Pederson
for the sole purpose of enticing
Boehm to join him.

Pitt, on the other hand, has been
letting Boehm ﬁx our coaching situa-
tions without so much as making him
a formal job offer. We ve let him
labor along under the murky title of

interim with no end in sight,
despite not interviewing or even
naming any other candidates.

After being kept on hold for so
long, Boehm was right to hang up on
us when another school came calling.

Boehm said, in a press release,
that Chancellor Nordenberg asked
him to reconsider his decision to
withdraw his name from the running

for Pitts athletics director. Boehm s
decision, however, was practically a
non-decision. He chose to accept an
actual position rather than be strung
along indefinitely where s the

choice in that? A

Both Pederson and Boehm cited
their Midwestern roots as reasons for
returning to Nebraska. It s true
there s no place like home and
Pederson made no bones about want-
ing to return. Boehm was a different
story.

Sure, heading back to Nebraska, -
near his extended family, and work-
ing with Pederson again were nice
bonuses, but so would have been a
contract or a little job security here
at Pitt. Perhaps, had these been
options, Nebraska might not have
seemed so attractive, but we 11 never
know.

Kudos to Boehm for bucking
Pitts trend of leaving positions up in
the air for long periods, then simply ,
dropping the interim from the job
title.

It s too bad we had to lose such a
capable, well-liked man. Maybe now
Pitt will realize the athletics depart-
ment needs support to survive.

And how interesting that
Nordenberg, an interim chancellor
for nearly a year himself before
being named to the post, wanted
Boehm to hang on just a little longer.

What “Buffy” hath wrought: the new face of fandom

Six months ago, I wrote about “Maxim,” a male-
oriented magazine that I, a female, enjoy. _When I
tell people I read Maxim, A
they respond by looking at
me cockeyed and backing
away, as if I’ve told them
that Geoffrey the Toys ‘R Us
giraffe was munching peyote
behind them.

Revealing ‘my fannish-
ness — my obsessive love of
all things Buffy and X-Men
— draws a somewhat similar
reaction. One of my friends,
while discussing the little
wink-wink, nudge-nudge fan moments included in
X2: X-Men United, said, “Why Sydney, I had no _
idea,” when I mentioned that I had been monitoring
various Web sites for spoilers — hints either
dropped by the studio or collected by fans about a
unreleased project, in this case a movie.

His genuine surprise struck me. I had kept most
of my farmishness in the closet, along with my 42
pairs of shoes, because, well, I was afraid of being
judged.

Consider the stereotypical image of a Trekkie -
mid-twenties, single, white male with adult acne and
no social skills. Star Trek, one "of the ﬁrst fandoms,
is archetypical of the fan experience.

It’s a huge fandom — covering several TV series
and movies, and incorporating hundreds of thou-
sands of fans. They attend conventions, circulate fan
‘zines and memorize minutiae. Still, fandom was ,
seen as a fringe activity and its adherents as

deviants, however harmless. '

It was also ma1e—dorninated, and fangirls were
the exception rather than the rule. This makes sense,
given that there were few TV shows or comics with
a strong female protagonist, with Wonder Woman as
one of the few beacons in the long darkness.

Two things changed fandom, particularly for '
women —- the advent and increased popularity of the
Internet, and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” The first
allowed fandom to, in a sense,’ go public. It emerged
from the convention halls of hotels and back areas of
comic book shops like some waking beast blinking
in the sun after 60 years of hibernation. Its message:
“We’re here. We’re dorks. Get used to it.”

But even the anonymous nature of the Internet
could not deconstruct the glass ceilings and walls
segregating gender. Women were far outnumbered.

There was the occasional girl who surmounted

the social convention dictating that girls read Nancy .

Drew while boys read comics, and the fannish
assumption that girls were somehow ill-equipped to
discus the finer points of Marvel Comics.

Then came “Buffy.” Though the feminist move-
ment extended to science ﬁction, “Buffy” was the
ﬁrst to merge it fully with fandom. Not without pre-
decessors — indeed Buffy could look to Dana Scully
as her foremother and Emma Peele as her patron
saint —— there’s no doubt that Buffy, both the charac-
ter and the show, changed things.

0 One Web site posits that “Buffy” is “the fandom
that ate everything,” meaning that it left most other
fandoms in its wake.Because it was my first brush
with fandom, I can’t say what the fan world was like
pre-“Buffy.” But I can say that its pervasiveness

(232,000 hits for “Buffy + fan” on google.com) and
its rabidly attentive fan-base, along with critics laud-
ing the show as intelligent, sexy and feminist, make
it one of the biggest and best-known fandoms. _g

Suddenly the gates to fandom were blown apart.
Women began ﬂocking to fandom. Being a fangirl
isn’t something shameful — it has its own language,
celebrities and conventions. 

My former roommate —- a popular cheerleader in
high school and an ardent Trekkie and Buffy fan —
could express her love for high kicks and Patrick
Stewart. .

Still, walls between fandom and society remain.
Recently, one of my classmates used a fannish term
to describe mainstream ﬁction. Met with stares, she
attempted to explain. The more she spoke, the more
the class turned away from her; her language erected
an invisible wall, driving fan from non-fan. ‘

As her voice grew more nervous, and the class’s
silence more pronounced, I‘ was faced with a deci-
sion — speak up and come out“ of the fannish closet,
or avoid self—incrimination and take the fifth.

I chose the latter, butgregret doing so. I chose it
because fandom may be gaining acceptance, but my
classmates’ conderrming silence indicates that it has

I" not been accepted fully. The message: It’s okay to be

a fan, so long as you keep it at home.

As a closet fangirl, I can pass in either world.
But for now, here is my apology to all fangirls cur-
rent and past, and my proclamation to the world: I’m.
here. I’m a girl and a dork and a fan. Get used to it.

Nordenberg should name Mr.

Panther new athletics director

Chancellor Nordenberg: So, Mr. Panther,
it says here on your resume that you 0
have no experience in administration.
How do you plan to execute the duties of
the athletics director position without
any prior knowledge of such positions?

Bronze Panther: Well, it’s true that I’ve
never been in upper administration
before, but I still think I can do the job. I
mean, I have tons of experience being a
symbol and inspiring people. Plus, the
way I ﬁgure, you’ve got to be rtmning
out of people with experience by this
point anyway. Can beggars really be
choosers?

CN: Well, it is true thatwe are getting
pretty far down the ladder in athletics.
And I suppose you do have deep roots at
Pitt. “ ,

BP: I’ve been here since the school start-
ed the athletics program. Now thatis
seniority» for you. Plus, I’m anchored into
the ground by $10,000 of imported rock,
and if those aren’t roots I don’t know
what are.

CN: What We’re really looking for,
though, is someone who will stick
around even if we keep them in the dark

about their job status or make them feel
unappreciated. V

BP: Did I mention the tons of stone
under me? And
if you want
someone who
can take abuse,
I’m your cat.
Have you seen
the ridiculous 0
things those

   

 V V A students do to
Greg Heller-LaBelle me?
Editor in Chief CN: Fm glad
you brought the

students up. We don’t want anyone that’s
going to be more loyal tothem than to
us. We know you have a history of living
among them. If hired, can you assure us
that you’re legitimately on the right side?

BP: If they’d been jumping on your back
for two years, you wouldn’t ask that.

CN: Five years for me, but no matter.
Yes, but are you any good at ftmdrais-
ing? This problem isn’t exactly limited to
athletics. I mean, we’ve had to hire jani-
tors to institutional advancement posts.

BP: That’s one way to get a living wage.
CN: Seriously.

BP: But to answer your question, yes,
I’ve raised millions of dollars just by
showing my teeth. If you need an animal
that can get you money and stick around,
you’re looking at him. ~

CN: Now, as I’m sure you’re aware,
there have been some recent cases where
‘conduct by athletics ofﬁcials has been
bad for some universities’ PR. What
assurance do _we have that you’ll
behave?

BP: I’m made of cast metal and I’m
stuck in the ground by the aforemen-
tioned rocks.

CN: Yes, but there was that rumor about
you and that Nittany Lion —— '

BP: Hey, that was years ago, and I was
little more than a cub at the time.
Besides, no allegations" were ever con-
firmed. And don’t worry, the Lion was a
female.

CN:‘ Well, that's a relief; the last thing
we need is another beneﬁts case. I have

to say, Mr. Panther, You certainly do
stack up rather well, all things consid-
ered. . . A
BP: Thank you, Chancellor.

CN: Just one thing. Those rocks—you
said they were imported? They’re not _
from Nebraska, by any chance, are they?
BP: No.

CN: Los Angeles?

BP: No.

CN: Duquesne or CMU?

BP: No, sir. They’re from Italy.

CN: Ah, well there’s a relief  Italy 
they don’t have an athletics department
there, do they?

BP: Well, they have an Olympic team, '

. but Pitt is a great place and I’m very

happy here. Trust me, I’m looking for-
'ward to fulﬁlling my contract here at
Pitt. ‘

Remembering
andlivingthe 
lessons ofour

This past Saturday, a memorial service was held for A
Fred Rogers at Heinz Hall. Public Broadcasting System
and Family Communications, lVIr. Rogers’ production
company, televised the memorial to people across the
nation who couldn’t attend but wanted to participate.
What people in attendance and viewers at home experi-
enced was a loving tribute to a person who changed the ‘
lives.of three generations of children.

There were remembrances from many ﬁiends and
neighbors, ranging from Theresa Heinz and Jeffrey
Erlanger, the young, disabled man who appeared on “Mr.
Rogers’ Neighborhood” in the late ’70s in one of the most

, touching moments in that show’s history, to Yo-Yo Ma

and Itzhak Perlman. Ma, via a video message, and

’ Perlman, live, performed for the packed Heinz Hall and

 

Column like we  
see ‘em
Dante A. Ciampaglia

’ ' viewers at home.

What the television audience
didn’t see, but those of us at Heinz
Hall had the unforttmate experience
of witnessing, was a tasteless, dis-
gusting protest across the street where
people were holding signs that read:
“God Hates Fags,” “AIDS is God’s
Curse,” “God Bless 9/1l” and “Fags
Doom Nations.” This behavior is
nothing new for the Westboro Baptist

’ Church, the group who organized the
protest. This is the same organization
that went to the fimeral of Matthew

Shepard, the man who fell victim to a hate crime because

‘A he was gay,.where protestedhim and his lifestyle.

After Mr. Rogers’ death, Westboro crawled from
beneath the rock under which they were hiding and con-
demned him because, they felt, as a Presbyterian minister
he had a responsibility to proclaim the evils of homosexu-
ality, “whoremongery” and adultery. By not doing so, he
would “damn his soul forever in hell.” Previously, Shirley
Phelps-Roper, attorney for Westboro, went further, saying,
“This country has forgotten God and effectively ﬂipped -
him off, and Fred Rogers is in part responsible.”

To say that I wasn’t angered by hearing, reading and
ultimately seeing such lowlifes trying to claim that Mr. V
Rogers, a man who has had such an inﬂuence on my life,
was in part responsible for the downfall of civilization
would be a lie. _

Making my anger worse, one person holding a sign

was a young girl who couldn’t have been more than 12
years old. I stood in front of Heinz Hall dumbfounded.
Doesn’t making your child hold a sign that says “Fags
Doom Nations” somehow constitute child abuse?

I felt like yelling obscenities and (lending their par-
enting skills, heaving heavy chunks of rock at them, tak-
ing their signs and shoving them down their throats, or
worse.

But I didn’t.

I mumbled something about getting a life, walked
-into Heinz Hall, took my seat and talked to my brother for
a bit about how ignorant the protesters were. As the ser-
vice started, my anger and seething resentment melted
‘away. Mr. Rogers wo11ldn’t have approved. I’d forgotten
his lessons about accepting people for who they are, that
every one is special and that it’s OK to be angry but it’s

how you deal with that anger that’s important. By remem~ ’ i

bering these things, Mr. Rogers had helped me let go of
the hatred these hate-mongers were drumming up.

The Fred Rogers Memorial Service was a beautiful
event. I’ll never forget Itzhak Perlman’_s magniﬁcent per- A
formance, Theresa Heinz’s emotional and hea1t-wrench-
ing speech or how sad and emotionally unguarded
Neighbor Aber was when I saw him, sitting in the back
row of the gallery at Heinz Hall at the end of the service.

It’s too bad that the protesters chose to spew the bile
of hatred and intolerance in attempt to belittle a credit to
the human race. Had they chosen not to make themselves
look like buffoons, they wou1d’ve felt what those of us in
Heinz Hall did: being Wrapped in Mr. Rogers’ warm aims
of friendship, love and acceptance.

Who needs school when you

have rock ‘n’ roll?

Burning Brides, My Morning Jacket,

Detachment Kit
May 8, 7 p.m.
Club Laga, $8—$10
(412) 687-4636

Here’s the plan: drop out of school, pack up
the van and drive around the United States
looking for the real rock ‘n’ roll experience
along with your bassist girlfriend and pocket
full of grungy tunes. Such aspirations are surely
shared by a vast army of guitar-toting, frizzy—
haired rockers. Unlike most of them, Dimitri
Coats’ plans look as though they might just pan

out.

In fact, the most interesting thing about the
Burning Brides, a Philadelphia three—piece led
by Coats, is their unyielding momentum. After
spending a few hard years on the road, V2
Records — see: White Stripes, Moby —
scooped up the band’s debut, Fall of the Plastic

does well within the confines of traditional

rock; so well that they’ve garnered enough ‘

attention to.headline their own tour; Two other
~ notable up-and—coming bands, My Morning

Empire, which was released last September.

Then they were recruited to open for mega-
group Audioslaveon their recent tour.

In short, Burning Brides make boisterous
rock with cutting hooks and hummable chorus
lines. Their sound isn’t revolutionary, but it

C0111’.

Jacket and Detachment Kit, join them on the _

Much like the Burning Brides, My Morning
Jacket is among the inﬂux of talented rockers

recently experiencing success, having signed on
with ATO and RCA records to release their
upcoming LP. _ ' -

— Hailing from Louisville, Kentucky — a

hometown that’s been shared ‘by
the likes of Will Oldham and
Slint — My Morning Jacket’s
distinctiveness lies in their seem-
ingly equal fascination with Neil
Young, Galaxie 500 and Muppet
Movies. _ ' , p '

The result is a unique
brand of country—infused rock
that dabbles in the fantastical.
Such acombination has earned
them attention from both inde-
pendent and mainstream figures,
aswell as given them a solid
stage reputation. ,

This reputation is akin to
that of Detachment Kit, a
Chicago’,-quartet trained in post-
punk and adept in constructing
dark indie pop. Comparisons to
bands like Les Savy Fav and ,
Enon, therefore, have been war-
ranted.

If you’re looking for a
good, cheap time this Thursday,
be sure to make it up to Club

Laga for what will prove to be one of the best

rock shows of the summer.

Rumor has it
Fleetwood Mac is
coming back

Fleetwood Mac

May 10, 8 p.m.

Mellon Arena, $47-$125
(412) 323-1919

For grown-ups and kids alike,
Fleetwood Mac is undoubtedly one
of the most loved musical acts of
the past 50 years. Though most of
their success came in the 1970s
with albums like Fleetwood Mac
and Rumors, they have managed to
sustain a large following of pas-
sionate fans throughout the years
of their existence; fans that will
surely pack the Mellon Arena this
Saturday for their performance.

This tour, unlike most
Fleetwood Mac tours of late, is in
support of a studio album — the
first of theirs in 15 years. In fact,
Say You Will, which was released

'AcA¢¢4;4;ao

D ; u. A'J'.A'A"'~A'4‘A'4 -4'4‘.'a

'o.¢'o'A'A'A‘¢.'

last month on Reprise Records, is
also the Mac’s first venture sans’
Christine McVie, who is one of the
band’s founding members.

Instead, songwriters Stevie
Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham
spearhead the new album equally,
each contributing nine songs to a

_ lengthy eighteen—track record.

Over the years, an astounding
17 different people have rotated in
and out of the band but, this time
around, the band is comprised of
Nicks, Buckingham, John McVie,
and Mick Fleetwood.

Despite much dismemberment
over time, it seems as though the
band has been able to put aside
personal problems in order to focus
on their music during this reunion.

Fortunately for you, the fans,
this will surely transfer to their
live performance. If you can
scrounge up the dough, be sure to
make it out on Saturday to enjoy '
‘one of the most celebrated bands in

the history of rock.

The Good Thief 's2nav1/2

Nick Nolte is so credible as a bumt-
out gambler and heroin junkie that his per-
formance is the reason to see ‘The Good
Thief,” director Neil Jordan’s remake of
the 1955 French ﬁlm “Bob le Flambeur.”

Nolte’s Bob, struggling to stay clean
in Monte Carlo, is out to lift acasino’s art
collection, a task that, naturally, calls for
an elaborate plan and a bunch of plot
twists. He’ll have to dodge a cop who’s
practically hip to the scheme €l‘cheky

Karyo), not to mention a drugged—out waif
(Nutsa Kukhianidze) who seeks his affec-
tion. ,
Jordan bathes the ﬁlm in neon light I
and cigarette smoke and, for his requisite
perversity, tosses in a muscle—bound
female who used to be a man. The director

' seems to be having a lot of ﬁm, but his

ﬁlm is wobbly overall, even with Nolte’s
rock—solid contribution.
—Chad Eberle, staﬁ” writer

Open Hearts are 1/2

At its best, “Open Hearts,” from
Denmark, is an acting showcase akin to ,
Mike Leigh’s ﬁlms of domestic woe. At
its worst, it’s just depressing.

A few lost souls are set in motion by
a car accident — Ceci]ie’s ﬁance,
Joachim, is hit and left paralyzed. He is
deeply embittered by his misfortune and
tries to push Cecilie out of his life. Marie,
the guilt-stricken driver of the car that hit
Joachim, sends her husband Niels to
comfort Cecilie. Cecilie’s grief drives her

into Niels’ arms, starting an affair that I

1‘z‘.I}..I'.\‘.|4‘1.nn;AA.nJ311’ . ; . . . . -.

could destroy his family.

Director Susanne Bier uses the .
Dogme 95 style -— which dictates that
ﬁlmmakers use only natural light, real
locations, and no musical score — to '
greater effect than many who’ve attempt-
edit. This isn’t plush heartbreak; it’s grit-
ty. It’s one for the Ingmar Bergman ’
crowd, those who find there’s something
life—afﬁrming about sadness on screen. If
you’re on board, don’t wait for the ‘
American remake; there won’t be one.

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Continuing a trend that has become
quite familiar, intenm' athletic director Marc
Boehm announced Monday that he will be

V leaving Pitt and returning home to Nebraska

Boehm, who was born in Lincoln, Neb.,
will be taking the position of executive asso-
ciate athletic director and reuniting with
Steve Pederson, who was Pitt’s athletic
director until December and currently holds

. “For more than six years, I Have been
privileged to work with some of the ﬁnest

and most dedicated people at the University ‘

of Pittsburgh,” Boehm -said in a statement
released on Monday. “These past ﬁve
months have been the most rewarding time
of my professional career. Our athletic
department encountered many challenges
and changes during this period, but in each
instance our staﬂ’ responded like champi-
ons.” ' A

Having been appointed to the interim
position after Pederson’s departure, Boehm

oversaw the exit of women’s soccer head‘
coach Roland Sturk, women’s basketball "

coach Traci Waites and_ men’s basketball
coach Ben Howland

Boehm also armounced a new ticket

program for Pitt football and found replace-

ments for all three coaching vacancies.

“Marc Boehm has packed about ﬁve
years worth of experience into his -ﬁve
months of service as our interim athletic
director,” Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said
“For the past several weeks, our principal
focus in athletics has been on recruiting new
men’s ‘and women’s basketball coaches.
Ideally, we might have prefened to ﬁll the
athletic director’s position ﬁrst, but circum-
stances did not permit that”

In early February, Nordenberg appoint-
ed an eight-person committee to help 
ﬁnd Pitt’s next athletic director.

But, after the committee did not inter-
view anyone other than Boehm, it seemed to
be only a matter of time until the “interim”
was removed from his tiﬂe.

At the time that the committee was
formed, Boehm said he was very interested
in the job. '

“I am very passionate and extremely I V

happy here at the University of Pitts ”
he said earlier this year. s ‘

But, despite endorsements from the
committee and Pitt’s coaches and athletic
oﬂicials, Nordenberg never offered Boehm
the position on a permanent basis and, it
appears, Boehm got tired of waiting.

_ “Three weeks ago, I spoke to
Chancellor Nordenberg and withdrew my
name from consideration in the University’s

Pitt lacrosse finishes regular season undefeated

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt attackman Becky Krinsky scored 14 «goals
during the Panthers six-game road trip, in which they
ended the regular season undefeated. But when
Krinsky did not have a big game, her teammates were
able to pick up the slack.

“As a freshman, I think she may have been in the .

top two or three [in scoring] in the league,” head
coach Gary Neft said. “That [somebody stepping up]
happened all year. It was somebody different every
game. We had people stepping up when somebody
else didn’t. That comes from our depth.”

' The Panthers (15-0) road trip included visits to
West Virginia, Michigan State, Toledo, Ball State,
Slippery Rock, and Buffalo. Pitt concluded the regular
season first in its division and tied for second overall
in the league. . A

“[Finishing undefeated] became the goal as we
got closer to it,” Neft said. “After we got out of
February, I think that became the goal.”

. During the stretch, Pitthad a -strong defensive
effort as, on average, it gave up 3.16 goals per game,
and the offense took care of the rest. ‘

“We have a good mixture of veterans and younger

players [on defense] that really came through and
made us balanced.” Neft said.

The Panthers offense averaged 11.5 goals per
game and scored as many as 15 goals in a game dur-
ing the road trip. '

“It’s probably the most that we have ever aver-
aged,” Neft said. “It is the balance; we can go four or
ﬁve deep and not lose anything by going to our subs.”

Pitt 11, West Virginia 2

Krinsky led the way for the visiting Panthers as
she scored four goals in their 11-2 win over West
Virginia.

Denice Dauer was the second-leading scorer of
the game with three goals. Becky Chambers and
Christine Rogers each contributed one goal apiece.
Pitt 8, Michigan State 5

Pitt traveled to Michigan State after taking two
days off and took on the Spartans. The Panthers pulled
out an 8-5 victory behind a strong effort by Jill Ciotta

, and Stephanie Mansueto.

Ciotta and Mansueto each scored two goals in the
contest in which Ciotta also recorded an assist.
Krinsky, Dauer, Chambers and Theresa Bennett also
each scored a goal. Krinsky added two assists while

Dauer and Bennett also contributed an assist each.

Pitt 15, Toledo 2

The road trip continued on to Toledo and so did 5 5  H C

the Panthers’ winning streak. Pitt manhandled the
Rockets —— 15-2 — as Krinsky and Tracy Eisen turned ’
in big performances, scoring three goals apiece.
Shannon House contributed two goals and an
assist. Bennett, Chambers, Dauer, Sandahl Parish,
Maggie Terrell, Laura Thomas and Sarah Woolcoc
also scored goals for the Panthers. »

Pitt 13, Ball State 2
Ball State was the next victim on Pitt’s hit list and
road trip as the Panthers turned in another dominant A
performance with a 13-2 win over the Cardinals.
Again it was Krinsky who was the game’s lead- V
ing scorer with four goals. Ciotta was the Panthers p pr‘
second-leading scorer with two goals. Chambers,
Eisen, Parish, Rogers, Terrell, Susan Natale and Emily
Parton all scored one goal in the contest.

Panthers hire former Georgia Tech head coach Berenato

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Not all Atlantic Coast Conference bas—
ketball coaches think Pitt is not the place to

“We believe the University of
Pittsburgh women’s basketball program has

‘ unlimited potential, and in Agnus Berenato

we have found the perfect person to make

that potential a reality,” Chancellor Mark -

Nordenberg said. “Certainly, with well over

I am getting at the University of Pittsburgh,”
Berenato said. “It is incredible for both
myself and my family and I am anxious
because of the potential that this job has.”

“For too long, we have discussed only
the wonderful possibilities our women’s
basketball program holds at the University
of Pittsburgh,” interim athletic director
Marc Boehm said. “In Agnus Berenato, we
have found the right person to unlock those
possibilities.”

Berenato comes to Pitt from Georgia
Tech, an ACC school, where she was the
head coach of the Yellow Jackets for the
past 15 seasons. While at Georgia Tech, she
set a record for wins by a women’s basket-
ball coach, compiling a 223-209 record.

was some surprise.

However, this year, the surprise was not
how far the former Panthers slid in the draft,
but that they got drafted at all.

Middle linebacker Gerald Hayes, who
some scouts believed to be the best player in
the draft, at his position, was selected in the
third round by the Arizona Cardinals.

, Torrie Cox and Bryan Anderson,
whom scouts were unsure of because both
players are believed to lack the size and-
speed needed at the next level, had to wait
until the later rounds to hear their names
called.

. Cox was selected by Tampa Bay in the
sixth round, while Anderson was picked up
by the Chicago Bears in the seventh round.

Hayes was selected as a second-team
All—American in 2002 and ﬁnished his
career ranked fourth all-time at Pitt with 402
tackles. Hayes is also the ﬁrst Pitt linebacker
to be named All-Big East three times.

Cox, a starter at comerback the last two

. seasons and a standout on special teams, is

the first Pitt player to be drafted by the
Buccaneers since Hugh Green in 1981.

While he saw plenty of action in the
Panthers’ secondary, Cox’s best chance at

teams player. Cox was Pitt’s special teams
Most Valuable Player and special teams
captain the last three seasons and ranked
among the nation’s best with a 20.3 yard
kickoﬁ” return average last season.

A four—year starter at right guard,
Anderson is the second Pitt player drafted
by the Bears in the past two years. Chicago
selected Bryan Knight, who spent last sea-
son as a reserve linebacker, in the 2002
draft.

Last season, Anderson was named
Pitt’s Most Valuable Oﬁensive Lineman
and started 47 of 48 possible games. He
never missed a game during his career at
Pitt.

Harriott named to N agurski watch list

Claude Harriott was named to the 2003
Bronco Nagurski Trophy watch list on
Friday.

Harriott was named to the 36—player list
after turning in an exceptional 2002 season
—he ranked among the nation’s top 25 in
forced fumbles (second) and tackles for loss
(23rd). —
The senior defensive end also lead the
Panthers with 9 1/2 sacks, was named to the
All-Big East ﬁrst team and won the Insight
Bowl’s Defensive Most Valuable Player
award.

Awarded annually to college football’s
best defensive player, the trophy is named
after the Hall of Famer who starred for the
University of Minnesota and the Chicago
Bears.

Harriott is one of 17 returning starters
for a team that ﬁnished 9-4 and ended the
year ranked No. 18 in the country.
