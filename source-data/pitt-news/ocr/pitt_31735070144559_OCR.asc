Pitt's provost the man

. by Kelly Thomas
Staﬂ Writer

The provost has one of the most
important jobs at Pitt, but many people
don’t even know he exists

Provost James V. Maher not only
has to guide academic and research

butalsootganize the resources
needed to complete them.

Maher, a Yale graduate, joined Pitt’s
fa.culty in 1970 as an associate profes-
sor in physics, and he has been with
the University ever since Maher served

in multiple positions both as a nuclear .

physicist and a condensed matter phys-
icist, and was appoinmd as provost in
1994.

Before he became provost, Maher
spent some time as a  professor
in the Netherlands, France, Norway,
Denmark, Germany and Spain do-
ing physics research. Although he said

I _,thelabstaffusuallyspokeEnglishfor

business, he learned some German
in school and picked up French and
Dutch from  long  of
"time in those countiies.
“Once I’m there for a couple of

1 days I’m good by American standards,

but still bad by European standards,”
he said about his  skills
Mahersaidhestillgetstottavelas
provost, but mostiy to Pitt’s regional
campuses, which report  to him.
.-In December he traveled to Brussels
with the European Union_ Center to
discuss education and science policy
“One of the rare  aboutPro—
vost Maher is the scope to transform
ﬁom  a nuclear physicist to a
condensed matter physicist and make
conttibutions in both [ﬁelds] ,’ ’ said Alec
‘Stewart, a fellow condensed matter
physicist and current dean of the Uni-
versity Honors College
“TheNo2guyisalwaysinthe
shadow,” continued Stewart “It’s kind
oflikebeingthe defensive coach on the
football team. He wins games but no
one knows.” J J
Stewart described the provost as
a modest man more concerned with
human achievemmt than personal ad-

“I think that’s the kind of person

behind the University

you need for a leader, someone who

doesn’t run around complimenting
himself all the time,’ ’ said Stewart
Kathy Humphrey, vice provost and
clean of students, agreed that Maher’s
priorities are  Pitt the best it can
be  and  the stu-
dent experience outside the classroom.
“He’s rmlly concerned thatwe don’t
become complacent in the strides that

J we’ve made,’ ’ said Humphrey.

As provost, Maher mugt ensure
that each school meets certain educa-
tional goals it set for itself in previous
years EveryMarch1,eachschoolgives
the provost a ﬁve-year plan with goals
and  it wants to change and one-
Yearbvdget a

“Every one of our schools has a
plantobeasgoodasitcanbe,” said
Maher.

The schools also submit an up-
dated report on which goals they have
achieved and whidt they havaft: Two
months later, Maher meets with his
senior staff to discuss the plans and

' the directions the schools have set for

themselves

Then, Maher  to write long,

“If Fve gotamajorissue thatI just needto talk

' Pa. has no need to

change seatbelt policy

You don’t have to drive far to
see a sign that says, “Buckle up it’s
the law” In Pennsylvania, drivers are
ticketed for not  a seatbelt
only after they’re pulled over for a
separate offense But Pennsylvania is
among 15 states that are considering
making seatbelt violations a primary
enforcement law: In other words, po-
lice would have the authority to ticket
drivers solely for declining to wear a
seatbelt.

Rep. Bob Godshall, R-Mont—‘

gomery, is sponsoring a proposal to
elevate seatbelt enforcement to the
primary enforcement level, according
to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review

Should Pennsylvania adopt this
policy before July, the state would be
eligible to receive millions from the
federal government. Although it’s
not clear how much money Perm-
sylvania would get, the state could
only spend the additional funds on
highway-related projects.

There’s no question that seatbelts
reduce the mortality rates of car acci-
dents. To put it plainly, seatbelts save
lives Due to their effectiveness, it

i might seem natural that enforcement i

of their use should be more strictly
regulated. But this latest proposal
aims at enforcement for the wrong
reason.

Given the downtrodden state of
the current economy, enacting a law
that would provide sureﬁre 
for the state — even if the state can
only use it on roadways —- must ap-
pear attractive to legislators and state
ofﬁcials But monetary motivation
might well be the  incentive be-
hind this proposal, and passing new
laws in order to reap their ﬁnancial
beneﬁts is both unethical and dis-
honest. -

In addition to the money the state
would receive from the federal gov-
ernment, more tickets issued would

mean more money generated from
penalty fees \While not  a seat-
belt on could prompt the  pull-
over by police, other trafﬁc violations
could easily be tacked on.

Police routinely patrol city streets
and state  to keep a range
of trafﬁc violations in check —— from
speeding to  to aggres-
sive  To properly enforce an
obligatory seatbelt law, patrols might
not need to increase their manpower,
yet stopping diivers for declining to
wear a seatbelt would still take up an
ofﬁcefs time. Theofﬁcer could have
used the time andeffort it takes to is-
sue a ticket for not  a seatbelt
to pull over drivers for more poten-
tially dangerous violations like speed-
mg .

Should a driver or passenger ne-
glect to wear a seatbelt, he puts him-
self at risk for  Although those
not buckled in could collide with
other passengers during more severe
car crashes, the risk of injury that
they pose is largely personal. Reck-
less  however, unquestionably
subjects other motorists and pedes-
trians to danger beyond their control
Therefore,- the state should not ham-
per police with enforcing a potentially
less  t:rafﬁc violation.

The actual enforcement of this

policy would only be muddled by

disputes arising between accused
violators and the police It’s difﬁcult
to prove that you weren’t speeding,
and regarding seatbelt wear, the of-
ﬁcer can only fall back on his word.
The police can’t rely on the aid of
their trusty radar guns in seatbelt sce-
narios .

Seatbelts should always be worn,
but it’s best to keep the policy on
their enforcement as is. The only real
gain from upping the enforcement
policy would be a boost in the state’s
ﬁnancing

Road to Impressionism

Through May 24
The Frick Art &_ Historical Center
7227 Reynolds St.
Open Tuesday — Sunday, 10 a.m. — 5 p.m.

Shortly before the time of Mo-

. .net’s famous water lilies, a rebellious
‘group of French artists were meet-

ing up  the small village of Barbi-
zon in the mid—l9th century. Their
mission was simple —— paint the na-

. ture that surrounded them.

Beginning this Saturday, The
Frick Art & Historical Center will
host “The Road to Impression-
ism: Barbizon Landscapes from the
Walters Art Museum,” featuring 32
pieces from artists such as Theodore

' Rousseau and jean—Baptiste—Camille

Corot showcasing the forests and
waters in which the painters spent
their time. ‘
The Clayton house is still deco-
rated with the same Barbizon paint-
ings that Henry Clay Frick collected.
Visitors will be able to witness these
paintings, as well as the exhibition.
— “It’s neat for us to be able to
present this exhibition because we

have similar pieces that have been
here for over 100 years,” said Lan-
gel, the Frick media and marketing
manager. ‘A ’

Sarah Hall, director of curato-
rial affairs, explained why it was so
common for American collectors
like Fiickand Walters to target the
Barbizon 

“These were some of the first
contemporary paintings collected
in America. Because the country
was young, collectors were without
years of artistic education or people
telling them what a good painting
was. The natural inclination towards
landscapes in the Barbizon paintings
appealed to the Protestant work eth-
ic,” said Hall.

In the 18th century, Hall ex-
plained, most painters went to Italy.
for training. It wasn’t long, however,
until the French started to protest;

“Barbizon was a meeting place ‘

outside of Paris, where artists could
gather and paint outdoors,” said

.Hall. “It really was an anti—academ-

ic movement They were saying
‘I don’t need to go to Italy. I don’t
need to put a figure in the painting

' to make it important. I can take in-

consequential subject matter and i

Senior Staﬂ Writer

Here’s a little joke I’ve been work-
ing on: Two dead politicians and a
Nazi walk into a Hollywood awards
ceremony. Nobody gives a damn.

Get it? Because the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
doesn’t, and the joke is on them.
Movie blog Slashﬁlm reports that this
year’s Best Picture nominees are some
of the least watched in the history of
the Oscars, and even the popular ones
+ “Benjamin Button’ ’ and ‘ ‘Slumdog
Millionaire” — only seem popular

by comparison. Following snubs of :

more popular fare like “Wall-E” and
"The Dark Knight’ ’ in favor of avant-

Impressionism, page  Charles-Francois Daubigny's "Twilight (The Seine at Andresy)" from 1867 is on display now at Frick;

garde sleepers like “The Reader,” fans
and the media are  foul, accusing
the academy of snobbery. The general
response from the academy is predict-
able: “Hey, aren’t the Oscars supposed
to be avant-garde?”

— A justreaction, sure, but also in-
dicative of elitist Hollywood isolating’
itself even further. Of course, the Os-
cars are supposed to honor the year’s
top achievements ir1 cinema, that’s the
point. But if no one is watching —
and based on the box ofﬁce returns,
it’s likely — then the point is moot.
Face it, as much as celebrities love
winning Oscars, they love people see-
ing them win Oscars even more.

The Oscars are just like everything
else on TV, albeit with‘ one 
exception. The  is that more

‘viewers means more advertisers,

Reel Talk with Tom

which means more money to spend

whether you’re the Academy Awards

or “According to]im_.’ ’ I
The difference is that the Oscars

cost alot more money than the av— ,

erage crappy sitcom —— in 2007, the
ceremony cost a hefty $30 million.
This means they need those view-
ers, or else the money disappears and
Hollywood’s elite can forget about the
Kodak Theatre and just rent a ball-
roomattheSanI)imasRedRoofInn
for their next bout of self—congratula—
tion.

I Last year,  for the Oscars
reached an all-time low, and many
blamed the lack of popular movies

a on the ballot One might expect the

academyto  up a bit this year
and throw some nods to movies just

as deserving and signiﬁcantly more

popular  the ones it did nominate,
but instead it has proven once again
that artistic integrity — or at least the
pretense of it—is stronger than a lus

for ratings ‘

‘We don’t think about the TV’

show,” said long—time academy mem-
ber (and nominated director) Ron
Howard to Entertainment- Weekly
‘As much as the academy board or
the network might like the member-
ship to collectively decide how to put
on the very best TV special they pos-

’ sibly can, it’s just not what we do.”

Naturally Howard, defends the
voting academy — his “Frost/Ni'x-
on” is the lowest  Best Picture
nominee out of the bunch. But in a
way, he’s ﬁght. I don’t think “Marley
& Me” should be nominated for any-
thing, anywhere, ever, and least of all

ate merit? Oscar sa is ' es’
    Y Y

just because it’s raked in over $150 mil-
lion. As much as I wish people made
more movies like the low—grossing
nominee “l\/lilk,” I wish even more
that people would go see the movies
that already exist .

To be fair, .the awards ceremony
is in no real danger of going bust,
though its ratings and ad revenue are
steadily slipping And maybe the acad-
emy didn’t vote solely on artistic value
after all —- by nominating lesser—seen
movies, it could have hoped to gener-
ate interest in them to bolster ticket
sales V »

If that’s the case, theyfve failed mis-
erably for the second year in a row If

-we don’t see a ratings spike -on Feb. 22,

Ron Howard just might have to cast
a ballot for “Hannah Montana: The.
Movie” next winter 0 if '

White Birds EP
Sarah Flmm
Se|f—Released
Rocks like: Tori Amos,
Bjork, Natalie Merchant t

Countless people download albums
for free. But with Sarah Fimm’s-new EP,
White Birds, you can do it legally. Radiohead
taught her well.

Since 2001, Firnm has released three
-full-length albums and her most recent
EP. With each release, Fimm has chiseled
her way into" a more focused sense of self
and, as a result, has put out records that
are deeply personal and exploratory. While

some of her most notable work does have .

an Amos—esque tinge, her music has always
felt like it has belonged to her alone. Her
straight—from-the—gut—to—the-mic approach
is a sincerity rarely evident in pop music.

The mosﬁ encouraging thing about_
IV/Jile Birdr is not the music, per se, but

that the music is free. Yes, free — avail-
able at WhiteBirdsEP.com. Whether this is
some sort of allegorical subtext riding on
the coattails of Fimm’s heavy “free—ﬂying”
bird imagery is hard to say, but it is deﬁ-
nitely a sign of life in an ever—dwindling
business. i

The songs on EV/rite Bz'rd.r are very con-

cept—oriented, and thus, the EP functions

less like a standard EP (to get new material
out between albums) and more like a “mini
album.” The six songs are deeply intercon-
nected and all have a kind of warm, am-
bient resonance that echoes from track to
track. The album as a whole feels autum-
nal and harkens to visions of lonely seaside
towns overrun by dirt and sea birds.

The opener, “Counting Waves,” is a
mid—tempo, billowing pop ballad with sen-
timental lyrics lathered in seaside imagery.

The only track on Wbite Bircir that really

evokes Fimm’s traditional sound is “Let it

Run,” which, ironically, is the only track on
which she did not collaborate with produc-
er David Baron. This track embodies Fimm
in its elements of pop, hard rock, electronic

Sarah Fimm's Bi/'94 REP flies for free

and a vocal austerity juxtaposed with playful
lyrics, a style which has become her strong
point. “Let it Run” is a deﬁnite standout.

The most disappointing track is “Ta—
mara Song,” which barely raises any emo-
tion, and remains on the same level of
relative ﬂatness for its entire ﬁve—minute
duration. While it’s deﬁnitely a lovely and

ethereal song, it ﬂows like crystallized hon— ’

ey —— as in, it doesn’t.

“Afraid” has a drawling, almost East-
ern motif that weaves in and outbehind
Fimm’s dour vocals. Musically, it is deﬁ-
nitely the strongest song on the EP. From
the warbling intro to the screeching string-
laced outro, it is almost six minutes of
well-crafted melancholia.

The closing title track, “White Birds,”
is the most experimental andyetiprobably
the least interesting. It is slathered in elec-
tronic beeps and buzzes coupled with re-

petitive, relatively weak lyric's. Though, the _

EP doesn’t end on a high note, it deﬁnitely

has sweet spots.
Still, for free, White Bird: is truly liberat-
ing.

Collected works to leave lasting impression

hnpressioﬁgln, page 8
make it interesting. It doesn’t need to be an
allegory about life.”’

The painters of this time employed dark
colors for their work, a literal contrast to the
bright and cheery pieces of the Impression-
ists who came after them. The Barbizon art-
ists did much of their work in the Forest of
Fontainebleau.

“The forest was often described as a savage
environment There were big old oak trees,
and [it] wasn’t very attractive. But as a reac-
tion to the 19th-century Romantic movement,
suddenly savage became very appealing,” said
Hall. “This was also the time when tourism
was beginning. So the tourists would get maps

‘ of the forest and walk around, but the Barbi— -

zon artists deliberately ignored them.”

While the exhibit is arranged themati-
cally by location of the landscapes rather than
chronologically, it allows, viewers to see the
changes -in  style that ledto Impres-
sionism. ~~ '

“There are great comparisons. In Barbizon
paintings, you get a sense of the timeless and
eternal experience,” said Hall. “But  Impres-
sionism, you really see a particular, ﬂeeting
moment.” I

The Frick will also sponsor a number of
programs to supplement “Road to Impres-
sionism.” Tours will be available on Wednes-
days, Saturdays and Sundays. On Fridays the
gallery will ho_st talks with museum staff. Res-

In conjunction with the Barbizon Ian -

scapes on display, The Fiick will also present

its collection of drawings by 19th-century
French painter ]ean—Francois Millet; “\X/e own
the second-largest collection of his work on
paper,” said Langel. “He was very inﬂuential

.to the artists who made a name in France”.

Because of the fragility of the 11 pieces, they
are rarely exposed to light, spending most of
their time in storage. The display, titled “A De-
votion-to Work,” will run at the same time as
“Road to Impressionism.”

Young propels No.1

Panther ps

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta E9itor

With less than ﬁve minutes gone
in the first half of Pitt’s basketball
game against West Virginia Monday
night, Pitt center Dejuan Blair picked
up his second foul and slowly made
his way to the bench.

Blair, who averaged 15.7 points
*and 12.7 rebounds entering the
game sat for the remainder of the
half. \W1th Blair out and guard Le-
vance Fields also sitting with two
fouls, Pitt’s bench poured onto the
ﬂoor. That’s when Sam Young knew
it was his turn to pick up the scoring.

Young scored 20 points — 12
ofwhich cameinthe ﬁrsthalf—to
help lead No. 4 Pitt past West Vir-
ginia 7059 at the Petersen Events
Center in the 177th rendition of the

Backyard Brawl.

While the Panthers (22—2, 9-2 Big
East) scored more than 90 points in
each of their last three contests head-
ing into Monday night, they counted
on defense and strong bench play to
push past the Mountaineers. This
was true especially in the ﬁrst half,
when Blair and Fields were limited.

Pitt had three steals, four blocks
and outrebounded West Virginia
(,l6—8, 5-6 Big East) by ﬁve in the first
period, which was heavily occupied
by Pitt’s bench players Nasir Robin-
son, Gilbert Brown, Ashton Gibbs
and Brad Wanamaker.

' “We got great minutes [from the

bg:nch],” said Pitt coachjamie Dixon. '
“It was our bench that really pulled_

us through.” »

Gibbs, a freshman guard, had
ﬁve ﬁrst—half points — including
three on a step—back 3—pointer that
cut West Virginia’s lead to one After
trailing for a majority of the ﬁrst half,
he and Young helped spark a 10-3
Pitt run that gave the Panthers 21 29-

‘ 24 halftime lead.

When Blair came back on the
ceurt to start the second half 
felt a little closer to normal. Coming
off a career-best 32 points in a win
against DePaul on Saturday, Blair

scored his eight points to help Pitt
build a 12-point lead. But after argu-
ing about his third foul call, Blair was
whistled for the ﬁrst technical foul of
his career and hit the bench with four
fouls Blair didn’t play another min-
ute in the game, but it was already
too late for West Virginia.

While several Pitt players stepped
into their roles on the offensive end,
the Mountaineers’ foul trouble kept
them out of the game.

West Virginia guard Alex Ruoff,
who averaged 16.2 points per game
 the contest, fouled out
with 7:18 remaining in the second
half junior forward Da’Sean Butler,
the Mountaineers’ leading scorer
on the year, fouled out just minutes
later. Ruoff ﬁnished the game with
17 points on 4—of—9 shooting, while
Butler scored just four on 2-of-12
shooiing. ,

“Ruoff is a good player, he’s a

good shooter,” said Pitt guard jer-
maine'Dixon. “It helped that he was
on the bench a lot”

After the Mountaineers’ top two
players were gone, the Oakland Zoo’s
“start your tractors” chant began.

Pitt ended the game with a 39-23
advantage on the boards, and shot
48.1 percent on the game compared
to West Virginia’s 40.4 percent.

“We can’t get outtebounded by‘ 1

16,” said West Virginia coach Bob

Huggins “We just can’t.”

Wanamaker hit two 3-pointers
in the second half off the bench,
 the game with six points
and ﬁve rebounds. Fields scored 13
on 4—of—10 shooting, while junior
guard Jermaine‘ Dixon ﬁnished with
nine on. 4-of—7. Gibbs ﬁnished with
seven.

9 The Littman Test

Rodriguez, Phelps not

by Adam Littman
Senior Staff W/riter

 

If this past week has made me thankful
for anything, it’s that I don’t have children.

Really, how do you explain what’s trans-
pired over the last week or so to a child? I’d
prefer to sit down a roomful of children
and tell them that Santa isn’t real instead of
telling them that former golden boys Alex
Rodriguez and Michael Phelps are horrible
people. -» 4 ,

They were arguably two of sport’s big-
gest, most popular stars. They weren’t just
extremely talented, non—threatening athletes,
but exemplary human beings.

Or so we thought. Cue dramatic music.

On Saturday, Sports Illustrated reported
that A—Rod tested positive for steroids in

exactly best role models

2003. The story said Rodriguez was one of

104 players to test positive for steroids that
season, but his was the only name men-
tioned.

Rodriguez was- supposed to break every
offensive record in baseball._ He was sup-
posed to set everything straight after all those
juiced-up fellas destroyed baseball’s integrity.

It’s just disappointing, you know? He was
such a great role model for the children. In
1994, he made his ﬁrst start when he was
only 18, and in his first full Season, 1996, he
led the American League in batting average,
runs, total bases and doubles. Since then he
somehow managed to only get better.

And he did it all with perfectly tanned
skin, frosted tips and a reputation for being
a hard worker. -How do you tell kids not to
take steroids once they ﬁnd out A-Rod did

Littman, page 15

February 10, 2009

The Pitt News 0 wvvw.pittnews.com

15

Littman, page 12

it? I don’t think you honestly can.

I’m not a steroid expert, but I’d bet A-
Rod went for the cheap kind, which is ter-
rible considering he is the recipient of the
two highest contracts in sports history. The
biggest example being they stopped working
in October. _

Also, the report states he took them in
2003, which coincides with his first MVP
award. That year he hit .298, had 47 home
runs and drove in 118 runs, all while playing
for the last-place Texas Rangers.

Since then, A?-Rod won the  award
in 2005 and 2007. He hit for a higher aver-
age, more homers and more RBIs in those
two seasons for teams that made the play-
offs. So not only is A-Rod a cheater but one
who doesn’t spend his money efficiently.

Whﬂe A-Rod cheated the game of base-
ball, Phelps cheated the hearts of Americans.

This past summer, Phelps became one of

the nation’s all-time great athletes by 
a record eight Olympic gold medals, 
him 14 in his career, also a record.

Last weekend, a British tabloid published
a photo of Phelps smoking marijuana while
at a college party in South Carolina.

Shortly after, defensive cries of “He’s

” only 23!” came from every corner of the In-

ternet and TV box. It seems like a reasonable
excuse, except Phelps is also a professional
athlete, and thus, a role model.

The only times we should see Phelps out
of a pool are when he’s standing on a plat-
form to accept a medal after  a race,
helping a kitten down from a tree or saving
Japan from another Mothra attack.

What’s even more troubling about the de-
fense of Phelps is that it was pot, a gateway
drug. Hasn’t anyone else taken health class?

' How soon  a French tabloid publishes

pictures of Phelps snorting cocaine while on
acid?

[ Banned substance didn't
help A-Rod in playoffs

Are we going to turn our heads ir1 2012
when Phelps is swimming in the Olympics
with a syringe sticking out of his arm and
starts making left turns in the middle of his
races? \While some horrible people, myself
included, would love to see only heroin-
addicted competitors in the Olympics, our
children don’t need athletes looking remotely
like Keith Richards.

To be fair, Rodriguez? and Phelps are
about as good of role models at this point
as Rae Carruth, and that’s a shame. They
seemed like two of the good ones.

- Now it’s up to parents to ﬁnd which oth-
er athletes are worthy of being role models
for their kids. Sure, your kids could look up
to doctors, teachers, policemen, ﬁremen and
assorted other respected professionals from
around the community, but are they going to
hit a’ game-winning home run in the World
Series? \Well, to be fair, A-Rod isn’t going to
either. 4
But that’s not the point; Athletes aren’t
here just to entertain us these days. They’re
here to raise our kids, teach them you don’t
need to memorize the periodic table of el-
ements if you can memorize 25 different
handshakes. Or you don’t have to shovel your
elderly neighbor’s snowy driveway if her sug-
gested payment isn’t your market value.

You really need to start doing some in-
tense research, parents. If this past week
should have taught you anything, it’s that we
don’t know athletes like we think We do, and
idolizing them as anything but athletes might
not be so smart. ' I

_ Make sure you talk to your kids about
why not all athletes make great role models
and to be careful who they worship.

Let them know the “athletes as role mod-
els”  might not work, and that’s when
you should suggest trying out a musician or
actor.
