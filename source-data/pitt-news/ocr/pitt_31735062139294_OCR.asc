CARD OF THANKS

 

.THE PITT WEEKLY wishes
to express its «hearty appreciation
of the manner in which the stu-
dents aided in making successful‘
the conference of student editors,
held under the auspices of the de-‘
partment of journalism, last_ week.
The problem of room and board
for the delegates to the conference A
as one of the greatest that had
‘to‘befsol‘ved by the managers of
the-conference, and a deep‘debt of
gratitude is due the fraternities and
sororities of‘ the’ University, who
responded .so nobly in the 'r‘natter_
of the» entertainment of the dele=,
gates. Thefsuccess of the confer-
_ence was due,..in no small part, to
the sﬁirit of:co-operation displayed
by t e ,_memb,ers of the student
body in making the visitors to the

mountains and lack of water
more than the poor
bear, and they died by the hundreds.
This compelled us to depend on only
a pound of bread and a quart of water
each day. The cost of wine in Amer-
ica was never more dear than the cost
of water in the mountains -above the
fortress Bizani. Beyond this fortress
we could see the city and its romantic
lake. ’I‘he sight made us more thir_sty_
than ever. Some days we were with-

not allowed to make ﬁres for fear of

certainly no tents "were allowed ex-

set them up in deep crevices‘, hidden
from view. It was Jan. 20th, 21st,
22nd and 23rd that we suffered nzost.
At that date we charged the enemy
and drove them from the Eagle
Heights to the very fortress
Bezaiii and Gastrika. That day was
just like one in summer.« It ‘was to
me one long to be remembered. VI,
captured the ﬁrst Turk of my com-
pany that day .and repeated twice
more. But the following three days‘
were days of snow, rain, cold and
and
snowed -75' hours consecutively. , VVe
dared not set up tents or light ﬁres.

nights. It took us ten days to dry
ourselves. - God forgive me, I devised
mary rash, acts 6f how to end my suf-

our company only‘ll5 were capable-
of duty. Our feet were swollen to
twice their size. Since then. my
health has been poor, also.

I will write more in the future, or
perhaps come and tell it verbally in

PITT LOSES FIRST MEET,
FOR MORELAND TROPHY

 

Galvin Breaks Record—Final Score
’ pIs 35 1-2 to 20 1-2.

The W. & J. track team defeated
Pitt in‘ a rather uninteresting meet
last Saturdayon their home ﬁeld.
’l.‘he result of the meet came as a dis-
tinct surprise to the followers of Old.
Uni., who had considered “defeat im-
possible. This defeat was due in part,
of -the new
-cinder track to which the 'W,»& J.
men were accustomed. However, in
the ﬁeld events -Pitt won the majority
of points. Owing to the strong, cold
wind which blew across _the ﬁeld and

the poor condition of the track, only
mediocre performances were possible’

ila the runs.

The stars of the meet were the
Springer Brothers, who took ﬁve out
of a possible six places in the sprints
and" broad jumps; Floto, who won
botlh the mile and the half mile; and
our-own “Polly” Galvin, who came

to the rescue of Pitt by winning the.

16-p-ound shot put. In‘ this event
“Polly? established a new Western
Pennsylvania intercollegiate record
by making the great heave of 42 feet
2 inches. This performance is all the
more noteworthy "as he has not been
able to devote much. time to. practice
this year. » . ' .- _

Another record was also broken in
the broad jump by Sam 'Springer,*who

.made the ﬁne jump of 22' feet_3 inches".
Scott of Pitt showed ﬁne form in

the hurdles, easily winning the low
and being barely nosed out‘in'.the
high. . . ’ I ,
' Panyity makes a new addition to
the “letter men” by winning the" high
jump; ,Pitt had things their own‘ way

WINS HOT GAME

 

-In a fast and interesting contest,

‘filled with "sensational plays on both"

sides, Phi Zeta lPhi“d’efeated Sigma
Alpha Epsilon in the second« of a
series of inter-fraternity games to be
played between the various fraterni-
ties of the University of Pittsburgh,
by the score of ,3-2.' The game" re-
solved ‘into a pitchers’ battle betweeﬂ
“Peg” Haines and “Keg” Boggs. Both
men allowed seven hits, but the ‘Phi
Zeta support was steadier. in the
spinches. ' A -

- In thelﬁrst round, after two men
were out, Huff of S. A._E. connected
with .a fast one and sent it out of the
lot for a home run. Phi Zeta Phi tied
the'score in the fourth on a single, a
stolen base and an error. S- _'A. E.
_forged ahead in the sixth, when Me-
Cormick made a wild heave ’.to the
plate in an effort to make a do.uble
play. Phi Zeta tied the score in the
same inning with two hits and an

error. The game was won in the
-eighth, when McNaugher singled,
stole second and third, and scored

when McCormick drove one through
Fryor, at second base. ,

- The game was called in the eighth
by mutual consent. .

FR’AT.ERNITY_ BASEBALL
LEAGUE WILL BE FORMED

 

Plans are under way at the present
time to form’ an inter—fraternity base-
ball league in the University. Muc'n
interest is being manifested by the
members ofthe various fraternities of
the University in this matter and it is.
‘thought that the league will be formed
in the near future. So far_ there have
been two games playedsand it__is in-
tended that these games shall count in
the standing of the league.‘ ’ It is the
intention of those who are at the head
of the organization to have each "fra-
ternity play two games with every
other fraternity and in this way to de-
termine the championship ' for the
present year. In case of ‘tie in the
number of games won, the two teams
having won the most games will play
off the—tie at the end -of season. L

There will be no varsity player per-
mitted to take part in the fraternity
games, in or-der't'hat all the teams may
have a fair and equal chance to make
good in the league. There is much
good material in the ranks of the se-
cret societies of the school and the
-games that have..be‘en played so far
have beeniclose and interesting. -

In the next issue -of the WEEKLY
a full account of the new league with
‘a schedule of thegames to be played
will appear. All members of fraterni-
ties who are interested in the matter
of.a baseball league should, get in
touch with“ Russell Stambaugh or
Harold Rounds. - o I

PIT’l‘ BLANKED BY -
 _wEsT VIRGINIA

 

Inability to hit in‘ pinches cost Pitt
t'he game _at Morgantown last Friday
afternoon. The game was fast and
only one hourand 20’minutes was re-
quired to play it. The real feature of
the game was the pitching of Riehl,
who replaced I-Ieiner, as but 22 men
faced him in seven innings. The ﬁnal
score was: West Virginia 3; Pitt 0.

 

ALLEN BACK’ IN GAME

Catcher Allen ‘returned to the game
"Wednesday after an" enforced retire-
ment causedby a split nger. Baker
ﬁlled Allen’s shoes well during the
captain’s absence. Giles is playing a
fine game at first. The other inﬁeld
men are in good form now, also.
Gaw’s ability to catch the base thief
and Schenk’s great stops prevent
many scores. All the men are in ‘ﬁt
ﬁhape and are out for blood Satur-

Pitt Determined to Have Re-

‘venge for Defeat‘ Suffered '

. at Washington ‘Wednesday¥-
Riehl to Pi-tch.  

Players,. students, alumni and
friends ofythe University of Pitts-
burgh impatiently await the call to
“play ball’’ which will send, the dia-

mond forces of Washington‘& Jeffer-

son. and the University of Pittsburgh
into mortal combat to-morrow‘ after-,

_noon_at Trees stadium.‘ This will be

the first real home game of the season
and the fansare more than anxious
to- see the gam'e. The cont_ests that
‘have been played at home so’ far this
season have been rather tame and re-

sulted in easy victories for the Blue '

and Gold, but the contest to-morrow
promises, to be one of the greatest
battles-that evertook place at Pitt.

Pitt was‘ defeated’ in a good game pm

at .Washington last ,VVe'dn'esd'ay. and
will go into ‘the contest determined

to make good,‘ while the Washington .

aggregation will be just as determined
to win the second game of the series
and make a clean sweep. Riehl will
probably be one the moundfor Pitt,
while if is likely that Greenway, who

‘pitched a steady game for the Red

& Black Wednesday will be called on
to try to r.epeat. A This makes certain

that there will be ’a ‘lively pitchers ‘

battle. Capt. Allen is back in’ the
game for Pitt and his presence will do

much to make the players exert them- ' .

selves to the_liinit in'an effort to-take
the game.

The management is preparing for a;

big_ crowd. Bleachers _ have been
erectedﬁn ri‘ght.ﬁe.ld so that there will
be plenty ‘of seats. for all those who
attend the game. The game will be
called‘ at 3:30. . .
