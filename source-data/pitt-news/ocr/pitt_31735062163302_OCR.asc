 Than First Game Loss -Showed 

   

By BOB SMIZIK

Fans who expect a Panther rout of
Washington tomorrow had better’ heed
the words of-assistant. coach Carl DePas—
qua, who scouted the Huskies in their_loss
to the Air Forcelast Saturday. According
to DePasqua, Washington has a solid ball
club and is better than it showed in losing

to the Air Force. ' '
“There’s no question in my mind that
this is going to be one of the toughest hit-
ting teams we will play,” DePasqua said.

DePasqua felt that Washington could

have beaten the Air Force if they had
come up with the big‘ play in critical sit- ‘
uations.  ‘
“If Washington had come through at
certain points it could have turned the
tide of the game,” he ‘said. “They missed

- two ﬁeld goals and twice were unable .to
get thé necessary yardage on fourth down.”-_
 DéPas_qua’s analysis of‘ Terry Issacs_Qn,.

The description reads as though it

were made for Pitt’s _quarterback Fred

Mazurek. If Mazurek performs as well_ ’

as Issacsondid in movingthe Air Force
to a -last, minute score, it could prove to
be a long day for Washington and a
memorable one for Mazurek; V .
The Panther signal caller won’t' soon
forgethis performance against UCLA. If
the quarterbacks job had been _a question

Although Paul Martha was voted back
of the game, it was mainly for his defen-
sive work. Mazurek was the offensive star

By AL BLUMKIN
Coach John Michelosen’s nationally-ranked football team will

‘ meet the University of .Washington Huskies tomorrow at Pitt
' Stadium in an effort to record their second straight win of the
season.  . I
T The Panthers ‘are ranked tenth in the‘ nation by the Associ-

’ ated Press pool of football writers and broadcasters. This is the

‘ ﬁrst time the team has been nationally. ranked since their opening
win over UCLA in 1958. The Panthers wound up with a 5-4-1
ilrecord that season. »

In Washington, the Panthers will ﬁnd_ a team that is rugged
defensively, but only fair offensively. The Huskies were defeated
by the Air Force Academy, 19-7, in their only game of the season.
Their failure to contain Falcon quarterback Terry Isaacson ‘and
their inability to gain necessary yardage in key situations were
.the reasons for the‘Huskies’ downfall.

‘ The Huskies’ record shows they are tough defensively. They
gave up an average of eight points per game in ten starts last
year. Panther backﬁeld coach Carl DePasqua said,’ “There is no
doubt in my mind ,that.this is going to be one of the toughest
’-hitting teams we will play.” '

Redmen Leads Line

Washington is led by junior guard.Rick Redman, an all-West

Coast selection last year. Other veteran linemen who will see
action are Rick Sortun, a guard who is ‘ranked in the same class

with,Redman, and tackles Mike Briggs and Joe Ryan. ' q
_ The Huskies have only eleven other lettermen. They are‘
woefully, inexperienced at center, end, and halfback. They
"lostthir ﬁrst three centers, ﬁrst four ends and ﬁrst four half-
backs. Their best rurmer, all-American candidate Junior
Coﬁey, was removed from the picture when he sustained a
broken leg in pre-season practice. ' _,

The probable starting‘ backﬁeld from Washington will be

.-Bill Douglas, q];)., Ron Medved, lh., Bill Sifter, rh., and Charley
Browning, fb. Husky publicity director Gorden_ Green is optimistic,

every Saturday.”
Win On Field
_ The Panthers are anxiously awaiting this game. They are out
to prove‘ the victory over UCLA was no ﬂuke. Michelosen’s men
. are not taking the Huskies lightly. Captain Al Grigaliunas said,
“This is one year we are going to win the games on the ﬁeld in-
stead of in the newspapers. I told the boys not to read any ‘press
clippings all week.” ' ‘ ' 1‘ - 
, Theotfense, which racked up 420 total yards last week
'1. will be severely tested by‘ the Huskies, who have lost only
one game by more than two touchdowns in the last four years. ‘T
1, The Panthers starting backﬁeld of Fred Mazurek, _Paul
, .Mar-tha, Bill Bodle, and Rick Leeson will: be ready to test the
,Husky defense. ' '
.Michleosen hopes the ﬁne offensive blocking will continue.

‘ —The forward wall performed superbly at UCLA as tackles Ernie

Borghetti and John Maczuzak opened up holes to ruin the Bruin‘
'defense. * ' A '

V The Panthers are in -excellent shape physically. Aside from
end Bob Long, who may be out for the season, there are no
.injuries to any of the key men. Therewill be" no changes in the
jstarting lineup. ' l '. " l , ~

.1” ml... Fullback Leeson

Views Strength of Gridders

By MARV ZELKOWITZ

This year's Panther foot-
ball team is smarter and
- faster than last year's team,
according to Rick Leeson,
fullback and All-America
candidate. ' V
,“The team is faster this
year,” the blond-haired 205-
pounder said. “They really
want to go, and we have the
type of team that can do it. *
, “We have a smart team, too,”
he said. “The quarterback is
calling smarter plays this year.
(Fred) Mazurek‘,won’t call a_
play unlessit can work.”

Although he praised
team, Leeson refused to single
out any player as the star.
“There’s no one outstanding
individual on the team,” he
said. “The boys have good
spirit. They want to play ball,
and they like to play .ball.”

Leeson did cite Fred-Mazurek
as an outstanding addition to
this year’s squad, however.
“Freddy’s'doing a great job for
us this year at quarterback,” he
said. '

. “In ‘our type of. offense,
Freddy ‘ is an asset,” Leeson
continued. “Jim (Traﬁcant)
couldn't run, but Fred is a good
runner, and he’s a pretty good
passer, too.” . '

The success of the team is

foremost in Leeson’s mind, not ‘

.;his chances to e a rn an All-
American rating. “I’d rather do
well and have a winning season
than be an All-American. As a
senior, it would mean _a lot
more to me and to the team.”

Neither is the fullback en-
grossed with copping the rush-
ing honors on the football team.
“It makes no difference who

carries the ma-il'~‘so long as it

gets delivered,” he said.
Leeson does admit, however,

that he prefers carrying the

ball to tackling an enemy ball-
carrier. “I’d' rather play offense
than -defense,” he said. “You
can’t score many touchdowns
playing defense. "

“I’d rather run.over someone

than have him run over me,”
the Scott Township star said.
Leeson also enjoys the place-
kicking- chore on oﬁense. “I
love every minute of it,” he
said. “I know I’m of vital use
to the "team. A lot “of times
games can be won on an extra

» point or a ﬁeld goal.”

Leeson t-h en _expressed his
feelings on blocking. “ I ‘very
seldom ‘blocked in high school,”
he said. “All I wanted to do
was run the ball.

“Now it’s different,” he con-
tinued. “Someone blocks for
me, and I block for. someone
else. I get‘ as much thrill from

springing a guy loose as _I do '

from carrying the ball. I’m
getting to the point where I
really enjoy blocking.” , ,
The big fullback is some-
what unusual in that he gets
along well. with his rival, John
Telesky. The two even room

Smizik’s Predictions Holding;

Last week‘ Bob “Sage” Smizik predicted that he would
win the Yogi this year. So far, the Sage’s prognostications
have been the most successful.

But, most important, he holds a three game lead over
