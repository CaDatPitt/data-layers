Student Government Asso-

.the board of publications an-
nounces a change in the
format of Polaris andthe pub-
lication of The Pitt Calendar.

The Pitt Calendar, a new publi-
cation, contains a listing of.Uni-
versity organizations, their officers
and advisers, as well as a com-
plete calendar of University events
from September through June.

The new publication makes pos-
sible the reduction in size of the
Polaris and a more compact and
convenient reference and date
book.

At a meeting last May with
Dr. Peake it was decided that
the former Polaris was too bulky
to be carried conveniently, and
a decision was reached to change
the Polaris to a publication for
freshmen and new students only.

The new Polaris is ﬁve by sev-
en inches in size and thirty—two
pages long. It will be distributed
on Sept. 18 at the Dean of Men’s
and Dean of Women’s assemblies.
Additional copies will be available
at the Student Desk on the
ground floor. ,

The Calendar is three by six
inches in size and 96 pages in
length. It will be sold during

at a meeting in the Cathedral

the plan was formulated in ac-
cordance with the University’s ob-
jectives of improving the quality
of educational programs ‘while
also making it feasible to increase
enrollment markedly.

The aspect of the plan, upon
_which the University hopes to
make progress soon, is the pro-
posal which would permit-con-
struction of a library building,
and a group of buildings to
house the professional Schools
of Business Administration, Re-
tailing, Law, Education, Social
Work, and Public ‘and -Inter-
national Aﬁairs.

It is in the area now bounded
by Oakland Avenue, Forbes Ave-
nue, the South side of Forbes
Field,‘and Schenley Park Plaza
that these buildings will be con-
struced. '

Reroute Forbes Avenue

To make this possible, Forbes
Avenue would be rerouted. to
swing southwest at South Craig
Street, run in an are behind
Carnegie Institute Museum and
Library and Forbes Field, and’
return in a northwest direction to
reconnect at Oakland Avenue with
its present route.

Proposal Calls for Forbes Avenue Rerouting

. See picture, page 3 .
The University announced last week a long—range cam-
pus development plan which includes. as a major feature the
construction of extensive educational facilities in the Forbes
Field area and the rerouting of Forbes Street between Oak-

Street.

The plan was reviewed for Mayor David L. Lawrence
and the City Council by Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld

of Learning. _

The over-all campusplan includes proposals for a library
building, dormitories, a natural sciences quadrangle, physical
education structures, and a group of buildings to house six 0
the University’s professional schools.

The Chancellor remarked that’

i

would mean also that Bigelow
Boulevard would begin at Fifth
Avenue instead of at Forbes
Avenue.

The rerouting of Forbes is nec-
essary for, without it, trafﬁc con-
gestion would increase with the
construction of additional educa-
tional and dormitory facilities.

Produce Quiet Atmosphere

Other advantages of rerouting
would be the reduction of safety
hazards and a quieter atmosphere
in which academic activities could
be conducted. ‘ '

The--consideration of extend-
ing the campus into the -area
presently occupied by Forbes
Field is a practical possibility
now that the construction of a
_municipal stadium is probable.

“University development in this
area would mean a deﬁnite up-
grading of the commercial aspects
of the Oakland area,” the Chan-
cellor claims.

Housing for 7000

“The University will construct
dormitories for 3500 students and
have other housing for about 1000
student and faculty families. This
means 6000 to 7000 new residents
of Oakland whose needs will cre-

Salk Gets New Grant

Research

For Polio
Dr, Jonas E. Salk of the

University has received a
March of Dimes grant of

$262,000 to be used in the-

continuation of his immu-

nological studies.

The grant was announced joint-
ly by Chancellor Litchﬁeld, and
Basil O’Connor, president of the
National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis. L

The investigation Dr. Salk is
undertaking is an outgrowth of
his work on the polio vaccine that
bears his name. The Salk vaccine

»is made of polio virus grown in

cultures of monkey kidney tissue.

‘Since the supply of this tis-
sue is limited, there has been a
concerted effort by many work-
ers to ﬁnd a suitable substitute
for the monkey kidney cells.

Dr. Salk, long engaged in this

"search, has had some measure of

success in that his laboratory has
isolated a strain of monkey heart
cells. that multiplies indeﬁnitely
in tissue culture. “

. This self-perpetuating line of
cells could. be ideal for vaccine
production since it would elimin-
ate our dependence upon monkeys
or other animals to grow the virus.

Dr. Salk has proved by ex-
periments on animals that these
cells do not cause cancer and
that it is possible for them to
produce an immunity.

In addition to his work with
normal and malignant cells, Dr.
Salk will continue his investiga-
tions on the duration of immu-

-nity following innoculation with

the poliomyelitis vaccine.

He is also interested in other
factors which may be responsible
for apparent break—throughs
which occur occasionallyIin vac-
cinated children.

Attorney Horty
Heads Center
In Health Law

Pitt has‘ established a health
law center within the Graduate
School of Public Health. The di-
rector is John F. Horty, Jr., at-
torney from Johnstown, Pa.

Mr. Horty received his under-
graduate degree with honors from
Amherst College in "1950 and re-

— ce'ived his law degree from Harv-

ardein 1953. lie has been a re-
search associate in public health
at i-Pitt since 1956.

“The purpose of this law center
is to pursue, on a sustaining basis,
studies concerning the legal as-
‘pects’ of medicine, dentistry, nurs-
ing, public health, hospitals and
medical care,” Dr. James A. Crab-
tree, dean of the Gradaute School
of Public Health, said.

A’ Dr. Crabtree concluded, “To
our knowledge, this is the only
center of its kind in the nation.
«It offers an opportunity to estab-
lish a-permanent, dynamic focal
point for exploring various legal
facets of health programs and

Ggraphical and political position. -

With Iran bordering Turkey
and the Soviet Union and lying so
close to Pakistan in addition to
being a member of the Baghdad
Pact, a secure friendship with that
nation is indispensable.

The -aﬁiliation between the
two schools has been endorsed
by the State Department-and a
grant has been secured from the
United States Information Serv-
ice, making possible an exten-
sion of the program.

After nearly a year of planning
which began when the idea was
ﬁrst conceived last fall, ﬁnal nego-
tiations were concluded by Dr.
Litchﬁeld and Dr. Ahmad Farhad,
Rector of the University of Tehran
While the Chancellor was in Iran
during the latter part of July.

During his stay in Iran, the
Chancellor also went to Shiraz,
in the southern A part of that
country, to speak with the Shah
there_about building an Ameri-
can-type university.

Dr. Litchﬁeld offered the as-
sistance of Pitt in carrying out

ate extensive and varied oppor-
tunities for many kinds of busi-
ness enterprises.”

The Chancellor said no esti-
mate of land acquisition or con-
struction costs could be made
at this time because architectur-
al and engineering plans are
not complete and the means of
ﬁnancing the projects are not
certain.

Speaking of the basic purposes
underlying the plan, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld said, “the University is
an integral part of the city. We
must never forget that its chief
purpose is to meet the needs of
the people, the industries, and the
public agencies of this community
and region.” '

“If the University is to meet the
growing needs of these groups,
then it must begin now to improve
and expand its resources for doing
so."

Completion Target-1962

The Chancellor added later at
a news conference that the pro-
posed library could actually be
started even before Forbes Field
is acquired. He said that as long
as they had the adjacent property,
there would be no reason why the
structure could not be started.

He also expresesd the belief
that the whole program could
be completed by 1962, with the
library being ﬁnished one year
earlier.

Here is the statement issued by
Mayor Lawrence after the meet-
ing. —
“There is no doubt that the
University of Pittsburgh’s plans
will make this one of the out-
standing educational institutions
in the nation and a distinct credit

 One University} Answer

a tribute to the resourcefulness of Chancellor. Litchﬁeld.

Although many of the new buildings already construct-
ed, such as the Schools of the Health Professions, were _con-
ceived before the arrival of the Chancellor, this whole pro-
gram may ‘be attributed to the work of what should no
longer be termed the “newT’ administration but rather the
present administration.

The library building is sorely needed. The rerou-ting of
traffic would allow for a less congested and quieter campus,
perhaps more conducive to learning and reflection.

T The dormitories for 3500 willmake this school the cam-_
pus school in which the scheme of development of the total
individual may ﬂourish. _

The increase of enrollment contemplated will require
long—range planning in the area of scholarship——loan—
guaranteed work opportunities. The tuition is certain to
rise moderately /within the next few years and many top
students from both within and especially without the city
will require substantial scholarship aid to pursue their ed-
ucation at "this University.

‘The construction of separate buildings for six of the
professional schools will vacate a good number of ﬂoors in
the Cathedral proper. - -

i It is to be hoped that good use will be ‘put to the Ca-
thedral of Learning as these schools move their program

' from it. ' ,

The major stumbling block to swift implementation of
plans for the “new campus” is the-terriﬁc outlay of millions
it will require. , . _

This should provide just the sort of challenge which Dr.
Litchﬁeld is capable of meeting. It will be an opportunity

  

from industry, alumni, and foundations. These sources may
be shown exactly where their dollar is going;

A student is fortunate to attend a University at a time
 of dynamic change. and forward motion. This is a graphic
 picture of one university’s answer to the space age.

A.» Sweepers. Must Go .

CD   Hodgepoclge 

By Millard Amdur
_Governor Leo Hoegh, the head of the Oﬂice of
Defense Mbbilization and Civil Defense appeared
on Meet the Press, September 7.

He had little to say in defense of the adminis-
trationlpolicy and what came out presents a sorry
picture 6: what is likely to
happen in the event of atomic
attack.

The one point which was
pressed home by the panelists
in a most devasting manner was
the failure of the federal gov-

for the building of shelters.

Governer Hoegh insisted that
throughihis program of educat-
ing the people they will build their own shelters.
“It’s their responsibility.”

Government Protected

’ It was then brought out by one of the news
analysts that the government had made extensive
provision for the building of shelters for the gov-
ernment officials, federal, state, and local.

‘ It would appear from the previous omissions in
the present plans that theywill be among the few
left alive. '

Governor. Hoegh is spearheading his program
with"the dissemination (one of his pet expressions,
it seems) ofilittle leaﬂets, October 11, by the Boy
Scouts. What good these will do, only time will tell,
but I for one say no good whatsoever.

Fallout ’ Described _

The booklets describe fallout as one might to a

ﬁrst grader indicating its similarity to a particularly

 

 
  

carpet sweepers should be employed to sxveepzdlp O‘
the rest of the mess. ' ~ 7

“Don’t do it by hand. Use your sweeper and
discard it afterwards.” Of course, the electricity
available will be abundant immediately after the
attack. ._ ~

When asked how many Americans are building
their bomb shelters, Governor Hoegh fetchingly
mentioned that his children are encouraging the
neighbors to do it. At least one street in the U. S.
may be protected.

What kind of drivel is America expected to
accept? Governor Hoegh mentioned that in the
Indian Age, people protected themslves and he
seemed very little fazed when informed that we
live in the Atomic Age when people don’t store
pocket A—bombs in their homes.

Unrealistic Approach Cited

Nor are most of them going to build bomb
shelters unless coerced into it. This unrealistic
approach to a serious problem is certainly not
going to develop into a cohesive program to pro-
tect millions of people. . ‘

One last belly laugh. When asked how New York
City was being protected, Hoegh brought up the‘
possibility of evacuation. How much advance notice
would it require? Only 36 hours!

We need a good intelligence department, Hoegh
noted. we need the Almighty Himself to get, that
much notice. a

I’d suggest we get on the ball. Get someone who
won’t speak in vague generalization which, he
knows doesn’t answer basic questions, someone with

, the gumption to ﬁght for necessary increases in the

budget to provide for series of community bomb

for the solicitation of increased amounts of ﬁnancial support ”

    
  
   

strong X-ray.

Fallout dust, it purports, should be washed off -
after the attack (there’ll be plenty of water?), and

shelters in metropolitan areas.

A Split In November--Maybe

Scott, McGonigle and Platform

By Murray Chass

There are a thousand good
laborers for every crooked labor
leader, so says Andrew Gleason,
Republican candidate for Secre-
tary of Internal Affairs. He
made this statement in backing

the stand that
the GOP lead-
ers have taken
in their plat-
form, in which
the Republicans
have made a
strong bid for.
labor support.
This combi-
nation of plat-
form and can-
didates is a
most important
one for the local GOP this Year.
For as mostpolitical analysts —-
and even the more realistic and
smarter Republicans — claim,
the Grand Old Party must steal
off with _a victory this year or
else face political death in the
state for some time to come.

The State committee woman
brought news to the meeting
from the Republican national
chairman, Meade Alcorn, to this
effect. Alcorn, she said, Wanted
it known that the Party nation-
ally is counting heavily on the
local outlet to overthrow the
Democrats.‘ A

Meeting Provides Tipotf
The Pittsburgh meeting very
well may have been the tip off
as to ‘how the Republicans will
fare in the November election.
The platform and the speeches
by the‘ candidates for Governor
and United States’Senator took
precedence over everything else.
Voters have reached the point
where they do not ‘care to put
too much emphasis on platforms
when deciding whom to vote for.
But these documents cannot yet
be ruled out. The GOP platforms
list a number of pledges that
are designed to aid the workers.
This labor plank, the party
hopes, will gain them backing
that they have -not had in the
- past. ,
- Aflong with a pledge that they
‘will not pass an incomeor wage

stantial one and should be no
detriment to the Party’s chances.
There were two things that were
left out, however. They fail to
say where or how they will raise
the money the State so badly
needs and say nothing of right-
to-work laws.

Men of Contrasting Ability

— The real test of victory, of
course, will come with the candi-
dates for the top two positions.
In their campaign kick-off
speeches before “the committee-
men and county leaders, Arthur
McGonigle and Hugh Scott pre-
sented themselves to be men of
contrasting ability. '

McGonigle, a man with no
government experience, showed
himself to be a surprisingly poor
speaker. In a one-sentence op-
inion of his talk, it was a poor
delivery of an‘ otherwise good
speech. As an example of the
below—pa_r delivery, there were
two places in the speech that
were marked “PAUSE.” At these
points the house was to have
come down, so to speak.

But the gubernatorial candi-
date ruined these altogether. In
one instance he was to have said,
about George Leader, “. . . he
can’t forget the future.” How-
ever, it came out with the nega-
tive meaning and by the time
McGonigle stammered around
correcting himself the whole ef-
fect of the expected cheers was
lost‘.

What does oratorical ability
have to do with the executive
capabilities of a man? Nothing,
really. But foremost among the
needs of the Republicans is a
man who can sway the ~voters
both with his speaking and his
record.

Since the Reading businessman
has no record to speak of, other
than the fact that he has built
up the largest pretzel company
in the world, he must be able to
present himself to the public in
a capable fashion.

Scott Impressive

Hugh Scott, on the other hand,
was impressive as he ad-libbed
and quipped his way through his
introductory remarks and then

_- presented a prepared speech into
which

he threw many _more_ . ad-

   
  

“B?

There’s one alternative. Give up the ghost. Some
scientists say this would-be the best idea anyway.

Before he got underway in
telling the gathering his person-.

al philosophy, he quipped that _

“the only man to get a refund
out of the Leader administration

was the gentleman who ‘was
ﬁned by the same state police-
man who caught Mayor Lawt-
ence’s son speeding.”
‘ Here is a man with an excel-
lent record and background (16
years in _the House of Represen-
tatives) who holds his listeners’.
close attention with a good and
an interesting presentation. A
From ﬁrst appearance, "then,
the Republicans have chosen 
pair of candidates who could
give them a split on November
4. But if a split is what it will
be, the Republicans will just re-
place the retiring GOP Senator.’

Two Freshmen  Awards

From Negro Scholarship F undid

Two freshmen, Patricia Marlow
from Washington, D.C., and Ra-
mona Montier of Braddock, Pa.,
have re c eived supplementary
scholarship awards from the Na-
tional Scholarship Service‘ and
Fund for Negro Students.

The NSSFNS has granted 52 of
these awards totaling about
$17,000 to outstanding Negro high
school students from 21 states in-
cluding 11 in the South and the
District of Columbia.

They provide for the student’s
expenses needed over and above
college scholarships, family con-
tributions, and earnings and sav-
ings. -

Money for these awards is

provided by a number of indi-
vidual funds and issued not only
to aid freshmen but to continue
to assist previous award winners-
throughout their college years.’

T h e a n n.u a l supplementary
grants are the culmination of the
N a t i o n a 1 Scholarship Service’s
overall effort to seek out and help
talented Negro seniors to continue
their education. _

‘In the ten-year history of
NSSFNS, the agency’s counseling
service has helped more than 5,200
Negro students enter over 350 in-
ter-racial colleges and universities.
Total scholarship aid of almost
$2,000,000 was secured for these
students. ‘ '

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH

Today begins my ﬁfth year of writing this column, and what an
eventful five years it has been! What things have these old eyes
not seen! What great.discovcries have rocked ‘the world—t.he
anti-proton, for instance, and the anti—neut.ron, and high-low
split, and Brigitte Bardot!

In these five years it has also been discovered that American
smokers like two kinds of cig:u'ettes—ﬁlter and non-ﬁlter. The
Philip Morris Company makes both kinds. I 1ne11tio,v_1 the
Philip Morris Company because they pay me to mention the
Philip Morris Company. They sponsor this column. I write it
and then they give m_e money. Then I take the money and pay

‘my grocer, my butcher, my gardener, and my four madrigal
singers. In this way full employment is inaintained and we
avoid a repetition of the Panic of 1873 when bread riots killed
over 98 million people in Muncie, Indiana, and millions of others
were reduced to ghost—writing Ph. D. theses to keep body and
soul together.

But enough of gloom. Let us get back to cheerful subjects,
like the,products of the Philip Morris Company. For those of
you who wish ﬁlter cigarettes there is Marlboro, which now,
more than ever, gives you a lot to like—a brand new improved
ﬁlter and aiwonderful ﬂavor that comes breezing right through.
For those of you who wish non,-ﬁlter cigarettes, there is Philip
Morris, a mild natural blend, ﬂavorful, fresh, and thoroughly
agreeable. For those of you who can’t decide between ﬁlters or
non-ﬁlters but have an aﬂinity for packages, I should like to
point out that both Marlboro and Philip Morris come in both
the crushproof Flip-Top Box and the good old-fasliioned Soft
Pack, and you will surely want several of each for your collection.

Speaking for myself, "I smoke both Marlboro and Philip
Morris in both packs. What I do is make kind of a fun thing
out of it. In my bedroom I have four signs, one on each wall,
which say in turn: “PHILIP l\IORRIS—SOFT PACK”,
“PHILIP MORRIS_—FLIP-TOP,” “MARLBORO—SOFT
PACK” and “MARLBORO——FLIP-TOP”. When I get up in
the morning I put on a blindfold and then my faithful cat Rover
spins me around six times and then, with many a laugh and
cheer, I walk forward with my ﬁnger outstretched and the ﬁrst
sign I touch is the cigarette I smoke that day!

   
  

    

/er am a/ /7m’/rza/zz’

of merriment to Rover and me, except for one untoward in-
cident one morning. I was stumbling around in my blindfold
and fell out the window right on top of a man named Fred .R.
Timken, a census taker, and broke all his lead pencils. He was

, cross as a bear, and though I offered him both Philip Morris
and Marlboro in both the Flip-Top Box and Soft Pack, he

refused to be molliﬁed. In fact, he refused to put my name
down in the census, so when you read population figures of the
United States, will you please add one?

But I ‘digress. We were speaking of Philip Morris and
Marlboro who will bring you this column throughout the school
year. In this space I will take up vital aspects of undergraduate
life, like high-low split and Brigitte Bardot, and it is my fondest
hope that the column will. be half as much fun for you as it is

In Coliseum

anthers  
 Team To Face Mystery

       

 

This Week

' By LARRY HAGGERTY -.
A week from today the Panthers will play their ﬁrst mys-

tery opponent in Skyscraper U
Coach John Michelosen’s boys

athletic history. It is true that
are scheduled to meet UCLA

in the Coliseum on Sept. 20. But the mystery is just what
players will represent the Uclans at kickoff time. _
The Bruin’s new coach, George Dickerson, has seven

 

 

 

-

potential regulars who are in the‘

famous “doghouse.-” That is be-
cause the Paciﬁc Coast Conference

has leveled a penalty against
UCLA for tasteless recruiting.

These seven selected seniors are
permitted to play ﬁve consecu-
tive games of their choice but
must pass up the rest of the
schedule.

To Skip Panthers

The pipeline from Los Angeles
says that the seven players have
voted as to whom they will ap-
pear against- this season and at
least six of the “redshirts,” as
these lads are called, have decided
to pass up the tilt with the Pitts-
burghers.

The main reason for passing
up the opening game is that the
seven “bad” boys want to play
against Stanford which is the
sixth game on the Bruin’s 1958
schedule. Stanford is the team
that UCLA just loves to encoun-
ter and defeat. ' V

Leading the list‘ of ﬁve game
eligibles are All-American end
Dick Wallen and All-Coast tackle
Bill Leeka. The others are tail-
back Don Long and four linemen.

26 Lettermen Return

Last season the Uclans captured
eight of their ten games using just
juniors and sophomores. Besides
the seven redshirts, Coach Dick-
erson will have 19 fulltime mono-
gram winners available for the
Panther battle.

The Bruins do not need to
worry if Long misses the ﬁrst
game. _ Supporting him at the
tailback position in Dickerson’s
single attack are three seniors,
Chuck Kendall, Kirk Wilson and
Jack Steﬁan.

Then if these four men happen
to get hurt in the ﬁrst half, Dick-
erson can still come up with an-
other gifted tailback. He is Sop-
homore Dean Moore. “Moore was
the star of last season’s freshman
team and can run, pass and kick
as good as any second-year man
in the nation,” commented Dick-
erson. ‘ -

Backﬁeld Strong

Meanwhile, after two weeks of
practice, the 1958 Panther foot-
ball team looks faster, smaller and
more versatile than it did a year
ago at this time. The Jungle Cats
appear to possess. two strong back-
ﬁelds this season.

The ﬁrst unit has "Bill Kaliden
at quarterback, Dick Haley at
left half, Joe Scisly is the right
halfback while Fred ’ Riddle
holds down the fullback spot.
In the second string backﬁeld
are halfbacks Chuck Reinhold
and Curt Plowman, the fullback
is Bob Stark and Ivan Toncic
holds the quarterback position.

Two veterans return at ends,
Art Gob and Jim Zanos. Back-
ing them up are several‘lettermen
and sophomores. The center slot
is. held down by Co-captain Don

oyeWestForOplene

Dickerson Inherits Redshirts

Bru insFacePenaltyProblems

UCLA, the Panther’s ﬁrst
opponent, faces the impend-
ing season with seven players
limited to ﬁve. consecutive
games under conference pen-
alties, but foes have learned

to fear Bruin teams under even
the stress of such circumstances.

Without the services of any
seniors last year, UCLA tied for
ﬁrst place in the Paciﬁc Coast
Conference and won eight of their
ten games. T his is the third sea-
son in a row that they will be
barred from the Rose Bowl.

Following the tragic death of
the incomparable Red Sanders last
month, senior assistant coach,
George Dickerson, was named to
succeed his great teacher “for
more than a period of one year.”
Thus Dickerson is deﬁnitely not an
interim coach. .

Team Is Potential

The seven players, who are
known as “redshirts” on the Coast,
are all on the potential ﬁrst team.
Among them are All—American
end. Dick Wallen, All-PCC tackle

Crafton» and Seraﬁno 'Fazio.

V. Although starting guards John
Guzik and Co-captain Ed Mich-
aels are both experienced letter-
men, there is no depth at this
position. The only tackles with
any playing time are lettermen
Er-nie Westwood, Bill Lindner
and Ken Montanari.

Michelosen deﬁnitely has pro-
blems in the‘ line. If sophomores
like Mike Ditka, Fritz Walker,
Jim Cunningham and Ed Sharock—
man come through, however, the
Panthers should have very little
trouble bettering last season’s 4-6
record.

A PURE WHITE MODERN FILTER

GEORGE DICKERSON
Faces ﬁve-game blues

Bill Leeka and Don Long the
Bruins’ top tailback.
2 If the “redshirts” pass up the
tilt with the Panthers, Coach
Dickerson’s single wing will be
minus the services of Long.
What will the new coach do
then? .Well, he may start Chuck
Kendall, who merely led the
team in rushing last year and
had a .500 passing average.

Kendall, however, underwent a
knee operation last spring and it
remains to be seen whether his
knee will hold up during the
scrimages prior to the. meeting
with Skyscraper_U. ‘

If it doesn’t, Dickerson can call
on either Kirk Wilson who holds
the national college punting re-
cord for one season—-49.3 yards
per punt—-or a powerful runner,
Jack Steffan. ‘

Bill Mason closed the 1957
season in great form at right
halfback and should be tough
on those famous Bruin reverses.
His experienced understudy is
Phil Parslow. ’
Two Smiths, Ray and Nathan,
take care of the fullback chores.
The top quarterback’ in the block-
ing spot is Steve Gertsman, an-
other of those limited to ﬁve
games. Behind him will be Junior
Dave Peterson.
Pivot Spot Weak
The Bruins’ two best centers,

i Dennis Dressel and Dick Butler,
‘; come under the ﬁve game spread,

and this could be the soft spot in
the Uc1an’s armor. Leeka and Jim
Dawson are the top tackles, but

, both just happen to be “redshirts."

Dickerson’s best guards should
be Clint Whitﬁeld, another ﬁve-
gamer, and Joe Harper who was
outstanding during the 1957
campaign.

In addition to “ha1f—time” Wal- _

len, the.Bruins’ have John Brown
and John Pierovich as veteran
ends. The most promising sopho-
more players on the squad are
backs Dean Moore and Don Keith-
ley and a center, Ben Treat.

It is most difficult to venture a
guess as to who will gwin this

game, but if Dickerson doesn’t_

play his seven “redshirts,” he may
start out his coaching career on
the wrong foot.

will gently attempt to view discerningly Pitt athletic a<¥

ventures.

The view taken will necessarily be a_narrow one since
it is personal, but it will always be direct and accurate. The
column won’t hesitate to take a stand on sports issues nor
will it sidestep controversy for the sake of a united front.
Offbeat ideas, along with different slants, will appear as oc- LS”—‘“°° ..

casion demands.

The only guarantee made by this department is that the
column will usually make lively reading. End of introduction

they will do. I don’t imagine we will take ten straight and
Nebraska will prevent our dropping the whole schedule-full,

on the other extreme.

, It is entirely unwise to pick the won and lost columns h°“t/ Murray Ch-ass’ °°1“mniSt
beforehand. If the forecast is optimistic, th'e coaches bare
their teeth, and if gloom is predicted for the team, the players
quietly, but effectively make their displeasure known. (“Why Just because he had no family
do you make us out to be‘ bums, you bum?”)

While the Won—lost guessing is ruled out, there seems to Self_
be better justiﬁcation for discuss-4; O -

ing the kind of action which the
sports addict can expect, if not

‘ actually witness. John Michelosen,

head coach, may be gambling this
season on his offense. He has
made it plain since spring prac-
tice that the tutorial intention is
to f‘open things up.”

To be more metaphorical, this
means that passing will be the
entree and ground gaining can be
employed as appetizer, dessert,
and demi—tasse.

The big plays, designed to pick‘
up large pieces of yardage, will

come by passing. Running plays
will set up the_ passes, ram over
the touchdowns, and pick up the
extra points. With the advent of

p ‘the two-point conversion, via run-

ning or passing, some interesting
techniques of maneuvering by
coaches will be displayed.

The conservative school, headed
by Woody Hayes of Ohio State
and Hugh Daugherty of Michigan
State, will stick to the old one-
pointkick conversion. As in the
old days, these powerhouses will
aim to overwhelm opposition by
brute force.

The radical school may go all
out and always attempt to snap
up two points. This maneuver may
do much to make collegiate foot-
ball ‘more spectacular, and conse-
quently have it follow the “pros”
-more completely. The quick score,

and the more often the better,

‘could become the credo of college
football this fall.

More to the point, Michelosen
may have this razzle-dazzle brand
of play buried in the back of his
single-wing head,. just awaiting
the ﬁrst whistle on Sept. 20 to
throw ‘it at- UCLA. If this al-
in 0 s t impossible circumstance
comes to pass, and there are fools
extant who believe it will, the
season would prove most exciting.

The necessary ingredients in

i this pigskin formula are quarter-

backs and ends; or as Dizzy Dean
might perfer to call them pitchers
and catchers. Will Kaliden, Ivan
Toncic, Ed Sharockman and David
Kraus are capable throwers. The
opinion is, however, that one of
them must play most of the time
in order to make the offense a
cohesive unit. Dividing the lion’s
share of playing time between
two, or even three of them, could
be risky. It was last year.

The woods of Allequippa Street ’

are rampant with receivers. To be
brief, Art Gob and Bo Zanos, ends,
and Dick Haley and Joe Scisly,

V. h-a-lf-backs, head the crew. Other

sticky-ﬁngered lads are Bob

Rathi, Fritz Walker, Joe Pulle-

 and Mike Ditka,,who have

‘Antiqua’ Plays
Brussels Fair
In September

The University was represented
at the Brussels World’s Fair last
week when the Antiqua Players,
an original Pitt musical ensemble,
g-ave a concert at the American
Pavillion.

The Antiqua Players played in
Brussels at the invitation of the
U.S. State Department. They left
for Europe July 28 for their first
European concert tour beforetheir
World’s Fair concert on Sept. 8.

Composed of ﬁve professional

A musicians who play medieval and

baroque music on authentic re-
productions of instruments of
those er-as, the Players group is
well—known throughout the United
States for its concert tours, ﬁlms,
tapes,-and records.

Two of the members of the
Antiqua Players are on the Pitt
faculty: Colin C. Sterne, associ-
ate professor of music history
and literature, and his wife,
Roberta Sterne, a lecturer in the
modern languages department.

The instruments include re-
corders,. a type of ﬂute; viola,
bowed string instruments; the
lute, a plucked string instrument;
a ﬂute of the baroque period; and
the harpsicord and virginals, both
keyboard string instruments. '

Their August European tour
took them to Trinity College of
Music in London, the American
Summer School at Fontainbleau,
France, and Berlin where they
recorded for the German radio.

The Antiqua Players, who
originated at and are affiliated
with the University, have in-
strumental resources that are
unique in the United States.
Some of their instruments date
back as far as 1550. _,

The Brussels trip was spon-
sored by grants from the Honored
Heinz Endowment and the United
Steelworkers.
