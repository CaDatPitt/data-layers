SGB to hold open interviews
to replace ex-member Carl  

by Drew Singer
Staﬂ Wrder

Since the sudden and unex-
plained disappearance of Student
Government Board member Josh-
ua Carl, ﬁlling his seat has become
apriority.

Now that the application pro-
cess is over, SGB will host the
eight candidates for a question-

and-answer session at A tonight’s
public meeting.

_While board members are tra-
ditionally elected by a vote of the
student body, the SGB constitution
calls for only board members to
vote in this particular situation. A
simple majority vote is all it takes
for one candidate to win, and Pres-
ident Shady Henien may onlyvote
to make a tie.

Henien called on all students to
attend tonight’s meeting and ques-
tion their potential representatives.

“This is your opportunity —— a
unique opportunity,” Henien said.
“These applicants that are coming
forward are not rtmning a tradi-
tional election, and more so than
ever we need the students’ input

‘When Run read some lyrics Mc-
Daniels had written in English class,
he told him he would put him on the

McDaniels was in his college caf-

says rap

In attendance were several student
musicians, including rapper Nick
Pratt, a.k.a. Yung Neo, rap producer
Melvin Goinseand R&B singer, Feli-
cia Renae.

Pratt, a junior from Fort Worth,
Texas, said he has. started “the col-
lege boy movement,” where he raps

about the things he and his peers are‘ I

going through as Pitt students.

In his newest song “Half- Price,”
Pratt says of certain campus sports
celebrities: “Being the man on cam-
pus must be nice, but deep inside we
know you really half price.” ,

McDaniels, 43, who released a
solo albuni called “Checks, Thugs
and Rock and Roll” in 2006, plans
to continue making records, writing
books and making movies about hip-
hop. 7

“Once a rapper always a rapper,”

SGB vets think experience will help get the job

SGB, page 1

because one of these candidates will be the
one who represents them for the next few
months.

“I want the students to come out and
voice their concerns and ask any and every
question they could have.”

Whoever wins the ballot — a win that
could potentially be achieved with as few as
two votes from the current board members
— will sit on the board for the next three
months, until the regular yearly election
takes place.

Eight applicants are vying for the open
board seat.

“I was going to run in December any-
way,” candidate Nila Devanath said.
Devanath, who currently chairs SGB’s aca-
demic affairs committee, said she sees_many
advantages to being promoted to this posi-
tion on the board.

“It’s harder for committee chairs to get
stuff done because they’re appointed,” she
said. “So if I were on the board I could have
more access to administrators and be able to
get most of my projects done in a very ef-
ﬁcient way to get results out to students as
quickly as possible.”

Devanath’s committee organized the
recently passed resolution calling on the
University to set a policy that would restiict

the number of ﬁnal exams a student can be "

made to take in a single 24-hour period.

While numerous students — including
public relations committee chairman Perry
Servedio and governmental relations com-
mittee chairwoman En'n Schaefer —, al-
ready involved with SGB have applied for
the position, some outsiders also feel that
they deserve a place on the board.

“I think that I bring a fresh perspective,”
said candidate Lee Every, a junior. “I’ve in-
volved myself in a variety of different ways,
and getting involved in SGB is something
I’ve always wanted to do. It’s a great oppor-
tunity to represent the student body.”

Those with experience working for SGB
see it as a distinct advantage.

“The public relations chair role put me in
a good position to meet a lot of student lead-
ers on campus and just many more people

in the administration,” Servedio said. “For a
lot of people, three months isn’t that much

time, but I think’ over the course of the next
few" months I would be able to get a lot ac-
complish .”

Regarding the diﬂerences among the
candidates, Henien said, “We have greeks,
non—greeks, ranging from sophomores to
seniors, people who have never had relation-
ships with SGB before to committee chairs
— it’s pretty diverse.”

The predominant issues incoming can-
didates are faced with include feedback on
and criticism of the new meal plan system,
continuing discussions to re—vamp SafeR-
ider and increasing communication among
student organizations.

“I look forward to creating a more cohe-
sive relationship between organizations in

 

the University that you may not think have
too much in common, but if you align their
goals, should be working more cohesively,”
Every said.

“I know a lot of students are unsatisﬁed
With SafeRider, and I feel that we need to
overhaul that system,” said candidate Gary
Sanderson.

Sanderson decided to run after Henien -
who happens to be in the same fratemity as
him — approached him about the position.

“I was pleased with almost every appli-
cant,” Henien said. “They have a lot to offer.
It’s going to be a tough decision, but rest as-

sured that we’re only going to take the best

applicant who can best serve the students.”

After the public questioning at tonight’s
meeting, which will begin at 8:45 on ’ the
eighth ﬂoor of the union, SGB will take a
week to deliberate and then publicly vote at
the following week’s meeting.

“Personally, there are a couple applicants
I see higher than others. But to  fair, we
should deﬁnitely listen to all of their promis-
es tomorrow night,” Henien said. “The pur-
pose of SGB is not about glorifying yourself,
it’s about making the school as good as we
can for the students.”

Record industry needs to

change business model

The Recording Industry Asso-
ciation of America’s crackdown
on 14 students at Pitt last week
was just the latest of its futile at-
tempts at preserving an industry
that has been struggling for years.

The students — whose names .

were matched with. the Internet
protocol addresses monitored and
provided by the RIAA — received
pre-litigation settlement letters last
week informing them that they had
been caught illegally download-
ing music on campus computer
networks and would have 20 days
to settle their ﬁnes, a minimum of
$750 for each copyrighted record-
ing that had been infringed, out
of court. The Pitt students were
among 403 students at 22 univer-
sities who received the letters.
The RIAA has historically tar-
geted students on college campus-
es — a demographic known for its
high rates of illegal downloading.
While illegal downloading is,
inarguably, against the law, its
prevalence — particularly among
college students — since the in-
ception of ‘online music sharing
should be telling the recording in-
dustry something: Despite RLAA
crackdowns on illegal music
downloading, people will contin-
ue to download music illegally.
Why? Because it’s out there,
and economic theory tells us that
if we can get the product for free,
there’s no sense in paying for it.
Of course, it’s not that simple.
People who download music ille-
gally aren’t just getting the prod-
uct for free; they’re stealing it.

But, until this trend goes away, the A

recording industry is going to be
left with two options: Fight it or
join it.

Sure, the RLAA can continue
to cite illegal downloaders, but
they’re never going to make up
for the amount of money they are
losing every year. So instead of

, H,» -,...w ......'.,_.;_‘.“»—

...-....—.-... ($3 . 90.-,«, ..,—,.v

ﬁghting the trend, why not create
a new-business model that buys
into it?

Just look at_ the TV industry.
Instead of cracking down on the
millions of viewers who turned to
Internet downloads of TV shows,
they decided to stream their shows
online for free, making money off
of advertisements.

Even within the music indus-
try, there have been some strides
at co—opting the trend of online
music downloading. Apple has
become incredibly successful by
selling individual songs on its mu-
sic program iTunes.

And just this week, Radiohead
announced that they will allow
fans to download their album for
free — or for as much as they
want to pay. The band, no longer
signed to a record label, believes
this method could present a viable
model for the future of the mu-
sic industry, particularly because
with such high amounts of on-
line streaming and downloading,
bands currently make little from
record sales.

And why-not? By putting their
music out there for free, Radiohead
is encouraging fans to get music
from them and not through an il-

legal channel. And who knows,

grateful fans might even donate a
few bucks. Additionally, offering
up their music for free might even
generate a larger amount of inter-
est — which could translate into a
larger amount of concert revenue.
Ultimately, the RIAA can con-
tinue to crack down on people who
download music illegally, but it is
never going to tame the beast. The
future of the music industry is the
Internet, so rather than continue to
ﬁght the trend, the RIAA needs to
change the music business model,
or the music industry will continue
to lose millions of dollars to illegal
downloading every year.

  Embracing the new iPod

Brown wants an iP0d, and he ’ll ﬁnally admit it

 
 
 
     

Columnist
Richard V
Brown

I have a confession to make. It’s
kind of uncomfortable for me, but I
just have to get it olf my chest. So,
here goes; I want an iPod Not just
any iPod, mind you, but the brand
new iPod Touch with the super-
high-tech touch screen, 16GB of
ﬂash memory and all. that other
awesome stuff.

Now, probably 99 percent of
you out there are saying, “Who
cares? Just go buy the thing then,”
but it’s more complicated than that.
Ever since the iPod became popu-
lar, I’ve looked down on it as infe-
rior technology that only caught on
because of its design.

To me, the iPod has become less
of a piece of technology and more
of a status symbol: Having an iPod
makes you cool, just like everyone

‘else who has an iPod. Getting one

is your initiation into the “iPod
Clu ,” where everybody compares

songs and walks around with little
white earbuds to let everyone else
know how cool they are.

So I rejected the iPod and be-
came a proponent of altemative
MP3 players. The way I saw it,
there were far superior devices that
might not have been as pretty to
look at but had better battery life,
more storage and cost less than a
comparable iPod   ’

I’ve been the owner of several
MP3 players over the years, in-

a Toshiba Gigabeat, both of which
outstripped the iPod technically
while still costing less money. I
scoffed at the puny four hours of
video battery that iPods got, or
their measly 20GB when I had 30
for the same price. I felt superior
and “undergroun ” for bucking the
system and doing things better in
pretty much every category I could
think of.

Which is why I have such a
hard time admitting I want a1;t_,iPod
Touch. I mean, it’s only got 16GB

of memory on board, which isn’t
much at all compared to most other
MP3 players. The battery runs out
fast when you’re watching movies,
and they scuff and scratch so easily
that I’d have to baby it like it was
made out of eggshells.

But I still want one. The touch
screen is so cool! It’s got Intemet!
And it’s hard to argue against the
fact that the iPod Touch is like the
MP3 version of Jessica Alba: It’s

‘ small, slim and unbelievably sexy.
The only thing is that I feel like a
complete hypocrite. I know that
the iPod Touch isn’t even the best
iPod that Apple makes right now
(that honor would have to go to the
Classic,'which is sturdier and has a

v better battery for less money), butl
don’t care. i

I don’t care that 1 could ﬁnd an
MP3 player with better specs for
more than $100 less. And I don’t
care about the fact that for the last
ﬁve years or so, I’ve been tell-
ing people that they should have

bought something other than an iPod.

I'm even kind of ashamed of that, really.
I’d never gotten too huge‘ a kick out of the
click wheel on the original iPods, so I never
thought it was an especially wonderful 
even when all my friends were going “Man,
it’s so awesome” to each other as they scrolled
through their song lists. I would stubbornly
play with multiple buttons and harder inter-
faces and tell myself that they only had iPods
to be clique—y and to ‘ﬁt in with each other.

But now I realize that it’s possible to just
be so overcome with something that it liter-
ally infects you and makes you want it just
so you can have the same thing your friend
has. It was never a case of being part of a

“clu ” — or at least, it wasn’t entirely the '

case — but instead the most effective irnple—
mentation of design and viral marketing the
world has ever seen. Apple made something
that anyone — not just tech nerds and com-
puter jockeys — could use and appreciate

‘and even think was cool. When one person

got his hands on one, everyone else would
see it and say “Wow! I want that too!”

It’s just that I never thought the ﬁrst iPods
were that great, so I never had that thought.
But now with the Touch I realize what it’s

like to really want something just because of j

the coolness factor, regardless of the techno-

logical side. It’s like how lots of people want ~

a Lamborghini, even though they’re difficult
to drive and don’t handle half as well as cars
that cost far less.

So, to anyone whom I ever told not to buy
an iPod, I’m Sony. I know where you’re com-
ing from now that I’m experiencing the same
thing. And I’m sony to Apple too, since I ba-
sically slandered and maligned their products
without ever really experiencing them.

I know it’s a hard thing‘ to come back
from such hypocrisy, but hopefully you’ll all
forgive me. I’m saying it to the whole world:
I want an iPod, and I don’t care who knows
about it.

Now I just need to ﬁgure out how I’m go-
ing to afford it.

Coming to a theater
near you this fall

by Steve Kaszyeki
Staff Wrder

Attention serious moviegoers: It’s safe
to go back to the theaters.
That’s right, the onslaught of medioc-

rity that encompassed the summer — big, '

bland blockbusters and long—shelved di-
sasters —- has now passed. And while the
rest of the year is far from free of trash,
there is much to be excited over.

Crime and punishment is the theme of
the day in several major releases this fall.
“American Gangster,” Ridley Scott’s take
on the rise and fall of drug kingpin Frank

' Lucas, stars Denzel Washington and Rid-

ley Scott, as criminal and cop, respective-
ly. Fresh off the failure of “Scoop,” Woody
Allen offers “Cassandra’s Dream,” the
story of two hard-luck brothers who turn
to crime. Along similar lines, “Before the
Devil Knows You’re Dea ” casts Philip
Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke as,
not surprisingly, hard-luck brothers who
turn to crime. Pre-release buzz has been
stronger for the latter.

Contemporary political issues hardly
go neglected. Meryl Streep appears in
two ﬁlms tackling the matters, “Rendi-
tion” and “Lions for Lambs.” The former
casts her as a nefarious bureaucrat ruining
Reese Witherspoon’s day by having her
Egyptian—bom husband kidnapped and
tortured. The latter, straddled with a desul-
tory trailer, ﬁnds her on the other end of
the political sphere, interviewing a serpen-

tine senator (Tom Cruise) while director
and star Robert Redford lectures about
something or other. Ho-hum. “The Kite
Runner” shows Afghanistan (concentrat-
ing in the Taliban era) through the eyes of
Afghanis, something rarely seen since the
compelling “Osama,” and is much more
promising than either Streep ﬁlm. '
Then there are the high—proﬁle adapta-
tions. After a string of failures, the Coen
brothers have generated much buzz for
the stark, quasi—westem “No Country for
Old Men,” based on Connac McCarthy’s
novel. Even more buzz has gone to actor
Javier Bardem who plays a ruthless killing

machine bent on recovering some miss-

ing drug money that found its way into the
hands of a hunter (Josh Brolin). Ian McE-
wan’s novel “Atonement” gets Joe Wright
(director of 2005’s superb “Pride & Preju-
dice”) treatment, with Keira Knightley and
James McAvoy starring as forlorn lovers
separated by deceit, war and other such
topics.

On the non-ﬁction front, Mike Nich-
ols’ “Charlie Wilson’s War,” based on the
George Crile book, ﬁnds Tom Hanks, Julia
Roberts, Amy Adams and Philip Seymour
Hoffman intertwined in the arming of
the Afghani resistance movement, whose
ranks included a certain contemporary
cave dweller and terrorist mastermind.

There is, however, lighter fare to be had.

background He talks about erncees “comin’

Han-is makes up a loose one-third of
PittRemix, a promotion group headquartered
at 92.1 WPTS focused on expanding the ex-
posure of local hip-hop culture to the students
and residents of Pittsburgh “With his partners
Corey Mizell and Isaac Goldszer, the group
has a mission to “give artists opportunities to
develop and strengthen the productivity and
quality of their music,” Harris explained

“We are out to bridge gaps,” the ﬁfth year
senior deﬁnitively stated "Ihe biggest gap for

and this campus. Eighty percent of students lis-
ten to hip-hop or are interested in some facet
of the hip—hop culture, wheﬂ1erit’s dancing or
grafﬁti art or whatever. They don’t realize we
have just as strong a hip-hop community here
with just as much to offer.”

hop community thrives is Pitt’s very own
radio station. Harris said, “Hip-hop has a
strong history at WPTS. DJs that were here
are now big names on the underground
scene. The problem was, once the great
people left, there was nothing, no one to re-
place them until another great person came.”

Ham's is now co—director of hip-hop pro-
gramming at the station along with Mizell. To
them, a local focus on the genre is imperative.
They promote and push as much as they can.
Harris points out that last year, he and Mizell
showcased Wiz Khalifa three months be-
fore the rapper appeared with Nas at the Pitt
Program Council show. “We put up the ﬁrst
posters; I gave a few CDs out to people. The
real buzz started with us,” he emphasized
The two also began to generate ideas on how to
build a foundation for hip—hop that would last
beyond any one particular DJ or show. ‘

Eventrlally, one of those ideas, PittRemix,
came to fruition, and Harris credits ﬂie radio
station for providing the right tools to allow the
project its functionality.

“PittRemix is really just a facet of the radio
station,” he explained. “We’re DJs, entertain-
ment personalities, emcees, whatever you want
to call it, working together at WPTS. Why do
things by yourself if we’re all doing the same
thing?”

It was that attitude that brought Goldszer
into the project, a junior who just started DJ ing
in earnest early this summer after working the
fraternity scene for two years. As a member of
the group, he is also one of its earliest success

stories.

mer, Goldszer explained, he was “working 30
hours a week in the station, working on [his]
scratching and beat matching while doing all
the technical work [of a radio show], too.” And
with lugging his own equipment to the station
every night, the project was too overwhelming
to leave him with much room for progress.

with him, and things started to take a progres-

“Marcus gave me the opportunity to make
something of myself,” Goldszer said “That’s
what he does. He opens the door, and if he likes
you, you can stay, and if he doesn’t like you, he
lets you leave out the window.” I

But Hanis is equally appreciative of Gold-
szer because the young DJ is areal-life example
of what PittRemix embodies in its philosophy.
‘The station is here for the taking,” Hanis ex-
plained “[Mizell and I] want to ﬁnd new peo-

lVlH moves his entire body when he talks into
the microphone. They rap along with the jams

“I would’Ve had a show ﬁeshman year
ifl knew [the radio station] was here, in this
building,” ' Goldszer explained “With the
amount of ﬁm I’m having and the time I put
into it, there_’s no telling where I’d be today.”

“You know he talks about having fun,”
Harris chimed in, “and that’s the point. We re-
ally enjoy it. Most of the guys that work with
us, that come through for Beats and Brews, are
my friends, too.” .

In fact, everyone is a friend of the PittRem-
ix crew on Saturday nights from 10 p.m. to 2
am. at Spice Cafe. The vibe ﬂows through the
entire crowd as local emcees take their turn
with the mic and the Remix DJ s lay down taut,
layered beats. It’s a change still unnoticed by
bigger press in the city, but the Atwood Street
bar transfomis into Oakland’s own explosive
underground l1ip—hop scene for those four
hours every week

“Beats and Brews” is the brainchild of Har-
ris and his crew. “I had the idea for awhile, but
I had criteria,” he explained To put it into the
making, there had to be certain elements in-
volved “I wanted it to feature local hip-hop. I
wanted it to be in Oakland I wanted the [radio]
station to be_ involv .” .

Most of all, though, Hanis emphas' I
that it had to be a show. “It’s not just a. mix
of DJs comin’ up perfonning. It’s a show.
There are opening acts, headliners and pro-
motions. If you come, there’s a good chance

you’re gonna leave with a T-shirt or get a "

free shot. There’s a good chance you’re gon-
na have a good time,” he added

While still only in its infancy, PittRemix
seems to be successfully fulﬁlling its mission
statement and having its own good time while
doing so. Most of all, the boys are optimistic
for the future — not just the group’s own, but
the future of hip-hop in Pittsburgh.

“I really believe that hip.-hop in Pittsburgh

is heating up, that there’s gonna be a big move-

ment soon,” Hanis concluded. “That, or we’re
all just gonnaf ' .”

“Nah, man, don’t say ﬂiat,” Goldszer piped in. ‘

Harris laughed and conceded Then he quali-
ﬁed it: “All or nothing, man, that’s what I’m
saying. All or nothing.” i .

The Pitt volleyball team traveled to
Big East foes St, John’s and UConn this
weekend, losing to the nationally ranked
Red Storm before defeating the Huskies.

“We played pretty well, but offen-
sively we weren’t up to our usual stan-
dards,” head coach Chris Beerman said.
“I thought our defense was excellent, our
blocking was A great and we dug really
well.”

The loss to No. 19 St. John’s ended a
three—game winning streak for the Pan-
thers (9-8, 3-1 Big East) and marked the
team’s ﬁrst loss of the year to a Big East
opponent.

St. John’s took three out of four games
Saturday, including a crushing 30-12 vic-
tory in game three. The Panthers respond-
ed Sunday, sweeping the Huskies, 3-0.

Junior Kelly Campbell recorded her
seventh double—double of the year against
St. John’s with 16 kills and 10 digs.

Also, sophomore Meagan Dooley had
a match—high 15 kills against UConn.

“Dooley was great this weekend,”
Beerman said. “She was awesome as a
blocker against St. John’s and deﬁnitely
our best performer against UConn.”

Sophomore Michelle Rossi had a
team-high 17 digs against St. John’s and

It’s not a good year to be a Pitt offen-
sive lineman: Pitt lost its third for the sea-
son yesterday when it was released that
tackle Jason Pinkston will miss the rest
of the season because of shoulder surgery
he will undergo this week.

Pinkston, a sophomore, will not lose a
year of eligibility and will take a medical
redshirt. I

Pinkston injured his shoulder against
Michigan State Sept. 15 and hadn’t
played since. The Panthers lost fresh-
men Chris Jacobson and Dan Matha for
the year in training camp, and both Mike
McGlynn and Joe Thomas have been bat-
tling injuries all season, McGlynn recov-
ering from offseason shoulder surgery.

a match—high 23 digs against UConn.
“Rossi was terriﬁc both games,” Beer-

W man said. “She really frustrated the out-

side hitters for both teams, who couldn’t
put the ball away cross-court, and that’s a
credit to her making all those plays.”

Pitt hosts Big East opponents Seton

House this weekend, playing the Pirates

Game one was tied at seven when the

Trailing 25-19, Pitt mounted a come-

For the second week in a row, the

Pitt women’s soccer team split its pair .

of weekend matches, stunting momen-
tum in the heart of its Big East sched-
ule.

After losing to West Virginia and
beating Ohio last weekend, the Pan-
thers beat Syracuse at home on Friday
but lost at St. John’s Sunday.

“We’ll look to regroup and work on
some things this week in practice,” Pitt
head coach Sue—Moy Chin said.

They’ll have something to work
with —- ‘the play of Panthers goalkeeper
Alison Finch. _

Finch continued_ her strong play in
the 2-1 win at home against Syracuse,
making six key saves to keep the game
in Pitt’s control.

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

“Alison’s played great all year,”
coach Sue—Moy Chin said.

Along with six victories, Finch, has
recorded three shutouts for the Pan-
thers, just two away from tying Pitt’s
all-time record for shutouts in a sea-
son. A

After a strong showing against
Syracuse, though, Finch and the Pag-

thers (6-4-O, 1-2-0 Big East) couldn’t '

get anything going Sunday afternoon,
dropping their match to St. John’s,
4-1.

Pitt continues Big East action at
home this weekend, facing Cincinnati
Friday night and Louisville Sunday af-
ternoon.

In game two, a kill by Campbell start-
ed a run where Pitt scored 12 of the next
17 points to tie it at 13. From then on, the
game remained close with neither team
taking more than a two—point advantage.

Pitt held a 29-27 lead, but St. John’s
tied the game. The Panthers were able to
score the ﬁrst two advantages but couldn’t
put away the Red Storm just yet.

Then, after a St. John’s attack error,
another Campbell kill gave the Panthers
a 35-33 win in game two.

“I think people are starting to key on
her more,” Beerman said of ‘Campbell.
“But she’ll' be able to adjust to that.”

Game three was tied at ﬁve before the
Red Storm went on a 15-of-18-point run
to take a commanding 20-8 lead. They
would go on to win 30-12 and take a 2-1
lead in the match.

A kill by junior Stephanie Ross tied
game four at 18, but the Red Storm would
then take the next ﬁve points and a 23-18
lead. Two straight kills by Dooley and
senior Diana Andreyko brought the Red

Campbell tied the game at 26 with a
kill, but St. John’s took four of the next
six points to win the game, 30-28, and the
match, 3-1.

Pitt 3, UConn 0

All three games were close as the Pan-
thers recorded their ﬁfth shutout of the
year.

Pitt won the ﬁrst game on a Huskies
(11-5, 2-2 Big East) attack error. Thanks
to thel0 UConn attack errors, Pitt won
game two, 31-29. I

Game three was tied 10 times and
also included ﬁve [lead changes before
the Panthers won, 31-29, for the second
straight game.

Andreyko tied the game at 25 with
one of her six kills. Then a Ross kill gave
Pitt a 27-26 lead and it won on an attack

‘error by the Huskies.

“I think overall we feel pretty good
about ourselves,” Beerman said. “We’ve
just got to keep the momentum going.”

fensive effort to overcome a second
half surge by a talented Syracuse team,
snatching a 2-1 victory Friday night at
Founders Field.

Jennifer Kritch scored in the 27th
minute for the Panthers when sopho-
more Ashley Habbel streaked down the
right side of the field, beat her defender
around the corner and delivered a cross
that Kritch pounded into the back of
the net.

Syracuse couldn’t do much of any-
thing in the first half as the Panthers
dominated in all aspects of the game,
possessing the ball on offense and
applying pesky defensive pressure
throughout.

Janean Gardner seemingly put the
game away just two minutes into the
second half when she headed in a Lau-
ra Berbert corner kick, to put Pitt up,
2-0. 1'

But the Orange wouldn’t yield, an-
swering with a corner kick of its own
in the 62nd minute, resulting in a Me-
gan Bellinghamgoal.

Pitt’s offense stumbled somewhat
as the half continued, and Syracuse
used high pressure and energy to cre-
ate scoring chances. I -

- With just 10 seconds left, Syracuse
was given a golden opportunity to tie
up the game and force overtime but

couldn’t convert on a corner kick as

Finch came up big and pulled the ball
in, ending the threat and the game.

After limiting the Syracuse offense
to just three total shots in the first half,
the Panthers relied heavily on Finch in
the second half, who came up with four
clutch saves.

Syracuse dropped to 4-4-2 overall
and 0-2-0 in the Big East.

Chin was very happy after the game
with her team’s effort. '

“It was a physical game,” Chin said.
“We were able to slow it down and pull
it out when we needed to. I feel really
good about the win.”

‘ October 2, 2007

Pitt couldn’t get anything going on the
road as St. John’s jumped to an early
lead and didn’t let up, dropping the
Panthers in a 4-1 decision — the same
margin by which the Pitt men’s team
lost to the Red Storm men’s squad last
weekend.

“We just came out really slow, and
they jumped on us early,” Chin said.
Just 22 minutes into the first half, the

Red Storm already held a 3-0 lead on’

goals from Kelly McConnell, Tara

Mendoza and Krystle J alalian.

St. John’s continued to pressure
the Panthers offense and attack the
defense, taking nine total shots in the
first half and blanking the Panthers in
that same category.

Pitt came out stronger in the second
half, tallying a goal from a Laura Ber-
bert free kick 22 yards out. '

It proved to be the only score for
Pitt, though, and St. John’s responded
with more of the same tough and ag-

gressive offense, scoring once again to
put the game out of reach in the 77th
minute. _

“We played a lot better as the game
went on, but we were stuck trying to
play catch-up,” Chin said.

St. John’s out-shot Pitt, 13-4, put-
ting eight of those shots on goal and
allowing Pitt just two. 4-.

With the win, the Red Storm upped
their record to 7-1-2 overall" and 2-1-0
in the Big East.
