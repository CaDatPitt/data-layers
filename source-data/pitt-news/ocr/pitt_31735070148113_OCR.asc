State senate passes bill to
ban   texting while driving  

_ Brendan Owens
For The Pitt News

Mixed emotions surround a bill
that might make Pennsylvania
join the list of 33 other states that
prohibit texting while driving.
The bill, which the Senate
passed last Wednesday and‘ awaits
consideration by the House and
a ﬁnal decision by Gov. Tom Cor-
bett, would attach a $100 ﬁne to
drivers who are caught using
their cell phones to text, call,
email, browse the internet and

instant message while behind the .

wheel. _
The bill’s primary sponsor,

The Senate bill would make

- texting while driving a primary

offense and the law would allow

officers to pull over offenders if

they see them texting. The bill

‘would make talking on a cell-

phone while driving a second-
ary offense, meaning that officers

can only cite an offender if they .

ﬁrst pulled the driver over for a
primary offense.

Now the bill will go through
the House, ‘where some legislators

have stated that they would prefer S

that the law should place the same
restrictions on any cell phone use
that it does in "texting.

In addition, Corbett said he
believes the legislation is a good

state Sen. Tommy Tomlinson,

need to pay more attention while
driving and not deal with extra

- idea but wouldn’t comment on

whether he would sign the bill

,or not.
“We are supportive of the‘

concept and believe in protect-
ing citizens with regard to dis-
tracted driving, but at this point,
the exact language of such legisla-
tion is still in discus'sion,” Corbett
said. “ T ‘
Many studies have suggested

‘ that drivers take a huge risk‘ if

they choose to text while behind
the wheel. Car and Driver maga-
zine conducted a study that con-
cluded that texting while driving
is more dangerous than drinking
and driving. Participants in the
2009 study had slower reaction
times when texting and driving
than when they were drunk driv-
ing. _ - .
In 2009, 2.0 percent of injury-
related vehicle crashes involved
reports of distracted driving,
Tomlinson said.

Sixteen percent of all driv-
ers younger than 20 who were
involved in fatal crashes were're-
ported to have been distracted

while driving and the age group A

withlthe biggest proportion of
distracted drivers was the under
20 age group,’ according to the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. V S

at

Pitt ﬁnished in the top 10 in a recent survey
that measured the per—dollar value of institu-
tions’ academic research. '

Jeffrey Litwin, an associate dean at George
Brown College, conducted a study that ranked
Pitt eighth out of 72 universities in terms of
publications per—dollar of federal research
funding. ,

Litwin used total research expenditures
—‘_— deﬂated to 1996 dollars — divided by the
total number of articles published in peer
adjudicated journals each year to arrive at his

rankings. The list ranks the schools in rising ,

order of spending per publication. _
Pitt also ranked eighth out of 72 universi-
ties in a 1989—based calculation with $44,990

in total cost per publication and ﬁnished.

eighth again in 2004 standings with $68,460
per publication. ’
~ Litwin called that a “pretty good result
from a productivity perspective. Most univer-
sities moved around quite a bit in the ranking
over the years.” - ~
In 2004, Pitt spent $398,581 in total fed-

eral sponsored research expenses as opposed
to ﬁrst—ranke.d Harvard’s $468,313. That.
number for Pitt rose to $532,776 in 2010.
Boston University also came in atop the
list, whereas other high proﬁle schools like
MIT and Johns Hopkins ﬁnished near the
bottom, as they place less of an emphasis on
publishing their research. . . ' ‘ I
i “I retrieved ‘the research expenditure
data from the National Science Foundation
WebCASPAR site and the publication counts

_ from Thomson Reuters’.Web of Knowledge,”

Litwin, who used a three-year average to
determine the values, said. “The process was
simple enough. I retrieved the data and did
the calculation.” 8 f
Pitt has made great strides from a research
standpoint. In the Department of Neurosur-
gery, the University has helped lead innova-
tion in areas such as brain-tumor manage-
ment, stereotactic radiosurgery, movement
disorders and vascular malformations.
‘ Meanwhile,'Pitt’s McGowan Institute has

' emerged as one of the leading bioengineering

programs in the country. In September 2003,

Students, lawmakers

support texting ban

Texting 4 2

Others opposed the bill’s most stringent
provisions. -

Pitt information sciences professor Paul '

Munro said, “It should be illegal. It should
be a primary offense.”

Recent Pitt biomedical engineering
graduate Taylor Bissell agreed.

“People should keep their eyes on the
road and their hands on the wheel while
they’re driving. You don’t need to be tex-
ting,” she said.

But some students are raising concerns
about making texting a primary offense
rather than a secondary offense, even
though they believe it is extremely dan-
gerous.

Elijah Barrad, an engineering major, is
one of those students.

“Texting is definitely more danger-
ous than talking,” Barrad said. “Obvi-
ously people do [text and drive] and they
shouldn’t, and I’m not going to say I don’t,
but it’s tough to have it as a primary of-
fense, because you could be doing any-
thing. It should deﬁnitely be a secondary
offense.”

tana, ‘D-Allegheny, is delighted withthe .

legislation and believes that this is a bill the
residents of Pennsylvania want enacted.

“I think the people of Pa. want a texting
bill. They want to have some lawthat would
prevent texting while driving. This is the
ﬁrst bill that has made it as far as it has
in the senate, so I am more than happy to
support a bill that the people of Pa. want,”
Fontana said. ”

The bill would also restrict the number
of passengers a juniordriver can have in
his car and would make failure to wear a
seat belt a primary offense for drivers with
passengers who are 8-18 years of age.

State Sen; Edwin Erickson, R—Chester/
Delaware, another co—sponsor, is glad the
bill was passed, but believes that the law
should be more strict. » 1

“I am pleased to see we ﬁnally took ac-
tion,” Erickson said. . _

“I would like to have seen the law stron-
ger. I would have liked to see the use of
handheld cellphones as a primary offense.
I think we need to take some action, and
if we need to strengthen the law later on,
we can do that.” I

That Time of
the Month

A made-for-TV sequel

Mark Wilkinson must not have
been familiar with the concept of
self—fulﬁlling prophecies when he
purchased a 16-foot cabin cruiser
named “Titanic II.” As he was pi-
loting his boat back into the West
Bay, England, harbor after aﬁshing
trip — the ship’s‘ maiden voyage
—- the hapless captain soon found
his vessel sinking inexorably into
the Atlantic Ocean, AFP reports.
Unfortunately, as James Cameron
fans might have predicted, the
Heart of the Ocean II could not be
retrieved.

Crimes of fashion

Eighties trends are back invogue
+‘even, it seems, among lawbreak~
ers. Federal authorities are on the
lookout for the nefarious “Mullet
Bandit,” an Ohio—area bank rob’-
ber sporting an unusually long crop
of hair, Reuters reports. Unfortlu-A
nately, the odds of the police ﬁnding
this criminal are against them: In
any other part of the country such
a haircut would stand out; in Ohio,

it’s the perfect disguise. .

Not‘-so-good will

Turns out you can buy more
at Goodwill than just secondhand
T—shirts — at least at the Fenton,
Mich., branch. State police are
searching for the owner of a box
labeled"‘grand'ma’s urn,” which

contained a capsule full of what
appears to be‘ cremated remains.
Although this situation might seem
macabre to some, we urge our read-
ers to look on the bright side: This
grandmother no doubt received a
very discounted burial.

Extreme Zoology

One can only speculate what
was running through a Washing-
ton man’s head when he entered
his girlfriend’s ex—boyfriend’s apart-
ment toting a mink carcass. When
the ex-boyfriend asked why he was
carrying a weasel, the man alleg-
edly responded, “It’s not a weasel,
it’s a marten,” and then punched
him in the nose and ﬂed, MSNBC
reports. Although the assailant
misidentiﬁed the animal, The Pitt

News can commiserate: We’ve had

equal difﬁculty telling a hawk from
a falcon. . “

Retaking the ﬁeld

Let the intrastate trash talking
commence: Yesterday, Pitt and
Penn State announced the two
schools would renew their storied
football rivalry, beginningwith a
game in Pittsburgh on Sept. 10,
2016. The news is exciting for a
host of reasons -—— the match will
undoubtedly draw a great deal of
attention to both franchises —— but
more importantly, it’s a relief: We
no longer have to care about West
Virginia.‘

What do opinions columns, seemingly
hopeless situations, introductory
drawing courses and Einstein’s theory
of relativity all have in common?

The answer is simple but easily
overlooked: perspective.

Think back to the last time you
reached an impasse. Maybe you were
bogged down by an overwhelming
research project, exhausted with a

frustrating living situation or vocif—_

erously at odds with a coworker or
signiﬁcant other. The situation likely
seemed momentarily hopeless; the
challenges insurmountable, or at
least discouraging to the point of

inaction. '-
The key word here: seemed.
It’s afundamental truth oflife that

' how you look at things matters — and

more than in a glass half empty/half
full type of way. In the vast majority
of cases, it’s neither the scenarios nor
the challenges we face in our lives that

‘ cause us the most strife and lead to the

greatest losses. Instead, it’s the ways
in which we perceive and approach
them —- our perspectives.

You probably already know this,
to an extent. If you’ve never been
told to look at a situation different-
ly or broaden your perspective, I’d
venture a guess that you’d be in the

, overwhelming minority. These are

common phrases that characterize
a common problem-solving and co-

Perspective makes

operation—boosting strategy. What’s
less common is to see them sincerely
applied, even though the value of do-
ing so is nearly inestimable.
Writing this column, I tried to
think of examples of times I had
challenged my own perspective and
emerged better off. What I came up
with instead was largely a long list of
times that I had failed to do exactly
that. There’s no doubt that, especially
in the moment, takinga step back and
allowingyourselfto reform opinions is
a difﬁcult task. As I continued search-
ing my memory, however, I realized
that the circumstances under whichl

College is what .

. fulﬁlling moments of my life.

One in particular stands out. The
summer after my senior year of high
school, Iwas making preparations to
head off to Pitt. It wasn’t the college
I had wanted to ﬁnd myself at'in the
fall; in fact, whenl hadsubmitted my
free application duringatour, I hadn’t
even really considered attending. Yet,
ﬁnancially, itwas the best choice, and
it became my destination.

Irememberbeing surprised how,
at the moment my family and I made
the ﬁnal decision, I forced my percep-
tion of the situation to change. Iwasn’t
about to approach my college expe-
rience unenthusiastically. So I tried
looking at it the way my parents did:
Pittwas a guarantee of a quality edu—
cation at awell—esteemed institution.
And I held on to the positives in the
situation — the University wasn’tver_y
near home, itwas in a new city and it
would be my ﬁrst experience of public
schooling. Somewhere along the line,
I’ve forgottenwhat my original hesita-
tions toward Pitt even were. ,

Because I was able invthat one
instance to reapproach a pretty im-
portant situation, I have so far expe-
rienced two and a halfof the most
enriching years of my life. Coming
to a school I didn’t expect to attend
not only forced me out of my com-
fort zone, but it also allowed me to

embrace its absence. I don’t believe ‘

I would have had nearly as positive
an experience at this University if
I had ﬁrst arrived wishing I were
somewhere else. My perspective the
preceding summer and especially
those ﬁrst few weeks allowed for my
experience to happen.

Perspective is notpositive or nega-
tive — it’s simply a reality: alterable
but inescapable. We shouldn’t want

to escape it. The vital thing to recog-
nize is' the nearly all-encompassing
impact our individual perspectives
have on our lives. While we shouldn’t
seek to disown or disavow them, we
should also not content ourselves with
narrow deﬁnitions of correctness or
stubborn unwillingness to consider
other views. '

The next time you’re engaged in a M

disagreement, take a couple seconds
to consider genuinely the other per-
son’s view. And the next time you’re
faced with discouraging or frustrating
circumstances, try approachingthem
with the attitude that you’re going to
make it a personal challenge to make
the best of them. Inboth situations, a
simple reorganizing of one’s thoughts
can reveal new potentials that might
have otherwise gone unrecognized.
Perspective is a tool, a gift and
even sort of a power. It’s why statis-
ticians engage in multidimensional

analysis, why writers travel to differ- .

ent countries and why those‘ seeking
enlightenment meditate. For being so
plainly inﬂuential in all of our actions,
perspective is probably the most dif-
ﬁcult aspect of a situationto separate
ourselves from. And for being a vir-
tually universal experience, it is also
possibly the most impossible thing
that there is to share. But attempting
to do so is not only necessary for hu-
man interaction; it’s also personally
valuable. A fresh look at things can
change a rut into a channel to new
possibilities. _

Ultimately, perspective is what
we make of it. It can be a pessimistic
hindrance, or it can be an optimistic
impetus and a motivation to discuss,
interact and learn. Like most things,
it depends on how we look at it. Your
perspective’s up to you. I

Obama’s LGBTQ recordmerits

praise, not criticism 

Alicia‘Dlugos
Columnist

If you turn on the television to-
day, chances are you’ll be able to
ﬁnd some sort of representation
of the LGBTQ community using
10 or fewer clicks of the channel
button. Whether you frequent the

. Style Network or MSNBC, it’s no

longer surprising to ﬁnd a queer
person featured on screen. This
prevalence is mirrored in every-
day life: LGBTQ people are more
out and proud now than ever —
which makes President Barack
Obama’s June 1 acknowledgement
of this month as Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Pride
Month particularly ﬁtting.

But there remains discon-
tentment about how the LGBTQ

_ community is treated politically.

Obama’s supporters praise him
for his efforts to advance LGBTQ
rights, but others complain that
he hasn’t done enough. In my
view, however, Obama should be
applauded for every measure he
takes..

It might seem like LGBTQ
rights have been in the cultural
spotlight for a long time, but
their advancement is, in fact, a

relatively recent development — ,

it is often forgotten that sexual
acts between consenting same-
sex adults were illegal in some
states up until Lawrence v. Texas
in 2003. Right now, Vermont,
Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Iowa, New Hampshire and Wash-
ington, D.C., are the only states/
districts that have legalized gay
marriage, although others rec-
ognize civil unions between gay
couples. Some states, including

Pennsylvania, explicitly state in
their constitutions that marriage

‘ is a union between a man and ‘a

woman. This restricts gay couples
from certain rights like automatic
inheritance, spousal hospital visi-
tation, ﬁling a joint tax return and
spousal military beneﬁts.

This past year, then, has been a
promising one. In December 2010
Obama signed off on the repeal
of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which
banned openly homosexual ser-
vice members in the military, and
he declared in February that he
no longer supported the Defense
of Marriage Act, which stops the
national government from recog-
nizing same-sex couples in terms
of social security, taxes and other
programs.

Even still, many people I talk
to suspect that all the action the
president has taken aims more to
gain popularity from the LGBTQ
community and its allies than to
amend a wrong. When we look

at the aforementioned advance“-"

ments in relation to America’s
history, they’re big deals, but
when we look at them in com-
parison to the policies of many
other developed countries, we’re
still very behind: Many nations,
including Spain, Canada, Portu-
gal, South Africa and Belgium,
already recognize same-sex mar!-

riage. Obama has stated before

that he supports same-sex civil
unions butdoes not actually
support marriage between two
people of the same sex, which not
only leaves a bad taste in many
LGBTQ individuals’ mouths but
also inspires suspicion about his
dedication to the cause. A
Nevertheless, I’m with Obama’s

defenders on this one: This is a
case of “take it or leave it.” The
president mightnot be willing
to put his political career on the
line for the rights of the LGBTQ
community, but he’s done much
more than previous presidents
(let it not be forgotten that for-
mer President George W. Bush
refused to recognize June as LG’-
BTQ Pride month at all), and for
that we should be thankful.

I As far as I’m concerned, every
single political move made by any
politician will have underlying
motives, but that doesn’t make
the actions themselves invalid.
As a member of the LGBTQ com-
munity myself, I’m thrilled by
every baby step this country
makes in the right direction. I feel
very strongly about the need for
equality, but I also appreciate the
fact that, as with any civil rights
movement, it doesn’t happen
overnight. , .

Many people called Obama a
hypocrite after he stated in 2009,
“For even as weface extraordi-
nary challenges as a nation, we
cannot and we will not put aside
issues of basic equality,” claim-
ing he hadn’t done enough to
advance LGBTQ rights. Unfor-
tunately, these accusations will
persist until LGBTQ people have
the full rights of any other citizen.
Indeed, amidst all this, one thing
is certain: The LGBTQ community
will not stop pushing and push-
ing towards the direction of full
equality. And with that, I’m happy
to share: Pittsburgh was (surpris-
ingly) voted the ﬁfth Gayest City
in America by LGBTQ magazine
The Advocate this February. So
happy Pride! I '

Community cleans closets
and shop for old threads

Kate Leisher ﬁlls her Redd Up Thread Up bag — $10 regularly

Natalie Bell
ASE Editor

A gaggle of women dug through

A piles of clothes, unearthing styles

from as far back as the '70s. Some
of the clothes were old enough
to be trendy again whilesome
were never en vogue in the ﬁrst-
place. '

Ordinarily, clothes swaps
happen among friends of con-
veniently similar sizes, a social
way to refresh a tired wardrobe

and to shop without spending

money. But organizers for Redd \ .

Up Thread Up decided to take
that idea and transform it into a
community-wide event.

\ “I think, with clothing swaps,

people do them individually, .

among groups of friends, but not
on a community level,” event or-
ganizerjennie Roth said‘.

This Saturday was the second

. realization of Redd Up Thread

Up-—— the ﬁrst one in November
raised almost $270 to beneﬁt the
Women’s Center and Shelter of

Brooke Wieczorekl For The Pitt News

and $5 with a donation —- with clothing
submitted by other shoppers. The money raised beneﬁts the East End Cooperative Ministries.

Greater Pittsburgh -— and this
time the organizers raised $383

‘to beneﬁt the East End Coopera-

tive Ministries, which helps the
less—fortunate in the Pittsburgh
area. This summer’s Redd Up

included contemporary art mu-

THEATER PREVIEW ‘

Jekyll, Hyde sing
about good and evil

Liz Keeney
Staﬂ” Writer

“Jekyll & Hyde”

June 14-26 «
Directed by Robert Cuccioli
Benedum Center

Tickets start at $26.75
412-456-6666 or '
pittsburghCLO.org

The fight between good and evil
hasn’t changed much since Rob-
ert Louis Stevenson penned his
novella “The Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” in 1886.
Humanity’s struggle with the
dichotomy transcends time, be-

coming as relevant now as it was .

more than a century ago.
Now audiences in Pittsburgh
can witness the relevance of Ste-

'venson’s story when Pittsburgh

CLO performs the musical “Je-
kyll 8: Hyde,” written in 1990,
a century after the publication
of the book, this summer at the
Benedum Center.

The story revolves around Dr.
Henry Jekyll as he conducts his
experiments in Victorian London,
examining the dichotomy of good

Steve Cuden:

and evil in the human constitu-
tion. ButJekyll’s experiments go

* awry, and he becomes the animal-

istic Mr. Hyde. ,
The show is directed by Robert
Cuccioli, who played the role of

’ Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde during the

show’s original stint on Broad-

way, and features Kevin Gray
taking Cuccioli’s role as the male
lead.

Actors say that one of the most
important elements of the show
is its adherence to the original
text, particular character devel-
opment.

“It’s been really great getting

to work with Bob Cuccioli, and
just hearing what he has to say
about the_characters,” ensemble
member Michael Campayno said.
“Because it’s not really just an
ensemble, it’s kind of us creat-
ing these people, this lower-class
society in London, and it’s not
general at all.”

It’s that attention to detail
coupled with a continually uni-
versal story of good and evil and
a thrilling score that the cast bg,-_
lieves will draw the crowds in. 

Steve Cuden, one of the 1990
play’s original writers, explained
what he feels draws audiences
and readers to this story. His ver-
sion includes romantic entangle-
ments,Jekyll and Emma and Hyde
and Lucy, that were not present
in the book.

“It’s a classic story of good-

versus evil, and it’s a classic love

story, and audiences always re-
spond to this dichotomy of good
and evil and how it plays out in
this love relationship between
Jekyll and Emma and Hyde an
Lucy,” he said. J

was one of the ﬁrst pieces of literature to
examine this basic human dichotomy ——-
to quote the play, “the fine line between a
good man and a bad man.”

‘ “[The audience] get supercharged by
the notions of what happens to a person,
an individual when the worst of them is
let loose,” Cuden said. “‘]ekyll & Hyde’ is
a big, bold reflection of how that works,
and I think audiences are drawn to that
by and large because of its psychological
nature.”

The show asks its audience members
not only to question the line between good
and evil in themselves, but also to examine

it in the world around them. The element A

of questioning, whether it be of oneself

her as part of the show’s ensemble.

or society, is one of the reasons the story
has remained so relevant. It’s what many
of the people involved in the production
believe will keep audiences coming back
year after year. ,

Brynn 0’Malley, the actress portraying
Emma, Dr.Jekyll’s ﬁancé, ﬁnds the themes
to be enduring ones.

“Most of the themes that are addressed
in the show are very relevant today. It’s
obviously about good versus evil, freedom
versus restraint, order versus chaos, but
also science versus religion, in a way — not
so much at the forefront, but sort of an
underlying current, you know? What of our
soul is in control, and what is the soul, and
do we have control over it?” she said. I

Roth noted that the sale allowed for
less-expensive shopping than would a re-

places like Goodwill, particularly if shop-
pers brought in old clothes from their own

. “It’s a cool way to take a gamble and see
if you find a great dress,” Roth said.
‘Morgan Stewart, 27, was hoping to ﬁnd

ship resident had particular interest in
the event because shehas friends working
for the Saxifrage School, which plans to

She ﬁnds that Redd Up Thread Up’s

her organization’s ideals. Because of the
difficult nature of donating clothing to

When redshirt senior Chas Alecxih
ran into his new football coach Todd
Graham a few days after the coach
arrived, he asked Alecxih why the
defensive lineman hadn’t visited
him yet.

Alecxih, like other players on the
team, didn’t believe Graham at ﬁrst
when he told them to stop in every-
day.

“I was like, ‘Coach, you’re busy,”’

S ” Alecxih said. “But he said, ‘N o, Iwant

you to come see me.’ He really wants
us there every single day.”

The players are expected to see
their position coaches on a daily basis
as well, and Alecxih said that level
of Graham’s involvement is one of
the most noticeable differences from

formerhead coachDaveWannstedt’s A

style.

Wannstedtwas very involved with
the players, Alecxih said, but treated
the Panthers like aprofessional team

"and expected the athletes to handle A

their own business. .

“I think the biggest difference is
that Coach Graham and the staff are
really up in our business,” Alecxih
said. “I think I’ve had every class I’ve
taken this summer checked. They
don’t mess around with that stuff.”

Graham said that he believes it’s
a privilege, not a right to be involved

with a high—level football program, '

adding that he expects his players to

“set a new standard instead of adher-

ing to a minimum standard.

In light of a high-proﬁle NCAA
investigation at Ohio State, Graham
said that his goal at Pitt is to set a
standard of hard work and help the
players understand the rules and ex-

‘ﬁpectations.

. The Buckeye program is under-
going an investigation into players
exchanging signed equipment and
memorabilia to atattoo—parlor owner
in exchange for tattoos and cash.

ﬁg During the inquiry, Ohio. State

’ football coachjim Tressefand quar-
terback Terrelle Pryor left the pro-
gram. -

An Associated Press article said

that Tressel knew the players ac-

cepted benefits in exchange for

”*"Tnemorabilia and did not disclose
the information for more than nine M

months, breaking NCAA rules. He
stepped down in May. _ 4

Pryor; facingaﬁve—game suspen-
sion, decided to bypass his senior sea-
son last week. ' .

’ Graham said the coaching staff is
working hard to educate the Panthers
on their boundaries as players. He
added that the athletes are under a
microscope because of the different
sources they’re exposed to.

“Italk to them about going out
here and rattling off 10 or 11wins in
a row,” he said. “Everyone gets ex-
cited and things start happening. All
of the sudden they go to a restaurant
and somebody wants to give them a
complimentary meal.” A

Graham said it’s the utmost re-

. sponsibility of the coaching staff to’

be a positive influence on the team.
The coaches explained to the players
that therewillbe no short cuts or cut
corners.

. “It’s not worth winning and doing, 0

those things,” he said. “Sometimes
things can beneﬁt you for a short
time, but you’re going to be found
out. We’re not perfect, we don’t claim
to be perfect, butwe’re working hard
‘to make sure we go about things in
the right way.” ’ .
Quarterback Tino Sunseri said
‘that the events at Ohio State make
players realize that scenarios dis-

cussed at compliance seminars can

become reality. ' . .

‘ “To see it actually happen, it goes
to show you that everything you’re
doing is beingwatched and you need
to make sure you’re doing things by
the rules because stuff can happen,”
Sunseri said. ~ . _

, Last season, the Panthers faced off
the ﬁeld problems of their own. Four
Pitt players were arrested for violent
crimes over a period of three months
during the summer. Then Sports 11-
lustrated and CBS/ News released the
results of a six-month ‘investigation
that looked into the criminal records
of athletes on the 2010 preseason Top
25 college football teams.

Pitt had 22 players chargedwith a
crime —- more than any other team
in the preseason rankings. L

Graham wants the team to focus

in the classroom and contribute in I

the community.

“I believe that if we can get our
players to compete in the classroom
like they compete on the ﬁeld, you’d
win a National Championship, and it’s
the same thing with how they are in
the community,” he said. '

Sunseri said thatas the players are

Graham focuses on integrity‘

. becomingmore accountable, they are .

startingto see results on the ﬁeld,
which has led to a higher level of com-
mitment from the team.

The Panthers started player-led '

workouts this off-season, Sunseri
said, something they haven’t done
in the past. Sunseri said their goal is
to ‘simulate game. tempo and make
‘sure that the team understands the -
signals so that by the time training
camp begins in August, the players
are reacting and playing instead of
thinking. .

“Each week you can see guys get-
ting more in shape, you can see guys
getting stronger, you can see guys
getting faster,” Sunseri said. .

The biggest irnprovementfor the
team is its level of conditioning, Sun-

’ seri said. In the spring, players would

get tired from rumiingaround within
the ﬁrst couple of periods. '
“But now we’ve been running so _

much and lifting, you see guys out
here and We’re fresh,” he said. “That’s
the biggest thing with this tempo of-
fense, you’re not ableto go back to -the
huddle and get yourfeet underneath

you. You need to be able to have max ’

effort over and over again,” .

' Graham said the work the players '
put inbefore training camp inAugust
is especially importantforthe season

' ahead. «

f‘The team that is going to be the
Big East champion is the team that
invests the most, that has guys that
are unselﬁsh and understand that
there’s only going to be one [cham-
pion],” he said. - _

Although many coaches focus
on players’ physical development,
Graham stressed the importance of
mental preparation. . I

“The key for us to be successful
is to go high-octane,’ fast tempo, but
efﬁcient,”-he said. “It doesn’t do you
any good to go fast and hard if you
_make mistakes.” W

Graham said the most important
factor in determining the success of
the football team next season is the.
players’ belief in the system and their
understandingofhis expectations. ‘

“The problem right now is that we
have guys who think they are ‘all in’ I
that have one foot in,” he said. “We’ve'
got to get everybody completely all i
in.

“It’s not talk. Giving a speech is
not giving a leader,‘ it’s about a walk.
The key to winning, is developing
personnel.” I » V

Senior Chester waited through about 800

“I knewlhadachance, I just didrftknowwhere

For Chester, the next step is a move to Florida.
There hewillplay forthe Red Sox’s rookie ball club.
After that, his future is undetermined.

“You need to go from there and keep advanc-

Chester made anarne for hirnselfthis yearas a

St. Louis Cardinals took the right—handed pitcher

Bakeris the all-time winningestpitcher in Pitt

Game honorsteams-’ history

Rivalry < 1

Curley said. “There have been  memorable
Penn State—Pitt games, featuring outstanding
players and coaches, and we look forward to

playing the Panthers again.”

Penn State’s future scheduling commitments
will prevent the series from becoming armual
right away, Pederson said, which might cause the
rivalry game to disappear again for afew years.

“I know they have some scheduling com-
mitments out for a ways so it may not work as
quickly as he might hope,” he said. “Butwe kind

V of felt like here’s an opportunity to play two great

games, so let’s get this.thinggoing.”- ' .
Hardly aseasonwentby since 2000 without
speculation of when the two teams would meet

“I don’t think anywhere I’ve been that I’ve
talked to alumni, lettermen and fans that they
haven’t mentionedthis as our greatestrivaliy and
the importance of this game,” Graham said. -

Graham said former players talk about the

game as “the” rivalry for Pitt.

“I remember some very physical, hard-fought‘

games,” Graham said. “Growing up in Dallas,

'1 watched the games, so that tells you how 

out that reached. I’m big on the history of the
game, [of football], and I think these games are
important.”

Pederson said that Graham and Patemo
both supported the prospect of renewing the

rivahy.

Ina news release, Pitt Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg said tlrattlreiathleticrivalryis consistent
with the academic and civic relationships shared
by the two universities.

“The renewal of ourfootball rivalry is consis-
tent with that broader relationship, is good for
both universities, will be welcomed by college

« football fans around the country and presents

another important opportunity to showcase
Pennsylvania, the home state that we proudly
share,” Nordenberg said. ,
Graham said he also expects the Pitt-Penn
State games to help recruiting, starting with the
class of 2012. , 0
“When you can tell kids that you’re going to

play Notre Dame and Penn State, those are the -

type of games that kids want to play in,” Graham
said. “I talked to former players and the guys
that play in these games and won these games.
The memories that these games create for our
players really enhance recruiting.”

(The Panthers also have Notre Dame on their
schedule for 2016 and 2017. '

Resumingthe contests between Pitt and Penn
State means more tl1an just-renewing a rivalry,
Graham said. It also serves as a sign of respect
for the schools’ shared history.

“Anything that creates excitement for our

. program also gives respect and honorto the past

and to the future to know that this tradition is
going to continue,” Graham said. .
