Strang ys

These certainly are different times. Midterms are over, and it's still too early to begin studying for finals. So, Pitt students are perplexed with
the enviable task of finding something to do. This photo was taken with a fish-eye lens by Pitt News photographer K. Knox Carter while he
was lo_oking for something to do. i ‘ ‘

Frazier said vandals ’shall be dealt with severely’

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer \

The BAS shanty on the lawn of

the William Pitt Union was des— '

troyed by vandals on both Friday
and Saturday nights, said two of
the shanty’s builders.

J. Jonathan Robinson, BAS-pub-
lic relations chairman and one of
the builders, discovered the des—
truction early Saturday morning.

He was doing a radioprogram
at WPTS from 9 p.m. Friday to 1
a.m. Saturday. When he arrived
at the student union’, the shanty

was untouched. When his show
was done, he looked out the win-

dow and saw that someone had‘

ripped the shanty down.

Robinson hadn't heard any‘

noises, nor did he seeuanyone
when he discovered the van-
dalisrh.

An unidentified witness later

. informed Donald Frazier, execu-

tive assistant of the BAS, that four
persons were_seen running from
the scene.

Both the BAS and the Students
for a Free South Africa shanties

were reportedly empty at the

time.

”They had taken [their] time,”
said Robinson. ”The nails were
pried apart, and the walls were
torn down.”

Robinson said he noticed that

‘someone had scrawled

”Re—
invest Now” on one of the walls
with what appeared to be black
crayon.

Robinson enlisted the aid of
some BAS members to partially
rebuild the shanty that morning.

At 2 p.m., Robinson walked by
the -shanty and saw that all was
well. That night, it had collapsed
again. ,

”The strange thing was that
only the BAS shanty was at-
tacked. The Students for a Free
South Africa shanty was not
touched,” he said.

Robinson believes that the _

shanty was torn down by in-

dividuals who do not agree with ,-

the views of the pro-divestment,
anti-aparthveid movement. A

’’I would even go as far as to
say that there was bigotry in-
volved [in the action],” he said.

lskandar Al-Khemi, who con-
structed the framework of the
shanty, definitely believes that
bigotry was involved.

”lt was a racist and reactionary

action that brought about the col-
lapse of the shanty,” he said.

North Koreanleaderaliveand Still in POWEI‘   "

SEOUL, South Korea — North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung, who
had been reported slain or oust-
ed in a coup, made an official ap-
pearance today in Pyongyang,
greeting the Mongolian premier,
the official North Korean news
agency reported. , .

A photograph also distributed
by the Korean Central News
Agency showed the 74-year-old
Kim shaking hands with Zham-
byn Batmunkh in an airport wel-
coming for the Mongolian leader.

An Asian diplomat in Pyong-
yang, contacted by telephone
from Peking, told the Associated
Press that he had seen Kim at the
airport and ”he is in absolutely
good health.”

”Everything is all right in this
country, the situation is absolute-
ly normal,” the diplomat said,
speaking on condition that he not
be identiﬁed. ”There seems to be

nothing correct about these
reports [of an assassination or
power seizure].”

The photo and an earlier report
by the Korean Central News
Agency and Radio Pyongyang on
the airport greeting dispelled
rumors about the fate of Kim and
a struggle for control of this com-
munist" country of 19 million

which he has led since its crea-
tion in 1948.

Radio Press, a Tokyo-based pri-
vate monitoring service, quoted.
broadcasts as saying Kim was ac-
companied at the airport by Dep-
uty Premier and Foreign Minister
Kim Yong Nam and officials of
the ruling Korean Workers Party.

It said 100,000 people lined

A roads leading from the airport to

the city to welcome Batmunkh,
who is communist Mongolia’s
head of state.

A flurry of reports that Kim had

been killed or deposed began
Sunday when the defense minis-
try in Seoul reported broadcasts
of his death from North Korean
loudspeakers along the demilita-
rized zone that separates the two
Koreas.

Palestinians admit
they bombed club

BERLIN — A Palestinian ac-
cused of bombing a friendship
club in West Berlin admitted in
court that he and his co-defen-
dant smuggled the explosives
from East Berlin and carried out
the attack. Both men refused to

confirm their pre-trial statements
linking the plot to Syria.

The trial of Ahmed Nawaf Hasi,
35, and Farouk Salameh, 39, be-
gan Monday with an outburst
from Hasi, who shook his fist and
shouted that West Berlin authori-
ties were twisting his statements,
trying to confuse him and drive
him to suicide.

Judge Hans—Joachim Heinze
adjourned the trial for the day af-
ter Hasi asked to be returned to
his cell, and the proceedings re-
sumed yesterday.

The men are accused in the
March 29 bombing of the Ger-
man-Arab Friendship Society.
Nine people were injured, sever-
al of them seriously.

Hasi’s brother, Nezar Hindawi,
32, was convicted in London last
month in the attempted bombing
of an Israeli airliner in April at
Heathrow airport.

Renault president
killed in attack

PARIS —— Left-wing terrorists are
suspected in the shooting death
of Georges Besse, president of the
state-run Renault automobile
company, who was gunned
down as he returned home from
the company's headquarters in
suburban Boulogne-Billancourt.

There was no immediate claim
of_ responsibility for the 8’ p.m.
slaying Monday on Boulevard
Edgar Quinet near the Montpar-
nasse railway station.

Police said Besse ”very proba-
bly” had been killed by left-wing
terrorists and that they suspected
the Direct Action terroristgroup.

Direct Action has carried out

*1‘

dozens of attacks in France in re- 3

cent years, including the January

1985 assassination of Gen. Rene

Audran, responsible for French

arms sales.

Besse, 58, president of Renault
since January 1985, was hit sever-
al times in the head and chest.

New warden says

_ By Tim Landis

For the Associated Press

MARION, lll. — Soothing

earth-tone walls and gleaming,

ra2or—sharp barbed wire.

- The two images mix easily in

the view of Gary L. Henman,
who last June became warden of
the nation's toughest prison, the
U.S. Penitentiary at Marion.

The 46-year-old Henman is in
charge of a major, three-year
renovation inside the maximum-
security prison. He says he wants
to give the much-maligned prison
a more humane look. The work
began before he took over, but
Henman plans to add a personal
touch.

”l’m big on graphics and earth
tones. It gives you a little sense
of warmth,” Henman said. ”We
want to make the place as bright
and cheerful as it can be.”

He mentioned research that
shows certain ”soft" colors have
a quieting effect on behavior. In-
deed, quiet behavior is some-
thing there is often a shortage of
in the confining, -confrontational
world at Marion, where most in-
mates remain in their cells 23
hours a day.

"If it looks like a cage or looks
like a hole, that's what it is," Hen-
man said.

With that softer image in mind,
Henman ordered decorative
changes for the prison's interior.

  earth ‘tone

Security, however, is never far
from his mind. in addition to new
paint, inmates will be getting new
furniture — allof it made of con-
crete. Concrete bed frames,
shelves, tables and desks.

Something so seemingly in-
nocent as a chair leg or metal
footlocker can be deadly inside
Marion, Henman said.

”Metaland wood are prime tar-
gets for making weapons," Hen-
man explained.

There are no earth tones in
Henman’s view of Marion's ”mis-
sion," as it is commonly referred
to by the federal Bureau of Pri-

sons. That mission, according to

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - On
Tuesday a federal appellate panel
halted the execution of suspected

‘ mass slayer Theodore Robert Bun-

dy less than seven hours before he
was to die for themurder of a
12-year-old girl. ‘

A three-judge panel of thel lth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said .
there was insufficient time before
Bundy’s scheduled 7 a.m. electro-
cution to consider his attorney's
arguments, and that ”a stay of ex-
ecution is mandated.”

The ruling came less than three
hours after U.S. District Judge
George Sharp in Orlando refused

s may quiet prisoners

The majority of inmates eat,
sleep, write, read and even ex-
ercise in their cells: Educational
programs are piped in on televi-
sion. Mail and phone calls are
monitored. Contact visits are pro-
hibited. Inmates and visitors are
separated by glass and must talk
by phone.

Henman, who holds a doctor-
ate in socialwork, said he won't
engage in philosophical debates

with Marion's sharpest critic, the '

Marion Prisoner Rights Project.
He says he fully expects his at-
tempt to make Marion more
”cheerful" to meet with ridicule
from that group.

”You just can't win in those de-
bates," he said. ”lt’s a basic
philosophical difference."

Bundy granted stay

to halt the executionand after the

Florida. Supreme Court unani- 

mously rejected Bundy’s last-ditch
appeal.

Sharp, who issued his 19-page
order after almost seven hours of
consideration, wrote that Bundy
”failed to make a substantial
showing of a denial of a federal
right” in claiming that he was
mentally incompetent to stand tri-
al and act as his own attorney in
the 1980 trial. .

”The bottom’ line was that he
denied all the claims and peti- .
tions,” District Court spokesman
Al Donahue said. _

Bundy’s attorney, James Cole-
man, declined to comment on
Sharp's decision.

Student apathy
strikes the shanty

Apathy.

That word has been used again and again when people refer to
Pitt students, but we never expected apathy to strike the shanties.

It has.

Several times over the past week, members of this editorial board
have visited the shanties that were erected by Students for a Free South
Africa and the Black Action Society, respectively. Every time the shan-
ties were visited, they were empty.

When the first shanty was erected, the members of this editorial
board were under the impression that members of the SFSA and the
BAS would have students to occupy the shanties at least some of the
time. _

Where are they now?

Has the cold weather scared them away? Do they consider divest-
ment a lost cause?

The BAS shanty now lies in a pile of rubble. It has been like that
since the weekend. It was wrecked by vandals who took advantage
of the fact that the shanty was abandoned.

The BAS shanty is no longer a symbol of what blacks in South Afri-
ca go through. Instead, it is a symbol of student apathy.

' Rebuild it, and occupy it. Stand for what you believe in. But please
don't put two hours of work in rebuilding the shanty, then abandon
it again. .

If the shanties are not going to be occupied by students who sup-
port the divestment cause, then they might as well be moved to
Riezenstein Middle School where they can get some use. The par-
ents waiting for magnet school sign—ups can use them for shelter.

Scam: Beating the big guys

I was leafing through a maga-
zine the other day, and I glanced

at the cover to see a subscription .

label made out to Jackson Brown
— no relation. Jackson Brown at
times also subscribes to Playboy,
Mechanics and a host of other
weekly and monthly magazines.
He also belongs to several book
clubs and a record club — hope-
fully, he will soon belong to a
compact disc club. Jackson does
not exist, except in a few order.
blanks and in a collection clerk's
nightmare. Jackson is a member
of one of the world's other oldest
professions: scammingx

Many of you out there are
chuckling toyourselves, as you
belong to this profession, too. Oh
sure, you thought it was funny
when you joined the Columbia
Record rip-off under the name of
Adam Ant when they opened
themselves up for abuse with that
one-cent sale. Then the fools sent
you your 13 albums,,so you got
braver, . re-enlisting under the
nom de plume of Richard Nixon

MARK R.
BROWN

and a month later, Count Dracu-
la. And the albums kept coming!
A good scammer can net 300 al-
bums in a_ year, given enough
personality splits. I've heard tales
of a certain Jake La Mutta who's
had credit and repo men after
him for years. That's silly. How

are they going to get a Labrador.

to cough up any money?

It makes me wonder, when
people didn't know. how to
manipulate these masochistic

‘companies — and used their own

names — and they were getting
computer-printed threats from the
most dire regions of legal hell,
didn't they realize that not once
did anyon'e actually come after
them? Never did a collection
agency chase anyone down with
a subpoena — except in Jake's
case, but he should hang up the

idea of ever getting a Visa card.
Maybe he could get another one.

I wish that you could see the
day they. came after Jake. I've
never seen an armed bully force
his way intothe building before,
except when Giant Eagle wanted
-their shopping carts back. Any-
way, some duffer with a gun was
inquiring about M. La Mutta, who
was, in all his wisdom, sniffing
the investigator's polyester pant
cuffs at the time of the interroga-
tion/investigation. Do you have
any idea how hard it was to keep
a straight face through that? Jake
didn't break down and confess,
and we covered for him some-
how. The rent-a-schmo left in a

huff, muttering something un- _

printable about college smart
alecks.

I imagine that these companies
work out their losses somehow.
After all, they've been setting
themselves up for abuse for as

long as I can recall. But they. owe

it to themselves to investigate
their customers’ credit, though.

More letters on ’minding your own buisness'

Editor's Note:Due to the large
amount of mail received on this
subject matter and in order to let
everyone be heard, The Pitt

, News was forced to exercise its

right to edit and shorten letters to
the editor. While doing this, we
attempted to keep the main idea
of each letter intact. These will be
the final letters printed in
response to lanet Louise Martin's
letter of Nov. 72.

I just want to thank Janet Louise
Martin for giving me so much
new insight on life. I never knew

‘how oversensitive I must be. I

guess from here on out, if my
friends or I happen to be
punched, stabbed, robbed or
raped, I'll simply mind my own
business. After all, this newspaper
doesn't have anything better to
do than to persecute and dis-

I criminate against blacks. (Never

mind any of those anti-apartheid
articles we've been reading, eh,
Jan?) '
So, now that I've been straight-
ened out, I'm going to pick up an
"entertaining, informative and
uplifting” newspaper. I hear the
local newsstands are featuring the

Carlow Courier right between
The Enquirer and the Star. So,
thanks, Jan, and hey, mind your
own‘ business. If you're ever get-
ting the hell kicked out of you on
the streets of Oakland, I know
that's what I'll do.

Todd Zwikl

Political Science '88 -'

I am a junior at Pitt, and never
before have I been afraid to walk
the streets of Oakland. For some
reason, it's not safe here any-
more, not because I am a "poor,
sensitive” female, but because
the incidents of crime have in-
creased. You have no right con-
demning The Pitt News for
running a rape suspect’s sketch.

You seem to be oblivious to the

fact that The Pitt News is a.

”news" paper, and informing stu-
dents is of primary importance,
followed by your so-called "enter-
taining articles. ‘ ’

If you actually believe crime
isn't a problem in Oakland, wake

up and face reality.

Teri Mason

Pharmacy '89

I do not feel that The Pitt News
was attempting to make a racial
issue of the alleged suspect or the
crime. The Pitt News staff would
have eliminated a very objective
and informative fact had it not in-
cluded the suspect's skin color in
the general description.

Although The Pitt News has a
responsibility to entertain and in-
form, I doubt the staff can limit its
printed material to uplifting sto-
ries only. If The Pitt News avoid-
ed all depressing items, it would
be eliminating much relevant po-
litical and social news.

Victoria L. Erwin
Carlow College '88

If I or anyone else who's Cau-
casion were to say about blacks
what Janet Louise Martin said
about whites, there would be an
NAACP investigation. The issue
is crime and how to prevent it.
The young woman should con-
sider herself lucky that she hasn't
been victimized by crime and not
blame those who have not been
as fortunate. '

Tom Gigliett

A I want to know what is going
on when newspapers all ‘across
the country devote front-page
coverage to the issue of apartheid
in South Africa. I'm beginning to
think that all of this fervor over
white oppression is a sick case of
overkill. Why are you blacks hav-
ing so much trouble? My God, in
almost every newspaper I see,
you poor, delicate, sensitive
blacks are either being attacked,
robbed, raped or something.

I've lived here in Pittsburgh
since I was very young. I've lived
with the ugly face of racial vio-
lence in the public schoo|s_of
Greenfield and of Homewood.
These experiences have given me
feelings of anger — an impotent
anger because I am not violent -
and these experiences have given
me understanding. Ms. Martin,
on the other hand, qualifies her-
self as an expert because she is
a black student.

I guess those white bigots that
Ms. Martin knows so much about
don't have a monopoly on bigo-
try, do they, Ms. Martin?

I went back and read» the Nov.
5 article ["Burglar scrawls threat
on mirror”] and want to know,

‘ Ms. Martin, how you know the

women who were raped and bur-

. glarized were white. Not once in

the article was the race of the fe-
males mentioned. The only time
the race of the suspect was men-
tioned was in his description.
Since when is a police descrip-
tion prejudiced? It seems you are
discriminating against yourself by
assuming that the females were
white.

Pets rateNo. 1 with card industry

America evolves in wondrous
ways, and so it is that one of the
newest products being offered to
a waiting nation is a line of greet-
ing cards for pets.

The cards are intended tobe
presented to cats, dogs and other
pets on their birthdays, at Christ-
mas, when they are sick, etc.
There are 52 cards in the line, in
addition to cards meant to be sent
toownersfrom their pets.

The projects seems to have
been launched with a straight
face; the cards are not gags —
they are quite serious. A few ex-
amples:

— A card intended for a cat's
birthday features an illustration of
a cat playing with a ball of yarn".
The printed message is:”Happy

. birthday little gentle one/Please

have a special day/One that's
filled with kitty fun "and love
along the way/And when the day
is finishedand the celebration’s
through,/You will feel lavished in
the love that's given you! With
love onyou birthday.”

—— A card intended for a pet that
is ill and at the veterinarian’s fea-
tures an illustration of an empty
room with unused bowls of food

D r u gs —
Q. I'm! 78 but scared of boys
because quite a while ago I got

a little highwith a'boy and he ’

sort of tried to have sex, but he
couldn't enter. At the same time
I worry: Why couldn’t he? Could
a-gynecologist tell me? Some-
times I have bad menstrual
cramps. Would that have some-
thing to do with it?

A. You definitely should see a
gynecologistabout the cramps.
Before you go, write down all the
questions you have on your mind
on these subjects. You can type
the list or do it neatly by hand
and give it to the doctor, explain-

, ing that you don't want to forget

any of these things that are on

your mind. Be sure to ask if there

is any reason why intercourse
should be difficult for you and if.
cramps have anything to do with
that. ' '

I cannot answer these ques-
tions — I am not a medical doc-
tor. Often I have clients, in my
practice, go for a medical check-

At long last, the covert opera-
tions of the Reagan administra-
tion are beginning to get the kind
of recognition they deserve.

The shipment of arms--to Iran,
whether for the release of Ameri-
can hostagesor for the improve-
ment of relations, has incensed
the American population as never
before.

We were able to swallow the
deployment of Marines to Leba-
non. The summit in Iceland, with
Reagan displaying no clear poli-
cy and unable to field the Soviet
offer, was a little harder, but we
managed to stand behind the
president.

' Last month when the American
pilot Hasenfus was linked to
secret anns shipments to the Con-
tras, rumblings of high-level dis-
content began building to a roar
as the Iranian story began to
unfold. _ '

As we learned that the White

, » ‘House has madenumerous over-

 

and water. The printed message
is: "Get well soon dear little
friend, our home is not the
same/\/Ve miss the love you sprin-
kle ’round and all our little
games/\Ne need you here to give
us love and us to love you
back/Without you here its clear
to see we're really out of whack.
Hurry home!”

— A card -intended for a pet that
stays in the home city while the
family is away on vacation fea-
tures an illustration of suitcases.
The printed message is: ”Wish
you were here.  Our vacation

has taken us far away/As vaca-

tions often do/But you are there
traveling deep in our hearts/’Til
returning home to you. We'll be
seeing you soon!"

The cards are being manufac-
tured and marketed , by three
young entrepreneurs named Hel-
en De Witt, Karen De Witt (they

are sisters) and Bob Barber. They _

feel they may have tapped into an
important part of the nation's
mood.

”I work as a veterinary techni-
cian at an animal hospital,” said
Helen De Witt. ”Every day I see
how people feel about their pets.

  

BOB GREENE

People just dote on their animals.
I have really come to believe that
the emotions people feel toward
their pets are often stronger than
the emotions they feel toward
other people.” i

She said that she used to look
for greeting cards aimed at pets
and could never find them in
card ‘shops. ”And around Christ-
mastime at the animal hospital,
we get lots of cards from pets. ‘But
the cards are really cards
designed with humans in mind,

' with the pet's name signed on the

bottom. As far» as I know, before
we came along there were no

cards designed specifically for
pets.”

There is no supposition that a
pet will be able to read alcard,
she said. ”We don't mean this to
be taken as a joke. Of course pets
can't read. The idea is to buy the
card for the pet, then to read the
card aloud in the pet's oresenré
The pet will know that something
special is going on.”

Karen De Witt said that in ad-
dition to letting the pet know that
it is a special day, sending the
card "makes the human owner
feel better. ”It gives you a warm
feeling to do something like this
for your pet,” she said.

She said she feels the cards will
not be an overwhelming nation-
al fad, but instead will catch on
with a select group of consumers.
"People are entitled to think this
is silly, and I'm sure that's what
some people will think,” she
said. ”This is not for everybody
— nothing’s for everybody. It's a
fun thing that pet lovers will like.

”You’ve heard of pet owners
who buy a mink coat for their pet
or buy a diamond-studded collar.
Those aren't the kinds of people
we think will buy the cards.
We're not aiming the cards at

a bad introduction to sex

up to be sure that their problem
can be treated by sexual therapy.

I can say, however, that it is
likely that on their first attempt at
intercourse any couple — not just
inexperienced people — may fail
to do what they meant to do.
When the couple is young and
somewhat drugged, the likeli-
hood of failure is higher. The boy

may fail to gain entry because he _

climaxes so fast, or loses his erec-
tion or never has itbecause of
anxiety.

This is real life, not a movie or
soap opera. And a girl may be too
tense to permit entry. iOne or

' more of these mishaps happened . _
with you and that boy. I notice

that you say ”a boy tried to have
sex.” That sounds like no cooper-

ation from you —- perhaps some-

thing like passsive resistance.

And your‘distrust of boys‘

sounds as if he attempted entry
while you were fuddled by the
drug or temporarily separated
from your judgment. After that it
is natural for you to be more sus-
picious of males than before.

tures to the Iranian government,
including the shipment of spare
parts for their out-dated weapons,
the roar became deafening. It still
isn't clear that the Reagan ad-

ministration, quietly enthroned in ’

Washington's very ownivory
tower, even heard.

Since he took power, Reagan
has been hailed as a great and
charismatic leader, able to
change public opinion with 15
minutes of prime-time rhetoric.
All that has changed now, and
our people's view of the govern-
ment, not to mention that of our
allies, . has become more re-
served. '

In some places, reserved can
be read as scared. Our allies in
the Middle East are forced to
wonder which of their other ene-
mies will be getting American-
made "arms next.

The actions of the administra-
tion immediately following the
disclosure of any of the unsavory
events should be telling us some-
thing. The' first reaction for any
official is to say he wasn't in-
volved.

Everyone, from the Secretary of
State to the National Security Ad-
viser, claims that the action was

taken without their knowledge. -

Are we to believe that Reagan,
with his cowboy approach to for-
eign policy, was solely responsi-
ble for the actions?_l think not. '

All the situations scream for
resolution, for responsible leader-
ship. It is the job of the president
to lead the people with strength,
determination and ability. There
is no place for secrecy, misinfor-

_ mation and out—right lying." Some-
thing must be done before our-

credibility at home and overseas
is completely gone.

It is credibility that is our most
valuablenational asset. The ad-

flamboyant people. These cards
are for the average, everyday per-
son who loves his or her pet and
wants to show it.”

She said that greeting cards in- 4

tended for pets have a very
healthy potential for the humans
who send them. ”As strongly as

_ people feel about their pets, they

often have trouble expressing
those emotions because they

know that other people might
make fun of them. A lot of peo-
ple have very deep feelings about
their pets that they never have
been able to let out. Expressing
your emotions in an honest man-
ner, no matter who it's to, is a
good thing,” De Witt said. —
The question of why people
become so attached to their pets

is probably best left to psy-’ ‘I

chiatrists and psychologists, she
said. Everyone knows that pets
aren't human, but that doesn't
stop people from falling in love
with their animals.

”The fact is, pets become in-

tegral parts of people's families," .
she said. ’’All we are doing is *

recognizing that and treating the
pets like the beloved and respect-
ed family members they are.”

crashes, but to avoid unpredicta-
ble effects of the drug itself.
However, consider all the boys_
and men who ‘are interested in
you sober — you sober and them
sober. Boys and men who ap-«
proach you considerately, cau-
tiously, fihding out what -you

really want to do and don't want _
to do and the limits that you will ,
accept. It is not fair to suspect ’

them all of wrong intentions. Ad-

mit it. You do know guys like .

that. Do you think them unin-
teresting? I think you are wrong
if you do. Do me a favor and give
a few of them a try. .I

And if deep distrust of males
persists, go to a school counselor
and talk the matter over. You may
need some counseling or thera-

py to reinforce the idea that all of _

life is not people taking advan-
tage of each other. That and lots
of practice making and keeping
undemanding friendships with
trustworthy people, friendships
that you can keep, enhances your
life. One of them may turn into
"the love you dream of.

shipments to Iran were to im-
prove relations with the ”moder-,
ate” influences in Tehran.

Are these moderates more, ; 

valuable to the administration

than our allies who have become '  

disenchanted with the whole af-
fair? Are we ready to trade the

tenuous relation with Iran's un_- ' _
steady government for the respect ’ - j

of the rest of the world?
Again, I think not.

Where does Reagango from-‘ti j
here? Home to lick his wounds  l A
and be thankful he has no need

to be re-elected? To the TV~stu-‘
dio, nominally the Oval Office,
to persuade the American public?‘

Back to the drawing board? I

really don't know, and I think that ‘

with the examples we haveseen‘,

Students can learn about the

present and past state of health

care at the Student Health Fair to-
day and tomorrow.

”The purpose of the health fair
is to increase student awareness
of lifestyle behaviors as they re-
late to health and well-being,”
said Shirley Haberman, health
educator for the Student Health

The fair is featuring displays
depicting the current methods of
health care, such as nutrition,
stress management, fitness and
exercise.

”We want to be very upbeat
and positive,” Haberman said.
”We want to emphasize personal
responsibility in health care.”

In the first—floor gallery of the
William Pitt Union, the Health
Service has set up a historical dis-
play of outdated health care
practices.

”Back then, there was very lit-

n crash in a simulated car accident

Haberman said. ”We’re using the
historical exhibits as contrast to
the current state of health care.”

One of the items on display
will be an implement used for
bloodletting, an archaic practice
for the alleviation of disease that
was sometimes fatal.

”All the exhibits have to be in-
teractive so the students can get
involved,” Haberman explained.
”We want to create a learning ex-
perience.” ‘ -

Various university and commu-
nity health groups will be spon-

soring exhibits, letting the
students know what kinds of serv-
ices are available.

_ One of the displays will be
devoted to the promotion of
”mocktai|s,” alternatives to alco-
holic beverages.

This booth is sponsored by the
Student Health Advisory and
Drug and Alcohol Responsible
Education.

”We are going to stress preven-
tion this year,” Haberman said.

The fair is far from a mundane
display of health equipment.

There will be entertainment
both days by Beautiful Hands, a
Pitt group specializing in singing
and dancing in sign language, a
fashion show by Penny's and an
aerobic demonstration.

”There will be free food and
prizes,” Haberman stated.

Another attraction for the
health fair will be the Department
of Transportation's Convincer, a
demonstration of the effects of a
car crash. Students can ride a
padded chair down an inclined
track and feel a five-mph crash.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 19, 1986

Please tell me why my niece
won't pay a lot for a muffler

All right, so this one’s
personal.

It's about my niece and
nephew, to be exact.

Before you stop reading,
there is something you should
know —- I do not think they
are perfect or the best kids on
Earth. They even get on my
nerves sometimes.

It's also about growing up in
America in the 19805. Some-
thing most of you reading this
do not have to do.

To be the one who is giving
some sort of example to others
on how to live in this world
feels strange and, for some rea-
son, I keep wanting to go back
to the time when everyone
else watched me. _

Caroline is my niece. She -
has taken to a commercial that
has recently appeared advertis-
ing some muffler marketplace.
‘ Several days ago, she
strolled up to my mother and
said, ''I’m not gonna pay a lot
for this muffler,” or something
along those lines.

No one knows why.

I figure it's because she has
been seeing a little too much
television.

Most of us were brought up
on television and will admit
that a lot of the stuff we saw
was pretty bad.

I can remember watching
Three's Company religiously as
a kid moving quickly through
puberty. I see it now and real-
ly wonder what had me so in-
terested. Jack Tripper had his
moments, but altogether, the
show was rather stupid.

This makes me wonder
about the humor of my niece
repeating the words of a muf-

DIRK
KAUFMAN

LOOKING BEYOND

fler commercial. No one
taught her to say that.

This worries me.

If you think, as I do, that
everything a child learns in his
or her first years of experience
shouldn't be predetermined, I
think you're right.

I thought it was wrong when
the Supreme Court upheld a
ruling that parents may pull
their children out of school if
the parents feel what the chil-_
dren are learning could be
detrimental to them. '

Yes, children should learn
through the culture that they
will one day have to fend for
themselves in. But we're talk-
ing about a muffler commer-
cial here.

It just makes me nervous. B
The other thing that struck
me over the weekend involved,
a can of soda pop and my
nephew, David. '

My sister bought the drink
and handed it to Caroline. She
proceeded to spill some on
herself when she first took a
sip, then handed it to me after
each succeeding sip. She did
not want me to drink it, but
only to hold it for her while
she was occupied with other
things — such as repeating
everything her mother said and
copying everything her brother
did.

Well, along came David. He
wanted some of her soda. Like
any independent, young '80s-

type woman, she said, ”No,
it's mine.”

This wasn't the first time she
had done this, and it won't be
the last.

I liked it; my mother and her
mother didn't.

The previous day my mother
attempted to sit her down and
explain how much nicer it is_
to share. The speech was flow-
ery — about how if someone

had something that she wanted

part of,‘ she wouldn't be happ

if they didn't share. V

Yeah, yeah.

If I didn't know I would get
several cold stares from family
members, I'd tell Caroline to
guard what she has and take
what "she wants. This is the
'80s. She's a woman-to-be.
That's what women in the '80s
do. '

It's all a matter of survival.
Later, when David's reached
the ripe old age of two, he
will learn the same thing.
Everything will be even, and
the strongest will win — which
is great.

I realize I may be pushing
things a bit. She is tvvo-and-a-
half years old, and he is about
a year—and-a-half. Naturally, I
think they're both very bright
for.their respective ages. That's
what uncles are supposed to
think.

I-just hope she keeps fend-
ing for herself and,stops quot-
ing commercials. I can't help
but think things will be better
that way.

By the way, next week this -
column will be about a guy
who advises people on the
best uses of marijuana.

See what I mean?

The Children of War Tour is
ending its stay in Pittsburgh to-

day. The purpose of the tour is to .

share the problems that young

people have growing up in war-

ravaged parts of the world.
”The idea is to have American

kids get a glimpse of what life is

like for the children [in other
countries] and what hope they
have for the future and what
American kids can do,” said
Kathy Guthrie, a coordinator of
the tour in Pittsburgh.

The children that she is speak-
ing about are five students, all in
their teens and attending high
school, who have to live their
daily lives amidst gunfire and
military oppression.

One student from Lebanon
lives with ”fighting every day.

The school she attends has been
taken over by the military. Many
of her friends and family have
been killed or injured," accord-
ing to Reverend Robert White,
who is helping to oversee the
tour stop here.

Another student is from South
Africa, and although her family is
fairly well off and is granted many
privileges over the other black.fa-
milies, they still have few of the
rights that are taken for granted in
the United States.

The other three students are
from Guatemala, the Phillipine Is-
lands and the Marshall Islands.

Joining the tour from the Unit-
ed States is a young Navaho In-
dian. He is from the Joint Youth
area in northeastern Arizona. This
area is currently causing a conflict
between the Navahos and Hopis,
who claim to belong to the land,

and the United States, which
claims to own the land.

A Pittsburgh girl will also join
the tour when it leaves Pittsburgh
today.

The organizers of the tour are
hoping to involve the young peo-
ple by forming action groups to
promote awareness and also to
apply pressure for changes.

The theme of the tour is ”War
robbed them of their childhood
— Now they show us the way to
peace/’

Their tour in Pittsburgh includ-
ed visiting area high schools and
churches. Over the weekend,
they stopped at Schenley High
School, the First Presbyterian
Church downtown, and they
were interviewed on KDKA ra-
dio. Yesterday the students visit-
ed Winchester Thurston High
SchooL

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November I9, I986

The students also had a chance
to talk to University of Pittsburgh
and Duquesne University stu-
dents about many of the prob-
lems that they have in their
everyday life.

Their tour in Pittsburgh ends to-
day with a meeting at the YWCA
with the Youth Farm and then an
appearance on Pittsburgh Today.
The Youth Farm is an action
group that American kids formed
to find out exactly what they can
do to help.

The Pittsburgh Today show
will be aired on KDKA from 2-3
p.m. today.

In December, UNICEF will
take the ideas that the students
have come up with to see how
they can help with these plans.

The advisory committee for the
tour includes such distinguished
names as Harry Belefonte, Coret-

This tour is the second Chil-
dren of War Tour sponsored by
the Religious Task Force Educa-
tion Fund.

The first tour came in Novem-
ber of I984 and had 38 students
from 14 war-torn countries. The
tour covered 54 American cities.

This year's tour has 45 students
who will be touring 27 cities
across the United States. The tour
is divided into nine regions with
three cities in each region. Each
region has five students from for-
eign countries plus many stu-
dents from the United States that
have joined.

In October there was a benefit
rock concert held at Benedum
Hall Auditorium to support the
Children of War program.

Assistant Sports Editor

Editor's Note: Pitt quarterback
/ohn Congemi enjoyed a brilliant
career at the University of Pitts-
burgh. Tragically, that career
came to an end on Nov. I at the
Carrier Dome in Syracuse, N.Y.

Congemi took a hit in the back
while diving for a first down ‘ear-
ly in the game, and although he
returned to finish the game for

' Pitt, it’ was learned two days later

that the_ injury was worse than
everyone thought. _
Doctors advised Congemi to sit
out the rest of the season. Con-
gemi missed an opportunity to
finish out the season with a pos-
sible bowl appearance. Now

-those hopes are shattered. .

would have to be the Navy game
this year. It certainly rates up
there with the best of them. That

and also probably the Penn State

Q: Do you have any favorite
memories of great plays, ones
that youwould consider to be
your classics? .

A: None that really stand out.
I would say the one touchdown
pass against Penn State in my
sophomore year — the one that
put us up at the end of the game
— and also the two touchdowns

Pitt junior quarterback Joe
Felitsky will make his second start
of the season this Saturday
against the No. 2 ranked Penn
State Nittany Lions at Beaver

I Stadium.

That's a tough order of business
for any quarterback, especially
for an inexperienced Felitsky. But
he is looking forward to the
chaHenge.

"I'm always up for anything,”
said Felitsky. ”I’m just going to go
out there andgive it my best."

And his best looks quite im-
pressive. In last week's 20-6 win
over Rutgers, Felitsky played like
a veteran as he threw for 259

 yard s.

But the most surprising thing
about Felitsky’s performance was
his ability to avoid the _rush. On
Pitt's first touchdown in the sec-
ond quarter, Felitsky was able to
escape the grasp of a Rutgers line-
man and hit Billy Osborn in the
end zone. And, once again, in the
fourth quarter he avoided the
blitz before finding a wide—open
Michael Stewart for a 75-yard
reception that set up the Panthers’
game-clinching touchdown.

When he transferred to Pitt
from Notre Dame two years ago,
the book on Felitsky was that his
main strength as a quarterback
was his strong passing arm. Yet
he showed a natural ability to es-
cape oncoming pass rushers of
Rutgers, a team that blitzed nu-
merous times against the
Panthers. .

"I'm not afraid of a b|itz," saidj
Felitsky. "I never got blitzed so
much in my life as I did last week.
But we have a lot of receivers
who can catch the ball, and they
know when the blitz will be com-
ing. If they [Penn State] blitz,
somebody has to be open.”

Felitsky’s confidence in han-
dling the pass rush should help

against a Lions’ defense that has.
recorded 34 sacks’ in 10 games '

this year-.
However, he is still wary of

Q:But what about your injury?
I mean, it did come right before
the "big game” and all.

A: It came at the worst moment
it possibly ever could have

popped up because, like you.

said,.it was the big game against
Miami, and I think I would have
helped the team a lot if I would
have played in that game.

Q: But don't you think you've
helped them anyway? I've been
here watching you at practices,
and it looks to me like you've
been helping, and it seems most
of the team feels this way as well.

A: Well, a little bit. Yeah, a lit-

_tle bit. I just do whatever I_can
now and, ah, well, let's put it this
way — it's not as good as play-

ing, but I'm doing just what I can
do. . ’

Q: John, what do you feel you

Penn State's defense, which is led

by senior All-America candidate
linebacker Shane Conlan (5

‘ sacks) and defensivelineman Bob _ P

White (7 sacks). "l've seen Penn
State blitz a lot," said Felitsky,
"and when they do blitz, they get
the job done. They put pressure
on the quarterback.”

And,’ most likely, that's what
the Lions will try to do against
Pitt, knowing full well that
Felitsky is starting only his second
game since his senior year in high
school and playing his first road
game. '

”Joe Paterno is a great coach,
and it is in the back of his head
to put pressure on me and try to
get me rattled,” said Felitsky.
Yet Paterno isn't so sure what
he'll try to do. "We know how

well he [Felitsky] can throw the gt;

still trying to get a feel for him and
what he likes to do.”

That could be to Pitt's advan-I _'

tage because no one has seen

ly what kind of quarterback he is.

Is he a much" more mobile.

Or maybe he's a cannon-armed

A: Well, I think I improved
whenever I had the offense to do
it with. When I was a sophomore,
I improved with every game, and
then when I was hurt my junior

a little bit. Plus the offensive line
in my senior year really wasn't fit

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 19, 1986

We are only three days away

I from the annual Pitt-Penn State

grudge match. The big game.
Two universities: one rural, one
urban. Two battle-ready combat-

‘ ants, ready to meet on a cold field

in 

OK, I'll stop. Someone has to’

stop glorifying this football rival-
ry. Anyway, it's not a rivalry, it's
a hatred. Admit it, there's a strong
and deep hatred between Pitt and
Penn State.

It's a healthy hatred, though.
We hate them, and they hate us.
And West Virginia hates Pitt and
Penn State. The Lord apparently
wanted it that way.

OK, since I've given up any at-
tempts to write this column with
any objectivity, I guess I'll revel
in my childish loathing of the
Happy Valley persona. '

Seriously, what kind of a name
for a town is Happy Valley?
Sounds like a place the Grinch

would visit the night before
Christmas.

And let's talk about Joe Pater-
no. The man is considered a
mastermind, a legend in his own
time, one of the greatest coaches
who ever graced the sidelines
with His presence. ~

But let's face it, the guy's got
some problems. I'll try to list
them in order of their severity:

I . His glasses — I'm sorry ifjoe
has bad eyes, really. I have glass-
es too, even though I don't wear
them all that much.

But the thickness of the lenses
on'Joe’s glasses must be beyond
the legal limit. With his shades,
Joe has become a bit more hep,
but heavy-duty frames are still
needed.

2. His nose — I really shouldn't
lower my journalistic ethics to
criticize the facial construction of
a sports personality. .

But I'm trying to write honest-

DAVE
ZAFRIS

ly. And I honestly would not
want to be within a 2-mile radius
when Joe sneezes. Then again,
some people consider a promi-
nentnose to be very attractive.

In some prehistoric cultures,

Joe's sizable nasal cavity would‘

be celebrated and admired — just
as it is in Happy Valley.
3. His brother — George Pater-

no is a wonderful color commen-

tator on Penn State games.
Especially if you enjoy the feel-
ing of hair rising on the back of
yourrneck.

In fact, after listening to George
for about 45 seconds, I find that
people get an olivecolored tint to
their complexions. It's really
quite attractive on people with

hazel eyes, but the effect is usual-
ly followed by prolonged
vomiting.

OK, I'll cut the snide remarks
about Paterno. I admit it was real-
ly amateurish. Let's rip on Penn
State in general.

The football team's uniforms
are dull. Dull seems to be the best
word to describe the white and
blue, uh, uniforms. I guess you
should call them uniforms.

They lack any semblance of an
insignia. They don't have the
names of the players, or the name
of the school, for that matter.
There are no stripes or patterns,
save the line that marks the mid-
dle of the helmet. But they do
have numbers on their helmets.

And Pitt fans, don't be devastat-
ed when you hear the masses in
Beaver Stadium chanting, ”We
are  Penn State!”

' Yeah, I admit it's loud and well— _

organized, but it's like screaming,

Why this writer hates the Nittany Lions

”The grass  is green.” It's gener-
ally accepted that the people in
the stands have something to do
with the university.

Finally, the Pitt Panthers have
a great chance to beat the No. 2
Nittany Lions.

Pitt's defense is traditionally
stubborn against the run, and
Penn State is a running team.
Shutdown D.J. Dozier, and you
cripple PSU’s offense.

Joe Felitsky proved last week
that he can pass the football, and
if he has only a fair game against
Penn State, Pitt's running game
can make the offense successful.

Pitt has nothing to lose, every-
thing to gain. Penn State has
everything to lose.

All the talk about PSU’s pro-
posed showdown with Miami in
the Fiesta Bowl for the National"
Championship might make. the
people in Happy Valley overlook
Pitt. Wouldn't that be a shame?

Wrestling team opens tonight at Waynesburg

By Rick Fellinger
Staff Writer

You're in for a match?

”Yeah,,you're in for a match,”
kidded Pitt wrestling coach
Rande Stottlemyer. I

He's not kidding that much
though, because he's very excit-
ed about the I986-87 Pitt Panther
wrestling squad- .

Pitt's season begins tonight

with a dual match against
Waynesburg. V

Stott|emyer’s wrestlers
shouldn't have much trouble
with Waynesburg. ”It’s a good

opener for us,” says Stottlemyer.

.”We should do well. We're go-

ing to be alright if we wrestle like
we're capable.” He sees Waynes-
burg as a good way to get rid of
what he calls the ”first match
blues.” -

Nationals at Old Dominion, Va.,
but they all wrestled as individu-
al athletes and did not represent
the university.

The reason for this is that the
NCAA allows each school 21
dates on their schedule.

However, wrestlers can com-
pete in as many matches as they
want if they pay their own way,
wear‘ their own uniform and don't

wrestle as _a team. Stottlemyer‘

calls a date like this an ”unoffi—
cial” match.

At the Eastern Nationals, Bolin
and Santoro each earned a first-
place finish. While at West Vir-
ginia, Gerhardwas undefeated at
3-0 before he withdrew from the
tournament when his shoulder
started to bother him. Three Pan-
thers still finished in the top four
of their respective weight classes:
Steve Kasza (|l8 pounds), Turner
and Tongel. . _

Kasza and Mike Sipos will be
wrestling individually as much as

‘possible this season since they

are ineligible because of aca-
demics.

Pitt is one of the charter mem-
bers of the Eastern Wrestling
League, which Stottlemyer said is
comparable in prestige and talent
to the Big East in basketball. The

E.W.L. is made up of national _

powerhouses like Penn State,
Clarion and Bloomsburg along
with formidable wrestling schools
like ‘West Virginia, Cleveland
State and Lock Haven. '
The Panther co-captains for the
’86—87 season -are seniors Bolin
and Wertz. Stottlemyer called Bo-
lin ”Mr. Slick.” ”He’l| technique
you to death,” said Stottlemyer.
”But he also knows how to» be
real physical too, so if you want
to get into a brawl with him,
you'll be in for a mismatch." Last
year Bolin was redshirted with an
injured shoulder, but this year
he's a good All-America candi-
date and could possibly even

compete for a national champi-
_ onship. ‘ ‘

Wertz, a native of Altoona, Pa.,
has earned a tremendous amount

of respect from Coach Stot-_

tlemyer. ’’I tip myhat to the kid,"
said Stottlemyer.‘. ”He’s a real
leader and a great example to the
younger kids.” Last year Wertz

placed fourth in the I67-pound in

weight class at the E.W.L. tourna-
ment, and he has the potential
this season to get an Eastern or
National ranking.

Another Panther who has a
good chance of becoming an All-
American this year is sophomore
Santoro, who will be defending
the A|l—America status that he
earned last year as a freshman.
He was also the team MVP and
was named freshman wrestler of
the year at I42 pounds by
Amateur Wrestling News. This
year, he has the ability to become
a national champion.

According to Stottlemyer, San-
toro is a ”jackhammer type with
great technique. He has relentless
pursuit, and he's a lot of fun to
watch.” Stottlemyer also said that
that Santoro is going to ”rock
some heads out there this
season.”

Other Pitt wrestlers who could
wind up with a National or
Eastern ranking are Gerhard, Ton-
gel and Rizzo.

Gerhard is in his first year at
Pittsburgh since transferring from
Penn State. He has three years of
eligibility left and should have an
immediate impact on the team.

The top freshmen recruits this
year are Brian Schaffer at I34
pounds and Bill Lewis at I67
pounds. Lewis is a tall, lanky kid
with a bit of an unorthodox style.
He was Pennsylvania's state
runner-up in the l58—pound
weight class at Peters Township

Sophomore All-American Pat Santoro is Pitt's best returning wrestler this season.

TICKET POLICY 1 986- I 987

A ticket and Pitt student I.D. will be required at the Fitzgerald Fieldhouse
to gain admittance to all home basketball games. 9

Tickets will be available beginning one week prior to each home game.
(See distribution schedule).

Each student must present his/her current valid Pitt I.D. in person to
receive a ticket. Only one ticket will be issued to each
student.   S    
Student tickets will be handled through the William Pitt Union Ticket
Office only. The day of the scheduled home games, the Ticket Office will
open three (3) hours prior to the game.

High School.

Schaffer, from Woodbridge,
Va., will benefit from working
with Santoro and Bolin, and he
should fit into the scheme of
things nicely at Pitt. At Wood-
bridge High School he was the
Virginia State Champion at I34
pounds

Stott|emyer’s training phil-
osophy for preparing for this sea-
son is based on the triangle.

The idea is to build up a good,
solid aerobic base through run-
ning and twice—a-day workouts,

then as the season progresses,
shorten the length of the work-
outs while increasing the intensi-
ty to reach the peak in the trian-
gle at the National tournament.

There is one thing -that is very
unique about Pitt's training regi-
mine and that is what Stottlemyer
calls ”active rest day.” Every
Wednesday over the course of
the season the kids sleep in, and
at practice they do nothing but
play football, soccer or murder-
ball, which is something like
dodgeball.

_ Because of this, Stottlemyer
said his squad gets m-ore accom-
plished in the other four days of
the week than they ever did
working out five days a week.

Stottlemyer said that head
coaches aren't supposed to make
predictions, but assistant coaches
are. So, assistant coach John Har-
tupee said that he expects Pitt to
finish in the Top 10 in the nation,
barring injuries.

Stottlemyer did say that things’

on the Panther mats are ”upbeat
and on the rise.” He's looking

forward to a good year and thinks -

that Pitt will have a legitimate
chance in every match. ”|njuries
could play a big part in our suc-
cess,” said Stottlemyer. ’’The fans
who come up to watch us are
definitely going to get their
money's worth.”

Big East Championships (New York City)

‘ must present coupon

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

Now it's time to say goodbye,
but oh, what a time it has been.

John Congemi, the starting
quarterback for the Panthers’
offensive squad for the past four
years, is ending his college foot-
ball career this Saturday at Penn
State. Unfortunately, he's leaving
as an injured player, but his past
speaks for itself and truly quali-
fies him as "one of the great
ones.”

Congemi, born June 19, 1964,

J came to Pitt in 1982 from Lauder-

dale Lakes, Fla., as a reserve pass-
er under Foge Fazio. After an
injury in his freshman year, he
started his first game against Tem-
ple in 1983. In this game, he led
his first Pitt victory with a score
of 35-0. Since then, there has
been no stopping him.
Congemj's record has been
rather impressive over these past
few years. In his sophomore year,
he made one of the most impres-
sive debut season standings ever
by a Pitt quarterback — with an
8-3-1 record and passing for
1,940 yards and 16 touchdowns.
This led the Panthers to a Fiesta

_ Bowl against Ohio State and an

MVP-offense award for Congemi.
His junior and senior years
were not as impressive due to a

 "" 
011 _ .

debilitating series of injuries, but
those years weren't as bad as

most predicted. As he battled his

own injuries, as well as a cons-
tant pounding from opposing
defenses, Congemi had to strug-
gle through these two seasons. If
anything, he came through them
with an acquired, quiet dignity —-
not easy for a star player.

This year, luck was shining
Pitt's way when Congemi was
given one more season of play-
ing time due to a retroactive med-
ical redshirt for his freshman year.
Pitt fans have been able to see
what separates him from the rest
because of it. '

Congemi is second in the rank- .

ings of Pitt all-time passing yard-
age with 6,467 (second to Dan
Marino). He is third in the total
offensive career-yardage leaders
with 6,350, and he holds first
place in top single-game passing

performance with 446 yards,-

achieved this year against Navy.
It is sometimes said that no-
body knows ‘a player as well as
his coach. Well, Mike Gottfried
has gotten to know John Conge-
mi very well, and he likes what
he has seen. _ '
"| don'tjust like him as a play-
er, I love him as a person,” said
Gottfried. "His injury this year
was a major loss to our team —

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November l9, T986

Track team set for Blue-Gold scrimmage

By Greg Sysyn
Staff Writer .

The Pitt men's track team is
coming off one of its most suc-
cessful seasons ever.

Last year the Panthers finished
fourth in the Big East conference
and fifth in the nation. And bet-
ter yet is the fact that the Panther
squad lost very few important
runners. With six returning All-
Americans (Lee McRae, Bob
Weiner, Tim Manes, Joe Daniels,
Dave Moore and Eric Cannon),
optimism for this upcoming sea-
son is running high. .

Obviously, McRae would
make anyone take notice of the
Panther track team, but this is not
a one-man team by any means.
”We are not a team of one
dimension," said Panther coach
John Vasvary. Certainly not. This
team also boasts returning Big
East champions Joel Ninos in the
steeplechase and Tim Kuligin the

javelin as well as ‘an All-America

two-mile relay team (Weiner,
Manes, Daniels and Moore). And
on top of that, a strong support-
ing cast is returning, waiting-to
burst onto the track scene.

This wealth of returning talent
combined with a strong recruit-
ing class would have many
coaches talking big-time champi-

-onships, but not Vasvary, who

likes to keep his team goals
simple.

‘ ”Our main team goal this year
is to be better than we were last
year,” said Vasvary. ”The season
is so long and injuries are so com-
mon in track that to set concrete
goals is tough. So, our whole
game is to improve as a team
throughout the year.”

On paper that looks as .if it
should be an easy task. Last year
the Panthers placed fifth in the
NCAA indoor meet with just sev-
en competitors. This year the
potential is there for the placing

of more Pitt performers at the _

NCAA indoor meet. Junior Calvin
Holmes, for example, failed to
qualify for the NCAA indoor

Meanwhile, sophomore defen-

meet but then turned around and
qualified for the NCAA outdoor
meet.

According to Vasvary, the Pan-
thers will be enjoying an added
plus because of an increase in
depth this year.

’’In the past, our lack of depth
has caused us to have to sacrifice
one part of the meet in order to
stengthen another,” said Vasvary. '
”For example, we would weaken
our mid-distance part in order to
strengthen our distance part. This
year, because of our depth, that
shouldn't happen. Also, in the
past, injuries hampered us more
than they should this year. We
have a lot of guys with the capa-
bility to step right in and
perform.’’,

Another added bonus to the
Panthers is the possible addition
of several football players who
have strong track-and-field back-
grounds.

Junior linebacker Zeke Gadson
was a sprinter with the team last
year and finished third in the Big ‘
East behind McRae and Cannon.

sive end Burt Grossman was a top
shot putter in high school, and
freshman wide -receiver Darrin
Gillaspie high jumped 7-1 in high
school.

These players would strength-
en a Panther weakness in the
field events, but as of now they
are still playing football, and the
decision to join the track team is
between them and football coach
Mike Gottfried. -

Within the Big East conference,
the Panthers’ main competition
will come from traditional power-
houses Villanova, Georgetown
and Seton Hall, who all have
strong track teams.

But Syracuse, St. John's’ and
Providence should not be over-
looked, either. They are more
one-dimensional_in nature, but
they have the capacity to over-
take a stronger track team be-
cause of a lack of competition in
their strengths.

Nationally, the Panthers face
almost. the same cast. Villanova
and Georgetown finished second
and third respectively last season,
while Seton Hall would have had

a strong showing, but late-season
injuries hampered the Pirates’ im-
pact on the NCAA meet.

The only major difference will
be the addition of Arkansas, who

was the ”best" team in America
last year, but the Razorbacks con-

sisted primarily of foreign
athletes. J

Meanwhile, the Lady Panthers
track squad is also coming off a
strong showing last year, having
finished fourth in the conference
indoor meet.

Pitt women's coach Steve
Lewis has goals very similar to
those of Vasvary. /'

”We finished fourth in the Big
East conference indoor meet and
third in the outdoor meet," said
Lewis. ”With eight returning
letter-winners, we are looking to
improve on those finishes and
improve as a team.”

Last year the Lady Panthers set
14 Pitt records, an outstanding
feat for such a young team.

Gloria Azeke, a sophomore
from Brooklyn, took part in set-
ting six of those records. Lori
Wood, a returning senior and

premed student, set two distance.
records for the Pitt women. Deb-
bie Bonner, a sophomore from
Philadelphia, also set two
records. These three should be
the team leaders this season.

Both the Pitt men's and wom-
en's track teams begin their sea-
sons with the traditional
Blue-Gold meet next Monday at
Fitzgerald Field House. Although
this is an intra-squad meet,
Holmes sees the underlying sig-
nificance of the meet.

”The Blue-Gold meet is a place
for us to establish a base for go-
ing into this season,” said
Holmes. ”We need to sharpen
ourselves up in preparation for
our first meet next weekend. It's
also a time for coaches to see
how runners can perform at new
events under meet conditions."

The Blue-Gold meet is free to-'
the public and starts at 7 p.m. on 
Monday. Because of the tremen- ,

dous talent of the Panther track
teams, this meet should be in-
teresting despite the lack of out-
side competition.

Lady Panthers ready for season

By Matt O'Hara

For The Pitt News

Tonight at 7:30 the Pitt Lady
Panther basketball ‘team kicks off
its 1986-87 season with an exhi-
bition game against Santa Domin-
go at the Fitzgerald Field House.

The regular.season begins Nov.
29 at home against American
University.

Although only in his second
season as Lady Panther head
coach, Kirk Bruce is anything but
new to Pitt basketball.

During the early to mid '70s,
Bruce won three varsity letters at
Pitt, and in his senior year he was
named team captain, most valu-
ableplayer and district Division
1 Player of the Year. -

He graduated in 1975 with a
bachelor's degree in health and
physical education. In the follow-

‘ ing season, he took the position

of graduate assistant to Panther
head coach Tim Grgurich. After
a brief absence, Bruce returned to
the University of Pittsburgh as as-
sistant coach of the Lady Panthers

' for the 1984-85 season. The fol-

lowing year he became head
coach. ’
Lady Panther basketball is a fa-

mily affair with the Bruces. Kirk's‘

younger sister Jennifer is" the all-
time leading scorer in the pro-
gram. She totaled 2,295 points
between 1981-84 and was
named captain for three seasons.

Meanwhile, their father Clar-
ence rarely, if ever, misses a
game and is one of the most vo-
cal supporters of the team —- a
team thatcould be a much im-
proved squad this season.

Last year, the Lady Panthers
had an overall record of 11-16
and were only 5-11 in the Big
East. Senior guards.Kim C-annis
and Kim Tirik averaged 14.7 and
12.9 points per game respective-

ly. Asrco-captains of last year's‘

tearh, both Tirik and Gannis
graduated among the top 10 all-
time leading Lady Panther
scorers‘.

With the disappointing record
of last season and the loss of Tirik
and Gannis, why is coach Kirk
Bruce so excited about the up-
coming season?

”We’re a better team. We're
mentally prepared better than we
were last year,” said Coach
Bruce.

One of the changes on this
year's team is-the addition of two
new assistant coaches. Last sea-
son's assistants, Wayne Williams
and Carol Dugan, both left to take‘

J on different jobs.

Kim Basick, formerly of Robert
Morris College, is one of Bruce's
new assistants. Bruce said that
Basick is a ”real go-getter.” He
believes that she has added a
great deal of enthusiasm to prac-
tice and will, in turn, have a great
impact on this year's team.

The second of the two assis-
tants is John LeMieux, an assistant
at Kent State last season. ”He’s

my ace recruiter,” said Bruce.
LeMieux works particularly with
the team's front-line players, most
notably 6-5 senior center Jenny
Tyner. Bruce also gets what he.
calls ”invaluable help” from se-
cond year, part-time assistant
Teresa Schutzman. She does
mostly administrative work,
along with scouting and on-
campus recruiting.

-With such an excellent staff,
Bruce is confident that the team
will be able to accomplish its
primary goal for the season,
which is to reverse last season's.
dismal record.

If Pitt can achieve that goal, it
could be among the top teams in
the conference. However, Bruce
says that Villanova is this year's
”team to beat” in the.Big East.
Other teams to watch include
Providence (last year's regular

"season champs) and Syracuse

(Big East tournament champs).
But after the disappointmentof
last season, Bruce wants to make
apoint this year. ”We want to
makea‘ statement to’ the league,’’
said Bruce. ”When you play Pitt,
you'd better be ready to play.’’
The main problem Bruce faces
on his team is replacing Tirik and
Gannis. He expects 5-5 junior
Valerie Halesworth, one of the tri-
captains on this year's team, to fill

the void at point guard. ’’I’m real-

ly looking for Val to run the
team,” said Bruce. She saw ac-
tion in 25 of the 27 games last
year, but this is an entirely new
role for her. ,

Jenny Shingler, a freshman

-from Altoona High School, has

already earned the job as starting
second guard.

Surprising? Maybe not. Last
season, Altoona was ranked No.
1 in the country. In addition to
being a first team all-state player,
Schingler also made Street &
Smith's honorable mention All-.
American. ' ~ .

Sophomore guard Shaunda
Byrd, a se|dom—used player last

year, will see more action this .

season. ”She will add unbeliev-
able quickness to the guard posi-
tion,” said Bruce. ”She will
definitely get playing time.”

4 Another playerwho will see
some time at second guard is
senior Jane Plake, also a tri-
captain. ”Although she primari-
ly plays as a forward, Jane is a‘
versatile player,” said Bruce. ”l’m

_ looking for her to double her
- scoring output from last year. I

think Jane will really assume the
job as a leader on and off the
counf’

The team's leading returning,

scorer and rebounder is junior
Sally Sheerer, the Lady Panthers’
third captain. Obviously, Bruce is
looking for a really big year out
of her as well. ‘ . - -

The last of the returning start-
ers is Tyner. ”Jenny is a clutch
player but sometimes a slow start-
er,” said Bruce.

Congemi  

almost as if you were to take
Tony Dorsett away from 1976's
team. But he'll bounce back, I

know he will. I expect him in the

pros soon.

’’In a coaching career, you are
lucky to have two, maybe three
truly golden and wonderful peo-

 ple who you can coach and

watch progress to their fullest;
Johnny is one of those people for

me. I love him, I respect him, and

I'll never forget him,” Gottfried
conﬁnued.

Neitherwill anyone else who
has gone to Pitt these past four
years. Perhaps, as Gottfried said,
Pitt has been -blessed to.have had

such a truly great athlete and per-
son as John Congemi. , ’

Off the bench, Bruce is count-
ing on seniors Patty Paul and Pam
Novosel and sophomore Tabatha
Long, who played in high school
with Byrd-. Long had _ her mo-
ments last year and should
definitely be a much better play-
er this season. Bruce agrees.

"’Tabatha is really coming into

her own. She definitely has the

athletic potential to get the job

done,” he said. _ - .
Unfortunately, the team will be

. without_ the services of sopho-
more guard Jill Sitlinger, as she is

in a ‘cast with a bad ankle. Ac-
cording‘ to Bruce, Sitlinger is a
"big loss” for the team.

From late November until ear-
ly March, the Lady Panthers face
a demanding schedule both in
theconference and outside of it.
The program has suffered only
two losing seasons in the past 12
years. There is no doubt in the

" mind of head coach Kirk Bruce

that this year's team will uphold

the program's winning tradition. '1 ‘
