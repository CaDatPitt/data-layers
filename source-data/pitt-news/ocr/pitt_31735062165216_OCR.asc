More Talks Planned
OnHospital Transfer

1-3

The city of Pittsburgh and_ this university will meet in
about two weeks to continue ironing out obstacles in the
transfer of the $2,000,000 Municipal Hospital to Pitt, it was
decided last Friday, March 12. ~

Concerning the meeting at that time between the city
and university ofﬁcials, Dr. Robert Moore, Vice Chancellor
of the Pitt Schools of the Health, stated, “In principle,

it appearsrthat we agree with the
City. There are still some matters,
however, that have to be staright-
ened out.”

He continued, “It’s a matter of
sitting down with the City and
seeing what’s acceptable to City
Council.” Before meeting with the
City again, the medical committee
of the Pitt board of trustees will
meet and examine terms of the
agreement.

Debt Refused

At last Friday’s meeting, Pitt
officials said the University can-
not assume the $322,000 debt on
the hospital and ‘asked that the
City be responsible for that
amount. .

Pitt’s proposal that the City‘ as-

cume a" maximum yearly obliga-~

tion of $120,000 a year to the

. hospital to cover losses after 1958

has been scaled down. It is un-
derstood the City has been asked
to provide up to $100,000 a year
for ﬁve years to cover losses. There
is some doubt that the City can
legally pay_,this subsidy.
I Pitt also. asked that the City
pay the university for the care
of communicable disease cases
sent by it to the hospital. As
part of the hospital operation,
the university will maintain 20
beds, and even more if neces-
sary, for care and treatment of
such diseases. The City will pay
for these patients, according to-
an 1895 state law, and then
collect what it can on its own.
Inasmuch as the hospital is to
be turned over to’Pitt- as a gift,
the City is reluctant to undertake
any ﬁnancial obligation. It was
indicated, however, that the
‘amount in question be open to
negotiation’.

This is the fourth of a series of
the Men’s Debate program in
which 35 high schools will be
visited “to give the participants

practice in the techniques of an-

alysis, organization,‘ and presenta-
tion "to off-campus groups.”,

In its ﬁrst three series the win

and loss count ' was Pitt—8,
Princeton—3; Pitt—6; Fordham—
4; and University of South Caro-
lina——2, Pitt—1.
. The affirmative side of the
question will be handled by Pitt
on Monday, Tuesday and Thurs-
day, and the negative, on Wed-
nesday. Ten public high schools
will be hosts to the teams during
the week.

would chip in with some money
to help pay for the care of those
who cannot afford needed hospi-
talltreatment, Mr. Jones said that
the City is not set up for anything
like that. For patients with non-
communicable ailmens, the City
will not pay anything. _

Under Pitt’s proposal, the uni-
versity will’ rename the facility
“University Hospital? when its
Graduate School of Public Health
moves into a new building now
under construction. The labora-
tories of Dr. Jonas Salk, director
of Virus Research Laboratory, now
located in Municipal, will not be
affected by the transfer of the
hospital, according ‘to Dr. Moore.

 

“God alone is just and right;
all men are only relatively so‘. To
discern the degree of relativity
andto chart anew the course of
humanity in ever broadening un-
derstanding, biography is the best
teacher.”

4 This was part of the speech of
Dr. Edwin Booth, convocation
speaker for Religion—in-Life week,
at the Pitcairn—Crabbe Foundation
meeting ‘Monday evening in Ste-
phen Foster Memorial.

Although a native of Pittsburgh,
Dr. Booth lives in Islington, Mass.
He holds a Ph.D. from Boston
University where he has been pro-
fessor of church history since 1925.

The convocation speaker has
written many biographies of re-
ligious ﬁgures, such as Martin
Luther. He has also written “Let-
ters To Live By,” and “The Great-
er Church.” ~

“Pitt has never had anything

a series of Easter hymns.

Mr. Lotz explained the origin
of ' the “Great Hymns of the
Church” he performs: ‘In Bach’s
time it was the custom of the
organist to improvise on the
chorale tunes. Bach wrotemany
chorale preludes as appropriate
pieces to mark the ecclesiastical
season..Almost half of ‘Bach’s or—.-
gan music is of this character.

“In some churches ‘in recent
years it has.become customary for

In teaching biography, schools
have one of the greatest areas for
discovering and examining the
true criteria under which good
and evil, and other relevant moral
choices can be established, the
writer proposed. * 1

“If peace and the develop-
ment of human persons is the
natural environment of man,
then these facts show quite
clearly the inescapable demand
for new standards of value in
our time,” he continued. —

The professor claimed that
“Here in our world we deal in

a universal pattern.

Two Things left  W .

-u—

' 7‘ ‘ The philosopher Emanuel Kant once wrote, “When all

. "things are gone, I will have two things left: the stars above

and consciousness in my‘ heart.”

.« g A How dependable are both these concepts and how per-
,fect’they are for one’s‘ peace of mind. The man who knows

 his will and who can visualize the magnitude of the Uni-

verse without conceiving himself instrumental inits making
indeed has much more than most people would hope for. It

i . is a rare person who possesses with assuredness the knowl-

 

edge‘ that he might be part and parcel of a great plan with '
the free .capacity to ﬁnd "his place in its machinations.

Our world is too hurried.—our days pass too quickly, the
hours tick off too rapidly, so we run. We run up University
walks and into class, and then we run up stairs to the library,
and we dash out _to a streetcar so that we can hurry home
to study. But how much of the world do we live in if we

must read in only the books about the sweeping ﬂight of the ~

3_ skylark or the New England countryside? Must we bury

ourselves in the books and debris that piles up around our
 desks to pursue an education? ‘

.»

We’re thrilled with the ﬁndings of a new element, or a

new ‘fossil that should piece together hundreds and thous-

int‘  "ands ,of years of physiological history. We’re so worried

about where we came from that we seldom/worry where
are we going. And, how can we know that when ‘we don’t
even have time to see the world in which we live? We don’t
look at the trees, the ﬂowers, the sky, the stars, the ground
our own gifted hands. We hurry. , ' A
, A program such as Religion-in-Life, if it does nothing
else, makes us stop to think about some of thesespiritual
and mystical -concepts that shape human thinking. For three

‘ days, we take a breather from the routine to delve into

 

 

  biblical concepts that are as true today as when they were
' ' inscribed. It is a refreshing pause, but sometimes all too . '

unique for the purpose to which the week is committed.
It stimulates conversation, because each year it is new;

I‘  yet, R-I-L should actually be a continuity of year-around

thinking about the world in which we live and how it can
be improved, although any “idealistic” notion is today con-

'sidered repugnant. R-1-L Week momentarily stops, our

hurrying so that we may think. ‘
_. - For that purpose, it is worthwhile. Yet, such a week
would be unnecessary if our year-around conversation re-

mained on the high level it assumes these three days.

The Student“ Government Dilemma 

The Important In

By Irv Rothman
»» ‘l Last of a Series)

There are too many student government organ-
izations working independently of each other. This
is the basic problem that exists for students at Pitt.
It will not be easy to solve..

The difficulty that one faces in attempting a
realistic solution is that of hide—bound tradition
and personal desires. Neither ;.
MC, WSGA, IF, Pan-Hel, nor the
E & M Cabinet will be willing
to give up the autonomy they
now have.

Any solution will center about
two all-encompassing groups at
the University—class officers and
Student Congress with Congress
thefulcrum of student gbvern-
ment. The very important con-
sideration in our discussion must be the individual

Aclassmate; only in reﬂecting any solution to his

needs can we honestly improve this wasteful situa-
tion. ’ ~

Class Officer Structure

Although thehadvent of dormitories and the stu-
dent union will enhance closer relationships among
students, the only body in school which has the
innate structureto develop intimate feeling is that
of the class officers. In any well-planned set-up,
each of the four or ﬁve officers of individual classes
should be responsible for creating the type of pro-
gramming that makes for intelligent and steady
friendships throughout one’s school career. \

This may include dances, dinners, athletic par-’
ticipation, or student-faculty discussions. Ofﬁcers
may encourage participation in orientation pro-
grams or support the purchase of class rings which

might need no encouragement once studentsde-.

velop a responsible feeling for their Schools and
University.

Only Choice , I _
‘Student Congress, the only possible choice for
overall government, on the other hand, would spon_
sor “all dances, festivals, orientation or IM sports
programs that are open to- the whole school. It

In the revised SC, each school would also elect: V

in proportion to the number of students registered} 
in the individual schools. That way all schools (1—)._;

A semester of luncheon dating
ended in the form of rushing
parties last weekend, and sorority
women have settled down for a

Fraternity men no longer

gining at one side of a booth,

ending with standing room only

longer have to stalk their prey
in the halls, or call up the un-
known freshmen to make lun-
cheon dates.

Fine Art of Luncheons

They can put away their ﬁne
art of luncheon dating, which
consists of saying on the phone,
“Hello, Suzy, I’m a Signa Phi
Nothing, and I’d like to make a
luncheon date with you.” Suzy
says, “Just a minute until I get
my Polaris.” "Then after going
through the ritual of, “What
hours do you ‘have free?” and,

“Do you know the booth is?” A

a meeting place is set, prefer-
ably the “White Tuck” or .“un-
der the clock.”

Later, when sorority girl and
rushee meet, and "sometimes
they never do, they don’t look
at all like what they had sound-
ed ' like during the telephone
conversation. This adds a handi-
cap to the sport as the two stand

When and if the two arrive

man plays a fast game of “Up-

balancing the tray in one hand,

Sometimes, though not often
during this game, sorority -wo-'

woman doesn’t. mind. She just

The ﬁrst type is the most
dangerous because it is difficult
to search him out and then get
through to him. He is almost
impervious to new ideas; he’d

out of his lust for student posi-

Pennsylvania Joins Intergration Battle . . .

Defending the Federal Constitution

By Leonard Kirsch

At this time, there are important battles being
fought for racial equality in both Alabama and
Pennsylvanja. ‘

In Tuscaloosa, the unjustiﬁed expulsion of Miss

Autherine Lucy, the ﬁrst Negro student to at-
tend the University of Alabama, has in no way
ended the ﬁght to permit Negroes to attend that
state school. After being forced
off Campus by mob violence
Miss Lucy was expelled because
she. planned to_ bring certain
charges against some University
oﬁicials.
I In Montgomeryythe boycott
of Jim Crow busses is still going_
strong. It is effective in the face .
of 100 indictments that have
been drawn out against the lead-
ers of the Negrocommunity.

 

Pennsylvania Congressrnen Act

But the ﬁght for civil rights is by- no means
limited_to Alabama. At. the present time, there
is the important Monroe Resolution‘ awaiting vote
in the State House of Representatives. 4

Most simply, the Resolution informs the Con-
gress of the United States and the Attorney Gen-
eral, that the people ‘of the State of Pennsylvania,
and its legislature, want to see the Constitution
enforced throughout the nation.‘

The Resolution is aimed directly at Mississippi.
It grew out of ‘the “barbarous and unpunished
murder of the Negro child, Emmett Till...”

One From Many Countries

Engineer Has Early World Travels

Juan O’CallaI1an Is

American-Englislr

_ Irish-French Etc.

By ELVIRA TERNEY

Some universities h a V e
many students from various
countries; Pitt has one student
from many countries.

Juan O’Callahan, Engr. ’56,
is of American—Irish-English-
French — South. African - Aus-
trian-Italian background. '

His contact. with most of these
countries occurred before Juan
was of high school age.

Juan’s father was an American-
Irish painter living. in Paris when
he met Juan’s mother ,of English
background. Juan’s mother was
studying nursing at an American
hospital in Paris. .

The family’s diverse traveling
was due to J uan’s father having to
“obtain experience and knowledge
of the subjects and objects he
painted.”

Travels Started Near Spain
, O’Callahan (Jr.) was born in
Majorca, a smallisland near the
coast of Spain. It was here his
travelling career began. At nearly
a year old, Juan and his family
moved back to Paris for six years.‘

Juan’s residence in South

Africa began when his mother
received a private nursing offer
to take charge of a diabetic pa-
tient in ‘Durban, SouthvAfrica.

Juan’s father died soon after;

‘and mother and son, were pre-

vented from leaving South Africa
by events of the Second World

‘War-.

Later, Juan attended the private
boarding school of St. Aiden’s,
combination high school and pre-
paratory school. This school is lo-
cated about a thousand miles from
C}raham’s Town, South_Africa. The

-future engineer decided to study

 Offers Wednesday‘ Series
01’ Ten Films On Modern Art

WQED will telecast the ﬁrst
showing of the recently completed
series “Looking At Modern Art”
on Wednesday, March‘ 14 at 9
p.m. This will be the ﬁrst of ten
half-hour .films on the back-
ground of Twentieth Century art.

Composed and narrated by
Gordon Washburn, Carnegie In-
stitute’s director of Fine Arts, and
by Robert Snyder,
whose movie “The Titan,” won a
Hollywood Oscar in 1950, the
kinescoping of these programs
has been going 01‘! since October,
1955. '

Money for the project was’pro-
vided by the Ford Fund for Adult
Education. One hundred odd
paintings, borrowed from mu-
collections
throughout the ‘United States,
slides, reproductions, and .various
props have been used.to point up
the visual angle. Many of the
choicest pieces were lent by Car-
negie Institute. . .

The research staff at the Henry
Clay_ Frick Fine Arts Library pf
the University of Pittsburgh gave
their assistance to the team, as
did the engineering ‘department
at Carnegie Institute of Techno-
logy, the. visual and ﬁlm depart-
ment of the, Pittsburgh Board of
Puldic Education, and the‘ United

States Steel Corporation.

The purpose of thisprogram is
to help every viewer open his
eyes intelligently in understand-
ing contemporary art. ,

In this series, the major schools
of modern art are taken up,

showing‘ the early development of

each moveme_nt,,coupled with the
original works done by" the lead-
er in that particular ﬁeld. Em-
phases in_ line, form, and com-
position,‘ will be produced. Prac-
tically every, modern artist of im-
portance is. represented in the
series, including master works by
Picasso, Klee, Miro, Rounalt, Leg-

er,‘ Matisse, and Biacometti. ~-
Every program develops a dif-
ferent aspect of the movement.
One program on Leger shows the
machine and ‘technological in-
fluences. The"mor_al conscience of

man is dealt with in a study of
Ronault and his “Miserere et
Guerre” series. Two programs on
surrealism bring psychologicalVin-
fluences into focus with special

attention to the paintings of Pi-’

casso, Klee, and Miro. Both an-
alytic and synthetic cubism are
studied chronologiaclly, from the
early development to more de-
veloped stages. /

Cheating Not to End-
Under Honor Plan ,

By SHELLY WEISS
According to Student Congress President Bob Sedler,
Col. ’56, the primary purpose of the_honor system which he
co—authored is “to reduce tension during exams and not to

eliminate cheating.”

Recognizing ﬂaws in the system proposed at their Mon-
day meeting, SC is recommending an honor system for con-
sideration by the Student Faculty Relations Committee. The

committee report announced that’

“faculty members are in agree-
ment with the system, but not
the plan” as proposed by Con-
gress. ‘
Joe Montuoro, Col. ’56, co-author
of the bill and president of the
Council of Scholastic Organiza-
tions, stated that the system is in
keeping with the expansion of Pitt
and, its recent recognition for Dr.
Salk, sports. and the expanded

I campus.’ .

The proposed idea for an hon-
or system was taken from the
plan of William and Mary Col-
lege, approximately one third
the size of Pitt. Montuoro an-
nounced that no other schools
of equal enrollment have been
contacted but that Pitt needs a
“tailor-made system.”

Don Gartner, Col. ’56, stated
that the type of student is an im-
portant element to consider for at

Pitt many students put too much

emphasis on grades rather Ima‘ri‘*'-'-

on knowledge. This, he explained,
is encouraged by the high QPA,
requirements necessary for ac-
ceptance in graduate school.

It was a general consensus of "
the group that few students will
_“tattle-tale” _on cheating class-
mates because of the “personal
consequences” involved. Proc-
toring, however, will not be per-
mitted. The group agreed that
students can’t be coerced to sign

an honesty statement, but those ’

snot signing will be considered, 

as cheating.

The system has application to '
numbered 100. or ,

“all courses

men (English and gym), courses

in military or air science, and~~angz___

    Sports Writer

‘C While everyone’s _been concerned with the rising status of Pitt’s
football team—which has at last become real big league—-—and more
recently ‘the steady improvement of the basketball team (which just

‘racked up the best record of a-Pitt ﬁve in the last 10 years). Coach
'Rex'Peery’s wrestlers have been literally mauling some of the coun-
,try’s top wrestling squads and are now preparing to travel to the

Lehigh campus in defense of the Eastern championships which they

‘have held for two years.

Within the last seven years,

the mat game at Pitt has risen

from an unknown to being recognized as tHe third top power in

j the country through a national poll of wrestling coaches.
Much of the success of this rise has to be sent Peery’s_ way.
Peery was brought here by Athletic Director Captain Tom Hamilton
a to revive a sport that was defunct for 15 years. '
After starting out in 1950 with little material to work with,
Peery posted a 0-1 record. The very next year the Panthers
bounced ‘back with a respectable 7-7 record. From there on the
~ Panthers caught ﬁre and Peery produced‘ a team that took the
- Eastern Inter-collegiate Wrestling Association championship the
‘ very ﬁrst year they entered it. In doing so, Peery brought to-'

gether a team that began challenging. Penn State’s "supremacy

 

 

 

 

‘ up and again the following year when the Panthers claimed third

' in the East.

Up until 1954,‘the Nittany Lions won every athletic event in

sight from Pitt. Then in 1954 the'Panther‘ grapplers toppled their
’Keyst0ne rivals from their mythical‘ throne. ' C

The rivalry proved to be even keener as 500 fans turned out
last Saturday night at University Park to watch the Lions lose
thier most recent bid to regain the top prestige spot of the East
as they bowed to the‘Peery powerhouse 1-12. '

- In this preview of the Easterns, the Panthers showed enough

strength to convince most followers that they should be able to
swing through the EIWA for their third straight -championsmp

 ~ in as many years since they’ve entered the -Eastern’s.

Peery will ‘have two ‘returning EIWA champs in Bill Hulings,
123-pounds, and Ed Peery, 130—pounds, as well as one runner up in
' Ed DeWitt at 17-pourids to give the Panthers an edge in protecting

their crown.

Being optimistic and looking beyond the Easterners to the NCAA
championships to be held March 23-24 in Stillwater, Oklahoma
,, A (Peery’s hometown, incidentally) more than a few wrestling experts

 . ﬁgure the Panthers may come off with the top spot. _ p

‘Of Varsity Play

By AL ABRAMS

The 1956 Pitt Baseball team
has started its spring training
at the stadium with light
workouts and batting and
ﬁelding practice. ’
The team which won nine
and lost eleven last season is
coached by Bobby Lewis and the
Coach appears enthusiastic about
this year’s team; He feels that the
squad will be much better than
last year’s due to the fact, that his
pitchers now have that inuch
needed one year experience b‘e-.-
hind_them. “

That fact, coupled with the fact
that he has nine returning veter-
ans, four men up from the fresh-
man, and four football players who
want to try their skill at another
sport, gives him a very optimistic
point of view. "A

“The number of men who have compiled an average of

reﬁects the success of all sportsat the University this year,
Athletic director, T. J. Hamilton stated, in effect, last week.

In an open letter to Faculty members, the director Wrote a

than the number who Went on probation for scholastic de-

enth consecutive semester.

Americans

Get Grants

For Study

In 1954-55, 892 American
students received grants from
the U.S. Government for for-
eign study, and 1,633 foreign
students received some type
of ﬁnancial aid from the same

source, the Institute of Inter-
national Education » announced
last week. ‘

In the selection of students,‘

geography plays an important
role, officials stated. The Senate

,Appropriations committee in 1954

reported ,U.S. the policy, “‘The
selection of American exchanges
topgo abroad and the assignment

A of foreign exchangees should be

spread over the greatest geo-

Xgraphic area possible.”

Review of existing distribution

’ ofstudents showed that award re-
_ cipients are presently spread over

a wide geographic area.

in 1954-55, 892 successful
American students included res-

, idents of the 48 states, the Dis-

trict of Columbia, Hawaii and
Puerto Rico, whi) had studied ..t
262 U.S. institutions. The 1,633
students from 51 countries who
received some type of ﬁnancial
aid from the U.S. attended 370

‘ institutiones of higher education
in 44 states and the District of
Columbia.

The fact that many students are
unable to speak a foreign lan-
guage is the most limiting factor
in overseas grants. Limiting fac-
tors, in the placement of foreign
students, include the availibility

. of scholarship aid, the facilities
.for graduate study, plus .-the de-

sires of the foreign students for
placement. V

However, the type and amount
of ﬁnancial assistance "from the
U.S. Government limit "the free-
of geographically-oriented
assignments to American schools.

Of 1,633 foreign. students in
1954-55, only 6-03, or 37 percent,
received full Government support
and could, to some extent, be
placed according to geographic
considerations.

front in classrooms and to give
them a general idea about what

presented the administration v.iew-

the faculty aspect; and Irv Roth-
man, editor of the Pitt News pre-
sented the student viewpoint.

- Hooker Expresses Thanks

Hooker expressed gratitude to
the speakers for‘ their’ coming to"
the Religious emphasis program.
Both secular 'and' religious educa-
tion are important facets of the
daily life of the average student,
he stated, in effect.

Mayer assured speakers that
they would be prepared with
thought provoking questions

’ from people who were “as ma-
ture as_ college students any-
where.”

He recognized speakers’ disad-
vantage of being unfamiliar with
-the students with whom they
spoke. ,

But he listed the three points of
advice as basic to any class dis-
cussion. ’

I Students‘ Have Conﬂict

The Pitt News editor outlined
the problem that faces most col-
legiates.when he stated, “the fast
educational pace and the wealth
of ideas which students must de-
vour here so far surpass any
knowledge ’they might have about
religious-concepts that there is a
conflict.”

Rothman urged the speakers
to recommend [source material
to students so that they cpuld

supported with supplementary
information rather than merely
repeat discussions of the past.

After the initial ‘presentations,
speakers asked questions of the‘

‘LEADERSHIP NOW, AND romonnow

‘ If your objective is to put your best into engineering, and get the

most from engineering, you belong with an organization like
Curtiss-Wright where engineering is the focal point of all ac-
tivities. - , ' .
Curtiss-Wright offers stability, born of its world leadership in
aviation, and of its diversiﬁc'ation- today in the other major ﬁelds
of engineering.’ Curtiss-Wright’s program for the future is one of

action . . . action in which you, as an engineer, can make the most» _
’ of your abilities.

The scope of Curtiss-Wright’s research and ‘development pro- «
. gram permits you to choose your spot in most cases—aircraft

powerplants, fuel development and research, instrumentation,
propeller design, or one of a score of electronics projects. If you
are a mechanical, electrical, aeronautical engineer-or if you have
specialized interests—it will pay you to discuss your objectives
with the Curtiss-Wright interviewer when he comes to your
campus. ’ '

Curtiss-Wright is ﬁrst and foremost an engineering organiza-
tion. Its leadership in aviation is solidly founded in engineering

superiority. In commercial aviation as in military, applications,‘

Curtiss-Wright powerplants, propellers, and ﬂight simulation
equipment are the most advanced developments of their kind.
And research goes on. At Curtiss-Wright engineers explore still

- more power and‘ greater eﬂiciency for aircraft engines of every

kind . . . furtherdevelopments insubsonic, transonic and super-
sonic propellers . . . greater reﬁnements yet in‘ electronic ﬂight
simulation. _

And through its ever-expanding divisional activity, Curtiss-
Wright is pacing today’s progress  ﬁelds far removed from avia-
tion . . —. nucleonics, ultrasonics, plastics, metallurgy. Some 2200'
‘engineers are at work in Curtiss-Wright’s 15 divisions . . . and
in Quehanna, Pennsylvania—a new 85-square-mile Research and
Development Center offering ultra-modern resourcesand facili-
ties. for advanced experimentation, testing and development in
every branch of engineering. . -

This work is building ‘Curtiss-Wright's leadership tomorrow.
It is work for engineers who want a real future, oﬂering oppor-
tunity every bit as big as their desire to excel.
