Pitt announces new dean for School of Engineering

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh an--
nounced yesterday the appointment of
Charles A. Sorber as the new clean of
the School of Engineering.

"Sorber is the Associate Dean for
Academic Affairs in the College of
Engineering at the University of Texas
at Austin. Sorber will be succeeding the
current acting dean, Y. T. Shah.

In accepting the appointment, Dean
Sorber said that Pitt has a history of
being a great institution.“I look foward
to the opportunities and challenges of
developing Pitt into a national com-
petitor in engineering,” said Sorber.

One of his primary goals is to

develop and expand the graduate
education and research program while
at the same time maintaining a strong
undergraduate program.

“There are three important factors
which result in excellence in engineer-
ing education,” said Sorber. “They are
outstanding faculty, outstanding
facilities and equipment -- which are
critical to any engineering program —
and most importantly, highly motivated
students. The base for excellence in
engineering education exists at Pitt.”

Sam Deep of the provost’s office was
in charge of the committee to ﬁnd a list
of three candidates for the position of

Convocation honors
academic excellence

By William Young
Staff Writer

Wednesday marked this year’s an-
nual meeting of Pitt’s Honors Con-
vocation.

The ceremony is held to honor jun-
iors and seniors in high school who are
in the top two percent of their class and
Pitt graduate students who have ex-

‘ hibited superior performance in their
fields of academic endeavor. Students,

however, are not the only people hon-

ored; 130 faculty members from all
departments were also conferred
honors.

According to Pitt President Wesley
Posvar, the Honors Convocation is
used to “celebrate the central purpose
of the university, which is the pursuit
of excellence and scholarship.”

Being honored in the ceremony is no
easy task to accomplish: It requires
diligent work on part of the honoree,

work that gets noticed by one’s peers _

and educators.

“To be noticed for your intellectual
achievement requires aptitude. to be
sure,” Provost Roger Benjamin said.
“but it also requires dedication, com-
mitment and the joy of doing hard
work.”

The highlight of the ceremony came
with the conferring of an honorary doc-
torate in science upon Arno Penzias,

the vice president of research at AT&T
and Bell Laboratories‘. Penzias spoke
on getting a well-rounded education on
a campus of the future -— which would

revolve around the use of computers

and similar technology.
Penzias stated that people must never

forget that college is'a ‘ ‘community of

human beings, where ideas can be ex-
changed, created, modeled, modified,
discarded, ignored and, yes, even
picked up again.”

He went on to say that “college is
not a system of barracks with a highly
procrustean bed that puts everyone in
their proper place. I am pleased with
the diversity that ﬂourishes on a cam-

pus.”

The one quality that a human being I

must never lose, Penzias contended, is
the ability to estimate.

“A person must never lose his ability
to estimate,” Penzias said. “Humans
depend on it to remain people. People
have always estimated, and we can’t
become too dependent on exact facts
or we lose that uncertainty in our life.”

The campus of the future, one sat-
urated with computers and high tech-
nology. is nothing to fear.

“It was once thought that the pri-
mary unit of the future would be a com-
puter," Penzias said. “I think, how-

. ever. that the primary unit will be the
computer-assisted human being. ”

dean. The committee consisted of 12
people: six faculty members, one
graduate and one undergraduate student
from the school of engineering, three
people from outside the university and
David Hercules, the chairman.

“We originally had seven candidates
come to Pitt for interviews,” said
Deep. “After the interviews the com-
mittee had a marathon meeting, after
which we gave to the president and pro-
vost a list of three names. We gave
them a list of [the] strengths and
weaknesses of the candidates, and from
there it was up to them to collect any
extra data. ’

“We are very happy with their deci-

sion,” said Deep. “Sorber is the kind
of person who won’t be afraid to make
changes. He has the willingness to do
things, and he will provide motivation
for the faculty to be more involved in
the changes which will be made.”

Pitt President Wesley Posvar said
that he is grateful to previous deans_
Max Williams and Y.T. Shah in
building up the strength of the School
of Engineering, and he feels that under
Sorber the school will continue to
grow.

“We are most pleased to have some-
one with the leadership abilities and ex-
perience in academic administration
that Dean Sorber has. The ﬁeld of

Pitt prepares for Hand-in-Hand Festival

By Mike Churchill

 ‘For The Pitt News

The eighth annual Pitt Hand-in-Hand
Festival will be held in Forbes Quad
on Sat., March.22 and promises to be
a special day for the 400 handicapped
children expected to participate.

Stage shows, clowns, games and, of
course. lots of food will be included in
the day-long event.

The distinctive feature of the festival
is that each child will be accompanied
by a Pitt student, called a “one-on-

. one,” who is specially trained for the

purpose. If past years are any indica-
tion, the students will get as much out
of the experience as the exceptional
children they are paired with.
“You’re brightening their day,” said

nursing major Amy Dukovcic.
“They’ve got to have fun, too. We can
pick up and go to a movie or a bar, and
they can’t do that. It makes me feel glad
that I have the mind and body to be
where I am.”

Last year, Amy was paired with a
1'4-year-old boy with multiple scler-
osis. “It makes you think,” she said.
“You’re sitting at your desk pulling
your hair out, and they can’t even go
to college.”

The event will involve more than
1,000 student volunteers. Head coor-
dinators Lori Mikelatis and Gloria Ran-
dall, along with 23 senior staff
members, have been preparing for next
Saturday’s festival since the day of last
year’s‘ event.

. “I’ve gotten a lot of satisfaction out
of doing this in years before,”

.4-.

said_

Mikelatis, “and everyone enjoys it.
Last year was very successful. We had
plenty of donations and prizes, and
there were no emergencies.”

Every one-on-one volunteer attends
a two-hour training session where each
is taught how to care for the child.
They are instructed in what to do in
case of a seizure or other emergency,
how to feed the child and other
essentials.

Andrea Burnette, accompanied by
her mother Carol, attended a recent
Hand-in-Hand Festival. “She had a
lovely time,” said Mrs. Burnette.
“Andrea doesn’t verbalize a lot, but
she radiates when she has a good time,
and it was obvious that she enjoyed it
very much.”

“Weekends and summers become

very long for handicapped children,” .

continued Mrs. Burnette, “because
there are few things to participate in.
That’s very difﬁcult for the child as
well as the parent.”

The Hand-in-Hand Festival receives
extensive support from the university.
Fifteen local corporations have made
contributions to the Hand-in-Hand
organization, and Mayor Caliguiri an-
nually proclaims the festival date as
“Hand—in-Hand Day in the City of
Pittsburgh.” The honorary chairmen of
last year’s event were Steelers Keith
Willis and Tunch Ilkin. Franco Harris
attended the year before. In 1982, the
KDKA Rainbow Machine broadcasted
live from the festival site.

Pitt student Ken Lyle was a one-on-
one volunteer in last year’s festival.

engineering is of utmost importance to
the economic well-being of our coun-
try and is critical to the transformation
of the Pittsburgh area from an in-
dustrial to a technology and informa-
tion community,” said Posvar.

Pitt Provost Roger Benjamin said
that Sorber’s appointment will assist in
recruiting more top scientists to Pitt.

“Sorber has an outstanding record as I

a scientist, , educator and ad-
ministrator,” said Benjamin.

Sorber has conducted research and
published extensively in the areas of
land application and water disinfection.

Dean Sorber will assume his new
position as acting clean on July 1, 1986.

SGB budget

axe begins
to fall

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer 0

Organizers of Pitt’s annual Hand-in-
Hand festival for handicapped children
argued against proposed cuts in their
budget last night before the Student
Government Board. .

The SGB faces a budget shortage of
more than $230,000 in fulﬁlling stu-
dent activity demands in this ﬁscal year
1987. As a result, the many student
groups and organizations who have
received university ﬁnancial support in
the past will have a much more difﬁcult
time when their requests come before
the SGB.

The cuts proposed by the allocations
committee for the Hand-in-Hand
festival included requests for three
walkie-talkies to be used by medical
personnel at the festival.

“We feel it is the responsibility of
the medical personnel, and not the
SGB, to provide walkie-talkies, " sug-
gested Pam Underwood, allocations
chairman.

The board agreed with the commit-

« tee on the walkie-talkies, as well as

with a recommendation that the amount
of decorations used be decreased. The
committee’s proposed budget for
Hand-in-Hand showed a discrepancy
between the amount of ﬁlm they were
allowed to purchase and the amount of
ﬁlm they were allowed to develop.
SGB voted to rectify the discrepancy.

As part of the funding allocation
process, the SGB votes on the recom-
mendations of the allocations commit-
tee. The SGB session in which the ﬁnal
allocations are made presents the

organizations seeking funds with an op-.

portunity to appeal the recommenda-
tions of the allocations committee.

The student Science Fiction and Fan-
tasy Association also disputed cuts in
its budget, speciﬁcally a request for
$6,000 to bring Isaac Asimov to Pitt
to lecture. The SGB again upheld the
allocations committee’s recommenda-
tion and voted against the request.

The SGB will continue voting on
allocation recommendations throughout
the week. Together, the allocations
committee and SGB will have to
resolve the problems caused by the
funding shortage with similar actions
in the coming months.

U—CEP assists disadvantaged

By Stephanie Frelick
Staff Writer

The University Committee for Edu-
cational Programs has been dedicated
to the academic and personal develop-
ment of some 3,800 students since its
founding in 1968.

Originally known as Project A, then
Tri-M and now U—CEP, the program
has a genuine interest in helping less
advantaged students adjust to college-
level academics.

The program, which is a part of
CAS, has three separate phases. It

identiﬁes and recruits students that are '

having trouble in regular college
courses, provides courses for those
students and serves as a counseling
center.

According to Joel Reed, director of
U—CEP. the committee evolved as a
result of “community leaders and
students coming together.”

It was recognized that special atten-
tion should be given to kids, not
necessarily who had trouble in high
school, but rather who found the tran-
sition into college a little more
demanding.

“Our purpose is to identify and
recruit less advantaged students at
Pitt,” said Reed. “Students who are
not underachievers, but who have dif-
ﬁculty in regulating into the cur-

’ riculum. ”

Since 1969, U—CEP has been respon-
sible for admitting thousands of
students into the program. And of the
thousands, one third have obtained
degrees from the university. Current-
ly there are 648 active students in the
program ranging from freshman to
seniors.

Available for credits in U—CEP are
courses such as algebra, which fulﬁlls
the CAS basic skills requirement;
physical science, which satisﬁes the
general education requirement; and a
learning skills program. English
writing was offered until three years
ago but is now the responsibility of the
English Department.

Even with the attention given to such
fundamentally important academic
skills, U—CEP does not ignore the
students’ needs for personal guidance.
“In addition to offering academic
courses," said Reed, “we have exten-
sive counseling and tutoring for
students.”

While many schools provide pro-
grams comparable to U—CEP, Reed
feels that Pitt is unique in the sense that
it began back in 1968, when few such
programs had been developed. Today,
Pitt is a member of an organization
called Urban-13 Institution.

Originating in the 1970s, the group
is actually comprised in 14 schools

up with the people you can best deal‘
with," said Lyle. “I had a four-year-
old with spinabifida, and I was talking
to him like I’d talk to anyone. It makes
you see that your problems are small
in comparison."

_ Faculty advisor Sharon Godert also
greatly enjoys her role in Hand—in—
Hand Festival. “Personally, as an ad-
visor, it’s very fulfilling to watch
students give so unselﬁshly of their
time and energy. Just to see the smiles
on the kids’ faces is very satisfying. I
would encourage anybody to come and

see what a heartwarming thing it is.
Unless you‘re actively at the event, it’s
hard to describe it_.

“They’ve done a lot for community
awareness," continued Godert. “It
puts the students in a good light as far
as the community is concerned. It
makes you feel proud to be associated
with the University of Pittsburgh."

which include: Pitt, Temple, Wiscon-
sin University and the University of
Cincinnati.

According to Reed, as far as reten-
tion in graduation ﬁgures, Pitt is in the
top 10 percent of Urban 13.

A feature newly created by U—CEP
is its Annual U—CEP Awards program.
In its second year, the program gives
cash awards which are sponsored by
the Provost ofﬁce from the Com-
monwealth Fund — funding given to
state-related schools.

This year’s awards service took place
this past Wednesday. Eighteen students
were recognized for their fall term
achievements. To be considered for
this award, the students had to have
ﬁrst-term QPAs of 2.75 and submit
self-evaluations, and recommendations
from an instructor and counselor. This
year the top award recipient is Robert
Williams, the second category recipient
is Travaire Williams and the third
category award recipient is Tracy
Shakespeare.

As director of the program, Reed
believes that U—CEP’s purpose is be-
ing fulﬁlled and would like the em-
phasis on academics to be preserved.
“We hope these awards provide incen-
tive for students, showing them that
academic excellence is what it’s all
about,” said Reed. “And, therefore,
that’s.what they should be about.”

The Trap  
of Student Loans

. The ever-rising cost of higher education has
assured the allure of Guaranteed Government Stu-
dent Loans. For many prospective students and
their families who are feeling the pinch of these
hard financial times, a college diploma would be
but a pipe dream were it not for agencies like
PHEAA. But too often, students are victimized
by their immediate pecuniary needs and neglect
to consider the long—term implications of
education-on—credit.

Student loans are enticing precisely because
they offer the illusion of “easy money” to wide-
eyed, ﬁnancially desperate students. They give
students the means to meet burgeoning tuition
rates without the urgency of making immediate
monthly payments. But the burden of these loans
exacts an odious cost after graduation.

The debt incurred after four years in college
can be up to $10,000. A legal obligation for a very
large sum of money has thus been established even
before the student has embarked on a career. In
essence, the borrower has sold his soul to the com-
pany store and, like it or not, is forced into the
role of “productive citizen.”

Student loans are an effective and deceptive
lure, ushering our unsuspecting youth into a ready
acceptance of the complacent bourgeois worka-
day world. The imminent, portentous threats of

a jail sentence and a bad credit rating help to herd .

matriculating students into the clamoring ranks
of the middle class. In a way, then, student loans
are yet another device by which are propagated
new generations of soulless bankers, managers
and engineers, keeping the lower echelons of
America’s executive/bureaucratic wasteland
well-manned.

PIP Class Dropped

I am extremely disappointed that
Pitt’s Informal Program has dropped
the Positively Singular classes and
seminars from its program. PIP is part
of the College of General Studies. I
have been informed that PIP has
dropped Positively Singular beginning
this spring even though there is a large
waiting list of people signed up to take
the course(s).

I am a student in the Winter Term
’86 Positively Singular Seminar. This
is the most meaningful personal
development course I have ever taken
at PIP or elsewhere. I value this course
much more highly than the professional
development courses which teach you
(theoretically) how to make more
money by playing games better than the
other people.

Please do not interpret this course as
a “fun” class. It is not a meeting place
to date and have sex; it is a forum for
single adults to discuss the problems
faced in single living, including the
problems created by social game-
playing. Married people must deal with
many of the problems we discuss, too.
Incidentally, about half the adults living
in the Pittsburgh area are single.

I have asked PIP to reconsider its
decision to drop Positively Singular
from PIP. I hope the university and
CGS will help them reconsider their
decision.

Debating Rights

The rhetoric used by Julie Hunt
referring to women’s right to safe birth
control (The Pitt News, March 5)
makes some assumptions which I beg
to debate.

Ms. Hunt first lumps safe birth con-
trol together with right to abortion. ‘I
am compelled to assert that birth con-
trol does not need to include abortion
in order for it to be safe. A variety of
birth control devices are available to
women and their partners that will pre-
vent pregnancy if they are used as
directed. Why use abortion as a means
of birth control when the decision to
be safe can be made earlier, before
another life is involved?

Secondly, women’s own responsible
planning, self-control and decision-
making ability has a much greater ef-
fect on their reproductive processes and
career choices than constitutional law
ever will. Today more than ever they
have many options open to them
without the availability of abortion.
What happened to the freedom women
gained with the Pill? To use rhetoric
that assumes that women’s ability to
control their lives actually can be dic-
tated by the Supreme Court insults.
women by implying that they cannot
exercise the precautionary judgement
necessary to prevent pregnancy, and
they simply cannot help themselves to
get what they need or to avoid what
they don’t.

Human
Action Society

I am a member of the White Action
Society. This means I can wear buttons
that say “I love being white” and join
an all-white sorority without anyone
claiming racial prejudice. Correct?
Well, this sentence is in no way
something I would want to do, but I
hope it caught a few people’s attention.
I have grown up a person that is offend-
ed by white people who are prejudiced,
but never have I been as apalled at
racism as I have become at Pitt; black
vs. white and white vs. black.

Why can’t I feel comfortable walk-
ing through the Towers Lobby late Fri-
day night just because I am white. It’s
almost as if I am invading “black”
territory.

I thought during Martin Luther
King’s time there was opposition to
blacks having to sit in the back of the
bus. Now, it's the place I usually see
blacks sit. I understand it is the freedom
of choice which is important here. But
why do blacks segregate themselves in
the Tower A cafeteria in addition.

I would like us all to join an
American Human Action Society, and
we all can become the solution to this
ridiculous problem. Let’s not let things
get any worse, it isn’t worth the
negative energy.

McCray

This past Monday, I woke to find
myself down to my last dollar. One
hundred pennies and my next check
was four days away. As fate would
have it. that day the TV networks
conspired to air more CARE and
UNICEF spots than I’d ever seen
before. I envisioned myself combing
back alleys and bus stops for Burger
King wrappers. This was the closest
I’d ever come to that forlorn state
known as destitution.

Fortunately, rationality prevailed.
I would hit my friends up for a few
bucks, call in some IOUs and, if need
be. beg shamelessly from my room-
mate. Besides, macaroni and cheese
is only 22 cents a box. But a shed of
the alarm that struck on Monday re-
mained, and I felt a heightened sense
of pity for those without my generous
friends.

Ask yourself: What is the greatest
threat. the most heinous crime, ex-
isting in our world? Thermo-nuclear
war? Racial discordance? Terrorist
acts? Starvation? Long lines at
Thackery Hall? Still perplexed? Well,
how about a hint? The answer is
poverty. That's right, economic

Silver And Gold

disparity is at the root of practically
all crises in the world today. George
Bernard Shaw himself called poverty
the worst of crimes.

Why poverty? Because it deprives
people of their dignity as human be-
ings. It creates jealousy and hatred
while crushing the body and soul in
its callous grip. It denies people the
chance to develop their minds, their
lives. to the fullest — as in the phrase
‘ ‘underdeveloped nation. ” Economic
inequality affects our society on all
levels —— from the wino on Bouquet
Street, to the unemployed, to the
refugees and to the starving.

Can someone honestly think of a
problem that is not related, in some
way, to poverty? Statistics show that
our nation's high divorce rate is
largely due to family money short-
ages and the arguments resulting
from these. Everybody’s favorite
soapbox, apartheid, can partly be
traced to economic oppression, and
starvation is the result of economic
mismanagement.

Perhaps the Reagan administration
could take some time to realize why

communism appeals so readily to the
populace in Third World countries.
Why? Because in its purest form it
promises economic equality. What
does a grass-roots farmer in Central

’America want with capitalism, with
democracy, when he can’t afford to
buy his own garden? Helmut
Schmidt,‘ in his recent appearance at
Pitt, afﬁrmed these views. The
former chancellor of West Germany
stated that “economic depression
leads to the weakening of democratic
stability." Still a doubting Thomas?
Take a look at Nicaragua. And El
Salvador. And South Africa and
Ethiopia and the whole damn Soviet
revolution.

We've recently witnessed Band
Aid, Live Aid and Farm Aid. Less
than two weeks ago, the Peace Corps
commemorated its silver anniversary.
All this is well, but more, much
more, needs to be done. It’s time to
stop treating the symptoms and get to
the corrupt heart of the disease that
plagues and blights our existence.
Like the slogan says, “If you want
peace, work for justice.” Justice,
everybody. ‘Economic justice.

Simply Speaking/Tim van Gelder
Lies, Damned Eies And Nuclear Testing

The United Nations has passed resolu-
tion after resolution urging the Reagan
administration to begin negotiating a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
Congress just passed a resolution de-
manding a halt to nuclear testing. The
Soviet Union has proposed negotiating a
comprehensive ban and has undertaken
its own unilateral testing moratorium.
The United States has even signed two
treaties requiring it to negotiate a com-
prehensive ban on nuclear testing. De-
spite all of this, the Reagan administra-
tion still refuses to consider halting its
nuclear testing. In effect, it is refusing
to consider halting the nuclear arms race.
Why?

The administration is desperately de-
fending its ability to conduct nuclear
testing because the testing of new weap-
ons is necessary for the continuation of
its military build—up and in particular for
the Star Wars program. Despite Reagan's
naive misconception that Star Wars
would be non-nuclear, crucial elements
of the space offense system rely on

nuclear weapons — for example, the
nuclear-pumped X-ray laser. So Star
Wars needs nuclear testing for its sur-
vival, and Star Wars itself cannot be sur-
rendered because of a combination of the
foolish dreams of a president who has lost
his grip on reality and the stranglehold
that massive defense contracting corpora-
tions such as Boeing and Rockwell have
on our economic and defense priorities.

To conceal and disguise these rather
unpalatable motives, the administration
proffers various arguments against join-
ing with the Soviet Union in a testing
moratorium. One of these arguments goes
as follows. Before entering its mora-
torium in July last year, the Soviet Union
had completed an unusually extensive
series, of nuclear tests. The moratorium,
it is argued, is only a propaganda ploy
designed to preserve the Soviets’ lead in
the nuclear arms race.

The problems with this argument are
so many that it is mystifying how any
reasonably well—informed person could
take it seriously. Most obviously, it false-

Page 5

ly presumes that the Soviets have a
technological lead — as opposed to a lead
in numbers of land-based ICBM war-
heads — in the arms race. But this com-
mon misconception is less insidious than
another way in which the argument
grievously distorts the circumstances sur-
rounding the Soviet moratorium. Let us
look for just a moment at what really hap-
pened — according to figures available
from the U.S. Department of Energy.
In July 1985, a month before announc-
ing its moratorium, the Soviet Union con-
ducted three nuclear tests, one of which
is believed by Swedish authorities to have
been a “peaceful” nuclear explosion.
That brou ht their total number of tests
for the yeaéto seven. Does this constitute
an “unusually extensive” series of tests‘?
Consider the following. Seven tests is less
than the total number of tests the Soviets
made in the same period in both 1984 (1 1
tests) and 1983 (13). Further, and more
importantly, the Soviet total of seven tests
is less than the total number of U.S. tests
for the same period (9 tests). Clearly, the

idea that the Soviets had just completed
an unusually extensive series of tests is
absurd — the Soviet tests was not even
as extensive as our own testing in that
same period.

Even more absurd is the common sug-
gestion that the Soviets had already com-
pleted their scheduled testing for the year
anyway. Between 1980 and 1984 the
Soviets made, on average, 25 nuclear
tests a year. What makes anyone suppose
that the Soviets suddenly found them-
selves only needing seven tests for 1985?

Given that the mythical accelerated
testing series never took place, does it
make sense to say that the Soviet mora-
torium is nothing more than a propagan-
da ploy? Hardly — for how on earth can
you get ahead in the arms race by halting
your testing‘? The Soviet Union cannot
even hope to catch up with the United
States, let alone preserve a lead, by enter-
ing a unilateral moratorium. The painful
obviousness of this point testifies to the
ideological blindfolding necessary to sus-
tain the view that the Soviet initiative is

Making A Difference

Sometimes after giving a speech,
someone asks how as a columnist I
have made a difference. At that, I,
double up with false modesty and
declare that, given the complexity of
the world, I could never hope to make
a difference. Now, however, I can. I
have invented the low-calorie egg
cream.

An egg cream is a little gift from the
gods. It is what the Greeks were refer-
ring to when they made such a fuss
about wine (things got mangled in
translation), And it is what would
replace wine as the drink ordinaire of
the people extraordinaire, should they
ever serve it in France. It is, quite
simply, heaven in a glass. In other
words, it is chocolate syrup, soda water
and a little bit of milk.

It is also fattening. This was not a
problem for me when I was a kid and
addicted to egg creams. They cost a

dime and I had at least four or five of
them a day. Back then, you could get
an egg cream anywhere — a candy
store, a drugstore — and I used to make
them at home. I was so addicted to egg
creams that even when the know-
nothing dermatologist told me they
caused pimples, I drank them anyway.
Given a choice between clear skin,
popularity with girls, romance, sex 
and  egg creams, I chose the latter.
You would, too, if you ever had one.

But alas, it had been years since I had
had one. Then some time ago, Bob
Greene, a fellow columnist and you can
see from his pictures, a guy with a bit
of a weight problem, discovered Can-
f1eld’s diet fudge drink. He wrote about
it in his column and I, like lots of
others, tried it. Delicious. For two
calories, you got a terrific chocolate
drink. God, how I envied Greene. Here

was a columnist who had actually made
a difference.

What Greene started, I have finished.
One night, about to down a Canfield’s,
my eye stopped on a container of 2 per-
cent milk. I poured a little of the milk
into a tall glass. I added the Canfield’s.
I watched that head of foam rise to the
top. With shaking hands, I raised the
glass to my lips. Oh boy! An egg
cream.

You cannot imagine my joy. I had
one and then another. I made my wife
taste one. My son, too. I experimented
some more. A little more milk. A lit-
tle less milk. Finally, I had the right
proportions. Here they are. Put some
milk into a glass and add the Can-
field’s.

I concede that the new Cohencream
(patent pending) is not without calories.

would not have enough body for a good

tablespoon of cornstarch (29 calories),

It is not every day that you can recap-

“mere” propaganda.

Of course-, there is a degree of propa-
ganda advantage to be had from being the
only superpower to have unilaterally
suspended‘ nuclear weapons development,
and I don’t doubt that the Soviets are
reveling in it. We have to realize,
however, that their moratorium is also
more than propaganda. The Soviets have
their own good reasons for fearing future
developments in the arms race, and their
self-interest — like ours — lies in halting
it where it is, right now. The unfortunate
part is that the Reagan administration,
persisting in its pursuit of the myth of
nuclear superiority through technology,
refuses to do its part — or rather, our part
~ in response. Rather, it chooses to
generate its own version of conservative
propaganda by deliberately falsifying the
record of events. Those who think the
Soviet moratorium is merely propagan-
da have themselves fallen prey to prop-
aganda of a most pernicious form —
namely, propaganda that masquerades as
historical fact.

Clovis Maksud, ambassador of the
Arab League to the United Nations,
contended Tuesday that Middle East
conﬂicts are in part being fueled by
Israeli actions. According to Maksud,
central to the region’s ongoing dif-
ficulties is Israel’s refusal to loosen its
grasp on the West Bank.

“To achieve peace, one must
mitigate injustice,” the ambassador
told the colloquium on security.
“There is in Israel a mind-state that the
West Bank was God—given to Israel ...
This mind-state is closed on the pros—

Maksud said Israel’s refusal to
liberate the West Bank contributed at
least in part to the emergence of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.

“All Palestinians  do not wish to
be transferred to the West Bank,” he
said. “They do, though, seek an iden-
tity and a state  that represents this
identity so that they may have a form
of self-expression. The PLO is a state
of mind for the Palestinian people in
the absence of a state.”

Israel, Maksud pointed out, has yet
to recognize the PLO. This, he alleges,
has aggravated Middle East problems.

“Any attempt to curtail the PLO 

Official criticizes Israel in Wes

bassador stated. “Never in the annals
of contemporary diplomatic history has
a negotiator sought to determine who
is the representative of the opposing
party.”

Maksud made clear that he felt the
Israelis are motivated by a fear of the
Nazi holocaust.

“We in the Arab world understand
the reasons that have led to a Jewish
solidarity,” he said. “There is a ten-
dancy to think of the Palestinians as the

‘re-creation of the Holocaust.”

the evening, Dr. Rober Heller, a pro-
fessor at Tel Aviv University, took a

ing to Heller, the West Bank is an in-
tegral part of Israel and should not be
relinquished. The territory, he alleges,
is “a very important part of Jewish
heritage.”

As for the PLO, Heller feels the
Israeli government should not
recognize or negotiate with the
organization, claiming it has “an in-
trinsic reason to negate Israel’s ex-
istence. ” The professor praised Prime
Minister Perez’s recent decision to ab-

BRAZIL

 

By Michael Ashford

For those filmmakers who are in-
terested in it, “thefuture” presents a_
boundless opportunity for them to ex-
plore their creative potential. And
director Terry Gilliam, in his film Brazil,
has shown the film-viewing world just
where his singularly bizarre imagina-
tion will lead in doing so.

Gilliam’s future is one where a
visceral welfare state has reached un-
foreseeable success at regulating
almost every aspect of human life. The
guts of this state’s bureaucracy are
literally spilling into the lives of its
citizens, as one scene suggests when
gurgling and burbling air-conditioning
tubes invade the protagonist’s apart-
ment after state-employed plumbers
arrive, equipped with the proper forms,
of course, to make minor adjustments.
The paper produced by this bureauc-

Avant-Garvde Realism

 

racy, as a later scene demonstrates,
is enough to suffocate those who dare
refuse conformity.

Brazil portrays the anxious exploits
of, Sam Lowry, played by Jonathan
Pryce, a prototype of the Weberian
loyal and hardworking bureaucrat.
Sam is torn from his vocation and the
doting attention of his sniveling boss
by the seductress of all ages, Fortune
herself. She is embodied in the char-
acter of Jill Clayton, played by Kim
Greist. a lower-class truck driver and
the unsuspecting angel of Sam’s
dreams. A fateful “bug in the works”
brings the two together when Sam, in
the pursuit of duty, ventures off to Ji|l’s

s wretched apartment complex in the

suburbs-. Sam’s love for Jill or rather,
his obsessive desire to fulfill his fan-
tasies, drives him to abuse the bu-
reaucratic privileges he has so diligent-
ly worked for. Ultimately, it leads him
to confront the state machine itself.

The ensuing mayhem degenerates
into a carnivalesque confusion of
Sam’s romantic fantasy and the
Stalinist reality in which he lives. The
adventure climaxes, suffice it to say,
into two rigid jolts of the utopian and
the tragic.

The structure of the film follows the
convergence of Sam’s beatific dreams
and nightmarish waking-life. The ex-
tremes of this paradox are illustrated
by Tim Beard’s enthralling art direc-
tion. In Sam’s dreams, we fly with him
through billowy clouds high above the
pastoral beauty of rolling hills. These
sometimes nightmarish dream se-
quences are loaded with the grotesque
and fantastic animation of Monty
Python fame. in Sam’s day-to-day life,
we are overwhelmed with oppressive-
ly cluttered scenes of offices packed
with buzzing machines and whirring
computers. Looming skyscrapers and
streets crowded to capacity during the
Christmas hectic, sometime in the 20th
century, add to the effect.

All this further enhanced by a
tremendous cinematography. Early in
the film, for example, the camera
rushes through the bustling office of
the Department of Information Re-
trieval, where Sam works. This creates

inside:

   
  

. riot “-
‘ Light shines
through

at Carnegie

. see page 12

 

a fantastic dizzying effect as the office
employees dodge and dart acrossthe
path of the camera as it dollies forward

» at about waist height. In other scenes,

the camera is strategically placed at
angles which exaggerate closed and
cluttered spaces; the image’s periph-
ery is often congested with a plethora
of protruding objects which are always
in somebody’s way. These contrast
sharply with vast wide-angle shots of
open spaces, like the dizzying drop off
the edge of Sam’s apartment balcony
or the gaping abyss at the core of a
building where Sam’s nightmare and
reality finally collide.

The state-owned office and apart-
ment buildings of Gilliam’s future are
all heavy pre-World War ll fascist ar-
chitecture. Taken together, the ar-
chitecture, clothes and archaic tech-
nology depict a world in which prog-
ress seems to have ended in the
1930s, though time kept passing.
Some have called it “retro-future.”

Retro, of course, denotes the film’s
pervasive 1930s aura, but at the same
time may well refer to those elements
which are drawn from a very contem-
porary world. The rigid society of class
and status portrayed in the film, for ex-

[Horton Foote’s Trip to Wonderful

By Matthew Yokobosky

Early in life, one experiences; later,
one remembers. To be young is to be
free; to be old is to be chained to the
past. Year after year our bodies
degenerate, while our minds generate
memories. To be old is to be ripe; to
be young, green. -

Written by Horton Foote, The Trip To
Bountiful analyzes the last days of
Mother Watts (Geraldine Page), a
woman yearning to escape the torment
of her, daughter-in-law’s domain and
return to her childhood home.

Reliving the past through flashbacks
is a common technique in cinema; in
that, dialogue never seems to exactly
express experiences. When we
remember, often we remember the
good times as great times and the bad
as the worst. We extrapolate treasured
remnants and bronze the tongue for all
to enjoy. So upon seeing Bountiful, you
realize that Mother Watts’ dialogue is
testimony to her golden years of youth,
but you question her validity. Were the
good ol’ times the best?

Aging in America has become a na-
tional wonder, as people in the modern
age of medicine are living life, though
spent. Once an older citizen reaches
65, the body has weakened and activi-
ty is more or less a memory. But in
1947, few lived to be septuagenarians,
and families —— not institutions — cared
for their loved ones. Set in Texas,
Mother‘Watts must depend on her son
Ludie (John Heard) and Jessie Mae’s
(Carlyn Glynn) duty. In order to age
gracefully, Mother wants to escape the
tension of her son’s marriage. Mother
wants to return to her childhood home,_

     
 

Bountiful, where people worked the
land and kept their emotions inside —
a place where pride reigned over dirty
laundry. \

When Mother moved in 20 years
ago, her father and husband had long

to tend. Her son had a career and a

modern wife, who vented her anxieties
seemingly to remedy the problems.
But Ludie, being his mother’s child,
cannot make decisions or understand
his wife’s unrest. But both_Jessie Mae

and Mother feel trapped. Jessie Mae,

cannot lunch or shop, but neither can
Mother due to Jessie Mae’s obligatory
tending of the older person with a heart

since died, and the farm was too much

condition. So, while Mother moved to
comfort her son and to abandon the
financial obligations of the land, she
lost her independence and her
freedom to keep in harmony with
nature.

The remainder of the film focuses on

Mother’s trip to Bountiful. On the bus
ride, she meets young and virtuous
Thelma (Rebecca‘De Mornay) whom
she views as her girlhood friend. She
tells tales of her youth and acts like a
secretive companion, eating sand-
wiches, checking purses, walking and
talking like two ladies by the stream.
Their relationship builds, and parallels
between the 1890s morality and the

1947 changes in female social politics
become established. While Jessie Mae
epitomizes the hard-driving woman
behind the man, Thelma is content to
wait for her husband and assume
vulnerability. Clinging to decency and
tradi-Sci.-§‘~«: remain in the small towns, a
place lovingly named Bountiful.

Perhaps the film is long-winded with
whispers of sentiment and pathos, but
inconsideration of Geraldine Page’s
convincing portrayal of the worn and
solemn Mother Watts, it seems that
The Trip To Bountiful is perhaps a
perfect film though it is clearly a vehi-
cle for Page, who is best known for her
roles as aging cliches. The textures of
the film are warm and washed, the
humor is subtle and the conflicts are
reasonably secure. The major problem
is Carlyn Glynn. While her Jessie Mae
is a “type,” her believability wanes as
she seems to always be aware of the
camera. She plays to the camera;
whereas, in this film, the camera
should just be incidental. But then she
is Peter Waterson’s wife, and directors
often trust their wives too readily in
Hollywood.

Originally The Trip To Bountiful was
a 1953 TV movie on “The Goodyear
Television Playhouse,” starring Lillian
Gish. Later it was the first teleplay to
be purchased by the Museum of
Modern Art. After 30-odd years,_ it
seems that Horton Foote’s original
story is a classic. The Trip To Bountiful
is a delicate and endearing portrait of
an older lady caught in the whirlwind
of remembrance. We can never lose
memories, we can only hope that they
will be fond.

Goldie Hawn Tackles and Scores in Wildcats

By Lori Faiella .
What starts as a joke turns into a
“real” game when Molly McGrath
decides to follow in her father’s
footsteps and coach boys’ football.

Having grown up with the game; she
is confident all will go well until she

meets the Wildcats, face-to-face,
dressed only from the waist up. Gulp-
ing down the shock, she plunges into

the new challenge slightly uncertain
but determined. Originally she had ap-
plied for a position with the JV team at
a respectable high school, but
members of the board “kindly” found
her another, more challenging
position.

As the new coach for Central High,
which is located in the inner city, she
gets more than she had bargained for.

Dobermans and armed guards help to
make up the schools security system

_ — hinting at the school’s reputation.

And, for some odd reason, the tough
city boys find it hard to accept her as
their new coach.

Goldie Hawn stars as Molly
McGrath. Cute, sweet, petite and
somewhat unsuited for her new posi-

winning their total devotion as well as
the team championship. lt’s not a very
realistic role; in real life these animals
from the locker room would probably
have assaulted her in some way, but
it ,is...entertaining.

Hawn is her usual bubbly self. Some
of her previous comedies include Foul

Off with Uncle
Steve’s head

We are thoroughly disgusted and
repulsed by Stephen Morrison’s very
feeble attempt at humor or perhaps
self-amusement in his “Singles” col-
umn. His contribution seriously impairs
any attempt to offer entertaining or
valuable opinions. He has no taste, no
talent and no tact. Who does this sort
of moronic and imbecilic humor appeal
to? The campus chainsaw murderer?

And Mr. Morrison’s records? Think
we’ve ever heard of his very few grade-
A tunes? Where does he dig up these
discs? Anything even remotely familiar
to the average Pitt student he shoots
to hell with his awkward, mindless and
psychotic critique. '

We have to wonder at Mr. Morri-
son’s intentions when he writes
“Singles” reviews. Does he find it
amusing somehow? We fail to see
anything of worth. Please Mr. Morri-

son, get a lifestyle.

Dear Uncle Steve.

lt was with great dismay that I read
your proclamation in the March 7 issue
of Showcase. Could the Violent
Femmes possibly be considered “the
greatest band in the history of
American music” after only three
albums (two of which are of ques-
tionable quality)? Dig the wax out of
your youthful ears and listen to a few
“other” American bands like The
Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and C.C.R.
How about the Velvet Underground, a
group that Gordon Gano obviously
worships, who had released a string of

Letters

classic albums before Gano had struck
his first guitar chord?

l could also suggest a list of more
“contemporary” American bands for
you to sample, such as Husker Du,
Talking Heads, The Replacements
and Fl.E.M. Steve, you’ve really got to
get out more often. I could go on, but
I'll try to forgive you for your blithering
overestimation of a good band that has
not yet proven itself to be a great one.
Feel free to sit down with me anytime
and share in some truly tasty American
musical cuisine. Your palate would
definitely benefit from the experience.

of Showcase this week. It was very well
done. But where was G.B.’s “Style”
section? I’m sure he has something
sleazy to talk about. Me and my friends
in the Towers get our best tips from
“Style”!

Desperately Seeking G.B.

Not pleased
with “sleaze”

Just what is the purpose of your
newspaper anyway? I thought The Pitt
News was supposed to be for the
benefit of the entire student body,
reporting “qua|ity” news stories wor-
thy to be printed in such a fine and
well—respected periodical such as
yours. Maybe that’s the problem; you
get little respect, therefore you give
very little to your readers in the way of
responsible journalism.

Surely you could’ve
something newsworthy to take up the
pages you devoted to last Friday’s
Showcase. Instead you decide to
publish a “Special Sleaze Edition”
with a theme of “Sleaze ‘N’
Decadence.” Well, you certainly have
a good understanding of the word
“decadence” as you’ve exhibited the
meaning quite poignantly. Instead of
striving for journalistic excellence
you’ve managed to reach the epitome
of thoughtless, reprobatory reporting.
Regardless of whether or not you
assumed this “special” edition would
be of benefit to the students, it shows
a clear lack of maturity and
tastefulness. If you thought this would
come under the rubric of “humor,”
wrong again. Pornography‘ is not a
laughing matter. The attitude con-
veyed in your paper is exactly the prob-
lem today concerning this subject.
People take it too lightly and pretend
that no one is hurt by porno flicks, porn
magazines, prostitution, etc. —— the
whole spectrum that you so casually
printed black on white for us to read
and see. It has become a “fun” topic
for discussion and for writers. Sorry
folks, i don’t think those people —
mainly women and children — whose
lives have been controlled, degraded
and ruined by such a serious and
powerful business would see anything
funny about your advocacy of such
“utter filth.”

I certainly found nothing funny,
worthwhile or respectable in your
“special” edition; it was, however, in-
teresting in that it was a sad commen-
tary on the state of our society.

—The Pittsburgh Public Theater Rises and Conquers—

By ‘Susan Washburn

Confusion, mistaken identities and
romance characterize Pittsburgh
Public Theater’s virtually flawless pro-
duction of She Stoops to Conquer. The

play is a late 18th century comedy of *

the mishaps and the mistakes of a
night (which, incidentally, is the orginal
title). Young Kate Hardcastle is to meet
Marlow, a suitor, and decide if he
would make an appropriate husband.
However, the devious Tony Lumpkin

reaches him first, setting the scene for .

a playful romp through the intricacies
of romance.

The Hardcastles are well-bred
aristocrats who enjoy the simplicity of
country living. Marlow, too, is well-bred
and a world traveler. He is able to woo
any common woman but falters in the
presence of a real “lady.” Michel R.
Gill and Sarah Rush complement each
other tremendously on stage. At their
first meeting, Marlow is intimidated by

‘ Kate’s mere presence. Nerves impair

his speech, and her virtue overwhlems
him so that he can’t even look the love-
ly lady in the face; Gill’s actions are a
bit too exaggerated but are funny,
nonetheless. Sarah Rush confidently
displays the independence and virtue
of Kate Hardcastle. As Marlow stutters
and stumbles about, Kate seizes con-
trol of the situation. She converses
easily and evokes broken but mean-
ingful responses from Marlow. Kate

sees not a bumbling fool, but a man
she could marry. Thus, she stoops to
the position of a servant to capture her
suitor.

The second encounter. is quite dif-
ferent from the first flop. Instead of see-
ing Kate as an aristocrat, he sees her

 

as a servant — and a very pretty one
at that. Again, Gill and Flush display
-their abilities as performers. Their ver-
satility is evident, and their sense of
timing and movement are perfectly
synchronized. Marlow eloquently
praises Kate’s beauty and chases her
about the room, professing his love,
without realizing her true identity.
Eventually, her identity is revealed

   
   

and Marlow realizes that it’s not one’s
title but one’s personality that deter-
mines how relationhips work. Gill, in
the end scene, is endearing as he
realizes his mistake and agrees to
marry Kate.

The other characters complement

the dynamic duo of Gill and Rush.
Sarah Trubey Walker and Mark
Chamberlin are the other romantic
item in the play as well as being the
confidants of Kate and Marlow. Both
create believable characters and
together create a charming relation-
ship between them.

William Swetland as Mr. Hardcastle

is amusing as he grapples with his 0-
pinion of Marlow. For Marlow mistakes
him for a lowly innkeeper and treats
him as such. Marlow’s demands are
outrageous to Hardcastle, and he
thinks Marlow an egotistical,
ungrateful man. The relationship be-
tween these two men lends itself to
several hilarious scenes.

Also entertaining is Don Fischer as
the mischievous and embarrasing son
of Mrs. Hardcastle (by a previous mar-
riage). His boyish playfulness is
wonderfully conveyed by Fischer.

While the entire cast expertly han-
dled their parts, my compliments go to
Carmen Mathews, who portrayed Mrs.
Hardcastle. Mathews turned a poten-
tially common and ordinary character
into an extraordinarily funny part.
Although her character is not em-
phasized as much as some of the
others, when on stage, she delivers the
best independent performance.

She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver
Goldsmith is a playful comedy with
underlying themes that are applicable
to today’s world. The characters are
colorful and animated and the plot ‘in-
tricate but not confusing. Also, the
humor Goldsmith uses is universal,
giving She Stoops to Conquer the
power to withstand the test of time.
PPT’s production is expertly cast and

credits the genuis of the author by '
‘ entertaining audiences more than 200

years after the play was written.

By Michael Blunt

Years ago, I was forced to read -
Henrik lbsen’s play Hedda Gabler for
a theater appreciation course. I o-
pened my textbook and proceeded to
fall asleep in the«middle of the third act.
Why anyone would want to read this
play, let alone produce it, was beyond
me. Later, I ran across a book of
Woody Allen’s that included a parody
of scenes from this particular play-. The
series of lampoons therein reinforced
my basic belief that Hedda Gabler was
a waste of time.

Surprisingly, Pitt’s production of
Hedda Gabler turned out to be a fast
paced, witty, beautifully done piece
that intrigued and entertained the au-
dience with its fascinating twists and
turns. We witnessed a dynamic group
of individuals give their all and perform
their material with seeming ease. -

Victoria Herd led the cast with an un-
forgettable portrayal of Hedda. Herd
succeeded in capturing the very spirit
of the persona Ibsen so masterfully
created. Herd’s performance didn’t
end with her last line; rather, it lingered
on a bit afterwards. Thinking back on
the play, you remember how she, with
just a glance, gave a small clue now
and then of something yet to come. It
might have been a meaningless reply
to a question that was at the same time
filled with meaning. After watching
Herd’s performance, it becomes clear
why the play is required reading in a
theater course, and why it should be
produced.

Every male character in the play is
after Hedda. With all of these “would
be” lovers around, you would think

\

A Light and Charm

that George Tesman, her husband, is
the most fortunate. This isn’t the’ case.
George has Hedda but doesn’t have
the slightest idea what to do with her.
David Klein, in his role as George, was
quite comical as he shuffles around the
stage totally preoccupied with his
work, never allowing his voice to dip
below a high C. Even though'Klein’s

voice became nerve-racking by the
third act, he did carry himself well.
However oblivious George is regard-
ing his surroundings, he holds a
special place in his heart for his dear

Aunt Ju-Ju, the woman who raised ,

him. M. Susan Peck was quite ap-
propriate as the doting aunt who sees
the good in all of us. Auntie Ju-Ju is
always able to find the silver lining in
the darkest cloud.
Thea Elvsted, played by Kathleen
- Tessarro, has everything Hedda wants
and represents everything, Hedda is
not. Their relationship is similar to that

' n g Hedda

of say Scarlet O’Hara and Melanie in
Gone With the Wind, with Tessarro
representing that one good friend who
possessed saint-like qualities. The sad
part_ is that Thea never gets what she
wants in the end, even though she
bends over backwards for everyone

else. Tessarro did her job well. She in-
stilled a sense of sorrow and pity that

 
   

Joseph Comm'V:‘a'nd"i’.Victoria erd

was truly empathetic.

Eilert Loevborg, the one man Hed-
da really wants, is unfortunately taken
by Thea. Hedda tries just about
everything to get Eilert, at everyone‘
else’s expense, of course. Loevborg is
caught in the middle. Joseph Comm
tended to play the part of Loevborg a
bit too dramatically, speaking each line
as if it were his last. Comm displayed
some insight, however, and did his ut-
most to take advantage of Hedda
when possible. Nonetheless, Hedda
has complete power over him. Comm

should have been a bit more forceful

Gabler —-

Finally, Earl D. Childs, in his role as
Judge Brack, was a dashing, debonair
individual, well-versed in the various
social graces of the period. The Judge
is also bound and determined to get
Hedda for himself. As Hedda’s foe,
Brack knows exactly how she operates
and finally resorts to blackmail to get
what he wants. Hedda remains just
one step ahead of him, though, and he
is ultimately thwarted.

Director Kenyon Barr managed to
make this production possibly one of
the finest this season by bringing out
subtle nuances within the script and

downplaying aspects other directors -

might have taken more seriously.
The costumes, designedby Peter
Harrigan, were resplendent and
ranged from tails to lace. Harrigan had
each character clothed, l feel, exactly

as they were intended — splendid ex- _

tensions of each character’s in-
dividuality. Take any one accessory
away and there would be
diminishment. . .

Nothing is perfect, and although this
play glistened, there were some
lighting difficulties that need to be ad-
dressed. A major portion of the first act
had everyone walking around in
shadows. Had this production not been
in the round, very important facial ex-
pressions would have been lost.
Another distraction was the volume.
Often, a majority of the cast could not
be heard, though it diminished as the
show progressed.

When you get down to it, Hedda
Gabler was an enjoyable evening.-lf
you have the opportunity to see it, do. .

Spring is just a few short days away.
With it comes new leaves, new
romance and new fashion trends.
Fashion, like many other things,
changes with the breeze, moving in
large circles. This spring offers new
“looks” for the fashion-conscious guy.
These “looks” aren’t anything new,
though. The oversized trend will still
dominate the lines of clothing. We’ll
just see the big cut in ice cream colors.
To be honest, there’s absolutely
nothing new.

What will make the mark this spring
then? What will get you noticed? The
answer lies not in clothing this season.

What sets the fashion elite apart from
the pack this season is jewelry. Be it
a large brooch, a distinctive watch, an
earring or a chain — the accessorv 59:
the key. An important thing to
remember is that one of these articles
will make you look chic. More will make
you look stupid.

Overcoats gain an esprit de corps
with the addition of a mock-military
brooch. For those of you who prefer
not to look like Michael Jackson, a
smaller brooch, worn instead of a tie,
will add a little splash to your semi-

several alternatives to these jet set

is dressy enough to wear anytime, and

Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet

After more than three years of
silence, Bob Seger and his band are
releasing a new LP on the 21st of this

garnering airplay on Top 40 and AOR
stations alike. Deservedly? Yes in-

Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band

 

ing the airwaves lately, this is the first
one that rings true. That is because
here, as always, Seger walks the
tightrope between undiluted artistic
creation and popular appeal, and he
makes it look easy. Seger does not
deliberately write hits; he just can’t

help it. There are few in rock music
who can boast of his ability to write
songs that on one hand are straight
from his heart but that at the same time
manage to hit a common chord with
whole segments of the American
population. Springsteen can do this;
John Cougar Mellencamp is learning
to do it; but only Seger, so far, has
shown the ability to flirt with superstar-

failure. The Hiiskers’ last single,
“Makes No Sense At All,’’ was a diz-
zying showcase of the band’s talent in
a pure form: roaring guitar, frenzied,
unbridled musicianship and a vocal
melody that could almost be called

“pretty” if Bob Mou|d’s voice wasn’t
so scary. ,
On this, their latest single (or EP,
maxi-single or whatever the hell you
want to call it), Htisker Dii’s major-label-
-debut is marred by three songs of
uneven quality, with lots of minor highs
and lows but nothing stunning. The
opener is a solid but unconvincing
Grant Hart song with clean production
and characteristically intelligent lyrics,
but it could have been an outtake from
Zen Arcade. it’s followed on side A by
a deafening live reworking of the in-

lfamous Beatles classic, with Hart at-

tempting in vain to follow the original
Paul McCartney melody and Mould’s
white-noise shrieks adding contrapun-
tal mayhem. it gives you some idea of
the intensity of their live performances,
but you also wish the thing would end,
and it finally does, after five very long
minutes. Side B is a repetitious toss-
off called “All Work and No Play,” ap-
parently inspired by a famous scene

from The Shining, which repeats the
couplet All work and no play/Makes
Jack a dull boy over and over and over.
A cute idea, but it doesn’t make for en-
thralling listening when it’s dragged on
forjthe better part of 10 minutes.

band’s stuff is, I’m looking forward to

their new LP (yes, another one). It '

The Hooters: Day by Day

In the rock history books, The
Hooters will not be remembered as
anything more than a somewhat
energetic Philadelphia quintet who
were touted as being “young” and
“fresh” but who in reality were a very
traditional, ordinary and ultimately un-
exciting group that scored a couple of

hitsand faded away. They aren’t bad; -
but their sentimental dedication to ‘

Rock will keep them from making any
significant contribution in the long-term
arena. Arena, in fact, is a fitting word
because “Day by Day” epitomizes the
brainless sort of ’70s arena-rock in
which this band trades. Basically, The
Hooters are a slightly more melodic

—Renaissance Woodwinds Offer a Breath of FreshAir——

By David Zuchowski

in the March 4, 1986 edition of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Robert
Grimes of California, Pa., wrote a let-
ter to the editor complaining of the lack
of musical coverage by the Pittsburgh
news media. Especially bothersome to
Grimes was the failure of our city’s
music reporters to mention, at least in
passing, one of our smaller local
groups, the Renaissance City Wood-
wind Quintet. Well, The Pitt News, like
Nature herself, abhors a vacuum and
immediately set out to rectify this ob-
vious oversight and injustice. Hence
the following article.

The Renaissance Woodwind
Quintet was formed 12 years ago by
local graduate students simply for the
pleasure of playing the classical wood-
wind repertoire. The vagaries of time
being what they are, the ensemble’s
membership has changed since its in-
ception and is currently composed of
an oboist from Florida, a bassoonist
from Philadelphia, a clarinetist from
Atlanta, a flutist from Upper St. Clair
and a horn player, Keith Powell, from
New York.

Powell tells of his experiences in
joining the group. ‘‘I was just a student
in Milwaukee when I saw an ad for a
horn player for the Renaissance
Woodwind Quintet, came to Pittsburgh
for an audition and was granted the

position. My artistic goal had always
been to play with a small wind ensem-
ble and the quintet has proved to be
just what I’d been looking for. All but
one of the instrumentalists in the group
are from cities other than Pittsburgh,

and although we love the town, we’ve
had a hard time getting our concerts
publicized and even more difficulty. get-
ting them reviewed.”

“Our final concert of the current
season is a gala festival entitled
‘Winds Around the World,’ a two-day
musical tour of six European countries:
England, Italy, Hungary, France, Ger-
many and Russia.” The concerts will

be held on Saturday and Sunday after-
noons, March 15 and 16'at 1:30 p.m.
at the Frick Fine Arts building in
Oakland. The concerts will be held in

conjunctioniwith the famous Nationali-
ty Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning.
After both days’ concerts, ticket
holders will be taken on a guided tour
of the Nationality Rooms. Powell would
like this colaborationl between the
Woodwind Quintet and the Nationali-
ty Rooms to become an annual event

here. But he’d prefer to have future V

concerts held in the Stephen Foster
Memorial Theater as it’s “much more
accessible to the Nationality Rooms
than is the Frick building.” _

Each of the concerts will be divided
into three parts, each part devoted to
the music of a particular country. Local
personages such as Mark Yacovane,
WQED’s afternoon announcer, ' or
Richard Schultz, WQED’s music critic,
will lecture on the music of one of the
six countries prior to the musical ex-
position bythe quintet.

English compositions will feature
works by'Holst, Britten and Vinter. ita-
ly will be represented by Vivaldi, Ver-
di, Rossini and Cavalini; Hungary by
Farkas, Scerrvansky and Hidas;
France by Gounod, Bozza, Pierne,
Debussy and Brod; Russia by Liadov,
Berezowsky and Kremin; ‘and Ger-
many by Praetorius, Bach, Stamitz and
Schutz.

Student tickets are $6 per concert or
$9 for both Saturday and Sunday
series. For further information, call

KING OF AMERICA
The Costello Show
Columbia Records

Elvis Costello is no more. The man
beneath the jeweled crown _on the
sleeve of King of America has
Costel|o’s sober countenance but his
name is Declan Patrick Aloysius Mac-
Manus. You see, last year Elvis often
found his name littered throughout the

-British tabloids. Several questions’.

were raised: Had his marriage failed?
Was he an alcoholic? Had his com-
positional skills failed him? Elvis’
response was to legally reclaim his
given name and concentrate on the
making of a new album without the
services of his band, the Attractions.
The ‘result is King of America, an asser-
tion of the redemptive powers of love,
a commentary upon the crumbling
American dream and the best album
i have heard in over a year.

As Costello himself has declared,
King of America is so radically different
from its competition in the record store
racks that it might well be considered
“punk.” Except the term “punk”
would be inappropriate for an album
that features acoustic instruments
almost exclusively. There is Elvis’ im-

  Long Live The King  

pressive guitarwork (he reportedly
finished the final
Gulch” with only four strings), man-
dolins, pedal steel and even an upright

take of “Glitter

bass on several tracks. Costello and
co-producer T-Bone Burnett have

 on t ar e-
laxed and breathe in a way that 1984’s
incredibly cluttered Goodbye Cruel

World did not.

King of America contains 15 songs
and over 57 minutes of simple, yet

    
  
   

breathtaking performances. The roots
of Coste|lo’s work lie at the heart of
several classic rock albums. The
album’s opener, “Brilliant Mistake,”
features a wistful accordion linethat is
reminiscent of the Band’s self-titled
second album. The wordplay,
however, is pure Costello — She said
that she was working for the ABC
news/ It was as much of the alphabet
as she knew how to use. Many of the
other arrangements recall Blonde on

  

B/onde-era Dylan, especially “|’l| Wear
It Proudly” with its gorgeous Ham-
mond organ. -“-Proudly” is addressed
to Coste|lo’s new girlfriend. and is
typical of a new-found directness in his
writing, I hate these flaming curtains,

smwcase, 14.  "

they’re not the color of your hair/ I hate
the buttons on your shirt when alll want
to do is tear.

With this album, his 12th, Costello
offers further proof that he is among
the most versatile vocalists of our time.
He displays a complete range of emo-
tions which includes uncontrolled rage
on “Little Palaces,” a chilling tale of
child abuse in the sedated homes_of
England. When the mood shifts to ut-
ter desperation on Elvis’ remake of
The Animals’ “Don’t Let Me Be
Misunderstood,” his raspy delivery
sounds as if he had smoked a carton
of Camels before recording his vocal
track. Perhaps his best vocal is on ‘‘In-
door Fireworks,” a song about a highly
flammable romance that’s built on a
cleverly extended metaphor. Elvis has
never sounded more sincerely melan-
choly as he promises, Don’t think for
a moment dear that we’ll ever be
through/ I ’l/ build a bonfire of my
dreams/ And burn of broken effigy of
me and you.

King of America is Elvis Coste||o’s
most consistently listenable album and
a convincing argument for his extraor-
dinary talents. It is wonderfully ap-
propriate that the artist proudly wears
a crown because he has regained the
throne among all pop songwriters. The
jacket of Costello's 1977 debut pro-
claimed it best: Elvis is ‘King!

Did Eurogliders make a big impression

Uncomfortable on Radio

DIVINYLS
What A Life
Chrysalis

The Divinyls are part of the breed of
little-known rock bands which boast an
unusual female lead singer (not unlike
Lone Justice) that critics love to rave
about. Their sound is wrecking-ball
rock ‘n’ roll, not quite trashed-up
enough to qualify as heavy metal, and
not quite’comfortab|e enough for the
radio. On WhatA Life, as in the past,
lead singer Christina Amphlett, with
her suicidal stage demeanor, brings to
mind Tina Turner with diarrhea. Or
maybe Wendy 0. Williams on
downers.

Yet Christina Amphlett is the very
backbone of the band; she’s one of the
major reasons the Divinyls are still
churning out fresh music. Her nasal-
fired delivery is full of pain and despair
and the fact she may not be playing
with a full deck suggests that every
song» she sings may be just another
passing phase. She sounds like a
frustrated eighteen-year-old who's just
been grounded for prom night.and
who's retreated to her bedroom for a
good cry.

Indeed, the tantrums behind V“|n My
Life” find Amphlett all caught up in a
web of youthful confusion. Hey, lbeen
in my life, she sings with so much con-
fidence she begins to sound evasive.
/ was born and brought up wrong/And
I don ’t know where lcome from. She’s
tossing out comments on how her life
has been uneventful and disarming,
but it’s not by any means a sad song.

A never-was that always has been, she
continues while knocking the very in-
stitutions she sarcastically admits

never appealed to her: Modeling

Mike Chapman re-mixed WhatA Life
and produced two of the album’s
tracks. Chapman is a master at work-
ing with female artists (from Debbie
Harry to Pat Benatar to Scandal’s Pat-
ty Smyth) and he’s seemingly tapped

the best of what the Divinyls have to
offer in just two songs. “Sleeping
Beauty” echoes the longing felt in find-
ing the right person in life. Still waiting
for my ship to come in/Still waiting for
the right kinda friend, Amphlett sings
in a low soprano that glides into mean-
ingful, touching choruses. And'Hol|y
Knight's “Pleasure and Pain,” co-
written by Chapman, is a fantastical ef-
fort defining’ the relationship of a bat-
tered lover. When Amphlett sings I've

__A Pink Techno-pop Gutter-

PRETTY IN PINK

Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
A&M

Various Artists

The only people I could imagine ac-
tually buying this utterly tame and
disposable piece of plastic are gum-
cracking female teenyboppers who
wear ribbons in their hair, hum the
melody to “Material Girl" on the street
and gawk at Molly Flingwald’s totally
gone digs. Now, I have nothing against
these types. At bus stops when I see
girls in school uniforms I want to 
well, that’s another story.

John Hughes, the film’s writer and
director and master theoretician on
soundtracks and teen garbage,
believes, according to the press
release, the “soundtracks should be
as well thought out as the film itself.”
On the sleevehe pontificates further:
“The music in Pretty in Pink is not an
afterthought.” No? It might as well be.

And what about that sleeve? Pretty
prim packaging, this Pretty in Pink. The
cover is a blatant promo shot of the
three stars all looking quite hep and
serious, with Molly pretty in pink,
flanked by the two geeks plastic in
polyester or whatever’s cool in thrift
shops these days.

On the back are strips of pseudo film
clips showing archetypal scenes from
the film: Molly wolly confused, Molly
wolly poutin’ pretty, Molly wolly happy,
Molly wolly and her B-52ed-up soul
mate in an excruciatingly mod setting,
teen angst at school (two powdered
cretins, one in black, one in white,
toughing it out against some school
lockers) and Molly wolly in the arms of
love. ,

Pretty in Pink is the third of Hughes’
teen trilogy featuring Ringwald. (The
others are Breakfast Club and Sixteen
Candles.) All feature “new music” (a
euphemism for -contemporary would-
be Top 40) soundtracks, new wave
chic and “modern teenage problems.”
Ultimately, they’re all nauseating ex-
ercises in teen stereotyping, especially
The Breakfast Club, whose five teen ar-
chetypes are pat and simplistic beyond
belief. Amidst the banality Hughes
does touch on several real adolescent
problems and hang-ups, but all too
often the relevance gets entangled
with monolithic cliches, rendering the
whole package a relevantly tangled
monolithic cliche. V

_ About the soundtrack. Yes, the
music, Not an afterthought, y’know.
Ten cuts. Ten new music kingpins.
Suzanne Vegals “Left of Center”
(“featuring Joe Jackson on piano”), a
haunting, irresistible rhythmic ode to
oddballism and boy meets wallflower,
is the only decent tune on the whole
album. Other less-than-worthwhile
shards of new music include New
Order’s uncharacteristically weak
“Shell Shock,” which is no shock at
all, The Smiths’ “Please Please
Please Let Me Get What I Want” — to
Paul: Hey, I’m as sensitive as the next
queen, but enough’s enough — and
Echo and the Bunnymen’s “Bring on
the Dancing Horses,” their usual
melodic wimpiness.

Then there’s the title track by the
Psychedelic Furs, an entirely new
recording of their classic. The original
is so much better than this version that
it might make one wonder why they
bothered to record it again. l’ll tell you
why. On the new version, the vocals,
bass and especially the drums are far
more out front in the mix, indicating a
conscious strategy of dance club ac-

cessibility. Meanwhile, the vocal
urgency and slash ‘n’ jangle guitar that
made this such a great song are all but
gone, blown away in the strong wind
of Hollywood/disco pandering. I don’t
really like the words sell out (Hey, like
I always say, ‘‘I’m willing to sell out, on-
ly no one’s buying.”), but what do
these once-proud standard bearers of
post-punkdom care about coddled
Hollywood tarts who missed the long-
gone new wave omnibus? We know
what they care about.

The remaining tracks on this banal
vinyl are truly unmemorable, pretty
sludge from faceless anti-titans of the
proverbial techno-pop gutter.

On the whole there’s nothing hard,
raw, adventurous or interesting about
this insipid attempt at thematic
coherence vis-a-vis the film. Maybe it’s
not a total loss, though. College-bound
Molly could use it as the soundtrack for
an Ivy League orgy/slumber party
featuring appearances by Brooke and
Jody, with multiple video screens
playing Blue Lagoon, Pretty Baby, The
Hotel New Hampshire and of course
Molly’s teen epics.

Loverboy. Even ‘‘All You Zombies,”
which many in the biz see as a happy
marriage of post-punk social con-

sciousness with basic Rock sen-
sibilities, fails from too many com-

ilk, The Hooters offer too much gloss
and not enough guts. C

Mental as Anything: Live It Up

A peppy, happy fluff of a song, pure
pop in the Squeeze tradition. Mental
as Anything will never hit it big in
America —- we like our pop banalities
to be heavy and serious in their mean-
inglessness, rather than light and
ironic, which is more honest — but
then, this innocent troupe of Aussie
minstrels wouldn’t know what to do
with major success if they had it. It's
strange — a band like this would never
be missed if they faded away or broke
up, but it’s somehow reassuring to
know that there are some people who
are happy just to make fun, unob-
trusive music. These guys would never
start a war. (Boy, am I getting
sentimental.)

been standing at the back of your
life/Back row centre just above the ice,
she's asking you to listen to the
beating of her breaking heart.

That's another reasonwhy What A
Life is an invigorating effort by the
Divinyls. Christina Amphlett has
matured to the point where she’s in-
viting us to share her emotions and
frustrations rather than merely asking
us to sit and listen. “Dear Diary” is a
heartbreaking example. It begins like
a ballad — Dear diary, l’m lonely/Won ’t
you send someone to hold me — sud-
denly blusters into a song, and ends
as if Amphlett has purposely dragged
us through one of her worst
nightmares — The fairground sky is
empty and chil/ed/T he grass is white in
squares and black where oil has
spilled. The repetition at the end of the
song of We all run after a dream in life
and See how she runs is heavy-
hearted and melancholy, yet somehow
wonderfully upbeat.

Amphlett has the magic in her voice
to make all of this work, but the rest of

 

several times in the process. The
scenes between them have some
flare, in a funny sense rather than
romantic.

But despite everyone’s disapproval,
one person is on Molly’s side: her
sister and fellow school teacher
Verona (Swoossie Kurtz). She takes
the kids and the dog turned wildcat (he
plays the mascot as well) to each and
every game. Other appearances in-
clude Nipsy Russell as Central’s
easygoing principal and Mykel
Williamson who plays officer Ronnie
Darfield on Hill Street Blues. William-
son is Levander “Bird” Williams, the
star quarterback who gets blackmailed
into playing by Coach McGrath.

the band members deserve just as
much credit. Mark McEntee’s key-
boards and guitar on “Sleeping Beau-
ty” are outstanding, guitarwork from
Bjarne Ohlin and bass by Rick
Grossman motivate the hard rock in-
telligence behind delicious offerings
like “Casual Encounter” and “Good
Die Young” and Richard Harvey plays
the drums as if he’s chopping
firewood.

Past efforts from the Divinyls proved
they had the raw talent to emerge on-
to the music scene with the ex-
plosiveness and fanfare they deserve,
but what WhatA Life achieves is a re-
affirmation of sorts. When this band
calms itself down, as it does many
times on What A Life, and when the
smoke begins to clear, the Divinyls
may find themselves standing forefront
on the road to success. There are

things inside things/T hat can ’t be .

denied, Christina Amphlett sings with
an air of obscurity. What A Life
unleashes Amphlett from a cage she’s
been in for a long time, and proves
she's ready to conquer anything.

ever fulfilling their fantasy.

in one sense, the characters of
Brazil are somewhat predetermined.
This may account for the underdevel-
opment of Jill. She is in essence little
more than the object of Sam’s deci-
sively male fantasies. Explicit phallic
imagery and the British/Benny Hill
bosom slurs will not excite any remote-
ly feminist viewers. Jill even puts on a
wig of flowing blonde hair and a see-
through negligee to conform to Sam’s
predictable vision of the femme fatale.

Ida, however, is a much more
successfully developed character. She
is a woman consumed by the desire for
artificial youth and the other banalities
of ruling-class life. For Helmond, it is
a small step from her role as Jessica
Tate in the TV series Soap. Equally
successful is Sam’s pitiful boss, Kurtz-

-man, played by Ian Holme. Ho|me’s

skillful portrayal of the lip-quivering and
ever-anxious bureaucrat shows what
Kim Greist might have been able to do
with her own role, had it been of thicker
quality. But, to reiterate, she was con-
strained in being little more than the
object of Sam’s desire throughout the
film.

backdrops. With their new epony-
mously-titled mini-LP, the band, now a
foursome, shows signs of brightening
its outlook somewhat, yet still seems
to revert to cynicism all too often.

The dramatic, acoustic guitar-
dominated “Faint Hearts,” repeated
here from Virgins, aptly demonstrates
the band’s mysterious compositions.
The song is at once tense and lovely,
accusatory, but moving. “Armchair
Theatre,” too, seems a quandary as
Spanish-sounding horns and airy
female voices help to musically detail
a bleak modern world that singer Terry
Hall wants to escape from. The richly
textured “Frosty Morning” more overt-
ly resorts to pessimism, looking critical-

ly at finding something to believe in. .

Thanks to Gilliam’s sophisticated

and clear, soft synthesizer add to the
happy mood. Still, coming out of the
blue like this, one wonders how
serious Hall is that it’s time to smile.

Two live tracks add to the confusion.
The clean, open sound of “Pushing Up
Daisies” breathes more life into the
song than its original psychedelic
studio rendering, and a sense of fun
enters. when Hall begins to laugh
periodically throughout the tune. His
chuckles sound woefully out of place,
however, on the otherwise pretty and
convincing tale of heartbreak and
misery, “Yours Sincerely.”

Hall and songwriting collaborator
Toby Lyons have created unique, com-
pelling musical arrangements once
more on The Colour Field’s mini-LP —
all six songs blend together well
musically. it’s the lyrics, however, that
make one wish The Colour Field would
just detail their black vision and quit
being so annoyingly coy.

Showcase, March 14," 1986

By Shaun Martin

On the north shore of Lake Ontario,
just a stone’s throw from grimy Buffalo

. and seedy Niagara Falls, is Toronto, a

sparkling clean and teeming metrop-
olis of 2.5 million. In addition to serv-
ing as the capital of Ontario, it is also
Canada’s center for business and fi-
nance. Although it is the hub for the
country’s English-speaking population,
it has about 500,000 Italians, the con-
tinent’s largest Portuguese communi-
ty, and a Chinatown second only to
San Francisco's in both size and at-
mosphere. This cosmopolitan city is a
must for anyone who loves to travel but
is on a limited budget.

Getting There‘

Toronto is only six hours from Pitts-
burgh by car; however, if you are driv-
ing in the winter, be sure to check
highway conditions. You’ll be driving
through the treacherous Lake Ontario
snow belt. If you have less time and a
little money, flying is your best bet.
Round trip airfare is only $94 on Nord-
air, and flying time is less than 45
minutes!

Culture Shock

Although culturally Toronto is not
much different from most North
American cities, we often forget that it
is in a foreign country and there are
minor differences which confront the
unsuspecting tourist from the United
States. The Canadian dollar is worth
about 70 cents so if prices seem a bit
high, they’re probably not. Prices are
not the only confusing thing, though
the money itself can cause problems.
Each denomination -— $1, $2, $5, etc.
— is a different color and one must pay
special attention to this when spending
one’s money.

The drinking age in Toronto is only
19, but alcohol is only served until 1:00
a.m. and all glassware must be off the
table by 1:45. If you’re not done drink-

é'b-bvbd-6.-'5.~v£~«&~'.b'bvb¢£~vbv£~'b'£-iirbvbvbé-vb‘!-é-'1--£-*'&~&~é -1"!-

ing, too bad! A friendly waiter will come
up to you and snatch your drink from
under your nose.

Only stores in designated tourist
areas, such as Chinatown, are permit-
ted to operate on Sundays, otherwise
the entire city shuts down.

taste for haute couture, try the

like Parachute. If you find yourself low

in the garment district, but don’t expect
to find anything great.

_ Copa’s position of the “in” place to go.

Shopping

Eaton Centre is a huge shopping
complex under glass in the heart of
downtown Toronto. Three levels of
stores, restaurants and a 17-movie
cinema make up this shopper’s
paradise. At the end of the mall is
Eaton’s six-story department store.
However, the stores here are some-
what disappointing. There’s not much
here that you couldn't find elsewhere.

After you paid your obligatory visit to
this shopping palace, head for Queen
Street where you'll find a much more
innovative shopping area. The many

small, local. designer shops and vin- -

tage clothing stores make it easy to
walk away an afternoon and a wa||et’s
wealth. Try Pablo and Monterey, two
adjacent and independent clothing
shops that offer a small but great
selection of clothing. They're located
upstairs in an unmarked building at

Before you venture out to sample
Toronto’s nightlife, you must pick up
a NOW magazine, the city’s free enter-
tainment guide. You can_ find them
anywhere. If you’re only spending
three nights in Toronto, then here are
the three clubs to visit. Nuts and Bolts,
located at 277 Victoria Street, is open
Monday through Saturday and offers
mostly new-wave dance music. Cover
is $4, and the club stays open until
4:00 a.m. on weekends. The hottest
club in Toronto now is the Copa at
Yorkville and Yonge Streets. The
music ranges from new wave to
pop/disco, and the people are very
friendly. One great feature of the Copa
is its nightly buffet; the food is excellent
for the $3-$6 cover that you pay,
though drinks are a bit on the expen-
sive side.

Tourist Traps

Every city has its attractions that un- '

justly sponge tourist dollars, but Toron-
to doesn’t seem to have many. Per-

— haps the most well known is the CN

Tower, the world's tallest free-standing
structure: 1,815 feet, 5 inches. Getting
to the observation deck, complete with
restaurant and night club, costs $5.
Going any higher will be an additional
$1. The other must-see is Casa Loma,
the 98-room palace built by Sir Henry
Pellatt between 1909 and 1913. For a

obstacle is soon overcome by going in

I love pizza, but sometimes I grow tired
of it. if variety is indeed the spice of life,
why not try some excellent, prepared
to order healthful Chinese food for a
change? Genghis Cones delivers to an
area extending from downtown, along
the river to Lawrenceville, up to
Wilkinsburg and as far away as this
side of the High Level Bridge.
Delivery time is less than 45 minutes
after the order is placed and prices, ex-
cluding tip, are generally up to 35 per-
cent less than the same or similar
items in a sit-down restaurant. Try one
of the box lunches for $3.25 that come
with a hefty-portioned main course
such as roast pork with broccoli, hot
and spicy chicken or pepper steak, ac-
companied by a marinated chicken
wing, fried wonton, half an egg roll and

with an earring caused many mothers
to shade their little boys’. eyes. It
seems, however, that those days have
passed. What used to be a social
stigma has now been accepted by a
large part of a society that had a hard
time accepting women in pants.

Take a look at some of the biggest
lobes in show business. The immortal
Bruce Springsteen, dancer extraor-
dinaire Gregory Hines, half of TV’s hot-
test dynamic duo, Phillip Michael
Thomas, English heartthrob George

pressure cooker-like device and
served with a soy, honey and tomato
sauce for $6.25. Short rib lovers might
like to try the Korean Ribs (four for
$3.50, six for $4.75, eight for $6.25),
tender cross-cut beef ribs, marinated
in soy, ginger and garlic and charcoal
grilled to a juicy succulence.

An unusual dish that we especially
liked was the Chicken Cold Noodles
($4.95) -— cooked egg noodle, cooled,
then mixed with a spicy hot peanut
sauce, garnished with chicken chunks,
snow peas and bean sprouts. The dish
comfortably feeds two, even three,
depending on your appetite;
vegetables or shrimp may be
substituted for the chicken with an ap-
propriate adjustment in price.

Another dish you might like to try is
the Mu Shu (vegetable, chicken, pork,
beef or shrimp). We opted for Mu Shu
Pork ($5.75). This is a build-it-yourself
dish. Just take one of the four Chinese
crepes, spread some plum sauce over
it, put as many green onions on it as
you like, spoon the cooked pork
vegetable mixture over the crepe, fold
into cylinder, and eat with your hands.

method of identification, but no longer.
So what does an earring in a guy’s ear
mean then? It means no more than
any other part of his attire. It means
that he chooses to wear an earring.
I think it’s great that a guy can now
wear an earring if he so chooses, but,
as with other matters of fashion, there
are some guidelines to follow. First of
all, get your ear pierced professional-
ly. They become infected very easily.
Second, show great style. Don’t wear
some wild-looking thing that makes
you look radical. It should accent, not
obscure. Finally, know when to wear
it. Sure, many people don’t mind men
with an earring. Some even like it.
Others like it a lot. However, a job in-
terview is not a great place to show

something in common.

Another point to consider is that a
guy wearing an earring isn’t a new or
uncommon thing. lt’s just that his au-
dience will probably lift him from the
category- of social outcast to that of a
fashion connoisseur. -That’s why many
of the models appearing in GO, MGF,

something new. Try something a little

The Pitt News, March 14, 1985

Pitt needs proven big-time coach

“We are not afraid to challenge
someone defensively.”

Those were the words of Southwest ’

Missouri State Sports ‘Information
Director Mark Stillwell on Tuesday
afternoon as he attempted to convince
this writer that his team actually had
a chance against Pitt. “We are known
for our defense,” Stillwell persisted.
Yeah, right!

You cannot score if you don’t get a
shot off. Pitt could only put 52 points
on the board after averaging over 77
points per game throughout the regular
season. The result is an appropriate
ending to a disappointing season.

I had a feeling the Panthers were in
trouble when I saw Chipman on the
news Tuesday night. He was asked if
he thought the Panthers were deserv-
ing of an NIT bid.

Jim Urban

Well, here we are three days later
and Pitt has been eliminated from‘ the
National Invitational Tournament via
a 59-52 loss to that same Southwest
Missouri Stateteam.

When you put two teams together on
a playground, the team that » plays
defense is usually going to win. If you
stop your opponent from scoring, you
will win. Well, that is what happened
on Wednesday night, as Southwest
Missouri State forced the Panthers in-
to committing 27 turnovers. As a team,
Southwest Missouri State had 15 steals.
They played defense.

“Well, there are 64 teams in the
NCAA and 32 in the NIT. That has to
add up to close to 90 teams. I don’t
think there are 90 better teams in the

nation than us,” Chipman replied.

Let’s see, 64 plus 32  carry the one
. whatever?

Regardless, the task at hand is selec-
ting Chipman’s replacement. Pitt must
find a man who is able to control the
different personalities on the talented
Pitt squad.

“It is so much harder to coach
talented players because they tend to
want to express themselves,” said
Georgetown’s John Thompson. “The
less talented player is more apt to listen
and play within the system.”

Navy coach Paul Evans was in town '

on Tuesday interviewing for the job.
Cleveland Cavalier head coach George
Karl was interviewed yesterday, but
rumor has it that he wants too much
money. Pitt will have’to spend the
bucks if it ever wants to reach the big
time.

Nothing against Evans, but he
coaches at the Naval Academy, where
control and discipline are givens. One

A has to wonder how he could do with

a talented team. When Chipman was
in the Eastern 8, the Panthers had
talented squads, but nothing that ap-
proached what they have now. Chip-
man was a good coach in the Eastern
8 and did a decent job in Pitt’s early
Big East years. When he got the talent,
however, he could not produce. One
has to wonder if the same would hold
true for Paul Evans. He has his team
in the NCAA Tournament, but he is
coaching probably the most disciplined
group of players in the nation. Pitt’s
players are not disciplined. I really
believe if Chipman was coaching at
Navy, he could have paralleled Evans’
accomplishments. Let’s just hope that
Evans doesn’t parallel Chipman’s
accomplishments.

 

Pitt’s Curtis Aiken, Keith Armstrong and Dmere Gore all had oiible

overs, and the Panthers lost to Southwest Missouri State, 59-52.

Chaz Palla/The Putt News

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer
Eric Canon, Joe Daniels, Tim

Manes, Lee McRae, Dave Morre and
Bob Weiner ~— six of Pitt’s premier

athletes —— left on Wednesday evening

to participate in the NCAA Track and
Field Championships in Oklahoma
City, Okla. So far this year there have
only been two other men who have
qualified for the NCAAs in any other
sport here at Pitt. That fact makes track
the sport which has produced the most
athletes who have earned the right to
compete with this nation’s best.

Pitt will be sending six athletes to an
event that is probably as hard as or
harder than any other collegiate com-
petition held on the national or any
other level when it comes to qualify-
ing. “Sixty—four teams go to the
NCAA Basketball Tournament, but on-
ly the top 20 people in each event and
the top 10 relays qualify for this meet,”
said Coach John Vasvary of the meet.

Of the six, the one who has been the
most visible, and probably the most
consistent performer, is Lee McRae.
In the 55-meter dash, he has beaten the
best in the nation, and possibly the
world, so far this year. He won the Na-
tional Championship two weeks ago by
beating Sam Gratty, the Olympic Silver
medalist. Prior to that, he had beaten
Carl Lewis and the Olympic bronze
medalist at the Olympic Invitational at
the Meadowlands in New Jersey.
McRae was sixth at the NCAAs last
year and was named an All-America.

Eric Cannon will be the only other
person competing on ‘an individual

level. Running the 55—meter hurdles,
he has made quite a name for himself
this year. As a freshman, he was sec-
ond in the Big East, losing by less than
a step, while competing in the 55-meter
dash at the same meet. Going into the
meet, there has been only a small group
of hurdlers who have qualified, and
among those, Cannon has one of the
better qualifying times. As long as the
inexperience of a meet as big and
prestigious as this does not affect him
adversely, Cannon should do well.

The remaining four —~ Joe Daniels,
Tim Manes, Dave Moore and Bob
Weiner —— compose Pitt’s two-mile
relay team. They had qualified for the
Nationals in January, but shortly after
that‘ Tim Manes suffered a badly
sprained ankle and did not return until
last week. The team did well in his
absence but was not overpowering.
Upon his return. they were able to win
the lC4As. To this point, the relay has
not been severely tested, and neither
has Manes’ ankle. Vasvary feels that
at the moment, this may be their
weakness, “They have not really been
together as a whole group and, up to
this point, have not had the chance to
run fast.”

All six of them should do well
because they are among the elite of the
elite. What makes them even more im-
pressive is that there is not one senior
in the whole group. Even if they do not
do that well and come back without
winning anything, they have nothing to
be ashamed of because they qualiﬁed
for an event that only a true winner can
compete in. “The fact that they have
even qualiﬁed says a lot right there,”
said Vasvary.

The Pitt News, March 14, 1985

By Jim Brueckner

Hearns: The ‘ ‘Hit Man’ ’ returns

The majority of attention Monday
night was focused on the ﬁght between
Marvelous Marvin Hagler and John
“The Beast” Mugabi for the un-
disputed middleweight championship
of the world. However, there were two
other title ﬁghts that night that provided
just as much excitement.

In the first featured event of the even-
ing, champion Richie Sandoval squared
off against No. 1 ranked contender
Gaby Canizales for the WBA bantam-
weight championship of the world.
While it’s true that boxing is plagued
with the problem of having more than
one champ in most divisions, a majori-
ty of boxing people have considered
Sandoval to be the “true” champion
ever since he wrestled the title from
long-time champ Jeff Chandler.

Sandoval entered the fight
undefeated in 29 bouts, with 17
knockouts to his credit. Canizales
sported an impressive 32-2 mark with
26 KOs. It promised to be an action-
filled fight.

Round 1: As the fight opens, it is
easy to note Canizales’ strong facial
resemblance to the legendary Roberto
Duran. He begins to show a fighting
style similar to Duran’s as he is

perpetually active, far more active than

Sandoval. Canizales attacks to the
body and continually follows this up

with straight rights that are landing with

surprising success. Sandoval is hurt,

and a series of left and right hooks

drops the champion to the canvas. But

it is late in the round, and he is able
to rise and hold on until the bell.

Round 2: Canizales opens in the
same active fashion. He throws
punches relentlessly. A quick left hook
staggers Sandoval. Canizales begins
mixing straight rights with uppercuts.
He is still attacking Sandoval’s body.
One month ago, Sandoval was 10 lbs.
heavier. This kind of weight loss is not
good for a lower weight class fighter.
Canizales’ body punching is visibly
weakening the champion.

Round 3: Sandoval has a bruise
under his left eye. He is keeping away
from Canizales, trying to figure him
out. With one minute left in the round,
Canizales begins landing effective com-
binations. Just before the end of the
round, he lands two left jabs, a straight
right and two stiff hooks.

Round 4: This is the most unevent-
ful round of the fight. Canizales has
thrown a lot of punches. He is catching
his second win. Sandoval lands a few
jabs, but it is interesting to note that he

has not yet even thrown a meaningful
right.

Round 5: 30 seconds into the round,
Canizales is once again throwing pun-
ches at a furious pace. He lands two
powerful left hooks in a multi-punch
ﬂurry. Sandoval has been getting
pounded, but shows heart. Canizales is
relentless and ﬁnally drops Sandoval
again. He rises, only to be rocked by
a series of overhand rights. Canizales
has him pinned on the ropes, but aban-
dons his previously effective body at-
tack and unsuccessfully headhunts in
pursuit of the knockout. This change
in strategy backﬁres as Sandoval comes
back off the ropes and snaps the head
of Canizales with two straight rights.

Round 6: Both men show respect for
one another; Canizales has a cut over
his right eye. It is in a bad position, just
underneath the eyebrow. Sandoval
scores with a brief ﬂurry and wins the
round withhis ring generalship.

Round 7: Canizales opens the round

by landing a few jabs. Sandoval seems-

unaffected and appears to be gaining
confidence until a booming right hand
drops him to the floor. Sandoval is
stunned. .He regains his feet, only to
walk straight into a left hook that sends

The Pitt News, March 14, 1985

Rovee addicted to gymnastics

By Shelly Ramus
Staff Writer

The fabric of a sports legend is
woven with tales of the underdog. He
is an athlete who spent hours in the gym
after everyone else had long since
gone, someone who gave his heart and
soul when he had nothing else to give.

Ben Rovee knows the feeling of be-
ing an underdog, of being too small and
too short, of striving to make up with
determination what he lacked in
physical ability.

Rovee is a coach’s dream. He eats,
sleeps and lives gymnastics. As a
result, he has become an important
member of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s men’s gymnastics team. No
one appreciates Rovee‘s dedication
more — or is quicker to draw attention

to it — than Pitt coach Frank D’Amico.

“Ben is the type of person you would
want as a son," D’Amico said. “He
deserves a medal for his performance
against Kent State. His routines have
been very good, and he is constantly
working to improve them.”

The dedication to his sport doesn’t
end when Rovee leaves the gym. In the
few spare moments he has between
workouts and classes, Rovee is still
thinking gymnastics. He reads every-
thing he can about his sport, in the
rulebook or in the latest gymnastics
magazine, with one thought in mind —
to be the best gymnast he can.

“When I have some extra time, Ilike
to think about my routines and what I
can do to improve them,” Rovee said.
“A lot of times I’ll read through the
new rule book or gymnastics magazine,
trying to ﬁnd new tricks to use in my
routines.”

Rovee’s road to Pitt started with his
freshman year at Hunterdon Central.
In his hometown of Flemington, N.J . ,

gymnastics was considered a fall sport.

To keep in shape and improve his tech-
nique, Rovee travelled to a private gym
during the off-season. The hard work
and determination paid off when he
ﬁnished first on the rings in United
States Gymnastics Foundation (USGF)
competition and second in the same
event in state high school champion-
ships his senior year. Rovee also fin-
ished fourth at the state competition in
the all-around.

“You might say that in my sopho-
more year I saw the light,” Rovee said
with a smile. “Not competing very
much as a freshman was tough, and my
desire to work hard seemed to fade.
Then things changed the next year. I
decided to get serious and work hard
on my routines. I listened and learned
as much as I could from Frank and the
other guys on the team.

“I had a hard time getting used to
Frank’s style at ﬁrst. My old coach was
an ex—Marine who yelled and carried
a stick. Not having Frank yell at me
took some getting used to. I have

learned a lot from him, though, and he
has really helped me improve my
technique."

For the Panthers, Rovee is more than
just a solid gymnast. His spirit and en-
thusiasm make him the motivator for
the team. When a teammate completes
a routine, good or bad, Rovee is the
first person to shake his hand and tell
him he did a good job.

“I really get into the meet,” Rovee
commented. “I like to get everyone
psyched up and ready to compete.
Whether they do a great routine or a
poor one, I always try to go out and
encourage them. If someone fell eight
times, I tell them it was OK because
they didn't fall nine times.

“I would really like to coach gym-
nastics after I graduate. I'd like to stay
involved with gymnastics and help
other kids improve on their routines.
Coaching gives you a sense of satisfac-
tion. You have to learn new tricks and
then teach them to someone else. When
that person completes the move then
both of you have been successful.“

The Pitt News, March l4,

him right back down. On the way
down, Sandoval smacks his head on the
canvas and is in no shape to continue.
His instincts get him back on his feet,
and referee Carlos Padilla foolishly
allows him to ﬁght. Sandoval is pep-
pered with four devastating hooks.
Finally, a right uppercut sends him
down and literally out. Sandoval did
not regain consciousness until much
later in the hospital. Thankfully, he was
said to “appear OK.”

At 2:47 of the seventh round, Gaby
Canizales became the new WBA ban-
tamweight champion. His first thoughts
after winning the title were of genuine
concern for his game opponent.

It should be noted that the sport of
boxing was not at fault for Sandover’s
injuries, it was the poor judgement of
referee Carlos Padilla.

Nothing could have saved James
Shuler from Thomas Hearns. As the

two men took to the ring in the fight

for Shuler"s North American mid-

dleweight title, everyone wondered if
I-learns could ever recover from the
loss to Hagler.

Round 1: As the two men come
together, Heams is the more active of
the two. He is going to the body and
coming upstairs with straight rights. the
left jab is measuring Shuler. Out of
nowhere, Hearns lets ﬂy a thunderous
overhand right that lands right on the
button! The punch was reminiscent of
the exact punch that Heams used to KO
Duran. Shuler is unconscious before he
hits the canvas. However, he regains
consciousness a minute later and comes
over to congratulate Hearns.

At 1:13 of the first round, Heams has
won the NABF middleweight title and,
more importantly, an almost definite
rematch with Hagler.

This fight was supposed to show
whether or not Heams could hurt a full-

fledged middleweight. Shuler has
always had a solid chin. He was an
outstanding amateur and was con-
sidered to be a legitimate threat to
Hagler’s title. Can Hearns punch with
the middleweight? You’d better believe
it! -

In this fight, he was “The Hit
Man!!” -

Before Monday night, Hagler had I

verbally agreed to grant Heams a
rematch if both men emerged vic-
torious. (Remember, Hearns broke his
hand in the first round of his ﬁght with
Hagler.) But at the press conference
following the fights, Hagler backed off
and said that nothing was ﬁnal. He said
that it would be “considered.” Did
Heams’ savage knockout have anything
to do with this sudden change of plans!

It was more than a night of Hagler
vs. Mugabi. The bantamweights have
a new king, and “The, Hit Man” is
back!

“ The Pitt News, March 14, 1985 ‘

Choosing a ong distance
company is a lot like choosing .
a roommate.  

    It’s better to kno what they’re 
like before you move in.

©AT&T 1986

Living with someone for the ﬁrst time can be an
“educational” experience. a

And living with a long distance company isn’t any
different. Because some companies may not give you
all the services you’re used to getting from AT&T.

For instance, with some companies you have to
spend a certain amount before you qualify for their
special volume discounts. With some others, voice
quality may vary.

But when you choose AT&T, there won’t be any
surprises when you move in. You’ll get the same high-
quality, trouble-free service you’re used to.

With calls that sound as close as next door. And
discounts off our Day Rate on your state—to—state calls.

llllll

With savingsof over 50% during weekends until 5pm
Sundays, or nights from 11pm to 8am, Sunday through
Friday. And 40% discounts evenings between 5pm and
11pm, Sunday through Friday _ .

With AT&T, you’ll continue to get services like im
mediate credit for wrong numbers and collect calling.
And long distance operators to help you anytime there's
a problem on the line.

So when you’re asked to choose a long distance com-

pany, choose AT&T. Because whether you’re into Mozart

or metal, quality is the one thing everyone can agree
on. Call 1 800 222-0300 for more information or to
choose AT&T.

Reach out and touch someone?

AT&T

The right choice.
