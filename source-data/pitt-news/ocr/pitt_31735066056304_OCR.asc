United States leads coalition
air strike against Iraqi targets

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

At 1:15 p.m. EST Wednesday, U.S.
warplanes from the aircraft carrier
USS Kittyhawk led a coalition force
on a limited air strike into southern
Iraq.

It was almost two years to the day
that the United States launched a
full-scale attack that was to become
known as the Persian Gulf War. This
time, however, the attack was con-
cise and over in just a few hours.

The attack was planned to enforce
the resolutions made by the U.N.
Security Council — resolutions
which have been repeatedly broken
by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
within the past three weeks. '

“At 1:15 p.m., the United States
and its coalition forces took forceful
actions against Iraq,” White House

spokesperson Marlin Fitzwater said.

Fitzwater said that the intended
attack was targeted at anti—aircraft
batteries and command communica-
tion centers around the 32nd parallel
in Iraq (the southern boundary of
the no-fly zone established by the
United Nations).

The planes involved were from‘ the
United States, Britain and France.
British Tornadoes and French
Mirages were foreign planes used in
the U.S.-led assault.

“The government of Iraq should
understand that we stand ready to
take additional forceful actions if
Iraq denies its obligations again,”
Fitzwater said.

These obligations Fitzwater spoke
of were disregarded by Iraqseveral
times in the last week. At least four,
possibly 12, Iraqi incursions into
Kuwait have led to the taking of

Medical school putting first-year students out in the practice field

By Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

Robert Ramsey was overwhelmed by
the many hospitals in Oakland his
first day at Pitt’s Medical School.

The University of California-Berkely
graduate made his way up the hill to

. Scaife Hall that morning. He passed

Magee \Vomen’s Hospital, Falk Clinic,
Montefiore and Presbyterian.

“Oh my God, what is this place?” he
said to himself as if he had stumbled
onto the hospital capital of the world. -

At that time last year, Ramsey would
have to wait until his third year in
school to get out of classrooms and
into one of those hospitals.

After failing a few classes that
semester Ramsey took a leave of
absence. He came back to Pitt this
past fall to find a dramatically new
curriculum —— and the -chance to work
with patients in his first year of
Medical School.

Instead of keeping the students
tucked away in classrooms for the first

two years studying the basic sciences,»

“[The new system] introduces patient-
care activities from day one,” said Dr.
Sheldon Adler, senior associate dean
of the Medical School.

Ramsey said his first attempt at Pitt
Med" School overwhelmed him. He

would sit among a sea of students dur-
ing four straight hours of lecture. In
hissecond time around, Ramsey found
his lecture courses cut from four ‘hours
to two, and a new class consisting of
only nine students instead of the
expected 150..

In one of these new classes,
Problem-based Learning, the instructor
gives a daily topic — for example, dia-
betes, Ramsey ‘explained. The students
are then given a case, for instance, a
29-year-old woman with obesity and a
history of alcoholism, who the stu-
dents pretend is their patient.

Students are given a certain amount
of research time. Then each student
presents ‘what research methods
should be used to treat the patient.

The difference between the old cur-
riculum and the new was summed up
by first-year student Dan Kowals who,
like Ramsey, started the old system,
dropped out for a semester, and later
returned with the new.

“You’re given a patient instead of a
book,” Kowals said.

Under the traditional curriculum, the
first two years of the students’ educa-

tion were devoted to the basic sci-'

ences such as anatomy, cell biology
and immunology. It was not until their
third year that students began the clin-
ical medicine stage, where they begin

to diagnose and treat actual patients.

“[The new curriculum] breaks the
false separation between the basic sci-
ences and clinical practice,” Adler said.

The course Ambulatory Care sends
the students into a community their
first year. Each student is assigned to
either a physician’s office.‘ health care
center, geriatrics center or a homeless
shelter clinic where he or she spends
two afternoons a week working with
patients.

Another new course, which helps tie
together the student’s basic science
knowledge as well as social skills,
involves a mock interview of a student
“doctor” and a “patient.” In this
course, the student learns how to illicit
the “history” of a patient and to ask
difficult questions. These questions
may include the patient’s diet, trans-
portation and sex life.

Part of the reason for the new cur-
riculum is to produce future doctors
who not only know physiology, anato-
my and cell biology but also can
understand a patient’s social problems,
like whether or not he or she has
enough money to buy the prescrip-
tion.

“You need to know basic sciences as
well as caring, personal interaction, to
be a good doctor,” Adler said.

Under the new curriculum entitled

“P.I.T.T., Physicians in 2000,” Pitt. has
become one of only about 60 schools
in the country that have adopted new
ways of teaching medical students.

The initiative for the changes began
five years ago when members of the
faculty expressed the need for revi-
sions to the traditional educational sys-
tem.

The administration, according to
Adler, then organized task forces made
up of students and faculty who came

up with a proposal for the
changes. The proposal was
approved in September 1991 by

faculty, administration and students.

In the fall of 1992 the proposal went
into practice, using other schools, like
Harvard, Case Western Reserve and
the University of Washington, as
examples, Adler said.

Adler said the new curriculum will‘

“enhance Pitt’s national image and
standing and make Pitt more competi-
tive.” I A

Pitt’s Med School applications have
doubled in the two years since the
program began, Adler said, though he
could not say the new curriculum was
the only reason for the increased inter-
est.

Dr. Richard Stimen, an associate pro-

.fessor of medicine at Pitt, called the

program a “dramatic step to sensitize

Seminars to be held
on marathon running

By_David Weimer
Staff Writer ‘

Students now can learn
how to run in the cold
for free.

A series of five free
seminars is being offered
by Pitt’s Sports Medicine
Institute to help student
runners get ready forithe
Giant Eagle/City of
Pittsburgh Marathon and
10K event in May.

The first seminar will

' be held this Saturday in

Lecture Room 6 at Scaife
Hall.

Larry_ Grollman, the
operations manager
for the marathon’s med-
ical team, will discuss
precautions for training
in cold weather.
Grollman said that the
runners preparing for the
marathon should know
how to handle environ-
mental illnesses such as
frostbite and hypother-
mia. ,

Dr. Paul Thompson, the
director of preventive
cardiology at Pitt’s Heart
Institute, will talk about
training guidelines for
beginning marathon run-

ners, as well as the
importance of medical
screening before training
for a marathon.

Leslie Bonci, a regis-
tered dietician at the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, will dis-
cuss nutritional consider-
ations during marathon
training.

“The major thing is, for
people already running,
that perhaps we can
answer some questions

they may have about

training or if th_ey’ve run
into injuries before,”
Grollman said. “And for
those who have never
run a marathon before,
we want to prevent
injuries and make it a
positive experience for
them.”

Grollman said that the
seminars will provide
information for anyone
interested in endurance
activities such as running
or walking. After the
seminar, Thompson will
lead a 5K Fun Run
through Schenley Park “to
kind of kick off the idea
of a marathon,” Grollman
said.

Affirmative Action distributing new

brochures on barassrnent, diversity ,

By Jennifer N. Spagnuolo
Copy Editor

The Office of Affirmative Action at Pitt
will be providing brochures on combatting
sexual harassment, discrimination based on
sexual orientation andenhancing equal
opportunity, human dignity and racial, eth-
nic and cultural diversity to Pitt students
living on campus, deans and department
heads.

The office opened in 1970 because
of a mandate issued by the presidential
executive order under Lyndon Johnson in
1965. All institutions that have federal con-
tracts of $50,000 or more must have an
affirmative action office. Therefore, most
universities, private or public, will have
one.

William A. Savage, assistant to‘ the
chancellor and director of Affirmative
Action, has been here at Pitt since July of
1991. He described the office as one that is
taking a “proactive affirmative action
approach.” Savage says that he won’t- just
sit back and listen to complaints, he and
Affirmative Action’s Assistant Director
Elaine Frampton will tackle projects on
their own.

Together they conduct studies and under-
take research projects on the analyses of
employment, student program participation
and graduate school enrollment.

Frampton and Savage found
minorities at Pitt are underrepresented in
student programs; and as faculty, women
are underrepresented in senior administra-
tive positions, and tenured professorial
positions; female students are underrepre-

that~

sented in graduate programs in non-tradi-
tional areas like engineering, science and
math. '

The types of harassment that the office
handles are internal complaints of intimida-
tion and threats with racial, ethnic or
sexual orientation connotations. But,
as one brochure states, the university can-
not do this alone: “The campus community
contributes to the University’s commitment
to affirmative action through the work
of senior administrative officers,
deans, directors, department heads,
managers, supervisors and various
campus-wide, school, departmental,
and student committees and groups as
well as individual faculty, staff and stu-
dents.” ‘

Frampton, who takes complaints, said that
she handled approximately 60 complaints’
between June of 1991 and July of 1992. A
student with a complaint may put it in writ-
ing or come in personally.

Frampton then contacts the party accused
to inform him or her of’ the complaint
and conducts an investigation by studying
documents and interviewing parties
involved. She then reviews the information
to check for sufficient evidence to
support the allegation. After that she said
she reccomends sanctions for the person to
take.

The new packet of brochures the office is
producing will be used in Teaching
Assistant orientation and staff orientation
for their training in education.

In addition to the new brochures, Pitt has
recently adopted an anti-harassment policy.

Protest

Continued from page 1

About 40 students from Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon
University, as well as adults
and young people not affiliat-
ed with either university,
took part in the protest.

Bush said that the raids
were not needed and that the
president had no business to
bomb Iraq.

“It is maddening to
know that Pitt Students for

Peace is still organized, we‘

are on the eve of another big
war,” she said.
President-elect Bill Clinton

is coming into office
with three possible wars to
deal with, alluding to

Somalia, Bosnia and Iraq.
Bush spoke to the crowd of
her fears of another draft
starting.

According to Bush, the
bombing of Iraq by the presi-

dent is his chance to make

some noise before leaving
office.

“Bush is getting in his last
hurrah before leaving,” she
said.

Cassie Geier, vice president
of Pitt Students for Peace,

spoke to the crowd about the
anger she felt when she
heard of the news of the
bombing.

“I feel betrayed by our gov-
ernment,” Geier said.

Geier also spoke of her
anger over the fact that the
United States chose a path of
destruction rather than nego-
tiation to solve the problem
in Iraq.

Many of the participants of
the protests opposed the
bombing strongly, braving
the cold as they stamped
their feet to the cadence of

the protest chants.

“HEY-HEY, HO—HO, FUND-
ING MURDER HAS GOT
TO GO!” students chanted
into the night air.

Protesters held signs read-
ing “Negotiate, not
Annihilate,” and “Bush knows
Bombs.”

Mandy Kivowitz, one of the
members of the protest,
voiced her opinion of the
importance of why she
attended the protest.

“I know that George Bush
doesn’t care about what I
think. He doesn’t give a shit

that I’m out here freezing my
ass, he’s somewhere in the
White House drinking hot
cocoa. But we are angry
enough to be out here, and I
think that says something,”
she said.

“When therevis a problem,
you have to let people know
that things have to be cor-
rected,” Kivowitz said.

According to Kivowitz, the
United States had no business
to go into the Middle East.

“Why is it that we have to
go in and- be the police of
the world?” she asked.

“This is the most radical
change in 30 years of the

_ Medical School,” he added.

Dr. Reed Tuckson, president
of Charles R. Drew University
in Los Angeles, spoke to many
of Pitt’s first-year med students
last Friday. Tuckson empha-
sized the importance of
understanding not only a
patient’s biological makeup

but social situation as well.
"‘You’re in your white coat,
a stethoscope dripping out
of your pocket,” Tuckson
said. “You’re dripping
with respectability. Now, as
you are counseling a young
African-American male, you
notice he’s putting out a ciga-

rette.

“As a doctor you tell him,
‘You’ll get cancer when you’re
50 and heart disease when

you’re 45.’”

“The young man answers
you, ‘Hey doc, I’m not going
to live past 20. In my commu-
nity the leading cause of death
is homicide.”

Tuckson said that doctors
need to have a better under-
standing of a patient like the
one in his example.

“Your school’s new curricu-
lum is right on, dead letter
perfect,” he added.

Bombing Iraq  

The world watched last night as the United States
once again acted against Iraq’s ﬂagrant disregard of
international law. Closer to home, 40-odd people
turned out in Pittsburgh to protest the sending of
1,700 troops and bombing of strategic locations in
Southern Iraq. Again, the citizens of the United States
wonder if it’s necessary for the U.S. to use its military
prowess to police the world.

The bombings were aimed primarily at military
bases. The actions were a result of Iraq’s decision to
move missiles into the No—Fly Zone established by the
allied forces.

As Saddam Hussein smacks hislips, ominously eye-
ing up the Kuwait border (déja Vu?) we are once again
presented with the dilemma of action or tolerance. Is
it better to let this madman go unchecked in the hope
that he doesn’t call our bluff or to take military action

- to suppress his covert military operationsfwhich were ,

expressly forbidden by the United Nations?
It is hard for anyone to endorse any type of bomb-

1 ing. In this case, however, it is the “least bad” of all

thealternatives. Hussein has continuously been a
knife in the back of the world. He has ignored UN
warnings, he has violated the civil rights of Kurds and
Marsh Arabs and he has been a threat to the neighbor-
ing countries. Not to mention the fact that he has
slaughtered thousands of his own people.

Protestors holler because when bombs are dropped,
lives are lost and infrastructure is destroyed —— a noble
stance, if the truth beltold. But even without the allied
intervention, under the command of this irrational dic-
tator, lives have been lost and infrastructure has been
destroyed. Hussein has hardly proven to be a rational
leader, and his continuous nagging has become too
much —— especially at a time when America is in a

_ transitional period.

The condition of Somalia has ushered in discussions
about the newly-defined American military — one
whose actions are motivated solely by humanitarian
motives. Although the United State’s ‘motives in Iraq
are not as. obvious, there is a humanitarian interest.
Clearly, however, the issue is an economic one with
financial interests at the forefront. But, regardless of
the motives, the actions of the allies are justified.
Saddam has killed thousands upon thousands of peo-
ple; he has attempted to control the world’s oil sup-
ply; and he has repeatedly defied the U.N. No-Fly
Zone. ‘ '_

Hussein is clearly issuing a challenge to the world
and it is necessary to respond. We arenot a bunch of
hawks. This question is one of rationality. If Saddam

Hussein continues to act as atyrant, we all los_e. We —

can’t accept that, and neither should George Bush or
Bill Clinton. '

Q:{p§oN

Students express their outrage , 

What a delightful anachro-
nism: Doesn’t Jake Brody and
the SGB realizethat financial
shenanigans, junkets, shameless
greed and blatant political
patronage went out with
George Bush/Ronald Reagan
and the Republicans in the elec-
tion of 1992?

More "importantly, What
exactly did they learn at this
“retreat?” Was constituent ser-
vice a topic of any conversa-
tion? How about “Delegating
Responsibility?” Ten days ago, I
left a written request for an
appointment with Brody at his
office to discuss a problem I
hadduring class registration.
The next day, a staff person at
SGB headquarters informed me
that he had picked up the note.
I have yet to hear from our
president, any member of the
Board or anyone else connect-
ed with student government.

Come to think of it, George
Bush did write back, and at
least, he asks for a contribution.
Here at Pitt, the SGB just grabs
the money.

James P. Zambroski

CAS Undergraduate

After reading Jacob Brody’s
explanation for his decision to
foolishly spend so much money
on the SGB retreat, I have come
to one conclusion: it was the
biggest bull— apology I have
ever heard in my life.

Chuck Van Keuren
Pitt Law ‘95

Brody not so bad

Wary reader take your time,
for The Pitt News has “struck
out” again. Just as they raised
questions about the monies

   

spent for the_ Student
Government Board annual

'-retreat, I too have a few ques-

tions. Is it not The Pitt News’
responsiblity to investigate all
news stories fully, objectively
and accurately? Who better to

substantiate the words and

opinions of Allocations Chair
Lisa Waslo than her boyfriend,
1992 SGB President Gil Golden?
Why were no members of the
1992 board contacted other
than Golden? Why was there so

 'r E as

 

much research done on other
schools SGB retreats, yet no
information was compiled on
the monies actually spent on
Pitt’s past SGB retreats?

For example, the only infor-
mation given about past
expenses quoted the SGB advi-
sor, Joyce Giangarlo, as saying,
“We’ve always overspent that
amount [allocated], and we’ve
always cleared it up on the far
end.” This information which
corroborates Jacob Brody’s
actions was conveniently buried
at the bottom of Tuesday’s arti-
cle (The Pitt News). According
to a 1991 board member, the
SGB retreat for that year was
approximately $9,300. The
money allocated for the retreat
was approximately $5,000 (as

_ this year’s), and it was later

amended and funded after the

V retreat by the allocations com-

mittee.

As stated in T uesday’s article
(The Pitt News), Brody was sent
a letter of denial the Friday of

finals week; however, Brody,.

Perpective writers meeting today at 5:00P.M.

who left to visit his family in

receive the letter until the start.
of the new terrn. Folks, that
was Jan. 6; the retreat took
place on the 8th. Is it feasible
without loss of money to cancel
and reschedule  a retreat of
this magnitude? Do the words
“set up” mean anything to you?
More importantly, how can

. we trust the The Pitt News if it

allows itself to be manipulated
andtreated as a pawn? Most
student organizations paid for
by our student activities orga-
nize leadership training retreats.
Would it not have been more
applicable to compare the
amount spent by other organi-
zations (at Pitt) than by other
schools?

The selection process of The
Pitt News to biasedly choose
non-researched, non—objective
information is a blatant viola-
tion of journalistic integrity. Just
one more example of the inept-
ness is not only in Wednesday’s

, Perspective section, but also in

Managing Editor Jim Lakely’s
editorial. President pro tempore
Ted Schroeder was elected by
ther entire 1993 SGB, not
appointed by Brody as the arti-
cles imply. ‘

It is also important to know,
which Ted Schroeder stated on
his platform, that he is graduat-
ing at the end of his term;
therefore, _ is not being
“groomed” to become the next
SGB president —-— which was
alluded to in Wednesday’s
Perspective section. The Pitt
News has struck out, lost the

‘game and lost the champi-

onships.

Rub-a-dub-dub: There's nothing more that Antoine (Jean Rochefort) loves as much as a washing in Patrice Leconte’s The Hairdresser ’s Husband.

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

French director Patrice Leconte’s lat-
est import, Tbe Hatrdresser’s
Husband, is a striking, meandering
erotic effort that tells a warped tale of
a man obsessed with fashion salons.

Early in life, Antoine (lean
Rochefort) knows that he wants to be
2.1 hairdresser’s husband. Leconte
shows us Antoine’s infatuation from
the. film’s get go, as we see a young

Antoine rushing to visit the busty
Madameshaeffer at her shop. As his
voice is dubbed in, Antoine recalls, in
near—Pent/oouse forum prose, his lust
for the loping Madame. “It was very
hot, she smelled divine,” he tells us as
Leconte’s camera slowly moves back
and forth as he gets a shampoo and a
haircut and a fine look at the
madame’s healthy chest.

Leconte offers this and later scenes
in a sensual, yet sophisticated man-
ner. He purposely lets his cameras do

sly tricks to invoke an erotic overtone
in the film. The camera goes into slow
motion when we meet Mathilde (Anna
Galiena), An»toine’s future wife, her
hair ﬂying and red dress flapping as
she flashes a smile that will become a
fixture throughout. Antoine gazes at
her in awe, completely enamored
with her beauty.

While Leconte means this as a way
to put forth eroticism and sexuality as
the film’s prevailing stylistic theme, it
reeks a bit of a foul play. The slo—mo

camera work and infatuating prose
plays upon the Hollywood genre of
obsessive love. It's a subtle spoof and
one that isn’t as effective as it could
be. Leconte just leaves it dangling out
there, not willing to make the full
Commitment, but not wanting to shy
away from the playfullness of the
issue entirely.

The film jumps 40 years later, in a
fashion that is never explained, to
Antoine spotting Mathilde in :1 salon

SWOB:

Once upon a time in a galaxy
far, far away, three little boys
dreamed of becoming super-
stars —— the rock variety. The
testicular chambers of rock
legend are filled with hallowed
regalia _such as the make-up
kit of Gene Simmons, the
quintuple necked phalluses of
Rick Nielson and the missing
tooth of Percy Sledge. These
boys wanted in. They experi-
mented with mop tops,
weight-loss drugs and pacts
with British witches only to
find that it had all been done
before. One, responding to his
own demonic Colonel Tom
Parker, even took the route of
The King and joined the Army.

But alas, not one teenage but-

tercup shed a tear in patriotic
admiration for the young buck.

They were Swob and the
noise they slung was perfectly
designed, tailored and project-

obsequious fanboys and doe-
eyed pretties into the kind of
obsessional devotion that leads

An AIDS

grips
Hoover's
Eulogy

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

Eulogy is a play about death.
Surprised? Didn’t think so, but
the play, penned by local In
Pittsburgh theater critic Ted
Hoover, is also about loss; the
grim reality of losing a close
friend to AIDS.

The play centers around three
women who shared the same
friend, a sensitive Southern
homosexual man from Georgia
who recently‘ died of AIDS. Had
Tennessee Williams been
around writing in this era of
siphoned freedom of artistic
license, maybe he would’ve cre-
ated a character like George.

Techno
beats its
Way into
popular
culture

By Paul Williams
For T be Pitt News

What is techno? The word
doesn’t appear in Webster’s
Collegiate Dictionary, so this
is my interpretation —-— elec-
tronic-dance music, with a
storm of thundering sub-bass,
intermitting beeps, eerie
piano and carefully orches-
trated samples organized into
rhythms that taunt 150 beats
per minute.

Usually songs are instru-
mentals and melody free.
Frequent grounds to meet for

the techno shows are called»

raves, they began in the sum-
mer of 1988 with the sounds
of The Happy Mondays and
the Stone Roses supplying the
tunes, but rave has evolved
into acid house and techno.
The acid raves began as a
result of Chicago-house
music, which was getting the
primary focus at UK dance
clubs, with the rejuvenation
of hallucinating drugs and a
bunch of kids getting together
and dancing. As police began
to raid these raves they went
underground, and few illegal
raves remained. Sounds from
America that began the rave
scene were replaced, and new
sounds resurrected the dead

Hoffa:

Just who was Jimmy Hoffa
— hero of the working man
or just a self-motivated thug?
Anyone looking for evidence
in Hoffa that might make him
appear to be either will be
disappointed. This is not the
“re-educating” cinema pro-
posed by Oliver Stone and
Spike Lee in their latest bio-
pics. Writer David Mamet and
director Danny Devito seem
more interested in selling
myth than ideas.

Hoffa is all style. From
Nicholson’s Oscar rants to
Devito’s dramatic camera the
film never lets up on the idea
of Jimmy Hoffa as spectacle.
The attention to detail in cos-
turning the period takes prece-
dence over any explanation of
the film’s actions, especially
Hoffa’s. In Mamet’s script the
labor movement and the con-
spiracies of power amount to
a lot of window dressing for
Nicholson’s one man show
and take a back seat to
Devito’s Bobby Ciaro as the
film’s major plot vehicle. The
two scenes where Hoffa and
Bobby Kennedy exchange
insults trade in on the mythol-
ogy of the two historical play-

about his significance or that
of his death. Okay this is
Hollywood not PBS, but in
light of the work done by
Stone and Lee it seems prob-
lematic to ignore this aspect
altogether. In doing so, James
R. Hoffa becomes just an
overblown fictional caricature
instead of a significant histori-
cal figure — all affect and no
character. Hoffa is testimony
to Hollywood’s ability to cre-

ate spectactle and myth in the
midst of reality. The film plays
that part perfectly — Jimmy
Hoffa remains an enigma.
Only now he’s on film.

men holed up in an aban-
doned factory against a whole
posse of annoyed St. Louis
gangstas. Well, that’s not all.
It’s about FEAR; the fear of
poverty, the fear of dying an
unknown working class fire-
man with not much to prove
you even existed beyond a
souped up 4 X 4 and canceled
alimony checks.

It is about entitlement. That
is what leads every bumpkin
to gangland in search of
buried treasure, and that is
what leads every gangsta to
chase them out. Hostage situa-
tion — The Treasure of the
Sierra Merde. This isn’t just
any old shoot-out in the OK

sense of social justice underly-l‘
ing the slick camerawork, sin-
ister Ry Coodersoundtrack

Aladdin

It’s Robin Williams without
restraint: Disney’s Aladdin is
unique solely because of the
comic’s unrestrained bril-
liance. The third of a line of
recent Disney’s cartoon musi-

cals, the score and artistry is ~

up to Disney’s. standards creat-

ed by Tloe Little Mermaid and

Beauty and The Beast. This
movie may have been the
closest thing to the perfect
vehicle for Williams, whose
genie character is as physically
unlimited as Williams’ creative
mind. And, of course, there is
a love story to pull the normal
heartstrings. A must-see for
Disney fanatics, and, as the
cliche states, children of all
ages.
P.S. Listen for Gilbert Gottfried
as the bad—guy parrot.

Leap of Faith:

Doc Hollywood meets Jim
Bakker. '

Starring Steve Martin as the
sleazy preacher of a rock-and-
soul travelling minstrel show
sidetracked in a small mid-
western town, Faitb follows
the hustling, bustling ambiva-
lence of Minister Martin when
the high stakes of Pray TV
meet the innocent realities of
depressed middle America.

The plotline? Predictable.

Evil confronts good. They
tussle a bit. You know the
rest.

While thoughts of the multi-
talented Martin cavorting on a
pulpit sounds tempting, don’t
take the bait. Despite some
slick scenes with walking
wordsmith Steve, Faith comes
off as an awkward, off-kilter
light drama that doesn’t know
where to go.

Word around Hollywood
says that Faith was rushed
through production so it could
be released for the holiday
season.

No wonder it didn’t fly.
Does the word “patience” ring
a bell? Apparently not.

Eulogy

Continued from page S-2

George under very different circumstances, so
each has a unique relationship with him. The three
women must come together to mourn the loss of a
dear friend and deal with this huge void created in
their lives by his loss.

As with most bad news, the action begins with a
phone call in the middle of the night. We watch as
each woman receives the news in her own envi-
ronment, on her own tenns. This call prompts the
women to converge in New York City for the ser-
vice. Having met. only one time previously in the
hospital at George’s request, the women are prac-
tically strangers with no ties binding them together
except their love for George. There is a great deal
of conﬂict and ﬂashback and naturally a lot of
emotional purging due to the subject matter.
Oddly enough, in the context of an AIDS play, the
script really doesn’t try to shove AIDS awareness
down your throat, instead it does something more
subtle. It shows the deadly effects of the disease
on the living. George is dead at the beginning of
the play and there is really nothing anyone can do
to bring him back except remember him. This is
the task left for his good friends.

Charlotte, a sometimes wallﬂower of a house-
wife, has known George since childhood and was
the last one to learn of his ilhaess. She is also the
most uncontrolled in her grieving process. At first
glance, she is the sheltered Southern woman, but
Hoover weaves his characters into a richer tapestry
instead of relying on stale stereotypes, and in the
end, we see Charlotte is much stronger than that.

Strength is what Samantha seems to embody. A
fast—track, trash-talkin’, single career woman of the
‘80s, Samantha doesn’t take shit from anyone. But

Hair

Continued from page S-1
she has recently been given.

like Charlotte, she has another side that the audi-
ence only catches in ﬂeeting glimpses. Her brash-
ness strikes an impeccable balance with Charlotte’s
hospitality.

A third dimension to the character conﬂict is
added in the form of Lucy, a lesbian AIDS activist.
She is really a stabilizing factor in the aftermath of
George’s death and she handles it unbelievably
well when compared to the other two women.

Despite the seriousness of the play, Hoover
manages to throw out some pretty hilarious lines
in his dialogue. In a conversation between George
and Samantha, she laments about how awful the
dating scene is and utters a gem of a quote about
men. She says, “You don’t think I’d actually
attempt a conversation with a straight man, do
you? They won’t even listen if they don’t think
their tum to talk isn’t coming up soon.”

As far as the acting is concerned, I don’t think
I’ve.seen a finer trio of actresses on a Pittsburgh
stage. Tey Stiteler brings enough coarse, rushed
mannerisms and bigger-than-life gestures to make
Samantha downright obnoxious and at the same
time endearing. She lays it on a bit thick at times,
but the fomiula alwaysworks. After all, subtlety is
hardly one of Samantha’s finer attributes.
However, subtle can be used to describe Nona
Gerard’s performance. She approaches the charac-
ter of Lucy with a realness that comes with every-
day experience making her extremely believable.
Patricia Grace’s Georgia dialect has the perfect
drawl _and never becomes annoying.

Due to the intimacy of the play and the size of its 
cast, it is well-suited to Pitt’s Studio Theatre. The ;,
world premiere of Eulogy runs this weekend fan. .

Antoine is nothing butwhen

The trouble here is the
spotty script which asks us to
feel more than common sense
will allow us. After 40 years,
which we know nothing of, it
is hard to believe that Leconte
hasn’t found another stylist.
The couple’s obvious age dif-
ference is never addressed
either. The sudden marriage
problem is cleared up as the
film progresses. No couple
has ever been happier than
this one, Antoine completely
content to run errands and
watch Mathilde joyfully slash
and splash customers. He
stares endlessly at her as if it
were the first time he’d spot-
ted her. Mathilde’s high cheek
bones, big lips and wide
smile subjugate him time and
time again.

The pair do very little
except have sex, passionately.

full of soap, Antoine kneels.

“What could they offer for
our relationship?” Antoine
asks. In one episode, they
drink cologne and hair tonics
while smoking cigarettes as a
new outlet for excitement.

‘Just as the story begins to
wane, because it doesn’t
seem to be able to go any-
where further than the cou-
ple’s desperate clinging,
Leconte throws in an ending
that is scarcely hinted at.
Again, the script asks you to
feel the moment, not antici-
pate or interpret it. The end-
ing motif "is as old as the cine-
ma itself, it isn’t stunningly
effective, but it isn’t awful.
Like the film and its charac-
ters, the passion can’t run
out. ~
This is one film where the
music has an obvious and
pertinent effect. Michael
Nyman’s brooding and mini-
malist score sets the tone for
the 1over’s powerful love. It
also fits perfectly with
Leconte’s erotic nuances.

Antoine, on the other hand,
dances wildly to mid-eastern
rhythms, flailing his arms
wildly. Aside from Mathilde, it
his only pleasure in life.

The acting is quite fine
throughout, particularly by
Galiena, who pulls off
Mathilde’s giddy flair and sud-
den desperation with ease.
Her physical features (smile
and cheeks) make it easy for
her to act lovestruck and
happy as her role calls for.
Rochefort plays the mesmer-
ized Antoine with a wonder-
ful childlike intensity. Both
character’s are so pathetically
“idealistic -that it’s hard not to
feel for them.

French Director Patrice
Leconte, best /enown for his
smash international
Monsieur Hire, returns with

Hairdresser’s Husband.

dance scene.

Techno was started by threeteenage
friends — Derrick May, Kevin Sunderson
and Juan Atkins, who were amazed by the
sounds of New Order, Depeche Mode and
Kraftwerk. Working in makeshift bedroom
studios they created electronic sounds that
went unappreciated by the Detroit dance
community. However, a UK record label
decided to release this sound, “Detroit
Techno.” And techno was out of the gate.

The ‘90s craved for new music and talent
burst everywhere across the world. 808
State and Orbital were some of the earliest
UK techno grooves that sent people to
clubs, absorbing its synthesized beats.
Techno soon grew into a sub-culture, as
people came to dance at a growing rate,
and producers jumped on the rush by drop-
ping new beats. Belgium caught on quickly,
accelerating the beats per minute, and DJs
pumped furious rhythms as the evolution of
hardcore techno was complete.

The UK’s massive dance scene ushered
the deluge of hardcore techno groups in.
UK techno sounds reached the top 40
charts. Altern 8 was one of the first groups
to land in the charts with its smash “Activ-

8,” which featured a five-year-old, MC
Crazy Clair, who spawned the phrase “top
one, nice one, get sorted,” which became a
notorious phrase for getting high on
Ecstasy. Altern-8 also introduced an identity
that ravers could worship. The duo sported
green nuclear fallout protection suits and
gas masks that bear its name. While attach-
ing an identity to techno had been a prob-
lem, Altern-8 had scams that made the
group unique. It bought a hot air balloon
to travel from rave to rave in, then pur-
chased a military landing craft to hold
portable raves from. It even ran for
Parliament as the “hardcore U know the
score.”

America has become the latest frontier for
the wandering techno pioneers. L.A. Style,
from Belgium, scored on the American
Billboard charts with its single “James
Brown Is Dead.” The video for The Utah
Saints, a UK outfit, has landed consistently
in heavy rotation on MTV. But, the idea
,and now likelihood of techno turning into a
pop-culture, similar to alternative music
moving into the mainstream, has many DJ s
angry.

Swob

Continued from page S-2
inroads to immortality with the release
of the Tragus 7” on Pop Bus Records,
certain big names on the indie rock net-
work, recognizing the potential threat to
their own hegemonic control, wanted
Swob squashed. An insidious viral chain
of rumor, deception and scandal slowly
eroded the band’s reputation until, like
many potential starlings, Swob fell off
the rock and roll ladder.

For three months the members of-
Swob langoured in bitter isolation and
obscurity, their rage silenced by the
frustration that is endemic to the denial
of superstardom to ones so talented, so
sincere, so happening. Then, just as fast
as they fell, they rose again. Manny
Theiner, the Medici of the Pittsburgh
indie rock scene, searching for fresh
meat for his “Alternative, My Eye” rock

Bridge Tavern, tripped over a drunken,
Lingo bumming change in front of a 7-
ELEVEN.

“My first reaction was to spit on him,”
says Theiner. “But then I realized who
he was.”

Theiner took the boys in, gave them
showers, food, new stage clothes and

and roll showcases at the Bloomfield .

now its seems as if they’re back on that
Golden Highway. In this exclusive Pitt
News interview MC Lingo gives you, the
readers, a chance to see where his head
is on the eve of his big comeback:

Q: At one point you were labeled
the “First Lady of Lust.” How did that
make you feel?

A: There were times when I hated
that image because it limited me on a
one-to-one level. Reporters would come
to interview me and I’d see them shak-
ing as they opened their notebooks.
They were so hyped up by this sex god-

dess business. I realize that my name is-

still synonymous with disco and I’m
nowhere close to where I want to be
musically. But you’re always going to
have that tension between the artistic
and the commercial.

Q; Although that image is fading,
people will never forget that part of
your career when you released
Tragus. Does that stigma bother you
today?

A: No, it doesn’t bother me as long as
people don’t touch me. It’s a strange
thing about me, like a tic or something,
but I don’t like to have people touching

me at all. I find it an imposition on my
person when people put their hands on
me. It’s all Clint Eastwood’s fault. He
was always grabbing me.

This Thursday will be an important
milestone in the Swob epic. At 10 p.m.
Swob will reassume its destiny on the
cavernous soundstage of the Bloomfield
Bridge Tavern. Not many performers get
a second chance at stardom. Even fewer
audiences get the chance to witness
one. Fewer still are the fledgling acts
that get to be a part of it all. Theiner,
true to trufﬂe-digging form, has discov-
ered another punk rock meteor. On the
opening slot, Liverball, the punk rock
lineup you never expected, will warm
up the crowds on the aforementioned
evening. Combining elements of high
speed aggro-rock and three cycle
engine service know—how, Liverball
promises to rise further, farther and
faster than any other lounge act since
Blue Cheer.

Be a part of history not riuallea’ since
the firehomhing of the Fillmore. That's
tonight at the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern,
the return of Swob and the arrival of
Bad Livers

Len1ieux's teammates feel conﬁdent about his return

By George Klimis
Staff Writer

It was hard to tell that any-
thing was wrong by the way
the Pittsburgh Penguins were
acting yesterday after practice.

In fact, one
would find it
hard to believe
that their star
player, the
same one who
led his team to
two consecutive Stanley Cups,
had been diagnosed with

' Hodgkin’s disease.

Tuesday, the Penguins
announced that All-Star center
Mario Lemieux has Hodgkin’s

disease. However, everyone in
the organization seems upbeat
about the situation.

Because doctors discovered
the cancer in such an early
stage, the Penguins expect
Lemieux to return to the lineup
in approximately four to six
weeks. The diagnosis was
made after doctors removed an
enlarged lymph node from his

neck.

“I think people who don’t
understand the disease make it
worse than it is,” Penguin
goalie Tom Barrasso said. “He
feels fine.”

Lemieux was diagnosed in an
early stage with the Nodullar

which is the most favorable
type of the disease. The
Penguins say that the cure rate
for his disease is over 90 per-
cent.

“It’s more of an annoying
thing,” Barrasso said. “But I
think he’ll breeze right through
this.”

Barrasso also said that
Lemieux was in a good situa-
tion. His disease was discov-

ered early because of all the —

medical attention he receives as
an NHL player.

Lemieux was at the Civic
Arena before yesterday’s prac-
tice to be treated for a bruise
he received during a game.
Teammate Rick Tocchet said

that everything seemed normal.

“He was here and we were
talking about cards and golf,”
Tocchet said. “It was more of
just a scare to everyone.”

The Penguins’ team physician
Charles Burke explained
Hodgkin’s disease to the play-
ers before yesterday’s practice.

“We really feel great about
it,” left-winger Bob Errey said.
“The cure rate is very high.

“We’re going to have prob-
lems but we’ve gotten through
them before,” Errey said.

In the 1990-91 season,
Lemieux played in only 26
games after recovering from
back surgery. However, in the
playoffs, Lemieux led with 44

Lympocytic form of cancer,

Lemieux ’s illness a continuation of Pens ’ curse

Did I miss something? Did a Gypsy
woman put a curse on the Pittsburgh
Penguins?

Is there some mystical force roaming
through the cosmos whose only purpose
is to make it as difficult as possible for the
Pens to keep winning? Or am I to believe
that it’s all just dumb luck?! Man oh man,
that’s a tough pill to swallow. Nobody can
have that much bad luck.

I mean, think about it. In the past two
seasons leading up to this year, the Pens
have suﬂfered through:

1) 100+ games without Mario Lemieux ‘

because of his back injury.

2) The death of Coach Bob Johnson.

5) The sale of their team.

4) Trades that sent three of their all-
stars (john Cullen, Paul Coffey and Mark
Recchi) packing.

Not to mention the strike that nearly
ended their run at a second straight

Stanley Cup, as well as the rape charges
earlier this year involving former Penguin
Dan Quinn and the report that Lemieux
was involved.

Yet, through all this incredible adversity,
the Pens emerged on top with two Stanley

Tom  
Schneider

Cups. I don’t know, maybe all the distrac-
tions actually help them to get fired up.

Now, with the Pens off to their best start
in club history and Lemieux on pace to
break Wayne Gretzky’s single-season scor-
ing record of 215 points, the Gypsy shows
her ugly face. Presto! Mario Lemieux is
stricken with Hodgkin’s" disease.

Penguin fans have to be asking “What
next?” All we need to happen now is for

the team charter to plunge into the ocean.
Then maybe the Gypsy will be satisfied.
In all fairness, doctors and team officials
are being a little bit toooptimistic when
they say Lemieux’s return is possible in
four to six weeks. Let’s face it. Lemieux
was taken out of the lineup a little over a
week ago, complaining of soreness in his
ailing back. That fact, coupled with the
strong possibility that Lemieux will require
radiation treatment, make it very difficult
for me to believe that a return in six
weeks is at all possible. , -
Then again, we are talking about Mario
Lemieux. This is the man whose mere
image strikes fear in the heart of every
goaltender in the league. This is the man
who came back after missing nearly three
quarters of the 1990-’91 season to win the
Conn Smythe trophy and lead his team to
its first-ever Stanley Cup championship.
See Lemieux, page 11

points en route to the
Penguins’ first Stanley Cup. He
also won the Conn Smythe
Trophy as the playoffs Most
Valuable Player. I

This season, Lemieux leaves
the Penguins with a 29-11-4
record, the best in the NHL.
They also lead the Washington
Capitals by 14 points in the
Patrick Division.

“I’m just glad we got a pretty
big lead,” Tocchet said. “We
got enough to make it through
the storm.

“We’re not down-playing [the
disease],” Tocchet added. “Who
cares about hockey, we just
want him to get his health
back.”

Lemieux is the league’s scor-
ing leader with 104 points (39
goals and 65 assists), 22 points
ahead of Buffalo’s Pat
LaFontaine. Lemieux was on
pace to break Wayne Gretzky
record of 215 points in a sea-
son. A

The Penguins say that subse-
quent tests ‘have shown no evi-
dence of any other problems.
Lemieux will undergo further
treatment in the form of radia-
tion for a one month period.
The site of his treatment has
not been disclosed; .

Hodgkin’s disease is usually
found among males between
the ages of 20-28. Each year
between 5,000 to 6,000 people
are diagnosed with the disease.

Lemieux was unavailable for
comment, but will speak at a
press conference Friday along
with Penguins’ owner Howard
Baldwin and General Manager
Craig Patrick.

Panthers take stab at Pirates after bounding the Huskies

ByRobPugliese

Sports Assistant

Prior to the start of college bas-
ketball season, you would have
had to look long and hard for
someone who didn’t peg Seton
Hall as the overwhelming class of
the Big East.

Anyone who felt otherwise
would likely be carted off to the
looney bin. 1

On paper, the Pirates are a pow-
erhouse. Unfortunately for the rest
of the country, thejfre also a pow-
erhouse on the basketball ﬂoor.

Seton Hall has many key ele-
ments it takes to reach the Final
Four — a superstar, a great coach,
a deep bench, multi-talented role
players and a relentless work ethic.

The seventh-ranked Pirates are
on a roll, winning 11 straight games
and their ﬁrst four Big East contests.
They’ll invade Fitzgerald Field
House Saturday night at 8 p.m. and
will be greeted by a Pitt club com-
ing olf its biggest Big East win in
years, an 80-78 upset of 15th-
ranked Connecticut Tuesday night

Seton Hall’s only loss of the sea-
son came way back on Nov. 27
when number four Indiana nipped
the Pirates 78-74 in the champi-
onship game of the preseason NIT

Totunament

Since then, the Hall has cranked
it up despite losing junior point
guard Bryan Caver to injury.
Conference victims have been
Miami, Connecticut, Providence
and Syracuse. The Pirates displayed
an impressive team effort Monday
night in an 80-73 win over the
Orangemen.

Pitt proved at UConn that it

- could be a legitimate Top 25 club.

A win over Seton Hall could further
that notion. But the Panthers need
ﬂawless execution to knock off PJ.
Carlesimo’s crew.

Cariesirno’s having a rough year.
First he spends his entire summer
as an assistant coach for the Dream
Team. Now he comes back to
work, ﬁnding only an All-American
guard, a deadly baseline sniper, a
relentless low-post wanior and a
mammoth talent in the middle.
This cast has most coaches salivat-
ing. '

The main man is All-American
shooting guard Teny Dehere. The
6-foot, 4-inch senior has evolved
into a legitimate superstar. He cur-
rently averages 23 points per game
and thrives on pressure situations.
Pitt will have problems containing
Dehere, a steely veteran who
brings exactly what you want from

a senior to the ﬂoor. .

Seasoning has come through
international experience (‘91 Pan
American Games, ‘90 Junior
National Team) and his tireless
work ethic, which has allowed for
steady improvement from season
to season. _

“I think he really shows people
that ifyou come in and work  he
wasn’t the Bobby Hurley in high
school, everyone’s All-American 
now he’s developed into one of
the best players in the country,”
Seton Hall assistant coach Bruce
Hamburger said “He knows what
it takes to be successful at this level.
He wants the ball in his hands at
the end of the game.”

Forward Arturas Kamishovas is
the deadly baseline sniper, possess-
ing deep range. The 6’8” junior
averages a shade under 14 points
—— shooting 55 percent from the
ﬂoor — and six rebounds. He won
a bronze medal while scoring 11
ppg for Lithuania at the Summer
Olympics.

Tenacity exudes from the rock
on the blocks that is Jerry Walker.
Generously listed at 67”, Walker
grudgingly battles taller players
using every bit of his 245—pound
frame. He averages 12 points and

Youth mles
Pitt met/z’s
gymnastics

Byjeremy Swarbrick
Staﬂ'Writer

If you were to look down the
bench at Pitts men’s gymnastics
team this season, you might not
recognize many of the faces.

After facing an injury—plaquecl
1992 campaign, head coach Frank
D’Amico is now facing a different
difficulty in ‘95 —— youth and inex-
perience.

Of the 15 competitors on this
years roster, seven of them will be
competing in their first collegiate
season. In order to remain compet-
itive, D"Amico will not have the
luxury of allowing any of his rook-
ies to season before they are
thrown into real competition.

Another problem that D’Amico
will have to face will be one of
team cohesion. While his teams in
the past have had the benefit of
competing together for a few sea-
sons, this year that will not be the
case. Seven lettermen from last
years squad are no longer eligible
for competition.

\Y/hile the potential of Pittls abili-
ties lies in the hands of its younger
competitors, the man leading them
into battle is dually qualified.
Entering his 16th season with the
Panthers, D’Amico has posted an
impressive record of 151-75, his
best season coming in 1991 when
the Panthers exploded to a 21-4

Lemieux-

Continued from page 9
This is the man who won
the NHL scoring title last
year despite missing 16
games and playing most
of the rest under extreme
pain and discomfort.

But this is also the man
who, annoyed and aggra-
vated by the relentless
pain he faced every night,
considered retiring last
season. Lemieux is an
ironman, but even an
ironman has his limits.
And I’m sure that this
recent discovery has done
little for his perseverance.
An average player in
Lemieux’s situation would
have called it quits long
ago; Come to think of it,
even a great player would
have cashed in his chips
by now.

0 But we’re not talking
about an average player,
an above average player
or even a great player._ We
are talking about the best
hockey player on the
planet Earth. Lemieux is
no quitter.

He will continue to fight
until his body simply
won’t let him fight any
longer. Hodgkin’s may
very well be the straw that
broke the camel’s back.
Then again, Lemieux
could grace the Penguin
roster again very shortly.
The weeks ahead should
shed some light.

Until then, the disease is
the only thing standing
between Mario and a wide
open net.

The domination of two
individual players was new

“I don't remember when

we had two 20-point scor-
ers on the Same team,”
Bruce said.

Pitt was paced by Jonna
Huemrich and Jill Colabrese
who each scored 12. Center
Turia Ransom added 11.

The Panthers jumped to
an early six-point lead in
the first half. Colabrese laid
in a missed shot at 14:21 of
the first to stake Pitt to a
14-8 advantage. They led
by as many as eight in the
period, but began to slip.

A Kenneally six-footer
tied the score at 25 with
4:47 remaining and put the
Orangewomen right back
into the competition.

Pitt responded with a
Huemrich stick-back and a
Colabrese three—pointer to
take a five-point lead with
2:34 remaining.

But after a couple of bas-

kets, Syracuse center Holly
Oslander banked in a
seven-foot shot that sent
the teams into the locker
room tied at 33.

The second half began
much like the first as Pitt
jumped out to a quick four-
point lead.

Two sets of free throws
by Colabrese and Erin
Maloy gave Pitt a 37-33
edge, and the Panthers kept
their advantage until mid-
way through the period
when Oslander hit a lay-up
at 11:36 and gave the
Orangewomen a lead they
would lose only once the
rest of the way.

The final two minutes
provided the Panthers with
several opportunities to tie
or go ahead, but foul
shooting proved to be their
downfall.

 

Panther center Turia
Ransom hit one of two
from the line to cut into the
Syracuse lead and tie it at
59, but Kenneally’s driving
layup with only 29 ticks left
ended putting the Orange
up for good.

Ransom had a chance to
tie the game with seven
seconds when she went to
the line for two shots, but
as the ball caromed off the
rim she was forced to foul
Oslander, and for all pur-
poses ended the game.

Bruce said that after
Oslander’s miss, Huemrich
went to the line for two
free throws and missed
them both.

Pitt resumes its schedule
with a-2 p.m. game on
Saturday against the
Georgetown Hoyas at
Fitzgerald Field House.

THE prrr NEWS, Thursday, Plum 14, 1993 . lﬁ
Gymnastics

Continued from page 10
record Before D’Amico’s arrival in

. 1978, Pitt had never had a winning

record in men’s gymnastics.

This season should prove to be
just another hurdle in D’Amico’s
solid career.

I.eading the Panthers this year is
senior captain Genaro Severino.
Last year, Severino’s season was
cut short by a knee injury in early
Spring. Before his injury, Severino
was far and away Pitt’s best com-
petitor, holding the school’s all-
time individual all-around record
with a score of 56.40. This year,
Pitt will count on the leadership

. abilities of its captain, on and off

the ﬂoor.

Joining Severino as Pitt’s elder
statesmen are seniors Pete
Crowley, Mark Saleem and Matt
Jager. Last season Crowley com-
peted the entire season on his best

event, the pommel horse, earning
a personal best score of 7.60.

Like Crowley, Sa1eem’s talents
were also concentrated in one
area, the stationary rings. Saleem
has made marked improvements
inhisskills,whicheamedhima
personalbestscoreof8.60onhis
particular apparatus. _

Jager competed solidly last sea-
son, working the high bar, parallel
bars and the rings, where he
became one of the Panthers’ more
consistent performers.

Also returning to the squad this
year are sophomores Jon Shapiro
and Michael Solpietro.

At 5—feet, 1-inch, Shapiro tumed
out to be Pitt’s little big man.
Although nagged by injuries for
most of the early part of the year,
he came up big on more than one
occasion on his specialty last sea-
son, the pommel horse. This year,

Shapiro will probably be counted
on as an all-around competitor,
and the hard work and determina-
tionheshowedinhisﬁrstseason
should serve as example to his
younger teammates.

After performing on the reserve
squad last season, Solpitro will be
looking to step into the regular
line-up. Solpietro’s best events are
the vault, the high bar and the
ﬂoor exercises, but he will also be
expected to perform as an all-
around competitor this year.

This year’s first-year class is led

by all-around competitor Jason.

Lannie. Last year, Lannie was the
New Jersey state champion in the
all-around competition and this
year, D’Amico expects him to
jump right into the Panthers’ start-
ing line-up. 8‘

Joining Lannie are fellow first-
year competitors Karl Chan,

Michael Maurer, Brian Narvaez,
Chris Scalise, Chris Sweetin and
Keith Youndt.

Chan, who is being compared to
fomier Panther Kyle MacBeth, will
look to fill the big shoes left
behind by the now-departed per-
former. Chan competed in the all-
around in high school.

Maurer also competed as an all-
aroundinhighschoolandwasthe
New Jersey state champion on the
high bar in 1991 and ‘92, but
D’Amicoexpedshimtoﬁllinnice-
ly for the Panthers on the rings.

Narvaez joins Iannie as one of
the Panthers’ top all-around
prospects. His strongest events are
on the vault and the ﬂoor, but
D’Amico said he feels Narvaez is
ready to plug some of the holes
left by last year’s senior class.

Scalise, whose best event is the
pommel horse, will be looked to

provide depth to the Panthers’
solid. but youthful all-around line-
up.

If any‘ of Pitt’s fab ﬁrst—year class
came to school with an impressive
background in’ gymnastics, it
would be Sweetin. He garnered
three PIAA state championships
(‘87, ‘88 and ‘91), while setting
some impressive personal records
on the way in the vault (9.80), the
high bar (9.80) and in the all-
around (52.00). Coach D’Amico
said he expects Sweetin to excel in
his collegiate career with the
Panthers.

Another athlete the Panthers
expect to use -immediately is
Youndt. He is a well-rounded
gymnast but shows the most
potential on the rings. ‘D’Amico
said he will be expecting Youndt
to slide right into Pitt’s starting line-
up.
