Shapp’s New Budget
Termed Insufficient

by MIKE MILLER

Vice Chancellor of Finance,
Edison Montgomery has predict-
ed that Governor Milton J.
Shapp’s record budget provisions
for education will do little to
solve the University’s financial
dilemma.

The Governor's proposed bud-
get includes a $3 billion provi-
sion for education, welfare,
the environment and other cur-
rent problems.

The University of Pittsburgh
is slated to receive $43.2 million
of this amount.

In addition, the State Senate
unanimously approved a bill
authorizing payment of the Uni-
versity’s $18.9 million delayed
subsity. Payment was withheld
earlier when the State's coffers
ran dry, 'but increased taxes
have relieved the financial
drought..

According to Montgomery, the
proposed budget is not sufficient
to meet operating needs of the
University.

The appropriation makes no
provision for the interest pay-
ments incurred when the delay
of the subsidy for 1970-71 forc-
ed the University to borrow
operating money.

“We have to give grave and
serious consideration to what
we are going to do," Montgom-
ery stated..

The Vice Chancellor forsees
more problems with delayed

payments.
Governor Shapp hopes that
the Legislature will conclude

its business by June. 30. Accord-
ing to press reports, the Legis-
lature is not optimistic on this
point.

If Pitt's sppropriation is among
unfinished business, Mont-
gomery fears the University may
be right back where it-started..

The $18.9 million subsidy for
1970-71 will be of little help,
Montgomery said, since it is to
be paid in two installments,
one in September and one in
December.

The appropriation in the pro-
posed budget is also $6.6 mil-
lion less than requested.

“Some change in plans will
result, but it is premature to say
exactly what they will
Montgomery said. .

He also stated that if other
measures fail to relieve the
financial strain, a tuition raise
is possible.

“The only favorable part is
that there is a definite amount
with which we can work," he
said.

Forbes Moratorium Ends

may 18, 1911.

Demolition Bids Asked

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor
The University is prepared to
accept bids from contractors

for the demolition of Forbes
Field.

A series of ads to that effect
were to have appeared in the
Pittsburgh Press beginning last
Thursday. Though the city news-
paper strike prevented this,
Director of the Physical Plant
Division, Hunt Martin said that
the University would, advertise
in the papers of other cities.

The University’s decision to
advertise for bids for the razing
of Forbes Field signaled the
end of a 30 day moratorium on
the destruction of the ball park.
The moratorium, second consecu-
tive 30-day delay, ended Friday.

A request for a third delay
by members of the Oakland com-
munity was turned down by the
University. The University did
agree, however, to meet with
architects and other community
spokesmen this week to discuss
alternatives to the Forbes, Phase
I project and to stop soliciting
bids if an acceptable alternative
is developed..

The third delay was asked and
refused at a meeting Wednesday
evening attended by representa-
tives of the University, the com-
munity, and the city. At the
meeting, architects Walter
Boykowycz and Richard Brit-

ain presented an alternative to‘

the University's Phase I project.

The alternative plan, accord-
ing to its designers, provides
for all proposed University ex-
pansion for the next 15 years
without transcending current
University boundaries or displac-
ing any Oakland residents.

Martin: 'I‘inu- in factor.

The plan leaves the outfield
of Forbes open for recreational
use, employing only the stands
areas for new University build-
ings. It also calls for a much
greater density of buildings in
the area north of Fifth Ave..
the

Buildings surrounding

cathedral on the lawn are blue-

printed by the architects. They
also propose underground park-
ing beneath the Cathedral,
Schenley Plaza, and Forbes
Field, Schenley Plaza would
become an additional recrea-
tional area.

Martin said that though the
plan merited further discussion,
he would not recommend an-
other month delay in the demo-
lition of Forbes Field to the
University.

“If we stopped this whole
thing now,” said Martin, “I
can envision our sitting six
years from now in another room
like this one discussing the
same problems we're discussing
now.”.

At the suggestion of Robert.
Paternoster, Director of the
Department of City Planning
and moderator of the meeting,

Martin and community repre- "

sentatives agreed to set up a
meeting among spokesmen and
architects for the community
and the University.

Martin said that, should a
viable alternative to the Uni-
versity’s plan be reached, the
University could halt the demo-
lition process.

“We can stop the process
leading to the demolition of
Forbes Field at any time up
until the signing of the con-
tract," Martin said.. -

Martin estimated that no con-
tract would be signed for at
least two-four weeks.

The University’s Forbes,
Phase I project calls for erec-
tion of a building complex for
the School of Law and several
departments of the social sci-
ences on what is now the Forbes
Field site. Parking area beneath
the complex is also charted by
the Phase I plan.

Community objections to the
plan include the displacement
of residents and possible traffic
jams that Phase I could cause..

An alternative plan suggested
by the community was rejected
some weeks ago because it plan-
ned insufficient classroom
space and lacked a source of
subsidy.

Merit Aid Revised,Based On Need

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

Student leaders who desire
merit scholarships for their ser-
vices in the future will have to
meet the same financial re-
quirements as other aid recipi-
ents.

The Student Affairs Office
has announced that all under-
graduate financial aid will be
awarded on the basis of demon-
strated need. Currently, certain
positions of student leadership
guarantee merit scholarships.

In a written release, Student
Affairs said that. during the fall
and winter terms, student lead-
ers would not be given prefer-
ence in financial aid awards.

“It is the University's policy,”
reads the release, “that all un-
dergraduate University finan-
cial aid is awarded on the bas-
is of need as demonstrated
through submission of a Parent's
Confidential Statement or a
Student's Confidential State-
ment to the Student Aid Office.”.

The «statement also reported
that students whose University
responsibilities require them to

   

 

be on campus during the spring
and summer—Student Assodia-
tion (SA) members and publica-
tion editors, for example--would
if identified‘ by their advisors
and redommended by a student
staff committee. have their tui-
tion remitted, for the third term.

Sitting on the_ recommending
committee will be the Director
of Student Activities, Director
of Students Aid, and two stu-

dent representatives selected by

the Student Affairs

Committee.

Advisory

The new scholarship guide-
lines will take effect in the
spring of 1972. Those students
who have accepted posts for the
coming fall and winter terms
under the assumption that they
would be receiving merit assist-
ance will receive that assistance

until the expiration of their
terms..

The Student Affairs Office
cited “ . increased pressure

on student aid funds and lack
of a consistent policy regarding
salaries and scholarships for stu-
dents‘ participation in student
activities . .  as reasons for

  

the revamping .of
assistance program.

Director of Student Activities
Bill Markus said that the cur-
rent policy is thought unfair, in
that it rewards certain student

the merit

activities and not others.
“Where does one draw the
line?" Markus asked. “Who

can say whether one person is
contributing more than another
or whether that contribution is
more significant.” .

One area that the new assist-
ance policy may effect will be
student publications. Editors and
business managers of student
publications traditionally were
assured merit scholarships. Some
observers fear that, without the
lure of guaranteed scholarships,
publications will not attract
competent students for their top
positions.

Esther Kitzes, Assistant Di-
rector of Student Activities for
Publications. said that she dis-
agrees with some of the policy
revisions.

"I still strongly believe editors
and business managers should

 

be remunerated for their ser-
vices," she sald..

Kitzes said that student publi-
cations are “unique" because
they: service the entire Uni-
versity community; provide an
educational experience in the
absence of a journalism depart-
ment; provide a “lasting re-.
source” for the University, and
reflect in a way the quality of
the University.

“How can we equate the
services of the “Pitt News"
which serves the entire Univer-
sity community, with the activi-
ties of the Chess Club or the
Hiking Club?" asked Kitzes,.

Markus said he could not pre-
dict the ramisications of the
new policy on student publica-
tions. The six student publica-
tions at the University The Owl,
Ideas and Figures, The Polaris,
The Pitt Capsule, The Sky-
scraper Engineer, The Course
Evaluation, and The Pitt News..

Salaries for the Pitt News
staff and proposed wages for
Student Association
would not be affected by the
policy changes. According to

_ the release, salaries may be paid

members _

if  the source of funds
utilized are student activities
fees, or the monies raised by
the student organization, and
the arrangement has the recom-
mendation of the faculty or
staff advisors and the approval
of the Student Association.”

RSA salaries, if approved, will
be financed by student activi-
ties fees, and the salaries for

“Pitt News” staffers comes
from advertising revenue. .
The amended policy will

also leave unaltered the status

of Resident Assistants and
athletes. Resident Assistants,
considered special employees

by the Housing Office, receive

free room and board for their

services.

Athletes will continue to be-_

awarded financial aid irrespec-
tive of need.

‘Pretty Maids In A Row’ Better Shelved  

by CINDY MORGAN
Entertainment Editor
Screen writer and producer
Gene Roddenberry should bury
his head at the bottom of a pile
of dusty Star Trek manuscripts

for his latest film, Pretty

Maids All in a Row.
Pretty Maids deals with a

psychopathic guidance-counsel-

or- athletic coach-assistant prin-
cipal (Rock Hudson) who puts
the moves on every attractive
highschool girl in the vicinity
and is certainly much in demand
as the man on campus.

No one is safe from this lech-
erous, ill-fated Romeo, includ-
ing Betty Smith a pretty young
teacher played weakly by Angie
Dickinson.

The guy really has it made;
he has a plush office, complete
with bar; a door which locks,
and a switch which lights up a

400 smithfield street, downtown

red “testing” signoutside his
door to let everyone know he
must not be disturbed. (Import-
ant testing is going on inside.).

He has a beautiful (wife and
a lavish home, of course. but he

SALE Oll l(l.|l

Model 11w. is now $179.95
Model 26 is now $229.95

_During the recent (and first) KLH sale many people were disappointed that it did not
include the outstanding models 11W and 26. Well their wish has been answered with
savings of $30 and 3340. These famous compact stereo systems are complete with speakers,
ampliﬁers, and phonographs, but no PM or A.\I. They were designed for people who
are interested in playing‘ records and not the radio. Yet FBI or tape can be added later
if you change your mind. The ll-w is the non-portable, but equally compact, walnut ver-
sion of the famous model 11, which (if you remember your Kl.History) was the world’s
ﬁrst high performance portable stereo phonograph. The model 26 is sort of a big brother
to the 11-W. lts, amplifier has double the Dower, its speakers are larger, and (if
possible) it sounds even better, particularly in a large room that you want to fill
with concert level sound. Either stereo system makes the perfect QUALITY gift for
the graduate. Your personal KLH system will be completely checked out and adjusted

The remainder of the film
focuses on a 17-year old high-

he doesn't have any. So the good
counselor promptly fixes him
up with the teacher lady..

least. John David Carson deliv-
ers perhaps the films strongest,

this is only his first movie.

The ‘movie is an extension of
director Roger Vadim. the man

SST to Falter or ‘Fly Once More

By MARC KILLER. .

Environmentalists, economists, and leading
consumer advocates saw the awsome powers of a
determined President last Wednesday, May 12.
A surprise vote on the SST was called on the
floor of the House. ‘

It was recognized that the SST could rise
again, even after Congress had laid it to rest, if
some future Congress_ decided it to be an econo-
mic of political necessity. However, it was not.

I -expected to happen so soon.

Due to the wrath and determination of Pre-

T sident Nixon and House Majority Leader Gerald

Ford a new bill permitting governmental appro-

I priations of $85.3 million was introduced in or-

der to continue development and eventual pro-

duction of two prototypes of the controversial,

plane. Ford conceded that this didn’t give op-
ponents a chance to firm up their ranks. ‘

A last ditch effort by Environmental Action,

’ Inc’. and the Friends of The Earth to notify all

U.S. Congressmen of the surprise roll call vote
helped alert many, but failed to get in tough
with all those needed to defeat the proposai..

Unfortunately, the forces led by big busi-
.ness and the White House won this round by a
slim margin of 204-199. In the previous Con-
gressional vote in March. the house voted to de-
feat the SST by a larger margin of 215-204.

 War ‘Kills,-
Continues

by MICHAEL SIMON ’

Those people that criticized Mayday perhaps,
do not realize the desperate necessity of an im-
mediate end to the Vietnam war. In any other
sense of the word, the United States is literally
committing genocide in Vietnam.

The Vietnamese, both North and South report-
edly have approximately two out of -six of their

V children born deformed. This is due to the thal-

idomide in one of the many chemicals the U.S.
is using in Vietnam.

Thalidomide, formerly a widely used tran-
quilizer in the United States. was banned be-
cause it invariably causes mutations in the child-
ren of mothers who use the drug during preg-
nancy.

As if this isn’t enough, two and one half

. times the bomb tonnage dropped on Hiroshima

is used ‘by the U. S. in Indochina.
Aside from massacring Vietnamese, regardless

“of political affiliation, (as if it mattered any-

way), the land is being scorched so badly that it
cannot be used for agricultural purposes. Since
the country depends on its crops, this will even-
tually cause an economic disaster, when the
United States ’ if finished in Vietnam..

Nixon, however, promises an end to the war,
and says he is withdrawing troops. Someday,
after_more die, and more destruction this may
happen. Until that faraway day, the president
has asked Congress for an increase in the De-
fense Budget of eighty million dollars to be speci-

gifically spent in Indochina, and the Middle East.

It is clear that the President really doesn‘t
want to end the war. He does as he pleases and
that is the way the country is run, Look at the
SST, Nixon after unsuccessful attempts. finally
got a$85.3 million dollar appropriations bill for

« his albatross to pass the House of Representa-

tives.

Nixon, evidently doesn’t think that the en-
vironment might be crippled as a result of the
noise, thermal and gaseous pollution of the SST.

. He also doesn’t think that we should leave Viet-

nam. ,
After reading this column, one might think

. that my reasoning is influenced by my emo-

tions, and therefore it is not valid. reasoning.
Emotions, however is the one thing Nixon can't
stop,’ as he has triedto stop everything else.

l

Following the Houses vote in favor of com-
pletion of the SST prototypes, the Chairman of
the Board of Boeing Corporation -— the company
that has the contract to build the SST — said that
for Boeing to complete the SST project as of this
date, it would take as much as a “billion dollars.”

The National Coalition Against The SST has
_ regrouped in an effort to defeat this plane once

and for all..

The $85.3 million funding proposal has been
scheduled on the floor of the U.S. Senate on
Wednesday, May 19. We are confident of vic-
tory in the Senate. If the SST is defeated in the
Senate it must go before a Senate-House con-
ference committee and then before another roll
call vote in both the House and Senate. During
this time lobbyists will have to once again zero

in on the SST.

According to the Los Angeles Times, which

supported the SST, “the aircraft became a sym-
bol to a lot of people -— a symbol of resistance to

g the so called ‘military-industrial complex,’ a
symbol of resistance to technological spoilation
of the environment, and even a symbol of dis-
taste for President Nixon.” .

Thus we see. even if one considers the de-
feat of the SST only a dramatic sign of the need

to change our current national priorities, why

we must bind together the strongest lobbying ef-
fort in

Let's show that there is a greater need to
solve other greater social and economic prob-
lems such as pollution. better housing, educa-
tional opportunities, and mass transit. Let's show
the White House that if the public does not

Budget Structure Circular

by CAROLE COVAL

Despite initial optimism, the
Allocations Committee and the
budget referral committee of
the Student Association are suf-
fering problems similar to those
of “real life politics. ”

Even though serious attempts
have been made to make the
Allocations Committee an apoli-
tical structure by assigning mem-
bership through an interview-
ing procedure although a “rati-
fying committee" was set up to
check and balance the budget-
ing procedure, a gigantic bug
in the structure is impeding the
allocation process.

The bug in the works is com-
monly known as power..

By constitutional law, the
ratifying committee receives
budget recommendations from
the Allocations Committee. In
the case of extreme objection,
the budget is sent back to Allo-
cations for revision.

If no common ground is work-
able, the Committees, Academic,
and Program Commissioners
plus five members of the Social
Commission vote. The Social
Commissioner may vote in case
of atie.

Unfortunately, it seems to‘
some that the ratifying com-

Non-Controversial Decisions Not Referred

mittee should necessarily func-
tion as a rubber stamp. Per-
haps this stance comes from a
fear that the Commissioners
would have too much power
withaveto.

Regardless of V the power
threat, the Commissioners do
have a responsibility to the stu-
dent body to produce what they
have promised during their cam-
paigns. This responsibility means
reinforcing budget
for programs they have promis-
ed. This, of course, may mean
overruling the recommenda-

tion of an Allocations Commit- .

I88. .

The activities fee is a re-
source which is supposed to be
returned to the students in the
form of services, activities. and
programs. It should not, how-
ever, ‘be dispensed to “every
worthy cause" but to those ser-
vices, activities and into those
programs that benefit most stu-
dents. '

Whothen should have the fin-

al say-so? Elected officials, or”

un-elected ones?

The power problem is even
more perplexing when you con-
sider that the Social Commis-
sion budget must be reviewed
by an aquiesent body, after the
initial recommendation by the

allotments -

Allocations Committee. Since
student opinion has already been
tapped and the results show
demand for more outstanding
groups, dances, and movies, a
budget submitted to program
these events will be a priority
within the Social Commission..

If The Allocations Committee
trims the budget. they will be
passing programatic judgement
upon campaign promises and
student opinion.

What, then, will occur?

Without outside interven-
tion, the Social Commission’s
budget will pass according to
the integrity of the ratifying
committee.

With the event of outside
intervention and the Social Com-
mission budget is trimmed, who
receives the ‘complaint of the
student?.

But then, who should decide
on the validity of the entire
Student Association operating
budget. At best, the existing
structure allows the SA to rati-
fy its own budget, an undemo-
cratic procedure. ’

Much like the “harsh real
world” the system is all too
circular for a healthy working
relationship within the Uni-
versity Community.

3,245’ Kan Review 524 56’ Action

Editor:

I wish to clarify an FAS juris-
dictional matter mentioned in

your news article in the May ‘

11 issue concerning last Thurs-
day's meeting of FASC.

Your article quoted an FASC
member to the effect that the
decision of the Council in en-
dorsing the “40-60 rule” does
not require the approval of the
FAS. This statement is not un-
conditionally correct.

The Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences, charged by the Board of
Trustees with jurisdiction over
curricula, has delegated cer-
tain powers to its Councils,
including CASC and FASC,
but the full faculty has the re-
serve power to review any action
of any of its Councils.

Such a review could occur
within the format of a full FAS
meeting. In principle, any

., action of any of the Councils

can be submitted to a full FAS

meeting called by a petition of

forty members of the faculty
presented to 'the Dean within

twenty days after the action of

that Council has been” reported

 

in the FAS GAZETTE.

In other words, the FAS does
review all actions of its Councils,
either by specific action taken
in a full FAS meeting, or by
allowing the actions of the Coun-
cils, appropriately published in
the GAZETTE, to remain un-
chauenged.

What the FASC decided at its
May 6 meeting was not to take
the initiative to place a review
of the “40-60 proposal" on the
agenda of an FAS meeting. FASC
could not have ruled out the
possibility of review initiated
by members of FAS.

gage 0/
0%M.”w.047/

In deciding whether to place
review of Council actions on the
agenda of a full faculty meet-
ing, FASC tries to predict whe-

ther substantial , inumbers of

a

the faculty will want to exer-
cise their right of review in a
full meeting, or whether the
faculty, for the most part, pre-
fers that the matter be dealt
with directly by the Council.
In principle, the judgment of
FASC may turn out wrong.

What FASC may regard as

relatively non-controversial may
be perceived by large numbers
of faculty as indeedgbeing con-
troversial; but this has not yet
turned out to be the case. There
has not been a single instance
to date in which the method of
petition has been used to call

for faculty review in a matter_

where FASC guessed that it
would not be called for.

In summary. your reporter
may turn out to be right in that
FAS did not, take a positive
step to endorse the Council
recommendation. In principle,
however, the ultimate authority
still resides in the full faculty.

Sincerely yours,
Jerome L. Rosenberg
Dean, FAS

Editor.

To date. the major source of
information on Student Associ-
ation activities has been a May
4 Pitt News issue which announc-
ed the decision of the four Com-
missioners to give themselves
retroactive salaries and to raise
the student activities fee.

Since this report appeared.
severely conflicting reports
have been emanating from vari-
ous sources within the Univer-
sity regarding’ the present status
of these and other proposals.
As a result, many students at
this University are confused as
to the operation and goals of
the Student Association com-
missioners.

Therefore, we request in the

interests of all students at the
University an explicit statement

 

by the commissioners, individu-
ally or in toto, that will suffici-
ently answer the following
questions:

1. The fee—Is a
raise contemplated? When?
How much? Why? Who will

be involved in the decision?
2. Salaries for Student Asso-
ciation officers—are they con-
templated? Will they be retro-
active? Will they be based on

activities

need? Who will determine the
salary schedule?
3. Funding for SA activities

and student organizations—what
percentage of the student activi-
ties fee is being requested by
the Student Association? To
what extent do the commission-
ers wish to extend their author-
ity over presently autonomous
student organization programs?

Associate Sports Editor.

For the Panther baseball team,
the past weekend was simply
‘perfect.’

In two days, they racked up
four victories, including a twin-

bill sweep of Westminster,
and a double win in the first
annual Turnpike Tournament

to come home with the trophy.

To top everything off. Mike
Fedoris, a husky sophomore
righthander hurled a perfect
seven inning game against West-
minister on Friday afternoon.

Fedoris’ remarkable pitching
performance marked the first
time in Coach Bobby Lewis’
16 year career at Pitt that a
Panther hurler did not allow
anyone ' to reach base.

Only three Titan batters
managed to hit the ball to the
outfield, and ten of them struck
out swinging at Fedoris’ blis-
tering fastball.

pull through,” remarked Coach

-_-‘Frail; Webster in regard to his tennis team’s two losses last week-
iend. The 17-0 California squad crushed Pitt 8-1 and Westminster,
h with only one loss this season, then went ahead to take a close 6-3

 Schwartz and Mike O’Loughlin'respectively, didn’t have their usual

Schwartz’s opponent came back after losing the first four

his opponent in a . “real fine

match,’.’ 6-2, 6-2.

Jorge Gutierrez played against
a “boy who just hit better than
he.” to quote Webster. Gutierrez
lost number four singles 6-2,
6-2.

.After a struggle in the _fifth
singles match, sophomore Les
Abromovitz won with a final
scorezof 1-6, 6-2, 6-3, making
the . score 3-2 Westminister:

In the final singles compe-
tition, Tom McKnight, stayed
with his opponent but dropped
the match 6-3, 6-4. “Tom, as
the other boys have, has been
playing better as the season
progresses,” praised ,‘ Webster.

0’Loug/hlin and Wood could,
according to Webster, have
taken first doubles if only they

_had a break. They lost 6-4, 6-3.

Then in the number two doubles
spot the team of Schwartz and
Gutierrez, who had a two-meet
streak, just couldn’t
get started, and lost 6-1, 6-3.
“They didn’t play very well,”
remarked Webster with regret.
However, the third doubles
team consisting of Ed Kline
and Jon Flint picked up two
wins in a row defeating West-

minster 8-6,, 6-4 and Cali-

fornia 6-4, 6-1 for the only
point in that meet. L

‘‘After- playing three close

sets in almost every meet this
season they were bound to win,”

’ Webster commented. “Ed had a
back injury last year and has

just loosened up, “Webster con-
tinued. “Now he is playing up
to his capabilities.

Jon’s serve is stronger and
they’re playing together has
finally come along.” '

The Brook’s brother’s, who
have qualified for the NAIA,
sparkled for California in one
and two singles. Webster sum-
med up last weeks competition
by terming it as “rough.”

The team will travel to Grove
City on Wednesday since the
meet with the Grovers was
rained out last week. “They-are
a real good team." Webster

said, ,“Their only, loss. was to?

The only difficult fielding
chance that arose during the
masterpiece occurred in the
bottom of the seventh. The
Westminister leadoff man
blooped a fastball into short
right field, but Bob Solonickne
made a diving catch at the
foul line for the putout.

Soly also made an important
contribution to the scoring at-
tack in the game as be belted
a two-run homer nto the lake
beyond the left field fence in
the seventh. Added to two other
previous Panther tallies, the
insurance runs gave the‘ squad
a4-0 win.

In the first game of the
doubleheader against Westmin-
ister, Rich Muse pitched a two-
hitter to lead the club to a 5-1
win. A walk to Solonickne in
the first inning followed by a
booming double by Terry
Stokes gave the teamits first
run in three games.

Ironically, Muse’s perfor-
mance in the late innings of the
first -game gave Fedoris the op-
portunity to pitch the perfect
second game. Coach Lewis was

‘ready to lift Muse. in the fourth

inning in favor of Fedoris, but

Rich got out of a jam and je-

tired to the last nine batters
in arow.

On Saturday at Cleveland,
the mitters unleashed a 13 hit
barrage against a highly rated
Detroit team and moved to the
finals of the tourney with an
11-’? win. ‘

Past records notwithstanding,
the mitters jumped on Detroit’s
ace, Dave Frezza, for six runs
in the first and four more in the
third to knock him out of the
contest. Three of the third inn-
ing runs came via a Ken Macha
cloug-over the left field fence.

In the third inning, Panther
catcher Guy Caparelli dislocat-
ed a finger on a foul tip, but
he showed no il1"effects in the
fourth as he clobbered his first

home run of the year to straight- .

away center. Lewis decided to
replace Cap after that and Bill
Schmitke caught the remainder
of the afternoon.

Panther hurler Mike Niccols,
who always seems blessed with
a comfortable margin, allowed
three earned runs in the first
six frames. In the seventh, four
unearned runs crossed the plate
before Niccols struggled to quell
the rally.

In the tourney championship
against Cleveland State, who
beat Youngstown 3-0, both teams
scored single runs in the first
inning.

The Vikings gained the lead

in the third, but the Panthers-

tied it in the fifth. An unusual
chain of events led to the Pan-

. With one out, Bob Livingston
walked. Paul Quarantillo, at-
tempting to hunt him to second,
popped the ball right back to
the pitcher, who fired it to first
hoping to double up Livingston.
The umpire signalled “You’re
out-no safe.”

Instead of pinch hitting for
Sylanski, Lewis changed his
mind and played a hunch and
allowed his pitcher to bat. Liv-
ingston stole second, and Sylan-
ski promptly doubled him home

for the winning margin.
Sylanski retired the Vikings
in order in the seventh, and

when Harry Pardini hauled in ‘J D’
a long fly to end the game, it-
concluded a perfect series for
the jubilant team and coach.

Tracksters’ PS U Win

by VINCE DiNARDO.

A swiftly improving Steve
Hein, a little intrasquad rival-
ry, and the usual‘-consistent per-
formances of some other Pitt
athletes combined to give the
Pitt track team 11 first places
in the Pennsylvania State‘Cham-
pionship meet at Penn State
last Saturday.

Hein, who according to assist-
ant coach Don Mollenauer is
“starting to come,” won both
the shotput ‘and the discus
throws. His 52 foot 10 inch
heave in the shotput was also
his best throw to date. In the
discus Hein won with a toss of

158 feet. Tom Banks finished
fourth behind Hein in both
events.

An unusual turn of events left
John Wilborne the winner in
the high jump. All the jumpers
managed to clear the six foot
four inch mark in the jump and
the winner was chosen on the
basis of fewer misses. Terry
Thompson, also a Pitt jumper,
also cleared 6’4” but placed
fourth.

  
  
  
   
       
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
  
  
       
    
  
  

 
  
  
  

Despite a home run blast
by Skip Rose, tighfrlefense
proved the deciding factor
as Pi Lam downed Delta
Sig, 3-2 last week. Delta
Sig trailed the whole game.

Paced by Dan Lynn’s two
round trippers and triple,
the Riff Raff buried Catch
73, 15-4. Lloyd Rodgers also
homered for the Riff Raff
and Dave Havern rapped out
three hits for the second con-
secutive ‘time this season.

The high jumping spot on the
team is up for grabs and Wol-
borne and Thompson have been
vying for the top spot all along.

“I think there is a little
friendly rivalry going on be-
tween the two athletes,” admit-
ted Mollenauer.

Bill Rea and Dan Kouvolo
turned in their usual fine per-
formances for Pitt to add to the
runaway.

Kouvolo had his best per-
formance of the season in a
245 foot hurl. Rea again won
both the triple and long jumps.
Rea jumped 22 feet 11 inches.
in the long jump and 47 feet
in the triple.

In the running events, the
tracksters continued their domin-
ance.

Smittie Brown ran 22 flat in
the 200 but was tied for first
place. Brown also anchored the
mile relay team, which won its
race, with a blistering fast

“When Smittie took the baton,
he was about a yard behind,”
said ‘Mollenauer. He won by
seven yards.” .

Mike Shurko, whose brother
has decided to come to Pitt,
won his second consecutive
stepplechase run. Shurko’s im-
proved his time by eight sec-
onds with his 8:58.7. Last week
in the Pitt Invitational Shurko
ran 9:06.2. 5 ’

Dorel Watley didn’t compete
because of a pulled muscle in
his leg. “He was recovered,
but we thought it wise not to
run him,” Mollenauer said.

Ted Bobby after running 48.6
in the mile relay, developed
soreness in his leg and with-

drew from ’ the intermediate
hurdles.
The tracksters will face
