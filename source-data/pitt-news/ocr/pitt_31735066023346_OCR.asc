Stravv Poll! Shows Half Of StudentBody Opposes
  Draft Registration ; 28 Percent Favors Sign-Up

By WALTER R. WATSON.

Pitt News Staff Writer ‘ »
In a recent. straw poll, 50 percent

against reinstating draft registra-
tion.
The pollster asked three ques-

V tions. The first question was used
in the tabulation of student opin-‘

ion, and the remaining two
-surveyed students’ attitudes on the
possibilities of a draft.

The following three questions
were asked: ‘

—“In the event that you’ll have

‘to register for the draft, will you be

for it, against it, or undecided

about registration for the draft?”;
——“In the event that women will

‘- be part of the registration for the

 

draft, will you be for it, against it,
or undecided?”, and -

“If you were served a draft

I Pakistan.

notice, would you a) serve your
country, b) take evasive action such.

‘ as card burning, joining anti-draft

organizations or going into hiding,
or c) be undecided as to what course

 of action you will take when issued

a draft notice?” '

Most of the students who were

' against ‘draft registration had strong

convictions for being against it. n

- lvlary Kandray, a sophomore, of-
fered her thoughts. -

“I’m,not for the draft registra-
tion at this time,” she said. “But if
Congress says that there’ll be a
registration, I don’t_think it will do
much good to argue or protest. I_
don’t think Afghanistan is impor-
tant enought to send troops into
I think we should see
what the Russians will do next
before we take any drastic steps.”

”I’m totally opposed,” said
James Gilkey a sophomore. “I
don’t think the government has a’
claim on an individual’s right to
choose what his action will be.”

“I just have a problem with the
United States going to war,” said
CAS student Holly Martin. “I

don’t believe they’ve put enough ef- '
_ fort into spending on domestic

resources, like on solar energy.”

“I don’t think the young people

' of America should have to pay for

the misappropriating of ‘funds by
the government,” Martin added.

A sense of obligation was evident
in the 28 percent that favored the

return of draft registration.

“As far as I’m concerned,” said
freshman-Mary Ann Griffey, “it
wouldn’t bother me as long as I’m
not in combat. I wouldn’t mind,

working in the medical field of the

service; I’m ready trained in the
medical field. Besides, before I ot

a job, I was considering enlisting.” _

Junior Dung Tran, a foreign stu-
dent put himself in the place of

Americans who are facing_a possi-
-ble draft. ‘ ~

“IfI had to go out and fight, I’d
be upset, but I'd go. If I were an
American citizen, I’d think I should
go, that’s an obligation,” he said.

“There are a lot of people who’ve
served this count-ry in the past to
make it possible for us to be here,”
said Ron Posteraro,’a freshman. “I.
believe I could do that for future
generations.”

Another freshman, who chose to
be anonymous, said he favored the
registration of men and women. ' V

Student Government Presi-
dent Bill Abraham will travel to-
day to Washington to meet with
President Carter and several of
his top aides to discuss domestic
and foreign affairs, as "well as
the reinstitution of the draft.

Abraham received" the invita-
tion, along with student body—

presidents from major univer-
sities across the nation to par-
ticipate in a daylong intensive,
briefing conference featuring

‘sessions with‘ national security

adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski,

and a mid-day luncheon with

Carter, , ‘ , .
“I feel proud in beingchosen

Abraham Discusses Foreign Policy WithCarter

to represent the university at
such an affair and am very im-
pressed with this action by the
White House,” Abraham said
last night befo_re departing for
Washington.

“It seems that right now when
some feel that the hostages in’

. and some of his top domestic

Irangmav be released within the
next 48 hours it is a volatile time
in Washington, Abraham said,
-“We will be sitting there tomor-
row listening to the President

and foreign advisors while a
decision of world-wide impor-
tance may be in the making.” '

SGS Student    I
Appointed To    

Trustees Post  

By GEORGE EVANS
Pitt News Staff Writer C

Torn Hajduk, a_ junior in Pitt’s  I H

School of General Studies, has been
appointed to the university’s Com-S
monwealth Board of Trustees by
Governor Dick Thornburgh.

Hajduk was one of three univer-

sity students nominated for the '
position by a studentsearch com- 
mittee and the Boardnof Trustees. ‘ '
, The board also chose Grant Acker- I

man, a graduate student, and

Walter Burke, a College of Arts and . 
“  Sciences student, ’ to‘be -considered?’-3"

by Thornburghi for the position.”

According to Pat Beck, one ‘of’.
the two SGS students on the student

search committee, “We were look--  .

ing for someone familiar with stu-
dent needs, someone who could
keep in touch with the various fac-
tions within the university.”

Following four prelir\ninary inter-

views here in Pittsburgh, the three 9" '
, nominees traveledto Harrisburg for '

interviews and further screening.

On Tuesday, Feb. 6, Hajduk was

notified of his appointment by the . 
_governor’s office. All thatis need,-_.  b
ed is Senate confirmation before the _ ‘ _ ~

position belongs officially to Ha-
jduk. ‘ _ I
When asked of his reaction to the
appointment he said, “The other ‘
two people were quite good and I -
am ﬂattered.”_ .

Beck was satisfied with Hajduk’s ‘

appointment. “I was really pleased.
because Tom is the second SGS
student to serve on the board,” she
said.

Hajduk will be replacingsheila '
Rathke,. who is‘ also an SGS stu-
dent. He will be one of 36 voting

. members onthe Board of Trustees -

and will serve a four-year term.

While commenting _on his new
position Hajduk said, “I view this j
as a learning experience and as an
opportunity to serve the students’
and the university.” I V

Hailing from South Hills, Ha- _
jduk is currently vice president of
the Evening Student Cabinet, a

member of the Senate Operations _ "

Committee, and public relations-

By COLLEN MORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

Questions regarding university
tenure procedures were answered by
Ierome L. Rosenberg, dean of the
Faculty of Arts and. Sciences, in a
recent interview with The Pitt
News. Information concerning

A ' tenure was also obtained through

the faculty newspaper, the Gazette.
According to the Gazette, tenure

. is not a reward for past services but
a kind of contract. a lifetime of

security’ in exchange for a lifetime
of continued creative scholarship.
Excellence in research should not

excuse incompetence in teaching or ‘

teaching that can make no claim to
excellence. V

“Quantitative measures of pro-
ductivity and popularity, however
useful, are no substitutes for
qualitative judgments,” according
to Rosenberg.

The first step in receiving tenure
is an apoointment that takes the
review of the _candidate and for-

Draft Regiisfration:
50 Percent Say No

(Continued from Page I)

“I think. it’s good to draft them
(women). But they’re not going to
fight. They’re not going anywhere;
they’ll probably be behind some
desk or something. I don’t see why
they’re crying so much. If I were
drafted, I’d go,” the student said.

Suheil Nassar, a graduate student
in industrial engineering, had an
alternate solution to the way the
draft would be administered.

“/1 think if the reason for register-
ing-people for‘ the draft is for na-
tional security, rather than for the
national good, less people would be
against it. Also, they should force
American citizens to go fight if they
aren’t willing,” said Nassar.

. “The government should take 50
percent of the people presently in
the service and send them to combat
duty. Those men and women who
are making careers in the Army,
Navy and the rest should be used to
fight a war, because it’s their
chosen job. I wouldn’t mind serv-
ing~here in some capcity, but just
like the many people affected by the-

reglstration, I’m~ first concerned
with what’s in my best interest.

“Working part-time here in the
Army should be considered an
honorable service, and one of the
options allowed if we must register
for the draf ,"‘ Nassar said.

Those who were undecided com-
posed 22 percent of the 70 students
questioned by the pollster. Most
showed mixed emotions and anxiety
about the future should they be in-
cluded in the registration.

wards this with the chairman’s
recommendation to the Dean of
FAS for action.

Secondly, a dossier which in-
cludes a summery of professional
activities including research,
publication, attendance at con-
ferences, presentation of papers,
professional recognition, etc., is
compiled, attesting to a teacher's
excellence, Rosenberg said.

Next on the list is the third-year
review, which is not for those who

vices will not be continued. If,
however, a third-year-review is con-
ducted, the committee of tenured
faculty expresses their recommen-
dation to the dean of FAS.

A tenure council elects from its
members a selection committee,
composed of two representatives
from each department. If the
materials that have been provided
to the review committee are lacking,
the materials are returned, to the
dean, and further discussion on the

case is postponed until the deﬁcien-

If the faculty member is rejected
for tenure, according to Rosenberg,
there are two routes to take in an
appeals process:

'—-Ask for a reconsideration of the
case by the Dean of FAS in 30 days,
and "
'—E1ect not to ask for reconsidera-
{ion but immediately request that

Pitt’s Informal Program is spon-
soring “Polish Super Sunday” this
weekend from 3-5 p.m. in the Com-
mons Room of the Cathedral of
Learning.

“We would love to have students
there,” said Ellen Caldwell, com-
munity relations coordinator for
PIP. “It is a fun way to spend a
Sunday.”

Events will include a perfor-
mance by the Thilaret dance group,

A an -extensive slide show by Roger

Conant, who recently traveled to

Poland, and a pierogi-making
demonstration by Stephani Matula,
one of the best-known Polish cooks
in Pittsburgh.

The celebration is free, but there
will be a small charge for food and
beverages. .

This is the second of three Super
Sunday celebrations to be spon-
sored by PIP this year. The final
one will be ‘an ‘‘India Super Suri-
day” to be held on March 2.

Say,Good Night

The temporary publication suspension of the Night
Times, — the School of - General Studies student
newspaper, is an unsettling occurrence.

Reasons for the publication’s problems, according
to the SGS Cabinet Council, include inadequate
ﬁscal management, funding problems and dif-

V ficulties in production.

There is a discrepancy, however, concerning how
7 the paper managed to get into this difficult situation.

._/ ‘

The newspaper’s management alleges that it warned
the council of impending financialproblems in
September of last year. The council maintains that
there‘a?e no records of these warnings and that it was
assuredthat the Night Times could publish the entire
year with the funds it was allocated.

Rational thinking leads one to believe that the
newspaper’s management would be insane to allow
the paper to die. It is much more believable, then, to
assume that the newspaper’s management did in fact
warn the council. Like many governments, the Coun-.
cil may have reacted slowly to the situation, hoping
the problem would just go away.

Regardless of who is at fault, the SGS students will
suffer from the newspaper’s temporary demise.
Without the Night Times, those students will be in
the dark concerning what is. happening in their
school. ' ‘

The core of the problems incurred by, the Night

Times lies in its role in SGS. It is currently controlled

finanacially by the council and, in reality, serves as a
public relations sheet for the group and other SGS
organizations. Once this situation is changed,
perhaps the future of the newspaper will look a bit
brighter. ’

Part of the role of a newspaper anywhere is to be a
watchdog of government, to assure that the consti-
tuency of the government does not get a raw deal. It
is difficult, to understand how the Night Times could
fill this role if financial control is held by the very
government it is ‘supposed to watch,

_ I @112 Iﬁitt News

Page 6—Friday, February 15, 1980

Instead of being allocated a yearly sum to operate,
the Night Times should be given a permanent con-
tract, guaranteeing it enough funds to prevent it from
folding. In that way, editorial control, both overt
and covert, could not be exercised by the council.

Another problem lies in the production of the
newspaper.- The Night Times/staff does not typeset
or proofread the material contained in the newspaper
before it is printed. Instead, the paper’s typesetting

is done by an outside company, which leads to more

errors in the newspaper’s copy. A solution to this
problem might be to purchase a used typesetting
machine so that the Night Times staff would have
more control over its final product.

Better internal financial monitoring through a

restructuring of the Night Times staff would also pre- »

vent various problems. Currently, the publication’s
bills are paid by a secretary working out of the coun-
cil office, according to the Night Times management.

Thus, the newspaper’s staff must depend on a third
party rather than handling bills on its own.-

A special review committee, to study those and
other problems, has been set up by the council.
Although obviously a bit late to prevent the paper’s

current publication problems, perhaps the committee _
. will find avenues to prevent future failures.

At any rate, the SGS students deserve their own
newspaper. We hope the council’s review committee
will lay‘the groundwork for a sound publication,
founded on the same principals that other
newspapers exist under.

Televisionis ’Shocki,ng Copobi|i’ry"'o Path to World Peace

By NICK ARNETT

Pitt News Staff Writer

If war should break out, we can
"have live television coverage from
A the battlefield. “TV Guide” called
-it television’s “most shocking
« capability,” but left open the ques-
tion of its morality. I think it would
be moral, because what you do

know can’t hurt you.
The more done by the news

_ media to shrink this world, the

more they foster a global integra-
‘-tion, which is the only path I see to
world peace. - Environmentalists
and others ho promote such a
world-view ften use a’ photograph
of the earth irom the moon. lt"‘s a
breathtaking view because we see
mankind as an integrated group, a
collective. The photograph, unlike
‘a drawing, lends a realism we’ve
never seenbefore.
The smaller our world appears,

‘ the more we can believe in the

human race as an integrated _grou_p.
I don’t_mean -we should strive to

throw away individual identity—it
will survive—but couple it with an
awareness of our integrity.
Woodstock demonstrated the
power of peace" which can result
from a balance of individual identi-
ty and group integration. Faced

‘with an unexpected overflow, the

system collapsed. The institutions
in which we,normally have
faith—grocer,y stores, police,
hospitals, even bathrooms-—could

not handle the crowd. Lives were ’

endangered.

Each person at Woodstock was
forced to take care of his own life.
Anarchy threatened but didn’t
materialize. Each person took
charge of himself. People held their
lives in their own hands in a way
few of us have, unless we’ve been
lost in the wilderness.

However, unlike the woods,
Woodstock was densely populated.
Each person looking after himself
could see thousands of others doing
the same. Though each had to

assert his independence, there was a
sense of integrity resulting from a
common goal—survival.

I wish I had been there to feel the
joy of being able to simultaneously
assert my individuality and identity
with an immense group. That's real
power—the power which comes
from being an individual, as well as
the power of being a united group.

Ultimate anarchy--nucle_ar‘war--is
threatening once again. The Middle
East is becoming the focus of
confrontation, but it can become a
point of salvation, thanks to
technology. When live television
can bring Afghanistan to,our living
rooms, we can’t as easily distinguish
‘us’ from ‘them.’ I

Vietnam was called the first ‘liv-
ing room war,’ but news was, not
immediate. It took up to twenty-
four hours to reach our screens.

were in our front yard.
Afghanistan is in our front yard,
just as it" is in Russia’s. I’ve heard
students say they won’t fight the
Russians until they see MIGs over
America or Russian soldiers in
America's streets. I won’t wait for
the enemy to get here, because if

peace if threatened anywhere, it’s A
I threatened everywhere. This world

isn’t so big.
I’m not eager to kill for the
United States government. In past

wars, people rightly wondered when‘

it was proper to kill _out of
patriotism. They were morally cor-
rect, because at that time, our na-
tion’s identity was most important.
The confusion of Vietnam demon-
strated that’s_ no longer true.

Things have changed around here.
Global integrity has become more
important than patriotic sovereign-
ty. Watergate and other scandals
have destroyed our faith in the na-

I'm not willing to die for my
country out of patriotism, but I’ll

  “Does Columnist Really Know What

In the three recent issues of
The Pitt News, Mr. Nick Arnett has
consistantly made a fool of himself,
and made me question the degree of

validity of The ,Pitt News as a’

responsible publication. True, col-
umnists are not always the most in-
telligent people around, but at least
some of them back up their com-
ments with some sort of journalistic
poise. This is one area in which
Arnett is weak. His column, thus
far, aids in turning The Pitt News

Civilization
On Its Way

Down the Drain

During my undergraduate years
as ‘a political science major at Pitt, I
developed a theory that the United
States had learned its lesson in Viet-
nam; that it would be a long time
before we would let ourselves be
pushed into a war and if we did,
there would be no one left to
theorize about another war.

Never underestimate someone’s
foolishness. With the renewed talk
of registration, my theory and,
perhaps civilization, is on its way
down the drain. Of course we're on-
ly talking about registration, but it
seems clear to me that the inherent
purpose of registration is ' in

facilitating the draft. Surely no 0ne/ _

believes that we are accomplishing
anyt-hing by threatening the Soviet
Union with registration. ‘
Everyone said that it would be a
long time before anyone forgot
Vietnam. Seven years doesn’t seem
like a very long time to me. Shall we
fight another limited, unending war
for the next fifteen years or would it

be better if we went all out and end-
ed ‘_‘everything” right now? The
world powers are getting restless.
There is no ominous threat
shrouding the world at this point
but I’m sure that if they try real
hard, the “super governments? can
create something. I was always
taught that truly powerful people
didn’t have to flex their muscles;
that they couldn’t be controlled by
the actions of others. This is what
we are doing.

Where shall we have this war?
How about having this one in
Moscow? No, I guess not. They're
pretty busy with the summer Olym-
pics and everything. We wouldn’t
want to be an inconvenience. How
about here? “Not in our country,
you don’t!” Well, I guess we’ll have
to go somewhere else to have it.
How about Afghanistan? No,
they're pretty busy, too. The next
time those people build a country,
they sould be more particular about

a location._ How about Vietnam?‘

Never mind, I forgot we were just
there. Wouldn’t want to'wear out
our welcome. How about some
place new, such as Rhodesia?
Forget it! Those people there. are
uncivilized. Always ﬁghting and
killing each other- Not to worry.
We’ll think of something. Perhaps
we could rent a hall. After all, you
have to spend money to make

money.

PAS you may have guessed, I am
against registration, draft and, un-
patriotic as it may sound, even war.
I’m equally against all three because
none of these could exist without
the other two. That’s why it makes
sense to stop this nonsense at level
one: registration. If we all refuse to
register, the leaders of this country
would find a peaceful solution.
Quickly! I’m all for __patriotism
when it is well-founded but my
quest for peace overrides any
loyalties I may have to this country.
I say that we refuse to register. Pure

‘ and simple.

“Pacifist!” Close friends know
that I never back away from a fight
when I believe in what I’m fighting
for and I have no other choice. I'm
telling you here and now that we

but, rather, for my family, friends

tum that is carrying us to destruc-
tion right now. _

Don't tempt me. Actually, I love
this country but I'm not blinded by
that love. When America forces it’s

Canada look awful good. ,

_ “How do‘ you expect to have the
freedoms that this country offers
you without being willing to fight
for them?” This i's‘a~eircular ques-
tion. Our freedom to decide
whether or not to kill is taken from
us so that we may have freedom. If
this seems legitimate to you, then

this country really has a problem.

I’m going ‘through all of this to"

disprove the myth that refusal to

ﬁght is always a sign of some per-

sonal shortcoming. It may be based

on good sense. To those who have

fought in previous wars, by choice,
in order to make this an indepen-

ing. trampled by an aggressor, you
have our sincere gratitude. That is
not the case here and many of us

refuse to buy into our govemment’s "

and diplomacy. _

Finally, without getting into a
heavy discussion of theology or

The only thing that went Pitt’s
way Wednesday night was the in-
itail tip. After that, it was all Penn
State, as the Lady Lions clawed the
Pantherettes, 68-48. The Pan-
therettes are now 19-9 for the
season, with three games remain-

' ing.

During theiriﬁrst possession, the
Pantherettes shot a frustrating 29
per cent for the night, hitting only
20-of-68 from the floor. Mean-
while, the Lady Lions were hitting
at a 42 per cent clip, canning

30-of-71 ﬁeld goals.” Exactly half of
these field goals came in the first
half, as Penn State built a 32-20
halftime lead.

The first half saw Penn State
come out with a menacing full court
press, which hindered the Pan-
therette attack. Sue martin and
Corinne-Gulas led the Lady Lions
to a 12-4 lead before Pitt called time
out. ,

While the Pantherettes were plot-
ting plays to break the press and
crack the tough PSU defense, the
Lady Lions were changing their
game plan. Penn State switched to

a man-to-man defense and inserted
Janet Gabriel. Gabriel quickly_
swished four outside shots, giving
the Lady Lions a 20-10 edge.

Keeping the game from getting
out of hand was Pitt freshman Pen-
ny Welsh.Welsh pumped in six of
the Pantherettes ten points. Then
Debbie Lewis took over the scoring
chores with about two minutes re-
maining. Lewis tallied six points,
giving ‘Penn State only a 32-20
halftime lead.

The Pantherettes looked. as if
they might pull'off another come-
from-behind victory in the first five

minutes of the second half . Slowly,
but surely, the Pantherettes sliced
the lead. With fifteen minutes to
go, PSU held a slim 36-29 lead.

However, a minute-and-a—half
later, the Lady Lions exploded with
eight unanswered points, and it was
all over for the Pantherettes._
Although Pitt had five less tur-
novers than Penn State, it was times
like these when PSU capitalized on
them that hurt Pitt.

The Pantherettes will now have

Midwest, many of which sport

some very impressive credentials.
The tournament will be run on a

  Iger Paul Relies  
' On Sheer zaniness

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

As most cheerleaders go, Tiger
Paul would be an unlikely can-
didate for much popularity and suc-
cess. While most spirit-raisers have__
the physical appearance of potential
beauty queens, Tiger relies on sheer
zaniness and enthusiasm to win sup-
port from audiences at Pitt basket-
ball games. And while it may be’
painful to the regular P_itt cheer-
fgading squad, the fact remains that
no one, but no one can get a group
of Pitt students to respond the way

Tiger Paul can.

“.

A good many people arounduthe

Pitt campus might be" curious to
know a bit more about this middle-

aged man who wore a tuxedo to the ‘

Pitt-Duke game last month. (Which
was" nothing, compared to the out-
fits Tiger donned during the Billy
Knight-Mickey/ Martin-Keith Starr-
Buzz Ridl days at Pitt.) Among out-
fits, Tiger came disguised as Santa
Claus, in Bermuda shorts, andin
perhaps the greatest scene ever, a
pair of loose fitting pajamas, for
Pitt’s win over Rutgers in 1975.)
Paul. Auslander, a resident of
East Liberty, is 37-years old, and a
1960 graduate of Peabody High
School. He attended Duquesne
University briefly, but decided the
college life wasn’t for him. An
authentic sports nut, Tiger used to
coach high school all-star teams in
post season tournaments during the
1960’s and early ’70s. It was there
thathe was “discovered,” by Tim

Grgurich, then a Pitt assistant, and.

several Pitt alumni. The Tiger Paul
Show came ‘to the Field House in
1972, and has had a brilliant, and
_sometimes rocky stay, ever since.

“I didn’t think it would work,”

said Tiger. “I figured, ‘Well, these

‘By MARK NITOWSKI

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Panthers traveled to a peren-~

nial hell-hole for all Pitt
teams Wednesday night, and came
away on the short end of a 28-11
score. . .

The first period seemed to be the
big 8 problem for the Panthers
throughout the W.V.U. match,‘ as
Pitt grapplers repeatedly fell behind

in the opening period and found ,

emselves vainly scrapping to get

otter $_|ipper_y’Ro¢|E.$un’day‘ ' ‘

people are never going to respond
to me.” .

But they did, and what would
Tiger say is the reason for such
great fan appeal? -

“That’s -what I’d like to know,”
he says, sounding a bit puzzled.
“But I do know a person’s only as
good as the people who respond to
him,” crediting Pitt’s"students. “As
long as I get this kind of response,
I’ll keep doing it. I’m really into
the program.”

The highlight of Tiger’s early
days was the 1973-74 season, when
Pitt reeled off «22 consecutive vic-
tories en route to a 25-4 season, and
a spot in the NCAA Eastern
Regional Finals, where they lost to
eventual champion North Carolina
State. _ Tiger’s mystical powers
helped the Panthers to victories
over Duke, Syracuse and Temple,
before packed houses at the Field
House.

The following year, Pitt went

18-11, but with Tiger leading the ,

cheers, Pitt knocked off such
powers as Marquette, Rutgers,
Virginia and Notre Dame. In Tiger
Paul’s first two full seasons on the
sidelines, the Panthers chalked up a
perfect 27-0 record at home.

When Ridl resigned, Grgurich
came in, and Pitt’s program seemed
to have contracted some type of bug
about the same time, "a bug

Grgurich is still trying to shake‘

loose from his program. Injuries
and ineligibilities ripped the roster,
and the Panthers were to go 18-36
thenext two seasons. And during
that span, Tiger wasn’t around as

much, due to a ‘tiff with Pitt’s‘

athletic administration, who seem-

ed to be of the opinion that too

much noise and enthusiasm might

To Pitt head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer that inability to jump out in

1 front early was the key contributing
7 factor to the Panther’s Morgan-

town loss.

“I think the problem against
W.V.U. was that when we came out
.for the match we weren’t ready,”
explained Stottlemyer. “Conse-
quently, we fell behind in the first

period. But the guys came back .

period, and that’s a real credit to
them. However, most of the time it
was just a matter of too little, too
late.”

Unlike recent matches against
powerful Michigan, Michigan State
and Cleveland State though, the
Panthers stayed with the Moun-

’ taineers the whole way.

Pitt’s two gymnastics teams will

Sunday at 2 p.m. in Trees Hall.

Pitt 'men’s coach Frank D’Amico
said he is not expecting as much
from the Slippery Rock men. In
fact, he hopes to be able to use
some of - the Panthers who ‘haven’t
been exposed to a ‘lot of competi-
tion this year. He said he will try to
use freshmen Mike Lloyd and Brian

5 Balk. Lloyd works the sidehorse

while Balk’s specialty is the floor
exercise.

“We haven’t reached the score of
240 which I had thought‘ we could,”
said D’Amico. “I think we can do it
this weekend if we just hit our
routines.” P

~ In recent’ competition, the Pan-
thers -have done well. Last
weekend, they’ won everything in
Virginia against James Madison
and William and Mary.

The ring team had its best day all

‘year, according to D’Amico, with

four Panthersscoring well. Bob

' not "be good behavior for college

students. Tiger was banned from

g _the house. Why? '

“There was some_ misunderstand-

ing on my part, and maybe Icame
on too strong,” Tiger explains. “ I
‘thought that maybe if I got enough

publicity, I’d be able to break into
commercials or something.”

Tiger made his official return to
the scene two years ago for the Pitt-
Penn State game, a contest Pitt lost
in overtime. Unable to stand the
maddening silence of the crowd,
Tiger jumped out of his seat and

raced to the floor, receiving ‘a stan-

dingovation from the crowd.
“I’ve learned to get along with
people better,” says _Tiger, in
answer to why he has made
somewhat of a return to the good

graces of somelindividuals in Pitt’s

athletic department. “You might

win morefriends by not getting into
an argument, because you’re not
going to win them by arguing.
That’s one of the reasons I’m able
to get along with the administra-
tion, at least on my end.”

cheerleaders. ’

“I want them to get along with_

me. I want them to come over and
help me, but it’s up to them,” said
Tiger. “I know they work awfully
hard, they really do, and they do a

good job. I’d like to work with
them, because we’re all in it for the
same thing.” .

But, for now, Tiger is_ happy to
be back at the Field House, back to
leading the Pitt students cheering
section. By his own admission.

First Period -Problem for Grapplers

With Pitt trailing bya 1'6-7 count,
the Mountaineers put the match
away with four "decisions in the 158

1 Own Fan Appeal

Tiger has toned down his act, but
still gets ‘great pleasure out of whiff
he does.

“This year has been very en-
joyable,” Tiger says very em-
phatically. “The Pitt students have
picked me up this year. I’ve paced
'myself, I don’t dance as much as I
used to, but I really enjoy it.”

Part of the reason for this year's
success, - according to Tiger, is
Grgurich} _

“I think if it weren’t for Tim
Grgurich, I probably wouldn’t be
cheering,” said Tiger. “I give him
a lot of credit. He's just gotten the
most out of the talent he has. KC)’s
a great guy. and he's an outstan-
ding coach.” ’ '

Before the season, Grgurich met
with Tiger, and informed him how
much he and the players wanted
him to be at the games. And Tiger
is very aperecietixe 9f. that,

they got behind early.”
