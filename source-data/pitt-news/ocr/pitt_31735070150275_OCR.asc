Pitt C7‘tt5/765 Rutgers
on Senior Day

Jonathan Coltogirone
For The Pitt News‘

Pitt entered Senior Day with quite
a task at hand: No. 18 Rutgers and
its stiﬂing defense came to Heinz
Field looking to clinch the Big East
title with a win, provided Louis-
ville lost.

Louisville obliged with a triple-
overtime defeat to Connecticut,
but the Pitt defense refused to al—
low Rutgers to celebrate a confer-
ence championship on its home
ﬁeld by dominating the game, as
the Panthers trounced the Scarlet
Knights atHeinz Field on Saturday
afternoon, 27-6.

Head coach Paul Chryst was
happy with the play of his defense,
which managed to allow only 50
yards on the ground.

“I thought we did a good job
stopping the run. Going in, we
thought that was going to be big,”
Chryst said after the game.

After the two teams traded
punts in the ﬁrst eight drives of
the game, Pitt ﬁnally broke the
stalemate with a 16-yard touch-
down pass from senior to senior,
as quarterback Tino Sunseri con-
nected with wide receiver Mike
Shanahan.

Pitt looked ready to score again
on its next drive, but a fumbled
snap by Sunseri on Rutgers’ 2-yard
line would eventually be recovered
by the Scarlet Knights. The mistake

It started with a snowﬂake and be-
came one of the world’s greatest
mathematical mysteries.

Four centuries later and that mys— ‘

tery was solved by a professor now
residing at Pitt.

Andrew W. Mellon Professor of
Mathematics Thomas C. Hales has
been selected by the American Math-
ematical Society to be an inaugural
fellow in 2013. AMS is the world’s
largest society dedicated to “further
the interests of mathematical re-
search and scholarship,” according
to its mission statement.

Hales earned this distinction for
his work on the Kepler Conjecture, a
statement about sphere packingthat,
though regarded as accurate, had
never been mathematically proven
——~ until now.

Hales and graduate student Sam-
uel Ferguson announced the break-
through back in 1998 while working
at the University of Michigan. But it
was only in 2006, after a panel of 12 .
referees became exhausted in their
attempt to check Hales’ work, that a
journal allowed its publication in the
Annals of Mathematics. The entire
process was highly unusual.

“When you see a problem that’s
gone unsolved for 400 years, you get
lured in by how easy it seems,” Hales
said. “By the time I realized the dif-
ﬁculty of it, I was hooked.”

Hales recounted the extensive
process that led to the conjecture’s
proof. The story began long before,
the conjecture’s namesake,Joharmes
Kepler, entered the picture, with a

Commission formulates postsecondary education recommendations

Michael Ringling .
News Editor

After months of planning, the Governor’s
Advisory Commission on Postsecondary
Education released a report on and recom-
mendations for the future of the common—
wealth’s postsecondary educational system.
Thecommission, composed of 31 mem-
bers from various components of the com-
monwealth’s postsecondary educational
system, including Pitt Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg and Penn State President Rodney
Erickson, published its report on Nov. 14.
According to the introduction in the re-
port, “Over the past year, the commission
has met and deliberated over critical issues
and challenges affecting the delivery of post-
secondary education and considered ways to
maintain the quality of education, assure its
longevity and adapt to the changing work-
force needs and evolving demographics of



conversation in the late 1590s between two
men: Sir Walter Raleigh and Thomas Harriot.

Raleigh, an English aristocrat, adventurer,
author and poet, was about to embark on a
sea voyage and needed some organizational
assistance. He turned to Harriot, a renowned
astronomer and mathematician, and asked the
best way to stack carmonballs on a ship.

Harriot, one of the initial believers of the
atomic theory, began corresponding with his
friend, Kepler.

Kepler, a German scholar, had already made
a name for himselfin the ﬁelds of mathematics
and astronomy, postulating laws of planetary
motion.

Kepler was unconvinced by the similarities
between the cannonball concept and the new-
fangled atomic theory that was milling about
until he was walking down an alley and saw a
six—sided snowflake.

Then, everything changed.

Kepler began to think of the snowﬂake’s
structure and the internal arrangements that
led to its hexagonic nature. Kepler proposed the
cannonball arrangement in 1611 as the densest

method of sphere packing — the same method
grocers frequently utilize when stacking or-
anges or other spherical edibles.

However, Kepler couldn’t prove his own idea.

“The Kepler conjecture is famous partly
because it took so long to prove and because
many great mathematicians attacked the prob-
lem over the centuries without success or with
partial success. [Sir Isaac] Newton and [Carl
Friedrich] Gauss both worked on it and brought

the users.”

After 16 public meetings across the state,
the commission formulated four key goals
for the state’s system of higher education:
affirm opportunities for lifelong learning;
ensure greater public access, affordability
and usability of postsecondary education;
recognize and support the diversity and
richness of the postsecondary education

system, and enhance Pennsylvania’s eco-
nomic vitality and the ability for the com-
monwealth to compete globally.

“The commonwealth recognizes that the
postsecondary system is a key component
to the well-being of the state, not only as
an economic engine but also to provide for
an educated citizenry,” thereport states.
“Institutions and their leaders have pro-
vided true stewardship for the asset of the
commonwealth postsecondary system and
now offer recommendations to plan for its
future.”

Johannes Kepler

some insight into the problem but couldn’t solve
it,” said Ivan Yotov, the chair of Pitt’s mathemat-
ics department.

In 1900, the famous mathematician David
Hilbert named the conjecture on his list of 23
problems in mathematics. Hilbert’s list of un-
solved conjectures directed the ﬁeld for much
of the 20th century.

The problem seems simple enough but was i

nearly impossible to prove. There were innu-
merable possibilities in arrangingthe spheres,
and to solve the conjecture, Hales would have
to go through each one.

“The increase in the power of computers
led to the ability to solve it. Computers had to
run for three months to generate the solution,”
Hale said.

Yotov expounded on the importance of com-

The commission settled on these four
key goals after members of the commission
broke into four working groups — work-
force needs, accessibility and affordability,
administration and ﬁnancial structures and
collaboration — and formulated more than
100 ideas. These ideas were then synthe-
sized down to around thirty, and from those,
the group prioritized them to formulate the
four key goals.

In the report, these goals are broken
down into subpoints with more speciﬁc
plans for the goals’ implementation into
the commonwealth system.

To afﬁrm opportunities for lifelong
learning, the commission proposes creat-
ing a ”passport for learning,” which would
“transform postsecondary education into
a learner-based, consumer—driven system
through a dynamic online platform.” The
commission also proposes enhanced college
and career counseling, expanding personal

puters in proving the conjecture. ‘

“Professor Hales’ proof is based on reduc-
ing the inﬁnitely many possibilities to about
5,000 that potentially could be better. He then
eliminates them one by one by usingasophisti-
cated computer.program,” Yotov said. “This is
afascinating example of combining traditional
pen—and—paper mathematical arguments with
computations.”

Even when the 300-page proofwas submit-
ted in 1998, the process was far from ﬁnished.
Each year the dozen referees would return to
Hales, informing him that they were 99 per-

, cent certain it was correct but needed more

time. Finally, in 2006, they pled exhaustion
and formally armounced they were 99 percent
certain of the proof’s correctness. The journal
accepted Hales’ work and published the proof.

ﬁnance literacy education in grades K-12 and
supporting remediation programs.

The commissions also issued more spe-
ciﬁc recommendations to meet its second
goal, ensuring greater accessibility, afford-
ability and usability of postsecondary edu- ‘
cation. .

The report states that the “common-
wealth should aspire to serve as a national
role model for developing innovative solu-

tions to the pressing challenge of controlling 1

education costs while maintaining quality
consistent with institutional missions.”

To do this, the commissions proposes
cost—management initiatives such as en-
couraging institutions to periodically pub-
lish their per-student costs, encouraging
institutions to conduct comprehensive ef-
ﬁciency reviews and supporting the efforts
of institutions to work together.

Commission D 3

But Hales was unsatisﬁed.

“This was ridiculous. Math should be cut
and dry. You shouldn’t have to wait years and
years. I thought, there’s gotta be a better way,”
-Hales said. .

And so began the Flyspeck Project, aproject
aimed to act asan artiﬁcial referee by completely
checkingthe accuracy of a proof. Under the proj-
ect, aformal proof is created, which differs from
a traditional one in that every intermediate step
is provided with no jumps left up to intuition.
Because it is less intuitive, the formal proof is
less susceptible to logical errors.

Hales is close to the project’s completion
now, which would allow for 100-percent cer-
tainty in regard to his proof.

Although the program would “still require
acertain amount of human interaction,” Hales
said, it has far-reaching applications.

Flyspeck could be used to check the accu-
racy of computer encoding on chips, thereby
preventing costly recalls such as that of Intel’s
mishap in 1994, which cost over $400 million.
The bug had signiﬁcant repercussions because
of the incorrect divisions it caused.

The program could also be used for the
monitoring of aircraft software or automo-
bile braking systems. Sphere packing itself is
important for engineers, as well as for error-
correcting codes.

Hales’ recently published book, “Dense
Sphere Packings: A Blueprint for Formal
Proofs,” demonstrates the new “proving of
the proof” along with additional conjecture
solutions in discrete geometry.

“The resolution of the Kepler Conjecture
is one of the most important developments in
discrete and computational geometry in the
last century,” Yotov said. I

COMMISSION

To achieve the commission’s third goal
— recognizing and supporting the diversity
and richness of the postsecondary education
system — the commission proposes linking
funding to performance.

“Institutions will be rewarded for either
sustaining performance on a metric if results
are within the target range or improving
performance if results are below the target
range,” the report states.

Additionally, the report includes a four-
year plan that outlines the implementation
of base funding levels for institutions across
that time span.

The commission states that to achieve
its fourth goal — enhancing Pennsylvania’s
economic vitality and the ability for the
commonwealth to compete globally — “it
is essential that the commonwealth, busi-
ness sectors and education communities
collaborate to develop regional and state-
wide partnerships that strengthen the work-
force through quality and relevant educa-
tion programs, attract industry through a
business—friendly environment and support
innovation through advanced research, spe-
ciﬁcally in the areas of science, technology,

engineering and medicine.”
' The plan proposes that the governor ad-

vance the research enterprises in the com— .

monwealth through “tax incentives and
other programs.”

Pitt’s Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
released a statement regarding the_com-
mission’s report. In it, he stated that “the
University of Pittsburgh has demonstrated
a/record of commitment to, and success in,
cost containment  An even more intense
focus on cost containment and participation
in a performance—based funding system,
then, can be viewed as just natural exten-
sions of what we already do and what we
recognize to be responsible approaches to
management.” ‘

“The actions recommended in this report
are both thoughtful and balanced. Funding

0 recommendations were crafted with a clear

awareness that state resources likely will
continue to be constrained, at least in the
near term,” Nordenberg said in the press re-
lease. “However, the commission also recog-
nized that our future strength requires that
we build upon, and not harm, what is one

A of Pennsylvania’s most important assets.”

PINIONS

THE STAMATTACK

Libraries could be great again, if
only we removed the books

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opz'nz'ons Editor

As a way to connect two pieces
of paper, there are few better tools
than a stapler.

Without the aid of electronics, a
piece of zinc-plated steel is punctured
into two sheets of paper and then
bent-, combining the two into one. V

This is the design function of a
stapler. It performs best when used
for this purpose.

For other uses of a stapler, success
is not a guarantee.

If used as a hammer, for instance,
a stapler will only work in limited
circumstances. In the best case, an
older, heavier, metal model might
workto getanailthrough softwood,
but even then, the hand positioning
and effort required would make the

Y task awkward.

The modern library is a stapler,
and we are all using it as a hammer.

When libraries were invented

thousands of years ago, they were
an excellent design solution to a huge
problem: a lack of accessibility to
mankind’s collective knowledge. Like
a stapler, they were designed to solve
this problem, and have evolved with
the purpose of solving this problem
most eﬂiciently.

Closed stacks only accessible to
librarians gave way to open stacks
anybody could ‘investigate. Clas-
siﬁcation systems, card catalogs,
interlibrary loans and, eventually,
electronic databases reduced time

- needed to ﬁnd information from days
- to hours.

Yet today, few use the library to
ﬁnd information. Theaverage un-
dergraduate doesn’t need to pore
over volumes or periodicals. Many
undergraduates ﬁnd physical librar-
ies conﬁising and unhelpﬁil, ulti-
mately preferring online resources.
Researchers widely prefer electronic
journals to printed ones.

The design speciﬁcation of librar-

ies has changed. There is no longer
a problem of a lack of accessibility
to mankind’s collective knowledge.
For very few people is a library the
only connection to the world around
them. -

Today, the physical’library is used
primarily for studying and under-
standing information. As made ap-
parent from even casually observing

the hundreds of students huddled at 1

tables and cubicles, surrounded by
stacks ofbooks, this studying aspect
is the real value—added aspect of the
library today.

So when we spend hours studying
in Hillman Library, a space designed
primarily for the purpose of accessing
information, all we are really doing is
hammering our nails with staplers.

Hillman wasn’t designed to opti-

Karaoke is the cure to all of your
emotional and relationship problems

Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist _

This word can breed either
overwhelming excitement or
heart-wrenching fear, inspire
outlandish personalities or send
introverts back into their shells.
This word represents the brave
and forces the weak to return
where they belong. The word?
Karaoke.

Karaoke is both the favorite
pastime of some college students
and the bane of others’ existenc-
es. For those of you who love it,
pay no heed to my opinion, you
already agree with me. But if you
find karaoke to be threatening,
embarrassing or just plain stu-
pid: listen up. You need to sing
-— loud and proud.

Frankly, karaoke improves
every aspect of your life, from
your personal relationships to
your academic performance to

your self-confidence. So get up,
give it a shot and watch it work
wonders.

First of all, karaoke has the
power to begin relationships. If
you spot a fine lady or gentleman
in the crowd whom you can’t
seem to get to, all you have to
do is sing a love ballad such as
Frankie Valli’s “Can’t Take My
Eyes Off You” and already you
have an ice breaker. Or if you
spot someone in a big group of

friends, sing a group favorite — '

like any Backstreet Boys song
— so that the group will get up
and sing too. Then you can all
be friends, and you can start a
personal conversation with your
person of interest — after the
song is over, of course.

If it isn’t romance you’re
looking for, karaoke is a uni-
ﬁer that can allow you to make
a dozen new friends in a single
night. Again, the more popular

hits, such as “Total Eclipse of
the Heart” and “Wagon Wheel,”
will get the crowd singing along
with you, which will simultane-
ously calm your nerves and win
you some new friends who think
you’re awesome. Maybe you’ll
evenmeet someone who hates
karaoke as much as you do, and
once you sing that one song that
introduces you, you’ll never have
to sing again.

Karaoke can also mend re-
lationships that might be hit-
ting some rough patches. Noth-
ingsays “I’m sorry” to a» friend
you’ve wronged like a creative
rendition of “I Want You Back.”
If you’re mad and can’t seem to
express it using the right words,
try the All-American Rejects’
“Gives You Hell.” Or if a friend
is going through a tough time,
you can show a little support

third and fourth floors along the walls are not
numerous enough to satisfy demand. Even the
size of the tables is a bit too big to make group
work really productive.

There is evidence university libraries
across the country aren’t meeting student’s
needs. Only 32 percent of undergraduates
rated campus spaces effective for study, ac-
cording to Gensler, a global architecture ﬁrm.
Furthermore, Gensler ﬁnds the percentage of
students who want a quiet study place exceeds
the percentage of students who actually ﬁnd a
quiet study place, suggestingcampus buildings,
including libraries, are notbeing designed with
the user requirements in mind.

Imagining the library of the ﬁxture thus be-
comes a question of imagining how to create
a space most likely to lead to studying. The
ﬁrst, and most radical change, concerns the
presence of books.

with a chorus or two of “Lean on Me” to
let him or her know that the difficulties
won’t change anything in your friendship.
Karaoke is fun, but it can get real too.

Now, say that you already have enough
friends, a significant other and every-
thing is just peachy keen in your relation-
ships. Great for you, but that doesn’t get
you out of karaoke. There are personal
beneﬁts that make it worth facing your
fears.

One of the best parts of karaoke is its
ability to serve as a respite from stress.
College is hard. And stressful. And we’re
busy all the time. As students, we need
fun, healthy ways to release that tension.
When singing along to one of your favorite
songs, the music will bring you to another
place —— away from your exams, home-
work and classes. When singing karaoke,
you get wrapped up in the moment and
forget about your failing grade or unfin-
ished grad—school applications. As you
sing, the stress will melt right off your
shoulders. _ ,

Once it’s gone, you’ll feel like the fea-

They should be eliminated. Or sharply re-
duced. And in the place of drastically fewer
books should be areas designed forthe sole pur-
pose offacilitatingboth quiet and loud studying.

Pitthas already begun this transformation,
having in recentyears moved about 20 percent
of its library collection to its off-site facility in
Point Breeze, according to the Post—Gazette.
Many other schools are following a similar path.

These models don’t destroy books, or end
their presence within research institutes. In-
stead, off—site locations, which offer denser
packing, optimal climate control and often
automated selection systems, can enhance the
research experience, if done properly and with
enough investment. '

But this is beside the point. Libraries, the
physical buildings, are for the vast majority
not about research. So even if there is a loss
of convenience from off—site books, a more
optimal study environment is a good tradeoff.

In place of books could be dozens of group
areas with Whiteboards and furniture better
suited for group work. Rows of private study

sibility of your workload has improved.
When your assignments seem easier to
complete, you’ll complete them better
and perform better in your courses. It’s
a simple flow of events that starts with
relieving‘ your stress through karaoke and
ends with you becoming a better student.

But most importantly, karaoke is a nat-
ural conﬁdence booster. The best thing
about it is that you don’t have to be good.
If you’re a mediocre singer at best, a suc-
cessful karaoke adventure depends solely
on your song choice and not your skill
level. Get a crowd of people singing along
with classics such as “Sweet Carol-ine” or
“Don’t Stop Believin’,” then not only will
they drown out your singing, but you’ll
also feel like a stronger singer. Ifyou can
lead a room in song, what can’t you do?
Your nerves will relax, and you’ll walk out
more confident than ever before.

If you’re feeling nervous about the
dreaded pastime that your friends al-
ways suggest, don’t fret! Take a chance,
pick a crowd—pleaser and sing your heart
out. Strangers, your friends, your future
friends and you will all benefit from the
experience. Rock on! I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

This is in regard to a recent news story
about the changing ideology within the
University Honors College.

“I interpret [the phrase ‘academic at-
tainment’] to mean students (and faculty)
who strive to actually accomplish some-
thing, as opposed to idle thought, however
deep and clever it may be,” Stricker said in
an email. r »

I was one of the many students who
had the privilege to study under the tute-
lage of Doc and his UHC. He always used to
proudly boast that he would never support
the research of “calculating the bejazzer
parameter to the 100th decimal place.”
That is to say, he would never support
research that was merely “accomplish-
ing something.” The UHC was a place for
the kind of research that you couldn’t.do
elsewhere: Research that only promised
rigorous hard work and an intellectually
stimulating community — not necessar-
ily “results.” After all, new ideas are always
idle at ﬁrst.

Doc recognized that the trick isn’t to

teach students to walk into a well-known
space — already ﬁt with goals and metrics
— and crank until they get results. That’s
machine training. The trick is to teach stu-
dents how to carve out their own spaces, to
deﬁne the results they are looking for and
recognize how the shapes of their prob-
lems map onto and touch those of their
peers. See, computers are ever-more efﬁ-_
cient at ﬁlling up our problem spaces. But"
we are still the unique architects of these
realms.‘This was the missionof the UHC:
to train students — ravenous for idle,
deep thought — to become architects of
Worlds unknown. It’s no coincidence that
Doc’s own research started by taking the
science—ﬁction book, “Flatland,” about a
planar universe and asking “What happens
to physics in a two-dimensional world?”

I can only hope that the UHC corrects
course before a tremendous and unique in-
stitution is dismantled. » ..v.-,

Panthers ﬁnish third in NIT Season Tip—Off

Jasper Wilson
Assiszfarzt Sports Editor

NEW YORK —- The Pitt men’s basketball
team spent its Thanksgiving break in
New York City, competing in the NIT
Season Tip-Off ﬁnals.

While the Panthers didn’t return
home undefeated, they did come back
to Pittsburgh with the knowledge that
they competed well against one of the
best teams in the country and that they
can recover strongly from the adversity

,.__§of defeat.

‘\

No. 4 Michigan 67, Pitt 62

In a sparsely populated Madison
Square Garden on Wednesday night, the
Oakland Zoo, conﬁned to a small corner
section, made itself right at home, yell-
ingand establishing a presence among
a crowd largely dominated by opposing
fans.

And for the majority of the game, the
Pitt men’s basketball team made its pres-
ence known on the court.

Since the 2000-2001 season, the Pan-

. gthers have gone 28-14 at the fabled New

York City arena, and it looked as though
they might make it 29 victories con-
sidering how they aggressively played
early on in the semiﬁnal game against
Michigan.

But over the course of the game
against the Wolverines (5-0) and star
guard Trey Burke, the Panthers with-
ered, eventually losing 67-62.

In a matchup that Michigan head
coach John Beilein metaphorically
described as “big-man basketball,” the

‘ -absence of literal big men became clear

for Pitt when it mattered most.

The Panthers were out-rebounded
by 11, and this inability to extend plays
limited their number of second-chance
opportunities in a game of extremely

_ _thin margins —- neither team ever led by

(‘double ﬁgures.

Eight players scored for Pitt in the
ﬁrst half, and the team edged to the
front to take a 33-29 lead at intermis-
sion.

The low—scoring nature of the contest
3didn’t surprise Beilein.

“We sort of anticipated that hard-
fought defensive struggle,” he said.

As such, Michigan needed to focus on
a couple of areas. .

“It was important for us to get as

_ «physical down low and on the boards

with them as possible,” Beilein said.
Pitt’s early success forced Michigan
to adjust defensively.
“We were really having trouble with
the pick-and—roll action,” Beilein said.

Dante Taylor and the Panthers are now 5-1 this season. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

“The biggest thing was it puts them in
position to offensive rebound. In the
ﬁrst half, if they did miss, they had a
putback, so we thought we’d maybe take
them out of some rhythm.”

A 1-3-1 zone was implemented to
clog up the area near the basket and
impede Pitt’s ability to gather offensive
rebounds.

It worked. Pitt managed only two
offensive rebounds in the second half
and six total. The neutralization of any
sort of inside presence was something
Michigan aimed to accomplish.

“[Coming into tonight], Pitt was win-
ning games off of offensive rebounding,”
Beilein said. “They always have been
very good at that.”

In the beginning, Burke did it all for
the Wolverines (5-0), using his blister-
ing speed to create for himself off the
dribble. The sophomore scored nine
points in the ﬁrst half, and his promi-
nence forced attention away from his
teammates later in the game —— a crucial
development.

Pitt managed to keep the Wolverines
at bay until midway through the sec-
ond period when they tied the game at
44 with 9:27 left — the ﬁrst time they
hadn’t trailed in nearly 15 minutes, and
they wouldn’t trail again.

Sensing an opening, the pro-Mich-
igan crowd woke from its slumber and
got behind the rallying team.

Throughout the rest of the game,

Pitt tried to catch up but unfortunately
failed.

Lamar Patterson, who led the Pan-
thers with 14 points, said they need to
improve their fortitude.

“We’ve got to get tougher,” the junior
forward said.

Freshman point guard James Robin-
son agreed.

“I deﬁnitely think we need to play a
lot harder,” Robinson said.

Trey Burke ﬁnished with 17 points.

He had help in the second half
though, with three of his teammates
ﬁnishing in double digits. One of those
teammates was Tim Hardaway_]r., who
scored 11 of his 16 points in the second
half, beginning when he tied the game
and continuing as he helped to maintain
the team’s subsequent lead.

Hardaway credited Burke for ﬁnding
him and his other teammates when Pitt
began to focus on him.

“They were collapsing here and there,
and Trey did a good job of just kicking it
out,” Hardaway said.

After Pitt lost its advantage, the team
had to change mindsets. l

“Once they went up, we knew we had
to get in attack mode,” Robinson said.

Down ﬁve with less than 30 seconds
left, Robinson embodied this aggres-
sive mindset. Scoring three consecutive
times and cutting the lead whenever he

Pitt footba|l’s
1 up-and-down
  Big East (life

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt football team’s existence in the
Big East ended like it began.

On Sept. 14, 1991, Pitt fans watched
the Panthers’ first home game in the Big
East football conference’s inaugural sea-
son. That day, Pitt defeated lowly Temple
26-7 in front of 31,084 witnesses at Pitt
Stadium.

Today -— 21 years later — 38,786 Pitt
fans saw an equally dominant perfor-
mance from the Panthers (5-6, 2-4 Big
East) as they crushed No. 18 Rutgers (9-
2, 5-1 Big East) at Heinz Field, 27-6.

While Pitt still has one conference
game remaining — a matchup at South
Florida next week that the Panthers need
to win to become bowl-eligible -~ today’s
win marked the last time Big East foot-
ball will grace the Heinz Field grass be-
fore Pitt officially joins the Atlantic Coast
Conference next season.

From the entertaining to the disap-
pointing, Pitt fans have seen it all dur-
ing the University’s years in the Big East.
Here are some Big East moments that I
consider the best and the worst for the
Pitt football team from the past two de-
cades:

Best game: No. 21 Pitt 31, No. 5 Vir-
ginia Tech 28 (Nov. 8, 2003)

With ESPN’s College GameDay in
town, the nation’s eyes were on the cru-
cial Big East matchup between the Pan-
thers and the Hokies. And the two ranked
teams didn’t disappoint.

After an entertaining, back-and-forth
contest, Pitt fullback Lousaka Polite
plunged into the end zone in the game’s
ﬁnal minute to hand the Panthers the
upset and their biggest victory in recent
memory. Virginia Tech, Miami and Bos-
ton’ College left the Big East for the ACC
the next year, and the conference has
never been the same.

Worst game: Temple 29, Pitt 27 (Oct.
14, 1995)

Losing to Temple in the Big East’s ear-
ly years was embarrassing for any team
in the conference. The Owls entered this
contest with a 27-game conference los-

didn’t cost the Panthers, however, who re-
sponded with a 1-yard touchdown dive by
senior running back Ray Graham just a few
minutes later.

Playing in his last game at Heinz Field

‘ for the Panthers, Graham ﬁnished with 113

yards and one touchdown on 23 carries,
passing Craig “Ironhead” Heyward for third
on Pitt’s all-time rushing list.

Graham says that he’s just happy to be
in the same conversation with some of the
Pitt greats.

“It’s a blessing,” said Graham of his
accomplishment. “I never take anything
for granted. We have come a long way as a
group, but all those individual stats don’t
mean anything without my team.”

Pitt followed its second scoring drive
with another defensive stand, forcing the
eighth straight punt from the Rutgers of-

" fense. And when Sunseri found wide re-

ceiver Ed Tinker for a 16-yard touchdown
pass just before halftime, Pitt stretched its
lead even further. .

The touchdown reception was the ﬁrst in
the career of Tinker, who was ﬁlling in after
Devin Street was injured early in the game.

“Devin was hurt and [Tinker] per-
formed,” Chryst said. “You always like to
see a guy come in and contribute for the
ﬁrst time.”

Also making his ﬁnal appearance at
home, Sunseri completed 21—of—39 pass
attempts for 227 yards and two touchdowns.

Shanahan said that the team wasn’t go-
ing to let up after jumping out to a big lead
at halftime and that the Panthers ﬁnally
played a complete game.

“Coming in 21-0, we knew Rutgers wasn’t
just going to lay down,” Shanahan said. “But
you know, I think everyone came out ready
to play and played a full 60 minutes, and
I don’t think we’ve done that all season.”

The ﬁrst drive of the second half resulted
in the ninth straight punt from Rutgers,
leading to a 39-yard ﬁeld goal by Pitt senior
kicker Kevin Harper. The -Scarlet Knights
would ﬁnally answei?-_*Pitt’s scoring prow-
ess with an 11-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Gary Nova to wide receiver
Brandon Coleman, although the subsequent
2-point conversion attempt failed. .

The slight shift in momentum as a re-
sult of the Rutgers score would ultimately
be negated by an interception early in the
fourth quarter by Pitt cornerback Lafayette

.Pitts, the ﬁrst of his career.

The teams would again trade posses-
sions after punts, preceding another Kevin
Harper ﬁeld goal, which ﬁnished the game’s
scoring.

Junior defensive tackle Aaron Donald
was Pitt’s clear standout on the defensive
side of the ball, recording seven tackles —
three of which were for a loss — and one
sack. When asked about Pitt’s tendency to
play to the level of its competition, Donald
didn’t seem to have any answers for the
trend. -

“We practice the same way each week,”
he said;'“We seem like we are ready each
week, but it doesn’t always come out the
same.” ' .

The Panthers’ hopes of bowl eligibility
rest with their ﬁnal scheduled game at South
Florida (3-8, 1-5 Big East) next Saturday,
Dec. 1, at a time to be determined.

Senior safety Andrew Taglianettifought
back tears as he explained what playing with
this senior class has meant to him and how
badly he and his teammates want to make
a bowl game.

“These guys are my best friends,” he
said. “I came in with them ﬁve years ago,
and it’s been a lot of fun, for sure. I’m going
to miss them.” I

ing streak before beating a Pitt team that
ﬁnished the season with nine straight
losses.

Luckily for the Panthers, only 4,968
fans showed up to Veterans Stadium in
Philadelphia to watch Pitt’s most miser-
able defeat of the Big'East era.

Best play: Darrelle Revis’ 73-yard
punt return against West Virginia
(Nov. 16, 2006)

Looking back on it, my mind is still
convinced Pitt won this game — this
play was that good.

Late in the first half with the score
tied at 17, Revis picked up a rolling punt
at his own 27-yard line and hesitated with
two defenders bearing down on him. He
then faked a lateral to absolutely no one,
received a crunching block by teammate

1 Derek Kinder on two Mountaineers and

sprinted across the Heinz Field turf to
the near sideline before cutting up the
ﬁeld toward the end zone, juking several
West Virginia players along the way. Af-
ter 23_ truly remarkable seconds, Revis
had given the Panthers the lead.

I don’t know if I’ve ever heard Heinz
Field that loud —— even for the Steelers.
The rest of the game seemed irrelevant,
but the box score tells me West Virginia
outscored Pitt 28-3 after Revis’ romp,
and the Mountaineers won the game 45-
27 — not important. ,

Worst play: Failed extra point
against Cincinnati (Dec. 5, 2009)

With the Big East title and a trip to the
Sugar Bowl on the line, No. 15 Pitt took
a 44-38 lead against No. 5 Cincinnati
after running back Dion Lewis scurried
for a touchdown with 1:36 remaining.
But holder Andrew Janocko fumbled the
snap on the extra point, and the Panthers
would regret that moment when Cincin-
nati quarterback Tony Pike completed a
29-yard scoring pass with 33 seconds left

to tie the game.

The Bearcats converted their extra
point to take the lead for the ﬁrst time
in the game, completing a devastating
comeback from a 21-point deficit and
stunning the fans at Heinz Field with
their 45-44 victory.

Best moment: Pitt 13, No. 2 West
Virginia 9 (Dec. 1, 2007)

Pitt hadn’t beaten a ranked West Vir-
ginia team on the road since 1954, and
the Panthers entered the 2007 regular
season finale as 28-point underdogs
against the seemingly National Champi-
onship Game—bound Mountaineers.

But in what will forever be remem-
bered as simply “13-9,” Pitt pulled off
one of the most shocking upsets in col-
lege football history during the 100th
Backyard Brawl, despite some shady ref-
erees, who might have wanted the Moun-
taineers to represent the Big East in the
title game.

Worst moment: Pitt loses last
scheduled Backyard Brawl (Nov. 25,
2011)

The only thing worse than seeing a
great rivalry end is seeing your team lose
in the final game of that rivalry.

Pitt fans experienced this disappoint-
ment last season when the Panthers blew
a 13-point lead to lose the last scheduled
Backyard Brawl against West Virginia,
21-20. The defeat was Pitt’s third straight
against its rival, giving the Mountaineers
bragging rights until the two teams meet
again;

With the Panthers’ impending move
to the ACC ﬁlling the schedule for eight
games a year, it could be awhile before
Pitt plays either of its two main rivals
again. ‘

But at least Pitt won its last game
against Penn State. I

BASKETBALL

drove to the basket, the freshman point
guard tried to lead a late Pitt comeback.

But Michigan would escape and
remain undefeated with a ﬁve—point
victory.

“We did just enough to win the game,”
Beilein said.

Pitt 85, Delaware 59

To start its game Friday afternoon at
Madison Square Garden, the Pitt men’s
basketball team scored 10 straight
points. .

And while the rest of the game
wasn’t a shutout, the entire opening half
seemed like one huge run for the Pan-
thers, who registered a comprehensive
victory over Delaware, 85-59.

Playing in the consolation game of
the NIT Season Tip—Off, Pitt led by as
much as 21 before the half and 27 before
the ﬁnal buzzer. The Blue Hens (2-3)
never led.

Five Pitt players ﬁnished with double
digits — the highest number of players
to do so this season.

In the ﬁrst half, the Panthers (5-1)
shot 65.4 percent from the ﬁeld, con-
necting on 17—of—26 attempts. They ﬁn-
ished with a 58.9 percent mark, making
33 of 56.

After its strong start, Pitt led 41-21 at
the break.

The lone bright spot for the Blue Hens
was Devon Saddler’s play throughout the
contest. The junior guard ﬁnished with
28 points and kept Pitt’s defense busy
with his aggressive offensive play.

Delaware’s press midway through the
second half caused some issues for the
Panthers, managing to close the deﬁ-
cit to 17 on multiple occasions, but the
Panthers’ lead never appeared to be in
real danger.

In addition to the ﬁve who managed
double ﬁgures, nine of 10 Pitt players
scored. The playing time was distributed
equally, with no Panther remaining on
the ﬂoor for more than 28 minutes and
each player receiving at least 10 minutes
on the court.

“I really do feel like we can play 10
guys out there and be really good,” Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “They
know they’re going to get minutes. They
know they’re going to play. I think it’s a
good feeling [for them]. You can see it by
the way we’re passing the ball.”

Delaware coach Monte Ross was frank
when looking back on the game.

“That was one of the more astounding
offensive performances that we’ve ever
had against us,” Ross said.

Speciﬁcally, the way in which Pitt
dominated from the game’s start left
Ross searching for answers.

“I don’t know [the reason for Pitt’s
early domination],” he said. “Well, I did
ask [my team] the question at halftime
‘Are you Pitt fans?’ We played like we
were watching the game and not partici-
pating in the game.’’

“I

Jamie Dixon

really do feel like we can play
10 guys out there and be really
good. You can see it by the way
we’re passing the ball.”

‘-Ia;
Kr

Once Pitt gained the lead, the dif-
ﬁculty of responding increased for the
Blue Hens, according to senior forward
Jamelle Hagins.

“We started off slow,” Hagins said,
“[and coming back] just got harder as
the game progressed.”

After such a close, potentially deﬂat-
ing loss against Michigan two nights be-
fore, Pitt’s strong performance pleased
Dixon.

“We responded well,” he said. “How
you respond says a lot about what this A»
team thinks about themselves and what
they can be.”

The Panthers return home and will
face Howard at 7 p.m. Tuesday night at
