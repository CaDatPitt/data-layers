Biddle, Rodd To iscuss
B Housing Issue Thursday

Housing, sore-point of discussion at the University for over a
year, switches from printed to Werbal explanations on Thursday
when Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men, and William F.‘ Rodd,
Jr., veteran student, discuss opposing views.

gThursday’sl housing discussion
_will take place in Stephen Foster
memorial at 3:30 p.m., as a pro]-

¥ ectof the Veterans association.

,The housing dlSCl1SSlO" is a di-
rect outgrowth of the proposed

‘ KQV “On the Spot” program can-

celled for “lack of over—all’ inter-
est” by station ofﬁcials.’
‘The original program had Mr.

H Biddle on -the spot before ‘three

students representing the Pitt stu-
dent body: Rodd; Tillie’ Sanker,
editor "of the News; Stuart Work-
master, president of the Vets as-
sociation and Patton‘ Riley, an-

' other Veteran student.

“The stand that the University
has taken after long investigation
and discussion, will be reiterated
Dean Biddle. The housing
problem "at Pitt was shelved be-

' cause it was felt that this situation

was secondary to more pressing
needs in the education ﬁeld. ’
Rodd, president of the All-Col-

» lege chapter of American Veterans

committee, and member of the
Veterans association, will present
his views as the speaker for a
group 'of unorganized veterans
now enrolled in SCl'10ul. I

Mr. Rodd, speaks neither for the
Pitt Veterans association, nor the
AVC. The association has taken
no deﬁnite stand’ on the housing
problem, and cannot until it has
been requested and passed by a
majority of the members of the

, association.

Spartan Ball‘ H

Men’s fraternities will become
true Greeks Friday, March 28,
when they present their Spartan
Ball in the main, ballroom of the
William Pen hotel, from 9 p.m.
to 1 a.m.

Elliot Lawrence, the 21-year-
old bandlea-deriwho is one of the
current sensations in the music
yvorld, has been signed -to play
for the Greek affair. His orches-
tra, which features vocalists Ros-
alyn Patton and Jack Hunter, is

one of the ﬁrst to use bassoons,

oboes, “and French and English
horns, in "“ad’dition: to” the usual
band instruments,

Chief highlight of this year’s IF

ball, based on Grecian themes, is
the presentation of a‘ king and
queen, who will be selected by
drawing prior to the dance. Plans
call for the couple to be chosen
by the fraternity which wins the
drawing, and kept secret until the
Late of the ball. ‘
_ Since the original attendance
estimate of 1000 couples has been
changed to 600, tickets must be
limited. Each house will distrib-
ute its quota of tickets.

Herb Mansmann has been nam-
ed chairman of the aﬁair, with
ager. Jim Duchene is handling
Herb Franklin as business man-

_ors.

ly formal dance of the year, the

Did you ever have a hot potato
for breakfast? Unless you believe
in the hearty “down-on.-the-
farm” type of meal, you probably
haven’t —— but the Pitt Breakfast
club makes a regular habit of it.

Every Wednesday morning at
7:30 these early bird meet in"
the cafeteria to get their break-
fasts, and then take them to the

Red Tuck shop, where they settle-
‘ down to discuss some timely issue.

-To be a member, all you have to
do‘ is roll out of bed in time to
get to the mess hall by 7:30.

Tomorro~w’s discussion centers
around the current question of a
state veterans’ bonus. A1 Dahl-
gren, who favors the bonus, plans
to tell the story of what happened
at the recent meeting called in
Harrisburg to discuss the propo-
sition. Mr. Herbert Parnes of the
economics department, is speak-
ing against the plan. A general
discussion will follow their argu-
ments.

Demas Barnes, assistant profes-
sor of history, who is one of the
faculty advisors, along with Louis
Johnston, assistant professor of
political science, and Richard Mc-
Coy, assistant research professor
of chemistry, believes that the
club is a good thing at Pitt.

H Jim Jordon, co—chairman of the
YW-YM sponsored group, says,
“The club is the revival of in-
formal professor-student discus-
sion of current topics, and should

member, speaks for the rest of
the group when she calls it “a.
cozy way of getting together in-
formally to discuss current prob-
lems.” ~

Betsy ‘ Sachs, dance chairman,
has assured that the dar ce ﬂoor
will accomodate a large crowd
bent on meeting the ccaches,
greeting old friends, and mak-
ing new acquaintances among
both advanced students and new
freshmen.

The affair is the fourth in a ser-

Wednesday, March-1.2, has been set aside for men’s spring
elections. On that day 25 new members of Men’s Council and
ﬁve of Student Congress will be elected.

Nominees for these positions will be made public in Fri-
day ’s issue of the News. From then until the day before elec-
tions We will run pictures and short write-ups on all of the
candidates for the purpose of acquainting the large body of
menstudents with those who will represent them during the
school year 1947-48‘. ’

For many years the student body had a legitimate gripe
in their complaint that they didn’t know the people running
for office; didn’t know their affiliations or their “platform”
and therefore declined to vote rather than vote blindly. Why
this condition existed has never been clear in the minds of
the editors of the News. So, with the forthcoming election as

"a springboard, we aim to clear the way for future, above

board, 100 per cent student—voted elections.

In order that the election and the period preceeding it be
the kind that most of the student body is clammoring for, we
ask the co-operation of the candidates, the students, and the
administration. We ask of the candidates—-co-operation in ar-
ranging time to have your picture taken, and in giving us in-
formation about yourself; of the students——tl1at you read care-
fully the data we compile . on each candidate before you vote,
and secondly, that you vote; of the a.dministra.tion—added priv-
ileges for candidates wishing to post placards, preferably in the
Tuck shops and cafeteria where most students gather. 1

Tomorrow is the last day that petitions for Men’s Coun-
cil posts. will be accepted. To date the dean of men’s oﬂice
h.as received petitions in abundance from every school except
Engineering and Mines. It has been our observation that the
engineers have found much time to complain about the way
things are being run in the Cathedral. Is not this the time
to do something about it?

Panthers Hustle; Top
Westminister 44.-39

Pitt gained its most satisfying victory of the campaign by

thumping Westminster, 44-39 at Farrell Saturday ‘night.

In addition to repaying in

kind an earlier 54-45 loss to the

Titans, the Panthers ran their victory skein to three——the long-
est of the season. They are one game shy of the .500 mark,
having won eight and lost nine.

The tall Titans from New Wil-
mington found their height ad-

'vantage to little avail against the

persistent Panthers. Although they
did sport a 7-3 lead midway
through the ﬁrst period, and later
deadlocked at 16-16 in the second
quarter.
Pitt Deadly Up Under

Westminster’s heave and hope
style of play failed to pay off as
the cautious Carlsonmen were

content to pass and cut while '

waiting for the inevitable open-
ing in the Titan defense. Time
and again the ﬂitting Panthers
drove in for easy lay ups.

For the ﬁfth time Dodo Can-
terna topped the Panther scor-
ers. His fourteen points garnered
from four two-plyers and six
penalty tosses was high for the
evening. Chet Dembinski tallied
12 markers to lead the Titans.

This was the ﬁrst Titan loss to
a district team. Previously they
had dropped decisions to CCNY
and Harvard; Their season record
is eighteen wins and three losses.

IM Athletics

In Full Swing

There are important goings-on
up the hill these days. Carl Olsen
and George Weekes, directors of
intramural sports, have established
the ﬁrst full—scale intramural pro-
gram since pre-war days.

Present centers of attraction in
the Olsen-Weekes promotion are
the wrestling tourney and the
second half fraternity basketball
loop.

Competition in the wrestling
tourney has been stiif. The grap-
plers, omitting the grunt-and-
groan antics, have ‘been throwing
them hard and ﬂat.

Among the grapplers who have
reached the semi-ﬁnals are: Don
Graham, Frank Druda, Ed Tessa-
ro, Sam Kalser, Bill Phillips, Mel

iCohen, James Cane,’ Bill Weir,

Dick Abraham, Tonny Mazzacco,
Herb Douglas, and Herb Stewart.‘
Frat basketball featured the
PiKA’s 43-24 triumph over ‘the
Phi Delts. With the approach
of spring, other teams whose for-
tunes have been less spectacular,
are hoping to thaw out.
Meanwhile in the School of
Law circuit, the Nine Old Men,
-beards, crutches, and all, scamper-
ed over the Neuro A.C., 74-19.
Additional leagues and tourneys
are in store for interested stu-
dents. Entries are being taken for
the ping pong and badminton
tourneys. Golf, archery, and soft-
ball are slated for the spring.

Swish on your Waylllennaiil.’  
O by Elizabeth Woodward

America's fbremost authority on young people’: problems

In a world without mirrors...and men...YOU should
bother ’bout beauty! That’s for us land lassiesmwho watch
its reflection in the eyes of the observer. '

So out of our way! You were born beautiful...we have
to work at it. It’: a strain and a struggle‘ to be as sleek as
you are...as streamlined...as graceful with our pedal ex-
tremities. We’re up against eyebrows that straggle...shiney noses...
limp locksmcollars that .wiIt...polish that chips...and clothes that
rumple. Our dozens of details can spell DILEMMA!

Why fret, you ask? Why not take it easy? Why not let well enough

Some of us weren’t born with faces that launch a thousand ships.
Some of us drew voices like foghorns. Some of us displace more than
our share of room. Some of us were dealt out hair like seaweed. Why
settle for that...is what we want to know? Not when we can do

Maybe we can’t alter the basic shape of our faces and ﬁgures. But we
can curry and groom them until they fool a few folks into thinking
it’s beauty. Not rule of thumb beauty. We want to be interesting to
look at...and interesting to know. That means a slick exterior...
the handbox look. And inside...no frowsy thinkingmno gooey emo-
tions...no scatterbrained personal relationships. We want no rough
edges . ..we want to he manicured to the ears! '

And that takes work! But it's worth it when
