Merchants

Affirm S. C.
Buying Plan

By AL PLEFFLER

Pitt students will be entitled
to a 10% discount on goods
and services purchased from
20 contracted Pittsburgh mer-
chants starting Monday, Apr.
25. ‘

The 20 merchants have
agreed to give a special discount
to students of the ﬁve local col-
leges. that will mean at least a
10% saving for all under-graduate
students who patronize the con-
tracted cleaners, clothing shops,
shoe stores and specialty mer-
chants.

Eight Stores Sign

Eight of the store owners have
already signed contracts with Al
Boll, chairman of the Student
Congress Discount committee, and
other representatives of the five
schools, agreeing to discounts in»
some cases above the 10% limit.
Boll is also sure of six other mer-
chants who have not yet returned
their contracts, and expects the
remaining doubtfuls to be con-
tacted before Monday. ,

Discount c a r d s, purchased
from the National, Student As-
sociation, will be ‘available to
all undergraduate -students who
present their ID cards at the
student desk. However, only one
will be allotted per person.

Stores contacted include Price’s
Oakland Store for women; Leon-
ard’s Men’s Store; Verner’s Shoe

1 Store and branches, who also have

a credit system; Camera Ex-
change; Segman’s Cleaners; Honus
Wagner’s Sports Shop; Crawley’s
Shoe Store; and Bauer Optician.
Poll Indicates Need
Approximately 35 ﬁrms were
originally contacted as a result of
a recent SC poll circulated
throughout the university. An
overwhelming response, 2300 re-
plies were filled out by Pitt men
and women who listed the items
which they would most prefer to
purchase at discount prices.

Poll results were judged in
conjunction with similar polls
conducted at Duquesne, PCVV,
Carnegie Tech and Mt. Mercy.
So the 20 stores which respond-
ed to student requests are the
choices of Pittsburgh college
students.

follow the theme of the Festival,
“The Great Forty—eight,” will be

The parade will be based on his-
torical beliefs that have developed
into legends concerning peopleor
events of the U. S. before 1900.

val to Legend Land.”

the Schenley Park Monument and
circle the Plaza twice in passing

fraternity and sorority competi-
tion keener than ever. The
floats will be judged for accu-
racy in portraying the theme,
following the rules, safety in
construction, and originality.

Many sororities are teaming up

Survey Poses Question

Student Unions

By CECY LINCOFF

In a recent survey conducted
throughout the country on the
need for student unions on college
campuses it was said, “Every fea-
ture of a student union building
should be challenged from the
standpoint of what it offers to
the development of young people.”

It continued by saying that stu-
dents are not in classrooms and

laboratories all the time. It is for

this reason that a university is the
place to maintain a’ proper social
environment and also make its
buildings and campus as attrac-
tive as possible. 
Facilities Seen

Facilities which have been em-
ployed in various student unions
throughout’ the country include
gamerooms and lounges for stu-
dent relaxation; cafeterias, dining
rooms, and snack bars in which
hot meals are served; student or-
ganization offices; c o n f e r e n c e
rooms; faculty clubs, and theaters.

the Dean of Men, is advisor.

Challenged On Development

At C a s e Institute everyone
had to go off-campus for meals
until the construction of the
union building. Now they have
a cafeteria, snack bar, private
dining rooms, faculty dining
rooms, and kitchen.

For student relaxation they
have a lounge, auditorium, sup-
per club, movie theater, and con-
cert hall. One entire wing of the
building is the" studert activities
center. i

Students Have Say

A student group, called the
Board of Managers, plan the stu-
dent program. Both faculty and
students use building for meetings
and parties. Each room is a.. per-
manent one in which seperate
activities are conducted through-
out the day. " '

Miami University reports that
their student union rooms» are the
living rooms of the small city .of
people-away-from home.

All of the unions surveyed
reported that their architecture

was done very simply, both on
the exterior and interior.
The social room of each unit
b e c 0 me s interchangeable at
Northern Michigan to facilitate

more extensive use. At this school’

the Student Union is consedered
the “Crossroads of the Campus.”
It’s the place to meet, chat, and
relax.
Parking Featured

Another feature of student
unions throughout the country is
underground parking garages such

as that at University of Minnesota. I
A portunity of self expression to

Commenting on the import-
ance of student union functions
was Dr. Carl S. Ell, president

of Whitman College. “Studentm

center was built to s e rv e ex-
clusively the welfare of the stu-
dents in their out-of-class activ-
ities.” *

Other student union buildings
house chapels, bookstores, mailing
rooms, and open ﬁre places. Physi-
cal education centers, cooking

with fraternities to have one float
entry this year, instead of sepa-
rate entries, as was usually the
case in past years. Should a joint
entry take one of the three prizes,
duplicate trophys will be pre-
sented to the winning fraternity
and sorority.
Americarnival Follows

The night after the float parade,
May 10,‘ wil kick off four nights
of “Americarnival,” which will be
held on the campus lawn. The
themes of diﬁerent states, with
their aspects of historical and so-
cial life, will be portrayed. The
draws have already been held for
land sites and most organizations
have started working on their
shows of “Americarnival.”

Fantasy About

Mountain Folk
“Dark of the Moon”

Set in Mountains

By BERNICE M. COHEN
When the curtain goes up
for “Dark of the Moon,” a
fantasy of Smoky Mountain
folk, 28 members of Pitt Play-

ers will step out of their
everyday—roles as students
into the mountain-top land
where the ancient Barbara Allen
story is relived.

Future engineers, doctors, and
journalists at the University of
Pittsburgh will make up the cast
of witches and mountaineers in
Berney and Rich,ardson’s former
Broadway hit.

“Dark of the Moon” is the
tale of John, the witch boy, who
is given the power to be human

s in order to marry Barbara Allen.

Barbara, the most beautiful girl
in the mountains, must remain
faithful to John f(ﬂ' a full year
or he will be changed back into
a witch. A
“This student activity type of
training in drama,” said Harvey
Pope, director, “allows a great op-

students in many ﬁelds of inter-
est.”
Elias Heads Cast

Heading the cast of “Dark of the
Moon” are Sheila Elias, Ed Bach-
man, Ben Tatar, and Harvey Klein.
Miss Elias, Col. ’55, will play the
role of Barbara Allen. 

She has been active in Pitt ‘
Players for three years. She has
played major roles in “Blithe

Petro Wins
Presidency

0fNew MC

Lack of Opposition

Gives Acclamation

Dimitri Petro headed the
list of men elected to execu-
tive posts in Men’s Council
Wednesday afternoon. With
only 15 of the 22 MC members
present to vote, the following
executive committee posts
were ﬁlled: president, vice presi-
dent,‘ recording secretary, treas-
urer, and corresponding secretary.

’ DIMITRE PETRO
New MC President

Petro, Col. ’56, who was the top
vote-getter in the recent MC gen-
eral elections, received no oppo-
sition for his post as MC presi-
dent. Gave Guyol, Bus. Ad. ’57,
was nominated for the post, but he
chose to step down. Thus Petro
was declared president by accla-
mation.

Filling the title of vice pres-
identrequired a vote, however.
Guyol was elected over his op-
ponent, Lynn Watson, Col. ’57..

Danny O’Connor, Ed. ’57, was
then elected recording secretary
over his opponent Joe Anania, Bus.
Ad. ’56. Ted Jamison was the
unanimous choice for treasurer, as
he, like Petro, was elected by
acclamation.

The ﬁfth spot on the execu-
tive committee was won by Bob
Ferber, Ed. ’57, as he was elect-
ed corresponding secretary over
his opponent Lynn yvatson.

The elections were the main
order of business for the new MC
members. The next Men’s Coun-
cil meeting will be Wednesday,
Apr. 20, at 3;30 p.m. .

Association

Pitt’s Women’s -Self Governing
Association became a member of
the Intercollegiate Association of
Women Students by petitioning
tha national convention, held Apr.
6-10 at the University_of Kansas.

Popie Papandreas and LaVerne

Dunten, newly elected president,

and vice—president of WSGA, at-
tended the convention. ‘The theme
was: “These things we can do.”
Schools from 42 states were repre-
sented to hear Dr. Arthur Adams,

, president of the American Coun-

cil of Education, and Mrs. Ern-
estine Gilberth Carey, author of
“Cheaper by the Dozen” speak on
the theme.

The move, considered to be of
major importance by women
here is expected to produce con-
tacts with other universities
that will broaden the coed pro-
gram socially and educationally.

Dr. Adams challenged women
student organizations to be ‘.‘more
concerned with education than
social function.”

Primary purposes of the LA.-
W.S. are to consider problems
relating to the responsibilities or
women students in local, national,
and international areas of concern
and to foster the exchange of ideas
on a programming basis. A plan
is now under way in the organi-
zation to divide itself into districts
which will sponsor annual re-
gional conferences to’ establish
better relations with individual
schools.

In‘ a joint statement, officers
Papandreas and Dunton voiced

hearty support for the union: I

“Our membership in the IAWS
has already begun to prove its
worth. - ,
“After spending fourdays with
student and adult leaders from 42
states, we have come back with a
wider, more integrated picture of

gwomen student organizations and
gzs better understanding of the po-
‘ iential w o r t h in the university

community.”

A Phi 0 Sponsors
Ugly'.Ma:n. Contest

Appointments for pictures for

the Ugly Man Contest should be ‘

made with Miss Turley in the
DOM office the week of Apr. 18.
‘All organizations have been in-
vited to select a candidate as a
representative. Make up will be
provided for the pictures .which

must be taken on Monday,,Tues--

day. or Wednesday, Apr. 18, 19,

"|'ve been practicing catchin' flies like you said. coach.
but I think I caught somebees. too."

A ml Tumult Cease ".

“Theishouting and the tumult cease.” ,

Only three days have passed since the announcement
from.Ann Arbor which proclaimed to a tense and hopeful
world the unquestionable success of Dr. Jonas Salk’s polio
vaccine. And already many have accepted and dismissed
the almost unbelievable fact that the killer has fallen
under the ax of medical progress. Mankind has cried out
in fear and received a reassuring pat on the head, that-he
need fear no longer.

But the man who delivered those words of reassurance
has not dismissed the years of research nor the invaluable

_aid given by his associates’.

For almost 50 years, research scientists have been get-
ting no quarter from the ruthless crippler. Just 20 years
ago medical science thought that it had the answer. A
large scale test was conducted. The answer was wrong.
And the resultant failure set their research back many
years, for they had not onlyto retrace their steps in ex-
perimentation, but also to reassure a populace which had
hoped for a cure and had received nothing.

Then it was found that’ there was not only one type
of polio with which to deal but three. Instead of slowing
the research, they expanded and began investigating all
three types with an even more thorough eye than the
had previously exercized. -

And so it went,» defeats, blind alleys, and minor yic.--

“tories until the summer of 1952 when the words “Gamma

Globulin” haunted the” thoughts of a nation in'the grip
of one of the most fatal polio epidemics in history.

Then, in 1954, came the ﬁeld trials of a new vaccine,
ﬁeld trials so extensive that they encompassed.1,800,000
subjects. A doubting world began to believe.

Three days ago, literally thousands of people were
granted a reprieve, a reprieve from a painful death or, at
best, a crippled existence. And already many have ac-

cepted this reprieve with a muted thanks and turned their

thoughts to other things. But not‘ so the men responsible
for the vaccine. _.

There remains much to be done. Research is now be-
ing continued on a more potent vaccine which will relegate
polio to the ranks of smallpox and “diptheria. -“The shout-
ing and the tumult cease”. but Dr. Jonas Salk and his
colleagues are continuing their unending ﬁght against polio
and other diseases which breed within the mind of man
a fear which only men of their calibre” can dispell.

. .You r 

By Irv Rothman, ,

We owe much to the English for government
and literature, that should not be denied. But Pitt
women owe a great deal more. For the past 29
years, they have sponsored a British Coronation
ceremony to pay homage to the senior woman who
best typiﬁes the high quality female this university
strives to produce.

Each year the exclusive pa-
geant is held before graduation.
Co-eds bedecked in gay-colored
robes gather in the Commons
Room to crown the “Senior
Qeen,” parallel of ODK “Man oi
the Year.” Guardians, marshalls,_
and trainbearers form the en-
tourage which accompanies the
candidate to the throne where
she reecives orb, scepter and
position as ruler of co-eds.-

‘ Ever So Humble

The ceremony serves as the climax of four
years training. From freshman days, woman are
imbued with the idea that they might some day
so be honored with a place on the pulpit along
with the Queen. No one is vain enough to think
that she might eventually. be queen.

However, though the Commons Room may pro-
vide proper setting for it, the coronation is out
of place in a modern university. It is a costly ex-
travaganza, a musical production, a puppet-like
display. Speaking parts are traditional and memor-
ized. Even the audience knows beforehand when
to pound their staves and shout the clasiscal term,

dd led   Ma sses"

 

Herald Search Out Queen

Actually the coronation is an anti-climax be-
cause the Queen is announced on Tap Day when
heralds search her out in the audience. That, an-
nouncement is sufficient to‘,.impress upon the stu-
dent body the Value of the gesture. E

Everyone who knew her agreed that Pat Ritz
deserved the title last year. She exempliﬁed the
ideal leader, student, ., and lady. She not only
showed leadership among» the twelfth ﬂoor con-
stituents, but was a forceful representative in
Student Congress. The Queen. will always be, as in
the past, such a woman.

What's The Reason? .

But just what is‘ being proven through the
rituals! If women are striving for glory, then
the ceremonies are an appropriate climax; if thbir
aspirations are to fulﬁll the virtues of woman-
hood, it is unnecessary.

Should such an extravaganza be the Want of
co-eds here, why not bring it closer to home for
the sake of guests of the University? I have my
ideas, and certainly nothing cansbe more radical
than singing “God Save the Queen” in deference
to the “Alma Mater.”

Elect a “Miss Final Exams.’ She would be
placed upon a pedestal with a torch in one hand
and a book in the other. Instead of singing to
the Queen, it would be more patriotic to recite
to weary students the words: “Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe
free.’ That’s‘ more palatable to my “brain-washed”
American mind. ‘

Entered as '

 

“Good Save the Queen.” »«
I especially object to the Queen having to
swear before the Holy Bible her «loyalty and duty

to the University.

By Cecy Lincoff

It now appears that Pitt has
found a place for itself on the
map. It has ascended the heights
properly assumed by institutions
of note. It didn’t just happen, it’s
been happening since the mas-
sive Gothic structure was built.
But it wasn’t
until Tuesday
the m an on
t h e street
realized that
s o In e t hing
was actually
being done in
t h a t tower
which domi-
nates the city
skyline. ‘

Actually it
wasn’t any-
thing that was done in ' the
Cathedral that brought Tues-
day’s famée to the University, but
in a building on another hill of
the city. a

Nevertheless, it was done by
a member of the University of
Pittsburgh faculty——Dr. Jonas E.
Salk. ‘

Pitt, it now seems, is really in
the national and international
news. The man on the street and
trolley riding Pittites now are
proudly smiling at the mere
mention of the word—Pitt.

The Man |nThe Street

Many Have Worked

It’s not only the workiof one
man and his staff that have sud-
denly put Pitt on the map, there
are others, trustees, students,
deans, professors, and a chan-
cellor———the link between
University to the community.

In past years a great insti-
tution of learning was built. Now
once again the blueprints are on
the drawing board. this time to
make Pitt a campus university.

It should have an atmosphere

conducive to study and living.-

It should be “a home away from
home”. From a student view-
point this is important.

Now the job is to make the

officials concerned aware of the
wishes of the students. Foriif
students are to live in Univers-
ity dormitories, work and relax
in the Student Union, than it
obviously should be built for the

' student. Up to this point every-
one is in agreement. Then the,

question of facilities and archi-
tecture is disturbed. l;lere’s were
the disagreement begins.

Functionality The Keynote
Functionality is s c r e a m e (1

are two sides. Which is more

center back in 1904, one of the
conditions of the grant provided
that the group of societies would
“perpetually maintain” its head-
quarters in New York.

Legal Action Threatened
Using this slim antiquated
idea, the attorney generalwof
New York State, Jacob K. Javits,
has threatened to use
action against the societies trans-
ferring their headquarters. The

attorney general has declared,
"The wishes of a donor of a
charitable f u n d should‘ b e

respected.”-

The four groups include the
American Society of Civil En-
gineers,
Mining and Metalurgical En-
gineers, Institute of Electrical
Engineers and the American So-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers.
Another society, the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers
will join them if the transfer
goes through.

Other New York officials said

the proposed transfer wouldbe

 

the

legal ‘A

rowed froin our English brethren, but as far as
this‘ columnist is concerned, lend-lease should end

the same room used for ping.
pong in the morning, band re-
hersal in the afternoon‘, a din-
ner meeting in the evening, and
a formal at night——thus pushing
out any student who might want

to play ping pong in the after-'

noon" or early evening. The
question here it would seem is
what is the functionality serv-
ing—the student or the plan of
a building.‘

Problems Are Many —

This is only one of the prob-
lems. Proposed architecture is
another. Again the quar1'el-5¥-
Gothic to ﬁt in‘with the Com‘-
mons Room and over-all cathe-
dral structure or contemporary
modern design to follow the
moods of this and future gen-
erations. If it is to be the home
away from home” that the Pitt
student wishes, let’s see how
many future students come from
homes bearing Gothic architec-
ture.

     

It’s a very confused situation _

-—are' plans for or against‘ the
student body?

After some thought the answer
will probably be in favor of
uniting. Then Pitt will have an-
other notch in its belt and a
real campus school can be added
to the list of reasons, such as
Salk and Fitzgerald, of which
Pitt can most surely be proud.

fought in the‘Ne.w York State

Supreme Court, which must ap-
prove any plan of the engineer'-

ing societies to sell their present C

headquarters.

Now recently the presidents
of the l'ou1; groups recommended
to theirboards of directors that
headquarters should be trans-
ferred to Pittsburgh because of
a lack of space in the present
building.

Gateway Offered

ln'good faith and not just for

spite. interested parties in Pitts-

burgh have ‘oﬁ'e_red these so-
cieties a new building in the
Gateway center with ample

space to carry out their func-
tions. The pledges add up to over
two million dollars for the site
of the new headquarters and_for
construction of the new build-
ing.

Dav.id hasn’t,

and probably

will not, use his slxingshot, for
Goliath seems to be, losing the
ﬁght in the eyes of the engineers .
by ‘using his stalling tactics.

rookies holding down starting

Thus,’ the fans can justly look for a much—improved,

‘more-experienced group of grid-O—.———~—~~~

ders to be cavorting the back pas-
ture this fall.

Cost at Left Half —
Obviously, one of the first posi-
tions to raise a question is the
left halfback spot vacated by cap-

understudy was Wilkinsburg’st
Corky Cost. As second "fiddle to
Ford, a soph usually doesn’t get
to play much but Cost did see a

good bit of action in the latter,

part of the campaign.
Backing up Cost at the left half
post is soph Jim Theodore who did
quite a job for Steve Petro’s fresh-
men e l e v e 11 last season. Right
alongside Theodore is an o t h e r
soph-—Dick Bowen—a converted
quarterback who will probably see
duty at both positions this year’.

Passodelis at Right Half

Moving over to the right half-
back post. which was handled last
season by second-year map Bugs
Bagamery, the job se"§ms to be
changing hands. At present the
post goes to ,Aliquippa’s Nick Pas-
sodelis who last year ﬁlled in at
that post when Bagamery injured
his hand.

Seniors Show Well

Up till now in the spring drills
Bagamery has been hampered
somewhat by a back injury and as
a result is getting some rough
competition from a pair of seniors
—-Lou Cimarolli and Ray DiPas—
quale. Cimarolli, who was leading
Panther ground-gainer in 1951 be-
fore his Navy sojourn, has been
switched from his usual left half
post and is now making a, strong

' i

bid for the starting right half post. ,
DiPasquale, who earned a letter '

in ’53 but didn’t see action last
year, has been showing well in the
spring workouts and should make
things tough in ﬁghting for a
berth on the ’55 eleven. -
Big Battle at Fullback

Another pair of seniors who are
bidding for halfback spots are
Franklin’s Dick Manson and Pea-
body High’s Pete Neft. Manson
earned a letter in ’53 at that posi-
tion while Neft is a converted
quarterback who garnered letters
in ’52 and ’53 at that post.

' Sliding over to the all-important
fullback position, the battle seems
to be shaping up between senior
Bob Grier and junior Tom Jenk-

Also expected to be heard from
is sophomore Tirrel Burton who
last year tied for ninth—best low
hurdle mark in the nation with
23.4, did the century in 9.9, and
consistently high jumps over six

With all these stars, the locals
will have to pin their hopes for
victory on depth and Arnie
Sowell. The Jungle Cats have
been steadily improving and Olson
emphasized the fact that every
man will have to go all out if they

Besides Sowell, main hopes of

Coach Dave McCormick’s golf-
ers have high hopes’ of starting

_ another long win streak tomorrow

when they visit the West Virginia
Mountaineers. The linkers are out
to equal the nineteen, defeatless
meets which they compiled over
a two-year span preceding last
year’s ﬁnal match.

Prior to the 4-3 defeat at the
hands of Penn State in the ﬁnals,
the Panther string was marred
only ‘by two ties—-both at the
hands of the Mounties. West Vir-
ginia also has the dubious distinc-
tion of having started the locals’
win streak.

  

Golfers Out To i,Renew,Strealc 

  Over Mountaineer Course”

It began during the 1953 season
when the Blue and Gold staged a
41/g-41/2 tie with WVU and then
defeated them 6-3 in the next
match. In the following seventeen
tilts, another 41/2-41,§ tie with the
same team last season‘ was the
only blot on the linkers’ record.

Having already dropped the
season opener to Navy last Sat-
urday, the Panthers must makea
strong showing tomorrow to in-
sure another successful campaign
as the Mountaineers will also
furnish the opposition when the
duﬁers open their home season
Wednesday, Apr. 27, at the,Shan-
nopin Country Club.

As Sowell, Mates
Get Coliseum Bid

The scheduled Pitt-Penn State
track meet, originally set for Sat-
urday, May 21, has been resched-
uled for the preceding Wednes-
day, May 18.

Reason for the change is that
star Panther half-miler Arnie
Sowelland the crack relay team

have been invited to the Coliseum,

Relays in Los Angeles Friday,
May 20.
Sowell will most likely run

against Mel Whitﬁeld and Lon
Spurrier, former college greats
whom he beat in the Pan-American
Games, in the Paciﬁc Coast 880-
yard event.

The Panther, athletic depart-
ment got Penn State’s consent since
without Sowell and the mile relay
in the dual meet the Pittites would
be greatly handicapped. The
match will still be held at Pitt

Riflers Match‘ Sights WithWVU

In First Place War Tomorrow

After out-shooting Ohio State, a leading contender for
riﬂe honors in the Big Ten Conference, 1391-1384, Sgt. Joe

Gromko"s shooters are favored to¢

top West Virginia and Washington
& Jefferson in a triangular meet
at ,Morga‘ntown tomorrow.

At present the Panthers are
tied with West Virginia for second
place in the Greater Pittsburgh
Rifle League and, should they cop
the meet tomorrow, they will
ﬁnish the season tied for the lead
with\Duquesne. If a shoot-oﬂfl is
necessary, it will be held on a
neutral range early in May.

James Cleary, Tom Shepard,
and James Flynn le-d the locals to
their closewin over the Buckeyes
last Saturday. Sgt. Gromko felt
that his boys showed champion-
ship form in winning. “If we can
continue this pace we’ll take both
the Greater Pittsburgh League
championship and the NRA out-
door championship,” he stated.

Sgt. Gromko was referring to
the National Riﬂe Association
outdoor tournament to be held at
the Rbsedale Range, May 10. “We
won it with the same boys‘ last

‘year, and the added year of ex-

perience should make us. even
tougher for the opposition,” com-
mented Gromko.

The other members who have
contributed to the riﬂers success
this season are Tom Klaric, Dave
‘Johnson, Dick Green, Bob Zwah-.
len, Al Johnson, George Evans,
and Dick Konis.

 

._......

When Panther half-miler Arnie
Sowell and the mile relay team
travel to Los Angeles Friday,
May 20, for the Coliseum Relays,
it will mark the third outdoors
relay that Panther tracksters have
entered this year. By that time
the thinclads will have already
competed in the Ohio and Penn
Relays.
