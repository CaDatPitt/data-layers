Lawmakers Appear Ready to Debate Thornburgh Budget

Bv TOM KUKUCKA

Pitt News Slaffwriler

House and Senate members
appear ready to square off with

I Gov. Richard Thornburgh’s 1979-

80 budget. and the losers, as was
the case two summers ago, could
be Pitt and other state-related

" schools. ‘

crease, Park said, approval of the
budget could be delayed as late as
August. A

Thornburgh’s budget accounts
for the “self-destruct” tax clause
written into the 1977-78 budget,
which is set to expire at the end of
this year.

This “self-deslrucl” tax, which
indirectly aids state-related schools
calls for a 2.2 percent personal tax
and a 10.5 percent corporate tax. It

ans “have the ball,” according to
Park.

“The Republicans are in the
drivers seat and the Democrats are
going to lay back and see what
happens,” Park said.

Members of the Public and
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee, led by chairman Jeff Miller
and lobby coordinator Martin
Bertochi, will travel to the capitol
tommorow to lobby, particularly

Chancellor Posvar will appear
before that committee Apr. 5.

“Basically we will take the
approach of what Pitt does for the
economy in the city of Pittsburgh,”
Miller said.

Pitt is the largest employer in the
city, generating nearly $102.2
million each year for the state and
$27.8 million for the city and
county.

sylvania’s budget will take next
year.

new Republican members who
were elected on a “no-tax
increase” platform. And a no-tax
budget could spell hard times for
Pitt, an institution already strug-
gling with lower enrollment,

It will be Thornburgh and his.

The budget includes a 4.7
percent increase in appropriations
for the state-related universities
and a seven increase for state-
owned schools, but, most dis-
tressing to Demolcrat and Republi-
can legislators alike, a six percent
tax on gas. This stipulation could
cause delays in funding for Pitt and
other schools.

“Right now there is a lot of

disatisfaciion with the. governor
from both parties,” said Student
Government Board member Todd
Park, A

Park, as former chairman of the
SGB’s Public Governmental Rela-
tions Committee, has participated
in several lobby trips to Harrisburg
and has studied voting trends
among both parties.

According to Park, the legislat-

E ‘ors disatisfaction stems not only

from the gas tax, but also the
uncertainty as to exactly where the
money from that tax will go.

methods” and clariﬁes the in-

summer of 1977 initially opposed a
tax increase. When the budget
fight dragged on through Novem-
ber, Republicans gave in to a
“short term” tax that would expire
before 1980.

Thornburgh is counting on
passage of HB-608, a bill intro-
duced by Allegheny County "Rep.
George Pott. This bill would lower
the personal tax to 2.1 percent and
keep the corporate tax at 10.5.

Passage of the bill, according to
Park, “seems to be difficult but
probable,” and ifit does not go
through, Pitt and other schools, as
non-preferred status members
would be hurt the most.

As “non-preferred” status insti-
tutions, state-related schools are
not guaranteed a certain percent-
age of the budget, but must rely on
appropriations set aside in the
general fund.

The House, controlled by Repub-
licans, will be first in line to vote on
Thornburgh’s budget. Unlike two

Peace Treaty in the Middle East: A Dream Nearing Reality

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON - Egyptian President

Minister Moshe Dayan said in a television
interview that the exact timetable for

about the a three-part signing ceremony
in which he and Sadat would leave

Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin prepared to sign a

.treaty today to end 30 years of war
between their countries and, they hoped,

lay the cornerstone of peace in the Middle
East.

The treaty they_planned to sign did not .
come easily. The bargaining lasted until
late Sunday evening as the two ancient
enemies haggled over the final details of
their new and fragile peace.

As a result, the text of the treaty was
not to be made public until after Sadat,
Begin and President Carter met at the
White House and sat down at a table
purchased by Ulysses S. Grant to sign
three versions, in English, Hebrew and
Arabic.

They planned to celebrate the ocassion

, with a state dinner this evening with

1,300 guests under a red and yellow tent
on the South Lawn of the White House.
“This is the day we hoped for. Let\us

. rejoice," said Begin.

But until late Sunday evening, there
seemed some chance tonight’s cele-
bration might not be held.

On Sunday morning, Israeli Foreign

Greek Week has passed and the Cancer
Society is $30,000 richer thanks to the efforts
of Pitt fraternities and sororities. Big winners in
the week of events included a coalition of Delta
Delta Delta, Phi Gamma Delta and Alpha Epsilon
Pi in the chugging contest. Representatives pf
Pi Kappa AIpha,Delta Zeta and Triangle took

p honors in the singing competition of talent night,
i ’ while Sigma Chia nd Chi Omega joined to win the

comedy competition. Photographer Dave Blais
catches the action of Greek Week—-page 8.

Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai oilﬁelds
had not been settled and that he did not

think Israel should sign the treaty until

that question was resolved.

Begin arrived at Andrews Air Force
Base outside Washington a few hours
later in a light rain and added a few more
issues to the agenda. .

He said he wanted to talk to Sadat

Washington to sign the Arabic and
Hebrew versions of the treaty in Cairo
and Jerusalem. He said Sadat and Carter
had agreed to this idea.

Begin also said he wanted to open the
borders between Egypt and Israel 10
months after ratification of the treaties so
Egyptians might visit Israel and Israelis

might gaze at the Pyramids, “in which «
their forefathers invested some labor.”

Shortly after 6 p.m., Begin arrived at
the Egyptian Embassy, where Sadat was _
staying. The two leaders conferred until
7:35, when Begin, his expression‘ grim,
got into his car and drové/ back to his
hotel.

During the conversation, Begin appar-
ently gave up on his plan to get Sadat to
visit Jerusalem. Israeli and Egyptian
spokesmen announced that Begin would
make a one-day visit to Cairo on April 2 to
repaySadat’s historic visit to Jerusalem in "
November 1977. All three versions of the

I treaty would be signed at the White
House. _

The spokesmen would — not ‘disclose
"what the two said about the oil issue, but
Begin’s spokesman, Dan Pattir, said the
issue was still open.

A short time later, Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance arrived at the hotel to confer
with Begin, repeating a visit he had paid
in New York on Saturday night.

When Vance emerged, he and Dayan
were smiling. There would be a treaty-
signing, .Vance said. Asked if the
oil-fields problem had been settled,
Vance responed, “I believe it has.”

Although Israel and Egypt are expected to sign
a historical peace treaty today, Israel will face a
different sort of battle on the homefront in late
June. Coach Tim Grgurich announced yester-
day that the Panther basketball team would be
traveling to Israel in June to play members of the
Israeli Olympic team or Israeli national team
hopefuls in a roundball tournament.

Middle East are still uncertain, but either
graduating seniors or new recruits might make
the -trip. -page11.

Although Pitt students celebrated the advent
of spring last week with short sleeves and cut-off
jeans, they must bundle up to face the un-
seasonably frigid weather expected today. The
,_weather forecast predicts partly cloudy and cool
temperatures in the 30s and 40s. The begin-
ning of the first full week of spring also brings
with it the slight chance of snow flurries. The
most lucky of Pitt students are the few who can
escape the early spring chill on a short trip to the
golden beaches of Florida.

SGB Rejection
  Laudable Choice

The Student Government ~Board’s rejection of the
recommended budgets for the seven governance
groups is a laudable decision and the only justifiable
one, considering the great discrepancies between the
allocations for such groups as the Inter-Fraternity

If the recommendations of the Allocations Com-
mittee ‘had been approved by the SGB, the univer-
sity’s Greeks would have been the big winners‘. IFC,
the ‘Panhellenic Association and Greek Week would
have received $5,000 more than they did last year and
the BAS would have gotten $4,200 less. This drastic
shift in funding priorities cannot be excused when the
different programs offered by the various gover-
nance group are examined.

Most of the IFC and Greek Week programs
recommended for funding are of questionable value
for the majority of Pitt students. The IFC would
have been given $1,500 for rush recruitment
manuals, $590 to send representatives to a conven-
tion and $560 for building alumni solidarity. In ad-
dition, the Greek Week formal would have been un-
derwritten by the SGB to the tune of $2,500.

lWhile these programs may be worthwhile, they

would probably benefit only the Greeks on cam-
pus—a small minority--and should not be funded
with activities fees paid by all students.

The BAS programs cutby the Allocations Com-
mittee were a much more broad and inclusive lot.
Some of the items the society planned were a black
history week speaker for $f,600, the Nia Dance En-
sernble for $2,000 and speakers for a writer’s forum
for $2,400. These programs would not only benefit
the’ BAS’ small constituency, but also the whole
university community if all interested students at-
tended the programs. ‘ —

Student government’s immediate concern should
be to fund those programs that can benfit all
students and the BAS’ programs are those that show
the most promise of reaching that end. Therefore, it
is the duty of the SGB to shift priorities so that the
worthwhile plans of the action society receive sup-
port.

This changein priorities would not only be a gain
for programs that could benefit all students, but

- would also mark the slowing of student government’s
increasing preference for the mostly exclusive ac-
tivities of such governance groups as the IFC,
Panhellenic Association, and the Engineering
Student Cabinet. This shift can be seen in these
groups’ budget increases.

In the fiscal year 1976-77, the Engineering Student
Cabinet received $540 from the son, while $33,800
was this year’s recommended budget. Other
enlightening comparisions for the two years are:
Panhellenic Association, $930 in 1976-77 to $4,200
recommended this year; IFC, $1,900 in 1976-77 to
$5,300 recommended this year; and Greek Week

‘ $2,400 in 1976-77 to $6,000 recommended this year.

The result of this shift has been funding for such
activities of dubious value as a polka party for the
engineers at a cost of $300 while speakers and
cultural events planned by BAS have lost financial
support. We only hope that the Allocations Commit-
tee will show concern overthis unjustifiable shift to
support questionable programs and greatly revamp
its suggestions when it submits recommendations for
the second time Wednesday.

Guest Column

By JOSEPH C. HEIM

l
Webster’s Dictionary defines
efficacy as the ‘ ‘capacity to produce

’ desired results of change.” Effi-
-cacy, or a sense of it, is in many

ways the most precious value, and
one,‘ which is sadly and strongly
lacking not only in the fiber of our
society, but in the individuals of
our society as well. Indeed, this

- erosion of efficacy may in the end

be the “cancer” of our society.
Efficacy had long been a quality
of American
socialization. The sense of ‘ ‘I or we
can” enabled us to constantly build
and expand. A sense of efficacy

seemed to emanate from .such.

leaders as Robert Kennedy and
Martin Luther King.

Every American mother hoped
her son would become president of
the United States. There was a
widely held belief, that agreed with
Chicago’s lyrics, “we can change
the world now, we can make it
happen...”

But, today, it seems as if efficacy
is no longer present, and is equated
with naivete. What has caused this
erosion of efficacy? Perhaps it was
the fires of Vietnam and the race
riots that seared our conscience.
Undoubtedly, the rigid constraints
of inflation limited not only our
dollar's purchasing power, but our
broad vision as well.

The decreasing job market

decreased one’s identity and in the
scramble, one tends to be just a
number. Or perhaps it was simply
because our dreams became larger
than ourselves and we killed them,
rather than having our perceived
smallness measured against them.
The result of this has been an
erosion of efficacy that has
permeated not only our society, but
the individuals of society as well.
Evidence of this erosion clearly
abounds. According to a recent
survey by a highly prestigious
international relations quarterly,
only three percent of those
surveyed really ‘believed that they

could change their,lives or “better

society.” 1
Loss of awareness is yet another

symptom. After all, why should
one care about things that one can
do nothing about is the prevalent
attitude. Evaluating the same
survey, the editors concluded that

the amount of concern with the,

“direction of America” was minis-
cule at best.

A major syndrome of this erosion
of efficacy is the fact that most
believe that it is only a very few of
us who “can do”; and they usually
have such names as Mellon or
Rockefeller. Thousands vicariously
attain their “can do” through
television or by being a sports
spectator. Often institutions
encourage such a view.

One especially noted financial
journal recently stated that an
international lending officer for
a major multinational commercial
bank was in effect an “internation-

'al god,” determining who would

succeed and who would fail.
Needless to say, not many aspire to
be international lending officers.

Often the only desire is to eke out
a comfortable living in one’s own
little niche, totally oblivious of
other events that shape not only
society, but its value system as
well. Such a limited desire, is in
the end, damning.

Still another aspect of this
erosion has been the decline in
moral confidence. Seen in this
light, even those rare few “who
can" are “doing ‘it for them-
selves.” In many ways Watergate
was but one manifestation of this.

Importantly, this erosion has not
been confined to certain segments
of our society, and even the most
enlightened also express this view.
For example Barnet and Muller. in
“Global Reach” assert that the
world is, in the end, dominated by

‘a few, who in the end will decide
‘ whether we will make it or break it.

Erosion of Efficacy Possible Cancer of American Society?

Such a view does much to dampen‘

expectations. - —

Such an erosion, if unchecked,
will in the end lead to a strong
sense of futility. The first
symptoms of this malaise is apathy.

One‘ need not despair, however.
What is lacking, in the end, is not
the capacity to produce desired
results of change, but only the
desire and perseverance needed to
fuel. that capacity. .

The development of this “fuel”
should be an essential part of the
university experience. This desire
is most strongly developed through
activities which promote such
efficacy,
Student Association and Greek
Week blood drives or the Greek
Week dance marathon, . which
raised a substantial amount of
money for the ‘American Cancer
Society. Inherent in these
programs is the belief that we can
do something for the betterment of
our society.

Making sure the fertile soil of the
human mind is resistant to the
erosion of efficacy is in the end one
of the most important tasks that we
face. As Robert Kennedy once
said, “Change is, in essence,
inevitable, whether, it is beneﬁcial,
is in the end dependent upon only
whether we care enough....”

Or as Medgar Evers once stated.
“One person cannot only be a
difference, one person can make a
difference...” Let us hope that we
will have the desire to make such a
difference.

Director of the Placement Center
has informed me, and as I have
seen with my own eyes, the
Center's phones have been ringing
off the hook with calls from
businessmen desiring to interview
on campus. These are employers
who, for the most part, were not
aware, prior to the Placement

they could use the Center to locate
qualified individuals to ﬁll posi-

that with the 190% rise in the

How The Pitt News can find fault

me.

Cuts of Graduate Employees Not Academically Viable

Every year, around April 1,
tension is high within the graduate
employee population at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, for it is at this
time that contract renewal deci-
sions are made. This year will be
no. different and may be even
worse. The proposed budget
allotment by the state of Pennsyl-
vania for the university in the
coming year is in effect smaller
than last year’s since ».the increase
does not even match the current
rate of inﬂation.

The university is already in

budget so only a worse situation
can be expected next year.
Regardless of the eventual state
appropriations, budget cuts and

clearly emerges.

For example, according to the
“University Times” (3/8/79), in
the $373,000 cut from the Faculty
of Arts and, Science budget
between fall and winter term,
part-time staff was cut by $50,000

Swanson   Acheiv   ' es All-America swim Status, Pitt 2611:

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt swimmers, despite the
efforts of All-America backstroker
Stu Swanson, ﬁnished a disap-
pointing 26th in last weekend‘s
NCAA championship at the Cleve-
land State Natatorium.

The Panthers, undefeated during

the dual meet season and the.

undisputed Eastern regional
champions, had hoped to crack the

top 20.

“We expected to do better,”
conceded Pitt swimmer Greg
Pelton. who accompanied the team
as an alternate. “We looked good
in practice and were really
psyched. I don’t know what
happened, but we just didn’t do
well.”

Swanson, the only Panther to
score in the three-day meet, was
the team’s lone bright spot. By

ﬁnishing 10th in the 200-yard
backstroke, Swanson became Pitt’s
ﬁrst All-America swimmer since
Jerry DeMuro in 1977.

Only one other Panther came
close to making All-America. Pat
Greenwell, competing in his ﬁrst
national championship, ﬁnished
13th in three-meter diving.

“Pat was super happy with the
meet he had,” Pelton said. “He

missed 12th place by three points,
which is equivalent to a swimmer
missing it by one-tenth of a
second.”

The rest of the Panthers,
however, weren’t as happy.

Expecting to do better. Mark
Schuman. l00—yard butterfly and
200-yard individual medley;
Mickey Termin, 100-yard butterﬂy

and both the 400-yard freestyle and I

400-yard medley relay team placed
among the top 25 in their events.

NCAA NOTES:Scott Winkler,
three-meter diving, didn’t compete
because of a thigh injury he
suffered at home last week.

California took the- team title.
Defending champion Tennessee
was fourth, while Southern Cali-
fornia and Florida were second and
third, respectively.

Panther Basketball
To Israel This June

Monday, March 26, 1979——Page 11

By MARIA SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

Plans for the Pitt basketball team

to play’ in Israel this summer are’

underway, according to head coach
Tim Grgurich.

“We’ve got the go-ahead to
make arrangements,” said Grgu-
rich. “So far as I know, we’ll be
making the trip from June 20
through June 30.”

First, the Panthers must get the

I go-ahead from the NCAA and a

national organization, ABA-USA.
The AB‘A-USA is an international
committee through which all
international tours must be
arranged.

“We’d probably be playing a
series of games with different
teams,” said Grgurich. “The
players of the Isreali teams would
be those on the Olympic team or
guys trying out for the'for the
national team.”

It is yet uncertain exactly which
Pitt athletes will be allowed to

» make the trip east.

“For now, we’re not sure exactly
who we can take or how many
players,” said Grgurich. 1

Obviously, Pitt without its
graduating senior players would
not be the same team that made it

to the Eastern Eight ‘championship.

game, but these considerations will
be made by ABA-USA.

Another possibility would be to
let the Panthers take along their
high school recruits, but since
recruits are not yet actual students,
it is only a remote one.

The Panthers last faced interna-
tional competition several seasons
ago when Pitt defeated a visiting
Yugoslavian national team.

Pitt Notes: The Panthers home
schedule for 1979-80 includes such
notables as Syracuse, Temple,
Duke and George Washington....
Pitt will play in a tournament at the
University of Connecticut...two

were considered.

Weeks Off May Cost Pitt Netminder Olynpics

Pitt goalie Larry Newell and teammate Curt Hetz are in Detroit.

Srakocic photo

‘reaction time will

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

When Pitt hockey player Larry
Newell puts on his goalie pads in

Detroit today and faces 39 others I

for a chance at the three netminder
spots on the 1980 United States
Olympic hockey squad, he will be
at a disadvantage. And the
disadvantage isn’t of his own
making, which makes him angry.

“There haven’t been any damn
games for three w’eeks—our
season’s over,” Newell said,
referring to the Panther hockey
club’s 1979 year. “I’m tired of
practicing——real tired. Now I’m just
going through the motions.”

Newell is a victim of the system.
Pitt hockey, being a club sport and
not of varsity status, must pay for
everything itself. That includes
money for hockey games, which the
club doesn’t have enough of to play
a long schedule, and cash for ice
time, which the club doesn’t have
for March practices.

So, as Newell’s competition
battles in the NCAA Tournament at
Detroit’s Olympia Stadium this
week, he must psyche himself "up.

That’s not easy to do when
you’ve been out of game competi-
tion for three weeks and ﬁnd
practice time too costly.

“Those guys coming off the
NCAA playoffs will be fired up,”
Newell said. “And since I haven’t
played in a game for a while, my
be a little
slower.”

Slow reaction time is bad news to
a goaltender. One off day at the

Olympic trials insures a goalie of

never making "the Olympic team.
It’s not that Newell is a mediocre

netminder, or that his talent is
suspect. University of Cincinnati
hockey coach Pat Rupp, himself an
Olympic goalie in the 1960s,
personally scouted and selected
Newell as a candidate for the 1980
team.

_ “He (Rupp) saw me play against
his Bearcat team and afterward
talked to me about the Olympic
trials,” Newell explained. “I was
able to pull out wins with this’ Pitt
team despite the fact that we

of the better teams we played and

we got outshot by a good margin.”

But if Newell fails to _make the
Olympic squad, inactivity could be
the cause. Even still, Newell likes
his chances of being
Olympics.

“There are some good guys
trying out as wingers and centers,”
Newell said, “but I can’t single out
one player who seems outstanding
to me.

“In fact, there’s no real
difference between their shots and
the shots of some of the guys on our

team. Nobody shoots the puck

harder that Curt Hetz (a Pitt center
who will be at the trials as well),
and I practice with him.”

Newell would like to fulﬁll the
hockey player’s dream and make
the Olympic team, but there is one
other thing on the line up at
Detroit_—a pro future. Newell feels
that if he can’t make the Olympic
squad, hopes of turning pro will be
destroyed. L,‘

By The Associated Press

SALT LAKE CITY—-Larry Bird &

1 Co., also known as top-ranked,

unbeaten Indiana State, do battle
with “Magic Man” Earvin Johnson
and his supporting cast from
Michigan State tonight for col-
legiate basketball supremacy, a
dream showdown pitting what may

4 be the two best teams and the two

greatest players in the game.

The nationally televised NCAA
championship will tip off at 9:15
’ p.m. in the Special Events Center
on the University of Utah campus,
preceded by the third—place game
between DePaul'and Penn.
Indiana State, the only team in

NCAA history to post a 33-0 record,
is the underdog. The Sycamores,
with‘ the 6-foot-9 Bird tossing in
points from all over the court, have
squeaked past their opponents,
edging Arkansas and DePaul on
last-second shots by unheralded
Bob Heaton, who habitually mater-
ializes at the most crucial moment
to save the day and then -returns to

_ obscurity.

The Spartans, 25-6, breezed into
the finals, routing Notre Dame in
the Mideast Regional and humil-
iating Penn in the ‘ semifinals
Saturday, 101-67. -

Against DePaul, Bird hit 16 of 19
ﬁeld goals, pouring in 35 points,

  Beaver Falls’ Young
   Breaks Hurdles Mark 

By MARIA SCIULLO
’ Pitt News Sports Editor
The "first" running event of the I
Pitt women’s high school track and

“ field invitational was almost
-underway when someone noticed a

key portion of track apparatus was
missing: the finish line tape.

/ While a strip of Pro-Wrap was
sought, the contestants of that first

8 race, the 60-yard hurdles, nervous-

13;‘ stood by their starting blocks,

except for one contestant. Sixteen-

year-old Candy Young, Beaver

Falls High School junior and holder ’
 of national and world records in the

hurdle events, was patiently
-waiting out the delay by turning
‘back walkovers in her lane.

‘If Young’s reputation and
apparent calm weren’t unsettling

, against.

. the hurdler’s time of 6.1, (a new

‘meet record set in that trial heat)
was especially intimidating to those
in the dozen or so hurdle trials that
followed. r
“This is sort of a fun meet for
Candy,” said her coach, Karlin
“With all the
serious, big-time meets she’s run

in the lastfew weeks, I’m glad high
school-season has started. She can
be part of a team now and not have
to worry about doing well under the

pressure of national competition.” V

Young had her fun Saturday
afternoon at the Pitt Field House.
After setting a meet record in the
hurdle trials, she went on to win
the 220- and 440-yard dash. The
latter was an impressive display of

_ Young’s sprinting ability; after one

lap she was in last place by as much
as 10 yards but came on strong in
the ﬁnal 110 yards to ‘set anew
meet record of 57.2. Later, she won
the hurdles ﬁnal in 6.4.

Two national high school girls

' indoor records were set at the Field

House. Trinity shot putter Karen
Sobansky’s‘throw of 47-8‘/2 broke
the meet and national record, while
William Penn High School’s
two-mile relay of Rose Richardson,
Pam " Hughes, Val Fisher and
Cynthia Kohlquit turned in a 9:23.5
clocking. Kohlquit also won the
open 880 in 2:16.7.

In all, seven meet records were
broken. William Penn’s two-mile
relay foursome also won the mile
relay in record time: 5:59'.1.

grabbing 16 rebounds and dishing
out nine assists.

Against Penn, Johnson was 9 of
10 from the floor and 11 of 12 from
the line for 29 points, hauled in 10

rebounds and distributed 10

assists. Michigan State is armed,
too, with‘ a superstar in forward
Greg Kelser, a master of the dunk
who also revealed a dependable
long-range jump shot and scored 28
against the out-manned Penn
Quakers.
, There seems to be no question
that Bird and Johnson are the two
greatest passers in the game.

“I am amazed by Larry Bird,”
said Spartan Coach Jud .Heathcote.
“But we still feel we have the best,

the most complete player in the
Magic Man.” i

The Magic~Man, an effervescent
personality in contrast to the
intense, sometimes moody Bird,
seems to disagree.

“I deﬁnitely think he is,” said
the 6-8 sophomore when asked who

"is the best player in the game.

“I’m a fan of Larry Bird. But
Monday night I just can’t_ get

Heathcote said the Spartans
would use the “matchup zone
defense” that carried them all year
while the Sycamores are expected
to concentrate on a man-to-man
defense.

Beaver Falls Candy Young sweeps ahead of the field.

“We hope we can keep Bird on
the outside, but they’re not a
one-man team,” said Heathcote.
“If you concentrate all your efforts
on Bird, then the rest of them are
going to go in for dunks and
layups.”

S Indiana State’s Bill Hodges, a
balding man who sometimes
squirms under the national spot-
light, admits he.can hardly believe
all that’s happened in this, a
fairytale season for a rookie head
coach.

“It’s almost like a dream being
here,” he said. “And he’s not
offended to be labeled the
underdog. Y

Men’s Volleyball Team Nets Fifth Victory over Weekend

By ANNA ARL0TTA_
, Pitt News Staff Writer
\ A The men’s volleyball team beat
the University of New York at
Albany last weekendin a tri-match
with Rochester University and

Albany.

The Panthers (5-19) have been
playing top-notch competition all
season in order to build the new
program, and according to coach
Mike Hebert, it is this strong
competition that will help improve
‘his team. ''

‘ ‘We’ve been playing well,” said
Hebert, ‘ ‘considering what sort R’ of
competition we are going up
We have scheduled the
toughest competition available to
us because we are involved in a
building program and playing
against weak teams isn’t going to
help us improve.”

’ Panther Jeff Beavers comment-
ed, “All ﬁrst-year teams have
trouble. Our biggest problem is
inexperience. Many of the players
hadn't played in high school. Right
now we are feeling our way around
and learning the ropes.”

In Rochester, the Panthers split a
match with Rochester, losing the
best out of ﬁve matches 3-1. The
Panthers lost the_,ﬁrst two games

ta---....r.-¢-. . ,....--

15-8 and 15-9, before winning the
third game 15-13. They then lost
the close fourth game, 15-13.

The second match of the day with
Albany was much more encourag-
ing. The Panthers won the ﬁrst two
games by scores of 15-8 and 15-13,
and then dropped the third game
15-4 before clinching the match
with a 15-2 score.

‘ ‘Since we are playing strong and
experienced teams, a win is a big
plus for us. _ A victory for us right
now adds more to the respect and
credibility of us as a team, ” Hebert
said. “I was pretty happy with the
performance this weekend. The
best was by starters Jeff Beavers
and Ricky Camacho who played a
very strong match. Also Brian
Devine and Mark Ochs played well
coming off the bench.”

After coaching Pitt’s women’s
volleyball team ‘to an Eastern
championship, Hebert is starting
over again. He was able to take the
women to the national ranks in only
three years of competition and this
new team’s looking forward to
doing the same.

“I remember one of the things
that coach Hebert told us at the
beginning of the season,” said
Beavers, “was that our goal was to
get to the nationals in three ’years

.ton,

just as his girls team did. That is
our goal for the future. Right now
we are in a learning experience.”
A home match with Rochester
University and Allegheny College

at Trees Hall on Saturday afternoon
remains. "From there the_ Panthers
ﬁnish their season with a contest at
George Mason University in
Fairfax, Virginia

“We are at a part of our season
where a few wins over teams that
are more our caliber will be good
for us,” said Hebert. ‘ “It is
important for us to ﬁnish strong.”

Pitt Nine to Face CMU Tornonow

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team, anxious to
open its season, meets Carnegie-
Mellon tomorrow in a double-

header on the Tartans’ ﬁeld.

The Panthers have had trouble
getting their season underway.
Last week’s game at West Virginia
was postponed-because of incle-
ment weather, while road trips to
Charlottesville, Va. and Washing-
D.C.. were cancelled for
ﬁnancial reasons.

Weather permitting, the Pan-
thers will face a Carnegie-Mellon
team they beat four times last
season.

“Carnegie-Mellon will be better
this season,” Pitt coach Bob Lewis
said. “Last year was the first time
they had a baseball team, so
things were new for" them.

..r ,,

“They’ve brought in some good
ballplayers, plus they have some
football players they couldn’t use
last fall who will play for them this
spring,” added Lewis, concluding
that the Tartans “will be. much-
improved.”

About his own team, Lewis said
“we’re coming along really well.”

“As the weather gets warmer,
our batting and pitching will get’
even better—especially our pitch-
ing,” the Panther coach said.
“When the weather’s cold, the
pitchers‘ really can’t get loosened
up.

“Fortunately, the weather’s
been super this past week, so
they’ve gotten a lot of work,”
Lewis said Wednesday of his
pitchers, .who threw about five
innings each in last week’s
intrasquad games.

BASEBALL NOTES: Starting for
Pitt tomorrow .will_ be Chuck
Mesiano, ﬁrst base; Duane Sakan-
ich, second base; Marc Massa,
shortstop; Chris Mihalik, third
base; Rich Kline, left ﬁeld; Mark
Stevens, center ﬁeld; Tony Roperti
or Rich Fenoglietto, right ﬁeld; and
Jim Pastin, catcher.

All, except Massa, return from
last season’s ll-17-1 team.

According to Lewis, the starting
pitchers will be chosen from a
group that includes returnees Tony

DiSaia, Marc Bianco, and Don
Koller.
Larry Lamonde, one of the

team’s top recruits, is recovering
from a broken jaw and probably
won’t pitch for another two weeks.

Pitt basketball player Darrell
Gissendanner is on Lewis’ team.
The freshman ‘from Clairton is an
inﬁelder.

Valley Wins

  A PIAA Crown

New Kensington’s Valley High
School, after finishing ﬁfth in the
Western Pennsylvania Interschol-
astic Athletic League (WPIAL)
Class AAA basketball playoffs,
held off Allentown’s Allen High
School Saturday night to win the
state championship.

The Vikings, behind Bill Var-
ner’sT 28 points and 11 rebounds
and Goose Pryor’s 22 points and 8
rebounds, saw a third-quarter
16-point lead dwindle to two, but
put the game out of reach in the

A ﬁnal minute, 72-66.

Earlier, Western representative
Franklin Regional became the first
WPIAL girls’ Class AAA team to
capture the state championship,
soundly defeating Lancaster Mc-
Kaskey, 68-42.‘ It marked the first
time in 11 ‘years the Eastern
representative had not won the title
game.

Franklin Regional’s Cheryl Elli-

‘ son paced the Pantherettes with 33

points and 17 rebounds, while
teammate Pam Miklasevich added
22 points and 13 caroms.

In Class A championship play
Saturday night, Pottsville St. Pius
X High School knocked off
Conemaugh Township for the state
crown, 57-52. St. Pius handed the
Winged Lions (30-1) their only loss
of the season. I . I

“This is like a dream,” said the
winners’ first-year coach, Tom
McGee. “It’s the dream of every
coach. I just don’t know what to do
for an encore—retire or some-

_ thing.”

York,Catholic kept the Eastern
girls A win-streak alive by
outlasting Johnsonburg High
School, 51-41. Johnsonburg, after
a four-month layoff (it plays a
fall-season schedule), returned to
the ﬁnals after losing in the
championship a year ago." York
(33-1) enjoyed a balanced offensive
attack, getting 12 points from Dana
Boyle and 11 a piece from Missy
Dearborn and Teresa Strausbaugh.

It’s Bird-Man Versus Magic-Man in Utah

By The Associated Press .

SALT LAKE CITY—-“How do I
feel about the matchup with Magic
Johnson?” Indiana State’s Larry
Bird repeated a question. . “I don’t
look at it as a matchup.

“I am a scorer. He is a passer. I
can’t guard him. He can’t guard
me. We are two different people.”

The towering spearhead of the
unbeaten No. 1-ranked Sycamores
spoke logical words but even he
could not dull the marquee impact
of the Indiana State-Michigan State
battle tonight for the NCAA college
basketball championship. '

No matter how one tries through
cold analysis to downplay the
_eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation of
the season’s‘ two top cage
personalities, the NCAA ﬁnal boils
down to a dramatic, super-charged
duel between two of the season’s
leading personalities.

It’s the “Bird Man” against the '

“Magic Man.”

Bird is correct when he says he
and his arch rival are different.
They are of different ' color,
different backgrounds, sharp
contrasts in style——both on the floor
and off.
