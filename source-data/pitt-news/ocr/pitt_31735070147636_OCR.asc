Students join gas drilling protest

Student Environment Coalition members among hundredswho marched Downtown yesterday morning

Andrew Bergman i
For The Pitt News

Pitt students joined hundreds
of demonstrators that gathered
Downtown yesterday to protest
Marcellus Shale drilling with mu-

sic, marching and speeches.

The protesters gathered at I V

Allegheny Landing on the North
Shore around 10:30 a.m., where
organizers distributed pamphlets,
banners and signs with slogans

. like “shut them down,” “gas holes
stink’? and “Ed Rendell will go to
A hell,” among others.

By 11 a.1m., the crowd began 4.

to grow substantially, and not
just with college-aged protest-
ers. Pittsburghers of many ages
and dispositions participated in
the protest and march, suggesting
how pervasive the issue of natural

gas drilling has become among -

Pennsylvanians.
The Pittsburgh Student En-
vironmental Coalition, a con-

glomerationiof student groups

fromlPitt, CIMU, Chatham and
Duquesne made up a consider-

’able portion of the crowd. V
Seth Bush, a representative

fromthe coalition, said that he
is-not only opposed to the “frack-
ing” process that has been so
widely publicized, but also that
“the water used for fracking is
treated with chemicals that are
carcinogenic.” .

He also voiced concern that.

Bio-plastics not P so eco—friendly after. all

Harmful chemicals used to grow plants used in;b;io~-pQ:liy.mers co_rLceri1:‘,»presearchers

Emily Riley
For The Pitt News

Researchers in Pitt-’s Civil and Environ-
mental Engineering department published
a study last month suggesting that bio-
polymer-based plastics might not be as
“green” as their name would suggest.

The discovery, however, is not a setback
for green industry and recycling methods,
researchers said, and should be viewed as
another step forward in the march toward
developing a sustainable and environmen-
tally friendly economy.

Kristen Ostermann —— a graduate stu-
dent in the Environmental Engineering
department who is familiar with the proj-
ect — said the reason bio—plastics can be
harmful involves the “un-green” practices
employed in growing the various plants
products used to produce them.

“These products are made with plants
grown with pesticides and harmful fertil-
izers which are frequently used in farming
today,” Ostermann said. “Unfortunately,
the majority of bio-polymer products are
produced under these circumstances.”

In the study, researchers claimed that

‘ although the biodegradability of bio-

polymer based plastics makes them more
eco—friendly than traditional plastics, the
production of the bio~polymer can be even
more detrimental to the environment than
traditional slow-to-degrade plastics.

. Bio-polymer products can be produced

Kristen Ostermarm:

Michaelangelo Tabone, a lead research-
er of the experiments, said the research
focused on comparing the environmental
impact of producing bio -polymers against
petroleum-based plastics. X

The research did not cover the impact
of the plastic products once they reach

-consumers’ hands or the impact of the

like sugars, starch, natural fats or oils,
according to Biopolymer.net.

.To establish these claims, the research
team examined 12 plastics. Seven were
petroleum-based, five were bio-p.olymer-

I based and one was a hybrid.

bone said. O

‘During their research, the team looked
at the plastics’ impact in 10 different po-
tential areas — acidiﬁcation, carcinogens,
ecotoxicity, eutrophication, global warm-
ing, non-carcinogens, ozone depletion,
respiratory effects, smog and fossil fuel

Flooding in
Benedumhalts
elevators    

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

A broken sprinkler might have caused the

_ ﬂood that halted elevators in Benedum

Hall.

At around 1:35 p.m., around 10 to 12
people milledaround the elevators on the
first ﬂoor of Benedum Hall.’ '

A group of men from Facilities Manage-
ment said around 1:40 that they were just
called in, but didn’t know what caused the
ﬂooding. '

A student said she heard the cause was
a broken sprinkler, but wasn’t sure.

Workers were sweeping water off
the stairwells. One of them said he»also
thought the cause was a broken sprinkler,

_ but wasn’t sure. He said the flooding might

have come from the 11th or 12th floor, and
that the source of the ﬂooding had already
been stopped.

Pitt spokesman john Fedele did not
know any details about the ﬂooding, but
said he’d find out. I C

Hundreds march on convention center

Protest 4 1

“water treatment facilities can’t
handle [water from fracking], and

so some of the chemicals end u ,

in rivers and streams.” -
Many environmentalists have
taken up Bush’s concerns in the
past weeks and months, organiz-
ing similar protest events and
campaigns.
Travis Windle, a spokesman for

‘ the Marcellus Shale Coalition said
after the event, “The ﬂuid used for__

hydrofracking is 99 percent water
and sand” and that “the additives
are similar to food additives, as
well as biocides for killing bacte-
ria.” He also said that these addi-
tives and other information about
drilling technologies are available
at the Pennsylvania,Department
of Environmental Protection’s
website and that “there is a trend
in misinformation about natural
gas production.”

Mel Packer, a local Green Party
aﬂiliate and one of the emcees
for the event, said that he was
thrilled_to see not only residents
from Pittsburgh, but people from
New York, Eastern Pennsylvania

and West Virginia at the event as
well. -

On the North Shore, the
gathered protesters listened to
speakers and musical groups,
which included Fox Club Forager,

a folk—punk act from Boston, and‘

The Raging Grannies, a trio of lo-
cal grandmothers who strongly
oppose shale drilling.

State Sen.]im Ferlo, D-Allegh-

eny, an opponent of shale drill— '

ing, gave one of the principle
speeches. I

“We need to heed our state
constitution, which says the peo-
ple have a right to clean air, pure
water and to the preservation of
the natural, scenic, historic and
aesthetic values of the environ-
ment,” Ferlo said.

“I took an oath as an elected
Senator to defend that c_onsti—
tution, and I’m going to ﬁght to
protect it,”,Ferlo said. , _

Around noon, the protesters
marched across the Rachel Carson
Bridge toward the David Lawrence
Convention Center,'wherethe De-
veloping Unconventional Fuels

Convention was taking place. For-
mer Deputy White House Chief
of Staff Karl Rove spoke at the
event.

On the way to the convention
center, some of 200 protesters at-
tempted to hang a banner from a

_ trafﬁc light post that read, “Burn

in Hell, Halliburton,” in reference

Jilll Ferlo:

ers and performers ranging from
Justin Sane of Anti-Flag to Pitts-
burgh City Councilman Doug
Shields.

Before playing a song, Sane, in
the anti- establishment rhetorical
style for which his band is known,
said that “the natural gas industry
can just wave money at politicians

We need to heed our ‘state

constitution . . . Pm going to

ﬁght to protect it. ;

to a corporation providing equip-
ment and services to the drilling
industry. Local police promptly
removed it. ‘

Aside from this incident, "the
protest was relatively peaceful,
and the police on the scene sel-
dom had to intervene.

At the convention center,_the
crowd heard from several speak-

and it makes it okay to harm the
environment.”
He also said “the industry

is not complying with the Clean H

Water Act.”

But, on Oct. 25,John Hanger,
the secretary of the Pennsylva-
nia Department of Environmental
Protection said, “We have not had
a single case of these [fracking]

' ﬂuids coming back to the ground-

water.” '

Windle said that “Hydrofrack-
ing is not new; its been in com-
mercial use since 1949, and it
has been used 1.1 million times
since then.” He also said, “[Hy-
drofracking] is one of the most
tightly regulated methods in the
industry.”

Shields, one of the most out-
spoken opponents of shale drill-
ing in Pittsburgh, said that he is
working to secure six necessary
votes in the Council to ensure a
veto proof affirmation of a drilling
ban in the city.

Shields said that “the ban is
going to engender a legal ﬁght,”
but that he hopes to send a mes-
sage to other cities as well as the
state legislature about banning
shale drilling. ‘ .

Pitt sociology professor Su-
san Staggenborg said that “these
movements can show that there is
a public opinion on the issue [of
gas drilling] ,” and that “this issue
is likely to get some support from
politicians.” I

Results positive for green
movement, researchers say

Plastics 4 2

In order for a plastic product to be con-
sidered green, according to Biopolymer.
net, it must be one or more of the follow-
ing — biodegradable, made from renew-
able ingredients or have environmentally
friendly processing. '

According to the Pitt study, bio—poly— -

mer plastics lack environmentally friendly
processing.

The products are currently used in dis-
posable dining utensils, water bottles,
plastic bags and numerous other products
typically made from plastic.

Dr. John Stolz ——~ the director for the
Center for Environmental Research and
Education at Duquesne — commented on
the fact that researchers‘ at Pitt were the
ﬁrst to publish such ﬁndings.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

“For any given product, the life cycle
is always considered, so this is certainly
not the first time that the impacts of pro-
cessing bio—polymers has been taken into
account,” Stolz said, ”I wish they would
do these comparisons for everything. And
Shale drilling while they are at it.”

Despite the evidence against the envi-
ronmental—friendliness of the bio —polymer
processing methods, all researchers in-
terviewed agreed that this should not be
viewed as a setback to the green move-
ment.

Stolz said these ﬁndings should not be
received negatively by the public.

“So often do we, in the scientiﬁc com-
munity, ﬁnd that our prepossessed be-
liefs have been false. These discoveries
are good! We need to ﬁnd a sustainable,
biodegradable product, but we need a bet-
ter way of processing,” hesaid.

The news of these findings, however,
encouraged negative sentiments among
Pitt students. ’ 7

Rebecca Schroeder -— a member of
the Pittsburgh Student Environmental
Coalition ——_ found the discoveries to be
disappointing.

“It makes me ‘sad, of course. It shows
that we, as an environmentally conscious
community, need to ﬁnd completely differ-
ent.alternatives —maybe we need to stop
using plastic all together,” she said. ﬂ

Whose hands should we allow in our Happy Meal?

Each year, we let the govemment’s
ﬁngers reach into our wallets, but

» should we also invite them into our

kids’ Happy Meals?
Whatever your views might be on
the limits of governmental interven-

tion, the municipal directors in San '

Francisco have granted themselves
this invitation anyway. And it’s not be-
cause theywantthe deep-ﬁied, greasy
goodness all to themselves. ’
Accordingto the Huffington Post,

on Tuesday the San Francisco Board of
Directors approved an ordinance that
would allowtoysto onlybe includedin

children’s fast food meals if the meals

meet strict nutritional criteria. If the
board members overturn the mayor’s
likely veto, toy—containing meals from
fast food restaurants would have to
limit excessive calories, sodium and
fat and also contain adequate portions
of fruits or vegetables.

In removing an incentive for chil-

dren to consume unhealthy food,
theboardismakinganefforttocurb
the alarming childhood obesity rate,
which the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention estimate to accountfor
17 percent of American children.

Whereas its impact isn’t limited to
the Happy Meal in San Francisco, the
ordinance has come under heavy ﬁre
by McDonald’s Corp. representatives.

- They argue that the board’s decision

not only threatens business but also
limits the parents’ ability to make deci-
sions fortheir children. Scott Rodrick,
who owns 10 McDonald’s franchises in
the Bay Area, said, “Somehow the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors just
took the happy out of Happy Meals.”

Law proposals that aimto affect
children’s behavior —- especially those
that limit it — never fail to unsettle

people. They conjure up the draconian
image of storm troopers invading a
nursery and rippinga sleeping, inno-
centbabe fromhis polka dot—studded
crib. '

But letting such fantasies get the
better of our rational discourse is
unwise. Although the San Francisco
board’s plan has ﬂaws, it represents a V
brave and creative effort by committed
public servants with limited means to
address a huge social problem. The
board members clearly approved the
ordinance with constituents’ inter-
ests in mind — though perhaps the

board could direct its concern more
pragrnaﬁcaﬂv

Instead of zeroing in on the prod-'

ucts of speciﬁc fast food companies
and thereby drawing political battle
lines, local municipalities like San
Francisco’s Board of Directors can
promote childhood obesity preven-
tion in other ways. Enhancing the
nutritional value of grade school
lunches, making in-school physical
exercise requirements more effec-
tive and involving parents in health
educational programs are all excellent

starting points. I

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN‘

You couldn’t

 
  
 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

In honor of The Pitt News’ 100th an-
niversary, we are turning our atten-
tion from pop culture and practical
advice to provide youwith the straight
dope aboutthe past. Most ofyou prob-
ably haven’t given the past too much
thought. If we asked you to describe
those good old days, you would doubt-
lessly respond, “Oh, that happened
back when, what with the Founding
Fathers, the moon landing, ‘talkie’ mo-
tion pictures and so forth.”

Well, friends, there’s a lot more to
the pastthanthe Founding Fathers and
the moon landing. For our purposes,
the past began with the discovery

‘ and settlement of America by people

from the nation of England. The Eng-
lish came to this great land to form a
more perfect union, which they did by
means of the Constitution.

The writing of the Constitution is

one of the most memorable events
thatoccurred inthe past. Several ofthe
biggest brains who ever lived decided
to pool their knowledge and write a
how-to guide for the country Their
guide wasn’t ever meantto bechanged,
althoughwe fallible human beings have
changed it, or “amended” it, a couple
of times. Did you. know that there is
nowanincometaxin'the'Const:itution?
'I‘hat’s crazy! You can bet your bottom
dollarthat ourFounding Fathers never

' wanted anyone to taxtheir slave plan-

tations and powdered-wig shops. . V
After the Constitution came some
of the famous wars. There were two
World Wars, but the second one was
more patriotic and has inspired many
gripping movies. Throughout these
wars, the nation demonstrated its tre-
mendous ability to achieve success.

Historians call this ability “manifest - ’
L destiny” and it is still with us today,

especially when it comes to winning

gold medals in track and ﬁeld events

at the Summer Olympic Games. .
After the last war ended, there fol-

lowed a lengthy golden period where
everythingwas copacetic. Ifyouwatch

thesitcomsofthattime,'youwilllearn .

that a majority of men had crew cuts

’ andallchildrengrewupinstable,two—

parent families where cracking gentle
wisecracks was a requirement.

This was when most of the ﬁn-
est athletes plied their craft. Well-
conditioned, physically imposing
specimens like Babe Ruth and Lou
“The Toe” Groza performed feats of
strength that today’s lazy, overpaid
players could never hope to equal.
Do you remember how sloppy, over-
weight Albert Haynesworth —- who
earns a cool billion a year playing for
the Redskins —— struggled to ﬁnish his
running test?

Things have gotten much worse
since the days of the past; Al Gore in-
vented the popular network that most
of us  the Internet — a tool that we
nowuse for procrastination, uploading
cool proﬁle photos, LOLcatting and
bullying. The weather has started to
get much hotter, with summer tem-

peratures soaringabovewater’sboiling
point and causing the extinction of vi-
talspecies suchasthe penguin, panda
bear, werewolfand gryphon.

Instead of toughing it out like Lou
“The Toe” Groza did during his 19
seasons in the NFL, people go on the
Oprah show and share their saddest
sob stories with the entire world. The
Constitution has become so riddled
with amendments that it’s almost
impossible to lock up a dangerous
child murderer or purchase an M80
rocket launcher. Almost everyone is
gettingsome form ofhandoutbecause
taxes are so high that nobody can pay
them. In a given day, the government
incurs nearly one trillion dollars in
new debt, mostly due to pork—barrel

_ spending. There is so much debt that

nobody knows how to pay it, and it’s a
shame thatthe FoundingFathers aren’t
around because they surelywould have
extricated us from this mess.

If you examine the past, you will
learn a lot about different lifestyles,
lifeways and ways of living. You will

live up to the past    you tried

also become disenchanted with our
subpar status quo. During our nation’s
salad days, its politicians and sports
stars exercised godlike powers. Re-
gardless of whether it was Paul Bu-
nyan’s lumberjacking or your home-
town Steelers’ “Steel Curtain” defense,
everything had reached its apogee long
before you were born. Nothing today

_can possibly be as good as it once was,

except perhaps for money.

Whereas The Pitt News has been
around for only 100 years of the past,
its many contributing writers have wit-
nessed the beginning of a period of
unimaginable declension and min. The
best we at The Moustache Column can
hopeforisthat most ofyouwilleVentu-
ally forget howwonderﬁrlthe pastwas,
a kind of forgetting that will be aided
byyour immersion irrtop-flight casual
games like Farmville, Yahoo! Sports
Fantasy Football and Maﬁa Wars.

The Future Ten festival has a surprise
for its audience each season, but one
year, the actors were surprised when
a woman went into labor outside the
venue. ‘

This year, with the hope that its
ownsurprises won’tbe overshadowed‘
again, Future Tenant will host its an—

nual Futiire Ten playfestival titled “Too
Bigto Fail.” ,

. Brad Stephenson, the festival’s
founder and co-producer, founded
Future Ten when he worked for Fu-
t11reTenant. ,

“I’ve always liked 10-minute plays,
and I like the short fomiat,” he said.
“You never know what’s coming

' Fred Betzner, co—producer of Fu-
ture Ten, also ﬁnds the short plays
inviting.

“It’s achal1enge,”Betzner said. “It’s
difficult to ﬁnd a complete character

The eightselected playwrights were
originally among 175 applicants, and
this year Future Tenant had the most

scripts everproducedforthefestiva1.A
panel of seven judges wentthroughthe
original plays and “wittled them down
to eight,” Stephenson said. The panel
was made up ofAndrew Paul, produc-
ingartistic directprfor Pittsburgh Irish
and Classical Theatre; Don DiGiulio,
founding artistic director of No Name
Players; Todd Betker and Adam Ku-
kic of Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre
Company and Laurazorch and Orvokki
Halme, directors of Future Tenant.

“Future Ten is a curated festival,
not a competition,” Stephenson said.
“They chose what is best for the audi-
ence.”

Both local and out—of-state play-
wrights submitted their work to the

A festival.

The festival is more of a communal
entitythathelps the playwrights, direc-
tors and actors to meet others within
their craft, Stephenson said.

Though the festival will give the
playwrights some publicity, it is not
the intention of the event.

“We’re not goingto make or break
aplaywright,” Stephenson said, laugh-
mg.

Each playwright has done plays in

the past, and some have had their work

in a Future Ten festival before. Play-
wrights such as E ]. Hartland, Arthur
M. Jolly, Joseph Lyons, Carol Mullen
and Gayle Pazerski have previously
been part of the show.

MOVIE COLUMN

Oft—quoted one—liners a

rarity in today’s cinema

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

While the box oﬁice rnightbe inﬁne spirits, lately
there’s been adilferent sort of recession plaguing
the movie industry: a lack of memorable quotes.

As Michael Cieply ofI'he NewYork'I'irnes not-
edinanoct. 19 ar1icle,fewerandfewer moviesare
producing lines that ﬁnd their way into everyday
conversation. True, there have been some excep-
tions — what teenager hasn’t quoted “Borat” or
“Mean Girls”? —— but you’d be hard pressed to
list ﬁve post-2000 ﬁlms capable of “Godfather”
or “Star Wars’ ’—1ike levels of citation.

This isn’t because screenwriting capabilities
have faltered — quite the contrary, in fact: Some
of the most talented screenwriters in history —

’ Aaronsorkin, QuentinTarantino,_]asonReit:rnan

— arealive andwell, churning out dialogue almost
sharperthan real life. Instead, I think, the blame

lieswithus.

You’ll notice that the two aforementioned ex-
ceptionstothisrule, “Borat” and“MeanGirls,”are
comedies. This is no coincidence: Young people
have become increasingly self-conscious, and to
state with sincerity something that might seem
cheesy or cliché is rapidly becoming a grave sin.
Because of this,the value of serious movies lines
is diminished. Instead, people are hungry, ﬁrst
and foremost, for absurdity.

Take, for example, the exception that proves
the rule: TommyW1seau’s “The Room.” Earlierthis
yearldevotedanentire columntothiszoosﬁlm,
which has remained entrenched in my memory
whereas other, more capableﬁlrns havefaded into
the ether. This is probably because ‘The Room”
is the worst movie I’ve ever seen; it lingers with a
viewerinthe samewaytraumas lingerwithpeople
longerthan happier moments. .

For that small minority of readers that don’t
religiously followmycolurnn, here’s abrieﬁnt:ro—
duction: ‘"1‘heRoom”isamelodramaaboutalove

Lisa and his best ﬁiend Mark.

The ﬁlm is oblivious to all ﬁlmic conventions
4 establishing shots, linear narrative, atime limit
for sex scenes — and is shot with two different
types of cameras, often against a greenscreen
backdrop. .

What makes “The Room” relevant to this
discussion is that it’s bad in away that’s uproari—
ously ﬁmny. Namely, therearetvvo aspects of this
movie that provoke uncontrollable laughter: the
aforementioned technical incompetence, and a

script so abysmal it’s almostas ifitwere originally '

writtenirradiiferentlanguage and then converted
into English by an online translator.

Here’s a few of “The Room’ ’ most famous
zingers: “I feel like I’m sitting on an atomic bomb
waitingforitto go off”; “I gotthe results ofthetest
back—— I deﬁnitely have breast cancer”; “Asfaras
I’m concerned, you candrop offthe Earth— that’s
apromise”; and most famously, “You are tearing
me apart, Lisa!” ’

In a more digniﬁed age, perhaps, these lines
would have never seen the light of day. In the nov-
elty-crazed 2000s, however, t:hey’re some of the
only bits of movie dialogue that still makes it into
conversation. You'Dube has gone a bit nuts with
users citing Wrsearfs Chernobyl of a script — just

best lines — and even celebrities like Patton Os-
walt and David Cross have paid the ﬁlm’s sound
bites homage. Furthermore, Idefy anyonetowatch

What does it mean that “The Room” is one
of the few remaining new ﬁlms to successﬁilly
inﬁltrate conversation? Simply that people have
growntiredofqualityﬁlmlines, andseekinstead
newways to be ironic, to have alaugh atsincere
movies’ expenses. .

Of course, the  frequency of new,

great lines is a comparatively small problem —.

greatﬁlms andgreatscreenplays are stillbeing

kids, we’ll have someone more wizened to quote

really see any difference as the artist but I know
that we’re the only band that’s ever had Columbia
and Decaydance do a joint venture, [so] it's like

Lipshaw believes his work with Decaydance
allows the band the advantage of learning from
Wentis established career. «

Future Tenis inits seventh season. Each festi-
val holds a surprise for the audience, and in past
years, there were games such as “Slap the Hooker,”
Stephenson said.

Much like an adult form of pir1—the-taﬂ—on—
the-donkey, participants had to slap the hookers,
which were both male and female.

“The game was not gender-speciﬁc,” he

joked.

This year, another“giant surprise” awaits the
audience. The two were hesitantindisclosing any
information, but did say it was unrelated to the
actual festival. . '

One important change in the festival is the
formatting of the performances. In the past, the
Future Ten festival showed 10 different plays,
which were split in half between the two week-
ends. This arrangement had audience members

feeling left out from the other weekend’s plays. '

This year, there are eight 10-minute plays

performed each night on both weekends, with

Betzner’s and Stephenson’s short introduction. '

There will not be any change between the two
weekends so the audiencewillhave thefullexperi-

,ence at both shows. ‘A

The new setupwill hopeﬁrlly spark attention,
Stephenson said, because now, the audience does
not need to invest in two separateweekends.

Panthers prepare for elite teams

Top Big East teams Louisville, Cincinnati set to play Pitt at Fitzgerald Field House this weekend

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

As the Pitt volleyball team returns
from a 1-2 road trip, the familiar
home setting of the Fitzgerald
Field House should be an advan-
tage as the Panthers look for a
successful weekend against the
Big East’s elite.

Based on the level of competi-
tion they will face, any such ad-
vantage will be welcome.

On Saturday, the Panthers will
take on Louisville, the second-
place team in the Big East Confer-
ence, then turn around the next
day to face the conference leader,
No. 21 Cincinnati on Sunday.

For head coach Toby Rens, the

fact that the Panthers will play
these strong opponents at home
is a relief. .

“We have been traveling for
the past three weekends,” Rens
said. “It takes atoll on the team
and it.will certainly be nice to
get some rest before our next

. matches.”

Those next matches will be
a test of the Panthers’ ability to
compete for a Big East tourna-
ment title, which both Rens and
his players consider to be up for
grabs.

“I believe the championship
can go to any of the teams that
make the tournament this year,”
senior setter Alyssa King said.
“The season competitionlevel

is highlthis year and there are no

easy matches.”

Rens echoed these sentiments,
noting the parity that exists in
the conference.

“Louisville and Cincinnati are
at the top of the conference, but
Louisville’s only loss has been to
Seton Hall, a team that we beat,”
he said.

The Cardinals fell to Seton '

Hall 2-3 in late September,
whereas the Panthers earned a
3-2 victory over the Pirates one
week later.

Cincinnati also has one loss in
the season at the hands of Lou-
isville, adding to the notion that
the Big East standings are not
immovable.

The Panthers are currently H

in seventh place in the 15-team

short at BigEast Championships

As the teams prepare for NCAA Regional Championships, the men’s team ﬁnishes 12th and the women finish 15th

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt cross country teams need-
ed everything to go right in order
to have a shot at placing high at
the Big East Championships last
weekend.

But the elements of the race
didn’t add up to afavorable outcome
for the men’s and women’s teams in
Jamesville, N.Y., on Saturday.

h“The Big East Championship
was the most difﬁcult race of the
season so far,” senior Josh Chris-
topher said. “Not only because of
the quality of competition, but be-
cause of the [muddy] conditions
and the course. It was a hilly course,
so when you combine the two to-
gether, we didn’t get solid results
as a team.” . -

_ The men came in 12th place out
of 14 teams, and the women ﬁnished
15th out of 16 teams. The women

competed first in-a 6K race, fol-

lowed by the men, who ran an 8K.
Syracuse picked up its sec-
ond consecutive Big East title on
the men’s side, and the Villanova
Women won their third consecu-
tive title. - , L
Christopher led Pitt’s men’s
team for the second consecutive
race, followed by Teddy Miller,
Vinnie DePalma, Kevin Hull and
Andrew Cerrito. Christopher ﬁn-
ished‘ in 55th place overall with a
time of 27:16.1. '

. “Iran as hard as I could at [the '
‘ championships], which is the most

important thing for myself,” hesaid.
“But I know that I’m capable of run-
ning much better.” « V

“I knew we would have to; run ’

above our ability in order to beat
more teams in such a competitive

' conference,” Miller said. “Unfor-
tunately, we did not step up on Sat— *

urday. Most of the team ran on par

with how they did all season? ‘
‘Freshman Susannah Feinstein

led the women again, and ﬁnished

with a ﬁnal time of 24:12.8. Filling
out the remaining top ﬁve slots for
the women were Emily Barno, Miya
Johnson, Stephanie Powers and Ele-
sia Wilson.

. “Right now, I’m just looking for-
ward to our next race because it’s

the Regional Championships. It’s _

a longer race (10K instead of 8K)
which suits my racing style better,
and it’s the single most important
race of the season,” Christopher
said.

“Personally, I did not do as well
as I wanted to. I had a disappointing
race. Normally, I rtmwell on courses

which are hilly and muddy,” Miller -

said. -“I have one more important

race left, and nothing to lose, so you V

can expect a much different race in
two weeks.’.’. V

Both the‘ men’s and.women’s

teams have the next week off, and

tion for the>Mid—Atlantic Regional

GREGORIAN RANTS

Trietley presents his All-
Underrated baseball team

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

 

You’ve probably never heard of Artie Wil-
son.

He’s one of those people that you don’t
learn about until he passes away. I hadn’t heard
of him until I read his obituary Tuesday after-
noon. He died Sunday at the age of 90.

Wilson was the last baseball player to hit‘

.400 in a professional league, hitting .402 in

That’s pretty cool, but here’s where it turns
into a Hollywood ﬁlm. In 1877, the owner of
the Grays received an anonymous telegram
that said, simply, “Watch your men,” accord-
ing to “The Louisville Grays Scandal of 1877”
by William Cook.

After all sorts of twists —- including re-
porter/son-oflteam-president/second base-
man John Haldeman accusing teammates of
throwing games —— Devlin confessed to just
that. He and three other players received a

. lifetime ban.

The Grays folded, a ring of New York gam-

After reading up on a few of the past’s forgotten

1948 with the Birmingham Black Barons of
the Negro Leagues.

That year, he also mentored a 16-year-old
Willie Mays. If it weren’t for baseball’s color
line, Wilson, as his obituary stated, could have
been an All—Star in- the majors.

For every mythic baseball legend —- did
your middle school social studies textbook
mention Babe Ruth like mine did? —- there
is an outstanding player like Wilson whom
history overlooked. After reading up on a few
of the past’s forgotten_stars, it’s time to give
credit where it is due and put together an all-

‘ underrated baseball team that would crush

the Yankees and make the Giants look like
amateurs.

Jim Devlin starts on the mound. The 1919
Black Sox Scandal led to “Shoeless” Joe Jack-
son’s banishment from baseball, at big hul-
laballoo and a Charlie Sheen movie. The 1877
Louisville Grays scandal, though, gets noth-
1ng.

According to Baseball Almanac, Devlin
stands third all-time with a career 1.89 ERA.

  stars, it’s time to give credit where credit’s due.

blers were exposed and Devlin died six years
later of tuberculosis. At the time of his death,
the scandal must have overshadowed what a
great, albeit punctuated, career he had. He
pitched 622 innings in 1876. He started — and
ﬁnished —— every day for his team.

Catching him is_]osh Gibson, who brings a
Pittsburgh ﬂavor to the squad. Gibson, like Dev-
lin, died young, and he, like Wilson, excelled in
the Negro Leagues. His Baseball Hall of Fame
plaque states he hit “almost 800” homers in a
career that included stops in Homestead and
the Hill District in the 1930s. It’s impossible
to tally an exact number, but “almost 800”
sounds good enough for my team.

1 At ﬁrst base is Sadaharu Oh, who also bats

_ cleanup. He holds the world record when he
hit 868 career home runs injapan. Once again, ‘

history forgets Oh because he played in a time
before the majors were international.

_ Across the diamond at third base is Frank
Baker. “Home Run” Baker led the American
League in dingers for four straight years,
from 1911 to 1914. Soon after, that mythic

conference with a 5-5 Big East record, but
with ﬁve other teams nearby in conference
record, Rens understands that a tourna-
ment berth is still a possibility.

“With the waythe Big East standings
are right now, picking up a few key wins
this weekend will really improve our situ-
ati_ori,” Rens said. .

In order to accomplish that task, the

Town often receives attention for her
offensive kill ﬁgures, but Rens is quick to
point out her importance in the defensive
game plan.

“Amy is a strong hitter and~that..is most
visible,” he said. “Yet, she frequently is
one of the dig leaders on the team for a
given match.” -

Each week, we try to work on overall team aspects
of our game, specifically blocking form and serving

accuracy.

Panthers must find a way to deal with the
high-powered offenses of both the Cardi-
nals and the Bearcats.

Louisville is led by outside hitter-Lola
Arslanbekova whereas Cincinnati looks
to the Big East Player of the Week, out-

side hitter Stephanie Niemer for offensive .

V Although these teams will bring a strong .

attack, the Panthers have consistently

‘showed outstanding defensive efforts, led ‘

by sophomore libero Margy Acton and
senior outside hitter Amy Town. , _
“Margy has been playing very well for

_us,” Rens said of his l-ibero, who recently
set the school record for most digs in a

game, with 45. “She brings great energy

In fact, Town has recorded seven dou-

- ble—double performances this season by

collecting double-digit ﬁgures in both
kills and digs. ‘

The preparation plan for the Panthers
this week will consist of analyzing the
game systems of Louisville and Cincinnati
while working on their own team goals.

“Each week, we try to work on over-

‘all team aspects of our game, specifically
blocking formiand serving accuracy,” King

said. “These team goals help us focus on
the upcoming matches.”

Focus, combined with a superior level
of play, will be key in the Panthers’ search
for wins against the reigning elite in what

converted-pitcher Ruth stole the spotlight,
and not too many folks wax poetic about Baker
these days. .

But enough of the power: Johnny Ever
plays second base. Weighing 125 pounds, ac-
cording to Baseball Almanac, Evers was the
feisty 1900s version of Dustin Pedroia. He and
Joe Tinker were the Cubs’ double—play duo for
10 years, but on my team he ﬂips it to Wilson,
who played shortstop when he hit .402 with
the Black Barons.

Bob Johnson starts in left ﬁeld. “Johnson

never had one of those super seasons that
make everyone sit up and whistle,” sports
writer Bob Carroll once wrote. “While phe-
noms came, collected their MVP trophies, and
faded, he just kept plodding along hitting .300,
with a couple dozen homers and a hundred
ribbies year after year  like a guy punching
a time clock.”

He drove in 100 runs eight times, hit 20 or '

more homers nine straight times and hit .300
ﬁve times — and was a great ﬁelder. He did
most of it with the Philadelphia Athletics inthe

1930s and 19405, but now he’s on my team.
Bobby Bonds roams center ﬁeld. People

recognize him as the father of Barry Bonds, but

he had a Hall of Fame-worthy career himself

in the 19705. With speed on the bases, power ,

at the plate and three Gold Gloves, he deﬁnes
“ﬁve—tool player.”

Filling out the roster is right ﬁelder Sam
Crawford. “Wahoo Sam” holds unbreakable
records for career triples (309) and single—sea—
son inside-the-park homeruns (12), a vestige

of the bygone small-ball era of baseball.

When Lawrence Ritter set out in 1964 to
interview Crawford for what would become
the book “The ,Glory of Their Times,” Craw-
ford’s wife wouldn’t say where he lived beyond
“somewhere between 175 and 225 miles” north
of Los Angeles, as Ritter recalled in the preface
of the book. ’

So he drove around, asking about Crawford
until he ended up in a laundromat in Baywood
Park, Calif., in order to get some laundry done.
He sat down next to a “tall, elderly gentleman
reading a frayed paperback” and asked him if
he’d heard of that old tiger named Crawford.

“Well, I should certainly hope so,” the man ‘

said, “bein’ as I’m him.”

My players might be overlooked, and you
might not recognize their faces, but, man,
