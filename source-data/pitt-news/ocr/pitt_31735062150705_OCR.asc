‘Last   Meeting  anee
By SFA as Group F ails

To Maintain
Assembly Loses
 Chance for Final
3 Vote on Proposal

 For the third consecutive year
the ﬁnal meeting of the Student
‘Faculty association was can-

celled because enough members
were not'pr'esent to constitute a
quorum. '

Scheduled for 7:45 o’clock last
Wednesday, the meeting was oili-
cially called oﬁ at 8:30 o’clock by
Joseph Roberts, BA41, president,
when only 15 of the 40 members
had arrived.

Representing the faculty were
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, Miss Mary McKenna, instruc-
tor in English and Roy H. Umble,
instructor in English.

Members Present

Student members present were
Roberts, William Litel, D44; Hil-
lard Kreimer, BA42; Dave Tucker,
C41; Hiram Milton, C42;- ‘Harriet
Harris, Ed42;- Charlotte Harris,
C42; Edward Tait, BA42; Suzanne
Rigby, C42; Julia DeLeo, C42; Jack
Brady, C42, and Ben Foote,» C42.

Of this number 7 were members
of the fraternity group and ﬁve
of the independent group.

On the agenda for the meeting
were the usual committee reports
and the ﬁnal vote on the “ﬁll-in"
amendment which was returned to
the constitutional revision commit-
tee after a favorable voteat last
month’s assembly.

This amendment would elimniate
the necessity of proposing candi-
dates for SFA positions in addi-
tion to those who had turned in
petitions. Present rules call for the
pla_ceme_nt on the voting machines
of 60 names for the 36) SFA posi-
tions. ‘S '

Past Practice

Campus politicians observe that

during past years it has been the
practice of both political groups to
nominate additional candidates
from the oppositions party in or-
der to reach the required number
of 60 nominees and to split the po-
tential vote of the fraternity or
independent group. ,
' "Using this method the group
having the fewest nominations for
each position would have a better
opportunity of electing the. larger
number of members as the slate
votes would be divided among few-
er candidates.

Teagarden Describes Potential

.Evidently unimpressed by po-

tential quiz kids after 26 years of

teaching psychology at the Univer-

'sity, Dr. Florence Teagarden, pro-

fessor of psychology, just shrugged

‘her shoulders and described the 125

contestants for a position on the
popular juvenile quiz program as
“n__othing unusual.”

And Dr. Teagarden should know,
for she was one of seven judges
who helped in the selection of the
final winner.

‘-Together with Dr. Anthony Gold-
berger, professor of education, Dr.
Ben G. Graham, ’25, superintendent
of- the Pittsburgh schools, and
others from Tech and PCW, Dr.
Teagarden listened as over 100
youngsters from 8 to 15 years of
age answered questions ranging
from sports to Egyptian dynasties.

The contest is nation-wide, with
similar eliminations taking place
in large cities throughout the coun-
try. Focal point of the contest was

Oﬁered to Students
Beginning Monday

Faculty Members, Campus Leaders,
Endorse Campaign as ‘Educational’

Repeating the View that the value of the Wassermann blood
tests lies in its educational advantage to the individual concerned,
faculty members and several campus leaders gave their endorsement

to the campaign which opens next Monday.

The campaign  spon-

sored by the Pitt News, the Men and VVoznen’s Health services, and
the Pittsburgh Syphilis Control board.

Joseph Roberts, BA41. president of the Student-Faculty asso-
ciation, Gene Tedick, C41, president of the College association,
Mary Ruth Hosey, C41, president of Women’s Self Government associa-
tion, and Jean Brink, ‘C42, president-elect of WSGA, issued a blanket
statement of their complete approval of the campaign. and urged it as a
oppo.rt'unity not to be missed by any University student.

Miss Helen Pool Rush, assistant to the dean of women, declared that
taking the'Wassermann blood test was part of a broad social program of
which this particular phase is only a small but important unit, ‘all of

which is leading to general health.
Miss Rush added that she was very
much in favor of the plan and would
like to see more campaigns of the
same type on campus.

The tests will be available to all
University students, faculty mem-

bers, and employees, beginning
Monday at 7 o’clock and la.st'ing
until Friday  5 o’clock in the

Men's Health service on the thirty-
fourth floor, and the Women’s
Health service on the twentyi-eighth
ﬂoor. Tests are free and all re-
ports are conﬁdental.

“An annual blood test for every-
one s'hou.ld be as much a part of

' the routine of living as going to the

dentist." states Dr, Millard C. Han-
the Pittsburgh

’ sponsors of the campaign. “Early
syphilis is painless.” Dr. Hanson
_ stated. “Hence many persons who

have been stricken do not even sus-
pect it.” Syphilis  be trans-
mitted in such a simple way as a
handshake, and blood tests are the
only sure way to ﬁnd this disease.

The first campaign was spoméored
four years ago by the Pitt News
and during the first week over 600
students were blood tested. Almost
2,500 students were blood tested
during the entire time. This year
the goal is to b-etter that amount.

Simze all reports are conﬁdential
and no percentage figures are avail-
able only  fact may be revealed
ab.o=;.t  re.*_1_it;s of the tests. Not
one deﬁnitely positive case has
been reported in the four years tests
1:-zve been made.

The method of blood testing is
very simple, and painless, the main
work comes after the blood is taken
from the arm. The blood is analy-
zed and tested for positive or nega-
tive reaction, positive reaction in-
dicating syphilis. The laboratory
work is being done by the City-
County laboratories, and results are
returned to the health services
where individual reports are made.

of Pitt Town Meeting, had origin-'

ally planned to present Dr. A. M.

Fine Arts Gallery Exhibits
Works of Modernist Artist

One of the first artists of Amer-
ica to develop an interest in the
mathematical principles of com-
position was E. Ambrose Webster,
whose paintings are now on exhibit
in the ﬁne arts gallery.

Webster was essentially a mod-
ernist. His 18 paintings now on
exhibit, including “Monterey,”
“California,” and “Banana,” show
the inﬂuence of the impressionistic
and modernistic periods, and are
simple in design and strong in con-
struction. Although they may seem
a bit unusual they are thoroughly
intelligible to many awe stricken
observers.

Believing that nature was not art
and that the artist must create new
forms in order to harmonize all
the part of his composition, Web-
ster used a high palette and dealt
largely in blues, purples and pinks.

By the intricate use of geometric
patterns and vivid colors he gives
the impression of intense sunlight
reflected from rooftops. Upon ob-
servation one sees the blinding
splendor of sunlight and is made
aware of the weather and temper-
ature through light and color that
have not a word to say of pigiment
or method.

Ambrose Webster was a Pro-
vincetown painter, born in 1369 in
Chelsea Mass, and was director at
the Webster Art school in Province-
l0W'1l. Having s.udied in Paris with
Gleizes, he returned to continue
his pioneering in America.

This exhibition of paintings by
E. Ambrose Webster. was loaned to
the University by his Widow. The
Show will extend from April 14 to
May 3.—Anita Pat Barone.

A Plea f0l' An Honest
Prediction of Events

OPTIMISM CAN be a horrible thing. We’re
learning that for the third time, as we watch
the Allied efforts to hold their Grecian bridge-
head to Europe.

Before the present Balkan battle began, we
read that the tough Yugoslavs, aided by terrain,
would hold back the Germans, and cancel the
Italy in Albania issue. We read that the tough
Greeks would hold the Germans, mechanized or
no, and that the British, veterans of Libya,
would hurl the Germans across the Danube.
Just as a year ago we read the opening of the
Norway front would see the Germans evicted
from Scandinavia and that the opening of the
Western Front would throw the Germans out
of Europe.

In other words, our newspaper and radio
columnist-predictors have at all times under-
estimated the Germans and over-estimated the
Allies. These forecasters, upon whom we are
forced to rely, have failed to learn from experi-
ence.

For a year now, before every new battle and
after every new defeat, we have been given the
most optimistic predictions and glossed-over
analysis possible. The result of the latest press-
sponsored. optimism is the deep wave of pessim-
ism that is sweeping this country.

We don’t l.ike to second guess, but at the risk
of being thought curbstone coaches, we think
a more realistic view of the various campaigns
could have been taken by our experts on for-
eign affairs. For example, it shoul.d have been
apparent that the opening of a new front at this
moment would benefit the Germans, strong i.n
manpower, and hinder Britain by causing a dis-
persal of her much needed men. and material.
The Polish, Norwegian, and Flanders campaigns
should. have hinted that terrain is not as mu.ch
an obstacle as some people would like to believe.

The trend of the land warfare in this war did
not justify the rosy glow that emanated from
the nation’s press on the eve of the Balkan cam-
paign. Far better for the morale of the country
would have been a realistic portrayal of condi-
tions in Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Near East.
Then the nation, while rooting for an Allied vic-
tory, would not have had i.ts press-sponsored
hopes dashed from"f*“i_npenetrable” Olympian
heights.   i

What we’re asking is that our admirals and
generals of the press give us predictions based
on facts rather than on wishful. fancies. Like
the British public, who are asking for the true
picture, we want a true appraisal, even if it
hurts. And that goes for the chances of Russia
turning on Germany as well as for the possibili-
ties of our entrance.

The Spring Panacea:
‘lleacl (Iver Heels’

SUREST SIGN of spring next to weather re-
ports, leaves on trees, ﬁlmy dresses, and tet‘e--a-
tetes on the lawn is Cap and Gown, the Univer-
sity’s deep and awkward bow to things farcical.

The show starts on Monday. This is just a
gentle reminder to the blase senior and unini.ti—
ated freshman to get his ticket for the show,
see ‘it one or m.ore times, and throw away his
mod.ern equivalent of sulphur an.d molasses.

Press agents for “Head Over Heels” guaran-
tee that the show will cure you of any i.l.1nesses.
That may be far, fetched, bu.t We’re su.re that it
will cure you of any ideas of the sacredness of
the drama. This is not a slam, for a C&G show
without muffed lines, missing cues, and chorus
missteps is a flop.

So, see you Monday night, first floor left cen-
ter, you bring the peanuts.

WE LEARN with considerable displeasure
that the circulation of the Pitt News has been

enough t.o provide a partition between the grass
and your pants,/skirt.

Disregarding this, however, we ask that you
keep the Pitt News oil the grass. Neither in
color, texture, or form does it supplement the
motif of the landscaping.

[This is installment number two of “Leaves
From My Family T7ee.”]

Besides the state pen and grave-yards at night, we
were almost afraid of something else. The edge of
town nearest our place \was called Boom Town, be-
cause there had once been a boom i.n coal there, and
the toughest little kids that ever chewed tobacco at
three and cut throats at twelve dwelt therein. They
were our sworn enemies, and we waged incessant and
sometimes bloody warfare with them. One of our
favorite reactions was to swipe corn from their back-
yard patches and have a real old-fashioned corn-roast.
This was wicked, since they depended on these patches
for a considerable portion of their subsistence, and
their retaliations partook of the awful. ‘

Most of them worked as caddies on the golf course
that lay on the other side of our place, and here too
we clashed. There was a woods alongside the course,
and we used it as an ambush for dub golfers. When
a ball fell near the edge of the woods we would swoop
down on it, snatch it up, and disappear into the forest
primeval. The golfers, of course, always took it out
on the caddies, and the end result was that the latter
took to patrolling the links in an old Ford used to pull
a lawn-mower. When we were caught, which was
infrequently, we were beaten up and thrown in “the
dam,” a pond formed by the damming of a creek that
ran through the course, to form a water--hazard.

Defense Programs Even Then.

This was strong-arm stuff, and our answer to it was
to build a tree house in a huge beech tree right on
the edge of the course. We lined the house with thick
carpet in which we cut loop holes, and stocked it with
B-B guns and food. We weren't allowed. to use the
rope ladder for which our souls yearned, our parents
considered such too dangerous, but nobody ever got
close enough to the tree to climb the permanent wooden
one, if we didn’t want him to.

One day, however, our enemies showed up with
riﬂes, and shortly thereafter the tree--house came
down, with jail sentences being narrowly averted. I
still bear scars from that encounter.

We were not to be driven away from the manifest
attractions of the golf course, though. How cou.ld any
boy be expected to stay away from the froggy creek,
or the sand trap in which black widow spiders bred?
I took home one of those black widows once, and it
promptly laid eggs which hatched out about a million
inﬁnitesimal baby spiders each. T'hose wee black
widows-to-be crawled out the airholes punched in
the top of their bottle and spread all over the house,
but no one was ever bitten, so I guess it was all right.

We had to get dressed every evening for dinner,
and as a result the crepuscular hours always had a
barren. feel. We didn’t dare climb trees, wrestle, or
explore thickets. so we sat around uncomforta'bly in
our clean clothes, smelling of soap, and gradually get-
ting sleepy enough to go to bed.

A Long-t:i;me View

Of the Draft Problem

0 By EDGAR BEIGEL

F. D. Roosevelt has made it known that, unless he
is influenced to the contrary, there is a good chance
the draft age will be lowered to include boys 18 years
or older.

The President told correspondents that a years
training in the service of his country would do any
boy good, that he wished he could have had the op-
portunity back in the ’90s.

We are in complete agreement with this proposal
by the President, a project which seems to be a splendid
expansion of the CCC concept of the early years of the
New Deal.

A year or two of national service we believe would
go a long way towards developing a feeling and spirit
of national consciousness, as well as doing little harm
to undeveloped. muscular coordination.

It is the time element, however, that forces us to
part ways with the President. Time, and the rather
subtle question of motive. As conceived by the general
staff this 18-year draft age would become effective
within six months.

As we, in all seriousness, conceive the problem, the
year of national service would probably begin one year
after the present war ends. *

Remembering the P:'esident’s great respect for the
philosophy of William James and the President’s con-
ception of the CCC work camps, we do not believe the
resident of his own volition desires this row na-
tional service for military purposes. We wish he would
state that attitu.de publicly.

Our argument for the post-armistice training period
to one of absorbing part of the working population as
a means of assisting in the prevention of a post-war
overabundance of labor, deﬂation in production, and
all of the economic ills of the 1920 motif.

Unfortunately the motivating forces behind the Gen»
eral Staff have never been known to dilly-dally in
economic theory, and we believe they have more of an
eye on the arsenal than on the production charts when
they suggest that boys down to 18 should serve their
country.

For those of you who say, “What’s the matter with
drafting these kids today?” we have two reasons:

(1) Sixteen million three hundred seventeen
thousand men registered last October. Eight hundred
thousand of these will be in service this July and the
same number more every July for the next ﬁve years,
a grand total of 4,000,000 men. The cost of conscrip-
tion this 'ear alone is $1,600,000,000. The full program
will cost somewhere around 10 billion dollars. With
trouble enough in organization and construction, we
suggest, for the purposes of econoiny where possible,
that training be continued with these boys 18-21 after
the war. when they can occupy barracks now being
used for Army trainees.

(2) In 1917-18 24,234,000 men registered in the
three drafts; 11 per cent of these men——2.'783,000 were
drafted into the Army. The tots’ number of American
troops engaged in the World ‘War was 4,057,000. in
July, 19-31 the American. army vii}? include 1,400,000

. . . and Contents Noted

Editor, the Pitt News:

‘There are many in America
whose sense of honor and doub'.e
sense cf self interest have left them
in considerable perplexity as to
what foreign policy our country
should adopt. Some of our
prophets will have us irrevocably
devoted to a British victory, with
or without troops . . More mod-
erate diagnosticians of our political
ills take a semi-all-out position, ad-
vocating somewhat cynically, and
in a business like fashion, the use
of the British Empire as a sort of
paid-for platoon, a bought-up bul-
wark against our potential enemies.

The third group, of course, is
composed of the inveterate quoters
of Washington’s farewell address,
sundry bits of other advices by
American greats, and the numerous
shady chapters of English foreign
policy. These clever individuals
. . . advise America to retire be-
hind a wall of adequately thick
armor and thumb its nose at the
rest of the world . . .

Tlee decision we make will be a
weighty one that may well be our
last as a free choosing nation.

The writer’s views are
bound up with those of the second
group, namely, the hard-shelled
Yankee type who demand a com-
mon sense, practical outlook on the
whole affair. He recognizes in Hit-
Ier’s Germany a potential threat to
the economic and perhaps military
well-being of the United States;
he wishes to eradicate that threat
at the least possible cost . . and
he believes that the English peo-
ple, admirably situated and still
virile enough to back-stab the Hit-
ler danger, should be maintained at
any price that remains material.

The above policy is admittedly
cold blooded. It regards the British
as potential laborers, wage-earners,
rnere hirelings bought for a fee to
do a specific task. It is subject
to the charge that the Lives of peo-
ple are being considered in the
same sense as cattle, hogs, or simil-
ar livestock. It is also subject to the
ch-arge~ that honorable Americans
would never accept such a pro-
gram, that the history of the world
cannot match such an act for sheer
materialism.

In answer, the writer protests
that nations of people have often
been evaluated and used as so many
head of livestock; that states, of
at least as much honor as America
can boast, have pursued such pol-
icies  the past; and that the
history of the world has often
matched. such acts, not the least
guilty . being the aforemen-
tioned British. is there any stu-
dent of American. history who does
not remember the I-lessiansi‘ These
soldiers, German youths who were
bought and paid for These
individuals were forced to pursue a
role little different from that we
would have the British follow . . .

another’s. Indeed, it has become a
byword in Anglo—French relations
to speak 0. “England ﬁghting to the
last Frenchman.” Gold sovereigns

. . have found their way into the
pocket of many a foreign schemer.
Governments have been won, lost,
and won again on the credit of the
accessible Bank of England. Even
today one may wonder
whether Churchi;l may not be wil-
ling to pledge the security of the
Empire on the willing backs of
Greeks, Yugoslavs, and (God for-
bid!) Americans.

Yes, the American patriot with
the Yankee soul can repeat, and re-
peat often, that he will sponsor no
program but one that calls for the
use of English ;aborers in the hand-
ling of our foreign threat; that
the labor laws to be agreed to shall
follow those lines of policy set
down by a similar-y minded Eng-
land in many past instances . .

He will add that . . his labor
policies shall be those accepted by
a Weir or a Girdler; that is, the
credit of the entire organization
shall not be bankrupted for the
we-l-being of a common laborer. In
this business, as in any other legal
undertaking, the return to the
stockholder shall be of prime im-
portance.

All this will place the author and
his set in a very mercenary light.
Let the reader be paciﬁed, however,
with the assurance that our force
of emp.oyees shall be well reward-

University Athletic Teams Face Heavy Week-En

Trackers Defend Dual

Meet Record Tomorrow

. By BEN room

After a fairly succe.-:.~;inl indoor campaign, head t.ra—.3k coach
Carl Olson unveils his 1941 outdoor cinder squad on the Pitt stadium
oval tomorrow aftei-noon  1:30, when his star-studded aggregation
matches strides and distances with a revitalized Ohio State troupe.

Fifteen successive times since midseason in 1937. Pitt Il'a(‘.l§
teams have stepped on the cinders for dual meet competition. and
each time they’ve walked oﬁ with a victory. Eight times through the
seasons of 1939 and 1940 the News prognosticator has predicted these
Panther wins.

Despite the ominous iorebodings created by publicity blurbs ircm
the Ohio State publicity department in proclaiming their talent to track
partisans, the crystal ball shows the Blue and Gold thinclads winning its
sixteenth consecutive engagement and the News scoring its ninth straight
correct forecast. The score will be close-—about 68-63.

Last season, a Pitt team that went
on to win the outdoor ICAAAA ti-
tle defeated the Buckeyes, 73-58;
consequently the Columbus outﬁt
will be ﬁghting to avenge last year’s
defeat.

As was the case most 01 the in-
door season, Bullet Bill Carter and
T.-lap Stickel, the ﬂying junior stars
will be counted on to lead the scor-

ing. They will ﬁght between them-
selves for first in placing one-two
in both the 100 and 220.

Stickel should also win the low
hurdles from sophomore Bo-b
Wright, who tied Fred Wolcott"s
65-yard high hurdle title this win-
ter. Carter is favored to capture
the broad jump.

Dark--haired Del Anderson may
turn out to be Olson’s i'air-haired
boy, paradoxical as it may seem.
The lanky senior middle distance
ace ran a 50.5 second 4.40-yard stint
“taking it easy” Wednesday night.
I-le’s also been running some top-
notch half--miles, and Saturday he
should do no worse than a first and
a second.

Regis Larkin may also add a
point to the Panther total in the
quarter. I-l'e’s the only quarter-
rniler in top--notch condition aside
from Anderson. Tregoning hasn’t
fully recovered from his winter ac-
cident and will stay out oi the 44-0
to compete in the 100 and 220 for
Penn Relays conditioning.

A.nderson’s chief competition is
expected. in the half-mile from
Captain Les Eisenhart, the Scarlet
and G-ray’s m.iddle-distan'ce~ star.
Eiserl-hart will triumph. in the mile
first, and the fact that he’ll be tired
may work against him.

Senior Zeke Sterner seeks a new
Stadium record in the two--mile~
running against State’s Kiracoie.

Joe Newman figures to place sec-

aforementioned
120-yard high

th e
the

ond behind
Wright in
hurdles.

The ﬁeld events seem to be equal-
ly divided. Sophomore Bob John-
son, a 160-foot discus thrower and
48--foot shot putter is likely to score
two ﬁrstts for the Buckeyes. Ted
Konetsky in the discus and Bill
Benghauser in the shot are capa-
ble oi’ scoring upsets, however, a.nd
one of the two may come through
with a winning toss.

The pole vault may find a new
Stadium and University record go-
ing on the books. Pitt’s star duo,
Dusty Rhoades and Red Jessup
soared. to 13 feet 8 inches in whip-
ping State’s George Stimmel at the
Butler relays, but they may have to
go to 14 feet to win Saturday. The
Pitt outdoor record is 18 feet. 71/2
inches.

All eyes rill be i'ocuse-d on the

Although the Panther first team

lie with the mediocre second te-air.

in their initial contest the var-
sity team trampled the second

Last year the Sammies were re-

are showing a better all around
team.

Sammies Slug Hard

Against the SAE’s last Tuesday
afternoon the defending champions
literally tore their opponents apart
as they connected with three
homers to mount up the score. Har-
ry Abramovitz, Joe Aaron, and
Bobby Colton were the three Sam-
mies to hit for the circuit.

“Red” Silverman pitched con-
sistent ball throughout the fray,
and although not another Mendlow,
he should carry the mound ‘burden
satisfactorily.

Keeping in step with the Sam-
mies were the hard hitting Phi Ep
squad who beat the Phi Delts, 10--5.
The battle was close tor the first
three innings, but then the Phi Ep
powerhouse went to town and drove
over ﬁye runs to clinch the tilt.

Shortstop Wally Hirsch and
pitcher Jay Silverberg hit home
runs with baserunners on the paths
to give the victors the deciding
edge. Bob Bell, third baseman of

he Phi Delts, played a ﬁne deten-
sive game, and hit a homer with
two men on base to give the Phi
Eps a scare.

the diamond squad, and it is impos-
sible tor them to attend more than
a low of the football drills.

The present backﬁeld for the var-
sity has Walt West at the signal
calling’ post, Johnny Ross at full-
back, and Bill Dutton and Jack
Stetler at the halves.

Ross and Dutton stole the show
in the opening fracas as they each

tallied two touchdowns. It was
thought at the beginning of prac-

tice that replacing George Kracum
would be difficult, but if the pres-
ent showing of Ross is any criterion,
he will carry the plunging position
ade-quately.

West, sophomore letterman, will
be a sure bet for quarterback when
Pitt meets Purdue in their opening
game. F“ran.k Saksa and Bill Dut-
ton. have been ﬁghting for Bobby
Thurbon.’s halfback post, while Ed-
gar Jones takes over the other wing
back post when the opening game
arrives.

On the line, where the unsung
heroes play, lack of su.bstit;utes is
apparent. Stan Gervelis will be
the starting left end in tomor-
row’s game with Tex I-linte as the
probable other starter.

Steve Sinco has won. the center
post hands down, tor his defensive
play has marked every practice
thus tar this season. In two years
as a starter, Steve has been erratic,
but this year he has improved con-
siderably.

H'a.:r'ry Kindelberger will start to-
rnorrow’s contest at one tackle po-
sition, while the other side oi‘ the
line is still a mystery". Bill Beng-
hauser seemed a sure bet for a
tackle post; this year, but the olrait
board. got him.

Diamond Squad
Rated. Favorite
In Army Match

Injury Makes Malloy
Questionable Starter

Eighteen players plus members
of the athletic department will
leave Pittsburgh this morning for
West Point, New York, where the
Panther baseball nine will meet
one or the best Army teams in re-
cent years tomorrow afternoon.

Acoording to baseball coach Ralph
Mitterling, practically the same
squad who made the southern trip
will be carried on the Pitt invasion
of the Army stronghold. The party
will leave Pittsburgh by automo-
bile and arrive in VVest. Point in
time to see the Cadets drill before
game time.

Perhaps the only sour note in the
whole Pitt baseball picture is the
tact that outstanding hurler Bob
lvlalloy may be lost for the Army
game due to elbow injuries suf-
fered during spring football drills.
At the present time, however, it is
believed that Malloy will be named
to work on the mound against the
Army team.

Should the injuries prevent Mal-
loy irom taking the ﬁeld, the start-
ing assignment probably will be
given to ace footballer Eddie Jones.
The junior right hander turned in
both wins on the southern trip and
should give the Cadets plenty of
trouble.

Except for the shortstop spot,
which still has Coach Mitterling
puzzled, the Panther lineup against
the Army nine is fairly well set.
Indications are that shortstop Ja-
cobs will. be replaced by Johnny
Vafksnor, veteran of the 1940
squad. There -is a possibility also
that Jacobs may be shifted to third
base should Bonelli falter.

Pitt will enter the game with
Army slightly lavored due to a
wealth of oﬁensive punch. The ad-
dition of Eddie Straloski at second
base plus the greatly improved
hitting of catcher Guy Guadagnino
makes Pitt a better than average
hitting team.

Both Straloski and Guadagnino
hit the ball hard on the southern
trip, accounting almost entirely for
the Panther total of hits. The lat-
ter boy managed to register two
home runs against the opposition
south of the Mason-Dixon. line.

The Panthers will take the ﬁeld
against the future oﬁicers of the
army at approximately 1 o’clock in
the afternoon.

The party will return to Pitts-
burgh immediately following the
game.

All-Campus Swim Meet
Rescheduled Tuesday

0 By SHEME EAZELL

Because of a misunderstanding
as to the speciﬁc starting time, the
all-campus swimming meet, origin-
ally scheduled for last Wednesday,
has been postponed until next
Tuesday in the Trees pool at 5
o’clock.

A list of those swimmers quali-
ﬁed to compete in the meet has
been compiled on the basis of. the
recent e~li.mination. tournaments
held by the fraternities, independ-
ents, and engineers.

Nine events are listed for the all-
campus fracas. In the first event,
the 120-yard medley relay, the fra-
ternities and independents have two
teams entered, while the engineers
have qualified one team.

The Phi Gamma Delta trio of
Potter, Bitner, and Mitchell, and
the Pi Lambda Phi threesome oi
I_.eVi.ne, Krongole, and Jubelirer
for the fraternities, Kurran, Gross-
man, Sutnick on one, and Bilowich,
Notaro, and Hornnack on the other
or the independent entries, with
l\/losko, Shulness, and Shank swim-
ming for the engineers, will each
be trying for first place points in
the medley relay.

Entered in the 100-yard free
style race for the fraternities are
Fialg;-h Wilde and Reese, while the
Independents have Jerry Zaslov
slated. The Engineers are not com-
peting.

For the 60-yard individual med-
ley. the :'ra‘..ernities halve Robinson
and Barrish, the €I“;gl}’l€€l'S will use
l"~Te'us.t.e;?n, and the Independents
have qualiﬁed Mos}-:0. In the div-
ing duels, each oi the three con-
tenders have entered a pair of
s;.rir:g"board men. Yolten and Ju-
beiirer perform for  fraternities
Patterson and S-hulness for the en-
g:§r.ee:":-:. and lVlcCe;ﬁ°ert;: and No-

pendent mermen Zaslov and Rape-
port may show. And again in the

Hanson Speaks

Aiiolii Activities

 S. A_*merica‘ ‘
YMCA Group Hears

Speaker on Monday

Extra curricular act“.-'ities for
‘students in South Ameri:an,col-
lleges and universities consist pri-
:marily of discussions of interna-
tional politics and creation of an

‘undercurrent against the potential
-'rr-aziﬁcation of South American
-countries. -

This part of students and educa-
;.tion in the South American orien-
tation“ towards the United States
; will be revealed when Wayne Han-
son, world traveler ‘and lecturer,
», recently returned from these coun-
ty tries, addresses the Upperclass club
_of the YMCA Monday at 12:30
gdclock in 1228 Cathedral.
1 Djssussing student life in South
’_Amer’can colleges and universi-
:1 ties, Hanson will express student
7views on international iproblems.
‘All persons interested in hearing
*the special lecture should sign up

for YWCA ’0fﬁ_ces. Billie Ann

E‘Swank, C42, and Walter Dickinson,

luncheon.

Hanson". lecturing this week in
‘Pittsburgh under the sponsorship
of the general YMCA, will relate
details of his inside information
?obtained from South American
;statesmen, journalists, and educa-
tors. The interpreter of foreign
eﬁairs spent the entire year of 1940
in direct ‘observation and study of
=,South American countries, after
5 having spent several years in Eu-
- rope.  ‘ 3
A According to press releases of his
observations, Hanson has seen a
. Nazi trend in these countries that is
. due to inﬂuence of German citizens
sand missions who have nazified
 their armies; and prop-agandized
 South vAmerican peoples. This
g’ trend, however, has been stopped,
igpartially by the attitude of the stu-

the scenery got lost. strayed, or
