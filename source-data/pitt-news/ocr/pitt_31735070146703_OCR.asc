And the price—by—the—pound winners are.

_ Patrick Wagner
Staff Writer

When the dining dollars are getting low and Market Central just isn’t cutting it anymore, you need an alternative. .
Thankfully, Oakland offers a plethora of restaurants trying to meet your needs with prices that are in most cases notoriously reasonable for the college student’s
budget. But exactly how good of a deal are these eateries? Concentrating on Oakland’s most popular take—out dish rivalries, we weighed them and compared their
prices per pound.. These are the (admittedly amateur) scientiﬁc results. i

Pittsburgh Popcorn Co.
3710 Fifth Ave

Monday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.,

Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Students can grab something both sweet
and salty now as they wander down Fifth
Avenue between Atwood and Oakland av-
enues. V
The new branch of the Pittsburgh Pop-
corn Co., the third in the local franchise,
opened last week. The two other stores
operate in the Strip District and Down-
town, and each store caters to a different
market, according to owner Rob Day. F
“We saw a pretty good market in terms
of college kids,” Day said about the Oak-
land store. “People need a snack. If you
look around Oakland, there aren’t a ton
of snacks. Rita’s is seasonal, but this you
can get all year round.” ' V
The Oakland store is small —— there’s
a counter, carnival—themed posters and
decorations, a popcorn maker and bins

of fresh and ﬂavored popcorn. There’s no
sitting room — people get their popcorn
and go. There are free samples so people
can taste and pick their favorite from nine
or 10 gourmet popcorn ﬂavors, which
rotate and change by the week. Flavors
include cheddar, chocolate, kettle, peanut
butter and s’mores, as well as a Flavor of
the Week.

“We strive for the best popcorn expe-
rience possible and buy fresh products,
including all—natural fresh cheese and
caramel,” Day said. “I haté using the term
‘gourmet’ since it’s overused, but it’s gour-
met popcorn.”

Day and his wife began the Pittsburgh
Popcorn Co. after meeting in a popcorn
shop in New York City. Genalle Day, a
Pittsburgh local, wanted to bring the same
experience to her hometown. Rob Day

happily agreed, and they soon opened

their ﬁrst store in the Strip District in

"2008.

“We thought, Pittsburgh never had [a
popcorn store,] so we thought it would be

Simkin: It’s what your
mother ordered

For sick college students, Sarah offersa few home remedies

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

When you’re sick at college, you might not
be able to have your mom sing to you or
access your favorite TV Land reruns. There
is one comfort, however, that’s deﬁnitely
still available: food. “

The right foods can make you feel better
faster, or at least make colds and viruses

more bearable-

Here are a few home remedies, I’ve
stumbled upon. Note, however, that the
best advice will come from a doctor, who
can tell you what will work best for your
body and your ailment.

Soup

Soup is a natural choice — it’s soothing for
sore throats and gentle on upset stomachs.
But, opt for a chicken or vegetable—stock
based soup rather than cream. Cream
soups are often higher in calories and
saturated fat than their non—dairy coun-
terparts, and dairy has a lovely tendency to
aid in mucus production —-— not desirable
if you’re already going through boxes of
tissues by the hour. .

Other advantages of soup? If you’re

cold medicine—drugged you are. Soups
packaged for individual servings, like
Campbell’s Soup at Hand line, are tempt-
ingly easy but often utilize high amounts
of sodium as preservatives and ﬂavor en-
hancers. Share a can with a friend or pop
the extra serving in the fridge for later.-

Sweets

I
I

Ice cream has restorative properties for
everything from strep throat to a bro-
ken heart, but once again, beware: dairy

. products are not your friends if you’re

already plagued with sinus issues. And
just because you’re sick doesn’t mean the
calories, sugars and fats aren’t injurious
to your diet.

If you’re craving something cold and
the caveats mentioned above are issues
for you, try a comparatively healthier fruit
popsicle or even those colorful, friendly
tubes of childhood summers past, Freez-
epops.

I mean, everybody loves popcorn.”

a Pittsburgh product.”
Anyone is welcome to sample any ﬂa-

Jarad Bailey, the Oakland store man-
ager, loves popcorn as much as the owners
and happily sells the treats while offering
free samples to passers-by and anyone
who steps inside the store.

“Popcorn is a super fun product,” Bai-
ley said. “The idea is to be nostalgic and
offer a new spin on something people
already love.”

The Pittsburgh Popcorn Co. has differ-
ent themes and different Flavors of the
Week in each store, but the experience is
meant to be the same at each location.

“All of our popcorn is made fresh every
day,” Bailey said. “If you go to another
store, it isn’t as fresh. It doesn’t taste as
good. We probably make the best pop-
corn on the east coast,‘ period. And it’s

vor in the store andnot feel obligated to
buy popcorn, but for those who give into
the temptation, there are three different
bag and tin sizes.

Rather than sell multiple items and
have them suffer in quality, the business
sells only popcorn so that its sole product
can be at its best, according to Rob Day,

- who has designed and implemented most

of the ﬂavors.

“I wake up one morning and have it in
my head that this will be a great taste,”
he said about the flavors. “I just come up
with it out of thin air.”

Store hours may change in the future
as the popcorn company settles into the
Oakland area. The store expects to accept
Panther Funds within two weeks.-

Local cupcake shops invent new flavors

Natalie Bell
A&E Editor

It’s nearly midnight in the quaint, pastel-
colored Dozen Bake Shop, and hundreds of
unadorned cupcakes are nestled neatly in
their boxes, waiting to be iced and shipped
out to other Dozen locations.

_ Dozen, like many other bakeries, has
noticed a boom in the popularity of these
single-serve treats. In the past several
years, production has gone up, but the
petite kitchen, where vibrant sprinkles
and industrial portions of ﬂour and sugar
are stacked along the walls, has retained
its tranquil charm.

“It’s small compared to the amount of
workwe do, but we_ never get in each other’s
way,?’ said Josie Smith, a bakerand 200‘?
Pittsburgh Culinary Institute graduate.
The shop is known for outlandish ﬂa-
vors like Margarita and Twinkilicious and
is fearless in trying new and different com-
binations.
‘‘[James, the owner] gives us the free-
dom to try different flavors,” Smith said.
“If he’s done it, we have to think of a way

Tea, VitaminC heal

If the BRAT d1'etisn’tfor you, turn to drinks and minerals.

Simkin 4 8

applesauce and toast. Possible extensions
include tea and yogurt —— BRATTY, if you
will. I could easily recommend a dozen
ways to spice them up, but that would de-
feat the purpose. I will say —— although I
concede I cannot back this up with sci-
entiﬁc research — that toast is greatly
enhanced by Nutella, which at least con-
tributes protein.

On the same order as the BRAT diet are
Saltine crackers, a classic saline staple
of sick days. Pretzels will also address
the craving for salt, which the Internet
and my chemistry major roommate tell
me is a common symptom of unbalanced
electrolytes.

I could go on a bit about electrolytes,
but this is a food column, and thus bio-
chemistry and health ramblings are not
exactly what you’re here for. Spicy foods
like horseradish or red peppers may open
up your sinuses, which can be invigorating,
but these are ill-advised if your stomach
is at all troubling you.

Drinks

I cannot stress enough the importance ‘of

staying hydrated during an illness.

And remember: hydration is not soda
or energy drinks. I’ll reserve passing judg-
ment on vitamin waters and Gatorade, but
plain and simple water is your best bet.

The one exception to the water rule?
Brewed water. Tea is an invaluable tactic in
the war on sore throats. Plain is perfectly
ﬁne, but caffeine-free chamomile or mint
may help you sleep better. .

For an upset stomach, try grating some
fresh ginger into hot water. It’s ﬁne by
itself or with honeyor lemon juice. Plain
ginger is another option, in candied or raw
form. I like The Ginger People’s original
ﬂavor Ginger‘Chews, which you can usu-
ally ﬁnd at Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods.
Less adventurous? Ginger Ale soda also
works.

Vitamin C

Vitamin C is widely touted as beneﬁcial
for ﬁghting off colds. Luckily, it’s not a
tricky nutrient to come by.— it’s pres-
ent in many fruits and subsequently, fruit
beverages.
Get well soon. I

to do it better.”

In addition to their two staple cup-
cake ﬂavors — Vanilla Vanilla and Milk
Chocolate —— this week the workers will
introduce their new fall cupcake creations,
which will include tastes of pumpkin, apple
and one that will include maple and ba-
con. i

Dozen isn’t the only shop to notice the
baby cake boom, nor are they the only ones
who plan on sampling the cornucopia of
tastes that autumn has to offer.

Vanilla Pastry Studio, which received
the moniker of “best cupcakes in Pitts-
burgh” in 2007 from the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, began making miniature—sized
versions of the morsels after receiving
the title. _ .

“They’re small; They’re kind of portion
controlled. They’re cute and fun, and when
you get cupcakes for a party you can get
many ﬂavors,” said April Gruver, owner
and self-proclaimed Sugar Fairy.

Gruver, who is a pastry chef, insists
on making everything from scratch. She
explains that even the cookies that go into

their cookies and cream items are home- -
made. And this year, she plans_on using

the abundance of local foods to whip up
some delectable goodies.
“We are really ingredient driven  we

go to the farmers’ markets,” she said.

She plans on bringing back a favorite of
many during these months of scarves and
golden leaves -— fresh Concord grape —— as
well as creating a carrot cupcake with a
"brown buttercream cheese icing. T

For another local eatery, Priory Fine
Pastries, variety is the spice of life. With
their custom cupcake creations, like their
Chocolate Knockout ﬂavor and their three-
pound Colossal Cupcake, they’re prepared
to please all kinds of sweet-toothed eat-
ers.

“We see certain ﬂavors that sell, and
we try to stick with those ﬂavors,” head
bakerjim Lazeration said!

The bakery — whose favored ﬂavors,
according to Lazeration, are probably the
Carrot Cake or Raspberry Ganache — tries
to uphold a certain standard of decadent
desserts, and that means staying true to
the classics. '

“We don’t get into crazy ﬂavors  I be-
lieve that when you’re getting into sweets,
you should stick with the basic stuff, stuff
that should be in desserts,” he said.

Whether it’s unique ﬂavor combina-
tions, goods made with local ingredi-
ents or the sweet classics they’ve always
loved, Pittsburghers seem to love their
cupcakes. I

  lnsearch of China

Ditch General Tso ’s for a few authentic Chinese dishes

Jennifer Hirsch
Staff Writer

I’m going to let you all in on a little se-
cret: General Tso’s Chicken is not Chinese
food.

Sure, it’s a popular dish at Oakland Av-
enue’s cache of Chinese restaurants. But al-
low me to reiterate — General Tso’s Chicken
is not Chinese food.

By now you’re probably looking at my
byline. “Hirsch,” you think to yourself,
“that certainly doesn’t seem Chinese. Why
should I believe her?”

Simple. In August of 2009, I moved to
Shanghai to begin a year—long study abroad
program in China. Although based in the
Middle Kingdom’s most international city,
I traveled extensively throughout the coun-
try —— north to Beijing and Harbin, west
to Inner Mongolia and Xi’an, south to the
minority villages of the Guangxi province

. and ﬁnally out to Taiwan. In all my search-

ing, Mr. Tso — supposedly named after the
Qing Dynasty general Zuo Zongtang — was
nowhere to be found.

I instead treated my western—trained
tongue to an amazing selection of authentic
Chinese food — food so savory it brought a
grin to my lips, so spicy my taste buds went
into hiding and haven’t returned.

So if you’re sick of ordering General Tso’s
every time — and trust me, the woman
behind the counter taking your order is

too —— be adventurous and try some of the —

following at Taiwan Cafe, Sushi Boat or
Szechuan Express:

Eggplant dishes: I hated eggplant before
I left for China, but then a dish roughly
translated as “ﬁsh—ﬂavored eggplant”

‘ rocked my world. Its melt—in-your-mouth

richness made it an instant favorite of the
foreigners trying to adjust to their new
diets. Translated as “Eggplant with Garlic
Sauce” at both Taiwan Cafe and Szechuan
Express, the dish isn’t _as sweet as what I’m
used to,’ so I’d suggest trying their eggplant
and pork combination instead. ,

_ Mongolian Beef: Sushi Boat surprised
‘me with this one. Because the owners are
not from Japan but Fujian, a coastal city
in southern China, I’d suggest ordering off
the Chinese menu the next time you visit.
Speciﬁcally, I adored the Mongolian Beef
dish —— tender strips of savory meat mixed
with sweet onions and scallions felt like
home to my China—yearning stomach. L

Mapo Toﬁi/Bean Curd: The “ma” in Mapo
Tofu comes from the Chinese adjective for
numbing spiciness, a main characteristic of
Sichuan cuisine. It’s offered at each of the
above—mentioned restaurants at varying
levels of intensity. Szechuan Express’ is the
spiciest —— not altered for an American’s
pain threshold — while Taiwan Cafe’s and
Sushi Boat’s will be more palatable for most

readers. But tread carefully at the latter. ~

When I asked how spicy their version was,
the Sushi Boat owner winked wickedly at
me, saying he might “add a little bit” if he
thought I could handle it.

Sautéed Green Beans: Another foreigner
favorite, the beans are sauteed in honey and
soy sauce to crunchy perfection and then
topped with hot peppers and garlic.

These dishes will never be as delicious as
their China counterparts, but, in addition
to ordering the food itself, there are certain
steps you can take to make the experience of
eating at Taiwan Cafe, Sushi Boat or Szech-
uan Cafe a bit more authentic.

First: Go with friends. Chinese meals are

meant to be shared. As the ﬂavors of indi-
vidual dishes can be rather concentrated
and overwhelming, you only do yourself
a disservice by going alone. Case in point:.
Last time I was at Taiwan Cafe, a Chinese
student asked me with a rather accusatory
tone, “Why are you ordering takeout?” I
sheepishly answered that I had to study.
Now I know better — from then on I made a
point of making my dinners an actual meal,
not just a dine—and~dash.
‘ Second: Ditch the fork and learn how to"
use chopsticks. In Chinese dining, you’re
rarely served a large steak or unwieldy veg-
etable — everything is bite—size and thus
perfect for eating with the more authentic
utensils. If you ﬁnd them difficult to use,
try placing your hands higher to increase
dexterity. Also, I like to rub my chopsticks
together in amotion similar to sharpening
knives to eliminate unwanted wood’ shav-
ings and splinters.

Third: If you’re 21 or older, pair your
meal with a cold Tsingtao, the national beer
of China, or if not, order a tapioca milk
tea —— both sold at Taiwan Cafe. I didn’t

' understand the bubble tea phenomenon

when I ﬁrst arrived in China. As a “texture
eater,” I decided that marble-sized goo on
the bottom of an incredibly sweet drink was
not forme. But it turns out that the milk
helps coat your stomach and prevents the
irritation greasy American Chinese food
might cause. I normally order black tea but
sometimes get the taro ﬂavor for a twist.
Fourth: Don’t be afraid to make a little
noise. It’s perfectly acceptable —— and
even considered a compliment — to slurp
loudly and burp during a meal. Soup can be

drained right from your bowl, too. .  I

So, there you have it. China may not
have the esteemed culinary reputation of
Europe-, but delicious meals can be found if
you’rearmed with the right knowledge and
a bit of courage. And if I see you walking
down Oakland Avenue with a container of
General Tso’s or L0 Mein in your hand, be

“ assured that I will march you back- up the .

street to correct your mistake. .

Experts discuss adoption in law building

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬁ” Writer

Despite wide reform in American adoption
practices, adult adoptees in some US. states are
challenging laws that prevent them from learn-
ing the identities of their biological parents.

Elizabeth Samuels, a professor at the Uni-
versity of Baltimore Law School, discussed
this issue and others that pertain to adoption
yesterday afternoon during her lecture ‘Adop-
tion, Identity and Conﬁdentiality: The History
of Closed Records.” ‘

Samuels spoke to a crowd of about 50

0 people gathered in a classroom of the Barco

Law Building, providing a detailed history
of the traditions and legislation associated
with adoption. She said one of the ongoing
issues surrounding adoption practices today
involves people’s ability to access their birth
certiﬁcates. , -

Kansas, Alaska, Maine, Oregon, Alabam .
and New Hampshire are the few states that .

allow unrestricted access to birth records for
adult adoptees, Samuels said. .Pennsylvania’s
birth records have been closed to adult adop-
tees since 1984, keeping some people from

. identifying their biological parents.

According to adopteerightspaorg, adult
adoptees must “petition the courts of the
county their adoption took place”’to receive
their original birth certiﬁcate, and can only

receive the document with permission from .

their birth parents.

State Rep. Curtis G. Sonney, R-Erie, and Rep.
Kerry Benninghoff, R-Centre, have introduced
House Bills 1968 and 1978, respectively, aimed
at changing PennsylVania’s policies regarding
access to birth records.

' Liberty Hultberg, Pemisylvania state rep-
resentative for American Adoption Congress,
said in an e—mail that House Bill 1978 is pre-
ferred by most in the adoption community.
According to its brochure, American Adop-
tion Congress is an-“intemational network of
individuals and organizations committed to
promoting truth about adoption.”

The new legislation would allow people to
obtain their original birth certiﬁcates that list
their original names, birth parents’ names and
place of birth, Hultberg, a member of Pitt’s
English faculty, said.

She said it’s important for students and
citizens to understand adoption issues, such
as free access to birth records.

“There are so many long-standing miscon-
ceptions out there, such as that birth mothers
want nothing to do with their relinquished
children and want ‘protection’ from them,”
Hultberg said. “Adopted persons are the only
ones in our culture who do not retain the right
to their birth certiﬁcates. It can be a hazard not
only to identity formation but also health.”

During the lecture, Samuels said that from
the 1850s to the 1920s states began to regulate
adoptions. Before that time, many adopted

children were not issued a birth certiﬁcate, _

making it nearly impossible to locate biological

. parents or family.

To give ﬁirther perspective on the diﬂi-
culties and joys of adoption, Samuels showed
the 1946 movie “To Each His Own,” a drama
centered around awoman who gave birth to an
illegitimate son who was then adopted.

Samuels says she supports the right to non-
restrictive access because it is a “basic human
right to know your identity.”

Pitt’s School of Arts and Sciences spon-
sored the lecture along with the School of Law,
Women’s Studies Programand the Pittsburgh
Consortium for Adoption Studies. Marianne
Novy, a professor in the English department,
organized the lecture. I

Study Abroad
Fair today

Tegan Hanlon
For The Pitt News

Pitts Study Abroad Oﬁice will host its Fall Study
Abroad Fair today from 11 am to 3 p.m. in the
William Pitt Union Assembly Room to help stu-
dents answer questions they might have about
studying abroad. _

The fair will introduce students to the wide
variety of study abroad options available to them,
said Tiffany Martin, director of the University
Center for International Studies.

Students can choose from about 800 dilfer-
ent programs, Martin said. Some programs are
as short as two weeks, while others last for a ﬁill
37331? A '

Representatives from both PantherPrograms
and study abroad programs aﬁiliated with Pitt
will table at the fair. Panther Programs are study
abroad programs puttogetherby Pittfaculty; the
classes taken while abroad go toward academic
credit, and most count toward a student’s GPA.

Pitt alumni who have previously participated
inprogramswill also attendthefairto speakwith
students, and -Study Abroad Office interns will

answer questions about many programs. The _

Study Abroad Ofﬁce worked with about 1,400
students who went abroad last year.

Program manager and Study Abroad adviser
Ben Pilcher said the Study Abroad program is
constantly growing. The University tries to add
one or more programs each year.

Newthisyearis aPittinGreece Program, as
wellasaPittinIndiaProgramintheHimalayas,
both set for summer 2011.

Intern Timothy Kraus has studied in Chile,
Peru and Germany through the ofﬁce. He said he
believes that almost anyone can ﬁnd a location to
suit his or her needs.

“Students who wantanin—depth cultural back
ﬂip — Eastern European, African, Asian, and
South American countries are a good choice. For
those who may not want a complete 180, there
are Western European andAustralianprograms,”
Kraus said. . ‘

Both Kraus and Martin said the advantages of
spending time abroad are numerous. ‘

“Being able to immerse yourselfcompletelyin
any culture is an eye-opening decision,” he said.
“Pitt  itvery easy to study abroad compared
to other universities.” . ‘

Martin cited studyingabroad as away for stu-
dents to set themselves apart at graduation.

“It is a great opportunity for students to gain
knowledge about a diiferent region,” he said. “It
shows ﬁxture employers that you are willing to
leave western Pennsylvania.”

Those planningto go abroad should startplan-
ning a year in advance, Martin said. They should
also talk to their advisers and save some general
education requirements thatcanbefulﬁlled while
abroad. For more information students can go to
www.abroad.pitt.edu or visit the Study Abroad

Although Trader Joe’s can expand people ’s food horizons, the store’s inner workings warrant consumer concern.

Kayla Hunter
For The Pitt News

 

The ﬁrst time I went to Traderjoe’s, I fell
into some kind of embarrassing grocery
infatuation. It was as if someone had been
taking note of all the elite organic items I
wistfully pushed my cart past in Giant Eagle
and-Whole Foods, gathered them up and
plopped them down in one compactvstore,
then removed the brand label and lowered
the prices. Pure foodie heaven. '

It wasn’t until the honeymooner eupho-
ria ebbed that .I started noticing that my

crackersmwere triple-packaged and that —-— ' I

wait, my zucchini is in a package too? And
why exactly is this organic tofu cheaper
than its counterpart .in Whole Foods? Is it
just the generic factor, or is there some-
thing else going on here?

Until about a month ago, when Fortune
magazine published the results of three
months of journalistic probing of Trader
_]oe’s, I would’ve probably been answered
bysilence.

It turns out that, despite the exuber-
ant employees and cartoon-like packaging,
Trader Joe’s at the corporate level is a bit

of a recluse. Its headquarters in Monrovia,
Calif., bears no name or logo. The owners,
the Albrecht family in Germany who also
control Aldi, have a long-standing policy of
secrecy as to their business practices-

According to Fortune, this is partly be-
cause TraderJoe’s doesn’tgwant its custom- '
ers or competitors to know from whom
it’s getting its products. Often they come
from large brand names, like Pepsi and
Stonyﬁeld Farm, which sell to TraderJoe’s
at lower prices because ofits high turnover
rate. ‘ I

To achieve this, Trader Joe’s puts a lot
of time into carefully choosing specialty
products from around the world that will
go over well with its customer base. It also
cutsout middlemen by buying directly from
manufacturers and shipping to its own con-
veniently placed distribution centers. ,

Trader_Ioe’s then stocks its shelves with
items that make up only about 8 percent
of the amount of products at other grocery
stores. The result is that, with less distract-
ing clutter and products that are honed in
to a particular taste, these items go fast.
And because they sell fast, produlcerscan
afford to cut prices.

Okay, so the hush-hush was really just

 

' lost in the wake.

to keep efﬁcient business practices under
wrap, not to cover up slave labor or some-
thing like that. In fact, salaries of full-time
TraderJoe’s employees can start from any-
where between $40,000 to $60,000 with
impressive retirement beneﬁts, according
to the article. This explains why so many
of the people ringing up my almonds and
veggie pizza sport gray hairs and wedding
rings. Or at least why they don’t seem to be
miserable job—loathers. '

TraderJoe’s prides itself on being _more
of a neighborhood shop than a chain, with
yellow bridges hanging -from the ceiling
and murals of the city on the walls of the
Pittsburgh store. But it is stilla chain, one
that continues to expand, and many express
worries that this homegrown vibe will get

But this is a sad old tune, one that is
manifest in the" changes that have taken
place in the organic movement that paved
the way for specialty stores like Trader
Joe’s. Once a smattering of -smallfarms
run by some idealistic‘ hippies, organic
food comprised a $24.8 billion industry
in 2009, according to the Organic Trade
Association. ' I -

In a business sense, this is a wild suc-

cess. But for those who valued organic for

its small-scale relationship with the earth,‘

a proliferation of certiﬁed chemical—free
industrial products is a bit of a let down.
Author Michael Pollan concludes his book,
“The Omnivore’s Dilemma,” by stating that
this system, is in fact contradictory, and
that while sometimes we have to live with

contradictions, “we ought [to] at least face

up to the cost of our compromises.”

And that’s what Trader Joe’s is, too:va
compromise. My initial ardor for the store
was more a hopethat_it would be a cheap
answer to all my food and health gripes,
which it’s not. There are things Iwish it’d
change, particularly packaging, but I’m still
going to shop there for a lot of my groceries
because, well, I like it. . V

Before TraderJoe’s, I never thought to
pick up tamaleslor Greek yogurt or stroop-
wafels. It may be an oddly tight-lipped cor-

poration, and it may be _environmentally7
imperfect like the rest of the world, but’

I’m not ready to begin foraging for my food
in the woods to avoid all these well-inten-
tioned yet, imperfect systems.

Sorry, Mother Earth. In the meantime,

Ranalli: For Yeasayer, experience varies with concert venue 

Christina Ranalli
Staﬁwriter

This summer, I was lucky enough to watch
Yeasayer perform at Lollapalooza in Chicago.
Last Saturday, I — along with thousands of
others — saw Yeasayer perform at Virgin
Mobil’s FreeFest in Columbia, Maryland.
This Tuesday, I — along with about ‘650
others — saw the band perform at a sold-
out Mr. Small’s Fun House right here in
Pittsburgh.

After driving through multiple states
.— six, to be exact — to watch each perfor-
mance, I wasproud to conclude that Yeasay-
er’s Pittsburgh show was, hands down, the
best experience of the three. I came to this
conclusion via the scientiﬁc method.
Hypothesis: The Venue Changes Every-
thing p -

Variable 1: Weather 4

I believe most people at Lollapalooza
saw the Sunday morning rain as a burden.
By Yeasayer’s afternoon show, however, the

blue skies and sunshine were also accompa-

nied by unbearable heat.

“The heat is making me delusional,” vo-
calist Chris Keating said before their ﬁnal
song, “Ambling Alp.”

The same heat wave seemed to sweep
across Maryland during FreeFest as well. At
close to 100 degrees, I saw two people pass
out and get carried away on stretchers as the
members of Yeasayer continued performing

MOVIE REVIEW

“The Social Network”
Starring:]esse Eisenberg,]ustin Timber-

Grade: A -

Just before I walked into a theater at the Water-
front, I grabbed the BlackBerry in my purse and
almost instinctively refreshed my Facebook.
While I was mid-wall post, the bouncer at the

entrance asked me to turn off my phone for »

the duration of the’ ﬁlm. As I realized I would
have to survive the next two hours without my
BlackBerry, I felt my chest tighten. What would
I do ifa couple changed their relationship status
and I was the last to know?

Ironically enough, the ﬁlm I sacriﬁced, my
phone for was “The Social Network.”

in their sweat—stained tank tops.

At Mr. Small’s, however, the mix of the fall
night air that blew through the open doors
and the air conditioning made the sold—out
venue cool and comfortable.

Variable 2: Visuals

Both music festivals were lacking in dis-

tinctive images. Since Yeasayer played in .

the afternoon at both outdoor venues, the
hot rays of the sun replaced the wildly dis-
torted visual show. The bandmates were in
full View the entire time, and the suspense
was lacking.

Last Tuesday night, however, Yeasayer
‘invaded Mr. Small’s with psychedelic lights‘:
and fog that complimented each song. The
band members were hidden by the darkness
in between most numbers, but they never

stopped playing. It added something to the -
performance and set them apart from oth- *

er bands. During the song “The Children,”
while Keating sang with his ‘electronically
pitch—shifted demonic voice, the stage was il-
luminated in an equally chilling red light.

Variable 3: The Crowd

Both of Yeasayer’s festival performances
at Lollapalooza and FreeFest were swarming
with hundreds upon hundreds of attendees,
but don’t let that fool'you — people were in
and out: watching, laying, talking, drinking,
laughing, smoking and dancing.

Also, the crowd had choices. At Lollapa-
looza,-fans chose between Yeasayer, Chiddy

' Bang, Hockey and The Verve Pipe, while at

FreeFest, the band overlapped withjoanjett, H

The Blackhearts and Neon Indian. Also, the
majority of the crowd stood in place when
Yeasayer left the stage at 5 p.m., anxiously
awaiting MGMT, who came on at 6 p.m.
The crowd at the band’s Pittsburgh per-
formance was lively and excited. I arrived at
Mr. Small’s a little after 9 p.m. The tickets
had been sold out for'hours, and the venue
was shoulder-to—shoulder with eager fans. I
can use the word “fans” here because that’s

exactly what these people were. The majority

of the audience sang all the words song after
song while dancing the awkward concert
bob. There were even those who took up at
least four standing spots just so they could
feel the rhythm.

Variable 4: The Sound

Outdoor venues tend to lack the depth
and richness of a smaller venue like Mr.
Small’s. The music tends to trail off, some-
times even mixing with the acts from the
stages nearby, and it’s very easy to hear the
conversations of the people next to you — if
you’re even lucky enough to ﬁnd a spot up
close. Yeasayer’s songs are comprised of
many details and played with bizarre instru-
ments that can’t be heard to their fullest
while outside, surrounded by thousands
of_people. ,

At capacity, Mr. Small’s ﬁts 650 people.
Large sets of amps framed the stage, which
caused the sound to echo and bounce off
the high ceilings of the former chapel. I

. felt the vibrations up through the wooden

ﬂoorboards, and’couldn’t hear anyone else’s

rendition of the songs over the pure volume .

of each bandmember’s instrument.
Yeasayer’s sound is experimental and

original to say the least, but to close it into a

small space with such an enthusiastic atmo-

sphere was what made the experience.
Conclusion:

As I watched Keating and his fellow -

bandmates dance in circles and throw their
hands in the air at Mr. Small’s, I realized
that it doesn’t matter how many people at—')
tend a show —- it’s how dedicated they are.
Yeasayer absorbed the energy of each fan
and jammed it right back to the crowd, which
made the Pittsburgh performance the most
intimate and enjoyable of the three. I

‘likes’ Facebook flick ‘The Social Network’

Network” is the story of how Facebook came

to fruition. It begins in 2003, when founder _

Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), toys with
the idea of creating a social networking site
from his Harvard dorm room. The ﬁlm then
follows Eisenberg’s‘character as he succeeds in
launching the site, gains notoriety and tries to

. fend of simultaneous lawsuits from his peers ‘

and his former best friend.

Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the ﬁlm’s phe-
nomenal screenplay, ensures that the audience
both hates and sympathizes with almost every
character. The dialogue isquick-witted, origi-

. nail and ﬁinny, and the action is dramatic but

plausible.

- Adding to this is the ﬁlm’s exceptional cast-
ing. The all—star lineup includesjustin Timber-
lake, Rashidajones and newcomers Andrew
Garﬁeld, Armie Hammer and Rooney Mara,
as well as Disney’s' Brenda Song. Moviegoers
couldn’t ask for a more believable portrayal of
each character. I

In particular, Jesse Eisenberg pulls off the

‘socially awkward Zuckerberg so well it’s easy —

to forget he’s just acting. As his invention be-
gins to consume his environment, Eisenberg’s
character — in essence a conflicted and lonely
kid —— tries to cope with the consequences of
his actions. He showcases Zuckerberg’s achieve-

ements while simultaneously highlighting the

price he paid socially and how it affected him
on a personal level. _ ’

Andrew Garﬁeld’s portrayal of Eduardo
Saverin, a co-founder, of the site, is also excep-
tional. Garﬁeld does well to balance Saverin’s
incredible need for acceptance and approval
from his father with his desire to stand up for
himself. Garﬁeld’s character develops beauti-
fully throughout the duration of the ﬁlm. By
the end, Saverin isn’t afraid to ‘go after what he
wants and make sure his voice is heard.

If Eisenberg’s character lit the fire that be-
came his multi—billion dollar empire, Timber-
lake’s character— Napsterfounder Sean Parker
— provided the match. IfEisenberg represented
the nerd in high school, Timberlake was the guy
that all the girls wanted. The two characters
complement each other perfectly -— Eisen-

berg’s character comes off as driven, motivated,
and eager to succeed. Timberlake’s, however,
engages in reckless behavior and endangers
the company’s reputation. His promiscuity,
drug use and paranoia prove he’s unreliable
and volatile. Turns out Timberlake has skills
other than dancingin unison, harmonizing and
fending off screaming teenyboppers. ;’
Although the lead actors steal the spotlight,

the unlikely stars of theﬁlm are the supporting .

characters. Hammer shines as the privileged,
arrogant Cameron Winklevoss. Mara’s char-
acter, Erica Albright, represents the people
negatively affected by Zuckerberg’s aspiraI1'ons,_,
Jones plays Marylin Delpy, a law student work-
ing on Zuckerberg’s case, who isn’t afraid to
point out where he went wrong. Finally, Song
sheds her “Disney Channel” image as Christy

Ling, Saverin’s emotionally unstable girlfriend _

and the ﬁlm’s comicrelief.

This weekend, when you’re browsing the"
Internet trying to ﬁnd something to do, go see
“The Social Network,” and learn how it all be-
gan. Bringall your Facebook friends. I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Five-star
recruit Birch
chooses Pitt

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Men’s basketball coach Jamie Dixon
landed his biggest recruit to date last night,
when power forward Khem Birch verbally
committed to the Panthers.

The No. 4 recruit in the class of 2012 ac-
cording to Rivals.com, the 6-foot-8-inch,
18o—pound power forward from Notre Dame
Prep in Fitchburg, Mass., chose Pitt over of-
fers from schools like Arizona, Connecticut,
Ohio State, Texas and West Virginia.

“I chose Pittsburgh because I really feel
comfortable with [assistant] coach [Pat]
Skerry and coach Dixon,” Birch told ESPN. “I
think coach Dixon is a very good coach and
I’m very close with coach Skerry.” ‘

The ﬁve—star recruit is the Panthers’ sec-
ond commitment from the class of 2012.
He joins 6-foot-11-inch New Zealand cen-
ter Steve Adams, who committed on July
6. Adams is ranked as the No. 46 recruit in
the class. I

WOMEN'S SOCCER

 

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

 The Pitt women’s soccer team hopes it can

learn from its past mistakes and capitalize
on scoring chances when it plays Louisville
and Cincinnati this weekend.

“We just need to concentrate a little bit
more and be a little bit better,” Head coach

I Sue-Moy Chin said. “We are creating chanc-

§ es, the goals will come. The quality just needs
to be a little bit better.”

In their last game, the Panthers fell to
West Virginia 3-0. Chin said the Mountain-
eers’ goalkeeper made several quality saves
to keep Pitt from scoring, especially in the

»second half. Pitt sophomore Ashley Cuba

said she was impressed with. her team’s ef-_

fort.
“We played with our hearts and with in-

tensity,” she said. “It just didn’t fall in the
back of the net.”

Chin saw both positives and negatives
in the-loss. *

“We did well playing the ball in the mid-
ﬁeld and connecting with each other in mid-
ﬁeld,” Chin said. “But our service wasn’t
very good. Too many balls were kicked out
of bounds. The quality of our serviceneeds
to be better.” L

But Pitt has been hit by injuries recently.
Chin said senior Liz Carroll didn’t play be-
cause of an injury she sustained on Sunday,
and a few other athletes are out as well. Cuba
said the Panthers are just trying to play to
their strengths. A

“We have a lot of injured people out right
now,” she said. “We just have to keep play-
ing with our hearts and the strengths we
do have.” ;

The Panthers will try to do that when
they take on Louisville and Cincinnati —

two teams Chin described as ‘~‘scrappy on
the attacking end.” V A

“They are both very good teams,” Chin
said. “Louisville is having a good year this
year and Cincinnati is a tough team. They

-work hard, and they work together. They

battle.” V

Louisville is 8-2 on the season and 2-1 in
the Big East, while Cincinnati is,6-4-1 and
0-3 in the Big East. Louisville is currently
in third place in the Big East National Divi-
sion with six points. Cincinnati is last with
zero points. .

Pitt is currently last in the American
Division. -

“They’re both big challenges,” Chin said.
“But I think we match up well.”

Louisville has a few new freshmen, Chin
said, and Christine Exeter — a ﬁrst—year
player from Canada — is particularly dan-
gerous. Exeter leads the Cardinals with six
goals this season. '

‘Panthers looking to capitalize on chances, findfirst conference victory

The Cardinals are coming off a 5-0 loss
to Notre Dame, during which they managed
only four shots.

Redshirt junior Emily Hebbeler — who
has four goals and one assist on the sea-
son —— leads Cincinnati. The Bearcats fell
to DePaul 2-1 in their last game.

Cuba said the Panthers know what to
expect from conference opponents.

“It’s a Big East game, and it’s going to
be a strong game,” Cuba said. “We have to
win to get points and to get somewhere in
the Big East.”

In order to pick up their ﬁrst conference
win, Chin said the Panthers simply have to
play better. ' _

“We just have to be better, the quality has
to be better,” she said. “We had too many
unforced errors —— like the ball going out
of bounds and turning the ball over. We
need to regroup and head to Louisville and
Cincinnati.” I. _ . ‘ ‘

FAMILY EDUCATlONALRlGHTS AND  
PRIVACY ACT (F ERPA)

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their edu-
cation records: These rights include: _ '

- The right to inspect and review the students education records within 45 days of the day the University receives
a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other

. appropriate program director, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect The University oth-

cial will make arrangements for access and notify the students of the time and place where the records may be in-
spected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that offi-
cial shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.

- The right to request the amendment of the students education records that the student believes is inaccurate.
Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is in a curate. They should write the Univer-
sity oiflcial responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it
is inaccurate.

lf the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student
of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Addi-
tional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a
hearing and is available at UP Policy and Procedure O9-08-Ol.

- The right to consent to disclosures of personally identiﬁable infomtation contained in the student's

ees; or a student serving on an cfticial committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisong an 5

other school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the oth-
cial needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the
University will disclose education records without consent to otticials of another school in which a student seeks or
intends to enroll. The University will forward records on request of another school. '
