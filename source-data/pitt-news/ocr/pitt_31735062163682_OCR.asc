Tax Deduction

Not Upset By,Defeat_ Of Bill

\By NANCY 1)ELANEY A " . -
The proposal to provide tax relief for families -sending students

45 to~48. .. _ .
If the bill had passed, some needy students at the University
would probably have beneﬁtte.d, according to Jack Critchﬁeld, Direc-
tor of Student Aid,-. Critchﬁeld indicated, however, that he is “not at all
upset” by the defeat of the propos_al. ' _ . A. M
“It had a numberof drawbacks,” he explained, “and I think the
fact of its defeat will eventually lead to the passage of a more com-
prehensive solution.” ' - '
' Senator Ribicoft‘ Proposed Credit
_ Senator Abraham Ribicoff, Connecticut Democrat, had proposed
the motion as an amendment to the tax, cut bill now before the
Senate. . I _ .

It would have provided tax credit for the first $1500 of a
‘college student's expenses, including tuition, books, and supplies;
but it would also have resulted in a government revenue loss of
an estimated 750 million dollars the first year, rising to one
‘billion, 300 million dollars annually by 1970.

This loss of revenue, coupled with the beneﬁts it wouldpprovide
for those who do not really need help, is one of the three reasons

 

Himes, Koury Bag,
Top IF C Positions

Norman Himes has been elected president of the Inter
Fraternity Council for 1964-65. In a zealously fought cam-
paign, Jack _Koury who ran for the presidency took the
second spot by a vote’ of acclamation after he lost to Himes.

Jim Mastria, Jerry ‘Wische and Rick ‘Snyder captured

' the positions of treasurer, secre-

tary, and the ﬁfth man.

Said Parker Enwright, assistant
dean of men and fraternity ad-
visor, “This is the hardestfought
IFC election I have seen.”

Himes in his campaign speech
stressed “cooperation.” He quoted
from Monday’s Pitt News editorial
and said that he would eliminate
the petty differences that exist
within "the Greek system that
makes it weak.

Similar Sentiments

Koury, who spoke prior to
Himes, expressed similar senti-
ments. He also outlined a four
point program to make IFC more

. efﬁcient. ’‘

'First, standardize and abbre-
viat rush rules. This would
eliminate periodical drafting of
new rules. They would be sub-
ject to change when necessary
and make the ‘thou shall not’
clause for rushees and fraterni-
ties easier to adhere to.

Secondly, it would be mandi-
tory for all committee chairmen
to attend all IFC meetings there-
by facilitating delivery of progress
reports and query sessions.

Thirdly, approach the Dean of
Men’s olﬁce in proper time and
manner to release the prospective
freshmen list to IFC for a more
effective summer rush program.

Finally, since a positive state-
ment has been made by the ad-
ministration concerning .a frater-
nity row, he proposed a closer
laison between administration and

h.i$.[.c

Critchﬁeld gave for his lack of support for the amendment.

“A greatnumber of those who would have received credit would
be from an upper income level, and these: people can afford -college
expenses without assistance,” he explained.

_ Need Different Plan ’ . *

Secondly, Critchﬁeld pointed out the need for a plan to help the
really needy student. The maximum of $325 a year which the de-
feated amendment would have provided ‘is rarely the difference be-
tween whether a student can attend college or not, ‘he indicated.

Most people who can aiford college all except for about
$300 can usually get the rest of the money through jobs, loans,‘
or scholarships. The national concern, Critchﬁeld feels, should
be with those students whose yearlyneed for assistance in order
to attend college is in excess. of $1000. '

' “Of course, there are two sides,”Vhe added. “It’s certainly easier
to get $700 than $1000; but the real need is for a plan to help these.
students who‘wou1dn’t normally get to college at all.”

Discusses ‘Staging

T Met Set Director

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

If you are not bothered by a
speaker who never gets around to
his subject — inthis case “Opera-
Why?” —— then you probably en-
.joyed' the Wednesday Midday
Series lecture of Metropolitan

I "Opera stage director Dr. Herbert

Graf. V V
Dr. Graf, instead of dgscribing
the state ofopera today or“ analyz-

I . ing modern innovations in that art

form, devoted most of his scant

« ﬁfty—minutes to an audio-visual

description of the development of
the opera house and methods of
‘staging operas. ' ‘
Using slides, Dr. Graf compared
th e ipre-Wagnerian, column-ﬁlled
opera houses—ornamented, pom-
pous — to the proposed Metropoli-
tan Opera House to be constructed
in New York’s Lincoln Center for
the Performing Arts., The new

-1/let will feature a stage area that
" is larger than the space ’for the
_' audience. ‘ .

For Social Standing A

‘/‘Opera houses were separated'
V‘ into -levels for social require-
-ments,’’ said Dr. Graf, who has

staged operas in all the major
opera houses in “the world. He
showed slides of tiered, column-
obstructed houses. “But Wagner-
the ﬁrst great opera producer -
revolted and wanted nothing to

' obstruct the audience’s vision. He

lowered the orchestra from view
so as not to distract the people,”

“Wagner was the first to use
moving scenery,” said K)r.~ Graf.
“He used the movie technique—
pulling scenery across the stage;

but it turned out to be too _,

clumsy.”

In between his comments on the 4

made scime telling observations on

the supposed growth of the opera ‘

movement in this country “There

V are now 240 opera -workshops in

existence here,” he said. “Every-

interest in music in general.
