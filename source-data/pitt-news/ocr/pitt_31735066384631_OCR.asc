New By-Laws Efficient?

SGB Differs On Views

By BOB LABRIOLOA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Nearly one month after the Student Government Board approved
a new set of by-laws, the question remains as to whether the change will
heighten the efficiency of the governing body.

According to SGB president Josh Baylson, the primary function of the
new by-laws is to clearly deﬁne the functions of the president and the
board members.

“The new by-laws break down responsibilities among different
people,” said Baylson. “The- way, when someone wants to initiate a
project, we know exactly who to send him to for background information
and which vice-chancellor he will be dealing with.”

Former SGB president Bernie Payne believes the new by-laws are
simply a written version of wh-at had been done in the past through
interpretation.

“The new by-laws are concrete versions of things I was able to
enact last year through interpretation of the constitution,” Payne said.

Board member Dave Hesidence also sees a more structured
government resulting from the changes.

“The by-laws serve as a written reference for powers that the
president always had,” said Hesidence. “Last year, there was no
conception of what exactly was the president’s role, and so when he was
questioned on a particular point, he had no reference point to defend
himself.”

Although the by-laws may explain the powers of the seven members,
there is still no provision included to penalize incompetent board
members.

“The president needs more authority,” said Payne. “As the system
stands now, if people want to follow, that is fine, but if they don’t, that is
ﬁne too according to the by-laws.”

Baylson also sees a need for a means of enforcement.

“The president has no sanctioning power over the board,” said
Baylson. “The president is an authoritarian ﬁgure, but since there is no
system of penalizing incompetency, personalities become involved.”

Board member Bernie Popko expressed fear that a sanctioning
process could be used as a political tool by the president to insure a
“favorable” vote.

‘ ‘I agree with no sanctions,” Popko said. ‘ ‘On the original draft of the
by-laws, the president had the power to punish a board member and
suspend his voting priviledges for 14 days. Since there was no appeal
process, a president could suspend and member who didn’t agree with
him before a critical vote.”

On the other hand, Hesidence, who has been a member of the board
for two years, sees a deﬁnite need for a formal sanctioning procedure.

“Since I’ve been involved in student government, there have been
people who didn’t belong and hampered the functioning of the board,”
Hesidence said. “If one board member gets antagonistic, he can drag
the whole board down with him.”

Popko countered that a penalty process would admit a father-child
relationship between the president and the board.

“The president should be capable enough to persuade the board
members to see his way and do their job without a big-stick approach,”
Popko said.

There was ‘agreement among the members that the present
constitution needs revision, and Hesidence indicated that a revised one
might be forthcoming by November.

' .“If we had something by the time the students came back in
September,’ ’ Hesidence explained, ‘ ‘we could put it through the proper
channels after a six- to- eight week publicity period. The constitution as

WPGH Radio   

Turns Itself
Off the Air

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

WPGH radio, Pitt's student-
operated station, has left the air
temporarily because of technical
difficulties.

According to general manager
Jeff Couch, recent problems with
the station’s carrier-current system
led to the shutdown.

“When Itook ofﬁce (March 15) I
became aware of defects in the
system,” Couch said. ‘‘It was my
understanding that it had not been
in top condition for some time.”

With the carrier-current, the
station’s signal is transmitted
through electrical outlets by lines
from the station’s location in the
Student Union to the Towers and
the Quad.

‘ ‘Right now our system is in very
bad shape,” Couch said. “For the
remainder of the term there is the

chance we will only be able to reach .

the Towers.”
Couch said that due to defects in
the line, some “leakage” had

occured, causing limited open-air
broadcasting. WPGH does not have
an open-air license, and under FCC

Martinique Unique to Pitt Grant Recipient

By J ONI HOMER

Martinique, the small French
island, is considered by most a
resort area—a place at which to
escape the crowded city, and just
lay on the beach, soaking in
Caribbean sun.

To Martha Morrison Baudet,
however, the island will serve
another purpose.

Martinique will provide Baudet,
a Pitt doctoral student, the perfect
cultural setting in which to write
her _doctoral dissertation, “Gram-
matical Origins of Martinican
Creole,” which aims to explore the
Martinique language and its origin.

The opportunity for Baudet to
travel to Martinique, and gain first

hand knowledge of the topic was
extended by The Institute of
International Education-, which
awarded her a Fulbright-Hays
grant.

TheFulbright-Hays grants are
made available each year to
Americanstidemts amd artosts

American students and artists
under programs sponsored by
foreign governments, universities
and private donors. The programs’
purpose is to increase mutual
understanding between the people
of the United States and other
countries throughthe exchange of
citizens, knowledge and skills.
Baudet’s grant is the result of a
mutual exchange between the

United States and France. This
year, the French government made
available a total of 40 grants, an
equal amount of which were
available to males and females.
Thirty-nine of the grants were
given for teaching assistantships in
continental France, and only one
was given for an assistantship in
the French province of Martinique.
Baudet applied for, and was
awarded the French Government
Teaching assistantship on the
ique, considered to the most
prestigious of the grants.
Baudet’s reasons for applying for
a teaching Assistantship on the
French island centered on her
interest in the French language and

NEW YORK—-It will cost an average of six
percent more to go to college next year than it
does this year, says a new study which shows
that a resident student at a private, four-year
college will spend more than $5,000 in the
academic year starting in September.

That $5,000 is equivalent to about one-third
the median family income in the United States.
And it means that even if there is no further
inﬂation——and that is not likely——a freshman
who enters a private school this fall and lives on
campus will have to pay more than $20,000 for
a college education.

The study, released yesterday, was
conducted by the College Scholarship Service
of the College Board, a nonproﬁt organization
of schools, educational ‘associations and

scholarship agencies. Theﬁndings were based

on reports from 2,693 and

universities.

colleges

Costs vary according to the type of
institution involved and such factors as
whether a student commutes or lives on
campus. .

The board study showed, for example, that
1978-79 school expenses for a commuting
student at a public, four-year college will total
$2,604, up 4.8 percent from this year. A
student at the same school who lives on campus
will spend 53,054, up 5.3 percent from this
year.

Other ﬁndings of the study include:

—Expenses at private, four-year colleges
will average $5,110 for on-campus students, up
6.1 percent from this year, and $4,577 for
commuters, up 5.7 percent.

—There will be $12.3 billion in public and

private financial aid for students during the
coming academic year. That does not count
possible beneﬁts from congressional and
administration proposals to help middle-
igiflome families burdened by high education
1 s.

——Tuition and fees are the items which vary
most from school to school. At private,
four-year colleges, tuition and fees will
average $2,647 next year; at public, four-year
schools, the average is $651 although costs can
increase sharply for out-of-state students.

—Dollar amounts for items other than
tuition and fees are fairly similar from one
college to another. As an average, the College
Board says students should plan on $245 for
transportation, $210 for book and supplies,
$470 for personal expenses and either $890 or
$1,440 for room and board, depending on
whether they live home or on campus.

a greater enthusiasm for the
French creole languages, one of
which is spoken in Martinique.

. After receiving her Bachelor of
Arts degree in philosophy from
Mary Washington College of the
University of Virginia, Baudet went
to France, and enrolled, as a
full-time student at the University
of Paris VII.

“Since I had studied French
since the age of 10, and was
particularly interested in French
culture, the trip afforded me the
opportunity to further my pro-
ﬁciency in the language, and to
deepen my understanding of
French civilization,” Baudet said.

Baudet said she then worked
full-time with Rhone-Poulenc,
teaching ﬁve courses and develop-
ing the English program there.

said, “and this period was a
catalyst in my subsequent decision
to return to the United States to
become a graduate student in
linguistics and a teaching assistant
in the English Language Institute
at the University of Pittsburgh.”

While studying linguistics at
Pitt, Baudet’s interest in creole
linguistics and in creole-speaking
communities grew, leading to the
topic she chose for her Master
thesis. ‘ .

“My Master of Arts research
centered on the question of
linguistic origins of the Caribbean
creoles,” said Baudet, “and my
thesis involved the collection and
analysis of data from native
speakers of Haitian Creole and of
Ewe, Yoruba and Igbo. The Ewe,

of colonization and, as my thesis
argues, are among those languages

which contributed most to the
creoles’ grammatical structures.”

Being very interested in studying
the Caribbean creole languages,
Baudet be1ieved‘Martinique would
be an ideal‘ site for furthering her
research and for writing her
doctoral thesis.

“Not only do I want to expand
the results of my Master of Arts
thesis by eliciting data from
Caribbean creole speakers not
accessible in the United States,”
said Baudet, “but I also hope to
provide a detailed grammatical
description of a creole whose

rules, must rely only on carrier-
current broadcasting.

“We are going to request funds
from the Student Government
Board to get back on a proper
carrier-current.’? Couch said. He
added that open-air violations could
result in FCC sanction of up to
$10,000 in ﬁnes and possible
suspension.

According to station engineer
Ken Pierrehumbert, WPGH has
only two operational transmitters,
and needs at least six to effectively
reach the Towers, the. Quad and
Iothrop Hall.

“There should be a transmitter
for each building in order to set up
good reception,” Pierrehumbert
said.

Couch said he expects the station
to begin broadcasting to the Towers
by the end of the week.

“Late this week or early next
week we will be back on the air but
will only be received by a portion of
the students,” Couch said.

He added that WPGH’s chances
for beginning open-air operation
hinges on an effective carrier-
current system.

“Right now we are preparing to
get an open air license,” he said.
“In order to obtain that license we
will have to operate effectively on
carrier-current. If we can get the
money from student government and
a frequency is found we can go open
air.’’

Couch said the open-air process
would take between one to two
years.

“You are the best in a variety of
ways,” Posvar addressed the
students. “You are a very special
source of pride to the University.
Each of you represents a distinction
of excellence, which ODK repre-
sents.”

Jerry Magone, a pre-med major,
was chosen ODK senior of the year.

New officers for the coming year

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Death of a Hotel

When the last elderly resident of Webster Hall Hotel walked
through the front doors of her residence of 35 years, an Oakland
tradition died. Webster Hall, the last vestige of a time when
Oakland was an entertainment and cultural center for the
Pittsburgh area, survived other landmarks—Forbes Field and
Duquesne Gardens by only a few years.

Full-service hotels where a bellman carries your bags, and service
is only a phone call away, are almost extinct in this country. These
amenities once expected are now considered luxuries, and as a
result, archaic institutions such as the Webster collapse.

The hotel’s faithful employees suffer most from the closing.
Now forced into a tight job market, these employees face hard
times finding work, having no wanted skill and lacking the youth

demanded by many employers.

Oakland suffers also from the loss of this landmark. No longer
will Oakland be able to claim a hotel where such celebrities as
Gregory Peck, Bette Davis and Dizzy Gillespie once stayed. Hardly
compensating the loss of a renovated building containing luxury

apartments.

Another luxury apartment building is probably the last thing
needed in the area. Such apartments already abound in Oakland,
but since they insure landlords a healthy profit, owners are always

willing to build a few more.

Apartments with rents students and average wage earners can af-
ford are what isneeded in the Oakland area, but profits from such
apartments are not enough to encourage developers to invest in
such projects. Until the state or federal Government develops
workable programs to encourage investors to build moderately

priced apartments, the housing
other urban areas will persist.

shortage in Oakland and many

Special tax credits for investors building moderately priced
apartments might be one solution to the housing problem. In-
clusion of such tax credits in Carter’s urban policy proposals could
prove a blessing to those Pitt students faced with the frustrating
task of finding an affordable and liveable apartment near the

campus.

In response to the letter
published several weeks ago
criticizing the commuters’ life-
styles at Pitt, (or the Gospel
according to PAT), I feel the
residents have a right for a
representation of their idea of the
“better life.” Therefore, I yield the
following letter (with my interpre-

tations) from an old high school

buddy who opted to leave home
sweet home for dorm sweet dorm!
Hey Gary, '

How are ya? I hope things are
going as well for you as they are for
me...(with the exception of the last
three chem tests I ﬂunked).
Northern Illinois is so beautiful this
time of year...wish you were here.
The weather’s great! (It better be.

since I can’t shut my darn window
completely). Living on campus is so
much fun. You don’t know what
you're missing.

My roommate was a little wierd
at ﬁrst, but he’s O.K. now. (He still
hates to party!) He has octophonic
speakers that reach to the ceiling
and one great turntable, but he
never plays any Ronstadt or Midler
(I guess he doesn’t buy an album
just for the covers). He bugs me
though, because he plays classical
music 32 hours a day (and I’m
really sick of those BeeGees)

As for the food, it really
surprised me up here, it's edible.
Ha! Ha! (The Jello still wiggles
after two and a half weeks). What I
would really like to have is a Burger

Chef so close like Pitt does, Gary.
Oh wow! I really feel so
independent up here... I even do
my own laundry and everything.
(My $38 Levi’s look better with
white splotches, anyway). But most
of all, I love my freetime—between
c1asses——when I can go back to my
room to sleep or Whatever! (or to
waste my very limited allowance on
pinball, like I usually do). Well,
GT, maybe someday you’ll get a
chance to live like a king (or) like
me. Ha! Ha! (Boo! Hool).

Your buddy

Bobby Kenn edy: Last of the Liberal Leadership

By R. DAVID TIVE

(Editor's Note: This is the third in a
series of columns about the events of
1968, their impact at that time, and their
repercussions on America today. The
first two articles dealt with the early
success of Eugene McCarthy ’s presiden-
tial campaign and the assassination of

Martin Luther King.)

Most people can remember
exactly where they were and what
they-were doing when they first
heard about the shooting of John
Kennedy. The impact of that event
was such that the moment
imprinted itself in the minds of
everyone who experienced it.

The same holds true for the
assassination of JFK’s brother,

Robert Kennedy. Although Bobby
was not President, his murder,
coming as it did so soon after that
of Martin Luther King, and with its

obvious relation to the murder of

JFK, produced a national trauma
which has altered our country in
several ways.

There is a direct link between the
murder of Bobby Kennedy and the
two events of 1968 already
discussed in this series. If Gene
McCarthy had not succeeded in
forcing Lyndon Johnson to with-
draw from the presidential cam-
paign, it is highly unlikely that
Kennedy would have entered, and
he probably would not have been
killed. The assassination of Martin
Luther King got the country

thinking about assassinations, and
started a snowball effect that
claimed Kennedy as its next victim.
This snowball effect could be seen
again in 1975 in the pathetic
attempts on the life of President
Ford.

The impact of Bobby Kennedy’s
murder at that time is hard to
gauge. It was the second assassina-
tion of a major national political

THOUGHTS AND
REFLECTIONS

ﬁgure in less than three months,
and our emotions were still numb.
It did have the effect of beginning a
self-examination of ourselves as a
people.

We began asking questions like
“Are we naturally prone to
violence?” and “What is it about
us that makes us kill off those who
are best able to help us, and who
represent all that we hope our
country stands for?’ The debates
over these and similiar issues went
on for a long time, but no
conclusions were ever reached. It is
doubtful whether there are an-
swers, and if there are, do we really
want to hear them?

There was one beneﬁcial and
almost immediate result of the
two murders. The only legislation
ever enacted on a nationwide basis
that even begins to control ﬁrearms
came about as a direct result of the
Kennedy and King shootings. It
was, and still is, far from enough,
but the fact ‘that it was passed

shows how seriously the American
people took the problem.

The effect on nationalipolitics at
the time was also drastic. By the
time of the Kennedy murder, it had
become clear that Gene McCarthy
was not the Messiah many had
initially thought he was, and was
not the leader we needed to bring
us out of the nightmares of
Vietnam and race riots in the cities.

That mantle fell to Bobby
Kennedy. It seemed to ﬁt him,
partly through his own qualities,
and partly through those of his late
brother, whether real or imagined.

With -Bobby gone, there was no
one to receive the mantle. ‘Certainly
not Hubert Humphrey, who was
then the frontrunner for the
Democratic Presidential nomina-
tion. He was regarded as the
puppet of Lyndon Johnson who
was himself the supreme object of
hatred for the Kennedy and
McCarthy supporters.

And certainly not George McGo-
vern either, the man who tried to
pick up the remnants of the
Kennedy campaign. His time
wouldn’t come for another four
years, at which point it would be
discovered that neither he nor the
moment was right.

In short, there was no one. There
was no one to whom the idealists
could turn. No one to pick up the
tradition of Adlai Stevenson, John
Kennedy, Gene McCarthy and
Bobby Kennedy.

And therein lies the long term

impact of the death of Bobby
Kennedy. With him died the
idealism that had motivated two
generations of Americans, and kept
them plugged into, and operating

through, the political sy-stem. As 

long as there was hope that
someone, like one of the four
mentioned above might be able to
solve the problems the liberal
idealists saw facing this country,
they were eager to be involved.
When that hope was destroyed, so
was their involvement.

Those who held liberal beliefs,
and had seen them espoused by a
continuous stream of capable
leaders since the end of World War
II, then began to doubt there was a
place ' for them anymore in
American politics. Many withdrew
from that ﬁeld, and have not
reemerged yet. Some may have

become involved in the McGovern.

campaign in 1972, but many,
particularly of the older generation,
_did not. To them it was all over or
hopeless. They withdrew, in many
cases, into a self-insulated coccoon.
Many of the younger idealists
were soon to join them in that
coccoon, but being younger, they
had more resilience. They made
one more effort before giving up.
They made one more attempt to
have themselves heard and con-
sidered in the councils of American
politics. They took their issues and
their hopes to the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago in
August, 1968.

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—Planning a $3.5
billion steel mill is no small task, but
U.S. Steel didn’t overlook the little
things when it examined its plans
for a patch of Lake Erie farmland.

Game bird were among the
creatures discussed in a study of the
company’s proposal for a 3,000-acre
lakefront building site near
Conneaut, Ohio.

Woodcocks breed on the fallow
land, and the mill will force them to
move. But they won’t have to go
far. Enough area will be left to
permit continued breeding, the
report says.

The study was needed to show
local, state and federal agencies the
big mill would not harm the
environment in an area where
farming and recreation are big
business.

The study consists of 17 volumes,
each hundreds of page long, and
was written after a year of talks with
agencies that ultimately must rule
on the mill.

“This is absolutely the most
fantastic environmental impact
statement ever made,” said

Stephen P. Curtis, who oversaw the
U.S. Steel project as vice president
of engineering and research.

“It’s required, of course. But it
covers everything.”

The study is geared to a March
1979 construction start, but U.S.
Steel hasn’t said it plans to build. In
fact, it says it must have a
reasonable prospect for proﬁt
before undertaking the project.

That means the company must be

be curbed and that the administra-
tion plans to encourage capital.
investments through faster taxi
writeoffs and other incentives

There are incentives for a quick

decision, however. Inﬂation adds
$200 million to the price each year.

And costs will be higher if the
capital goods market improves
before construction begins.

Curtis said in a recent interview
he believed the schedule could be
met if all non-engineering problems
can be resolved.

“We could start in 1979,’? he
said, adding that no detailed
engineering work has actually
begun. That word would cost about

$200 million, more than the
company is now willing to commit.

It was this cost that led U.S.
Steel, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency and other Federal,
Pennsylvania and Ohio authorities
to collaborate on the study.

The result is a document that
identifies potential problem areas
and prescribes solutions.

One was sulfur oxides, an
emission from coke ovens and other
operation that could form acid rain if
mixed with lake storms. Prevailing’
winds carry the rains over fruit and
vegetable crops, including valuable
vineyards.

The company’s engineers, who
prepared a 13-volume study of
modern steel technology before the
environmental report was begun.
found ways to minimize and
neutralize escaping emissions,
reducting the risks.

“There seem to be no environ-
ment problems that could not be
mitigated,” said Col. Daniel D.
Ludwig, head of the Corps’ Buffalo
District, where the official draft is
being prepared.

Public hearings on the proposal
are expected to begin within two
months, and state officials concede
there probably will be some local
opposition, despite the plant’s
economic advantages for the area.

“The thing that concerns
us most is protracted litiga-
tion that would hold up
the project,” said Martin
Marolis, special assistant to
Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp.

0 Woody Allen Wins Two, "Annie Hall," is Best Film

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pill News Staff Writer
Woody Allen refused to show up
at the 50th academy awards
telecast, but the gifted comedian /
director copped two Oscars of three
nominations—best director and

best screenplay for his semi-auto-
biographical film, “Annie Hall”—
ﬁnishing second only to Richard
Dreyfuss in the best actor category.

“Annie Hall” was a surprise
winner for best picture. Most
people assumed the laurels would

IIIIIs.....lIIL'
_.‘...“‘..    _

The top films of the past year, clockwise from top, are: “The Turning Point,”
“The Goodbye Girl,” “Star Wars,” “Julia,” and “Annie Hall.”

go to that critics’ delight, “The
Turning Point,” or to that triumph
of technology, “Star Wars.” But
the win was an important one, for
“Annie Hall” proved that a ﬁlm
with comedic touches is no
light-weight contender.

The last time a ﬁlmmaker was
nominated in the same categories as
Allen, it was Orson Welles for
“Citizen Kane.” Although now the
ﬁlm is hailed as a milestone, Welles
took home a screenwriting award,
the only Oscar the picture won.
Over the years, apparently Holly-
wood has learned to hail its talented
when they deserve it—at least this
holds true in the case of Allen.

Diane Keaton won best actress in
the toughest ﬁeld of competition in
years—Anne Bancroft, Shirley
MacLaine, Marsha Mason and Jane

Fonda.

Former nominees all, and two
former winners, all had strong
performances. But while some say
Keaton was simply playing herself
.in “Annie Hall,” and others claim
she picked up some votes for her
performance in “Looking for Mr.
Goodbar, ’ ’ the fact remains that she
is a ﬁne actress. Never has she been
better than as “Annie Hall.”

Dreyfuss was an unexpected
winner for best actor. A ﬁrst-time
nominee despite several fine
performances, Dreyfuss was voted
best actor for his performance in
Neil Simon’s “The Goodbye Girl.”
Like Keaton, he has another solid
hit in “Close Encounters of the

Studio Theater Celebrates
With Energetic Musical

By ROB PLOTZ

Celebration P
Directed by Melanie Smith

Eclipses, masks, rituals, politics,
pollution and greed. Put it all to
music and make it dance, and what
do you have? “Celebration.”

“Celebration,” the musical play,
is a mixture of music, symbolism
and allegory that spews many
themes: Love triumphs (though
painfully); greed doesn’t pay; and
people who want to be “some-
body" don’t stand a chance of
becoming anybody are three. All
this comes out of a simplistic
-‘ ‘Everyman’ ’/ ‘ ‘Pippin’ ’-style plot.

Potemkin (Wanda McDaniel), is
in search of his lost garden. The
garden had been appropriated by
Edgar Allen Rich (Charle F.S.
Muscardelli), whom Orphan plans
to meet at Rich’s annual New
Year’s Eve party. There, Orphan
hopes to persuade Rich to return
his Garden, and live happily ever
after.

At Rich’s home, Orphan meets
Angel (Patty Pelcz), a singer with a
rock band, and falls for her. The
conﬂict of the play begins when
Rich also falls for Angel, and
banishes the Orphan from the
party. The play becomes a

tug-of-war between Orphan and_

Rich, symbolizing the war between
the natural and artiﬁcial (Rich
made his ﬁrst million by selling
falsies.). V

McDaniel’s Potemkin is both
energetic and restrained. Despera-
tion cries from her posture,
especially her arms, her elbows
hug her body, her forearms extend
out, her palms point upward,
questioning life.

She has a strong voice, which
lends authority to her role, but her
strength and joy often obscure the
pain she has experienced in the
past. Potemkin’s certain permeat-
ing bitterness shows itself only
intermittently, sometimes dulling

the razor-sharp cynicism of her
speeches.

McWilliams is as endearing as a
wide-eyed Raggedy Andy with
brown curls who is usually getting
sand kicked in his face by symbolic

Theater

bullies. McWilliams is very believ-
able as the harassed optimist. He
also takes advantage of Orphan"s
violent side, making his ﬁght
scene with Rich an intriguing
picture of the ﬁghting paciﬁst. He
sings clearly with a good range,
showing potential as a vocalist.

Pelcz manages to be so
charming through this production
that you don’t want to believe she’d
ever sing with a band whose
members dress like devils, and
crack their whips on cue. Her voice
is sweet and enticing, and though
she sings her rock numbers well,
her character seems more at home
being in love than trying to be
‘ ‘somebody. ’ ’ _

Muscardelli must take credit for
being the raunchiest villian who
ever set foot on the Studio Theatre
stage. His performance as old Rich,
slurping and burping his dinner, is
an hilarious adventure in gourmet
grossness.

Hunched over, with his guts
oozing out over his belt, Muscar-
delli is like an overweight bug in a
black suit coat, eyes raging wide.
He approaches his victims with
short calculated steps, and poisons
them with his ever-burning vitriol.

Some of Muscardelli’s numbers
exceed his vocal range, but that
doesn’t matter; he talks, grumbles,
and growls his way through the
lyrics with a characteristic villainy
that even Fagin might admire.

Rounding out the eccentric cast
of characters are the Revelers, a
group of ﬁve men and ﬁve women
who portray much of man and
womankind, from ﬂower children
to carcatured jet-setters. Their

exuberance lends continuity to the
show, gluing each scene to the
other with an Elmer’s Glue of
craziness.

The book by Tom Jones is more a
revue than a cohesive musical play.
Its storyline and characters reek of
the 1960’s with the themes of
anti-capitalism, anti-establish-
mentism, simple love and peace
wafting through its body. Unfor-
tunately the themes are blatantly
hammered into the audience’s
head, and the melodramatic nature
of the piece seems to constantly
threaten its lighter side.

Director Melanie Smith has
chosen not to tamper with the
material, and embellishes every
situation to the point of making the
show look like an exaggerated
animated cartoon. This approach
provides the audience with a

Camel Hits With"Rain Dances"

By JOE SCHMITT

Raindanees
Camel
Janus

Camel is a ﬁne melodic rock
band, long on talent but undeser-
vedly short on fans. ‘ ‘Raindances, ’ ’
their ﬁfth release overall and fourth
in America, is their best effort to
date and should win them ‘a
respectable position among the
progressive biggies.

This is especially true in light of
some of the more or less

T disappointing “lemon” pies turned

out recently by the likes of
Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Pink
Floyd, Genesis and Yes. On the
strength of “Raindances” Camel
can now claim the status of a
“comer,” along with groups such

Third Kind,” but seven-time
nominee Richard Burton was a
sentimental favorite who Las Vegas
odds makers touted as a sure bet.

Vanessa Redgrave was voted best
supporting actress for the title role
in “Julia,” to the surprise of those
who considered her support for the
Palestinian Libertion Organization
enough to tip the scales in favor of
Tuesday Weld. And Redgrave
managed to squeeze in a short
speech about her cause which was
met ﬁrst with jeers, and later with
rabid applause.

Co-star Jason Robards, who
played Dashiell Hammet in “Julia”
won his second best supporting
actor award in as many year (last
year, Robards won for “All The
President’s Men”). 

“Star Wars” swept the remain-
ing categories for editing, special
effects and musical score. “You
Light Up My Life” was voted best
song. “Close Encounters” and
“Star Wars” each picked up special

awards for sound effects that were
presented by no less than C-3PO,
R2-D2 and Mark Hamill.

The evening’s best moments?
Paul Williams’s snappy comeback
to co-presenter Mickey Mouse, who
was celebrating his ﬁftieth birthday
along with Oscar.

Said Williams to the three-digited
rodent, “You know what we’re
getting you for your birthday? Two
more ﬁngers.” And Bob Hope
giving a get well wish to John
Wayne who had just had open heart
surgery. And a shyly humble John
Travolta thanking the academy for
his nomination before he an-
nounced the nominees for best
supporting actress.

And the worst? The treatment of
the nominated songs. A sore spot to
begin with because the academy
ignored the remarkable Bee Gees’
score from “Saturday Night Fever’ ’
and even former winner David
Gates’s “Goodbye Girl” for some

(Continued on Page 10)

Comedy ﬁlms never win best
picture, so the saying goes, but
“Annie Hall,” a movie by
America’s zaniest innovator
proved the old saw false
Monday night.

Woody Allen is unique in that
his comedic genius has been
honored in his own lifetime:
the Marx Brothers, W.C.
Fields, and Buster Keaton (no
relation to “Annie” star Diane

whose real last name is Hall)
were never even nominated for

Oscars, though Groucho was
honored toward the end of his
life and Charlie Chaplin receiv-
ed an honorary award.

“Annie Hall” is the story
about a dead relationship
between a neurotic writer
(Allen) and a ﬂighty WASP
(Keaton). The plot seems to,
parallel much of what is
publicly known about Allen-.

“Woody had the guts to
make a movie about himself
and his girl and star himself
and his girl,” sniped fellow
director Peter Bogdanovich,
who himself has made movies
about himself and his girl
(Cybill Shepherd) that haven’t
succeeded like “Annie Hall.”

How »much of “Annie” is

really Keaton and how much of
Alvie is actually Allen is
irrelevant, really. What is
important is that the movie was
recognized for being the ﬁne
ﬁlm that it is.

A Very Special Victory

Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. _

as Crack the Sky, Alan Parsons and
Happy the Man.
As long as I’m name-dropping:

regulars Peter Bardens (key-
boards), Andrew Latimer (guitars
and ﬂute), and Andy Ward (drums)
are joined by Mel Collins on saxes,
clarinet and ﬂute. Also, Richard
Sinclair of Hatﬁeld and the North
fame replaces former bassist-
turned-football-player, Doug Fer-
guson (to whom this LP is
dedicated). Last, and certainly
least, on the quiet mood piece
“Elke,” Eno appears, courtesy of
E.G. Records. The‘ resulting
aggregation is pleasantly effective.
Lots of smooth, mellow instrumen-
tation, with an occasional gutty
moog or guitar lead, coupled with a
small dose of jazzy-ness on a few
cuts (most notably on ‘ ‘One of these
Days I'll get an Early Night’ '). Only
four tracks contain vocals, and these

are handled adequately, if uninter-
estingly, by both Latimer and
Sinclair.

For the most part, the Camel
sound is well-integrated and full,
with no one particular player
spotlighted, but each musician
participating equally and comple-
menting the others. While all

members possess above-average’

skill, Peter Bardens excels on
synthesizers and keyboards,
playing some nice stuff and not
prone to showing off.

It could be said that Camel is to
Genesis as Starcastle is to Yes. But
while Starcastle are bubble-gum-
chewing sons of Yes’s Jon
Anderson lacking in integrity,
Camel is not a watered-down
imitation of Genesis, but has a
musical identity of its own. There
are similarities—strong melodies,

style of keyboard playing, “_f1111”
texture—but many more differ-
ences. _

The rhythm back-up for Camel is
not as tight, energetic and
sophisticated as the pairing of Mike
Rutherford and Phil Collins (but
then, very few are). “Raindance,”
unlike previous Camel albums, has
sax playing and some minor horn
backing, along with a correspond-
ingly jazzier feel (‘ ‘Skylines’ ’)- This

gives the LP a diverse style,
graceful and relaxed.

—On this album, no classical
inﬂuences remain, and the title
track is even a bit spacey.

“Tell Me” is a drumless slow
ballad distinguished by some
mournful fretless bass, breathy
vocals and nice ﬂute and clarinet.

“Highways of the Sun” has a
dumb theme and cutey-pie vocals,
but a decent sweeping synthesizer
passage in the middle (much like

\

that which appears on “Moonmad-
ness”) helps to redeem it some-
what. It is the only weak spot on the
album.

The opening track, ‘ ‘First Light, ’ ’
is a brilliant soaring instrumental,
and it indeed presents a strong case
for making comparisons between
Camel and Genesis. And favorable
ones at that, for “Raindances” is a
superb effort from a good band who
deserve better.

"Celebration " A Joyous Play

(Continued from Page 7)
frenzied display of theatrical
gymnastics, but it also tends to
sacrifice the humanity of the
characters; they become mari-
onettes, not people who need love.

Visually, “Celebration” is prac-
tical and unassuming. The set by
Rick Agliette comprises two sets of
platforms on scaffolding at two
corners of the studio. Each are
darkly toned, exuding a simplicity
which is almost Elizabethan.

Audrey Glickman’s light design
is lifewise straightforward, match-
ing the simplicity of Aglietti’s set,
but also providing some unusual

READ

special effects. At the beginning,
for instance, the Revelers gather
round a campfire and sing.
Glickman gives them a few shafts
of orange light, which instantly
becomes a chimney for the fire’s
smoke, as well as suggesting a
dusky twilight.

The costumes, by Gayle Gear-
heart Herring and Lisa Bansavage,
are simple, using black leotards in
most scenes. To suggest ornate
costumes, small pieces are added.
Rarely are the costumes elaborate,
but when they are, they suggest a
realism which clashes with the
fantasy world of the play.

FUZZY WEEKS

 

The key to the play’s visual unity
is its suggestiveness. To enjoy
seeing this show, the spectator
must bring along an imagination.

Imagination. It’s important to
theatre, especially to a show that
contains as much allegory as
“Celebration.” The script’s inces-
sant preaching could possibly
dampen the story’s more imagina-
tive aspects, but not at the Studio.
There, the cast of “Celebration”
puts out so much verve that the
Ghost of the Sixties Past might
never again have its ﬁnal word—or

song.

Payne wees the constitution as a
major hinderance to the governing
efficiency of the president and the
board.

“I don’t think that student
government will be where it should
until the constitution is changed,”
Payne said.

Popko added that he would like to
see a constitutional review
commission established that would
have the option of proposing
amendments to the present consti-
tution or drafting an alternative
document.

Board member Jan Medoff also
sees the Constitution as being too
ambiguous, but believes student
government should not throw up its
hands in defeat over a faulty
document.

“If a board member really wants
to serve the students, he will,”
Mendoff said. “It doesn’t really

Tastes Vary, but the Sl1ow’s Gone to the Dogs

By R. DAVID TIVE

Pill News Staff Writer

Personally, I thought the Irish
setter’s neck was too long. If I’d
been making the choice, I would
have picked the doberman pin-
scher.

The choice, however, was not
mine at the 39th all-breed dog show
and obedience trial of the Western
Pennsylvania Kennel Association

réﬁﬁa

(WPKA) held Saturday at the Civic
‘Arena.

Herman Cox had been brought in
from Fort Worth, Texas, to pick the
best in show. In his judgement, an
Irish setter, Ch. Powderhorn
Yankee Riﬂeman, deserved that
honor.

My mentioning my choice was not
irrelevant or mere egoism; the
activity of dog show judging is very
subjective. It is truly a case of

Out of the action, this Italian greyhound relaxes before showtime.

beauty being in the eye of the
beholder. When Cox decided that
the setter would win out over the
other ﬁve dogs in the final round—a
doberman pinscher, a whippet, a
maltese, a miniature schnauzer and
a Boston terrier—he wasn't saying
that the setter was a better dog than
the others, merely that it was a
better Irish setter than they were a
doberman, whippet, and so on.

Each breed of dog has had_

standards set for it by the American
Kennel Club. In a show, it is a
judge’sjob to pick the dog that most
closely meets the standards set for
its breed. Cox’s decision therefore
meant that the setter more closely
met its standards than the
doberman and the others met
theirs. But since the standards are
not specific and detailed, there can
be some disagreement. Thus my
perfectly valid opinion that the
setter’s neck was too long.

This fluctuation can also be
shown in the judging of the
dachshunds. In a show on Friday
open only to dachshunds, and
sponsored by the Greater Pitts-
burgh Specialities, there was a
different judge than there was the
next day at the WPKA all-breed
show. As a result, there were
different winners in the elimina-
tions leading to the selection of the
best smooth and best wirehaired
dachshund. But the standards do
provide for some consistency, as the
same dogs won on both Friday and
Saturday in both dachshund breeds.

The process of getting down to
the final six dogs for Cox to choose

among was a long and difﬁcult
one. Over 2,200 dogs from 117
different breeds were judged. All
the breeds are placed into one of six
varieties according to the nature
and history of the breed. The

winners of each of the six varieties
then compete for the best in show.
While all this is going on, six
different classes of obedience are
also being judged.

Jason’s Golden Shadow, a Golden retriever, takes to the hurdles at the dog

show last weekend.

The WPKA show is like a 16-ring
circus. But if you are a dog fancier
who wants to learn more, or just
someone who wants to buy a dog but
doesn’t know what breed, there is
no better way to do it than to go to
the dog show. Watch the judges,
learn what other people think is
good in a dog, and make up your
own mind as to whether or not you
agree with them.

Mabou Mines’ “B. Beaver” Stutters into Pittsburgh

By MICHAEL X. ZELENAK

For the next three nights
Pittsburgh audiences will have a
chance to see one of the country’s
most celebrated dramatic compan-
ies, Mabou Mines. They will be
performing one of their major
works, “B Beaver Animation ” at
the Stephen Foster Memorial
Theater. The performances are the
highlight of the 99 Cent Floating
theater’s 1978 Season.

Mabou Mines, founded in 1970,
is a company of international
reputation. They have performed in
every major American city from Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and
Chicago to ‘Philadelphia, Washing-
ton, Boston and, of course, New
York, their home. They have also
performed widely abroad, in Berlin,
Amsterdam, Florence and other
European cities.

As a prelude to their Pittsburgh
premiere, Ruth Maleczech, an
actress and one of the ‘original
founders of Mabou Mines, discuss-
ed the play and the company.

“Actually, Beaver is the name of
a character,” Maleczech said. “He
is a beaver, but he has a special
problem. He has lost the art of
‘damnation’—-he can no longer
build dams. He sees the ﬂoods are
coming, and his last dam is ready to
break. He knows all is lost unless he
gets an idea. The play is about
getting an idea—that is, the
problem of thinking. There is a lot of
verbal humor and puns.”

Maleczech, a product of UCLA
and the. San Francisco Actors’
Workshop, came to New York from
Paris, where she had met and
worked with the artists who founded
the Mabou Mines com-
pany eight years ago.

“The play is a narrative—it tells a
story. There are ﬁve actors, but only
Beaver speaks. It is a sort of ‘choral
monologue.’ The other four actors

aspect of Beaver. They are very
stereotyped, but they are also very
kinky. The audience has no trouble
recognizing that they are all

ﬁgments of our shared imagina-

tions.”

Since 1975, Mabou Mines has
been honored with ﬁve OBIE
Awards, including Best Production

(1977 for “Dressed Like An Egg”),
Best Direction (1976, JoAnne
Akalaitis, for ‘ ‘CaSCaI1d0' ’)and Best
Performance (1976, David Warrilow
in “The Lost Ones”). “B Beaver
Animation” by Lee Brever is the
middle work from their trilogy,
which also includes “The Shaggy
Dog Animation” and “The Red

Horse.” “The Shaggy Dog
Animation” opens next month in
New York City at Joe Papp’s New
York Public Theater for a five-week
run.

“The play (“B Beaver”) is a
comedy. It is really an irresistably
warm sort of comedy,” she
explained. “Audiences every-

where have enjoyed it. In FlorencL.:i :

even though we performed it in
English, they loved it. Fred
Neumann, who plays the Beaver, is
a magnetic ‘mucho-macho’ ﬁgure.
He has a lot of ‘male problems.’ He
is a patriarch. He has family
responsibilities; he is a recogniz-
able social type. That’s why so
many different kinds of people can
relate to him, even though he can’t
think his way out of a paper bag, or
a piece of plywood, in his case.
Beaver is in the classic tradition of
the anti-hero. He is trapped by his
dam, his paranoias, his hangups.

“All the costumes are different
types of robes, a kimona, Indian
dodi, raincoat, smoking jacket 1 1
bed jacket. We rejected the idea’ of
using skins or furs. Even the curtain
is made of bath robes sewn
together. The curtain itself moves
and gestures.

“The stage is on a fulcrum. It also
moves. The lighting is provided by
four slide projectors which isolate
the action into little squares. The
effect is very similar to a comic
strip.

The Pitt AAU swim team heads to
Austin today in preparation for this
weekend’s AAU national swimming
championships at the University of
Texas.

Pitt varsity swimmers making the
trip include . Kathy Stetler, who
recently became the ﬁrst national
champion in the history of women’s
swimming at Pitt, Mark Schuman,
Suzanne Pulley and Bob Clemmer.

High school swimmers Jan
Ujevich (Center High School), Sue
Elliott (North Hills), and Laura

.0 Barber (North Allegheny) will also

compete for Pitt.

“We take a group to the ﬁnals
each year,” explained coach Dick
Bradshaw, who started the AAU
program at Pitt ﬁve years ago. “In
the past few years, we have had
strong showings from our women’s
teams. They've consistently placed
among the top ten.”

“Our men's teams haven’t been
as strong,” Bradshaw continued.
“With Schuman and Clemmer, we
think our men can be well-repres-
ented also. In fact we could be
among the top ten ﬁnishers in the
combined (men and women)
standings. ’ ’

Leading Pitt will be Stetler and
Ujevich, who will compete in ﬁve

Sports

individual events and two relays
apiece.

Stetler and Ujevich, a high school
all-America from Aliquippa, have
made all-America in their respec-
tive events.

Bradshaw thinks they should do
the same again this year.

The Pitt tennis team, whose
match against Penn State tomorrow
represents the ﬁnest competition
the Panthers will face this season,

Morris, 9-0, under the rain-pattered
roof of Moon Township’s Airport

is the team on the other side of the
net. One of the ﬁnest squads in the
East, the Lions have made a habit in
the recent past of shutting out
Panther opponents.

“They beat us, 9-0, the last 10
years,” Dieffenbach said.

The Pitt coach, though certainly
aware of the Nitts’ capabilities, isn’t
about to hang crepe, however.

singles confrontation, which Pitt’s

(number four) Brand won 6-0, 2-6,
6-2.

“Brand just lost concentration in
the set he dropped,” Dieffenbach
said. “He came back nice, and won
the third set, though.”

In other action, Tom Liebenguth
had slight trouble, but managed to
emerge a 7-6, 6-2 victor over Robert

Kathy, well, what can I say about
Kathy,” the Panther swim coach
said. “She was a seven-time
all-America at the AIAW Nationals
this year, and she had that great
performance in the Easterns (ﬁve
meet records). Both look strong
heading into this, meet, too.”
Bradshaw also expects (strong
showings from Pulley (400-yard
freestyle, 400-yard medley and
800-yardfreestyle relays), Schuman
(100-yard butterﬂy and 100-yard
freestyle), Clemmer (200-yard
breastroke), Elliott (400 and
800-yard freestyle relays), and

Barber (100 and 200-yard back-
stroke).

Pitt Sends Four Swimmers to Austin for AAU Meet

Pulley made all-America this year
in both the 200 and 400-yard
freestyle relays.

Schuman, on the other hand,
missed out on similar recognition in
last week’s NCAA swimming and
diving championships at Long
Beach, California. With the top
twelve finishers earning all-
America status, the junior placed
13th in the 100-yard butterﬂy.

SWIM SHORTS: It will be
Clemmer’s, Pulley’s and Schu-
man’s debut in representing Pitt at
the meet. Schuman (Philadelphia)
and Pulley (Richmond, Va.) have
competed in the nationals for other
AAU teams.

macqllet C1Ub- ‘ ‘We plan to make it a little closer

The 5-2 Panthers, who lost but a
single set," needed only three hours
to send the Colonials home losers
for the second time in as many
matches for them.

The Panther win improved on last
year’s double drubbing of the
Colonials, who then provided
slightly stronger competition in 5-4
and 6-3 encounters. The difference
between this year and last, since
both squads used many of the same
players, was easily explained.

“We just had more confidence,”
said Pitt coach George Dieffenbach.

“Conﬁdence because of our
southern trip early in the season.
We had six matches already under
our belt going into the Robert
Morris match, and they had only
played one.”

That conﬁdence enabled the,

Panthers to cruise, a luxury they
won’t be afforded when Penn State

this year,” he said of the match,
which is scheduled to start at 2:30
p.m. tomorrow on the potholed
Trees Courts. “Fans are going to
have a chance to see some fine
tennis.”

Fans could also possibly see a
different Pitt lineup tomorrow,
before which Dieffenbach will hold
intrasquad challenge matches for
those Panthers not previously on
the starting roster.

But Monday, Pitt made do with
the same lineup it has used
throughout most of this season,
with the exception of the number-
three doubles combination. Tom
Kepner and Joe Mayers took control
of that designation by easily
handling Tom Byrne and Walker
Kelly, 6-3, 6-2.

The two-set victory for Kepner-
Mayers mirrored seven other
matches, the lone three-set contest

Morris’s Chip Dean in number-one
singles play.

The Panthers’ Bill Pilardi lost
only-two games in beating Fred
Yost, 6-2, 6-0 in the number-two
spot, while teammate Kevin Quay
(number three) beat Dan Casey,
6-2, 7-5.

The number-ﬁve singles match
had Pitt’s Tom Gault smash Byrne,
6-1, 6-0, and George Hoffman

rounded out the singles action with »

a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Kelly.
Beside the Kepner-Mayers doubles
win, Pitt’s Liebenguth and Pilardy
beat Dean and Yost, 6-2, 6-3, and
the Casey-Starr combination fell to
Panthers Quay and Gault, 6-4, 6-2.

That all contributed to an easy
primer for Thursday when the
Panthers will try their luck against
PSU’s Mark Darby, Tim McAvoy
and Bill Schmucker, all unfamiliar
names, but extraordinary tennis
talents.

George Hoffman sets to receive a serve.

It’s spring at Pitt Stadium, and that means Jackie
Sherrill’s thoughts have turned toward...well, he’s
married, so they’ve turned toward football.

And even yesterday, when large puddles outnum-

"  football players at the Stadium, and it seemed

i “ it

. "4 e as many Panthers were in hospital gowns as were
in shoulderpads and sweats, Sherrill’s optimism was
unbridled.

“I think we’re going to have a good football
team,” he said between glances at an injured list that
has reached double digits. “We’ll have size...good
size. . .plus speed at the skill positions.”

Few spots in the Panther lineup are secure in the
mind of Sherrill, who likes to experiment in much the
same way Pitt likes to collect tuition. At this time last
year, when things were becoming dull at the Stadium,

v Sherrill invited any and every able-bodied male on

3. ampus -to football tryouts. That idea has lost its

' nvelty, -so Sherrill has declared open season on far
more than half the starting positions. ,-
Therein may lie the reason for the many injuries.

“Hell,” said one Panther. -“Spring ‘ball is sup-

posed to be a little bit of running and a lot of

watching the weather get warm. But this year, man,
people are working. They’re putting out. And that’s
a damn shame, since I personally enjoy watching the
weather get warm.”

Several Panthers aren’t working; they’re too busy
healing. Hugh Green’s bad knee put him in the
hospital. Mike Balzer, an important part of Pitt’s
1978 secondary, joined Green after tearing a

V-: 'gament. Defensive lineman Bob Gruber has a bum

nee, Artrell Hawkins has a broken ankle, Terry

McEwen has torn ligaments and Scott McKeel has
also injured an ankle.

But, as Sherrill reminds, “they’ll all be back.”

xvww¢w¢w¢¢¢w¢w¢¢w7C¢wv¢¢w

And the Pitt coach has a good idea of what each can
do. The biggest question surrounding Pitt’s next
football season—topping such problems as how will

 

Pitt get the ball to Gordon Jones, how often will Pitt
use two tight ends and how short does Pitt dare go
with Sue Murphy’s uniform—rests on the shoulders
of Rick Trocano, Lindsay Delaney and Scott Jenner.
“We’re going to have a quarterback,” said
Sherrill, reassuring any fans who feared Pitt might
switch to a single wing. “Those guys can play.”

Play, perhaps. But can they throw? Trocano came
to Pitt with a reputation as a thrower; he enters this
season with a reputation as someone who needs
work. Lindsay Delaney is placed behind Trocano on
Pitt’s most recent depth chart and Scott Jen-
ner...well, Jackie Sherrill never has seen him throw a
football. (“I’ve seen him on films, though,” he
assures.)

Right behind the quarterbacks are the running
backs, where Sherrill finds not so much a problem,
but a matter of selection.

“We’ve got a whole stable of pony backs,” he
said, visions of ‘Freddie Jacobs, Larry Sims, Rooster
Jones, Steve Harris and Artrell Hawkins dancing

._-.. . . . . . . . . _ . . . . ' . . _ . . . . . . . . . r c ca

  Spring a the Stadium: Rain Today, but Fall Fost Is Good

across the goal-lines of his mind. “We’ll be all right
there. And we have some size in our freshman backs.
If they can play, they will play.”

Sherrill said a few months ago that he didn’t
believe any freshmen could start for his 1978 team;
today, he’s likely to say the man who said that had
laced his shoes too strenuously that morning.

Several Pitt players have also changed their tunes
of late. J o J 0 Heath, one of Pitt’s better runners, will
perform at defensive back next season. Bob
Hightower, a runner who promised (with words only)
great things upon his arrival at Pitt, has transferred
to the University of Hawaii. Linebacker Steve
Clemons, who lettered last season, and would have
played behind Al Chesley and Jeff Pelusi come fall,
has left Pitt. »

The seemingly entrenched players, too, are the
subjects of Sherrill’s experiments. Jeff Delaney, who
played the position called monster back until it was
decided blond, blue-eyed pre-med students don’t
play “monster back” (the name was changed to
strong safety), has been working at free safety.

A published report mentioned Matt Carroll (star-
ting guard. two years ago and starting tackle last
season) as a candidate for center.

The only guy for whom Sherrill isn’t considering a’

switch, it seems, is Sam Clancy. It was suggested to
Sherrill that the sight of Hugh Green at one end and
Clancy at the other might lead some teams to direct
their running backs not to the right, and not to the
left, but rather toward the hotel.

“I really don’t think about that,” Sherrill said,
admitting it would be nice, but reminding that Tim
Grgurich would be crazy to allow it. “But I’ll tell you
this: If Sam came up to me and wanted to play, I
don’t think I’d want to be the guy to tell him no.”

National League East: Once Again |t’s Phillies vs. Pirates .

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Vern Rapp, manager of the St.
Louis Cardinals might disagree, but
the National League Eastern
Division crown will again be won by
either the Philadelphia Phillies or
the Pittsburgh Pirates.

The Cardinals, picked by many to
crack Pennsylvania’s veritable lock
on the Eastern title, could only win
the division if Bowie Kuhn suddenly
decided to abolish pitchers and
install a machine in the center of the
infield. This, like all other decisions
handed down by the game’s
honcho, would be in the best
interest of baseball.

St. Louis is a team that is very
much like the little girl with the little

curl of nursery rhyme fame—where
they are good, they are very, very
good, but where they are bad, they

_ stink.

To go along with the best catcher
in baseball, Ted Simmons, the
Cardinals counter with a starting
rotation that is, at best, question-
able. John Denny, Bob Forsch, Eric
Rasmussen, Pete Falcone and John
Urrea would all have to have their
ﬁnest seasons in the same season
for St. Louis to challenge Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia. There is a better
chance Bowie will abolish pitchers.

The inﬁeld of Ken Reitz, Garry
Templeton, Mike Tyson and Keith
Hernandez is among the league’s
best, but a paper-thin bullpen and
an absence of a consistent longball

ByJIMMORRlSON
Pitt News Staff Writer

It ﬁgures to be another down-to-
the-wire race in the American
League East this year. Boston and
New York are the class of the
division, and, by September, should
be battling it out well ahead of the
rest of the pack.

But, like it or not, “the best team
money can buy” has the makings of
a dynasty and should prevail.

Paradoxically, the world cham-
pion Yankees’ only weakness is too
much talent. Newcomers Rich
Gossage, Rawly Eastwick and Andy
Messersmith join an already
crowded pitching staff. Owner
George Steinbrehner has carried
the maxim “Pitching wins pen-
nants” to the extreme, and Billy
Martin will wear a path from the
dugout to the mound.

Mike Torrez has defected to
Boston, Messersmith has already
been injured, and veterans Catﬁsh
Hunter and Ken Holtzman are still
big question marks. This leaves
starters Don Gullett, Ron Guidry
and Ed Figueroa to go with Sparky
Lyle, Dick Tidrow, A Gossage and
Eastwick in the bullpen—stil1
plenty of pitching, but hardly too
much.

The Yanks’ starting nine remains
basically the same, balanced,
productive and —barring all-out
war among the million-dollar
babies——capable of staying on top.

The Boston Red Sox, with the aid
of the most awesome offense in the
majors, should be breathing down
New York’s neck all summer. Last
year, seven Bosox combined for 177
home runs, and, with comebacks by
Fred Lynn and Dwight Evans,
Fenway fans can plan on more of the
same this year. Boston’s attack will
have a new dimension this year with
the addition of speedy second-
baseman Jerry Remy who swiped 41
bases for California in 1977.

But, if they’re to get the Al East
ﬂag, the Red Sox will need help
from Luis Tiant, Reggie Cleveland

Yankees Repeat in East

and Bill Lee, all less than
impressive last year. Bill Campbell
and Dick Drago will handle the bulk
of relief work, while new acquisi-
tions Torrez and Dennis Eckersly_
should combine for 30 to 35 wins.
However, manager Don Zimmer
will be hard-pressed to put together
a steady pitching rotation.

The Detroit Tigers, an up-and-
coming team that has yet to sign a
free agent, could be the surprise of
the American League this year.
Detroit will have a respectable
foursome of starters in Mark
Fidrych, Dave Rozema‘, Jack
Billingham and Jim Slaton, and will
get bullpen help from John Hiller
and Steve Foucalt.

The Tiger lineup has also become
a force to be reckoned with. Rusty
Staub, Ron LeFlore, Jason
Thompson and Steve Kemp, with a
little’ help from their teammates,

should put the Bengals well above -

the .500 mark in 1978.

Baltimore Orioles manager Earl
Weaver was upset last winter when
the front office dealt away Rudy
May, one of Weaver’s favorite
pitchers, while Ross Grimsley and
Dick Drago went the free agent
route. Unless ace Jim Palmer gets
some pitching help, Earl will be
moaning all season.

Milwaukee and Cleveland will
ﬁght for the division’s ﬁfth position.
The Brewers have put together a
strong offense with Larry Hisle,
Don Money and company, but a
shortage of quality pitching will
continue to plague the boys from
Beertown.

The Indians suffer from the same
malady. The departure of power
pitchers Jim Bibby and Dennis
Eckersley has left too much burden
on unproven pitchers.

Up in Toronto, the Blue Jays may
improve last year’s 54-107 mark by
six games or so, but—as evidenced
by their attendance in 1977 (fourth
best in the league)—Toronto is in no
hurry for a winner.

National

By JOHN FEYDO

Pitt News Staff Writer

For the fourth consecutive year, it
appears that the National League
West will be a two-team race.
Those two teams, of course, are the
Cincinnati Reds, managed by the
ever-optimistic Sparky Anderson,
and the Los Angeles Dodgers,
piloted by the even more optimistic
Tom LaSorda.

Last year, LaSorda’s first as
skipper of the “Big Blue Wrecking
Crew,” saw the Dodgers get off to a
red-hot start and hold on to coast
home 10 games ahead of Ander-
son's “Big Red Machine,” who had
put together back-to-back world
championships in 1975 and 1976.

The year 1978 promises a closer
race than any of the past three.
While the Dodgers are going with

threat combine to balance another
Cardinal strength with an equal
weakness. If the game were played
eight-against-eight, St. Louis would
be among the top teams in the
majors, but since it is nine-on-nine,
the Cardinals ﬁnish third in the
division.

The Pirates, once the most feared
offensive machine in the National
League, have undergone a complete
metamorphosis and will rely on
pitching and speed in making a run
at the Phillies. Gone are Richie
Zisk, Al Oliver and Richie Hebner,
with Bert Blyleven, Jim Bibby,
Elias Sosa and Wil McEnaney the
latest additions to a rejuvenated
mound staff.

Pittsburgh’s strengths are Dave
Parker who did a ﬁne imitation of
Bubbles the hippo when spring
training opened; Bill Robinson, the
best clutch hitter in the division,
and Rennie Stennett, who is, on two
healthy legs, the premier second
baseman in the National League,
including that short fellow from
Cincinnati with the flapping left
arm.

Things that could dampen
manager Chuck Tanner’s eternal
optimism (come Labor Day) are
looking to the bullpen and not
seeing Rich Gossage, Frank
Taveras, but only when a ground
ball is hit in his direction, and a
bench that provides little more
ﬁrepower than a six-month old
butane lighter.

If the question marks hanging
over the heads of Willie Stargell and
Omar Moreno are answered with
exclamation points, and Bert
Blyleven makes the transition from
the American to the National
League better than did Doc Medich,
the Phillies might head home after
the regular season instead of
waiting until after the playoffs.

Philadelphia is without question,
the team to beat in the division, but
every so often that is exactly what
happens to the frontrunner.

The squad is virtually the same
one that won 101 games in each of
the last two seasons. The outﬁeld
(Greg Luzinski, Garry Maddox and
Bake McBride) remains strong even
though Luzinski is the worst
defensive leftﬁelder in baseball.

The left side of the inﬁeld (Mike
Schmidt and Larry Bowa) is as good
as the right side (Ted Sizemore and
Richie Hebner or Jose Cardenal) is
weak. With Schmidt, Luzinski,
Maddox and'McBride, the Phillies
will not be lacking for offense, but
the $64,000 question for manager
Danny Ozark is whether the
pitchers can keep the opposition
ffom playing homerun derby.

One of baseball’s facts of life is
that three relievers (Tug McGraw,
Gene Garber and Ron Reed) and
two effective starters (Steve Carlton
and Larry Christenson) do not a
pitching staff make. If Ozark

doesn't get some help from Jim
Kaat and Dan Warthen, the
Philadelphia boo-birds could
migrate back to the city of Brotherly
Love.

Montreal is still a year or two
away from making serious noise in
the division race, but with a young
outﬁeld (Andre Dawson, Ellis
Valentine and Warren Cromartie) to
build around, it may not be long
before the ﬁrst World Series game
to be held outside the United States
is played. -

The only thing the Chicago Cubs
can provide are ﬁts for Curt Gowdy
whenever he announces one of their
games. With names like Manny
Trillo, Larry Bitner, Ivan DeJesus
and Steve Ontiveros, broadcasting a

Cubs’ game might even be a
challenge for Demosthenes.

The New York Mets ﬁnally have
some hitters (Steve Henderson and
Willie Montanez), but now all that
pitching is gone. Itis almost as if
the Mets are being forced to atone
for the sins of that other New York
baseball team. About the only noise
to be heard around Shea Stadium
this season will be the jets from
LaGuardia Airport.

The Phillies will edge the Pirates
for the division crown (even though
Pittsburgh will win the head-to-
head battle between the two teams).

but come. World Series time,’

Philadelphia, like the Pirates, will
be at home watching the games on
television.

Rangers Picked in West

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staffwriter _
Although many baseball tradi-

tionalists won’t like it—given the
free-wheeling spending of owner
Brad Corbett—the Texas Rangers
are headed for a championship in
the AL West, but it won’t be easy.

California and Kansas City
ﬁgure prominently in the race-V
said here to be the closest of the
four divisions—while Chicago can
be expected to generate some
excitement, if not a pennant, on the
city’s South Side. That leaves
Seattle, Minnesota and Oakland
(Denver), to contend for the last
three spots.

The Rangers main strength can
be found off the ﬁeld (tucked
somewhere between the folds of
millionaire Corbett’s wallet), but
the club will unveil some new faces
added through trade (Al Oliver)
and free agency (Richie Zisk).
Already considered two of the
ﬁnest offensive players in the
game, Oliver and Zisk, who teamed
with the Pirates two years ago, join
an already potent lineup of Claudell
Washington, Toby Harrah, Mike
Hargrove, Bump Wills, Jim Sund-
berg, Juan Beniquez and Bert
Campanairis.

Ranger pitching, while not the
best in the division, is talented and
deep enough to get the team
through the 162-game season
without any substantial losing
streaks.

Doyle Alexander, who notched
17 wins a year ago, ranks as the
staff’s top starter and will be
followed by Jon Matlack, Dock Ellis
and Doc Medich. For relievers,
manager Billy Hunter can choose
Jim Umbarger, Roger Moret, Len
Barker and Fergie Jenkins, who
also can start.

Adding considerable pressure to
the Ranger pennant quest will be
the Angels, a team ripped by
injuries to two key players last
year—Joe~ Rudi and Bobby Grich.
But the pair have been given clean
bills of health and are countedon to

provide the punch they couldn’t
offer last year.

Also coming to California is Ron
Fairly and Lyman Bostock, both of
whom will become ﬁxtures at first
base and the outﬁeld, respectively.
Bostock-is a bona-ﬁde .300 hitter
and will round out the lineup with
Rance Mulliniks at shortstop, Dave
Chalk at third, Ken Landreaux in

center, Brian Downing behind tlr '

plate and Don Baylor the DH.

The Angels will send some of the
ﬁnest pitching talent in the division
to the mound. Nolan Ryan and
Frank Tanana are the best pair of
starters in the majors and are
backed by Chris Knapp (who
California thought so highly
enough as to sacriﬁce Bobby
Bonds) and Ken Brett.

The Royals won the division last
year, a situation that led to 3
stand-pat policy over the winter.
Meanwhile, rivals Texas and
California have improved to the
extent that K.C. can begin making
reservations for a third place spf )
despite the presence of three
highly touted rookies: Clint Hurdle,
Willie Wilson and U.L. Washing-
ton.

The White Sox lost Richie Zisk
and Oscar Gamble to teams whose
owners were more willing to meet
their salary demands, but the
off-season acquisition of Bobby
Bonds will ease the offensive
pressure from Chet Lemon, Lamar
Johnson, Ralph Garr and Jorge
Orta.

Chicago’s pitching is thin, but
adequate enough to avert anything
lower than a fourth place showing.

Look for Seattle to surprise——
mainly on the strength of yq in
sters like Ruppert Jones—-.-’ 2-.-
Minnesota, in the wake" of
free-agency departures by Bostock
and Larry Hisle, is expected to limp
somewhere near the bottom, the
hitting exploits of Rod Carew
notwithstanding. And Oakland is
the worst team in baseball, no
matter where they play.

)

League West: Lasorda To Make Anderson Blue

last season, the Reds will have Tom
Seaver for the entire year and are
counting on him for about 25

victories.
As Anderson claims, the Reds do

have the best eight-man team in
baseball. Perennial all-star and
gold glove winner John Bench is
behind the plate. Danny Dreissen
took over at ﬁrst base last season
and was actually an improvement
over the departed Tony Perez. Joe
Morgan, possibly the best player in
the NL is back at second, while Dave
Concepcion will be at short.
Another gold glover, Cesar
Geronimo, anchors the outﬁeld and
is ﬂanked by the awesome George
Foster (52 homers, 149 RBI, .320) in
left and speedster Ken Griffey in
right. Last, but not least, the
irrepressible Pete Rose will be at

reach the 3,000 hit plateau, which
has been achieved by only 12 men in
baseball history.

But LaSorda’s starting eight isn’t
bad either. Slugging Steve Garvey
is at first base and has also won four
consecutive gold gloves. He heads
a strong inﬁeld featuring speedy
Davey Lopes at second, hard-hitting
Ron Cey at third, and steady Bill
Russell at short. Dusty Baker
enjoyed a banner year in leftﬁeld
last year, as did switch-hitting
Reggie Smith in right.

Centerﬁelder Rick Monday suf-
fered with a back injury last season,
and LaSords is hoping Monday is
100 percent this year. Behind the
plate, Steve Yeager won’t hit with
Bench, but is on a par with him
defensively.

In a pinch, the Dodgers can call

almost the exact team they ﬁelded third. Rose needs only 34 hits to On Such ancient batsmen as Manny

Mota (.395) and Vic Davalillo (.313)
to pound out a few more hits while
Lee Lacy, Teddy Martinez, and
Glenn Burke provide depth and
versatility. Backing up Yeager are
old pros Jerry Grote and Johnny
Oates.

LaSorda’s staff boasts ﬁve strong
starters, featuring the
Man,” Tommy John (20-7, 2.78),
Don Sutton (14-8, 3.19), Rich
Rhoden (16-10, 3.75), Burt Hooten
(12-7, 2.62), and Doug Rau (14-8,
3.44).

Anderson can counter only with
his ace, Seaver (21-6, 2.59), Bill
Bonham (10-13, 4.35), acquired
from the Cubs, lefty Fred Norman
(14-13, 3.38), and youngsters Paul
Moskau (6-6, 4.00) and Tom Hume
(3-3, 7.12).

In the bullpen, things are about

equal. W The Reds have Pedro 1

“Bionic -

Borbon, Dale Murray, Bair Tomlif '
and Manny Sarmiento. _‘
knuckleballing Charlie Houign,
Mike Garman, Forester and Lance
Rautzhan.

Overall, it looks like the Dodgers
by three games over the Reds.

The battle for third place should
be between Bill Virdon’s Houston
Astros, featuring the hard hitting of
Cesar Cedeno, Jose Cruz and Bob
Watson and the strong right arms of
J .R. Richard and Jaoquin Andujar
and the San Francisco Giants, who
should be improved with the
acquisition of Bowie  "A.
favorite player, Vida Blue. 4- 
San Diego and Atlanta both have
new managers, but little else.
Roger Craig has taken over with the
Padres and Bobby Cox is the latest
Braves skipper.

Pole vaulter Gene Roach, who

breaking the team outdoor mark
last weekend at the Virginia

McDonald captured ﬁrst place in
the SO00-meter run.

Roach, a freshman from Wash-
ington, Pa., ﬁnished second in the
competition by vaulting 15 feet.

McDonald’s victory in the 5000
meters (14:57) paced Pitt to a
fourth-place in the team standings
behind Maryland, Penn State and
Virginia, with West Virginia,
