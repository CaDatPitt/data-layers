Chief item programmed for the

Clock.” Papa Haydn, the father of
modern symphony, composed

culiar rhythm gives the symphony
its name, a minuet, and a conclud-
ing allegro movement.

Soloists on the program are Mir-

of the soprano arias from Rossini’s
opera, “The Barber of Seville;” and
Robert Brown, C39, who will play,

gogues on the Day of Atonement.
Both Miss Goldstein and Brown will
be accompanied by the orchestra.

F or Elections

Swinging into the “home stretch”
of election campaigning are the two

campus parties and the assorted un- I

aﬂiliated candidates for posts to be
ﬁlled in the general student elections
scheduled for Friday from 8:30 to
5:30 o’clock in Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial hall.

Publication for the “Foo News,”
party organ, the mailing of slates to
enrolled party members featured the
activities of the re-organized Inde-
pendent Party, whose aim is to break
the hold of the fraternities on campus
elective positions.

No activity on the fraternity front
was reported, although it was under-
stood that meetings have been held to
draw up slates.

Spokesmen for the fraternities
have stated that there will be no
public announcement of the candi-
dates of the party. Independent
Party candidates were announced in
The News at the time of the party’s
nominating convention.

University Alumni

Voting, via the mail, is now taking
place to determine which two alumni
members of the University will be-
come members of the Board of
Trustees.

More than 4,000 ballots have been
mailed out to members of the Gen-
eral Alumni Association. The bal-
lots are to be returned before May 1.

Four candidates are running for
the two positions, which become
available when Wilbur D. Hocken-
smith, ’01, and Norman MacLeod,
’17, vacate their trusteeship on July
1, the date when their three-year
terms expire.

Mr. MacLeod is running for re-
election. The other three candidates
are Floyd Rose, 11; Herbert N. Riley,
"12; and Ira R. Hill, ’24.

lations, as printed elsewhere in The
News, will hold unconditionally, the
only exceptions being for faculty
members, who will be notiﬁed of a
special sale through the University.

All members of the Cap and
Gown business staff will meet in
the conference room, eighth ﬂoor,
at 2:30 o’clock today.

Members of all Cap and Gown
staffs, choruses, and cast are re-
quested to get in touch with their
respectivo managers and reserve
their tickets before the general sale
tomorrow.

Students working on the Cap and
Gown production are eligible for
special seats, but must communicate
with their respective staff managers
today in order to be assured that their
reservations will be valid for better
seats.

No tickets will be available for
Tuesday night, May 2. All students
are requested to avoid going Friday
and Saturday evenings, as better seats
may be obtained on Monday, VVecl-
nesday, and Thursday nights, Biddle
said.

Students, F acuity‘ Present Views

Students Condemn Law
As Not Effecting Peace

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN, Texas, April 19—Ask 100
typical American college students
whether they believe the present
neutrality law can keep the United
States out of war, and less than seven
will answer “yes.”

An overwhelming majority of 93.3
per cent of the students of the nation
shake their heads at the possible ef-
fectiveness or the law in case of war,
interviewers on campuses from coast
to coast have discovered in a poll
conducted by the Student Opinion
Surveys of America. The Pitt News
cooperates in the polls.

With Congress wrangling over
neutrality and the President report-
edly ready to back any move to re-

University Professors
Suggest Improvements

By Jack Brady

In a poll taken in colleges through-
out the country, 93 per cent of the
students indicate belief that the Neu-
trality Act as it stands at the present
time is ineffective. This also seems
to be the concensus of opinion among
members of the faculty in the polit-
ical science department, economics
department and sociology depart-
ment.

They reply to the question, “What
is your opinion of the Neutrality
Act?” Dr. Benjamin H. Williams,
professor of political science, says,
“It cannot be effective in case of a
European war because emotions
arising in the United States would
support and probably stimulate the

HE drums of war are rolling.

And as they roll. the pipes of peace are muted.
are drowned out by the swelling crescendo.

But tomorrow, on college campuses throughout
the country, the din will stop monientarily. At 11
a. m., many thousands of students will lay aside
bright ROTC uniforms, will desert drill grounds,
will stop dreaming of the nice cushy war pilots’
jobs being oﬁered by the government.

For, at this time, they will be answering the call
of the United Student Peace Committee, which has
designated tomorrow as “Peace Action Day.” They
‘will hear speakers dramatically extoll the abstrac-
tions of war.

“Are ‘We Drifting Into \Var?”

The students at the l"niversit_v are not taking i

their proportionate share in this week’s nation-wide
tlcinoiistrations. But they have struck the keynote
of one of the most (lisilli1si(>1ic(l. pessimistic genera-
t3«::—1s.<: of college youth with their topic . . . “Are “Ye
l)1'll"i;ll‘lg Into \Vat'?”

‘ﬁfitli tomorrow's student demonstrators, they
v.'i'il rc-ex:-iniinc the trends of the times. 'l‘hcy will
deplore the suicidal armaments race in which na-

on “'clel’ciise" inc-asurcs while millions remain with-
out aslctguatc living standards: and wlicrc science

Soznc of the more 'lll0ll§2'lllf1ll will cast a ques-
tioning eye toward our halls of education. They
will hear the thud of n1:-u~ching feet on campus
g_»;r(_><>:i.-:v.r.¢irds; they will hear the whir of propcllors
in the air, as students learn the art of air combat
and lioniliiiw; of innocent women and children; they
will rcrncinbcr that instructions in the art of mass
nn'.ril<-r are given out in college and university
classes daily.

And they will wonder whether they are not
being naive in questioning whether tliis is the
.<:n*eadi1ig of enlightenment which cducators have
tolil them so plati’c11r.linoi1sl_v is the function of
liighcr education. "

Already bcfoggcd, they will have read their
morning newspapers, and become thoroughly con-
fused. They will read, on the one hand, of good-
intcntioneil legislators and statesincn urging a pol-
icy of complete isolation in a world in which na-

nounced toda_v. is oft'e1'ing two scliolai-ships to
re-fi'1gee~~stude11ts in cooperation-.-with the Student
Refugee committee-’s non-sectarian drive.

The move made by the University is an appro-
priate gesture in these times of intolerance among
natioiialities, 1'cligl011S. and 1-aces. It is a recogni-
tion of the humanitarian aspect of the current na-
tion-wide intclcollcgiate drive. and aligns the Uni-
versity with the progressive forces in other uni-
versities, with leaders in educational and civic life
who are heartily endorsing the niovcmcnt‘.

Only two scliolarsltips have been proV'i-dcd, it is

ing on intolerance that 21 wliolci-‘ale iininigratiou is
planned. The present move. by its limited scope. is
merely a gesture in the right direction. But in con-
junction with similar small movements on other

=which has given various indications
,-that the United States should take a
iﬁrm stand on the side of the de-
 mocracies.
= The question used in the survey:
“Do you believe our present neutral-
ity law can keep us out of war?"
The answers:
YES . . . . . . . . . . .. 6.7 per cent

i And with remarkable uniformity,
’-students of almost every part of the

most identical number".

-ineffectiveness of the.‘ neutrality act
was that no law of any kind can keep
jthe country out of a general war un-
ider the present system of interna-
tional politics, mainly because of our
economic interests. Said :1 Michigan.
student enrolled at Wayne university,
“The act is little more than useless.
We could keep out of war probably if
we aided countries in defeating na-
tions which are endangerirg our
peace.” ‘ .
That opinion seems to reflect the

men and women who in previous
polls have voted this way: Sell
planes to democracies and not to die-
tatorships; 52.8 per cent; approve of
rearmament, 71.8 per cent; build an
army and navy strong enough to pro-
tect the “etitire W‘e'stern"Hemisphere,

government in its evident trend to-
ward intervention.”

Dr. Verne C. l/Vright, associate
professor of sociology, thinks, “It has

countries and to the disadvantage of
; clemocracies.”

 Question: What suggestions can
fyou make in order to improve the
lpresent Neutrality Act?_

Dr. Charlesforth declared, “I sug-
gest no distinction be made between
munitions and other articles of inter-
national commerce and that the pres-
ident be empowered to select the ag-
gressor in future conflicts and apply
an embargo against that country.”

Dr. Elmer D. Graper says, “I be-
lieve it would be best to give the
chief e:\:ecut.ive power to decide what
we should sell to aggressoi‘ or non-
aggressor. Con_-:ess can hardly de-
termine this matter in advance.”

Dr. Francis D. Tyson says, “I fa-
Ivor
to the act to give the president dis-
cretion in applying the provisions
of the act to nations whose aggres-
sion endangers American interests.”

Question: Do you believe that the
United States can remain out of war?

Dr. Charlesworth says, “I believe
the United States can keep out of a
rnajor war if it sacriﬁces its political
ideals and relinquishes its rank as a
world power.”

Dr. VVilliams says, “After .3 few
months of warfare on a large scale
in Europe, a rising state of emotions
here would probably get us into the
war.”

Dr. Wright says, “I believe that our

Phi Cams Top Intramural Race;
Phi Delt Nine Remains Unbeaten

As mushball action begins again%

this week after the Easter--vacationi
lapse, Phi Delta Theta is leading in,
the race for fraternity honor‘. I

The Phi Delts took over undisput-
ed possession of ﬁrst place on April’
4 by stopping Pi Lambda Phi, 7-1,
behind the steady hurling of Bob
Dannies.

Bert Jaffe, the Pi Lam southpaw,
was “hot” for the ﬁrst four innings,
setting some sort of a record in the
third frame by striking out the side
on nine pitches. Bert staked him-
self to a one run lead with a ﬁrst
inning homer, and then protected it
with some fancy pitching which in-
cluded ten strikeouts.

MENDLOW PITCHES

The Phi Delts ﬁnally caught him
with a two run rally in the ﬁfth, and
then clinched the game with a five
run explosion in the sixth.

Meanwhile, Delta Tau Delta slip-
ped from the ranks of the undefeat-
ed, bowing to the Phi Eps, 8-5. The
Phi Ep win boosted them into a
fourth place tie with the Pi Lams.

With ‘their’ ace‘ pitcher’, Lew Mend-
low, returning to action, Sigma Al-
pha VMu tripped Phi Kappa Alpha,
4-1, to stay close to the" top. Lew
Mendlow, whose
blazing fast ball featured the game,
was absent when the Sammies suf-
fered their only defeat, a shutout at
the hands of Dannies, and the Phl
Delt.

Director Potts has announced that
intramural competition in tennis and
golf deﬁnitely will begin this spring
“as soon as old man weather gives us
a break,”

PHI GAMS LEAD

First place winners only in volley-
ball during the winter season, Phi
Gamma Delta still succeeded in pick-
ing up enough points to push into the
number one spot in the race for the
Intramural All Point Trophy, ac-
cording to the totals released recent-
ly by Potts.

The Phi Gains hav amassed 398
points to place ahead of Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kappa,
and Nev:.Iman Club. Any team in any
Intramural league is eligible for the
trophy which will be awarded at the
close of the 1938-39 school year.

Emphasis has been placed on com-
petition, points being given both for
entering teams and for simply play-
ing games, with the result that sev-
e;al clubs are well up in the list of
point scorers without having won

All candidates for assistant base-
ball manager should report to either
coach Ralph Mitterling or varsity
manager Dick Jones at the Stadium
at 3 o'clock today.

Pitt Gait Team
Meets Tartans

Next Saturday a revamped golf
squad will inaugurate the season
with Tech. This will be the ﬁrst on
the schedule of ten matches, ﬁve of
which will be in Eastern Association
competition.

Graduation left the golf team pret-
ty well riddled with Tony Kay, Bill
Daddio,  Ed Lawry as the only
remaining last year men. Frank
Souchak and George Simpson, No. 1
and No. 5 men respectively, were the
two Pitt linksmen whose graduation
was most felt. The No. 2 man, Bar-
rett Melvin, dropped out of school.

Kay will probably be the No. 1
man on this season’s outﬁt, since he

.was undefeated in association match-

es last year. Dacldio and Lawry will
make up the backbone of the rest of
the team.

As usual the Panthers will use the
Alcoma Country Club as their home
course and Art Snyder, Alcoma pro,
will again serve as coach.

“Better than I expected.”

That, in brief. sums up the atti-
tude of baseball coach Ralph Mitter-
ling toward his diamond proteges
after a four game trip through the
South during Easter recess.

The Panthers dropped four starts
to Georgetown, Duke, and South

Carolina, but the losses were scarce-
ly unexpected with a green team that
was far behind its rivals in experi-
ence and conditioning.

Vt’hen the defeats are examined
objectively, the Panthers are placed
in a much better light than the
scores would , indicate. Opening
against a Georgetown .club that had
just beaten Yale for its 20th con-
secutive win, Pitt yielded seven
runs in the ﬁrst inning on ﬁve walks,
three hits, two errors, and ’a pair of
passed balls, yet lost only 10-7.

Against Duke, one of the nation’s
outstanding college nines, Pitt held a
5-4 lead" in tl‘le"seventh‘ inning, but
the'Blue Devils’ power accounted for
six runs in the last half of the frame,
then carried Duke Ion to a 13-6 vic-
tory. ' ‘

Pitt connected for eight hits in the
third game but crossed the plate only
three times while the Blue Devils
were slugging away, piling up a 19-3
win. The two game total gave Duke
122 tallies in seven matches, or 18
per game.

The ﬁrst big event to be held un-¢

der the new spring intramural pro-
gram will be the Interfraternity
Swimming meet tomorrow night in
the Trees Pool. From the list of
entries received up to date, the meet
promises to be a success.

Athletic chairmen of the campus
fraternities were all notiﬁed of the
meet and have been holding prac-

vanced notices, the Phi Gamms and
the Kappa Sigs loom as the two im-

ming crown. ‘

’If the Fijis do win. they will fur-
ther increase their lead in the new
’in'tramural‘ ‘ team ‘ standings. * How-
ever, a Kappa Sig win would not

On Campus

Carnival to Feature
Nationality Villages

The Carnival Night committee
has announced that the Thursday
night attraction will be cast in the
theme of nationality villages.

With an eye on the foreign situ-
ation, lest any of their “nationali-
ties” be gobbled up in the interim,
the committee tentatively an-
nounces that there will be six vil-
lages styled in the manner of early
American, Chinese, German, Ital-
ian, Russian, and English villages.
The villages will be supervised by
18 campus organizations, three of
which will collaborate on each vil-
lage.

The committee hinted this week
that archery might be played in
the English and Early American
villages. '

Contrary to past practices, the
refreshment booths will be" super-
vised by the general festival com-
mittee, which will divide the pro-
ceeds among all_the participating
organizations. ,

The Carnival Night is the only
attraction of he week that will be
open to the public.

“ lothes will make the man”
at the Spring Festival .Tea
Dance. Feature of the Wednesday
“Joe and Josephine College” dance
will be a contest in search of the
typically “college-attired” couple,
according to Herman Schmidt,
BA40, business manager. Judges,
who will have the formidable task
of determining “typical college ap-
parel,” have not been announced.

Edwin Ellis, Festival chai1‘man,
announced this week that Larry
Rothman, C41, has been appointed
chairman of the Friday “Campus
Circus” dance chairman. Business
manager is Pat Cusick, E40. The

committee includes: Doris Wacker,
William Allen, Betty Oestreicher,
Walter Lovett, Clint Sipe, Bob
Schooley, Mary Louise McClain,

Assembly Passes Bill

To Investigate Payroll

Investigation of salaries paid by
ithe University was ordered by the

lstate legislature in one of two recentﬁ

';Harrisburg moves affecting the Uni-
éversity.
I The second move was a bill intro-
gduced by Representative Al Tronzo
?(D., Pittsburgh) which, if enacted
i“would provide tenure for the teach-
iing staffs at all state-operated and
gstate-aided educational institutions.”
5 Besides the University, Penn State
college, Temple university, and the
:University of Pennsylvania, among
gothers would be affected by the ten-
lure act which provides that “instruct-
iors in the institutions may be‘ dis-
missed only for speciﬁed causes.”
Immorality, incompetency, intem-
perance, cruelty, willful negligence,
mental derangement, persistent and
willful violation of the school laws,
[and “substantial decrease in the
number of pupils or‘ students,” are
among the specified causes that make

proposed law.

The inquiry into University sala-
ries, “from that of Chancellor John
G. Bowman down,” is being under-
taken before ﬁnal action on the bi-
ennial appropriation for the school is
taken. An appropriation of $1,188,-
000 was recommended for the school
,by Governor Arthur H. James.

All University ﬁnances, scholar-
ships, and expenses will be studied
by the appropriation committee.
