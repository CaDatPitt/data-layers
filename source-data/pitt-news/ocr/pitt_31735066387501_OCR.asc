IFC plans Halloween party

By Marc Duchin

Assistant News Editor

Members of Pitt fraternities and
sororities will be celebrating Hal-
loween a little early this year at
the School for Blind Children, lo-

'cated in north Oakland.‘

According to Craig Jackson,
public relations chairman for the
lnterfraternity Council, Pitt frater-
nity and sorority members will at-
tend a Halloween party and p_lay
various games with the children
at the blind school from 7 to 9
p.m. on Oct 29.

Jackson said that the School for
Blind Children was designated as

 _'tl'l_e_l.9_.88‘ charity for-Pittfs; Greek»  '

Week.
”The blind school is just so

close to Oakland; I guess we kept

overlooking it,” said Jackson.

Jackson added that the sched-
uled Halloween party marked the
first time that fraternities and
sororities worked with the Greek
Week charity prior to Greek
Week.

’’It would be nice [in the future]
to pick a charity in the summer
and have a Halloween party with
them and then do a Christmas
party,” said Jackson. ”That way
people will have a closer contact

with who they're raising money‘

for.” f

  

big party,” said Sarah GiIders-
Ieeve, a coordinator of the Hal-
Ioween party at the blind school.
”They [the school children] are
very excited about it.”

Gildersleeve said that she was
hesitant when Pitt's IFC suggest-
ed the party.

”Not everyone can handle
working with these kids,” said
Gildersleeve. ”Half of the kids
are just visually impaired, the
other half have multiple Chan-
dicaps;

”Sometimes when people see
kids in wheelchairs,- it makes
them uneasy,” Gildersleeve said.

Wall Street suffers
biggest blow since‘
Great Crash of '29

By Peter Coy

AP Business Writer

NEW YORK — The stock mar-
ket plunged out of control Mon-
day in a selling panic that rivaled
the Great Crash of 1929, pushing
the Dow Jones average down
more than 500. points, draining
more than $500 billion from the
value of stocks and sending shock
waves -around the world.

”Whether today was a financial
meltdown or not  I wouldn't
want to be around for one worse
than this,” said John Phelan,
chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange.

The Dow's plunge to 1,738.74
left it 22.6 percent below Friday's
level, a one-day loss far larger
than the 12.8 percent drop on
Oct. 28, 1929, known as Black
Monday, or Oct. 29, 1929, when
it fell an additional 11.7 percent.

The Dow average’s worst per-
centage decline ever was on Dec.
12, 1914, early in World War I,
when it lost 24.4 percent of its
value.

The market fed on itself in
wave after wave of selling in the
busiest trading day ever on the
New York Stock Exchange.

The Dow industrials fell
508.32 points to 1,738.74, ac-
cording to a preliminary reading,
a loss of nearly 1,000 points since
the market's peak Aug. 25.

The latest decline left the Dow
industrial average about 36 per-
cent below its peak of 2,722.42
on Aug. 25 and at its lowest point
since April 1986.

The collapse of prices caused

that underpins the growth of the,‘ a

”We’re having extreme panic!‘
in the marketplace. It's |i_ke Ar-nf

man, director of market analysis-
for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. 
Louis. ' '

into a worldwide downturn. _ '

’’In a nutshell, this thing could
go further. There's a domino ef-
fect here,” said Leonard Grimal-;.
di, executive vice president of:
Amivest Corp. in New York.

“This is a dangerous day to say
the least, and we are not alarmists
here,” Grimaldi said.

Earlier Monday, panic selling. J

to be any major news event that,
caused it. A selling trend that 
picked up speed in the middle of
last week simply gained unstop-_‘

Underlying the market's

Stephen G. Crane sentenced him
on the single gun possession
count on which he was con-
victed.

The crime carries a maximum
penalty of seven years in prison,

Goetz rarely go to jail.

Goetz also was sentenced to
five years of probation and 280

”A non-jail sentence for Mr.

center after they were handed a
check for $1.4 million by state
Revenue Secretary Barton Fields.
The couple, who purchased the

‘ticket jointly, will receive similar

payments annually for the next
26 years.

The value of the jackpot sur-
passed by $5 million the previous
North American record, $41 mil-
lion won in New York in August
1985, said Jim Scroggins, execu-
tive director of the Pennsylvania
Lottery. The world's largest jack-
pot, about $100 million, is
offered in Spain, state lottery offi-
cials said.

Woomer, 55, who is separated
but not divorced from his wife,

said he didn't know what legal ar- 1

rangements would be worked out
with her. Asked if she likely
would get some of the prize,
Woomer said: ’’I imagine so.”

i“U.S. retaliates against Iranian oil platforms

By a 3-3 vote, the court af-
firmed a federal appeals court de-
cision that the Reagan
administration may have acted
illegally in denying visas to four
people invited to this country by
American citizens.

Because of the split vote, to-
day's one-sentence ruling does
not establish a ’ national
precedent. _

The court lacks one member
because of the vacancy created
by the retirement of Justice Lewis
F. Powell. Justices Harry A. Black-
mun and Antonin Scalia took no
part in today's decision.

The ruling was unsigned and
the breakdown of the vote by the
participating justices was not dis-
closed. . _

The decision upholds a 2-1 rul-
ing in 1986 by the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here. The ap-
peals court overturned a judge's
ruling allowing the administra-
tion to bar a Nicaraguan official,
two Cuban Communist Party offi-
cialsand an Italian member of a

group allegedly controlled by the

Soviet Union._

relationships. The attitude that
there are certain. roles women
should play and roles men should
play persists. Everybody is ex-
pecting the other person to do
something,.and as such, nothing
happens. ,

Bowman explained, ’’It is also
because people's expectations
are too high. I hear men say,’l’m
not going with this person be-
cause she is not cute enough, she
doesn't dress right. She is not this,
not that. I’m not even going to try
it.’ And some things women say,
’He is too quiet, too short,
although, he may have money
he doesn't even have a car, what
are we going to do, take a bus?’
These are shallow values to have.

THE PITT NEWS

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

When Pitt junior Glen Ryan
was attending Seneca Valley
High School a few years back,
Pitt head cross country coach Jim
Lear thought that he had poten-
tial as a runner.

Lear described Ryan as being 0

"a skinny kid who would some-

day make a good runner."
Well "someday" has come,

and the skinny kid from Seneca

Valley has become the good run-
ner that Coach Lear had envi-
sioned many years ago.

Along with adding a lot of
depth to the young distance pro-
gram at Pitt, Ryan's major contri-
butions include finishing fifth in
the Big East Championship in-
door 5,000-meter run and fifth
also in the outdoor championship
10,000-meter run last year.

_ Lear now describes him as be-
ing "dependable, hard-working
and very responsible.”

Ryan has become a much
relied-on runner for the Panthers’
cross country team this season,
usually finishing third on the
squad.

With the Big East Cross Coun-
try Championships taking place
on Oct. 24, Coach Lear is look-
ing to Ryan for a strong finish.

"Ryan is usually a very depend-
able runner,” said Lear, "but,
more importantly, he tends to run
well when it really counts. We
hope he finishes in the Top 20 at

the Big East Championships.”

The reason why Ryan runs es-_

pecially well in big meets is a
combination of greater concen-
tration and a strong respect for
Pitt's running tradition.

"I think I run better, especially
at the Big East Championships,
because it _is a team goal that we
work toward the entire season. I
concentrate more on that meet
than others," said Ryan.

"I also feel an obligation not to
let the Pitt running tradition down

- Several members of the
1986 Pitt Panther football
team found themselves
signed, sealed and delivered
onto the rosters of National
Football League teams with
the passing of this year's col-
lege draft. V
Lineman Tony Woods be-
came a first—round selection of
the Seattle Seahawks, and in
the process, a millionaire.
Offensive guard Randy Dix-
on was snapped up in the

lis Colts, a selection that many
analysts considered a major
steal.

Fullback Tom Brown be-
came the seventh—round selec-
tion of the fullback—depleted
Miami Dolphins and had little
trouble making the team.

But for Steve Apke, the road
to the NFL was a little steeper
and a lot more frustrating than
waiting around for that draft-
day telephone call from the
Seahawks, Colts or
whomever.

You see, Apke wasn't draft-
ed at all.

He was a free agent — a
player that no team really
wants badly enough to use as
a draft pick, one that has to
bust his behind just to catch
the. coaches’ attention.

So, since Apke was from the
University of Pittsburgh, a lo-
cal school with a semi-rich tra-
dition at that position, the
Pittsburgh Steelers brought
him into camp and gave him
a tryout. ..

Then they cut him — twice.

With Mike Merriweather,
David Little, Bryan Hinkle and

fourth round by the |ndianapo- ‘

Robin Cole, the Steelers were
pretty solid at the linebacking
position. Solid enough that
they didn't quite need what
Apke had to offer. He was
released near the end of train-
ing camp.

Of course, the players strike
rolled around, and suddenly
the Steelers needed any foot-

. ball player they could get their
hands on. Thus, Apke was
brought back into camp and

immediately named a starter

on Pittsburgh's replacement
squad.

,”One thing I'll say, this ex-
perience was a lot different
than - training camp," Apke
said Sunday after P-ittsburgh’s
21-7 win over the Indianapo-
lis Colts. "When we were at
St. Vincent [the Steelers train-
ing camp site], all we did was
practice, practice, practice.
The coaches didn't really get
a good look at me. I did get in

, for a few plays in some of the
preseason games, but nothing
they could really give me a fair
judgement on." »

As a "scab" Steeler, Apke‘
did give the coaches some-'
thing they could judge him on.
In three games he contributed
18 tackles, tops among all
Steelers — replacements and
regulars included. Although,
the regulars played in only two
contests this season before the
strike hit.

"[The coaches] definitely
got a better look at me," said
Apke. "At least they've got
some game film to look at."

But with the striking players
coming back to the clubs this
week, Apke's status on the
club was, once again, on
shaky ground, but not for long.

Yesterday, the earth came

Close, but 

Former Panther A

Steve Apke's 18 tackles weren't enoughlto keep him on the

up and smacked Apke in the
face..Apke, along with 23
other scab players, was cut.
For Apke it was the second
time in less than three months
the Steelers gave him his walk-
ing papers. ,
After the Steelers win Sun-
day, Apke knew his future
with a team loaded with
talented linebackers was all
too ominous. "There's really
nothing I can control at this
point," he said. "The only
thing I can control is what I do
on the football field. All I
know is I went out and played
as hard as I could those past
three games. I thought I played
well. I don't know if that's
good enough to make the

pke released ain by Steelers

regular team, but I gave it my
best shot.

"I'm taking every day one at
a time. I hope I can hang on.”

But even though Apke failed
in his second attempt to make
the Steelers’ roster, he believes
his efforts weren't wasted.

"I learned a lot from this. I
enjoyed playing for [Pittsburgh
Steelers] Coach [Chuck] Noll.
He's a very aggressive coach,
and even though he says few
words, he expects you to get
the job done  This whole
thing was a good experience
for me.”

On Sunday, Noll had been
indecisive about the future of
the replacement players. "It's
difficult to say what's going to

 

. ment p|ayers]," said Noll. "|

statements, Noll suddenly b’e- ._ I  -.5

maybe even a few weeks. But.

And that meant the end of

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) —
The Syracuse University foot-
‘ ball team hada sellout crowd

audience watching its 48-21
demolition of Penn State last
Saturday.

But, perhaps, most impor-
tantly, some of the best high
school football players in the
nation were watching the im-
pressive Syracuse per-
formance.

The stunning victory could
sway several blue chip recruits
- to decide to play in the Carri-
er Dome in Syracuse and fur-
ther the Orange effort to
displace Penn State as top dog
in the East.

’’It was a.huge step forward
for the program,” Coach Dick
MacPherson said.

of 50,011 and a CBS television '

Many potential recruits were
visiting the Syracuse campus
and watched the emotional
win over Penn State.

”lf they weren't here, they
saw «it on TV,” MacPherson
said. ”The impact was there.
The key is to take advantage of
it."

The fast start by Syracuse, in-
cluding the lopsided win over
Penn State, could certainly
make life easier for the coach-
ing staff, which last season had
to go out and attempt to sell
players on a program that had
lost its first four games.

”The recruiting process sud-
denly becomes much easier.
Now it's fun,” MacPherson
said. "Before, we had to fight
like hell just to get some kids
to talk to us”

The day after the victory
over Penn State, Syracuse
recruiting coordinator Bob
Casullo was making phone
calls and sending notes to
players who may become fu-
ture Orangemen.

Casullo said he's sure SU’s
win over Penn State will make
a difference with some of the
prospects who were in town
over the weekend. He
wouldn't disclose any names
or even say‘ how many
prospective recruits attended,
but _he did say he was happy
with the turnout.

”Let’s just say it was a very
good amount, and a very high
quality amount,” Casullo said.
’’I definitely sensed a lot of ex-
citement in the recruits after
the game. I saw the excitement‘

Recruits taking longer look at Syracuse

in their faces and in the way
they were talking. And what

. excites me is some of those

guys are really high on our
list.”

Casullo also says Syracuse's
unbeaten status and the possi-
bility -of playing in a major
bowl has put recruiting at
another level. In past years, the
Orange sometimes had to-set-
tle for leftovers — players
other schools didn't want.

”We’re trying to move into
a higher echelon of recruit-

— ing,” Casullo said. ”We want

to recruit the same-type kids as
Penn State, Miami, Notre
Dame, Pittsburgh and Ohio
State. We think we can now
compete with those schools

Series

Continued from page 5
Their first steal in the Series came
in the eighth inning of game 2,
when they were trailing 8-2.

Are the Twins that good, or are
the Cardinals that bad?

”They look pretty good to me,”
Herzog said. ”They’re a hot
club.”

The fact remains, though, that
this hot club, this club that blew
Detroit out of the American
League playoffs in five games and
has Herzog’s Cardinals on the
ropes, won just 85 games all sea-
son. Eight other teams, including
the departed Tigers and the reel-
ing Cardinals, had better records.
So what's going .on here?

”What we are doing now is not
that complicated,” explained
Minnesota manager Tom Kelly.
”We are getting good pitching,
catching the ball in the field and
getting the chance to score some
runs. That is-the perfect formula.”

Because of the built-in off days
in the playoff and World Series
schedule, a team can get by with
thin pitching, which describes
Minnesota's condition perfectly.
If the Cardinals and Twins play
seven games, St. Louis will see
Frank Viola and Bert Blyleven,
winners of the first two, five
times.

If you don't think the formula
works, Herzoglhas evidence to
the contrary.

in 1985,.when his team hit
.185 in the Series, Herzog near-
ly finessed the Cardinals to the

. championship with two pitchers,

Danny Cox and John Tudor,

combining to start eight of the 13

playoff and Series games. ‘
That year, St. Louis won the

first two games of the ‘Series on“

the road and still founda way to

V lose to Kansas City in seven. Last

year, Boston won the first two in
New York and lost to the Mets in
seven. So Minnesota's 2-0 lead is
not insurmountable, a fact that

‘has not escaped Herzog the

historian.

”We need a well—pitched
game,” the manager said. ”And
if we score some runs, we might
be all right.”

They might be all right, too, if
they had their team. Withoutlack
Clark and with Terry Pendleton
ailing, the Cards are trying to fly
on one wing.-

great deal as a runner since his
transfer to the main campus.

’’I like this program a lot better
than UPJ’s,” said Ryan. ”Running
at UPJ wasn't much different than
running in high school. Here at
Pitt, we have top runners and
compete against many Division I
schools. We train a lot harder
here and have better trainers and
facilities. it's a more enjoyable.

”Our coaches are great,” con-
tinued Ryan, ”especia||y Coach
Lear. i like him a lot and have a
great deal of respect for him. I
have full confidence in his train-
ing program, and 1 credit all my
improvement as a runner to
him.”

In the time remaining before
the Big East Championships this
Saturday, Ryan will spend his
time continuing to run hard and
preparing mentally for the race to
which he has directed his sea-
son's training.
