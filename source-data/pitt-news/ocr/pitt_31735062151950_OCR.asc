Amos, Rogerspll/ill Lead Grand A
March Atpjunior Proton Tonight

Coed Chainnan. Big Name
Band Break Precedents
For Class Dance

By‘ Melvin Rogow

Today's the day!

The handsome couple adjo_i_n_i_ng
this article will lead a precedent-
breaking dance grand marc_l1 at "to-
night's J u_n_io_r _Pro_n1.

Thyrsa Agliess Amos, C, first wo-
man ,cl1a_irman of any University c_laS.S
dance in history, will lead the march
with Charles W. Rogers, C37, begin-
ning at 11 o’clock.

Miss Amos’ chairmanship is the

first precedent. The second is the
committee’s effort to bring in an A-
Number 1 dance band to satisfy cam-
pus demands. “Red” Nichols’ 17
Pennies more than adequately fill t_he
bill, according to Miss Amos.
. The Redhead’s Columbia Broad-
casting System orchestra 'will be un-.
able to broadcast over a CBS coast-
to-coast hookup because of the sys-
tem’s “previous broadcast con1mit-
ments.”

Broadcast Over WCAE

However, WCAE will carry a
broadcast, beginning at 10:30 o'clock
and lasting for one-half hour. The
Grand March will begin i_mmedia'tely
after the broadcast.

While it is not exactly a precedent,
the corsage favors are something new
with as high-priced a band as “Red”
Nichols. .

Tickets are priced at four dollars.
The event will take place in the Ur-
ban Room of the Hotel William Penn.
The time is 10 to 2 o’clock.

Miss Amos has gathered together
one of the most imposing guest lists
of any University dance.’ Chancellor
John G. Bowman has indicated that
he will make every efi'o1jt_to attend.
All deans of all U_niversity schools
have been invited and will attend.
Most every faculty member who has
been sent an invitation has accept-
ed. An extremely unusual situation,
but, says Miss Amos, “T_l1is will be
an unusual dance.”

Varsity Debaters
Meet Mt. Union
At Lisbon, Ohio

A two-man debate team from-«the
University will travel to _Ll§l_3_Q1_1,
Ohio, Monday, where they will meet
a team from Mt. Union College-in
two matches.

Benjamin Siegal, C37, and William
Stark, C38, will make the trip for
the University. They will first de-
bate the question, “Resolved: That
Congress Shall Be Empowered To
Fix lllinimum Wages and Maximum
Hours for Industry,” at Lisbon High
School.

Their second appearance will be
at a meeting of the Lisbon Branch,
National Grange, where Stark and
Siegal will argue, “Resolved: That
All Electric Utilities Should Be Gov-
ernmentally Owned and Operated.”

The local represen'tatives will take
the affirmative side of the former
question and will uphold the nega-
tive on the latter. They will be ac-
companied on the trip by Charles W.
Lomas, coach of the squad and in-
structor in English.

On Favorable Outcome
Of Victory Parade

Plans for dental health examina-

sion at the first 1937 meeting of ‘the
Student-Faculty Assembly, 'I'ucsdu_v
evening.

E. Ernest Rose, D38, representa-
tive to SFA Assembly from the School
of Dentistry, advocated extension of
the present Student Health Service
examinations to include special den-
tal examinations for all new stu-

The Assembly voted to investiga5..c

Rose, Robert Churchill, C37; Barbara

Fred Smith
To D is c u s s
Occupations

To conclude the series of Vocation-
al Conferences sponsored by the of-
fice of the dean of women, Dr. Fred

C. Smith will speak today at 12:30 ‘

o’clock at Heinz House. .
Dr. Smith will discuss “T-he Status
of Women in Occupations.” At pres-
ent the editor of two mwgazines,
“Vocational Guidance” and “Occupa-
tions,” Dr. Smith is the author of
“Opportunities for Work in a Machine

Age,” which was published in 1934'.

He also holds the position of Aca-
demic Dean of the Graduate School
of-the University of Tennessee, and
execiitive secretary of the National
Vocational Guidance Association.

Dr. Smith’s talk this afternoon will
bring to _a close the first week of the
Vocational Conference, which con-
sisted of three speakers at Monday’s
meeting and _a skit at Wednesday's
meeting.

The second meeting of the confer.-
ence, held on Wednesday, presented
the goodand bad way of conducting
one’s self at an interview.

Anne Fineman of the Retail Train-
ing Bureau acted as the cmployc-r and
explained what defeated each appli-
cant.

Members of Mortar Board, honor-
ary senior wo1nen’s activity frater-
nity, acted as the jobseekers, each por-
traying a definite type. Barbara
Thomas was the bored debutante,
Audrey Graham the “too aggressive,”
and Mary Lou Dowlin-g the “perfect”
applicant, who was hired for the “po-
sition.”

Miss Fineman, in a concluding talk,
emphasized the importance of know-
ing what position one is best suited
for, of conducting one’s self correct-
ly at the interview, and of being con-
ﬁdent of one’s ability.

Coed Engineer-Aviatrix
Flies Plane At Leisure

Spends Much Of Summer At Airport Near Philadelphia;
Questioned About Career, Student Flier Hesitates,
Will Get License, But Foresees Matrimony

By Stella Kaplan

Francis Shapiro, C38, is a woman
of parts.

First of all, she shares with Miss
Lois Joyce, C38, the distinction of
being one of two women enrolled in
the School of Engineering, and will
be gradu_ated ~a _ful1-ﬂedged aeronau-
tical engineer; better still, she pilots

...-p-ane in her spare tir_ne—an
autogiro, ‘to beexactw-anwd will soon
have completed the 40 hou-rs of fly-
ing requisite for holding a private
license.

So, while her roommate is boning
at psychology and philosophy, Miss
Shapiro is busy studying the funda-
mentals of electric, civil, mechanical
and industrial engineering, not to
mention chemistry and physics.

During the summer, Miss Shapiro
does a lot of ﬂying at the Pitcairn
airport near Philadelphia. But the
strange part of the story is that with
all her accomplishments in -the air
and in the realm of technology, Miss
Shapiro has never learned to drive
an automobile.

One of the things Miss Shapiro

:‘ , ,. ‘f,

I . in 1

_suppose,

likes to talk about is her acquaint-
anceship with Major Al Williams, the
famous ﬂyer. “He’s _a very nice
man,” she affirms.

The student-aviatrix is more do-
mestically inclined than one would
judging from the record
;of her achievements in the world
-at large. Asked whethe-r she «thought

_she would find herself an aeronautical

engineer or _a commercial pilot after
graduation _Miss Shapiro with non-
chalance, but not without effect, re-
plied: “For all Ieknow, I may hang
my diploma over somebody’s kitchen
sink.”

Being the only -woman in the aero-

nautical .engineeri—ng branch is lots of

fun, claims Miss Shapiro. She gets
plenty of Vrazzing, she -admits, but it
-doesn’t phase her a hit. As a ma'tter
of fact, she enjoys it.

“When the burly engineers next

-play basketball, Miss Shapiro will be

the mascot, according to good au-
thority. She even wanted to play on
the" team, but her masculine fellow

students decided to draw the line at

that.

German P a c ifis t

At Inquiry Forum

Ernst Toller, German exile of lit-
erary and paciﬁst fame, will discuss
the struggle between “Fascism and
Democracy,” before the semester’s
last meeting of Inquiry Forum, Mon-
day, at 12:30 o’clock, in Room 301,
Alumni Hall.

Toller, whose autobiography, “I
Was a German,” has been widely read
in many countries, was expelled from
Germany by the Nazis, along with
l‘}i11.-."r.ei11, Henrich, Mann and Feucht—
wanger. He has spent six out of the
past eighteen years in prison as a
political prisoner.

After ﬁghting on the German side
in the World War, Toller became a
zealous paciﬁst. Later he founded

the “Cultural and Poli'tical Band of
German Youth,” which had its aims

as pacifism and the abolishment of
poverty. At the end of the war, when
he was only 25, he became president
of the Bavarian Free State.

When Munich was conquered by
the White Army, 'the.new president.
was captured and imprisoned for five
years, most of which were spent in
solitary conﬁnement. During that
time he wrote six famous plays,
among them “Bloody Laughter” and
“Masses and Man.”

After .the success of his first play.
“Transﬁgura'tion,” he was offered
pardon by the government but re-

Student Strikes

WHILST we here prepared to crowd a semes-
ter’s work into three short weeks the stu-
dents out in Wisconsin were on strike because
they don’t like having the governor of the state
make decisions about the personnel and policy
of their school. The students have decided that
they want Glenn Frank as president, and, what
is much more important, they 'haven’t merely
made a decision, they have done something
about it.

Student strikes, despite the annoyance they
cause to peace—loving folk, arc avery he_althy
symptom. They demonstrate a certain, vitality
which we at the University might do well to
emulate occasionally. It is good to take a real
interest in the administration of your school.‘

It is not enough to elect SFA representatives
to elect committees to choose dance_ chairmen.
It is not enough to participate enthusiastically
in pep assemblies. It is valid for students also
to directly challenge their educational facilities.

We should like to add, lest there be some mis-
take as to our point of view,‘that we hold no
particular brief for Glenn Frank. He may have
been genuinely unprogressive in the non-partisan
sense of the word, or he may have been the vic-
tim of a political machine. It may be that, as the
elected representative of the people, ‘Governor
LaFollette is justiﬁed in ousting as the head. of
a university, for which the people pay taxes, a
man whose political philosophy does _not coin-
cide with that of the majority of the people in
his state. As to the pros and cons of the case
we are not competent to judge at this distance.

But the point is that students, too, should have
something to say in the matter. Granted that
we are young and immature it is nevertheless we
who are attending the universities and not the
governors, boards of trustees, boards or regents,
ct al.

Reverbrations
AN ARDENT SUPPORTER and champion of

the Pitt band, good friend to every student,

interested in the welfare of the University of
Pittsburgh at all times, E. V. Babcock deserves
commendation for the many ﬁne things he has
done for this University. 1 i

His recent gesture, the most ambitious testimo-
nial dinner in the history of Intercollegiate ath-
letics, speaks for itself. It not only involved the
expenditure of a great deal ofmoney, but en-
tailed many hours of labor and concentrated ef-
fort to assemble a group of representative Pitts-

burghers. For this and his many previous ges--

tures of interest the University of Pittsburgh
honors, respects, and has real affection for this

trustee. The student body stands behind Mr. Bab-

cock one-hundred percent for all he has done. a .

When Keg1er’s article in Monday’s_ News was
misinterpreted by some to be a‘ “direct slap,” to
quote one person, “at Mr. Babcock’s ﬁne gesture,”
they were no more correct than those in attend-
ance at last Monday’s banquet who similarly'mis-

interpreted, in this case, the purpose of the ban-'

quet. Kegler’s only point was that usually thepep
talks and the “Get-in-there-and-ﬁght,” are left
in the dressing room, to be forgotten after the
last whistle blows. Most testimonial events, he
believes, must, necessarily, be humorous, that
pathos and emotional feats should be left on'the

Rose Bowl ﬁeld in the form of viciousblocking, "

dazzling broken-field dashes, spectacular passing,
and scores.

The story was a “take-off” on a well-known
newspaper writer, as indicated by the by-line, and
"as such was a piece of critical personal writing.

Perhaps Kegler forgot that sometimes when
old cronies gather, they like to blow off excess
emotional steam to take them back to their own
college days when perhaps they, too, were doing
a bit of ball totin’. For that, Kegler may be criti-
cized; but for the other charges hurled at his
typewriter, he has been completely misinterpreted.

1 Short Cuts

O FFICIALS OF THE SYRIA MOSQUE this
week called attention to the fact that Univer-
sity students in going to and from Alumni and
State Halls to the Cathedral of Learning have
been cutting across the vacant lot adjacent to the
Mosque building. This vacant lot is not Univer-
sity property and students therefore who cut
across it are transgressing on ‘private property.
It is to be hoped that those students who have
been guilty in this connection will, in the future,
follow the accustomed, and the time-worn paths
between the various University Buildings.

A Matter of Choice

ONIGHT will mark either the end or con-

tinuance of the trial that brings a “name”
band for a University dance. Red Nichols is the
best “name” band in recent years to be signed for
an evening affair.- It is up to the students
whether they want national bands or are satisﬁed
with local orchestras.

 

 

 rm The Pages Of A

College Man’s Diary

College men, whom I know, do drink liquor,
moderately, much like they attend a movie,
read a good book, play a game of ping pong.
attend a formal dance, or throw a ball down
an alley. It is done leisurely to_ break _the
ordinary humdrum existence of deadlines, re-
strictions, the regular routines. By breaking
down natural inhibitions, occasionally, we
freshen ourselves and gain drive and tolerance
for the work ahead of us.

Restrictions are being broken continually in
our colleges, primarily by those who do not
require such restrictions to guide themselves
in moderation and just plain good sense.

Where do they drink? Well, very few carry
a “bottle,” or openly drink at our University
dances. They either do their drinking before
or after the dance, if at all, and then moder-
ately at a “bar” or restaurant, usually topped
olf with a sandwich, pretzels or the like. I
should hazard that beer and the more formal
mixed drinks are most popular. Very few stu-
dents “tie one on” except on rare occasions of
despondency or celebration, and then only
when there are four or more to appreciate the
motive.

"who drink a highbal-l or cocktail one night, and
wake up the next morning still feeling morally

markably long time for that prohibition and
presbyteria-n hangover to wear off, and it will
be even longer before the last traces disap-
pear. 1 " i ‘
Students, while admitting that there was a
certain thrill in slipping quietly down the cel-

blinds, watch that “admirable” person pour

plain white bottle, appreciate the advantages
of repeal. Not that the stuff tastes an_y better,
but this time‘, it’s just two b.locks down the
street and bright labels and official seals re-
mind you that State Stores do save a lot of

time, and trouble, if you are “old enough.”

Repeal Made StudenfspMore Sane

Hoop-Sl<ir‘l' Era Still Exists

Even today, the dogma of the nineteen-
twenty prohibitionists, built up by hoopskirts
and bow ties of an earlier vintage and mixed
in a smelly bar'roo.jn-,_,.stil‘l has its following.
Those peop1e’_'win__ce at thethought that Edgar
Thompson, w’ithout"his'adrenalinand single
love, that with a prostitute for three months,
his genius would have died with his death;
that Oscar Wi_-lde, without his homosexual re-
lations with an English peer and alcoholic en-
deavors, may never have reached a high poetic
peak. 'The'point is that a normal person is"
not our great person,’ usually. Not that a per-
son must be . a habitual alcoholic to do
great things. Often, he‘ is abnormalin other
ways, for his very greatness makes him abnor-
mal. Can we interpret in writing, for example,
if we can’t appreciate the background that is
responsible for, or has contributed to, that
greatness. But this is off at a tangent, and
far from anything like the conclusions that
we know. ' A

I believe that repeal is accomplishing toler-
ance, to some elxtent, understanding, and’ per-
haps, even appreciation of some things thai
formerly could" not be appreciated. . The mod-
ernalcoholic is a..cons_ervative one, a person
who appreciates that he, as _a normal person,
cannot continue to function at top s-peedor
near capacity without conservatism and a show
of restraint. The abnormal alcoholics, along
with‘ the many other abnormal persons, future
generations will read about, while most of the
modern alcoholics will be known -only as a

class, lost in a shifting, changing worldwith
the rest of the shuffle.  . 1 - ‘

over a bit this way and we’ll tell you
all about it. ~

To begin with, the Irish came to
town Wednesday morning all set for
their game with the Panthers of Pitts-
burgh. The boys from‘ Notre Dame
boasted four straight victories, an all
junior an-d sophomore ﬁve with two
All-Americans sprinkled on the ﬁrst
team, and wins over the Panthers in
their last -two ‘meetings.

mates, -big Paul Nowak and Brown
and Jordairand Meyer.‘ They were
all good, that is, in the ﬁrst half.
'— ~ But came the ‘second half and there
were few of the 4,000 fans present
.who -would vliave‘ risked even that

odds. But the‘ Panthers weren’t
through. Right "off" the reel ‘Billy

points. In fact, all of Carlson’s men
"did alright by the Uiiiversity, there
was Radvansky and Jesko and JOll1'l-
son and ‘Zeleznik and I_“al)el4,a]1(l Rowe

And now, can you see why Ifrish
eyes are not smiling at the game?

Tomorrow night Dr. Carlson and
the Panther men invade Annapolis
for their annual game with Navy's
Middies.“ Navy is, as usual, strong and
has most of the men that whipped
the Panthers last season out there
in Annapolis back agaiii.

To date, the Pitt boys have a roc-
ord of ﬁve wins and two losses, hav-

Philly —Ma,tch.';Marl«:s First
" Meeting Of Pitt, Temple

 

‘ While most everyone else was cat-
iiig ~ breakfast _or taking that last
stretch before'- getting dressed this
morning, Pat Cori-’s swimmers left
by automobile via the Lincoln High-
way for Philadelphia, where they will
meet the Temple swimmers tomorrow
night.

Temple is making its initial ap-
pearan-cc on at Panther swimming
-schedule and little is known of their
outﬁt as they are comparative new-
comers to the intercollegiate water
sport. The nataztors are going out
seriously to annex another victory to
add to their ﬁrs.t of the season over
Slippery Rock, .but.they are .looking
forward-more anxiously to that with
Penn State the following week. A
win over the State boyslvwould be
especially "welcome, settling for the

. present-a little sectional rivalry.

Swimmers Really. Work
This week Pat Corr has been con-

that were initiated last week before
The swim-
mers a-rc still a bit slow in
workouts but they have begun to
pick up lost speed. -Hymie Richinan
and -Bob Keck have been improving
faster than the rest and John Stir-

appointment earlier in the season has
improved so much that he is a deﬁnito
SlJa1‘l;Ol_‘.

Red" McQuillai1 and Bill -Brown
have won their places on the team
through their diving prowess, "but
that is not the only event that makes
the two boardmen valuable assets.
Coach Corr used them both in the
freestyle relay last week and they
gave such a good account of; them-
selves that they ‘will probably appear
in the same event again this week.

The lineup will remain the same
with Tom Locke in the 220 and 440-
yard freestyl-es, Red McQui11an and
Bill Brown in the diving, Bernie Le-
lake in the backstroke, Walt No-
wotiiy in the 100-yard freestyle, and
Toni Anderson in the breaststroke.
