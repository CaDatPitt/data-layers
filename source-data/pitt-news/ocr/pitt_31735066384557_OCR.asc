CAS Council OK's Business Major

By JIM MORRISON ‘
Pitt News Staff Writer

The College of Arts and Sciences
Council yesterday unanimously
approved the “general concept’ ' of
a dual major in business and arts
and sciences.

Pending possible action by the
faculty of Arts and Sciences and
more speciﬁc curriculum recom-
mendations by Graduate School of
Business Dean H.J. Zoffer, the
program will be available to
students this fall.

Under the proposed program,
students would have to fulﬁll the
requirements of the new business
major as well as the requirements
of an existing CAS major of the
student's choice.

The proposed business major
consists of ‘.5 credits in economics,

Complete Canal Pact Essential, Prof Says

By GARY GOVERT
Pitt News Staff Writer

The United States Senate
yesterday approved by a slim
margin the ﬁrst of two treaties
that would eventually give
control of the Panama Canal to
the Panamanian government.

The 68-32 vote for ratiﬁcation
ofthe so-called neutrality treaty
was one vote more than the
two-thirds majority required by
the constitution. Approval of
the treaty followed 22 days of
debate and an intensive lob-
bying effort by President Carter
and other high-level admini-
station officials.

Under the provisions of the
neutrality treaty, the United
States and Panama guarantee
the canal will remain open to all
shipping after it is formally
turned over to Panama on Jan.
1, 2000. In addition, American
warships will have head-of-the-
in case of

States will retain the right to
intervene——using force, if nec-
essary—in order to keep the
canal open.

The actual transfer of the
canal to Panamanian jurisdic-
tion depends, however, upon
passage of the second treaty,
which will be considered by the
Senate sometime next month.

In an interview Thursday
morning, Pitt professor Cole
Blasier, a Latin American
specialist and former State
Department ofﬁcial, said ratiﬁ-
cation of both treaties is
essential if access to the canal is
to be maintained.

“Our unhampered use of the
canal in the next decade or two
is most unlikely without the
agreement of the Panamanian
people,” he said. “Those who
oppose the treaties seem to
think we can continue to use the
canal unhampered if we don’t
ratify the treaties. I don’t think

The canal-some 50 miles
long—cannot be defended from
attacks by well-trained sabo-
teurs, Blasier said, predicting
that such attacks would arise if
both treaties are not approved.

“It’s a nationalistic matter,”
he said. ‘,‘Without ratiﬁcation,
we face long, bogged-down
guerrilla and counter-guerrilla
operations in Panama. But we
have a chance to reach an
agreement that is workable and
enforceable.’ ’

The canal is Panama’s

greatest resource, Blasier said, .

and if the treaties are ratiﬁed,
the Panamanians will want to
keep it open in order to reap
economic beneﬁts provided by
tolls and other fees. In the past,
the United States has kept tolls
very low.

Blasier also said that world
opinion is solidly behind the
Panamanians in this case. Latin
American countries look on the

line privileges
emergency, and the United

that’s a very good prediction.”

SGB Approves New By-Laws

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Revised by-laws for the Student Government Board
were approved atthe board’s meeting ‘Wednesday,
despite lengthy debate which called for two vote
counts before ﬁnal ratiﬁcation.

The initial vote, 4-3 against the by-laws, was
followed by a 90-minute debate beforcz a re-vote of 5-2
in favor.

The two points of debate involved the date at which
the new board may take ofﬁce and the policy dealing

with members who miss more than three scheduled]

boardirheetings during the year.

The new by-laws signify March 1 as the date a new
board may take ofﬁce. In the past, boards have taken
ofﬁce in early February.

Board member Bernie Popko, who voted against
passage, said he believed elections also should have
been moved back one month.

“Elections have continually been snowed out. It
_cuts down the commuter vote,” Popko said.

Board member David Hesidence said the delay in
the inaugaration date allowed for a better orientation
time for the new board, while the old board is still in
power.

‘‘It was an idea that was kicked around for some
time,” Hesidence said. ‘ ‘It makes the ﬁscal year more
concurrent with the board and gives an orientation
time for the new board.”

courses cross-listed between CAS
and the Graduate School of
Business and 14 in courses offered
exclusively by the Graduate School
of Business, for a total of 49
credits.

After attaching several amend-
ments to the proposal, the Council
voted to recommend that the FAS
Council place the matter on the
FAS agenda for future considera-
ti011- take electives.

One amendment passed by the
council seeks to encourage CAS
departments “with a large number
of requirements” to develop
“alternative tracks" that will ease
the overall requirements of stu-
dents in the program.

Other amendments will allow
students to have as their CAS
major either a self-designed major
or a liberal studies major, which

requires at least 30 credits in
100-level courses.

The new joint major was
proposed three weeks ago by FAS
Dean Jerome Rosenberg, and the ~
CAS Council discussed the matter
in its last four meetings before
voting yesterday.

Among concerns discussed was
that the program does not allow
enough freedom for students to

Council member Larry Epstein, a
chemistry professor, said a busi-
ness/chemistry double major
coupled with CAS distribution of
studies requirements would make
up the entire 120 credits needed for
graduation, thereby eliminating a
student’s chance to take electives.

But council member Dee Ashli-
man of the German department,

(Continued on Page 3)

The second point of debate, the dismissal of board
members for continued absence at meetings, was
sparked by a suggestion that a clause be added to the
by-laws stating board members may be excused from
some meetings during the spring session. Hesidence
said such a move would be unconstitutional because
the clause in the by-laws would have conflicted with a
law which is stated in the constitution. Hesidence said
board members should have committed themselves to
year-round board duty when they were elected.

“Spring is a very important time. That’s when the
allocations problems occur," Hesidence said. ‘

Popko stated that some members would have
trouble attending. meetings this spring, due to
summer work or extenuating circumstances. Popko
said the time of the meetings (Wednesday) could
possibly prevent him from attending some meetings.

‘ ‘I would gladly return on the weekends, but none of
the meetings were scheduled on weekends,” Popko
said. “I might not be here to vote on budgets this
summer.”

Both Hesidence and Popko agreed that the
dismissal or impeachment of a board member would
be a difﬁcult process, considering ﬁve votes are
needed for afﬁrmation. A

“It would be very difﬁcult for a person to be

dismissed,” Hesidence said.
“It would create a situation of disharmony,” Popko
stated.

 800 Honored at Convocation

"Q

By CATHY FARNAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt's second annual Honors
Convocation was held Wednesday
at Carnegie Music Hall to recognize
more than 800 outstanding scholars
and leaders among students and
faculty.

Stanislaw Ulam', Ph.D.. an
internationally recognized math-
ematician delivered the keynote
address, “Science in My Student
Day, Now and in the Future.”

Chancellor Posvar was on hand
and commented that “this program
is part of the University’s contin-
uous committment of the recogni-
tion of exce11ence—the excellence
of Dr. Ulam, the keynote speaker,

the excellence of outstanding
faculty, of students and even high
school seniors.”

Posvar went on to cite the
University’s committment of
achievement by initiating the new
honors program of special study for
honor-level students and by the
initiation of events such as the
city-wide high school mathematic
competition.

The program, planned and
executed by the department of
student activities, included Nathan
J. Stark, vice chancellor of the
health professions; Jerome L.
Rosenber, dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences and William H.
Markus, acting vice chancellor of
human affiars.

The Heinz Chapel Choir, under
the direction of Grover Wilkins,
provided the musical selections
during the processional and reces-
sional.

“The program was designed in
part to bring the Unviersity
community together,” Markus
said. “That includes the students,
the faculty and the administration to
celebrate the achievement of all.”

Two special awards were an-
nounced at the convention. The
Senior of the Year award, based on
academic achievement, leadership
qualities and public service, went to
Jerome P. Magone, and the Emma
W. Locke award of $1,000 went to
graduating senior Mary T. Zeis, an
engineering student.

Psych, Biology Heads CAS Majors

By KIM GORDISH

Although the most popular
College of Arts and Science major

(‘ii-at Pitt for the past 10 years has

$'said

  

been psychology, the number of
biological sciences majors has
increased significantly in that time.
In the 1960’s the number of
psychology majors climbed, peak-
ing in 1973 with 17 percent of all
juniors and seniors declaring
psychology as their major.

According to statistics compiled
by FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg’s
office, the number of psychology
majors has declined to 14 percent.

Simultaneously, the number of
biological sciences majors has risen
this year to equal the number of
psychology majors. Although sta-
tistics from CAS Dean Robert
Marshall’s ofﬁce indicate the two
majors are very close, the
biological sciences department
reported 16 percent of CAS

students receive enough
electives by fulﬁlling the distribu-
tion requirement. Other members
said alternative tracks in more
“rigorous” majors would ease
restrictions and allow students
more latitude in choosing courses.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said
he opposed the new program
because it is not consistent with
CAS traditions and has excessive
requirements.

“Two concerns that I have are
that this program requires early

. decisions and that it puts students

into a position of being penny-

pinchers with credits,” Marshall
said.

Marshall said he believes no
CAS program should be too
restrictive and that an ideal arts
and sciences education entails
liberal studies in the freshman and
sophomore years and concentration
on a certain discipline in the
student’s last two years.

Should the program be enacted,
it will initially enroll some 200
students and eventually reach a top
level of 400 students.

“The increase in the number of
life science majors is probably
related to the booming health
professions,” Marshall said.

Students planning to attend a
professional or medical school
account for 62 percent of biological
sciences majors. Also, according to
Nancy Anderson, assistant to the
dean of FAS, one-fourth of
incoming freshmen surveyed plan
to attend a professional school after
they complete undergraduate stu-
dies.

In general, from ‘970 to the
present, the number of students in
the social sciences has decreased
and humanities have remained
stable, while the natural sciences
have shown the greatest increase
over seven years.

Ratiﬁcation at Last

By a one-vote margin, the United State Senate passed the first
section of the Panama Canal Treaty yesterday, taking the first step
toward parting with one of the last vestiges of American im-
perialism.

The Senate’s action means a chance for better relations with the
South American nations, which have viewed United States control
of the canal as a blatant violation of Panama’s territorial
sovereignty. ,_

Besides bettering relations with our southern neighbors, the
treaty promises to better our relations with nations throughout the
world. Closely watching these Senate proceedings, the Latin
American nations especially see ratification of the treaties as sym-
bolic proof of the United States’ willingness to respect their in-
terests, according to Pitt Prof. Cole Blasier, Latin American
specialist and former State Department official. Without the
treaty, many nations would fear that imperialistic mentality that
characterized turn-of-the-century American foreign policy still
exists.

Passage of the canal treaty is the best method to guarantee the
continued operation of the Panama Canal. The 50-mile canal can-
not easily be defended against sabotage, and terrorist activity
against the canal is very likely without ratification of the accords.

“Our unhampered use of the canal in the next decade is most
unlikely without the agreement of the Panamanian people,” said
Blasier.

The part of the treaty passed by the Senate guarantees that the
canal will remain open to all shipping after Panamanian control of
the canal begins in the year 2000, that American warships may
move to the head of the line in emergency situations and that the
United States retains the right to intervene to keep the canal open in
certain situations.

To be considered sometime next month by the Senate is the
second part of the accord that formally gives the canal to the
Panamanians. Without this second half, the section of the treaty
already passed is useless.

To guarantee the future integrity of America’s dealings with the
weaker nations of the world, the Senate shoudl ratify the _second
half of the Panama Treaty. Any other action threatens to destroy
any claim the United States can make to status as a nation whose
policies’ are based on honesty and morality and threatens the con-
tinued operation of the Panama Canal. _

Letters to the Editor

Sports Column Appreciated

I would like to congratulate Jim
Pane and The Pitt News for a
successful effort in the ‘ ‘Time Out”
column. Pane pointed out the plight
of the struggling hockey club, that
autonomous team that continues to
skate despite zero University
funding and many promises. Pane
pointed out that Title IX’s equality
was shaded in favor of women’s
sports while neglecting the icemen.
His barbs and his satire of the
inadequacies of the University
priorities worked.

Two disgruntled writers penned
their complaints to, The -Pitt News.
Undoubtedly, others noticed Pane’s
column. But‘ more important than

the Pitt people who seem to be

looking at the trees instead of the
forest, the article attracted outside
interest and support.

Bill Winstein of The Pittsburgh
Press drew an editorial cartoon
agreeing with Pane’s viewpoint.
Entitled “Terminal Case of the
‘Shorts,’ ” it depicts Cas Myslinski
looking down at the patient—a sick
panther with a hockey stick in a bed.
Cas gives a poor prognosis of a
terminal case.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s
Joe Browne, in his “Our Towne’.’
column on March 3, 1978, wrote,
‘ ‘Darn good article in The Pitt News
by Jim Pane about the shafting the

, Panther hockey team is getting from

the athletic department. Denied

varsity status, the club hockey

members have to pay for every- 

thing—uniforrns, equipment, ice
time, road trips. The team has held
its own against the best in the
country without getting one-tenth
the ﬁnancial aid Pitt lavishes on a
third string football player. There’s
more to a university athletic
program than big money bowl
games.”

The Pitt News sports department
has succeeded in calling attention to
one of our many shortcomings
within the walls of bureaucratic
academe. Hopefully, some action
can be generated for the support of
our hockey club.

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Another national championship
would be great and I’d just love to
have a basketball championship.
Put it this way, let's put Pitt in the
same category basketball-wise as a
UCLA and football-wise as an
Alabama. We’re almost there in
football, so let’s have the basketball
catch up.”
’ So says Bill Hillgrove, WTAE
sportscaster and the “voice of the

5 Panthers” about what he’d like to

see happen in Pittsburgh before he
retires.

Hillgrove ﬁrst joined WTAE in
1967, but didn’t get much
opportunity on camera except for
one weather show.

“Until the University of Pitts-
burgh decided to change stations
for its football broadcoasts, I also
did very little sports,” said
Hillgrove. “We also took the
basketball games and that year
(1969-70) was the ﬁrst time that Pitt
basketball had regularly been on
the radio since 1959.”

In recent ratings, the Channel 4
Action News team has done
exceptionally well and, according to
Hillgrove, “we’ve really eroded
KDKA’s news image in the market

Consumer corner

to the point where we have them
ready to push the panic button down
there.”

Hillgrove, who ﬁnds that as a
great source of pride, thinks one
reason for this superiority in the
ratings could be the way the

two rabbits mating and I had to run
in and pull them apart,” Hillgrove
said’. “Not 20 seconds later, they
were at it again and we had to cut to
an emergency shot.

“Had they not cut to an
emergency shot, the show’s title

administration treats the people at
WTAE.

“We’re treated as human beings,
not as numbers, and we come back
through the set into the viewers
minds as human beings,” he said.

Hillgrove said those people at

WTAE have a lot of fun and some of
the funniest moments come when
Joe DeNardo eggs Paul Long into a
mock argument.
" The funniest moment in Hill-
grove’s. career, however, occurred
when he was a volunteer at WQED
during the ﬁlming of a show about
the children’s zoo.

“Our opening shot was of a box
full of rabbits and we went on live.
Thirty seconds before air time, the
director and I both looked and saw

would have appeared above the two
mating rabbits. The title was
“Recreation, ” Hillgrove quipped.

In addition to his television
sportscasting, Hillgrove is the
“voice of the Panthers, ’ ’ broadcast-
ing Pitt football and basketball
games for WTAE radio.

“Te know that I've progressed
from a little kid who used to sneak in
Gate Three at Pitt Stadium to the
broadcasting booth where I am
today is a personal thrill, ’ ’ Hillgrove
said.

Tying in with these duties is ‘ ‘The
Jackie Sherrill Show,” which -he
co-hosts during football season.

“It’s a beautiful experience to
deal with college-age kids because I
see them come in as freshmen,”

Friday, March 17, 1978-THE PITT NEWS—-Page 7

Hillgrove said. “They're timid,
fearful, won't smile and won't
relate, and I just watch them
develop into beautiful people by the
time they are seniors.”

He cited Elliot Walker as an
example who “wouldn’t say two
words together when he was a
freshman, yet as a senior he was
very nice to be around and he even"
called me by my first name. I like
that!”

Hillgrove’s greatest thrill in his
broadcasting career also has to do
with the Pitt football team and is
obvious to anyone associated with
the program.

“Professionally, to be able to put
on my resume the fact that I was a
broadcaster for a national cham-
pionship team certainly has to be
the highlight," said Hillgrove.
“However, personally, it was very
frustrating because I didn’t get to
call that 12th game, the Sugar Bowl,
because of network ties.”

Hillgrove is a true Pitt fan, even
during basketball season, despite
being a Duquesne alumnus.

“I took off the college sweater as
soon as I got into the business,” he
said. ‘ ‘I’ve lost contact with the
Duquesne people, and since I am so

WTAE’s Hillgrove A Real Pitt Fan

close to Pitt, rooting for them is very
easy. .

“I just like the innocence of the
people who perform on the
collegiate level,” he added. They're
not jaded, they’re out there because
they want to be.”

Hillgrove is very intense with his
feelings on professional sports, and
what he’d like to see happen in pro
sports is “for sanity to reign once
again,” especially in the area of
salaries.

“It’s become insane, and a heck
of a lot of athletes are getting too
much money,” he said. “I don’t
object to a Willie Stargell or a
Reggie Jackson asking for large
salaries because as entertainers,
they’re not overpaid. What I do
object to is mediocre players asking
for great sums of money before
they’ve even proven themselves as
a player.”

While Hillgrove does love
Pittsburgh, he says that if the right
network opportunity would come
along, he’d certainly have to sit
down and consider it.

“It would take a real} y super offer
to even get me to start thinking
about it,” he said. “But I’d be afool
to say that I wouldn’t consider it.”

Bargains in Oakland Parking Vary

By DAVE MCDONALD
Pin News Staff Writer
Oakland: the scene of cars
ripping across three lanes of
steadily ﬂowing rush hour traffic,
U-tums performed in miraculous

fiashion, and dashing cars hurrying

lbfough traffic lights that had long

ago turned yellow. Commuters
learn fast the precision-type
driving of ﬁgure eight drivers after
a few weeks of ‘hunting for a
parking spot in Oakland. To make
matters worse, often after stalking
out that lone space left in Oakland
there stands a ﬁre hydrant or a
driveway entrance.

It is a well known fact that there
just aren’t enough places to park
within the University area. Sug-
gestions have been proposed to turn
the lot between Carnegie and
Hillman libraries into a huge
above-and-below-ground, multi-

‘el parking garage, or to make

F 4 Avenue two-way again and
transform Forbes into a parking
and walking area. The building of
the new parking garage on Forbes
will be a reality soon, but not soon
enough will as large a facility as
those suggested come to the aid of
the neglected commuter.

Since commuters live in the
present, we had better learn to live
with what we have in the way of
parking now. The proximity of the
iﬁrking lot or parking garage to the

“ntral business area or to the
center of campus will determine
the prices the parking operator will
charge. Putting the auto under a
roof will also jack the price up.

Parking in the hospital area
around Lothrop carries the biggest

price tag. The new garage below
the new nursing building charges
$1.75 for four hours and $3.05 for
eight. The open lot directly below
the nurses building outdoes all
other lots in Oakland, charging
$2.75 for four hours of parking and
an outrageous $4.00 for eight. This
lot fills up fast in the morning,
despite the high prices. The garage
between the LRDC building and
Western Psych has parking fees
that are a little more respectable,
charging $1.50 for four hours and
$2.75 for eight. ._

The parking prices in the central
business district don’t exactly put a
twinkle in the commuter’s eye
either. ,

The Medical Arts garage and the
lot diagonally across the street at
Atwood and Fifth both charge
$1.75 for four hours and $2.50 for
eight.

Down at the Forbes Pavilion
prices are $2.00 and $3.00 for four
and eight hours respectively.

Behind the A&P there is a lot
which competes with the one across
from MCNR for the highest parking
prices in Oakland. It will run you
$2.50 for four hours and an
incredible $5.00 for eight.

In South Oakland they keep
parking prices simple. They just
charge by the day. In a lot located
at 3710 Bates, the parking fee is
$2.70 for the day. Most of the
spaces must be taken by monthly
permits which cost $10.

' Across Oakland Avenue, on
Bates, is a larger lot that charges
$1.50 for all-day parking. The
distant lot at 3746 Dawson, which

overlooks Panther Hollow, is also
$2.70 a day and $10 a month.
Getting a little closer to campus
at 315 Oakland Avenue, the two
lots on opposite sides of the street
both charge $1.50 a day. Even
closer is the lot at 239 Oakland
Avenue. They charge $1.75 for all

day parking and $1.00 for’ night,

parking.

Five public parking lots surround
the Cathedral area. In the center of
the campus across from Pittsburgh
National Bank on Fifth Avenue is
an always-jammed lot that charges
$2.00 for four hours of parking and

$3.00 for eight. The two large lots .

behind both the Syria Mosque and
the Masonic Temple charge their
customers $1.50 a day for parking.

If you get desperate there is always
the Carnegie Museum lot that
charges $1.40 for four hours or
$2.80 for eight. Of course, last but
not least, you can always stalk out a
space in the metered lot between
the two libraries. Here you can
pump in enough quarters to give
you up to four hours time. For
every quarter you get 75 minutes.

“Maintain your balance, it’s
very important. Good, good, now
follow through with a punch. That’s
it, now ﬂee! Remember, you are
not the agressor!” said Curtis
Smith, instructor of Pitt's Leisure
Learn Basic Self Defense class.’

Smith, who has been teaching for
a year, has earned various degrees
in two styles of karate, and is a
weapons specialist. He also in-
structs police troops in Pennsyl-
vania and Ohio, and is currently a
silver medal holder in the AAU
nationals of black belt weapons.

However, Smith is now con-
cerned with teaching the basics of
self defense to a variety of
students, who are taking the course
for different reasons. A male
student explained that he took the
course in order to make a positive
move against his own insecurities.
A female student said she was
learning self defense; because she
was so little and powerless.

“We try to instill a quick reﬂex
in women because their ﬁrst
reaction when attacked is fear,”
said Smith. “We want to turn that

-fear into a mixture of quick
reactions and adrenalin. That I

combination can be more effective
than people may think.”

Whether the reasons are of
self-conﬁdence or wanting to be
able to react in the event of an
attack, Smith said this course can
be taught to anyone.

“It doesn't take special clothes,
or even any great amount of

DePaIma’s “Fury” an Orgy of Blood  

’l‘heFury
Dlreet.edbyBrlanDePalma

By RON. L. NYSWANEB
Pitt News Staff Writer

Brian DePalma must not trust
many people. Gauging from his
latest ﬁlm, “The Fury,” the world
is constantly threatening, in-
nocence is just a step from
perversion,‘ and violence a moment
away from each of us.

“The Fury” begins pleasantly
enough. A boy and his father are
having a swimming race at a resort
beach. The sun is high, the water
and beach shine like a post card,
and out of the ocean emerges an old
movie friend—Kirk Douglas, play-
ing the boy’s father, Peter. '
Immediately we look at Douglas’s
famous chin, remember all the
heroes he's been to us in the past,
and wonder what could possibly go
wrong with good old Kirk around.

Suddenly a battalion of terrorists
swarm the beach. Waiters and
tourists are chopped down by
misaimed bullets. The boy is swept
away by a foreboding John
Cassavetes. Douglas survives to
begin a search for his kidnapped
child, Robin.

With his search, Douglas learns
many things, primarily that some
American Government agency is
interested in people with exception-
al psychic ability, hoping that these
‘ ‘special’ ’ individuals can be turned
into powerful weapons. He learns
as well that a school in New
York-—Paragon Institute— is a front
for this agency. From this school
children like his son,. who enter

*nder the pretence of being

subjects for the testing of psychic
powers, dissappear, only to be
turned over to Cassavetes who
heads the agency.

Gillian (Amy Irving) is one of
these special individuals. She_
can pass tests without opening a
book, or run an electric train with
alpha waves from her brain. More
disturbingly, Gillian is so full of
psychic electricity that her touch
causes blood to flow at an amazing
rate. She can deliver a nosebleed or

 

cerebral hemmorhage simply by “

holding someone’s hand.

Gillian telepathically commun-
icates with Robin. At Paragon,
Where she goes for testing, she
receives mental ﬂashes concerning
Robin’s fate, unaware that it might
be her own. Like Peter, and
eventually with him, she searches
for Robin, feeling a bond to
someone who is different in the
same way she is.

DePalma is interested in the

quality of strangeness that plagues
some people, particularly adoles-
cents. His last ﬁlm, “Carrie,” was
about a girl with a gift quite similar
to Gillian’s who is the outcast in her
high school class. Carrie is treated
cruelly and ﬁnally gets her revenge,
but this vengeance destroys her as
well.

Gillian, unlike Carrie, at least has
friends. But she is markedly
different from them. She is
horriﬁed at her power to make

Kirk Douglas takes matters into his own hands in this scene from “The Fury.”
The film is similar to director Brian DePa|ma’s last picture, “Carrie,” and it’s

use of gore.

others bleed, even those she loves,
and refuses to let anyone touch her.
DePalma has created the ultimate
alienation in Gillian—how can
someone survive without touching
others? Remember King Midas?

DePalma introduces other issues
too.By the end of the ﬁlm Robin and
Gillian become murderers, their
apple-pie innocence corrupted by
an agency of our government.
DePalma throws in some references
to atom bombs and war time brain
washing techniques. Perhaps he is
suggesting that Gillian and Robin’s
transformation in not unlike the
making of efficient American
soldiers. “The Fury” also asks
questions about the way “special”
people are treated in our society.
One character states “What this
culture cannot assimilate (referring
to superior people like Robin and
Gillian) it destroys.”

DePalma’s interest in these
ideas, and ours, lasts for maybe ten
minutes in his ﬁlm. DePalma, like
a bored schoolboy, soon shifts
attention to other questions, such:
“How can I make the plot so
complicated that even Howard
Hawks couldn’t follow it?” Or
better yet, “Just how many ways
can I make fake blood ﬂow out of
someone’s body?’ ’ These questions
are not nearly as interesting. After
all, the human body has only so
many oriﬁces and believe me,
DePalma makes blood flow out of
every one of them.

He resolves issues like the
corruption of innocence by creating
his own Darth Vader: Cassavetes’
character, signiﬁcantly named John

Garfunkel, Starlanders Score With New Albums 

AByKEl'lHBBIAN

Pitt News Staff Writer

Watermark
Art Garfunkel
Columbia

The backside of the “V ..er-
mark” album cover looks li‘;e the
Muscian’s Union roster Art
Garfunkel again has dravin on
some of the best talent availa ble tt
produce his latest album. His old
buddy, Paul Simon, horn-blowing
Herb Alpert and sweet baby James
Taylor are just a few who
appear—all in “(What a) Wonder-
ful World.”

This album took over. a year to
produce and Garfunkel handled
that role with the help of associate

producer Barry Beckett to come up
with another soft-sounding pro-
duct.

“Crying in My Sleep” has been
ﬂoating through the radio for the
past few weeks along with
“Wonderful World.” either says
anything important but both are
catchy enough for the AM band.

Jimmy Webb wrote all but two
songs on the L.P., the best one
‘aeing “Mr. Shuck ’n Jive.” The

Eano picks up and carries the tale
.- c*eamers and story tellers; a
piece of ragtime piano in the
middlt ""“"es and blends the two
worlds revealed.

The tile track, “Watermark,” is
the next best out This eerie love
song catches one’s interest and

- independent,

intrigues the listener through it’s
entirety——just as a good painting
does—“caught on ancient canvas
and decaying, disappearing.”

The sound is excellent; clean,
strong and well-
mixed. The music, via Muscle
Shoals Rhythm and hosts of others
is ﬁne. The premium vocalists
listed above, plus the likes of David
Crosby and Steven Bishop, indicate
that no comment is necessary.

A good album——a very good
album—but not as good as
‘ ‘Breakaway. ’ ’

Late Nite Radio

Starland Vocal Band
Windsong, R.C.A.

The Starland Vocal Band’s latest
album is not totally new. Two of the

cuts, “Late Night Radio” and
“Friends With You,” have ap-
peared on ‘previous albums by
S.V.B. founders, Bill and Taffy
Danoff——-the former song on
“Aces” and the latter on a disc
bearing just that name.

Vocals provide the album’s
strongest point. They go up, down,
alternate, quiver, drone, drag,
punctuate and blend like clouds on
the horizon.

The taste of wry lyrics come from
Bill Danoff on the old “Late Nite
Radio” and the new “Man Who
Couldn’t Get Away.” A smidgeon
of “Radio”—“The Lord is still my
sheperd, but them preachers got to

go,”—-and a smudge from “The
Man”——“She tied him up on
Friday to keep him safe for
Saturday.”

“Friends With You” has been
around for a while, but this
recording, done by its authors
probably will put it in the Top 40
soon. The music and melody is
strongest in this tune.

The rest of the album is rather
weak musically, with the exception
of the sax work on “The Man Who-
Couldn’t Get Away.”

But most of the album was just a

few steps above the kazoo
harmonies in ‘ ‘Third Rate Ro-
mance. ’ ’

Second Season Deteriorates Swiftly

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Return of Captain Nemo

,C'BS

If you were wondering when a
“Star Wars” rip-off would appear
on television, wonder no longer.
Despite a few ﬂimsy ties to “20,000
Leagues Under The Sea,” “The
Return of Captain Nemo” is that
same old gallactic warfare, only now
tt’s all wet—in more ways than one.

Jose Ferret, one time Oscar
winner, plays the title role and looks
suspiciously like a damp Alec
The clever little
computerized beings onboard their
ship do a poor imitation of C-3P0
and R2-D2. Lynda Day George tries‘
in her spin-off of Carrie Fisher, but

she’s getting a bit old for these
ingenue parts.

The special effects were better on
“Man From Atlantis” and so was
the dialogue. And that’s not sayin
much. ‘

HavingBabies
ABC

“Having Babies” was originally
a television movie about that
subject. The series is another
excuse for a doctor show with one
guaranteed pregnancy per episode.
Aside from that, the only thing the

movie and the series have in’

common is they are both dreadful.

Another variation of ABC’s
favorite provide-a-showcase-for-
low-grade-series-players V racket,

“Having Babies” is Marcus Welby
updated with a female pediatrician
(Susan Sullivan).

Dorothy Parker once blasted a
Katherine Hepburn performance,
saying the actress ran the gamut of
emotions from A to B. Sullivan
hasn't made it to A. A wooden
Indian in hospital greens might
prove more realistic.

Chuck Barris
NBC

Chuck Barris, the man who gave
us “The Gong Show,” “The Dating
Game” and “The Newlywed
Game” was once conﬁnedto either
daytime or syndication. Some

people can’t leave well enough

V alone.

Barris’s hour-long venture into
prime time is a variety show
apparently modeled after “The
Gong Show.” He's got a line-up of
second rate celebrities who make
their living from being on game
show panels. Actually, it would be a
step up in quality if Barris brought
out Gene-Gene the Dancing Ma-
chine.

Thelncredlble Hulk
CBS

Considering that this show is up
against ABC’s Friday Night Movies
(the winner of the all-time pits
award untﬂ Barris went prime time)
and a new _NBC detective show,

The Incredible Hulk” may just get
by In the ratings. V This is a mixed
blessing.

“Hulk” is based on a comic strip

can say for him. -

with Marvel comics dialogue.
Which is great for funnies addicts
who can’t read. The rest of us have
to watch an hour’s worth of displays
of strength and nonintelligent‘
grunts that is all Hulk does on the
screen.

For those who never read the
history of the Hulk, a scientist
named David Bruce Banner gets
socked with gamma rays and turns
into a hulk of a monster.

The good part of this series is Bill
Bixby, who plays Banner. Bixby
happens to be one of the best actors
on television today and he manages
to raise Banner up from cardboard
dimensions. Lou Ferrigno, who
plays Banner’s alter ego, looks like
a green Arnold Schwartzenegger-—-
and that’s about the best thing you

Violence Only A Moment
Away in DePalma’s ‘Fury’

(Continued from Page 20)
Childress, would murder his mother
if she crossed her eyes at him. He
wears black, and even has a stump
for an arm, topped at the hand in a
leather glove.

The same evil personiﬁed by this
character pervades the world of
“The Fury.” At any point, at any
time, painful, gory violence can
strike even the most innocent of

— bystanders according to DePalma’s

paranoid vision. DePalma offers
one small explanation for such a
nightmarish world—-the passivity of
its inhabitants. All the characters
not directly involved in the intrigue
or violence seem uncaring and
unaware.

To represent this passivity
DePalma drags out a tired
stereotype-—member of the work-
ing class with Archie Bunker’s
mentality. It seems these slobs do
nothing but watch television or
gloat over shiny new cars.

The scapegoating of working
class people is just an instance of
the problem DePalma and other
current filmmakers share. Compli-
cated issues cannot be resolved

 

easily, but it might make for more
interesting ﬁlms if they were at
least addressed, rather than buried
under slick technology or cynicism.

DePalma’s ﬁlm-—with its un-
escapably threatening world, the
almost illuminated colors, and the
dizzying camera movement—blows
up larger than life. It becomes a
cartoon‘, or a “Star Wars” without a
wookie. The questions raised early
in the film no longer matter,
because ﬁnally, none of it—the
gore, the people, the paranoia——can
possibly be real. Even the tension
the film creates is misdirected.
Rather than being worried that
characters we have come to like
might be in danger we worry that we
might have to sit through another
gory, and tortuous scene. The
audience becomes DePalma’s ul-
timate victim.

“The Fury” gets lost in its own
technology and cleverness. This
ﬁlm, like “Carrie,” becomes a
black comedy comic strip. The
audience laughed at the film’s
conclusion: they didn’t buy
DePalma’s vision. Neither do I.

Sherrill Begins Countdown Mi

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer -

With only 152 days left before
the opening kickoff of the 1978 Pitt
football season, coach Jackie
Sherrill will open spring practice
Sunday at Pitt Stadium with two
new assistant coaches and possibly
even a greater respect for the
talents of Matt Cavanaugh.

“We’re better off this year than
we were last year at this time, ” said
Sherrill, “except for Matt.”

The Panthers return 10 letter-
men at the offensive skilled
positions. and Sherrill said that two
major areas of concern during the
spring drills will be working on
“getting the ball to our skill people
and throwing the football.”

The quarterback situation will
have sophomores Rick Trocano and
Lindsay Delaney engage in healthy
competition, and when fall camp
opens in August freshman Danny
Daniels and junior college transfer
Scott Jenner will add to Sherri1l’s
dilemma.

The two new assistant coaches,
Pat Jones and Joe Pendry, join the
staff to replace Bob Leahy (now at
California) and Otto Stowe. Pendry,
a West Virginia alumna, was
offensive coordinator at Kansas
state and his alma mater before
joining the Pitt staff this month:
Pendry will replace Leahy as
quarterback coach.

“In this profession, anytime you
believe you can better yourself
professionally, you’ve got to do it, ”
Pendry said. “I left West Virginia
because I was in a position where I
could better myself professional-

1y’)!

Grappler Gordon Grieves Over

Sports

Pendry, known for his recruiting
prowess, is happy to be on the same
side of the recruiting fence as Pitt
linebacker coach Foge Fazio.

“When it comes to recruiting,
Foge is right up there with the best
of them,” Pendry said.

Jones will handle the defensive
front and was, according to Sherrill,
one of the top young assistants in
the Southwest Conference.

“He (Jones) comes highly
recommended by both Jimmy
Johnson and Don Boyce, and I’m
sure our defensive ends will be in
capable hands,” Sherrill said.

Boyce will take over as offensive
coordinator in addition to his duties
as offensive line coach and Dave
Wannstedt will remain as coach of
the receivers.

Sherrill, who has been known to
switch players to positions that have
been thinned by graduation,
indicated more of the same might
happen this year. Greg Meisner
will be moved from defensive end to
defensive tackle, and the loser in
the battle for the middle guard
position (Dave Logan and Jerry
Boyarski are the main combatants)
will also see action at defensive
tackle.

When the Panthers are not on the
defensive, the job will be to get the
football to Gordon Jones as often as
possible, since it is doubtful there
will ever be too much Jones in the
Pitt offense.

“Gordon has as much ability at

his position as Tony Dorsett had at
his,” Sherrill said-. “Not only can
he do great things with the football,
but Gordon is also outstanding in
other areas, like blocking for
example.”

The seniors will be off the first
week of spring practice, both as a
reward for being seniors and in
order that the coaches can
concentrate all their efforts on the
younger players. The only other
absence of note when the Panthers
take to the rug Sunday will be
Trocano, who is still suffereing from
an ankle injury sustained in the
offseason program.

“If you can recruit ﬁve blue
chippers a year,” said Sherrill,
“you can sustain a great program.”

Among the candidates for blue
chip status this year are Keith
Williams, described by Sherrill as
“the closest thing to Gordon Jones
I've ever seen,”
Jenner and Daniels and a wealth of
big,fast lineman.

“We’ll be very competitive this
year, and we have a chance to be
there (in the Top 10) at the end of
the season.” said Sherrill, “but in

‘I979, I’1lbe a lot more comfortable.

“If I could have just ﬁve people
back from last year’s team, I’d be in
Florida playing golf with those
media people.”

If he had just one, Sherrill would
be looking down the barrel of Pitt's
second nation championship in
three years.

Tanner dismissed the age factor

like a guy telling his family to get
lost while he watched a game on
television.
. “Hey, let me be the reporter and
ask you a question,” Tanner
requested. “How old is Willie
McCovey? And what kind of a year
did he have last season?”

McCovey turned 40 last January.
At 39, he hit .280, with 28 home runs
and 86 RBIs for the San Francisco
Giants. Tanner almost chortled
when the figures were rattled off,
ﬂashing that smile that seems to be
frozen on his face.

“There’s your answer,” Tanner
exclaimed. “And McCovey did it
with two bad knees. He had a great
year. Stargell has two or three more
good years. And he’s the type, that
when his playing days are over. I

The divers must attain a
qualifying score during the season,
then compete in a separate
qualifying meet where the best are
chosen for NCAA competition.

They’ve got to be thinking of the day
when Stargell retires.

But the 228-pound Stargell, the
ﬁrst Pittsburgh playerto hit 400 or
more home runs, insists he doesn’t
think about the threat of compet-
ition ’or retirement.

“I’d like to be available for 162
games,” he begins in that slow,
thoughtful manner familiar to
baseball people. ‘ ‘I don’t even think
about threats to my job.

“I’ll know when I should get
out,” he said. “That’s when you
start thinking about other things.
I’m still thinking baseball all the
way.” A

Pirates’ manager Chuck Tanner,
whose optimism makes a young
Muhammad Ali appear depressed,
predicts a comeback for Stargell,
who missed most of last season with
injuries.

“Willie is going to have a World
Series year, ’ ’ said Tanner, the great
expectation showing on his face.
“He’s going about his job very
»quietly, no to-do. He told me, ‘I owe
you a good year and you’re going to

J’!

3; The Associated Press

BRADENTON, Fla.—“Happy
birthday Willie,” a man greeted
Pittsburgh’s first baseman Willie
Stargell.

“Thanks, ’ ’ grumbled Stargell,
who had turned 37 a few days
earlier.

Handing out birthday felici‘ta-
tions to a 37-year-old athlete is akin
to predicting another snow storm
for the nation’s weather. weary
areas. It’s not too popular..'

But Stargell is ready to prove that
age is simply a state of mind. He
 . . reported to the Pirates’ training

 ' camp in superb condition, looking
ready to start the season.

“I watched everything I ate
during the off season,” Stargell
said. “I worked out a lot, weights
 and exercises, at least 45 minutes
 every other day. That’s all you
"  ' need.”

Stargell is starting his 17th year
in a Pittsburgh uniform, and
probably for the first time since he
became a regular in 1965, he faces
competition for the job. The Pirates’

  Tony is the Guy In Grgurich ’s Recruiting Picture

The Eastern Eight, which at birth seemed doomed
to mediocrity and early euthanasia, is going to make
it. The reason for success will not be even remotely
tied to any league decision; when one of the Eastern
Eight’s governing committees attempts to do
something, the idea of naming a commissioner goes
back to pasture or, worse, the tournament goes back
to Philadelphia. fnstead, this league’s rise will be
fueled almost exclusively by the member schools’

competition-spawned efforts to upgrade their .

programs.
Much of that competition will be waged among
coaches. Among those coaches who remain", that is.

3‘ Less-than-adequate Eastern Eight records become

more than adequate reasons for Penn State, West
Virginia and Duquesne to fire coaches. And while
not every school has aspirations so heady they’ll
make the effort necessary to be a consistent front-
trunner, no member institution will be content to
remain in the standings’ lower reaches for long.

Penn State has hired Dick Harter, a top-ﬂight

' program-pusher, and given him a recruiting budget

so large‘ that if he finds he has been unable to recruit
himself into national prominence after spending
most of the money, he still will be able to make his
way to the top by bribing high school hotshots with
the cash that is left. I

West Virginia, despite protests from Morgantown
to Cincinnati, would consider it almost heavenly
were Gale Catlett——and big-time basketball-to
return to WVU. Catlett is considering it.

Duquesne is faced with a spend-or-die decision;
John Cinicola, suspected cause of a condition that
looked like gangrene to Dukes’ athletic director Red
Manning, was amputated and the rest of the patient
on the Bluff has a prognosis of not good. ,

Pitt is somewhere above all of that bott0m—of—the-
league bloodletting. The Panthers’ main worry, in

  

fact, is with bringing folks in and not with throwing
them out.

The Panther coaching is more stable as it has been
at any time since Buzz Ridl served as classy captain of
a program that had perhaps the best assistant coach
in the country, Tim Grgurich. Grgurich, after three
tumultuous seasons, has settled down and seems
comfortable inshis position for the first time in three
years. Fran Webster, in charge of the defense, still is
a whiz. And Cleveland Edwards’s all-round assist-
ance has been a blessing in the past year, especially

’ since he replaced a man who, it has been reported by

Pitt insiders, used much of his time to create more
schisms between Grgurich and his players than 21
losses ever could.

Pitt’s coaches have a fair amount of talent to take
with them into next season—Wayne Williams recen-
tly underwent knee surgery that was reported to be
successful, Ed Scheuerman will lift some weights and
attempt to add some pounds, Sam Clancy will help
Pitt basketball merely by staying alive for another
season—but it is plain they need more. And Tim
Grgurich has his eyes on a kid who may be more than
enough.

Tony Guy, currently leading his Loyola high
school team through Maryland’s basketball playoffs,
is a 6-6 answer- to many of Pitt’s needs. He
probably will determine whether Pitt has an excellent
recruiting year or a mediocre (at best) crop.

Street and Smith’s yearbook placed him on its pre-
season all-America squad (fourth team). Grgurich, a
friend of Guy’s coach, Jerry Savage, has placed him
atop Pitt’s list of hoped-for high schoolers.

Guy is so good he has the Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic courting him at a time when most seniors
gladly would exchange their shooting arm for a
Roundball equipment bag. Sony Vaccaro, the
Roundball’s talent surveyor, is fighting the Mc-
Donald’s all-star game for Guy’s presence.

“I don’t have his (Guy’s) statistics for you,” said
whomever it was that answered the phone yesterday
at the athletic department (The team was in Cum-
berland for the tournament) of Towson, Md.’s
Loyola High. “But I can tell you that Jerry Savage
and Pittsburgh’s coach are real good buddies, and

they’ve been in almost constant contact about
Tony.”

Also contacted have been local players Rod Scott
of Northgate, 6-ll Skip Brown of Keystone Oaks
and 6_-l Jim Gissendeimer of Clairton, who’ll play in
the first game of the Dapper Dan doubleheader on
March 21. Doug Arnold (Norwin) and Bruce Atkins
(Wilkinsburg), the Pittsburgh area’s best big men,
apparently are headed out of state. Pitt made a large
pitch for Arnold, but he is reported to be headed for
North Carolina State (Duquesne still holds hope of
landing him). Atkins, who never was courted concer-
tedly by Pitt, will most likely play for Marquette,
though the Dukes also are still in the running.
