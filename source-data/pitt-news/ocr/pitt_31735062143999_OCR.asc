P A Wee Squirrel On The Whirl;
 “Squeak” Was Quite The Girl

By Jim Pettican

usher discharge, however.

5.

’»‘.."’

7 Pittsburgh friends of Alexa alias “Squeak” will be glad to hear
he precocious little squirrel has ﬁnally settled down back home in

Jamestown, N. Y., to play around her owner’s house and, perhaps,

dash off a memoir or two.

Alexa is remembered here at Pitt for a

little incident which resulted in her dishonorable discharge from the
United States Army. Not that Alexa ever cared about the status of

Alexa’s story began on the day
she was found in the woods near
an Air Corps ‘camp at Greensboro,
N. C., by PFC. Eugene Ericson. In
nothing ﬂat, Eugene and his ﬂy-
boy pals had adopted the little
bundle of gray fur and named her
Alexa. As any other female would,
Alexa grew and prospered under
the lavish attention of so many
men, and, on the day, her master

‘as sent to Pitt, he employed a
gde pocket and a few tactful
inks at his sergeant to bring her
along. Alexa didn’t take to trav-
eling so well and became train-
sick enroute. _

After arriving at Pitt, however,
a ‘visit to a veterinarian put her
back on her feet and she was

ready to start enjoying campus
life. All went well until one night
when Alexa scampered away from
PFC Ericson as he was busy tend-
,ing to those thousand and one
tasks which all self respecting air
cadets have to do. Her little jaunt
took in three ﬂoors of the Cathe-
dral, and the climax came when
her furry feet scattered a certain
isY1ajor’s valuable papers to hither
and yon and back again.
That episode resulted in PFC

named the squirrel Squeak“ She
also discarded her army dogtags
as a further aid to her retreat
into obscurity. PFC Ericson’s
younger brother, Norman, 15,
adopted Squeak and built her a
three-foot square cage of wood
and mesh wire. She lives in it
when she isn’t occupied in chasing
around the house, eating her fav-
orite fruit (bal‘,?‘x‘1'3.S), or gobbling
up choice r.w‘meats.

During l"fl‘ Cl" days, Squeak be-
came so accustomed to the ways of
civilization that she never learned
to eat nuts and still can’t manage
them. She is so civilized she plays
with a rubber ball around the
house, kicking and rolling like a
playful kitten. Cats and dogs shy
away from her. She’s much too
civilized to suit them.

There was one bad moment
some time back for Squeak when
the State of New York saw fit to
question her status as a civilian.
After hearing about her dishonor-
able discharge, the State wasn’t
quite sure her papers were in or-
der. Thus, she was entitled to
only a six months permit to live
in a private home. Everything
came out all right though when
the Ericsons appealed to the local
game warden on her behalf ex-
plaining that she would die if
turned loose. This resulted in:a

Festival Prizes

‘Announced

At Dance

Awards for Spring ‘Festival com-
petitions were announced Saturday
night at the closing Mardi Gras
ball.

First prize in the costume pro-
cession which opened the. festival,
Wednesday, went to the AEPhi’s
for an upside-down man. Smoe,
the ZTA’s creation won first hon-
oble mention. Miss Mary Taylor
Walton’s orientation class and the
Tri Delts won second and third
honorable mentions. The judges
were Miss Harriett R. Glasser, as-
sistant to the dean of women,

Reid Hastie of the fine arts fac-
ulty. _

The Sigma Chi fraternity won
an orchid for its “Sweetreart Hat
of ’46,” an entry in the hat con-
test at Thursday’s outdoor bar-
becue. Second_ prize, a wishing
ring, went to the Pi Lams, and
third prize, an oversize cigar, went
to the SAE’s. Guests Al Noble
and Ed Hufnagel acted as judges.
The prizes were gifts from Tom
Brenneman of Hollywood.

The annual ﬂoat parade was
based on the thing sororities would
like to see at a New Orleans Mar-
di Gras. “The Birth of the Blues”,
by AEPhi, won ﬁrst place. The
Tri Delts’ version of the French
Quarter was awarded second prize.

r T’livird«.pri'ze: W-ent to the.~.»TPA’s -buc-_

caneers. A bird’s-eye view of the
Mar-di Gras won an honorable
mention for the Phi Sigs.

IF prize winners were the Phi
Gams, who totaled the highest
number of points in the track

~ meet and sweepstakes.

In the women’s athletic events,
WAA won the chariot race. The
Tri-Delts’ chariot was judged the
best decorated entry. Alpha Kappa
Alpha won the track meet.

“We hope everyone had a lot
of fun at the Mardi Gras,” said
chairman Bicky Feldman. “Stu-
dent co-operation and faculty as-
sistance made it one of Pitt’s most
successful festivals.” A

Financial co-ordinator Alice So-
ﬁs beamed, “Besides, we made
money.”

Summer Bulletins

Available May 20

The preliminary summer session
announcement, which contains the
schedule of classes, will be avail-
able Monday, May 20 at the Sum-
mer Sessions office, 2701 C1.

According to Dr. Frank W.
Shockley, director of the summer
sessions, the program announced
in the bulletin will be essentially
that which will be offered during
the summer semester, although
there may be some minor changes.

‘There has been no hot water
from the ground ﬂoor to the
fourth ﬂoor of the Cathedral of
Learning -for the past few
weeks because of necessary
thermostat repairs. Hot water
cannot be expected until cer-
tain parts are delivered. No ex-
pected date of arrival for the
parts can be predicted, accord-
ing to John S. Lapp, engineer
in the department of building
and ground.

Because the water system of
the ‘building is divided into four
"separate sections, hot water
can be supplied to the upper
ﬂoors.

Each year before the editor of the News turns over his re-
sponsibilities to the new editor, the ‘custom is that the out-
going editor take a last ﬂing in expressing himselflor herself
on any annoyances or gripes he or she may have, and to make
any suggestions or. recommendations if felt necessary. Thus,
here follow some general criticisms and suggestions that‘ may
be taken’ for whatever they are worth to those concerned.

First. The News throughout the past year has carried
numerous editorials,-features, and news stories, urging more
student spirit at Pitt. We, of the staif, feel that we have been
successful to a certain extent. The student body is now to be
commended for its ﬁne attendance and participation in the
Spring Festival events. We feel that the success of these affairs
were at least partially due to the promotion and publicity given
them in the News. Also, we pride ourselves in fulﬁlling our
purpose on campus as an official publication org.a.nizat‘ion in aid-
ing the English department to sponsor the writing conference
that was held on campus recently. -

1 However, we sincerely hope that the administration heads
have taken notice of this upsurge in activity and participation
on.both the side of the student and faculty. We hope, too, that
it will impress upon them the need that activities on campus
have far more ﬁnancial backing so as to improve themselves and
return to normal functioning. In other words, bluntly, we are
asking the administration to “loosen up with University money.”
While we would not like to see our University run on an over-
generous basis, we would like to see the administration appro-
priate to activities more ﬁnancial assistance so that our campus
activities do not lag behind those of other schools the same size
as Pitt. For example, a university with the enrollment of ours
is in deﬁnite need of a newspaper with more issues per week.
However,.with engraving charges and printing materials rising
in costs the News, which is not ﬁnancially capable of paying all
expenses itself, is desirous of having an appropriation to aid in
the costs of printing, circulation, etc. Likewise, such organiza-
tions as the Owl, Pitt Players, etc. will need backing if they
are to continue as activities on campus. Now, we feel that the
administration should note this return of high enthusiasm and
spirit to such groups which had to struggle to exist through the

_war days, and We believe that the administration should give

us the aid we ask for so that we can move forward on as larger
and more satisfactory scale. In the long run the University
will receive valuable publicity for Pitt from these activities.
Second. There is another need existing in a University of
our size. That is——a radio shop or broadcasting system. This
could be established within the Cathedral and regular programs
broadcast at certain hours throughout the day. We have tech-
nical students to handle the mechanics and we also have talent
to do the organizing, write the scripts and do the announcing.
Better practical experience for future radio work could not be
gained while in college than through a set-up like this. Faculty
supervision should be given only in an advisory capacity so as
to let the students use their initiative to the fullest extent;
Third. Next year, there will undoubtedly be the usual
politics on campus. It is hoped that by that time the"-'U~ni-versity
will quit frowning on this type of activity and that candidates
for office will be given the opportunity to make statements. con-
cerning their platforms; and that campaigns will be openly

sponsored by the various parties concerned, and lastly, that the
l\.ews be the organ used to announce these stands to the student
body. Here again, 1S an _excellent opportunity for students to

e obtain practice in expressing themselves on politics which we

all realize are an important part of our democratic way of life.
1 Remember that we get out of things only what we, our-

Vet GI Zette

By 33284396

The other day it was suggested‘
to this writer that it was about
time fellows stopped being vet-
erans and settle down to a normal
civilian life and attitude. Not a bad
idea but—that person who made
the suggestion was a girl and had
not been in the service. Whether
that is important or not is beside
the point; We were in complete
agreement but resented hearing
that remark. And anyhow. here at
Pitt no‘ one seems so acutely
aware of any differences in status,
which is as it should be. There will
always be a few individuals any-
where you might go who will
spend the rest of their lives
dwelling on the fact that they

were veterans and exploiting that
fact to their advantage and» to
everybody else’s discomfort.

The average vet we believe, is
perfectly willing to forget that he
has experienced a war. Differences
are created by other people as wit-
ness the remark of our feminine
friend of the above paragraph.
This writer in a surge of altruistic
idealism refused to wear his dis-
charge pin because he felt’ that
the wearing might embarass some
boys who, through no fault of their
own, were not veterans. However
in the course of a short walk one
day, to a bar incidentally, we
were the object of a few rather
pointed comments. Next day the

middle column.

The . student hostesses at the
University of Pittsburgh who serve
as guides to visitors to the Na-
tionality Rooms are eligible to be-
long to an honorary society known
as Quo Vadis. This group is com-
paratively newly organized since
it was not until the fall of 1944
that it was oﬁicially recognized on
campus.

Quo Vadis has pledged itself to
create public opinion and student
participation sympathetic with the
ideals symbolized in the National-
ity Rooms at the university; to in-
still an understanding of the inter-
dependency of nationalities one
with the other; to foster an under-
standing of the culture and socie-
ties. of the individual nationalities
of the world.

To be eligible for membership

would be willing to discard his

be interesting to former Air Corps
men. William Allen White’s “Auto-
» biography” should be of interest
to everyone. _

“Vedanta for the Western
World,” an explanation of Hindu
philosophy; “The Story of the
‘Stars and 'Stripes’’’; “Dryden, a
Study of His Poetry”; “Navy

the United Nations” are more of
the new crop.

Telephone Lines

The University telephone lines
are badly overcrowded, and it is
not possible at the present time
to obtain additional lines._It is ur-
gently requested, therefore, that
members of the faculty and of the‘
University staff refrain from mak-
ing or receiving personal calls.

Men Students
Given Trip
To Europe

Men college students are being
given an opportunity for a free
trip to Europe and $150 in cash
on their return by the United Na-
tions Relief and Rehabilitation ad-
ministration.

UNRRA is now making regular
shipments of livestock to Greece,
Albania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and
Czechoslovakia. To handle the
cattle and horses being sent, live-
stock attendants, otherwise known
as “sea-going cowboys,” are need-
ed on each ship. Each attendant
will care for approximately 30
animals. V

UNRRA’s goal is to deliver ove
200,000 animals to Europe before
the end of the year. To do this,
more than 30 UNRRA ships will
be sailing monthly with over 900
attendants aboard. Sailings gen-
erally will be made from East
Coast and Gulf ports.

.The length of the trips will
vary with the ship. Some ships
have made the round trip in five
weeks, others taking eight or nine
weeks. The amount of time spent
in Europe also varies. Some men
have had as much as two weeks
time. Opportunities for sightsee-
ing exist to some extent, depend-
ing on where the ship lands.

Any male college student inter-
ested may secure additional infor-
mation in the YMCA ofﬁce.

Called To Study

Education

CHICAGO, ILL. —— ACP——The

University of Chicago has invit-
ed 18 colleges and universities to
co—operate in a study on general
education. The planning confer-
ence will begin next fall. During
this conference they plan to pool
their various founts of information
in order that they can better
study education.

The memorandum on such a co-
operative project in general edu-
cation is as follows: Developments
during the last few years have
greatly intensiﬁed national inter-
est in general education. The ex-
perience of a number of colleges
and universities in trying to pro-
vide programs of general educa-
tion has resulttd in fairly com-
mon agrement on the answers to
certain questions that are raised
in the process, of developing such
work.

There is common agreement that
the purpose of general education is
to provide the education necessary
for the intelligent layman and cit-
izen. There is also common agree-
ment that a major part hi the ed-
ucational emphasis through the
fourteenth grade should be upon

Do You Rate—- T N T

By George Polimus

After surviving the rigors of
Spring Festival, particularly the

I-F track meet, yours truly scur-
ried around to the various frats
and came up with the following
bits of knowledge. First off on the
list are the congratulations_to be
given to Theta Chi on their ac-
ceptance into I-F Council thus
making that body eleven strong.
Also the Theta Chi’s number twen-
ty since they have pledged six
more since spring rushing. Moth-
ers’ Day teas seemed to be the
vogue this last week-end as the
Delts and Pi Lams respectively
had their mothers over for tea on
Sunday. ’Tis rumored that Dean
Rush was the guest of honor at
the Pi Lam affairs. Senior ban-
quets also seemed to be in fash-
ion as the Phi Eps will honor their
seniors at a banquet dinner dance
this Saturday at the Fort Pitt and
the Pi Lams will honor their’s to-
night. Election results from the
lion’s lair of SAE are as follows:
Budd Steffens, president; Peter
Homich, vice president; Paul Cor-
coran, secretary; and Gerald Al-
and, treasurer. Ed Shumaker and
Frank G-allo celebrated Spring
Festival as newly initiated broth-
ers of SAE. Out at North Park on
Saturday afternoon the pledges of
PiKA will hold their annual brawl
for their respective big brothers.
While on Wallingford Street that
same night the pledges of Phi Gam
will honor their big brothers with
a pledge dance. On Friday night
some lucky sorority from BTC
will be the guests of the Phi Kaps
at a dessert dance. (Probably look-
ing for new ﬁelds to conquer!) And
now to close t-he column with the
ﬂash that the Delts look forward
to big things at their Spring For-
mal this Saturday at the Alcoma
Country Club. Have fun boys’.

By Terry Tracey

Fraternity women, enjoying a
welcome breathing spell this week
after a gay and successful Spring
Festival celebration, are conclud-
ing their activities and planning
for their ﬁnal social affairs. ADPi,
which has recently opened its new
chapter house, will formally ini-
tiate its pledges on Saturday after-
noon, and hold its Founders’ Day
banquet at the College club in the
evening. Delta Zeta proudly an-
nounces that its own Pitt chapter
is the winner of the DZ National
Scholastic cup. More power to
you girls!

The AEPhi’s, deserving victors
of the Float Parade cup and Spring
Festival procession prize held ini-
tiation and luncheon for their
pledges at the William Penn Hotel
Sunday followed by a tea in honor
of Mothers’ day. The SAE’s hon-
ored the TPA’s at a dessert dance
Thursday evening. Theta Phi
Alpha has scheduled its senior
dinner for May 28 at the Roosevelt
hotel where entertainment by the
actives andipresentation of senior
gifts will be part of after-dinner
ceremonies. Last weekend was a
busy one for Chi Omega with its
Mothers’ tea on Saturday and its
Alumnae tea on Sunday.

The Phi Sigs honored their
mothers at a banquet at Hotel
Schenley Sunday with a special
tribute to Doris Kalmenson, Senior
Queen.

The annual spring formal, this
year on June 8, is the up n’ com-
ing event-at the Tri Delt house
these days. The Vogue Terrace
will be gala Friday evening with
the advent of the Beta Sig spring
formal-.. Also industriously plan-
ning for their spring formal are
the Phi Mu’s. The date is May
17; mark that one with a red pen-
cil!

IT'S

 

As A Date?

By Jim Pettican

Being fresh out of proﬁles and
caught short of gossip, we de-
cided to run a poll this week. After
all, Dr. Gallup has been living too
serenely lately so we felt like do-
ing some [Pitt style polling and get-
ting him all worried again over
competition. While we may not
have anything to shout about, we
do have something to poll about—
said something being a subject
both intriguing and interesting.
Curious? Well, our thesis is “Are
Pitt Gals Hard To Date?”
(Ed. Note: Don’t laugh, we’re se-
rtous.)

With this question in one hand
and a slightly rusty piece of lead
pipe in the other, we went from
corner to crevice and lawn to lawn
interviewing interviewees. (After
all, is there anything else one can
do with this interviewees?) Al
Roth, a junior, told us, “It depends
on the particular girl. Some of
them are frigid and others are-
ah frantic.” Hank Daley express-
ed deﬁnite tastes. He said, “I like
a good true down-to-earth type of
woman. Here at Pitt, the gals are
too frivilous and frothy. They
think they’re cosmopolites but
they’re really parasites”-—this last
was accompanied by a wry smile.
Why a wry smile? Well, someone
forgot to put sugar in the tea one
afternoon last week.

Hercules Schmaltz, a third se-
mester freshman, is rather non-
plussed about the whole idea. Said
Hercules, “Once, during my eight
years at East Afemenon high, I
had a date for the junior prom. I
had to back out at the last minute
though. Seems it was formal, and
shoes always give me a penned—in
feeling.” “Well, have you had any
dates here at Pitt?” we asked
him. “-Naw” he answered, “Nary
a one,” and pattered on down the
hall. So the answer as to whether
or not Pitt gals are hard to date
depends on several factors. The
factors, according to reliable
sources, include, how handsome
you are, how tall you are, what
kind of car you have, how many
greenbacks you keep on your per-
son, and who you are on campus.
If you have a high rating on all
these factors, then you can get ‘on
the nearest phone and swim right
into the social swirl. If you lack
someof them, well, here’s a nickle.
It won’t hurt to take a chance any-
way.

Pitt Flying Club
There will be an important
meeting of the Pitt Flying club,
Monday, May 20, in room 132
Cl at 12:30 o’clock. All mem-
bers please be present on time.

    

By Teddy Termite

It all happened because of the
No Corsage Policy and the fact
that I wanted to do right by my
favorite woman for once. Every
time we go to a dance, some of
the chicks are wearing Corsages in
spite of the aforementioned policy,
and this puts me in the doghouse.
So, last Saturday being our last
big dance I decided to get her a
Corsage and get it inside the ball-
room somehow. With the aid of
Ameche’s favorite device, I got a
connection with a friend of mine
named Smoochie ‘The Smuggler,
and arranged to have him smug-
gle a lush -array of extra fancy
Flori-da tropical dandelions into a
little alcove adjoining the ball-
room. He then gave one of his
stooges written orders for accom-
plishing the mission. The stooge
showed up that night at the ap-
pointed hour and slipped me a flat
package. I thought it rather odd-
ly shaped for a corsage but gave
it to my gal anyway. She opened
it, something unmentionable fell
out, and, well, I just can't talk
about the rest. The next day, on
the Ameche, Smoochie told me
that he never could spell very
well, and just hadn’t realized that
corsage ends in a-g-e. Therefore,
the stooge had gotten what he
thought the paper said. (Although,
I heard later that he had a heck
of a time ﬁnding one made in Flor-
ida). So now my babe won’t speak
to me, I’m facing social ostracism,
and I’m the not-very-proud own-
er of something I can’t possibly use
—all because of the No-Corsage
Policy. Would any of you-er stout
girls care to bid for this bit of
surplus property or do you ﬁnd
Ry-Krisp more effective in the
long run?

on May 25-26.

In the in-itial affair, this afternoon, the locals will play host to
Geneva, West Virginia, and Carnegie Tech in a quadrangular festival
ticketed for Pitt Stadium. Originally, it was intended that this meet
be an invitational carnival involv-9 5

ing almost 20 schools in the tri-
state area. However, most of the
smaller colleges h-ave not, as yet,
revived track into their spring

program, thus narrowing the ﬁeld

to four contestants.

The Panthers should encounter
little difficulty in ﬂoating oﬁ with
top honors in this afternoon’s fea-
tures, having already tumbled
Tech with its reserve squad while
the Tartans own two triumphs
over Geneva in a s_et..of meets held
on a home and home basis. West
Virginia will _initiate its season
with this meet._

In the weekend winder-up, the
Olson tutored Panthers will again
take on Tech in a three-sided af-
fair involving Oberlin college. The
Ohioans have yet to score a vic-
tory in 1946 outdoor competition.

‘Carl Ovlson’s weightmen were

greatest collection of shot putters
ever assembled in non-champion-
ship competition when they in-
vaded West Point for the trian-
gular tussel with Army and NYU.
On hand for the Battle of Behe-

have pushed the 6—pound pellet

Illinois’ Han-dy Andy Phillip,
who can be counted upon to give
Pitt’s basketballers a lot of trou-
ble when they meet next season,
once tallied 101 points in an in-
dependent game. His team won
the rout, 2012-17. Add to the list
of things that will never happen
again: In the 1905-6 -basketball
season, Pitt’s ﬁrst, the ‘Panthers
were smothered, 30-4, by Penn
State.

close to 18 points per game. They
even won one tilt, dumping Ge-

lac-ing at the hands of Navy, ‘last
week, returns to Pittsburgh to bat-
tle Carnegie Tech, this afternoon,
at 3:30 o’clock, on the Tech courts.

The match with Carnegie Tech,
this afternoon, will ﬁnd Pitt fav-

' have played before and Pitt won

handily, 8-1. The Pitt boys have
a record of one won and one lost,
now, and are conﬁdent of taking
Tech again.

The match at Meadville, Satur-
day, with Allegheny, will again
ﬁnd Pitt favored to win, since Al-
legheny is yet untested. Allegheny

The Panthers will close their

home season at the Stadium this

afternoon when they battle with West Virginia’s Mountaineers in the

second of a two game series.

(The result of yesterday’s West Virginia-Pitt game must be
omitted from this week’s News edition because of the Monday dead-

line.)

The Mounties, who at this writing own a record of four won and

none lost, will present a formida-9

ble outﬁt headed by shortstop
Johny Fox, a member of the ﬂashy
quintet that walked off with dis-
trict basketball honors this past
season. On the mound will prob-
ably be Okey Ryan, a freshman
righthander who has looked plenty
good this season.

The Panthers will ﬁeld a re-
vised line-up in hopes of produc-
ing more punch at the plate.
“Pappy” Jim Kline, who became
the proud father of a bouncing
baby boy on Sunday, will move
into right ﬁeld. Jack Smodic has
been shifted to center and Gen-
nock remains in left.

Coach Ralph Mitterling will
probably call on Sammy David to
do the hurling. In his last Sta-
dium start the Bridgeville fresh-
man limited the Salem Tigers to
three hits.

The probable line-ups:

WEST VIRGINIA PITT
Jochum, 3b Gennock, If
Fox, ss Kline rf
Birmingham, 1b Smodic, cf

Game time is 3':30. Stadium at-
tendances, which have been sur-
prisingly low all season long,
could be vastly improved by a
large student turnout this after-
noon.

ﬁrst inning, and the usually relia-

> Due to the lack of manpower during the war, colleges through-
’t out the United States set aside their set rules of athletic eligibility
land compiled new ones. The new rules allowed all freshmen to play
[I varsity ball in their ﬁrst year. i
. Now that the war is over the floor coaches in the larger univer-
g sities wonder whether or not their schools will again adopt the old
code.
At Pitt this problem is being tossed around. As rumors go—
Elmer Lipp,"Geneva college basketball player, is contemplating com-
; ing to Pitt in the fall. Lipp is supposed to be a Pre-dent at Geneva
 and intends to get his D.D.S. degree at Pitt Dental school. Now if
Lipp is accepted to the Dental school will he be able to play for Dr.
t Carlson?
' _ If the old rules on eligibility are re-adopted he won’t be able to
play. The rules permit an athlete to compete in one year of Fresh-

man sports and three years of varsity competition. l;ipp has com-
pleted his three years of varsity play.
If Lipp happens to come to Pitt and is permitted to play
basketball all well and good and if he isn’t permitted to play
basketball no one will shed a tear.

Clark D. Is Right on Top

A visitor in Pittsburgh several weeks ago was Clark Daniel
Shaughnessy, former Pitt grid coach. Shag was in the best of spirit
and happy to betrid of the title of head football coach at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

At the University of Maryland where Shag has been teaching
his T all looks very well. He has approximately 50 good ball players
to work with plus a university athletic bank account totaling in the
millions which Curly Byrd, Maryland’s president, intends to use to
put up a huge stadium.

When Shag said, “Maryland will have big time football before
Pitt,” maybe he was right. But I wouldn’t bet on it. Here is a
sure bet. Shag will accompany the Redskins here when they
play the<Steelers. He wants the pleasure of beating Jock Suth-
erland and I’ll bet he gets it.

WAA Drops
Soft Ball
Scheduling

By Marilyn Pearle

The women’s events in.Friday’s
stadium review lived up to WAA’s
expectations what with spills:
frills, and a victory for the asso-
ciation itself. V

The ﬁrst event, the hoop races,
found Martha Johnson of Alpha
Kappa Alpha burning up the cin-
der path with her stick and hoop
to come in ahead by about two

lengths. AKA’s reward was a
miniature loving cup to decorate
their trophy shelf.

Ann Livingston of WAA came in
right behind Martha to take away
second honors in the event.‘ She
won a little toy dog for her effort.

WAA ran away with the chariot
race both literally and ﬁguratively
and the five phys ed girls proved
themselves worthy of their major.
The Tri Delts were not to be out-
done, however, and the girls put
up a good, stiff race to come off
with second place in the race.

WAA’s winning team was com-
posed of Ruth Ann Burke, Peggy
Dailey, Olga Sekerak, and Doris.
Bufﬁngton who did the leg work.
and Ruth Descaunets who did the
riding. The girls won a snappy
Pitt pennant for their prize.

The Delts were given another
little loving cup and also won a
tiny house bell’as their reward for
having the best decorated chariot
in the meet. The class of ’48
showed up with a cleverly decor-
ated wheelbarrow but were dis-
qualiﬁed because the race was for
spruced-up wagons only.

Majors Plan Softball Game

The phys ed majors decided to
hold a softball game among them-
selves this Friday morning at
Shadyside ﬁeld. ‘ The remarkable
thing about the game is that it is
scheduled for the unbelievable
time of 7:15 o’clock (in the morn-
ing, that is.) Any major is eligi-
ble to sign up but beware for those
who sign up and do not show up
‘will be ﬁned ten cents by WAA.
Tennis Continues

.WAA has decided against sched-
uling softballsince the end of the
semester is so near at hand, and in
its place tennis will continue on
until ﬁnal exams begin. Matches
will be held every Tuesday and
Thursday from 11:30 to 2 o’clock
at the Trees gym courts. Any

girl is eligible to come out for ten-
nis so long as ‘she provides her
own raquet and at least one prac-
tice ball. '

ART BARNES

He’s from Verona

Arthur Barnes
Star In Pitt
Diamond Bell

By Dick Johns
The most promising ball player
on this year’s Pitt Panther nine is
Zlyear old Art Barnes. Art has

proven in his past 5 games for
Pitt, that this 261/2 month hitch in
the Naval Air Corp. has don-e no
harm, since he is hitting and ﬁeld-
ing as good as ever."

Art is very versatile, proving
this, not only by batting from
either. side, but also by playing
shortstop or second-base with
equal ﬁnesse. His versatility has
been a great aid to Coach Ralph
Mitterling and the Panther coach
has taken full advantage of this
break. The recent Penn State game
furnishes an example. Mitterling
was forced to bench young Don
O’Rourke, the regular shortstop,
because of his failure to connect
at bat; so he shifted Barnes from
second to short and used veteran
inﬁelder, John Wasiecko, at sec-
ond. This move, in noway de-
creased the efﬁciency of the inﬁeld
and promises to furnish more
power at the plate.

.Art played sandlot ball in the
Pittsburgh district for seven years
before hisentrance intothe Navy
in 1943. He served as an Ensign
Pilot during the war and while in
the service, he played for the
Chapel Hill Pre-Flight school and
the Bunker Hill Naval Air station.

Barnes graduated from Verona
high where he participated in var-
sity football and basketball; they
do not play baseball» at Verona.
But Art played baseball on the
sandlots and eventually, various
big league scouts came down to
look at him. He received offers
from ‘Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and
the Boston Redsox. Then came the
Navy's call. ’ '

Now that the war is over, those
offers are still good, but Art has
refused them to ﬁnish a c-ourse in
accounting, here, at Pitt.

the meet were the ‘officials, asked .
by George Weekes-to help, out for I

this event. Prominent among these
men were Mr. Ebert, who did‘ a
ﬁne job of running the track
events, and.Dr. Green, Dr. Mills,
Mr. Oermann and Mr. Mitterling.
‘These men did a great job getting
the individual events run on time
without _much confusion. V
- The meet was won by the Phi
Gams with 39 points, although
they took only two ﬁrst places of
the ten events. A -close second were
the PiKA’s with 311/2 points, with
three ﬁrst places, and following
them» were the SAE’s with twenty-
four. The Phi‘ -Delts were fourth
with 19% closely. followed by the
Delta Taus with 19. In sixth-
place were the Sigma Chi’s with
17 points and in seventh the Phi
Eps and Phi Kaps were tied with
seven points‘ each; Eighth and
ninth’ places went to the Alpha
Phi’s and the -Pi Lams with six
and ﬁve points respectively.

ofﬁce is the ﬁne showing of can-
didates for the I'M wrestling
crown. Outstanding ‘among the
matmen are Kalmanir, who has al-
ready won his first match, and
Hayhurst of the Phi Gams, who
is competing for individual honors
on the mat. Weekes is proud of
“his” men and hopes that a few
more muscle-men would show in-
terest in wrestling ‘com-petition. Up
to now, the boys haven’t complet-
ed the quartfer-ﬁnals,‘-~so there is
still time to enter this week.

The golf results haven’t been
turned into the Athletic Director"s
oiﬁce, -but talk around the golf

course has ‘it. that a certain fra- .

ternity man, competing individ-
ually, has shot a .70 on the Schen-

Arguments, pro and con, selﬁsh

and unselﬁsh, have been raging _

in these‘ ivy-covered halls of
learning over this suggestion until
it threatens to disrupt beautiful
friendships and become an obstacle
to the common’ college romances.‘
Accusations have been made that
women go to college only in Search

of a male; women fall back on

or “They gave 4' ‘years for you,
can’t you give 2 years to them?”
Then we can institute a “Leave
College Week” for women.

Advertisements can appear in
leading magazines showing a co-
ed shaking hands with the vet-
eran who is taking her place, and
quite often it is the same guy
whose place she took in industry
a few years ago.

Women veterans are in an en-

viable position. They are both vet-
erans and women. They would
have a decided corner on the “man
market,” uninterrupted and with
no competition. At least there
wouldn’t be much trouble picking
a queen for the coronation dance.

not too far-reaching. Perhaps high

’ THE WORLD'S MOST HONORED WATCH

 

      

OR YEARS, the Japanese main_-
tained a tight hold on the world’s
camphor supply.

Americans had to have camphor
in ever-increasing quantity for the
manufacture of photographic ﬁlm,
celluloid, plastics, perfumes, medi-
cines, lacquers and disinfectants. But
they were forced to pay whatever
price the Japanese chose to ask. And
even at 1919’s exorbitant top ﬁgure
of $3.75 a pound, they were never
sure of a full supply.

Men of Du Pont undertook to make
this country independent of such an
unsatisfactory source. They knew
that camphor could be synthesized,
but to make it at low cost and in
large quantities was an entirely dif-

‘ ferent matter. Long years of experi-
ment and research produced little
but disappointment. But ﬁnally, in
1932, a way was found to produce
low-cost chemical camphor on a com-
mercial scale that matched nature’s
product in color, texture, scent and
usefulness.

are offered a synthetic musk that is
of a determined strength, immedi-
ately usable and as powerful as the
pure essence of natural musk.
