Carrie Hoover carried a puppet
into last night’s Student
Government Board meeting. She
said it helps keep her morale up
during the election week. ’

Hoover, the chair of the
Elections Committee, is running the
second University-wide election in
two months. ‘

The firstelection was for a ref-
erendum to change the time of
SGB’s tenure; Wednesday’s will
decide who will fill that four-month
board.

Hoover’s puppet — a rabbit in a
hat —— helped her give her commit-
tee report detailing some specifics
of the election, including voting
booth locations and theirhours.

She encouraged studentsto vote
in Wednesday’s election, which
includes three presidential candi-
dates and--l2 board candidates.

Students will be able to vote for
five board members to fill the eight
positions. To vote, students must
be non—CGS undergraduates and
have their Pitt ID.

President Joan Snyder also
announced at last night’s meeting
that Provost James Maher had
announced approval for funding to
renovate student offices on the fifth
ﬂoor.

Currently, many groups have
cubicles there, but there is no open
work space and some groups have
outgrown their space.‘

Snyder said that construction to
move cubicles, ‘ add rooms and a
work space would begin as early as
Thanksgiving and be completed
after the break in December.

“I think it’ll be a great addition
to this building and encourage stu-
dent activity here,” Snyder said.

“This will allow us to have group i

events, like organizational pride
contests.”

The Environmental Committee
announced that the l8~gallon recy-
cling bins are being given. out to
students at Recycling Week events.

‘this’ week, including at ‘tables in

Towers lobby and a free concert on
Thursday night. - .

Interested students will‘also
have a chance to take a field trip to
BFI Recycling Center, which han-
dles recycling for Pitt.

The race for the

presidency reaches the courts

Yesterday, the road to the White House finally
went through a court house. ~ 

The emergency hearing filed by the Gov. George "

W. Bush team to end the manual recount in four
Florida counties ended in favor of the Democrats
when a Florida federal judge ruled that there was no
“irreparable harm” in a recount, denying the Texas

,govemor’s request. The Bush team is expected to

appeal that decision.

' The Democrats though, also took a big hit when
Florida’s secretary of state announced that all ballot
certifications must be in by 5 p.m. today. Any votes
that are not returned by the deadline will not be
counted.

' Palm Beach county now has 25 teams counting

14 hours a day, and they do not estimate to finish for ‘

another six days —— way past the deadline.

Vice President Al Gore’s team filed suit, request-
ing an extension. A judge will rule on the request at
10:30 a.m.

« At 3:30 p.m., _Warren Christopher, leading the
Gore team, said that enforcing the Tuesday deadline

. in light of the fact that absentee, ballots won’t be‘ _

counted until Friday, is “arbitrary and unreasonable.”
He said that the Republicansecretary of ‘state was

’ contributing to, “partisan politicsff.  -

'_ Now the dispute betweeini ‘Democrats and
Republicans over counting 'the"bal~lots-by hand‘ grows
more heated. The Bush team is accusing Democrats

/of only demanding recounts in highly Democratic
counties. They also say that manual recounts are sub-
ject to personal opinions.

The Gore team claims that it is only asking for
recounts in states where there have been problems.
Supporters also have noted that the machines are
unreliable because when a ballot is not completely
punched, the machine counts it as unpunched,
whereas the human eye wou1d~catch the irregularity.

At 4 p.m. yesterday, Gore told reporters that he
wants to ensure “that the votes are counted, and
counted accurately.”

He wanted to tell America that this is “not about
a contest but about our democracy.”

“I would not want to win by a few votes cast in

-works and how important it is to vote.

error, or misinterpreted or not counted and .I don’t
think Governor Bush would either,” Gore claimed.

He finished by saying that_the “saving grace’? of
the events of the past week is that students are learn-
ing fifsthand how the American presidential process

‘After he ﬁnished, he was bombarded with legal
questions, but he smiled, said he would make no
comment and walked back insidethe White House.

Last night, Broward County decided not to con-
duct a manual recount. A _

Also yesterday, all five lawsuits concerning the
controversial “butterﬂy” ballot were combined into
one motion and the hearing was set for 3:30 p.m.
yesterday. It is still unknown what the result of that
hearing was.

The outcome could decide the Republican strat-
egy in the following weeks. ‘ D‘

But should Bush decide to challenge results from
other states, he now has a limited amount of time to
do so according to a report by the Associated Press.

Bush has until this Friday to seek a recount in

, Pitt’s‘ second Faculty Honor Roll
recognized 28 inﬂuential teachers,
including the late professor Reuben
Slesinger at a ceremony yesterday
afternoon. _

_ Slesinger was nominated inithe
spring for the honor roll, but died
Oct. 30. His widow, Natalie
Slesinger, accepted the award for
him.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
opened the Student Government
Board—sponsored ceremony.

He spokeof teachers’ inﬂuence
and informed the audience that he
considers himself a teacher p“first and
foremost.” He reminded teachers that
they will never know where their
inﬂuence will go, and that they have
clearly touched the lives of their stu-
dents.

“We all do salute you,” he said. .

Nordenberg remarked that stu-
dent recognition is the most “gratify-
ing and inspiring” recognition of all.

Joan Snyder, president of SGB,
and board member Dave Lander wel-

‘ coined the audience and explained the

purpose of the Faculty Honor Roll.
Lander said, “We’re here today to
honor an outstanding group» of peo-
ple.’’
He quoted poet William Butler

‘Yeats and said, “Education is not the

filling of a pail but the lighting of a
fire.” '

He. then commented that the hon-
orees had all “lit fires” in the minds
of their students, and that the honor
roll was the students’ way of saying
“thank—you.” .

Lander also explained that the
honorees did not necessarily have to
be professors. ~- i

“What sets these people apart is
that they have been able to inspire,”
he said.

Kajal Varshneya and Rae Dorer,
Academic Affairs Committee co-
chairpersons, then announced hon-
orees. V

Students Tom Wyant, Erin
Lindeman and Brett Buzzini were
present to announce the teachers they
nominated.

Wyant, who nominated history

. professor William Chase, explained

that he ‘wanted to be able to thank

Chase inperson and to give him a0

face to which to attach the nornina—
tion. 5 .
“It’s a little more powerful,”
Wyant said. ' '
‘After the

three _ students

announced their specific nomina-
tions, Varshneya and Dorer alternated

announcing the names of the remain-

ing faculty members.

When they finished, Lander
thanked them for attending and
announced Slesinger’s award, which
his wife accepted. I

The petite woman, clad in black, V

approached the podium and accepted
the award. Fighting back tears, she
shook hands with the chancellor and
kissed his cheek. . _

Lander reinstated the Faculty
Honor Roll last year, and told _the
audience of the role Slesinger played
in that reinstatement. Prior to last
year, the last such ceremony was held
in the 1930s. ' i ‘

Lander also read a letter of nomi-
nation for Slesinger, which praised
most highly the professor’s accessi-
bility, which the student called, “most
important to me.”

After the half-hour ceremony
closed, Mrs. Slesinger said that-she
was proud of her husband, but very
emotional about the matter. '

She said that she knew about his
nomination to the honor roll,‘ and that
she was not very surprised to learn of
his special award.

“He’s had so many awards. He
left quite a legacy. Pitt was his life,”
she said. ‘ g . ‘

Mrs. Slesinger also said, “I’m

thrilled to be here. I’ll put this on a"

wall with his other honors. He would
be so thrilled with this. He would be
the proudest.”  A ' .’
The other honorees also enjoyed
their recognition.
Chemistry professor Peter’ Siska
said he was surprised and pleased.‘

“Honors from students arebetter _

than any other kind,” he said..

Erika Cederstrom, also from the
chemistry department, said that . she
felt the nomination was very encour-
aging. -

“Last year was my first year, and

it was kind of hard to keep everything

together,” she said. »
Lander and Varshneya comment-

ed that they felt the ceremony was A
well-attended despite the fact it was

held in the middle of the day.

Lander said that he felt this .year’s
ceremony went more smoothly than
last year’s. ,

He also explained that any facul-
ty member in the University can be
nominated for the honor -roll, regard-

less of ‘whether they actually teach a.

class. '

.“Wil1 anyone offer me more
than $26 for an evening with Gary?”
asked auctioneer Pete Stopp.

T Lothrop p _Hall’s Resident
Director Gary Sokira, was the prici-
est catch at Sunday night’s resident
assistant auction in Lothrop’s
lounge at a final sale of $30.‘

RA Eve Slanovich coordinated
the event, part of the ongoing
“Lothrop Challenge,” the hall’s
annual charity fund‘-raising pro-
gram. Sokira and Slanovich joined
12 other RAs on the bidding block,
including Lothrop President Kerri
Meeks and Student Government
Board presidential hopeful Mike
Unangst.

With music ranging from the
“Rocky” theme song to “Oh Yeah”
by Yello to LL Cool J’s “Doin’ It,”
Stopp introduced each RA. He

_;described ’particijpVant’sl ‘respective

majors, some of their interests and
the special services they would per-
form for the highest bidder.

Every bidding started at a mini-'

mum of $2 and rose at 25-cent
increments. I V
For the average price of about

~ '-$4.25 (excluding Sokira’s nprice),
Lothrop residents could purchase an

«RA or two to do their laund’ry,’clean

papers, rearrange their furniture,
vacuum, help with homework or
deliver food for them. A
Seventh floor RA Larry Johnson
would “troubleshoot your PC, move
furniture or give you a massage”
and second floor RA Unangst “Will
do anything for the highest bidder!”

- Sokira was the gem in every bid-

der’s eye, offering to take the high-
est bidder or highest bidding group

_ to eat off-campus.

A little shy of an hour, the auc-
tion accumulated a total‘ of $91.75
for charity. ‘

Stopp said, “I’m glad we raised
as much as we did for the charity
this evening. I’m glad I could help

_out by auctioning everybody out.”

Slanovich also made programs
and signs, advertised and helped
make the background CD for the
auction.

“I’m so excited that I bought
Mike Unangst,” sophomore Alison
Soldano said. A

Unangst said, “I think the event
was really cool — something fun ——
[it] gets everybody involved.” V

Questioned about how he felt
purchasing Slanovich, her boyfriend
asked, “Eve, how do I feel about
buying you?” ’ V _

Slanovich answered, “A cuter

' won.”

EDITORIAL
SGB election endorsements

Against a backdrop of confusion,
recounts and court cases spurned by the
national presidential race, the annual
Student Government Board elections
are set for tomorrow. There is one key
factor to consider when voting this year
—future SGBteIrnswillbegininthe
summer instead of the winter.
Therefore, the candidates elected will
only serve four months, as‘ new elec-
tions will be held in the spring. Thus the
elected must focus on speciﬁc goals in
order to make progress in such a short
amount of time.

With this in mind, The Pitt News
endorses Mike Unangst for president
Unangst clearly has the necessary expe-
rience; he has been involved with stu-
dent government throughout his experi-
ence at Pitt and served as business man-
ager on this year’s board. Perhaps more

importantly, Unangst recognizes the’

fact that his term would be a mere four
months. In response he has pinpointed
attainable goals, such as increasing stu-
dent participation in SGB by moving
meetings to a more accessible location
such as Litchﬁeld Towers.

For board, The Pitt News endorses
the following: .

- Rob Brown is enthusiastic, has
served on two SGB committees and
prioritizes such essential values as unity
and communication.

- Sara Dadlani has worked with
the U.S. StudentAssociation and is pre-
pared to use methods of grass—root

organization to put ideas into action.

' Jay Dworin’s platform of mak-
ing SGB more accessible to students,
accountable for the proposals it prornis—
es and more reﬂective of our diverse
student body will give SGB the kick it
needs.

- Rob Loper focuses on speciﬁc
issues, the most important of which is
his idea to update archaic registration
processes, toward the goal of bringing
online registration to our campus.

- Stephan Nikoloif proposes an
intelligent and feasible way to increase
student participation — form focus
groups to work with SGB on such
issues as food services, campus safety
and off-campus Internet connections.

- Rebecca Normand emphasizes
safety issues, proposing the notion of
installing emergency call boxes in
North and South Oakland, instead of

just on campus.

0 Joel Thurston has compared
Pitt’s student government system to

those in other universities and offers the

idea of forming a student senate. ,

- Desiree Williams is an involved
student who astutely considers diversi-
ty from a ﬂesh perspective, believing
that it goes beyond the issue of race and
instead involves people’s interests and
cultures. .

With many qualiﬁed candidates to
consider, take time to vote tomorrow.
We can only hope there won’t be any
recounts.

promises of campus improvement. Inevitably,
bridging the student government-student body
communication gap will be among this year’s
promises. And if you’re a bit cynical like me,
you’re probably not likely to buy into this one any
more than the 24-hour I-Iillrnan library promise.

So listen up, SGB candidates! Let’s try to
aim for some goals that can be easily achieved
and built on, starting with this fun-
damental communication issue. ’

Let’s be realistic —— public
meetings and forums, though they

are a step in me right direction and CONTRlBU'l‘lN(; EI)I'r0R

should be continued, are just not
reaching enough students. For example, consider
SGB’s most recent scandal, and see how some
small changes could have helped the situation.
Last month, SGB held a referendum to
change the election cycle. Not only were most
students completely uninformed about the whole
event, but an even greater number were com-
pletely bewildered by board member Dave
Lar1der’s objections. Most of the debate about the
referendum took place during public SGB meet-
ings, and unless students made a regularpractice
of attending these meetings, they most likely
missed the whole discussion. '
Simply stated, students’ lives are busy. There
needs to be another way of disseminating infor-
mation — the Internet. A ﬁilly functional SGB

Web page would have provided an easy way for ,

students to research the referendum, as well as
supplying a forum for Lander’s objections and
student debate.

The SGB Web site, _www.pitt.edu/-sgb,
should better utilize its space and be expanded to
contain any and all information pertinent to SGB.
This will allow for 24-hour access to information,
encourage SGB accountability and counteract

student apathy. »

cial Web master position. This way, new respon-
sibilities would not be placed on the board mem-
bers orthe SGB president, butthemaintenance of
a more complete SGB Web site could be ensured.

It is unlikely that ﬂie position would be hard to ﬁll.
There are plenty of infonnation science, commu-
nications, computer science and computer engi-
neering majors at Pitt capable and interested in
building their resumes.

Currently, the SGB Web site is virtually_not .

maintained. There is space for minutes from
board and committee meetings, biographies of
board members and the president and a calendar
for campus events. None of these spaces are frilly
utilized —— for example, only the biographies of
president Joan Snyder and board
members Lander and Jonathan
Hoﬁman are complete. '

interferes with SGB’s accountabil-
ity, making it difficult to ﬁnd out
what the board and committees are up to, espe-
cially if a person cannot attend the meetings. The
site’s totally unused spaces give the impression
that SGB is giving students ﬂie brushoif.‘

In addition to’ getting those biographies 'and
minutes up to date, SGB should also create space
on the site for SGB candidates’ biographies. This
would help both candidates and student voters —

it would be ﬁee campaign space for candidates '

and easily obtainable information for students. ‘

SGB might also consider putting its alloca- .
tions online, something that Carnegie Mellon ,,

does. I think doing so might end some of the con-
tention as to where our ftmds go. It’s money ﬂiat
we, the students, pay and we should know and
care about where it goes. -

Also, it would be convenient if download- '

able versions of SGB forms, such as those for
allocations, were to appear online. .

A The list of things SGB could and should
include on the site is lirniﬂess.

SGB candidates: Hear my plea — these are _
‘small changes. For the most part I am asking you

to use resources already available. By utilizing

your Web site, you can reach out to many more .

suidents than you can with a couple meetings.
Please, bridge the communication gap — for
real this time.

Diving deep  

“Men of Honor”
Directed by George Tillman Jr.

tit

ROBERT DITTMAN
Staff Writer

Triumph against impossible odds has always
been magic for Hollywood. Adding military or
sports—re1ated related heroism to the mix, is a

_nearly automatic recipe for cinematic suc-
cess. When filmmakers are lucky
enough to come across a true
story, it only heightens the«sus—
pense.

Classics have been created
using this formula. Add to this
list “Men of Honor,” the new
Navy elite—diver flick.

“Men of Honor” takes place in  -
the rural South, specifically Sonora, Ky.,
in the late 1940s and early 1950s. One of many
areas where racism flourished, people there
believe in heroes, hard work and doing the right
thing. But they also believe that heroism has to
be packaged in white skin or it’s immediately
suspect. Carl Brashear Jr. (Cuba Gooding Jr.)
learns this the hard way. "

 

 
  
 
  
  
 

We first meet
Brashear as a kid on a
poverty-ravaged farm.
His father is a share-
cropper who knows
that no matter how
hardhe works, life will
never be any better. He
wants more for his son.
Soon young Brashear
decides that he wants
to become a master
Navy diver and leaves
the farm.

Before he earns
his place in the deep
with other Navy
divers, Brashear has to
deal with the likes of

crusty trainer and
Master Sgt. Billy
Sunday (Robert
DeNiro), who, like
everyone else in the
Navy, believes that

blacks belong in the
galley. With Brashear,
Sunday has .the unenviable task of admitting the
first black enlisted man into the barracks.
Almost immediately the rest of barracks leave in
protest, not before leaving a savagely racist note
taped to Brashear’s bed. I

Director George Tillman Jr. navigates a high
profile cast to tell this story of overcoming
impossible odds. He does a remarkable job of
re-creating the intensely racist atmosphere of a
1952 New Jersey Navy training yard and the
people that populate it.

In DeNiro and Gooding we do not watch
merely heroic stereotypes, but multi-dimension-
al characters forced to face their own shortcom-
ings. Once again Charlize Theron (Gwen) plays
a vulnerable but tough character that many

actresses would turn into a stereotype. As
_Sunday’s wife, she has to cope with
- both the heroic Master Diver
and the son of a bitch, both
personas planted firmly in

one person.

It would be difficult to
watch “Men of Honor” and
not be inspired —— we scowl at
the narrow minds of the key

characters, but then wonder how far we
have come. We can forget the film’s weaknesses
and cheer its message. Award—winning screen-
writer William Goldman once remarked, “A
movie is made up of moments. If there enough
of those [memorable] moments, we say it is a
good film.”

So it is with “Men of Honor.”

Crushworthy

 

J enniter Mecaiello

I have a crush. It’s not a big deal, and I don’t
expect anything to come of it, but it’s the first
crush I’ve had in a long while, so I thought I’d
share.

I know, I know, he’s too old for me, but he
plays the guitar and sings in a rock .‘n’ roll band.

He wears leather pants and writes power ballads’

and sells out arenas.

He’s so cute.

I saw him on Sunday, and he made me blush
with almost every word that came out of his per-
fect mouth. He was wearing this funny beret, but

it didn’t matter because his hair still looked great. “

I actually got a little choked up when he played
this one song, ‘but I hid my face so myvfriends
wouldn’t see. -

He’s married, and I respect that — I would
never break a marriage apart. He danced with
another woman on Sunday, though, so maybe
there’s a chance for me. He even kissed her on the
mouth, which made my stomach feel like it was
on fire. 1

I’ve had this crush on and off» since I was in
first grade or so but never did anything about it. I
Wasn’t allowed to see him back then —— my mom

and dad wouldn’t drive me and be the cool par--

ents who let me explore my feelings for this boy.
I, didn’t let it hold me back —— I had other
boyfriends and grew up. I was never hurt by him,

like I’ve been with other boys, never had a fight I
with him or been put down by him or cried

becausehe broke my heart. —

Even so, I’ve missed out on holding hands
with him, making mix tapes for him, and going to
the movies with him. And kissing — I definitely
need to make up for lost time in that category.

I’m tired ofhiding behind excuses like age,‘

proximity and stardom. I’m ready to say this, and
I hope, by some small miracle, he reads today’s
paper. ‘

p In geometry, the definition of a
line contends that a line is merely an
idea which continues indefinitely in‘

~ two directions and precedes time and

place. —

Besides his prolific works of writ-
ing, film, plays, music, opera and
painting, French artist Jean
Cocteau also drew. His
simple sketches consist
of“ ﬂuid lines which, the
viewer may imagine,
extend beyond time and
place and have inﬂu— .
enced scores of artists of
all mediums. ' ' ' .

Standing in the Andy Warhol

’Museum, the viewer immediately

understands Why a body of Cocteau’s
work is on display in this museum:
‘significantly inﬂuenced
Warhol and" multiple.‘ parallels
between the two artists andtheir work
exist.

Both men were, of course, prolif-
ic artists and both experimented in
similar realms of expression.

\

   
  
 
  

TI-IEPITTNEWS

Both dabbled in the performance J

medium — Cocteau with his plays
and films, such as “The Two-Headed
Eagle” and" “The Beauty. and the
Beast,” and Warhol with his Velvet
Underground. '

Both men were also openly homo-
sexual. Collections of their work con-
tain similar sketches of young boys,
and in Cocteau’s case, boys portrayed
as mythical fauns. The two-artists also
drew and sketched, and it is here, in
the assorted ink and paper sketches,
that the audience can most easily see
the similarities between the two
artists.

Warhol and Cocteau drew with a
seemingly simple, yet elegant ﬂuid
line, which casually meanders around

the subject, simultaneously capturing

and freeing space. Their drawings
demonstrate a strong control of nega-
tive and positive space and both
artists implement it to
J their benefit.

Regardless of
his medium,
Cocteau drew to
express and define
his thoughts.

“Drawing
‘ greatly amuses me. It’s

a relief when I’m writing, or not
writing,” Cocteau once said.

Should Visitors to the exhibit feel
the urge to create/produce something
artistic, they can visit the yellow room
adjacent to the main gallery. Here

-they may listen to recorded works of

Cocteau, thumb through books by and
pertaining to the artist, or sit down at
a desk and write a letter to a friend,
which the museum will mail.

.ties between his work and Warhol’s,

should re-familiarize themselves with
Warhol’s work before they indulge in
and fully appreciate the arts of Jean
Cocteau.

are fascinating. Visitors to the muse-

Farm ly un It
Meet the Parents
DreamWorks Records

tit‘!

ERIC LIDJI
Staff Writer

When labeling albums, there is
rock music, jazz music, R&B music
and funky, upbeat, happy, get-up-
off—your—ass—and—dance music. The
soundtrack for “Meet the Parents”
goes under the last category.

It is the latest work of first—rate
film composer Randy Newman.

Newman has been nominated for 13
Academy Awards, but has yet to
win one. Still, that’s doing just fine
when you consider that he is a con-
temporary of John Williams who
has been nominated 38 times and
won five. .

I do not think Newman
will get nominated for
Best Original S_core
(though he might have
when there were two cate-
gories, one for comedy and
one for drama), but “A Fool

in Love,” the only original song,
should get nominated for Best
Original Song.

“A Fool in Love” is a humorous
song that has been stuck in my head
since I first heard it. It has a great
bongo beat and some fun lines:

 
  
  
   

“Show me a man who’s gentle and
kind/And I’ll show you a loser/Now
show me a man who takes what he
wants/Oh how exciting.”
Newman has a great voice remi-
niscent of some of
the old jazz
is i n g e r s
of the
‘ 4 0 s
a n d
‘50s
deep, rich

recognizable.

It’s too bad he only sings three
songs on Meet the Parents. The
other two are the Fats Domino song
“Poor Me” and “Got My Mojo
Working,” originally by Muddy
Waters.

After these three songs come
the score, and, like most good ones,
the songs all mesh together to cre-

songs make you want to “get on
up,” the instrumental ones are good
for relaxing or studying.

The album ends with three older
songs, “I’m Your Puppet” per-
formed by Bobby Womack, the
original recording of “Ya Ya” by
Lee Dorsey and “Big Chief,” sung
by_ Dr. John.

Newman has won critical
acclaim for his work in films like
“Avalon,” “Pleasantville,” “The
Natural” and “Ragtime.” In 1996 he
was awarded the first - Henry

achievement in film music. .

Knock Down the Walls

; Currently student government is
unable to adequately represent the changes
in our student body and our needs. This is
due to the lack of information available to us
in terms of administrative policy and student
government action. In addition, lack of
communication between students, student
government, and the administration leaves
no one to hold accountable to our needs.
My vision of Student Government is a center
of campus activity in terms of change on our’
campus. These issues are ever changing as
our needs change. In my three years here, I
have yet to see adequate steps towards the
kind of Student Government that I want to
represent me. I am running in thelhope that
Student Government will one day be the
place where real issues are addressed and,
more importantly, real victories are won.
Student Empowerment is the key
to taking steps towards this vision of Student
Government. , Student Empowerment comes
from Responsibility, Accountability and
Modernization’. The board members must
be held Responsible to the students who
elect them. Through a monthly publication,
produced by Student Government Board,
students will have an opportunity to find out
what their elected officials are doing for
them. This will givethe power back to the
students to determine whether or not their
elected representatives are living up to their
campaign promises and looking out for the
best interests of students. In addition to giv-
ing students the means to hold board mem-
bers Responsible, it is important that stu-
dents have the means to recognize their
own power by working on their own issues.
Both structural Modernization by S
Constitutional Revision, and physical
Modernization by changes toward a more
student friendly workspace setting on the
sixth ﬂoor are steps towards a more effective
Student Government. These changes will
create the kind of atmosphere that not only
allows, but encourages, students to utilize

the resources available to them so they can
realize their own power and effect change in
their own lives.

Reasons for Running: I have
been involved with Student Council and
Student Government ever since I have been
in seventh grade. When I toured the
University of Pittsburgh with the Honors
College, the first organization that I visited
was the SGB office. I learned. about all the
possibilities of becoming involved. When
ﬁnally came to Pitt I ran for the Freshmen
Affairs Committee Chair and received it.
Now that my term is over with that commit-
tee, I feel that it is time to move on to run-
ning for board. I enjoy working with peo-
ple, particularly my peers, and I believe that
a board position will give me the opportuni-
ty to work with other students and the
opportunity to make changes for those stu-
dents.

Goals if Elected: There are two
main concerns that I hope to resolve. The
first deals with landlord and property prob-
lems students have with off-campus hous-
ing. I believe in initiating a rating system
that would be created by students to evalu-
ate the different properties of areas near Pitt
campus, students would have information
about the properties at hand and would
know what they are getting into before sign-
ing a lease. The second problem deals with
our third stadium in three years. Students
must not lose our say in stadium concerns.
Last year was a step, but there needs to be
more student parking, at more frequent and
efficient shuttle system, an intact student
section for the student body, and activities at
the stadium each home game to attract stu-
dents downtown.

Like many freshman students, I
was completely disconnected from student
government. I did not know what was hap-
pening on campus, and I could care less.
This all changed last semester when I
attended the first Student Leader Forum.
Being around so many student leaders.
inspired me to engage the campus. I learned
that many students have the same concerns,
and that there are people on campus who
work for change. I left knowing that if we all
worked together our combined talents
would effect change on campus. I went to a
public board meeting and witnessed the
passion of active students.

There are many basic problems
students have with the university. Together
we will resolve these problems and cultivate
a campus of truth and virtue. My main prob-
lem is the lack of viable alternatives to the
mainstream campus culture. I want more
diversity! There are so many different ethnic
people and nationalities on this campus. I
will encourage the different cultural organi-
zations to give us a glimpse of their indige-
nous heritage, for us all to share each others
traditions. There are many social and politi-
cal perspectives, also. I would like these
opinions reflected in more public debates
and lectures. This will increase our under-
standing of a growing multi—ethnic society,
and give us enlightenment on becoming
socially responsible students. I want more
unity! Student organizations should be fami-
ly oriented, striving towards a campus com-
munity. To dothis we need:' more inter-
organizational communication and fellow-
ship; SGB actively involving themselves with
the decisions and policies determined by the
administration and faculty; SGB becoming a
visible influence on campus, and keeping
the students informed of the administration's
plans for the campus.

Politics, Philosphy
Knock Down the Walls

Communication, Information, and
Action. These are three things that our cam-
pus is currently lacking and need to have
instilled. Everyone always talks about the
apathy that persists on our campus, yet no
one has been able to find a successful solu-
tion to actually see a change; By' opening
up lines of communication, we will be able
to hold student government as well as
administration accountable to the students.
Knocking down the walls to communication
will open up new pathways for information
and resources, two things to which my slate
and I believe we all, as students, should
have easy access, and: for which student
government should be accountable. Only
then will apathy be overrun by action.

Working with the United States
Student Association, a national student orga-
nization whose primary function is ﬁghting
for access to education, has enabled me to
not only utilize the techniques of grassroots
organizing, but also see concrete results.
After working with a diverse group of stu-
dents from across the nation to lobby legisla-
tors on Capitol Hil in March, we have seen V
an increase in the federal Pell Grant, which
ultimately means more money for us! But
grassroots organizingis much closer to us
than that. We used grassroots organizing
successfully last semester to re-initiate the
Environmental Committee of Student
Government here on our own campus. In v
other words, grassroots organizing is not a
new concept, but it is something .that could,
and should be used by more students on our

campus. - We need to have a student govern-

ment that encourages students to take initia-
tive and create a culture on our campus that
is open to new ideas and new ways of
“doing business”.

The student forums that currently

take place are one great avenue to opening

up lines of communication, but what about
acting.on the issues we discuss? As a board
member, I would bring grassroots organizing
workshops to our campus that would teach
us how to effectively make the transition
from discussion to action. One of the best
lines I have ever heard was from a random
eighties song (whose name I cannot remem-
ber now), but the quote has always stuck
with me: “Don’t just stand there and shout
it, do something about it.” Rather than com-
plaining about student government, why
don’t we try a new approach? You can
make the difference, vote for action!!

Building the Bridges

The Student government board
should be accessible to us, accountable to
us, and reflect the diversity of our student
body. Currently this is not the case. I am
running to help create a new student gov-
ernment that will be accessible, accountable
and diverse.

ACCESSIBILITY: The student gov-
ernment board must listen to our voices.
They must be reaching out and making
themselves more accessible to the students.
I believe that to accomplish this SGB should
set up tables in the Towers, the Union, etc. '
where fellow students can come and ask
questions and express concerns. The walls
that separate us, the students, -from SGB
must be knocked down. SGB should also ,
have an online chat room‘ for those who
wish to talk to board members_but don’t feel
like having to come to a table.

ACCOUNTABILITY: Once SGB has
listened to what we have to say they must
be held accountable. Information on what
SGB is doing must be readily available.
Through a publication, like the one propose
by presidential candidate _Este Griffith, we
could provide the information of what SGB
is doing. I fully support this idea. I further
believe that SGB members, as our represen-
tatives, have an obligation to hold the
administration accountable to us. If I am
elected I promise to fight for you. Unlike
board members of years past, I will chal-
lenge the administration on issues and get
answers to our concerns.

_ DIVERSITY: The student govern-
ment can only truly represent us when it is
reﬂective of ALL of us. The current system
does not allow for this. If elected I will ,
assistin facilitating a truly representative sys-
tem. Greater diversity also needs to take
place in our faculty, administrators, staff and
programs. Our university should reflect the
multitude of people and ideas that we, the
student, bring to this atmpus.

The thing I hope to bring to SGB
more than anything else is a culture of
change. I believe that we have a window of
opportunity to change the way student gov-'
ernment works. My experience in the
Constitutional Review Committee, the United
States Students Association and the Black
Action Society can help us to create the
changes needed. We can build the bridges
between students,.faculty, administrators

. I have several reasons for running
for office. . Number one on my agenda is to
put the students first. Too often the student

. government board lets their own personal
feelings» get in the way of their business.
They make decisions that will help out only
their group or race, when in fact we should
make decisions that will help out all races,
religions, and genders.

Secondly, I Want to improve the
involvement of students on campus. I
believe that we should have more mass
mailings, not just via inter—school mail, but
also e-mail. Students communicate with
their professors via e-mail, sowhy not
inform students of upcoming events in this
way. »

Finally, I want to improve our cafe-
terias and food services, so they accommo-

date to our students. Several students I have I‘

talked to ‘stressed concerns to me about the
time of their meals. For example: One stu- _
dent told me he had classes during both
breakfastand lunch time at the Sutherland
cafeteria. Yes, he does have the option to
go to other places to eat, but this student
also has to balance his athletic practice
along with his schoolwork. If we just
changed the times or expanded upon them,

. it would help convenience the students.
Why if we spend 4.95 on a meal .10 is taken
off our dinning dollars, but if we spend 4.75,
:10 is not credited to our account.

Hopefully, once elected I can make

3 some changes take place. I will make deci-
sions to help all students, not just the rnajori-
ty, but all minorities included. I will also try
to increase student involvement in activities,
and finally increase the convenience of our
cafeterias. ‘

Top three concerns: Shuttle -
transportation. Divide between Greek and
non-Greek students. Smoother registration.

The shuttles should run more fre-
quent routes, and be more easily accessible.
There are students and especially student-
athletes who need to get up the hill very
early in the morning, but can’t access a shut-
tle because they are not yet running. Better
time-management may prove to help
tremendously. There seems to be a divide
between Greeks and non—Greeks, here at
Pitt. We propose that more activities (i.e.
mixers with athletic teams or different stu-
dent organizations, road trips, charity work,
etc.) should be planned in attempt to
decrease the distinction between the two
groups. Current registration is a mess. The
registration is done in a very archaic and
senseless way. No one wants to wait in line
forever to schedule their classes. We believe
that in an age of constant technological
advances, students should be able to sched-
ule in a more convenient fashion, such as
on-line registration.

My vision of what SGB is and what
it should be is very different. I believethat
SGB should represent the interests of the ‘
average student. SGB members should be
adept to whatis going on around them and
whatis happening outside the William Pitt
Union, as many do not. Student
Government should be more organized,
comprised of student politicians who want
to make the University of Pittsburgh a better
place for all students. My goal is to focus on
a few key concerns and create the best pos-
sible solutions. No more coming up with a
million different ideas that sound really
good but nothing ever gets done. I would
like to take on the tasks-that are the most
important to the average students, and work
with groups like the University Democrats,
College Republicans, BAS, and CWO to get
the job done! If I can help just one person,
than it will all be worth it and that is my rea-
son for running.

It is time the Student Government
Board put its focus back on the students.
My idea is to get the student body to exer-
cise its voice. I would like to get more stu-
dents involved in their government. Each
student should feel that his or her voice is
heard; -Every student has legitimate con-
cerns and the Student Government should
do its best to address them. The two main
problems on this campus are student apathy
and lack of representation that encompasses
all students in Student Government. SGB
has focused much effort on problems that
do not directly address the concerns of the.
student body. This defeats the purpose of
Student Government. I would like to bring
the students back into «the process by imple-
menting representative task forces to
address real student-life issues. By taking
the current student forum format and redi-
recting it to focus on more specific and stu-
dent oriented issues, we can tackle problems
like cafeteria efficiency, off-campus Internet
connections, and campus safety, which are
concerns of many students. These open
forums offer the student body a chance to
voice their concerns and be an active part of
discussing possible solutions to problems.
Then, the task forces can take the outcomes
of the forum and present them to the proper
administrators. The result of these forums
will be more meaningful changes and direct-
ed action by Student Government on issues
that matter to the entire student body, not
just a select few. By exercising our voices,
we can work together to make positive
changes at our University.

Many students on this campus do
not care about Student Government Board-
what it is, what it does, .and how it affects
them. I want this to change. Students need
to know that the Board delegates portions of
their tuition to any of the 200 plus student
organizations. Board members speak for the
students in working with the administration
and in making many decisionsaffecting this
campus. I decided to run for SGB last year
after I read an article in the Pitt News about
SGB’s spending $70,000 of student's money
on a statue of a Panther that I won’t even
see until after I graduate. What bothered me
is I was reading while waiting in line for 15
minutes in a computer lab. I kept wonder-
ing why SGB couldn't have purchased more
computers or something a little more benefi-
cial and practical. I found out that they
could have, but they didn’t.

If elected I will work with the
administration continuing SGB’s increasing
the number of Emergency Call Boxes.
However I want more security off-campus,
first by getting these emergency call boxes
in off-campus areas such as North and South
Oakland. Next, Van Call denies rriany stu-
dents service, saying that it’s too full, or that
a shuttle stop is close enough to walk to.
This “student-oriented" service needs to pay
a little more attention to students’ safety
needs. Another goal if elected is to hold bi-
monthly open discussion meetings through-
out campus, in Victoria, Benedum, Towers
lobby, and David Lawrence where all stu-
dents can come and speak to board mem-
bers. The Board member’s office hours up
in the Union are unapproachable and there-
fore ineffective, and the weekly meetings
are too intimidating for some students. I
want to improve communication between
SGB andstudents, and I want my goals to
reflect of students’ ideas and interests, by
hearing what each student has
to say.

Reason for Running: My reasons
for running and my goalsif elected are so
closely related as to be considered the same
thing. In it's current state; I feel the
University’s Student Government Board is
not a truly representative organization. The
idea that eight board members and a 9
President can adequately addresslthe con-
cerns of approximately 15,000 undergradu-
ate students, no matter how dedicated the
board members and President may be, is
unrealistic. Therefore, my goal, if elected, is
to pursue the reengineering of student gov-
ernment to make it more representative of

_the student body at large and make it more

accessible to students of all interests and
organizations.

9 Pursuant to this agenda, I wish to
amend, although a more appropriate term
would be to replace, the current Student
Government Board constitution, with one
that allows for a Student Senate comprised
of approximately 40 representatives. In all
likelihood, the senate will have several posi-
tions reserved for representatives from par-
ticular colleges and schools within the
University as well as representatives from
the residence halls and any governance ‘
groups not affiliated with a particular col-
lege. This new system is comparable to the
way other student governments are orga-
nized. With even preliminary research, it is
clear that Pittsburghis eight-member board is
something of an anomaly among student
governments. I make this statement after
comparing our system against other under-
graduate programs ranging from the

. University of Michigan to Princeton

University to the University of Notre Dame.
By adopting these changes, I feel
the new student government will be better
able to address such issues as improving the
quality of life for residence hall students,
streamlining the allocations process, and
better addressing the needs of the various
governance groups across campus.

My involvement with the
Constitutional Review Committee is what
originally inspired me to run for Student
Government Board. During my time here at
Pitt, I have felt the.students could be better
represented by the Student Government
Board. After getting involved with the com-
mittee, I began to see some of the short,
comings of the current system, and I saw my
opportunity to make it better. I am running
to make sure that process is completed and
that all students are represented in student
government. I also feel that programming
by the Pitt Program Council is not reflective
of What students want to see. I want to
make sure students are gettingto see what "
they want to see, and that their opinions on
programs are represented.

If Elected, I plan to do three main
things. The first of these will utilize my
experience on the Constitutional Review
Committee. I hope to act as a liaison
between the committee and the board, the
process goes smoothly, and the committee
can be allowed to finish what it started, and
create a constitution that is equitable and
represents all students. Secondly, I would
like to build a partnership with the Pitt
Program Council to make sure all student
opinions are represented in its program-
ming. Concerts are a good example of this
representation issue. We have 14,000 stu-
dents on this campus, but we can’t get a
decent concert. There are also many other
universities in the area that we can work
with to get programming that students Want
to see. Finally, I would like to have voting
students on the board of Trustees. The
Board of Trustees controls all the money that
comes in to this university, tuition money,
yet students have no right in determining
how it is spent. Students deserve the right to
have a vote on this board, because they
make decisions every day that affect our
lives here at Pitt. We have to find an equi-
table solution to this problem that has per-
sisted for such a long time, and make the
trustees see that giving students a vote is just
the right thing to do.

Qualiﬁcations: My qualifications
for SGB can be better understood by what I
have done, rather than what specifically I
was involved in. Last year, as vice president
of ASA I worked heavily with other organi-
zations on coalition building. A past partici-

“ pant of GROW (Grass Roots Organizing

Weekend), I became dedicated to seeing
change happen via the unification of diverse
students who stand for what they believe.
Last February, I worked with several organi-
zations and talked with many students about
the application process for becoming the
eighth student government board member.
With the combined effort, a powerful coali-
tion Was formed. Despite the failure of its
specific goal, strong relationships were
formed amongst diverse groups and individ-
uals. This drove me to become involved in
the Constitutional Review Committee which
is reviewing the constitution and by-laws to
be more applicable to the students here
today. T wo things remain true at Pitt: 1)
Diversity on this campus runs deep. A fact
which is overshadowed by words like
majority and minority, but diversity is not a
racial issue. It is an issue of multiple interest
groups and cultures. The real minority of
this campus consists of those who vote, the
real minority of this campus consists of
those who feel ownership to- this school, the
real minority consists-of those who hold
information about the dynamic of this insti-
tution. 2) Despite this diversity, we all have
-common concerns, but a majority of us has

' yet. to mobilize on any of them in a unified

manner. This is due to lack of communica-
tion, information and awareness.

My general goal for Student
Govermnentl Board is a redefinition of
responsibility. It is important to vote for a
board who can facilitate SGB as a more
applicable and receptive resource for stu-
dents, and who understand the value of rep-
resentation and accessibility. SGB should be
the unifying force behind our diverse stu-
dent population that empowers students,
giving them ownership to this institution.
This will be accomplished through reception
to concerns and distribution of knowledge.
My specific goal is_ to organize a task force
that will research where our tuition is going
and produce a balance sheet with the ulti-
mate goal of being published. I want to see,
and be apart of, a student government that
desires to decrease apathy, and increase
leadership accountability. "

Pitt’s volleyball team ended its reg-
ular season on an up note this year. The

.22-9 season ended in West Virginia

where the Panthers won‘ 3-1 over the
Mountaineers.

The first game went to Pitt by the
score of 15-13. Pitt dropped game two
7-15 before taking games three and four
by the scores of 15-11 and 15-7.

Marcia Thiesen led the «team with
20 kills on 44 attempts for a .318 per-
centage and also a team—high 15 digs.
Jen Nickels had 10 kills, four aces, 11

Renick also had a double-double with
_l1 kills and 13 digs.

April Puzauskas chipped in defen-

sively with nine digs and Lisa Riggle

and Alexandra Lacenere added eight
and six digs, respectively. Heather Haff
had a few kills and digs and also lead
the team with five block assists.

The team combined for 14 blocks
and 81 digs as compared to West
Virginia’s two blocks and 49 digs. West
Virginia, 8-17 on the season, had three
players with double-doubles.

Erica Montana, Adriana Hardy and
Jamie Boardman all posted big numbers
as the Mountaineers fell to 2-9 in the
Big East.

The game was played in front of
250 people at the WVU Coliseum. The
game lasted almost two hours, but in the
end the Panthers earned themselves an
8-3 record in the Big East ﬁnishing
among the top four teams in the confer-
ence and getting themselves into the
tournament, which starts Thursday.

Pitt, ranked third in the conference,
will play No. 2 Rutgers, who, only two
weeks ago, beat Pitt at home. The Big
East Tournament will be hosted by No.
1 Notre Dame. The Pitt-Rutgers match

will takeplace Friday at 4 p.m.

. After Saturday’s 35-7 loss to Miami, Pitt head
coach Walt Harris and the rest of the Pitt team had
no one to blame but themselves. ’

. The Panthers are still looking for its sixth win,
which will make them bowl eligible. At his week-
ly press conference yesterday, Harris reﬂected on
the loss to Miami.

“Last weekend was a good ballgame for a
while,” Harris said. “We made it hard on ourselves
by throwing an interception that was ran back for
a touchdown. I thought our defense played
tremendously, Offensively, we had some good
things, but we continued with the mood of not
being consistent.” I

The loss on Saturday to Miami marked the

A third straight loss for the Panthers and their second

loss in three weeks to a No.-2 school. After three
consecutive losses, questions arise about the

. team’s frame of mind and their confidence level.

Harris was certain that everything is ﬁne.
“I’m sure it’s a little frustrating for everybody,
that we haven’t gotten that [sixth win] out there

Temple after loss to Miami

yet,” Harris said. “I think our players are in a
sound frame of mind. ,We have good leadership in
our seniors.”

Saturday’s game was marked by crucial mis-
takes made by the Panthers. There were seven
dropped passes, an interception returned for a
touchdown and a key fumble to start the second
half. According to Harris, that isn’t Pitt football.

“When they caused the fumble, it changed the
momentum of the game,” Harris said. “Our chance
was early. We had one [pass] to Latef [Grim] that
was open, one to Antonio [Bryant]. I think we fig-
ure we had seven drops. That’s not us, that’s not
the way we play.” P ,

Harris was furious when he talked about the
drops, fumbles and interceptions. He said he does-
n’t tolerate them and never will.

“I think those are hard to overcome no matter
how many years I’m coaching here,” Harris said
about mistakes on the field. “I don’t think our guys
should drop any balls.  Fumbles are in the same
mood.  Drops, fumbles and interceptions are not
part of where we live, what we are all about, what
we preach, what we believe.”

Stee|ersaren’t

For most of the season, the
Steelers have been focused on tak-
ing it one game at a time. After
opening with three straight losses,
it was hoped that maybe the team
could at least pull off a winning
season. But then the team won five
straight, and then, after the
Steelers’ 9-7 loss to Tennessee,
there came talk of the unmention-
able — the playoffs.

As Ixread an article on this topic
in Thursday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, I couldn’t help but laugh.
Steelers coach Bill Cowher actually
told his team that it would win its
next seven games and talked about
making the playoffs,

Now I root for the Steelers just.

as much as the next Pittsburgher,
but seriously, did anyone really
think it was possible?

Of course we now know the
answer is no after the Steelers’ 26-
23 overtime loss to the Eagles. And
after watching that game, I really
don’t believe the Steelers are a team
that should be in the playoffs.

It seemed probable that
Pittsburgh would claim a victory as
it led Philly 23-13 with less than
three minutes left in the game. But
somehow the Steelers let it slip
away. Instead of being a mediocre

5-5, the Steelers should be at least
6-4. They had to win and should
have.

Neither offense was effective
early on, and penalties were abun-
dant, some of which were certainly
questionable.

, Overall the Steelers 
took 13 penalties for 141 7" F
Yards while the Eagles 
took nine for 61. You just
can’t give away those yards,
and the Steelers are lucky.
that it didn’t hurt them as
badly as it could have.

With the score tied at
13, Joey Porter gave the
Steelers the lead with a ‘
32-yard return of a fum- 
ble by. Philly’s Stanley
Pritchett. A field goal by
Kris Brown then extended the
Steeler lead and they appeared to be
in complete command.

With 9:04 remaining in the
game, Eagles kicker David Akers
missed a 38-yard field goal attempt
when the ball bounced off the
upright, a miss that seemed
insignificant at the time. But as the
Steelers’ lead deteriorated, those
missed three points played a key
role. ’ A

With less than three minutes

left, Eagles quarterback Donovan
McNabb found Brian Mitchell in
the end zone to give Philly hope and
fuel the .unlikely comeback The
Eagles recovered the onside kick
and as time expired, Akers drilled a
42-yard field goal to send the game
into overtime.
As I slumped back
into my seat at_ Three
Rivers Stadium, all I was
experiencing was complete
disbelief. I had sincerely
thought that the Steelers
would top the Eagles, the
fittings end to the
Pittsburgh-Philadelphia
rivalry that saw
‘Penguins beat the Flyers
just days‘ before. I had
thought that maybe, just
maybe, the Steelers were a better
team that their 5-4 record had indi-
cated.
But those thoughts. quickly left
my mind. '
’ Any team that is going to have a
successful season and make the

 

playoffs cannot lose games in that"

situation, and the debacle that

unfolded with just minutes left
proves that the Steelers’ arenot
quite playoff material.

They never even had a chance in

the

close to the playoffs

overtime, as Philly won the toss and

McNabb drove 39 yards before

Akers kicked the winning 42-yard
field goal.
Despite the fact that McNabb

finished with just 213 yards on 552

attempted passes, despite the fact
that Jerome Bettis had 134 yards
and a touchdown, the Steelers man-
aged to lose the game.

“You have it right there, you go
to grab it and it just falls through
your fingers,” Cowher told
reporters after the game.

In words that could have come
straight out of Antonio Bryant’s
mouth, the Steelers’ coach summed
up not only the loss but the team’s
short—lived playoff hopes.

Now that winning seven in a
row is no longer a possibility, will
Cowher claim that the team can win
its next six? Will he still talk of the

. playoffs like it is a reachable goal

for the team?

Maybe it’s time the Steelers A

went back to taking it one game at a
time. -

Karen Bielak is a columnistfor The
Pitt’News, and feels that before the
Steelers can think about making ‘the
playoffs, they should think about
getting a decent quarterback. V

The turning point in the game was
the fumble by Kevan Barlow on the
