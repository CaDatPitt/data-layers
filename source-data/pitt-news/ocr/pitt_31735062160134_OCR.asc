Congress Campaigning Starts Again

, Battles Looms Between Frat Men
1 And Independents in Elections

THOMAS

It looks like the independents and the fraternity men

will be at each other’s throats again in this year’s -student

elections on Apr. 23.
Probably, fraternity men who

bolt from the idea of an Interfra-

ternity Slate will help out the in-

dependents once ‘the different sides
martial their forces. ‘

Ross Reese, president of the Pitt
I n d e p e n dents Association,‘ is
guiding the formation of one slate
to battle IF Council's domination
of Student Congress. He told the
News, “This year's Congress didn't
do; much and our group hopes to
improve the quality; of student
government next year.”

Fraternity men Dan Purdy and
Larry Adler are working with
Reese on the new party. Com-

mented Purdy, “There is deﬁnite

fraternity men who are opposed
to an IF Slate.”

Reese hopes to draw other cam-
pus groups into his party. _

At the same time Lud Lippert,
new president of the IF Council,
declined to say whether or not the
frat men would even form a‘ party

ably not materialize before Apr.
20, the Sunday before elections.

while building shore installations
for the U.S. Fleet. «

Fear of Appropriation Cut

Page 2—THE PITT NEWS——-Friday, April 4, 1952'

Professional Politicians Endorse Political Clubs

 

  

Groundless, Politicos Say ‘A

By JACK MARKOWITZ
Pitt can be assured that its yearly appropriation won’t

be!“ slashed if and when the

University approves political

groups.
’1‘hat’s the opinion of three Al-
legheny County political ﬁgures,
two Republicans and a Demo-
crat, who said today that Pitt
administration should allow stu-
dents to work presidential can-
didates on campus.
State Senator Joseph M. Barr,
"county Democratic secretary, said,
“No one in Harrisburg is narrow
enough to try to cut Pitt’s appro-
priation, just because the" school
‘okays political clubs.” Sen. Barr
said that Pitt would be on the safe
side if University approval is giv-
en only to both major political
parties.
Stassen Under Fire
The Senator, a -1928 Pitt ‘grad-
uate,,'said that “there might be
criticism in the legislature_ if it
looked like University officials
were trying to steer one or more
of the clubs.” He added that in
that connection University of
Pennsylvania President Harold
Stassen was temporarily under
ﬁre in Harrisburg for not taking
leave of Penn while campaigning
for President. But Sen. Barr said
that the possibility of a cut in
Penn’s appropriation did not even
enter legislators’ discussions.

Establishment of poltical clubs’

at Pitt would be “good American-
ism,” according to Laurence Gibbs,
county headquarters. manager for
Sen. Robert A. Taft.
Taft Group Supported
The county Taft organization,

dents for Taft Group at Pitt,
thinks that “campus clubs will
produce better citizens,” Mr. Gibbs
said. He added that the students
which the headquarters is nowad-
vising “seem to be thinking for
themselves.” I . .
The Pitt Taft group, with a
membership of 100, goes before
the University recognition com-
mittee at its ﬁrst meeting after
the Easter recess.

. Mr. Gibbs said that in the past
the average student was not as in-
terested in politics as he should be._
He explained that educators were
partially to blame for making the
students feel that they were not
experienced enough to participate
iu political affairs. “But when you
are 21, you have just as much of
a vested interest in politics as old-
er people,” the Taft manager
pointed out. ' '

Sizeable Enrollment Drop

Pitt is not expectingian appreci-

Although the draft scare, uni-
versal military training, and the
low birth rate of the 1930’s has
cut college registration the past
year, Pitt, being in an urban area,
is (not expected to suffer, Batch-
elder said. .

Enrollment in colleges through-

out the country is expected to
drop steadily for the next few
years but should increase early in
1960 when the war babies reach
college age, according to Federal
education experts.

Lloyd Fuge last week became

Phenomenally, Fuge has no

He has memorized stairs, room
locations, and hallways so that
he can get around as well as his
fellow students in their treks
through the halls. -

V ‘Every morning he walks from
his room on N. Dithridge Street to

Fuge, says, “I listen to the cars

Fuge, a 22-year-old philosophy
major, has surmounted his handi-
‘cap; Hired readers aid him in his
studies. He takes all his tests
orally. As a freshman he was

_ tapped to Phi Eta Sigma, for main-

taining a straight “A” average.
This year he was elected to Druids,
sophomore activity honorary. At
present he is petitioning for Stu-

~ dent Congress and is a member of

the Executive Committee of the

Lloyd had always been inter-
ested in chemistry and so" he de-
cided to attempt an experiment‘ of
his own. He brought the chem
supplies home and laid them on the

Fuge Elected ‘Y’ Head

bed in his room.

He had decided that he would
conduct the experiment later as
he had a meeting scheduled for
that evening. Later, having ﬁn-
ished dressing, Lloyd forgot about
the chemicals and threw himself
on the bed.

Terriﬁc Explosion

The impact of his body crashed
the supplies together. The con-
cussion resulted in a terriﬁc ex-
plosion and Lloyd Fuge awoke
seconds later, a blind man.

Fuge hopes to enter law school
after graduation. Someday he in-
tends to go to Alaska which he
feels is a country of opportunity.

But most of all Lloyd Fuge is
looking forward to seeing again.
And there-is a possibility that an
operation next summer will help
him realize this hope.

Greek Week

, The highlight of the current Greek Week-
comes off this afternoon when Admiral Ben
Moreell serves up a tasty offeringof inspira-
tion for the frat, men and sorority girls. They
should in turn reward him by showing up
forehis talk in suﬁiciently inspiring numbers.

It is rather difficult at this time to decide
just what Greek Week is doing for the Greeks
or the University. In fact, it is equally diffi-
cult to decide just what the whole thing is
about anyway. ' . ' S

If you judge by the program, a lot of peo-

Y ple were on a lot of committees and were mo-
tivated by a certain amount of sincerity.
._They have a good idea. I

But, the only way such a week can justi-
fy itself is by concentrating more on those
students who know nothing about the
Greeks. There is no real reason for a group of

‘frat men getting together and discussing

themselves. They are, after all, largely agreed

that they are okay. '

The ladies are no doubt gird-
ing their loins for the yearly tus- "H
sle in the dog-eat—dog world of
high fashion come Easter Sun-
day. ‘ '

Though, that particular Sab-
some nine days

bath is still
away, the fol-
lowing advice
will be eager-
ly appreciated
by the dis- _
cerning, com- '
ing as it does
from one who
e a r n s h i s
lunch money 4_
selling wom- 1
en’s footwear.
This writer  _ _ A
makes no pre- . _
tense of knowing what is what In
ladies’ undies, dresses or cha-
peaux. Here is shoe advice only:

a classy wardrobe is built ‘from
the ground up. How many babes
have carefully built an expensive
effect by draping their upper
parts in well—tailored dry goods,
only to have that effect rudely
shattered south of the ankles?

The ﬁrst thing to know is that

 

this year’s leading fashion is the .

“naked look,” a deceptive term,
since it suggests that there is
something stimulating. about the
exposed foot, and this is not so.
Of course a shoe salesman who
has viewed intimately so many
denuded feet is’ actually a poor
judge of this, since his sensibili-
ties may be somewhat jaded.

The “naked look” refers only
to the fact that shoes of that or-
der consist of a heel, a sole, and
a few scraps of kite string. A
transient fashion, it reflects the
insecurity of our time.

Fashion Hit _ -

Changing of fashions is a
strange phenomenon—-it’s some-
thing‘like changing the Party
Line: what looked good yester-
day looks repulsive today.

But the changes never come

from the common folk, only from _

the big boys. Biggest news in
men’s clothing last year was that
“Harvard Men Lead the Way
With Shoestring Bow Ties.” It
was‘ good to see Harvard reas-
serting its rightful position of
leadership in the things of the
intellect.

But to get back to the girls,
New York says that the color and
material of the footgear is of
prime importance this spring,
rather than style.

A while back a gal came into
the store and asked a salesman
for a black suede pump (way out
of line at this time__ of year). The
salesman looked at her for a long
moment, and then whispered
with visible effort, “Excuse me,
what did you say?” She repeated,
“Something in black, please.” He
reached, the color left his cheeks,
and they retired him, with full
pay, a raving maniac.

Altitude Important
, Naturally, high heels are
always in top style. That they
add stature to a gal is admitted
by all, but they make it tohgh
on femmes of elongated frame.

Shoe hucksters have tried in
vain to satisfy tall girls in this
respect. But nature is a tough
adversary.

After this dissertation, pre-
sumably, no Pitt coed will appear
injthe Easter parade with any-
thing but the right shoe on. And
it is to be hoped that they will
apply the same idealism to other
items of the wardrobe.

There is nothing quite so sat-
isfying ‘as the sight of a cute
chick enclosed in tasteful mer-
chandise. But it is as impossi-
ble to appreciate a. "beautiful

babeill-dressed as it would be —.

to enjoy Grand Canyon
through a soiled car window.
Yet let the ladies realize that
they enter the Easter parade not‘
for themselves alone, but for
Pitt. A good impression on the
oglers is effective public rela-
tions.

Set To Enter
District Trials

By DON SCHURMAN

Grand slams are ‘rarity in
any sport, But there’s a
father-son combination ~ at
Pitt that will be attempting such a
sweep in the Tri-State Olympic
Wrestling Tryouts at the Field
House on Wednesday and Thurs-
day.

iFor among Coach Rex Peery’s
entries in the tourney is his scrap-
ping son, Hugh, who will be after
his third big championship of the
year. ‘

Hugh’s big-time conquests al-
ready this year include the 117-
pound championship of_ the Four-
I’s and the national ~1l5—pound title
in the recent NCAA tournament.

Finals at Iowa

Competing in the 114.5-pound
division next week, he will be on
the first leg of a tournament series
that will eventually determine the
U.S. Olympic team.

If successful in the Tri-State

tourney, as seems probable, the,

young Peery, along with all the
other ﬁnalists of the district elim-
inations, will be eligible. for the
ﬁnal trials at Ames, Iowa, late this
spring.

A win at the Iowa ﬁnals would
complete High’s grand slam of ma-
jor tournaments, a remarkable
feat for a sophomore wrestler.

Rookies Gain
Starting Slots

By RUSS FRANKE

Five rookies had hustled
their way into the ‘starting
lineup which was announced
byCoach Ralph Mitterling prior to
leaving for Ohio yesterday.

The team scheduled to take the
ﬁeld against Ohio State showed
sophomores Pat Bieno at second
base, Charley Reese at shortstop,
and Rudy Filek at third, with
freshmen Bob Kyle in left ﬁeld
and Sam Little in center.‘

“These are the boys who have

shown the stuff,” says Mitterling,

“and seem to work well together.”
Lomond Ace Twirler

Paul Lomond, star righthander

from Clairton, was named to take
the mound in the opener with the
Buckeyes Thursday at Columbus.

(Editor’s Note—-The Pitt news’

went to press before the Pitt-Ohio
State game yesterday).

The 20-man squad, including six’
other pitchers, will move over to
Athens to take on Ohio University
today and tomorrow. 4

Veteran Ollie Niemela and fresh-
man Milt Emery, a converted sec-
ond—baseman from Peabody, are
expected to share the catching
chores.

Scalzo Shifted

Joe Scalzo, a regular at second
last year, has been shifted to ﬁrst
base with utility man Sam Rago
taking over right ﬁeld, both moves
designed to add batting power.

By the time the Panthers come
home to prepare for the inaugural
at Mellon Field Apr. 12 with Kent
State, Mitterling expects to know
whether or not he can keep the
newcomers in the lineup.

linemen for three years, complet-
ed their eligibility last fall.

Now, the job of rebuilding an
aggressive line (maybe of the
Michigan State variety) falls upon
the shoulders of Dawson, an ex-
Michigan State coach, who admits
that his present forward wall
‘lacks experience.

be until after spring training. “I

mats is, however, attributable to
the meticulous coaching of father
Rex, who himself was an outstand-

“I grew up around wrestling,”
Hugh reflects. “But I really started
wrestling at Tulsa Central High

Two more squads swing into ac-

on one of Pitt’s three defeats last

very same feat his father accom-
plished 21 years before.

By winning the National Col-
legiates last week, he again dupli-
cated an oldtime Peery feat. Coach
Peery won the NCAA in 1933-35.

The Pan-American Olympic
championship which Hugh won
last year is, at present, his most
impressive title, however. Even
so, it is only one of eleven titles
he has to his record. r

In bidding for No. 12, the pre-
dent will make his last home ap-
pearance of the season.

70 Entrants Due

It will also be the ﬁnal showing
for the rest of the team, all of
whom Coach Peery is entering in
the tourney.

They will compete in a ﬁeld of
an estimated 70 entrants, so far
representing six states——Pennsyl-.
Vania, Illinois. Ohio, New Jersey,
Maryland, and Michigan. W

Among Pitt’s representatives,
Charley Uram, Joe, Solomon, and
George Matthews are the bright-
est hopes. _

Heavyweight Eldred Kraemer,
who is ineliliglé to represent the
Panthers due to scholastic proba-
tion, will compete unattached. Be-
gause of his great strength, which
IS a majorfactor under the Oym-

food was just too tasty. for

on . the second point, Carlson¢
says, “Every time I go to a meet-
E ing, my ego rises. Why the Notre
Dame coach (Johnny Jordan) told
 .me what a great guy I am. Every
time I bring up something at a
meeting they vote it down, and
pass it the following year.”_

Is Zone On Way Out?
Carlson predicts that next year’s
ENCAA/‘meeting will approve the
‘twelve foot‘ free throw lane the
same as used in the professional

leagues this year.

= I The present free throw lane
is six feet. Were the twelve foot

, lane used, it "would stop such big
boys as Mark Workman from
scoring so often on tap-ins, be-
cause they would be three feet
from the hoop.

The newpsetup would also mod-

ify the zone defense as it would
bring the zone out to guard ‘more
‘outside shooting. The offense
I would have even less room_ t_o
work in, or better yet the offense
won’t hang around the basket as
much as this year.
With the twelve foot foul lane in
A the pro leagues the zone defense is
"disallowed. Anyteam in the Na-
tional Professional League«-using
the zone is ﬁned $500.

Not in Bag Anymore
But more important is what the
INCAA meeting, attended by 150
coaches, proposed this year. It
ruled that there will be no waiv-
' ing of a foul shot in the last three
minutes of play and that every foul

would beworth two foul shots.
This would give the losing
team a chance to get the ball in
the waning minutes, rather than
the winning squad _ continually
taking the bailout of bounds.
The committee attempted to
ease the ofﬁcial’s position I by
ruling that no foul. should be
called until a. man has lost some
sort .of advantage illegally.
Carlson quipped, “The Rules
Committee increased the penalty
both oﬁensively and defensively,
but when I asked to make the pen-
alty of thegoifensive foul less, they
voted me down, 49-2.”

High Altitude Window Washing

Just a Breeze for Jack Adams

 

By CLARK SUTTON
High atop the Cathedral,

Jack Adams ﬁrmly plants his

size eight shoes on a three

inch ledge and swings his wet
cloth over dirty windows in

such a carefree manner that
ofﬁce iworkers hastily leave
the room, afraid that they’ll
 him, fall’ 36 stories to the
ground. ‘

f Adams, who says he has been in

the business longer than he cares

to remember, can’t understand
why people ‘safe on the inside’ al-
most faint from fear when he
crawls out into space to do his
work. “It doesn’t bother me at

all,” he says. ,

I Eight hours a day, ﬁve days a.

Adams has gone about his task
as if he were safely in bed with
only a foot or two between him
and the ﬂoor.

In all his experience, he has not

an over-eager, half-frightened Pitt

headed for the bottom.

“It'was a windy day and'I was

Well, there I was, just hanging
there with nothin’ below me but
space. _I called this professor to
open the window, and he nearly
passed out when he saw me stand-

“But he opened“ the window,”
Adams continued, “and grabbed
