The ‘Golden Key National Honor
_Society welcomed 670 new members

at its annual induction ceremony on
Saturday night. ' .
Golden Key is an international
honor society ‘that was founded in
1977 at Georgia State University.

‘Today, the organization has expanded

to include chapters from 260 universi-

ties from the. United States and’

around the world, including schools
in.Australia, Canada, Malaysia, New
Zealand and South Africa. .
Membership is offered to juniors
and seniors who earn academic dis-
tinction by maintaining a grade point
average of 3.3 or better and who are
in the top 15 percent of their class; _
Eligible students receive a letter
in the mail inviting them to fill out a

membership application. The juniors

' ' and seniors who acceptjthe offer pay a

one—time membership fee of $60 and
become lifetime members. p

_ Golden Key President Melissa
Barnell began Saturday night’s cere-
mony__ by welcoming’ the new

.inductees with a speech discussing
the society and its activities.

Bruce- Webb, the §
Key International Headquarters in
Atlanta, Ga., next congratulated the

new members, gave a brief history of

the society and highlighted its bene-

ﬁts. In closing, Webb inspired the

inductees by giving them-Asomething .
' to think about. .

“We do not imitate, for we are a
model of others,” Webb said. “We are
the model ‘of student leadership, we
are the model for community ‘service,

and we are the model for academic ;

excellence.”

Student strips to pay for education

REBECCA HUDOCK

The Pitt News

With eyes wide open, Amy
stared at the beautiful blond danc-
ing across the dimly lit stage and
had a revelation. Within minutes,
shespoke to the burly manager and
secured herself an audition.

An hour later, she was the
newest employee Bare Elegance, a
higher“-scale strip club in the Strip
District. But Amy (her name has
been changed in this story) isn’t
just a stripper, she is also a full-
time student at Pitt.

Three" times a week, Amy wakes
up at 7 a.m., bleary—eyed from the
smoke—filled night before.

' Her days are spent rushing from
class to class, cramming for_ exams,
and catching up on sleep; During
herwaking hours, she has the same
worries as other students: passing
her" classes,“ remaining. attentive

1during-,t,he lectures softboring pro-_

fessors, allocating time to shop for

’ groceries and wondering where ‘the
money for next‘ month’s rent is‘ -

coming from. v , .

It was ‘the latter worry that in
early August made heristarti ques-
tioning where she was going to find
work for the school year.

Like other students, her initial
goal was to find a job that creates
the most revenue for the least
amount of hours. Amy knew from a
previous secretarial job that a work-

study assignment was out of the

question. .

“Every "day when I went to work
I would put my head down on my
arms and fall asleep. I honestly

don’t know how I ever did work.

likethat,” said Amy, shaking her
head in yperplexity. 6

With some prompting from a
few male‘ friends, the dark-haired
Amy began to consider becoming a
stripper. p ' 7 6

Shepseemed to. have the righ
attitudeifor the business: She. is
quick to toss her long thick hair
over her-shoulder and start a flirta-
tious conversation witha stranger.
Her laugh is gusty, and‘ she is a
firm believer in “if you have it,
flaunt it”. .

At just over 5 feet 8 inches tall,

, or 5 feet 10 inches in stilettos, the

slim Amy exemplifies just what
many men vie for.

When she first starteddancing
she was nervous and hesitant about
the reaction that she might receive.
She was also turned off by the fact
that she was stripping for people

6. upon them. . -

that were generally the age of her
father. _ .
But despite her initial fears,

three times a week she takes a‘

seven-minute taxi ride from her
apartment in North Oakland to the

club.

From the outside, Bare
Elegance resembles the ' average
windowless aluminum warehouse.
The only thing that distinguishes
the building as a club is the classic
black awning covering the entrance.

6 Inside the heavy mahogany
doors, a young woman who appears
to be in her 20s’ sells anything from

’.T—shirts to coffee mugs with the

Bare Elegance logo emblazoned

The floor - area is dimly lit
except for candles that ﬂicker in the
center of every table. Women rang-
ing from ‘.18 to 35 navigate around
the small tables striking up conver-
sations with men. Most of the
women are in various stages of

A, undress asthey, cunningly entice

menjinto buying drinks .or- lap
dances. . A’ - A
Some lmiddle-aged men sit in
cushioned chairs, their suits rum-
pled andtheir ties loosened. They
usually are alone, except for the
attention of a young stripper. _

Some younger men, dressed in

. thelatest trends in men’s business

and casual wear,_ cheer rambunc—
tiouslytfor their favorite girl as she
takes a swing around the brass pole.

Sunken in the middle of the club
floor is the gleaming black stage

A and two brass po1es.'Once or twice

a night each stripper will dance to

two or three songs. But the real’

money to be made is mingling on
the floor or back in one of the.pri-
vate champagne rooms.

And it’s the money that makes
Amy and her fellow dancers return
night after night. On most weekend
nights, -a dancer can make as much
as $700 after tipping the bouncers,

' bartenders and the DJ.

‘ And when it comes time to pay-

ing the -tuition bill, the extra money

isgreatly appreciated. I

“The"biggest thing for me about
my job is being able to help my par-
ents out with all the bills; they still
have my brother to put through col-
lege,” explained Amy.-

But Amy hasn’t told her parents
what she" does. She explains her
recent inﬂux in cash as a result of a

‘lucrative cocktail serving job ata

local club.

Friends’ reactions to Amy’s job
are favorable, especially among the
guys hoping to receive VIP passes.

Retaking the road test will   I
keep senior drivers up to. ‘speed

Climbing stairs, touching your
toes, remembering your early’ child-
hood, driving a car —— a lot of things ‘
get harder to do as one grows older.
Driving can be particularly daunting

. for many senior citizens. According

to a recent study‘ by The Road
Information Program, over the past
10 years Pennsylvania has experi-
enced a 43 percent increase in the

I number of driversiaged 70 and older

who are, killed in trafﬁc accidents,

‘ and our state now ranks fourth in

terms of number of ‘ elderly auto
accident victims killed in the past
year. i
According to TRIP Executive

- Director \VIlliarn Wilkins, the solu-

tion to this problem may lie in mak-
ing road improvements to render our
highways and byways more senior-
citizen friendly. Vlfilkins’ sugges-
tions include improving lighting,
making signs more visible and
adding more separate left-tum lanes.

‘ These ideas aren’t bad in and of
themselves; everyone knows that
Pennsylvania’s roadways could
stand some improving. But will bet-
ter ﬁghting really solve all of our

_state’s_ senior driving woes? It seems
that more drastic measures will be
requisite.

All Pennsylvania drivers — not

justthe elderly —_-— should have to

take the road testmore often to get
their " licenses renewed. The test
doesn’t take very long and qualiﬁed
drivers should have no problem.
Those‘ who ﬁnd their skills lacking
would then know speciﬁcally what
to practice and could work on

improving these areas of their dri-

ving ﬁnesse before retaking the test.
Adults should retake the test every
10 years; senior citizens aged 65 and

8 older, every ﬁve years.

If TRIP’s suggestions don’t
work, it may be time to take more
drastic measures. The creation of a
geriatric speedway comes to mind.
Only Cadillacs, Buicks, Lincolns
and recreational vehicles in excess
of eight. feet in length would be
allowed. Extra-wide lanes would be
an essential feature, along with rum-
ble strips. For the utmost conve-
nience, tollsl could be paid with’
AARP cards. The speed limit, natu-
rally, would be 20 mph, though the‘
entire road would be downhill, to
give the seniors a little boost. V

The notion of such a speedway
is indeed a silly solution to a serious
problem. However, the proposal that
more visible signs, better lighting
and left-tum lanes could prevent the
deaths of hundreds of elderly people

' in fatal crashes is equally if not more

preposterous.

The old man and the coconut

When you ride public transportation
everyday, as I do, you become accus-
tomed to seeing some strange people.
But I thought I saw one to top them all
some time ago while riding a bus from

I Oaklandto Wilkinsburg.

Sitting at the back of the
bus, I peered through the
tangle of standers to see an
elderly man sitting at the
frontof the bus. He was a
distinguished-looking fellow

’— neatly dressed, with a stylishly
trimmed white beard. In his lap lay a .

coconut, which-. he 6' was stroking with

V‘ apparent affection. From time to. time he

cast down loving glances at the tropical
fruit. _

Now, I’ve known people who treat
pets with the same affection that they
lavish on humans. Actually I’m one of

- those folks. I also count myself among

those bibliophiles. whose handling of rare
or valued books constitutes a’ form of
lovemaking. But'to give this type of
enraptured devotion, to a coconut? Surely

, this was the most deviant behavior I had

ever seen. .
But perhaps this old man was not
alone in his affectional orientation.

Might there, in fact, be a whole subcul-.

ture of coconut fondlers out there, invis-
ibly intermingled with “normal” society?
Perhaps they congregate in local meeting
houses. Might there even be underground
magazines devoted to the coconut—loving
lifestyle? Perhaps somewhere some grad-
uate student like myself is even writing a
dissertation oncoconut lovers’ literature!

As the crowded bus thinned out, I
was able to get a better View of this most
unusual individual. And suddenly I real-
ized that my initial assessment of the sit-
uation was quite inaccurate. In fact, it
was not a coconut laying in the old man’s
lap. It was the nut-brown head of a little
boy —— the rest of whose body had been
hidden from my vision by the tangle of

MICHAEL J.

MAZZA

S'l‘Al-‘l-' W Rl'l‘l-L R

 

bodies that had been on the bus.

So suddenly the picture was quite
different. This gentleman was no deviant
coconut fondler. No, it was more likely
he was simply a loving grandfather, gen-

‘ tly stroking the head of his tired grand-

son as the boy took a short nap
on the bus. It was quite a relief
to see this Norman Rockwell-
esque scene replace the Spike
Jonze-ian vision that had previ-
ously been lodged in my brain.

But in retrospect, I wonder: Would it
in fact be so weird for someone to lov-
ingly stroke ,a coconut? Think about it.
The coconut is really quite a wonderful
thing. From its milk we can make .pin‘a
coladas, coconut cream pies and other

delicacies. From its succulent ﬂesh we

get tempting Mounds and Almond Joy
candy bars. From its hollowed-out shell

I we can create a charming bowl.

Yes, when I think about all the won-
derful things we can. get from the
coconut, I don’t see coconut fondling as
such a deviant activity. Heck, it actually
seems downright normal. I

But you don’t need to think about the
coconut’s practical uses to be inspired to
give it an amorous caress. The coconut,
after all, is -like all of us —— a child of
Mother Earth.

In the brown arc of its shell we can
see reflected the comforting fecundity of
that common womb. Indeed, stroking a
coconut becomes a ritual of moral and
spiritual richness.

So if you happen to meet a coconut
fondler on the bus, or in the produce
department, don’t be so quick to con-
demn him. In fact, consider stroking one
yourself.

Michael Mazza apologizes to the estate
of Ernest Hemingway for any uninten-
tionalpsimilarlity between the title of this
column and the title of one of the late
Nobel laureate ’s classic works.

  Bush’s . plan cuts a break  

to those who

I The tax issue raises a fundamental,
question about the ‘way American citi-

zens will insist to be treated by their

government. Are we a nationof grown- A

ups or are we a country of children
whose will and resources are subject to
the control of a Big Brother govem—

A vast majority of
Americans agree that taxes
are far too high. The Tax,
Foundation has reported that
middle-class working farm-
lies ‘now surrender over 38 percent of
their income to federal, state and local
taxes. Americans haven’t experienced a
level of taxation this high since World
"War II’s end. In fact, we are currently
experiencing thehighest peacetime tax
burden in U.S.‘history. r .

In order‘ to remedy this situation,
taxes must be substantially reduced.
Gov. George W. Bush has presented a
tax out plan’ that -will benefit all

T. Americans and leave the Social Security
surplus untouched. Bush’s tax plan
focuses on cutting marginal ’ tax rates,
thereby lowering thetax burden of each
and every individual .who currently pays

- fe"deral’income taxes?’ ' _-

' ' Conversely, Vice President Al Gore

. hasproposed a tax out plan that involves.

more taxing than cutting. His plan only’

cuts your taxes if you ﬁt his rather nar- V.
~ row deﬁnition of deserving.
V The existing level of taxation is so ,

high that on average, families now pay

,more in taxes than they spend on food, _

clothing I and housing combined.
‘Americans, on average, now work over
four months out of the ‘year to fund. our
bloated and mismanaged govemmentj ' ’

_, ‘ Thosepon the left pretend to care

— -about working individuals. Yet at the

safne time they support programs that
rob rniddle-class. families of four months
of their income. Bush’s tax plan would
"allow families to keep more of their
earnings allowing them to improve their
standard of living. A -

 Gore’ ‘and other liberal Democrats

make,-thegclaim that,Bush’s tax-cut pro- -

iposal does not allow-—f_'or the reduction of

patently false. Bush’s:plan will actually

are decreased,,actuial' revenue ‘increases. -‘

This is .exactly What occurred in . the

cally increased and far outpaced the
growth in revenue. I f

Gore’s plan calls for the creation or 0

expansion of 200 government programs
that would amount to an additional $2
‘ trillion in _
spending over 10 years. Is
this any way to pay off the
debt?
A favorite argument of
’ liberal Democrats is that
Bush’s tax plan beneﬁts only the wealth-
ie_st'Americans. The fact of the matter is

‘the top five percent of wealthiest tax-

payers pay approximately 47' percent of

all income taxes. The top 10 percent pay ‘
income taxes.-

59 percent of all
Conversely, the bottom 50 percent‘ pay
only ﬁve percent of ‘total income taxes.
Critics of the Republican proposals
have hit the airways saying the top one

‘percent receive more tax cuts. than the M
combined‘ bottom 60’ percent. But IRS

ﬁgures show that the top 1 percent pay

C, 29 percentof all income taxes It would

seem equitable, then, that the top 1 per-

‘ cent would get not just more, but triple
the cut.

It’s difﬁcult to give a tax cut to per-’
sons contributing only ﬁve‘ percent of _

tax revenues." To do so requires giving

, away money. That_’s exactly what Gore ,
and the far left want to happen. They

want to usethe tax code to redistribute
wealth from those who - pay taxes to
those who do not. This amounts to a tax-

payer-funded welfare program. : When .

Apparently Gore did not take the hint.

Indulge me for a moment, please; on
the subject of tax relief. -
Imagine that two men in well-tailored
suits approach you and‘ ask you to make a

simple choice — to pick one man’s offer .

over the otl1er’s. The first man offers you
a tax deduction of up to $10,000 per year
for college tuition. The second man
offers you enough money to buy a can of
Mountain Dew —— 62 cents, to be exact.

Ilcnow what you’re, thinking -—. what
kind of choice is that? _

Well, it’s the choice you’ll have to

I make this November. Speciﬁcally, it’s the

choice you’ll make atthe polls as you
vote for your presidential candidate,
hopefully considering his tax relief "plan
when you make your choice.

, To this end, let me enlighten you.
The first man .in our simpliﬁed hypothet-

ical situation is V.lC6 President Al Gore,

and the second is Gov. George W. Bush,-
R-Texas. I assure you, these are two men
with very different ideas‘ about who in
America deserves what and in what
quantity. - 
For instance, Bush thinks that the

I wealthiest ‘l percent of America" deserves

43 percent of his $1.3 trillion tax cut. In
other words, _that’s $550 billion handed
out to the richest people in America. ’
But let’s not talk about
Bush. Frankly, I‘ ﬁnd ‘- even
thinking about him .mildly
nauseating. Let’s  about
Gore. - .
To begin with, Al Gore ,

   

. wants targeted tax relief. This is by far
.preferable to simply treating tax relief

like slash and burn agriculture, in which
the. government would simply rampage

rtrmigh the budgetary jungle,» slashing

through taxes with no. regard for who
needs relief and who actually gets it. The

 beneﬁt. of targeted tax relief is that — fol-
»-low. me closely here ——-_ it is targeted, thus

~ ensuring that speciﬁc needs are met. In

V this way, those who need relief most are

=-sureto get it. ‘

I f . Examples of how Gore wants to tar-

get his proposed $500 billion in tax cuts
include: ,

0 an expansion of the Earned Income
Tax Credit, delivering tax relief to 6.8

million families, which builds on the
» EIT C expansion that provided relief for

15 million families in 1993. .
- a 25 percent refundable tax credit to

‘ people lacking access to employer—based

health care ’  ~ -
0 a $3,000 tax credit that would go

SPIHER -

thosewho need the most  

toward providing‘ formal and informal
long-term care for about two million ill

and disabled Americans, the first initia-

tive ever to acknowledge Americans with
such needs. “
° and, of course,‘ my fellow students,

there’s good-news for us too. Gore has
proposed — putyour ear right up to the‘

page, because I’m going . to yell it --
making $10,000 worth of college tuition
tax—deductible annually! Woo-hoo!
According I to www.algore.com, “[under
Gore’s] proposal, Americans will be able
to save money for education with Tuition
Savings Accounts [that are] tax and inﬂa-
tion-free. This proposal would make tax-
free, inﬂation-protected savings accounts
for college more accessible and transfer-
able as families, move from state to state.”
I don’t know about you, but that sounds
good to me.

‘ A On a final note, you may be asking,
“OK, but why not the Bush plan?”
Perhaps in the end, the best answer is not
because it is unfairly proportioned, so
that people earning $900,000 each will

. receive $50,000 in the Bush tax cut,

while some of the lowest income families
in America would receive onlymarginal
relief, equating to the aforementioned 62

~~ cents a day. Nor is it because the Bush A

plan leaves only $422 billion
in the budget for education,
health care, prescription
drugs and defense combined.

Bush allots tax breaks

ment against his tax cut is that people
don’t want it. A Fox-News poll showed

that only 25 percent of people would give
a themselves a tax cut, while 65 percent

would give the money to Medicare and
Social Security funding. A CNN/Time
poll showed that only 21' percent of“
Americans are in favor of a tax cut}
whereas 74 percent would give the
money to Social Security and other
nationally “unmet needs.”

So here’s my advice. Register to
vote. Then get out to the polls and vote
for Gore, the candidate with the tax plan
Americans need —— and want. Finally,
come Election Day, buy your own cans
of Mountain Dew, and raise them in a

> toast when the better man wins.

Sabrina Spiher would like to mention

that, regarding the election, Bush

once said: “If it comes down to Smart Al

vs. Dumb George, I can live with that.”

SYRACUSE, N.Y.—-A broken play broke the
heart of the Pitt Panthers Saturday evening, as

-Troy Nunes threw a 23-yard pass to David Tyree J

in the second overtime to lead Syracuse over
Pitt, 24-17. ‘

After beingvsacked by Bryan Knight for’ a
loss of 17‘yards on the previous play, Nunes was
faced with a third-and-goal. Rolling to the right,
he found no one open. He reversed field and ran
all the way back to Pitt’s 45-yard line, where he

got a great block _from fullback Chris Davis to-

avoid a sack. Nunes then found Tyree in_ the back
of the end zone for what proved to be the win-
ning score.

“It’s very disappointing,’

said Knight, who

was chasing Nunes down; before he threw the‘
touchdown pass. “It was a wild play. That’s all It

can say.” ’ .
p Pitt- had a chance to tie the game, but a
fourth-and-3 pass attempt by John Turman was

-behind receiver.Antonio_ Bryant, as the 40,699
‘fans in attendance at the Carrier Dome roared

with excitement.

Turman’s incomplete pass ended a marathon
game that_1asted overrfourhours and featured

chances to wi-nthe game, but missed field goals

at the end of regulation and in the first overtime"

Pitt loses, to Syrase,24-17, in thriller

period.’ Shafer also missed two other field goals
in regulation. '

Pitt kicker Nick Lotzhad his shareof prob-
lems. Lotz" missed an extra point with Pitt up 9-
0 early in the game. Lotz also had a 37~yarder in
the fourth quarter that went wide left, and in the
first overtime, he missed a 31-yard kick that
could have put Pitt in the-lead. ﬂ .

‘ “I’m yery proud of our team and our perfor-

mance,” Syracuse head coach Paul Pasqualoni‘

said.
Pitt tookvan early lead when Lotz nailed a

'career—high 48-yard field goal just.3 minutes and

41, seconds in the game.» The lead,was—extended
when Pitt got a 12 play, 67-yard "drive that ended
with Turman scrambling up the middle for an 18-
yard touchdown run to put‘Pitt up 9-0.

“I just saw that hole up the middle and went
for it,” Turman said. “Therway we spread out the
offensemade that easy for me.”

The" Panthers were clinging to a 9-3 lead in
the second quarter when Nunes worked his
magic for the first time in the contest. After
evading the_ Pitt rush, Nunes rolled to his right
and lofted the ball up "for Tyree, who caught the
ball just past the outstretched arms of Pitt
defender William Ferguson and ranit in for a 65-
yard touchdown pass.

Syracuse went up 17-9 in the third quarter
when James Mungro ran it in from 5 yards out,
but then Turman tied the game almost single-

handedly inthe fourth quarter.

propel Pitt to victories over teams like Penn
State and Notre Dame. -

Turman found Brennan Carroll for a first
down on a key third—down play early in the
drive. Then, he hit Bryant on a 4-yard slant pat-
tern on a fourth—and-2 play. A few plays later, he
was once again faced with a fourth down, but he
found Latef Grim for a first_down. ‘

Then, on third~and—goal,. Turman hit R.JV.
English, who dragged a defender into the end
zone with him, making the score 17-15.

Pitt needed a two-point conversion to tie the
game. With some confusion on the sidelines and
no timeouts, Turman snapped the ball with just
10 Panthers on the field. Despite being one man

‘down, Turman found English with two defenders

on him for the conversion.

But Pitt’s efforts didn’t stop there. Two
penalty ﬂags were thrown on the play. The first
was for defensive pass interference, and the sec-
ond was on the offense, for an illegal man down-
field. The penalties offset each other, meaning
the play had to be redone.

Forced to. tie the game a second time, Turman
and the Panthers came to the line with five wide
receivers. Seeing that no one was in front of him,
Turman took the snap and ran straight. up the
middle for the conversion to even the score.

packed the. Fitzgerald Field House Sunday

after a-fifth-game win over Syracuse the day

Orangemen were able to overcome
Shafer’s inaccuracy in the 24-17
victory. T _ 

Pasqualoni was pleased with his
team’s effort, but when asked what
he told Shafer after the game, he
became solemn.

“I told him that next week, we

might need him to make a game-

winning field goal so he’d better be

' ready,” Pasqualoni said, describing

the conversation between him and
the kicker. _
In the Orangemen’s first four

games, Shafer hit on just 2—of—5.
» field goal attempts, with hislongest

being a 35-yarder.
Earlier in the game on Saturday:
though, Shafer was good on his

‘ first attempt, a career ‘long of 37

yards.

“He hit the first one,” Syracuse
wide receiver Maurice Jackson
said. ‘-‘Then, he had some bad luck.’’

Bad _ luck‘ was one" way to
explain it, but for a guy that has

only hit 3—of-10 attempts on the-

season, it could have been a repre-
sentation of how important kickers
are _to the game of football.

“You can’t expect to win miss-

A ing four field goals in a row, but we

did,” Jackson said. .
1 Pitt’ had its own‘ kicking prob-

‘ lem to overcome.
f Junior Nick Lotz missed _two V

field. goals, one in the first overtime
from 31 yards, and an extra pointin
the first “quarter. That was aft_er
Lotz began the game by nailing a
career-high, 48-yard field goal in
the first quarter.‘ ' .

The extra point was his first
miss in 25 attempts, and Pitt head

A coach Walt Harris summed up the

kicking craziness by saying that

“anything can happen.” , »

Anything did happen to Shafer

, and Lotz as they combined to make

just 2-of-8 field goals in the con-

. Pasqualoni expressed fu1lconfi—

1» dence in Shafer afterwards and did
not hint at any possibility of replac- V
. inghim. ‘

. Pitt may have gotten lucky in its’
29-17 win over Rutgers on Sept. 23
after turning the ball over seven
times, but it was Syracuse that had
luck onlits side-during Saturday’s
game. - ‘ ~
Four missed field goals would
keep most Division I coaches up at

‘night, but not Pasqualoni.

“-We’ll go. back to work on
Monday.,”5 Pasqualoni said. “We
havefaith in Mike.”

While his statistics. aren’t

' impressive, Shafer still has the sup-
, port of -his head coach. 1

‘But U2 also sang in one of its

songs that “love is blind.”

COLUMN   

from a 3-0-deficit in a 5-3 win over,
ironically, Columbus.

- New York City, which has the
highest population of Italian-
Americans anywhere in the country,
saw one of its baseball teams, the
Yankees, have their immediate
future in the playoffs decided by an
Italian-American. ,

I wonder who the five million
Italians in the New York area were
rooting for? . ’

Actually, that’s a stupid ques-
tion because New Yorkers don’t
know Oakland pitcher Barry Zito

from Mona Lisa Vito of “My

Cousin Vinny” fame.
_ Zito pitched 5 2/3 innings,

 

 

allowing just one run in Saturday

night’s 11-1 win for the A’s.

With an imposing stare that

‘Tony Soprano would be proud of,
. Zito dominated the Yankees, while

forcing a fifth and final game in the
American League Divisional Series.
0 Two of Zito’s teammates,
brothers Jeremy and Jason Giambi,
aren’t doing too badly in the series
against New York. » ’ ,
Jeremy is hitting .375 against

the Yanks, while Jason, anlMVP
candidate, is hitting .300. j

The last pair of Italian brothers
to combine for that so many hits in
just under a week’s time had to be
Michael and Sonny Corleone.

° While I hate to say it, I have to
give credit to Paul Pasqualoni, yet
another Italian—American, as his

.17.
--Syracuse Orangemen found a way
to win against the Panthers
Saturday.

It’s only_ fitting that, on the
weekend before Columbus Day,
Pasqualoni and his“ team defeated
Pitt for the ninth straight time at the
Carrier Dome.

Who was the quarterback when

‘Pitt last won at the dome? ‘

Of course it was Dan Marino,
Oakland native and yes, an Italian-
American, '

Isn’t it strange how that works
out sometimes?

Mario Machi is the sports editor of
The Pitt News, and he will be skip-
ping class today in honor of
Columbus Day, since the University
will not grant students the day off.

that all by himself.”

With just over a minute remain-
ing, it appeared the ga_me would be
headed for overtime. But Syracuse
was not done.

On its first play of the ensuing
drive, Nunes threwthe ball away
just as he was getting hit, garnering

FROM PAGE 13

‘an-intentional grounding call from

the referee.

'That set up a second down with
24 yards to go, and Syracuse
seemed ready to just run‘ the clock
out and go to overtime. Nunes
hande‘d off to Mungro, who ran 37
yards off-tackle to give Syracuse
another chance.

After passes to Malik Campbell

llclollel’
11 8.14

and Pat Woodcock, Shafer trotted
onto the field for his fourth field

"goal attempt of the day.

With three seconds on the clock,
the kick was no good, sending the
game into overtime. 1

Syracuse won thetoss and elect-
ed to play -defense first in the over-
time.

Pitt got a first down and moved
the ball to the Syracuse 13-yard
line, where Lotz missed his second
field goal of the day. _

The possession for ' the
Orangemen nearly -mirrored that of
Pitt. : ' .

There were a few first downs,
but then -Shafer. missed a 36-yarder
that would have won the game.

’In the second overtime, Pitt was
on defense first. Syracuse began

with an 18-yard pass" from Nunes to

Woodcock, but then Knight sacked
Nunes two plays later,‘ setting up

~ the eventual game-winning play.

“We’re notdevastated. We’re
not disappointed,” said Bryant, who
had seven catches for 135 yards.
“We’ve just got some work to doll”

Harris gave credit to the

Orangemen for the victory, which.

moved them to 3-2 overall and 1-0
in the Big East.
“Troy Nunes made a play to win

the game,” Harris said. “You have '
to give credit to Syracuse for doing.
what it takes tonight.”

The loss drops Pitt to 4-1 on the

‘season.
