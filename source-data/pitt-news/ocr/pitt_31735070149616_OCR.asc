Gov. Tom Corbett’s recently pro— l
posed $27.4 billion -state budget
shows that both he and the state Re-

publican-Party are out of touch with .

reality, a member of the Pennsylva-
nia Democratic Party told a group of
students Thursday evening.

Jim Burn, chairman of the Penn-
sylvania Democratic Party, spoke to
a group of about 20 ‘students in the
Barco Law Building for a conference

, held by the Pitt College Democrats.

Atithe hour-long conference, Burn
talked about his stance on Corb ett’s
proposed 30 percent cut _to Pitt’s
state funding, as well as the national
Republican Party.

Burn said this year’s budget is the
second in a row that targets public
education in the state. He added that
the most recent proposed budget,
with a 30 percent cut for three out
of the four state-related institutions,
places an added burden on higher
education in the state.

If the state passes the 30 percent
cut in its ﬁnal budget, the total per-
centage of state cuts to Pitt over the
past I2 months would be 49 percent
— very close to Corbett’s original
proposed so percent cut to the Uni-
versity last year.

The chair of Student Govern-
ment Board’s Governmental Rela-
tions-Committee, Robert Beecher,
said Burn’s, sentiments indicate
the need for a response from Pitt

Without land, 0ccupy_strugg|es tofighton    

By Em Maier"
For the Pitt’ News

On Sept. 17, 2011, 1,o0Q protest-
ers gathered in lower Manhattan

to protest corporate greed. That

protest evolved-into the Occupy

Movement and has since become a

‘ worldwide phenomenon that advo-

cates what it claims is the message
of the 99 percent. ,

But only ﬁve months later,

the movement’s state is unclear.

Numerous Occupy movements, -

ranging from the original New
York site in ZuccottiPark to camps
in Washington, Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh have been evicted from

their plots. The Allegheny Court
of Common Pleas recently evicted
Occupy Pittsburgh’s camp at BNY
Me1lon’s Downtown Mellon Park.
On ‘Feb. 6, two days after Judge
Christine Ward issued an injunc-
tion for the group’s removal from

the bank’s property, the protesters —
Vacated the land they’d occupied _

since Oct. 15.
“As camps start to break down,

' the visibility of the movement will

surely be negatively impacted,”
said Pitt political science profes-
sorjennifer Victor. ’

Lucas Lyons, a graduate stu-
dent at Pitt and a member of Oc-
cupy Pittsburgh, said the evictions
would not affect the movement.

W After evictions, Occupy movement hopes to keep itselfin the public eye 4

“The camps were only a sym-
bol, a metaphor, for the message
we are trying to wake peopleup
to. When the camps shut down,

, only the symbol was gone,” he said.

“Everything else continues on. We
have built networks both physi—
cally and over the Internet, and we

will continue to push our message .

through different avenues.”

Jackie Smith, a sociology pro-
fessor at Pitt involved with Oc-
cupy Pittsburgh, said that while
the loss of camps might negatively
affect the movement, she is hope-
ful for the future and thinks the
eviction could be beneﬁcial in the
long run.

“The camp actually required

a lot of energy and focus to de-
fend. This kept many people from

thinking about the long—term vi—.
. sion of building a movement that

can resonate with and connect to

the needs of more diverse groups

in'our community. Also, by keep-
ing the focus on [Mellon Park] as
the main space we were occupy-
ing, we missed an opportunity to
highlight some of the manyiother
occupations that are happening in
this‘ city and region.”

Gibbons also spoke about government re-
form inPennsylvania.’He said he is pushing for
a unicameral state legislature because it would
be more efficient and less expensive. By elimi-
nating both the House and Senate, there could
instead be one larger chamber that has smaller
districts so legislatures could connect with their
constituents.
Duringthe Q&A session, Gibbons addressed
the Marcellus Shale impact fee, which would al-
low local municipalities to tax gas wells. Corbett

passed the fee two weeks ago, but Gibbons, who
said he was with his wife who was giving birth to
- their second child at the time, did not vote.
Gibbons said that some Democratic legisla-
tors called the impact fee too low of a tax, while
other Democrats have said it was good to pass
any sort of tax_.
“It’s hard to turn down the money, and it
_ should have been more. Some say it’s a bit of
a win for the governor to even sign off on it.
I might have voted for it. I don’t know,” Gib-
bons said. ’ A
Adrienne Spillar, a graduate religious stud-
ies student who attended the breakfast, said
although any kind of fee is a good thing, the
environment must also be considered.
. “In the long term, the environment is ne-

glected for corporate interests,” Spillar said. I ‘

“The best way that we can have an effect is
by going to Harrisburg, showing our power as a
group and showing representatives that we are
passionate about this issue,” Beecher said.
Unlike last year, Burn said Corbett_’s own

T party isn’t as willing as he is to make cuts to

higher education.
“There doesn’t seem to be too much passion

in Harrisburg for what the governor wants,” .

Burn said. “House Republicans are on the run
with their elections coming up.”

Burn also took time to take aim at the
candidates for the Republican presidential
nomination. . ‘

‘‘They’re all ﬁghting over who’s the most
conservative or who’s the most Christian,”
Burn said. “Its like Al Sharpton said during
the 2008 election, ‘The Republicans are more
obsessed with what’s going on in thebedroom
than what’s going on the kitchen table.’’’

Burn said the recent shift in ideology by

A Republicans coincides with the resurgence of

said, is a result of efforts by Obama to slowly

STBCKING WW NECK OUT ' 

Politicians should embrace VAWA

S GOP opposition to the Violence Against Women Act is inexcusable

  

By Tracey Hickey '
Columnist

 
 

Whatwould ittake toturntheViolence
Against Women Act, which enjoyed
overwhelmingcongressional support

since Bill Clinton ﬁrst signed itin1994 L

and helped increase reportage of do-
' mestic violence by 51 percent, into
partisan legislation?

Simply put, not much. The new
incarnation of the Violence Against
Women Act, sponsored by Sens. Pat-
rick Leahy (D—Vt.), whois on the Sen-
atejudiciary Committee, and Michael

A Crapo (R-Idaho), who is not, passed
the Judiciary Committee earlier this
month on a party line vote of-7.10-8.
Apparently, expanding visa options
for abused immigrants and forbid-
ding domestic violence centers that
receive government ﬁmding from
turning away victims on the basis of
sexual orientation or gender identity

_ are so controversial that not a single
Republican in the Committee could
bring hirnselfor herselfto reauthorize
the Act. , Q
. The reauthorization modestly in-
creases the availability of the VAWA

Self-Petition, which allows immigrant ;

women in abusive marriages to ap-
ply for legal immigration status for

Sen. (_’l1.u'|«.:r~, (ll‘..If—.‘.lL‘_‘,-’ / :VlC'l'L1a|npus

themselves and their children with-
out the knowledge or permission of
their abusers. Domestic violence ex-
perts have applauded the expansion,
as in the United States
are uniquely vulnerable to partner

violence. According tothe Family -

Violence Prevention Fund, roughly
60 percent of married and 50 per-
cent ofunmarried immigrantwomen
have experienced physical or sexual
abuse. And between 1995 and 2002,
51 percent of NewYork City’s intimate
partner homicide victims were born
outside America.

Abusive partners of immigrants
frequently usetheirvictims’ immigra-
tion status as a means of control —_—

. for example, by hiding or destroying

important papers  and green
cards or threatening to report the vic-
tim to the immigration authorities.
Before the original Violence Against
Women Act and the creation of the
VAWA Self— Petition, an undocument-
ed immigrant married to a citizen or
long-term resident would be depen-
dent on her spouse, no matter how
violent, to apply for legal residency
on her behalf. The VAWA Self-Petition
provides an alternative, and the new
expansions make that alternative easi-
er for women in danger to access.
Yet Sen. Charles Grassley, ranking
Republican on the Senate Judiciary

._ Committee, can’t support reauthoriz-
ing VAWA because he believes this’

modest expansion of visa access will
be “manipulated as apathway to U.S.
citizenship for foreign con artists and
criminals.”

Grassley also called the new provi-
sion ensuring LGBTQ victims aren’t
discriminated against by organiza-
tions receiving government funding
“a solution in search of a problem 
a political statement that §houldn’t

be made on a bill that is designed to “

address actual needs of victims” and
insisted that advocates of the new
protections haven’t produced any
evidence that discrimination against
LGBT victims is a real phenomenon.
Grassley evidently didn’t ask the
National Coalition of Anti-Violence
Programs, which conducted a sur-
vey ﬁnding that 85 percent of service
providers have worked with domes-
tic violence victims who have been
denied service on the basis of their
sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity. Additionally, 91 percent worked
with Victims who were discriminated
against by domestic violence organi-
zations, and 64 percent had worked
vvithvictims who were discriminated
against by law enforcement. Con-
sidering that, according to the same
Coalition, the incidence of domestic

from the prevalence of violence in heterosexual

Although Grassley and the otherjudiciary
Committee Republicans claim that fhey’re only
stallingthis lifesaving legislation so as to protect
govemment—funded agencies’ right to discrimi-

really supported VAWA to begin with. The sub-

E LGBT protections and expanded visa options

but proposed a huge reduction in authorized
ﬁnancing and called for the elimination ofthe

Justice Department Oﬂice on Violence Against A

Women, which is responsible for actually.en—.

Thankfully, of course, the reauthorization
passed the Senatejudiciary Committee anyway.
According to the bill’s co—sponsors, VAWA en-

joys more bipartisan support in the full Senate.

‘ T One of the major co-sponsors is a Republican,

as are four of its 34 co—sponsors, and Crapo is
optimistic that the reauthorization will pass in

Justice Department reports that roughly three

and accordingto the Associated Press, homicide
is the leading cause of death for pregnant women
in America — and that’s only the cases that
escalate to horriicide. Protections and services .
for victims of domestic violence are absolutely

essential, and anyonewillingtothrowthemout ‘

the window just to spite LGBTpeople is no friend
to women or anyone else in this country. Let’s
hope that common sense and compassion -— or,’
barring that, election—year motivations — will
compel GOPsenators to act responsibly when

Senior Staff Writer

When Pittrmen’s basketball met
the Louisville Cardinals injanuary,
both programs desperately needed
to turn their seasons around.
The Panthers didn’t. The Car-
dinals did. ' 1
No. 17 Louisville'(21-6; 9-5 Big

_ East) can sweep the season series .

against reeling Pitt (15-13, 4-11 Big
East) when the two schools meet

' Sunday at 2 p.m. at the KFC Yum!

Center.
Louisville’s 73-62 win at Pitt
on Jan. 21 began a six-game in-

conference win streak for the Car- —

dinals, helping the team rise to a
half-game behind Georgetown for
adouble-bye in next month’s Big
East tournament.

The Cardinals have used a bal-

anced, deep lineup to climb in the‘

standings since dropping ﬁve of
seven games in late December and
early January. Four players aver-
age double-digit points per game,
paced by Kyle Kuric’s'13.3 and Russ
Smith’s 12. _

Kuric, a senior, had 21 points
and ﬁve rebounds in Louisville’s

win at Pitt last month when a ten-

- der ankle forced him to take more

perimeter shots than typical for
the 6-foot-4 forward. ’

The’ Cardinals overcame. a
17-point ﬁrst-half deﬁcit to win in
overtime at DePaul last Saturday,
90-82. Louisville plays at Cincin-
nati Thursday night. ,

The Panthers, meanwhile, en- .

ter the weekend on a four-game
losing streak that guarantees they
will play on the opening day of the

Big East tournament. The most re- 1

cent defeat came Sunday to South
Florida, 56-47, Pitt’s seventh home
loss this season. ’

Pitt’s problems on offense run
deep. - '

“offensively, not getting to the
free—throw line, not getting in the
lane and not ﬁnishing baskets are
some of the things that have hurt
us all year and tonight,” Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon said after the

‘ loss to the Bulls.

Pitt, the top rebounding team
in the Big East, had 12 offensive
boards against South Florida, but
the Bulls still held the Panthers to
under 50 points for their second
consecutive game. . »

Dixon said that ﬁnishing put-
backs and second chances has
been an issue.

“We have been getting offensive

-rebounds, but we don’t seem to be

getting the production that goes
with that,” he said.

Sophomore ].]. Moore scored
a career—high 21 points in the loss

- to South Florida and shot a perfect

3-for-3 from the ﬁeld in a 66-48

' loss to West Virginia last Thurs-
day. Moore said Sunday that he‘

thinks he can continue to build
off his strong individual perfor-
mances. ,

“It’s definitely something I

‘can build off of. My teammates

gave me the conﬁdence and told
me to just be aggressive and at-
tack the rim,” Moore said. “I just
tried to bring a lot of energy off

‘ the bench and get us the win, but

we fell short.”

Dixon said Moore has played
better both with the ball and with-
out it. ' _ A ' V .

“He is getting to the basket as
far as cutting and moving without
the ball -and has gotten a couple
breakaways,” Dixon said. “He has
been playing better defense ﬁrst

and foremost. That’s good to see'_

for a sophomore as he is going

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Notre Dame on nine-
game Winning streak  

Irish head coach Mike Brey has his team rolling

With just over two weeks until Se-
lection Sunday —— the day when the

NCAA Tournament Selection Com— .

mittee releases its annual bracket

to decide which 68 teams will com— ~

pete for the National Champion-
ship —— it’s time for the 16 teams in
the Big East Conference to prove
themselves.

At least 10 of those teams be—'

lieve that an at-large bid into the
Tournament is a real possibility, but
the remaining six teams — includ-

. ing Pitt — could

been on an even more impressive
run than Syracuse. Head coach
Mike Brey has done’ an incredible
job with Notre Dame this season,
and it’s scary to think that the
team has spent the better part of
‘this season without injured star
Tim Abromaitis. As Wednesday’s
dominating performance against
West Virginia showed, the Irish’s
success this season should no lon-

ger be a surprise. , .. ..

Panthers still searching for first Big East Conference win

Pitt is in danger of not winning two Big East games for the flTSt time under head coach Agnus Berenato.

Byjasper Wilson
Staﬁ" Writer

During head coach Agnus Berenato’s nine years
at Pitt, the women’s basketball team has won
at least two Big East games each season.
Withjust two conference games remaining
inthe regular season, the Panthers (8-19, 0-14
Big East) hope to avoid becoming the ﬁrst team
to fail to reach that mark by picking up a win
against Seton Hall (7-21, 0-14 Big East) at the
Petersen Events Center on Saturday.

The Pirates haven’t won a conference con-

test either, and with both teams pursuing that
elusive ﬁrst victory, Pitt freshman point guard
Brianna Kiesel said she expects a battle.

“Both teams are going to play hard,” she
said. “Ev_eryone’s just going to leave it on the
court.” ‘

With the Big East Tournament just a week
away, a win would help build crucial momen-
tum for the young Pitt team before its ﬁrst
round match-up. -

Seton Hall has the lowest scoring average
in the league, scoring 54.1 points per game.
That’s good news for Pitt: The Panthers have
struggled defensively, allowing a conference-
worst 70.1 points per game.

But despite Seton Hall’s low offensive out—

Pitt sophomore Asia Logan underwent sur-

“We let them know exactly how we felt

The Panthers performed better in the second

half, getting outscored by a slimmer margin: .

her team is losing. A .
“Do Iwant to win?” Berenato said. “Yeah,

' Kiesel, already a leader for the Panthers,
said she knows what she has to do to keep
spirits high and for the team to succeed. . 5

”I just have to lead by example,” Kiesel said.-
“That’ll bring everyone else to keep working

Kiesel said she doesn’t expect the rest
of her seasons at Pitt to provide the same

“It won’t always be like this,” Kiesel said.
‘‘It’s not always going to be the season that
we’re having this time. We all have growing

just happens to be ours.”

“ She added that her teammates still have

though they have failed to do so recently.

“We haven’t been on awinning streak, but
I still think that we have that conﬁdence and
understanding that we can win and that we
are a good team,” Kiesel said. “We’re growing
and I think that we’re going to go out with a.
