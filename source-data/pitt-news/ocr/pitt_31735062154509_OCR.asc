Without undue excitement, seven-

fo_rward.to ta pledging period that
will be.the natural result of free

consequence of four days. of ‘fren-

' Fraternity ideals have been pre-

and also by a ‘series of group con-

In view of ‘the continued disagree-

ation W1tl‘lln7 the -Hut, this fact is of
Interest. Dr. S. B. Linhart, secre-

Stiident‘Protests Allayed

Division of the restricted space in

and new offices suggested for the
dean of‘ men and student activities,
set an obstacle in the way ‘of the.

The following is-the first of a. - -
series of articles on the results
of a- ques_tio1zna.i're sent, to all
woman who have been; gradu-

_a.t€_5d by the University from
 1898, until Febmwrq/,’ .

By Alice _ “Louise z:z....t..;.
Large ‘returns from the question-'

 

reported on" -the one distributed to
over? 1,000 -women by the vocational.
guidance committee of the Women’:
Self-Government ‘ Association. '
The questionaires were sent in
May, 1927_ to all women who ‘grad-

uated from.the University of"Pitts-

burgh with .a bachelor of science of
arts degree, over a. period from June
1928,-to February 1927.

Twenty? ‘of the thirty ‘graduating

; classes in ‘which women have grad-

uated, representing 66.6 percent‘,
increases the value" of the informa-
tion in hand- Returns _fro_m .-the
classes -of 1898, 1900, -1901, 1905,
19_o6, 1907 and 910 have not been;
received. All ot er classes, however,
are -well represented.  ' ' '
- _ Records Incomplete .
A When the writer set about‘it to
discover the total number of women
who have graduated fromthe Uni-
versity of--Pittsburgh she discovered
that there did not exist anywhere
a.- complete record of all women
‘g'raduates..Since this information is

‘'important' in such a study, -she ‘set

about to compile such ‘a record.
From old commencement programs,
from records "in the ofﬁce of the re-
co“der, from a directory issued. by
‘¥.he.General Alumni Association in
1916, from conversation with early
graduates, and from data in the. of-
ﬁce of; the dean of women, she pre-
pared what she believes to--be a com-

number of women to graduate. ‘from
the -University of Pittsburgh up’ to
the present time, 1928. p _
An interesting‘ fact concerning
this group ‘of alumnae. is that 183-of
them, or 42.4 per cent of the group,
attended some other institution of
higher learning before coming to
Pitt. 'l;he' group was very cosmo-
politan in its choice of schools‘, the
183 having attended 65 different col-
'le'ges.- We ﬁnd.-Penn State mentioned
most frequently’, nineteen alumnae
naming it as the school attended
before coming to_ Pitt; then follow
Pittsburgh Teacliers’ T raznirlg
School with 18;

with 10; Carnegie Institute, of
Technology with .8, and Allegheny
College with 6. . . 
_ - Girls Enter at 18 __ ,_
The average age at whicha; girl,
enters the University of "Pittsburgh
is -18,'with ages rangingall theway
from 115’ to 49. One aluinnaentered
at the age of 15 years and one at
49. The majority of girls come to
Pitt betw,een_18,,to,22 years of age

make any {radical departure from ._
things one should» ﬁnd in conven-

tional chamber inusic.A} A0-ur criticism
of this movement is not of the de-
parture, but .,th.at he didn't depart
far enough. If-. the composer had
refrained from adulterating his jazz
idiom with 'Amu'sl_cal conventionalities,
we feel that the whole thing would
have been much better;-as it is, Mr.

Carpenter's brainclilld is a bastard,.
not ‘knowing' whether his father be‘

Mr. Broadway or M. Paris.
’ The other number that we found

most’ interesting was Cesari Fr.anck’s‘

Piano Quintet, ' in the ‘ perfirmance
of: which Dallmeyer Russell played
‘the ﬁfthinstrument. We say "ﬁfth”
aclvisedly, for Mr. Russell did not
obstrude as a soloist but tempered

his playing so Athat he was a hat-

monious{.p‘art of the ensemble. Mr.
Russell is‘ always an impeccable
technician and his beautiful’ sing-
ing -tone in the lento was all that
we could wish. .

The work itself has all the thumb-
marks . of "Cesar Franck, that
strange iﬁgure‘ in modern music.
Phrases reminiscent of the sym-

phony ‘and the violin sonatajfrang

‘through the whole work‘, but if a.
composer is to be quoted where is

‘say about the work, but let it suf-

him in his _rapid..'.‘ rise by netting.

points, putting‘ the. three leaders

home game and a good crowd is ex-
pected ‘for the ‘event.

Since the game with Notre Dame,-
the Pitt coach has been using the
delayed oﬁ".en,se during. parts of

It is probable that Carlson will use.
this style at periods during the last-
two home games, but any serious
opposition‘ will ﬁnd the Panthers’
ready with their swift offensive dis_--

‘cff its defense and‘ runs up the
score in a short space ofptime.

‘ Eddie Baker has been‘ showing‘ 8.
fine form of basket -ba1l.in_ recent
games, and has been copping scor-
ing honors from Charley Hyatt. His
tally for’ recent games shows more
than ﬁve baskets for each game, and
his ardiiig ability is an asset to

another football man, is a recent‘ ad-
dition to the Panther ranks and has.
been used, on occasions asa substr-
tute guard. However‘, in the‘ Penn
State game, last Friday, he nelieved
Wunderlich early in the first period
and. turned in, a;_ remarkable show-
ing, playing like a veteran. for a
large portion of the fray.

Coach Kowallis’ Panther Cubs,
who garnered their eleventh victory
when they defeated the Penn State
Lion Cubs in the preliminary, last
Friday, will meet the Johnstown Ju-2
nior College five in the curtain rais-
er to tonight's‘ game. They meet the
Tartan Plebes in a. preliminary ‘on
Tuesday. Indications pointto an. un-
defeated record for the‘ Pitt Frosh
this season, most of the opposing‘
teams having fallen under comfort-.
able leads. The remaining games are
all with teams which have been met
before’ this season. ‘ ‘  .
