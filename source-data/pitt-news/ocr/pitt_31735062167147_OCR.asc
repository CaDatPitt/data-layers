Sen. Clark Speaks Before  

Student Opinion
Supports R. Kennedy
As Peace Candidate

_ by BRUCE LEVENSON

Democratic Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York,
last Saturday announced his candidacy for his party’s
Presidential nomination. He opposes President Lyndon
Johnson’s Vietnam war policy. Senator Kennedy seeks
a unification of the peace faction of his party with Sena-
tor Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota who threw his hat
into the Presidential ring last November.

Senator McCarthy, however, is not too enthused with
the idea of joining forces with Senator Kennedy. He is

SAM Raises
$2600 Sum

For Charity

The brothers of Sigma Alpha
tMu fraternity began a qu-est for
the national lbasketballl bounc-
ing champi:o=nshi~p at noon Fri-
day, March 15, in the middle of
Forbes Ave.

Staisey and Foerster, the Al-
legheny County Commissio-nens,
were there to begin the ball
bouncing with 70 -green clad
Sammy ‘brothers as the green
basketlball began its 27 hour
bounce. .

The real objective of the
“Bounce for Beats” project was
to raise money’ for the Heart
Fund. It is all pa.rt of a nation-
wide /program that is presently
being conducted by the national
office of Sigma Alpha Mu.

The green basketball was
bounced all night in front of the
KQV radio studio -and then
through the St. Bait-rick’s Day
parade. The Sammies not only
collected money in front -of the
KQV studio, but also sent bnoth-
ers to the major shopping cen-
ters around the area to collect
dcssations for the Heart Fund.
K« V radio also accepted pledges
pl '1ed in the from the sur-
rounding area. Over $2,600 was
collected for the Heart Fund
‘by the brothers of Sigma -Alpha
Mu.

wondering why Kennedy has
waited so long to lend his sup-
port.

A concensus of University
students feel that Senator Ken-
nedy is a lpol-itical opportunist.
But, they think he ‘is the only
suitable Presidential peace can-
didate who can win.

Ken Schueler, SG president
shares “the same skepticism as
everyone else as to why Ken-
nedy has decided to run.” He
asks why Kennedy has waited
so long to announce his candi-
dacy and ‘Why he refused to
support McCarthy before.”
Schueler is “not really sure he
can accept his (Kennedy's) deci-
sion to run.”

Ivan Abrams, head of the Stu-
dents for Peace has “never been
an admirer -of Senator Kenne-
dy,” but respects his “political
skill.” He calls Kennedy “an un-
princip-aled. man who is running
on an -anti-war policy only be-
cause of Senator McCarthy’s
good showing in New Hamp-
“shire.”

Bill Rosen, LA freshman also
think “that Kennedy is a po-
litical opportunist who has no
real ideas and i-s running, in-
stead, on the Kennedy name.”

Don Lampert, chairman for
Senator McCarthy for Choice
’68, also feels that Kennedy’s
candidacy is a good thing. He
thinks that “it is imperative for
the two (Kennedy and McCar-
thy) to work together” but fears
that Kennedy will cause “a split
in the anti-Johnson faction.”

“Vietnam is the cancer of our country,” charged United States Senator Joseph 
Clark, in a speech that demonstrated the gulf between the University community and th(
politicians of the previous generations. Repeatedly denouncing the War and Presiden
J ohnson’s handling of it, and at the same time saying that “I am in complete accord’
withrthe views of Senator Eugene McCarthy, Clark refused to abandon his support of th(
President for the Democratic nomination. This stubborness resulted in repeated booing .

which felt that Clark sahouldq

Morlan Probes African Apartheid

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

‘South Africa is rigidly divided
between blacks and whites. The
whites are in control and deter-
mine “the nature of -the black-
ness of Africa.” The whites are
forcing the blacks to “return to
triba.-lism.”

This View of the racial situa-

sented Fniday afternoon by Gail
Morlan. Mrs. Morlan has just
returned from two years in the
Republic of South Africa, where
she .and her “husband worked to
improve black-white relations.

Through their desire -to con-
trol the African masses, the
white leaders are diving the
black population, contends Mrs.
Morlan. Because they are being
forced to return to the tribalism,
the blacks are choosing Western
civilization. Their attitude is “to
be tribal is to be bound rather
than free," according to Mrs.
Morlan.

A definite lack of alternatives
for blacks exists in South Afri-
ca, according to Mrs. Morlan.
Political action on the part of
the blacks is forbidden. The
prospects for a successful revo-
lution are dim. Because of the
situation, it is difficult for the
blacks to maintain their integ-

rity.

  

South Africans don't appreci-
ate the depth of the racial prob-
lem in the US, -stated Mrs. Mor-
lan. The see the US as a sort of
“Mecca,” and they View racial
uprisings in the US as evidence
that deﬁnite po-s-sibsilit-ies exist
for American Negroes.

As an example of how blacks
can be liberated from ‘whites,

. Mrs. Morlan used the Front for

Liberation of Mozambique
(FR:ELIMO). The black people
of Mozambique had to either
ﬁght for their freedom or give
up hope of national dignity.
FRELIMO was a success be-
cause it combined military ac-
tion with education. It also uni-
ﬂed various forces in Mozambi-
que and enlisted outside aid.
“If one looks «at the future of
Africa]? stated Mrs. Morlan,
“one can «see an increase rather
than a decrease of liberation
movements until white govern-
ments are overthrown."

Moyer Characterized Young
People as ‘Hip’ Not ‘Hippie’

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

“The average high school and
college students are “hip,” not
“hippie,” declared Paul Moyer
to the high school journalism
clinic sponsored _|by the Pitt
News Saturday. Moyer is on
KDKA’s “Eyewitness News.”

“The real stories on campus
today are the students them-
selves,” Moyer stressed. “Stu-
dents are so aware of what is
going on, and they have more
inﬂuence on what is happening,"
he added.

have taken a- stand.

Saying nothing new, Clark 
summarized the ,major objec-
tions to the war that have been;
voiced by the McCarthy-Ful- .
br’ght faction for the last two 
years. “Vietnam-is primarily Ia}.
political war,” he said. “A mi:li- 
tary victory will leave the coun- 
try in ruins. If the bombing ,
were stopped everything U Thant S .
has been saying for years 

come true.”

Speaking with obvious sincer- 
ity, Clark continued on this line 

for quite some time. However,

-it was apparent to much of the 
audience that the role of dissen- 
ter -was somewhat new to Clark, 
who seemed constantly to couch A ,
his comments within the idiom H
of a more conventional .-poli-tical. 
style. At -one point he gave the 

standard politicians wave, both

arms upraised about his head. .

At others, he co-uldn’t seem to

resist giving a campaign speech, A ‘
citing his seniority in the Swen j
ate and his “I have been a stu- -_
dent of foreign policy all my”‘‘*
life, and now I consider myself, 

a graduate student,” he said.

He seemed slightly uneasy ‘
and tired in the academic set- 1?
ting, aware that he should speak 
at an intelligent level, but not 
quite believing‘ ‘it. He seemed i

almost to be trying on a new

skin, stretching this way and’ ’
that to see if it fit, his real eyes 
about an inch behind the eyes 
we saw, and his recognition of 

events seemed to be constantly
second or two behind his gaze.
The strain of his new stand on
Vietnam was evident.

Clark also spent a good deal ._
of time speaking on new draft 
legislation that he is planning 

to enter into Congress today.

Its basic premise is that draft- , 

age men should be called right

after -high school, -rather than 
calling the oldest eligibles ﬁrst; _j_'

He also felt that anyone who is
physically able to- serve should
be drafted.

Stokes Calls for Action

by BARRY J. SIILACHTER ‘
Mayor Carl B. Stokes rose
to speak before the Roose-
velt Day Dinner of the
Americans for Democratic

Action (ADA) amidst thun-
derous applause. Introduc-
duced by Mayor Joseph Barr
the -Cleveland mayor began to
look over certain aspects of the
Report of the Advisory Com-
mission on Civil Disorders. He
marked the report a ca.1l to ac-
tion, but he stated that he was
worried over the fate of it.

Mayor Stokes ask-ed the ques-
tion, ‘Can we carry out the com-
mission’s recommendation . . .
in View of the war in Vietnam?

“I say to you that we can af-
f-ord them. I say to you that
Vietnam provides a convenient
excuse for those who really do
not want or intend to do any-
thing. If there was no war in
Vietnam, these sam-e people
would ﬁnd Ianothe-r excuse — in-
ﬂation, too much government,
too high taxes, t-he welfare
state,” he stressed.

The Cleveland mayor went on
to say that “we cannot afford
not to act on the reco1nmenda-
tions of the recent report." The
very futures of our cities are at
stake, “because the cities are
the basis now of our way of life,
politically and culturally.” What
Stokes suggests is a massive
positive action in the areas of
education, employment, welfare
and housing.

“I, for one, am not tired of
the phrase ‘War on Poverty’ but
I am tired of mere skirmishes,
of token attacks and mere tar-
get practices,” he declared.

Also speaking at the ADA
dinner was Pennsylvania Sena-
tor Joseph Clark. Olark told t'he
ADA audience that they were
doing a ﬁne job as l-iberal Dem-
ocrats and that the real danger
in ’68 was not LBJ, but Rlichard
Millhouse Nixon.

“No candidate for Presi-
dent ought to articulate
what his policies are in Vi-
etnam. This public foreclos-
sure of options has prolong-
ed the war.” These words
were spoken in a debate over
Vietnam between (Dr. Richard
Cottam and Woody Turner last
V‘/ednesday evening. These a.re
the feelings of Mr. Turner, a
conservative who is supporting
Richard Nixon for President.

Mr. Turner feels that the Viet
Cong will continue to ﬁght, be-
cause they know that the Unit-
ed States will only retaliate to a
limited extent. “If the enemy
believes he nisks or the counter
acts would be intlolerarbsle or at
least tprohibitive he would be
much more ready to negotiate,”
Turner stated. Mr. Turner fur-
ther feels that there are three

round of negotiations.

The ﬁrstl prerequisite is to
make the enemy uncertain of
the exact response to one of his
attacks. Mr. Turner feels that
we should .at least “put the ene-
my to the trouble of making his
own estimates.” Secondly, we
should make sure the enemy is
uncertain of our maximum re-
sponse. By saying “we will not
send troops north,” all we do is
help the enemy. There .is no rea-
son to rule out any mode of war-
fare, says Mr. Turner.

The third prerequisite is to
convince the enemy that the re-
taliation will be strong enough
to make the attackers hesitant
to ﬁght. “If-vthese conditions

Vietnam today, we would be
able to negotiate and end 
war admirably,” contends Mr.
Turner.

Dr. Cottam, on the other hand, jy;
feels that “we should st-op the 
bombing and negotiate.” What
Dr. Cottam would -like to see is eff
a coalition government ruled by‘, 3
the neutral Bhuddists, with the I’
pro ea-st National Liberation 
Front also represented, and the 
pro west Catholics included for .,

the United States and its allies.

In response to Mr. 'I‘-urner’s 
policy, Dr. Cottam feels that  _4

licy would be ineffective. He

compares the people of North 
Vietnlam to the people of Bri- 
taian d-uring the second World 
War.

  A New Alternative

The New Hampshire primary showing of Senator
Eugene McCarthy and the announcement of Senator
Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential candidacy has
struck a resounding chord of excitement at the Uni-
versity. '

Senator McCarthy"s strong showing in New
Hampshire not only reveals the increasing unhappi-
ness concerning the war in Vietnam but also the great
effect that “student power" has on state and national

‘politics.

The Senator offered the people of New Hamp-

shire an alternative attitude to our somber situation _

today. He recently stated that “the President scoffs
at ‘nervous Nellies’ and uses the term ‘cut and run’
suggesting that people who disagree with him on

-Vietnam are somehow cowardly and afraid.”

The Senator from Minnesota, moreover, believes
that the U.S. must strive for a negotiated settlement
and a -cessation of the bombing of the North. He also
maintains that the war has had serious effects on our
society. “All of this has had a drastic effect on other
areas of our responsibility. We have failed to appro-
priate funds for the poverty program, housing, edu-
cation, and other national needs. Our Foreign aid

- program has been slashed and we face the specter of

inflation.”

These then are some of the serious problems gen-
erated by the war in Vietnam and we must agree
with Senator McCarthy that the only way to solve

. these thorns in our side is by getting out of Vietnam.

Senator McCarthy,lhowever, will never rasp away
the Democratic nomination from President Johnson.
It is with this point; that we must welcome the presi-
dential candidacy of Senator Robert Kennedy. His en-
try into the race will provide the added impetus that
may ultimately deny President Johnson's renomina-
tion.

A We have been waiting for these new political de-

velopments for we are tired and afraid of the conse-

quences of the war in Vietnam; we are tired of the
constant threat of the draft. In short, we want a
change. And change is now in the wind.

We have noticed to our dismay and sorrow, the

A slow disintegration-of leadership emanating from the -

Whi‘te_House. For almost four years, the U.S.ihas re-

I peatedly escalated the war. For almost four years.

we have sought military victory and we have achieved
military stalemate.

Even so, President Johnson remains obdurate.
He maintains that the U.S. will see the war through.
The President said Saturday that “we must meet our
commitments in the world and Vietnam. And we
shall. We are going to win. To meet the needs of our
fighting men in Vietnam we will do whatever is neces-

With statements such as these, we must question
the President’s continual position. Will the US. have
to destroy Vietnam to obtain military victory? Will
we have to continually.mourn the mounting loss of
American lives? ’

We cannot adhere ourselves to the illogical pro-
mulgations from the White House for we feel that

e the price of victory in Vietnam does not outweigh the

agony of death.

We urge students to support the candidacies of

A Senators Kennedy and McCarthy for the time of ques-
7 tioning is over. Now is the time to implement our

,”student power” by working ‘for a new leadership——
a leadership that will bridge the ever growing gulf of

I American society.

Candidates Play It Cool

By Marc Simon

Last week, unknown to
the general public, several
1968 presidential candidates
were in Pitts-
burgh for an
exclusive =inter-
view with the

ing conducted
that interview,
I would like to
report some of
the statements
and policies of
the candidates.

MARK
SIIVION

The ﬁnst question was, -of
course, the pressing problem of
the day: How much credibility
is there in the government's re
port that lEgypst-ian engineers
are using American beavers in
the construction of the Aswan
dam?

The ﬁrst to reply was Rich-
ard N-ixon. He was direct and
concise. He said, “How should I

know—I havent’s work for the
government for eight years.”

I put the -same question to
President Lyndon Baines John-
son. He replied, “My fellow
American, it h.as been said that
these beavers were American. I
tend to believe that they were
Texan.” .

ASTOUNDED «by their clear-
cut answers, I chose to move -on
to another question. I asked the
candidates how they would end
the war in Vietnam.

First to answer was Gover-
nor Reagan. His policy wa-s sim-
ple. He told me, “We can get out
of trouble by using a single
strategic move——punt on third
down.” I nodded in recognition
to this gem of political st-rategy.

I posed the same question to
ex-Governor George Wallace. He
seemed to feel that we were
“too intellectual over there” and
that we needed some “good cab-
dniver logic." Therefore, I asked
him if he felt we should re-
place our generals with cab-
drivers. With a frown, ‘he told
me this country didn't need
“your kind of pseudo-intellect.”

I ASKED Governor Rockefel-
ler of New York his senti-
ments, as a candidate, -on the
war. He replied, “Well, if Iwere
a candidate and if I were asked,
as a candidate, to reveal my

position on the war, I, as a can-

 

didate, would have to reply, but
since I am, as of now, not a can-
didate, I -cannot give my views
as one.”

Overhearing my question, Lyn-
don Baines Johnson volunteered

an answer. He said, “My fellow

American, it has been said -that
we have sought to prollonzg the
war. It has been said that we
are not even trying to establish
peace. We, in actuality, do want
peace. And we shall obtain peace,
even if it means killing each and
everyone of our enemies.”

THIS ANSWER did nothing to

' encourage me to continue the

interview, but I pressed on. The
next question I presented to the
candidates was how they would
go about dealing with the inter-

nal unrest in the United Srta-tes-

The :first to answer was ex-
-Governor George Wallace. He
told me again that what we
needed was “s-ome good cab-
driver logic.”

Rich-ard Nix-on gave me his
concrete views -on the problem.
He said, “This is a problem
which, of course, requires deep
del-iberatinon, and, I’m sure” af-
ter certain consideration of the
issue, we will be able to pro-
duce many "thoughts on this mat-
ter.”

LYNDON Baines Johnson
chimed in his analysis, -saying,
“My fellow American, it has
been said that we have long
shirked th-i-s problem. It has
been said that we haven't pro-
vided fo-od for our starving
Americans. Let those who ‘say
this come down t-o the ranch for
ribs and we shall talk it over.”

I ‘then posed the question of
inﬂation to the candidates. Ex-
Governor Wallace once -again as-
sured me that the problem could
be solved with “cab-driver log-
ic.” I was -tempted to ask him if
he owned stock in the cab indus-
try, but I used dliscret-ion.

Governor Reagan considered
the question and replied, “Seems
I remember something about in-
ﬂation from my last picture.”

AFTER a short while, the in-
terview was concluded. The
quality -of the answers I re-
ceived now makes it «difficult for
me to decide which candidate is
best qualiﬁed.

Oh, well, there's always Har-
old Stassen.

Answers
Come Easy
For Clark

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Senator Joseph Clark stood
at the podium and accepted
the respectful applause from
those in the _.
Union's ball-
room.

And then with
his arms spread
high above his
head, as in vic-
tory, he silenced
the audience.
He grinned.

Senator Clark
was going to play it cool. He
thought it rather-amusing that
he was introduced as a lecturer.
He really -came to answer ques-
tions.

-This is election year for Penn-
sylvania's Senator Clark and he
must answer questions very
carefully. He can't afford to be
rnisquoted.

His dark bow tie was crooked,
but Senator Clark didn’t notice
it as he danced and dodged his
way through the avalanche of
questions.

HE SAID he would support
President Johnson for renamin-
ati-on.

He said he would lay  rec-
ord on the line‘ against anyone
who ran against him.

He said he was playing it cool.

He didn't answer questions
which opposed his “enlightened
self-interest.”

“I am trying to play it cool. I
never change my stance until
the variables have been reduced
to the a-bsolu-te minimum,” said
the -Senator.

CLARK IS a senator, u=p for
reelection, and he deals in prac-
tical politics. He saw that Sep-
ator Eugene McCarthy made a
substantial bid for the Demo-
crartic Presidential nomination,
after the New Hampshire pri-
mary. ‘

“The anti-war sentiment is a
lot stronger,” said Senator Clark,
who is considered a dove. “The
war is a stalemate. It threatens
unity. It is a demoralizing can-
cer.”

Senator Clark agrees with the
McCarthy -Kennedy views, -but
he must wait until the August
convention. “I will -support who
ever gets V the nomination,” he
said.

“THE PRESIDENT nas -told
me he is doing everything he
can to end the war. As of this
moment, I am .still supporting
him,” Senator Clark said.

In an election year, the surp-
port of «the President is always
sought by senators «and gover-
nors alike. But this year is dif-
ferent.

A new President will be elect-
ed, and tlhesenators are playing
one candidate against the other.

It's a game and Senator Clark
plays -the game well. An 11-year
senator, Clark has worked hard
in Congress. It is his job and
he doesn't want to lose it.

“Student Concern Cited

(Crmtinucrl from page 1)

He pointed out that by
1970 the average age will be
54, giving tremendous re-
sponsibilities to the nation’s
youth.

“Students can reflect on
problems of society because
they are not yet a part of
the rat race,” Moyer went on
to say.

He repeatedly stressed to-

al involvement of an indi-

vidual, citing as an example
the right of protest. “When
a student protests by march-
ing with a picket Sign it is
his right to do so, but he
should realize that the most
effective way to deal with
problems is to do something
to remedy the situation, not just
to protest,” he said.

“When a solution is offered
to .a problem, people are com-
pelled to take notice. This is to-
tal involvement,” Moyer stated.

“Students want to be heard,

ﬁnd they should not be shut off,”

he said. He added that “News
media are missing the boat if
they do not cover college cam-
puses.”

Moyer also pointed out tihat
high school and college "papers

do not contain enough, if any,
controversial issues. However,
he cited the Pitt News as an ex-
ample of a college paper mak-
ing a signiﬁcant start toward
covering controversy on a local
and national level. Moyer stated
that the Pitt News ll|S the best
college newspaper he has ever
seen.

“The time to learn how to
write hard hitting copy and be-
come involved with the issues
of the day is now,” Moyer stress-
ed. “If you don’t learn now, you
won’t have ‘the time later when
you’re ready -to work,” he added.

“Politics on campus are be-
coming more powerful than
ever,” he stated. “Student pow-

“Professors are another news
source,” she said. “Whenever we
want to ﬁnd out what the im-
pact of a news event Will be on

These are men who know their

stated.

After his address, Moyer an-
swered questions from the high
school audience. Most of the
questions dealt with suppression
of controversy by -school offi-
cials. Moyer answered these by

saying, “VVhat’s the use of hav- .
» ing a paper if the students can't

write editorials?”

Moyer concluded by stressing
the need -for good young report-
ers in news media. “A good way
to get training is to work dur-
ing the summers at radio sta-
tions or n-e-wslplaipers. At least
make a strart,” he said.

Adams Points Wrestlers

Towards National Goals
By Roy Jacobs

Sports Editor

Terry Hoover, barechested, was lying flat o.n his back
gasping for air. Bruce Unangst was in the process of _as-
suming the same position. And Dick Shildt was burying
his head under a refreshing stream of water in the nearby
water fountain.

The picture sort of makes you wonder what wrest-
ling’s all about.

Here were three guys beating their brains out to get
in shape for this coming weekend’s national champion-
ships. It is conceivable, though not likely, that they won't
even get past the first round. Why, then, go through all
this physical punishment?

The answer lies largely with one man, varsity coach
Dave Adams. Last year, sports editor Tom Sacks said the
wrestling program lacked recruiting, coaches, and tradi-
tion. With the hiring of Adams, Pitt wrestling acquired
the first two and is well on the way to the third.

This year, Adam’s squad won more dual meets than
the last two seasons combined. Its fifth place finish in
the Eastern championships marked a remarkable turn-
around from last year's 15th place finish. Several fresh-
men posted outstanding individual records. Yet, Adams
is not completely satisfied.

“I wouldn’t say we were satisfied,” commented the
coach. “We could have Won some other meets. In fact, if
we were satisfied, I’d guess we didn’t set our goals high
enough. -

“We received" a lot of satisfaction because we did our
best in the Easterns,” Adams continued. “But I had ‘hoped
that every man would have been pointing towards the na-
tional title. Too many people seem to think the season is
over when the Easterns are over.”

This is the way Adams thinks. It’s also the way his
assistant Bob Fehrs thinks. And its the way he wants
his team to think. In the right frame of mind, a team can
do won.ders, as evidenced by the grapplers’ upset of Le-
high earlier this season.

“Many times the differences between winning and los-
ing is an awfully fine line,” views Adams.

“We’ve tried to impart a winning attitude,” he adds.
“Either they have the talent or they don’t, really. It’s just
bringing out the right aspect in each month that will help
the team.”

Adams knows what a winning attitude is. He is a
former Eastern champion and a national runner-up. He
was responsible for recruiting most of Navy’s Eastern
champion and fourth-ranked nationally team.

. And, it’s now his job to help Pitt regain its national
reputation as a wrestling powerhouse. Many people are
expecting him to win the East next season. Adams wel-
comes the compliments, but he isn’t promising any mir-
acles.

“I don’t think we have the depth to feel we’re near
national status,” he said... “A good group this year, a.nd
one the next year, and we’ll be to the stage where we’ll
let people know we’re around.”

.Dave Adams has already served the East notice that
he’s around. He’s breathed new life into. a dying wrestling
program. His freshmen clean up at any tournament they
enter. As a result, it is no longer a question of will Pitt
regain national status, butcrather, how soon.

RIDL RETURNS

Buzz Ridl, newly announced
varsity basketball coach, made
his ﬁrst local appearance since
his appointment when he met
the press at a luncheon today
at Gustine’s. Details will be in
Wednesday’s paper.

Ridl’s ﬁnal Westminster
team ﬁnished the season with
a. 20-8 record and a fourth
place ﬁnish in the 32-team
NAIA basketball tournament,
losing in the semi-ﬁnals to
eventual champion Central
State of Ohio.

 

Hoopsters View Ridl’s Selection,

F oresee Improved Cage Future

by ART ROSENGARTEN
Today is an important day for 15 var-
sity athletes. This afternoon at 4 p.m., the
varsity hoopsters will meet their enew'men-
tor, Charles “Buzz” Ridl, for the first time.

The basketball players feel that Ridl will be the
answer to Pitt's basketball woes and be able to
lead them to a winning season for the first time in
a long time.

“I“m personally happy with the decision made
by Frank Carver and the athletic committee in
their choice of Ridl,” said sophomore forward Bob
McFarland. This same opinion was voiced by
Charles Hunt, Steve Stevenson, and Len Kalata.

“From what I've seen of him he appears to be
a real good coach,” said Kalata. “And what is
more important, he seems to get the most out of
his players. That's about 80% of the coaching
game.”

All of the players feel that they have the ma-
terial for a winning ball team, but it needs to be
molded into a cohesive unit.

“We lust need somebody to put us together and

     

a winning coach at Westminster.

 

make us jell,” added center Hunt. “I feel that '

Ridl is the one who can do it.”

“This year’s squad appeared to the observer
as one that lacked a good deal of discipline and
desire. The players feel that Ridl is the type of
disciplinarian that they need for success.

‘ “He looks like he can obtain the desire and
determination from his players that is needed to
win,” said defensive specialist Stevenson. Kalata
added that, “We’re the type of team that must be
disciplined in order to win and it looks like Ridl
is just that type of strong disciplinarian.”

From his Westminster teams, Ridl has gotten
the reputation of playing with a patterned offense.

“We need a patterned organized offense in or-
der to win, because we lack that one big star,”
ventured McFarland. “It’s the type of ball that
Bob Petrini and I like to play. and we should have
no trouble in adjusting to it.”

It is hoped by the cagers, as well as by every-
one else concerned with basketball, that Ridl can
bring the same type of success here that made him

Those freshmen wrestlers

just keep racking up the
honors. This past weekend
three frosh matrnen entered the
Stevens Trade Tournament, and
all three of them came back with
individual titles.
I Mark Payne not only won the
145 pound class. but he also cop-
ped his second Outstanding Wrest-
ler Award in as many post-season
tournaments. Bob Kuhn (160)
and Ralph Cindrich (heavy-
weight) also won titles in their
divisions.

Overall, the grapplers" per-
formance earned them second:
place in the tourney, which isn’t
bad -considering the first place
team, Stevens Trade School, was
the host team and fielded a full
squad.

The Stevens’ tournament is an
open meet, which means the com-
petition ranged from high school
J.V.’s to college graduate. As a
result there was some question-
as to the calibre of the competi-
tion.

“The coach (Bob Fehrs) said
he would ‘be embarassed if we
lost,” reviewed champion Kuhn.
“But I thought’ it was one of the
toughest we’ve been in all year.

“I’m very happy,” he contin-
ued. “It’s the first trophy I’ve
ever won.”

Kulm, who finished his season
12-0, also -won titles at the Navy
Plebe tournament and the Michi-
gan Freshman Invitational. Payne,
at 14-0, also won: two other titles
while Cindrich, 13-1, had a, first
at Michigan. and a second at
Navy.

All three followed the same
pattern in winning their crowns.

MARK PAYNE
Named Outstanding Wrestler

After a couple close early round
bouts, they breezed by in the fin-
als.

Payne, for example, won his
first match by only one point. Of
course, he was wrestling a two-
time junior college national cham-

pion. Kuhn only won his fi13s3'c‘

match 3-1 while Cindrich had to
come from behind to pin his sec-
ond round opponent. ‘

The probable reason for the
slow start was that the frosh only
had two days of hard practice
since the Plebe tournament two
weeks ago.

At any rate, Payne pinned his
opponent in the finals after
breaking the arm of his third
round rival in less than 30 sec-
onds. Kuhn’s final victory was
an 11-5 decision, and Cindrich
couldn’t quite pin John Klin.ger-
man of Ward Hall, winning 17-1.

Varsity coach Dave Adams
probably can’t wait to get these?
fellows next year.

Although this year’s tennis team promises to exempli-
fy the upward trend of‘ tennis at the University, the
heights it reaches may be impaired by football practice.

Two years ago the tennismen
suffered set back after set back
as they won only three of 14
matches. Last year, a more tal-
ented squad ﬁnished with a re-
spectable 7-5-1 record. And ten-
nis coach Ben Pope things this
season could be even better.

“We have at least as good a

better,” commented Pope, who
has good reason to feel optimis-
tic with his top two players back
from last year’s team.

The question is how much
better the tennismen can do.
Pope has a number of talented
“ifs" to ,i11g§;le around a proven

One big “if” is J. D. Lewis,

ter ﬁnals, which means that the
North Carolina recruit will not
be able to practice tennis as
much as the sport requires for
perfection. .

“J. D. has the ability to be
number one or two man on the
team,” explained P-ope, “but you
can’t play well without practice,
regardless of how good you
are.”

Pope expects Lewis to be good
enough to help the tennis team
despite restricted practice. How-
ever, Lewis might no-t be as
good as he could.

By practicing with the varsity
gridders, Lewis also faces the
possibility of injury.

But Pope has other talented
“ifs” to be optimistic about.
With last year’s nu-mber three
man, Bill Goldstein, only avail-
a.ble for the first two -contests
before he returns home ﬁor the
summer, John G. Kings becomes
the expected heir to -the vacan.t

post.
Pope seems to have a lot of
conﬁdence in» King’s ability.

However, King is unproven thus
far.

Another “if” is Rich Abrams,
a senior from Newport, R. I.

“Abram-s defeated Kirk Hunt-
ter of Bethan, who had Won 37
times in a row, and he also beat
John Kile from Youngstown,
who had won 16 in a now,”
bamed Pope, “So he could be a
pleasant surprise.”

The tenn-ismen travel to West
Virginia April 1 for their ﬁrst
game of the new campaign. Un-
til -then, Pope will be watching
his “ifs” practice on the Univer-
.sity’s new courts behind Trees
Hall.

MONEY: THE STORY OF AN ENGINEER

We all know, of course, that in this age of technology '

every engineering senior is receiving fabulous offers of
employment, but do we realize just how fabulous these
offers are? Do we comprehend just how keenly industry
is competing? To illustrate, let me cite the true and typi-
cal case of E. Pluribus Ewbank, a true and typical senior.

One day last week while strolling across the MIT
campus, E. Pluribus was hailed by a portly and prosper-
ous man who sat in a yellow convertible studded with
precious gem stones. “Hello,” said the portly and pros-
perous man, “I am Portly Prosperous, president of
American Xerographic Data Processing and Birth Con-
trol, Incorporated. Are you a senior?”

“Yes, sir,” said E. Pluribus.

“Do you like this car?” said Portly.

“Yes, sir,” said E. Pluribus.

“It’s yours,” said Portly.

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Do you like Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades?”
said Portly.

“What clean living, clean shaven American does not?"
said E. Pluribus. *

“Here is a pack,” said Portly. “And a new pack will
be delivered to you every twelve minutes as long as you

1ve.”

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Would your wife like a mink coat?” said Portly.

“I feel sure she would,” said E. Pluribus, “but I am
not married.” _

“Do you want to be?” said Portly. —

“What clean living, clean shaven American does not?”
said E. Pluribus.

Portly pressed‘ a button on the dashboard of the con-
vertlble and the trunk opened up and out came a nubile
maiden with golden hair, rosy knees, a perfect disposi-
tlon, and the appendix already removed. “This is Svet-
lana O"Foo1e,” said Portly. “Would you like to marry her?”

“Is her appendix out?” said E. Pluribus.

“Yes,” said Portly.

“Okay, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Congratulations,” said Portly. “And for the happy
bride, a set of 300 monogrammed prawn forks.”

“Thanks, hey,” said Svetlana.

“Now then,” said Portly to E. Pluribus, “let us get
down to business. My company will start you at $75,000
a year. You will retire at full salary upon reaching the
age of 26. _We will give you an eleven-story house made of
lapis lazuli, each room to be stocked with edible furniture.
Your children w1ll receive a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as they
shall live. We will keep your teeth in good repair and also
the teeth of your wife and children unto the third genera-
tion. We will send your dentist a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as
he shall live, and thereafter to his heirs and assigns...
Now, son, I want you to think carefully about this offer.
Meanwhile here is 50 thousand dollars in small, un-
marked bills which places you under no obligation what-
soever.”

“Well, it certainly seems like a fair offer,” said E.
Pluribus. “But there is something you should know. I am
not an engineer. In fact I don’t go to M.I.T at all. I just
walked over here to admire the trees. I am at Harvard
majoring in Joyce Ki1mer.” '

“Oh,” said Portly.

“I_ guess I don’t get to keep the money and the con-
\I7)elrt1_bble and the Personnas and the broad, do I?” said E.

ur1 us.

“Of course you do,” said Portly. “And if you'd like the I

job, my offer still stands.”

Speaking of wealth, if you want a truly rich, truly
luxurious shave, try Personna Blades, regular or injec-
tor, with Burma-Shave, regular or menthol. Thero’s a
