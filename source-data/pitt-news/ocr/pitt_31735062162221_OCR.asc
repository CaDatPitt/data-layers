Pitt Withdraws Arsenal Support

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

An onslaught of citizen protest is
building in the Lawrenceville
district to resist the University’s
determination to close the com-
munity’s Arsenal Family and
Children's Center‘ rather than
absorb its operating ‘deficit for
1974. . '
The controversy has arisen over
the University's announcement
earlier this year that it would not

subsidize the facility’s debts, which.
, total roughly $40,000, thus circling

June 30 as the shutdown target
date. The Arsenal site will be
forced to terminate its 21-year

program of preschool and after-
school services, which were orig-

- inally designed under the auspices

of Dr. Benjamin Spockand other
child-care leaders.

The University is permitting
Arsenal to. close its doors as part of
a plan to “consolidate and
the various child
development programs under Pitt’s
wing, according to Chancellor
Wesley Posvar. Once they are
consolidated, the Chancellor hopes
to establish the combined nucleus
of services somewhere on the
Oakland campus.

Patricia Dean, chairwoman of the
center’s Mothers’ Club, is co-or-
dinating an inter-community effort
to marshal opposition against the
University's decision to let Arsenal
fold. Dean believes the facility has
long been an illustration of
University-community co-operation
and places a high value on the
interdependent relationship that
exists between the two institutions.

“We feel the Glaser report

' outlined quite clearly the services

which Arsenal provided the Uni-

versity," she said. “It's the
University's responsibility as a
social institution to see that a

facility like Arsenal is permitted to
continue in its work.”

The Glaser report contained the
findings of a committee appointed
by Posvar" to examine early

Energy Sifuafion Easing; A
More Oil Available Soon

BY MATTHEW KAMBIC

As President Nixon announced a
brighter future in the nation’s
energy situation-, Pennsylvania’s
politicians looked to Washington
for immediate help for the state's
gasoline difﬁculties.

Nixon, in an appearance Tuesday
night before the National Associa-

1 tion of Broadcasters, said because

of the end of the oil embargo “it
will not be necessary for us to have
compulsory rationing in the United
States.” i

Along with rescinding the order
which closed gasoline stations on
Sundays, Nixon said oil allocations
to industry and agriculture would
be increased, and additional
gasoline allocations would be made
available to eliminate waiting lines
at service stations.

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania Gover-
nor Milton Shapp turned to the
courts in his struggle to end what
he called “a gross disparity" in the
allocation system. On Wednesday
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania ﬁled suit in federal court

 

against the federal government and
30 oil companies over its March
gasoline allocation. The suit
charges the Federal Energy Office
has short changed Pennsylvania,
and asks for additional allocation.

Shapp met yesterday with Federal

Robert Glaser of the University's

Learning, Research and Develop-

ment Center, submitted recom-

mendations that supported the

pro-

gram through every available

means.

‘‘It has maintained extensive,
detailed records of long-term
family histories which are _poten-
tially useful for research and
training." the report stated, in
reference to the facility. “The
primary strength of the AFCC is its
use as a resource for training
involving observation of whole.
families as well as of the children
who attend its preschool. and
afterschool program. These
programs appear to be valued by
the community. 7

“The sense of the committee,
with respect to the Arsenal Center,
is that it became part of a proposed
new University entity with educa-
tion, service, and research in
human development,” the report
“Until this new entity

that AFCC be continued as a
separate center which can provide
immediate resources for the newt
organization.”_ I .
However, the Chancellor does
not view the disclosure as a
mitigating factor.
l“The Glaser report may be
accurate in its evaluation of
Arsenal. but it never told us how to
fund it," Posvar countered. ‘‘If we
are to spend money in bringing
everything together, there is no
way we can accomplish this and
finance Arsenal at the same time.
We can only improve these
programs by centralizing them
here on campus, as long as we
aren’t asked to subsidize Arsenal’s
expenses at the same time."
Dr. Sara H. Arnaud, Arsenal’s
director, criticized the University's
actions. “The Administration

Inadequate preparation charged

Pass-Fail Option Due in

BY LARRY PANSINO

Law School deans granted
students enrolled in an income tax
course the right to take the course
pass-fail because of student char-
ges of inadequate preparation by
the instructor, John Chote.

Chote was hired a week to ten
days before the beginning of the
current term, according to John E.
Murray. the law school's associate
dean for faculty. Murray said
typically law school professors are
hired at least six months before

they must teach a course for the
first time.

Students in the course became
concerned about the quality of
instruction and the possible grade
result_s and met with Dean W.
Edward Sell. Associate Dean
Tomas 0. White, and Murray

yesterday to present their demands
for the pass-fail grading option.
Murray said such an option for 1:

school."

Wepner Review SeHled-i

BY DEBBIE POPP

A ninety day probational period
is the decision reached by Dean of
the Graduate School of Social Work
David -Epperson: in the academic
review of Franklyn Wepner.

Epperson made his decision after
a nine day study of tapes of the
Academic Review Committee’s
(ARC) proceedings and a written
rationale for dismissal. ‘

The ARC questioned Wepner’s
student status and potential as a
professional social worker on the
basis of his classroom conduct, and
his leadership in drama therapy

-In a procedural move, Epperson
reconvened the ARC to counter-
mand its decision. It was rumored
the ARC had» recommended to
remove Wepner from the school.

“The ARC worked very well and
arduously. . I respect
decision," Epperson said. “I
believe the ARC acted appropri-
ately on the information which they
had about the case.

“In comparison, I ‘had more
information at my disposal in a-
matter of writing and interpreta-
tion. It was a difficult decision...

any lasting means."
Posvar contended the facility

knew “full well" ‘what the
consequences would be if it failed
in this “obligation.” The

University, under the direction of
Dr. J. Steele Gow, enlisted the aid
of six foundations to supply the
center with the temporary revenue
it needed during the interval
period. However, according to

Dean, there is considerable mis-2

understanding as to where perma-
nent funds were to'be secured.

“The Chancellor must be misin-
formed," she maintained. “I don't
recall any stipulations saying we
needed state or federal funds.
According to the ‘original 1971
agreement. we were to try and ﬁnd
ﬁnancing-wherever possible and
we did. The center did manage to
perform consulting work for other
daycare centers that brought in, I
believe, $137,000. But this wasn’t
a lasting means of support.

“We worked under the assump-
tion that the money was to come
from private sources, not public
coffers, and we did everything in
our power to find such support,”
she added. “Unfortunately, it just
wasn’t there. We have met all
those requirements of the initial
agreement, and we feel the
University has an obligation to
keep us from closing for good.”

without a struggle. Forty
residents, students, faculty, and
staff members attended a meeting
Wednesday night to organize the
tasks involved in mobilizing com-
munity as well as governmental
endorsement. Within the next few
weeks, Governor Shapp, Mayor
Flaherty, City Council, the County
Commissioners, and state and
congressional representatives are
going to be contacted by the
committee and informed of the
center's plight. The news media
reportedly will likewise be famil-
iarized with Arsenal's‘ circum-
stances.

In addition, a long« list of
professional and civic organizations
has agreed to submit letters to the
Chancellor and the Board of
Trustees, urging them to recon-
sider their decision. Lawrenceville
merchants will also be encouraged
to join in the ﬁght to preserve the
Arsenal facility, according to Dean.

Several Pitt students assured the
committee that the student body
would work through its campus
government to pressure the Ad-
ministration into reversing its
position.

One member of the committee
noted the University's enlarged
ﬁscal appropriations for the coming
year and commented, “If the
Administration contributed one
dollar out of every hundred it
receives from the $4 million
increase alone, it could fund the
Center easily."

Pitt’s total 1974 appropriation

from Governor Shapp is $51
million.

The Chancellor reacted unfav-
orably to such a suggestion,
however.

“There's not enough money
there to do any such thing. We'll
have a hard enough time as it is
meeting basic salary increases
alone," he said. “There’s very
little money for the funding of new
programs." .

The Lawrenceville community
will present a problem for the
University if the program is
terminated. according to the
feelings expressed by one local
resident, Eileen Ambrose.

“It will be a tremendous loss to
the community," she said. “The
people at Arsenal have devoted
their life to this program and I can
never forget the tremendous help
they gave my son during his early
years. Their early influence laid a
strong foundation for him when he
proceeded onto public school.

“Once the public is totally aware
of what’s going on out here, you're
going tosee a lot of protest. Many
of our children attended this center

.near my home.

and believe me, they gave to us.
They're not going to sit by and
watch another community service
abandonedf'

Perry Hartge, another resident,
has two children enrolled in,the
Arsenal project and voiced a
similar opinion. “I'd like to see us
petition the University and the
people who support the University
to see if something can’t be done to
keep it open. My children would
really miss the place‘ and I

‘personally believe the program is

excellent.

“The center has given my child a
basic understanding of life and how
to deal with other people."

Chiou Mei Tsai has entered her
four-year old daughter in the
program and stated: “I want the
Arsenal facility to remain open and
That is all. The
teachers here show kindness to my
child and she enjoys coming here."

Dear Editor:

We would like to address
ourselves to the Student Govern-
ment's refusal to divulge the fee it
intends to pay to Robert Welch,
Chairperson of the John Birch
Society, who spoke recently at the
University.

.We feel that the Student
Government Board is required to
release information concerning the
amount of money being paid to this
speaker. The Student Government
aruged, in a recent letter to the Pitt

News, that the contract they signed

with the -John Birch Society
stipulated that these figures not be
released to the public and. if they
were given out,,the speaker would
not be able to fulfill his speaking
engagement. It is our opinion that
the Student Government Board is
not authorized to make contract
agreements which prohibit the
release of information concerning
the payment of speakers’ fees.

The money being used to bring
Robert Welch to this campus is
coming directl_y from the students
in the form of their $12.00 activity
fee. which is not optional. The
actions of the Board concerning
this issue are in violation of the
students‘ right to know where their
money is being spent.

All other student groups are
required to “open their books"
when asked about monies being
spent to bring speakers to this
campus. Why is Student Govern-
ment exempt from this rule?"

Dear Editor: .

l have just finished reading G.W.
stevens' editorial “A Bad Choice"
in regard to Pitt's impoverished
wrestling program. It just so
happens that I'm one of those
wrestling fans who'll “just have to
be patient." as Mr. Stevens so
quaintly puts it. Patient for what??
Coach Adams has been at the helm
of the Pitt wrestling team since
1967 and in that time the team's
record has gotten progressively
worse.

The Pitt News inaccurately
stated in an article Wednesday
March 13. 1974 entitled “BAS,

African Intercultural Night would
be given to the Biafran Relief
Fund. The donations were given to
the organization Relief for Africans
in Need in the Sohel.

Whereas at one time (not

BY DENNY MCMANUS

Monday night I listened to an
oration about “a monster of power,
determined to enslave us all." The
speech concerned a “threat to our
nation." The speaker was Robert
Welch, founder and director of the
ultra-conservative John Birch Soci-
ety. A

While the large majority of my
colleagues heckled and apparently
chose to dismiss the old gentleman
as a paranoid, perhaps a senile
individual with some badly out-
dated ideas. llistened closely to his
talk. In the course of the speech, l
became thoroughly convinced that
what this man was saying. was in
fact. the truth. The truth of his
statement, however. can only be
seen,by reading between the lines.

His speech was originally pre-
sented in 1958. At that time the
subject of his ' talk was “the
Communist threat" and the “can-
cer of collectivism." Now, his
subject ‘ easily could have been
something entirely different. but
with several important similar
characteristics.

Welch began his speech by

declaring, “We have in our midst,_

dozens of slimy characters who
have used every possible means to
advance themselves with no

to the

Eastern wrestling power, we are
now a doormat for such schools as
Penn State. Lehigh, Clarion and
Navy. True. this year's wrestling
schedule was one of the toughest
around. but taking on, schools like
Michigan, Oklahoma and Oregon
State is beyond any eastern team,
not just Pitt. Very seldom (with
Clarion an exception this year) has
any Eastern school been able to
stay close with these. powerhouses.
My question is this--why can't we
remain at the level we once were
with Penn State and Navy? What is
it that these programs have, that
Pitt doesn't? It certainly isn't the
caliber of wrestler. Pitt has been
able to snare its share of
outstanding school boys these past
few years. Someone might ask if
we have the talent. where is it?
That's a good question which leads
to another interesting point. Why
is it that at Pitt many outstanding
high school wrestlers like the
Payne brothers. Bimbo Chatman or
Kevin Love never seem to finish
their four years out? Surely that
can't be explained away because of
a depleted budget.

Finally, I'd like to say. that
although Coach Adams is. without
a doubt. a very knowledgeable man
about wrestling. so were Dave
Hart and Carl DePasqua about

reference to morality. They have
used supreme cunning and ruth-
lessness to achieve positions of
importance."

In recent weeks, we have all
been witnesses to a demonstration
of the truth of his statement. H.R.
Haldeman, John Ehrlichman,
Charles Colson and four other top
aides within the Nixon Administra-
tion have been indicted for
conspiring in the burglary of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.
Former Attorney General John
Mitchell and former Secretary of
Commerce, Maurice Stans are
currently on trial for conspiracy,
obstructing justice and lying to a
grand jury. More indictments for
various “dirty tricks" are sure to
be forthcoming.

The Bircher continued describ-
ing their method of operation. He
noted, “They have used long and
careful and insidious preparation in
taking over this country. They
have spent millions on propaganda
and have had decades of exper-
ience."

The campaign to “Re-elect the
President" is still very much in the
news. Revelations of “dirty
tricks," break-ins and illegal
campaign contributions to the most

highly financed campaign in_

football, and look where it got
them. In other words, something is
desperately lacking in the way the
Pitt wrestling program is being
run. and I hope A D Myslinski willl
try to fill that deficiency in the very
near future. ' "

o

Patience, Mr. Stevens? Pitt
wrestling fans ran out of that a long
time ago.

history are now topics of congres-
sional inquiry. Many political
,observers were prompted to recall
the events of past campaigns; the
smear letters in California and the
“Checkers Affair” for example.

Robert Welch lamented, “the
rise of these immoral men has
weakened and endangered us, It
has caused a loss of faith in our
government." The Watergate, lTT
and wheat scandals as well as the
resignation of a vice-president have
served to make Americans less
trusting of their governmental
institutions than ever before."

There is hope, however, the
Birch Society founder said.
“Learning the truth is the only way
to stop it. We must not only know
the truth but also see the truth if it
is to set us free."

Many are currently working so
that we may see the truth. Judge
John J. Sirica ordered this week
that a sealed grand jury report on
President Nixon's handling of'the
Watergate issue be turned over to
the House Judiciary Committee.

The committee is still attempting to *

gain access to 42 Presidential
tapes. The Senate committee
continues questioning certain key

figures in the last election.
Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the
House Waysfand Means Commit-
tee has predicted that Nixon will
resign when a special. congres-
sional panel files its report next
week. That report claims that the
President owes as much as
$350,000. in federal income taxes.
' More and more congressmen are

‘viewing impeachment ' as a = viable
way to set us free from a corrupt

administration.

Welch was talking about “the
Communists" but the statements
as has been demon-
strated, could easily apply to the
Nixon Administration.

Could it be that our staunchly
anti-communist leader (remember

3 Alger Hiss) has not been entirely

honest about his political goals and

party affiliation? Could it be that '

Nixon was actually on one of Joe
McCarthy's lists? (He certainly
has demonstrated an affinity for
Could it be that he and
Khrushchev were actually discus-
sing communist strategy in the
“kitchen?" Why was Mr. Welch
afraid to come right out and say
that our president is the leader of
the “international communist con-
spiracy?"

Even if Nixon isn't the leader of
the communists, he certainly fits
Welch's description of a “threat"
and “cancerous growth." The
Bircher ended his talk by asking,
“Are we going to let our whole
country go under?" He feels the
communists are the enemy that are
damaging our nation. I disagree.
The enemy is clearly someone else.

This is your key to npdented calculating
capacity. Only Hewlett- Packard offers it.

It lets you “speak" to your calculator with total consistency, because
it lets you load data into a 4-Register Stack. This means: (1) you always
enter and process your data the same way, no matter what your problem;
(2) you don't have to re-enter data; (3) you can see a// intermediate data
anytime.

Our HP-45 is one of two pre-programmed scientific pocket-sized
computer calculators with this key. That's one reason it’s the most pow-
erful pre-programmed pocketsized scientific computer calculator. Here
are three of many others: » .

1. It's pre—programmed to handle 44 arithmetic, trigonometric and
logarithmic functions and data manipulation operations beyond the

2. It lets you store nine constants in its nine Addressable Memory
Registers, and it gives you a “Last X" Register for error correction or
multiple operations on the same number. '

3. It displays up to 10 significant digits in either fixed-decimal or
scientific notation and automatically positions the decimal point through
out its 200-decade range. .

Our HP-35 is the other. It handles 22 functions, has one Addressable

Even with the recent ﬁnancial success enjoyed by the Athletic
Department viaithe football and basketball teams, there will be one
‘group of athletes on campus which will actually suffer from this inﬂux
of revenue‘. .

I call them athletes, although they do not participate in a varsity
sport. They are the Pitt Hockey Club, or more appropriately, they
WERE the Pitt Hockey Club.

Earlier this week the Hockey Club was denied funds for next year by
the Studnet Government Allocations Committee. Allocations must now
send that recommendation to the Student Government Board for final
approval and the verdict appears quite clear. ,

It seems that both Student Government Allocations and the Board
thinks the time is right for the Athletic Department to take the skaters
under its wing, thus making hockey a varsity sport at Pitt. Funds for
the Club were refused on the grounds that the subsidation of the Club
by the Student Activities Fee would actually be a deterrent to the
progress’ of the sport in regards to popularity on campus. -

iAllocations and Student Government tried the same strategy last

summer, even when Athletic Director Cas.Myslinski had "turned all‘

efforts into rebuilding his department through -a rennovation of the
football program. Now with the success of Johnny Majors & Co..
Student Government would like to get a ﬁnger in the pie and take a bit
of a load off its shoulders, which it really can't be blamed for.

But one blatant fact that Allocations has overlooked is thatithe pie
isn’t done yet. There is no way after a single year that the Athletic
Department can even dream to add hockey to its varsity sports list.
Myslinskiwishes he could do it and I believe him.

In order for hockey to go varsity, the University must own. (or have
immediate and preferential access). to an indoor ice skating rink. And

. right now, the only rink existing in Oakland or the city limits is a mere
conglomeration of lines on a set of blueprints that are the designs for
the rennovation of Fitzgerald Fieldhouse or even the construction of a
new arena. Those prints sit idly in Myslinski‘s ofﬁce. waiting for the
cash to roll in from the money-making varsity sports.

For the Athletic Department to now take over the ﬁnances of the
hockey program would mean the further neglect of presently exisitng
varsity sports such as wrestling, track, baseball. soccer. men's
swimming. the entire women's program and...the list goes on. These
are all areas where the Athletic Department has already made financial
commitments and owes some overdue attention.

For the past season, Student Government graciously conceded that
its efforts _at twisting the University’s arm were without due
justification and allocated the skaters slightly over $2300. For the nine

games at the Civic Arena the Club had to pay around $2200. In order to ’

come up with the funds to pay for two practice sessions per week, each
Club member had to dish out up to $35 over the course of the year if he
wanted to remain in good s_tatus.~ .

' I

-.y-/_ “.

   

Yet C-MU could manage but one
goal with the man advantage as Pitt
goalie Jumpin’ ‘John DeFazio
played brilliantly, turning away 35
of 38 Tartan shots. DeFazio held
Mellon off the scoreboard until the
2:00 mark of the final period while
his teammates built an insur-
mountable 4-0 lead.

Once again it was the magic
touch of freshman winger Rick
Vernon powering the Pitt attack.
Vernon had the hat trick, beating
C-MU goaltender Jeff Hart on
three breakaways. ,

Gary Cummings and Charly
Hagins. who spent as much time in
the penalty box as he did on the ice,
also scored a goal apiece for the
Panthers. Hagins was sent to the
box on eight different occasions,
once for “interference on the
faceoff," a penalty that hasn't been
called under N.H.L. rules in the
last few years. ’ '

Vernon initiated the Pitt scoring
with his first breakaway goal at
8:47 of the first period. The
ageless blue line veteran Kerry

Browne, playing in what could be .

his last performance in a Pitt
uniform, sprung Vernon loose at
center ice with a pass that split the
‘defense. Vernon cruised in alone
on Hart, deked him to the ice with
veritable ease, and ﬂipped the puck
over his right‘ shoulder for the goal.

Vernon repeated the solo skate,
this time taking a pass at center ice
from team captain Denny Browne.
Once again Hart flopped to the ice
and Vernon slammed the rubber
home. ’
Cummings took his turn at
beating Hart early in the second
period'after taking a pass’ from
winger and linemate Bob Arturo
and circling around the C-MU net.
Cummings turned the left post
sharply, jammed the puck at Hart's
skates and then watched it roll over
the red line. -
C-MU came up with the power
play no less than four times in that
period but it was Pitt, in the person
of Charly Hagins, that did the
scoring. Hagins and Denny
Browne crossed the Mellon blue
line two on two, Hagins sending
Browne in with the puck on the
extreme left wing to draw the

The Pitt Hockey Club is indeed an athletic organization (membership

of just under 50) but it also serves the students with a source of
\entertainment. Actually, hockey outdrew most of the varsity sports,
(with the exception of football and basketball.) Remember now that

students attending Pitt hockeyicontestshad to purchase a ticket and '

provide their own transportation. Last year the Club was able to
provide buses to take interested students to the games but had to
discontinue that policy this year because of the cutback in allocations.

Besides drawing a.fair amount of student interest this season.
hockey also attracted a large number of people from the surrounding
communities. Pittsburgh is just beginning to develop into a town that
appreciates the sport and in cities with expanded programs, hockey has
a great potential to make money. ' J .

The St. Louis University team which is an independent varsity squad

A NOT competing in either NCAA or ECAC Divisions, recently drew

15,000 fans for a game against Ohio State, a school which just turned
its hockey program varsity. ’

The Hockey Club supposedly is not alone in the futile battle for
money. According to Lori Seman. Student Government Allocations
Advisor, “no athletic clubs would receive funds for next year."

According to Phil Rosenthal, former member of the Allocations
Committee who just recently resigned, “the Pitt Rifle, Fencing and
Karate Clubs-all received approvals on their respective budgets from
the Allocations Committee and will be reviewed by Student

I Government Board in the beginning of April.” Rosenthal was liaison

for the Rifle Club.

Last year, when the Hockey Club received just $2300 out of a $6000
allocation, the Riﬁe Club was handed over $3200 out of a $3900
request. And for next year. the Riﬂe Club's request includes
ammunition, shooting jackets, slings and scopes to send ten
representatives to away competiton.

For next year, the Fencing Club's request for money to purchase an
electronic scorer, which isn't necessary, was approved.

It was once explained to me the student organizations which served
or involved the greatest percentage of students would receive the
greater part of the Allocations Committee interests. It is quite
apparent now that funding clubs depends on their particular use of
existing University facilities. '

There's a rifle range somewhere below the ground level at Trees
Hall. I've been at this University for three-years and I never knew that
until yesterday. I doubt if I'll ever get to see it.

So the Pitt Hockey Club. victims of circumstances in a political
disagreement between Student Government and the University, played
its last game at the Civic Arena last night and won the WPIHA
championship for the third straight time in the three year history of the
local league. Unless funds can be found somewhere for next season,
the league champs will be absent from the scene and the WPIHA will
lose its largest drawing card. Hockey will have to wait until that rink is
built. perhaps 1978. i _

“I don‘t think last year was that
good of a season.” Majors stated

T’ firmlv. ‘‘I’m not satisﬁed with a

f_‘i.6-4-ldseason. Right now we have a

‘lot of work to do and some very big
holes to fill."

Majors was obvioi1sly' referring to
the loss of seven starters from last

~ year's squad. The biggest holes to

fill will be on the offensive line
where two tackles. a guard. and an
end will have to be l'C.pl£tL‘(:(l., The

"Our t)l'l.L‘1t'sl\'L‘ problems won't
come so much from the backfield

where we have four returning
starters.” Majors commented.
"but we are a little short of

linemen. We were able to come up
with some good recruits in this
area. Joe Ave/3/.ano is our offensive
line coach so it will be his job to get
the line in shape."

Fortunately, the defensive line
will not pose as big a -problem in
the upcoming season. Tackle

‘ all-star

Glenn Hyde and end Jim Buckmon
will not be back to repeat their
performances, although
coach Jim Dyer should be able to
establish a tough front. Just who
will replace linebacker Rod Kirby is
the big defensive question at this
time.

“We're looking for some help at
linebacker." said the Pitt mentor.
"Ron Kirby will be awfully hard to
replace. Right now I don't know
where the help will come from."

Coach Majors listed three other.

areas the team will concentrate on
this spring. They are the passing

game. the kicking game return
area, and defensive secondary
confidence. He is concerned with

establishing team depth.

“Conditioning and good fortune
played a big part in staying away
[from costly injuries last season,”
he noted. “However, we need to
establish depth in all areas of our
team this spring.”

Ma_jors declined to comment on
any players who have not yet been
tested in season play but special
interest will be centered on some
junior college transfers who,
hopefully, can lend some imme-
diate help. The new recruits are
tackle Pat Gleich (6-3. 263). tackle
Louis Vocatura (6-4, 245), tackle
Dave Treiber (6-3, 235),_ fullback

Pitt's first practice session was
held yesterday and future work-
outs will be held four days a week
with an additional full-team scrim-
mage every Saturday. The squad
will have Mondays and Sundays off
and all seniors will be permitted to
miss the first three drill sessions.
This will give the coaching staff an
opportunity to take a close look at
some of the. younger squad
members.

Most of the hard hitting will come
on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and
Saturdays. Majors cited the
important things he will look for in
his team members.

“We're looking for those people
who will block. tackle. and run with
the football," said Majors. "We'll
also be doing a lot of hitting. Most
importantly. I'm looking for leader-
ship to come to the front. We lost
several ofour team leaders through
graduation and leadership is an
important part of any winning
team."

The Panthers will have 36 days to
hold 20 practice sessions, accor-
ding to NCAA rules. Spring drills
will come to a close with the annual
Blue-Gold game April 27 in Pitt
Stadium.

schools that defeated Pitt high-
lighted the 2nd annual Pitt News

desperation 30-foot jump shot
snapped Pitt's 22-game winning
streak.

Besides Brown. the team consis-
ted of: Brian Winters.

State; Levi Phillips. West Virginia;
and Dan Gerard. Virginia._,

The team was selected by the
Pitt players and coaches based on
the players‘ performance against
Pitt this past season.

Brown pumped in 32 points to
lead the Nittany Lions to a 66-64
upset of the Panthers at University
Park. The 6-4junior shot 70% from
the floor that game, and had nine
assists. His 32 points were the
most anyone scored against Pitt all
season. _ -

In Pitt's 83-61 victory over Penn
State at the Field House earlier in
the season. Brown was held to six
points. I

The 7-4 Burleson came on strong
after David Thompson's injury to
lead the Wolfpack to a 100-72
triumph over Pitt in the Eastern
Regional Championship game.

The two-time All-American
scored 26 points and snared 12

 

rebounds against the Cats, in
addition to sinking all eight free
throw attempts.

Winters devastated Pitt with his

hot outside shooting to lead the-

Gamecocks to'a 67-50 win in
Columbia. The 6-Ssenior was the

'leading scorer in that contest with

23 points.

Unlike Brown. Mountaineer Levi
Phillips played well in his team's
losing effort. but not so well when
West Virginia defeated Pitt 82-78
at the start of the season.

Phillips had 11 points. four
rebounds. and four assists in that

For Jim Rooker:

BRADENTON. Fla. AP--Pitch-
ing is a glamorous life if you‘re a
Tom Seaver. Bob Gibson or Steve
Carlton. It means big money and
recognition. Jim Rooker wouldn't
know _about those things. For"
, Rooker. pitching has been a

, "Rooker, who won 10 games and
I lost 6, compiled a 2.86 ERA for the
Pittsburgh Pirates last season. He
insists he wouldn’t trade one bus
ride, one mile, one hamburger, one

matter of sticking withit. I knew I
could pitch in the big leagues. The
fact that I knew I had the ability
kept me going."

The 6-foot-1 Rooker, a native of
Lakeview, Ore.. says that only
once. in Kansas City four or five

’years ago. did he get discouraged.
He had second thoughts about
staying in the organization because
it was young and appeared to be
going nowhere. He felt. he wasn‘t
getting anything out ofit. He stuck
with it however. and finally things
began to fall into place. especially
the trade to the Pirates.

“Without a doubt coming to
Pittsburgh was my biggest break,”
says the 200-pound southpaw. “I
was in a rut at Kansas City. I
couldn’t seem to shake myself. I
know all players who get graded
say it, but it was like a new life.”

Why has it taken him so long to
develop into a major league
winner? He's at an age where most
pitchers are on the decline. not just
arriving. I

“The” biggest thing is that I
didn't really become a pitcher until
1964." Rooker says. “I was an
outfielder. So, I got a late start as
far as pitching experience is
concerned. Before that I pitched a
few times just to give the staff a
rest. I never pitched in organized

baseball until I reached the Detroit
organization." '

Rooker "started his National
League career in the bullpen. His
first 23 games were as a reliever.
He won the opening game of the
season in relief. It was June 27
before Rooker got his first start,
and he remained in the starting
rotation the rest of the season. He
set his pro career high with 41
appearances, equalled his best
winning season 10, pitched three
shuts and tied Doc Ellis for most
strikeouts 123.

“I more or less got everything

,together consistently for the first

time." Rooker says of his‘emer-
gence as a first rate pitcher. “I
walked a lot fewer. I've had control
problems before, I didn't change
anything." v‘
