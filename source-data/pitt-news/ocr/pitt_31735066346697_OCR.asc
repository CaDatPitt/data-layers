co—operatively in achieving a
worthwhile program.”

Chancellor

To Speak
On Campus

B Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld will address the student body
next Wednesday in the Student
Union Ballroom at 7:30 p.m., it
was announced recently. *

The speech, which will be sim-
ilar to the one delivered to stu-
dents during the recent parents’
Open House, will be in the form
of an informal “report ,on the
state of. progress at the ‘Univer-
sity.”

Addressing the student body
was suggested to the Chancellor
by several student leaders a few
weeks ago when they heard him
speaking to a group of high school
counselors at the University.

Am ong the students who
prompted the Chancellor to make
the address were Mary Lou Kar-

.ges, president of AWS; Richard

Sobota, president of SC}; Linda
Lee, secretary of AWS; and Steve
Johnson, president of. Men’s Coun-
cil.

Spokesmen for Dr. Litchfield
stated that he is preparing to
“discuss developments at the Uni-
versity, advances of the physical
plant, and possible changes in the
faculty and/or administration.”

An informal question-and- an-
swer period may follow
speech, as it did when the Chan-
cellor made his Open House ad-
dress. .

During Parents’ Weekend last
fall, Dr. Litchﬁeld spoke to the
students in a crowded SU Ball-
room for the purpose of “promot-

ing closer associations between.

the University Administration and
the ..student body.”

The Chancellor then opened the
ﬂoor to questions and many sub-
jects, principally tuition, were
discussed.

Nathan Firestone
Tap Day Speaker

By MATTEIEW NESVISKY

Nathan Firestone will be

the main speaker at tomor-

row’s Tap Day Banquet, chairman Charles Lebovitz recent-

ly announced.

Firestone, a senior Political Science major who will

graduate in April, will make an address which will conclude
a full day ofihonoring the University’s outstandingsstudents.

Speaking on “Areas, of Student¢
Responsibility,” Firestone calls his
address ,“an attempt to evaluate
relative success or failure of stu-
dent leadership in directing the
positive and vital atmosphere of
the University.”

He added that he will discuss
three areas of responsibility of
leadership: 1. Achieving True Ac-
ademic Attainment; 2. Meaningful
and Signiﬁcant Participation in
Activities; and 3. Awareness of
Events Beyond the University,
Especially in Politics.

“The foundation of the
speech,” Firestone a d d e d ,
“hinges on the term ‘student at-
mosphere.’ The traditional char-
acteristic of the responsible
leader is that he’s successfully
able to formulate purposeful
ideas that are carriedt hrought
to gainful ends.”

An international team of geophysicists is studying the
fundamental theories of earth magnetism at the University.
The project is being sponsored in part by a grant from the

Benedum Foundation of Pittsburgh.
A series of lectures on earth magnetism will also be held

as part. of this project. A sym

posium of. leading experts in

this ﬁeld will take place March¢
12 and 13.
Cambridge Professor Speaks
The first lectures will take place
during a visit of Dr. Robert Stone-
ly, retired Cambridge University
profess« of theoretical geophys-
ics. During his visit, which begins
today, he will met informally with
students and faculty, and will
also deliver several speeches.
Wednesday’s lecture will be
open to the public. Beginning at
8:15 pm., the lecture will be on
“Earthquakes and the Earth’s
Interior.” It will be held in 22

Part of the research will involve
“making” rocks in the laboratory
which have a stimulated age of

The research project by the
University scientists will have two
parts. Gathering and cataloguing
rock samples of different ages will
be the first part. These rocks will
have been subjected to various
degrees of temperature, pressure,
and chemical change since their
formation.

The artiﬁcial samples will be
sujected to various factors
which could affect their mag-

V. Reaves Questions
McCuire's Abilities

Editor, The Pitt News: _

First I would like to say that
Ruthie McGuire is a sweet girl
with an attractive personality.

My question is "whether she

could carry out the job of vice-
president of Student Govern-

ment. Could she wield the gave]
at Senate meetings with the re-
spect—essential to carrying out
the responsibility as.vice presi-
dent?

While Ruthie has proven her-
self -.- a good worker per se,
Student Government needs, in
addition to this, a person with
leadership abilities. Such a per-
son is Judy Diethorn.

Let’s not_elect simply a per-
sonality nor a “machine,” but a
team of leaders. Judy Diethorn
could, if elected, work most
effectively with Tom Olifson as
a team. Judy has not only
-shown herself a hard worker,
but a leader capable of running
and co-ordinating the Student
Government Senate.

5 Let’s not retire with McGuire.

Let us rather, elect a team that
will return drive and leadership

to Student Government.

  Letters to the Editor I

Student Mourns
Lack of Candidates

Editor, The ,Pitt News:

Each year students are pro-
mised a bigger and better Stu-
dent Government, but each year
when elections roll around the
chaos ‘presented in termsof par-
ties, platforms and reforms be-
comes ludicrous.

‘Students will no longer even
run in the number one position
as long as one candidate is pre-
sented to the body.
Whether it’s because the one
person is so capable that no
other students could even ap-
proach his position or not, an

student

uncontested contest is no con-
test at all. But it’s nice to know
that-the number two position is
so coveted in all areas.

This recalls the election of two-
years ago when two candidates
slid into position because no one
was interested enough to even
bother voting. If this happens
again, what’s the purpose of the

Representative’s Plan? Seems to
me no_one really wants to be
represented.

Maintaining the image . .5

Executive Material  

By Ina Aimwduir

A recent article in a national magazine de-
scribed the technique known as personnel pirating.
This kind of pirating is done by organizations the
sole purpose of which is to recruit executives from
one company for another. The
article mainly consisted of a de-
scription of the various tech- 
niques used by the pirates. The .
techniques themselv.es are not '_
laudable. But the most disturb- 
ing part of the article was that ?
section describing the reason
that some executives are not ~ _
hired. 

One would think that the 1
people hiring were fraternity
boys, not mature men. The
executive wishing to change jobs must not wear
bow ties, ﬂowered ties or argyle socks. He must
not have a mustache or be overweight. The com-
pany image must be sustained at all costs. Thin
muted ties, dark muted suits, and muted person-
alities are all in order.

Mule Training _ g

The interviewing agencies say that companies
looking to steal executives want a “Quiet, obedi-
ent comformist who will pulliwell with the team.”
He should have not noticeable oddities in person-
ality, manner or dress. A placid mule would prob-
ably be the best candidate. I

Even the wives are not free from scrutiny. Be-
fore the executive is hired, particularly if he is to
work in a small town, the wife is invited out to
lunch or dinner with her husband and some in-
terviewers. She is likely" t.o be observed for three
things. She must understand the proper use of
china and cutlery; she must hold her liquor and

 

she must display the proper attitude to the social - i

gathering, since there will be many more like’ it,
The company doesn’t care whether she says any-;
thing interesting or anything at all. As long as

she doesn’t get high or eat her ice-cream with a
fork, she’s the model executive's wife.

Then there was the story about the poor man . ‘

who almost was hired for a job and made ipne
fatal mistake. As he and his interviewers were
leaving the house where the interview was held,
he noticed a bottle of whiskey on the table. He
suggested that the group have a drink. On account .
of this faux pas "he was not hired. Exactly what

“was the mistake‘? He shouldn’t have initiated the

idea when he saw that the others hadn't suggested
it.
Formfii-ting Brass » .
Needless to say the article was rather dis-
heartening. It never seems to occur to the inter-
viewer that the clean-cut, ivy-‘league complacent
job-hunter may not be thelideal man for the
job. There seems to be an archetypal, precon-
ceived form for the /executive and he who can
most fully approximate the ideal form is hired.
In every area of our society the form exists.
And it never includes originality, imagination,

sensitivity or eccentricity. An American named 3

Henry Thoreau, who was much wiser than the
interviewers, once said that if a man marches out
of step, it may be because he hears a different
drummer. That different music which the man
hears might be better music than that of his in-
terviewers. If he continues to keep time to‘ his
own music, he may not get the better job, but
he will not have sold his soul to the man in the
gray-ﬂannel suit.

. Cabitzer

Sam is a cab driver and like most of his fellow
workers, he loves to talk, especially about the
University and its “big—wigs” as he calls them. If
you’re lucky, you’ll find Sam, if that really is his
name, parked across the boule-
vard from the Student Union, I
sprawled across the front seat of ,,
hisecab, his head resting on the
window sill with a battered blue 3
cap istretched just far ' enough
over his eyes to give the ap-
pearance of being asleep yet not
far enough_that‘he’ll miss a ﬁve-
dollar fare.

Leaving the Pitt News oﬂice
at 3 a.m., I expect to ﬁnd few 
people “alive and kicking” much
less eager to talk. But Sam can carry on a rapid-
fire conversation with himself, encouraged only
by an occasional “uh-huh” from this drowsy re-
porter. ‘ ' I i ’

. “You know fella,” he begins, “that’s quite at
I school you go to. My kid wants to go there some

day. Do you think he should?”
“NO.” ‘
“Your-‘head ‘man really made a mistake let-A
ting Dr. Salk get away like he did.” I learned

‘ later that Sam’s boy wants to/~.be a doctor, thus
‘the association. “I used to take him down to the

train station a lot. .He was a swell guy but not
just ‘cause he gave me a big tip. Right after he
discovered that polio medicine I took him "out to

gratulated him he said what would come in the

to carry them out to the cab. They even got sick

“Yeah, and speakin’ of booze, I almost got
clobbered tonight. This woman gets in and says

and she doesn’t have any money, so she says to

 Pitt Players Open /Jean Anouilh’s

‘Becket’ Frida

BY SUSANNE ECKIVIAN

"Becket," Jean Anouilh’s high

comedy which ran on? Broadway
in 1960, will open Friday night in
the Commons Room, CL.

The play, a Pitt Players produc-
tion, concerns the friendship and
later emnity "between Henry II,
the rather boorish King of Eng-
land (played by Jim Chapman),
and his more cultured Saxon
friend Becket (played by Peter
Schoenberg) who becomes Arch-
bishop of England.

Peter Schoenberg, who plays the
title role, is a part-time student
from England, the son of Professor
Schoenberg, Mellon Professor in
physics here. He came to America
in January, straight from‘ public
school (which in England is a pri-
vate school, and is visiting here
for this trimester. He plans to
visit France this summer before
returning to England to
Trinity’ College at Cambridge Uni-
versity.

‘Studying Philosophy and Russian

Peter is taking Freshman Philo-
sophy and Russian here and plans
to concentrate on moral scienc '
and philosophy at Cambridge;
This is his first major role and h_
thinks that Becket is “rather pro‘
found all together, with gre .

physical and mental capabilities—— '

essentially gay with streak of

humor.‘_’

Jim Chapman. co-star in the
play. is a sophomore who played
one of the conspirators in last
trimester’s production of "Julius
Caesar." He has acquired an
English accent for his part and
complements the elegance and
smooth gestures of Becket with
an impatient roughness of move-
ment.

"Becket" is a play with much
costuming and many scenery
changes. Because it takes place in
the Commons Room rehearsals can
be held only on weekends or after
the Cathedral is closed for the
night. and all properties. scenery,
and costumes must be stored each
night. \‘

New Political
Group To old
First M ceting

The Pitt Political Forum, a new
political discussion organization,
will hold its first meeting on Fri-
day at 4 p.m. in 306 SU. ..
Although the new group is not
officially recognized on campus,
Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant
chancellor of student and general
aﬁ.’ai.rs. has allowed them to hold
this organizational meeting. The
students are expected to apply for
recognition soon.

According to l\'lZll‘l.lIl Landy. one
of the founders of the new group,
“the Pitt Political Forum will be
unlike all other oolitical groups
previously established on this
campus.

“Actually," he added, "the pur-
pse of the organization is to pro-
vide a common ground for all the
political factions to discuss their
individual ideologies.”

Open to members of all po-
litical groups on campus, the
Forum will be modeled after
the British Parliament. A
speaker will be elected who will
regulate the debates or the
floor. In addition. a two-man
steering, or planning committee
will be selected to map the dis-
cussion calendar for the term.

Computers

To Store  

  Health Laws On Tape

By JACK! KATZ
Members of the Health Law service are busy develop-
ing reﬁning and information retrieval techniques by em-

ploying electronic computers.

“The .main purpose of this project is to be able to re-
trieve in a matter of minutes that information which might
take an attorney two days of library research to ﬁnd,”

Thomas B. _Walsh, manager of the‘

project, said. The project consists

b of converting laws from textbooks
to magnetic tapes. Attorney Gen-
eral opinions are also use.

A secretary copies the health
laws from law text books and
types them onto a ﬂexowriter. a
modiﬁed electric typewriter. Un-
"like a regular typewriter, the
ﬂexowriter transcibes the ma-
terial by punching holes in a ﬂexi-

' ble paper tape.

The tape is then converted to
IBM cards by an 047 Tape to.
Card Converter. They are then
listed on a 407 IBM printer and
the printouts are made. Print-
outs are sheets which contain
the reproduction of the infor-
mation from the law books. One
line of the printout is the equiv-
alent of one card.

“The next step,” Walsh stated,
“is to have the printouts proof-
read, checked, and corrected.”
Proofreading consists of two steps.
First the printouts are checked by
one person and then a team of
proofreaders check the copy by
reading the text to one another
and going over the printouts more
‘carefully.
Check Slowly" .
Checking process consists of go-
ing over the printout very slowly

‘ to see if any mistakes have been

missed. Corrections, are made by
retyping the cards on which there
are mistakes. These cards are
then hand merged into the orig-
inal deck In this process the
cards with mistakes are replaced
by the corrected ones.

After merging is completed,
the entire process is repeated
“up to the proofreading. At this
time the new printouts are com-

pared with the original ones to
insure ~ that all mistakes have
been caught and that no new
ones have been made.

The cards are taken to the com-
puting center and put through a
card reader computer. This tran-
scribes the data onto magnetic
tapes.VThese tapes are generated
onto new tapes according to their
titles and sections. This makes it
easier to retrieve a speciﬁc sec-
tion. All machine operations are
done on the IBM 7070 computer.

Horty Director

Director of the project is Dr.
John F. Horty Jr. All computing is
done at the Computation and Data
Processing Center, which is un-
der the direction of William Kehl.
The Center is located on the
eighth floor of the Cathedral.

“The Schools of Education
and Law, and the Graduate
School of Public Health have
been very cooperative and have
assisted the Health Law Serv-
ice greatly,” Walsh stated.

The proofreading is done entire-
ly by students of the University.
At present there are 22 men em-
ployed. Night superviser is Bill
Sadler.

The University Panel on Inter-
cultural Relations has only twelve
hard core members. An average
of ten people attend their biweek-
ly meetings. They ‘have one of-
ﬁcer and have -been in existence
since September.

In
“they have the potential,” accord-
ing to foreign student advisor
Rene‘Lichenstein, “to produce a

catalytic effect on the attitudes of"

students and the people they come
in contact with towards other cul-
tures.” ’ ‘

5.” Judy Edwards is the group’s one
officer-——the secretary. “Our goal
is to make the students aware.of_
the cultures and attitudes of peo
ple from other countries.” ' .. .-

Small Groups"

The meetings, held in 201 Amos
Hall, are small discussion groups.
Frst a speaker from a foreign
country, or an_ American student
who has just returned‘ from visit-
ing in a foreign country addresses
the group. Then, those present at
the meeting.‘ take pgre with the
speaker in a panel discussion.

“This contract of American
studen’ ‘ with those foreign stu-
dents living on mmpus at the

 University can be the stepping-

off point for many friendships,” '

Miss Edwards said. 3
Vicki Buchsbaum, one of the
four members of the club’s plan-
ning committee emphasized that
the club’s operations are not on a
large scale. ‘

Offers Much

“We don't expect a tremendous
elffec,” shesaid, “but our pro-
grams do offer further opportuni-
ties for those students on campus
interested in cultures other than
their own.”

Last trimester the Intercultural

_‘_ Relations Panel had discussions on
"‘“The Role of the University Stu-
dent in— Japan,” and “The Teacher
in Contemporary “Iran.” Speakers
for these two programs were
members of the Fulbright Science
Teachers Training Program.

Another program this past
Fall was a weekend seminar on
Africa and America. African
students attending tri-state col-
leges were participants in the
seminar, as well as an equal
amount of University students,
both American and African.

This semester’s activities are’

again set up either as panel dis-
cussions or seminars. This evening
-tyat 7 p.m. the panel discussion will
~"’. be: “Is There a Barrier Between
, American and Eoreign Students?”
' Students from .Latin America,
1 Asia, and Africa will join the pro-
gram.
I I All Welcome
Miss Edwards said that all in-

  

to join this evening’s meeting and

K all other meetings. ‘Interest con-

E."-i stitutes membership,” she said.

A Although the Panel is, at the
present, a.re1a'tively small organi-

‘ zation, the group hopes to realize
‘a large increase in student par-

 ticipation in the near future.

. _‘ On March 21 the club will hold

 seminar on birth control. April

Pro essor Sa vedi  rt n War

By KAREN HALPERT

Nearly ‘two decades ago, shortly
after the United States entered
World War II, Dr. "Ernest T. De-
Wald, as Director of Monuments
and Fine Arts with the Allied
Military Government in Italy and
Austria, began the task of pro-
tecting the famous. "monuments
and art_ objects from the war’s
damage. ‘ ’

“We were concerned,” said the
present viting Mellon, Professor,
“with keeping the damage to a
minimum, and we asked the Air

Force not to use these master- r

pieces as targets in their bomb-
ings.” ‘

Along with building shelters to
protect famous church walls and
performing ﬁrst-aid work with
the damaged monuments, Dr. De-

Wald and the members of his di-I

vision tried to track down various

masterpieces takenby the Nazi '

armies.

In a series of salt mines in Aus-
tria the Nazis were storing works
of arts taken from large privte
anti-Nazi and Jewish .col1ecti_ons,
an example of which ‘is the high-
ly-valued Rothchild collection.

Dr. DeWald was also con-
cerned with protecting histor-
ically and artistically —valued_
buildings from occupation by
wandering troops. “Once a

nursing unit wanted to occupy
a famous villa in Rome with
deoration by Raphael,” Dr. De-
Wald recalled. . “We stopped
them just as they wanted to put
a stove pipe through one of the
priceless walls.”-

There was also the problem of
military rank. “As an army major,
as I was then, I couldn’t walk up
to a Brigadier General and tell
him not to occupy things. We had
to get an order from General Eis-
enhower before we could do any-
thing.”

One of the biggest threats to the
monuments we're bombings from
the air. Dr. DeWald recalls how
the Air Force aided him by mark-
ing the relics with white circles
on the ﬂight maps, so the pilots
would know which building to
avoid.

“After the bombing the mon-
‘uments stood out like sore
thumbs,
tened area ” he commented.‘
“We like to think that it’: par-

on an otherwise ﬂat- .

ticularly through our brieﬁng

that the monuments are still
standing.” . ~

Dr. DeWald was born in New
Brunswick, New Jersey in Sep-
tember, 1891. He attended Rutgers
University where he obtained his
A.B. in 1911 and his L.H.D. in
1946. He also received a masters
degree from Princeton in 1914,
and a PhD. in 1916.

Won Awards

A member of Delta Upsilon fra-
ternity and Phi Beta Kappa, he
has received a number of awards
including the Chevalier de la
Couronne de Belgique, Order of
British Empire, and the Stella del-
la Solidarrieta from the Italia
government. “

.A good sword nowadays is hard to ﬁnd-and in olden times, too. Many a
feudal lord saw it pointless to joust with a faulty halberd, and for worthy steel
alone the Vislgoths sacked \Rome.

Today, centuries later, the search for stronger steels goes on. And among those
making most dramatic strides‘ in advancing the state of the metallurgical art
are the research teams at Ford's Scientiﬁc Laboratory in Dearborn. Michigan.
In exploring the "world of microstructure." these scientists, using methods of
extreme sophistication_,‘have been able to look at iron and steel on a near-
atomic scale. They have discovered secrets of nature leading to new processing
iechniqueswhich yield steels of ultra,-high strength unknown a decade ago.

The promise of s.uch‘~techniques seems limitless. As man develops the needs

and means to travel more "swiftly on earth and over interplanetary reaches- i

wherever economy’ of weight and space is required-—st'rength of physical
materials will become paramount. This is another example of how Ford is gaining
leadership through scientiﬁc research and engineering.

larly interesting situation.

is beginning a process of rejuv-
enation by which the organization
will become ‘a discussion group
while still retaining its active
role in the campaigns of election
years. ‘

Encouraged by response to ten-
tative explorations into the world
of discussion, members of the
group are sponsoring a member-
ship drive by which they hope to
determine the subjects and speak-
er that students would like to
hear. The group has previously
presented such speakers as Woody
Turner, last year’s “Mr. Pitt.” and
Harry Harawitz, president of the
Pittsburgh chapter of Student
Sane.

Perhaps the unusual nature
of the organization stems from
the unusual character of its
leader. Judy _Cohen is a “tri-
mester senior” in the school of
Liberal Arts. She is a political
science major, but she has never
even considered the possibility
of a career in politics.

“I only started getting interest-
ed in politics during the 1960
elections," she said. “It was the
time that I ﬁrst discovered
whether I was a Democrat or a
Republican."

Likes Drama

.“l\/ly interest in liiie is drama,”
she said, a field, she maintained,
which isn't really far removed
from politics.

During her professional career

with the Pittsburgh Opera Com-
pany, appeared» in summer stock
presentations of such plays as
“Little Mary Sunshine" and “A
Room Full of Roses,” has acted
for two years with the C tholic
Guild, and has appearedzlin a
TV series on WQED.

She has also appeared on -a
TV program in Harrisburg with
Anne X. Alpern, unsuccessful
candidate for the Pennsylvania
State Supreme Court.

Young Democrats Seti
Rejuvenation Of Club

President Judy Cohen Interested In Drama:
Organization To Serve As Discussion
By STAN STEIN
Uniqueness is becoming an increasingly rare
things nowdays, but in the midst. of the recent trend to-
ward the formation of “non—action, discussion” groups, an
organization known as Young Democrats presents a singu-

Group

quality in

Previously an action group operating on a once every
four year basis, Young Democrats0‘*“s**  '

It would appear that her con-
tact with governmental person-
alities and her ﬂair for the dra-
matic, her knowledge of what
things appeal to an audience, have
acted as catalysts in Young Dem-
ocrats’ revitalization program.

Little Glamor

In connection with this pro-
gram; Judy stated, “Today there
isn’t as much glamour in the elab-
orate appeals‘ to people as Re-
publicans or Democrats as there

used to be. People don’t want toi

become indentiﬁed with an ex-

treme organization.”

“The success of
organizations.” she continued,
“therefore depends upon the pre-

sentation of other theories.”

In answer to questions con-
cerning organizations such as
John Birch Society and Student
Sane, Judy stated, “None of
the members of our organiza-
tions took ‘part in the demon-
stratior against the Birchers
because we feel that mass re-
sponse and demonstration is in
bad taste." --

,She added, however, “We have
—a lot more to fear from the right
than from the left in our coun-
try. The right is the most "sig-
nificant cause for alarm.”

In summing up her political ob-
servations, Judy said, “It is amaz-
ing how much politicians are like
actors. There is a bad connotation
about politicians but people don‘t
really know why they have this
connotation."

“It Goes On..."

 

Commodore Peery I
Wrestling coach Rex Peery is only going to take ﬁve
or six wrestlers to the NCAA championships in Oklahoma
this month. Athletic Director Frank Carver, with an eye on
the budget and a book of logic, explains it this way: “Last
year we sent a whole bunch of boys to the:IC4A cross-
country championships and I think we\ got something like
a fourth of a point. ' , ».
“From now on we’re not sending anyone anywhere un-
less they have a chance of scoring,” he said. Peery has a
choice of taking Duff Killian to the NCAA as an entrant in
the 115—pound class. This is not a regularly contested class
during the season, and Killian, a sophomoreiwho was held
out of action this year because of the presence of Rich Mar-
tin in the 123-pound class, would lose a year of eligibility if
he was used. —

“I don’t know what to do,” Peerysays. “Dul’f’s a real
good boy, but I know of at least three guys in the country
who I think are better. Still his chances of advancing in
the tourney are good. But you never can tell.

“One time, in a similar case, I took Paul Powell to the
NCAA where he was going to be in the same 115-pound
class. Paul couldn’t get down quick enough, and the doctor
said it would be dangerous for him to lose any more weight
after he was down to 118. But we let him wrestle anyhow,
when there were a couple of guys who I thought werebet;
ter, but he mopped them up,--and won the 123-pound title.

Mari-lal Silence , _

Peery told his wrestlers the other day the following
dictum: “If you have a girl friend, stay away from her
awhile. And if you’re married. don’t even talk to your wife.
I want you in peak physical condition and I don’t want any
distractions ruining your chances of winning honors in the
Easterns or in the NCAA.”

"Apparently the hugging and embracing that goes on,

during a match when the wrestlers are entwined in one an-
other is contagious. Five of the starting nine grapplers are
married, a few being fathers, and several of the subs are
student-husbands. . V
‘‘In our last match,” Peery-said, W‘ﬁ‘the three guys lIl_.tl1€
worst shape that day were the ones that weren’t married.
So you can’t blame losses on a wedding ring. I was married .
when I won one of my own NCAA titles.’:. He also had_a
son named Hugh who later won three titles himself in
the same extravaganza. . .
Odd rules aren’t peculiar to Peery. He insists that his
men be well—groomed and presentable. One time he made
NCAA champ Joe Solomon shave his goatee off and Change
his hairstyle from his ducktail sweep. “He didnt think he

 was Solomon or anything,” Peery recalled. “The hair. didn’t

. V tlers money to go see a movie in a

conserve his strength. It just irritated his opponents.

Hacking Hair Away , _ , _ ‘
On a road trip once upon a time, Peery gave his Wies-
group. He took one boy

74;. ,'aside;’ gave him the same amount of cash and said, “Now git

, .‘'"I? ,r‘
.~._\,.v

- at

to the nearest barber shop and get your hair cut.” .
’ One of the equipment men who takes care of his
wrestling paraphernalia says, ‘‘I have keen eyes to see that
there are no moth holes in their tights or Peery will false
hell with me. You’d think he was Dior putting on a fash-
, ion show.” _
Peery«manages, however, to put on quite a show, and he
wins. So, apparently, he isn’t too hard on his boys. Those
close to the scene say that Peery has even softened up a bit

_ V in recent years.

Still, none of his wrestlers have. They are going to be
dark-horse candidates in both the NCAA and Eastern Cham-
pionships. Lehigh is rated best in the East, and only Peery s

Vance Carter Paces Track Pack

In Indoor ICZIA Meet In N. Y.

Immigrants are awed b_V_th€

moves in New York. For once
they shouldn’t be disappointed if
they see the Panther trackmen in
action in the Big City. This year.
the IC4A entrants from Pitt are
a respectable lot, with C1U'c*1'i91"
miler Vance Carter leading the
way. ,

_ Other members of the track

Clark and Al Thomassy respec-
tively. .
Last year Discus Thrower Dan
Kanell was the only Panther who
could be considered a threat in
Eastern events. Carter is a little

town folk this year, however,
lhafter doing so well there last year.
He ran the third fastest time in
the history of an invitational

EIGL Prelims
Tough To Pass

Panther gymnasts compet-
ing in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Gymnastic League In-
d i V id u al Championships
found it hard to pass the pre-
liminary round which would
qualify them for .....
the ﬁnals and
possible medals
in~their respec-
tive events. V

In order to
qualify, a per-
former m u s t
have one of the
top eight scores.
Pitt men cop-
ped the deﬂat-
ing ninth posi-
tion three times.

Bob Pingatore

Earl McConnell, who won the free
exercise gold medal and the sec-
ond place award in the tumbling
event, bowed to Cecil Tune of
Navy on the parallel bars by one

point to take the undesirable

ninth.

Ed Zamecnik can also boast of
a hard luck story. Suffering from
a cold, Zamecnik lacked his usual
spark and failed to qualify on the
long horse, horizontal bar, still
rings, side horse, and free exer-
cise.' He came in ninth in the free
exercise preliminaries.

Zamecnik did qualify on the
parallel bars and placed fifth in
the ﬁnals. Teammate John Fran-
chuck, entering only the P—bar
division, came in seventh.

The third Panther to take a pre-
liminary ninth was Ed Stim. Wil-
liam Wright of Temple topped
Stim by three points. Stim also
tried his hand at side horse but
did not fare so well as Roland
James. James held down the
fourth slot in qualifying but drop-
ped to eighth in the finals.

Bob Pingatore, selected by many

Pitt ﬁnishing a distant second.

Better Pinners

One advantage the Engineers
will have over the Panthers is the
fact that they are better pinners.
In tournament action each team
picks up a point every time one
of their men advances.

This differs in the case of a
pin when two points are given
for an advancement. Lehigh is
noted for the ability for putting
their opponents shoulders on
the mat and this should be 21

Other points are picked up by

Seeds Important
Another important aspect of
the tournament is how the wrest-
lers are seeded. There are sixteen
wrestlers in each ‘division, one
from every school. Eight of these
grapplers are seeded. I

These eight face the eight un-
seeded wrestlers in the first
round. If things :0 according
to the plans of the seeding com-

Another chapter in the bitter rivalry between Pitt and
Lehigh will unfold this weekend at the Eastern Wrestling
Tournament. Although 16 teams are entered, pre—tourney
prognostications ‘point to another dog ﬁght between the two

Eastern powerhouses.

two schools, but Lehigh soundly
thrashed them in the Easterns.
Thisseason the Engineers won the
dual meet, so maybe it is the Pan-
ther’s turn to take the tourna-
ment.

The overall strength of the two
teams is so even that it would be

brackets, in addition tophaving a

slim chance of ﬁnishing the first

four in the 130 pound division.

Quick Analysis ..

Here is the way the various
weight classes shape up, along
with the Panther lineup.

123 POUNDS——Rich Martin. De-

 

iending champion Martin is in a
‘class by himself in the East. It

would take an upset of major pro-
portions to unseat him. If it is to
be done the most likely culprits
are Floyd Welker of Army, Co-
1umbia’s Jim Balquist, and Bill
Merriam and Larry Nealson of
Lehigh and Syracuse respectively.
More likely, however, these four
will battle it out for second place.

130 POUND S——Sherm Mayer.

This is the most wide open class
in the tournament with Penn
State’s Bob Haney, Lehigh’s Pat
smartt and Dick Janish of Rut-
gers being the favorites. Others
with long shot chances of win-
ning are Sonny Greenhalgh of
Syracuse, Fred Crawford of
Navy and Army's Ed Winbornl;
Moyer’s pre-Army form would
have been good enough to take
this division, but he has yet to
show thatability this season. He
is, however, capable of ﬁnishin
in the top four. ‘

Zolikoff Healed ‘ 1

A 137 POUNDS——John Zolikoff.
Zolikoff will have to improve on
his recent formto defeat Navy’s
Mike Harmon. The fact that he is

1 over his shoulder injury and able

to work out fully‘ should aid Zo1i-
koff’s chances. Lehigh’s Curt Al-
exander could knock off both Har-
mon and Zolikoff and Rutger’s
Frank Leta ranks as a darkhorse.

147 POUNDS-—Daryl Kelving-
ton. Kelvington will have to .
turn the tough trick of beating
dsﬁending champion Ron Pifer if
he is to win. On a good day
Daryl is capable of this. He can’t
be counted out. Neither can Ar-
my's ‘Mike Natvig, who was run-_
ner up to Pifer last year. Dick

Slutsky of Syracuse could cause
trouble.

157 POUNDS-—Augie Arrigone.

An upset of returning title-holder
Kirk Pendleton is inconceivable.
Arrigone could ﬁnish second and
pick up some valuable.’ points for
the Panthers.

Army Ace_ Tops
167 POUNDS —- Jim Harrison.

The drop in weight, from 177 to
167 pounds by AI-my’s Al Rushatz
makes this former 177 pound
champion the man to beat. Har-
rison and Le- a "
high’s Dave An-
gell can both do
it. Harrison has j
a chance for ’
the title, but
could also ﬁnish
third.

1 Mittmen, Start

Training At

Field House

By’ SANDY RESNICK

Baseball Coach Bobby
Lewis looks forward to the
Panthers’ 1962 season with
pure optimism. “We expect
to win them all,” commented
Lewis. “You’d be a pessimist
if you thought any. other way.”
In preparation for the expected
successful season, the mittmen

have begun spring training in the
Field House. .
Presently, they are doing gen-
eral conditioning drills to get in
shape for the rugged schedule

which includes eleven ‘home
games. The opener will be at
Forbes Field against California
State Teachers College next
month. ’

“Competition for the team is'

tough and lettermen will have to
hustle if they want to keep their
starting berths,” claims Lewis. So
far, 34 hopefuls have tried out for
the team and there will be more
coming since basketball season is
completed. Four freshmen basket-

ball players are expected to trade-

their’ gym shoes for spikes.
Hope For Reverse

Many players who gained ex-
perience by competing in last
year's lopsided 5-10 season will
return in hopes of reversing this
record. Ralph Shutterly, a two
year letterman, will earn his third
letter on the pitching mound. He

‘will attempt to better his poor

    

wrestle for
nine minutes, " .
like he did Al Ruschatz 1
for six against Penn State’s Phil ;
Myer he could win it all. Still.
Lehigh’s Jim Detrixhe is a
solid favorite. Myer, Don Cory ‘
of Rutgers and Tom Uber of 1
Navy will challenge Barr for the 1

second spot. - 

191 POUNDS —-Tom J.effries'

Jeﬁries at his best is too good for
any Eastern 191 pounder. When
he is not at his best he can be
beaten by Lehigh’s Chuck Moore,
Penn State's "Ed Pohland and
Denny Focht of Rutgers.

Ware Dorkhorse

HEAVYWEIGHT -- Jeff Ware.
Dale Khhns of Army and Rutger’s’
Ed Scharer are co-favorites here;
Lehigh’s John Burns should placed
Jeff Ware, although he has very.
little chance of placing could pickj
up some advancement points fori
the Panthers. ‘

Both Pitt and Lehigh will
have to be on they lookoutfor
upsets. If a top, . notch man
. should be surprised in the open-
ing round it would cost the team
the loss of all of that man’s ad-

vancement points plus his place-- M’

"\

ment points. ;
The head to head - battles at
137 pounds between Zolikoff and
Alexander, at 167 pounds between.
Harrison and Angel], at" 177
pounds between Barr and Detrixhej
and at 191 pounds between Jeff-'1
ries and Moore will have strong{
effect on the outcome of the tour-;
nament. _ ' 1
If either the Panthers or Lehigh
can ﬁnish in front in all four of
these classes or at least three they
have an excellent chance of taking
it all. _ P
Rutgers, Penn State, and Army,
should ﬁght for the third SP0t but’

Reviewing the season Coach
Ben Grady had this to say, “I
was very well pleased with. the
way our boys performed this year.
They were always in there pitch-

~ would step in and turn in an ex-
ceptional performance."

 
 

Looking ahead to next sea-
son, Coach Grady will have es-
sentially the some squad re-
turning. The only loss through
graduation will, be team cap-
tain Tony Sarsﬁeld. Because
this year’s sophomores will have
some experience under their
belts by next season, the team
should be improved.

“We always hope the sopho-
mores will profit by their experi-
ence,” commented Coach Grady,
“and we are hopeful they will im-

V prove by next year.”

Problem Serious

The 1962-1963 edition of the
Pitt basketball team will be es-
sentially the same as this year’s
squad. Only co-captains Bob San-
key and Tom Maloney will be
gone. Even though these boys saw
limited service during the second
half of the season, their loss
leaves Coach Bob Timmons with
a bench problem. '

Most teams do not win games
with only five players and coach
Timmons knows this only too
well. Next year’s reserve team
will be made up of a not very»
impressive freshman team and
two of the seven bal.l.playe-rs who
saw a lot of action this campaign
remaining as substitutes next sea-
son.

The five starting players n.ex"t"‘
year are by no means picked yet.
It is true that the Panthers must
rely on the rebounding of Brian
Generalovich and Paul Krieger
and the scoring of Cal Sheffield,
Ben Jinks and Dave Sauer, but it
remains to be seen whether these
boys can profit from their exper-
ience.
