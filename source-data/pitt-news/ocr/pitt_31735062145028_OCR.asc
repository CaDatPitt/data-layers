ESTABLISH JUNIOR
UNIONTOWN COLLEGE

Fayette County School Heads
Approve Second Pitt
Junior School

Final approval by superintendents

and principals of Fayette county
high schools of plans for the estab-
lishment of Pitt's second junior col-
lege to be located in Uniontown is
expected Monday, F. W. Shockley,
director of the University extension
division, announces. Unanimous en-
dorsement by the Uniontown board
of education of junior.college plans
presented by Pitt representatives
was given last week.
E"--The nexest junior college ‘will be
opened next fall, if present plans go
through, states Mr. Shockley. The
committee which conferred with
Uniontown board of education offi-
cials last week was Walter B. Jones,
professor of research education,
John Wallace, research associate,
and Shockley.

The junior college as planned for
Uniontown _ will offer courses in
freshman and sophomore subjects
under the supervision of a faculty
of ten members. It will be estab-
lished without cost to the city or to
the board o'f education’. Entrance
requirements will be the same as
those of the University.- Late after-
noon, evening and summer school
classes will be offered.

. Uniontown -is in an‘ excellent posi- '

tion for the establishing of a junior
college_ according to the research de-
partment of the University which
has completed a long and detailed
investigation. There ‘is a population
of 125,000 people within a radius of
twelve miles and one out of every
fourgraduates in Fayette "county is
a graduate of Uniontown high
school. “Uniontown, South and North
Township High Schools this year
will graduate 400 seniors out of a
total enrollment of 1,600 in those
high schools, it is announced.

There are more than 5,500 stu-
dents enrolled in high schools within
a radius of twelve miles of Union-
town. . Uniontown presents the
greatest ac€essability- from railroad,
trolley and‘-bus lines of any com-
munity in Western Pennsylvania,
says Mr. Shockley.

» After a two days’ program includ-
..liig....dis,.cusaion. .of..p.robl.ems. vital to
sororities, the first annual intercol-
.legiate Panhellenic conference for
urban universities held here last
week came to a close with a formal
ban net and presentation of the
scho arship cup to Alpha Xi Delta

- at Heinz house Friday night. -

Formal organization ‘of the inter-
collegiate Panhellenic association for
urban universities was effected at
the conference and Pittsburgh Pan-
hellenic appointed chairman. The
conference last week was the ﬁrst of
its kind in the country.

Ten round table discussions led by
Pitt co-eds were held.

That‘ fraternity girls should be,
and are responsible for social con-
ditions on the campus, was the key-
note of an address by Mrs. Georgia
Lloyd-Jones, associate" editor of the
Tulsa Tribune, Tulsa, Oklahoma,
and representative of National Pan-
hellenic Congress, given at a mass
meeting for. fraternity women
Thursday at Heinz house. “In main-
taining the highest standards, the
fraternity girl keepskfh
Greek ideals upon whiclliigraternities
were founded: simplici and re-
sponsibility, responsibility to self
and to law observance," said Mrs.
Lloyd-Jones. 0

Thursday and Friday were de-
voted to a discussion of problems en-
countered by sororities in urban uni-
versities. A study of the pledge
period produced new aspects on the
subject. Various criticisms and sug-
gestions resulted in a decision that
this period be long enough to enable
the pledge to know the ideals of the

Friendliness to members of other
fraternities, good scholarship‘, and
participation in activities both for
her own good and for her fraternity,
should be required of every pledge,
conference members decided.
Thursday evening a mock cere-
mony in which the present officers
of Panhellenic were installed was
performed in order to show the value
of rituals in building Panhellenic
spirit. The ceremony, which was
Greek in spirit and characterization,
was enacted by the active and silent
representatives of each sorority in

GLEE CLUB PLODS WEARY WAY THROUGH SNOW TO GIVE CONCERT TWO HOURS LATE

By Wilson S. Borland

“Take a bus!”

If you have heard such an ana-
thema pronounced on the campus,
you may be sure that the ‘pro-
nouncer was a member of the travel-
worn Pitt Glee Club which took a
trip into the provinces Monday and
presented its opening concert at
Johnstown.

Such phrases as, “All right, men,
all out. She's slipping. . . .where’s
the ashes? Oh, McGee, have you
got the jack? Push, you guys!"
awaken no fond memories for the
ﬁfty gleemen who spent eight hours
making a two-hour trip.

These fifty men ﬁlled two big
green buses at the dental infirmary
and started "about 3 o'clock. Within
ﬁfteen minutes onebus had broken
down and its ‘occupants were trans-

be

after a V. A fatty-ﬁve-minute

delay, to a two-headed $12,000 twin
coach. This bus was the jinx. I

Scheduled for an 8:15 o'clock con-
cert, the club arrived in Johnstown
at 10 o'clock. This -gem of all buses’
was pushed up about ten hills and
dug out of a snow drift where it
had hidden its head. Not con-
tent with these little tricks, the bus
developed motor trouble. One of the
fine twin motors went on a bust and
the coach went the last half of the
journey with a single, rather phthis-
ical, lung.

Despite all handicaps the club
gave a concert to a patient audience
that waited two hours. The boys
were tired and as a result the sing-
mg was a bit ragged, with a stray
bass breaking loose and several
tenors going falsetto now and then.
Sweet and Low and ‘The Cerebral
Dinosaur were the best sung‘ num-"
bers of the evening. ‘ The

and thus muffling their voices. .

After this shortsrecital, the com-
pany, assembled in a restaurant and
gleed some more to the accompani-
ment of knives and forks. The popu-
lation of Johnstown was given a
sample of Pitt vocalization. The
I113-118$! saysfthat he doesn't know
how much it will cost to fix the
chandelier.

The trip back was a repetition of
the last half of the up trip--for the
occupants of the jinx. Innumerable
times ‘the half-frozen, water-logged
51118ers were roused from their
snoozes to “iet out and push, you
8'03‘; Keep er goin’.” Innumera-
ble times they trudged through two-
f°°l5vd1'lfl-S.’_ The pushes started with
one ten minutes out from Johns-
townfand 'coiitinued until six o'clock

The jinx was parked in B1airs-
ville and its victims continued by
train. The other bus arrived back
at the Inﬁrmary at 8:30, its lug-
gage in the same state as when it
was put on the afternoon before—-
there was no time to use “tunes”
that concert.

Never a more bleary-eyed crowd
made its way into Pittsburgh than
this one. Fifteen hours without
sleep will play havoc with one's
beauty.

The drivers, “Bill" and “Frank,”
are henceforth idols of the club.

One memorable incident was the
sight of a certain member of the
club pouring motor oil into a can
and then into an empty whisky bot-
tle before getting down on his knees
to lubricate the recalcitrant motor.

quite. empty, from a garage man

Some fraternities have a “superb 
iority complex,” others have an “in-: ~ 
feriority complex,” but the Sigiiia  .
Pi fraternity has a. new afllictionall-,, ‘ J; 3;“
its own which might be called‘ the} . 
“name complex.” This new com"-4 ‘jff
plex, however, is neither a-leaning.‘ ‘ 
toward or against an egotistical at-" "
titude of the members, or an abun-’
dance of a ris t o c r atic, “J,ohn,.;
Henries,” but merely an unfortunate‘
circumstance of having severalpairl
of men with the same names.

The list begins with the two Nor- 
man Parks of mixed mail and tele-, I ‘
phone call fame, and who can be dif-
ferentiated only by their celebrated ‘
nicknames, “Schenley” and “High- _ .
land.” Then there is George Smith I
and Emmett Smith who have plenty’ . I”
of trouble distinguishing themselvea .
even outside of the fraternity just
because there are approximately-‘

 

I

 

s fourteen thousand Smiths in Pittse ~~

burgh. Woodward Adams can no
longer be called plan “Adams” up
around the house because John
Adams has recently been pledged.
Likewise Clarence E. Philli s must V.
be called “Horse” since Wi lain E. ,
Phillips has joined the pledge ranks.

Other close dio names are H. B.
McKinney and H. J. Enney, and,
Archie Geesin and Edwin Geese .
Last semester many telephone stain
were mixed because the pledge 311- . -
swering the phone could not‘
whether Baur, Baehr or Bowers was
wanted. -

So the secretary of Sigma Pi must
be extra precautions when he marks
roll book on meeting nights. And it
is advised that if you call any mem-
ber of the fraternity you had better
know his first, middle,  nod
“nick" name; his height, weight, cola» ,
or of his hair and eyes; what

Pittsburgh Pauhellcnic as the assem-
bled Greeks, by Jeanne King as For-
tuna; Diana Vujnovic, Adelaide Mills
and the guards of Fortune, Kather-
ine Till and Jane Thompson. Ruth
Matteson, Theta Phi Alpha, was in-
stalled as president; Alice McAf_ee,
Alpha Delta Sigma, vice president;
Elizabeth Pearsall, Beta Phi Alpha,
secretary, and Freda Radcr, Phi
Sigma Sigma, treasurer. Upon Mar-
garet Morrissey Phi Mu, was be-
stowed the laurel wreath, the symbol
of Greek ideals, in-recognition of her
work as last year’: president.
The formal banquet Friday eve-
ning at Heinz house for members of
Pittsburgh Panhellenic association,
visiting delegates and ests ob-
served Greek customs and deals with
Richard Halli'burton's “Glorious Ad-
venture” as its theme. Dean Thyrsa
W. Amos as toastmistress and the
s eakers of the evening conducted
t e assembled Greeks on a visit to
ancient Greece. Following the din-
ner, in the manner of the Greeks of
old, Dean Amos poured a libation to
the goddess Hygoid and the goddess
of Wisdom. In leading the frater-
nity girls into the glorious adven-
ture Dean Amos cautioned them to
remember that “until we leave the
realm of the material and enter the
realm of the Spirit we miss the most
glorious adventure of all."
Ruth Matteson, president of Pitt's
Panhellenic association, as guide to
the Porch of the Maidens, a vast
portico supported by six graceful
Greek maidens, suggested that so-
rority girls like these Greek maidens
bear their responsibilities gracefully.
Miss Louise Hetherington, president
of City Panhellenic association, was
goddess of the Temple of Wingless
ictory and in that role she re-
sented -to Alpha Xi Delta the sc ol-
arship cup which is annually given
to the -sorority with the highest
scholastic standing in Pittsburgh
Panhellenic association. -
From the throne of Zeus Mrs.
George Lloyd-Jones heard the thun-
der hurled from Mt. Olympus, but
she said, “it is the thunder which
ushers in the dawn.” Mrs. Lloyd-
Joiies believes that she will always
remember not only the numerous
steps at Pitt but also the vision she-
has caught here, “to work within the
fraternity group and to work for
other groups.” .. _
The spirit of the Parthenon, Unity,
was brou lit to the assembled Greeks
by Dorotliy Davis, chairman of the‘
committee in charge of the confer-
ence. Miss Edith Bui-tonf of S a-
cuse University, speaking in be alf

well to Lotus‘ Land. Courage, ideal-

ism, intellectualism, fellowship and
responsibiyity were the ﬂowers

plucked in this Lotus Land, and they

were to be taken backlby each of 4
the delegates to their own groups,

she said. In keeping with Greek

customs Miss Amos presented to the

guests a gift, the ‘Bowl of Conﬁdence.

The singing _of the Alma Mater

brought the Greeks back through the

years to Pittsburgh.

Representatives from the eleven"
urban universities are either the of‘-
ﬁcers of their Panhellenic associa-
tions or were especially elected no

Plans for alumni activities ‘on
Commencement Day, Wednesday,
June 13, were discussed thoroughly
at the regular quarterly meeting of
Alumni Council Monday night at
the Faculty Club. '

The entertainment committee is
headed by Helen Hunt, chairman,
and this committee was instructed
to arrange for an aﬂ"air’ somewhat
-diﬂerent from those held in the past.
Instead of a rather formal banquet
held at a downtown. hotel com-
mencement night, a less informal
affair will be held some place in the
Oakland district, possibly at the
Syria Mosque. Plans for this are
now being developed and will be an-
noupced-soon by Miss Hunt. This
event will be very attractive to all
alumni and should bring a big

crowd out, pgssibly double in size
any that w ch attended a com-
mencement alumni affair in recent
years.

committees showed that everyone is
very active, and that much is being
accomplished this year in the de-

Banning Finals.
, . (Iowa State Student.)
A ’ EGULAR semester examinations are being elimi-
‘  nated at Drake University and in their place will
lie substituted short quizzes at frequent intervals. Dean
Holmes Cowper believes that the new plan will be a
 fair and adequate test of student intelligence.
v ] A similar plan seems to. be gradually coming into
 at Iowa State- A few of the instructors, evi-
. ilintly sharing Dean Holmes Cowper’s belief, are using
I  but the quiz system in their courses, god it
 seem that such a plan, having proved its worth
, in other schools, could well be accepted by the Iowa
7 ,ltate faculty as a whole.
 Perhaps the most outstanding advantage of the
 plan is its fairness to the student. It is im-
possible to prepare a set of questions for a 50-minute
gﬁamination which will be a fair test of the student's
 of six weeks or twelve weeks of study. If
 of several instructors were asked to formulate a

 of questions covering a quarter’s work in history
of chemistry or some other subject, no two resulting
 would be the same.
f t is very probable that one and the same student,
 he required to answer these diﬂerent sets of
  , ‘ens, would receive grades varying as widely as
I  «to"20 per cent. Thus, only by including in the ex-
’ ' tion every point of importance which had been
 ‘ U could the examination be made entirely fair

The wind, blowing through the thin dusk, struck showers or

evergreen needlestotheneadwindingup the mountain-side. Dark-

ness comes rapidly in the mountains, and specks of light appeared

in the valley as an old man rose from the log at the roadside and

looked down. Somewhere, ‘down there in the darkness, was a little
village of huts and shanties. Years and yearsago he had been born
in one of those gambrel-roofed cottages. He had lived there until
his mother had died, and then he had gone away. ‘

In the years that passed people had forgotten the boy. Peer, and
when an old man with gray hair and lined face had walked into the
village inn no one knew him. He had questioned the innkeeper and
the townspeople. Yes, they remembered the widow Ase and her
troubles with the boy, Peer. But Peer had been no good and had sold
his soul to a green troll in the mountains. After he had worried his
old mother to death, he had gone out of the hills into the world. No,
he had never‘ been ‘heard of since. He had probably been killed in a

‘ drunken brawl in some tavern, or somevpainted women ‘had led him

to‘  death. He’d never come to any good end. Solveig, who was
the only one in the village‘ that ever believed Peer’s lies, now lived up
in the mountains three roads past the old mill. She. was old now, but
she had always believed Peer would return.

I The old man had thanked the white-aproned keeper, and tossing
a few ‘coins on a table for another round of beer, had gone out into
the late afternoon. A venerable villager, smoking a cnurchwarden on
the bench before the inn, had watched him go up the road toward
the mountains.

Up in the mountains, the old man was standing before a newcut
pileiof logs on the roadside. On the logs, where he _had been sitting,
lay a black crush hat and a large dusty cape ofiﬁne black cloth. The
breeze from the valley ﬂattened the baggy trousers against the calves
of his legs and billowed out his sweat-stained gray shirt. He pushed
back his gray hair. The deep lines of his face softened and his blue
eyes assumed amusing look. .He stood silent, looking at the spots of
light in the _valley; then, throwing the cape over his shoulders and
pulling the black hat over his eyes, he started up the road. It was
dark now, and the thick trees arching the road were "nothing buttblack
blots. His footsteps thudded on the hard mud of the road and now
and then, as his shoes struck- imbedded boulders, scraping sounds
echoed over the still valley.‘

He swung up the road withﬁrm strides, involuntarily accelerating
his gait in passing through the blackened patches of road and
slowing down when the .~ road widened and the valley below became
visible. Ahead, on the ‘uphill side of the road, stood a building,

gigantic in the darkness. ._Bubbli_ng ‘sounds, as -of water boiling over .
- rocks, reachedthe old man's ears. “The old mill,” he thought, and!

quickened his step. He“ began to sing to keep himself company.
“A sexton! A sexton! where-are you, hounds?‘
A song from braying preccntor-mouths,-
Around your hat brim: a mourning band;—-
My dead are many; I must follow their biersl”

A" dark ﬁgure, carrying a tool box. and a large ladle, came. out
of the darkness.

“Well met, old galfer! Why do you hurry so '.""

The old man stopped, amazed, and greeted the stranger in a voice‘
that was half fear and half bravado. _ I

“Good evening, friend. I go to my own grave-feast.”

“Indeed! My si'ght‘s‘ not soggood‘-—excuse me-—your name doesn't
chance to be Pee_r'!"' Again the old man started. A ’

“It is. Peer Gynt men called me-—when they'knew me.” The
mysterious! stranger chuckled softly. . .

“That's luck--for it is Peer.Gynt' I'm sentfor tonight!”

“Sent f_or‘!_' 1.. . .w_hat can you-want, of me’! V I-1--I am only
Peer Gynt, looking for peace forihis soul.” The other chuckled again,

‘ 2 maliciously, it seemed to Peon

“I am the button moulder. My ladle isjempty and Master has

Stranger. I ‘ t

“But--why——m‘y soul? Would not any other soul do just as
well?” Peer's‘ voice had lost all traces of deﬁance. The pompous-
old liar. was gone foreveri

“All worthless, souls are -made into buttons, Peer Gynt, and I
have come for yours. Come, come, do not bargain with me!”

‘-‘But I amfnot ready. I--I—-I am not yet’ ready! Give me
another-day--another hour, even, and I’ll be ready.”

“I cannot delay.” The button moulder stood silent for a moment,

watching Peer intently. Then his face took on a magnanimous look.”

“Well, -old. man, ,l§’ll. give you respite. Your soul shall "be your-‘
own until we meet at the third cross-road. Farewell, then, until the'—.”
And the mysterious button moulder disappeared into‘ the night; .

Peer stood stock-still, his-mind, a maze of interweaving odds and
ends of thoughts. Then, slowly his, feet began to move forward as
‘if dragged by an unseen hand. He walked woodenly, his arms and
legs moving like those of a puppet. His brain was in .a whirl,
thoughts crowding and pushing each other, tumbling end over _end.
Onward and onward, entirely unconscious of where he was heading,
Peeriwalked slowly, passing two cross-roads that came out ‘of the

dark woods. The moon was out now, and crazy shadows hopscotched

back and forth across the road. Passing around a huge boulder at

abend in the road, Peer saw a light before him. It must be Solveig’s.
home-—and it, was the third cross-road, too! For had they not said‘

in the village the third road past the old mill? His feet moved them-

selves mechanically backward and. forward, and the light came nearer. '

As ‘he approached the little brown cottage with its lighted window and
its ﬂower-beds by the doorway, a ﬁgure stepped out of the shadows
and accosted" him. ‘

“Well, Peer, here" is the third cross-road. Have you prepared
your soul?"

“Why-—I--I don’t know how. It’s been so long since I have

thought of my soul that I had forgotten it existed. It is my soul-—

is there no way it can be saved?”
“Aye, by the mercy of God, there is!”
“Well, tell me quickly!" ‘ , V,
“Go to yonder cottage and ask of Solveig a riddle I’ shall tell you.’f

“The riddle-—quickly, good button moulder, tell me the riddle.”

The buttonmoulder laughed softly at the old man's anxiety.

“Ah, you worry now, do you, old rascal‘! Well, ask of Solveig
if she can tell you where Peer Gynt’s soul has been all these years.”

“And what then?” I

“If she answers satisfactorily, I will give your soul safe-conduct
to the Master and save it from my’ ladle.” Peer shuddered, took a
step forward, then turned back.

“No-I can't!”

Softly, from the cottage, came the humming of a woman’s voice.
It sounded as would muted strings over silent water at dusk. Peer
turned again and started slowly in the direction of the little cottage.
He went silently, without looking back at the button moulder.

“Peer!” the button moulder called, “your worth will be weighed,
now, and you shall hear the judgment."

Peer went on, up to the cottage door, fumbled with the latch
string and pushed the door open. Stepping into the half-lit room,
he looked dazedly about him. A long deal table, with a bowl of mush,
a pewter mug, and a stone crock of milk on it, stood in the center of
the low beamed room. A rough rush-bottomed chair stood at the
table. At one end of the room a crackling wood ﬁre threw a ﬂickering
light over a spinning wheel and an old sea-chest which stood at the
side of the flat stone hearth. In the middle of the hearth a woman in
acoarse brown homespun dress knelt before the blaze, stirring the
contents of a pot in the embers.

At the creak of the door being pushed shut she arose and faced
the newcomer, startled. Neither Peer, staring hard at the woman,
nor the woman staring questioningly at Peer, spoke for a moment.
Their eyes, going over each other’s ﬁgures slowly, took in all. Peer
saw a woman of late middle age, broad-bosomed, in a coarse cloth
dress tied around the waist with a cord, 3. weather-wrinkled face with
kindly eyes framed by thick gray hair that hung in plaits over each
shoulder. The woman took in Peer’s dusty cracked shoes, his baggy
trousers, his long black cloak, his face with its drooping mouth and

weak eyes, and his curly gray hair. Then Peer stepped haltingly

The Elshuco Trio of New York
presented the final concert of the
Art Society of Pittsburgh Friday
evening. The Art Society has
brought some fine artists to Pitts-
burgh in the last few years, but

never any finer than this trio.’

Messrs. Kroll, violin, Willeke, ‘cello,
and Giorni, piano, are all ﬁnished
artists. The ‘versatility, of each,
however, was subdued enough that
a perfect ensemble resulted. At
times the tone of the violin was a
little hard and did not blend with
the ‘mellower ’cello, but never too

‘much to destroy the unity.

Brahms’ Trio  B Major opened

the progran. This work is an early ;

one and sounded much more‘ like '_a
work of oneiof the-romantics than
of Brahms, the neo-classicist. The
chief melodies sounded Schubortian,

and never once were the typical‘

Brahmsian rhythms in evidence.

The second number was new to
Pittsburgh. It was a -group of

Litanies by Paul Juon‘. Fromothe‘ .

first bars of the melodyﬁto the ﬁnal
passages of diminished chords, it

was French. Parts of it show an

entirely modern trend while other

parts of it are as strictly" classical L
as Bach. It was always effective, ‘

both dramatically and musically.

The concert concluded with ‘the
Trio in A Minor of Tschaikovski.

The first two movements of this -

work might have been writtenby a
Frenchman or a Swede as ‘well as
by a Russian, but the melancholy

minors in the third movement iden.- *_

tiﬂed it indubitably as Russian--and-'
Tschaikoivskian. Only the man who
wrote None but 1 the Lonely‘ Heart

4‘ and the Pathetique could have

"written that ﬁnale. Two; encores,
one a movement of a. Brahms Trio“
in C"Minor, were given.

This recital was a fitting climax .
to the Art Society's _s_eason,_and if, i
-one can judge by’ the list of ‘artists -
to appear next year, the Society
will keep up" their banners.» Despite

‘the fact that it may seem a little

previous‘ (I'm always being previous, 1'”
anyhow) "I ‘want to announce some -
of the artists for next: season. It. V
will,-at least, give something to look 
forward. to. The Flonzaley Quartet '
comes for a “ﬂnal" appearance (I.

Pittsburgh. ‘Madame Suggia, whose

_ portrait by/Augustus John won. the

International prize. in 1924, and

Katherine“ Meisle appear together. -

Elizabeth Rethberg, Paul Kochan-.
ski, and Josef Lhevinne are the
others. on the list. A very imposing
group, indeed, and I think the music

lovers of the city owe this society '

a. debt of some kind or other‘.

 

A ASSEMBLY \

I was'one of the few stray indi-'
viduals who strayed into the‘. 
morial Hall last Friday at Assem-
bly hour, and although not greatly
enlightened by the major pottlonof
the program. I feel that I "must
mention some singing I heard.

A Mr. and Mrs. Lacy, Negro
singers, gave us a bit of their iinest
gospel singing I have ever heard
short of the Clef -Choir. Neither

of their voices -were as artistic as .

those of Roland Hayes orPa'ul Robe-

son, but they gave us. something in: "

their singing that is ‘often . misllnz

from the Negro songs of 

more cultured singers. I, for one,
would have liked to have heard a
lot more than I did.

started toward Peerbut dropped
weakly into the: chair before
reaching him. Peer stumbled
forward and buried his head -in
her lap: She ran her-hands over
his shoulders and through his
hair, singing softly,

“My Peer-my boy—my poor
lost Peer.” Peer raised his head
and stared her in the face.

“Aye, lost, unless thou caust
answer me riddles!” She looked
down at Peer with mild eyes
that wrinkled at the corners.

“Riddles—-tell me them!”

“Where--where has my soul-—
where has Peer Gynt’s soul been
all these years? Where was I
with God’s seal on my brow‘!
The woman laughed softly and
brushed» the tangled hair back
from Peer’s anxious eyes.

“Thy soul-—it has been-—
in my faith, in my hope‘, and
in my love.”

Peer dropped his head into
her lap. Seven’ soft knocks,
broke the silence. both man
and woman turned toward the
door. A voice from the out-

side called,
“Thy soul is safe, Peer Gynt,
the woman has answered well." ‘
The voice dimmed as if the
speaker were going

away.

Reynolds to placard disdainfully, “For Pleasure, Smoke
Camels” or words to that sense. When Luckies
boasted its canary qualities with photographs of stage
celebrities, Chesterﬁelds, whose ads have always been
digniﬁed (Recall the “Blow Some My Way” opus), were
goaded ‘into printing a conversation between a name-
lclagentleman in evening dress and one obviously an
opera singer, which blurted to an innocent audience
that cigarette testimonials were no more to be trusted
than those ﬁne letters to" Lydia Pinkham. This news
destroyed our last illusion. It has come to the point
thatmy. oldest boy makes me read him the cigarette
advertisements instead of the funnies.

ADVENTURE

In the thick, especially thick, of Saturday night's
snow, six bold’ souls chartered a cab, of which color,
because of editorial policy forbidding us to advertise,
we’ decline to say, but why end a sentence that way?
The expense was pulling up Shady Avenue hill (adv.),
when one of the chains ‘broke. Because the snow was
everything which the driver named it, the taxi wheels
grabbd not and did spin around right merrily, with
that whining that all Pennsylvania Eskimos know.
And the meter, also, ticked a good tune, wherefore,
forty cents were added to the bill before the cab had
gone one block, and there was weeping, and wailing,

. end guashing of teeth.

EXCHANGE’ DEPARTMENT
HE Iowa Friool madefan invaluable contribution to
 social science by listing every sorority dame at the
university and classifying each one in reference to her
intellect,“ beauty, ﬁnances, physique, line, dancing,
amusements, and necking powers. For example, Alice
Ben-Bolt of Iota Kno Betta was listed as c&kvx%xoe,
which-lmeans that she is a crock for looks, shows no
signs of intellect, owns inexhaustible wealth, wears 9.
Fisher body,‘shoots~ a fast and feverish line, but pre-
fers action, cavorts at a ball with the abandon of an
ocean -liner, prefers. movies to concerts, and necks like
Strangler Lewis. The detail is, necessarily, scanty,
but it is. at least suiilcient to warn the habitual vic-
tims of blind, dates." If some scholar would only do
 same for'Pitt, his fame would be unbroken, which
is more than: we can. say for his neck.,

can be pronounced omcially erudite, we learn that our
time in college has been wasted. The American Mer-
cury prints an advertisement of The Man’: Outline of
Knowledge by Clement Wood that states

Here, -within the covers of a. single volume is
virtually EVERYTHING that the modern man or
woman needs to know about the world we live in
. . . . by simply reading this one interesting book,
you can acquire a clear and colorful picture of
man’s past and present.

SN'T civilization wonderful? We can get cultured,

with 700 pages, almost as quickly as we can get
shaved.

The eminent Pittsburgh Sun-Tele calls the book a
university in itself. We suppose fraternity rushing
comes in the preface and that there are football games
at the end of each chapter. Classes are cut when one
skips a paragraph and Easter vacation is executed with
illustrations. But what is a university without pop
quizzes?

The advertising blurb goes further to say that
the book gives "a bird’s eye-view of all learning." Well,
that is about right.

But, even if birds are dumb, what of it? If they
do not wear Phi Beta Kappa keys, it is because they
do not need them. For our part, we think birds lead
a swell life. They are born without .pain and ma-
ture without the nuisances of, tonsillectomies; wisdom
teeth, puberty, and Sunday school. They ﬁnd plenty
to eat without having to sell neckties or melt steel for
the privilege. Plumbing isthe least of their worries.
Their clothes always ﬁt them and their tailor is one
of the best. Their landlord is lenient. ‘They pay no
taxes and may travel whenever their please, with no
worry about flat tires or passports. They have only
to sing, make love, and play practical jokes on mor-
tals. Who would not be a bird? Probably Senator
Heﬂin.

HE observation is probably‘ unimportant, but the
next freshman who writes an investigative theme
on Jazz might note that some of the earliest, if not
the best, jazz lyrics were written by Aristophanes.

The story is that the Kronkheitunterstutzenverein is
established on_this campus with the idea that its mem-
bers be self-ostracised Greeks. Any member‘ who at-
tends three fraternity meetings in succession is auto-
matically ﬁned a round of beers for the gang and if
he is known, at any time, to indulge in the mystic
grip, he is automatically barred from listening in on
the radio. The ﬁrst function of the Kronlchez'tuntar-
stutzverein occurs tonight at the Davis midnight

Rev. 1'. 2:. Miller s....i. on
“The Expanding Horizon”
At Chapel Services

“God must not only be great, but
must have a ﬁne eye,” Rev. Theo-
dore E. Miller, pastor of the First
Baptist Church, declared in a talk
on “The Expanding Horizon” at
chapel in Heinz house last Wednes-
day. Dr. W. W. D. Series, professor
of secondary education. presided.
“Although the horizon is continu-
ally changing,‘ Salu Rev. Miller, ‘it
is during the college career that we
witness the greatest expansion. The
boy coming to college meets new
friends, different in many ways from
the friends he had been taught to
like at home. These new acquaint-
ances may have higher or lower
ideals than he has. His social hori-
zon is_ broadened. He must learn
what invitations to accept, which to
refuse. He must learn how to use
his leisure time.

“The great amount of space, and
the great amount of time," said the
Rev. Miller, “are the two most
startling facts which confront the
student upon his entrance into col-
lege. The student realizes that these
two factors make up history, a con-
tinuous process of which he is a part,
a part of a“ great army going on and
on toward an ever ex anding hori-
zon. The expansion o the religious
horizon is one of the hardest for the
new student to understand. He must
lear into readjust his religious ideas

edge he learns at school. He must
readjust his idea of God in order to
have Him rule over the great amount
of space with which he has become
acquainted. He must feel the ﬁne
eye of God peering through this
space that separates him from the
ever expanding horizon.”

HEN -the steam shovel suddenly strikes a‘ stratum. of
heavy clay hardpan, or shale. how can explosives be
used to keep the yardage up to schedule? When the excava-
tion is for a foundation how can you use explosives without
weakening the support for the building? In blasting,

A foundations through rock, how should dynamite be used

to avoid cracking the rock beyond a certain line? 
should bore holes be loaded, how placed? - ‘

These and a multitude of other questions that are not"
ordinarily treated in the average engineering text 
but will most certainly arise when you're in the ﬁeld, are‘
completely answered in the Blasters’ Handbook. Each
operation is carefully described and illustrated with dis.-
grams and photographs. This book, new standard, in
many engineering classrooms, is a digest of ﬁeld experi-
ences covering a period of 125 years. There is no other
book like it because no other men ever had so long and so
diverse an experience to draw upon. '

You can have a copy of the Blasters’
Handbook by merely ﬁlling in this 
pan. It costs you nothing.

Navy Secretary Curtis Wilbur
Explains Actions Before»
20th Century Club

_ Emphasizing the fact that train-
ing for the navy must go on in;
peace as well as in war, Curtis D;
,Wi1bur, secretary of the navy, made
an address before the Twentieth
Century Club last Monday, which
might have been-; taken as a pos-
._sible justiﬁcation for ‘the recent ap-
by his depart-‘

 

ment. 1 .-

“Contrary to popular belief,” he
‘said, “ships do not operate by‘ them-
selves, but must be manned by men
who have gone through a vigorous
training in order to be ready for
any 4-emergency.” Mr. _ Wilbur
brought out that, the majority of
these men have come .from high
schools-' and" that a very‘ small per—
centage have college degrees. “It
is agreat task to train these‘ men.
-to better themselves mental1y,'phys-l-
ically, and morally,” said Secretary
Wilbur. ‘ , _

“Great vsums — of money are con-
lsumed,” continued Mr. Wilbur, “in
this house cleaning process in: order,
to~produce~ perfect citizens who will
be ca able of giving’ aid when neces-
sary.’ “Let us stand by the men
in the navy, and not be drawn into.
a disastrous war, since our funda-
mental duty is to provide for the .-
nation’s protection,” concluded Mr.
Wilbur.‘

added. _ I E. A .-_.

The faults of the lawyer who is
just, ’egin_ning.. to‘. practice, were
poin K out by (Justice Kephart, to-
gether with“ cures for these evils.

V e closed his address with a plea
"to the seniors, requesting observ-
ance of these pointswhen they are
ready to begin ‘the practice of law.
“The. legal ‘graveyard is ‘filled with

Aside from the desirable habitof thrift which
it helps you to establish, a bank account gives
you valuable experience in the handling of

An account with the Mellon National Bank
will give you a splendid start.

NA TA Tons. WHO BROUGHT THIRD EASTERN CHAMPIONSHIP To PITT THIS YEAR   

SWIMMERS FINISH  
SEASON UNBEATEN

Natators Are Third Panther
7 Team to Win Eastern
9 Championship

wnrcnr BREAKS RECORD‘

Coach’ Pat J. Corr’s varsity and
freshman natators added to Panther
laurels last Wednesday night at
Treesgool when both aggregations
ﬁnish their scheduled season with
undefeated records. The varsity
splashers swamped Carnegie Tech,
42 to 20, and the froshoutswam the
plebes from Schenley park‘ 49 to 10.

Due of the absence of Bowen and
Lithgow the‘ Panther regulars were
not expected to win by such a de-
cisive margin, but Coach Corr had
his mermen well primed for the bat-
tle and the Pitt tankers had an easy
tirneof it from the initial event.

Cap’t. Bill Wright, former Alle-
ghen ‘High star,‘ ended his career as
a co legiats contender with three
spectacular races. In the 160-yard
relay, Wray of Carnegie was away
with a two-yard lead when Wright
was touched off by the third Pitt
man.~ The Panther speed-demon
quickly overhauled Wray and won
with two yards to spare.

Wright cracked one tank record,
winning the 40-yard free style in
:18 2-5 beating his old mark of :19
-ﬂat. He» threatened another in the
100-yard free style with remarkable
time of :551—5, one-fifth of a sec-
ond from the record set by him
earlier in the season.

Last Monday evening March 12,
1928, the undefeated golden splash-
ers entered the annual P. A. C. meet
at the Natatorium in Pittsburgh.
Stoifan, freshman, won the 60 yard
novice over a ﬁeld of twenty swim-
mers. The Pitt relay team composed
of Wright, Swenson, Jackson and
Woolridge overcame their 13 sec-
onds handicap and laced second
nosing out their riva s at the end.
Mango placed second in the 150 yard
back stroke, losing to Wyatt of
Uniontown, Senior, A. M. A. record
holder of this event. Valentine, frosh
distance swimmer, and winner of the
Senior A. M. A.'500 yard outdoor
and 400 yard indoor championships
last year, lost. a close race in the
220 yard free style event.

Following up their good record
the Panther tankers travelled to the
Senior A. M. A. Championships at the
Mclieesport “Y” tank last Friday
and took everything away but the
water in the pool. Cap’t. Bill Wright
won the 100 yard free style event,
and in accomplishing this achieve-
ment set a new Senior . M.
record of ,:5B 1-5 sec. Mango, su-
preme back stroke artist of this dis-
trict. won the 150 back stroke event
in‘ 1:10 ﬂat. Fred Woolridge, fresh-
man star of the Panthers, placed
second in this event, giving Al
Mango a scare at the ﬁnish. The
only other Pitt man entered was Al
Swenson, frosh frog artist, who
placed fourth in the 100 yard breast
stroke event.

The ﬁnal appearance of the Pan-
ther mermen will be on April 13 and
14, when the University will conduct
the Annual School Championships.
Pat Corr states that Captain Bill
Wright and Albert Mango will
leave next Wednesday night for
Philadelphia where they will com-

te for Pitt in the Intercollegiates

eld_ at the University of Pennsyl-
vama.

SPIKES

Pete Bowen, sprinter, took over
another indoor track record last Fri-
day, breaking the long standing
mark in the quarter-mile which was
held jointly by Shea and Martin at-
55 seconds. The new mark was set
at 54 2-5 seconds.

Vic Pickard, pole vaulter, is‘ get-
ting up higher each day. Last Fri-
day, Vic got over the bar at 12 feet,
six inches with each. This is six
inches higher than he did the week
before, and equals his former indoor
record mark. *.

Rob Roy, middle-distance man,
ran a 4:44 mile on the indoor oval
on Thursday evening. The record for
the track is 4:38 3-5.

>lI II» $4

Captain Gibby Welch, Pitt’s four-
event. man, who set the new indoor

shot put is going after a better
mark. Gibby’s outdoor record for the
shot, set last season, is 43 feet, 111/2
inches. This will give some idea of
what may be expected of Welch in
spring track.
an at

Entry blanks for the Ohio State
relays are in the hands of Coach
Frank Shea, and from now on he
will be watching his men carefully
in order that he will be able to pick
the best men to send to the Ohio
relays. Two of last season’s winners,
Pickard and Gwinn, are sure to
make the trip.

33 * ¥

Others who are trying out for the
trip to Columbus for the relays are:
Wibecan, Bowen, Welch, and mem-
bers of the Pitt mile and two-mile
relay teams. Thos’e capable of mak-
ing the one-mile team are Wibecan,
Bowen, C o m f o r t, McCullough,,
Wherry and Roy.

it it

Last year, a Pitt one-mile team,
composed of Rob Roy, Ken Wibecan,
Jim Wick and Pete Bowen, running
in the order named, won the relay
in a Stadium meet in the fast time
of 3:31. ,Wick has graduated, but

Fifty Frosh Spikers
Drill For Meets

Out of the ﬁfty prospects that
have come out for Fresh track prac-
tice, Coach Shea has been able to
build up a nucleus around which he
hopes to erect a good team. Al-
though he has not, as yet, four men
for each event, he has secured at
least one good man for the back-
bone of each. There seems to be
little doubt but that Coach Shea
will turn out a good team from his
material as it is the most promising
that he has had for years.

WUNDERLICH UNANIMOUSLY

NAMED sAsK§:rsALL_c_APTAIN

New Cage Captain
, Tickled With

1 ' Honor

—---.--—a

“I am tiekled to death, fellows,”
said Captain-elect Jerry Wunderlich
following his election to captain the
1929 basketball team at the banquet
Thursday. .

“I don’t have much to say but I
want to thank the fellows for honor-
énigl me and will do my best next

a .

“We ought to have a good team‘
next year. I wouldn’t just say right
now whether we will win them all
again but I hope so anyhow.

Wunderlich has been playing bas-
ketball for eight years and even
longer. Before he entered Duquesne
high school he played on the Car-
negie Library team at Duquesne.
While a member of that team he
helped establish one of the best rec-
ords ever made by a junior team in
this district. A man by the name
of Mensforth coached the team and
taught Jerry the fundamentals of the
game.

For three years Jerry was a mem-
ber of the Duquesne high basket-
ball and tennis teams, starring in
both lines of sport. His best per-
formance on the court was in the
elimination games in Pittsburgh
which saw his team far up in the
standing.

At Pitt Jerry soon made the
freshman cage and court teams and
played exceptional good ball at the
pivot post on the frosh cage ag-
gregation. In his sophomore year he
made the varsity tennis team and
subbed for Horse Chase at the cen-
ter job in basketball.

The beginning of the past sea-
son found Wunderlich on the bench
but soon after the Western invasion
Carlson realized his powerful defen-
sive tactics and his abilities at the
tip-off job and from then on Jerry
was found at center at the start or
every game. He was recently named
ﬁrst string center on the mythical
all-district ﬂoor team.

In answer to the query of what
one chief factor made for the suc-
cess of the past season Jerry said,
“The cooperation between the play-
ers and the coach and between the
coach and players helped us go
through undefeated. It was a lot of
fun and I sure enjoyed every min-
ute of the season. ‘

“Although the members of the
team were not conﬁned to strict
training rules, the fellows took good
care of themselves. As far as eating
goes, the day of a game we would
eat at the regular meal time as
usual, except that at four o'clock on
game days we usually had a big
meal contrary to the custom of most
cage teams who eat very lightly the
day of the game.

“We will feel the loss of Reed and
Wrobleski and it will be a hard job
to ﬁll their places. Carlson may
move me back to a guard job and
break in a new pivot man but I can-
not say deﬁnitely what Carlson's
plans are.

“A number of promising frosh will
come up from the yearling ranks
and these with what remains from
this year's squad should give us a
good club. The schedule will be
tough and Notre Dame as well as all
the other victims will be laying for
us next year.”

Playing on both the tennis and
basketball teams, Jerry commented
on the. strenuousness of the two
games, “I ﬁnd basketball much more
strenuous, although a fellow has to
be a little faster on his feet and

quicker in swinging his mitts to be
a good tennis player.”

Nine Golden Panthers Are
Awarded Letters At
Annual Banquet ‘ V

Charles Jerry Wunderlich", stellar
center of the Panther quintet, was
chosen to lead the Gold basket-
ball teamnext fall at t e seventh
annual basketball banquet v held
Thursday night in the ballroom of
the Schenley hotel under the aus-
pices of the Pitt Y. M. C. A. Wun-

third and ﬁnal season for the Blue

' The following members of the
varsity squad who were awarded let-
ters elected Wunderlich by a unani-
mous vote: Captain Sykes Reed,
Stanley Wrobleski, Paul Zehfuss,
Charles Wunderlich, Charley Hyatt,
Lester Cohen, Paul Fisher, John T.
McMahon and Chester Sandberg.
Nine members of the freshman
squad were awarded their numerals
including Raymond Anderson, Rob-
ert Stewart, Albert Swanson, Eddie
Jacobs, Milton Cohen, Arthur Kantz,
Fritz Miller, Phillip Aiello and Ed-
ward Baker Butkiewicz.

son undefeated. It was no matter of
luck or accident but simply the ful-
ﬁllment of a pre-determined pur-
pose.” »

He continued, “As to whether we
are national champions I think we
have won that honor and believe we
can rightfully claim it; if we our-
selves are not that proud-of our rec-
ord how can we expect -others to
recognize it? The boys have set up

fellows can do with a little plan-
ning, some conﬁdence, and the de-
termination to succeed.”

Coach Carlson also praised George
Kowallis, freshman coach and star
member of last year’s varsity, for
his fine work with the freshman
team. He made mention of the “pat
on the back” method used by Kowal-
lis with his men which he himself
employed among the varsity players.

Captain Sykes next reviewed the
season giving interesting sidelights
of all the main games. He admitted
that the winning basket of Hyatt’s
against Notre Dame was just an-
other contribution of Dame Luck.

Dr. W. C. Parsons, captain of the
1926 quintet, paid tribute to the na-
tional champions in glowing terms.

Following the -brilliant year of
1927, comes the darker horizon of
1928. June will see the graduation of
ﬁfteen [varsity men, including the
entire backﬁeld, as well as many
line men. Those lost are: Welch,
halfback; Salata, tackle; Booth, full-
back; Wasmuth, tackle;,Cutler, cen-
ter; Roberts, guard; Dernois, end;
Fisher, quarterback; -Fyrch, half-
back; Hagan, halfback; Hoban, half-
back; Kern, tackle; Sargent, end;
Goldberg, center; Seyfert, tackle. _

However, to brighten up the sky
a bit, comes the frosh hope together
with twenty-one varsit men of last
year. The frosh showe up well last
season, and from their midst sprang
these men: Hood, fullback; Walen-
chas, halfback; Williams, halfback;
Lewis, guard; Tully, tackle; Loehr,
end, and Milligan, center, who to-
getheriwith the men from the var-
sity: Guarino, end; Bower, halfback;
Getto, tackle; Doverspike-, guard;

halfback; Uansa, halfback; Faw,
guard; Shaw, center; Marohie,
tackle; Montgomery, guard; Ma-

honey, tackle, will be the bulwark of
the team. V

In the graduation, the Panther
squad lost the entire backﬁeld, two
tackles, and one guard from the ﬁrst
team. The strong reserve force
hopes to ﬁll up the gaps. For the
backﬁeld,‘ it will be hard to ﬁnd an-
other Welch, but Uansa is good, and
so are Williams and Walenchus of

alone as fullback, while Edwards
will be a strong candidate for quar-

having such a man for a basket-l
ball coach. Parsons compared the

 

court team of 1916 which set up a;
remarkable record. He eommentedi
from an alumni standpoint, “We who i
are out of the university are brought
closer to school affairs by such
teams as the one this year. The
name of Pitt has been carried to the.
far West and they are still talking
about the wonder team out there. It
is no mean feat for any team to in-
vade the best Western teams and
knock them off in the manner the
Panther boys did.”

W. Don Harrison delivered his
first public remarks in his new role
as athletic director. He added to the
already overﬂowing praises heaped
upon the members of the team and
told of the enviable reputation the
Panthers set up out in Iowa. Har-
riaon’s younger brother was a mem-
ber of the Iowa team that was sent
down to defeat by the Goldens, and
in a letter to the athletic director
said that the fellows on the Iowa
team were indeed glad that a team
like Pitt’s had to be the one to beat
them.

The climaxing event of the affair
was the election of Wumlerlieh. It

Margaret McClenahan, professor of

Dr. Marion Shepard, medical ad-
visor to women, and Miss MeC‘lena-
lian have instituted a new regime
in the “gym.” The physical educa-
tion department and student health
service compared notes. Finding
that it really was quite a feat for
the feet of freshman to average
more than a “C,” they deemed it ad-
visable to give corrective exercises.
Now the freshman co-eds appear in
full attire for a strenuous work-out,
only to ﬁnd they are to take dainty
feet exercises.

Both Miss McClenahan and Dr.
Shepard are “death” on high heels,
and they attribute most of the
causes for defective feet to this evil.
Dr. Shepard claims “walking in one’s
bare feet is not detrimental to ph s-
ical well-being, providing one wa ks

PITT MEN DEFEAT
OBERLIN DEBATERS

Argue and Win Aﬂirmative

Of Foreign Investment
Question

Pitt won a second debating vic-
tory over Davidson College when C.
John Phillips, Col. '30, and Robert
F. Young, Col. ’28, upholding the af-
firmative of the foreign investment
protection question, won an audience
decision in a debate in the Ambridge
high school, Thursday evening.

“The United States is carrying
out a policy of economic imperialism
in its relations with our Caribbean
neighbors,” contended the Pitt
team. It pointed out speciﬁc in-
stances in which our diplomatic poli-
cies have been guided by Wall Street
bankers who were acting only in
their own interests. The occupation
of Santo Domingo by our marines in
1893 on the pretense that the peo-
ple in charge of the customs depart-
ment were carrying out their work
in a manner contrary to the policy
of the United States, is only one of
a number of incidents, the affirma-
tive pointed out, which show only
too clearly our economic imperial-

m.

“The state of affairs between Nica-
ra-uga and the United States is de-
plorable. Intervention in Nicarauga
was tobe temporary, but it begins to
seem that the U. S. does not intend
to leave,” the Pitt team said. Presi-
dent Diaz of Nicaragua was branded
by/the affirmative team as “a rub-
ber stamp of American imperialism
who is‘ so feeble that he would not
"be able to hold office one day with-

out the support of the American

marines.” Marines, it was said, in
carrying out a foreign policy dic-
tated by Wall
harassed and tortured the natives of
Haiti, whom they were really sup-
posed to be defending. Marines act-
ing under orders of officers, hanged

and stabbed women simply because ‘

it was rumored that these women
were. part of a conspiracyagainst
the United States, it was said. “It is
simply a case of bullying the little
fellow. The United States would not
dare attempt such a policy in its
relations with any but such small
nations as Nicarauga or Haiti,” the
aﬁirmative ‘concluded.

YORK SPEAKS ON
TENN. ILLITERACY

Says Lack of Opportunity
Hinders Mountain
People.

The causes of illiteracy among the
inhabitants of the Tennessee moun-
tains was the subject of a talk by
Sergeant Alvin C. York at an assem-

bly held last Friday in Memorial

Hall.

“The illiteracy of the mountain
people,” said Sergeant York, “is not
due to ignorance, but to the lack of
opportunity offered them to become
educated. Boys and girls are forced
to walk four miles to the bus lines,
that have just recently been in-
stalled, and then driven fourteen
miles in order to receive some learn-
“We are not trying to give them
a cultural education,” said Sergeant
York. “I” “We are merely showing
-them some things about life that
will make living in the mountains
easier.”

its pictures?” Here among neat
rows of paste, jars, érasers, and
stacks of gray paper presides Mr.
Jarrett of the Jarrett Studio, -on
Shady avenue,~and oiIicial- photog-
rapher for the University fine arts
department, ,
All of the ﬁfteen thousand repro-
ductions of ancient paintings ﬁled in
the Fine Arts Library have" been
mounted by Mr. Jarrett. Purchased
largely from the Alinari Company in
Italy, the unmounted photographs
are all shipped‘ to Mr. Jarrett’si of-
ﬁce. When ﬁnished, they are»'cata~
logued and placed in books, some as
large as thetopof a card table. 
Some of the reproductions Mr.

from art journals and books. Inci-
dently, the slides he makes for these
pictures are used by Dr. Clapp in
his illustrated lectures.IJust recently
has Mr. J arret begun making simi-
lar slides of all the mounts in the
library. _ I

The Epidiascope, the camera
which is used in these lectures and
operated by Mr. Jarrett, is the only
one of its kind in the country. On
his trip to Europe this summer, Dr.
Clapp expects to purchase two more
similar ones from Vienna. When in
use this machine makes nojbuzzing
sound. So im ressedp with it_was.Dr.
Paul Sachs, irector of the ﬁne arts

ered the principal address at the
Charter
that he decided to order one imme-
diately for the Harvard department.

At present, most of the slides,
numbering about six thousand, were

pany. Among these are also sixty
colored slides made in Paris.’ In
shipping not one of them was
broken. I
