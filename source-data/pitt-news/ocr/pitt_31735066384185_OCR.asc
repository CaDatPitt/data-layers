4§ I977 The Pill News

The refusal of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno (right) to enter a deal with
rival Pitt cost both Eastern schools a chance to play in the Orange Bowl,
according to a high-placed source. Story, page nine.

Butera Will Fight Tax Increase

By DAN ROSENTHAL

Pill News Staff Writer
The State House minority leader

termed students at last Tuesday’s
rally in Harrisburg “a classic
example of people who are
frustrated with the system” and,
while claiming to share ‘their
frustrations, said he plans to ﬁght
any tax increase to fund Pennsyl-
vania’s four state-related universi-
ties.

Robert Butera, at an organiza-
tional meeting here last Thursday
for supporters of his 1978 Republi-
can gubenatorial campaign, told
The Pitt News taxes have been
matched with the wrong appropria-
tions.

“A tax increase has nothing
whatsoever to do with schools,”
Butera said. “Schools enjoy a high
priority among politicians and
among the public, and they have
been held hostage to force through
the legislature something that has a
low priority. That's a tax.

‘ ‘A tax increase is needed to fund
the lowest priority item and not the
highest, ” Butera continued.

Course Evaluation Expanded

By CHERYL PASTORIUS

Course evaluation surveys ad-
- “ 'stered to students at the end of
each term will be broadened to
include a set of descriptive
questions as to the importance of
labs, lectures and term papers,
according to Josh Baylson, Student
Government Board member on the
advisory board of the Ofﬁce for the
Evaluation of Teaching.

Currently, professors can request
evaluations of their courses. After
seeing the results, they can release
the results to students at their own
discretion.

The 10 descriptive questions
added to the survey “will give
information that will be helpful to
students,” said Dr. Grace Lazovik,

di_ not of the Office of Evaluation

 fgaching.
Undergraduate Academic Review,
which published student evalua-
tions of teaching before my office
existed, and surveys for faculty
members who released results to
students after my office came into
existence,” Lazovik said.

The last Undergraduate Aca-
demic Review was published in
1974. However, the questionnaire
is not a new review, Lazovik said.
_‘;The questionnaire is not an effort

A

.,a‘

‘ ‘These questions will replace the A

to publish student evaluations,”
Lazovik said. “It is an effort to get
descriptive data about courses from
students. This will be a convenient
way to ﬁnd out.”

According to Baylson, distribu-
tion of the questionnaires will be
optional for professors during the
upcoming winter term. The surveys

then will be reevaluated at the end
of the term by the office of
Evaluation and Teaching. e

According to Baylson, the SGB
will push for mandatory release of
questionnaire results by all pro-
fessors who permit the surveys to be
given.

outside . . .

‘‘It’s a complicated issue, so it’s
easy for (Gov.) Milton Shapp to say
we need a tax increase to fund the
schools,” Butera said. “People can
relate to that.

“But those of us who understand
the government and the fraud that’s
being perpetrated have an obliga-
tion to stand up against a tax hike,”
he said.

The GOP leader said if the
legislature is going to “extract”
more money from the people, the
money should go to fund “the
lowest priority items, not the
highest.”

‘ ‘I think we need the tax dollars to
pay off (last year's) deﬁcit, and to
continue to fund an expanding
bureaucracy,” Butera said.

“Politicians ought to own up to
that, and have those items stand on
their own merits,” he said. “Then
we can determine if we should trim
spending, and live within our
means.”

Butera said he asked students

attending the rally to focus their

energies toward changing “this
rotten system” and to demand state
government ﬁnances be handled in
a forthright manner.

“I can’t expect them to do that,
because they have an immediate
problem,” Butera said.

Butera termed the lobby in
Harrisburg “a positive thing,”
despite negative reaction from
some legislators.

“Those kind of events, in the
short range, are very negative; in
the long range they have a very
positive effect,” he said.

Most politicians were upset last
Tuesday, according to Butera, “but
I think the fact that many people
would show an interest, helps the
situation in the long range.”

Butera said he won't cater to
students’ or any other special
interest groups in his upcoming
campaign.

“I try not to categorized, but

rather to appeal to people,” Butera
said.

Merit of Death Penalty
Debated At Pitt Forum

By ROBINL. HAMPTON
The role of capital punishment in
America’s judicial system was the
subject of a two-team debate last
week in the Student Union

, Ballroom.

The debate, sponsored by a
number of Pitt’s student organiza-
tions, advanced wide-ranging views
on whether capital punishment
preserves or hinders justice in this
country.

Robert Colville, Allegheny

County district attorney advocated a ’

“limited death penalty” for certain
types of ﬁrst degree murders,
including the killing of a police
officer, corrections officer or
fireman while performing his duty.
He said all cases should be subject
to appeal.

Objecting to this view was Welsh
White, a Pitt law professor, who
stated our judicial system ‘ ‘selects a
handful of people to face the death
penalty.” He indicated plea
bargaining is unfair, claiming it
enables some defendants to avoid
the penalty. White’s reasoning
follows in line with those persons
who claim the death penalty is
imposed “arbitrarily and capric-
iously.”

Hayes»

attempted

White asked, ‘ ‘Should our society
tolerate such a system?"

Richard Thornburg, former U.S.
Asst. Attorney General, favored the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court's
ruling on capital punishment.
Thornburg supported a “limited
death penalty” as a “real deterrent
capability. ’ ’

“In the case of premeditated
murder the death penalty could be ‘a
deterrent, ” Thornburg said.

He said our criminal justice
system will be more effective as
long as a limited death penalty is
imposed.

Omari Musa, a 1967 Socialist
Workers Party candidate for the
U.S. Senate in California and
columnist for the “Militant”
newspaper, advocated abolishment
of the death penalty, saying social
and economic factors are linked to
murder and crime.

He pointed out that of four
hundred persons now on death row,
“S0 percent of those are black and
all are poor.”

He maintained the death penalty
does not deter crime, but is a ploy of
the affluent who take advantage of

' the system.

Faculty Evaluations

Since the Undergraduate Academic Review ceased to be
published in 1974, there has been much discussion as to how an
evaluation system might be designed that would be fair to faculty
and students alike. V

The Office for the Evaluation of Teaching’s recent decision to
expand the present system, adding ten descriptive questions to the
survey now in use, is a step in the right direction. The infqrmation
gathered on the usefulness of labs, papers, etc., will aid the faculty
in curriculum planning. Unfortunately, however, the new
procedure does nothing to alleviate the most glaring deficiency in
the present system. ‘

As long as individual professors maintain control over whether
they are evaluated, and as long as they control the dissemination of
survey results, the evaluations are useless as an aid to students in
course selection. ‘

Professors are justifiably concerned that the evaluation system
be fair to them. Although student evaluations should hardly be the
sole criterion upon which instructors are judged, a bad review by an
unfair or unqualified group of students could go a long way toward
ruining an instructor’s career. But if professors are interested in
fairness, it hardly seems consistent for them to retain control over
the publication of evaluation results.

According to Student Government Board member Josh Baylson,
the SGB will push for mandatory release of questionnaire results in
the future. We support the idea, but we think the Board should
push for more. .

A student-based evaluation system should be instituted, in-
dependent of professors but administered by a responsible Univer-
sity group. All professors should be evaluated and all results
should be made available to students. Keeping a correctly designed
evaluation system under the auspices of the University would help
avoid bias and unfairness toward professors and would avoid the
problems of an unofficial review. Making the survey mandatory,
with the results available to students, would make the whole effort
worthwhile.

lawfully theirs. What took place in
Harrisburg indicates students will
act when their administration has
failed, when their elected officials
have failed and when passive
reasoning and restraint have failed.

Granted, apathy is still wide-
spread on this campus, but we
haven’t been hit quite as hard as
Temple. It was their students who
were the most heated and vocal,
leading the cheers and chants with
the most enthusiasm. Having gone
through the process of letter
writing, telephoning and threaten-
ing to pledge votes elsewhere with
no result,‘ what other alternative
exists but to gather in force and tell
the legislators what they, the
students and the campus commun-
ity, want and need, from yards away
instead of hundreds of miles.

The chanting of “We’ll remem-
ber in November,” “Give us the
loot or we’ll give you the boot” and
“Shape up or Shapp out” may have
amused the attendent officials. If
that was the case, let them call a
bluff. But come November, we’ll
see! Shapp may be leaving, but it

doesn’t have to be with a clear
record of accomplishments only._

Whatever the outcome, we’ll 
be affected, though, as will our

brothers and sisters applying to Pitt
in the years to come. Temple may
have become the vanguard by force,
but we have to do our part if there is
to be any positive outcome. All it
takes is about 15 minutes to register
and vote in the elections and be
counted in that most important
tally. Remember back in the 1960’s

when we were told the only way to 4

change the system was to work from
within, without violence or confron-
tation, and the most effective place
was at the voting polls? Well, as of
now, the system had better be

changed or the next time dig’

Legislature needs a victim to sap,

The initial steps have been taken,
but can we prove the student
population is indeed a sleeping

needed? Or will we?

i . Reflections on the Harrisburg Scene

By LEONARD ROMBERG

Watching what goes on in
Harrisburg reminds me of the antics
in the opening of the musical play
“1776.” The Congress debates
forever, constantly votes on mean-
ingless resolutions and resolves
nothing.

Though the Senate’s passage of a
tax plan to fundthe universities is a
welcome relief for all who are at the
mercy of rising tuition rates,
everything leading up to that plan

and the plan itself is not much less

than a debacle.

Politics have led to one mistake
after another; the ﬁrst appeared last
summer. The budget as passed
three months ago was nothing more
than a cop~out, making the so called
non-preferreds look like the culprits
for any horrors to follow. Clearly,
this is not so, for the committment
to fund those institutions dates back
many years, and it was known they
had to be funded.‘

Politics led to the delay—a tax

but ironically, the more the
legislators drag their feet on the
issue, the more it will hurt them as
the 1978 election inches closer. v

And so it went. Welfare people
screamed when the checks stopped
appearing, the Senate was split too
many ways, the legislators
panicked, and then produced an
incomplete budget that left the
universities in the cold. For some
reason, the lawmakers thought the
crisis would be easily resolved in
September.

We all know better now. No one
really was worried when school
began; everyone was assured the
problem would be settled soon and
that no genuine problems would
occur.

Letting time pass without resolv-
ing anything was the second
mistake. The scene was clear—with
the general appropriation already
passed, using all available funds, a
tax increase was necessary to fund
the schools. But too many people
were against any taxes for several
reasons—and some were good
ones.

The Republicans feared a tax
(especially corporate) would ruin
the state's businesses, especially
the small ones, which are already

~..I

strapped with a myriad of problems.

Their case is a justiﬁable one;
keeping business in Pennsylvania
makes obvious good sense. Most
Democrats supported an increase in
corporate taxes, but the emphasis

was on a three-tenths of a percent a

personal income tax hike, an
unpopular move politically.

The Republicans would have
loved to show their constituency no
tax hike, ensuring GOP political
gains next year. Unfortunately,
politics won, and the same people
who claim to be the champions of
business stabbed business in the
back, despite their anti-tax bloc
vote. ‘

Conservative stubbornness from
both parties on earlier tax proposals
led to the Senate’s slapping
businesses with a one and a half
percent increase, an unbelievable
burden for a select group of people.

Despite popular belief, a cor-
porate tax hike is worse than a
personal income tax increase
because it hurts small enterprise,
and chases away a vital part of the
economy. Thus, jobs are lost, and
the state loses more than it would
have through a personal income tax
increase.

e‘

The third mistake now hasbéﬂ

made, and it comes at atime when it
must be accepted passively by the
House, due to the crunch on Pitt,
Temple and Penn State.

The legislators’ lack of foresight
backed them into a corner; this
resulted in -unwise legislation,
beginning with last summer's
insane solution. Pennsylvanians
will have to pay the price, and bite
the bullet. But perhaps the voters
will let the politicians pay the '
in 1978, assuming no qu'
miracles.

Flaherty Weighs Entry

PITTSBURGH (AP)—Former
Pittsburgh Mayor Peter Flaherty
has conﬁrmed he’s interested in the
Democratic gubernatorial nomina-
tion but says he hasn’t yet decided if
he’ll run.

“I’m~giving it a lot of thought,”
Flaherty said during a weekend visit
here.

“I’m taking soundings both east
and west," said Flaherty, whose
possible candidacy had been the
subject of speculation last week.

Flaherty, appointed assistant

3 ’U.S. attorney general in April, said
““" i he has twice talked with former U.S.

Rep. William Green of Philadelphia
“on the general overall situation,”
but had not formally invited Green
to team up with him as the
candidate for lieutenant governor.

‘ ‘You do talk to your friends in the
east, and Bill would make a fine
running mate for anybody,” he
added in an interview reported by
the Pittsburgh Press in its Sunday
editions.

Flaherty, who lost a bid for the
U.S. Senate in 1974, said he has not
discussed his interest in the state
office with Attorney General Griffin
Bell, but has alerted other Carter

__cI-“administration officials.

The Washington Post Saturday
quoted officials close to Flaherty as
saying he had decided to run, but he
insisted here that he has not yet
reached a decision.

“I’d like to see who’s in the ﬁeld
first,” he said.

Other Democratic gubernatorial
prospects are former State Auditor
General Robert P. Casey, Lt. Gov.
Ernest Kline and state Auditor
General Al Benedict. The ﬁling
deadline is March 14.

By telephone from Philadelphia
Green was nonoommittal on the
possibility of being Flaherty’s

.Q\;1:unning mate, the Press said.

He admitted, however, he also
has met with Casey, who is
expected to declare his candidacy
for the nomination soon.

‘Pinto Pa. Governor Race

Casey is believed to be trying to
recruit Green for his slate.

“I’ve talked to Pete and Bob and
others, too, but I have no statement
at this time,” said Green, who is
now an attorney in private practice.

‘‘I’d like to see a good Democratic
ticket, but right now I’m enjoying
my new life.”

Flaherty dismissed assumptions
that he might want to leave the
Justice Department because he and
Bell disagree over Flaherty’s
proposal to appoint Federal judges
and U.S. attorneys strictly on merit
and remove them from the
patronage system.

He said he considers his job a
challenge, “but when you’re
working with the Federal bureau-
cracy in Washington, it’s quite
different from working in a state
with people you know.”

Va. Prohibits Bllly’s Beer

NORFOLK, Va. AP—The
Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control
Commission says it doesn’t care
whether he’s the president’s
brother, “Billy’s Beer” can’t be
sold in Virginia.

Billy Carter has a financial
arrangement with Falls City
Brewing Co. of Louisville, Ky.,
which brews and markets the beer.
The cans carry a picture of the
president’s beer-drinking brother
from Plains, Ga.

And that’s the problem. The
commission has a regulation
banning the sale of alcoholic
beverages that carry any endorse-
ment of any famous person on the
label.

A brewery executive said he
hoped the state officials will relax
the policy in this case. Billy Carter
was unavailable for comment
Saturday.

specialty, the “fast-fried” ham-
burger. We began our meal with an
apertif of lemonade (35 cents) in a
slightly-chilled dixie cup. Our
counter girl-hostess, Eileen, sug-
gested we sample the onion rings
(45 cents), fresh from the deep-fry
oil bin. The crunchy outer coating
was hot and crisp, a delight to the
palate, but inside was a limp,
tasteless, greasy ring of onion bits
that could have been improved with
a dash or two of salt.

Next came the main course. The
“Big Box,” a triple-decker ham-
burger (75 cents), was indeed a
culinary masterpiece. Stacks of
prepressed meat (we were assured
that at least 65 percent of it was
beef), mayonnaise and slivers of
tomato and lettuce, all covered with
BB’s well-known “Mystery
Sauce,” were sandwiched by a
sesame-seed bun not unlike those
found at McDonalds. We would
have preferred a bottled root beer
with our meal; since this was

- unavailable, we settled for a slightly
drier, but nonetheless agreeable .

An order of french fries proved to
be a poor choice for 45 cents; the
kitchen was having problems with
the oil temperature that evening,
and our fries were delivered
half-cooked. No amount of Heinz
Ketchup could compensate for the
taste of this failure.

‘I Want To Live’ -- No Change For Denver 

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pi“ News SI)” Writer
I wait To Live
John Denver
RCA

About 20 years ago. there was a
B-grade ﬁlm called “I Want To
Live,” redeemed solely by a great
performance by Susan Hayward.
Now, there is a B-grade album call
“I Want To Live,” which unfor-
tunately is not saved by the vocal
talents of John Denver.

The problem with most singers is
their inconsistency. Denver, on the
other hand, is too consistent, too
predictable. The quality doesn’t
go down—it just becomes overused
and boring. Denver has made no
radical changes in his style since
“Farewell Andromeda” was
released in 1973.

You can reliably bet a Denver
album will contain one song about
the rigors of the road, one song
about longing for home, and that
the rest of the selections will sing
the praises of the Rocky Moun-
tains.

It’s nice that Denver can still get
a Rocky Mountain high from the
sunshine on his shoulder, but it
would be better still if he could ﬁnd
something new to write about.
Not only do most of his melodies
sound the same, so does the poetry.

Denver’s biggest departure from
his usual domain in “I Want To
Live” is in the title song in which
he sings of the unspoiled pleasures
of Alaska. The lyrics, though, are
similar to almost every other song
he’s ever written: “I Want To
Live, I want to grow, I want to live,
I want to know.” Not exactly the
most intellectual of musings to
listen to. And if you substitute
“Rocky Mountains” every time
Denver sings “Alaska,” you’d
swear you heard this song on the
“Poems, Prayers, and Promises”
album. ’

“How Can I Leave You Again” is
all right but, wiht some minor
musical changes, it is actually

“Goodbye Again,” from an earlier
album.
“Singing Skies and Dancing

Waters, ’ ’ another Denver com-
position, has a nice ﬂow. Since
Denver taped a special with

Jacques Cousteau a few years
back, each of his albums has
contained a song about the sea.
“Singing Skies” is a better song
than “Calypso” (in which Denver’s
voice whined so badly, he sounded
like a combination of the west wind
and a sick killer whale). But with
his continuous listing of different
forms of sea life, he comes off like
an encyclopedia.

You could nitpick your whole way
through “I Want To Live,”
pointing out where Denver has
used these songs before, but there
are a few high points in the release.

While Denver wrote over half the ‘

songs, he picked a few winners
from other composers, which vary
the album. I

“Bet on-the Blues,” by Tom
Paxton, is probably the best cut on
the album. Denver’s voice gets a

better workout than it’s had in’

years, and over different territory
for once.

“Dearest Esmeralda” also
succeeds, despite its awful title.
Written by Bill Danoff (of the
Starland Vocal Band and a frequent
Denver contributor), it’s a good
change of pace for Denver and still
in his normal range.

“Thirsty Boots,” By Eric Snder-
sen, and “Ripplin’ Waters,” by
Jimmy Ibbotsen, are not remark-
able, but they are a bit better than
Denver’s own songs.

This is not to say that Denver is a
poor singer—he’s not. It’s just that
he sings for a limited audience that
is becoming more limited by his
song selections. Nothing on “I
Want To Live” is terrible but
nothing is superior.

“I Want To Live” is a pleasant
album, geared for easy listening.
And it’s typical John Denver. Too
typical.

 Pecirson Exhibit Seduces

The exhibition, running to Dec.
18, is entitled “John Pearson:
Color and Systems.” It shows a
varying progression in how Pear-
son has developed his method for
systemic work. He uses pencil,
acrylics and silkscreen in '-the
process.

Systemic art is, very simply, the
idea of art as system. Pearson
works with the assumption there
are no bad colors, only poor uses of
color. To work through this
assumption, he designs mathema-
tical models with numbers repre-
senting colors and grids turned in
varying degrees. He has taken
away the elementof decision or
choice from the artist and made it
into a mathematical construct,
which some people have likened to
taking the spontaneity out of life.

It is all very systematic and
methodical, but the resulting colors
and shapes are neither predictable
nor expected.

This is evident in Pearson’s
“Mondrian Series” that consti-
tutes the main portion of the show.
He restricts his colors to the ones
used by Mondrian—red, blue,
yellow,-black, white and gray. he
allows the viewer to make certain
assumptions about these colors,
then breaks down the assumptions
by the systematic application of the
colors themselves in a grid-like
form. The use of the grid is integral
to this concept. With its open
spaces, the grid converts the colors
to other. different hues outside of
the “Mondrian scale,” while still
maintaining their intrinsic quali-
ties, in itself an exciting discovery.
Shapes change, too, with the
straight lines of the grid angled
toward each other, forming circles
within -circles as in the “Mondrian
Linear Series B,” a series of ﬁve
SlikSL"'-‘(ﬁned panels, having basi-
cally V -. same contructs with the
elemcms of color changed slightly
ll‘:  one. ,

o of the more successful of
Pearson's works is “Mondrian

Area Series: W/G,” where the
artist introduces another sequenc
of grid angles that produce
shadows of the shapes themselves.
Still using the colors of Mondrian,
here Pearson has evolved, through
the overlapping structure of the
grid, unexpected and exciting
colors outside the realm of most of
his other works.

Another interesting piece is
“Mondrian Linear Density, 197S.”
The grids are angled, producing
circles and adding a different
dimension to the lines themselves.

Pearson has several works in the
show that chart the actual
mathematical system he uses in

It’s off to Jacksonville as the
ninth-ranked Pitt football team
ofﬁcially accepted a Gator Bowl bid
Saturday, marking the fourth time
in the last ﬁve years the Panthers
have been invited to participate in
post-season play.

Fifteenth-ranked Clemson,
which ended its regular season at
8-2-1, also accepted an invitation to
Florida’s 33rd annual classic, and
will battle coach Jackie Sherrill’s
Panthers before a nationally
televised (ABC) audience on

t 40

The announcement of Pitt’s
acceptance came at the home of
Pitt Athletic Director Cas Myslinski
shortly after 6 p.m., when a Gator
ofﬁcial extended the invitation to
Chancellor Posvar, who immedi-
ately accepted.

“We ofﬁcially accept the invita-
tion and are very honored to
participate in this year’s Gator
Bowl,” Posvar said.

George R. Olsen, executive vice
president and general manager of
the Gator Bowl Association, was on
hand to personally extend the
invitation, and on work of Pitt’s

acceptance said the Gator Bowl
people “are tickled to death.”

Olsen also said the Gator Bowl
committee ‘ felt it snatched the
nation's best team in the Panthers,
who are riding a nine-game
unbeaten streak and who will take
their 8-1-1 record into the season
ﬁnale against Penn State at Pitt
Stadium Saturday.

“We think you have the ﬁnest
team in the country,” Olsen told
Posvar, Myslinski and Sherrill. “If
(quarterback) Matt Cavanaugh
would not have gotten hurt at the
beginning of the year, we feel Pitt

would be ‘undefeated and ranked
number one in the nation.

“You may not be undefeated or
hold that spot in the rankings, but
you're still number one with the
Gator Bowl committee.”

In a mad scramble to ﬁll open
bowl positions Saturday, Pitt was
the ﬁrst to accept a bid, doing so
only minutes after 6 p.m., the time
at which invitations could be
ofﬁcially extended.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of
the night was the Orange Bowl
committee’s decision to bypass
_Penn State and give Arkansas a

shot at the Big Eight champion
Jan. 2. The Lions are now headed
for Tempe, Ariz., and the Fiesta
Bowl Christmas Day. '

This season's bowl berth marks
the Panthers’ 10th bowl appear-
ance and their second in the Gator
Bowl, where they‘ lost to Georgia
Tech, 21-14, in 1956. Clemson,
whose last bowl appearance was in
the 1959 Astro-Bluebonnett Bowl,
last participated in the Gator Bowl
in 1952, losing_ to Miami (Fla.),
14-0.

Clemson and Pitt each will
receive $350,000 for their efforts.

PSU Cuts Off Its Own Nose in Bowl Scramble

How is it that Pitt, a fine team and one of the most
attractive independents in the country, will be in
Jacksonville Dec. 30, playing Clemson while wishing
it were a bit farther south preparing to play in a
major bowl that, according to Pitt coach Jackie
Sherrill, offers $20 million in prestige?

And how is it that Penn State, another fine team
that until Saturday was sure it would be the recipient
of that prestige, will spend Christmas Day in the
place called Tempe, Ariz., perhaps playing Colorado
State and certainly wondering how in the hell it got
there?

The answer to these questions, according to a
highly-placed Eastern football source whose pre-
deadline bowl forecast proved to be correct Saturday
evening, is in State College, where Penn State’s
animosity toward Pitt prevented each team from get:
ting a chance to play in the Orange Bowl.

The story goes something like this:

The Orange Bowl decided it would consider three
teams, in this order: Notre Dame, the Pitt-Penn
State winner and Arkansas.

The Orange held slim hopes it could pry Notre
Dame from the Cotton Bowl, but resigned itself to
the fact it would have to take the Pitt-Penn State

_ winner, a team attractive in the polls and on the TV

L screens across the country.

Pitt and ABC, which last year combined togive the
Orange its memorable Colorado-Ohio State game,
had again put the screws to the Orange Bowl commit-
tee by moving the Pitt-Penn State game to November
26, one week after the bowls could extend bids.

The Orange selection committee, however, held no
grudge—“The animosity (toward Pitt) left with
Majors,” one Orange Bowl source said—and offered
Pitt and Penn State the chance to have the Nov. 26
survivor come to Miami.

The Liberty Bowl was secured as the loser’s

backup bowl.

Pitt agreed. That was easy, since it was the Pan-
thers’ only shot at a major bowl bid.

Then the Orange Bowl asked Sherrill to see
whether Joe Paterno and Penn State would enter the

E’ *' agreement. Sherrill, without naming thetOrange, has
said he was asked by a bowl to work out an

agreement with Penn State. That bowl had to be the
Orange——can you see Pitt and Penn~State playing for
a Bluebonnet bid?

But Sherrill said he never called Paterno. “I had
nothing to offer,” he said. That, in the end, is where
Sherrill was wrong. He would have been able to of-

fer the only chance either Eastern team had for a
major bowl bid.

So the Orange Bowl, understanding Sherrill’s
position, obligingly made the call to Pa_teLnp itself.

  

     

ut he wouldnt go for if, said OTB‘ Eastern
football official. “Here the Liberty Bowl was
waiting for four days, ready to take the loser, but
Paterno said ‘No deal.’ He wouldn’t deal if Pitt was
involved.

“He threatened to take his team to the Sugar

Bowl. He said, ‘If you want Pittsburgh, take
Pittsburgh, but if you want Penn State you’ll have to
take us without any deals or we go to the Sugar."' '

Paterno’s threat sounds silly to those who have
known for two weeks that the Sugar would take the
Big 10 rurinerup, but it was not so amusing to the
Orange committee, one of whose members Thursday
night asked a Pittsburgh reporter, “Is the Big 10
79011)’ going to the Sugar. For sure?”

But Paterno-——who may have been acting under in-
structions from his athletic department
superiors—wasn’t opposed to any deal; only to one
that involved Pitt. Sensing the Orange’s desire‘not to
pick Penn State on the 19th and watch in horror as
Pitt destroyed the Lions on the 26th, Paterno agreed
to a deal with Arkansas. The Orange would choose
either the Lions or Razorbacks; the other school
would accept a Fiesta Bowl bid.

Arkansas, which mounted a lobbying effort from
which the state-related universities could learn a great
deal, showed its willingness to go through with the
deal by announcing it would go to the -Fiesta if the
Orange took another team.

Paterno, still confident he was the Orange’s
favorite, said nothing. -

The Orange notified Pitt Friday the Panthers were
out of it. The Orange Bowl didn’t send a represen-
tative to Pittsburgh Saturday, as it earlier had said it
would do; Pitt accepted a Gator Bowl invitation at
6:01 Saturday evening, more than an hour before the
Orange made its decision public.

A divided Orange Bowl committee also didn’t send
a man to State College. An Orange Bowl represen-
tative later said it would have been “a waste of
money.”

And so the Orange Bowl called Arkansas coach
Lou Holtz shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday and told
him his players would have a great time in Miami.
And Penn State, which earlier had treated Fiesta
Bowl folks like warmed-over.beans, embraced its
new friends and took the only bid available to the
Lions.

And while a diplomatic Jackie Sherrill was publicly
explaining how he would have preferred seeing Penn
State get the bid, he was privately savoring the fact
Patcino, with whom Sherrill has fought in the
recruiting trenches, had, in an attempt to spite Pitt,
banished himself to Sun Devil Stadium, where Penn.
State will spend Christmas Day still trying to unwrap
the string of events that sent an attractive team like
the Lions to a place like Tempe.

lcers outclassed By Redskins in Double Loss



   

ByJIMPANE

Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pitt Hockey Club locked
horns with true class over the
weekend and lost a two-game
series with Miami of Ohio, 15-2 and
6-5, in Oxford, Ohio.

When head coach Len Barcalow,
who was unable to make the trip
because of job obligations, found
out about his team’s plight, he
asked acting coach Bob Klemz a
simple question. .

“When I talked to Klemzy, ‘I
asked him if the guys went out on

“-tthe ice in their bare feet, or what
 were they doing?” Barcalow said.

“But really, I can't blame Bob.
We’ve been together in hockey for a
long time now, and he knows what
he’s doing."

Klemz said the whole thing could
be explained in terms of caliber.

“Everything is done in ﬁrst class
over there,” he offered. “From
having a rink on campus, to drawing
2,000 fans for each game, to having
two hours of practice time a day,
those guys really have it.

“When I talked with their coach
and told him we only can practice an
hour and a half a week, he couldn’t
believe it. In that respect, we did all
right ”

The Panthers were at a disadvan-
tage before they even got off the bus
Friday. The defensive corps was
equipped with only four skaters,
and goalie Larry Newell was unable
to make the trip. Miami capitalized

on Pitt’s defensive sieve, and
peppered the Panthers with 53
shots in the ﬁrst game.

The Redskins skated circles
around Pitt in the ﬁrst period, and
though the Panthers were able to
stay close at the onset, Miami took a
5-1 lead into the second period.

The second frame was the best for
Pitt, who gave up only a pair of
goals. With the game way out of
reach, Klemz sent in backup goalie
Tom Slivka to replace Rich
Cunningham, who registered his
second poor showing in as many
tries in the Panther cage.

Pitt’s Dave Elson regisfered a

third-period goal that, along with
Bob Stejn’s tally in the ﬁrst period.

were the only scores of the day for
the Panthers.

“They lacked cohesion as a
team,’ Klemz said of his skaters.
“The semnd game was a different
story, though. The guys had atalk
before the second game, and they
found themselves and put it all
together for a great effort.” ’

Pitt realized it could skate with
the Redskins, a club sport that is
planning to go varsity next year.
The battered and bruised Panthers
deadlocked Miami until the ﬁnal 41
seconds of the game, and gave up a
goal by Gary DeLong that sealed
their cofﬁn, 6-5.

In a game that was marred by
penalties—25 in all—Klemz had a
hard time ﬁnding fresh legs. .

“l was looking around ‘for

substitutes, and tney were all in the
penalty box,” Klemz said.
Despite the many penalties and
the hard hitting throughout the
contest, only one ﬁght erupted. A
confrontation that started in the
ﬁrst period between Pitt’s Gary
Gries and Redskin Tom Maletic
ﬁnally broke into a ﬁght late in the
game, when Maletic spit in Fries’s
face. Fries dropped his gloves and
pummeled his agitator into the ice.
“The guy just expectorated in
Fries’ face,” Barcalow said. “I
can't believe it. I don’t know if
that’s a disease that came down
from Carnegie-Mellon or what.”
The game turned into a ﬁght,
goals by Larry Gallick, Elson (2),
Hetz and Gedeon weren’t enough.
and the Panthers’ record fell to 1-3.

Steelers Blast Cowboys, 28-13  

PI'I'I'SBURGH(AP)——Fullback
Franco‘ Harris rushed for a
career-high 179 yards and two
touchdowns, one on a 61-yard
oﬁ-tackle breakaway, to lead the
Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-13
victory Sunday over the Dallas
Cowboys in a National Football
League Game.

The victory, also marked by two
touchdown passes by Steeler
quarterback Terry Bradshaw, kept
Pittsburgh, 6-4, tied with Cleveland
atop the American Conference
Central Division.

Dallas, which lost its second
straight after eight consecutive
victories, had its National
Conference East lead trimmed to
one game over St.‘ Louis.

The defeat also spoiled the
homecoming and ﬁrst NFL start for
rookie Tony Dorsett, who rushed for
73 yards on 17 tries, in his first game
here since he led Pitt to the national
collegiate title a season ago. ,

Harris, who piled up his rushing
yardage on 29 carries, lost a fumble
at his 37-yard line late in the first
quarter. Dorsett followed with a
13-yard touchdown run that gave
Dallas a 6-0 lead after the
extra-point kick was blocked.

On the first play of the second
quarter, Harris took a handoff from
Bradshaw, cut oﬁ’ left tackle,
stepped away from a shoestring
tackle try by Ed “Too Tall” Jones,
and "raced untouched to the end
zone on his 61-yard scoring play.

“It’s a brand rmldav. We’re

going after it now,” the Steeler
fullback said, after be rushed for a
career-high of 179 yards and scored
two touchdowns, one on a 61-yard
off-tackle breakaway.

“We played with a lot more
aggressiveness and a lot more
emotion than we’ve probably
played with in a long time. We
played like champions,” Harris
added.

With 5:26 left before halftime, ‘

Roger Staubach gave Dallas a 13-7
lead with a 23-yard touchdown pass
to tight end Jay Saldi. I

But Bradshaw gave Pittsburgh a
14-13 lead 2:50 before halftime,
with a 9-yard scoring pass to Lynn
Swann.

In the third quarter, Pittsburgh
drove 62 yards for the touchdown
that came on Bradshaw’s 28-yard

, pass over the middle to Stallworth.

The drive included a 17-yard run by
Harris.

“If we continue to play with lots
of emotion, lots of defense and lots
of desire, we won’t lose,”
Bradshaw proclaimed.

Tony Dorsett had one touchdown
and one fat lip to show Sunday for
his homecoming and first National
Football League start.

“I don’t think I have anything
particularly to be happy about, ’ ’ the
Dallas Cowboy rookie said after a
28-13 loss to the Pittsburgh
Steelers. ,

Dorsett, a running sensation at
nearby Hopewell High School and
the Universitv of Pittsburgh,

LLLLLLLLLLL

personally purchased 95 tickets at
$9.15 each for friends and relatives.
And he got a warm ovation before
the game from all the paying
customers at Three Rivers Stadium.

“I didn’t feel any pressure. I’ve
been in pressure situations
before,” said Dorsett.

Late in the first quarter, Dorsett
slanted off the right side on a
13-yard touchdown run that gave
Dallas a short-lived lead.

“We had a few missed assign-
ments,” Steeler rookie middle
linebacker Dennis “Dirt” Winston
said of the touchdown.

“But it was no problem. We
corrected it at halftime and got it
together,” added Winston, who
started in place of injured Jack
Lambert.

Dorsett, who rushed for 41 yards
in the opening quarter, had just 32
the rest of the way. He got his fat lip
in the third quarter, when he was
blocked by Winston near the goal
line after a pass interception.

“Dirt Winston got me,” “said
Dorsett, surrounded by reporters.

“Dirt is just as physical as any
linebacker we’ve faced.” Winston
broke into a big smile at his locker
stall when asked about the block on
Dorsett.

“Oh man, Iwas looking for that,”
said Winston.

‘ ‘I guess he thought he was going
to overpower me, but it looked like it
came out a little different,” added
Winston, whose block ﬂattened
Dorsett and knocked his helmet off.

So after all the brouhaha surrounding the g

Pitt emerged the final victor.

nouncement from the Orange Bowl commit-

: was that ABC would have been foolish not

tee spoiled those plans, however, and
Arkansas will be taking Penn State’s place in
the sun——a decision that left the Lions, well,

in the Fiesta Bowl. That, along with the
Panthers’ placement in the Gator Bowl, gave
Pitt the finest bowl berth of any Eastern
team.

So Pitt will participate in a more
prestigeous post-season event ‘than Penn
State—a turn of events that produced a rare
smile on the face of Pitt Athletic Director
Cas Myslinski at his cocktail party for the
media Saturday night. Pitt people are happy
and are in the best position they had a shot
at-—or are they?

The Gator Bowl announcement was
mildly pleasant, but it’s hard not to think the
Panthers aren’t deserving of a better in-
vitation. Though many believe Pitt is much
better than even the two blemishes on its
record might suggest (a loss and a tie), it is
usually the record bowl committees fall back
on in times of indecision.

Even though ‘Pitt head coach Jackie
Sherrill has done a formidable job in his first
year at the helm, it would be easy to criticize
Johnny Major’s replacement for the two
Panther lapses. Sherrill had alternatives in
both of those games that could have even-
tually resulted in a current 10-0 maark. But

then, ‘you can't expect a team to go un-
defeated two straight years.

Maybe a bigger finger could be pointed at
the entire athletic department. The decision
to push the Pitt-Penn "State encounter back a
week not only peeves a good many Pitt
students who will be unable to attend the
Thanksgiving weekend game, but also
thwarted Pitt’s chances at a major bowl. If
the game would have been played Saturday

the Orange bid hands down.

persuasion by ABC, though, and
$250,000 and a national television appear-
Maybe what Pitt failed to consider

to televise that game no matter when it were

played, and a berth in the Orange Bowl
would have resulted in an extra million to
pay the bills. In the end, Pitt has substituted
one million dollars and the Orange Bowl
plus the $250,000 and ABC for the network
money they were getting anyway and
$350,000 for a Gator Bowl showing.

Though it seems like Pitt only harmed it-
self, the true culprit in this entire mess is the
NCAA and its post-season matchup policy.
The mad rush to fill bowl vacancies before
the regular season officially ends is
ridiculous. Logically, it would be a much
saner situation if bowl committees waited
until the final seconds of the final collegiate
game ticked off the clock before extending
bowl bids, which would only be a week later
than when—tTtey are issued now. The deserv-
ing teams (like this year’s Pitt squad) would

enter the spotlight and the post-season}

games would have more glamourous match-

ups. _ 

But the committees must know what
they’re doing. After most of last year’s not
so exciting post—season games, it seems like

the trend for such matchups is continuingj}

this year. If these “major” bowls would
like to stay away from turning into eventual
laughing stocks, a revamping of thjeiricurrem
setup should be seriously considered. .

Pantherettes Bow to Terps;
Finish Finish Fourth in Easterns

By JOHN FINN
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pantherette volleyball team
ﬁnished ‘fourth at the Eastern
Regionals this weekend in Oswego
N.Y., failing to win a berth at the
National Championships.

The Pantherettes were impres-
sive on the ﬁrst day of the two-day
tournament. Pitt defeated
Rutgers, Penn and number-one
seed. Delaware to win its bracket
and gain the number one seed
going into Saturday’s competition..

In the semiﬁnal match, Pitt
dropped the first game to Maryland
7-15. However, in the second game
of the match, the Pantherettes
served twice for game point, but
failed to convert for the game-
winner. Maryland went on to win,
17-15.

Pitt head. coach Mike Hebert
reasoned the missed conversions of
game point may have been the
difference in the tournament. ‘‘If
we win that second game, then we
have the momentum, and I think

we would have won the third
game,” he said.

Instead the loss knocked the
Pantherettes out of contention for a
shot at the national title. In the
consolation match, Temple blasted
the disheartened Pitt spikers and
the Pantherettes ﬁnished fourth for
the second consecutive year.

“I thought we could have won
it,” said Hebert, “but I am still

very proud of the team and pleased
with the season.”

Hebert pointed to inexperience
as the key factor in Pitt’s losses.
“The only two teams that beat us
consistently (Maryland and
Temple) play year round,” he said.

‘‘If we can begin that kind of
system here, I’m sure we will do
even better, because we have more
talent.

So, once again, it is “Wait ’till
next year” for the Pitt volleyball
team, but it won’t be an inactive
winter. Off-season workouts begin
next week.

Paint may be a factor in the
performance of the Pitt wrestling
team this year. That’s right,
paint—yellow paint.

According to two-time all-
America wrestler Rande Stottle-
myer, the Field House’s newly
painted practice room walls are
making a big difference in his
attitude this season.

“Last year this place looked like a
dungeon——it was dingy and de-
pressing,” he said. “Now, it looks a
lot more cheerful.”

' Stottlemyer and the Pitt wrestling
team are preparing for their season
opener against the University of
Akron Tuesday night.

Head wrestling coach Dave
Adams said he feels the team
should do well against Akron.
“They’re good in their division, but
. iey’re in Division III and we’re in

I I.” he said. “We beat them the last

two years. We’ll have to be careful
not to underestimate them.”

Pitt’s team has three seniors: Bill
Bailey, George O’Korn and Stottle-
myer. Unfortunately, two top
wrestlers, Skip Bolin and Mark

ruck Down

“I wanted my parents to see us
get married.”

Contrary to some reports, Trout
didn’t get married on the 50-yard
line at Pitt Stadium. It was a
standard church wedding, complete
with minister and bridal party
instead of football coach and team.
None of Trout’s Panther teammates
were included in the wedding party,
although several—Joe Gasparovic,
Mark Schubert, Hugh Green and
Russ Grimm (who played football
with Trout at Southmoreland High
School)—were wedding guests.

Trout said there were no
objections to his marriage from the
Pitt coaching staff. Strange as it
sounds, college football coaches are
often touchy about their players
getting married.

“When I was recruited, I made it
clear I was planning to get
married,” Trout said. “They didn’t

only one of ﬁve marks.
Panthers’ first two bowlers
marked, but their third bowler
missed an easy spare, and Pitt
went down by 14 pins, 806-792.

In the second game, the
Colonials took an early lead, but
the Panthers put on a surge and
took the lead by one mark in the
sixth frame. Then, a lane broke,
causing a 15-minute delay in the
match. When play resumed, the
Panthers lost their ﬁre.

By

seem to mind. They just suggested
I wait until I got into my freshman
year, so I could get adjusted to
things at college. I said ‘no
problem.’ ”

More than a few people had their
plans ruined when Pitt moved its
game with Penn State from this
weekend to next weekend. Trout
was one of them.

“We were going to get married
next week,” Trout explained. “But.
then they moved the game back,
and we had to move it up a week. It
was a lucky thing we held back on
the invitations and everything, or
we would have been in pretty bad
shape. We had it timed just right.”

Asked if marriage will improve
his on-the-ﬁeld performance, Trout
laughed and said, “It should make
me better because. . .ah, I better not
go on.

Colonials

Mitch Haber, with 225, and Jeff
Kretz, with 199 were the top
scorers in Pitt’s third-game total of
835. The Colonials ﬁred an
incredible 1,008 third-game total to
take the win.

For the day, Haber’s 581 and
Kretz’s 563 led the Panthers. -“We
really didn’t bowl badly,” said
junior captain Geoff Joseph. “We
missed a lot of shots that could
have won one or two games today.

Anxious, Not Yellow

Stepanovich, will not contribute to
the Panther attack against Akron.

Bolin was involved in a car
accident this summer, and is
uncertain whether he will be back
this season. Adams said Bolin may
get an extension on his eligibility.

Stepanovich had cartilage in his
knee removed Friday, and will
return to the lineup after Christmas.

“If we had Bolin and Stepanovich
back, I’d say this would have been
the best wrestling team since l’ve
been here,” Adams said. “The
experience makes a big differ-
encef’

“It’s too early to tell about the
recruits,” Adams continued. “Glen
Maxwell will start at 118, Tom
Jones at 158, Mile Palko at
heavyweight. Mike Bond also will
be in the lineup.

“And we have several around the
middle—Steve Gouletas, Larry
Matthews and Jim Barnoski,”
Adams said. “I hope they’ll give us
some depth and additional help
before the year-is over.”

According to Adams, the wrest-
lers will face some tough competi-
tion this season. “It’s a very
representative schedule,” he said.

“We’ll participate in 18 dual meets,
including seven home meets.
Lehigh, Penn State, Bloomsburg,
Ohio State, navy and Cleveland
State all have the potential of being
in the top 20, so it won’t be an easy
year.

“More publicity would help the
morale,” Adams added. ‘ ‘If people
would be aware of the matches, we
could have a revenue-producing
sport. I

“The mat maids have helped,
and the Golden Panthers have been
a big asset. Now, we’re looking for
students to be big contributors at
the meets,” he said.

“Our primary objective is to
qualify for the national tournament
in March,” Adams said.

The yellow paint has helped
Stottlemyer thus far. perhaps the
students will help him and his
teammates achieve their goals
throughout the season.

The couple will postpone a
honeymoon until after the football
season.

Both Trout and his wife, a nursing
student at Hopwood Nursing School
in Uniontown. plan to continue their
education.

“We’re both staying in school,”
Trout said. “Cindy’s going to
graduate next December.

“lt’s going to be tough for a
while, ﬁnding time to get to-
gether,” Trout said. “We’re
working out some kind of commut-
ing situation, where we can spend

some time together in the
off-season and still be able to
continue school.”

Trout admitted he was nervous‘

about getting married. He feels the
same way heading into Saturday's
Pitt-Penn State .-game at Pitt
Stadium.

“I’m prepared,” Trout said.
“You have to prepare for all of your
games. But there's a little more
intensity for this game than the
other ones. It's kind of like the way
we felt going into the West Virginia
game. We're taking it a little more
seriously.
