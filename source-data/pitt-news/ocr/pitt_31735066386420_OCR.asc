Pitt Waits ,
for ruling
on union

By Donna Terrell
Staff Writer

Forming a faculty union has
been a topic of debate at the
University of Pittsburgh for the
last 15 years.

Administrators at the,Pitt ruled
that faculty members do not
have the right to unionize because
they are managers. This ruling is
based on a United States Supreme
Court decision in 1985. The
Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that
faculty at Yeshiva, a private
college in New York, could not
unionize because they were
managers.

Pitt professor and president of
United Faculty Philip Wion thinks

Middle East experturges U.S. to curb involvement in Gulf

By J. L. Marshall
StajfW’rlter

At least one Pitt professor thinks that the
United States has no business in the
Persian Gulf and should leave the Arabs
alone so they can settle their own affairs.

“We [the U.S.] like to call ourselves
civilized. If we are so civilized, I think it’s
time we stopped dictating other people’s
destinies and playing with their histories.

' If the Arabs want to unite, let them unite.

They know their own area. We don’t
know it at all,” said retired professor Dick
Cottam.

“It’s worth considering, isn't it? Especially
when you consider the alternative, it’s
very worth considering.”

Cottam proposed an alternative to the

Middle East crisis that doesn't involve war. '

Cottam’s advocation of a regional
settlement without the intervention of
foreign forces received a standing ovation.

Cottam, a Middle East expert, was the

highlight event ofa teach—in on the Persian
Gulf crisis on Tuesday, Oct. 23 at the
Community of Reconciliation.

Cottam’s speech, titled “The Meaning of
the Persian Gulf Crisis,” covered such
topics as the background and origins of
the Gulf crisis, a regional settlement as a
plausible solution to the crisis, and who
favors and opposes war if the United
States were to wage war against Iraq.‘

“A year ago, I thought my life was really
fulﬁlled; the Cold War was over. I never
thought I’d live to see [the end of it],”
Cottam said.

“And now a year later I’m faced with the
prospect of another unnecessary war which
will also be terribly costly in terms of
human lives and resources. I feel even
more helpless at this point thanl did then,"
Cottam said.

Cottam criticized the way the U.S. media
has reported on the situation in the Gulf.

.“.The part that depresses me is that
unless you're Houdini, you don’t have the

slightest idea what the Arab or Islamic or
regional solution is because nobody is
reporting it in our press,” Cottam said.
Cottam expressed doubt that the U.S.
government has asked the Arab people
what they want the settlement to be.

Cottam said that several important Arab
leaders, however, have met in four different
cities to discuss the possibility of a peaceful
regional solution. An outline includes Iraq’s
withdrawing from Kuwait and setting up
an organization that would permit Saddam
Hussein very little freedom of action.

Once the embargo begins to bite, Cottam
believes Hussein will start searching for
outside help.

“These countries have said, in effect,
‘We’ll help you at a certain point, but we’ll
determine the price.’ And that price is the
containment of Hussein and the restoration
of freedom of action for Kuwait,” Cottam
said.

He also said that many people in the
United States are unaware of the situation

in the Middle East.

“They don’t look at it and how can they
when our journalists don’t cover it?” he
asked. . \

According to Cottam, the newspapers
in the Middle East are talking about the
arrival of the United States, and although
they may not agree whether Hussein’s
actions are justified or not, they agree that
the United States is their primary enemy.

“What they are saying is that the United
States is determined to stay there and
maintain its hegemonic control indeﬁnitely
and that we want to do that because of the
imperialistic imperative. But more
speciﬁcally, we want to control the -oil,
and we want the power of controlling the
people,” Cottam said.

Cottam believes Hussein attacked
Kuwait to unite the Arab world. “He
wanted it to be a spectacular victory

which would make him the greatest Arab
since [Gamal Abdall Nassar, and he got a
black eye,” he said. i

Casey, Hafer support diﬁerent ways to fund education

By Leo Hoh
Staff Writer

Both of Pennsylvania's
gubernatorial candidates have
pledged to make higher
education a key concern if
elected.

“lGov.] Robert Casey knows
what a hassle the price of college
tuition can be these days. He
speaks from experience: all of
his eight children are either in
college or graduated from
college," said Frank Lynch,
deputy press secretary for Casey.

Lynch said that one of the
overriding themes of Casey's
support for colleges and students
is keeping college— tuition cost
down.

But Ron Ruman,
secretary for Barbara Hafer, said
when Casey was asked how he
was going to balance the budget,
he said that he would look at
non-preferred appropriations,
the bulk of that money going to
schools like Pitt, Penn State and
Temple.

Ruman said Hafer would do
what she could to work with
state Legislature to obtain as
much money as possible for
those schools.

“These are the schools where
the working people send their
children. They don’t have the
money to afford higher tuition
bills," said Ruman. Hafer realizes
how difficult it is to pay rising
tuition costs because she has a

press,

daughter attending Penn State,
said Ruman.

Over the past four years Casey
has kept to this theme by
instituting a Tuition Challenge
Grant to universities and colleges
in Pennsylvania, said Lynch. The
grant rewards colleges that keep
their tuition increases below a
$100-per-student or a 6-percent
increase, said Lynch.

Lynch added that the $41
million has gone into the
program since it began in 1987.

Hafer supports the tuition-
account program that is being
debated in the state Senate,
which would allow families to
buy college credits now and go
to college later, said Ruman.

Journalism.” Dorothy, former Miss
Senior Pennsylvania, grieving
widow and Gladys’ Mello Puff
Bowling League teammate,
inspired Gladys’ delayed entry
into the highly emotional world
of senior-citizen beauty contests.
Dorothy's mingled excitement
and pain — now here was the
real story.

But her assistant viewed it
differently.

“She didn’t see the relationship
as the main focus,” said Laskas.
Instead, the assistant compiled
general facts. I

Writing which reﬂects the

journalism” more comprehensive

HOD-fiC[lOI'1, said the writers and
editors who spoke at the
symposium, sponsored in part
by the Pitt English-writing
department.

“The best journalism tells a
story and pulls the reader there in
a way that reveals a greater truth,”

said Sally Kalson, a columnist for
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and
a participant in a writers’ panel,
“Art andAccuracy: Canjournalism
Have Both?"

Kalson and Laskas discussed
the pitfalls and advantages of a
marriage of facts and fiction-
writing techniques, with James
Conaway, the author of four non-
fiction books; Bill Moushey, a
reporter for the Post-Gazette, and
moderator Lee Gutkind, professor
of non-fiction writing at Pitt and
author of many non-fiction
novels.

“The art comes in ‘where you
get the story from the facts,” said
Kalson. “You want to get the
essence of the story, rather than
milquetoast five W’s and an H,”
said Moushey, contemptuous of
traditional journalism’s mandate
that the “why, where, who, what,
when and how” be the sole focus
of a story.

Although literary journalists
heavily involve their own
perceptions in their writing,
Kalson stressed that “there’s no
substitute for accurate reporting.”

Stephen Petranek, senior editor
at Life magazine, agrees. “I don't
think you can have good [non-
fiction] writing without a foothold
in facts and information," said
Petranek, “but that’s just a
foothold, and you make a leap
from there.”

Literary journalism, a skillful
expression of the truth enhanced
with a writer’s passion, is “putting
yourself into your subject matter
and writing about it in the best
possible way, ” to Carol Hymowitz,
Pittsburgh bureau chief of The

Wall Street journal.

Petranek, Hymowitz andjames
Davidson, the lifestyle editor for
The Pittsburgh Press, discussed
“The Editor’s Point of View” with
moderator Bruce Van
Wyngarden, editor of Pittsburgh
magazine, and Patsy Sims,
symposium coordinator.

There is a need for literary
journalism because “the rules of
the game in standard journalism
are inhibiting,” said Petranek.

Readers are demanding a
greater degree of interpretation,

Fmts will help monitor own parties

By Jim Wechsler
suqr Writer

The Inter-Fraternity Council
discussed plans for a new social
committee to monitor Greek
function at their meeting this
week.

The committee will ensure that
Greek social functions are
conducted in accordance with
IFC regulations. Presently, these
duties include insuring that no
one drinks underage, that
alternative beverages are offered,
that the bartenders are at least 21
years old, that the parties are
open only to invited guests, that
these guest lists are enforced and
that all outside doors are
monitored.

This duty is currently performed
by the IFC executive board, which
consists of the IFC president,

internal and external vice

secretary.

According to Brent Saunders,
external vice president of the
IFC, some members of the council
were not satisfied with the existing
procedures for monitoring social
events. He said that the new
committee will hopefully solve
the problems because it will
consist of volunteers from the
individual fraternities.

“If we have a procedure set in
writing, it would make the IFC
executive board accountable to
the members. I want the
fraternities to have more input
into the policy. Therefore, they
can’t complain about the policy,”
Saunders said.

Members of the national chapter

During the Casey administration, there has been a 46-percent
increase in grants to groups such as Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency, said Lynch.

State support for institutional assistant grants for private
schools is up 53 percent, and grants for the disadvantaged and

Lynch.

“From 1976 to 1986 Pennsylvania was dead-last in terms of an
increase for support of higher education. During Casey's four
years, the state of Pennsylvania improved itself to the 40th
overall state,” said Lynch.

the administration is exercising
unfair labor practices by trying to
block faculty unionization. He
thinks that using a “legal
technicality” to stop faculty
unionization is anti-democratic.

“Democracy is coming to
Eastern Europe before it comes
to Pitt,” Wion said.

Associate Provost Jim Hunter
disagreed.

“It’s simply not true,” Hunter
said. “We are using a process of
using the law to answer questions.
There is nothing anti—democratic
about that. ” He said Wion is using
unfair terms to describe the
university's position on

unionization “because Mr. Wion
wants a union."

In March of 1987, a hearing
examiner from the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board said only
full-time faculty members and
librarians are managers and
ordered an election be held for
part—time faculty to unionize. The
election resulted in a 329-289
vote in favor of unionization.

The university will not negotiate
with part—time faculty until the
PLRB makes a decision on the
1989 faculty appeal of the decision
based on the Yeshiva ruling that
they are managers.

Wion is anxious to find out
what the labor board’s decision

will be on the appeal. He said he
wants to have a faculty vote on
unionization by the end of this
academic year before the new
university president takes over.
This would fulfill the need to
completely change the rules of
the game,” Wion said.

Having a union, according to
Hunter, establishes an “adversarial
relationship.” He thinks faculty
and administrators should
continue to work on improving
their “collegial” relationship.

Hunter said that having a union
would lessen Pitt’s chances of
attracting qualiﬁed candidates for
president.

university has a faculty union,"
Hunter said.

Having a union would Change
the decision-making process at
Pitt, which follows the top-to-
bottom model of large
corporations, Wion said. He feels
the faculty role in the decision-
making process is not what it
should be.

The role of the faculty assembly
is only advisory, according to
Wion. He said the administration
ignores or rejects views of the
assembly. Only a union, he said,
will strengthen the position of
the faculty in relation to the
administration.

In 1982 the United Faculty was
formed. After obtaining the
required percentage of faculty
signatures, United Faculty
successfully petitioned the state’s
labor board to hold another

faculty election for unionization
at Pitt.

The elections were never held.
After a series of “inappropriate
hearings, ” according to Wion, the
administration ruled the faculty
had changed. The administration
said more people were in the
bargaining unit than there were
when UF petitioned for the vote.

Voting patterns of the past
reveal there is not an
overwhelming majority of Pitt
faculty in favor of unionization.
“I doubt that the faculty here at
Pitt would want a union,” said
Hunter. “The situation of a strike
hurts everyone, especially the
students." He is sure that the
majority of faculty recognize the
quality of education and employ-«
ment conditions at Pitt, saying
they know it is difficult to “find a
large university that solicits and
accepts the advice of the senate."

Give faculty right to vote

One of the strongest ideas of a capitalist economy is the
right of workers to unionize. Unfortunately, the University

of Pittsburgh does not -believe that its faculty members

should have that right.

The Pitt administration stated recently that its faculty
does not have the right to strike because its members are
considered “managers.” e According to a 1985 Supreme
Court ruling, managers are those people who have the
authority to make decisions and, therefore cannot unionize
under federal law.

This decision came from a 1980 court ruling which
stated that faculty members at Yeshiva University in New
York were managers and could not unionize. But Yeshiva
is it liiit/é’tt‘é surest, which falls under federal laws. Pitt is
a public school and therefore should follow state guidelines.

In March 1987, a hearing examiner from the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board decided that only full-time faculty
and librarians held the positions of managers which could
not strike. This, however, did not include the part-time

‘ faculty members.

Because of this, the university will not negotiate with
this group until the PLRB makes a decision on its status.

Associate Provost Jim Hunter said that the faculty
members at Pitt probably would not want a union
because they recognize the quality of education and
employment conditions at this university. Yet that quality
is not necessarily reﬂected in its faculty’s salaries.

In a 1989-90 comparison by the Association of American
Universities of college faculty salaries, Pitt’s ranking
dropped to 50 out of 57 schools polled. Furthermore, non-
medical personnel salaries fell $5,600 short of the median
salary. ‘

Faculty members at Pitt’s branch campuses get even less _

than their Oakland counterparts. For example, the average
salary at Pitt—Johnstown is approximately $12,600 less
than that of the faculty members at the main campus.

Hunter also claims that by starting a faculty union at Pitt,
it would cause an adversarial relationship among
negotiators for both sides. But low salaries are already
causing that split, as Pitt faculty President Philip Wion says
that this would be the first order of business for this
ﬂedgling union.

The university, by not allowing the faculty to vote on

unionization, is forcing the faculty to take only what it is
given. But the threat of a vote obviously does not frighten
the university that much because Hunter said that, “I
doubt that the faculty here at Pitt would want a union.”

The university should give the members of the faculty
the right to vote on unionization. That way they will see
what they really want and not what the administration
thinks they should have.

Condemn U.S. in Saudi Arabia?

On Sept. 21, the faculty council
of the School of Education passed
a resolution condemning the U.S.
presence in Saudi Arabia. While
there has been much debate on
this resolution, few students have
read it in its entirety. I present for
their edification the complete text
of the resolution along with my
interjected comments:

Members of the School of
Education Faculty Council  .

I certainly hope they don’t mean
all members. ‘

 condemn the United States

policy in theMiddle East and call
for an immediate withdrawal
and reduction of the American
militarypresence in SaudiArabia
and the surrounding region.

Now I’m confused. These are A

supposedly educated people, yet
their resolution calls for a
withdrawal, then a reduction.
Seems to me the one would make
the other unnecessary.

The current American policy
has needlessly placed the world
on the brink of a major war

The vast majority of people
who know something about the
issue seem to think this was
Saddam Hussein’s doing.

 and jeopardizes the lives of
thousands of American citizens
as well as citizens of many other
nations.

I wonder if they include the
citizens of Kuwait among citizens
of many other nations. There,
atrocities such as a woman in
labor being disemboweled by an
Iraqi soldier with a bayonet are
common.

Furthermore, the cost of our
governments involvement in the
Middle East will result in drastic
reductions in resources which are
necessaryto educate ourchildren,
feed the hungry and help the
homeless here in ourown country
and around the world.

 

Rob
Lewis

This is probably true. It is also
probably true that if reckless
spending was not condoned by
these types of people for so long,
we would not be in such severe
debt that this action would
necessitate spending cutsin other
areas.

Council further resolves that a
peaceful diplomatic solution to
the crisis be sought 

With what “bargaining chip
besides military force? Hussein
has demonstrated that he is not
a man swayed by kisses and nice
thoughts.

 and that the United States
develop a responsible energy
policy which will reduce or
eliminateAmerican dependence
on foreign oil...

...but one which does not

increase American use of atomic
energy, another favorite target of
liberal outrage. Indeed, after
American militarism, it may be
their favorite.

This resolution, though, is
especially appalling since it does
not take into account the plain
fact that American forces were
formally invited in by the Saudi
Arabian government in response
to a genuine *Iraqi threat. We
cannot believe that Hussein will
not invade Saudi Arabia given his
empty promise not to act militarily
against Kuwait. These facts area’:
quite clear to the more than 80
percent of the American people
who support our actions there.

That this mi-nority of the public
is a majority of the faculty council
of the School of Education is a
very disquieting thought. We are
forced to accept the fact that
these professors, who are
supposed to be leaders in the
community and the nation, haven-
grown so far out of touch with
the people that they can no longer
represent and work for their best
interests. They need to be
confronted with a little reality.

Therefore, I urge any student
who feels, as I do, that the people
who passed this resolution are
utterly wrong, to attend the little
symposium they are planning to .5
hold on Nov. 7. Let’s tell them
that the students are against their
beliefs and actions and put a little
fear of the 1960s into them.

Hafer ad sheds new Light on Casey,

This letter is in response to the
position of The Pitt News toward
the commercials of Republican
gubernatorial candidate Barbara
Hafer concerning abortion rights.
In its editorial, ThePittNews says,
“Her ad is just another ploy to
attract attention to abortion rights,
 and this commercial is in poor
taste and should be discontinued
immediately."

In reality, Barbara Hafer’s
commercial has shed “new light"
on the position of Gov. Bob Casey
toward abortion.

Letters

During the gubernatorial debate
held earlier this month in
Philadelphia, Casey, who had

previously supported one of the
toughest abortion laws in the
nation, said that he was only for
abortion rights when the mother’s
life was in danger. Victims of
incest and rape, as the commercial
portrayed, would be forced to
have an unwanted child, if Casey

gets his way[...] "5"

Editor in Chief

n Saturday
afternoon the
streets of Oak-
land teemwith
huddled mass-
es heading up
to Pitt Stadium to watch the
football game. In the midst of
banter and prattle, resounding
African congas draw people’s
attention to the corner of Forbes
and Oakland avenues, where
Shona Sharif leads a group of
students and community
members through an exercise in
African American dance.

Sharif, a Pitt black-studies
teacher and acting director of the
dance studio, instructs
approximately 18 students in
Dunham technique,
melding West African— and
Caribbean—infIu_enced dance
teachings of Katherine Dunham,
an internationally acclaimed
dancer, choreographer and
anthropologist.

According to Sharif, Dunham
studied the dances of Africans
and Caribbeans, and upon visiting
Haiti, combined the information
she had and drew from her own
culture and created her own
interpretation.

Sharif said that in developing
her style, Dunham took some of
the delicate, outward motions of
ballet dancing and modified the
movements into isolationist
moves. and a more detractive
technique. 

“It’s a tradition that I’m trying to
carry out,” Sharif said. “She was
giving black dancers a technique
they can be proud of. I think she
discovered something that the
black people needed. It’s a part
of our roots,” she said.

Of the role of dance in these
societies, Sharif said, “These
people had their dance, but it’s
not a style or a technique like
ballet is a technique or jazz is a
technique that you can teach
people. This is the way they
dance; this is part of their culture
and a part of their religion.”

“Some people don’t like ballet;

 

some people don’t like jazz. Some ,
people say they're going to do-

something natural that’s related
to them,” she said.

Arts is the setting for Sharifs
class. The room is adorned with

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

If Brian Berger, music director for WPTS, had $20 in his
pocket right now, he’d go get something to eat, get the new
Galaxie S00 album and save the last $5 for lunch tomorrow.

Berger, who lives for music, said that “Music soothes my
savage beast.”

Boasting an collection of 300 million albums (give or take
a few) Berger insists that his position, which is often
mistaken as the WPTS “music snob,” is actually one of
wheeling and dealing with minor and major record labels.
“I get to talk to a lot of people on the phone who I don’t want
to talk to  these people are only interested in the sale,” he

their stigma in the music world. “The Screaming
Trees just signed to Epic, which kind of sucks
because now they’re going to go on tour with
Social Distortion  they’ll only get to play 30-
rninute sets instead of headlining the show."

Berger’s tastes in music are quite varied as
is evident through the albums he selects for
rotation at WPTS. “I’m a little bit biased toward the
harder-edged music, as long as it’s not standard run-of—the—
mill pop like Salem 66 or the Sundays,” he said. “I got some
white funk in my soul too.”

Because Berger is ultimately responsible for what is heard
on the air, he sees his role, and that of college radio in
general, as one of the initiator. “I hope that we are. I don’t
think that we follow trends at all. If yop look at the charts
like College Music Journal of the top 50 albums of what
college stations are playing, we might only be playing 10 of
them.”

This may, at times, put Berger at odds with some
promoters. “There’s a lot of pressure on music directors in
college radio because they get so much feedback from
promoters [about what to play]. I don’t think that’s right; I

said of the major labels which approach Pitt’s radio station. think it should be a personal choice of what the station
Berger maintainsa great deal of respect for bands that are wants. I mean, I don’t know how many stations in the
Paul Dlamondffhe Pitt News on smaller and lesser-ﬁnanced labels; unfortunately, those country are playing Lubricated Goat in heavy rotation,” said

Flying Pig takes improvisational theater to new heights 2

“ By Matt Goldstein

For The Pitt News

“Book ‘em, Danno.”

So you Friday night improv-
goers at Pitt think you might have
a little competition? \X/hen pigs

1 ﬂy, you say! Well they are. And
I I you do.

At The Artery in Shadyside, a
brand new group called The
Flying Pig Theater kicked off its
first show, “Reality Optional,” an
improvisational theater troupe of
about 16 players who daringly
and brilliantly take the audience’s
suggestions, turning them into

and skits.

After the opening number,
“Reality Optional,” inviting the
audience to be both playwright
and director, an energetic and
bubbly young woman, Kym
Helbi g asks the audience to shout
out their favorite song. Using the
response as the first line, two
people create a scene which
progresses, as they say, from
beginning to at least a middle,
until another cast member yells
the magic word, “Freeze!” Then
she creates a new scene starting
with the last line of the previous
scene, taking the performers’ end
position. And on and on  From

racquet on a shelf to a father
reprimanding his son practicing
for Swan Lake — the Bull Swan.

Many a Pitt improvisor is used
to the “Freeze” technique, which
is at the core of “Reality Optional.”
However, the group goes beyond
this to do some wildly impressive
stunts. Some Pitt students will
recognize the old “movie
dubbing” improv in which two

performers mouth and act out a
scene while two other performers
supply the words. While the
group uses suggestions" from the
audience, the audience does not
actually participate in the action
on stage, creating more of a show.

Talk shows are a great source
of material, especially when the
guests are Marlon Brando, Martha
Quinn and —— The Angry Man.
Laura Lind, quick on her feet as

Martha when asked about her
sex life, quips, “Nothing compares
with Bobby Brady.”

My favorite, and it seems to me
the most challenging of the
group’s efforts, was when each
person was given a blunder for
certain situations, thrown out
from the crowd. One guy was
given “picking his nose” in the
grocery store while another was

In the Soviet Union, posters

The main themes dealt with in
these posters are social, political

anniversary of the birth of the
poet Lermontov, support for
heroic soldiers, announcements
of foreign and Soviet movies, as
well as democracy, perestroika
and glasnost.

K. Ivanov combines words and
images most effectively and
attractively. Two of Ivanov’s more
serious posters deal with AIDS
and the problem of laziness on
the job. Another deals with the
progress of U.S./Soviet Union
relations: This poster shows a
missile broken in half with the
two ﬂags standing in part of it.

The caption reads, ‘An enormous
step has been made in an
important matter!’

A more amusing poster by the
same artist shows a military ﬁgure
from the waist down. Protruding
from his shiny boots are four
men: One holds a gun; one has
been shot; one is shouting, and
one holds an envelope marked
“denunciation.” The caption
reads, “The machine that
suppressed the people needed ‘a
screw.”’

Another humorous poster, this
one by B. Yeﬁmor, comments on
the problems of bureaucracy in
the Soviet Union. Seven goofy-

‘mismanagement,
embezzlement, irresponsibility,
bribery, negligence, arrogance,”
and the caption below reads:
"They are still roaming around
the country  but how many
woes do we have because of
them!"

New social problems have
surfaoedfor the Soviets with the
advent of perestroika. S. Uvarov’s
poster, titled “Evolution?” shows
faceless children against a red
background, screaming their
desires ("drums, kitty, candy,
clothes?) as the words splatter
behind their heads.

A ravenous pig greedily
attempts to devour the Earth in a
poster by Y. Bokser that reads,
‘According to UNESCO, if present
tendencies continue to the year
20()0, resources will diminish.”

Concern for the welfare of
animals is demonstrated in a
poster that shows a dog with a
price tag for 150 nrbles attached
to its furry ear.

Fascinating both artistically and
culturally, this showis currently
on exhibit at the Hewlett Gallery
in the Fine Arts building of

that ﬂex and stretch the variety of
neck, leg, back and pelvic muscles
that will be tapped throughout
the experimental dance
workshop.

Lynn Lebowitz, a social worker
at Western Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic is one of Sharifs pupils.
When she began, the transition
from other dancing she had done
to this type was somewhat trying.
Lebowitz has persevered and now
uses her dancing as a stress-
relieving mechanism. “It’s kind
of my therapy. I come here every
week to kind of forget what I’ve
been doing.”

Sabira Bushra’s interest in this
dance comes from her
appreciation for the African
heritage. “It’s closer to whatl do
every day. I listen to African music.
When I came here, it wasn’t
foreign to me,” she said. As well,
Bushra doesn't see the dance as

Berger.

WPT S follows a rotation play
list where disc jockeys can choose
from albums that are classified as
heavy, medium or light. “What
we feel are the best albums are in
heavy rotation; medium are those
that might get tired if they were
played too much in heavy, and
light can be basically anything,”
he said.

Since Berger does have ﬁnal
say in what album is played and
how often, his music snobbery

 

may be something more than just
a rnild-mannered rib, but Berger
said, “I don’t think I’m power-
hungry. I think I have a
commitment to play music that is
not the standard for everyone.
Some people might see it as [being
power-hungry], but I don’t think
it’s power at all.”

Although he said that music is
his life, he has many otherinterests
ranging from politics, to sports to
the existence of UFOs. “I believe
in UFOs; there are just too many
things to disprove ltheml.”

Student Focus
Group  

Computing and Information Services (CIS) has developed a forum for student input
concerning the University's student computing services. This forum, the Computing and
Information Services Student Focus Group, has been meeting since September 1989..

The goal of the Focus Group is to review the computing lab services offered by
CIS and to provide input regarding the future direction of the labs.

The Focus Group is seeking interested individuals to join. If you would like to
participate, please attend the next meeting of the Student Focus Group on:

 

Berger, who is a junior majoring
in communications at Pitt, took a
year off and spent some time in
the Dominican Republic. “I lived
in a shack and drank El Presidente
beer,” he said smiling.

Berger is also adamant about
world politics, in particular the
situation in the Mideast. “I think
[the United States] should be out
of Iraq. This waris basically about
money, which unfortunately
makes the world go ‘round,” he
said, “I don’t believe anything the
government says; I don’t even

know if I believe the nightly
news.”

After Berger graduates from
Pitt, he’d like to start a band and
live in New York. He is currently
involved in a project where he
and two other people are starting
their own record label, Ice Age.
“We’re waiting to hear from
certain individuals that we’re
hoping to sign,” he said.
Fortunately for Berger, though,
he has a new good-luck charm
which has proven to be lucrative

then the group, led by a
neurotic choir master, began
a recital, singing an invented
chorus to the tune of “Found
a Peanut.” Individually the
performers would
spontaneously incorporate
each of their blunders into
rhyming verse throughout
the number.

The Flying Pig Theater,

Resurrection: Pitt attempts to salvage season

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

In a season marked by failed
expectations and the almost-
improbable hope for any kind of
a bowl bid, what better impetus
could a football team possibly
have than to play the No. 3 team
in the country to try and redeem
a disappointing season?

The Panthers are hanging by a
thread, and keeping it from being
cut will be no delicate task. If
Irish coach Lou Holtz thinks
someone up above is watching
over his team, then it just may be
the three ‘Fate’ sisters of Greek-
mythology fame who might cut
the thread for Pitt on Saturday.

This game is not of such celestial
magnitude, but for Pitt a win may
be close to that signiﬁcance.
History is not in Pitt’s favor, as the
Irish lead the all-time series 34-
16-1, dating back to 1909. And
speaking of magnitude, this game
for the Irish is of no small
importance. 1

“We want to have good
practices this week,” Holtz said.
“By a good practice, I don’t mean
everybody jumping up and down
and giving each other high-fives.
I’m talking about punching the
time» card, getting out there in an
effort to get better fundamentally.
I think the progress we make [in
the Pitt game] this week will be
critical if we hope to have any
degree of success [the rest of the
yearl.”

The Pitt offense is in dire need
of showing up earlier in games to
put points on the board according
to Coach Paul Hackett. If it doesn’t
show up early this week, the
offense may not have a chance to
pull out its fourth-quarter heroics.

' Last week, the Panthers showed
signs of offensive prowess in the
latter half of the Louisville game,
as Alex Van Pelt marched the
team on 82- and 65-yard
touchdown drives in a 27-20 loss.
And the same late offensive spark
ﬂickered in the tie with Syracuse
at the Carrier Dome.

However, while Pitt has posted

up 57 total points in its last three ‘

contests with the Irish, most of

_ them have come during the first

half of the action. Pitt has not
scored a touchdown during the
second half of any of those games.

But Holtz does not use such
figures to cite his advantages.

“We’ve nevergone to Pitt since
I’ve been here and not had to
fight for our lives. We’ve had
difficulty with Pitt even before I
was here,” he said.

Also, artiﬁcial turf has never
been a favorite of Holtz’, even
though Pitt was gracious enough
to lay down $2.2 million worth
before the season started.

“We’re going to have to get
better ‘on defense because we’re
playing on AstroTurf. This will be
the first of three games we’ll play
on turf, which I really dislike, but
we don’t have any other option,”
Holtz said.

Hackett will have the home-
field turf to his advantage, but he
will have to contend with some
serious visiting obstacles. On
defense, the Irish start nine
seniors, including standout nose
tackle Chris Zorich and linebacker
Mike Stonebreaker. Ironically, the
two remaining starters are
freshmen: free safety T om Carter
and right cornerback Greg Lane.

Holtz does have his concerns
about Pitt exploiting members of
his young secondary.

“Pitt goes deep eight to 10
times a game. Most teams only
throw it two or three times. Miami
threw deep five times and
completed four. Pitt goes deep
often and makes you defend the
entire field. If you go to sleep, it’ll
get you beat quicker — than
anything in this world,” he said.

And on offense there will be
one, if not the, most serious threat
in the nation, Raghib Ismail. Ismail
leads the Irish in receiving, punt
and kickoff returns, and all-
purpose offense.

“Notre Dame is clearly the best
team in the country,” Hackett
said. “I don’t think there’s any
question about it. The fact that
they stumbledlonce I really think
should be ignored.

“[Ismail is] probably the finest
player, at least one at the top of
his game, in the country,” he
added.

After Notre Dame’s defeat of
the Miami Hurricanes last week,

g Holtz admitted to his team’s being

on an emotional high. For the
traditionally staunch skipper, his
team went overboard in violatin g
standard operating procedure.
“The best thing you can do is
have your team flat for the
opening game and then try to

maintain that so you’ll be the

same [through the season]. The
best thing is to never get up real
high. We violated that last week.
We were at an emotional peak,"
Holtz said.

But for Hackett, he wouldn’t
mind a little emotion and fire one
bit.

“Obviously the year hasn’t gone
exactly the way we would have

liked at this point, but whatwould
you rather have but two of the
top teams in the country to get
out of our slump?”

And get his chance he will.

Offensive line says ND defense second to Louisville

By Linda Holley

The Pitt offensive line doesn't
appear to be as concerned about
the highly ranked Irish defense

forgetting that Notre Dame, 5-51,
finished with the best record (12-
1) in the country last year? That
the Irish have attended three
straight bowl games, 1988-90,

and ran and contained.”

Left tackle Mike LiVorio agreed
with his teammates, adding how
Louisville has a lot of pass rushers
on its defense that know a variety
of moves.

“I’m not taking any credit away
from Notre Dame,” LiVorio
quickly said, “but from a pass
perspective, Louisville had a much
better defensive line.”

But last week Pitt couldn't
protect quarterback Alex Van Pelt
from the rush. Van Pelt threw two
interceptions and fumbled once.

‘-5.

“We're going to try and stay in ‘
our blocks and finish our blocks, ‘

and hopefully things will work
out, " said right tackle Scott Miller.

That sounds like living on a
prayer, but both Sestili and LiVorio

claim, “We’re going to show up '

with a different team this week,
and we think the people should
come out and watch.”

The Panthers were referring to _ _

the recent bad press Pitt fans
have been getting. “I rememberl
came out, and there was
practically no one in the stands,”
LiVorio said. “You shouldn't let
that affect you, but some players
think if fans aren't going to come
out and see us, what do we have
to play for.”

Notre Dame fans are known ,
for their loyalty. Irish head coach ‘

Lou Holtz said, “Our fans expect

a minor miracle every Saturday

and a major one every now and

then.” This is a lot of pressure

Notre Dame more than ‘just another opponentf

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Usually, football players will
never adrnit to one game having
any more meaning or being any
bigger than another during the
course of a football season. For
Pitt, that means players will tell
you Ohio University is no bigger
[la game than Oklahoma. And
players will almost have you
convinced that they are actually
thinking this way.
Coaches certainly want their
athletes to project this even— keel,
nerves-of—steel attitude. Let’s face

‘it ~— business is business, and

emotion has little or no place in
a big—time college—football
program when discussing
upcoming games.

But hey, Pitt’s playing No. 3
Notre Dame Saturday. It’s cause

for a little excitement, don’t you
think?

This is no time for trite football
cliches. Forget the “we just take
‘em one game at a time  they’re
no different than anyone else 
no, we’re not doing anything
special to prepare for them ...”
This is Notre Dame we’re talking
about.

“Right now, we’re fighting for
our lives and trying to salvage
our season, or what’s left of it. We
can make our whole season
beating a team like [Notre Dame]
because they have everything to
lose, and we have everything to
gain. We have to redeem
"ourselves in some way,” said
senior safety Louis Riddick.

That’s the spirit! Some real
excitement and the sense that
playing the No. 3 team in the
country means just a little bit

  It’s not whether you win or lose,
but where you play after the game.-

_ “You respect Notre Dame for
who they are and what they’ve
accomplished. If you beat them,
it makes you look real good.
That’s real motivation for me and
the fact that this is the last time I’ll
ever get to play against them,”
Riddick added.

For Pitt, the team does not
need to heed the extraneous
mystique surrounding the Irish,
their winning tradition, their
squeaky-clean image. No, Pitt
doesn’t need to succumb to such
far-out claims, like the one Lou
Holtz made, about someone up
above looking out for the Boys
from South Bend.

In fact, if someone up above is
looking out for the Irish, how
come he or she let them lose to
unranked Stanford? Truly a
question of celestial magnitude.

No, all Pitt needs to do is play

some good football at home, at
night and on national television.

“Any time you play Notre Dame,
it's not just another game because
they’re always tops in the country.
One of the main reasons I came
to Pitt is because I’d get a chance
to play teams like Notre Dame
and Miami. The fact that we
haven’t had such la good season]
makes this game almost a bowl
for us,” said the nation’s top
punter, Brian Greenﬁeld.

“We’re deﬁnitely in the role of
a spoiler because of our record
(3-3-1), and a lot of people say
they’re the best team in the
country. Winning for Pitt is the
most important thing, but beating
Notre Dame is a very close
second,” he added.

Senior linebacker Prentiss
Wright is occupied with thoughts
of Saturday’s game,‘ but he also
has some secondary concerns
that have been voiced before.

A message to the fans 

“GET FIRED UP, PLEASE!! My
God, against Louisville, I was
really upset. I was trying to get
the fans fired up, and everyone
was looking at me like I was
some kind of an idiot.

“Nothing’s going to stop me
because that’s my style, and «I-3
love to play the game of football.
But it would help if I could get
somebody involved in what I'm
trying to accomplish. Everybody
seems to be dead. I feel like
throwing a grenade out there!”
Wright said.

If the Panthers could not get
fired up for a nationally televised,
contest against the country’s third-
ranked team, then maybe the
team should resort to drastic
measures and bring in a team
psychologist, a guru or a psychic.
However, such is not the case.

But if Pitt fans can't get fired up
just being at this game,lthen
maybe Wright should throw a
grenade.

Line
Continued from page P-4
when your team is on the prowl

for a national championship.

Sestili knows Notre Dame will

be up for Saturday’s game, and V

he’s looking to knock the Irish
down. “We’re looking to be the

spoiler thisweek, ” he said. “We’re“

going to come out a lot looser, a
lot quicker and play a different
ball game than the fans have seen
in the past few games.”

Pitt is hoping to capitalize on

the home—turf advantage. Holtz
said at a press conference
Tuesday, “I don’t like playing on

turf, but you have to deal with the .

option.”

Notre Dame will probably start
more cautiously on the turf which
will give Pitt an opportunity to
take the lead. Unfo:‘unately, the
Panthers haven’t been coming
alive until the fourth quarter.

“If we can take our fourth
quarter from the last game

[Louisville] and keep it going and
start off strong, we can do it,”
LiVorio said.

Sestili agreed. “We just have to
put everything behind us right
now and play the way that we
know we’re capable of playing.”

With little pressure for a Bow‘.-’*
bid, Pitt could prove to be a
challenge to Notre Dame. The
Panthers defeated the Irish in
1983, ’86 and ’87. ‘

“We’ve never gone to Pitt
without having to fight for our
lives,” Holtz kindly said about
the current 3-3-1 Panther squad.
Holtz is known for playing down
his team and building up the;
opponent.

Holtz said he will be watching
Pitt’s explosive offensive line and
the scrambling Van Pelt, who is
120 out of 209 for 1,519 yards
passing. “Pitt runs the ball with a
more professional concept, going
deep eight to 10 times a game.
You can't go to sleep out on the
field. You’re forced to defend the
entire ﬁeld,” he added.

Soccer
shut out

Morris

By Christopher Block
Staﬂ“ Writer

While the rides at
Kennywood remain closed
for the winter, the Pitt
soccer team continues its
roller coaster ride through
the season as it fell to Robert
Morris 3-0, lowering its
season record to 5-8-2.

After knocking off top-
seeded Big East
powerhouse Boston
College on Sunday, BC’s
first home loss in over 14
games, the Panthers
returned home to face the
Robert Morris Colonials to
begin a three-game home
stand. 1

The game started off in a
frenzy as both teams played
a wide-open game and
volleyed the ball back and
forth, often settling for
weak shots over powerful
set plays. Pitt's Carsten
Bishop set up Brian
Hammond on a nice pass,
but Hammond was unable
to Convert.

The Colonials broke
through at 8 minutes and
15 seconds of the first half
as midfielder Troy Fabiano
took a direct kick and
blasted the ball near the
Pitt net. A Robert Morris
freshman then smashed a
shot from the 15- yard line.
The ball went sailing into
the Pitt net past a diving
Jay Kapusta who put in a
good effort only to come
up empty.

Minutes later, Pitt senior
Nick Liberati ﬂoated a ball
through the Robert Morris
goal box, but the Panthers
could not find it, and
another scoring
opportunity was laid to rest.
Late in the half Pitt
sophomore Huy Tran
slammed a bullet from 10
yards out, but was denied
a goal by a brilliant play by
Robert '3 Morris goalkeeper
Doug Petras.

In the waning moments
of the half, Pitt had a direct
shot from inside 20 yards,
but it produced nothing.

Just minutes into the
second half, Robert Morris
forward Roman Kuropas
lofted a shot at the Pitt goal
but a goal was avoided
when goalkeeper Kapusta
made a strong play to
knock it away from the
goal mouth.

Pitt continued to shoot
but could not convert on
anything. Good efforts by
freshmen Erik Duffy and
Don Overmier were lost as
Petras came up strong
again.

Notre Dame has a better

Stopping tbe ‘Roe/eet’ will be a /9z'g/9-octane tas/efor defense

By Doug Miller‘
sum‘ Writer

It’s been said to the point where
it‘ has become trite. Numerous
national sports publications have
him on their covers. Accolades
have rung from all corners of the
country; he is one of this year's
leading Heisman Trophy
candidates. “He” is Raghib
“Rocket” Ismail.

He is Notre Dame’s do-it—all
offensive weapon. His speed is
like that of a, well, you know, a
rocket. He welcomed Miami last
Saturday in South Bend with a
kickoff return for 94 yards.

Enough said.

Granted he is just one player,
but oh what a player he is! “What
can you say about him? He’s the
best football player in the
cou ntry, ” said Fighting Irish coach
Lou Holtz.

In the only game ND has lost
this year (against Stanford), the
Rocket didn’t play because of an

injury. Coincidence? Doubtful.

So how do the Panthers View
the one-man wrecking crew?
Senior defensive back Louis
Riddick has played against the
Rocket twice while at Pitt and ran
against him in high school at a
track meet.

Riddick said, “Rocket is even
better than everyone says he is.
His speed is something you see
on TV and say ‘wow,’ but until
you face him on the field, you
can’t comprehend the things he
can do.”

Panther linebacker Prentiss
Wright claimed, “The man is
awesome. He has bursting speed;
he is unbelievable.”

But the best player in the
country, Prentiss? “He is one of
the truly great ones. When people
say he’s the best, I will not argue
with them one bit.”

How the Panthers will defend
the Irish and the Rocket shall be
interesting. “You have to make
some allowances for Rocket’s
speed,” said Riddick. “But you
have to play him like any other
player because the moment you
key too much on him, ND will kill

you in other areas.”

Said Wright, “We are going to
try and contaih him, but more
importantly, we're going to go
out and play hard. That's our
game plan — to get after him.”

If the Panthers hope to pull a
major upset, they will need a few
breaks and a little luck, as well as
an inspired defense. Wright
doesn’t think that will be a
problem.

“If we can’t get pumped up
about Notre Dame, then we
should all be shot. But we also
really need our crowd. They could
play a major factor in this game.”

Wright will have more than his
skills to try and stop the tailback/
wide receiver/punt returner/
kickoff specialist. After all, Prentiss
is bringing his arsenal of
motivational signals to the big
game.

“You are going to see the ‘bone’

Also, I’m going with the fingers

fans will get the ‘salute.’”

This game has great signiﬁcance
to the seniors on this Pitt team.
They have the chance to show
the nation that they are indeed a
quality team.

They also feel the key to
shutting down the Notre Dame
team starts with the Rocket.

They don’t need 95- or 100-’
yard returns from the Rocket for
his introduction, just a special-
teams hit that lets him know the
Panthers came to play. Pitt might
live by shutting down the Rocket,
or it might die by not doing so.

Continued from page P-2
he may get his first start of the
year on Saturday due to an injury
to Andre Jones. Last year Devon
had 34 tackles and started four
games for the 12-1 Irish, but was
hampered with knee injuries.

Devon, however, is one up on
his brother in college also +
Notre Dame won the national

championship in 1988, although I

Devon didn’t see any action as a
freshman.

“I’d say he’s got the advantage
over me right now,” said Ricardo.
“Just about everyone wants to
win a national championship at
one time in their lives.”

Ricardo won't get that chance
this year, but Devon and
teammates are inching their way
toward that goal again. The Irish
enter the game ranked No. 3 in
the country and as 12-1/2 point
favorites over the Panthers.

PITI‘ BITS: Devon may have
won the state championship at
Kennedy High, but Ricardo got
to be a movie star at Eastside. The
movie “Lean On Me” was based
on former Eastside principal Joe

Clark, and Ricardo got a bit part ,

playing a street bum.

Soccer

Continued from page P-9

‘ pressuring again in the middle of

the half and capitalized on a
misplay in the Pitt zone. At 21:13,
Colonial midﬁelder Ernesto Pitt
dribbled past two Panther
defenders and knocked a shot
from close in to give Robert Morris

\ a 2-0 lead.

Shortly thereafter, Panther
midﬁelder senior Ivan Amayo was
robbed by Petras at point blank
as he continued his march toward
a shutout.

Another blow to the Panthers
game was the costly loss of
defenseman Brian Pelligrino at
7:14. Pelligrino was taken down
hard by a Robert Morris midfielder
and had to be helped off the
field.

Pe.ligrino’s sprained ankle
could prove to be devastating as
he has started throughout the
entire season and has been a key
to the Pittsburgh defensive corps.

From this point on, the game

\ broke into a wide-open volley.

With under two minutes left, the
Colonials were still looking to
add another goal, and their wish

came true as two Robert Morris
forwards broke out into a two-
on-one situation with only
defender Roberto Croce back for
Pitt. —

Kapusta came 10 yards out to
help out on defense, but the
Robert Morris player was quick
to complete the fast break and
loft the ball over Kapusta’s head
into the goal, finishing the scoring
at 3-0.

After the game Panther coach
Joe Luxbacher was disappointed
in the outcome as he discussed

the key factors in the loss. “We .

didn’t score, and we just didn’t
play well,” said Luxbacher. “Our
guys played hard, but we really
couldn’t score. We always have
trouble with [Robert Morris];
they’re a strong team. They beat
West Virginia this year, but they
didn’t outplay us. They had their
chances, and we had ours.”
PIITBITS: . Pitt has two games
left this season, both at home.
The Panthers play Sunday against

Big East rival Syracuse and against ;

Grove City on Wednesday night
at 7:15.
