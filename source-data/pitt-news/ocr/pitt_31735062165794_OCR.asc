Money to Students

Student Government has returned_ all but $100 of the
$2,600 thatit took in at the winter book ‘exchange.

Thirty-ﬁve students failed to claim books or money,
even though SG had designated three days for student claims.

These students may contact Beverly Reifman atex. 7894 and‘.

then pick up their books or money at 325 SU before Feb. 20.
This semester’s book exchange’  '

sold 896 of the 1100 books that
they took in, 300 more than were
sold last semester. L
Publicity chairman of SG, Bev-
erly Reifman, deemed the ex-
change “very successful. I think
that there is a definite need for a
book exchange since there is no
other way for students to
books. at reasonable prices.”
“This last boox exchange was

Discrimination
Policies Told

The office of Chancellor
Litchﬁeld released the Uni-
versity’s, policy on discrimina-

tion today. The three-para-
. graph policy paper states that ,

the University “affirms its op-

position to policies which tend to
deprive any individual of a right
or, a privilege solely‘ because of
race, religion, or national origin.”

Further, the University “has
not and will not” discriminate in
any matter including employment,
student selection, and housing.”
Nor will it “condone such dis-
crimination in other organizations
with which it has continuing re-
lationships.” . » .

No Affiliation _

The discrimination policy goes
on to say, “The University will
not affiliate with, nor extend re-
cognition ‘to any group or associa-
tion” with discriminatory policies.
Such organizations must eliminate
their discriminatory policies by
January 1, 1965, ‘or “afﬁliation will
be terminated by the University.”

-A limited extension of the
deadline may be granted in the
case of local branches of na-
tional organizations if’ there is
evidence of serious effort to eli-
'minate discriminatory clauses
from organization charters.

The original resolution, adopted

as policy for the School of Medi— '

cine by the faculty,_was primarily
concerned with curbing official
University meetings —in private
clubs which’ make 3 practice of
discrimination.‘

Suggestion ‘from M.D.

representative from the
School of Medicine suggested
more than a yearago that the
University issue a statement, on
discrimination. As a result, Litch-
ﬁeld had each division of the Uni-

versity poll its faculty to propose-

a resolution. Then, the suggestions
were debated in the Senate Coun-
cil and the Council of University
Deans. '

Formal action by the board of
trustees was ‘not necessary to
institute the policy, however.‘

“I came from New York City to

Journalist Talks on Peace

PEACEMAKER Milton Mayer,

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

i_ It is a human crisis, not an
East-West, Cuban, or Berlin
crisis, that undermines world
peace, so said author-journal-
Monday
afternoon in his Midday series
lecture, “The Price of Peace.”
“Just nine score and seven
‘ paraphrased Mayer,
“our, fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation, dedicated
to the fanatical proposition that
-' people could govern themselves
and that no man was ﬁt to govern
, another.”
‘ American Model
Mayer pointed out that there
is no. advance society today, in-
cluding Communism, which has

\not taken the American proposi-

“ tion as a model.
But where this proposition
has taken us is what Mayer
.wants to know. According to

‘ For Students

chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeldl
. announced at the faculty senate

' meeting Friday that there will
j be 65 apartments available next
4 fall for married students.

The _apartments, which will be
rented at less than .commercial
rates, are efﬁciencies with one
bedroom. They are located in "two
buildings within walking distance
of the campus.

Cigarette smoking on campus
was also discussed by the senate.

' A committee, formed to look into
the existing rules about smoking
in certain areas, such as the
Commons ‘Room, will formulate a
deﬁnite code for those who wish
to enforce it.

Dr. John Geise, vice-chancellor
‘for regional programs, spoke
about the regional campuses. He
stated that closed circuit tele-
vision from the University’s Oak-
land campus may be used to in-
, struct classes at the local cam-
puses.
It was also reported that in
September, 1963, the University
will pay a maximum of 75 per-

 cent of the tuition of faculty mem-

bers’ children attending other col-
. leges.

discusses the
nature of peace ‘and man’s quest for it at the

him, we are “carried from crisis
to crisis in which our role is
that of the helpless spectator or
the helpless accomplice in a
crude deceit.”

The ideal of national security
does not serve, brought out Mayer,
to distinguish America from any
other nation. In this ideal a para-
dox is apparent: the “closer” we
approach to absolute security, the
more we feel absolutely insecure.”
‘ Science is the Method V

He went'on to explain that “the
Lord told Jeremiah that his people
were wise to do evil, but to do
good they have no knowledge.
This has not changed. But, be-
cause of science, we can now do
that mischief that we had in our
hearts.” _ '

He went on to urgeeveryone
_1to - forget_ about Communism
when searching for" the evils'in
the world. Although the Com-
munists have done “everything
that is wicked, they did not in-
vlent any of it.”

Administration

coffee hour. The Midday speaker stressed that

Mayer affirmed that man has
“perfect ‘freedom to choose" be-
tween God and Mammon.” He later
stated that the “Communists ac’-
cept Mammon with their whole
heart and an easy -conscience.
They have rejected God. But in
the end, they will flood the world
with blood, just as we have al-
ways done before them.” V

Awareness Necessary

“Awareness of our own Situa-
tion is necessary to combat the
human crisis,” observed Mayer.
“The ‘Price of ‘Peace’ is high, it
is getting higher all the time. It
has not been going down for a
long time. It has to be paid, not
by somebody’s_ government, but by
somebody.’ By everyone of us ev-
ery day of our lives.

The ‘Price Of Peace’ is peace-
‘ableness V Peace is. always
unilateral. Multilateral peace is
nothing but a truce. He who

would have peace must ‘make

peace.”

Group Plans

Job Assistance Programs

The Social Security Adminis-
tration presently is planning its‘
1963 Student Assistant Program,
to provide employment for a lim-
ited number of students inter-
ested in a career with the Admin-
istration after graduation.

Applications are limited to stu-
dents who have completed their
junior year, preferably with a “B”
average, and who have passed the",
Federal Service Entrance "Exam-
ination. _ -

Acquaint With Administration

Through participation in the
Student Assistant‘ Program, the
student may acquaint himself
with various aspects of the Ad-
ministration. Last summer 24 Stu-
dent Assistants from 11 colleges
were employed in such ﬁelds as
social insurance research, statis-
tical analysis, correspondence
management analysis, journalism,’
public information, telecommuni-
cations, forms and records man-,
agement, personnel administra-,
tion, printing management, and
employee development. 4

area is satisfactory, the Ad-

ministration will offer him a

ranging from rock and roll too
some of the better compositions of
our modern day song writers.

Inoffensive Performance

And the beauty of the entire
performance was that they pre-
sented those selections in a man-
ner inoffensive to the ear. They
didn’t reek of self-importance as

insulted a much larger crowd a

few months [ago at the Syria

Mosque. Instead, they displayed

the knowledge by their perform-

ance that.the main function of any

group is to entertain. -And" -that

they did well. ,

' Although many of the Greeks
seemed at first ignorant of ‘the
groups particular style of sing-
ing, the show had‘ not progress-
ed very far till the brothers
and sisters 'were throughly en-
joying every gag and new selec-
tion.  ,

All the members of the group
were not equally‘ versed in the
use of their accompanying ‘instru-
ments but what. was lost in the
instrumentation was regained with
interest in the vocal presentations.

“Act Three”

Bill ‘Comstock’s, solo" versions of
his “Act Three” and “Blue In The
Night” made up for Bob Flami-
gan’s meager talents on the trum-
pet and trombone, and the group’s
combined voices helped ‘to* play
down the somewhat humorous
appearing attempts of Ken Albers
to play the trumpet’ and string
base at the ‘same time.‘

If. the comic interludes -
staged by Flanigan were
often too long and not really
worth the _effort, the superb
vocal ‘rendition of Ellington’s
“Theme from, Anatomy of a
Murder” . was I a sheer delight
and an acceptable compensation.

Onsthe whole, the program was
a skillful~blending- of humor, song
parody. and ﬁne vocal interpreta-
tions which could be described in

Review of J. D. Sali.ng'er’s New Stories

When old J. D. Salinger
takes two more of his long

the New Yorker -and, you
know, puts them in hardcover
as he is prone to do,'like for
instance Raise High the Roof

that old Jerome David has done
it again.

Well then, after that, you like
to say, Jesus, it’s nice to see he’s
still writing about the Glass
family, and it is——it really is——
because they’re a heck of a lot
of fun to read about even though
some of the Glasses are cracked;
but that really isn’t for us to de-
cide anyway, because Salinger
hasn’t either, for that matter.

Well, anyway, he’s done it
again and while these stories are
great fun to ' read—almost as

inuch as they are to write, if

T little To Say

' _ ner, Fred’ Iylarjeus, ‘ Frank, Smizik,.Marv lzelkowitz.

Little need be said about the University’s plain and
sim.ple statement of policy on alcohol on campus. -
And the administration seems to agree that llttleineeds

to be said. In outlining the future dryness of the school,

they obviously did not feel that it was even, necessary to
refer to the Student Government—student body alcohol

‘proposal ‘which brought the issue to their attention in the

first place. Their policy is direct and seeminglyoblivious to

the pleas of the carefully-drawn, strongly supported alco-~-

hol bill. Over-21 graduate students may imbibe on certain,
to-be—announced occasions, but for the main, the situation
remains the same.

Little need be said.

A Bad’ cap 2

Officer Irie “Ira” Palmer, who died one week ago today,
was recently described by University Police Chief Charles
Ray as “an awfully good man.” Many on campus echoed

' that belief.

But was Palmer a good cop? By his own admission, he
never tagged a student’s car for illegal parking ‘in all his
time at the University. g

“You kids have to pay so much to go to college any-

~way,” he conﬁded one night in The Pitt. News editorial

oﬁice, “I just can’t let you pay for parking in the wrong
place.” in ‘

Wasghe also a bad cop because he never reported that
students were having midnight snacks delivered in the dor-
mitories? Was he also a bad cop because he somehow man-
aged to overlook pets being illegally housed in the dorm?
And was he a bad cop because he would stop in his rounds
and chat with students for the simple reason:«“I like young
people.”? I

We suppose he may have been a bad cop for many

reasons. But he was an awfully good man.

Where Cramming Is Good...

Mania  

“Bridge — a card game for two pairs of players
in which they bid for the right to name the trump
suit or declare no-trump.” So says Webster’s New
World Dictionary of, the "American Language about
one of the most popular card games‘ on college
campuses throughout America. As any avid bridge
player—college student knows, however, the game
entails a great deal more than Webster included
in his definition.

To learn the ﬁne points of the game requires a
high degree of concentration. So much concentra-
tion, in fact, that bridge quite, often takes a student,
away from hisstudies completely. These’ he leaves
without the tiniestlfeeling of guilt, of course, and
if he isn’t very 'careful,’he may never get away
from the ‘bridge table and back to the-books.

Bridge seems to have some mysterious drawing
power which no. red-blooded, American, bridge-
playing college student (even if he is only slightly
acquainted withits intricacies) can resist. If the
Ace of Spades gave off an- exotic odor of solne an-
cient apothecary’s potion for hypnotizing man, the
effectwould not be any stronger. Actually, players‘
on their way to‘ the card table oftendo look as if
they are following just such an enticing scent. Nose
andgheadforward, they stalk to the table with little
regard for life surrounding them. The lure of 52
small rectangular pieces of paper or plastic is
amazing. In fact, it’s almost fantastic!

The Slabbed and Homeless

According to a carefully investigated source.
one college student was so intent upon getting to
his bridge ‘game that he turned right where he
should have turned left and fell three floors to
the stone slabs of the Commons,Room. That was’
one of the more stirring cases, to be sure, but I’ve
included it to prove the drawing powers of bridge.
Another hapless student, it has been reported,
rushed out of his house so eager to get to a bridge

'party that he didn’t even notice the ﬂames starting

to leap from the eaves of the house. Needless, to
say, he returned to a pile of ashes and bricks,’quite
astonished and determined to give up bridge for-
ever. When last seen, however, he was still play-
ing bl'_i_dge and was living at the YMCA. ’

————Lure of the 52's.;:

‘By Kathy Edwards

At the scene of play, an atmosphere of rugged
determination sets in. ,The players are out to win,
regardless of the cost. I realize that this happens
in most card games, but in bridge the determina-
tion seems to be more intense, the action more
calculated and hardboiled.

/A player may ﬂunk his accounting course be-.9
cause of it, or he may miss an important club meet-
ing and ﬁnd out later that he has been elected

secretary, treasurer, and historian of the organiza-

tion in' his absence. Does this bother the true,
dye_d—in—the-wool bridge player? Of course not. He

' simply decides to change his major; or, in the sec-

.ond case, institutes "bridge playing as a regular part
of the club's activities and eventually changes it

"from a butterﬂy collecting club to a bridge club.

Glee. Gloom. and Triumph
It may appear that I’m exaggerating, but I’ve
watched many bridge players, and ﬁery glee can be

.seen to spring into their eyes when the opponent

\\V

v

makes even a slight mistake; a heavy veil, of gloom .

can be seen to descend upon them when it’s _their_
own mistake and they go’ down three tricks,
doubled and vulnerable. A look of absolute tri-
umph and mastery can be seen to settle comfort-
ably over- the features of the ,winners at the end
of a ‘long. and tension-‘producing bridge session.
Since the word tension seems tohave crept in,

perhaps I should say a few words in defense of

“bl‘idge—tension.” Actually, bridge acts to relieve

_the tensions built up by everyday problems; ten-

sion-producing problems such as a lost assignment

notebook, a lost parakeet, or even a lost love.
Bridge brings on another kind of tension, how-

ever. This is the kind of tension which produces

beads _of persppiration which trickle down a player’s

nose and land with a small splash on the unpro-
tected" cards, or, in a more severe form, ringing in
the ears and a slight blurring of vision may de-
velop. Bridge tension may even cause that “ache
all over, feverish feeling”,commonly a_ttributed to

the common cold. All of these could be endured

by the faithful*bridge'followerlif there were only a

cure for it. Unfortunately, the only thing which

givesgany relief is another‘ bridge game, a-nd that
starts the Vicious cycle all over again.

   

uother~.e1sses attended--1  -i

Eclu»ca,fion.Race

The most frequent comment made by students
who are asked to join extra-curricular activities is

' that they would like to but don't have the time.

'l‘hi_s<may be considered a corny excuse on some‘.
campuses, but at this university - _ '
it is, unfortunately, a completely
valid statement;- The reason i:
the trimester system which, ‘'1
its‘ present form, is not a ste}"
forward in American education.

The trimester system is a
symptom of an unfortunate trend
in American society: we are
pushing ourselves faster and ,
faster, attempting to accomplisl
more and more in less time.
Criticism of this way of life has ' ,
included the observation that, while. the highly
educated members of our society are devising and

 

working with the complex mechanisms of 20th

century civilization, the less-educated have become
little more than janitors for technology. V
Adapt to Shgllowness '

Craftsmanship in the manual arts is fast evapo-

-ating as our mass—production, throw-away culture
continues to develop. This type of pace will be
easy for the student to adapt to if hehas “gone
trimester.” It would seem, however, that we should
not just accept this shallow pace of life, but that
we have the responsibility to consciously attempt to
mold our culture. -

The rapid pace of, the trimester leaves little or
no room for study: cramming is the god of the
trimester, and it leads to a superficial brand of
"liberal education. If a student attempts to do
nothing but study, then he will miss the varied
extra-curricular activities which, when indulged
in moderately, should form a Very important part
of his education. Every trimester teachers pass out
lists of extra reading. In the trimester system extra
reading is impossible unless one is willingto
jeopardize any _outside interests or the tlr_i_ree.o1‘.,four

’ all.

 
 

 

/By Barry Cross

\

The University" has provided its undergraduates
with ‘intellectual and social‘ activities galore, but

.not the time‘ for'them to be enjoyed. Too often

this rapid, shallow pace we undertake-through
eight trimesters of undergraduate work leaves us
no time for real comprehension or argumentation
or discussion. There are blocks of data and opin-
ions confronting us which must be‘ learned and_
parroted back or ‘superﬁcially manipulated.

What student "will write. to the adrninistration.
requesting that he be allowed to take Silence I and

‘ II — as suggested by Professor Peterson? This is

the rocket-fast age, the time to rush and cram and
skim, but not to contemplate, for some inlvisible
phantom’ seems.to be urging us to step up the pace.
Ou+ Before You Know ‘ ‘

‘ The trimester’s advantages, we have been told,

, are based upon gettingmore students through more
education in less time. ‘ You can train more doctors

and more engineers more quickly. If “you? have to
work for tuition, you can, go to school "for two tri-
mesters and work for’ the third. ‘Under-the tri-
mester system you can be through with college be-

‘fore you know what has "happened to you during

the past two and two-thirds years, or before you
know much ‘of anything. ’
Could the trimester. work to the student’s ad-
vantage? What happens to the student with both
time and money ‘who elects to’ spread two tri-
mesters worth ofcredits over three trimesters? He
might have time to study rather than to cram,
time for extra-curricular activities, and time to
take Silence I and II_. When‘ the Student Govern-
ment survey on the‘ trimester is com.plete, will a
student be found who has done this? Is education
to be a race or a contemplative learning experience?

posed" upon him, attending college under the tri-

LETTERS 0 THE EDITOR

Insight Not Found

in Heinzerling Talk ‘

Editor, The Pitt News:

With reference to Miss Nancy

Fuchs’ article “AP Expert Dis-
cusses Africa” of February 4,.I
would like to point out some

misrepresentations as given by’

Mr. Heinzerling. .

While Mr. Heinzerling might
have spent more than a few
months A in Africa and might
have been able ‘Ito know the
numberof newly independent
nations in that continent, his
speech as published in The Pitt
News did not show any’ insight
on his part into the problems
of Africa as such to warrant
him the name of “an expert on
Africa”. ’

Apart from theifact that there
is nothing new in his presenta-
tion, I will point to some speciﬁc
examples in his "speech which
showed lack of understanding or
oversimpliﬁcation on his part
concerning the problems of Af-
rica. S

First he gave the average an-
nual earning of an individual in
Nigeria as $85.00 and that of the
United States as $2400.00. I
would like toppoint out that the
two ﬁgures are not comparable
as_ inferred since the samplings
are not of similar types.

"Even the government of_ Ni-
geria can know the earnings of
only very few people apart from
the wage earners whose number
is insigniﬁcant when compared
with the whole population.
Moreover, the’ bulk » of these
wage earners in Nigeria are la-
borers and unskilled workers.

And since Nigeria is primarily
an agricultural nation, most
people do not need to spend

V money onifood but instead live

on theirrproducts. Whereas in
the United States, it is possible
to collect the same ‘information
without much difﬁculty since the

_' bulk of the population are xyvage

earners. .
Second, Mr. Heinzerling in-

ferred that "the problems of the‘

Congo, are due, in large part,
to the many languages of that
nation-. While language differ-
ences may have some bearing
in this situation, it does not ex-
plain why iMr. Tshombe decided
to give up his autonomy after
the withdrawal of British and
Belgian support from him.‘
‘Third, Mr. Heinzerling said
that the reason why the black

1. Africans of South Africa do, not
revolt against "the injustice done,

to them is because they know
they are not ready for self rule.

Perhaps Mr. Heinzerling’s
deﬁnition for \readiness for self
rule will throw more light on
his view point but with this
question in mind as when he
deﬁnes his terms: “Is readiness
for independence based on per-

centage of nation or is it based

on the ability to collect sizable
firearms to defend one self
against inhuman massacre of the
innocents?"

As to literacy rate, South Af-
fica has the highest in Africa
south of the. Sahara. As to the
second part -of the question, I
wou1d.like to point to the inci-
dent. of the Aparthied Massacre
of the Innocents in the spring
of 1960, and also to the develop-
ment in that part of the contin-
ent where the whites have been
hoarding ﬁrearms but making it
illegal for the blacks to own any.

Foreign Students Tell

Of Organizations Plans
Editor, The Pitt News: '
In a recent news article, your
newspaper correctly r e p o r t -
’ ed that a Foreign Student Or-
ganization was formed on Jan-
uary 6, 1963 at a duly consti-
tuted meeting under the chair-

manship of C. Scott Kelly, as-
sistant director of the Office of
-Cultural and Educational Ex-
change.

As representative of the pro-
visional executive‘ committee, we
have been instructed to inform
the University community that
the said committee has been
working on a constitution and
bylaws which shall be forwarded
to all prospective members at an
early date. ' -

We also wish to inform mem-
bers and friends of the Univer-
sity _that this organization shall
eventually seek out all organiza-
tions and individuals who_ have
contributed signiﬁcantly to the
welfare of foreign students at
the University.

We will co—operate with them
and all other interested parties
in formulating and implement-
ing programs and series which

will contribute to the overall‘

_ understanding. between foreign
students and Americans.

lVIusic School at Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology, and Vladi-
mir Spolsky of the University’s

tation, 15% for the relation to

the theme, and 15% for cos-

tumes.

“We were really thrilled. We
worked hard and enjoyed every

The Panther Cubs travel to

_West Virginia tonight in an

attempt to avenge their ear-
lier 82-64 loss to the Little
Mountaineers.

Coach Carl Peterson’s

charges will take a 4-2 record
with them to'Mountaineer Field
House, including wins over the
Duquesne Frosh and Johnstown
College. ‘

Bill‘ Ryczaj, who scored 19
points for the Mounties in the
initial encounter, failed to im-
press. the Cub’s starting center,
Bob Lovette. “I was kind of dis-
appointed in him,” the _six-foot-
ﬁve freshman explained. “I
thought he’d be hitting a lot
around’ the keyhole.”

Big Business 1

The Cubs played last Friday
night at the Civic Arena, and de-
feated Robert Morris Business
School in overtime, 75-67.

The Cubs were down by 38-22
but battled back to attain a 59-
58 lead on a ﬁeld goal by Nick
Generalovich, but the score was
tied, 66-66, at the buzzer.

The Cubs, sparked by Lovette’s
four points in the overtime pe-
riod, outscored Robert Morris 9-1.

Teddy Lazzaro scored 10 points,
all in the second half, and Lo-
vette hit 23 after a three point
ﬁrst half, to leadthe Cubs.

“We should have beaten them
last time,” Lovette said of the
game with the Little Mountain-
eers. “We had them tied (56-56)
with ﬁve minutes to go. lt’s a
game ‘everyone on the team r-rally
wnts to win. They’re not so
tough.” '

Grace Hall, the antiquated
home of Llehigh’s wrestling
team, will be ﬁlled to capa-
city Saturday night as the
Engineers host their No. 1

, rival ’ at Bethlehem, Pa.

Thelmatch won’t have the sig-

nificance of the past two years
when the teams -were battling for
Eastern supremacy, ‘but there is
nothing Lehigh enjoys more than
beating Pitt.

Both Pitt and Lehigh had their
troubles early in "the year, but-
each has come on strong with Le-
high taking their -last ﬁve and
the Panthers, their last three.

Down Year

Lehigh is not as powerful as
they have been in recent years,
even though they have three de-
fending Eastern champions on the
team: Bill Merriam, 123-pounds,
Pat Smartt, 130-pounds, and Kirk
Pendleton, 157-pounds.

Fifth Triumph Ag

ains

Pendleton is the only unde-
feated wrestler on the squad.
Merriam and Smartt have not
been "up to their form of last
year. Merriam lost early in the
year to Syracuse’s Terry Haise
and Smartt lost to Bethel
Greenhalgh of Syracuse am‘. Jim
'Mel'drim of Cornell. ’_

Smartt missed three matches
due. to injury, but has won his last
two outings since returning.

, Jinx Over Visiting Panthers

By ART FLEISCHNER
West Virginia will try and make it 14 wins in a row over
the visiting Panthers tonight, while Bob Timmons’ club will
try and reverse a 68-67 decision of two Weeks ago. A L

Since that timenthe Panthers have defeated Fordham’

and Westminster to boost their record to 14-4. West Virginia
defeated’ VPI, but lost to William  Mary, 75-72, this past

Saturday,
total to 15-6. Radio station WPGH.
(650) will broadcast the game
action beginning at 7:45 p.m.
West Virginia football coach Gene
Corum will be interviewed at
half-time. '

‘Earlier this year the Panthers
defeated William & Mary, 66-55,
in the opening round of the Steel
Bowl.

Deserved Win

Although the basketball team
rallied from a 16- point deﬁcit
against West Virginia, many of
the players felt they deserved to
win. Students and fans alike
thought that after six years of
frustration, the Panthers had ﬁn-
ally defeated the Mountaineers.

The unsuccessful attempt at
home leads foreshadows that
the Panthers will not be any
more successful at Morgantown,
where visitors seldom win.

The heralded dual between Rod
Thorn and Brian Generalovich
two weeks ago never materialized.
Both had 14 points, ten points be-
low Thorn’s average and two be-
low the General’s. After the WVU
loss, Coach Timmons said, “Our
guards did a good job on Thorn
and McCormick. It was Mike

Squashmen Seek
Year’s Only Win
Against Dickinson

The squash team has one more
chance to salvage a win as a
weak Dickinson team visits Fitz-
gerald Field House on Saturday.
Until now the Panthers have met
only top competition and have
compiled an 0-4 record.

The latest defeat came at the
‘hands of a powerful Navy team

last Saturday. The home court
proved no advantage as the
Panthers lost 8-1.

As usual the only bright spot
for the losers was a win by Dave
O’Loughlin. O’Loughlin defeated
Lee Pekary, number one man -for
"the Midshipmen, 15-5, 15-10, 15-6.

According to Coach Ben Pope,
the Dickinson team is more on
his team’s level than the other
teams they have met. “This is
the only meet we hav had a

chance to win so far this sea-

that hurt us.”
Notes Lowry
Timmons continued, “That
Lowry kid played tough ball.” The
Lowry kid Timmons was" talking
about was 6-8 j.unior center Tom
Lowry who scored 18 points, in-
cluding a 15-foot set-shot with
nine seconds left that won the
game. A
' In the three games since the
WVU loss, Coach Timmons has
made some changes. He has
started Tim Grgurich the last
two games and left Cal Sheffield
to sit quietly on the bench.
While this has hurt the Panther
offensive punch, it has, according
to Timmons, “strengthened our
ballclub. with Grgurich and Ro-
man in the backcourt. The team
has been winning with Tim in
there and I’ll go along with him
for a while. '
Covers Thorn
“He did a good job on Thorn
the last time and he’ll probably
cover him again.” A ‘
Another factor which has
shown up in the last three
games is the increasingly better
play of Dave Sauer. Against the
Mountaineers Sauer had eight
points. He followed -this ‘ with
ten against Fordham and had
12 ‘against Westminster. . -
Against Westminster, D a r y 1 e
Ruby replaced Paul Krieger and
scored ten points. Timmons had
been using John Maczuzak in
place of Krieger, but against the
Titans he gave Ruby a chance and
the 6-4 sophomore responded. ‘
Following the visit to West Vir-
ginia, the Panthers will host
Bucknell at the Field House on
Saturday. Last year the host team
defeated the Bisons, '70-60.

“It Goes On..."

Jim C)’Brien

Sports Editor

. AH, SUCCESS
Order should be restored in basketball circles in Pitts-
burgh in two years. Duquesne University should be No. 1 by
then‘ and Carnegie Tech’ will be scrambling with Pitt for

the runner-up spot.

Don’t guffaws at the arrival of a Bucknell basketball team
here Saturday night. Don’t miss the game. Especially if you
enjoy seeing the Panthers‘ trounce teams. The feast may soon

turn to famine.

We are on top right now in basketball because three
years ago our coaches struck it rich. They enticed Brian
Generalovich, Paul Krieger, Cal Sheffield and Dave Sauer to
further their education here. I’m convinced it was prospec-

tor’s, luck.
Real Salesmen
I’ve seen them, in action

trying to recruit high. school

prospects and I really wondgerwhether they could even ped-

dle B—rrirls on a troop train.

The othe.r night in the Civic Arena (fortunately, most
of the fans hadn_’t ﬁled in yet to see the fiasco) the frosh
team was down 38-22 to Robert Morris Business School, a

surging basketball power

west of the Alleghenies,

(record 3-12')", behind the County Jail. .

The Panther teamrallied, however, and‘ won in over-
time, 75-67. Carl Peterson simply outcoached Robert Morris’s
young mentor. Peterson had become outraged when he was
cited for a technical foul for obvious m-isconduct on the side-
line. Even his aide, John Fridley was cautioned to still a

stinging tongue.

Peterson proved that he is eyery bit as good a coach as
Bob Timmons. The Cubs brought the ball in bounds with the
score tied 66-66 and called time out with three seconds left-
remember the V\7est Virginia varsity game? -

_ The Cubs didn’t score either even though no one called

time out.

The following night‘ the junior varsitywas playing the
Westminster JV’s at the Field -House. Jayvee teams are clubs

designed to keep recruiting mistakes in deep—freeze.

The

‘Peterson-coached cagers blew a 17-point lead and lost to the
visitors. 45-43, in sudden death overtime.
Their prize-pick had 11 points in this game. ‘He’s a
little taller than Tom Thumb. A kid they went all the
way to New Jersey to recruit‘ had six, (his all-time_
high) four over his normal game average. Their ace-
from Wilkinsburg was shut out.
Meanwhile there is not one sophomore who can be trust-.
ed for more than ﬁve minutes on the varsity. Daryle Ruby
might havebeen able to do the jobhad he not played for the

freshman team last year.

. The company joke on ‘the greatness of junior guard Dave
Roman, the transfer from Johnstown College, is that he
never had the advantage of playing on the freshman team

here.

But it is of such stalwart men that the stuffings of a
good basketball team are never made’. It was nice while it

lasted. ~

Maryland Tankers

Toughest Opponent

For Grad_v’s. Men

Maryland hosts the Pan-
ther swimming team at Col-
lege Park at 2 p.m. today,

_hoping to bust their visitor’s_

enviable 7-0 record. The Ter-
rapins are definitely
the roughest opposition the Pan-
thers will face all season. ,

The roadblocks to a possible
unbeaten season posted an out-
standing 11-1 mark last winter.
They were champions of the At-
lantic Coast Conference for the
third straight year, edging" North
Carolina and North Carolina State
for the honors.

They have fourteen lettermen
and the products of~an undefeated
freshman team. The only dual
meet loss for the Maryland nata-
tors in 1961-62 came at the hands
of arch—rival Navy. The Terrapins
avenged that loss earlier this year,
62-33. -

Calls -Close Meet

West Virginia coach Jim Mark;
el, whose team bowed here 71-24,
produced a note of confidence:
“Pitt has an excellent team. If
anyone can beat Maryland, Be

Coach Carl Reestakes his
varsity and freshman track
teams to Annapolis this week-
end, where the Panthers meet
Navy and Annapolis in an in-
door triangular meet.

The thinclads posted a 79-44 vic-
tory over Slippery Rock last Sat-
urday, including ﬁrsts in the 440
yard dash, 65-yard high hurdles,
and a sweep of the pole vault.

“I was disappointed in ’(Bob)
Henry and (Jim) Studnicki in the
880~yard run. They made mental

mistakes,” Rees explained. “They
let Slippery Rock get ahead of
them and couldn’t catch up.”
Not Deserving

When miler Larry Robinson,
who ﬁnished second behind Slip-
pery Rock’s Waldorf, asked Coach
Rees for meal money, the runner
lamented, "‘I don’t deserve ‘* my
supper money.”

Navy, -who defeatef Penn
State, 77-32, last week, has a
lot of depth, according to Rees.
“They dress 60 to 70 men for a
meet. That way they can come
back with freshmen in all A
events. That’s a big factor.”

Maryland has a strong team,
too. “I know that they have a
16-foot pole vaulter,” Rees ex-
plained. Ron Weirers won the
pole vault event at Slippery Rock
with a 12-4 vault.

“I also know that they have
good 600 yard and 1,000 yard
_runners,” Rees explained. “They
also have a boy named Van
Keenan who is a good sprinter.”

The Terrapins aren’t a team the
trackmen are likely to forget.
Two years ago Marylanddrubbed
Rees’s athletes 104-27 in an out-
door meet. '

“We’re real strong in ' the-

In spite of the dismal sea-

point wherehe is No. 1 on the

work on the still rings. V ,
Originally Jack came here as a

Switched Specialty
Coach Neiger suggested
horse vaulting and Lehner quick-
ly picked it up. His diving ability,
which he developed in high
school, has helped him consider-
ably on the tricky and compli-
cated vaults required on the long
horse. _

Soft Touch Hoopster
Leads ‘Cubs in Scoring,
But Has F oulTrouble
By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ
Robert G. Lovette is a gang-

,-_é§1ing 18-year-old, 6~foot 5

freshman center who is ‘just
‘learning how to play defen-
sive basketball".

He is one of the ﬁrst men
downcourt when the -Cubs" have

the ball, and one of the last when 3
they don’t. He has_been chasing j
his defensive assignments as if his 1

tennis shoes were sea-diver’s ‘
boots. .
Lovette also gets into foul.

-trouble. “I should cut down my f

fouls now,” he said. f‘And I know
I haven’t been moving fast
enough.”
Best Newcomer
Meanwhile Lovette is probably
the only freshman, except Larry
Szykowny who is now ineligible,
that will bolster the varsity next
winter. ‘ V
The York, Pa. product was a

 forward in high school, but he

.‘ _

 
 

has adopted well his new center
_position, a_ccording to Coach
Carl Peterso‘n."‘He has a tre-
mendous touch,” said Peterson.
“And he keeps the ball high.”

Lovette has been hiding his
touch in the first half of most of
his performances. He only scored
three points in the first half
against Slippery Rock and Robert
.Morris. Against West Virginia he
hit for ﬁve before the intermis-
sion. . _

- ‘Under Pressure

“They concentrate on him in
the ﬁrst half and it’s hard_to feed
him,” Peterson explained.‘ “We
have to shoot from the outside to
take the ‘pressure off him. A ’

 “Pote,ntia_lly,.'he’,,s one of the

-best‘ centers I’ve seen since I’ve
been here,” ' Peterson - added,
‘rrplacing Lovette on a pedestal
with John , Fridley and Paul
Lazor of recent "years. g ..

“He hasf_a soft hook,”- Peterson
noted. It-‘was this maneuver that
pocketed‘. "Lovette; 23 points in ~.the
second half against Robert Morris.

V Lovette is a biology major here
and he likes to watch things grow
—— ,r_na_inly. himself. "So, _he 3 can get
that hook shot a little higher.

Dr. Rankin went on to explain

: the

hthat the SG proposal would have

allowed alcoholic beverages on

campus regardless of the age of

the students. “The University did
not intend this to be so.”
Remarking on the fact that the
policy states a student must be
over 21 years of age and must be
a graduate student, Dr. Rankin

said, “An undergraduate can be

25 years old, but that’s too bad,
he can’t order alcoholic bever-

es in physics are offered next tri-

mester in place of the 18 offered
this trimester.

Nothing Offered

Jill Knorr, liberal arts senior,‘

stated, “I am trying to ﬁnd some-
thing which I can take. Nothing I
want is being offered.” Miss Knorr
wanted to take English drama
during the Spring trimester. En-

‘glish drama, however, is not being

offered during the Spring trimes-
ter. V

“I ﬁnd everything that I want
is offered at 9:00,” Miss Knorr
added. __

During the Winter trimester,
29 English courses were offered.
For the spring trimester, 16 "En-
glish courses are offered.

Albert B. Martin, dean of lib-
eral arts, stated that he is aware
of the complications some of the
students have. Martin explained
most of the scheduling difficulties
are due to students changing their
majors late, or improper schedul-
ing before they reach their last
few trimesters.

Financial Burden

He explained that a financial
burden and a lack of .manpower
are the reasons that a more com-
prehensive schedule of classes
cannot be had during the Spring
trimester.

Liberal arts studgnts who are
having difficulty in arranging
their schedules are urged by Mar-
tin to contact him. He added that
he would do all that he could to
alleviate their problems.
