Administration Rescinds Dorm Restrictions

1- ..Lr

BY SHARON SEXTON
EDITOR

The controversial 1 a.m. restric-
tion on admission of non-residents
to the dormitories will be replaced
by a student endorsed escort sys-
tem beginning Monday September
24.

Vice-Chancellor Alfred Moye
revealed yesterday that his office,
in conjunction with the Office of
Residence Life, decided to rescind
the 1 a.m. policy in accordance with
student concern.

“We felt the students’ proposal
was a reasonable plan which does
not distract from our future
security plans. If the students
think it’s the most workable plan
for them, then that’s the one we
should go with. The effectiveness
of the plan will only become a

problem if the students fail to

cooperate in executing the details
of the system, the signing in, etc.”
The new system adheres in large

A part to the plan outlined by Student

Government President Rege
Kaufman at last week’s Student

Affairs Advisory Committee
(SSAC) meeting.

As explained by Assistant
Vice-Chancellor of Student Activi-
ties William Markus, the new plan
will involve Towers A, B, and C and
MCNR. The security system in
effect in the Quad dorms will not
change.

The new security plan will be in
effect from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. on
Monday through Tursday, from 8
p.m. to 6 a.m. Friday and
Saturday, and from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
on Sunday.

The plan will require that on
each night from 8 p.m. until 1 a.m.
guests report to the desk attendant.

The desk attendant will phone the
proposed host, and upon verbal
confirmation from the host the
guest will be permitted to enter the
dorm unescorted.

After 1 a.m. the host is required
to come down to the lobby, identify
the guest and sign him in. »When
the guest is ready to leave the
host is required to escort him
downstairs and sign him out.

An outside security agency,

Wachkenhut Corp. has been
contracted to provide the desk
attendant personnel.

Markus explained the advantage
of bringing in non-University
personnel. “Working with an
outside agency gives us much more
flexibility. We will have no
problems with unions, with tenure
or with the University payroll.”

Markus said that the University
did not want to use the present
security officers as desk attendants
because of a desire to contrast the
role of the desk attendant with that
of the Campus Police.

“Their’s (the desk attendants’)
is not a control role, they will not be
involved in arresting and detaining
students. Their primary function is
at their desk station. Police
matters will continue to be handled
by the Campus Police.”

The desk attendants will dress in
slacks and blazers with a University
insignia.

Markus feels that an important
facet of the new system is his
agreement with Wackenhut, that
the attendants will periodically

Senate Debates A dd-drop Fee

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

Racism and the $5 add-drop fee
were discussed at the Universtiy
Senate Council meeting Monday.

The add-drop fee was defended
by Vice-chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton as the only
successful way to prevent abuse of
the add-drop system.

Dr. I Audrey Holland

He said some students arbitrarily
abuse the add-drop system by
reserving a seat in many courses in
advance. then dropping unwanted
courses at the beginning of the
term. Dutton feels this has
resulted in locking thousands of
other students out of courses.

Tim; Ging of Student Govern-
ment officially registered that
organizations opposition to the fee
charging “lt attacks the symptom
and not the cause of the problem".
Ging cited the difficulty in
registering for courses without
knowing who teaches it and with
only a brief and poor description of
the course. as a more serious
problem

Dutton agreed with Ging but
stated that until a better system
could be instituted, the fee would
continue. He expressed hope that
a solution could be found in time to
remove the fee for the winter term.
Posvar called for a re—examination
of add-drop policy with student
imput.

The Faculty Senate was con-
demned for avoiding its “obliga-
tion to understant and evaluate the
issue of racism as rationally as
possible" in a position paper
presented by Drs. Audrey Holland
(speech) and Maryann Bishop.

Jensenism, which says blacks
have a genetically determined
intellectual inferiority to whites,
was the focal point of the
discussion.

It was motioned that the Senate
sponsor a public meeting on racism
January 15. 1974. The Council on
Human Concern was given respon-

sibility to present position papers
by December 15, 1973. The motion
passed 25-0 with several absten-
tions.

The Council, headed by acting
president Dr. Robert Newman and
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, also
discussed Student Government
objectives which include the
improvement of student advising
services. the intramural program,
and the Student Union.

Student Government also plead-
ed for improved security adding
“We can't go on protecting
buildings rather than people."

Glenora E. Rossel, Director of
University Libraries, proposed that
faculty lending privleges be limited.
to 25 books at one time. This
would. she feels, cut down on
faculty abuse of the libraries.

She also suggested reporting a
faculty member to his department

rotate desks.

He feels this will insure “more
consistency in operation” by
guarding against familiarity which
could result in indiscriminate
admissions.

When asked why he thought the
new plan was better than the 1
a.m. system, Markus replied, “I’m
not sure that it is. However, in
light of the recent SAAC meeting
and the ambivalence the students
expressed about the system we
hoped to effect, the change was
advisable. In the final analysis, we-
determined we could achieve our
security objectives with the escort

    

policy.” A

Markus‘ continued, “There
seemed to a genuine concern on the
part of the students that the 1 a.m.
system was restrictive and punta-
tive. They viewed themselves as
objects of control. This was never
our intent. The student should be
the beneﬁciary, not the object of
any security system. The change in
policy was a response to this
student concern.”

Reaction of the students who
lobbied for the policy change was
favorable, but guarded.

Tuesday. September 25 in the
Student Union.

The festival will besponsored by
Pitt's Women Studies Program, the
University Women's Center, the
Undergraduate Women's Union,
the Panhellenic Association, and

$250 Blue-Gold Award
Offered Outstanding Student

BY PATTIE MCCAFFERTY

A $250 merit award will again be
offered to a junior or senior who
has made outstanding contri-
butions to the University through
their involvement in activities.

The second annual Blue and
Gold Merit Award will be pre-
sented in conjunction with Home-
coming Week in October. The
Pittsburgh Brewing Company will
donate the necessary funds again
this year. V

The requirements for the award
are that the student must have
full—time status. must be a

Pennsylvania resident, and must
be a junior or senior as of
September, 1973.

The applications will be reviewed
by a panel composed of one faculty
member. two representatives from
the office of Student Affairs. one
alumna, one from the Housing
office. and a representative of the
Student Aid office. Following the
initial review, the finalists will be
selected.

The finalists will be interviewed
by the panel concerning their
involvement and the award will
then be announced by Vice

Chancellor Alfred Moye at the
Leadership Dinner October 24.
The Spirit Committee for Home-
coming is handling the organiza-
tion of the award. Co-chairman
Anita Macaluso said that only 19
applications were received last year
but it is hoped that increased
familiarity with the award will
encourage more students to apply.
Applications may be picked up in
the Student Affairs Reception
Office, 107 Student Union. They
will be available beginning Tues-
day, September 18, and must be
returned by Fi'iday,.October 5.

organizations that are currently
functioning in the University.
Cavinee said it will also inform
them about the services and
supportive people who are sensi-
tive to women’s needs.

Through the festival, Polymorph
also hopes to cultivate interest in
proposed organizations, such as a
day care center and a task force
devoted to the issue of sex
discrimination.

Pat Buddemeyer, an administra-
tive aid for the women’s studies
program, said that although a
female activist group is planning

7 the festival, not all aspects are

geared primarily to feminists. She
added, “We think that many of the
activities will be of interest to men
as well as women.”

Cavinee pointed out that due to
the diversity of women’s groups
involved in Polymorph, the com-
munications system among them is
“Hopefully, the
festival will initiate a better
communication,” she said.

The Polymorph festival will be
the culmination of four months of
preparation. The program will be a
series of films and discussions
presented in the Student Union
Ballroom beginning at 11:15 A.M.
September 25. Seminars and
workshops will also take place
beginning at 11'A.M. Information
tables will be set up by various
women’s groups in the lower
lounge.

views of themselves. They feel
they are in a second class
university, which is not true.”

The fellowships offered vary in
amount and cover many different
areas.

Fellowships differ from scholar-
ships. A scholarship is based on
need, but according to Roberts, “A
fellowship is a reward based on the
work you have done.”

The Rhodes fellowship is for
single males under 24 with athletic
ability. They must study at Oxford
or Cambridge graduate school.

The Marshall is for men and
women who wish to study in Great
Britain. They must be under 26,
but allowances are made for
military duty.

The Fullbright fellowships per-

uate Study  

mits overseas study in any country.

Candidates must be fluent in the
language of the country in which
they wish to study. Those
interested in applying should
contact Pat Mechem at the Center
for International Study.

The Danforth fellowship, often
considered the most “out-
standing" of the fellowships, is
also available.

“Competition is very keen for
top awards and people should get
into the office as soon as possible if
they are interested,” Roberts
emphasized. The Counseling
Center also helps with general
graduate school advising. List of
schools offering accredited pro-
grams are available.

Ed Blakely, of Affirmative

lack of minority faculty. He
reported an 83% decrease in
minority female faculty last year.
At present, minority members
comprise 9% of Pitt's faculty.
Posvar commented “We are far

There are 200 minority applica-
tions now on ﬁle for 28 openings
next fall.

Finally, there was concern over
an article alleging that Pitt's head
football coach Johnny Majors is
receiving an $80,000 salary. The
article, which appeared in College
and University magazine, was
called “grossly irresponsible jour-
nalism” by Posvar. He estimated
Major’s salary as “comparable to a
clean or director".

BY SUSIE EPSTEIN

The Construction of a new
parking garage in Schenley Plaza
(the area between Hillman and
Carnegie Libraries) is presently
being studied.

Joseph Wozniak, executive direc-
tor of the Public Parking Authority
of Pittsburgh, said the proposed
garage would accomodate 600-900
cars. The parking garage would be
underground with a “park type
structure” on the street-level.

A $14,000 engineering study of
the garage, to be performed by
Ramp Consulting Engineers of
New York, has just been approved
by the Parking Authority.

According to Wozniak the study
is an initial step to decide upon the
economic feasibility of such a
garage. “The proposed ﬁnancing
is not yet ﬁrmly established.”

Wozniak expects that if the
garage is built it would be an
“attendant type” for the “conven-
ience of the public.” He feels that
an attendant would eliminate the
problem of lack of correct change.

Monday, September 17, l973—THE PITT NEWS—Page 3

Woznaik added,“The rates for
parking are still flexible.”

Joseph Dutton, Vice Chancellor
of Operations, said the University
“would be happy if the city would
build such a facility, but the
Universtiy, alone, could not afford
to build it.”

In April 1972,, Pitt agreed to
participate in financing the follow-
up of an original study done a few
years ago.

According to Dutton the Univer-
sity “will provide some patronage
to the garage by ﬁnancing a certain
amount of spaces reserved for
University parking."

But Pitt has “no contractual
agreement about amount of dollars
or spaces other than to participate
in the up-dating of the first study.”

There has been some opposition
to the garage from Oakland citizens
who feel that additional parking
will only bring more cars into
already congested Oakland. In
their opinion the funds should be
used to improve public transporta-
tion.

Commuter students have more
questions even if the ﬁnancing and
trafﬁc problems are solved. While
the structure is under construction
the meter-parking that exists now
will be unavailable. “Where will
we park during this period?” is a
common query.

But the question most asked is
still unanswered: Will the
proposed parking cost more than
the existing meter parking?

ment Board member said, “None
of this ever would have happened if
students had been involved in the
planning from the beginning.

“I am glad that the Administra-
tion decided to be responsive to
student opinion. But, I hope more
than anything that they realize we
have a valid voice in policy
determination. I am hoping that
from this we’ll have a ‘new dawn’
where student organizations can
unite, despite constituencies and
move together.”

Life’s more amusing than we
thought. -- Andrew Lang

The reports of their death were
greatly exaggerated.» Thought to
have been sad casualties of the
perpetual street combat between
meter-maids and normal human
beings, the Commuter Bandits
have regrouped and are planning
another, wave of assaults on
Oakland's parking meters.

“We're a group of Pitt students.
approximately ten strong, who visit
the heavy parking areas around
campus, inserting nickels into
expired or nearly expired meters,"
conﬁded Laura Lindbergh, chair-
woman of the vigilante organiza-
tion. “Tickets are then placed on
the windshields informing them of
the service rendered, of the people
who performed it, and offering
them an invitation to join our
ranks."

Lindbergh confessed, however,
that it will require dramatic
participation on the part of
commuters as a united body, if the
operation is to fashion any success.
As people repay the Commuter
Bandits for their daring acts, the
experiment will evolve into a
self-perpetuating movement.

“We haven’t run into any snags
because we have yet to start it on a
full-time basis,” Lindbergh clari-
ﬁed. “We are double-checking to
insure that"no legal hassles will
result from our actions. We've
sent a letter to Mayor Pete Flaherty
and are awaiting his response.”

Lindbergh voiced uncertainty as
to whether or not their services
constitute harboring criminals from
due prosecution. If this proves to

Arty has been driving a Yellow
Cab for three weeks now and
hundreds of fares have heard their
favorite tunes powerfully delivered
from behind the steering wheel.
Arty says that his singing has been
positively received by the cab going

little things that build up to annoy
them during the day,” he says.

“I was born in Pittsburgh. I

be false, then their only opposition
could conceivably be the meter-
maids themselves. The ticket
women's prowess at drafting a
139-2h is unrivalled, and they have
often been accredited with a
huntress’ instinct for violators.

One commuter warily contends
they can “smell" an expiration,
but is generally dismissed as a
victim of acute over-reaction.

Another tangential concern is the
Administration’s posture on such
rebelliousness. Surprisingly en-
ough, though, the Pitt hierarchy
presents a favorable countenance
when questioned about the Com-
muter Bandits.

“The parking meter practices in
Oakland are very restrictive and
discriminatory against the stu-
dents," observed Gary Houston,
executive assistant to the Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs.
“Parking is at a premium on
campus and to have mere
two-hour meters for student and
faculty use is ridiculous.”

Houston vouchsafed his grati-
tude for anyone who would
voluntarily ante up his meter. “I
love the notion of a Commuter
Bandits’ cadre here at Pitt." He
expressed belief that such action
could be the stimulating motivation
City Hall needs to rectify the
current dilemma.

Alden Bowen. co-ordinator of the
University Student Judicial Sys-
tem. furnished a legal perspective
in his evaluation of the proposed
campaign pledged by the campus

desperadoes. “There’s nothing
illegal about someone putting
money in a parking meter." Bowen
stipulated.

Oakland that suits the students’

singer. “Last Spring I stopped
traffic on Forbes Avenue. People
just started to gather."

Getting started. for Arty, meant
about two years encampment in the
back woods of Pennsylvania. He
lived alone in a trailer. He watched
the season, made friends. and
wrote music.

“I remember one time I walked
into this truck stop-restaurant. I
had about forty-ﬁve cents in my
pocket. long hair, and no shoes,
These truckers just kind of sneered
at me, but nobody said anything.

“But just as I picked up my
guitar to leave, this guy says, ‘can
you play that or do you just carry it
around to look good?‘ I started
playing for them. Your Cheatin'
Heart. country stuff, . and they
started throwing dollar bills at me.
It was unbelievable."

Art has spent much of his time
traveling around the country. He
says Geminis like to travel. For a
while he drove a cab in Ocean City,
Md., and made some fame. But,
his real ambition is to cut a record,
own a horse ranch, and write more
music. '

Arty never stops playing music.
It is incredible that he can keep it
up all day too. Every delivery has
an emotional punch that startles
the listener. His own work is
packed with a kind of violent
execution that not only draws
attention but even shocks.

“When somebody gets in my cab
I usually just start singing.
Sometimes they'll even sing
along." Arty sings Blues for blue
people, rock for rock people and
he’ll even croon for the Bing
Crosby set. “Good music is good
music. I don't like classifying
things because people develop a

schedule. It appears to me that
they are deliberately creating a
situation that necessitates the
issuance of a lot of tickets,” Bowen
alleged. “They know that the
meters place the students in a bind,
and you never fail to see
meter-maids ticketing cars ﬁfteen
minutes before,a class ends.”
Bowen advised that consulting
Mayor Flaherty would be unwise,
since to be fore-wamed is to be
fore-armed.

Bowen reserved his praise and
admiration for the Commuter
Bandits. afﬁrming that the faculty
and staff are as equally perturbed
with a 139-2h as commuters profess
to be.

Perhaps most unpredictable of
all is the reaction of Angela
Marasco, chief clerk of Traffic
Court, when informed of the
resurgence of active resistance to
the citation barrage.

“lt's wonderful,” Marasco re-
joined, rather enthused about the
impending guerilla activity. “As
far as I'm concerned, if they want
to put money in the meters. it's ﬁne
with me." She even advanced the
great notion that Pitt “should start
constructing parking lots so that
students can avoid the meters."
Marasco sympathized with the
futility inherent in attempting to
elude the little red sign that
obsequiously smiles. “Violation."

So, it beﬁts the rest of‘ us.to
envision the ensuing chaos that
could well become a feature of
Oakland highlife. The spectacle of
a frustrated meter-maid and a
masked. unshaven Commuter
Bandit dashing frenetically down
Bigelow Boulevard. impaling wind-
shields with tickets of varying
hues, portrays a comedy of horrors.

dislike for all music in a class they
don't like. Me & Bobby McGee is a
country song, but a lot of the
people who like the song would
probably say that they don’t like
country music." ‘

“Why did I start? To break the
formality of cab driver and
passenger. Of course, being a
cab-driver gives me extra time to
write. That’s important.”

Arty tried to get some of his
music published before. But it
didn't work out. He found New
York cold and the New Yorkers

plastic. As he put it, “They invite
you in the door but they don't want
you to wipe your feet on the rug."
So, Arty is going to Nashville.

“I'm trying to get some money
together. ljust bought this guitar.
It's a Martin D-28. My ‘landlady
helped me buy it. It's tough. but I
think if I could get a record
released in Pittsburgh it would go
over big."

“But. let me play you something
else--just to show you that I can do
some people you like." Arty

nevers stops singing.

“First, let me play you a song, then we’ll talk.”

BAS Bids For Expanded
The Commuter Bandits Return Commjffee Membershgp

BY DAVID CAPPELLI

The Black Action Society (BAS)
held its ﬁrst meeting of the term
September 17, to encourage active
membership in its various commit-
tes.

William Kilson, chairman of BAS
said the basic goal of the
organization is responsiveness to
students’ problems, and especially
those of the University’s black
community. He cited the 1:00 AM
curfew and Pitt’s Hill District
expansion as two areas where BAS
will become involved.

As an orientation to freshmen and
new members, representatives
from each committee discussed
their plans for the coming year and
urged black participation.

William Lowman, chairman of the
political action committee of BAS,
said that over the years BAS “has
grown away from black students
and gotten timid.”

As a solution to the problems of
the black students, Lowman added,
“We must try to motivate people,
especially the administration, to
the needs of the black students,”
and suggested involvement of
black students as a way to achieve
this goal. ‘

Social Committee chairwoman
Donna Barnes emphasized the
need for workers to help organize
events for Black Week slated for
November 11-16. This year’s Black
Week will feature a talent
competition. fashion show. concert,
and a major production by Black

Action. Theatre.

Dealing with the campus and
black community are the duties of
Michael Hayes, chairman of the
public relations committee. He
plans a series of tapes for Black
Week including Flack and Donny
Hathaway-In Concert" and “The
Death of Fred Hampton."

BAS members are involved in
Basics, an organization for black
students within the Commonwealth
to deal with problems facing black
students on a larger scale. Student
aid and curriculum changes are two
of the areas with which Basics is
concerned.

Kilson emphasized that member-
ship in BAS is needed. “BAS is a
clique," he said, “people doing the
same thing, at the same place, at
the same time, however, the clique
can expand."

‘Siege’ Examines Slate's Power

BY JESS BRALLIER

State of Siege reaches and
effects the viewer for, it plays with
his hatreds, his feelings, and his
political attitudes. Why? Because
each of us, admitting it or not, are a
unique part of the United States’
international inﬂuences, powers,
and weaknesses. These aspects
are the subject matter of State of
Siege.

The movie’s plot-is factual, a
very slightly disguised reinactment
of the kidnapping and murder of
A.l.D. official Daniel Mitrione, in
Uruguay in 1970/ by Tupamaro
guerrillas. Through the investiga-
tive efforts of director Costa-
Gavras. and screen-writer Franco
Solians. the facts have been found.
Because of the realism and
viewpoint of this movie) it was
eliminated at the premiere attrac-
tion at the Kennedy Center's
opening of its American Film
Institution theater.

Costa-Gavras with Z and The
Confession to his credit, and
Franco Solinas best known for The
Battle of Algiers. work together as
a smooth and complimentary team.

The movie starts as a well written
novel might, relaying enough
information to grab the audience's
attention and at the same time
laying theggroundwork for what
follows. Steadily and at equal
rates. the audience meets the
necessary participants on both
sides of the major conflict, the
terrorists and the South American
government_. I was surprised that
we were first given scenes of the
funeral of the movie's A.I.D.
director, Philip Santore. After all
that ‘suspense, can one expect that
we know the eventual outcome of
the kidnapping. Faced with such a
question. Solinas replys, “..we
hadn't wanted to make a suspense
film. We tried to put our question
to the public, not on the classical
level--is he going to die?--but

rather, is he or isn't he responsi-
ble.

Throughout the film, there is
continuing conflict between the
country’s liberal media and the
conservative government. The
conflict is well used, too. for not
only is the conflict interesting, but
through this method much of the
needed information is revealed.
Along the same line, is an
interrogation of the kidnapped
Santore by a leading guerrilla
being complimented by the use of
flashbacks, not only informs the
audience of the background of the
situation, but also it begins to
formulate opinion toward Santore
and the guerrilla movement.

Another continuing conflict is
that between the liberal and
conservative members of the
country's Congress. The validity
and hopelessness of the situation
comes alive as the two forces
argue. always failing to compro-
mise.

Also, with careful control, humor
and music are used, adding tone
and reality.

The movie expresses a very
anti-American feeling, obviously
valid and meant to remain in the
viewer's memory. Sadly, and my
only disappointment in the produc-
tion of an other wise superb film, is
the unnecessary and favorable
slanting toward the guerrillas. The
cruel torture and murders of
guerrillas by the police is vividly

ﬁlmed. The police are emotionless,
scared, and ugly; the guerrillas are
all handsome and likable. I find
such characterizations hard to
believe. A near complete
acceptance of terrorist kidnapping
is expressed by the film makers.
Advocates of this might also like to
make a national holiday of the
murder of the Israeli athletes 'at
Munich. While we're being sick.
we could also make heros of every
terrorist who blows up a plane and
its innocent victims. But what is so
senseless about this slanted effect,
is that even without it. I am sure
that the seemingly valid Anti-
American viewpoint would have
been conceived by the viewer.

All in all, though, State of Siege,
showing in Shadyside, is a movie
that will affect you as a citizen, and
most likely that effect will hurt, but
in the long run, it will open and
educate the viewer’s political
attitudes.

Baylor Limping Into Pitt Tilt

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

Two rebuilding football teams
will clash this Saturday at Pitt
stadium when the Panthers play
host to the Baylor Bears. From the
coach on down, the two schools
have had many similar experiences
in their battle to become winning
football teams.

Baylor hired a new, young coach
season, 39-year old Grant
Teaff. ‘ The Bears opened last
season against Georgia, with the
Bulldogs heavy favorites, and
nearly pulled off an upset, losing
24-14.

This season. Baylor was demo-
lished by Oklahoma, 42-14. Asked
if he thought Oklahoma was an
unrealistic opener, as Majors said
Georgia was. Teaff replied, “Un-
realistic? They were unreal. For
all practical purposes. the game

\ was over at halftime."

Teaff spoke from Waco, Texas
via telephone hookup at the weekly
Pitt football luncheon. Teaff
admitted that Baylor had its
problems as it prepared for
Saturday’s game.

"We had four starters injured in
the Oklahoma game, and our depth
wasn't that good to begin with." he
admitted. Lost for Saturday’s
game are: Offensive tackle Allan
Pittman. tight end David Steven,
wide receiver Alcy Jackson. backup
noseguard Vic Sobotie, and line-
backer Tim Black. who also does
the placekicking and kicking off for
the Bears.

Oklahoma is ineligible for bowl
games this year because of
recruiting violations. “If the
Republican party comes out of their
investigation the way Oklahoma
did," cracked Baylor Sports In-
formation Director Don Oliver,
“they’ll be in the White House
forever."

“Oklahoma is the finest team I
have seen in 30 years of college

football,” said Oliver. So although -

the Bears will be facing a less

formidable opponent this week,

they will still have their work cut
out for them. The Panthers did not
suffer any injuries that will keep
players out of the Baylor game.

Aksed if he thought the game
would be high scoring, Teaff said,
“I doubt if we can score too many
points against Pitt. ljust hope we
can keep the Pitt scoring low. I've
been saying all summer that Pitt is
the toughest team we’ll play all
season. next to Oklahoma.”

‘The Sooiiers' middleguard,
Lucius Selmon. wrecked havoc on
the Baylor offense last Saturday,
and this week, the one that got
away will be out to do the same

“Barley” A

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Gary Burley. a junior college
transfer who has quickly captured
the imaginations of the famished
Pitt football fan, got his first taste
of major college football last
weekend in Athens, Georgia.

And. while it wasn't the way he
had originally planned it as a
Columbus, Ohio schoolboy, there
are absolutely no regrets now.

“Yeah, I got my first taste--I like
the taste.” Burley said after
Monday night's practice at Pitt
Stadium.

Against the Georgia Bulldogs,
Burley teased his taste buds by
making six individual tackles from
his middle guard slot. He spent a
great deal of the afternoon
shadowing highly touted Bulldog
QB Andy Johnson and playing an

ﬂu W’

  

intregal part in the newfound
steadiness of the Panther defense,
which spearheaded the 7-7 tie.

Considering what Burley has
done in junior college, he has to be
the most notorious athletes ever to
come to Pitt. At Wharton Junior
College (Houston), Burley earned
All-American honors twice at
defensive end; was voted the most
valuable player in last year’s JC
circuit; and, was honored by
opposing coaches as the best JC
lineman to come out of Texas in the
last ten years.

But, were it not for an injury his
senior year in high school, it is
doubtful Burley would have
achieved those high marks at
Wharton and wouldn’t be at Pitt
today.

Columbus, Ohio is Woddy Hayes

thing. Gary Burley, a junior
college transfer student, is the
anchor of the Pitt defense, and he
had narrowed his choices to Pitt or
Baylor, before deciding to become
a Panther.

“Pitt has a fine football team,”
said Teaff after having seen the
films of the Georgia game.
“Watching those films, I felt with
Pitt. We didn’t play as well against
Georgia as Pitt did. I’m proud for
them, but they also scare me.”

Pitt head coach Johnny Majors
spoke at the luncheon, and brought
along with him offensive tackle
Dave Wannstedt and defensive end
Jim Buckmon.

“I was thankful to have come out
of the Georgia game in good
physical condition, and I'm sure
glad we didn't lose after all the
work the players did. We played
four quarters of football, and sure
didn't deserve to lose.”

Majors related that he was more
relaxed for the Georgia game than
for any game he’s ever coached.
“We had nothing to lose and
everything to gain,” he pointed
out.

Baylor will be bringing about
eight freshmen on the trip. Majors
used eleven young people against
Georgia. “You can't get down on
your young people," said Majors.
“Our punting wasn't as good as I
would have liked, but remember
that was a freshman in his first
collegiate game. Larry Swider will

wanted to go to Ohio State. He had
visions of “local boy makes good.”

“But, I got hurt my senior year
and missed five games. They lost
interest,” Burley remembered. “I
guess they were afraid to take the
risk on me.

“I was disappointed, but my
coach told me to go to a junior
college and take it from there."

Burley is a 6-3, 250 behemoth
who had to do a lot of soul
searching after his Wharton career

' came to a close last Spring and by

the time he finished digesting his
80 major college offers, he found
out he wasn't that interested in
Ohio State any more.

“They (the Buckeyes) asked for
some films, but they took their time
and didn’t contact me until it was
too late.”

Instead Burley narrowed the list

to Oklahoma, Nebraska, Notre
Dame, Baylor, and Pitt. Eventually
he chose Pitt over Baylor because:
1) “Pitt is close to home and my
father can drive to watch me play."
2) “I like the coaches. Coach (Jim)
Dyar became both friend and
coach." 3) “Pitt plays a tough
schedule and Pittsburgh is in. a
good location for pro ball." 4)
“Pitt didn't break any rules trying
to recruit me."

Grant Teaf. whose Baylor Bears
invade Pitt Stadium this Saturday
afternoon, knows his hands will be
full with Burley--that is if Gary can
shake off the ill effects of a
souvenir sprained ankle from the
Georgia game.

“He's an excellent ballplayer,”
Teaf said of Burley, at the weekly
press luncheon on Tuesday.
“Burley is just as good as
Oklahoma’s Lucius Selmon. We
just got outrecruited. Majors
whipped us reall good on him.”

Burley runs the 40 in 4.6, which
is excellent for a man his size. He
is also as quick as the proverbial
cat.

“But, I think my greatest assest
is technique. Burley ‘added.

BILL DANIELS will once again get the starting call from coach”

Future

Still In Limbo

BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
Time is running for the Pitt

Hockey Club and ‘right now the
skaters are still without financial
support from the University. At
the last meeting with members of
the Allocations Committee the
Hockey Club’s request for funds
was tabled once again but should
be acted upon some time later this
week._

The future does appear to be
somewhat brighter for the skaters
and University support has become
more of a probability than
possibility. The question remains,
however, as to which department of
the University will come up with
the ‘money. ' ‘

According to William Lenaghen,
Assistant Director of Student
Activities, the Student Government
Board is investigating the pos-
sibility of handing over the skater’s
bills to the Athletic Department.
Since Casimir Mislinski has been
out of town on business all week, a
formal decision has not been
reached.

“The Hockey Club is going to be
hard pressed as far as time and
money is concerned,” Lenaghen
commented. “But things do look
fairly favorable.”

The main concern of the Club as

"to how soon they will be funded

deals primarily with the booking of
ice time. The longer the skaters
wait to book a rink to practice. the
smaller the selection of favorable
times available will become. One
thing that the Club would like to

Burley is a two month newlywed
and admitted that Tina “Crazy
Kitten” Burley congratulated him
on the Georgia game.

“She doesn’t know everything
about football," he said of his wife,
“but ‘Kitten' knows when I've
done well.

“I think I played better in the
second half down there." he said.
“I was tired in the first half. I don't
know where it came from, but I got
a second wind in the second half.

“You know, I was kind of weary
about coming to Pitt," Burley
finalized. “I didn't know if we
would be able to win. Now, I'm
glad I came."

avoid is another early morning,
weekday practice.

Last year the skaters practiced
exclusively at the Alpine Ice
Chalet. One of the stipulations in
their contract was that they take
two practice sessions: one “prime
time" session on a weeknight, and
one early morning weekday

' session. The team wound up with a
6:00 a.m. practice once a week and
the time posed problems. .

Since each member of the Club
had to provide his own transporta-
tion, the attendance at those early
practices was low because the
Alpine is located in Swissvale. This
year that problem could be avoided
if the team switches to the Sewickly
Arena. Even though the traveling
distance would be greater, the Club
would be offered a better selection
of times to choose from and could
possibly eliminate the early morn-
ing practice all together.

At the general meeting held last
night, the Club members discussed
the option of playing without the
use of the middle red line. Pitt
would like to adopt this rule for
league play to make the game move
faster from a spectators point of
view. The NCAA plays without the
red line and Pitt has played under
such a rule at State College, where
the skaters beat Penn State last
year.

Also discussed were the formal
election of officers to take place at
the next general Club meeting.
The date and place should be
announced later this week.

In Season

Opener Sat.

With little experience and less
depth, Pitt’s cross country squad
faces a seven meet schedule this
year, beginning with the California
State Invitational this Saturday.

“We've got a young team,”
notes Coach Jim Banner, “and
we’ve very shallow depthwise. The
abscense of injuries will be the key
to our season.”

Bob Steele, who finished 17th in
last year's IC4A’s meet, is Pitt’s
most‘ experienced returnee. And
junior Mickey Collins, who has
been plagued with injuries, ap-
pears to be ready now.

Behind those two are runners
with little experience. Bob 0’NeiI,
Nick Martin, Rick Markley and
Terry Wile will round out Banner’s
other top six spots. Wile was the
WPIAL Class B cross country
champion last year.

“What little experience we
received last year will help,” says
Banner, “and these athletes are
working very hard. They each
averaged about 70-80 miles of
running each week since July 1.
They form a good group that can
continue the success that cross
country has enjoyed at Pitt.”

become a fine punter. You just
have to show him confidence."

Commenting on his super-frosh
running back, Tony Dorsett,
Majors said. “He was as poised as
any freshman I've ever seen. He
not only ran well, but his blocking
was excellent as_well.”

Majors also stated that ‘he was
quite pleased with the smoothness
with which his coaching staff
operated. Asked if Majors gave the
team a Knute Rockney type speech
at halftime, Buckmon replied, “No
he didn’t make any big speech, he
was just jumping around like he
usually does.”

Wannstedt, who went from 253
lbs. to 228 lbs. since last season,
said that he didn’t feel stronger,
but quicker. “At the beginning of
the fourth quarter, when everyone

' started screaming and raising four
fingers, I got my second wind, and
wasn’t really tired from then on.”

“I don't believe in losing weight
just for the sake of losing weight,”
said Majors. “We're “looking to
find the player’s weight at which he
is quickest. Gary Burley plays at
248 pounds. We need some real
big players, but generally, we like
to work for speed.”

Majors told the press that Bob
Medwid will not be ready for
Saturday’s game, and that the
backup quarterback situation is not
set yet. Majors emphasized that
Billy Daniels is the number one
quarterback, and implied that
whenever Medwid returns, there
will be a battle between the two for
the top slot. He added that Daniels
calls about 30% of the plays, with
the coaching staff calling the rest.
Daniels call audibles from the line
at any time, Majors added.

One of the areas that Majors said
he would be concentrating on
during this week's practices will be
kick returns. “Our kick coverage
was good, but our returns need
work," he said. Freshman Robert
Haygood is the Panther punt
returner, and against Georgia, he
just didn’t believe in fair catches.
“He’ll make some exciting runs,”
promised Majors.

PANTHER TRACKS -- Baylor
will arrive Friday afternoon, and
work out at the Stadium...Their
home ﬁeld had Astroturf installed
last season...A crowd of more than
35,000 is expected for the game,
which would surpass last year's
high of 29,000 for the West Virginia
game...Majors said he will dress
about 65 players for the game.

VD Out
To Cop
Yogis?  

VD DiNardo jumped out to an
early lead in the 1973 Pitt Yogi
contest by predicting 12 of 15
games correctly.

“There's no stopping me now,”
VD chuckled, “once I get started I
just keep on growin’ and growin’
and growin’ .... ..”

One reason for the mediocre
showings by most of the yogis is
the fact that the Pitt-Georgia
contest ended in a tie, hence
nobody was correct. This week
there should be a few more Pitt
Victory predictions.
