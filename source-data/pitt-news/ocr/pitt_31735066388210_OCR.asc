Smoking complaints should go to department heads

By Jenna Ferrara
Copy Editor

People who smoke in iiniversity
buildings won't be arrested by the campus
police, but they might face other
disciplinary action, according to the
assistant director of public safety.

‘The enforcement lof the smoking banl
is not through law enforcement; it is
enforced by people making complaints to
the department‘ where the offenses occur,
said Walt Waters.

llecaiise the tiniversity sriioking han
exceetls the limitations of city and state
prohilmions upon smoking, “officers can’t
make arrests for violations ofthe uiiiversity
policy," said \lI'.’aters 'lhe administration is
responsible for enforcing the ban, he said

‘If the complaint originates in the law
school, for example, then the complaint
goes to administrators in the law school,
who would handle it from there," said
Waters.

Penalties for smoking in university
buildings could include ‘a counseling

sexsioii, then possibly a letter ( ifreprimand
If it came to that. you could give the
person time off," he said

The smoking policy is enforced mainly
by the “honor system,” said Waters

‘it's one of those types of things where
you mu st rely more upon compliance than
law enforcement," said Waters. 'lfwe can
get people complying voluntarily, they
won't have to involve the police.‘

The Department of Public Safety was
not consulted before the smoking ban
became university policy on Feb. 1. he

said

People with i orriplaints ;llV)lll smoking

police to take ( are of the prohlcrrn “ms at
last resort. ("all lpublic safety], and we
could take lthe complaint] to the head or

Waters

The campus police are not patrolling
university buildings to look for people
smoking, said Waters, ‘lfwhile performing

Treatment for Alzbeimeris studied

 

By Monica Novak
Suﬁ Writer

Pitt researchers are conducting
a study investigating the use of
the dmg Buspar to treat patients
who suffer from adverse
behavioral problems caused by
dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease.

According to Dr. Mark Levy, a
geriatric medicine fellow at the
University of Pittsburgh, these
symptoms include anger,
agitation and aggression and
make care difficult.

‘It is this type of behavior that
precipitates nursing homes," said
levy.

Levy said that the goal of the
study is to minimize these
behaviors. “There is no niedicinc
that will restore memory or
lrernovt-l prohlerns that go all log

with alt-rm-riti;t,” said l.L‘\ v “\\.i‘

are treating a condition that is not
effectively treatable.‘

In the fourth month of research,
it is still too early to make any
valid conclusions about the
success of Buspar, according to
less}. levy said that the drug has
been approved for use by the
Food and Drug Administration to
treat anxiety.

Levy said. “lOf thel 10,000
people tested, it has been clearly
proven that the side effects of
Buspar are less severe and less
frequent [than other neuroleptic
drugsl." Nausea, drowsiness,
nervousness and increased
agitation are among some of the
common side effects, he said.

buspirone lthe generic name for
Busparl have shown that the drug

The Yiebnquisition ’. ..
A court which has, in the past, prided itself upon strict
laws protecting citizens’ rights has taken a major step

. backward.

The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that suspects’
coerced confessions can be used as evidence in a court
of law. The confession itself, however, cannot be used
alone; evidence from other sources must be sufficient to
convict the suspect. These confessions would merely be
an assurance of victory for prosecuting attorneys.

Previously, suspects who claimed that police physically
abused them to produce a confession usually had the
charges against them dismissed.

This ruling by the high court came only a week after a
decision which said that evidence found in a “good
intention" search could be used even if the officer had no
warrant.

These two decisions will make usable evidence easier
to come by, expanding police powers to supersede
citizens’ constitutional guarantees.

The court is supposed to uphold the Constitution, and
the court's violation of one of the basic tenets of freedom,
the right of due process, is frightening. The Fifth
Amendment clearly states that no person will have to say
anything which could lead to self-incrirnination. This
decision will encourage police to get information from
suspects by any means possible.

This most recent ruling, however, becomes even more
disturbing in light of the recent beating of Rodney King
by four Los Angeles police officers.

If police can use this type of force in public, force used
behind closed doors could become extensive. The timing
of the high court's decision is not only ironic but
frightening as well. I

Innocent people could be the hardest hit by this ruling.
The numbers of innocent people confessing to crimes
they did not commit may skyrocket as a result of law-
enforcement officers trying to get higher Conviction
percentages.

If a person is charged with a crime such as armed
robbery and does not confess to it, the prosecution must
force the jury to reach a guilty verdict beyond the shadow
of a doubt. This ruling makes the job of convincing a jury
much easier.

The court system is set up to allow a suspect a fair trial.
This decision, however, gives attorneys an added
advantage at the expense of the suspect’s rights. The jury,
without hearing any evidence at all, will know that the
suspect confessed under pressure.

Proof could eventually take a back seat to forced arguments have some basis in 2.000 unes-coded miles on the RamseyClarksawonthesidwo«f

A116 the

At Monday night's Students for Life meeting,
Michael Andreola, executive director of the
southwestern region of Pennsylvanians for Human
Life, denounced euthanasia as ‘the deliberate
taking of human lives" and compared this to Nazi
Germany's systematic killing of citizens which the
government considered to be leading useless or
unproductive lives. Perhaps Andreola believes we
should not let people die with dignity, or that we
should try to play "God" by keeping people alive
long after their time has come.

For two summers, I worked in a nursing home as
a nurse's aide. My duties involved feeding patients,
lifting them out of bed, helping them on to the
toilet, etc. In that time, I came into contact with
many such patients that Andreola was concerned
about. Many patients at the home are on tube-

a person who cannot fully digest it like a healthy
person can. Tubes go through the nose, sometimes
even through an incision in the stomach.

A majority of these patients were not coherent,
and some were comatose, occasionally crying out
once in while like an infant. let me describe one
such patient who was ‘mercifully’ being kept alive
by such a machine.

This woman’s legs and arms were contracted
(bent) to the point that straightening them would
have broken her joints. Having her arms in this
position made it very hard to clean her properly;
thus, she always had an odor around her. She had
cancerous tumors, which also added a smell of
rotting ﬂesh. She had no control over her bowel
movements or bladder, but because her legs had
contracted so much, a diaper could not be put on
her, so she needed to be checked periodically so

that she would not have to lie in her body waste.

when I met her, she had a open, green bed sore
on her buttocks. She could not lie on that part of
her body. The nurse told me she could see a bone
through the sore; I chose not to look. She was fed

I think we try to play ‘God’ when our doctors I, _ ,..
look for ways to keep people alive beyond their C , I 

time. We have to recognize the time when we have
done enough forsomeone, and we should let them
die instead of prolonging the agony. Technically,

nourishing them constitutes life. However, if that is  I 
all we are doing —- letting them exist — we owe . e 

it to them to let them go.
Some people may say, ‘But you don't know if

they are suffering, so you can't let them die.’ I I

Pitt football program too thin to experience 1991 success

another beginning. its time to stan talking about football

Alex Van Pelt will attempt to overcome last season's ‘sophomore jinx.‘

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

The Academy Awards were handed out
on Monday night, and despite a strong
write—in vote, the 1990 Pitt football team's
highlight film was not chosen as Most
Disappointing Screenplay.

However, there is one tape of outtakes
from last season, starring Alex Van Pelt,
that could have won in another dubious
category: \X’orst Performance by a
Quarterback in a leading Role.

“We’ve got a reel of film with all my
interceptions and mistakes on it," said Van
Pelt. “l’ve watched that thing 100 times;
basically, it's a film of my humiliations."

Van Pelt doesn't enjoy watching his
mistakes, but he thinks the film can help
him in 1991. The Panthers began spring
practice for the upcoming season last
Friday.

“It's been very educational. I'm learning
a lot from it," said Van Pelt, who completed
57.3 percent of his passes and threw for
2,427 yards and M TT)s last year as a
sophomore.

But this film docsn’t have any highlights
on it, only interceptions —— 17 of them.

After a record—scttjng freshman campaign

where he guided the Panthers to an 8~3—
1 record and ajohn Hancock Bowl victory
in 108‘), Van Pelt and the Panthers fell to
571 last year, with Van Pelt often
.shouldering the role of the fall guy.

“The quarterback affects more people
than any other position; therefore, he

must take more responsibility for going 3-
7-] than anyone else," said Pitt Coach Paul
llackett. ‘'1 le lost Reggie Williams, he lost
llenry Tuten; he lost Curvin Richards for
much of the year. So many things were
new that it was hard for him to keep up a
consistent level of play."

“I think once Curvin went down last
year with an injury, I started doing too
much to try to pick up the slack," said Van
Pelt. “l was anxious and started forcing
the ball in there. We started to get out of
our offense, and when you start to free
lance, that’s when you get in trouble. This
year I'm going to stay more in the offense
and try to keep to nine or 10 interceptions.”

Richards, Pitt's leading msher for three
straight years, started only six games last
year because of an ankle injury, dumping
all the offensive pressure onto Van Pelt.

‘When Curvin went down, we seemed
to get into a lot of third-and-seven, third-
andeightsituations, and as a quarterback,
you see yourself trying to make the big
play,” said Van Pelt.

“He'd try to do it himself instead of
letting the offense work for him,” said
llackett. “l le has a natural tendency to do
that. He wants to be successful; he wants
to do well.”

This season Van Pelt says he won't be so
quick to do it all himself, even though he
won't have Richards in the backfield at all
any more since Richards declared hirnst-lf
eligible for the .\'l-‘I. draft next month.

Pens win at The Spectrum,

By Brian Berger
Sla_ﬂ' Writer

The Pittsburgh Penguins moved
one giant step forward in their
ﬁrst quest for the Patrick Division
regular-season crown by
overwhelming the sinking
Philadelphia Flyers 3-1 in front of
17,000-plus worried Flyer
faithfuls.

The Pens’ victory. coupled with
the New York Rangers‘ }3 tie
with I\’ew}ersey, put the Penguin
lead at two points over the
Rangers and placed the Pens‘

magic number for clinching the
Patrick title at two as well.

Enough of the formalities and
onto the ice. The Flyers came out
determined in the opening frame
by firing 20 shots on Penguin
goaltender Tom Barrasso. He
turned away all but one. a Terry
Carkner rebound ofa Keith Acton
shot.

;\1arioLemieux played the game
for all it was worth by netting a
brilliant hat trick that included a
shorthanded breakaway goal
which left Flyer netrninder Pete
Peeters wishing he were back in

\\".t.shington l le also had a power-
play partial breakaway goal that
had Peeters wanting to be back
in Boston and another power-
play goal that had Peeters
sprawled out on the ice like a
seal.

Im sorry (.7) to all the Flyer fans
because I certainly can
sympathize with the situation the
Flyers are in at the moment; the
Pens have done nothing but hide
whenever March rolls around.
However, the possibility of
Philadelphia not making the after-
hours ball is a pleasant thought

The Penguin tradition, as
opposed to the Flycrs', is a folk
tale about to be born. This is the
best Penguin team of all time -
really not as dramatic a thought
as it may appear to be. But what
is remarkable about this club is
that it is playing its best hockey
when it counts most and it looks
like one of the top teams in the
NHL.

In comparison to any team in
Penguins‘ past, this is the first
club that is deep with defensernen
and forwards who are willing to
win individual battles in front of

on course for division title

the net and along the boards. The
addition ofScott Young, the health
of Bryan Trottier (175 career
playoff games) and Troy Loney
(both who were injured much of
the year), the emergence of
Jaromirjagr as an offensive threat
and tremendous work along the
boards gave the Pens depth that
didn‘t seem possible even in
January.

The play of the defense has
also propelled the Pens. L'lf

Recruiting hometown coaches to lure players unethical

While most of the college
basketball world was focused on
the regional finals last weekend.
an announcement came from Ann
Arbor, Mich._ that the Lhiversity
of Michigan had signed high-
school players Chris Webber and
Jalen Rose.

Webber, depending on who
you talk to, is the top player in
the country, and many thought
he would be going to Michigan
State last fall But 1.’. of Michigan
Coach Steve Fisher came on
strong and convinced \X'ebber to
play for the \X'olverines.

It probably didn't hurt Fisher
that Rose, one of \\"ebber‘5'
friends, alsochose Michigan Rose

Webber, so the story goes,
always wanted to pla_v for Watson,
but his mother directed him to

will probably smell a rat, as it
were. But nothing will be done.
.\'0t that Michigan should be
singled out for this behavior; there
are many schools who hire prep
coaches in an attempt to lure the
players to follow their leaders.
LSL' did this two years ago, when
Coach Dale Brown announced
the signing of ‘-foot Stanley
Roberts and the hiring of his
coach within days of each other.
Roberts is now playing in Spain,
haying ﬂunked out of school.
'lhe process doesn't work all
the time, however. Here at Pitt,
assistant basketball coach john
Sarandrea was hired two years
ago after several great years
coaching Tolentine High School
in New York Pitt was hoping that
open the

Tolentine has had several ﬁne
players, including Malik Sealy of
St. John's and Brian Reese of
.\'orth Carolina. Notice that neither
decided to attend Pitt, which
might have been better for them,
now that Sarandreas name has
been connected with the coaching
vacanqr at Iona College.

As usual, college basketball has
no solution for this problem.
Maybe it works out well for some
players, but every time a college
hires a coach and then signs his
players, it points out the
importance of athletics at those
schools. You never hear about a
school hiring a math teacher in
order to attract that schools top
students. That would be a real
.sl’t()Ck.

wait until at least fall camp to

throw to his top receivers.
Kevin Williams and Ronald
Redmon are out with injuries for
the time being, making the
backfield so thin that it's almost

transparent.
o\Vith punter Brian Greenfield
gone, the Panthers find

themselves in need of a fourth-
down booter. (}reenfield's shoes
will be hard to fill. He ﬁnished
second in the nation with a 45.6-
yards-per-kick average and was
named first-team All—America and
All-East, as well as earning ECAC
All-Star honors.

Special teams provided some
of the high points in a dismal
19% season, and not only is
Greenfield gone, but the special-

teams mastermind, Coach Scott
O'Brien, has left Pitt for a position
with the Cleveland Browns.
Former tight—ends coach Chuck
Jones will serve as the new
special-teams coach.

Speaking of new coaches,
Ilackett said after the Penn State
defat last season, ‘I've watched
changes affect this team since
I've been here, and that's
wounded our ability to be
successful in the first year. But as
I look to the second and third
years, I would like to make as
few changes as possible and keep
everything intact. We don't have
many people on our football team
that have been coached by the
same man more than two years.‘

Well, several changes have
taken place in the coaching ranks
in addition to the special-teams
shuffle. Many Galbraith, who

served the past two years as
offensive coordinator and
offensii-e~Iine coach at Wake
Forest, will assume the
responsibilities of coaching Pitt's
tight ends. Jon Gruden, 27, will
be the new wide receivers’ coach,
as former \);1t coach Skip Peete
moves to anchor the ninning
backs because of the spot left
vacant by 'I'ommie Liggins. Tim
\\'ilson, who worked with L'.\'L\'
from 1982-85 and the Chicago
\\ hite Sox from l‘X3'.7-89, will be
the new strength and conditioning
co;ttlt, replacing Guy Bennardo.

\\ hat Ilackett wanted to avoid
has happened. Ideally, he wanted
no coaching changes. What he
got was two new skippers in
Galbraith and Wilson and two
position coaches who shifted
positions.

It remains to be seen how

minor or major the changes will
prove to be, but for a stability-
rninded head coach who is still
trying to establish and institute a
concrete system, any change
requires the need to acclimate
newcomers to an existing system.
Hackett wanted to avoid this as
much as possible, but he couldn't

Despite all the uncertainty, Paul
Hackeu is determined to Construct
a ftrst—class football program. And
he will. Understand that such a
project takes time. But when Pitt's
glory days finally do arrive, the
glory is probably all people will
remember. The building process
will be forgotten. And that is

exactly where the program stands '

at this point in time.

So if you want to watch a
statistical winner, have patience,
or root for someone else.

all arrived this season and
replaced a corps of
defensernen that had been
around too long for too
many heartbreaks (Jim
Johnson, Chris Dahlquist
and Gord Dineen, who
hasn't been officially
removed of his duties, to
name a few).

The new style of play
was no more evident than
in Philadelphia, where Bob
Johnson unleashed his
‘ground birds." Pittsburgh
outworked the Flyers in the
corners and in front of the
net and let the big guns,
Lemieux and Barrasso,
drive them to victory.

over for Curvin," said Van Pelt.
‘And the offensive line is a year
older, a year wiser.”

The same cannot be said for
the wide receivers that Van Pelt is
working with this spring,
however. With Olanda Truitt,
Ricky Turner and Darnell
Dickerson working on their
grades, that leaves junior Green,
Chris llouyer and Chad Askew as
the most experienced receivers
in spring camp.

“You know, I think that could
be a blessing in disguise,” said
Van Pelt.

‘Everybody knows what
Olanda can do and what Darnell
can do. After that, it's a bunch of
questions. But now the younger
guys are thrust into the starting
roles here. Ifthey learn the offense
and can fit in really well, we'll
have a lot of depth at receiver.‘

it was a gloomy dav for the Pitt
Panther baseball team.

The rain caused the Panthers
to play one nine—inning game
instead of the doubleheader that
was planned. This may have
proven beneﬁcial because for
the fourth time in as manv davs,
Pitt couldn't get its bats going in
the right direction.

The Panthers not onlv had to

had to battle the \\'est l.il\ert_v

23, and in the Pcnnysaver the
week ofl"cb. 22, read as follows:

“The l’enr2ySaverapologi7.cS to
all members of the Gay, lesbian,
and Bisexual communities for
having declined to run a personal
ad on behalf ofa person Seeking
a relationship with persons ofthe
same Sex and for any oflense this
refusal may have caused the gay,
lesbian, and bisexual
communities and to the public at
large.

This apology is to discourage
any discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation within our
community and throughout
society at large.”

According to Smith, Pennysaver
did not want to discourage future
discrimination at the publication.

“It is ironic that they printed the
public apology to the bisexual,
lesbian and gay community when
they are still doing this," said
Smith. ‘It was just a token gesture
on their part."

By filing Suit against the
Pennysaver, Smith is attempting
to open doors to others who
have been discriminated against
because of their sexual
orientation.

‘One ofthe reasons why I took
this case was to encourage people
that ifsomething happens to them
based on their sexual identity. to

On April 28, thousands of
graduates will wipe away their
tears of joy, turn around and look
out at a dark and uncertain job
market Students who want to
stand out from the crowd and
land that dream job need
weapons. Ata workshopentitled,
‘Strategies for Tough Times:
Developing a Winning Job
Search,‘ Pitt’s job-placement
service was handing them out.

‘We are trying to make them
the best candidates for whatever
job they are seeking,‘ said em-
ployment counselor Jeff Krosse.

associate director of the placement
service, keep in touch with
qualities that prospective
employers look for in their
employees. According to Krosse,
when employers are ready to
hire, they ask themselves three
basic questions about a
prospective employee; Can you
do the job? Will you do the job?
‘Will you fit in?

Employers find out if you can
do the job by looking at your cov-
er letter and resume. Because re-
cruiters can look at over 100 res-
umes in a day, yours has to stand
out, or you won't have a chance.

"Hie key to writing a good
cover letter is to write as you

According to Perltoski, a good
cover letter has four key points.
First, say something about the
company you are applying to. Do
research on the company and tell
the recruiter why you want to
work there and how you got
interested in the company.

Second, say what you want to
do at the comrnny and in what
division you want to be placed.

Third, impress the recruiter with
an accomplishment. Just pretend
you are talking to the recruiter,
and write a little story. Talk about
what you did, what problems
you encountered and most
importantly, what the results were.

"lhe business world loves to

  

TiPs for Writing successful   resumes and cover lette  

Krosse- ‘Give them numbers or
percentages. They love it.‘

Fourth, politely ask for an
interview, and if the first three
conditions are met, you just might
get one.

Don't try too hard to impress a
recruiter with ﬂowery language,
and above all, stay to the point.

Once you get your foot in the
door with an interesting cover
letter, you must irnprasa recruiter
with the resume itself. It must be
visually dynamic, packed with
information and easy to read.

An important section of the
resume is the part on the very
top: the objective. The objective
sets the tone of the resume and

information about career

Use action verbs like ‘advised
and ‘directed’ when descriﬁng
your experience.

By john Iabrlola
Suﬁ Writer

With the end of the term
approaching, many graduating
seniors are finding that there are
three chotces awaiting them after
graduation

Their lll'Sl choice is to enter the
work force, but with the present
recession, yobs are hard to come
byespecially the ones that college
students have been trained for.
Students who cannot find a lob
can always go to graduate school,
which is becoming the most
popular choice among college
graduates. Finally, students can
work at one job, have interviews
for the iobs for which they have
been trained and apply for
graduate programs

‘After l graduate, I’m going to

Kern ‘i really want to get into

what l learned actually applies
to anything known to man.’

According to Kern, the

said Kern ‘They dont take into

for the lob. For instance. I
interviewed with 3 company for

"Ihe placement service threw

believe, requested technical
mayors, and the placement S(’f\'lCf.’
threw in some psychologists,
some socialwork majors -—-— and
I'm asking myself How»; could I

there are still more opportunities

the lob market is really bad,

said Kern. ‘l had a real hard time.
l had over 20 interviews before I

loafers were replaced with a pair of

The belt and shoes should always be

a black leather belt to Contakes‘ suit.
Soroka also said that the belt should fit

Soroka recommended that black socks
