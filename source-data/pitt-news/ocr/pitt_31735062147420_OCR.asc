Bowman Advises
Parents In Talk

Chancellor Of University Speaks
To 1,100 At Annual Reception

Parents should never expect grati-
tude for personal sacriﬁces made in
order to keep children in school—be-
cause the chances are they won’t get
it.

Above all, they should never make
the mistake of confronting offspring
with, “Look at all I’ve done for you!”
because they only make things worse
with such utterances. _

This timely advice was given 1100
parents of freshman students by Dr.
John G. Bowman at the thirteenth an-
nual Chancellor’s Reception last Fri-
day night in Memorial Hall.

Dr. Bowman expressed sympathy
for parents, explaining that he under-
stood their troubles because he had
raised children of his own.

gtages and beneﬁts should be gained by
going to college, and declared that
life had become so complicated, and
knowledge so much greater in the last
few decades, that it would require a
lifetime to get even a fair smattering
of the total knowledge of the world.
After the ma.in assembly in the Hall,
the visitors were invited upstairs to
meet the chancellor. They were
given the eight weeks’ grades of their

children, and met and consulted with
their instructors.

Refreshments
those present.

Monday night, receptions were held
for parents at both Johnstown and
Erie centers. At Erie, Dr. Stanton C.
Crawford, dean of the College, and F.
W, Shockley of the Extension Division
were guest speakers. At Johnstown,
Dr. Bowman and C. Stanton l3elfour,
director of the Extension Division,
spoke.

Erie and Johnstown centers are ad-
ministered by the Extension Division
of the University.

Pickup In . Steel
Reflected. In. Jobs §
Given Graduates-

The recent announcement by tlic
Bureau of Business Research and the
downtown newspapers to the effect
that conditions in the steel industry.
have greatly improved is borne out-
by a report of J. C. Barton, director of
the University placement bureau. Mr.
‘Barton reveals the fact that all the
members of the June, 1935, graduating
class in metallurgy at the University
have been placed in metallurgical po-
sitions.

Mr. Barton explains that this in-
crease in the steel business, caused by
a.n upturn in business generally, is‘
probably responsible for the demand
for metallurgists.

The members of the class, number-
ing only ﬁve, have been placed in
companies and laboratories of com-
panies that make iron and steel
products in the Pittsburgh district.
They are Vvilliam R. Bond, George J..
Hurlston, C. A. Purbaugh, Joseph E.
Shuck, and J. C. Bowers.

Many graduates of former classes
have also been placed in similar posi-
tions. There exists, in fact, a shortage
of men for the available jobs.

The course in metallurgy offered at
the University rates highly in com-
parison with those of other colleges,
according to Dr. G. R. Fitterer, in-
structor in metallurgy. “The one clif-
ference between this course and those
or other schools, is that the depart-
ment gives a more general course,
keeping an eye on the practical side,
and not overemphasizing one particu-
lar phase of the subject.” -

Rabbi Will Lead 

Worsiiip Service

“Most people today are not in the
mood for giving thanks; rather, the
average person is in a mood of re-
sentiment,” says Dr. Solomon B.
Freehof, Rabbi of the Rodef Shalom
Temple, who will explain this state-
ment in his address, “Thanksgiving
in Times of Crisis,” at the Univer-
sity’s Thanksgiving Vvorship Serv-
ice to be held during the ﬁfth hour
today at the Heinz House.

The Thanksgiving Service is an
annual event sponsored by the
YWCA and the YMCA.

In addition to the address of-
Rabbi Freehof, a quartet from the:
Men’s Glee Club will sing. Mem-
bers of the quartet are: Eugene"-
Burkhart, C36 ; John T. Clark, C36;

 

Vvilliam Cover, C38; and Ralph
Bergemann, EE39.
Thanksgiving Recess

The Thanksgiving. recess, during
which no University classes will be
held, will extend from 4:30 o’clock
this afternoon, through Saturday,
November 30, inclusive. The of-
fices will be closed on Thanksglv-
ing Day but will be open as usual
on Friday and Saturday, November
29 and 30, according to J. G_ Quick,

Panthers Clash With Tartans
In Annual Thanksgiving Day
Battle Tomorrow ‘Afternoon

Band" Switches ,
Tune Schedule

At the game with Carnegie Tech
at the Stadium tomorrow, the Uni-
versity Band will introduce an in-
novation by playing the Alma Mater
at the half-time intermission instead
of after’ the game, thus doing away
with an old tradition of the Univer-
sity.

This policy is being adopted to
avoid confusion incurred by rather
spiritless persons who leave the
stand during the singing of the
Alma Mater when the game is over.

The Band will t‘or1n CIT and UP
before lining up in front of the stu-
dent section and playing. Because
many of the members are going
home for the Thanksgiving recess,
the Band will be reduced to about
100 pieces, according to Captain
Tredennick, marching director of
the organization.

Students Prepare
For Civil Service

Government Course Here Trains
Future Statesmen Of Nation

“Fifteen years from now, govern-
ment service will constitute one of
the major professions,” is the opinion
of Dr. James C. Charlesworth, associ-
ate professor of political science and
director of the government service de-
partment of the University.

The course in government service
here is designed to prepare young men
and women for advanced positions in
the civil service of the national, state,
and city governments.

The course is open to any student
at the University. He may enter only
with the understanding that he is on
probation, and may be dismissed un-
less his grades are well above the
ordinary average of the student body.

There are 80 students registered in
this government training, most of
whom are in the public administration
and foreign service divisions.

“I am wildly astonished that there
are not more persons registered in the
labor relations and public ﬁnance di-
visions,” admitted Dr. Charlesworth,
who has seen the course he founded
established into the curriculum after
three years of effort on his part.

Those who graduate from the course
will receive certiﬁcates certifying
their training for civil service posi-
tions, although the University does
not guarantee anyone a government
position.

Similar courses of study at the
Harvard Graduate School of Business
Administration, Princeton University,
and Johns Hopkins University are not
as strictly prescribed as the one of-
fered here, according to Dr. Charles-
worth.

Dr. Charlesworth expects the course
in governmental service here and in
other schools to contribute to civil
service reform in local and state gov-
ernment. He adds that in the na-
tional government there is a slight
possibility that examinations will em-
phasize general ability at the expense
of speciﬁc training.

Coliege Association. Timnicsgieing Formal ,
Taites Place At Grotto Ballroom Tonigiit

Tonight at 9 o’clock some Univer-
sity couples, dressed in formal attire,
will be dancing to the music of Dick
Gaertner’s Orchestra a.t the College
Association Thanksgiving Eve formal.

Some couples will be there. As the.
evening wears 011 a bit more and more
will appear until the expected 500
couples are swinging about the floor.
Those who pursue a popular policy of
being “fashionably” late will just miss
so much of what the cabinet promises
is “an excellent orchestra for a con-
sistently excellent affair.”

Paul-Keiser, ’36, president of the
association, will escort Beverly‘
Brown, '37, cabinet member and to-
night’s dance queen, to the affair, but,
as usual, a grand march just wo11‘t be
done.

Tickets will remain on sale through-
out the day in the office of the College.
Room 205, State Hall, in the office of
the dean of men, Room 801, Cathedral,
and with members of the cabinet.

Tonight's formal -wind; up the as-
sociation’s social program for the
semester. Receipts from these affairs
go to make up a popular loan fund
conducted by the CA for needy stu-
dents in the School. V

The Grotto Ballroom on the North
Side, the scene-of__the formal, will
comfortably accommodate up to 7_00
couples,‘ asserts the committee, and

couples appear.

Urges Students
To Submit W0 rk

“VVe intend to do everything in our
power except discourage those under-
graduates who know they can, or
think they might, or doubt whether
they could, write the script and com-
pose the lyrics and melodies for the
coming Cap and Gown production,”
says Bernard Rosenson, ’34, chairman
of the alumni committee in charge.

The committee will advise students.
examine any material submitted, and
listen to any l.yric and melodies.

Student authors and composers
must have their manuscripts complete
and ready for submission by January
15. Before then they may propose
questions or ask for help from the
committee by stopping in at the of-
ﬁce of Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant
dean of men, Room 801, Cathedral.

The committee wishes to warn
against excess budget requirements
and excess love scenes. Emphasis on
comical situations rather than wise-
cracks, a plot with several threads.
and novel angles or ideas, are what
should be aimed at, the advisers sug-
gest.

Besides Rosenson, the committee in-
cludes: Charles Foreman, ’35: Louis

Local Grid Season.
For Both Teams

Coach I-Iarpster Hopes For First
Plaid Victory In Seven Years;
Ten Seniors On Pitt Squad

By Harry E. Robinson

Turkeys, cranberries, pumpkin
pies, and all other dishes that go
to make up a Thanksgiving Day
feast will be put aside for a few
hours tomorrow afternoon while
the district football fans follow
the trail to the Stadium where
the Panthers and Tartans of Car-
negie Tech will put on their an-
nual holiday attraction in the
home finale of the season for both
teams.

A crowd of approximately 30,000 is
expected to watch the wearers of the
Plaid give their ﬁnal show of the year.
For the Pitt outﬁt it will mark the
semi-ﬁnal windup on its grid card, as

the Panthers still have Southern Cali-
fornia to worry about on December 14.

Coach Harpster’s aggregation has
been idle for the past couple of weeks,
and with every member of the Skibo
clan except Fryer in tip-top shape for
the battle, the Tartans will be able to
present their strongest lineup for the
first time this season.

LaRue May ‘Not Start"

The Panthers will be less fortunate
in that respect because it is doubtful
whether Bob LaRue, regular right
halfback, will be able to start, having
been injured in the Nebraska contest.
In his place Leon Shedlosl-:y_. snake-
hipped speedster, will give his ﬁnal
home performance for the Blue and
Gold. ,

As far as records go, the Pitt ledger
shows a decided advantage. This has
been one of the worst seasons that
Tech has ever experienced, losing ﬁve
games out of seven. However, the
teams holding decisions over the Kil-
ties are all top-ranking elevens this
season, so that the Carnegie record
does not look so bad when consider-
ing the high standard of its opponents.

Notre Dame, Temple, N.Y.U., Du-
quesne, and Holy Cross have taken
the Plaid’s measure in games this fall,
the undefeated Violets handing out
the worst trouncing of 25-6. The Irish
and Owls were a.ble to penetrate the
Tartans’ goal line - twice, while the
Dukes and Crusaders eked out one
touchdown victories. Case‘ and Pur-
due were Carnegie’s Victims-

Educators Meet
At Frick School

Typing, Stenographic Champions
Demonstrate For Convention

More than 400 people from Pennsyl-
Vania, West Virginia and Ohio attend-
ed the sessions of the convention held
by the Tri-State Commercial Educa-
tion Association at Frick Training
School Saturday, according to Dr. E.
G. Miller, director of commercial edu-
cation in Pittsburgh.

Albert Tangora, world’s champion
and Helen Dols, of Detroit,
lvlichigan, winner of the 200-word—a-
minute award in stenography, gave
the principal exhibitions of the con-
vention at the general meeting in the
afternoon, following the various sec-
tional meetings in the morning.

Mr. Tangora performed the never-
before-accomplished feat of typing out
153 words a minute, and simultaneous-
ly adding up a problem of four ﬁgures
across and ﬁve deep, as it was called
off to him. After 45 seconds he gave:
the total answer and ﬁnished his min-
utes typing.

Miss Dols turned into shorthand a
flow of words at 140, 175, 200, and 250
a minute. For two minutes she
copied 300 words per minute and-zthen
read them all back correctly.

George Hossﬁeld, world’s champion
typist for eight consecutive years be-
fore this year, attended as a guest.

Exhibitions of latest oﬁice equip»
ment displayed a.t the convention were
above average, according to Dr. Miller.

Door prizes were distributed.

Thanks Without Reservations

ROM NOIV ON until the last turkey bone is
Fscraped clean tomorrow, people everywhere
are going to be telling other people every-
where, “Let us give thanlazs.” And it has always
seemed to us that college people in general listen
to those suggestions while doing a bit of business
known as sticking the tongue in the cheek.
Perhaps we are wrong in supposing that most
of us silently amend the “Let us give thanks”
statements by a concise “For what?” It does
seem, however, that we are too apt to ponder the
question: Vilhy does the other fellow have so
much more he can be thankful for than we have?

Tliereare some who advocate a walk through
the slums of the city as a very beneﬁcial pre-
Thanksgiving Day venture; others contend that a
visit to various types of hospitals will show every
visitor that he has much for wl1icl1 he can offer
thanks.

It is the rare college student indeed who can-
not look around him and observe many others
whose lot is far less ﬁne than his, no matter how
many others hold advantages above him.

Let us then give thanks, without reservations
and without tongue in cheek. The worship serv-
ice at Heinz House today might be a ﬁne place to
start.

Freedom, But Not Abuse
(From The Daily Texan)
AN EDITORIAL on drinking is hard to write. It might
have the tendency to intrude on someone’s right-
his right to make a jackass of himself if he wants to.

All students have this right. They have the right to
be just as disgusting as they please. to slobber all over
their vests, and to endanger their hea.lth. No one would
deprive a man—or even a woman——of that right.

But students do not have the right to make football
games uncomfortable for spectators. They have no right
to make the streets dangerous for other persons. They
have no right to encourage the use of the Stadium as :1
bar for outsiders who are ashamed to drink at home
where their respectable friends and associates might see
them. ~ . " '

If people want any
learn not to abuse whatever freedom they have been al-
lowed. The University puts students on their own to act
like intelligent humans on occasions. A football game
is one of those times. If students want to retain the
privilege of taking care of themselves at football games,
the best way they can do so is to show that they can
take care of themselves and can act intelligent even
if some of them are not.

‘Nichevo’ Gasps Prima Ballerina Danilova
As Pitt’s 19 Scintillate In

‘Scheherazade’

By Ron

The last bars of Rirnsky-Korsakov’s
music for “Scheherazade” rose to a
crescendo as Zobeide, favorite wife of
Shariar, King of India and China,
plunged the dagger into her breast
and died with the eloquence of a mas-
ter pantomimist.

Terriﬁc applause thundered, as it
were. from a large crowd at Syria
Mosque. The principals of the Monte
Carlo Ballet Russe’s most popular
ballet suite: Lubov Tchernicheva,
Leonide Massine, Serge Grigorielf,
Marc Platoff, Vania Psota, Eugenie
Delarova, Nathalie Branitska, and
Nina Verchinina (whew lino-
typer, watch them consonants!) took
curtain call after curtain call—seven
in all. During this time, the rest of
the cast melted off the stage to allow
the principals all the glory-.

That is, the rest of the cast but for
l.9 stalwart students from the Univer-
sity, making their debut in the big-
time of ballet. There they stood, all
19, resplendent in elaborate oriental
costumes of bright purple, saffron, red
and orange, with immense headgear
and ﬂashing cardboard swords, bow-
ing seven times, winking at the par-
quet circle.

Some of them had crashed the
realms of sophisticated dramatic art
three years ago in grand opera, ap-
pearing in “Aida.” Some others had
had experience in “Carmen” and other
operas. But for all, this was the ﬁrst
taste in “the most sophisticated form
of art"—ba.llet.

“Marvelous, marvelous,” murmured,
Alexandra Danilova, premiere u..i.ll‘J"
rina of the outstanding ballet troupe in
the world, as Pitt’s “arteests” trod
heavily from the stage.

“Thrilling,” commented an audi-
ence favorite, Irena Baranova.

“Convincing and majestic,” con-
curred David Lichine and Tatiana

Riabouchinska, who thrilled a packed 

house at the evening performance in
“The Marriage of Aurora.”

“VVe thought we were ballet good.
too,” cracked Gene Burkhart, C36, who
was one of the 19.

Friday afternoon, a rush call from
the University Placement Bureau to
Charles B. Holstein, C36, for a group

one seemed to know) for the ballet

group, resulted in Room 709, Cathe-
dral, the activities wing, and a few
fraternity houses being ransacked of
talent——men to whom the idea of tak-
ing part in ballet with perhaps no pay
whatsoever attached—to sign up for
parts.

Saturday at the Mosque, the secretary
of the Monte Carlo Company chose
three from the 19 men for special, very
important, dramatic parts, divided the
other 16 into two groups of soldiers,
put all 19 through their paces in 20
minutes of rehearsal, and sent up a
fervent prayer that these “collitcli”
boys from Pittsburgh wouldn't gum up
the works. The “collitch” boys came
through, no works were gummed.
everyone was happy, and unexpected
remuneration in the form of $1 bills
found ready acceptance.

Holstein. James McCormick, C38.
and Jack Dannels, E36, were placed in
the responsible positions of ﬁrst as-
sistant eunuchs to the Sultan,
salaamed at the proper times (once
losing their gigantic headgears in the
process), buckled swords and breast-
plates on Grigorieff and Platoff, stran-
gled the chief eunuch (the marvelous-
ly agile Psota), and concluded their
work by threatening to daggerize
Tchernicheva, and, on her suicide.
looking ferocious and very moral.

The others came trotting on at a
cue, stood a bit, trotted off, trotted
back on, brandishing swords and kill-
ing slaves and wives right and left.
and reached the ﬁnale in a burst of
dramatic immobility. Seven curtain
calls found them still impressive and
not too graceful.

Below are some of those who tripped
about with the ballet’s ﬁnest. Not all
19 are included—«some, including a
popular young instructor, feel the pub-
licity not timely. But, to continue,
here they are: Charles Roofner, C38;

that headline?

Olsonmen Finish
Season With Win
Over Navy, 18-37

Tost Registers Second Individual
Senior AMA Team Victory;
Frosh Squad Cops Title

 

By Edwin Beachler

Harold Tost’s victory in the Navy
meet climaxed probably the most re-
markable season in Panther cross-
country history as Coach Olson’s var-
sity subdued the big Midshipmen’s
guns, 18-37, in the harrier chase
through the four and one-half mile
den at Schenley Park, Saturday.

This big red-headed hill-topper from
Plumville. Pa.. scored his second tri-
umph of the year in a convincing
fashion, by negotiating the short
course in 23 minutes and 38 seconds.
George Cook, a junior classmate,
trailed by some 200 yards at the ﬁnish.

As Tost ﬁnished, so did the Olson-
men place in the four dual contests of
the season. In the ﬁrst two meets
with Notre Dame and Penn State, re-
spectively, Tost constantly threatened
in the second position, corresponding
to the Pitt team place on the score
sheets.

In the Butler and recent Navy
climbs, the Jungle Cats avenged those
two early losses, with Tost likewise
assuming the ﬁrst—place position.

Bolam from Annapolis never seri-
ously threatened the Pitt leader, Satur-
day, but. pushed Cook plenty in the
last mile downhill stretch from the
golf fairway to the fish pond at the
foot of the hill. Alex Leggin, Pitt,
ﬁnished fourth.

Charley Groat. University record-
holder in the half-mile, wound up a
short, but brilliant two years of cross-
country competition in ﬁfth place. He
is the only senior on the squad.

Franklyn Theriault, sophomore ace,
was right on Groat’s heels in sixth
position to clinch the meet for the
Panthers. Others who ﬁnished in the
ﬁrst 10 included: Weymotitli, Navy,
seventh; Young, Navy, eighth; Sco-
ﬁeld, Navy, ninth; and Emens, Pitt,
tenth.

Gedwilas Repeats

As in the Junior event earlier in
the year, Barney Gedwilas proved to
be just too good for hill—and-dalers in
this section of the country by com-
pleting the three and one-half mile
run in 22 minutes and 34 seconds to
add the Senior AMA championship to
his impressive list of titles.

The veteran Mountaineer‘, a junior
in the 1‘/Iorgantown university, won by
more than a half-mile margin to the
amazement of the AMA officials and
handful of spectators grouped about
the ﬁnish at the foot of Flagstaff hill.

Pinkerton of Tech who placed third
behind Tost in the Junior event moved
up a position in Saturday’s title-race.
Johnny Vvoodruff, correspondiiigly, ad-
vanced to the third notch, three better
than his performance two weeks ago.

Yearllngs Win Title

Coach Pott’s frosh-aggregation was
offered no opposition as it swept the
team title with a perfect 15-point to-
tal. Bonorati, Pitt frosh, turned in a
ﬁne performance with a fourth, fol-
lowed by a yearling teammate, Filson.

Giolma, former Tech runner and
Junior title-holder in 1934, disappoint-
ed his Plaid followers by ﬁnishing
sixth. Zamborsky and Cogswell in
seventh and ninth positions, respec-
tively, rounded out the scoring for the
fresh champions. Mazzei, unattached,
ﬁnished eighth, and Connelly, Pitt
jayvees, was the tenth man.

Canonsburg’s WPIAL . title-holders
were crowned PIAA champs when
they took the State meet with a total
of 39 points at 1 o’clock, Saturday.

Pressing the winners closely was
Allderdice High School, city champs,
with just three markers more than
the Canonsburg High boys. Evans
City ﬁnished third with 84 points, fol-
lowed by Aliquippa, Meadville, and
Georges Township. ~_ -

Bobby Nea1.‘Lansford’s lone entry,
gained the-individual title, ﬁnishing in
the good time of 11 minutes and 56
seconds for the two-mile Flagstaff hill
course in Schenley park. The Uni-
versity sponsored this State titular
event.

Carlson Decrees
Three-Day Rest

Ca-gers Remain Idle Until Practice
Game At Akron, Saturday

 

Giving the boys a chance to do some
heavy duty with a carving knife on
Thanksgiving, Dr. Carlson, Panther
cage coach, has called a respite from
varsity basketball drills for the last
three days of this week.

The Panther cagers have practiced
rather extensively during the past.
month and the good doctor feels that
the basketeers have earned a short
vacation. However, they will be back
together again Saturday when they
leave for Akron and their practice

battle with the Akron Goodyear cagers‘

on Saturday night.

This game, now becoming an animal
affair. is played to aid Dr. Carlson
smooth out his team's faults and to
give the doctor a line on his starting
varsity when the Panthers line up
against the W&J cagers in the open-
7. Although
there have been other practice games
thus far for the Panther squad against
local amateur ﬁves, this will be the
first time for a. regular score with
lineups for publication being kept.

Carlson still is uncertain (we wish
we had a nickel for everytime we
wrote this) as to thei*makeup"of his
starting ﬁve. It’s about as doubtful
as trying to dope out what the Marx
brothers are going to do next. A

good guess as to the ﬁve starters this ‘

Saturday against Akron would have
Radvansky, Johnson, Garcia, Roderick
and Jesko in there at the starting
whistle with Zeleznik, Noon, . and
Spotoﬁtch as alternates.

Panthers, Tartans
Battle Tomorrow

(Continued from Page One)
when the starting whistle blows at 2
o’clock. Moore, a senior, will play his
last game for the clan. At tackles,
“Jurk” Hall and Nester Henrion will
get the nod, while Frank Chyczekski
and Jock Sutherland will line up in
the guard positions. Co-captain Steve
Trbovich will wind up a brilliant
career at the pivot job.

Co-captain Steve Terebus heads the
list of backﬁeld starters. Another
Tartan standout this season, Charley
Spisak, closes his third year at the
quarterback post. Rosie Rosenthal at
right half and Napotnik at fullback
will ﬁll the other two posts.

The Panthers will start the same
lineup that faced the Cornhuskers ex-
cept at right halfback where Shed-
losky will take care of the duties.

Ten Blue and Gold players will say
goodbye to the local fans, these being
Kliskey, Sites, Shedlosky, Detzel,
Rector, McCue, Stark, ll/olgemuth,
Schindel, and Random‘.

    

‘ HUB RANDOUR
The Hub that makes the wheel go
’round.

For Random‘, it will mark the cli-
max of a brilliant season. Hub has
been one of the standouts on the team
this fall, and his performances against
Notre Dame, Army, and Nebraska
should make him ripe for All-Ameri-
can consideration.

Kliskey at center has been another
bright spot on the forward wall, as
have been Sites and Detzel. Shed-._
losky, probably the most spectacular‘
ball-carrier on the team, gets a chance
tomorrow to show his stuff for the
last time. The other seniors, while
not regulars, have been outstanding
in an “unwritten” way, and their loss
is sure to be felt.

With LaRue out of action, the Pan-
thers will send an entirely new eleven
against the Tartans as compared with
last year’s. Patt and Trbovich are
the only two Tech players in the open-
ing lineup tomorrow who started in
last fall’s annual clash.

ll/iilligan’s Yearling Eleven Entrains
For Turkey Day Clash With Middies

 

“Sink the Navy, Sink the Navy,
Now!" is the tune 26 freshman foot-
ballers were singing as they boarded
the bus for Annapolis this morning.
Tomorrow, the Little Panthers will
play their ﬁfth and last game of the
season when they clash with the Navy
Plebes.

Mike Milligan is hoping to ﬁnish his

first season as freshman grid coach,

successfully, and a victory over the
Plebes will give him three victories
against two defeats, for a fairly good
season’s record.

The Little Panthers found the going
pretty tough in the early games this
season, losing to the Carnegie Tech
Plebes, 3-0, in the season’s opener.
In the next contest the Little Panthers

only team able to boast of a victory
over the Plebes is the Penn State
l'rosh, who upset them two weeks ago
and went back to State College with
a 19-6 victory.

Among their ﬁve conquests the
Plebes took over Kiski, the same team
that beat the Little Panthers, 27-0.
Last week the boys from Maryland
ziﬁilamerged the Erasmus Hall eleven,

Coach Milligan and his band of Lit-
tle Panthers left Pittsburgh at 6:30
o'clock this morning by bus, and will
arrive at Annapolis this evening in
time for dinner at the Academy. They
will stay at their quarters in the
Academy over night. Immediately
following the game, scheduled for
10:30 o’clock, the Little Panthers will
return to Pittsburgh, arriving late
Thursday night.

at the University to the trustees, that
the ﬁrst women were admitted. This
was more than one hundred years
after the founding of the University.

nent women leaders to feature VVom-
en’s Day celebrations. This year Miss
St. Denis will speak and then inter-
pret her speech in dance.

Miss St. Denis is the head of her
own school of dancing. She 1_S_ the
founder of the Society Of SIJ11'1f-119-1
Arts.and Society for the Friends of
the Dance. She is also the author of
“Lotus Light,” a book of verse. _

She has toured Europe. the Onents
and the United States since she began
dancing professionally» in 1906. She
was born in Newark, New Jersey.

Women’s Day is planned by the t_1'a'
ditions committ.ee of WSGA Wlth
Elinor Scott, E'd37, as chairman. A11

memorating their entrance into the

Group Discusses
Rushing Methods

Fraternity Women Hear Substitute
Plans For Luncheon System

 

 

 

A special meeting to discuss rush-
ing problems was called yesterday by
the women’s fraternities committee.
The group consists of active and as-
sociate representatives of Panhellenic
Council_ presidents and rushing chair-
men of women’s fraternities. and
members of the women’s faculty
committee including: Dr. Lotte
Lohstoeter, assistant professor of
modern languages; Thyrsa VV. Amos,
dean of women; Helen Poole Rush,
assistant dean of women; Ellen Geyer,
profes.==or of English and education;
and Blossom Henry, assistant pro-
fessor of modern languages.

This joint meeting was held at
Heinz House at 12:30 o’clock.

Various phases of the methods used
by women’s fraternities at the Univer-
sity for rushing prospective members
were treated.

Substitutes for the system of rush-
ing by luncheon engagements were
suggested. Among the suggestions
was the ')lan for open house to be held
by the Council at which fraternity
women may become better acquainted
‘with those women who are eligible for
rushing.

Louise Kelly, C36, treasurer of Pan-
hellenic, and Jean Lawson, C36, sec-
retary, are making investigations con-
cerning the Panhellenic scholarship
quota. Plans for honoring outstand-
ing scholars of fraternities are being
formulated.

‘Back To The Farm’

Movement Proves

E n 0}‘ a bl e To 28 Rural Sociologists

 

“VVe don't get to the farm often
but when we do—-” is the sentiment
among 28 rural sociology students
this week after an excursion into the
wide open spaces planned, by Dr.
David B. Rogers, assistant professor
of sociology. The purpose was to
give the class an idea of the structure
and organization of rural life.

Even though some members of the
class had been on Uncle Ben; and Aunt
Tillie’s farm and knew: the-difference
between a pig. and an elk and: some-
thing about farm life, they were not
prepared for the welcome and inside
slant on rural life that 28. Washington
county farmers and their families, the
Ladies Aid of the Deemston Methodist
Church, and Washington. County
Emergency, Relief .ad'ministr'ators gave
them.

After the class- had gatheredat
Bentleyville, they proceeded -to Bealls-
ville, where each» me_m_ber of-the cla.ss
was taken to a diﬁerent farmer’s
home somewhere in the general vi-
cinity.

Here, armed with a sheet of ques-
tions, each student started to discover
how his farm" family was related to
the community in general, but it
wasn’t all work. There were plenty
of glimpses of real farm life including
pig-butchering, and visits to a cider
press.

One of the farmers told of a sum-
mer visitor who thought strawberries
grew on trees but he didn’t ﬁnd his
Saturday guest quite so stupid.

At-noon the class had a chicken
and biscuit dinner with all the ﬁxin’s
preparedand. servedby the ladies of
the»Deemiston Methodist Church. To
top itoffthere was‘ whipped. cream
covered pie, a three by four inch slice
of ginger bread,-and spiced peaches.-
This didnot mean a choice of one.
either; it meant all three.

The afternoon itinerary included a
trip to a grange hall and a look into
a general store where the proprietor,
joined, by -the class, bet Dr. Rogers he
wouldn’t wea.r a farmer-’s' straw hat
back to the city. They lost.

Bandleader Giles:
Helped Organize
Band Here In ’15

College men, apparently, make the
best band leaders. Hal Kemp, Fred
Vi-’a1-ing, Glen Gray, Kay Kyser, and
others show the effects of a college
education as applied to jazz orches-
tras.

Not to be outdone, Art Giles. who
plays for the Freshman Dance on De-
cember 6, is also a grad——and of the
University at that. He was graduated
from the College in 1915.

Giles was active on campus as a
player on the baseball team, now ex-
tinct. and as a charter member of the
SAE fraternity. He was mainly re-
sponsible for the organization of the
first University Band, even soliciting
subscriptions from alumni and others
to pay for the uniforms.

His dance orchestra was formed in
1912 from a group of fellow students
who have played together ever since.

The present 11-piece orchestra has
had engagements at the Everglades
Club, Palm Beach, Florida, the Fox
Chapel Country Club, the Pittsburgh
Country Club, and is now broadcast-
ing over VVJAS twice a week.

Giles and Ray Jackson, featured
tenor vocalist, have promised to an-
swer request numbers from you and
you and you.

The committee will meet today in

 

Room 813, Cathedral, at 3:30 o’clock.

‘It was‘ a happy day for me when I turned
