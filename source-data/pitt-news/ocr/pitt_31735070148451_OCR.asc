Student leaders from Pitt, Penn
State, Temple and Lincoln univer-
sities convened Saturday and fo-
cused on a new voter registration
law that may affect students at

'Pennsylvania’s four state-related

schools. >

The Pennsylvania Association
of State-Related Students, an or-
ganization forged by the student
governments of the four schools
in December 2010, organized the
four-hour conference in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.‘ The purpose of
PASS is to represent the schools
in Pennsylvania’s legislature on
any issue that affects students at
these schools and includes more
than 20 student leaders.

The conference mostly focused
on the proposed bill that would
amend the current Pennsylvania
Election Code. PASS is against
the bill because members think
it will make students less likely
to vote in elections, particularly
out—of—state students who could
be required to get a Pennsylva-
nia ID.

Brenden Dooley, the at—large
representative and Vice chair-
man of governmental relations
from Penn State, said the bill

would discourage out—of—state I

students from voting because stu-
dents would have to go through
too many steps to obtain valid
photo IDs. ‘

The 48—degree, rainy weather on Sat-
urday afternoon didn’t stop the orga-
nizers of Pitfs armual Fall Fest from
constructing a campus carnival.

Pitt’s aimual festival traditionally v

has students ﬁll Bige1ow-Boule‘vardbe-

and Pitt-Tac-Toe.

' Pitt Program Council publicized the
event’s last-minute change of location
by handing out ﬂyers in Towers lobby
and postingsigns around Market Cen-
tralonthe day of the event. p

Taylor Steffey, a PPC member
working at Fall Fest, said the turnout
indoors wasn’t what the organization
had hoped for. P

“I thought there would be a higher
turnout  It’s the weather,” Steffey
said.

Butstudents waitinginline forspray
painted T-shirts were disappointed —
the booth ran out of T-shirts within
the ﬁrst hour and, a halfof the event.
Attendees included a constant ﬂow
of students to the different activities,

at a time.

PPC member Lindsay Lehrman also
said thatthe low number of students in
attendancewasn’twhat shewas expect-

“We don’thave aperformerbecause
we wanted to focus on the

The Program Council was able to

thrill rides, which were not available
for the event.

Fall Fest’s carnival theme made
some college students feelyoungagain.

Bill affects voters

PASS 4 1

. idenytiﬁcationlaw, which is included 

the amended bill, states that one formiof
identiﬁcation can be a valid student iden-
tiﬁcation card. However, the amended bill
does not make clear what makes a valid
student ID, or whether an ID issued by
one of the state—related schools would be
considered valid.

The bill also states at separate places
that valid ID must be issued by the state or
federal government, but also that an em-
ployment ID would be considered valid.

Currently, Pennsylvania voters are not
required to show ID at the polls, unless
they are ﬁrst—time voters.

Pitt senior and Student Government
Board President Molly Stieber said that the
bill is “making a huge nuisance” for out-of-
state students from these schools, as the
bill would discourage vot_er turnout.

“[The bill is] not [targeted] directly
toward state—related universities, but we
have a lot of out—of—state students here, and
we’re always recruiting more,” Stieber said.
“College students are already apathetic.
They don’t go out and vote, and therefore
there’s no reason for state legislators to
cater toward our needs. We’re trying to
encourage more students to vote.”

The Pennsylvania Budget and Policy .

Center estimates that the state will spend
more than $11 million in the first year of
the voter ID program for such things as
public education, training of poll workers
and provision that would provide photo ID
cards for free from the state Department
of Transportation.

Pitt seniors Alex Zimmerman, an SGB
Board member, and Kyle Miller, SGB gov-
ernmental relations committee chairman,
are responsible for draftingthe opposition
on behalf of PASS to oppose the bill.

Zimmerman and Miller said that af- .

ter they draft their statement of opposi-
tion they will send it around to the other
schools to make sure they agree with it,
before sending it to the state.

The leaders also discussed an upcom-

“It’s important’ to have everymajor

university in the state of Pennsylvania
representing and rallying in__Harrisburg,”
Stieber said. .“Last year, thelperformancesb
were really well-received and showedhow
creative, diverse and cultural our students
are.” .
As of now, there is no set date for the
rally, but the student representatives said
they plan to have a more structured rally
than last year that would incorporate

speakers. This rally will be separate from

each school’s individual rally.
“We” need to think of creative ways to
approach these legislators,” Pitt senior

and SGB Board member Lauren Jentleson _

said.

Elliot Griffin, a representative from
Temple University, also proposed the idea
of a voter registration “week of action,”

driven by recent appropriations bills and

the new voter registration bill. The event
will aim to get students to vote by placing
an emphasis on issues that affect them.

PASS representatives are aiming to"h'oI‘di '

the event on each of their individual cam-
puses by the end of November.

Brandon Harris, Student Government
Association’s president pro tempore from
Lincoln University, said that the confer-
ence went well. V

“It helped toformalize who [the state— _

related schools] are,” Harris said. “[Lin—
coin] is a small school.”

DeWayne Walker Jr., Student Govern-
ment Association’s vice president of ‘in-
ternal affairs from Lincoln, said that the
meeting was divided amongst the four
schools at the beginning, but “as it went
on, we came together with ideas.”

Lincoln will be hosting the next PASS]
conference. There is no set date for the
meeting yet, but Stieber said it will most

likely take place in January or February.I ,

EDITORIAL

Teaching civil rights 
 still essential 

Many people born after the 1960s
associate the civil rights move-
ment with a few stock images:
marches, ﬁre hoses and, of course,
Martin Luther Kingjr. delivering
speeches. Too often, however, the
story behind these snapshots is
poorly understood. ._
The Southern Poverty Law
Center believes it’s discovered the
source of our superﬁcial knowl-
edge: negligent public schools.
Ina newly released report, the
anti—discrimination group eval-
uatedthow much states’ educa-
tional standards emphasize the
civil rights movement and then

graded them accordingly on a '

scale of A through F. Appallingly,
35 states, including Pennsylva-
nia, received F’s. (Only New York,

Alabama and Florida, all of which I

mandate" teaching the subject,
earned A’s). I
. Although some academics pro-

test that state standards are sparse
bynecessity — lack of detail, they

argue, grants individual school
districts more freedom to tailor
lesson plans — there’s no disput-
ing other evidence of historical
illiteracy. On the National Assess-
ment of Educational Progress, for
instance, high school seniors were
asked to read an excerpt from the
1954 Brown v. Board of Education
ruling that included the phrase,

“Separate educational facilities A

are inherently unequal.” Only 2

percent were then able to iden-

tify that a school segregation case

prompted the ruling.

Astounding as all this sounds,
it’s easy to see why teaching the
civil rights movement might not
be a state’s top educational pri-
ority: Our president is black and
black Americans occupy top of-
ﬁces in countless professions.
Whenever public ﬁgures make
racist remarks, they’re swiftly and
surely condemned. In our enlight-
ened — or, in the words of certain,
pundits, “post-racial” — era, why
reopen old wounds? _

Simply put: Because the wounds

» have yet to heal, and because there

are other civil rights crises that

have yet to be resolved. .'

The state of black rights,
though improved, is farfrom ideal.
According to 2005 U.S. Census Bu-
reau statistics, roughly one in 10

‘ young black men are in prison —

far more, percentage-wise, than

I other ethnicities. More troubling

still, a 2004 Cornell study found
that blacks who murder whites
receive the highest rate of death
sentences across the board, as op-
posed to, for instance, whites who
murder blacks. Put succinctly, al-
though we no longer segregate
fountains or ask that blacks move
to the back of the bus, institution-
alized racism still exists. In order
to eradicate it, it’s necessary to
examine the precedent previous
leaders have set.

There are other demographics
whose causes are only now gain-
ing traction and who would also

rights movement. The obvious
example here is the LGBTQ com-
munity, which has only been able '
to make deﬁnitive strides towards
equal treatment in the past few
years — most recently with the
repeals of Don’t Ask,'Don’t Tell
and’ heterosexual-only marriage
in New York. Even still, certain
politicians, like former Pennsylva-
nia Sen. Rick Santorum, champion
a reinstatement of some of these
measures; a large portion of their
constituencies would likely sup-
port this. a -
Proponents of other causes,
such as women’s rights and animal
rights, have even more to accom-
* plish. New injustices, new ﬁghts
continually present themselves,
demanding action and legislation.

_ alarming considering that we’re entering

an era in which science will intersect with
public policy to a greater extent than ever
before. .

However, I didn’t graduate from a ﬁne
American public high school to not realize
that the editorial’s argument commits the
“post ho_c ergo propter hoc” fallacy assum-
ing that correlation is causation. I’d point
out, for instance, that in Shanghai, China,

a program that seeks to use computers and
technology is onlyas good as its underlying
design. To make the most of technology, it
would be useﬁil to re—examine the curriculum
so that there is more focus on harnessing
technology itself. Otherwise all we will ac-
complish is. a shift from ﬂashcards written
on index cards to the iFlash program that
does the same thing but costsgmore.

This assumes that the teachers even use

Onething people often forget
aboutcomputers and technology is
that their output is only as good as  

the input.     O 

Students don’t even typically type papers 
and Shanghai’s students kick our butts in
education, too. a

I’m not about to argue that we should
teach everybody how to add on abaci, that
papers should all be written in Spencerian
cursive and that the ﬁrst time a student
should see a computer is in graduate school.
Every child should have access to a computer,
and perhaps in low-income districts where
children don’t have a computer at home,
it would make sense to ‘distribute laptops.
But we’ve become enchanted with technol—
ogy, presuming it to be the answer to all our
educational problems when it is not.

Some skills cannot be taught through the
use of technology. A word processor is good
to have, but a word processor doesn’t make
a writer. There’s no substitute for grind-
ing through multiple drafts with a red pen
and having students read examples of good
writing. Similarly, although students can
do arithmetic with calculators, if all they’re
taught is how to blindly punch in numbers,
they’ll sometimes ﬁnd answers that are not
only wrong but preposterously wrong. There
is value in being able to estimate. There is
also a need to be able to do simple arith-
metic on pad and paper, or come to a rough
estimate in one’s head while standing in the

. supermarket. Computers will not make ob-

taining these skills any easier.
One thing people often forget about com-

  99

the technology at all. I remember the big
deal one of my schools made about “cable in
the classroom,” where every classroom got
a TV hooked up to cable. We never watched
the TV unless it was for a video, and the
school spent a lot of money. on an unused
subscription. My high school also rolled out
tablet PCs to great fanfare and hoopla, as
it was expected that teachers would work
magic with those touchscreens. One teacher
of mine actually used his tablet in class for
something other than entering attendance.

Allthe other teachers, however, treated it_

as a second computer and continued using
chalk and overhead slides. That was what
‘ the teachers were used to. Ultimately, it’s not
enough to dump a bunch of technology into
the classroom and expect results.
I do not blame people for supposing that
technology is going to solve our educational
- problems, particularly because it’s a much
easier solution than what really needs to
be done: improving the pay of good teach-
ers, ﬁring incompetent ones, securing our
schools from violence, making the desire
for education something respectable in the
inner cities and keeping parents involved
and interested in the educational system.
These changes are going to take time, effort
and good faith from many parties. There’s
no app for that. :

Junior running back Ray Graham (No. 1) ran for 226 yards and added 42 receiving yards in ‘Pitt’s 44-17 win over South Floridaat Heinz Field Thursday night,

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

If Ray Graham’s 201 yards against
Buffalo last month was the open-
ing act, Thursday’s performance
against the South Florida Bulls
was the main event.

Graham accounted for -over
half of Pitt’s total offense in
Thursday night’s 44-17 win over
No. 16 South Florida, rushing for
226 yards, gaining 42 more on
four receptions and returning
two kicks for 35.

Needless to say, Pitt head.

coach Todd Graham found the
primary weapon for his up -tem-
po offense. ‘
“He runs all over the field,
and then he comes over and he’s
cheering on the kickoff team,”
Todd Graham said in a press
conference after the game. “He
demanded that he return th

, kickoffs.” -  - I ~

In a playbook that features
quarterbacks punting and re-
ceiving and receivers rushing
and passing, Todd Graham said
there’s only one constant in his
offensive scheme: Give the ball
to Ray. ‘

“To be real honest with you in
how we plan, we want so many
times for the ball to be touched
by No. 1 [Ray Graham], and then
everybody else we’re dispersing
it based on what they give us,”
he said.

The junior from Elizabeth,
N.]., has had between 28 and 33.
touches rushing and receiving in
every game this year. -

That game plan, though,

.didn’t have him returning kicks

until he told the coaching staff
he wanted that duty, too.

“Coach [Graham] kept say-
ing that he needs somebody out
there that’s good at it and can
do it, and I told him I’d do it,”
Ray Graham said after the game.
“Anything I can do to help the
team win, I’ll do it.”

After ﬁve weeks of play, Gra- »

ham leads the nation with 734
rushing yards, 57 more than
South Carolina’s Marcus Lat-

‘timore and 235 more than any

other Big East back. His total-
on the ground is the .most for
any Panther in history after ﬁve
games. » .

Panthers defeat Syracuse in
double overtime

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

On an otherwise miserable night,
the Pitt men’s soccer team pulled
out a theatrical 2-1 double—over—

time win over the Syracuse Or- '

ange Saturday on Pitt’s upper
campus.

Senior Ryan'Brode scored the
game winner with ﬁve minutes
remaining in the second over-
time to cap a come-from-behind

victory in frigid temperatures .
at Ambrose Urbanic Field. The
temperature at kickoff was 46::
degrees, and wind gusts reached‘

25 miles per hour.

I Brode redirected sophomore
Ryan McKenzie’s entry ball past
Syracuse goalkeeper Phil Boerger
in the 105th minute to ‘give the
Panthers (3-6-1, 1-1-0 Big East)
their first conference win in dra-

matic fashion.
“Ryan McKenzie delivered a
beautiful ball and he pretty much

put it right on my head,” Brode

said after the game. “I just tried
to redirect it into the goal. It
worked out.”

The goal was his ﬁrst of the
season, as was McKenzie’s as-
sist.

“Tonight was a big win,” head
coachjoe Luxbacher said after the
game. “We get three points. It’s
a Big East game. Guys get some
confidence. We needed it.”

Neither Pitt nor Syracuse (2-

-7—0,f0-2-0 Big East) could mount
1. ‘much offense*in the first half,
when-the wind was its strongest.

Theorange had three shots on
goal to the Panthers’ zero, but
none of those shots were dan-
gerous.

“When you‘ ﬁrst come out, the .
weather is a factor,” Pitt fresh-

man forward Chukwudi “Chu
Chu” Onyeukwu said after the
game. “But after you get going‘:

b you get your feet warm and you -
get your body warm, you put it -

behind you and play.”

Pitt out—cornered the Orange
10-7 on the night, but Syracuse
out-shot the Panthers 14-13. 4.

The Panthers’ best first-half
chance came in the 27th minute
when freshman defender Matt
Walbert let-off a long shot that
caught Boerger off—guard. The
ball rolled past the diving keeper;
and just missed the left post. '2:

Nick Roydhouse, who leads
Syracuse with six points this
season, had three shots in the
ﬁrst half. His last one, in the fi-
nal minute before intermission,
came from inside the box but»

FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND-
PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their edu-
cation records: These rights include: . . V '

- The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives
a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other

F

cial will make-arrangements for access and notify the students of the time and place where the records may bein-

up spected. if the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, thatoffi-I - >-

cial shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request shouldbe addressed.

- The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate.
Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is in a curate. They should write the Univer-
sity oliicial responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it
is inaccurate.

if the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student
of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Addi-
tional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notiﬁed of the right to a
hearing and is available at UP Policy and Procedure 09-08-01. ' I

- The right to consent to disclosures of personally identiﬁable information contained in the students

education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which
permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school
official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support
staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the Uni-

‘ ' tr versity has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trust-

ees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting an-
other school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the offi-
cial needs to review an education record in order to fulﬁll his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the
University will disclose education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or
intends to enroll. The University will fonivard records on request of another school. -

In one impressive play one third’ down
and 7 in the second quarter against South
Florida, Graham spun off three defenders
and dragged another to the ﬁrst—down
marker. On a third down earlier that quar-

' ter, he made a one-handed catch as he .

pulled in a ball thrown behind him.
Led by Graham, Pitt’s offense didn’t
punt until the third quarter against South

1 Florida, pinning the Bulls defense on the

fieldand wearing it out with a lethal com-
bination of quick snaps and downhill run-
ning. ~

“It seemed like every time we got them
in somewhat of a manageable defensive
situation, a long-yardage situation, they

guard for injured Nix

would make a play,” South Florida head
coach Skip Holtz said after thegame.

Holtz said his defense, lothiinithe n_a.-.
tion in .points allowed per game before
Thursday, cou1dn’t contain Graham, who
is bothpowerful inside the tackles and
explosive on the edge. I

“If he can get on the perimeter, he is
going to hurt you,” Holtz said. “They do
a great job getting their running backs
space, and once he got space he _would
make you miss.”—

The Panthers tore apart the,»South Flor-
ida defense without guard Chris Jacobson,
who is out for the season with a left-knee
injury. In addition, guard Lucas Nix left
in the first quarter of Thursday’s game
with a knee injury, although an MRI Friday
showed no major damage. '

Redshirt sophomore Ryan Schlieper,
on the third team two weeks ago, played
in Nix’s place. Schlieper’s pull blockin the
fourth quarter helped spring Graham for
a 31-yard gain that set up his second of

two touchdowns. I ‘

“Ray makes us look good,” Schlieper
said after the game. “When you’ve got ‘him,

they don’t really concentrate on the line-
'men. They kind of wait for Ray and they

don’t even see it happen.” 1

Onyeukwu said.

The goal was the first of Onyeukwu’s
college career.

Ryan Luffy (No. 4) and the Pitt men’s
soccer team picked up their ﬁrst Big East
‘ win on Saturday over Syracuse.

“We played a lot of freshmen tonight,”
Luxbacher said. “We had probably six or
seven freshmen out there most of the time.
It’s an evolving process. We’ve“been;mak:

ing mistakes that have been.killing.us~in‘

earlier games. Tonight we got solid play
throughout.”

Boerger had the save of regulation in

the 70th minute. Sophomore Nico Wrobel
snuck the ball through a pair of Orange
defenders to freshman Dan Prete, who

released a high, ‘hard shot heading for
the top left corner. But Boerger dove in

*desperation to tip the ball over the goal.

In the ﬁrst overtime,Johnston matched

rBoerger’s diving stop when Roydhouse

let a low strike go from just outside the
box. Johnston dove to his_right to snag
the shot.

“He not only dove to save it, but he
held the ball,” Luxbacher said. “If it would

Pitt nearly ended the game with sec-

found himself behind the Syracuse defense
to the left of the goal, and he rocketed a
shot off the left post. The rebound rico-
cheted to McKenzie, but his attempt was
blocked as time expired.

Brode made no mistake ﬁve minutes
later to snap Pitt’s two-game losing
streak. U

A ' _TheWalter Camp FootballFoundation named

'f~Pitt running back Ray Graham its National
Offensive Player of the Week after Graham
rushed for 226 yards against No. 16 South
Floridaon Thursday. _ _

. . Graham scored two touchdowns and
averaged 8.7 yards on his 26 carries against
the Bulls. He also ended the game with four

A receptions for 42 yards.

“Graham is quicker than he is fast and
he is very elusive,”- South Florida head
coach Skip Holtz said after the game on
Thursday. “He has sideways, lateral move-
ment. He has great vision and he can turn
and ‘go. If he can get on the perimeter, he
is going to hurt you.” ’ . .

The junior leads the nation with 734
yards so far this season. South Carolina’s
Marcus Lattimore is second with 677
yards. V

Graham’s 734-yard total also theil‘arg-

’ est achieved by a Pitt player through five
games in school history. Former Pitt run-
ning back and Heisman Trophy winner
Tony Dorsett previously held the record,
rushing for 717 yards through five games
in 1973. 4 f '

Graham leads the Big East and ranks
third nationally this season with 146.8
rushing yards per game. He’s'averaging 5.8
yards on his 126 carries this season.

Members of the media select the Walter

Camp National Players of the Week.
_ Pitt (3-2, 1-0 Big East) started offcon—
ference play with the upset over South
Florida at Heinz Field and will look to
