;  Have Not Died In Vain  

“To die for the truth is not to die merely for one’s faith,
at: one’s country; it is to die for the world.”

V William Cowper’s prophetic words, written during the
eighteenth century, ﬁnd striking application today. The grimy
hand of despotism has thrust another sword into the archives
of truth. "

The pages of history are full of ruthless tyrants who chal-
lenged the undeniable truth of the dignity of man. That
freedom has prevailed is no accident. The’ price‘ of vigilance
is costly but certainly worthwhile. Whether or not life is
worth living vitally depends on it.

The courageous Hun- 
garian rebels made it crystal 3
clear that this world will ‘
never succumb to tyranny.
The heartfelt thanks of free-
dom-lovers everywhere go out
to the brave men, women,
and children who sacriﬁced
their most precious possession
-—their lives—so that the spark
of freedom may burn eternal— ;
ly. These devotees of freedom ‘ ‘
have-maimed the ugly face of  I  "
Communism. .. . .1 . ls H‘

The stunning blow to Soviet imperialism must not be al-
lowed to pass through the bar of world opinion unnoticed.
Every voice raised in protest against Russian ruthlessness
serves to verify the heinous evils of Communism in prac-
tice. Every individual’s contribution _to assistance serves to
insure that Hungary will indeed overthrow the shackles of

  

  

“**~briite force and take her rightful place in the ﬁrmament of

freedom.

Yes, there is something we can do. We can put our full
support behind the mass meeting of students and -faculties
of the ﬁve Pittsburgh colleges, in addition to church, labor,
fraternal, and business organizations, who will meetat
Schenley High School Tuesday, Nov, 20, at 8:30 p.m. to
protest the actions of the Russians in Hungary.

Principal speaker will be a 21-year-old Hungarian student
who was studying forestry at the University of Sopron in
western Hungary when the revolution broke out. He led
students in disarming the secret police in Sopron and then
used their weapons to arrest all Communist functionaries in
the area. Shortly before escaping to Austria he was elected
~Mayor of Sopron by the Rebel Council. From Austriahe was
ﬂown to the United States to testify before the Senate Inter-
rial Security Sub-committee and give the American public. a
ﬁrst—hand report of events leading up to the rebellion.

Those who attended are assured of hearing an illuminat-
ing report straight from one who carried the banner of free-
dom. He and his countrymen have served us as surely as
they served Hungary, '

End Wal‘ton Given

All-American Honor

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Pitt’s great left end—Joe Walton—ﬁnally reaped the
harvest of four gruelling years of hard practice when Collieris
magazine, in conjunction with 503 football coaches across the

nation, named him as a- first team All-America selection on

the 1956 eleven.

The coaches, who comprise The American l‘Footba,l1

Coaches Association, based their¢

selections on actual ﬁeld observa-
tion, scouting reports and analyses
of game movies.

Walton, who hails from nearby
Beaver Falls, is the first bonaﬁde
All—America selection for the Pan-
thers since guard Bernie Barkous-
kie was acclaimed in 1949.

Joey Plays Both Ways

The Blue and Gold had two All-
America selections in 1952—tackle
Eldred Kramer and guard Joe
Schmidt——but they played during
the era of two-platoon football
when you had to b.e merely a
kicking specialist, or a kickoff re-
turn expert. to earn a letter.

In Walton, though, COL-

LIER’S has chosen an end who _

can go both ways. Joey usually
plays about 55 minutes a game
without suffering any apparent
effects on his playing effective-

JOE WALTON
Another Panther Great

O90

ness; all of which is attributed‘
to his durability and tip-top
physical condition.

Joey was an All-State fullback
while in high school. However,
whenhe came to Pitt, he was
switched to end at the beginning
of his sophomore year. He made
the transition in fine fashion and
has utilized his deceptive speed
and quick hands to make himself
the leading touchdown pass-
catching terminal in the country.

Opposing Mentors Praise Joey

Not only is the star Panther
wingman an oﬁensive threat, but
he ercels on defense as well with
his strong end play and jarring
tackles. Attesting to Joey’s All-
America recognition are Coach
Ben Schwartzwalder of Syracuse
and Coach Bill Murray of Duke.

Coach Schwartzwalder says
Joe is “Smart, resourceful and
powerful’ enough to go full 60
minutes at top" speed . . . great ‘-
hands  . caught every pass
that came within reach.”*

Coach Murray stated equivocal-
ly that Joe is “. . . unmatched at
smashing end runs.” The Beaver

Falls ﬂash undoubtedly prompted’

Murray tomake such a statement
from his great line play in foiling
Duke’s-‘end sweeps in this year’s
27-14 Panther triumph.

Michelosen Comments

Collier’s goes on to tell how
Walton and his mate at the other
end position —- R.C n K r a m er of
Michigan-—thriVe on rugged duty.
Walton (ﬁve eleven and 205.) is
also rated the standout in the
Panther line which is ranked the
strongest in the East and last

’week was ranked the eighth’ best

in the country.

“We use. a crashing defense,”
says Panther coach John Mich-”
elosen, “and our ends do most
of the crashing. Their job is to
bust up the interference, get
the ball carrier if possible.

“Naturally, they absorb plenty
of punishment,
really take it. In our tough battle
with Syracuse, for example, when
our line held Jimmy Brown to 52
yards. Walton played 54 minutes
and caught the TD pass whic
provided our 14-7 victory.” -

Greatest Performance
_J o e y ’ s greatest performance,
though, was against Minnesota.
Ironically, it came in a losing
cause. He grabbed an end-zone
pass to tie the score. Then, after

‘the Golden Gophers forged into

the lead on a. 26-yard ﬁeld goal,
Walton took’ the ensuing kickoff
and raced 77 yards for an appar-
ent last-minute victory only to
have the touchdown nulliﬁed by a
controversial clipping penalty.

The 63,500 fans» in Minn.esota’s
Memorial Stadium all talked about
Walton’s performance as they left
the game. it

Writers and announcers cov-
ering the game called Joe’s play
“one of the greatest perform-
ances in the 32-year-old history
of the Stadium.”

Curt Gowdy, the announcer who
broadcast the game for NBC,
stated, “That is one of the most
spectacular one—man shows I have
ever seen. Walton will get my
vote for All-American.”

This tale of glamour and suc-
cess has another twist, though.
Joe’s father, the late Frank “Tig-
er” Walton, who played in the
Rose Bowl and the East—West
Shrine‘ game, was a great Pan-
ther tackle in the early 930’s
Probably his greatest ambition
was to see Joe make it. He died
two days after Joe enrolled at
Pitt—knowing but not seeing.

Annual, Thanksgiving Wor-
ship service will be held in
Heinz Chapel Wednesday, Nov.
21, from 12:45 p.m. to 1:25 p.m.
Chaplain Luccock will speak on
the topic, “Hilariously Yours.”
A collection will be taken for
offerings to the World Univer-
sity Service through the Pitt
Chest.

Editor, The Pitt News:

While the local papers gave
the football team the favorable
report that it deserved in beat-
ing Notre Dame, they overlook-
ed a ﬁne performance by an-
other Pitt team -— the Demon-

at the’ Stadium. The precision
in the execution of the Disney
characters brought favorable
comment on our side of the ﬁeld
from Pitt and Irish rooters alike.

Please convey the commenda-
tions'of the alumni to Chairman
Sue Biddle and all students par-
ticipating in, the Block. With
their splendid teamwork‘ they
have added to our highly rated

Army Cadets Oblige

ls

By ED KoL'_r1'sKA

Over 55,600 Homecoming fans watched the Panthers come
from behind to trounce the Cadets of West Point, 20-7, at
the Stadium last Saturday afternoon.

After trailing 7-6 at halftime, the Oaklanders used a
combination of power and speed to score in each of the re-
maining quarters to notch their sixth victory against two

4' defeats.

Corny Salvaterra spearheaded the attack as he ran 14
yards for the ﬁrst touchdown; pitched out to Dick Bowen
for the second; and passed to Dick Scherer in the end—zone
for the third score. 

The Jungle Cats had a chance to use their power late
in the ﬁrst quarter. After an exchange of punts, quarterback

Dave Bourland marched the Cadets down to the Panther
three-yard line.

Here the Panther forward wall held for four downs
as Joe Walton, Bob Pollock, Vince Scorsone, Chuck
Brueckman, Dan Wisniewski, Herm .Canil, and Bob
Rosborough formed a solid line. i

Harriers Run Aftter IC4A Title

By MIKE GERBER ~

It took the Panther harriers
24 years to win their ﬁrst
IC4A cross-country champion-
ship, and from the nature of
things at the moment, it ap-

pears they will have to wait _

at least until next year to capture
their second title. . '

The meet will be run over the
Van Courtlandt Park ‘course in
New York beginning at 2:30 p.m.
this afternoon.

Along with the defending, sub-
par champion Panthers, such per-
ennial cross-country powerhouses
as Michigan State, Manhattan, St.
Johns, Syracuse, and Penn State
will also be entered.

Heavy favorites to capture the
teams title are the Spartans of
Michigan State University, who
also boast the individual favorite
in Henry Kennedy. Kennedy took
ﬁrst place in last year’s meet and
would now be in Melbourne,

‘M Australia, representing Canada in

the Olympics were it not for the
fact that he has not been a resi-
dent of Canada for the required
period of time.

Injuries Hamper Panthers
Although the Blue and Gold
beat a favored Michigan State
squad in last year’s IC4A compe-
tition, the injury-riddled Panth-

ers can hardly expect to upset the
dope again, for the Spartans have
acquired the all-important good
ﬁfth man which they lacked last
year.
The only team with any sig-
niﬁcant chancc of upsetting
Michigan State appears to be

Harford I

Smith

last year’s freshman meet and
have ﬁve or six very good sop-
homores.

Manhattan is another perennial-
ly strong outﬁt, but the Blackbirds
have had their ups and downs
this year, and don’t ﬁgure to chal-
lenge Michigan State.

Rees Optimistic

Syracuse and Penn State should
also provide some interesting
competition.

In talking about . the locals’
chances, Assistant Coach C a r l
Rees says that with a little good

St. Johns. The Redmen won t’

    

luck the Panthers could ﬁnish as
high as second. Rees also feels
that if his, team were in top phy-
sical condition there would even
be a chance for another ﬁrst
place ﬁnish.

However, injuries and food
poisoning have apparently nulli-
ﬁed the hope of another team
championship for the Blue and
Gold.

Veteran Moore Out

Jimmy Moore will not run at
all because of a groin injury, and
the rest of the team is still in a
weakened condition as a result of
the food poisoning episode, at
West Point.

Rees feels that Panther ace
Vinnie Timon would be able to
challenge Kennedy for indivi-
dual honors if he‘ were in top
shape, but the Panther star has
been slow to recover and still

feels weak after two weeks in
bed.

Making up the Panther aggre-
gation, along with Timon, will be
John Christof, Thornton Smith,
Dale Fauser, Wendell Harford,
Chuck James, and either Dick
Doyle or Sam Grisiotti.

Representing Skyscraper U. in
the freshman competition will be
Ron Rush and George Walters,
both of whom are given a good
chance, to ﬁnish near the top,
along with Dave Birchok, Ron
Goldstein, and John Smith.

Ride on State Win ‘

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Sports Editor

The Panther gridders won two-thirds of one struggle
and one-half of another crusade withtheir hard-earned 20-7
triumph over Army’s Cadets Saturday. After the game

Football is still in the full swing
of things, but the Panther cagers

house of- the ~ South — ‘North

Year in and year out the Wolf-
pack is one of the top teams in

out what his team has this year.

ago.
The game commentary will be

handled by Carroll (Beano) Cook. ’ A

Colonel Red Blaik said the Panthers were deﬁnitely the
monarch of Eastern football and should be ranked above

Syracuse and Penn State. In the voting for the Lambert
Trophy, emblematic of Eastern supremacy, the Jungle Cats are run-
ning a close second to one of their vanquished—Syracuse. .

If any team deserves to be rated above the Blue and Gold now,
*’it’s next week’s opponent Penn State for the obvious reason that the
two have not played; The Orange being ranked higher than the
baklanders seems absurd when you consider that we beat them, ‘
14-7, without permitting their offense to score a point. The only
way they tallied was on an interecepted pass which was run back
for a touchdown. I »

In lieu of having defeated all worthy chal- ' ' ~ '
lengers, the Panther-Lion contest at the Sta-
dium this weekend should decide the winner.
If the Panthers down the Nittany Lions and fail
to be voted the award for the second straight
year, the Lambert winner is a sham and ought
to be discontinued because of discriminating
pollsters. »

T The other battle, half won, is for a trip south
" on New Year’s Day. As is the case with the Eastern
championship, a trip south will hinge on the out-

come of the Penn State game. V

The two considerations are the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas,

and the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida. In order to get the

Cotton bid the locals will have to beat State and do it impressively.

Even if they sh’ould trounce the Lions, chances are still only fair

that they would be selected over Georgia Tech. 

An impressive victory, though, would greatly enhance, pos-
sibly assure, the chances of going to the Gator Bowl. Although
the Gator would be less ﬁnancially rewarding gate-wise, because
of a. limited seating capacity, it would still be lucrative because
of its natiori-wide television coverage. Since the gain is sched-
uled for Dec. 29 (two days before the other bowl games) it will
be unopposed for an audience on the coxial cable. Thus the

sponsors will pay twice as mucli for TV rights to the Gator as
they would for the oher bowls that will be competing with each
other for an audience; This would offset the smaller cut at the
gate. _
The best thing at the moment, though, is to forget the bowls and
concentrate on State. If the locals have received any feelers, they

are keeping it a secret. As Coach John Michelosen puts it, “We play
one gameat a time.” A

Whereas last week at this
time the Panther booters still
envisaged a winning season,

‘they now have one last hope
of splitting even for the season
of 1956. ‘

It will take more than hope,
however, to beat the Nittany Lions
of Penn State, last year’s Na-
tional co-champions, this Saturday
at 10 a.m. on Kennard Field. Al-
though the Panthers’ neighborly
enemies do not have as good a
record this year as last, they are
nevertheless a powerhouse bunch.

Penn State’s three losses have
all been by one point margins
to Penn and Rutgers, who are
both undefeated ,and Navy.

 Tom Nute, center forward, has
been the Lions’ most potent kick-
er. In that Army meet he scored
ﬁve goals, a Nittany record. Per
Torgeson, inside right, has been
the next most productive. The de-
