FOOTBALL

Defense  

leads Pitt to
victory over
Virginia

Sports Editor

In the week leading up to Pitt’s 14-3 victory
over Virginia, the masses grumbled about the
Panthers’ defense in their 58-55 triumph at
Duke the game before. To be fair, the defense

V allowed an unsightly number of points against

the Blue Devils, an amount that had some call-
ing for the job of defensive coordinator Matt

' House after only three games.

 For the next two weeks, the defense won’t
be a concern, as it ﬂipped the script from Pitt’s
shootoutwin at Duke last week to a dominant
defensive effort against the Cavaliers on Sat-
urday. Behind the efforts of the front seven
and defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Pitt held
Virginia to 188 yards of total offense.

“Last week we missed plays, and that is the
difference between last week and this week,”
Donald said. “Communication was real im-
portant, and everybody was making plays.
We got out there and did what we had to do.”

Because the defense did what was re-'

quired to meet the challenges presented by
Virginia’s offense, the Panthers (3-1, 2-1 ACC)

Dating apps like Grindr sex up smartphones

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬁ Wrz'ter

Joel Simkhai, the founder of a dating app
that caters to gay men, said that his prod-
uct is meant to solve one of his clients’
biggest problems: ﬁnding other gay men.
The app’s logo resemblesa black mask on
a bright yellow background.

“For the logo, we wanted something
that brought people back to a primal tribe

almost — like an African mask,” Simkhai
said in a statement. “It reminded us that
the desire to connect with other humans
is a basic primal need for all of us.”
Sirnkhai’s company, Grindr, has ac-

cumulated more than 6 million users in
192 countries since its launch in 2009, ' ‘
‘ more than 2 million of whom are in the

United States. Grindr is just one app that

allows users to look for romantic partners

through their smart phones. Tinder, a
similar app designed for men and women
lookingfor opposite— as well as same-sex
partners, connects users with potential
matches based on their proximity and
. whether both users “like” each other.
Simkhai said his company’s name was
inspired by the action of a coffee grinder

Fashion on wheels put a spin on the typi-

cal fashion boutique as it rolled into Oak-
land this weekend.

After receiving a call from Only in
Oakland, an organization designed to
stimulate business and cultural events
infthe‘ neighborhood, three business

owners parked their fashiontrucks one if
Oakldﬁd Avenue on Friday afternoon. *
They created their mobile shops, about -'
_ the size of a recreational vehicle, to sell V
merchandise for customers on the go.-
All‘;~thr§e mobile clothing stores started
last summer. " ~ S    

’ The owners all sell clothing and acces

'_ sories straight from the interior of their
trucks. Mobile clothing stores, known as,‘

“fashion on wheels,” imitate-the model of
increasingly popular food trucks to travel
around offering fashion. Originating in
California about four or ﬁve years ago,
fashion on wheels is beginning to appear
in more locations aroundethe country.

 ;walk whiletl1e‘rest of the merchandise

S remained inside the truck. Her target»
~ customers are women and girls on the go,

A f who are then able to walk into the truck

_. and explore the products. ‘ '

“It’s a new concept, soit’s like planting
the seed,” Ging said of her new business.

Ging’s Style Truck boa'sts her compa-
ny’s slogan‘, “Have Fashion, Will Travel.”
Similar to an old-fashioned ice cream
truck, the mobile shop is outlined with
purple stripes, and the business logo is
printed on theeside with a cartoon pur-
ple truck carrying the business name in
black, bold letters.

Ging, originally from the South Hills,
stumbled upon the idea while reading a

.magazine about-a year ago that featured

fashion trucks and founded her fashion
truck company this pastjuly. Since then,
she has beenbusy traveling to private
parties, corporate events, charities and

i locations around Pittsburgh, such as the.
Strip District and Bloomﬁeld.

Before she owned the truck, Ging
brought retail racks to locations such
as ]ergel’s, a restaurant in Cranberry
Township, and Treesdale, a residential
community in Gibsonia, Pa. Last Christ-
mas season, she gained more success and
knowledge of the business at the holiday

‘ market in Market Square, a public space
‘ that hosts vendors Downtown.

With a background in marketing and
advertising, she has worked with entre-
preneurs in the past and v-isiteda fashion

with the idea.

GB member, band member coronated for Homecoming

Em Maier
Assz'stamf News Editor

Amelia Brause didn’t know what to do
after she became Pitt’s reigning queen.
She didn’t know where to go, either.
“It was really hard to find anyone
afterwards,” she said. “We weren’t sure
where to go or what was supposed to
happen.” '

Nevertheless, the 45 texts she re-
ceived from her Alpha Delta Pi sorority
sisters expressed the excitement they
felt because she was crowned. A

At halftime of the Saturday football
game against the University of Virginia,
the Homecoming King and.Queen were
announced: Seniors Zach Greenﬁeld and

‘Amelia Brause.

Seniorjoe Kozak, a physics engineer-
ing major and president of the Blue 8:
Gold Society, thought the event “went
well for the most part.”

Brause, a neuroscience major from
Scotch Plains, N.]., had plenty of experi-

ence with Pitt’s campus and traditions.
She works on the Student Government
Board and serves as the undergradu-
ate representative for the Chancellor
Search Committee, whichenabled her
to meet and interact with a signiﬁcant
number of students throughout her
campaign.

“I was very surprised. I truly didn’t
think I’d win. I owe all of my success or
glory to those who helped me,” Brause
said, citing her sorority, Her Campus,
Colleges Against Cancer and Take Back
the Tap as a few of her supporters.

Greenfield, amember of Pitt Band,
could‘ not be reached for comment.

“The tradition of homecoming court

is part of school spirit and pride, Kozak

said. - . e

ferent facets, so this is another outlet

because the purpose is to bring people
together and mix them. i

He added that the need to connect
with others is a basic one, and he de-
signed Grindr to ﬁll that need.

Tinder users, who log in through
Facebook accounts, can access recom-
mended matches based on sex, age range
and distance from their current location,

which the app measures through their
smartphones. As the site gives them rec-
ommendations, they have the choice of
choosing to “like” or say “nope” to each
potential partner. .

The smartphone app digitizes users’
ﬁrst impressions into a single tagline,
which appears along with the picture of
the recommended user. A

For instance, one male user wrote,
“Who knows, we might go down in ﬂames,
but then again I might just change your
name,” to potential partners, quoting the

song “Could it Be" by Charlie Worsham.

“Can we lie about how we met?” an-
other man’s tagline asks.

After two Tinder users like each other,
a message box appears that enables them
to chat. Then, phrases such as "‘Cuddling
alone is no fun” and “You can tell your
kids you met on Tinder” pop up on the
screen, prodding users to engage each
other in conversation.

Meetings on dating apps such as Grin-
dr and Tinder are based on snap judge-
ments. But the interactions between us-

ers might not be as unlike face-to—face
interactions as they seem, according to
Christine Whelan, a sociology professor
at Pitt.

“On the one hand, you could say that
this is a bad thing, that the focus on ap-
pearance makes the interaction superﬁ-
cial and suggests a meat market kind of
sexual marketplace,” she said. “And yes,
to me it does sort of scream of meaning-
less hookup culture rather than the search
for an emotional relationship. But on the
other hand, isn’t thatkind of what you
do at a party?”

When a student is interested in some-
one at a party, he or she might see the
other person from across the room.

In this case, the student only knows
about as much as one can glean from a
Tinder tagline or possibly less, but makes

the decision to go over and talk to the

person anyway.

Tinder could not be reached for com-
ment despite multiple requests over sev-
eral weeks.

While dating apps are growing in pop-
ularity, some critics have said that online
dating and smartphone apps have fueled
“hookup culture,” or widespread casual
sex among college-aged men and women.

But Whelan said that the phenomenon
of casual sex predates smartphones and
dating apps. She also said casual sex
might not be quite as common as many
believe it is. In her conversations with
students, she found that most of them
hook up in the hopes, however slim, of
ﬁnding a relationship.

“I really think that we have this idea
that everybody is hooking up and every-
body is having lots of drunken sex, and
that’s just not true,” Whelan said.

Although Whelan disputed how many

students are actually seeking casual sex, --

the leader of a campus advocacy group
said that women are more willing to en-
gage in no—strings—attached, sex.

“I think that that is as relatively new
concept, though obviously women have
had those feelings for a while  Recent-
ly, it’s become much’ more common for
people to accept that women are sexual
beings,” Erin Case, the president of Cam-
pus Women’s Organization at Pitt, said.

comes, they’ll be able to say, ‘Oh, that’s
the King and the Queen? and realize that
they have a lot of spirit and embody
what Pitt represents. It’s just another
way forpeople to get out there and rep-
resent the University in another way,”
Kozak said.

support of friends, she has been running
her business on her own. ”

Another boutique on wheels, known
as Broke Little Rich Girl, offers women’s
clothing and accessories from New York,_
California and locally made labels. The
truck was parked right on the curb with
the back door open, allowing customers

' to walk into the boutique with the help

of a few steps. _

“Some of the pieces’ you can’t ﬁnd any-
where else,” Sam Lugo, the owner for this
truck, said. _

Lugo’s truck was decorated with pink

stripesthat crisscrossed on each side of S —

the truck and featured her logo, which

includes the name of the business in black

cursive against a pink background. I
The inside of the truck, which formerly

- hosted bread, resembles a retail store with

clothing hanging on racks, jewelry, purses
and belts displayed on decorative chests.
It even contains a dressing room located
inside. Lugo puts small vases of ﬂowers
around to decorate the atmosphere.

L Lugo began her business in aboutjuly
as well. She continues to work part time
at a ﬁnancial institution, although she
said she would not give details about the
institution because of conﬁdentiality is-
sues. She ﬁrst got the idea for Broke Little
Rich Girl when she spotted a fashion truck
in Chelsea, N.Y. She thought about opening
up ‘a boutique, but soon realized that she
didn’t want to have a store that waited for
the customers. She wanted to be the one
going to them.

Affordable Care  makes signing up
for health coverage easy for students

Natalie Russell
Columnist

The government will officially
instate the Affordable Care Act on
Oct. 1, making health care available
for the 19 million Americans be-
tween the ages of 18 and 34, who
currently don’t have coverage. I’m
one of them.

' Most college students are cur-
rently covered under their parents’
plans, which is a direct result of the
Affordable Care Act. Plans and issu—
ers are now required to offer depen-
dent coverage to children until they

reach the age of 26. Still, everything
from parental unemployment to
independent status canleave some
students in the dust. But for young
students who don’t have much ex-
perience orchestrating their own
health care coverage, the act also
makes signing up for coverage fea-
sible. _

At Hea1thcare.gov, students can
ﬁll outashort form that asks for age,
gender, location and other relevant
information. With these results, the
program generates a list of options
for which the individual is likely

eligible. With a user—friendly, side-
by—side chart, students can easily
compare and contrast the coverage
plans available, while also exploring
opportunities such as tax credits to
lower costs. _

By January 2014, 17 million of
the 19 million uninsured young
adults could also be eligible forfree
or reduced coverage plans through
expanded Medicaid programs. Un-
fortunately, Pennsylvania is one of
the 27 states that won’t participate

in the expansion, though Gov."Tom Corbett
recently said he’ll accept federal subsidies
from the act in order to expand Medicaid.
Under Corbett’s proposed expansion, Med-
icaid recipients would pay modest monthly
premiums instead of co-payments for doc-

Althoughthe health care industry is mov-

ing in the right direcltion, there are still some

things that Pitt students in particular can do
to speed along the process of Pennsylvania’s
alternative expansion model. In addition to
getting involved with organizations such as
Young Invincibles, you can play a more ac-
tive political role by contacting Pennsylvania
congressmen to urge the movement toward
expanding health care.

For someone like me, this plan means
being able to see a doctor for the ﬁrst time
in years. But for someone who is still unin-
terested in becoming insured, the penalty
fee for opting out of the Affordable Care Act
starts at $95. I

Panthers enter
ACC with pair
of Victories L
  over the
  Weekend

Mark Powell
Staﬁ’ I/Vriter

Pitt women’s. volleyball left ‘little doubt
that it belongs in the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference this weekend, as the Panthers
beat both Clemson and Georgia Tech
without dropping a set. '

The Panthers’ perfect weekend was
due largely in part to their offensive ex-
ecution. Pitt had more than a .300 hit
percentage in both games.

“We took care of our side of the net,”
head coach Dan Fisher said.

The Panthers began ACC play against
Clemson on Friday night at Fitzgerald
Field House.

The ﬁrst set started slowly for Pitt,
as the Panthers went down 14-13. Clem-
son’s lead was short—lived, however, as
the Panthers went on to take seven of
the next eight points and win the set in
convincing fashion.

The second set was more of the same
for the Panthers. Pitt enjoyed a 7-0 run
and was able to pull away fairly early in
the set behind juniors Jessica Wynn and

-Lindsey Zitzke.

The Tigers put up more of a ﬁght in the
third set and proved that they would not
go down easily. Pitt’s defense was lack-
ing, and the team was unable to produce
the blocks necessary to take control of
the set.

Clemson was able to notch several
kills and keep the match tied on several
occasions. Still, the Panthers were able to
take control and win the third set behind

Coming off a game in which quarterback
Tom Savage threw for record—setting
numbers, the fifth-year senior was
forced to leave Sunday’s game early
with concussion—like symptoms.

During the final play of the third
quarter, Savage scrambled while trying
to escape Virginia pass rushers. See-
ing Virginia defensive end Max Valles
ahead, Savage elected to take a feet-first
slide, avoiding a hit with Valles.

However, Valles speared Savage
above theshoulders, causing both hel-
mets to collide.

Chryst believes the hit on Savage was

their bye week on a tl1ree—game winning
streak. The three—game run marks the ﬁrst
time since 2009 that Pitt has won three
straight and also broke the streak of win two,
lose two that has prevailed since head coach
Paul Chryst took the helm last season.

“Our defense played really well,” Chryst
said. “They brought a lot of energy.”

Between weeks, the adjustments that led
the defense to play with more energy than it
did against Duke weren’t so much technical as
simple, and they were those that Chryst made
sure to get across to his defense.

“He was just telling us what we had to do,”
Donald said. “He toldus communication was
important on making plays, We went out there
and tried to show that.”

’ Communications impact was on full dis-
play in the fourth quarter when the Cavaliers
were threatening to score from Pitt’s 3-yard
line with just under ﬁve minutes left in the

 

 game. Down by 11 points, atouchdown would

have rendered the contesta one-possession

game and made the atmosphere at Heinz
Field tense.

_ On back-to—back plays, Virginia quarter-
back David Watford looked for tight endjake
McGee. But Anthony Gonzalez ﬂattened Mc-
Gee after he caught a swing pass in the ﬂat,

and defended an attempt to McGee in the '

back of the end zone, which forced aturnover
on downs.

After the success Duke had against Pitt, the
stop wasn’t just critical to the proceedings of
Saturday’s game, but also served as a moral
victory for the Pitt defense. A

“It was really important at the end,” Don-
ald said. “It was a big fourth down stop.”

Gonzalez led Pitt with 10 total tackles Sat-
urday from his spotasvan outside linebacker.

“There were a lot of good performances
on defense, but mostly I felt everyone was
doing their job,” Chryst said. “The players
were cutting loose, and that was good to see.”

Donald was one player who made an im-

. pact, as he penetrated the Virginia backﬁeld .

on seemingly every snap. Donald ﬁnished
three tackles, including two sacks.

kills from Wynn and junior Kate Yeazel.
After a convincing win Friday night,

 

the Panthers looked to continue their
success against Georgia Tech on Sunday,

The ﬁrst set was back-and-forth early
on. Both the Panthers and the Yellow
jackets traded runs until the later portion
of the first set. 3

Neither team ever had complete con—
trol of the set, but the Panthers were able
to win 26-24 after a crucial last point.

The Jackets were off to a good start
in the second set, as they took an early
12-9 lead. After a timeout, the Panthers
responded by going on a 6-3 run to tie

~ the set at 15.

Yeazel was dominant, and she and the
Panthers were able to take control and
win the set 25-21.

The third set was dominated by the
Panthers. The jackets were never able to
respond to Pitt’s dominant offensive play
as the Panthers recorded a .333 hitting
percentage in the set, enough to carry

~

them to a 25-14 victory. -
Pitt took a big step toward proving
itself as a ACC contender this season.

While it is still earlyin the season, the '

team has played with a quiet confidence
its last few matches, which will most
likely continue.

“We hit at a very high percentage,”
said Yeazel. “We’Ve learned how to
bounce back after messing up on a few
points.” ‘ h 2 _

With the wins, Pitt improved to 10-5
overall and 2-0 in league play. For a team
chosen to ﬁnish second to last in the
preseason ACC poll, this start is a posi-
tive one.

“We use the rankings as motivation,”
said Wynn. “We know we’re better than
that.”

Even with the wins, the Panthers still
feel they have room to improve as Geor-
gia Tech and Clemson each scored into
the twenties in multiple sets. Defensive
work could go a long way toward meeting
the requirements to improve.

“These games were much closer than
they needed to be,” said Wynn. %

reason behind his poor performance.

“I saw a lot of triple teams and dou-
ble teams._.I think [Virginia’s defense]
schemed well. They pretty much locked
the up. Their defensive, line did a tre-
mendous job too.” '

“We knew that could’ve happened,”
Street said of Virginia’s coverage. “We
prepared for it, and it did happen. I’m
just so proud because it’s really showing
how much of a team.we are. We still have
a lot ofwork to do,_but it’s good to see
that we still play the game as a team.”

Boyd led all receivers with seven
catches for 111 yards in a week when
the Panthers were very quiet on the of-
fensive front. Boyd’s receiving day made
him the second freshman in program
history to record three consecutive
100-yard receiving games.

“Everyone was getting down about
themselves, but linking back together
and pushing ourselves down the field
is what changed this game,” Boyd said.

DEFENSE

Donald’s fellow defensive tackle iii Pitt’s
starting lineup, Tyrone Ezell, added three
tackles of his own. While no one’s numbers
were gaudy, Pitt’s defense executed its assign-
ments on virtually every play to limit Virginia
to gaining just 2.7 yards per play.

. _“We all just did our jobs, and we did them

well. That was the same saying for the whole '

week,” Ezell said. “Wemacle sure all of our
eyes were on our keys, and we did that well.”
Next to Gonzalez at linebacker, true fresh-
man Matt Galambos stepped into the starting
role at middle linebacker after Shane Gordon
was unavailable because of an unspeciﬁed
injury. The opportunity for Galambos was
another granted to a freshman this season,
and he was ready for it. E i
“As soon as Shane went down, I ﬁgured I
was the next man up,” Galambos said. .“Coach
‘ told me that ‘this is your job,’ and thatlslaoiild

V. be ready to play.”
Galambos recorded four tackles and an- .

chored a defense that prevented its opposition
from striking for any big plays like Duke 
able to do.

“We came in with a different mentality
this week and tried to be more of a unity and
down on big plays,” Galambos said. “I thought
we leveraged the ballet lot today, gang tackled
and played really relentless.” '

_ The end result was a suffocating 14-3 vic-
tory, ledby the defense, to bring a lot of good
feelings into the Panthers’ byeweek.

“Itfelt great to go three in a row,” Ezell said.
“It’s something we haven’t done in a while here
at Pitt, and it feels great right now.” E

were there to watch it,” Conner said.

Conner completed the game with
just 35 yards rushing on 15 carries, but
Chryst elected to use three running
backs in the game, one of the many
contributing factors in the Panthers’
victory.

One of the backs was freshman Ra-

late in the fourth quarter, had his name
