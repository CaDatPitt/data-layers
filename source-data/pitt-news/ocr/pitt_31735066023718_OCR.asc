Women's Center to Search for External Funding

By SCOT STONE

Pitt News Staff Writer

Despite the announcement by the
provost’s office that Pitt’s
Women’s Center will not be funded
by the University after June
30,1981 , the Center is currently sear-
ching for external funds,.according
to Cynthia Vanda, the director of
the center.

“People have called and told us
they're outraged,” Vanda said.
“They have asked us what they can
do to help; a lot of people have told

‘ us they’ve written letters to the

university, or a legislator.”

Several people have suggested
that the center could easily raise a
dollar from each female student on
campus and make its budget.

“I think that’s a great idea,”
Vanda commented, “but we don’t
have the time to do that every year,
and in order to raise my salary I
don’t think that is appropriate.”

Instead, the center is focusing on
securing available grants and dona-
tions from foundations and govern-
ment agencies, she said.

Don't get caught drlning at the football game...or

else! .

This past Wednesday, The Pitt
News reported the problems that
the residents of , the 12th floor in
Tower A were having with cock-
roaches. The residents were
disconcerted by the lack of response
from university officials. Several
maintenance slips were allegedly fil-
ed‘ by the residents, with a claim
that no action was taken by

— housekeeping.

On Wednesday, the housekeep-
ing supervisor for the Towers, Betty
Duffet, returned and the record
book was opened. The records
verify that only one slip was actual-

“We’ve been developing pro-
posals to go to external funding
sources, but when you go for funds
you go for what's offered in your
geographical area,”Vanda said.
“But since Pitt has a major capital
campaign underway we can't go to
local corporations and
foundations.” .

“The people that fund in Pitt-
sburgh are corporations so this
campaign really ties our hands,”she
added. ,

There will be a meeting at 4-D.m.
on October 13 at the Women’s

Center, called by women on the
faculty, for anyone who wants to
come and address the problem.

The decision to cut funding for
the center is based on the budget
crunch that has been predicted by
the provost’s office for 1982.

“The issue is that by fiscal year
1982, we will have to make signifi-
cant funding decisions,” Assistant
Provost Dr. Ray Steele said. “We
had to set priorities, and those areas
not central to our academic mission
had to be cut back.”

ly submitted. The slip was dated
September 15, 1980. The exter-
mination occurred ten days after
that, on September 25.

“It isn’t feasible to call them (ex-
terminators) out every time a slip is
submitted,” Duffet said. Because
only one slip was filed, Duffet said,
it was not considered an emergency.
The extermination took place on
the scheduled date set up between
the university and the exter-
minators.

Duffet was present during the ex-
termination that occurred on the
25th and also during the scheduled
extermination two weeks before.
Several residents claimed that the

As of this week the situation
hasn’t changed from the point of
view of the provost’s office.

“I don’t have an answer that is
different from the one I gave Cyn-
thia in July,” Steele said, “I do
know that she has attended a fund
raising seminar, which I encouraged
her to attend, but that is simply a
way of our saying we’re trying to
help you help yourself.

“We’re sorry this has become a
necessity,” Steele added, “but in a
tight budget that must provide for
over a hundred departments, it is
difficult to find full funding for this
kind of thing.”

I If the center ‘is unable to continue
its operations, several services will
be eliminated that are not available

- elsewhere, such as the center’s mon-

thly newsletter, Synthesis and the
counseling program.

“While an individual may go and
get counseling in other places,”
Vanda said, “there are no other
places that provide the services that
we do on the changing roles of
women and men, and this seems to

Rowdy Behavior at Football Games    
Causes stricter Alcohol Policy

 By SCOTT SELTZ"
Pill News Staff Writer I
Due to increased complaints of
drunk and rowdy behavior at recent
Pitt football games, the Athletic

department, in conjunction with .

the Stadium Authority, has adopted
a revised alcohol policy that will be
stringently enforced starting with
Saturday’s game.

“We have received more com-
-plaints from spectators than usual
and we needed to clarify the univer-
sity’s position,” according to Den-
nis Donham, assistant vice
chancellor for student affairs.

“Basically, this is just a reafﬁrmat '

tion, of the old alcohol policy that
has always covered the stadium.”
The revised policy allows atten-

dants at the entrance gates to in-

spect packages for alcoholic
beverages and refuse admission to
anyone found to be in possession of
alcohol, Donham said. Similar
complaints have been filed during
past years but as-Jim Thomas, assis-
tant business manager for the

earlier extermination did not hap-
pen. .

Hal Lavin, supervisor of en-
viromnental services, said that it is
customary for Duffet to accompany
the exterminators.

“The spraying sometimes lasts
less than half an hour. It's possible
that the residents just missed him,”
Lavin said in response to the
residents’ disbelief.

All of _ the maintenance slips that
are filed by residents are done so at
the Towers desk.

“The students fill them out there
and give them to the desk person
who time-stamps them and puts
them into the maintenance box,”

be very important in terms of the ef-
fectiveness of the services women
get.” .

“We get a lot of women retum-
ing to school, young mothers and
older women,” said work study in-
tern Rhonda Burt. “It’s a hard
thing, going back to school, and
they need someone to talk to, to
reassure,and to help them adjust.”

Synthesis, a visible feature of the
Women’s Center, is also threatened
by thefunding cut. The newsletter
includes event notices, articles by
the director of the center and
others, and pieces from other
publications on a variety of feminist
issues. '

“We have all of this information
in, one place,” said Shirley
Schulman, administrative assistant
at the center. “People looking for
one thing can find out about many
other things they might not know
about through us.” .

According to Vanda the center

serves a wide constituency, both  ’

locally and within the university.
“We wanted to be responsible to

Athletic department stated, “the
c‘ornplaints"seem to have increased
at --the beginning of this season

-which has made it necessary to en-

force this new policy. ’ ’

“I don’t feel that the policy is be-
ing enforced to discriminate against
students who attend the games, but
I think‘ that by reestablishing this
policy, everyone attending the
games . can benefit,” added
Donham.

Although stadium security can-
not legally search a person, they do
have the right to inspect packages
with consent of the owner. Admis-
sion can be denied to anyone who
will not comply with the policy. If
alcohol should pass the entrance
gates it will be confiscated on sight
by the security officers.

“We don’t want to cause grief
for anyone, including the students.
The Athletic department is iust try-
ing to present Pitt football for the
enjoyment of everyone without any
hassles,” Thomas said.

With this approach in mind the

women in the community,” Vanda
said. “The issues of discrimination,
of sexism, all the ‘issues of the
women’s movement affect women
everywhere. ’ ’

“People come here because they
feel comfortable and safe,”
Schulman added. “A lot of people
feel that with the center they have a
place to come to, a place that
receives them and makes them feel
good.”

   

Cyhia nda

Athletic department has offered
two alternative options for alcohol

totingspectators. If a spectator is .

apprehended with alcohol before
entering the stadium, he will be ask-
ed to return it to his car. If he
refuses, the alcohol can be
deposited at the gate where the
owner will receive a receipt. All of
the alcohol collected during the
games will be stored in the Forbes
Field House where the owner can
claim his property on the following
Monday.

“I don’t think that one group can
be singled out as the cause of this
behavior; it would be impossible to
unfair to make such an assumption.
The policy does not pertain to just
one group but is being enforced
equally for all spectators,” assured
Donham. -

Pittsburgh City Police and
Pinkerton Security guards will be
enforcing the policy at all entrance
gates to the stadium at tomorrow’s
game against Maryland, Donham
added;

said Kathleen Connolly, desk super-

doesn’t even look at them.”

The slips are removed daily, so
the other three slips the residents
claimed to have filed were not
displaced by the desk. '

The residents also reported that
their housekeeping was not up to
standard. On September 26, Duffet
was on the 12th floor to investigate
a complaint about the quality of the
housekeeping. Duffet said she was
“satisﬁed that the area was clean.”
The floorwas found to be no dif-

Irish Political Prisoners to Begin Hunger Strike 

By CLARE GLEASON
Pitt News Staff Writer
' The political prisoners held in
Northern Ireland’s British-run
prisons are expected to begin a
hunger strike in protest of

» deplorable conditions and treat-

ment received in these prisons,
within the next few months, accor-
ding to Fra McCann, a former
political prisioner.

McCann. who served six and a
half years in a British-run prison
was touring the United States to in-
form the American people of the

atrocities committed by the British. ‘

He hoped to gain U.S. support of
the prisioners to limit the duration
of the strike.

Boston city ‘ council and the
Massachussetts House of Represen-
tatives for “His heroic stand in suf-
fering over three years of torture

BAS Expresses

By DIANE R. POWELL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Members of Pitt’s_ Black Action
Society joined approximately
50,000 black students, administra-
tors and support groups in the
Black College Day march and rally
held recently in Washington, D.C.
Many participants traveled over 20
hours from as far as New Orleans to
express their support for the sur-
vival of the 107 black colleges in this
country.

Participants assembled at the
Eclipse next to the White House
where a two-hour rally was held.
Black college bands performed bet-
ween speeches given by black col-

into the U.S. by the immigration
board in New York city. He is
presently being held inra Detention
Home without bail.

McCann was refused a visa by the
U.S.

Jonathan Davidson, British em-
bassy press ofﬁcer, has accused Mc-
Cann of being an Irish Republican
Army (IRA) terrorist whose motive

in the U.S. is to raise support of ter-.

rorist activities.

The British government has also
asked that Massachussetts ‘write a
formal apology to parliment for
giving honors to an Irish terrorist.

McCann made a brief plea for his
cause in an Irish History class in
David , Lawrence Hall September
29. He. produced correspondence
from prisoners and chaplains and
spoke of his own experiences in
Belfast’s Long Kesh Prison.

McCann estimates 370 men and,
30 women are presently being de-
tained for political crimes and
200-300 people are awaiting
sentences. Presently many are
engaged in a blanket protest. They
refuse to wear prison uniforms

because they deny that they are
criminals so they hide their
nakedness with blankets from the
cells. «

McCann describes his experiences
in Long Kesh from arrest to con-
finement.

“In Northern Ireland a person

accused of a political crime is taken A

to an interrogation center. ,They
may be kept here for any amount of
time without access to lawyers.
They undergo lengthy interroga-
tions during which they are beaten
by police officers,” McCann said.
“What one has to remember is
that over 90 percent of the prisoners
are interned because of confessions
they are forced to make upon
themselves extracted at these inter-
rogation centers,” he continued.
“Political prisoners are tried in
Diplock Court without a jury, I was
forced to make statements against
myself after five days of beatings

A and charged with membership in

the IRA which is not true.
“We call this judicial process the
conveyor belt of torture. Men are

arrested under special laws for

support for Black Colleges

lege administrators and students.

After the rally, supporters mar-
ched down Pennsylvania Avenue
carrying signs, placards, banners,
balloons and chanting “save black
colleges.” Upon reaching the
Capitol lawn, another rally was held
featuring speeches by Dick
Gregory, Tony Brown and
presidential surrogates.

Ramona Riscoe, chairperson of
Pitt’s Black Action Society, said she
felt the march and rally was very
successful and achieved its goal.

“It was a very positive and
powerful message. In a time where
black students are ' labeled as
apathetic it felt good to see a large

turnout of predominantly 18-23

"year-old black ‘people. For the

_ politically conscious it 'epresented

the potential of this voting age
group to politicians seeking black
support,” Riscoe said.

“They let the administration of
this country know that the total in-
tegration of black colleges in
America will not take place without
a national struggle,” Riscoe added.

-The Black College Day march
and rally was coordinated by Tony
Brown, through The Project 80
Coalition for Black Colleges in
response to the desegregation plans
which could possibly eliminate
predominantly black colleges in this
country. .

criminals of a political nature and
held without bail,” he said.

McCann cited atrocities to
women as well as men.

“Women under protest were at-

tacked and beaten by wardens and
denied toilet facilities and washing
facilities. They were allowed out for
one hour a day during which time
facilities were closed and they were
refused access after requests were
made. During this time they were
denied medical attention and one
women with anorexia weighed less
than eighty pounds and had to be
fed by intravenus,” McCann said.
“If women went to mass they

were subject to internal searches _

daily, in the presence of male
wardens.”

“Father Morey,. a prison
chaplain, was shocked by the
beatings the women in Long Kesh
had received at the hands of male
warders,” he said.

McCann went to New York to
stage a demonstration at Lincoln
Center where Prince Philip was due
to speak concerning cruelity to
animals. McCann wanted to ask if

Irish Prisoner of War Commit-

CAS Alumni Favor Language, Math

Other Changes In Course Curriculum

By JOHN STEWART

The Committee on Curriculum
reform for the College of Arts and
Sciences recently sent out a
questionaire to 700' CAS alumni
asking for their reaction to possible
curriculum changes.

Of the 202 who responded, many
were in favor of the various
changes in the curriculum that are
eventually to be made.

The following is a list of
propositions that were contained in
the questionaire. (The percentage
listed beside each proposition
shows how many of those who
responded either agreed or strong-
ly agreed to that proposition.)

-As part of their general
education, all students in the
College of Arts and Sciences should_
be required to demonstrate proﬁ-
ciency in a foreign language. (48
percent)

-All students in the College
should be required to demonstrate
at least elementary proﬁciency in
some ﬁeld of quantitative reason-
ing (mathematics, statistics, com-

.puter science, symbolic logic, etc.)

(91 percent)

-All students should be required
to take some courses in which a
serious emphasis is-placed on good
writing (these would be courses
beyond basic composition courses,
and might be in history, literature,
or any other department). (93
percent)

-All students should be required
to take at least one course in which
major works of literature are read
and analyzed. (68 percent)

-All students should be required
to take one course on classical
music or ﬁne arts. (52 percent)

-All students should be required
to take at least one course in
history. (70 percent)

--All students should be required
to take atleast one course dealing
with the analysis of a signiﬁcant
public issue or issues. (80 percent)

-All students should be required
to take courses that introduce them
to the major ideas and methods of
contemporary biological and phys-
ical science. (70 percent)

-All students should be required
to take one or more courses that

introduce them to a foreign culture
or cultures. (66 percent)

-All students should be‘ required
to take at least one course on the
main concepts and procedures of

modern social science. (70 percent)

According to Irwin Schulman,
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, a ﬁnal draft of the
proposed changes will be presen-
ted to the full CAS faculty for ﬁnal

approval. Schulman said it may

take a year to incorporate all the
changes into the curriculum.
Schulman also said that currently
enrolled CAS students who are
graduating soon will not be
affected by the new changes. He
said ‘they would follow the past
requirements.

two years of graduate study, with
the exception of the Harry ‘S.
Truman Scholarship, which covers
the last two years of undergraduate
study as well as the ﬁrst two years
of graduate study.

Robert Pape, a Pitt ‘ junior major-
ing in Political Science and now
studying for his M.A. at the
Graduate School of Public and In-
ternational Affairs, won the
Truman Scholarship for the state of
Pennsylvania.

The Truman Scholarship is the
Congressional memorial to the late
President and is awarded. to

sophomores interested in govern-
ment or public service careers.
“You have to show that you have
made ﬁrm preparations toward
your career goal. The award is
nothing anyone should count on
and you shouldn’t think that you’ve

, won it on what you’ve done in the

past. It’s not what you’ve done but
what you’re going to do,” accor-
ding to Pape.

Other scholarships that ,are
available include the Rhodes, which
chooses 32 students from the
United States every year for
graduate study at Oxford and the
Marshall for the graduate study of

any subject leading to the award of
a British university degree.

There is one scholarship which is
open only to women, the Alice
Freeman Palmer Fellowship. One
fellowship each year is awarded to a
woman graduate of an American
institution for study or research in
any field in the United States or
abroad.

A law school scholarship is also
available through the Root-Tilden
Program at the New York Univer-
sity School of Law. It covers tuition
for one year and is renewable if the
student maintains satisfactory per-

LAC Offers A

By VALERIE JACHIMOWICZ

The Legal Awareness Committee
of the Student Government Board
provides legal information, on a
variety of problems, to University
students, faculty, and staff, accor-
ding to Public Relations chairman
DaveVMinesky.

The LAC is composed of approx-

. imately 30 undergraduate students.

The committee is chaired by Dave
Crissman; Scott Riback is co-
chairperson, and Laura Betts is
secretary. The committee is look-
ing for a treasurer at this time. Dave
Minesky chairs the public relations
subcommittee, and Joe Flecken-

' ‘stein is the chairperson of .the

judicial board subcommittee. New
administrators will be elected by the
members at the end of this term. _

To qualify for membership, in-
terested students are required to at-
tend an orientation session with one
of the attorneys the LAC has on re-
tainer. The prospective member
must be interviewed by a committee
member, attend two consecutive
meetings, and put in ten hours of-
fice time.

Legal information is provided for
all types of legal problems. People
from the university community can
obtain information on divorce laws,
wills, and name changes. The LAC
also can provide ' information on
traffic violations, arrests, and
landlord-tenant problems.

Minesky said that a large number

of the cases handled by the LAC in -

September and April are landlord-
tenant problems.

“Tenants are not always aware of
the precautions they should take,
so although most landlords are on
the up-and-up, tenants sometimes
feel that landlords have taken ad-
vantage of them,” Minesky added.

When a tenant brings a landlord
problem to a committee member,
the first step in handling the pro-
blem is to call the landlord or the
realty agency that owns the
building. Minesky’ cited
“diplomacy” as the key to handling
the problem successfully.

“Problems are sometimes the
fault of the tenant,“ Minesky said.
“Tenants have duties and landlords
have duties. It is important to give

landlords a fair shake, while at the
same time protecting
students’ rights . ’ ’

Minesky also stressed the impor-
tance of “preventative
maintenance. ’ ’

“We try to make people aware of
what they should or should not do
when they rent an apartment. So far
the people on the committee have
been able to help.

   

_-——-—:————:_=,_

4:

“When a client comes in,
members are required to follow the
case through completely. People's
problems are important_ to them.
We have the responsibility of doing

for them as much as we can,”
Minesky added.

To help acquaint tenants with the
LAC and to provide them with in-
formation about landlord-tenant
responsibilities, the LAC is plann-
ing a seminar to be held within the
next month. Attorneys from the law
firm the LAC has on retainer will be
present to discuss problems with
tenants. Landlords will also be in
attendance.

The LAC judicial board subcom-
mittee represents students who are
brought before the J-Board. The
subcommittee has been highly suc-
cessful in convincing the J -Board to
reduce the sanctions it decides
upon, so it is to the advantage of
the student to seek representation
from ‘the LAC.

When a question is-brought to
the committee, the client is referred
to any of several agencies. Three
attorneys from the law - fi_rm of
Weisman, Pass and Swartz are held
on retainer. The retainer fee is paid
with monies from the student activi-
ty fee, and consultation that results
from a referal is free. Further legal

dvice on Landlord-Tenant, Other Legal Problems

services, such as research, drawing

"up papers, and accompanying

‘clients to a hearing, is provided at a
reduced rate, depending on the type
of case.

The LAC office is located in 301
Schenley Hall. To contact the com-
mittee, call 624-5922. They expect
to have a Phone—Mate answering
service soon; however, if they can-
not be reached by phone, persons

needing their service should stop at
the office. Office hours will be
posted on the door.

added.

The 12th ﬂoor appears to be nor-
mal to the extent of the number of
cockroaches and cleanliness, Lavin
said. He re-emphasized that the
area must be kept clean to stave off
the growing number of roaches.

The most effective way to prevent
rape in the Oakland, Squirrel Hill
and Shadyside areas is by the use of
simple precautionary measures that
can make the chance of rape im-
possible, according to Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape (PAAR).

PAAR, gives 168 lectures a year
in public schools and private in-
stitutions on this subject and is also
a counseling service for the victims
of a rape.

Anne Sadler, the coordinator of
the counseling service gave ad-
ditional information about the

counseling service.
“The service is to provide emo-

Members of PAAR‘ said they
considered Oakland dangerous in

One member pointed
out,“although during the day, it is
reasonably safe, due to the large
crowds, it does become very
dangerous at night and we don’t ad-
vise anyone to go out without a
friend.”-

PAAR’s aim .in its _lectures,
besides how to avoid rape by the
precautionary measures of traveling
with friends,_locking doors, ets., is

_ to make the public wake up to the

harsh reality of rape. PAAR
believes there are many prejudice-
sand social myths that cloud the
issue of rape and allow it to
ﬂourish. PAAR is working to

awaken the consciousness of the
public to the after effects the crime
has on the victim and how easily the
act can happen when ‘women are
not aware. ‘ .
' “March to Take Back The
Night”, was one of director Anne
Pride’s tactics to make Pitts-
burghers aware that the danger can
be eliminated by standing together
against it. The march was greeted
well by Pittsburghers and many

Thesound
and the Fury

Dr. John Chapman ‘recently charged that search
procedures to choose a new director of the University
Center for International Studies [UCIS] were illegal.

As a basis for these charges, Chapman calimed
that the university did not sufficiently advertise the
availability of the position.

In a widely-circulated memo among the faculty

and administration,‘ Chapman ‘also called for.
~ Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s resignation, stating that

the ultimate blame for the alleged illegalities rest
with the chancellor. ' ‘
On the other hand, Assistant Chancellor Ed Bozik
said no improprieties existed in the search process,
citing advertisements published in the western edi-
tions of the Wall Street Journal. - » ~
Provost Rhoten Smith went one step further in at-
tempting to discredit Chapman’s charges, by claim-
ing that the entire matter was not even newsworthy.
At this point, we are not about to take sides in this
faculty-administration battle. We _ aren’t certain if
Chapman was concerned more with the illegalities of

the search process or if for some reason he was bitter- _

ly opposed to the appointment of sociology pro-

fessorBurkhardt Holzner as director of the center.

Nor can we say if the university was right or wrong
in its search procedures.

The information released seems to indicate that all
bases were covered but neither Smith nor Bozik were
speciﬁc enough in their remarks to the student media
to determine if some illegalities did exist.

It would not seem journalistically ethical or in our
best interests to cite the right and wrong-doers in a
battle where all_the facts are not known.

—We have, however, made some notes on the handl-
ing of the situation by both sides.

We commend Chapman’s aggressive pursuit of

what he believes right in a time when apathy has

almost become a way of life for many Americans.
This attitude is, to say the least, refreshing.

Again, we are neither supporting nor attacking the
content of Chapman’s accusations. We are merely
admiring his fortitude in taking on not only the

university line officers but also the chancellor in‘

fighting for what he believes right.

And as for Smith’s remark that the incident in not
newsworthy, well... ' . .

Although Chapman’s charges of improprieties will
not make the year's most smashing headline,.his re-
quest for Posvar’s resignation does "not fall short of
newsworthiness‘.

When a man of Chapman’s standing and years at
the university believes a situation serious enough to
warrant the chancellor’s resignation, there is certain-
ly a story worth investigating.

Bozik and Smith were no doubt trying to down
play the incident for several reasons. Most impor-
tant, of course, is thefact that both have serious
issues facing their offices at this time.

Bozik and the chancellor’s office, having just

recovered from one term of hefty tuition increases _

are no doubt thinking of ways to avoid yet another
increase during the coming term.

Smith, too, has felt the budgetary crunch, facing
departmental program and staffing cuts, factors that
do nothing for the quality of education received by
Pitt students.

Probably Smith and Bozik would far rather spend

their time attending to these matters than dealing

with internal differences of opinion. And so, at this it
seems that Chapman, Smith, and Bozik have reached
a draw where no party stands to win a decisive vic-
tory.

Column

Billy Joel and Nuclear Weapons,

By NICK ARNETT

They say that these are not the best
of times,
But they ’re the only times I ’ve ever
known,
And I believe there is a time for
meditation in cathedrals of our
own. _
, (Billy Joel,
“Summer, Highland Falls”)
This is my first computer-
generated column. Perhaps it’s a
giant step forward for the
newspaper. . .but I doubt it. Com-
puters are handy. This one is saving
me time and trouble, making it
easier to edit. There are a lot of
people using Pitt's" computers for
the first time——it is the begining of
the semester. A lot of them stand
(or sit!) before the giant number-
crunchers in awe. They, don’t feel
like they can control the beast.
“Thou shall not have any other god
before me.” .

_ their bombs on us?

Now I have seen that sad surrender
in my lover’s eyes, *
And I can only stand apart and
sympathize. .

, ’ ‘ (ibid.)

Computers were created by men,
therefore, men can control them.
That’s not so tough for me to ac-
cept—-I’ve been able to control
computers. Nuclear weapons are
another story. They seem to be out
of control. What. would happen if
we told the world, “Hey folks,
we’re tossing out our nukes!
Throwin’ ‘em away!”

For we are always what our situa-

tions hand us. . .

It ’s either sadness or euphoria
— (ibid.)

You think Russia would drop"
Why would

they? What good would it do

—-tionship

them? If they threatened us, ‘so
what? They’d be cutting their own
throats. .
Maybe, on the other hand, we
shouldn’t underestimate their
stupidity. We’ve got a close rela-
with the Rus-
sians-—neighbors, lov’ers-op-
posites? “Love thy neighbor as
thyself.” Do we trust us?‘ “We
have met the enemy and he is us.”

(Pogo)

And so we argue and we com-

promise, _
And realize that- nothing’s ever

changed,
For our mutual experience, our
separate conclusions are the same.

‘ - (ibid.)

Who started this idea that men,

can create things‘ they can’t control
(technological idolatry)? I
sometimes feel that most of the
world is out of touch with the way
things really are. The fellows com-

peting for the right to sit in the
Oval Office (in front of The Button)
agree--we have no choice about
nuclear weapons. Gotta have ’em.

Didn't anyone ever explain to
them that bizarre problems require
bizarre solutions?

Now we are forced to recognize our
inhumanity,

Our reason co—exists with our in-
sanity. . .

And though we choose betwee
reality and madness. . . ~

.It’s either sadness or euphoria.

(ibid.)

I used to work with crazy people.
Most were patients. Some of their
afﬂictions may have rubbed on,
but maybe they made me a better
writer. They were often accused of
lacking reality-testing. Which ‘reali-
ty? “Schizophrenia” is a name for
a person who uses unusual’
metaphors. Personification, simile,
anthropomorphism, and symbolism
are the psychotic’s weapons. I use a
newspaper column.

How thoughtlessly we dissipate our
energies,
Perhaps we don ’t fulfill each
other’s fantasies. .

(ibid.)

Few of us see all of our choices.

Angels and Psychotics

Some choices are only visible in the
way our close ones (remember
Russia?) mirror us. Sometimes we
imagine things that aren’t there.
Often the choice we forget, when
faced with one of life's games, is
that we don’t have to play that par-
ticular game. ‘

You can make a joke out of
anything. “Angels ﬂy because they
take themselves lightly.” Turn off
the computer. Throw away those
nuclear weapons-they're just stan-
ding idol anyway. (Like I said, you
can make a joke out of anything.)
I’m afraid I’m still feeling the heat
from Three Mile Island. Or maybe
it was the missile the Air Force

dropped on Arkansas. Anyway, .

I'm bugged and I'm trying to figure
out how to bug ‘em back.

I’m trying to avoid being inspired
by the fear which 20-megatons
creates. Fear will keep the missiles
in their silos.‘ Fear of the Russian’s
stupidity fertilizes "them, so they
grow. The candidates, especially
that actor, are all too willing to
cultivate them. I want my silos fill-
ed with corn. (You can make a
joke...)

The Russians fear our stupidity.
Perhaps it’s time for us to have
faith.

And so we'll stand upon the [edges
of our lives...

with our respective similarities. . .
It ’s either sadness or euphoria.

(ibid.)

of the illnesses may go away for
awhile but they are ongoing pro-
blems. The children must be read-
mitted to the hospital many times
throughout their life. Some are
fatal illnesses,” said Ruth A. Suc-
cop, director of The Clinical Social
Work department in. Children’s
Hospital‘.

Succop emphasized the stress that
the child’s family must endure.

“You never know what might

happen and it’s very hard on the _

family,” she said.

The purpose of the conference is
to “develop an understanding” of
the major physical disorders of
childhood as they affect the social
and emotional life of both child and
family, according to Succop.

There are four objectives to the
conference:

--to identify the physical and ’

social effects of chronic illness on
children during infancy, preschool,
latency, and adolescence

--to give a better understanding
of the impact of chronic childhood
illness on family life

--and to promote community
understanding and professional col-
laboration supporting families of

. chronically ill children.

The keynote speaker of the con-
ference will be Georgia Travis of
the Institute of Medical Research in
San Jose, Calif., who is an
internationally-known educator
and medical consultant.

Recognized as an authority on
services to chronically ill children,

_ her major work, has been used as a

reference and textbook on the
psychosocial aspects of chronic il-

lness around the world. “Underly-

Pitt Booters Win Third Straight 2-I Over Mt. Union

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

When the Panther soccer team
takes the field this evening against
Mt. Union they will look toward the
services of fullback Jim Hackworth
to help secure the third consecutive
victory for Pitt. The big fullback
from nearby North Hills has
developed into a top-rate, very

Pitt News Sports Editor

According to head football coach
Jackie Sherrill, tomorr,ow’s game
with Maryland is the beginning of a
war in the Pitt schedule.

“We’re going to war now,” Sher-
rill said. “The next five games are
going to decide our fate. We’re go-
ing into the meat of our schedule,
and we’ll have to play extremely
I don’t think we’ll
dominate our next five opponents
like we have in the early going.”

In Maryland, the Panthers are
facingfprobably the best team they
have played to date. Maryland
comes into the game with the
undefeated and sixth-ranked Pan-
thers with a record of 3-1. The
Terps have defeated Villanova
(7-'3), Vanderbilt (31-6),, and West
Virginia (14111). Maryland had its
seven game winning streak broken
last week by North Carolina 17-3.

The Terps have totally dominated
their opponents in three of the four
games. Pitt will counter with one of
the finest defensive units in the
country. The Panther defenders
have held their opponents to an
average of only 3.7 points per
game, giving up a total of 11 points
on the season.

The defense has been talked
about for a long time now, but what
happened last week against Temple
was what pleased coach Sherrill the
most. The Pitt offense ran up 371
total offensive yards and put 36
points on the board.

“I was pleased with the progress
of the offense,” said Sherrill, “but
we still need to work on our running
game and our blocking schemes.
Maryland will be a tough test for
our offense.”

Pitt’s defensive unit is currently
ranked number two in the country
in total defense, allowing an
average of 163.3 yards per game.
Pitt’s last two opponents have been
impressed with the squad that the
Maryland offense will have to con-

tend with tomorrow.

“They are the best defensive
football team I’ve ever seen,” said
Temple coach Wayne Hardin last
week. “They look so tough on film
and they’re just as tough live and in
person. ,Thei.r defense is
devastating. ’ ’

determined defender for the Pan-
ther booters.

Although Hackworth is in his se-
cond season as a Panther he has
been affiliated with the team for
nearly three years. Hackworth was
recruited for the fall season of 1977
with a crop of incoming freshmen
who were thought to be able to
change the mediocre outcome of

sports  

' Dave Trout hopes to get a chance at breaking Pitt’s all-time field goal of 52 yards

the year before. But unfortunately
for the Panthers, personal reasons
led to Hackworth quitting the team.

“I really wanted to play soccer
when I first came here to Pitt,” said
Hackworth, “but personal reasons
drove me away from the team. Plus
I wasn't playing very much so I just
decided to quit. I took a whole year
off from soccer and started gaining

Kansas coach Don Fambrough
had this to say: “I thought they
were the best in the country and un-
til we play somebody beter, they
still are.” _

Not only are the coaches raving
about the Pitt defense, but oppos-
ing players are equally impressed.

“Man, those guys were good,”
said Kansas center Bob Fiss. “We

heard their defense was great and
now we know it is great. They’re
good--no question. They’ve got
great quickness on defense. They
moved around that field like you
couldn’t believe.”

Temple quarterback Tink Mur-
phy said, “When you play a team
like Pitt, you change your passing/
game. You can’t throw deep. You

He finally decided that he had
stayed away from the sport he loved
to play for too long. He began to
lift weights to distribute what he
had gained in body weight. His
next step was to begin playing in the
Keystone League. This league is
made up of young and old players
alike, amateurs who just haven’t

been able to make it in the pros and
an occasional ex-pro. The league
played an important part in getting
Hackworth back in shape and
creating second thoughts in his
mind about playing collegiate ball
again.

Field Hockey Team Scores Another Win, 2-1

By COLLEEN MCDONALD

It was beautiful weather for the
Pantherettes this past Tuesday as
they faced Indiana University in
their first away game. The
women’s field hockey team remain-
ed on a winning streak as they tuck-
ed away a third victory against IUP
with a score of 2-].

“Indiana has a pretty strong

team,” said Coach Martha Ludwig,

“and I was pleased with the way we
played against them.”

“Our defense was excellent. Col-
leen (Ahern, the goalie) played
outstanding. In the second half
there was never a threat to the
goal,” said Ludwig.

IUP, a team that beat the Pan-
therettes 4-0 last year, tallied the
first goal midway through the first
half but Pitt quickly made the
counter attack to tie the game 1-1 as

fifth goal of the season.

In the second half, as the Pan-
therettes continued to rush offen-
sively, forward Libby Sharp, a first-
year player for the Pitt team, pulled
them ahead 2-1 with her third goal
of the season. ‘ '

“From then on, it was a defen-
sive game,” said Coach Ludwig.

The two second division teams
battled against each other in mid-
field play for the remaining time
and Pitt with the one point advan-

Goalie Ahern excelled with 12
saves. Indiana had three times as
many corners as Pitt but failed to
monopolize on them, said Ludwig.

“lndiana came on strong and I
was impressed with their play,” said
Ludwig.

The Pantherettes will meet Hiram
next Wednesday in their second
away game. Coach Ludwig is ex-
pecting another win.

“We beat Hiram last year 6-1.
They really don't pose much of a
threat,” she said.

By CARL KORN
Maryland Diamondback Sports Editor
Editor’s note: This article was writ-
ten for the Pitt News by Carl Korn,
the sports editor of the Maryland
Diamonback which is the school’s
student newspaper. _

After gaining 470 in Maryland’s
first three games this season,
tailback Charlie Wysocki was stop-
ped short last week by a tough
North Carolina defense, rushing for
only 17 yards and fumbling three
times.

‘And as Wysocki goes; so goes the
Maryland football team.

With Wysocki piling up an
average of more than 155 yards a
game, the Terps rolled over
Villanova, Vanderbilt and powerful
West Virginia and stretched their
two year winning streak to seven

_ games. -

But last week that streak came to
an abrupt end at Chapel Hill. The
Terrapins fumbled the ball away

A four times in their own territory and

lost to the Tarheels 17-'3.
“They were just too strong of a
football team to keep them away

— from our goal line,” said Maryland

coach Jerry Claiborne.

Claiborne added that the Terps
“did everything we shouldn’t have
to combat what they did best.”

The Terps had possession of the
ball for only five minutes in the first
half and managed to run off only 14
plays. Carolina called 50 offensive
plays.

Quarterback Mike Tice had one
of his finest days as a Terrapin,
completing-14 of 22 passes for 179
yards. The 6-7 senior has not
thrown an interception this year.
For the season, Tice has connected
on 50 percent of his "62 passes for
430 yards and two touchdowns.

Split end Chris Havener caught
five Tice passes last week for 90
yards and led the receiving corps
that features Jan Carinci and tight
end Eric Sievers.

The Terps defense led by Greg
Vanderhout, Joe Wilkins and
Marlin Van Horn is ranked third
overall in the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference and had allowed only 16
points before last Saturday’s game.
Against North Carolina, the Terp
defense performed admirably, bail-
ing out the offense with key plays.

“By running 14 plays, and only
being behind 10-O, I thought we still
had a chance,” Claiborne said.

All-American place kicker Dale
Castro who hit a record 16 con-
secutive field goals last season
shook an early season slump and
pulled groin muscle to’ score the
Terps’ only points in a 50-yard ﬁeld
goal last week.

Castro also handles the punting‘

chores and is averaging 40 yards a
kick. -

The Terrapins will be playing
tomorrow and possibly therest of
the season without starting defen-
sive end Pete Glant. Glant re-
injured his right knee against North
Carolina.

Claiborne said however, that
Wilkins, who suffered bruised ribs
and a hyperextended elbow will be
ready to play.

Pittsburgh Soccer Club. I played

the whole year and enjoyed it,” said
Hackworth. "I just didn’t have it
in meto start playing for Pitt again.
Plus I knew that I had lost a lot
from the year layoff.” -

A year ago, Hackworth began to
look back into the possibility of
playing collegiate ball for his junior
year.

“I thought a lot about coming
back,” said Hackworth, “and I
talked to some people about the
idea. I thought that I was good
enough to play for Pitt and there-
fore decided to give it another try.”

That second try by Hackworth
was one of the best things that has
happened to Panther soccer _in re- 0
cent years. Hackworth had to make
a big move back to the fullback
position and defensive play, from
the front line or midfield position
he used to play;

“The switch was tough to adjust
to because I like to make runs up
field to the goal,” said Hackworth.
“I like breakaways and trying to
score.” ‘ _

Hackworth entered into a defen-
sive _unit that was already rather
solid. His tough, hard nosed type
of play ‘added to the Panther back
four. Two of those fullbacks, Tim
Liebenguth and Jerry Tomasetti,
are now gone from the Panther
lineup. The other, Tom Kunkel, is
back for his senior ‘year with Pitt.

“It took me a couple of games to
get used to being a defender,” said
Hackworth. ' ‘ll look to Tom

. Liebenguth as being someone that

has taught me well. He taught me
how to be an aggressive defender
and how to be mean when you have
to. What we lost last year with Tom
and Jerry, we gained in skill with
Don Bowen and Tom Trempus.”
Kunkel, his fellow defender,
believes that Hackworth’s great
desire is what has led-him to the

Panther Booters Win Third Straight, 2- I   A

scrappy type of play that he exhibits
in each and every Pitt outing.

“Hack is the most aggressive
player on the field,” said Kunkel.
‘,‘In going after the ball you know
he’s going to get it nine times out of
ten. His desire is just great.”

Panther freshman Phil D’Amato
remembers Hackworth ‘ from their
high school playing days‘ together
back in North Hills. During that
time Hackworth was named as an
all-star in Western Pennsylvania
and MVP of his high school team.

“He’s definitely the best player
that ever came out of North Hills,”
said D’Amato. “He goes out and
his mind into games. He’s a first
rate player.”

Hackworth feels more comfor-
table working with the Panthers of
1980 than he did a year ago. He at-
tributes much of this to the Panther

.attackers. Pitt has already scored

fourmore goals this season in six
games than they did in the entire
season of 1979. ..

“The offense makes me much
more confortable than a year ago,”
said Hackworth. “Aggressive for-
wardslike Bob (Hughes) and Eric
(Tiedtke) make an offense a big
threat in games. They force
themselves to be recognized on the
field. The entire season is different
than it was last year,” adds
Hackworth. “We’ve seenia lot of
scoring from our front line. All the
forwards. are doing well. Plus,‘

' there is a much better attitude on

the team. We want to win and
think we can win. And, more im-
portantly, We know that we can
win.” .

And what do the Pitt attackers
think of their big protector on the
left side of the defensive unit? They
know that the man that they love to
harass in practices, the one they call
“hacker,” the one that they growl
at to cut down the opposition, is
always there for their protection.

The Pantherette volleyball team ventures to Penn State for an important tournament against the best of the East.

Pcnfherette Spikers
Travel to Penn State

By SCOT STONE

Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pantherette volleyball team
plays at Penn State this weekend,
in a four—way -brawl for top spot in
the east. Pitt will face Georgetown,
Penn State, and Rutgers University.

“This is a unique tournament
because these teams are the top four
in the East,” said Pantherette
coach, Shelton Collier. “We’ll all
be using our starters and our best
players throughout the entire
event.”

According to Collier, it is very
important, at this point in the
season, for all of these squads to be
concerned with dominating the
others.

“We’ve beaten these teams every
time we’ve played _them,” Collier
said, “after losing to us they make
adjustments and come back all fired
up, that’s what is happening here.”

Collier is preparing his team for
the tournament in a number of
ways. He is working on ‘several
defensive maneuvers, and more
generally, on skill development. But
there are a few specific tactics he
plans to use against the other teams
to see how they work.

“There’s‘a couple of things we’re
going to try this weekend,” Collier
said, “but we’re not going to give
away too much of what we want to
do before the regionals.”

There is one factor, however,
that will require special attention:
Ellen Krandall, of the Penn State
squad.

“The reason that they’re dif-
ferent is because they have one
player that’s so outstanding,” Col-
lier said. “Krandall is one of the
best collegiate players in the entire
country, and Penn State relys so
heavily on her that you need to

devise an almost completely dif—‘
ferent game plans.” '

Collier doesn’t see any real way
to neutralize her, but instead will
concentrate on. stopping the more
average players on the team.

“It’s like in basketball,” Collier
said. “When you play a team like
the Laker’s, with Jabar, you know
he’s going to get 30 points no mat-
ter what you do, but you’ve got to
keep the other players from hurting
you.

“The most important thing for
our team,” Collier said, “is not tdf
go into these matches too over-
confident.

“The atmosphere in practice has
been relaxed,” Collier added. “It’s,
maybe, not so bad-this early in the
season. We’ve had a really good
record, and I’m very happy with the
way they’re playing.”

The Pantherettes, however, will
soon be facing national competition
in Houston and Cincinnati. The
tournament this weekend will
sharpen up their playing skills.

“In respect to Houston, this
tournament will be good because
there won’t be any weak division
two or three teams there,” Collier
said. “We’re going to have to play
every match with intensity. It (the
Penn State tournament) will be the
same atmosphere as in Houston.”

“I expect this tournament to be
extremely tough,” Collier said. “As
I said, Ihope we don’t go into it
over confident. But at the same
time, I think our team is playing
better than the others, and I’m hop-
ing that we can rise to the
occasion.”

Pitt faces off against Georgetown
at 9 a.m. on Saturday, then plays
Penn State at 12:45, Rutgers at 2
p.m. and goes into a play-off round
at 4:30 p.m.
