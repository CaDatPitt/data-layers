are coming out of the
mothballs for the ﬁrst Pitt '
Players’ Mellerdrammer
scheduled soon.

‘Fashion’ Players
Plan Entre-Acts
For 1850 Drama

Ballads, Skits, Clog Dances Will
Entertain Audience During
Scenery Shifts

Choo s e YMHA Stage

Between acts‘in*thé theater of the
1850’s didn’t mean smoking a cigar-
ette iii the foyer, reading the adver-
tisements on the back of the program
or seeing if Dorie Bloke was wear-
ing that loud green dress again, but
meant entertainment as good, if not
better, than the show itself.

In producing that ﬂowery melo-
drama of the ﬁfties, “Fashion; or
Life in New York,” in the YM-WHA
auditorium, Belleﬁeld avenue, Novem-
ber 15, the Pitt Players promise some
rare entre-act entertainment_ If they
ﬁnd four men good and true, a male
quartette will harmonize on “VVhy
did they dig ma’s grave so deep”
and if they ﬁnd a copy of the song
the villain Snobson will cease his
dastardly deeds long enough to warble
the old baritone favorite, “My mus-
tache is growing longer.”

Zeke, the colored servant of the
play, will probably offer “The camp
town races” and a snappy clog dance.
M_any an eye will be moist when the
heroine, Gertrude, sings the sweetest
of them all, “A bird in, a gilded
cage;” or “She’s more to be pitied
than censured.” The big duet act
will be between Farmer Trueman and
the maiden lady, Prudence, when they
join in “Cal1 me pet names.”

Among the other opuses under con-
sideration for between scenes vaude-
ville is the dirge, “Fallen by the VVay-
side" and “There is a tavern in the
town.”

One member of the cast is holding
out for “Father, don’t hit mother
with your peg leg any more,” but
so far that famous classic has been

 

the private property of the director"

of the Players.

Teats Appointed Manager
Of University Orchestra

 

Edward C, Teats, a junior in the
School of Engineering, has been ap-
pointed manager of the orchestra. His
appointment came as a result of the
resignation of Robert Hollstein, pre-
junior in the School of Dentistry, who
was forced to resign because of out-
side responsibilities,

Teats, who has been assistant inan-
ager' for the past two years, was ap-
pointed by a committee composed of
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men, M. S. Rocereto, orchestra di-
rector, and Hollstein.

The new manager issues an invita-
tion to all men interested in serving
as apprentices to report in Room 728,
Cathedral, Thursday at 6:30 o’clock.

Cathedral Might Eat
Coke But It Can’t
Use Its Steam

“You can’t eat your cake and have
it,” might be changed around to “you
have your steam but can’t use it,” so

far as the Cathedral is concerned.

The new steam line being laid up
to the wall. of the Cathedral from the
pipe line pan opposite the Heinz Me-
morial chapel will not be connected
inside the building. Even if it were
brought into the basement, lack of
complete steam ﬁttings in the build-
ing would not permit use of the steam.
However, there is a possibility that
hot water may circulate through the
occupied portion of the building before
the end of the winter.

There is about 400 feet of pipe
being laid from the Chapel. This
constitutes part of the Belleﬁeld boiler
plant operated jointly by the Carnegie
Institute, the Mellon Institute and
the University. Two 1,000-horse pow-
er boilers were added to the plant
equipment to enable it to carry the
extra load.

Underneath the 12-inch pipe for
winter use and the eight-inch pipe
for emergency and light duty use are
copper lines to carry the condensed
steam back to the plant. The water
is specially prepared to prevent it
from rusting pipes and boilers.

Noted Scientists

here on December 27. the new Mellon‘
Institute building will house the most
extensive and instructive scientiﬁc ex-
hibition ever held, says Dr. W, A.
Hamor, assistant director,

The committee on exhibits, headed
by Dr_ F. ‘C. Brown, a.nd the local ex-
hibition committee under the chair-
manship of Dr. L. O. Grondahl, an-
nounce that two-thirds of the availa-
ble ﬂoor space has already been meted
out. There will be ‘approximately
4,000 people‘ from all sections of the
.,United States and Canada in attend-
ance, and a considerably larger num-
ber of manufacturers, scientists, and
teachers from the Pittsburgh area.

Attractions at the convention will]
include, besides numerous commercial}
exhibits, demonstrations of cosmic rayj
research, deuterium, neutrons, and in-5
duced radioactivity *

For laymen who ﬁnd these weighty!
phenomena. incomprehensible, there}
will be much of interest in the present;
tation of equipment used in strato-l
sphere ﬂights, talking pictures, and,
biological discoveries. '

The exhibition will be open to the‘
general public.

 

Debaters 1 Begin
Final Tests For
Oxford Contest

A meeting of all men interested in
preparing arrangements for the com-

the ﬁfth hour in Room 211, Alumni
hall today. Freshmen and upperclass-
men, who have either tried out or
p'anned to do so, are requested to
attend.

Attorney John G. Buchanan, presi-
dent of the Foreign Policy associa-
tion, which is sponsoring the affair,

be the ﬁrst meeting of the associa-
tion for 1934-35.

Plans are being rapidly completed
for the contest, scheduled for No-
vember S in the Schenley Highschool
auditorium. According to Dr. W. M.
Parrish, coach of the men who will
meet the Oxford visitors, the two
University representatives will be
drawn from the following: T. VVin-
ston McConkey. C35; Edwin P. Banks,
C35; James J. Boyle, C35; and Israel
L. Goldberg, C36. These men in turn
were chosen from the larger group
which tried out. The two men will be
designated before the end of the
week, i .

 

 

Lack Of Electioneering ,

“Politics is extinct on our campus,”
stated Stephen Vvilson, assistant pro-
fessor of pharmacy. “The students in
the School of Pharmacy elect their
class officers without the confusion
and electioneering which is so preva-
lent elsewhere. This was clearly evi-
denced this week when the Seniors
chose their officers.”-

John Campbell and Jack Rosenberry
were elected president and vice presi-
dent and ILi1lian Cohen, secretary.
Fred Stadtlander was chosen treas-
urer and representative of the School

Future Writers Will Call Fascism
‘Capitalism ’sLast Stand ’--Dr. Graper

 

“The history books of tomorrow
will probably describe the present
fascist governments as ‘capitalism's
last stand,’ ” says Dr. Elmer D. Grap-
er, head of the political science-de-
partment.

Stating that capitalism turns to
fascism only to oppose the rising tide
of radicalism, Dr. Graper appends his
belief that dictatorial governments
are doomed. ‘

“The history of dictatorsl1ips,” says
Dr. Graper, “proves thatthey are an
unstable form of government and

their downfall is only a question of‘

time. A war or some type of crisis
will bring about the change sooner.”

In discussing Germany, Dr_ Graper
declares that reports of Hitler and his
government are probably untrue_ The
real truth is unknown to the outside
world, because of the strict censor-
ship of the press in Germany, and Dr.-
Graper believes that the German

people themselves are ignorant of
what is taking place in their own
country. 

"Versailles

“Who knows,” Dr. Graper continues,,

“whether the tyrannical rulings of
Hitler are any _ worse than those
against dissenters in other countries
such as Italy or Russia?
countries deal with objectors to their
dictatorship just as does Germany."

Although he is not in sympathy
with any type of dictatorship,
he points out that no one person in
Germany can be blamed for what is
taking place there at present. He ex-
plains, “That situation can be com-
pared to the way the Kaiser was
blamed for bringing about the World
War. Now we know how foolish that
was, inasmuch as the war was caused

“by a set of conditions which had been

coming to a crisis for many years.
Nazi Germany was also brought about
by a deﬁnite set of conditions, since
we now have the» result of'the
demands placed upon Germany by the
treaty. When Germany
could not assume the obligations
placed upon her, she naturally turned

, to fascism.”

Westinghouse Engineers Display
Artiﬁcial Lightning Bolts

One woman and over 350 men were

spectators at an exhibition of artiﬁcial
lightning presented by VVestinghousc
engineers on Thursday.

The ﬁrst act consisted of sending
250.000 volts of current through a
tlireadlike wire. As the wire blew up
it emitted a ﬂash of lightning three
yards long, accompanied by a report
that echoed and re-echoed from the
stadium walls for fully ﬁve seconds.

This ﬂash was compared to an or-
dinary bolt of lightning, and was per-
mitted to come in contact with an or-
dinary lighting system. As expected
the overload of current blew a fuse.

The same lightning was shot to-
wards a system equipped with new
type fuses containing boric acid. This
tremendous amount of voltage did
not even cause an ordinary electric

light bulb to ﬂicker, and the only ef-_

fect it had was to cause emission of
a puff of pink gas as the fuse cut off
the electric force.

Artiﬁcial lightning is a compara-

Itively new discovery, having been de-

veloped within the past two years,
but it is expected to do much toward
eliminating the enormous loss of elec-
trical equipment due to lightning.
The department of electrical engi-
neering in co-operation with Westing-
house and the University chapter of
the Junior Association of Electrical
Engineers, was instrumental in‘ bring-

I ing the exhibition here for the beneﬁt

of the students’ in the School of Engi-
neering. i

Druids Dub News

Story Erroneous

Van Ormer Refutes Account
Published Last Week

 

Statements in the Pitt News last
week reporting the resignation of Fred
Edwards, C37, as president of Druids
and the appointment of Gordon
Rauck, C37, as temporary chairman,
contrary to provisions of Druids’ con
stitution, were erroneous, according to
a declaration issued by the honorary
sophomore activities fraternity Friday.

“Rauck,” said Dale Van Ormer,
E37, new president of the group, “was
named temporary chairman of the rit.—
ual committee and not temporary
chairman of the organization, His ap-
pointment has been made permanent."

Edwards’ resignation was requested
last Monday by the point scale com-
mittee. Druids met that afternoon at
which time the information was dis-
closed that Rauck had been named
temporary leader, and that a.n election
of :1. new president would take place
the, following evening. 0 ‘

The constitution of the organization
rules that in the absence of—either
temporary or permanent——the presi-
dent, the vice president should assume
that office. Van Ormer, as vice-presi-
dent, had not been appointed Monday,
and this fact was brought out by the
Dallel‘.

Van Ormer, in his_ statement, main-
tained that “Edwards did not official-
ly tender his resignation Monday, but
rather on Tuesday night, almost at
the close of the dinner meeting,” at
which time Van Ormer took over the
office. The constitution had not been
violated in any respect, he stated.

‘Pm No Radical’! Professor

Declares, Assailing Socialism

 

Dr. McCabe Destroys “Half-Baked” Collegian Ideas On
Upton Sinclair, Unemployment

 

By Roman Lapica

A University professor swung
around in his swivel chair Friday to
greet a nondescript Pitt News report-
er.

And in 15 minutes had blasted sev-
eral ideas of half a million college
boys.

‘‘I’m no radical.” Dr. George K. Mc-
Cabe_ assistant professor of econom-
ics, confessed as a warning for what
was to follow, “In fact, I believe I'm
a Democrat. Anyway, all my people
were.”

From there the interview progressed
rapidly,

“Socialism,” Dr. McCabe declared,
“seems to have become a dead heat.
I'm not a socialist just for that reason.
Who wants to be a voice crying in
the wilderness?”

The doctor added that Theodore
Roosevelt had the right idea—-sup-
Dorting anything popular with the
public.

“Upton Sinclair has a chance, but
little more,” said Dr. McCabe. “He

has captured the state with rosy prom
ises that can’t be carried out."

The doctor, renowned for his cyni-
cism, pooh—pahed the idea of socializa
tion_

“By November 7,” he asserted, “bus-
iness willbe cheering:

“’The government is now in good
hands!‘ ”

“That means—in the hands of busi-
ness. I believe them."

He explained.

“The biggest obstacle to recovery
thus far has been lack of conﬁdence
in government, caused by the fact that
business no longer controlled govern-
ment. This is rapidly changing.

“Through continuous pressure, busi-
ness has succeeded in swinging the
government to the right. This swing
will continue more or less.”

Dr_ McCabe added he did not ex-
pect to return to the good old days but
something akin to them, “with more
government control of business which
indirectly controlled the government."

Seidl:To s s ed
In First Rush

Result Forecast

 

Before the start of fraternity rush-
ing, N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men and fraternity adviser,
made a wager with Alice Beatty, his
secretary, that he would out-guess her
in forecasting the« outcome of rush-
ing_ If Miss Beatty lost, she was to
buy Mr. Seidle a box of cigars (not
stogies.) If Mr. Seidle lost, a box of
chocolates was to be forfeited. Miss
Beatty is now eating some delicious
chocolates of the best grade.

Mr. Seidle, making a prediction for
the ﬁrst time, missed his guess by the
longest shot ever recorded in fra-
ternity forecasts. Mr. Biddle, ex-
forecaster, take notice.

Mr. Seidle predicted that 440 men
would be bid, receiving 670 invita-
tions, and that 160. would accept.
Miss Beatty predicted 510 bids would
be extended to, 360 men, _and that of
the men bid, 200 would accept. The
ﬁgures on Thursday at 5 o’clock, the
end of silence period, were: 326 men
bid, receiving 496 invitations and 124
acceptances. There are still about 50
men to be interviewed.

Miss Beatty’s guess as to the num-
ber of men bid was 80 better than Mr.
Seidle’s; the forecasting secretary al-
so outguessed Mr. Seidle by 170 in
the number of invitations, Mr. Seidle,
however, was 40 closer to the num-
ber of acceptances.

In a statement to the Pitt News, Mr.
Seidle said; ‘ ~

“From now on we'll get authorities
to do the forecasting. Imagine a sec-
rotary outguessing me.”

SFA To Consider
  Charter Changes
At First Meeting

Student Legislators Will Open
Session With Banquet At
. Club Tomorrow

Chancellor To Be Host

Amendment of the constitution of
the Student Faculty association will
probably be one of the major matters
confronting the University Assembly
tomorrow night at its ﬁrst meeting
this year.

Recommendations suggesting dis-
tribution of representation in the As-
sembly between men and women stu-
dents according to the registrar’s
ﬁgures will be presented to the As-
sembly for deliberation,

“Assembly members will be guests of
‘Dr. John" G. Bowman, -Chancellor of
the UI1iYe1‘SitY. Before the business
meeting begins, they will dine at the
University club. Dinner will be
served at 6 o’clock. ‘

If the proposed change in the con-
stitution IS favored by the Assembly
tomorrow night, a plan will be sought,
according to Leonard Marks, C35,
chairman of the Executive committee,
to guarantee proportionate represen-
tation 111 the group for women stu-
dents. Three women were elected to
the body last spring. Since that time
one additional woman has been ap-
pointed to ﬁll a vacan.cy, making a
total of four among 30 student mem-
bers in the Assembly.

Among suggested plans is one that
women students vote only for feminine
Assembly members in the future, and
that those women in the Assembly
vote only for a woman for the Execu-
tive committee So far, there are only
men students in the executive group.

Executive committee business last
week included the appointment of a
new sub-committee, under VVilson
Loos, BA35, to supervise all social
events run by campus organizations.

This body, along with the Organiza-
tions committee recently announced,
will carry out all functions heretofore
executed by the Student Relations com-
mittee of the defunct Student council.

On Loos’ unit will be Miss Isabelle
Anderson, assistant dean of women;
Sylvia Fixel, C36; Ellsworth Miller,
BA35; James Ballantyne, C36 and N.
Robert Seidle, assistant to the dean
.of men,

Margaret Lewis, C36, ha.s added to
the Organization committee under
Homer Wadsworth, C35, chairman.

‘No Funds, No
Russian’——Shelton

Language Head Scoifs At “Huge’ ’“
Demand For Course ‘

 

 

 

 

C

 

Should the Pitt News, as suggested
in a letter to the editor published in:.
\Vednesday’s issue, continue last--
se-mester’s policy of agitating for a-
course in Russian? VVhen ap-proachedi
on the question, Dr. W. H. Shelton,.
head of the modern language depart---
ment, said he had his own opinion;
about it. -.-~.:

Although he admitted there migh
be a large group on the campus in-
terested in such a course, .'Dr. Shelton
declared that only three people have
approached him. However, ﬁve ap-
plicants, whose qualiﬁcations were
questionable, have asked to teach
Russian, he said.

“’I‘he practical difficulties are more
genuine than ‘students will allow
themselves to believe,” Dr_ Shelton
asserted. “The department does not
have the funds to employ a permanent
member on the faculty to take care of
courses in Russian. Any other in-
structor, hired for a few hours a
week, might be obliged to resign dur-
ing the middle of the course and thus
give the students real cause for griev-
ance. '

Dr, Shelton said. however, that
shouldtlie students organize and pro-
duce some‘ tangible proof of a real
demand for Russian, Dr. Herbert L.
Spencer, dean of the college. and he
would listen to their request.

At The Pass
' NCE again the Greeks are trying to hold Ther-

mopylae. ,

But this time it is not Greek civilization that is
at stake but the idea of class distinction as evolved
from the fraternity systems extant upon the cam-
puses of American colleges and universities. Ac-
cording to statistics published in the New York
Times of October 7, which give results of recent
rushing campaigns, the Greek letter organizations
are destined to experience their worst year in the
history of the depression. VVithout venturing to
prophecy the fate of the beleagiired Greeks, the
Times reported conditions at Cornell, Yale and
Swarthmore. _

Cornell, well-known among eastern institutions
for its gloriﬁcation of fraternity life, suffered least
heavily of the three. Three hundred and seventy-
0ne_ freshmen were pledged, as compared with 434
last year. Only 49 out of 60 organizations attracted
pledges, however.

Swarthmore, with ﬁve national fraternities,
pledged 27 out of a freshman class of 87. Last year
64 out of a class of 110 were pinned. Of even
greater signiﬁcance, however, is the fact that a
vote by the Swarthniore women has a.bolished the
six fraternities that they had on the campus.

At Yale, two out of eight junior fraternities are
now rushing this year. Alpha Delta Pi, oldest
Greek organization, having been established in
1836. boarded up its $175,000 house and dissolved.
Psi Upsilon withdrew from the national organiza-
tion. Even now, the administration is proposing
to take over all campus houses and change them
to dining halls and to clubs for the alumni.

At the University of Pittsburgh (as was revealed
in last Friday ’s edition of the Pitt News) frater-
nities have pledged 124 men, as contrasted. with the
191 who accepted bids last year. VVhich amounts
to a decrease of more than 30 per cent.

It is useless to conjecture how much longer the
local fraternities will be able to hold together.
They have been able to meet the exigencies of the
depression, so far. It is useless, even, to point out
that the fraternity program is socially unsound——
that it breeds friction among undergraduates. That
was demonstrated forcibly by coalition conduct
last year. But it might be of some import to ob-
serve that it has taken a depression to convince

I/an Trump Reviews 1934
International Exhibition
By J. D. Van Trump

Research Fellow, Department of Fine Arts_
THE 1934 INTERNATIONAL proves to be one of the

most interesting, if not the most -sensational‘ exhibit in
several years.

On,the whole the American section is the most im-
Dresslve, comparable to that of last year and even sur-
passing it. All the better known men are well repre-
sented, and there are a few new names, such as that
of Peter Blume, whose ‘canvas, “South of Scranton/.’ took
fiist prize. The painting, which owes a great deal to
ihg Work of the Surrealistes, attempts to symbolize the
in ustrial life of.the coal mining regions of Pennsyl-
Vallla, and does it rather successfully. The theme is
tpeated after the manner of the Italian or Flemish prim-
1 1365. the techniquejis hard and dry; the color brilliant
ahh harsh, although not unpleasant, and the composition,
at ough made up of rather unusual elements, is very
well managed,

The strength of the American section is, however, the
very representative selection of works by the most im-
portaiit painters of the present, and if there is nothing
very startling, most of the pictures shown maintain a
rather high level of excellence. The painters of Amer-
ican genre are well represented—Kenneth Hayes Miller
and Reginald Marsh with their scenes of life in shops‘
George Biddle with “Folly Beach;” Thomas Benton with
“Lord: H931 the Child;’’ and, most interesting of all
Grant VVood’s “Dinner for Threshers,” with some of the
conventions of Italian primitive painting applied to the
American farm scenes with amazingly good resu1ts_

SOME GOOD STILLS

Among the paintings of still life, the work of Max
VVeber and Kuniyoshi is worthy of notice, that of the
hitter, DaI‘tiC‘d131‘1Y, with his “V/Veather Vane”—another
of his arrangements of unusual objects treated in pale
dry colors. The “Red Poppy” of Georgia O’Keefe is a
good example of her work, although not quite so success.
31] as some of her other things. Eugene Speicher and

eon Kioll have excellent nude studies, very solid in
form a.nd delicate in color. Alexander Brooks’ “Jane” is
perhaps the most interesting portrait in the American
section, very sensitively painted and with his unusually
ﬁne command of a color scale low in value. Among the
landscape painters-, Charles Burcliﬁeld and Edward
Hopper have interesting canvases, although their sub-
ject matter tends to be a little monotonous. The third
prize, “The Spring Landscape” of Sidney Laufman, is
an adequate, but not very exciting piece of work.

Some interesting paintings are_ to be found in the Ger.
man section, notably———the second prize picture —— the
“Pastoral” of Karl .Hofer, who belongs to the group of
German Expressionists. The painting is an example of
the Expressionistic preoccupation with forms and enio-
tional 1nterpretation—there curious ﬁgures outlined in
ﬂat planes of light have a certain emotional effective-
ness. Gert Wollheim’s “Terrace” is a picture of the
same type as Bluine’s “South of Scranton,” but it is ex-
ecuted in a different technique and lacks the hardness
and precision of the American work. The Italian gal-
lery is not particularly impressive. There is a curious
Severini and Funi that is too reminiscent of Picasso, a
fault that is also to be found in the work of Pedro Pruna
111 the Spanish section. In “Architecture,” Chirico has
ah lhterestlhg Symbolic canvas, but he does not bury
1115 f_0I'm111a _9h01l'gh in constructing his picture. The
Spaniard Da11’s “Enigmatic Element in a Landscape” is
fantastic and amusing.

Tlie,Russian.s have some arresting and dramatic things
—-particularly in the work of Alexandre Deineka, but they

fall] short of producing anything of outstanding artistic
va ue.

 

FRENCH GALLERY PLEASING

The French gallery is, after’ the American, the most
pleasing in the exhibit, with a number of excellent
works by painters of established reputation. Matisse is
well represented with the “Artist and His Model” and
the charming “Nude in the Interior at Nice.” There are
some very pleasant Derains painted with his usual ini-
peccable taste and artistic good sense; Marie Laurencin
is still turning out lovely but rather blank young ladies
in ﬂowered landscapes; Picasso is represented by a work
of the “classic” period and an abstract. “Still Life ‘With
Guitar,” which is a little raw in color and not quite so

_ well thought out as some of his other abstracts. Among

the best things in the gallery are two canvasses—“Flow-

-val “Timarl.v.cape, Saint—Tropez,” by Dunoyerde Se-
gouzac, well drawn and delightfully fresh in color. The
symbolic paintings of Pierre Roy, particularly the “Sum-
mer of Saint Michel,” are interesting. There is a. rather
muddy Raoul Duty and two characteristic landscapes by
Vlaminck. There is nothing in the gallery that would
provoke any violent discussion, but for pure enjoyment
of good painting the French section is well worth study-
ing,

The English section is characterized by a wide variety
of painting, all the way from the work of much older
men as VValter Sickert, Sir William Rothenstein, and
Augustus John to the modern group which is_ fairly well
represented. One of the most interesting canvases is
the “Kerry Flute Player,” by Colin Gill, reminiscent, in
its agitated manner, of Magnasco and some of the Vene-
tians of the eighteenth century. Algernon Newton's
“Norfolk Mill” is pale and not so clear and hard as his
usual Work. The paintings of Sickert, Rothenstein and
John are interesting, but not very exciting. The British
section seems more “solid” than usual, this year, despite
the inclusion of a number of moderns.

New Deal Revives
‘Abe-Doug’ Tilts
Iii Middiewest

, By Edwin Banks

’VVay back in the early 1860's polit-
ically conscious people used to have a
great deal of fun listening to a home-
ly man the "size of Mutt debating with
an energetic chap proportioned like
Jeff. Both men were effective speak-
ers; they made a lot of “good cracks”
to entertain the crowd; they clashed
on the momentous question of the
day, slavery; and each wanted to be-
come the next senator from Illinois.

That the New Deal is as funda-
mental an issue now as slavery was
just before the Civil War may be
doubted by skeptical left-wing lib-
erals. The fact remains that plenty
of people. think so. Moreover, pol-
iticians, worrying over the near elec-
tion, seem to think that the people
think so. Personalities of “statesmen”
in most states have become dis-
tinctly subordinated to issues. And
issues have narrowed down primarily
to one——-the New Deal, of course. So
whether this phrase really has any
deep underlying signiﬁcance or not,
political America is certainly stirred
up about it.

The Lincoln—Douglas pastime de-
clined in popularity but the Middle-
west has revived that interesting for-
ensic custom. In Nebraska Ed-
ward R, Burke, Democrat, is after
the United States Senatorial post
there and so is Robert G. Simmons,
Republican. They have decided to
battle it out by conducting a series of
ten joint debates throughout the
state’s Congressional districts, It is
the New Deal which will be extolled
by the former candidate and execrated
by the other.

This resumption of political de-
bates should be accepted with at least
a little enthusiasm. After all, the
conventional campaign policy is some-
what ludicrous. John Gotbux, Repub-
lican, makes a speech in the old Town
hall, and all the staunch defenders of
the Old Guard are there and applaud
vigorously, James VVantsbux, Demo-
crat, orates in the high school au-
ditorium and all the sons of the Jack-
ass inake up the audience and ap-
prove enthusiastically. In neither case
is there a direct clash of antagonistic
ideas.

Most important of all, it should
make for loads of good, clean fun.
Imagine David Reed and Joe Guffey
appearing together in a North Side
forensic tilt, each vigorously analyz-
ing the New Deal and each throwing
out pleasant allusions about the other.

How the Little Giant and Honest
Abe would enjoy it.

Injured “Between You, Me And The Lampost” Rallies
To Declare “Sins Of Lifetime Did Not Flash”

The slanting rays of an autumnal sun glanced off the polished

bumper of the front of a Plymouth, and the next

minute Clark did likewise. He ﬂew through the air with the greatest
of ease, taxied to a stop after sliding seine feet on his head, sat up,
glanced at his shoeless, practically toeless foot, gathered it into his

arms, clasped it to his breast, and crooned a lullaby.

The sins of an

entire lifetime absolutely did not ﬂash through his mind as he soared

through the air; after all it was but:

Pearlman Allegory Predicts Collapse
Of 400 Year-Old Structure By 1964

 

By Raymond Pearlman
October 21, 1964.

The noise of falling stones and
bricks was heard the world over. A
few children, lingering on their way
from school, rushed around the cor-
ner, but for the spectacle they were
too late. Only a mass of debris re-
mained. Soon a crowd gathered around
the ruins. No one wept; not a soul
mourned .

The once mighty ediﬁce, slowly
eaten away by disintegrating ele-
ments, ﬁnally caved in. For over 400
years it stood, at times a despicable
sight, at times a worshipped shrine.
Every generation built an additament
upon it—although its Janus-faced

doors were never closed. Peace it
had never realized. Strife was its
password. It was a building dedi-

cated to Mars, to slaughter, to de-
structicii.
Forty—seven years before its com-

plete decimation, two of its seventeen_

However, out of the Mediterranean
boot a giant arose, He strenglitened
the building to its pristine efﬁciency.
Bricks no longer fell; plaster no long-
er cracked . . . Misery reigned.

Then again after a short interval
ﬁnely crushed, powder-like, particles
of stone decorated the first buttress of
the structure, The identical things as
before occurred. This time giants
sprung up in insuppressible numbers.
Every industrialized country felt the
asperity of their iron hand. But this
time a strange thing happened to the
building. Its once beautiful marble
turned completely black. (It was
mourning for its own death; there
were none else to weep-). A horrible
scourge seized hold of it! Brick after
brick slowly kept falling and crum-

bling. The ediﬁce was eternally
doomed. One pillar after another fell
crumbled,

The mass of the people rejoiced, An
universal holiday was declared. At

Doric columns collapsed. Every p0s- 3 last this odious structure, the symbol

sible attempt to restore them was
.ade; yet nothing was able to rem-

of suffering, of war, of blood, was
dead. Only its ashes remained. And

edy them. That was the ﬁrst visibleil‘-Iother Earth, not wishing to pollute
llier body-—tlie ashes were too odious

manifestation of the weakness of the

building. The moneyed-class becanieleveii for her—bade her messenger
troubled. The plaster became weak- scatter the bones of the ruins over
ened; bricks kept falling. To all but he wide sea . .. ._

the most stupid it was palpable that This noise the childi en heaid, little

Defeat To Game Panthers

Gophers Come Back To Put On Two-Touchdown Drive
After Being Outplayed During First Half

By Charles A. Ruch

After being unable to locate

the fuses during the entire ﬁrst

half, Minnesota ’s Gophers were able ﬁnally to touch off their dyna-
mite in the last two quarters of Saturday ’s game and explode them-
selves all over the ﬁeld while the Pitt forces hurried in vai11 to stamp

out the explosions.

When the
raced jubilantly from the ﬁeld, the
sum total of the day’s activity in the
stadium was thus: Minnesota had 13
points to Pitt’s 7, Pitt’s undefeated
record was subject to change, and the
big, bad, bold Bierman men deﬁnitely
established themselves as ranking
contenders for the national football
championship.

The game started out in rather a
tame fashion, both teams being con-
tent to take it easy while giving the
packed house a chance to ﬁgure out’
just what men were in the lineups.

As the second quarter began, the
Panthers took charge of the situation.
Twice the Pitt boys had the ball down
in scoring territory without being
able to putit across. Then, with the
ball on their own 36-yard line, Wein-
stock started around his left end on
a fake reverse and later tossed a
lateral pass to Nicksick who com-
pleted the journey to the end zone, a
distance of some 64 yards. Wein-
stock made good on the extra point.

The half ended a minute later and
there were few customers in the
stands who would have given a bent
toothpick for the Gophers’ chances.
But when the teams returned after

last Gopher man had‘:

the rest period, there was a different
story.

At that point, the tide of battle
turned more quickly than a friend
who has inherited money.

Only Miller M,ur.ja.s’s brilliant punt-
ing kept the Gophers from scoring
during the third period. Time after
time the Minnesota backs, led by the
hard-charging bullet of a fullback,
Stan Kostka, pierced the Pitt line and
went well on into the secondary de-
fense sections.

Such a power was bound to show
results, but the results were expe-
dited by Bobby LaRue’s fumble of
one of Lund’s high punts The
Gophers took the ball from the 43 to
the goal line in very short time, al-
though the game had passed on into
the fourth quarter just before the
score came.

Alfonso, substitute halfback, made
the touchdown on a cleverly-executed
reverse play from 20 yards out.
Bevan kicked the extra point to tie
the score.

Eight minutes later the Gophers
had another touchdown, this coming
by the air route of delivery, Tenner
gathered in a pass from Lund on the
ﬁve—yard line and took the ball across
un.molested. Bevan missed the extra
point and Pitt hopes ﬂared once more.

As if in direct answer to these
hopes, the Panthers put on a drive of,
two first downs in succession and‘
were into Minnesota territory when an
intercepted pass curtailed any further
ambitions.

In Pitt’s behalf, a list of excuses
might be offered which run the gamut
from Baxter’s being kept out of the
game because of illness to the fact
that the boys were wearing a differ-
ent brand of pants than they wore in
the previous games.

These are all unnecessary excuses.
Pitt lost to a team that had more
power and, in joining the ranks of the
defeated, the Panthers are certain to
ﬁnd themselves, even so early in the
season, in darned good company_

Plebes In First Test, 12-0

"With Vince Stapulis, former Cali-
fornia high school star, leading the
attack, Pitt's freshman eleven out-
classed Carnegie Tech’s Plebe team,
12-0, in a game played at the Tech
bowl Saturday morning.

The little Panthers scored in the
ﬁrst quarter, when Stapulis tossed a.
pass to Shaw, and again in the ﬁnal
quarter, when Stapulis got away for
a 23-yard touchdown run.

Throughout the game, Pitt exhibited
an extremely rugged offense which
kept the Plebes back on their heels
most of the time. Carnegie’s defen-
sive play sparkled, however, especial-
ly in halting serious threats for touch-
downs made by the little Panthers.

Don V5/ilson Likes
Our Fair City--
Occasionally

Don ‘Wilson, ace NBC radio an-
nouncer, isn’t so very fond of Pitts-
burgh anymore. At least, he has been
heard to say that he hopes he never
sees the place again. This is not a
terriﬁc blow to civic pride; it’s just
that Don appreciates a change of
scenery once in a while,

VVi1son was here to broadcast the
Pitt-W. & J. game and came back two
weeks later to give an air description
of the Pitt-Southern Cal fracas. Last
Saturday Don was all set to tell about
the 'F"ordham-St. Mary’s game over a
network hookup of 64 stations. Then
the main office suffered a change of
heart and decided to send Wilson here
to handle the Gopher game for a
quartet of Minnesota stations.

Don was plenty burned up about it
all, because riding the trains all night
to get here and then riding the trains
all night Saturday night to be in New
_York for his Sunday evening broad
cast is not exactly a schedule guar-
anteed to keep the body in tip-top
shape, especially when it is repeated
three times in four weeks. Don just
couldn’t ﬁgure out why he had been
sent to broadcast -Saturday’s game to
the Gopher territory.

Then came the ﬂash. “I know why
they sent me. Those Minnesota
Swedes demanded me on account of
the Swedish dialect I do on Jack Ben-
ny’s program.” Such was Don’s con-
solation

The editor says we should have
mentioned before this that W'ilson
announces that program for Benny

-every Sunday evening. but we have

always been told to keep the adver-
tising at the bottom of the page.

lW.:1torial For The Panther

The course of even‘s made it necessairy for
Joe Madden, Pitt News sports reporter. to
cover the ﬁnals of the men's tennis tourney
in which his brother, Bob, was meeting Ralph

Commenting upon the fact that the story
became a family affair, some supnosed wit
remarked to brother Joe, the writer. that
such a story might be headed “Far From the
Maddening Crowd."

Joe allowed time for the hilarious laugh-

worn-out copyreading staff and then added,
“Yes, that ought to get a Hardy laugh.”

Chems In Annual
Grid Classic

By Reuben Slesinger

“One-two-three-four-ﬁve-six-seven-
eight - nine - ten-eleven-twelve-thirteen-
to nothing,” sing all of the mining stu-
dents as they rave about the over
whelming victory over the chemical
engineers in their annual football
classic that took place last week at
the practice ﬁeld.

For the second year in succession,
the pet formulae of the chems went
awry against the heavy digging of
the miners at their wall.

It was a battle marked by great co-
operation on the part; of the miners.
The reﬁners drilled holes in the line,
the metallurgists built walls of resist-
ance, the oil and gassers greased up
the passes, and the mining students .
used picks and shovels to dig holes. i

Great plays by Hurlston, Dorbaugh,
Farbaugh, Thompson, Corbett, Milli-,
gan, Hanna, Tyaher, Coleman, 'Clauss,o
Yellig, Reinman, and Daugherty fea-I
tured for the miners. (No chems were
-great because the story came from
the‘ miners, why give another depart-,
ment a break?) E

The miners scored early in the first‘ ’
quarter, and repeated later in thel
third period Moreover, they claim}

iPitt News Read
In Every Part
Of Globe

The sun never sets on the Pitt
News.

In the wilds of Venezuela, in the
trackless wastes of Nova Scotia and
in the city of romance and mystery,
Sydney, Australia, this publication is
read.

Fourteen states, the District of Co-
lumbia and the Canal Zone receive
three issues of the paper every week.
The News carries on an exchange
with most of the leading colleges of
the United States and even with
Honi Soit, student publication of the
University of Sydney, Australia.

H. D, Fine, who received his B.S.
degree in general mining at the Uni-
versity, now reads the News at the
Gorwin gold mines in Enﬁeld, Nova
Scotia, while Lieutenant A. E. Wils_on,
former assistant professor of military
science and tactics, “peruses” the col-
umns in Fort Sherman, Canal Zone.

Time will have but little effect up-
on the News. Since 1932, taking its
place with the New York Times, the
American Mercury and the United
States Daily, the News, which was
the ﬁrst college publication to do so,
has had rag paper editions of all its
issues printed. These will be legible
for 300 years.
