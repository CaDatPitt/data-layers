VOLUME EIGHTY-ONE, ISSUE TWENTY-TWO

Thirteen candidates will begin the
annual campaign for student govern-
ment posts this Wednesday.

Philip Moyer and Jay Rothstein are
the two presidential candidates.

Moyer, 21, is a junior computer
science and philosophy major from
Reading, Pa. ' '

’’I’m concerned with the great,
great need to make Oakland safe,”
said Moyer. He plans to do this by
making the university work with cit-
y and community authorities to find
a solution. His first step would be
either to appoint a committee to at-
tend or to personally attend City
Council and Safety Commission
meetings.

Strategist says latentnuclear weapons are

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

Latent forces are instrumental to the
United States in gaining an advantage
in the nuclear arms race, according
to superpower strategist Keith Payne,’
executive vice president of the Na-
tional Institute for Public Policy.

In a lecture at Forbes Quad on
Thursday, Payne discussed the preci-
sion and calculation necessary to
maintain an effective deterrence
systemand how crucial deterrence is
to a nation's defense. ,

Payne said that for a deterrence
system to operate effectively, another
country must believe that you have
the capability to manifest your threat
and that you are intent on using it if
necessary.

Moyer also wants to bring about a
student referendum for divestment
from South Africa and present it to
the board of trustees. '

He intends to encourage student
interaction by setting up what he calls
a ”university night-club.” This night-
club would be non-alcoholic and

- owned and operated by students.

Jay Rothstein, 20, is a junior
philosophy major from Villanova, Pa.
’’I am currently on the board; my
opponent is not,” said Rothstein,
who is the business manager on the
present Student Government Board.
Rothstein is concerned with cam-
pus safety and the current campus

- housing shortage. He also wishes to

follow up on the current board's

measures in favor of divestment.
There are 11 board candidates.

The nuclear deterrent is a device
the Soviet Union uses to shape the
behavior of the United States, and
one which the United States uses to
shape the behavior of the Soviets, ac-
cording to Payne.

The United States justifies the use
of nuclear arms, citing that’it had
taken on certain responsibilities, and
deterrents help carry out those
responsibilities.

”They [nuclear weapons] are useful
in their non-use,” said Payne. Payne
also said the United States_ would
resort to nuclear deterrents to prevent
attacks on its allies, specifically
Western Europe. '

But because the U.S. threat of
deterrence is very real to the Soviet
Union, Payne questions the likeli-

hood~of a»Sov.iet attack on Europe.-

junior math major from Ivyland, Pa.,
is concerned with the issues of divest-
ment from South Africa and relieving
the student parking problem in
Oakland.

Fiora Boehm, 21, is a business and
communications major from Lan-
caster, Pa. Boehm would like to see

more student involvement. She also .

is concerned with input from students
about faculty and teacher assistants.
She would like to address student
complaints about teachers ”who
don't speak English well enough to
be understood by [their] classes.’’

Boehm is concerned with the stu-
dent living conditions and making
improvements in the dorms and other
student facilities. .

Junior Rosemary Cardone, a
20-year-old heaith records adminstra—
tion major from Warren, Pa., is con-

Payn,e said what provides a deter-
rent to the United States may not be
a sufficient deterrent to the Soviet
Union. ”U.S. policy has been
oriented on the lines of mutual
vulnerability. If both sides are
vulnerable to a nuclear attack  then
neither side is going to behave with
a provocative action,” he said.

But the Soviet Union may have
doubts about the United States’ first-
strike capability because they believe

that by striking first-, the United States ‘

would be committing suicide. For

this reason, it is essential to'raise the

nuclear threshold through conven-
tional forces,.according to Payne.

' more credibili,ty.in the notion that the

United States will use'lim_ited nuclear V

Cardone. '

science major Roan J. Confer, 21,

student from Keystone Junior College
in Wilkes Barre in his second
semester at Pitt.

to attack the Soviet command struc-
ture,” said Payne.

According to Payne, in order to
maintain a circumstance of mutual
vulnerability, a force must be able to
survive a first strike and be capable
of retaliation. During SALT I negotia-
tions, the United States wanted to in-
sure stability by proving our
retaliatory capability, and to insure
that mutual vulnerability would
continue.

Payne said thesuggestion that the
Soviet Union does not have a deter-
renceconcept is false, they just have
a different approach. He said that the
Soviet Union is trying to find a way

Specter

comes to
his ‘own

defense’

By Christopher Sepesy

Sta ff Writer .

’’If we keep working as hard as,we
have been, we're going to win this,
and win it big!”

These were the sentiments of Sen.
Arlen Specter spoken at a fund-raising
dinner given in his honor last Thurs-
day at the Hyatt Hotel downtown.

Specter is the incumbent Republi-
can candidate for the Senate running
against Democrat Bob Edgar. He has
been a senator from Pennsylvania for
the past two terms.

County Commissioner Barbara
Hafer commented that Specter has
been so popular in both policy and
practice that Democrats and
Republicans alike are endorsing him
and helping to-support his campaign.

’’It is wonderful to have the turnout
we do — not just here tonight [at the
dinner], but statewide. People are
seeing the right man to elect, and that

-man is Arlen Specter,” said Hafer.
In his speech, Specter highlighted  ..
the recent rage of mudslinging in op-7 - ‘-

ponent Edgar’s broadcast announce
ments.
”l n a debate we had, my opponent

\accused me ofthrowing mud. I told-
him he had better start watch_"ing;g
television. I have continuously accen- . . "

tuated the positive in this campaign/'1

said Specter. ”However, I know V

when false truths and inconsistencies

"are thrown at me, and I will come to _,
my own defense. l,think l have

shown this to voters. In regards to my
opponent, I have not spared the rod,
and I have spoiled the child.”
Specter said he feels his time spent
already in the Senate has been ex-

tremely productive and needs to be ’ ,
lengthened in order to be solidly ef- y_ " -

fective.

”What I try to prove to my.associ-
ates in Washington is Pennsylvania,
and western Pennsylvania in par-
ticular, needs special help,” said
Specter. ”We have already done a lot
with the rail systems, the Pittsburgh-
based defense complex [CMU-Pitt]
and the Southern Express Way, just
to name a few. This all must continue
so that our citizens will be able to

useful  

Payne said he doesn't think the

Soviet Union can accomplish this,‘
.even

if they put tremendous
resources into defense mechanisms.
But, he said, when one takes into ac-
count that they have deployed
10,000 surface missiles,-that amount
does not seem erroneous.

It is evident that the United States
has made a complete turn—around in
their defensive strategy, according to
Payne. ”[Whereas the United States]
banked on the benefits\of mutual
vulnerability in March 1983, when
President Reagan presented SDI, the
United States was more concerned
with defending itself, so that the
United States could defend retaliatory
the Soviet Union has.

  
 

 

’MOSCOW —- Superpower rela-
tions could suffer further damage
from "the expulsion of five U.S.
diplomats yesterday.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry has
_ ordered the expulsions because of
”.impermissible activities" of the
diplomats, four stationed in the
Moscow embassy and one with the
U.S. consulate in Leningrad.

It has yet to be determined whether
the act was a retaliatory effort by the
Soviets for the expulsions of 25 Soviet
diplomats from the United Nations in
New York last week.

Peace marchers

' PHILLIPSBURG, N.J. — Weary
peacemarchers madeitheir way into
the New Jersey town of Phillipsburg
Sunday, winding down a 3000-mile
trek that began nearly a year ago in
Los Angeles.

The Great Peace March for Global

A Nuclear Disarmament passed

through Pittsburgh nearly three

r weeks ago. The marchers plan to ar-
rive in Washington, D.C. either Nov.
14 orZ15, and they plan a large dem-

The leaders of the march said they
want a comprehensive nuclear test

 

 

Five U.S.

ban, a verifiable nuclear test freeze
and an assurance from the U.S.
government that nuclear weapons
will not be put into outer space.

Doctors rip FAA
drug procedures

PITTSBURGH — Physicians investi-
gating allegations that many pilots
have abused drugs blasted the
Federal Aviation Administration for
lax detection procedures.

According to the doctors, the ”test”
for drug abuse does not include a
blood or urine test, thus requiring an
airline to basically rely on a pilot's
word. ‘

In a -published article Sunday, The
Pittsburgh Press found that some of

’ the tests are as brief as the pilot's fill-

ing out the form.

down on Oct. 6.

Close call‘ for

ALBANY, N.Y. — The Federal Avia-
tion Administration revealed Satur-
day that President Reagan had a close
call while Air Force One was flying
over Western Pennsylvania last
week.

The FAA said that a military pilot
did not realize he was flying too close
to‘ the president's plane. Colonel
James Cook said he did not hear an

air traffic controller's warning tel|i_ng ‘

him he was flying at the same altitude
as Air Force One and was less than

- Cook was apparently on his way

New York to a Florida air show in an
F-4 fighter.

Arms talks continue;
negotiator optimistic

Iceland —— While President Reagan
is maintaining that failure to reach a
mutual agreement with the Soviets
rests on their insistence to limit SDI
research to laboratories, American
arms negotiator Max Kampelman ex-
pressed optimism on current talks in
Iceland. Kampelman said the United
States and Soviet Union are nearing
an agreement which would limit de-
ployment of short-range nuclear
missiles i_n Europe.

It remains unclear whether the
Soviets will accept any arms proposi-
tions related to ”Star Wars” or if they

_will settle for separate agreements on
medium—range missiles. A

Kampelman hopes talks can be ar-
ranged within six months to discuss
the issue of reducing the number of
intermediate and short-range mis
siles.

 Dept. of Energy calls on Pitt profs for

By Theresa Costello

For The Pitt News

Three professors from the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh spent the summmer
doing research for the US. Depart-
ment of Energy. A

Two of the professors, Dr. Alan
Brainard and Dr. Gerald Holder, both
from the chemical engineering de-
partment, did their research at the
Pittsburgh Energy Technology
Center. The third, Dr. Ronald
Neufeld from the civil engineering
department, was at the Pittsburgh
Research Center.

Neufeld, an environmental
engineer, worked with the Bureau of
Mines at one of their environmental
control facilities on the problem of
abandonedmine fires in Pen'nsylva-
nia and West Virginia. Neufeld said
his work was ”to develop intuitive
ways to control the fires.”

These fires are a problem because
they are hidden underground and

can smolder for decades. The re-
searchers developed a way to make
the fires both environmentally safe
and economically beneficial.

The method they use is called
”burnout control.” The coal is
burned in a controlled situation and
under supervision. Neufeld said that
by ”doing that they can generate both
heat and energy to sell to the local
power plants.”

Another purpose of this research is
to find a way to burn waste cheaply
and safely. The mine fire’s tempera-
ture is high enough to burn all of the
waste pile, which acts both as the in-
cinerator and as part of the fuel

' SOUI’C€.

Brainard’s project also centered on
coal. Susan Wright, a representative
for the DOE’s contractor, said
Brainard ”was trying to develop cor-'
relations among coal physical proper-
ties using data extracted and
manipulated for the National Coal
Technology Data Base Center.”

The tools Brainard was using were
the electronic computer equipment
available at the Pittsburgh Energy
Technology Center.

fluids, which are compounds that
cannot be compressed into liquid
form. The machine Holder is work-

tion unit.

and its various methods," said San-
dra Plant, a representative from the
DOE.

Some of the methods included in
the FDU are distillation and liquid ex-
traction from the critical fluids.

The program with which the three
professors were involved is called the
Faculty Research Participation Pro-
gram and is administered by Oak
Ridge Associated Universities, a non-
profit, private organization of 49 col-
leges and universities. Each professor
must apply for a position, and he is
paid his regular teaching salary that
he receives from his university. This
year there were 58 faculty members
from 45 different colleges and univer-
sities.

”For nearly 40 years the FRP Pro-
gram has provided valuable research
opportunities to the university per-
sonnel,” said Dr. Alfred Wohlpart,
chairman of the Oak Ridge Programs
Division. ”The letters in’ our files

Each of the professors can return to

Neufeldtbelieves that the students
he will be teaching this year will
benefit from his research, as will his
colleagues. He is also on the advisory
committee of the Environmental Re-
search Program, where he will be
able to inform his colleagues of the
various methods he has used and that
other faculty members have de-
veloped.

In the FRP Program, there are three
types of appointments: summer
research, sabatical leave for up to
nine months and participation on a
part-time basis - up to two days per
week throughout the year.

The deadline for application for
next year's appointments is Jan. 30,

Bob Travers, Sports Editor

. activities. They were denied on the grounds that a wrestling match

would not benefit students. —.

A few months ago, the Greeks were ordered toobserve a "dry rush"
— they were ‘not allowed to serve any alcohol at any rush functi/ons.
No questions asked, no deliberations allowed, period.

Those responsible forthese dictates are members of the Office of
Student Activities. Why is it that the Greeks are denied such things?
The IFC and Panhel are made up of representatives of the Greek com-
munity. They are all students. Some of the things that are suggested
and passed by these two offices are rather strange. They agree to things
that seem almost suicidal sometimes, and they never appear to put
up any kind of protest —— save for the dry rush. Who's controlling
their actions? ~

The reason for the denial of the wrestling match is still a mystery.
The Pitt News finds the logic behind "it would not benefit the

, students” to be extremely confusing. Students would attend for enter-

tainment, and the money would go to the Greek Week charity, which
would bring prestige and respect to Pitt's Greek community and to
the school. That seems to be beneficial to the students.

At this time last year, the issue of Louis Farrakhan’s speaking at
Pitt was a hot topic for everyone. In which facility did he deliver his
address? Why, the Fitzgerald Field House of course. Did Farrakhan’s
speech benefit the students? Answer that one for yourselves.

The protests by the people of Pittsburgh and the threats of violence

"from anti-Farrakhan activists did little to enhance our prestige.

. So Greeks, don't take this treatment. The Pitt News supports your
efforts in protesting the sometimes dictatorial edicts passed by the
Office of Student Activities.

A response to a
common inquiry

A letter to the editor:

Two quick questions to The Pitt News editor and his advertising
department.

I. Who is paying for the numerous advertisements concerning Deb-
bie Pfendler and Mark Medica and their campaign for homecoming
king and queen?

2. Is this fair, considering the other candidates had to pay for _their
own advertisements?

Christopher Ziance

This is not the first time this question has been asked of us. So,
Mr. Ziance and anybody else who would care to know, here it is:

The answer is we, The Pitt News, do. And yes, it is fair, consider-
ing that we are the sponsoring organization. We do not lay out the
money for the ads in hard cash, but the space we allot to our can-
didates is space normally reserved for paid ads. Because we adver-
tise for Mark and Debbie in the paper, we are actually losing money
that could go into our working budget. Let it be stated for the record
that we spend no Student Activities funds for those ads.

When other organizations place ads for their endorsed candidates,
from where does the money come? Could it be that they pay for them
from the money they receive from Student Activities? Let us hope not!

When one places an ad in The Pitt News, the money goes to sup-
port the paper. The question posed in Mr. Ziance’s letter is, in effect,
"Do you take money out of your budget to put money back in it when
you buy the ads?” Doeshis question make any sense? No.

All other student groups are welcome and encouraged to place ads
for their respective candidates.

Homecoming ramblings

Homecoming 1986. What does
that mean to the typical Pitt student?
Well, for most it meanswatching the
parade on Thursday night and going
to the football game on Saturday
afternoon. That's it. However, for a
select few of Pitt's elite it means
something completely different —
homecoming king and queen.

I can certainly tell you that I am ex-
cited about this year-’s race for the
most coveted of Pitt's honors. I mean,
to be judged by a group of your peers
and be selected as king and queen of
the entire university breathtaking.

Then this silly thought jumped in-
to my brain, right in the middle of my
euphoria. What does it take to win
the race and become a homecoming
king or queen? Is it great grades? Is
it a record of exemplary community
service? Is it superior athletic per-
formance? The answer to these and
any related questions is no, no and
finally, no.

You see, this is the kind of race that
has become a symbol of our great
country. It is a race where anybody
can win, regardless of who he or she
is and regardless of what he or she
has done. Kinda like the guber-
natorial race that's coming up. This
is a popularity contest.

What better way to gain the respect
of your fellow students, your friends
and parents than to have them know
that you were indeed a homecoming
king or queen? I know that I would
have been proud to relay that
message to those close to me, but
you see, I lost. — -

 

PATTERSON '

It was four years ago, at a small
prep school a couple hundred miles
east of here. It was homecoming. We
won the big game. The gym was
decorated as it never had been
before. There was dancing and
youthful celebration. Then, all was
quiet. The votes were in. Some long-
haired Bon Jovi worshipper from the ‘
band was announcing the home-
coming court and, finally, the king
and queen. I kinda knew that I would
make at least the court because I was
part of the ”in’_’ crowd and on the
football team. There were to be five
couples announced with the last be-
ing the royal couple. They an-
nounced the first three, and my date
and I weren't mentioned. Then came
the fourth couple. Our names were
announced. My date threw her arms
around me and hugged me so tight
that no one could tell that I was
pissed. I wanted to know who had

beaten me out. Of course, it was my
best friend and his date, Mr. and Mrs.
student council. Needless to say, I put
on a happy face and tried to disguise
my "disappointment. But, since that
day, I've had a sour taste in my
mouth when it comes to homecom-
ing kings and queens.

Now don't get me wrong: I don't

' want to take the wind out of any-

body's sails. If you or your group is
supporting a candidate for homecom-
ing king or queen, then by all means,
grab votes for him or her. Let them
take that ride around the track next
weekend. Let them know that you're
behind them every step of the way.

Just one last thing. Just supporting
someone doesn't mean that he or she
will win. Have you noticed people's
Xeroxed faces staring back at you
when you go through the revolving
doors of the Cathedral or when

you're daydreaming in the middle of -

class? These are the same people
who've been standing in the Towers
lobby saying ”hi" to people they
don't know. They are the ones who
are running for the royal crown. They
are the ones who have spent money
and time on this thing. So go out to-
day and vote for somebody. It doesn't
matter who you vote for, just vote. If
you're stuck, vote for Debbie and
Mark from The Pitt News. It'd make
life in the office much more bearable.
For the couple who gets runner-up,
I can sympathize. My suggestion is
that you hope that the couple who
wins has had nude photographs
taken years back and that Bob Guc-
cioni gets his hands on them.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 20, 1986 -

Vote for
the ugly
people!

I hereby cast my ballot for
homecoming king and queen for the
ugliest candidates available.

Their names shall be withheld as
their parents have suffered enough,
but you already know who they are.
Look for them on the poster of
homecoming candidates. They are
clearly the blemishes among the
beauties. They would be favored only
if the balloting determined the poster-
child for facial surgery.

But they have my vote.
And they should have yours, too.

Face facts. Everybody knows who
will win. The best-looking guy and

the best-looking girl, of course..

Crowned king and queen, their heads
will expand to dimensions requiring
scientific notation. They will drink
only imported beer at either Peter's
Pub or Doc's Place, but never, never,
never at Zelda's Greenhouse or the
Sanctuary.

It goes without saying they will live
happily ever after.

But consider the ugliest candidates
available. Imagine the emotional tor-
ment of finishing last in the balloting,
their token votes coming from their
sponsor organization that tricked
them into candidacy in the first place.
When their parents ask about the
election, they will have to tell them
something other than that they fin-
ished dead last. When their boyfriend
and girlfr  scratch that. Nobody
would date anyone that ugly.

It goes without saying they will live
miserably ever after.

JOE ZEFE

Granted, the homecoming king
and queen contest measures little
more than popularity. There are no
issue-oriented candidates. There are
no debates to bring out their virtues
and vicissitudes. Their platforms rest‘
on the single campaign promise that
they will look their best when riding
in the back seat of a convertible in
the homecoming parade. There is no
need for an election; simply pin a
flower onto the prettiest girl in the
school and let's get on with the rest
of our lives.

But look again at the poster. Look
at the ugliest candidates available.
They need your vote. Actually, they
need to see a dermatologist, but your
vote will have to do. Understand that
these people consider themselves
candidates for homecoming royalty;
it is therefore apparent that they have
not yet come to terms with their
ugliness. Your vote for someone
other than the ugliest candidates
available will only confirm to them
how ugly they really are.

You don't want that on yourhands.
The eventual king and queen don't
need your vote to tell them how
beautiful they are. They already
know. Instead, make the ugliest can-
didates available happy. They are
ugly and have no place to turn.

Give them your vote.

BOB GREENE

The sure—fire movie hits each sum-
mer are films about teenagers who go
through the joys and heartaches of
young life and young love in contem-
porary America. Generally the teens
in these films are _sleek, attractive
boys and girls who dress stylishly and
who — even though theyhave typ-
ical teen-age problems — manage to
emerge all right in the end. 1

A staple in many of these films is
the prom scene — the night when the
boys and girls go to their senior prom.
The prom serves as symbolic sum-
mary of all that has happened to the
boys and girls during their years in
school.

Well, there was a school prom held
recently at the Glenkirk School in
Deerfield, l|l., but it was not the kind
of prom that anyone makes movies
about. The Glenkirk School serves
boys and girls who are moderately to
severely mentally retarded and who
may have physical handicaps as well.
The prom was open to approximate-
ly 80 Glenkirk students between the
ages of 14 and 21. Here are some
observations made by an adult who
was at the Glenkirk prom:

”The theme of the prom was ‘Dan-
cin’ in the Dark,’ and it was held in
the school gymnasium. The prom
started at 6 p.m. A few hours earlier
the students had ridden the school
bus from the school back to their

group residential home, about 30
minutes away. At the residential
home they changed into the clothes
they had picked out for the prom.

’’I suppose that it was fairly easy to
tell that this was not the prom at a
regular public high school. There was
a lot of chaos, right from the begin-
ning. These students are not sophis-
ticated in the art of acting cool —- they
express their emotions very openly;
they don't try to hide things.

”P|us, someone. from a regular
public high school would have no-
ticed that many of our students were
conversing in sign language; the ones
who are non-verbal do that regular-
ly. Some of them carried communica-
tion boards, so that they could
exchange ideas through the display
of pictures on the boards.

”There was a boy named Bob. He‘

has been to our proms before, and
this time he came dressed in a tux-
edo with a boutonniere —— the only
boy dressed that way. He wore a
smile that spread from ear to ear. He
was one of the lucky ones — his
mother came with him, and he pro-
ceeded to introduce his mother to
everyone. it was clear that Bob was
we|l—rehearsed in the all-important
social amenities. He was delightful
and charming with the small talk. sav-
ing to his fellow students, ’My, you
look nice tonight,’ or to the father of
another student, ’Oh, but you're a big
guy, did you play football?’
”There were so many stories like
that, [like] the girl who left the dance
floor and went to the school office to
put on her lipstick. Somehow she had
figured out that it was not proper to
put on the lipstick in front of others.
[There was another] boy who had

‘carefully planned his oufit three

weeks in advance of the prom, and

for special kidss

Even though it was hot on the dance,

 

floor and everyone was perspiring,

heavily, he refused to take.his suiti '

jacket off — it was too important'_t_o "-

him. ' ..
”The students had spent long hours
learning to dance, and they sensed

that it was proper to act very mature- T

at the prom. And they succeeded .— .

they all did wonderfully. Even the

man who drives the school's char- _
' tered bus. every day sat at the prom
watching ‘his’ kids dancing, -and.

although he didn't say verymuch,/9

you could tell how moved he was .  A A

the whole evening.

”Prom night is special to any young’ ”

person, but for the students at

Glenkirk, it takes an even greater -

meaning. It is not just anotheriend-—
of—the-year dance —- it is a dress.

I

rehearsal for the innumerable social:
skills.these boys and girls will need. .

to eventually attain normalization ——
to fit into a normal society.

”And that's what was so hearten- - '
ing about the evening. The emotions 

the students were displaying were the _
same emotions that you would ex- ‘

pect to find students displaying at a
prom at a regular school =.——- but it

seemed to mean so much more here, .

because the stakes were so much
higher. P e

”For a while, it was even possible _

for somerof us to forget that this
wasn't just any school prom. But then

the bus loaded at 10 p.m. to take the -

students back to their group residen-
tial home, and we were reminded

that this wasn't just another prom.” -

No, they don't makemovies about
proms like this one. But if they did,

the audience might walk away feel- 
ing something very special.

I took part in the spring 1986
voyage as a staff member. Since my
return, I learned that many of the

experience as a pivotal point in their
academic careers as well as in their
personal lives.

Scott Koontz, a University of Pitts-

voyage, commented on the academic

In addition to seeing the natural

simply to be hospitable. It was not

”Lots of people helped me get
around, especially when I was in

‘Hong Kong. I never felt threatened by

people, wherever I was. it annoys me
when I hear that people are afraid of
a terrorist threat,” said Nancy
Hallock, head librarian on the
voyage.

Sometimes, relying on the kindness
of strangers is a necessity. Moser
related an unfortunate experience
that made her realize that ”some
things are more important than what
only affects you.” When she was in
Japan, she left her passport and purse
on a train. To get her belongings
back, she had to return to the station
and fill out a form — in Japanese. On
the way to the station, a Japanese
women who spoke English walked
up to her and asked if she was a
Semester at Sea student. She had read

an article about the program. if that _

woman had not gone to the station
and spent 40 minutes writing out the
entire form for her, the student may
not have found her passport. Reflect-

ing on the harrowing experience, J

Moser said-she is now less likely to
turn the other way when someone,
especially a foreign visitor in the

United States, is having trouble of this _

kind. ”An experience like that
changes a person,” she said.

 

Semester at Sea is not merely a trip
around the world. With the combina-
tion of thought—provoking courses
and field trips, the program can
educate and change those who take
part in it.

Departing from Nassau, Bahamas,
the spring 1987 voyage will begin on
Jan. 27, and the fall 1987 voyage will
begin on Sept. 11.

Costs for the 100—day voyage range
from $8,945 to $10,575, depending
on cabin accommodations. Certain
types of financial aid may transfer,
and work study positions are award-
ed each semester.

ln preparation for the Children of
War Tour coming to Pittsburgh next
month, Pitt's United Campus Ministry
sponsored a benefit rock concert
Saturday night in Benedum Hall.

Local bands A.T.S., The Dubb
Squad, Between the Beat and Car-
sickness donated their time to raise

A funds to help defray the cost of the

tour that will take place in mid
November.

Josh" Arnson, guitarist for A.T.S.,
said, ”We’re donating our time
because we all believe in world
peace. The whole arms race is
disgusting and people's ignorance is

really scary. |fwe’re not careful we're
all going to die soon.” A

A.T.S. opened the concert, fol-
lowed by The Dubb Squad, Between
the Beat and Carsickness.

The concert's organizer, the Rev.
Robert White of United Campus
Ministries, was a little disappointed
with the low turnout. ‘

The main objective of the Children
of War Tour, scheduled to be in Pitts—
burgh in November, is to unite young
people from war-torn countries with
their peers around the globe, in order
to build a worldwide network of
peace. Along with these teenagers,
T8 U.S. students will be touring to
represent the youth peace network.

Plays like this against Kentucky Friday night led to Pitt's 12th consecutive victory.

O’Shaughnessy unexpected hero
in volleyball win against Kentucky

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers volleyball team
defeated the Kentucky Wildcats last

Friday night at Fitzgerald Field House

to increase their winning streak to 12
games. , _
The victory improved Pitt's record
to 21-5 overall, 7-0 in the Big East.
’’I’m real pleased. Kentucky is a
strong team, so this is a big win for
our program,” said Lady Panther
head coach Shelton Collier of his
team‘s 15-12, 15-13, 13-15, 15-9

win.

One of the key performers in Pitt's
win was junior Louise O’Shaugh-
nessy. ”The Kentucky game was a
real challenge. This is a great step.
Now we know we can beat teams of
high caliber," said O’Shaughnessy,
who recently suffered a concussion
and only had one day of practice
before the match.

At one point in the third game, the
Lady Panthers were down 10-3 but-
rallied to 10-9 before finally losing
the game 13-15. According to team
captain senior Sue Hoover, the loss

in the third game motivated the team.
”The encouragement we got from
our coach helped when we were
downin the third game, and we
came back strong,” said Hoover. ’’It
was a total team effort."

Pitt sophomore Denise Frawley led
both teams with 19 kills, while
Hoover was second with 15. '

”Mentally and physically, the team
stuck in the match/'1 said Frawley,
who played an excellent match.
”Our two big comebacks when we
were down showed that we kept our
energy and spirits up.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 20, I986

Congemi makes the grade, but others don't

Now it is time for midterm grades

— on the Pitt football team! This gives

everyone an opportunity to see how
this writer feels the Panthers have

j done in the first six games of the

‘season.
The performances of the offense,

I defense, special teams, certain in-
dividual players and first—year coach .

Mike Gottfried will be evaluated.
OFFENSE — While quarterback
John Congemi’s passing yardage
through six games (1,359 yards) is im-
pressive, the Panthers have failed to
run the ball effectively (3.5 yards per
carry). This is partly due to Gottfried's
fancy for the passing game.
Consistency, as it always has been
for.Pitt, is a problem. The Panthers
piled up 89 points in wins over Pur-
due and West Virginia, but have

scored only 23 total points the last_

two games. GRADE — C

DEFENSE — As has been the case
the past three seasons, the Panther
defense is among the nation's best for
three quarters of football, but when
the fourth quarter comes along, they
always lose their poise.

The Notre Dame game was a
perfect example. With a minute re-
maining in the game and Pitt leading
10-9, the Irish went from their own
24-yard line to the Pitt 23 in two
plays, putting themselves in position
to win. Everyone knows what hap-
pened next. Pitt was lucky, to say the
least. They were not so lucky in the
fourth quarter of the Maryland and
North Carolina State games. GRADE

BILLY OSBORN —— When Reggie
Williams went down against Purdue
with a leg injury, the Panthers need-
ed a lift at the receiver spot. Osborn
has answered the call. He is improv-
ing every week. While he doesn't
have great size or speed, the bottom
line is that he's a winner. The Pan-
thers could use more players like
him. GRADE — A

CRAIG HEYWARD —- ”lronhead”
has played well in the tailback slot,
but somebody has to convince him
that his weight (somewhere around
255-260) hampers his running abili-
ty. GRADE — B- -

TOM BROWN -— Brown is the un-
sung hero of this 1986 Pitt team. He
plays well every week and rarely
makes mistakes. GRADE — B ,

MARK STEPNOSKI and RANDY
DIXON —— These two excellent offen-
sive linemen often don't get the at-
tention they deserve. Dixon is a first
round pick, while Stepnoski, only a
sophomore, could leave Pitt as its
best lineman ever, behind, of course,
Bill Fralic. GRADE — A

TONY WOODS —— To this writer,
Woods is an enigma. He possesses
all the athletic talents of a great
player, but I'm not so sure he's
played like an All-American this

I season. GRADE — C

BILLY, OWENS and GARY

I RICHARD — They are the two pillars

of Pitt's much improved defensive
secondary. Both have shown signs of
greatness this season. And_to think
they are both only juniors. Watch out
next season. GRADE — B-

STEVE APKE — A great game
against Notre Dame saved this senior
linebacker’s mark. He hasn't played
that well this year, and he is certain-
ly not All-America material. GRADE

Report

Continued from page 16

MIKE GOTTFRIED — Obviously,
he is a much better coach than his
predecessor, Foge Fazio. Gottfried’s
complex offensive schemes have
pumped life into a Panther offense
that was stagnant for most of last
season. Although I still insist he
passes the ball a bit too much.

Besides that, there are not any ma-
jor faults he can be blamed for. Re-
member, Gottfried is coaching
Fazio’s players. GRADE — B

Now it is time to pick the three
most disappointing Panther players
this season. Every team, good or bad,
always has surprises. The play of
Congemi, VanHorne and Osborn has
been a spark, but 

MARK BRASCO — First he can't
kick field goals, then he can't even
get the ball close to the end zone on
kickoffs. Enough said.

CHARLES GLADMAN — His occa-
sional ”fumblitis” doesn't sit well
with Gottfried. Still, Gottfried needs
to give him more playing time, which
is something he said he intends to do.
If not, who knows  a possible pro
career could fade away.

CHUCK SCALES —Earlier in the

.year Scales. complained that he

wasn't a target in Pitt's passing of-
fense. Fine. That is true because of
the tremendous play of Williams
before he was injured in the third
game of the year.

But what about the last three
games? Chuck, Pitt isn't exactly
”Wide Receiver U.” They have been
looking for you lately. Where have
you been?

With five games remaining, you
can look for much of the same.

Pitt will continue to pass the ball,
Gladman will deteriorate on the
bench, and the Panther defense will
have another fourth quarter lapse, but
when bowl bids are extended, Pitt
will receive an invitation for the first
time since 1983.

Soccer runs in the Liberati family

By Greg Sysyn

Staff Writer

Dan Liberati, in Pitt coach Joe Lux-
bacher’s words, is ”the key to our
defense. He's been the main factor
the past two years. The strength of
our team is our defense, and he's
been right there anchoring it.”

To a big soccer fan this may not be
surprising. Liberati, a junior from
Springdale High in nearby Cheswick,
Pa., comes from a big soccer family.

His uncle, Paul Liberati, was All-
America here at Pitt in 1962. Another
uncle of his was NAIA All-America
at Alderson-Broaddus College. Don't
take anything away from Liberati,
though. According to Coach Lux-

area; he came from a soccer family.
But the main reason Dan is the player
he is — is himself.”

Liberati, a Regional All-America in
high school, turned down offers to
play at two nationally established
Division I soccer programs, Penn
State and Indiana, to come to Pitt.
”The offers from those two schools
weren't real good,” said Liberati.
”They didn't say I was going to get
a scholarship} but both wanted me to
join the team because of pride and
just walk on as a freshman. Joe [Lux-
bacher] was able to offer me a
package!’

Liberati, a two-year letterman at
defense, has been switched to a new
role on the Panther defense this year
and in Coach Luxbacher’s words he
has ”done the job.”

In the past two years he has been
a sweeperback, a type of ”free safe-
ty.” Now Liberati has been switched
to stopperback. Commenting on his
new position, he said, ”Your job is
to shut him [offensive player] down
 I like that. It's [a struggle between]
me and him, and I like to win all the
battles. I don't like to get beat [one-
on-one].”

Liberati’s goals are very unselfish
and team-oriented. ”l would like to
perform at my best every game, to
have fun and win,” he said. ”The
[team] goal this year is to make the
Big East playoffs and do well, and
who knows from there."

In a season where the Panthers are
performing well, Liberati still sees
room for improvement. ”Everyone’s
working hard but we can be better

 This is where we've got to dig deep

and pull down some wins,” added 1 . ,

Liberati.

Dan Liberati truly loves soccer. Ac-
cording to Coach Luxbacher, Liberati
”takes pride in being a player.” Lux-
bacher should know. Besides

coaching Dan during the collegiate-

soccer season, he plays alongside
him at the Beadling Soccer Club in
the Mt. Lebanon-Upper St. Clair area
during the off-season.

' Luxbacher describes Liberati as a
quiet leader. ”He leads more by ex-
ample than vocally,” said, Luxbacher.
”He consistently gives you a good
game.

”He is the type of player you want.
He's willing to listen and learn. Dan,
from a coach's point of view, is a
player who is here to play. ”

_We've been working out for almost
a month now, and our patience is
starting to run a bit thin. Whoever
makes the team will be happy, but

' the guys who don't will hurt for a

while. We'll see very shortly; I know
I can't wait.

Friday, Oct. 3 — Today, we had a
recruit from Texas come in and visit
the school. That was fun’ for me
because I'm from Houston, and I
don't see many Texans on campus
that often. We finished our suicides,
and I felt good afterwards. At first, I
didn't think that I could make it, but
now they are becoming a bit easier.
My endurance has improved tremen-
dously and I feel good. As of this
week, we should have shot 1,200

free throws, turning in the number
-that we made. I'm up to date, so I

“I feel numb. My friend Kim is dead and I've A
been trying to ﬁgure out how it could have

happened.

“I mean, Kim was perfect. Always the best
grades, very athletic, slim and pretty. ,
“And then something happened. Kim started
 losing a lot of weight. Oh, she was always
obsessed with gaining extra pounds, but this time

A )2 she just refused to eat.

“She got really defensive when Itold her she
 was too thin. I felt sick inside just watching her.
'   She weighed 70 pounds and looked like someone

don't have to shoot any until Mon-
day. We only have to run suicides
two more times, then we rest until the
15th. I'll be glad when we finish, but
at least I'll be in great shape. I'll also
be glad when Coach Evans makes his
final cuts. We've been at this for a
while, and it's been fun, but I want
to know one way‘ or the other. The
practices haven't interfered with my
studies, and that's good because I ’m
here for my education first. Coach
Evans has made it perfectly clear to
the team that school is the most im-
portant thing in a student-athlete's
life. He only has two team rules, and
they eliminate any doubts as to what
the team can and cannot do. First, be
on time, and be where you are sup-
posed to be. Second, don't do
anything that will hurt yourself, the
team or the school. '

To tell the truth, I expected a large

turnout for these tryouts — like the
tryouts for the football team — yet
there were many guys who could’ve
tried out but di_dn't. Although 12 is
a good-sized number, I expected at
least 20 or 25 guys. Well, it's almost
over, and I'll be glad when it is.

Monday, Oct. 6 — Today was the
next to last day that we would run
suicides. For some reason, the gym
was freezing, and guys were com-
plaining about the conditions. Never-
theless, we got through it, and after
Wednesday we'll be finished. I shot
my free throws, and all I have to do
is run, and I'll be done. The Pitt News
did an article on the team's pre-
season ranking, and most of the guys
were talking about it. I have exams
tomorrow and Wednesday, so I have
to study for them. I'll be ready for
them — and the suicides.
