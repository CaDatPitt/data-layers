Deans Welcome New Students
At Combined Assembly;
Senior Advisers Named

81 Fresliiiien Enroll

There may be gloom in Mud-
ville, but on the upper strata of
the Cathedral Vifednesday even-
ing there was much jubilation.

On the lips of many was the
name of J. G. Quick, University
registrar, and with the voicing of
the name went breathed wishes of
good hope, much happiness, and
many thanks.

The night janitorial force, had gath-
ered to discuss registration. By that
time, many students had ceased dis-
cussing the same topic ceased either
considering it a semi-annual ordeal
made less arduous than ever, or else
had given it up as a bad job entire-
ly. In the latter class were those
who had F’s, G's, and probations to
harry them.

But U. S. Grant, “Heiiiie,” and their
colleagues, for the ﬁrst time had
thought of registration with expres-
sions resembling billboard advertising
smiles.

The Pitt News had found it imprac-
tical to plant dictaphones among the
discussion groups, but through a bit
of careful eavesdropping had gathered
that less paper, trash, a.ud miscel-
laneous nuisances were to be found
on the seventh and eighth ﬂoors this
time than ever.

It’s all credited to a new plan of
the r”egi'strar. Congestion in the
scheduling department was reduced to
a minimum—in fact, practically elim-
inated.

On a stretch of blackboards in
Room 717, closed courses were listed
with the efficiency which marks the
workings of a stock market broker-
age. Students were permitted, for
the first time, to prepare their own
schedules without faculty supervision
or direction. No longer did freshmen
find themsedves pnshe.d.,_into_..phys—ed

of days on which they had no other

Dr. Spencer In Ofﬁce Here Since
Last September

From public school teacher to col-
lege president in 14 years spurts the
career of Dr. Herbert Spencer, dean

of the College. Last week his appoint-
ment as president of the Pennsylvania

the president of the PC-W’ board of
trustees. ‘

D2‘. Spencer assumed the post of

suine the presidency of PCW.

Dr_ John G. Bowman, Chancellor of
the University, said no plans had been
made for Dr. Spencer's successor.
Concerning the dean’s appointment he
added: “In recent years ‘ﬁve ._n_ien
have been taken from the University
as college presidents. Now Pennsyl-
vaniarcollege for Women takes Dr.
J-I-erbert L. Spencer, dean of the~Col-
lege, making the sixth. _The Penn.-
svlvania ‘College for Women has
chosen a good man. I am conﬁdent
of. his success and happy both to con-
gratulate Dr. Spencer on his oppor-
tunity and the College on the leader-
ship which he has assumed. Dr, Spen-
cer is, above all; kind and human. He
is an undiscourageable’ sortof man,
quick in decision and generally right.”

Graduating from Carnegie Tech in
1921, Dr. Spencer entered the public
school system as a teacher, in‘ 1 four
years ‘became vice principal of Lati-
mer Junior High school, leaving that
position to assume the leadership of
the Frick School. Dr. Spencer also

from the University. He is a mem-
ber of Delta Tau Delta, Phi Delta
Kappa, board of directors of the

Faculty Agrees 
On Organization;
Of New Council

Group Will Be Representative
And Advisory In Function;
Plans Incomplete 9

Although members of the faculties
of the University have generally ap-
proved the idea of organizing a Fac-
ulty Council, they have not reached
a decision on the details which such
a Council would involve, explained
Dr. 0. H. Blackwood, chairman ofrfa
special committee of the faculty, on
Wednesday. 5

Deans of the various schools coh-
curred. ‘:

Plans have been under considera-
tion for a special body of the faculty,
to be representative and advisory 
function, since August, acc rding to
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear. Tentative
proposals have been under considera-
tion since last February, he said. F

A plan presented at 2. special meet-
ing of the faculty of the College last
month suggested the election by the
faculty of representatives to the conic-

cil upon which the deans of 
various schools and the chancellor
would have representation. This

council would meet twice a seniester,
give advice on University policy, and
consider such important matters as
faculty tenure. Its function, accor:-
ing to McCready Huston, professor of
journalism, who issued a statement
for the faculty committee, would be
purely advisory.

The faculty of the College, accord-
ing to Dean Herbert L. Spencer.
unanimously approved the idea.

The faculty of the School of Educa-
tion approved the principle- of the
measure, at a later meeting, and sug-
gested revisions of the draft. Accord-
ing to Dean Charles E. Prall, mem-
bers of the School preferred postpone-
ment of the measure until the end of
the semester.

Dean E. A. Holbrook of the School
of Engineering stated that --his -f-acuity
“liked the idea and were glad to go
along with it.” He suggested that no
approximation of a deﬁnite outline for
the ‘body could be made.

The “entire faculty” of the School
of Business Administration has ap-
proved the council measure Jis it
stands. according to Montfort Jones,
acting dean of the School last semes-
ter. “Completely and unanimously,”
he said. v .

Members of the faculties empha-
sized that considerable time would be
I‘e€1uired to frame suitable machinery
for the council, if and when it is de-
cided upon.

Triai Nezvsrcel
Shown Before
Campus Group

Two hours of newsreel, at _a special
preview yesterday, gave a group of
students and faculty an idea of what
the recommended SFA campus news-
reel would look like.

The idea of a campus newsreel at
an admission fee of about ten cents
has been beforethe student govern-
ment groupfor some time, and Leon-
ard C. Marks, C35, chairman of SFA,
believes that it will soon be a regular
feature of campus life. Included in
the group.were Dr. Vincent W. Lan-

chased from any member of the coin-
mittee, from Miss Mary Milburn in

ceive its share of the proﬁts in pro-
portion to the number of tickets sold
by its representatives, Janet Savage,
Ed35, business manager, urges women
to purchase tickets from members of
their own class.

The class representatives are Lucy

more, Margaret Lewis, junior, and
Louise Birnkrant, senior, The cabinet
members of each class are included

Prom Plans 1

Advance

Joseph Rodgers, BA, chairman of
the Prom, has arranged most of the
“big-news” details of the annual for-
mal over the vacation period. Today

- he -announces the »-oiychestra, the ball-

room, and the price of tickets.
Tommie Cliristian’s orchestra, which
has done plenty of playing in its
time, comes here next Friday night to
the William Penn hotel main ball-

room.
The band takes time out from its
broadcasting activities, and says

good-bye to Chicago’s famous Trianon
ballroom, long enough to slip in four
hours of music for the semester's big
formal.

Featured with the orchestra will be
a male singing trio, the Three Jacks,
and a torcher who answers on and
off the air to the name of Blanche
Rochelle.

Among the places Cliristia.n’s men
have played are: -Palisades Park of
Jersey City (they were there for six
weeks); Denver’s Elitch gardens; St.

Louis’ Mounds country club (22
weeks) ; and various and sundry
prominent hotels, night clubs, and

restaurants. They did the RKO cir-
cuit for several years, a.nd much
broadcasting for NBC on national
hookups. Included in the lineup are
violinistsl, ﬂutists, bass-clariiiets and
chimes ringers.

Tickets for the Prom are now on
sale at $3 a couple. Witli the aid of
Miss hlary Milburn, secretary to the
dean of men, and of ﬁles from years
back, it has been determined by The
News that this will be the most inex-
pensive Junior Prom in modern his-
tory. Last year, tickets cost $3.50,
and, on back, prices ranged from $3.75
to $7.50.

Members of Rodgers’ committee
will be selling tickets on campus and
at all fraternity houses, from today
through next Friday. William
Daufenbach in Alumni hall, the office
of the dean of men, Room 801, Cathe-
dral, and Heinz House will also have
tickets on sale.

X-Ray Course Added

A new course, the application of
x-rays, will be offered this semester
by the physics department of the
School of Engineering. The course
will be taught by «Dr. Vincent ‘Hicks,
lecturer; in physics and physicist with
the_ Cooperative X-Ray laboratory of
the-University. It will be known as
Physics 32, and will give one credit.
If a sufficient number of students de-
sire"to take the course, a laboratory
period will be added.

Activity Points
Entirely Revised
By Men’s Group

Ten Points Permitted By Body;
Petitions For Excess
Due February 15

Women’s Scale Similar

\V'liolesale revision of the men ’s
activity point scale was an-
nounced yesterday by the men’s
point scale committee, headed by
Dr. Viiiceiit \V. Lanfcar, dean of
men.

The evaluation clianges, which
are the ﬁrst major ones in ﬁve years,
affect practically every activity on
campus. An innovation is the plan
of temporary points, whereby stu-
dents engaged in work requiring part
of a semester are listed for only the
dura.tion of their parti'cipat.ion.

Under the new rules, the students
receiving the greatest number of
points are: the editors and business
manager of The Pitt News, the pres-
ident of SFA, and, during the first
semester each year. the manager and
the captain of the football team. Each
receives eight points.

Cooperating with Miss Helen P.
Rush, assistant dean of women, and
the women's committee, the men’s
point scale body succeeded in equal-
izing the men’s and the women's scale
in all activities except clubs and 11011-
orary and professional fraternities.

Members of the men's group include
Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant dean of
men, Dr. Omar C. Held, of the Col-
lege, C. L. Van Sickle, of the School
of Business Administration, William
E. Brinker, of the School of Engineer-
ing, Theodore A. Siedle, of the School
of Education, and N. Robert Seidle,
secretary, assistant to the dean of
men.

According to Mr. Seidle, the
usual number of points permitted is
ten. All men carrying more than ten
are required to petition the commit-
tee for excess point-s. Petitions are
to be in Mr. Seidle’s office by Friday,
February 15.

Executive committee members of
SFA are given ﬁve points under the
new arrangement. The editors of the
Owl and the Panther and the track
manager each receive seven; asso-
ciate editors of The Pitt News get
six, as do the assistant football inan-
ager, the basketball manager, the
president of the YMCA, and the inan-
ager of the debating team. ’

Other students credited with ﬁve
points are: the editor of Dental Rays,
the presidents of the Dental Student
Council, the managing editor of the
Panther, the associate editor of the
Owl, the president of Interfraternity
Council, YMCA Executive committee
members, the managers of the band
and the orchestra, ‘and subordinate
managers of the football and track
squads. = .

Among the activities giving no
credit in one of the two semesters
are: track, cross-country, tennis, golf,
and, except for the manager, Cap and
Gown. - V-

Practical Experience And Less
Theoretical Study Urged

“The cliallenge of the next quarter
century is to produce teachers whose
training will consist less of theoretical
study and more of practical experi-
ence under actual class-room condi-
tions,” Dr. Walter A. Jessup, president
of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said last
Saturday in an address before 500
guests at the School of Education’s
25th anniversary luncheon in the ball-
room of Hotel Schenley.

Other speakers at the luncheon
were Dr. J. Freeman Guy, ﬁrst asso-
ciate superintendent of Pittsburgh
public schools, toastmaster; Dr. John
G. Bowman, chancellor of the Univer-
sity; Dr. Anthony M. Goldberger, pro-
fessor of education and former acting
dean of ‘the’ School; Dr. Charles R.
Foster, member of the ﬁrst graduating
class; and Dr. J. C. Werner, president
of’ the vA1umni Association of the
School of Education.

A 20-page brochure distributed to
the guests includes quotations from
the ﬁrst announcement of the School
of Educationin the “Annual Cata-
logue” for the University's 90th year,
a chart showing the increase in higher
degrees in education granted by the
School since its founding in 1910, and
-a general account of the history and
development of the School since its
founding.

DESPITE THE AC'l‘ION of the I

United States Senate in voting
against American adherence to
the l\'orld Court on the grounds
that mcmbersliip might. involve
us in European politics, we are
already involved.

When the United States loaned
its ﬁrst dollar abroad and when
American investors bought a
share in their first overseas ba-
nana stalk, the United States en-
tered world politics.

Thereafter, the economies and
commerces of Europe, as well as
those of backward territories,
have become our concern. In 1935
we are a ﬁrst-rate world empire,
slightly curled at the edges as a
result of the prolonged slump in
foreign trade.

VVe became a part of entang-
ling European systems in 1917,
although V\7oodrow VVilso11 had
“kept us out of war,” partly be-
cause of the steel and shells of
Pittsburgli. V/Ve are a part of
every major European imbroglio

for similar and more contempor-

ary reasons.

This week, for example, it is ex-
pected that the Supreme Court
will defer its pronouncement on
the gold clause dispute to another
afternoon than Tuesday, a legal
holiday, when toreign traders
might take advantage of the
“break” in the money market to
the disadvantage of American
traders. VVe do nothave isola-
tion, and we cannot have it even
though Hiram Johnson were per-
sonally to cut all the transatlantic
cables.

 

ONLY A TECHNOLOGICAL differ-
ence seems to separate the pre-war
and post-war military agreements of
France and Great Britain. In 1914
Great Britain and France had a “de-
fensive” alliance on land and at sea.
In 1935 the two countries have just

One reason why there was a. war in
Europe in 1914 was because English
and French foreign ministers had
pledged their peoples so neatly.

 

A. A, MII.«\’F.‘. is something other
than whimsical when he suggests, in
“Peace with II-Ionor,” that the way to
‘have peace is to deﬁne war as a great-

Hints For Profs
With Mailed Bids 
For ‘Heart Hop’

By Alan C. Lloyd 

Heart Hop! What a name! Andf
yet it signiﬁes the first time Univer-5
Sity women have listened to reasoni
for years. Of course I cannot say just 
whose reason they listened to. but:
they changed their mind at leastﬁ
once, so .

All tllkli requires explanation. The
whole aﬁ’air started with a decision to 
hold a cl:-znce in honor of the several i
treasuries of the womenfs classes}

i

‘The next. point to be considered was 5

women shouldf
and here realf
hard to

whether the men or
pay for the tickets,
trouble started. It would be
hold a “University \\'c-men's Dance”
and sell tickets to men. The implica-
tion was too strong. And then there
was a little matter of three dollars,
for the Junior Prom coming for the
next weekend for the men. So the
women made the supreme sacriﬁce.
It was a matter of the men’s purchase
with no purchasers, or the women’s
purchase with a. probable prom ticket
in return. So the women buy, and
claim the right to name the dance.
At ﬁrst Ye McLaughlin wanted to
name it the “Sweetheart Dance,” but
others, more reticent in their inten-
tions, tampered the name to “Heart
Hop." Fo—give me, my Fran.
=14 4: #1

Dear faculty members:

This section might be entitled,
“How not to buy a Heart Hop ticket,”
and I propose to give you all the
devices that have been reported to
me on the subject. I realize that ever
since you got the letter and the en-
closed tickets that were sent to all
faculty members, asking you to sup-

port the women‘s dance, you have
been perturbed. This is doubtless an
evil factor on our grades, and for

that reason I wish I had been able to
suggest the following at an earlier op-
portunity.

The suggestions: 01’ these the
most. feasible is to enclose the tickets
in the same envelope, and give them
to your se.c1‘etary. Then when the
gii-l—she’ll probably be one of ‘those
pretty fresliman girls you’ve heard
about—calls_. the secretary acts natur-
ally deaf and dumb and returns the
letter and the ticket.

The next best is to not receive the
letter until the girl calls. “Oh, let me
see,” you stammer, “I put that some-
where. I’m sorry that I don't dance
myself. If I can ﬁnd that letter, I’ll
send it to you.” Then you get her name
and add, “If I don’t find it, I'll pay
you for the tickets.” That will be a.
salve on your conscience and cheer
her up a little, and you hope she
doesn’t see the letter in your coat
pocket. I'd better‘ warn you——don’t
leave the_ letter on your desk. The
kid might see it.

In case you don't have a secretary,
your problem is more difﬁcult, and,
you should be cautioned, you might
lose considerable prestige if you re-
fuse one of your own students—For
women’s rushing week is’. soon here,
and women must talk during all those
teas! And then you will be in for,
“Oh———him. That cheap lab assistant,”
or perhaps instead, “R.ea11y,'he‘ is‘ only
a graduate assistant. Not even an MA
yet!” Then what will your reputa-
tion be? , ‘ ‘

Another caution-—don’l: let the head
of your department know you're not
going. He probably is, himself, and
he might take your excuse if you have
a good one. Otherwise he might de-
cide that you are not interested in
the school.

Come to think of it, no one has told
me quite what to do in the case of the
faculty member without the secretary,
except either to refuse ﬂatly_ insult
the girl, or resign, on the one hand,
or to buy a ticket on the other.

‘Bring On Those Dukes!’
   CryiMid-Semester Vacationfnelayers Make Grade;

 

Trackmen Enter West Virginia Indoor Relay Event;
Swimmers Travel To Columbus For Meet

—__..

An old Panther basketball jinx pre-E
sents itself once more tonight when:
Chick Davies brings his fast-stepping‘
Dukes and their string of 24 consecu-'

tive victories to the stadium to at-
tempt to add one more victory to the
string and clinch the city title at 1.119
same time when they meet Dr. Carl-
son's hard luck Panther team.

Aifter the tlefezit handed them
the Panthers last year the
startin;_{ winning basketfoall
and re yet to be stopped.
this S:‘a.<.Ol‘. the Duquesne
chalked up 14 sti-aiglit wins
added to the ten last year, totals up
to 24 games in which the Dukes have
not tasted defeat. Acid this to the
fan that the Panthers have won. but
one gani:-. in six from the Dukes and
that most oi‘ these games have been
won by one or two points, and it will
be an indication of what to exile-Ct "1
tonight's game.

For Duquesne, Coach Davies

‘.’,‘Zlill€‘:~3

ﬁve has

will

probably stick to the same startin.’-ii

lineup that defeated the Panthers, 2"-
25, a month ago. Captain Paul Birch
is the only player who has faced the
Panthers   varsity man 111 more
than one game, the remaining four
2la:.’e1‘s being either last year's re-
serves or new men. Birch and VValt
Miller, sophomore star, will pair at
the forwards, big Ed Kwelier will be
at the pivot post, and Frank Serany

and Jimmy Murphy, diminutive

guards, will take care of the back

court posts. _
Like Davies, Coach. Carlson will

also send the same starting lineup,

against the Dukes that lined up in the
ﬁrst Pitt-Duke game. Skippy Hughes

and Ted Roderick will be the for-,

wards, High Pete Noon takes the
center post, and Claire Cribbs and
Ross Emrick are set for the guard po-
sitions.

In a preliminary to the varsity bat-;

tie, the Panther Cubs take the floor
against the Duke fresh, in an attempt
to gain revenge for the defeat the lit-
tle Panthers received from the Dukes
in their last meeting. The freshman
game will start at 7 o’clock with the
varsity ganie beginning at 8:15.
Traokmen Go To Morgantown

Tomorrow morning Coach Carl
Olson's Panther track team will de-
part for Morgantown, VVe-st Virginia,
where the sprinters, distance men,
hurdlers, and weight men will vie for
honors in the annual Mountaineer in-
door relays.

Coach Olson has had his men prac-
ticing daily during the past week, in
order to have his team in top form for
the first important indoor event on
the schedule. He plans to enter men
in the varsity, AAU, and freshman
events.

Following this meet, the trackmen
will be idle until the following Sat-
urday at which time the "annual in-
door University track and ﬁeld cham-
pionships will be held at the track

house. Entry blanks will be availa-
ble in next Z‘.’IOIlda3-"S issue of the
News. ,

Those probably making the trip in-
clude:

Varsity: Captain Kigor, Fleming, Menaker,
Schlossberg, Lasky, McMunn. Wagenhouser,
Kirkpatrick. Albright, Musico, Tost, Groat,
Connolly, McDonald. Leggin, Good, Sowiski,
Blair, Gerrety, Robinson, Pelucha, Johnson,

and Avizienis.

Freshmen: Thomas, Coffee, Brown, Siefers,
Baran, Mason. Swift, Turchik, McConnell,

Freshmen, Transfers To Receive
Fraternity Rushing Rules
At Noon Meetings Today

 

[Discussion groups for freshmen oni

fraternities have supplanted the for-
mer Panhcllenic freshman education
usseinbly. The purpose is to prepare
second semester freshmen and trans-
i‘<_-i'.=, for women's fraternity rushing
which begins February 21 and con-
tinues to February 23. The groups
will meet today at 12:30 oclock lll
Alumni hail 111 Rooms 101, 102, 104,
105, 106, 109, 110, 111, and 113.

The leader for each individual group
is an outstanding fraternity woman.
They are Muriel Dils, Ed3:.n, LOIS

Milliken, C35, Agnes Calabrese, Ed35,§

Helen Milliron, C35, Marguerite Mc-

(lloskey, C35, Marcella. Leyton, C37,’

Marguerite Swank, C35, Janet Savage,
C35, and Margaret Chalmers, Ed36.
Throucjli them, the non-fraternity

women will receive complete instruc-'

tions concerning rushing invitations
and their replies, the ethics of rush-
ing, the etiquette to be observed at
the rushing parties, and the instruc-
tions concerning the answering of
Saturday invitations, and the marking
of the preferential ballot. After the
(liS(:llSSlOIl, “-0 Philos," the frater-
nity handbook, will be distributed.

I-‘raternities are not considered as
something separate and mysterious on
the campus, but as an integral part of
the University. Orientation for fresh-
men is needed in regard to the frater-
nal system, according to the oﬁicia
Panhellenic handbook.

Although all second semester fresh-

"men and transfers were notiﬁed by

the Panhelleiiic freshman education
committee, under the chairman-
ship of Margaret Chalmers, all non-
fraternity women are also invited to
attend a group today.
