"SI-IARLI. WE HAVE MAR.TlZAL_LAW?.

“: The burning problem before the students is undubitably
:that'of"military training and the _questions that are clustered
about this, new phase of University life.

‘ In the lastanalysis, the cardinal points at issue in the
{ftroversy are to be found in four main propositions :, . ‘
' J J 1. Shall theiuniforms be accepted? ' V _,

V 2. Shall there be guard duty, particularly by freshmen?

 ' 3. Must men who take drill be compelled to take physical
‘._education‘as well? " . ' - ._ _ ‘
c   4._,:Is the University to be "placed under martial law?’ ‘
L"?  Out of ‘these pointsof issue has evolved a grave situation of
.V_mfob ;activit’y.. Last Thursday the freshmen company was given
’the-. ﬁrst V~tria“l at guard duty. They were immediatelyrun off

‘heycampus by. a oup, of upper cla.s‘smen.* The’ matter then

P.. - f . c. .

'  7’?The ﬁ_rst'q11estion‘ is no longer debatable.‘ The;obj.ectio‘n to
_.t-hefuniforms is about three months too late. ‘When the students
- returned to school this fall, it was with the express understand-
-_‘__1'V-ng. that drill would be compulsory. Furtheiﬁwhen the men reg-
. istered it -was fully and completely understood that each man
I Was to purchase- a uniform._ ‘To object to the uniforms now" is
. outfof the question. . . ' V’ . _ ‘

~ The next proposition of ‘guard mount seems entirely plaus-

._“ible. If Pittis to have military training let ushave a real course.

Guard duty is one of the most important phases pf military work
nd.§.it*is as necessary. to learn how to stand guard‘ as it is to
‘miliarize oneself -with the- manual ‘of arms. To remove-the

 pauses of friction from this standpoint‘ it is only ‘necessary for
‘*tliV‘e Student Senate to declare ‘the freshmen rules non-operative
""(,i7llI'lng the time the men are on guard duty. or_ to have Dean
*Mel’lor place only upper classmen on guard. The former seems
V  V" Objections of the students‘to taking both military training
“and physical education seems to be well taken. It is obviously
 unfair to ask a man to spendﬁvehours a week at’drill plus three
_hours* a Week in physical education and -on some gweeksito be
 .Vforc‘.ed to stand guard‘ for‘ eight hours, making at times .a total °of
sixteen hours’ work in the" University, in addition to his school
Vyvork. This is particularly hard on those men who are self-s’up-
_fpV_o_I‘t.ing-or partly so or those who are carrying a heavy schedule.
 ‘Something should certainly be "done to alleviate this condition.
_ The University ruling calls for live hours of military drill a week,
 as the. matter stands that requirement is almost doubled.

‘  This, however, is a matter that can easily be adjusted. ‘ .
'0 . The great question is whether or not there should be martial

_1awg. It does not seem to us that this is a time or occasion to turn
I-Pitt "into an’ armed camp or to place the students entirely- under
finilitary rule. - The students of the University have never been

V-_-‘placed in such an atmosphere and we are not yet ready for such-

V. a; move and an attempt to force such a ruling on the student
_ .body_ would mean no end of diﬂiculty. Even in schools where
“there was military training before such a ruling was not insti-

 ‘-tuted‘and. most certainly should 11ot bemade eﬁective here where
,1 the men are unaccustomed to any military discipline.

‘V.

The consensus of student opinion seems -to be: ‘Give us a

 real military course whose jurisdiction is operative only during
 the "period of actual duty. and we Pitt men will accept it with
~‘ ‘ fwillingness. . This is undoubtedly true. The more stable minded,

fairer thinking men will eventually supersede the radicals of
.f the I_. W.‘. W. typegn student. leadership and conditions will re-
sume their normal and stable equilibrium. ’

The lads from across the hollow
showed a good offense, making two

Another Mohican ' l

Captain Cliﬁ Cal-lson’s record is
unbroken. He has functioned in _
every _varsity football contest since '
he entered Pitt. His injury in the
w. & J. game would have bi-oken
the spell for a less '..trepid man
than Carlson. Despite all protest
he left his bed in St. Margaret's
Hospital and came to Forbes Field
Saturday. He donned a suit and
took his old place, for a few mo-
meuts, during-the fourth period and’
-then was again rushed back to his
bed in the hospital.. Capt. Carlson
is the only'man on the Pitt squad
with.four years regular work to his ,
credit and he will be the last man
to achieve that goal for the one
year rule .for Freshman will pro-
hibit a repetition‘ of the accomplish-
ment.

of the Carnegie Tech team. Frank
McKean, an old VV. & J. player, is
one of the mainstays in the prospec-
tive line of the soldiers. One of the
best known men of the squad from
a local standpoint is Frank Johovics,
who played such a stellar game for
the Indiana Normal team last year.

The plan is very simple. The Alumni ‘will be askedto take out life insurance policies, naming Pitt as

ENGINEERS To ’
GRADUATE EARLY

Requests from manufacturing con-
cerns inquiring if the University

early resulted in that question being
the important discussion at the fac-
ulty meeting held in 203 Thaw Hall,
Thursday, October 23, 1917. Over
one-half of the 1918 class of engineers
enlisted last spring and summer in
the 15th U. S. Engineering Corps, the
Pitt Base Hospital Unit, or the Naval
-Coast Defense. This fall many others
entered the Government war service
through honorable conscription. An
example of how hard the war has. af-
fected the Engineering Senior enroll-
mentis shown in the Department of
Electrical Engineering, where last
spring before the declaration of war
there were twelve regular enrolled
juniors at the opening of school. This
fall the number was‘ reduced to
three. Other "departments were

equally affected except the Civil En-

gineering De-partment, which only
lost three members. ‘

All members of the faculty agreed
that it would be :a great mistake if
the courses were shortened in so
much as to mar the technical training
which Pitt engineers have received in
the -past. It would not only lower the
reputation of the school, but it would
be an injustice to the student and to
his -country. Our country will live
long after the war. After the war,
trained young men will «be required
to take the places of the older men
just as they have in the past and at
the present. The cataclysm of war
must not disarrange or disorganize
the quality of training that our en-
gineering students should receive. ’No
matter how urgently technical men
are needed either in government serv-
ice or by the industries, it would be
utter -folly-to graduate men three-
fourths educated. _

The «faculty voted favorably to the
motion that the Senior Engineers
would be graduated April 1, 1918, pro-
vided they did intensive work and
used their Thanksgiving and Christ-
mas vacations for thesis work.-~ In ad-
dition to the present subjects, carried

quired in the near future to select a
thesis subject, preferably one of a
military nature. They ‘must have
their subject in such form so that all
laboratory or experimental work may
be done during the Thanksgiving and

Social Science ‘and "Interna-

A campaign for members of the

Social Science and the International
Polity Clubs -was launched at the joint
session of the two clubs yesterday.
The plan is that each member of the
club shall endeavor to get ‘one or
more new members. The membership
of both clubs this year has been
larger than in the past.
Both clubs are organizations for
the purpose of creating-interest in the
discussion of the current topics of the
