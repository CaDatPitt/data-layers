Contrary to downtown newspaper reports that

Chancellor John G. Bowman was

planning to retire,

in an interview yesterday, Dr. Bowman revealed that

no such issue had arisen during
board meeting. '
A Local newspapers carried

a recent informal

a sensational story

yesterday stating that the Chancellor was planning
to resign and that he had requested the board to
name Provost Rufus H. Fitzgerald as his successor.
According to Dr. Bowman, he convened the sud-
den, informal meeting of the board, because he

Because today, at 12:30, the Pitt student body is going to. turn out at the
Bigelow Boulevard plaza and give their team, their players and their coach,

been shown or ever will Vibe shown.

Your famous blue-coated Pitt Band will be there, giving out with your school

It’s Fight vs. Fame Tomorrow

We"re Determined--Zelenski
By ALEX ZELENSKI Sports Editor
There may have been better balanced
Pitt teams, there may have been greater

Pitt teams, and there may have been bet-
ter material on the practice ﬁelds at Pitt,
but never has there been a team with
more ﬁght, more determination than the
team that will take the ﬁeld tomorrow
afternoon against the undefeated Duke
university eleven.

Even though their record Shows 3 blots out of
three consecutive games, and even though they are
commonly called the “scoreless wonders,” “claw—
less Panthers,” et al, the Pitt gridders emerged
from the Minnesota game not only with a 39-0
blot on their record, but with the conﬁdence based
upon the fact that they had outrushed, and scored
more ﬁrst downs than did the mighty Gophers from
Minnesota. .

But We’re Undefeated--Parker
By MARTIN PARKER Sports Editor, Duke Chronicle

Durham, N. C., Oct. 21———With four vic-
tories already behind them, the undefeated
Duke Blue Devils prepared this week to roll
on to Pittsburgh with the intention of throt-
tling the Pennsylvania eleven in the sixth
meeting between the two schools.

Though no longer feared here on the Methodist
Flats as in past seasons, the Panther team is still
regarded as a formidable opponent and one which
is capable of being very much “on” when the
Devils face it Saturday afternoon.

With this in mind, Coach Wallace Wade has
been driving his charges hard this week. Several
star performers, among them guard Tom Burns,
end Luther Dempsey, ‘and halfback Moffat Storer,
‘received rough treatment in the battle with Col-
gate, but they are expected to be in condition
by Saturday, with the possible. exception of

And so Dr. Hazard made the
point: that Pittsburgh was a city
of the future, having not yet ful-
ly explored the possibilities of its
people. The native-born Pitts-
burgher can help create the Pitts-
burgh of tomorrow by attempting
to understand the process of as-
similation that the _ immigrant
has to go through to become an
American. It will take at least
another generation until the as-
similation has been corupleted——

The American Service institute,
is an organization that deserves
the support and interest of college
students. Learning about the work
they are doing in this community
is a vital part of a college stu-
dent's education.

Tom Loftin Johnson, ﬁrst prize
winner, was born in Denver in
1900. His father was a cousin of
the famous Tom L. Johnson, the
great social reformer who was
mayor of Cleveland from 1901_to
1909, who has been an ‘inspiration
for much of the work the artist
has done. 0

“American Pieta" is the ﬁrst of
his paintings to be shown in a na-
tional exhibition, and is done in a
manner reminiscent of the Chris-
tian Pietas, which showed the cut-
ting down from the cross and car-
rying off of the body of Christ
after his cruciﬁxion.

Band Plans Formations
I%rﬂMmmmw%Ghme

BY ROBERT LANDSEADEL

The Pitt band of 120 marching
men will maneuver through its
most intricate and difficult forma-
tion of the year when the Gold and
Blue meet the Blue-Devils of Duke
university at the stadium tomor-
row afternoon.

In I. meeting confined to the
band room by weather conditions
last week, Lieutenant Ramon C.
Dougan, -drillmaster, announced
to bandsmen that the formations
this year are growing gradually
more difficult and that the Dulce
game formation is the most;com-
plicated. of the year.

With the customary heralilingz
trumpet fanfare the band will
swiftly move onto the field and
-will immediately step off into a
replica of the direction symbol
often found on maps. An arrow
pointing north and lines to repre-
sent east, northeast, etc., will be
formed. A

Above the arrow will be a huge
N of 30 men to represent north,
and below the symbol a similar
letter S to represent south. While

the N and upper portion of the
direction symbol remain silent,
the remainder of the band? will
pay a tribute to the North by
playing “Yankee Doodle," and as
the S and lower part of the arrow
stand at attention, the South will
be honored by a few strains of
“Dixie." Next, the two songs will
be played simultaneously, which,
believe it or not, can be done.
Other songs will be the popular
Pitt Band signature, “The Thun-
dorer,” the Duke school song,
“Blue. and White,"

of “Your Land and My Land."

The present war has opened
the door to many strange occupa-
tions for women over the world.
British women, in particular, have
become street—car drivers, fire
fighters, policewomen, etc. Re-
cently a new field was introduced.
British women from all walks of
life — teachers, typists, clooks,
hairdressers, mannequins —— have
joined forces to make up the
Women’s Land Army.

This army was,’ organized to
meet some of the increased labor
lt aims to

the

needs in agriculture.
reduce the man-power on

farms of England.

Officials demand that each rec-
ruit bephysically and tempera-
mentally suitable, so that there
will be as few failures as possible.
,Since -the girls have to do the
numerous farm ‘tasks, it is 
portant that they be healthy and
strong. And since they make less
money than the girls in other
branches of service and have less
chance for advancement, it is im-
portant that they like farm life
and “farm work. , _  _ 

Recruits, or’ ivoluntleersi  as
they are called, get three months
training ei~t_her on selected farms

‘ or in‘ some agricultural college..

In the former case, the girl is
taught by the farmer; in the lat-
ter, she attends lectures and de-
monstrations. Actually only one
out of every three applicants is
accepted.

in England

While in training the girls are
paid by the Land Army, but as
soon as the training is over the
farmer takes over the payments.
The size of her payinaturally de-
pends upon the individual farmer
from then on; but it is never very
high.

After the training period the

girls are'assigned to general farm
work. Later they may get into
more specialized jobs if they so
desire.

Volunteers are now employed
in every branch of farming and
land work. Some of these girls
wantto continue this type of work

"even after the war is over. Their

tasks include: dairying, care of
stock, hedging, ditching, forestry,
shepherding, and even tractor-
driving. Several land-girls have
proved so efficient that they have
been sent out as instructors.

A. local welfare
visits each new girl when
enters a community, and helps
her to get acquainted. They hold
parties and rallies; and will aid
any land-girl in case of illness
or trouble.‘ K

~- .. There are» more thalili 14,000

Land-Army members’ in perma-
nent jobs. . ,But even more are
needed. Registration is now com-
pulsory, but few of the girls are
really suited for the work.

At any rate, the Land Army is
a success. And it is now "two
women” at home to keep “one
man at the front."

are preferred as speakers at these
assemblies.

According to chairman William
Seyler, C42,i:’the type of speaker
that Pitt Town Meeting prefers
is the one who can stimulate his
audiences and make them think
as he does.

Stated Seyler, “One quality of a
good speaker is the ability to
arouse the interest of the audi-

fence.”

A good address, he declared,
should have educational value and

.also be entertaining‘. Seyler said

it was general opinion that a dra-
matic speaker is more interesting
than one who gives only a large
number of statistics. As an exam-
ple of a dramatic speaker with a
command-.of his factual material,
he suggested Dr. Bernard C.
Clausen.

“Of course,” said Seyler, “dra-
matics alone will not put it over;
the speaker must really -have
something to say.”

Another decision established by

the survey was that the speaker

must be respected byhis audience.
and must have a thorough knowl-
edge of his subject.

And as soon as the plumber

will be turned on throughout the

In the meantime, if you find
it inconvenient to carry a chart
of these floors in your hatband,
just walk up to any Cathedral

and wait.

lf you get no water, drop your

A quota "of $2700 has been
set.
Mr. Biddle stated, “This year

the goal is two fold—we not only

want a contribution from each,

student, but also desire the

amount to zbe at least $1.50.”.

Quick Heads Drive
Heading the faculty drive which

i is now in its ﬁfth day of progress
<1 is John G. Quick, University reg-

istrar.. The faculty goal is $7,300.

Thei United Fund drive has three
main objectives, according to Mr.
Quick: “First, to aid all agencies

which heretofore came under the

auspices of the Community Fund;
second, to contribute our share to
the Red Cross Emergency War
Relief; and third, to help the Unit-
ed Service organization, which is
an extremely worthy cause.”

Past Figures .

An impetus to the present fac-
ulty campaign is the worthy rec-
ord of the past faculty campaigns.
The following ﬁgures have been
distributed to the faculty mem-

OJUWNI-'0-l

On many of the defense projects encountered by the Béll
System, the work sheets——show.ing telephone facilities '
needed and time allowed—-wouldimiake a good, conservative

engineer’s hair stand on end.

For example, take the Navy’s huge new air base near
Corpus Christi, Texas, which covers 14,500 acres, includes 29
separate flying fields and 481 buildings. Closely connected
with the base are Defense Housing projects for 1700 families.

Imagine the complex problems involved in planning tele-
phone facilities for this new “city” where formerly there
were sand dunes—in obtaining and installing miles and miles
of wire and cable, switchboards, telephones by the thousand.

But telephone engineers and construction men took hold
—proceeded to shatter records-—completed their huge task
in seemingly impossible time. For men with the "will to
do,” there’s a real thrill in such Bell Syglem work!

The concensus of opinion down
here in Tobaccoland is that Duke
this year has one of its finest
teams in a decade of strong elev-
ens under Wallace Wade. The

‘ quarter of victoriesalready chalk-

ed up‘ bear this out.

- Wake ‘Forest was routed in the
season’: opener, 43-14. The fol-‘

lowing Saturday revenge for pre-
vious defeats was meted out to
the i nvnding Volunteers

far the toughest battle the Dukes
have been in this season,
then lead early in the game, then
be tied, lead once more, then

cially commendable has been the

too weak at the guards. It has

iolsonmen lnvade Cleveland

IN VINCENT QUATRIII

With their liniment, track shoes
and will to win packed, Coach Carl
Olson's Blue and Gold cross coun-
try aggregation will make their
lirst foreign invasion when they
roll into Cleveland tomorrow to
take on Case, Bethany and Hiram
in a quadrangular meet in an
attempt to rebound from the
Michigan State setback suifered
last week.

‘Rockefeller Parlr's four mile
course, situated near Case, will
be the scene of battle for these
four college spikers. Of this
threesome that the Panthers will
cope with tomorrow, only one
school, Bethany. will be familiar
to the local thinclade. Four years
ago the Olsonrnen matched
strides ‘with the boys from We ':
Virginia and the locals caine out
on top.

The Blue and Gold barriers will
be going on a some sort of “blind
date” when they meet their foes
in Cleveland. Not a single clue
is held by the Pitt board of strat-
egy as to the calibre of the Case,
Bethany and Hiram teams. Coach
Olson opines, however, with Coach
Sharer of Case, Boettcher of
Bethany and Mathews of Hiram
at the helms of these cross coun-
try forces, the reception will be
'pretty hot.”

With. the showing that the Pan-
thers made in their fracas with
Michigan State, “King Carl” has
bought himself a pair of rose col-
ored glasses for the meet tomor-
row. “Barring weather condi-
tions, Pitt should finish no lower
than second,” said Coach Olson.
“However, don’t get me wrong,”
he added, “we won’t be satisﬁed
with second and we'll be out there

trying to bring home the bacon.”
The experience nm the 01......

ference to their timing and peg.
iﬁl. should put the local harriers
in top form to tackle the enemy.
Last week’: affair was the initial
contest for the local speedsters
‘_3d,’~l|¢7 Were up against the na-
tions best. Thus, many valuable
tips were picked up.

_ According to present plans,
eight boys will make the trip. They
will be headed by sophomore Bill
Curtis, No. 1 man. In the sec-
ond slot. will be either Marcus Al-
lias or Captain John Brosky, who
have been waging a battle for that
post that is closer than a vest is
to a shirt. Bob Davis will run
fourth and Jim Saunders ﬁfth. In
trials held Tuesday evening among
Bob Graham, Joe Carr, Bob Scott,
Ben Foote and William Miller to
determine who should represent
Pitt in sixth and seventh place,
Bob Graham and Joe Carr respec-
tively emerged victorious.

Stebbins spurns
Pro Grid Ollcr

Harold “Curly” Stebbins today
rejected an offer to play “pro”
football with the Pittsburgh Steel-

ers, so that he can remain as as-'

sistant coach at the University
of Pittsburgh.

Stebbins was a former halfback
at Pitt and is best remembered as
a member of the 1938 “dream

coaching duties at the University,
Stebbins has a job with a local

Meet

PiKA Team Trounces Delts, 26 - 0;
Phi Delts Extended By Theta Chi

Doing what everybody expected
them to do, the AE&ME seniors
overpowered the Civil engineers
"B” team, 20-0, last Monday after-
noon. Dave Mamaux, “Mad Mar-
shall” Winkler, “Dusty” Rhodes
and Co. were just too much for
their opponents as they chalked up
an easy victory.

Not to be outdone
senior brethren, the

by their
AE&ME

freshmen and sophomores defeat-.

ed the Electrical engineers‘, 14-0,
3. little later the same day.

On Tuesday the fraternities got
going and provided plenty of en-
tertainment as eight houses saw
action in four games. ’

The Phi Kaps, last year’s run-
ners-up in the Greek circuit,
started off on the right foot by
trouncing Sigma Chi, 15-0.
"Chuck” Cusick, holdiilg down one
of the end posts for the Phi. Kaps,
was the whole show as he scored
all 15 points for his team.

The gene between the Delts
and PiKA provided one of the
surprises of the day as Gus and
Ralph Wilde-led the PiKA’s to a
26-0 triumph. The Wildea were
in every scoring play but "one as
they helped their team to this
surprisingly decisive win.

The closest game of the day
was the contest between Theta
Chi and the Phi Delts, with the
latter winning, 8-6. The margin

of victory came on a safety scored
by “Whitey” Carlson.

The ﬁnal game of the day found
the Phi Gams, defending title
holders, beating the Pi Lams, 18-0,
in a dull game. Kenny Grossett
scored twice for the Fijis, once on
a pass from Bill Calvin and once
on an interception of a Pi Lam
aerial. Colvin accounted for the
other Fiji tally on a pass from
Jim Warne. None of the attempt-
ed conversions materialized.

All of the fraternity lsouees
saw action in the badminton
league Tuesday. Sigma Alpha
Mn, defending champions, heat
the SAE’s, 3-0. Norman -Sapol-
sky and “Haclc"' White _were-the
winning due for the Sarnmies.
The Phi Eps, with Cuddy Zris-
kin and Bob Brody performing,
-beat Lambda Chi Alpha, 3-0.
Shephard and Eckhardt of the
Phi Gams, bested Kramer and
Runk of the PiKA’s, 2-1.
The Pi Lams beat the Delts,
3-0, while Sigma Chi and Theta

Chi forfeited to the Phi Delis and
the Phi Kaps.

Mr. James Potts, intramural cl-
rector, wants all the teams el-
rolled in the intramural leagues
now to understand the setup as

far as forfeits go. Two forfeits -'

in the same sport automatically
eliminates the team from further
competition in that sport.

Written by Dr. Gilmore, the
brochure is profusely illustrated
with pictures of law students and
members of the School of Law fac-
ulty. It traces the history of the
law school and shows how much
inﬂuence lawyers have had upon
the University itself.

Listed in the brochure are the
standards of the school, courses,
requirements for a cl m i s s i o n ,
honors which may be attained,

The adjustment in the curricu-
lum due to the War is explained.
Quarter terms have been substitut-
ed for the semester courses which
were formerly given.

More than 4,000 copies of the
brochure have been sent to alumni
of the School of Law, to members
of the Pennsylvania bar, to judges,
and to college seniors who have
expressed a desire to be acquaint-
ed with the facilities offered.

“The brochure may have been
an influence in preventing a larg-
er drop in enrollment than the
comparably small 20 per cent
drop which occurred this fall,”
declared Dr. Gilmore.

Other universities had 35 to 40
per cent declines in registration.
