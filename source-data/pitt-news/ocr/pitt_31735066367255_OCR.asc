Henry Cabot Lodge, Republican candidate for vice-pres-

“We need the ablest to do this,” Lodge said, “and we

Political Groups
Step  A_cti*vities,
For Final Weeks
By Marlene Stern
With’ the presidential election

only a few weeks away, the two

political groups, on campus, Stu-
dents for Kennedy and Youth for
Nixon, are speeding up their ac-
tivities. ‘

Commissioner, John J. Mc-
Clellan and David Sussman have
both spoken during the past week
to the students for Kennedy.

Besides the Soap Box for Ken-
nedy being active, the students at
the University in, conjunction
with the students at Chatham,
Carnegie Institute of Technology
and Duquesne have been cam-"
paigning in the. area recently to
promote interests in the Demo-
cratic candidate.

Faculty members of the Uni-
versity have expressed the opin-
ion, that this is the most enthu-
siastic welcome that any presi-
dential cagndidatel has received in
ﬁfteen years, including Franklin
D. Roosevelt.

" The Youth for Nixon-Lodge
students are canvassing through
the Braddock‘ area to promote in-
terest in their candidate. '

I The movie‘ “Ambassador for-
Peace” will be shown by these
students on Oct. 24 at noon and
again at -12:30 inthe SU Lounge.
This movie contains details of the

Gthink we are doing this when we

submit Richard.‘ Nixon for Presi-

- dent of the United States.”
At the Midday Series last Fri-»

day Lodge emphasized, “No one
is going to take over the world
or the iU.S.,,and we are solid in
that fact. Communist Russia is
strong, and we must be strong in
every sense of the word in order
to stand upto them.”
Islands Will Be Defended
In reply to a student’s question
astto why we are keeping the
world guessing concerning the is-
lands of Quemoy and Matsu,
Lodge said, “I think the world
knows what our motives are;
these islands know we will de-
fend them.” L
One student questioned how
the United States’ prestige could
keep Red China out of the Unit-
ed Nation when legal experts
say , our vote is getting weaker
all the time. Lodge emphatically
said, “The thing we are voting
on is to discuss whether to ad-
“mit them or not, we have not
even discussed it.” - ’
“Our vote is‘ getting Weaker in
relation to discussing this issue,
and if we do lose our vote, and
discuss it, then Russia would have
to get two-thirds of the assembly
to vote for them. They will ﬁnd
that this is a very rough road.”
Behavior Must Change;
“The United States will con-
tinue to vote to keep Red China
out of the UN until their imper-
ialistic behavior changes. When
it changes, if it changes-Afor it is
worse now than three years ago—-
then we will, be glad to discuss

MC Oﬂicers Don’t 
’ Know About Meetings
By Jim Neison

Although Men's Council has
met three times; this trimester,
according ,to Ben Miller, presi-
dent, the. members of the Council
and its adviser know nothing
about them. .

Miller stated lthat-at the present
time the members of the Council
were so busy that they could not
possibly be ‘expected to attend
the meeting.

The president and his commit-
tees are now performing the work
the Council should be doing.

Work planned by these com-
mittees has included aiding with
Orientation Week and co—spon-
sering of the Activities Fair with
Associated Women Students.

In the futilre the plans include
a program for freshmen men, a
Christmas Ball, the S-Award for
Tap Day, and securing permission
to reproduce the new University
seal on blazers.

The members of Men’s Council,
however. know nothing about
these past, present, or future
functions being carried on by the
president and his committee.

With the exception of the
chief justice. Herb Dodell, all of,
the members of Men’s Council
were individually interviewed.-
They are: Charles McDermott.
vice-president; Marty Rini, sec-
retary; and Melvin Praissman,
treasurer.‘

Contrary to the statement given
by Mr. Miller, none of these offi-
cers knew that meetings had been
scheduled, nor were they inform-
ed of the outcome of, the meet-
ings.-

None of these members of the
council other than the president
was even aware that Men’s Coun-
cil has a new adviser, although
it has been over a month since
he was appointed.

Nor were they aware that the
secretary had resigned, that
someone had voted to accept his
resignation, and that it has been
decided to combine the secretary
and treasurer job.

Men’s Council has given no re-
port of activities or plans to the
Senate.

Nixon Still Leads Poll

Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon has maintained his lead as
the students’ choice for the next
president of the United States over
the Democrat’s John F. Kennedy
in the latest voting poll of the
student body.

Thestudent sampling shows 49
per cent favoring Nixon, 45 per
cent for Kennedy, ﬁve per cent
undecided, and one per cent with
no opinion. .

Nixon shows a slight increase
this week of one per cent over
last week's lead of 46 per cent

‘for Nixon" and 43,per cent fol:
Kennedy. ”

 

e S I a

the three polls conduc' d thus far,
arunning tabulation shows male
students slightly favoring Kennedy
by a 51 to 49 per cent margin and
women students giving Nixon a 53
to 47 per cent edge. ,

classes‘, the “Vice-President leads

8,000 Management Opportunities!

Tliats right. There will be 8,000 .9upert‘isory
jobs filled from within the \\'esl:ern Electric
Company by college graduates in just the next
ten years! How come? Because there‘s the
kind of upward movement at \Vestern Electric
that spells excczlfire opporimlity. Young men
in engineering and other professional work can
choose between two paths of advancement——
one within their own technical field and one
within over-all management.

Your progress up—the-ladder to executive
positions will be aided by a number of special
programs. The annual company-\\1'de person-
nel surve_v helps select management prospects.
This ties in with planned rotational develop-
ment, including transfers between Bel/I Com-
panies and experience in a wide Variety of
ﬁelds. Western Electric maintains its own full-
time graduate engineering training program,
seven formal management courses, and a tui-
tion refund plan for college study.

After joining \Vestern Electric, you'll be
planning production of a steady stream of

comrnunications proclucts—-electronic switch-
ing, carrier. microwave and missile guidance
systems and components such as transistors,
diodes, ferrites. etc. Every (lay, engineers at
our manufacturing plants are working to bring
new developments of our associates at Bell
Telephone Laboratories into practical reality.
In short, “the sky's your limit" at \Vestern
Electric.

Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus-
trial, civil ond chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. For more
information, get your copy of Consider a Career at
Western Electric from your Placement Officer. Or write
College Relations, Room 6l06, Western Electric Com-
pany, I95 Broadway, New York 7, N. Y. Be sure to
arrange for cl Western Electric interview when the Bell

 *N[lCh€lS€Il Looking

 A For 3rd Straight Win  

E : By JACK SMITH

true the Panthers’ offense is ﬁnally beginning to

roll, but there is still a doubt to whether or not the Pan-

Q; thers have a good football team. The real test will come in

the next two weeks, TCU this Saturday, then Syracuse.
Certainly the Panthers cannot be considered a national

~ - It’s

‘power after gaining wins over Miami and a weak West Vir-

ginia team. Yet, the Panthers have0

shown signs of improving and

‘should they win their next two‘

"games, they could ﬁnish the sea-

‘ fson with a respectable slate.

Last year Texas Christian Uni-
versity threw a wrench into the
Panther’s plans for a bowl bid
when they stopped the Cats 13-3.
The following week Syracuse
clobbered the Panthers 35-0 to

, shatter any remaining bowl hopes
the‘ Blue and Gold might have had.

, ‘Lost Our Share’
“There is no use looking beyond
this next game,” Coach John
"Michelosen said. “A team that
,_doesn’t play their ga}nes‘one at a
time is in trouble.”
_ However, after the West Vir-
ginia victory the Pantherscould ‘
be heard talking of coming
games. “The famine is over,”
~ All-American candidate Mike_
Ditka said in the "dressing room
Saturday. “We have lost our
share of games, now ‘we i will
i start rolling.” ,
"‘I think I express the feeling
9 of the entire team when I say that
there’s only one reason we are go-
ing to TCU, that’s to win,” the
Panther captain said.

Mike Cautions Cats

, Coach Michelosen cautions his"
1 ‘Panthers against taking the Frogs

lightly. “They have a good ball
club,” Michelosen said. “We would
only hurt ourselves if we under-
estimate their strength.”
“The ‘ improvement in. our
_ running game is due largely to
the improvement in our down-
ﬁeld blocking,” Line Coach Jack
Wiley said. Wiley pointed to
- sophomore linemen Ralph Con-
rad, John Draksler, Dave Mas-
tro, Gary Kaltenbach‘ and Tom
[Brown as, the players making
the greatest progress.
.Quarterbacks Ed Schrockman

. ing practice

and Ed Clark ran at halfback in
the last game. Michelosen had
been using them at halfback dur-
because of their
speed. . ' A

“It was a good thing we ran
them there," Michelosen said. “As

it turned out, ‘two halfbacks were
injured in the West Virginia
game and Sharockman and Clark
were pressed into, service. Both
of them looked good.’ They will
see action at both quarterback
and halfback in the remaining

games.”

‘The Panther harriers visit

Meet Navy, 

weekend to run against ‘Navy
and Georgetown in a triangu-
lar meet. A ,

Coach Carl Rees’ team car-
ries a mediocre 1_-3 recordinto
the match. The Cats haven’t been
too successfui against the Middies
or Hoyas in recent years.

The Panthers haven’t beaten
either team since: 1956. Navy
thrashed them last year. Rees
said, “They’ are always in terriﬁc
condition‘ They don’t have any

exceptional runners, but they run
all summer.” ‘
Rees‘Im'pressed M

The Georgetown frosh team ﬁn-
ished third in the IC4A meet last
year, and their sophomore run-
ners will run against almost the
same boys whom they defeated at.
the New York meet. .

‘ But Rees is impressed with
the performance of his sopho-
mores this season. “If they had
. run as good last week as they
did against Penn State we would
have won.” Tarkany (Bob) was
three seconds slower against the
Mountaineers, yet he won.”

“John Towne has improved a
lot,’’ commented Rees. “He cut

week. Don Adams, a junior, ran
a minute and a half better than
last year.”

Clarke Runs Faster

“Reed Clarke cut 10 seconds
off his previous time, but he ‘is
capable of much better. Bill
Hinchberger was a half minute
slower. As captainsi they should
be the leaders.”

The _freshmen will also com-
pete with the same opponents.
The team is 2-0 to date, yet Rees
claims, “They can all run 30 sec-
onds faster than they did against
Jeannette.” The young Middies
beat the Hoya yearlings and the

Cubs last year 40-41 I‘espectively.__.

ing streak this Saturday when they travel to St. Louis to

This will be the ﬁrst time that these two teams will
' meet. The only common opponent that the Panthers and the

Billikens have played is Michigané

‘ State. The Blue and Gold lost to
MSU 4-0 two Weeks ago.

Last Saturday, the Billikens
trounced ‘ this same Michigan
State ‘team by the same score of
,4-0. In order to break the three
“game losing streak, the Panthers
jvill have to play with everything
they have.

C ‘ Racked Up 71 Goals
Last season, St. Louis racked up

' 71 goals in 12 games to the op-

 position’s 10. The Bi11iken’s record

for the past season showed 11
wins and only one defeat. So far
this year the record reads 5-1.
Coach Bob Guelker of the
Billikens, who was - nam e d
“Soccer Coach of the Year” in
1959- expects his team to be as
powerful as last year’s squad.
Coach Guelker is also looking
forward to A winning the NCAA

soccer. The other co-captain is
the inside left, Don Range. Range
was the club’s number two scorer
last year with 11 goals. Range

K St. Louis-—.Soccer City

Most of the players on the
Billikens squad are from.the St.
Louis area. More youngsters play
soccer in St. Louis than in any
other city in the United States. In
fact, the main winter sport at St.
Louis is soccer since they have no
football team.

The Panthers will be hurting
when they play these tough Bil-
likens. Z The Blue and Gold
bench support is very weak and
injuries have caused a shake up
“in the positions of the regular
first stringers. ‘ _ C - b '

director. He is in his ﬁfth year at
this position, serving the school
from which he graduated in 1954.
Treasured Object

During the World Series
"Bcano” had a holiday. “I didn’t
do a thing for two weeks. How
much space do you‘ think the
Pitts would get if the Pirates

,, would win the series?’.’

On the wall beside his desk

--f is a picture of Captain Tom
Hamilton embracing “Beano.” It
is a treasured object. “Beano”
grinned, “I worked for the
greatest guy in the world and
I'll never forget him. Even if I
got mad at him when he kept
wanting to know why wrestling
didn’t receive more publicity.”

Beano turned his thick neck,
which has an imperceptible chin.

, toward the wall where another of
’,his loves was pictured: women.
“ Kim Novak, lying on a beach in
~'a revealing bathing suit, rests at
an eye level. This reminded him
of Miami Beach where he has
the most fun or trips.
‘Big Social Flop r
“I am the biggest social flop
for not being able to get to first
base with women on Miami
Beach.”

But he claims Los Angeles is
the best city to visit. “You can

going to L.A., I wouldn’t have
any money for my life insur-
ance.” .

Beano cites Boston as having
the toughest and wisest papers.
“They went on strike when I
arrived in town.”

Lucky Man

His best friends are the Syra-
cuse writers, “They do me a favor
by not using my releases.”

“I am a lucky man,” he sighs,
“for not being ﬁred for writing
crazy releases, large expense ac-
counts and doing little work.”
Frank Carver grinned, “It’s
the miracle of the decade, that
I don’t ﬁre Beano.”

The funniest incident in Cook’s
career occured in the ’football

ppressbox. “I was running a pool,

but when the attempted fix was
revealed,’ Carver said, ‘I think you
better \quit the pool. It doesn’t
look good when the publicity di-

rector is running around with a ..

bunch of dollar bills in his
hand.” \

Beano, "who is 29, single, and
has ,no intention of becoming
otherwise, leaned back and tried

Game

   

 

For iPa'ftthers

This Saturday‘, the Panthers

‘ will be _seeking to reverse last

year’s’ 13-2 defeat by the

, Horned Frogs of Texas Chris-_

tian at Fort Worth. A capacity
crowd of 46,000 is expected
to witness the second meeting of
these two teams. 0

The Horned .Frogs are coached
by ‘Abe Martin. Martin, in his
eighth season, has compiled a 45-
27-2 record. This year’s record is
2-2-1.

Publicity Director “Beano” Cook
claimed, “This is the most im-

. portant game on our schedule. If

we don’t win it, we’ might not win
another game”. \
TCU has 18 lettcrmen re-
turning, including senior right
_ tackle Bob Lilly, described by
Martin as the best lineman he
has ever coached. Lilly has been
picked up by many for a sure
All-America berth. Top sopho-
more prospects are quarterback
Guy Gibbs, Guard Bernard Bar-
tek and End Lynn Morrison.

Center and Captain Arvie Mar-
tin will be between Left Guard
Bill Phillips and Right Guard Ray
Pinton. ' Senior Ted Crenwelge
will be at‘ the other tackle posi-
tion. Dale Glasscock is the start-
ing right end. . '

An all-senior backfield, led by
Don George at quarterback, Larry
Dawson and Larry Terrell at the
halves and Max Pierce at full-
back, complete the starting lineup.

There will be a meeting of the
Panther Club Monday, October
