City,Cdmpus Police Search for Towers Murderer

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

“We are as anxious as
anyone,” said William Mar-
kus, vice-chancellor for student
affairs, after the body of a Pitt
student had been found in the
basement of Tower A early
Thursday morning.

Since then, campus security
has increased and city homi-
cide detectives, working jointly
with Pitt’s police, report that a
composite/flyer of a possible
suspect may be released on
‘campus sometime today.

The victim, Monica Renee
Jones, 18, of Philadelphia, had
been sexually assaulted and
died as a result of manual
strangulation and choking with
an unidentiﬁed object.

Although the exact time of
death has not been deter-
mined, the Allegheny County
Coroners office indicated it
may have been close to 1:15 am
the time at which a Pitt janitor

found the body in a trash room
directly below Tower A.

The janitor, Lesley Finney,
told city police he went to
empty rubbish when he found
the door slightly open.

When he reached for the
knob, Finney said, the door
was pushed shut and locked.
He said he believed someone
inside the room had pulled the
door closed.

“The first part of that report
is accurate but the second part
has‘ to be considered pure
speculation,” said city homi-
cide Lt. Ron Freeman.

Finney said he left the area
and summoned campus police
officer Roger Dixon, who
arrived approximately an hour
later to open the door with a
pass key.

According to campus police
chief Curt Graham, there were
no other exits to the trash

-room, which is in a hallway

leading directly to the Towers
garage area.

Miss Jones, a freshman in
the College of Arts ‘and
Sciences and aresident of the
fourth ﬂoor of Tower A, had
been washing her clothes in the
basement laundry Wednesday
night.

“We are working very
closely with the campus police
and continuing the investiga-
tion on a round-the-clock

basis,” Freeman said. _ 

Two extra guards have been
‘assigned to the Towers, with
city and campus detectives
assigned to the ten-dormitory
area that houses some 4,000
students.

“There is heavy security,”
Markus said. “But we have
not changed security drama-
tically. For as dense an area as
we have, the security is fairly
sound.”

The body of an eighteen year old Pitt coed was found in this ground floor
Towers trash room early Thursday by a dormitory janitor. Authorities
will begin today circulating a composite sketch of a suspect around

campus.

Student Government Board Hopefuls Discuss Cdndiddcies

By MIKE KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer
Drew DiMaccio and Stan Galan-
ski are the two remaining presiden-
tial hopefuls for student govern-
ment elections, which begin Jan.
22. Board member Bernie Popko
has withdrawn his name from the
ballot for reasons he refused to

c o m m e n t o n ,
and Max Lash,
the only other
student to take a
petition for the
office of pres-

ident, failed to

return the petition.

Galanski, who is currently a
Student Government Board mem-
ber, and DiMaccio each prepared a
brief statement explaining their
reasons for wanting to be president
of the student government.

 

“During the past year I feel
we’ve accomplished a number of
things with the SGB, ranging from
extending the library hours to
improving our student lobby,”

Galanski said. “I feel the SGB has
great potential to do more, and I

DREW DIMACCIO

think I can contribute to this as
SGB president.

“I think there aresome problems
the new SGB must deal with,
including the PUPC and the
decreasing value of the student
activities fee. I feel I can contribute
to solving these problems, as well

as initiating some new programs,

and I think its important that the
SGB president be experienced in
student government at Pitt.”
DiMaccio said, “The main
purpose of the SGB should be
concern for students and every

opportunity should\ be taken to»

further enhance that concern. As
president a foremost concern of
mine will be student needs and
ideas as reﬂected through concern
and opportunity.

“The politicking and intimida-
tion that exists between student

government and student organiza-
tions deserves serious review of its
consequences. In my desire to lead
and represent the students and
remain open minded I in this
endeavor I feel it necessary to not
lose sight of the fact that I still am a

 

STAN G-ALANSKI

student.

“Programming, commuter in--
terests, and allocations are in need
of re-evaluation,” DiMaccio said.
“The little things that count to each
/and every student must be
attended to and resolved. These
hassles, policies and procedures
must never be neglected or ignored
no matter how small.,”

Galanski and DiMaccio will meet
for a presidential debate Wednes-
day, Jan. 17.

Also, there are 14 board
candidates, listed in the order they
will appear on the ballot: Dave
Fischio, Helen Gianella, Todd
Park, Ed Wallander, Tom Kunkel,
Rita Cordisco, Barb Madauss, Kim
Watterson, Cynthia DeMatteo,
Gene Tabachnick, Michael
Chmelovsky, Pam Curry, Robert
Daley and Greg Feinberg.

A/lcirkus ApprovesLottery, l ,936 Spcices to Uppercldssmeni

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

A room assignment lottery system that would make 57
percent of the female and 47 percent of the male returning
students eligible for housing next year ‘was approved
shortly before the end of the fall term by acting
vice-chancellor of student affairs William Markus.

Markus made the decision following weeks of debate by
the Office of Residence Life and resident student groups
that claimed the original decision to change the first come
first serve system used last year was made without
sufficient student input.

The original proposal by the Office of Residence Life
called for a lottery by class standing. With this approach,
ten percent of all available housing would go to seniors,
twenty percent to juniors, thirty percent to sophomores and

the remaining forty percent to incoming freshmen.
Resident students charged that this system discriminated
on the basis of class standing and was therefore unfair.

These resident groups confronted Markus at
November’s Student Affairs Advisory Council meeting and
were given a two week period to work on what they
believed to be a suitable alternative to the lottery by class
standing. These students later submitted to Markus a plan
that would give the student the choice of participating in a
lottery by gender or the old “first come-ﬁrst served”
system employed in other years.

According to Fred Fonseca, director of the Office of
Residence Life there are 1936 open bed spaces available for
upperclassment next year. These spaces will be bid for
beginning Jan. 29 in the Tower A Conference Room.
Students will have until Feb. 7 to select their number and
determine whether their number falls within the 1936 limit.

Housing applications will be issued at that time to 1

students who are eligible for housing. These students will
then have until Feb. 16 to complete the application and pay
the $100 advance deposit -or show proof of sufficient
ﬁnancial aid for deferral of the fee.

According to JoAnn Gibbs, assistant director of lthe
Office of Residence Life, any student that fails to meet the
deadline for filing an application and paying the necessary
fee will be placed at the end of the ’waiting list containing
those that did not draw a number making them eligible for
the housing.

The room bidding procedure whereby students are
given the choice of retaining their present rooms or bidding
on another room will remain the same as in past years and
will be held in March after all students eligible for housing
have been officially declared .

. Posvor Appoints New Head of Student Affairs

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

A seven-month search has ended
with the appointment of Conney M.
Kimbo as vice chancellor for
student affairs.

Kimbo, currently dean of stud_ent
affairs at the University of Missouri
in St. Louis, replaces Alfred L.
Moye and will assume his new
duties Feb. 19. Moye resigned
the position a year ago to become
deputy commissioner of the federal
Bureau of Higher and Continuing
Education. William Markus is the
current acting vice chancellor.

Kimbo said he would be involved
in completing work at St. Louis
through next month, but did not
anticipate any problem in the
transition to Pitt.

‘ ‘I have been in higher education
for some years and I don’t expect
the transition to be difficult,”
Kimbo said from his St. Louis
office. “We have the kind of
problems here that Pitt has. I do
have some obligations to finish up
here.”

Kimbo has been serving as the

‘chief student personnel adminis-

trator at Missouri since 1973.

ience has been on an urban

campus," Chancellor Posvar said
when he announced the appoint-
ment Dec. 13. “And he had
previously performed the same
duties at a private institution which
makes him unusually well prepared
for a university like Pittsburgh,
with its state-related, urban orien-
tation."

Kimbo was dean of student
affairs at: Grinnell College in Iowa
before moving to St. Louis.

Kimbo,visiting Pitt on three
occasions last fall, said he believed
the most important issues concern-
ing students were the security
situation, Student Union renova-
tions and programming.

Pitt’s security system received
criticism last fall after. a series of
alleged assaults at Lothrop Hall
and fear has increased after the
rape-murder of a Tower A resident
in the basement of that dormitory
late last week. ‘

“I would expect security to be
tightened—especially in the resi-
dence halls,” Kimbo said. “I
intend to talk to Fred Fonseca
(director of residence life) about
security. Something is going to
have to be done. I don’t know any
campus where security cannot be
improved.”

Kimbo said the delay in
renovating the Student Union
centered on the question of proper
funding.

“I intend -to sit down with Bill
Markus and Jack Freeman (vice
chancellor forplanning and bud-
get),” Kimbo said. “If there is any
way we can get the funding, we
certainly ought to do it. It’s obvious
that the student body has outgrown
the Schenley Hotel.”

The Pitt Union Program Council,
in its first year of operation, has
been marred by charges and
counter-charges between council
members and leaders of various
student organizations over schedul-
ing concerts.

“I did have an opportunity to
review it (the program c0uncil),”
Kimbo said. “Part of the problem
seems to be a lack of communica-
tion.” -

Kimbo, a native of McKeesport,
said, he is looking forward to
returning to western Pennsylvania.

“Pittsburgh’s a great city,” he
said. “Pittsburgh is in a better
ﬁnancial position than St. Louis. I
don’t mean that as a rap against St.
Louis, but there is just so much
potential in Pittsburgh.”

Cabinet irouble F-or lhornburg

By The Assoclatod Press

HARRISBURG—Governor-elect Dick Thornburgh’s first
cabinet nominations were greeted last week with ‘high
praise. But they could turn out to be his only “first”/choice
appointments,” according to the Philadelphia Bulletin.

The Bulletin quoted unnamed sources Sunday as saying
Theornburgh was having trouble getting his top choices to
take the 11 cabinet posts still open. Money reportedly is
one of the main drawbacks.

Still to be nominated are the secretaries of labor land
industry, general services, transportation, community
affairs, banking, revenue, health, aging and commerce.
State insurance and police commissioners also must be
named. The jobs pay from $39,000 to $44,000 a year.

No present cabinet secretaries from the Shapp
administration will be held over, the Bulletin said.

Thornburgh said Friday that getting the people he
wanted was difficult, and blamed the problem on “an
inadequate compensation schedule” and “the enormous
tasks facing us in Harrisburg.” '

0 According to the newspaper sources, Thornburgh has
spent most of his time since the November election trying
to get experienced managers to run the various branches of
state government. I

The state Division of Gaming Enforcement has filed 17

organized crime and mismanagement of its casinos here
and in the Bahamas. State Attorney General John Degnan
also opposes the license. _

The casino has been operating on a temporary permit

since it opened May 26.
Z Gov. Brendan T. Byrne said yesterday the ‘state’s case
againﬂ Restorts International has created “some
uncertainty” in the gambling industry. But he asked the
commission to decide the licensing issue without regard to
the short-term economic effects on this resort.

Byrne, a proponent of casino gambling, has taken no
stand on the hearings.

Under the stateis casino law, Resorts International must

“establish by clear and?‘convincing‘-evidence” that it is’

worthy for a permanent license. Company officials have
ﬂatly denied all of the state’s chasrges and have promised
to rebut them.

complained at a meeting
Saturday that they have been
kept in the dark about the
circumstances surrounding the
murder.

“The staff ‘is complaining
that they aren’t being told
enough,” one student close to
the Office said. “The Office
says that they just don’t have
the information to give. The
Office is receiving nothing.

Some’ resident assistants
suggested Saturday that se-
curity be tightened at dorm
entrances.’

“There is. never a desk

Hall at certain times during the
day,” one resident assistant
said, “and it‘ was suggested
that guards be posted in front
of the (Towers) garage.”

Concerned parents have
contacted the office and calls to
state legislators in)Harrisburgh
have also been reported.

Students have been asked by
the police to supply any
information pertaining to the
case.

“They (students) have been
very cooperative in helping us
with information,” one city
detective said.

It’s refreshing when any form of government
makes a decision with the masses in mind. Such an

 A P r evsfncidodc C1321:-fle(C,l l:s1t):t::irC1lt2i:l candidate for one of the

seven Student Government seats this January, /was
late with his required transcript Dec. 11, missing the
5 p.m. deadline by less than five minutes; not with his
petition, which is theoretically symbolic of backing
> - by at least lO0 students who think enough of a poten-
tial candidate to see him run for office and thus more
important, but with his transcripts, which merely
confirm the ability of the elected student to fulfill a
full term. Nevertheless, the SGB Elections Commit-
tee, the overseer of the Student Government elec-
tions, ruled that Park not be permitted on the ballot
due to the -missing of the deadline.

Two other students faced the same situation two
short years ago. Michael Bates and Sally Shoup, in

the 1977 SGB election, were denied a place on the .,

ballot. Their petitions were submitted on time, but
their transcripts were 40 minutes late. The Elections
Committee ruled to keep the pair off the ballot, as

broken—period” outlook. This stand was voiced at
the Elections Committee meeting, but none of the
voting members accepted this after hearing Park’s
side of the story. And thankfully so. Any chance to
allow qualified and concerned students to become
candidates should be considered in order to provide
the electorate withias good _a crop of candidates as
possible. Since Park had submitted a petition sym-
,bolic of 100 individuals who wanted to see his name
on the ballot, and since five minutes isn’t enough of a
blatant violation to prevent any concerned student a
chance to become involved in Student Government,
Park should be on the ballot.
The Elections Committee didn’t follow precedent.
It didn’t follow rules strictly to the letter. It inter-

preted the situation as it existed not as the rules said it

would exist. As a result, the Committee made a good
decision, ignored the ridiculously mi'nis,cule and
unimportant “rule violation,” and voted that Park
will appear on the ballot.

Let’s hope the Committee’s to see situations as

then-committee chairman Kevin Tatman explained,

“in order not to set precedent.”
Thank goodness the Committee didn’t set

precedent, or Park—or any other student in the same
situation—would not be permitted to run.
Park appealed to the committee and won by a

unanimous 5-0 vote.

Deadlines are needed to preserve organization, and
perhaps in the 1977 case the amount of time the
students inquestion missed the deadline was ex-
cessive enough to prevent organization, but the few

they exist sets a precedent.

 

moments Park missed his deadline had to be ex-

cusable, since he told two agreeing members at the
submission spot that he would have his proof of
eligibility very close to the deadline. Park’s lateness
could not have had any organizational effect on the
election.

The only argument against Park would be the

Letters  

Sociobiolo

Dr." Gaulin’s comments on
Professor Hubbard’s lecture about
Sociobiology (The Pitt News,
12/7/78) misrepresents what is at,
issue in the sociobiology debate.
He denies that sociobiology, ‘is
rooted in the 19th century
pseudoscience that claimed-;j_fe,-
males were biologically inferior.

And yet sociobiologists, with no"
direct evidence, claim that women a

are genetically “predisposed
towards certain sex roles.”

Gaulin says that sociobiologists
no longer maintain that there are
universal sex roles, only that sex
roles are determined by the
gene-environment interaction. This
isn’t entirely accurate and covers
up the true story that socio-
biologists tell.

Although sociobiologists do be-

lieve that -the environment inﬂu-

ences the behavior that results,
they limit its influence to the form

of expression within the presumed. ’
genetic limits. They refuse. to"

believe that human behavior could
ever contradict what can be

predicted by the theory of natural
selection. In other words, humans.
can do whatever their environment '-

“allows” them to»d_o, as long as it
is adaptive (as long as we are
maximizing our reproductive suc-
cess). So‘ despite the “environ-
mental inﬂuences” our genes still
dictate our behavior, since we can’t
act in other than a maximally
reproductive manner. If this isn’t
true, then sociobiologists can’t
predict anything.

No evidence, though, exists that
substantiates this “scientific”

C

gy   Issue Misrepresented

theory. There are no genes that can
be shown to control such complex
behaviors . as _._.._-xeno.phobia;,r homo-
sexuality, etc._,Th‘e. deﬁnition of
“maximally reproductive” is so

' broad? as to include both a homo-

sexuals and heterosexuals as

_ reproducing as much as possible.

Andpsociobiology is such an all
encompassing theory that it can

‘-never be disproven, even in theory

(anything can be explained as
adaptive given enough qualiﬁers
and vague statements about the
proper environment).

Sociobiologists claim to be
scientific and unbiased and accuse
their critics of being politically
motivated, and yet the picture they
paint of human nature seems
remarkably like the western society

we live in—competitive, aggres-
sive, openly altruistic while
secretly selﬁsh, male dominant,
etc. Marshall Sahlins accurately

described sociobiology as “genetic

capitalism.”

Of course we, the critics, are
biased. At least we admit to our
biases so people can understand
where we are coming from.
Sociobiologists, though, are equal-
ly biased in their mechanistic
approach to explaining human
behavior and yet pretend to be
unbiased and objective, lending a
false credibility to their pronounce-
ments. 0ne’s visions and hopes
always inﬂuence one’s research,
perhaps not overtly but in the
questions one asks and in how one
proceeds with finding the answers.
What information are sociobiol-
logists looking for. with their
“research?” What questions are
they asking? What could we
possibly learn by “proving” that
humans are genetically predis-
posed to be sexist, racist, etc. (as if
we could ever prove such things)?

Sociobiologists claim to hold
great promise for humankind by
showing us our “true nature” and
thus how to recognize the roots of
our problems in our evolutionary
history. But you can’t change your
genes (at least not yet) and so to
many people the pseudoscientiﬁc
claims of the sociobiologists will
lead to the naturalistic fallacy
“what is, should be,” or “if it is
genetic or adaptive or natural, I
shouldn't or can’t change it.” The
real questions to ask about human
behavior are not “is it genetic?" or
even‘ “is it adaptive or natural
within the context of evolutionary
theory?”—which are trivial-—but
“how easily can we change our

V i -rs-'.hehavior.and=how...hest..to.;da-that?-Z’.=:-:.s-

   

and those are questions that the
sociobiologists cannot answer.
These are questions that people
have been investigating for cen-
turies and the “biologicizing” of
the social sciences has shed very
little light on the topic. Sociobio-
logists claim to be our scientific
saviors, replacing both god and
politics with “realism,” “scientific
facts.” But soc'iobiology isn’t
realism, it’s cynicism. And it
certainly isn’t politically neutral
and unbiased research producing
facts about human behavior as they
would have us believe.

Egalitarianism is a~goal many. of
us share. And yet the social and
economic system we are a part of
dictates against it. Discrimination
is still a fact of life. And when
scientists make pronouncements

» about human behavior that could

affect such political problems, they
better be'especially careful about
what they say and how they say_it,
recognizing all its political ram-
ifications. Science produces a
powerful ideology merely because
of its prestige and the myths about
its objectivity.

Differences don’t have to mean
discrimination. But the ideology of
genetic determinism reinforces

discrimination by describing it as A

natural, something we can only
change “with grave conse-
quences” (Hamilton has even
described racism as having “deep
roots in our animal past and is quite
likely to rest_on direct genetic
foundations”). Egalitarians have
nothing to fear from the truth, just

"from political predjudices mas-

querading as scientific fact.

Look. ‘Up on the silver screen. It’s a fantasy. It’s
an experience. It’s “Superman: The Movie.”

Yes, it’s “Superman,” two years in the making
but ﬁnally arriving in neighborhood theaters with an
entertainment value far beyond those of mortal
movies.

“Superman,” able to change the course of mighty
rivers, justify your paying the $3.75 admission price,
bend the egos of those who say they are above such

frivolity. 

And which, costing a record-breaking $45 million
to produce, is the best adaptation of Superman’s
original exploits.

Like the character it depicts has done for 40 years,
“Superman” fills the hearts and captures the
imaginations of fantasy-seekers of all ages. The ﬁlm
expertly brings to life the romantic ﬁgure who has
become nothing less than an American institution.

The title role belongs to newcomer Christopher
Reeve, who, unlike his predecessor George Reeves of
the 1950s television series, looks and acts the part of
Superman, alias Clark Kent, to perfection. Margot
Kidder plays an untiring Lois Lane equally to the tee.
Also working for the Metropolis Daily Planet are
Jackie Cooper as editor Perry White and Marc
McClure as Jimmy Olsen.

Susannah York and the handsomely paid Marlon
Brando are Superman’s Kryptonian parents who

’ send their infant son to Earth after discovering their

planet is doomed. Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford as
Ma and Pa Kent later provide a foster home for the
boy in Smallville, U.S.A.

Gene Hackman’s performance as Superman’s

' arch-enemy Lex Luthor risks bordering inanity, but

not to the extent of emulating the vacuous villians of

deviated from the original comic book molds.

Rather, the ﬁlm can be likened to a two-hour and-1,5
minute comic book, which in the long run is its
biggest attribute.

All the familiar ingredients are there: The
kryptonite. The phone booth (with a delightful
twist). The speeding bullet. The powerful
locomotive. The tall buildings. And, of course,
truth, justice and the American way.

Wry tongues often are impaled in the actors’

Its first two sections, devoted to Superman’s origins
on Krypton and in Smallville, are fraught with
discrepancies that insult the comic book’s
connoisseurs.

Those offenses are forgotten, however, soon after
Clark Kent’s first dramatic switch to Superman in the
ﬁlm’s ﬁnal sequence. From there, the expensive
special effects aid in the action and even in a bit of
suspense.

As for the plot, which is sprinkled with successful
gags and one-liners, Superman is pitted against the

'Supermon'

Changing With the Times But Always cu Hero

By STEVE GUIDAS
Pitt News Staff Writer

It has been said that time
changes a person, and the Man of
Steel is no exception. When the
idea of Superman was conceived in
1938, there was a limit to his
powers and abilities.

Some 40 years later, almost’

nothing can stop him. Not only has
Superman undergone changes over
the years, but so has his alter ego,
Clark Kent.

In the late 1930s, America was
emerging from the Great Depres-
sion. Rumors of war spread
throughout Europe, and the comic

[—Io.I

Supefman (aka Clark Kent) and Lois
Lane made their debut in Action
,Comics,No. _1.

book, as it is known today, was in
its infancy. Superman came into
being at this time, fulﬁlling the
imaginations of people as the type
of hero they wanted.

Superman made his debut in
Action Comics in June of 1938. His
story began by showing a rocket-
ship containing the infant son of a
scientist excaping the exploding
planet Krypton. The ship
enventually reached the earth, and
the baby is found and later adopted
by the Kents who name him Clark.

Told by his foster parents that he
must hide his awesome powers
from people so as not to scare
them, young Clark decided to wait
until the proper time before using

3 them. However, he did learn that
i he was able to “hurdle skyscrap-

ers, leap an eighth of a mile, raise
tremendous weights, and nothing
less than a bursting shell ,could
penetrate his skin!”

Although ‘no explanation was

‘ given on how he is able to do all '

this, Clark decided to use these
strengths to beneﬁt mankind upon
reaching adulthood.

Superman, under his secret
identity, takes on a job as a
‘fmild-mannered” reporter for the
Daily Star, working for editor
George Taylor. That job enabled
him to ﬁght crime as Superman and
later report it under the byline of
Clark Kent.

Fellow reporter Lois Lane made
her first appearance in the initial
issue as well. From the beginning

she was infatuated with Superman
and gave Clark the cold shoulder.
It wasn’t long before she suspected
a connection between the two.

As the 1930s gave way to the 40s,
subtle changes began to occur.
Without explaination, the Daily
Star became the Daily Planet and
editor George Taylor’s name was
changed to Perry White.

Superman was no longer conﬁn-
ed to leaping from building to
building; he had acquired the
ability to ﬂy. There also came an
increase in his strength and speed.

Barely oputracing a streamline
train a few years back, the Man of
Tommorrow now was traveling at
the speed of light. He was able
to survive atomic blasts, instead of
mere bursting shells.

By the end of the decade,
Superman’s origin was revealed.
He was Kal-El, the sole survivor of
the planet Krypton, whose inhabi-
tants had perfected themselves
both physically and mentally. The
greater size of Krypton would
enable its people almost to defy the
weaker gravity of Earth. Besides
the powers already known, Super-
man was able to see through
objects, courtesy of x-ray vision.

When the 1950s emerged, many,

comic book heros had bit the dust.
Superman was able to hold his own
as changes in both the character
and the strip continued.

Although he had powers and
abilities far beyond those of mortal
men, Superman easily could be

weakened by green fragments that
had once been part of his home
planet—more commonly known as
kryptonite.

Adventures of Superboy were
introduced, contradicting the idea
that the Man of Steel waited until
manhood before coming to the aid
of all mankind. Superboy, too, had
a troublesome female to contend
with by the name of Lana Lang.

The ’50s also saw the introduc-
tion of other survivors of Krypton.
There was Supergirl, the younger
cousin of Superman. Like her
cousin, Supergirl was rocketed to
earth, except she came from a
section of Krypton that survived
the initial blast.

Krypto, who had been infant
Kal-El’s pet dog while on Krypton,
reached earth by way of. a
experimental rocketship that was
lost in space for quite some time.

There was the bottled city of
Kandor, whose citizens were
reduced to microscopic size and
kidnapped by the evil mind
Brainiac. After a battle with
Brainiac, Superman was able to
rescue his fellow Kryptonians, but
was unable to enlarge them to their
original size.

By the time the 19605 arrived,
Superman was able to ﬂy to the
ends of the universe and was
invulnerable to any form of
destruction. No longer did the
theory of earth's lesser gravity hold
up in explaining his superior
abilities. Earth’s yellow sun, as

compared with the red sun of
Krypton, was given as the reason
for all of Superman’s powers.
Not only was Superman protector
of earth, but the rest of the
universe as well, battling evil in
many forms other than human.
All the while Superman was
changing, his secret identity, Clark
Kent remained about the ‘same. It

wasn’t until the early 1970’s, that a»

difference in the lifestyle of Kent
came—change with the times.
He was transferred to reporting
news as a roving reporter for
television station WGBS in Metro-
polis.

Soon, he became anchorman for
the evening news at that station.
Very recent issues of the strip have
him returning to the Daily Planet,
however. ‘

So it

seems that

earth's

.mightiest being, Superritan, just

may indeed be vulnerable to only
one thing—changes.

Bruce Springsteen Rocks On in Holiday Concert

By MARK HOLAN
Pin News Staffwrirer

Bob Dylan's guilty. Eric
Clapton’s guilty. Rod Stewart’s
guilty. Even the Rolling Stones are
guilty. They're all guilty of going
for the “big bucks”. Their music
has diminished in quality as much

as the length of their concerts.
Bruce Springsteen, in spite of
front cover publicity in “Time”,
,“Newsweek", and more recently,
“Rolling Stone", remains true to
his fans and to rock ‘n’ roll. Just
ask any of the several thousand
fans who stood in cold rain outside

Oasis Records Dec. 8 to catch
Springsteen at the Stanley Theater
on Dec. 27 and 28. Both shows sold
out but Springsteen didn’t.

Springsteen is to the 705 what
the others mentioned above were to
the 60s. He is a true rock ’n’ roller.
If you’ve seen him in concert, you
already know that. If you haven't,
well, try and catch him the next
time around for a solid night of
exciting proof.

There is no pretense to Spring-
steen's show. Unlike the Stones,
who in Cleveland this past July had
to rely on a giant flashing

scoreboard to remind everyone that
they were “the world’s greatest
rock band,” Springsteen lets his
music, its passion and energy, do
all the convincing. And his shows
are more than twice; as long too.

From his latest release, “Dark-
ness On the Edge of Town,
Springsteen played “Badlands,”
“Candy's Room,” “Racing in the
Street" ‘and the album’s entire
second side, including “The
Promised Land,” “Factory,"
“Streets of Fire” and the title
track.

He also played the majority of his

Consistent Album From Poco

By MARK HOLAN
and SUE VUCIC

Legend
Poco
ABC Records

If you don’t mind a slight-break
in tradition, “Legend,” the new
album from Poco, is worth hearing.
The band, known mostly for their
easy California sound, has added a
few more rockers than usual to this
album.

Only two of the original band
members remain, Rusty Young and
Paul Cotton. Young wrote six of the
album’s nine songs and Cotton the
remainder. They do the vocals and
guitar work and are backed by
Charlie Hanison on bass and Steve
Chapman on drums, as well as ﬁve
additional studio musicians, three
Of\ whom add. keyboard and
synthesizer to the band’s sound.

The first side opens with a fair

 

WIEJNTE

rocker called “Boomerang.” This

,song features the album’s only

solo, a guitar riff by Cotton.

It is followed by one of the
album’s better and more mellow
tunes, “Spellbound.” Young wrote
this one and it proves that Poco is
just as poetic and lyrical as they
have been on past albums.

“Barbados,” “Little Darlin”’
and “Love Comes Love Goes”
complete the first side. All three
are mild rockers, good tunes, but
not standouts.

The ‘second side opens with
“Heart of the Night.” The song is

another mild rocker about that -

famous city at the mouth of the
Mississippi, New Orleans.

It is followed by two more of the
album’s mellow songs, “Crazy

Both songs are about love and
leaving. “The Last Goodbye” is
the better of the two and could

easily pass for an Eagles tune-

The album concludes with the
title track “Legend.," It is a good
rocker about the red-eyed horse on
the album cover named Thunder
Road. Poco’s imagery, however, is
quite different than Bruce Spring-
steen’s.

“Legend” is primarily mild rock.
It lacks a long mellow piece like
“Magnolia” or “Crazy Eyes” from
earlier albums, but this new album
from Poco is consistant and
well-arranged and makes for good

listening.

album. “Thunder Road,” “Tenth
Avenue Freeze-Out’,, “Back-
streets,” “She’s the One,” “Jung-
leland” and the title track all were

received with thunderous app-
lause.
From earlier albums, Spring-

steen did “Rosalita,” “Fourth of
July, Asbury Park (Sandy),”
“Kitty's Back” and “Spirits in the
Night.” Also in the show were
“Fire,” “Because the Night” and
“The Fever." These were written
by Springsteen but are performed
by other artists. The Pointer
Sisters, Patty Smith and South Side
Johnny and The Asbury Jukes
respectively.

Added to all this were a few more
songs not written by Springsteen

but performed as if they had
been-Buddy Holly’s “Not Fade
Away” and, in the spirit of
Christmas, “Santa Claus is
Coming to Town.”

Every song was sung and played
with feeling and energy. Spring-
steen, not noted for being one of
rock’s prime guitarists, played
excellently. His instrumental work
was topped only by saxaphonist
Clarence Clemons. The entire East
Street Band was tight throughout
the show.

In time, fame and fortune will
probably corrupt Bruce Spring-
steen like it has so many other
performers. But for now, as he
said at the end of his show, Bruce
Springsteen is “just a prisoner of
rock and roll.”

Public Theater Reviveswilde in ‘Earnest’ Effort

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Importance of Being Earnest
Written by Oscar Wilde
Directed by Ben Shaktman

Although you, might have to
suffer through Act I on one of the
wooden benches reserved for the
standing room only ticketholders at
Allegheny Theater, the torture is
worth the chance to see the
Pittsburgh Public Theater’s pro-
duction of “The Importance of
Being Earnest.”

On weekday evenings, most
people in the crowd manage to get
a seat somewhere, and they can sit
and enjoy fully the hilarious play.
Part of the play’s success lies in the
one-liners and double-entendres
that Wilde wrote, but the timing
that the cast has mastered ensures
that the comedy keeps the audience
laughing.

'King of

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer,

‘-‘King of the Gypsies” takes a
fascinating but disturbing look at
the modern day American gypsy
culture.

The plot revolves around the
Stepanowicz clan, the reigning
family among a tribe of urban
gypsies settled in New York. A
new gypsy king must be chosen
when the family’s king and leader,
played to the hilt by the
domineering Sterling Hayden, lies
on his deathbed from too much
high living.

A bloody and brutal power
struggle develops between I a
sadistic alcoholic father (Judd
Hirsch from television’s p“Taxi”)

Wilde’s comedy is an endless
series of word plays, including the
convoluted play on the word
earnest throughout the plot. The
play begins with Algernon Mon-
crieff and John Worthing, who is
known as Earnest by Algernon and
everone else in London._ Lady
Bracknell, Algernon’s aunt, arrives
with Algemon’s cousin Gwen-
dolyn, whom John loves.

John proposes marriage to
Gwendolyn and she agrees be-
cause she is enthralled by his
pseudonym, Earnest. However,
Lady Bracknell has other plans for
Gwendolyn and forbids the two to
see each other when she learns
John is a foundling who was
abandoned in Victoria Station.

In the second act, Moncrieff
travels to John’s country home to
discover what John’s young ward,
Cecily, looks like. He arrives at the
house, posing as John’s wicked

and his reluctant son David
(Newcomer Eric Roberts) over who
will ascend to the throne of gypsy
king.

The handsome and likeable
David is the handpicked choice of
his dying grandfather. The boy is
his favorite grandson and has
been tutored by both his mother
and the king himself to work cons
and hustle on the streets.

There=is one problem. David

despises the gypsy life, which‘

emphasizes cons, card sharking,
pre-arranged marriages to the
highest bidder and prostitution by
the gypsy women, which "is
encouraged by the men.

He ﬂed in his early teens to try
and start a life outside of gypsy

brother Earnest, who was invented
by John to explain his sojourns in
London. Cecily and Moncrieff fall
immediately in love, because
Cecily is enthralled by the name
Earnest.

John arrives and announces his
fictional brother has died, but finds
that Moncrieff is there already,
pretending to be his brother. John
rushes to the church to be
christened Earnest to please his
ﬁancee, Gwendolyn, and while he
is at church, Gwendolyn arrives to
ﬁnd John’s beautiful ward Cecily in
the garden.

A ﬁght ensues because they
believe they are engaged to the
same man, Earnest Worthing. In
the end Algernon and John arrive
and the two women learn neither of
them are engaged to Earnest
Worthing, and they stalk from the
garden, spurning the two men who
have not been earnest.

save his sister (Brooke Shields)
from a pre-arranged marriage.

His father wants the throne and
is driven into.a furious rage when

David tries to rescue his sister. He '

hires assassins to kill his son so
that his quest for power can be
fulﬁlled.

This confrontation, pitting father
against son, leads to a grim and
extremely bloody ﬁnal 30 minutes,
as the kingship is ﬁnally decided
through a series of brutal acts of
violence.

The ﬁlm’s script, based loosely
on Peter Maas’ book, depicts the
modern day gypsy culture as a

In the ﬁnal act of the play, Lady
Bracknell arrives at Worthing’s
home and reveals that Cecily’s
governess once removed her
nephew from her home and the
child was never seen again. The
governess reports she accidentally
left the child in Victoria Station,
and they ﬁnd that John is the child
who she abandoned. His real name
is the same as his father’s,
Earnest, of course.

The whole cast in the play is
excellent, but Samuel Maupin, who
portrays Algernon, is a standout in
the cast. Maupin shows his ability
in the second act when he greets
John and pretends to be his brother
Earnest. Maupin smiles mockingly
at Douglas Stender, who plays
John Worthing and greets his
supposed brother—dressed in
mourning—with a warm embrace,
much to Worthing’s disgust.

stream. '

In the ﬁlm, gypsy men are shown
in a unsympathetic light.‘ The
women perform all of- the real
breadwinning cons, usually fortune
telling, tea readings and prostitu-
tion, while the men just play cards
and gamble away their days,
avoiding honest work at all costs.

Roberts, in his ﬁrst ﬁlm, is
superb. His presence dominates
and gives the ﬁlm impact.

Hayden is well cast in the role of
the gypsy head. He is obnoxious,
dynamic and believable. Shelly
Winters plays the grandmother of
the clan and adds nothing of real
note other than she looks as big as
an elephant and weeps annoyingly

Bracknell, masterfully portrays the
role of the stodgy and snobbish
Victorian woman. She always
delivers her quips and insults:
perfectly so that they boomerang:
on her.

Although the entire cast is
excellent, one man with the most
minor role in the play outshines the
rest of the actors. John Scanlon, a
weathered veteran of Broadway
and Off-Broadway, draws belly
laughs from the crowd whenever he
appears onstage.

His ﬁnest moment is during an
exchange between Cecily and
Gwendolyn. Gwendolyn asks for
tea withoiit sugar and bread and
butter, but Cecily prepares her a
cup of tea with a sugar bowl of
sugar and a plate of cake. Cecily
orders Scanlon, who plays Merri-
man the butler, to serve the plate,
and he hands Gwendolyn the plate
and sprints from the garden before
a battle royale erupts.

Steelers Ice Houston, Cowboys Batter Rams  
Cambell Stopped (b y the) Cold

By CRIS HOEL

Pitt News Sports Editor

An early Steeler scoring splurge and
Dallas’ late charge produced another
Pittsburgh-Dallas Super Bowl yesterday, as
each team denied another franchise its ﬁrst

trip to pro football’s ﬁnal game.

Houston’s running game, which had
carried Earl Campbell's team to its first

American conference championship game,
was not as slick as Three Rivers Stadium’s

soaked surface yesterday afternoon and

Terry Bradshaw 'led his Steelers to a 34-5
win. Dallas followed the AFC game with a
28-0 drubbing of Los Angeles’ long-suffering
Rams, whose many playoff appearances
have yet to yield a spot in the_ Super Bowl.
Dallas’ National Conference title guaran-

teed by three fourth-period touchdowns, was
its second consecutive.

Pittsburgh pulled away form Houston in
the ﬁrst half; a 29-yard Bradshaw-to-Lynn
Swann touchdown pass in the ﬁrst half’s
ﬁnal minute gave the Steelers a 21-3 lead

that was 10 points richer before the half

ended. Houston fumbled twice and

Pittsburgh scored each time.

The Steelers coasted—and, on the wet
artiﬁcial turf, sometimes slipped——to victory

during a second half that produced little

more than frozen fans and iced players.

While Houston was stopped by fumbles
(six total and three by Campbell), Los
Angeles’ backfield was stopped-even
flattened—-by Cowboy lineman Randy
White, who sent Ram quarterback Pat
Haden and runner John Cappelletti to
hospitals with bone-breaking and shoulder-
dislocating tackles, respectively.

Charlie Waters intercepted a pair of
passes for Dallas; each was followed by a
Cowboy score in a game that sent Dallas to
its ﬁfth Super Bowl (a record). Los Angeles
was National Conference runner-up for the
fourth time in ﬁve years.

Pittsburgh, twice National Football Lea-
gue champion, will play in a Super Bowl for
the third time though Mike Barber, who was
the Oiler tightend until the second quarter of
yesterday’s game, threatened to prevent one
Steeler from playing.

Barber, still moving after a pass sailed
past him during the quarter’s ﬁrst play, was
hit by Steeler safety Mike Wagner; Barber
left the game with a knee injury after the
collision, which Barber called “a cheap
shot.”

“He (Wagener) won't play in the Super
Bowl,” Barber said. “I'll get him back, and
when I do, he won’t play a game again.”

Wagner did not seen upset by Barber's
threat. “What’s he going to do,” Wagner
said. “Wait for me in the driveway?”

SYRACUSE-—There is a light at

But even while trapped in a dark

this much about the team that ran
them over here Saturday evening:
it was big, it was fast and"it was

Syracuse’s Orangemen (9-2)

and exploited Pitt’s impatient

which was broadcast by WTAE-TV
in Pittsburgh, from Manley ﬁeld V
house. . l
V The Orange raced to a 10-point
lead during the game's ﬁrst 10

the margin until it reached 31

frenzied crowd of 9,300‘ screamed
for 100 points. 1

Each team sent almost every
suited player into the- game and the
substitutes’ performances often

Sherrill’s lob:
Recruit, Recruit

ORLANDO, FLA.—At this time last year the list
read Matt Cavanaugh, Elliott Walker, Bob Jury,
Randy Holloway, Randy Reutershan, J.C. Wilson
and Tom Brzoza. This year it reads Jimmy Johnson,
Pat Jones, Larry Holton, Don Boyce, Dave Wari-
nstedt and Tony Wise. Faced with rebuilding a foot-
ball team a year ago, Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill now
must do the same with his coaching staff.

While the arrival of an assistant coach will rarely
receive the publicity that accompanies the signing of
a “blue-chip” recruit, those youngsters are always
well aware of who will be their mentor before any let-
ters are signed. So, indirectly, Sherrill is faced with
the same task. If capable assistants are not hired

Bob Labriola

soon, the recruits who had been leaning toward a
four-year career at Pitt might start shopping
elsewhere.

The Panthers return 34 of their top 44 players, so
Sherrill will have the luxury of recruiting by position.

_. Sherrill had indicated he will go after quarterbacks,

defensive linemen, defensive backs, players - with
game-breaking potential and the “big running
back,” but not necessarily in that order. ‘ 1
“All we can do is just go back to work,” Sherrill
said after his team’s 30-17 loss to North Carolina
“We have .a lot of
on defense and .in the offensive line.’’
And in the coaching staff.

' Johnson took J ones,» Holton, Wise and Wannstedt
with him to Oklahoma, State, while Boyce was
relieved of his duties as offensive coordinator at half.-
time of the Tangerine Bowl. Boyce has been offered
a different position on Sherrill’s staff, but it is doub-
tful he would accept the demotion unless no other of-
fers are forthcoming. ' '

Serafino “Foge” Fazio has been named to replace"
Johnson as defensive coordinator and Jimmy Sharpe

(Continued on page 13)

While Sherrill allowed, “We
didn’t. play as well as we could,” he
wouldn’t blame it on the prepar-

ation. _
“We went to the same places

they did and practiced the same

quarters of the Tangerine Bowl

_‘ interview room. It was not simply
downhill, it was downhill fast.

The Panthers, in the fine
tradition of Franz, Klammer, made
it to the bottom of the hill in less
than 25 minutes, and North
Carolina State, which had posted a
17-0 lead during that time, coasted
to a 30-17 victory.

Theoretically, a bowl game is
supposed to be the culmination of a

team’s season. This year was one -

of offensive and defensive short-
comings that Pitt exhibited at
various times; the Tangerine Bowl
was the place the Panthers decided

The 31,356 saw offensive play
reminiscent of the Navy game,
defensive. play not unlike that
shown in the second half at South
Bend and. a kicking‘ game that
produced no net return yardage
and allowed a Joe Gasparovic punt
to be partially blocked‘. '

Pitt showed the Wolfpack a
three-wide receiver formation for a
portion of the first half, but this
confused no one wearing red that
evening and the Panthers were
limited to 107 total yards in the ﬁrst
half. The breakdown (48 yards
rushing to 59 passing) proved that
while the offense was impotent, it
was, as least. balanced.

“We couldn’t get anything

- established,” Sherrill ‘said. “We

wanted to do some things early
with different formations and
motion, but we'couldn’t do it. After
we got behind, we couldn’t get
back in the game.

“And then, we had trouble with
turnovers,” Sherrill added.

The four interceptions (three
thrown by Rick Trocano and one by
Lindsay Delaney) directly account-
ed for 10 Wolfpack points and
stopped two Pitt drives headed for
apparent paydirt. Trocano also was
sacked five times, and each
quarterback received a sizeable
share of physical punishment from

the North Carolina State defense.

“N.C. State was the problem,”
said Trocano when he was asked to
pinpoint the reason for the defeat.
“I got the wind knocked out of me,
I got intercepted and 1 got sacked.

“Put it this wayi” the sopho-

more continued, “they were ready‘

for us. -They came ready to play.”

Whether the Panthers had made
the trip to Orlando with the same
objective in mind was the topic of

much debate since jai alai, Mickey ~

night life crowded football ‘in the
Pitt schedule.

time,” said Sherrill. “lf 1 had to do
it over again, we’d prepare the
same way, just execute better.”
Even the defense, which had
become the stalwart of the alumni
and fans, executed poorly in
Orlando. Ted Brown rushed for 126
of the Wolfpack’s 207 yards on the
ground, while an ‘allegedly weak
passing attack burned Pitt on
several third downs, once pro-
ducing a 55-yard touchdown play.
“It was a play-action pass and
the back (Lynn Thomas) just got
beat,” said Sherrill. “They caught
us in one-on-one coverage and the
kid (Buster Ray) just beat us.”

(Continued from page 12)

Pitt’s pl_ay improved when Dwayne
Wallace and Darrell Gissendanner,
a pair of freshman guards whose
previous contributions this season
were negligible, entered the
contest.

Pitt’s starting guards, senior
captains Wayne Williams and Pete
Strickland, were 0-of-ll from the
field; Pitt’s starting (and, until
Saturday, scoringlforwards, Terry
Knight and Samm-ie..r;_Ellis,l could
-score but eight points each; and
Sam Clancy, though he accumulat-
ed 21 points and 14 rebounds, -hurt
the Orange only when he out-
jumped 6-11 center Roosevelt
Bouie to start the game and soared
past Bouie to score the game's first
basket moments later. -

Though the Young guards’
scoring (Wallace’s 13 points came
during 15 minutes of action;
Gissendanner’s 13 minutes pro-
duced 10 points) was accomplished
during a sloppy run-and-shoot
portion of the game, it was perhaps
the single bright spot Pitt could

discern as its record fell,to 

(after a 5-0 start).

Pitt’s experience—and the
chance to allow new players to
develop——was to have been a
valued change this season. But
Pitt’s older players have been to
blame during Pitt’s recent slump
and Saturday night's statistics
were as bad as the last-minute
folds that led to Pitt’s other losses.

Four of Pitt's starters combined
to produce 20 turnovers (Terry_
Knight, the other starter, played
less than half the game) and, while
the ofﬁciating was the cause
several times, the Panthers’
inability to hold possession pre-
vented them from even attempting
to match the Orange.

A Manley mauling is not unusual
for~__Syracu’se’s opponents. Satur-
day's win was Syracuse's 36th
consecutive" victory at home and
that string equals one set by the
Orange in the early 70s.

“But it wasn't the place that beat
us." Grgurich said. “It_ was their

. -1 —,

players. They just beat us.”
Before the Syracuse game,

Grgurich seemed to have chosen.

seven players as those who would
see more than a piddling amount
of playing time. But 10 players
scored for Pitt against Syracuse
and, since Pitt’s reserves fared as
well as the Panther first string, it
appears likely Grgurich will con-
tinue to substitute freely.

Pitt shot poorly (30.8 percent)
while Syracuse was rolling toward
its 43-25 halftime edge. And when
the Panthers bettered their per-
formance to 46 percent in the last
half, Syracuse countered with 20
minutes in which 62 percent of its
shots were productive.

Louis Orr, a thin forward who
roamed unfettered around Pitt’s
basket, led Orange scorers with 18
points. Bouie, a 6-11 center whose
name and sjze far exceed his talent,
followed with 14 and 6-11 center
Dan Schayes produced 10.

The Panthers outrebounded Syr-
acuse, 44-39, I and outfouled the
Orangemen, 30-24.

believed the team might be

Orange coach Jim Boeheim and
three freshman—one of whom
transferred to Iona and two of
whom returnechto the team without
penalty after complaining and
leaving.

Cincinnati, Pitt's next opponent,
also has had program problems
recently. Ravage-and-run coach
Gale Catlett, current West Virginia
coach, left the Bearcats a trail of
NCAA violations that led to a
recent penalty of probation for
Cincy’s program. More recent was
the dismissal ‘of two Bearcats
involved in an Ohio burglary case.

But such problems, known. too
well to Pitt’s basketball program in
recent seasons, fio longer afflict the
Panthers. This may not be the
20-win team -Pitt's players hope to
be, but there seems to be nothing
wrong with the Panthers the Field
House can’t cure.

        Help  (And  
O” / Needed) by Pitt

(Continued from page_ I2)

recently was hired from Virginia Tech to replace
Boyce as offensive coordinator. Sharpe was Bear
Bryant's top assistant in the early 70s, and Sherrill’s
teammate before that. Depending on Boyce’s
decision, Sherrill has filled five of eight staff
positions and doesn't expect to have much trouble
ﬁlling the vacancies.

“You can hire assistant coaches,” Sherrill said in
Orlando. “If I wanted to, I could do it tonight.”

What Sherrill has already done is to junk the veer
as Pitt’s offensive formation and replace it with the
pro set and‘ the I formation. ‘Each of these sets
demands a fullback, and the Panthers have already
brought in a candidate for that job in ‘junior college
transfer. Evidently, the pony backs have been put
out to pasture for good.

Sherrill also is likely to change some of his policies
governing the players. What those changes will entail
is not known at the present, but let it suffice to say
the Panther bureaucracy was mortally wounded
during the 1978 season.

If the coaching defections and changes have an ad-
verse affect of the reputation of the program, the
ground previously gained in the national recruiting
picture will be lost. Part of the “Major change” in
Pitt football was that schoolboy grid stars no longer
laughed at letters from Cas Mysl.inski’s athletic
department.

Bowl, he has said he will be spending considerable
time recruiting in the Pittsburgh area in upcoming
weeks. Obviously, the Panther coach recognizes the
problem and is preparing to meet it head-to-head.

The winner will be announced no later than Feb.
15 (national letter-of-intent day). ,

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Cal Poly wrestling coach
Vaughan Hitchcock was puzzled by
his team’s easy 33-11 victory over
Pitt Dec. 13 at the Field House.
“We anticipated a real battle,”
hesaid. “But we found it easier to
score points against them. I don’t
think Pitt wrestled up to its
capabilities . ’ ’

Of the Panthers’ 11 team points,
six were by_ forfeit—Mustang
158-pounder Steve Hitchcock (the

coach's son) bowed out to Tom,

Jones. Otherwise, Pitt could only
muster Jim Gordon’s 4-3 decision
over Terry Markou at 177 and Jose
Martinez’s —6-6 tie with Don
LeMelle at 126 against eighth-
ranked Cal Poly, which was
wrestling its ﬁfth match in ﬁve

nights on an eastern tour.

“That (match) was ridiculous,”
Panther head coach Dave Adams
claimed. “We try not to be as ﬂat
as we were. It looked like we were
the ones making the long tour. We
didn’t do anything at all.”

Pitt (0-2) hosts Lycoming tomor-
row at 7:30 p.m. at the Field
House. The only probable change
in the starting lineup will be the

PITT NOTES: Gordon Jones was

time in 27 games...Freddie Jacobs

passes, and Delaney connected on

insertion of 167-pounder Skip
Bolin, ousted from college wrest-
ling over a year ago after an auto

accident damaged his right knee-,

cap. Jim Gordon would move up to
177, and Pat Connor would move
up to 190;

“A lot depends on his health,”
Adams said of Bolin, whose only
competition since the accident was
a 5-5 tie against Bloomsburg’s
Eastern Wrestling League 167-
pound champ Dom DiGioacchino
Nov. 21. “We’ll put him in there as
much as we can. With two

experienced guys (301111 and
Gordon), we should have a good
team.”

The Panthers will need the
experience with the likes of
Maryland, Clarion and Lehigh
(ranked 6th) on the immediate
schedule. But ﬁrst, Pitt must climb
past Lycoming.

“They’re a tough small school,”
assistant coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. “We don’t break the season
for them by winning-, but we make
the season for them be losing.”

Bucknell a ‘I une-lip,’
Swim Coach Claims

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer 7

Pitt swim coach Fred Lewis
expects his team (1-0) to have
“some fun” tomorrow afternoon
against Bucknell at Trees,Poo1.

According to Lewis, Bucknell is
good, but “not the greatest team in
the world" and should be no match

for the Panthers.

“The Bucknell meet is just a
tune-up for us,” Lewis said. “We
have some ‘tough meets coming up.
The season won’t get any easier. I
want our kids to have some fun
while they can.”

The Panthers, who defeated
North Carolina last month, meet
nationally ranked Ohio State and
Eastern powers Maryland and
West Virginia within the next
month.

Against Bucknell, Pitt is expect-
ed to dominate every event except
the 50-yard freestyle. As usual,
Lewis declined to accounce his

starting lineup, but no major
changes were expected.
“They're good, but they're

deﬁnitely not an Ohio State or
North Carolina,” Lewis said about
Bucknell, perennial champion of
the Middle Atlantic Conference.
“They mainly swim against smaller
Division 11 schools and teams like
Temple and LaSalle.”

SWIM NOTES: Tomorrow’s
meet starts at 3:30 p.m.
Ordinarily, home meets are held
during the evening, but“ Bucknell
requested that the meet be
changed to the afternoon...The
Panthers planned to spend their
entire Christmas break in Florida,
but returned a week and a half
earlier because of inclement
weather in the Tampa area...

Long distance specialist Dale
Pﬂaumer suffered a partially torn
knee ligament while in Florida, but
will continue to swim...Jeff Trew,
who was undefeated in the long
distance events last season, will be
used more at middle distance this
year...Trew suffered his first
collegiate defeat against North
Carolina...Rick Carter (2nd) and
Mickey Termin (5th) are ranked
among the Eastern leaders in the
50-yard freestyle."

Withouttheir distance runners,
Penn State’s Lady Lions are merely
a good team. With them, however,
they are just about unbeatable (at
least in the East). It was by the
strength of those distance runners
that PSU outdistanced the Panther-
ettes, 64-49.

Pitt relied heavily on the scoring
of its ﬁeld and sprint women to
ﬁnish closer to the three-time

Pantherettes, 64-49

EAIAW champs than ever before in
Pantherette history. Led by
freshman Peri Jude Radecic’s
shotput of 44 (a foot short of
meeting the qualifying standard for
the outdoor national champion-
ships), Pitt swept the event. Team
captain Marie Ribik won the high
jump at 5-6, while another
freshman, Cissy Wilbom, captured
ﬁrst place in the long jump.

When congratulated on the
performance of his athlete’s
success’, said Dan Goodyear, coach
of the men and women jumpers, “I
didn’t do anything. The girls
deserve all the credit.” He singled
out pentathlete Pam Shaw as the
“athlete of the meet.”

“Pam was amazing. First, she
set a personal record in the
shotput, then she cleared 4-10 in
only the second time she’s ever
highjumped.”

Shaw was leading the pentathlon
after two events and was ahead in
the third (hurdles) when she hit a
hurdle, lost her balance and in the
fall, injured her shoulder. She was
unable to finish the meet.

Leslie Palmer won both the
hurdles and S0-yard dash for the
Pantherettes. while Gwen Murray
rlefcated PSU’s top sprinter. Lea
Venlura, in the 220—yard dash.

Both Palmer and Murray, along
with Wilborn and Linda Mitchell.
were part of the 880-yard relay that
came closest of any Pitt relay to
winning. They ﬁnished less than

(one second behind the Lady Lion

team.

The Pantherettes' next meet will
be Jan. 19 when they travel to
Columbus for the Ohio State
Invitational.
