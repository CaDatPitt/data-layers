Graham introduced as coach

New head coach will bring fast- pacedoffense, quality recruiting to Pitt football program”

Todd Graham was introduced to
the media Tuesday at the team’s

New Pitt head football coach Todd Graham, third from left, appearedlin his ﬁrst press conference as co

character, and he will recruit the
best class possible.

Graham, who was hired Mon-
day, comes to Pitt after posting
a 36-17 record in four seasons
as the head coach at Tulsa. He
capped’ off this season at the
Golden Hurricane with a 62-35
win over No. 24 Hawaii in the

Sheraton Hawaii Bowl.

The 46-year-old is Pitt’s third
head coach in a month, coming
right after Michael Haywood,
who was ﬁred about two weeks
after replacing former head coach
Dave Wannstedt.

“Coach Graham is a unique
college football coach. He’s a

proven winner through high

school and college football,” Pitt
athletic director Steve Pederson
said. “He’s creative, high energy
and he wants to win champion-
ships like we want to win cham-
pionships.” '

Under Graham, Tulsa teams

For The Pitt News

New football head coach Todd Gra-
ham will start his j ob with a relatively
warm reception as many students
say they’re looking forward to see-
ing a fresh face on the sidelines at
Heinz Field.

The positive sentiments come in
stark but welcome contrast to the
doubts that have clouded the foot-
ball program in recent days after the
resignation of one head coach and the
ﬁring of another, as well as harsh criti-

cism of Pitt’s athletic director Steve“-A

Pederson.

Juniors Matt Brosious and Vince
Williams both said they anticipate
that Graham will run a better, more
exciting offense than former head
coach Dave Wannstedt. Williams said
he was glad when he saw that Pitt had
hired Graham. P '

“'I‘ulsa’s beena good program for
the last few years,” he said, referring
to Graham’s last coaching stint.

During Graham’s run at Tulsa, the
team made many positive strides. In"

the last four seasons, Tulsa had a re-
cord of 36-17, and the team ﬁnished

Court sets trial date for Haywood  

The former football coach faces a domestic battery Charge, .a crime punishable by up to 3 years in prison if he ’s convicted

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staff Writer

Former Pitt football head coach Michael
Haywood appeared in an Indiana court
Tuesday morning for an initial hearing to
decide on future jury trial dates. ‘
According to an administrator injudge

Jane Woodward Miller’s office, March 10 is C

the official date for the trial. Haywood is

charged with domestic battery, a felony in
Indiana, where the alleged crime occurred.

. Haywood pleaded not guilty to the offense

earlier this month. ' '

Pitt’s decision to fire Haywood has cre-
ated a difficult situation not only for the
football team but for the university as a
whole. .‘

The team lost the majority of its pro-
spective recruits, and Pitt alumni have
threatened to withhold ﬁnancial dona-

tions if athletic director Steve Pederson
remains at the university.

Pitt’s coaching drama officially began-

on Dec. 7,, when another former head
coach, Dave Wannstedt, resigned under
pressure. The university hired Haywood
nine days later. About two weeks after
that, Pitt tired Haywood upon hearing he
had been arrested by policelon a “domes-
tic battery with child present” charge in
South Bend, Ind.

Haywood was taken to the St. Joseph '

Countyjail, where he remained for about
a day until he was released on $1,000
bond. .

His defense attorney, Andre'B. Gam-
mage, was out of the office on Tuesday and
unable to be reached for comment.

Haywood could face up to three years
in prison and a $10,000 ﬁne if convicted
on the charge, which is considered a class
D felony under Indiana law. I

The 2011 Student Government Board began
its ﬁrst meeting last night in Nordy’s Place
by highlighting some of its current plans for
upcoming year. V ' _. ,
Board member Ryan Gayman wants to
attend student ‘group meetings — if they’ll
have him. John Hasley wants a pictorial his-

- tory of the Oakland Zoo to decorate the walls

of the Eighth ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union.
James Landreneau wants more chatting on
Blackboard. And Alex Zimmerman wants ad-

ditional classes to count as general education

‘requirements. _ 7 -

But before they offered their solutions to
Pitt’s campus, new Board president Molly
Stieber made sure to start the meeting in a
very formal manner.

, With three quick whacks of the gavel, the
ﬁrst meeting of the 2011 "SGB was in-session.

Although only days into their term, the
Board members already had two items ofbusi-
ness on their agenda. They will vote on them
next Tuesday.

First, a revision to SGB’s bylaws. Former
president Charlie Shull began the process
during his term as Board president, Stieber
said. ‘ S

“Most are minor changes,” she said. “The
biggest additions involve the Code of Eth-
ics.” '

One of the changes assigns a Board mem-
ber to the Committee.Chairs to improve com-
munication between the two.

Stieber said the changes, should make it so
that all involved with the Board —, including

' Board president, members and committee

members —- are held‘ responsible fortheir
actions. _ . .
A document containing the changes is

. available in the SGB Ofﬁce on the eighth ﬂoor

of the William Pitt Union. Stieber saidshe was
also working to get the changes on the SGB
website for students to see. " . -

' The other order the Board will vote on 11
week is Resolution 0011 — a joint resolution

High hopes for Graham

tradition of Pitt”.

“When I walked into the room and got an
opportunity to meet the people here, the repre-

sentatives ofPitt, Iknew itwas a great ﬁtfor me. .

I’m deeply honored to be here,” he said.

. Another junior, Josh Glass, had a lot to say
about the Graham hiring. “While the move may
have seemed a bit desperate at ﬁrst,,it’s really
the only move Pitt had,” Glass said.

how long Graham will stay at the university.

“I think he’s probably usingthis job more as
a stepping stone for future opportunities than
as a long—term deal,” Leckie said.

LeckiesaidthatGraham’shistorywithTulsa 6‘

is impressive, and that Pitt’s program can only
go up from last year, so he looks forward to an
exciting season. .

News of the football hire is still new around
campus. Many students remained unaware of

While the move may have seemed
desperate at first, it’s really the
only move Pitt had. i

Glass, like many other students, is impressed
with Graham’s numbers at Tulsa and said that
his coaching styles and strategies could really
help ayoung Pitt team. 1

. “His offensive scheme could potentially help i

Tino Sunseri mature,-as well as improve a Pitt
offense that was sluggish much of this year,”
Glass said. ’ 6

Though many are very optimistic about the '

coming season, some students still have their
reservations. Sophomore Brian Leckie said he is
interested to see what Graham can do with the
team next year, especially since the Panthers

are losing star playersjon Baldwin, Dion Lewis,

and Hen1y_Hynoski — considered by many to

be Pitt’s three primary offensive weapons —— to
.the NFL draft.

But Leckie was also skeptical, wondering

the program’s new leadership, while others con— _

tinued to read up on Graham, saying that they
didn’t know much about the new coach except
for his recent accomplishments in Tulsa.

A large group of students still seemed
amazed at the controversy surrounding the-
Michael Haywood ﬁring. Others reported still

harboring mistrust for th'e football program, ’

seeing the Graham hire mainly as an attemptto
make up for the school’s recent drama.
Regardless, most students who were inter-

. viewed agreedthatPittlandedap1ime candidate

for its vacant head coaching position. Many said
they were conﬁdent that Graham will turn the
program around. _

Pitt doctors granted more than $20 million

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staff Writer

Two doctors from the University of Pitts-
burgh Medical Center received two of four
national, multi-million—dollar contracts
from the National Institutes of Health to
study antibiotic resistance.

Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the Chil-
dren’s Hospital of UPMC received an $8.2
million contract for the study of ear infec-
tions in children, and Dr. Victor Yu received
a contract for $14.9 million for the study of
pneumonia diagnosis. '

Yu, a professor in Pitt’s Department of
Medicine, will conduct a study in conjunc-
tion with six other institutes in the United
States and abroad. The $14.9 million will
be divided between Pitt and the other in-
stitutions. .

The National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, a part of the National
Institutes of Health, chose the recipients of
the contracts from several who applied and
will supply the funds in increments.

“Antibiotic resistance is a very high-
priority area for the NIAID,” said Farukh
Khambaty, project ofﬁcer at the NIAID. The
contract awardees were selected “based
on the quality of the science and the public
health relevance,” he said.

In the past, bacteria and other microbes
resistant to antibiotics were not of great
concern because new drugs could effectively
combat the bacteria, said Hoberman, chief of
the Division of General Academic Pediatrics
at Children’s Hospital. Over time, however,
some forms of bacteria built up resistances
to existing antibiotics.

The concern is now worldwide, Kham—

Farukh Khambaty:

fewer antibiotics would be required, reduc-
ing the chance that bacteria could develop
resistance.

“Every time [children in the study] have
an ear infection, they will be treated with
either a short duration treatment strategy
or standard duration treatment strategy
and that will be in a blind fashion,” Hober-
man said.

Antibiotic resistance is a very high
priority for the NIAID.

baty said.

Hoberman’s contract deals with car in-
fections in children, a very common ailment,
he said.

“Ear infections are the most frequently
diagnosed illness in children in the United
States. It’s the most common reason for
children to receive an antibiotic,” Hober-
man said.

His study will investigate whether treat-
ment time for ear infections can be halved.
The typical treatment time frame, after chil-
dren began receiving antibiotics, is 10 days.
If treatment proves effective in ﬁve days,

The study will involve 600 children
over a projected four-year span and will be
conducted mainly in Pittsburgh. There is
an afﬁliated research site for the study in
Pennsylvania, as well as one in Kentucky,
he said.

Hoberman will also investigate if the pre-
scribed antibiotic can limit the recurrence
of ear infections by eliminating lingering,
resistant bacteria.

“It’s important not only that you treat
and cure the ear infection, but also that the
likelihood of you harboring resistant organ-
isms in the back of the nose after treatment

is the same or lower,” Hoberman said.

Yu’s contract relates to the study of di-
agnosis and treatment of pneumonia, the
number-one cause of infection-related death
in the world, he said.

After years of treating pneumonia with
a common type of antibiotic, bacteria and
other microbes had an easier time devel-
oping resistance. Doctors have too often
relied on a powerful, one-size-ﬁts-all type of
antibiotic rather than using varied, speciﬁc
types of antibiotics, he said.

“Doctors have gotten into the habit  as

‘ soon as they think it’s pneumonia to take out
the cannonball,” Yu said.

Yu’s study will seek to examine and iden-
tify the speciﬁc microbes causing pneumonia
in a patient so that more speciﬁc, narrowed
types of antibiotics can be applied.

The study aims to examine 6,000 par-
ticipants across the seven institutions. The
study is projected to take four years. To make
the proper diagnosis to decide treatment,
Yu plans to incorporate older and newer
diagnosis methods such as a gram stain test,
which stains a microbe for clearer viewing,
and a molecular test known as polymerase
chain reaction.

Depending on the results of the study,
older “carmonball” drugs such as penicillin
could be brought back if antibiotic resistance
can be controlled. I

Board rejects

golden

hen we feel wronged
by certain people, it’s
only natural that we
might hesitate before recogniz-
ing legitimate, sincere changes
in their behavior.
Take the College Board.
Many of us who survived ——
scratch that — took AP courses
in high school continue to shud-
der when forced to consider No.
2 pencils, barcode labels and
shrink-wrapped exam booklets
during the ﬁrst weeks of May.
The vast majority of those who
went through the AP system don’t
exactly applaud it as a transfor-
mative educational experience.
But as entrenched in Ameri-
can education as AP is, we ought
to recognize a College Board
achievement when we see one.
If we are to hold -the College
Board to its new AP course over-
haul plan outlined this week in
a New York Times article, then
the nonprofit deserves some
praise, as hard as it might be to

' dole out.

According the article, the
board, which owns the AP exams,
is beginning to revamp its tests
so that the respective courses
stress critical thinking instead
of rote memorization. The board
traditionally provides teachers of
AP courses with a long, ambigu-
ous list of concepts that could
show up on the exams. Now, it
is not only slashing some mate-
rial as part of its new plan, it’s
providing detailed standards for
each subject. Revisions to the AP
biology and U.S. history courses
will go into effect by the fall of
2012, and the physics, chemistry,

calf  

European history, world history
and art history curricula will fol-
low suit by 2015.

The fact that the College Board
is setting more deﬁned boundar-
ies for AP courses might sound
restricting, but in fact, in the AP
environment, added structure is
added freedom. As research in
the ﬁelds on which the College
Board tests has exploded in the
past half-century, rapidly wid-
ening the range of subjects that
could make it into exam ques-

tions, teachers are increasingly .

forced to shift their focus to the
end goal. What we think of as
educational mainstays — like
student attainment, in-depth
analysis and critical ‘thinking
— fall limp and atrophy in fa-
vor of the newly valued priority
of speed. _

But speed is the golden calf
of teaching, a false deity that
we’re thrilled the College Board
is ﬁnally relinquishing. If the
board actually clariﬁes its re-
quirements of teachers over the
next few years, we can easily
predict that students enrolled
in AP classes will get more out
of them. With refurbished AP
courses that Trevor Packer, Col-
lege Board’s vice president for
Advanced Placement, described
in the article as focusing “on
what students need to be able
to do with their knowledge,” edu-
cators can design their classes
to consider issues in true, ap-
preciable depth.

Because worrying over los-
ing ﬁve minutes here or there is

. one way to run a barracks,°not a

classroom. I

00 days of America

‘ Andrew Kaback
Columnist

(277) Well, it’s done. I’ve had
the talk with America. You see,
I’m studying abroad and going
to spend the next four months
in London. Yes, it was hard to
do, but it was time. We’ve been
through a lot together and no
one understands me like America
did. Listen, it wasn’t America, it
was me! I didn’t appreciate the
apple pies and free buffets, the
blockbuster movies and the real-
ity TV shows. rm just not ready
to be married already; I mean
I’m a young guy... ,
(1) You could say that it was
love at first sound. America was
playing The Smiths in the ele-
vator where we met, and I was
hooked from there. I watched
that ﬁrst pitch at Fenway Park,
saw that ball drop to bring in
the new year, male gazed at the
skimpiest Halloween animal cos-
tumes that Third World coun-
tries can make and never wanted
anything more. I felt like Michael

Cera in a movie about teenage
awkwardness — it was just right.
I could see myself getting fat and
moving to Florida to live out my
days as a retiree voting against
everything.

(56) You see America had
never really let anyone get close
to it. Sure Mexico and Canada
hang out all the time, but out-

side of a littleﬂing way back in .

1812, the United States has been
pretty emotionally isolated. Oh,
I know all about the one—night

only reason America went back
to Iraq was because it left its wal-
let on the bedstand. Besides, it’s
not like America is even into that
whole masochistic stuff that they
do. And please, Grenada was so
20 years ago. I’m the only one
that it really got close _to. You

I got when we first hooked up.

It’s like dating a supermodel,

but instead of long legs it has
fast food restaurants. It’s come
a long way from Ben Franklin

Founding Fathers could be alive

status “It’s Complicated with Sal-
ly Hemings” for Thomas Jeffer-

Burr can suck it” from Alexander
Hamilton. Seeing America grow
up, it’s like parenting. I feel like
actor Will Smith watching people
whip their hair back and forth.

that this proves, it’s that Americans

A thrilling eomeback of its own.  

wondering how you can get in on
some of this sweet comeback action.
As always, we have the answers and
are more than happy to share.

First of all, you’re going to need to

i take a great fall. As evidenced by the
universal scorn heaped upon pret~-

tyboy quarterback Peyton Manning,
people just can’t bring themselves to

getbehind anybody who stairs on top "

and stays there. No, you’re going to
have to drop to the bottom and then
work your way back up in some kind
of impressive fashion. We’ll leave it to

you to ﬁgure out what works for you
and what doesn’t on that score.

After you’ve returned to the top,
you must milk your 15 minutes of
fame for all that they’re worth. Even
if you haven’t learned anythingfrom
your ordeal, you would be wise to
gush about how you’ve matured and
developedanew respectforyourself.
People, especially Oprah, love hear-
ing that sort of stuff.

Once you’re ﬁrmly in the spot-
light, you should either try to keep
ascending or make plans for yet

* another fall and rise. Although you

might think that a single rebirth is
all the public can handle, the careers
of seemingly ineradicable celebri-
ties like Cher,_]ohn Tesh and Geraldo
Rivera ought to cause you to think
otherwise. The key here is to not
do anything so egregious that you
can’t come back, a la the gone and
completely forgotten former Sen.

‘ John Edwards.

The big problem with all this
coming back stuff is that, unlike an
Introduction to Psychology course

' or Call of Duty 3, it requires that you

do actual work. However, if you’re‘

a willing to take a risk, there is a good

way around that — you can simply
make up the tragic event from which
you’re rebounding. '

Noted authorjames Frey, who is
way richer than we are, did this and
even managed to fool the legendary
Oprah inthe process. His story, which
didn’t make a bit of sense, managed
to liftthe hearts of millions of people
who are undoubtedly still anticipat-
ing comebacks of their own.

Whether you’re visiting a neigh-
borhood that’s being gentriﬁed or
watching a former movie star try
to jumpstart his or her ailing career
through a guest appearance on a
sitcom, you’ can’t deny the power of
the comeback. The best way to get
started is by starting over, so focus on
making 2011 the year that you beat
all of the odds and begin working
on the evens.

Wagner says farewell to four influential musicians

During 2010, Ronnie James Dio, Jay Reatard, Malcolm McLaren and Captain Beefheart died. Wagne'r.d_iscusses their legacies. '

Many people worldwide have
been impacted by the untimely
loss of individuals likejohn Len-

loss isn’t a former Beatle, guitar
god or punk rock warlord, such
tragedies might seem to get lost
in the musical space where sound
turns to echo.

With every passing year, the
sad reality of the music (or any)
industry is that people impor-
tant in the field die. This past
year, four important musicians
— Ronniejames Dio,]ay Reatard,

Malcolm McLaren and Captain

ALBUM REVIEW

Broken Records crafts cohesive CD

- Bnoken Records
_ _A;LetMe Come Home

Rocks Like: The National
Grade: A-

Broken Records made avalid attempt to work its
way into the indie rock spotlight with its newest
release, Let Me Come Home. I

The six—piece band, formed in2o07, has made

some serious ground. With two EPs, ahandﬁil of
singles and a previous album already produced,
this indie rock band from Edinburgh, Scotland,
continues to prove its potentialwithLetMe Come
Home, released yesterday.
The album is ﬁlled with Jamie Sutherland’s
deep and soulfulvoice. The dark and heavy sound
includes the expected guitars, bass and drums, as
well as apiano and violin. Each song incorporates
the instruments fully and inwonderﬁilly synced
collaboration.

Let Me Come Home has both fast and slow
tempos that give the album afair balance. Though
the group’s sound is somewhat similar to other,
better—known indie bands’ like The Nau'onal’s,
Broken Records has done a good job ofhighlight—
ing its strengths — like varied inst1'umentat1'on

and the use ofboth male and female voices. The
band has showcased its over—arching sound con-
sistently throughout the album, makingLet Me

The album begins with “A Leaving Song”
and ends with “Home,” taking the listener on a
joumeywhere the music all strings togetherwell
and ends onasolid note. Tracks such as “Dia dos
Namarados!” containamore romantic sound and
soft appeal, whereas others like “Aliene” are more
intense, accented by both guitar and violin.
Broken Records has proved it can produce
a CD to hold its own and has potential for a suc-
cessful future. The band starts its tourinthe U.K.
later this month and will hop the Atlantic for an
American tour in February.

to try to make serious money off of the
seemingly nihilist genre. ,

Beyond these contributions to guitar-
based music, McLaren helped popularize
hip-hop in the United Kingdom with the
‘release of his single “Buffalo Gals,” which
was also a minor hitin the United States.
McLaren was always a controversial for
supposedly ripping off bands and trying
to wield power with an iron fist, but he
was always a notablefigure.

In ‘classics, like Trout Mask Replica and
his. debut, Safe as_Milk,- Beefheart em-
bodied the frenzied power that music can

develop when you don’t approach it from
- a conventional direction. ' -

He deconstructed blues in a way that
both respected the f'orm’s integrity and
allowed it to absorb the ‘diverse styles of
the late 1960s. The track “Safe as Milk,”
for example — considered one of Beef—_
heart’s more “conventional” works —;fea—
tures two slide guitars and a rhythm more
hypnotic than the free—associativ.e warble
coming from Beefheart’s lips. “I may be
hungry but I sure ain’t weird,” he moans

on the.track while dissociative taps are i

heard in the background. .. .
Each of these people, along with count-
less others, contributed greatly to our
modern forms of heavy metal, punk rock,
hip-hop and urban blues,

are no longer with us, but I am happy that

they lived in our time and will continue

to live "through headphones for time to

background stories. There is a greater em—
phasis on Mr. Banks’ (Laird Mackintosh)
tendency to overwork and his strained
relationship with his wife (Blythe Wilson).
This adds depth to the production, giving

so absent from the children’s lives when he
speaks fondly of his nanny Miss Andrew
(Ellen Harvey) who taught him about order
and later cowers from her when she arrives
in a puff of black smoke. '

Miss Andrew might be the biggest
change to the plot, and her character is
an excellent juxtaposition to the neat-but-

kind paragon of perfection, Mary Poppins -

(Caroline Sheen). When the two women
sing. and act together, their powerful vo-
cals and conflicting characteristics work
together to create points of tension both
musically and in the plot. i

As for changes to the musical num-
bers, the mouthful of a song “Supercali-

’ fragilisticexpialidocious” is set in Mrs.

Corry’s (Q. Smith) conversation shop. Full
‘of vividly colored, fanciful costumes and
precise choreography, it still hearkens
back to the cartoonish movie version with
an extra yet plot-relevant touch of whimsy.
It’s really a matter of whether the viewer

. can stomach such a departure from the

original.

Arguably, the most lively and endearing
character is Bert (Nicolas Dromard). The
heartwarming odd jobs-man and chim-
ney sweep serves as the pivotal character,
moving a set_ component dramatically, to
transition between scenes or reprising his
catchy “Chim Chim Cher—ee3’ ~

The show ‘pointedly explores the love
story between Bert and Mary Poppins more
than the ﬁlm, though not as a main plot
focus. The production hints that Bert and
Mary are a couple, but there is _a subtle
longing apparent throughout the show.
It becomes apparent that this is because
Mary is bound to go where she is needed,
leaving Bert behind.

This romantic entanglement rounds out
Mary’s character, keeping ‘her from seem-

ing uppity after her “Practically Perfect”
number. Admittedly, it does add a twinge of
heartache to an otherwise upbeat show.
For the ﬁnale, Mary Poppins soars
above the audience gripping her signa-

' . ture.bird—handled umbrella as the Bankses

discuss their newfound functionality — a
somewhat cheesy, yet stunning and heart-
warming ending.

tenderness all over the place, but not just for the

When the Pitt men’s basketball
team tips off against the George-
town Hoyas tonight, it will mark
the team’s toughest road test of
the season to date.

"‘-* Though the Hoyas are on a

bit of a cold streak, losing three
of their last four games, the Pan-
thers’ second true road game at

7 p.m. at the Verizon Center will

still be a tough one.
Georgetown, currently ranked
C No. 22 in the country (12—4, 1-3 Big
East), is coming off a tough loss to

hit the road to face Georgetown

the West Virginia Mountaineers,
meaning the team is starving for
a win. Meanwhile, the Panthers
come into the game on a ﬁve-game
winning streak since suffering a
loss to Tennessee back on Dec.
11.

Since that loss, No. 5 Pitt (15—1,
3-0 Big East) has won ﬁve straight
games, including big wins over
Connecticut and Marquette. Along
the way, they’ve tinkered with the
lineup, moving forward Nasir
Robinson back into the starting
ﬁve.

Robinson missed theseasons’
ﬁrst three games with a knee inju-
ry, and remained on the Panthers’

bench until returning to the start-
ing lineup against Connecticut

“He deﬁnitely brings a lot of

Against Marquette on Satur-
day, Robinson started again but
saw limited time and ﬁnished with
nine points and three assists.

Along with Robinson, in-
creased production has been
seen from allgof the Panthers’
big men. Notably, Gary McGhee

THROWING A KIRSCHBALL

 

Hiring Graham the right choice

Todd Graham addresses the media yesterday at a press conference a

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

 

_Ever since former head coach Dave Wannstedt
resigned under pressure, the Pitt football pro-
gram has been consumed by a public relations
nightmare. _ ' A

Pitt’s ﬁrst choice to replace Wannstedt,
Michael Haywood, was charged with domes-
tic battery shortly after his hiring. Pitt ﬁred
him just over 24 hours after the incident oc-
curred. (Haywood later pleaded not guilty to
his charge.)

A nationally ranked and once-promising
recruiting class was dismantled, leaving only
ﬁve committed recruits.

Wannstedt announced he wouldn’t coach

the Panthers in the BBVA Compass Bowl and 5

even as it took place, Pitt focused on ﬁnding the
next head coach for its football program.

But here’s some good news: Pitt got it right
this time when it hired former Tulsa head
coach Todd Graham to take over the team.
And in case you’re one of the people who had
your heart set on another coach, like Penn
State’s defensive coordinator Tom Bradley,
I’m going to tell you why.

Bradley seemed to be the most popular and

supported choice around Pittsburgh,‘ mainly

because he’s a well-liked and well-respected
coach in Western Pennsylvania, and for good
reason. ‘ ‘

But unlike Bradley, Graham has head- I

coaching experience. Bradley’s been an assis-
tant underjoe Paterno for more than 30 years.
Graham’s been the head coach at two different
programs, and both have been successful.

Graham spent four seasons as Tu1sa’s head
coach, compiling a 36—17 overall record. At
the end of this season, the Golden Hurricane
defeated No. 24 Hawaii 62-25 in the Sheraton
Hawaii Bowl. He’s the only Tulsa head coach
to post consecutive 10-win seasons — and he
did so his ﬁrst two years at the helm.

He led a turnaround as the head coach at
Rice University in 2005, when he guided the
Owls to a7-6 record and their ﬁrst bowl berth
in 45 years. He was named the Conference USA
Coach of the Year following the season.

Graham also worked under Rich Rodriguez
at West Virginia, where the Mountaineers im-
proved from 3-8 to 9-4 in his second season.
He was the defensive coordinator at Tulsafrom
2003-05. \

During those years, Tulsa ranked among
the top 25 in pass defense, third in takeaways
and interceptions and 11”‘ in pass-defense ef-

Ryan Samson I Staff Photographer

t the football team’s practice facility in the South Side. It
was his ﬁrst public appearance as Pitt’s new head coach.

A ﬁciency.

In 2002, the Golden Hurricane went 1-11.
After Graham’s arrival, they went 8-4..

Wherever Graham goes, programs seem
to be resurrected. But here’s the best news:
Pitt’s program doesn’t need to be resurrected.
Even withjon Baldwin, Dion Lewis and Henry
Hynoski declaring for the NFL draft, the Pan-
thers still haveplenty of talent. Wannstedt built
astrong foundation, and now it’s up to Graham
to take the team to the next level.

I think he’s the man to do it.

All the Panthers need is some direction
and stability: someone to utilize all thattalent.
That’s something Graham can certainly offer.
His history of head coaching success is a lot
more impressive than that of Haywood, who
led his own turnaround at Miami (Ohio) but re-
ally had nothing else to show for his career.

Also, Pitt fans will probably have to ﬁnd
something else to complain about during
Graham’s time as Pitt’s head coach, because
the offense won’t be boring or stagnant. The

Panthers can say goodbye to the pro-style of- 4 T

fense and get ready to welcome one that’s more
up-tempo. '

There will be some high-scoringBackyard
Brawls to look forward to between Graham at
Pitt and Dana Holgorsen at West Virginia.

Hoyas slump heading
into game against Pitt

Nasir Robinson and the Panthers will face Georgetown at the Verizon Center tonight at
7. Robinson has played well since being inserted into the starting lineup Dec. 27.

have been offensive. Pitt currently leads
the nation in rebounding.

- As for Georgetown, the Hoyas are’ ice
cold. With back-to-back losses to unranked

teams (St. John’s and West Virginia), the

Hoyas are falling fast.

On one_side of things, nothing is working
for Georgetown. Yet they are still the No.
22 team in the country and are sure to be
hungry for a win to end their losing skid.

Georgetown’s man to watch will be Aus-
tin Freeman. Freeman, a senior guard who
stands at 6-foot-3, is averaging 17.9 points
per game this year. If he gets going, the
Panthers could be in trouble.

Back in November, Freeman had back-
to-back 30,-point games, one of them a
win in which the Hoyas scored 111 points
against Missouri.

Another strong guard for the Hoyas
is senior Chris Wright. Wright, who has a

history of strong showings in big games,
has had double-digit assists three times
this year. He is averaging 12.5 points and
5.9 assists per game.

With the strong play of Gibbs and Brad
Wanamaker this season, the guard matchup
in Wednesday’s game should be intriguing.
After a nice win on Saturday, the Panthers
have no time to rest.

The strength of Georgetown’s schedule
has prepared them to play tough opponents
this year, and Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
recognizes the challenge for the Panthers
coming off a win against another good team
in Marquette.

“We just had a good win and now we go
on the road to play the No. 1 team in RPI,
Georgetown, on Wednesday,” Dixon said
after the win over Marquette. “This confer-
ence has been pretty good the last couple
years, by far the best in the country.” I

New assistants”
announced T  

Graham< 14

Graham said he will immediatelyibegin
recruiting in hopes of notmerely salvaging
the recruiting class but of ensuring that
it’s strong. a if V

“I believe we will put together one of the
finest recruiting classes ever,” he said. “As
I walked through this campus and walked
down these halls, the opportunity to do
that is just phenomenal.” ‘

To do this, Graham will enlist his pri- —

mary core of assistant coaches, many of

_whom he introduced Tuesday.

' He will ﬁll out the rest of the coaching
staff in time, but reiterated that recruiting
is his first priority right now.

Helpingto court players will be associ-
ate head coach Paul Randolph, who will
work with the defensive line; Keith Pat-
terson who will work with defense; Mike
Norvell and Calvin McGee, who will co-
coordinate the offense; and Tony Gibson,
who will work with the defensive backs and
serve as the recruiting coordinator.

All of the coaches have backgrounds at
either Michigan, West Virginia or Tulsa.

“Coach Gibson will be out in Western
Pennsylvania in a hurry,” Graham said. “We
know that there are some great players
in this state. We will work hard on win—
ning this state; I think that is very im-
portant.”

Graham noted that his primary goals
are to promote high character, ensure that

players graduate and transform the Pan- ~
thers into champions not only of the Big

East but of the nation.

“The number one thing in our system .

is speed and explosive power. I would list
speed three times, .and then explosive
power,” he said. “We want to be fast, we
want to be efﬁcient and we are going to
be explosive.”

Graham said he plans to meet with for-
mer Pitt players Jon Baldwin, Dion Lewis
and Henry Hynoski, all of whom declared

their intentions to enter the NFL draft,

Monday.

The new head coach hopes to persuade
them to return to school.

“I would love to have those guys. Watch-
ing their prowess offensively and the tal-
ents that they have, I would love to have the
opportunity to "sell them on the offense,”
he said. “Naturally, I believe this offense

would do nothing but enhance their status

in the future.”

Graham noted that academics an_d the
school’s rich tradition are two things that
enticed him to accept the offer to become
the school’s next head football coach.

Pitt officials did not release the terms
of Graham’s contract, though some outlets
have reported that his contract could be
worth $2 million per season. .

Graham should improve Panthers offense

Kirschman < 15

Offensively, Graham’s teams are exciting. In
2007 and 2008,the Golden Hurriance boasted
the nation’s top—ranked offense. It averaged

C 543.9 and 569.9 yards per game, respectively.

This year, Tulsa was ﬁfth in total offense, av-
eraging 504.89 yards per game.

The Golden Hurricane scored more than
40 points eight times last season. Pitt scored
more than 40 points three times.

There’s also potential for Graham to
broaden Pitt’s recruiting horizons, as he was
