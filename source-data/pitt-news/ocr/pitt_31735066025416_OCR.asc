Discussion
about Why

What little boys learn from
their parents may be making
them into rapists. And what
little girls learn may be help-
ing them become rape vic-

Stopping Rape discussion last

Learning said.

“You can’t stop rape with
more policemen and putting
more men in jail. We have to
change the message we get as
males growing up,” co—speak—
er Greg Meitus told 15 male
students, mostly members of
fraternities. _

Meitus, Majchael Tajchman
and Chris Colborn led the
informal meeting, which
focused on what men can do
to help stop rape. According

and Russel, one-third of
women in this country are
raped.

As children, males learn that
the most important thing
about being a man is having
sex and playing rough.
Society teaches males that

order to solidify your man-
hood,” Tajchman, a graduate

Read then recycle,
but not on campus

By Rebecca Baker
‘Staff Writer

Although the University of
Pittsburgh has facilities to
recycle computer paper, col-
ored paper and beverage
cans, there is no place to
recycle newspapers on cam-
pus. ,

“The only students that can
recycle newspapers are the
ones that have the City of
Pittsburgh take it away,” Pitt’s
Recycling Coordinator for
Facilities Management Bob
Boyce said. “The city doesn’t
take papers from the universi-

ty because we’re a commer-
cial institution.” '

According to Boyce, no mar-
ket exists for recycling news-
papers in Pittsburgh because
Pennsylvania doesn’t have a
state-run de-inking plan that
removes the print from the
paper. “Before Pittsburgh
started recycling newsprint,
the city was paid $3 a ton for

their recyclables, like plastic ‘

and glass. Now the city has to

pay $2 a ton because newspa-

per paper is bulky and not

worth much,” Boyce said.

UPMC recognized as number one

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
Transplantation Program is the most active
organ transplant center in the United States,
according to a recent survey.

The survey, conducted by Stadtlanders
Pharmacy Lifetime Program, ranked the 10
most active transplant centers in the country.
UPMC ranked first with 736 organ transplants
in 1991. ’ A

Our counseling center staff
and, especially, our learning
skills specialists frequently
work with students who are
unhappy with their academic
performance.

It is not unusual to have
students say that they can’t
understand how some of their
friends, who don’t seem any
brighter than they are, consis-
tently get better grades.
This observation has some
validity.

We have frequently noted
wide discrepancies incollege
grades among students who
have similar college board
scores or lQs.

Often these discrepancies
can be explained by different
work ethics. One student
works and then parties, while
another parties and then par-
ties some more.

Frequently, however, there
may be other reasons for
the discrepancies in perfor-

some very specific reading
and study skills possessed
by some students but not by
others. I will talk more about
these skills in a future article.

For now, I will offer a
rather broad bit of advice.

mance, I suggest that you pay
attention to the study habits
of your friends who are get-
ting good grades. '

Students who struggle with
their college work tend to
assume that successful
students are either “brains,”
study “nerds” or that they
cheat.

‘These assumptions may be
true in some cases". I have
observed, however, that most
good students do a number
of very practical things that
make them successful.

They attend lectures, sit up
front, ask questions and
take good notes. Outside of
the classroom they rewrite
I their notes, follow a study
plan and use mnemonic
devices to remember diffi-
cult material.

When they begin to experi-
ence problems, they are
quick_ to take advantage of
available tutors or teaching

take advantage of programs
at the Learning Skills Center
or the writing workshop, and
they have learned a few
tricks over the years on how
to read more efficiently and
how to prepare for both
objective and essay exams.
None of these strategies
are all that innovative nor do

they require great intellectual J

powers to carry them out.

Yet, most students that
I have known over the years
who utilize these kinds
of tactics are invariably
successful.

So if you want to be a top
student, imitate one. It’s a
sure-fire strategy for success.

you would like to see
addressed in a future column
or a question send it to:

Pitt’s Heinz Chapel Choir
could perform for the Pope
if it ever decides to follow
up its tour of Eastern
Europe.

According to John
Goldsmith, director of the
Heinz Chapel ‘Choir, they

. were in Krakow when they
were told by a former aide
to the Pope that if the
choir ever came back to
Europe, a concert for his
Holiness could be
arranged. _

The tour, which included
stops in Germany, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Austria and Switzerland,
lasted 21 days, beginning
April 27 and ending May
17.

“We felt it was a great
time to go over and tour
Eastern Europe because it
had just opened to the
west, there—was just so
much to see,” he said.

The entire tour cost
$200,000, but the choir

Goldsmith said.

“There was lots of variety
in the concert. There were
folk songs, spirituals and a
lot of things to keep the
crowd extremely satisfied,”
he said. '

The

choir visited

Auschwitz while they were

in Germany.

“To see what happened
was a terribly sobering
experience. Lots of tears
were shed by members of
the choir when they saw
what happened to all those
people there,” he said.

Goldsmith said
Prague was the most beau-
tiful city that the choir
visited, the concert was
recorded there in St.
Klemenz Cathedral.

The people in Europe
were friendly, Goldsmith
said.

The biggest problem the
choir had during the trip
was when 29 members lost
their luggage in Berlin.

According to Goldsmith,
the whole;tour was. a
positive experience for the
choir.

said. "They came back with -

The Marine Spill Response

$100,000 grant to start a program
to evaluate the effectiveness and
safety of other companies’ oil-

Bioremediation is the term
used to describe products or
processes which enhance and
accelerate how naturally-occur-

For example, when oil is

PISO strives for C2/zltumll awareness

By Rachael DeVine
For Ibe Pitt News

The Pitt International Student
Organization may sound like it
is only open to international
students, but the theme of the

' ’ new year is “cultural awareness

for all.”

While the club focuses its
efforts on giving comfort to
international students, it found
that having American students
involved in the group to be
culturally insightful. '

Aslan Al-barazi, president of

the organization, said, “I am
happy to have American stu-
dents being aware of other cul-
tures.”

He believes it is important for
the members of the organiza-
tion to interact with other orga-
nizations on campus. V

Al—barazi and PISO Vice
President Ana Maria Mieles
both believe that by having an
“outsiders view” around cam-
pus can help broaden perspec-
tives of all students.

The group has guest speakers
who talk about other countries,
but Al-barazi is hoping that the
members of the organization
will also participate as speak-
ers. He believes that once the
internal strength is there the
organization will be able to
have a strong voice.

“It will make the group more

C powerful,” Al-barazi said._

PISO has also involved
Carnegie Mellon, Point Park
and Duquesne in some of its
programs.

Making international students
comfortable on campus is just
part of the job,for this year’s
PISO, Al—barazi said.

He said it is important for the
students to see more than just
Pittsburgh.

“So many international stu-
dents see only the university
campus, and we want to
change that,” Mieles said. The
leaders have planned a Niagara
Falls trip to let students see
more than just the city of
Pittsburgh. 0

“More than Indian woman
specifically, I am concerned
with people identifying with

Parasher said.’ There is a

The immigrant woman loses
her identity because she is
forced to form an identity
based on the roles she must

Parasher said, “ she is
depending on someone, even
for the immigration.” V

Parasher said she came

to the United States as a stu- ‘

dent. She received her mas-

SAC addresses agenda

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Investigating both the maternity-leave policy and the
crosswalk between the Cathedral and Union is onthis year’s
agenda of the Staff Association Council.

All faculty members have a paid six week maternity or
sick leave and staff members do not. SAC officers said they
plan to investigate the issue.

On campus, the organization is concerned about the ille-
gal crosswalk between the Student Union and the Cathedral
of Learning. According to Rich Calwell, director of the safety
and security committee of the SAC, someone from Pitt puts
the crosswalk there year after year.

“There’s no signs telling anybody it’s there, so if [a vehi-
cle] doesn’t see it, then you’re crossing in the middle of a
block,” Calwell said. ,

He said he investigated the possibility of placing a sign at
the crosswalk warning drivers to watch for pedestrians, but
since the city didn’t paint the crosswalk, they_ refuse to
install the sign. “There are other illegal crosswalks on cam-
pus, but that’s the worst one. At least this year they painted
it the right color,” he said.

Within the SAC, officers said revisions of the group’s by-
laws and press release pieces need to be settled. A new
committee that researches other university staff association
councils was established.

performed in 1991. _

The 10 transplant centers performed a total of 3,512 trans-
plants in 1991. This is 22 percent of all transplants per-
formed in the United States, according to Stadtlanders.

“Behind each of these patient numbers is a story of great
human courage and triumph," President of Stadtlanders
Lifetime pharmacy program, Gregg Perelman, said.

The survey points out the critical need for organ donors.

“...More than 26,000 children and adults are currently
waiting for transplants,” Perelman said. ‘ ’ '

The media was also dis-
cussed as a perpetuator of the
myth that rape by an acquain-
tance is not the same as a
rape by a stranger because it
is categorized as “date rape.”
Rape is rape, panelists said.

“There is the same amount
of force in date rape as so-
called stranger rape,” Meitus
said.

Meitus also told the group
that he hoped each male at
the discussion would not go
along with their fraternity
brothers who make sexist
remarksf

“There is too much silence
on the issue of rape — stand
up in front of your brothers,”
Meitus, who quit a Purdue
University fraternity when he
found out that four of his
fraternity brothers had raped

an intoxicated girl who
had passed out at a party,
said.

“Alcohol is not an excuse to
rape,” Colborn said.

Chris Forney, an English

four of his fraternity brothers

fraternity life.”

“It makes you think about
it,” Forney said after the dis-
cussion.

Stocks, who is a new mem-
ber of the Provost Advisory

Concerns, said that the uni-
versity needs to find more
creative ways to talk about
these things with men.

“And if necessary  make

said.

The Boy's Club

The United States’ armed forces hold more than a
large degree of responsibility. Aside from providing for
the security and well-being of ourcitizens, they are
also the federal government’s largest single employer.
As such then, the military has both a large direct and

indirect inﬂuence on hiring practices throughout the ‘

country. _

Their treatment of homosexuals, and most recently
women, proves that they still have a long way to go.

A week ago Thursday, as reported by The New Yorle
Times, a Pentagon report made public said that Navy
officials deliberately sabotaged their own investigation
to avoid negative publicity. The investigation, which
was undermined by several high-ranking officers, dealt

with the assault of 26 women, including 14 officers, at

the Tailhook Association Convention in Las Vegas.

This incident raises several very important ethical
concerns about the U.S. Navy. The first, and most obvi-
ous one, is the treatment of women in the military.

Secondly, one must wonder, without the proper -
accountability, how often the military sabotages its‘

own investigations t_o avoid negative publicity.

Acting Navy Secretary Sean O’Keefe recently
announced several structural changes which would
keep incidents like thisone from occurring in the
future. The changes include, among others — broader
civilian control and the restructuring of the Navy’s
-investigative agencies. __ ..

Regardless of what kind of superﬁcial policy changes
the Navy makes, until it starts~treating women how
they should be treated — in the same fashion as men

“ —— nothing will ever drastically change.

Yes, this does mean that the military will have to stop
defining what women can and cannot do in combat.
Most individuals join the military for the right to fight

' for their country. Women are no different and thus

must be given the same opportunities as men. If this
means ﬂying missions and anything else, then so be it.

y This is the only thing that can change the attitudes

that many military men have towards ‘women. For

those people who think that women don’t have the

I

"capacity to serve in combat, stop perpetuating the

myth. We have yet to hear of a study that says women

“ are not as capable as men when it comes to ﬂying mis-

sions. . .

The American military has been, and always will be,

. looked to for providing leadership. Having said that, it

is about time that they change their discriminatory
policies towards women, homosexuals and minorities.
As an entity which has much inﬂuence in the world,

. responsibility on the part of the military could start the

ball rolling towards changes throughout the rest of
society.

I got a phone call from my

help.

“I got into a political argu-

class, and I got killed,”_ she
said.

I asked her what the problem
was, and groaned when I heard

. the response. It seems that

among the other misconcep-

have, they believe that the
Republican Party is racist.

Now if it were just a bunch

‘children listening to their mis-

I also. tend to believe that the
Democratic Party as a whole is.
' This does not mean that the
Democrats openly discriminate
against minorities. After all, Ron
Brown is the chairman of the
party. No, their type of racism
is far more harmful. It is covert
and unconscious. ‘
The whole basis behind the

too much government is

Pitt soccer te

By Brian "Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

Forward Dean Astorino
scored two first-half goals, and
Eric Prex added a late tally to
power the Pitt soccer team past
St. Francis (Pa.), 3-0, at Pitt
Stadium last night.

The win raised Pitt’s record
to 7-2 overall. St. Francis fell to
4-6 on the year.

On a night more suited for
hockey in Pittsburgh, the
Panthers’ booters dominated
the Red Flash with relentless
offensive pressure that easily
could have resulted in seven or
eight goals. For head coach Joe
Luxbacher, the Wednesday

    

night win allowed histeam to ,

further ﬁne its game —- as well
as the rest of some overworked
players. “This is the ninth game
in 25 days,” Luxbacher said.

play more players than we

In addition to the run-and-

Mark Duffner said that is all

part of the attacking style he
wants for his team.

The leader of that attack is
questionable for this week’s
game. Senior quarterback John
Kaleo suffered a‘ leg contusion
in the second half of last
week’s loss to Penn.State.
Duffner said Kaleo has a bro-

cleared him to play, so his
playing time will be determined
by how much pain he can
endure. _ ~ " A

“We should have capitalized

it was a good game for us to

the more he plays well, the
more he plays — period.

“He’s going to see his time,”
Luxbacher’ said. “And if he

"keeps scoring goals, he’ll see

even more time.” _._
Pitt had a veritable plethora
of opportunities all -night, espe-

nth straight

cially in the second half with
veterans Prex, Ted,Noethling,
Scott Alexander and Walter
Lamory wreaking havoc on the
slower St. Francis squad.
Another upstart Panther provid-

' ing most of those chances was

junior midfielder Eric Duffy,

who was absent from the scor-

ingcolumn but played one of
his best offensive games at Pitt.
Luxbacher credits Duffy’s expe-

rience as the key factor. in the’

development of [the Mt.
Lebanon native.

“Eric is very composed,”
Luxbacher said. “Besides being
well skilled, he knows whento

pass [and] when "to hold [the

ball]. He’s a good player.”

For Duffy, the drastic
improvement in his play — as

[well as the play of the entire

team — is a matter of total
team play. Pitt was expected to
dwell at the bottom, not the
top, of the Big East.

“First, we’re underrated,”
Duffy said. “Teams come in
here thinking we’re Western PA
kids  [that] we don’t have
much talent. Secondly, the way
we’ve got our system attacking
with Prex and Alex [Scott

-Alexander] working up front

we’re just overall playing bet-
ter.” .

Pitt dominated from the out-
set, gaining most of the scoring

chances in the latter portion of

the first half. Three times with-’

in a two-minute span, the

Panthers sent shots careening
towards the Red Flashlnet.

through four games this year
after having a 2-9 record in
1991. This would disappoint
some players ‘but not
Jarmolowich. He said that he
realizes everybody faces the
same problems, so it is not the
actual event that causes adver-
sity but how you handle it that
determines whether you are a
success -or a failure. '
“We’Ve had some problems
as of late — some ups and
downs — including, most of
all, a head coaching change,
but I consider this a challenge
rather than a hindrance,”
Jarmolowich said. “I know it_

THE prrr NEWS, Thursday, October 1, 1992

will make me a‘ better person
in the long run.”

Ja-rmolowich said that no sec-
ond thoughts about attending
Maryland ever entered his
mind. He was recruited heavily
by several I-AA schools but
was determined to play in
Division 1. Other than Wake
Forest, Maryland was really the
only Division I school that
showed interest in
Jarmolowich. _

“Maryland was close to my
home in Union, New Jersey, so
when Maryland recruited me, I
really had no trouble in decid-
ing where to attend college and
play big-time football.”

Pitt offense faces Butkus candidate  Jarmolowich

. And it is obvious
Jarmolowich feels he made the
right decision.

“I am having a lot of fun here
at Maryland. There is always
something to do, with
[Washington] D.C. and
Baltimore each only about 20

.minutes away from campus,”

Jarmolowich said. “Plus I
attended Fork Union Military
Academy for prep school.
Anything is better than that.
When I got to Maryland, I real-
ized that the discipline I
encountered there will only
help me later in life, but I am
glad to be through with that

Get your wallet ready: The Schoolboys turn pro

By Rob Pugliese
and Brian Berger
The Pitt News

Due to a rampant computer virus, The
Schoolboys have been forced to wander
into the hectic world of professional
football — a more tumultuous betting
world.

So we’re gonna guess and not
promise, but remember, like Charlie
Ward, the Schoolboys are winners! Oh,
by the way, remember MC’s Peanut
Butter and Jelly.

Catch FSU-Miami on Saturday. Sleep
in Sunday. The real game jumps off
Monday at 9:00.

Dallas (4-0) at Philadelphia (5-0) -4:

It’s time for all bandwagon Cowpoke
fans to wake up and realize that the
Eagles’ D is much too much. Randall is
gonna shake-and—bake all over the Vet
and Freddie Bamett will fly in a prime-
time showdown with Michael Irvin.
There ain’t gonna be anything pretty
about this. Let’s run a few names by ya
— Reggie, Seth, Clyde, Andre, Wes and
Eric. Get the picture. F—- the Cowboys.
It’s all downhill for Big D from here.
(By the way, Pugs sends a personal
shoutout to Keith “no class” Jackson.
Save up cause now you’re gonna have
to buy a Super Bowl ticket and enjoy
pansyland in the AFC East.) Take the
Birds -4

Miami (3-0) +11 at Buffalo (4-0):

The Bills have beaten up on Patsies
all season but are impressive 4-0 vs. the
number. Last week they covered a big
number at New England. Dolphs are
enigmatic struggling to win against
weak Seattle squad. Marino appears to
be in top form, and addition of Keith
Jackson should only add excitement to
the team. Bobby Humphrey was appar-
ently swept away with Hurricane
Andrew and Mark Higgs has filled in as
scat back. Bills should be able to score
at will but so should Dolphs against
overrated Bills defense. Strange, "but this
is the second most important game in
Florida this weekend. Bills giving too
many here Take Dolphs +11.

Lions formidable at the Silver Dome
but fail to cover and lose last week on

resurgent Bucs — ya gotta love Santana
Dotson and the Bucs. An exciting band-
wagon choice, so forget the Braves and
the Cowboys. Saints had every opportu-
nity to knock off the ‘Niners last week
in their own dome, but Bobby Hebert
single-hancledly turns Saints’ fans to
fainting. He’s brutal. Saints’ defense is
still bloodthirsty while Lion blockers are
struggling miserably to open daylight

Mason

Continued from page 9
He was a major reason why
the Terrapins racked up 30
first downs against one of the
country’s stingiest defenses.

That, coupled with 518
total yards, gives a true indi-
cation of exactly what faces
the Pitt defense. Earlier this
season Mason put together
two monster efforts — 164
yards against North Carolina
State followed by 164 more
against West Virginia.

But Pitt already knows
about Mason’s skills. Last sea-
shredded the
Panthers for 118 yards on just
17 carries, including a 19-
yard touchdown.

“From playing against him
last year and from seeing him
on film, he’s fast and he’s
mobile. To me — I think he’s
one of the best backs we’re
gonna face all year,” Pitt line-
backer Charles Williams said.
“He’s elusive, he’ll make you
miss. And when he turns the
corner. on you, he really puts
on the speed.”

Mason shot out to a blazing
start last season as well, pick-
ing up 452 yards on 82 car-
ries before breaking the tibia
in his right leg during the
fifth game against Georgia
Tech. He missed the remain-
der of the campaign.

mance indicates Mason is
back to full strength.
According to Maryland head
coach Mark Duffner, Mason
practiced at full speed from
spring drills on and has com-
pletely recovered his 4.3
speed.

“He is healthy. He’s
regained his speed,” Duffner
said. “I’m real happy to have
him in _a Maryland uniform.

“He does a nice job when

l he doesn’t have the football

in terms of blocking and exe-

cuting fakes. He just practices
with tremendous intensity
each and every day. He really
sets the tone for practice.”
But the Panther defense
will not express similar senti-

9 ments. Pitt’s task becomes
Thus far, his 1992 perfor-~

even more formidable when
facing Maryland’s “run—’n’-
shoot” offensive system, a
wide-open attack predicated
on throwing the football 75
percent of the time.

, _The.difference- here is most

run-’n’-shoot clubs do not
have a backfield weapon
like Mason. I

The combination of the
Terrapins’ run-’n’-shoot ‘pass-

lems for most teams and puts

‘ Pitt in a precarious position.

Superback-Mark Mason didn't look so super against former
Pitt defensive lineman Sean Gilbert on this play last year.

“Mason’s the key,” Hackett
said. “If they didn’t have a

back  then you could just‘

load up and play the pass 
almost 75 percent of the time
they pass. But the effective
part of the offense is the fact

they’ve got a very good run-

ning game. We saw him last
year, and we struggled with
him last year, and he wasn’t
even in the run-’n’-shoot,
which spreads everybody
out. C

“It’s a tall order. It’s a
tough assignment,” Hackett
said. “They run the ball very,
very well. We’ve got to stop

the running game.”

Williams expects Pitt to
employ a defensive scheme
very similar to last week’s
Minnesota game plan.

and [that I] am now at

Maryland instead [of
someother schooll.” ‘-
Jarmolowich has

expressed a positive atti-
tude concerning Mark

‘ Duffner, the new coach

at Maryland.

“Our new coach is very
enthusiastic,” ]armolo-
wich said. “This is proba-
bly what I like best about
the Maryland football
program. All the coaches
have very positive atti-

tudes and it trickles

down into the players.
The pace is very fast and
upbeat. I am actually
having more fun now
than ever.”

And Mike Jarmol-
owich’s play on the field
certainly characterizes
these attributes.

“I think hustle is the
key. You can’t afford to
give up on even one
play. That may be the
play that decides the
game one way or the
other,” Jarmolowich said.

Also, when it comes to
a football game
Jarmolowich
doing his homework and
then some.

“I do a lot of studying,
a great deal of film work
and I make sure’I am

‘mentally prepared to

play.”
Despite the emphasis

1 on. watching others play,

he does not try to model
himself after any other
players.

"I never base myself on
somebody else. I don’t
try to be the “next Jack

offense is that they’ve got a
very good running game.”

Mason has been explosive so
far this season, gaining 516
yards in four games. Pitt has
had trouble stopping the run,
and they could be even worse
with the run-and-shoot spread-
ing out the defense.

While the Maryland offense
has been racking up the yards
in bunches, the defense has
been giving them up in droves.
Worse yet, opposing teams
have not had the kind of prob-

lems finishing drives that the

Terps have had. Maryland’s
four opponents have averaged
31 points per contest.

Duffner pointed to the return
to health of defensive tackle
Darren Drozdov. The 280-
pound senior’s playing time
was.limited by a flu bug as
Penn State ran over the Terp’s
defense last week.

The star of the,Marylandl

defense is middle linebacker
Mike Jarmolowich, an All-ACC

selection last year. The Butkus‘

Award (best linebacker) nomi-

nee leads the team with*37

tackles and two interceptions.
Hackett compared the

Maryland defense to the Kent ,

defense that Pitt faced in its
opening game.
Maryland put eight men on

the line of scrimmage and chal-
lenged the Pitt passing game -

with that defense and was
burned for 51 points. V

This kind of defense -is meant
to take away the run, but the
Maryland defense is giving up
an average of 206.3 yards rush-
ing per contest.

This game looks like a
shootout. Both offenses can roll
up big numbers, and both
defenses have struggled.
Maryland has the run-and-
shoot, but Pitt has more
weaponry."

Billy drops the Crystal 15511
in Mr. Saturday Night.
PAGE S-3

 

Racial exploitation: the white man Vs. the
black man results in the black man VS. the
black man. Playwright August _Wilson
explores the black experience and the
blues in Ma Rom/zey’s Blac/2 Bottom at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater.

It is 1927 and “Mother of the Blues,” Ma
Rainey, and her band are to record their
songs for a Chicago studio. Band mem-
bers Cutler, Toledo, Slow Drag and Levee
arrive first, retiring to the basement to
rehearse and argue over their music.
Upstairs, Ma’s agent Irvineand producer
Sturdyvant Worry over their client’s tardi-
ness and general disrespectful behavior.

Continued from page S-1

In a burst of noise and chaos,
Ma arrives with a disgruntled
policeman charging her with
assault and battery. Ma has dis-
turbed the peace after a cab dri-
ver refused to transport her

_ group. But Irvin quickly appeas-

es the policeman monetarily
and lets the recording session
begin.

“All they want is my voice on
their recording machine,” Ma
admits, comparing herself to a
whore whose worth lies solely
in gratifying others. “They can
roll over and put their pants
back on” once they’ve captured

. _.Ma’s voice and their big proﬁt.

,But Sandra Reaves-Phillips, as

"Ma Ralney, exerts an energy of

pride that no white or black
man can control. Sincerity in the
actor’s singing of the blues

explains Ma’s arrogant handling

of others. She knows how her
people suﬂ’ered and won’t allow

the same for herself, despite the

necessity to sell her music to the
white man.
Band member Toledo (John

"Henry Redwood) discourages

this “selling—out” in young Levee
(Monté Russell), whose song-
writing talent adapts more readi-
ly to the white producers’ ideas
than to his black heritage.

Redwood spurts out his charac-
ter’s overﬂow of philosophy
without a breath or batting of
an eye and with great earnest-

ness and charm.

Faith in God surfaces as the
last stronghold to which these
musicians cling. Hearing Levee’s
“God hates niggers,” Thomas
Martell Bn'mrn’s Cutler falls out
of his srnugness into an uneasy

. defense of his beliefs, frightened

when his only hope is called
into question.

Director‘ Claude Purdy avoids
creating stereotypes of Irvin
(Larry John Meyers) and
Sturdyyant (William Thunhurst)

— the play’s two representatives
of the 19205 whitevrecording
industry. They please Ma finan-
cially, musically and any way
they can — but history and the
other characters tell us they
exploited blacks for profit.
Purdy allows the facts to speak
for themselves, placing the
stronger emphasis on the black
vs. black issue.

Vicki Smith’s set divides the
stage into four levels: the
offices, recording studio, band
room and basement. With detail
down to the red light for record-
ing, Smith creates plenty of
areas for Purdy to play, while
Phil Monat’s lighting helps
guide the eye from the musi-
cians rehearsing in the base-
ment to the producer wandering
through his upstairs office.

Teasing, storytelling and
humor create a warmth in the
characters’ interactions which
the actors find quite naturally.
They become each others con-
ﬁdants, teachers and sometimes
enemies.

“Ma’s going to show you
her black bottom” now
through Nov. 1 at the Pittsburgh
Public Theater on the North
Side. For tickets and information

call 321-9800.

Nothing special in
)By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

Billy Crystal has made few
mistakes in his gradual ascent
among the upper echelon of
comic actors in the world
today. Sure, he did play the
starring role in a film about the
first pregnant man on earth
(Rabbit Test). And he did lose
the judge role in “Night Court”
to Harry Anderson in the early
‘L}’)s. But besides those two
s1ip—ups (the latter of the two
may have been a godsend),
Crystal has been a pretty keen
decision—maker when it comes
to choosing roles — deftly
avoiding the Chevy Chase syn-
drome.

Until now.

The star of such box office
and critical winners as When
Harry Met Sally and Running
Scared, Crystal slides closer to
earth — and into sentimental
glop — in his latest sap-
induced film Mr. Saturday
Night —— the story of Buddy

'Young, Jr., a middle-of-the-

road stand—up comedian.

. Directed by and starring Crystal

as Buddy, Saturday Night is a
flashback combination of
laughter and tragedy — juxta-
posing key moments of fit and
fancy in Buddy’s rollercoaster
past with his murky, sad
future.

The idea for Saturday Night
came from a character that first
Crystal—ized 10 years ago in his

monster success in 1991 with
City Slicleers, the top. grossing
comedy of the year, super-film
star Crystal expanded the life

thereby expanding the quips

-Bob Roberts: strammin’

' Dov_e, stumps his way across the Commonwealth of

   

a politically right time

By Rob Penman
Staff Writer

The Freewheelin’ Bob Roberts. Yes, it’s true — at least in
the fiction of Tim Robbins. A 35-year-old Wall Street broker/
folk singer, backed by the “anti—drug” organization Broken

Pennsylvania in a bid for the U.S. Senate. Here we are folks,
the newest and most scary spin on far-right politics — a
charismatic, conscientious raiser using all the tricks ofa Bob
Dylan or Woodie Guthrie, turning them inward upon the
social programs of Roosevelt considered to be established
public policy.

Shot at various locations in Western Pennsylvania, Tim
Robbins — writer, director and star of Bob Roberts — shot
his film as aldocumentary. Quick scene and personal
changes, television footage and personal testimonials and
extemporanious racist, sexist and homophobic outbursts is
the framework of this fished product of a fictional British
reporter’s inquiry of the Bob Roberts phenomenon.

The setting is in the not—so-distant past — October 1990.
America is gearing up in Saudi Arabia in Operation Desert
Shield, and our economy is in the beginning of a brutal and
drawn-out recession. Roberts plays upon the frustrations of
rusted—out Pennsylvania. He sings to packed theatres about
the spend—thrift polices of liberals with his ditty “I’m A

Kuntu Theaters Penny from bear/en

By Karen E. Burns
For The Pitt News

For a university that takes
pride in a faculty with impres-
sive credentials, Associate
Professor Rob Penny of Pitt’s
Black Studies department offers
Pitt another reason to take pride
in its members. Penny’s contri-
butions to the arts have been
nationally recognized, recently
being honored by Chicago’s
ETA Creative Arts Foundation.

But what is the appeal that
Penny’s work holds for the local

community? Ample opportunity
to find out is presented by Pitt’s
Kuntu Repertory Theatre which
has dedicated its entire season
to Penny. The first in a series of
three plays is “Good Black
Don’t Crack,” which runs at the
Stephen Foster Memorial
Theatre from Oct. 1-10 on
Thursdays through Saturdays at
8 p.m. and Sundays at 5 p.m.

“Good Black Don’t Crack” is a
story of the trials, tribulations
and rewards in the life of a mid-
dle—aged single mother.

next. It’s all so beautiful that the
series titles are paltry compared
to its output. It is quite amazing
how dedicated the NME and
people like Manny Theiner are
to generating these broad sound-
encompassing projects to the

city. We sing their praise.

Over The Edge is into its
fourth campaign now and is a
perfect barometer of local com-
mitment to the arts. Previous
fests have not played to packed
houses, unlike Music Lives!
which ﬂooded both the Fulton
and Rosebud with eager ears. It
is a matter of principle and not
entirely Capital that is behind the

Mellon’s Skibo Hall.
The duet wanderings of
Kumongo-ist Jen-Hi
Kim and Joseph Ce11i’s
reed and electronic
manipulations will be
on center stage as Over
The Edge tries to find
out what world it actu-
ally materialize from.
The Korean born Jin-
Hi Kim whose family
name equates to “gold”
while her first means
“dragon Princess” is a
proven composer and
improviser. Often gentle
and intricate in her
playing, Kim comes
across as dramatically . .
pleasant in her tone. . v
She has since relocated Joseph Celli andjin Hi Kim
to San Francisco with her
Komungo, “a large, fat-sounding

bamboo sticks.
Spiritua1ly—
based, Kim’s pluckings
run the gamut of new-
age healing and
Korean philosophy.
The five elements —
fire, water, air, metal
and wood — and ﬁve
directions, the fifth
being center, are
woven into Kim’s tun-
ing of the Komungo.
The whole spiel is
devoutly atmospheric
and filled with long,
quiet tones. But Kim
doesn’t slack on ener-
gy, playing with
intense concentration
which she attributes to
Court music — tradi-
akin to the Japanese koto. It is tionally a Chinese ideal with
lap-held and made of buffed Buddhism and Confucian medi-

Four separate evenings of
diversity over the next two
months shall wield a healthy
dose of the other world, begin-
ning this Saturday at Carnegie

zither” which is six stringed and wood. It draws its sound from tative qualities.

She has worked with Elliot
Sharp (what improv artist hasn’t),
Guitarist Henry Kaiser and most
recently her recording with Celli
entitled No World on O. 0. discs.
The output is complete improvi-
sational freedom. Not chaotic or
rule-breaking but heavenly tex-
tures of subtly crafted ideas.

David First’s Joy Buzzers, on
the other hand, are more attack-
ing in their approach but equally
as committed to musical elbow
room. First is one of those srhart
musicians who has received
numerous grants and awards
while playing a plethora of syn-
thetic instruments in countless
compositions. He has played at
an array of experimental music
festivals throughout his career,
but recently his Joy Buzzers have
found a home at New York’s
vigorous Knitting Factory.

“The Joy Buzzers are Sort of
my crack commando,” the enig-
matic First admits. “Our pieces
are originated as stylistic‘tem-
plates in which European ele-
ments of rock and roll, free jazz,
funk, African, Indian and classi-
cal spill out onto our individual
players.” A straight answer was
to be expected but wasn’t
received, reflecting their playing.
Sometimes I don’t know what
it’s all about, but what ever it is,
I’m with it.

Over The Edge 4 presents tbeﬁrst
of its series this Saturday evening
Oct. 3 at 8 pm. on the campus of
Carnegie Mellon in Sleibo Hall.

Penny

Continued from page S-4
the play, “Looking at Dan
Quayle’s message about single
mothers and family values, it
seems like [Penny] had [in 1972
when he started work on the
play] a vision about issues so
current today.”

The mother in the play is a ‘

“waitress with a high school
education” who “responds in a
way a professional psychologist
would be proud” to the deci-
sions she makes and the prob-
lems she faces, Lillie said.

Penny_ has been at the
University of Pittsburgh since
about 1968 and has been a
major inﬂuence in the Pittsburgh
theatre community. He has
played an integral part in build-
ing the black artistic circle.

Although Penny has gained
much recognition for his dra-
matic work, he writes poetry
that contains “sympathies and
beautiful‘ working-class images
 Many people love Rob Penny
because he writes from an Afro-
centric perspective  he~writes
with a purpose of healing,” Lillie
explains.

Lillie says that Penny is a rare»

artist in that he compromises for
no one — not for the media,
public or critics. Perhaps that is
part of the reason for his
appeal.

Lillie says, “I don’t know what
else to say about Rob  I love
him. I’ve been working with
him since 1972, and it has been
a pleasure.”

Night

Continued from page S-3

In those early scenes —
which include the Young’s
doing stand-up for the family,
the meeting of Elaine and
Buddy and make-or-break
moments in Buddy’s career
-— several plotlines take for-
mation: a selfish Buddy Vs
everyone who wants to help
him, Buddy vs Stan, Buddy
vs everyone who works for
him and Buddy vs Buddy.

Not only are there too
many story twists, but there is
too much emphasis on plot-
lines that border on being
goofy. The whole brother vs.
brother thing with Buddy and
Stan is as worn as the lines
about sleeping with your
wife (I have too  but you?)
— only 10 times more pre-
dictable.

What saves the jumbled
story from wallowing in the

mire of mass confusion is the '
occasional moment of come- V

dy provided by. Crystal
onstage as..a young and old
Buddy. Inseveral sad but
amusing scenes -— where he

basically digs his show-busi-_

ness grave — Buddy can’t

resist. crude, insulting jokes
directed at important people
in the audience. At an old
folks’ home with women,

Buddy says to a lady in the.

front row: “Hey, Moses
called. He said you were a
good @‘&%!” I
Despite some crude but
touching moments between
Crystal, Paymer and Warner,
and an encyclopedia of tried-

and-true one-liners that still
live nightly in the Catskills,
the final product is little more
than a pasted together bit
with absolutely no flow.
When you expect a scene to
change, it drags on. When a
scene has just heated up, it
jumped to the present.
Simply put, there’s just too
much of no good here.
Repetition at its worst.

Illniilly Crystal and Hele t wrestle on the street  SataraayINigbt

Crystal should be forgiven
for this less-than-stellar effort.
It is far better than the worst
films of other comic stars like
Robin’ Williams, Bill Murray
and Eddie Murphy —— who
made filmic boners with
shameless subject matters. At
least Crystal’s has sincerity
and heart. Too bad it is satu-
rated and lethargic sentiment.
