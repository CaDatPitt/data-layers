Got Parking   ,
You’re Not Alone, Bud  

By Tony Glasser

.To park and where to park is the question.

At least that’s the question bothering quite a few students these
days. .With so many unsuspecting parents still being brow-beaten
out of the family car, parking space is as scarce as Guﬁey voters.

 . .Consider that part of Schenley park opposite Foster memorial.
Along about 8:30 a. m. it resembles the Indianapolis speedway on
Memorial day. .From all directions of the compass, bleary-eyed but

Alma Mater. Hunger for knowl-
edge or Tuck shop coffee’ spurs
them on in the mad scramble.
Meek, bespectacled English ma-
jors become raging wild-eyed
demons. The cute little blonde
who is so friendly in the hall tears
off your right front fender as she
desperately beats you to a space.
A gloating leer replaces her soft
smile as your search continues.
All this time the park police are
conveniently ﬁnding business else-
where.

Schenley gendarmes estimate
that 750 cars now park in the
space allotted 450. All this causes
many enterprising people to act.
Yesterday two cars were seen
resting inthe bowl of the foun-
tain to the‘rear of Schenley cir-
cle. One senior decided to drive
around and wait for. some gne to
move. He ran out of gas on the
796th lap. Persons “in the know”
now bring a lunch and many small
groups can be observed picnicing
along the wayside while the strug-
gle for space goes on.

Parker Heare, noted traﬁic ex-
pert says that “ . . . there is room
for all. Illegal parking will not
be tolerated.” Now every day is
tag day in Oakland. Already more
tickets have been given to stu-
dents than Were sold for the
Army-Notre "Dame game. '

Finest meaning that more people

Never the ones to dally, our
gallant veterans’ organization is
Wrestling with the problem. A

request has gone through chan-
nels to use the entire campus as a‘
parking lot. A nominal fee of 25
cents a day would be charged.
This will be a non-profit enter-
prise with the proceeds going in-
to a movement to send Bill Dud-
ley to Pitt next year.

Despite all thatis being done
the problem continues to grow.
As automobile production in-

When the team scores were totaled, the University of Pitts-
burgh squad ranked twentieth. The Panther squad was Just

a few points behind Villanova b'ut¢

ahead of Brooklyn College, Kings
p-oint, Princeton, and Seton Hall.

The New York Unversity har-
tiers carried off the team honors
for the ﬁrst time. The Violets have
individual stars
throughout the years, but this was
the ﬁrst time that they were able
to win team honors.

Curtis Stone, Penn State star,
came from behind to win the in-
3dividual honors. His teammates
were unable to provide enough
support and the Penn State squad
had to be content with third place.

The Panther B squad has been

‘active this week also. Coach ‘Ol-

son's hopefuls scored an over-
‘whelming victory over Carnegie
Tech’s B squad, 18-37.

Penn State’s Lions loom as a
more formidable opponent than

this Saturday afternoon.

The Nittany eleven reached
their top form of the season last
weekend as they tripped the hap-

Over Penn State Lions

The roar of the Nittany Lion, which is usually reduced to
an off-key falsetto after a game with Pitt, will be heard at

  

‘ '1

X

For a change, the Panthers will have a jinx working for

A

them. Over the years the Lions
have won 17, lost 26, and tied
two in their series with Pitt. Last
year Pitt won, 6-0, when Jimmy
Joe Robinson ran back a punt
84—yards for e winning tally.

The Lions have not won sincevi

1943.

Taken on their season's ‘per-
formance this shapes up as a bat-
tle _of the lines. In their game
Pitt limited Ohio State to 117-
yards rushing—a season’; low for
the Buckeyes.
State completed 10 out of 16
passes for 226-yards.

Penn State’s best defensive per-

formance .his season was against
Temple. The Lions trounced Tem-

ple, 26-0, and allowed them six '

yards net gain from rushing. Pitt
and Temple played a careless tie
at the stadium October 12.

Penn State’s line is led by
Guards Leo Nobile and Bob Rut-
kowski. Broncho Kosanovich is the
snapper-back. Red Moore, 220-
pounder from Rochester, N.Y., and
210—pound John Nolan hold forth
at the tackles. Bucky Vfalters and

_John Potsklan handle the ter-

minals.

Effective substitutes are avail-

able in Ends Sam Taburo and Ed
Czekaj; Tackles Howard Caskey
and Bill Kyle; Guards Steve Suhey
and Joe Sarabok; and Center John
Wolosky. .
