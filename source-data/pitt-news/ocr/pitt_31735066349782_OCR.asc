BY CRIS HALL

The Commuter Association (CA)
has “voluntarily dissolved," ac-
cording to Diane Giebler. who was
elected CA president in a contro-
versial election last month.

In a letter to the Pitt News
Giebler said she was “speaking on

cﬁehalf of the Commuter Associa-

tron" when announcing the organi-
zation's disbandment.

“I've discussed this with the
other ofﬁcers." Giebler said last
night, “and we could see no reason
to continue."

Giebler said the CA's recent
dispute with the Committee on
Student Organizations (CSO) was a
major factor in the decision to quit.

“We feel a bit persecuted," she
said. “They wouldn't release our
budget and said we didn't have
enough members."

“I thought we were doing a

0 ‘pretty good job with the amount of

people we had," Giebler said.

One of the reasons behind the
decision listed in Giebler's letter
was the “immense lack of interest
by commuters as a whole.

“They just don't seem to care,"
the letter stated. “I can only hope
that Student Government will now
rise to meet commuters’ needs and
to serve their interests."

Student Government (SG) presi-
dent Barry Weisband said last

_ night he was “not surprised“ by

. Giebler's decision, and that the SG
Board would take up the commuter

meeting.
"It's out of CSO's hands now."
Weisband said. -

Linebacker
Charged In
Amp Theft

Arnie Weatherington, an all-
1 East candidate linebacker on Pitt’s
football team, voluntarily turned
himself in to city police Friday after
a warrant for his arrest was issued
on theft and receiving stolen
property charges.

Weatherington, 22, who lives in
Tower C. has been charged with
theft of a $699 ampliﬁer by his
summer employer, the Eazor
Express Co., after he was allegedly
seen leaving Eazor's dock area last
Thursday with a box later found to
contain an ampliﬁer.

Security personnel hired by
Eazor after a recent series of thefts
confronted Weatherington after he
allegedly hid the box in some
nearby bushes. The ampliﬁer was

kﬁqrecovered by the trucking ﬁrm,
-4.; which then ﬁred Weatherington

and signed a criminal complaint
against the Miami. Fla. native.

‘Commuter Association

Dis bands-After Election

“There should be asubstantial’

amount of programming for com-
muters," Weisband said, “and it
adds another dimension to Student
Government if the Board wishes to
take on the responsibilities of the
CA."

Weisband said commuter inter-
est would have to increase before a
SGB committee on commuters
would be formed.

“There hasn't been a lot of
dedication on the part of com-
muters up to now," Weisband
said. “The CA was a good
barometer, and there just wasn't a
large group of dedicated commu-
ters."

“I've tried." Giebler said. “but
I'm pretty soured on student
groups right now.

"As far as I'm concerned. that‘s
it."

Protesters Gather in Philly

BY DEANNA LOUISE

PHlLADELPHlA—Handwaving
Northeast Philadelphia residents
out to watch the July 4th Coalition
march stirred the muggy air
Sunday. So did chanting demon-
strators, 20,000 strong, marching
one and a quarter miles to Franklin
Field for a Bicentennial protest
rally.

Three busloads of coalition
members left Oakland -Saturday
night to participate in the march
and rally. The Undergraduate
Women's Union, University Wom-
en's Center and the Collective for
Alternative Education at Pitt
endorsed the rally.

Contingents of placard-toting
protesters, divided according to
issues and cities represented, from
varied age, ethnic and minority
groups marched for “jobs, equal-
ity, freedom, independence and
peace."

Pittsburghers empty buses in Philadelphia for the July Fourth

Coalition “Anti-Bicentennial” Demonstration.

They shouted to the sidewalk
brigade ﬁltered with uniformed city
police and plainclothesmen.

Pregnancy Test Evaluated

BY CONNIE GIEL

A reportedly 100% accurage
pregnancy test—reveal_ing preg-
nancy within 10 days of conception
-—is being evaluated for Pittsburgh
use by a Pitt Medical School
professor.

Dr. Monte Levitt, of the central
clinical chemistry lab, said the test.

the radioreceptor assay (RRA), is
easy to perform and yields rapid,
reliable results.

The test measures levels of a
hormone called human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (hC.G) in the blood.

Five cubic centimeters of blood
are taken from a woman who
suspect she is pregnant. If hCG is
absent, the woman is not pregnant.

Johnson's Counsel

Claims Harassment

The lawyer for Dr. Sharon
Johnson, assistant professor of
biochemistry who claims she was
denied tenure because of her sex,
has charged that university lawyers
are harassing her with charges of
professional misconduct.

Sylvia Roberts, general counsel
for the National Organization of
Women (NOW), asked Federal
Court Judge Herbert P. Sorg to
dismiss the professional miscon-
duct charges in her handling of
Johnson's sex discrimination suit.

The defense will air its case in
federal court beginning July 27.

A spokesman for Roberts said
last week that the charges by
lawyers representing Pitt were “an
attempt to harass and intimidate."

Johnson, 42. still teaches here.
She has a PH.D. in biochemistry
from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. She is suing for full

tenure, back pay exceeding $70,000
and compensatory damages of $1.5
million. '

The misconduct charges were
ﬁled by the law ﬁrms of Tucker,
Arensberg and Ferguson and Reed
Smith, Shaw and McClay.

The ﬁrms charged that Roberts
violated professional conduct by
issuing a mailed appeal for
contribution's to Johnson'sdefense
on NOW stationery. The ﬁrms
allege the appeal constituted a
“solicitation" and say the letter
contained “extrajudicial" remarks
about the case. The letter, the
ﬁrms claim, violates bar associa-
tion rules.

The spokesman for Roberts said
the misconduct charges were
improperly motivated. The spokes-
man alleged that the charges were
ﬁled “solely for the purpose of
harassment."

Levitt said one drawback of the
RRA is that another hormone may
mask hCG levels. and necessitate
retesting several days later.

“The test reaches 100% accur-
acy if done later than four weeks
after a woman's last menstrual
period," Levitt said.

“However, its 95% reliability
before then still makes it superior
to the routine urine test.”

The pregnancy test was develop-
ed by Dr. Brij Saxena of Cornell
University Medical College.

Saxena approached Princeton
Laboratories, which agreed to test
and market the RRA.

It should be available by
September, Levitt said. He is one
of several doctors nationwide who
signed to ﬁeld test the RRA and
conﬁrm the results.

Women’s Health Service, Plan-
ned Parenthood and Magee-
Women’s Hospital have used the
test on almost 500 local women,
according to Levitt.

The test is not available
commercially at this time, he
stressed. but is being used at the
University Health --Center in a
testing program.

lts availability is restricted to
sophisticated labs because radio-
active material is used in analyzing
RRA results.

Each marketing lab will deter-
mine the test's costs, but now it

costs about the same as a urine
test, Levitt said.

Blasts Critics

BY TIM PETTIT
Associated Press Writer

PHlLADELPHIA—“What did
they think they were pulling into, a
motel?" asked George Keegan,
ﬁeld manager of the Bicentennial
Wagon Train.

Keegan ‘had been pacing the
ﬂoor, hands on hips, as reporters
peppered Bicentennial wagoneers’
about charges that members of the
wagon trains had been treated
poorly at Valley Forge National
Park.

Then he walked to the micro-
phone. “You talk about encamp-
ments—we camped in sage brush,
cactus and rocks before reaching
Valley Forge."

Sixteen wagoneers who attended
the press conference yesterday-
described their complaining fellow
travelers as persons who wouldn't
“get off their backsides."

During the weekend celebrations
at the park. wagoneers had told the
media that they were encamped
“in a mudhole," and lacked food
and water.

Jambalaya. Pleasantly lyrical.
The word seems to hold promises
of secret treasures.

The store with that name located
at 422 Semple Street does.

Low-keyed and harmonious,
with a touch of the down-home
friendliness, the vibes of this co-op
invite you to come visit, sit around
while we do our stuff and when
you're ready, join.

The ‘stuff’ that co-op members
do in the store range from
macrame, stained glass and paint-
ing to woodwork and leather crafts.
Pieces of their craft decorate the
shop; bright paintings fill up the
walls; macrame and leather belts
mix in with plants hanging from the
ceiling; and pottery and jewelry
line sectioning shelves.

This is the front room of the
four-room store. The other rooms,
made cheerful with colorful wall
paintings, stand empty yet waiting
for use as craft instruction
classrooms which are being plan-
ned by the co-op. The classes will
be free to neighborhood residents.

A macrame class is just finishing
up this week, and a one-day

On the schedule for coming
months are classes in stained glass
making, needlepoint and rug
hooking. But the biggest effort
goes to equipping the basement for
a pottery studio. An electric kiln
will be bought, a gas one made by
co-op members, and when the
throwing wheels arrive, the co-op
will be set to give classes.

Co-op members have access to
any craftmaking equipment avail-
able in the shop. A loom, three
sewing machines, wood cutting
tools are there for cooperative use.
And Jambalaya is arranging to
stock cloth at bulk rates, making it
available for members at a discount
price.

Original organizers, Christy Ges-
ley and Gregg Bowders, set up the
co-op along the lines of the 1930’s
WPA, which was established by
the federal government to ease the
poverty of post-depression unem-
ployed artists. “That,” says
Gesler, “is what we are here for.
Serious instruction for dedicated,
aspiring artists.”

be ready to set up shop for him or
herself."

The program is open to anyone
interested in learning, but co-op
members share in move of
Jambalaya's benefits. It costs five
dollars per year for membership
and each member is asked to put
five hours a month into the running

of the store. Some artists work off 1

their hours teaching classes. others
mind the store an hour or two a
week or make the supply runs.

In exchange, the co-operative
sells members work at a 15%
commission, and occasionally holds
an exhibition of an especially
dedicated artist.

The co-operative is coming to
reflect more and more the true
meaning of its exotic name.
Besides being lyrical, the word
Jambalaya means a dish that is a
pastiche of everything. Gesler says
the name was chosen to express the
co-operative’s intention to promote
the cultural richness of various
ethnic backgrounds. But it also can
be taken to stand for the
hodge-podge of artisan skills that
Jambalaya is exploring in it's little
artistic dive.

STATE AUDIT SHOWS
MED SCHOOL OVER-FUNDED

The state should move to recover
more than $100,000 erroneously
appropriated Pitt for the ﬁscal year
ended in mid-1975, according to
state Auditor General Robert P.
Casey. ‘

A recent audit prepared by
Casey shows Pitt was given $4
million in state funds for the
operation of its Doctor of Medicine
program during that period, based
on an allocation of $7,465 for each
of 532 expected full-time students.

According to the audit, there
were only 516 participants in the
program, which means the correct
award should have been approxi-
mately $3,850,000.

TEACHER STABBED IN
OAKLAND

A Schenley High School teacher
was stabbed to death last week in
his Oakland apartment.

Rose Marie Collmer found
Joseph Gates, a tenant in her
apartment house at 4634 Filmore
Street, dead last Wednesday
evening when she went to collect
the rent.

 

A suspect. John Lancaster, 25, of
Sistersville, W. Va., has been
taken into custody.

Before Collmer discovered the
victim. her purse was stolen while
she waited outside the apartment
building for Gates.

SANDBLASTING CONTINUES

Joseph Graciano Company em-
ployes will be sandblasting the
limestone walls of the Schenley
Quadrangle on Forbes Avenue for
another week from 6 p.m. to 1:30
a.m. daily. Sandblasting on the
Fifth Avenue side should take two
additional weeks,

After sandblasting is completed,
the walls will be treated with an
anti-grafﬁtti silicon, to protect
them from grafﬁtti, which can be
rubbed off the silicon with a rag.

The silicon-covering operation
will not take nearly as long as the
sandblasting to complete, accord-
ing to Joseph Stewart, a foreman
for the Graciano Company.

The sandblasting process will
take about 1/64 of an inch away
from the building surface, which
includes crayon shavings and paint
chippings.

WASHINGTON (AP)——-The by the three Supreme Court second chance in federal court if

Supreme Court refused on Tuesday
to review the constitutionality of
Philadelphia ordinances prohibit-
ing masseurs and masseuses from
massaging persons of the opposite
sex.

Over objections from Justice
William J. Brennan, the court
declined to interfere with a U.S.
Circuit Court decision upholding
the ordinances.

The circuit court in Philadelphia
rejected the constitutional chal-

lenge to the ordinances primarily '

on the basis of three previous
Supreme Court actions.

In those cases, the high court

Brennan said the court ought to
hear the Philadelphia case. In
addition, he suggested that the
justices should give some reasons
when they summarily afﬁrm or
reverse lower court rulings.

To take such action without
disclosing the reasons only causes
confusion in the lower courts, he
complained.

COURT CUTS BACK PRISONER
RIGHTS

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
Supreme Court, in a break with the
Earl Warren court, cut back the
power of state prisoners to
challenge their convictions in
federal court.

they have already had a fair chance
to persuade state courts they were
convicted with illegally obtained
evidence.

In 1961, the Supreme Court ruled
that state courts must exclude from
criminal trials any evidence obtain-
ed in violation of this constitutional
ban. This is called the exclusionary
rule and is designed to deter police
misconduct.

In yesterday’s decision, the high
court speciﬁcally retained that
ruling as far as it applies to the use
of evidence in trials and the right of
the defendant to appeal to state
courts.

The court, however, severely
weakened the impact of, a 1969
decision which allowed prisoners to
argue in federal court that the
evidence was obtained illegally.

A More and Better 

   

Commuters, it appears, no longer have the Commuter Association
(CA) to stick up for them.

Which would mean quite a bit, if not for the fact the Commuter
Association in past years did little or no sticking up.

Mainly a one-man effort by past president Larry Chaban, the CA was
plagued by a severe case of student apathy. The Student Government
Board each year is faced with too few voters to even hint at a majority,
but the CA has been unable to ﬁnd enough voters to even meet
Committee on Student Organizations’ regulations.

The reason commuters are not interested in attempting to improve
their own lot is mystifying. Understandably, many do not have enough
time due to extended bus rides home or to after-school employment.
But that is not true of all commuters, and it seems some of them could
have found the time to argue over inadequate parking and high-priced

“buses.

But the question now is moot. There is no more Commuter
Association, according to a letter from current-president Diane
Giebler. ~

While it is an unfortunate end to a confusing situation, the CS0 was
correct in demanding the same standards from the CA it does of other

A student organizations. It was clear the Commuter Association was not
performing, and student money should not be charmeled into such a

group.

The question which remains is, what will the commuters do now?
It has been suggested a new committee be formed within Student

Government to handle commuter affairs.

For- reasons stated

previously, this is not aagood suggestion.

The obvious answer is the one offered by SGB president Barry
Weisband. Student Gcvermnent should carry on the programs of the
CA, and more importantly, do more.

The Pitt student body is primarily commuter. Any student
goverrmient representing the Pitt student body should primarily

represent commuters.

Because student organizations tend to be staﬂed by resident
students and apartment-dwellers, commuters are easily overlooked.
But for the plain and simple reason that the majority of money in
Student Govermnent’s coffers comes from commuters’ activities fees,
- the Student Government should take special pains to insure commuter

needs are attended to.

Among those needs are more and better parking, more and better
afternoon and early evening programming and a continued search for
inexpensive alternatives to the half-a-dollar PAT bus fare.

Weisband seems to understand the potential the Board has for
taking on the new task and producing results. Let’s hope that potential

is realized.

PI-IILADELPHIA-—The July 4th
Coalition, a collection of social and
political misfits, gathered Sunday
in Philadelphia for an “anti-
Bicentennial" demonstration. It
was an interesting afternoon.

I went to Philadelphia prepared
for the worst; or best, depending

on one's point of view. Few people .

like violence, but such is the stuff
of which is made front pages.

I, and several other journalists,
went to Philly looking for a tight.

Mayor Frank Rizzo had asked
Governor Shapp for 15,000 Na-
tional Guardsmen to help Philadel-
phia’s 8,000-man police force keep
his city's streets calm. He didn't
get them.

He didn't need them.

that the Pitt News is in dire need of
talented writers.

Let us straighten Mr. Moore out

. on a few points, as it appears that

he certainly has not done his
homework. V
First, mentors do not tell funny
Pitt jokes at their meetings; they
are not trained to be comedians. If
he had researched the Orientation
program thoroughly instead of
basing his put-down on a single
mentor meeting three years ago
involving a mentor that graduated
two years ago, he would have found
that mentors go through extensive
training which prepares them to be
friends, peer counselors, and
information-referral persons. No-
tice they are not trained to teach
first grade. but to offer advice and
help on a friend-to-friend basis.
Secondly. mentors prefer to
think of themselves as friends to

"T"  _,the freshmen. It is Mr. Moore who

  

Letters to the

It is evident from the article_

    

chooses to picture us as Ulysses’

mythical tutors.

Thirdly, it is the Pitt News, not
the mentors, who degrades the
freshmen by expecting them to
believe that “most mentors are

_worthless” before they have had

the opportunity to experience te
program for themselves. Ask the
freshmen who have had problems
(both large and small) straightened
out by Mentors and the Orientation
staff if they thought that Orienta-
tion was a waste.

The Orientation program is
always in need of more upper-class
Pitt students who are willing‘ to
work towards the goal of helping
new students adapt to this “real
world" urban university. But the
biased and totally unfounded
article. which was published in the
Pitt News undermines all of our
work, and that is unnecessary.
We question Mr. Moore's
sources of information. Since he
did not talk to any mentors.
freshmen or the Orientation staff,
we wonder exactly who he did talk
to. We suggest that at some time
in the near future he should find
out what Orientation is really all
about. If the mentors can be called
worthless based on the contents of
the Orientation schedule. imagine
what adjectives could be applied to
the editor of the Pitt News.

Commuter

Association

Defunct

V I wish to inform you, on behalf of
the Commuter Association, that we
voluntarily dissolve.

In the past we have tried, to the
best of our ability, to serve the
commuting student body. During
the past two years this task has be-
come increasingly difficult, due to
an immense lack of interest by
commuters as a whole.

They just don’t seem to care.

Now it seems that we have finally
reached the end. Understaffed,
and uncared for, the Commuter
Association is dead. I can only
hope that Student Government will
now rise to meet commuters’ needs
and to serve their interests.

I myself do not intendlto try to
raise any furor over the events of
the past \few months; however, I
cannot speak tor the rest of our
membership.

Diana L. Giebler
President. Commuter Association

The Coalition had predicted
200,000 would march through the
streets and cram Fairmont Park to
hear some two dozen speakers
criticize the way things are in
America today.

But the crowd was nowhere near
that large, and enough city cops
were there in blue to drown out red
and white and become the
afternoon’s predominant color..

Aside from clearing the parade
route, the police had a very boring
afternoon. They stayed a short
distance from the demonstration,
minding their own business.

One cop summarized what
seemed to be the whole force’s
thoughts:

“I really don't know what to
expect,” he said. “I sure hope
there isn’t any trouble, and they'll
have to start it if there is.

“But I'll tell you one thing. If
something does start, we won’t
lose.” ‘

He was right on all counts.

Nobody knew what to expect, so
they expected the worst. The cops
had riot gear, and the marchers
were told not to wear contact lenses
because of a possible tear-gas
attack.

But the only violence was
beween different groups of demon-
strators, and the riot helmets were
used as pillows. I ,

So, after some monotonous
chants, the speakers were left to
speak.

No riot story, I thought. Maybe
one of the speakers would say
something worth putting into print.

Wrong again. The speakers
were as monotonous as the chants.
Contradiction and hollow rhetoric
from speaker after speaker.

They spoke of government lies,
while their own press agent said
the crowd was 58,000 strong. CBS

C-MU Theater Ensemble

City Players Play the Parks

BY TOBI ROSEN

Now that the bicentennial
hubbub is behind us, we can get
down to some serious celebrating.

We shall celebrate summer. The
time has come when strolling
players take to the streets with
shows of mime, mask and music.

- _But in Pittsburgh, our players take

to the parks.

In City Players in the Park
started their sixth‘ season of free
theatre with a 1920s style musical
version of Shakespeare’s Comedy
of Errors. The story is about a
gentleman and his servant, who
while searching the world for their
lost twin brothers, unwittingly
arrive at the town where their
“other halves” live. This madcap
of mistaken identities adds to the
comic confusion.

Even in this updated version,
Shakespeare’s delightful witticisms
subleties and nuances are sacriﬁc-
ed for the big visual laughs. But
when playing to hundreds of

lounging people, thismust be
expected. Barbara Knowles and
Susan Cash as the pair of twin
servant-brothers walk. (or in this
case scamper) away with most of
the laughs. Their timing is
excelletn and they master the
musical numbers.

The season holds more laughs.
They come in the children’s theatre
special offering, Androcles and the
Lion.

Amidst all the fun, Androcles
manages to slip in a moral or two.

A man and a beast learn the

importance of friendship and
understanding. Happy ending for
all, especially for the children.

The children will often snitch on
the villains or assist the hero. The
actors are learning how to work
these bits into the action.

They sprinkle each production
with spontaneous outbursts.

Rounding out the season, will be

A Dash ofDozz|e

Missed In Concert

BY TOM WASELESKI

You wouldn’t think an act like
Seals and Crofts could lose much
going from studio to stage.

Not that they were bad at their
two , shows Friday at the Syria
Mosque. But a certain drive, a sort
of sparkle, just a dash of dazzle was
undeniably missing.

Take “Diamond Girl.” Despite
Bill Como on keyboards, the
punchy rhythms that gives the song
its characteristic drive was lost.
Had it not‘ been for Dash Crofts’
gyrations at the feet of the stage
(he not only resembles McCartney,

‘ he moves like him) the song may

have been a letdown.

The evening's most well-
received number was “We May
Never Pass This Way Again," a
song held by the duo and some of
its fans with philosophical rever-
ence. Como came through on this
one, delivering just the right touch
of synthetic strings from his
mellotron. then turning his piano
onto some funk in the middle.

Another big hit, “Summer
Breeze." went pretty much the
same way. The vocals seemed a bit
forced at times, but luckily the
instruments were on the mark.

Most of the evening was taken
up with other pop songs rather than
some of their more thoughtful
album cuts. They led off with
“Hummingbird” and eventually
got around to doing‘ “Baby Blue”

and “Goodbye Old Buddies” from
the new album, Crofts sounding as
horribly tinny during his solo on the
last one as he does on the recorded
version.

The title cut from the “Get
Closer” LP was one of the
evening’s high points, featuring
Carolyn Willis on backup. With a
voice like a well-oiled sax, she’s a
thrilling vocalist in her own right
and should be out recording her
own gold albums rather than being
dwarfed by an accomplished group
like Seals and Croft.

Overall the pair did better with
their new ventures than with their
old standards. Willis was a hit, as
was a long, untitled instrumental
on which Jim Seals nearly blew out
his lungs with the help of a searing
saxophone. The whole band
shifted from soft rock to hard funk
with incredible adroitness, and the
house was on fire with pleasure at
the fresh direction.

Perhaps even fresher was the
pair’s closing hoe-down, on which
Seals fiddled his way into the
hearts and minds of the sons and
daughters of steel workers, sud-
denly tuned into country.
Meanwhile Crofts and bassman
Ralph Humphrey performed a
degenerate parody of the Virginia
reel. then led the crowd into some
equally professional hog calls.

in a typical city neighborhood. I
have not yet seen the play, so I can
not tell you what a “typical” city is.
Nor can I tell you what a “typical"

District is different than strolling
through Squirrel Hill.

But wherever this middle-
America lies, we will look at its

children. postmen, sewer workers
as they engage in the activities of
the most typical weekday, Tues-

remainder of summer. For more

‘Steel

BY MREA CSORBA

The University Theatre is offer-
ing a revised version of the
documentary drama “Steel City.”
For "those who sat through the
three-hour, fifteen-minute spring
show, it will be welcome news to
learn that the production has been
trimmed to a tight two and a half.

Though I could not -help but
admire the enthusiasm and obvious
zeal of non-Pittsburgh authors
Gillette Elvgren and Attilio Favor-
ini, who packed the original
production with a hodge-podge of
Steel City history. Unfortunately
though much of it was tangical to
the main story line and trying to the
audience.

This run gives us a brisked-pac-
ed, never flagging historical
entertainment.

Many of the previous ‘hit’ acts
remain intact, pleasing the audi-
ience this time around, too, with
the robust revelies of the Whiskey
Rebellion as it must have happened
in a Soho bar (Southside).

The bustling industry, the sweat
of which put this town on the map
was portrayed with enough clang-
ing and banging to put the elves of
St. Nick‘ out of business, and once
again, Carnegie made his brisk
appearances impersonated not by
one, but three bustling men. (How
else can his energy be effectively
portrayed). The gay “Soho on a
Saturday Night,” captured perfect-
ly the spirited pun intended of the
high-pitched nineties.

Other scenes were brought

‘ firmly to the point. But sometimes

to a fault. Though Favorini and
consultant Rinear wielded the
cropping knife deftly in many
scenes; at times their efforts to
conqdntrate the play were some-
times frustratingly choppy for the
audience.

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Sipping a few frosty beers with good friends always gets me into a
talkative mood. Over the weekend I gathered with a few of my best,

and we started to shoot the breeze.

The night had gotten a bit hazy when one of them brought up the

name of Jim Morrison.

To refresh your memory, Morrison was the maniacal lead singer for
one of the 1960’s most innovative groups, The Doors. He is supposed
to have died while vacationing in Paris on July 3, 1971. The day of his
death, like his life, was full of excess and mystery.

The autopsy report on Morrison was released weeks after his burial.

Group members Ray Manzarek, Robby Kreiger and John Densmore
were not notiﬁed of his death until one week after the alleged funeral.

Very strange indeed.

Why would the band members be excluded from the funderal? Does
a coroner’s report of a heart attack conclusively explain Morrison’s

death ?

Unlike Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Brian Jones and the many other
rock casualties, Morrison was not a /heavy drug user. His vices were
alcohol and a great big dose of the crazies, or so it seems.

He was once arrested onstage in Miami for indecent exposure. In
fact, his stage antics throughout his career bordered on the

unpredictable.

But to really get some insight on the man, listen to the lyrics of

“Riders on the Storm,” “Crawling King Snake,”

the Lizard.’ ’

or ‘ ‘Celebration of

Morrison’s visions tend to be more than a little off the

wall. Were they true feelings, or just playing the rock-and-roll game?
It is conceivable that Morrison is alive and well today. Maybe he got
tired of being a male sex object, the raving crazy, and decided to do

something about it. Like die.

It is not that difficult to stage a death; anything’s possible given

enough money and the right people. This very moment he may be in a
chateau somewhere on the continent somewhere on the continent
living off his record royalties, or on skid-row playing the. role of a

nobody.

I don’t think we will ever know the true story behind the death of Jim
Morrison. His wife died in 1974, and took to the grave all she knew
about the circumstances surrounding her husband’s death. Morrison
himself seems the only person capable of explaining this bizarre

puzzle.

Jim, if you’re out there...p1ease write.

again, the dramatic effect was lost.

Though audience interest was
maintained to the end, the last act
unraveled the dynamic push built
up in the preceding two. Simplisti-
cally the first act could be
described as the drive to build—a
new life, or a robust town. or on the
national scale, the building of a
huge, raw country. The second act
was a progressive struggle to
incorporate the necessary ameni-
ties into the industrial age. But the
third act, in The Pensioner’s
Picnic of 1973, lost all its vigor. The
retirees seemingly exhausted by
the foregoing expenditure or

“energy, sank onto picnic benches

and mused on the struggles of old.

A Sunny Reason For Excitement!

BY TOM HALL

“For the first few days, we
didn’t have any curfew and were
pretty much on our own. But as
things got closer to game time, we
all knew what had to be done.

“We didn’t do anything different
out there; we just executed well.
When we do that, there isn’t a
team in the country we can’t
beat.”—Tony Dorsett, comment
after the Panthers’ 33-19 white-
washing of the Kansas J ayhawks in

the 1975 Sun Bowl.

December 26th, the 41st annual
Sun Bowl, and a time to remember
for Panther football fans. It was
perhaps this game more than any
other that is responsible for the
rabid excitement sweeping the
‘Oakland community over the 1976

I Pitt football season.

This game. this victory, was
special to Panther fans in many
ways. It was the ﬁrst time a Pitt
football team had won anything

aside from a regular season game
since 1937, a 21-0 victory over
Washington in, and get this, the
Rose Bowl.

Add to that the fact that the
Panthers were humiliated only
once during the regular 1975
season. a 46-10 drubbing at. the
hands of eventual national cham-
pion Oklahoma. In the Sun Bowl,
the Catswere being given a chance
to somehow. make up for that
embarrassment in a match-up
against Kansas——the only team to
beat the Sooners in the past two
years.

Kansas. like Oklahoma, ran their
offense under the guidelines set.

an offense that is virtually
unstopable if executed properly.
They were fading the Big Eight’s
top ground gainer. and a shrewd,

up 46 points against the same
Panther defense, it seemed only
logical that the Cats should be at
least a four-point underdog.

The stage was set, but this time
the script was going to come out a

 

bit different. and the Panther
defense ate up the explosive
Kansas offense as if it were a
bucket of “El Paso Fried Jay-
hawk."

Behind the leadership of quar-
terback Robert Haygood, the veer
looked like the replica of the

Opinion: Will The United States
Send Its Best To The Olympics?

5‘

BY STEVE SYBERT

Just as sure as the Olympic
ﬂame is hot, there is still another
controversy surrounding the great-
est sporting event mankind has yet
to put together. It is not an

. international  but
‘one kindled righ't"‘h"er‘é"in the good
old U.S. of A.

The United States seems destin-
ed to lose its stature of providing
the most top performers for the
Olympic Games. Four years ago in
Munich. we ﬁnished behind both
the Soviet Union and East Germany
in the medal race. And it wasn’t
because we don't include a lot of
obscure sports on our main agenda;
it was because we don't include a
lot of the top athletes from the
nation on our teams.

"It's bad enough that our pro

-mﬁbasketball players can't perform
‘r and such top American sports as

baseball and football are not
included in the Games. but now the
U.S. is closing its own cofﬁn,
merely by the way it chooses the
men and women who will represent
the country in the competition.

The recent furor arises from the
non-inclusion of Steve Williams,
possibly America's top sprinter, on
the Olympic team. §

Williams pulled a hamstring
muscle while running in a
quarterﬁnal heat of the 100 meters
at the Olympic track and ﬁeld trials
in Eugene. Oregon, June 20, and
was forced to sit out the remainder
of that event and the 200-meter
race two days later.

Williams, who was favored for
the gold medal in Montreal, has
run the 100 meters ﬁve times in the
world record-equalling time of 9.9
seconds. but now America's
biggest hope-will be missing from
the starting blocks.

This is not to say the U.S. will not
be well represented. The winner of
the trials. Harvey Glance,’ who
sprinted the distance in 10.11. his
fastest ever under automatic
timing, is a 19-year-old freshman at
Auburn. He was followed by
schoolboy sensation Houston Mc-

W-»Tear (rhymes with cheer). McTear,
4, . who clocked a 10.16. his best ever

in the event. set the world record of
9.0 in the l00—yard dash while

competing in a high school meet in
Florida. He also pulled his
hamstring at the end of the race
and has a month to prepare for the
Games. which are scheduled to get
under way July 16.

With Glance and McTear in the
blocks for the 100’ meters, -the U.S.
may not be in danger of losing the
distinction of ﬁelding the world’s
top sprinters, but then again, are
we‘ sending “the country's top
sprinters? The answer, obviously,
is no if Williams is not present in
Montreal.

A week after Williams was
knocked out of the games .via the
injury, his coach, Brooks Johnson,
appealed to the U.S. Track and
Field Committee in hopes of
getting Williams a spot on the 400-
or 1,600-meter relay squads. The
committee, as expected, heavily
opposed the idea. for it seems the
relay teams can only be composed
of those runners who have already
qualiﬁed to run in another event.

Is it right to base the selection of
the Olympic team on the outcome
of one meet, or should it reflect on
the past accomplishments of each
competitor? Does Williams’
reputation as being America's top
sprint man mean anything?

Dr. LeRoy Walker, head coach of
the men’s track squad believes
there is a better way to pick the
team. He. doesn't advocate doing
away with the Olympic trials, but
does look’ for ﬂexibility in the
present set-up. He said he believes
the selection of the team should
begin two years before the Games

are held so the eight or nine top
performers in each event can be
watched closely and their accom-
plishments tallied. Any question
not answered after the two-year
period could then be ironed out
with a qualifying meet for the
remaining/positions.

Williams was not the only
casualty in our selection process.
Terry Albritton, who set the
amateur world record in the shot
put last February with a toss of
71-8, finished" fourth at the trials
and, therefore, out of the running.
And Dan Ripley, the indoor
recordholder in the pole vault, also
had a bad day and will miss the trip
to Montreal.

Many people, who have thought
countries should not compete as
teams, but should send individuals,
so as to take out the political
overtones in the Games. must be
taking great satisfaction in this
recent circumstance. But, then,
maybe they are right. The
so-called “Communist block" in
the judged events could die out if
the political backgrounds of an
individual no longer mattered.

If a guy like Williams can get to
Montreal. why shouldn't he be able
to compete. Or should an
exception be made to get a fellow
like him on the team? After the
Soviet Union and East Germany
walk away with all the gold,
perhaps the U.S. will ﬁnally wake
up and start sending its top
athletes. Or maybe they should
drop the Olympics all together.

It may have come down to
either-or. i

Walker accounted for over 350
yards rushing against a Kansas
defense that had held Oklahoma to
just seven points. '

This is the cause of all the
excitement.

In 1976, the Panthers, under
fourth year head coach Johnny
Majors, will return 18 of the 22
starters from that 1975' Sun Bowl
team. as well as a host of
superlative second-liners.

Tony Dorsett will be back. He
needs but 94 yards a contest to be
come the all-time NCAA rushing
leader. He needs only a repeat
performance from any of his ﬁrst
three years to become the ﬁrst
player in NCAA history to
accumulate 1,000 yards in four
consecutive seasons.

Elliott Walker. Dorsett’s back-
ﬁeld mate, may take some of the
credit for Tony's success.
Opponents can no longer key on
Dorsett as they have in the past.

. Walker gained 901 yards last year, '

with a 5.6 yards-per-carry average.

The defense, though touched by
graduation. will come back strong.
Led by senior noseman Al Romano.
the squad will try to improve last
year's excellent 11.3 points per
game defense.

December 26, 1975. The date
will go down in the Panther record
books. But the 33-19 win was more
than another game. It was a
moment of celebration, new hope
for the future; and if you can take
Tony Dorsett’s word for it——-the
shape of things to come in 1976.

Triangles’ Second Half
A Test For Champions

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Pittsburgh is nicknamed the
city of champions for good reason.
Pittsburgh can claim the 1971
World Series champion Pirates.
who've dominated the National
League’s Eastern division since
1970. Think of two consecutive
Super Bowl titles and the Pitts-
burgh Steelers come to mind. For
_ tanley Cup competition, the
' ittsburgh Penguins are there.

Now add the Pittsburgh Trian-
gles tennis team, the city’s newest
champs. They’ve been in existence
since 1974, when World Team
Tennis (WTT) was formed. The
team is the reigning WTT
champion, and also ﬁnished ﬁrst in
the Eastern Division last year.

After losing the first match in the
playoff finals, 26-25, to the San
Francisco Golden Gaters, who
ﬁnished ﬁrst in the West, the
Triangles rallied at home for a pair
of victories, 28-25 and 21-14, to win
the championship.

This season, the team again was
predicted to ﬁght for ﬁrst place.
But something’s happened. The
team has dropped into last place,
with a 7-13 record at mid-season
break.

The nucleus of last year’s squad
is back, with Evonne Goolagong,
Peggy Michel, Mark Cox and Vitas
Gerulaitis, and providing able
backup are newcomers Bernie
Mitton, JoAnne Russell and Sue
Stap. So what has happened?

The change is that every other
team in WTT has become stronger
and more competitive by adding
more big-name tennis stars, while
the Triangles have stayed at the
same level and perhaps have even
regressed a little.

When it became evident the
team wasn’t winning, team owner
Frank Fuhrer made some funda-
mental changes. He placed Michel
on the disabled list, stating her
chronic shoulder was causing her
below-average performance.

This allowed Stap and Russell to K

take over women’s doubles, for-
merly dominated by Goolagong and
Michel. Goolagong was switched
to mixed doubles.

In singles, Goolagong is 13-1,
second in percentage to Chris Evert
of the Phoenix Racquets.
Goolagong’s only loss was to San
Diego's Terry Holladay. She
remains-the only player who hasn’t
slumped during the season’s ﬁrst
half.

After Fuhrer’s team changes
during the ﬁnal week of play before
the Wimbledon break, there were
signs Tri fortunes might have
changed.

First came a whooping 29-18
overtime victory over the Boston
Lobsters June 12 at the Arena.
Then, a June 9 win over the
Cleveland Nets that was the team’s
ﬁrst road win. A resurging
Gerulaitis and an improving
Russell were also good signs.

Just straws in the wind? .

Or are these signs the Pittsburgh
Triangles are at long last coming
out of a deadly slump that has
crushed hopes for a ﬁrst-place
ﬁnish in the WTT Eastern division?

The question will have to wait
now that the team has paused for
the three-week Wimbledon break.
But it will be answered when the
Triangles resume playing July 6.

CONVENTION TO BE RINGED
WITH POLICE

\ NEW YORK (AP)———Madison
Square Garden will be ringed with
police and filled with security
officers when the Democratic
National Convention opens on
Monday. But officials say they
can't isolate a convention site that

straddles one railroad and two‘

subway stations.

Nor do they want to, although
delegates can seek isolation and
the safety of numbers in free buses
that will meet them at airports and
shuttle them between the Garden
and their hotels.

Vacationing Miami Police Chief
Rocky Pomerance, the Democrats’
security consultant, said sealing off
te Garden altogether would dam-
age \“the quality of life in
America.”

And the New York City police,
noting the constitutional right to
hold demonstrations, agree. They

have been meeting with groups of . _
almost every coloration—the Yip~ .

pies, Right to Life and the National
Coalition of Gay Activists, among
others——to negotiate limits for their
planned demonstrations.

“We've had some lively discus-
sions," said Asst. Chief Daniel
Courtenay, the- police official in
charge.

The police say they don't expect
it, but they’re prepared for the
worst, with about 1,200 officers
directly assigned to the convention
‘until it ends the following
Thursday. The rest of the



27,000-member force will also be -*1‘

COURT UPHOLDS RED DYE BAN

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
U.S. Court of Appeals yesterday
upheld the federal ban on Red. No.
2 dye. which until last year was the
nation's most widely used artiﬁcial
coloring for foods, drugs and
cosmetics.

The three-judge panel upheld a
U.S. District Court decision of Feb.
6 that allowed the Food and Drug

; .

Administration to ban the coloring. 

Dye manufacturers argued that
industry should be allowed to
continue using Red No. 2 until
safety questions had been resol-
ved. In the absence of proof that
the dye definitely is harmful to
humans. they said. Red No. 2 could
not legally be taken off the market
until shown to be unsafe.

A VALUABLE LESSON

PHILADELPHIA (AP)-
Queen Elizabeth II of England
yesterday called the American
Revolution “a very valuable
lesson" that taught England to
“respect the rights of others to
govern themselves in their own
ways."

Because that lesson was learned,
she said.. the -Fourth of July
“should be celebrated as much in
Britain as in America." ,

The Queen made the observation

as she presented the United States i

with a Bicentennial gift from
England. a bell cast at the same
foundry that produced the Liberty
Bell.-

The Queen noted that the new
12.000 pound bell carries the
inscription “Let Freedom Ring"
and said “It is a message in which ,

. both our people can join and which "

I hope will be heard around the
world for centuries to come."
