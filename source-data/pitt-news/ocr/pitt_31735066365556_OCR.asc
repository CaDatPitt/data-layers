Phase II perplexes
 tenants, landlords,gIlRS I

by RON. LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

The recent shift to Phase II of
President Nixon’s rent freeze has
developed into a considerable
source of confusion among stu-
dent tenants and landlords, ac-
cording to Ron Cowell, director of
‘Off-Campus Housing. A

Under Phase II, if a landlord I

had charged higher rates in. some
of his apartments prior to Aug. 14,
he may raise the rates for all
comparable apartments to that

level, if 10 per cent of “substan-'

tial transactions” occurred be-

fore that date.

Cowell stated that a major dif-
ficulty lay in the definition of the
terminology used. Under Phase I,
he explained, a “substantial trans-
action” was defined as the action
of actually moving into the apart-
ment. Under Phase II, he said, it
is "uncertain whether this term
may now be defined as the actual

' signing of a lease.

Cowell pointed out that accep-
tance of the second definition
would enable a" more substantial
percentage of landlords, to in-
crease their rents.

One landlord, Cowell said, had
previously charged some of his
tenants for utilities. Under Phase
II, he was permitted to do the
same in all comparable apart-
ments. ‘

Another landlord, Cowell men-
tioned, checked with the Pitts-

burgh IRS office and was inform-

ed he could raise his rents under

_ the conditions stated earlier.

When a number of tenants com-

plained to Cowell’s office, be

checked with IRS, and was in-

 

formed that the landlord had in--

.deed been thus informed but

should‘ now revert to the Phase I
definition until» the situation could
be clarified through the Washing-
ton office.

is predicted here Thursday that
unless meaningful changes are
implemented soon there will b
more prison riots. ‘

“Trenton will riot before Feb-

something is done very soon,;,’.,
warned Crisman, a former inmate
who spent 15 years in various in-
stitutions across the country on
charges ranging from petty lar-
ceny to assault with intent to kill.

Davis added that the major pur-
pose of prisons like Attica and
Donne Mora (upstate New York)
is to keep little towns in business.

“Attica’s only industry is the lo-
cal pen,” he said.
Davis said that training for

guards is crucial in preventing
prison violence.

“Look at Attica,” he said. “The”

prisoners were predominantly
black and Puerto Rican while the
guards were all'white and from
rural areas.”

Davis said _that more black
guards should be hired. a

“The majority of prisoners, in
this country are black while most

by JIM MAC’

When 1,000 New York State
__Troopers -stormed Attica’s D-yard
Sept. 13, William Kunstler was
one of eight final negotiators>wait—

ing outside the walls.

Speaking before about 700 peo-
ple in the grandiose auditorium of
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Friday’, Kunstler recalled the At-

. . tica experience and described,
“the relationship of that disaster

to American society.”

Hours before the five day pris-
P’ oner revolt ended, Kunster, Tom
Wicker of the New York Times,
and six ‘other men entered the
dark cat-walks leading to “no-
man’s land,”-signed waivers re-
leasing the State of legal respon-
S’ sibility for their lives, and, for the
lasttime, met with the “elected
representatives” ‘of the Attica
Liberation Faction.

The prisoners’ demands were

“They were essentially the same

demands made at California's ,

Folsom Prison” . . . adequate food,
water, and medical /treatment,
true religious freedom, and a fair
and decent wage for labor

Had Governor Rockefeller come-
to the prison, as the prisoners re-
quested, “or at least been near-
by,” Kunstler’_argued the revolt
could have been worked out——non-
violently—within three days. As it
did end, however, over 40 pris-
oners and nine hostages were kill-
ed by trooper’s bullets.

and the judicial system are delib-

of our’ society whom we hate,

Continuing, Kunstler said, “Our

stamp of the court gives sanctity

ity training so they can better un-
derstand the problems the in-
mates face.”

Vocational training and drug
treatment are also important in
rehabilitating prisoners, said
Davis.

“Eighty per cent of the inmates
in New York are drug addicts who
must steal to support their habit,”
he said. “Presently there is little
in the way of drug rehabilitation
or job training available to them.”

-hqlnsane, irrational, and inhu-

mane.

, Attorney William Kunstler used
‘these words to describe Amer-
ica-"s prison system at a press con-
‘_.ference here Friday.

-V Defining prisons as a “kind of
{microcosm to the ghetto,” Kunst-
 - ler said, “Our society is dedicated
 to the principle that you must de-
' stroy some people. The prisons
. -‘are effective for this.”

After blaming Americans
_ for ignoring the “inhumane”
A treatment carried out in prisons
‘‘ today, Kunstler declared, “If a
 society is going to base itself on

to be overthrown.”

Prison uprisings were condon-
ed by Kunstler as a means of in-
creasing awareness of conditions

' in prisons and as a means to pris-

, have radicalized people on the
1 f outside. And I hope that prisoners
.. get very radical,” he said.

But’ Kunstler’s words did not
matchhis calm tone of voice. His
hands were folded resolutely on
I the table in front of him, and he
x  maintained a steady gaze with his
' audience.

When questioned what conse-
quences the Attica uprising would
hold for prison reform, Kunstler

said, “Attica has made it better
for some prisoners._At least some
prisoners understand that there is
a way to fight back.”

However, in New York state
_it’s (Attica) made things worse,
 -since the conflict is now a person-
al one between guards and in-
mates,” the attorney noted.

suit.

“I’ve reduced my needs in the
past year,” Kunstler interjected
,as he told newsmen his income
came from his writing and lec-
tures, not legal cases.

“Because the American people
wonder where I make my money
I wish I could say that I go,down
to the boat and get it from Castro
and the Soviet Union,” Kunstler
joked.

Kunstler announced that he was
“against all state related rehabili-
tation programs” in prisons as

:7

they presently exist. “Rehabilita-
tion should be up to the prisoner
himself,” he said.

The attorney explained that
prisoners receive parole credits
for making license plates but are
not encouraged or credited _for
taking outside academic courses.
“It does nothing for the prisoner,”
Kunstler commented in a sarcas-
tic tone.

As for the extent of prison re-
form, Kunstler clarified, “Pris-
oners don’t need a country club.
All I ask is that prison be a hu-
mane place.”

Since then, Johnson said, “chap-
ter~s have -been rising.-.all. over,”
particularly in the South.

An attempt to establish a chap-
ter in Pittsburgh was made in
1968, but due to lack of assistance
and failure to meet a member-
ship minimum of five, the effort
was unsuccessful.

The second endeavor, which
came a year later, proved fruitful,
when members Jackie Clayborn
and Joan Poellnitz met with sis-
ters Terry Vincent, Yvonne Mill-
er and Tina Perrin.

“They (Terry, Yvonne, Tina)

- game information on pledging and

what the sorority is about,” John-

son said. “We were interested last i

year, but we couldn't get enough
girls together until September.”

The functions of Zeta Phi Beta,
Johnson explained, are to provide
“a group of young ladies willing
to serve the (black) community,”
and to furnish “a closeness and
bond among -the pledges.”

Currently, the women of Zeta
Phi Beta participate in a tutoring
project at Schenley High School.

“It’s not only for tutoring,”g
Johnson asserted, “but to estab-
lish relationships with young peo-
ple.

“This is our first project,” she

added, “and we hope to branch
outfurther.” '

The chapter, which boasts a
‘membership of 13, is‘ actively

seeking recruits. “We are talk-'

ing to girls) and telling them what
we’re about,” Johnson said.

Commenting ‘on what makes
her chapter stand out from other
sororities, Johnson said, “We are
unique in the fact that we’re new.
It’s the first chapter in the city,
and all the girls are very excited
about it.”

In addition to Johnson, officers

rer Patricia Baker.

"‘At first,” said MacGiolla, “the
soldiers were welcomed by the
Catholics but when (summer
1970) in their pacification ef-
forts they searched only Catholic
areas and searched them roughly,
they became the enemy.”

MacGiolla stated that the Bri-

tish Army was there and did not

_ interfere when 500 Catholic
homes were burned.

Since August, 1971, MacGiolla
said there have been 1,000 sus-
pects interned by the British
Army without trial in Belfast,
and 500 placed in concentration

camps outside of that city. He)

accused. the British Army of us-
ing torture on prisoners to get in-
formation about IRA leaders and
using “common guerilla tactics.”

situationin Southern Ireland, the
Republic of Ireland, claiming that
the condition there‘ '= =* F-is 4" ' =no‘t“on‘e

Britain, he said, holds the eco-

ed MacGiolla, all of Ireland is
subject to British imperialism.

He asked that America use her
influence to exert pressure on

Britainto end the internment of

suspects without trial.

He also said that the United
States should withdraw from

Apparently, “Janey” had flunk-

the lowest track, the “slow”

track. Bu_t her first day-of second.

grade“ (she didn’t rejoin her first
grade classmates. Instead, she
was moved across the hall to an-
other section——the bright section.
It had taken a year of observation
and. testing for her teachers to
realize there ‘had been a tracking
mistake. ‘

Janey was lucky. She benefited

' from the,animal known as ability‘

grouping, anadministrative tech-
nique which matches children of
comparable abilities and places
them in the same curriculum.

Ability grouping was American
education’s answer to the Sputnik
sca-re. After Sputnik’s launch, ed-
ucators believed that the Russian
'educational« system‘ was turning
out super-brains. Attempting to
«catohnupaandcnpullll raheadmof -the
Russians, American educators
began to concentrate on the bright
child. Ability grouping, singled
him out and kept pushing;-him
ahead. ' E

\ But even as the Sputnik scare"
‘wore off, ~ administrators found

ability grouping a handy schedul-
ing technique. Block students into
groups, schedule each group’s
curriculum on one track, and
quite conveniently, there will be
no schedule conflicts.

A leading expert on ability
grouping is Dr. Glen Heathers of
the School of Education.

Dr. Heathers, with amonkishly
balding head, sat surrounded by
volumes of books and folders. Not-
ing that a student’s self direction»
is vital, Heathers outlined three
ways to achieve it.

First, he said, a student can
move ahead through the _use of
highly structured educational ma-
terials. These programmed ma-
terials have cues for progress
built in. A student reads the materi-
al, fulfills all required steps and

A then checkshis own progress;

Second, said Heathers, people

often forget children teach one
_ another. There are some things

upper grade children can teach
those in lower grades. Children
learn from their parents. In-
stances where children learn

without their teachers, said

Heathers, have to be explored.

' The _'highest level .is reached
when a student is able to plan his
own learning. When he is not de-
pendent on programmed materi-'
als or his teacher’s direction,
ability ‘grouping becomes irrele-
vant

Heathers noted, They_ see what
others are doing, and they judge
their own work accordingly. ' ’ .
While discussing teacher moti-
vation, Heathers cited a Califor-
nia study, “Pygmalion in the
Classroom.” It suggests that abil-
ity grouping, or tracking, can hurt
a student in a lower trackvbecause
‘it effects his teacher’s motivation.

Teachers were told they had a
section of bright students, when
the group really consisted of slow
learners. IQ’s-were measured, at
the beginning and again at the end
of the school year, and it was
found that IQ’s increased signifi-
cantly, in some cases as much as
30 points.

Unfortunately, these statistics
have never been duplicated.

Heathers noted that ability

grouping can sometimes be detri- 

mental to students in lower
tracks. Continued failure, cons-
tant ostracism, low expectations

of a teacher, tliill rou_tide"a‘nki"low-

er motivation can stiffle a stu-
dent’s learning ability.’

American education is respond-
ing to some of the deficiences of
ability, grouping. Heathers, who
likes individualized _instruction,
pointed out that education is con-
cerned with individuals, and indi-
viduals have needs which vary.

“Differentiated instruction is
important to all instruction,” he
concluded.

At Liberty School in Shadyside,
I observed such differentiated in-
struction. . _

Liberty School’s grotuping is not
the regimented grouping of IQ
tests orhardened tracking. Every
morning .a child reports to his
“home base,” a heterogeneous
group designed first as’ a social
group: a mixture of good leaders,
and followers, aggressive and shy
children. In deciding his home
base, teachers not only ‘consider
the child’s personality, but the
personality of the entire group, as
well as the. teacher’s personality.
Principal Betty Radvak stated,
“A school is not just'the place a

child comes to learn. It’s where"
he lives.” A sign hanging near her -

“ll :1 child lives with acceptance L

and friendship A _ f  V
He learns to find love in the wo'rlcl.'’

‘ Radvak explained that crises in a

child’s life (anything from the
death of his dog to desertion by
his dad), and natural learning
lags must be considered in the
grouping process. Teachers at
Liberty pay particular attention
to the learning aspect of a child’s

personality. They want him to

say, “Ifm working at math” in-
stead of .“I can’t do math.”

Finally,
teacher observation, and, to some
extent, diagnostic testing, teach-
ers group children at different
academic levels.

Through this system, the posi-
tive aspect of a child’s develop-
ment is always stressed. If a child
has difficulty withone part of the
curriculum (e.g. mathematics)
that is no reason to restrain him
in another(e.g., spelling).

“-rue llhrrEEim'§ntsogncn'

Radvak outlined the three re-
sources the children use: pro-
grammed materials, each other,

, and their teachers. / "

She ‘also explained Liberty’s
math counseling program. Teach-
ers work in a group; if one knows
a child is having a particular prob-
lem he refers the student to the
counseling teacher. in the team.
The child will thenreceive indi-
vidualized instruction. .

,’ ,Haley’s comment

by MIKE HALEY
Staff Columnist

l .The faculty of the Collegeof Arts and
zlsciences (CAS) is now considering a plan
to establish a new Black Studies major.

2 In my mind, the ramifications of this
proposal have not been really considered
or discussed. Is the philosophy for creat-
_, ing- this major in line with the traditional
 academic perspective or does it'go beyond
5 it?’ ’ '

, t Will a Black Studies major create the
potential for increased isolation and seg-

 dents?

  Since these questions should be answer-
ed before Black Studies becomes a major,
I interviewed Curtiss Porter, who is spon-
soring the proposal for this new major.

 “There is no’alternative to the Black
Studies major,” he asserted. “Black

ture. It develops a body_'of knowledge to
help develop black people who can handle
the black experience.” A '—

But he. also _pointed out that the pur-

pose of Black Studies goes much further
than developing _awareness of black cul-
ture. Black Studies is not just out to build
black pride.
 , Explained Porter, “We don’t deal with
.’_‘,-the rhetoric of pride. We don’t have to.
‘.‘We?re; not about the business of building
 pride, because that pride has always been
there in black people.” ’ .

‘ " According to Porter, Black Studies has
A “a much higher level of purpose in terms of
 its activist function. It attemptsto foster
'- involvement not just in academic pursuits
; but in_ the community as well;

. It equips the student with a perspective
_ , and the academic tools necessary for “con-
V‘: tinuing the development of alternative sys-
. ztems.” Black Studies gives a person, es-
gpecially a. black person, an opportunity to
_. achieve an “activist consciousness.”

 '_ However, does this philosophy of Black
 Studies follow the traditional academic
perspective? Porter admitted that it is not
followingthe classical approach. ~ 4 ‘ '

. - ' r

 

ministration of the survey in itself merited a story V»
in‘ the Pitt News. Also at that time, the Cabinet was
allocating $700 per month to the Pitt News. Percy
stressed thelatter fact, arguing that Pitt News cov-
erage of General Studies had been somewhat less
than satisfactory. He also.hinted that certain meas-
ures might be taken if the situation did not change

The story never appeared. The Pitt News did
notuconsider the story newsworthy at that point,

Soon afterwards, that allocation was cut _to >

._- During the time the survey was being process-
ed, Percy was repeatedly approached by a reporter
intere's,ted in the results—namely, myself. The re-
sults had not yet been received, he replied. But Per-
cy- constantly stressed their importance. Whenever
questioned, Percy expressed a desire that the re-

up with something like the existing aca-
demic institutions which have ignored
black people and the black experience. In-
stead we are trying to provide an academic
and activist tradition rather than reiter-
ating a simple academic approach.”

7 Along these lines of thinking we also
discussed why white professors don’t teach
in Black Studies. “In the early develop-“
ment of the department,” he explained,
“we offered a group of faculty members
outside the department a chance to offer a
course on white racism. Those professors

never followed through. We now have one
-course taught by a member of Black

Studies and a‘ white professor fro_m an-
thropology. ” /

Even though these -attempts have been
made, Porter stated that the basic reason
the department has an all-black faculty is
that there arereally no whites-.qualified to
teach.  .

 
   

“c;..;; sci» 

Questioned on what constitutes being
qualified, he answered, “.It requires a cer-

 

. tain perspective on the worldthat the av-

erage white American or white professor

.doesn’t have. It requires a certain involve-

ment in the black experience. It is possible

for a white _professor to teach in Black

Studies. But it is not probable; considering
their lack of experience to do so.”

Porter also discussed the’ reasonshe

,.felt that white students arelreluctant‘ to

take courses in Black-,Studie_s. He.said,

:“Th_e courses we .offer"are for th'e}t'otalu  ‘

decision, at this point, was not to make known the
results of a survey costing $10,000 of student activ-

Vice—Chairman of the Cabinet Dennis Dewey
concurred with Percy. When asked if administra- ~:- '-
tive pressure could effect a change in the decision, -
Dewey bluntly stated, “They didn’t pay for it.” I.
wondered who, then, could bring pressure to bear——
who had paid for the survey. Dewey agreed that
such action would have to come‘ from the students

When interviewed later, Percy said he felt-if
the survey were printed as is, the un_favorable‘com-
ments might be taken'_out of context, or rather,
blown out of proportion. He indicated that perhaps
selected portions might be publicized at a later/date

Tenthousand dollars is a substantial chunkof
- cash. If,‘.Percy is going to let it go towaste, shouldn’t _
some action be taken‘? But what? From whom? The ‘
answer lies within the General Studies student body.

Andwhat of the Pitt News? If funding is cut
due to a survey’s results, shouldn’t we be permitted 1
to know exactly why? That, ladies and -gentlemen,

ceived by whites asantagonistic to them,
but it is their lack of knowledge of what

‘ Black. Studies is which causes this ,reti-

cence. ”

He confronted the larger question of
the possible isolation of the black student
community from the rest of the University.
He‘ stated, “Black Studies is_not in isola-
tion from_the world.-We place the black ex-
perience ‘in the perspective of the world

_ experience and the world experience in the

perspective of the black experience.

- “The new major program that is being .

proposed,” Porter concluded, “makes_for
total involvement in other departments. A

student in this program would be a whole,

lot less isolated from the University than
other students _ with other majors. The
Black Studies major is designed to combat
this isolation.” -  - ~

Even after listening ,to Porter’s argu-
ments, I believe the plan to establish a new

Black Studies major is a tragic mistake,
Up to now you could justify the need to en— '

hance and study -the black experience,
when it has for too long been suppressed
and ignored. 1

So the creation of a separate Black
Studies program was anecessary’ solution
to let black people develop themselves
by themselves.

Once finding and‘ equipping themsleves,
black men and women would then have the
confidence and capability to enter all levels
of society" and equals. Or if they, reject
what society offers, blacks would be able to

. find their own ‘falternative systems.”

But the Black Studies department should
have been phased out over time. The black
experience, once formulated, should have
been incorporated into the other academic
disciplines at Pitt. - ~

This integration of white and black cul-
ture would have sparked a new vitality in
the humanities and social sciences. It
would perhaps create a better harmony
between black and white.

However, the plan to establish "a new
_Black Studies major will prevent‘any real
chancefor this potential merger. ' A

is not only academic.

Porter “implies ‘ you cannot
understand the black experience by sim-
ply knowing and studying it. Instead you
must supposedlyfeel and experience it as
well."

That is like saying you cannot under-
stand religion unless you are religious. You ,_
cannot study Greek mythology unless you
are Narcissus. And you cannot conceptual-
ly grasp thespeed of light unless you have
experienced it; .

 

This anti—intellectual viewpoint denies

the utility of the knowledge man has ac-k
" ctirnulated throughout his history. ‘With
this philosophy, Black Studies, with or_,_
without- a major, is doomed to search for _
only one brand of truth and understanding. . »

It is doomed to indoctrinate and not-teach.

In other words,‘B1‘ack Studies just sells 1

being black.

Should the University allow any course
to promote blackness, whiteness, man-
hood, Jewry, Christianity, or more tech-
nically ethnocentrism of any kind? '

Admittedly, it’s important’ to know and?

besproud of what you are. But it’s more im-
portant in these divided times to sell being
human and accept each other for what we
are, with all our limitations. This sales
pitch might sound naive, but it is the only ‘
way Americais going to survive.

 The combined forces of the Pitt Men’s Glee
7 Club, and the women’s glee club from the Uni-
' -versity of Rochester attempted to take the chill

if from last Saturday’s brisk evening through a con-

cert at Stephen Foster,Memorial.
Lately, the Pitt men have used the first half

  of the show to demonstrate their expertise and

 

V rriellowness when handling difficult material.

The second half seems to throw away gravity,

 and the more obvious discipline necessary to class-

ic material is replaced by a more subtle variety.

' ‘And it is this portion of the program the audience

 usually remembers forIthe longest time.

 

This concert was no exception.

The last half of the program was under the
jurisdiction of senior Walter Cramer. For the most
part, ;he combined stage technique and the glee

'’ club’s abilities effectively.

 

The most spectacular effect was created through

the use-of dance and “‘silent—movie”‘ lighting ef-

fects, making the dancers’ actions appear faster,

 their leaps higher, their movements flickerin
past in impressive style. ) , V

, “Joe’s Friends”, ‘the company of Steve’ Fisher,
Jules Shear, and David Redhair contributed Brew-
er and Shipley’s People Love Each Other and a

 medleywhich ‘consisted pf Findgthe Cost of Free-
if :_.,dom and Seems Like a Long Time.  

Fisher and Shear combined with John Essec-kl
and Don Katze in a strong rendition of the Wiff'en-

’-‘ poof Song '(“We are poor little -lambs_ who, have
goneastray ; . .”) in barbershop -“type harmony.

The weakest part of the program was the ad-
dition of What the World Needs Now is Love. The

A.Club’s version was the morbid piece that has been
’ aired‘ on the radio, containing grim newscasts
‘ * read overtop the Bacliarach - David score.

To this, they added a sketch about a drown-
ing child whom no one would save. One man walk-

-ed a dog, another sold ice cream, ignoring the

.~child’s plight. A black man finally saved her,

 

 

 

v- while someone made a racist comment about him.

iVVarlii‘lers wax religious

like a 3 a.m. sermonette.

One of the best numbers was Sigmund. Rom-
berg’s “Student Life,” for which members _)0l(lIlg-
ly posed as carousers. The men rolled and tum-
bled drunkenly across tables and chairs, finishing
with a last lethargic attempt at song, and then
passing out on stage. This selection best showed
off the ability of the men to create a casual at-
mosphere, but suggested a hidden discipline.

The last medley.on the program was based,

on traditional tunes, including When ‘ J o h n n y
Comes Marching Home, Shenendoah, Momma,
Look Sharp, and 01’ Man River.

Soloists Don_ Katze (Momma Look Sharp) and
Dave Phillips lOl’ Man River} rounded out the
melodies beautifully as the two tunes were inter-
posed. However, the effect was not sustained. and
OI’ Man River ended abruptly.

The women, clad in a colorful array of maxi
dresses, moved themselves not only far more com-

petent than last spring’s visitors from Wilson Col-

lege, but showed they could ..enjoy themselves on
the'stage as well. ' A

After rendering Fragments from the Mass,
Vocalise by Clara Edwards, and other more ser-
ious “ numbers, the Women’s Ensemble stepped

forward to sing some lighter pop tunes. V .- V
The Ensemble, comprised of ‘eight ‘members 1

of the women’s glee club proper, seized the op-

portunity to ham it up and add levity to the pro»
‘"‘gram with Hey, Big Spender. ‘ - '’

A Sweet Blindness was a bit shrill, and the ar-
rangement not particularly suited to the mater-
ial. But most of the women’s numbers were lively
and spirited, proving the girls could handle popu-
lar tunes as well as heavier ones.

The program as a whole was overbalanced with
religious numbers: each club did selections from
the Mass, and other religious songs also.

To top it off, the combined choruses perform-
ed two religious numbers. Even the most dedicat-
ed monk would have loved, seeing some lighter
material included, or at least a wider variety.

And if they were still set on doing religious
works, why didn’t they choose some material
which would have been more appropriate fare for
the Christmasvseason? - A » ‘ —

  Trmnhiiuser directing

I sinful, unredeemable

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Tannhauser, Richard Wagner's
opera concerning a
Knight’s quest for salvation. was
this week’s offering by the Pitts-
burgh Opera Company.

There are always many prob-
lems inherent in the staging of
Wagnerian drama and this par-
ticular production was certainly
no exception.

It frequently gave the impres-
sion that rehearsal time must have
been at a premium. Admittedly,
thiswas the premiere production of
this opera in Pittsburgh, and
problems are to be expected in a

, first attempt. There were, how-

ever, “sins“ that could not be
forgiven under any circumstanc-
es by any true Wagnerite.

The greatest musical sin of
the evening" was found in the
voice of Richard Cassilly, who
played the title role. Something
was very wrong with Cassilly,

» especially in Act One. One could

detect times‘ when he was actu-
ally clearing his throat on stage
and there were a few passages
where his tenor line was sung
an octave lower.

Cassilly, whose voice is usu-
ally wonderfully‘ dramatic in
roles such as this, was really in
trouble. One doubts his decision
to finish announced after Act One
even though matters improved
somewhat later in the opera.

Cuts are sometimes necessary
in lengthy‘ productions as this
one. There were. indeed cuts in
this performance but inthe wrong

' places. The chorus, at its entrance
into the Hall of Song in Act Two,

began to sing at the coda instead
of the beginning of the chorus.

Rather a blatant and tasteless
mistake to anyone who knows the
beauty of this particular section.
Is Mr; Karp, perhaps trying [to
tell us that his chorus '-‘members
aren’t quite up to it? A

The other blatant error and
cut of the evening came in Act

German.

  if

Three with the curious absence
of Elizabethis funeral proces-
sion. No doubt the most touching
scene of the opera, the director
evidently found it to the con-
venience of' all involved to ig-
nore it.

Offstage choruses in opera usu-
ally lose their pitch (especially
here in Pittsburgh), and our sir-
ens and pilgrims in Tannhaus-

er were no exception. The pre- ,

sence of dancing nymphs and sir-

ens in the ‘Bacchanalia’ scene

of Act One was replaced by a

psychiedelic light show in the

background instead. An interest-

ing effect to be certain, and one

which saves money for the opera»
as far as extras are concerned.

All of the scenery, including
the “light show” of act one was
made in the Municipal Theatre
of Hagen, , Germany. The scen-
ery for the Wartburg Valley scene
was devoid of both Wartburg and

‘ greenery. Instead, we were pre-

sented with a backdrop which

. looked more like old wallpaper.

Bad scenery, bad cuts, and
bad voices are hardly excusable
in this season’s productions. The

exorbitant price of tickets‘ that ‘

opera goers have been_ paying
this season should certainly pro-
vide enough money for extras
and more rehearsal time. Such
“budget” productions as this one
leads one to wonder where all
of our money is going.

Finally, and perhaps most im-
portantly, which of the two ver-
sions of Tannhauser was this
anyway? It was not quite the
Dresden version and it certainly
couldn’t have claimed to be the
Paris version.

Perhaps then, this was the Pitts-
burgh version for it bore little
resemblance to the other two.
Any operatic venture is due to
the ‘work of the company’s
ector. _' , . .

While Tannhauser‘ won his re-

' .demption at the end of the opera, ‘

it will be quite sometime before

operatic director Richard Karp, ,

redeems himself as far as his
conception of Tannhauser is con-
cerned. ‘ ‘S

“Sing a song, play guitar, make
it snappy,” once emerged as
Traffic’s request of a character
referred to as “Mr. Fantasy.”
The Low Spark of High - Heel-
ed Boys current collection of

Traffic’s “noise,” fulfills those
requirements —— and quite a bit
more.

Flowing through every listen-
ing nerve, the band refreshes
and intrigues, rather than smash-
ing one against walls of sound to
languish limp and exhausted. An
underlying pastoral tone is con-
tinually accentuated by Chris
Wood’s breathless flute and the
clean, crisp strumming of Rick
Green. The duo combine with
the floating and droning of
Steve Winwood’s distinctive key-
board touch to form the basis of
the balanced blend labeled “Traf-
fic.”

Delivered with an only recent-
ly acquired poise, Winwood’s

Monday, December 6, 197l—THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

 High speed Traffic kicks up sparks

dering on confusion. But the
rough edges melt together in a
decidedly first-rate effort over 12
minutes in length.

On the flip side the band serv-
es up the “heaviest” Traffic
you’re likely to hear, “Rock &
Roll Stew." An apt title, as the
name implies, and tastefully
done. Performed with the pro-
per restraint, it undeniably rocks.
yet will incur no damage upon
the ear.

“Many a Mile to Freedom,”
though, is perhaps the shining
track of the entire disc. An un-
derstated—-at times truly beauti-
ful—melody is sung to perfec-

 J. L. Kirby, principal assistant to the Premier of Nova Sco-

tion, eventually shifting to a
dash of rock for its grand finale.

But all too soon, the end nears.
The closing cut, “Rainmaker,”
vaguely echoes the Moody Blues
—but merely momentarily, for the
feeling is uniquely Traffic.

And one is struck by the ver-
satility of the band. Escaping the
conventional ruts, Traffic’s mel-
odies remain consistently fresh,
never approaching the trite. The
overall impression is that Traffic
is in high gear, in a release tick-
eted for considerable considera-
tion among the best of 1971.
And 40,000 headmen couldn’t
make me change my mind.

, If North Carolina ranks’ as the second best collegejbasket-

 ball team in the country, then the Pitt cagers should be number

one. Either that, or the whole ideaof pre-season ratings should

.be dispensed with.

There are a tremendous number of top-notch hoop squads‘

.across the nation. Whether one isibetter than the other becomes

a difficult‘evaluation.- How good any team is depends on person-
nel, discipline, and consistency. There are‘ great basketball
players all over the country, but whether they justify the con-
clusion that theyplay for great teams is another story.

The North Carolina,Tar Heels invaded Pittsburgh, herald-
ed by most pre-season- polls as the second best team in the na-
.  l _  tion. If they can maintain this high rat-
ing after Saturday night’s contest with
. the Panthers, then the Cats deserve a

’ berth of/ their own. Although the dif-
’ ference in the score was 15 points (the
Tar Heels won, 90-75), -that bulge hard-

Billy Knight’s home debut was

excited the crowd with several
dazzling plays.

The Panthers battled back from
a 10 point deficit in the first half
to within twotasthe halftime score
stood at 39-37. The final time that
the Panthers were in striking dis-
tance came five minutes into the
second half as Kent Scott hit two
fouls to make the score 50‘-47.

NC‘ outscored the Panthers 10-2
in the next few minutes, and from
that point the Cats were forced to
play catch-up. They could not size-

Cub hoopsters °slow’

fast breaking Cougars

by VINCE Di NARDO 1

_ Thanks to a consistent combination of a ball hawking-“defense and a
slow deliberate offense, the freshmen basketball -team bounced to its
second consecutive victory of its season.

The fresh, under the vigorous coaching of Tim Grgurich, managed
to halt a bigger and more highly geared Allegheny Community College

offense, 66-56.

The 10 point v‘idtory margin, how-
ever, doesn't. present a true pic-
ture of the intensity of the contest.
The game was up for grabs until
Mike Silverman, who netted only
four points, picked‘the most top-
portune time for a scoring burst.

With 7359 left on the scoreboard
clock, Silverman sank a master-
ful hook shot from five feet to
boost the Cubs shaky four point
lead. Seconds later, Silverman
struck again with a_short jumper
and the frosh were suddenly eight
points up.

ACC, using its height advantage
effectively, got« as close as one
point at the nine minute mark, 47-
46. But a rash of turnovers by
both squads. also had a hand in
keeping the score down. ",-

Last Thursday at West Virginia,
the Cougars were bestediby the
WVU frosh, 102-91, in a fast
break dominated game. Grgurich,
who chose not to run with the
Northsiders, altered his game

, plan slightly.

“Our defense can’t run and
grunt all of the time,” said Grgur-
ich afterward. We got tired out
there so we slowed down the pace
of the game a little.”

Fine ball handling by_both Kev-
in Aul and Doug Slhanek kept the
offense, as Grgurich put it, “mov-
ing and passing.”

With 1:12 remaining, ACC pull-
ed within six points.‘ Kizrk Bruce
arose to the task by sinking four
quick points—paving the way to
the eventual 10 point lead. Con-
necting on a jumper from the cor-
ner and twovch-arity tosses, Bruce
iced the game with :48 left.

gym Saturday. Army was victori-
ous in all.six events with their big-
gest margin coming in the paral-

Cadet Coach Frank Wilson said,
"I feel my squad performed quite
well, but slightly under what
they’re capable of.” Wilson ex-
pects his teamof predominantly
juniors and seniors to improve on
last year’s 6-3 ‘record and be

among the powers in the Eastern '

Intercollegiate Gymnastic League.

Ted Leger and Jim Rutherford,
two of Wilson’s all-around contes-
tants were the two top perform-
ers in the meet.

They combined for 76.80 points
—-over half of their squad’s total.

Leger, who is captain of the
West Pointers, tallied 38.70 with
his best events being the floor ex-
ercise (8.4) and thelong horse
vault (8.1).

~ Rutherford racked up 38.10,
with scores of 8.55, 8.25, and 8.10
in the long horse vault. floor ex-

. ercise and parallel bars, respec-

tively.

Only two events were within the
gymnasts reach. They lost both of
them.

away from taking the event.
Army gymnasts scored 8.25, 8.4,

Floor exercise is considered by
Coach Warren Neiger to be the
squad’s best event. After the gym-
men lost this event the whole af-

which the squad’ just could not

The only other event where the
