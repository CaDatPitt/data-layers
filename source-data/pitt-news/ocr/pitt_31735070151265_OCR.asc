On Tuesday, April 9, Gish

the removal of the slate system.
The removal of slates '——- groups

sible for allocating the more than $2.3 mil-
lion within the Student.Activities Fund,
initially approved the motion to table the
revisions, but unanimously voted to reject
Gish’s original proposed changes April 16.

The revisions currently awaiting a vote
by the Board do not include any mention
of the removal of the slate system.

Gish’s proposals include reducing the
number of Board candidates a student
organization can endorse. Under the
proposed changes to the_ code, each orga-
nization will be allowed to endorse three

board member candidates and apresiden—

tion of a candidate by any University of

dividual with the exception of academic
departments.” '

According to Gish, under the current
provisions of the code, there is no limit to
the number of candidates an organization
can endorse. I

“We did not want to scare off organiza-
tions from endorsing candidates because
some slates did not consist of a presidential
candidate, just three Board.members,” Gish
said, referring to the decision to allow for
four endorsements.

A N i_tes said that he voted against the mo-
tion to table the vote for the code changes
because he felt that certain_aspects of the
proposed code were not-made clear enough,
and that he found issue with late changes
made by Gish after the Board discussed

- the changes Sunday.

“I drew issue with the organization’s

endorsement speciﬁcs [in] the election
proposal,” Nites said.

He said that he voted against tabling
the motion because under Gish’s proposal,
an organization that endorses a slate that
includes a presidential candidate would be
able to endorse another candidate as well.

SGB President Gordon Louderback
agreed with Nites that the campaign en-
dorsements make for a confusing new
elections _code.

“I believe that organizations should
only be able to endorse one slate, not
candidates from multiple slates,” Loud-
erbacksaid.

_ - Board member Dave Rosenthal said he_
liked Gish’s proposed addition to the the
code because the measure would prevent
collusion between slates. I

PALLIGRAPH

 The American Dream interferes with
  progress in the United States

Rohith Palli '
Columniszf

' “For the American people can no

.more meet the demands. of today’s
worldby acting alone than Amer-
ican soldiers could have met the
forces. of afasicism or communism

- with muskets and militias,-” noted

President Barack Obama in his in-
augural address.

Internally and externally, inter-
nationally ‘and domestically, our
idealization of individuality and
‘self-suﬂiciency is stiﬂing the quality
of life in the United States.

I Perhaps the most important
issue’ that has suffered from our
culture of individuality is public
transportation. The traditional
American Dream, as lived by the

, quintessential nuclear‘ family,
- includes two cars and a two-car

garage: the evident appeal of this
lifestyle being that anyone can use

his or her car to drive anywhere in
the country at will, given enough
time and gas money. _

This absolute commitment to
individual time frames has con-
tributed signiﬁcantly to the glacial
speed by which the public transpor-

tation system in the%;United States. .

has struggled to advance. Why wait
15 minutes for the bus when I could
drive to my destination right now?
Why take a train when I could drive
myself in two hours or less?

But when we travel together, we
emit fewer pollutants into the at-
mosphere, and the onward 
of global warming slows. There
has to be a trade-oif on behalf of
individual convenience in order to
beneﬁt the good of the collective —
global warming beneﬁts no one but
air- conditioning manufacturers.

Another way in which our in-
dividualistic culture expedites the

- process of climate change pertains

' to this vision houses inwhich two-
car garages reside. According to
The Atlantic Cities, the average

- single-family home in a suburban
setting consumes almost triple the
amount of energy when compared
to the typical single-family home
in an urban, Inulti-f_amily housing
unit. A single—familyvhome in an

- urban setting uses only slightly
more than 60 percent of the en-
ergy expended in a single-family

‘ suburban home. 

This vision of independence
from the rest of society is intri-
cately intertwined with what we
imagine it means to have “made it”
in America. Most aspire to a giant
mansion in the suburbs with mul-
tiple luxury motor vehicles —— not
to a nice downtown apartment with
a fast bicycle. This is the height of
individual autonomy.

PALLGRAPH

But it’s not just individuals. Even as
groups, Americans want freedom from
requirements and the necessity to rely on
the collective. This has been demonstrated
clearly by the recent attempts by multiple
states to nullify national gun control laws.
These states are renegingbn a basic principle
of governance in the United States — when
issues in one state affect issues in another,

decisions need to occur at the national lev-
el. This is a case in which states wanting to
exercise their individuality when making a
collective decision could pose positive, more
productive results with respect to the overall
advancement of our nation.

“We have always understood that when
times change, so must we; that ﬁdelity to
our founding principles requires new re—
sponses to new challenges; that preserving
our individual freedoms ultimately requires

collective action. For the American people
can no more meet the demands of today’s
world by acting alone than American sol-
diers could have met the forces of fascism
or communism with muskets and militias,”
declared Obama. .

If we do away with our idealization of in-
dividuality and self—sufﬁciency, we can hope
to make wiser decisions forthe advancement

V of our country. In lightof the recent move to
propose military action infsyria, we carmot ,

make an appropriate call without the joint,
unified effort of not only the U.S. govern-
ment, but the entire nation. The American
people can no more meet the demands of to-
day’s world by living, driving, acting, govern-
ing or ﬁghting alone than American soldiers
could have met the forces of the imperialist
Britishwith wooden swords and cap guns.

41-13.

The final score of Pitt’s
loss to Florida State on.Mon-
day isn’t much of a sight to
behold, nor is it a sight that

‘indicates 'a positive takeaway

for head coach Paul Chryst and
the Panthers in their debut as
a member of the ACC.

But, contrary to first im-
pressions, Pitt’s loss to No. 11
Florida State did somewhat

V benefit the Panthers on the

offensive side of the ball.

Pitt entered 2013‘ with a
greatdeal of production to re-
place in its running game fol-
lowing the graduation of Ray
Graham and the departure of
Rushelshell. .

Monday, Chryst gave carries
to Isaac Bennett, James Conner
and Rachid Ibrahim. Conner
and Bennett each received nine
carries and rushed for 36 yards,
while Ibrahim carried once for
no gain.

Also in the running game,
freshman wide receiver Tyler
Boyd took three carries on end-
around handoffs for a total of
54 yards. Pitt totaled 127 yards
rushing against Florida State,
which isn’t bad against a de-
fense featuring four— and five-
star recruits at every position.

Bennett and Conner, who
are expected to take the lion’s
share of carries for the.Pan-
thers this season, registered
4 yards per carry against FSU,
which could potentially trans-

late into 5 to 6 yards per carry
against teams such as New
Mexico or Virginia. ’ S
Pitt’s backs ran behind an
offensive line that did a solid
job of holding off a strong Sem-
inole defense. Pitt’s offensive
line allowed just two sacks,

.-"“

which quarterback Tom Savage _

took responsibility for, saying
he did not get the ball out of
the backfield quiékly enough.
Returning to Boyd’s perfor-
mance, Monday’s game might
as well have been a coming out
party for the freshman.
. Boyd got early touches and
turned end-around rushes into

gains for double-digit yardage. .

On special teams, Boyd took his

first return as a Pantherfor 35 

yards from the 1—yard line with
38 seconds remaining in the
first half. Had Boyd cut to the
outside and taken the sideline,
he probably would have scored,
but he cut to the middle of the
field and was tackled by FSU
kicker Roberto Aguay‘o[ I A
Boyd returned two other

, kicks in the third quarter and

went for 20 and 16 yards to give

him 71 return‘ yards -— the most 

in the game — as well as the
longest return of the game.

In the passing game, Boyd
to'ok advantage of the atten-
tion given to Devin Street in
the second half to’ pull in two
catches for 26 yards. A 16-yard
reception in the third quarter

 set up freshman kicker Chris

Blewitt for a field goal. ' l

and fourth sets, the team’s the numbers

“It was awesome to take a set off

Wynn continued her strong play from
last weekend’s tournament with 12 kills

This international test served as a
humbling experience for the Panthers
as they enter their weekend tournament.

Overall, Boyd racked up 151 all-
purpose yards in his Pitt debut.

In the kicking game, Blewitt made
a solid debut for Pitt as well. After the
uncertainty Kevin Harper brought to

' Pitt’s kicking game during the past two

seasons, the fact that Blewitt nailed

After the Panthers scored a touch-
down on their opening drive, Blewitt
provided the rest _of the Panthers’ scor-
ing output. Blewitt kicked in a 28-yard
field goal in the second quarter and a
39—yarder in the third.

Ofcourse, the biggest concern right
now might be the defense. But, moving
forward, Pitt fans should not worry
when it comes to Jameis Winston’s 25-
of-27, 356—yard performance against
the Panthers. And this is namely be-

cause Pitt will not face a quarterback
as good as Winston for the rest of the
season.

There’s a reason FSU is ranked No.
11., and this reason showed against
Pitt’s defense.

After the defense has a few weeks

’ to settle in and show what it can do, its
merits can be more accurately evalu-
ated —- but they can’t-be fairly evalu-
ated against an FSU team that had more
speed and talent than Pitt at nearly
