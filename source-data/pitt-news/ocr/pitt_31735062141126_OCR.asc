Tuberculosis
Tests Start  

Next W/eel<

Pitt’s annualtuberculosis cam-
paignvwill be launched next Mon-
day, when students may receive
tests free of charge.

Sponsored by the Men's and
Women’s Student Health services
in conjunction with the Pitt News,
the»-lcampaign will extend over a
period of two weeks.

Those injected must report back
within 48 hours for an observation
of the results.

If the result is negative, the stu-
dent will take a second strength on
April 21, 22, and 23 and if the re-

. action is still negative, it indicates
no disease is present.

“As one of the greatest menaces
to health of college youth, tuber-
culosis must be checked in its ear-
ly stages,” remarked Dr. H. ‘C.
Carlson, director of the Men's Stu-
dent Health service, today.

Commenting on the campaign,
Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, director
of the Student Health Service for
Women, said, “Because of the ac-
celeration of lwork, the‘ increased
emotional strain, and the decrease
in recreational activities, students
must morethan ever look out for
their healt .” l

Both ‘doctors pointed out that,

while in normal times, a person
may be afflicted with incipient tu-
berculosis without noticeable effect,
the increased strain of war _times
may lower the individuals _‘resist-
ance and quicken the process of a
disease’s development. _ ' ‘

Persons who have shown a posi-

, tive reaction in previous tests
should arrange for an X-ray, not
retake the test. If a student has
shown a negative reaction in a pre-
vious test, he should retake the
test, as such a result means free-
dom from the disease only at the

S time the test was given.

S Undergraduates
Grades to Effect
Dra ft Deferment

College students will be able to

get a draft deferment if grades are
u . I ' .
pUnder. a new regulation, local
draft boards have been ordered to
limit 2-A deferments to college
men “of good standing who show
promise .of becoming key men in
industry.” ’ ,

Students on the verge of flunking
"and those otherwise “hanging on
the borderline” cannot be deferred
from the service.

Draft boards also have been ad-
vised to checkithe academic stand-
ing of students in 2-A every [six
months and to revoke the defer-
ment at any time the college work
falls until it becomes doubtful that
a diploma will be awarded or the
student will be of value to indus-
try upon graduation.

Freshmen and sophomores are
barred from 2-A classiﬁcation. Sec-
ond semester ‘sophomores may be

. granted such deferment. .

The ruling was issued to all local
boards by Brig. Gen. Lewis B. Her-V
shey, national selective service di-
~ rector.

Notice to Candidates for Degrees
Commencement Announce-
ments are now on sale at the Uni-
versity Book store at one dollar
per dozen. As the supply is lim-
ited, seniors wishing to buy them,
are urged to do so at once.
Since these are announcements
rather _than invitations, it is sug- ,
gested they be mailed so as to ar-
wrive after commencement exer-
cises, otherwise the recepients
pay expect the seniors. to. pro-
.,tickets for the exercises.

 

   

By IRWIN ROSEN

Facultyinvestigation of last Wednesday’s elections, sug-
gested ﬁrst by an extra issue of the Pitt News and demanded -
by leaders of the closely defeated Independent party, will be
conducted today at 3 :30 o’clock in 1209 Cathedral.

The committee which will make all decisions concerning the con-
tested election is composed of Dr. George Crouch, Dr. Ben Williams,
Mrs. Agnes -Lynch Starrett, William Seyler, lean Brink, and the acting’
deans of men and women, Theodore W. Biddle and Helen Pool Rush.

This committee was set up by the offices of the dean of men and
womensthrough the authorization of SFA", to investigate Independent
charges of fraud at last Wednesday’s election. .

This committee will have the power to decide whether or not fraud
has been committed, and, if fraud has been committed, what rectifying
measures are to be taken. 4 ‘ . i

It is probable that there will be. another election, in which stu-
dents will vote on the “equal representation’? amendment alone.

As the Independents, led by Hiram Milton and high-vote getter
Aldo Icardi, prepared the case which they will present to the committee
this afternoon, they announced their immediate plans to the Pitt News.

Independent Plans

The Independents will:

1. Settle for another election without an investigation in the in-
terest of saving time, and of conducting an election while the “fraud”
issue is still hot before the student body.

2.
if the investigation establishes fraud. Should the claims of the lndepend- \
ents be» proven correct, they will insist on a reversal of the decision on
the “equal representation” amendment. ’

3. Not accept an election held later than next Wednesday. Next
Wednesday is April 15, the date grades are handed in and ﬁnal exami-
nations are over for seniors. . .

4.. calm -
Pazpzfial? W4?

 

A student-faculty-administration committee has been
appointed to investigate Independent charges of fraudulent
voting by fraternities.

But what this afternoon’s meeting will decide is of far
greater importance, is of vastly more signiﬁcance than the
issue of “fraud or no fraud.”

It is a deeper issue than Fraternity or Independent. To-
day’s investigation will decide whether or not student gov-
ernment is to continue at the University.

 For the Independents, if denied an immediate re-vote on
the “equal representation” plan, will resign from--SFA. This
means that SFA will have abolished itself. ‘

' If the fraternities attempt to continue (SFA without the
Independents, student interest in student government will
be nil. There will be no more representative student govern-
ment. .

Neither students, faculty, nor administration wants the
death of student government, which must certainly come
about unless anothervoting day is soon forthcoming.

* =1: .;l<

It has been spitefully rumored that the Pitt News, be-
cause of its intense interest in this campaign, is partial to,
and is dominated by “Independents.” A v C «

This is untrue.

The Pitt News, as a publication representing the entire
student "body, is neither fraternity nor Independent/with a

‘ capital I. The Pitt News is quite independent of both parties.

But we do have our partialities. ’ '

We’_re prejudiced against fraud and double-voting.
We’re interested in the creation of a representative student
government in which the students share the responsibility of
intelligent participation in the affairs of the University. ,

We’re biased against the destruction of student gov-
ernment at Pitt. We’ve taken sides. The side of student gov-
ernment against those forces which are aiming, consciously
or unconsciously, toward its destruction. .

Fraudulent ‘voting has shaken SFA, has shaken student
government. , s '

And if SFA is weak and easily shaken it is because -in
the past years, fraternities have not seen ﬁt to share the
responsibility of student government with Independents.

It is a case of fraternity control, and non-Independent
participation, weakening the foundation of student govern-
,ment at Pitt, until that foundation, battered by‘ charges of
fraudulent‘ voting, stands ready to crumble.

Whatever the Pitt News is against--it is FOR honest
student government. \

What they want, the nine elected Independent members of SFA will
walk out of the assembly, as they have done earlierthis semester. .
_ Mzlton. will appear before the committee this afternoon and present
emdence which he has been ga.the-ring during the past week. He will
charge the fraterm'tz'es with fraud, basing his accusation on the fol-
lowmg grounds: ‘ ' «

The battleship committee exi-
pressed themselves as “extremely,

week in the campaign of the de-

smashed all previous records and
established the University as the
foremost school in the nation in
the sale of defense stamps and
bonds. ' ‘

The single day's sales, $2,-

‘The Mopon ls Down~'--  
5teinbecl<’s Latest   Novel 

John ‘ Steinbeck’s newest short

‘novel —— ‘.‘The \Moon' Is Down” —

opened on Broadway last night. It’s
80 percent Steinbeck and 100 per-
cent drama, and despite the ads,
isn’t‘so hot.

This is the story of invasion,

how the twelve-man army of a’
small town somewhere is disposed-

of, its quisling storekeeper brushed
aside, and its mining resources ex-
ploited by the army of the “time-
minded people” from somewhere,
-the people —who ‘-‘hurry toward
. their destiny as thoughit would not
wait,” and in doing so “push the
rolling world alcing with their
shoulder." - »

VVhile the moon is downthis in-
vading regiment uses up its ener-'
gles carrying out orders from the
general staﬂ’ at home “in the capi-
tal.” It is not the story of the real
Gestapo terror'that waylays all of
Europe, but of the otherwise nor-
mal and humane invaders to help-
less victims, but of the otherwise
helpless victims of the orders of the
day. ‘

Steinbeck has

created a fair

story, although a ﬂop when com- ’

_ pared ‘to his earlier books. His
[prose and his casual, economical
style, have together :fashioned. a
gimple, sharp picture of how force

, and brutality have shifted the nor-

Hmally free-living in much of the
world. But he has failed in the at-
tempt to concentrate or even re-
produce in the life of this town a
picture of the stunted and dark
lives of the peoples of Europe to-
day.

This may be a good, stiff morale-
bracer ,but aside from its merits as
cardboard Broadway, it's a little
too gay and picturesque, like Hem-
'ingway’s early war stories. It

‘seems rather doubtful‘ that the

Czechs and~Poles are cajoling the
German army and Gestapo into in-
fnanity. The war is a little more
serious than “ﬂies capturing two

Requirements for enlistment are:

age,’ 18-26 inclusive at appoint-
ment. (Pai-ents’ consent- if a min-
or.)
’ The physical examination re-
quires 20/2O vision in both eyes
and normal color perception;
height for pilots 64 to 76 inches;
bombardiers and navigators, 60 to
76 inches.

A new “screening” test will be
given to all applicants for air crew
training as bombardiers, pilots, and
navigators. There will be no ex-
emptions because of college credits
earned.

The ~test,_in which the applicant '

will choose the correct answer from
ﬁve possible answers given for each
question, is designed to determine
the applicant’s ‘ﬁtness’ to pursue

successfully the coursesof instruc-..

tion in the training schools.
No evidence of prior formal edu-
cation is required.
Applicant must be a citizen of
the US at. least 10 years ‘immedi-

ately preceding appointment. Mar-.

ried men are eligible provided they

‘have sufficient means of support.

Pay as a cadet is 75 dollars a
month plus one dollar a day ration
allowance and lodging, clothing,
medical and dental care, and
10,000 dollars life insurance while
in training; as second lieutenant,
245 dollars a month including al-
lowances. Upon original commis-
sion, an initial uniform allowance
of 150 dollars is given.- A
.The applicant is not liable for

selective service from day of actual
enlistment; can probably obtain
postponement while application is
considered, at the discretion of the

lead— us’ to think that dropping
pretty packages of dynamite-
bombs would win the war. Perhaps
the mild wool-pulling he is guilty
of is the best" propaganda tech-
nique, but if the reviewers think-
this is strong stuff, they’re over-
dosed. ' ' ' ' '
Despite all the ballyhoo that “The
Moon Is Down” has and will get,
we think a much more dramatic
story of occupied Europe is told by
the White Book that was quietly‘

issued by the Polish Government-

to break and rebreak every IF

The Phi Delts will rely mainly

Pitt Golf Teen}
To Begin Drills

Pitt’s golf team is once again
getting ready to -try to come
through with a winning season.
Never in the golﬁng history of the
University have the Blue and Gold
divot diggers been able to ﬁnish
any higher than the 500 mark‘.

However, this season with "four

of, last}. _year’s varsity sextet back,
the pigtlook for the coming season
looks‘ brighter than at any timefor
a long number of years. Only Bob
Seybold and Jack Glenn of last sea-
son’si500 record squad have grad-
uated. This leaves coach Art Un-
derwood Bill Kramer, Harry Simp-
son, Jim Butcher, and Bob Walki-
shaw to work with.

Along with the four returning
lettermen, Underwood has Steve
Bilowich, former Turtle Creek
star, to help himmold a winner.

The local season opens April 21
against Carnegie Tech and closes
May 27 with Grove City. I-n be-
tween these two dates the annual
Eastern Intercollegiate Golf Asso-
ciation tournament, at which the
Panthers have only had fair suc-
cess, will be held.

base, Fisher on second, Wilner at
third, Vaiksnor at short, and De-
Iong, Copetas, and Feldstein in the
outﬁeld. Zukas will probably han-
dle the catching duties with either
Ranii or Wilk on the mound.

All of which spells defense.
Brown is a clever ﬁelding ﬁrst base-
man, but hisbatting as of last year
is something else. He batted .040
the greater part of the season and
ﬁnally wound up with a .127 mark.

Fisher and Wilner are new, but as A

yet have not burned any holes in
the Stadium with their batting.
Vaiksnor, one of the two returning
lettermen, is one of the few mem-
bers of the club who has indicated
that he can do more with a bat than
just hold it. Last year he batte

Sophomore Netters Biol  
For Varsity Tennis Posts

With the opening of the varsity
tennis season less than two weeks
away, competition amongst the as-
pirants for a place on the squad
continues this week. Playing a
round robin series, the sophomores
are battling each other for one of
the ﬁve chances to face the letter-
men in intra-squad play, just be-
fore the season opens. A

Of the players out for. the team

for the ﬁrst year Jimmy Deutel-'

baum looks like the best bet for

a varsity post. At present he has -

won six matches out of six in the
round robin series. In 1939, before
coming to Pitt, Deutelbaum was
runner-up in the city champion-
ships. ' ‘

Other new men who ‘appear to
have the inside track for a ﬁrst
string place are Jack Lundell, Bob
Gaylen and Jack Ellis, all of whom
have shown suﬂicient tennis talent
in the opening of'the round robin
competition to warrant further
consideration as possible regulars.

Five lettermen are back from
last season’s mediocre outﬁt. They
are Dick Trimble, Henry Grance,

Investigation . . .

continued from page one
Fraternity watchers slipped into booths and voted.
Watchers misinformed voters by telling them that they could not
vote for the amendment on the machines.

Watchers permitted a. fi-aternity voter to vote with only one-half
an identiﬁcation card. The side containing the picture was missing.

Watchers attempted to deprive people of their vote by punching
their identiﬁcation card at the beginning of the line, and then denying
them their vote at the booth, because they card had been punched.

Upon thse claims the Independents will base their accusation of

fraud this afternoon.

Fraternities Will Answer

r

Meanwhile the fraternity leaders had not yet (as of late Monday
night) decided exactly what they would do.

The Pitt News contacted fraternity chiefs Dick Mansﬁeld, (lF coun-
cil president); Ed Tait, (SFA president); Hillard Kreimer, (Elections
Committee chairman); Gus Wilde (Fraternity nominee for SFA presi-
dent); and Jack Stauff.

. Mansfield indicated that no counter-charges would be leveled
against the Independents. He asserted that iiaternities would accept

' any ruling of the committee, and that the Greeks “can and will defend

themselves against any charges brought up.”

The others concurred in general with this opinion, although Delta
Tau Delta former president Jack Staufl’, PiKA’s Gus Wilde and Ed
Tait, hinted that the fraternities had counter evidence of fraud which
would be aimed at the Independents “when the time is ripe.”

None of the men questioned would reveal the nature of their evi-

dence, apparently preferring to hold it until this afternoon’: committee
meeting.

Meanwhile, (again, as of Monday night,) the fraternities have done
nothing to patch up the split in IF politics which caused over 150 fra-
ternity men to support the Independent amendment. Chief insurgents
along fraternity row are the Phi Kappas, peeved because Charles Cusick,
former fraternity nominee for SFA president was shelved for Wilde,
in order to draw the PiKA’s into the Greek political circle.
