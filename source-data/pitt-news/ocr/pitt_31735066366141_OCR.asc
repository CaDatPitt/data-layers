  Thieves Break Into Owl Office’
   ‘In Third Attempt This Year;

is

,/

The office of the Owl, the student year-

’ attempt to steal a shipment of valuable
photographic equipment. " _
Mel Stein, business manager of the 1966

 Owl, entered the office 11 a.m. Monday and

found the door to the photography closet
pryed open. This is not the first time the
-Owl office has been robbed. In October of
1964, the‘ office was entered, and two cameras
were taken.

During the past summer, a camera valued at
$175, belong to Tom- Carlson, photography editor
of the Owl, was taken from the office. Fortunate-

‘ ly, the new shipment of cameras received by the
Owl were safely locked aw.ay. Only some photo-
graphic paper of ‘little value was taken this time.
However, Stein said, “Whoever it is always seems
to know [when he have something valuable in the
office.” i , _

Ste-in added that the main door to the office.

at 400 SU, had never, to his knowledge, been forced

open, but that “somebody has always had a key
to the office, or the lock was picked.”

,.“It’s easy to get_ a key to an office in the build-

ing," he remarked. He explained that all one has

to do to get a key to the Owl office is to present

xi‘ ',_a.student_ identiﬁcation card or some form of iden-

tiﬁcation, showing that he has something to do
with publications, such as the Photo Club.
‘ When asked about the security in the building,
Stein said, “The only time, I am told, that there
-isia guard in the building is on weekends.”
He also stated that over the past few years

I - security has decreased. This was conﬁrmed by

- William G. Fisher, director of the physical plant.

DOOR T0 Owl office reveals the destructive work
of unsuccessful thief. Although he broke into the
office, the thief was unable to complete his mis-
sion, since all of the valuable equipment was not
in the cupboard.

Fisher attributed the decrease in security from
last year to the “general economic program of the
Universitly.” "

Irving Rothman, director of Student Publica-
tions, set the total value of cameras used by the
Owl at $400. Since this is the third robbery of
the Owl office in one year, Rothman believes that
the insurance company would probably drop the
Owl's insurance as .a poor risk if another robbery
occurred in the near future. Rothman also felt
that “we are not dealing with amateurs but pro-
fessionals.” ‘ 5

Trustees Reverse
Earlier Decision

The Allegheny Observatory will remain open this year, 
according to the University’s trustees. This decision Was"
made despite former Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld’s-'~
statement of January 1965, that the Observatory would beg‘
“phased out of operation.” The Observatory has been part‘ ‘_
of the University since 1865.  

Cancellation of the Observatory’s $50,000 ap-
propriation was a dictate of the University’s econo-
my drive. Dr. Litchfield cited the Observatory’s
“outmoded program” as a basis for the decision.

Dr. Nicholas Wagman, director of the Observa-
tory, is optimistic about its future. The $50,000
University appropriation for the Observatory pass-
ed, and Dr. Wagman feels that the $25,000 sub-
sidiary bill now under consideration in the State
Legislature will be approved. He .also anticipates a
subsidy from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.

‘.-.(_

Last year, Dr. Lltchfield suggested that the 0b- ,7
servatory obtain funds ‘from non-University soure 
ces, which would be interested in supporting the 
community services of the Observatory more than 
the research activties. ' ' b‘ 

In reply to an allogation thatythe work at the 
Observatory is irrelevant, Dr. Wagman said that
“in this modern space age, the work couldenot be 
more relevant.” _, O’ ’

Dr. Wagman was asked if he felt that the sta-
tus of the Observatory, with respect to the Uni-

“‘“ " versity, would improve now that Dr. Litchfield, ~-
who had been critical of the Observatory’s program, has resigned. ‘
He replied, “No. Litchfield’s henchmen are still around."
Joseph Colangelo, director of public relations at the Univer- ;
sity, spoke of is recent study by “some of this country’s leading ___;.,_
astronomers, which stated that the Observatory was not doing fron- 
tier ,research.” - ' :"‘-0.;
Colangelo‘ himself noted that “the Observatory is still by-and
large outmoded. There are no plans by the University‘ for the alle-
viation of the Observatory.” ‘  

    
  

Frat Loans 

by NANCY. FUCHS
The ﬁve dollar activities
fee added to the academic in-

graduates this fall is en-
meshed in a web of student
confusion and controversy.
The passage of last week’s Stu-
dent Government bill setting up
an Appropriations Committee for
the fee was the most recent in
a series of events which began
several years ago.
Two years ago Student Govern-
ment (SG) and the Student Af-
fairs Committee, an advisory body
to .the Vice-Chancellor of Stu-
dent Affairs, discussed the possi-
bility of an activities fee. Presi-
dent Affairs Committee is com-
-posed of the President and Vice-
President of SG, the resident of
seven major campus organiza-
tions, chairman of housing board,
and faculty and staff members.)
Such a fee would supplement
the University appropriations to
student activities.

The proposal provided for a
committee of five Senators to be
appointed by the SG President
with the approval of the senate.
The President, -with the approval
of the senate was to select one of
‘those five to be chairman.

The Vice-Chancellor of Student
Affairs, the ﬁnancil adviser to
SG, and another. full-time staff
member were to serve as advisers.
The senate was to approve all al-
locations set by the committee.
There was no mention of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee in the
proposal because Senators felt
that the power of selection and
control ‘over an Appropriations
Committee did not belong to the
Student Affairs Committee.

In a parallel action the Student
Affairs Committee decided that
it should allocate the funds from
the proposed student activties fee.
The Committee prepared a letter

vanccs toward her, he is satisfied
simply to have her at his cottage
as part of his collection. He enjoys
having occasional conversations
with her and watching her draw
in her elegant cell. The plot cli-
maxes when he insists on having
her around “just a little longer”
after the end of the four weeks.

The Collector spends too little
time ‘on developing the young
man’s motivation for the kidnap-
ing. -We see him as obviously
disturbed and incapable of hav-
ing normal love "relationships

are only occasional spots where
we learn of his inhibitions about

ings that any girl who participates
in them is somehow “dirty.”

Of the girl, we learn even less.
There are - moments when she
discusses her relationship with
other men, but she could be one
of the million personalities who
fits into the category of a young
girl passing from adolescence in-
to womanhood.

Yet The Collector is still an en- '

trancing cinema experience. The
magnificent acting of Stamp and

beauty. At one point she hits
Stamp on the head with a. shovel
in an escape attempt. Unable to
hit him a second time as the blood
rushes from his head, Miss’ Eg-
gar skillfully captures her fear
and compassion in her expression.

Unless one had an extremely
benevolent nature he wouldiprob-
ably walk away gritting his teeth
as he ‘thought of Stamp. But it
should not be forgotten that con-
sidering how little the script gave
him to work with, Stamp still
creates a\ very believable charac-

mood of this disturbed mind with
unrelenting excellence. In the
dinner scene, he is elated when
Miss‘ Eggar accepts his marriage

scenes shot outside Stamp’s coun-

Committee
Sets Policy

A student library committee is
in the process. of being formed,
according to Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs Helen Pool Rush.

The purpose of the committee,

cross-section of students, is to
aid the Library Oﬂfice in certain
areas of policy, such as determin- '
ation of library hours. The‘ com-
mittee _is also intended to provide
a channel for expression for stu-
dent problems relating to the li-
' brary.

The group would meet period-
ictlly with Dr. Clarence Stone, di-
rector of university libraries, to
exchange views.

The idea for such a student
group came_ from Dr. Stone, who
informed Miss Rush of his pro-
posal this summer. She then ad-
vised Student Government Presi-
dent Eric Stern, who will ‘be re-
-sponsible for forming the actual

The end they are seeking is developing a student government respon-
sive to and able to serve student needs. The immediate need is the appro-
priation of the activities fee, which all campus organizations have backed
and all full-time students have paid.

If Stern is seeking the elevation of student government, he will accept
those "means the Senate has endorsed. He will not use his pocket veto. He
will‘ not be stubborn at tomorrow night’s meeting. He will take the motion
and use it as a tool. , it A . _

He will use the allocation of the activities fee as proof the Student V
Government is capable of major responsibility. Then there will be some
ground to argue for the abolishment of the Student Affairs Committee.

PPP Reaffirms
Active SG Goal

Editor, The Pitt News: .
The Pitt Progressive Part

(PPP) was formed last spring
with the underlying philosophy
that Student Government (SG)
must be an active bargaining
agent for the student body. For
the ﬁrst year, the terms ~. “stu-
dent control over student affairs,”
“student autonomy,” and “stu-
dent rights” were called out by
student leaders. ‘

40’! Schenley

By Alex D’Ippolito

S0 DR. LITCHFIELD is gone. What of
it? He had his successes and he had his
failures. He was widely liked andhe was
just as widely disliked, because, as Chaucer
put it, “The more exalted such a man may
be, so much the more contemptible »is he.”

No one intends to burn incenses before

his image. The history of the University K

did not start nor will it end with_ him.
Whether ﬁnances were his tragic ﬂaw,
Achilles Heel, or just a plain “goof” does
not really matter now. It was a mistake and
he paid for it—but not without leaving his
permanent mark on the University.

At the height of the barrage of criti-_

cism hurled at him this summer one_stu-
dent was led to say in ‘his defense, “L1tch-
ﬁeld is the best friend a scholar could _have.”
This then is -his mark—the best friend a
scholar could have, and for this Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld, .‘.‘Thank you.” ~ I ,

LET THE others debate the wisdom of
his policies or the magnitude of -his errors.
As for me Ijust want to offer him my.
thanks for having the courage and vision
to dream and plan and work for greatness;
thanks for setting a standard so high that
even he couldn’t reach it ;. thanks for doubt-
ing himself but not his ideals; thanks for
showing that “Low aim, not failure, is the
.crime;” thanks for giving me something
that a balanced budget by itself could not

. have given.

,. The University is still here. Able and
dedicated individuals have already begun
taking over the JObS that Dr. Litchﬁeld,used

to perform. Classes will go on as scheduled, -

the Cathedral will remain standing, there
will still be football games on Saturdays,

students will continue to grumble, profes-

sors .wi1l,.come—,and go.  " s  W. '

Although only two full senate
meetings have been held-, already
SG has taken a great step‘ for-
ward. For the ﬁrst time, the ele'cl-
ed representatives of all students
will have a role in allocating
money to student organizations.
For the ﬁrst time, SG is on ‘the
road to becoming a real student
governing body. --

During the rrbnths ahead, the
Pitt Progressive Party)/will be
attempting to initiate programs
in every aspect of student life. A
strong SG, which the PPP is at-
tempting to build, will not be
satisﬁed with passing resolutions
and study committees. Action
will be taken for the student
body. .

A, Specifically, bills are presently
being prepared to liberalize vis-
iting hours in the dormitories, "to
study and possibly revise the dis-

tribution of studies system, to’

work with the city government
in obtaining student - discounts
for the commuting students, and
to improve the library hours.

These are a few of the pro-
grams being initiated by the Pitt
Progressive Party. However, there
are problems. The vast majority
of the members of Student Gov-
ernment were not in attendance
during the spring trimester. There
are some members of Student
Government who do not agree
with the PPP’s philosophy of ac-
tion. First-rate pieces of legisla-
tion take ‘ time to properly pre-
pare.

Along with other leaders of
Student Government, the Pitt
rogressive Party is -working to
translate the phrase “student
control over student affairs” in-
to exciting programs for the stu-
dent body. We are attempting to

make the Student Giivemment a.

real Student Government, provid-
ing leadership and decisive ac-
tion for all the students.

Editor, The Pitt News:

' The news article in the Sept.
10 Pitt News may create an er-
roneous impression in the minds
of the students. There is absolute-
ly no charge for registration’ and
placement- of students (under-
graduate and graduate)‘ in part-

time and summer jobs. Unfortu- ‘
nately, you neglected to mention

‘that we are quite proud of the
fact that we had 422 more stu-
dents placed in part-time and
summer jobs during the past
year than were placed‘ in the
1963-64 year. ’ _ _

The $3.00 charge applies only
to those seniors and graduate
students who register and use
our- service in obtaining place-

’ ment in career jobs in the outside
world.

I think too, that the record
needs" to be set straight on the
impact of our budgetcut on staff
personnel in the Placement Serv-

_ ice. We ‘feel ‘that the University
administration has been gener-

ous, sympathetic, and understand. .

The security of students, professors, andiUniversity property is being jeopardized
by a‘ cut in the University security force. Captain_ William Fisher, director of the phys-
cal plant, attributed the security cut to the University’s overall economy drive.

Currently, the Student Union (Schenley Hall) is “operating without the services

of a full-tiine security officer,” according to Student Union Director Bob Loch. A. secur-

ity officer is only on duty in the Student

Union from_ 8 am. to
Sunday. ~ ~

midnight, Saturday and

T Every evening from midnight until 8 am. the next morning there is no security
check on the Union. The ﬁrst organization to suffer was The Owl, the student yearbook.
’ Although no valuable items were stolen this time, the robber had access to the

building and The Owl offices. Luckily, a $300 supply of new photographic equipment

had not been placed in the cupboard. ‘

But The Owl is not the only prey for robbers in the Student Union. There are 33

_ student organizations having offices in Schenley Hall. Among

student publications whose offices contain valuable electronic,

chanical equipment. -

these are WPGH and all
photographic, and me-

 The Dean of Men’s offices and purchasing, philosophy, mathematics, admissions,
and student aid departments are all located in the Union. Their valuables ‘include type-

writers, dictaphones, books, file cases,‘ transcripts, and irreplac

eable -records.

- The Union lobby "itself houses innumerable wealth in draperies, paintings, lamps,

 tables, catering equipment, a television, and phonographic equipment-. V
 Under current security measures, someone can hide in an office in the early even-
"; ing, make a theft, and walk out the front door after midnight, without anyone detecting
him.

A person could pull up with a truck and ramsack - the

 I noticing until 8 a.m. the next morning. The re isn’t even a patrol of any kind passing the _

 building.

building without, anyone

~ A person working late in an office could be attacked by intruders without any

means of receivinghelp. There is no safeguard.

The risk is too great to continue. If the university budget must be cut, it should

be cut at places where the repercussions can be minimized. Perhaps switching one Uni-

. versity policeman from day? to night turn. Surely one less officer patroling and towing
cars is less of ‘a sacriﬁce than the" security of the entire Student Union. ' -

The most signiﬁcant move trig-

the appointment of Dr. David

oversees all ﬁnancial operations
at the University. Dr. Kurtzman
has sewed as a top ﬁnancial lad-

Whilé Miss Rush and Dr. Kurtz—
man were elevated to the status

vice-Chancellors remained in their
positions. Dr. John Geise serves
as vice-chancellor of regional pro-

The compromise proposal call-
‘for a six-member Appropria-
tions Committee composed of four
udents, the. financial adviser to

Uhancenor for Student Affairs as
chairman. Two students were to
be selected by SG and two by the
tudent -Affairs Committee. The
senate had to approve allocations
recommended by the Appropria-
tions Committee.
The student members of the
Student Affairs Committee sent
p‘. former Vice-Chancellor of Stu-
dent Affairs, Dr. Alan Rankin, a
recommendation that students be
invoiced for a $5 activtiesi fee and
that the SG-Student Affairs se-
lected committee allocate the
_ funds from the fee.

former Chancellor Edward Litch-

ANECDOT ES
from the sports scene

Last week the football team
found out how much injuries
 will hurt them. Ed James
and Bob Bazylak were both
injured, [while Jim Alcorn,
‘,_who—quit the squad was of no

 The only quarterback the
 varsity had besides starting

' , Pohl has expressed ade-
sire to play offensive quar-

 
 
 

 
 

the University, but his ex-
cellent showing on defense

 

 squarterback Ken Lucas was

 

last year has earned him the
regular safety spot. As
should be expected, his of-
fensive. performance in the
scrimmages left something
to be desired.

The problem was short
lived, however, because Ed

- James was back in full attire

on the practice ﬁeld Monday
and Bob Bazylak seemed to
have also healed. Alcorn’s
lost may be greater than it
ﬁrst appears. P ffi

Soccer Coach Leo Bemis,
still smarting from the bad
publicity the soccer team had
last year, is_ not taking any

chances with (Pitt News) re-
porters. Bemis mimeograph—
ed sheet of information and
quotes which hehanded to
the repoter, while he was be-
ing interviewed.

Last year, soccer players
popped ‘off to a (Pitt News)
reporter and the repercus-
sions were immense. The
players wrote a letter to the
newspaper denying every-
thing they had said. And‘
Bemis was angry at what he
called “making something
big out of a little vissatis-
faction.” Bemis is being ex-

Good news for football
fans this year has been the
play of offensive end John
Verkleeren._ He has survived
three weeks of ‘grueling prac-

tice without a serious injury ‘

to the knee he had operated
on last year. Verkleeren was
on crutches for four or ﬁve
months last year while miss-
ing the whole season after
a knee operation.

Verklereen’s size, six foot-

.three and 2.05 pounds, have

prompted many to compare
him with some of the great
ends who have played at the

I Booters Stay ‘i Indoors

--— By GEORGE M. LIES
Rain muddled the soccer
team’s practice plans so far
._ . this week. Instead of kick-
 ’ ing the ball around on the
\§ dust floor of Kennard Field,
‘P which was pucked marked
 i with water. holes, coach/Bemis
 » kept his team indoors.
, Kennard Field is the booters’

scrimmage and practice ﬁeld, but V

the air becomes so ﬁlled with
dust from the loose and dry’
ground that Schenley Oval, one
of three home game sites, must
be used for home contests.
Actually, Bemis wanted to save
_  the grassless turf of Kennard for
‘  another purpose. “We stayed in-
};..‘ side at the Field House because
\ a "practice session at Kennard
, would reallyleave the ﬁeld in a
 éhoppy mess,” he said.

“Now we may schedule Satur-
_day’s Frostburg State game there
" instead of Schenley 0val,"*- con-

tinued Bemis. “This would put

Stewart Accepts Defensive, Role I  ,
As Possible Ben 

efit in Disguise  

Senior Halfback

- Eyes Pro Ranks

By TOM SACKS

Being relegated to de-
fense, after having been
groomed for a position in the‘
backfield would be regarded
by many as "a setb2...._.. and
even an insult. For senior
Dale Stewart it is possibly the
luckiest break in his football
career. 1 s

Despite his size, six-feet, one-
inch, 205 pounds, Stewart is one
of the fastest players on the
squad. “On any given day Crab-

tree, Dyer or I could come out ,

aheadfin the 100- yard dash,” said
Stewart. Considering Stew.art out-
weighs Crabtree by 25’ pounds
and Dyer by 30 pounds, his cre-

. dentials for the offense are im-

pressive.

The injury—prone halfback
played 247 minutes last year,
carrying the ball 25 timeslfor
100 yards. Stewart also ‘doubled
capably asa defensive left half-
back last season.

With the reinstallment of the
two platoon system and unpre-
dictable position juggling, Stew-
art drew‘ defensive left halfback
as a full time job. ~

‘Don't count him off offense
completely,” said defensive back-

ﬁeld coach Carl _DePasqua. “If-

somebody gets hurtﬁthe position
juggling might bounce him back‘
into the offensive line-up again.

“With his experience and size
and speed we decided we needed
him most on defense. Right‘ now,
along with Tippy Pohl, he’s the
best man I have,” continued De-

Pasqua. “We had the veterans in »
the backﬁeld. Without Stewarts

we would‘have been very weak
on defense.”
For obvious reasons most atten-

tion in college football is center- ’

ed on the offensive stars. Stewart
admits he'll miss the publicity,

but “I think that defensive half-
back is one of the toughest posi-
tions on the ﬁeld. The challenge
is there and I like it more than
offense.”

“There's no psychological prob-
lem in switching with Stewart,”
said DePasqua. “He has terriﬁc
spirit. ‘All he needs is a little
momentum.”

“I want to " get a chance with
the pros when [graduate and I
think I'll have the best chance
in this position,” said Stewart. “I
played defense in high school,
but everything is a lot different

" in college.

“In high school everybody used
to key ‘on the ball. Here you have
to ‘adjust to keying on your zone
or a man-to-man defense. Cover-
ing one man gives the most chal-
lenge. That’s why I’m hoping to
make it with the pros because
there it's mostly man-to-man de-
fense.”

With his ,,.eyes so" set on the_

pros, Stewart is in danger of let-
ting his mind wander away from
the immediate of playing college
ball. “That’s ridiculous,” counter-
ed Stewart. “The” most important
think now is , playing for Pitt.
TheI:e’s more spirit on this squad
than even in 1963 when we were
9-1.”

Eichenlaub, Hinchberger Elected

By RON SHEARER
\ The cross-country squad elected
Dave Eichenlaub and Don Hinch-
berger, co—captains for the 1966
season. They could not have made
a more contrasting choice. I

Both Eichenlaub and Hinchber- I

ger are Seniors. They both grad-
uated from Butler High School,
and both are of German back-
grounds. The similarities end
right there. .

in track and one in cross-coun-

season, Eichenlaub was struggling

captain, he has a real job ahead

Comparing the records of’ both

school record in the th-ree-mile

Experience is a high

football. It comes only

“Putting those sophomores in

BY JAY ROSHNISTEIN

Perhaps sophomore defen-
sive end Greg Keller is inex-
perienced. He might even be
13.. . little slow diagnosing a
particular play. But what he
lacks in obtainable football
know-how,—- he makes up in size,
strength, and speed.

At 6-3, 215 lbs. Keller supplies
the beef that effectively shuts
. ’ A oﬁ the middle from the straight
 power stuff. He also has enough
 to swing out to the side-
 lines" and force the end sweeps

to the inside. “I sure hope that
/' my lateral movement is quick
T enough to stop guys like Floyd
Little,” said Keller. “A guy like
~ Little .can make the afternoon
’ extremely long for ,.a defensive

end. "

“Those end sweeps can be mur-
der," he continued. “The defen-
hive end is supposed to strip the
interference .and still be in good
enough field position to force the
play inside. Right now, I ﬁnd it
real tough to adjust to the quar-

 ' ~terback when he leads his- back-
;-g:' . ﬁeld in a bow towards me. I tend
to move right after the quarter-
back instead of waiting for him
to commit himself. By charging
head down for the football, I al-
-low a halfback to take a simple
pitchout and go a long ways with
it”

According to Keller,‘ he learns
a great deal about the upcoming
play from the opposing halfback
or wingback. “If he leans 'for-
ward,” Keller explained, “it prob-
ably means that he will be run-
ning straight at the hole he"s fac-

    
  

I

   

 

  

ing. If, on the other hand, he is

easing back, it could very well
mean that a ﬂat or sideline pass
is probable.”
Defensive line coach John
Steigman, a devout believer in
conditioning and good, old-fash-
ioned contact, has been working
i with Keller to quicken his reac-
tion time. “There’s no doubt,”
Keller said, “that I'm starting to
diagnose plays a lot better now.
But I'm still reacting too slowly
. _— to the ﬂow of the play.’’

ﬁghter going against a veteran.
Whether the veteran's good or
bad he's still the best bet because
he has the accumulated know-
ledge of how to get around.”

Against such a realistic back-
drop and with Oregon’s 18 start-
ing lettermen, the Panthers will
be obvious underdogs Saturday.
One consideration in the gridders
favor is the high spirit currently
among the squad.

Even though spirit is no -sub-
stitute for experience, it can go
a long way to compensate for
the lack of playing wisdom. If it
goes far- enough to carry the
gridders to .an upset the momen-
tum generated might carry them
through a successful season.

Whether Oregon will take ad-
vantage of the three sophomores
in the defensive line-up is doubt-
ful. “They have a pro-type of-‘
fense and I don’t think they will
alter their strategy unless‘ they
ﬁnd a defender who obviously
cannot handle his position.”

Offensiev drills were boosted by
the return of second string quar-
terback Ed James to playing con-
dition. His shoulder had been in-
jured last week. Tomorrow will
be the last day of heavy practice,
prior to the opener.

To Learn End Position

wrong during the practice ses-
sions because he is currently
playing second-string. The start-
ing defensive end, Ed Assid, is
20 pounds lighter than Keller. So
it seems that the lack of anticipa-
tion of the play hurts Keller
more than the actual execution
of the moves. ‘

As an offensive tackle in high
school, he used to think that of-
fense was more complicated than
defense. “I couldn’t have been
serious,” Keller said with a lit-
tle laugh. “Defensive football in-
volves so much more than of-
_fense.”i

He noted that the simple act
of rushing the passer can be an
intricate operation. “On rollout
passes, the end must first watch
the outside before he can bust
through to the quarterback On
dropback type passes,” Keller
continued, “the end must‘ be able
to rush inside and outside to be
effective.”

Keller spoke with a lot of de-
termination and awareness for a
second-string ballplayer. “If ever
a team was ‘up’ for a game or a
season,” he said, “this one is it.”
