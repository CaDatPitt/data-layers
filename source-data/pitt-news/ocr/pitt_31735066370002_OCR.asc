Vol. 78, No.25

By PEGGY FERRI

The City Planning Commis-
sion approved a proposal yester-
day that seeks to relieve
overcrowding at the County Jail
by building a work-release center
for female offenders in Oakland.

Allegheny County will begin
construction on the site of the old
Nova house at Fifth and Craft
avenues. The work-release center
would house female offenders
while they finish their sentences
and offers classes and job
training.

The Program For Female
Offenders has budgeted money
for the project. The county chose
the Oakland site because it
already has ownership of the
property.

Oakland residents and other _
individuals were wary of the neg-
ative effects a work-release cen-
ter in Oakland might have.
Oakland Development Incorpo-
rated (ODI) planning commis-
sion chairman, Sandra Phillips,
outlined some of the fears that
were raised about the project.

One fear was that women at
the center would have visitors
who might cause trouble, Phil-
lips said. '

“The center, however, will
enforce strict rules about vis-
itors,” she explained. “There
won’t be any visitors except for a
few hours during the weekends,
and even then,it will only be
blood relatives or legally married
spouses who will be allowed.”

Another fear that residents
expressed was what the women

might be doing during the time
they were outside the building,
Phillips said, ‘
' “There will never be time for
them [the female offenders] to
just be out walking around,”
Phillips explained. She added
that their time in the center
would be scheduled and that
women would either be inside the
center or at their job training.
The women would also be
accompanied.on,the way to and
from their job training sessions.

tion in Oakland and other areas
and includes representatives
from the area universities. Pitt

met several times before aprov—
ing the project and is now in the
process of adding persons to an_
advisory committee which will V
watch the center’s development.

This project, if approved,
would be Pittsburgh’s f"irst_resi-
dential program for female
offenders, Phillips said. There
was some question as to how
many offenders would be housed
in the center, she admitted, but
added that because there are
some extra beds, the occupancy
could exceed the proposed '25
residents. There is 24.-hour staf-
fing at the center.

_ The center could be completed
in three months.

Computer Crack-Down

Computer

, Misuse

Prompts   Security    

By MIKE BUCSKO

Violations of computer security
and the growing number ofcases of
illegal access to computer systems
nationwide is causing local colleges

to take measures to try to monitor ~

and eliminate further violations.

The Oct. l4apprehension ofa Pitt
student who illegally plugged into
the university computer system has
raised questions about the security
of Pitt’s system as well as other col-
lege systems in the area.

The major deterrent to access of
computer systems at Pitt, Carnegie-
Mellon and Duquesne is the pass-
wor'd. Each user of the system —
student or faculty —— is given a
project programmer number (PPN)'

to gainaccess to systems at all three V

schools. The first time the user logs
on the system, the password auto-
matically consists of the last four.
numbers of the social security fol-
lowed by the middle four. The user is
then prompted to change the pass-
word to any combination of six dig-
its and letters which will be known

only to’ the user because it does not .

appear on the computer printout.
The only way someone can gain
access to the system is by knowing a
PPN and the password that accom-
panies it, according to spokesmen
from area schools. Robert E. Cape,
CMU’s computer center director,
said the major problem at universi-
ties is the large volume of users and

Pitt Professors React toGrenada

By MARTY WILLIS

The invasion of Grenada by some
1,500 U.S. Army Rangers and
Marines along with 300 soldiers
from six Caribbean nations early
yesterday marks the first use of
American combat troops in the
Western Hemisphere since 1965.

In contrast to the more indirect
military involvement now in pro-
gress in El Salvador and Nicaragua,
what is most significant about yes-
terday‘s events, according to Pitt

political science professor Cole
Glasier, is “the fact that the United
States actually did invade.” .
“The principle of non-
intervention, to which the United
States subscribes in theory, ordinar-
ily rules out armed invasions of for-
eign soil. In armed intervention of
any sort, the burden ofproof is on
the intervenor,” Blasier said in refer-
ence to the reasons cited yesterday
by President Reagan for the inva-
sion. The goals of the operation, as
cited by Reagan, included protec-
tion of-up to 1,000 American citizens

 



 

  
  
 
 
 
   
 
   
  
  
   
   

 

    
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
   
 

in the aftermath of last week’s vio-
lent left-wing coup. _

Blasier said, in a telephone inter-
,view yesterday, that the United
States would have to show that the
Americans in Grenada were in some
actual danger in order to make a
strong case for the intervention on
that basis.

“I’m willing to say that I doubt
they were in much, if any, danger,"
Pitt history professor Reid Andrews
said. Andrews said Grenada’s new
leaders “would have had to be nuts”
to even consider "threatening Ameri-

. can citizens when they knew a U.S.
Navy carrier group was heading for
the area in the Eastern Caribbean
region.

“I was not surprised. I was very
afraid that something like this was
going to happen. This is the type of
desperate thing that a government
does when it has had, across the
board, almost no foreign policy suc-
cess,” Andrews said. He described
the Reagan Administration’s for-
eign policies as relying almost exclu-
sively on military for_ce and resulting
in “one disaster after another.” I

consequent familiarity with each
other’s work that creates problems.

“The problem in a university isv

there are lots of users with lots of
accounts,” he said, “and it provides
an opportunity for people to use
each other’s passwords.”

Ray Ravida, the Pitt student who
was apprehended using someone
else’s PPN and password for his per-
sonal use, said he found the PPN
and password “scribbled” on a piece
of paper on the floor of Old Engi-
neering Hall, one of Pitt’s R} E sites.

Ravida said he was not aware he
was violating any stringent “rules,
although he admitted he was famil-
iar with the university’s computer
regulations. ,

,?‘I really didn’t know I was doing
anything wrong,” Ravida said.

Ravida said he found the “pass-
word and PPN around the middle of
September and used a printer _at Old
Engineering Hall to print approxi-
mately 80 forms for his fraternity.»
He said his apprehension by campus
police came as a surprise. "

“[It came] without any warning,” ‘

he said. “It’s a surprise that they’re

I making“ such a big deal about it.’_.’.. p .

The_‘‘big deal” is that Ravida was

using someone else’s user time, a vio- ~ '

lation that inconveniences others i
and costs the university money,
according to Allen Grandey, Pitt’s
computer center‘ operations
manager. - - *

Invasion

Andrews said that British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher has
enjoyed a rise in popularity among 4
her constituents since her country
defeated Argentina in the- Falkland
Islands war of 1982.’ He said that the
decision to invade Grenada was in
part “politically motivated” toward
the 1984 re-election campaign of
President Reagan. ' , ‘I

hoping to achieve with this is a clear-

German Speaks Out  Deployment?

/

By MICHAEL WEINMAN I

Marking the end of a week-long
series of protests in Germany and
the United States, Harold Winter
spoke before the Pitt Arms Race
Study Group, outlining his concerns
over the planned American missile
deployment. Winter, a volunteer for
the Action Reconciliation Service
for Peace, spoke in opposition of the
December basing of U.S. cruise and
Pershing II nuclear warheads.

_The Action Reconciliation Ser-
vice (ARS) is a West German peace
organization that sends volunteers

The. ARS was founded after

. isolated portions of Europe. During
the 'l970s. it supported popular
environmental groups and, like
most of the populist movements, the
ARS turned its attention to the arms
race’ in the late ’70s.

- Winter spoke on the growing sup-
port for the nuclear freeze and cited
a poll by one German television sta-

'tion which showed that 70 percent of
the German people opposed the
scheduled deployment.

‘ Winter saidhe also believes that
the police have made a distinction
between the violent protestors of the
’70s and the highjly-trained,,pacif"ists

Winter’s group supports" a total

that the SALT agreements, Geneva
Agreements or so called “build

impact on arms deployment. The,
build down proposal is supposed to
replace the number of existing war-

heads with fewer but more powerful .

weapons.
Winter referred to the 1939 non-
aggression treaty between Hitler and
Stalin, which he said ultimately
proved to be worthless. ,
Other stances taken by ,Winter’s
group include the support of unilat-

eral freezes on nuclear production; ,

Grandey said that accessibility
violations are not a major problem
at Pitt. Although he declined to
elaborate on exactly how Ravida
was discovered using the system,
Grandey said he keeps a watchful

eye for any unlawful use of the A

system.

“I assure you,” he said, “that
where I can acquire knowledge of
misuse, I’ll proceed on it.”

Grandey said he wanted to be

“very careful” when discussing Rav- 9’

ida because the computer center is

currently in the process of filing

charges before the University Stu-
dent Judicial System and he did not
want to say anything that would
constitute pre-hearing prejudice.
Grandey explained that Pitt’s

I 0 main system is the DEC-10, which is

broken into three separate parts,
systems A, B and C.

The students use systems A and B
with system C reserved for admini-

strative duties. The administrative
programming of grades is on a
separate system, a Magnuson IBM
compatible central processor, so
that students or faculty cannot gain
access to their grades by the use of
PPN’s or passwords, Grandey said.
Cape explained a hypothetical
way Ravida may have been caught
on Pitt’s system. He said monthly
accounts recording user numbers

‘and work done are received by

CM'U’s accounts administration. If
a PPN that was inactive suddenly
became active, the administration
would be alerted and would then
take action. Ravida was using a non-
student PPN that was previously
inactive. When asked about Cape’s
theory, Grandey said he would
neither confirm nor deny it.

'“I’d rather leave it a mystery,” he
said.

To alleviate further computer
misuse, Grandey said students,
faculty and computer center staff

In Centers

should be “conscientious” when
using the system. He said when
someone uses computer time for
work other than designated course
work, they are depriving others of
their rate of use because only a cer-
tain amount of units are alotted to
any one department. This is the
computer center’s major objection
to Ravida’s unauthorized system
use, even though Ravida used the
printer extensively, Grandey said.
Grandey said there are many
options about what kind of action
will be taken against Ravida. Even
though Ravida’s user number was
confiscated when he was_ appre-
hended, he was given a substitute
number for his course work, action
that followed omputer center pol-
icy, according/iio Grandey. 4
As of yesterday, the campus

police had not filed charges on

behalf of the computer centerbefore

was very easy for U.S. troops to
defeat the Grenadian army, he
added, but the hard part will be to
decide what kind of government will
replace the one that was overthrown
yesterday.

Andrews said he hopes the U.S.
does not take part in the process of
creating a new government for
Grenada “because our historical
record in this type of work is so
bad.” He cited the Somoza dictator-

vs. Popularity

On November 3 and 4, elections for members
of the Student Government Board will take place
on campus.

The field of candidates this year is commenda-
ble — four are running for president and 10 are
running for board. It’s‘always nice to see that
some students are interested in improving the life
for Pitt.’s undergraduates and want to get
involved in SGB.

That, however, is not always the case. Let’s face
it, there are some students who run justbecause
they think it will look good on a resume. Being
involved with anextra-curricular activity will be
a plus for students no matter what field they
decide to enter after graduation. I

The ones who are running should realize that
even though their involvement will look good on

‘a resume, they are also taking on an awesome

responsibility —— representing Pitt’s undergradu-
ate population. We’re not saying all the candi-
dates are "just interested in themselves,.but there
are some who are.

The SGB race is also often a popularity con-
test. Students who are involved in another inter-
est group usually rally supporters behind them,
and they come out in full force and vote for their
friends. These candidates are usually the ones
who win. Pitt students, along with the more qual-
ified student who didn’t have a large following,
are the ones who lose.

Theironiic part about it is that it is Pitt students
who have the power to vote for the most qualified
and competent candidate. But more often than
not, it’s the most popular candidate -who wins,
and this year will probably prove no different.

A lot of students also do not vote because they

‘ I either don’t care, they forget or they think it’s a

big joke. These students have to be made to real-
ize that their vote could make a difference.
.\ When the polls open next Wednesday, the stu-
dents who vote should seriously think of the con-
sequences of their choices. They should become
familiar with the issues and vote for the‘ candi-
dates they think are the best ones to handle the
issues effectively. I -
Students who have never voted before should
realize that there is a world outside of their dorm
and class rooms and that they have a stake in that

world. By voting in next week’s election, they will .

be developing good habits that can be put into
effect every November. Americans have a right to
vote, and that right should not be taken lightly.

So, on November 3 and 4, get out there and
vote for whom you think the best candidates are.

GRANADA, ‘

Israelis Not Always Innocent

Dear Editor: .

This is in reply to Zachary Gray-
son’s article in the Monday, Oct. 24-,
issue of The Pitt News. I can say that
I am all too familiar with Mr. Gray-
son and his followers’ apologetic
views in regards to Israel. On several
occasions, I have exchanged oppos-
ing views with Mr. Grayson on this

topic, and I choose to do so again.

In his letter, Mr. Grayson goes to
great lengths to disassociate Israel
and the Israeli military withytheir
complicity in the massacres at the
Palestinian refugee campsiof Sabra
and Shatilla. In doing so, Mr. Gray-
son omits a few relevant facts that
were uncovered by the Israeli
government’s own inquiry into the
massacres. This inquiry eventually
led to the dismissal of then-Defense
Minister Ariel Sharon and several
other top Israeli military officials.

Of course, everyone knows that
the massacres were carried out by
the fascist Phalange militias! But
Mr. Grayson intentionally forgets to
mention that it was the Israeli
Defense Forces that were guarding
Sabra and Shatilla and were respon-
sible for allowing the Phalangists to
enter the camps to “mop up” sup-
posed Palestinian guerrillas.

, Mr. Grayson also fails to mention
that the Phalangists were the allies
of Israel who are armed, trained and
funded by the Israeli government.
This is especially true in the case of
Major Sad Haddad, the renegade
Lebanese army commander who
controls what is known by Israel and
by Haddad’s supporters as “Free
-Lebanon."

“Free Lebanon” is actually a strip
of land in southern Lebanon which
connects with Israel’s northern
border. Haddad‘s forces are sus-
pected of being the perpetrators of
the mass murders in Sabra and
Shatilla.

Another important factor that
Grayson refuses to ackowledge is the
Israeli forces who fired luminary
flares over the camps to provide
light‘ for the advancing ‘Phalange
militias. After the killing ceased, it
was Israeli bulldozers, loaned to the
Phalangists by the IDF, which tried
to bury the bodies in mass graves in
hopes of avoiding detection of these
heinous acts. The Israeli inquiry also
uncovered that the Israeli intelli-
gence knew mass revenge killings
were being committed on civilians,
and they waited at least 24 hours to
notify higher authorities and did
nothing to stop them.

I ask Mr. Grayson how he can
avoid such rudimentary evidence

supplied by persons ideologically in .

tune with himself, unless he is
attempting to fabricate reality and
knowingly mislead people?

I deplore the hypocritical oppor-
tunism and disinformation of Mr.
Grayson, who fails to mention the
complicity of Israel in maintaining
the most fascistic and repressive
governments in Latin America and
the globe, who are the most notor-
ious human rights violators in mod-
em times. In my forthcoming article
in the fall issue of Covert Action
Information Bulletin on the role of
Israel in Latin America, I attempt to
expose Israel’s role in maintaining
such torturers as Pinochet in Chili,
the fascist junta in Argentina and a
host of" other ' international
gangsters.

And I need» not rely on obscure

journals for my sources. I have

found many pro-Israeli and pro-
Zionist sources who openly gloat

“I cannot remain
complacent an_d
allow the apologists
of Israel...to distort
the truth and spread

/ misinformation...”

‘ .

and sickeningly boast of Israel’s mil-
itary support for the protectors of
“democracy” and “free enterprise”
around the globe.

And I need not go beyond the pro-
Israeli _ government August I982
issue of the Israeli Economist to doc-
ument that Israel’s arms exports to
Latin America account for over one-
half of its total arms exports. Israel
supplies over 80 percent of the arms
to El Salvador, whose government
security forces have been estimated
by our own U.S. State Department
to have killed over 40,000 civilians
since 1979 including four U.S. nuns.

Israel is also the leading arms sup- ‘

plier to the government of Argen-
tina, whose military is responsible
for the “disappearances” of over
30,000 people since 1976, including
many Jews.

Add to this list the government of

»Guatemala, whose two successive

military dictatorships of Lucas Gar-
cia and Rios Mont waged “scorched
earth” and extermination cam-
paigns against the indigenous popu-
lation, killing well over 25,000
campesinos. We must include the
regime of General Pinochet in Chile,
whose fascist shock troops rounded
up an estimated 200,000 people after
the coup in I973 and placed them in
concentration camps. In the after-
math, an estimated 20,000 people

were killed and tortured. These are

only a few of Israel’s clients who
continue to exist only with thehelp
of Israel and our own U.S.
government.

In the words of Nataniel Lorch,
former Secretary“ General’ of the
Israeli Knesset and Israeli ambassa-
dor to Bolivia and Peru, in the win-
ter 1982 issue of the Jerusalem
Quarterly:

In fact, a considerable percentage
of Israeli defense industry exports
now go to Latin America. For
obvious reasons, little has been pub-
lished about this subject. [emphasis
added]....Latin America is basically
interested in alternative sources for
armaments in order to reduce its
dependence on one dominent sup-
plier, and Israel’s credibility as a mil-
itary power serves to engender confi-
dence in the equipment used by its

own armes forces.

The irony of this statement is that
Israel now is the main supplier of
weapons of death in Latin America.
The Israeli’Uzi and Galil riﬂes are
the mainstay in most Latin and Cen-
tral American countries, and most
of the air forces of Latin America
conduct “counter-insurgency” mis-

sions in" Israeli made Arava and ‘

West Wind aircraft. In reality, Israel
is directlyinvolved in the mass
murder of civilians on..such a large
scale in Latin America, that as a

. U.S. citizen and taxpayer, I am out-

raged my taxes go‘ to subsidize these
atrocities to the tune of $3 billion in
aid per year to Israel, and a whop-
ping $22.5 billion since 1974,

according to the General Account- ’

ing Office.

Once again, Nataniel Lorch, in

the Jerusalem Quarterly, finds a
ghastly way to describe the avarice
of Israel in maintaining these Latin
American dictators. He says, “How-
ever, on purely practical grounds, it
was found that in certain Latin
American countries the most effi-
cent[sic] [emphasis added] institu-
tion was the armed forces,
moreover, they were relatively
immune to political ‘ change, and
maintained a high degree of conti-
nuity, which is vital to the success of
any project [emphasis added].” ‘ »

I cannot remain complacent and
allow the apologists of Israel, most
notably Mr. Grayson, to distort the
truth and spread misinformation on
the pages of The Pitt News.
Moreover, I am saddened for the
peoples of Israel and the United
States, who allow our governments
to shape foreign policy in the inter-
ests of a few arms manufacturers,
whose merchants of death travel the
globe, profiting from the murder of
innocent peoples.

A Pitt Doctor Honored,
 Establishes Clinic

West German Discusses
Missile Deployment

By WES COTTER

Dr. Robert Olson, a member of
Pitt’s medical school, was honored
last Wednesday for his 10 years’ ser-
vice in Thailand working to estab-
lish a tropical disease clinic.

Olson is an associate dean for aca-
demic affairs and professor of bio-

-chemistry in the medical school. At

the ceremony held last week in
Washington, D.C., Olson received
an honorary Doctor of Medicine
degree from Chiang Mai University
of Thailand. The degree was pre-
sented at the Royal Thai Embassy
by Kasem S. Kasemsri, Thai ambas-
sador to the United States.

The ceremony was held in the
United States because two previous
ceremonies scheduled to be held in
Thailand had to be cancelled. The
first was to be held in January, but
was cancelled because the queen of
Thailand was unable to attend due
to illness, and Olson was unable to
attend a second one scheduled for
March. ‘

Olson helped establish the Ane-
mia and Malnutrition Center of Chi-
ang Mai University. The center
allowed Olson to research and inves-

V tigate protein calorie malnutrition, a ,
A disease which strikes children, and is

prevalent in Thailand.
Olson said that the center turned a

Olson went on to explain that the
specific form of malnutrition which
he was investigating kills many
children. If tli"e‘y can be treated, as in
the clinic, they usually survive and
grow. ' .

“We fed them until they got up to
their regular weight and height ratio.
They were really restored to health,”
Olson said, explaining the success of
the program that is still treating Thai

- children.

The clinic is still functioning, but
instead of American and European
doctors, it is now managed by a Thai
staff.

Olson said he was delighted to

receive the award, and took several
friends from Pitt along with his wife
asguests to the ceremony. .

Olson did much of his work in

. Thailand with help and money from

the National Institute of Health, sev-
eral members of which, were also at
the ceremony as Olson’s guests.

Olson has been a member of the A

School of Medicine for only one
year, but said that he hopes that Pitt
can “activate a link” with Thailand
as had been done by St. Louis Uni-
versity, where he had been chairman
of the biochemistry department
before coming to Pitt last year.

Winter said the American press is

American Press is getting better."

Political Rhubarb  

Pitt Awaits Outcomeot Legal Battle Between Maulers, City

By MARK A. SINDLER
And DIANE LEFKOWITZ

When football fans, let alone stu-
dents, sit in Pitt Stadium and root
for the home team, it might not be
just for the Panthers. The United
States Football League’s (USFL)
Pittsburgh entry, the Maulers, is
looking for a home, and Panther ter-
ritory just might fit the the bill.

According to George Whitmer,
chairman of the Three Rivers Sta-
dium Authority, the Maulers are
considering both Pitt and Three
Rivers Stadium but have run into
myriad legal problems with the
Northside facility:

Three Rivers‘ lease with the Steel-
ers provides that no other profes-

sional football team can play at the '

city’s stadium, but if Three Rivers is

the only facility the Maulers can use,
it will be violating anti-trust laws by "

denying the Maulers the right’ to
play there.

“It’s definitely very much on our
minds,” said Bill Keenist, public
relations director for the Maulers.

“There’s a possibility that we might
end up playing at Pitt Stadium.”

But that is as far as Keenist would
comment on the matter, which is
now in the hands of legal counsel
from both sides. I

“All I’m permitted tosay is that it
is in the hands of legal counsel,”
Keenist said of the anti-trust ramifi-
cations involved.

Pitt administrators said that they
are going to view the verbal ﬁght
from neutral box seats.

“We’ve taken pains to not be

involved,” "Pitt associate athletic

director Dean Billick said. “Our first
prerequisite to [the Maulers] is that
we not get in the middle of this polit-
ical in-fighting. ‘
“We do not want to get into politi-
cal football battles with the Rooneys
[Steeler owners], the DeBartolos or
the mayor.”

In effect, if pm Stadium is

. granted the home turf to the Maul-

ers, the mayor, Richard Caligiuri,

,must not be in opposition, Billick

said. L

1963 Team
Successful  
In Many Ways

By JIM O'BRIEN

The 1963 football team is a point
of pride to Pitt; it was a special team
in soimany ways.

The 1963 squad photo is the only
one that hangs on the wall in the Pitt
Stadium office of head coach Foge
Fazio, and that was one of the few
years since he was graduated from
the school in 1960 that he was not
associated with the football team.

“I know most of those. guys,”
Fazio offered in the way of an expla-
nation, “and that team is a standard

for_ us. That’s the kind of team we’d _

It is a team that will be honored at
Homecoming Weekend ceremonies
this Saturday, prior to the game with
Syracuse. ’

Their signatures are still on the
black walls of the University Shop, a
campus clothing store.

“They wrote their names with
chalk, and they're as clear as ever,”
store owner Jay McKenzie said “I

always felt closer to that team than
any other. You had the authentic
student athlete, and there was just a
closeness. We’ve kept in touch; they
still drop in to say hello.”

The 1963 team was an especially
exceptional team because it posted a
9-1 record and did not go to a post-
season bowl game and its members
have. been so successful in the real
world. ‘

Walt Cummins and Steve Petro,
now assistants to Edward Bozik,
Pitt’s athletic director, were line
coaches on that club, which was
directed by John M-ichelson. Cum-
mins has atphoto of the I962 team on
the wall of his office because he
could not find a photo of the I963
team. V

“It's mostly the same guys," he
said. “You remember because

i they’ve been so successful.”

Petro said, “I still_see most of the
guys. It makes you feel good to have
coached kids who’ve t-urned out so
well.”

There were 6] players on the ros-
ter that year, or about half as many
as are on most current football ros-
ters. Of that number,‘ 57 were gradu-
ated —- one of those by Youngstown
State —— and, even more impressive,
34 went on to obtain advanced
degrees. , .

A further breakdown reveals that
the I963 teamvproduced I5, dentists,
three physicians, a chiropractor, six
‘educators, five engineers, three
attorneys, four corporate execu-
tives, a banker, two National Foot-
ball League coaches, a college
football coach, two stockbrokers
and one bookmaker. The team man-
ager is a doctor. A '

The I963 team defeated UCLA,
Washington, California, West Virgi-
nia, Syracuse, Notre Dame, Army,
Miami (Fla.) and Penn State but

this in no uncertain terms,” he
added. ‘‘If the mayor says he is not
opposed to entertaining such an
idea, then we will give the matter
serious discussion.”

With 76 players and four coaches
already 'under contract with the
Maulers, this standup makes for an
equal number of delays that only
hinder a smooth start for the ﬂedg-
ling team in a similarly infant pro
league. ,

Although Keenist believes the
entire situation will be resolved
within several weeks, there has not
been one season ticket sold yet by
the Maulers.

“Sure, it puts a crimp in ‘our sea-
son ticket *sales,” Keenist said.
“There have been many inquiries on
tickets, though I can't really say how
many. .

“Personally, I have 30 orders from
family and friends, but I haven’t
even tried to fill them. But if that is
any kind of barometer, I want to
have this thing resolved soon."

that team, was something of an
exception. He came to Pitt from ,

the schedule and got knocked off at
Navy. The Midshipmen were led by
'Roger‘,Staubach in a 24-12 victory.

The final game against Penn State
was postponed because of the assas-
sination of President John F.
Kennedy. Pitt passed on some minor
bowl bids, ending up empty-handed.

The rewards have come since
then.

Four of the players enjoyed suc-
cessful pro football careers. They
were Paul Martha, Fred Hoaglin,
Marty Schottenheimer and Eric
Crabtree. Two of them are assistant
coaches in the NFL, Hoaglin with
Detroit and Schottenheimer with

I Cleveland.

Martha, an All-America running
back who always came up with the
big play at Pitt, played six seasons
with the hometown Pittsburgh
Steelers and obtained a law degree
from Duquesne along the way.

Today, he is the president of the
Pittsburgh Maulers of the United
States Football League and looks
after the sports empire of the
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. A year
ago, when he provided legal counsel
for the San Francisco ’49ers, he
received much credit for helping to
settle the NFL players’ strike.

He takes great pride in his Pitt

, accomplishments.

tors are lying low, waiting for the
legal puzzle to come, together.

“There’s a franchise in town, and
they have to have a place to play,"
said Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik,
who added that “informal discus-
sions” between Pitt and the Maulers
are taking place.

If and when the Maulers do make
Pitt Stadium their home, it will not
be the first time a pro team has used
what is now called Superturf. The
Pittsburgh Steelers used it as their
home base from 1964 to I970, while
waiting for Three Rivers’ construc-
tion to be completed. .

Bozik said there were no conﬂicts
between the Panthers and Steelers as
far as game and practice scheduling,
and, as policy required, the Steelers
paid rent to the general university
fund rather ‘ than the athletic
department. ‘

He said the Maulers and Pitt have
not yet reached the point of discuss-
ing thefinancial terms under which

the Maulers would come to Pitt;

they are waiting to see how things
turn out with Three Rivers.

 
  
 

‘‘I wish we -had won a national
championship,” Martha said. “That
loss to Navy was an accident, as I
look back upon it. We played
offense and defense in those days,
and I would have liked to have seen
how good we’d be compared to
today‘s teams if we had specialized.

“But I loved my experience at Pitt.
It preparedme for the realworld in
so many ways.”

Martha’s right-hand man at the
Civic Arena is Beano‘ Cook, who
moonlights as a college football ana-
lyst for ABC-TV on weekends.
Cook was the sports. information
director at Pitt in 1963 and pushed

, Martha for All-America.

“You knew the guys on that team
were unique the first day they came
on campus," Cook recalled.

The other All-America on that
team, Ernie
Borghetti, was drafted bylthe Kan-
sas City Chiefs but suffered a knee
injury that kept him from making
the team. He is a dentist in his home-
town of Youngstown, Ohio, and
attends all the Pitt home games.

Eastern Ohio and Eastern Penn-
sylvania were about as far as Pitt
coaches travelled in those days to
recruit players. The majority of the
‘players were home-grown. ‘

Billick, though, sees Pitt Stadium} 1

as limitedly superior to’the Three
Rivers for the Maulers. '

“It's definitely better for the spec-
tators," he said, “with many better
seats than Three Rivers. And if we
had to, we could play a night game
tomorrow night.” ' __

“I know they’re concerned about
the lighting problem [at Pitt Sta-
dium]," Whitmer said. “ls it lit well
enough for television cameras?” I‘ '

“It has been perceived to be a’
problem,” Keenist said. “If it would
ever get to that point, though, I’m
sure that could be worked out."

Billick said that Musco Corp., a A A

lighting rental ‘outﬁt, can easily
accommodate night contests on an
evening's notice.

Compared to Three Rivers, there ‘ '

are no corporate boxes at Pitt Sta-

dium — the only deficiency Billick,

noted. . ’

“How time ﬂies when you're hav-
ing fun" — this phrase does apply to
Nick Wilson, senior co-captain of
the Panther soccer team.

It seems like yesterday, Wilson
was a young freshman for Coach
Leo Bemis’ booters. Now he has just
:1 few more games as a Panther and
leader of a very young Pitt team.

“We have a very young team,”
Wilson said, “and I envy them for
that. They have the chance to grow
together as a team.”

But young players need to look to
their elders for that extra guidance
and experience. Wilson, as co-
captain and the only four-year
senior on the team, is the one to
whom they can come.

' “This year, I’ve found my role on
the team as a communicator
between the players and coach
[Bemis]; I guess because I’ve been
here the longest."

In his four years as a Panther,

. Wilson has helped his team winning

the West Penn Conference Cham-
pionship and join the Big East. He

could possibly help lead them to the
Big East Final Four Championship.

Things have changed over the
years for Wilson. This native ofCov-
entry’, England, has seen action all
over the soccer field, playing all the
positions in the midfield at one time
or another. He’s even seen himself
switched from a sophomore starter
to a reliable replacement, but no
matter what, Wilson has stuck to it.
This year, Wilson is contributing as
a starter.

“Coach was playing me at center
mid [field], but I never felt comforta-
ble at that position,” he explained.
“Center mid is more defensive, and
I’m just not a defensive minded
player.”

Now, in his final season, Wilson
has found a home on the Pitt squad
— the right midﬁeld position. There
he has contributed three goals and
four assists to the Panther scoring
attack.

“I like playing right mid,” Wilson
said. “My job is to provide a link.
between the offense and the defense.
I try to change the direction of the

play, but I still have to keep in mind
that I have to play defense.
“I like passing the ball in the mid-

field," he added. “Really, I’d much

rather pass the ball [for an assist]
than score a goal. I getjust as much
satisfaction out of that — maybe
even more."

As time runs out on Wilson’s
career as a Panther, he can look
back over the years of playing.

“Looking back, it was well worth
the time and effort,” said Wilson.
“It’s been the best experience in my
life. If there was one thing I wish I
could change, it would be that I wish
I had felt the same way in the begin-
ning of my playing career as I do
now in the end. I don’t take playing
time for granted anymore. My days

are numbered, «and I want to get the

most out of them.

He Still Gets Kick Out Of Soccer

. By MARG-ARITA ELLEN

Wilson is part of a rather new
team. They have some experienced
players - leading the ' way, but the
younger Panthers are definitely con-
tributing. With three tough matches
remaining this season, Wilson
voiced his thought on the team and
the rest of the 1983 season.

“We don’t think we have an estab-
lished leader ofthe team, as we did in
the past,” Wilson said. “No super-
star. We’re just all equals. Everyone
has ajob to do, and we do it the best
we can.

“I have a reallygood feeling about
making the Big East Final Four,”
Wilson added with enthusiasm. “We
can do it. Wejust have to go out and
beat the crap out of Villanova on
Saturday, the only Big East oppo-
nent _we play."

What ever happens to the Panther
booters in their final games, Wilson
will be in the books as a four-year
letterman at Pitt. “

“l’ve made a lot of friends and
seen some good soccer players,”
Wilson said. “What’s most impor-
tant is that Ihad the opportunity to
play soccer. I look at it as comple-

Wilson can boast about that,

with a major in philosophy. He
looks forward to attending dental
school, but what about soccer in
Wilson’s future?

“There’s always the dream in the
back of your mind ofplaying profes-
sional soccer,” said Wilson. “But
unfo_rtunately,”"that may just be a
dream. I would like to give indoor
soccer a shot, if anything. I’m better
adapted for indoor than outdoor

This weekend, it will be deter-
mined whether Tennesseeing really
is believing then Pitt women’s vol-
leyball coach Shelton Collier takes
his 23-6 spikers on the road Friday
morning for the Tennessee Classic.

Collier will discover if his young
squad believes in itself enough to
meet and defeat established teams
from the South and Southwest. In

Q order to accomplish that rather for-

’ midable task, Pitt needs to regain
the form that earned it a 19-2 record
going into the Purdue Classic three
weekends ago. »

The competition Friday and Sat-
urday will not be as inelastic as that
at Purdue, where Pitt gave two
nationally-ranked (fifth and sev-
enth) teams a scare Dracula would
have applauded.

The challenge in Tennessee will
have a more accessible goal, but it is
hardly water over the dam. That
dam,- in fact, has been well able to

_d}..hold its own — a fact ofwhich Col-

lier is well aware. i

“This is the kind of tournament
where we could go 4-0 or 0-4,” Col-
lier commented. “I am anxious to
see how we will respond to the
challenge.”

Pitt, the only team from north of
the Mason-Dixon line, will face two
teams from Texas whom it has not
seen recently. The entire state

 Texas, says Collier, is very enthusi-

astsic and supportive of its women’s
volleyball programs. The Lady Pan-
thers will meet Lamar, coached by
Katrinka Crawford, on Saturday
afternoon, and Texas on Friday
night. a ‘

‘Not seeing but still believing is
how the Lady Longhorns’ second-
year coach Lisa Love will go into
her team’s' match with Pitt. -

“We’re going into the match

as ‘pretty well blind,” Love _drawled.

it

“But, any conference champion
must be worth its salt.”

Last season, Pitt’s spikers gave
North Carolina, its second oppo-
nent this weekend, a heaping por-
tion of salt by defeating the eventual

Atlantic Coast Conference cham- .

pions in three games. The rematch
will be Saturday morning. '

The -Northerners will face their
toughest foe last. The Tennessee
Lady Volunteers are the defending
Southeast Conference winners and
are currently ranked No. 14 in the
nation.

Pitt has defeated the Lady Vols
twice in the previous two years, and
a third match played last season saw
Tennessee survive a hard-fought
battle, topping the visitors l6-l8, 15-
ll, ll-l5 and l7-l9. -

Although the Panthers have been
impressive against the Vols in the
past and are taking a four-game win-
ning streak into the match and have
dominated many opponents this
season, Pitt’s lack of seniors —
translated into‘ experience and con-
sistency — could be a critical factor
.in the tournament. -

The total picture puts Pitt on
uncertain terrain as far as predicta-

-bility of results, but Collier believes

his team can come out on topby
playing one game at a time.

“A good team consistently gets up
for every match, one at a time,” he
remarked. “An average team does
not have the discipline to take each
match one at a time.”

The spikers have spent a great
deal of time practicing defensive
strategy. Collier has gone so far as to
have members of the men’s volley-
ball club spike at his players to simu-
late the hits they will have to dig off
the court Friday and Saturday.

Collier believes time spent on the
defensive drills was well spent and
that his players have improved
dramatically. .

V The coach said, “The quesiton will
be whether we can transfer improve-
ment in practice to our actual match.’
If we continue to serve aggressively
and continue to improve our
defense, I think we’ll be in a position
to win some games.“ » _ .

An interesting development in the

tournament's teams is the presence
of several area players facing each
other across the net, spikers who
graduated from nearby high schools

but decided to _play ball out of state. I

nation. Ed Beachler later worked as
a sports writer with The Pittsburgh
Press.

The two other doctors from that
squad are John H. Zabkar from
Latrobe —- a pathologist at Alle-
gheny General Hospital, the same
place where former Pitt All-America
basketball player Don Hennon is a
staff surgeon — and John Verk-
leeren, who came out of Charleroi,
Pa., and is now a doctor in
California.

He is not the only one to go to
California to seek his fortune.

Fred Mazurek was ajunior quar-
terback on that 1963 team. He mar-
ried the coach’s daughter, Sue

Michelson, which pointed up his
moxie as much as anything he did on

1. Don't laugh with or at your friend when

the football field. Mazurek, who
grew up in Republic, Pa., is acorpo-
rate lawyer in California. He and
Sue have a 17-year-old son who is a
quarterback prospect now favoring
Stanford among the many schools
meeting his skills.

The fullback on that club was
Rick Leeson. His father, Al, had
been a lineman for the “Dream
Backfield” teams Sutherland turned
out in the ’30s. Young Leeson came
to Pitt from nearby Chartiers Valley
High School in Scott Township. He
is a dentist in Monroeville and active
in alumni affairs.

The other member of that back-
field, Bill Bodle, came to Pitt from
Deerfield High School in suburban
Chicago. His coach there was

Pitt’s “Dream Backfield,” who
recommended him to Michelson, his
former teammate. _

“I enjoyed the football and the
school itself,” Dr. Leeson said. “The
school couldn't have done more for

us. They offered me a chance to con-
tinue my education. I paid for my
dental school studies, but the loyalty
of the school was unsurpassed.

“I know boys who got scholar-
ships and didn’t playva minute and
came back for a fifth year and they
were still on a free ride. When the
school is loyal to you like that...y_ou
feel good about it.”

(Editor's Note: Jim 0’Brien, cur-
rently in his ﬁrst year as Pitt assis-
tant athletic director and sports
information director, was sports edi-
tor of The Pitt News in the early ’60s,

when he reported on the 1963 team.) _

Warford Valor. . ..

Kentucky governor John Y.
Brown Jr. will today present the
state medal of valor to Pitt assistant
basketball coach Reggie Warford.

Warford, who played his college
ball at Kentucky, saved the lives of
two elderly Lexington, Ky., resi-
dents last month when he pulled
them from a burning building.

Hole Appears..._.

Minnesota -football coach Joe
Salem has resigned, effective at the
end of the season. ‘

Salem had an I8-31-l record with
the Gophers in the past five seasons
and a career record of >98-86-3.

Salem does not have any ‘definite
plans for the future, although he did
admit he was a candidate for the
position of athletic director of
Northern Arizona.

This season, after defeating Rice
in Minnesota’s opening game, the
Gophers lost six straight games,
including five Big 10 contests. The
Gophers meet Michigan State Sat-
urday before closing out the season
against Illinois, Michigan and Iowa.

Before returning to his alma
mater in 1979, Salem spent nine sea-
sons as head coach at South Dakota
with a 52-38-2 record and four more
at Northern Arizona with a 26-17
record.

Steeler. Draftee
Paralyzed... .

Doctors said yesterday that
Gabriel Rivera, the Steelers’ No. 1
draft choice this year, is paralyzed
from the chest down and probably
will never walk again.

Rivera suffered severe spinal
injuries last Thursday in an automo-
bile accident in the North Hills.

Dr. Dan Diamond, who has
supervised Rivera's care since the
accident, said Rivera will have
another operation in the next few
days in the attempt to stabilize his
spine. However, Diamond said the
surgery will have no effect on the
22-year old lineman‘s paralysis.

you’re ready.

 

You’re maneuvering
445 feet of guided
missile frigate through
the navigational
hazards and non-stop
traffic of one of the
world’s busiest ports.
But you’ll dock
safely. Because you
know your equipment.
You know your men. And even when the
responsibility weighs in at 3,600 tons...

i After four years of college, you’re
ready for more responsibility than most
civilian jobs offer. Navy officers’ get the
kind of job and responsibility they want,
and they get it sooner. -

L Navy officers are part of the manage-
ment team after 16 weeks. Instead of boot
camp, officer candidates
receive four months’
of leadership training.
It.’s professional school-
ing designed to sharpen
their technical and
management skills.
Then, in their first
assignment, Navy
officers get manage-

D I’d rather have responsibility, sooner. Tell me

merit experience that
could take years in
private industry. And
they earn the decision-
making authority it
takes to make that
responsibility pay off.
As their manage-
, merit abilities grow,
Navy officers.can take 4
advantage of advanced education and
training in fields as varied as operations
management, electronics, and systems
analysis. In graduate’ school it would cost
you thousands; in the Navy We pay you.
And the Navy pays well. The start-
ing salary is $17,000 (more than most
companies pay). And that’s on top of a
comprehensive benefits program that
can include special duty pay. After four
years, with regular
