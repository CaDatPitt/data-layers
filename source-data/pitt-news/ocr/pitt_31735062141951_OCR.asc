It is ‘planned to have the reunion

‘As has been the. custom in the past,
this will be a very formal bangiieit,
and it is open -to a»1uni“ni,",students,
faculty and friends ofthe University,
although the alumni features will, of
course, predominate.
rule has been that all Seniors who
attend become automatic-all_v m-embers

j_ of the. Alumni‘ Association for one
,.ye_a.r, and are, therefore, permitterl to

get a football‘ ticket inthe preferred
class. The same plan will be adopted:
this, year. The lsleniors who attend
will be ’consid‘e:red Alumni.~.Givers un-

“Bull” RUSSELL,‘ EX’ll  
  WRITES at KEY, WEST

R- w.‘ ,(“Bob"") Russell, Med. ‘=11-,
-well known S‘. A.’ E., has been in Key
West, Florida, since the latter part
of January on his doctor's. instruc-
tions.‘ He writes from the Clasai Ma.‘-
‘rina Hot‘eI,_advising that he had two
‘att‘a,cks_ oflgrippe before 'Cl1ristm*a{s,
and that hewent South‘ to regain his
health. Since arriving therehe has
gained 15 pounds, and is feeling tip
top. Bob has developed into quite a
ﬁsherman around Florida, and sends
a lengthyjfaccount of how he and an-
other man were responsible for bring-
ing in the first tarpon or silver king
of the season, therefore settling the
«contestwaged every season between
the Florida east and west coast win-
ter resorts. As‘ Bob has always been
a. very truthful fellow we‘ do not doubt
his statement as to the size and ﬁght-
ing ‘ability of thefamous leaping tar-
pon Atlanticus. He‘-claims that said
tarponweighed 115. pounds and was
over six feet long. Incidentally, he
got another one weigh_ing’46 pounds.
We are giving this information to
_“Pitt Weekly” readers for__what it
maybe worth, as we have no. way ‘of,
verifying the story‘. »

Here are some of Bob’s comments
‘regarding Key West: . ‘ ‘

This town has 18,000 population
and is very interesting. All the best
Havana cigars can be bought in = any
‘store. at a cheapprice. ,'1_‘here has
never been a frost here, and the cold-
est day in two years-was 56. Fishing,
sponging, shipping and “cigar making
are the principal industries. Onepof
the -m‘ost‘~ interesting sights here is
the Flagler‘ Florida East Coa.st-‘Over-
seas Railroad,‘ called the eighth won-
der ofthe world. From-the mainland
to Key‘WeSt, built on submerged cor-
'al reefs and made roadbed, all con-
structed under water. The trains speed-
ing seemiugly on..the very‘ top of the
‘beautifully colored waters made a pic-'
ture not soon -forgotten. Tourists here
this season who have ‘traveled exten-
sively say ' there? is .- no ‘place :in ‘the
world where the climate equals. that
of. Key West. _ . . . .

number hadbeen expected, this crowd
far exceeded all hopes, and resulted in

the checking facilities. ‘The. garden
was decorated with a thousand blue

rope ‘from the massive

shadows among the balloons and
hangings,,resulting in a most beauti-
ful effect. ' Suddenly, they were
dropped, and while the band played

_Now as to anotheriblofnde therefis
«Joseph Trombone Stone, famous for
hishability to carry 18 economy‘ hours
-‘along’ with 1169 point scale . credits,
-a girl in isxouthx Empire, Ohio, a mus-

V tache}: thpatvused‘ to be (his girl object-

ed, so he eradicated. it), and "a dink

those are his girl's‘ initials; wonder
what her, lastname is). Joe is grad-
uating in June, or at least he will if
hisprofs keep on encouraging him,
and he expects to go home‘ and clean
up the po1it'ics,'of the village imme-
diately after arrival. We busy-news

ranged fcr a big public celebration
when’ the So. Empire—,Limi’t_ed brings
‘Joe in. ,Of course, we’re .proudg_ of

Ha‘v'e_we ever told” you about Marty

0 jorie Withers, the girl who hafdher

not. _Marty is the r'ed-headed girl (she
claims it is auburn.) who can "be found

Mellott; Charles Heriry Fleming, Ed-

run the ,candy desk, in the _basement
of State Hall, but sh_e ceased and de-
sisted =upon .ﬁndii'1g that it i'sgimpos’-
sible to sell candy to students of- econ-
Fomy. ' ‘When .-asked what “Withers
meant, she said it was the;'back?of a

we think of horses. ~ Stra‘nge,’isn’t it,‘
that horses are on our .mind so much?

the girl co-eds said about Jack .Sack’s

THE NORTHWESTERN DSCEATHS»

 

*' We-are interested" in the. student

-deaths, at Northwestern, realizingi

that they , are the result of what must
be knownto theworld at large as “un-
ldergraduate, activities.” .
have, had university experiencej know
that hazing does not come within that
category, in the true sense. But the
underg'radu‘ate will - suffer from this
incident. Indeed he has suffered.a1-
ready at Northwestern; -social ‘affairs-
of. the Freshman and Sophomore

classes _have been prohibited by the -

fac'_ulty._ '  «

-fwhy the prohibition? we can of- ’

fer but one answer: The administra-

tive oﬂicers must make the public see '

-that they? realize.‘ the seriousness of
the situation by taking’ drastic_ action

of some sort. The'~ blow which they

choose to deliver falls-gsepqually hard
upon the heads of the innocentiand
-the guilty, having, to be sure, no no-
table I ‘affect. I The,‘ students: will ; not
suffer greatly . from‘ ~=thejir deprivation;

V‘ ‘ the menwho ..are. responsible for the

childish barbarism are. sufficiently
mortiﬁed ‘by’ the resultsof their dem-
onstrations to forego similar action

E Even so, the university authorities
are throwing the burden of blame up-
