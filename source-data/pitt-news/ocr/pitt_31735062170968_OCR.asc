BAS Office Threatened    

by Obscene Phone Calls

by_JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN
News Editor

The Black Action Society office
received several obscene tele-
phone calls Monday morning from
male students identifying them-
selves as members of Pitt frater-
nities. The callers threatened BAS
that their Tallocations request
would be.in danger because the
Greeks control Student Govern-
ment and the Student Union."

Joey Fuller. deputy chairman
of BAS tell the calls ' came truin
a couple of individuals with warp-
ed minds who.are mad at us for
scheduling events" during Greek
Week." ‘

Fuller explained, that though to
her knowledge the Intrafraternity
Council did not have events
scheduled in the space BAS used
Monday morning, her organiza-
tion would have been “willing” to
give up the space had they been
asked.

What concerned Fuller more.
however. is that the "calls may
have represented direct threats

’ from Student Government ——’ and

we wouldn't want our allocations
to be in danger over a silly thing
like programming events during
Greek Week."

Jay Latterman. Interfraterni-A

ty Council president. maint'ained
that he "would seriously doubt
that the caller could be a member
of any fraternity-—the speech by
Abena Seiwaa in no way effected
any of the programming during
Greek Week." - "
Commenting on the threat that
since the Allocations Committee
is controlled by fraternity mem-

bers that the'BAS allocation will
be affected, Latterman stated;
“This is totally false. Though
members of Student Government
and the Allocations are Greeks,
wedo in no way run those organ-
izations.”

Fuller said. "The thing that up-
sets us most is the audacity of
these people to threaten our allo-
cations request and the audacity
to say that they control Student
Governinent.”

Fuller went on to stress that "if

-our allocations request is tamp-

ered with in any way. by any
form of ignorant racism. we will
take whatever steps are neces-
sary to see that justice is done."

PPU.has begun necessary action

Professors Want Union Recogniiioniili

by MONICA CIROCCO

The Pitt Professional Union
(PPU) a group of University fac-
ulty members headed by Profes-
sor Van Beck Hall of the History
Department. decided to take the
necessary action t'or union recog-
nition March 15. '

Following Public Law 195.
which recognizes public em-
ployees' right to unionize. the

group must obtain 30 percentAfac—

ulty membership. The American

Federation of Teachers (AFT) is

helping the PPU with the neces-

sary procedures. '

The PPU stands in contrast to

the American Association of Uni-,
versity Professors (AAUP),

dents will be charged a fee for all add-.drop transac-

tions after the initial one. The chargewill be $5 per
transaction andwill be.paiAd at the time the add-
drop is made. said Register Frank Reed. '

After the fall term. the effects of the fee will be
reviewed and a_ decision will be madw by the Pro-
vost's office’ and the Operations Office whether

.\to maintain the new system or find a different way

to solve the add-drop problems.

These problems, explained Reed, are the abuse
of the add-drop system by a small percentage of
the‘ students and the increasing costs of processing

Denenberg Warns of A

insurance Policy Sales

Insurance Commissioner Herbert S. Denenberg cautioned Penn-
sylvania college students against purchasing a life insurance policy
which results in the creation of an immediate and irrevocable debt

obligation.

Denenberg explained that this sales agreement. in which the first
years premiums are deferred and a legally enforceable promissory

~ note. or loan. issued. can result in an unwanted expense as high as $400

by immediately eliminating the possibility for reconsideration and

cancellation of the policy. -

Denenberg issed the warning in a letter sent to the presidents of
150 colleges, universities, and junior colleges throughout the Com-
monwealth. The letter was sent after the Insurance Department re-
ceived complaints from students and parents about the selling tech-

nique.

In most other insurance agreements. Denenberg explained. the
policy may be cancelled without further obligation by the policyholder
through non-payment of premiums.iHowever. under the loan arrange-
ment. the debt for the first year premiums continues regardless ot' the
payment of premiums or desire to cancel the policy.

In the event the student does not continue to pay the premiums for
five years. the loan becomes due immediately.

“This type of life insurance purchase may be sound for some col-
lege students, permitting them to’ receive immediate coverage and de-
ferring the payment until they are out of school,” Denenberg corn-

ented.

Under this type of sales agreement. Denenberg explained. the t'irst-
year‘s premium is paid through a promissory note. as an inducement

“The convention was really im-
portant for energizing the Wom-

“Women law students do feel iso-
lated from the rest of the legal
profession, and being altogether
at the convention did give them a
feeling of unity.”

vided into several sessions of
workshops. “Many of the.work-
shops were unfortunately geared
specifically to the problems of
women law students." comment-
ed White.

’ "Originally the convention dealt
solely in this area. Now. however.
they are interested in branching
out and getting more people in-
volved."

“Those workshops which steer-

ed away from the specifics of the ,

woman law student were excel-
lent,” White added.

Kennedy urged avoidance of the

Now. he explained. there is theljg 
possibility that there will be noj"

“The AAUP is a group concei‘_n-7.
ed with academic freedom and is

said. "Pitt has a strong FAS.and, :A..3
Senate. and most of AAUP actionf r 5
is taken through these bodies. A

He cited a possible block-the .,
PPU may encounter in its efforts-'
to unionize: the PPU,has the ‘lee-_
way to define who the ‘Affacu_lty”’~_
will include, but the administra-~
tion can dispute the definition.
This would send the issue through
a long and complex set of proce-
dures.  

To support this Marshall noted
that Johonstown faculty mem-ff
bers took the same action as the"
PPU. with the aid of the Nationalf
Education -Association ([NEA.)..
Pitt disputed that the Jolinstovvn.-A.
faculty are separate from the to-'
tal Pitt faculty. The issue became.-
a matter of "over-fractionaliza‘-A..

been well over a year since the

4000 FIFTH AVE.

by CIIARGLES w. OGG

Monday's Black Action Society lecture highlighted the feelings
of many Black hIstor_\ students within both the L'IIi\'eI‘sIt_\ and the so-
ciety. Dramatist, lecturer, and producer Abena Seiwaa‘ (formerly Joan
Phillips Brown) spoke about the roles of the Black woman within
American Society. She contrasted them to a new ideal created partial-
ly with the use of the Black African cultural heritage.

Seiwaa has traveled to Africa regularly, and spends a good deal
of time raising funds so that she may "increase the flow of both infor-
mation and Blacks between Africa and the United States."

She has also been involved as actress and producer in numerous
dramatic productions. _

Readings written by Black women through American history oc-
cupied a good deal of her talk. The first piece was a tale of an old Black
couple and their grandchild as they were mercilessly tortured directly
after the Reconstruction period. *

Seiwaa, totallyimmersed in the feeling. expressed a tale of mur-
der. She used her facial expressions and body to describe a woman
watching “her man being shot in the head and burned, while her grand-
son was in tears.” It soom became apparent that this was the result
of one man’s radicalism.

Sexuality played an important part within her speech. Seiwan
saidsexuality must be used to “bind the Black brother and sister to-
gether, instead of tearing them apart as the white man has striven to
do throughout history.” ‘

She specifically called it a "war between the races.“ one of the
main defenses being the “-Black man’s emphasis on virility."

She later explained that this does not imply the Black woman

A should become "subdominate. A real Black man does not want a para-

site."

Seiwaa developed her characterization of what she considers the

ideal Black woman, by referring to well-known singers. First she
criticized Diana Ross’ portrayal of Lady Sings the Blues.

She claimed, "The movie is about Motown, creating models of in-
tegration which we are supposed to emulate.”

Of Lady Day. she said, “Her voice became the essence of our exis-
tence. She turned it into music and made some of us sad. some of us
happy, but left no one untouched by emotion.”

Seiwaa consistently referred to whites as Europeans attempting
to force the students to think of their physical heritage before cul-
tural upbringing. _

She drew bitter caricature of the white woman, contrasted with

her vision of the Black woman as "passionate. feeling, and able to do '

_almost anything better.”

“We must build a Black nation. a Black Strength. which attacks the
ways and lies within the system.”

At that time. the original amount

with accumulated interest. comes

ly finance one or more of the

subsequent premiums in the same»

fashion.

Denenberg cautioned students
against signing more than one
promissory note at a time, noting
that Insurance Department
guidelines require the company to
contact each policyholder regard-
ing how he wants to pay his sub-
sequent premiums. '

Professors Want Union

-(Continued from Page 1)

When asked why the PPU didn't
wait until the Johnstown case was
decided. he replied; "The theory
seems to be ‘strike while the iron

is hot,"' in light of the fact that .

interest is higher because of the
present budget status.

"The phrase going around is
"are they passing out the cards
yet?” he added. He noted that
signing a PPU membership card
is, in a sense, voting for a gener-
al election between the two ‘rep-
resentative groups.

Marshall discussed AAUP plans
saying that the AAUP could either
solicit 30 percent membership
itself, or let the PPU go. through
its own procedures, with the
AAUP coming into the picture at

election time.

He noted that the danger in the
latter action is the possibility that
faculty members, seeing that the
PPU did all the work, would prob-
ably vote for it, even if their past
allegiance was with the AAUP,
therefore, he feels the AAUP will
probably choose the former ac-
tion, if necessary. '

Marshall concluded that he is in
favor of union benefits, but is
against the negative aspects
which accompany unionization.
‘Therefore. I would join the union’
because I would want a voice in
matters."

Dr. David Powers, Assistant to
the Chancellor for Academic Af-
fairs. felt that it was premature
to comment upon the PPU's ac-
tion.

Hays Discusses “New Urban History"

by DREW PORVAZNIK
Dr. Samuel Hays. History De-
partment chairman. spoke on

"New Urban History" Thursday.

Hays discussed new types ()1 ur-
ban research in which certain as-
pects in cities’ histories are ana-
lyzed to explain long run social
changes.

According to Hays, three ways,
are used to analyze city develop-
ment. The ‘first is the concept
method which deduces generaliz-

ations about behavior in cities.

The second is the comparative
method.‘ Historians compare how
one thing is similar to phenomen-
on in other cities. An example
would be comparing Irish migra-
tion in the 1800s from hetero-
generous cities to homogeneous
cities. “

The third method collects data’

and analyzes to explain various
urban phenomenon.

“New Urban History” uses these
methods in reconstructing social
patterns from the 19th and 20th
centuries in order to deal with ur-
ban phenomenon. This new history
is concerned where things fitinto

society, such as who is involved in .

political action, migration, riot-
ing, etc.

Hays discussed a study in so-
cial mobility in cities. Data from
censuses _in the 1800s from New
Britain. Conn.. was used to dis-
cover the social mobility pattern.

The result was that New Bri-
tain had a stable population and
limited amount of social mobility.
Hays warned that the pattern of
limited social mobility might not
hold true for rapidly growing
cities.

Hays spoke of another study of
migration where the Irish popula-

[tion of London was examined.
Data gathered from pension rec-
ords showed that the Irish of Lon-
don were very mobile. The social
structures also remained un-
changed. '

A 20th century study of Erie's
population in relation to ethnicity
and politics was discussed. The
findings revealed ethnics and re-
ligion were powerful determin-
ants of party registration. _

The study further showed that
in Erie "at least one-third of a

particular ethnic group had to be -

middle class in order to be influ-
ential on the city council." ’

Another survey discussed ex-
amined the patterns of life of the
iron and steel leaders. This study
disclosed that Andrew Carnegie

    
       
     
         

  

was an “odd ball” in relation to the
lives of the other steel leaders.
He worked his way up the ranks
which was unusual. Other leaders
came from well-to-do families.

In addition. the Carnegie group
lived on Penn Ave. while other
steel leader groups lived on the
l\'orthside. Carnegies steel plants

, reconstructing

also had larger numbers of Scotch
people employed than other steel
companies.

Hays stated that the "New Ur-
ban History" attempts broad
comparisons of similarities and
dissimilarities in cities through
social patterns.
The new research shows that ci-

ties have their own peculiar char-
acteristics.

New urban history “finds out
in a system what is general or.
particular about cities." The re-
search examines urban changes
such as mobility in and out of ur-
ban areas and how it is related in
other areas.

  EDITORIAL

 Tliougli we are an egocentric bunch—too proud of our rag to con-
”,-cede its faults, the time is upon us, as a new editorial board, to come
forth and explain to what end we publish a paper three times a week.

,‘ The Pitt News, as a student newspaper acknowledges an obli-
gat'i‘on to serve as much of the student body as is willing to be
(served. By service we mean the presentation of the information.
. ideas. fears, ambitions-‘and horrors of the university community; and
I ‘the influences of the operative forces which impinge upon that €ll\’ll‘()ll-
fment by the larger surrounding community.

Attorney Thomas Livingston, a

ampaign actively for republican

area. His role is not dissimilar
from the ,one played by his

significant candidate.

To win the democratic nomi-
nation this _time, Flaherty will
have to beat Richard S. Caliguiri,

a vocal" and popular councilman.

Both men are young.‘Both men
are popular. Both have histories
of political independence. The
fundamental difference lies in
the philosophies that each of

these candidates have concern-.

ing city government. Flaherty
sees the city government as “a
unit of government which man-
agesrtax dollars.” Caliguiri sees
the city as being responsible for
“progressive change” and pro-
vision of “human and social pro-
grams”. This choice will be pre-
sented to the Democratic con-
stituants this May.

Former Mayor Joseph M. Barr
has said that “the democratic
primary is the election in the
city of Pittsburgh.“ In’ the re-
cent past this has proven to be
true. assuming this, only the
Caliguiri-Flaherty matchup on

‘the Democratic ballot will be

important. But who will win that
one is anybody's guess at this
point and whatwill happen next
is probably as unpredictable as
the recent maneuvering. .

By GEORGE ZRUST

Believe it or not. there are
questions that baffle even great
minds such as my own. The trou-
ble is. the one question I find
hardest to answer is the one I
hear most: "How ya‘ doin“?"

People who have a better com-
mand of the English language
may stretch it out to "How are
you doing?". but the question is
identical no matter how you ask
it. Even in foreign languages the
query "takes on a remarkable
sameness after a while.

Usually the question is the

first thing that issues from the"

mouth of an acquaintance upon
meeting him or her, unless the
person is a smoker. In that case
it’s a blue cloud or a cough, and
then only the “How are you?”

Through some rather unscien-
tific research of my own. I‘ve
discovered that the question is
most often asked of me by peo-
ple who don‘t know me very
well.

What I haven’t
yet is why they ask it.

figured out

The conclusion you are tempt-
ed to come to is that its a rath-
friendly way to
strike up a conversation. With
a friend. this may be true. An
inquiry about my condition leads
not only to a direct response.
but also usually to something
bigger and better: a loud and
lively dialogue. some mildly in-
teresting anecdotes. or even a
dirty joke or two.

This is. however. not the way
it turns out with "sort of" fri_ends

or semi—strangers. especially if
I don‘t know what their taste is
in jokes. A "How ya‘ doin“."‘
becomes torturing.

The usual response is to look
at the quizzer dumbfoundedly,
with pleading eyes that say,
“Why do you ask me such a
stupid thing?” Actually, you are

thinking something to the effect

of, “I was doing very well, until
you came along!”

So you grind your shoes on

the ground a little bit. stare down
for a while. and generally him-
haw around. Then. after much
mental strain. you burp out your
intelligent answer: "Aw. really
okay!" And you nod your head
for emphasis. asking the other
person the silly question he
just laid at your doorstep.
, If you are lucky. he or she
will begin to drift away. ex-
plaining that a very important
class happens to be starting right
at that moment. However. luck
in such instances _is- frequently
in ‘short supply. and a depthless
conversation drags on. permeat-
ed by long. mind-wracking stret-
ches of silence.

All. because of the innocent-
sounding "How are you doing‘?‘’

It is- difficult to do anything

‘about the situation, especiallyiif

you lead a life as dull as mine.
You end‘up lying anytime you
say something that isn’t bland
and ordinary. Yet, the creative
individual can find great chal-
lenge in making up answers.
Replies like "Barely hanging
on" and "Just eking out an ex-

istence“ -are favorites of mine._

sayNothing At All

Quite often they invite dumb
"Why's that?" questions that
are really tough to follow up.
Or start out with "I feel strictly
stinko!“ and tell some whopper.
lie about your dangerous under-
water treasure hunt in Chartiers
Creek.

Another way to find answers
to "How are you?" questions is
to beg fate to be extremely kind
or nasty. or both. to you. This
is asomewhat uncertain method.
but it may letyou win the Penn-
sylvania lottery and get hit by a
speeding freight train in the
same week. That‘s a combina-

tion sure to fuel a conversation.

If you neither trust fate or
your own-imagination. there's
one last thing to do: take mat-
ters into your own hands. Do

something novel that will give

you material for dialogue.
For instance, take two shotgun

'' shells, dump out the buckshot

and replace it with carpet tacks.
Naturally, you load the “tack-
shot” shells into a double-bar-
reled shotgun. Now the tricky
part: _

Carefully placing a finger ac-
ross both triggers. attempt to
scratch your back with the load-
ed shotgun. If you come through
alive. you’ll have more than
enough to talk about. If you don't
make it. at least other people
will have plenty to say.

Now you know how to reply
when people ask you. "How
ya‘ doin’?‘' ’ 1

Basically, you talk, and say
nothing at all. ‘

A one-two punch that looms in
the form of inadequately funded
state aid programs and massive
cutbacks on the federal level
could send thousands of young
Pennsylvanians reeling for lack
of sufficient student aid for their
postsecondary schooling next fall.

That message, was presented to
the House Appropriations Com-
mittee by Kenneth R. Heeher. exe-
cutive director of the Pennsyl-
vania Higher Education Assis-
tance Agency. when he delivered

the student aid requirements fac- i

ing the Commonwealth in the bud-
get request for PHEAA for fiscal
1973-74. He told the committee
that without effective state and
federal student financial aid pro-
grams. chances are that a great
many students will not be able to
get a postsecondary education
next Fall.

Reeher questioned the absence

of the Agency’s request for fund- _

ing of- disadvantaged student
scholarships (Act 101) and con-
tinuing aid for flood victim stu-

A dents whose plight, he said, will

continue «unabated in 1973-74 in
many instances. The Agency is
asking that Governor Shapp set
aside special funds for flood vic-
tims again next fall as he did in

_ the emergency last August.

The Governor's budget recom-
inendation included $1.4 million to
fund the new Veterans’ State
Scholarship Program for the next
academic year at the same level
as the current school year. while
PHEAA is requesting $5 million.
a cut of $2 million.

The new State Scholarship Pro-
gram for veterans. enacted by the
General Assembly last year. he
said. makes it easier for a veter-

an to obtain state scholarship

eran. flood and disadvantaged
student programs are inadequate
and would'have to be made up
from the basic state scholarship
funding. the result would be "re-
vision of eligibility standards of
major proportions." Reeher said.
He called this possibility “most
unpopular.

the problem, either. Many times,

students will turn to the guaran-

this is a part of the state’s philo-
sophy which requires that a stu-
dent is expected to make a sub-
stantial contribution to the pay-
ment of his costs by working and
by loans. It’s called a “two-thirds

grant groups who came to Pitts-
burgh in large numbers in the
late 1800's. In planning the Ca-
thedral of Learning in the 1920's.
it was decided to have these
groups share in the construction
of the building by contributing
rooms symbolizing their heritage.
which would surround the Com-
mons Room on the (.'athedral’s
lirst floor.

The war years complicated the
monumental task of coordinating
the designs. plans. and imported
building materials. the foreign
architects. and native ci'al'tsmen
and artists who came to Pitts-
burgh to decorate the rooms.

According to Bruhns, every de-
tail for each room was carefully
designed and executed, even the
door handles, .hinges, and waste
baskets. ‘

Plans for the construction of
the rooms were created and car-
ried out by the late John Gabbert

Bowman. then chancellor of the

University. and Ruth Crawford
Mitchell. now director emeritus

.of the Nationality ~Rooms Pro-

gram.
Mitchell was awarded the Chan-
cellor‘s Medal by Chancellor Pos-

var last May for her outstanding
work tor the .\ationality' {ooiiis
Program. while Bruhns was nam-
ed as her successor at that time.

It was Bruhn’s idea to have a
Visitors’ Center and a Gift Cen-
ter. She said; “I realized that a
visitor’s first impression of the
University is often formed upon
entering the Cathedral. I felt that
every effort should be made to
insure that this experience is a
positive one.”

The Gilt Center. located in the
information area of the Cathe-
dral of Learning. features import-
ed handicrafts from nations rep-
resented by .\'ationality Rooms
and others.

According to Jo Ann Sircely,
Gift Center co-ordinator, most of
the gifts are handmade and are
moderately priced.

Some of the many items avail-
able include Zodiac rings trom
Italy. camel bells from India.
chopsticks from Japan. marble
eggs. an assortment of‘ jewelry.
and burro muzzles from Mexico.
and hanging baskets from the
People's Republic of Cliii_ia. which
can be used for plants.

Luckey beans from India are

among the new shipment of items: _

reveal 10 tiny ivory chip animals.
Belief has it that the strength of
animals will be acquired when
\holding the beans.

Barry Klassel picked The Im-
portance of Being Earnest for his
outing as a director in the Studio
simply because it gave him a
good gut reaction. He poined out.
that in addition to re-
niaiiiing a very funny piece of
theatiicalism. Earnest says a lot
about accepting peoples‘ social
masks as valid defenses and .a
real expiession of self.

From this point of view, he
finds the play required work on
three levels, a psychological un-
derstanding of the characters,
getting into mannerisms, carri-
age, and style of high-class human

behavior in the nineties, and the '

rhythm and timing of the comedy.

Tennessee Williams Play

Not Well I ntegratecl

by PRESTON RIDGE
This year marks the 25th an-
iiiversary of Tennesse \\'illiams'
Pulitzer Prize wiiining play A
Streetcar Named Desire.

One of his finest works. the play

A is a tragic testament to the des-

truction of Blanche DiiBois. a one
time southern belle. who has
found that time and a world o1it—
side the plantation are too much
for her.

The production of this work
which opened at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse Thursday, man'ages to
capture only a mechanical hint
at the greatness of the play.

Anna Strasberg is wrong for
the role of Blanche. Blanche is a
delicate.‘ decaying. woman living
in. a dream world of the distant
past.

Strasbergs pei'for1nance has
none of the delicacy. and none of
the inner hurt which the often-
wounded Blanche must accept as
part of her life. Many of her
scenes cannot be heard beyond the
third row because she speaks in

‘such a low register. We are not

ready for Blanche's final fall as
we have not been prepared with
fialf the necessary depth of her
character.

Norman Ornellas as Stanley
Kowalski, ‘the role which shot
Marlon Brando to fame, fares lit-
tle better than Strasberg. While

v the ladies in the play have neatly

coifed period hairstyles he sports
a 197-'3 shag which is amazingly in-
appropriate.» 1

‘ His performance is on so many

different levels that one ifs left
with the feeling that even lie was
not sure of exactly what he was
doing. The result is coitfusioii.
I<‘lo1'e1ice Lacy as Stella Ko\\‘;lI-
ski turns in a credible perlo1‘11t—
ance. However. it is Earl Boen. as
Stanley‘s friend Mitch. who walks
away with the acting honors.
Mitch's love for Blanche and
his dismissal of her because of
her tainted background is por-

trayed by Boen with a great deal" '
of believability and conviction. I

His is the only complete char-
acter in the production. -

The-set and costiiiites are quite-

effective., although on opening
night there were some embar-
rasiiigly long scene breaks during
which I suspect costume changes
were being made; These breaks
should be shortened.

Director Maira I.ey-Piscator
has given us a production which
does. not work as a whole. It is
well mounte_d. but there are just
too many separatepieces which
never seem to blend.

iDocumentary Offers A

us that the word also means a
refuge. a shelter. a place of se-
curity—this is the kind of as_yluni
the documentary of the same
name is about.

Directed by Peter Robinson.
Asylum is the result of six weeks

of filming in Laing’s experimen- .-

tal,therapeutic community in
London for the mentally disturb-
ed. The experience that is related
jars the viewer into questioning
not only the traditional ways of
dealing with the "insane.“ but the
whole accepted realm of inter-
personal relationships.

After an introduction by Laing,
we are inside the series of build-
ings which house the community.
The camera is an observer, re-
cording the behavior of the peo-
ple—both “patients” and “doc-

t0rs”—-in the house. It is difficult"

to tell which is which.

Everyone wears regular. coin-
fortable clothing. mostly .jeans
and loose-fitting shirts: We see
sentences of what is apparently
nonsense language scribbled on
the walls; we cut in on meals and
people in the kitchen eating
snacks: we get close-ups of some
of "the frequent. informal group
discussions.

moved from the community by his
father.

As the film continues. the se-
quences become longer and deal
almost entirely with the ways in
which the members of the coin-
munity relate and interact. There
never seems to be more than one
psychiatrist or doctor present in
the house—Laing himself only ap-
pears once. briefly—and the doc-
tor's role is never emphasized.

It is not difficult to become in-
volved as a viewer. There are real
bonds and real feelings in this
asylum. As we become accustom-
ed to the atmosphere of_ the

house. we see that the people
there are not so different at all.
They have only been unable to deal
with the world as it is_ outside. and
among people who take time to
listen to them. who do not define
them as "strange." they function

‘with few problems. The emphasis

in the community is on honesty
and understanding — something
which seems to be noticeably ab-
sent "out there."

Thedifference between the
world “out there” and the world
inside the community is pointed
up very effectively when Jamie’s
father comes totake him home.

liernative Mental Care

From a previous conversation

Jamie has with two fellow mem- '

bers, we know that he wants to
stay. His father arrives: an in-
transigent man who will talk only
about money. On his way out, he
tells two members that he has
found Jamie a girl friend because
he doesn’t want him to go “the

other way.” ‘We begin to wonder
. just who is crazy.

Through the realistic manner in
which the film.is done. we get a
clear idea of what R. D. Laing is
doing. and yet things do not ap-
pear to have been structured to
fit a formula. Robinsons film is
an honest documentary.

Speaking from his of'fice in the
Pitt Field House lastThursday
afternoon. University of Pitts-
burgh Athletic Director Casimir,
Myslinski would not definately
say that head basketball coach
Charles “Buzz" Ridl will be back
in his capacity next season. How-
ever. the insinuation was strong
that Ridl will return.

"*I haven't had time to talk to
Ridl and have not discussed any-
thing with him yet." Myslinski
said. "Even. though I have been
thinking basketball all season
long. I‘ve had football on my
mind also.

"Soon, I will talk with him—

and ask him to give me an evalu-
ation of this year as well as what
he plans on doing next year.
‘That‘s normal procedure around
here. And. personally I don't
know if there is really anything
to talk about."

In his office further down‘ the
hall, Ridl went about his work
with confidence. Talking on the
phone about a recruit, Ridl -was
then thinking of having the serv-

ices of that recruit next year.

./\

"Yeah'." he smiled." ‘my plans-

would be to stay. I.still believe
that I can be part of a good team
here. Even though some people
won't believe it. we; came real

. close this year. If we were get-

ting blown off the court. I might
be discouraged. If I was the Pitt
student. I‘d probably be saying
the same thing they are saying
how."

BUZZ RIDL
Hoop Coach In '73

College basketball officiating has come under heavy.

criticism in recent years, and much of it _is quite justified. »
 The supervision of officials. at least in this area. is practi-
.~-3” cally non-existant. and what supervision does occur. is done

by the home team.

A man named Dave Fawcett is in charge of appointing
officials for all college games in Western Pennsylvania.
Fawcett has over 70 certified whistle-toters to choose from.
but try to remember anyone other than Cliff Feher or Ed-
die’Pl‘anck that has done a'Pitt game.

Unlike the National Hockey League. for example. N

which has four supervisors to cover a maximum of eight
games. Fawcett has none. not even himself. And there are
a lot more than eight games going on _in Western ‘Pennsyl-

vania many nights.

Fawcett instead relies on comments from the coaches.
Many coaches, such as Duquesne’s Red Manning, never
evaluate officials. Most visiting coaches realize that it is
futule to complain about ‘away-from-home officiating, since
chances are it will be two years. until they -return" to an

' area.

The path for an official is clear; Satisfy the home
coach and you‘ll be sent there again by Fawcett. The more
games you work. the more money you make, so why antag-
onize Red Manning or Buzz Ridl and lose a, source of in-

come?

The pay for college officials is quite. good. considering
the, number of hours put in. Western Pa.. referees receive
$50.00 per game. with no money for traveling expenses.
ACC and Big Ten refs get $125.00 per ‘game. plus 12 cents

per mile traveling expenses.

Whenaa split crew, is used, the higher pay scale is
used. That absurd ACC official who came here for the Vir-
ginia game got as much travel money as he did pay. He
came all the way from South Carolina. 1

Of course when you are the visiting half of a split
crew. you take care of the visiting coach. as he is the man
. .v.-.— you must make happy.

-1

' The result is what you would expect to happen in split

crew games. The two officials compete with each other.
and any possibility of the best team winning_ depends on
whether its ot'l'ictal can dominate the opposing otticial;

In the Virginia game, Eddie Planck was so dominated
by the ACC ref that one Pitt alumni screamed to the south-

ern ‘Official, “Hey ref, who’s your

to Planck.

ball boy,” in reference

College basketball has thus become a home-team wins
situation more often than it should.

Several proposals have been made to remedy the situ-
ation. although Fawcett doesn't think it's -that bad. Bring-
ing in two neutral officials. as well as having three ‘referees
for each game. has been proposed._but-in both cases. money

\

A ' (Continued on Page _11) -

 

What the students and other
Pitt basketball fans have been
saying is that Ridl hasn‘t won
big. even though he has brought
Pitt back to respectability. Among
other things——which thus far has
been nothing but idle talk—fans
have said that Ridl might step
down from his position and the
more vocal ones think he should
be asked to. Rumors"‘have had

i Ridl leaving by his own choice.

being fired. and. in some cases.
word has it that a replacement
has already been sought out.

“When I feel I’m hurting the
situation, I’ll gladly step down
as “coach,” Ridl explained. “It’s
not that our theories have failed,
it’s not that we don’t believe in
our offenseand our defense, it’s
that we were involved in a lot
of close _games.”

Apparently. Ridl doesn‘t believe
he is the clog standing in the
way of Pitt wins. b

Ridl. who came to a very weak
setup at Pitt from a strong pro-
gram at Westminister. has bossed
the Pitt forces to a 50-48 record.
during the last four years.

His best team was the 1970-71
squad, which boasted the tal-
ents of Bill Downes, Kent Scott,
Paul O’Gorek, and Mike Paul,
not to mention Cleveland Ed-

~ wards and Buzzy Harrison. Sport-

ing a final 14-10 record, that
team defeated the likes of Du-
quesne and North Carolina State.
Also, that team gave the Sidney
Wickes led UCLA team a fight

Skaters Nip Vinnies 

I by BART MACK
Associate Sports Editor

Une look at the St. Vincent Hockey Club last’

night at the Alpine Ice Chalet wouldn‘t have des-
cribed a team that won onlyfour games all season.
Pitt finally beat the Vinnies. 3-2. but it didn't come
about until 8:31 in sudden death.

Goalie Andy Labraska turned away almost ev-
erthing Pitt could throw at him to take his team
into the locker room tied at 2-2 after the three regu-
lation periods. Denny Browne got the game winner
only until Labraska had pulled out every trick in the
book.

St. Vincents actually took the lead in the first
period on a fluke goal by -Mike Bernacki. The puck
wasshot high to the left of Pitt netminder Mark
Lieberman but Joe Dver managed to deflect it back
out" in front of the crease. The’ puck sailed of Ber-

nacki past Lieberman. who refuted the goal to the .

referee. claiming that it was gloved in. Lieberman
protested in vain and with only 3:08 gone. Pitt was
down by a goal.

‘ Labraska then took the spotlight and used his

quick glove hand to rob the Pitt skaters blind. Pitt,

outshot St. Vincent, 19-3, in the first period and
Phil Clarke had to make a picture perfect play to
keep Pitt even with the Vinnies after the first 15
minutes. i

It was the Lush Line once again that came
through for Pitt. each member getting a goal for
their night's work. Billy Glanville fed a sharp pass
from the co_rner to Labraska.'s right andClarke de-
flected the puck from just outside the crease into
the open‘ corner before Labraska knew what was
happening. .

The Vinnie netminder put on a repeat per-
formance in the second period. stopping 20 shots.
Glanville. with help from Clarke and Browne. gave
Pitt the lead in the dying moments of the second
period. t

Labraska had shut out the skaters all period
long, catching most of the shots with his glove. His
style was to flop down tohis knees, his legs cover-
ing for shots along the ice, and his glove to catch
anything above. Glanville finally caught him flat on
the ice with three seconds left in the period.

‘When a goaltender lets a puck in late in the

. period. his team usually loses their momentum.

St. Vincent came out for‘ the; third period and

changed the script only slightly. Pitt put a mere 16

shots on goal and Labraska" was at his best. _

Associated Press

UCLA‘s Bill Walton. the '_'Big
Red Machine" of college basket-
ball. and another California gold-
en boy—Ed Ratleff of Long Beach
State—were named to the Asso-
ciated Press 1973 All-America
team Monday.

The standout UCLA center and
super Long Beach State guard.
the onl_v repeaters from 1972.
were joined in theselect circle by
three Eastern stars —— forward
David Thompson of North Caro-
lina State: guard Ernie DiGre-
gorio of Providence. and center
Kermit Washington of American
University.

Despite bad knees. Walton was

a runaway choice for first team
All-America. picked by the na-
tion‘s sports writers and broad-
casters. _ _

The six-foot-ll junior, a bony
redhead, dominated just about
every game this season for top-
ranked and unbeaten Bruins. Wal-,
ton’s average of about 20 points
and 17 rebounds a game were
only part of his contribution to his
team. His true worth was meas-
ured in shot-blocking, intimidation
and as trigger man in UCLA's pol-
ished fast-break.

’Ratleff. leader of Long Beach’s
Pacific Coast Athletic Associa-

tion champions. was another easy
All-America choice. The beefy.
6-6 senior averaged 23 points a
game this season.

Thompson is only 18 years old
but already coveted by profes-
sional teams. Considered by
some to be the‘most exciting
player in college this season.
Thompson has been rated by one
scout among America's top 10
basketball players——inc1uding pro
and college.

-The flashy, 6-4 sophomore ex-
cited crowds this season with a
facility to out-jump players sev-
eral inches taller. He averaged
26 points a game, leading the At-

lantic Coast Conference, and was

the heart of a North Carolina State
team that went undefeated
through 27 games.

DiGregorio is a ball—handling
wizard who personally took
charge of Providence and moved
the Friars into NCAA playoffs
with a 23-2 regular season record.

DiGregorio averaged 24 points
a game. many of them on long_
shots. The fans love him best
when he knifes through a crowd
for a basket inside or shoots a
behind-the-back pass to a team-
mate underneath for an easy lay-
up.

Ref Show

(Continued from Page 9)
has led to the downfall of the idea.

The Big Ten is using three officials this season, and
there have been fewer fouls, as the tendency for one ref
to compete with the other is lessened when there is a third
man there.

Meanwhile. lack of supervision is a big problem. as
well as the fact that there is no age limit set on when a
whistle-tooter must retire. .

The subject of showboating officials was put before
Fawcett. “We tell them not to do it." he said. But many
of them do. In the Pitt-Penn State game at» University Park
for instance. the ref would run towards the basket as if he
were shooting a layup. then circle around toward the scor-

-ers table. all the while with his arm on the back of his

neck. finally calling out charging. sending the fans wild
with delight.

The above description sounds" like Pitt cheerleader
“Tiger” Paul Auslander, and while it’s fine for a cheerlead-
er, it is bush for an official. Of course who is going to stop
him? ' "

Fawcett insists that the officials aren‘t that important.
"The team that has the horses wins the ball games.” he
says. Unless your name is UCLA_ or NC St.. you better
have a few zebras in your herd.
