stadium bond sale in 1924, and of the
ﬁrst Cathedral campaign, which raised
over $8,000,000.

Hovde Speaks On
Europe

1 An interpretation of the con-
temporary European political
situation will be made tomor-
row by Dr. B, J. Hovde, asso-
ciate professor of history, at
the Inquiry forum in Room 315,
Alumni hall, at 12:30 o’clock.

The discussion will consider
the possibly far-reaching effects
of the political manipulations of
Fascists and Nazis against the
inroads of collectivism, the
“iron ring” around Austria,
English attempts to keep clear
of continental alliances, and
French efforts to avoid ﬁnancial
chaos.

Dr. Hovde will present his in-
terpretation of these European
tendencies during the ﬁrst part
of the hour, and the customary
audience discussion will follow.

Kappa Sigs Get
House Remodeled

Repair Work Includes Complete
Renovation Of Lower Floor

With temporary lighting and plumb-
ing systems installed, and seven mem-
bers moved back into their ﬁre-razed
fraternity house, Kappa Sigma mem-
bers looked forward today to many
improvements which they expect will
result from the actual reconstruction
work which begins this week.

The dining room, pantry and an ad-
joining room, completely ruined ten

part of the building are smaller than

those in the lower twenty floors and,
their completion is not as urgent as,
the others. It will be possible to com- I
plete the “rough ﬁnished" rooms out

of the regular expenses of the Univer-

sity when they are needed. _

VVith interest in the completion of
the Cathedral becoming a civic topic
throughout the city, hopes for aquick
and successful campaign have been
greatly stimulated. Dr. John G. Bow-
man, Chancellor of the University,
struck the keynote of both civic and
student attitude when he said, “The
desire that the Cathedral of Learn-
ing be ﬁnished is in the air, and its
completion will mark the beginning
of a new era in education at the Uni-
versity.”

Shelton Speaks
f|To French Club

Present State Of French Aﬁ'airs
Told To Le Cercle Francais

 

According to Dr. Whitford H. Shel-
ton, chairman of the modern language
department, who addressed “Le Cercle
Francais" Friday, the downfall of the
Daladier regime was due to Daladier’s
disregard the people’s will, while
he sought to strengthen his own

power.

Dr, Shelton proceeded to explain
the fear of German invasion in the
minds of the French, This fear of in-
vasion and also the desire for the
establishment of military fortiﬁca-
tions, he said, Daladier overlooked,
but they must not be overlooked by
the new National Union of ex-Presi-
dent Doumergue.

Dr. Shelton reviewed the trends of
French government from the ancient
regime of absolute monarchy to the
present political set—up, where Imper-
ialists, Republicans, Conservatives, So-
cialists and Communists are each try-
ing to gain the controlling hand,

Also contributing to the present
political instability, he explained, is
the economic situation. After the
\Vorld War, when great damage was
done to French commerce and in-.
dustry, the French demanded
enormous sums for reparation.

All of these factors, Dr. Shelton
said, incited the Frenchpeople to
rioting and revolt.

Before Dr. Shelton spoke the club
discussed plans for a soiree to take
place soon. Anthony Henrici, G. pres-
ident. appointed a committee, com-
posed of Miss Blossom Henry, as-
sistant professor of modern languages,
Marguerite Chalmers, vice president,
and Josephine Cannistra, secretary-
treasurer, to decide the choice of play
for the soiree and to conduct the try-
outs.

Graduate Fellowships

Throughout the year the Graduate
school has received announcements
of fellowships and scholarships from
various universities. Seniors who are
interested are invited to call imme-
diately at Room 205, State hall,

days ago, will be renovated and made
into one long combination ballroom
and dining room. A wide archway will
connect the two rooms.

Floors damaged by water will be
sanded and reﬁnished. All the down-
stairs walls that were untouched by
the ﬁre, which swept through the rear
part of the house only, will be cleaned
and repainted. Upstairs walls, dam-
aged by smoke and heat, will be re-
papered.

Contractors estimated the damage
at $5,000 and said that repair Work
would not be completed for nearly two
months. During that period no meals
will be served in the house, and mem-
bers will be obliged to live in three
upstairs rooms and the dormitory, Wil-
liam V. Keller, C34, said.

Members who have been living in
the house since the ﬁre ten days ago,
rejoiced yesterday afternoon with the
ﬁnal completion of the temporary
plumbing system, which brought hot
water into the house. Those who have
been washing and shaving in ice cold
‘water for over a week held a mock
ceremony celebrating the event.

Women Students
To Give Opinion
About New Name

Women Administrative Officers,
Women Faculty Members
To Receive Vote

By Marjorie Reich.

Because for the past ﬁve or six
years the program of work of the
Women’s Self-Government association
has been broader than the description
of its work set forth in the existing
by-laws, a committee was appointed to
revise the constitution. This commit-
tee, consisting of Dorothy Wanner,
C34, chairman, Anne June Elmer, C36,
Lois Young, C35, and Marjorie Reich,
C35, has made a revision of the con-
stitution, to be acted upon by the
Executive committee and Commission,
and will then be submitted to the
women students of the University at
the general election, to take place
April 11 for approval,

For a number of years there has
been a discussion of the present name
of the organization because many wo-

men students have felt that the word
“goveriiment” carries the wrong con-
notation for the place which this or-
ganization ﬁlls iii an urban univer-
sity such as the University of Pitts-
burgh. The committee would like sug-
gestions which would carry the pur-
pose of the association at little more
clearly than does the present name.
The ballot for this purpose is reprinted
below. Ruth Bowser, president of
VVSGA, made the following statement
concerning the revision of the by-
laws, and the proposed change in
name: '

“For a number of years the work
which the Women’s Self Government
association has done has been broader
than its name and existing constitu-

will play while the guests are as-~

tion indicate. The emphasis in the or-
ganization’s activities is placed on
building a creative program for the
{enrichment of student life rather than
in deﬁning and restricting the activity
of the individual or the group. The
many suggested changes in the by-
laws tend toward the growth of the
organization in new ﬁelds of interest
to women. Pitt women attach a cer-
ltaiii amount of sentiment to the W0-
men’s Self Government association,
and will probably ﬁnd it difﬁcult to

name. However we must think of the
real function of the association and
of its connotation to others through
the name by which it is Known. The
ballot in the Pitt News assures all
members an expression of opinion
about the proposed change of name.”

The committee also proposes to
give voting power to women faculty
members, and women administrative
ofﬁcers. The students, faculty and
administrative ofﬁcers have worked in
close co-operation in the solution of
all problems, and these by—laws are

Turner Denies Determinist Theories
Of History Before Science Seminar

By Israel L. Goldberg
Emphasiziiig the complex nature of any historical process, Dr. Ralph E.
[Turner, associate professor of history, addressed the social science seminar
:Fi‘iday on “The cultural interpretation of history.”
V Denying any narrow determiiiist theory of historical thought, Dr. Turner
Edefended the view that history is but a sequence of various cultures, and
Etllﬂt the individual, being part of the wider social group, is but the carrier
;

V

 

of culture.

According to the speaker, ﬁve types
of historical determinism have been
proposed by iioii-professional histo-
rians. The Christian intcrpetation,
which he declared was ﬁrst advanced
in the ﬁfth century by St, Augustine
in “The City of God,” is the ﬁrst of
these. Further clariﬁed by Bossuet
and Von Schlegel, the theory is
characterized by pessimism and con-
servatisin.

The idea of progress, propounded
by Gibbon in the “Decline and Fall,”
represents to Dr. Turner the second
attitude toward history. Defenders of
this view, he said, maintain that man
knows natural law and is thus able

r

to inﬁueiice his own destiny.

Dr. Turner also attacked the Marx-
ian, or economic theory, and the
philosophies of racial and geographi-
cal determinism. “All these theor-
ies," he declared, “belong to religion
and not to history.”

“Professional historians have no
theory of history,” he asserted, “Re-
ligious determinism was advanced by
theological dogmatists, the principle
of progress by eighteenth century ra-
tionalists, the class struggle by
proletarian intellectuals, the program
of racial superiority by patrioteers of
declining prestige, the geographical
determinism only by geographers.”

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg
Being a drama about the NRA, in which General
Johnson plays a leading role.

Scene: Office of General Johnson.

General Johnson is seated at his desk, surrounded
by the customary entourage of newspapermen.

Johnson: VVell, boys, how’s everything?

Newspapermen: Fine, General Johnson, ﬁne.

Johnson: What do you want to know?

Newspapermen: Make a couple of dirty cracks
about the opponents of the NRA, in the good old
Style that makes such excellent copy.

Johnson: Sure, that’s easy. Just give me a few
minutes in which to think.

Several minutes elapse while General
thinks. He speaks.

Johnson: You can quote me as saying that a. lot
of little-minded, misinformed business men are at-
tempting to impede the progress and horn-swoggle
the advance of this country’s interests, through their
malicious attempts to further their own fortunes. We
are willing to take into recognition and study the
criticisms of men who we believe to be generally in
accord with the best interests of the United States,
but we'll bully-rag anyone we think is trying to
chisel.

Paul Anderson; correspondent of the St. Louis
Post—Dispatch and the Nation: T‘hat’s pretty fair,
General, pretty fair. But it’s not strong enough. How
about saying at the end, “I/Ve’ll give them hell?”

Johnson: Hell? Hell? I don’t know, I-lell’s all
right for the army, but for general use, isn‘t it a lit-
tle risque?

Robert Allen, co-author of VVashington Merry-
Go-Round: Yeah, and what will the New York Times
do? How will the Times print it?

Anderson: Maybe the Times can skip an edition
tomorrow. They’ve been putting out a paper too
long, anyway. Furthermore, think of the eyes that
would be saved if there were no New York Times
to read.

Drew Pearson, other co-author of Washington
Merry—Go-Round: Yeah, but what would all the eye
doctors do, if there were no Times to read?

Johnson: That’s right. We have to take care of
the eye doctors. After all, the NRA takes care of
everybody. Sorry, Paul, but maybe I better not use
hell.

Anderson: To hell with the eye doctors. Look,
General, at all the space and praise I've given you in
the Nation. I've even said that John Flynn doesn’t
know anything about the NRA. And look at the way
I cracked down on Borah and Nye when they started
to raise a rumpus in the Senate about the NRA.
Doesn't that deserve something?

Johnson: I know, Paul, but remember the eye

doctors. I can't have them starving on my hands.
I have enough people starving on my doorstep as
it is. I’ll tell you what I will do, though. I’ll give
you a personal interview, and you can use hell as
often as you want. How's that?

Anderson: That’s 0. K.

Other newspapermen: How about us? If An-
derson is going to get a personal interview with hell
in it, we want something, too.

Johnson: I almost forgot you boys. Sorry. Well,

I don’t know what I can do for you. Let me think.

Parenthetical: This man Johnson thinks too much.
I don’t know how to represent him as he thinks. I
could use a blank space, but that might be taken to
imply something not very complimentary to General
Johnson, instead of being understood as representing the
mere passage of time. Furthermore, the editor doesn’t
like blank space. Next week, I'll write for you another
little drama entitled, “Why an Editor Doesn't Like Blank
Space, or An Analytical Review of the New York Times,
80 Pages Long.”

The general has concluded his thinking and is
speaking.

Johnson: How about you boys quoting me as
willing to smack in the breadbasket any industrial-
ist who doesn’t give his workers enough time to eat
cake with their coffee at their lunch?

Newspapermen: Smack in the bread basket?
Coffee! Cake! That’ll be 0. K. We can write that
General Johnson says, “Let ’Em Eat Cake.”

Allen: Be careful what you say. There was a
showing running in New York called, “Let ’Em Eat
Cake.” General Johnson might be sued for plagiar-
lSm

Johnson

Johnson: Is that so? I hadn’t thought of that.
How are we going to get around that?
Newspaperman: Send for Chief Justice Hughes
and see what he thinks.
Chief Justice Hughes is duly sent for, appears,
and the problem is presented to him. He speaks.
Hughes: Well, that‘s a weighty problem, indeed.
I’m not sure that I can settle it by myself and with-
out the proper use of precedents and antecedents.
(Antecedent isn't the correct word, I know, but Chief
Justice Hughes doesn’t, so we’ll let it remain. Any-
way, who’s writing this column, you or me?) l’ll tell
you what I will do. I'll call a session of the Supreme
Court and we can decide in conference.

Parenthetical: Do you see how I’m progressing? I
started with only General Johnson and the newspaper-
men, and now I have on my hands the entire Supreme
Court and I don’t know what to do with it. I'll appreci-
ate letters furnishing ideas as to what to do with the
Supreme Court, and I offer anyone the chance of writing
this column two weeks from today, if he can get rid of
the Supreme Court without the use of a deus ex machina.
But back to the play.

The members of the Supreme Court are called, and

soon appear.

Justice Hughes emerges and speaks.

Hughes: We don’t know what to do. We sug-
gest that experts from the Congressional Library be
sent for.

Experts from the Library come, hear the problem,

Let Pitt Help

“WE NEED VERY deﬁnitely practical contacts be-

tween the collegiate and educational world and
the operations of government,” announced President
Roosevelt in an address at the founding of the new
School of Public Affairs at American university in Wash-
ington. “We need a trained personnel in government,”
the President said.

In the last issue of the Pitt News we suggested that
the mayor of the City of Pittsburgh appoint a Commit-
tee on Municipal Affairs, comprised of outstanding ex-
perts in municipal problems at Pitt, to assist him in the
dilemna he is facing in his administration of the city’s
aﬁairs. The University’s departments of sociology,
economics, and political science are replete with ex-
perts in every phase of city government. These men
ought to ‘be allowed to contribute their services to the
city in this crisis.

Mayor McNair recently took a trip to Baltimore.
Ostensibly he was interested in the progress that city
has made in lowering taxation and in general municipal
administrative efficiency. Mayor Jackson of Baltimore
showed Mayor McNair around, and Mayor McNair was
eloquent in calling Pittsburgh “broke.” Pittsburgh may
not have actual cash in the bank, because taxpayers are
too busy scraping pennies to feed and clothe their fam-
ilies. Pittsburgh may be "broke” in actual cash, but it
isn’t “broke” in credit and it isn’t “broke” in the num-
ber of intellectuals and experts who can readily be sum-
moned to lead the city out of its difliculties.

The “bloodhounds” of budget, taxation, housing, and
appointments are tracking “Eliza” McNair as she a bit
unsteadily carries infant City Administration, barely
two months old, across the ice. And the storms over
City Hall these days make a perfect setting for our
parody on Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

Psalm of an Engineer’s Sweetheart
Verily, I say unto ye, marry not an engineer;
For an engineer is a strange being, and is possessed of
many evils;

Yea, he speaketh eternally in parables which he calleth
formulae,

And he wieldeth a big stick which he calleth a slide
rule, V ’

And he hath only one Bible, a hand book.

He thinketh only of strains and stresses, and without
end of thermo-dynamics.

He showeth always a serious aspect and seemeth not
to know how to smile;

And he picketh his seat in a car by the springs therein
and not by the damsels.

Neither does he know a waterfall except by its horse-
power, nor" a sunset except that he. must turn on the
lights, nor a damsel except by her live weight.

Always he carrieth his books with him, and he enter-
taineth his sweetheart with steam tables.

Verily, though his damsel expecteth chocolates when
he calleth, she openeth the package to disclose samples
of iron ore.

Yea, he holdeth her hand but to measure the friction
thereof; and kisseth her only to test the viscosity of her
lips, for in his eyes there shineth a faraway look that is
neither love nor longing . . . rather a vain attempt to
recall a formula.

Even as a boy he pulleth a girl’s hair but to test its
elasticity;

But as a man he discovereth different devices . .

For he counteth the vibrations of her heart strings and

He seeketh ever to pursue his scientiﬁc investigations.

Even his own heart ﬂutterings he counteth as a vision
of beauty,

And enscribeth his passion as a formula.

And his marriage is :1 simultaneous equation involving
two unknowns,

And yielding diverse results.

Verily, I say unto ye, marry not an engineer.

confer, and then straighten up and sing.

Experts sing:

We don’t know what to do, we only study books.
‘We never take an action, we’re intellectual gazooks.
Ideas are what we have, action’s what we lack.
We are no men of deeds, we’re just literary hacks.

! Johnson: Get that octet out of here. Who in-
vited them, anyway? Now, as for this plagiarism
‘business, how about calling Congress over here to
pass a law to make it legal for me to say, “Let ’Em
Eat Cake.”
Congress come and throngs the room.

Johnson sings:

What’s wanted most is a Congressional law

To save me from committing a faux pas.

I’n1 just a soldier boy with manners rough;

Where I come from we take no nasty guff.

In Washington you have to watch your lip,

Or else you will be thrown upon your hip.

I like my job, the President likes me,

But if I make a slip, then goodby me.

What I want from you is to pass a law

To save him from committing a faux pas.
Newspapermen sing:

What’s wanted most is a Congressional law

To save him from omitting a faux pas.

Congress sings:

The people like the President so much,

That all we do is nicely to him gush;

And every time the President should speak.

Vve always act so very, very meek.

And we will oh! so gladly pass a l-aw

To save you from committing a faux pas.

All stand and sing in great rejoicing:

The NRA is very good, _ ~

It means a loving brotherhood;

And all is well with USA,

That’s it‘ we have our NRA.

Lamp-post

By Wilbur D. Clark

Gramps slouched in the big chair in
front of the electric ﬁre place, picked
up a lighter and lit his old briar and
then switched on the newsograph.
The mellow voice reading the day’s
newspaper ﬁlled the room. “Pitts-
burgh News. March 6, 1964.. The
weather prediction: Much colder to-
night with possible near zero tem-
peratures by morning. ‘Continued cold
tomorrow.” Gramps switched the
phone off, leaned back and remarked
to his grandson, Jack, who was look-
ing at the pyramids through his new
viz-a-glass, that the winters weren't
what they used to be.

“Yeah,” said Jack, not looking up.
He was looking at the Alhambra
through the glass now.

“Yeah,” echoed Gramps. “You ought
to have been around back in the
winter of ’33-'34. That was a. real
winter.” He sucked his pipe, straight-
ened out his leg, wiggled his great
toe and regarded his swinging slip-
per thoughtfully. “Yep, that was a
man’s winter. It was zero for months
at a time.”

“And the snow was six inches
deep,” supplemented Jack, “or maybe
it was six feet deep.” He was looking
at the snow-capped Alpine peaks.

Gramps snorted, but not being
easily stopped, continued. “I was a
young fellow then, VVe lived along-

side the railroad tracks and one night

I left the window open. Steam from
the passing trains blew in and in the
morning I couldn’t close the window.
The steam had frozen in the open
window.”

Jack said nothing. The story had

a-graph.

Gramps tried again. “An’ the suicide
rate among old men rose sharply that
year. It was terrible. Old men were
hanging themselves and shooting

all over the country. They started an
investigation and decided, ﬁnally, that
the old men couldn’t stand the dis-
grace. They had been talking in the
years before of the cold wi11ters of
their youth and then along came the
jwinter of ’34, which was so cold that
ltheir stories no longer were any
‘ good.”

12 Fraternities
Pledge 35 Men
As Rushing Ends

To the lapels of thirty-ﬁve men,
many of them second semester fresh-
men and upperclassmen, were af-
fixed shining pledge buttons VVednes-
day evening, when the results of the
most conservative second semester fra-
ternity rushing season in a number of
years were announced.

Only 124 bids were extended to but,
ninety-eight men at the close of the
rushing season last Monday morning.‘
The thirty—ﬁve acceptances were to
twelve of the thirteen social frater-
nities on campus.

Kappa Sigma pledged the largest;
number, taking in eleven new men-l
illmost one—third of the total nun1ber.l
Next in line was Pi Kappa Alpha
(formerly Omega Delta, local frater-
nity) with six_ Phi Epsilon Pi pledged
three men, while the remaining groups
pledged one or two men each.

The rushing season itself was con-
siderably different from previous such
seasons here. Few affairs were spon-
sored by the fraternities and limited
numbers of men were rushed. An un-
usually small ﬁrst semester fresh-
man class and lack of many pros-
pective rushees who could afford the
ﬁnancial obligations of fraternity
membership probably account for the
weak results.

The prediction issued by Theodore
W. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men, as to the number of bids which
would be extended and the number
which would be accepted, was, for the
first time in at least four semesters,
rather far from correct. He prophesied
that 161 bids would be turned in for]
111 men, with ﬁfty-nine rushees ac-l
cepting. ‘

99 Women Pledge
To 16 Sororities
At Teas Sunday

There are ninety—nine new pledge
pins representing sixteen women’s so-
cial fraternities being worn on campus
for the ﬁrst time today. The pins
were received last night at formal
pledging ceremonies conducted by the
fraternities, and replaced the pledge
ribbons that the women have been
wearing since the “ribbon teas” which
took place on Sunday afternoon. The
teas marked the ﬁrst meeting together
of the fraternities and their new
pledge groups.

Pledging came as the culmination
of a successful rushing season spon-
sored by Panhellenic council. Formal
rushing by women’s fraternities ex-
tended from Thursday afternoon, Feb-
ruary 22, to Saturday midnight, Feb-
ruary 24, the beginning of silence
week.

Communication between fraternities
and their rushees was resumed last
Saturday when rushees received their
invitations to join the fraternity of
their choice. A trial period of at least
six weeks will be observed before
pledges become active fraternity mem-
bers: the list of new pledges is as fol-

Pitt Clinches Conference Title

By Beating

Pitt’s Golden Panthers clinched the honors in the Eastern Intercollegiate
basketball conference and moved a step nearer to the proposed game in New
York by beating the Owls of Temple Saturday night, 38-34.
in the closing minutes of the game gave the crippled Panthers a hard-earned

victory.

After a good start which found Ochsenhirt netting two foul shots, the
Pitt ﬁve took a back seat before the play of an inspired Temple quintet who

Temple In Thriller

A brilliant rally

piled up a 21-16 lead by a spurt at the:

close of the ﬁrst half. After the inter-
mission, the Panthers began the slow
process of pecking away at the Tem-
ple lead until ﬁnally, with the count at
31-29, Skip Hughes looped a ﬁeld goal
to tie up the game. Slim Wainio
promptly made good on a foul shot and
the Carlsonmen were ahead at last.

A ﬁeld goal by Rosan, Temple’s ace
forward, sent the Owls ahead again
and sent the Philly fans into an up-
roar.
the game at this point and his ﬁeld
goal and foul put the Panthers deﬁ-
nitely ahead.

Once in the lead, Pitt kept the game
well in hand, displaying once more a
dazzling series of passes which en-
abled them to hold possession of the
ball for almost two minutes at one
time.

The Panther win practically settles
matters in the Eastern Intercollegiate
conference. Pitt is ﬁrmly entrenched
in ﬁrst place and the Owls must be
content to ﬁnish third. In seven con-
ference games thus far the Panthers
have a clean slate and the game with
the VI/est Virginia Mountaineers Sat-
urday night will close Pitt’s activity
in the league.

The Mountaineers are in second
place in the league standings, having
humbled Bucknell’s Bisons Saturday
by a 57-18 count.

Little Panthers
Win Two Games

Roll Up Total Of 123 Points On
Consecutive Evenings

Coach Paul Zehfuss’ freshman quin-
tet added two more victories to their
long list of wins by walloping the
Western Pennsylvania Institute for
the Deaf last Friday night and nos-
ing out the Kiski ﬁve the following
evening,

The little Panther had somewhat
of a romp at the expense of the In-
stitute passers, rolling up seventy
points while their opponents were get-
ting twenty-three. Billy Jesko ac-
counted for eighteen points from his
forward position to lead the scorers.

Playing at Saltsburg the following
night, the frosh had a bit more of a
ﬁght on their hands. Going into the
game without the services of Center
Joe Garcia, whose height would have
aided the Pitt cause considerably
against the big Kiski boys, Zehfuss’s
men started off with the same ex-
cellent shooting form which they had
displayed the preceding night.

The roughness of the game and its
accompanying results hampered the
Panthers after the ﬁrst half and en-
abled the Kiski boys to chop away
the Pitt lead. Putting on steam when
it was necessary, the ﬁrst year men
managed to stay ahead until the ﬁnal
whistle left the score at 53-51. Em-
erick, with sixteen points, was the
star for the winners.

By rolling up 123 points in two eve-
nings the little Panthers must have
set up some sort of a record. All of
which means that Zehfuss has a
bunch of crack shots at his disposal
who may be heard from later. The
freshmen’s next scheduled game is
with West Virgina freshmen at Mor-
gantown.

In his discussion, he stated that in
the past 3,300 years, the world has
spent more time in war than in peace.
In the past three centuries 286 years
have been spent in war, and there
have been about 3,000 treaties of

average life of which has been two
years,

Enter N. Y. Meet

Wagenhouser, Fleming, Albright
Make Trip With Coach Olson

Although the ﬁnal results from
Thursday’s telegraphic track and ﬁeld
meet between the Pitt trackmen and
the Navy are not deﬁnitely known as
yet, the performance of two Panther
runners in that meet prompted Coach
Olson to take them along for the In-
tercollegiate association indoor meet
run off at New York last night.

Arvel Fleming showed ﬁne form in
the 50-yard dash on Thursday, turning
in a time of 5.5 seconds. Olson in-
tended to enter Fleming in the 60-
yard dash and also the running broad
jump in yesterday’s meet, the results
of which were too late to make to-
day’s issue.

Bill Albright, two-miler and cross-
country star, Was. taken along to en-
ter the two-mile event in New York,

after stepping off that distance in
good time in the Navy meet. Ken
Wagenhouser, ace distance man, was
a deﬁnite Pitt entry the 3,000
metre run.

The next event on the Pitt track
card is the Central Intercollegiate
meet at Notre Dame on Saturday.

Panthers May Capture Eastern
Swimming Association Title
In Meet At Delaware

Althouoh the Varsity’s schedule of
dual swimming meets, in which the
Panthers outscored all of their com-
petitors, has been completed, it still
faces its greatest test of the season,;
the Eastern Swimming association
championships. The meet will take
place in the Delaware university pool
on Saturday, March 10. This year
Coach Pat Corr’s swimmers stand a
ﬁne chance of establishing themselves
as the outstanding swimming team
in Eastern collegiate swimming cir-
cles. 

Rutgers and New York universityé
are the two teams that will give the
Panthers the most trouble in the ﬁght
for the Eastern championship. It is
very doubtful, however, that either
team will be capable of matching in
all-around strength the team that
Coach Corr has been drilling all year.
