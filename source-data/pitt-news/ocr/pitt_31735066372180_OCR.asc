Jury Being Selected

Jury selection for the trial of
Sidney Brinkley. a Philadelphia-
area man charged in the
strangulation-murder of a Pitt
woman in the basement ofLitch-
field Towers in January of I979,
will begin tomorrow.

If convicted. Brinkley may be
able to avoid the death penalty
for the third time in two years if
Common Pleas Judge Ralph
Cappy remains firm in his deci-
sion not to inform prospective
jurors of Brinkley’s prior convic-
tions on two counts of first-
degree murder and one count of
"second-degree murder.

The decision to exclude the
information in any instructions
to the jury was based on the fact
that the crimes were committed
after the Jan. 2, I979 slaying of
Pitt student Monica Renee
Jones.

Grease in the duct work was the
apparent cause of a three—alarm fire
that swept through the kitchen area
of Pitt’s Faculty Club on Friday
;night, according to an offical report
‘from the Pittsburgh Fire
Department.

Officials on the scene said that
between 30 and 35 people were
inside the club when the fire started.
Everyone was evacuated. and there
were no reports of injury.

Dafna Wachin. a senior Pitt stu-
dent working in the kitchen when
the fire broke out. said that she first
saw smoke coming from the ceiling.
and the light fixturesthroughout the
dining room area at about 5:45 p.m.

By b;l8. according to fire officials. a
call was received by Oakland‘s No.
l4 Engine company.

Within an hour of the initial call.
nine pumpers and several other pie-
ces of fire fighting equipment from
two additional companies had
arrived on the scene.

Wachin said that at first no one
thought there was a problem.

“There was smoke, but that
happens regularly when you are
cooking,“ Wachin said. “We didn’t
think it was serious just a chance to
get offwork for l0 minutes, but then
a policewoman Came into the kit-
chen and told us to get out. the place
was being evacuated.“ -

State, Pitt Talk On
Budget Concerns

By SETH LU BOVE

Pill NEWS‘Sl(lil Writer

The first of a series of meetings
between state education department
officials» and Pitt to discuss universi-
ty’s fiscal year I983 appropriations
and budget request went “quite
well,” according to Jack Freeeman,
senior vice chancellor for
administration.

The meeting, held Thursday in
Harrisburg, was attended by Free-
man, two members of the state
Department of Education and one

I official from the state budget office.

Freeman addressed the financial
worries that currently plague Pitt.

“We met with them and I gave a
brief presentatiom, simply summar-
izing the concerns that we have
about the budget and the problem of
medical school tuition,” Freeman
said. B

Freeman described the affair as a
routine meeting, held this time of
year to help the secretary of educa-
tion develop his department‘s
budget, which will be intergrated
into the state, or executive budget.

Most of the questions directed
toward Pitt were “educational,”
Freeman said. The queries centering
on the specifics of Pitt’s relationship

Jack Freeman

with the state were asked mainly by
state officials attending the meeting
for the first time.

Pitt has been a state-related insti-
tution since l966. Sincethen Pitt has
received a large portion ofits operat-
ing budgetfrom the state in yearly
appropriations. Other state-related
include Penn State, Lincoln and
Temple universities._

pite a flare-up that occurred an hour
earlier. Officials on the scene said
that damage to the facility was
extensive. due mainly to the effects
of smoke and water. No figures are
available yet pending further investi-
gation by authorities at Pitt.

In addition to structural damage.

the fire has also put a number of

people temporarily out of a job.
including several Pitt students.

Wachin. who has worked at the
club for over a year. said that she
would like to return to work and is
willing to wait to see if the club will
reopen . She added that ifsomething
doesn’t happen soon she will have to
look elsewhere for a job.

The CAS Committee on Curricu-

that all students be required to take
courses in life sciences, such as biol-

chemistry, and a second course in a
different scientific field.

But Chemistry professor David
Hercules said the chemistry depart-
ment wanted physical and life
science majors to be considered as

Hercules said the proposed

majors take more science courses

A muscular man wearing a red
beret stands on the curb of a
crowded city street and yells. “Don‘t
smoke that stuff.“ at the occupants
of a passing Cadillac‘.

A group ot street kids dance to the
music of a large radio. Working up
their courage. they begin to sur-
round T.P. King. asking.“Hey man.
how old do you have to be tojoin the
Guardian Angels?“

T.P. King began the Pittsburgh
chapter of the Guardian Angels last
May. According to King. “The most
important function of this group is
setting up a positive role model for
young people. Today a kid goes into
the street and sees a person selling
more dope and making more money
in a half hour than his father makes
in a month. We want young people
to know that it can be cool to believe
in justice."

T.P. King has a special feeling for
young people. He says. “Young peo-
ple have a hard way to go in today’s
world. The system_just puts troubled
kids into detention centers like put-
ting them into a closet. Young peo-
ple have to know that they have a
part in the United States.”

to ever get it under control. I have a

I wouldn‘t put in so many hours

“Americans are tired of crime.
This past year. crime rose in the US.
by 90. Every twenty—three minutes a
major crime is committed." King
says. “The New York chapter has
been able to deter crime to a consid-
erable extent. We intend to do the
same thing in Pittsburgh."

The Guardian Angels have been
policing the downtown streets for
only two weeks and have already
been commended by police for their
fast and disciplined approach
towards criminal acts. They have
been instrumental in locatinga miss-
ing person and have halted various
acts of vandalism and street fights.

King says. “We aren’t trying to
compete with the police. we’d like to
work hand in glove with them. Some
of the police have been very friendly.
some silent. but none have been
negative.

‘‘Let‘s face it. the police need more
officers." King continues. “You

streets like you used to. You only see

The Guardian Angels carry no
weapons and adhere to a strict code
of nonviolence. King says. “We are
very discipline oriented; we don’t
give group members second chan-
ces. Any Angel caught hasseling
someone. carrying or using drugs or

weapons. or arguing with the police
is out immediately."

I he Angels are trained in self-
defense and emotional control. “To
bean Angel. a person must be cmo.
tionally stable. They have to be able
to turn the other check if someone

The Angels are seeking female.

recruits. “We want to be racially
mixed. We would like the image we
reflect to help lesson racial tension."
King says. “lfyoung people can see
that we can all work together to do

SAAC to Evaluate Lack of Student Involvement  

By CHRIS CLINTON

Assisttiiit News Etlilor

A university committee born in
the early ’70s because of “campus
troubles” is evaluating itself in order
to find ways to get more student
involvement.

At its first meeting last week. the
Student Affairs Advisory Commit-
tee questioned last year’s poor meet-
ing attendance and lack of agenda
topics.

SAAC was formed duringa time
when -the Pitt campus was expe-
riencing a great deal of unrest. A
number of administration officials
believed there was a need for open
communication between students
and administration. It was decided
that a committee consisting of both
student leaders and administrators

"I5I"l.Cl'ITJ

BUSINE

would serve to lessen the communi-
cation gap.

Student Goverment Board Presi-
dent Bill Abraham brought up the
question of the lack of involvement
and made suggestions on how to
remedy the situation.

“I think this committee needs to
be more creative and imaginative.“
he said.

He suggested first polling student
leaders to find out why they're not
attending the meetings. and then
meeting with Chancellor Wesley
Posvar to evaluate the findings.

Andy Smith. director of student
activies. suggested that Abraham
form a subcommittee and investi-
gate the roots of the problem.

“If I were the chancellor. I’d hate
to see this committee fall apart.”
Smith said.

5, INDUSTRY AN

The committee has been involved
in the deveopment of many student
interests in the past. Its accomplish-
ments include starting the campus
radio station. initiating the student
football season ticket program.
creating the “U-Bus“ in conjunction
with the Port Authority. establish-
ing a recreation room in the student
union and developing a campus bus
route.

Edward Bozik, assistant to the
chancellor. said the committee is
important because Posvar needs to
hear what’s happening “whether it
be good things or bad things."

Ideas related to getting greater
student involvemen.t will be dis-
cussed at future SAAC meetings.
committee members have agreed to
investigate and evaluate where the
problem lies.

last Thursday night in David Law-

“I work on love." Bailey said. “lfl

Bailey said there is no law that

with what she says.

“But tomorrow morning. w hen

what that woman said. but she said
something that makes me think."

People are always asking Bailey
what her job as a United Nations

"Do you know what l tell them?"
she said. “I tell them l
people.“

Bailey said the United .\’ations as

the most constructive bodies in the
world. but now it is destructive. She
added that the members should talk
about saving.’ respecting and loving
mankind. but many times they don‘t
pay attention to what is being said.

“Do you want to know my solu-
tion to this problem?” Bailey asked.
“I would suggest closing the bar in
the U.N. building. It’s a small one,
but it‘s crowdedf’.

  Serious Crimeon Downswin

By ROB GARDNER
Pin News Staff Writer

Serious crime at Pitt is on the
downswing, according to statis-
tics supplied by Lt. James Wat-
ters of the campus police.

The number of “Category
One,” or major, crimes reported
in Oakland so far during August
and September has dropped to
99. compared to I73 crimes
reported during the same period
in I980.

According to Watters. seven
crimes fall into Category One:
theft, assault. burglary, robbery,

He said the monitoring of these
crimes give a good indication of
the overall crime picture.

As of late last week. the break-
down ofCategory One crimes for

August-September l98l was 89
thefts. no assaults, nine burglar-
ies, one robbery, and no rapes,
kidnappings or homicides.

Budget

quite a bit of attention from the offi-
cials in attendance at the meeting.

“They (the state officials) listened
very attentively in respect particu-
larly to the problem of medical edu-
cation. which is a big part of our
pitch this year.“ Freeman said.

Pitt is asking the state for $85.5
million for fiscal year I983 to sup-
plement a proposed total budget of
$283.375.400. The request repres-
ents an increase ofS I08 million over
the fiscal year I982 appropriation.
or I4.5 percent.

Contained in that request is pro-
posed 5 percent increase in tuition.
which the university estimates will
bring in $3.85 I .000 for general ope_r-
ating expenses. That figure is based
on the I982 enrollment levels of
about 35.000 students.

This represents the first time Pitt
has gone into appropriations pro-
cess with a tuition hike already in
mind’. Freeman said that in the past
Pitt had requested appropriations
from the state amounting I8 or 20
percent above the preyious year's

appropriations. there was always an
“implicit assumption that we would
have to have a tuition increase of
some kind just to meet inflation.

It is pretty hard in the context of
reality to think that the state is really
going to do that (give Pitt an I8 or 20
percent appropriation increase)."

For the fiscal year I983 request.
Pitt thought it would be “more real-
istic to go in with a 5 percent prop-
osal. which is about less than halfof
inflation. and hope that by doing
that we could encourage the state to

continued from page one

be more responsive to our base
request." Freeman said.

Earlier this month Penn State
approved an appropriations request
to the state of $l49.8 million for ﬁs-
cal year l983.an increase of$l6 mil-
lion over last year‘s state allocation.

Penn State. like Pitt. is also
including in its appropriations
request a 5 percent tuition increase.
But unlike Pitt. Penn State‘s fiscal
year I982 appropriations request
also had a 5 percent tuition hike
included. which later increased to

I2. 6 percent when the budget was
finally ratiﬁed.

“It has been our belief that as we
have increased costs. there ought to
be a shring of the increase at least in
part by the students." said Penn
State President John W. Oswald
after the board oftrustees approved
Penn State's request.

“Our concern is that there has
been a shift of this sharing more
toward the students. and we are very
anxious to correct this."

The mayor added that Pitts-

the city’s infrastructure in order
to continue attracting commerce
and industry.

lJ.S. Congressman. James J.
Blanchard. another participant
at the hearing. proposed that a
recruiting bank be developed to

however the mayor expressed
worry that the grants the city
now receives would be sacrificed.

“I can't continue to borrow
money." Caliguiri. said. “I have
the ability to do so but can‘t
afford to pay it back with the
resources we have‘. Most of our
tax money finds its way to the
federal goverment, and I believe
it‘s about time it finds its way
back.”

Caliguiri told the subcommit-

tee that the City of Pittsburgh
receives nothing from the state

In the past without federal
funding. it would not have been
possible to complete many city

said. “Cities alone cannot replace

Foerster also stated his con-
cerns that the federal goverment

for Pittsburgh and other cities

“What concerns us at this time
is that the federal goverment
appears to be confusing interven-
tion with responsibility.” Foers-
ter said. “As our infrastructure

tions at the federal level have put

Fairness And
Fine Print

Jury selection begins Tuesday in the trial of
Sidney Brinkley, a Philadelphia construction
worker accused of killing a Pitt coed in 1979.

After the jury is selected and the trial be-
gins, however, a crucial element in deciding
Brinkley’s fate will be noticeably absent.

According to a Pennsylvania high court
ruling, the jury, even if it has already inde-
pendently found Brinkley guilty of the Jones
murder, cannot be told of Brinkley’s other
murder convictions to guide them in sentenc-
in .

Tf Brinkley is found guilty, the prosecution
may again request that he be given the death
penalty. But with the information about his
murder convictions being withheld from the
jury, it is possible that for the third time in
two years, Brinkley would escape that
penalty if convicted;

At least one Pennsylvania Supreme Court
justice has gone on record to criticize the
decision to withhold this information in this
case.

Despite the legal technicalities, Brinkley’s
entire record should be taken into account in
deciding his sentence, if he is judged guilty.

If Brinkley does indeed receive a fourth
conviction, he should be subject to his
appropriate punishment.

The court has stated that because Brink-
ley’s convictions occurred after the 1979
murder, only his record before the slaying
can be considered by the jury.

The excluded information could be a
decidingifactor if thejury has to decide upon
a sentence for Brinkley.

Brinkley has already received two first-
degree murder convictions and one second-
degree conviction for a series of murders that
occurred in the Philadelphia area.

He was found guilty of the murders of
27-year-old Kathryn Johns, Atlantic Rich-
field executive Nancy Ross, and Sheila Hill,
the 25-year-old sister of his former girlfriend.

In each case, the prosecution requested the
death penalty for Brinkley. and that request
was each time denied.

Now Brinkley will stand trial in Pittsburgh
for the strangulation—slaying of Monica
Renee Jones. the Pitt student whose body
was found in the basement of the Litchfield

Towers during the early morning hours of
Jan. 3. I979.

At Last: Solutions To Our Money Woes

By BILL JACKSON

News Item: Because of the infla-
tion and a new tight—fisted state
budget, tuition at the University of
Pittsburgh is going up again.

Hey, I feel real bad about Pitt‘s
Board of Trustees. Given the fiscal
realities of the situation. they have
no choice but to raise tuition.

Or do they‘?

I think I've found a possible
solution.

I‘m no financial expert, but I have
had three weeks of Econ ll. Even I
know that a firm is not working effi-
ciently unless it is maximizing the
use of its resources. Pitt has lots of
capital goods around here that
simply aren‘t being put to optimum
use. I

For example. take Pitt's most
prominent asset—-the Cathedral of
Learning. What a great place to play
“Dungeons and Dragons"—-- for real!

Pitt could rake in some big bucks ifit
charged about $5 apiece for“D & D"
fanactics to chase each other around
the Cathedral brandishing swords
and wearing medieval garb. It could
liven up classes. too. Can you
imagine a King Arthur-type burst-
ing into Calculus class being
pursued by the Black Knight‘?

The outside of the Cathedral is
also ripe for exploitation. Its sheer
stone facades would be ideal for
rock climbers. And the Cathedral
lawn could also be put to good use.
Since Oakland has precious little
cultivatablc land, students would
surely be willing to pay for small
plots in which they could grow
garden-fresh vegetables and rare
“herbs."

What about Forbes Quadrangle,
that massive mqnument to wasted
space‘? I‘ve never figured out why a
building with so little traffic has

eight-lane halls. l’d fill up the corri-
dors with video games. Besides mak-
ing money. it’d give students
something to do between classes or
while waiting for a professor to show
up for his office hours.

No sense in restricing ourselves to
public facilities. How about those
little-known “perks” like the Chan-
cellor's residence and the university
limousine‘?

The Chancellor could rent out his
university-supplied quarters to one
of those fraternities that doesn’t
have a house. I think it would be fun
to go to Shadyside for a frat party;
that part of town is too sedate any-
way. Chancellor and Mrs. Posvar.
who, as is well-known. love to min-
gle with the students, could stay on
as houseparents and make sure no
one spills beer on the Oriental rugs.

The university limo could be

 A Punishment That Fits The Crime And Other Quirks

is

Dear Editor:

Last Thursday night around 8
p.m. l was looking out a window
onto the Schenley Quadrangle when
I saw about five or six guys bending
over and picking up trash. For some
reason it caught my attention, espe-
cially when I noticed they weren‘t
wearing the blue Pitt maintenance
shirts. nor did they have that noisy
vacuum cleaner. Besides, who would
work past 4:30 in today's world?

I searched my mind for a logical
explanation and decided that the
new Ecological Living Unit from
McCormick Hall had to be responsi-
ble. What other motivations could
college students have for doing
something so community-oriented
and helpful‘?

I guess it pays to go to the Pub on
a Thursday night, because l delight-
fully discoveredthere that true ius-

tice in America does exist.

At the Pub. some friends from
McCormick Hall asked me ifl had
seen some guys cleaning up the quad
earlier. Always having an answer, I

The story is that this suite of guys

some resident assistants.

Instead of pressing for judicial

Defending champion Rutgers
retained its team title with an
_ easy win in Saturday‘s Eastern 8
men’s cross country champion-
ships at Schenley Park.

The Scarlet Knights domi-
nated the meet, placing four
runners in the Top l0 finishers to
score 24 points and easily out-
distance runner-up West Virgi-
nia. WVU placed two entrants in
the Top l0, scoring 62 points to
barely nipping Massachusetts,
with 67 points.

Rounding out the team stand-
ings were Rhode island (87), Pitt
(140), St Bonaventure_(l88) and
Duquesne (l9l). George

Rutger’s Jim Casey, who fin-
ished second last year, took the
individual title this year beating
out last year’s champion and
teammate Tony Ezwiak, who
came in third.

For the Pitt Panthers, sopho-
more Todd Colas led the way
with a l3th—place finish, followed
by freshman Mike Boykins, who
took 25th place out of the I00
entrants.

Pitt sophomore Bill Moore-
head, one of the Panthers’
strongest hopes on the individual
competition along with Colas,

the race, according to Pitt Coach
Mel Boyd. Moorehead was rac-
ing with a bad head cold and

Boyd, who had hoped to see
Pitt finish among the top three
teams at the meet, said he was
disappointed with his team‘s
position in the standings, but
pleased with his runners’ times.

“Place-wise, the meet really
didn‘t turn out the way i
expected,” Boyd said. “Almost
everyone on our team ran a per-
sonal best (time), wejust got out-
placed.”

Boyd had hoped his team
would benefit from running the
meet on its home course. The
meet was the ‘only contest Pitt
will host this season. The
Panther team has three weeks off
before its next meet, the West

Pitt Booters Stay  
Unbeaten in Six

By MIKE ROSE‘

Pitt News Sporlswriter

Despite its own sloppy play, the
Pitt Panther soccer team managed
to preserve its undefeated record
with a l-O victory over Mercyhurst
Friday at Pitt‘s stadium.

Pitt’s Al Adelmann scored at
l4:26 in the first half for the only
goal of the game, raising Pitt’s
record to 6-0.

The Panthers outshot Mercyhurst
24-6 but only seven of the 24 shots
were on goal. Several of Pitt‘s shots
ﬂew well over the net, and some tra-
veled high enough to clear the goal-
post crossbar.

Panther Coach Leo Bemis was
not pleased with the performance of
his team.

“We were lucky to win.“admitted
Bemis. Bemis felt that his team made
too many sloppy passes and too
many errant kicks.

The Panther defense did a good
job of keeping Mercyhurst off the
scoreboard. However. instead of
controlling the ball as effectively as
they have in previous games. the
Panthers kept dumping the ball into
midfield. Mercyhurst controlled
many of the loose midfield balls. but
they were unable to do anything
with them.

Thunberg recorded his second shut

out of the year. Thunberg almost
didn‘t have to bother showing up for
the game——— he only had to make two
saves. Despite the win, Bemis felt
that his team made too many mental
errors.

“We just did not think well out
there tonight.“ Bemis said.

Bemis explained that part of the
reason for the errant Panther kicks
was the team’s lack ofshooting prac-
tice on the Pitt Stadium artificial
turf. The Panthers normally practice
on a grass field. and the ball takes off
higher on the artificial turf than it
does on the grass.

Bemis praised the Mercyhurst
team play and said that Mercyhurst
was just a Couple players away from
having it good team.

‘Train ’aLong Time Coming

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Sports Editor
Things have never come easily for

.,Pitt fullback" Wayne “Train"

DiBartola. -

After scoring a robust 780 on his
college boards. DiBartola visited his
high school counselor during his
senior year for a career discussion.

“He sat me down and said, ‘OK.
Wayne. do you want to be a fireman.
a policeman or a garbageman?‘ "
DiBartola recalled. “l told him l
wanted to be a dentist. He laughed at
me.”

 This fall. DiBartola began his first
term in Pitt’s School of Dental Med-
icine.

When he arrived at Pitt five years
ago. the 5—l l. 2l8—pound DiBartola
wasn’t given much chance ofmaking

‘iehere as a fullback either. despite

DiBartola was labeled too slow,
too steady and too lacking for any-
thing but a spot on the Panther scout
team for two years. The coaches
doubted his running ability so much.
that they even tried switching him to
defensive for a year. against DiBar-
tola’s wishes. _

This fall. DiBartola is the Panth-
er’s starting fullback.

“That’s why statistics don‘t mean
anything." DiBartola said and
grinned. well aware ofthe irony ofit
all. “It doesn’t matter if people say
you can’t do something. l really
believe you can get almost anything
if you want it bad enough. lt'sjust
how much you want it.”

He wasn’t always so sure. After

 

those first two years at Pitt, spent
mostly mocking other teams’ plays
and “getting beat up every day in
practice” by the likes of Randy Hol-
loway. Al Chesley and Hugh Green,
DiBartola began to reconsider how
much he wanted to play football.

“I don’t even like to think or talk

about those first two years,” DiBar-
tola admited. “You’re it when you
come-out of high school. and here,
you become nothing real fast. There
was a point in my athletic careerl
thought of giving it up."

At first, DiBartola just didn’t fit
into the Pitt offense. The Panthers

still ran the Veer in l977. and the

coaches placed a premium on run’-
ning backs with blazing speed. not a
'tough. grind-it-out runner like

This year‘s Lady Panther team is-

“We had two running back posi-

ﬂtions then. and they could ﬂop the
players to either side." DiBartola
said. “Out of I4 backs. no matter
which way you ﬂopped them. I was
the l4th.“

In his first two years. DiBartola
spent a full season on the scout team
and one season as a non-medical
redshirt (the fall he was switched to
defense). Every summer-, DiBartola
worked to improve his speed and
strength. and every fall he came into
camp faster and stronger. And every

. . year. he still didn’t play.

 -“I said, ‘What am I doingthis for?‘
“ DiBartola said. “I never thought
I’d get a chance to play here. It was
really hard to keep going."

DiBartola finally got his chance in
fall camp in 1979 when several Pitt
fullbacks went down with injuries.

“It was a lot of luck,“ DiBartola
said. "Igot the chance and did pretty
well. The coaches got some confi-
dence in me. notjust asa blocker but
as a runner. too."

“He just kept plugging away,"
said Pitt Coach Jackie Sherrill.
“When he came here. we thought he
wouldn’t be a fullback. but a line-
backer. But he kept working at it."

Q P It seems the work is finally paying
off for DiBartola.

Since coming to Pitt. he’s gone
from bench pressing 280 pounds to
425. and he now runs a 4.6 in the
40-yard dash. In limited playing
time last year behind Randy McMil-
Ian. and as a starterthis year, DiBar-
tola has Pitt's two longest runs from
scrimmage since the days of Tony

‘Train’ a Long Time Coming, But On Track NOW  

Wayne DiBartola

DiBartola’s longest run was a 47-

yard burst two Saturdays ago
against Cincinnati. Plays like that
finally have the Pitt coaches noticing
him.

“I think that (his) experience
shows. and I think he‘s got confi-
dence." said Pitt assistant coach Joe
Daniels. “He’s runningthe ballquite
well. he‘s catching the ball. he‘s
blocking. Hejust does a lotofthings
very well.”

“He’s not the biggest fullback, but
he’s got size, strength and he‘s very
durable," Sherrill noted. “He‘s
consistent.”

In the vernacular of sports. “con-
sistent ” or “steady” is often just a
kind word for a player that lacks
great athletic ability or flashy style.
DiBartola, however. considers the
ta a comliment.

get enjoyment out of averaging 4
yards a carry." DiBartola said. “Its
very important for me to be consist-
ent. I want to do well on every play."

A few years ago. DiBartola would
have never thought of lining up
every play. Now in his first season as
a starter. DiBartola admits the role

result I didn't miss many blocks, and
I made some good runs.”

It's taken five years. and DiBar-
tola has finally accomplished what
many people thought he’d never
achieve. He admits it's been quite a
turn around.

“At first. all I ever wanted to do
was participate. I didn’t care if I got
into the game and just carried the
ball once," DiBartola said.

“I wouldn‘t want to go through it
again. but I think those first few
vears really made me a better foot-

ball player. I was going up against
some of the best."

Against Cincinnati, DiBartola
was the best running back on the
field. rushing for a game-high 75
yards on just seven carries.

"I've gone from nothing to every-
thing I ever wanted to be,” DiBar-
tola said. “I’m starting fullback for
Pitt. and I‘m in dental school.“

Just in time‘?
“Yeah." DiBartola smiled. “Just
in time."
