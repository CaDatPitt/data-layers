Presidents Advise

‘Rushing season is admitted. to be
a strenuous experience for the
rushees. A great many. freshmen
are overwhelmed by the large num-
ber of parties being held for them.
It is to these coeds that 'uppercla‘s-s
women, who have had ‘experience in
rushing and fraternities, offer. ad-
vice.“ ‘

‘Louise Copeland, president of 
Interfraternity -Presidents’ Council,
commenting upon the pr_esent~rush-
ing says, “I. believe that the pres-
ent rule of having a shorter rush-
ing season is -wise, since it is less
strenuous for both rushee and fra-
ternity women. However, it seems
to me that the, fraternity women
can get to know rushees better when
there is no rushing with men. Af-
ter all, we can notice the girls in
their attitude towards men at
school every day, and there is the
danger of girls goingﬁto affairs in

It is winter 1787. A layer of snow
blankets the frontier settlement of
Pittsburgh. A few log cabins clus-
tered-around the juncture of the
Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny
rivers mark this farthest outpost of
the newly freed colonies, just recov-
ering from the horrors and terrors,

of the War of Independence. Ten?

young men trudge through the snow,
bound for a little log but near the
center of the village. These young
men constitute the initial enrollment
of the Pittsburgh Academy, later to
be known as the University of Pitts-
burgh, which has just received its
charter from the state legislature.

For 143 years the date of the
granting of this charter has been
marked by the annual Charter Day
Banquet, tendered by the board of
trustees of the University to the
members of the administration and
faculty. .,

hundred members of the faculty and
administration are expected to at-‘
tend the banquet, according to Miss
Mildred E. Smith, secretary to the
Chancellor. A six-piece orchestra

Bell Rush, Mabel King, Will Rhodes,
Raymond Griffin, and Earl Mitchell,
accompanist, will render musical se-
lections at ‘various times through-'
out the evening. - .

Professor John W. Hallock, head
of the department of industrial en-
gineering, will offer the invocation.
“In the Beginning” will be the title
of the address to be delivered by Dr.
John W. Oliver, head of the —histo-iiy
department. Dr. Samuel B. Linhart,
University secretary, will speak on
“The Critical Period.” Chancellor
John G. Bowman will conclude the

Cathedral Masonry
Superintendent Dies

  
  

in

 

 

Mr. John Luke, superintendent of
masonry for the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, died last Tuesday morning at
9:20 o’clocki‘n the Homeopathic Hos-
pital. Except for a period of about
six. weeks which he -spent in New
York working on Stone and Web-
ster’s new building in that city, Mr.
Luke had been in charge of the set-
ting of the stone on the Cathedral
of Learning since this work began
in October, 1929.

His keen interest in the progress
of construction on the Cathedral,
and his pride in doing an excellent
job had much to do with the fact
that the stonework on the Cathedral
of Learning is of such a high qual-

y.

Mr. Luke was a native of Dor-
chester, Mass. He began his career
as a brick mason, but became a
master in setting stone also. His
death is mourned by all of his fel-
low workers and engineers on the
Cathedral job.

Town Registration
Figures Total 3,370

Registration in the schools of the
downtown division‘ during 1930 ‘ran
to a total of 3,370 students, a ﬁg-

bcr for the year 1929, according to
a report from the office of the
downtown registrar.

The school of business adminis-
tration comes first with a registra-
tion of 1,049 students; the school
of education second, with 880; the
college third, with 567; the gradu-
ate school fourth, with 533, and the
school of engineering last, with 341‘.

Eight hundred school teachers,
taking an average of four credits
each in liberal art, business admin-
istration, and educational subjects,
are registered in the downtown di-
vision. Four hundred forty of these
teachers come from the Pittsburgh
public schools.

Because of the increase in regis-
tration, 20 classrooms are now
in use by downtown students.

p-"t pieces of glass purchased

green rabbit which lay hunched up
on an arrow-shaped base.

A perfume burner of milky white
oipaque glass was the work of La-
lque, of Paris. This was acum-
mercial art piece and therefore was
not an original. The desi repre-
sented several mermaids w ose long
tresses were intertwined at the
mouth of the burner and whose
tails were interwoven at the base.

Rub Glass Vase

An origins _ ruby glass vase by
Lenooy of Leerdam was the only
piece of Dutch glass which Dr. Sil-
verman brought back this trip. On
the exteri-or of the vase is a metal-
lic mottling which had been applied
to the glass while it was yet hot so
that it has become part of the
glass. .

As a climax, Dr. Silverman
brought out a tall narrow-necked
ﬂask, the work of Galle of Paris.

The beauty of the piece cannot
be described in words. The design
represents a grasshopper and sev-
eral small butterﬂies in among the
curly tendrils of a vine. The most
wonderful thing though was the
fact that the design was not etched
on the glass by the a plication of
acid, but that it stood n relief.

Old French Candlesticks

To end his display of French art,
Dr. Silverman had brought 9. . air
of old French Icandlesticks. ey
were more than a century old and
unfortunately the artist who made
‘them is unknown. He had taken
several pieces of glass, dipped them
in different colors, ‘and then fired
them so that the colors ran togeth-
er and gave the appearance of mul-
ticolored tapestry. Around this he
built his candlesticks of transparent
glass.

Dr. Silverman has worked hard in
an effort to collect representative
pieces of art in glass, and those
which he has acquired this summer
are worthy to stand on the shelves
with his other pieces.

the order to meet new men rather
than to get acquainted with the fra-
ternity women.”

Another officer of the Interim-
ternity Presidents’ Council, Dorothy

Rohland, advises rushees to go to
as many parties as possible in or-
der to -make up her mind which
group she wants to join most satis-
actorily. ‘‘I believe a longer, less
intensive period of rushing would
allow rushees and fraternity wom-
en to know each other better,” she
added.

Margaret Hall, president of the
Women’s Self Government Associa-
tion, says of rushing, ‘Rushing is 9.
strenuous time for both fraternity
girls and rushees—-a time to keep
your head and be yourself to the
best of your ability. Many who are
being rushed will consider seriously
joining a fraternity. In your choice
of that group of girls with whom
you will join your loyalty, ‘be sure
that you consider more than sur-
face impressions. There is a loyalty
and a kindness among friends that
is more vital to you as a prospec-

rial well-being.” ,

One of the questions in the minds
of rjushees is “Will joining a fra-
ternity prevent me from making
other friends? Will -it limit my as-
sociations to just one circle of
friends? The answer to this ques-
tion made by fraternity resident's
council is that while join ng 9. fra-
ternity gives a ‘close relationship
with one group, it does not hinder
fraternity r s from cultivating
other frien ships or keeping the
friendships they had before they
joined.

‘Fraternity women in general ad-
vise rushees to give serious thought
to the fraternity they join, since it
is as permanent relationship. In con-
sidering which fraternity to join,
rushees should take in consideration
the type of girl she is, and the type
gin girls in the fraternity she may

a_ report by Sarah Drum, Panhel1e-
mc president, and Mildred Levinson,
who attended the National Panhel-
lenic convention at Northwestern
University last week-end.

. According to the national organ-
izations, the only drawback to the
association at Pitt is that the women
fail to see the lack of logic in rush-
ing for wor_nen’é fraternities with
men. Practically all major college
groups have discarded this practice,
although anreffort to do so here was
a point’ of contention at Panhellenic

likely that -results of this rushing

Uniontown Dramatic

Club -Presents Play

Uniontown Center.--“God Winks,”
a one~act play by Katharine Bur-
lgess, was presented by the Union-
town Center Dramatic Club, at a
Zgudent assembly, Friday, February

 

The theme of the play centered
about the eccentric Mr. Gower’s
great admiration for George Wash-
ington. Gower was played by George
Tanner, president of the clu . Miss
Esther Cox was the loyal Iris serv-
vant girl.“ Others were Miss Emily
Dixson and Mr. Lee Smith.

The play was directed by Mr. J.
R. Hilty of the English department,
faculty adyiser.

.Mr. Kappler, assistant business
manager of The Owl and business
manager of the Pitt Weekly, spoke
to the Assembly on the importance
of keeping in touch with campus ac-
tivities through the Owl. A com-
mittee, headed by Mr. James Div-
vens, has been ‘appointed to " take
subscriptions for the Owl at the
Uniontown Center.

Keep To Classes

In regard to the policy, the Uni-
versity should follow in times of
business depression, their opinion
Was that as many as possible of the
students should be kept in the class-
room. and by so doing the Univer-
sity would leave positions for em-
ployment open to the public. The
administration has followed up this
idea b making. a special block
schedule for the students who were
not sent out on co-operative work
this semester. These students were
allowed to register at the summer
term tuition of one hundred dollars.

Because other schools have more
co-operative work than Pitt, the Uni-
versity wanted industries’ opinion
about the addition of an alternate
five-year co-operative course with
the additional year being devoted to
co-operative work. The committee
felt that the present plan of the
University was doing so well that
they did not feel this step was nec-
essary. This question is, however,
not settled and will be further dis-
cussed next year at their annual
meeting. '

To Send Reports

Another question stimulating con-
siderable debate from the members
of the committee. was whether a
regular report of the activities of
the co-operative department for the
vanious co-operating industries was

of each semester--for the co-open
ating employers. This report will
contain discussions of questions of
interest to industry and the admin-
istration. .
Besides making reports to their
employers, the students are required
to submit to the University twice a
month a report of their work that
must be signed by their employer.
This idea of having the ‘employer
sign the student’: reports was
started last year and has not only
stimulated more of the employer's
interest in the co~opera2tive student
but also made the reports better
and more timely awarding to Mr

nan. Bad Man mg  
The little Dog “Scat”

It all happened at the corner of
Fifth avenue and the Boulevard last
lwednesday afternoon about three
‘o'clock. A group of rain-soaked stu-
dents was boarding a crowded Fifth
avenue car. Enter the mut.’ , "

He was a perky pooch, small, wiry
and faintly whitish. The long 
on his feet and under-body dripped
with coal-black water. He mi ht
have been clean that morning, ut
he had been having a whale of ..a
good time. He saw the car and the
students came over to -investigate
and suddenly decided to go traveling.’
To think was to act, and he was in
the‘ car. . ‘ ‘

Then the fun began. If you stood
not more than a foot ‘from the ﬂoor,
ima 'ne with what unholy glee you
would wriggle your muddy little
bodyin and out, among the forest of
legs in a crowded street car. Think
of the un-alloyed pleasure of hidi g
under a seat while a fat and irate
motorman lost time, temper, and the
respect of all who dislike profanity,
searching for you. Every time he
stooped to clutch at your ﬂeeting
tail, he bumped into innocent women
and children. He beg-gedin accents
which would make strong men,
Weep, that you be a nice doggie and
a pretty poochie and get the (you
know what) off this car

Meanwhile outside
light changed from red to green and
back to red again. The cars lined’
up behind and spawked. But the
hunt was going merrily on in the
forest of legs. ‘

Finally nigrod bagged his game
and dumped the culprit into the
street. He slammed the doors, jitg};
gled the, bell and started off, wi
the face of an athlete who has just
ﬁnished a ﬁve-mile run.

But the pooch-—-well, he looked

and vfeliired it for its trill to Pitt.
Transplanted from its original en-
vironment near Mercer, the 50-
yeer-old elm will be one of ‘four
which will chaperon the put of
majestic clips that shade the side’-
walk along Bigelovr Boulevard, in
front of the Cathedral.

This was among the ‘present-day

 " Purpose of Schooling

“To realize the social value from
“educatiocn is the true purpose»; of,
schooling?’ Thomas told ‘hls audi-

lof ‘the fact that their — institution,
whether it be _a. private school, a
state uiiiversity or a “partly eI.1d0V;V¢d
institution, has been made possible
only because of the toil an.d~reiforts-
of others, many who-In themselves
are not ableto experience tthe ad-
vantages of schooling,” he -added.
Thomas sees the ptesﬁnt day 85
the close. of an epoch because there

Speaking in the ﬁfth of a -series
of lectures by- facu‘lty.members, Dr.
Otto E. Jennings, head of the de-
partment of botany, gave a talk on
“Presque Isle” Wednesday after-
noon at -Mellon Institute. ‘.

Presque Isle‘ is of particular in-
terest to the University, for last
spring, the State Park and Harbor
Commission erected = a laboratory.
there for the use of the botany and
zoology departments. , P V 

Dr. Jennings first described the
location of Presque Isle. This land
is reall‘ a peninsula about six miles
long w _i~ch extends into Lake Erie
about four milesfwest of Erie. It.
is composed of sand and swamp ma-

terials, and has been built upby the»,

waves washing the shore 'west of
Erie, carrying_ the ‘materials to the
eastern end of the Isle, and forming
land at the rate of about a half
mile a century. , g « \j
“Prosque Isle _is . probably the
smallest area in the United States
‘containing such a.‘ complete series

of plant successions coupled. with a ;

variety of’ plant habitats.” Dr. J en-
nings claimed. He went on to ex-
lain that as the land‘ which has
eon added to the peninsula gets
older, its composition and vegeta-
tion undergo changes.’ I
 Jen""ngs cited" a series of
plantsuccessions as the reason the
lake laboratory is being established
at- Presque Isle, since it is well
suited for educational purposes.

Party Wanted

‘ : Inquiry Speaker Advocates

Change In System

In one of the most interesting and
emphatic ‘sessions of the ‘Inquiry
Club, Mr. Howard Y. Williams, sec-
retary of the League for_Independ-
ent Political Action, tore into the
present political alignment and cited
‘the necessity and probable accom-
plishments of a new political. party.

Speaking’ before a rather small
group. Mr. Williams was particular-
y effective and threw his challenge
into the audience with forcefulness.

Want Five-Year Plans

“The, Republican and Democratic
partiesof today,” said Mr. Williams,
“have. the same groups, the same
ideals and the same political’ phi-
losophy. Their. philosophy of govern-
ment is rugged individualism. The
:1 philosophy of government is the

hi osophy‘ of planning and control.
, e have to have ﬁve-year plans, and
we have to plan from a distant point
of view." . - . _ 

.Mr. Williams. then continued to
cite of the control of the national
resources, the public utilities, and

hands of a small powerful minority.
“There’s no hope for the small busi-

 ness man in the modern schemeof

'thin.gs,” he continued. “It’s a tragic
situation. The-southernetextile work-
ers are revolting. I’ »

tion,-“too.  , The present Republican
administration has done nothing, in

tress ‘of the present .depression_.
Eventually, planned politics will
step into the line. And the great

tive tariff.”r I ~ ; ,,
“We -could lead the world into

Pessimistic Views
p ORMAN THOMAS speaking at Assembly
 ' this week, painted the modern world with

dark gray strokes of the master pessimist.
"Poverty of the present day exceeds that of
 previous generation.
"‘The present ‘epoch has no standards.
';"‘[A great scale war is imminent.
’ "Signs of the age show that it is not strong,
 ealthy and robu_st.”‘
' I; ~:"~I‘hese are some of the somber phrases that
indicate the gloomy context of r. Thomas’ ad-
rfess. Probably fewmen have had the oppor-
‘tiinities to study economic problems so close at
 as has Mr. Thomas, and in order to make
‘their evils signiﬁcant to others, he has been
(‘compelled to“ paint them with an exaggerated
touch. ,
~".,?j,;iBut did Mr. Thomas offer. much in the line
‘e__f—j_constructive argument? Did he indicate any
ay in which students may help the situation
= cept in the same abstract terms that com-
‘eniencement speakers and valedictorians usually
claim as their own? '
j.,._‘ Although there is poverty and overproduc-
‘rtiyon in the world today, surely Mr. Thomas
would not exchange places with the laborers
 serfs of the 17th and 18th‘ centuries. That
égthe.‘ present age has no standards may be a
 thing. Surely it leaves itself free to adopt
any means that will help in improving the con-
dition. of its people. '
 Scientiﬁc accomplishments of the -past few
years, the increase in educational facilities, and
the development of cultural appreciation [indi-
cate that the world has lost little of its strength
orhealth. The same factors of science, com-
reercialism and education which Mr. Thomas
».  would ‘produce another war, can also pre-
'-‘7ii{e9nt that war.

Noted Men At

Thomas, Wilson Speak On
Socialism, Unemployment

More than 200 students assembled
to hear Norman Thomas and J. Stitt
Wilson in a student forum held last
Tuesday in Alumni Hall. Thomas
had addressed the students earlier
in the day at an assembly in Me-
morial Hall.

The two speakers were introduced
by B. H. Williams, professor of polit-
ical science, and were limited to ten
minutes each. At the end of this
time an open forum was held in
which the students could question
both Thomas and Wilson.

Ten Minute Talks .
Mr. Thomas, handicapped by the
short time allotted him, spoke in
“chapter headings," as he called
them. The speaker outlined three
main points for the students, the
ﬁrst of which was the necessity of
a new “socialistic philosophy.” The
second point was the necessity of
thinking and reﬂecting the new phi-
losophy, and the third, the organi-
zation of it. ,

mayor of Berkley, and -‘lecturer in
universities for the past twelve

conditions in Pittsburgh as intoler-
able. The speaker strongly advised
the students to come in personal con-
tact with these conditions in order
to really feel them. He advised the‘
students to read books and pam-
phlets which were unprejudiced and
describe the conditions as they are.
Many Questioned '
Lively interest was shown in the
open forum by the questions asked
by the students.‘ Asked to describe
the main difference between social-
ism and communism, Thomas replied
that the differences deal primarily
with their method. He described so-'
cialism as dealing less with collec-
tiveness than communism.

the present economic crisis, Mr.
Thomas said: “The crisis is due to
Wall Street Mania. The soundest
thing to have been done until some
feasible plan could be worked out
would have been to issue more than
a billion dollars worth of Liberty
bonds for the construction of public
works.” ' . ‘ '

‘Jones Explains Modern Language Experiments

By WALTER B. JONES;
Research Professor of Education
In a. preceding article, it was

stated that at present the chief pur-
pose of placement tests in most in-
stitutions is prediction of general

success in college. This article
gives an account of an experiment
being conducted in the Modern

Language Department of the Uni-
versity and explains the use of
placement tests for measurement of
a freshman’s present knowledge of
a subject and classiﬁcation and as-
signment to courses on this baszs.
This means registering a student
for French III because his present
lcnowlbdge of French makes it pos-
sible for him to do the work, not
because he already has spent two
years sitting in French. classes and
' just “getting by.”

Modern language placement tests
in -French, German and Spanish
were ﬁrst given to the freshmen en-
tering in the fall of 1928, but stu-
dents were placed as usual, at this
time, according to the number of se-
‘mesters of work taken in high
school. A careful follow-up study
was made of the success of these
students and their semester grades
were compared with their placement
test scores.

This study was continued through
the fall of 1929-30, placement tests
being ‘given and the test scores com-
pared with semester grades. On the
basis of the ﬁndings, we now know

in.

 

i7s';.r"’...'."PITT POURRI

what grade 9. student is likely to re-
ceive in a given class when we know
the score he has made on the test
taken before registration‘. For ex-
ample, it was found that all stu-
dents who made test scores below a
certain point received failing grades
from their instructors in French
III during the trial period of a year
and a half. Whatever the reason
for failure, French II or perhaps
French I should have been their
placement.

On the basis of the results of this
year and a half of experiment, Dr.
J. F. L. Raschen, Head of the De-
partment of Modern Languages, in
collaboration with the members of
his department, agreed to try plac-
ing stu'dents according to the place-
ment test scores. Dr. Raschen and
Professor W. ’H. Shelton have
worked closely with our division in
perfecting the plan.

' Re-classify Frosh

The ﬁrst group thus placed was
the mid-year freshman class of
1930. Provision was made for these
freshmen to take the test before
registration. Tests were scored and
the class assignments made from
the test scores. These assignments
were placed in the hands of the ad-
visers at registration and the stu-
dents were registered in accordance
with these assignments. This means
that some were placed in more ad-
vanced and others in less advanced
classes than they would have been
if placed, as formerly, according to

The following poem from the Sun-
Dial is worthy of reprint: _
The speckled trout lays lot of eggs
The Plymouth Rock lays one
And does a lot of cackling
When all her work is done.

The trout’s a very silent ﬁsh

And we pay her no attention

But the hen who lays a single egg
Gets honorable mention.

We scorn the industrious little fish

Which simply goes to show you
It pays to advertise.

the number of high school semester
credits which they had accumulated
in the subject.

The first group was not large, but
the comparatively small number of
failures among students thus placed
led the department to try the same
method of placement with the stu-
dents entering in the fall (1930).

. Few Failures

At present we have available for
this group, placed last fall by place-
ment test scores, grades given by
the instructors for the. second,
fourth and eighth weeks and also
the ﬁnal semester grades. The re-
sults are almost unbelievable. Of
those who took the tests, not a stu-
dent failed out of 91 for whom ﬁnal
grades are available Only four
D's were given! While the percent-
age of F's for all classes in the Uni-
versity ‘is 5 per cent, and for D's,
16 per pent. In the main, two fac-
tors seém to ‘be responsible for the
success of the plan. . First, the
grouping of students with like
achievement, and, second, the su-
perior teaching which this has
helped to make possible.

At the end of the ﬁrst eight weeks
only two placement adjustments
were made. Two students were
transferred from Spanish III to
Spanish II. Having had two years
of Spanish in high school, they had
been given the beneﬁt of the doubt
and placed in Spanish III in col-
lege, although their test scores
hardly warranted such a position. It
was seldom necessary to place a stu-
dent more than one year‘-lower than
his high school. years warranted.

In marked contrast to the two

cases mentioned above, there were
three students, with only one year
of Spanish in high school who were
placed in Spanish III because of
high test scores. At the end “of
eight weeks, the grades of these stu-
dents were B, A and A respective-
ly and B,'A and A respectively at
the end of the semester._

Similarly, students having had
only one year of French in high
school have been placed in French
II, III, IV and V in college, cer-
tainly with some degree of success
since no failing grades are reported
and only six of the forty-seven stu-
dents who took the test in French
had grades as low as D at the eight-
weeks period and only three re-
ceived D's as ﬁnal grades in the
ﬁrst semester.

No doubt you will concede the
soundness of the principle underly-
ing this attempt to place students
according to the quality of perform-
ance and the degree of achievement
which has been attained.
reasonable to, "suppose that the
quality of work to be expected ‘from
a student can be determined better
by a measure _of his present knowl-
edge of a subject than by the num-
ber of semesters or years he has
spent in courses in that subject. If
the tests are adequate measures of
achievement, this procedure should
place the student in the class which
offers work best suited to his stage
<8 advancement and abilities, thus
resulting in a. happier adjustment.
The decrease in number, of failures
means a great saving of time rind
increase in -satisfaction and self—_re'-
spect for all concerned.

J. Stitt iWiIso‘n Addresses
  Student Issues Confabe

The Y. M._and Y. .W. C. A..,_“Stu-
dent and Social Issues” Conference
proved highlyinteresting and stim-
ulating, under the leadership of J.
Stitt Wilson, former Socialist
mayor. of Berkeley, Calif. Wilson
has aided Ramsay MacDonald,
Prime Minister of England, to or-
ganize the Labor Party in England.

Wilson, who is on his way home
after leading a similar conference at
Yale, spoke on the changing order
of our‘ institutions. Starting ' with
early man, he showed how our insti-
tutions have developed through two
streams, one, “Man’s humanity to
man,” ‘which is ever-growing wider,
and the other, “Man’s inhumanity to
man,” which is ever growing nar-
rower.

The conference opened on Sunday,
February 22, wtih Miss Margaret
Rodgers, Col. '32, presiding. Wil-
son's opening address, “The Signiﬁ-
cance of our Social Problems,’-’ was
followed by student presentations of
our social problems. S. Clayton
Newman, Col. '31, presented the
problem of “Unemployment”; Louis
White, graduate, that of “Race”;

.Miss Sarah Beatty, of Carnegie

Tech, told of “International Rela-
tions,” and Miss‘ Josephine Her-

mid, of P. C. W., that of
Family.”

Discussion groups of these prob-
lems were led by Dr. alph H.
Boots, professor of Political Sci-
ence; Mr. Moss, of the Urban
League; Dr. Benjamin H. Williams,
professor of Political Science, and
Dr. Manual C. Elmer,_ professor
and head of the department of so-
ciology, respectively. ~ ’

“The Social Contributions of 
ligion” was the subject of Mr.«Wil-
son's talk as the conference scon-
tinued on Monday. Different views
of “The Practical Application of ‘Re-
ligion” were given by. Rev. Theo-
dore Miller, speaking as a minister;
Mr. W. M. Mendenhall, as a facul-
ty member, and Charles Seidle, Col.
'31, and Margaret Rodgers, as;.stu-
dents. After an open discussion,
Mr. Wilson concluded the ,meeting
with an address on “The Technique
of Creative Living.” ' « . .

candidates are expected next week
to alleviate this condition.

Three of the boys have been par-
ticularly pleasing thus far. These
men are Harry Conte, a 115-pounder
who has had some previous experi-
ence in local amateur circles; Joe
Tommins, varsity, football player,
who has been developing fast in the

who has been showing the way to
the men in-the 145-pound division.

Sufrine Aids Coach I

Inasmuch as the coach is not al-
lowed to sit in the corner of his
ﬁghter during the course of a
match, under intercollegiate rules,
Pitt is fortunate in ‘having a former
amateur boxing champ to direct th
ﬁghters in their matches. ~

The former champ is Ben. Sufrine,
Col. ’31, who was Western Penn-
sylvania. 118-pound cham ‘on in
1925 and runner-up to the estern
Pennsylvania champion in the 125-
pound class the following year. Suf-
rine «engaged in 75 bouts during his
career, losing only ﬁve and scoring
knockout victories in twenty of
them. He boxed at Erie, Buffalo and
New York as the representative of
Pittsburgh in inter-city matches.

Aside from Sufrine, other candi-
dates forthe managership are: An-
gelo Anonizio, Bus. Ad..’32;,. Roy

Spring Grid Practice Is Still
— Month Away

 

Spring training of the football
squadis not likely to start for at
least another month, Jock Suther-
land, head football coach, stated last
week.

The practice is not expected to
last as long this year as it did in
1930. Then, a great many veterans
had graduated, and it was necessary
to work with a group made up main-
ly of inexperienced candidates. This

season, however, most of the regu- A

lars will be back, and the task of
the_ coaches will be correspondingly
easier.

Training Period Short

Dr. Sutherland said in connection

with the above, “Spring training will
last only as long as necessary. We
will not keep the candidates for the
team out for any time longer than
that in which we can get an idea of
the ability of the various players,
help get them in condition, and train
them somewhat in the fundamentals
of football.” ’ y
, Dr. Sutherland also took occasion
to state his views on over-emphasis‘
in the grid game. He was emphatic
in his, disagreement with the op-
opponents of football as it is now
P yed.

a

“I do not believe that too much
emphasis is laid on football. as so
many critics claim,” he said.
“Among other parts of the training
system, spring practice has come in
for a great

in mind that such_ practice does not
take up as much time as is common-

deal more than an hour is used, and
there are very few students who do
not waste that much time every day.

No Training Table

“Also, Pitt does not have a train-
ing table. There are scarcely any
colleges in the East of a representa-
tive size wliodo not have these.- Pitt
plays a harder schedule than almost
any university that does have ‘a
training table, and, as a result, it
is very trying to the Pitt players.

“Then, too, the Pitt team must be
ready at the very beginning of the
season for its toughest battles. For
instance, this coming season ﬁnds
Pitt playing Iowa in the second
game, of the season. Iowa is one of
the most powerful teams in the Mid-
West and, without spring practice,

chance. Yes, I would like to repeat
ll*.}iatl;:,‘;spring practice is necessary at
it . ’

The Pitt coaching staff will re-
main the same as last season. “Skip”
Gouglav, freshman coach; Ray Mont-
gomery, Joe Donchess, Andy Gustaf-
son, Hangartner, and Bill Kern will

assistants. It is interesting to note
that every one of these men is a
Pitt graduate.

Pitt Trims State
In Slow Tilt, 30-24

The Pitt Panthers scored another
victory over Penn State Saturday
night b the score of 30 to 24. The
game A
most uninteresting games witnessed
this year.-

For the ﬁrst half the Blue and
Gold merely showed a good display
of pass work, and were ‘unable to
penetrate the Staters defense. The
Blue and White. did less passing and
more shooting and at the end of the
half led 13-9.

At the start of the second half
~Pitt was rid of their sloppy streak
and led by Willie Arture started to
score and managed to stay ahead of
their opponents‘ for the rest of the
game. Penn, not giving up, started
a scoring spree that was halted by
the gun.

The outstanding man for the vis-
itors was their tall center, Fred
Brand.

From the way the members of the Athletic Departmentand students
have been coming around the ‘stadium lately to watch the members of the
‘freshman and varsi-ty boxing teams go through their paces, pugilism is
destined to become one of the most popular sports on the campus within

The reader no doubt knows that boxing, as far as Pitt was ‘concerned,
wasan unknown intercollegiate sport until the athletic officials decided ‘
to support a team at its ‘last meeting; and even before posters were
placed upon the various bulletin boards which dot the campus-, ambitious
youngsters were already working out for the glory of dear old Pitt.

-—°t—.". .. 1  , . . _ .-
He expects to halve‘ o strong'varslty next year if the present " rrosh‘
group. continues to improve at the same rate at which it has been‘ doing
at present. Pitt may have an intercollegiate champion next year. Maybe.
Football players have found boxing particularly tempting to them.
Johnny Luch, Joe Tommins, John Valenti, ‘Francis Onder all being ‘can-
didates for either the varsity or freshman group. ' ' . -

—-—o-——- ‘

And speaking of Valenti, this writer believes that the big
boy from Media, Pennsylvania, has not been receiving his just
dues from his fellow students. John is beyond doubt the most con-
scientious worker among the Pitt athletes.. '

When John ﬁi-st came tothe ‘Pitt training camp last fall for
preliminary football practice, he weighed 290 pounds. Coach Skip
Gougler told him that he would never make a Pitt
unless he lost much of his excess weight.

_' Valenti 'needed'no other warnings, and at once he began one of the
toughest assignments ever-handed, to an athlete, that of losing close’ to
odd pounds during the football season;.and in
order to keep in condition, following the close of that sport's term, he
started immediately into pi-_iming ‘himself for the track andﬁeld sport‘
in which he is a weight heav_er.- . '
J o-lin thinks that he can devote his time to both sports at present
as there are no indoor meets on theifreshman track schedule this year.
He is, downto 229 pounds at present, and despite the loss of 61 pounds
within the past seven months, John claimsthat he feels “swell.” ‘
resent program, he" may be the second
thnee numeral winner. that Pitt has had in a long time.
Alpert was the first Pitt man -in many years to accomplish this
feat when he earned numerals in football, basketball, and tennis-
-last year. Valenti has already earned his numerals in football,
and his chances for doing so -in both boxing and in track are ex-
cellent. Here’s to your _luck, John! .
Jntercollegiate boxing placesmore emphasis upon “non-
overemphasis”- than does any other collegiate sportin that the
coach is not permitted to sit in the corner of his ﬁghters during
the direction of the pug‘-is*in* the

0 . . .

Pitt need not worry about this angle, however, as Ben Sufrin, the
Weekly Managing Editor, is a former amateur champ, and he has ex-
pressed a desire to guide the boys through their bouts. If he is as suc-
cessful at ‘guiding the ﬁghters as he isat doin

g his portion of the Weekly,
the Pitt boxing team is made. A

 Range

In Sfodiaﬁzii

Mecca ForROTC Members

The “crack shots" of the R. O.‘ T.
C. and varsity riﬂe teams of the
University are enthusiastic over
their new range in the Stadium, if
their turnout to practice and
matches is any indication of that
state of mind. :

The roster of the new range quar-
ters contains the names of 146 stu-
dents, all of whom have turned out
for practice this year since the
range has been in use. This is al.-
most three times the number who
turned out last year. -

R. C. Hempel, Col. '31, who last
year as high man in the 3rd Corps
Area received a silver medal, and
who also was high man in the var-

isity matches held at Philadelphia

last spring, says of the new range:

Best In Country

‘‘I know of no other college riﬂe
range in the country that will sur-
pass ours. All the facilities are cer-
tainly of the best. complete even to
a wire and pulley system that brings
the shooter's target back to his ﬁr-
ing post without halting the ﬁre of
any other men on the range.

“The range at Drexel Institute, in
Philadelphia, is said to have cost
$17,000, and yet lacks any system
like ours for. returning the target
to the man ﬁring. The lighting sys-

adequate, which cannot be said of
the Pitt range.”

Harold Backen, Eng. '32, who last
year received a bronze medal in the
R. O. T. C. competition, and who is
a member of both the varsity and
R. O. T. C. teams of the University,
says:

“Our new range gives every man
ﬁring on the team the chance to
show himself at hisbest, for he has
none of the. obstacles to overcome
that Pitt teams have been forced to
contend with in former years.”

Old Range Inadequate
“For the past three years wehave
been ﬁring undler conditions that
made it impossible for our _men to
compete on an ‘equal basis with oth-

1 er college teams,” adds H. B- Mc-

Kinney, Jr., Eng. ’31, who, as var-

varsity squad, should know some-
thing abou-‘. the difficulties met in
completing the exhausting schedule
of the riﬂe season. “After a
heavy rain or snow storm, the old
range in the Logan Armory’ would
become flooded with water and mud.
When this. happened during the
matches. we were forced to stand

Iterm. .

“The Florist Shop,” one of tin.-
Harvard Workshop plays, is the
story of a sentimental clerk in a
florist shop who sends complimen-
tary ﬂowers to people whom she
thinks need a change in their
smooth-ﬂowing‘ lives.’ ‘When she
sends orchids to an old maid who
has been engaged for ﬁfteen years,
she plrecipitates her marriage. The
sentimental shop girl is
Sally Rodgers, Col. ’34.

The playlet was directed by
Pauline ,Bays,:Col. ’31. The other
members of the cast were: Albert
Wasel, Ed. '34, who plays the role
of the errand boy; Donald Early,
Col. ’33, the owner» of the ﬂorist
shop; Elenore Hoffman, Col. '32, the
old maid who was thrilled by the
receipt of the orchids, and Louis
Green, Col. ’32, the man who ﬁnally
married the old maid. ‘ -

Hannah Taimuty, Ed. ’32, directed
the Booth Tarkington playlet, “The
Trysting Place.” Like most of
Booth Tarkington’s works this play
has in its cast the boy who is just
growing into a man’s estate and who
is indignant because nobody will re-
alize the fact. The part of Lance-
lot was portrayed. by Herbert Lau-
terbaoh, Ed. ’32, withall. the squirm-
mgs and laugh-provoking antics
anyone could wish.

has given during the

’32. .

There were only three players in
the third play, “Red Carnations.”
This play was written by Glenn
Hughes and was directed by Robert
hleeb, Col. '31.

“Red Carnations” tells the story
of a certain Miss Smith (Virginia
Wickersham, Ed. ’31) who meets the
one and only one at a fancy dress
ball. She asks him to meet her in

t--'1 of the Drexel range is also in-‘

sitymanager and a member of the_

on boxes and unstable planks while
ﬁring.”

The construction of the range was
supervised by Jack Farley, Univer-
sity carpenter, who is an expert
marksman and who knew just what
the needs of the riflemen ‘would be.
It was he who installed the wire tar-
get-retrieving device.

Targets Lighted

The interior of the ﬁring quar-
ters is lighted by three neon lights
that glow dully, giving off just
enough light to ena‘.le the occupants
to see after they have become accus-
tomed to the semi-darkness. Each
man’s target is lighted by a power-
ful ﬂoodlight that may be focused
for intensity to suit the rifleman.
Ten of these lights have been in-
stalled, an‘ are set in a concrete
base facing the line of targets. A
concrete walk has also been laid be-
fore the targets and leading back
to the ﬁring room.

. The University a p p r o p riated
$1,500 for the building of the range
in the beginning, and it is estimated
that the actual cost probably ran
in excessof $2,000, not including’. Of
course, the labor of the University
carpenters who worked on the job.

Members of the Carnegie ’ Tech
riﬂe team, who last Saturday de-
feated the Pitt men in a shoulder to
shoulder match held at the Stadium
range, expressed their approval of
the range. Frederick Beckert, cap-
tain of -the Tech team said:

“I am highly pleased wtih the new
Pitt range. It is certainly much bet-
ter than the $17,000 range at Drexel,
over which we ﬁred last year. I do
think, however, that the Pitt scores
could be improved if the stadium
windows were blackened.”

W. J. Hagenlocher, assistant man-
ager of the Plaid riﬂemen, also ap-
proved the range, saying: .

“I».think the Pitt.ﬂood-light sys-
tem provides especially good _-il.1u-
mination of the targets, but I must
add that the side-glare-' from the win-
dows prevents taking full advantage
of the ﬁn-e lights. The range is a
little crowded, for shoulder-to+shoul-
der competition, but is one of the
ﬁnest ranges the Tech team has ever
ﬁred on.” ,

Lieutenant F. E. Cothran, 
riﬂe team coach, sums it all up with
these words: ' ‘ ’ ‘ I _“ 

“I would like to congratulate the
University of Pittsburghupon their
splendid new range. It 1s_a wonder-
ful improvement over the madequate
Pitt facilities of last year.”

This mortal discovered a nifty wrist-

instrumental in returning it to the

worried and left it there on purpose
so that he could ﬁnd the honest man
and split his fortune without much

. For Social Problems

On the topic of social problems
which are’ confronting students, the
program committee of Y. W. C. A.
has planned two successive Monday

March 9.

Monday, March 2, Mr. Harold Lett
from the Urban League, an organi-
zation for the promotion of better
racial understanding, will speak on
the subject of “Missionaries of Mis-
understanding.” The inter-racial
committee, headed by Aleeth Rob-
erts, Col. ’32, and Alma Robinson,
Ed. ’31, is in charge of this session.

“Demobilizing War” will be dis-

Registration Increases F o r
Two-Weeks Period

The 1931 pre-two-weeks summer
session has been planned with great
care according to Frank W. Shock-
ley, director of the University ex-
tension and summer session. Each
year more students are taking ad-

vantage of this short summer ses-

sion. he says.

In 1927 the first special session of
intensive courses was inaugurated
as a regular feature of the summer
session program. The enrollment
was 4:35 for this first pre-two-weeks
session. In 1928 the enrollment in-
creased to 562. In 1929, 705 students
enrolled, and last year there were
693 registrations. '

The largest group in the first and
second short sessions was the school
of education with 206 students in
1927 and 228 students in 1928. Grad-
uate students comprised the largest
group in 1929 and 1930 with 241 and
275 students.

Pittspikers Arebetennmitedi
To Break Mountaineer Jinx I

Pitt’s varsity track team, riddled‘well balanced. Mickey Brand, dis-
by the ineligibility of some of itsltance man; Callaway, hurdler, and

most noted performers, will attempt
to break the jinx held over them by
the Mountaineer spikers when they
face the latter tonight in ‘Morgan-

town in the third annual indoor

meet between the two rivals.

West Virginia defeated the Pan-
thers in the two previous indoor
duels and from the form shown by
the representatives of both schools
at the Mountaineers’ annual invita-
l’.l0Il meet at Morgantown two weeks
ago, the Mountaineers should have
little difﬁculty in making it three in
a row tonight.

most prominent of these men and
Pitt will depend upon him in the

are expected to pick up points for
Pitt. Watkins will run in the half
and in the mile, while Luch will toss
the weights along with Carver.
West Virginia has few outstand-
ing men, the team as a whole being

Hill, weightman, however, have been

press-agented a little more than
their fellow runners, jumpers and
tossers and they are ﬁgured upon to
lead the Mountaineers to victory

place the regulars_ when they tire,
or are injured or are oﬁ’ form; and
Tech will be considerably weaker
tonight than it was the last time
out. due to the breaking up of its
regular combination.

Captain George Rease, high scor-
er on the Tech teams of the past
two years; Ed Stentz. sophomore
center from Clairton; Jimmy Fer-
gus, sophomore guard and backbone
of the Carnegie offense and defense,
and Jimmy Leonard, diminutive
guard. are the ‘four men who start

regularly for the Tartans who will
be in the lineup tonight.

Regular Injured

Logan Webster, :1 regular on last
§’8a1"S team, Whohas not been see-
1_ng. much action this year due to in-
juries and to the brilliance o’ the
sophomore candidat will likely re-
place Smith.

Pitt will be an the top of its form
for this game. The improved form
shown by co-captain Eddie Baker in
the Penn State game last Saturd‘v
was most gratifying to Pitt support-
ers; and since Eddie is equally
adept at either center or at guard,
Pitt will be stronger in two posi-
tions.

In the last meeting. Tech surprised
Coach Carlson’s lads with a zone
defense built especially to stop the

Pitt offensive system. Pitt was un- ~

prepared for such an emergency, but
tonight will probably find them
drilled in an offense for either the
zone or the man to man defense.’
Pitt’s lineup for the game is un-
certain due to Carlson's habit of

shifting his starters around con-A

stantly.
