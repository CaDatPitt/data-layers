VQLUME XCVIH, NUMBER 119

War veterans, gang  
members help writer

LUCY LEITNER
Staff Writer

Maxine Hong Kingston, who has been
credited with opening doors to a generation of
Chinese writers, said her mother “squeezed
the stories out of [her]” by  her out of
windows to sing to her grandfathers as a child

On Monday night, Hong Kingston gave
an ho11r-and-a-half lecture in the Carnegie
Music Hall. ,_

Hong Kingston is noted as the writer of .
“The Woman Warrior” (1976) and “China
Men” (1980), and has an upcoming release,
titled, “The Fifth Book of Peace.”

The petite, 63—year-old Chinese-
American woman stood behind a podium on
a nearly vacant stage as she recounted her
development as a  ‘ '.

She spoke of the Chinese “ta]k—stories”
that passed through generations, and of their
inﬂuence on her writing. She said she ﬁrst
became a writer after she learned the alphabet I
and received her ﬁrst library card, which gave
her “identiﬁcation as a reader.”

Named as a  jewel of Hawaii” by I

a Buddhist sect in Honolulu, Hong Kingston
is acclaimed for integrating memoir, ﬁction
and mythology into her semi-autobiographi-
cal accounts of Chinese immigrant heritage in
the Unﬁed States. i '

Born during World War II, she “inherited

questions about war” and asked, “What can
_ one individual person do about it?” 1
She began writing "Ihe Fourth Book of .

Peace” as her own addition to the elusive
Chinese “Three Books of Peace” her mother
had told her about as a child

But after a ﬁre destroyed her home and
writing in 1991, she could not continue, she
said.

“I lost my ability to read. I lost my ability ’

to write ﬁction, [because] ﬁction is a compas-
sionate fonn,” she said ’

“I regressed. I became a child,” she
explained of her attempts to work in isolation.

Hong Kingston invited veterans from dif-
ferent wars and their families to form a “writ-
ing community” permeated with Buddhist
“cornpassionate listening” activities. More
than 200 people, ranging from WWII and
Gulf War veterans to ex-Vietcong and gang
members, took part in the community.

“When we feel stuck and can’t write, just
breathe and the inspiration will come,” Hong
Kingston declared. ‘

The members of the community engaged
in breathing exercises, as well as eating and
walking meditation. For therapeutic purposes,
Hong Kingston rang the Buddhist “bell of
mindfulness” to initiate silence when they
were not listening to each other’s stories. She

In his bright orange tie, Toker
holds back while on TV show

Toker, page 1

Recently, Toker advanced further
toward a legacy of his own. Appearing on C-
SPAN 2’s “Book TV,” he discussed his work,
“Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright,
E.J. Kaufrnarm, and America’s Most
Extraordinary House.”

Wearing a bright orange tie, Toker told
the tale of a past-prime architect, a merchant
magnate in a city of industrialists and the
house that would forever link them.

Toker later described himself as more
“straight arrow” on the show than he nor-
mally is. “I don’t usually hold to the script,”
he said.

Back in the office, he pulled out a work-

ing copy of his book, putting it on an awk- I

wardly large wooden desk
“I didn’t know the totality of it all,”
Toker said about his days before research.

He dropped under his desk to unplug a cof— '

fee pot. ~

The jacket of his book called his work
an 18-year etfort. He described that as “true
and not true.” -

In 1985, Toker accepted an olfer to
speak on Fallingwater, but other projects

I kept his attention divided

N 0 one should work on only one project
at a time for an extended period of time,
according to Toker.

“God help you if you are,” he said

In 1998, Toker kicked into high gear
after he’d seen Fallingwater cut open to have

‘ its cantilevers repaired a year earlier.

“It takes a lot of ego,” he said, “to make
that step.”

If Toker has an ego, it wasn’t born
overnight. -

At age 11, he- showed an interest in art
history and amazed his parents by recalling
a slew of impressionist painters’ names from
an exhibit he visited with his aunt.

At 16, he discovered architectural histo-
ry while “angling for a summer job as a tour
guide” in his native country.

Toker, who speaks English, French,
Italian, German and Hebrew, was born in
Montreal, Canada. He graduated from
McGill University at the age of 19, before
earning degrees at Oberlin College and
Harvard University.

A man once chastised for refusing bour-
bon from a museum director, Toker keeps a
Diet Coke in his fridge.

That’s not all.

“I’m never without sneakers, sus-
penders and tie andjacket when I teach, or
any other time except when I’m working
out,” he said

Toker married an American he met in
Italy. He now has three children.

He also holds the distinction of being
“the ﬁrst non-Italian to teach art history at the
University of Florence,” according to his
resume.

An expert on early Clnistian architec-

ture and a Pitt faculty member for more than
20 years, Toker’s latest work fhI'llSt him into
the forefront of Fallingwater authorities.

But not to be confused with the monu-
ments, relics and artifacts he studies, Toker
asserted his technological evolution.

He hasn’t used conventional slides
since 1997 and, what’s more, Toker commu-
nicated extensively through e—mail during
the production. of his most recent work

“I never met my publisher, editor or
agent until the book came out,” Toker
declared with a smile.

Authors arrested in the capital

Hong Kingston, page 1

described the organization as a writing
workshop, and not a cult

After the healing sessions, Hong
Kingston was still at a loss for an ending to
“The Fifth Book of Peace,” so she waited for
inspiration.

“I could allow myself to just receive
gifts from the muses,” she said, adding that
her plan was successful.

The soft—spoken, white—haired woman
proceeded to recount her trip to Washington,
D.C., where she read her poetry for
International Women’s Day last March.

She and other female authors, including
the not—exactly-incendiary Mormon nature

writer Terry Tempest Williams, were arrest-
ed for throwing things at the White House.
According to Hong Kingston, the police in
the U.S. capital were ‘Very nice,” even in
their application of handcuffs.

At this point, the older members of the
audience applauded like she was a standup
comic.

Following her lecture, inquisitive audi-
ence members asked Hong Kingston an
array of questions, mostly unrelated to her
writing. Some inquiries targeted her
thoughts on Ralph Nader, the possibility that
the wrath of her ancestors was responsible
for the ﬁre that destroyed her home, and how
to host a peaceful candlelit vigil for the
National Riﬂe Association.

Economy, Clinton administration and

SVO, page 1

clinics open in various locations
throughout Pittsburgh to help the home-
less with medical, dental and mental ill-
ness, and substance-abuse issues. There
are also specialty pediatric and obstetri-
cian-gynecologist clinics open.

Locations for these services include
women’s shelters in‘ the city, Family
Links and various Salvation Army loca-
tions.

Many families are homeless or
starving because they simply cannot
make ends meet, Williams said.

“The living wage in our country is
horrendous,” she added.

For someone working‘ at minimum
Wage —— $5.15 an hour — to afford the
average two—bedroom apartment in
Pittsburgh, he would have to work 152
hours a week, she said. At this rate,
some families have to take two or three
jobs just to barely support themselves.

The welfare reform under former

“President Bill Clinton’s administration

is also partly responsible for the amount
of homeless people in the nation,
Williams said.

Previously, people were allowed to
stay on welfare for anlindeﬁnite period
of time. But in 1996, that program was
replaced with Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families, which put a cap on the
amount of time spent on welfare, limit-
ing it to five years.

But after people are “pushed” off of
welfare, they still don’t have the skills
necessary to gain employment that pays
above minimum wage, Williams said.

Other factors contributing to the
problem include economic downturns
and decreasing employment, domestic
abuse, a lack of affordable housing, the
closing of Section 8 Housing Voucher
waiting lists, mental illnesses and sub-
stance abuse.

“It’s rare for me to see a patient that '

doesn’t have some kind of mental ill-
ness or substance abuse,” Williams
said, clarifying that substance abuse
problems could include people on pre-
scription drugs. Mental illness does not
mean- necessarily “crazy” or schizo-
phrenic, either, she said. It could be
psychological problems caused by
abuse or violence. _
Health Care forthe Homeless also
administers a ‘lot of HIV testing because

many homeless women have resorted to '

prostitution for money, Williams said.
The Allegheny County Department of
Human Services works with Health
Carefor the Homeless as well as other
organizations so that the homeless pop-
ulation can get “hooked up to the
resources available to them,” Venezia
said.

The -Department of Human
Services refers homeless clients to she]-
ters or transitional housing, as Well as
health care and food resources.

During the winter months, the

- department tries to get what Venezia

calls the “chronic homeless” into shel-
ters.

Once temperatures drop below 20
degrees, or there are severe Weather
storms or blizzards, the Allegheny
County Severe Weather Emergency
Shelter opens. ‘' —

But often, the “chronic homeless,”

those that are on the streets for a long.

period of time Without going to shelters,
will not go to shelters,
Some people do not like to go

because they do not like to follow the‘ V
- rules, they suffer from a mental illness

or they had a previous bad experience
in a shelter, Venezia said.‘

Mercy Hospital’s Operation Safety
Net tries to persuade the homeless liv-

ing under bridges or in cars to go to »

these emergency shelters during the
winter.
Thanks to these emergency shelters

and outreach programs, there has not

been a case of a homeless person freez-
ing to death during the Winter months in
10 years, Venezia said.

Once the chronic homeless popula-
tion is in these shelters, the Department
of Human Services tries to get them as
many services as they can, educating
them about food, health care and transi-
tional housing resources. ‘

-The Greater Pittsburgh Community
Food Bank provides a great deal of this
food. Most of the food comes from
donations from food drives, local food
manufacturers, retailers, farmers or
wholesalers. The "food is then redistrib-
uted to local food pantries, soup
kitchens or shelters.

Both Health Care for the Homeless
and the food bank are looking for vol-
unteers to help counteract the issues of
hunger and homelessness in Pittsburgh.

Separating church and state to excess

Paying lip service to the separa-
tion of church and state, and as a nod
to states’ rights, the Supreme Court is
allowing states to deny scholarships
to students studying theology.

The ruling, which was handed
down on Wednesday, was precipitated
by the case of Joshua Davey, a former

‘undergraduate student in Washington.

Davey had won a state scholarship,
but had it taken from him when the
state learned that he was studying to
be a minister,'citing the separation of
church and state. The Court ruled 7-2
that the state was within its rights to
do so.

This case, however, is not one of
states’ rights, and it isn’t about the
separation of church and state. This
case is an example of the Court allow-
ing a state to discriminate against a
student, and to make it even harder

g for Americans to get educations. ’

True separation of church and
state, true adherence to the letter and

spirit of the First Amendment —i

which states that “Congress shall
make no law respecting an establish-
ment of religion,” — would mean that
states be required to extend scholar-
ship opportunities to all students.

Separating church and state means

not embracing one religion over
another, not that the state must avoid
all things relating to spirituality.
Funding one student’s ‘study of

Christianity is not discrimination, so
long as another student’s study of
Shintoism has the same chance of
being funded, and the religion or
belief system in question isn’t a deter-
mining factor. _

Where will states draw the line?
Will a state decide not to extend
scholar_ships to those students who
would study psychology or philoso-
phy? Sometimes those pursuits tread
close to religion, and often, under-
grads in those majors go on to semi-
nary. What about women’s studies or
Africana studies? States may decide

not to fund subversive curricula

because they could be perceived as a
threat to the status quo. The potential
for abuse by individual states under
this “ruling is tremendous._

Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, writing -for the majority,
wrote, “...majoring. in devotional the’-
ology is akin to.a religious calling.”
Who is the Court. to make such a call?
At the undergraduate level, it’s nearly
impossible to tell where a student will
run with such a degree. Some English
majors go on to seminary — should
their chances at scholarships be elim-
inated?

No one illustrates this uncertainty
better that Davey himself. After fin-
ishing his degree in theology — with-
out the scholarship he’d won —, he
went on to law school. _

you voted against the USA Cl-IILDRENS

dren’s safety? Or are you a baby—hatin ,
latte-drinking, sushi-eating, anti-American
Nazi?” I can see it now; a glorious existence
with replacement kids who are brought up
on a steady diet of Bill Cosby, “Care Bears”
and abstinence. A land where bad means
bad,goodmeansgreat,and“phat”isstill
gibberish. Plus, we could use the discarded
youth’s collective energy to power
California . Matrix-pod-person-Style:
BOOM! No more energy 

Obviously, the movement will have its
detractors. But we progressives will surely
know that their hatred is simply conﬁrma-
tion of our true path, that they are just wacko,
radical-right conservatives who feed oﬁ°
stagnation. We see tomorrow, and we don’t
like it. We will make tomorrow safe for our
children — well, safe for us.

What a delicious, frosty bottle of c1assy,imported urine

I was partying.
I was intoxicated.
It was a weekend, and I was just having some
fun with some of my friends. I set my beer down
while I went to the pisser. I was only
gone for a moment. I never thought
what happened could happen to me. I
icked up my beer, put it to my lips,

' took a sip, and blacked out. _

Only for a moment, though. I came

that had entered my mouth. Somebody

. had pissed in my beer. Scanning the
room, I realized who the culprit had to
be. I was about to chuck the piss bot-
tle at him when I realized that would
be a mistake. Nobody had pissed in
my beer. The bottle in my hand wasn’t
mine. It was a Molson.

Somebody had picked up my Busch and left‘

me with their Canadian schlong water. While
somebody was off wondering how his or ‘her beer
had magically become such a great—tasting beer, I
did my duty to beer, and gulped down the remain-
der of the Molson. It crossed. my ‘mind several
times to throw it out. The only reason.I didn’t was
because I remembered my mother’s words from
my childhood: “There are sober people in Canada
‘ that would love to have that beer.”

Assuming my mother was right, my question
is: why don’t they just keep that crap in Canada?
The answer is simple: Americans are stupid
enough to purchase Canadian beer for a lot more
than it’s worth. They think that drinking an

 

Christian Brubaker
Columnist

imported beer is classy, and they believe this to
the extent that they will drink something that
probably tastes better on its way up than on its
way down. I’ll bet I could jerk off a goat into bot-
tles, label it as an imported beer, and
nobody would know the difference.
Someone once told me that beer is
beer. That’s a seemingly obvious state-

ment is more complicated — and dead
wrong. Of course beer is beer, but this
statement suggests that beyond your
beverage being classified as a beer,

ters. It’s as wrong as saying a blowjob
is a blowjob — accurate at first glance,
but what if she bites?

In other words, beer -is to Canadian
beer as a blowjob is to having your dick clamped
down on so hard that the teeth marks linger for

weeks. I could go on with classy analogies, but I V

believe my main point is understood.

At this point, some people must be wondering
why I care so much. It’s not that -my tongue that
has to endure Hell in order for me to get drunk.
Well, I care for ‘two reasons. My friends are
falling victim to‘Canadian beer, and it pains me to
see them ignore high-quality American beers such
as - Busch, Coors Original", Iron City, and
American. Also, I know that right now, some-
where in Canada, some smart-ass Mounties are
cracking jokes about how stupid Americans are
for drinking their urine. There’s nothing lower
than being the butt of a Canadian’s joke.

ment, but the implication of the state- '

nothing else about your beverage mat- I

Truthfully, figuring out a solution is going to
be much more difficult than just. recognizing this
problem. As simple-minded Americans, commer-
cials such as a bear singing karaoke with a few
Asian men has somehow brainwashed us into
believing that Labatt Blue is good. Creative label-
ing has helped .Mo1son grab the attention of
American beer drinkers. People read labels like
“This is my 10th beer and you’re still ugly,” and
forget about the nasty ﬂavor. I, too, am amazed
that the beer often says what everyone else'is
thinking, — but it’s just not worth the ﬂavor.

I can only come up with a few ways for
American beers to compete with the brainwashing
techniques of the Canadians. First, we need a
return of the Bud Bowl. Sure, it steals the spot-
lightfrom football teams, but nobody cares about
teams like the Panthers and Patriots anyway. We
need American beers to play American football
every winter. e

Second, American beers other than’ Coors
Light need to develop some catchy jingles. The
wingman song was perhaps the ;best jingle ever. —
unfortunately, Coors Light is almost as bad as a
Canadian beer.

Most importantly, we all need to pick up our
drinking of American beers. It is in cans of

American beer that we will discover great taste," ,

and the ultimate truth of drinking: Canadian beer
sucks.

gram for sober Canadians. Contact him if you’re

I retired to my room, where I

sympathy to show toward the

heard behind me.

I rested on what I deemed to be
my minimal responsibilities as a
decent person. When she went back

' to her bed, I asked if she was all

right, if she needed anything. She
said that she’d be fine, and I headed
to the kitchen to make breakfast. In
the kitchen, I soon realized that all
the pots and pans and various other
types of kitchenware had disap-
peared. Back in Maggie’s room, I
asked if I was no longer allowed to
use her pots and pans. She said that
they were hers and that she was
tired of me leaving them in the sink.
I announced that she was crazy,

away the eggs I had broken.

Experiments in improvisational love

ASHLEY MCGUIRE
Assistant A&E Editor

Editor’s Note: This installment of A

The Pitt News Blind Date Contest ran
into an unforeseeable hitch. After first
contacting the female entrant, the A&E
editors couldn ’t ﬁnd the male half to the
Blind Date equation. Reasons for this

included: Not being able to get in touch”

with the first choice after numerous
calls and e-mails; other winners claim-
ing their entry forms were as a joke by
their friends; an entrant saying he had
other plans; and two entries proving,
frankly, unbelievably frightening.

As a result of this unprecedented
turn of events — and to be fair to the
spirit of the contest and the one person
who could actually be reached — the
A&E editor stepped in for the guys who
didn’t want to, or were unable to, go.

A cynic about love. A bubbly gal not
worried about finding her prince ... yet.
These two descriptions could only mean
one thing — the time has come for
another round of the Blind Date Contest.

What do you do when the male con-
testants for the blind date to see Robert
Schimmel at the Improv turn out to be
fake, have a scheduling conﬂict, are

unable to be reached or are sim-
ply a joke? You get A&E Editor
Dante A. Ciampaglia to be a
good sport and go on the date
himself.

On the evening of
Valentine’s Day, junior Becki
Shucosky arrived with a gleam-
ing smile on her face and an
Incredible Hulk valentine in her
hand for herxdate. While the cir-
cumstances with the men were
explained to her before the two
left for the Improv, Shucosky
was not offended‘;

. “Obviously, they don’t
know me. If theyldid, all the
guys would have wanted to go
out with me,” Shucbsky said.

While she may have
seemed forward intthe begin-
ning of the date, Shucosky is
merely someone who knows
what she wants in life, a quality
that seemed to be ‘the major
similarity betweenl her and
Ciampaglia. Another is that
both have their fingers in the
communications pie. Ciampaglia works

, for The Pitt News, and Shucosky works

for WPTS.

However, when S ucosky spoke of

her dream to work as a coroner, her
bluntness stunned us all —— I would not
have expected the sweet brunette to
work with dead people. But then again,
no one expected me to some-
how have stayed silent for
several consecutive minutes
on a date. D

But that’s exactly what
my date —— Sports Editor Joe
Marchilena — and‘I did. We
stayed quiet in Ciampaglia’s
back seat, making sure to
soak in every word of their
conversation.

“Reporters should fol-
low me around all the time to
record my hilariousness,”
Shucosky said.

Meanwhile, I happened
to look out my back seat win-
dow to observe deer having
sex. Not only was I tail—dating
on someone else’s date, but I
also had to watch two deer
make sweet love. I want to
say there was a third deer in
the mix, but I’m not sure. But
they must have known what

they were just doing the nasty

to give the opening comedian some
material, seeing how he mentioned the
same occurrence in his act.

When we arrived at the Improv, the
four of us were treated to an exquisite
dinner that was topped off with choco-
late mousse cups for dessert. The con-
versation was lively. There was always
laughter — especially when Schimmel
told a joke about body parts and birth-
day cake —— and only a few awkward
silences. \

The night turned more serious after
the comedy show ended, though, and
the four of us went back to unwind at
my place. The conversation turned into
questioning how each felt about rela-
tionships. Always a good sign — at least
better than the signs I’ve gotten on any
date I’ve been on before.

Though there may have been a few
sparks, Ciampaglia and Shucosky never
spoon-fed each other their chocolate
mousse. But they didn’t throw it at each
other, either. Another good sign.

By 2 a.m., tiredness set in, and
phone numbers were exchanged. And
although there was no lip action
involved with the blind date couple, we
can all rest assured that at least the deer
got some.

2003 was characterized by an unsatis-
fying array of ﬁlms. It started outwith the
J erry O’Conne1l disaster “Kangaroo J ac ,”
only to slip into a summer that lazily
churned out sequel after sequel, including
“Bad Boys 2,” ‘“Charlie’s Angels: Full
Throttle”, and the forgettable “Legally
Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde.”

. However, by year’s end, the movie theaters
managed to salvage a few worthwhile
gems, some unexpected and some deﬁnite-
ly anticipated to bust box—ofﬁce records.

5. “Freddy vs. Jason"

This was a diamond in the rough of
bad summer movies. Although it sounds
ridiculous, the concept of a battle between
two American horror—ﬁlrn icons produced
a movie that was a surprisingly entertain-
ing blend of humor and gore. Between the
hilarious one—liners and bloody, cringe-
inducing killing scenes, the newest edition
of many slasher sequels is a true guilty
pleasure; Add the climactic ﬁght scene, and
you have a movie that -would make any
horror fan giddy.

4. “X2: X—Men United” '

It is a rare occurrence when a sequel is
better than the original movie. Not only
does this second installment in the “X-
Men” series packa bigger punch with fast-
paced action sequences, but it also intro-
duces a new cast of kick-ass characters,
including Alan Cumming as the transport-
ing Nightcrawler. Fans should look for-
ward to the third installment, which is due
in the summer of 2006. Hopefully, it will
keep up the good work.

3. “Lost in Translation”

This ﬁlm from director Sophia
Coppola is a dry, witty story about an
unlikely friendship between two
Americans in the midst of chaotic Japan.
Coppo1a’s depictionqof ﬂie loneliness of
ﬂiese two characters is superb, and, with

this ﬁlm, she ﬁnally proves herselfgas more

than just Francis Fordfs daughter. The act-

ing is also impressive, especially from Bill A

Murray, who deserves the Academy Award
for his performance as a washed up-actor
forced to make ends meet by appearing in
commercials for Japanese whiskey.

Men’s ice hockey falls to Edinboro in postseason

Edinboro forward Nick Tucci single-
handedly knocked Pitt’s Division III hock-
ey team out of the College Hockey East
playoffs.

Tucci notched three goals to give the
Fighting Scots a 6-2 win over Pitt on
Friday night. Forward Chris Morgan
assisted on all three of 'I‘ucci’s goals.

After Ignas Marcinkevicius and Jon
Colarusso each scored a goal to give the
Panthers a 2-0 ' lead, Tucci scored
Edinboro’s ﬁrst goal when he controlled a
loose puck near a Panther defender, skated
towards the net and shot through the ﬁve-
hole of Pitt goaltender Colin McCloskey.
The goal came at 15:35 in the ﬁrst period.

Edinboro forward Mike Yaskulski and
Morgan both scored second-period goals
to give the Fighting Scots their ﬁrst lead 3-
2.

Colarusso committed a roughing
penalty with ﬁve seconds remaining in the
second period —-— a penalty that would
carry over to the final period.

In the third period, with 1:35 remain-
ing on the Colarusso penalty, Pitt defense-
man Justin Avi received a penalty for trip-
ping. ,
Edinboro did not waste the opportuni-
ty to put the Panthers away with the ﬁve-
on-three power play. K

Forward Owen Bates took a pass from

Morgan and ﬁred the puck on net.
McCloskey dove to make the save, but
could not handle the rebound. Tucci swept
in to send the puck into the open net.

A minute later, Edinboro scored again
on the power play to take a 5-2 lead. Bates
controlled a rebound and shot it past
McCloskey. S

Tucci would seal the game at the 7:13
mark on a breakaway. He moved toward
the net, causing McCloskey to commit,
and lifted the puck high, stick side, for his
third goal. '

Head coach Toki Barron said he was
disappointed to lose after opening the
game with a 2-0 lead. He attributed the let-

Men’s lacrosse picks up ﬁrst win of sea-
son '

It was an abnormal move by Panther
attackman Warren Maxwell that propelled
the Pitt men’s lacrosse team to. a victory
over No. 22 Michigan State.‘

Maxwell scored ﬁve goals and record-
ed three assists in the Panthers’ (1-0 over-
all, 1-0 Central College Lacrosse
Association) 13-11 win over the Spartans
(1-2, 0-1). His sweeping move across the
ﬂat part of the cage led to most of his goals.

“It’s a move that many people don’t

have the courage to take,” Pitt head coach
Rob Heaps said.

Sweeping in from the side of the net is
dangerous because sticks are ﬂailing and

the player must run through at least one or .

two defensemen to reach the net Heaps
commented on the cuts and bruises that
Maxwell sulfered just to get to the net, but
accredited his goals to his speed and abili-

/ .
“His ﬁve goals are more than out-.

standing against a strong [Michigan State]
defense,” Heaps said.

-The key moment in the game came
with the score tied at nine in the fourth
quarter. Both teams had taken several turns
at holding the lead, and the Panthers Vlady
Tinchev, with the Spartan defense
stretched out of position, drove down the
left side. Tinchev was one-on-one with
Spartan goaltender Ryan Doski and ﬁred a
shot to the right-hand side, beating Doski
for his second‘ goal of the game and the
eventual game-winner.

Junior midﬁelder Craig Anderson,
who scored the game’s ﬁrst goal, ﬁnished
with ‘two goals and an assist for the
Panthers. ; .

. On the other side, two Spartans ﬁn-
ished with a hat trick. Brian Baines and
Grant Grifﬁth both notched three goals in

p the game-

The Panthers will play against another
CCLA team on Friday at 9 p.m. for their
home opener. The game is against Buﬁalo

. at the Cost Center.

loss against the Temple Owls.
'IheOwls scoredtworunsinthe
top of the ﬁrst inning, thanks to doubles
by left ﬁelder Lynsey Grace and catch-
er Alexis Gary. Pitt responded in the
bottom of the ﬁrst when DiMaria, who
ﬁnished the day with two triples, scored
on a third base error by Lauren Evans.
Bostick gave up sixihits and four
earned runs in four innings of work,
earning her third loss of the weekend.

Pitt4,RhodeIsland2

After a roller-coaster weekend,-

Bostick left Greco Field triumphantly,
pitching her ﬁrst career complete game
and leading the Panthers to a 4-2 victo-
ry over Rhode Island.

Rhode Island started off quickly
against the Panthers for the second
straight day, as it jumped out to a 1-0
lead in the second inning. But the

Panthers responded, scoring two runs

in the third inning.

Pitt will travel to Houston, Tex., to
take on Mississippi State at 3 p.m. on
Friday as part of the Hyatt Regency

good,” Barnett said “She was awful. You know
what guys do? They respect your ability. You can
be 90 years old, but if you can go-out and play,
they’ll respect you. Katie was not only a girl, she
was terrible. OK? There’s no other way to say it.”
I can think of about a hundred other ways to

say it.

-Legal experts are predicting that the impact _of
the ruling in the Maurice. Clarett case will be
short-lived. —
'Ihetheoryisthat,onceClarettisinthe
NFL, his legal team will not ﬁght the appeal.
Therefore, the NFL will win, and the league’s

policy on draft eligibility will be reinstated

But does that theory really make sense?

If U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin felt
that the NFL rule prohibiting players from enter-
ing the draft until they are three years removed
from high school violated antitrust laws, who is
to say another judge wo11ld not feel the same
way? «
If a player like Clarett, who is far from being-
a model citizen, found a way to win in court, I’d.
say the chances of another judge ruling the same
way are pretty high.

Evangelista leads Pitt to win over New Orleans, but Panthers can’tcomp1ete sweep

Baseball, page 11

I-Iiser’s ﬁrst start after sitting out all of last
year due to an injury.

“He was very ﬁred up to pitch.
Obviously, by the numbers, he did a fantas-
tic jo ,” said Jordano.

T.J. Gomati earned his ﬁrst victory for
Pitt by tossing four relief innings of one-hit
baseball.

Pitt 9, New Orleans 3

In the second game of the series, Pitt
rode the arm of senior pitcher Nick
Evangelista and the bat of Hiser to a 9-3 vic-

tory over the Privateers.

Evangelista threw seven shutout
innings, allowing only three hits and striking
out six. Hiser hit two home runs as the des-
ignated hitter and had a garne-high three hits
and three RBIs.

“Nick did a great job,” said Jordano.
“When you don’t walk people and you’re
making plays behind him, good things are
going to happen.”

Pitfs offense jumped on New Orleans’
starting pitcher Michael Jones early, scoring
threerunsinthetopoftheﬁrstinningtotake
a quick 3-0 lead.

Inthe top ofthe fourth, Hiserhithis ﬁrst

of two home runs down the left-ﬁeld line to
give Pitt the 4-0 lead

Cashman added two hits in the game
and was on base when Hiser launched his
second home run.

‘New. Orleansv10, Pitt 3

Pitt failed to complete the sweep of
New Orleans when it broke down in the sev-
enth inning to lose the game by a ﬁnal score
of 10-3.

Parise delivered a home nm for Pitt in '

the ﬁrst inning to give the Panthers the early

‘ lead, but it was not enough; they fell behind

heading into the seventh

 famiula far in

 

In the top of the seventh, Pitt catcher
Mike Zambriczki drove inlthe tying run with

a sacriﬁce ﬂy. However, in the bottom of the '

seventh, New Orleans’ offense produced six
runs to bust the tight game wide open.

VV1th the series win, Pitt improves their
record to 2-1 in the early season, while New
Orleans drops to 4-5. Pitt will travel again
this weekend to take on the Duke Blue
Devils.

“Being an ACC school, [Duke] is
always going to be good regardless of where

they ﬁnish,” said Jordano. “lWe’re going to

play hard baseball and see what happens in
the three games.”
