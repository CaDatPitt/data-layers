Public hearing set
on faculty unionization

By Michele Rhodes
The Pitt News

7 In the first of a series of conferences,
Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board offi-
cials met Monday with representatives of
Pitt’s United Faculty and the university
administration to establish a schedule for
the initial phase of hearings on the issue of
faculty unionization.

Public hearings will begin on May 16 and
continue through June 8 at the Pennsylvania
State Office Building. 300 Liberty Avenue,
downtown, according to United Faculty
president Philip Wion. He said both sides
agreed to two and a half weeks of hearings.
No hearings are scheduled for the week of
May 27.

United Faculty, formed in 1982 and affil-
iated with the American Association of Uni-
versity Professors and the American Federa-
tion of Teachers, seeks to bargain collec-
tively for Pitt faculty members. The
university administration opposes this

"effort, saying that collective bargaining is-

not in the best interests ofthe university or
the faculty.
PLRB hearing officer Elliot Newman pre-

sided at Monday’s conference. In addition to -

the hearing schedule, a hearing structure was
established. That structure involves laying
ground rules for the order in which specific
issues will be addressed during the hearings.

“The parties will now confer amongst

‘I don ’t think anyone is
going to be happy with what
they get.’

—- Ronald Talarico

themselves in additional meetings prior to
the hearings," Newman said, adding that
these conferences will identify areas of
agreement between United Faculty and the
administration. lssues to which both sides

agree will not be raised at the hearings, New-.

man said, in an effort to streamline the
proceedings.

Newman divided the process into two
phases. During the first phase of hearings, to
begin on May l6, the issue of defining the
appropriate bargaining unit(s) will be
addressed. A second phase of conferences
and hearings could begin as soon as
October, according to Wion.

That phase would focus on whether Pitt
faculty members are legally considered man-
agers, supervisors or simply workers. The
status of part-time faculty and non—teaching
professionals will also be determined at this
time, Wion said.

SGB denies request

Showcase gives another perspective on how

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

Hand-in-Hand representatives
defended their budget requests at last night's
Student Government Board meeting, but
funding for festival extras like eating uten-
sils, clown suits and thank-you cards was
denied.

Hand—in—Hand spokesman Susy Camp-
tezi argued that the group's annual Hand-in-
Hand Festival is sponsored by many
Pittsburgh businesses and should, therefore,
be run professionally.

“We invite all the corporations [that spon-
sor the festival], and we want them to come
see that this is not some Mickey Mouse oper-
ation,” Camptezi said.

Funding requests were denied because

SGB bylaws do not allow funding for food
and beverages, and plastic silverware is seen
as falling into this category.
. The board also voted down the request of
$200 for l,000 thank-you cards. It found the
request unreasonable since the festival was
allocated l0 reams of letterhead on which
thank-you letters could be written, Alloca-
tions Chairman Steve Smith said.

Page 19

After the board’s decison, Camptezi said
the group had actually cut down the number
of festival programs.

“We cut our programs down from l,250 to
600," she said. “I think it’s really worth it."
The group will accept the board’s
decision. '

Although the board reviewed over one
dozen other budget requests, only the Pitt
Ski Club was present to contest a funding
denial ~ but its members were too late.

Board president Ken Stram apologized to
the group, explaining he had thought their
budget would be reviewed at this meeting
when, actually, it had been reviewed last
week. “l’m sorry, -but the board has already
made its decision,” Stram said.

The board denied the club a refund of
$1,700 used for lodging at Killington, Vt.
The club will have to place emergency

requests for the money instead, Stram said. V

The denial of the club’s request will cost
members who attend $40 dollars more per
person. The decision will be countered with
an emergency request.

Ski Club president Torn Brizes said the

club has been budgeted for the trip for the _ V

last eight years and always got it.

Nurses welcome computer age,
hold technological conference

By Cheryl Slrko
The Pitt News

Participants demonstrated the
newest [in computer technology at
yesterday's nurses’ conference
entitled, “Pacesetters in the Compu-
ter Age of Nursing.”

The conference, sponsored by the
Mid—Atlantic Regional Nursing
Association (MARNA) of which
Pitt's School of Nursing is a charter
agency member, featured speakers
including Nancy O‘Donohue, RN,
MA, a leading software consultant
for nursing services who has been
integrating computers and nursing
since the late l960s. - '

The trend of ‘computer use for
nurses has been fairly recent,
MARNA executive director Jacque-

iiiii

line Rose Hott, RN, said.

Among the many computers was
one that understands nursing duties.
The Inter-Active Video Disk is a

' new computer that “talks" to nurses

while they’re working and is capable
of evaluating their work, Hott
explained.

The same disk can also be con-
nected to a CPR doll to instruct a
nurse while she learns cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation.

Personal computers such as the
Touch Screen Computer, produced
by Hewlitt-Packard, have uses
inside the university, according to
company spokesman Carl Stevens.

“The nurse is able to interact with
the screen. She can use it for her
notes in school," Stevens said.

“Its also been implemented in the

Pittsburgh hospitals since January
Ist of this year. A nurse can ask it
questions about a patient, for exam-
ple, and the information comes right
to the computer...saving a lot of
time.“ He said another advantage of
the computer is that it can also show
pictures and diagrams, which can
often be an aid to people in the
health professions.

The conference, while discussing
technological advances in research
and nursing, concentrated on show-
ing nurses how to use computer pro-
grams as an aid in nursing
administration issues while recog-
nizing the limitations of
microcomputers.

MARNA, active in nursing edu-
cation and services, is active in New
York, New Jersey. Pennsylvania,
Delaware and the District of Colum-
bia, according to Hott.

Students get moneys’ worth

Service does ‘healthy’ business

By Nancy Popkin
The Pitt News

Pitt students are privileged, at
least when it concerns health care.

The Student Health Service,
located in Brackenridge and Forbes
Halls, serves only students.

The student health fee is the sole
funding of the Student Health Ser-
vice. lt is mandatory for all full-time
graduate, full-time undergraduate
and full-time professional students.

Last August, Dr. Pamela Bowen,
medical administrator in charge of
clinical services, said she received
calls from parents complaining
about the $30 health care fee added
to their children’s bills.

“I‘ve gotten my $30 worth out of
their gynecology service,“ senior
Lisa Lowi said.

Under the Student Affairs divi-
sion of the university, the fee comes
up for review every two years, but
the review for this year was deferred
upon the direction of Dr. Franklin
Carter. The possibility ofan increase
in the fee has been postponed until
next September.

Polish prof

blasts (1.8.
policies

By Michele Rhodes
The Pitt News

Relations between the United
States and Poland are now undergo-
ing “the deepest crisis in [their] his-
tory." Polish professor Longin
Pastusiak said in a lecture last night
in Forbes Quadrangle.

“The subjective policies of the

present [U.S.] administration, spe-
cifically its reaction to the martial
law December, l98l" have created
the crisis, according to Pastusiak, a
visiting professor at Ohio State Uni-
versity and specialist U.S.-Polish
relations.
. The economic and political sanc-
tions adopted by the Reagan
Administration against Poland in
the wake of martial law were clear
violations of multilateral and bilat-
eral treaties and agreements, accord-
ing to Pastusiak. t

U.S. sanctions against Poland
included the denial of agricultural
credits to purchase livestock feed
and seed grains and the suspension
of most-favored-nation status, fish-
ing rights in American waters and
landing rights in American airports.

While critical of the Reagan
Administration for making Poland
a “pawn" in superpower politics

between the U.S. and the Soviet‘

Union, Pastusiak maintained an
optimistic long-term view.

Pastusiak said the positive factors
that traditionally shaped U.S.-
Polish relations are still in existence
and have not been damaged by cur-
rent U .S. policy. “I can see the objec-
tive factors being revived." he said.

When asked about the current
administration‘s policy toward
Poland, Pastusiak said, “There is no
policy with this administration." He
said it is only a side aspect ofa larger
policy directed primarily at the
Soviet Union.

Reagan did not relax the restric-
tions sufficiently after martial law
was lifted in July 1983, according to
Pastusiak. He said that landing
rights have been restored for only 80
charter flights per year and that this
was done primarily as a. response to
pressure from U.S. tourists. While
limited access to U.S. fishing waters
was restored recently, it is restricted

to I00 thousand tons annually, 50‘,

percent of which must be purchased,"
according to Pastusiak.

The traditionally warm relations
between the two countries resulted
from a number of related factors,
said Pastusiak. These include the
large Polish-American community
in this country, mutual economic
and cultural interests and the

absence of armed conflict between’

“ the two countries.

Most of the money collected from
the fees is used to pay salaries. The
rest is split down the middle t'or/clini-
cal and educational services.

Treatment for minor injuries and
illness make up the clinical half of
the service.

These programs “aren‘t too excit- -
ing unless you‘re sick,“ Carter said.

But for many students who keep
late hours and do not eat right, they
may be sick more often than when
they lived at home. Bowen said.

One common flu virus that the
service treats is influenza-A. its
symptoms are high fever, sore
throat, coughs and aches. The diag-
nosis of the virus is made with a
throat culture. Bowen explained.

The throat is swabbed, and the
tissue collected is used to grow the
virus in a lab.

The health service is one of the
three sites in Allegheny County
where influenza is cultured, Bowen
said.

The health service also boasts its
successful gynecology clinic. With
approximately 4,000 visits a year.
the clinic, located in Forbes dormi-
tory, sees one-tenth of all of the Stu-
dent Health Service visits, Carter

said.

“I use the gynecology service, but
ldon‘t like the nurse practitioners in
the main clinic because they think
they can play God,“ Pitt senior
Annie Sedonic said.

“The nurse practitioners in Brack-
enridge have given me‘ incorrect
diagnoses,” Lowi said.

Bowen disagreed. She said that
students have a mind set that they
have to see a doctor. They have a
misconception about nurse practi-
tioners, she said. Nurse practitioners
are qualified to treat upper respira-
tory, gastro-intestinal and viral
symptoms. They can give medicine
under doctor‘s orders, she said.

The health service also conducts
its own research to determine ifearly
use of penicillin provides relief for
patients with strep throat. Bowen
said. ,

Years ago, she explained, the
health service did blood testing for
gonorrhea with the medical school.

Pitt‘s two medical branches, how-
ever, are not related in any way.

“We are the Student Health Ser-
vice, not the University Health Cen-
ter as we are commonly called,“
Bowen said.

  Memory Lapse

President Reagan’s nominee for attorney general, Edwin
Meese, seems to have a hard time remembering things these
days. That is, as long as “these days" have been spent in front of

a Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee has rightly

sought to further question Mr. Meese before voting on his
confirmation.

Letters To The Editor

In his most recent bout with “forgetfulness," Meese said a
$15,000 loan to his wife must have slipped his mind. The

interest-free loan was made by Californian Edwin Thomas.
Thomas worked for Meese in California and in the White
House. He is now an administrator for the General Services

Administration.

This brings to five the number of lenders who have secured
loans for Meese and later received federal jobs. Meese claims he
is aware of no connection between the financial favors he has
received and the sudden political rise of his lenders. This latest
attack on Meese's honesty even raised the suspicions of the

otherwise-eager committee chairman, Strom Thurmond.

Meese has also been connected with the Reagan administra-
tion's acquisition of key Carter documents from the Carter-
Reagan presidential race of 1980. The papers were obtained by
the Reagan campaign staff, headed by Meese. Meese only V
replied in writing to questions about the papers, saying that he

knew of no deliberate “effort” to secure the papers-

As attorney general, Meese would be the nation's highest law
enforcement officer. He would be in charge of enforcing the
laws governing the same type of favoritism with which he has
been associated. Meese's failure to disclose this, and previous
loans, to the investigative committee would severely hamper
his ability to carry out his appointment, should he be

confirmed.

The Democrats are trying to stop Meese's appointment for
more reasons than his failing memory. Should Meese become
attorney general and should Reagan win his re-election bid,
Meese would probably be next in line for another promotion.
The position Democrats fear Meese is headed toward is that of

Reagan‘s next appointee to the Supreme Court.

Meese‘s past actions have made him a highly questionable
candidate for attorney general, let alone Supreme Court jus-

_ tice. Meese's actions denote his totally irresponsible approach
to the law when he and his friends are involved. This is clearly
not the man for the job. Meese should not be rewarded for his

negligence with an appointment to attorney general.

]acl<son’s
comments still
seen as racist

Jesse Jackson's decision to seek
the Democratic nomination for the
presidency of the United States is
indeed a turning point for the black
community in specific and the whole
country in general. The eyes of the
nation are upon this endeavor. I
seriously doubt that there is a single
person who believes that Jackson
has a chance of securing the nomina-
tion. The benefits to be gained are in
his running rather than his winning.

Though the blacks are numeri-
cally very strong. they have never
really been especially active in presi-
dential politics. For too long, the
blacks have been excluded from our
political process or disillusioned to
the point of apathy. Block voting,
practiced by many of America‘s
minority groups, was made impos-
sible for blacks because ofthis exclu-
sion and disillusionment.

Jackson is seeking to change this.
His mass voter-registration drive is
long overdue. More important, per-
haps, is the hope and the faith he is
able to instill in the black youth of
this country that they. too, have a
stake in the American dream —
they, too. have a realistic chance at
one day becoming president of the
United States. “

John F. Kennedy did this for the
Catholic youth, and Jackson is
doing this for the black youth. The
importance of this can not be
underestimated.

In addition. Jackson is giving a
platform to many issues that are
important to the black community
but have been ignored for too long,
due in part. to the black communi-
ty‘s political disenfranchisement.
The political stakes of Jackson‘s
campaign are very high.

The moral implications are. how-
ever. even higher. To say that the
black community is no stranger to
persecution and prejudice is perhaps
the greatest understatement possi-
ble. The perpetuation of prejudice is
the greatest danger facing the black
community specifically. and the
United States in general.

Though I remain skeptical. it was
a plausible explanation for the
actions of a politically inept person.
When the reports came in of dona-
tions to Jackson‘s organization by
the Arab League. his ineptitude
began to seem like very skillfuland
well-paid propoganda.

All of this could be explained by
his compassion for the “oppressed
Palestinians." However repugnant
Jackson's actions appeared to the
Jewish community. the blacks had
to gain from his campaign. And then
he slipped....

There is no lack of nicknames for

New York City, the Big Apple being
the most common. Yet to Jackson,
New York is “Hymie Town" (for
those of you who are thankfully
uneducated in racial slurs. this is the
same as “Jew Town"). This slip of
Jackson's can not be explained away
as “compassion for the ‘oppressed
Palestinians,‘  nor can this be
viewed as anything but an insult to
the Jewish people. Rather, this is an
attack on the morality and decency
of every American citizen.

Jackson did apologize and offer
an excuse for his statements after his
campaign aides denied he ever
uttered them. He said they were
taken out of context. But is there
ever a proper context for such preju-
dice and hate‘? is there a proper time
to espouse such hate‘? As a member
of the Jewish community, I know of
none. and I doubt very seriously that
any member ofthe black community
can think of one.

The supporters of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson must now face a very hard
decision. The very moral fiber and
integrity of the black community is
at stake.

Every person has a moral obliga-
tion to distance himself from preju-
dice and racism. The black
community should attempt to sal-
vage what ever good Jackson

' accomplished and also condemn the
bad. ,

The black community must send a
clear message to America and. most
importantly, to its own youth that
racism will not be condoned no mat-
ter what color the person is and that
wiping out prejudice remains Amer-
ica's top priority.

Pitt drunkards
shame the
university

It has finally happened; I have
been so appalled by the behavior of
some of my fellow students that I felt
I needed to voice my opinion. Early
Friday morning (l2:30 a.m.), in the
space of five minutes, I witnessed
three acts of irresponsible behavior,
which were all due to the effects of
alcohol. All ofthis began at Hillman
Library, where a driver decided to
make a right turn onto Forbes

J Avenue. Being as Forbes is a one-

way street, this driver proceeded to
sideswipe a car that was waiting for
the traffic signal to change, and then
run head-on into a car that was
parked in front ofthe student union.
This driver then proceeded to try
putting_ his carin reverse and con-

tinue down Forbes. Luckily, the.
V police were there waiting for the

light to change also, and they turned
around in the intersection and
pulled up behind this demolition
driver. When the police officers went
to the driver's window and asked
him to step out of the car, he con-
tinued trying to get his car, which
had attached itself to the parked
one, moving again. His friends in the
car obviously had better sense.
because he finally turned off the car
and stepped out.

As I continued walking down
Forbes Avenue, I heard two stu-
dents yell out a window from the
sixth floor of Bruce Hall, curious to
find out what the ﬂashing lights were
all about..They then proceeded to
throw a can or cup out of this win-
dow at a car that was travelingdown
Forbes Avenue (in the right direc-
tion this time), causing this car to
stop and the driver and his passenger
to step out and discover the cause of
this barrage.

Finally, as lereached the Law
School building, I was treated to the
sight of two gentlemen walking
down the other side of the street,
spitting on the cars that were parked
there by their unsuspecting owners.

I understand that with midterms
and all, students like to go out:
unwind and just have a good time.
What I find hard to understand is,
why does this relaxing have to be
accompanied by a total lack of con-
trol on the part of these people? It is
my opinion that if you can‘t keep
yourself under control when you
drink, then don‘t. I, too, enjoy going
out and having a good time; this
does not include doing things that I
would not want to be held accounta-
ble for that morning when I have
regained complete control of my
faculties. Alcohol should be
enjoyed, not abused.

.Opinions  

From  where I stand/.Chris”"’Bosso

God’s favorite son

America, as a civilization and
nation, finds its meaning in religion.
We are, after all, a nation rooted in
religious freedom, one that sancti-
fies separation of church from state.

But this separation is chimerical, for ,

religion pervades the public and pri-
vate lives of the citizenry, giving this
most secular society a distinctly the-
istic hue.

The l9th century German scholar
Francis Grund once observed that
“Americans look upon religion as a
promoter of civil and political lib-
erty. Religion presides over their
councils, aids in the execution of the
laws and adds to the dignity of the
judges."

“And runs their political cam-
paigns," Grund might add if he saw
what Ronald Reagan is doing right
now. lfAmericans think ofGod asa
U.S. citizen, Mr. Reagan has signed
Him on as campaign manager for
I984.

Democrats may ﬂay one another
over deficits or defense, but the pres-
ident ﬂoats serenely above the fray,
wrapping his re-election campaign
in more religious symbolism than
the Vatican at Easter. The presiden-
cy is a “bully pulpit." Theodore
Roosevelt once argued, but Mr.
Reagan conveniently ignores the
first word, mixing religion and poli-
tics in ways that might prompt
James Madison and company to
rethink the First Amendment.

Since he announced his candidacy
on Jan. 29, Mr. Reagan has conﬁned
campaign speeches almost exclu-
sively to well-publicized visits in
front of fundamentalist religious

V groups. The themes he pounds home

are always the same —- rejuvenating
religion and morality in America,
putting prayer in the schools, ban-
ning abortion -- and they never fail
to stir the true believers.

Reagan‘s Jan. 30 speech to the
National Religious Broadcasters
referred to God at least 26 times,
which must be a record for any presi-
dent. The speech then became a ser-
mon: “If the Lord is our light, our
strength and our salvation,“ the
president said, “whom shall we fear,
of whom shall we be afraid?"

In a videotaped talk on Jerry Fal-
well‘s national special last week, the

president argued that “nowhere does
the Constitution explicitly mention
‘separation of church and state.‘ "
Putting prayer in the schools there-
fore cannot be unconstitutional, the
president said. Reagan's interpreta-
tion of the Constitution may be
accurate on its face; however, one
logical extension of his reading goes
against generations of legal scholar-
ship  not to mention numerous
Supreme Court rulings.

The president's religious sincerity

is not the issue; he cannot and
should not be faulted for his inner-
most beliefs. But what is painfully
obvious is that Mr. Reagan is ma-
nipulating religious symbolsiand
themes more heavily and shame-
lessly than any president in memory,
perhaps in history.

It is no coincidence that the U.S.
Senate suddenly began its long-
delayed debate on school prayer,
nor is the establishment of formal
diplomatic relations with the Vati-
can — something many Catholics
oppose
These and other actions with reli-
gious overtones have cropped up
and intensiﬁed with the start of the
campaign.

in politics. "It is a sign of spiritual
arrogance to enlist Christ in this,
Christ for that, Christ for Grenada,
God for Lebanon." says Commager.
“The president of the United
States shouldn’t be buddies with
Christ,“ he said. “What nerve. Why,
it’s an unpardonable sin."
Pro-Reagan religious leaders nat-
urally dispute Commager’s views. “I
think it is sour grapes by his oppo-
nents," retorted Moral Majority
leader Jerry Falwell. “Its not a mat-

ter of God being on our side. Reagan

is on God’s..."

Reagan‘s defenders see no incon-
gruity in their attempts to fuse pri-
vate and public morality. It is indeed
odd that fundamentalists, tradition-
ally supporters of strict separation
of church and state, now express few
qualms about interjecting religion
into politics. The difference, one sus-
pects, lies solely with who occupies
the Oval Office.

Those who wear God on their
shirt sleeves always make me
uneasy. Faith is, or should be, a pri-
vate matter, not to be bandied about
like some college ﬁght song or fast
‘food slogan. And it is worse when
politicians resort to_religion as a
campaign tactic, for their actions
only cheapen the beauty and sanc-

. tity of faith, making it as worthless

as a tin campaign button.

Maybe God is on Reagan’s side.
Only history will tell. If He is, He
might remind the president about
one scriptural passage that Mr. Rea-
gan overlooked: St. Matthew 6:5-6.

“And when you pray, do not
imitate the hypocrites; they love to
say their prayers [in public], for peo-
ple to see them...When you pray, go
to your private room. Your Father
who sees all that is done in secret will
reward you."

Amen.

The Proyost‘s area is the unit

University Counsel Ronald Tala-

after the first phase of hearings, pos-
sibly as early as .luly. Newman will
then consider the arguments made in

which will then issue a formal ruling.

“If either side is unhappy with his

~Pitt attorney downplays campus police’s legal chances  

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

In an appeal currently before the
State Supreme Court, the Pitt cam-
pus police are seeking to be classified
under a Pennsylvania statute that
would give them the option to send
stalled contract negotiations to
binding arbitration.

According to an attorney repre-
senting the university, however, the
court will probably not—reverse a
decision handed down by Common-
wealth Court prohibiting the force
from switching its classification. It is
currently classified as a group not
needed to maintain public safety.

Scott Zimmerman, one of three
attorneys from the Reed, Smith,
Shaw & McClay law firm represent-
ing Pitt in the case, said he expects
the State Supreme Court will not
grant the police status under Act I ll
because Pitt is nofa“political subdi-
vision of the state.”

Act lll was passed in l968 as a
solution to the problem ofmunicipal
and state police strikes over stale-
mated contract negotiations. Those
work stoppages led to disruptions in
maintaining public safety during the
19605. The statute applies to most
policemen and firemen in the state
and provides for binding arbitration

when contract talks become
deadlocked.

The arbitrator's ruling is binding
for both parties under Act l l I. With

Pitt's 85-member force currently
classified under Act l95, which app-
lies to all public service employees.
its only recourse to stalled contract
negotiations lS to strike.

“The suggestion that the univer-
sity belongs under l I l is what we‘re
concerned about," Zimmerman
said. “In order to be covered by l l l,
[the university] would have to be
identified as the commonwealth.
But that's not true."

Act lll covers those policemen
and firemen who are part ofpolitical
subdivisions of the commonwealth.
In the summer of I981, the Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board
(PLRB) granted the Pitt police force

represented by Lodge 99 of the
Fraternal Order of Police as its bar-
gaining agent - Act lll status.

The university successfully
appealed that ruling to Common-
wealth Court last year. President
Judge James Crumlish Jr. wrote in
that courts opinion that the univer-
sity “is defined in the University of
Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act as
an ‘instrumentality of the common-
wealth.‘ ”

Crumlish further cited that the
management and control of Pitt is
vested in the 36-member board of
trustees, l2 of whom are appointed
by the governor. Thirty percent of
Pitt's funding comes from state
coffers, too.

Because Pitt cannot levy taxes,
any contract decisions rendered in
favor of police or fire forces by arbi-
trators would result in increased
costs to the university.

“If the arbitrator awards a deci-
sion that asks for more money than

the borough or township was origi- '

nally offering, the commonwealth
must raise money for that,"Zimmer-
man explained. “The university
doesn't have that taxing power.

“Act III is really defined for a
government where police or firemen
are absolutely necessary for the gen-
eral welfare of people. We sure as
hell don't want to delegate authority
to an arbitrator who cannot-raise
funds for us."

‘They ’ve got their own reasons, and I, frank-
ly never understand them.’

-—Sc0tt Zimmerman

lf the Pitt campus police were
given the powers granted by Act I ll,
took stalled negotiations to arbitra-
tion and came away with a favorable

‘ruling. the'university would have no

alternative but to raise tuition. Zim-
merman said. _,

“You are delegating power to a
third-party arbitrator," he con-
tinued. “We don‘t have the corollary
ability to raise money. We can only
raise tuition. His [an ar_bitrator’s]
decision wouldn‘t compel us to raise

DEVELOP voun

O Supreme

tuition, but we would have no other
recourse."

l.l.‘James Watters, who, as assist-
ant director of public safety, is not
personally affected by‘; the State
Court‘s decision, con-
curred with Zimmerman.

“Act ll l was developed with
employers who had the power of
taxation in mind," Watters said ear-
lier this week. “That does not fit the
university.” .

When asked why the PLRB did

M

{I

not initially recognize Pitt as an
instrumentality of the state, Zim-
merman replied, “They‘ve got their
own reasons, and l, frankly, never
understand them."

Zimmerman further maintained
that the Pitt campus police cannot
equate the university under which
they operate with apolitical subdivi-
sion of the state. -

“That’s not valid reasoning since
the gubernatorial appointees are pri-
vate citizens," Zimmerman said.
“They exercise their best judgment
as private citizens. They are not

’ adjuncts of the governor’s office."

No definite date is set for the State
Supreme Court to rule on the appeal
by the police force, whose appeals
are now exhausted. The officers
have been operating without a con-
tract since their last pact, signed in

l976, expired in l979.

ln I979, the officers attempted to
switch their bargaining agent from
the United Plant Guard Workers of

America to the Fraternal Order...of '

Police, but only on the condition
that they switch statute classifica-
tions as well.

The plant union had negotiated
the threc—year deal, which provided
for a graduated salary scale from
$15,000 for first-year officers to
$18,000 for those on the force three
years or more. A two-week strike
during l976 Homecoming festivities
temporarily halted the signing of
that deal.

From» I970 to I976, the campus
police had been represented by the
Teamsters Union.

versity. “I've been here for 38 years,
and the most important part is the
students," said Savina S. Skewis.

The importance that she has
placed on students has not been
missed by the students with whom
she has worked.

To honor her, several of the stu-
dent groups with which she has
worked, have planned a reception to

, be held on March 31 in the Lower

Lounge of the William Pitt Union.

Skewis first came to Pitt in I946
on a leave of absence from the
McKeesport school district where
she taught home economics. “I never
went back," Skewis said.

She worked as dietician for the
University Food Service until I952
when she became the associate dean
of women. Helen Rush was the dean
of women at the time, and Skewis

succeeded her in 1965. “She [Rush].

built the program. She made it ‘a
place for women," Skewis said.

In I968, the dean of women’s
office and the dean of men's office
merged to form the dean ofstudents'
office. Skewis became the associate
dean for students until I970 when

the student affairs office moved
from the l2th floor of the Cathedral
of Learning to the student union.

Skewis decided to stay on the l2th
ﬂoor to take care of the kitchen,
which Rush had set up, and the
Braun Room. She‘s been there ever
since as a part-time consultant to the
university secretary and adviser to
many student activities.

Even though Skewis is here only
on a part-time basis, she says she still
hastime for students. “I'm usually
here seven days a week.Students are
freer on. the weekends," she
explained.

Last week, Skewis was honored at
the Honors Convocation as a dean
of women emerita. “I appreciate
whatthe students have done. None
of it would have happened without
them,“ she said. ,

The Men's Glee Club is just one
activity with which Skewis works. “I
am a supporter of student activities.
They are a good training place. Stu-
dents are so free in college. It offers
all kinds of opportunities,“ she said.

Every year for the past quarter-
century, the glee club has held a lun-
cheon on the l2th floor to recruit
new members. Skewis is always on
hand to supervise while the club
members do all of the planning, pre-
paring of food, serving and cleaning
«up. “It took them a week to prepare
it, but in doing so, they got to know
each other better, said Skewis.

“They already see how much the
luncheon meant. I feel that breaking
bread together is one of the most
humanistic things people can do.
Exchanging ideas while eating good
food and serving nicely, that’s what
comes out best from these
luncheons." .

John Snyder, who has been a club
member for three years, says that he
will always remember the 77-year-
old woman.

“Miss Skewis taught me about

responsibility and cooperation while
pgeparing our luncheons,” said
Snyder. “She also taught me how to
make great fudge and candy.

"She feels students need a place
like that kitchen so they can work
together and get closer. She‘s like a
grandmother to a lot of us,“ Snyder
said.

Skewis feels her contact with the
students makes them more comfor-
table about themselves. “Young
people want security, and I’m here as
a fence," she said.

Woody Cunningham, a graduate

t student who was a member of the,

Heinz Chapel Choir for four years,
agreed. “She thrives on being with
young people. She allows you to
speak your mind without being
childish or inferior. She has been a
major counselor for me when l have
problems," Cunningham said.
“Every chance I get.l go up there.

Some of us don‘t leave her alone.“._

This summer‘, Skewis will accom-
pany the choir to Europe for itstour

- of France. She has travelled with the

choir on European tours each year
since I976, and this will be her last
time. -

“She went with me two years
ago,“ said Cunningham. “She man-
aged to be the first awake and first to
do anything which needs to be done.
She keeps up with us, and she‘s usu-
ally the one who runs us down to the
ground.”

Is

“I can’t jog anymore, Skewis
said, “but I‘m as ‘enthusiastic as ever.
If you lose enthusiasm, you may as
well quit." ,

Tish Berkey, a choir member and
the student coordinator of the
upcoming reception, said she is glad
she got to know Miss Skewis. “She’s
so dear. She’s our mother," Berkey
said. “She runs everything like her
kitchen —- perfect."

Albert C. Van Dusen, professor
and vice-chancellor emeritus, has
worked with Skewis since 1950 and
said he will sadly miss her.

“She’s s_uch a devoted person and
servant ofthe university. She will be
sorely missed,“ Van Dusen said.
“The students were her principal
focus of interest for many years. She
has been a warm friend and good

counselor to many student groups," T

he said.

“She has also been a wonderful
ambassadress for the university. She
put in tireless ‘efforts to favorably
interpret the university. She is a
highly respected member of the uni-
versity family: administration,
faculty and students.

After she retires, Skewis plans to
do more sewing, play bridge and
walk the streets of Pittsburgh to
admire the new architecture. “I've
been on the l2th floor so much that I
haven’t had the chance to see the
new buildings downtown yet," she
said.

The current Allegheny Repertory
Theatre production at the Famous
Rider Cultural Center is a play for
this city. Written by Pittsburgher
Ruth Lesko, directed by David Mar-
chick and set in this town. Peter, Peter
explores the destruction of Harry
Van Zant, a man who lost his job
after 30 years through the Peter
Principle — the promotion of
employees to positions they can't
handle, then firing them for
incompetency.

Certain risks go along with produc-
ing a play that hits so close to home.
Would local laid-off steel workers or
fired executives want to see a re-
creation of the same troubles they're
facing today? Apparently not --
there were only 12 people in the
audience last Sunday night. The
answer to that question could have
been ”yes," but problems in the pro-
duction and script didn't let the
audience get close to the characters.

As the protagonist, Bill Dalzell's
Harry did not evoke much sympathy.
When he screamed obscenities at his
wife, he seemed more like an abusive
husband than a man whose life was
collapsing around him. The script's
”fuck you's" did not fit his character.
He couldn't even handle the second-

rate job at the magazine he finally
accepted, but one was supposed to
believe that stemmedﬁfrom his inabil-
ity to cope with his sudden
unemployment.

With no real empathy for the lead
character, the production never got
off the ground. The audience was
asked to pity Harry and even to see
him as a modern tragic hero; but, alas,
Harry came across as nothing more
than a plain wimp.

The actors and actresses were situ-
ated on a "small stage, divided into
three parts — a living room (center
stage), Harry's old office (stage right)
and the magazine's office (on a plat-
form behind the living room). There
was little space in which to move,
especially in the office scenes, result-

The final mainstage production of
the 1983-84 University of Pittsburgh
Theatre season features a much-
overlooked work by Tennessee Willi-
ams. Orpheus Dvscmuling is true to the
playwright’s style of presenting the
American South with a curious blend
of compassion and bitterness. Unlike
his more famous plays Orpheus, a re-
write of his first produced play, Battle
of /lngles, is heavily melodramatic, not
quite achieving the powerful quality
of modified realism he reached with
later plays. Still, the main characters
are unique and the dialogue richly
poetic. Symbolism, used a great deal
in all of his plays, is a bit overdone
here, starting with the allegorical
title.

ing in stifled movements by the
actors. A black and gray backdrop of
downtown Pittsburgh, looming
above the characters, added a nice
touch to the cluttered set.
Playwright Lesko's incorporation
of flashbacks in the script was, at
first, difficult to follow. The play
began with Harry, his wife and two
friends at the Van Zant home after a
New Year's party. The lights
dimmed, and Harry was then in his.
office, where he learned he was fired.
The next scene was back at the Van
Zant home on New Year's Day. It
took awhile to realize that the office
scene happened nine months ago and
that Harry had yet to tell his wife he'd
been fired. In act two, flashbacks
were clearer when used to show Har-

Like Orpheus in the myth, Val
Xavier, Williams’ main character, is a
musician with powers to enchant and
"tame wild beasts." Michael Herd
relies on his natural physical presence
in playing Val. Some of the intense
sensuality is lost, but the low—key
portrayal highlights the quiet, almost
shy, appeal of this young man in
search of spiritual freedom.

His ill-fated love affair with Lady
Torrance (the allegorical equivalent
of Eurydice) is, as in the myth, the
cause of his descent into ”hell.” This
play was chosen for actress Maria
Barney to play Lady as her final MFA
thesis project. Barney noticeably pos-
tures upon the melodramatic nature
of the play a bit heavily, but the depth
with which she captures this psycho-
logically demanding role is a joy to

ry's escape into his happier past.
The play comes to a decent close
with Harry's family and friends
gathered in his living room, and the
people he once worked with occupy-
ing the two offices. The whole stage
was used, but invisible walls divided
the rooms as the characters spoke,
sometimes simultaneously, of Harry.

Finally, in the last scene, the script
offered some insight into the rise and
fall of Harry Van Zant. One charac-
ter compared him to a dinosaur,
implying that Harry was ”done in” by
his environment, by the lightning-
fast age of computers. It was an inter-
esting parallel that could have
worked if Harry had been deserving
of more sympathy.

watch. Her talents will be missed on
Pitt's mainstage.

Lady Torrance’s "fatal viper" is in
this case her husband labe, played
with stinging viciousness by Steve W.
Brown.

Victoria Herd captures Carol's des-
perate outcast quality, and John H.
Land is cooly despicable as the cor-
rupt sheriff.

However, one of the most credible
aspects of this production was the
fact that the in the 19-member cast,
even bit characters, such as Eugenia
Miller's Eva Temple, were memora-
ble. Also, John E. Lane Jr. as Pee Wee
and M. Easton Cruber as Dog created
lively rednecks.

By DELORES RICE

Are you ready for this one? You
may want to sit down. I saw, believe it
or not, an excellent film last weekend.
It wasn't one of those golden oldies
but a spanking new release. Instead

of being thrown around by violence,

bombarded with special effects and
demoralized to the core with mean-
ingless sex, I was stunned by beauty,
warmed by romance and charmed by
humor. In other words, I saw Splash.

Splash introduces Walt Disney's
new class of motion pictures entitled
Touchstone Films. It is the beginning
of a new tradition for'Disney. Their
aim is to develop high—quality films
about contemporary romances-,
important social issues and family
dramas. Touchstone Films is out to
Create films like Kramer vs. Kramer,

By LISA LaVALLE

There seems to be a resurgence of
the Hollywood film known to us as
the romantic comedy; Unfaithfully
Yours and Blame It On Rio are both
examples of this newly revived spe-
cies. However, whatever else it may
be, this rekindled genre has been one
of the ‘simplest to materialize in
recent years. The Buddy System is the
latest case in point. It is an undeve-
loped film that, at times, resembles
nothing more than an over-

. ‘emotional episode of The Love Boat.

— Deja vu! —‘that was another reac-
tion towards The Buddy System, for it

. closely resembled Neil Simon's The
‘Goodbye Girl, which also starred

Richard Dreyfuss. However, Mary
Agnes Donoghue, a writer making
her debut in The Buddy System, has
none of Simon's wit and insight inthe
treatment of the emotional problems
between parents and children. She is
all too willing to settle for glibness.
In The Buddy System, Richard Drey-
fuss is a Californian and an amateur
inventor who patrols as a school
guard and yearns to be a successful
writer. But he concedes to himself
that he has no talent, dumps his
manuscripts on the beach and
watches the pages flutter away in the
wind. The situation would suggest
bitterness at a world that does not
recognize his talents and forces him
to waste time in a menial job. How-
ever, these events never seem to
effect Dreyfuss as they would most
people. He's the happy—go-lucky type;
he even reaches out to befriend Wil
Wheaton, a fatherless boy.

Making New Waves

splashing! Darryl (Reckless, Summer Lov-
ers) Hannah thoroughly enchants us
as Madison, the mermaid. Her fin
transforms to legs out of water, a-nd
therefore, she appears quite human,
especially to Allen Bauer (Tom
Hanks), who falls in love with her.

We first get a glimpse of them
when they are both approximately
eight years old. Allen is boating with
his family in Cape Cod. While older
brother Freddie (John Candy) is busy
dropping nickles and dimes in order
to get a look up girls’ skirts, Allen is
gazing into the glistening waters.
Then, suddenly, ‘as if the water's
temptation were too much, Allen is
propelled into the sea and witnesses a
beautiful little girl living at its
bottom. ‘

The scene shifts abruptly to New
York City, 20 years later. Allen is a
successful produce businessman.
Freddie is his partner, a man who still
has roving eyes and many hilarious
one-liners throughout the film.

Allen is distressed. He feels that
love has passed him by. "There's
something missing in here,” Allen
says to Freddie, pointing to his heart.

But one day, he falls into the ocean
at Cape Cod and is struck uncons-
cious. He awakens on a beach to the
sight of a beautiful woman with only
her long blonde tresses adorning her
body. Her only way to comunicate
(since mermaids have their own
"fishy" language) is by kissing. Allen

Susan Sarandon .

The young. lad plays matchmaker,
hoping to unite Dreyfuss and his
mother, played by Susan Sarandon.
As in The Goodbye Girl, the two meet
and instantly dislike each other. Soon
after the encounter, Dreyfuss is
dumped by his lover, Nancy Allen,
while at the same time, Sarandon's
romance with her boss sours. Their
bad misfortunes with love motivate

does not seem to mind.

Their love is very natural, even
though Allen thinks it's strange that
Madison finds "WalkIDon't Walk"
signs fascinating, enjoys eating lob-
ster unshelled and learns to speak
English fluently by watching televi-
sion for six hours. But he's happy —
happier than he's ever been in his
entire life. That is, until that fateful
night when Walter Kornbluth

questionable repute, finally proves

the two to sleep together when
Wheaton goes off on an overnight
field trip. The big night of passion,
however, turns out to be quite disas-
trous, and from that point on, they
decide to have a purely platonic
relationship.

The film then proceeds to contrast

after many trying, funny attempts,
that mermaids do, indeed, exist.

Splash is a comedy, a love story, a
fantasy. It does exactly what Touch-
stone Films promised. It reaches out
and touches you with its identifying
theme, charismatic characters and
emotional tone. Splash's magic lies
also in its believability. We all know

pleton, who turns in a most disap-
pointing performance) and the
obnoxious character portrayed by
Allen, who makes Moon Unit Zappa
seem quite normal. At the same time,
we begin to witness the development
of Dreyfuss’ relationship with Saran-

don, complete with California cliches,

group-therapy jokes and some occa-
sional sex — everything one could
hope for in a relationship!

Throughout the film, the two can't
decide — and neither can the
audience —- if - they are merely
friends, lovers. or both. This premise
convolutes the film strangely; for
example, the audience is invited to be
outraged when Dreyfuss resumes his
romance with Allen, forcing Saran-
don and her little boy out of the pic-
ture and into the world of loneliness,
but under the circumstances, it seems
perfectly reasonable.

Allen's role is stereotypical of self-
centered, selfish and loose California
women, but Allen is far. too good of
an actress to let that suffocate her.

The other too-typical role in this
film is that of Sarandon's young son.
Wheaton conforms perfectly to
movieland's conception of children
reared by single parents —— obnoxious
but cute, pesty but precocious.

What keeps The ‘Buddy System from
being appealing is its approach to the
widespread problem of the single-
parent/child relationship and its lack
of reality. It relies too heavily on
dumb gags and synthetic sentiments.
Despite its light-hearted humor and
adequate performances, this film is
still a bad clone of The Goodbye Girl.

fnter Sir, played by fiinney, the
craggy leader and driving force of the
troupe members. He is their taslcmas»
ter and their inspiration exasperat~
ing to some, tiod to others. ln either
case, he is obeyed.

\et, something is wrong with Sir.
His age and his dedication to the
theater have caught tip with him
he has given too much, and it has
drained him. Add to this the problem
of keeping his troupe operating, and
he begins to lapse into moments of
psyc‘hc\sis

flere, flinney plays the duality of

iiy. At one moment, he is the demon-
strative Sir, forever mocking his cast
with sharp——tonguecl wit and exuding
an air of grandeur, which suggests
that, in his prime, he was a brilliant
actor. .»\t other times, he is a fright~
ened old man fading in and out of
reality, afraid of the brevity of his
future and clutching at the crumbling
cornerstones of his past only to find
that most of them have been bombed
by the Nazi forces.

Sir's constant companion is Nor-
man, his dresser, played uncannily by
Tom (ourtenay, who recreates his
Broadway role. Norman knows and
understands Sir better than anyone,
and he nurtures the old actor into his
role every night, soothing him with
brandy and stories of his friends‘.

When Sir discharges himself from
a hospital after one of his "sei/ures,"
he returns instinctively to the theater
in search of l\'orman's comforting
hand, determined to perform even
though he can't remember his lines.

ft is at this precise point that the
incredible bond between actor and
dresser is slowly unraveled. Sir has
returned to the womb, a frightened
old child, and it is Norman's job to
rebuild the broken actor's psyche,
just as he must create the visage of
the character Sir is to play, King Lear.

(‘ourtenay is splendid as the
fiercely protective Norman. He hov~
ers over fiinney like a mother robin,

allowing no one to injure his old
friend. He acts with effeminate char-

Norman does manage to prepare
Sir for King Lear, and in the end, the
actor and role become one — a sad bit
of irony. But the sadness you'll feel at
this moment is a small price to pay for
the sheer emotional lift you'll expe-

exist for one purpose: to make a lot of
money in return for little investment.
The casts consist of young, mostly
unheard—of actors, and the story finc-
inost often deals with deranged
killers or sex (or both). l’.~rlci/s is a fine
example of such a movie. Silly, cheap
and mildly titillating, it grossed over
$100 million. Hey, the movie may be

you've got yourself another hit. lt'll
get bad reviews, Leonard Malten will
give it a 2, your parents will insult the
TV commercials for it, but still, it'll be
a hit. Why? Because you can't stop
your little brother from going to see

shoestring budget that it can't help
but make several times what it origi-
nally cost.

good friends with a high-ranking

the hook. But when Mahoney pcir—
posely wrecks a customer's car at the
parking lot where he works, he is
given an ultimatum: either go to jail
or join the police academy. Naturally,
he opts for the academy, which has
turned into a cesspool of incompe-
tents due to a new law that severely
lowers the requirements for joining
the police force.

All kinds of weirdos turn up at the
academy hoping to get through the
training program (a program that
seems to resemble the military train-
ing in a film like 5fri;tt‘~). There's the
rich girl (Kim Cattrall, an alumna of
l’nrlc_i/'5), who will become (§utten—

florist (ex—football star Bubba Smith);
a huge-chested, sadistic female
instructor (Leslie Easterbrook); and a
man (Michael Winslow) who can
make any kind of sound —— airplanes,
intercom systems, video games -
with his mouth, just to name a few.
Everyone has his problems, and it
doesn't look as if any of them will
graduate. But of course, the right
situation comes along — a riot breaks
out, and the trainees are enlisted to
quell the raging mob — and nearly
everyone becomes a hero, thus gra-
duating with honors and all that.

The fact that Polite /lradrmy doesn't
say anything probably won't make
any difference in its gross income.
Movies like this ——4 repetitious,

always find an audience in the young,
even if they don't deserve an
audience at all.

INTO THE GAP
Thompson Twins
Arista

Although Joe Jackson, with
his drastically varying musical
influences, is, without a doubt,
modern music's analogy to the
chameleon, observe for a
"moment the Thompson Twins.

Just a few years back, the
Thompson Twins was a band of
seven playing members with no
reputation of which to speak.
Then two years ago, Twin
leader Tom Bailey, bored with
guitars, scaled his outfit down
to three members. The new
lineup- (like its predecessor,
without a Thompson or any
twins) turned its sights to the
dance floor. The result was
some of last year's most riveting
electronics, "Lies" and "Love on
Your Side.”

And now, consider the
Thompson Twins of 1984. With
the release of Info The Gap, the

/Twins have virtually relin-
quished thoughts of people
dancing to their music. In place
of the forceful synthesizers that
gained them such widespread
attention and airplay last year,
the band has opted for a more
subtle sound.

The album's first single,
”Hold Me Now," perfectly illus-
trates the way Into the Gap relies

on backing vocals and generally‘

obscure instruments (such as

"Robert DeNiro's Waiting"/
"Push!”

tive. The opening track, "Doc-
tor! Doctor!," ”No Peace For the
Wicked," "Sister of Mercy” and
"Who Can Stop the Rain?" are
fine efforts in the new
approach. «

Problems for the Thompson
Twins occur occasionally, how-
ever, when their musical hooks
fail to catch the listener, thus
exposing Allanah Currie's fre-
quently sappy lyrics. While "No
Peace For the Wicked,” with its
coy indictment of the publicity-
seeking press, and "Sister of
Mercy," the touching story of a
woman who murders her hus-

from all sides — listless. Clear
and shiny production fails to
salvage very much.

"Push!" fills the B-side with
two unrelated parts, a short and
melancholy mostly-instrumen-
tal segment and then the vocal
treatment. ”Push!" rehashes the
"tough kid on the mean street”
theme. Its up beat should not be
mistaken for urgency, although
the girls manage some convic-
tion during their delivery.

Five writers (including the
girls) share credit for this ep.
Well, maybe next time. Banana-
rama's strong visual appeal
remains intact, but they seem to
be running out of enthusiasm or
ideas.

said of her lyrics is that the

that much, you get songs like
”The Gap" and "Storm on the

straight-out rap fo' you. Grand-

Throughout, the lp is riddled
with excellent dance synthes-
izer programming and key-
board work that grabs you by
the collar and demands to stand
on its own merits. If that doesn't
work, the light-hearted feel of
the album and varied vocal char-
acterizations by Hagen will
throw the necessary cold water
in your face.

Much of the musical richness
is, no doubt, attributable to the
album's producers. The lush-
ness of Giorgio Moroder's
treatments are offset nicely by
Keith Forsey's (Billy Idol)
ragged, punchy edge, the latter
most easily noticed in the fuzzy,
driving guitar of "Springtime In

But the best track is "Flying

Wasting Time  

VAN HALEN
March 7, 1984
Civic Arena

By JEFFREY SEWALD

If "Big Brother" had been watching
over the Civic Arena last Wednesday
night, he probably would have
gagged.

California's Van Halen rolled into
Pittsburgh on March 7, under the
auspices of their ”1984' Tour" (if one
listens closely, the rustling of Orwell
turning over in his grave can be
heard). Question: How does a physi-
cally attractive band, sporting a
number one single and enough
decibel power to fry the hair off
17,000 kids, deliver a set so tiresome
that the movements of the hydraulic
stage rigging become the highlight?
The biggest problem in answering
this question is deciding on whether
to use paragraph or list form.

OK. The obvious: the sound was

‘horrendous. Attribute this to who-

mever — a sloppy band or a sloppy
sound crew. Perhaps both. Overam-
plified and garbled sound wins no
points. Moving on....

Did anyone else happen to notice
the conspicuous lack of time in which
the entire band was on stage
together? Come on, guys, the set was
only an hour and forty minutes long
(a generous estimation). Must we be
made to suffer through a lengthy

drum solo by Alex ”Give me a break”
Van Halen? Only to be bludgeoued
by the most ridiculous display of ama-
teurish bass showmanship...pluck a
few notes with teeth...climb rigging
stage right...toss bass from rigging to
stage...climb down...jump on bass...
and then, out of the darkness came
the knife that sliced the heart out of
the show. Edward Van Halen's ten
minutes (and I say it was longer) of
guitar work. The artistry of the gui-
tarist is not in question, but I can't
help wondering where it might have
been that particular evening.

And so, Mr. Roth, you thought you
had escaped, did you (saving the big-
gest disappointment for last)? Quite
honestly, the most interesting thing
about David Lee Roth's performance
were his clothes. Decked out in an
orange net top with a black undergar-
ment, tight, tight, tight, multi-
colored pants and glittery orange
shoes, Roth looked impeccable.
Blending nicely with the hot orange
coloring of the arena seats and con-
trasting with the whiteness of the
stage, Roth bounded gingerly into
the opening number, "Unchained.”
Ah. The epitome of wonderful, gran-
diose, show-biz glitz. Until he opened
his mouth. Could this guy milk
applause! I kept wishing for a giant
hydraulic crane to emerge from the
movable metallic (futuristic?) rigging
to yank him off.

David Lee Roth...humorist: "Last
night, man, I was in my room, and
this girl kept pounding on my door,
screaming...two o'clock, three
o’clock...finally about five or six
a.m...(l-"igured out the punch line yet?)...I
opened the door and let her out!"

{Cut to Ruth standing stage right — now
in a white vest and grey, fringed pants -— he
holds a bra in his right hand at arm's length.
He shakes his head. He smirlrs.

"Edward, is this yours?”

( The guitarist laughs).

"No. We all-know it's too big to be
Va Ierie's. ”

( Roth tosses the bra aside).

”Well at least now we know that
rock and roll isn't the only thing
that's big in Pittsburgh."

. Don't Let The Little Guys Fool You!

 

 

Had enough? How about a band
that hires a midget to ‘dispense
refreshments to their vocalist? How
tall is David Lee Roth? Is he really
larger than life? Well, he's physically
larger than a midget, anyway.

Huh? Yes, yes, they did it. ”Jump."
The nation's hottest single. But
where was all the charm and person-
ality that poured out of the video? It
was totally lost in a stage show that
reeked of big-dollar, industry hype.
Bogus. Condescending. Boring.

”We got into town early," spoke
Roth, ”and were wondering what to
do, so we decided to waste a little time
right here in Pittsburgh.” Fine. Only
next time, don't charge for it.

Pitt’s Roger Kingdom is shown here winning the NCAA outdoor hurdle title. Kingdom won the indoor title over the weekend.

,National Acclaim  

Kingdom pegged as 1988 Olympic decathlete

By Tom Weir
Courtesy of USA TODAY

After Roger'Kingdom won the
I00-meter hurdles at last year's
NCAA outdoor championships and
the Pan-American Games, Willie
Davenport was asked to reflect on
the Pittsburgh sophomore‘s Olym-

pic chances. _
“If he‘s not careful," said Daven-

port, l968 gold medalist in the I00-
meter hurdles, “he may win the
whole thing.“

Kingdom‘s Olympic outlook still
looks bright after a victory at last
Saturday‘s NCAA indoor cham-
pionships. But while Kingdom
appears to be another in a long line
of great USA hurdlers, he might be

‘the man who halts the USA decline

in the decathlon.
The USA has won [0 of IS Olym-

 

Championship...page 21

Press Box

Hickman reigns

Freshman swimmer Susan Hickman gained All-
America status last night by placing in a tie for
fourth in the 50-yard freestyle event at the NCAA

pic decathlons but almost certainly
won‘t get a medal this year. Mark
Anderson, the top USA-performer
last year, ranked only l5th world-
wide.

Kingdom will run only the hurdles
this year but hopes to restore USA‘
dominance in the decathlon in the
1988 Olympics, at Seoul, South
Korea. .

“I want to be the first .person to
ever make the Olympic team in the
hurdles’ and the decathlon,” said
Kingdom.

The 6-1, 182-pound Kingdom has
a rare blend of speed, strength and
agility. He won Georgia state high
school titles in the hurdles and_dis-
cus in I982, holds the Pitt highjump
record of 7-! and is a free safety on
the football team.

“A lot of athletes would be good
in the decathlon, but they don’t train
for it because of fear,” said King-
dom. “They're scared of all the work

Kingdom fit that description a
year ago.

“Last summer was the first time he
really worked,“ said Elbert
Kennedy, Kingdom‘s coach on the
New Image Track Club. “He’d come
to practice, run a little, then he’d
hide out. I’d have to go and find
him.”

A major obstacle to Kingdom’s
decathlon aspirations will be the
pole vault. He hasn’t vaulted since
his freshman year in high school,
when he cleared 10 feet, far below
Olympic standards.

“The pole vault is questionable,"
said Kingdom. “I‘d have a lot of
work to do." -

He also is untested in the decath-
lon’s ﬁnal event, the l,500 meters.

But the marks he already has set in
the other events clearly put him
within range of the world record of
8,779 points held by Jurgen Hingsen
of West Germany. .

Kingdom's best marks and what
they would be worth are: 100 meters,
l0.5, 959 points; 400 meters, 46.5,
974; I00-meter hurdles,‘l3.44, L026;
high jump, 7-I, 992; long jump, 25
feet, 925; javelin, I80 feet, 697; shot

put, 50 feet, 839; discus, 175 feet,
930.

If he becomes a l4-foot pole vaul-
ter (874 points) and runs a 4:40 1,500
meters (525), which isn't terribly
fast, those marks would add up to
8,741 points. That's 75 points more
than Olympic favorite Daley
Thompson of England scored while
winning the decathlon at the World
Track and Field Championships last
year. And he’s already better than
Thompson and Hingsen in five
events.

“And remember,“ said Kingdom,
“that most track athletes don’t peak
until they’re 25. I'm only 2|.”

The Pitt News, Friday, March 16, 1984

College basketball analyst
Dick Vitale said Wednesday
morning that he was incorrect in
reporting that Pitt recruit Cha-

'rles Smith had decided not to
attend the university.

However, Vitale maintained
that he will wait until September
to see if freshman guard Curtis
Aiken remains with the
Panthers. _

In an interview with The Pitt
News, Vitale said: “The Charlie
Smith story started about a week
ago. There was a story in the
Hartford Courant about his

- decision wavering over whether
to go to Pitt or Connecticut. I
told Roy Chipman [Pitt's head
coach] that.

“I’m sorry that I reported it,
but I learned a long time ago that
I have to trust my sources.”

When asked what his reasons
were for not speaking with either
Smith or Aiken before the
announcement, he said: “l’ve
been burnt nine out of 10 times
when I ask the kids. They won’t

tell you. I must say this though, I
know now that Charlie Smith is
going to Pitt. I could see in eyes
that he wasn’t kidding. The fans
in Pittsburgh can be happy.
They’ll be proud of him.”

Aiken remains baffled by the
story about his transferring.

“It isn’t true at all. I never said
it to anybody. I spoke my piece in
three newspapers in the past
week. I haven’t said anything to
anybody that would lead them to
say that. . ‘

“I've had exams this week, and
I don‘t want all of this stuff. I
don‘t need to be bothered with it.
I had reporters calling me at 2
and 3 o’clock in the morning.”

The Penn State Nittany Lions
bring their top three national rank-

hopes to Trees Hall tomorrow night
at 7:30 pm. for a gymnastics meet
with Pitt.

The Panthers (14-2), who finish
the regular season tomorrow, have
been working hard all week in prac-
tice and plan to pull out all the stops
necessary to meet the tall challenge
of upsetting the Lions.

“if they [Penn State] make mis-
takes, we have a good shot at win-
ning," said head coach Frank
D‘Amico. “its going to be a good
meet, and [it] should be won by only
a couple points."

“We just want to keep our rou-
tines clean." said sophomore Mark
Klafter.

For seniors Dave Smith and
Frank Kratz, Saturday's meet is
their home finale.

Both have had fine careers as
Panthers. Kratz went to the NCAA
championships and was named to
the All-East team his freshman year.

He performs in the all-around com- I
' petition. which is the six events in
-gymnastics —- floor exercise. pom-

mel horse, rings. vault, parallel bar _

and high bar. His name is in the

_Panther record book for the 9.75

mark he received for a vault during
his sophomore season. .

. Smith has competed in the NCAA
championships and has been a
member of the All-East team for
each of his first three seasons at Pitt.
Smith'performs in all of the events
except for the pommel horse. He
holds the school record in the floor
exercise (9.65).

“We have the capability to beat

_ Penn State if we hit our routines."

Smith said. “i want to enjoy my last
meet by going out on a winning note.

After establishing a new Lady

at the trials ofthe NCAA swimming
national championships at Indiana-
polis, lnd., freshman Susan Hick-
man gained All-America status by
tying for fourth place (23.35) in the
finals of the 50-yard freestyle event.

“She swam fabulous with a time
of 23.26 [in the trials]," Pitt coach
David Belowich said last night.
“Both races were extremely close the
entire way."

Fellow freshman Tracy Pfister
competed in the 200-yard individual
medley (50-yards of each stroke:
backstroke, breaststroke. freestyle
and butterﬂy).

Pfist failedtoscoredespitecom—

“Tracy just didn‘t swim up to par
today," Belowich said. “But she'll

Maligned Boston College forward Martin Clark quit the squad
Wednesday, right before tonight‘s meeting with St. Joseph’s at the

earlier this season, said incidents over the past two years caused him to
quit. »

The kudos keep rolling in....

Its that time of year again when collegiate basketball players and
coaches reap their just rewards for achievements over the past season.
North Carolina guard Michael Jordan and Oklahoma forward
Waymon Tisdale were unanimous selections to the,Associated Press

North Carolina and Akeem Olajuwon of Houston were the other
selections.

In the coaching department, Purdue‘s Gene Keady, who led the
Boilermakers to a share of the Big Ten title, was named coach of the

United Press International named DePaul’s Ray Meyer as its coach

the Blue Demons to a 26-2 record and a No. 4 ranking in the polls.

North Carolina’s Dean Smith, whom Meyer outpolled by a 4-1

Cristina Perez and Rodrigo Dominguez of the local dance group La Fiesta will

perform at tomorrow’s

Quadrangle.

Latin, American-Caribbean festival

in Forbes

Latins, not leprechauns,
take over Forbes Quadrangle

St. Patrick's Day means
green and Irish accents, but
not at Pitt.

On that day, Forbes Quad.
splashed -with colors and
ringing with Spanish meio-
dies, will host the Fifth annual
Latin American-Caribbean
Fesnval

The festival. sponsored by
the Centerfor Latin American
Studies, will feature a wide
variety of music, dance and
cuisine.

The festival, according to

Alan Adelman, a member of’

the coordinating committee.
is an‘ opportunity for the cen-
ter to not only introduce Latin
America to North Americans
but provide Pittsburgh's rela-
tively small Hispanic com-
munity with a vehicle to
share both the culture and
contemporary realities of
their respective countries.

As Jose Cisneros, this year's
festival chairman said, “The
rest of the year, we [the cen-
ter] have seminars on politics.
This is one day a year to get
away from academics."

in addition to the music.
food and dancing, which will

carry on all day, there will be
children's activities, includ-
ing a carnival and a pinata.

Also featured at the festival
will be two award-winning
films. The first, “Bitter Cane,"
is a film documentary that
takes an in-depth look at
Haiti. the beautiful but
poverty-ridden Caribbean
island. Showings are at 1:30,
4:45 and 8 p.m. The second
film, "Chuquiago," exposes
Bolivia's culture and eco-
nomic system by observing
the lives of four Bolivians.

Although this is a cultural
event. Cisneros says that “by
no means are we excluding
politics." One section of the
festival will consist of tables
where groups concerned
about Latin America and the
Caribbean will be able to dis-
tribute literature.

According to Adelman,
past chairman of the festival,
attendance in past years has
been excellent. Until 1982,
the festival was held in the
Student Union over a two-
day period. Although the
move to Forbes Quadrangle
came with regrets, he said. it

 

 

,_  ii?!’ -;7_-':\,,,¢ ,,,5,

has worked out for the best.
According to Adelman, the
Student Union was only able
to accomodate about a thou-
sand people. This year, as in
the last two years, two to
three thousand people are
expected.

The festival is free and
open to the public. Per-
formers and food will be pro-
vided by groups such as the
Caribbean Association of
Pittsburgh, Club Cultural
Espanol de Pittsburgh, La
Fiesta, “Muica Latina" —
WYEP radio. Spanish-
Portugese Club of the
University of Pittsburgh,
Seton Hill College and the
University of Pittsburgh at
Greensburg.

The Dltt News wel-
comes the opportunity to
include events from all
around the Oakland area.
