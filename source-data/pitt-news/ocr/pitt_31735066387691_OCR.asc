The Ambassador of Ghana,
James Victor Gbeho, lectured to
Pitt's African Heritage committee
and guests at the Twelfth Annual
African Heritage Classroom fund-
raising dinner, held in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union Assembly Room
Sunday night. .

The African Heritage Commit-
tee was formed 12 years ago to
raise funds for the establishment

of an African Heritage Classroom
in the Cathedral of Learning. ‘

. The classroom, based on the
theme ”The Essence of Mother
Africa,” has been designed to
resemble a country yard, re-
presentating various African na-
tions ranging from the Arabs in
North Africa to the people of the
Ivory Coast.

Twenty nationality rooms
presently exist in the Cathedral of
Learning, with the Israeli Heritage
room as the most recent addition.

_NationaIity Room Director
Maxine Bruhns said that the Afri-
can Heritage Classroom, sched-
uled for opening in April, will
have a greater impact then the
newly installed lsreali room.

’ ”The lsreali room deals with
simple concepts 4- the Ten Com-

mandments, the dead sea scrolls
of Isaiah — but the African room
is much grander. It deals with the
kingdoms of Africa,” Bruhns said.

Gbeho spoke about the achiev-
ments of African culture in vari-
ous aspects of life, affecting art
and music, especially jazz and
blues compositions.

”African Heritage is timeless,”-
said Gbeho. ”Itis not art for art's

I sake. It is a living thing.”-

Gbeho concluded his lecture
by stressing the urgency of the

committee's task. He said that the ‘

committee's work is crucial for

the preservation of culture for fu-

”The presence of an African
Heritage Classroom is long over-
due,” saidfund-raising commit-
tee member Mabel Love. ”Blacks
have been taken for granted; the
classroom will give an image of
a group of people who also have
cultural significance.”

Delta Sigma Theta Sorority
President Helen Bowers said that
the opening of the room should

have been scheduled sooner, for _‘

next term.

”The overall effect won't be

that significant if the room opens
in April,” said Bowers.

Pitt fraternities say
more raids unlikely

By Jason Hillman
and Rich Cholodofsky

The Pitt News ’

”You’re going to have [under-
age drinking],” said Paul Demay,
Pitt's Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
president. .”The fraternites at
CMU were just the ones who got
caught.”

The arrest of over 100 students
at Carnegie Mellon University on
Friday night has [brought to light
the possibility that Pitt fraternities

could also be raided.

Most fraternities, however,
don't seem too concerned. Some
Pitt fraternities seem to believe
that the chances of a raid are slim.

”I just think that [the CMU
fraternities] have been charging
for parties, and the LCB has been
cracking down,” said Theta Chi
President Robert Whitten. ”If un-
derage drinking was the problem,
I can't say we are going to do a
thing because  50 to 60 percent
of our brotherhood is under 21,
and I'm not going to tell them to
stop.” . S

”I think our [fraternities] take
more precautions than the [frater-
nities] at Carnegie Mellon,” said
Bridget Guernsey, Pitt Greek ad-
visor. ”We don't have [fraterni-
ties] who have signs that flash

‘party’ on the house. That's invlit-I I

ing trouble.” .-

-’’I think the CMU fraternities
were pretty stupid,” said Michael
Carrozza, president of the Delta
Sigma Phi. ”They were not very
discrete.”

However, the raid did empha-
size the use of some precaution-
ary procedures recommended or
required by the Interfraternity
Council.

”| feel kind of lucky something .
like that didn't happen here at '
Pitt,” said IFC Vice President Dan.
Skowron. ”It taught all Greeks in-
the area some important lessons:
to use a guest list, to monitor un-‘
derage drinking and to’ be aware.
of what is going on around you."

‘ ”I think it makes students more
aware, especially people who
aren't even Greeks,” said Guern-

sey. "If you're someplace, drink- .
ing, and you're underage, youfre ’

liable for yourself.”

Right now, Guernsey said she
feels most people aren't taking
theraid on CMU too seriously.

’’If we were to start carding, it
would keep our social parties
down to small groups,” said Car-
rozza. He said they try to keep,

from getting caught by not charg- '

ing and keeping a guest list. ”We .
make sure they are Pitt students.
We don't check age.”

Cuban prisoners riot; don’

OAKDALE, La. — Cuban in-
mates holding a burned-out fed-
eral detention center Monday
demanded permission to remain
in the United States and threat-
ened to kill their hostages if
authorities attempt a rescue, the
warden said.

In Atlanta, authorities reported
a disturbance Monday among
Cubans being held for deporta-
tion there. Police and firefighters
surrounded the area, light smoke
from fires enveloped the building
and several injuries were
reported.

Hundreds of law enforcement
officers surrounding the Oakdale

. detention center settled in for ”a

long haul" as negotiations for the
freedom of 25 hostages con-
ﬁnued.

Authorities used telephones
and walkie-talkies for negotia-

. tions between federal officials

and a group of inmates who
claimed to speak for most of the
1,000 Cuban prisoners at the Fed-

‘ eral Detention Center.

”They always remind us that
any time we attempt to rush into
this facility in any manner, armed

or unarmed, they are going to kill
the hostages,” said Warden J.R.
Johnson.

Russ Bergeron, a spokesman
for the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that
25 guards and staff members
were being held hostage.

Brutal ex-Nazi guard
captured in Argentina

NEW YORK — A 75-year-old
man arrested earlier this month in
Argentina is described in Austri-
an police files as one of the most
brutal commandants of the Nazi
labor camps, according to a pub-
lished report.

Josef Schwammberger, arrested
Nov. 13 on a remote ranch near
Cordoba, Argentina, was accused
of shooting and torturing
hundreds of Jews, the New York
Times reported in Monday's edi-
tions. The story was based on
files obtained and made available
to the newspaper by the Anti-
Defamation League of B’nai
B’rith.

Schwammberger faces extradi-
tion to West Germany.

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED mass

Austrian police files said
Schwammberger admitted during
questioning in 1945, before he
escaped detention, that he had
shot about 35 Jews and kept
sacks of gold and diamond jewel-
ry that had come from Jewish
slave laborers, the newspaper
said.

Schwammberger said in the
confession that he had been or-
dered to shoot the Jews for trying
to flee the camps, that he had
been given the valuables volun-
tarily and that he had found other
riches buried under a cellar, the
Times said.

His claims, though, were
challenged by camp survivors
who said they saw him execute
and torture hundreds of Jews, set
his dog on prisoners and use a
pliers to tear gold teeth out of
prisoners while he was comman-
dant of two forced-labor camps in
Nazi-occupied eastern Poland in
1943 and 1944,_t_he Times said.

Robert P. Casey Monday signed
legislation requiring most Penn-
sylvania drivers to use seat belts
or pay a $10 fine.

The law can or ly be enforced
‘if a driver is stoppr id for and con-
victed of another /iolation. The
buckle-up provision is effective
immediately, but police officers
will give drivers a four-month
grace period before issuing ci-
tations.

The law also applies to front-
seat passengers.

Bills proposing stiffer fines had
been defeated in the General As-

sembly, but Casey said strength- _

ening the law would probably be
attempted in increments.

”The key point here is that we
have a law on the books.  If the
seat-belt law saves a single life,
then it will be a success,” Casey
said.

In addition to saving lives,
Casey said the law would result
in lower medical costs and less
lost-work time from accidents.

 
Correction

The Pitt News incorrectly identified
the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity as Pi
Kappa Phi in its editorial on page 5
in yesterday's paper. Also, Fred
DeLeon was incorrectly identified as
a brother of Pi Kappa Phi in an arti-
cle on page 1. He is actually a brother
of Pi Kappa Alpha.

Drumming up some
interest in the band

When one thinks of the University of Pittsburgh, athletics is
usually the first thingthat comes to mind. Though it is a major

Get a jobsha da da da ...  

research university, the fact remains that Pitt football and basket.-
ball, among other sports; are the main attraction here.‘

This year, the football team has done a tremendous job for
our university and has played its way into a ‘bowl game. The
Pitt band has also done a tremendous job, as it does every year.
While hardworking athletes get pats on the back, it seems that
if the Pitt band does not travel to Houston for the Bluebonnet

Bowl, they will only be getting stabbed in the back.

The band has worked side by side with the athletes. They
must endure long hours of practice, they must perform during
the game as do the athletes, and they must make personal
sacrifices just like the athletes. In short, they are a major sup-

port system of this university, just like the athletes.

It seems ludicrous forthe athletic department to even have
a second thought as to whether the band should attend the
game. Granted, the money is aconsideration —— but band mem-
bers have even discussed raising the money themselves in order
to play in the Astrodome. This is not only a significant state-
ment on their behalf, but it further proves that they are eager,
hardworking students who are willing to do whatever it takes
to partake in an event they worked just as hard to get to as the

athletes.

The leaves are turning, and so
is my stomach. Why, you might

ask? Seems I have to graduate this 

December. I've been told that
there's nothing better than to
graduate from college and start
down the ole career path.

I'm supposed to get a good job,
wear a suit and tie every day in
order to look respectable and do
the daily nine-to-five routine af-
ter being around this place and
you people for the last four plus
years. Might be impossible.

Sure, it's about time to wake up
and start accepting some real
responsibility. But, like I said, it
will be hard after hanging around
this place for a while.

Take, for example, the fact that
I can conceivably blow off my 9
or 10 a.m. class any day I want
here, and really, without getting
into that much trouble or falling

too far behind everyone else. Try

that more than once on the job

JEFF
IMAFF

and you're gone._

I like to party with my friends,
and if I want to keep my job, I'm
going to have to quit. I mean, you
can't be drinking at C.J.'s or
Mitchell's every night because
you'll most likely miss the 7:23
71 C downtown the next morning
because of a ‘hangover. ”So,"
you're saying to yourselves, ”quit
drinking and partying you slob.
You've been doing it for four
years now.” It is a hard habit to
break.

And how about fashion? Why
go out and pay thousands of dol-
lars for a new wardrobe of finely
tailored suits and silk ties, when
the flannels, jeans and T-shirts
that I possess and wear now are
fine.

My most important argument
for taking time in graduating is
probably the stress situation.
Fifteen credits a semester, and
don't you dare get below a C for
fear of losing time by having to

‘ take that class over. That's kinda

hard for some people, especially
if they have a job or extracuricu-
lar activities. Nine or 12 credits
is OK, and it's_ more time that you
have to enjoy before reality slaps
you in the face. -
There is plenty of time to live,
and why not live it up for a while?
When you graduate and get that
job, chances are you'll miss this

place, the people, the good times ‘

and the comparative lack of
responsibility. Slow down, take it
easy. If you are the right person,

you'll be able to get that job .

whenever you want it.

Undergraduates who must take
out high interest loans and work
after classes and on weekends to
pay their tuition to this state-

note of the recently constructed
parking lot behind the Cathedral
of Learning and next to the Bicen-
tennial log cabin.

[It is of] little convenience, ap-
parently a Christmas gift from
President Posvar to his executive
staff, probably costing the univer-
sity $75,000. When your tuition
goes up $500 next year, and Dr.
Posvar tells you it's needed to
maintain academic excellence,
think of the lovely new parking
lot you have helped to construct
next to the permanent, winter-

Another side

I would like to share another
side of coach Mike Gottfried with
you. I work on the John Merck
Program for Multiply Disabled
Children at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic. During the
recent mild weather, Lou Dani-
lovics, a co-worker, and myself
took seven of our children on a
group outing to a playground.
We did not realize that the facili-
ty was private, and we were po-
litely asked to leave by the staff.
Naturally, the children were dis-
appointed. ‘

On returning to the unit, we

ing. I asked the Pitt Campus
Police officer if we could watch,
explaining our situation. He gra-
ciously said yes.

After watching the team prac-
tice for a few minutes, Coach
Gottfried approached where we
were seated, accompanied by
Craig Heyward. He introduced
himself and Craig and asked
some general questions about our

' group. He then returned to the

team but allowed Craig to spend
a few minutes with our children.

A few minutes after Craig
returned to practice, a manager
brought our children a Pitt Pan-
ther official program. Finally the
equipment manager brought over
jerseys for the entire group.
Needless to say, the children
were wildly excited.

Therefore, I would like to take
this opportunity to thank Coach
Mike Gottfried, Jesse Long,
Richard Ellison, Joe Wall and the
entire Pitt Panther football team
and staff for brightening the lives
of some very special children.

There's no quieting this band. It's the second time they've played Pittsburgh in one year.

(Dames at Sea: a funny spoof

on Hollywood musicals of '30s

By Richard E. Pozzuto

Contributing Editor

So ya feel like yer goin’
bananas, huh? Yer hurtin’  hur-

’ tin’ real bad, right? Well get out

of that corner and smile the
American way!

It ain't no ”coinkydink” that
the Pittsburgh Public Theater is

-producing the ”magnifikay”

Dames at Sea for the sheer
”playzeer” of it. Following the
Public’s presentation of the rather
heavy Hairy Ape, Dames at Sea
is an about-face revolution from
the sublime to the joyously
ridiculous.

With its ”backstage on Broad-
way” plot line, Dames at Sea
rigorously yet ‘affectionately
spoofs those lavish, Busby Berke-
ly/Warner Brothers musicals of
the 19305 such as 42nd Street
and Footlight Parade. The central
characters are based on those
created by Ruby Keeler and Dick
Powell in these films.

Dames at Sea tells the story of
Ruby, a wide-eyed innocent from
Utah who arrives in New York
with nothing but a pair of tap
shoes in her suitcase and a dream
in her heart —— to become a
Broadway star. Sound familiar?

Almost immediately, Ruby
hooks up with the ”acid-
tongued” chorus girl, Joan, who
takes her under her wing and gets
her a job on the chorus line of the

show being produced by the per-
petually frustrated Hennesey.
Ruby, exhausted and hungry,
faints into the arms of Dick, a
sailor/songwriter-with-a-dream.
And, you guessed it, it's love at
first sight.

In walks Lucky, Dick's Navy
buddy, who, of course, is a form-
er concubine of Joan. Enter
Mona, the high—strung prima don-
na‘ of '30s lore. Mona instantly
sinks her canines into Dick-and-
his—dream and tries to get Ruby
on the next bus for Utah —- yet
another of the grotesquely
familiar plot twists ala Busby B.

There are 17 musical and tap
numbers in the show, and each
one of them lovingly spoofs the
work of Cole Porter, the Gersh-
wins, Kern, Berlin and Rodgers
and Hart. Pleasantly surprising is
the fact that although there are a
copious number of musical inter-
Iudes for a two—hour show, one
never becomes bored, and the
music, in fact, is not an aside to
the plot but is artfully construct-
ed to be part of the plot.

The production is being direct-
ed and choreographed by Broad-
way veteran Neal Kenyon, who
staged the original 1968 New
York production. According to
cast member Karyn Quacken-
bush (Ruby), he is a ”real work-
horse.” The show’s vitality and
polish will attest to that as well to

Kenyon’s self-proclaimed
cathexis with the subject matter.

The cast handles the characteri-
zations of the stars—of—old super-
bly well. This is especially
evident in cast member Karen
Prunczik (Joan), whose superior
tap-dancing ability redeemed the
only slightly weak part of the

show — some of the other cast‘

member's lack of it. Her ”acid
tongue,” however, could use a
few more pH points. Dorothy
Stanley (Mona) did an excellent
job shrewing about and wreaking
havoc, and Karyn Quackenbush
(Ruby) was typecast for her

”wide—eyed” looks and melliflu-l

ous voice.

The three male cast members,
Allen Stevens (Hennesey/The
Captain), Jeff Calhoun (Lucky)
and Ron Bohmer (Dick) all gave
high-energy, high-camp perfor-
mances and succeeded in captur-
ing that peculiar version of
streamlined masculinity so fa-
mous in the World War II era.

I thought I would hate this
show having been jaded by an
era of explicit sex and violence.
I do very much hate _late-night re-
runs of those Busby'Berkeley’s
glitzy ditzy nightmares. I often
wished I could reach into the
screen and slap the shit out of
those elegant tap-dancing fools.
Dames at Sea let me laugh at
them, and for that I am grateful.

Di Meola: uniting
tradition and hi-tech

By Mark R. Brown

Staff Writer

Among contemporary jazz su-
perstars, Al Di Meola stands out
as an example of excellence. The
Al Di Meola Project will be per-
forming at Graffiti this Wednes-
day night. .

Di Meola and his international
group have just begun their U.S.
tour to promote their latest LP
Tirami Su, which translates from
Italian as ”uplifting.”

Tirami Su was released in Sep-
tember of 1987 by Manhattan
Records, his third album on that
label. Joining Di Meola are
Brazillian vocalists Jose Renato

and Clara Sandroni and percus-

sionists Carlos Da Silva Pinto and
Roberto Bastos Pinheiro, also
from Brazil.

Former Jean Luc Ponty key-
boardist Kei Akagi and drummer
Tommy Brechtlein (formerly of
Chic Corea’s band) join percus-
sionist Mino Cinelu (formerly
with Miles Davis) and bassist An-

- thony Jackson to form the Al Di

Meola Project, possibly the hot-
test jazz ensemble since Return
To Forever was together.

Return To Forever consisted of
Di Meola, Chic Corea, Stanley
Clarke and Lenny White. All four
artists shared a Grammy Award in
1975 for the best instrumental
jazz performance by a group for
their Romantic Warrior.

From 1974 to 1976, RTF put
out three albums (Where Have I

   

Known You Before, No Mystery
and Romantic Warrior) before
each artist embarked on their solo
careers. Di Meola’s solo album,
Land Of The Midnight Sun, was
the biggest selling debut LP for
Columbia Records in 1976.

Looking at Di Meola’s proven
track record, one sees a variety of
awards. Guitar Player magazine
has lauded him repeatedly, citing
him as the best acoustic guitarist
from 1984 to 1986 and as the
best jazz guitarist in 1977-79 and.
again in '81. '

Di Meola_’s next solo album,
Elegant Gypsy, had a
pronounced Latin feel to it. Com-
bining electronic music with
soulful ”spacieness,” that album
won Di Meola l977fs best guitar
LP award from Guitar Player
magazine.

Augmenting the talents of the
individual performers are some
state-of-the-art technological
devices. Di Meola uses a 32—track
digital synclavier for pre-
production, in addition to spend-
ing about two months working
with Kei Akagi with combina-
tions of synthesizers and of DXs,
Midis and synclaviers.

While his music is a mixture of
electronic and acoustic, it's Latin
influence lends it an intimate
flavor about as palatable as an
aged bottle of heady wine. If you
like your music so good that you
can taste it, then say hello to Al
Di Meola Wednesday night.~-

Men Without Hats
Pop Goes the World
Mercury/Polygram Records

After a fashionable attempt to
analyze the world's problems
and come up with solutions so
easily rendered by most of to-
day's pop musicians, Men
Without Hats has a brighter out-'
look on life.

Singer/songwriter Ivan has
stopped trying to assess the hu-
man race as he did in the band's
second LP, Folk of the 805 (Part
III). ,

Instead, he has opted to be at
peace with his surroundings and

only condemn his own flighty '

genre. _ D
Pop Goes the World, the
band's third" album, celebrates
rock ’n’ roll. No guitar feedback
or drum solos or slam dancing,
mind you. Men Without Hats
celebrates the sophisticated,
techno-pop present-day rock ’n’
roll‘. .
”Pop Goes the World" has an
overly simplified melody
designed to stick in your mind
like a binding adhesive, backed
by a concise lyrical satire.
”Johnny and Jenny,” the song's
mythical (but typical) rock stars,
let growing stardom make them
as much money as possible:

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 24, ‘I 987 .

By Robin Shepherd
Staff Writer

The ”not guilty by reason of in-
sanity” plea has been used more
often lately as a defense by per-
sons accused of crimes. This
defense is so commonplace that
it has become tedious. It makes
one wonder if someone can
honestly be deemed not respon-
sible for his own actions because
he or she was ”insane” at the
time of the crime.

Nuts, Barbra Streisand’s first
film since 1984's Yentl, takes a
new approach to the subject. The
film concerns a young woman
accused of manslaughter strug-
gling to prove she is sane and
competent to stand trial. Mean-
while, her parents and psy-
chiatrist are doing their best to
keep her in a mental hospital ”for
her own good.”

Claudia Draper, played by
Streisand, is a complete noncon-
formist, so intent on being honest
that she generally is quite mean
and nasty.

Sometimes we wonder: does
this girl like anyone? Her lawyer,
played by Richard Dreyfuss, be-
comes her only champion. Initial-
ly, he displayed a decided lack of

K
Continued from page 6
(it seems)/Make more money on
a movieiscreen/Every little nest
needs a bird/Pop goes the world!

The song features a two-minute
intro with a little girl saying, ”This
is the big one, the one you've all
been waiting for,”-before she in-
troduces the band.

Ivan illustrates how difficult it
is to convert the challenges fac-
ingthe world into a catchy melo-
dy, and the album explains why
he doesn't even try anymore:

Every time I wonder/Where the
world went wrong/lend up lying
on my face going ringy dingy
ding dong. ' ‘

”On Tuesday,” the second;

track on the album, has one of
those melodies you think you've
heard before, although it's com-
pletely original. 
It's a stark contrast to their cus-
tomarily jumpy synth/pop, thanks
to‘a mellowiflute harmony sup-
plied by Jethro Tull’s Ian An-
derson. '
Again, Ivan doesn't try to recti-

fy society, choosing to sing a sim-

ple yeteloquent love song. ”On
Tuesday” mixes today's technol-
ogy with one of the world's ol-
dest wind instruments to produce
a hauntingly familiar tune.

The rest of the album is a
sophisticated musical reflection
of the sound that made the band
international stars with * ”Safety
Dance.”

enthusiasm for the case and was
obviously put off by Draper's
overt hostility.

He is eventually won over by
her absolute confidence in herself
and her refusal to compromise
her beliefs, even if it comes at her
own expense.

Claudia Draper is obviously a
complex character; what's more,
she is an unorthodox person try-
ing to prove her sanity to the out-
side world. Streisand’s per‘-
formance is nothing short of
remarkable — she manages to
gain the respect of the audience

' while playing a difficult, unlike-

able woman. Her utter devotion
to the role overcomes the view-
er's initial distrust of the charac-
ter and, in addition, challenges

the viewer's preconceived notion .

of the typical Barbra Streisand ap-
proach to a character.

In addition, Dreyfuss’ convinc-
ing performance outweighs short-
comings in the script’s
development of his character.
Also notable is Karl Maiden as

‘Draper's stepfather, playing the

On the whole, Nuts is more a.

create tension and intrigue, it
leaves too many loose ends and
winds up just creating confusion.-
Those searching for excitement
or suspense will not find it here.

Nuts’ strengths lie in a thought-

very nature of insanity, especial-
Iy in the character Barbara Strei-
sand plays. In addition to starring,

Brookin injures shoulder, will  

Rod» Brookin

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Pitt coach Paul Evans has com-
plained all along that his team's
rating (fourth in last week's As-
sociated Press poll) is ridiculous-
ly high. But at the rate the
Panthers’ preseason problems are
increasing, Evans may not have to
worry about a lofty place in the
Top 10 much longer.

At yesterday's practice, Rod
Brookin, Pitt's 6-foot-5 sopho-
more forward, dislocated his left
shoulder. He will be out at least
one week.

The Pitt women's volleyball
teamwas upset by host Provi-
dence College in the semi—finals

of the Big East tournament on‘

Sunday.

There will be some

After losing the first two games
(8-15, 8-15), the Lady Panthers
rallied to take the next two from
Providence (15-.10, 15-9) before
losing a closely contested fifth
game (14-16).,

The loss leaves Pitt’s hopes of
participating in the NCAA tourna-
ment up in the air.

The Pitt wrestling team com-
peted in the Ohio Open at
Wright State University this past
weekend.

Pat Santoro placed first at 142,
and Jeff Turner took sixth for Pitt's
only two awards.

-”This was a tough weekend for J

the guys,” said Pitt head coach

Rande Stottlemyer. ”We have to '

 

ticipation as a result of our defeat
in the Big East tournament. This
is my favorite Pitt team and pos-
sibly the best [team] I've had. It
makes the loss very hard to take.

”By beating Penn State twice as
well as defeating Houston, Loui-
siana State and Ohio State, it
seems like we have earned the
right to qualify for the NCAA
tournament,” observed Pitt coach
Shelton Collier.

After sweeping Connecticut
aside in three games on Friday
morning, the Lady Panthers di-
sposed of Boston College in the
afternoon three games to one. On‘
Saturday, Pitt continued its
mastery by sweeping Providence
and Syracuse. Due to a new tour-

nament format, Pitt met Provi- »
dence in a fateful rematch on .

Sunday in the semi-finals.
Several Lady Panthers stood
out in defeat. Louise O’Shaugh-‘
-nessy (161 assists), Lisa Stewart
(51 kills) and Denise Frawley (48

kills) were named to the All-

Tourna'ment‘team., Additionally,
Noreen Coughlin performed ad-
mirably, leadingthe team in kills
(67) as well as blocks (15) in the
tournament.

Several Pitt players were re-
warded for their season long ef-
forts. Denise Frawley, the Lady
Panthers’ juniorloutside hitter
was named Big East Player of the
Year while setterjenelle Lantagne
was chosen as the conference's
top freshman. On the strength of
leading Pitt to a 37-5 record, Shel-
ton‘ Collier was chosen as the

things, and I saw some things that
I wasn't too pleased with. We
have to iron outthe kinks.”

In the latest national rankings,
Pitt's Santoro is ranked No. 1 at
the 142 weight class. In the final

_ match of the weekend, Santoro

was slated to face off against the
No. 2-ranked 142.-pounder Mike
Cole of Clarion University.»

The match started off fast and

furious as both wrestlerslooked

cross-town rival Robert Morris.
Game time is 8 p.m.

The injury occurred when
freshman guard Darelle Porter
and Brookin were fighting for po-
sition in the lane.

”I was trying to box [Rod] out,
and he tried to spin on me. His
arm got caught with my arm, and
I think his weight [Brookin
weighs around 230 pounds]
pulled his shoulder out of the
socket. Rod's weight was going
one way, and his shoulder was
going the other way,” said Porter.

Brookin fell to the ground cry-
ing in pain and was escorted off
the court by Pitt trainer Tony Sale-
si. Salesi was able to get
Brookin’s arm popped back into

place.

Brookin was taken to Pres-
byterian University Hospital last
night for x—rays.

Presbyterian would not release
the results of those x—rays.

Brookin averaged 10.2 points
and 4.0 rebounds per game last
year and was expected to start
this season at small fon/vard.

The Panthers have been select-
ed by the Big East coaches to fin-
ish first in the conference this
year, but Evans’ squad has its
share of problems entering the
season.

In addition to Brookin’s injury,

Gore missed the first three weeks

up to the challenge. Unfortunat-
ly, with the scored tied 2-2 in the
first period, Cole popped his el-
bow and couldn't continue. San-
toro won by default.

”Pat looked really good
throughout the whole weekend,”
said Stottlemyer. ’’It was a shame
that the final match had tobe

Stottlemyer also said that fresh-

heavyweight John Owens both

’’I don't know what's wrong.

Bruce

By Matt Martin

Staff Writer .

With the help of what could be
the best recruiting class ever at
Pitt, the Lady Panthers basketball

' squad seems ready to turn last

year's disappointing 7-21 record

_ around and make their run at the

Big East Championship.

For the first time in two years,
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
returns three starters —— Sally
Sheerer, Tabatha Long and Jen-
nifer Shingler. But with the talent
Bruce has recruited, it may be-
come difficult to tell the veterans
from the newcomers.

With the graduation of Patricia
Paul and Pam Novosel, Bruce
and the Lady Panthers werein
dire need of a center. They came
through with Connie Hurt, a
6-foot—4 freshman from Penn

’ Hills High School. Hurt was a first

team All—State selection last year
as well as Quad—A Player of the
Year, averaging 18 points and 12
rebounds a game. Bruce said
Hurt has ”potential,dripping off
her — she could someday be the
best center in the Big East.”
Hurt was chosen as a presea-
son, first-team All-Freshman
selection in the ‘conference.
Another welcome addition will
be the tandem of Denise Becher

and Deidra Baker, both transfers ,

schools. 6
This weekend Pitt travels to the
Lock Haven Invitational.

”These tournaments are very
important to the team,” said Stott-
lemyer. ”Everybody gets much-
needed experience. This
weekend at Lock Haven will bé
another tough one. There are go-j
ing to be a lot of good wrestlers
there. I'm confident that our guys
will give aigood Sl’)nwino...” "

Lane at the forward spots and
senior Charles Smith at center.

_Evans said Pitt's other alterna-
tive would be to start Gore in

place of Porter at small forward.

Gore has been slow to recover
from his ankle injury, but Evans
said he's practiced very well four
of the last five days.

No matter which lineup Evans
chooses, he'll have to play a lot
of new players as the Panthers try
to survive their rugged pre-Big
East schedule.

Evans will need the services of
two other freshman. Sean Miller
will back up Cavanuagh at point
guard, and forward Bobby Mar-
tin will be the first man off the
bench should Lane or Smith get
into foul trouble.

Porter, for one, likes the oppor-
tunity to get some more playing
time early in the season. ’’I need
experience before we get into the
[Big East] season,” he said.

Brookin’s absence probably
wouldn't affect Pitt in its first
three games (Robert Morris, St.
Francis and Chicago State), but if
he's lost for a long period of time,
the Panthers would feel it.

Pitt plays five straight games on
the road from Dec. 12 to Dec. 29.
The Panthers play West Virginia,
Akron, Jacksonville, Florida State
in the Citrus Bowl Tournament
and either Alabama or Central
Florida in the next round of the
tournament.

Pitt will play at home against
Florida Jan. 2 before opening the
Big East season at Georgetown
Jan. 6.

The men's and women's swim
teams were on the road last
weekend; the women took on
Virginia and Villanova while the
men took on Marshall College.

The women lost to the nation-
ally ranked Lady Cavaliers
148-1 1 7.

Pitt's Judy Haughton won the
200-yard butterfly, and diver
Tricia Ney won the 1-meter div-
ing. Ney qualified for the NCAA
preliminaries.

”They won, but we were real-
ly competitive in every event,”
said women's coach Dave Be-
lowich. ”This is good because it
helped our -freshman become
better Division I swimmers.

”Even though we lost, good
things can come from a loss. It's
our philosophy when swimming
—- do the best you can, win, lose
or draw,” he added.

On Saturday, the women came
back to beat Villanova 151-103.

The highlight of the weekend
was when sophomore Sandy Al-

THE PITINEWS, Tuesday, November 24, 1987

Swim teams find success

bright qualified for the NCAA
championships to be held in
Austin, Texas, in March.

Albright qualified with a time
of 57.61 - setting a school
record, a pool record and com-
ing within a few tenths of a sec-
ond from the Olympic trial cuts.

”To have this opportunity so far
in advance to know she's already
made NCAAs and can concen-
trate on her performance there in-
stead of getting there; it's ideal 
the earlier, the better,” said Be-
lowich.

Belowich was pleased with the
performances of sophomore
Laure Walczak and freshman Liz

‘Sari, but he was especially

pleased with his seniors. Haugh-
ton and Ney along with Marian

Cassidy and Cindy Rose are_

showing what Belowich expects
from his seniors — leadership by
example.

Belowich also stresses the im-
portance of his staff: assistant
coach Mary Bolich and diving
coach Julian Krug. ’’I believe
you're only as good as the peo-
ple under you,” said Belowich.

”We’re 5-1,” said Belowich.
”We’d like to be undefeated, but
sometimes a loss is good. It
makes you hungry.”

The men's team defeated Mar-
shall by a score of 122-54. Pitt
won all but one event.

Junior Dan Langan won the

500- and 1,000-yard freestyles,
and according to assistant coach
Bob Clemmer, he is swimming
his seasonal best right now.
Charlie Fry won the 200-yard
freestyle. .
' Sophomore Tim Adams won
the 50-yard freestyle and the
200-yard backstroke. Junior Scott
Jeffries won the 100-yard
freestyle.

Senior Jim Emore took first in
the 200-yard butterfly, and Mark
Dombroski won the 200-yard
breaststroke. .

Chris Blair won the 1- and
3-meter diving competition.

Clemmer feels the team's work
habits are improving. ”They
weren't used to the new coaches,

 but they're starting to look better

and swim better.”

Freshman

Continued from page 9
Hamburg, N.Y. Baker, a 5-foot-9
small forward, averaged 17
points and seven rebounds last
year. She was named first-team,
Junior College AlI—American and
Region III Player of the Year.

Bruce said Baker, a strong re-
bounder and scorer, brings out

_ the best in other players. "The

players respond to her talent,”
said Bruce.

Becher, a 5—foot-7 point guard,
”is a good outside shooter and
runs the floor well,” said Bruce.
Her experience with Baker
should prove to be a definite as-
set to the Lady Panthers this year.

Holly Holmes, a 5-foot-10
freshman from Toledo, Ohio, will
fill in at the forward spot. Holmes
averaged 15 points and seven re-
bounds a game at Notre Dame

the type of player that will always
help you — never hurt you. She's
that kind of player,” Bruce said.
Holmes shoots and runs the floor
well, and she said her father, who
played under Al McGuire at Mar-
quette, ”he|ps tremendously —
he's always teaching me
something.”

Whitney Mack, a 5-foot-9 fresh-
man from Shawnee High School
in Springfield, Ohio, will also fill
in at forward. Mack averaged 14
points and six rebounds a game
last year. Bruce calls Mack a
”great all-around athlete.” Mack
is very quick and has excellent
jumping ability.

knee surgery was like ”sitting out.

and gained a lot of weight. My

I still have to give 100 percent.”

Despite her troubled knees,
Johnson was a second—team All-
Freshman selection in the con-
ference. -

”Other teams in the Big East
don't know what we have yet,”
Denise Becher said. "

Should any of the teams in the
league underestimate the Lady
Panthers, then it wouldn't be sur-
prising to see Pitt near the top of
the Big East come March.
