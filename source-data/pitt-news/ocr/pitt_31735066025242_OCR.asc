Brennan, Student Government clash over responsibility

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

A female Pitt student was raped in a
wooded area off University Drive early
Sunday morning after leaving a party at
the Sigma Chi fraternity house, according
to Pitt campus police.

The victim was jogging home alone
after the taxi she called did not show up.
According to campus police, a male suspect
grabbed the woman from behind, held
both of her arms and pulled her to the
hillside. He asked her for money, covered
her face and then raped her. The victim

flagged a taxi down and was taken home,
where she called the Pittsburgh police,
who are handling the investigation.

The campus police sent an officer to her
home after being notified by Pittsburgh
police, but at this time they are not involved
in the investigation. The woman was taken
to a local Pittsburgh hospital.

The battle between the Student

Government Board and the Department ‘

of Public Safety has once again become
heated, as students demand answers about
the lack of security on campus and in the
surrounding Oakland area-.

“.[William Brennan, director of public

safety] has lied to us. We feel cheated and
used. He lied about the number of officers.
He gave us the run around in getting crime
reports, and he dragged his feet on the
van-call issue,” Student Government Board
and Presidential Safety Task Force member
Jacob Brody said.

“After the first [sexual assault] in
November, Brennan did not do a thing to
keep this from occurring again. I did not
see any new ideas coming out of the
public-safety department. It was business
as usual, and business as usual sucks,"
Brody said. I '

,‘‘What can you say? This is pathetic. I

could have said this was going to happen
again after it happened the last time. After
all the pressure in the world we got them
to cooperate with this van-call," SGB
President Gil Golden said.‘

“Why do we have to think of everything?
Why do we, the students, have to put
pressure on them to do something about
safety?” Golden questioned.

Brennan, however, said he disagrees

with Golden's accusations. _ .

“lThe SGB] comes in asking for
something, and we bend over backward
to get it for them,” Brennan said. “We did

Israeli prof says Dead Sea Scrolls important link to past

By Kim Palrniero

of the Scrolls.

Staﬂ" Writer

The Dead Sea Scrolls shed important
light on the Christian origins of the biblical
text and the lives of ancient peoples,
according to Dr. Jonas Greenfield, a
professor of Semitic languages at Hebrew
University in Israel.

“Publish or Perish: New Life for the
Dead Sea Scrolls” was the title of yesterday's
lecture by Greenfield, which was

 sponsored ‘by the Jewish-studies

department. Greenfield has published
several documents regarding the content

The Scrolls, which were found near

Jerusalem, are a group of over 800
documents written and copied by early
Christian scholars. Carbon dating shows
the Scrolls were written between the
periods of 200 B.C. and S0 B.C. Many of
the documents, written in both Greek and
Hebrew, comprise what are today parts of
the Bible.
S Greenﬁeld jokingly called attention to
sensationalism surrounding the content of
the Scrolls,’ holding up the headlines
of different tabloids to prove his
point. 

“We see here that the same tabloid that
gave us Gennifer Flowers tells us that the
Dead Sea Scrolls contain a cure for AIDS.”
Other popular claims speculate that the
Scrolls contairT the cure for cancer and say
that Elvis is alive.

Greenﬁeld explained that the Scrolls.

were excavated from 11 caves during the
early part of the century, and since then
have been the cause of both conﬂict and
controversy.

He said that when Israel ‘took over
Jerusalem, one important document, the

Temple Scroll, was seized by the Israeli

government. A

According the Greenfield, Israeli police
came to the home of the scholar who

owned the Temple Scroll and dug it up in’

his back yard, where the scholar had

hidden it.
“There was more damage done to the

Temple Scroll in that one day than in the V
2,000—plus years it had been sitting in the '

cave,” Greenfield said.

Among those important documents are
several books which talk clearly about the
life and customs of the people. One such
book is The Communal Rule, which

Coping on Campus

Living well now best predictor of future success

Many students that I speak with
talk of their concern that life has

' no focus or meaning for them.

Some express the hope that things
will come together for them “some
day,” while others have a
pervasive fear that they will never
achieve success or gain a clear
sense of direction.

Forming a plan on how _to lead
one’s life is not easy. First, there
is no one, “correct” way to
construct such a plan. Second,
there are often no role models or
examples available to guide us.
And third, many obstacles and
setbacks, both foreseen and
unforeseen, will inevitably arise
during the pursuit of our plans.

It is also a continuous challenge
to balance our focus on “process”
(living in the present) with our
focus on “product" (our future
goal). Some students charge
ahead with their lives with no
plans at all, while others become
so focused on their future that

lllllllllll

 

Gallagher .

they fail to pay attention to their
present quality of life. Setting
goals is important. We need to
dream our dreams and work to
achieve them. However we create
what we are to become by paying
attention to the wayrwe live as we
move toward our goals.

  

To lead successful lives, we
also need to define for ourselves
what we mean by success. For
Ralph Waldo Emerson, a
successful person is one “who
has lived well, laughed often and
loved much; who has gained the
respect of intelligent people; who
leaves the world a bit better; 
and who knows that even one
person has breathed easier
because he or she has lived.”

These words may seem a little
fanciful, but I think that most of
us can relate to at least some of
Emerson's beliefs. Almost
everyone, I think, wants to lead a
life that matters. What we need to
learn, however, is that we can’t
wait for sometime in the future
for this kind of life to suddenly
emerge. We need to make our
lives matter today.

How do we do this? Bookstores
are full of self—help books that
purport to give answers. Many of
these books, however, seem to

focus on how to polish our
personality (i.e. how to become a
better conversationalist, how to
make people like us or how to
make ourselves better). While
some of these ideas can be
helpful, a more useful way of
insuring both a successful and
satisfying future is by building
character as well as personality.

Every time we make choices
that affirm us and people around
us, we increase the meaning of
our life. Every time we take our
work seriously, act with courage,
help a friend, speak up for what
we believe in, refine our talents,
love someone, treat our Earth
with respect or just exalt in being
alive, we take a step toward a life
that means something.

Planning for our future is an
essential ingredient of success,
but living well now is the best
guarantee we have of developing
a future we can embrace with
pride.

Playboy back at Pitt
to search for models

By Scott Nespor
Staﬂ“ Writer

Playboy magazine has had some good luck with the women
of Pitt and is on campus this week to recruit for its back—to-
school issue featuring the girls of the Big East college-football
conference, photographer David Chan said.

The issue, due for release in October, will feature not only the
women but Playboys 10All-American defensive players, 10All-
American offensive players, the PlayboyCoach of the Year, and
a list of the top American college—football teams.

‘‘[The issue} is packed full of information,” Chan said.

Chan is interviewing potential women who would like to
appear in the magazine. He said the only qualifications are that
the woman be at least 18 years of age, a Pitt student and that
she “feels good about herself.”

The application does specify a woman list her measurements,
but Chan said they are not the deciding factor.

While Chan said he is not looking for the ideal beauty queen,
Playboy does use this search to find future models,
actresses and possibly a Playmate (the banner centerfold
model).

Chan said he hopes the search will produce a good “cross—
section»of the college community.”

Between 100-200 women are expected to be interviewed.

The women who are chosen will be notified within a month,
Chan said. Of the final 20 who will be featured, there will be
about three or four women selected from Pitt. On the application
the interviewee is asked whether or not she is willing to pose
nude. If the woman opts not to pose in the buff, then her picture
will be taken within a group of women.

Polit developed a theme for his
entire performance. Polit played
the theme from the Godfather,
Speak Softly Love, on the piano,
and he was accompanied by
members of his fraternity dressed
up as hitrnen for the toga part of
the competition.

“We decided to play a song
that could be integrated into a
theme. The title of my song has
been incorporated in both the
toga and talent [part of the
competition]. I’ve never seen
someone have a toga related to
their talent,” Polit said.

Two pseudo trumpeters
mimicked a fanfare for Christoff
as she came on stage for the toga
competition. Christoff than
boogied to Burn Baby Burn. For
the talent part of the competition,

participation.

The toga was worth 30 percent
of the competition and was judged
on the toga, performance, and

The women from Pitt are really nice to work with, Chansaid,
because they do not live in a really big‘ metropolis, like Miami.

GSPA to hold elections

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

The Graduate and Professional
Student Association will be
holding elections in the William
Pitt Union on March 25.

GPSA President Steve Parks said
the GPSA has the potential to
really front graduate issues on
campus and that is why it is
important that all graduate
students vote.

“By having a popularly elected
president, there is more authority
with the students,” Parks said.

As a whole the, GPSA will be
looking to begin a Graduate and
Professional Gay and Lesbian

Association, health-care beneﬁts
for TAs, child care and a graduate
program for international
students.

Parks said that since GPSA is
not as established, a huge turnout
is not expected, but hopefully
the next election will get more of
a response.

Along with the election, GPSA
will be conducting a survey on
what graduate students think the
GPSA needs to work on.

“If undergraduate students
would go on strike, professors
would have a day off. If graduate
students went on strike, the
university would shut down,”
Parks said.

Editor deﬁnes gender

By John Temple
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

Although it is good that
feminists have been largely
successful in replacing the word
“sex” with “gender,” they need to
examine the connotations of the
word more closely, according to
Linda Nicholson, a professor at
the State University of New York
and editor of the Feminism/
Postmodernism publication.

Nicholson, who authored the
book Gender in Ilistoryin 1986,
spoke yesterday at Pitt.

Her lecture was based on the
first chapter of her upcoming
book, The Genealogy of Gender.

'I‘he‘word “sex," when used to

identify masculinity or femininity,
has biological connotations that
are misleading, Nicholson said.
But the accepted feminist
definition of gender is too
overgeneralized and univers-
alized, and it, too, needs to be
reconsidered.

“Most feminists would define
gender as, ‘the social construction
of the male/female distinction,”
Nicholson said.

This is too generalized because
it does not explain what the
construction is, and the
constructions differ from culture
to culture. Also, this definition
tends to make people attribute
Western constructions of the word
to other cultures, Nicholson said.

Professor works to personalize

treatment ofmerztozlly illpoztients  

By Robyn Petrella
sqgwwwr

Psychiatric Professor Horacio Fabrega works
to eliminate the highly mechanical and impersonal
ways of treating the mentally ill.

His research is based on social, cultural,
historical and philosophical aspects of mental
disease. In addition, he concentrates on the
cultural adversities connected with the diagnosis
and treatment of psychiatric patients. Fabrega
said the treatment and study of mentally ill
patients has changed dramatically over the past
30 years. A '

Fabrega also administers psychiatric education
to medical students at Pitt. He plans and directs
third-year medical students who have six-week
clerkships on various floors. In addition, he
lectures to these students on the neuroscientific
basis of psychiatry.

Fabrega said psychiatry carries biases associated
with it from the past. He said he works to
overcome these reservations associated with the

profession.

Medical students are made aware of the
scientific basis as well as the doctor-patient
relationship involved with psychiatry. These
concepts are taught in the clerkships. Each
student is assigned to a different ward and
placed in a treatment team. They treat eight to 10
patients on a day—to-day basis and provide ease
conferences to be reviewed by Fabrega once a
week. In this respect the medical student gets a
humanistic view of psychiatric patients instead
of just a clinical perspective.

Fabrega is also a professor of anthropology,
which might explain his interest in this association.
The different societies he researches show that
culture plays a significant role in the treatment of
mental illness. All societies have different beliefs
and different ways of treating it. Fabrega ascribes
to the cultural connection between mental illness
and the environment.

Fabrega said he feels that while mental illness
is treated differently in different societies, we can
benefit from rudimentary ways of treatment.

said. “This is not a course on
hitting and striking alone. It also
develops your wit." .

During the 15-week course,
students learn verbal skills,
confrontational _ subject
management, pressure point
control, observational skills,
psychology of walking and how
to avoid sex offenses.

Students will also be given
simulation drills. Smith will plant
people in the streets of Oakland
to test the student's observational
skills. _

Having responsibilities in two different

countries doesn’t hinder Dr. Lawrence

Feick, Associate Dean of The Joseph M.
Katz Graduate School of Business. Instead

A it motivates him.

Feick, who came to Pitt in 1982 as an

‘assistant professor of business, became
- the associate dean in 1988,’much to his
-surprise.

“I had administration thrust upon me,”

“Feick said. “I never applied for the job. It
was an. opportunity to find out about

myself that I never had before.”

As an associate dean, Feick has internal
responsibilities such as faculty recruiting,
admission and placement. He also works
with the directors of undergradu ate master's
and doctoral programs.

“The variety is interesting and re warding.
This position has many more characteristics
of a manager of a firm than a traditional

University coordinator aids student athletes

faculty position would,” Feick said. “That’s
been fun for me to work on the
interpersonal side.”

In addition to responsibilities at Pitt,
Feick is also responsible for two centers in
Europe and their relationship to Pitt.

“The school has affiliated centers in

Budapest and Prague,” Feick..said, The .

International Management Center, and
the Czechoslovakia Management Center
offer students the opportunity to take
two—thirds of their MBA coursework there
and finish here.

Due to his work with CMC and IMC,
Feick travels extensively. In the fall of
1990 he taught at IMC, as well as carried
out administrative duties at both IMC and
CMC. Since 1989 he has also worked on
three research projects that “came about
as a natural experiment that is occurring
in that part of the world as the environment
Changes.”

“My interest in that part of the world has
come about because I've taught over

there, and I'm responsible for
understanding what's going on,” Feick
said. “It’s very interesting intellectually."
Aside from his concerns in Europe,
Feick is interested in implementing an
undergraduate business school at Pitt. He
has presented a proposal for this to Pitt.
1 “The proposal is motivated by our felt
need to work to improve the programs

that we offer,” Feick said. “The programs .

in CAS and CGS are good programs but
need modifications to bring them up-to-
date. The proposal is to have an
undergraduate business school which
would offer undergraduate business
degrees. I think that it makes sense for the
institution.” «
. The son of an English war bride and
American soldier in.World War II, Feick
was born in Berlin, Germany. Being “pro-
American,” his father moved his family
back to the states when his son was just a
toddler.

His father became a minister, and Feick

grew up mainly in Pennsylvania and
Delaware before ﬁnally settling in the
Pittsburgh area. He received his education
from the University of Delaware with a
B.A. in Psychology and an M.S. in
Agricultural Economics. He became “Dr.
Feick” at Penn State, where he also studied
Agricultural Economics.

When time permits, Feick said he enjoys
running. “Running is a good sport when
you don’t have a lot of time, but now I’m
old and my knees are creaky,” Feick
joked.

joking aside, Dr. Feick -said he enjoys
his work at Pitt. “I ’m really pleased and I’m
really fortunate that I got the opportunity
to take on the job.”

“This is my first ‘real’ academic job. I
taught for a year at a large state-related
institution in central Pennsylvania,” Feick
said as he breaks into laughter. (That is a
dignified way of referring to Penn State!)
“I have undivided loyalties to [Pitt]. I never
have problems_in the Pitt—Penn State game!”

But Brody, who co-designed the
van-call system, said he views the
situation differently.

“We had to ﬁght tooth and nail for
that van-call system because it's a
service for the students and [Brennan]
could not see how we needed it,”
Brody said.

Brody also. cited other situations in
which the SGB had to use pressure to
upgrade campus security.

“We had to push the office for three

weeks before he gave us crime re parts.
We had to press him for a month for
a van-call. He should be giving these
to us because he wants to, not has to,”
Brody said.

Golden cited three safety problems
on campus. First, he blamed the state
for cutting the budget. Secondly, he
found fault with the Department of
Public Safety. Third is lack of education
and poor judgement on the part of
students.

“I haven’t seen [Public Safety] do
anything we haven’t pressured them
to do. We aren’t the experts; they are,”

But Brennan said he believes the

"We’ve been very responsive. I don't
know what [Golden] is talking about.
We work very closely with the SGB
and have done some positive things
and will continue to do so. If [Golden]
feels that way, I wish he would come
in and tell me,” Brennan said.

Rather than wonder what to do or
not to do, Golden said he is in favor
of looking to outside sources to assist
the university’s safety program and
make recommendations. “If we don't
have the solutions to what we can do
about these problems, we need to get

Golden also addressed the fact that

the budget for the Department of
Public Safety.

“Why aren't we begging for money

ideology of the community. Speciﬁc offenses
such as spitting are referred to, Greenﬁeld said.

“To spit in’ public is a very serious act It was i ’

considered very unsanitary.”

Also in The Communal Rule is reﬂected the
importance of immersion in water. ‘llmmersion
in water] was considered to be a symbol of the
cleansing of both the body and of the mindand
to induce pure thoughts,‘ Greenﬁeld said.

Besides the allusions to what today has
evolved into the sacrament of baptism for many
Christians, another document talks about the
battle between good and evil. The Rule of War,

Greenﬁeld said, ‘speaks about the war between ' -

light and darkness. It is an apocalyptic work,
which alludes to the nearing of the end of the
world.”

Nor were the lives of the kings and speciﬁc
rules concerning the proper role and behavior of
a king excluded from the pens of ancient scholars.

The Temple Scroll referred to plans for how a T

temple should be built, the proper rituals of
particular holidays and proper modes of kingly
behavior.

“Kings were expected to follow a strict code

of conduct, which included a limit on the number '

of wives he could have. Polygamy was not
permitted for the king,” Greenfield said.

Diversity undermined

,‘ Declining enrollment of African-American and Latino/
Hispanic students at Penn State University should not
come as a surprise. Racial division continues to mar the

supposedly tranquil and culturally diverse life on American
university campuses. _

\ On March 20, Dr.john Brighton, executive vice president
and .provost, announced, “Baccalaureate degree
applications are up by about 2 percent: 36,187 this year
versus 35,562 for last year. Overall applications to date are
at about the same level as they were last year, which is
good news, considering the declining pool of high—school
graduates.”

However applications to date show a decrease by 9
percent for African-American potential students — 1,219
this year as compared to last year’s 1,346 applications. A
similar drop has been recorded for Latino/Hispanic
applicants. Applications are down 6 percent —— 760 last
year but only 711 for the upcoming academic year.
Brighton was quick to point out in his report to Penn
State’s Board of Trustees that the admissions process is
only two-thirds of the way completed and these findings
may only be preliminary.

Unfortunately, the drop reflects a growing gulf along
racial lines in the United States. Through programs to
retain minority students, Penn State's main campus is
attempting to increase the black-student population above

 
  

’ /.55

. _. /X /
" ' 5 //'5".
1 .r'

     

e the current 3.2-percent level.

Campus environment may contribute to the effect or
possibly a declining base of college-bound high—school
seniors for communities of color. (At the University of

at 9 percent.) -

Brighton stated, “Early minority admissions figures for
Pennsylvanians are also encouraging. The number of

baccalaureate-degree applications from Pennsylvania
residents for all minority groups has increased by 8
percent over 1991. However there has been a significant
decline in out-of-state applications.”

While it may be the case that in-state minority figures are
“encouraging,” it is clear higher education cannot live up
to the “cultural diversity” expectations espoused in the
'90s.

In his report to the Board of Trustees, Brighton noted
campus environment, location and race relations were
minor factors for minorities.

, This may be true, but it is doubtful. Campus environment
will affect recruitment of minority students. Happy Valley
can be perceived as a white enclave.

Campus programming addressing Penn State’s cultural
homogeneity is supposedly working to create an inclusive
campus. But these programs, even with all the best
intentions, will not be able to fix the overt and covert
racism permeating American life.

When our parents were _
growing up, red meat and dairy products were the
staple of their diet. Protein was vital, while dairy
products provided the calcium for strong bones.
Today any nutritionist will tell you that red meat
may not be the best source of protein. Dairy
products high in fat and cholesterol may be doing
more harm than good. .

As more and more middle—aged Americans
undergo heart surgery (Americans have the highest
rate of heart attacks in the world), I shudder to think
what science may tell me about my “healthy" diet
in the future.

A recent article in Science magazine runs through
an insurmountable amount of formulas and

does not say much for more complex sciences.
This is not to say science is useless. Advancements

in this century alone have had a major, positive

impact on all of us. The problem is in thegross

inconsistencies that have arisen over the past 

couple of decades. Science cannot even tell me, ‘
accurately, what is beneﬁcial for the human body.
Progress is as unavoidable as time itself. Maybe
the fallacies of modern-day science are steps of
progression, but maybe the justification for progress
is blind faith, which is nothing more than superstition.

Philosophy Club explains anti-gay stand ..

This letter addresses the issue

of the philosophy club and sexual .

orientation. We do not intend to
carry through with a ban of
homosexuals and bisexuals. This
action was designed to make this
campus more aware of the
possible consequences of an
impotent policy.

The university promises that it
will not discriminate on the basis
of, among other things, sexual
orientation. This is a secret to no
one. That the Army’ ROTC
program, in its affiliation with
Pitt, does discriminate is also no
secret. ROTC, as an educational
program, receives benefits and
privileges at Pitt. Therefore, this

approach to the issue. This has
the effect of saying, “Pitt does not

this promise of fair treatment. To
be sure, the SGB can (and should)
cut off any group, including ours,
that discriminates. Yet without
an effective, binding (for everyone
in the university) non-
discrimination policy, such an
action would be an arbitrary
decision of any given board. Such
a policy is instituted so that we do
not have to make sure that non-
discrimination coincides with the
particular agendas and
convenience of our chosen
ofﬁcials. A non—discrimination
policy should not be blithely set
aside.

Panthers bow to Flo

By Derek Willis

Sports Editor

As usual, it all came down to Sean Miller.

Trailing Florida by three with four seconds
remaining, Pitt gave the ball to its senior
captain, and Miller drove past halfcourt,
leaned in and let ﬂy a 55-foot shot. A hushed
Fitzgerald Field House crowd watched as the
ball careened harmlessly off the rim, and
Pitt’s season ended with a 77-74 loss to
Florida in the second round of the National
Invitation Tournament.

Stacey Poole and Craig Brown led the 18-
12 Gators with 17 points apiece, while Chris
McNeal ﬁnished his junior campaign with
another strong performance, scoring a game-
high 19 points. Miller had three points and six
assists in‘ his final game, and fellow senior
Darren Morningstar netted 18 and eight
boards. A

The game was a classic‘ example of two
very different teams: Pitt (18-16) enjoyed
overwhelming dominance inside, while
Florida had the quick perimeter athletes; The
two disparate styles produced a tight game
throughout, as the largest margin came in the
first half, when the Gators led 21-14.

“I think it was an awfully interesting
basketball game,” said Florida head coach
Lon Kruger. “Their size combined with Sean's
ability to get the ball inside really made it
tough on us.” ‘

Indeed, Pitt outrebounded Florida, 44-30,
and grabbed 18 offensive boards to the
Gators’ eight. But the biggest factor was the

-2-3 zone defense of Florida, which cut down

on the Panthers’ inside game.

 -“-We were killing them inside,” Miller said, v-

“and they made a good, adjustment by
switching to the zone. We struggled when
they did that. We haven't seen a zone for a
while.”

“We probably played as much zone ‘tonight
as we have all year combined,” Kruger said.

With their inside game cut down by the
zone, the Panthers looked to the perimeter
for offensive punch but found little, with the
exception ofjerry McCullough. The first-year
guard scored 12 points, including two three-
pointers, but he was the only outside player
who scored in double figures. Fifty-two of
Pitt’s points came from the paint, as Eric

_ Mobley had nine and Chris Gant scored six,

while providing phonebooth defense on Poole
in the second half. The Florida star had just
four points after halftime.

In addition to the troubles on the offensive
end, the Panthers had matchup problems
defensively against the quicker Gators. Poole,

For The Pitt News

“I haven't even told my best friend,”
Susie Slam said. “I don’t want her to think
anything less of me, so I haven’t told
her.”

What Susie has not told her friend is
that she is a pudding wrestler.

Susie (not her real name) is a 19-year-
old sophomore at the University of
Pittsburgh who started pudding wrestling
for the money. She receives $80 to put on
‘a show that lasts about 10 minutes.

Susie, who also dances (fully clothed)
for a prominent dance company in the
Pittsburgh area, was contacted by a
representative of the World Pudding
Wrestling Federation while at a dance
practice, rehearsing her routine.

‘At first I said no because I thought it
was disgusting and dirty,” she said with
a laugh. “But then he let me watch a
videotape, and it looked like fun and the
money was good, so I did it”

Susie has been pudding wrestling for
eight months. She puts" on a show
approximately once a month and said
she looks forward to it, but not only for

'13.; -

4“I have a great time doing it,” she said,
slightly embarrassed. “T hat’s why I do it;
it’s fun. It doesn’t turn me on. It’s just that
I know that all of these guys paid money
to come and see me. It’s exciting to have
all these guys that you don’t even know
yelling for you. But I don’t want it to
sound like a sleazy job because it’s not.”

Susie has a wide range of talents. She
has been acting since she was four years
old and dancing since she was three.

“The _money’s better wrestling, but I
enjoy dancing more, probably because
I’ve been doing it for so much longer,”
she said.

She also models clothing in her spare g

time. Susie said she wants to do some
modeling work on the side after she
graduates. '

Susie is a communications major at Pitt,
after changing from the pre-pharmacy
track. She transferred from the Pitt-
Johnstown campus last semester but said
she does not really like the “big city”
atmosphere at the University of Pittsburgh.

here.”

Susie said people think she is dumb
when she tells them that she pudding
wrestles.

“A lot of the guys that I tell talk to me_
like I’m a ditz,” she said.

Susie, however, had a 4.0 QPA last
semester, and she carries a cumulative
QPA of 3.85.

She also works as a salesperson at a
men’s clothing store in Century Three
Mall. But one night a month she cuts
loose and puts on a show.

The show is scheduled to start at 10
p.m., and Susie arrives by 9:15 p.m. She
gets ready with the other seven girls in
the show, all of whom are older than she
is. Susie is the only wrestler in the group _
who is under 21. Several of the girls are
married and have children.

“We all get along, but we're not real
close friends," she said. “But when you’re
out there wrestling, you have to act like
you don’t get along. You have to" act

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 24, 1992

Brown balances studies and the beam

Byjohn Labriola
saw Writer

One of Pitt’s unique athletes
can be found daily behind a
chain-link fence in Trees Hall.
She's not an escapee from
Western Psych. She does get
spastic at times and “wigs out”
occasionally, but she is safe —
sometimes.

Kristin Brown, co-captain of
Pitt’s women’s gymnastics team,
performs her routines daily in the
caged practice area in Trees
Hall's large gym. Brown, a native
of Clairton, Pa., joined the Lady
Panthers’ lineup three years ago
after taking her father's advice

-about giving Pitt a chance.

“I was offered a scholarship,
and it was close to home,” Brown
said. “I liked the coaches and the
team."

According to Brown,’she started
late with gymnastics. At the age
of nine her mother enrolled her
in a gymnastics school.

~“In third grade our school
district went on strike until
October,” Brown said. "I was
bouncing off the walls and my
mother wanted me out of the
house, so she went through the
yellow pages and found a
gymnastics school and sent me
there.”

Brown’s career at Pitt has been
one success after another. During
her first season, she became one
of Pitt’s top all—around

icornpetitors, compiling an
average score of57. ‘I and scoring

a season high of 37.15 against
Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania.Also during her rookie
campaign she captured the United
States Gymnastics Federation's
regional and state beam champion
title.

The following season Brown

‘ proved she was not just a morning

glory by continuing to turn in
outstanding performances as a
sophomore at Pitt. She averaged
36.689 points and tallied a season
high 37.55.Brown said she
attributes a great deal of her
success in college to the coaching
staff at Pitt. She said she feels that
her relationship with head coach
Debbie Yohman is a steadying
one.

“She keeps me in line when I
getspastic,” Brown said, “because
I havea tendency to wig out
every once in a while.

Brown claims that, under
Yohman’s guidance, she has been
able to develop her gymnastic
skills to the collegiate level.

“College gymnastics is
completely different from club,”
Brown said. “You have to have
class to compete as a college
gymnast.”

During her career at Pitt, Brown
has been working in the all-
around event, which means that
for every meet she competes in
all four events: vault, uneven
parallel bars, balance beam and
floor. Out of these four events,
Brown is torn over which is her
favorite.

‘'1 love both floor and bars,”

Brown said. “I can't decide on,

one because on bars you swing
and it’s fun, and on floor it’s fast-
moving and wild, flipping all
over the place.”

She said she feels the latter two
events, beam and vault, are the
ones that she has the most trouble
with, although this seems strange
because Brown held the school’s
beam record for two years.

“Beam is just hard in general,
and I don’t like beam,” Brown
said. “On beam everything has to
be really precise. On bars you
can wiggle your way through it,
but with beam you have to be on
and have concentration.”

Brown will be the first to tell
you where her skills in gymnastics
are lacking.

She says the vaulting event is
her worst event. Brown said the
gymnastics schools she attended
did not teach the correct form for
vaulting.

“They never really taught you
how to block correctly and do
tsuks correctly,” Brown said.

Brown said she feels it has
been a good thing that she started
out late in gymnastics because
many of the girls that she began
with have left the sport.She said
since coming to Pitt her routines
have improved because she has
been able to work out more
difficult tricks.

“I haven’t slacked off since I've
gotten here,” Brown said. “My
routines have gotten continually
better— not by leaps and bounds,
but have been polished off.”

There are several things that
Brown said she is proud of about
her Pitt career. The first was
obtaining her scholarship, which
became a goal of hers as she
advanced into a higher level of
gymnastics.Her second proud
moment came when her
teammates voted her to be
their co-captain.

“I feel flattered that they chose
me,” Brown said. “I was so
overwhelmed. It was the nicest
thing that anyone had ever done
for me.”

The third thing that brings a
smile to her face is her future
plans.

“I’m getting married in August
of '95,” Brown said. “I want to
take my fifth year to get my
teaching certiﬁcate for secondary
education.”

Brown said she wants to
upgrade all of her routines with
new tricks. She said that she will
get a vault. She is looking forward
to her senior season and hopes
for the best.

“Everyone wants to have a
good season, but whether I do or
not I want to have fun. I want to
go out happy,” Brown said. » ’

One of Brown’s characteristics
is that she always smiles during
her routines.

“If you catch me smiling after a
fall, its for show,” Brown said.

“If you catch me smiling and I
haven’t fallen, that’s honest;
that’s genuine. Ifl do something
good, ‘I have to smile. It
happens.”

Pitt comebacks.

“They were a real tough
matchup, ” Evans said. “I can’t
fault the kids’ effort.”

In addition, the Gators were
able to get to the foul line and
convert their shots, while the
Panthers suffered once again
at the charity stripe, making
18 of 31 shots. McNeal and
Morningstar made 15 of 16
free throws, but the rest of
the team was an anemic three
for IS. Both Mobley and
McCullough missed a pair of
shots in the final 2:01, and
Brown canned all four of his
final free throws to help seal
the win. I

For Brown, it was an
especially sweet win. The
sophomore from I-Iarrisburg’s
Steelton-Highspire High
School played before his
family for the first time in his
college career last night.

“It was great to come to
Pittsburgh,” he said. “Just to

come back home and play.

against a team in this state,
just to be back home is a
great feeling"

For Pitt’s Miller, it was a
better ending than the loss to
Miami in the Big East
Tournament.

“Everyone wants to go out
a winner, but at least we
played hard,” he said. “We
gave our fans a chance to see
that we wanted to play.”

Men ’s   track

By Bill Karahalios
Staff Writer

Pitt’s men’s indoor track and ﬁeld
team’s season came to an end last
weekend in the IC4As, held at Princeton
University. Over 100 schoolsfrom Maine
to North Carolina and as far west as
Notre Dame competed.

Pitt's injuries kept its competitive
level compared to other schools lower
than expected, according to head coach
John Vasvary. “Obviously [we did] not
[play] as good as some [schools] did.
We couldn’t do some things that we
would have liked to because of injuries. ”

As aresult of Jason Thompson’s
hamstringinjury, which he suffered
three weeks ago, Pitt failed to compete
in the 4x400 relay. Jason Bodner ﬁnished

second in the 3,000-meters and “ran

season; looks to improve

very, very, well,” Vasvary said.
Senior Brett Shields had a
disappointing, fifth-place finish in the
55-meter hurdles and didn't do well in
the NCAAs, not making it to the finals.
“It was a bad week for me,” Shields
said. “I had bad races — maybe because
of a lack of concentration.” -
Meanwhile Allan Johnson of North
Carolina ﬁnished first in the 55—meter
hurdles, breaking former Pitt star Roger
Kingdom’s record by a full second.
Vasvary said he doesn’t feel enough
was accomplished in the first part of
track season. “Nowhere near what we
would have liked to have done,” Vasvary
said. “We need to fill a few holes.”
But Pitt athletes are looking forward
with outdoor track, which begins March
28 at Pitt Stadium. “Definitely, we will
do better,” Shields said. ’

expect much from that boat," Kehm said.
“But somewhere during the week, they
put it all together and were very strong."
In -the novice division, the women’s
Open 4 crew of Beth Gringow, Michelle
Zielinski, Jen Sari, Jen Buck and Monica
Losken captured Pitt's only ﬂight gold of
the trip, taking a first-place ﬁnish of 6:45,
good for fourth out of 13 overall. The Pitt
boat dominated its ﬂight, beating everyone
in the race by 15 seconds. This boat also
participated in the varsity 4 and placed
above other opposing boats overall.
Both the men's and women’s crews
battled consistently over the course of the
Regatta, with no Pitt boat ﬁnishing lower
than third place.
The Panthers’ best men’s varsity finish

I came courtesy of the Open 8 ﬂight. Pitt’s

boat of (coxswain to bow) George Collins,
Matt Prechtel, Pete Alpern, Bob Falk,John
Daugherty, Todd Ridenour, ‘Bert Losken,
John Evers and Graham Turnbull placed
eighth out of 14 overall, taking second
place in its respective ﬂight (behind Yale).

Yale-also took ﬁrst place in the varsity ._
Open 4 with a time of 5:02. The.Pitt men’,s“_ '
varsity Open 4 team of Leanna Hopkins, '4
Prechtel, Alpem, Falk and Dougherty. took ‘

third in its ﬂight, at 5:22, and seventh of 19
overall. According to Hopkins, a Pitt menls
coxswain, the team was more concerned
with effort than outcome. *-

Hopkins added that most of the team's
boats had just been set during the week of
two-a—day practices in Tampa prior to the
regatta, and that such a factor affected the
outcome of the weekend.

“Our race on Saturday was our first
regatta of the year," Hopkins said. “We
had only been together in the 4 boat
twice."

As for the men’s novice division, Pitt
took third-place ﬂight ﬂnishes in all three
classes — Heavyweight 4, Light 4 and
Novice 8 —— with the Heavy 4 boat of Jeff
Kamis, Ron Schmoll, John Whiteford, Kurt
Miller and Shawn Ellis taking sixth overall
with a time of 5:53. The Panther Light ‘4
boat ran sixth of 10 overall at 6:07, while
the eight—man crew placed eighth.

to strip off their costumes, and
the men scream, whistle and yell,
“Take it all offl”

The girls then strip down to
their one—piece bathing suits.

“[The costume_sl are the only
clothes you lose during the match
because the bathing suit won’t
fall off you,” she said.

The girls have to make three
moves during the course of the

_ match in order to get paid. They

choose these moves on their own
and use one at the beginning of
eachof the three rounds.

When the first round begins,
Sharky lunges at Susie from
behind. Susie reaches over her
shoulder and grabs the back of
her opponent’s neck, ﬂipping her
over her shoulder. The men in
the crowd go wild, apparently
not having expected anything
like this. This is called the

Japanese _Flip, Susie’s favorite

move.

The pudding-covered girls stalk
around the ring and give each
other cues that are set before the
match. There is a cue for every
move they make. The girls can
tell from these cues when and

I ~ how their opponents are going to
i take them down. All they have to

do then is play__along and make it
look good. When not using take-
downs or flips, the girls‘ spin,
push, whip and throw each other
around as much as is possible on
the slick surface. By the middle
of the match, the girls can no
longer stay on their feet, partly
because of the slippery surface
and partly_because of exhaustion.

When Susie gets taken down
by Sharky, she hits the mat hard
enough to splash pudding all
over the first few rows of
spectators. She turns and winks
as she tries to get to her feet only
to slip and fall over her opponent
again. «

“We are trained, when we fall, '

to throw our hands and feet out
so the pudding splashes,” she
explained after the match ended.

Susie has pudding all over her.
It is in her ears, in her bathing suit
and caked in her hair.

“When you get all of that
pudding on you, it’s like losing
20 extra pounds,” she explained.

She heads for a baby pool set

up next to a hose and washes
most of the pudding off into the
pool before heading to the
dressing room to take a shower.

The second match is beginning
as Susie showers. The crowd is
just as vocal, but now slightly
more vulgar, yelling obscenities
throughout the course of the
match.

Coming out of the dressing
room and running her fingers
through her long hair, she said,

“Pudding really does wonders
for your hair. It ‘makes it feel so
soft and silky.”

With one match left, Susie sits
and begins to talk about why her

-parents do not know that she

pudding wrestles. ,

“My mother would be mad at
first, but when she found out that
I make $80 a show, I really think
she" would understand," she
explained. “But not my dad. He
would try to make me quit, but I

would justkeep doing it behind
his back.”

Susie said female pudding
wrestling should not be
considered degrading, and if she
had a teen-aged daughter, she
would let her wrestle.

“It would be degrading if we
wrestled with no clothes on,” she
said, “but we are fully clothed
when we wrestle, so it’s all in
good, clean fun.

“People have this preconceived

notion of what it really is. They,

think it’s really bad and disgusting.
But if you watch a show, then
you see that it really isn’t bad at
all." ~

After the last match ended and
the ring lady thanked all of the
screaming men for coming, Susie
leaned over with a sparkle in her
eye and a smile on her face and
said, “I bet none of these guys
would pay to see me dance“ or

Dodgers l9eoza’NL West race

THB PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 24, 1992

 

By Brian Gallagher
Staff Writer

With the Atlanta Braves being
the lone exception, the 1991 NL
West pennant race was a jaunt
of underachieving futility. Los
Angeles got half seasons from
Darryl Strawberry and Orel

, Hershiser and little clutch hitting
down the stretch, while the Reds
bickered like babies and packed
their season in by mid-July. As
for San Fran and the Padres, the
Giants had terrible pitching,
while San Diego couldn't
overcome its pathetic stumble
out of the starting gate in April
and May.

The 1992 NL West race will be
much different. With Cincinnati,
L.A. and San Diego making
marked improvements over the
winter with key trades among

1 . themselves, the young Braves

will find repeating as division

 champs mighty difﬁcult. Too

difficult.

Here, then, is a preview of the
teams in the NL West, and why
L.A. will reign in '92.

A The big news over the winter for
l the Los Angeles Dodgers was
the acquisition of Eric Davis from
Cincinnati. The Davis trade was
the deal of the winter. It gives
resident man-child Darryl
Strawberry two things: a fabulous
No. 3 hitter and an old friend -

allow Strawberry the opportunity

protection and a pal. This should -

to see more fastballs, relax and
have an MVP-type season. It
will also give Eric “The Former
Red” a fresh start, leaving behind
the chaos of Lou, Marge and
Schottzie (may he rest in peace)
forsunnyandlaidbacksouthern
California.

With team sparkplug Brett
Butler (.296 avg. 112 runs, 38
SB) patrolling center between
Davis and Strawberry, L.A. will
sport the league’s best outﬁeld,
and the trio’s offensive
contributions will more than
make up for any deficiencies in
the team’s mediocre infield.
Fortunately for Dodger fans, the
infield of Kal Daniels/Todd
Benzinger (1B), Juan Samuel
(2B), Jose Offerman (SS) and
Lenny Harris/Mike Sharperson
(3B) won’t be tested much,
thanks to the team’s awesome
starting pitching. _

Leading the way for L.A. will
be Ramon Martinez (17-13, 3.27),
who at the tender age of 23 has
emerged as the staff stopper
and a yearly contender for the
Cy Young. The acquisition of
Tom Candiotti (13-13, 2.65 at
Cleve/Tor.), a healthy year from
Orel Hershiser, and the
emergence of Ramon’s 20-year-
old little brother, Pedro, should

more than compensate for the '

loss of Tim Belcher (trade to
Cincy) and Mike Morgan (free
agent). The Dodgers will have a
1-2-3 starting punch of ﬁre, ﬂutter

and fortitude. It will also spell
NL West title for L.A.

Playing bridesmaid to the
Dodgers will be the revamped
Cincinnati Reds. Lou
Piniella’s boys are rebuilt and
rarin’ to bounce back from a
miserable ’91 campaign, which
saw the defending world
champions plummet to fifth
place in the division.

The Reds made three
substantial player transactions
over the winter, getting pitchers
Tim Belcher (from L.A.) and
Greg Swindell (from Cleveland)
as well as left ﬁelder Bip Roberts
(from San Diego). The moves
provide the team with fresh
arms for a crumbling pitching
staff and give Cincy a legitimate
lead-off hitter.

With Swindell and Belcher,
along withjose Rijo (15-6, 2.51,
172 K’s) and lefty Tom
Browning, Cincy matches up
evenly with the L.A. and Atlanta
starting staffs. The Reds looked
like an even better bet to

Bulls lose shortened
ﬁnal game to Detroit

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff‘ Writer

In its television ads, the Major
Indoor Lacrosse League promises
its fans 60 minutes of non-stop
goal scoring and hard-hitting
action. What the 9,500 or so odd
fans at Saturday night’s Pittsburgh
Bulls—Detroit Turbos game at the
Civic Arena saw was actually
about 54 minutes of the same.

With just under six minutes
remaining in the game, league
ofﬁcials mercifully put an end to
the lopsided contest amid a storm
of hot dog wrappers, soda and
beer cups and shaving kits that
were distributed before the game.

Oh, /yeah. The Bulls lost the
game, 13-3, dropping their ﬁnal
record to 3-5.

Thegame, however, did not
start out to be the mess it ended
up to be. The Turbos (6-2) entered
the game atop the National
Division. A win against the Bulls
or a Buffalo loss would clinch the
division for Detroit. The Bulls
needed a win coupled with a
Boston loss to clinch third place
in the National Division and the

‘final playoff spot. The Blaze_rs
‘were defeated, but from the start

of the Bulls’ game, postseason

. action was not to be.

The Bulls played exceptionally
well on defense, yielding only
one goal in the first quarter to a
Turbos offense that is as high-
powered asiits name implies.
Gary Gait scored the goal for
Detroit at 2:56, but the Bulls’
defense shut down the Turbos
for the remainder of the period.

The Turbos added to their lead
when Paul Gait beat goaltender
Bob Heyes on a penalty shot.

1 Brother Gary scored his second

goal of the game just a minute
later to increase the Turbos’
advantage to 3-0. Detroit forward
Ron Martinello scored the fourth
and final goal of the half just two
minutes before the intermission
to give the Turbos a 4-0 lead after
two.

Thanks to an early goal by
Detroit, the Bulls found
themselves staring up at a 5-0
deficit only one minute into the
second. half. Sensing the game
slipping away, the Bulls
responded in a hurry. ‘Forward
Brendan Kelly scored the Bulls’
first goal of the game. Just 20
seconds later Ron Klausner took
a pass from Dave Pietramala to
cut the Detroit lead to 5-2. With
the Turbos’ Dan Pratt off on a

holding penalty, Pietramala put
his shot past goaltender Ted
Sawicki, and the lead was down
to two. The game only got uglier
from there. '’

Detroit’s Gary Gait scored his
third goal of the game at the 8:11
mark in the third, and just 10
seconds after that he was ejected
from the game along with the
Bulls’ Ed Stephenson. From there
on it looked as if the circus had
come to town. Ejections No. 1
and 2.

With the Turbos holding a 7-3
lead, the Bulls’ Lou Delligatti,
acquired before last week’s game
against Philadelphia, was ejected
for use of illegal equipment, or
lack thereof. Apparently, Delligatti
was not wearing shoulder pads,
which is a violation of the league's
equipment policy. Ejection No.
3. '

The soap opera got even more
interesting when Detroit"
goaltender Sawicki was ejected
by the officials for using an STX
goalie stick. But Sawicki .was
readmitted to the game because

league rules on equipment use -

do not pertain to goalies.

After a 10-minute delay and
several referee and league official
conferences later, play resumed,
only to stop again when the Bulls’
Pietramala was ejected from the
game for. ﬁghting. Ejection No. 4.

To add insult to injury, Detroit
tallied one more goal from Paul
Gait to take an 8-3 lead into the
final period. .

In the fourth period, the Bulls
did not fare any better against the
defending champions," giving up
five more goals.

After the ﬁnal Detroit goal, the
aggravated and disgruntled fans,
who had decided they had seen
enough, began to shower the
ﬁeld with litter. As is league policy,
the crowd was warned that any
further debris thrown onto the
ﬁeld would result in a two-minute
delay-of—game penalty on the
home team. Taken as an
invitation, the fans ﬁlled the Arena
air with cups, prompting the
premature ending.

Bulls head coach Dennis Wey
said after the game that he tried
to file a protest during the game
but was told by the officials that
he could not do so. Wey also said
that a protest would be ﬁled with
the league ofﬁce.

“As much as I hate to say this,
the ofﬁciating was atrocious,” Wey
said. “They took the game away
from us.”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, March 24, 1992

West

Continued from page 12
runs, the Reds still sport one of
the finest hitting lineups around.
Led by all—world shortstop Barry
Larkin (.502, 20 HR, 69 RBI), right
fielder Paul O’Neill and sweet-
swinging Hal Morris (NL 2nd-
best .318 avg.), Cincy should
ﬂourish at the plate. The insertion
of Roberts into the lineup, along
with minor leaguer Reggie
Sanders or Dave Martinez (from
Montreal) in centerfield, should
give the Reds more than enough
speed to offset the loss of Davis.
And while it won’t be enough to
outlast L.A., Cincy should make
plenty of noise in ’92.

While Cincy’s starting pitching
and league—leading hitting will
keep them aﬂoat in the pennant
chase, look for failures to sustain
pitching and clutch hitting to be
the downfalls for the defending
NL champion Atlanta Braves.
Why? It's just simply too much to
ask of such a young team — to
repeat the intensity, to repeat the
high—level effort.

Two reasons why the Braves
won’t repeat: 1.) The Reds and
Dodgers have made marked
improvements in pitching and
are better teams in '92 than in ’91;
and 2.) Atlanta cannot possibly
sneak up on the division and

» play above their heads like they

did a year ago. As defending
champs, they have a target on
their heads. Everyone will be
gunning for it, and both the
Dodgers and Reds will hit it.
This season Manager Bobby
Cox returns the same cast of
characters, with catcher Damon
Berryhill being the only
noteworthy addition. They boast
a great defensive infield
(Pendleton, Belliard, Lernke and

Bream), the best young pitching
in the game and future MVPs in
Ron Gant and Dave Justice. But
despite all this talent, 1992 will
not be the year of the Braves.
Glavine, Avery and most of all
Pendleton cannot possibly repeat
their ’91 performances. Ijustdon’t
see how lightening can strike
twice in Georgia. Sorry Ted and
Jane, the young Braves will fall
by the wayside by mid-August,
left only to dream of what could
have been had Lonnie Smith
remembered how to run the bases
in the ’91 series finale.
One team looking to remember
last year is the San Diego
Padres, who came on strong in
the second half to finish third
with alrespectable 84-78 record.
Manager Greg Riddoch’s lineup
card sports some of the league's
brightest stars in four-time batting
champ Tony Gwynn, slugger Fred
McGriff, shortstop Tony
Fernandez and Gold Glove
catcher Benito Santiago. But
despite these marquee names,
the Padres have some major

question marks heading into the ‘

season. Gwynn aside, San Diego
may have_ the worst group of
outfielders in baseball. Both left
and center field are up for grabs
this spring, with part-timersJerald
Clark. . and Thomas Howard
expected to fight for centerfield
and Darrin Jackson (21 HR)
projected to replace the departed
Bip Roberts in left.

The Padres’ biggest off-season
move was trading Bip Roberts for

Cincy stopper Randy Myers. The ‘

presence of the fiery lefty will
give San Diego a proven finisher.
As for the starters, Riddoch has
the potential for a pretty
competitive staff with Bruce Hurst

(15-8, 3.29 ERA), Andy Benes
(15-11, 3.03), Ed Whitson and
Greg Harris. Hurst and Benes are
the horses of this staff and must
have career years if San Diego is
to contend.

Filling the two outfield spots
adequately could be the
difference between third and ﬁfth
place for the Padres. And if they
can get career year from Benes,
Myers, Jackson and possibly trade
for a second— or third—bagger,
they could contend. But that's a
lot of ifs.

Fourth place seems more likely
for San Diego, which won’t ﬂy
until next year, when a certain
Mr. Bonds will patrolJack Murphy
Stadium for a cool $8 million per
annum.

It seems like yesterday that the
San Francisco Giants were
battling both earthquakes and
the Oakland A's in the World
Series, but it’s going on three
years. In that time Manager Roger
Craig has seen his pitching staff
crumble like the Berlin Wall, a
ridiculous spending spree on free-
agent busts like Bud Black and
Dave Righetti and the departure
of Kevin Mitchell for some
unproven pitching.

Where does that leave the

Giants going into this season?.

From great to godawful — with a
hard-hitting, slick—fielding infield
of Will Clark, Robby Thompson,
Jose Uribe and Matt Williams, a
suspect outfield minus Mitchell
and a pitching staff that had a
league—worst 4.03 ERA in '91.
Runs will be no problem for
the Giants. Clark (.501, 29 HR,
116 RBI) will continue to feast on

NL pitching, alongside fellow .

power broker Matt Williams. But
if the Giants are to make any

noise in the West, outfielders
Kevin Bass _ and Willie McGee
must have monster years at the
plate to offset the void created by
Mitchell's absence and the team’s
anemic pitching.

The Achilles’ tendon of the

Giants the past few seasons has
been pitching, or the lack thereof.
Lefty Bud Black can only get
better after last season's ﬂop (12-
16, 3.99), whileJohn Bu rkett gives
‘Frisco 200+ innings a year. Injured
lefty Trevor Wilson can’t be
counted on as a reliable starter.
And while the Mitchell trade
brought three pitchers, only Bill
Swift and Mike Jackson figure to
make the opening—day roster.
Swift (1.99 ERA, 17 saves) ﬂgures
to make the earliest impact as a
starter.

The names don’t sound so bad
on paper, but in a division full of
Martinezes, Rijos and Glavines,
they amount to little more than
unreliable, mediocre pitching. No
reliable pitching spells pretender
— not contender. Put down the
Bay Boys for ﬁfth.

That -leaves the Houston

Astros, the official road team of
the Republican Party.

Picking sixth place in the NL .‘ I

West is the most predictable

parlay this side of Cleveland in ' 
the AL Least. A layup, baby! Open- '

netter! .
The Astros are young and bad
and have no right to think about
anything but last place in the‘
West. Sure, they have some
promising ballplayers (’91 Rookie
of the Year Jeff Bagwell (.294, 82
RBI), catcher-turned-second
baseman Craig Biggio, Steve

. Finley and pitcher Pete Harnisch

(12—9, 2.70), to name them all),

but they also have a pitching staff '

(coached by the. immortal Bob

Cluck) that consists of Mark “

Portugal, Al Osuna, Xavier
Hernandez and Darryl Kile.

In a division where the top _
teams have five or six all-star ,
candidates, a mere four or five "
promising players just isn’t going M

to cut it.

It's a laughable and pathetic ; ~ 

notion, and so are the '92 ‘Astros.
The less said about Houston, the
better. -

Greeks

Continued from page 3
Each

participant had to prepare a two-
to four-minute talent. Five points
were deducted from those events
that ran over the time limit. Most
of the participants sang songs as
their talent. Christopher Mooney
of Phi Sigma Kappa performed
an original song for the crowd.
Matthew Graves of Phi Delta
Theta recited the Jabberwocky
as his talent. Graves was originally
going to sing a song, but his

pianist was unable to come to the.

competition.

“Up until two nights ago I had
nothing to do, but I wanted to
stay in the competition because
it’s a lot of fun. I chose the
Jabberwocky because I’ve loved
itsince I was a little kid. Itwas the
only thing that kept the monsters
out at night,” Graves said.

The participants said they were
all thankful for the support they
have received in preparing for
the competition.

Theta Phi Alpha member
Danielle Walton said, “[Theta Phi
Alpha members] have been really
supportive. When there are so
many people behind you, it
makes it seem that there's not so
much focus on the individual.”

Kappa Delta member Laini
Samuels said the other
participants are giving each other
support. “Seeing everyone in
practices, we got to know each
other. The Greeks are coming
together,” Samuels said.

Delta Delta Delta member
Cindy Freyvogel, who won the
event two years ago, said winning
the competition happens quickly.
“You practice so long. It's nerve-

wrecking representing your
whole sorority by yourself, but it
pays off when you win."

For the first _ time, the
competition was electronically
scored. “The idea was to make
{Greek God and Goddess] more
of a pageant and cut the time
down,” Trojanowski said.

The program also included an
introduction of the candidate, a
30-second joke accompanied with
a slide show of the participant's
baby pictures. These events were
not judged.

The other women that placed
in the Greek Goddess competition
were Christine Bienkowski of
Delta Delta Delta, Marti Trettel of
Chi Omega, Kirsta Bleyle of Kappa
Alpha Theta and the runner-up,
Shannon Kennedy of Sigma Sigma
Sigma.

The other men to place in the
Greek God competition were
Tom White of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Marc Muroff of Zeta Beta
Tau, Eric Farst of Sigma Chi and
ninner-up Rob Racunas of Pi
Kappa Alpha.

The winners of the five
kilometer walk/nin and the all

Greek kick-off were announced -

last night.

For sororities in the five-
kilometer race, Kappa Alpha
Theta placed fifth, Alpha Epsilon
Phi placed fourth, Delta Phi
Epsilon placed third, Chi Omega
placed second and Delta Zeta
placed first. For the fraternities in
the five kilometer race, Phi Delta
Theta placed fifth, Pi Lambda Phi
placed fourth,‘Pi Kappa Alpha
placed third, Phi Gamma Delta
placed second and Sigma Chi
won.
