}’itt Hosts
Debaters
In Tourney

The third annual pre-season
:ross-examination debate tour-
iament gets underway in the
Stephen Foster Memorial tomor-
jow at 9:30 a.m.

Over 150 individual debaters,
epresenting 14 tri-state universi-
ies and colleges, will participate.

Resolved: That the Non-Com-
nunist Nations Should Form a New
nternational Organization” is the
iuestion to be debated.

In order to provide some variety
n the intercollegiate debating sea-
;on Men's Debate is introducing
rot only a cross-examination style
omorrow, but also a slightly dif-
erent method of evaluation.

New Scoring Meuiod

Instead of the customary scoring
)ased on superior and excellent
ndividuaj, debaters, team supe-
‘iority will be recognized.

Each school will be represented
>y three four-man teams, including
1 varsity, junior varsity, and no-
rice team.

Also, each student debater will
rate each of his opponents sepa-
rately for each round with both
numerical and descriptive rating.

For the first time in the history
of the tourney, there will be no
zhairman, timekeeper or expert
judge for the debates. Debaters
will introduce themselves, time
bne another, address their re-
marks to the .opposing team, and
rate each other’s competence as
‘debaters.

Advisors To Judge

Each team will be criticized in
the third round of debate by a com-
petent faculty advisor from another
college.

Schools competing are Dennison
gllniversity, Penn State, College of
‘Steubenville, West Virginia, Mt.
Mercy, Carnegie Tech, Duquesne,
Washington and Jefferson, Califor-
nia State Teachers College, Seton
Hill, St. Vincent, Geneva, and Ohio
State University, and Pitt.

minute details for the third annual tri-state debate tourney. Debaters
from 14 colleges and universities will be here tomorrow. Seated left to
right are Lud Lippert, secretary, Ed Burtell, assistant manager, and

MC Lounge Project

BY TIM KOVAR

Men's Council’s plan to turn 817 C1. into a men’s lounge is
running into one major snag according to Don Milletary, head of
the committee working on the project.

The many little problems that first confronted the project‘
have developed into the one large question of what to do with the

net profit of $230.26

Civil,Defense 

Board Picked

Viers W. Adams, director of Ells-
gworth Center, head of the University
civilﬁclefense program, has announced
the appointment of an eleven-man
advisory committee to administer
the program.

The committee includes Dr. John
V. Geise, professor of history;
Raymond L. Coss, superintendent
Vof'buildings and grounds; Dr. Paul
McLain, professor of physiology; Dr.
James A. Crabtree, professor of
public health.

Dr. Ruth P. Kuehn, dean of the
school of Nursing; Dr. Stanton C.
Crawford, dean of the College; Dr.
Herbert E. Longenecker, dean of
the Graduate School; Frank W.
Shockley, director of the Extension
Division.

Dr. Lawrence E. Van Kirk, dean
of the school, of Denistry; COL H01-

land L. Robb, professor of military
science; and Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men.

The committee has already met

ionicei to outline future plans.

All other activities in th€ Festi-

Ball showed the highest loss of

second in the loss department,

losing $168.66.

In his report Earl Jacob, SC ap-
pointments committee chairman,
recommended that the Tea Dance
be taken from the activities of the
Spring Fesitval week. "This has
been a financial failure for the past
three years. Each year it is attended
by less people, 190 to be exact f0l’
last year,” he said.

Jacob also suggested that Tap
Day be dropped from Spring Festival
Committee jurisdiction and be
placed in the hands of a separate
committee.

val positions be picked up from

men’s office.

find such a place.

Squatters Troublous

MC would have the band move so
that it can complete plans for the
lounge.

The dean of men’s office also
wants to find a place for the band,
that office having stated that it is
in favor of using 816 for a lounge.

So far Theodore H. Biddle, dean
of men, is the only person to ad-
vance a workable idea to clear up
the situation.

He is currently-working on a plan
to utilize the rooms adjoining 817
‘for the storage of band equipment,
so that there will be no unnecessary
moving of valuable instruments that
might ‘be damaged by excessive
handling.

Arthur Doubtful

Mr. Arthur agrees with this plan
but is doubtful if the side rooms
will provide sufficient space.

‘No Quota System

Medicine .

Med and Pre-Dent Forum yesterday.
Speaking before an audience of:
80 students, Dr. Horn declared that

plication forms referring to race and
religion are not used to discriminate
against students of any minority
group.

ole purpose of the questions,
which Dr. Horn admitted were “po-
tentially discriminatory,” is to
give admissions officials the full-
est possible understanding of the

“Certainly,” said Dr. Horn, “no-
body feels that a Jew, or a Negro.
or a Scotchman would make a better
or worse doctor than anyone else
on the basis of his nationality or
race alone.”

Nevertheless, the assistant dean
qualified, a doctor's future decis-
ions, outlook, and social relations
are greatly influenced by his indi-
vidual background.

Draft Hits

' Few Here

In spite of the serious state of
international affairs the University's

enrollment has not yet been drasti-'

cally effected by students entering
military service.

Although a large percentage of
Pitt's male students are subject to
the draft or call from reserve armed
service units, only 134 have left
school since the beginning of the
semester.

Alena Hornet, assistant University
editor, reported that 23 graduate,
three professional, and 108 under-
graduate and non—degree students
have left Pitt for the armed services
to date.

Draft Postponed

Under the present set-up draft
postponements are available for
qualified students. Upon call to

active duty, either through the draft
or reserve units, students may obtain
letters from their respective school
heads requesting postponement.

These students must be in the
upper half of their class and have
completed at least one full academic
year.

In Medical School,’ 

Horn Declares

BY JACK MARKOWITZ
“There is no quota system” based upon race, religion or

national background in operation in the University School of

That statement was made by Dr. Richard Henry Horn, as-
sistant dean of the medical school, in a discussion at the Pre-

questions on the med school’s ap—'

And ‘since the community served
by the medical school is a com-
pound of varied backgrounds and
outlooks, the speaker reasoned,
"a certain justification” exists for
supplying men who are going to be
"useful” to the community.

To clarify this position, Dr. Horn
added the speculation that a med
school graduating class could con-
ceivably consist of 100 women and
no men, if the applicants particular
"backgrounds” were not taken into
consideration.

Services a Factor

Parallel with the example of
"men” and "women,” Dr. Horn con-
cluded that an over-supply of “cer-
tain racial and religious groups,”
would not be fitted to serve the
community as well as a more mixed
group.

Without asking such “potentially
discriminatory” questions, the en-
rollment "can be carried to ex-
tremes,” the Doctor explained.

But these questions are not used
for discriminatory purposes, the
speaker reiterated.

"I would be perfectly willing to
pick a class without reference on
the application to background,” said
Dr. Horn.

Even if no reference to "back-
ground” were made on the applica-
tion form, admissions officials in
interviews would be "apt to choose
people because of what they have
been” as evidenced in the appli-
cations’ attitudes.

Not a Good Solution

Asked if the medical school could
not consider the student's back-
ground after his admission to the
school, Dr. Horn replied that it
would be much “like opening the:
package: after Christmas.”

The assistant dean emphasized
the point that, in spite of the bad
connotation of the word, applicants
to med school are judged by what is
by nature a “discriminatory pro-
cess.”

The school selects those whom it
considers to be the best qualified

of the applicants, and that is dis?‘

crimination, said Dr. Horn.

Dr. Horn reported that the School
of Medicine has “given thought” to
the removal of questions of race
and religion on its application forms.

Spring Pre-Registration Kits

To Be Mailed by

Dec. 15

Preparations are already underway for Pre-Registration for
spring classes, according to E.A. Batchelder, assistant registrar.

Pre-registration will run from

Jan. 8 to Jan. 13.

Final registration will take place in the Cathedral of Learn-

ing on Feb. 7,8,9.

Sixteen thousand pre-registration
kits containing spring semester
time schedules of classes and a
study list, will be sent out before
Dec. 15 to every student register-
ed in the fall semester.

Same Classes

Mr. Batchelder stressed that stu-
dents are required to schedule them-
selves in the same sections to
which they are now reporting except
where fall semester courses do not
continue in the spring semester.

On Monday and Tuesday, Jan. 8
and 9, students should take their
registration kits with them- to their
classes.

On those days they will receive

'-from the instructors the Spring sem-

ester class cards for continuation
courses. .

If any of the desired classes do
not meet on Monday or Tuesday,
class cards will be distributed dur-
ing meetingsllater in the week.

Envelopes Picked Up

During the week of Jan. 8 stu-
dents are to pick up a pre—registra-
tion envelope containing their regis-
tration forms at the Registrar's
station in the Commons Room.

On Thursday and Friday, Jan. 11
and 12, class card service will be
available in departmental offices
for students who must register for
courses that are not continued from
the fall semester, and for those re-
quiring schedule adjustments.

Share The NEWS

We're sorry if you were one of the students who couldn’t find
a Pitt News Wednesday, or if you’ve had trouble locating. a copy
at other times this year. It's not many newspapers that have a

4 larger demand than they have a supply. "i ii

But the unfortunate fact is thatwe can’t afford to print enough
copies of the News to furnish all the people who pay for them
with their own copy. Our appropriation, which comes out of your
tuition, was cut by $2000 of our operating budget last year, so
that it has been impossible for us to print an edition of sufficient

' . size to meet the demand.

The staff of the News no longer receive even expenses, so
that they must in effect pay for the privilege of working for the
News. The Faculty Club and the University’s administrative"
offices no longer receive copies, so that a few extra papers are
available to students. And, as you know, we have cut the number

I of editions, so that in January and February you will be receiv-
ing only one edition of the News each week. .

All these ‘measures, and they have been drastic, have been
forced on us by this budget cut, which can be compensated for
only partically by extra advertising.

So won't you cooperate with us and take only as many copies
as you need for your own group?

Inasmuch... \

The finest expression of Christmas giving you can make this
year costs you nothing but half an hour of your time. You don’t
have to cross a picket line to get it, and the package is supplied
free of charge. You won’t have to"‘c'harge it now and worry about
it next month. And it is 'more in keeping with the original idea
of Christmas than anything you can find in a department store.

You won't know who your gift goes to. The person who re-
ceives it may have skin of a different pigmentation than yours.
He may even observe Christmas in a manner entirely foreign to
you. But the three kings who instituted the custom of giving

‘gifts at Christmastime were, if legend is correct, a white
man, an Oriental, and a Negro. And just as surely as if you laid
it personally at His feet, your gift will go to the same Child
to whom they gave gold, frankincense and myrrh. K

The gift? A pint of your blood, a part of you that you can
spare, but that a victim of the last war sorely needs.

You can give this gift next Thursday at the Red Cross Blood
Donor Center at 303 Smithfield Street. The Pitt News will take
your name today in its office 825 C1. After today, you can make
an appointment by calling GRanf 1-4923. You can go to the Donor
Center any time from noon to 8:30 p.m. next Thursday, Dec. 14,
and give your gift quickly, painlessly, and with the knowledge
that: ii

brethren, you have done it unto me.”

 

 

Sage Advice?

By ED JENSEN

triolic, by the Sun-Telegraph in
week.

the New Deal, Socialism, Britain
France and ghe rest of our allies.It
also suggested, or rather howled,
that we should vacate our UN seat
to the Chinese Communists whom
they bitterly denounce as our
enemies. This is rather complicated
mental gymnastics.

Peculiar Odor

The whole editorial reeks of isola-
tionism, defeatism, reaction, and
downright senility, not to mention
cowardess. If we follow the course
advised and huddle behind an im-
penatrateable barrier, the rest of
the world will either rapidly turn
Communistic or be turned Commun-
istic. This country remains as the
sole power in the free world with
the economic and military resources
to effectively resist Communist
aggression. We should serve as a
rallying point for the rest of the
democracies.

It will do us no good to run-out

Get out of Korea. Get out of the United Nations.
This sage advise was offered, amid a flood of assorted vit-

a front page editorial earlier this

The same editorial managed to get off resounding attacks on

on the United Nations. Besides ir-
reparably ruining our prestige in
the eyes of the world, it would put
us at a practical disadvantage to the
Communists. The UN, among other
things, is probably the best sound-
ing board that now exists. It gives
us a place where we can propagan-
dize our brand of democracy to the
rest of the world. We should not
leave; the UN to the Russians.

Theeditorial urges that we pull
out of Korea. As things stand it
seems more than likely that we will
be booted out of Korea. Faulty in-
telligence, combined with a wishy-
washy attitude by the government
have made such a demand a little
meaningless.

But the general tone of the edit-
orial itself. It sounds a great deal
like the sort of narcisstic isolation-
ism that prevented us from joining

‘ ory has demonstrated the fallacy of

the League of Nations after the
last war. The same arguments. are
used despite the fact the history
has demonstrated the fallacy of an
isolationstic policy.

We're Not Alone ,

We can no longer walk around as
though the rest of the world did not
exist. It does, and it is watching us.
If we pull out of Korea and the UN
we are liable to one day find a lot
of belligerent Russians trying to
migrate to the U.S. They won’t be
interested in farming either.

But the general tone of the editor-
ial, and the type of thinking it re-
presents, is 'far more serious than
the editorial itself.It sounds agreat
deal like the sort of narcistic iso-
lationism that prevented us from
joining the League of Nations after

But the editorial does make one;
wonder. Is Mr. Hearst dropping his
man MacArthur because he is suffer-
ing a defeat? Probably not. He'll
blame it on the New Deal.

They Deserve Refund

Of course, they deserve the re-
fund.

What about the poor volunteer,
though?

In this age of cynicism you leave
yourself open for a salvo of sneers
if you mention a passe word like
patriotism. So I won’t.

Why, though, can’t the volunteer
go off to war with a few miserable
University dollars jingling in his
khakis?

True, so far there have not been
too many empty seats in the class-

Why doesn’t a student who volunteers for service in the armed
forces get a refund on his unu’sed tuition when he leaves school '

Consider in the same light the fact that draftees and recalled
veterans do get back a portion of their money.

ing. Still, I can't see why they
shouldn’t get their money back.

Band vs. MC

Consider
mental battle in the University -
the Band vs. Men’s Council.

With the MC troops dedicated to
oust the Band platoons from the
Panther Room, 817 Cl., and re-
place them with a lounge, any-
thing can happen.

I for'see a bloody tong war, a
crusade of brother against brother,
a veritable fratricidal melee of
baton against gavel anditorrential
eloquence trying to stamp out a
brash brass drum duet.

A reign of terror will start. The
Panther Office will be pressed in-
to service as a hospital and the
dead will be carted off to a great
necropolis, cool, and green, and
beautiful, on the lawn before Heinz
Chapel. '

So right now I want to enter a
plea for negotiation.

Also consider the case of
journalism Teacher Mrs. Marjorie
Bernhard. After careful thought
she has determined that old jokes

Gettysburg

Next for
Hoopsters

B)’ WILL DOERGE

Pitt basketball followers who

are looking forward to a better
hoop season this year better not
raise their hopes too high.
C It’s true that Dr. H. C. Carlson,
beginning his 29th year as head
coach, has a fairly good sophomore
crop to back up Seniors George
Hromanik, Mike Belich, and Bob
Yurko.

But, the Panthers are confronted
with a backbreaking schedule in
which they must play their first 11
games away from home against

some of the top teams in the coun— ; i

try.

Green Club

Pitt has already bowed to Kent
State and the Akron Goodyears on
the road. They play at Gettysburg
tomorrow. In all, they play 21 of 27
games away from the Stadium.

"Ours is a green club,” states
Carlson, "and we’ve been making
too many mistakes, almost twice as
many as the officials. If we’d have
played our first two games at home,
though, we’d have won them both.

“Belich, Yurko, and llromanik
-are doing well, and Sophomore
Mickey Zernich has the poise of a
veteran. But after them, we have a
jittery, inexperienced team.”

Figure Eight Scrapped

Carlson had been using Soph
Frank Christopher as starting
center, but Christopher will be re-
placed by Don Virostek, another
sophomore, in tomorrow’s game.
At 6-4, they are the two tallest
players on the team.

DISCARDS fiom

 

By WILL DOERGE
Dr. H.C. Carlson isn’t at all pleased with the Pitt hoop schedule
which calls for only six home games out of 27 carded.
"I don't like the idea of playing only a few home games any better

than anyone else,” says the Pitt
coach, "But what can we do?
There's no place to play the
home games.

“we're under a handicap before
we even begin the season. Home
teams have too much of an advan-
tage in this sport.”

Why, then, does Pitt persist
in following such a schedule‘?

“To be concrete,” states Carl-

son, “we are guaranteed 31200
when we play away against such
teams as Bradley or North Caro-
lina State.

"On the other hand, we can't
afford to bring in teams and
guarantee them as much when we
can’t make anything on the games
at the Stadium.”

‘‘I wouldn't say that is is an in-
dictment of university officials
or even myself, as much as it is
an indictment of western Penn-
sylvania as a whole that there
isn’t a decent municipal place to
play big-time basketball here.”

Carlson is hoping that the Pitt
field house which should be ready
in the near future will be the
answer to this problem.

* * *

This past season, many football

coaches have beefed that merely
winning football games isn’t
enough any more. Not only must
they win, but they must beat the
points on the football pools.

Pitt’s Len Casanova may have
had his troubles this fall, but this
wasn’t‘ one of them. The Panthers
seldom hadto worry about beating
the spot. _

In the two games they were
favored, the Panthers beat West
Virginia by 14 points after being
favored by 13, and lost to Penn
State by one when they were favor-
ed by six.

***

Sophomore Art Boyd, who is a
promising prospect on Doc Carl-
son's hoop team, is just getting
over the effects of a virus infec-
tion and has been working out
with the team.

Bespectacled Boyd is a serious
student of the game, and when
Carlson asked him how he was
coming along he replied, in all
seriousness:

‘‘I know I slow up the first
and second teams when I run with
them, but you know, Doc, I think
the third team Slows me up,"

Hamilton Denies Tiff With Irsh I
Claims Report of TV  
Squabble ‘Not Factual’

A recent article by The Sporting News stated that "Captain

Tom Hamilton, athletic director

made a formal complaint to Notre Dame officials that television
was wrecking the football program at Pitt. "’

Hamilton, however, denied that report this week. .

“The Sporting News item is simply not factual,” declared

Hamilton. “A year and a half ago I
wrote a friendly letter to Notre
Dame officials suggesting they
consider the effects that their
televised games would have on
their friends in the intercollegiate
field.

Irish Study Matter

“As I understand it, the Notre
Dame people have since been stu-
dying the matter in compliance
with my request. But I repeat, that
was more than a year ago. It was
not a ‘formal complaint’ as re-
ported.” _

The problem of television is
expected to be the hottest issue of
debate at the NCAA meeting in
Dallas next month. Hamilton is
the head of the television com-
mittee which is to make a report
at. this meeting.

Hamilton says he has been try-
ing to maintain a position of
neutrality in making his investiga-
tions on the TV question. “But I
am afraid that the erroneous publi-
city on the TV issue may infer that
I am lobbying in behalf of Pitt.”

Favors Sanity Code

‘In addition to the television
problem, the NCAA Sanity Code
will be under fire at the Dallas
meeting. Hamilton hesitates to
classify himself as Code support-
er, or Code abolisher, or Code
modifier.

But he does say that "for the
most part, Pitt is in favor of the
Sanity Code. We consider it a
trend toward proper governing of
collegiate football. It is, of course,
not perfect, but it is basically the
right ideas.”

Hamilton does expect changes
to be made in the code, although
he did not speculate as to what
these changes might be. “I’ll say
this much - there is going to be
a real battle down there in Dal-
las.”

lets [lave Wrestling 8
In Commons Boom “*;';§:';",:3,§:§:-*‘*"

 

If we are to maintain a proper sense of perspective, we must‘
not let the annual battle for a Commons Room Christmas dance

outgrow its due importance. The

 

‘pro-dance bloc is becoming ex- '
tremely vociferous, yet we must
remem bet that the Korean war is

still going on, and that there are
pressing affairs of state coming
before Congress every day.

At the same time, we must not
sell the Commons Room squabble
short. Granted the matter of a
dance is a petty one, it neverthe-
less raises other questions of im-

. mensely broader import.

For example: Why not stage

wrestling in the Commons Room?

Worthy Issue
Now here is an issue which I
mean to fight out, through hell and
- high water. Is’ there a better locale
“for intercollegiate wrestling matches
than the Commons Room,tha't grand,
’ stately interior which resembles the
inside of a cathedral (and indeed,
is-exactly that)?

Last year, Coach Rex Peery’s
stalwarts grappled at the Stadium
Pavilion, high atop the DeSoto
Street mountain where only Alpine

  

 

yodelers and wrassling bugs of
the most fanatic order dared to
venture. The fascinating sport of

P legitimate wrestling is still new
to Pitt, and we cannot sell it to
the dubious unless we bring it
down to sea level.

-Being public-spirited, this de-
partment undertook to remedy the
situation last year by launching a
campaign to stage matches in
Stephen Foster Memorial.

 

Proposal Reasonable

The proposition seemed reason-
able. Old Foss himself had been a
sports fan. It wasn't Irving Berlin
who wrote The Camptown Races,
you know.

Notwithstanding, the crusade was
resisted staunchly by Mr- Fletcher
Hodges, director of Foster Hall. In
a personal interview which started
with me talking and ended with the
interviewee talking, the Director
lectured me on the traditions of the
Hall, reminded me of the constant

 

debate is getting. torrid and the

demand for its use, presented me
with a book of Stephen Foster
melodies, and said good-day.

My campaign ended then and
there, but I am now privileged to
know that Foster composed My
Brudder Gum, Nelly Was a Lady, and
Open Thy Lattice, Dear.

Commons Perfect

But to get on with the Commons
Room, here is fresh ground ready
for conquest. Many’s the time a
large platform has been placed in
the center of the place so that the
Glee Club might serenade us in
full view. Well, the_ wrestling team
is every bit as much a student
activity as the Glee Club.

With the platform providing a

slight elevation to the action, floor-

level. spectators should have an
adequate view. Excellent aerial
vision could be had, in the mean-
time, from the numerous balconies
on the second and third floors.
Proponents of the Christmas
dance have been dreaming wistfully
of a Commons Room resplendent with
holly and firs and mistletoe . . .
and of crackling log fires alive with
the yuletide spirit . . . and of pipe
organ strains of Silent Night echoing
through the big chamber at midnight.
I know it will be hard for those

persons to sympathize with the
aesthetic pleasures of wrestling
fans, but our breed thrills to the

thought of a Commons Room tensely
keyed to the ‘slapping of flesh
against flesh . . .to the smell of
fresh sweat . . . to the cries of
"Throw the bum, Jumbo! Throw the
bum!”

Psi Omega, Delts Clash for IM Title ,

intramural competition this year,
have fought through three elimina-
tion and semifinal games in addition
to the regular season’s contests.

Both teams are undefeated, the
Delts having taken the measureof
the seven other squads in their
Fraternity League section while
The Psi O’s were winning the Pro-
fessional League title.

Tomorrow’s winner gains the
title of All-Campus Champions,
and thus gets a chance to meet the
best IM team from-Carnegie Tech
next week. The winner of the inter-
school contestgains the All-Oakland
title.

Psi Omega is the defending
champion, having copped both the
IM and All-Oakland titles last year.

Campney In
Athletic Frat

Harry Campney, varsity tennis
player, has displayed unusual ver-
satility in athletics while obtaining
high scholarship to become the first
Pitt student to qualify for Sigma
Delta Psi, national honorary athletic
fraternity.

The athletic fraternity includes
two members of the Pitt faculty,
Dr. Karl Oermann, professor of. phy-
sical education, and Lloyd Duff,
assistant track coach.

Campney is a sophomore majoring
in physical educa tion.

Some 40 men are now trying for
entrance to this select group. Closest
is George Alcott who has but one
more event, the 20-foot rope climb,
to complete.

Leo Bemis, head of intramural
sports, is the local patron for the
fraternity. He has been testing men
for almost a year at Trees gym and
the Stadium.

Most notable in Campney’s over-
all record is his 2.87 quality point
average. His times and distances

fl Fresh Matmen
Well Titled

;{ . If the present freshman wrestling
S crop lives up to its high school
records and" titles, Coach Rex
Peery will have a fine frosh squad
this season, plus a reservoir of
talented grapplers to choose from
4 in 1952.

This year’s youngsters come to
Pitt trimmed with state champion-
ship ribbons and press clippings
galore. They figure to add the
needed depth to most of the weight
divisions.

Peery’s men, with two excep-
tions, hail from Pennsylvania
schools. The two “foreigners,”
.who come from Oklahoma, are Hugh
Peery and Gail Ellis.

Coach’sSon

Peery, son of the wrestling
coach, hails from Tulsa Central
where he was twice state cham-
pion in the 123-pound division.
Ellis, a heavy, was runnerup for
state honors. The latter also serv-
ed as linernan on the frosh foot-
team. ,

. The Pennsylvanians are headed

lby Waynesburg’s Tommy Alberts,
177-pounder, and Don Haney,
157-pounder from Canonsburg.
Both boys were state champs for
two years. *-

. More Titles Yet

Other good prospects who will
-merit a second look from Peery in-
clude: Charles Uram, 157-pounder
from Carnegie and George Mat-
thews, 137-pounder from Munhall.
Both were runnerups for WPIAL
honors in their respective divi-
sions.

Three other grapplers rounding
out the group are: Ted Stinner,
147-pounder from Dormont, Harold
Dunham, Canonsburg’s 130-pound
scrapper, and Bob Welte, 137,

.- schooled at Wilkins burg.

Radosevtch Back

Gridder George Radosevich, a
regular last season, turned out for
practice this week, and will be
out to win back his center posi-
tion. ‘.

A promising sophomore, Art
Boyd, who was expected f'o see
first string service this season; is
still recovering from the after ef-
fects of a virus infection. Boyd
works out with the varsity, how-
ever, to round into shape, and Carl-
son is hoping he’ll be ready soon.

Following the Gettysburg game,
Carlson and his caravan take off
on an eight-game western tour
next week before they return home
to play Westminster in the home
opener on Thursday, Jan. 4.

With the schedule Pitt has, no
matter how much the team is im-
proved over last year’s team which
had a 4-14 record, it still looks
like the boys are in for a bad cam-
paign as far as their won and lost
record is concerned.

Teaching Methods Tops,
Says Latin Student

N BOAL
nts really lives up to the label

Graduate student Mario Teza was born in Guatemala City,
but his family background is more complicated than just Guate-

malan.

His father was Italian, having
come to Central America from
his _native Venice. Although a
Venetian, he traced his original
ancestry back to Spain. Teza’s
mother belonged to Monterrey,
Mexico family.

The 24 year old Latin-American
arrived in the   
United States in .'

   
   

to further 
education, begun 1‘
at the Guatemal
City Colegio. 4

Teza transfer-
red to Pitt in
1949, ‘after stu-
dying at St. Vin
cent College in
Latrobe. .  . . . 

Teza now has Teza
his bachelor’s degree in letters,

 

and is trying his hand at teaching.
At Geneva College, in Beaver
Falls, Pa. he's handling Spanish
classes two days a week.

Excellent Teaching Methods?

As a student, Teza is particular-
ly impressed by "the capablerfa:
culty and Pitt's excellent methods
of teaching.”

His greatest desire, however, is
to see a better understanding
brought about between the Ameri-
cans.

"I wish more North Americans
could know their southern neigh-
bors as I have come to know and
respect the United States,” says
Teza.

"People get along much better,”
he added, “once they understand
each other’s ‘customs and pro-
blems.”
