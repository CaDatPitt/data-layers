_ MCHANCELLOR LITCHFIELD outlined the re-
‘ sponsibilities of an‘ urban university

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ
Chancellor Litchﬁeldv outlined

A the responsibilities of an urban

University in a talk addressed to
the Druids, men’s honorary fra-
ternity. He gave his talk Tuesday
evening in Dining Room B of the
Student Union.

Litchfield answered the criti-
cism leveled at big universities to-.

‘ day by educators. Many feel that
U universities are merely becoming
research farms, and the phrase

‘,‘p_ublish or perish” has become
its motto. These educators claim

_ the primary responsibility of a

university is to educate the young.

The chancellor stated th at
teaching the young, although -a
primary responsibility of a’uni-

. versity, is not its sole responsi-
‘ bility. In addition to educating, a

university must carry on those

ter minds in a given ﬁeld. ,
Aids Economic Redevelopment
Because of the moderation of
these two roles, Litchﬁeld said,
this University will be able to
signiﬁcantly contribute to this
area’s' economic redevelopment.
The chancellor explained that
the Panther Hollow research
project will attract many top
minds, as well as several large
corporations. The actual- econo-
mic value o':',the project, how-
ever, is unassessable at the
present according to Litchﬁeld.

“It is impossible to say now
what the economic consequences
of the I Panther Hollow Project
will be,” Litchﬁéld said,‘ “It will
be easier to assess ten or 15 years
from now. A  -

‘Informal Courses

Slated for Winter

The political _aftermath of a
presidential assassination is one
of the subjects to be examined in
a University ‘informal course,
“Presidential Preview.”

The evening course is one of
25 such courses in the Univer-
sity’s planned winter series which
will begin Jan. 20. Courses have
no requirements for entrance and
offer no academic credit.

Guest lecturers will analyze the
party’ system, forthcoming pri-
maries, national convention, and

current political issues affecting”

the 1964 presidential election.

Broad Scope

The informal courses are de-
signed to offer a broad scope of
subjects in the‘. arts, world and
local affairs, conversational lan-
guage skills, as well as subjects
of a practical nature.

Such new courses as “Nine-
teenth Century Russian Novel,”
“American Painting,” “Intro-
duction to Philosophy,” and
“Development of Human Be-
havior,” are being introduced.
Courses on subjects of topical
concern are being offered under
such titles as “Economic Pro-
blems of the Pittsburgh Re‘-7
gion,” “American Foreign
Policy in South Asia,” and
“Africa '64.”

The number of courses and en-
rollment has risen from .135 stu-
dents enrolled in 5 courses in
1957 to 1306 students in .31 cours-
es, last trimester. Married couples
and persons over‘ 65 -years of age
pay a reduced registration fee. “

Speaking to a group of campus student leaders at an informal luncheon last
jTuesday in his Cathedral ofﬁce, Chancellor Litchﬁeld askedif anyone had any ideas
as to why the fall and spring convocations were so poorly attended by students. He
;was" primarily concerned with the spring convocation to which the University has
brought year after year speakers of international renown especially for

' A few years ago students packed the Student Union to hear the late Aldous
Huxley not because they were“ interested in his lecture but because his books are fam-

he’s spent a minimum of 125 A

trimester, he probably spends
an entire day just reviewing for

’ he’ll have only one day to pre-

last hourly as well as go over
an entire term’s work. No mat-

can’t do -much more than race
through his notes; he’ll never

So, professor, tell me "that

Big Brother . . .

1984 In .1964  

C By Marvin Zelkowitz

Monmouth College is a small co-educational school near West
Long Branch, New Jersey. It is like most small schools. But there is

‘ one important difference between Monmouth College and every other

college and university in the United States, or for that matter, the
rest of the world. The girls are. under constant
surveillance while in the dormitories.

». Girls; who complain about the sign-in system
here should be thankful they don’t_ attend. Mon-
mouth. The New. Jersey college’ has television

girls’ dormitory, in addition to a camera trained
on the entrance hall. , - —

This system permits Mrs. Edith Keiser, head
resident of the dorm, to watch and ‘ listen to the
coeds as they go through all their daily "routines.

This system is not very different from the one described by‘

George Orwell in 1984. The only difference is that "people working
for Big Brother are ﬁctional, while the people working for Little
College President are real. ' V

The most terrifying aspect of Orwell’s novel is the lack of
personal privacy’. This same system exists in an American college.

Orwell’s predictions are becoming reality.’ But they are not be-
coming reality in Red China or Russia. They are becoming reality
in an American institution of higher learning. They are a part
of college life at Monmouth. A

One of the primary purposes of college life is to educate, to
transform children from the darkness of ignorance into adults in the
light of truth. The college should teach students to be their own
guides, to be able to make their own decisions.

Monmouth College seems to have forgotten the goals of college

life. It has such tight control over its coeds, that it can even observe

them when they sleep or listen to them sing in the showers.

But Monmouth College is not unique in the United States. A
similar system exists in many high schools. Taylor Allderdice High
School in Squirrel Hill has a similar snoop system, sans video portion.
Each room in the building is ﬁtted with a microphone and speaker
that can only be controlled by the master snooper in the main office.

Many teachers resent the system, saying that it poses a constant '

threat to their teaching. They never know when they are being
audially observed. .

Attorney General'Robert Kennedy wants a similar typeof sys-
tem legalized. It is called wire-tapping. The attorney-general wants
tap evidence admissible in court. '

People have a right to privacy. Most take‘ this right for granted.
That is why we live in private homes, private, apartments, and why
we stay in private hotel rooms whenwe travel. We ‘don’t live in
hostels and communes. If we were to, awake one morning to ﬁnd
someone sitting inour room, we would probably call the police. Yet
a similar situation,’ using microphones instead of people, already
exists in an American college. A student never knows when he is
being observed. A

All of the mechanisms needed to implement theprohibition of
free speech are in the present American schools. All Monmouth or
Taylor Allderdice needs now is some statement of policy, prohibiting

the teaching of,‘ say, the Communist Manifesto. The system would.

be complete. »
The girls at Monmouth still have privacy when they go out, but
the administration apparently has such faith in its carefully selected

‘students that it may be tempted to send chaperons along with them
, on .their_.,da—tes.‘ ' I ‘

The Panther gymnastics team will begin a rugged season
tomorrow at the Feld House at 1 p.m. when they meet Syra-
cuse University. The Orangemen are the defending Eastern
Intercollegate GymnasticsfLeague champion.

This season may prove rougher¢
for the Orange, however, as they
will be without two of their for-
mer stars. Both Corky Voas and
Ray Grimaldi have graduated and
their loses will be felt. Each won
an individual championship last
March in the EIGL competition.

at the Field House against the
Butler YMCA. “The competition
is not intercollegiate but infor-

that it can have a full schedule
this year. The fee is $3 a month

ONLY FORD-BIIILTCARS MEET THE CHALLENGE WITH
TOTAL PERFORMANCE’!   I

Something wonderful’s happened to Ford Motor
Company cars! Under the freshest styling seen in
years, there’s' a new kind of durability and vigor that
more than meets the demands of today’s and tomor-
row’s high—speed turnpike driving conditions.

merit Award for engineering excellence which “superbly
combines the prime essentials of great automobiles.--‘
performance, reliability, durability, comfort and safety."

Total performance makes a world of difference. Bodies
and frames are solid and quiet even on the roughest
roads. The ride s so smooth, so even—keeled, it seems
to straighten the curves and shorten the miles. And
nothing matches the spirit, sparkle and stamina of
advanced Ford-built V—8’s and thrifty Sixes. Total
performance is yours to enjoy in all our 1964 cars-hfroin
the frisky Falcon to the matchless Lincoln Continental.
