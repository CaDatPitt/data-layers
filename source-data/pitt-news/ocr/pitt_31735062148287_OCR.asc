Student Hiring

Lags This Year

Although sales in Pittsburgh de-
partment stores last month showed a
16 per cent increase over those of
November, 1938, little increase in
theidemand for student employment
during the Christmas season is ap-
parent, Robert S. Warwick, assistant
director of the University student
placement bureau, observed this
week. ,

In spite of the rise in department
store turnover, student employment
lagged mainly because stores were
utilizing their old ﬁles in the Christ-
mas, employment rush, Warwick in-
dicated.

The assistant employment head
pointed to the “big year” of 1937
when opportunities for student em-
ployment far exceeded the present
dem,‘an‘d. _ '

' 1 Student Fund Show
Drop in Collections,
Pledges This Year

Community Chest ﬁgures for the
University show a marked decrease
over those for the same period last
year, J. G. Quick, registrar and Uni-
versity chairman for the Community
fund, noted in announcing the ﬁrst
results of the concentrated student
drive last week.

Student pledges and contributions

averaged slightly over $700 each, to-

taling $1,450.54 as against $2,592.58
for the same period lastlyear, Mt.
Quick stated. He ‘added that the

Thanksgiving  jvae-t-.,. ,

counted for the drop in collections
and that the follow-up on. the con-
centrated campaign might bring the
student subscriptions up to $2,700
quota.

Faculty contributions for the same
period also lag behind. This year
$5,618.75 was subscribed. This is
$340 less than last year, according to
the registrar’s ﬁgures.

Subscriptions this year are thus
$1,482 behind last year.

Students who have not yet con-
tributed to the Campus Community
Chest are requested to do so at the
YMCA or YWCA offices. The stu-
dent Campus Chest, besides aiding
the general Community fund, devotes
75 per cent of its funds to student
welfare projects: the loan funds, the
Y’s, and Pitt-in-China.

Over half the student quota re-
mains to be subscribed,‘if the Univer-
sity is to fulﬁll its Community fund
quota of $10,000, Mr. Quick announc-
ed. The entire quota was slightly
oversubscribed last year, although
student contributions only averaged
96 cents instead of the $1 the quota
is based on. ’

Later student subscription reports
will show better returns, since the
professional schools have not yet
completed their returns.

 Unknown Prowler‘
Steals Campus Drive
 Funds From Oﬂice

Between 4:30 and 8 o’clock last
Wednesday morning an uni.dentﬁed
person broke into the YMCA oiﬁce,

-83.4 Cathedral, and stole an unknown

number of envelopes containing Com-

rjnunity Fund materials and subscrip-

tions.
 The thief gained access to the of-

ﬁce by breaking the glass door and

turning the knob from the inside.
Time of the robbery was‘ determined
after the rounds made at 4:30 o’clock
by the night watchman, who report-
ed that the door had not been broken.
 As far as can be determined, the

ithief was able to enter the outer

f A r leadingto the‘. suite ofofﬁces. in
the east wing of the eighth ﬂoor
without breaking it, although he was
forced to smash the panel of the door
leading to the main oﬁice of the
YMCA.

Receipts were placed in the office
Tuesday evening following the end
of the second day’s drive for student
contributions.

No accurate statement of the loss
could be made because the subscrip-
tions had not been counted, although
Harold Viehman, assistant secretary
of the YMCA, estimated the amount
at approximately $150. Pittsburgh
police were not notiﬁed of the rob-
bery. I

Student Opera

Four campus organizations will
combine this spring to present the
ﬁrst student opera in the history of
the University, announces Mrs. Mil-
dred C. Lissfelt, director of Wo-
men’s Choral.

Although the Women’s Choral has
taken the initiative in the produc-
tion of the opera “Dido and Aeneas,”
male voices will be selected from the
Men’s Glee Club, dancing parts will
be directed by WAA, and the music-
al selections by a string ensemble
from the University Orchestra.

Tryouts for the various parts in
the opera will begin Friday, after
which rehearsals will follow through
until the performance on April 10.

The opera, based upon the legen-
dary romance of Dido and Aeneas,
was composed by the English music-
ian Henry Purcell and was ﬁrst per-
formed about the year 1689. The
ﬁrst production took place at a school
for girls kept by Josias Priest in
Chelsea.

In early performances, all the
characters, except Aeneas, probably
were presented by the girls of the
school, Mrs. Lissfelt states. All the
parts are in the treble clef except
that of Aeneas, which is in the tenor

According to Mrs. Lissfelt the
opem itself has a dramatic poignan-
cy and beauty rarely, if ever sur-
passed. It is one of the most beauti-
ful of the 17th century; and even
though Purcell lived earlier than
Mozart and many of the other great
composers, his ‘work is still compar-
able to them.

  Pitt Students Reverse
14 University Tradition

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS REVERSED a Pitt tradition last
week." ":I).1.1.1‘:iI.1g‘ the last few years, the University has been the pace-
setter among Pittsburgh’s institutions of higher learning in helping

. to“1answer.human needs through the Community Fund. But last week
Pitt students failed miserably in their support hf the Campus Com-

munity Chest, contributing only 54 per cent of their quota.

 -From the records of past years, it is obvious that the student
quota of a dollar per person was not too high. Any person who can
aiford to come to the University can afford this amount from his
personal budget. Until this year, Pitt students met this standard.

Because of the unprecedented drop in student receipts this

.year,the Campus Chest drive may be continued. It is still possible,

of course, for students who were not reached through classes last

 Week to make their contributions through University offices.

This year ’s failure in the Campus Chest drive evidences a spirit

iiof irresponsibility which is becoming evident in today ’s student gen-
‘ eration. 1

Historian Describes’ University.

As Part of ‘American Way’

By Nancy Welfer

Business’ growing dependence upon brain rather than brawn is the text
of an article entitled “Democracy at Work” by James Truslow Adams, his-
torian who was awarded an honorary degree by the University last year, in

Barron’s, the national ﬁnance weekly in the November 6 issue.
Pittsburgh is a striking example of this, according to Mr. Adams, as he
points out the working together of the mills in “the valley” and the labora-

tories on “the hill.”
descriptions of the steel mills and

of Mellon institute are the following
paragraphs on the University.

“There was another aspect of
Pittsburgh which interested me in-
tensely, its democracy, what we ‘old’
Americans like to think of as ‘the
American way.’ On the ‘hill,’ among
other institutions is the University
of Pittsburgh, with Chancellor Bow-
man, one of the outstanding Amer-
icans of today, at its head and with‘ a
strong group about him. In his Re-

deﬁned democracy as a splendid way

of creating opportunities for one an— .

a description of all its work nor of
the buildings. So well have Pitts-
burghers worked together for this
ideal of democracy that Dr. Bowman
has been able to raise $9,000,000

above normal revenue since the de-'

pression started.

“The central building, the mag-
niﬁcent ‘Cathedral of Learning,’ is
an inspiration and embodies new
ideas. I was particularly interested
in what are called the Nationality
Rooms, class’ rooms each furnished
and decorated by one of the many
foreign groups who make up the
working population of the city. In
each of these the Germans, Ruman-

.ians, Czechs, Hungarians, Chinese,

Ruthenians and many others have
striven to express to the students
who use them what is the best con-
tribution which their particular race
can make to the common culture of
a united American democracy. The
12,000 or so students come from
every state in the Union, but the
great bulk of them from the working
class of Pittsburgh itself, largely
from the steel mills.

“Here is where democracy is ac- ‘

tively at work. There have been

princely gifts such as from the Mel-

Chesterfield  
holds the Record

Included in the‘

I shall not here attempt’

lons and from Howard Heinz, who
gave the Heinz Chapel, one of the
most beautiful buildings in the
world, where vision has transmuted
proﬁts from pickles into an ever-
lasting contribution to the aspiring
spirit of men. But in the building
of this ‘university for the people’
there are two incidents about which
I most like to think. »

“When the Chancellor was strug-
gling to make a great university out
of an ancient academy, a group of
workers in the steel industry offered
him a contribution of some thou-
sands, which he thought far beyond
their means. They explained it was
all their savings for some years past,
but they wished to help build the
university as it would spell oppor-
tunity for their children. He ac-
cepted on condition that if they ever
needed the money he would see that
they got it back. None has ever
asked for a cent of it.

Editor, the Pitt News:

Last Thanksgiving was a day set
aside to offer up our thanks for what
we have received during the past
year. In making my thanks, I really
had something to be thankful for. It
was my possession of good health.

I have had ear trouble which had
baffled specialists beyond cure. When
I enter the University, I immediately
consulted Dr. Carlson of Student
Health Service. In two weeks, he
did what specialists have been un-
able to do for years.

A thankful freshman,

ﬁx. I ‘Cassiano, Dickinson, Kristufek,Klein

Selected as Panther Representatives
On Talented All-City Grid Aggregation

For the ﬁrst time in Pa Pitt’s long gridiron memory, names of
Duquesne grid stars equal a Pitt representation on a Pitt News all-

city eleven.

Despite the fact that the Dukes’ schedule has not included the
teams of major calibre appearing on the Panther and Skibo cards,
the victories of the Bluffmen over their two neighbors warrant their

eight places on the 22 man squad.
After a heated debate among the

News sports writers, Buff Donelli’s

two pony halfbacks, brother Allen

Donelliv and sopho- M
m o r e B e r n i e
Semes, were both
named in the ﬁrst
ba c k fie l-d. Ben

Kish’s record until
his injury rated
him above this
pair, but coupled
with their sterling
performance la s t
Saturday, his ‘-
broken leg rele-
‘gates him to the
second team.

“D a n d y Dick” '
CasCsiano,ithe D0391“
Panthers’ scholarly ball-carrier, and
Merlyn Condit, Tech‘ ground gainer
and punter deluxe were unanimous
choices for the other two backﬁeld
‘slots. ‘

An honest-to-goodness quarterback
-or. fullback is missing from this star
«quartet, but Cassiano would make a
-great signal-caller", and it is doubt-
ful whether any in the foursome
would be better at crashing for two
yards and a ﬁrst down.

’ On the line, there is little room for
argument "at any of the ﬁrst team po-
sitions. Johnny Schmidt’s rangy
frame stands head and shouldert
above an otherwise mediocre crop of
centers. The Tartan snapperback has
been in every game up to his neck
and didn’t commit a woolly pass all
season.

At the guards, Bill Rieth, great
Skibo senior, and Harold “Butch”
Klein, Pitt stalwart, get the nod.
Rudy Gradisek, Pitt junior, blossomed
-out late in the campaign, but Klein's

.equalled any end’

covering punts.

experienced play was better over the
span covered by a nine game sched-
ule. Rieth was the only.Tech lineman
“in” the later games with the excep-
tion of Schmidt.

Frank Kristufek, Charley Bowser’s
senior tackle, and Carl Nery, the
Night Riders’ jack-of-all trades, are
able guardians of the tackle posts.
Kristufek’s brilliant work in the

‘ Duke and Tech games produced the

season’s best tackle play.

‘Nery, performing, with equal suc-
cess at guard, tackle, and end, spent
most of his Saturday afternoons in
opposing backﬁelds. Ted Konetsky
would undoubtedly have been award-
ed top recognition, had injuries not
shelved him the greater part of the
year.

The wingmen that were selected
would keep any coach’s hair from
turning gray. Johnny Dickinson, a

great opportunist, ——-—---—-~"'

dium all season at;

Charley Bowser r
termed him “the;
best end in Pit "
history.”
Johnny Rokis-‘
key, a smart ball
hawk and p a s s
snatcher, gives the
talented pigskin ‘
array an able plac
kicker. He has
missed but one
conversion thus far, and last Satur-
day booted a 26-yard ﬁeld goal.
1 ‘As is the case with any “all” team,
many will disagree with these choices,
but the ‘News challenges anyone to
pick a better club.

Of Panther Gridders’ 1939 Record

By Bert Jaffe
“Far above Cayuga ’s waters”

or to be exact in Ithica, New York

is Cornell university. The football team representing this institu-
tion receives our vote as the outstanding grid aggregation of the 1939

season.

Some will argue that Tennessee, Duquesne, or Southern Califor-

nia can top the Big Red, and they

may be right. However, our diag-

nosis revolves around the destiny of¢

Pitt’s football schedule which found
the Bowsermen battling representa-
tives from the east and south, mid-
west, and the far west.

Three Wins And-

Four teams overpowered Pitt’s‘
aerial minded Panthers, who started
the season with but two regulars of
the 1938 team back in school.

Three quick victories by the Gold-
en Panthers had the alleged experts
in a dither, and Pitt received the
number one rating after its surpris-

ing triumph over the Blue Devils of

Duke. -

Pitt’s jinxed fourth game pitted
the Panthers against the Duquesne
Night Riders. A costly fumble
bounced into the hands of onrushing
Duquesne end who romped over for
a touchdown and the Dukes won
their second victory over the Jungle
Cats, repeating their 1936 perform-
ance.

Fordham Rammed

With the Polo grounds in New
York serving as the stage, Fordham’s
actors, ‘starring Blumenstock, Prin-
cipe, and Dennery in leading roles,
won the applause of the home town
audience with a stirring 27-13 vic-
tory. Again it was fumblitis that
changed the plot of the story.

The third team to twist the Panth-
er’s tail was the Nebraska Cornhusk-
ers. However, the Jungle Cats did
sandwich in two wins previous to this

defeat, one over Temple, and a last ‘

minute Horatio Alger triumph over
The ﬁnal score of the Ne-

At approximately the same mo-

So the asterisk in the faculty di-" N

Miss M‘cLaughlin’s identiﬁcation

pened; Penn State ended a 20-year
non-victory campaign against the
Panthers with a 10-0 win that left
State College, Pennsylvania, in an
uproar over the week-end and an
official holiday. on Monday.

State whipped the Panthers from
-the opening kick-oﬁ to the ﬁnal
whistle of the game. Never before
in this season had the Pitt footballers
received such a lacing in statistics,
spirit, and ﬁnal score. Another tri-
umph for State’s defense throws
them into the same class as last year’s
Duke Iron Men, the last team to hold
Pitt scoreless previous to Saturday’s
game.

Page Ripley

This season had a touch of Robert
L. Ripley’s “Believe it or Not” as-
pect. It was sweet revenge for the
Panthers in defeating Duke and
Tech, the only two teams able to stop
Dr. Sutherland’s ﬁnal edition last
season.

The sports writers can now forget
how Bob Higgins caught a shortcpass
and traveled ' 80-odd "yards for a
touchdown in State’s last win over
Pitt until this year." 3 ‘

fared much better as messengersof
good will than as cross country rim-

York. Coach Carl Olson’s squad be-
came the ﬁrst University of Pitts-
burgh student delegation to pay a
visit to Dick Fullerton since his con-
ﬁnement to a New York hospital
after injuries received in the Ford-

Coach Olson and student trainer
Herman Bearzi represented the

team, for the stricken Pitt center

The remainder of the squad pooled
some money and had the coach and

half.

And anotherodd bit of work that
has produced unpleasant results for
Pitt rooters has to ‘do with a sports
reporter on a local daily.

It seems that our sports writing
friend has only viewed four Panther
games this season. The games he
failed to see included Washington,
West Virginia, Duke, Temple, and
Carnegie Tech, and the Panthers
emerged on the top in each of these
frays. The puzzle is just What four
games did he see, and how did Pitt
fare in each of these games?

Cornell Over State .

Getting back to our why and
wherefores concerning the Big Red
of Cornell, need we say more than
the score between Cornell and Penn
State. The Snavely-coached eleven
trounced State, 47-0. (And a certain
news prognosticator picked State to
win that game.)

 t‘i‘onal Exposition of ‘Cinematographic
i ,Art.

 No actors were used in the ﬁlm;
only-L. natives of the river valley ap-
pear. , Sixteen states, from Minnesota
to Louisiana, were used as location
scenes of this ﬁlm which takes the
facts of reality and dramatiz-es them

, into a production of compelling force.

Not only is’ this ﬁlm a story of
what the river has done and what
men have done to it, but it is a
presentation of the mistakes of the

, past together with suggestions for the

future to prevent future timber and

.soil losses and ﬂood disasters.

Actual scenes of the Ohio-Missis-
sippi valley ﬂoods taken by the pic-
ture’s camera crew are used. Rescue
work done by Coast Guard workers,
army. engineers, and others is record-

I I ed for permanent recognition of the

results of the valley’s greatest ﬂood.

Thomas Chalmers, an actor, reads
the ‘poetic narrative to the musical
background p r e p a r e d by Virgil
Thompson and recorded by a group of
musicians from the Philharmonic or-
chestra of New York, under the di-
rection of Alexander Smallens.

_, The Langmuir picture demonstrates
some of his researches in surface
chemistry which won him the coveted
award for chemistry in 1932. Latest
applications of his discoveries, includ-
ing invisible glass, perfected by Dr.
Catherine Blodgett, his assistant, are
also recorded.

This picture is the ﬁrst in a series
on the winners. of the Nobel prize
which are being made by the Ameri-
can Institute of Motion Pictures. The
series 4' is titled “The Living Hall of
Fame.”

PROVIDENCE, R. I. ——- (ACP)-—
New England college students will
soon be the ﬁrst in the country to

tertainment for listeners and experi-
ence for radio-minded students hand-

terest. and other colleges and universi-
ties are being invited to join.

Why did Artie Shaw quit last week? “ Politics, corruption and
a system of patronage aren't the only things a musician has
to ﬁght,” says the King of the Clarinet. “What’s worse are
one-night stands and long, brutal jumps that wreck a man’s
health.” Here’s his fantastic rags-to-riches’ climb. . .from 47¢
