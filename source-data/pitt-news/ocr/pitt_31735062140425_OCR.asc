  ‘Rush Attends
Dinner Meeting

At White House

By BETTY McMAHAN

Returning Friday from a dinner- -
‘ meeting in the White House held to

discuss the urgent need to train
young people in the, practices and
principles of democracy, Helen Pool
Rush, acting dean of women, said,
“It was one of the most charming
and stimulating experiences I have
ever had.”

Describing the White House,
Miss Rush said it was beautifully
decorated with red car-nations, red
roses, and white snapdragons. The
official state dining room where
the dinner was served, was espe-
cially lovely, with high paneled
walls, dark green velvet drapes and
small pink rosebuds on the tables.
A At the speaker’s table were: Mrs.

Franklin D. Roosevelt; Chief Jus-
tice and Mrs. Harlan Stone; secre-
tary of the Treasury and Mrs. Mor-
genthau; Justice and Mrs. Felix
Frankfurter; Mr. and Mrs. Archi-

V bald MacLeish; Dr. George Shus-

‘cer, president of Hunter college;

Dr. William Neilson, former presi- *

dent of Smith college; and Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Straight. The rest of
the 94 guests sat in groups of five
at separate tables.

Stressed at the‘ meeting, accord-
ing ‘to Miss Rush, was the need for
democracies to train their youth in
the ideological zstruggle against
Naziism. “Fascism," said one
speaker, “bases its hope for preser-

vation on the indoctrination of its

youth with its basic concepts. De-
mocracy must, if it is to survive,
do likewise.” _
The Intercollegiate Student Gov-
ernment association and the Inter-
national Student service, both of
which maintain connections with
almost all colleges and universities,
.were cited as organizations which
could be used as focal points in es-

salesmen opening the annual sales
to «undergraduate students.

“Where's Kelley,” famous le-
gion convention cry, refers ’to Bill
Kelley, popular blind senior, and
to Pete ‘Kelley’ his dog and crin-
stantlcompanion, who have offered
to assist in selling the 1942 Owl to
undergraduates.

Don Lingenfelter, BA44, assist-
ant circulation manager and di-
rector of the sales drive, stated to-
daythat the deposit of one dollar
on the $3.50 total price of the Owl
may be made at the booth“in the
ground floor elevator lobby any af-

ternoon this week. Students may’

also purchase the book directly
from one of the salesmen. The bal-
ance is due when the Owl comes out

N Theme of the yearbook this year
is “Hand in Hand at Pitt" and the
six sections of the book will each
be introduced by photographs of

of that/:, division. The military at-
mosphere of Pitt will be exempli-
fied but it will be only incidental to
the main theme. ..
“The makeup of the Owl has
been altered to include photographs
and writeups of all campus events
resulting from the war and photo-
graphs of Pitt men in service will
also be included,” John Brosky,
C42, editor said ‘today. ’

Tom VVeste1'-man, BA42, business
manager, added, “We feel that un-
dergraduates and seniors alike will
want the yearbook this year due to
the uncertainty of the present sit-
uation and the possibility that it
may mean temporarilythe suspen-
sion of many student friendships
because of service in the armed
forces.”

“The total cost of the Owl to un-
dergraduates is only $3.50 with
one dollar of it payable now. The
balance is due when the Owl comes
out the week of April 20.’_’

Red Cross Drive
Fails To Reach

   

Pitt's student Red Cross drive
did not reach its $1,500 goal and
probably will not, according to ﬁg-
ures . received date Friday after-
noon. The actual amount collected,
including expected proceeds from
the Red Cross dance, was approx-
imately $800, one-half of the goal.

About $550 of the amount col-
lected came from student contribu-
tions, according to Thomas Wes-
terman, BA42, chairman of the
drive. Of this $550, only about
$380 was collected from individual
students, the remainder coming
from organizations on the campus,
'Westerman said. \

The drive was carried on for an
entire week at the University.
Workers appeared at several points
throughout the campus to solicit
student contributions of 25 cents.

Schools of Dentistry and Phar-
macy each contributed $100. Each
student in these schools gave 25
cents.

Twenty organizations that con-
tributed were listed in Friday’: Pitt

money.

The Red Cross dance committee
was hampered by conflicting fra-
ternity activities, according to
Mabel Moore, C43, chairman of the
dance. Proceeds from the Victory
dance were turned over to the drive
after expenses were deducted.

The faculty drive, separate from
the student effort, did not have any
set quota. A member of each de-
partment and school in the Univer-
sity solicited the faculty members
in his department for 9. contribu-
tion. Figures to date show that
over $1,700 has already been col-
lected.

According to J. G. Quick, Uni-
versity registrar and chairman of
the drive, each person represented
in the drive contributed an average
of $3.77. These ﬁgures include the
administration and clerical stall’.

No deﬁnite datelha-s been set to
end the faculty drive and contribu-
tions are still coming, Mr. Quick
stated.

A nine—point plan has been ap-
proved by the executive committee
of the “Buy a Battleship” drive
at the first regular meeting last
Thursday.

The plan .organizes and outlines
the local campus drive to raise
funds through the *purchase of de-
fense stamps, the proceeds to ‘help
defray the cost of building the bat-
tleship Iowa. '

District officials of the United
States Treasury department are
considering lending federal sup-
port and publicity to a national ex-
tension of the local plan, accord-
ing to Herbert Gall, M43, chair-
man of the committee. Such pub-
licity would be conducted by gov-
ernment agencies ' through news-
papers, radio, and movies.

Commenting on this “atlzractive
and easy way of making aisound in-
vestment and of aiding the govern-
ment at: the same time,” the first

'Present Emergency Increases Need

For Hospitalization ---Dr. Jamison

Ed~itm"s note:

Following  the third, of a series
of articles about student hospital-
izatiooz, omd insuwmce for hospital
care which .cove—rs everything from
illness to air raid injuries. The

story today discusses the need for i

this service because of the war.

The present emergency has great-
ly increased the need for student
hospitalization, Dr. vAuleene M.
Jamison, director of the Student
Health Service for Women empha-
sized today.

“The generosity of the Pitts-
burgh Hospital Service association
in allowing year-round hospital in-
surance for students make: avail-
able care that will be the more im-
portant because of the accelerated
school program and the war eltort
in general," said Dr. Jamison.

“The great demand for doctors
and nurses will cause diﬂiculty in
obtaining proper home care in case
of illness. At the same time, how-
ever, hospitals will be more thor-
oughly manned to meet .the need.
Consequently, hospital care will be

To  Seek Q Title  

One of the fastest ﬁelds in the
“hislzory of the Millrose games is the
barrier that Coach Carl Ol.son’s in-
door track machine will have to
overcome this Saturday, when they
roll‘ into Madison Square Gardens
for the annual aﬁ.’air in quest of

j some of the spoils.

As in thepast years, the ag-

'.,_ gregation of spikers that willbe

_ opposing the Jungle Cats is drawn

in the country. According to re-

 ports from the director of the

meet, representatives of the west-
ern universities, which always boast
of crack teams, will be there in

It has iilways been a habit with
coaches to prime their teams for

' the Millrose encounter. And this

‘year is no exception. Among those
mentors of national fame, who
have the reputation of consistent-
ly drawing ‘ up top-notch track
squads will be Billy Hayes of.‘ the
University of», Indiana, Bill Novak
oil’ Army and Chick Werner of.’
Penn State. With a board of track
strategists such as those entering
teams, anything and everything is
apt to happen.

However, all these reports have
not affected the local squad one
bit. There is no reason to get ex-
cited, because Pitt will have two
‘of the fastest sprinters who ever
put on a pair of track shoes in
“Bullet” Bill Carter and “l"lap"
Sticlcel. These two can hold their‘
awn-. inany one’s game, according
to "therecord they have carved in

Phi Kap Quintet

To 38-31 Win

Top teams in the intrainural bas-
ketball race came through with
victories lastoTllursday night‘ to
continue one of the closest races in
years. The rampaging Phi Kaps,
who are sharing first place with a
revamped Phi Gam quintet, did not
look too good on beating a com-
paratively weak Phi Delta Theta
team 38-31.

The winners were paced by Joe
Connell, who is becoming one of
the most dangerous men in the
league, while the Phi Delt top man
/was Larry Braner. Both men had’
twelve points.

Frank Carver, Intramural direct-
or, announced today that 3. table-
tennis tournament: was being plan-
ned, for non-fraternity men. Fur-
ther details will be printed in later
editions of the News. l A

In the only other fraternity game
of the evening third-place Theta
Chi defeatecl the ﬂoundering Delts,
52-34. This Theta Chi squad, the
only one capable of beating the’
feared Phi Kaps, is in third place
only because they have played few-
er games than any other team in
the league. . .

Bill Fitchko was high man in
last week's battle with 17 points,
while Bill Patterson paced the Delts
with 11.

The other three regularly sched-
uled fraternity. games resulted in
forfeits. The winners were: SAE
over Phi Epsilon Pi; Phi Gamma
Delta over _Pi Lambda Phi; and
PjKA ov-er-‘ SAM. ' :

In the» Independent baslcetball .

league, 2:: new team has stolen the

spotlight. The 'A.C. Boys, largely

a freshman team, beat the lndus-

trials, 68-11, for their third of the
» year.‘ . V V  ,

High man for the, A.C.’s was
Ray Strothman, who wound up
with a total of 29 points. This ﬁg-
ure, coupled with the 26 he made
‘in the only other gzunc he played,
gives Strothman a 2712 Noint av-
erage per game.

In addition to Baric and Kesling,
Raese will probably start Scotty

consist of‘-the usual -starting quin-
tet of Laiiry Paffrath, ‘.-‘Lefty” Ziol-
lcowski, -Jim‘ Egan, Malarlcey, and
Artman.  ‘ .
«It will be 8. point of interest in

Wednesday’s contest to note wheth- i
er La.rry;Paffrath will continue, as T

in the CSTC contest, in the role of
assist man, or instead, will make a

concerted effort to maintain‘ a com-v

fortable lmargin as the district-’S
point scoring leader.

Seven morebattles remain 'on~

the Blue and Gold floorcalendar.
After Wednesday's game, the Pan-
ther quintet has yet to meet ‘ln-
diana State Teachers and West-
minster, on the Stadium court, and
Geneva, Carnegie Tech, Penn State
and Army while on the road.

A victory over the West Vir-
ginians will do much in the way of
helping the.Panthers break that
50-50‘jinx, and start a streak that
could easily save this Panther ﬂoor
season from thg fate ‘of mediocrity.

Port, Former Cage Stair, W
Home To a R€CfUllZ Students

The tali red-headed ﬁgure in the
dull green Marine officer uniform
looked very familiar when he came
into the News ofﬁce last Friday.
Had he been wearing a basketball

uniform he would have looked even ‘i

more familiar, for it was Mel Port,’
star of last year’s championship
Blue and Gold cage squad.

Port, a lieutenant in the Marines,

' came back to Pittsburgh last week

after serving in Quantico, Virginia,
since July. He will be here for two
months on a procurement program
for the officers training school of
the Marines.

Since, his enlistment in the Ma-
rines, Lt. Port said he hasn’t been
able to play any basketball, but
hopes to be able to do so while he.
is in town. He saw the Pitt-Penn
State game, played a few weeks
ago, but had no -comment on the
231119.

The former Panther ace stated
that there were a number of ath-
letes with him in Virginia iiiclud-
ing Mike Enich and Frank. Blatt,
all-American football stars from
Iowa and Ohio State respectively.

j‘London born and educated Dr.
Peter Gray, associate plofessor of
gbiology, has done everything from
running a kitchen in Paris to study-
, ing under some of Europe’s leading
*- scientists at the Imperial College
of Science in London."

 Six generations of the Gray fam-
‘ily have written books about sci-
ence, except for Dr. Gray’s non-
iconformist father who was a nov-
elist. “It was quite natural for me
to be interested in scientiﬁc fields,”
Dr. Gray says, “for at six I was
llcollecting butterflies.”

After graduation from the Im-
perial College of Science, from
which he also received his Doctor
1 of Philosophy degree, he studied at
the University of Edinborough.

.He did research work in the lab-
oratory of ‘the Norwich museum,
and A-while in Scotland received a
. Rockefeller fellowship. He arrived
in New York on January 1, 1939.

quainted with the countries of Eng-

DR. PETER GRAY
“natural” scientist
land; France, Belgium, and Nov-
way. His parents lived in Paris for
many years and he spent his vaca-
tions there. “I have always consid-

ered France a second home,” Dr.

Gray mentioned. He employed his
knowledge of French in writingya

of Scientists

book entitled, “French Grammar ‘
for Science Students.” "

Besidethe French grammar he
has written twenty pap.ers. A

Although he insiststhat his pro-
fessionand his leisure cannot be
separated, and although he is proud
of the scientiﬁc advances he has
made in his home work shop, he is
an enthusiastic photographer and
badminton player.

Fishing is also one of Dr.'Gray's
favorite sports, but due to the fact
that immigrants are not permitted_

. to ﬁsh in Pennsylvania waters he
has not had the chance to do much
of it. 0 .

One of the most annoying phases
of present day life to Dr, Gray is
the popular opinion that immi-
-grants are not affected by the draft.
They are. And he like American
citizens has his classiﬁcation.

“I prefer the American school
system,” he said, “and find the stu-
dents here to be better mannered
t an those abroad, If a professor
w re to deliver an address in an
English university with an accent
as strongly American as mine is
English I am certain that he would
not receive as much respect as I
have found here.” » A
