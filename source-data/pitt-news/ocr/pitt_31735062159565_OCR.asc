a slate of seven women nominated
during ceremonies Tuesday. Results
of the election will be announced
on Tap Day, after which the Queen

University.

Sprigle added that “it is rea-
sonably certain that the University
might be more than willing to make
the proposed crime laboratory a
joint operation of Pitt and the
Pittsburgh Police Bureau.”

Dr. Fitzgerald, without referring
especially to Sprigle’s suggestion,
has said that it is the policy of the
University to weigh and consider
all proposals for its assistance in
the betterment of the community.

But Dr. David B. Rogers, pro-
fessor of sociology doesn't believe
that a crime lab at Pitt is the ans-
wer and uses the results of his
study of the Chicago crime lab to
prove his contention.

Last year Dr. Rogers spent a
week studying the Chicago lab,
one of the three best in the country,

According to Dr. Rogers, North-
western had to sell its laboratory
to the city of Chicago because of
the great expense involved in main-
taining it. Northwestern officials
also complained that the scarcity
of competent lab criminalogists and
the high salaries such men draw
when they are found helped to put
the school’s lab out of business.

Pitt, says Dr. Rogers, would be
in the same difficulty if crime were
undertaken here.One million dollars
would probably be the initial cost
of such a lab, and even after es-
tablishment, it would be extremely
difficult to obtain the kind of men

News Reporter
Clarifies ‘Bone
Of Contention’

(See editorial on page 2)

A bone of contention has been
lodged in the throat of the News
by several residents of Desoto
Hall in regard to Tuesday's arti-
cle on the possibility‘ of a sneak-
thief’s entering the Hall.

And the boys are right. They
contend that. the reporter was
cleared by Proctor Bob Herman,
so he was not bothered on Friday
when the pictures were taken.
This is true, and the reporter ad-
mits that Janitor Garvey Watson
is an unhospitable chap to stran-
gers and probably would have
thrown him out had it not been
for this clearance. _

However the reporter took the
cameraman along only to record
what he had seen the day before.
Thursday Janitor Watson was
washing windows so the pseudo-
thief got away with murder. No
reflection on the janitor was in-
tende in e story.

Student Congress changed, then
reconsidered, and finally found it-
self with three major alterations in
its constitution at last Monday’s
meeting.

Contingent upon the students’
approval at the Spring elections,
Congress will no longer have a
nominating committee of dual-office
holding. Men and women will vote
jointly for all Congress represen-
tatives.

The doing-away with the nomin-
ating committee and the prospec-
tive joint election are results of an

Competent crime laboratory
workers need not only a thorough
grounding in pure science but
i in the field
of applied crime detection. To em-
ploy inferior workers in such a lab
would be worse than nothing, says
Dr. Rogers._

A far more realistic approach to
Pittsburgh’s need for a crime lab,
according to Dr. Rogers, would be
the establishment of a small-scale
laboratory which could handle most
routine tasks.

EC Nomination
Blanks Available

The nomination petitions for the
Ellsworth Center Student Council
now are available in Room 103 EC,
according to Ken Linamen, EC
elections chairman.

Candidates for the EC Student
Council must have been enrolled
at the Center for at least one sem-
ester and must have maintained a
1.0 quality point average. The
petitions require 25 Signatures and
should be returned before 3:30 p.m.
on March 16.

The revote pulled the amendment
through with an 8-4 count after
Swanson repeated the principle of
he amendment--"the only way a
person can get on the ballot is by
petitioning.”

Joint Election Opposed

The second part of the amend-
ment, the joint election, was op-
posed by Miss Bolger. The amend-
ment is “not consistent” with Con-
gress’ action two years ago when
it stopped a 50-50 representation
of men and women on Congress in
favor of a proportional representa-
tion,she said.

The proportional representation
hasn’t changed, replied Don Ewart.

The amendment does “°‘ alter

‘No’ Studied i

Student antipathy toward the plan
of Helen Pool Rush, dean of women,
which called for an hour and one- V
half free session during the afternoons‘ 0'
for activities was blamed on the Pitt
News by Henry Conner, chairman of
the Student Congress Poll Committee,
at last Monday's Congress meeting.

The poll, which was conducted
through the News, showed 96 per
cent of the 215 usuable ballots op-
posed to the plan. ,

Conner claimed that an editorial in
the News which appeared the same~
day as the poll questionaire and the
story concerning the poll itself ten- ;
ded to bias the student. ~

The editorial told of the advantage 0 .
such a plan would have for students,\
working in accivitiésj. However, it‘
also mentioned the fact that students... 
who are not in activities would lose,
time. _

“The News reference to the pro-
posed program as the ‘Rush Plan’
didn't help it any,” he- asserted.

When questioned by Congress mem-
bers as to the advisability of con- .
ducting a new poll, Conner replied."

 

   
 
   
   
  
  
   
  
 
   
   
  
      
   

"Such conclusive results (96 per.-
cent against) indicate that the stu-
dents are definitely opposed to such
a proposal. A new poll might bring
the percentage down somewhat, but ..
wouldn't change the trend,” he said

The questionnaire in the News was’
printed at Conner's request, and the’
story used material which be supplied?‘

This proposed amendment would
enable Congress representatives to
“give their all to Congress,” ac-

Congress finally passed the a-
mendment with a 7-5 vote. But_ Swan--C

when he discovered that it would
be included as a part of his amend-
ment. . r

Swanson’s motion, however,did”
not receive a majority vote. Then

To Put Tee

Rules For Freshman

By JAC K MARKOWITZ

“Wayward freshmen beware
cry at last Tuesday’s meeting.

Council is establishing a twenty-man squad to look for of-
fenders of the dink program in tuck shops, orientation classes and

in the halls. This motion, made
designed to assure dink-wearing
among freshmen .

Council devoted almost the whole
meeting to,a discussion of the dink
program and how it can be enforced.
The members were unanimous in
their approval‘: of the dink as an im-
portant feature of freshman orien-
tation. - -

Dink Enforcement Poor

But all agreed that the enforce-
fnent of the dink edict left much to
be‘ desired. Edwin ]. McIntosh,
MC_ advisor, said that some upper-
class counselors were not taking
a positive stand on the dinks, and
without counselor backing the dink
_program cannot be successful.

Tom Burkhardt, a member of the
customs and traditions committee,’
‘indicated that some counselors’ are
not completely sold on the program
themselves and are therefore lax in
enforcing it.

Mr. Mcintosh then added that if
counselors cannot be depended
upon to enforce all features of the
orientation program, the counselors
are being hypocritical and the pro-
gram would be better off without
them.

Possibility Investigated
-Dario lcardi ‘was instructed to
investigate the possibilities of at
block of seats at football games
for the freshman class.

Another means of enforcing the
dink edict was suggested to Dick
Shallenberger, mixer dance chair-
man. Shallenberger was asked to
make wearing of the dink compul-

sory for admission to the dances.

position, sponsored by the fine
arts department, will be the largest
enamel show in the history of Pitts
burgh. Examples of both European
and Oriental styles will be repre-
sented.

The exhibition will trace the
development of the decorative art
through‘ the seventh century to mo-
dern times. Several works by Pitt
graduate, Virgil Cantini, are to
be featured.

Cantini twill give a public de-
monstration of enamelling at 8:30
p.m., March 13, in the display
gallery. Also slated. for an appear-
ance, is Dr. Marvin Ross, curator
at the Wasters Art gallery, Balti-
more, who will lecture on the sub-
ject.

Art objects have been donated

Deans Inspect

Proposed Site

0fPlanned Student Center

Grace Church facilities for a proposed student center were in-

spected earlier this week byrthe dean of men and the dean of wo-

II1€I1.

According to Dick Campbell,

chairman of the Student Christian

-Federation which is sponsoring the plans for a center in the

church, the deans on the whole ex-
pressed approval of the building.

Dean Biddle stressed, however,
that an opinion on the building is
not necessarily the same as an
opinion on the suitability of that
building asa center for the students
of the University.

One Room Transfered

The agreement which has‘ been
contracted between the church and
the Student Christian Federation
calls for the transference of only
one room to the SCF for use as an
office andipossibly as a lounge.

iAlong with this, however, goes
the unwritten assurance
Federation will be allowed’ to use

other space in the center wing of.

thejchurch if that space is not pre-
viously allotted to other groups.
Whatever the size of the facili-
ties,however,the«Student Christian
Federation desires to make them
available to all students of the Uni-
versity, says Dick Campbell.

Women Asked to Aid

Before University approval can
be made on the Grace center plans,
the Federation must present an ac-
'ceptable system of supeevision.
At present a group of women is be-
ing asked to help in that connec-
tion, and their reply was to have

that the

‘test between the four» classes.

Each class will be asked to pre-
sent a humorous campaign platform
and song. They will be judged on
originality of thought and presenta-
tion... .

A campaign dinner-forum has
also been suggeste“. The forum
will resemble national testimonial
dinners and willlbe held April 11,
the day before elections. At this
time-representatives from each
class will speak on the do’s and

been forwarded to the Federation
meeting last evening.

A meeting of the dean of men,
the dean of women, and representa-

tives of the SCF. ‘will be _held in

in the near future to determine the
rules and regulations under which

erned, if the plans are approved
by the University. -

the Grace facilities will be gov-‘

don’ts in intelligent voting and the
nominees’ names will be announced.

,The education-for-election pro-
gram is still in the planning stage
and changes will. be made. The
committee is eager to have any sug-
gestions the student body would
like to offer. Any ideas may be
submitted to the chairman, ]erry

SOAP’S ON-George F. McFeaters, building custodian, turns ‘on the

 

soap that will cleanse the grimy paws of students when they push the
buttons in washrooms on the floors below 18.

Riddle of Washroom
Soapsupply Solved  

Ask the average student in a Cathedral of Learning washroom
"Where does the soap come from?” and you will probably get only
‘a puzzled expression for an answer. '
 The veryldependability of the soap dispenser causes it to be
overlooked. We give a little push -- we get a little squirt -- every

time. And so we don’t give it an-
other thought.

But to the scientific observer -
he who cannot merely accept his
squirt with open hand and closed
mind, but must know the why and
the wherefore -- to him that un-
assuming little s ziirt is achallenge.

Looks for Answer
And so, our scientific observer,
when asked “Whence cometh the

soap?” sought out the buildings
and grounds department for an
answer.

From George F.McFeaters, build-
ing custodian, our observer learned
that the sources of the soap are
two 55 gallon tanks located on the
17th and 35th floors.

From the tank on 17, soap flows
through pipes to smaller auxiliary
tanks located on 13, 12, 9, 6, 5, 2,
and ground. From" each of these
tanks in turn soap flows downward
_to all the washroom dispensers on

soap from the 17th floor tank can

 
   
   

the tables and chairs that will be
,set up around the dance floor to
“provide that night club atmosphere.
D Supplying the music for the dance,
will be Charlie Spivak and his band.
7 Orders for the day (or night in this
case) call for plenty of soft, dance-
eable music.
‘ ' Skip Nelson, ex-Glenm Miller
.vocalist, will vocalize during in-
htermission. One of the songs, Nel-
son will sing is "Old Black Magic”
which he made famous with the
Miller Orchestra.

The Ball committee has arranged
for free parking and checking facil-
ities at the dance.

the same floor and on every floor
down to the next auxiliary tank.

Gravity the Answer

When a dispenser is pushed, the
soap flows out of it by the pressure
of the soap in the pipes behind
the dispenser all the way up to the
auxiliary tank. In other words; the
force of gravity is all that makes
the soap come out of the dispenser.

Our observer, therefore, could
easily see why auxiliary tanks are
absolutely necessary, for he could
imagine what would happen to the
poor student who pushes a ground
floor dispenser if behind it would
be the pressure of an 18-floor col-
umn of liquid.

Physicists Investigate    

Curesoirliadiation

By RAY CRISTINA _
Science struck a double blow recently against radiation cata-
racts of the type that virtuallyblinded Pitt Atomic physicist Alex-

ander J. Allen last year.

While surgeons in New York City attempted to complete the
restoration of Dr. Allen's vision, a second Pitt scientist in anoth-

er part of the city received a grant
for the study of radiation cataracts.

The U.S. Atomic Energy Commis-
sion last Monday granted $12,347
to the Pitt Radiation and Addison
ll. Gibson laboratories "to study
the effects of neutrons from a cyc-
lotron on the development of cata-
racts.” . S

Grant Received

Dr. Campbell Moses, director of
the Addison H. Gibson laborator-
ies, said he received the grant on
the same- day Dr. Allen was oper-
ated on for the removal of a second
radiation cataract.

The operation was performed in
the Eye Institute of the Cornell
Presbyterian Medical Center. Dr.
Moses said the Pitt physicist was
"doing very well,” but that it
would probably be several weeks
before the results of the operation
are known. “'

Dr. Allen underwent a similar op-
eration early last July which res-
tored the vision of his right eye.

Danger Lies in overexposure

Radiation cataracts result from
repeated overexposure to atomic
rays at close range over a period
of years. Science has found that
the greatest danger from overexpos-
ure comes from the setting-up phas-
es of cyclotron projects.

Dr. Allenvhelped set up the Pitt
machine in 1947 after many years
of experience with atom-smashers.
The scientist’s vision began to fog
more than a year ago until he be-
came almost completely blind.

An operation on his right eye fol-
lowed and wa"-s termed a "spectac-
ular success" by physicians.

Schools Co-operate

The study of radiation cataracts
here will be made in conjunction
with the Howe laboratory of the
Harvard Medical School, and cyclo-x
trons at‘Ohio State University and
‘(Columbia University.

Fisher, who aided Schmitt with

With his head coach, Len Casa-

Though both men are from Fern-

Casanova was a commander in

charge of athletic and survival
operational training on the West
coast. Meister, after training for

several months in the East on a
diet of worms, herbs, and anything
else handy, to simulate the plight
of a naval pilot forced down on

Fins Can Win Title
If ‘He’ Come True

By STAN SKIRBOLL

With some “ifs” and some luck
the Pitt swimming team will be
crowned Eastern Collegiate Swim-
ming champ tomorrow at New Bruns-
wick, New Jersey, according to
Ben Grady, Panther coach.

"If Jim Zentgraf can take afirsti
in the 220 and 440-yard free style;'
if Dick Petro can take a first in
the 100-yard free style; if the 440-
yard relay team can do the same;
if Jules Melograne can place in
the 50-yard free style; if Bob Gover
can place in the breast stroke; and
if Al Ciocca can keep his diving
title, I think we can do it,” said
Grady with a smile.

Three Good Bets

Ciocca, Petro, and Zentgraf are
the best bets to bring valuable
points to the Pitt score sheet.
Ciocca, who won the diving title
last year, is the chief Panther per-
former. M

Grady has had his team tapering
off during the week, but five of the
squad members entered the AAU-
AMA meet last Sunday at the Irene
Kaufmann Settlement.

Revenge Possible

Although Zentgraf was beaten
out in the 220-yard free style by
Bob McCarty, his time still broke
the existing record, and was fast
enough possibly to make one of
the “' come true.

Tartans Not
Bored With

The Carnegie Tech Tartan,

thanked two Pitt divers for com-
ing over and using the Tech pool.

Since the YMHA springboard
is too low for divers Al Ciocca

permission to use the Tartan
board.

The Panther divers were thank-
ed by The Tartan for helping

Weinstein, Andy Brinsko, and
Andy Moranz are the big guns of
the Dukes’ attack. Btinsko was a
JV man at Duquesne High, and
Moranz was an all-around athlete
at Ambridge excelling in football.

A standout can’t be picked from
the Phi Ep unit as each player is
a potential game-breaker.

Sam Shapiro’s aggressive play
was the highlight of the faculty Die-
hard victory, which was a major
test for the fraternity men, since a
fraternity squad’s spi_rit outside of
the IF play usually decreases

Tip-in Strength
Bob Miller, who plays an out-
standing board galne, is known to
score one to three tip-ins each
game. Jack Goldsmith’s playmaking
and Herb Schultz’s cool shooting

can't be overlooked either. The
Phi Eps are a balanced team.
In the height department, the

squads will pair off rather evenly
in their starting lineups. Centers
Miller and Moranz both tower at
6-3. The Phi Ep forwards slightly
outhead the Dukes; however, the
Dukes compensate for this short-
coming in their guard positions.

On the other hand, the Dukes, who avenged their early seas-
son defeat Monday by downing the Gophers, gained Strength by
acquiring talent from the vast reservoir of Pitt's independent
populous, as the season progressed. .

B5’ BOB BEWERSDORF

Phi Eps, fraternity league champ-
ions eliminated The Has-Beens,
36-33, in the intramural semi-final
playoff Wednesday at Trees Gym to
advance to the all-campus title
game with the Dukes. / 7
The _winners, aided by the able
rebound work of Bob Miller and
Sid Amdur, held a 30-22 third
quarter edge but a desperate Has-
Been rally in the waning minutes, _
of the fourth quarter narrowed the
margin to 32-30. 7
With the two minute rule in effect
the Has-Beens managed to take
the lead for the first time, 33-32,
on a successful foul shot by Center
Ralph Short and a field goal by
by Bob Osterhout in the last 40
seconds of play. ~
The Has-Beens lead didn't last,
long, however. Forward Herb
Schultz put the Eps back in the
lead again when he broke through 1‘
the Has-Been’s shaky man-for-man 3
defense to score on a lay up shot
to make it 34-33.
The Eps began to freeze the ball
and pulled the defense out leaving
the corners open. The Eps took
advantage of this and iced the game
on an under-the-basket field ‘goal,
by Harold Weitz with just five sec-
onds remaining in the game.

The Phi Eps outscored the Has-
Beens from the field, 16-11, and
converted four of 12 foul shots.
The Has-Beens lost the game at
the free throw line making just nine
of 27 charity throws.

It should come as no surprise
that Captain George McCrossin
finished as theleading scorer on
Pitt’s basketball team this sea-
son.

McCrossin held the lead in the
scoring race from the beginning of
the season and wound up with a
total of 251 points. His nearest
rival, George Hromanik, trailed
far behind with 129 points.

Freshman ace, Mickey Zernich
of Aliquippa, led the frosh scorers
with 192 points.

Highlights of the season ‘in-
cluded . Pitt's record-breaking 84
points against Grove City, which
set a school mark, and McCrossin’s
near individual scoring record of
35 points in one game.

Sports Flashbacks

 

By DAVE POLLOCK

PITT CLOSED one of its worst
basketball seasons in history last
Saturday night at West Virginia,
but 20 years ago this month things
were quite different.

The gPanthers were generally
conceded by most experts in 1930
as being the national collegiate
champion. Pitt met the nation’s
best teams andwon 23 of 25 games.

Captain Charley Hyatt finished
his brilliant career with 315 points
bringing his three year total to
909. Hyatt, whom Dr. H.C. Carlson
calls the best basketball player
of all time, defended his turning
professional in a column in The
Pitt Weekly after receiving much
criticism.

* * *

Pitt sport scene had its share of
fireworks.

A petition sent to Athletic Di-
rector James Hagan’ was photostat-
ed and printed in a Pittsburgh
newspaper. The petition set forth a
list of purported grievances against
the athletic C department and was’
signed by nearly all of the Univer-
sity’s freshman football, track, and
basketball players. A strike was
threatened but the storm blew over
in a week.

turn up among his 35 baseball
candidates. 

Runs batted‘ in is what wins ball
games. And hitters are the commod-

Mitterling, in his thirteenth year
as baseball coach, believes that
defensively the Panthers will field
as strong a team as ever.

Fielders Two- Deep

From the fielding standpoint,
the Panthers are at present two-
deep. What the player can do at
the plate will determine this year’s
starters. -

Mitterling said, "Most of these
men are good fieldets, but what a
player does with a bar will be the
most important factor in selecting
a starting lineup.”

When Europeans watch baseball, they go to sleep! ,

March 13, Europe is fast picking up American games.

Mr. Niiler should know, cons

ical education instructor at Tartu I
university in Estonis, and in his
work with the YMCA in Europe.

A native Estonian, Niiler was
graduated from the Tallinn Real
Gymnasia in that country in 1923,
and then came to this country for'
a “Bachelor of Physical Education”
degree from Springfield College,‘
Mass. I

Works with Boys»

He also has studied economics,
theology, psychology and pedagogy
at Tartu and Geneva universities. _
But it is with boys work in physi- ‘
cal education, playground, and
camping that he has centered his
vocation. '

During the years before the war,
Mr. Niiler was the national and
Olympic basketball coach and the
YMCA Student and Estonian Chris-
tian Student Movement secretary. ‘

But war in Europe halted these
activities. When he triedito leave I

very hard life.”

Building

Start of construction on the stu-
dent center and the gymnasium on
the Cathedral campus will not be
speeded up by the $S,000,000loan
recently arranged with the New
York Life Insurance Co.
Yesterday Dr. John Weber, sec-
retary of the University, st’ated that
the sudden influx of construction
funds was in full accordance with
long-range plans to finance the new
buildings and will not necessitate
a new construction schedule. Nego-
tiations between the University
and the insurance company had
been carried for over four months
according to Dr. Weber.
. As it stands now, ground will

not be broken for the two new build-
ings on the campus for about a
year. Dr. Weber said, however,
that architect‘s plans‘ and drawings
would be “pushed ahead”

Work on the field house, the
' third in the group of buildings which
were to be financed separately from
ithe funds obtained in the

was started last summer. After a
short period, however, contract
difficulties cropped up and con-
struction had to stop.

Questioned about the field house,
Emery B. ]ackson,iUniversity co-
ordinating architect, said that the
trouble has been "cleared up” and
work will begin again soon. The
Trimble Co. was awarded the main
contract on the building.

Although the loan will not accel-
erate construction, it might in-
iirectly slow down the work of

rchitects Ingharrr, Boyd, and Pratt.
Under the terms of the agreement
arrived at with the insurance com-
pany, completed plans must be in-
gspected by the company.

Ever disturb a dog during chow
time? Gets kinda sore, doesn’t he?
But not quite sogsore as a bear be-
ing‘ bothered while eating berries,_
says William ll. Krouse, who in-
structs in retail training when he
isn't taking technicolor movies of
North America’s scenic beauty.

Krouse will “present his fifth
series of travelogues at Carnegie
Music, Hall on April 1.27, l‘~7,.a.r«‘ .74.
One day he tried to get close-ups
of a bear. ,For protection Krouse
had only a camera and his feet.
The humming motor of the camera

' irritated old slew~foot, who lit out

after Krouse, now without camera
but with plenty of feet.

Bear Prefers Tserries

“Luckily I was in a field loaded
with berries,” Krouse related, eyes
glancing heavenward. "The bear
evidently preferred the berries to
me, for he stopped chasing‘ me
whenl was nearly exhausted.”

Filming,of all five series of
travelogues has taken Krouse five
years. It has carried Krouse more
than 100,000 miles—by ship and
car, by plane, train, and mule-train.

About the only method of trans— I

portation missed by Krouse is the
dog team. "Not enough snow in
Alaska at the time I was there,”
heexplained.

Another Close Escape

I Mention of Alaska reminded

Krouse of another narrow escape,
which he rates a close second to
the big, bad, berry-eating bear.
“I was traveling down amountain
in Nome on the Kugrach’ railroad,”

he began, reflectively. "The
tracks tilted and turned in every

direction because of muskeg (dirt-
covered ice). We shot down at

about 60 miles per hour with no
brakes. It was about 10 times
worse than a Coney Island roller-
coaster. One good thing, though:
We didn't loop-the-loop.”i

Krouse believes that the most
beautiful sight he has experienced

gues at Music Hall

 

 

WILLIAM H. KROUSE

is the Grand Canyon. He has seen

Satisfaction Gained

The personable, author stated in

an interview that she received a
deep satisfaction upon completion
of the writing. The novel touched
what she termed an “internal ach-
 ing for eternal things.”
I “Writers are born with this,” she
added. “It’s a sort of turmoil of
the soul. I sincerely believe that
all writing is a channel of contact
with this.”

“Kim Dawson” is part of Amy
Fox. With clarity and emphasis,
she tells of the “hellbent christi-
anity” of a small boom town in the
northern Pennsylvania oilfields

 which is the scene of her novel.

The action occurs during ‘the spring

’ of 1865 and the fall,9_f_ 1866.

Mr. Manuel C. Elmer, head of
the sociology department, addres-
sed students interested in S0Ci=
ology and social work Monday,
and told them that sociology
doesn't Prepare on for any par-

. ticular job.

Dr. Elmer said that any student
who majors in sociology should be
a specialist in some other field.
He said, “When I was graduated
with a sociology degree I wasn’t
trainedfor anything in particular."

He went on to say that all stu-
dents should study sociology in
order to understand group activity
and its interrelated parts.

“If one knows sociology he
will be better qualified in his
work, no matter what field he spe-
cialized in,” Dr. Elmer said:

Dr. Elmer ended by saying that
sociology has an important place
in education. It should be placed
side by side with reading; writing,
and arithmetic.
