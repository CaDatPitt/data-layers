the “loyalty” of their staffs.
The reports are due for this
year on Sept. 1. 7
According to Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald, plans are already
underway for preparing the re-
port.

Chancellor Fitzgerald said that
the four schools are working to-
gether on administering the law.
He said the provisions in each
school may differ in detail but
will be essentially the same.

Complying Now Important

The chancellor, who spearheaded
the opposition of the large schools
to the measure, declared:

“Now that the bill has passed,
the University is concerned with
the meth

 

heads of the academic departments
and the divisional heads of the
service departments.”
No Criteria Yet

actly what criteria would be used

individual. He pointed out that
the means for doing so have not
yet been set up. ~ 0

Last Saturday marked the cul-
mination of over a year of‘violent
dispute over the law. The ﬁrst

bill was introduced by Senator -

Albert R. Pechan of Ford City.

It was immediately supported by
veteran groups and patriotic or-

educational and civil rights groups.

Carson AtLast Escapes Death

 

BysJOAN LISOTTO

Herbert L. Carson is tired of
dying.‘ That’s why he is so satis-
ﬁed with his present role in the
forthcoming Pitt Players produc-
tion, “You Touched Me.”

“I’ve died so many times on the
stage,” he said, “that I was be-
ginning to grow weary. This is the

"first time live ever appeared as a

young lover and I ﬁnd making

 

eyes at Sire Delphey thoroughly
enjoyable, to say the least.”
Carson, who transferred from

' Columbia University last fall has,

in his estimation, portrayed more
than his share of tragic characters.
Even‘ in‘ dramatic productions in
the Service, he wasn’t able to ob-
tain a role in which the character
lived during the entire show.

Purdy Plugs Political

Presents Case Today

The battle for student political clubs on campus opens

today.

The student-faculty Committee on the Recognition of
Student Organizations is going to hear sophomore Dan Purdy

\ I .
Debators Place
  11' d ' M
T 1r in eet

Pitt debaters captured ‘ third
place ‘in the State Championship
Debating Tournament held at Le-
high University last Friday.

Competing with 37 Pennsylvania

colleges and universities,’ Pitt’s
team missed second place by only

‘two points in the semi-ﬁnals. The

award fell to the University of

Pennsylvania which, achieved an e
.38 per cent rating.

Undefeated throughout the tour-
nament, Lud Lippert and T Bob
Gardner, on the affirmative, beat
Penn’s negative argument». Bill
McKinley and Dan Purdy, ' pre-
senting the negative view, lost to
Penn’s aﬂirmative team. V

The decision was made by se-
lecting the median score ratings of
the two teams. V

Going on to the ﬁnals, Penn
again took. ﬁrst place while sec-
ond fell to St. Joseph of Philadel-
phia. Pitt ranked third and Penn
State fourth.

Gpresent the case of the clubs this

afternoon.

Purdy started the whole thing
two weeks ago by introducing to
a meeting of Men’s Council a reso-
lution asking that the University
sanction national political organi-
zations on campus.

Motion Passed

Council passed the motion unin-
imously.

Today, Purdy is asking that a

' HOW MANY muss A DAY '

nized on campus. ' He has contacted

;21 students who have agreed to
back his request for the Taft Club;

“But,” he adds, “I don’t doubt

that many other people would be

interested if the club were recog-
nized and publicized.” '

M Hopes To Set Precedent

Through his action today Purdy
hopes to:

1. Set a precedent for the fu-

'ture recognition of political clubs. ,

2. If he is turned down, he
wants to ﬁnd out what channels a
student must go through to get
University sanction of political
groups. A

First Aid Course a Must
For Dent School Frosh

Dental School freshmen will henceforth be required to
take a one semester course in ﬁrst aid. The course will con-'
sist of three hours study each week, and will carry students
through the preliminary, advanced, and teaching stages.

The program will qualify each: ’

student as a teacher of ﬁrst aid
after he has graduated from the
Dental school and has taken a brief
review course in his senior _year.

Dr. Lawrence E. Van Kirk, dean
of the School, pointed. out that not
only will the program help pro-
vide teachers for the Pitt civil de-
tense program,

with the training that he, often
needs. Dr. Van Kirk explained
that dentists in a community are
usually I called upon’ when ﬁres,
ﬂoods, or accidents occur.

The. course is taught by an au-

thorized Red Cross instructor and

96 dent. students are enrolled in
it now.

Popular Books

, “Now before semester work be-
comes too pressing is a good ‘time
to get some reading done for the

pleasure of it,” says Mrs. Helen.

Dice, librarian « in the Alldred
Room on the sixth floor.

The attractive, comfortably fur-
nished room contains many pop-
ular books written by British and
American novelists. The books are

arranged on open shelves so the

reader’ can browse through them
until he ﬁnds one he likes.

Each month Mrs. Dice purchases
the best of the newly published
books, such as the “New Yorker

cartoons and J. D. Salinger’s
“Catcher in the Rye.”

A Basic Unity ”

One of the many

barriers which has divid-

I ed man from man through the ages has, para-
doxically, been the Worship of God. The con-

ﬁict has rarely come from doubts of His ex-_

istence or His power or His love.
Instead we have alienated each other by

petty disputes abou
tor, about which tri

t the nature of the Crea-
be He favors, about what

words will insure His pleasure or incur His

wrath, about how He regards our petty vir-.

tues and miserable

vi.ces and over just how

He will treat each of us when we leave this

earth.

We have so stressed the differences in our
formal religions that we have overlooked

the many ways in

which we are spiritually

.-alike. We have ignored the large areas in
which there is universal agreement and de-

voted our energies
the gaps.
Religion-in-Life

and talents to widening

Week, currently in. its

fourth day, offers the student the‘ possibility

of determining the

validity of these differ-

ences. You have the opportunity to hear rep-

resentatives of fait

hs other than your own

discuss their philosophies.
We don’t advocate that you come away
from a talk by a clergyman of another faith

with the conviction
his right, but _we do

that yours is wrong «and
urge that you come away

with the feeling that the differences you

- once Timagined are
they are not great

not so great. And that
enough to make him an

enemy ofyou and what you believe.
The differences are, after all, of the man-

ner and not the m

‘Women, Women . . .  

There’s no doubt, about it, girl cheerlead-

ers will do the old

school a lot of good out

on the gridiron. History vaguely implies
that a man ﬁghts better when he has a good

woman behind him
woman in front of

or the prospect of a good
him. How then will our

eleven ‘stalwarts battle when they can see
three or four healthy coeds with a lot of vim
and zing xdoing cartwheels on the sidelines?

But to those unreconstructed adherents to

the male superiorit

y theory, the impending

Jencroachment of women on the sidelines

"comes as just one

more reverse in a long

series, which began with the passage of

woman sufferage.

The defeat is ‘especially

bitter in that it was engineered mainly .by
,males who gaily tossed aside their paramount

role in school spirit in their zeal fora good"

cause.

It would be interesting to hear what an
anthropologist or a Fruedian psychologist has
to say about the agitation for girl cheerlead-

ers.

Is it another sign of “momism?”

connection does the

Carnegie Tech’s recent decision to boost tuition
provides the latest local example of higher educa-
tion’s most pressing problem—-the need for more
money. '

, Last week a commission sponsored by the As-
sociation of American Universities declared that
colleges, need $200,000,000 over the $1,500,000,000
now being spent. Without this
help, higher education will in-
evitably suffer, the group as-
serted; ‘

The needed funds can come
from three sources: students,
business, or the government. All
three present difﬁculties.

God and Man at Yale

ED JENSEN

If Cotton Mather were alive
today, he would look kindly upon
one of his spiritual descendants,
William F. Buckley, Jr., who is
currently carrying on the good
ﬁght. for salvation through intol-
erance and ignorance with all the
zeal old Mather. ‘ " '
reserved for the
w i t c h h u n ,t Z

Mather lived:

     
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 

knowledge that;
he was in the?
midst of a ver'
table Sodom
and that the
Day of Judge- -

ment was imminent.

Buckley, almost four hundred
years later, is going through life
with the same conviction. In his
book, God and Man at Yale, he
relates a ﬁrst hand account -of
four’ years spent in a latter—day
Sodom, Yale. , Like Mather,
Buckley is convinced that the
Day of Judgement is, nigh and
he cal- tell you exactly what it
will be like. Buckley sees the
righteously indignant Yale alum-
ni descending on the campus and
casting the irreligious and col-
lectivists into the ﬁery pit.

The basis for God and Man at
Yale lies in the author’s argu-
ment that Yale is irreligious and
collectivist. His argument is
based on his experiences with
undergraduate professors in re-

ligion and economics, fortiﬁed by '

excerpts from textbooks.

No God There

Buckley maintains that Yale
should be a bulwark of religion
and laissez faire capitalism. He
justiﬁes this on the grounds that
Yale has been, traditionally, a
pillar of God and individualism
and that this is what the alumni
want.

Buckley’s attack on his alma
mater and on American educa-
tion might have carried more
weight had it not been so dog-
matic and sounded so much like
the contrived logistics of a de-
bater who seeks admiration for
his method rather than for his
position. He does well as long as
he is arguing with himself but
his words suffer when they are
exposed to examination.

In one section of his tract, he
argues that guilt—or education-
by association is valid and in an-
other he denies its eﬂ‘icacy. He
claims that the student exposed
to a collectivist prof will invari-
ably become a collectivist, but
the one who spends a semester
with a religious prof will not
become religious.

 

b antia.

his theory that Yale is collectiv-
ist but ,other people have used
the same books and dug out ex-
cerpts showing them to be al-
most facistic_.

His theory on the role of edu-

cation is violently opposed to
that of almost every educator in
the country. He claims that edu-
cation should indoctrinate. He
carriesithis to preposterous ex-
tremes by expressing disapproval
of even those professors who are
neutral. - -

One of his observations is per-
tinent. »“Mr. Gabriel lectures so
dispassionately as to make highly

.reckless, on the basis of :the

~ course, any guess about his per-

sonal ‘convictions on current is-
sues}?

To Bugkley this is-bad. Every-
one must be grinding an axe in
favor of some ism. If he is not,
then, he is suspect. I

A Suspicious Man a

An interesting insight into
Buckley’s mind is provided when
he discusses the fate of examina-
tion papers which he was unable
to obtain. He wanted the papers
for his book but the profs de-
nied him the right to look at
-them. Buckley implies that these
tests would have cast an inter-
esting light on the state of capi-
talism at Yale.

But he does not tell you what
they would have proved. His
comment is “I shall keep to my-
self my guess as to its motives
(i.e. the reasons why he was
refused).” Have you ever tried
getting an exam paperfrom a
prof, especially one which he
planned to use again?

His argument gets even more
-muddled when he comes out
strong for laissez faire capitalism
and then viciously turns upon
laissez faire education. He ar-
gues that freedom of action in
the economic world brought us
untold wealth but that the same
freedom in the mental World will
only ruin us. Academic freedom
he dismisses with a shrug. It is
a sophism and only relative. The
same men who deify academic
freedom also ignore it when it
is expedient, he points out.

The one saving grace of God
and Man at Yale is that it indi-
cates a mind that is actively
concerned with the forces of the
day. The book itself is marred
by error.compounded on error,
by an air of unsufferable prigery,
and by’ its patently untolerant
approach. Buckley reads like the
recorded whisperings of an old
maid who scurries by the local
taproom~‘ with _her eyes shut. If
all alumni had" felt as he does
American education would be ex-

actly whére Iit was in the 17th

are similarly intellectually strait-jacketed. College-

Politics Enters Question.

At Pitt, the question of studen

has centered around how such action would affect

state monetary aid, and not on whether the poli-I V A

cal experience would be valuable for students.
Government money and control, then, are ‘sel-
dom inseparable. ,
Indeed, the immediate future of higher educa-
tion is a gloomy one, I as long as the powers that
control the purse—strings rail against presentation
of views they disagree with. I

The educators can only hope to survive the ‘

  Pitythe Romans

TIM I Kolvmi

PITT-y-the RCMANSI hell! Pity the. students.
They’re' the ones iwhoineed it- ‘They’re the ones

who will have to bea1“th’e brunt of the load.’ When:

Spring Festival and its Roman theme rolls around,

there’s going to be a terriﬁc demand: for shee"ts,{‘_

towels, pillowcases, gunny sacks, ’_tablecloths,_. fra-

ternity initiation robes, and‘ any other object which j

might conceivably be converted into a toga-.

Therein lies the reason for this column... We.’

must be educated. ,We must be Romanized. _.In
short, we must learn how to design, construct, and

‘operate the basic Roman garment.

Authentic Roman togas require soft pliable ma-
terial with moderate nap that will fall into natural
folds and stay there. This seems to rule out sheets.
However, a substitute is available. A cheap, soft,

loosely woven muslin will do. Since 12 to 15 yards.

of the clothare needed, don’t take the word “cheap”

lightly.

The usual color or the Roman toga was ‘white,
but on occasions a purple border was added. For
affairs of state, the entire toga was dyed to a shade
between purple and scarlet.

The length of the toga is lousy. In measuring
for length, the toga should reach from the neck to
the tops of the shoes. It deﬁnitely wasn’t designed
for showing otfthe curves and limbs of a shapely,

female.

In fact the only thing it does is make
shapely girls ordinary girls and ordinary girls more .

ordinary. A toga won’t do much either way for

men.

Draping the toga stylishly is perhaps the most
cunning feature in being the satorically elegant Ro-
man. In this matter, the Hawaiian ﬁsherman’s cast
is not recommended. Wrapping the cloth about the
torso can be learned in any ﬁrst—aid course, but
draping a toga is a science.

The proper technique is described in detail by
Lillian M. Wilson, Ph.D., in her book “The Roman
Toga.” It can be obtained at Carnegie Library as
soon as I’m ﬁnished with it. - 

Brieﬂy, the proceedure is this: Extend the left

" arm as though shaking hands. Drape the cloth over
the left arm and shoulder, starting in front at the
feet and winding up with the other end hanging
down the back. v -

Bring this end across the back and under.the
right arm. Now the cloth should drape or droop

loosely from the right armpit to the rightgknee. ‘

The end should be brought up and over. the left

shoulder.

By DON SCHURMAN .

Because two Pittsburgh-bred athletes approve of the old
adage that there’s no place like home, Football Cgach “Red”
Dawson may have the answer to his quarterback problem.

Dawson’s potential problem—solvers are Henry Ford from
Schenley High School and Pete Neft from Peabody, who
between them, turned away offers from more than 40 other
schools before enrolling at Pitt.

An incoming freshman,
reasons, “I wanted to play in my
own home-town.” To this senti-
ment, Ford adds, ‘‘I’d even like to
go on to play for the Steelers.”

Ford Has Year’s Experience

Such home-town spirit is warm-
ly welcomed by Dawson, especial‘-
ly with the current need for quar-
terbacks caused by the graduation
of Bob Bestwick-.

Both Ford and Neft have the
qualiﬁcations to answer Dawson’s
needs, however, as shown by their
selections to the A1l;City team

‘while in high school. Being an ad-

vanced freshman, Ford also has
one year of collegiate experience.
‘ He came right out of high school
last year to perform as safety-man
under Tom Hamilton. “Except that
college football is rougher and
more scientiﬁc, _it’s not much dif-
ferent from high school,” Model-T
modestly . explains.
Missed by Three

Ford’s analysis stands up against
the ﬁgures, too. In his safety role,
he missed a Pitt punt return rec-
ordb-y only three yards, and while
at Schenley achieved somewhat a
similar feat.

“Once against Allderdice,” Hen-

Nefté

ry recalls, “I received four punts
and ran them all back for touch-
downs.”

Although not quite so sensa-
tional in the punt return depart-
ment, Neft, too, is somewhat of a
defensive expert--besides being a
superb passer and punter.

Played Against Each Other

“We (Peabody) went into our
last of eight games with only 13
points scored against us,” Pete re-
calls. ‘‘I played mostly on of-
fense except near the end of the
games. Then, if the other team got
desperate, I went in on pass de-
fense.”

Dawson Glad Neft, Ford Like Home

.A
‘V

In the only time Ford and Neft
ever met in high school, Pete‘ in-
tercepted one of Model-T’s passes
although Schenley still won, 21-0.

Four-Leter Winner
Neft, 6-1 and 170 pounds, was

a four-letterman while at Peabody,
performing in basketball, baseball,
track and football. He once sprint-
ed the 100-yard dash in 10.1 sec-
onds. “But I expect to play only
football at Pitt,” he makes clear.

Only 17 years old, Neft studies
for his pre-law course when he’s
not away on one of his weekend
ﬁshing trips. Ford, 19, 5-10 and
176 pounds, is in physical educa-
tion with hopes of coaching some
day.»

As for the immediate future,
however, the signal—calling duo
are now thinking of spring train-
_ing--and their pending battle for

the quarterback post.

Swimmers Win Tenth; )

Lose-a Third

to Spartans

By RUSS FRANKE-

After surging through a ﬁne 10-3-1 regular season, the
Pitt tankers are eyeing the Eastern Collegiates this week-
end as a chance to crack some more records.

The individual swimmers who combined to give Pitt

‘one of its best tank seasons will

compete in the annual event for

individual honors which is to be
held at Lehigh this year.

Proﬁtable Weekend

Coach Ben Grady‘ expects his
boys to be in top condition after
last Friday and Saturday’s action
at Detroit andlEast Lansing where
the ﬁns copped two wins from
three opponents. The Panthers
downed Wayne University, 56‘/2-
271/2, and swamped Cincinnati,
71-12, before Michigan State over-
whelmed them, 70-23.

Thus the Gradymen ﬁnished out
the biggest swim card in Pitt his-
tory, losing only to three of the
eastern power teams-—-Ohio State,
Army, and Michigan State—while
gaining a tie with Navy. Numer-
ous records were broken in the
process, both pool and Pitt rec-
ords, along with the improvement
of last season’s 6-2 mark. "

The senior performers on the

squad, free stylers Jim Zentgraf
and Jules ..Melograne, and breast-
stroker Bob Gover, are now get-
ting ready to do their last bit for
their alma mater in the upcoming
championships.

Divers Leave Early

Since the YMHA pool» is slower
than the ones in the East, this
week's‘ workouts are being held
at Taylor-Allderdice where the
water is faster. Coach Grady will
take his divers, Tom Blosser and
Jim Palmer, to New York early to
get them accustomed to high board
dicing, for which there are no fa-
cilities in this area.

Following the ECSA meet‘ at

Lehigh, the Blue-and-Gold will
compete in the National Collegi-
ates and the National AAU Cham-
pionships later this month.

That blankety-blank Carlson. Why did he save all the
action for the last game-—-and an away‘ affair at that? Why
couldn’t he have done the same thing in the two earlier meet-

ings with the Nittanies.

No, he has to send his team to certain defeat at home
and then try for victory away from home in the last
game of the season when Pitt students aren’t‘interested

in whether Pitt wins, loses, A or ¢

ties for that matter.

For the most part Pitt’s home
g a In es h a v e ‘

interesting and
thetwo ‘home "
affairs with ~
State fall into ‘
this category.
So Carlson, a 
Pitt alumnus, :
gives the State

fans the break
of seeing an_‘in—

in the Pitt-State
series.
Like Concrete To Crack

It was obvious that Carlson had
something up his sleeve to break

. State’s roadblock under the bas-

ket. But I never thought he would
give‘ Statefans the opportunity of
seeing Pitt whip the Lions.

' Carlson has been criticized for
Saturday’s game and, although
I am far frompagreeing with his
system, I think that what he did
was the only thing to do.

Pitt didn’t have a ghost of a

chance to win A in a regularly
played game and after the Nit-

tanies bagged 84 points against

West Virginia a few nights before,
they could have practically named
their score against Pitt.
Fight Fire with Fire

State held 6-9' Mark Workman
to three points. It's easy to as-
‘sume that the Lions were using
the same roadblock against the
Mountaineers as they were expect-

~ ing to apply against Pitt.

And Pitt doesn’t have any-
thing to match West Virginia’s
team personnel, so the only way
that Pitt could win was to force
the Lions with their big boys,
Jesse Arnelle, Herm Sledzik,
Jay McMahon, and John Sher-
ry, to come out of their huddle
around the baskets. They re-
fused and Carlson, ﬁguring he

"tilt,
. probably has the best zone defense
_ in, the country.”

 

could be as stubborn as Lion .
coach Elmer Gross, refused to
get trapped like a bachelor at a
Leap Year. party.

Following the last Pitt-State
Carlson said, “Penn State

And it’s no se-
cret that he hates zone defenses.
So he irritated Gross’ zone defense
by attempting to break it in an
unorthodox manner.

Roadblock or Freeze

Gross calls Pitt’s play disgust-
ing and adds that maybe if Pitt
had tried they could have won.

Well, Mr. Gross, you had the
power to change the complexion
of the game by giving Pitt a
«chance at the baskets by coming
out of that zone. You’re just as
much at fault as the man you’re
criticizing. And for your infor-
mation, Pitt couldn’t have beaten
your ball club this year unless
they employed stilts.

It’s the case where Gross saw he *

was beat so he planned on allow-
ing Carlson to absorb the criticism
by playing along with "him. If a
man has the ball in his possession
and no one goes after him, he’s
foolish to shoot when he knows
that there will be at least eight

._ opponent’s hands reaching up for

the rebound.

Carlson was out to win the game

and if he had had that 9-6 lead
midway in the fourth quarter in-
stead of State, then the. Panthers
would have come home victorious
andthe joke would have been on
Gross. ,
' There’ll come a day when Doc
may succeed against State’s zone.
But first he’ll have togget big men
—or win by freezing.

And from watching several
coaches this year I’d take Carl-
son’s method over that twin-‘em
by hook or crook’ method em-
ployed at several schools in the
Tri—State.

Tuition Raised

SCHAEFFER PEN—R.S.R. Call ~HAzel

$40 Next Fall

Pitt’s neighbors across the park
at Carnegie Institute of Technol-
ogy will have $40 added to their
tuition’ beginning next fall. “The
additional income is necessary to
maintain the quality of our edu-
cation,” said Carnegie President
J. C. Warner.‘

The increase will effectall de-
partments, but the tuition will still
be lower than that of other univer-
sities of similar standing.

The raise in tuition is caused by
Carnegie Tech’s anticipated loss of
$285,000 this year. President War-
ner admitted that the cost of ‘a

student’s education is not covered
by his tuition fee. Tuition fees
cover only 45 per cent of this cost
and each year the cost of teaching
services and materials mounts.

The raise in tuition,wil1 help
ease this deﬁcit which previously
had been met from gifts and

 

grants.

Religious Groups on Campus

(Religion-in-Life

By LOIS HOLLERAN
Week (Mar. 2-8) emphasizes the place of

God in a college student’s life every year, but various campus
religious clubs have year-round programs designed to do the
same thing. The following sketches are designed to acquaint stu-
dents with current club calendars.)

By LOIS HOLLERAN

Newman Club

Tonight the Newman Club is
having a free dinner at the club
house, 150 N. Craig St., at 6:30
p.m. The menu includes: toasted
cheese sandwiches, tomato juice,
potato salad, pretzels, and coffee
or milk. Anyone interested is in-
vited to join the Newmanites.

Sunday they will close the week
of religious emphasis with a Fed-
eration-sponsored c om m u n i o n
breakfast in Central Catholic High
after 10 ,a.m. Mass at St. Paul’s
Cathedral. Tickets are being sold
at the student desk for 65 cents.
Rev. J ohn.M. Frawley will be the
guest speaker.

The Newman Club tries to pre-
sent Catholic students with a well
balanced program of religious,
cultural, social, and athletic events.

Monthly communion breakfasts,
weekly religion classes, and .the
annual Mary’s Day, keep New-
mans aware of God.

The group meets the ﬁrst Wed-
nesday of the month at the club
house for a business meeting and
Social. '

/.

It has monthly mixer dances, an
annual formal dance, two summer
picnics at the county parks, and
football and basketball teams.

3 Membership dues ‘of $2.50 per
year or $1.50 a semester are pay-
able at the student desk.

Canterbury Club

The Canterbury Club is the
Episcopalian student organization
on campus. I

Twice monthly, the ﬁrst and
third Tuesdays, the club members
have dinner at 6 p.m. in the
Church of the Ascension, corner of
Ellsworth and Neville. After din-
ner they have a business meeting
and either instruction or recrea-
tion.

The instruction is usually given
by a local church leader. Recre-
ation takes the form of swimming
parties at the “Y” or games in the
church recreation rooms.

Last week the group joined with
the women of ithe Church to put
on a Mardi Gras. There were
booths, games, dances, and prizes,
in the last gala affair before Lent.

ter the club holds week-end re-
treats with the Tech Chapter. It
