A Judicial
committee
to hear
complaint

Mahita Gaj anan
Szfaﬁ” I/Vrizfer

For the ﬁrst time since the early
2000s, the Student Government

Board’s Judicial Committee will ‘

officially hear a case.

According to Chairman Joe
Kozak, the committee will hold a
closed hearing at an undisclosed
location this evening to address
an infraction complaint against
Board President Gordon Loud-
erback that SGB Elections Com-
mittee Chairman Aaron Gish ﬁled
on Sunday. ' A H

“The disagreement centers on
comments Louderback made to
Gish last week indicating that he
felt earlier remarks made by Gish
displayed a level of bias on the
part of the Elections Committee
chair. Gish then ﬁled the infrac-
tion alleging that Louderback’s

'_ comments constituted interfer-
ence with the Elections Commit-

tee’s autonomy and ‘an attempt
by the Board president to exert
undue inﬂuence over it. p '

“We will hear both sides of the

I incident at hand and will identify

if codes have been broken based
on the actions of individuals,”
Kozak said. ~ -

The accusations

According to the ﬁled infrac-
tion, the remarks Louderback
took issue with were made by Gish
to Board member Amelia Brause,
who serves as the Board liaison
to the Elections Committee, and

Three of Pittsburgh’s four Demo-
cratic mayoral candidates com—.
municated their ideas at a debate
on Pitt’s campus Wednesday night
about how to ﬁx problems ailing
the city in the midst.of one of the
race’s most tumultuous periods.
Just days after City Control-
ler Michael Lamb exited the race,
about 200 attendees in the O’Hara
Student Center Ballroom watched
as City Councilman Bill'Peduto,
former State Auditor General
Jack Wagner and State" Rep. Jake
Wheatley, D—A1legheny, ‘ debated
a series of topics ranging from
nonproﬁt taxation to the extent of
A Pittsburgh’s transit system.

Pitt News Editor-in-Chief Amy
Friedenberger moderated the
debate, whichwas sponsored by
92.1 WPTS-FM, Pitt’s student—run
radio station, student—run publi-

cation Pitt Political Review and

the Pitt Graduate and Professional
Student Government.

The Democratic primary race’s
fourth candidate, bus monitor A._].
Richardson, made a brief state—‘
ment before the debate after being
arrested for a DUI charge earlier
in the morning. He expressed re-
gret over his decision to drink and
drive and apologized to those in
the audience, generating a loud
applause. V A

“I want to ap.ologize to each‘
and every one of you and also to

' the City of Pittsburgh for my ac-

tions. I shouldn’t have been drink-

said, calling his actions “sense—

less” and “reckless.” A
Richardson, before leaving the

‘debate early to handle matters

stemming from the incident, also
revealed that he plans to plead
guilty to his DUI charge.

The debate proved cordial,

with the three candidates agree-
ing that changes need to take
place in relation to police over-
sight, nonproﬁt taxation, trans-

, portation and other issues, but

differing in their approaches to
bringing about that change.

The greatest source of conten-
tion in the debate proved to be
the issue of campaign ﬁnancing.
Earlier on Wednesday, a local
court struck down a 2009 city
ordinance that limited campaign

ﬁnancing for the ‘Democratic pri- ‘

mary. The ordinance would have
prevented Wagner from using
campaign funds gathered during
runs for previous political posi-
tions in the curre'nt.élection.

, Peduto had brought the claim
to court that, given the exis-
tence, of the ordinance, Wagner

-shouldn’t be allowed to use part

of the funds he had collected. The
court struck down the ordinance,
therebyallowing Wagner to use
the funds in question.

“This is what makes people
turn off from politics,” Wheatley
said of the campaign ﬁnance bick-
ering before advocating reform.

Both Wagner and Peduto
agreed that campaign ﬁnance
reform was essential to fair gov-
ernance, but both also madeclear

Colbert
announces
date to
speak at p
  Pitt“  

Seniors worried about not see-
ing Stephen Colbert before grad-
uation can breathe easy.

He’s ﬁnally coming.

The University and the Swan-
son School of Engineering, with
the-Pitt Program Council’s coop-
eration, will host the comedian
and host of Comedy Central’s
“The Colbert Report” at Carn-
egie Music Hall on Friday, April
19, at 1:30 p.m. Doors will open
an hour prior to the event.

Tickets for the event first be-
came available in January and
were entirely scooped up within
hours of their initial release. In
order to use their previously at-
tained tickets for entrance to
the event, "ticket holders must"
exchange their old" tickets for
new ones by 5 p.m. on Wednes-
day, April 17. ,

Unexchanged tickets will be
deemed void and will not permit
admittance to the event. After
April 17, unclaimed _new tickets
will be redistributed.

Students can exchange tick-
ets at the location they received
them —— Benedum Hall or the
William Pitt Union —- beginning

will exchange their tickets for
the same seats they originally

Colbert’s visit to campus
comes almost a full year after
four Pitt engineering students
successfully completed his Su-
per PAC treasure hunt in June
2012, winning Colbert’s visit to

T the University as their grand

prize.

Colbert originally planned to
visit Pitt onjan. 18, but he post-

that, per the court’s ruling, they
would work under the rules of un-
limited campaign ﬁnancing for
the remainder of the campaign.
They hinted that no agreement
between the candidates to restrict
campaign funding was expected.

Wagner, Peduto and Wheatley
all support Mayor Luke Ravens-
tahl’s recent efforts to challenge
UPMC’s tax—exempt nonproﬁt sta-
tus. All three said they would ex-

pand this effort to examine other -

nonproﬁts, as well. But Wagner
said Pitt would be safe from taxa-
tion. »

“I consider UPMC to bea prof-
itable nonproﬁt. I do not consider
Pitt to be a proﬁtable nonproﬁt,”
he said.

A large portion of the de-
bate concentrated on how the
candidates would govern in the

C aftermath of the recent scandal

involving the Pittsburgh Police
Department and the Mayor’s Of-
ﬁce. 4 a
Federal investigators launched
an inquiry in March into a mis-
appropriation of funds by Pitts-
“burgh police. The investigators
discovered that police, under the
direction of Chief Nate Harper,
had placed funds earned by the
department through private con-
tracting jobs intoaccounts not
sanctioned‘ by the city. It was
also revealed during the investi-
' gation that bodyguards working
for Mayor Luke Ravenstahl could

withdraw money through the use '

of a credit card attached to the
unsanctioned accounts. V ‘

“I think we need to re-instill
trust in government again,”
Wheatley said.

As a move in this direction,
Wheatley, a former active-duty
Marine, proposed an end to the
use of government money to pay
forbodyguards, which Ravenstahl
sometimes utilizes on trips. He

. promised, if elected, to pay for his
purchases as mayor himself and
get reimbursement later.

Wagner, too, said that he would
put an end to taxpayer money go-
ing toward bodyguards for the
mayor and that “no credit card
will be given to anyone.”

Peduto said that he would not
use a credit card given to him by
city government, advocating for
more transparency in government
spending. '- ,

“I’ll take a pair of scissors and
cut that card up,” Peduto said.

Peduto and Wagner disagreed
on where the hiring process for
a new city police chief should
aim its efforts. Wagner believed
that the search should look “ﬁrst
and foremost from within,” while
Peduto proposed. a nationwide
search from theloutset.

“I want to be able to look all
over the country for wholwill be
the best police chief,” Peduto said.

All three candidates agreed
that there must be a change in the

4

police department to prevent de—'

partment politics from dictating
who gets off—duty security jobs. In
additipn to their work for the city,
police officers are also often hired
to work by private businesses as
a way to supplement the officers’
incomes. The candidates noted
that an unfair system is used to
determine which oﬂicers receive
this work.

“Priority is given to certain of-
ﬁcers for certain duties,” Wagner
said, calling the system “an orga-
nizational problem.” by

Peduto said that several years
ago, he proposed a computer
system to make the operation of
assigning officers to private jobs
transparent, but that his proposal
was voted down in city council by
a vote of 8 to 1. He said measures
to improve transparency of the
municipal government are nec-
essary in orderjto.moderniz_e it.

“That’s the best disinfectant to
corruption —— sunshine,” he said.

JUDICIAL

were “concerned with the composition of
the Board and the Fifth and Forbes slates
with regard to the organization known as
the Druids,” a secret organization of Pitt
students who carry out anonymous actions
across campus. .

Louderback ran for his position on SGB
on the Forbes slate with Brause and C._].
Bonge, and Thomas ]abro,]ohn Cordier and
Sarah Winston ran on the Fifth slate during
last November’s campaign season. All six
were elected to the current ni‘ne—member
Board — responsible for allocating the
more than $2.3 million Student Activities
Fund.

As the basis for his complaint, Gish
cited the SGB Constitution and Code of
Ethics. According to Article 1, Section V, of
the constitution, “the Board shall be non-
voting members of all Student Government
Board ad hoc committees and task forces.
The Board may under no circumstances
sit in on the hearings and deliberations of
the Allocations, Elections and/or Judicial
Committees, or otherwise attempt to exert
any undue inﬂuence on the business of the
aforementioned standing committees.”

The disagreement between Gish and
Louderback arose in the midst of a week of
discussion over proposed revisions to the

. SGB Elections Code, which Gish presented
to the Board in early March. As The Pitt

News reported on Monday, the majority of
the Board members stand in opposition to
Gish’s proposed revisions in their current
form, with the main point of contention
being Gish’s proposal to eliminate SGB can-
didates’ ability to form megaslates —— or
allied groups of more than one campaign
slate — during the election season. In his
complaint to thejudicial Committee, Gish

- ‘calls for a “full assessment” of whether

Gish held the authority to make the state-
ments he did, or if doing so reflected a bias
on his part. . ~
Kozak, who is responsible for deciding
if ﬁled infractions will go to hearing, de-
cided to see Gish’s case because he felt the
Elections Committee chairman’s statement
brought up multiple issues and violations
that called for adjudicatio_n through an of-
ﬁcial hearing. He declined to comment on
what the issues and violations might be.
Structuring a hearing ‘ -
_ According to thejudicial Committee by-
laws, tonight’s hearing will be held in front

, of a jury composed of Judicial Committee

members. Gish, the complainant, will make
an opening statement, and Louderback, the
defendant, will follow Gish with a statement

of hisown. Both Gish and Louderback are ‘

allowed to have witnesses come forward to
offer supportive testimony, and Kozak said
he was certain there would.be witnesses.
The hearing will be closed, but the Com-
mittee will make a recording that can be
made public upon request within 30 days

of the hearing.
Kozak and the jury will question Gish,

Louderback and any witnesses, and then‘

Gish and Louderback will have the option
to make closing statements. Kozak and
the jury will then recess for closed delib-
‘ erations and voting, which will not be re-
corded. Kozak is responsible for a narrative

, of the facts for a public statement.

According to Kozak, the committee’s

bylaws did not clearly state how thejudicial ‘

Committee would decide on a verdict for
. a hearing until this year. The 2013 version
of the bylaws states that the verdict will be
decided by: “a simple majority of the total
judicial Committee members present at the
hearing” and “a preponderance of evidence
presented during the hearing.”
Louderback said Sunday that, before

Gish’s ﬁling, he had expected the matter‘

to be dealt with before a tribunal — an
official discussion — instead of a judicial
hearing, and Gish noted in his complaint
that he would be content with addressing
the matter through a tribunal.- While Kozak
said he determined a hearing was necessary
as part of the judicial process for this case,
he said he_,would also call a tribunal after
the hearing to discuss the autonomy of the
Elections Committee chair in a more open
setting. Though the rules for a tribunal are
not currently in the bylaws, K_ozak said he
imagined the Judicial Committee would
gather to hear statements from various
individuals or parties involved in the case.

Unlike a hearing, the tribunal will be open
to the public, and Gish, Louderback and
Board members can talk about the auton-
omy of the Elections Chair.

Kozak said that because the disagree-
ment between Gish and Louderback seemed
to be calling into question the role of the
Elections Chair, he wanted to give SGB
members the opportunity to talk about
their interpretation of the chair’s auton-
omy.

A more active committee

The hearing will be a change for the role
of the Judicial Committee chair, who most
often plays the role of timekeeper at the
weekly public SGB meetings. Although the
rules for hearings are clearly established,

it’s been years since thejudicial Committee -

chair has had to oversee a case.

As chairperson of thejudicial Commit-
tee, Kozak is responsible for‘ heading his
committee of nine members, revising the
bylaws of the other committees within the
student government and overseeing cases.

Kozak said he is unsure why people
hadn’t ﬁled complaints or infractions in
the past with the intention of _going to a
hearing to solve problems. i _ -

“We have this system in place for a rea-
son, and, based upon the idea of transpar-
ency, I think it is a positive step forward,”
Kozak said. i

Kozak said it could be possible that peo-

' plehesitate to initiate a hearing because it

could draw negative attention, whereas a
push from the judicial chair to solve any
disagreements draws less focus.

“It’s just like a slap on the wrist,” he said.

To make the Judicial Committee more
active this year, Board President Gordon
Louderback decided to utilize the commit-
tee members to help solidify and centralize
bylaws. Though the committee is respon-
sible for hearing cases if a member of a
student organization comes forward with
an appeal, it is rare for a case to come about.

Louderback noted that, in the past,
committee members served to help out in

April 4, 20i 8 | The Pitt News I v\/vwv.pittr_ievvs.com

smaller projects when the Board needed
them. This year, Louderback said, he want-

ed the committee to have an active hand in

shaping S-GB.

The goal this year for the Judicial Com-
mittee is to make all the documentation
within SGB more coherent and transparent,
Kozak said.

One way the members are working to
do this is to make electronic copies of vari-
ous documents to improve readability that
will be put online as PDFs so anyone can
ﬁnd them.

“My main focus is to revise everything so
that it’s up to date and consistent through-
out our University,” Kozak said.

Currently, each member of the Judicial

Committee is assigned to oversee one of the
other SGB committees in revising commit-
tee bylaws. These committees include the

Governmental Relations Committee, Com- '

munityfoutreach Committee and Academic
Affairs Committee.

Kozak said that the judicial'Commit—
tee itself has had to revise its bylaws, and
its current bylaws are with the Board for
ﬁnal revision. The effectiveness of the revi-
sions will be put to the test during Thursday
night’s hearing. ‘

Despite thejudicial Committee’s recent
action, Louderback said it will most likely
continue to have a light workload. ,

“The Judicial Committee doesn’t do
much unless it has to,” he said. I

Beware unpaid internships that are
unrelated to desired ﬁeld of Work

  OPINIONS,

Don’i'he trapped in an unpaid internship that leaves you with no marketable skills. MC_T Campus

Rohith Palli
Columnist .

In 2012, The National Associa-
tion of Colleges and Employers
found that college graduates
with at least one unpaid intern-
ship had a 37 percent chance of
having a job offer at graduation.

The likelihood of having a job
offer if you cl_idn’t have intern-
ship experience was 36 percent.

Those with paid internship
experience, on the other hand,
had a 60 percent chance of hav-

- ing a‘ job offer;
This data strongly suggests A '

that unpaid internships just may
not be worth the effort. Not only
do they force students to do
work without pay and preclude
the students from working other
jobs or focusing on education,
but they simply don’t substan-
tially improve employment pros-
pects at graduation. _

The message here is clear:
Students need to be very__cau—
tious about taking unpaid in-
ternships. - f V _

The difference between paid
and unpaid is often the nature of
the work. The NACE study found
42 percent of paid interns’ time
was spent _on “professional ac-
tivities,” which theoretically are"
what provide the educational
component of an internship. In

contrast, only 30 percent of the
unpaid interns’ time was spent
on these “professional activi-
ties,” while 31 percent was spent
on “clerical and nonessential
work.” '

These kinds of results indi-
cate that employers offer-ing
unpaid internships are often
cheating students out of their
labor. Students are often just do-
ing clerical work that would nor-
mally be performed by real em-
ployees. Why provide students
with paid internships when they
will eagerly perform simple of-
ﬁce tasks for free? .

Laws are supposed to protect
against this type of exploita-
tion. The Department of Labor,

in accordance with judicial in-_

terpretation of the Fair Labor

V‘ Standards Act,. has put forth‘

guidelines for the legality of

unpaid internships in for—p'rof1t.

companies. - A '
They are as follows: _
1. The internship’, even

though it includes actual op- ;

eration of the facilities of the

’ employer, is similar to training '

that would be given in an edu-
cational environment.

2. The internship experience
is for the benefit of the intern.

3. The intern does not dis-
place regular employees, but
worksunder close supervision
of existing staff.

4. The employer that pro-

vides the training derives no.

immediate advantage from the

‘activities of the intern; and on

occasion its operations may ac-
tually beimpeded.

5. The intern is not necessar-
ily entitled to a job at the conclu-
sion of the "internship. A
" 6. The employer and the in-
tern understand that the intern
is not entitled to wages for the
time spent in the internship.

Anybody with experience in

unpaid internships knows these
stipulations rarely hold. Experts
agree, as well: in 2010, The'New
York Times‘ reported that Nancy
"Leppink, then-acting director of
the Labor lDepa'rtment’s Wages
and Hours Division, believed
that it is unlikely for an intern-
-ship at a for-profit company to
comply with these guidelines.
According to Leppink, “There
aren’t going to be many circum-
stances" where you can have an
internship and not be paid and
still be in compliance with the
law.” ' _ ‘ ’
So you may ask, good reader,
what about me‘? What should I
do when everybody is saying I
should do an internship? V
Well, their advice is still true.
Students who do paid intern-

‘ ships, after all, have almost dou-

"The Art of Japanese Noh Drama:
Tsukioka Kogyo, 1869-1927"
Through May 17

Barco Law Library, Monday
through Thursday, times vary
Admission: Free
www.law.pitt.edu/library/art—gallery

For the next‘ few weeks-, a small
splash of Japan’s Meiji era will
dot the walls of the Barco Law
Library, sidelining the View of
David Lawrence Hall’s roof and
drawing eyes away from both the
windows and the books.

What started over a decade
ago asan attempt to give life to
empty space on large white walls
has become a regularly rotat-
ing art exhibit that is currently
bringing the work of master
print designer Tsukioka Kogyo
to the University of Pittsburgh.

The exhibit, a part of the
Barco Law Library’s ongoing
tradition of showcasing local,
national and international art,
features color woodblock prints
Kogyo designed in the late 1800s
and early 1900s. °, ’

Titled “The Art of Japanese
Noh Drama: Tsukioka Kogyo,
1869-1927,” the new exhibit is
made up‘of printsof various
scenes of Noh drama, a type of
stylized Japanese musical the-
ater that often-incorporates
recitation, son.g, dance and
mime. The prints make up a five-

— volume set called “Noga.taikan.”

The Meiji era, which extend-
ed from 1868 to 1912, marked
Japanese society moving from
fe_udalism to its modern form,
although this modernization

went hand in hand with a rise

1. of nostalgia for the country’s

traditional values. .
The prints displayed are from
a collection belonging to Rich-
ard Smethurst of Pit't’s history
department and Mae Smethurst
of the classics department.
The Smethursts first went
to Japan in 1957‘after they were
married. Their interest in Noh
drama was sparked while there,
and they have been enthusiasts
ever since. V
“Collecting isn’t theright
word,” Richard Smethurst said.
“It makes it sound like you’re in

it for a business. We didn’t col-'

lect them to keep them in stor-

age. We actually like to hang

them up.”

Thehistory professor lik-
ened the 'process of creating a
woodblock print to fitting to-
gether the pieces of a puzzle.
Each part of the ﬁnal picture
must be carved around before
ink is applied and then pressed
to the paper. The ‘careful pro-
cedure must be‘ done one block
at a time.

a he said, noting that was the only

way to describe them. V
Each print depicts a differ-
ent scene from Noh drama but
with the artist’s added touch of
inflection. Many prints show a
duality in which half of the paper
is dedicated to the scene as it is
performed while the other half
allows the viewer to see how Ko-
gyo interpreted the story. This
allows for a peek intoﬂthe artist’s

ruminations on topics including‘
gods, spirits, women, warriors ’

and demons.

“He is not reproducing the
performance in any of these,”
Mae Smethurst said. “He is de-
picting what the performance
said to him.”

Kogyo’s “Nogaku zue” series
has already been digitized and
uploaded to the web through
the University Library System.
The University recently pur-
chased the “Kyogen gojuban”
set, and plans to digitize it and
the Smethursts’ “Noga taikan”
collection. .

‘Bioshock’ sequel continues aestheticbrilliance of predecessors

Thomas Visco
Staff Writer

“Bioshock Infinite“
Producer: irrational Games and Ken Levine
Grade: A

Foreshadowing is a literary device used by au-
thors to reveal plot points of a narrative before

they occur. The ﬁrstfew lines of “BioShock Inﬁ-

nite” are an example of foreshadowing.
“Excuse me, where am I?” the player—con~

‘trolled protagonist asks after ﬁnding himself

knee deep in water in a chapel in the sky. “Heav—
en, friend, or as close as we’ll see till judgment
day,” responds a white-robed man standing
nearby.

I’ve never been to video game heaven, but,
nameless and essentially faceless, this robed
ﬁgure foreshadows the true greatness of “Bio—
Shock Inﬁnite,” the most anticipated game in
recent memory.

This third installment in the “BioShock”
series — the spiritual successor and intellec-
tual heir to the critically acclaimed and highly
inﬂuential “SystemShocl6’ series + is the latest
masterpiece from Irrational Games and game
designer Ken Levine, who’s more artist than
designer atthis point. Setin1912, the game, like
any pure art form, provides a profound social
commentary, in this case, on the founding of the

. United States, its history of fanaticism and the

deep racial tension of the early 20th century. '
The action takes place in the most beautiﬁilly
crafted setting ever conceived in avideo game.

soldier and former detective for the Pinkerton
Agency. who is sent to Columbia to repay an
unknown debt. His mission is to save Elizabeth,
a dimension—bending girl with mysterious pow-
ers and a veiled past.

Comstock founds Columbia as an idealized
America — the mythic America that only ex-
ists in textbooks of the 1950s and" at tea party
rallies. Veiled  the glorious sunshine of this
fanciful sky—city, marble statues of Father Wash-
ington, Fatherjefferson and Father Franklin
are worshipped as demi—gods and greet the
player at nearly every turn. Stunning in aspect

Comstock, colloquially known as “The

that governs Columbia. Cornstock’s twisted vi-
sion for America is unyielding, and the art of Co-

Keeping up with the online music scene is ex-
hausting. Scrolling through feeds on Pitchfork,
Gorilla vs. Bear, Hypebeast, Soundcloud and
other music sites every day is draining, and it
also results in music lovers sometimes forget-
tingthat musicians are people, too. oftentimes,

they’re even weird, interesting people that you’cl i

want to have as friends.

Luckily, Twitter has helped to make things
easier, and musicians are using this social me-
dia platform as another means of releasing
their creative energies. The results are some
fascinating Twitter accounts. Here’s ‘a list of
some of the best, coolest or even just the most

BIOSHOCK

R “BioShock’s” and “System Shock’s” action-RPG

tradition. Players have a variety of weapons and

powers to use, all of which can be upgraded and —

specialized at the player’s behest.

Combat is frenetic, and options abound for
players to adopt many differenttactics. The
wide—open battle spaces stress verticality, cover

. and movement in awell—balanced equation. The

enemies, like the setting, all work together to
presentaharmonic, consistent narrative of Co-
lumbia. Mechanized Washingtons and Lincolns
aid Co_lumbia’s police force, hurling slurs like
hand grenades. 0
Elizabeth, the-player’s partner throughout
the game, ﬁts ﬂawlessly within the narrative.
She accompanies Booker through the majority
ofthe combat, and her presence never feels like a
burden — an impressive featfor any video game.
Elizabeth scavenges the battleﬁeld, ﬁnding am-
munition, weapons and other resources to aid
you in combat. Her writing and voice acting is
also ﬂawless. Elizabeth and Booker’s interactions
become the drivingforce of the narrative, which
does not disappoint. ‘ ' . '_
“BioShock Inﬁnite” has aremarkable amount
to say about identity, narrative, blind national-
ism and myth, and all of it is packaged nicely in
the framework of a video game. It is the most
impressive video gamell have played in some
time, and, like its predecessors, it will live in the
pantheon ofunforgettable artistic experiences. I

terrorism porn. The premise of going to the
movie theater and shelling out.$12 to imagine a
horrendous national emergency in vivid detail
is becoming more and more common, and,
frankly, itis disgusting. -

What makes action thrillers like “Die Hard”
classics is how neatly writers weave social com-
mentary into the script, and how, ‘despite Bruce
Willis’ overall bad-assness, the villain s motiva-

_ tionisneversimply“we hateAmericans because
. we aren’t American.”

“Olympus” fails to view national security

‘ through. the complex scope that it deserves

— a la “Homeland” — but instead spends an
overwroughtz 1/2 hours tryingto convince the
audience that we should be afraid of foreigners.

ART

Pitt one of the most prominent places
in the world to study Kogyo’s work, ac-
cording to Richard Smethurst, who went
on to say that -Kogyo’s fourth and final
set is owned by Scripps College in Cla-
remont, Calif. '

The exhibit _is part.of a celebration
of the Smethursts’ contributions to the
University as they ready for retirement.
Nestled on the walls near the library’s
commons area, the woodblock prints oc-
cupy what used to be blank spaces.

After renovations moved book stacks
to different parts of the -floor, the move

produced an empty space on the walls.
“I ﬁgured, ‘Why don’t we just hang

something up?’” recalls Marc,Silverman,r

the associate director of the library. “It
seems like it was made for it.”
Silverman said the inclusion of art-
work “gives life” to aspace “treasured”
by the law students. He has been the or-
ganizer of the Barco Law Library’s art
exhibits-_since its inception. p

. This exhibit is the first at the library
to feature woodblock prints, according
to Silverman. .

_ “It’s extraordinarily interesting,”_ said
Ruth Drescher, alPittsburgh artist and
collector who has also had her own work
displayed in the Barco Law Library. “It’s a

 

ro ra

l‘l‘l‘C0 l   

great opportunity to seejapanese wood-
cuts ofthis’ qua1ity.” '

. Mae Smethurst echoed Drescher’s ap-
preciation, saying she remains amazed
by the accuracy of the carvings. Some 0;,
the etchings, such as the spores of flow-
ers, require a straining of the eye to fully
appreciate.'At times, the details are even
smaller than newsprint.

She described the work as “kinetically
interesting,” and has written multiple
books on Noh theater. ' 4'

Richard Smethurst cites his favorite
piece as one that depicts an elf that dis-
covers a vase of sake that never empties.

“Doesn’t thatsound great?” he asked
comically. I

The Pitt softball team traveled
to Moon Township on Thursday
afternoon for a nonconference
doubleheader against local rival
Robert Morris.

Bu-t the Panthers (14-17, 3-3
Big East) seemed to have left their
bats back in Oakland, dropping
both contests to the Colonials (16-
9) and scoring just one run in the
process.

It was the ﬁrst time in six years

that Robert Morris swept Pitt in a ‘

doubleheader. .

The Colonials shut out the
Panthers in the opening game of
the doubleheader, picking up the
victory thanks to a three—run third
inning and strong pitching perfor-
mances by starter Geena Badolato

Both teams left two runners
on base in the ﬁrst two innings

Coach Stottlemyer contemplates retirement after successful season

Dustin Gabler
Senior Sifajf Wrz'ter

When Rande Stottlemyer took
the Pitt wrestling head coaching
job in 1979, he had to rebuild one
of the most historic wrestling
programs in the nation. .

Now, 34 years‘ after taking

over the reins and succeeding‘

in recapturing the respectability
of a program that, in its earliest
years, was a consistent top-10
ﬁnisher, Stottlemyer is contem-
plating retirement.

“We had a teamdinner with ’

alumni, fans and parents the
night before the [NCAA cham-
pionship] finals, and he stood

y up and dedicated all our year’s

success to our three assistants,”
senior Zac Thomusseit said. “He
said he is going to take a little
time and figure out his future
with his family.”

Even those closest to the pro-
gram still wonder if Stottlemyer,
54, plans to return for another
season, but some have begun to

accept that the successful coach,
who declined to comment. for
this story, may be moving on
after he recently named associ-
ate head coachjason Peters the
head—coach—in-waiting.

Peters has been on Stottle-
myer’s staff for 11 years and has
served as the top assistant coach
for the last 10.

“The future of the program .

is in good hands with Peters,”
senior Matt Wilps said. ‘
Unlike All-Americans Wilps
and Thomusseit, redshirt junior
P._]. Tasser returns to Pitt next
year. If the Panthers do have a
new head coach, he said, the
hard—working mentality that
Stottlemyer instilled in them
will remain. -
“Our program has been put-
ting in the man—hours the past
few years and things are paying
off,” Tasser said. “There is no
doubt in my mind that next year,

-even with the transition to the

ACC, that our team will be good.”

take over the successful Pitt
wrestling program excites Pe-
ters, whether the transition next
season or a few years from now.

“Any time you have the op-
portunity to be a part ofa pro-
gram that has success, if yoil”
can continue to keep doing what
you’ve been doing, it’s exciting,”
he said. _

Stottlemyer, a three-time All-
American during his wrestling
career at Pitt, which concludeée
in 1978, has coached 22 All-
Americans. And unlike many
older coaches, Stottlemyer has
had some of his best teams re-
cently. The past two have ﬁn-
ished 1sth in the nation.

Steven Adams intends to Sign witlian agent soon. Bobby Mizia | Assistant Visual Editor

~Dustin Gabler ' .
Senior Szfcyff Wrz'ter

In a shocking and confusing decision, Pitt
. freshman center Steven Adams announced
Tuesday night he would be declaring for
the NBA draft. Although national and local
, media questioned Adams’ decision, it came
as no surprise to many Pitt fans. .

They’ve been through this before. Chris
Taft and Dejuan Blair left after two years
at ‘Pitt to become second-round NBA draft
picks.

Taft played one season in the NBA — 17
gamesin 2005 with the Golden State War-
riors — before being released. Blair, despite
dominating during his two years at Pitt, is
in his fourth season with the San Antonio
Spurs but still hasn’t developed into any-
thing more than a role player. This season,
he’s averaging fewer minutes, points and
rebounds than any of his previous three
seasons. ‘ .

This problem isn’t just limited to the
realm of basketball. The football program

has had several successful players leave be-
fore their four years were up at Pitt, but few
have been selected in the ﬁrst round.

The only player to ﬁnd real success af-
ter leaving early is football legend Larry
Fitzgerald, who left after two 1,000—yard
seasons to become the third—overall pick
by the Arizona Cardinals in 2004. LeSean
McCoy is also one of the best players at his
position in the NFL. Despite looking the
part of being a top running back in college,

. McCoy was’ a second-round selection by
-the Philadelphia Eagles after his two years

at Pitt. .
Jonathan Baldwin was also a first—round

selection, the 26th pick in the 2011 draft,_

and in his two seasons with the Kansas City
Chiefs, he has 41 total receptions and two
touchdowns.

McCoy’s successor, Dion Lewis, also left
Pitt after just two years and was selected in
the second round. He appears to be strug-
gling to remain McCoy’s backup in Phila-

most for a freshman Panthers big man since
Blair in 2007-2008.

Despite that workload, Adams averaged
7.2 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. It’s
hard to see why he would get drafted based
on that performance. ' ~

But make no mistake, Adams will get
drafted. A 7-footcenter with raw skill, Ad-
ams boasts a lot of potential, and in the
NBA, potential is what gets many players

‘ drafted.

_ He’s projected to go in the second half
of the ﬁrst round, and thatwill earn him at
least $850,000 —— the salary for the 30th
overall pick.

His decision to leave and provide for '
his family —— Adams has 17 siblings and his ,

father passed away when he was 14 — is
certainly a noble one. . ,
“After talking with Steven and his fam-
ily, we fully support him in this decision,”
Dixon said. “We support him in choosing

to pursue his dreams and in having the op-_

portunity to provide for his family back in
New Zealand.”

Although he will get drafted, it’s hard
topimagine Adams battling against NBA
centers next year with any success. He’ll
likely wind up in the N BA’s Development
League, which doesn’t have a great history
of actually developing players.

“Coachjstottlemyer helped me cope
with the weight of the season and revealed
traits in me that deﬁne who I am,” he said.

Thomusseit, who became Stottlemyer’s
22nd All—American last month, feels hon-

from the Pitt wrestling scene.

“Rande will always be a part of Pitt

go away, whether he’s the Pitt wrestling
coach or not.’ I’m sure he’ll be involved
