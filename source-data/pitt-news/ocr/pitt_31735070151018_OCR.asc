Proposals for Schenley,

I-pligh released to public

Almost ﬁve years removed from its
controversial closing, the Schenley

High School building in Oakland '

might have a new owner soon.

In September 2012, four years
after the historic school closed be-
cause of an asbestos problem, the
Pittsburgh Public School Board voted
ﬁve to four to sell the building with a
minimum $4 million asking price.
Onjan. 18 the bids for the property
were opened, and on Jan. 22 they
were made public on thelwebsite
for Fourth River Development, the
Pittsburgh Public School’s agent in
this transaction.

The four bids placed ranged from
$4 million to $5.2 million. The poten-
tial use of the site is split — two of the
bidders would like to use the site to
start up a new school while the other
two want to focus on transforming it
into a residential area.

Ralph A. Falbo Inc., a Pittsburgh-
based company, and Beacon Com-
munities Development, whose
headquarters is located in Boston,
are entering a joint venture partner-
ship and placing a bid of $4 million.
If selected, the companies plan on
usingthe area to construct about 123
market—rate apartments with an on-
site gym. The pool and gym that are
currently a part of the high school
will be removed. _ _

Ralph Falbo, president of Ralph
A. Falbo, Inc. said the gymnasium
and pool were a part of an addition
to the building made in the last 20
years. He added thatthis portionwill
be demolished and replaced with a
parking lot,'which will be shielded
from the surrounding neighborhood
byadecorativewalland landscaping.

Aside from these changes, Falbo

 

said, the buildingwill largely remain
the same. A

“Nothing else will be changed in
the building,” he said. '

Technology entrepreneur Edward
Alexei, who is also a Schenley High
School and Pitt alum, and a group
of fellow investors placed a bid of
$4.1 million. They plan to set up a
private secondary school with extra
emphasis on the arts, such as digital
animation, ﬁlm production, game
development and the ‘performing
arts. The existing gym and pool are
expected to remain.

If approved by the Andy War-

hol Institute, the new school will be
named “Andy Warhol School of Vi-

‘sual and Performing Arts” after the

famous American artist and South
Oakland resident who graduated

' from Schenley in 1945.

Alexei could not be reached for
comment. '

Provident Charter Schools in
combination with Kossman Devel-
opment Company — both of which
are based in Pittsburgh — placed a
bid of $4.6 million in order to fulﬁll
their plans of constructing a school
and a housing area.

Curtis Kossman, president of
Kossman Development Company,
said he planned to develop a school
for.children with special needs.-

“Half of the building would serve

‘ childrenwith dyslexia,with the inten— -

tion to have these children under-
stand_their strengths and weaknesses
and to give them a ﬁmdamental skill
in reading and writing,” Kossman
said. -
Kossman said that the other half
of the building would be used for a
student housing project so that they

A group of studies co-authored by a
Pitt professor could leave Facebook
users asking why they spend time
deciding what photo of themselves
to use as a proﬁle picture or what sta-
tus update to share with everyone.
The ﬁve studies, collectively titled
“Are Close Friends the Enemy? On-
line Social Networks, Self—Esteem,
and Self— Control,” found that online
social network users who value close
friends’ opinions more experience a
greater self-esteem boost and loss
of self—control from using the sites.
Co—authored by Andrew T. Ste-

phen, an assistant professor in Pitt’s

Katz Graduate School of Business
and Keith Wilcox, an assistant pro-
fessor of business at Columbia Uni-
versity, the studies will be published
in an upcoming issue of Journal of
Consumer Research. The stud-
ies explore how Facebook use can
have a detrimental effect on users’
self-control, thus contributing to
poor self—control in health, mental
persistence and managingﬁnances.
As Stephen and Wilcox see it,
Facebook users have a lot of control
over their online representation: Bad
photos can be untagged and nasty
posts deleted. After seeing the best

V version of themselves and their so-

cial life online, the study points out,
users feel virtuous. These effects are

brief, according to researchers, but

increase self-esteem

might be enough to incite negative
consequences. ~

In one part of the study, some
subjects browsed Facebook while
others read TMZ or CNN. Research-
ers then offered each group a choice

_between a healthy snack or junk

food. The Facebook users took the
chocolate chip cookies.

The researchers believe this to
be a result of the boost in self—con-
ﬁdence stemming from Facebook
users’ control overwhat they see and
do not see on their newsfeed. Ac-
cording to Stephen, that conﬁdence
boost, however short-lived, makes
people feel OK about that one extra
cookie or splurging on something

that the total cost of the entire project including

bid of $5.2 million. Its proposal states that the

they normally wouldn’t.

The link between high self—esteem and low
self- control is not a new discovery.

“It’s called the licensing effect,” Stephen
said. “And it has been observed in a whole
bunch of other instances.”

Another example of this would be if some-
one went to purchase a present for afriend and
afterward, feeling virtuous, purchased one for
himself. According to the study, the increase
in self-esteem associated with the purchase
of a gift for another person is similar to that
experienced by a frequent Facebook user.

marketing major, said she isn’t surprised at

own posted content is received by her friends.
“I automatically go to Facebook,” she said,‘
“or Twitter.”
Stephen said he appreciated her point.
“Facebook is really good - at reminding
people to check Facebook,” he said.
Lammert said she knows better than to pro-
crastinate on the social network and will ﬁght
the urge to scan her newsfeed if she has enough

work on her plate. But without the pressure of ‘

deadlines and looming tests, Facebook poses
a serious threat to _her concentration.

“Yeah, I deﬁnitely ﬁnd it harder to study
after 20 minutes on Facebook,” she said. “It’s
just so hard when [Facebook] is on your phone
too.”

Now that Facebook is mobile, someone
can repeatedly access Facebook —— and that

Stephen said he isn’t sure ifpeople   “

“I’m not an evolutionary psycholog'ist,’i he’ '
said. “But people learn. They a gut feeling "
there is something wrong, and they adjust?’ :' ’

Lammert said she tried to go cold turkey
on the social network last year.

“I deactivated [my account] about a year
ago for three months beginning in Febru-
ary,” she said. “My grades were ﬁne. I was
just spending so much time on it.”

But not all Facebook users are as suscep-
tible to the website’s effects.

Questioning the futur

 

  e of the slate

“ system in Pitt’s SGB  ,_

John Hasley
For The Pitt News

We might like to thinkwe live in ade-
mocracy, but even on Pitt’s campus,
our attempts at political representa-
tion are hardly that. V

A little more than a year ago, then-
Student Government Board Elections
Chairwoman Kari Rosenkaimer at-
tempted to abolish the slates of two
or three SGB, candidates by chang-
ing the Board’s elections code. “At-
tempted” is the operative word here;

- her timing was a bit off. At the time,

there were two people on this cam-
pus who were preparing to run for
SGB president, and both of them had
already amassed their slates and the
supporting infrastructure that goes
along with it. Additionally, and un-
fortunately for Rosenkaimen she
would need Board approval for her

_ proposed change to the code, and

both of these eventual presidential
candidates were Board members at
the time of her proposal. ,
One of them was me. In our pri-
vate Board meeting, I remember
virulently and successfully arguing
against , a ', g that it
would unfairly harm “those peo
who had already put slates together,
and whose efforts with the passage
oﬁthis proposed change would have
been for naught. Though I couched

 

my argument in terms of timing, I
was really defending the slate sys-
tem as an institution. It had gotten
me electedas a Board member, and
I wanted to preserve it as a way for
people like me to retain the reins of
power in SGB.

Now, I am not ashamed to say that
I am flip—ﬂopping: The slate system
is doing more harm than good to our
way of student government.

Don’t get me wrong, this is not
meant to be a rebuke to the members

ofthe 2013 Board (all ofwhom ran on _

slates). I supported and campaigned
for both the Forbes and Fiﬁh slates
because I believed that they all had
personal integrity and great ideas
that I wanted to see implemented on
my campus. However, SGB’s electoral
process is not immune from the same
kind of slanting that plagues that of
our national political institutions.
Too often the big and powerful are
able to crowd out the small and weak.
To justify such a system, we must ask
ourselves this question: What char-
acteristic makes an SGB candidate
deserving of election‘? Is it integrity?
Dedication? The quality ofhis or her
platform? Or is it just afootrace to see
who can get the most popular mem-

-bers, f the most powerﬁil campus
o wmﬁQte?

column. -The.‘l‘slate': system”.to‘which
I refer does not include every slate
that has ever been formed. Every SGB
election is basically a competition
between two “super—slates” or a pair
of slates (six members total) cam-
paigning as one slate. Ifyou’ve been
a Pitt student for longer than two
years, you might remember some of
these past SGB campaign matchupsi
Truth and Virtue vs. Unity and Fam-
ily (2010), Blue and Gold vs. Panther
Pride and Panther Progress (2011)
and of course, Forbes and Fifth vs.
Steel and Stone (2012). All of these
matchups were between super—slates,
all of which dominated at the polls.

Additionally, these super—slates
are comprised of the same faces.
Greeks, Pathﬁnders and Blue and
Gold Society members (among some
others) have all historically main-
tained avast disparity between their
presence in the non-College of Gen-
eral Studies undergraduate popu-
lation and their representation on
SGB. Inthis respect, the slate system
seems to be a mechanism whereby a
relatively small slice of campus can
reserve positions ofpowerforfriends
while intimidating and denying out-
siders.

Contrary to what you might be
thinking at this point, the people who

not evil, power-hungry, egomaniacal jerks.
Knowing quite a few, I can tell you that among
them are some of the most honest, kind, hard-
working and decent individuals I have ever

known. However, the electoral process they

perpetuate every year is not one where every
candidate gets a fair shake. Super—slates can
rally support from their expansive social net-

works, blindingimthesesvoters to tlieiideas of ’

non—super-slate candidates. We shouldn’t be
punishing super-slates for their popularity,
but that popularity should not be the primary
reason they get elected. We need to promote
an electoral system that puts each candidate’s
ideas on an equal footing. But how?

It’s a daunting task, one which I don’t believe
can be completely remedied by a change to SGB
electoral policy. Even if slates were abolished,
most candidates would probably form an in-
formal network of communication and support
with other candidates, effectively reproducing
somelqf the sggiie results of the state system.

But SGB need not be complicit in this process.
Its elections code should take a harder line on
slates, even to the point of making them and
all of the campaign material that goes with
them illegal. ‘ V I
Regardless of the proposed policy change,
it is important to recognize that those who run
for SGB do not do so on an even playing ﬁeld.

President-elect Gordon Louderback and the-

rest of his Board should not let this issue rest
on the back burner until it is too late. _

It is a little-known SGB tradition for Board
mem,_be.rs;1;ol'sign eir desks after they have

completed a term, leaving some words of wis-
dom fortheir successors. Not knowingwhat to

- write, I decided on the most beautiﬁil line of

literature I had ever read. The ﬁnal line from
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel “The Great Gatsby”:
“So, we beat on, boats againstthe current,
borne back ceaselessly into the past.” 2013
SGB: Please do not put off discussing the merits
of the slate system, please do not settle for the

mistakes of other Boards, please do not bear ,

this campus and its students back, ceaselessly
into the past. I ‘

“Former SGB candidates object to election-

is interested in the elections process; as a fair,
smoothly run election is in the best interest of
all non-College of General Studies undergradu-
ates. Indeed, this unprecedentedly conten-
tious election saw its share of unprecedented
problems. And many changes are going to be

considered for the elections code, particularly _ . ..

to the sections concerning the papercampaign,
posting restrictions, endorsementsand slates.

Additionally, my hope is _that_throughout}§thel

of civility among the: candidates in the next
election. I also expect the Pitt community to
care-enough about our student government to
hold the committees and Board accountable
for their actions. A

  Possesser of a three-
game win streak, Pitt

  prs for DePaul

Despite its record, DePaul could give the Panthers a challenge Saturday.

Vaughn Wallace | For the Pitt News

Nate Barnes
Senior Stqff Wrz'ter

When the Pitt men’s basketball team
takes the ﬂoor at noon Saturday at the
Petersen Events Center, it will do so
against ateam that hasn’t won inthe
last three weeks.‘ j

DePaul is teetering on the verge
of last place in the Big East, but Pitt
knows betterthanto overlook it. Last
year DePaul squeaked outcan 84-81

victory. And a two-win Providence" ‘V

team almost upended the Panthers
on Tuesday before losing by four.
On the ﬂoor, the Panthers (16-4,
4-3 Big East) knowthe Chicago school
will look to pressure Pitt at all ends
of the ﬂoor with a full-court press,
attempting to force turnovers and

induce quick shots from its opponent.

“We know aboutthe pressing.and
the tempo,” head coachjamie Dixon
said. “A little bit similar to Provi-
dence, I guess, so kind of feeding
into what we prepared for,”

On aper-game basis, DePaul (10-
8, 1-4 Big East) ranks third in steals
amongall BigEastteams, behind only
Louisville and Syracuse. The Blue
Demons register roughly 9.6 thefts
every game. But on the opposite side,

‘DePaul is one oftheworst teams 
the conference in terms of taking  ' ~

of the basketball itself, losing posses-
sion almost 15 times a game — the
third-worst mark in the conference.

Megan Boyle
Stqff Wrz'ter

With the exception of the men’s
basketball team, which faces DePaul
at the Petersen Events Center on Sat-
urday at4 p.m., Pitt sports teams are
traveling to take on their competitors
this weekend. I '

Here’s a preview of all the teams
in action.

1 p.m. — Women’s Tennis at
Buffalo

On Saturday, the women’s tennis
team is traveling to Buffalo to play an
afternoon match against the Bulls.
The Pitt team is coming off a strong
6-1 season-opening victory against
St. Francis, which marked the 10th
season-opening victory in the past

.11 years_for the program. With both

teams possessing 1-0 records —— Buf-

falo won its season opener against

Niagara —— the teams’ skills seem to

’ match up well for both singles and

doubles play. Pitt’s No. 1 doubles team
of’I‘aylor.Washington andjocelyn Lu
is hoping to continde*its«hot start,

' having won every set this season.

4 p.m. — Women’s Basketball
at Georgetown
The women’s basketball team will

Pitt travels to Lock Haven onsaturtiay to resume conference play. Claire Deahl I Staff Photographer

‘be traveling to Washington D.C. with
- the remaining hope of gaining its ﬁrst

conference win against the Hoyas on
Saturday afternoon. The Lady Pan-
thers played a tough game Wednes-
day against No. 2 Notre Dame, losing
73-47. Asia Logan did not see action
in the Notre Dame game and her re-
turn date to the lineup is unknown.
She injured her shoulder last Decem-
ber against Georgetown and missed
the rest of the season. Pitt is currently
9-9 overall and 0-5 against Big East
Conference schools. Although their
present record is an improvement
from last year’s, the Panthers will face
stiff competition'against a strong op-
ponent. The Hoyas are 11-7 overall
and 2-3 in conference.

7 p.m. — Wrestling at Lock
Haven
Following a loss at then-No. 2

. Oklahoma State, the wrestling team

will travel to Lock Haven, Pa., Satur-
day evening in an Eastern Wrestling
League match. The team hopes to
gain another win and pick up mo-

, iunentum against unranked Lock Ha-

ven. For its upcoming home matches,
including hosting No. 1 Penn State
on Feb 8., senior Zac Thomusseit,
wrestling at the 285 weight class, will
be lookingto improve his 18-2 record

this weekend
along with fellow senior Matt Wilps
(197 pounds, 14-1).

7 p.m. — Gymnastics

The gymnastics team will be ven-
turing to State College this weekend
to compete against Penn State, Iowa
and Rutgers. This will be the team’s
ﬁrst competition since news broke
of its national rank of 22nd. The Pan-
thers’ opponents this weekend are

- ranked No. 30, 34 and 40, respec-

tively. It’s Pitt’s ﬁrst top-25 ranking
of the season. Pitt also has a gymnast
ranked in the top 10 in the conference
for each individual event, making
for a highly anticipated match all
around.

5 p.m. today and 10 a.m. Sat-
urday — Swimming and Diving

For the second week in a row, Pitt
will face off against one of its rivals.
Both the men’s and women’s swim-
ming and diving teams will travel to
the Philadelphia area to compete at
Villanova for a two—day meet begin-
ning today. Both Pitt squads are com-
ing off a rivalry win against West Vir-
ginia that put the men’s and women’s
record at 3-2 and 1-1 in conference
matchups. Now they must prepare
for in-state and conference rival Vil-
lanova, which has a record of 1-3 r3}
men and 2-2 for women. I

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN -

No. 3 Syracuse  alone at the top of

Nate Barnes
Senior Stag/ff Wrz'ter

The Big East continues to be  well, the Big
East, where any period of success cannot be
sustained — at least not for long. Take Louis-
ville. After gaining the top ranking nationally
last Monday, Syracuse promptly knocked the
Cardinals off Saturday. Then]ayWright’s Wild-

cats did the same against Rick Pitino’s squad _

Tuesday night in Philadelphia.

Parity is alive and well in this dying confer-
ence as seven Big East units have already lost
three times in conference play, and 11 teams
are within only 3 1/2 games of the undefeated
Orange for the conference’s top spot.

1. No. 3 Syracuse (18-1, 6-0 Big East)

Syracuse remains the only undefeated
team standing in conference play. It upset

then-No. 1 Louisville this past weekend and '

then survived a scare from No. 21 Cincinnati
on Monday. With the loss of second—leading
scorerjames Southerland, point guard Michael
Carter—Williams has stepped his game up with
his back-to-back 16-point outings, highlighted
by his victory—sealing dunk in the ﬁnal minute
Saturday against Louisville.

2. No. 5 Louisville (16-3, 4-2)

This just wasn’t Louisville’s week. But if
basketball fans know one thing, it’s that Rick
Pitino will have the Cardinals back on track
and at the top. Take last year’s Final Four run,
which happened after a 2-4 start in conference
play. And just as in years past, Big East play
won’t get any easier. Louisville has two difﬁcult
games coming up — next against Georgetown
on Saturday and then a home match—up with
Pittsburgh on Jan. 28.

3. No. 21 Cincinnati (16-4, 4-3)

Cincinnati started Big East play strong and
then suffered a couple of tough losses, but
now the team seems to be improving again
with an overtime win against Marquette — a
team that had previously been undefeated in
the Big East — and a marginal two-point loss
against Syracuse.

4. No. 25 Marquette (13-4, 4-1)

The Golden Eagles have only played one

MCT Campus

I game in the past week, and it ended in a loss to

Cincinnati on Saturday. Buzz Williams’ squad
will face some of the conference’s bottom

dwellers in the upcoming week, but a matchup .

with No. 5 Louisville looms Feb. 3.
5. Pittsburgh (16-4, 4-3)

Three consecutive wins for head coach '

Jamie Dixon have the Panthers above .500 in
Big East play for the ﬁrst time in over a season,
and the Panthers should be able to continue to
move beyond that mark with a contest against
DePaul on Saturday. However, the Panthers
will run the gauntlet after that game, facing No.
5 Louisville and No. 3 Syracuse in succession.

6. St.John’s (12-7, 4-3) .

Like Pittsburgh, the Red Storm has strung
together three straight wins and should be
able to push that streak further with games

against Seton Hall and DePaul on the docket ~

for the upcoming week. Ditmgelo Harrison
continues to ﬁll up the bucket, averaging 19.6

points per game — the conference’s second— ,

best scoring mark.

The Orange ae ndefeated in conference play, giving fans something to cheer about.

:,.,-.r~.

7. Villanova (12-7, 3-3) _

Coming off tl1ree straight losses, the Wild-
cats pulled out an upset win over No. 5 Louis-
ville on Tuesday by a nine—point margin that
drew fans at the Wells Fargo Center onto the
court in celebration. But their opponents don’t

get easier — at least not yet — with Villanova

taking on Syracuse Saturday.
8. Georgetown (13-4, 3-3) - /' _

Just as the Hoyas started to appear as if they
were turning things around, they went down to
Tampa and dropped their game against South
Florida, 61-58. Of course the Hoyas then rolled

' into then-No. 20 Notre Dame’s home and won a

nice bounce-back game. Georgetown will have

another chance at knocking off a top team this

weekend with ahome game against Louisville.
9. No. 24 Notre Dame (15-4, 3-3)

_ Since the Irish started strong with wins
against Seton Hall and Cincinnati, they have
lost three of the past four games with the only
win coming by three points against Rutgers.

‘Head coach Mike Brey needs to right the ship

the Big East, for now

soon, as it seems ND faces a breaking point
here in its season.

10. Connecticut (12-5, 2-3)

UConn might have one of the best back-
courts in the nation, but an injury to Shabazz
Napier’s shoulder has him playing at less than
100 percent, and Ryan Boatright carmot carry
theload himself. Coming off a long layoff after
losing to Pitt on Saturday, UConn will get a

chance to even its conference record Sunday

g _ at home against Rutgers.

11. Rutgers (12-6, 3-4)

After putting together strong wins against
Pitt and St.John’s, the Scarlet Knights have lost
three of their last four, with the only win being
a three-point victory over USE It won’t get
easier for Rutgers, with games against UConn,
Cincinnati, Louisville and Georgetown making
up the team’s next four scheduled cpntests.

12. Providence (10-9, 2-5)

Although the Friars are currently tied for

most losses in the Big East, Providence has ‘

provided reason for optimism. Bryce Cotton
leads the conference in scoring at 21.9 points
per game, and Providence played close games
against Pittsburgh and Syracuse thatcould
have gone to the Friars.

13. Seton Hall (13-6, 2-4)

After four consecutive losses. in confer-
ence play, the Pirates rebounded with a home
victory over USF. Seton Hall faces two win-
nable games coming up against St. John’s and
Georgetown.

14. South Florida (10-8, 1-5) ,

By knocking off Georgetown, USF pulled
itself out of the conference basement for the
time being. But the Bulls followed that up with
a loss to Seton Hall on Wednesday and will
have to face Marquette and Connecticut in
the coming days.

15. DePaul (10-8, 1-4)

DePaul hasn’t‘won a game in almost three
weeks, dropping three in a row. The Blue De-
mons did give Cincinnati some trouble, staying
close to the Bearcats at home, but they couldn’t
pick up the win. DePaul will have to face a hot
Pitt team and then a strong St. John’s team,
with both games on the road. I

will attempt to take the ball Saturday, have been
stellarwhen it comes to ball securitythis season.’
Pitt has turned the ball over just 200 times in
its 20 games, an average of 10 per game —— the
lowest mark of any team in the conference.

In addition to keeping track of the basket-
ball, Pitt will need to play at its own pace and
not allow DePaul to control the game’s tempo
as a means of pulling the Panthers out of their
comfort zone.

“They’re ateam of streaks, they’re a team of
runs. They get up and down, shoot quick, and
they make you shoot quick [which] Ithink is the
biggest thing we’re trying to get across,” Dixon
said. “I thought we did a good job against Provi-
dence of getting layups when they were available

 

and not settling for contested jumpshots.”
Combatingthe Blue Demons’ efforts to hurry
the Panthers will fall on the shoulders of Pitt’s
guards, especially freshman point guardjames
Robinson, who plays a heavy role in limiting

Pitt’s turnover tallies and whose 3.59 assist- .

to-tumover ratio ranks among the best in the
nation.

“We know DePaul’s going to bring some of
the pressure like Providence did,” Robinson
said. “They’re not the ﬁrstteam that’s pressured
us this season.”

Also in the backcourt, junior guard Trey
Zeigler might bring the ball up the ﬂoor when
Robinson and senior Travon Woodall receive
their breathers on the bench. Zeigler spoke of
how the team has been coming together and
rebounding better as of late, but he also knows
what it takes to continue success.

“We’ve just gotta continue doing the little

things, hustling and getting on loose balls.
Coach [Dixon] has been stressing on those
things,” Zeigler said.

Defensively, Dixon knows the Blue Demons’
scoring abilities, especially those of Cleveland
Melvin and Brandon Young. ,

“We know about Melvin, and we know about
Young and what those guys can do,” Dixon said.

Melvin and Young constitute one-of the
conference’s highest-scoring tandems, with
Melvin putting up 17.6 points per game from
his forward position and Young scoring 16.7

per game while operating out on theperimeter. .

Both playersrank amongthe top 10 leading

1‘ scorers in the Big East, with Melvin owning

the highest ﬁeld goal percentage (49.8 percent)
among those players. A
On the Panthers’ end, one has to think Pitt
will need some sort of contribution out of'I‘alib
Zanna, who still leads Pitt in scoring at 11.7

points per game, despite scoring only 23 points
in Pitt’s last four contests.

On the perimeter, Woodall is also averag-
ing double-digit scoring with his mark of 10.7
points per game and leads the team in assists,
handing out 5.7 per game -— the conference’s
ﬁﬁzh-best average. . I

But as oflate, Pitt’s hottest player, without a
doubt, has been redshirt junior forward Lamar
Patterson, who has elevated his game since
the beginning of Big East play. Patterson now
averages 10 points, four rebounds and four
assists per game.

Recently his performances haveiincluded
a career-high 22 points against Marquette on
Jan. 12, 14 points against UConn on Saturday
and 17 points Tuesday at Providence. In seven
conference games, Patterson is averaging 11.6_
points per game while scoringin doubleﬁgures
in four of those games. I
