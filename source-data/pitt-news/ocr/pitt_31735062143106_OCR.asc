A poll conducted by News

weeks reveals that an overwhelm-

formal Spring Festival dance.
Congress ruled that since a
semi-formal affair was socially in-
correct, the dance would be in-
formal for two reasons. In the
ﬁrst place, the Spring Festival
committee was undecided at the
time of the meeting with Con-
gress; secondly, Congress felt that

NASA Fails To Oust: Frats;
Only I000 Men Trek to Polls

Expected competition from an independent slate in oppositionto the fraternity control _

of student government failed to materialize Wednesday when every fraternity-backed candi-

date was swept into office.

Only 957 voters, 14 percent of an eligible 7000, bothered to march across the street to
the Soldiers and Sailors memorial hall to cast ballots in the annual spring elections for men.
The Weak vote, however, did not affect results of the proposed amendments -to the Con-
gress constitution. Both amendments passed by an almost ﬁve-to-one majority. The ﬁrst addi-

Gtion to the constitution is a convenience measure for the ofﬁces of

the deans of men and women. The second puts teeth into the con-
gress method of adoption of constitutional changes.

Fraternity men captured Student congress by a ﬁve-to-three . it
vote and moved into every position on the council by an even"

greater margin. A concerted eﬁort on the part of the Non-aﬂiliated

students association, led by council candidate Bill Lytle, to round up

the necessary plurality proved ineffectual.

Brunettes Get Hand to Fame ~
Through Bob Hope Picture

Pitt’s “Favorite Brunette” contest begins today.

Petition forms for entrants in Bob Hope’s “My Favorite Brunette”
contest, Pitt edition, are available in the office of the dean of men.
Completion of a petition is the ﬁrst step in the elimination procedure

be started by a friend, rather than the girl herself, but that no girl

may be nominated without hei¢

written consent, which should be
attached to the petition. The dead-
line ‘for the return of the forms to
theofﬁce of the dean of men is
12:30 p.m. Thursday, March 20.
Final approval from each girl will
then be secured through a phone
call or letter from the student
congress appointed contest com-
mittee.

Candidates for Pitt’s Favorite
Brunette will be judged on the
basis of general appearance, per-
sonality, scholarship. and Partici-
pation in campus activities. Final

selection will be made by the en-

tire student body, though details 

of theelection process have not
yet been settled. The University’s
representative will then appear

with the nominee from each of‘7

the other four local colleges and
universities for the ﬁnal choice
by a board of judges.

Pittsburgh's winning brunette

and girls chosen from 14 other 
cities will be met by Bob Hope in

To the Editor: S’

In your issue of Friday, March
7, you raise the perennial ques-
tion: What is wrong with Pitt

The truth is there is nothing
wrong with the students at Pitt

ban institution. The great mass of
students do live at home. Yet that
is no excuse to cheat the students
out of what is rightfullytheirs--_

The programs of the -Dean of
Men and the Dean of Women are
woefully lacking in fulﬁlling the
need of 90% of the students, at

of the men’s office which is sup-
posed to serve all the men on
campus. Fifty women would
crowd the facilities of the twelfth
ﬂoor, crowded and cluttered as it
is with medieval junk that belongs
in a third-rate museum,

The entire blame for the de-
sultory attitude of Pitt students
should not lie entirely in these
two ofﬁces, although improved.
vision of the needs of the students
should be forthcoming.

‘The great need of the Univer-
sity now is some central place
where the social life of the stu-
dents could be concentrated._ A
well—equipped s t u d en t union
would do much to solve the prob-
lem, I mean a building three or
four stories high, planted right on
the campus, smack up against the
Cathedral. It should be built with
vision, designed to handle the ac-
tivities for at least 30-00 students
at one time. There should be a
large dance floor, game rooms of
all sorts (cards, checkers, bowl-
ing, pool), meeting rooms for ac-
tivities, places where hobbies can
be pursued (woodworking, paint-
ing, etc.). I’m sure students" could
suggest a thousand other .things
that such a building could con-
tain.

‘ Thus you could have a place,
where the students social and cul-
tural life could be concentrated.
If such a place were built and
managed properly, I think you
would note a great change in the
attitude of Pitt students toward
the University.

But along with such a building,
and even before it is built, there
must 'come a new vision of the
importance of student activities
for all Pitt students. The damp
cloud of do-nothing, the old way
is best. must be blown away.
There‘ are men and women in the
deans’ oﬂices who are capable and
at" lin to j

  A

The building wouldn’t cost
much. For all the money spent on
tea that nobody drinks, the ﬁrst
ﬂoor could have been completed.
The University just spent $500,000

to dig up the campustand plant

pipes. Such a building I propose

wouldn’t cost ‘much .more, than

that. I’m wining. to give one
month's ‘GI check to plaster the
new place. _

And if on opening day, we spot

a -Gothic wastebasket planted_

there in the midst of our game

room, we’ll use it for ﬁrewood,_

And if you see a woman student
making? like a church window,
andholding a pot of tea, direct
her to the twelfth ﬂoor. That
ﬂoor should become the Univer-
sity museum.

Dear Editor: —

Since the Panther hasn’t made
allowance for open criticism by a
Letter to the Editor column the
only way to express our opinion
is through the Pitt News.

Firstilof all, we would like to
ask the Panther staff certain ques-
tions; 1.) Did the Panther take a
large enough representative sam-

pling of the student body in the.’

poll? ,2.)_ Does the Panther think
that Pitt students can see humor
in sex only? 3.) Does the Panther
have to use its publication as a

means’ of carrying on personal.

feuds and slamming other campus
organizations? ‘

We realize that the Panther is,

just coming back, but surely Pitt
students are capable of producing
a better magazine. This is cer-

. tainly not the type of magazine

we want to circulate to represent
the University of Pittsburgh.

The subject matter, besides be-
ing below the level of college
readers, includes only three ar-
ticles that are not crammed full
of sex expressed in a very crude
manner. ‘ ‘ I I

And to think that for all this
yellow journalism we had to
spend 25 cents,

Election Views

Edd/ito1"s Note: This article "was

. written by an‘ independent estu-
' dent and does ‘not necessarily; re-'

flect the opinions or views of the
News,

So you’re going to organize"

and beat the Greek at their game? '

All of ‘your protestations were
as empty’ word-Ts. Theclection re-
sults expose -the calilzre of your
intentions.

I’m an independent and I ran
for Men’s council. I -was defeated.
But that’s not why I’m sore.

Lookfat the facts; Ni'ne.,hun-
dred and’_ fifty-seven men voted.
(The men "student enrollment is
7000) Six hiindred of the vot-
ers were Greeks, the remainder

were independent.

The trouble is that too many in-
dependents are too interested in

being “independentf’. Why should"

they trudge a few steps out of, the

way to vote? Getting home ﬁve .
minutes earlier meant more Suck—‘ 

ingon a straw in the Tuck shop
meant more.-

The excuse that you didn’t
know the candidate is a weak
one. How .. many ‘fraternity men

personally knew, their candidates 
on their slate? Is personal ac— ‘
quaintance with the candidate ‘a »

criterion for voting in municipal,
state or national elections. ‘

Independents, you’re had .your
day to shout! The volume of your
shout wouldnt ‘blow up a penny

' balloon.

Don’t moan about fraternity
control. It reasonably belongs‘ to
the Greeks. It would hardly = be
logical to deny the right of con-
trolto that group ‘Wh.ch’ display-
ed uniﬁed backing.

The unfortunate aspect is that
student leaders represent the
choice of only 14 per centoithe
enrollment. Is this government
by the students for the majority?

So to all you striving indepen-
dents, who are crying in your
beer, just keep on crying’ until
you get the. idea that
Won’t accomplish anything and
by all means don’t say “waituntil'

Royal Couple
Will Reign 1
Over IF Ball

Pitt Greeks are set to pay hom-
age to their king and queen at
the Interfraternity Spartan ball,
Friday, March 28 inthe main ball-
room of the William Penn hotel.

The royal couple, an innovation
in IF dance policy, will be se-
le-cted by a drawing prior to the
ball. The name of the lucky‘ fra-
ternity will be pulled from a high
silk hat. The select fraternity
will name the sovereign couple to
reign to the music of Elliot Lawr-
ence. The selecting fraternity
must pledge not to reveal the
identity of the king and queen

‘until the night of the ball.

Elliot Lawrence and his or-
chestra is the ﬁrst “name band” to
make its appearance on campus
for a formal dance this year.
Lawrence has combined the run-
of-the-mill styles of present-day

name bands with his own ideas

in music.

Lawrence, the most talked about
maestro of today, is only 21 years
old. Odd dance band instruments

like the oboe, french horn, bas- ‘

soon, and english horn, featured
in his orchestra, accounts for

much of the “newness” which is
making his colleagues in band-

Jean Stickle is still vibrating

Fanny Gilson’s trip to North-

Joe Cook’s party Saturday night
was a ﬁne affair. Jim Dowd slept

That was a nice pajama-top
Franklin Blackstone wore to school
Tuesday. He’s always thinking
about bed anyway, so it’s all
right.

A funny thing happened to me
the other day. I was walking out

But we won’t let them keep their

banquets last week. The ﬁrst was
a smoker at Web Hall with Dick

other was a Founder’s Day ban-
quet at the University club; and",

The Shadyside Tuck shop, that
elaborate room surrounded by
bare cellar walls, continues to be

the main problem at the Acade-

my building.

This semester, although over
250 new students were added to
the daily attendance, only three
new tables were added to the al-
ready crowded conditions in the

‘Tuck shop. Quite a few new chairs

should be added.

Too many times students at
Shadyside don’t know about cur-
rent school affairs until it is too
late. The situation would improve
with the addition of a bulletin
board.

Chow lines get longer every
day in the Tuck shop, particularly
the soup line. Could it be that
more men are eating, or that more
help is needed on the serving
line? ,

Everybody at Shadyside looks
forward to spring. Couldtit be

Pitt’s Mike now has his f‘Pat”
in Harold (Josh) Williams.
.Former Panther halfback and,
veteran of 14 years of coaching?
experience, Josh rejoins, his close
friend and one-time roommate]
~ Mike Milligan after a parting of
six years. The University of Flor-‘,
ida and coach Josh Cody last saw!
the two gridmen together. with
Milligan leading the linemen‘ and
Williams handling the backﬁeld
chores. '

Josh ﬁrst came to Pitt in 1927,
after graduating from Bellefonte
academy and studying football
under Carl Snavely. A season of
freshman ball under Dr. H, C.
Carlson gained him a regular

, varsity position for his last three
years. V

Ground-gaining leader of the
.1928 Panthers", he suffered a leg
injury in the early part of the ’29
season which sidelined him for a
big part of the fall ‘season.

Moving to Beaver high after
his graduation from the Univer-
sity, Josh stayed ﬁve years as
head coach there before returning

alto" his alma mater as assistant
backﬁeld mentor in 1937. He went
to Florida next; then in 1941 he
succeeded Henry Frnka at Tem-
ple. .

1947 ﬁnds him once again at
Pitt, and very happy about the
whole thing. He’s only been in
town a few days, but Josh re-

-tive of the ﬁne treatment I’ve.
received.”

Pitt" and its athletic policies
check right in with the able new
,coach’s ideas. “We’re going to
have the best football team We
can,” .he declares, “and it twill
‘ be in 1ine,with what the athletic
H department wants.”

Education comes ﬁrst on ‘a foot-
ball pl»ayer’s schedule, Josh con-
itinuesj. He explains athletics are
an extra.-curricular ' activity, and
_a great aid is to be friendly with
all‘ the students. “Mingle, coop-
erate, and be part of ‘the univer-
sity” are Josh Williams’ by-laws.

Nine Old Men‘
Hold Top Spot
In Legal Loop

Although spring sports are pre-
paring to move in on basketball’s
monopoly of the intramural lime-
light, the hoop-hangers ‘are still
very much in circulation.

At the Cathedral gym, the pros-
pective lawyers were busy this
Week ﬁling their basketball briefs
against each another. Led by Caffe
and Camp, the Nine’ Old Men
turned back Tau Epsilon Rhd, 38-
24, to’ continue their league-lead-
ing drive through the legal loop.

In dumping the Legal Eagles
29-20, the Nemo A. C. gained its
ﬁrst victory. Although playing on
a losing club, Aldo Icardi of the
Nemo’s has been playing brilliant
ball. Little trouble was encoun-
tered by the Indiana Americanos
who romped over the Straw Men,
47-13. ‘

Meanwhile, in the physical edu-
cation league, the Benedetti club
upset the dope by cooling Herb
Douglass and his Pitt g10bet1'0t'
ters, 34-31. The victory shoved
the Benedetti’s into ﬁrst place.

Paced by Ed Burns and Ben
Lewis, the Dental Seniors eked
out a 26-25 win over the Dental
Freshmen. The brilliant play of
freshmen Elmer Lipp and John
Woodwas not quite enough to 1110-
set the Seniors in the battle for
ﬁrst place. , '

In the All-Star league, the Bus
Ad sophomores, handed the Med-
ical Sophs a 30-24” licking. The
Medical..Frosh absorbed a 57-30
drubbing dished out by the
Onesy-Twosy ﬁve.

Latest standings inthe‘ various
intramural loops show the Bene-
detti club in front of the Phys Ed
League; the Seniors, ahead in the
Dentalcircuit; Bus Ad Sophs, in
the All-Star league; and the Nine

ITIIPH The Roster . . . BILL GIEPLY  

Following the usual pattern of a. future college basketball‘ play-'

er, William Cieply began lobbing a basketball around sometime

during his grade school days.

He developed into a ﬁrst-stringer at Ford City high. school, 4

under the able tutelage of Neenie Campbell, now head mentor at

McKeesport high.

“Cheep’s” three years of varsity ball at Ford City were suffi-

cient to convince Pitt authorities that Bill should be awarded
a basketball scholarship. _ . - V ‘
' Keen‘ and Aggressive
Dr. Carlson noted Cieply’s keen and aggres
sive court work on‘the frosh squad in 1942 and
elevated him to the Panther varsity the following

year.
After displaying a ﬁne brand

Cieply grabbed ‘A Cieply

a berth on the regimental ﬁve at¢
Camp Croft, S. C. He points out
that, “We had a good regimental
team and the Pitt squad of ’43 was
excellent, but the Panther team

been on,” .

‘As a word of warning, Bill add-
ed, “A lot of rival coaches are
going to lose plenty of sleep next
year because with this year’s ex-
perience, the Carlsonmen are go-
ing to be one 'of the leading con-
tenders for top honors next year.”

The Panther -cage star consid-
ers the NYU ﬁve of ’43 the tough-
est he has ever played against.
During this year’s grind, he met
up with his all time “best oppon-
ent,” Leland Byrd of West Vir-
ginia. \ J

Six Panther Mermen

In Championship Meet
’ Six Panther merman and Coach Howard Waite- leave this

afternoon for Rutgers university, New Brunswick, N.’ J ., where
they will take part in the annual Eastern Intercollegiate cham-

pionship meet, tomorrow.

Bill Manko, 30-year old veteran and former POVV, is the
most promising candidate for the Pitt aggregation. To date,‘

rnmav, Manon 14. 1941 .

+2:

he has notched first place in every°

meet. His best time of the season
against competition was '1:45.8, in
the 150-yard back stroke.

Paul Brugger, former Erie East

I swimmer, is the best threat in
the 60—and l00—yard free style.
He has repeatedly won past races
and should show well in this meet.
His best time for the l00—yard
sprint this season waslaround 55
seconds. ,
A Another graduate of Erie East,

-Walt Jackson is a sprint man.
Jackson was former state cham-
pion in the shorter distances. He
has recorded a 55-second effort

. this season.

Don Wilde, Pittsburgh, follows
his brothers, Gus and Ralph, in
competing for the Panthers. Don,

,a freshman, has shown constant
improvement. in the 60—and 100-
yard free style. He also takes part
in the 440-yard relay.

Myron “Mike” Levine, another
newcomer to Pitt, consistently has
topped the ﬁeld in the 440-yard
free style.»Unable to set _the- pace,
Mike always, has the gﬁnal push
which brings him victory.

Last on the traveling squadof

‘the Jungle Cats is ‘Dave Cannon.

Dave is a dark , horse, and has‘
developed practically overnight. _

His "continuous improvement has
“won him a berth on the squad go-
ing to Rutgers. Although a sprint
man,“ Cannon will_ take’ part in
the 440—yard free style relay.
“The ﬁeld is large and com-
petition keen, but the .men
will try their best,” states
Coach Waite. “The experience‘
gained at the; Eastern Inter-
. collegiates will be‘ valuable in
preparing for next season,”
added the Panther mentor.

Panther Cagers

The Illinois “Whiz Kids” are really whizzes, at least in the
opinion of the Pitt Panther basketball squad. They chose Illinois
as the best opponent they faced this year. L

Ed Latagliata sums up the squad’s impression after their game
with the Illini in stating, “Those boys seemed to do everything‘ just
right all the time.”

Both Illinois and West Virginia placed two men on the Pitt
all-opponent ﬁve. Andy Phillip and Gene Vance were chosen first-
team forward. and guard respectively. Their running mates are West
Virginia stars, Fred Shaus and Leland Byrd. The center is Chet
Dembinski of Westminster.

Second-team choices are Sheppard and Yeoman of Army, Un-
dermann of Ohio State, Westminster’s McLhinney, and Illinois’ Smiley.

Gene Vance was an overwhelming choice as best individual ',

opponent. Shaus was rated second and teammate Byrd, was also
mentioned. . , I

Explaining his nomination of Vance, Dodo Canterna said, “He
is a good boardsman and a ﬁne shot, but he really excels on de-
fense.”

With their nomination of Illinois as the outstanding team they
have met this year, the Panther cagers agree, to a man, that the
Western Conference contenders were probably at their peak when
they met the Pitt five. I
