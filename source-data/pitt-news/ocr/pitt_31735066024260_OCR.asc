Geography Department. Faces

P_it.t‘s geography department faces possible elimination in August.
1983. if a proposal by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg takes effect. Citing a loss of faculty, inability to recruit a
chairperson, insufficient faculty researchsand a decrease in students
applying for majors, Rosenberg outlined the prioposalin a'VMay 28

taken by Rosenberg in 1977, when, he created a timetable that also
called for the depart‘rnent’selirnination in'l983. lthad been opposed at

Competition Advocat

To Cut Health Care Cost

By LINDA MILLER

Pitt News Stall Writer

Competition was advocated as a
means to cut spiraling health care
costs by two nationally known
health care authorities at a recent
conference sponsored by Pit't‘s
Health Policy Institute.

Both Drs. Alain Enthoven and

.Wal'ter McClure explained the com-
petition strategy—another
approach to financing health care
that would eliminate burdensome

federal regulations and open [up

- health services to free enterprise— to

the 3l6 representatives of hospitals.
medical organizations and health
care agencies present at the June 19
conference in the David Lawrence
Convention Center. 0
Enthoven. a professor of health
care economics at Stanford Univer-
sity. recommended giving people
choices “on an economically fair
basis" to change the system into one
that is cost-—effective. ‘

shown hospital costs can be cut
without sacrificing quality,
Enthoven pointed to several factors
that fuel costs, including needlessly
long hospital stays and unnecessary
. use of sophisticated technology.

Sharing many of _Enthoven‘s
views, McClure warned that failure
to act at the private level on the new
strategy would mean an eventual
takeover of the health industry by
the federal government.

According to McClure. the direc-
tor of Health Policy Group in Min-
neapolis. the underlying cause of
increasing health care costs, which
have risen 8] percent in the last five
years. is market failure and federal
regulations that have given little
0 incentive to provide quality service
at competitive prices. '

Both speakers noted that the idea
of the health care system as a free
enterprise with minimum federal
regulations is receiving serious con-

istration. Also, several pro-
competition bills have been
introduced into Congress. including

that would cut down on the out-of-
pocket medical expenses of the
-elderly.

that competition will not turn the
system around overnight. He esti-
mated that it will take from five to
ten years to eliminate a number oi

merit competitive health services to
all sectors of the population.

After a panel discussion, Dr.
Beaufort B. Longest. Jr., director of
Pitt’§. Health Policy Institute, con-
cluded the,conference with a sum-
mary and closing remarks. The
Institute, which is also sponsored by
the Allegheny Conference on Com-
munity Development. evaluates the
cost. quality and delivery of health
services in Western Pennsylvania
and is funded through grants from

J

corporate and family foundations.

The Real
Majority

Recently, Proctor & Gamble withdrew its sponsorship
from a group of television shows after being pressured by
The Coalition for Better.Television: which had deemed the
shows morally unacceptable. The popular argument against '
The Coalition and its biggest supporter, the Moral Majority,

is that these organizations infringe upon the rights ofothers. A V -

The argument fails in this particular ca'se—-the real issue
behind the success of the Coaliation’s boycott is not rights
but the general apathy about doing anything toprevent it.

The Coalition is well within its rights to demand that
certain ‘shows be discontinued. it is ironic that the anti-
Coalition people scream about rights. but deny these same
rights to the Coalition. This is not to say what the Moral
Majority and the Coalition demand is necessarily correct, or
that the tactics they use to achieve their results are fair or
ethical—-but they are legal.

But if a group with a vested interest yells loud enough.
they will be heard. Proctor & Gamble is a case in point.
There‘s' a question here of how much longer those people
who believe their rights are being violated—.that another
person‘s morality is being forced on them— will decide
they’ve had enough.

Yet if one can question the Moral Majority‘s methods in
deciding what the restof America watches on the television
screen——under the banner of “freedom ofspeech“——the Coa-
lition can also argue its case on the same grounds. The
boycotted sponsors have no obligation to rescind their,
endorsements of “offensive” shows. The Coalition, like it or
not, is simply practicing one form of non-violent protest.
Perhaps that is the most galling effect of the boycott: a
smaller group is. dictating their tastes at the expense of a
larger group—--and doing it legally. even morally, within

their rights. 9

The bottom line. as always, is money. It would be.a
’ courageous decision for a sponsor to announce that they Will
not bend to the wishes of a few—but it would also be
suicidal. Proctor & Gamble couldinadvertently earn the
reputation of “courageous" or “immoral." but notthemost .
advantageous label: “profitable.“ Courage and/ or immoral-
ity do not sell stockshares. ' e

What happens, then. when that larger segment ofsociety
decides that they’ve had enough indirect censorship from the
Coalition--what options are open to this majority‘? -The _
Coalition is fighting its war with the most effective weapo_nry
available in America: money. But how will the ‘rest ofAmer- '
ica arm itself‘? ‘ - '

Unfortunately, there are few avenues of escape. One
option is to buy from theisponsors being boycotted— an
expensive proposition. and many simply don’t like Proctor
& Gamble‘s products. Another option is to step-up the
current bumpersticker campaign: we envision thousands,
perhaps millions of cars bearing the slogan. “The Moral
Majority is‘neither moral nor a majority.” Somehow this
seems to lack viability. "

So, realistically, we may be burdened with watching tele-
vision programs tailoredto the whims ofa few. This situa-~

- tionwill change when and only when outraged viewers make
. - their numbers known: when thevreal majority comes outiof A

  Letters

Editor's Note: Robert H. Glew sent
a copy of this letter to The PittNcws.

To: Members of the Board of
Trustees

Subject; Tuition’ increases at the
' University of Pittsburgh School of

Medicine

From: Robert H. Glew, Associate

Professor of Biochemistry
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine

The tuition increases of approxi-
mately $3,000 (in-state residents) to
$5.000 (out-of-state residents) are
unconscionable and will make Pitt
the most expensive state or state-
associated medical school in the
country.- These 30-40% tuition
increases ‘are unwarranted; they are
the result of at least.5 years of the
most profound irresponsible mis-
management of resources by the
present- and previous Dean, Vice-
Chancellor Stark and Chancellor
Posvar. Before you throw your sup-
port behind the. tuition increase,
consider the following questions.

1. Why did not Dean Leon spend
the 1.5 million dollars from the
Allegheny Foundation to rebuild
the Department of Pharmacology as
specified in the original application?

2. Why were millions of dollars
from the Heinz _, Foundation not
spent to fillthree chaired professor-
ships in the School of Medicine?

3. Where did the $50,000 come
from that was paid out ofthe/Dean’s
office for the trips to Iran of I3 pro-
fessors from thejSchool of Medicine

who were part of a developing-

exchange program that would have

. paid" them each $1.000 ‘per diem?

4. W.hy‘is' there not a single prac-
tice plan in the School of Medicine
instead of l3"separate plans?

5. Why are the practice plans such

a guarded secret?

6.'Why. has there been no annual
audit of the millions of dollars that

'- flow through the practice plans?

- 7. How much moneyfrom the
practice plans in the last 5 years has
been used to ‘solve the problems in
the Basic Science Departments?

.8. Have,not. essentially all of the
practice plan _revenues from "the
Department, of Psychiatry "(and

other clinical departments)"

remained t_o'tally within that

‘department?

. 9. Why is there not a faculty com-

mittee to review the practice plans? _.

l0. Why have not ‘all of the

members ofthe Board of Trustees "

read the original reports of the
LCME evaluation team? _
ll. Why has -the Dean failed to

9‘ provide you with audits and original

copies of the practice plans and why

have you failed to call in consultants
from Duke. Stanford, etc. to evalu-
ate our practice plans? - -

l2. Why are tuition decisions

-reached after the ‘medical students
are away on summer" break, in a V
clandestine fashion with no formal‘

student input whatsoever? -

l3. Why islthe School unable to .
fill 4 out of 5 chairmanships in the .
A Basic Science Departments (some

for more than 6 years)?

_. ..l4. W»hy'do faculty members at i
' ' . . the .-l_lniv:ersi_tyj7 of Pittsburgh

 

the country not to accept positions
in the Health Center?

I5. Do you really feel comfortable
supporting a motion that will make
you a part of the most obscene tui-
tion decision in the history of Ameri-

can medical education?

Your presence on the Board
obliges you on some occasions to‘

Snyder,iManson:Howi To , j 
A Bad Name

Give Media

By LARRY LUNSFORD

This column should have run a
week ago so that it could be" more
timely to the issue discussed herein;
however. 1- wanted to wait a week
and read and hear what some other
folks had to say about the subject
before formulating my final opin-
ion.‘ The week’s wait didn’t do much
to temper my'opinion, and I may
have become even more ad'rnant.that

‘ I was. V

The subject is the June l2 telecast
of the Tomorrow Coast to Coast
show on which host..T.om Snyder
interviewed convicted mass mur-
derer Charles Manson. Like thou-
sands of other people. I came home
early thatevening to watch the pro-
gram that had been hyped all week
by both newspapers and NBC.
Never have‘. I witnessed a“ more‘
unprofessional performance by‘ a
journalist (if he can be included in-
that category) than that of Snyder.

iHe certainly has become to televi-

sion whatthe National Enquirer has
become for the print medium.

There is stillsome kindof mys-
tique that surrounds Manson and
his -“family" of followers who were

sentenced to death inil9A7l for the

I969 murders of actress Sharon Tate

and six others. "The sentencesiwere

reduced to life imprisonment in I972

I ‘with the ‘abolition ‘of’ the death

penalty in California."Manson's

‘ interview with Snyder,.-conducted in

a prison parole’ board room. with a
prison guard present, could, have
been an .opportunity for Snyder to iv

take an in-depth. analyticaljlook at _ . ~

the man who scared‘ the hell out of if

‘ the nation inthe late l960's. Most of’

us will never forgetthe picture of
Manson on the cover of Life Maga-9'“

"zine with ’ his. entrancing, almost
. black eyes.gl_ari‘ng at us._‘ ' ‘
’ There ..pr_obably is no doubt in any "

of the viewers’ mindsithat Manson is '

guilty of the crimes; yet, Snyder took _—
- the chance at what appeared to be a

fulﬁllment "of a personal vendetta _g

against Manson. Even at the show’s

conclusion, Snyder_apo|ogi7.ed for. if

his own behavior in the interview,
acknowledging that he had lived in
southern California at the time of

 

the murders and had to explain the. » I

horrible killings to his youngdaugh-i _ .
ter. With the latter fact in mind,-'

 

NBC.should have given the inter-‘ ' if 

view to someone else. Reporters are i _
not and should not be allowed to-"~‘
cover things in which they have a;_
personal stake. Even Walter Cron-';;.
kite was removedfrom the recent
space shuttle coverage by CBS}
because he now sits on the board of 2
, of a national airline ﬁt

directors
carrier.

Snyder antagonized Manson 
from thegstart with his rude andlf
unprofessional manner ofinterview-‘A’

ing. One might think. due to the_

' nature of his_crimes‘,.tl_1at.‘ Manson

isn't due common p.rofessional'cour-,
tesies. but heshould be in this busi?
ness, no matter whathe has done.
. Instead of giving Manson the chanee;
to tell his side of the charges aga'ins_t:
him, Snyder put him on thevdefen.-L
sive-by phrasing his questions lik_
“What does it feel liketo kill.-som",
one‘? Why did you do»it?>Why "did

_ The subject is sports agents. and
as the conversation continues,
Ralph Cindrich becomes more and
more animated.

Cindrich, a Pittsburgh-based
attorney. ex-Pitt Panther and NFL
player, and a sports agent himself
for a stable of athletes that include

ex-Panthers tMark May. Greg-

Meisner and Jerry Boyarsky. dis-
likes the current state of the agent
brotherhood fraught with volumes
of accounts of abuses and poor
representation for the athlete.

To be sure. there are good. reputa-
ble sports agents. and Cindrich is
generally considered one of them.
But the more conspicuous majority
consists offast talkers seeking onlya
fast buck and a fast getaway.

ln a.nutshell, the current problem
with the unregulated proliferation of
sports agents is found in Cindrich’s
short. curt answer to a basic ques-
tion: “What does it take to become a
sports agent?“

“A business card." Cindrich re-

pliesﬂatly.

In an era of complex.multi-year.
multimillion dollar contracts
steeped in legalese and jargon often
peculiar to the sport and the unac-
quainted; with deferred incomes.
investment portfolios. specially-
negotiated clauses and the like. the

men handling a recently drafted ath-
lete‘s contract talks may be no more

qualified for the job than a blind

proofreader.

Currently. sports agents are gov-
erned by no real rules except one
anemic NCAA stipulation and per-
haps their own consciences. a com-
modity often rarer than praying
atheists. There are no requirements.
besides someone to represent and.
preferably. a glib tongue.-There is no
licensing and no governing body
(though both are being proposed)
and no established authority to
examine or penalize an agent for
poor" representation. '

The result is abuses. A lot ofthem.
Especially when the competition
recruiting a prospective client is
intense. and average fees range from
two percent to I2 percent ofthe ath-
lete‘s newly-attained salary.

“So-called agents will make colle-
giate players certain pecuinary
agreements," Cindrich said. “We
heard cases of ladies involved. Cars
involved. Representations are made
(by agents) to college athletes.
whether out of ignorance or decep-
tion. that are simply not true.“

Two examples; tax shelters and
quoting salary figures. “Some will
make representations about the

during the off-season with frequent trips to Pitt’s Trees Hall. '

S,P(.)R.TS 

wtttzma

Promises, Promises...  
Some agents talk but don’t deliver

salary amount the athlete can expect
to receive. Or about benefits by way
of saving taxes. That's ridiculous."
Cindrich said. “There's no way to

guarantee something that isn't nego- ‘

tiated yet, like promising a player
he‘ll be the highest-paid player at his
position."

“It can be a real mess." agrees
attorney Chuck Berry . an associate
of Pittsburgh lawyer-agent Tom
Reich, whose firm represents about
60- pro athletes, mainly baseball
players. “l’ve heard stories of(colle-
giate) athletes being courted from
their freshman year on. I'm sure.
someone like Herschel Walker has
had offers of under-the-table
money. cars; whatever he wants. lt’s
enticing. Especially to someone in
his first or second year ofcollege. It's
definitely a common abuse."

Berry’s assessments seem to echo
many of Cindrich’s laments about
unqualified agents and their
methods.

“lt can be a real rat race. You can
take anybody off the street that
wants to be an agent, and a, lot of
time it just depends on how fast he
can talk." Berr_v said. “lt’s a way to
make a fastbuck, I suppose. and you
get a lot of people doingjust that."

Such representation often
becomes misrepresentation.

Indeed. there are documented

cases of athletes receiving poor‘

counseling from agents and ulti-
.mately. it’s the players themselves
who stiffer the greatest penalties.
And athletes fresh off the campus
aren’t the only ones victimized.
Several years ago. Houston Oilcr
linebacker Robert Brazile. coming
off an All-Pro season. wanted to
renegotiate his contract with the

club. Houston refused and Bra7.ile,>

under the advice of his agent Jerry
Argovitz. the Houston-based
dentist-turned-agent with a pen-
chant for loud-mouthed bravado.
left camp after several days though"
still under contract. '

‘ Undera bylaw in the NFL Consti-
tution. if a player under contract
reports to camp then leaves. seeking
to renegotiate, for example, his team

. automatically enjoys the right totoll

his contract indefinately under its
existing terms. No bargaining lever-
age is gained while pay is lost. as well
asplaying time.

Argovit7. compounded the error

by characteristically running to the
press and bemoaning his clients"

financial plight tojustifythe attempt
for more money.

The ploy only brought closer
scrutiny of Bra7.ile‘s financial status
by his creditors worried about

' repayment.

O11} source. saﬁl one
creditor even attempted to repossess
Bra7.ile’s pickup truck.

Both Berry and Cindrich agree
that tighter regulations. agent regi-
stration and licensing. and estab-
lished guidelines are needed to
improve the rash of unqualified and
unchecked agents seeking a taste of
athletes big contracts.Unlike attor-
nies. who operate under a Canon of
Ethics. other agents can make their
own rules. Cindrich also proposes
bonding agents to ensure athletes
aren’t trying to sue or recover money
from bankrupt men. '

Several states. like California. are
considering required agent registra-
tion and the NFL Players Associa-
tion is working to get regulations for
agents. Currently. the only related-
NCAA rule in the books prohibits
athletes from signing or consulting

,an agent until their last gameis

played. One agent. Thomas M. Col-
lins. has encouraged college coaches
to hold clinics for athletes on how to
deal with agents.

Until something‘ is done. a situa-
tion Cindrich vaguely recalled could
‘become more common. I

Several years ago. an agent (last
name Sorken) appeared at a U.S.
House of Representatives hearing to
explain how he’d lost athletes‘

money and answer charges that he‘d.

ripped off his _clients.
Sorken’s defense: Stupidity.

No Baseball Bad, But No"Stee1ers?
Pitt L o o k s At Football League

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

While the current baseball strike

_ has generated some uproar among

disgruntled Pittsburgh fans. imagine
the wailing and ranting that would
swirlaround town should the NFL
Players Association decide to walk
out before the I982 season.

The players union and the NFL »
. owners must ‘sign a new basic agree-.

ment before I982 play begins and
the major.roadblock to a settlement
will inevitably be the issue of free
agency. just as it is now in baseball.

The big difference is the NFL
players so-called “freedom of move-
merit." another term for a joke.
Under the current contract. it
extends about as far as maverick Al
Davis’ admiration for NFL Com-
missioner Pete Rozellee which is to
say not at all.

NFL players can become free
agents now after playing "out an
option year with a I0 percent salary
hike. but the piratingvteam that signs
them may be required to compen-

.sate the original team with draft
‘choices-—as many as two No. l

picks.

Which explains why a free. agent
like Lynn Swann. who‘s currently
negotiating a new -deal with the
Steelers. has received as many offers
as a wallllower with hallitosis. The
potential is dim.

Pro football players now have . as
a whole. thelowest average salary ‘
of any of the “Big Four" pro sports.
despite laboring forthe richest outfit
going. And th_e NFL will just get

richer next. ‘year. when the league is ‘

expected to sign aibillion dollar tele-
vision contract-— small change when

added to cable and pay television,

one._and likely. a lengthy one. But.
besides the Steeler players, who else
in Pittsburgh stands to benefit most
from a strike?

Pitt football. of course. _

Just as minor league baseball has
enjoyed reviving interest thanks to
baseball‘s strike. Pitt football would
get a boost from the orphaned

Steeler fans that regularly rock‘
Three Rivers Stadium. They'll need A

new affiliations. ‘

The possibility isnot lost on Pitt
athleticadministrators who’ve been
explaining‘ away their recent diffi-

culty filling Pitt Stadium as _“heavy

competition for the entertainment
dollar." Not even Panther teams

‘ contending for national titles nor

promotional price» breaks have
dented the Steeler stronghold in
-Pittsburgh.

. ln i982. quarterback Dan Marino
will be a seniorand a possible pre-
season candidate for the Heisman
Trophy if he has a stunning junior
year. And. he‘ll still be throwing to
Dwight Collins. a bonafide All-
America candidate, behind a team
more seasoned than the untried

, squad Pitt will field this year. Yeah.

a strike in '82 would‘ bejust right for.
Pitt football. ‘ _ '

A home schedule that includes
Notre Dame. West Virginia and
North Carolina shouldn't hurt
either.

Ozanam vs. Philly 

A full day of basketball is slated
for Saturday when three
Philadelphia-area All-Star teams
meet three teams from Pittsburgh's
Ozanam League at Peabody High
School '

The Ozanam I9-and-under team,

including Pitt recruit Chip Watkins V

of Kentucky in his Pittsburgh debut,
will face Philly’s Sonny Hill League
All-Stars in the day’s 7:30 finale.

Preceding that game, the Sonny
Hill Girls team, led by Linda Page
will battlethe Ozanam Girls, includ-
ing Pitt forward Pam Miklasevich,
in a 4:30 contest.

Page is the player who broke Wilt
Chamberlain‘s long standing single-
game scoring record by pouring in
an unbelievable llO points this past
season in a high school game.

At 6 p.m., the Ozanam and Sonny,

Hill l6—and-under teams battle.

Besides the more established Con-
nie Hawkins League, which started
l98l play last week, a new summer
adult league for players I9-and-over
has hit the Pittsburgh courts~-the
Homewood-Brushton League.

The recently-christened league
boasts ll teams and some of the
city’s top talent, including Pitt’s
Darrell Gissendanner. and several
players from the Duquesne Dukes,
past and present. Also expectd to
opt for the-indoor league at last

check were former Central Catholic -

star Marc Marotta, now with Mar-
quette. and ex-Schenley phenom
Bill Varner, now withiNotre Dame.

The Homewood-Brushton
League will play doubleheaders
indoors at the Bennett Street
YMCA. and institute a three-point
shot rule from outside similar to the
NBA‘s version. -

Both leagues are approved by the
NCAA, but players are limited to‘
one league, a rule that sparked com-

enroll in, both leagues first, and

SHOWCASE would like to thank thefol-
lowing people for their invaluable help in
putting out this issue: the typing crew: Gina,
Leslie, and Mark; the paste-up people: Jane
M., Susie, and Jane H.; the proofers: Sandy
and Meg; Mary K. for her concern and many
phone calls; Tracy Potter for allowing herself
to be "roped into doing our cover again-—'you
are most gracious-; Bill Sheer for being, well,
Bill Sheer; ].D.I(. for not deserting ship;
Spanky for putting up with our somewhat
obnoxious behavior at times; and, last but not
least, Frank, Warren, Ron, D.T., and Mike
for being such sweethearts. ' . '

wailing; Richards strutting. Those
guys had power. And think about the
Who. in concert. Guts. Who
remembers Keith's batons? Even old
diehards like the Blue Oyster Cult,
with their millenia megawatt shows
never let the icing overflavor the
cake. But now what do we have? All

icing. And a lot of pretentious garble. -

Just /thinking about Rush's latest
attraction, this year's tour. Silly me; I
almost called it a concert. Or 38 Spe-
cial, or April Wine, or the prostitu-
tion of Styx and REO _(are they new
bands???) or Loverboy, orany of the
‘other pseudo-bands manufactured
by record company execs. Lights, cir-
cuitry, flash; it's all gotten ,a bit too:
tangential. What are the newer bands I
other thansynthesized wires rhyth-
mically plucked before and between
the drum solo and obligatory encore?
Bruce got big; Bruce got commercial;
and now Bruce cannot play for his
real fans in a real theater, even
"though he'd like to. No Stanley this
‘time around. Somebody‘ do
something——the’ State’ of the Art‘ is
falling, of its own weight.... '

The play addresses the clues-
tions of the "military, women's

Up And,Away: ' Superman II’ And The American

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

' If you thought that The Four Seasons
was over-done, The Clash of the Titans
overly-boring, or recent movies, in
general, just took themselves too
seriously, there's a movie that's per-
fect for you —- Superman ll.Actually,
this gem of a picture is perfect forjust
about everyone.

Thoughjnot quite as bizarre as its
predecessor, Superman ll still‘ blazes
with originalitv and eccentricity. For
example, there is a scene where a bill-
board advertisement and a truck——
representing Coke and Marlboro,
respect—ively—explode during a fight-
between ‘good and evil. Each‘ one of
these products represents an every-
day facet of American life which
could be labelled as good or evil,
depending upon your viewpoint.
Another scene is set around a
picture-perfect replica of a truckstop
diner, complete with the local bully
who has forearms like hams. It's
America blown up to bigger-than-life
proportions.

The story is classic comic-book: A
super—human dressed in funny
clothes (why ,do hero—types always
_wear tights?) battles against sinister A
villains for control of the world, and,
at the same time, falls in love with a
beautiful damsel in distress. Cer-

‘History C)f

By I.D. KLEINKE

The tragicor comic thread that
constitutes as successful film's mate-
rial should be of varying color. The
thread of Mel Brooks’ latest film, His— ,
tory of the World, Part I, is all red. One
shade. A" more fitting title for this
obsessive examination of historical
perversion would be the Sexiial History

I of the World, We Know What Parts’.

' Granted, many of us are far from
membership in the Moral Majority;
and there is certainly nothing wrong
with a film exploiting the human —
drama of carnal impropriety. It is vis-

nodding in agreement. a
About this time, Warren enters the
room, trailed by the usual girl or two.
Called ’’the Gary Cooper of rock guit-
arists" in his press release, he
reminds us more of Marlon Brando in

"On The Waterfront. Warren is the
undeniable leader of the band; he

/arranges club — dates, decides" the

I -‘band's repetoire and the order of the

songs, and has a hand in their busi-

.- ness affairs.Before answering any
questions, he dons» a .pair of sun-

glasses, as if to shield himself from
our attack. Onstage, he plays his role
to the hilt, but, here, in this situation,
he's reserved, almost to the point of
being shy. .

A veteran of the Pittsburgh bar
scene, having been a member of Dia-
mond Reo and the Iron City House-
rockers- Warren is not entirely
satisfied with the band's progression.

\"I don't mind being based in Pitts-
burgh, but I'd like to be on the road."
We're trying to break out, to become
a national act. Our records are dis-
tributed around the country but the

band isn't. -I feel we got a semi-raw
deal. We didn't play places where our
record was selling.” he said, reflecting
much the same mood Ron and D.T.
had earlier. ‘

love our audience, it's young and old
-- we get all different types. They've
changed a lot -- they're more recep-
tive to new things, different kinds of
music, I think it's for the better,” he
said ,
Radio has played a good part in get-
ting the bands songs known to Pitts-
burgh audiences. "WDVE gives us a
good amountof airplay,” he said, also
pointing out that their new sing-
le',"Angel of Mercy” is being played
five times a day on that station.
"Nonetheless Warren feels they're

Immediately the bouncers are

- one of the bouncers. Just as they're

about to bodily; throw us out, Mike

Mike doesn't feel the Silencers are

Doing Rock?!

THE PLASTICS & THE FIVE
The Startracker
June 17

By PAM REYNER

The Plastics are an energetic five-
piece band‘ from Tokyo, who play
fast-paced, and very danceable music.
Their music is uniquely their own;
blending‘ elements of Japan andlthe
twin pillars of British/American pop
and ‘rock. Their sound is reminiscent.
of the B—52's deep, throbing rhythms
and quirky singing. They ha_ve a
”technipop" 'orientation,. clearly
reflected in their lyrical as well as
musical content. Their music is crisp
and tight.

Critically acclaimed in their.home-
land, the Plastics performed their
third (but only LP with U.S. release)
album Welcome Back Plastics in its
entirety along with other songs—.
including a cover of The Monkees'
"Last Train to Clarksvillel" The Plas-
tics seem very much interested in the
archives of rock ‘produced in Anglo-
phile countries. The day of the show,
bandmembers were seen in a local
record store in search of Hendrix and
Doors albums.

‘ The Plastics’ trademarklis a tight,
rhythmic music. They employ a
machine instead of a live drummer.
This made the percussion rather
monotonous, save for sporadic per-
cussive accents provided by band-
members‘ with large sticks and
tom-like drums.

A Eminently danceable, the Plastics
are also intellectually listenable.
Chica Sato, attired‘ as an Oriental-
looking gypsy and incorporating ele-
ments of traditional Japanese dance
movements, handled most of the
vocal chores. Principle songwriters
Toshi Nakamishi and Hajime _Tachi—
bana often joined her, the threeof

them singing in tandem. Takemi. *

Shima and Ma-chan Sakuma round
out the band. Some of the songs were '
sung in English, some in Japanese,
and one in French. Particularly note-
worthy was ”Robot". Spouting off 3:
letter initials of corporations and
bureaus (including IBM, TDK, CIA,
CBS)’ _in rapid—fire succession over
brisk up-tempo music‘, the verse ends _
with "...there's no mass media—you're a -

The   . Si lenlcers

. "Warren was playing withthe Tig- _
ers and wanted to form a new band —-_
that's how the Silencers came about.
This is probably the best band I've
ever been in -- I love it,” he said.

Frank somehow manages to swing
the conversation around to roller-
coasters, his favorite subject. "Yeah,
riding rollercoasters is ‘my favorite
thing to do. I used to go to Kenny-
wood a lot and just ride them all day
long.’A'friend of mine used to work
there and one day he let me ride the
Thunderbolt without any brakes -— it"
was great, one of the biggest thrills of
my life. There's nothing like riding
those dips at such an incredible speed.
Coney, Island is ‘even better- —— the
Cyclone is the . best,” 'he said . _

robot." Some of theirother songs are
titled "Good," "Copy," and "Park".
The Five opened I this crowd-
pleasing show with a set of varied
songs. Their music is marked by
sparse, efficient drumming, strong
bass, guitarwork ranging from pick-
/strum to piercing treble riffs, experi-
mentally innovative keyboards, and
garbled vocals. They played well, and
were much more interested in music
dynamics than the Plastics.

BOB—JAMES/GENE DUNLAP
Stanley Theatre
30 May. 1931

BY KEVIN CONNER

Pop/jazz, a dubious title at best, fits
only because it is jazz more than any-'
thing else. On disc, it is usually over-
produced and ends up sounding like
big-budget Muzak. Live, it" is fair to

expect that the compositions would .

be less stilted and methodic. Wrong.
It is a comment on the current state
of pop/jazze that concerts like this
occur. ' This music is best left on
records where it becomes great back-
ground filler for-mellow parties.
Bob James, composer and producer
of pop/jazz, brought his music to the
people, and the question that remains
is why? « '
James’ music seemed to be the
result of computer programming.
Each song had its. obligatory solos,
horn section blares and solid, funky
rhythms. Providing those rhythms
were Dr. Gibbs and Idris Muhammad
(h'ow'd he get _in this band?). Gibbs
had some useful percussion and actu-
ally seemed to be necessary to the

music and Muhammad was good and
loud. * - '

James himself put out some tasty ‘

piano solos, which the crowd would

not quiet down for, otherwise his

playing had that songwriter’s quality V
of being heavily melodic and
repetitous. _ _. _ .
You see, the bad thing was thatthe
‘musicians were good, but the.ma_te—.
rial was too perfect. Even the solos
"seemed planned out. I_ kept expecting‘
"them to punch ‘a time clock whenthey
left the stage before the encore. ‘
One bright spot in an otherwise

V mediocre set was a solo by theguitar

player._ Equipped with a wireless gui-
tar, he proceeded to churn out a wild,
screaming lead while he walked tight-

rope fashion on the divider between

the orchestra pit and the theatre. Not
too many people appreciated it. In the
middle of this mellow set, here's this
guy trying to make it as a guitar hero.

ting the biggest response of the even- i

ing, one has to think that this is
where most of the audience knew"
Bob James from. '

At least Bob James had TV on his
side to get his music across. The
warm—up act, Gene Dunlap, was so
unknown that people could be heard

mumbling to each other, "WhiCh _

one's Gene Dunlap?"

Well, Gene Dunlap is the drummer
and leader of a disco/fusion band
from Detroit. My guess is that they

were a bar band in the Motor City

A -before this. Dunlap was surrounded

by a competent if not downright

"funky band, complete with three

female vocalists. What proved annoy-
ing was their reluctance to do a
totally funky song or a nice jazz
number. They kept mixing the two,
producing a wimpy sound and a low V 3
energy level. '
A’ few more things about the band: .

Dunlap's not-much of a drummer; his I
reed player stuck to his electronic sax

(a lyricon) for all but two peices; and
the vocalists, while strong and'h’ar- .
monic, were boring and superfluous.
The crowd gave their general opinion »
of the band whenthey partied and. »
carried on throughout the entire set. _

seen the tapes we made last
week?

Harvey: (passing the snowy

straight-ahead jazz or our disco-
fied fusion?

Rit: (looking somewhat less
worried) The hot jazzy stuff; I'd
like to get back to that after my
last few albums.

Yeah, I think you should, but

maybe we could limit it to a few
throwaways...Oh my God.

Harvey: (jumping up rather eas-
ily) Son of a beach ball! It musta
been one of the guys who played
the sessions.

Rit: (pacing) Get serious Har-
vey, that's twenty—five guys
we'd have to question.

Harvey: (worrying) Did they
take everything?

Rit: (relaxing slightly) Naw, but
they got all the good music. Oh,
well, no sweat; we'll just make a
good album next time....
Harvey: (sitting back, passing
powder) Say, relax, Lee. Figure
it this way, this music will keep

FACE VALUE
Phil Collins

I always thought that Phil
Collins, lead singer of Genisis
was a good vocalist trapped in a
stagey, affectatious band who
dreamed of singing harmless
cover versions of hit singles in
seedy bars. Well Phil Collins
isn't singing in seedy bars, but
the first solo effort, Face Value is
a delight. A .

Free from the pretensions of

Genisis, Collins is able to culti- ' E

vate his commercial impulses in
catchy three minute‘ songs that
AM radio would ‘love’ to play.‘
With songs as good as "I'Missec_l
Again” and .'_'Thund_'-er and
Lightning" Collins gives a good
name to_ commerci_ality, and
gives you hope that the next
time you're stuck in the dentists
office the radio will be playing
his stuff. "I Missed Again”
makes you feel the ‘way
"Hungry Heart" did.

The just released (Magic,
