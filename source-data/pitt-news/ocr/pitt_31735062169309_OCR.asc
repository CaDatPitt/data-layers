UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Dr. James Liu Delivers

LA Honors Assembly
Address on Red China  

by PAUL STOLLER

Speaking before the Honors Assembly of the School of
Liberal Arts, Dr. James T. C. Liu, associate professor Of‘l1lS-
tory and Oriental studies at Princeton University, predicted
that the Chi-nese Peoples Republic (Red China) will gradual-
ly close its“mi1itaristic aspects and slowly evolve into a cau-
tious and responsible government.

Liu began his keynote address
by expressing his discouragement
about the difficulty in gathering
representative facts about China.
“China remains a mystery to
most of its observers,” remarked
Dr. Liu. He also complained about
the lack of precision involved in
“China Watching.” “In this busi-
ness,” Liu complained, “one is
forced to guess.”

Dr. Liu then proceeded to point
out that Chinese history has been

centered in a well integrated so- .

ciety. “Consequently, revolution
has been a rare occurrence in

Chinese history,” according to,
Professor Liu. Thus, to Dr. Liu,

Chinese society has had govern-
mental systems marked by sta-
bility.

Commenting on the existence
of “Chinese stability,” Dr. Liu
stated that the western interven-
tion of the late 19th century desa-
troyed the integration of Chinese
society. “With the intervention,
China lost her prestige and self-
conﬁdence.” Essentially, then, the
intervention caused “China. to go
to pot.”

Dr.. Liu went on to explain the
great importance of the loss of
the Chinese self-esteem. “The na-
tionalist movement,” according to
Professer Liu, “was an attempt to
reintegrate Chinese society. Un-
fortunately, this attempt was con-

ﬁned to the cities and was sub- ~

ject to corruption and ultimate
failure.” .

In Dr. Liu’s view, a basic cause
for the success of the Chinese
Communists was the post war
desire for reintegration and pres-
tige. “In ’1949, the Communists
represented a “new. hope” to the
people of China.” At ﬁrst in Dr.
Liu’s opinion, the Chinese Com-
munists were moderately success-
ful in reintegrating. and reor-
ganizing the Chinese society. “But
with the advent of increased to-
talitarian controls, the Commun-
ists ran into successive prob-
lems.” Dr. Lieu substantiated his
point by citing existing Chinese
problems. These included the
problems of lagging production,
famine, and population increase.
Liu also stated that the “heroic
great leap forward—-the geat
economics push——did not go far-
ward—it fell.”

Shifting to the current situa-
tion, Dr. Liu explained that “the
future of China is not bright be-
cause the Chinese ﬁnd them-

selves in a. bind between the
United States and the Soviet
Union.” This current situation,‘ in
Liu’s view, has caused two phe-
nomena: a discontent among the
adolescent -elements _of the Chi-
nese society and a feeling of hos-
tility towards the minority ele-
ment of the Chinese Communist-

’ Party.

-“In order” to deal with Pheno
nomena," stated Dr. Liu, “Mao in-
stituted the Proleterian Cultural
Revolution. The aim of the rev-
olution is to purge the party of
its unfaithfuls.”

Liu also stated that he be-
lieved, “No civil war has really
developed in China. Today's cris-
is,” according to Liu, “is another
test of Chinese reintegration.”

Dr. Liu concluded, “If China
eliminates its current problems,
there will be less stress placed
upon Chinese military technolo-
gy. Thus, “there would be the
China.”

Council Chooses Officers; i 
Role of Group Questioned

DAVID EHRENWERTH
M en's Council President

by DAN BOOKER
With its new constitution
temporarily approved by the
Student Government Com-
mittee on Student Organiza-

.tions, Men’s Council (MC)

elected four officers Tuesday
night. The top three men
elected are the same as those
refused office three Weeks-
ago by a decision of the Dean
of Men’s office. _ —

t The earlier refusal of office
came after members of the Coun-

Apartheid Rejected

cil complained that the group’s

new constitution had not been .

approved by the University Rec-
ognition’s Committee. Thus, of-
ﬁcers could not be elected under
its provisions. Under standard
procedures, changes in the consti-
tutional structure of campus
groups must be approved by this
committee. The Recognitions Com-
mittee disbanded at just this
time and was replaced by the
SG committee.

Dave Ehrenwerth, LA sopho-
more, will be president of the
group at least until September,
when a decision will be made
concerning when the Council will
hold University-wide elections.
Ehrenwerth himself did not close
the door on fall elections, but he‘
stated that February elections

___r_night be more favorable.
“Putting this back to February,

would give MC a chance to be-
come known enough so that peo-
ple would run for election to the
group,” he commented.

The Committee on Student Or-
ganizations had recommended
that the Council open itself to
University - wide elections. The
Council was granted temporary
recognition until Oct. 2 of this
year, when speciﬁc proposals
concerning elections and clariﬁ-
cations of the group’s powers
must be included in its constitu-
tion and submitted to the SG

WUS Urges Free Education

The organization of World
University Service (WUS)
was established at the close
of World War II to aid coun-
tries of the world establish
adequate educational facili-
ties. Among its many projects is
the South African Committee for
Higher Education (SACHED), in

- the Republic of South Africa.

The government of South Af-
rica, in 1959, introduced the apar-
theid principle into South Afri-‘
can universities by legislation.
Black African students were thus
effectively restricted to inferior
tribal colleges. -

In response to the apartheid
legislation, the National Union of
South African Students (NUSAS)
called a meeting of student lead-_
ers from all over South Africa.

Refusingto submit to the unjust‘

racial policies of the white pow-
er structure, these student lead-
ers decided on a plan to main-
tain some free and independent
higher education. NUSAS, assist-
ed by many prominent educators
in South Africa, set up the South
African Committee for Higher
Education (SACHED).

‘The purpose of SACHED has
been to improve the quality of
higher education for the South
Africans. Because of the circum-
stances in the country and in the
universities this purpose meant
that SACHED would provide and
educational alternative to the

A apartheid universities _and col-
\ leges of South

tutorials for the student. toward _

a correspondence degree from
the University of London. Under
this program students who want
an adequate education can obtain
it without leaving the country. ‘

The trustees of SACHED ap-
pealed to the international stu-
dent and university community
for funds to set up SACHED. The’
WUS and the International Stu-
dent Conference are continuing

» to do all in their power toipro-

vide the necessary funds to‘ keep
SACHED going. .

Since SACHED started, a total
‘of 134 students have been ac-
cepted. Several of these students
have successfully progressed to
the B.A. and B.Sc. level and many
of them are now studying in
overseas universities.

SACHED is not a static body;
it is a developing one. Many

improvements in courses, books,
and in the organization itself
have been introduced since 1960'.
SACHED relies on the assistance
it receives from WUS. If further
improvements are to be made,
the student ngrnbers are to be
increased, more funds will be
required. ‘

To aid -this program WUS will
sponsor a fund drive on campus
March 20-23. Three hundreds dol-
lars alone will provide a non-
white South African with one
year's education.

Contributions may be made the =

week of the drive at tables in
the Towers, Cathedral of Leam-
‘ing and Student Union. Checks,
made out to the World Universi-
ty Service, may -be sent to the

committee for review.

The question of what the pow- ‘R

ers and duties of MC actually
are even led members of the or-
ganization to question whether
the organization should continue

toexist. Ken Adler, a member of 7

the Council, said, “Unless we can

do more pertaining to men —- 1,

schedule something like profes-
sional men speaking on careers
or a draft program—there is no
use for the organization.”

Adler .. volunteered that the«--

men’s host program for Freshmen

Orientation of the transfer pro- .-

gram could probably be handled
by SG. These are current major
functions of MC, along with the
Activities Fair and Freshman
Camp. “Throughout the year,’.’
commented Adler, “we have been

‘sitting at meetings and the same H
thing always came up—what are _ A '

We going to do?”  ..-

Ehrenwerth explained that the
Council was planning expansion
of its programming but that .this
was only one of “two levels” it

should handle. He described the '
second ‘level as one of ‘frepre- 
senting all the men and taking “
stands on issues affecting all the .
men.” He used the draft and dis-

crimination in off-campus ‘hous-l

ing as examples. .

On this subject, Adler remark-
ed, “For an organization that
does nothing, it is ridiculous to
take a stand on controversial is-
sues.” " —

“Over the last six years,” re
marked Council member Maris
Ravenscraft, “it (MC) has com;
to the verge of death.” He still
maintained, however, that “the
potential is there.” Group guid-

ance Dl‘08'l’ams for freshmen and  .

support of the Men’s Emergency

Loan Fund were areas he felt

the Council could‘ explore. .
Ravenscraft admitted that the
Council could speak out on is-

sues affecting the University com-it

munity only if it were “truly

representative and could offer "
some constructive criticism.”

Ehrenwerth emphasized that he
wanted the campus-wide elec-
tions to be structured so that
the Council would actually be

representative of all University I

men. He suggested some sort of
quota system in selection of mem-
bers that would allow for repre-

sentation of all classes, of Greeks ’ I
and non-Greeks, and of dorm it

Dutch Theologian Discusses

by HARRY TUMINELLO
Father Frans VanDooren,
Dutch theologian, spoke be-
fore a group of ‘University
students last Tuesday after-
noon on recent developments

in the Dutch Catholic Church.
Surveying these developments,

 Father VanDooren commented,
,“What I have found is neither

clear nor coherent.” Father Van-
Dooren went on to discuss the
developments which have drawn
applause by some and violent de-
nunciation by others.

Holland’s unique position at
the crossroads of Europe, her
small size and her dense popula-
tion combine to create the en-
vironment in which Dutch Cath-
olics, Protestants and non-Chris-
tians have begun to seek mean-
ingful dialogue and serious co-
operation, Van Dooren observed.
The Dutch Catholic Church or-
ganized the Dutch Pastoral Coun-
oil in November -of 1966 to pro-

1 vide for the organization of Cath-

olic laity and clergy and also

, Protestants and non- Christians,

even communists.
Father VanDooren explained

A. the of the Council in terms

of a search for concrete action
to implement ecurninism in Hol-
land. The movement in the Dutch
and wine are consmned as a
Church, he explained, is essen-
tially an attempt to deal with
“man in our time,” to make reli-
gion relevant to the whole ' so-
ciety, not just one small group.
As Father VanDooren pointed

out, “each church is incomplete
in itself.” -

“In the spirit of the Vatican
Council, movement in Holland
towards mutual participation in
religious services has begun. One
avant-garde group has even 
tiated an ecumenical meal, the
Lord’s Supper, in which bread
celebration of the Eucharistic
feast,” VanDooren continued. “Al-
though unusually advanced, this
group is not an unexpected out-

growth of the new Spirit and
unity of the Dutch churches.”
Touching upon the question of
the possible hostile response, of
Rome to the actions of the Dutch
bishops, Father VanDooren stated
that he couldn’t really answer
the question of ‘whether the Dutch
Church was verging on heresy.
He did feel, however, that the
movement was laudable and that
the response of Rome had been,
at least to the present, favorable.

During World War II, he served
with the 83rd and 75th Infantry
Divisions. In the latter, he was

Student Protest Powerlessness

Middlebury Dissolves SG

MIDDLEBURY, Vt. (CPS)
——In a protest against power-
lessness, the students of Mid-
dlebury College have voted to
dissolve their student gov-
ernment.

A campus referendum on the
issue saw the Middlebury Stu-
dent Association abolished by a
407-70 tally. Student Association
President John Rogers said he
“had expected that
vote.”

Rogers said he considered the

referendum results “a positive
act, calling for a redeﬁnition of
the whole concept of student gov-

- ernment at Middlebury.”

The editor of the school paper,’
The Middlebury Campus, stated
that the referendum came about
because the Student _Association

 

sort of a,

“felt it had no tangible powers.”

Campus Editor Jeffrey. Dwork-
in said that the governing body
had been limited to determining
the distribution of student activ-
ities fees, and that even this pro-
cess involved possible veto by
the school’s director of student
activities.

According to Dworkin, the NIid-
dlebury administration is consi-

dering holding an election to re-
constitute a student governing
group. Meanwhile, the Freshman
Class Council is contemplating
self-dissolution because of its lack
of power. ‘

Middlebury Dean of Men Den-
nis O'Brien said he considered
the referendum -a “neutral act”
which “can be interpreted in
many different ways.”

BYU Rocked
By Spy Rings
Investigation

PROVO, Utah (CPS)—Brigham
Young University (BYU) is in the
calm of a hurricane’s eye after
being rocked by student charges
of an administration-instigated
student spy ring. ‘

Two BYU political sicence stu-
dents described the “spy ring” to
the school’s student body during
a university “free forum." The
students, Ronald Hankin and Col-
leen Stone, claim they were ask-
ed by a political science profes-
sor to “check up” on faculty’ 1'8’-

action to a speech by BYU Presi-
dent Ernest Wilkinson, made last
April 21.

Wilkinson’s address was des-
cribed as “a conservative View
of totalitarianism, federal aid,
capitalism, and socialism.” Ac-
cording to Hankin, 15 students
were offered the “spy tas ”
which was reportedly authorized
by BYU Vice-president Joseph T.
Bentley. The students were to
report on the reactions of eight
teachers who are of “liberal, left-
ist leanings,” Hankin stated.

BYU’s chapter" of the American
Association of University Profes-
sors (AAUP) has asked the

school’s Board of Trustees to in- -

vestigate the allegations. Univer-
sity Presildent Wilkinson said the
students were “misinformed” and
that he had no knowledge of the
spy ring.

I-Iankin charged that six of the
eight professors were forced to
resign from the faculty of the
Mormon school for political rea-
sons. The student said that fol-
lowing the Wilkinson speech, he
had “recriminations and realized
what was wrong.” A former John
Birch Society member, Hankins
said he then “began passing infor-
mation from both sides around.”

.. The official University statement issued to clarify Auxiliary Enter-
gprises Director John C. Langstaff’s ownership of Your Campus Store falls
“far short of its intention. Rather than clearing up.the disputed points, it
fails to produce sound evidence that a conflict of interest does not exist
 Langstaff’s dual capacity as owner of Y0
of the University Book Center. - _
, The statement applauds Langstaff’s declaration that “there is abso-
lutely no relationship between the two” positions, yet there is no comment
- on his reply “that is my private life and has no relationship with Pitt or
[my jo ,” in answer to whether or not he owns Your Campus Store.

, I » If Langstaff refuses to comment on a supposedly well-known fact, how
I-jmtuch credance does the official University stand that La.ngstaff’s associa-

students may purchase items‘ such as those carried by Your Campus School

only one letter protesting his
policy? Why has there been
a lack of representative stu-
dent protest?

The answer to these ques-

. tions is a simple one. His stu-

dents feelthat they are
ﬁghting .a lost cause. First,
the professor’s attitude to-
ward student needs is a
closed one. Any professor
who has the gall to schedule

-unannounced major examin-

ations must not really consi-
der student needs or prob-

,lems. . -
But more appalling than
- Dr. Aghassy’s apparent

closed mind toward the stu-
dent, is his explanation of
his ‘exam policy. It seems as
if Dr. Aghassy is engaging
in child’s play by giving
subtle hints concerning when
his unanounced exams
would be ‘given. If Dr. Ag-
hassy can resort to giving
“helpful hints” why‘can’t he
simply announce his exams?

5 The‘ mere fact that Aghassy

has resorted to giving hints
indicates, to me, that he tru-
ly believes that his exam-

intionpolicy is, indeed wrong—

and unjust. But, I also be-
lieve that Dr. Aghassy, with
all due respect, simply does-
n’t want to admit that he is
mistaken about his examin-

‘ ation policy.

sales. Assistant to the Vice-Chancellor of Finance David M. Smith stated
as much. “These items (bearing the Pitt seal) carry a substantially larger
mark-up than textbooks. There is no reason why we shouldn’t carry them.”

The‘ University did carry such items, as mugs and glassware until a
few years ago, when, according to the manager of Your Campus Store, “my
boss (Langstaff) picked (the line) up. We bought out what the Book-
store had——they didn’t want to handle this line of merchandise any more.”

However, the University official ttatement only proclaims, “Your
Campus Store has never purchased any discontinued or surplus items from
the Book Center,” and fails to answer whether or not the merchandise
was taken -on. .

The statements leave doubt in the students’ mind as to the real state

By permitting» Langstaff to serve as Director of Auxiliary Enter-

prises and also own Your Campus Store, the University places itself in a

vulnerable position. The very idea that the twofoperations are competitive
in their nature, regardless of how they so designate themselves, gives rise
to serious questions of a real conflict of interest. '

We are not doubting the personal integrity of any of the individuals

involved. However, we do feel that the very fact that Langstaff’s dual

hassy’s unannounced major
exam policy? To this date
there have been two exam-
inations given in Aghassy’s
Geography 81 class.

ination, ,a good friend of
mind, who has a 3.17 QPA
received a numerical grade
which was equivalent to a
“B.” On the unannounced
exam, however, my friend
who is by all means a com-
petent student received a
numerical grade which could
be equated with an “F.” Why
did my friend suffer such a
drastic drop in grades ?

Dr. Aghassy might ans-
wer this question by stating
that the student in question
did not study his material.
Or. he might add that the
student concerned simply
was not listening to one of
his helpful hints..

, These specious answers
don’t really answer the ques-
tion. The simple answer is,
Dr. Aghassy, that not many
students, no matter how in-
telligent they are, can be ex-
pected to perform well on
an unannounced major ex-
amination.

DR. AGHASSY may or_

may not be the only profes-
sor at the University who
schedules ‘unannounced ma-

‘ j or exams at the University.

But this is not the point. The
point is that no University
professor should be permit-
ted to schedule unannounced
exams. I believe that profes-
sors who schedule the unan-
nounced exam should be cen-
sured by either the chair-
man of the respective de-
partment or the administra-
‘tion itself.

Dr. Aghassy, respect is a
wonderful thing, and I think
that if you rescinded your
present_policy of unannounc-
ed‘ examination, you would

_earn the earnest respect of ‘P

your students. Courage, my

capacities can be interpreted as unethical by some necessities that the
University take immediate action to satisfactorily resolve a most unsatis-
factory situation.

VVho Is Really Guilty?

PEOPLE MAY argue un-

-- til they are hoarse that the

United States Government
has no right to force a man
to ﬁght in a war in which he
d-oes not believe. Their argu-

- ments come to nothing be-

cause they cannot produce a
better system to back up our
nation's committments. Con-
sidering the present world
situation, conscription is a
fact of life, and only the po-
litically naive would deny it.
The real issue concerning the
President’s proposed draft
law is not the draft itself,
but how it is to be instru-
mented.

I believe that the John-
son Administration, with'its
emphasis on clean highways
and our Great Society, has
consistently ignored the
needs of America’s greatest
asset—its college commun-
ities. Tw_o instances serve as
proof. ‘

In September, 1965, col- A

lege communities across the
nation were shocked when,
t-o their surprise, they read
that President Johnson had
decided to phase out Nation-
al Defense Education Act
loans. Only when Congress
responded with uproaring in-
dignation did the President
back down.

IN JUNE,-1967, the pres-
ent Selective Service Act ex-
pires and President Johnson
plans to railroad through

Congress a new draft law

that would not only deny all
graduate students, except
medical and dental aspirants,
deferments, but would also
leave in doubt the fate
of male students now in col-
lege. Johnson declinded to

by Lewis M. Taffer

commit himself on under-
graduate deferments and is
letting Congress iron out
that aspect of the problem
on its own.

While it is true that the
proposed system would drain

mainly from a pool of 19-’

year-olds, the law student
or masters candidate would

~ have an axe perpetually loom-

ing above his neck. No grad-
uate student could be ex-
pected to have his graduate
study interrupted for a two
year stint in rice paddies and
then continue with his work
unaffected.

It is high time that the
Johnson regime looked in the
correct direction and stop-
ped barbecueing America’s
future leaders -— her college
youth. It is totally ludicrous
when a local draft board con-
siders a college student and
one ofPresident’ Johnson’s
highway cleaners on the
same plane.

PRESIDENT J OHNSON’S
select committees have hur-
led invectives at graduate
students labelling them eve-
rything from “stallers” to
“draft-dodgers.” Colege stu-
dents who wish to pursue
further studies should not
feel guilty for their sincere
interest in knowledge.

_When the facts are stu-
died,_ the inevitable conclu-
_sion_ is that college America
is, in actuality, an elite. It
should be treated according-
ly. The university should be
sacred ground when consi-
dering those students .who
are in it. The college campus
must forever remain in the
interest of the national fu-
ture, a demilitarized zone.

Profs Differ with

Editorial on Draft
Editor, The Pitt News:

Your editorial, “The Fishbowl

Folly,” will surely arouse many
sentiments, pro and con. We count

ourselves ﬁrmly on the side of

those who support the policy
recommended by the President’s
advisory commission.

A lottery, and the eﬁding of
educational and occupational de-
ferments, should have this desir-
able consequence, among others.
It will involve very many young
men, and their parents, who up
to now have been sheltered from
the war and its personal mean-
ing; It will no longer be a war
fought mainly by the less edu-
cated, the little! skilled, and those
who‘ opt for careers in the oiTi-

cer corps. .When it becomes ap-

parent that. this is a war which
will draw its troops from all
strata in society, perhaps it will
no longer be so easy for so many
to absorb the propaganda in fav-
or of escalation uncritically. We
may yet see that reasoned nation-

al debate over the Johnson poli-
cy which Senator Fulbright and
a few others have tried "to ini-
tiate.

Editor, The Pitt News:

.It is diﬁicult to follow the log-

ic expressed in the editorial “The
Fishbowl liolly” (March 6), the
author of which presumably con-
siders himself a staunch believer
in democracy. After all, he sup-
ports a system which would
draft all men at a given age. Yet
he can, at the same‘ time, con.-
demn a national lottery because
“then one’s position in our so-
ciety would become meaningless.”
Exactly! Who's to say whose con-
tributions to the nation are more
important.

Conceivably during wartime a

steelworker would be of greater _
economic value to the nation than V

Protests
Controls

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (CPS)——Stu-
dents at the University of Illi-
nois have been staging massive
demonstrations for the past week
to protest the state legislature’s
control over student organizations
at the school.

The protests center around the
1947 Clabaugh Act which prohi-

bits ‘the university from extend-
ing “to any subersive, seditious,

and un-American organization” »

the use of university facilities.
The bill was originally intend-

ed to dou-se the activities of the

Communist - inﬂuenced American

Youth for Democracy, which died 0

within two years of the bill's
passage. Other student groups,
most recently‘ the DuBois Club,
have come under the Act's pres-
sure when applying to establish
an organization on the Illinois
campus.

Student protests were origina.l- .

ly organized by the campus chap-
ter of Students for Democratic
Society (SDS). However, the Stu-
dent Senate, the Interfraternity
Council and many faculty mem-
bers have endorsed the campaign.

University President David
Dodds Henry had made no state-
ment on the issue except to pro-
pose that school officials meet
with 20 students protesting the

Marshall McLuhan is slowly
emerging as the best bet among
contemporary scholars to be rank-

20th century. This is rather sur-
prising because anyone reading
his Understanding Media would
swear that he couldn’t pass a
freshman English course. , —
One of his critics calls his

. '- books “horrendously difficult to-
« read—clumsily written, frequent-

ly contradictory, oddly organ-
ized, and overlaid with the au-
thor’s singular jargon.” Other

, I ~ commentators say he isn’t even

original. Why, then, has he re-
ceived such praise?

like his other books, this one is
readable. In fact, the book con-

tains more pictures, designs, and”

cartoons than words. V
His basic theme is that the
media are reshaping every as-
pect of our lives. He has a rather
interesting theory of history: “So—
cieties have always been shaped
more by the nature of the media
by which men communicate than
by the content of the communica-
tion.” "Thus we have three ages
of man: the Pre-literate or Tribal,
the Gutenberg of Individual, and

the present Electric Retribalized.

In the Tribal Age, before writ-
ing was invented, “man lived in
acoustic space: boundless, direc-
tioness, horizonless, in the dark
of the mind, in the world of emo-
tion, by primordial intuition, by
terror. Speech is a social chart
of this bog.”

Gutenberg’s invention of the
printing press forced man to com-
prehend in a linear, uniform,

» connected, continuous fashion. A

whole new environment — the
Gutenberg Galaxy—emerged. For

the 'ﬁrst time, man could read
and think in isolation. Individ-
ualism, was born.

The new age began with the
invention of the telegraph. In-
stantaneous communications was

possible. R e c e n t developments

like radio and TV have further-
ed this process to the extent that
we are continuously involved
with the entire world. Detach-
ment and individualism are more
difficult, if not impossible. We
are becoming on-e Tribal Village
again.

With the aid of Fiore, a talent- —

ed graphics art designer, McLu-
han effectively uses his medium
to let the reader‘ know the im-
portance of the media. Pictures
include a raw egg with a trade-
mark printed on it, the torso of
a women without clothes (you
see, clothes are the medium, and
hence the message comes across
better without them), Amherst
seniors walking out of a gradua-

tion address by "McNamara, and - -

a close up of.a pair of ﬁsh-net
stockings.

FIVE QUARTERBACKS SAND BILL NELSON

 

I Standing on the 20 yardline, partially hidden by an at- I

tentive circleof Panther quarterbacks, Bill Nelson treads on
the familiar turf of Pitt Stadium in an unfamiliar role.

Shortly, the conference breaks up, and the ﬁve quarter-
back hopefuls begin .to practice what Nelson has just ex-
plained. The Pittsburgh Steeler signal caller has been asked
by coach Dave Hart to instruct the ﬁve during spring prac-
tice. . —

Hart realizes that in the group of four sophomores an-d
one senior rides his hope for next season. He wants them to
get all the attention possible. That’s where Nelson comes in.

“They lack an offensive backfield coach,” says Bill. “So .

while coach Hart is personally handling the other backs, he
wants me to watch the quarterbacks.”

On the field, Nelson contrasts startingly to Hart and
his other assistants. _ .

When sophomore ‘Chuck Winters had trouble hanging
on to the ball after the snap from center, Nelson patiently
explained, “I -don’t yell and scream. I’m not in a position -to.
But coach Hart will. Make sure you have the ball before
you drop back to pass.” He tells -George Medick and Jeff
Barr the same thing. . ‘

Nelson offers constructive criticism to each of his quar-
terbacks. And since he’s Bill Nelson, theylisten. “I’m relat-
ing what I’ve been taught to them,” he says. “The four
sophomores have picked up different habits in high school-
things like taking the snap — and it’s_. hard‘ for them to
change. .

“Their execution, their movements interest me. And I

guess because I play pro ball,
they connect what I tell them
with my job.” .

One point that Nelson has
been stressing this week is
the delivery of the ball. “Set
and throw, set and throw,”
he reiterates.

Often Bill demonstrates
the correct procedure, then’
steps aside to let his pupils
work on it. , ‘ S “

They -usually learn fast.
“Good shot, Frank; just a
little late,”'he points out to
sophomore Frank Gustine.

The quarterback candi-
dates aren't immune to
tongue lashings, however. In
his own relaxed way, Nelson
commands their attention
and respect. ‘

On one occasion, he ad-
addressed one of the sopho-
mores who found another
part of the ﬁeld more inter. , ‘ , '
esting. “Listen, I don’t enjoy BILL NELSON .
being out here,” he snapped. Lendinaan Experienced Hand
“I’d rather be playing golf.” He didn*t have to repeat him-
self. s

Nelson’s task is not to rate the five and tell Hart who’s
the best quarterback. “The movies will show that,” Bill says.
“I’ll say this, though. They all have fine arms.”

~Hart does want Nelsonto teach them throwing tech-

nique. “We set him alone with the five of them,” Hart ex-_

plains, “just for that reason.” Then Hart moved his arm
across and down like a crossfire pitcher in baseball, and
smiled, “even though he throws sidearm sometimes.”
Nelson is familiar with Harts’ system “-I” and pro set sys-
tem, having played out of the same‘ formations at Southern
California. “I have a lot of conﬁdence in it,” he says. “It

' was good to me as a quarterback and it got our team into

the Rose Bowl. \, .

“Right now,” he admits, “the kids are nervous. They’re
all trying to look good. Bob Bazylak is the only one who's
calm out there, but that’s only because he’s played in a
game situation.” ’ ' _

Their desire to do well is obvious. Nelson cites an ex-
ample of how it shows up. “If we’re concentrating on sprint-
ing out and coordinating footsteps with the throw, and if
their pass is a bad one, they’ll go back to their old ways to
make a better throw. _ - -

“But ‘that’s the purpose of spring practice,” he notes,

, “to work and correct and_ work some more.”

_ ’ Hart offers another reason in Nelson’s case. “He’d like
to.,c'o_ach. som

By ROY JACOBS
Tuesday was a big day for Jim Flanigan. ‘
There he was ‘sitting in his room, leafing
-through a book, when -he got a call from the
head coach of the world’s best football -

team. -

Vince Lombardi had called Flanigan to tell him
he was the second round draft choice of the Green
Bay Packers of the National Football League.

“I was sort of stunned,” said Flanigan, “but I
was very excited. It’s great to go to a winner, and
the Packers are first class all the way.”

Jim »was well aware that the NFL and the
Am.er.ican Football League were having their com-
bined draft of college talent Tuesday because he
had been contacted by every team except the Phila-
delphia Eagles. and he had expected to be drafted.

“St. Louis sounded real interested, but then they
traded for..Jerry.Hildebrand.” Flanigan expected to
be taken by either the Baltimore Colts or Cleve-
land Browns after the Cardinals lost interest. That’s
why‘ the Packers were such'a surprise.

“They don’t really need linebackers that badly,
while some of the other teams do,” Flanigan rea-
soned. “They’ve got Leroy Caffey and Dave Robin-
son. Of course, Ray Nietzsche’s getting old.

“Green Bay always looks forward. Like this I‘

Flanigan’s been getting himself ready to “get in_
there” by working out six days a week. Last sea-
son he played at 218 pounds. He’s already built,
himself up to "237. He’ll stay there if the Packers

Before Flanig'an' does anything else, there arb-
several other matters, including contract, to iron
out. Green Bay assistant Bob Sheltenburg will be

Jim’ll be a little more settled.

The first he heard from Green Bay was a tele-
gram last Saturday night explaining their interest
“ in him. The next thing was Lombardi’s call Tues-A

day. His mind was blank after that. 
“Then I realized‘I was drafted by the champs_..
They pay well and there’s championship money.
And they’ve got a football town.” ,  '

And now Flanigan’s set. He’ll have a lot more .-
big days, but he’ll be reading offenses, not books.

"Dave Hart dipped into one
of the nation’s top refineries

of high school football play-A

ers, Bordentown Prep in New
Jersey. And he pulled out four
more recruits for the 1967 fresh-
man team. It brought to 24 the:
number of players who enroll
next fall.

In Hart’s relentless recruiting
program, many scholastic players
will be turned down. Some be-
cause of academic requirements,_
but others because of the schol-
-arship quota allowed. to football.

“You hurt feelings,” Hart noted.
“But you hate to put off other
kids if one boy can't choose his
college.”

Charles Hall, a 6-1, 200 pound
halfback from Lower Marion High
in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., is the plum
of Hart's pickings from Borden-
town, a collegiate scout campout.
This past year, he lead Borden-

Under Bobby Lewis, base-
7. ball at the University has
: seemed to be on a perpetual

 - merry- go-round. One year

-i: the mitters rise and have a
big season, and the next_ 3788!‘
they sink and_ have a mediocre
one.

Last year was one of the team’s
mediocre seasons as they posted
an ‘8-10 record. And this 3793!‘
Lewis is looking for a big win-
ner as he had in 1959, 1961, 1963,‘
x and 1965: V .

‘ “I don’t know what it is,” re-
marked Lewis in explaining his
to ‘teams up and down tendencies.
"" “We seem to build up a team to
E’ a point and then they all grad-
. uate at once. Last year we _had
a down year, but we "used mostly
sophomores and juniors and
they’reall back. I‘ look for a big
season this time.“

Lewis has more than tradition.

as a reason for optimism. Re-
turning from_ the 1966 squad are
the top six hitters and the top

_' '  of hurlers. “But we lose al-

.. 7 ‘most all of them again next year.”
’ Tsaid Lewis, thinking again of the

merry-go-round.

The inﬁeld, according to Lewis,
is the team’s strongest point. Re-
tumees include third baseman
and captain Tom Beckett, short-
I stop Steve Kienzl and ﬁrst base»
.‘ man Chris Mitchell. However,
" ‘new players and graduating old
___ones have forced Lewis to make
some shifts. _

One newcomer is Kenny Cook,
.and the 6’2” junior has forced

CHRIS MITCHELL is shown making a putout in last year's win over‘

 

ig Season

  

 

Allegheny. One of three returning infielders, Mitchell is being tested
‘ at catcher to try to add some punch at that position.

Kienzl to shift from shortto sec-
ond. “Kenny’s a tall boy and he’s
got more range,”‘Lewis said. “Be-
sides, he’s got a riﬂe for an arm.

“Steve’s making the adjustment
‘real well. He has 'a real good
pivot on the double play and. he
has a good arm.”

The other move is a possible
shift of Mitchell to catcher.
“Catching is up. in the air pow,”
explained Lewis. “Mitchell caught
a little in high school. If he can
do the job, we can use-Tommy
Smith at ﬁrst and add to our at-
tack.” .

Smith, a junior, was used in
spots last year and impressed
Lewis with his hitting. ,“He gets
a piece of the ball every ,_time
and he ﬁelds very well.”,

; Kienzl and Mitchell both bat-
ted better than .300 last season,

and Lewis expects them to im- '

prove this year. He also expects
big things from Beckett who
slumped to .246 after hitting .313
as a sophomore.

“Tom’s a much better hitter
than his average. He’s going to
bounce back. It’s very easy to
slump in a short season like we
have, but he’s too good a hitter
to let it happen twice.”

In the outﬁeld, Lewis will make
a departure from his past strate-
gy of platooning. “This year I’m
going to ﬁnd the three best hit-
ting-wise and ﬁelding-wise ‘and
play them. In a short season_a
fella doesn’t get a chanceto get

,.set if he platoons. The leading

candidates are lettermen Phil

Nasrallah, George McKenzie, Tom

Stickel and Warren Sordill.
Lewis will rely on two letter-

-men to handle the brtmt of the

pitching chores. “Stock’s going to
have to be our Drysdale and Wel-
ty’s going to have to our Kon-
fax,” he said. i

Right-hander Don Stock was
1-1 last year with a 0.82 ERA.
Lefty Dave Welty was _3-4 and
his ERA "was 2.95. “Both are
working hard, learning how to be
our stoppers. They’re both ac-
complished; they don’t beat them-
selves. We’re really counting on
them.”

Then Lewis said, “I can’t see
how we can help being better
than last year.” The merry-go-
round seems on the way up.

(Continued from Page 9_)
fusing to the players, but the
coaching staff did not have the
chance to get a good look at each
individual.

“This year with all these siopho-'
mores, we had to ﬁnd out where
each one can play,” said Hart.

“Now with this longer period
of exposure, a coach will get a.
good look at a player,” Hart said.
“We can concentrate our efforts.
We can get a concentrated eval-
uation of each player.”

“Then we’ll be able to answer,
‘Can he play offense? _Can he
play ‘ defense?”’ he said."

Hart already realizes where
players like Ed Whittaker, Bob
Longo, Dave Drake, and Greg
Keller are best. He is not ‘sure

  

  H... “swaps” 1>1aye.4s   

about some of the sophomores,
however. 6

With the luxury of a 68 man
squad this Year, compared to 59
in 1966, Hart plans yet another
change. He is going all-out for
scrimmages.

Keller, a defensive end last
year, is listed for Jim Flanigan’s'
former spot at defensive middle
linebacker. Whittaker, who saw
the most of his action on offense
as a soph, is being tried at de-
fensive tackle. '

Although it’s still too early to
tell, Hart has set-up a depth
chart. And he is experimenting
with sophs, and also with vets.

Art Alois, a defensive lineback-
er last year, so far is slated as
first string offensive tight guard-.
