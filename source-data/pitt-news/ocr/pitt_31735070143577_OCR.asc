Correction

In Dan Vetanovetz's article,
"Union to get Spa Treat-
ment," published last
week, Jumpstart's office
location was incorrectly re-
ported. The organization's
office has always been
located on the 9th floor of
the \M||iam Pitt Union. The
Pitt News regrets the error.

CAMMIQN RHETORIC OF JULY. 2009-

: snu. WANT   .

Tracking sex offenders

Auditor General proposes use of GPS bracelets

I snu. WANT , I STILL NEED

Pennsylvania Auditor Gen-
eral Jack Wagner is pushing
the state to consider a law that
would ‘require all convicted
sex offenders in Pennsylvania
to wear GPS ankle bracelets so
that their location can be mon-
itored at all times for up to five
years after they are released

from prison. Backed by sev-

eral officials in the legislature,

; the law is aimed at discourag-

E ing “noncompliant” offenders
 that the state cannot locate.

According to The Pitts-

 burgh Post-Gazette, the state
fhas lost track of nearly 10

percent of registered sex of-
fenders in the state — 923 of
about 9,800. GPS bracelets
would help locate these de-
linquent offenders, who have

Q either intentionally or acciden-

tally allowed the state to lose
track of them.
Sex offenders already have

5 to register on databases when
 they move, and depending on
 the severity of their crimes can
; remain on probation indefi-
 nitely and may have to check

in with police at intervals rang-

 ing from monthly to annually.

Pennsylvania, however, is
not the only state that has lost

I track of a large number of

sex criminals. According to a
number of reports released by

3 individual states in early 2003,
 Wisconsin had lost track of

about 29 percent of its 9,900
sex offenders, and California

 was unable to locate approxi-
‘i mately 44 percent, or about

33,000, of its 79,350 registered
offenders. _
If anything, Pennsylvania is
doing a good job of keeping
track of sex offenders, which
makes the GPS bracelets seem
unnecessary. And then there is

i the price to taxpayers to con-

sider as well.
GPS units in use for track-

 ing prisoners can cost more

than $300 per unit. Multiply
that times Pennsylvania’s 9,800
inmates and you’ve got almost
$3 million in initial expenses
alone, which doesn’t include
costs for monitoring equip-
ment or staff. To defray these
costs on taxpayers, most states
using GPS prisoner monitor-
ing charge people wearing the
bracelets a per—day charge for
operation costs, usually around
$10 to 3520.

But_ is it fair. to force all sex
offenders in the state to wear
GPS bracelets? True, about 10
percent are missing, but that
also means that around 90
percent aren’t. It’s also worth
considering that not all 9,800
people are violent child mo-
lesters — this is the total num-
ber of sex offenders in the
state, which includes people
who committed minor offens-
es against other adults.

Also, the proposal makes
no provision for monitoring
other violent criminals who
have jumped on probation but
instead specifies sex offenders
alone.

What about burglars or
people convicted of assault?
The proposition is simply ri-
diculous and inadequate on all
fronts.

Instead of spending mil-
lions of dollars to create an
Orwellian monitoring system
for a group of criminals that

SECURITY  

Stand by

by Molly Green
Co/wmziat

    

If there is one word to de-
scribe summer television, it deﬁ-
nitely is not “good.”

In fact, I don’t think there is
just one word that adequately
captures just how bad summer
programming- is. Perhaps the
scene of my mother and sister
watching Disney’s new summer
movie, “Camp Rock,” with slitted
eyes while sprawled out unmov-
ing on two couches as if they’d
been closed with a highly potent
barbiturate (probably the only
way to get through that movie)
conveys with more depth just
how desperate we -—— the habitual
television-watching demographic
-—— have become. .

The summer wait for prime-
time TV is a long one, especially
this summer, which followed the
shortest television season in my
lifetime, thanks to the 100-day-
long 2007-2008 Writers Guild of
America strike.

Unfortunately, television his-
tory threatens to repeat itself.

Speculation that the Screen
Actors Guild —— the labor union
representing more than 120,000
U.S. film and television actors, ac-

 

CHANGE

cording to the organization’s Web
site — might also go on strike
began shortly after the beginning
of the WGA strike, and now, af-
ter the July 10 failed negotiations
with the Alliance of Motion Pic-
ture and Television Producers to
renew its contract, which_expired
June 30,, things aren’t looking
good. ,

The situation is similar to last
year. AMPTP proposed a new
(crappy) contract. SAG, like the
WGA, responded with requests
for increased compensation from
new media and Internet proﬁts.
AMPT P, in usual form, balked on
the counteroffer, claiming that
SAG “puts labor peace at risk.”
This marks, I predict, the begin-
ning of a deluge of statements
that the organizations will release
in which they attack each other
in a back-and—forth manner, cul-
minating in the nation’s greatest

smack—talk competition since Ba- ,

rack and Hillary.

The complete logistics of
the July meeting aren’t entirely
known, though AMPTP studios
did have this to say: “[SAG] un-
reasonably expects to obtain
"more in these negotiations than
directors, writers and other ac-
tors obtained during their nego-
tiations.” '

COME ON Fﬂkliek...

 

SOME CHANGE  

Jake Brett I Staff Cartoonist

for television repeats

The studios went on to say
that the new contract “includes
more than $250 million  addi-
tional compensation, important
new media rights and protection
for pension and health beneﬁts.”

How much of this is true and
how much is spin, I’m doubt-
ful we’ll ever know. \What we do
know is that neither AMPTP
nor SAG is satisﬁed with cur-
rent offers and it leaves me with
aqueasy, foreboding feeling and
the image of SAG striking out-
side production studios while
AMPTP watches from above
while smoking $100 bills, aban-
doning the viewers to a fall sea-
son filled with reruns of summer
programming while brain matter
dribbles out of our ears.

Others appear more opti-
mistic/j delusional that the strike
won’t happen. it

An article by Entertainment
Weekly supposes that since-,.the
much smaller American Federa-
tion of Television and Radio Art-
ists (what SAG president Alan
Rosenberg referred to as the
union. for “newspeople, sport-
casters and Djs”) ratiﬁed its new
contract with AMPTP Tuesday,
this will somehow deter the SAG
membership from agreeing to
strike.

Save money and oil, ride a horse

by Josh Green
Colwn/ziat

 

I’m worried, people. Gas is at $4 a
gallon." Our government is acting like
Daniel Day—Lewis when it comes to
oil. We need a solution, and we need
it quickly. We’re the United States, for
crying out loud! How dare we pay the
same price for oil that other countries
have been paying for years? When
will some brave, courageous and
uncomfortably attractive individual
come along with the answer?

That time is now

I, an uncomfortably attractive
individual, have discovered the ulti-
mate solution for several problems
in American culture, including the
gas prices The saying goes, “less is
more.” I agree with this in all situa-

tions, except for when counting pres— .
ent biddies However, in this situation, ,

my idea is appropriate

Green, page 8 '

While I have hope that the
SAG-AMPTP dispute won’t reach
the level of an actual strike, after
the success ‘of the WGA strike,
I doubt SAG will settle without
putting up a bit of a ﬁght.

One would hope that AMPTP

would see reason. Last year’s

strike cost AMPTP and the Los

Angeles economy a lot of money’

— an NPR report puts the num-
ber at $1.5 billion. The economy
is suffering enough as is, and put-

about it.

The very act of “riding” a horse

This relieves us of our  at the

The more horses that are 
used as transportation, the fewer that

We can expect negotiations
to continue throughout the sum-
mer, which is good, because ﬁlm-
ing of the 2008-2009 television
season has already started. So,
should the worst happen  well,
let’s not think about that. 

On the bright side, if there is
a strike and next season is short

enough, we might just get that

 further with A'mel:ica’s “cow-
boy mentality,” increased gun owner-
ship would increase along with the in-
creased horse sales After all, how can
someone ride a horse if they aren’t
carrying a six—shooter? This would
effectively end the problem with
varying interpretations of the Second
Amendment. People who fear an in-
crease in gun violence can live com-
fortably  that it takes longer

V to load and reload a six—shooter than

anautomatic.
Everyone who fears the abandon-
ment of the Constitution and its

principles will be happy to hear that

cowboys will always be able to shoot
robbers to death and receive no pun-
ishment. The only difference is that
they will do it on horseback

What about horse excrement? I
have already thought about this. The
United States will simply hire people
to clean up horse feces This cre-

atesjobs and stabilizes the economy.
Horse-poo shovelers will have a job
that cannot be outsourced.

To recap, these are the beneﬁts of a

society of horseback riders: less car—'

bon emissions, less animal cruelty, less
illegal gun violence, more legal gun
violence, more poop-scooping jobs
It seems as though nothing could go
wrong with this plan.

Granted, sayers of “nay7’ will always
have some negative spin to give to

horseback riding “Oh, mine kicks.

me” or “Why doesn’t mine talk like
Mr. Ed?” or “Why isn’t Robert Red-
ford  to him?”

These. people want the United States
to fail. They want to see the United
States fall under control of Com-
munist China. Basically, these people
hate America It is up to supporters
of my horse plan, the real Patriots, to
maintain an ‘order and keep people
of  viewpoints silent and
muzzled.

That pretty much sums it up. If you’d
like to be a gun—toting, horseback-rid-

ing, lawless cowboy, then come to a
better America. Come to an America
of the fl.1tLl.t‘€. Come to “my’ ’ America.
Here, the men know what it means to
be men. Here, the horses know what
itis tobeabeastof burden.

This offers so much to so many.
Think of how many little  will
grow up to be balanced,  indi-
viduals because they ﬁnally had that
horse they always wanted. This is not
a matter of preventing a common
American problem. This is a matter
of creating a new American beneﬁt

Pirates continue to let the fans down

New York, page ll

It’s the entire culture surrounding a 
team chuck full 0’ stars in the Big Apple.

The Yankees are exciting. The Pirates are
dull. Alex Rodriguez? Steamy gossip surround-
ing him and Madonna. Derek jeter? Dating
whatever ridiculously hot actress or singer he
hasn’t yet. The Pirates’ latest gossip? Hahaha—
hahahal

The Yankees continue to carry the 
tradition —— they’ve now won four straight (as
of Monday) since the All—Star break and are
in the thick of the American League playoff
race — and the history. I_.osers of 5-of-6 as of
Monday and steaming ahead to a record 16th-
straight season of failure, the Pirates have a
w1nn' ing tradition that is history.

As for PNC Park? Looks can only go so
far. The finest ballpark in the United States
houses its antithesis, as far -as ball clubs go, and
the 19,360 that show _up on an average night
are a testament as to why.

The Penguins drew nearly as many fans
this past season, and PNC Park’s capacity is
more than double that of Mellon Arena. More
than 52,000 come to see the Yankees on a
nightly basis in The House That Ruth Built,
while PNC Park remains the House That Mc-

Clatchy Built

Oh, and the three highest—attended Pirates
games this year were, take a guess, when the
Yankees were in town. '

That Yankees series, even though broken
up by rain, had the most excitement since the
All-Star Game in 2006. This year’s All-Star’
Game was, not by chance, held in Yankee Sta-
dium in its 86th and final year. The aura sur-
rounding the game and the electric Home Run
Derby was dubbed nothing short of magical.
It was a celebration of baseball’s most histori-
cally dominant team and the men who made
it that way. 0

Now remember when the same All—Star
Game left Pittsburgh two years ago. Many
people saw the city for the first time since steel
and discovered it’s no longer cloaked in smog.
It was a great week’ in every measure for Pitts-
burgh. Yet an underlying theme, after the stars
had left, was how Pittsburgh deserves a win-
ning baseball team-and why the Pirates can’t I‘
deliver. _ ‘ "1

The why gets lost after so many years. It’s
hard to believe in something when you’ve nev-
er known anything other than the opposite

This summer I lived the opposite. And it’s
going to be tough to give it up.

At least until football season.

The Pitt News

by Tony Ferraiolo
A Senior Staff Writer

Pitt’s biggest guns were eliminated from
the playoffs Monday night in round one of
the Greentree Piftsburgh, Pro-Am summer
league. Levance Fields, Dejuan Blair and
Sam Young were all bounced from compe-
tition as a result of the ﬁrst-round defeats.

In the ﬁrst game of the night, the No.
6—seeded P&W Motors (1-7) picked up
its ﬁrst win of the summer, knocking off
No. 3-seeded Aliquippa Giant Eagle (4-4).
P&W took advantage of the absence of
Fields to hold on for the win.

In the second game of the night,

Young, Dwight Miller, Travon Woodall "I
and No. 5-seeded PGT (3-5) were domi-

nated from the start by Brad Wanamaker,
Ashton Gibbs, Tyrell Biggs and the‘ No.
4-seeded FWG Realty#(4-4). The game was
never close, and FWG would cruise to an
easy win.
Game 1: P&W 70 Aliquippa 65

This game wasn’t as close as the ﬁnal‘

score would indicate.

_ Both teams were missing key compo-
nents. P&W, which featured no Pitt players,
was without West Virginia sharpshooter
Alex Ruoff, who had a groin injury. Al-
iquippa was without Fields, who missed the
game to attend class. .

Aliquippa was clearly hurt worse by the
absence of Fields. Without a true point
guard to handle its offense, Aliquippa
looked sloppy throughout. Former Pitt
player Keith Benjamin did most of the
handling for Aliquippa, but was unable to
getthe offense going. .

Aliquippa never was able to establish
Blair, and, although P&W was forced to
play small, it was able to ‘contain Blair us-
ing a 2-3 zone throughout the whole game.
Blair struggled most of the game, ﬁnishing
just 7-of-23 from the ﬁeld. Sﬁll, Blair scored
20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds.

Blair often played away’ from the basket
when it was clear he could dominate inside.
With 15 minutesleft in the ﬁrst half, Baa
showed his post presence with a monstrous
dunk at one end and then a demoralizing
block on the other. But otherwise, Blair

biggest Panthers

was seldom heard from in the paint.

He did, however, show a nice touch
from the line going 6-of-9, including ﬁve
in a row.

Aliquippa creeped back in the game

near the half, but Radford’s Arnir Johnson .

(16 points, ﬁve assists andqthree rebounds)
nailed a 3-pointer as the ﬁrst-half buzzer
sounded to give P&W a 34-27 lead that it
would never relinquish.

With seven minutes left in the game, Al-
iquippa went to a full-court press and was
able to creep within three points. But P&W
made its free throws and advanced to Tues-
day night’s semi-ﬁnals. ‘

Game 2: FWG 82 PGT 59

As it has the past few weeks, the back-
court of Gibbs and Wanamaker looked
impressive. '

Matched up with Young throughout,
Wanamaker was able to out-duel Pitt’s su-
per senior. Young had a bad shooting night
and ended the night 5 for 14. But some
of Young’s struggles were credited to Wa-
namaker’s tough defense against the bigger
man. « I
Wanamaker, who ﬁnished with 15
points, four assists and two rebounds, con-
tinued to exude conﬁdence in all facets of
his game. Young frequently picked Wana-

maker up full-court, but the pressure rarely .

got to the sophomore guard.

Wanamaker has shown improvement
with his jump shot from the outside this
summer, but it’s been his strength and abil-
ity to ﬁnish inside with contact that’s been
one of the biggest changes.‘

Gibbs, a freshman, was equally irn—
pressive. Again, he was perfect from the
outside, hitting all three of his 3-point at-
tempts. Gibbs ﬁnished the game with 18
points and two rebounds. _

Freshman Dwight Miller didn’t have his
best game (ﬁve points, three rebounds) for
PGT, but did display high intensity. He also
hit a 3-pointer in the second half.

Tyrell Biggs also chipped in 12 points
and ﬁve rebounds, as FWG moved on to
the semi-ﬁnals.

Sophomore - guard/ forward Gilbert
Brown‘ did not play for PGT. '

Pitt football collects
second lineman for ’09

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta E3itor

The Pitt football team snagged its sixth
commitment for the 2009 season Monday,
when offensive lineman Fernando Diaz
told the Pitt coaching staff he wanted to
be a Panther. ‘

Diaz comes from Cardinal Hayes High
School in the Bronx, N.Y., where Pitts-
burgh Steelers’ offensive lineman W/illie

Colon also attended before heading to,

Hofstra University.

The 6—foot—2, 285—pound guard is
ranked as the No. 9 prospect in the state of
New York by Rivals.com. He was recruited

by running backs coach Dave Walker,and
picked Pitt over Army and Connecticut.

Since signing day isn’t until the spring,
no recruits can actually sign yet. All com—
rnitrnents continue to be verbal, which
means although rare, players can change
their minds at the last minute.

Diaz joins Cory King, an offensive tack-
le, as the second commit on the offensive
line for the Panthers. ‘

certainly do have the ability to con-

jure a crowd.
Karen Brooks—Reese, from the
teen department at Carnegie Li-

brary,- recalls the first wizard-rock ,

performance she ever set up with
Carnegie libraries, which was also
the first wizard-rock show she at-
tended. When more than 350 peo-
ple came to the show, she realized
she had found an event worthy of
repeating. Back then, in July of
2006, shewas the one who called
the bands. ‘

Today, the contacting runs in
the opposite direction.’ The bands
normally call ahead to let Brooks-
Reese knowiwhen they can be in
Pittsburgh, and she decides wheth-
er or not the dates fit for a potential
event.

In the case of wizard rock, a
possible event seems to entail the

- opposite ideals of a library — after

all, isn’t rock, even if it does have

a “w”_ attached to the front, loud? ‘
The difference isn’t so overpower-

mg;

“You’re taking books and music

and making them the same thing,’_’
said Brooks—Reese. In her view,
wizard rock has particularly strong
implications for the teen books de-

' partment, which is appealing to a

demographic expected to be ‘mak-
ing music a very large part of their
lives.

Brooke-Reese believes people
can experience literature even
when not reading it ‘There’s more

to literacy than sticking your nose

in a boo _” she said. Typically the
group names make reference to

an occurrence or character in the

book.

Visiting the Wizrocklopediai

online reveals a plethora of titles

from the obvious “Harry Potters” _

to what could be construed as rid-
dles, such asSnufﬂes and the Furry
Little Problem.

If the last title doesn’t recall
literary events, it might be worth
speaking to a wizard—rock enthu-
siast. For example, the Pittsburgh
Area Wizards, or P.A.W, is an orga-
nization dedicated to wizard rock
The president, Rose Creek, leads
in efforts to connect wizard—rock’
groups to possible venues, arrang-
es for fellow enthusiasts to meet
before concerts and, additionally,
holds bimonthly meetings,

In fact, the Harry Potter fan
world has even extended its actions
so far into real events that it has
reached politics. The Harry Potter
Alliance, of which PA.W recently
became a chapter, is aimed at mo-
 younger voters.

Although it isn’t certain yet
whether or not the members of
P.A.W will be recording the per-
formance and trading the show
tapes for years to come, ‘there was
recently a “Wrocls:stock” held out-
side St. Louis on Memotial Day.
Brooks—Reese is a witness to the
dedication of wizard-rock fans. v

f‘We have people who have '

come to every show,” said Brooks-
Reese. «
However, the wizard—rock con-

cert in Schenley Plaza isn’t air_ned '

at one select group of die-‘hard
fans. As Brooks—Reese sees it, the
bands have similar goals as the li-
brary, in that their ,music about a
literary series is ultimately 

’ listeners back to the original canon.

While The Remus Lupins’ “More-
of a Physical Beingf’ is about the
fantasy game of Quidditch and the
fictional character of Viktor Krurn,

the lyiics stay simple, as in the lines

“When I danced, you smiled / And

. whispered something / ButI could i

not hear you / Nah-nah-no.”

Book's over,
but Potter
mania lives on

Wizards, page 18

While some casual prospective listeners
might beturned off by the esoteric subject
matter and the simple lyrics, the music still
carries an upbeat pop—punk Vibe. The geeky
infusion has rendered a surprisingly fresh take,
honest and straightforward in its presentation
and untainted by starry ego.

In addition to bringing refreshing music
to the scene, the members of the band might
be surprising in person, as well. Whﬂe a name
such as The Remus Lupins might suggest "a
group of players, Brooks-Reese was surprised
to meet the group for -the first time and dis-
cover thatit was only the leader, Alex Carpen-
ter, who was an actual member. Although his
music features more than one voice, Such as
the backing chorus in “Looking for Trouble,”
Brooks—Reese was unsure whether or not
there would be accompanying musicians with
Carpenter this year.

Regardless, she is optimistic, as is Creek,
who will be meeting fans before the show as
always. Theconcert begins at 7 p.m. at Schen-
ley Plaza.
