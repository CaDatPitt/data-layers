Pitt Budget Passes House; Faces Setback In Senate  

Pitt officials came one step closer to determining
the 1979-80 university budget with last weeks 102-99
passage of the state budget by the Republican-
controlled house.

The administration will most likely take a step
backwards later this week as the Senate, with its
Democrat majority, is expected to reject Gov. Dick
Thornburgh’s $6 billion budget, amended by the

House to appropriate $67 million to Pitt, a 6.5 per-”

cent increase over last year.

recommending a 4.5 percent increase in funding, the
House suggesting a six percent raise and the Senate
recommending a who-knows-what increase. Of-.

The Board of Trustees will meet here June 12 to

approve a budget. According to the Secretary’s’of-A

Candidate List Narrows
For Activities Director

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Search Committee for a new
student activities director will
choose eight to 10 senii-ﬁnalists to
invite to Pitt for interviews during
the next two or three weeks,
according to Robert Gallagher,
chairman of that committee.

The committee, has reviewed
some 102 applications for the
position and has narrowed the ﬁeld
to 28, Gallagher said.

Many qualiﬁed applicant have
undergone extensive phone refer-
ence checks by committee mem-
bers, according to Gallagher.»

The committee contacted super»

visors, collegues, other
acquaintances and other listed
references to verify the candidates
description of current job responsi-
bilities, to determine their out-
standing abilities, energy level,
creativity, initiative, and other
personal qualities, Gallagher said.

Those applicants who declined to“

have their references contacted by
the committee have presented
/some problems for Gallagher.
“It makes it a little more difﬁcult
to do our work,” ‘Gallagher said.
Representatives of various stu-
dent groups along with members of
the student activities staff, a group
of faculty administrators who
interact with the student activities
ofﬁce and the search committee
will interview the semi-ﬁnalists.
The _student groups invited to
participate in the interviews
include the Student Government
Board, Black Action Society,
General Studies Student Cabinet
and other organizations.
Semi-ﬁnalists will be questioned
concerning management style,
philosophy of student develop-
ment, ideas about meeting the
needs .of special student "con-
stituencies, dealing with budget
cuts,’ objectives and ideas the

candidates have about the office,-

Gallagher said.

Anti-Nuclear Protests
Land Hundreds in Jail

By The Associated Press

Only a few dozen people
remained in American jails Mon-
day after a weekend of inter‘-
national protests against nuclear
power that resulted in more than a
thousand arrests ‘in the United
States and a death in Spain.

The death of a female demon-
strator on Sunday during Inter-
national Anti-Nuclear Day
triggered riots throughout Spain7s
Pamplona region that spilled
over into Monday.

More than 1,200 U.S. anti-nucle-
at and environmental groups.
Most of those arrested were
charged with minor offenses
ranging from trespassing to dis-
turbing the peace.

7

; At many dmonstrations, pro-

testors carried signs reading, “Hell
No, We Won’t Glow.” Others
chanted “Two, four, six, eight, we
don’t want to radiate.” At the
Marble Hill plant site near
.- Madison, Ind., balloons were

»

released with attached cards
reading: “If this balloon’ reached
you, so can radiation from the
Marble Hill nuclear plant.”
Forty-one of 119 protesters
arrested at Virginia Electric &
Power Co.’s North Anna plant near
Louisa, Va., remained in jail

« Monday, refusing to sign summons

or to post bond. About 10 being
held in jails in Louisa and Orange
counties began a hunger strike
Sunday night and continued it
Monday.

Near the Long Island community
of Shoreham, N.Y., 43 of 571
people arrested at a nuclear power
plant were being held on charges of
criminal trespass. The 43 refused
to give their names and addresses.
The others were given summonses
to appear in court and then
released. Among those arrested
were Joyce Berland, daughter of
former Defense Secretary Clark
Clifford, and former Chicago 7
defendants Jerry Rubin and David
Dellinger.

°Congratulations are in order to Vice Provost

David Powers, who last week accepted the position
-of vicepresident for academic affairs at George

‘ Mason College near Washington, D.C. Powers will

moving to a college that is in an unusual position—its
student body is expected to increase from the current
10,767 to 17,000 by 1985.

Powers became “spokesman” for Pitt’s research-
oriented administration two winters ago following at-
tacks by critics of the “research over teaching” at-
titude prevalent throughout colleges today. ,

°The 47th annual United Stated Mayors Con-
ference will officially open in Pittsburgh at Carnegie
Museum six p.m. this Saturday. on Monday the

mayors and their wives will be highlighted with ap- _

pearances by Vice-President Walter Mondale,
Secretay of Commerce Juanita Kreps and Labor
Secretary Ray Marshall.
hopefuls John Connolly, Howard Baker, John An-
derson and Philip Crane are also expected to speak at
the conference. '

No doubt low summer term attendance is theeason this erformer has no audience, and not his guitar playing.

L.A. Rebounds From
  Weekend Loses To
  Defeat Pirates, 4.2  

B_y Thu Associated Press

Rookie Rick Sutcliffe pitched a
four’-hitter and Joe Ferguson
rapped a two-run homer to lead the
Los A eles Dodgers to a 4-2
victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates
Monday night in a regionally-
televised game.

Sutcliffe, 6-3, notched» his ﬁfth
victory in his last six decisions as
the Dodgers rebounded from three
straight defeats over the weekend
in St. Louis.

Ferguson’s second-inning homer
off loser Jim Rooker, 2-1, followed
a two-out walk to Dusty Baker. It
was Ferguson’s eighth homer of
the season.

In the Los Angeles third, Dave

Lopes singled by Reggie Smith and
scored on Steve Garvey’s double.

Dave Parker countered with a
two-run, inside-the-park home run
in the fourth. After Tim Foli
singled, Parker hit a drive- to
straightaway center ﬁeld. Out-
ﬁelder Derrel Thomas raced to the
warning track and got a glove on
the ball, but dropped it as he
slammed to the ground. It was the
10th homer of the season for Parker
and his second inside-the-park shot
this season.

The Dodgers added another run
in the ﬁfth inning, when Lopes
rapped his third straight single and
scored on a double by Bill Russell.

By The Associated Press
HARRISBURG-1. Charles Mc-

‘ ,Cullough says there’s ‘no mystery
‘behind his decision-to continue as
executive director of the Pennsyl- ‘

vania Interscholastic Athletic As-
sociation. S
McCullough withdrew his letter
of resignation two weeks after he
had submitted it.
“I simply changed my mind,”

Varner, who made the announce-
ment on a local television station,
thus ended one of the more
prolonged, intense recruiting

campaigns in scholastic basketball
this year. ~

Among the colleges that had
been in the ﬁnal running were
Marquette, Duquesne, Pitt, Penn

Decision No Mystery

said McCullough when asked why
he had decided not to become»
president and chief executive
ofﬁcer of Pennsylvania Associa-
tions of Travel and Hospitality.

“It was a ﬁne offer, but after I
had accepted it I began to have
second thoughts. I realized that my

‘ entire background has A been in

sports.
- “The more I thought about it,
the more I realized that my letter of

resignation had been a mistake.”
McCullough and Board of
Control president Mike Arbutina of
Western Beaver High School
denied any deals had been made.
“That all started because some
of the board members indicated
they ‘wanted me to reconsider and
had said publicly they wanted to

I know what it would‘take to get me

to change my mind,” said

McCullough.

State, West Virginia and Hawaii.

Varner, who may play guard or
forward as a collegian, averaged 20
points and 17 ‘rebounds per game
last season in -leading Valley to the
Class AAA championship of the
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athle-
tic Association.

Notre Dame Coach Digger
Phelps is currently with his squad
on a summer tour of Yugoslavia.

However, Danny Nee, Notre
Dame’s assistant coach in charge of
recruiting, _spent much of his time
in recent weeks courting Varner in
New Kensington, Pa.

“Billy is one of the best players
in the United States,” Nee said
recently. “He just hasn't received
the publicity the others have
received. ’ ’ v \

Much Sought After Vamer Heads For Notre Dame

Notre Dame’s interest in Varner
was heightened by outstanding
play in several post-season all-star
games scouted personally by
Phelps. it

“Digger was really, really
impressed,” said Nee. “He really
liked Billy's style of play. When
the head man says, ‘Go get him,’
that’s what.you do.”

Varner and the Valleyteam were
honored recently at a testimonial
dinner. A total of 14 collegiate
head coaches and assistants
showed up for the banquet, and a
few were still watching Varner-’-s
disco style at a dance afterward.

“He plays without the ball as
well as anyone I’ve seen in high
school this year,” said Marquette
Coach Hank Raymonds.

Has Tarkanian Run Out of Luck at Las Vegas?  

Vegas — Nevada basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian
may not be around by the beginning of the 1979-80
season.

Tarkanian and Las Vegas Nevada have been under‘

NCAA investigation and the Rebels’ coach, under
pressure from the NCAA, is reported scouting
around for other employment opportunities.

Whether it’s the result of the recent decision of the
Supreme Court of Nevada sustaining the NCAA
ruling against Tarkanian or Tark’s desire to better
himself, whichever, the word is out of Las Vegas that
he will not be the head basketball coach when the
first tipoff of the season takes place this fall.

Tarkanian’s next move——to the pro or other
college ranks-—isn’t clear.

-—Western. Pennsylvania native Frank Cignetti,
West Virginia University head football coach, will
soon undergo treatment for cancer.

The 40-year-old Cignetti had been operated on
shortly after the conclusion of the 1978 football
season. His ailment was ‘diagnosed as lymphoid
granulomatos'rs.-

“This is a disease related to the..lympnom’a group‘

of tumors,” said Cignetti’s attending physcian.
“The treatment, which will consist of a combination
of steroids and chemotherapy, will start within*the
next few weeks.”

On the Ru

By MARIA SCIULLO

 

With Cignetti undergoing treatment, it is probable
the Mountaineers will serve under a new head coach
come September. One candidate for the job could be
Carnegie-Mellon head coach Chuck Klausing.
Klausing once held the top assistant’s job at WVU
under Bobby Bowden. ,

—Panther triple jumper Larry Kinney turned in
the best showing of all freshmen competing in last
weekend’s NCAA track championships. Kinney
placed 15th out of the 25 jumpers who qualified for
the meet, held in Champaign, Illinois.

Kinney’s jump of 50-5 was not enough to qualify

for the finals, but was the conclusion to a season
which saw the freshman break both the Pitt indoor
and outdoor records. A I

The jumpers, said coach Mike Agostinella, were
hampered by delays of up to 55 minutes in between
each competitors three jumps in the trials.

—One of the highlights of the meet was Villanova
ace Don Paige’s double win in the 800 and 1500
meter races. His times of 1:46.] and 3239.4 make
him a definite contender for the 1980 American
Olympic team. Teammate Sydney Maree set a new
NCAA record in the 5000 meters. His 13:21 clocking
broke Henry Rono’s old collegiate mark.

—-The singing of Valley’s Bill Varner with Notre
Dam puts an end to the waiting for Marquette, Pitt
and several other hopeful institutions.

Last week, the recruiting picture had been so mud-
dled that Marquette’s head coach Hank Raymonds
called the Pitt offices to ask a‘coach if he had heard
anything new as to the status of Varner’s decision.
Raymonds also expressed his desire for Varner to at-
tend Pitt rather than Notre Dame, if Marquette
couldn’t sign the all-American forward.
