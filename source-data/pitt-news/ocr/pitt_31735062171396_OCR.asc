"New” Moratorium

 

SM 6’ Demands £144 of War

(Editor's Note: October 15, 1969

—a year and a clay ago, the Mora-

torium Committee to End the War

held it's first day long peace cam-
paign. Nov. l5—Almost a million
people converged on Washington

for the Moratorium Today, the war
still continues. To many Americans,
the war is not a dead issue. lt is al-
most fitting that a year after its in-
ception it should all begin again.)

 CLASSROOMS WERE universally vacant, last year, although a slew of pro-
 fessors demonstrated their opposition to the Moratorium by scheduling
 quizzes and examinations on the date.

Conspiracy Lawyer to Defend Pittsburgh 5

Kunstler, Davis to Rap Repression

 

 

RENNIE DAVIS-co-defendant in the Chicago Seven Trial, speaking at a

May Day rally at the University ‘in 1968.

by ELLEN GANLEY

The Chicago Seven. Remember
them? They were the defendents
in the conspiracy trial that follow-
ed the violent demonstrations in
Chicago during the 1968 Demo-
cratic Convention.

Two of the more well known
participants in this trial. William
Kunstler. the attorney for the de-
fense, and Rennie Davis. one of
the defendants. will speak in
Pittsburgh on Oct. 23 at the Car-
negie Music Hall.

Kunstler and Davis encounter-
ed some difficulty in finding a
place to speak. The groups spon-
soring their appearance, the Stu-
dent Bar Association at Pitt, The
Tartan and the Revolutionary Al-
liance at C-MU, originally hoped
to get the Pitt Field House for the
lecture.

When Paul Boas, a member of
the Student Bar Association, con-
tacted Casmir Myslinski. the Pitt
athletic director, he was given
various excuses why the Pitt fa-
cility could not be used.

One reason cited by Myslinski
was that the Field House 'is used
for athletic events only. This ex-
cuse is invalid because Dick.
Gregory spoke there two years

 

g_C-MU administration flatly re-

  
 
   

NOTHING ELSE
Because there was no other fa-

.cility on the University campus

that could accommodate the 2.-
000 persons expected to attend.
the organizing groups decided to
try C-MU.

 

WILLIAM KUNS'|’l.ER—chiet counsel-
lor for the Chicago Seven; his visit
next weekend follows that of his
associate Leonard Weinglass by a
few weeks. '

There the group was advised by
a dean to obtain a note from the
Pitt administration saying that
Pitt would like to host the speak-
ers but are unable because of lack
of facilities.

The note was obtained but the

While the war in Southeast Asia
has continued. the home front has
been relatively quiet. Few anti-
war demonstrations have taken
place since the March on Wash-
ington last November and those
that have were very minor.

The Student Mobilization to End
the War in Vietnam SMC) has an-
nounced that it does not intend to
let matters continue at this rate
much longer. In a recent press
release. the SMC stated. “There
is no basis whatsoever for believ-
ing that President Nixon‘s major
new initiative for peace is any
more real or credible than pre-
vious ploys by Nixon or Johnson
before him.

The SMC contends that “the
major new initiative is really an
attempt to hustle votes on Nov. 3
for candidates who support the
administration. Beyond bolster-

the opportunity to speak on their
campus.

In a letter to the members of
the community, Dr. H. Guyford
Stever, president of C-MU, listed
the following reasons for the re-
quest’s denial: (1) risks of over
crowding the gymnasium, (2)
the likelihood of disturbances, (3)
the necessary assignment of
large numbers of police to handle
traffic, leaving the balance of the
University exposed, (4) the seri-
ous parking problem, and (5) that
because an off-campus group is
sponsoring the lecture, C-MU
would have to take full responsi-
bility to persons and property.

Both Pitt and C-MU had previ-
ously stated that they intended to
invite speakers of all views to ap-
pear at their universities.

The hedging of both schools on
the Kunstler—Davis appearance
indicates that the administration
might not have been as sincere in
their liberal attitude as they
would like to have been.

AGAINST REPRESSION

Since the controversial Chicago
trail. Kunstler and Davis have
continued their fight against re-
pression.

In a local issue. William Kunst-

ler is acting as co-council with

Harry F. Swanger in filing an in-
junction against the ruling of the
Pittsburgh courts concerning a
riot last year in a magistrate‘s
court.

The injunction which Kunstler
aided Pittsburgh attorneys in
drawing up was initially thrown
out of court by a 78 year old
judge.

The group then took the injunc-
tion to the Third Circuit Court in
Philadelphia and the previous de-
cision was immediately reversed.

The main purpose of the injunc-
tion, according to Boas, is to stop
the senseless police brutality of
anyone who is “hippy-like” in ap-

ing Republican chances at the
polls next month, Nixon's state-
ment is. aimed at undercutting the
pressure of mass anti-war ac-
tions demanding ‘Bring all the
GI’s home now!”’

On Oct. 31, anti-war demon‘-
strations are scheduled in 30 ci-
ties throughout the country.
These demonstrations are aimed
at the immediate withdrawal of
all U.S. troops from Indochina.

"Remembering that ten days
after his last peace gesture Nix-
on sent U.S. troops into Cambo-
dia the SMC stated, “we intend

reasoning anyway, a menace to so-
ciety.

The co-defendants cited by the
injunction are Francis Quinlan,
president of the Fraternal Order
of Police; William Gilmore, for-
mer assistant Superintendent of
Police; District Attorney Robert
Dugan; Charles Satchko, bailiff in
Magistrates Court. and five or six
other police who participated in
the beatings.

If the injunction succeeds, the
charges against the defendants in
the court riot case will be drop-
ped.

Kunstler is involved in another
trial, but in these proceedings he
is the defendant instead of the de-
fense attorney.

Yesterday. he was to appear in
Canada on assault charges stem-
ming from his pouring water on a
member of the Edmund Burke So-
ciety, which is the Canadian
equivalent of the John Birch So-

to redouble our efforts to organ-
ize massive participations in the
Oct. 31 anti-war demonstra-
tions.

Although cessation of the Indo-
china conflict is the prime goal
of the SMC, their concern goes be-
yond this. The SMC points out that
“the President spoke about the
release of .all prisoners of war.
We demand that Nixon grant im-
mediate amnesty to the thousands
of American youth in U.S. jails
and in Canada whose only crime
is refusal to take part in the geno-
cidal war in Indochina."

Conference Supports

Legal Abortion Bill

Representatives from colleges
throughout the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania held a conference
Saturday at Dickinson College in
Carlisle, as a result of the lack of
university participation at the
“Governor’s Conference on the
Environment” held on Sept. 17
and 18in Hershey, Pa.

The conference, consisting of
university faculty members and
students, drafted several speci-
fic recommendations to be sent to
Governor Raymond P. Shafer and
discussed a statewide communi-
cations network with resources
available through the academic
community ‘and environmental ed-
ucation programs. Several of the
major proposals are listed be-

 

  

1. Endorsement_ of Pennsyl-
vania House Bill 2393 or any

similar legislation calling for the ~- I

legalization of abortion in the
State of Pennsylvania.

2. No taxes collected from
the citizens of Pennsylvania
should be used for the purpose
of the super-sonic transport
(SST). Furthermore, the SST
should be banned from all air-
space and airport facilities of the
Commonwealth.

3. All chlorinated hydrocarbons

such as DDT and any related pes- .,

iijiiistudent Nurses Vote

 

T 1 by BOB GEDEKOH

5 if  The sophomore, junior and sen-
fior classes of the Pitt School of
'i'"t”Nursing voted to refrain from tak-
 Qingthe‘ election break on Nov. 2
"s-and‘3 which the University Senate

  - Marguerite J. Schaefer, dean of
""‘i,-gthe School of Nursing, called an
.:;:::;a'”s§embly on Monday to explain
.7. i"the"situation and allow the nurs-
 -injglstudents to choose the course

 -of action which they preferred.

‘de-ntswas practical rather than

J ‘ since the decision of the Univer-
,_».-;l; sity Senate last spring, the Inter-
 Anal Revenue Service has ruled

 "SW4;-Any university who fails to

" A-.[its, tax-exempt status. Schaefer
 said that this would result in the
 disastrous loss of large sums of
3-f."'?. money, which would have to be
 " _taken.from student’s tuition.

 notfeel that the decision made
F. last spring represented the opin-
‘I ‘ion of’ the three groups in the Uni-
}j}ver,sity: the students, the faculty
I‘ and the administration. She re-
 igardied the decision as one made

 any-or feasibility of the decision.

ed about the election recess as
with the reading period which is
usually held two days before fin-
als. Many students seemed to fav-
or such a reading period, but Dean
Schaefer noted that last year
when one was granted many stu-
dents complained.

She added that it is impossible
to please everyone all of the time.
Several students complained that
the CAS was granting the recess
while ‘the Nursing
School was not.

Dean Schaefer told the students
that they were students in nurs-
ing and could not expect to be
treated as CAS students. “You
are majors in nursing, and nurses
have responsibilites which are not
covered by the College of Arts and
Sciences. Your first responsibil-
ity is the care of patients.“

She added that to avoid further
confusion a calendar would be dis-
tributed to the students.

Although several students felt
that Dean Schaefer's comments
on the responsibility of the nurs-
ing professions were merely a
way of skirting changes in pro-
gram, the general consensus was
that it was preferential -to attend
classes during the recess, rather
than cut into the Christmas vaca-
tion.

Schaefer said she hoped that the
27 who voted for the recess sin-
cerely wanted it for political rea-
sons, but many of the students
polled indicated that they felt that
the 27 merely wanted a break
from classes. ,

Dean Schaefer hopes that inter-
play between the three decision-
making bodies in the University
would prevent such situations
from arising in the future.

  7 Contest Causes   Cflic

by DANA VENTRIGLIA

With theprogression of this
year's homecoming queen con-
test, a minor controversy has
arisen between advocates of the
women's liberation movement
and supporters of the contest.

A spokeswoman for the Pitts-
burgh Radical Women‘s Union
condemned the affair as being
sexists and racist, nothing that
the criteria for judging the candi-
dates was personality and physi-
cal beauty. She emphasized the
point that although there is no evi-

  

CANDY GEARING

 

 

     

dence of overt racism, the con-
test has become a vice for promo-
tion of institutionalized racism
at the University.

The spokeswoman adamantly
stated that “contests such as
these will jeopardize the feminist
fight by reinforcing the status quo
and institutionalizing the oppres-
sion and stereotyped images of
women.”

Another member of the Union
called the “sexploitation.“ say-
ing that “it puts women in the
position of animals to be judged;
beauty contests treat women‘s
bodies as public property."

Debbie Gigliotti. chairwoman
for this year‘s homecoming. along
with the five finalists objected the
contest being viewed in this light.
Miss Gigliotti mentioned that the
queen will not be picked on the
basis of facial beauty. but on per-
sonality, poise, campus activities
and how well the candidate can
communicate.

“The organizations nominated
the girls,” stated Miss Gigliotti,
“because they thought they could
best represent the University of
Pittsburgh.” '

The candidates interviewed pre-
ferred to remain annonymous. but

the general opinion was that the
contest was valid as a long stand-
ing tradition of the University and
and as an honor. for the students
involved. One finalist felt that the
issue was being blown out of pro-
portion by the opposition.

None of the participants were
actively involved in the liberation
movement, but all thought that the
contest would have no detrimental
effect in the objectives of the
movement. Theyfelt that the con-
test should be retained as a part
of homecoming in order to pre-
serve a standing tradition of col-
leges and universities across the
nation.

by DON MARBURY, Editor

One of the most integral and traditional parts of any university‘s Homecoming
period has been the competition and eventaul crowning of a young women to reign as the
school’s Homecoming Queen.

Every year the different school fraternities and dormitories at the University sub-
mit a women to represent their fraternity or dorm who they feel should represent the
university, and while it may be denied, the physical looks of the women chosen are one of
 the prime considerations made in the selection.  ‘

g It is almost inconceiveable that a women, who say by present standards would not
be considered attractive or by whose looks many people might put into the class of
“ugly,” could even be considered in the selections for Homecoming Queen.

What does a person have to do with the way he or she looks? We’re not speaking in
terms of makeup, clothing, hair style, or any of the other things that are now considered
when looking at a person. We’re talking about the shape or size of a person’s nose or lips,
the strength or weakness of her chin, the true length of the eyelashes, and the fullness of
the cheeks.

We have nothing to do with how we look, yet we have set standards of what is beau-
tiful and what isn’t and even give awards and honor those who fit into that mold of beauty.

Our Homecoming contest, just like any beauty contest is racist. True. the Black
fraternities and organizations on this campus have chosen not to enter any contestants.
but only because they know at a predominantly white school—in a predominantly white
country for that matter——that beauty if light skin, stringy hair. and small nose and lips.

W Of, course, there are those in the University who would contest that last statement
 that they can see beauty in Black people, but what are the chances that they would
want a Black Queen representing their campus? As a representative of the kind of Uni-
versity we are. ‘

But an even bigger point is the exploitation and institutionalized disrespect for
women that the event symbolizes. If someone who didn't know any better had viewed the
Pitt Homecoming Queen contests over a couple of years and thought that the women

New 86 Constitution

chosen were typical college girls, he would have to assume that all college women were
white. had smooth skin. very well built. at least a 34C, had long hair. and had nicely
shaped hairless, markless legs.

Typical of all University women‘?

It would be really nice if just once a women could be chosen to represent anything.
because of her mind. or her accomplishments——for the things that really make that wom-
en unique. '

Men, have you ever wondered why there’s no Homecoming King picked? Didn't
you know that the football players represent you? And you can bet if a king contest were
held, the winner wouldn't have acne, weigh 95 pounds or be overweight, and not be what
many people "consider a “real loser.”

Can‘t you see the obvious inequities? Homecoming Queen just like any other beau-
ty contest winner is picked for all the wrong reasons. People should be honored for their
accomplishments. for the things they do_——for what's inside of them; not for that unrea-
sonable facsimile you caress with your eyes.

the chance. go to a County Fair when they give the blue ribbons to the prize Hereford. and

The candidates thoughts and views on the subjects young people and the world are
facing should have been a primary consideration. Her involvement in something she
deemed relevant should have been another.

Things like versality, talent‘ in various fields, and other enviable traits seem more
important than whether a women played with dolls during her childhood rather than clim-

The procedure for choosing persons to represent this University must change. The
qualifications now are bigoted. sexist. and do nothing but perpetrate exploitation.

it‘s an old. bad tradition.

 Writer Cohen Consistently W/,, 3,-,,,,,,,,,,,

Ignores E.

The Editor, The Pitt News:

I have been following with some
interest the articles of the cam-
pus Marxist, Mark Cohen, and the
letters written in reply to and cri-
ticism of his statements.

My first acquaintance with Co—
hen's writings came last year

’ ("‘.when he wrote a letter to The Pitt

News claiming that racism was a
concomitant of capitalism (Sept.
15, 1969).

In a very well-put and fair re- ‘

ply to Cohen, a reader cited the
anti-semitism in Russia and
Eastern Europe as one demon-
stration of the fact that the eco-
nomic system has nothing to do
with the existence of racism
(Sept. 22). Cohen chose to
misunderstand the argument,
claim instead that he was being
accused of being a “traitor to Ju-
daism,“ and, of course, to acquit
himself most nobly of that charge
(Oct. 22).

( \_ In the flurry of charges and cri-
“dcism this term, Mr. Cohen care-
fully ignored a letter from one
reader, offering a definition of
“imperialism“ and pointing out
the Soviet armed invasion of
Czechoslovakia as a most blatant
example of it (Sept. 18, 1970).

Instead, Mr. Cohen to date has
only replied to a later letter by a
different reader debunking the
idea of capitalist imperialism

(Sept. 28) with his own vague

Europeans

claim that the U.S. had “helped
engineer" the counter-coup in In-
donesia in which a huge number of
Communists were turned upon
and slaughtered by their fellow
countrymen (Oct. 2).

It has aroused my curiosity that
Mr. Cohen has evaded so consis-
tently any arguments which call
in the Communist governments of
Eastern Europe as examples.

Since I have great faith in Co—
hen’s continued ability to misun-
derstand or ignore such argu-
ments in future skirmishes with
“right wing elements," I should
like to ask him quite directly how
he, as a professing Marxist,
views the governments of East-
ern Europe, particularly the So-
viet Union, which are directed by
men who also profess Marxism.

In this request I most sincerely
beg the pardon of other readers‘
for actually asking for an article
from Cohen, but it seems to me
that we are, alas, fated to hear
from again many times anyway
and that we might as well draw
whatever amusement we
can from the situation.

‘ ‘Disappointing ’ ’
The Editor, The Pitt News:

Jack Simmons‘ letter (Sept. 28)
has to be one of the most ridicu-
lous letters I have read in quite a
long time. To classify the entire
left, including Galbraith. as be-
ing Marxist is not only a gross
misconception, but an example of
the type of crap fed to us daily by
the Nixon-Agnew team. Anyone
who disagrees\with administra-
tion policy is being coined a “rad-
ical-liberal," whatever that
means.

It makes me sick to think that

this “liberal" university has pro-
duced after four years, a speci-
men such as Simmons. Like our
current administration, his sense
of history seems to be distorted.

_ Everything is either black or
white, completely right or com-
pletely wrong, extreme left or ex-
treme right.

Your knowledge of terms is
overwhelming. Simmons, but
have you every bothered to open
your mind to people or things
around you? If you have then you
can see that this world is not as
rosy as you paint it to be. Unfor-
tunately, Mr. Simmons, capital-
ism and the “American dream"

Wednesday, October 14, 1970-THE PITT NEWS-Page 5

are not as perfect as you would
like us to believe.

A letter such as Simmons‘, only
makes me wonder whether all
members of the YAF are as shal-
low as he is. If they are. then the
YAF and Jack Simmons should be
very happy together.

Bleeding Heart
Attacks Dissenters

The Editor, The Pitt News:

If I were to approach a police-
man on the street and hurl an ob-
scene insult in his face, I have not
the slightest doubt that I would
be arrested at once. Yet, when a
huge crowd gathered menacingly,
impeded traffic, disturbed the
peace, and flung barrages of such
insults at the police, with smaller
groups burning flags, driving cars
into the po1ice’s flank, setting off
fire alarms, etc. last Tuesday at

  

the Hilton, the participants were
“surprised" to find themsleves
arrested or. if they were lucky,
simply billy-clubbed.

No one can tell me that these
people did not expect this treat-
ment when they joined the dem-
onstration. They knew such pro-
tests engender confrontations and
violence, but they came anyway.

Would it have really made any
difference if everyone had heard
the order to disperse? Shouldn‘t
the appearance of the police force
have been sufficient warning? I
submit that these protestors ac-
tually desired such a confronta-
tion.

It would be their moment of
glory; they would be doing their
bit for the “revolution." And yet
they and The Pitt News would
have us believe that the police-
men were entirely at fault and
that the demonstrators were the
innocent victims.

My heart bleeds.

Panthers through a dubious three
quarters in Saturday‘s Navy con-
test, is again sidelined, this time
with a twisted knee.

The injury is all the more signi-
ficant when it becomes known
that Hogan may have been deliv-
ered the decisive shot after the
whistle had blown.

“It was a deliberate blow," said
Coach DePasqua. "He was down
after the lateral and a Navy play-
er piled on. The referee refused to
call it." A '

Clean football was not the ac-
tivity of the day. DePasqua then
went on to indicate. “Joe Carroll
is limping around.” the coach
said. “He was hit out of bounds.
The play was over and a blocker
came over and hit him."

said. “We won about 11 of 17

Besides", being sold on the Ridl

their shooting accuracy from a 39

Scott's relative lightness for
his height brings on the danger of

the problem.

   DePasqua Cites Navy  
‘.[oul Play’ On Injuries

* 77. “ by JERRY MYERS

Carroll was suffering from a
charley-horse before the game
and the shot helped to aggravate
it.

Added to Hogan and Carroll is a
long list of injuries. Hank Alford
won’t know if he’ll be ready to
play until later this week. Jack

Dykes is out indefintely and De-

Pasqua said that the defensive
end’s return will be a result of
how quickly he responds to the
treatment he is now receiving at
West Penn Hospital.

The bright spot in the Panthers’
gloomy facade is the Ralph Cind-
rich story. Although the Pitt line-
backer didn’t play that much
against Navy, DePasqua was rel-

-atively pleased with his perform-

ance.

“Ralph had to play against
Navy or he’d be cold-duck against
West‘ Virginia," the coach com-
mented. “After the season is over
he’ll decide whether he wants to
have that leg operated on.“-

So the question is not how well
the players can prepare them-
selves mentally for the West Vir-
ginia contest, although that is def-
initly a factor. The question, as
DePasqua sees it, is how well in-
experience players face the pres-
sure of the game.

“Were playing with a lot of in-
jured people." he began. “and
that‘s where inexperience steps
in. West Virginia is an extremely
explosive team but I think we
have a slight advantage by being
the home team. It all depends on
how many players recover.

The injuries, taken as a whole.
cannot be attributed to any one
factor. The Panthers have faced
two teams in the past two weeks
that had ‘'blood‘‘ in their eye.
Both Kent State and Navy were
out to win, and, DePasqua indi-
cates, their determination lead to
things like'piling on and out-of-
bounds contact.

DePasqua does his best to live
with the situation. though, con-
cluding that "whenever you have
contact. you have injuries."

i Grove City Cancels
Due To °SunkeI1° Field

by MIKE MILLER
Soccer is a sport that is usually played under any conditions. no
matter how unfavorable. The Pitt booters. however, had the unique ex-
perience of being rained out of a match at Grove City College yesterday.

The soccer fields at Grove City were under water after four day ‘

of heavy rain.

Coach Leo Bemis felt that the cancellation will give the team much
needed time to prepare for Friday's match with Ohio University.

“We have to be psychologically ready for Ohio,” the coach stated,
“They have a very good ball club. Also we won’t have any injuries.”

The match will be re-scheduled for Oct. 27, at which time the

soccer men will attempt to prove
their superiority over Grove City.

“They never accepted our 1-0
victory over them last year as an
indication of who was the better
team, " said Bemis.

The coach now feels, however,
that he has a much better team
this year.

“The line play is better. We've
scored as many goals this year as
we had scored last ydar at this
time," he said.

The coach considers the main
improvements to be in the de-
fense. Their only flaw has been
the Akron game in which four
goals were scored against them.

That was the first game on the
booter’s schedule and Akron is
one of the most powerful soccer
teams in_ their conference. The
coach attributed the faulty de-
fense to the fact that the team was
not in top form that early in the
season.

The coach had been employing
a different defensive strategy ear-
lier in the season, but he felt that-

this was not the reason for im-
provement.

The new defense allowed the
booters to play a more offensive
game against very powerful
teams such as Akron. Bemis.
however, kept the old strategy in
reserve.

“We’ve used the 4-2-3 defense
in the last two games,” he stated.
“I didn’t exactly junk that. With

the personnel changes that we've."

had I_.though_that we could play a
4-2-4.”

Bemis intends to use the time
he has gained for practice scrim-
mages before meeting Ohi Uni-
versity on Friday.

Barnhart Stars

  As Frat MVP

(Editor's Note: Pitt Neyvs—intra-
mural writers" selected lM fMost
Valuable Players from thesottball
competition which recently con-
cluded. This is an article telling
about their fraternity selection. The
outstanding player from the dorm,
independent and grad-lac leagues

“Did you see that! Did you see
it! I told you, didn‘t I? I told you
he could throw,” explained a con-
fident onlooker.

What he sawland what the puz-
zled Delta Sigma Phi intramural

softballteam saw last week in a .

frat title game was an ordinary
occurrence in the shortstop play
of Ray Barnhart.

What had" just happened was
the throwing out of a runner at
first base by Delta Tau Deltas
Barnhart.

Why so much talk though?’ The
ball was hit in the hole. Barnhart
knocked it down, picked it up, and
threw to first. The throw just nip-
ped the runner.

From shallow left field, it was-
n’t a bad play. In fact, it was an
excellent play. It was not hard to
understand why Delta Tau Delta
was in the championship game.

It isn't hard to understand why
Barnhart has been chosen as the

Pitt News Most Valuable Player.-

RAY BARNHART
Frat MVP

“We have a good defensive
team. We were confident we could
come from behind. Besides. we
never got mad at one another,"
he said.

Barnhart didn’t choke when it
counted most. In the tight cham-
pionship game, he came through.
With the score tied at three, he
drilled a shot into the left-center-
field gap which eluded the out-
fielders for a two run homer and
a final 5-3 score. ‘

Barnhart thinks intramurals
are an important part in the life
of the Pitt student. “It gives stu-
dents a chance to‘ have fun wit

each other while being”, involved in

a constant plug at shortstop. he
batted a robust .615. seventh best
of all frat hitters.

Athletic competition is nothing
new in Barnhart’s life. He star-
red at shortstop on the baseball
team for three years at Peters
Township High, while also letter-
ing in basketball, football, and
track.

“It was a small school though,"
he added in an attempt to make an
excuse for his athletic ability.

Barnhart thinks highly of Pitt‘s
intramural program. “It's an
overall good program,". he states.
“There is room for improvement
though."

“In Notre Dame, they play tac-
kle football with ll men on a team
and they are fully equipped. I
would like to see that here.”

He also thinks that better field
conditions would help the intra-
mural program.

Barnhart looks forward to play-
ing football (the next intramural
 event) on‘a “nice grass field." He
also looks away from the stadi-
um. “AstroTurf may hurt some
of the players who aren’t in the
best of shape." he reasoned.

Wherever intramurals are play-
ed. though, you can expect to see
Barnhart on the football field and
the basketball court and running
track. And if he had his way, you
would see him playing tackle foot-
ball with 11 men on each side ful-
ly equipped.

by STEVE WILLIAMS

"Mad House is a Cinderella
team just like the Mets were in
‘69,“ remarked an umpire who
has watched them advance to the
All-campus championship.

And the Cinderella magic held
true for Mad House as they de-
feated a highly touted Grad-Fac
team, the Charlie Browns. 6-4.

The game even followed the
script of a Met victory; score a
lot of runs quick and hold onto the
lead with good defense and solid
pitching.

Mad House cashed in five runs
in the first two innings for a five
run lead after which they were
never headed.

A pair of singles from Tom Wil-
liams and Chriss Gross and a line
double off the hat of John Petrilli
resulted in a quick one run lead.

An error ‘of ommision on the
part of Charlie Brown pitcher Art

Parks led to one earned and three
unearned runs for Mad House in
the second inning.

Jack Tighe‘s single, Mark Ana-
tole‘s double and Bob Wilbur‘s
single yeilded the first and only
earned run of the inning.

While Wilbur’s hit was being re-
turned to the infield, Art Parks,
who caught the relay throw, never
thought Mark Anatole would try
to score from second on the short
single. But Mark never slowed up
and so shocked Parks that Parks
never made the throw to the plate.

Tony Preidis reached base on
an error followed by a walk to
Tom Williams, to load the bases.
Jerome Pigza smacked a solid
single to left which drove in Wil-
bur and Preidis for the final two
runs of the inning and the 5-0 mar-
gin.

Charlie Brown rallied for three
runs in the top of the third to nar-
row the margin to 5-3.

GOODLUCK

. Morris Turner singled and
Mark Obenrader rached base on a
error to open the inning. Bill Stez-
oski drove a ground rule double
down the rightfield which fortun-
ately for Mad House could only
drive in Turner from second.

Brian Bowles singled and John
Molinari doubled for two more
runs which was all they could
muster.

But in the sixth Herb Dank-
myer scored on Morris Turner‘s
double which would have been a
home run but for the fine cutoff of
the drive by Pigza. If the hit would
have been a home run the score
would have been tied five all and
the game might have turned out
differently.

In the bottom of the sixth, Jack
Tighe iced the game with a home
run to left for the final score, 6-4.

Mark Obenrader said. “We‘ve
faced teams with better hitting

spirit cause they beat us."

Many people said the Mets
combined a little bit of talent and
a lot of luck, but they won the
World Series it seems like Mad

House has used the same formu-  

la for victory.
