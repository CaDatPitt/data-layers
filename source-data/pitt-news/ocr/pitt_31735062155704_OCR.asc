Kurt Oster came to America
without skis. When he got a
scholarship to study in the
United States, an American
representative in. his home
town of I-Ielsinski, Finland, told
him he wouldn’t have a chance to
use his winter equipment in Pitts-
burgh. ‘ ‘

But the 31-year-old Finn has

-found time to sandwich in with

his studies, membership in the Ski

Club (he’ll have to rent his skis.)

Attends’ Brushing Party

Recently, Kurt accompanied the
group on a “brushing party” in
the mountains east. of Pittsburgh.
“It was very beautiful country,”
said Kurt.

Coming from a land of lakes
and forests, Kurt finds the ‘areas
around Pittsburgh a great contrast.
But that’s not the only difference

he ﬁnds.

In Finland, a tiny land 700 miles
long, with four million inhabitants,
the people are homogeneous, Kurt
explained. There are few foreign-
ers. In the United States, on the
other hand, are people from every
country on earth.

People Are Similar

“But there are more similarities
than differences,” the tall‘ Finn no-
ticed. “I was impressed by the
fact that people all over the world
have the same problem,” he said.

Kurt is studying industrial eco-
nomics (“how cost analysis is re-
lated to production”) at Pitt, ﬁn-
anced by a combination scholar-
ship. Travel expenses are provid-
ed by a Fulbright; the rest is based
on part of the war loan from the
United States to Finland during

' World War I, converted to schol-

arships during the Truman admin-_
istration.

Annual Stadium Review of the

L. Arthur, band director, this “in-
door extravaganza promises to be
an exciting two hours.” _

Featured in the program will be
popular American marches, popu-
lar jazz music and all previous
marching band routines from the
past football season. The marching
routines will be complete in all
details including actual marching.
The band will present special ef-
fects to create a realistic stadium
atmosphere.

Benny Benack, assistant direc-
tor and arranger of the Pitt Band,
will be featured on trumpet in
several selections. '

Highlighting the evening will be
the “Outstanding Bandsmen of

presented by Kappa Kappa Psi,

honorary Pitt band fraternity to

a bandsman selected by his col-
leges. I - -

Tickets at [special student rates
of 50 cents "are available at the
Student Desk on the ground ﬂooi‘

and also from band members.

A tour of the Grand Canyon and
a trip through the West Coast for-
ests are both on Kurt’s agenda be-
fore he returns to Finland.

Busy Guy

Here at Pitt, Kurt keeps himself
busy, and is kept busy. He be-
longs to the International Club,
the Ski Club, and, in his own
words, “As a foreign student, I
have many invitations to parties
and dinners with private families
and clubs.”

K_urt commented that Pitts-
burgh’s recent Indian summer
weather was like summer in Fin-
land. The weather is ﬁne, he ad-
mitted, but not too good for a
man whb has been skiing since he
was six.

Get the Air as Defense
Department Cuts Commissions

' Approximately 7,000 seniors nationally enrolled in the
A11‘ Force Reserve Oiﬁcers’ Training Corpsrwill not receive
commissions after graduation this year.

More than 125,000

young men‘ have enrolled in the

and in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.
Enrollment shows a decrease of
some 15,000 students "as compared
to last year’s enrollment of more
than 140,000 cadets.
Several Reasons Given

The decrease has been attribut-
ed to the Air Force's requirement
for the majority of cadets to take
ﬂight training followigg gradua-
tion and commissioning, and the
cessation of hostilities‘-in Korea.

Of 17,800 seniors enrolled ap-
proximately 2,100 will be commis-
sioned second lieutenants prior to
May. 1, and more than 8,000 will
receive commissions on June 1.

The remaining 7,000 seniors
cannot expect to receive commis-
sions and will be given Certiﬁcates
of Completion. These cadets be-
come eligible for the [draft after

graduation.
Have Alternative

However, at recent policy an-
nounced by t-he Defense Depart-
ment- allows these graduates to
enlist as Airmen Third Class for
a special two-year‘ tour of duty
in the Air Force. After the non-
commissioned graduate has dis-
charged his Selective Service ob-I
ligation, he may, if still qualiﬁed,
receive a reserve com-mission bas-
ed on his Certiﬁcate of Comple-
tion. . it
' ‘ This . far-"reaching change has
been made because national policy
reduced Air Force strength and
because of budgetary restrictions.
Under the previously planned 143
wing Air Force, all cadets enroll-
ed in the advanced course could
have been given commissions fol-

SC W‘ill EXercise ,
New Controls Over
Activities Chairmen

By IRV ROTI-IMAN _
Student Congress announced its new controls over
chairmen of all—school activities Monday. Under the new
policy committee chairmen for school dances, tap day, and
spring festival will be fully responsible to SC for actions

taken on any affairs.

At the meeting, the Appoint-
ments committee, headed by Lou
McCullough, urged the following
three-point system of .checks
which was passedby the solons.

First, two weeks after,appoint-
ments are announced ‘chairmen
must submit a detailed budget at
a regular meeting of Congress for
approval. Second, chairmen will
be requested to sit in on pertinent
SC executive committee meetings
for the duration of their particu-
lar activities. Finally, it will be
necessary for activities heads to
submit at least an oral report con-
cerning the progress of the affair
before the event and a completed
written report afterwards. None of
these have previously“ been re-
quired or program chairmen.

The ‘change has been made to
have a check against unnecessary
extravagance and chairmen who
could beneﬁt themselves ﬁnancial-
ly. Although no such disasters
have ever happened here, due to
reliable chairmen, the motion
would be more or less an assur-
ance against such recklessness.

According to Ross Reese, SC
president, chairmen in the past
have “owed nothing to anyone.”
He emphasized that past failures
of Pitt events can be mostly at-
tributed to a person’s assuming
too much responsibility himself,
and poor planning.

Reese also pointed out that the
chairman will have full say in
what he wishesto do, but the gov-
erning body will serve as a check.

The appointments committee
has also recommended a new sys-
tem of choosing positions for
dances or festivals. In all previous
appointments, chairmen, business

managers and publicity managers .

were all chosen at one session.
From now on, the chairman will
be chosen first. Then he’ll sit in
with the committee to decide the
other two positions. If that re-
vision works out as expected, then
there will be assurance of all com-
mittee heads working together
well. ,

Congress members feel the
changes will be to the advantage
of the Pitt student body.‘

Right Kind of Education

Last _weekend, nearly 70 top leaders of business and

education met in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia to‘

discuss and explore waysand means for the two ﬁelds to co-
operate in providing‘ more and better educational oppor-

‘ tunities for young people. Out of this conference came a

statement from Mrs. Millicent C. McIntosh, president of
Bernard College. Mrs. McIntosh called for “the—right kind
of education” that, ﬁrst of all, must‘ provide a sense of
proportion and history. ?‘A young man who has only 'tech-

: nical knowledge will have no understanding of the bene-

ﬁts of democracy. He will have no interest in defending

his country becausehe will have no idea of its uniqueness

or its place in history.’-.’ She added that education must give

--opportunities «for creative development and for “enrich-

ment of personality.” We would like to offer these state-
ments to a few of the people around here who believe that

education consists of sitting in a class room while facts

and ﬁgures are pounded into the mind and all else in the
University is a diversion that befouls true knowledge. May
we point ‘out that the free discussion of ideas, the exchange
of beliefs, the revolt against certain theories that-~have be-
come antiquated with time are part , and parcel of our
education. ,We would like to _add that -fraternities, ‘sorori-
ties, student activities, Tuck Shop bull‘-sessions, football
games and pep rallies, dances and parties, an‘d‘dates on Sat-
urday night are “beneﬁts of-democracy” Athatcontribute to

the knowledge, ability, and personality of ‘today’s students
who will someday assume roles as the leaders and follow-

ers of the world population. This, too, is education and God
help this world if we ever forget it.

We 're   5' till Trying  

_When we announced the contest to ﬁnd the best deﬁni-
tion for “school spirit” a few issues ago, we thought the re-
sponse would be appreci‘able—especially with “Doc” Carl-

son’s generous offer of $25 to the ‘winner. Well, we got
 several replies but it_ was certainly, a microscopic percent-'2
age_of the University enrollment. We have extended the

deadline on ‘tl1e',‘contest to November 25' in hopes that more

‘people will participate.__‘ If ‘there is no more response, the

winner will be adjudged from the entries now on hand
and announced in the next issue of the News, December 2.

A casual mention, of “girl

cheerleaders” in a Tuck , Shop ‘
booth the other day touched off
a long and heated debate on one

of those controversial issues that
seem to crop up every year, ﬂare
brieﬂy in the light of sudden in-

terest, .and ,

want of addi-
t i o n a 1 fuel.
Women cheer-

and just as
e n e rgetically
b 1 o c k e d by
other groups.

The arguments for and against the .

proposal are. generally the same
hackneyed phrases, showing lit-
tle changegfrom year to year ex-
cept for personal choice of ‘words
by ‘successive champions who
take up the good ﬁght.

The argument generally starts
out with‘ somebody saying: ,“other
schools have women ch-eerle-aders
so why can’t we?” The trouble
with the arguments given from
there on in is that they tend to
go off on tangents instead of
mulling that first» statement over
several.times.- That could be the
whole argument for introducing

0%

. femininity to the area immedi- ‘
-ately in front of the Student Sec-

tion. C _ ‘

We're Normal '"
Are we so vastly different from
other colleges, are our women

‘any less attractive, is the ‘very

idea of girls leading cheers so
unthinkable here that we should
not put some value in this state-
.ment? The argument that it is
not “ladylike,” or it is “degrad-
ing,” or “makes a, spectacle” of
the coeds, or is “high schoolish”
or any one of several similar
‘charges are utterly ridiculous.
Miami University of Florida,
Ohio University, UCLA, and a
host of other institutidns of high-
er learning have for many years
graced their stadiums with cute
young things who do not seem to
suﬁer any loss of dignity or re-
spect in carrying out their cheer-
leading duties. ,,
I -doubt very much if the uni-
versities have suffered any‘ loss

of prestige or received many.

complaints from. parents who are
said to resist the idea of their
daughter performing for the uni-
versity in a_ becoming skirt and
‘sweater. That argument is_ weak
and indicates a last gasping at-
tempt to win the case on per-
lsonal prejudice and a’ straight-
laced attitude that went out when
Annette Kellerman won approval
for her. functional bathing suit.

Oi-hercAlrgumenfs Weak

We can’t go along‘ with the the-
ory that the women here have no
desire to be_ cheerleaders now
that they are in college. Perhaps‘
some of the ex-high school cheer-

   
 
  
 

 Nofhing nLike la Dame    S '   Q:

leaders do not want to continue
their activities now; but if there
are enough at other colleges who
do not‘ want to ﬁll the jjranks,
there are certainly coeds /at Pitt

who enjoy the activity and would

be willing to participate. The
primly-given statement that the
girls would not be able to travel
to the away games with the male
cheerleaders and band members
will not hold water if it is re-
membered that the coeds do not
have to go on the tripsgor could
travel with other girls who are
attending the game. College
women are old enough that their
morals won’t be changed because
they are’ on their own nor can
society and propriety condemn
them for getting together in a

bunch for a visit to another col- *

lege campus.

For that matter, forget about
sending them to other than home
games. Our cheerleaders now
make few trips and then only to
neighboring schools where Pitt
will be well-represented and

there are many students making

the trip.

What we are striving for is the
sight of gyrating feminine ﬁgures
that somehow evoke a measure-
able amount of spirit from the
fans and give the girls a chance
to use their talent for the same

purpose and effect gained by-

having male cheerleaders. To
borrow a» phrase from “South

It's A Dulli Year-So Far

’By Dave Green

Phooeyli From the stzindpoint of a News Ed-
itor this is frustrating year. Nothing’s happening.
At this time last Fall it was tough ﬁtting all the

juicy plums on page on°‘e.; C .
3 By‘ this time 1a'st November the live panther
issue" had been killed and revived twice. The

, question of guest tickets at football games had

caused more than one barrage ’
between the
eighth ﬂoor politicos and the

athletic oﬂice, and the girl cheer-

burst. .

I Poorly attended pep rallies
almost cost the Student Corfgress
assemblies chairman his job, and
cries of “politics” were shouted
when he kept it.

Everyone In Hue Act  ,
The,Pitt News was accused of “trying to in-
timidate Men’s Council” in a hotly‘ contested in-
ternal election, and reverbrations of the _Notre
Dame victory rally were still "ringing in the ears
of the administration when SC was billed $137 for
“Commons Room destruction.’’ , l‘ «
Actiyity men quaked at the thought of a ﬁiint
‘scale system on activities; MC howled when,.....it
found it couldn’t spend its ,money on an orphans’
party. _ » > .
About the first of the year, the solons got around
to throwing out some of their members, while their
p'rexy_ charged that “Pitt politics -are as dirty as
they can get.” IF. Council_ in the meantime got

around to throwing out. its infamous election slate. ,

_ By VINCE LEONARD

John Petrolias, internationalist,
polyglot, and exchange student is
a 5’ 5” bundle of versatility mark-
ed down at Pitt as a sophomore
majoring in political science and
economics.

A college education might seem
to be anti,-climatic for the well-
versed John, but it is a stepping
stone he must hurdle before fur-
thering his career. John’s post-
college desire is to enter Greece’s
foreign service and spread good
will in the western hemisphere
on behalf of his country. _

Because he has a “tremendous
desire to transplant Hellenic cul-
ture in America,” John took the
job ‘of teaching the Greek lan-
guage and ways to Americans at
the Greek Community of Pitts-
burgh.

Call of the Skyscraper

Asked why he chose Pitt as the

place for his formal education, he

answered that the fable of the 42
story-high university beckoned
him in far-off Salonika, Mace-
donia, where he received most. of
his high. school training.

Although he didn’t ﬁnish school
there, he attended many foreign
language schools to gain his “poly-
glot" prestige. At the age of ten,
he attended the French College
and British Institute to learn
French and English, two of the
five languages he speaks. Later he
learned Italian and finally Span-
ish.

To further. stimulate his inter-
national activity, John has joined
the International Club of Pitts-
burgh. He says the club’s main
objective, the same asihis, is to
“bring__people of different cultures
together.” .

Hellenic Spirit of America

John, a student of ancient Greek
civilization, concludes that “Amer-
icans should understand the Hel-
lenic spirit, which to a certain ex-
tent, is continued in the great re-
public of the United States.”

Backin this home city Salonika,
John gained much of his interest

in politics from his father," Aris-—

tides, who is a lawyer in politics.
Mycenai and Tyrns, citieswhich
he studied in Greek civilization
are now only ruins,-while Salonika

is second to Athens as the most

important commercial city.

Visits United Nations

Speaking of big cities, John
traveled to New York two weeks
ago‘ to visit a United Ilations
meeting." This wasrfuel for John’s
international ﬁre. He was overjoy-
ed-to see the diplomats of so many
foreign countries assembled in one
big union, and marveled at the

Engle Develops Offense

By BEANO COOK '

When Bob Higgins was head coach at Penn State, the
Nittany Lions iivere noted for their strong defensive teams,
but since Rip Engle left Brown University to become the
boss at State, all this has changed. ‘ ‘ ‘

Penn State is now a team which scores and is scored
upon. During the last two years, only one team, Wisconsin,
has been able to prevent the pesky Lions from crossing the

completed 68 of 146 attempts for a
great 47 per cent and eight touch-
downs.
' Rados to Garrity
On the end of most of Rados’

"heaves this year has been Monaca’s

Jim Garrity, a fast right end who
is sev'en‘th in the country as a re-

ceiver and only six receptions

away from the State record.

With this duo as a passing com-
bination, plus the newly-developed
ground attack, big scores have
been a Penn State highlight this
fall. In fact, last week’s 56-24
pasting of Rutgers was the largest
rolledlup by the Lions since Engle
became coach in 1950.

Pitt counters with a sharp run-
ning attack which features bull-
dozer Bobby Epps, and hard-
charging halfbacks Ray Ferguson
and Dick'Manson. .

only six of them will be in uni-

goal line. During these two years,
Penn State has been able to shut

out only two teams—Pitt, 17-0,

and Nebraska, 10-0. .

The main reason Penn State has
been such an oﬁiensive threat is
Tony Rados, the artistic passer
from Steelton. Tomorrow’s game
against Pitt will be his last in a
Penn State uniform. However,
weeping Lowell “Red" Dawson is
hoping that Rados will have an
off—day, but this is very unlikely
since the Steelton Slingshot has
had two bad Saturdays in a row.

Garrity Stars

Although Jegse Arnelle always
plays his best game against Pitt,
it is Jim‘Garrity, a ﬁghting Irish-
man from Monaca, who has been
stealing the headlines this fall.
Garrity is a tremendous offensive
end and also does the extra point
kicking. But if Arnelle gets into
the game, Pitt rooters will imme-

diately recall Jesse’s outstanding,

performance two years ago when
he caught ﬁve passes, the ﬁnal
one for a touchdown. Last year,
Arnelle played his usually great
offensive game and, at the same
time, gave Captain Joe Schmidt
his roughest afternoon with dev-
astating blocking.

When the season began, Engle
was moaning about his running
attack. Although «Rip is still cry-

ing, Lenny Moore has made Engle \

very happy. Moore is a breakaway
runner and is dangerous up the
middle or around end. Against
Wisconsin, the Reading racer Went
55 yards for a touchdown but the
play was nulliﬁed because of a
penalty.

State Could  
Equal Record

RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

By

 

Last Tuesday someone brought up the question as to
whether Pitt has ever lost four games in a row to Penn
State and West Virginia competition. The questioner ob-
viously considered these last two years as the low points for
the Panthers in the Big Three standings, and was wonder-
ing how a loss tomorrow would stack up with the record
book. .

Well, Pitt really did lose four in a row 5
before. The unbearable situation occurred;
in the 1902 season when State won, 27-0, as
well as WVU, 23-6, and in 1903 when the
Lions gave Pitt a 59-0 lacing (the worst they 5
ever administered) and the Mountaineers
followed suit with the biggest margin they-
ever scored, 24-6. Things were rough in
those days. I -

Things could get just as rough again to-
morrow at the Stadium when Rip Engle’s "
squad of giants come out on the gridiron.
Pitt line coach Ernie Hefferle, who scouted them, says that
the Lions are as big a team as we’ll ever face. He also
reported that Roosevelt Grier, the 6-4, 240-pound tackle, is
practically immovable——a ﬁne pro prospect. And Hefferle
attributed Tony Rados’ low passing yardage against Rutgers
last Saturday not to ineffectiveness but to a desire to play it

 

= safe and Stick to the ground.

Many experts rate Rados as one of the top passers in
the nation, and a look at the statistics, in comparison with
Pitt’s throwing game, shows the huge advantage the Lions
hold in this department. They have piled up more than
a thousand yards wtih their aerial attack, while the Panther
tossing yardage totals up .to a mere 417 yards.

And even though Pitt is primarily a ground team, State
is fewer than 200 yards behind in rushing.

Statistics-wise, it appears as though we don’t have much
of a chance. But don’t be alarmed, tomorrow’s game is not
being played on paper.

beaten by four points by the sec-
ond-place Panthers.

Coach Carl Olson’s boys contin-
ued to add to their productive sea-
son of nine straight with their IC
4-A performance, the highest
they’ve placed in that meet since
1924 when the Panther squad won
the coveted title. Point getters in
the meet were Walt Starz, who

Dan Sommer 21st, Don DelliGatti

sons and used their “blanket ﬁn-
ish” (when four or more men tie

for ﬁrst place) effectively eight-

There are poles and there

There seems to be a certain
amount of confusion about the

Said sign says “Answer S.C,.

go about answering a pole and
when did poles begin putting

At any rate, questionnaires
