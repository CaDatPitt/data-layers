If students couldn’t already tell by
the mechanical din of drilling and
hammering on Fifth Avenue and
University Place, construction on

Mark A. Nordenberg Hall is ap-' A “ ’

proaching completion.

Although it mightnot be soon
enough for some quad residents who
say their sleep has been interrupted
by the building, Pitt’s Facilities Man-
agement Department conﬁrmed in
an email on Wednesday that con-
struction on Pitt’s. new freshman
dormitory is right on trackufor its
expected completion-Idate of July
2013. So far, workershave ﬁnished
construction onthe foundation,
structural frame, exterior facade,
roof and major infrastructure of
the dorm namedéafter Pitt’s 17-year

A chancellor. As of right now, crews

are working totﬁnish the installation
of mechanical, electrical and plumb-.

‘ ing systems in the building and are

ﬁnalizing the stud and drywall work
while beginning to put the ﬁnishing

touches on the project through plas— .

tering, painting and tile installation.

Between now and July, crews
still must complete several tasks.
Mechanical work on the top ﬂoor
of the building along with ﬁnishes
andelevator stonework need to be
accomplished before the dormitory
can open. Plumbing ﬁxtures, ﬂoor-
ing, heating units and elevators also
must be installed.

As he addressed a crowd that in-
cluded his friends, family and fellow
Board members, 2013 Student Gov-
ernment Board president Gordon
Louderback said he was reminded
of his 21st birthday.

“It was probably the single best
day of my life,” Louderback said of
his birthday one year ago.

For that birthday, Louderback’s

_ mother had carefully planned a

surprise party that included Loud-
erback’s immediate family as well as
members of what he referred to as
his Pitt family. On Thursday night,
as he faced both his families shortly
after being oﬂicially sworn in as SGB
President, Louderback sai he felt
right at home.

“One of the best parts about to-

night is how people inthis room make

me feel very comfortable,” he said.
About 70 people attended the
SGB. Inauguration Ceremony Thurs-
day night in the lower lounge of the
William Pitt Union. The ceremony
comprised a performance by Pitt
Men’s,Glee Club and speeches by
Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
SGB Elections Chairwoman Annie
Brown, 2012 SGB President James
Landreneau and Louderback, the
only returning member of the Board.
Amelia Brause, John Cordier,
Charles Bonge, Thomas Jabro, Mi-
chael Nites, David Rosenthal and Sar-
ahwinstonbecame ofﬁcial members
of the 2013 Board after Louderback
swore them in. The ﬁnal new member
of the nine-person Board, Sowmya
Sanapala, was unable to attend the
ceremony because she is currently
in Israel. ‘ ‘
Before swearing in Louderback,
Landreneau expressed excitement

about the new Board’s potential.

“I know that Pitt is lucky to have
a leader like Gordon on campus,” he
said.

Landreneau wished‘ the 2013
Board the best of luck and asked
Louderback to raise his right hand.
Louderback pledged to uphold his
duties as president and then took over
the podium to swearinthe rest of the
members, hugging each one after he
or she took the oath.

, Louderback also spoke about his
fellow Board members and the work
each one does both in and out of SGB.

Each member is involved with many

University programs in addition to
SGB, including fraternities and so-
rorities, sports teams and charity
groups.

‘Among Louderback’s support-
ers in the audience were his parents,

Colbert to
speak in  

Pittsburgh  
next Friday

The Pitt News Staff

Pitt students will ﬁnally have the
chance to join the “Stephen! Ste-
phen! Stephen!” chant. . F‘
Stephen Colbert, the host of
the Emmy—winning Comedy-‘Cen-
tral late—night show “The Colbert
Report,” will be speaking atithe
Carnegie Music Hall .on_]an'-I 18.
_In June, four Pitt engineering
students earned a visit from the
popular satirist for the University.
They did so by following a treasure
map included in Colbert’s ‘_‘Colbert
Super PAC Super Fun Pack” boxes,
which the comedian and politi-
cal commentator released in the
months leading up to the summer
of 2012_to help educate American

young adults on the ins and outs .

of campaign fundraising.

Tickets will be available today
at the ticket office on the ground
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union
at 10 a.m. Students can get two
tickets, but individuals will not
be granted admission to the event
without a Pitt ID. The Carnegie
Music Hall holds about 1,900
people.

Doors open at 1 p.m., arid the
event begins at 2 p.m. Following
Colbert’s speech, there will be a
Q—and—A session. After the event,
there will be a book signing.

Food, beverage, Video and au-
dio recording and photography
will be prohibited.

The event is being held by Pitt
and the Swanson School of Engi-
neering with the cooperation of
Pitt Program Council. I,

and Filoni Architects Inc. of Pittsburgh, will
house 559 beds for incoming freshmen within
its 10 stories. Pitt’s Student Health Center
and Counseling Center will also relocate to
the dorm when it opens its doors for the fall
semester, at which point they will merge into
the new Wellness Center, to be located on the
second ﬂoor of the building. On the ground

level of Nordenberg Hall — with street level .

access —— will be the new Student Health
Pharmacy.

Over the course of the building’s construc-
tion, the crew, which varied between 100 and
150 workers each day, faced several obstacles,

especially because of the project’s location in '

the bustling heart of Oakland.

“There were site constraints related to the
site being in a congested urban area, with not
much space for storage and assembly of mate-
rials,” the Facilities Management Department
said in an email.

The project closed down, and an agreement
had to be made with the administrators of
Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall to acquire
the necessary space for the building process.

“In order to build the project, the construc-
tion manager needed to close several lanes of
Fifth Avenue, and we hired a police oflicer ﬁill
time to direct traﬂicand ensure pedestrian
safety,”- the department added.

In addition to the extra concerns that the
location of the project created, the Facilities
Management Department explained that the
building’s Leadership in Energy and Environ-
mental Design certiﬁcation presented chal-
lenges as well.

An LEED certiﬁcation denotes thata build- ,

ing has been veriﬁed as ﬁtting green standards
by a third party.

“Oneof the goals of the project was to
obtain an LEED Silver Certiﬁcation designa-
tion from the U.S. Green‘ Building Council.
To achieve this, many criteria needed to be
fulﬁlled, from developing an energy-efficient
building to recycling leftover construction
materials,” the department said.

Pitt offered instruction on plans for the

  
 

building’s sustainability to the design and
construction crews. Open Field Design Inc.
of St. Louis, a ﬁrm that assists in the design
and construction of LEED certiﬁed buildings,
also contributed to the effort. 1
Freshman students whose sleepschedule
suffered because of the loud noises from the
construction site wish they had the option of
living in the new dorm. Freshman ﬁlm studies
major and Holland Hall resident Caroline Kelly
mentioned the disruption that the construc-
tion caused at the beginning of her stay at Pitt.
“For the ﬁrst couple weeks it would be so

hot in Holland, but we would close our win—"

dows because [the construction] was too loud
and it would just wake us up,” Kelly said.

Erin Harrington, an undeclared freshman
who lives in Holland Hall with her room fac—
ing the construction, admitted that the noise
caused a disruption earlier this week.

“[Wednesday] morning, they made the
worst noise. It’s not all the time, but every
once in awhile they do something weird,”
Harrington said. ' e i ‘

She also added that she feels envious of the
students who will live in Mark A. Nordenberg
Hall next year. -

“I heard the description, and it sounds re~
ally awesome,” she said. “I’m. jealous.” I

  CRIME TIP‘

The Pitt Police Department has recently received reports mat female
students have encountered some dangerous experiences while
- drinking at local bars. We have heard the following scenario: A female
student under the age of21 prwuces a fake ID to the bouncer at the
liont door of me bar and enters. The female student is intentionally T
separated ﬁom her ﬁiends or may be alone when shepurchases an
alcoholic beverage. She then has no recollection of events until the
next day when she wakes up the strange apartment with an
unknown male.
The purpose of this tip is to alen‘ other female students to be on guard
when socializing with alcohol. I

Nordenberg said to the outgoing Board.
He extended a welcome to the new and re—

turning members of 2013 Board, imention- .

ing that he hoped 2013 would be a rewarding,
if less exciting, year than 2012.

“To be elected to the limited number of
leadership positions that exist within student
government really is atestament to the qualities
of the ‘Board members,” he said. ‘

Landreneau also presented his farewell ad-
dress during the ceremony. He thanked the Pitt

community and administration members for t

the -mentorship ;and guidance provided him

during‘ hisitime in student government.

Landreneau named and reviewed a few ac-

Brown gave both the opening and closing
remarks for the ceremony, explaining the elec-
tion process for the 2013‘ Board.

“This year’s election was both exciting and
historic for the University,” Brown said, citing
an increase in voter turnout to 25 percent, up

' 6 percent from the previous year.

Brownconcluded the event by telling the
Board members that Pitt has high expectations
for their work.

The Board members celebrated after the
event and took pictures with the administra-
tion and each other. According to Louderback,
the inauguration came at the right time, as the
Board has already gotten to work and is gearing
up for a retreat this weekend.

“I’m happy to say that we’ve done about 16
hours of interviews for committee chair posi-
tions,” Louderback said.

The Board has been working since all of its
members returned to Pitt aﬁzer wintervbreak
and have selected the chairs for their commit-

tees and met with administration members to.

solidify plans for the upcoming year.

According to Cordier, the Board members
have already worked together to tie their proj-
ects together and open up lines of communi-
cation. ' ' Z .

Stalking isn’t what it used to be.
The task used to require memo-

and adult diapers, if you ‘were

Now you can ﬁnd out every-

clicks and a couple of minutes

weekend pictures every Sunday
night and Instagramming every
sunset (unlike grey, there are
onlyso many shades of pastel).

Definitely not as sinister as its
other, older use.

There is no shortage of me-

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers looking for second straight win

Eagles. Steve Garﬁnkel | For The Pitt News

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

Three days removed from a beatdown of
No. 19 Georgetown in the nation’s capital,
the Pitt men’s basketball team will receive
no respite as the Marquette Golden Eagles
roll into the Petersen Events Center on
Saturday afternoon, looking to remain
undefeated in 2013. _

Head coach Jamie Dixon’s Panthers
(13-3, 1-2 Big East) hope to even their

Redshirt iunior big man Taiib Zanna (4) nd hislteammates say th

   

Big East record after what has been a
sluggish start to conference play. Pitt
blew a second-half lead at home against
Cincinnati and came out slow on the road
against Rutgers. But the team’s perfor-
mance Tuesday night should serve as
the boost it needs to assert itself in the
conference.

Senior center Dante Taylor stressed
the need to play with sustained energy
against Marquette (11—3, 2-0 Big East).

“[We need to] come out and be more

ey needto maintain a high level of energy against the Golden

aggressive than them. They’re an aggres-
sive defensive team, so we just gotta come
out and match their intensity,” Taylor
said.

Marquette — chosen to finish onespot
behind Pitt in the conference’s preseason
coaches’ poll — has played its first two
Big East games markedly better than ex-
pected, knocking offa solid Connecticut
team in overtime and beating the Hoyas

WRESTLING

Match with 
Bloomsburg to

highlight Duals

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ” lVrz'ter

, When the wrestling team hosts the Pitt Duals

this weekend, a challenging conference op-
ponent awaits.

Coming off big wins against Cleveland
State and Clarion to start its Eastern Wrestling
League season, No. 15 Pitt will take its winning
streak into a match against the Bloomsburg
Huskies, a solid team with only one loss, which
came against No. 7 Missouri.

 * -Lock Haven, Bloomsburg, Eastern Michigan

" "a'n‘a‘Da\;Ia§briWnrrnak‘e"tHe tripto Pittsburgh

for the Pitt Duals, and the Panthers will face
off against all but Lock Haven on Sunday at
the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Huskies have three ranked wrestlers —
two of whom are set for a matchup_ against a
ranked wrestler from Pitt. These two meetings
will no doubt play a key role in determining the
dual’s end result.

At 165 pounds, Pitt’s No. 14 Tyler Wilgo.
will face Bloomsburg’s No. 16_]osh Veltre, and
heavyweight No. 8 Zac Thomusseit of Pitt is
set to take on the Huskies’ N o. 18Justin Grant.

This week in practice Pitt has focused close«
ly on preparing to take on the Huskies for the
obvious reasons. They’re a skilled team, and
as such, the Panthers’ goal to win its fourth
straight EWL title runs through them.

“I would say there is more preparation for
Bloomsburg because they are a solid team and
are always prepared when we wrestle them,”
redshirt junior R]. Tasser said. “Theirwrestlers
go hard all seven minutes, so it is importarﬁxy
for us to match their intensity from the start.“

With two additional opponents Sunday, it
comes as no surprise that head coach Rande
Stottlemyer will most likely be forced to rear-
range his lineup. '

“The coaches will probably try to get other},
normally not in the lineup some experience’
with dual meet competition,” redshirt senior
Matt Wilps said.

That said, the wrestlers aren’t focused on
the lineup or any changes that might be made
to it over the course of the meet.

“Our main focus is taking it to Bloomsburg
from the start of the dual without overlooking
anyone or any team,” Tasser said.

Wrestling three matches in a day challenges
the team, but it’s a necessary part of preparing
the Panthers for the NCAA tournament where
they will compete in multiple matches each day.

“It’s always nice to wrestle a tournameht
because duals don’t simulate the nationals,”

ff’ After falling to Seton Hall in its conference
opener, the Pitt women’s basketball team is

now winless in its last 18 games against Big
East opponents. ‘

The Panthers will have a chance to snap that
streak in their upcoming game against Villa-
nova, one of the conference’s hottest teams, on
Saturday at 6 p.m. _ ‘ -

The Wildcats (12-2, 2-0 Big East) come to
the Petersen Events Center looking to wintheir
fourth straight game this season and theirthird
straight against the Panthers (9-5, 0-1 Big East).

The last time the Pit women played host

to Villanova was during the ﬁnal game of the.

'1 2010-2011 regular season, inwhich the Panthers
~ surrendered an 11-point lead and eventually lost

    —-:~- ---~--» .._~. .- .,__  -,...._...,-. .--

That season, the Panthers won th‘eir"fo1—' 

.~ lowing game, a contest against South Florida
on Mar. 3, 2011. That victory —— a ﬁrst-round
matchup in the Big EastTournament — marked
the last time Pitt beat a conference foe.

— In order for Pitt to end its drought of Big
East success, it must try to put up points on

the conference’s second-ranked defense. The ‘

Wildcats have allowed just less than 49 points

per game this season, a byproduct of their op- ’

» ponents’ collective 34.6 ﬁeld goal percentage.
The stingy Villanova defense is led by se-
nior forward Laura Sweeney, who is averaging
nearly three steals and two blocks per contest
this season. Sweeney is also the team’s leading
scorer and rebounder and ranks amongthe Big
East’s leaders in ﬁeld goal percentage.
However, the Panthers feature a pair of much
more dangerous offensive weapons in juniorfor-
wardAsia Logan and sophomore guard Brianna
Kiesel. Both players average more points than

Sweeney, and Logan — after a 21-point, 10—re- -

' bound day against Seton Hall — has logged six
double-doubles so far. ' 6 ‘

‘ Logan could see another big day on the glass

againstVillanova,whichranks among the worst

conference teams in rebounding. Providence

Pitt faces in-state rival Vilianova Saturday
night. Huailei Wang | Senior Staff Photographer

is the only other Big East team with a negative
rebounding margin on the year. In Villanova’s'

past two victories — both coming against fel-
low Big East teams Cincinnati and DePaul — it
has managed to collect 76 boards against its
opponents’ 58. f
The Wildcats grabbed 18 more rebounds

‘against DePaul on Wednesday, marking their

best performance in the category this season. If
this is asign thatvillanova has started to ﬁgure
something out on the glass, Pitt could have a
diﬁicult time putting points on the scoreboard
Saturday. I l
Villanova has proventobe tough on the road,
notchingfourwinsinﬁve games, but Pitt enters
Saturday’s contest with a 7-2 record at home.
The Panthers will look to continue the home-
court successbypickingup theirﬁrst conference

MARQUETTE

in its most recent contest. Saturday will I

mark a week since the Golden Eagles’ last
game, which could prove to be an advan-
tage for Pitt.

Perhaps most impressively, head coach
Bu-iz Williams has maintained the school’s
high standard of play despite losing the
team’s top two scoring options from last
seasion, Darius Johnson-Odom (18.3
pointsper  and Jae Crowder,(17.5
points), to theprofessional ranksfjunior
guard Var_1de‘rBlue (_13.2 points per game) e
and juniorifgrward Davante Gardner (12.9
points) havedone an adequate job replac-
ing the stars’ production thus far.

3 With Marquette’s offensive tandem in
place —. withjunior Cadougan and Jamil
Wilson contributing — Pitt will need to
focus its efforts on the defensive end. To
limit the Golden Eagles’ success in the
interior, Pitt will need another superior
defensive performance from freshman
center Steven Adam_s,.who patrolled and
contrblled.the . painted area in his*26?
minutiesionlfthie ﬂoor;-Tuesday, an effort‘
highlighted by three blocks. S ‘

Although Adams mightvnot match up
with Gardner individually during the
game, his efforts will likely be necessary;
to aid redshirt junior Talib Zanna in the
post against the 6—foot—8, 290-pound for-
ward. With Gardner coming off the bench
for Marquette, also expect to see Dante
Taylor — arguably Pitt’s best p.ost de-
fender so far this season — marking him.

“Gardner is a guy they go through,”
Dixon said. “As soon as he comes in,
they’re going inside.” .

' Speaking of Pitt’s leading scorer, Zan-
na rebounded from a we-ak performance
against Rutgers (nine points on 4-8 shoot-
ing, one rebound) with an energetic effort
Tuesday, posting a game—high 15 points
and missing only two of his‘ nine shot at-
tempts on the evening.

The Panthers will need‘ another effi— A

cient offensive performance from Zanna

against one of the few Big Eastgteams with c

the size necessary to counter Pitt’s advan-
tage on the blocks. . ‘
Additionally, redshirt freshman Du-

_ randjohnson cited the need to “focus on
being aggressive” and keep the Golden ,

Eagles from getting out in transition for
easy opportunities.

“They like to get out in transition and
run a lot,” Johnson said. “We gotta just
make shots and not turn the ball over and
keepthem from getting out in transition,
hold them in the halfcourt, make them
score that way.” I

PITT DUALS

redshirt senior Zac Thomusseit said of the I

Midlands Championships, which took place
last month.

While the Pitt Duals isn’t a tournament, it
still allowsthe Panthers to work on preserving
energy throughout a day of wrestling.

‘ Pitt has been off for two weeks since wres-
tling at the Midlands Championships and
should be well-rested for its three matches
Sunday.

“Three dual meets in a row will be challeng-
ing, but nothing we can’t handle,” Wilps said.
“We will want to start the day of strong against
Bloomsburg and keep the momentum rolling.”

Undefeated in league play this far, Pitt faces Bloomsburg on Sunday. Claire Deahl | Staff
