5GB lakes stand on panhandlers

By Kevin Kramer
Staff Writer

In an attempt to protect students, Pitt’s
Public Safety is initiating a campaign to
remove panhandlers from the Oakland
area.

Members of Operation-Save-A-Life are
also trying to protect Pitt students, but in a
different way.

Dan Robinson, the operation’s director,
spoke at last night’s Student Government
Board meeting to make sure Pitt students
do not get the wrong perceptions of
homeless people.

“A lot of Pitt students have no idea
what people living on the streets go
through,” said Robinson. “You never hear

anything about homeless people in a good
way. Any media coverage is always nega-
tive.”

Part of the media coverage Robinson

 
   

SGB

was referring to was last week’s The Pitt
News article, “Not all panhandlers home-
less.” The article was based on a report
compiled by Rick Boyd, the director of
Pitt’s Public Safety.

The report focused on 30 panhandlers in

United we stand 

the Oakland area, and described them as
being dangerous, having criminal records
and many not even being homeless.
According to Boyd’s letter written to John
Devitto, associate vice chancellor for
business and finance, “These 30 people
account for a total of over 400 arrests and
753 criminal charges.”

In addition, the letter stated, “Of these
30 people, 21 have permanent homes and
only seven are actually homeless.”

While Robinson said he does not dis-
pute the fact there are some panhandlers
in Oakland who are not homeless, he said
it was irresponsible for Boyd to go into
any person’s personal background,
whether they have a criminal record or

“It is an exciting year to be a

over the Democrats.

“We have the right candi-

Cranmer.

Cranmer, who is not running

Assault a problem on
campus, author says

By Kathleen Scanlon

Senior Staff Writer

Many victims of sexual assault never report the inci-
dent to police or university officials because “they some-

times think that it isn’t going to do any good,” according
to Carol Bohmer, co-author of “Sexual Assault On
Campus.” .

These fears can spring from the response of officials to
reports in the past. When university officials don’t
respond to reports of sexual assault quickly, victims often
drop out of school “because they feel very uncomfortable
on campus,” Bohmer told The Pitt News.

Following a report of sexual assault, university officials
should attempt to protect both the alleged victim and
defendant(s), Bohmer said. “Often  universities are so
concerned about protecting one side, they forget about
the other.”

As long as there is enough evidence to have a hearing,
there is enough evidence to prompt a reorganization of

, housing arrangements and other actions that would limit

the amount of contact between the victim and
assailant(s), she said.

This would help universities to “clamp down very hard
on an" ‘..F'id of harassment,” Bohmer said. Sometimes
friendsof the defendant(s) will call the victim on the
phone or make comments when they see the victim on
campus.

If allegations are proven to be true, “there should be a
range of punishments available, including expulsion,” she
said. In the courts, sexual assault is a criminal offense and

JERUSALEM — Israel’s

or two toward peace with the

grand a gesture as a meeting
with Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.

College students across the
country may be receiving
grades they don’t deserve
because some professors
aren’t allowed to fail their stu-
dents.

Schools such as Brown
and Oberlin
College, in Ohio, use grade
inflation, a name given to a
system that doesn’t allow stu-
dents to fail.

The lowest grade a student
can receive at Brown is a C,
and at Oberlin students can’t
get anything less than a C
minus.

In a June 4 The New York
Times article, other aspects of
this system were reported.
Students are sometimes
allowed to drop a class at any
time before the last day of the
semester, repeat courses for
better grades and take courses
pass/fail. If they fail the
course, then records that they
took the course are removed.

Hard to believe? Many stu-
dents at Pitt find problems
with this system too.

“If you give kids leeway
they’ll take advantage of it,”
said Mindy Barr, a junior
majoring in occupational ther-
apy.

Is this system fair to stu-
dents who work hard for their
grades no matter what the
grading system?

“If I worked really hard for a
grade and someone else got
the same grade as me just
because the teacher cou1dn’t
fail them, I would be upset. It
doesn’t seem fair, and the
grade wouldn’t be as valuable
to me,” said Mary Thomas, a
sophomore majoring in

English literature.

Some Pitt professors agree
with the students.

“I wouldn’t like a system
like that. If I'were teaching at

At one college, the percent-

"‘The University of Pittsburgh gives students the option to

take a course and not receive an A through F grade. Instead

they can receive an S grade for satisfactory.”

— Peter Moshein, assistant chair of the psychology department

consider leaving that institu-
tion,” said Patsy Sims, assis-
tant professor of English.

Some don’t even see the
need for such a system.

“The University of
Pittsburgh gives students the
option to take a course and not
receive an A through F grade.
Instead they can receive an S
grade for satisfactory,” said
Peter Moshein, assistant chair
of the psychology department.

But there may be a good rea-
son for this system. In a
Glamour magazine poll, one
student at Stanford University,
which just reinstated the fail-
ing grade, explains what stu-
dents will miss out on with the
inflation grade system gone.

“[With the return of the fail-
ing grade] we have to pay
more attention to what we’re
learning. Unfortunately, peo-
ple will be less likely to
explore new subjects because
they’ll be worried about their
grades,” said Jane Skillman,
junior.

Another plus on the side of
the grade inflation system, is
the higher percentage of As
and Bs.

In The New York Times arti-
cle, higher percentages of As
and Bs were reported at uni-
versities with this system. At
Stanford University when they
had the grade inflation system,
the percentage of As and Bs
was 89 percent. At Arizona
State University, which has an
A through F system, the per-
centage of As and Bs given

age of grades doesn’t apply
because students don’t receive
them.

At New College of the
University of South Florida,
students receive no letter

work from faculty sponsors.

Although this sounds too
good to be true, one student at
that college recently told
Glamour magazine why she’d
rather have grades.

Grade Inflation debated across the United States-

“Not having grades makes
things tougher. The teachers
give you detailed evaluations.
It’s like getting a report card
telling you what you need to
improve,” said Amy Stultz,
senior.

What if this system were
implemented at Pitt?

“I don’t think it would work.

Maybe at better schools like g

Stanford and Brown it works
because the students are so
smart to begin with, and the
faculty doesn’t have to worry
about the students not getting
their work done or not trying
their hardest,” said Barr.

Cranmer said his goal is to
broadcast an advertisement
over the radio announcing that
Republicans used to be out-
numbered, and this is not the
case anymore — finally there
is a two-party system in
Allegheny County. ~

“This is a demanding job.
Allegheny County is inhos-
pitable to Republicans,” said
Cranmer. “But the nature of
the city has changed.”

According to Cranmer, in
the 1930s the county was
mainly made up of
Republicans, but it changed
into a Democratic area almost
over night.

The government is designed
to work as a two-party system
at national,’ state and local lev-

els, according to Cranmer.
Finally, Allegheny County’s
statistics show that a
Republican Party exists.

The College Republicans’
next meeting will stress rally-

.ing the conservative party on

campus, according to CR Vice
President Jarrod Caruso. The
meeting will be Nov. 7 in
Room 106 of David Lawrence
Hall.

“The next meeting will be in
response to the [Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance’s] com-
ing out of the closet day. We
want to get people out of the
conservative closet,” said
Caruso.

“Too many people are afraid
to come out and speak conser-
vative ideas. Conservatives
have a bad reputation of

being intolerant, homophobic

white guys, and we want
to put an end to that stereo-

type.”

“That would be like us
doing a study on the students.
I’m sure there are students at
Pitt with criminal records,”
Robinson said.

Though Robinson and other

organization spoke to Pitt’s
SGB to change student’s per-
ceptions of homeless people,
SGB president Ross Pasquale,
in his letter to Boyd, said,

“The SGB supports the
Department of Public Safety
in its mission to keep Oakland
safe from crime.”

Public Safety Chair Patrick
Catena said he commends
public safety for taking the
initiative with the panhan-
dlers, and wants to take fur-
ther action to resolve the
problem.

He said the initiative was
taken because students have
been complaining of being
harassed by panhandlers.

“Students are honestly
frightened,” Catena said.
“Panhandlers get in their faces
and sit next to the MAC
machines. Students are afraid
to take their money out
because they fear what these
individuals may do.”

Though Pasquale, in his let-
ter, mentioned that the SGB is
directing its Governmental
Relations Committee chair to
assist Public Safety in taking
action against panhandlers, he
also provided information to
Pitt students on how they
could provide services for the
homeless.

The charity organizations
include: the Urban League of
Pittsburgh located at l
Smithfield Street in
Pittsburgh; Rainbow Kitchen
in Homewood at 144 E. 8th
Avenue (464-1892) and
Duncan & Porter House at
1332 Sheffield Street in
Pittsburgh (231-2766).

In addition to these organi-
zations, Robinson mentioned
that Operation-Save-A-Life
invites all Pitt students to vol-
unteer services to homeless
people in Pittsburgh by hand-
ing out blankets, foods and
other goods. He said the orga-
nization travels the streets
every night, and for more
information students can call

results in a prison sentence.

In the case of gang sexual assault by
members of a fraternity, Bohmer said she
supports revoking the fraternity’s charter
or putting the fraternity on social proba-
tion.

“Those are very powerful tools,” she I

said. “If you do that, then you send a
message to the fraternities that [the uni-
versity] cannot condone  or tolerate this
behavior.”

In cases in which the alleged victim has
been drinking alcohol, they may not

I report a sexual assault because they

might think “that because they were
drinking, it was their fault and therefore
they can’t do anything about it,” Bohmer
said.

But, in court, “being intoxicated  is
not a defense [for the assailant],” Bohmer
said.

“In some states, if you take advantage
of people intoxicated, then that’s rape.
because the person was not available to
consent,” she said.

Alcohol often plays a role, along with
peer pressure, in gang sexual assaults.
Gang assaults also often occur where
males live together, according to “Sexual

Assault On Campus,” written by Bohmer
and Andrea Parrot of Cornell University.

From 1980 to 1990, 55 percent of gang
rapes on college campuses were commit-
ted by fraternity members, 40 percent by
members of team sports and 5 percent by
men who didn’t belong to any kind of
organization.

Fraternity leaders should realize they
are “tremendous role models for younger

people,” Bohmer said. Gang assaults will .

continue in fraternities if these leaders
“show by their behavior that this is some-
thing that is appropriate  or valued,”
Bohmer said.

Post mid-term advice

Well it’s that time of the year again. The semester is about
half over, mid-terms are winding down and stress levels are
at their highest (until finals roll around that is). With this in
mind, The Pitt News is providing for its readers a quick “post
mid-terms advice list.” So freshmen listen up, we’re only
going to say this once.

1. Get some sleep. If you are like a lot of us here at The
Pitt News, sleep has not been a big priority the last couple
of weeks (months?). Although college life is often more con-
ducive to a highly erratic sleep schedule, it is wise to at
least get enough sleep on a regular basis, rather than “playing
catch up” on the weekend or just waiting until you crash.
Oftentimes, that crash may come at a very bad time, such
as in the middle of the test you stayed up all night studying
for. O

2. Stress relief. This is probably unnecessary advice for
most college students, but there are some of you out there
who take things a little too seriously. Remember all work and
no play makes Johnny a dull boy. It also can mess up
Johnny’s academics. Studies have shown that work balanced
by free time is essential to a healthy and successful life.

3. Startulooking ahead to next semester. Yes, registration
starts next Monday, Oct. 31, and this Thursday, Oct. 27, for
seniors. If you have not talked to or made arrangements to
see your advisor yet, then it is probably a good idea to do so
now. Also, make the trip to Thackeray to pick up course
selection guides (it is next to Soldiers and Sailors and across
from the Book Store, for any freshmen who haven’t been
there yet) and start looking through them.

4. Don’t skip class. The most empty classrooms of the year
are right after mid-terms. But just because you do not show
up, does not mean that the teachers stop teaching. Professors
love to put material taught directly after mid-terms on finals.

5. Start those papers now. Professors also love to sneak in
papers right after mid-terms, giving students plenty of time
to get them done before finals roll around. Of course students
often completely forget about said papers until finals actually
do roll around and, well you can figure out the rest.

6. The over—confidence factor. Just because you may have
gotten a good grade on your mid—term, don’t think your home
free. For mostplasses the majority of your grade comes post-
mid-term. So don’t get cocky.

7. The “Oh God I’ve failed” syndrome. This is the exact
opposite of the “over—confidence factor.” Just because you
may have gotten a not-so-good grade on your mid-term, it’s
not over yet. Remember the majority of your grade is still to
come, so you can pull your grade up though hard work and
dedication. Don't give up.

8. Last but certainly not least, don’t stop reading (or for
some of you start reading)! The easiest way to an A is by
keeping up with your studies.

Well that about covers it. Good luck to all.

I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Animal  Association for Laboratory vandalism

“Virtually every major med-
ical advance for both humans
and animals has been achieved
through biomedical research
using animal models,” accord-
ing to former U.S. General C.
Everett Koop.

Therefore, as a biomedical
researcher, I was dismayed to
read a front page article in the
Oct. 18 issue of The Pitt News
about a protest by Students for
Ethical Treatment of Animals
at the annual meeting of the
American Association for
Laboratory Animal Science.

The story was clearly lack-
ing an opposing viewpoint
which is essential for objec-
tive journalism, particularly in
regard to a controversial issue.
such as animal rights. A
protest against AALAS is par-
ticularly distressing consider-
ing that AALAS is most con-
cerned with providing for the
welfare of research animals
and promotes for animal care
far beyond those required by
the USDA.

In fact, AALAS is made up
of the technicians and veteri-
narians who provide for the
welfare of laboratory animals
and provide oversight to
researchers using animals,
assuring that the highest stan-
dards are maintained.
Unfortunately, groups such as
SETA and their national par-
ent organization PETA are
intent on ending the use of all
animals for all reasons, not
just in research. So—called ani-
mal rights groups undermine
the importance animal
research has achieved and has
yet to achieve.

SETA

I was extremely upset by an
article appearing in Tuesday’s
The Pitt News on SETA’s
protest of the American

Animal Science meeting here
in Pittsburgh.

This absolutely one-sided
portrayal of the issues sur-
rounding animal research mis-
represented scientific research
in a number of ways, but I was
particularly struck by the
repeated claim that scientific
research is carried out in
secrecy.

Academic scientists do not
do their work for their own
consumption, but to contribute
to our (humanity’s) under-
standing of our world and our-
selves.

Thus, an essential part
of science is the publication
of very detailed reports of sci-
entists’ actions and observ
ations, including descriptions
of the treatment of any ani-
mals used in their studies.
These publications are avail-
able to anyone who is willing
to take the time to go to a
library.

In the article Glenn Grodin
was quoted as saying that
often scientists do not publish
papers for years. In the
cases in which this is true, this
is not due to any desire for
secrecy, but rather because of
the time—intensive nature of
the experiments the scientist is
trying to perform.

Science is a “publish or per-
ish” field, and anyone who
thinks otherwise should talk to
a scientist who is an active
researcher in any field.

If someone wants to know
what a scientist does, he or she
should not assume it is
a secret. Rather, he or she
should simply ask some
one who has dedicated
his or her life to cleverly
uncovering the answers to
some difficult but intriguing
puzzles —- I am sure that you
will hear more than you want
to know.

This past week I have seen _

several acts of “gay vandal-
ism.” However, I do not feel
the acts are ﬂaunting their sex-
uality. In regards to National
Coming Out Day, the mes-
sages on the walls were there
to catch the attention of those
who passed by, and cause
them to think about it. I do not
believe that this should
be labeled as graffiti or van-
dalism, because of its imper-
manence. But perhaps they
could have used a more taste-
ful way of doing so, such as
posters.

Also, I don’t believe that
homosexuals are trying to
“annoy” any part of the stu-
dent body. Many of them have
felt intimidated at one time or
another because of fellow het-
erosexuals staring of obvious
disapproval. Homosexuals are

‘ regular people and shouldn’t

be treated as anything else.

Although their ways have
been shoved under the carpet
for so long, many feel very
strongly that they should be
actively voiced and accepted
into, society (which they
should). Why should any het-
erosexual be annoyed or
inﬂamed at another student for
“Coming out of the closet?”
This is equally as discrimina-
tory as racism in my eyes.

Finally, I believe that hetero-
sexuals and homosexuals are
all human. Why, if one part
has been quieted for so long,
should one push for accep-
tance? Disregarding topics
such as this only leads to igno-
rance, and this material is not
suited for bathroom walls. All
people should read topics such
as this with an open mind and
respect. Therefore, I disagree
with the last inquiry that said
that the “vandals” should be
punished. Perhaps, a pat on
the back is in order.

and cons of what, if passed by

Congress, will be the largest trade
agreement in history. Besides the
United States, about 80 percent of the
member nations have as of yet failed
to ratify the GATT agreement. No
doubt many of those nations are wait-
ing for the United States to take the
lead.

GATT negotiations began seven
years ago under the Reagan
Administration and have been pur-
sued by both the Bush administration
and now by President Clinton. If all
goes according to plan, GATT will
become the World Trade
Organization on January 1, 1995, and
will include 123 nations which
account for nearly 97 percent of
world trade. There are, however, two
nations which, as of now, are not
included in GATT or the soon to
be founded WTO ——- China and
Russia. China has been lobbying for

admission into the WTO, but it is
unlikely that it will gain admission
for another year or so because it has
yet to meet some of the entrance
requirements. _

The advantages of the passage of
GATT are obvious. It will lower
world trade tariffs 30-40 percent
which amounts to a reduction of $740
billion over 10«years (The New York
Times 9/30/94) and could add as
much as $100-200 billion to the U.S.
economy annually. President Clinton
has said of GATT, “It’s the biggest
worldwide tax cut in history by
reductions of tariffs. It will give us
300,000 to 500,000 new high-wage
jobs in the next few years.” ,

Despite these advantages and the
fact that the U.S. economy is undeni-
ably interlinked with the world mar-
ket, there are plenty of critics. As was
the case with NAFTA, it is mostly a
motley crew of ultra-protectionists,
labor activists and environmentalists.
The protectionists are led by Ross
Perot and Pat Buchanan, who say that
GATT will lead to the erosion of U.S.
sovereignty. Ralph Nader and the
environmentalists are whining about
everything from lowering of _the food
inspection standards to child labor
and massive urbanization.

Their common argument is that the
United States cannot compete against
the low-cost labor of the developing
countries and, as a result, the United

States will lose manufacturing jobs.
They’re right about the United States
losing manufacturing jobs, but
this will happen whether Congress
passes GATT or not. This is just
part of the transition of economic
development where more and more
jobs will be white collar and high-
tech.

The days of America being a blue-
collar nation are fading rapidly. It is
simply absurd for these people to be
blaming other ‘nations for our prob-
lems. If in the future America is
unable to compete and retain its num-
ber one position in the world, it will
not be as a result of any trade agree-
ment. It will be because of a crum-
bling public education system and a
splintering of this country along
racial lines.

Despite this economic transition the
United States still led all nations in
trade in 1993 with 12.6 percent of
world exports and 15.3 percent of
world imports. Germany was second,
and Japan was third (“Nightline”
10/4/94). Despite America’s ability to
compete, there are many Democrats
in Congress who are admantly
opposed to GATT. The number one
critic is Senator Hollings of South
Carolina who is trying to deceive the
American people by saying that he
only has America’s best interests in
mind by opposing GATT.

In reality, he is only trying to pro-

tect textile companies in his home
state from foreign competition, name-
ly from Asia and Latin America. He
is staunchly opposed to the reduction
of tariffs for U.S. companies because
he says it will hurt the competiveness
of America.

This is nonsense, but is expected
from a man who three years ago
boasted of America’s dropping of the
atom bomb on Japan by saying that
“you should draw a mushroom cloud
and put underneath it, ‘Made In
America.”’ This protectionist still
hasn’t come to grips with the reality
of life in the 1990s.

The facts clearly show that GATT
will be good for world trade and good
for the U.S. economy. President
Clinton has two very important eco-
nomic summits coming up in the next
several months‘ — the first in
November is the Asian Pacific
Economic Cooperation Summit in
Indonesia and the second in
December is the Summit of the
Americas in Miami, which brings
together leaders from North
American, Latin American, and
Caribbean countries. It is imperative
that America take the lead in world
trade, and Congress can assure this
by the passage of GATT early next
year

Breaking the law

A milestone event occurred
on the University of
Pittsburgh campus on the
night of Oct. 18, an event
that also happened to be a
felony. It involved Earth
First! activist Robert Hoyt,
labor activist Anne Feeney
and a large group of campus
environmental activists and
members of the community.

The event involved more
than just learning about what
is happening to American
public lands in far away
Idaho. It involved more than
singing along to some great
songs sung by Hoyt and
Feeney.

It involved more than “con—
spiring to interfere with the
legal [sic]- harvesting of tim-
ber.” It involved more than
helping to save endangered
species like the grizzly bear,
grey wolf and Chinook
salmon from certain extinc-
tion at the hands of the U.S.
Forest Service and the timber
corporations. This night sym-
bolized the common struggle
that environmentalists and
union workers have, and
drove home the point that we
must face the common
enemy together.

That common enemy is the
multi-national corporate
structure that is driving our
economy into the ground. In
this age of corporate cut-
backs and government cor-
ruption, labor movements
and environmentalists must
once again join forces and
work to make the world a
better place to live, not just
for humans, but for all
species. Breaking the law

was never so much fun.

Stand up

Once again alcohol rears its
ugly head, leaving behind
only (pain and anger.
Specifically, I am referring to
the sexual assault that
occurred last month at the
Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)
house. This is not an isolated
incident, though. It will be
repeated over and over again,
probably several times a
week, in the the university
community.

Most of the assaults will
never be reported. In a recent
survey, 32 percent of Pitt stu-
dents said they had unintend-
ed sex after drug/alcohol use.

Alcohol plays a major role in

the crime committed in the
university community. So
many students fail to see
alcohol for the drug it is. For
The Pitt News to claim that
after drinking a person is less
responsible for their actions
(editorial Oct. 18, 1994) is a
disgrace. Only by making
people responsible do they
act responsibly.

Ask the families of the
20,000 people killed by
drunk drivers last year who is
responsible. (note: 45 percent
of Pitt students have admit-
ted to driving under the
influence.) It is time for Pitt
to take a serious stand
against alcohol.

The Department of Public
Safety must be given the
resources they need to
enforce alcohol—related laws.

LETERS TO THE EDITOR

Fraternities that are in reality
drinking clubs catering to
minors must be disbanded.
Bars that allow minors in
must be shut down. Students
should stand up for their rights
(ever listen to your drunken
neighbors party until 3 a.m.?)
The time has come to make a
stand. Pick your side.

Handlers pan

Forbes Avenue, or any other
part of the city for that matter,
is not the exclusive domain of
any singular group. Oakland
does not belong to Pitt stu-
dents any more than it does the
homeless people, businessmen

and shoppers who fill
its streets daily. No one,
including the Student

Government Board, has the
right to force people off of
these streets to spare students
from the “annoyance” and
“eyesore” of panhandling
which is the reality of life in
urban America.

In the two years that I have
gone to school and even
worked nights in Oakland, I
have never been harassed or
attacked by any homeless per-
son.

Yet, I have had personal
belongings and books stolen
from within university build-
ings. I have also been racially
and sexually harassed by
“young, large, aggressive and
imposing” Pitt students, espe-
cially from the bar crowd on
Forbes.

Strangely, Wednesday’s

opinion column didn’t com-
ment on the number of “petty
crimes”- and serious offenses
committed everyday
in Oakland by university stu-
dents. This is definitely a
much more pressing issue for
this campus to confront.

Obviously, I cannot justify
the existence of crimes of the
homeless (through those com-
mitted by Pitt students.
However, there is no need
to justify the presence of
homeless people in the
Oakland area. Just because
students pay to attend a uni-
versity in this neighborhood
doesn’t mean that they have
the inherent right to dictate
who can and cannot roam the
streets.

Panhandling is a problem
that cannot be relocated for the
benefit of‘Pitt students who
would like to ignore its exis-
tence. And with each new anti-
panhandling ordinance, the
desperation of the homeless
becomes worse.

Maybe you don’t like see-
ing the same person asking for
money every day, but what
will he be doing to get that
money when you don’t see
him? Such policies never
“clean up” any area. They only
create higher concentrations in
more remote neighborhoods
which eventually spill into the
population at large, more
volatile than they were at the
outset.

BiGALA

On behalf of BiGALA and its
members, I am deeply disap-

pointed with Eric Owens’
coverage of our National
Coming Out Day meeting
which covered very emotion-
al issues dealing with coming
out’.

These are something that
we take very seriously and
do not want the entire cam-
pus to know our personal
lives. There should not have
been the use of our names.
Now, I have people feeling
sorry for me, which I do not
appreciate.

I am only going to say that
I have yet to judge The Pitt
News on its actions, please
don’t give me reason to
do so. In the future I hope
that you will respect the right
to privacy, or at the very least
ask before you print. Don’t
abuse the power of the pen.

I just wanted to let
you know that I am not
a very happy person now that
everybody knows my family
situation. That information
was given to BiGALA
members, the closet cases
who are afraid of coming
out.

It was simply meant to let
people, other gays, know
what it was like for me to
come out. I did not expect to
wake up one morning to find
my name in the article and to
have fellow students and fac-
ulty approach me and tell me
how sorry they are about my
family.

Please conduct yourself as
a professional newspaper
rather than a tabloid in the
future. Thank you very
much.

Temple is

faces

 

Temple on
Saturday, the
game will be
an indication
of how things
are beginning
Columnist to change for
Keith both teams.
Pompey Traditionally,
the Temple contest has been a
joke for Pitt fans.
In the 24 years that these

teams have played one another,
Pitt has 18 victories, 5 losses
and 1 tie.

But a year ago, both teams
were battling to get out of the
cellar of the Big East football
conference.

Going into that game, Temple
was a dismal 1-9 and Pitt wasn’t
much better with a 2-8 record.
Thanks to Curtis Martin’s 80-
yard touchdown scamper, the
Panthers edged out the Owls 28-
18. I

But so far this season, Owls
(2-5 overall, 0-3 in the Big East)
look a little better, while Pitt (1-
7, 0-4) might be worse than last
year.

Although only one game
divides these two teams, the
Owls are coming off of a confi-
dence builder, which might
decide the outcome of this
weekend’s contest.

Despite losing 49-42 to
Syracuse last weekend, Temple
scored 21 points in the fourth
quarter.

Pitt, on the other hand, is com-
ing off a 45-7 loss to Virginia
Tech, which didn’t do much for
its confidence.

To make matters worse, when
the Panthers faced the
Orangemen on Oct. 8, they were
embarrassed 31-7.

While the Orangemen praised
the Owls for their comeback,
they kept telling people the
Panthers were Pitt—i-f—u-l.

One reason why Temple, a
school without any football tra-
dition, is gaining respect in the
Big East is Hemy Burris.

Burns, a sophomore quarter-
back from Oklahoma, is one of
the best athletes in the confer-
ence. So far this season, he has
thrown for 1,773 yards, ranking
him first for total offense in the
conference.

The 6-foot-1-inch, 175-
pounder broke his own school
record against one of the best
teams in the Big East. In that
game, he threw for 392 yards
and four touchdowns against the
Orangemen. But while the Owls
are content with their signal
caller, who averages 253 yards a
game, the Panthers have had a

Pitt hockey ready to skate into season

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Hold it. Stop what you’re
doing. Can you feel that?

It feels a little colder,
doesn’t it? Well, it must be
that time of year again.

You know what I mean.
You know what’s right
around the corner.

Oh, it’s beginning to look a
lot like  Pitt hockey.

That’s right, people. With
no immediate end to the
National Hockey League
owners’ lockout in sight,
there is only one game in
town for the puck-hungry
masses, and the boys in blue
and gold are happy to accom-
modate. '

After a disappointing end
to a strong 1993-94 season,
the Panthers are hungry for
another shot at the league
crown.

With the kind of offseason

that the Pitt club has had,

however, that task appears
difficult indeed.

“We lost a lot of leadership’

and speed,” hockey club

 president Matt White said.

we’re just not cohesive.”

Division I and lost to
Carnegie Mellon in the
league semifinals. Gone is
nearly the entire defensive
corps.

Last year, Scott Giordano
was the heart to Tony
Trovato’s soul in Pitt’s
defensive scheme.

“Gordy” was the human
interpretation of a battering
ram in front of the Panther

net in ‘93—’94.

Giordano's gift of keeping
opposing forwards out of the
crease and clearing loose
pucks around the Panther
goal made his importance to
the club immeasurable.

Trovato had speed to rival
anyone in the league, which
made him an invaluable asset
when it came to chasing
down stray pucks and streak-
ing wingers.

Check out a Pitt basketball
game on television, and before
the game you’ll see a bunch of

plays highlighting the best in

the Big East. .

Right in the middle of those
highlights, a Pitt guard ﬂies in
from the foul line, grabs a
rebound and crushes the ball
through the hoop, in the
process of flying over two
Boston College players.

He pumps his fist at the
ecstatic crowd of Pitt fans and
runs back down the court.

That’s former Pitt basketball
player Darelle Porter. At Pitt he
was a high-ﬂying versatile bas-
ketball player and a three-year
starter. Now the Pittsburgh
native is an up-and-coming
assistant coach working on
making his players high-ﬂying
and versatile. Only those play-
ers are not Panthers, they are

Porter is beginning his third
season as an assistant coach
with Pitt’s crosstown rival, the
Duquesne Dukes.

“I am involved with every-
thing here,” Porter said. “I do

recruiting, checking player’s
classes, dealing with the play-
ers on and off the court.”
Porter is heavily involved in
the team’s recruiting process,
although he stresses that it is a

°Porter, page 10

He also added good puck-
handling ability, a swift scor-
ing touch and a physical
dimension to make Pitt one
of the more balanced teams
in the WPCHA.

In net, the Panthers have
finally bid adieu to goal-
tender Mark D’Amico -— a
fixture between the pipes for
Pitt since right around the
turn of the century.

Taking over for D’Amico
as the Panthers’ senior net-
minder will be Dan
Bratkovich, who split time
with D’Amico last season.
He will be joined by a new-
comer, Patrick Kenny. The
duo will likely see equal ice
time in ‘94-’95.

On offense, the Panthers
will miss another top per-
former in Vic Disanti, who
was team captain each of the
past two years.

Disanti was an excellent
playmaker and goal scorer
for the Panthers in ‘93—’94,
finishing among the team
points leaders once again.
His graduation, along with
those of Giordano and
Trovato, opens a huge void
in Pitt’s offensive and defen-
sive game plan.

It is a void that will need to

year in his dual match he lost
to Tom Kirk, and this year he
played him again and beat
him. This shows a good sign
of improvement on Braden’s
part,” head coach George
Dieffenbach said.

Doherty played Duquesne’s
Kirk, one of the top players in
Western Pennsylvania, but
proved himself to be a better
player.

In his second set the match
was tied 4-4 with Doherty
serving. The score was 0-40.

sure and came back to win the

revolving door at quarterback so
far this season.

John Ryan is slated to start this
week, but if things go wrong
look for Sean Fitzgerald or Pete
Gonzalez to get some snaps.

Comparing the way these two
squads played in recent weeks,
it's hard to believe that Pitt is a
10-point favorite.

The only reason that Pitt is
favored is what it has done to
Temple in the past. But that
doesn’t bother the Owls. They
feel that they have something to
offer that schools like Pitt,
Miami and Notre Dame don’t.

“When we recruit, we tell the
kids, ‘If you come to Temple,
you will make history,“‘ Owls
head coach Ron Dickerson said.
“‘If you go elsewhere, you will
be a part of tradition.”

While it seems like Pitt’s tradi-
tion is going down the drain,
Temple is writing a new chapter
in its history book.

having to play a third set.

“I had three break points, so
I put my head down and had
to grind a bit. I guess I was
lucky,’’ Doherty said modestly.

The men went to the invita-
tional as a team but competed
on an individual basis. Some
of the best athletes in Western
Pennsylvania were competing
at the invitational. The top
three seeds competed in Flight
A singles and the lower seeds
competed in Flight B singles.

Brad Wade, playing at the
No.2 seed, was 1-1 in the invi-
tational. He won his first
match against Robert Morris’
Mark Wallace 7-5, 6-4. He
lost his second match against
Duquesne’s Todd Hrabak 6-3,
6-3.

“Brad’s matches were real
tight with close losses. He
improved an awful lot since
last year,” Dieffenbach said.

The No. 3 seed, Matt Mills,
ended up 0-2 for the weekend.

“I think I played better in
practice during the week than

I did at the invitational,” Mills
said. “The competition was a
lot tougher than last year.”

Even though Mills faced
some good players “it was no
reflection on his playing,”
Dieffenbach said.

Senior Anirban Mukherjee
also split for the weekend. He
defeated Robert Morris’ Brian
Miklavic 6-3, 6-1 in his first
match. He lost his second
match to Duquesne’s Geoff
Kasse 6-2, 6-3.

“Anirban lost to a strong
player, but he had a good
showing for the weekend,”
Dieffenbach said.

Craig Cackovic, Cyrus
Zolghadri and Bob Sciranko
were all 0-2 for the invitation-
al.

The doubles team of
Doherty and Wade was the
only team to come out with
any wins. They won their first
two games 8-3 but lost in the
final round to Duquesne’s

Kirk and Eddie Leal 8-3.

“We weren’t returning well
and came out a little ﬂat, and
that hurt us,” Doherty said.

The doubles teams of Mills-
Zolghadri and Mukerjee-
Sciranko lost in their first
matches against Duquesne’s
players.

The competition is over for
the men’s tennis team until
spring. There will only be sin-
gle player competitions for the
rest of this semester.

“We need to work on our
doubles for the spring,”
Dieffenbach said. “There was
no team score at the invita-
tional, so there was no pres-
sure on the team. We just
worked hard on individual
play.”

The next thing on the minds
of the top two seeds, Doherty
and Wade, is the
Intercollegiate Tennis
Association Rolex Main Draw,
at Princeton University in the

first weekend in November.

The ITA Rolex takes the top
singles player and the top dou-
bles team and places them in
the competition.

Doherty will compete in the
singles match and Wade will
compete in the doubles with
Doherty. Dieffenbach hopes to
get Wade a singles match.

Doherty is going into this
competition with an 8-1
record, and the doubles team
of Doherty and Wade will be
going in with a 7-2 record.

The two will be practicing at
Schenley Park for the compe-
tition to_ get used to the hard
courts. The Cost Center has
padded courts, and the men
are used to way the ball
bounces off the turf.

“The hard court has a differ-
ent pressure on our serves,”
Doherty said. “It was good
experience to have tough
matches on hard courts this
past weekend.”

team effort when the Dukes
land a player.

“Everyone here does a little
bit when we are recruiting a
player to come here,” Porter
said.

Duquesne assistant coach
Danny Holzer said Porter’s
best assets for recruiting are
his local ties to Pittsburgh and
his communication skills.

“He is very good at commu-
nicating with people. He sim-
ply has a knack for talking to
people,” Holzer said. “He can
also talk to the kids about the
school and the city. They can
feel his knowledge for the
area.”

One player that Porter played
a key role in the recruitment of
was sophomore Tom Pipkins.
Pipkins, one of the nation’s top

recruits, was the WPIAL all-
time leading scorer at Valley
High school and has bolstered
Duquesne’s recruiting credibil-
1ty.

Along with Porter’s coaching
abilities, he had some great
qualities as a player, according
to former teammate Sean
Miller, whois currently an
assistant coach with the
University of Miami (Ohio)
Redskins.

“He probably would still be
playing pro ball if he he did not
have tendonitis in his knee his
senior year,” Miller said.

“Darelle was just a total team
player, and he was very
unselfish on and off the court.
The bigger the game the better
he played. On the court, pass-
ing was his best asset. Darelle
had a lot of pride in his pass-

Porter said the biggest game
he played in at Pitt was the Big
East Championship game
against the Syracuse
Orangemen in 1988. He also

first with the Panthers.

Porter scored 14 points
against Vanderbilt, Pitt’s sec-
ond—round opponent, and he

The Pitt News, Tuesday, October 25, 1994

kept the Panthers in the game
with two second-half three-
pointers, despite the team
being upset by a last-second
shot.

Miller also said Porter was a
very versatile player, which he
proved in 1988 after taking
over at point guard when
Miller hurt his foot. At 6—feet-
4—inches tall, his natural posi-
tion was at small forward,
although he also spent some
time at shooting guard with the
Panthers.

Before coming to Pitt, Porter
was a three-sport star at
Pittsburgh’s Perry High
School. In his senior year with
the Commodores, he was the
City League MVP in basket-
ball and football and was an
All—City first team for the base-
ball team.

Although Porter did not play
under new Panther head coach
Ralph Willard, he said the team
will move in the right direction
with Willard at the helm.

“I think they are headed in a
positive forward direction,”
Porter said.

Porter did not move to the
Duquesne bench right after
departing from the Fitzgerald
Field House floor. He had
played for the Erie Wave of the
World Basketball League in
1991 and the Albany (Ga.)
Sharp Shooters of the Global
Basketball Association. After
those two stints, he joined John
Carroll’s staff at Duquesne.

Porter said hisfavorite part
of coaching is when he gets on

be filled, and soon, if the
Panthers hope to return to the
top of the WPCHA stand-
ings.

That’s a tough chore for the
young Panthers, who will
need some extra firepower to
pull it off.

Who better to provide fire-
power than a quartet of
Dragons?

The Panthers will be lean-
ing heavily on four players
from Allderdice High School
this season to make their
dreams of a WPCHA cham-
pionship a reality.

Two of them, defense-
man Matt White and forward
Brad Rizzo, were integral in
last season’s playoff run.

White, who played much of
last season as Pitt’s premier
power forward, has been
switched to defense to begin
the l994—’95 campaign due
to that unit’s lack of depth.

The “Freight Train” will
be derailed for 2-4 weeks,
however, as he recovers from
a broken left thumb, suffered
in a preseason loss at West
Virginia.

Rizzo. who joined the club
several games into the ‘93-
’94 season, will be a key to
this new team’s success.

He lends much—needed
quickness and a vital scoring
touch to a team that will need
It.

They will be joined this
season by two new additions
to the Allderdice connection,
forwards Scott Kalson and
Shawn Goldstein.

Kalson is not such an unfa-
miliar face to the Panther
faithful, who will remem-
ber his name among the team
scoring leaders from two
years ago.

A season-ending shoulder
injury during a Panther victo-
ry over Allegheny cut short
Kalson’s promising 1992-’93
rookie season, and he has
returned to finish what he
started.

Goldstein is the one true
newcomer to the Dragon fra-
ternity. He played with White
and Rizzo on an Allderdice
team that captured their
league title.

Goldstein looks to be per-
haps the Panthers’ top rookie
performer this year.

Rizzo, Kalson and
Goldstein will surely be
joined atop the Panther charts
by center iceman Bill‘E1liott,
who comes off a stellar rook-
ie campaign in ‘93—’94.

Elliott finished atop the Pitt
scoring charts, leading most
of the way. He will likely
anchor Pitt’s top scoring line
once again.

It is a team with a lot of
new faces, and the inevit-
able disharmony of action
that ensues.

“Right now, we are a team,
but we’re not a unit,” White
said.

“Each guy has to get used
to the other’s style of play.
You can't really go on
instinct, like you can when
you’ve been playing together
a while.

“We definitely are a team
with a lot of talent waiting to
explode. Everyone’s own
individual style of play will

have to be adjusted.”

One more significant
change for the Panthers is on
the bench, where Harold
Ochs is replaced by Dick
Rizzo.

Rizzo, Panther Brad’s
father, coached Allderdice to
their league champion- ship
with Brad, Matt White and
Shawn Goldstein in the line-
up.

His reputation as a superb
teacher of the game precedes
him, even to the Panthers
who don’t know him person-
ally.

The team hopes this will
aid them in the long, arduous
process of building team
unity.

The Panthers begin their
home schedule on Oct. 29,
when they play the first game
in a home—and- home-
series with Duquesne at
Neville Ice Center on the
South Side. Game time
Saturday is 8 p.m.

. ers,” Porter said.

“He was a very smart player
at Pitt, which really helps out
his teaching the game here,”
said Holzer.

Porter said he is optimistic
about the Dukes’ upcoming
season.

“Hopefully, we can have a
repeat performance of last
year. I hope we can make it

7

back into postseason play,’
Porter said. ’ .

Porter is satisfied with his
job for the moment, but he has
high hopes for the future.

“Hopefully, I’ll be a head
coach within the next 10
years,” he said. “Then I can do
things the way I want to.”

Holzer said he is sure Porter
will reach that goal.

“Some day he will definitely
be a head coach at a major col-
lege,” Holzer said.
