Final plans for construction of
the Hillman Library for Liberal
Arts have been released by the
University.
The ﬁve story library, on which
construction will begin next sum-
mer, will be erected across from

_ the Student Union- on the site of

the present Park Schenley Res-
taurant.

In addition to the increased vol-
ume and reader capacity of the
I-lillman Library, conversation and

study rooms are planned for un-

dergraduate students and students
in postgraduate work.

New listening equipment Will be
installed to aid in language and
music study.

To Cost Ten Million
The design of the Hillman Li-

brary is a contemporary‘ style to 2
in white limestone. i
This design will be a continuation ’

be ﬁnished

of the pattern set by Clap? Hall
and Langley Hall.

The cost of the new structure
will be ten million dollars, one
of the largest sums spent on a li-
brary at one time.

Evcntual expansion plans for
the University are designed to
leave the Cathedral entire1.V 33 3
school of Liberal Arts, after the
professional schools of education,
law. and business are built.

Hillman Library is to be the
ﬁrst of a series of libraries con-
structed. Future plans call for. a
number of social science libraries
to be built on the spot presently
occupied by Forbes Field.

These groups will be comprised
of men and women students who
are studying these languag€S and
who desire to improve their pro-
ﬁciency conversing in these lan-
guages.

“In America it is difficult for
students of foreign langua8’e~‘3 t0

‘Pitt News” Editor Explains

Policies Before

By JIM NELSON

Julie Thomas. editor of The Pitt
News, answered Student Senate
charges against the newspapers‘
policy of selecting and printing
news. with an explanatory state-
ment and discussion at the Senate
meeting Monday.

At last week’s ameeting, several
senators questioned the newspa-
per's right "to print stories which
the Senate felt were not ready for
publication.

In an attempt to clear up the
misunderstanding, Miss Thomas
explained that current news of
Student Government's operations
are of as much interest in the
planning stages as is the ﬁnal out-
come.

“Often, when news is held and
the project under discussion is
dropped, students never ﬁnd out
about it. They have a right to
know, and the newspaper has a
responsibility to let them know,”
she said.

Important to Students

Commenting on the recent arti-
cle on campus drinking, which was
headlined in The Pitt News, Miss
Thomas said, “What you, do as
Student Government, a represen-
tative body, is important to the
students. What you consider hold-
ing news.  in reality withhold-
ing news.”

Senator Bob Slotkin said that
the article on student drinking
on campus was slanted. “You
slanted because of the cartoon
on the editorial page. It was
definitely against campus drink--
log. and you did not comment on
it editorially.”

l\/[iss Thomas smiled as she said
that the cartoon was put in the
paper to draw attention to all the
aspects of students drinking on
ca‘mpu.s.

Book Center,
SC Committee
Review Policy

Each time the University Book
Center sells a ten dollar text-
book, it loses ten cents. In a
meeting with a Student Govern-

ment Book Store Committee re-A

cently, manager Paul Boltacz an-

swered _ student questions about
the store’s operations.
He said that his store gets a

20 per cent discount from the
publisher on every hardcover
textbook, but that handling and
expense cost the book store 21
per cent of the retail price of each
text.

This leaves a one per cent loss
on every hardcover book, but

‘larger profits on paperback books

and school supplies balanced out
the loss and enabled the store to
make a three per cent profit last
year. 

A discount on books, Boltacz
pointed out, would only mean an
increase in some other area since
all University funds go into one
pile.

Then the manager
other student complaints. One
concerned alleged pushing, by
store employees directing students
to the lockers _during the early
fall rush. He said it was definitely
not store policy.

Another complaint stated that

Emergency, Clinical Cases Separated

Health Service Remodels Facilities

By BARRY GROSS
The re-organization of the Student Health Serv-
ice, which was started last January, will include
remodeling facilities on the ground floor of Brack-

enridge Hall.

The new facilities feature separate examination
rooms and . separate waiting rooms for students
withappointments and for those without.

While the carpenters work on

floor, the Health‘Service will telescope their op-

erations into the other half. Work

pleted by the beginning of January.

Dr. Douglass S. Thompson. director of the
Service, joined it last January. He is an assistant
professor in the School of Medicine. His appoint-
ment stemmed from the administratioinhs dissatis-
faction with the Student Union Service which was
inadequate mostly "because of an increase in the

~ number of resident students...
Formerly there were separate
for men and women. These were

 

 

one half of the

limited in the

_f

scope of what they could do and in the amount of
service they gave. Today, the combined service is
open 24 hours a day. Clinical facilities operate sev-
en and a half hours a day, Monday through Friday.

“I feel that wehave provided an opportunity
for everyone to-come here for non-emergencies
during that time. We cannot adequately cover non-
emergencies 24 hours a day,” Dr, Thompson ex-
plained, “Of course, illness can come at any time
and disrupt everyone’s routine.”

In addition to Thompson. Drs. Helsel and
Carlson are also on duty. Five physicians ro-
tate evening‘ and weekend duty. The service is
only closed occasionally for 15 or 20 minutes
while the doctor on duty goes to lunch or dinner.
but a physician can always be reached.

For the first time the Service is closely relat-
ed to the University Medical Center and is admin-
istrated by it. Thompson said that a new Health
Service building may be planned within the next.

Croghan - Schenley Rooms Depict

Grecian Revival St

The Croghan-Schenley
Rooms of the Cathedral are
considered to be among the
finest representatives of the
Greek Revival style in west-
ern Pennsylvania.

The two rooms, a ballroom and
an oval. reception room, were
originally part of Picnic House,
the family residence of William
Crognan Jr.

Built around 1835 the house‘

stood in Stanton Heights in Pitts-
burgh for well over a Century.

To the original stone house in i
which the rooms were, Croghan ,
later added a large brick structure _
which was intended as a home for ;
his daughter, Mary Elizabeth ,

Croghan. and her British husband,
Capt. Edward E. I-l. Schenley.
Known as Schenley House

Although the Schenleys visited

Pittsburgh infrequently and lived "

at the house for only a short

length of time, the house came to .

be known as the Schenley House.

Mary Crogha-n Schenley in-
herited the house in 1850 upon
the death of her father and
passed it on to her English heirs,
the Schenleys, when she her-
self died some years later.

After 1850 the house was~0ccu-
pied only by the caretakers, and
ﬁnally, in l9-15 the house was sold
to William S. Miller, a wrecker,
for demolition.

University Interested

Upon learning that the Metro-
politan Museum was considering;
purchasing‘ the building for 1‘es—i
toration of the two rooms, the3
University contacted Miller and:
he gave the University permission:
to remove such structuraldetailsl
of the original rooms as remained.

He did this in the name of his
father. Hirschel Miller, to whose
memory the rooms are dedi-
cated.

George Hubbard Clam), presi-
dent oi‘ the University’s Board of
Trustees at the time. provided the
funds to make possible the dis-
mantling, moving, and" restora-
tion.

Unfortunately, the beautiful
Georgian furniture and paintings?
which once were in the room were 
sold at auction and the University‘,

S $ 1
has not been able to recover these
pieces. .

The rooms were restored and
preserved in the University be-
cause ol their historical and archi-
tectural. signiﬁcance in the com-
munity.

The rooms have been converted
into offices and are now being
used by Vice—Chancell0r Rankin.

In the Meantime

In the recent Health Service controversy, the old
problem of University lag has reared its head once more.
The University just cannot expand fast. enough to meet the
demands of increasing student populations.

As Dr. Thompson admitted, the present health service
leaves much to be desired. Hopefully, he continued, ade-
quate facilities will be available in six years.

This same theme has been repeated in the dorm situa-
tion, the erection of a Student Union and the acquisition of
more quality faculty members. The policy is one of wait
and see. But what about now? D

Granted, being considered an integral part of a pioneer-
ing University has its excitement. Yet, while participating
in the experimental stage, is it wholly selﬁsh to consider
what we arelosing in the meantime?

The health situation is just one aspect of the total
problem. While the overall picture is clear in its purposes,
the constant internal change and revision needed to make
up for current inadequacies, physical as well as academic,
just cannot produce a settled, stable University population.

Were the problem simply one of physical planning,
perhaps it could be more easily endured, but when problems
of actual education are involved, the situation becomes
much more meaningful, as Dr. Heath pointed out last week.

The problem, to a large extent, is one of attitude, yet
how much can anyone be asked to sacrifice for what will
come later? College education means just as much now as
it did before and as it will in the future.

One of the purposes of college is to provide a challenge
and guide for what is to come.

When an individual’s own future is at stake it is dif-
ﬁcult to feel noble in the present sacriﬁce, for so much can
happen in the meantime.

Bless This Board!  

By Susanna Diorwnie

Tomorrow, as you all doubtlessly already know,
there will transpire on campus an event kl’10WY1 35
Activities Fair, in which various campus organiza-
tions will compete for your invaluable attentions.
Few people know, however, that this affair derives
from a celebration practiced. in
Ancient Rome, where the stu-“
dents were given to annua
feasts in honor of one of their
favorite deities, namely, Miss
Activities, sister of Bacchus and
arch rival of Dame Academe
This tradition was carried acros
Europe and the Middle Ages by
wandering students and folk
singers, to the schools and col-'
leges of today, where Miss Ac 1
tivities and her band of attend-
ants’ (Debate, Publications, Drama, etc., etc.) are
still busy diverting students and harassing scholars.
One of these young attendants, a 1ate—bloomer who
joined the troupe somewhere in the midst of the
Middle Ages, Student Union, by name, and’ to come
to the point of all this facetiae, has an enthusiastic
but altogether too limited following here at our
own dear University. Practically everyone, but es-
pecially the dormitory student, uses the Student
Union Building for one thing oranother, even if
only to eat and sleep in. But no one seems to know
just what the Student Union, as an organization, is
and what it does, much less how one can take part
in the many activities involved. Most students take
Student Union services and programs more—or-less
for granted, not realizing that the work required to
keep these things doing is done for little else than
the sheer satisfaction of doing it, which, because
of the frustrations and messes that are continually
cropping up, is sometimes non—existent.
Show Runner

The Student Union Board pretty much runs the

 

 

 

insipid And Incme . . .

 

show. It consists of the chairmen of the commit.

tees, a representative from the Dean of WyQn1en’s C
Office, and two paid staff members. The “Students
of the Union Board, probably come as close to co..j

operating with the Administration as do any other
students on campus, and in spite of this they man.
age to accomplish a great deal that beneﬁts every-

one who uses the Union. The programs are ﬁn,-,m_ 
cially supported by the University (i.e. the stu..\

dents pay); so within the conﬁnes of their budget,
the Board members are responsible only to the Stu-V.
dents they try to represent.
Do the Work

The Student Union Committees, co-ordinated by
the Board, do lmost of the work connected with
organizing and carrying-out everything from Ori-
entation Week Open House (in the Union’) to exam
week Study Breaks, with Midday Series, Univer-
sity P.M., Film Series, dances, jazz concerts, and
special events (such as Parent's Week—End Open
House) in between. In addition, the committees are
responsible for such regular Union facilities as the

Music Room, the recreation room, Bridge nights, C

etc. The Board itself handles contracts for Union

ofﬁce space leased to student organizations, and‘

decides on the purchasing of new equipment for
the Union. For instance, last summer, the Union
-bought a ditto machine and a mimeograph, which
are available to University organizations at cost.
Each of these activities undertaken, by the
Union involves all sorts of arrangements, which,
again, are for the most part done by the students
on the committees. There are always posters to be

, made, publicity to be put in the Pitt News.,speakera

to be .met at the airport, people to be called for
I'€‘S€T‘Vati0DS, and disasters (somebody’s parents are
stuck in the elevator!) to be avoided and/or coped
with; these things take stamina and courage, to say
the least, but, urifortunately, few students seem
either willing or able to demonstrate their prowess
in these matters.

The Civics Coarse

By Barry Gross

With questions like “Red or Dead” confronting
the world, a solid background in the study of
democracy is necessary for young Americans. The
high schools of our nation attempt to meet this
need -with the twelfth grade‘ civics course. Its
function is to make the students
aware of the signiﬁcance of cur-
rent events on the decisions he ,
will have to make when he goes
“out into the world.” But, be-
insipidness. the
civics course textbook used in
many of the city's top high
schools has proven detrimental.

The book seems to operate on .
two assumptins. First, that ma-
terial should be selected for pre-
sentation to the reader showing
international conflict as a struggle between the
good guys —- that‘s us —- and the bad guys -— the
Communists. Second, that. along with receiving
world politics over-simpliﬁed, the reader should
receive information on “Facing Life’s Problems” —-—
marriage and elementary biology, 8th grade eco-
nomics, and the proper use of leisure time.

Heavy Lace ‘

All of ‘the tex”t is so heavily laced with super-
patriotism that the book is a challenge for high
school students —— a challenge in endurance.

Back in 12th grade I asked a high school civics
teacher if she thought that the book was geared
too low for seniors. “Well, clear,” she, answered,
“you must remember that most of your classmates
ﬁnd this book quite adequate for their levels of
intelligence.”

One of my classmates who was not an avid
scholar summed up his reactions to the book. “It’s
stupid,” he complained. “Look at this sentence
under the chapter, ‘Using Our Leisure Time.’ It
says, "Money plays a part in our choices of recre-
ation because many of the things we want to do
often cost too much.‘ I mean, I don’t haveto read
no book to tell me that.”

A great many parts bf the book make revela-
tions that are not revelations, but insults to the
high school intelligence. Each chapter ends with
a list of “New Terms and Concepts" which are de-
fined or introduced in the chapter. The chapter on
“Developing a Philosophy of Life,” for example, in-
cludes puzzlers in its terms list as “rabbi, Catholic,
Communism, slave science and logic.” A later sec-
tion, "Democracy Challenges Totalitarianism,” in-

 

 

troduces two specialized concepts — “war"” and
“patriotism.” '

I This section also makes available the key to
international affairs —-— something for which politi-
cal scientists have been searching for many years,
A ‘CW0 Page map sharply divides the world into
three definite camps: the democratic camp, the
Communist camp, and the neutral states. The edi-
l01'5 h3V€ gene1'0usly,p1aced all of Central and
South America into the Democratic camp.
Awareness Pervades ‘

The importance of civic awareness pervades

The C3l3li0T1 Writers may be having fun at the
Rublisherls expense. “Democracy rests on the prin-
cipal that people are sufficiently intelligent, if given
the facts, to form their own opinions.” These are
ﬁne, indisputable sentiments. But should they be

Group Rescheduled

After Cancellation

Cadet Joseph Scuro of Pershing
Rifles announced that the group
will participate during halftime
of the Pitt-Navy game as pre-
viously scheduled.

The Army ROTC drill unit had
feared that their performance
would be cancelled after drilling

lunch hour on the Cathedral lawn.
The halftime planning commit-
‘tee had failed to ask Navy if they

=were bringing any entertainment
land assumed that they would not.
}When the Navy Commander sent
la letter to the committee con-
jﬁrming that their Drum and
lBugle Corps would entertain, the
gPershing Rifles were cancelled.
I “It was a big thing for us to
ishow the University what we
could do,” Scuro said, “and we
were naturally disappointed.”

They were later informed that
the Pitt Band had decided to cut
their routine in order to give the
group time to perform. Plans now
call for the Pershing Rifles to
;drill for seven to eight minutes
?-after the band plays.

The Rifle group will also en-
tertain November 11, during half-
time at; the Pitt-Notre Dame

It is now necessary for a stu-

It has been necessary to make
it more difficult to get a duplicate
invoice, because students have
been abusing the past policy,
Monnett said. In the past stu-

“However, on the Thursday

invoices were issued by the
Treasurer's office, making it ap-

would have to be instituted," he

“It Goes On..."

 

“GARBAGE” AND “THE GIPPER”
The pseudo-psychologists and fairy-tale lovers of Hans
Christian Anderson were gullible enough to believe that
the “garbage” quote attributed to Panther End John Kuprok
was the stimulant that pushed the hypoed Mountaineers of

.West Virginia to a victory, but we feel that it’s pure non-

sense. We’re not trying ‘to get ourselves off the hook, just
trying to keep our’ heads out of the effigy noose.

, Some people have asked us why we used the quote in
our pages. Our answer: it was newsworthy. Ralph Waldo
Emerson, an old poetic sportswriter who covered pigeon
races, once said, “There is a beneﬁt in a brag, that the speak-

er is unconsciously expressing his own ideal. Humor him by

all means; draw it all out, and hold him to it.” That’s what
we did!

But the way the dramatic incident mushroomed into
major proportions seems nearly fictional. In fact it seems like
it belongs in‘ the off-Broadway theatre production, “Leave It
To Jane,” where between halves of the Big Thanksgiving
Day game between Atwater and Bingham College, the play-
ers are melodiouslyiencouraged to struggle on to victory by
Silent Murphy, a piano mover who was persuaded to play
for Atwater. I ‘ I

T Rockne £1 O'Brien

When I was a kid, my Dad took me to see Pat O’Brien
(no relation) in the Knute Rockne picture, and I don’t mind
telling you, Dad and I both bawled when Mr. Rockne asked
the team to go out and win one for the Gipper. _

There’s no time, however, for the Gipper in modern foot-
ball. Why what do you think the assistant football coaches
are doing all during the first half’? Two of them have been
planted in the press box, talking to the ben'ch on the phone
and dictating to a graduate student at the typewriter, setting
down what every player did, what every play of the opposi-
tion did.

They race down to the dressing room at half time,
loaded with statistics, and slap them on a blackboard so
the coach can get up there and tell the boys precisely
what’s working for their team, what’s not working for
their team, what alterations they’ll make in their defense
for the second half, what plays they’ll run, what they’ll
discard.

Holy mackeral, if a coach, today, started to talking a lot
of mush like Pat O’Bri.en in the movies, he would never get
his work done. People ‘had better wise up. Big-time football
is a scientiﬁc operation. ’

Forest Evashevski, formerly the coach of the ultra-

successful Iowa Hawkeyes and now the athletic director;
there, rejects the “pep-talk” theory. “The coach who tries to ‘

get his kids sky—high emotionally,” the former dual major in
sociology and psychology at Michigan says, “is the coach
who’s always gonna have that big letdown during the sea-
son. You can tell one kid something and you’ll get him to
jump right out of his shoes with enthusiasm.
"You're Balmy"

' “And you tell another kid the same thing and he’ll look
at you and say, ‘Hell, you’re a little balmy.’ ” My own concen-

' tration is on football, not emotion.

But if people insist on the thesis that the “garbage
quote was the“ omen of victory for the Mountaineers, I
will not breach their superstitions. Myron Cope, the
sports writer, who emcees the “Pitt Football” game ﬁlms
on Sunday afternoon on television, said “that it back-
ﬁred like Charley’s Dressen’s ‘the Giants is dead’ quote.”

. But, happily enough, he had the good sense to say “that
it gives -the game some ﬂavor, but it had nothing really to do
with the outcome of the contest.”

We’ll leave it at that.

 

Win-ﬂungry Panthers

Bad Injuries

Cripple Cats

John Michelosen’s gridder

and the veterans of last{
year’s sickening last—minute
l loss liken the community

more aptly to a haven for devils
and cheats, at least as far as the
refereeing fraternity is concerned.

Meanwhile they themselves are
trying to get out of the hellish in-
ferno that they find themselves in
with a 1-3 chart. They are trying

the winning formula to test the
Bruins with.

The Panther football team that
fell to West Virginia last Satur-
day looked ﬂatter than a ﬁve cent
draft beer. They were ﬂattened
by the frustrating experience of
losing two straight tough battles,
and seven of the first 22 players
were sitting nervously on the far
wing "of the bench, dressed in
civilian clothes.

Better Mental-Wise

Physically speaking, the Pan-
thers don’t look much better than

last week. In fact, their forces
suffered a few more minor losses
,jin the recent scuffle. But accord-
ing to Roger lVlcGil1, the little
*,medicine man of the troops, they
;are far better; mental-wise.

' “They showed real ﬁne spirit
on the ﬁeld today,” McGill re-
-marked of Monday afternoon’s
practice session. “Mentally, they

Thin.-Clads Take
Two Week Layoff;
,Then llleet WVU

Hoping to avenge last season's
27-28 defeat by West Virginia,
Pitt’s varsity harriers will have
almost two weeks to prepare to

tangle with the Mountaineers on
October 28.

Carl Reels, coach of the Panther
,cross—country squad, again be-
lieves that a victory will depend
upon the performances of sopho-
mores Larry Robinson and Bill
Mocnik.

“I’m sure t.hey’re capable of
running much better than they’ve
done so far,” explained the Pitt
coach. “Maybe Steve Waslo does
have more desire, but both Mocnik
and Robinson also have the poten-
tial and the ability to finish near
the top." I

The Panther thin-clads, still
winless in dual meets this season,
certainly hope that the sopho-

Frosh Seek 2nd
Triumph Friday

The freshman football team will
try to avenge the beating receiv-
ed by the Varsity last Saturday
when they take on the West Vir-

practice ﬁeld.

The little Mounties have al-
ready won two games this year.
Their " victims were Fairmount
Junior Varsity and the Freshmen
from Virginia Tech.

The Cubs crushed their rivals
48-0 last year. In the all time
series, which dates back to 1920
the Pittsburghers lead l8-10-2. A

When the Panthers travel to Los Angeles
on Saturday to meet the Bruins of U.C.L.A.
they will only be facing an 11 man team in-
stead of the l3 man squad they faced last
year. . ‘
The 13 players come from the fact that
two officials were highly instrumental in
giving U.C.L.A. the winning. touchdown in
the closing seconds of play. The Panthers
thought so much of the otﬁcials efforts in
behalf of the opposition that they named
them to their al1—opponent team. ‘

This year Athletic Director Frank Carver
wisely saw to it‘ that half of the officiating
crew would be from the East. This system
has worked admirably in the past, so. the
Cats should have to contend with only 11
players on Saturday.

The Uclans, who were highly regarded
in the pre-season ratings, have not lived
up to expectations. After winning their
opener against the Air Force they lost on
successive Saturdays to Big Ten power-
houses Michigan and Ohio State. Last
weekend they got back in the winner’s
circle by defeating Vanderbilt, 28-21.

Coach Bill Barnes is one of a dwindling
numberpof major college coaches to still use
the single-wing. Barnes will not have All-
American Bill Kilmer to spark the attack.

Soccer Team

St. Lozris Unit

Boolers Gun For
Third Win Early

Soccer Coach Leo Bemis sends
a young team onto the field this
Saturday against St. Louis. Only
twoseniors will be in the start—
ing lineup for the game, which
will be played at Pitt Stadium.
The opening kickoff. is set for 1:30
pm.

   

The two seniors are fullback
Steve Daniels, team captain, and
halfback Ray ‘Tarasi. Fullback
Chuck Dunbar and wing Pete
Smith, although only second term
juniors, are in their last seasons
of eligibility.

One of the five sophomores to
start may hold the key to victory
over the defending national
champs. Al Sichel, hampered thus
far by a minor leg‘ injury and an
aversion to running, has begun
to work into Bemis’ scheme of
things, and is scheduled to start
at center forward. Sichel, a na-

the moves of a good soccer play—
er, and his attitude seems to be
improving.

This also allows Bemis to shift
Bob Cuthbert back to right Vvlng.

After all this lineup juggling.
Bemis is still uncertain. about the
outcome of Saturday's game. “St.
Louis won’t be any better than
Michigan State was, but they’re-
still the champs and we’ll have
our hands full.”

The coach thinks that the Bil-
likens will hustle more, and with
better speed, than did Michigan
State, but that probably the St.
Louis defense won’t be as tough.

“‘I’m pretty sure we can score
on them,” Bemis adds.

The visitors will be minus two
topnotch performers, .Tom Mc-
Donnell and Tom 1-Iennessey,
when they take the field Saturday
against the Cats. Both have bro-

In the graduated star’s tailback slot will be

Bob Smith, who was Kilmer’s understudy
last season.

Playing behind Smith is Smith, Rob by
name and no relation. Rob Smith is more
of the Kilmer type. He passes, runs and
kicks with equal adeptness. Ezell Singleton
will also see action at tailback.

A 9.8 sprinter, Kermit Alexander, will
probably be holding down the wingback po-
sition. He lettered last year at fullback and
is an outstanding pass receiver. It was this
ability that prompted his move to wingback.
His blazing speed will also be a valuable as-
set on the reverse play, which is one of the
trademarks of the single—wing attack.

Three lettermen give U.C.L.A. strength at
fullback. A senior with the unlikely name of
Almose Thompson heads the trio. He was
the second leading scorer on last year’s
squad. Backing up Almose will be Mitch
Dimkick, a name which rivals Almose, in
novelty, and Joe Zeno.

Bob Stevens and Jim Bergman will share
the load at blocking back.

The line is bulwarked by All-American
candidate Ron Hull, who handles the ball
snapping chores. End Don Vena and Tackle
Marshall Shirk are strong candidates for
an All-Sectional team.

Basketball Season Noti Far;
T immons to Rely on Sophs

By ED HOWARD

Four lettermen returned to Bob
”l‘immons’ basketball team when
drills began last Monday, but only
three were on hand.

Ben Jinks, Tom Maloney, and
Bob Sankey are all at the Field
House every day, but a fourth
numeral winner, John Maczuzak,
is still toiling for John Michelo-
scn at tackle.

Jinks, a 6-3" forward from
Long island, is considered the
best shot on the team. He ave-
raged 13 points a game t.o lead
the Panthers last year. Ben is a
junior.

    
   

Sophs Help
M-aloncy and Sankey, seniors,
-‘ I ‘* " i~ are both outside
men. Tom, a

good ball hand-
ler, and Jinks,

mention recog-
nition last year.
“But we’ll
depend a lot
on sopho-
‘ mores,” Tim-
BEN JINKS mons admit-
ted. There will be as many as
three in the starting lineup.”
The four that will do a lot of
playing will be Brian General-
ovich (6’-3”), Cal Sheffield
(6’-1”), Dave Sauer (65-4”),
and Paul Krieger (6’—6”).

“With these kids,” says Tim-
mons, ‘‘well have a lot better
team speed and better all-around
shooting. We’ll be able to play
more aggressive defensive ball
because of our improved depth.
And I seem to sense an improved
spirit around here, too.”

Acheck can be worth any amount——mii|ions of dollars to a few cents. Whatever
the amount, the check itself probably cost the writer a dime. Now a dime may
not seem like very much money (especially if you can sign a million—dollar check).
But figure how many checks you write every year and multiply that by ten cents.
Adds up, doesn’t it? The answer: Stop in at The Union National Bank and open
a free personal checking account. There‘s no service charge. No mainte-
nance charge. No charge for new checks.'No charge for deposits. All you do is
keep a $200 balance and your account is free. Sound-good? Stop in soon.

beams. This means that there will
be more time to develop skills
before the season opener.

That game, incidentally, is at

The Panther mentor admits that
his squad will be green at First,
and will probably make many
characteristic errors. “But by the
middle of the season, we should
be a really formidable unit. We
should be able to improve on last
years 12-11 record.”

Trustee Board
Approves New

Administrator

The University’s Board of
Trustees recently approved the
appointment of Edison Mont-
gomery to the post of assistant
chancellor for planning.

Montgomery joined the Univer-
sity as director of personnel, in
October, 1956. He was then pro-
moted to the position of director
of institutional planning, the posi-
tion he held before his present
appointment.

Before coming to the Univer-
sity, Montgomery was a principal
associate of Cresap, McCormick
and Paget of New York City be-
tween 1953 and 1956. He assist-
ed in surveys of several univer-
sities. He also was connected with
faculty personnel practice at Case
Institute of Technology.

After receiving his A.B. degree
from the University of California
at Berkeley, in 1938, he was
awarded a Graduate Fellowship to
Yale, but resigned after one
month to accept employment.

Montgomery is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Sigma
Alpha, political science honorary
fraternity.

Beautiful young people are ac-
cidents of nature. But beautiful
old people are works of art.

commmzns CAN NOW TRADE DATACOAST TO COAST OVER TELEPHONE LINES.

IBM has developed systems of computer-to-com

puter communication, which foretell the greatest ’

advances in data processing since the introduction
of the stored--program computer. These Tele-Proc-
essing* systems greatly extend the useful range of
data processing-—puttingtheir power at the disposal
of businessmen and scientists located miles away.

Now it is possible to transmit data between two
computer installations at speeds up to 62,500 char-
acters per second via broad-band communications
channels. Any number of computing systems can be
linked in this way in order to exchange information
or feed it to a data processing center. As a result,
although they may be separated by a continent,

You naturally havea
better chance to grow

computers can bring their capacities to bear on a
single massive problem or operation.

There can be an exciting future for the graduate
at IBM. The choice of jobs is wide. Advancement
potential is excellent. All qualified applicants will
receive consideration for employment without re-
gard to race, creed, color or national origin. What--i
ever your talents and skills, there may be just the‘
job you've always looked forward to after college.’
Why not find out by talking with the IBM repre-
sentative when he next visits your campus? Or write,‘

ager of Technical Employment, IBM Corporation,’

will be held at noon on Friday,
in the Cbmmons Room. Those in-
terested in joining a discussion
group in French, Spanish or Ger-
man are invited to sign up.

The idea of a discussion table
was first conceived last year
when several French students
formed a “Table Francoise” and
met for lunch weekly. The stu-
dents often invited various pro-
fessors to eat with the group
and the “Table” was conducted
on an informal basis.

Plans for the groups to be form-
ed include the attendance of fac-
ulty members from different de-

partments once every two weeks
anda tea for scholars.

"When our rebuilding is com-
,plete, we will have available
"here superior care in surgery,
internal medicine, dermatology,
orthopedics, psychiatry, gyneco-
logy, and hopefully,'if arrange,-
ments work out, dentistry,”
Thompson predicted.

“There are now facilities for
lab tests and X—rays,” be con-
tinued. “All these services will
be given with the awareness that
we are dealing with college stu-
dents, a certain age group, which
has implications regarding the
practice of medicine.”

Eventually, the: Student Health

Service plans to enterthe area

of health education. “I hope that

through visits to the Service and
talks from members of our staff,
students may be helped in health

education,” the director said.
Subjects would include the
effects of smoking, types of im—.
munization, a discussion of wh-all
constitutes good *medical care,'
what basic medicines are good
for what illnesses, when vitamins
are necessary and when they are
harmful. , -

Thompson feels that students
should learn that this health pro-
gram is not a right, but a service
of the University. They should
carefully read the S insurance
brochure to understand what
services their policy entitles them
i to. '

“The Student Health Service
wants to receive constructive cri-
ticism from students and faculty,”
Dr. Thompson emphasized. “We
will never be perfect and there
will always be valid criticisms

against us. Medicine is not magic."

As Top Cadets

The Army ROTC Departmcm,
together with the Chancellor,
named the following senior
cadets as Distinguished Military
Students for the school year 1961-
62.

Jerome F. Anderson, James R.
Marshall, Kurt R. Nestel, Richard
E. Pauley, Joseph A. Sciulli, Stev-
en N. Spatz, and John A. Witt.

A Distinguished Military Stu-
dent is a senior cadet who has

been selected by the ROTC De-

partment and the Chancellor for
outstanding performance in aca-
demic achievement.

“T h e physician-patient relation-

ship depends greatly upon the
student who must listen, ask
questions, accept or reject his

doctor's advice and work with
him.

John Ray, an English
naturalist and
collector of proverbs,
first called attention
to the difficulty of
“finding a needle in
a haystack."

But it's not a problem
to find it in our men’s
clothes, which are
lavishly tailored with
hand-needlework
wherever it adds to

Wo might as: Well tell you straight oil’: Corvair’a tho car for the driving enthusiast. Thinll
that lets you out‘? Maybe. Maybe not.

Until you“vo driven one, you really can't say for sure, because Corvair's kind oi’ driving Ii!
like no otlior in tho land. The amazing air-cooled rear engine sees to that. You swing around
curves ﬂat as you please, in complete control. You whip through the sticky spots other can:
should keep out of in than first ‘place, (Especially this year, now that you can got: Posii:.ract.'ioiz1
as an extra‘-cost option.) You stop smoothly, levelly with Corva'ir’.s beautifully balanced,
bigger bralces.

And Corvair'is found other new ways to please you this year. A forced-air heater and
Vdeefrostor mo otandard equipment on all coupes, sedans and both Monza and 700 Station
Wagons. So are dual sunshades and front—door armrests and some other goodieo. You'll noio
some new styling, inside and out. N ice. And safetgwbelt installatio‘n is easier, too, and oheaépor...
Another eictra-cost option well worth considering is the hieavyy-duty front and rear suspension;
it turns 23. Coi*vair into a real tiger.

So you can see we haven’t really done much to Corvalr lcliis yoar. Why on earth should wo?
If ‘this ooh, just.‘ as she 18, can’t make a driving o‘nl:liusi:aol: out of you, bother time a cab.
