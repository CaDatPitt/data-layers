 University Financed

Fraternity Housing
To Be Investigated

Possibilities for University ﬁnanced fraternity and sor-
ority houses will be‘ investigated by a Board of Trustees
committee to be appointed by Chairman of the Board
Gwilym Price, Acting Chancellor David Kurtzman an-

nounced Tuesday.

“We ought to have University financed fraternity hous-

‘ ‘' ing,” said Dr. Kurtzman,” providing that the organizations

put up a sufficient amount to make the financing feasible.”

Dr. Kurtzman pointed ou

DR. DAVID KURTZMAN
Comments on Greek Housing

t that if the University sup-

plemented fraternity funds for
housing, the group “cannot prac-
tice discrimination.” In the event
that vacancies existed in the hous-
es, fraternities might be asked to
house non-members, he said.

Dr. Kurtzman speculated that
the fraternity houses would be
“somewhere on the hill,” near the

new dormitories.

Fraternity housing as well as
the new dorms, a new Student
Union and state-financed buildings
will be structured in a new master
plan giving an overview of the
University’s growth for the next
20 to 30 years, Dr. Kurtzman _an-
nounced.

Future student invoices
may have an item titled
“Student Union Fee” added
to them_ This will be the case
if -a bill passed Wednesday
by Student Government
(SG) can gain administra-
tive approval. The bill pro-

vides for student ﬁnancing of a

new Student’ Union and-— urges,

the inclusion of plans for a
Union in the University's Master
Plan for the Oakland Campus.

No deﬁnite -ﬁgures were set in
the bill, introduced by Senator
Art Cohen. But, the bill stated
that the amount of the fee would
be determined by the proposed
cost of construction of a union.
After the new Union is com-
pletely ﬁnanced, the Student
Union Fee would be reduced, pro-
viding for maintenance and ex-
pansion of the building. The SG
legislation also says that the ﬁrst
students to be billed would be
those who would still be in school
when the union is completed.

President Ralph Manning noted
that he would present the ap-
proved bill to Acting Chancellor

David Kurtzman. The Board of
Trustees must approve any over-
all changes on invoices and thus
they must okay the proposed fee
before students can be charged.

Another big money matter was
decided at the meet. SG voted to
approve an allocation of $9,000
for Winter Weekend. This is the
same amount allocated for Home-
coming and is an increase of $4,-
000 over the Winter "Weekend al-
location of last year. The overall
budget for the event is appro-
ximately $13,700.

Several SG senators had ques-

tioned the right of SG to act on‘

the fee bill. Sen. Anne Baker
was one of these. She felt that a
general fund raising project
would be more in order. Other
senators didn't feel SG should
commit itself to the fee. Senators
Ron Bellohusen and Ron Cowell
said that "‘we have nothing def-
inite to work on” and “there are
too many questions up in the
air.” 7 * 4 ,
However, Sen. Cohen admitted,
and Manning agreed, that the
bill is mainly stimulus to getting
a new union building put in the
Master Plan. This plan will be
an outline of construction and

Psychology, Emotion Significant

Speaker Names Black Power Causes  

by PAUL STOLLER

“Black Power was always part’
of the civil rights program. The
whole Black Power slogan came
from the southern segment of the
Civil Rights movement,”
tained Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint
Tuesday. Dr. Poussaint, a psy-
chiatrist and recent southern
ﬁeld director for the Medical
Committee for Human Rights of
Jackson, Miss.,«spoke at an in-

formal discussion jointly spon-,

sored by the Pittsburgh chap-
ters of Medical Committee for
Human Rights, the Anierican Civ-
ii Liberties Union, and Pittsburgh
Friends of the Council of Fed-

A» erated Organizations (COFO).

Dr. Poussaint centered his dis-
cussion on the psychological and

main-\.

 

He began by postulating that the
average civil rights worker has
experienced many physical and
psycological abuses. Because of
these abuses, he continued, most
civil rights workers in the South
have a constant fear for their
lives. Poussaint concluded that
“these abuses and fears cause a
chronic state of anxiety and
rage.”

Dr. Poussaint deﬁed those who
believe in the merits of the
movement towards integration.
He stressed that “integration is
only token in the South. The
laws outlawing segregation have
not worked in the South. Conse-
quently, the civil rights workers
don’t really care about integra-
tion. Instead, there is more talk

‘black _ consciousness.” Pous-J

   

saint stated that the workers
needed a sense of identity. “They
Want to feel self-esteemed in be-
ing black.” He concluded, “This
black consciousness was part of
the civil rights movement "before
the events of the Meredith
march.”

Shifting to his experiences on
the Meredith march, Dr. Pous-
saint gave a brief history on the.
evolution of the slogan of Black
Power. Poussaint remarked that
the newsmen attached to the
march were quite bored with the
proceedings. But when the Stu-
dent Non- violent Coordinating
Committee (SNOC) started to

shout, “We want Black Power,” _

the phrase caught on. However,

. according to Dr. Poussaint, “The
news reaction.’-to the slogan was

   
 

a distortedone. The term fright-
ened people.”

Poussaint extoled, “Black has
a sinister connotation. It brings
across a fear of belligerence.
Thus, most white people connect
Black Power to violence.” The
result of the connection of Black
Power to violence, Poussaint con-_
cluded, “has caused backlash.”

Dr. Poussaint was pessimistic
about the future of the Negro
revolution. If the white power
struction continues to equate
Black Power to the Black Plague,
there will be further repression
of the Negro, which will lead to
rage and frustration, resulting in,
more riots. This will deﬁnitelx
hurt the Negro’s progress. “I am
pessimistic about the civil rights
situation today,’,’. he declared. ‘

 Payne Chapel Priest Sells
Peanuts on Cathedral Lawn

. by AL SIEG

noon, you may see a peanut vendor. For 15c, you can get
some of the most articulate and flowery conversation avail-
able (and also a bag of peanuts).

REVEREND J. H. MADDEN

Peanut Vendor

Reverend J. H. Madden is no ~

ordinary peanut man, but an or-
dained minister, the assistant”
pastor of the Payne Chapel in
Duquesne. He has been selling
peanuts for 26 years, and thor-3
oughly enjoys talking with each
of his customers. In fact, when
he sees a familiar face, he often
asks, “And how is my distinguish-
ed friend today?” ,
Madden feels that he “was
born a minister. Preachers are‘

'. :5.
"aﬁ 2; ~,_-..

born, not made. I was born to
sow the seeds of kindness and
fertilize the _minds of individ
uals.”

He sells peanuts in front of
Forbes Field, Pitt Stadium, the
Field House, the Civic Arena, and
the Cathedral of Learning. He
lives in East Liberty and travels
to these spots by trolley. ‘ .

He was asked to speak before
the US Congress in 1962, but
missed the chance because he
was late in returning from Cali-
fornia. He hopes to have another
opportunity so that he may dis-

cuss the tense condition of the

world. Reverend Madden believes
that the solution to the world's
conﬂicts will be for people to
“Civilize, Christianize, and Evan-
gelize.”

His eternal optimism is shown
by the way he picks up two bags
of peanuts when a customer ap-
proaches.

.Madden occupies his time by
handling religious work in
schools, and by doing all he can
to better the relationships be-
tween races and nationality
groups. “What I’m concerned
about is: Peace, Progress, and
Prosperity,”’ he said, “not only
for the commonwealth, but for
the world.”

University Health Service

 

 

Students Need ‘Cure-All’ Pill do

by BERNI MCLEOD

The pill to, cure every ill has
yet to be invented. Even one to
treat the headaches, fatigue or
don't-feel-well troubles of college
students is still a long way off.
According to Dr. Douglass Thomp-
son, director of the University
Health Service, such pills might
be handy for treating numbers of
students coming to the Health
Service each week.

In Thompson’s estimation, col-
lege medical care centers through.
out the country have difficulty
caring for and satisfying stu-
dents. Fatigue and day-to-day dis-
comforts, typical illnesses of
young adults, may stem from
various causes and complicate
diagnosis.

“Such illnesses,” said Thompson,
“affect us all, but people with
low tolerance for daily problems
magnify aches and pains. Unfor-
tunately, there is no pill for the
woes of life. To help some stu-

dents, we must ﬁnd out what
their real needs are.-

“Considering the University as
a whole,” he added, “we are a
well community. Few people
have diseases that require re-
peated treatment. Most of the
visits involve orthopedics, short-
lived day-to-day discomforts and
ills, skin problems, and injuris.”

The Health Service, as a Uni-
versity-wide program, began
functing in Brackenridge Hall un-
der Dr. Thompson in 1962. Pre-
viously, men, women, nurses and
medical students visited differ-
ent centers, located in the Cathe-
dral of Learning or Student,
Union.

Today, doctors are on duty 24
hours each day to give regular
and emergency care. All physici-
ans have been out of medical
school at least three to ﬁve years
and most of the day-care doctors
have private practices.

According to a questionnaire
survey conducted several years

Local Hero-Gene Kelly

Succeeds in Show Biz

by MARTHA HARTEL
Attention, all stage, screen and

'-television fans. One of the top

names in the World of today‘s
show business is an alumnus of
the University. He’s Eugene Cur-
ran Kelly, better known as Gene
Kelly—actor, dancer, producer
and director.

Kelly, who was a star half-
back at Pittsburgh’s Peabody
High School, was born in nearby
East Liberty. His mother had been
on the stage as a girl. Mrs. Kelly_
coaxed Gene to attend dancing
school, which he disliked at the
time. Now he recognizes his mo-
ther’s efforts as a blessing.

After high school, Gene came
to the University, working his
way through as a laborer, carpen-
ter’s helper and dancing instruc-

Club and Cap and Gown. At the
same time, the Kelly basement
had been turned into a dancing
school with Mama Kelly as direc-
tor and Gene teaching tap and
dancing.

Kelly graduated in 1933 with
a degree in journalism. Return-
ing to the University to stage
Cap and Gown shows, he caught
the eye of the Pittsburgh Play-
house, which starred him as
dancer and choreographer in
Charles Gaynor’s Review, Hold
Your Hats.

In 1938, he went to New York
City to work as a choreographer,
but instead got a job in Cole Por-
ter’s chorus Leave It to Me.
Three years later; he had his own
starring role in Pal Joey. Since
then, Kelly had gone on to star
in such hits as Singing in the
Rain, Slaughter on Tenth Ave-
nue, For Me and My Gal, and
What a Way to Go.

In 1961, the University award-
ed Gene Kelly an honorary Doc-
tor of Fine Arts. He also won an
Oscar for brilliant achievements
in the art of choreography.

ago by Susan Druckemiller, the
Student Government Health Serv-
ice chairman, most students rated
the Service as good to superior
and not one rated it less than
average, Many of them mention-
ed courteous service.

“Despite such encouraging
news,” said Dr. Thompson, “we
often fall victim to the iceberg
phenomena. The large numbers
of satisﬁed customers remain be-
low the surface. They are cured

or well and do not talk about any I

sickness. Those who are not so
fortunate may not think so kind-
ly of us and voice their opinions.

“We give clinical service,” add-
ed Dr. Thompson, “that, at one-
fourth to one-third the cost,
equals any college health center
and is better than most. We ma y
not be able to satisfy 100 per
cent of the students 100 per cent
of the time, but neither should
people have unreasoned expecta-
tions as to how much and how
quickly the illness can be cured.

“Our place here is to help,” he
continued, “and to educate stu-
dents both the present and fu-

ture. If 100‘ per cent of the grad- ‘

uating class left as non-smokers,
we would have accomplished a
great deal.”

 IS FOR THE MANY THINGS‘
YOU’LL TEACH HER

Nobody will dispute—surely not I—that raising children
is a task which requires full time and awesome skills.
Nonetheless, a recent nationwide survey has revealed a
startling fact: mothers who go back to work after their
children are safely through the early years are notably
happier, better adjusted, and more fulﬁlled than mothers
who simply remain housewives. Moreover—and mark this
well—the children of such working mothers are themselves
happier, better adjusted, and more fulﬁlled!

All very well, you say, but what's it got to do with you ?

Isn't it obvious? If you are underachieving at college, get ‘

your mother a job. *

What kind of job? VVell sir, your mother is probably
between 35 and 50 years of age, so certain occupations
must immediately be ruled.out. Logging, for example. Or
whaling. Or carhopping.

But don't despair. There are other kinds of jobs—not
many, to be sure, but some. However, you must not stick
Mom in just any old job. You must remember that after
the excitement of raising you, she would be bored to tears

~ as a ﬁle clerk, for instance, or as a dolman. (A dolman, as

we all know, is someone who brings handfuls of water to
track layers. With the recent invention of the pail, dolmen
are gradually falling into technological unemployment.)

But I digress. I was saying, ﬁnd Mom a job worthy of
her talents, something challenging that uses her vast wis-
dom and experience but, at the same time, is not too hard
on her obsolescing tissues. That's what Walter Sigafoos
did, and the results were brilliantly successful.

Walter, a sophomore at the Upper Maryland College of
Wickerwork and Belles Lettres, majoring in rafiia, ap-
proached the problem scientiﬁcally. First he asked himself
what his mother did best. Well sir. what she did best was
to keep hollering, “Dress warm, Walter!” ,

At ﬁrst glance this seemed a skill not widely in demand,
but VValter was not discouraged. He sent out hundreds of
inquiries and today, I am pleased to report, his mother is
happily employed as wardrobe mistress for the Montreal
Canadiens. 1

Another fortunate venture was that of Frank C. Grans-
mire, a junior at the Oregon State Conservatory of Music
and Optometry, majoring in sties. Frank, like Walter, did
a survey in depth of his mother's talents. Chief among
them, he found, was her ability to make a roast of beef
feed the whole family for three days. So, naturally, Frank
got her a job at the Museum of Natural History.

What has one to do with the other, you ask? Isn't it
obvious ? Anyone who can stretch ribs like that belongs in
paleontology. »

of shaving, scraps the scrape, negates the nick, repudiates

S Disapproval of Vietnam Policy

DATING,

Nearly three-quarters of
the Princeton faculty disap-
proved of President John-
son’s policy in Vietnam in a
recent poH conducted by the
Daily Princetonian.

Out of the 800 faculty members
sent questionnaires only 260
responded. Seventy-four per cent
of those who responded disap-
proved with President Johnson’s
Vietnam policy, while 25 per
cent approved and one per cent
expressed no opinion.

The bombing of Vietnam was
one of the major reasons for dis-
approval. Seventy per cent were
in favor of immediate suspen-
sion of the bombings.

The heavy military commit-

. ment of the United States in Viet:

nam was the next most heavily
criticized policy, with 69 per cent
disapproving of the current com-
mitment. The opinion was much
varied in response to the ques-
tion of whether or not “the war
in Vietnam is inherently a civil‘
war in which the United States
has no business interferring.”
Fifty-one per cent of the faculty
agreed with the statement while
36 per cent disagreed.
Questions concerning possible
courses of action in Vietnam
gave varied results. of the 260 re-
spondants, 79 per cent felt the
Viet Cong should be included in
peace negotiations and 92 per
cent disagreed with the state.-
ment advocating the United
States invasion of Vietnam. ’
In response to the statement,
“The United States should retain

strategic enclaves in South Viet-
nam without further military
build-up,” 37 per cent indicated
some type of agreement While 41
per cent disagreed with the state-
ment.

In response to the question “If
you Were the President, which
of these courses of action on Viet-

nam would most appeal to you?” ‘

Forty-one per cent wanted to
slow down the ﬁghting, 30 per
cent wanted withdrawal com-
pletely, 17 per cent wanted to
continue as at present, and‘ ﬁve
per cent wanted to step up the
ﬁghting.

Party aﬁiliation had little ef-
fect on the wide variation of
opinions although the Republi-
cans tended to be more militant
than the average, according to
the survey.

W Responsibilities 

  NewFee — Ne

A positive and rational step for the construction of a new Student

' Union has been taken by Student Government. By selecting the possible

and rational means of securing the fun for construction of a Union, the
student senate has markedly advanced the cause of a new center for stu-

‘I ' dents. By calling for a Union fee, the students have stated they are willing

to accept their share of the responsibility. Now it is time for the Uni-
versity administration to give the maximum support necessary for the
completion of this project.

The various possibilities were weighed and the senators found that the

most expedient means would be to charge a fee to the student body, the
. group that will eventually use the building, Such a charge is not an inno-

' ‘ vation in the academic world, and it has been the main source of funds for

many unions including the one at Ohio State University.
Naturally it would be better and less of a burden on the student body

' if the Union pould be from private donations. But it would take many
,sizeable donations and the most recent attempts at securing funds from L
I ' alumni and members of the Pittsburgh community have yielded meager
, results. Moreover the chances of finding a philanthropist to donate the

entire building are extremely slim. . ,
In other institutions, private corporations have. constructed the Stu-

 ‘\

dent Unions, and run them until they have gained certain profits from the
management of the facilities. ‘Then the building becomes the property of
the University. But there are obvious advantages to being free of such a
contractual agreement with a private firm from the very start.

The most attractive alternative was a union fee. Some may argue
that a few classes will be taxed for the construction of a building that will
be used by students for many, many years to come. But iniall probability
the fee will -continue after the building is constructed. The fee will be
used at that point to provide for new equipment and maintenance of the
student center, ‘

The University administration now has two choices. They can easily
let the project flounder bytheir inaction and thus stall the enactment of
the fee. .Or they can realize that the representative body of the students
has done its part and now need the professional help an administration can
give the proponents of a new union. The Union must be worked into the
Master Plan for the Oakland campus, which is presently drawn up. Then
the University must aid in the acquisition of land and naturally will have
to accept the duties of construction and maintenance of the building. The
‘administration has been presented with a proposal which incorporates much

self imposed responsibility for the student. The University now must take‘ .

up its share of the work.

  

The Battle Over LSD _

THE BATTLE over LSD
has been long and loud, but
it is just beginning: The is-
sues now are partly legal and
partly moral, a.nd prob-ably

' ‘will be only partly solved.

But even if LSD were to van-
ish " tomorrow, its inﬂuence

on the past, and more impor--

tantly the future, shall be
with us for a long time.

Advances in the physical
sciences have always been
this way. First they are not
believed, then they are de-
bated away, and ﬁnally they
are suppressed. But slowly,
seeping in and around the
most imperative of preju-
dices, people began to real-
ize that maybe he (the sci-
entist) really has something
there . , .

It happened to Galileo, it

, happened to Freud, and it
‘ will happen to the theory

and practice of psychodelic
drugs.

WHAT IS always ignored,
or, at least not recognized at

the time, are the changes in

world view and orientation as
people come to realize that
the sun really is in the cen-
ter of the Universe, or that
the earth wasn’t really cre-
ated in seven days. They are
busy arguing speciﬁcs.
These eruptions of ideas

/

i'”I‘he.....

are always traumatic, with
the principle blows falling on
the religious establishment
— for obvious reasons. Theo-
logy is the purveyer of the
accepted world view, with
suitable embellishments as
to the indispensibility of the
priesthood. Eventually, ad-
herence to the world-view is

identiﬁed with adherence to

the religion. Theology lives
or dies on its successful ex-
planation of the novel in
terms of the mundane. When
a certain datum simply can-
not be reconciled with al-
ready accepted dogma, it is
declared in error.

But sometimes the theory
is stronger than the dogma,
and then there is hell to pay,
as the two sides heap inquisi-
tions upon oneanother, un-
til a ﬁnal tortured synthesis
is arrived at, and, with it,
a new world-view.

CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY
has been ﬁghting a long hold-
ing action against the dis-
coveries of science. Before
Galileo, God’s domain was
both t-he physical world and
the world of the soul. God
was not only omnipotent but
iiidispensible—nothing hap-
pened without God’s voli-
tion; there was no order
withou_t God. But Galileo,

The Psycliodelic Revolution

by Hobart Harris

and later Newton, changed
this. When their ideas had
ﬁnally come to rest, God had
been relegated to a slightly
less important place —— he
was now the creator of the
physical world, but not its
current choreographer.

But the downgrading of
God’s powers did not stop
here. As the years went by,
geology, and ﬁnally biology,
began to usurp God’s powers,
one by one, The process had
begun with the gross pro-
cesses of cosmology and mo-
tion, but slowly science was
closing in on man, and re-
ligion’s relevance shrank. We
no longer prey for rain —
we seedthe clouds.

God eventually lost the

battle over the physical uni-
verse, and with it control
over iman’s body. For the
last 100 years, religion’s last
line of defense has been the
mind — the one organ that
seems to defy manipulation.
And so it stood—the soul, the
pearl of theology, haughty,
untouched, the proper con-
cern of an enduring God.

AND THIS is where the
true inﬂuence of the psycho-
delic revolution will be felt.
LSD is only the largest part
of it——the revolution includes
all the advances of psycholo-
gy and all of the inferences
of social psychoolgy. But the
effect of LSD is the most
dramatic and immediate dem-
onstration of the fact that

, the mind, and the soul with-

in, are no longer invioble.
The trances, the insights,
the feelings of transcen-
dence, the full sense of
meaning and purpose that
occur as a result of an LSD
session seem to have pre-
sented Christian man with
an alternative God, a comic
experince within himself,
rather than from without.

All that is needed is a su-
gar cube and a chemical any
Chem 15 student can repro-
duce in his sleep. And all
the tra_di_tional paraphenalia
of religion, the beautiful
Cathedrals, the hymns, the
rich mythology, all of those
things that contribute to the
emotional impact of religion,
bulky and unreliable as they
are, can be replaced. If God
is dead, he was drugged.

  
 

SAFAP
Reagan’s

RONALD REAGAN’S re-
cent election as Governor
of California has sparked a
new cult, The cult is called
the Society for the Advance-
ment of Former.Actors

"through Politics (SAFAP).

Its base in in California and
the once small group has had
a 200 per cent increase in
membership in the past two
weeks. '_

A recent SAFAP document
smuggled through a member
in the Students for a Demo-
cratic Society (SDS) gives
an outline of the group’s

elite and their strategy for

a SAFAP coup. “Reagan will
serve as the group’s messiah.
He will be portrayed through
all news media as a charis-
matic leader. His main role
will not be in running
SAFAP, but in combatting
the Kennedy aura,” said the
report.

“His approach will be
guided by the SAFAP core

‘ group which will direct all

propaganda,” the report con-
tinued. “His appeal will be
geared to dissident _elemtnts
in American Society, parti-
cularly those in the rightist
niche. Target groups are:
Parent-Teacher Associations
(PTA), the John Birch So-
ciety, Veterans of Foreign
Wars (VFW), and the
Daughters, Sons, and other
relatives of the American
Revolution (DAR, SAR,
etc.).”

, WHILE THE intent of the
Reagan cult has been be-
coming evident through clan-
destine procurement of
SAFAP documents, few peo-
ple have ascertained the na-
ture of the core group. Em-
phasis is being placed on the
core, because they are the
people who will pull the pup-
pet’s strings.

It is known that the core
group must take secret oaths
and have designed an elabor-
ate initiation ceremony and
internal education program
for those in the lower eche-
lons. One part of the rites in-
clures an oath to “forever
ﬁght for the annihilation of
all Communists and to use
any military resources avail-
able.” The oath also cites a
ﬁrm commitment to “end the
War in Vietnam as a ﬁrst
step to communist annihila-
tion and to retard the prog-

ress of communist encircle-

  

Renewal  
by Bill Cabin

ment of freedom-loving peo-
ples.”

Information on the core
group is piecemeal. Inform-
ed scources reveal high cor-
relation‘ between the timing
and place of SAFAP elite
meetings and the travel plans
of several people, These cor-
relations have been compiled
in the past three months and
show surprising consistency.

AMONG THE high corre-
lates have been General
Dwight Eisenhower and ex-
Presidential canidate Barry
Goldwater. Both have been
in the California-Arizona
hot-spots of SAFAP senti-
ment at times of core group
meetings. The ﬁrst discov-
ery was made in California’s
Death Valley—now the chief
base of operations for the
Reagan cult.

One report cites Goldwater,
Eisenhower, and Reagan ap-
proaching -a Death Valley

rendezvous in wagons drawn _

by mules. Although this re-
port is one of the more ex-
treme distortions by anti-
SAFAPists, there is evidence
the Death Valley meeting
was held.

MORE ACCURATE infor-
mation has been obtained on
the lower echelon members
of SAFAP. These are typic-
ally young, marginal actors
a.nd actresses who believe
SAFAP will give meaning to
their life by projecting them
into politics on the Reagan
spirit. Few know the core
group’s intent to memely use
the actors as ﬁgureheads for
the substantive SAFAP pro-
gram.

Ed “Kookie” Burns, Troy K
. Donahue,

George Maharis,
Annette Funicello and Con-
nie Stevens are several young
grade - B movie stars who
have been openly proclaim-
ing SAFAP sentiments.
More signiﬁcant and the
cause for President John-
son’s concern for SAFAP has
been the rumor that George
Hamilton secretly joined the
group after receiving his
pre-induction physical.

To date there have
been no reports on the anti-
SAFAP activities,’ but one

thing is certain: SAFAP has ’»:-:.\»

gained a foothold and things
W°n’t be thesame anymore-

Anti-VietnamTalk

Editor, Pitt News:

I would like to comment on
last Friday’s anti-Vietnam forum
described in the Pitt News. The
Vietnam conflict is described as
being “Immoral” and “illegal.” If
by this they mean all wars are
“Immoral” and “illegal” then
their view on Vietnam would be
consistant.

But by singling out this con-
ﬂict for their verbal assaults their
arguments become mere rhetoric
with little substance to back
them up. The essence of the con-
ﬂict in Vietnam is similar to the
war in Greece in the late 1940’s,
the Korean War, the Huk Re-
bellion in the Philippines and
many others. It is a case of a
communist dominated minority
movement attempting to take
over a country by subversion
and/or outright aggression.

There are numerous other fac-
tors in Vietnam that complicate
the issue but basically the prin-
ciple involved is the same. Do
we help them, as we helped
others in the past, or just forget
about them? Do we pull out,
leaving the South Vietnamese,
who have fought the Viet Cong
and “friends” for the last decade,
to the none too tender mercies of
Premier Ho and wait for the in-
evitable next war? _

Or shall we try to stick this
thing out and thereby give a tre
mendous boost to the morale of
all the free nations of Asia. Shall

we abdicate our responsibility in b

  

 

Le t t e rs to the

the Pacific and leave a power
vacuum that only China can ﬁll?

In the article, Dr. Cooley is
said to fear attack on “freedom
of expression.” But surely, that
same freedom gives me the right
to protest his protestations, which
I believe injure our efforts to end
the conﬂict by raising hopes in._
Hanoi and we shall waver.

Dr. _Richman seems to believe
we are in Vietnam because all
our aid has not made the South
as rich as the Communist North.
Come now! An economics profes-
sor, of all people should realize
that a large guerilla force "effec-
tively interrupting many vital
government funtions (not to men-
tion eliminating many govern-
ment functionaries) is not exactly
conducive to an economic boom.
This seems to a common fault
among many Vietnam dissenters.
No matter how intelligent they
simply disregard pertinent facts.
They cry “Peace in Vietnam,”
but fail to state at what price
and what conditions. They cry,
“Stop the bombing!”—we have
twice-—but to no avail.

Lacking reasonable arguments
they call the President of the

United States a “murderer” and
his advisers “lackeys.” The U.S.
has made its commitment to Viet-

, nam and all of Asia. we have in

effect said to the communist, “This
far and no further!” If this is ”im-
moral” then I truely ‘fear what
being “moral” would lead to.

 Letters to the Editor

Reader Gives
Parking Ideas

Editor, Pitt News:

In the interest of a more proﬁt-
able City Government, I would
like to offer a few suggestions
for revision of the parking reg-
ulations in the Pitt campus area.

I think the idea of four hour
meters in the Oakland area is
absurd. Instead of offering stu-
dents the opportunity of parking
four hours at a time, why not
change the time limit to 45 min-
utes. This gives our lovely meter
maids the opportunity of ﬁlling
their quotient of tickets much
earlier in the month and thus af-
ford them more leisure time to
pursue their multitudinous intel-
lectual endeavors.

In fact why not have street
cleaning every day of the week
from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.? After all,
the same amount of cleaning
would be done and the tickets
would more than pay for the cost
of the signs.

Alumni Dislikes
Campus Image

. Editor, Pitt News:

This past week-end I was in
the Pittsburgh area scouting lo-
cations for a motion picture and
decided to treat my associates to
a visit and tour of my alma ma-
ter, PITT, and its campus.

I was amazed to ﬁnd the once
beautiful landscaped gardens sur-
rounding the Cathedral and
Heinz Chapel were ideally suit-

ed to ﬁlm on-location sequences
for the television series, “The
Rat Patrol.”

A tour of the Commons Room re-
quired kicking one’s way through
dirt and debris to ﬁnd the In-
ternational Rooms. The unique
charm and decor of these rooms
has been greatly enhanced by the
beautifully executed designs of
the prominently displayed “No
Smoking” signs.

The Student Union lounge areas
were magniﬁcent with the rag-
ged lampshades, greasy windows
and mirrors ﬁlthy enough to
match the carpets.

I stopped the tour there . . .
noting to my associates that if
we ever needed a setting for a

ACLU Asks
For Snub
Of HCUA

(Continued from Page 1)
came in the wake of the HUAC’s
subpoenas of membership lists
at the University of Michigan
and at the University of Califor-
nia at Berkeley last summer
which the ACLU termed “one of
the most serious breaches of aca-
demic freedom of students in re-
cent decades, not excluding the
McCarthy era.”

In 3' letter to the heads of col-
leges who are members of the
American Association of Colleges,
the Union’s executive director,
John de J. Pemberton,Jr., and its
Academic Freedom Committee
chairman, Professor Samuel Hen-
del, warned that the HUAC’s sub-
poena action is “a deﬁnite threat
to academic freedom,” adding
that “it asserts the intimidating
power of an official investigating
body armed with compulsory pro-
cess.” , '

The Committee’s subpoenas
pelled the Union to make a just-
completed survey of its 39 affi-
liates throughout the country, on
the extent of HUAC campus in-
vestigations of anti-war groups.
As‘. a result of its survey, the
ACLU said that “While at pre
sent we have no information that
HUAC intends to extend its in-
vestigations to other universities,
obviously this continues as a real
and overhanging threat.”

The ACLU’s call for opposition
to the Committee’s “violation of
the guarantees of the First
Amendment” came after the sub-
poenas were issued last summer
at the two universities in connec-

tion with the HUAC’s probe of

peace groups opposing American
participation in the Vietnam war._

University of Michigan author-
ities delivered lists containing 65
names drawn from three organi-
zations — an affiliate of Students
for a Democratic Society, a Com-
mittee to Aid the Vietnamese,
and a local chapter of the WEB.
DuBois Club. The Union noted
that “these lists were sent with-
out ﬁrst advising those named so
that they at least might have
had the opportunity to seek legal-
ly to enjoin the university from
complying.”

The Union spokesmen called on
university leaders to take cer-
tain steps against the danger
posed by the HUAC action. Urg-
ing the colleges to “resist, in
every possible legal manner, sub-
poenas seeking membership lists,”
the ACLU said there is strong
likelihood that if universities did
contest a subpoena in the courts
such a challenge would be up-
held. In support of its position
the Union cited several Supreme
Court decisions which uphold the
Drivacy of organization member-
ship lists.

In a gT0up of cases involving
attempts by state authorities in
the South to secure NAACP mem.
bership lists, the ACLU noted
that the high court supported
the civil rights group’s refusal
to comply with a compulsory dis.
closure which would be a “re-
Straint 011 freedom of associa-
tion.”

The ACLU declared that the
infringement of academic free-
dom involved in the subpoenas
of student membership and offi-
cer lists as “so pernicious an at-
tack on academic freedom that,
if called upon, it is prepared to
lend legal assistance to its resis.
tance.”

To “safeguard jealously the
tradition of free inquiry and de.
bate” at institutions of higher
learning, the ACLU urged uni-

Carnegie Tech Announces
Tuition Increase of $250

Earlier this week Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology announced
a tuition increase of $250 for the
next academic year.

The raise makes tuition $1950
per year and put Carnegie Tech
into the-distinction of having one
of the highest tuition rates in the
nation—comparable to Ivy League
schools-and other nationally known
engineering and science schools.
and other nationally known engi-
neering and science schools.

In a letter to students, parents,
and friends of Carnegie Tech,
President H. Guyford Stever said,
“This decision results from a care-
full examination of rising costs of
high quality education and reaf-
firmation of our determination not
to incur budget deficits.”

While announcing the tuition in.
crease, Carnegie Tech officials al-
so mentioned plans to increase aid
to students. At present, about thir-

 
 
 
 
 
   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

ty per cent of Carnegie Tech’s full-
time undergraduates and almost
all of its graduate students receive
some sort of financial aid.

Income from tuition amounts to
a little more than 50 per cent of
the direct cost of education. The
remainder of Carnegie Tech’s in-
come comes from gifts, grants, and
endowments.

HOWARD HUGHES DOCTORAL FELLOWS]-IIPS. Applica-
tions for the Howard_Hughes Doctoral Fellowships in engineer-
ing, physics, or mathematics are now available for the academic
year beginning in Autumn 1967. '

The program offers the qualified candidate an outstanding
opportunity for study and research at a selected university, plus
professional industrial summer experience at a Hughes facility.
Each Doctoral Fellowship includes tuition, books and thesis
preparation expenses, plus stipend ranging from $2,200 to
$3,100, depending upon the Program year and the number of
candidate's dependents. Full salary is paid the Fellow during his
summer work at Hughes. Salaries are reviewed periodically and
increased with the growth of the individual. Fellowships are
awarded to outstanding students who have completed a master's
degree (or equivalent) and have been accepted as a candidate
for the doctoral degree. ’

HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. Approximately 100
new awards for '67-'68 are available to qualified applicants with

. a baccalaureate degree in engineering, mathematics or physics.

Most of these awards are Work-Study Fellowships; a very lim-
ited number are Full-Study. Upon completion of the Masters
Program, Fellows are eligible to apply for and are given special
consideration for a Hughes Doctoral Fellowship.

Fellows who associate with a Company facility in the Los Angeles
area usually attend the University of Southern California or the
University of California, Los Angeles. Tuition, books and other
academic expenses are paid by the Company, plus a stipend
ranging from $500 to $850 for the academic year. A significant
advantage offered by the Work-Study Program is the opportunity
to acquire professionalexperience working with highly compe-
tent engineers and scientists while pursuing the M.S. degree.
Selected Fellows have the option to work in several different
assignments during the Fellowship period to help them decide

Programs  

    

on their field of ‘concentration and optimum work assignment.

Fellowsearn full salary during the summer and pro-rata salary
for 24 hours work a week during the academic year. The com-
bined salary and stipend enables Fellow to enjoy an income in
excess of $6,500 per year during his two years as a Work-Study
Fellow. Salaries are increased commensurate with professional
growth and Fellows are eligible for regular Company benefits.

Work assignments are matched closely to the Fel|ow's interests.
Primary emphasis at Hughes is research and development in
the field of electronics for application to defense systems and
space technology. Fields of interest include stability and trajec-
tory analysis, energy conversion, structural design and analysis
—computer and reliability technology, circuit and information
theory, plasma electronics, microminiaturization, and human
factor analysis — research, development and product design on
such devices as parametric amplifiers, masers and lasers, micro-
wave tubes, antenna arrays, electron-tube and solid-state dis-
plays, and components —design analysis, integration and test-
ing of space and airborne missile and vehicle systems, infrared
search and tracking systems, and computer, data processing
and display systems--theoretical and experimental work in
solid-state and ion physics.

‘Citizenship: United States citizenship is required.

Closing date for all applications: Early application is advis-
able. All materials should be postmarked not later than February
1 for the Doctoral Fellowships, and March 1 for the Masters
Fellowships. '

Trimester .
Taxes Exams 
In Michigan 

KALMAZOO, Mich. (IP)—Tel1-  
ing faculty members at Western 3‘
Michigan University that they
should de-emphasize ﬁnal exam-
inations, Dr. Russell Siebert, vice-
president for academic affairs,

.4

" said that the switch to the tri-

mester plan had resulted in the
elimination of the ten-day exam-
ination period, and students were 
often forced to take several exams A
in one day.

Many students had complained.
about the stress at examination ' 
time last year, and Dr. Seibert’.s ” "
recommendations seemed to be
aimed‘ at clearing up this prob-
lem. He said that instructors
should put more stress on short, V
frequent tests, and cover areas’ 
thoroughly.

He also asked faculty to ob-
serve a “gent1eman’s agreement”
and require students to turn in
term papers two weeks before
the semester ends. This measure
again was urged to prevent the
overburdening of students at the . p
end of the semester. ‘

In closing, Dr. Seibert indi- .
cated that WMU has very few 1 .
problems in switching to the tri- " _
master, and the examination per- . ‘ 1‘
iod was the largest one encoun- 
tered so far. He believes that the A
lack of difficulties stems from 
the fact that Western studied,“ 
closely all the aspects of the tri- -
mester program. ‘_

A unique feature of Western’s 
trimester is‘ that it consists of ‘~
two 15-week semesters, and the
third semester is divided into two it 
seven and one-half week sessions. 
The ﬁrst of these short sessions. '-
lasts until about June 15, which 1 ‘
is the approximate time that ‘
other universities are closing for?
the summer. 

“Hence, the University is reor- '
ganizing its provisions for the —
stimulation and facilitation of in- K
terdisciplinary research pro-T 
grams over the entire scope of». 
competence of its faculties. The 
invaluable experience gained ; 
through the mechanism of the 
Institute for Cooperative Re- .5
search suggests changes in the‘. 
present r e sea rc h. coordinating ' 5 73
structure. ‘ _

“These will include the estab-‘ ~..
lishment of a facultyibodychosen. 
from a wide group of depart- ,’
ments which will be charged with 
stimulating and facilitating re-- 
search programs of the faculty‘ v Q
with particular reference to those ‘ 
of an interdisciplinary nature.”

South Bend, Ind., for the Notre
Dame game. His arm was so sore.
he realized that he 'wouldn’t have
a chance to play quarterback the
following day. He was going along
because the coaches were scared
—scared that Bob Bazylak and
Mike Elliott might both be knock-
ed out of the game leaving no
one to direct the Panthers.

‘Last week in Miami, James’
arm was still sore. The doctors
had told him to rest it but he
just couldn’t afford the inactiv-
ity. He had to throw the ball in
practice for there was no one
else besides Bazlak to run the
patterns.

Bazylak, however, ran into trou-
ble moving the team in Miami
and the coaches must have de-
cided that sore arm or not James
would have to play. At the start
of the third quarter, Eddie was

Quarterback E d James

  Doesn’t Yell or Scream
But Walks with Pride

by TOM SACKS, Sports Editor

Eddie James was walking down the corridor of the
Pittsburgh a'irport_ He flicked his right arrr}, qulfkly 
ing from the pain, and saying at the same time, I cou dn
throw the football more than 10 yards right now.”

That was two weeks ago and James was on his way to

he went into the game, com-
pleted ﬁve out of nine P515593.
and guided the Panthers to a try-
to - make - the - score respectable
touchdown.

He did this inspite of a com-
ment that would have made most
people bitter. It was a comment
from his coach, Dave Hart, which
had been misinterpreted by this
city’s newspapers. Hart had been
quoted as saying, “We’Ve made a
mistake with Bazylak. He should
have been starting all year.”

What -I-Iart had meant was that
they had made a mistake in not
even giving" Bazylak a chance at
the beginning of the year. But
that’s not what came out in pub-
lic and James had been hurt.

As Eddie says, “When you’re
1-8, you have to keep your con-
ﬁdence in yourself. After the
UCLA game, I had faith in the
coaches and I thought they had
faith in me. When I saw coach
Hart’s statement, I hadn’t been
playing for two weeks because of
this injury and I just didn’t un-
derstand it. -

“I don’t think he wants to de
liberately hurt anybody like that.
He explained to me what he had
actually meant and I told him
that people who know football
would understand what he meant
but that most people wouldn't.”

James and Hart understand
each other again now and Eddie
will be starting in tomorrow's
Penn State game. To most cynics
being the starting quarterback of
a team which is 1-8 wouldn’t
seem like much of an honor. But
to James it is.

“I know people don’t want to
hear about losers, but in the fu-
ture I’ll still remember that I
was the ﬁrst team quarterback
of the University of Pittsburgh.
I love football. The game has
treated me well. This is as far
as I’ve wanted to go and I’m still
proud I played for Pitt. I’ll never
be embarrassed of being quar-
terback of a big name school.”

James has not always looked at
football with that same attitude,
however. He has aged a great

deal between the time he was‘

the senior quarterback of a 9-0-1
New Castle team and the time
that he was sitting in the lobby
of a San Francisco hotel last
month talking about life and
football.

At New Castle he was the quar-
terback of a team that had gain.
ed over 1,000 yards in the air.
His fullback and halfback made
All-State. but he didn’t even
make his ﬁrst team All-Section,

“It hurt me an awful lot then.
I just didn’t know what I had
to do and I moped around for
two years because of it. I’ve nev-
er made anything in my life. And
when I used to think of who
makes what I used to wonder.
Take Terry Hanratty. I don’t
think he’s that much better than
I am right now but he’s been on
the covers of two national mag-
azmes.

“I’ve stopped wondering now,
In the Past my goals weren’t the
right ones and I used to get down.
in the dumps. You have to feel
that sense of achievement within
yourself. 'I'hat’s what counts.”

As far as James is concerned,
he still doesn’t think that this
year’s Panthers are as bad as
the record. “We’ve been beaten,
but we haven’t been runover,
I’ve actually felt we could win
every game we’ve played in and

 Panthers Engage Penn State;
Old lronsides Up For Grabs

C3

x.‘/'

ll

by GEORGE LIES
For the sixty-sixth time,
the Panthers engage the Nit-
tany Lions of Penn State.

And whether or not some peo-
ple stay home and watch the

televised game between the num- ,

her one and the number two
teams in the country, there are
answers to questions the (possi-
bly high - strung, upset - minded)
Homecoming crowd should look
for in the Stadium tomorrow at
1:30 p.m.

Two of them are: Who is the
better receiver, Bob Longo or
Jack Curry? Who is the better
1inebacker,, Jim Flanigan or
John Runnels?

A third question concerns Old
Ironsides. It is a trophy which is
emblematic of football suprema-
cy between West Virginia, Penn
State, and the Panthers. Since
its adoption in 1955, State has ei-
ther held or shared the trophy
every year but one. The Moun-
taineers, having lost to both
teams, are out of the competition.
Tomorrow's victor takes home
the trophy.

The importance of the game

lies with the third question, but
the other two are pertainent on
a smaller scale.

 

DAN LUCYK
Fullback averages 5.6 yards.

 

BOB CAMPBELL
S'oplz wingback averages 6.3 yards.

As to the better receiver, both
Longo and Curry are juniors and
both are looking to break more
school records next season.

-Longo has the edge over Cur-

r,v in the statistic department.

He has caught 39 passes for 585
yards while Curry shows 30 re-

ceptions for 501 yards. Longo has —

scored four touchdowns; Curry
none. However, the Panthers
have gone to the air—lanes .63
more times than the grind-it-out
Penn Staters.

“State shifts from an I-forma-

tion and splits wide one end,,

usually Curry,” said coach Frank‘
Cignetti who scouted the Lions.
“He is not exceptionally speedy,
but he has ﬁne hands and runs
patterns well.’’ ’

“After bad breaks in a few
games, I was glad to see Bobby
Longo go after the ball and catch
a few against Miami,” said coach

Dave Hart. “I think it built up .

his morale again.
“Last year he caught six pass-
es against them,” continued Hart.

“And he causes problems for 4

Penn State.” . -

dates in pre-season press releases.
Defensively in their last game,
both put in strong bids for rec-
ognition. Flanigan made seven
individual tackles, assisted on 12
others, and recovered a fumble.
Runnells was credited with 12
individual tackles, intercepted a
pass, and knocked down two
others. 5

“I’ll be surprised if he‘ doesn't
at least make All-East this sea-
son,”., said Hart of -Flanigan.

ed Runnels for his efforts against.

with a 1-6-2 mark, the worst rec-
ord in its soccer history. The
booters own 3-6-1 record is one
of the poorest they have had
since coach Leo Bemis founded
the sport here 13 years ago.

The key to the booters’ down-
fall has been the lack of an of-
fensive scoring punch. “If they
could score more,” said Bemis,
“they would take some of the
pressure 011‘ the defense. When
you’re pressured so much, you
are bound to get scored on.”

Despite the constant pressure,
Bemis has been pleased with his
defense. “They have done an ade-
quate job overall. If we could
just make two good passes in a
row on offense, and score a lit-
tle, it would have been a differ-
ent story.”

An ominous note for the boot-
ers was sounded when Penn
State tied Bucknell, who shutout
the soccer team last week. But,
Bemis writes off the loss to Buck-
nell as “one of those things. We

Bemis hopes that the Forbes

booters need against State.

Another Day

.Tomorrow’s Contest

Dud for Pennsylvania-

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

For Pitt and Penn State the world will not be a bowl of
cherries tomorrow. As a matter of fact, all tomorrow will
be is the final football game of the season for two losers. -.

It’s quite a comedown for two schools that in the past
have been considered the powerhouses of Eastern football,
The combined 5-13 record of the two teams is the worst that
has ever been brought into the series which dates back to

..  1893. .

To make matters worse a game on tele-

' - ‘vision will cut into attendance by roughly
‘ 12,000 and if it weren’t for the fact that it

‘ is homecoming the figure would probably
be higher. _
That game on TV matches. Notre Dame
and Michigan State in what some have~~-al-
ready billed the college game of the century.

Looking behind the scenes that game also

, reveals a good deal about the Pennsylvania
rivalry which will be so inconspicuous tomorrow.

For the simple fact is that both Pitt and Penn State

,have been out-recruited by non-Pennsy, schools in recent

' years! The Panthers more so than State.

People can moan all they want about high admissions
standards, but the moaning has ‘a false ring. For the stan-

_dards of both Universities have not risen that drastically
to exclude the admission of some of the state’s top athletes.

Rip Engle, former Nittany Lion head coach, has writ-
ten off the dismal year for Pennsylvania schools as just
one of those cycles. Nothing is inevitable, however, and

—most cycles are created through man-made errors or what
have you-. .

Despite the present, the future is not that bleak. Coach
Dave Hart, for one, intends to do something about it. He

has to if he wishes to survive as the head football coach
here, Already this fall he and his staff have seen 139 high
school football games in the Western Pennsylvania area.

“Every boy that we talk to initially wants to come to
either Pitt or Penn State,” says Hart. “We aim to get to
that point where Pitt and Penn State have this area com-
pletely wrapped up. We don’t want one boy to be talked
into going out of -state,” i

During the season several of Hart’s comments concern-
ing this year’s freshman team have created quite a bit of
unrest among the varsity. He recently tried to rectify mat-
ters with, “I haven’t meant to insult our varsity by saying
that we have freshmen who could be playing for us now.
But facts are facts. ‘We do have freshmen who are faster
and more mobile and we need a lot more like them.”

The question arises whether there is any easy solution
besides the mandatory recruiting good will tours.

"One is the hiring of a full-time recruiter to ease the
burden of the coaches. Indications are that this possibility
will become a reality in the near future.

. Another is redshirting. Hart, among others, has asked
that the non-redshirting ban be dropped to allow at least
six annual cases. Indications are that this blanket permis-
sion will not be granted.

individual cases granting a boy an extra year would be
beneficial. The important point, is that it would be bene-
ficial for the boy and not just the University’s football
team. There are some athletes who are sincere students
‘ needing that ﬁfth year and Athletic Director Frank Carver
is currently planning to propose the names of two seniors
as extension cases at the December meeting of Syracuse,
State, W V U and Pitt.

The remaining possibility to improve the football pro-
gram is the raising of the number of scholarships from 100
in a four year period to 120.

Hopefully, tomorrow’s game will augar bigger things to
come.

The Eps defense held Pi Lam

 Harriers End Season;

Finish High in IC4A’s

by ANDY SWARTZ

The 1966 cross-country team is history, and as coach

Jim Banner said, “The University has a lot to be proud of.”

The harriers finished thirteenth last Monday at the IC4A
cross-country run in New York. I

-.24

Lg}

  

Finishing in the upper third
of the schools, they once again
were led by Frank Handelman,
who placed 37th out of 200 par-
ticipants.

Handelman ran the difficult
ﬁve mile course in 25:50 which
was a little over_a minute slow-
er than the first place ﬁnish of
Joe Messenger from Villanova.
Villanova won the meet, thereby
remaning the perennial cham-
pions of the East.

The harriers were more-or-less
outclassed by the big name schools
who recruit the best talent every
year. Banner said, “It was a real
quality meet, including boys who
will be running in the Olympics
participating in the meet.”

Although the times of all ﬁve
of the harriers were consistent
with their times during the reg-
ular season, coach Banner felt
that their times could have been
better. Following Handelman
were Paul Greig, Larry Hubner,
Ken Lawton, and Fran Shor.

This was Handelman, Hubner,
and Shor’s ﬁnal meet for the
harriers. Looking back on the»
season, coach Banner said. “The
five boys have done a tremen-
dous job all season. They have
run when they were sick or in-
jured and have not let up through
the entire season. The boys real-
ized they were all Pitt had in
this sport and gave 100 per cent
all season.” ,

Freshman Paul Zinc ran in the
Junior Division of the IC4A last
Monday and ﬁnished 23rd out of
150 runners. “Zinc has the abil-

ity to be one of the greatest dis-
tance runners the University has
ever had.’ Coach Banner’s praise
for Zinc is justiﬁed by his times
being nearly as good as those of
the varsity runners.

Next season, only two varsity
lettermen, Paul Greig and Ken
Lawton, will be returning. How-
ever with the addition of Zinc
and Jay Jensen the harriers
promise to have another good
season.

Banner is hoping for more boys
participating on the cross-coun-
try team than the minimum of ﬁve
on this year’s team. As it stands
now, the harriers have only
four boys returning next year
and unless some of the track
men go out, the distance team
will again lack the depth need-
ed for an outstanding season.

A tight defense won for the “A”
League champions and put Delta
Iota Delta into the B League title
game. Again on Wednesday, the
DID's defensive unit dominated as
they held Lambda Sigma Rho
scoreless and took the title 14-0.

The winning defense was mark-
ed by tight coverage on the Laser
ends and pressure on the losers’
quarterback.

Interceptions by Nick Cernanski,
Ch;'.ck Gerstburgcr and Russ Pfeil
combined with the rushing of
Charles Thomas and Tom Cercairo
to keep the Lasers in a hole
tnroughott the game.

Meanwhile, the DID offense was
getting the job done. Short scor.
ing passes from quarterback Lar-
ry Lesniak to Joe Diederich and
Mark Zovko capped long drives
in the second and fourth periods.
Halibacks Tim Reade] and Dori-
an Arlett provided an almost in-

the DIDs played an excellent ball

Cagers Shape Up

by JAY ROSENSTEIN

It’s about now that time
gets short for college basket-
ball coaches. Most teams
swing into the regular sea-
son right after the Thanks-
giving break. 'I'hat’s less than
two weeks away.

The Panther basketball team
opens its 25 game schedule Dec.
1 against Carnegie Tech. The
cagers, however, will ﬁrst play
in the second annual Hall of
Fame game this Tuesday night
against the freshmen. Game time
at the Field House is 8 p.m. and
admission for students is free.

Coach Bob Timmons has been
getting the varsity in shape since
they began serious workouts
about a month ago. With the type
of basketball he has planned for
them, physical conditioning is of
prime importance.

According to assistant coach
Brian Generalovich, former Pan-
ther great, individual work is
stressed now, as the types of of-
fenses and defenses to be used
are formulated.

“The defense will depend, of
course, on the team we play that’
game,” he said. “But we’ll be
switching to a zone press or a
man to man full court press when
the situation requires.”

Because of increased bench
strength this season, Timmons will
have the manpower to be able to
play a pressing ‘defense. The only
question is whether the ﬁve sopho-
mores in the ten “revolving"
starters can react correctly while
working that type of defense.

“They’re inexperienced,” ad-
mitted Generalovich. “And they
won’t be able V to do that right
away. It will be after the ﬁrsé
three or four games before we
see what we’ve got.”

As of now, two sophomores are
in the starting lineup, Len Ka-
lata at forward and Tony Deli-
sio at guard. Junior Ken Bollens
is at the other forward spot on
the “Blue” team with seniors Jim
LaValley at center and Stan Fal-
enski quarterbacking the team
in the backcourt.

Timmons has been shuffling A1
DiFrischia, another sophomore,
with Kalata up front. Sylvestor
Stevenson is currently the fourth
forward, Bob Thompson backs up
LaValley at center and Pete Smith
and Tim Fisher round out “Gold”
unit.

“We have .a well-balanced ball
club.” Generalovich likes to point

out.

JIM LaVALLEY drives for the basket against Penn in a game last
season. The Panther basketball team is counting on I.aValley (6’-6”)
to initiate their fast-breaking attack by grabbing, his share of the

defensive rebounds.

“It’ll be a control club, he add-
ed. “We're not big enough to run
and shoot right away because we
don't have the players to tap in
the shots. Instead we’ll get over
the ten second line in a hurry
and then take the percentage
shot.”

This doesn’t mean that the
basketball team won’t fast break
every chance they get. They will.
But it does indicate that they’ll
try not to give the ball back right
away.

Timmons, having lost a. team-
leader in sophomore Dave Welty,

to Ship Out

story read like a Pitt publicity

who decided to concentrate on
baseball, has been grooming Fal-
enski for the take-charge role.
“Stan, has had the experience,”
Timmons explains. “But he’s by
nature a quiet kid and we’re go-
ing to have to get him to talk.
We'll miss Welty because he
knew how ‘to set up a ball club.”
In general, however, the fu-
ture looks good for Panther bas-
ketball. A past issue of Dell
Sports listed the most promising
sophomores in the East and the

release.

Fresh Hoopsters Hope
Balance Provides Wins

by MHKE BROURMAN
Superstars dominate the headlines, but the well bal-
anced teams like Kentucky win basketball championships.
Coach Tim Grgurich doesn’t promise a national champion-

,ship from his freshman hoop-

sters, but he does have a bal-
anced club that augers Well f0I‘
Panther basketball in the future.
’ If three words were used to
describe this years team, they
would be big, continental, and
winning.

Last year’s frosh were good
but small. Grgurich calls this
group, “Bigger and stronger but
with the same aggressiveness and
hustle. Their defense is just as
touch as last year, and they run
just as much.”

Leading the size parade is
Charles Hunt, who at 6"!” is
“just about the biggest kid~we’ve
everhad here,” according to
Grgurich. Only two inches short-
er than Hunt, at 6’5” is Bob Mc-
Farland, and an inch shorter than
him is Mike Patcher.

The continental approach is
another innovation in this year’s
frosh Cubs. Hunt and McFarland
both hail from Indiana, long re-
nowned for its high school bas-
ketball. Petrini is from Wash-
ington, D. C., and attended De-
Matha Catholic High School, a
national power. ~

The Pennsylvanians on the ros-
ter are mainly winners, and that
fact is probably the most impres-
sive about this year’s team. Nor-
win High School went to the
WPIAL tournament last year due
largely to Paul Naponick who
averaged 28 points a game and
received All State honors.

None of the other freshmen
have that high a scoring average,
but they do have winning tradi-
tions on balanced clubs.

McFarland was a starter on
the Indiana state champions, and
made the state All-Tournament
team. Hunt was the leading re-
bounder for an Indiana team
that reached the sectional cham-
pionships.

Patcher averaged 15 points in
helping Bishop McCourt to the

Pa. State Catholic Championship,

Petrini was All-Metropolitan and
All-Catholic at De Matha.

In fact,the four schools of the
scholarship players, Hunt, Mc-
Farland, Patcher and Petrini, had

a combined record of 98-10.

studies and government intelli-
gence-gathering.”

“One of the necessities for
sound anthropological ﬁeld re-

search,” explained Dr. John P.
Gillin, president of the Associa-
tion, “is that the scholars in-
volved in such work abroad have
the conﬁdence of the people in
the country where the study is
taking place. To do this, a clear
distinction must be made between
scholarly enterprises and other
kinds of activities.”

An analysis, which explores the
extent of anthropologists’ involve-
ment in non-scholarly work and
recommends future guidelines for
ﬁeld research, was prepared by
Professor Ralph Beals of the Uni-

Men’s Frosh Council

Holds First Meeting

Men’s Freshmen Council held
its ﬁrst meeting of the year Tues-
‘day evening at Johnny Garneau’s
Restaurant in Monroeville.

Basil Zitelli, Student Govern-
ment senator and vice—president,
of Men’s Council, spoke about
the opportunities and advantages
in participating in student activ-
ities on campus. Discussing the
importance of a well rounded ed-
ucation, he pointed out that much
can be gained, in terms of experi-
ence, by taking an active part in
student affairs.

Members from last year's coun-
cil attended the meeting in order
to get acquainted with new coun-
cil members and to discuss ideas
for the coming year.

what about the taste of Sprite? It's good. It's
clean. However, good clean things may not exactly be
your idea of jollies. In that case, remember that
Sprite is also very refreshing. "Tart and tingling,"
in fact. And very collegiate. And maybe we'd better
So here it is. The Drinking

this fall. The proposal, as ap-
proved by the faculty in the fol-
lowing form, states:

“At registration a junior or
senior may elect as part of reg-
ular full time program one-half
or one full course, not offered or
required by his major depart-
ment and not fulﬁlling one of his
basic requirements, in- which he
may request to be graded with
either ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail.’ This elec-

not subsequently be changed.
“Full credit will be granted for

as ‘Pass.’ No credit will be grant-
ed for .a course graded as ‘Fail,’
and ‘Fail.’ will have the same ef-
fects upon academic standings as
the regular grade of ‘F.’ ' i

“In the deterrrlination of aver-
ages, rank etc., ‘Pass’ will have
no quality point value, and such
determination will be based up-.
on the regular letter grades re-
ceived.”

An amendment of the proposal
placed the “Pass-Fai1” option on
a two-year trial basis with a re-
view at the end of that time.

Trinity this year has also in-
stituted changes in the time and
scheduling of semester examina-
tions and comprehensives.

The new plan schedules three
two-hour exams per day over a
seven day period, and changes,
the comprehensive exams for
seniors to the end of the Trinity
term. It also includes the exemp-
tion of seniors from ﬁnal exams.
at the end of their last term, and
the setting of a deadline on all
theses and long-term papers.

Dean of Students Roy Heath, a
member “of the committee that

 

tion, having once been made, may’

a course which has been graded '

recommended that the changes

   
 

L. A. Cabinet SuggestsSystem

be adopted, stated that the sen-.
iors’ comprehensives were.set at
a later date than in the past to

place them as “the climax of the- ‘

student’s academic experience at
the College.”
The addition of -a due date for

papers, he- explained, was an ex- .

pression of the teachers’ concern
that students have a. maximum
of time to prepare for their ex-
aminations. The shortening of the
exam period,‘ he continued, came
as a. solution to the problem
caused by the moving up of grad-I

uation from the second to, the ‘

first Sunday in June. »

These changes have resulted in
mixed campus reaction. James
A. Notopoulos, professor of class-'
ics, was f‘non-coI'nmita1” over the
issue of the shortening of the
exam period. He stated, however,‘
that one of the effects of the
change would be more hourly
exams.

‘Grave’ Situation for Proposed DormSite

by BERNIE MeLEOD

' On one end stands a WQED Tower, on the other Trees
Hall. In between lies the German Lutheran Cemetery, with
gravestones dating back to the early eighteen hundreds. Ac-
cording to Captain William Fischer, director of the Phys-
ical Plant, this cemetery is presently the best possible site

on which to build the proposed University dorms.
The seven acres, including many toppled down grave-
stones, trees, and a caretaker’s house, is located on the hill,
approximately one-half mile from the Cathedral of Learn-

'\..I

APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF MILE from the lower campus, the
German Lutheran cemetery overlooks both Pitt Stadium and the

 

Cathedral of Learning.

ing. Nonetheless, Captain Fisher,
feels that the site is not unduely
far from the University's hub.

“None of these decisions are
made without a great deal of
thought,” said Fischer. Although
it means a climb for some stu-
dents, at least they do not have
to go as far as people at Penn
State. There. the new dorms are
being constructed three-quarters
of a mile away from Old Main,
the center of their University.”

To test how much time and ef-
fort students will be spending in
getting to and from the Cathe-
dral, Captain Fischer and others
in the Physical Plant have been
taking timed hikes.

“I’m a grandfather,” he remark-
ed, “and I got up and back in 13
minutes. One of the other men

who took the walk reached the‘

cemetery in 11 minutes and was
back down in ten minutes and
ﬁve seconds.”

“The men who live in the pro-
posed dorms will have one ad-
vantage if being right next door
to excellent recreational facili-
ties,” he continued. People at their
age need a place to let off steam,
as shown by the frequent foot-
ball games on the Cathedral
Lawn. Trees Tall is right next
door.”

Fisher cites advantage as the
availability of parking in the area.
Enough land should be left over
from the actual constructitn area
-for a four hundred car parking
lot.

According to Fisher, the legal
Drocedings involved in moving
the graves are not a great prob-
lem. The University already towns

strips of the cemetery on which |

is built Trees Hall and a playing
ﬁeld. Trees Hall was once even
planned to be built on top of the
cemetery. The University has the
option to buy out all of the land,
and then will assume the expense
of moving the graves to a ﬁrst-
grade cemetery in Pittsburgh.
“We should try and forget about
the site as a tumbledown ceme-
tery,” said Fischer. “Actually,

residents up there on one of the

highest spots in Oakland, will en-
joy a wonderful view of the city.”-
