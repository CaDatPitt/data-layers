Alter only two years, IKE is sent away

Brett Taylor ‘
News Asslstant
Though IKE died more than ﬁve
months ago, tl1ey've just started to cart his
remains from the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union lobby.

Only his skeleton is left, stuffed in the '

comer near the information desk

IKE, the Interactive Kiosk Experience,
was an infonnation computer terminal that
once beeped and chattered from three com-
puter screens while spewing entertainment
and sports info to whomever would rub his
screen.

Now all that remains is the metal frame
that once housed this info-tainrnent triclops.

But for most of last spring, IKE‘s info
grew stagnant. For example, it offered the
same movie commercials and the same
album previews. IKE was showing the
symptoms of corporatus mortem — the
company that ran him was going out of
business.

Born in June of 1995, IKE was provid-

ed free to the University by Campus‘

Interaction, a company based in  Fla
According‘ to Joe Cavalla, Director of

Student Activities, when Campus Interaction
went out of business in June 1997, Pitt was
stuck with the computers.

In order to cut the losses of going out of
business, Campus Interaction olfered to sell
the computers to Pitt, but Pitt had no use for
them, Cavalla said.

But there is life after death for IKE.
Semester at Sea purchased his parts in

. October and put them to use on the cruise

ship.
Sal Moschella, the information systems
coordinator for Semester at Sea, said SAS
purchased three computers, three 25-inch
monitors, two laser printers and some
modems, all for about $3,000.

Two of the computers are in service in
computer labs on board the ship. The rest of

«the equipment is used in the SAS oﬂice to

expand its website.

But recycling IKE had its pitfalls. ‘The
computers are "rnid-range" as far as comput-
ers go these days, according to Moschella

The fact that IKE was provided free to
Pitt by Campus Interaction meant the rev-
enue to keep the company aﬂoat came ﬁom

national and local advertisements including
movie previews and record reviews that
were broadcast on the computer screens.

In addition to advertisements, the
screens could be programmed to display
daily events occurring on campus, as well
national news. ,

Chrissy Roman, an information desk
attendant in the Union, said that IKE suf-
fered from more than corporate downfall.
Though she worked just a few feet from

IKE, she says most people could not relate to
her colossal metal competitor.

"I've been here for three years, and I've
never seen it working," she said. "So it real-
ly didn't effect my job."

Cavalla, on the other hand, says he's
sorry to see IKE go.

"It was a nice concept while it lasted.
[But] it was their first venture in the interac-
tive kiosk worl " he said. "It just didn't work

Art Boni's wire-rirnrned glasses whenever he speaks of
the proﬁts Pitt will see in coming years as a result of
inventions from University researchers hitting the market
place.

Ideas of how to turn invention into proﬁt are con-
stantly on Boni's mind as he is the head of the Technology
Transfer department at Pitt.

The role of the Technology Transfer division is sim-
ple: move inventions from the research laboratory into the
marketplace by helping researchers license and patent

their creations and ﬁnd either a new market for the prod-

uct or a current, appropriate market.

Last year, Pitt earned over a million dollars just in
licensing and patent fees.

"Universities do not run corporations," Boni said.
"We formulate the formation of companies; we see how
we can diffuse technology into the market place."

Federal legislation passed in the early 1980s helps
universities see dollar signs. Prior to the 1980s, universi-

ties were not able to patent inventions cre-
ated with federal research money.
Approximately 70 percent of the
inventions coming out of Pitt research
labs are in the biomedical ﬁeld. The
remaining 30 percent comes from other
areas in medicine and the information sci-

' CIICCS. -

In 1996, the University generated
$1.2 million in revenue just from licenses
and patents. Boni suspects that ﬁgure will
at least double in coming
years. He also predicts
the creation of at least a
1,000 jobs in the
Pittsburgh area in the near
future. Forecasts such as
these cause city adminis-
trators to look toward the
future with great expecta-
tions.

"The assets are deﬁ-
nitely there," said Steve

nomic development for
the city. "Great research
is being generated and we
need to harness this tech-
nology now. We don't
have a handle on the
magnitude of the effec-
tiveness of technology
transfers, but we should
know in another 18
months."

Getting technology
into the market place
involves securing patents
and licenses for products
and then securing capital for businesses to
manufacture the creations.

Boni cautioned that there is a lag in

time between when a product is licensed

and patented to when commercial proﬁts
are seen. The interim between research
and production can often create complica-
tions between entrepreneurs and
researchers. This is where Boni's talents in
conflict resolution comes in.

"I have seen technology transfers fail
at universities, because both interests
couldn't be adequately accommodated.
The essence of my work is accommoda-
tion, seeing that the interests of the two
sides are met. But all that matters at the
end of the day is that money is made,"
Boni said.

‘ According to Dr. Thomas Detre,
senior vice chancellor for the health sci-
ences, another reason for bad relations
between business and research arose from
the lengthy process it took to get approval
for a product. Detre was appointed by for-
mer Chancellor Dennis O'Connor in the
early 1990s to head a committee that re-
evaluated the process of granting
University support to products and secur-
ing patents for them.

"There was a collective effort by both
the University and business people to
make changes in this procedure. Now the
guidelines are fairly clear and people will

know in a matter of weeks whether or not
there is support for their invention, not
months," Detre said.

According to Marshall Bond of the
Pittsburgh High Technology Council,
technology transfers at Pitt have improved
in recent years. In his estimation, they've
become more effective and he has even
seen some success with the program.

Boni and his counterparts at Carnegie
Mellon University and Allegheny College
believe that Pittsburgh
can become the next San
Diego, Silicon Valley or
Boston. He suggests
learning from their exam-
ples and then showing
that it can be done here in
Pittsburgh.

With other universities
working toward similar
goals, there might be the
potential for a friendly
rivalry. Not so, according
to Boni. 2

"There really isn't com-
petition as their is cooper-
ation. We complement
each other's skills," he
said. "Every university
has a different reason for
‘ being involved with tech-
nology transfers, for Pitt
the reason is to generate
additional revenue for
research. But revenues
will not return just to Pitt;
proceeds will go to the
University as well as the
faculty member and his research team."

Currently, Pitt is involved in forming
two major corporations. The first, IFI
Biologies is a joint partnership between
Pitt and an Italian company. The
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
and Instituo Farmacoperapico Italiano
based in Rome are working toward treat-
ments and vaccinations for lung and colon
cancers. Rheumatix, Inc., the second
company, and another joint creation of
UPMC Health Systems aims to ﬁnd cures
for rheumatoid arthritis.

"This is a fertile time right now. There
is a large research base in this city. I feel
like a child in a candy store, because there
is much going on and that can be done.
Let's establish one, two, or even three suc-
cessful companies that will spawn oth-
ers," Boni said.

To implement these companies takes
a team comprised of University adminis-
trators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and
public ofﬁcials and, Boni said, involves
"partnerships where both sides can win
and managing expectations."

The end result are products that will
beneﬁt the public in coming years.

"As a city, we're used to providing
public service and as a university [Pitt] is
used to used to providing an education,"
said Leeper. "The task now becomes to
combine our efforts."

 lSRAEL  

Rubinstein seemed optimistic about
these talks.

“We have partial peace with
Palestine. We have a series of
agreements leading toward peace,”
said Rubinstein.

When asked about the terrorism
that continues between the two
countries, Rubinstein discussed the
negative effects of terrorism on
peace talks.

“Last week in lWashington,
negotiations with Palestinians were
positive. We are continuing to work
with them, but terrorist problems
cause strain, and to come back
takes time,” he said.

Rubinstein also discussed the
legislation the two countries have
formed to counter terroristic acts.

“We have an agreement with the
Palestinians that the terrorist should
be transported to the country in

FROM PAGE 1

which they committed the crime to
be tried to ensure they don’t have a
mock trial.” '

Rubinstein made it clear to the
audience that the peace process is
going to take time, but he stated
that he looked at the situation as a
glass half-full. He related a story
that confirmed his faith in the abil-
ity of conﬂicting countries to make
peace. That story involved the
arrival of the president of Egypt at
an Israeli airport 20 years earlier.

“He took a very courageous step
toward peace when he arrived in
Israel. It was the most moving
moment of my life.”

Rubinstein concluded his
speech by making a comment on the
future of the peace process.

“We want to foster the idea that
we should extend a hand of friend-
ship to our neighbors,” he said.

Trying to lower cholesterol

Across the Nation

ORLANDO, Fla. —— Lowering your
cholesterol level to prevent a heart
attack might also dull your mental
edge. In a study presented to the
American Heart Association,
researchers found that cholesterol-
lowering drugs may slightly reduce
dexterity and attention.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — British au
pair Louise Woodward has been
ordered freed from jail. A judge in
Cambridge, Mass., said it's time to
bring a "compassionate conclusion"
to the trial of the 19-year-old, con-
victed in the death of an 8-month-
old boy.

In the hours after he reduced her
murder conviction to manslaughter,
Judge Hiller Zobel imposed a new
sentence that amounted to time
already served: 279 days.

It prompted a celebration and
the popping of champagne corks in
Elton, England, where Woodward's
friends and supporters had been
watching anxiously.

Prosecutors this afternoon had
asked again that she be sentenced to
a long prison term. They said she
had shown no remorse for the baby's
death, and that she should be sen-
tenced to 15 to 20 years.

ORLANDO, Fla. —— The baby who
was found in a toilet at Walt Disney
World is doing well at an Orlando,
Fla., hospital. A hospital spokesman

says the girl, who nurses call‘

"Princess Jasmine," is eating well

and "progressing satisfactorily."

She was apparently just minutes
old when found Saturday night in a
restroom at the Magic Kingdom.

An official with the Florida
Department of Children and
Families said the baby will be
released to the agency when she is
discharged from the hospital in two
or three days.

The child may then be adopted,
or may spend some time in a foster
home.

Pitt student gets free work  
from world's top hair stylists

Joy Drzewiecki
Staff Wrlter

Arriving to the scrambling buzz of hair
stylists, makeup artists and "photographers
of ARTec hair design, Pitt student Christina
Kefalos isn't given much time to worry
about the future of her locks.

After a few moments of having her
body and face scrutinized by the fashion
artists, she is quickly whisked away to have

her hair dyed and chopped, and to get her __

face caked in makeup.

An hour and a half later, she has been
transformed into an ARTec hair model,
with her hair dyed a deep red and cut into a
high bob.

Her new look is an aim toimitate a
Calvin Klein model. ‘

"I'm pretty happy with these results,"
said Kefalos, in ARTec's slinky white tank
top and long black skirt. ‘Twas so thankful
they didn't cut all my hair off. You never
know with these things."

As a hair model for the past two years,
Kefalos, a sophomore, is accustomed to
sacriﬁcing her mane to the experimenting
hands of renowned hair stylists.

This past weekend, stylist Jamie
Mazzei, who has done special design work
for the "Rikki Lake" show, out and styled
Kefalos' hair for the ARTec show at

Metropol, a club located in the Strip
District.
For Kefalos, having top ‘stylists like

Mazzei work on her hair is compensation‘

enough for all the rough dye jobs and crazy
hair cuts, since she does not receive a salary
for participating in the shows.

"It's enough that top stylists think that I

can do the job and that I look good enough
for it. That makes me feel important," said
Kefalos. «
Kefalos began her side career as a hair
model two years ago when the salon,
Clipps, in Reagent Square, had her partake
in a photo shoot.

The success of these photos, and her
willingness to commit her hair to the under-
takings of stylists‘ ﬁngers, have placed her
in hair shows throughout the country and,
beginning in the Spring, to_Europe.

Seven months ago, her job landed her
an all—expenses paid trip to New York City,
where top stylists gathered from all over the
world.

"It was crazy," said Kefalos. "Most of
the stylists couldn't speak English and, we
had no idea what they were going to do to
us. "Some Swedish stylists put a black dye
in my hair that left a black ring around my
head," she added "My girlfriend went with
light blond hair, and when she left, it was

Almost anyone can volunteer his or her
locks to experimenting stylists, but, occa-
sionally, there are certain criteria the models
must meet, such as certain body measure-
ments and a willingness to change their hair
style.

female models should

Cheryl Sciarro, region-

"It's easy for me

While she's trying to let her hair grow at
the present time, Kefalos can't seem to keep
the scissors or the dye away from her mane.

Kefalos hopes to continue her hair craze
after college and at times wonders if she isn't
wasting precious time at Pitt.

Kefalos, who has chosen an interdisciplinary
study centered ' around the fashion world.

The events of the past seven
years should tell the Clinton
Administration that Saddam
Hussein will not react nicely
when things aren’t going his way,
especially when the United States
is involved.

Hussein has spent the past
few years building a plethora of
biological weapons, including
ballistic missiles, nerve gas
weapons and germ weapons.
Despite the U.N. inspections dur-
ing those years, the oﬂicials con-
ducting the inspections were not
aware of those biological

‘weapons until September, when

they happened to come across
some people with big suitcases
jumping out of the back door of a

. food testing laboratory.

Since then, Iraqi officials
have been less than cooperative
during U.N. inspections.

They claim that it is their sov-
ereign right to protect the security
of their government.

My theory is that they just
hate the United States and want to
make sure that the U.S. does not
assume more power than other
members of the U.N. The Iraqis’
most recent actions are not meant
to target the U.N. as a whole, and
if you look at the steps Iraq has
taken to exclude the United States
from U.N. actions in Iraq, it is
apparent that they simply do not
want any U.S. inﬂuence in their
country or in the U.N.

They declared that they
would shoot down any U.S.-oper-
ated surveillance planes that ﬂy
over Iraq and demanded that
American U-2 reconnaissance

planes be replaced by ones “from
any other neutral side.” They will
not allow U.N.' teams to inspect
weapons sites because there are
Americans among the teams. In
addition, they are demanding that
representation in the U.N.
Security Council be balanced.

They want to reduce the
American sphere of inﬂuence,
and if the U.S. decides on a mili-
tary strike, Iraq will be ready to
strike back.

There is a strong nationalist
movement growing in Iraq that is
manifest in their anger toward the
U.S. 'I‘hey’ve gathered under a
common theme and message:
down with America. _

Nationalism in the Middle

East, Latin America and other
third world countries has been one
of the biggest problems the
Unitedstateshashadtodealwith
since the 1920s. Their hatred
manifests within governments
and militaries, and among citi-
zens. The results of nationalism
and anti-U.S. protests are the
movements of charismatic leaders
like Fidel Castro and Ho Chi
Minh, whose strategies were like
a double-edged sword: to gain
public support in their own coun-
tries and undermine public sup-
port in the United States.

Obviously, the charismatic
leader of Iraq is Saddam Hussein,
and his supporters are nationalists.
But the nationalist movement is
not limited to citizens of Iraq; it is
a nationalist movement of the
Arab world.

Unfortunately for the U.S.,
the other Arab states — Jordan,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya,
Morocco and Syria — are not
willing to join the U.S. in the

THE PITT NEWS

struggle with Hussein.
Technically, there are U.S. allies
in the Arab world, but that fact
does not necessarily guarantee
their support if a military strike
were initiated by the U.S. because
the Arab states literally witnessed
the deterioration of Iraq following
the U.N. sanctions seven years
ago. The fear is that the deteriora-
tion in Iraq may spread to other
Arab states, regardless of U.N.
sanctions. They have to decide
whom to side with because it is
possible that they will face sanc-
tions and isolation from the U.N.

if they decide to remain neutral. It ’

is also possible that they will face
a military strike from Iraq iftliey
decide not to side with Hussein.

The members of the U.N.
want to avoid a military con-
frontation, and two of them have
already declared that they support
diplomacy. If the U.S. decides on
a military strike, will it be the
obligation of the U.N. to support
it? If not all members of the UN.
support the decisions of the U.S.,
there will be a split within the
U.N.

Instability leads to war.

Saddam Hussein is not will-
ing to adhere to any agreement
that would not be advantageous to
Iraq. He will not allow the U.S to
gain any more inﬂuence among
world powers. The U.S. must
maintain favorable relations with-

in the U.N. and base policy deci- I ‘

sions on knowing what is best for
keeping peace, not on what is best
for the U.S.

The United States needs drastic
welfare reform. The welfare system
started out as a good idea, but now it
is full of problems — problems that
might only be solved by abolishing
the system altogether and coming up
with different ways to help people in
need.

Right now I am working over 30
hours each week, struggling to pay for
college myself. I get almost no finan-
cial aid from the government, even
though my parents _are divorced, and
my mom who raised me doesn’t have
extra money to pay for college. Now
picture another woman who doesn’t
work, yet has all her expenses paid
for: from food to rent, and even her
college education. She also doesn’t
have to pay taxes. The main differ-
ence between me and this other
woman is that she is o‘n welfare and I
am not. It isn’t fair that I work hard
for my money and pay taxes so that
other people don’t have to work at all.

Unfortunately, the problems with
the welfare system are not going to be
easy to solve by any means, especial-
ly with a Democrat for president.

The welfare system breeds lazi-
ness. Welfare was originally designed
to be a short-terrn thing. People were

originally supposed to stay on it long
enough ‘to get their lives back in
order, which seemed like a great idea
at the time. But great ideas don’t
always turn out as planned, and can
cause many problems. ..
Many people on welfare soon dis-
covered that it was much easier to
stay on welfare and not have to work
than it was to go out and get jobs and
have to work for their money. Most

people like to be lazy, and the welfare ~

system doesn’t help matters. Some
people go on welfare and never get
off because they think, “Why should
I?” There are now third-generation
welfare families who will continue to
follow the same path unless some-
thing is done about it.

There is no reason why an able-
bodied person should be allowed to
get away with not working. The
American dream was based on princi-
ples such as hard work and determina-

tion. People on welfare should be

made to be productive members of
society like the rest of us. »

For example, Gov. Thompson of
Wisconsin has reduced the state’s
welfare cases by 58 percent in the last
decade, and this is seen by many as an
example for other states to follow.
The reason he was so successful is
because people -on welfare in
Wisconsin were told they had to go

out and get a job or they would lose
their welfare benefits. They were
assisted in finding jobs, and a very
interesting thing happened: The wel-
fare recipients who ini-
tially were very angry

If it can work in
Wisconsin, it can work in the rest of
the United States. Last year, Congress
passed the welfare reform act. Under
this act, states are required to put half
of their welfare recipients to work, or
at least in job-training positions, by
the year 2002. This was a great victo-
ry for those in favor of welfare
reform, but there is still a long way to
go before the problems with the wel-

-fare system are solved completely.

Now, just because many people
want to see the welfare system abol-
ished doesn’t mean that people don’t
want to help out, even though those in
favor of welfare seem to think that
way. There are better ways to help

 

 vandalizing   I
staute didn '1‘
help anyone

Whoever vandalized the Christopher
Columbus statue needs to read some books
and lay off the Rage Against the Machine
albums for a bit. Vandalism and violence
are not the way to change something that
you see as wrong in your society.

Many Italian Americans in this city
look to that statue as a symbol, not of slav-
ery or evil, but of their freedom and as a
tiibute to the many years of hard work that
their families have put into this country.
The vandalism of the Columbus statue
near Phipps [Conservatory] was a slap in
the face to these people.

Throwing paint on that statue didn’t
magically make the “white devil” disap-
pear. All this did was cost the city $20,000.
Pittsburgh doesn’t have that kind of money

to be throwing around. That money could
have gone to something important and use-
ful.

I’m not at all advocating slavery,
racism or taking land by force. It is very
unfortunate what happened in the “new
world” after Columbus arrived, but it is not
just a “white” thing. Didn’t the Spanish
pay for the voyages? How many of you
consider Spanish people white? Many peo-
ple don’t consider Italians white. I once
heard a German person say, “An Italian is
just black turned inside out.” White people
are not evil; all people are evil!

Slavery, torture, exploitation, etc., are
not exclusive to whites or to Europe. All
these “evils” were happening on other con-
tinents as well, long before Europeans ever
set foot on them. Let’s stop letting MI‘V
tell young adults in this country what to
think. Those “freedom ﬁghters” (sarcasm!)
who damaged the statue didn’t help their
cause; all they did was cost the city money
and olfend a few good, honest, hard-work-

ours who themselves have had to ﬁght

 

against hate and to some extent are still
battling stereotypes today.

We were very disturbed to read the

that your columnist, Alison Novicki, wit-

have zero tolerance of any behavior or

solution would be to provide free or
low—cost child care to single mothers
so they can work. This would give
women who don’t work because of
child—care costs the means to go out
and earn their own living. Donating
more money to food banks would also

help feed those who don’t earn‘

enough to pay for food.

There are many solutions to the

Judgment Day.

In the movies, Judgment Day never
quite happens, staved off" inevitably by
the actions of a cyborg, a kid and a very
militant Linda Hamilton.

In ‘college football, Judgment Day 1

happened last weekend. Unbeatens
played unbeatens, the top—ranked team
won a nail—biter and Joe Patemo got
embarrassed. _

On the whole, not a bad day for Pitt
Panther football fans, although it could
have used a bit more Linda Hamilton.

Still, much like the plot develop-
ment of Terminator 2, Judgment Day
was a bit confusing. So, for the sake of
those who spent all last weekend at
“Vote YES on the Initiative (jobs for
yinz region, n’at)” support groups, let’s
sort it all out:

Um  you first.

Fact is, nobody knows _what in
Beano Cook’s name happened this
weekend. Penn State got beat, North
Carolina got beat, Nebraska won,
Florida State won, Michigan won, and
the focus of the national football
media’s attention quickly focused on 
Tennessee and Ohio State.

Okay....

It appears the best way to settle this
debate is to wait for every top team in
the nation to lose once, then hold a lot-
tery to determine the national champi-
on. Put six or seven teams in a hat, pull
one out and let the other six whine
about it.

Seems stupid, right?

Nope. In fact, it is quite possible
that something along this line will hap-
pen. Only instead of a lottery, the deci-
sion will be made by a bunch of sports-
writers, who we all know are dumb as
rocks. Editors especially.

First, suppose Nebraska runs the
table, giving it a berth in the Big 12
championship game with an undefeated
record.

This happened last season, and
Nebraska, a team with a deserved repu-
tation for choking in big games, choked.
This season, the squad nearly blew its
Judgment Day game versus Missouri,
so expecting a repeat of the 1996 cham-
pionship isn’t too far gone of a theory.

Now, Nebraska has one loss and is
out of the national championship pic-
ture. Sort of.

That leaves us with top—ranked

Coach Harris talks quarterbacks at Monday press conference

Brett Simon

, Staff Wrlter

Quarterbacks Pete Gonzalez and
Donovan McNabb, two of the high-
est—rated quarterbacks in the Big
East, are gearing up this week for a
conference showdown between
Syracuse and Pitt. At his week-
ly press conference Monday, after-
noon, Pitt Head Coach Walt Harris
was asked if he thought it was going
to be an offensive shootout on
Saturday.

“I know Pete isn’t trying to com-
pete with McNabb, He’s just trying
to complete passes,” he said.

Syracuse Head Coach Paul
Pasqualoni, on hand via telephone,
acknowledged the «- quarterback
showdown on Saturday. “They are
two quarterbacks who can really
throw the ball. Both can make big
plays. Both quarterbacks will proba-
bly drive the defenses crazy,”
Pasqualoni said. ‘

But Harris continued by praising
Gonzalez’s play and progress this
season not only on an individual

basis, but on his play within the sys- .

tem.

“Pete’s a heck of a football play-
er. He has learned that he doesn’t
have to make a play himself, the sys-

tern can create plays as well,” Harris
said.

‘Harris cites faith in the system
as an element to Gonzalez’s success
this season and compares it to

Syracuse’s past successes. “They’ve

tasted success. It’s a whole lot easi-
er for the Syracuse players to
believe the coach’s system works.
This is a game with big physical
men in combat krjocking each other
around. Pete has really matured,”
Harris said.

Harris also cited that he had
never coached anyone with a better
touchdown-to-interception ratio
than Gonzalez. His quarterback has
thrown 19 touchdowns and only four
interceptions in eight games.

Coach Harris expressed his.
anticipation of the upcoming game
against Syracuse. “Our players are
anxious to get practicing for the
Syracuse game. We are looking for-
ward to giving them a battle. It’s

Volleyball drops two Big East road match

Staff Wrlter

Dropping two conference
matches late in the season is
usually a recipe for disaster in
any sport.

That isn’t the case for the
Lady Panthers volleyball team,
despite its dropping a pair of
Big East road matches this
weekend.

“Our conference chances
really aren’t hurt at all,” Head
Coach Cindy Alvear said.
“Everyone in the conference
who shouldn’t have lost did.
Syracuse lost to West Virginia
the day after they beat us, and
then Connecticut went out and
lost to Providence, so we’re
still right there.”

Pittsburgh faced Syracuse
Friday afternoon and got off to
a fast start, knocking off the

Orangemen in the first two
games 15-10 and 18-16. The
Lady Panthers’ luck ended
there as Syracuse, who raised
its record to 23-9, battled back
to take the next three games,
and the match, 15-13, 15-7 and
15-13. A

“That loss was devastat-
ing, but we tend to focus on
and remember what we do
well, so it helps us down the
line,” Alvear said. “The team
stayed upbeat —— there is no
point in beating yourselves up
about it; there is no chance to
play well the next match if you
do that.”

Pittsburgh got double dou-
bles from junior Jessica Van
Der Mallie (15 kills and 15
digs), and from freshman
standout Marcia Thiesen (15

Leg one of the Panther hockey
team’s World Tour 1997 road trip started
this past weekend in Annapolis, MD.
The Panthers travelled almost 300 miles
to take on the Naval Academy, then
logged an extra 75 miles on their way
back, passing Pittsburgh to take on
Slippery Rock in Meadville. Sunday
afternoon, the Panthers returned to
Allegheny County to play the Steel City
Stars in Warrendale.

On the road trip, the Panthers logged
almost 900 miles in travel, seven goals
for, 12 goals against and over 100 min-
utes in penalties.

The Panthers are toughening up and
improving, in a round-about sort of way.
On the defensive side, the Panthers rid
themselves of mismatched scores, but
the team couldn’t help themselves in the
“W” column, dropping all three contests.

“We looked a lot better, and we’re
starting to come together as a team,” said
forward Dan Lenza, who tallied one goal
and two assists this weekend. “We’ve
got a lot of work ahead of us, but we’ve
got a lot of talent and a lot of improve-
ment so far.”

The tour began in Armapolis, where
the Panthers dropped a 4-1 contest to the
Naval Academy Midshipmen. After tak-
ing the first period’s 1-1 tie into the
dressing room, goalie Patrick Kenny let
a weak shot go by in the second period
and the Midshipmen capitalized, scoring
an insurance goal in the third period and
adding an empty-net tally to solidify the
win.

Defenseman Dave Konn scored the
only goal for the Panthers, assisted by
Dan Lenza and Tony Herrnankevich.

Problems surrounded Pitt during its
afternoon at the Naval Academy. After
the second period, the rink administra-
tion at Dahlgren Hall could not resurface
the ice, and after the game, the Panthers
had to trek over to the Academy’s nata-
torium because the 75 year—old skating
facility was not equipped with adequate
dressing rooms or showers. Both were
apparent signs that it was time for the
Panthers to leave Annapolis and move
on to Slippery Rock.

Against Slippery Rock on Saturday,
Pitt tightened things up and, despite the
erratic performance of goaltender Dave
Ciarletta, cut down on the lopsided ﬁnal
scores and concentrated on playing
hockey.

However, fatigue from travelling six
hours from Maryland took over early, as
Slippery Rock took advantage of the
Panthers’ poor play in the first 10 min-
utes of the game and jumped out to a
three-goal lead, until Pitt’s Dan Teskey

notched his first goal of the season at
11:02.

Responding to Ciar1etta’s poor per-
formance, Head Coach Jim Brown
yanked the sophomore goalie after the
first period and put in Kenny, who was
coming off the 4-1 loss to Navy. Kenny
yielded three goals in the second period
to Slippery Rock, and Pitt didn’t respond
until Lenza’s tally late in the game,
assisted by Adam Frieze and Kris
Getzik, ﬁnished the contest at 6-2.

“It wasn’t a tough goal,” Lenza
explained of his tally. “I picked up the
rebound and just put it in past the goalie,
who wasn’t there in time.”

Sunday marked Pitt’s debut in the
Theater of the Absurd, T when the
Panthers travelled south to Warrendale
and faced off against the Steel City Stars.

In the absence of Brown, who
missed the Panther outing to coach
another team for the second time in three
games, Assistant Coach Wade
Chouinard took the coaching reins.
Third-string goalie Ian Lebwohl got the
nod in the nets against the Stars, despite
a disappointing showing against IUP on
Oct. 19. While he gave up three goals in
just under 50 minutes of play, Lebwohl
displayed much more conﬁdence in
goal, stopping 21 of 24 shots, but credit-
ed his teammates with a brilliant perfor-
mance.

“It was one of the best games I
played,” Lebwohl commented. “But
everyone stepped up, moving around
and covering rebounds. ‘A lot of the
younger players got ice time as well, and
they just played their hearts out.”

However, Lebwohl’s improved per-
formance was overshadowed by incon-
sistencies galore. The Stars only had two
hours of ice time reserved at the
Bladerunners H rink — their Warrendale
home —— while a collegiate game usual-
ly lasts about three. Three Pitt players
were ejected from the game, and an
injury to Ryan Moore, a result of a cross-
check to the head, stacked the cards
against the Panthers who were already
behind the Stars 4-3 when the game was
ﬁnally called in the middle of the third
period.

The abbreviated game didn’t count
towards the Panthers’ record; most team
members didn’t even chalk that game up
as a worthwhile experience.

“It was silly,” Lenza said. “The third
period didn’t go well at all. The refs
were handing out penalties left and right,
and the game just got out of hand.”

After this past weekend, the
Panthers’ record has fallen to 1-5. The
team’ has this weekend off, then returns
to the ice at 5:00 p.m. on Nov. 22, when
it takes on the Duquesne Dukes at

"Airport Arena in Coraopolis.

Pitt’s Carlson, Jafarian ousted  

early in ITA Rolex tournament

Robert J. Kidwell
Staff Writer

To compete against the best is to
challenge yourself to escalate your game
to a level it has never known.

To compete against the best is to
pull together all the hours of training,
and countless pieces of advice given to
you by coaches and friends, and produce
an effort you have aspired‘ to your entire
life.

To compete against the best, in
terms of the Lady Panther tennis team, is
to head to William and Mary University
for the ITA Rolex tournament and go to
war with the top players from 48 schools
from across the country.

The Rolex tournament took place
Nov. 1-4, at the McCormick Nagleson
Indoor Complex, with two Pitt players,
freshmen Dana J afarian and Lindsay
Carlson, taking part.

Jafarian represented Pitt in singles
play as she took on Karly Porter of
Rutgers University in first round compe-
tition.

Porter took the ﬁrst set convincing-
ly by a score of 6-0, but Jafarian roared
back, battlingto a 4-2 lead in the second
set. Despite her efforts, Jafarian suc-
cumbed to the veteran from Rutgers by
a score of 6-0, 6-4.

Pitt Coach George Dieffenbach
desc1ibedAJafarian’s efforts by saying
that the first year player “fought hard.
Porter had a lot of experience and was
more consistent. This shows Dana the
level she has to reach.” _

This was Jafarian’s first collegiate
competition as the No. 1 player, after she
took the top spot away from fellow
freshman Carlson last month in a chal-
lenge match. 3

Jafarian and Carlson both took to
the court as Pitt’s representatives in the
doubles tournament, taking on a battle-
ready team from Manhattan University
in the first T round. The tandem fell
behind early in the first set, 3-0, but
overcame the big match jitters and post-
ed a convincing 8-4 victory.

“[Jafarian and Carlson] came out a

' little tight, but they came back. It was
tough, aggressive tennis which featured _ .

some good rallies,” said Dieffenbach.

In the second round, Jafarian and
Carlson took on the team from Virginia
Commonwealth, losing by a ﬁnal score
of 8-0.

Dieffenbach commented on the
team’s performance, saying “This is the
best tournament in the country, and we
got to the round of 32 [teams]. That is an
accomplishment. It was good to get a

Florida State —— a team currently sur- .

prising a nation that expected intrastate
rival Florida to top the polls. FSU is 9-
0 and rolling, but could face an
alliance-bowl challenge in Ohio State
—— a squad that has destroyed its recent
opponents after dropping a matchup in
Happy Valley earlier this season.

So OSU wins the bowl game, and
both teams have one loss. And, on the
way to the bowl game, OSU beats
Michigan. '

So Michigan has a loss, but still
goes to the Rose Bowl and wins it over
a bad team from the PAC-10. _

(Keeping up so far? Cliff’s Notes
are available for those who need them.)

While all this is going on, Penn
State, Tennessee, Georgia and Kansas
State all win out.

Eight teams now have one loss.
Toledo probably only has one, but it
doesn’t count.

What do we do? ,

. Well, we do the same as always.
Despite a bowl alliance that’s designed
to put a national championship game
together 4- a definitive matchup
between two undeniable powerhouses
— college football fans ‘are left with the
Associated Press. I I

football.

Teams should. I

If Judgment Day judged anything,
it found the current bowl system not
effective by reason of insanity. The
days of being able to rationalize these
New Year’s parties are over — every-
one this side of Rose Bowl Parade

organizers knows it’s time for playoffs. '

Suppose the situation above pans
out. Now, instead of an eight—team log-
jam at the top of the polls, imagine a
seven—team tournament.

March Madness in December.
Christmas in college-football heaven.
Call it whatever you like, just be darned
sure you put the sponsor’s name ahead
of it and put it on national television.

Ratings would go through the roof.
CBS executives would be able to retire
early on the backs of unpaid athletes
and their millionaire coaches.
Christmas would be a time of office
pools and college—related ornaments.

’ It’s worth careful consideration,
and it’s a logical fallout from Judgment
Day.

Plus, if you still need a parade,
Linda Hamilton could be the grand
marshal.

Kevin Lilley is the sports editor of
The Pitt News and voted “YES” on the
initiative (jobs for our region) along
with ﬁve other people.

PRESS CONFERENCE

« going to be tough; they have size and

speed everywhere.” _

Although he seemed "anxious,
Harris admitted that he was excited
to get on the field after the team’s
third bye—week this season, a factor
which has shut down momentum for
the Panthers. The Panthers are tak-
ing on a 22nd-ranked Syracuse team
that has won six games in a row;
That streak includes a 40-10 drub-
bing of unranked West Virginia.

However, 5 last week the
Orangemen didn’t look impressive
in a 20-13 victory over Boston
College. 5 ”

“-Our players should be confident
after Syracuse didn’t dominate
Boston College,” Harris said of the
team’s morale.

In regard to preparation for this
weekend’s crucial game, Coach
Harris was in good spirits yesterday.
“We’ve studied both Boston College
and Syracuse, and hopefully we’re a
better team than we were against
Boston College.”

Pasqualoni said that his players
are healthier now than they have
been all season, and their confidence
is up. A

“We lost both the North Carolina

State game and the Oklahoma game
on the last play of the game,” said
Pasqualoni. “Our confidence was
down after those games,’ butnow
we’re playing with confidence.”

Pasqualoni’s only concern was‘
about the Panthers’ dynamic duo at
the ‘wide receiver position, Jake
Hoffart and Terry Murphy, whom he
” He also
expressed his high regard for corner-
back Hank Poteat.

The conference also revealed a
rumor that Syracuse might be mov-
ing to the Big 12 Conference in the
near future.

“I haven’t sat down and talked
with anyone yet,” the Syracuse head
coach said. “That decision will be
made at the highest level.” \

Pasqualoni’s response, while not
revealing, might unfold into an inter-
esting turn of events in the upcoming
months. An Orangemen defection to
the Big 12 would deal a serious blow
to the already down Big East
Conference.

“I think the Big East is a good
situation for Pitt right now. The
teams in the conference need to stick
together and get through the tough
times,” Harris said. -

kills and 13 digs).

The Lady Panthers got double—digit
kills from Melissa Alpers (14) and Peggy
Meinhart (13), and a team-high 44 assists
from Tara Haefner. ,

Syracuse was led by Rachel
Watson’s 14 kills and a match-high 25
digs. Desiree Hobbs and Dana Fiume
each notched 14 kills, while Carrie Urton
added a match-high 56 assists.

Sunday, Pittsburgh traveled to South '

Bend to face perennial conference power
Notre Dame. Playing in front of the
biggest conference crowd of the season
(862 in attendance), Alvear and company
dropped the first two games 15-2 and 15-
3 before grabbing a 16- 14 win in the third
game to pull within one. But Pittsburgh
lost the final game 15-5 to fall to 13-11
overall and -5-4 in the Big East. Notre
Dame raised its record to 19-6 with the
win, including a league-leading 9-0 Big
East record. '

“We got blitzed in the ﬁrst game, and
they didn’t even have all their starters in,”
Alvear said. “All their seniors started
because it was senior night, but by the
middle of the second game their coach
put the starters back in because it was so
nip and tuc .” 5

The Lady Panthers won the third
game 16-14 with all four of the squad’s

freshman on the ﬂoor at the same time.
This marked the first time in a long time
that Alvear can remember playing such a
lineup.

Freshman Thiesen was the lone

Pittsburgh player with double ﬁgures in 1

kills, with 14. Van Der Mallie chipped in
with nine kills and 12 digs in the loss,
while Haeﬁrer added 10 digs and a team-
high 27 assists.

The Fighting Irish got 21 kills and
nine digs from Jaimie Lee, 14 kills and
20 digs from Angie Harris, and 11 kills
and ﬁve digs from Christine Girton.
Denise Boylon contributed to the four-
game win with a match-high 35 assists.

Pittsburgh travels to Connecticut and
St. John’s this weekend for its ﬁnal con-
ference tests before the Big East charnpi—
onships Nov. 22 and 23 at Seton Hall.
Alvear is upbeat about Pittsburgh’s
chances.

“Our inexperience level is shrinking
all the time. It’s just a matter of how long
we can sustain [our development],”
Alvear said. “The improvement is unbe-
lievable, and we seem to be peaking at
just the right moment. If we can beat
UConn and St. John’s this weekend, we
can very well go into the conference tour-
nament as the third seed, and we can’t
ask for anything better than that.”
