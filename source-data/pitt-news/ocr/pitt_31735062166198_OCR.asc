‘Visiting Union Board President

Tells Congress of Student Role

By MILI.ARD_ AMDU1:

Cliﬁord Sheats, president‘ of the student union board,
Wayne University, spoke to Student Congress on the estab-
lishment of an effective Student Union program at Pitt.

Sheats aserted that the Union-should “be a unifying force

2

contributing much to the dynamic ‘college community.

Many problems are likely to arise in the formation of a

working governing body for, the¢

Union according to the adminis-
trator. The relationships of stu-
dent body,~ student government,
faculty, and alumni to the Stu-
dent Union governing body are
subject to dispute. Another con-
sideration often is whether the
Union board will serve as a body
for the planning, of social func-
tions only or as a legislative stu-
dent government agency.* ‘

The student union expert
further stated that it is ideal for
students to be involved from the
very beginning in planning and
implementation of the student
union program. Since the stu-
dents must actively support the
program to insure its success,
it follows that they deserve an
important role in formulating
the program.

Congress has established a com-
mittee on Hungarian scholarships
chaired by Tom Jenkins, Col. ’57,
vice president of Congress. Vari-
ous representatives‘ of students,
faculty, and administration com-
pose the membership of the com-
mittee.

Stanley Goldberg, Col. ’59, as-
semblies committee chairman,
announced to SC the possibility
of an organized send-off for the
team before their departure for
Miami. It was moved and pass-

'~.

 

ed by the government body that
homecoming queen, Sally John-
son, Col. ’59, be the reigning
queen of the school at the Gator
Bowl.

A judicial committee was elect-
ed by Congress from ‘within the
group. Chairman of the judicial
body‘ is Tom Jenkins. Four mem-
bers of the committee were
[selected from snominees, Larry
'.Miller, Col. ’57, Burt O’l\/Ialley,
Col. ’59, Virginia van Goetham,

Crucible Presents Trophy

JOYCE KOPLOS

The Crucible Steel Company of S

America and the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, in conjunction with the

Foreign Policy Association of
Pittsburgh, jointly sponsor the
Cross - Examination Tournament.

Debating teams are rated and al-
though no decisions are given, the
rotating Crucible Steel Trophy is
presented to the team with the
highest total ratings. Gegeral ef-
fectiveness of the individual de-
bating teams determines the rat-
ing. Critique judges scale decis-
ions on a one (poor) to seven
(excellent) basis.

The Pitt Varsity Debating
Team tied for ﬁrst place in last
year’s Cross-Exam Tourneywith
Case Institute of Technology and
Notre Dame. But "on a point for

medals are given to the ﬁve high-
est-ranking speakers. Pitt debat-
ers may receive medals, but the

Tutoring Now Open To,W'omen  

Students Conduct

Informal Classes

In Frosh Sub ects

Free Tutoring Service being
given by Phi Eta Sigma,
Freshmen Honorary Frater-
nity, -has been successfully
helping eight per cent of un-
dergraduate men and women

having difﬁculty with freshman
courses.

Thirty members of Phi Eta Sig-
ma. have been conducting thirty
classes a week in such courses as
Math. 21, ch emistry, biology,
English, history, physics, account-
ing, French, Spanish, and German.

Since the founding of the
Free Tutoring Service in 1937.
Phi Eta Sigma has helped only
freshman men. This year, as a
new part of the program, all
undergraduate women taking
‘freshman courses were asked to
sign up.

An example of the effectiveness
of this tutoring service is the
Math. 21 class taught by Bob
Muzik, Engr. ’58, Chairman of
the Tutoring Service. In an in-
formal atmosphere, the eight men
students brought up pertinent
work. There was none of the ten-
sion of a formal classroom, yet
considerable work was covered.

The student tutor gave indi-
vidual aid, as the class asked
questions on items that particu-
larly confused them. In this
class, the students responded fa-
vorably to the student service.

When asked, “Is this class help-.
ing you?” James Thomas, ME ’60,
said, “This class is deﬁnitely help-

ing me. Mostly because it gives me .

personal and individual help.”

French Group Sets
ScholarshipBenefit

During the past two years the
French Room Committeehas col-
lected enough funds to constitute
it’s first scholarship. This made it
possible to send to France last
summer a carefully selected young
American Student from the Jun-
ior Class in the.College for study
at the Ecole du Louvre. Susanna
Biddle, Col. ’57, was the recipient
of last year’s award.

This evening, in Stephen Foster
Memorial Hall, the French Room
Committee will present a concert
of French music given by the
Junior New Friends of Music.
Music will be presented by the
French composer, Rameau, Mes-
siaen, Milhard, Chopin, and Stra-
vinsky. Pitt Students will serve as
ushers. ,

year’s event.

March 11 will mark the begin-
ning of the 1957 program and a
full slate of activities will con-
tinue until March 15. The purpose
of the week, as stated by Larry,
is to “highlight the engineering
profession in general and, speci-
ﬁcally, engineering here at Pitt.”

A number of “intellectual and
informative events will be in-
cluded in the program, and, all
E & M class buildings will be
open to visitors. Each depart-
ment will construct original dis-
plays depicting the operations
involved in its particular branch
of engineering.

Prominent outside speakers will
be invited to deliver talks on some
phase of engineering or industry
with which they are acquainted.
Last year’s, guests included Gen-
eral Matthew B. Ridgeway, di-
rector of Mellon Institute, and Mr.
John L. Young, then a vice-presi-
dent of United States Steel.

 

Week Set

As part of the social side of-
the week, old St. Patrick, the
patron saint of Pitt engineers,
will make his usual surprise ap-
pearance on campus, and all en-
gineers, will sport their tradi-
tional green derbies.

A mixer dance will be held
during the week, and on Friday
evening, March 15, the Shamrock
Ball will bring the full week of
events to a close. At this event, St.
Patricia, queen of Engineer’-3
Week, will be crowned.

While all of the events plan-
ned thus far are tentative ones
subject to the approval of the
Control Planning Committee of _
the cabinet, it is probable that
all of them will be included in
the program.

“Engineer’s week will, I hopg, 

not only serve to strengthen thd‘
social calendar of the engineering
school,” said Larry, “but also
bring closer public attention to
the ﬁeld of engineering and
science.”

. Gourmets Dine Well

As Guests, Waiters

By FITZHUGH SCHENLEY

The entire membership of Gourmets Anonymous, Pitt’s
new secret society devoted to the pleasures of dining well
at leisure, muscled in on the recent dinner given by Omicron

Delta Kappa in honor of Mortar Board. ‘
V In one capacity or another, with administration and
faculty and students all represented, the members were

present either /as guests or waiters.

The dinner, served as a Thanks-
giving buffet, was planned by ODK
members Eugene Reinbold, Mitch-
ell Kowzikowski, a n (1 Thomas
Vrana as a more or less /exact
replica of the original Thanks-
giving dinner served at,Plymouth
in/1621.

"wt/Gourmets Anonymous, having

caught the committee red-handed
doing research in the Fifth Floor
Reference Room and knowing that
their Puritan forbears loved good
food, made suggestions for prop-
erly serving the varieties of ﬁsh,
lobsters, oysters, wild game, maize,

' beans and squash which made up

the menu on Governor Bradford’s
ﬁrst Thanksgiving Day.

As the guests gathered in the
Panther’ Room, the committee

‘ served a New England Beef Broth

on the Rocks (Plymouth, of
 course), with Rye Bread and gar-

‘Tic butter, salted nuts, and smoked
mussels.

At the long buffet table the ar-
ray of food was impressively pre-
sented in a way which would have
surprised the Indians and their
hosts at the feast.

' A twelve-pound whole salmon
on a silver platter, a casserole of
escalloped oysters, hot codﬁsh balls
in a chaﬁng dish, and lobster sal-
ads served in the shell repre-
sented the foods the Puritans took

from the sea and rivers.

A hot venison pie, a ham and a
turkey were surrounded by a cas-
serole of escalloped com, a pot of
Boston beans, and wedges of bak-
ed acorn squash.

The committee in charge of the
dinner had spent many hours de-
bating the relative merits of pos-
sible desserts for a bountiful
Thanksgiving menu. A ﬂaming
plum pudding ﬁnally won out,‘
and after a slight mishap during
which the brandy, sensitive, no
dougt to Eighth Floor custom, re-
fused to burn, the pudding was
served with a suitable hard sauce.

As a ﬁnal ﬂourish, demi—tasses
were served in the “living room,"
although the ODK committee and
Gourmets Anonymous agreed that
it was difﬁcult to visualize Gov-
ernor Bradford, Priscilla Alden,
and Massasoit requesting either
one or two lumps for such a small
spot of coffee.

The University Police Depart-

Lt. Charles Ray, chief of uni-
versity police, cautioned stu-
dents, faculty, and staff in the
Cathedral not to leave purses,
valuable books, and slide rules
unwatched. According to Lt.
Ray, there is a popular miscon-
ception circulating in the Ca-
thedral that since one never

‘ hears of things being stolen, one
need have no fear of valuable s
possessions being taken. This
unfortunately is not true. Books
have been stolen while students
have stepped out into the balls
to smoke.

Lt. Ray also stressed the fact
that “only a few” outsiders get
into the Cathedral. The offenders
are believed to be connected with

the University.

    Pellulpoint   Pleasure  

Free organ recitals may not “soothe the savage beast,”

I but they may certainly calm, please, and inspire, students.

For, as Frederick W. Lotz, University organist, has stated,
“Organ music is a beautiful combination of many things...
of mythology and literature and art . , . that has grown
down through the ages.” ~ I 5

From the sounds of tinkling church bells, through
deep—toned French horns and brassy trumpets, the Heinz
chapel organ echoes at the touch of Mr. Lotz’s skilled ﬁngers.
This “versatility” of effect repays many times those who

‘ give 30 minutes occasionally to attend the recitals,

In addition to presenting recitals daily except Wednes-
day from lg-1:30 p.m., Mr. Lotz accompanies the Heinz
Chapel Choir, and plays for weddings in the Chapel. The
regular organ recitals range through the music of Brahms,

Handel, Bach, and many others. These concerts arerecord— .

ed for broadcast over station WDUQ.

Before 1942, Mr. Lotz played in Gothic Cathedrals of
Europe. Now, in another Gothic structure, he has con-
tinued ior 14 years to give Pitt students keyboard pleasure.

Although not a graduate of any music academy or col-
lege, the Heinz Chapel musician studied under several
private tutors and did seminar work in Paris. In _1919 he
studied under Isadore Phillips and gave recitals incathedrals
throughout northern France. 

As well as accompanying choirs and for weddings, Mr.

Lotz is an accompanist for the stained—glass windows of .

the Heinz Chapel. The effect of both windows and music
is a type of relief from the rush between classes and ac-
tivity meetings. ‘ .

His calming, pleasing, inspiring inﬂuence cannot be
measured. ‘

U. S. Is A Losing T-'0 Russia In . . .

The Technical Race   ,     

By Gordon Clowney

In recent years much has been made of the
fact that the United States has not been develop-
ing scientists and engineers at a fast enough rate-

This shortage of technically trained people is not
only threatening industrial progress at home, but
is also causing the U.S. to gradually fall behind
in the contest with Russia for technical supremacy.

The problem is not that we
have been producing a small
number of engineers and scien-
tists. In fact just the opposite
istrue. In the last 15 years our
scientific force has more than
doubled. However, despite this
rapid increase in the trained

try, and of government and edu-
cation have risenjstill faster.

 

Growth of Research .

Principal reason forlthis increased demand is
due’ to the growth of research since the early
1940’s. Over two-thirds of the research is done
by private industry, mostly to develop ‘new and
better methods of production. Most of the rest is
performed by the government, largely to develop
improved and inevitably more complex scientiﬁc
weapons. ‘

Not all of the science-and engineering graduates ’

willgo into research work. This type of training
is now necessary in many sales and ‘management
pbsitions. In addition, many of the technically train-
ed men and women must remain in educational in-
stitutions as teachers if our quality of technical
education is to remain at a high level.

These needs of business and education only
make the needs of research more pronounced. It
is estimated that if our recent yearly rates of pro-
duction of slightly over 20,000 PHD's in natural
sciences could be doubled the gap would not be

Stiff Competition

   

closed entirely. * »

Both the United States and Russia have about.

a million scientists and engineers. Although the
Soviet Union does not at this time have a pro-
nounced lead in these scientiﬁc areas, it is the
trend in their favor that is alarming. Over the

‘last ﬁve years we have turned out only 142,000

engineers compared to an estimated 216,000 in
Russia. A ‘

The goal of Soviet scientiﬁc manpower policy
includes not only supremacy in arms and war pro-
duction,ibut also leadership of the neutral and un-
committed areas of Asia, Africa, and the Middle
East. ‘

Top Salaries

In Russia, scientists and engineers are pail”

salaries that seem fantastic when compared to
other Soviet incomes. Senior professors, research
scientists, and top engineers are a major segment
of the Russian elite. Their incomes are frequently
six to ten times the average industrial wage.,(In
the ,United States‘ six to ten times the average
industrial wage would be between $25,000 and
$40,000.) Housing“ and other privileges are cor-
respondingly lavish. ' , ‘ L '

The Russians are also very generous in their
aids to education. Tuition is free _to all jéstudents.
Both undergraduates and graduates receiveenough
money for living expenses while they are studying.

Thebiggest allotments go to science and enginee1:'r*

ing students. V
College students are deferred from 'military

service, and engineers and scientists often retain

the deferrment even after graduation. -5 5.,
In the United States, scientiﬁc and engineering

careers have long had a reputation for low salaries

and limited opportunities for advancement. This
has lowered the morale of experienced men and
provided an incentive to dessert engineering and

‘research positions for higher paying jobs in sales‘

and management ﬁelds.

(Editor’s Note: The following
column written by Dr. Robert
Newman, Director 0} Men’s De-
bate Association, explains the
Cross-Examination Tournament
held at Pitt every year.)

By Dr. Robert Newman

Since its inauguration in 1948,
the‘ annual Cross-examination
to rnament . sponsored by the
Pi t Men’s Debating Association
has grown to a position of such
prominence that it now attracts
45 colleges and Universities from
18 American states and two
Canadian provinces. This is a
breadth of participation achiev-
ed by only a half- dozen similar
events throughout the country.

Debate to u r n a m e n "t s, like
basketball tournaments, are de-
signed to provide competition

, among a substantial numberof

entrants in a single meeting. Be-
cause of the great economyof
tournaments, they have largely
replaced the single debates once
held between ‘two schools. Since
nothing as complicated as l a
basketball court is required ~to
stage a debate, a tournament can
accommodate as many teams as
there are classroomsyavailable;
at Pitt this coming weekend, the
45 visiting teams and the 5 Pitt
teams will all debate simultane-
ously. '

Toronto Meets Cal

It works this way: while the
Toronto affirmative is meeting
the Southern California negative
in 121 C1. with the Vermont
coach as judge, the Notre Dame
affirmative is meeting the Wake
Forest negative in 119 C1. with
the Florida coach as judge, etc.,
so that all 50 teams are partici-
pating simultaneously through
ﬁve rounds of debate. At the
conclusion, scores will be added
up, and a winner declared.

Pitt’s tournament is the only
major event in the country using
‘cross-examination style. Other
prominent tournaments, such as
those -held annually at West
Point, Notre Dame, Vermont,

Northwestern, and Miami, use

an orthodox stylelwith each of

four speakers giving a 10-minute
constructive and 5-minute re-
buttal speech. The Pitt style cuts
constructive speeches to 8 min-

utes, and gives each speaker 4
minutes to cross-examine an
gpponent. This style is more

ifficult, but its appropriateness
for future lawyers is unques-
tioned, and it seems to be grow-
ing in popularity. 5

Aside from the general pres-
tige of Pitt debating, there are
three basic reasons for the
growth of the Cross-exam tour-
nament: ‘

1. Efficiency of operation. The
problems of housing, feeding,
and scheduling simultaneous de-
bates for 15 teams or more can
be very complicated indeed.

Pitt’s ability to run a 50-team.

tournament ,,on time is due to
careful planning, hundreds of
hours of work by MDA ‘ofﬁcers,
and the freshmen tournament
staff, and the good fortune of

having 50 rooms in one building. 0

Debate tournaments are some-
times snarled with bad pairings,
delays in starting, inadequate or
conflicting instructions, and long
distances between debate rooms;
at Pitt these things do not hap-
pen.

Pitt Leads Nation

2. Rewards. Pitt leads the na-
tion in industrial sponsorship of
its debating activities. Due to
the support of Crucible Steel
Company of America, the Pitts-
burgh Post Gazette, and C.
Spohn Ford Agency, an impres-
sive group of awards is present-
ed to the Cross-exam winners.
The top-ranking school gets pos-
session for one year of the Cruci-
ble Steel Trophy and-permanent
possession of a smaller trophy;
top - r a n kin g affirmative and
negative teams each get perma-
nent trophies; and specially-cast
MDA keys go to the ﬁve highest-
rated speakers. Though Pitt
teams have placed highest in the

tournament for three consecu- I
tive years, we do not ‘believe in‘

keeping our own trophies, and
have awarded them to the top
visiting schools.

3. Caliber and diversity of
competition. Because , of th e
challenge of cross-examination

style, most schools send their '

best teams, and the better de-
bate schools are attracted‘. Parti-
ally because of this, and the
previous factors mentioned,
schools come from a great dis-
tance to compete. Thisimeans
that the _averag_e school partici-
pating will meet teams tha‘t~’

would not normally meet during
the year. Care ‘is taken to ar-
range the pairings so that
schools do not meet neighbors;
the two Illinois teams in this
year’s tournament, Northwestern
and Illionis State Normal, will
be separated so that theydo not
meet each other; dit-to for the
Vermont, Indiana, Virginia, and
other entries. Only with Penn-
sylvania,' New York, and Ohio
teams is this impossible.

Future tournaments will pro-
bably be reduced in size some-
what. It is difficult to extend full

* hospitality to 45 visiting teams,

and the classroom problem is’
becoming more acute. An opti-
mum slizegof 35 is anticipated.

Next year on the tenth annivers- I

ary of the tournament, an effort
will be made to secure an entry
from every state East of the
Mississippi. I '

Thirty Years Ago
By Local Groups

By MARCIA GETTING

In 1921 Chancellor John‘-G.
Bowman felt that there should
be a bond between the Uni-
versity and the Nationality

‘ groups of the Pittsburgh area,

and that these groups should

have the opportunity to express
their cultural heritage in the Uni-
versity program.

Mrs. Ruth C. Mitchell, director
of Nationality Rooms Program,
then a lecturer on Americanism at
the University, was asked by the
Chancellor to discover how to
form this bond.

Mrs. Mitchell met with many of
the nationality groups and dis-
cussed ways of expressing and

.preserving a bit of essense of their

culture and ways of building un-
derstanding in working relation-
ships. She made a nativity study
of the student body of the Uni-
versity from the years 1926 to
1930 to determine what groups

tation to sponsor a classroom.
There were, however, a few
exceptions: The student body
petitioned, the University to
have a Chinese room, the Syria-
Lebanon group was called upon
to represent the Near East, and
even though there were few
French-born American citizens,
it was felt that France’s contri-
butions to our Western culture

The Nationality Rooms “Com-
mittees established and furnished
their rooms. The French Commit-
tee held a Sete Parlsiennei and a
Gaie Soiree with debutantes.

At Christmas the Swedish Com-
mittee'he1d a smorgasbord. The
Czechoslovakian-Polish Commit-
tee held and sponsored concerts of
their country, such as Theodore
Schutz, tenor of the national opera
in Prague.

Even during the depression,
the people in the Tri-State area

continued to raise money for_

their rooms. They held card
parties, picnics, dances, garden
parties, athletic affairs, ban-
quets, and even chartered boat
trips on the rivers. Individuals,
families, and organizations all
contributed.

Without the constant effort and
loyalty of the local groups it is
doubtful that the rooms would

ever, national and international

encouragement to the Pittsburgh

' group.

Each Nationality Group
worked ‘with the government
and companion committees in
its respective country, especially
in the planning and selection of
the design and architecture of
the room. The Companion
Committee and government
made available not only the
best artist and skilled crafts-
men to work on the room, but
many of them also made con-
tributions in the form of money,
materials, and works of art.

Internationally famous people
took a personal interest in these
rooms; Paderewski, who donated
the original copy of his only
opera, “Manru,” to the Polish
room; and Thomas G. Masarayk,
President-Founder of the Czecho-
slovakian Republic, and Prince
Berpil of Sweden, both of whom
worked with the committee.

The ﬁrst four rooms——the Rus-
sian, Scottish, German, and Swed-
ish room —- were completed with
their dedications on July 8, 1938.

When the Panthers play in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 29,

it will mark the third bowl

The ﬁrst, of course, was on New Year’s Day of this year.
Then during the regular season on Oct. 20 the local gridders

Although the relatively small

two participants can look forward
to exclusive nation-wide cover-

Even more attractive is the fact
that the Sugar Bowl battle be-

the most talk and discussion of the
1956 New Year’s game, and noth-

be asked for.

Some football experts have
gone so. far as to say that the

Cagers Face Towering Titans .

With two losses recorded in their ﬁrst two games on
‘ foreign courts, the Panthers will try to enter the win column
tonight as they host Westminster in their home opener.

Their latest loss came at the hands of Ohio State, 100-67.

Control of the boards
Buckeyes proved to be the down-
fall for the Jungle Cats.

From the early moments of the
game, the Staters used a full-
court press to force the Panthers
into shooting from the outside.

Hennon Stopped
The Jungle Cat shooting attack
was a little stifled as they re-

; peatedly missed set shots from the
' out-side.

The bright spot in the Pan-
ther attack was the driving lay-
ups by Bob "Lazor and Julius
Pegues. Lazor led the scoring
parade for the locals with 22

points f o l l o W e d closely by
. Pegues with 17.
Unlike his previous g a m e

against North Carolina State, Don
Hennon had some trouble getting
familiar with the Buckeye court
but netted twelve points before
the ﬁnal buzzer.

Same Starting Lineup
Coach Bob Timmons will stay
with his starting line-up of John
Riser and Pegues at forwards
while Lazor handles the pivot
slot. Chuck Hursh and Hennon
will start at the guard positions.
This contest will be the 44th
meeting between the Panthers
and their arch-rivals Westmin-
ster. The series has the Jungle
Cats sitting on top of a 22-21
record.
The Towering Titans will re-
semble their nickname this season.

The «starting lineup will average

by the%

6-4 with center Jim Riley of Me-
Keesport the key man.

Riley Holds Record

Riley, in his last season with
the Titans, has tallied 1390
points in three years of varsity
competition which is also a school
record.

The supporting cast to Riley
will be comprised of George
Strehler (6-4) and Dick Jordan
(6-7) at forward while Harold
Davis (6-1) and Dave Rankin
(6-3)" round out the cast at-
guard.

Davis and Strehler will be act-
ing co-captains for the Westmini-
ster quintet.

A new head coach will accom-
pany the Titans to the Field House
in Charles (Buzz) ‘Ridl. Ridl has
taken over during the temporary
absence of Coach Grover Washa-

Gridilers Challenge

Vaunted Hurricanes

By MURRAY CHASS

Miami will be the first stop on the revenge-minded
Panther gridders’ winter tour of the South-. On Saturday
at 2 p.m. national television cameras will focus on the almost
post-season battle between the local eleven and the unde-
feated but once, tied Miami Hurricanes.

The Panthers are revenge—minded in that they were

defeated by the 1955 Hurricanes}

21-7, in a tussle that saw present
stars, quarterback Sam Scarnec-
chia and fullback Don Bosseler,
completely fool the Panther de-
fense.

Of course, in three weeks the
Jungle Cats will be out to prove
that their Sugar Bowl loss to

I7"Georgia Tech on Jan. 1 of this

year was merely a “fluke.” This

they will attempt to do at Jack-

Hurricanes Dangerous
The Blue and Gold has had two
weeks in which to prepare an ef-
fective attack to throw against
their hosts, who put as much em-
phasis on the defensive end of the
game as they do on the scoring
part of it. Two —weeks ago the
Hurricanes limited West Virginia,
whom the Panthers nosed out, 14-
13, to 45 yards rushing.
According to assistant coach
- Steve Petro, the Oaklanders will
need a powerful offense and a
stalwart defense to ruin Miami’s
8-0-1 slate. Petro scouted the
Floridans in their last two
games and came away from
both sounding nothing but praise
for the bowl-eligible Hurricanes.
Among the phrases used was
(“one of the best teams I have ever
'¢seen’;’; and this is indeed praise
.for any squad. Petro also let it be
known that the Miami line is “ex-
éceptionally tough,” and that “the
backs are tremendously fast and
they can get through the smallest
hole.”

Team Ready

Captain Bosseler was the player
who impressed scout Petro the
most. He claims that the Panthers
will have to be on their toes if
they want to keep this hard-
charging fullback from running
wild. ‘

this game except for a few
minor hurts. ‘‘

Both Corny Salvaterra and Bob
Pollock have gone through only
light workouts this week, but
should be in top shape by Satur-
day. The Panthers’ daring signal-
caller has a slightly bruised leg,
and Pollock is being cautious
about his previously injured ankle
and knee.

Walton Seeks Title

Corky Cost, who underwent an
emergency appendectomy prior to
the Penn State tussle, will miss
the southern trip. Starting at
Cost’s left half position will be
either Dick Bowen or Bags Baga-

kicks off. .

Walton, who along with Pollock
has been elected honorary co—cap-
tain of the team, will be out to

he starts his last regular season

rently tied with two other wing-
men for this crown with six TDs,

but they both have completed.

‘I-Ieralded Foe Ineligible F... Bowls

Miami ’s ‘Best ’MeetsPanthers

By AL PELAEZ

Pitt’s Gator Bowl bound
gridders will get a sneak pre-
view of the sunshine state
this Saturday when they jour-
ney down to Miami to tackle
the undefeated——but tied-—
Hurricanes.

The Panthers, conﬁdent and
loose since they received a bowl
bid, will have to play one of their
better games to top the rampag-
ing Hurricanes. Miami followers
think that this is one of the two
top teams the university has pro-
duced in the 30 years it has ﬁeld-
ed a team.'The starting unit is
composed of tested veterans --
but it’s the reserves that have
kept the coaches and fans opti-
mistic. Primarily sophomores, the
reserves are bigger, faster — and
some think. better —- than the
front line players.

Miami is ineligible to p-artici-
pate in a post season game this
season and will be out to show
a homecoming day crowd that
only this technicality has kept
them out of a bowl. The fact
that the Pitt game was chosen
as the Miami homecoming is
more than just coincidental.
Coach Gustafson and Jay Pear-
son, president of the University,

DON BOSSELER
Igey to “drive series”
0 O O

are both Pitt graduates. Gustaf-
son played and coached under
the late Jock Sutherland before
migrating to Miami. In addition
to this, 15 Hurricane players
are from the Pittsburgh district.

Miami, which has always been
a powerful offensive team, credits
much of this season’s unexpected
success to its outstanding de-
fense. The Hurricanes have held
the opposition to only a little over
a 100 yards per game on the
ground and 85 yards a contest
through the air. They have held
nine opponents to 32 points and
have not allowed any team to
score more than once against

   
   

them. Four opponents, including
powerful West Virginia, Texas
Christian and Orange Bowl Bound
Clemson failed to score against
Miami.

Augmenting this rock-ribbed
defensive unit is an offense that
has rolled up 161 points in nine
games and is capable of moving
the ball equally well on the
ground or through the airlanes.
Miami uses the famed Miami
Drive Series -— an offense that
sends the fullback crashing into
the line on every play, forcing
the opposing linemen to converge
upon him. This opens the way for
other backs to run the ends and
for quarterbacks Sam Scarnecchia
and Bonnie Yarbrough to drop
back and pass in comparative
safety.

The key to this type of of-
fense. is a big, rugged fullback—-
and Miami has two of the best
in All—American Don Bosseler
and Paul Hefti, called the best
reserve in the country by his
coach. The only weakness in
this set-up is the absence of .a
real running threat at the half-
back positions.

Saturday could be a _rough
afternoon for the Panthers if
they’re thinking about Tech and
Jacksonville instead of Miami and
the high—ve1ocity Hurricanes.
