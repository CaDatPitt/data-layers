BY MICHAEL CLINTON

The Black Studies Department
(BS) is still without a chairman,
since the resignation of Dr. Fela
Sowande two weeks ago.

Sowande was appointed acting
chairman by Dean Jerome Rosen-
berg of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS), last spring.

The appointment conﬂicted with
a proposal from outgoing chairman
Jack Daniels and a faculty vote of
11-4, naming Curtiss E. Porter as
the new chairman. At the time,
Porter was Director of Program
Development for Black Studies.

Since Sowande’s resignaton, a
search committee has been formed
to appoint a temporary acting
chairman. Rosenberg is assuming
the position until a new appoint-
ment is made.

In an interview with the Pitt
News, Porter stated that “the
whole issue of appointment a new
chairman is one of faculty rights vs.
administration.

“The faculty should have the
right to self-govemment within
their own department, especially
on the issue of choosing a
departmental head,” (Sept. 12,
1973).

Porter also explained a ‘ new
concept of in self-governing among
academic departments throughout
the country, whereby each depart-
ment draws up a constitution and
rules itself.

He pointed out that BS has also
established a constitution and that
in accordance with its tenets, the
faculty should make decisions for
themselves, without the Dean’s
interference.

Porter noted that when BS
presented the idea of a constitution
to Provost Rhoten Smith, the
Provost called it “a step in the right
direction.”

According to Porter. this self-
governing prinicple was in effect
with the selection of Dr. David
Montgomery, as chairman of the
history department. Porter added.
“The faculty voted for Mont-
gomery and presented their deci-
sion to the Dean's office" The
decision was readily approved.

Dean Rosenberg agreed that

“the faculty definitely has rights in
their own affairs,” but added “the
dean has rights too.”

“Every department is differ-
ent,” said Rosenberg, “and what
applies to the history department,
doesn’t necessarily apply to my
decisions concerning the Black
Studies department.”

Porter told the Pitt News that “a
list of perspective candidates for
the position, approved by the BS
faculty and various community
organizations, has been sent to the
Dean's office.” He declined to
name any of those on the list.

He said “The candidates were
selected in accordance with the BS
Constitution.” “Unless the ﬁnal
administrative decision is in
accordance with these faculty
rights, it will be considered that no
real decision has been made.”

Rosenberg said “A search
committee is in operation to find a
new acting chairman.” He
declined to comment however,
when asked how far the committee
has progressed, or whether he
could speculate on who would be
selected.

Ten Cents too much?

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

The House of Representatives
voted Wednesday to uphold Presi-
dent Nixon’s veto of a bill which
would increase the minimum wage
to $2.20 an hour and extend
coverage to seven million new
workers, including household
maids.

The vote was 259 to 164 to
override the veto, but it fell 23
short of the necessary two-thirds
majority needed by the House. The
bill is now dead and will not be
voted on by the Senate.

It was the sixth time this year the
House has sustained a Nixon veto,
and the second time in as many
weeks.

Representative John H. Dent of
New Kensington, sponsor of the
bill, pointed out that if the bill had
been passed, it would have
benefitted students.

If a,student is working 20 hours a
week,” Dent said, “the load he is
carrying becomes a burden too
heavy for him. We’re trying to
keep kids in school.”

Dent defended the seemingly
large increase for minimum wage
earners his bill proposed. “We
are not jumping, as some have

said, we are crawling. These two
people haven't had a wage increase
in seven years.”

“People making $10,000 in 1967
are making, on the average,
$17,000 today,” Dent added.
“However, people making $1.60 in
1967 are still making $1.60 today.”

Jerome Zoffer, dean of Pitt’s_

Graduate School of Business, said
that the technical assistance

rendered by the students will be of ” '

a “management consulting’.’ na-
ture. “The development of

problems such as lack of support, ~

lack of financial know-how, and

others will be approached by the,

students with techniques learnedin
the University to get the business-
men back on their feet,” he said.

HEW granted a total of $9.3
million to colleges, universities,
state governments, and other
suppliers of higher education to
boost the productivity of such
education. Pitt is one of only 89
recipients culled from more than
1400 applicants.

Dean Zoffer said Pitt was chosen
because of the way the program is
set up. “The primary purpose of
the grant will be to fund evaluators
who will study the effectiveness of

the educational experience com- '

bined with the effect on the
community. ’ ’ 2
The SCP was established in 1969
by business school students,
although supported and encour-
aged by the school’s faculty-and
"community and business leaders,
students have planned, staffed and
managed SCP. «
“One of the advantage of the
_program,"’ Zoffer said, “is the
immediate application of techni-

ques the student- is learning. A’. Q l H

ghetto store has its share of
problems, yet it is small enough to

see immediate results when the

problems are rectified.

If a student learns something’

today and then years from now is
faced with the problem in a big
corporation like U.S. Steel, it would
be quite difficult to see any
concrete results from his efforts.

But if he is faced now with perhaps
a similar problem at Joe’s Fruit
Store, the results are immediate

and the learning experience is '3

enhanced. ’ ’

The SCP has aided enterprises
ranging from groceries and small
manufacturers to the NAACP and
Community Action Pittsburgh. It
also sponsors advisory sessions for
minority businessmen, seminars on

bookkeeping‘, studies of theBlack .

business community, and a direc-
tory of Black business in the
hill District. ‘ "

The Otgegon Republican said
corruption is a problem when
various federal agencies unsurp the
money needed for social programs
originating with the “New Deal”
and the “New Frontier”.

Hatﬁeld said this is precisely
why power should go back into the
hands of the local communities.

“And when programs do get
back to the neighborhoods,”
Hatﬁeld said, “‘it’s when minority
groups are ‘given’ a program but
without any participation in its

5 organization and administration.”

“This is nothing but white liberal
paternalism,” Hatﬁeld said.

Following his prepared speech,
Hatﬁeld discussed the issue of the
President and his tapes.

“When I was elected governor,”
Hatﬁeld said, “I did not say that I
would preserve, protect and defend
the laws, except when they applied
to me.

“And so when he puts himself
into that impasse (Nixon’s tape
conflict) there is only one way to
proceed out of that conﬂict, and
that is impeachment,” said Hat-
ﬁeld.

Chilean journalist Ramon
Alegria visited Pitt Wednesday,

Salvadore Allende’s fall from

domestic workers from the original
measure, but has refused.

“He has vetoed more bills than he
has signed,” Dent said of
President Nixon, “so that he no
longer uses the veto for the reasons
it was put into the Constitution. In
this case we are helpless and
hopeless.”

“Nixon has already.taken control
over the Supreme Court with the
appointments he has made, and
now he is taking over a con-
gressional majority with the power
of the veto,” Dent said.

Dent was irritated that Nixon
vetoed his minimum wage bill, but
in August the President recom-
mended that Civil Service em-
ployees receive a 4.77% pay
increase effective December 1.

According to the Civil Service
Commission in Washington,
Nixon’s suggestion would give
raises to 1.3 million civil workers,
and 2.2 million military personnel.

The maximum salary affected by‘

this ruling would be $36,000.

The Commission said that the.

measure will go

be democratiicly-elected_ president,
was opposed by the Christian
Democratic Party.

The 90 minute meeting, con-
ducted in Spanish and attended

mostly by Latin Americans at Pitt, '

was dominated by questions
concerning the role of the Christian
Democrats in the coup d’ etat.
Alegria prefaced his answers with
an account on the state of affairs in
Chile prior to the military take
over.

He described Chile as being in a
“state of Civil war.” He said a
serious food shortage and an
economic crisis produced violence,
and added there were deaths
almost every night. Alegria drew a
grim picture of social anarchy

which he said was produced by
both political extremes. '

The military’s action according
to Alegria was a response to a
background “with arms distributed
among civilians, and houses with
explosives; with brothers and
sisters, parents and children hating
each other; with friends who
wouldn’t greet each other on the
street; with a scarcity of basic
necessities, factories without raw
materials," and a situation where
50% or more of the technicians had
left the country.

Party, which had come in second

Alternatives Discussed

to $5 Add—Drop Fee

BY MARK ROMAN OFF
The $5" add-drop fee was
discussed at the Student Govern-
ment meeting Wednesday.
Several alternatives to the fee
were discussed, including an
in-depth view of each course and
the format of assignments.
According to Student Government
members, a prime reason for the
add-drop is confusion over the
contents of courses. They felt this
would eliminate the needless
paperwork and aggravation promp-
ted by the present circumstances.
Dutton maintains that the $5 fee
will continue until a solution is
discovered and implemented.
The Young Socialists’ Alliance
(YSA) was recognized as a
University organization. A re-

_ presentative of_ YSA infgrmed the

Board that her group is commonly
confused with SDS as far as
projects and goals.

She explained YSA is “an
activist and edcational organiza-
tion...an organization that has
played a key role in the anti-war
movement”.

Plans were made to revise the
criteria for appropriating organiza-
tional funds. This would reduce
the possibility of two groups
concerned with a similar activity
both being funded.

A discussion was begun con-

cerning the upcoming jazz seminar
organized by Nathan Davis. Since
the event will be partially funded
by Student Government, students
are assured of a certain number of
free tickets to the seminar and
concert October 10-12.

The Party felt that Allende could

At the same time, the supply of

Alegria reported that eight days
before the coup, Allende confessed
his thoughts about his present
political crisis to a friend held
common between the late Presi-
dent and Alegria. The friend then
told Alegria that Allende was
aware of his own delicate situation,
and that in case of attack, he could
not hold off the military for more
than two or three hours.

Allende said his supporters and
those who had “more resources”

military seized the power but that
“given no other way-out economic-
ally and politically, all the
opposition, with few exceptions,
was in agreement with the military
as far as taking power.”

Alegria believed that if the
military’s actidns had been delayed
for" another four months, the
casualty list would be 100 times
what it actually was.

Dr. A.J. Freile, a professor in
Pitt's geography department, took
issue with Alegria’s assertion that
there was united support for the
Chistian Democrats in the rural
areas of Chile. His question set off
a debate about the means by which
Latin American countries settle
their political problems.

Alegria is working on a series of
articles concerning life in the

prolonged because the Chilean
airports have temporarily closed

the administration,” he said, “and
to serve as an alternative for
students no one will listen to.”

The Cabinet is called an action

accent is on positive and construc-
tive change within the academic
system.

The Cabinet also forms a forum
for curriculum innovation, such as
the proposal they have made for
domestic cross-registration.

Cabinet members ‘called for a

“Our meetings are open to

explained Monahan “We are here
to serve the student, whether his

scholastic.”

According to Monahan the

. Cabinet has had a high percentage

of success in the past with its
programs and recommendations to

reform in the rules concerning

spoke out against the use of

Column and a Half

BY JOHN METCALFE
As a refreshing and pleasant change from the

‘usual tone of this part of the page, I would like to

praise a couple of local institutions. The ﬁrst is
WQED-FM, a splendid radio station which spent
Tuesday broadcasting from the Student Union here
at Pitt. Along with their turn tables and microphones
and such, they must have brought one of the larger
ampliﬁers in the world. It was not the ﬁrst time that
music somebody else had selected was played very
loud on campus, but for a change it was Bach instead
of rock.

The visit was intended to make us all more aware

, of the existence and the nature of WQED-FM, and I

hope it worked. The station has been sending out
“fine-arts programming” eighteen hours a day for
the last seven months; music, drama, discussion,

‘commentary and miscellany are included under the

general title. For some reason the eighteen hours of
the day they have chosen to ornament so finely occur
between six in the morning and midnight.

V, I might have chosen some other hours of operation,
letting everybody sleep a little longer so as to be able
to stay up late. This is not only because I hate to have
the music stop on the stroke of twelve, when the
evening is just getting its second wind, but also

because the thought of Mozart, or Scriabin, at six in
the morning affects me much like the thought of ‘
‘wedding cake, or pickles, for breakfast.

That was a_quibble. (Dog food which has been
ground into little lumps, like gravel, is “kibbled”.)
Beginning this week, WQED is rebroadcasting the
concerts of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, on

5 the Tuesday following the concert. as well as other
’  locally-originated musical programs; they are

working on a large studio to accomodate dramatic
material, but it will take a while. Partial schedules of
their programs are available in their own magazine,
“Pittsburgh Renaissance”, and in the weekly
These are useful, but not
necessary;you_ can tune in almost anytime (except
between midnight and six) and be pretty sure of

  

;~-findinglpsomething goodly WQED is easy to find, all

the way at the bottom of the FM dial, at 89.3
Megahertz.

The other institution I want to praise is the Bryn
Mawr-Vassar Book Store, just past Craig on Henry
Street. It has been open for about a year, except for
the summer when it was shut. I would have
mentioned it sooner, but I had a selﬁsh and malicious
reason for not doing so. For a long time I have
wanted to own a complete edition of the works of
Mark Twain. I have prowled the shelves of
bookstores and antique stores; I have haunted
garage sales and flea markets, all in this worthy
quest. All of this produced a few scattered volumes
from assorted editions, but not the cherished thing
itself.

In the past week the Bryn Mawr-Vassar people
received two complete sets, but others got to them
first, and I was unable to get them. Today, though,
another set arrived, and it is now mine. I paid ten
dollars for the twenty-tree volumes.

You may think this is a bargain, and it is.
However, the set I purchased was the deluxe edition,
the ﬁnest of the three; one of the others went for
three dollars. These prices are fairly typical.

The bookstore is an old four-room house equipped
with bookshelves around all its walls and tables and
crates of books, mostly in sets of which one volume is
displayed upstairs. There are ﬁrst editions,
paperbacks. texts. children's books. biographies...
almost any sort of book that can be named.

They are all startlingly cheap, and the turnover is
enormous. so a new crop is available almost every
week.

The books are donated, and the workers are
volunteers, so I suppose all proceeds go to the
support of the two colleges in the name of the store.

I have one problem. I live in an old house with
large rooms and high ceilings. I am gradually
covering all the walls with bookshelves. Extra books
are on tables and in boxes on the floor. The day will
surely come when I,too, can put up a sign and go into
business as the Bryn Mawr-Vassar Book Store.

At these prices, I will probably have all of their
books any year now. ‘ I

who promised to throw the whole

hamburgers and french fries were
on the advertised special and
induced my purchase. Only
afterward was I to find out that
there was no ketchup or mustard to
be had. Incredible!!! Did you ever
advertise Tuck Shop hamburgers
with no ketchup or mustard?

This points up the lack of a
decent daily special similar to those
available in the Tuck Shop last
spring. Withla captive market to
prey on, is the best we can be

‘offered only dry hamburgers?

Student Gov't and the University
administration (if not the County
Health Dept.) should investigate

this appalling lack of sanitation.

Good Writers Bad Sports

“Nature’s chief masterpiece is
writing well.”----John Sheffield,
ESSAY ON POETRY

BY GEORGE ZRUST

Every once in a while, I am so
overwhelmed with a weakness for
printed matter that I will even read
an article or two on some
newspaper's sports pages.

This is a very bad condition to be
in, and fortunately I do not
experience it very often. I

I do not, however. read scores.
Numbers are the realm of college
mathemeticians and back-room
bookies, and I belong to neither
class.

Nor do I read about the injuries
sustained by some part of a

particular player's anatomy. Ever ‘

since I learned that “trick knees"
do not even disappear or play dead,
my interest in such subjects has
been absolutely nil.

I will occasionally read an article
reporting the results of some auto
race. While I do not honestly
consider rubber-tired competition
to be “sports”, I am still proud to
say that I have gone so far as to
read a real “sports” article.

But the real kicker comes when I
digest some column on. say, a
football player. Human‘ interest
stories always warm the cockles of
my sweatsocks. .

One story that truly touched me
appeared in a local paper within the
past week. It concerned an
all-American lad who is upset
about his “dumb” image.

Among the many poignant
observations in the column was
inserted an even more poignant
fact: this athlete haspublished an
autobiography with the help of a
free-lance writer.

I am tempted to say that I note
here a certain dichotomy; but I'll
let that rest since I'm not in a cruel

~ mood right now. Maybe late;-_

The important thing is that the
athlete is not a writer. And since
the writer is indeed a writer, I
assume he is not an athlete (if I’m
Wmﬂg» Say so, and save me the
research). -

The story is a familiar one. One
man channels his talents towards
life's physical side, the other man
his talents toward the intellectual.
B0th- h0W€\/er. need each other.

Since I am. though. a scribe of
sorts. I have long been fascinated
with the writer's position.
Especially the writer who is a

regular sports writer.

In my experience, the guys who
write best about sports are not the
athletes at all.

An example is in order, namely a
high school classmate who was
famous for his love of the Green
Bay Packers. I'll refer to the fan as
“Lombardi".

Lombardi had at his command a
knowledge of sports that would
make Howard Cosell cringe.

Ever since I ﬁrst knew Lombardi
in grade school. he had sports
magazines in his hands. Wrestling
journals whose pages bulged with
the likes of Sammartino and
countless, sinewy lady wrestlers.

Later the standard Lombardi
publication became Sports Illus-
trated. This was supplemented by
some poorly-printed, but apparent-
ly very interesting, sports tabloid.

And as far as I knew, Lombardi
did a pretty good job with words.

Lombardi did not. however, do
too well with a football or
basketball. being as coordinated as
a set of long-johns in a hurricane.
He walked like a 55-year old barfly.

Whether or not Lombardi will
become a professional sports-
writer, I cannot say. He would fit
the role perfectly if he did.

Sportswriters I have known of
were similarly unendowed, being
too small, too fat, too uncoordin-
ated or too weak to even attempt
sports. Others though, were
merely flops as jocks.

One exception was a college
athlete I read about who was
journalism major. He did, by the
way, agree with my comments
about sports reporters.

I may, however, be overlooking
one alternative explanation.

That is, certain prospective
athletes may feel that the more
active side of the athletic business
promotes a “dumb” image they
fear worse than the athlete I
mentioned previously.

So they choose a sportswriting
career where they win two ways:
first, as intellectuals, they become
respected, accomplished, and
widely read writers.

Secondly, they display a full-
blown dedication to athletics.
thereby making them normal
American men whose masculinity.
no matter how tenuous, can never
be questioned.

Perhaps sportswriters. more
than any other type of weak-
hammed intellectuals, are saying
that it is much more respectable to
throw -words than it is to throw
balls. *

Chile

Dear Editor:

Implications have been made by
some reporters that the recent,
violent overthrow of the govern-
ment of President Salvador Allende
of Chile will beneﬁt the United
States. In my opinion. these
speculations are misleading, and
serve only to obscure the "real

. issues.

While the coup may prove
beneficial to the owners of several
U.S. industries which import
products form Chile, it must
certainly will not beneﬁt either
Chilean or American workers. For
example, control of many raw
materials companies will probably
be returned to U.S.-based
multinational corporations which
for decades have exploited workers
in Chile and in other developing
nations, paying them only a small

fraction of what they would have to v

pay American workers to do the
same jobs. As a result, many
goods which are sold by U.S. firms
will continue to be produced.
totally or in part. by foreign labor,
especially Asian and Latin Ameri-
can. thereby depriving American
workers of employment oppor-
tunities.

A striking example of this kind of
American industrial imperialism
came to light last year when it was
learned that International Tele-

phone and Telegraph Corp. (ITT)
had sought assistance from the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
for the purpose of bringing about
economic chaos in Chile which
would result in the collapse of the
government of President Allende.
At first, spokesmen for both ITT
and the CIA denied that this
communication had taken place,
but later they were forced to admit
that it had, in fact, occurred.

More recently, the Justice
Department's decision not to
reopen the controversial case
concerning the alleged promise of
the Sheraton Corporation (an ITT
subsidiary) to underwrite the cost
of the 1972 Republican National
Convention in return for immunity
from anti-trust legislation relative
to ITT’s merger with the Hartford
Fire Insurance Company is proof of
the immense political and financial
pressures which continually are
exerted at the highest levels of
government by these multinational
giants.

In view of these facts, I suggest it
is highly probable that the U.S.
Government with the blessing of
large corporate interests, was in
some manner active in precip-
itating conditions which led to the
recent coup in Chile. I therefore
encourage every concerned student
to write to President Nixon and to
Congress in support of legislation
calling for a full disclosure of the
budget—activities of all U.S. intel-
ligence organizations, both dome-

stic and international, and
especially the CIA.
Sincerely,

Black-Jewish Com‘IicfDiscussed

BY CHARLES VERBISH
“The only way blacks can
control their lives is through

economic power,” said Robert R.
Lavelle, black businessman and
executive board member of the
National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP). Lavelle participated in a
panel discussion of the Black and
Jewish experience in American last
night at the Intercultural House.

According to Lavelle, “The only
thing people are really concerned
about is property. Therefore, it is
necessary for the property interests
of the people to be threatened
before they will pay attention to the
plight of others.

“This was first realized in 1956
in Montgomery, Ala. when the

people boycotted the bus company

until it went bankrupt.”
Dr. Barbra Shore, professor at

The Graduate School of Social
Work and chairperson of the
Coalition of Human Needs here at
Pitt, said “The history of bl-acks
and Jews is similiar in that both
were scsapegoats; in America and
Europe respectively.

There are boys who need

who need someone to talk to.
Kids who need tutors.

“The obvious dissimilarities are
that the Jews were able to
assimilate into American culture
becaue of skin color and urban
skills, principally in business,
which they had practiced in
Europe.

“The black man,” she con-
tinued, “has had great difficulty in
blending into a predominantly
white society and initially pos-
sessed skills acquired in a rural
area which failed him in an
increasingly urban society.”

The random survey method
employed by Jeannine Henry, a
professor at the School of Social
Work and member of the executive
committee of the Urban Research
Center, revealed “There is no one
black perception of the Jew.

“The black does not see the Jew

6-4; 6-3; 6-3

as a minority that has made it. and
they admire their quest for
education and solidarity as an
ethnic group while putting down
their own aspirations in these
areas."

Rabbi Phillip Sigal, director of
B’nai B’rith Hillel-Jewish Univ-
ersity Ministry Center, stated “The
Jew has had it much better here
than in Europe from colonial times
today. The separation of Church
and state is the reason for this.
Jews are not persecuted by a state
church as they were in Russia.”

Sigal also said, “Those blacks
who have turned to Islam have
overlooked the fact that the
Muslims were and are the biggest
slave traders in Africa."

King Trounces Riggs in ‘Sexes Battle’

HOUSTON AP -- Audacious
Billie Jean King struck a blow at all
male chauvinists by crushing
Bobby Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 last night
in their circus-like, $100,000
winner-takeall tennis Battle of the
Sexes at the Astrodome.

A wild roar went up from the
30,472 fans in the huge air-con-
ditioned areana when Bobby
dumped a weak forehand shot into
the net for the final shot.

Billie Jean, leading 5-3 with
Riggs serving, earlier blew two
match points with week shots into
the net for errors.

At the end of the match, while
skyrockets ﬂared on the big
Astrodome scoreboard and the
University of Houston bad played a
martialtun, the happy Mrs. King
ﬂung her racket high in the air and
hurdled the net in traditional
fashion.

The 55-year-old, bespectacled
Riggs was tired, rubbery-legged

old man at the finish.

“She was just too good for me,”
he acknowledged ungrudgingly,
rubbing his chronicly sore right
elbow. “She was much too quick
and made better shots than I did.”

The veteran Riggs, Wimbledon
and world champion now turned
sports hustler, was just a shell of
the man who defeated Australia's
Margaret Court in San Diego May
13 in what he rakishly termed the
Mother’s Day Massacre.

The duck footed little preacher’s
son, who turned his victory into .a
million dollar hustle, appeared now

to be bankrupt as far as any future‘

such hustles were concerned.
“Where can Bobby go from here?”
everybody asked.

“Maybe I will take on the
winning golfers,” the dejected
Riggs said. “I could play them
from the women’s tees. l hit the
ball about the way a woman does.”

There was a tense moment after

the sixth game ofthe final set when

the players did not promptly return '

said the reason was that Riggs and
developed hand cramps. It was
thought there might be a default at
this point but it did not take place.

Riggs came onto the court to win
the seventh game on service.

Bobby double-faulted at set point
in losing the first set. He was
broken twice in the second set,
largely on Billie Jean’s net rushing
assault and slashing backhand
volley and he appeared a broken,
beaten man in the third set-
although he stayed in there
swinging.
Billie Jean was borne into the huge
domed arena on a litter like an
Egyptian Cleopatra. The litter was
carried by four muscled men with
others leading the way carrying
plumes on long sticks.

Riggs, not to be outdone, was a
Kubla Khan as he was hauled into
the stadium over a gold carpet on a

Oyster Cult: Latest Wax

BY SYLVESTER BENDER

There are a few newly released
discs ﬂoating around that you
might want to cash in on. A

If you want to hear the Allman
Brothers latest. don't buy it. just
listen to somebody else's. The
album has only been out a month
and has already sold over a million

‘copies. so it won't be hard to find

one.

Blue Oyster Cult has emerged
from New York City and is
presently on a massive tour. Their
brand of music is outrageously
hard rock with a touch of mysticism
and once they get a hold of you,
they won’t let go! Lead guitarist,
Buck Dharma is reputed to be by
some critics as America’s best rock
guitarist. I wouldn't stick my neck
out that far, but he sure is worth
listening to. They are presently
trying to release their third alubm,
but don’t wait for it. Get their
second, Tyranny and Mutation.

Z Z Top is a blues band from
Texas. and they can get down. For
only three dudes. they find some
nice grooves and are comparable
to Grand Funk, Beck-Bogart-
Appice. or any other tightly knit
trio. By the way Grand Funk has
surprisingly accepted another mem-
ber and due to his vocals the sound
of the band has changed immense-
ly. Oh, well, back to Z Z Top who
have just released their third and

’C latest album entitled “Tres Him-

bres.” Before even listening to it. I
noticed that one cut on the album
was called “Beer Drinker and Hell
Raisers" so I knew it had to be
good. The album has some nice
slide on it as does “Rio Grande
Mud,” their second LP. and should
give them some of the recognition
that they deserve.

or at the door.

After witnessing Poco’s perfor-
mance at the Mosque a few weeks
ago, they raised themselves about
twenty-five notches up on my
favorite group list. I was never
really convinced of their top notch
sound until I saw them live. The
loss of Jim Messina seems only to
be a minor one, as there were few
musical or vocal gaps. Rusty
Young was very impressive on
pedal steel, banjo, the bear [a
brand new instrument] and every-
thing else that he managed to get
his hands on.

If you're a J. Geils fan and you
haven't got Bloodshot yet, well
what are you waiting for. I do the
“Southside Shuffle" to school just
about every day. and on the way
home I go “Struttin’ With My
Baby." Mr. Magic Dick is back on
the lickin’ stick blowing his face
out. and Peter Wolf is as crazy as
ever. Few bands are as dynamic as
this one...don’t miss ‘em live.

Some good acts coming into town
include the Grateful Dead, Moody
Blues. Joe Walsh, and the Doobie
Brothers.

Coming Events at Heinz Hall

The orchestra has added five new
members to its group this season.

The new members are: Samuel
Cristler (Celo Section); Jerry
Horner (Principal Viola); Marc

Jeanneret (Assistant Principal Vio-
la); Adriana Anca (Principal Harp)
and Barbara Fraser (First Violin
Section).

Rosen noted that the symphony
has changed its radio affiliation.
The concert schedules will be
broadcast over WQED instead of

WWSW. The change is due to the
fact that WQED is an educational
and non-profit station. has a strong
FM signal and carries symphonic
music.

Although this is the third
consecutive season that concert
tickets have been sold out. Rosen
noted that many people often don't
show up, leaving 50 to 100 vacant
seats. These tickets can be pur-
chased the night of the perfor-
mance.

Thomas McGuane, in his early
thirties is the author of three
novels. His latest work, Ninety-
Two in the Shade is a book that,
although slightly flawed, is consis-
tently entertaining and ultimately
very moving.

Ninety-Two in the Shade is set in
a present-day Key West. the
book’s main character, Thomas
Skelton, has dabbled in drugs and
education and decides that he
wants to become a fishing guide for
tourists.“ In search of something to
provide meaning for his life, he
decides that fishing is more
important and relevant to him than
biology books. Besides, guiding is
the only activity he’s found he is
good at.

Nichol Dance, a more experienced
guide, decides to play a practical
joke on Skelton. The joke backfires
and Skelton destroys Dance’s boat,
his livelyhood. Dance, who
witnesses his boat going up in
ﬂames, tries to ﬁnd Skelton and kill
him. Although Dance likes Skelton
and regrets the prank, he later tells
the younger man that if he tries to
guide, he’ll kill him.
Dance, cannot back down and

One of the book’s biggest assets is
McGuane’s talent for characteriza-

The humor is useful in preventing

Pionisl Firkusny

Pianist Rudolf Firkusny will
perform with the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra at Heinz Hall
September 21 and 23, returning for
his fifth appearance with the
Orchestra since 1968. This is the
second concert of the Symphony's
1973-74 subscription series.

Music Director William Steinberg
will conduct the concert, beginning
with Elgar’s “Cockaigne” Over-
ture, followed by Concerto for
String Orchestra by
Michael Tippett and the Dvorak
Concerto in g minor for Piano and
Orchestra, Opus 33.

Firkusny’s career as a pianist
spans over 40 years. He has
performed with the world’s great-
est orchestras and their conduc-
tors, including with the Berlin,
London, Czech, Los Angeles and
New York Philharmonic, and the
BBC, Vienna, Boston, Chicago,
San Francisco and Concertgebouw
Symphony orchestras. i ii

A native Czechoslovakian,
Firkusny fled his home city of
Napajedla at the height of his
youthful career in 1941. Previously
he was considered a child prodigy
who made his debut at the age of 10

with the Prague Philharmonic
Orchestra. Four years later he
made his first appearance in

Vienna and by the age of 18 was

well known throughout Europe.

During World War II he ﬂed to
Paris and eventually to the U.S.
without any loss of artistic
accomplishment. Following his
New York recital debut in 1941
TIME Magazine noted he played

“with poise and maturity of a.‘

master “Firkusny is now a United
State citizen and has performed in
every major American music
festival and concert series. He has

‘also completed 25 full tours of

Europe, 11 to South America, 12
to Mexico, three to Israel and two
tours of Australia. Firkusny is a
recording artist for such presti-
gious labels as Decca, Deutches
Grammophon and Capitol; the
latter featuring him in a perfor-
mance of Beethoven’s “Emperor
Concerto” with William Steinberg
and the Pittsburgh Symphony.
The Heinz Hall performances are
scheduled for Friday, Saturday,

September 21 and 22 at 8:30 p.m. Q

Still looking for his first victory

action against the Baylor Bears

Majors will rely basically on the
same game-plan that the Cats used
against the Bulldogs. This means
that Billy Daniels will again start at
quarterback. and that freshman
sensation Tony Dorsett will do the
bulk of Pitt's running.

“I can't say how pleased l’ve
been with the way Daniels has
handled the offense,” said Majors,
“and Dorsett, well, last week he
was as poised as any freshman.‘-l

Dorsett will not be the only

kick-off and punt returns again,
and Carson Long will be doing the

BY BART MACK

\ Associate Sports Editor
For those of you that have taken Pitt's tie with Georgia as the first
step in Johnny Major's redirection of the Pitt football program. your
enthusiasm is not without due justification. However, enthusiasm
bordering on frenzy. which should very well fill Pitt Stadium tomorrow.
can cloud the eyes of objectivity. No guilt should be felt in taking the
bait. But don't swallow the hook, yet.

Surely the 7-7 tie with Georgia is a Major step in establishing a proud
tradition. even a winning tradition in Pitt football. It was quite obvious
that Pitt was the better team on the field in Athens. >

There is an unwritten rule of sorts that declares that sportswriters
who sit in the pressbox to cover games refrain from exhibiting their
emotions in any outward fashion, no matter which team their
sentiments happen to lie with.

But in the pressbox of Sanford Stadium that rule was broken several
times and I must admit to being; one of the guilty culprits. The silence
of those proud Southern writers was something to experience. I
couldn’t pass up the opportunity to make sure that they knew I was
from Pittsburgh, and proud to be.

But after the game there were several facts that stood out in my mind
that had to overshadow the ﬁnal outcome and the Panthers’
performance. You might want to label those facts as conclusions that I
have reached in my own way. I prefer to call them observations. And
facts.

Pitt definitely outplayed the Bulldogs. When the fourth quarter rolled
around. the Panthers had withstood the Georgia temperatures better
than the Bulldogs did. Thanks to Majors’ rigorous preseason training
and constant conditioning we were in better physical shape. An
interesting point to note is that Georgia had quit conditioning after only
three days. upon returning from preseason camp.

Georgia had to hold Pitt to the 7-7 tie. The Panthers obviously had the
better opportunities to put points on the board. At times, the Pitt
squad looked like a mature, well rounded ball club. At other times the
inexperience that accompanies a team with young members carrying
important loads glared everyone in the face.

The Panther punter. Larry Swider. is a freshman. Any punter, no
matter what his age. has his work cut out for him when he punts 11
times in a single afternoon. Swider, admittedly overly nervous.
before last week's game. now has a game under his belt He Will
develop into a vital cog of the Pitt attack.

The Pitt soccer team will go into
action again tomorrow afternoon at
West Chester State College in
possibly the most important game
of the young season. The West
Chester contest has always been a
tough one for the Panthers. and
this game should be no exception.

West Chester has basically the
same team as last year. a team
which defeatd Army and Strouds-
burg. two teams which eventually
made the NCAA playoffs. Never-
theless, the young West Chester
team was only able to chalk up a
4-6-2 mark for the season. scoring
14 goals to its opponents 17.

One of the two West Chester ties
came against the Panthers as the
two teams battled to a 1-1 score last
year in Pitt Stadium. Pitt led
throughout most of the contest
until West Chester finally scored
on a penalty kick late in the second
half. But. this year's meeting
should prove to be even tougher for
the Panthers.

“West Chester is expecting an
improved season,” said Pitt coach
Leo Bemis. “They always have a
very well conditioned team, and
they play a hard-nosed sort of
game. This will be West Chester’s

play was only seven yards.

A total of five Baylor players
attended Wharton Junior College,
alma mater of Burley. “Pitt just
outrecruited us,” admitted Baylor
head coach Grant Teaff.

The Baylor running game will be
spearheaded by Gary Lacy, a senior
who attended Wharton, and
Godfrey White. a senior from Tyler
Junior College.

Baylor will operate out of the Slot
I formation on offense. and
defensively line up in a 5-2, similar
to Pitt's. The big man for the
Baylor defense is monster Tommy
Turnipseede. who, believe it or not.
has strange eating habits.

first game but our squad knows
they’ll have to be ready for a tough
contest.”

The Panthers will go into this
contact with a record of 1-1. The
win came in the opening game of
the season against Geneva College.

The loss came at the hands of
Bucknell University last Saturday
afternoon when the Bisons scored a
fluke goal in the final seconds of
play to cop a 1-0 victory.

The Pitt booters have been
working hard all week in prepara-
tion for this week's game. Center
Joe Luxbacher and halfback Denny
Kohlmeyer suffered slight injuries
in last weeks game and are doing
their best to be ready on Saturday.
Coach Bemis doesn't foresee any
lineup changes from last week and
he feels the team can get the job
done.

‘‘We’ll be going with the same
team as last week." he said. “It's
just a matter of putting it all
together. Ife Joe ai..1 Denny are
healthy. we'll be able to give West
Chester all they can handle."

The booters need a big win
Saturday to get rolling again. They
are now getting into the roughest
part of their schedule. and they
can't afford another loss if they

have any hope of making the NCAA
playoffs. The squad's next home
game will be played in Pitt Stadium
on Sept. 26 against a powerful
Akron team.» A win over West

need. but it won't come easy.

The Other Side

(Continued from Page 9)

Bill Daniels ran the option around both ends quite frequently and did
not fumble once. Nor did he pitch back to Tony Dorsett in a bad fashion
once. On several of the option plays, Daniels turned the corners on the
keep with the ball carried in an out streatched arm, or more commonly
refered to as a “loaf of bread." He did not fumble once.

The fact remains that teams that do run the option as a basic part of
their offensive strategy do fumble. Oklahoma, Nebraska and Texas are
prime examples. Whether the team runs the option from the wishbone
or an I formation makes no difference. Expect some fumbles.

Pitt and Georgia both received some lucky breaks, another
unforseeable part of each game. Somehow, Pltt’s were a bit more
dramatic. Return specialist Bob Haygood doesn't seem to believe in a
fair catch. He was hit once upon catching the ball and was sent ﬂying
backwards. Somehow he held onto the ball. On another Bulldog punt,
he tried to make a shoestring catch and keep on running. He missed
the ball but managed to jump back on it in time. Turnovers on those
plays would have put Georgia in excellent ﬁeld position.

Now when Pitt takes the ﬁeld tomorrow against Baylor, don't expect
everything to go wrong for the Panthers. In fact, when Pitt leaves the
ﬁeld with their first victory of the 1973 season, take some other factors
into consideration.

Baylor is going into the game with four key injuries. The Bears had
the living daylights kicked out of them by Oklahoma last week and are
hurting. Last year Grant Teaff took over a program that resembled
Pitt’s and won five games. For all practical purposes, he wasn’t
supposed to win any.

Baylor was in every game that they played last year, with the
exception of one. They are a gutsy ball club but overall are smaller
than Pitt, especially on the offensive line. They boast nine running
backs as speedsters, running the 40 yard dash in 4.8 seconds or less. I
don't consider that to be speed but there are two variations of what can
be termed speed; one is just running and the other is running when
someone is running at you.

For the ﬁrst time in a long while, a Pitt opponent is being spotted
points. The Panthers are ﬁve or six point favorites for the home opener
and I wouldn't be surprised to see Pitt win by three touchdowns. But
even if they do, I still won’t let enthusiasm become wide frenzy.

The real test to determine the immediate success of Johnny Majors
lies in the future, the very near future. Northwestern and Tulane are
the very near future. An immediate rags to riches metamorphisis runs
along the lines of the Cinderella fairytale. The clock can still strike
twelve for Pitt and the trouble is that we don’t know what time it is.

as as as as as

Panther Prints--~ ....Last week in Georgia, at the
start of the fourth quarter, the entire Pitt squad raised their hands with
four ﬁngers out to indicate that they were very much alive. Coach
Majors is hoping that the Pitt student body will adopt the gesture for
every Pitt home game.

John Curley

Tmall But Versatile

BY G.W. STEVENS
At 5’-7", John Curley is the
smallest member of the Pitt soccer
team. He has proven to be a fine
defensive player as well as a threat
on the attack. Curley is one of the

three ﬁne halfbacks on the Pitt.

squad around whom much of the
play is centered. He must be able
to drop back and play tough
defense but be ready to take

advantage of any opportunity to
move the team forward.

For such a small guy, Gurly plays
very well on defense. His speed
and agility have enabled him to go
up against larger opponents. His
speed has also helped him greatly
in moving the ball up ﬁeld. At one
point in last week's game against
Bucknell, Curly was even called
upon to move up to the wing

position in an attempt to get the
offense moving. 4 ‘

“I really don’t know why Coach
Bemis moved me up to the front
line,” confessed Curly. “He had
never done that before, but I guess
he was just trying to get us moving.

I prefer to play at the halfback

spot.”

Big Ball Keeps IM Scores Lox ?

BY RICK SHRUM

Two weeks ago, when Intramural
Director Leo Bemis ﬁrst announced
that a new, larger ball, a
pumpkin-in-disg-uise, would be
introduced to the fall softball
program, the general reaction was,
“Who cares? We'll still pound the
s--- out of it.” I

After each team’s inaugural
game, the opinion was quite
different. What will happen to the
offensive part of the game, they
wondered. Will we now have to
rely on speed and defense to win?
What fun is, the game without the
long-ball?

That type of thinking went down
the commode Wednesday night, as
defending fraternity champ Pi
Lambda Phi outscored previously
unbeaten Delta Sigma Chi, 8-6, for
their second victory in as many
starts.

The Pi Lambs unleashed a
fearful ten-hit attack to secure thier
second victory, which was broken
open with a four-run second inning.

Winning pitcher Jerry Iwler
opened the second with a one-base
rap, and scored on battery-mate Ira
Gumberg’s single. Consecutive
singles by »Mike Chosky, Benjy
Hadberg. and Bob Marcus, made it
3-0, and Mark Hoffman’s clutch hit

with two out gave the Phi Lambs an_

early four run lead.
That four-run lead held going
into the home half of the fourth,

when Delta Sigma Chi decided that '

they'd better do something about
their predicament.

Nunzio Tanase started the rally
with a two-out single, that was
mis-played into two bases. Joe
Giovannitti stepped to the plate,
and cracked an Iwler delivery
through the outfield, for a two-run
homer. Denny Baltzer continued
the long-ball onslaught with a
triple, and scored on a bad relay to
the inﬁeld, to cut the Phi Lamb lead
to 5-4.

The Pi Lambs regained their

four-run lead the next inning; with -

three unearned tallies. With one
out, Bob Broorman reached second
safely on a double-error. He went
to third on Iwler’s mishandled
grounder to the box, and crossed
the plate when Steve Klein’s fly
ball was dropped, the fourth’ error
of the inning. Gumberg scored
Iwler with a fly ball and Chosky
ﬁnished the Pi Lamb scoring, by
driving Klein home with a hit to
left.

Delta Sigma Chi did not threaten
the Pi Lamb lead until the seventh,
when they sent two unearned runs
across the plate. However, the
threat ended when Iwler induced

Larry Schaeffer and Bill Mclntyre
to bounce to the inﬁeld.

With two victories under their
belts, the defending champs
appear to be shoo-ins for the
playoffs once again. As winning
hurler Jerry Iwler stated, “We now
have our toughest games out of the
way.” Quite possibly, Jerry. Butif

easy time defending your title.

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Middle guard Gary Burley.
defensive end Jim Buckmon, and
monster back Mike Bulino grabbed
all the defensive headlines last
Saturday afternoon in Georgia, but
when the the final evaluation came
in, it was decided that senior
linebacker Rod Kirby had played
the best game of them all.
(‘When the ﬁnal facts were
digested by the very happy Pitt
coaching staff, Kirby had tab-
ulated eight individual tackles and

Didn’t Hurt

(Continued from Paye10)

for ﬁve years just prior to coming to
Pitt. The high school he attended,
Kiski Area, had no soccer program.
He did get a good background for
the sport however while he lived in
England. His experience has
enabled him to break into the
lineup and play with fine style.
Curly feels the Panthers have a
very good team despite the recent
loss to Bucknell. “There is no
reason why we can't win the rest of
our games. It simply a matter of
getting everything together. We
actually have a great team and the
guys really play well together."
The lack of fan support doesn't
really bother Curly as much as
some of the other members of the

six assisted ones. .. He received 29
plusses and 19 minuses and.
overall, graded a 71 per cent. And,
according to his defensive coach
Jackie Sherrill. Rod Kirby is a
welcome commodity.

“I'm a tough grader." Sherrill
admitted Thursday night. “In my
estimation, you have to grade at 65
per cent to be a winner. Kirby had
29 plusses and 19 minuses and that
comes from being around the
ball."

Kirby is not a new face at Pitt.
He has led a “Who He?” career,

Gurle y

team. He does admit, however, tht
it would be nice to get a larger
crowd at some of the big games.
“After you play in front of small
crowds for a couple of games, you
get used to it. Let’s face it, Pitt’s
committed to football. If the
football team starts to win, it will
help all the other teams. Then
maybe the people will come out to
see us.

The Pitt soccer team
entering into the toughest part of
their entire schedule. If they are to
be successful this season, they
must be able to get good play from
their crew of halfbacks. John Curly
has proved that he can do the job.
But. there are quite a few games
left, and just about anything could
happen.

But Sherrill sounds I

convincing when he already says,

“I wish he was coming back next

99

year.

What distinguished Rod above

the other defensive performances
in Athens, was his ability to make
the big play. With 1:54 left in the
shocker. Kirby and Iinebacking
mate Kelcy Daviston were back on
pass coverage and both teamed
with defensive Back Jeff Hartin to
make the play which gave the Cats
one last chance to come up
winners.

“After he (Bulldog tight end
Rich Appleby) made the catch,
Jeff (Hartin) hit him, Kelcy
(Daviston) pulled the ball away.
and I recovered the fumble. I was
at the right place at the right
time." Kirby said.

The fact that there were three
men around the ball on that play,
was no accident. It seems to be the
new Pitt defensive trademark...
that is. persuit and gang tackling.
And that was brought about by
design.

 

Kirby a Physical Education
major at the University, comes off
like a man with a PhD in speech.

“I think it's too early to tell if we
have a good team," Kirby said, in
response to a questions about the
realness of the defensive unit. “I
still think we have to prove
ourselves. Baylor is a strong
running team and the true test for
us will to keep on doing the job.
It's not going to be easy, but it
gives us something to work for.

“We've worked hard since last
winter.” Kirby added, “and last
week helped us to get going, but
we need a victory against Baylor."

Johnny Majors couldn’t have
said it better.

“Kirby is a very intelligent kid,”
Sherrill added. “He makes all the

 . Kirby Plays Best Game Of All

defensive calls for us. He's got
good speed (4.7) for a linebacker
and he hits."

To those who have watched Rod
close, the fact that he hits goes
without dispute. Against Notre
Dame's Eric Penick last year. he
made a brutally devastating
tackle--one which even the partisan
Irish fans seemed to enjoy. With
Kirby, hard hitting is habitual.

“I take PRIDE in the fact that I
hit hard,” he said. “I’mjust trying
to play the game the best I can.”

Against Baylor tomorrow, the

possibility of a letdown is there.
After such a promising perfor-
mance last week. Majors hopes his
players don’t become satisfied with
themselves. If Kirby's remarks are
indicative, that's a remote pos-
sibility.
"i’m glad I got the award,” Kirby
assured. “But, there’s a ‘Bad Cat’
award given out after each game to
the player who makes the best hit
in the game. Mike Bulino won that
award last week. I'd like to get it
against Baylor."

From here, that doesn't sound
like a satisfied athlete.
