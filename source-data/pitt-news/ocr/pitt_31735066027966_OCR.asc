Allocations choir claims SGB abuses power

$7,000 dinner denied, but student government overrules decision

Should Student Government Board
be exempt from the same allocations
process that all other student organiza-
tions must go through to obtain funds
for events?

Allocations Committee Chair
Noelle Carnpagna says no, and accuses
the SGB of bending the rules for their
own benefit. ,

The Student Government Board
submitted an emergency request last
week for $6982.30 in order to host a
dinner honoring organizations on cam-
pus.

In a program justification submitted
to Allocations, SGB lists the dinner as
“a program that will recognize our out-
standing afﬁliate student organizations
and leaders.” The justification letter
added that SGB will also recognize fac-
ulty and staff that stand out with stu-
dents.

According to Campagna, SGB
failedto follow the allocations process
when requesting the money. Rather than
asking Allocations for approval of the
sum, Board member Marquette
Bowman sent out ﬂyers and applica-

 

tions announcing the dinner before
obtaining Allocations’ approval for
money to pay for the meal.

By advertising the event before the
money was approved, Bowman violat-
ed the allocation by-laws.

SGB first asked for $5590.54, with
nearly 200 people invited to the dinner.
The cost was broken down between the
meal, renting the Commons room of the
Cathedral of Learning, programs, invi-
tations, and the cost of the awards.

On Feb. 12, Allocations deferred
the request until they were better
informed on how the money would be
used for each item. ’

In a second expense itemization,
SGB asked Allocations to approve an
emergency request of $6982.30, with
the bulk paying for the meal and a por-
tion to purchase awards. The date for
the dinner was also changed to April 13,
and expected attendance was increased
to 300 people.

In the second request, SGB elimi-
nated the money they had asked for
facility maintenance because they had
moved the dinner from the Commons
Room of the Cathedral to the William

Pitt Union Assembly Room.

Murphy says Pittsburgh must keep university students to boost economy

 

, Mayor Tom Murphy visited the
University Honors College on Friday
and said the roles of the region and
local universities will be crucial in the
rejuvenation of the Pittsburgh economy
and a focus of his campaign.

Speaking to a group of around 40

people, Murphy discussed how
Pittsburgh’s surrounding regions and
schools are essential to the success of
drawing new businesses into the area.
He said he hopes to draw people to the
surrounding areas which support the
city and get more students to stay after
they graduate. ,

“The region needs to succeed for
Pittsburgh to succeed,” he said.

When he came into office, Murphy.
said he was faced with the task of halt-
ing a city-wide population which had
literally dwindled in half — from near-
ly 720,000 at the turn of the century to

360,000 in a more recent cens .

building that number back up.

closings has been to launch billions of
dollars’ worth of development plans.
These plans are directed specifically at
improving thecity as -a living environ-

ment, both economically and environ-
mentally.

“The city is defining itself moreso
than any city in America,” said Murphy.
“Being mayor of a city at this time is a
challenge.” .

In building that number up, Murphy
said he has developed a city which
works symbiotically with the region.

“I want to eliminate the ‘them and
us’ theory [between the city and the
region].”

He said Pittsburgh hosts a number
of regional assets which benefit the area
by attracting employers, and in turn it
draws off of the surrounding popula-
tions for economic survival.

Overall, said Murphy, the city has
once again become a draw for those
considering the regional market as a
place to build and develop industries.

“While companies grew and started
around us, young people left,” said
begun to change

since the ‘80s.”

Murphy said the city has a “clearly
competitive advantage” because of its
higher education institutions.

“Universities are the major reason
we have significant success stories of
companies growing up here,” he said.

Murphy said development is only
reinforcing that advantage.

Citing one example, Murphy said
that in the last 2 years, 20 miles of
Pittsburgh’s waterfront land has seen
$600 million worth of development.

He discussed the slag—dump—
turned—urban4subdivision of
Washington’s Landing, formerly Herr’s
Island, just under the 30th Street bridge
on the Allegheny river downtown.

The island has seen a l80—degree
turn from its previous role as a waste
dump to a thriving district which hosts
a rowing club and a growing business

Murphy.

Murphy said he thinks these clean-
up and move—in projects will become a
national model of the city’s success
over economic stagnation and environ-
mental havoc. :

But improvement is as important as
development, and Murphy said con-
struction began last week for a new
pedestrian bridge hanging beneath the
Fort Duquesne Bridge downtown. He
also explained plans for a riverfront
park which will wander from Point
Park along the Allegheny.

These measures are all part of what
Murphy called his “plan to shape
Pittsburgh as a destination.”

“I believe a struggle that makes a
city a success is a struggle for its soul.”
said Murphy. “In America, we struggle
for what our cities are  we need com-
merce and culture.”

Allocations

They also eliminated the request for
money for programs and invitations,
because SGB plans on using their own
printing resources to print them.

On March 11, Allocations denied the
second request, saying that the alloca-
tions process had not been followed
because Bowman advertised the event
before the money was approved.

At Wednesday night’s Board meet-
ing, the SGB overturned Allocations’
denial of the request.

Brian Riemer voted in support of the
denial, and David Teeters abstained from
the vote. The remaining six Board mem-
bers voted to overturn the decision.

Not following the Allocations
process did not seem to satisfy the Board
as a justification for denying the request.

“We are very much aware of the
rules and regulations set by the
Allocations committee,” said Marquette
Bowman.

That being the case, some question
why SGB broke the Allocations rules.

“I believe my comment was misun-
derstood,” Bowman later said. “[The
rules] are understood in general. This is a
timeliness issue, really. We were getting
caught up in preparing the ceremony and
no one paid attention.”

When Riemer was asked why he
voted against the Board, he said, “I voted
to go with Allocations’ decision because
I saw the letter before it was sent out and
felt responsible for the technicality.”

The technicality is over the wording
of the announcements, according to
Bowman.

“The wording of the proposal is
what caused problems. Phrasing the cer-
emony as a ‘dinner’ is the technicality,”
said Bowman. “If we had just called it a
‘ceremony,’ we could have advertised it.
Then, once the money was approved, we
could have provided the dinner.”

When asked why SGB overruled
Campagna’s decision, SGB President
Justin DalMolin said, “We overruled the
committee’s decision because we wanted
another chance to fix this problem. We
would have fixed it sooner, but she did-
n’t come to us with the problem until it
was too late.”

Now the request will be resubmitted.
If the Allocations committee denies this

 

 

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE I

request, the SGB can vote to overrule the
decision again, and grant themselves the
money regardless of opposition.

Neither DalMolin, Riemer,
Bowman, or Ryan Wiedenrniller would
comment about whether they would take
the money.

“This is about recognizing students,”

' DalMolin said. “If we don’t get the

money, then we will just hold a ceremo-
ny honoring them. The issue isn’t
whether or not they eat.”

But he still would not comment on
whether the Board would accept another
refusal of the dinner request.

Because of the disagreement over
what he called “technicalities,”
DalMolin said that he and Campagna are
working to make the process clear for the
Board and the committee.

“On Thursday night, Campagna and
I had a ﬁve—hour meeting where this
issue was discussed extensively,”
DalMolin said. ‘

The product of this meeting was a
memo entitled “SGB and the Allocations
Committee — One Team, Two Jobs.”

The plan is to “increase communica-
tion between the president of SGB and
the Allocations chair by having sched-
uled times to discuss any questions, con-
cerns, or viewpoints so they may be pre-
sented to the Board in a clear fashion that
facilitates reaching a well—informed deci-
sion.”

The memo also recommends that a
Board member should consult the
Allocations Chair when initiating a new
program. The submitter of any requests
and the Allocations chair, if necessary,
will set up a time to make the request
clear to the Allocations Committee.

The memo also states that the
Allocations chair is responsible for pre-
senting Allocations’ decisions to the
Board, and “the chair is responsible for
contributing to discussion in a manner
that clarifies the Allocations
Committee’s viewpoints and perspec-
tive.”

“This document won’t make it all
peachy, but we hope it will prevent any
more problems for the incoming chair.
Situations need to be handled so there is
no room for interpretation,” said
DalMolin.

lars on the medical malpractice insurance.
Savings for [the other insurance companies]
are much more modest because they are
newer.”

He said the money is used to improve
“other University initiatives.” This included
attracting more well-known professors and

‘ improving academic programs. -

Ihesysrem

Captive insurance is one of three insur-

ance options Pitt exercises. Some of Pitt is
self-insured, meaning the University simply

pays for claims out of its pocket as each .

claim is ﬁled. Ramicone calls it “pay— -

' you-go” insurance.

Pitt is also commercially insured, which
means an insurance company independent
of Pitt handles other insurance claims. For
example, ﬁre insurance for the Cathedral of
Leaming is handled by a commercial insur-
ance company. Ramicone explained that the
insurance for such an expensive building is
more than Pitt wants to handle on its own.

With the captive insurance program,
Pitt set up ﬁve, insurance companies that
handle the remainder of Pitt insurance. They
are: Forbes, Tri-Century, Panther, Cathedral,
and Freedom. These companies enable Pitt
to insure itself through restricted trusts
which pay for ﬁnancial losses. 1'

The companies are separate and act as
banks for Pitt’s premium. Each company
requires Pitt to cut a check for itself. The
money is then invested in a restricted trust
fund, where it is available to pay claims

against Pitt.

If there are no
claims, the interest
made from the
investment is then
used to lower the
following year’s
premium for _ the
insurance compa-

nies’ carriers.
Jane W.
Thompson, the

executive director
of Administration
Environmental
Health & Safety
Risk Management,
said the interest
made from the investments is one way the
University is able to offer lower premiums
than their competitors.

According to J .H. Watters’ 1986 thesis
on risk management, captive insurance
enables institutions like Pitt to keep premi-
um dollars within the institution and also to
gain income from the investments of its dol-
lars. Hence, Pitt is helping itself by keeping
the money in-house.

“VVrth commercial insurance, if no
claims are made, the money is lost,”
Ramicone said.

The controversial island trip is funded
by one of Pitt’s captive medical malpractice
insurance companies. Ramicone said the
undergraduate program or 'any programs
outside of the medical faculty are unaﬁected

  
  

 

 by the premium

ical malpractice

  

 University of
Pittsburgh Medical Cente .

“[The cost of] our medical malpractice
insurance is signiﬁcantly lower than what
we would be paying in the outside arena,”
Ramicone said

Medical malpractice insurance is only
one of three parts of the captive insurance
program The other two are general liability
insurance and directors’ and oﬂicers’ insur-
ance. The latter two are funded by student
tuitionand state appropriations.

A symbiosis

Some oﬂicials say oifshore insurance
companies are not uncommon in the busi-
ness world, and add that over the years,
many companies have opted to become
their own insurance companies in the wake

of insurance crises. .
Pitt Law School professor Douglas
Branson said many organizations are drawn
to the paradise islands because of favorable
regulations on insurance. 1 i
Ramicone agreed, saying attractiv
banking and tax laws were ways the islands
generated money to supplement their tourist
industry. 5
Pitt made the decision to structure its
ﬁrst insurance company after the 
model in 1976, during a period of instability
for medical malpractice insurance. ‘
According to Watters, the early 1970s
were high—pressure times for medical practi-
tioners. Financial losses for institutions like
Pitt were common, as more people attrib-
uted mishaps to negligent conduct by their
physicians. A greater willingness on the
public’s part to sue doctors became appar-
ent, and the insurance industry retaliated by
increasing rates. _ .
Pitt’s medical faculty was subject to sig-
niﬁcant ﬁnancial losses as rates climbed and
malpractice cases increased. Ramicone said
this crisis forced Pitt to consider other
options, one of which was oﬂ°shore captive
Whether the trips to the Grand
Caymans are necessary will continue to be
controversial. As Thompson said, the
islands aren’t ugly in February, but there is
work involved. .
“It’s a nice trip. Does it have a business
purpose, and is it required? Yes and yes,”
Ramicone said.

eration of workers be convinced to relocate and/or stay in
Pittsburgh?

Transportation to, from, and within Pittsburgh needs to be
made easier and more accessible.

Pittsburgh used to be the gateway to the West. It can be again.

This city has a major international airport. There needs to be
better transportation to draw people to and from the airport. The
subway should connect to the airport. If a traveller has a three-hour
layover at the airport, he should be able to hop on the subway,
come into the city, and pump some money into the restaurants and
stores here, rather than at the airport.

 The problem with the buses that rm to the airport is that they
don’t run frequently, nor quickly, enough for someone stuck at the
airport for a limited amount of time to make a jaunt into the city.
Therefore, the precious tourist dollars that the airport could draw
into the city are wasted.

C High speed rails that go to major cities like New York,
Chicago, and Cleveland would draw people and money into
Pittsburgh as well, especially if these rails went through the city
rather than outside of it like the airport.

VV1thin the city, public transportation should be improved to
provide greater mobility to the different sections of Pittsburgh. The
Spineline project was to extend the subway system to Oakland, the
Northside, and the Southside. It was unceremoniously dropped
from the planning’ board. It’s time to get back on track with extend-
ing the subway system. If Pittsburgh is to grow, the ways to get
around in it must grow as well.

Improved transportation won’t solve all of the problems that
face Pittsburgh, but it would bring money into the city and improve
the quality of life for residents. The money could be used to solve
problems such as unfavorable tax and economic conditions.
Pittsburgh needs to start moving in the right direction. Improving
transportation is one way to get there. ‘

Undergrads:

 

Students at this University, at
least the undergraduates, just aren’t
willingtostandupandtakepartin
a debate about what our school’s
priorities should be.

Everyone here knows it,
which is why groups like the
Student Government Board, the
Black Action Society, and the
Campus Women’s Organization,
despite their sometimes valiant
attempts, will never have any sig-
niﬁcant inﬂuence over policy.

Unless, sometime in the very
near future, you decide to put down
the Iron City and pick up the phone.
But before you do that, you need to
be informed

The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, the biggest school in this
University, is considering eliminat-
ing some of its graduate programs,
meaning that those programs may
not exist anymore. Or they may

reduce some programs so signiﬁ-
cantly that it amounts to almost the

same thing.Allinall, 10 programs

are staring into a crystal ball, trying
to guess their futures.

Graduate students argue that if
this happens, undergraduate educa-
tion is going to be hurt in a big way.
There won’t be teaching assistants
in those departments, which,
according to grad students, could
mean that in order to keep up with
their research, professors will have
to take on bigger classes. In time,
high—quality professors may not
even want to teach here because
they could interact with a wider
variety of students at a school with
a graduate program, they say. Most
of the affected departments, to top it
off are in the humanities, so some
people think you can say goodbye
to that well-rounded, liberal arts
education you wanted —— instead,

sors and grad students. He looked
me dead in the eyes and said,
“That’s because undergraduates are
stupid.”

Yes, ladies and gents, stupid

‘ Personally, I just think that
most undergrads have trouble
focusing on a single issue without
getting distracted. For example, we
reported that grad students were
questioning Pitt’s priorities in the
light of an athletic debt topping $4
million. For about three days, all
anyone could talk about was that
debt. People were outraged. Then,
after the weekend, the undergradu-
ates found better things to talk
about. It was like it never hap-
pened

Now, I think that “student apa-
thy” is an overused phrase, but let’s
face it, folks, I’m probably the only
undergraduate who has spent more
than ﬁve minutes thinking about
what could happen if a graduate
program suddenly disappeared.

I don’t care what you think
about eliminating the German
Ph.D. program or reducing linguis-
tics until there’s next to nothing left.
I don’t care if you think a losing
football team is more important
than a classics department that may
be the most cost-effective program
in this University. I don’t want to
tell you what to think; I don’t see
that as my job. I don’t even really
want to tell you what I think.

I do, however, want you to
think.

When you’ve wondered to

yourself if it’s better to cut a small
program or to trim a large one,
move on to whether combining the
language departments, into one
massive conglomerate might lower
costs, and then wonder whether

Then pick up the phone. Justin
DalMolin and the SGB claim to be
here for the students. Make them
get oﬁf their keisters and do some-
thing that matters. If enough stu-
dents call and express their con-
cerns, whatever those may be, then
maybe they’ll think to write some-
thing to Dean Koehler about it.

Or better yet, skip the middle-
man. Koel1ler’s e-mail address is

done, the plan goes on to Provost‘

James Maher; write him at jvma-
her@vms.cis.pitt.edu. Before
administrators make another key
decision with essentially no under-
graduate input, speak up for a
change. The FAS Graduate Student
Organization got to speak with the
advisory committee because they
took the time“, to push for that

chance. The reason there is an advi- ‘

sory committee is that faculty did-
n’t want to be left out of this
process, and they fought for it.
Taking part in the debate is a
lot like being engaged by the mate-
rial in a class. If you like it, you
learn more. If you hate it, you chal-
lenge it. Once a graduate program

is closed, there is no guarantee that ’

it will ever be reopened.

Cesca Antonelli expects Peter

number of messages hes getting

Boeheim, the
Bubble, and
The Big Dance

  

    

Is there anybody anywhere on the
planet who doesn’t love the NCAA bas-
ketball tournament? College basketball
fans have to love it. The sheer volume
of basketball on network television last
weekend was probably almost illegal.
It’s a couch potato’s dream come true.

The major rap on the tournament
comes from Crybaby coaches like
Syracuse’s Jim Boeheim and West
Virginia’s Gale Catlett, who whine
because their teams didn’t get the privi-
lege of being trounced in the first round
of the tournament. Boeheim wanted to
use the NIT to prove that his team was
good enough for the Big Dance. The
Orangemen lost in the first round.

There are arguments every year
about who belongs in the tournament

and who doesn’t. That’s part of the fun

of the game, unless you’re one of the
bubble teams like West Virginia or
Syracuse who gets passed over in favor
of some team from the most overrated
basketball conference in the land, the
Big Ten. The fact of the matter is that
none of those bubble teams, from the
Big Ten or otherwise, have much of a
chance to win more than one game.

So why do coaches care so much
about whether they get in? Because this
tournament is something special. With a
nickname like the Big Dance, it has to
be. ‘

The NCAA’s basketball playoff
system is the best postseason system
around. It’s played at over a dozen sites,
often with up to four games going on
simultaneously, all weekend long. It’s
enough to make your head spin. They
don’t call it “March Madness” for noth-
in .
g With 64 teams, it’s automatically a
huge event. Yet, as Boeheim and Catlett
would argue, it’s never big enough. It

Pitt baseball heats up

over Spring Break

Steve Stonaha

 

Hopes are high this
year for the Pitt baseball
team after a successful trip
to Florida over spring
break.

Pitt played 12 games
in nine days against teams
from all over the country
and came away with nine
wins and three losses.
They started the trip off
with a 11-8 win over
Fairmont State. The Pitt
squad was able to over-
come six errors by pound-
ing out 12 hits to get
Kevin Lazeski the first win
for this year’s Pitt team.

On March 2, the
Panthers split a double-
header. Pitt opened the day
with a 10-0 drubbing of
Monmouth University in a
contest stopped after five
innings due to the 10-run
mercy rule. John Schultz
pitched a two-hitter as Pitt
just out—manned . the
Fighting Scots. Later that

as well, losing a tough 6-4

Pitt outhit Valparaiso, 7-5,
but couldn’t put the runs

loss of the season for the
team.

Pitt continued the next

day against a powerful»

Florida Atlantic team,
which came out and
pounded Pitt pitching for
14 runs on 16 hits as Pitt
fell 14-2. Chris Gallick
lost as Pitt’s record was

Pitt then had a rematch
with Valparaiso and got
their revenge as they
downed Valpo, ll-10.
They were able to win in
spite of five errors by belt-
ing out 15 hits and holding
the Crusaders to eight

enough to earn the win and
up his record to 2-0.

Two wins and 38 goals for
rampaging Piti lacrosse team

 

The theme of the Pitt men’s
lacrosse team this season has been to
play solid defense and capitalize on
opponents’ mistakes.

Their past two games have been no
different. While they’ve still relied on
defense and solid goaltending to win
games, this time the Panther’s- offense
has been the main point of the story.
They exploded for 38 goals in two
games to raise their record to 4-1 over-
all. a

They dismantled Allegheny
College 18-1 on Feb. 27, and crushed
cross-town rival Duquesne, 20-3, this
past Friday night.

“They were pretty easy games,”
senior goaltender Dave Travis said.
“The Allegheny game was kind of a
joke, and Duquesne is a first—year team.
But Duquesne gave us an early scare,
though. In the ﬁrst half, our offense was
lousy, but we pulled it together and
started to click in the second half.”

The Panthers were led by freshman
Dave Corrado, who scored ﬁve goals
against Duquesne. His stepping up was
big for the team, because senior co-cap-
tain Rob Heapes could not attend the
game due to the birth of his son.

“Dave was sweet,” Travis said. “He
stepped it up when the team needed him
to.”

Despite the two blowout wins,
sophomore midfielder Stephen Love
said he feels the team has not reached
its potential. ‘

“We had a bad game against

- Duquesne, if you believe that,” Love

said. “We were slacking off in the first

half and as a result we were losing 2-0.
We thought we would come out and
crush this team, but they came out and
punched us in the face. We were miss-
ing passes and loose balls, but we
pulled it together for the win.”

The.Panthers now look toward the
playoffs, but they have several tough
opponents remaining in their way,
including an experienced Grove City
squad on Tuesday night at Pitt Stadium.

“Grove City is the biggest game of
the season,” Travis said. “If we win that
game, we’re in the playoffs with a
home game. If we lose, we can still pos-
sibly make the playoffs if we win the
rest of our games and catch a couple of
breaks. That game would be on the road
and during ﬁnals week. That would be
tough. We want a home game, and we
are fired up and ready for Grove City.”

Love agreed with Travis, saying
that the matchup with the Wolverines is
the most important game of the season.

“We’re pumped up,” he said. “This
is the toughest game of the year. We
need to win, and Grove City is the team
to beat.”

Travis said that Pitt has already
seen Grove City play this season, and
he feels they have a chance to win.

“We have a scouting report on
them, and they are a good transition
team,” Travis said. “If we stop them in
transition, we have a good shot at win-
ning.”

After the Wolverines, the Panthers
make the short trip to Carnegie Mellon
for a Thursday ‘night contest. Pitt has
one ﬁnal home matchup on Saturday in
preparation for the Seventh Annual
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout, begin-
ning April 4.

 

Column  _  .,  ..

may sound like a lot of teams, but the 64
in the tournament represent only about
20 percent of the nation’s Division I
teams. That’s a lower percentage than
any other major league sport in
America. And it’s exactly the way it
should be.

Any kind of setup that can make
otherwise sane people voluntarily sit
down and watch a game between North
Carolina and some team like Southwest
Wyoming Tech from the Midwestern
Mountain Valley Conference is nothing
short of miraculous. The really great
thing is that more often than not, that
matchup turns out to be a real game.

When a powerhouse team like
South Carolina plays a team like Coppin
State, the outcome is not supposed to be
in question. Goofy things happen in this
tournament, and that makes it truly

great. Unless you’re one of the poor
peanutheads who picked South Carolina
to go to the Final Four in your office
pool (for entertainment purposes only),
how can you not enjoy seeing that kind
of upset in the first round? Every single
year, that happens to some_ unsuspecting
third or fourth seed.

Speaking of those pools, they’re
one more great thing about this touma—
ment. People who wouldn’t be able to
tell Rick Pitino from Ricky Ricardo get
in on these pools. I know this because
they’re all beating me right now. I don’t
care, though, because I’ve been having
too much fun watching the all the mad-
ness.

Geoﬁ Moak is a columnist for The Pitt
News and is not ashamed to admit he
picked Xavier to go to the Final Four.

“They were about as good as it
gets,” said Davis. “She was one of
the best players I’ve played all
yean”

Shalbrack, Hoffman, and Gang
all fell victim to the Eagles in sin-
gles’ play. Gang was the only
Panther besides Kalesnik to take
more than one game in her match,
dropping a 6-1, 6-1 decision to
Agnieszka Niemczuk.

The Panthers dropped the dou-
bles matches as well, with the clos-
est matchup coming in the third—seed
contest. Pitt’s Jen Bible teamed with
Hoffman to challenge Eastern
Michigan’s Brenda Walli and

 

five hits to earn the win in Pitt’s 6-1
victory.

William Patterson University,
Pitt’s next opponent, proved more
difficult. Due to some unfortunate
errors, Pitt fell 6-5. Rob Schaffer
received his first loss of the season in
this game.

Pitt closed out the road trip with
a five-game winning streak, starting
with Lazeski’s two-hit shutout
against Allentown College. Pitt
ended up the victors, 4-0.

Even though Pitt was outhit 10-8,
they came away with a relatively
easy win against the St. Bonaventure
Bonnies, 10-3. Schultz came away
with another win to bring him up to
3-0 in the young season.

Pitt got two more wins on March
8 with a 6-5 win over Textile and a 7-
4 contest against St. Joseph’s
University. Jeff Sofran threw two-
and-two-thirds scoreless innings
against Textile to earn his first win of
the season. Gallick evened his record
at 1-1 by earning the decision against
St. Joe’s.

Pitt closed out the road trip on
March 9 with another game against
St. Joe’s. Coughenour stopped the
Hawks’ attempt at revenge to earn his
second win this year. Pitt won 10-7.

Pitt came home to face Duquesne
on Thursday. Errors devastated the
Panthers, as the Dukes scored 14 runs
on 10 hits and benefitted from the
five Pitt errors. Lazeski got his first
loss of the season and dropped to 2-1.

A weekend home stand featuring
a matchup against Davis & Elkins
and a doubleheader against Gannon
was cancelled due to rain. Next up
for Pitt is an away rematch with
Duquesne at 2 p.m. Tuesday. The
Panthers hope to begin their home
and Big East schedules this weekend
with a three-game series against
Connecticut.

 

Daulena Khaw, l_osing a tough 8-6
contest.

“My team learned a lot after a
loss like this,” said Dieffenbach.
“You can learn a lot through imita-
tron.”

While Pitt was overmatched by
Eastern Michigan, the team mem-
bers feel that the match can only
help them in the future.

“This is the type of team we’ll
see down the road. They’l1 toughen
us up,” Dieffenbach said. The coach
said future competition against Big
East schools will be just as fierce.

you compare numerous apartments, check out the reputations of the landlords, and talk to the existing tenants

when the landlord is not there. To start you off on the “right" track, call our number (24 hours) and leave your

BICYCLE LOCKERS FOR RENT

Pitt,Ridesharing has made individual bicycle lockers available for

Towers, and outside of Forbes Quadrangle on the patio side. The
lockers are made of steel and totally enclose the bicycle. There is
also room for your helmet, riding shoes, etc. When you close the
door, the lock recesses into the handle, making the locker very safe
and secure, and keeping your bicycle protected from the elements.
