Pitt Union Program Council
chairwoman Tammy Haddad and
P chairman Marc. Holloway Black
Action Society debated a variety of
subjects concerning the status of
the program council at yesterday's
’ Student lGovernm'ent Board as-

sembly meeting.
The special meeting of the
assembly, which normally meets
only once‘ a term, was called three
weeks ago by motion of the
members to discuss the guidelines
of the program council. The first
meeting was prior to the con-
‘troversy surrounding the Chuck
Mangione Homecoming concert,
 the promotion -of which violated

- University regulations.

In, early discussion Holloway

directed "a question to Haddad"

concerning her function in the
program council. Haddad then read
her assigned duties froma list 0
council guidelines. - l

  White House C”onsidersPosvar forCivil Defense Position

..Chancellor Posvar is being.

considered by the Carter admin-'

istration ‘to head a new federal

agency responsible for coordinating

‘civil defense and disaster relief
V“ programs. A

The new agency, the Federal
Emergency, Management Admin-
istration, has been ‘approved by
congress as part of a reorganization
plan submitted by President—Carter.

Posvar, in St. Louis on business
last night, relayed a statement to
Vice-Chancellor for Public Affairs
Bernard Kobosky indicating that he
had not been offered the ‘position

should know by now, and if you
don’t, Ithink. it’s' time "to. step back

and take a look at your position.” A

Haddad answered that to clarify
the point for everyone at the
meeting,; she thought it would be
better to read the description of her
position from the original‘ guide-
lines. '

Holloway next ‘asked Haddad

how she was unaware that the 1
Mangione concert was promoted by"
students‘ instead of professionally?

promoted, as the program council
contract required.

“Ithink ‘you are incompetent to
say you don’t ‘know where $7,500 of
a $110,000 allocation of student

money went. It seems as though“

you don’t know ‘and don’t care
where money in your organization
is going,” Holloway accused.
Haddad responded {by saying
Holloway doesn’t understand the
hierarchy of the program council.

yet and was satisﬁed with his work
at:Pitt. -l A _ ~ '

‘ ‘I have not been offered and ‘I do
not seek any federal position,” the
statements‘ reads. “I. have learned
of the possibility of my consider-
ation as head of thenew ‘Federal

Emergency Management 'Agency ’

through friends and from my role as
a past advisor to a predecessor
agency concerned with. national‘
emergency 'planning."’

“I am fully satisﬁed where I am
and committed to my present
position at the University. Whether
Iwould consider an appointment as

chairwoman claimed, andin the
case of the Mangione ‘concert, only
council adviser Jack Brown and
music committee chairman Steve
Vance handled arrangements‘ for
the concert.--

Holloway continued his assault
on Haddad by saying "the program
council failed to offer the Black
Action Society a concert for Black

Week. Holloway ‘said This group’s'

requests for permission to produce
its own concert were denied.
Haddad maintains that

concert, but the Black Action

. Society refused them all. Holloway 

said no offer was made."

point into a match of charges and
counter-charges between members
of the Housing Task Force, a group
of residents who have collected .1900
signatures on petitions asking for a
new vote, and board members. Task
force spokesmen argued that board
members had been lax in their

representation of students when the

assignment system was developed
while board members defended the
board’s past actions.-Steve Bair,
secretary of the Bruce Hall
Dormitory Council said the _main
issue involved in the controversy is

that students feel they were not

represented adequately when the
assignment system was designed.
He denied that the issue was
whether students wanted to use the

V old assignment procedures. I:

_ “That’s not what is at issue here’,
(whether or not people want the old
system),” said Bair. “What’s at
issueis that we _want "a vote of the
general resident body. People are
up in arms and something has to be

done about it.”

John Rosick, chairman of the
residence board, argued that his
predecessor Phil Cillo had attended
the meetings where the lottery
system was developed. He said
Cillo represented residents adequ-

ately at the meetings.

“Cillo should have been able to

think for the whole student body,’f '

Roscick said. “He was chairman of
the RSA. He had the right to speak
for all (residents).”

Fred Fonseca, director of the
Office of Residence Life, also

student representation during the
meetings on the lottery system,

Fendler said.
Keith Wassum, area coordinator

for the Schenley Quadrangle, said
-_ that it was unimportant to argue

"now about whether there had been

enough representation. He said that,

the implications of a vote must be
considered. “If you are going to
have a referendum, you have to talk

about the implications and con-

sequences of that referendum”
Wassum said. “You have to be
talking about people camping on the
Cathedral Lawn a day or two. or a
week in advance (of room assign-
ment).”

Wassum said also that if the vote
on the lottery created an unwork-
able system, the discussion at the

V meeting was useless. ‘ ‘If you return

to a position where you have a
system that can't work, all this
effort and conversation is a waste of
time,” he said.

Wassum listed a number of
issues that had to be addressed if
there was some alternative to the
new lottery system developed. He
said any other procedure must
consider how lines would be
controlled and how people “camp-
ing” two days before assignment
started would be handled.

the Office of Residence Life,
presented ﬁguies to try to show that

«Holloway added an amendment,

in the 1977 - 1978 _school year 12
percent of residents were seniors.
they also showed that the resident
population had been 21 percent
juniors, 29 pecent sophomores and
37 percent freshmen.

The 1978-1979 figures, which
contained no data from Litchﬁeld

that the resident population this
year was 12 percent seniors, 21

the number of reserved spaces for

students and resident assistants in
each class.

The ﬁgures explained by Snyder
showed that 306 spaces would be
allocated to seniors under the
lottery system if they were allowed
10 percent of 1,936_available rooms.
He then added a total of 239
reserved rooms that would be given
to students to reach the ﬁnal total
that equaled 13 percent of the
resident population. Snyder ex-
plained that the projected percent-
ages for juniors and sophomores
were reached by the same method.

Snyder said that one weakness of
the figures was that the data for
1978-1979 did not contain

information from Tower A or

that the large number of freshmen

Students Lobby in Harrisburg for Marijuana Reform Bill

By MARGI STUMPF

Pitt News Staff Writer

HARRISBURG—The Public
and Governmental Relations Com-

I mittee of the Student Government

Board lobbied here Monday to urge
60 undecided House represent-
atives to support a bill that calls for
decriminalization of marijuana.

Senate Bill 1425, which calls for
increased penalties on possession,
manufacture and distribution of
phencyclide (angel dust), was
amended by Rep. Joseph Rhodes,
D-East End, to reclassifymarijuana
also from a criminal to a summary
offense, according to committee
chairman Todd C. Park.

The bill as amended has caused a

@.three-way split among represent-

atives, Park said.

‘The yea/nay vote on the bill is
split almost equally, Park stated,
with 60 undecided representatives
the object of the committee’s efforts
to push for passage of the bill.

University of Pennsylvania and
Bloomsburg State College chapter
representatives of the National
Organization for the Reform. of
Marijuana Laws, and. NORML
statewide coordinators William
Cluck and Rev. William B. Deane
Jr. met with Pitt’s student lobbying
committee at the Capitol Building.
They then launched a blitz to sway
those 60 representatives to vote yes

6 on the bill, which will be considered

by the House sometime thisjweek.

According to Deane, most
representatives have antiquated
viewpoints on the use of marijuana.

“They’re still operating on 19305
myths. Sex and dirty pusher
myths,” Deane said. “The fact is,
we’re all pushers, friend to
friends.”

Pennsylvania State University
NORML president Steve Alter
concurred with Deane’s remarks.

“They have a preconception of

marijuana as being a corrupting
force," he said.

“The only feedback represent-
atives get from constituents has
been from church groups. lt’s all
been negative,” Alter added,
noting lobby efforts are made to
present the positive side of
decriminalization. He cited the
lowering of fines for possession
from a maximum $500 to $100,
elimination of a possible 30 day
imprisonment and the end of an
automatic criminal record for those
caught by authorities with the drug
as some positive points of
decriminalization.

A secretary for one of the
representatives, however, doubted
the effectiveness ‘of pro-decriminal-
ization lobbyists. “Last year
someone came in here with
marijuana pins on and marijuana
belts, and the representative wasn’t
too happy. The lobbyists had the
wrong attitude and looked like
hippies,” she said.

Rep. Roger F. Duffy, D-Alleg-
heny, emphatically denounced the
bill ‘when meeting with lobbyist
Diane Behers.

“I’m not going to vote for it, and
that’s it. I don’t have to give any
reason. I’ve seen the effects
(marijuana) has on young people. I
have six children myself,” he
stated.

Duffy added, “I don’t think
you’re going to convince anyone
around here (to suppport the

bill).” F

Rep. George Pott, ‘R-Allegheny,
also was against the bill.

“I’m afraid decriminalization
would lead to increased usage. This
means more sales and more dollars

for organized crime,”Pott said. .

“Organized crime was started with
prohibition. It’s an untenable
situation we have.

“I think we’re going to have a
crime-ﬁghter governor,” he con-
tinued. “I'm not about to vote for
any signiﬁcant stand that will
saddle the new governor with
this.“

Pott said he did not receive any
indication from his constituents to
warrant his yea vote, but that
people from NORML are _running
around here all the time.

“I see no good reason for me to
vote for this bill this week. My job is
to protect the people of Pennsyl-
vania,” Pott said.

Several lobbyists reported rep-
resentatives were not informed at
all about the bill.

Lobbyist Josie Gagliardi said

Rep. Joseph P. Kolter, D-Beaver, '

would support the bill although he
said he did not know much about it.

Rep. Charles Caputo, D-South

2%
r

Hius, was reported by Befters as

saying he hadn’t seen the bill"

before, and made copies of the
committee’s fact sheets for refer-
ence. He was also concerned, said
Behers, about what the passage of
the bill would mean in terms of
penalties for second and third
offenders.

Lobbyist Bill Jackson stated
Rep. C.L. Schmidt, D-Armstrong,
“wasn’t informed about it, but
receptive.’ ’

Those representatives against the
bill were concerned with the lack of
constituent report on it, the
continuing debate over the effects
marijuana has on users and moral
considerations ‘of usage.

Rep. William Mackowski, R-

Cambria, said the bill was morally
and ethically wrong, according to
lobbyist Martin Bertocchi.

;c'/2;»

Lobbyist Jeff Couch said Rep.
Marvin Miller. R-Lancaster. who
introduced a similiar bill to the
House back in the early 1970s,
would vote yes if there were a tie on
the bill, but would otherwise refrain
from addressing the issue. Couch

- said Miller indicated he thought the

bill did not have enough support to
pass.

After all lobbyists had reported
back to Park, he evaluated the effort
and gave the bill a 50/50 chance of
passing.

“I’d venture to say, of the people
we counted as saying no, some of
them now say maybe. Out of 60
undecided representatives, we got
at least twenty to say yes. With the
80 projected by NORML as
supporting the bill (before Mon-
day’s trip) that puts it (the bill)
within two of passing.”

Government Relations Committee members leave the Capitol building after buttonholln undecided representatives to
urge them to support decriminalization of marijuana.

' By RODNEYB. GRIFFITH
Pitt Ncwsstaff Writer ‘
Historian and writer Lerone
Bennett warned a predominately
black crowd Wednesday that it faces
the worst threat to the drive for
equality in the United States since
slavery.

“Within ten years, this nation
will decide once and for all. It will
decide whether it will respond to the
demands of minorities by repres-
sion or liberalization,” Bennett said
in a speech to open Pitt's Black
Week.

He cited the increasing balance of

, payment deﬁcit, the decline of the

dollar, reverses in recent elections,
the Bakke case, the retreat of white
liberals and a wave of new
conservatism as factors’ that com-

 bined to hurt the steps toward
p,equality already achieved in the

Unived States.‘ ' .

Bennett warned that the con-
sertive threat that seemed aimed
toward black Americans endangers
all Americans, including women
and ethnic Americans. -

‘ ‘If they come for poor blacks and

.rich blacks today, you can bet your

last dollar they are coming for
women libbers -- black, brown, red
and white -- tomorrow morning’,'
Bennett said. “If they come for
women libbers tomorrow morning
they are coming for Jews and other
white ethnics tomorrow afternoon.
“How many more more Third
Reiches do we need before we
understand the question, before

- this action today is not a question of

race, but the question of the very
meaning and destiny of the United
States of America.”

Bennett said the major problems
facing blacks are “the paradox of
progressive retrogression,” the
effects of electronic media on blacks
and the collapse of the American
imperial system.

He explained that the paradox of
progressive retrogression was the
growing number of poor blacks and
the growing number of professional
and affluent blacks that is occuring
simultaneously in this countryu He
said figures show that the gap
between the median income of
blacks and whites was less than
$1,600 when he graduated from
college in 1949. Today, he said the

 Historian Warns of Equality Threat

gap was $6,285 and growing wider
monthly.

Bennett also attacked television
and its detrimental effects on all
people. He said television paciﬁes
blacks and makes them col-
laborators with the American
system.

“We live in a world where most
people, black and white, are sitting
like zombies -- like dope addicts -- in
front of black boxes, ” Bennett said.

Bennett advocated a struggle for
a social revolution in the United
States to overcome the problems of
black unemployment and a de-
caying economic system that he said
the United States faces.

“In the face of these challenges
our tasksare clear,” Bennett-said.
“The first task is to do something,
anything -- whatever’s, required --
about the black unemployment rate
and the deteriorating institutions in
black America.

‘ ‘The second task, growing out of
the ﬁrst, is the str_uggle for social
revolution in America. Nothing less
will prevent a horror too great to
contemplate. ’ ’

Lerone Bennett warned an audience in the S.U. Ballroom Monday that black

Americans must now face the w
ce slavery.

(Senate majority leader) Henry Messinger indicated
to us that maybe the state-related universities better
start tightening their belts.” ‘

Sen. Messinger, along with Sen. Wilmont E.
Fleming, chairman of the republican caucus, and
even Rep. Helen D. Wise, a strong supporter for
state-related schools, did seem to spread tales of
-gloom and despair to the student lobbyists. Their at-
titudewas: We don’t know what will become of
funds for state-related universities, but the situation
is not good. Don’t expect an increase.

Page 6—Wednesday, November 15, 1978

' “I’m not about to vote for any significant stand that“-

will saddle the new governor with this.”

Remarks by legislators ranged from Rep. Bill
Mackaski’s R-Cambria description of marijuana as
morally and ethically wrong to Rep. Walter Dever-
ter’s, R-Millflin, claim that the bill will have
detrimental effects on society as a whole.

Even with the negative speeches, an optimistic

A Student  

Voice in

Harrisburg

I

Last winter members of the Governmental and
Public Relations Committee. of the Student Gover-
nment Board travled to Harrisburg to lobby for in-
creased appropriations for Pitt.

The message from the legislators: not good.

. “The trends are not really favorable for us at this
point in time,” said the committee chairman_Mark
“I feel we are in a downward trend.

Last "summer legislators somehow managed to .

raise appropriations for state-related‘ schools, in-
cluding a 4 percent~increase- (amounting to $63.1
million) for Pitt. Although a variety of facets is
responsible for the change of heart in Harrisburg, the
student lobbyists throughout the state must take
some cr_edit, even if only miniscule. '
Students participating in the first Harrisburg lobby
for ‘this year’s. committee returned Monday, once
again frustrated over the wall of words with which

several legislators protected themselves and their .

districts. .
This time students lobbyed for passage of Senate

' Bill 1425, which calls for the reclassification of

marijuana usage from-a criminal to summary offen-
se, while increasing penalties on possesion, manufac-
ture and distribution of phenyclide (angel dust).

Although the vote among representatives is split
equally, according to committee chairman Todd‘
Park‘, students did. not get a very favorable response
from most of the legislators they visited.

“I’m not going to vote for it, and that’s it,” Rep.

Roger Duffy, D-Allegheny, told SGB mernber Diane
Behers. “I’ve seen the effects on young people.
I don’t think you’re going to convince anyone
around here (to support the bill .” _

"‘I’m afraid decriminalization would lead to in-

creased usage,” said Rep. George Pott, R-Allegheny. ,

. It has been proved in the past.that even though at‘

first stubborn-, many legislators can be swayed when -‘-i
a particular group makes a trip, “just to visit.” A

Many representatives could be like Rep. Joseph P.‘
Kolter, D-Beaver, who said he would support the
bill, even though he did not know much about it.

The committee could become a force, and not only
a voice of the SGB, but a voice for all Pitt students.
Legislators hadto be impressed with Pitt’s lobbylast

year, and they may stay impressed if the lobbying

continues.

1” U Students Left Out in Cold I4»/ithNewiDormli0ttery  P

Now you see it, now you don’t.
Kiss goodbye to the first come, first
serve basis and bring on the new

M lottery system, the University’s new

solution to the old dilemma of

_ housing.

Anyone who has been exposed to
a housing ‘contract, and probably
many who haven’t, realize the
extreme lack of dormitory space
here at Pitt. Of course, we need a

change in policy, one that will ’

alleviate the burden of overcrowd-
ing, but the lottery system simply
does not make it. Perhaps our

- present system is not the ultimate,’

but like our grading system, it's the
best we have. The ﬁnal solution is to
befound in the construction of ‘new

dorms, but for now we must deal
with what we have.

The new lottery system reflects
what could be called, at best, a
hasty, irresponsible decision. Ac-
cording to The Pitt News and the
various bulletins posted on campus,
the lottery is law—'—nominated,
voted and accepted. but voted on by
whom? The apparent groundwork‘
for the program was laid last spring
and finalized during the summer
months when student input was
almost nil. The students, however,
are the people who are sure to be

.affected the most. But we were

never consulted as a whole. We just
received an early Christmas
present. ‘

Two sources claim the University
consulted between three and ten
other institutions to receive assis-

tance that was instrumental in its‘

ﬁnal course of action. We were left
in the dark, unaware of our
situation. '

Don Hughes, ‘director, of the

Housing Office’ and Fred Fonseca, A

director of the Office of Residence
Life, were supposedly in charge of
the publicity surrounding the
lottery, but none appeared. These
directors state that the “upper level
administration” has finalized the

[program and that, according to
Fonseca, “there was no ‘guarantee

that there would be any change in
the process now.”

?

   
 

""" .\
~\\§iiii\\\‘\ ill ms;

l

Fonseca also adds, “It was pretty
much agreed that the old procedure
was a bad procedure bythe three
groups (Resident Student Associa-
tion, Office of Residence Life an

\

the Housing Office). 7 L .

So what" is “.pretty much” and
what" is “bad”? How do our
administration and officials account
for the sudden transition? Surely
they can not justify their decision by

4“'pretty much agreed...old proce- A
dure was a bad procedure,” nor can
they claim the move to be in the
students’ best interest. -We, as
adults, accept and demand our
responsibility. It is our right to be
contacted and conferred with on a.
matterof such significance.

Under this new system, the most.
inﬂuential and representative sub-
stituent of the student body is going
to be hurt the _most—the seniors.
Four years of experience and'__
learning, qualities that enhance the
University and aid the underclass-
men, will no longer reside on
campus. Seniority has gone out the
window and chance has ﬂown in.
September of 1979 will boast a mere
10 percent in resident seniors.

And who will compose this
minute proportion? If you are an
athlete, chancellor’s scholar, Univ-

ersity scholar or receive aid
requiring you to live here, you have
it made. But what right do these
people have over the rest of us?
Athletes are talented people and
Pitt would lack a balanced program
without them, but this does not
increase their value or their
privileges. Scholars are also a
valuable asset, but all students

(deserve the same right to learn and

stating the present procedure to be — we equa 'y '

Presently thereiare 4,111 spaces ‘
open for dormitory housing. Fifteeri -5
hundred of these will be utilized by
incoming freshmen. Twenty-two
hundred are reserved ‘for ‘upper-
classmen, but sophomores, juniors '
and seniors will unequally share.
Relocated students from branch
campuses will occupy the same dorm
roomsthat we were denied, even
though we have attended. the
Oakland campus since our first
year. ’ O ‘

Clearly, ‘we are heading down a
one-way street with a dead end to
greet us. Theadministration has the
power to reconsider and revise?
however. We, as students, did not
create this problem; but how about
asking us to help solve it?

Any corporation worth its salt today is a firm believer in the
theory of built-in obsolesence. Roughly, this theory goes as
follows: Never make anything this year that can't be revised,
remodelled, improved or strengthened next year.

A pioneer in the practical application of this theory has
been the fashion industry.

In this issue, Fifth Ave has a series of fashion photos.
Some portray what is called today's collegiate look, and some
are candid shots of what men and women really wear on
campus. Can you tell the.difference? See page 6.

Angels Ellis and Jim Lewis discourse on the freaks and
follies of fashion ‘(page 8) while Terry Vogt gives fashion tips
for those who have problem figures (page 7).

For followers of fashion, Jody Berg gives some ideas on
where to shop cheaply and still dress stylishly. See page 4-

Cosmetics, or "beauty aids" as they are euphemistically
called, are not ignored. On page 7_, Johnette Howard and

Honored in ItoIionRoom

By MARY JANE MCKEEVER

There are two He/ens: one Holy and

the other lovely, A third in character It

and beauty both resemble.-

Elena Lucretia Cornaro Piscopia is
the subject of the mural adorning the
rear wall of the Italian Classroom.
The mural was commissioned by the
women of the Italian Room Commit-
tee and was painted by Giovanni
Romagnoli, one of the foremost
Italian portrait painters in the 1940 s
and 1950 s. '

‘The mural’s subject was born on

June 5, 1646, to Gianbattista and
Zanetta Cornaro-Piscopia. The en-
nobled-House of Cornaro was a
wealthy one with’a distinguished
lineage. Between the 13th and 17th
centuries, the House gave four

' doges to the Venetian Republic,

threepopes and eight cardinals to the
Roman Catholic Church, many
statesmen to Italy and Queen
Catherina Cornaro to the Island‘ of
Cyprus.

'Elena’s father, Gianbattista, who
held the post of the Procurator of San
»Marco, was devoted to his four
children, and provided them all with a
good education.

Gianbattista strove to better the
family fortunes, though his, four
children were producing no heirs to
the family wealth. In a letter written
about 1672, Elena attempted to

and the diligent care of the '
physicians, I feel much stronger; l

therefore, I hope that in the future I

may resume my studies /and thus_

rescue the name of our House from
extinction and oblivion.’’ ,

Elena, in fragile health all her life,
was_ a child prodigy. _At seven, she
had shown remarkable reasoning
powers, an amazing memory and. a
modest character. She was tutored
in grammar, music, Latin, Greekand
mathematics. She also was an ac-
complished singer and composer. By
the age of 1 7; she had mastered the
harpsichord, clavichord, harp and
violin. « '

A professor at the University of
Pisa, Carlo Rinardini, said of Elena at
the time: “She is as beautiful as an
angel, and speaks Greek, Latin,
French, English and Spanish, with
perfect ease.”

Theology was Elena's favorite
subject. To aid her’ in these studies,
she. learned Hebrew, Arabic, and
Chaldaic. ,

pay their respect to the Pope; so in
her day great men who visited Padua

By JODY BERG

Clothes and accessories have
always been, like it or not, a major
part of life for many women. Another
majorpart of life, unfortunately, has
always been that fatal disease
‘,‘lackofunds." While some women

' resort to tin cups and street corners,
and other women resort to last year's
fashions, there is a better way. Pit-
tsburgh is full of hidden bargains and
dollar-stretchers for the looking, if not
the buying. ’

Thewearhouse (which is not a
warehouse, as its name implies) is

.a small boutique on Murray Avenue in

1' Squirrel Hill that carries designer
A labels such as Elliot Lauren, Sassoon,

Kenmar’ and William Kasper.
Although it looks and sounds\expen-
sive, all merchandise is 20 percent
off unless otherwise marked. Stock
includes sweaters, blouses, dresses,
suits, pants, shirts, a_ few accessories
and a _few coats. The selection is
small and rare. Wearhouse mer-
chandise likely could not be found in
a large department store for these
prices. .
‘Leftover Corner in Shadyside also
g has .a small selection, but its prices
make a visit there worthwhile. All or
most of the merchandise is on sale
now. ,Woole1_1_ cowl neck sweaters
can be had for $9.99, and wool skirts

A Saintly Scholar Triumphs 

In Renaissance Italy

(Continued from page 3)

Elena that it was only at her father’s
insist nce that she sought degrees
from the University. .
Elena prepared to submit to the
difficult task of defending her

' theological thesis, and to take an oral

examination in order to become a
Doctor of Philisophy. However, “no
university had ever conferred the
Doctor of Theology on a woman, and
the Studium of Padua was not going
to disregard so venerable a tradition,"
according to Fusco. Elena’s father
then appealed to Cardinal Gregorio

Barbargio (1625-1.697) (now Saint

Gregorio. Barbargi.o),Bishop of Padua
and Chancellor of the Theological
Faculty of the University. “What? A

female doctor and" teacher of ”

theology? Never!” Fusco said the
cardinal replied. He held firmly to that
,refu_sal. '  a
A compromise was arranged
whereby Elena would be awarded her
doctorate if she passed the
examinations.
The convocation _ for her
examination was set for June 25,
1978. -The number of spectators
was so large that at the last moment,
the examination site was transferred
‘fromthe Padua University Hall to the
Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin; in a
rigorous oral examination, her

examiners spared her nothing as they
questioned her on difficult points of
logic. in classic Latin, she explained
difficult and *randomly chosen

. passages from Aristotle's writings, to

the spectators‘ amazement. And so,
amid great applause, Elena Cornaro
Plscopia was invested with the
Teacher's Ermine Cape, received the
Doctor’s Ring on her finger, was
crowned with the Poet's Laurel
Crown, and was elevated to the high
dignity of Magistra et Doctrix
Philosphiae—-Master and Doctor of
Philosophy, according to Fusco. She
was 32. '

Her death onJu|y 25, 1684, at the

I age of 38, was mourned widely. In

accordance with her wishes, _she was

clothed in the black habit of the_

Benedictine oblates and buried in the
mortuary of the Benedictine monks at
the Abbey Church of St. Justina,
Padua.

This year, there have been many
celebrations to mark the tercentenary
of the conferring of Elena’s degree.
The University of Pittsburgh coor-
dinated the worldwide
Celebrations. Renewed interest in

the Cornaro," has led to the

restoration of_her grave and a new

place in modern minds as one of
the most extraordinary women of all
time. ‘ '

A Fashionsand Accents

By TERRI voer

vIt’s easy to adore the new fall and
winter fashions when a gorgeous,

lithe model is wearing them. But what

about a woman with an uneven
figure?
Big-bosomed women have
problems finding shirts to fit, for
example, and women with heavy hips

.should avoid pleated pants with

narrow legs. L '

“A woman with an abundant
bosom looks best in longer, unfitted
jackets with a smaller IapeI,” said
Peggy Price, a.Pittsburgh model. “A
plain or dark-colored unfitted vest will
also help slim the bustline.” '

This winter’s styles employ. wide

shoulders-and narrow, tapered skir-

tlines. “This style seems to even out
the figure that is heavy atthe hips,’-'
said Price. “The long, straighter skir-
ts and slacks help to minimize the
“silhouette.” I

A large-hipped woman also may

qwjtwear a_ printed top or plaid jacket with

dark‘ or solid pants," Price said.
Price -also offered some fashion
suggestions for a woman with a
heavy figure. “A tent dress, belted or
not, is flattering to almost all figures,”
she. said. “Narrow _everi_ing pants,

- , To many women, makeup and skin
care areas important to their ap-
pearances as the clothes they wear.

When choosing cosmetics, con-
sider skin type and color, facial
features, hair style and color and
clothing.

"‘People are recognizing that
cosmetic usage doesn't‘ involve only
color, but skin care and treatment,”
said Jan Isabel, a Clinique cosmetics
representative. . ' _ . '

Cleansing, toning and conditioning
are the three steps of skincare.

.’?Cleansing does more than. remove

dirt; it sloughs off dead skin cells and
. thus speeds the growth of new skin.
A loofa sponge is one device used to
do this. " — _ ‘
The trend in soaps (for. those who
use soaps at all) is toward those that

combined with a long, loose tunic,
also provides a great camouflage for
any figure problem.”—.

The layered look, very popular for
winter, also helps to minimize the
hips, Price said. '

“Hats are back, especially the
veiled cocktail hat  said Debbie
Herp, a buyer for Max Axen's tall
girl department.

Herp predicted the need for ac-
cessories will be greater in the up-
coming months.

A short woman, Herp said, can
lengthen her appearance by wearing
textured stockings with shorter
boots. “The tip togremember when
wearing shorter boots is to coor-
dinate your stocking color with the
color of the boots,” said Herp.

Since the fall line emphasises a
taller, slimmer look, tall women may
want to accent their height. But if one
wants to break up, a long line, belts
are the best bet. "Wear two ata
time.” said Herp. “or wear the new

wrapped-around-twice belts." A _

A new accessory that has attrac-
tedxa lot of interest is the fur tail
lariats, according to Herp. It can be
worn as a belt or as a neck piece. Fur
accessories such as belts and mink

fragrance or alkali. One such soap is
Lazlo’s, the first Cosmetic soap ever
made. A bar costs from $6.50 to
$10, but Lazlo claims it will last for a
full year. V

_ The purpose of toning is to
freshen" skin, tighten pores and

remove any traces of cleanser. Oily «

skin requires a strong toner (one with
a high alcohol content); dry skin
requires a mild toner. _

, Replacing lost moisture andoils
keeps one's skin healthy.‘_ Avon's
Perfect Balance Eye Cream is a good
choice for all skin types, as the skin.
around the eyes is particularly
delicate and dry. Those with unifor-

mly dry or flaky skin may choose .

by L’Oreal and Progres Creme de

Estee Lauder, like many cosmetic
companies, collaborates closely with
fashion designers. Makeup is con-

stantly being updated, as new colors

Natural, earthy colors and muted
shades are in; bright blues, greens,
reds and oranges are out. The most
popular shade of ‘blushes and lip-
sticks now is burgundy, and gray and
brown are the . fashionable
eyeshadow colors. Foundations and

. I was a charm school dropout: For
eight weeks, with several other

 graceless 12-year-olds, I practiced
Vwalking as if mincing on eggshells

with a copy of Webster's Unabridged
Dictionary on my head. The teacher,
a’ middle-aged woman with a blonde
beehive and eyelashes that could kill,
made just two memorable statemen-
ts: Wash once a week with Lava
soap to dry out pimples, and never‘
-wear ankle bracelets. At the end of
the course, all I had gained were a
stlffineck, ‘a ﬂaking complexion and

« unadorned anklebones.

Fashion's Rule: Iron

defects, demonstrate. Mask a poin-
ted chin with brown ‘shadow;
camoflage wide hips with a tent
dress; curl straight hair; straighten
curly hair. Glamour should be called
Physical Therapy. And not only do
these magazines push beauty—their
ads and articles link it to romance and
competence, by‘ implying that a
woman can be a super mother,
businesswoman-and sex symbol by
flicking her hair up and down and
dabbing on the right perfume. Or im-
prove her social life by enlarging her
bustline. ~

Outwardly, I rebelled against the
popular standard of beauty for years.
I replaced my buttons with safety
pins, let my bangs hang below my
eyeglasses, wore my skirts wrinkled
and backed away from girls who said,
“But you'd look cute with curled

' eyelashes!" in a tone of saccharine
‘ and acid. lnwardly, l'cringed‘when-

boys.

In a clumsy way, I began to con-
form, experimenting with hairstyles,
clothes and makeup. I got split ends
from having my hair razored a la Vidal
Sassoon, which grew into a shag
carpet-like hairdo. Then I got a per-
manent that made me look like Chico
Marx. I got premature midriff bulge
from rolling up my high school uniform
skirt to fashionable length, broken
capillaries from trying to massage
away cellulite, chapped knees from
overexposure. ~

The truth Janis Ian said she lear-

ned at 17 thus was impressed upon
me year after adolescent year. Along
with my friends, I became a beauty
hypochondriac, wailing in that familiar
and peculiar language of women, “I’m

too zitty. .  and waiting for the expec-

What kind of stupid question is that, l

I thought. How should I know? It wasn't

I my decision to make this a formal affair.

I would have been satisfied with a mere
semi‘-formal gathering. ‘
But I knew since the occasion
required formal dress, I had to follow
the proper rules“ of proper dress-
color-coordinated shirt, ill-fitting vest,
ﬂoppy cumberbund, polyester. pants,
over-sized coat,“ velvetbow tie, and
tight, shiny patent leather shoes. I“
didn't make the rules—I simply played

the game. L —

“And that's why,” she said smiling
maternally, “today's kids here at the
airport are all dressed up for a change.
This is Marie Torre, KDKA news.”
Actually, she was wiong._ Dressing
-up is a social standard enforced in

‘children at an early age, through the

fear of God. To attend church anything
less than spotlessly dressed-which,
in itself, was an ,erdeal—was ,a social
sin condemned by the entire
congregation. Shoes had to be
polished every Saturday night. Pants
were neatly pressed and a stiff white
shirt provided Sunday morning. ..After

it seems, will never grant themselves
a seal of approval, like the one the

norwill they let anyone else grant it to
them.

I would like to say_ that, as I grew
older, I realized the value of cliches
such as “you can’t judge a book by
its cover,” and decided to devote
myself to charitable works. Untrue,
although how I look is no longer the
burning concern of my life (or anyone

as they age). Beauty magazines still
are like salted peanuts to me—once I

- inspection, you were fit to pray. ﬂ
One Sunday, our .pastor gave a “

sermon on dress in church.. “It
doesn't matter how you show up,” he
said, brushing the lint off his flowing
black robe. "The Lord will-accept you
no matter what your dress.”

One prarishoner tested this theory.
The very next ‘Sunday, he came to
church_ in a dirty gray sweatshirt,

 ragged blue jeans, sweat socks and ‘

old tennis shoes. He was allowed in-the
church, just like the pastor had said\ he
would be-, but he sat in a pew by him-
self, for he didn't want to embarrass his
shame-faced family. A No ‘one ever
followed his example. _

Once the rule of fashion is made
and the social nonn set, it is impossible
to break, without repercussions.’ While
visitinga friend, ‘I was refused entrance I
to a nightspot because I was wearing a
T-shirt.

But this incident made me realize
the fashion game existed.

Now I realize the reasons behind my

. problems with dress. I know a certain

nightspot or restaurant is trying to keep
up a certain image, and so enforces a

dress code. I realize that the
congregation inf_a church expects a

certain amount of respect, throughﬁ:

dress. And I know why our colors mat-

Janice just wanted to lose a little

, weight. She was tired of having her

father pat her on the bottom and call
her the owner of the world's oldest
baby fat. All she needed to lose was
10 pounds and then she'd be perfect

She lost it. Her father
congratulated her; her mother was
envious. Her boyfriend warned her
not to slip away from him. But when
Janice looked in the mirror, she still
saw flabby thighs and a face too
round to be beautiful. She began
running three miles in the morning
"and skipping breakfast. . She just
wasn't hungry anymore.
The 10 pounds became 20.

‘Janice, 5’ 2”, now weighed 99

pounds. She liked the sound of it.

When her boyfriend told her she
looked like a little boy, Janice burst
into tears. She cried a lot lately. Her
mother began pushing desserts on
her at dinner time, but Janice told
herself that her mother wasn't con-
c_erned—just jealous.

~ Janice became obsessed with

food. One night, when everyone was -
in bed, she ate a whole jar of peanut

butter, two boxes of cereal, a pound
of cheese. She left for school before
everyone else got up so she wouldn't
have to face her mother.‘ When she

- got to school "she walked into the

bathroom. Revolted by her own glut-
tony, she leaned over the toilet and
forced herself to vomit.

Janice kept track of every calorie

sick—and she was sick a lot. But she

itment, but never showed-up. She

still got up to run three miles every
morning. '

Except for those nights of raiding
the refrigerator, Janice’s idea of a
normal dinner was a cup of plain
yogurt. Never fruit—that was too fat-
tening. She began to look at fat
people on the street and at her paren-
ts, feeling both disgusted and afraid.

T She was proud of the control she had

over her weight—and terrified of
losing it. ’

Janice and, her boyfriend broke
up. Janice -told herself it was
because she was too busy and he

- was immature. Her boyfriend said he

couldn't stand watching her starve
herself to death. Janice didn't know
what he was talking about. If those
models could weigh 115, why
couldn't she weigh 90?

When her mother discovered
Janice hadn't had a period in six mon-
ths, she. insisted Janice go to the

mother—who looked anxious all ‘the
time—and told her the doctor said
there was nothing wrong. Repulsed
by her lies, she took an extra big
dose of laxatives as punishment.
Although Janice was never a bad
student,_ she now became ‘ a
remarkable one. She carried an 18-
credit course load. Janice got A's on
all her mid-terms and A's on all her
papers. 'Her teachers adored her. .
She was glad her teachers adored

her because she seemed to have '
. fewer and fewer friends. Some who

hadn't seen her for a few months
didn't even recognize her.

According to Dr. Hilda Bruch,
there are tens of thousands of young
women like Janice across the coun-
try. Theyare victims of a mental
illness called anorexia nervosa (ner-
vous loss of appetite). But it is a men-
tal illness with a grotesque physical
aspect—-a woman with anorexia star-
ves herself to the point of emaciation
and sometimes death. V '

Bruch believes a basic cause of

anorexia is the woman's delusion that "

she is failing to live up to her own and
to her parents’ expectations. ‘ An
anorexic feels that whatever she
does, it will never be enough for her-
self or for her parentsj She feels un-
worthy of love, Bruch said.

The -anorexic strives for what is
considered model behavior. Before

the onset of the disease, according ’

to Bruch, she is the good baby and
the‘ nice girl. But the niceness and
the conformity cover a feeling of
powerlessness. According to Bruch,

anorexia is for many women the first
successful rebellion in her life. Con-
trol over her body gives.her a new

Freshman Finds No Continental Ro

(Continued from page 9)

As I packed for college, ap-
proximately five years after my
mother’s halting explanation of sex, I
found myself fantasizing about a man
who’d have the body of Adonis, the
words of Shakespeare, the jealous
love of Othello,. and good manners
that my parents would like. He'd
be....

“Julie, mon chere.”

“Pierre. Oooh, you mustn’t.”

“Oh, but I must, my buttercup. To

The door to my room rattles and
flies open. A wild cossack in a bear-
skin coat charges into the room.

“Ah hahl" he bellows.

“Boris!” l shout, amazed.

“‘Zo you, a funny-talking, frog-
eating Frenchman, is trying to steal
my voman. Eh?” Boris says, pointing

at Pierre.

“Frog-eater?” I say. I _\

“He spit on me,?’ Pierre whines.
“Boris, that was disgusting-,"_l say.
turning my back on him,
Boris draws a saber from under his

coat.

ween them. ‘‘If you two are going to

-But reality trod with steady’ step
upon these dreams, and l was
packed off to school.

I didn't meet any wild cossacks,
nor did anyone particularly notice the
cuff of my jeans. I did learn that my
mother's morality code was out-
moded. At school, the distinction

between the girls who do and the

girls who don't still exists. but there
are infinite variations on the theme.

Senator Contends Energy Supplies Not Depleted

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Sen. Harrison (Jack) Schmitt,
R-N.M., a former Apollo 17 crew
member, insisted last night before
members of P~itt’s School of
Engineering Energy Resource de-
partment that America’s energy
resources are not as depleted as the
American public has been lead to
believe.

Schmitt said there are consider-
able supplies of both oil and natural
gas to be extracted from the earth's
surface. He referred to alleged vast
oil supplies located off the coasts of
Alaska, Canada and California.

Schmitt added that there are
approximately 300 billion barrels of
oil and 700 trillion ‘cubic feet of
domestic gas left untapped.

“It is not a resource-based
problem that we are faced with; it is a
development problem,” ' Schmitt
said. “We must foster an economic

base for the production of oil and
gas, because we already have the
technology to do this.”

Schmitt said American’s first
must satisfy their needs for a
short-term domestic energy supply,
while developing a trend toward the
use of inexhaustible sources of
energy. He called the need for a
transition from oil and gas to other
energy sources a major problem on
America’s energy horizon.

“First of all, we must decide what
the federal government's role is and
what it is going to be in solving
these energy problems,”_ Schmitt
said. “We also must determine
what the federal government can do
best and what the private sector
does best in contributing to
solutions.” _

The freshman senator said both
the government and American
universities should form research
teams to develop more efficient

ways of extracting unused energy
supplies.

“There must be loan guarantees
set up by the government to
encourage the private sector toward
governmental investing in energy,
but there will have to be something
to make the taxpayer believe that
the risk in such investments is very
small,” the senator said.

Schmitt added that the level of
bureaucracy needed to achieve that
goal is not great but that the present
administration has shown no
inclination toward such a move.
Schmitt also beleives Congress

, should be more receptive to energy

tax reform and deregulation.

“It’s up to the government to .

realize we can’t use gas .and oil
forever,” he said. “The future must
insure that as the supplies continue,
we must begin a transition away
from even the_cheapest.'form_s of gas

Schmitt also cited solar energy as
a possible future source of energy.
“Solar energy is probably the most
economically feasible and also will
provide a great contribution to our

  Discusses Plays of Pih‘ Football Clinic

By KAREN KADILAK .
Pitt News Staff Writer

Steeler quarterback Mike
Kruczek c at Pitt for Monday’s
football clinic in the Student Union,
said he doesn’t‘know if he will play
with the Steelers next season.

“I’d love to stay here, but I’ve
reached that fork in the road where
I have to make a decision as to
whether I want to stay and back

Terry (Bradshaw) up or play‘

regularly‘ somewhere else,”
Kruczek said. “It really didn’t
bother Terry (Hanratty) to back
Bradshaw up when he was playing
for the Steelers. Well, it bothers
me. I’ve been here three years.
It may be time for me to move on
soinewhere else.”

Kruczek said he would not give
the ‘Steelers a “trade me or play

me” ultimatum as some players

_ do.

“I wouldn’t do anything like
that. I just have to do some serious

' three elements havecome together,

and this, coupled with some new
Mark compositions, makes “Other
Peoples Rooms” not only the ﬁnest
Mark-Almond album to date, but
also a deﬁnite front-runner can-
didate for a top jazz chart position.

The prime cuts on the album are
“The City” and the “Girl On Table
4.” These songs are similar in that A

thinking about the situation after
the off-season,” he said.
Drafted from -Boston College in

1976, Kruczek led the Steelers to-.

several victories during his rookie
seasonwhen Bradshaw was in-
jured. He has played little since
then.

“I’m happy we’re winning this
year,” Kruczek said. “I wish
were contributing more, but at
least we’re winning—although we
haven’t been playing well.”

‘ Kruczek, born in Fairfax, Vir-
ginia, lives in Newton, Mass. in the
off-season/. He never had been in
Pittsburgh before signing with the
Steelers.

“Pittsburgh is a great football
town,” Kruczek said. “lvlove it
here. _ I enjoy playing here.
The fans are great, although I don’t
particularly agree with some of the
city’s sportswriters.

Other highlights of the album are

“Lonely People” along with guest

talents into the album.‘ .

in Pittsburgh with jazz violinist Jean

dous response. Following their
encore at the Stanley, Mark

positive copy. They like to dwell on
negative publicity. I’ll read what
they have to write once and awhile.
Iread it when we win and don’t read

For the first time, Kruczek plans“

to stay in Pittburgh during the "

off-season and investiga’te'various
job opportunities.

“I majored in business and
minored in ﬁnancing,” Kruczek
said. I hope my background will

‘A Dreomof Passion’

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt NcwsStalTWri!er A
A Dream of Passion
Directed by Jules Dassin

“A Dream of Passion” is an
overblown effort by director-writer
Jules Dassin and his wife, actress
Melina Mercouri, who would have
done well to confine the passion to
dreams. Instead, they make passion
90 percent of the ﬁlm, and it is
expressed solely by the emotional
Mercouri. ' .

“A Dream of Passion” centers on
Maya (Mercouri), a famous actress
who is portraying Medea. As the
play goes into production, Maya
meets a real-life Medea (Ellen
Burstyn) as a publicity gimmick.

Burstyn plays Brenda, a rather,

Other moments, with Mercouri
back at the theater or submitting to a
BBC interview, are weak and seem
to have been thrown in for a bit of
balance. And without a strong
support, Mercouri becomes so
unwieldy and melodramatic that she
borders on parody.

Have Panthers Found

By BOB LABRIOLA
‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

The key word is “conﬁdence.”

The’ relationship between con-
ﬁdence and success is entwined and
complicated, much like football's
versionof Catch-22: In order to have
success, one must have conﬁdence,
but in order to have conﬁdence, one
must experience success.

After Pitt’s 52-7 drubbingrof West

Virginia, the consensus among the.

players and coaches is that the
Panthers have achieved the success

that breeds conﬁdence that breeds.
success.

“Without question, this win built
up our conﬁdence,” said coach
Jackie Sherrill.

“The win boosted us 90 percent
on our morale scale,” said
defensive end Hugh Green. “Con-
ﬁdence is so important to us because
we are so young.”

Assistant coach Joe Pendry,‘ who

.u.‘__works exclusivelywith the quarter-

Ii

backs, saw immediate results in his
area of concern. . ,
“Rick Trocano played his most
consistent game Saturday,” said
Pendry. “The quarterback has to
control the game, and when the
whole team starts moving the ball,
the. quarterback gains conﬁdence.
You could see it in his eyes when

~ 1 Rick came off the ﬁeld.”

«pug
#1

Although conﬁdent enough to call

the majority of the offensive plays I

from the line of scrimmage, Trocano

'_ does not yet;have a cockyeeconﬁderice ~

about his passing; somewhat

understandable considering‘ the .

amount of criticism directed its way.

“The best thing Ricky has done
this year is not to
_interceptions,” said Pendry. “Only
three of his interceptions have come
on balls that should not have been
thrown. The rest came either at the
end of a half, the end of a game or
bounced off the receiver’s hands._

“But sometimes he gets so
conservative he holds onto the ball
because ‘he’s afraid of the
interception,” Pendry continued.
“On the ﬂea ﬂicker Saturday, Ricky
had Steve Gaustad behind the
secondary, but he saw the

 cornerback hanging and threw the
in!

safety valve instead. He should

   

 

throw"

   

‘ Rooster Jones led aII,rushers Saturday.

have gone ahead and thrown it
deep.” ‘

Both Sherrill and Pendry main-
tained the coaching staff did
nothing special to. generate 500 total
yards and 52 points.

“We .didn’t open up our
offense,” said Sherrill. ‘ ‘We ran the
same plays we’ve been using all
year, we just executed better.”

According to Pendry, the ability
to make the big play is what
separated this offensive perfor-
mance from all the others. The

 

  

-

._ A p . Evangelista photo

  

obvious example of this is Rooster
Jones, who rushed for 169 yards.
Pendry was also pleased with the
way the receivers “went into a

(crowd and held onto the ball,”

which puts a smile on _the face of any
quarterback as well’as his coach.
With bowl selections to be made

this Saturday, the Panthers appear
to be in the running for four minor
bids--Tangerine, Holiday, Hall of
Fame and Garden State. Sherrill_
met with the seniors Monday and .
they listed’ their preferences.

Rumors are that the seniors would

' prefer a trip’ to San Diego (Holiday

Bowl), but the Tangerine Bowl
(Orlando, Fla.) may offer Pitt the
best package.
, “If you’re not ﬁghting for the
,national championship, the bowl
game shouldbe fun,” said Sherrill.
“You like to go where the players
have a good feeling about going.
You want to go where the bowl
people take good care of the players
and make it fun.” .

Jones’ Performance Proves  

  Ability Unrelated tosize

Rushing for a career high 169

,yards and scoring two touchdowns"

Rooster Jones believes he proved
something in Pitt’s 52-7 win over
West Virginia.

“I think I showed people our
running backs still can do the job,"
said Jones, the Panthers’ offensive
player of the week. “I know people
are saying our backs are too small
and that Pitt needs bigger backs to
get the extra yardage inside. We
aren’t- too small. We're about
average as far as height and weight
are concerned.” ‘ ‘

One of the team’s “pony backs,”
the 5-foot-8, 180-pound Jones
received his share ofcriticism before .
Saturday. < I . ' _ _

“There were rumors that one of
the freshmen was going to take my 

. '\

   

 

place,” said the sophomore, who so
far has‘ started every game. “But I
didn't let it bother me. I didn't feel
any pressure at all.
“If someone had replaced me, all
I really could have done‘was try to get
my job back,” he added. “I
believed I was doing my best, and I
was satisﬁed. If no one else was
happy" with the way I way playing,
there really was nothing I could
do.” '
Jones, however, added that
“somehow things could be better.” _
“I'd like to carry the ball more,”
he said. ‘,‘I’d like to run 20 or more
times a game, which I've done only
once this season (20 carries against
Boston College). I’m not being
selﬁsh ‘or greedy by saying this, but
any back likes to carry it that much.

is not true. I'll do anything to help the" 
team. I block pretty well. One of my} - 
blocks sprung Larry Sims loose for air“ "
touchdown Saturday.” 

Jones, who last season rushed fort’:
63 yards in a_ reserve role, went into.
this season thinking he could gain at  ,_ T
least 700 yards. . After Saturday’s-  1. 
performance, Jones still believes he '
can achieve that goal. ’ * -

 
   
   
 

“I have more than 500 yards 
now," the sophomore said. “All I’ll._.'
have to do is pick up 100 yards in ear: '
of the last two games and I’ll betin:

of inexperience. John Bonessi,
although a junior, never had tasted
collegiate competition, and Scott ’
Thunberg, a freshman, was also new
in the ranks. .
“We had a lack of experience at

ically said they wanted to ‘play in G

certain bowl situations,” the coach
said.

But Paterno cautioned, “They
don’t‘want to play just any place in

’ It all depends on how No. 2

- Missouri. .

“Speculation_ is what everybody

is doing and that’s what we’re

doing,” Paterno said. “What I'm

trying ‘to say is if Nebraska wins,
that's where we would go.”

along well in the long run. This,
along with the lack of scoring, was
our downfall.”

Despite the goalkeepers’ inexper-
ience, the Panthers still were able to
win five of their six wins by shutouts.
Besides Thunberg . shutting out
Bethany, Indiana and Camegie-
Mellon‘ (1-0), Bonessie added a 3-1
win at Edinboro and shutout Gannon
and Penn State (2-0).

The win over Penn State
highlighted the Panthers’ season.

“If we had gone out for every team
like we did for Penn State, we would

likely drop in the rankings.

“The squad and‘I have talked ’

somewhat about playing the No. 2
team and the logical team is
Nebraska,” Paterno said, “but if
they lose we’ll have to think about
somebody else. '
“Saturday at 6 p.m., we’ll know
for sure. If Nebraska loses and

Georgia wins, I think ‘we have a"

tough decision to make on whether
it's Georgia in the Sugar Bowl or

Pitt's 2,651 total series was its-
second highest score of the year.

was led by Haber’s 579 ‘ series,

game per man today,” . said
F endler. ‘ ‘We did this by shooting a
lot of spares, rather than having a

charge of player development for the
