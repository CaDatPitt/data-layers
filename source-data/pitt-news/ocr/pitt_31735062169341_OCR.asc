UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Carmichael Defines Power;

by nonmrr ZAVOS

The Civil Rights move-
ment could be described as
“powerless conscious meet-
ing consciousless power,” ex-
plained Stokely Carmichael,
director of the Student x~Non-

violent Coordinating Committee

-(SNCC), in a 2 p.m. talk last

Thursday. _

Speaking before an overﬂow
crowd in the SU Ballroom, he
reviewed his stand on black pow-
er and explained how the nation-
al news media has distorted his
views.

“Black power is economic pow-
er,” noted Carmichael; “The black
people must be able to shape
and control their own commun-
ities just as the Irish, the Jews,
the Italians, and other minor-
ities do."

“The black people have not
been able to control their own
communities because of the wide-
spread institutional racism of the
white people,” stated Carmichael.
“Ghettos grow spontaneously
throughout all of the large indus-
trial cities due to identical ra-
cial attitudes.”

' Black people are constantly
denied equality in jobs, housing,
education, and medical facilities.
For example, 500 -black children
die, each year in Birmingham,
Ala., due to inadequate medical
attention, and thousands more
suffer birth defects for the same
reason. _ I

A highly enthusiastic crowd
listened intentively at his main
points which were interspersed
with humorous remarks and jokes.
“They tell us there are 20 mil-
lion blacks,” he explained, “but
I think there’s more . . . what if

 we ﬁnd out that we’re a major-

ity?”

Carmichael was especially cri-
tical of the “white-controlled
news media." He accused them
of giving “a superﬁcial and mis-
leading” account of his state-
ments. Once the New York Times
printed the entire context of a‘
speech and the wire services took
one ‘small statement out of con-
text, which gave people a differ-
ent impression of what he had
meant.

The issue of the Vietnam War
came out at the question and
answer session which followed
his speech. When asked what
could be done to end the war, he
succinctly replied, “Don't go when
the draft board calls.”

He explained, “No one is go-

Earth Shift
Cracks Street
In Oakland

The General State Authority

(GSA). ordered O’Hara Street
closed‘ Friday when an earth
shift, caused’ a four-inch crack in
that Oakland thoroughfare: The
crack,_ which appeared near the
present construction of the Uni-
versity’s engineering building,
could pose problems to two-ten-
inch steam lines which service
nearby University buildings.

Officials propose to remove a
section of O’Hara Street to light-
en it and to reduce the chances
of a slide, -and to install external
supports for the steam lines. The
‘steamlines will be fully exposed.

The O’Hara Street Garage 

remain open, however.‘

The GSA district engineer has
asked that area utility ﬁrms sub-
mit maps. to hini showing the
position of -any other utility lines
which might be threatened in an
effort to prevent future problems.
The site has been plagued by pre-
vious -earth movement problems.

ing is, being constructed between

National Commission
Recommends Dropping
Student-Deferments

(See.Editom'aH
“The Fishbowl F'olly”—Page 4)

Equality is the Watchword
of the report of the Presi-
dent’s National Advisory
Commission of the Selective
Service, released Saturday.
The report calls for the abol-
ishment of local draft boards,
drafting of 19-year olds be-
fore o1der._ registrants, and
the establishment of a lottery-
like system of “impartial random
selections.”

The proposed plan would abol-
ish student deferments and occu-
pational deferments. It would
also make it more difficult to

escape active service through
membership in reserves and Na-

. tional Guard forces. On reaching

18, all men would register and
undergo the “physical, moral, and
educational achievement tests and
evaluations which determine their
eligibility for military service.”

Those classiﬁed 1A, while still
18, would be exposed to »a sys-
tem of impartial random selec-
tion. The commission recommend-
ed no particular selection system,

SC} iMeeting Becomes

Marathon

Committeemen Elected

by ALAN DISLER

In a marathon four-and-a-
half hour meeting Thursday
night, Student Government
(SG) selected student mem-
bers to the Allocations Com-
mittee, the Recognition Com-
mittee, approved an alloca-
tion for Ideas and Figures,
and passed bill-s to reorganize

the Recognitions Committee, cre-
ate a Traditions Committee, a

"Publicity Committee, and‘ named

a chairman to the Off-Campus
Housing Committee. U

The major problem, which
forced SG into its longest meet-
ing in two years, concerned the
selection of the. Allocations Com-
mittee. President ‘Ken Frederick
nominated Cathy Baierl, Dan
Booker, Mike Bryson, and Ron
Cowell, and ﬂoor nominations
were Anne Baker, nominated by
Sen. Denni Rinovato, and Terry
Hyman, nominated by Sen. Abe
Singer. _ I

On the ﬁrst ballot, Booker,
Bryson, and Miss Baierl received
the necessary two-thirds major-
ity of senators present. After
striking Hyman from contention
for receiving the least number of
votes, the Senate proceeded to
vote nine times before ﬁnally
settling on Cowell.

Frederick nominated Mike Wein-
garten and Sen. Anne Baker for
the Recognitions Committee, and
Sens. Jon Meyers. and Kathy Mc-
Hugh. were nominated from the
ﬂoor. Since only four nomina-

. tions were made for the four-

man committee, Vice-president

Tom. Meisner sdelclaired all candi- -.

tion taken by the ‘Allocations
Committee on a $331 request
from Ideas and Figures (I&F)
for a ﬁlm series. The committee
decided to approve $150 and sug-
gested I&F consider working with
the Student Union Board to cut
costs. Bill Cabin reported that
$13,230 remains unallocated.
Sen. Singer's bill reorganizing
the Recognitions Committee pro-A

- vided for complete student con-

trol of student organizations. It
was passed, along with two
amendments. One provided for a
member of the administration,
the faculty, and two members of
the President's Council to sit in
on the committee but have no
vote. The other speciﬁed that
members of the committee be
nomiI_1ated by the Senate or the
president.

The Senate suspended its rules
to permit Dave Guyden, director
of publicity for SC}, to speal: on
the bill deﬁning the role of the
director of publicity. ,

The bill, which was passed,

I calls for the creation of a Public-
ity Committee which would su-

perintend the publicity of SG.
This committee, chaired by the
director of publicity, would be re-
sponsible for maintaining bulle-
tin boards at various points on
campus announcing SG activities,
mailing pout "newsletters once a
trimester to all full-time under-
graduate students on all cam-
puses, maintaining suggestion box-
es, submitting A bi-weekly brief to
the Pitt News of SG activities,
and setting up a SG information
booth at the Activities Fair.
In other ’ activity, the‘ Senate
elected Jack LaPietra chairman

report stated. “Men would

determined. Every man ‘in the,-
cligible pool would know wherefi‘
he stands on the list.” ' '
During their 19th year, men 
the pool would undergo their -1‘.
maximum vulnerability to the?
draft. When that year is up, ‘af-
new pool of 19-year olds would”
be formed and the remaining ‘
men in the previous pool would
not be called unless military cir-
cumstances ﬁrst required: calli.n'g,.-,.
all of the men in the new group.-
The nation’s, 4,100 _local draft
beards would go out of existence
as a major part of this proposed ‘E!
plan. These boards would be re-' '
placed by 300-500 area offices
where civil servants would choose
inductees under “clear and bind-
ing” standards , .

Both reports agreed that the _
order of the existing draft call
should be reversed so that the
youngest eligible inductees, those‘
19, would be taken ﬁrst, rather;
than the oldest, those 25. The
reports disagreed, however, on
the desirability of a lottery. The

be ‘neither fair nor in the nation-

It is a commonplace in litera-
ture that humor ages badly.\Not
iall,,surely, but who say how
many of the puns, quibbles and
double-entendres in Jonson and
‘Shakespeare are lost entirely on
audiences unfamiliar with the
text? Sheridan and Congreve
have the sting and beauty of
_ their wit_ preserved; Wilde is not
"i yet the slave“ of his footnotes;
_still one laughs with a profound
6 sense of their respective theatres

5 as creatures whose humorous .
sources lay -in the past and are
_ there yet.

, There may well be a day when
I George Bernard Shaw will be re-

‘ worse yet, the man's plays may
‘be discovered to be historically
relevant someday, and imbed
themselves in the closed stacks
or all the libraries, unstaged and
glunread, to acquire a rich green
patina of dramatic immobility
*’ and critical neglect.

l'.t0 sprinkle dust around Shaw’s
best plays. It was still possible to
enjoy the excellent production of
"Arms _and the Man given by the
‘University Theatre last -Friday

.‘?‘written before the turn of the
‘entury.

James Berry, who played Ma-
i jor Saranoﬁ‘, has appeared in
9‘, Mary Stuart, Measure for Meas-
re, and Duches off Malﬁ. His
‘-very excellent performance is in-
ateresting chieﬂy because his act-
_.in.g technique for the period plays
, has been turned on its head for
fArms and the Man. Berry’s ges-
‘tures and stage business have be-
" ome almost a mannerism in his
performance. One ‘could almost
Ilplot his orbits around’ the stage in
Duchess of Malﬁ by"the way his
ariiigcrooked before a stride.
TIT1 the Shaw play, Mr. Berry
turns his whole stock of period-
-ftragedien movements, attitudes
in-and delivery techniques into a
{comment on themselves. It is for-
funate indeed that he is so self-
are. The position he holds in
he play is a central one, though
ithisgis not obvious from the text.
"I-li’s—role as the butt of Shaw’s
oke- on .the comic-opera grand
_;manner, on the “higher” emo-
' ions, on “spiritual” love, ranges
round itself all the other per-
mances except Louka, Nichola,
nd ‘Captain Bluntschli.

._All performances improved per-
eptibly throughout Act II. ‘The

structure of the ﬁrst act in the
play itself. It is possible that Don-
ald Flayton as Captain Blunt-
schli needed the splendid pom-
posity of Dan Frezza as Major
Petkoff and Berry as Saranoff
before his function in the play
sharpened his acting: he is the
perfect Shavian man.

Dan Frezza’s handling of the
irony and casual realism the part
demands is as true to Shaw’s
purpose as Cathy‘Rennich’s was
to the part of the servant. The
whole dramatic structure is a
forest of foils and it  to ‘Van-
dalie Henshaw’s credit that the
timing and cuing was as prac-
ticed and impeccable as it ap-
peared; half the beauty of Shaw
is the pleasure of hearing the ac-

‘tors fence among themselves with-

out the drabness and lull of or-
dinary conversation.

there is almost always difficulty
in removing heavy scenery, dou-

the revolving sets were not used

The naked machinery of the
sets and the exposed stage after
Arms and the Man were used as
the environment of Chek'nOv’s

play is a perceptive addition to

Phi Kappa Theta Ends  
48 Hour Card Game

Last weekend the Phi Kappa Theta social fraternity sponsored
a Pinocle marathon which ran from 6:30 p.m. Thursday until 6:05 p.m.
Saturday. The total time of the marathon was» 48 hours, 5 minutes.
There were two teams participating in the marathon. Team two,
the winning team, consisted of Tom Sitoski and Joe Schimizzi. Team
1, the losers, was made up of Charles Dorato and Rich _Weshelak. The

ﬁnal score was 8,441 points for
team two to 8,369 points for team
one. —

During’ the course of the mara-
thon, there was a total of 532
hands played. There was also
three misdeals. The team mem-
bers were allowed a ﬁve minute
break every hour. During the
course Of the tournament the par-
ticipants changed clothes four
times and took two showers. But
they made a rule that “they could
not shave during the marathon.”

The- marathon received a good

deal of publicity. KQV, a popu-
lar Pittsburgh radio station, dub-
bed itself “the official marathon
station” with Tom Lee giving
plugs every hour. . P

The whole idea of a Pinocle
marathon was endorsed by the

Equality of Sexes

Women Gain New Privileges

by LAWRIE H. NICKERSON
T/ze Collegiate Press Service

Women students are suc-
ceeding in gaining the same
social privileges that men
have long enjoyed, as college
administrators do away with
long-standing dormitory reg-
ulations.

The most recent rules upheaval,
at the University of Alabama,
with
parental approval, free visitation

permits women students

permission.

The old visitation rules, which
ended March 1, forbade women
to enter men’s apartments un-

der any circumstances. But pres-

sure to change the policy began
as early as 1958 when the Asso-
ciated Women Students _ (AWS)
ﬁrst submitted an appealto the
university president. AWS com-
pleted a survey of 39 surround-
ing -schools, similar to the uni-
versity in size, which revealed
that most of the schools studied
had liberal visitation policies.

Changes are not limited to one A

section of the country. The Uni-
versity of Washington has an-
nounced its decision to eliminate

‘imposed women’s hours and sub-

stitute a policy of allowing stu-
dents to vote on their own hours.

At the University of California
at Los Angeles women students
under 21 have been ﬁ'eed from
curfew regulations. The decision
was endorsed by the associate
dean of students housing, Wil-
liam Locklear, who said-that pre-
vious universi_ty policy was in-
consistent with the school’s state-
ment to entering students that
they will be treated as adults.

In a similar decision by ad-
ministrators at the University of
Chicago, students in eachhouse
were allowed to submit their own
curfews, to the dean of students
for approval. . .

Some of UC’s houses requested
extension of hours by 330 per
cent and, in one instance, com-
plete abolition of curfew.

The orderly changes in housing
regulations at UCLA and Chicago
are in sharp contrast to action
by students at Stanford Univer-
sity. Irate Stanford dormitory
residents organized a ten-day
postponement of rent payments
in support of off-campus housing
for women.

The rent strike was considered
a success by participants, al-
though no action has been taken
by university officials. Stanford
President_Wallace Sterling said

he would prepare an interim re-
port for the Board of Trustees
"as soon as possible.” He added,
however, that “it may not be
feasible . . to reach any deci-
sion on this matter for several
months.” i _ ,

Women students at Duke Uni-
versity have been allowed a 2
a.m. curfew by the administra-
tion, while freshmen women at
the University of Oklahoma are
struggling for a 10 p.m. permis-

. sion.

GSPIA Sponsors Program

A six-week course in advanced
techniques in economic planning
began last week at the University
and it is conducted by 25 officials
fro-m the United States and over-
seas.

-The course, “Applied Quantita-
tive Techniques in Sectoral Plan-
ning,” designed for economic
planners, policy makers and ad-
ministrators, is being held at the
Graduate School of Public and

  To Study Economic Planning

International Aﬁairs (GSPIA).
The program will demonstrate
how quantitative techniques, us-
ing electronic computers, can be
applied to actual problems in ed-
ucation, public health, transpor-
tation, and other phases of na_-
tional and sectoral planning.

Dr. Abdul Khan, associate pro-
fessor in‘ the Department of Eco-
nomic and Social Development,
is conducting the program.

v,Exam Policy

I SUPPOSE most people
believe _that the primacy of
education is the learning pro-
cess itself. To me, the suc-
cess,_.of the educational pro-
cess depends upon a ‘ﬂowing
cooperation between the stu-
dents and the faculty. Con-
sequently, the concept of
=“fair play”. is essential to
the ultimate success of -any

educational institution. V
 The University is no ex-

ception C to the conception
‘_“fair play.” It pleases me to
say that this concept is gen-
;erally followed at the Uni-
 versity.
. However, it was recently
.-brought to my attention that
 this rule was being drastical-
ly broken by .a member of
-the University faculty. This
j particular professor brought
-{fourth a policy concerning
 ‘examinations which I believe
to be terribly unjust. It
‘ seems that this professor be-
.. lieves that it is his right to
‘schedule unannounced major
exams. » ’

expect a major exam which

Certainly no governmental system will ever be perfect in every way
 and no one would claim that our present Selective Service System is with-

_ The commission has suggested that the local draft boards should be

Personally, I think that
the objectives of an unan-

reverse themselves. First, it
is not the students job to
study continuously in one
subject. I think it is essential
for the professor concerned
to realize that his course is
not the only course offered at

the University and that stu- ‘

dents simply don’t have the
time to study continuously
in one subject.

SECONDLY, I don’t feel
that a student who attends
college should be so responsi-
ble as to be prepared for an

examination at any date_. No-'

body can study that much.
Finally, an unannounced
examination will eradicate
cramming for tests. But at
the same time it will disgust
students to such an extent
that they will shy away from

The commission says that the selections under the proposed system

would be “clearand binding.” It appears there would be no right of appeal.
One of the most democratic aspects of the present system is that cases are
heard by the local board and needs of individuals could explain why they
should be permitted to remain civilians.

Ultimately we do not feel that students should be submitted to this

It is unfortunate that all
the consequences of an unan-

the student to become totally
disinterested in the course he
is taking. The consequence
of academic disinterest re-
sulting from an unjust exam-

stantiated. A number of stu-
dents taking the course with
the unannounced examination
policy have complained to

me. The general sentiment
was that the constant pres-

developed an apathetic atti-

. CAN ANY University pro-
fessor be contented when a
great number of his students
have developed total apathy
towards his course. In my
opinion, a professor is a man
who is keenly interested in
student needs and student
education. Apparently,
professor in question does
not share my view.

I urge you sir, to re—eval-
uate your examination poli-
cy with respect to student in-

a professor is a man who be-

Reader Criticizes Viet A Column
For Use of -‘Illogical,’ Reasoning

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to comment on the
column written by Ivan Abrams
in Mondays’ Pitt News. Mr.
Abrams seems to believe that
since the U.S. uses a certain type
of weapon in Vietnam, napalm,
the University community
should’ve refrained from attend-
ing I a ROTC sponsored social
event, the Military Ball. This rea-
soning is so illogical as to be al-
most ludicrous. Yes, na-palm kills
and maims. But so does artillery,
grenades, riﬂes, pistols, knives,
garrotes, mines, pungi sticks,
rocks, and even bare hands. Na
palm does it a bit more efficiently
thereby saving Allied lives. Is
this wrong? Mr, Abrams how-

ever, did make some _other state-_

ments that deserve to be ex-
amined a little more closely.

For example, he states, “there
can be no conceivable basis ei-
ther for our original or continued
involvement in this civil conﬂict.”
Obviously Mr. Abrams does not
consider helping S. Vietnam and
the rest of Southeast Asia keep
free of military enforced com-
munist domination a “conceiv-
able, basis” for our involvement.
Fortunately, many of us do. As
for___,,&_t~_l_1,e,,conﬂict being “civil,” I
gue°s's"Mr. Abrams considers the

25 plus N. Vietnamese main line. .
battle regiments now in the South.

as mere tourists. He also says,

.“..  the Viet Cong are civilians.”

Surely, he has a strange concept
of what constitutes a civilian.
Does he ‘think the V.C. platoons,
companies, battalions, and regi-
ments, most well equipped with

—modern weapons, are mere fra-

ternal organizations? I suppose
their multitudinous attacks on
villages, their mass kidnappings,
their large scale assasinations and
terrorist activities are‘ just the
boys letting off a little steam af-
ter a hard day in the rice pad-
dies. Mr. Abrams asserts, quite
correctly, that the U.S. is “the
c-nly "nation in the world using
napalm.” What he fails to men-
tion is, besides the Egyptians in
Yemen (who apparently only use
poison gas), the U.S. (with its
Allies) is the only major nation
presently involved in an open
conﬂict. It’s like saying a certain
halfback was the leading scorer
in a game without mentioning
the score was 6-0 and he was the

_ only one to score. He goes on to

claim we failito provide medical

aid for those accidently injured
in battle. ,1-Ie later equivocates by

saying there are “some” medical
teams treating Vietnamese. Well,
besides the thousands of Ameri-
can military medical personnel,
there are over 200 volunteer ci-
vilian physicians" from this coun-
try serving the Vietnamese peo-
ple. These medics and doctors,
both civilian and military, treat
not only war wounds, but also
the diseases and malnutrition that
have plagued these unfortunate

people for centuries. They have

brought modern medicine to
where none ever existed before.

Finally, Mr. Abrams states that
415,000 civilians have died “from
the effects of the war since 1964.”
Surely, the V.C. and‘ N. Vietna-
mese have played some part in
producing those casulaties. It is
not the Americans who set off
terrorist bombs in the middle of
civilian crowds in Saigo-n. It is
not the Americans who use inno-
cent Women and children as
shields for an attacking force. It
is not the Americans who assa-

sinated thousands of teachers, 

mayors, and other civilian gov-
ernment types (with their 1ami-
lies) last year.

,Mr. Abrams seems to forget
that it takes at least two to ﬁght
a War, and that in a war, Vietnam
or any other, people, innocent
people, will suﬁer. It just can’t
he helped. Mr. Abrams is very
concerned with the sufferers of
this war. But I am even more
concerned with the many more

- millions of sufferers of the fu-

ture and dirtier wars that will
surely result if we are not reso-
lute today in Vietnam.

Miami s ‘Defense’ Ends Year
Unhappily

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Assistant Sports Editor

Miami of Ohio has one of
the top defensive basketball
teams in thecountry, but ac-
cording to Panther coach Bob
Timmons, they get outside

help.
At least they did Saturday

I when Miami’s Redskins toppled

the cagers, 82-68. It was bad.‘

enough that the defeat ended the

season at 6-19 for the Panthers,

one’ more and two more losses
' over last year.

But the kind‘ of game made
the outcome worse. “It could
have been a good game,” said
Timmons, “but the officiating
hardly made it interesting.”

The referees called 23 personal
fouls on the cagers, “You -don’t
mind poor officiating if it shows
up atboth ends of the court,” he
pointed out. “But the officials

' there worked one way only.

“Miami has an aggressive, press-
ing defense,” he continued, “and
they hang right on ‘top of you.
We were getting npthing called.
On our side, we were in. a zone
that wasn’t particularly aggres-
sive, and we -couldn’t touch them
without getting a whistle.”

Jim LaValley had two fouls on
him in the opening minute. When
he reached four early in the sec-
end half, Timmons, took him out.
“After sitting on the bench, Jim
saw precisely what was happen-
ing on the ﬂoor,” revealed Tim-
mons.

LEN KALATA ended his sophomore year Saturday against Miami of

Ohio by scoring 15 points on’ seven of 14 from the field. Kalata aver-

aged just under 10 points a game for the/season with a high of 23

Swimmers End Season

With Loss To Falcons;

Colorado Air Too Thin

by JAY KAPLAN

If anybody Wants to know how the high altitude will
affect the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, just ask’ any mem-
ber of the swimming team. They met Air Force in the Fal-
cons home pool and the thin air was just too much as they
lost, 66-38.

Gary Martin was the only standout performer for the
mermen as he took firsts in the 50 yard freestyle and the 100 yard
freestyle and swam the ﬁrst leg in the winning 400 yard freestyle
relay. But the 7250 ft. altitude took its toll on the mermen in all
events over 100 yards. They just couldn’t breathe.

The swimmers knew the thin air would affect their performance,
but they did not know by how much until after the first event, the

V 400 yard medley relay. Air Force set a new school record of 3:43.23,

beating the mermen by over 16
full seconds. After the race, they
must hung onto the ropes grasp-
ing for air.

The 200 yard freestyle pitted
Air Force’s John Graham against
John Lane. Lane did the best he
could but it wasn’t enough as
Graham won the event by only
a second.

In the 200-yard individual med-
ley, Chris Price had more to go

When one of the referees came
within earshot of the eager bench,
La-Valley mentioned to him that
it would be nice to call the same
way for both teams. The official
didn’t think the advice was ap-
propriate and threw LaValley off
the bench and out of the game.

Thus LaValley’s last collegiate
appearance was shortened con-
siderably. A

Suffer Tenth Loss

Decision at 145 Costly as  
Wrestlers Drop Final Meet

by R03; JACOBS
Saturday was a pretty disappointing afternoon for

‘ everyone involved with the Wrestling team. Maybe coach
’ Dave Johnson was the most disappointed of all as he Watch-

ed his team lose its tenth meet in twelve attempts.
But to some of the wrestlers there was an aura of help-

V_ lessness around their 18-14 loss to Syracuse.
“We needed the first four weights to Win,

77

reminded

123 pounder Rich Shildt. “We missed at 145, and that’s What
cost the meet. The way everything was paired, all we could

do was sit and watch what we
knew would happen.”

The victim at 145 was Cliff
Zolinkoﬂ:'. He lost his match in
the last 15 seconds when Syra-
cuse's Kevin Raftery put him on
his back.

Up to ‘that point the matman
had achieved all they were sup-
posed to. Rich Shildt won at 123,
Larry Cuba gained a forefeit at
130, and Ron Schuchert closed a
winning season with a 4-1 deci-
sion at 137.

Shildt won his match, 5-2, over
Lee Manns. After a scoreless ﬁrst
period and a minute and a half

I of the second period, Shildt es-

caped and took Manns down.
Manns then escaped at the end
of the period to come’ within 3-1.

Shildt managed a predicament
while on top in‘ the last period,
but Manns escaped for his ﬁnal
point.

Terry Hoover was the only

other winner for the varsity, but.

despite his own performance he
felt, “we just wrestled a poor
match. We should have won.”
With some clutch wrestling,
Terry managed a 5-4 win over
Cliff Ensley in the 177 pound
class. There was little action in
the ﬁrst period because Ensley
wou1dn’t tie up with Hoover, and

\in fact there wasn’t a takedown

in the whole match.
‘ However, in the second period,

everything,” praised Timmons.
“The ‘kids were upset and they
got fed up with the whole mess,
but they played well anyway. Len
Kalata and Ken Bollens gave us
good games. I started Kalata in-
stead of Steve (Stevenson) and
he had 15 points. Bollens scored
13 and played well under the
boards.

“We outrebounded them,” he
added. “Bollens and LaVa.lley,
while he was in there, both had
nine.” I

The Panthers started the game
off well, grabbing a 4-0 lead. But
soon after, the trouble started.
“LaValley drew a charging foul
after making. the basket,” des-
cribed Timmons. “Then one of
Miami’s players drove into La-
Valley and the call went the
other way."

Redskin coach Taylor Locke
spoke to Timmons after the game
and conceded that the officiating
was poor. But it was a small con-
solation, .

At halftime, Miami led 39-30,
with Phil Snow pacing their at-
tack. The 5’8” guard had 12 of
his 23 points in the ﬁrst half.
Teammate Fred Foster contri-
buted‘ 16 of his 22 points in the
second half to keep the Redskins
out of reach.

“They have two good ones in
those boys,” Timmons noted. “We

knew we’d have to stop them, '

and we didn’t.”
I The win was Miami’s fourth

straight over the Panthers and-

increased their edge in the series

to 9-2. Miami ﬁnished its'ﬁrst sea- v

son under Locke at 14-10.

For the cagers, their 19th loss
added to the dubious record they
had broken earlier. No Panther
quintet had ever lost more than
17 games in one season before.

Theta paced its sprinters to cap-
ture the “B” League crown last
Tuesday and Thursday at the

Delta Sig totaled 52‘/2 points in
the “A” section. Delta Tau Delta

eight in the long horse vault

pete at the nationals. Last year,
Shidemantle ﬁnished ﬁfth at the
nationals in this event.

The only other gymnasts who
came close to qualifying were
co—captains Jim Sacco and lg
Perez. For the third straight year
Sacco placed ﬁfth in the Olympic
all-around division missing quali-
fying for the nationals by one
place. Teammate Ig Perez ‘ﬁnish-
ed sixth in the all-around divi-
sion.

Also for the second straight
year, Penn State won the East-
ern championships, edging out
Springﬁeld Coll_ege.,Ear1ier in the
season Springﬁeld beat Penn
State, remaining in ﬁrst place
throughout the season. However,
Penn State wound-up in a. tie for
ﬁrst with Springﬁeld in their
overall record and both will rep-
resent the East in the champion-
ships".

In individual competition, no-
body came close to All-American
Steve Cohen who won three of
the seven events. He was ﬁrst on
the ﬂoor exercises, parallel bars,
and still rings and won in the all-
around division. Last year Cohen
held two national championships.

Season Ends Tonight
For Freshman Cagers

by MIKE BROURMAN
The curtain rings down on collegiate basketball in the
city tonight, and the freshman cagers will play one of the

leading roles.

They meet Point Park at the Civic Arena at 6:15 p.m.
in the last scheduled game this year. The contest will be a
preliminary to the NBA game between the Philadelphia

76’ers and the Los Angeles Lakers.

Point Park enters the game
with a 16-6 record and one of
their defeats was an 82-79 over-
time loss to the Cubs. They will
no doubt be looking for revenge.

Quite a different goal is in the
minds of Tim Grgurieh and the
Cubs. They carry a 13-4 record
into the game and a win over the
Bisons will tie them with the 1955
team as the winningest freshmen
in Pitt history. That team later
went on to two NCAA tourna-
ments.

Standing in their way will be
the formidible opposition of Ron
Brown, Lee Snyder, Bob Miller
and company.

The 6’4” Brown leads the Bi-
scns in scoring with a 19 point
average, the same ﬁgure he hit
against the frosh at the Field
House. Snyder, a 6’6” junior, was
held to 12 in that game but aver-
ages 17.

‘ ...W|llil'li il Slllililillllﬂll liill‘8lil‘ Illiililﬂllllllilll P
illlll liiil‘W l'8Sllllll8l|ll|llI. - '

Miller was the biggest thorn
in the Cubs’ side that night. He
hit on his first ten shots from
the ﬁeld, all long jumpers, and
ﬁnished up with 23 points.

Rounding out the starting five
for Point Park are guards Grant
Werle and Hank Nerone. Nerone
just recently cracked the starting
lineup, replacing Brent Lake, and
according to Grgurich is “a good
ballplayer.’’ \

Playing their last games, at
least as freshmen, will be the
Cubs, starting ﬁve of Charlie
Hunt Hunt, Mike Patcher, Rob
McFarland, Bob Petrini and Dick
Hassinger. Petrini, McFarland and
Patcher are the leading scorers.

The bench, which Grgurich
credits with so much of the Cub’s
success, will also be on View for

the last time.
