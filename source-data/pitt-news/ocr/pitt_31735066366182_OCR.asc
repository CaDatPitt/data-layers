. gard to this fee, continuation of it to be based on the results
achieved in student morale, enrichment of student activity pro- v
grams, "responsible student participation in the allocation of
the fund, and responsible student handling of funds allocated
to various activities; ' - , >

> That moneys made available for student activities
through this fee supplement, not replace or reduce currentior
future University appropirations for student activities;

,4 > That a special committee be formed to make the allo-

:1 cations, the committee to be composed of two students selected

r‘ by the Student Affairs Committee, two students selected by

Student Government, the Financial Adviser to Student Activ-

ities, and the Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs as chairman;
‘ > That the allocations recommended by the committee be ’

presented to Student Government for ‘approval. . i v >

We recognize the authority of the senate of the Studen )
Government to veto the committee recommendations and send ,
them back to the committee for re-consideration. We recognize :
also that ﬁnal authority rests with the Vice-Chancellorfor Stu- v
dent Affairs.

We assume further that, before the committee begins its ’
deliberations on the allocation of funds, it will prepare for
approval of Student Government and for, publication in the ,
:1 fitt News, a detailed/"outline of the policies andprocedures to
M be followed by the committee and by the organizations re-
,4 questing‘ funds.

" We believe the idea of a Student Activities fee meets the

H approval of the student members of the 1964-65 Student Af-

,4 fairs Committeeas well as our. own. Through the student lead-

,, ers represented on both committees we believe the desire for

:1 such a fee meets the approval of student leaders generally.

;< The details of the above recommendations have been worked

" out by the student members of the 1965-66 Student Affairs

’‘ Committee, working with a group of leaders from Student

 Gets Nowhere o Allocations Problem

Referendum Motion
Gains. Little Support

Student Government (SG) defeated a proposal last
Thursday night calling for a student referendum to decide
the manner of allocating the Activities Fee funds. The refer-
endum proposal was a reaction to a statement made‘ by
Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs Helen Rush at a Student
Affairs Committee-meeting four hours before the SG meet-

ing.

,.Vice-Chancellor Rush declared
SG’s creation of an appropria-
tions committee and selection of
its ﬁve members at_the Septﬂ 16
meeting “unacceptable in spirit
and in fact. The committee as
originally constituted in the re-

‘quest to the Board of Trustees

through Dr. Rankin and the
Chancellor must stand. Although
the resolution passed by the
Board did not repeat the details
of the student composition of the
committee, the signed student re-
questiattached thereto clearly in-
dicates their intention,” she ex-
plained.

Vice-Chancellor Rush asked the
Student Affairs Committee to
name two members to the A110-
cations Committee. The group se-
lected Dorrie Brand, one of the
ﬁve students elected by SG the
week before, and Ralph Mann-

‘ing.’ Student Government was "

still to have the right to appoint
two members. ,
SG President Eric Stern an-

nounced to the senate that he‘

does not “ever intend to return

to a Student Affairs meeting.”-

After uring the senators to take
action, Stern was disappointed by

their defeat of the referendum.’

He described himself as being
“very upset by the extreme lack
of faith in the student ‘body ex-
pressed by the senators" rejec-
tion of the referendum.”

In support of the referendum,
Senator Richard Shweder said:
“If the students don’t support
Student Government, Student
Government should not exist.”

Herefused to be a “rubber stamp «

of the administration.”

In opposition, Senator Richard
Thuss claimed that a referendum
would only hurt SG. Marty En-
gels stressed that the effects of
creating an appropriations com-
mittee were more important to
the students than the principles
behind it. “The fact is,” as Sen-

' ator Roy Meckler put it,“ Stu-;

dent organizations need money

once, in essence theory-making.

This differs qualitatively from.

the other levels ixrthat the com-
ponents distinguishing it are ab-

solute — a necessity for scientific .

communication.

While investigating experience

' and behavior the psychologist is

forced to consider separately
these aspects of living which are
in ‘reality inter-related. In this
investigation scientiﬁc method _is

‘and they need it now” ,They felt
that a referendum would only dye-j

In further action, at the four A
and a half hour meeting, the Sen-
ate moved to reconsider the pro-
posal to set up an SG-controlled,
Appropriations Committee -— a
proposal originally passed" in‘,
April and amended Sept. 16. The
motion was ruled out-of-order‘
when Senator John Ruskay dis-2
covered that a. matter for recon-
sideration must be brought upat,

sideration of the April Approprias 1%
tions Committee resolution._ The "
motion, introduced by’ Senate,
Jim Janis, fell slightly short‘ of

to pass it. ‘ ' . "

speech which Jim Smith attempt-

resigning his position as chair-

allowed to complete the speech.

I speak tonight to all who have
‘ gathered in this room—-not to the
Progressives and not to Able and
not to independents but to rep-
resentatives of a segmentof the
University.

I have worked for three and
one-half years for the student
_ activities .and the students of
this University. I have not al-
ways succeeded but I feel in my
 mind that I did my best and I
-would not make any attempt to
do anything over again. i

In this light, I feel that I have

I and enthusiasm because if it were
A not for you there would be noth-
ing for us activities majors to do.

-much more important which I
feel you should all understand.
 We have been engaged in a
, rather heated disagreement be-
tween students and administra-

ntivities fee. There have‘ been
(charges and counter charges
zwhich have clouded the main

At this time I would like to

sue. We are .all students at this
University and accordingly must
accept the fact this University
will act without us in four years.
It has gone on for over 150 years
and will probably be here 150
more.

Let us keep upper most in our
minds that the only constant
thing here are the rules, regula-
tions and personnel which carry
on the traditions of our educa-
tional society. We may disagree
and rightly so but in many cases
our demands and questions are
met and answered. Many times
we are disappointed but if we
think and honestly appraise our
ideas we are more than likely
to ﬁnd that we can see the rea-
sons why we .are turned down.

This student activities fee is
the most important single idea
that the students on this campus
have dared to undertake. In fact
I dare say it is unique among
student activities subsidation.

There are, however, certain
aspects of gov‘ernment that we,
and I use the term we encompass-
ing all of us in this room, must
respect and always keep in mind.
They are personal values which
must be relegated for the good
of the tnire body and I dare sug-
gest that there are a few in this
room who have forgotten this and
represent opinions other than the
majority of the student body as
a whole. It has been suggested
by some which I will not render
an opinion on that these few
may be influenced by outside
sources. I hope that this isnot

, the case. The second principle

which I feel we should remem-

ber is the respect for others and."

their opinions: We each have

opinions about this issue but we
must remember that we must de-
bate issues and not personalities
and their position.

In this regard let me comment
that too much criticism has been
leveled against Vice-Chancellor
Rush. She has been referred to as
she, her, the administr.ation all
of which are to say the least dis-
respectful and I charge is wholly
unfounded. She is not the admin-
istration and neither are we. Her
contribution is more than all of
us together. If you have any
ideas like that thenyou are in
the wrong room. Thereis no rea-
son why an individual should be
forced out of discourtesy to be
subjected to such charges. Her
policy has been clear and unal-
tered and it is a shame that as a
body we have to express opinions
that ceretainly would not be lev-
eled to anyone in person. I hope
that you will follow the directive
which will be discussed tonight.

Ladies and gentlemen of the
senate, you have a responsiblity
to the students of the present
year but more importantly to
the student of the future._You
must act quickly and for the
sake of these students. They do
not care who allocates or why:
all they can see is that organiza-

‘ tions are ﬁghting among them-

selves for control of something.
All they want and all they de-
serve is action which will give

been a bickering bunch of kids
that even though we demand
power and responsibility we cer-
tainly are unqualiﬁed to handle
it. Our body lacks courtesy, re-
spect, and fails to remember who
elected them. If a body presents
programs that are logical, clear
.and can demonstrate need then
there is no reason why any or-
ganizations power has to be lim-
ited to their constitution. You
must reexamine yourselves and
decide if you wish to remain a
party to this typé'of action. I was
criticized for taking a position
with this body, in fact I lost a
number of close friends, but I
felt that as students we are rea-
sonable and intelligent and can
sit down and come to a decision
without reproach. I have worked
all summer and this fall with
this in mind. But I will not sit
idly by and watch this body tear
apart a university .and its stu-
dent activities. I will do every-
thing in my power to report and
help the students of this Uni-
versity to ﬁnd out the truth about
this issue and to- vocalize their

ideas. I feel that I can do much l

more for the students of this Uni-
versity without being a member
of this body and consequently:
and if you think the responsible
students will allow this action to
continue then you better think
again. You, senate, have killed
Student Government.

Not all these people agreed to
Thursday’s reaffirmation of the
[committee structure by Vice-
Chancellor Helen Rush. Two
changes were Bill Cabin being
editor of The Pitt News and Arla
Jean Anderson signing .as presi-
dent of Engineering and Mines
Cabinet.

Stern walked out of the meet
ing and,‘ did not sign the state-
ment. He said, “The meeting‘ is
being held under my protest and
that of the 800 students who
elected me. (Stern received only
701 votes ‘in last year’s election.)

By walking out of the Student
Affairs meeting, Stern further
compounded the confusion and
iron)’. On April 12, 1965, he,

-speaking as the spokesman of SG,

said that SG had vetoed a prior
bill and agreed  the SG bill
dated April 9 (see boxes page 1

‘E and 3).

It was realized this month
that Stern had misrepresented
the SG, and had not consulted
them. In fact, they had not vetoed
anything, and felt bound by their
original bill calling for an Ap-

I should like to take this opportunity to inform‘ you that

reason for vetoeing this bill is that the most recent recommenda-

SG on Sept. 16 ago reaffirmed
this desire to have the ﬁve mem-
ber bill hold. But because ofthe
“context of personal, informal
comments,” according to Miss
Rush, which had clouded the en-
tire issue since April, she used
her due authority to declare the
SG motion unacceptable.

No action can be taken until
SG decides its next move. They
did not come to a conclusion on
this issue last Thursday.

and the Activities Fee. Both have
.already been endangered. (The
Activities Fee was approved on
.’a, trial basis year by the Board
of Trustees.)

. The issue has been unresolved
since March. Since then, it has‘
been perpetual confusion. The
SG President has made illegal ac-
Ttions, there have been false
charges and countercharges, and
an unfruitful philosophical de-
bate.

Student Government demanded
‘its right to administer the fee.
Yet, it abdicated. that right by
failing to act in the student's
interests.

' Student Government demanded
it was the sole governing body
of the students. Yet, it abdicated
that right by allowing the debate
.to regress to a personalistic level.
.Student Government demanded
it was mature. Yet, it disproved
‘the existence of maturity by act-
ing like a crowd of naive and
restless juveniles.

Student Government can no
‘longerydemand anything. It is not
on a pedestal having omnipotent
._ power to wield at its leisure. It
has failed to prove its ability to
handle a major piece of legisla-
tion.

Student Government must now
reevaluate itself. It must rise
from its vacuum of innocence
and make internal changes be-

The administration has /been forced to do Student Gov-
. ernment’s work. SG was given time to act responsibly, it
; didn’t, and there was no alternative. ’

5 If the issue would have been left in SG any longer, Stu-
, dent Govermnent would have completely destroyed its image

fore wishing to reassume the gov-
erning of the student body.‘
First, Senator Rick Schweder

‘ should either resign or be asked

to resign by the Senate. He advo-
cates the conﬂict theory. The only
way for social change, he says, is
to operate outside the legal frame-
work. Be militant, don't compro-
mise, and attack the social sys-
tem.

He has reneged on hiS\ oath
taken as a SG Senator. He’ wishes
to operate outside the system;
For his satisfaction and for the
good of Student Government——
put him there..

Second, SG President Eric
Stern should be publicly chas-
tised by the Senate. He has vio-
lated the SG Constitution by act-
ing contrary to the will of the
Senate.- He has misrepresented
their legislation, and created con-
fusion. -

He has’ been indecisive, con-
tradictory, and oblivious to his
rightsland responsibilities as SG
President. His credibility is nill.

If he is not willing to alter his
behavior to meet the responsibil-
ity he has assumed, he should
not be tolerated. He has already
violated the Senate's trust, the
administration's trust, and the
students’ trust. No more can be
allowed.

Editor, The Pitt News:

As an erstwhile student of Ox-

to compare the different attitudes
of the authorities towards the
moral welfare of the students in

In Oxford, girls are allowed to

a strict "university rule that no

former leniency produce any‘ no-
ticeable rise in the illegitimate

sonable to suppose that this re-
versal of leniency and restric-
tion has as little effect on the
actual behavior of students? But
the restriction does have the un-
desirable effect of preventing the
development of mature and re-
sponsible relations between the
sexes from there can be no re-
sponsibility without freedom and
there can be, no maturity in a
relationship which is perforce

.. perpetually in the public eye or at

best half hidden from it by one
of the Tower supports. /

The problem of alcohol is more
difficult in that the state forbids
it to minors, but could not an
expection to the present strict
rule be made in the case of grad-
uate students who must .all be
over the legal age? After all
alcohol is not bad in itself; it is
only an excess of, it which is
bad and again how are students
to develop a responsible attitude
to it when they are so restricted
that they must resort to one‘. of
the local bars for a .guilt-ridden
drink, instead of being able to
invite their friends for a glass of
sherry before dinner. .

I hope youlwilllforg/ive these
minor criticisms by a foreign

their prime responsibility. The
allocations problem is no longer
their problem. They have failed
to serve the students and must
accept the committee’s decision.

’The most lucrative area of
service to the students has al-
ready been abused. But there re-
main other areas of challenge for
SG responsibility.

Housing rules, the book store,
the libnary system, the parking
dilemma, and the security prob-
lem. SG’s own legal framework
must be revised, the University
Handbook should be reevaluated,
and the relation between Student
Government, the Student Affairs
Committee, and the Vice Chan-
cellor for Student Affairs should
be put in clear perspective.

Fourth, the potential of the
Senate must be put to use. Many
senators must stop being mere
“yes” men, following the block
vote systern. Many must realize
the facts instead of voting on
emotions. Many Vice-Presidents
must voice their group’s view.
All must learn parliamentary
procedure. 3

The problems exist, the Sen
ate has potential, but the leader-
ship must be found. Eric Stern
has shown he is not the person
to lead. The Senate must fulﬁll
its responsibilitywith or without,

(Edz'tor’s N ate: The following
is the" text of an address pre-
sented to the student members
of the Student Affairs Com-
mittee last Thursday by Vice‘
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Helen P. Rush.)

In order that there be no

misunderstanding of what is
said, I am reading my state-
ment today. I shall leave a
copy with you; I have a copy
on ﬁle. It is my hope that t-his
procedure will lift the discus-
sion of the Allocations Com-
mittee and the rights ‘and
privileges of Student Govern-
ment and the Student Affairs
Committee out of the context
of personal, informal com-
ments to the basic issues in-
volved. Anything less than
that is unworthy of University
men and women.

The faculty and administra-
tive members of this Com-
mittee met yesterday. I called
them together and you sep-
arately because it seemed we
might make more progress if
the students who alone signed
the request for the activities
fee meet alone as they take
the next step. ,

Since the Student Affairs
Committee is advisory to me
as Vice Chancellor, I told
some Student Government
Senators who ‘protested our

-having any part in naming
students to the Allocations
Committee that I would com-
promise by asking you to nom-
inate, rather than select, your
two committee members. Stu-
dent Government, I agreed,
could accept or reject ‘these
nominations. I agreed also that
Student Government could es-
Ktablish the qualiﬁcations for
student membership on the
Committee. I made these con-'
’ cessions to indicate my faith
in Student Government.
, To date I have had no offi-
cial report from Student Gov-
ernment. Through The Pitt.
News, through the informal
comments of some members
of the Senate and of the ad-
visors, I have learned that
Student Government voted by
a large majority to accept the
compromise plan. At a later
meeting they reversed that ac-
tion and reactivated an ear-
lier bill which put the selec-
tion of the student members

of the Allocations Committee
wholly in charge of Student
Govrnment, ruling that their
President’s declared veto of
the former measure was ille-
gal. They then elected ﬁve
student members to the A110-
cations Committee. The names
have not been given to me,
but informal reports’ indicate
that sever.al of them are in-
eligible to serve.

This action is unacceptable
in spirit and in fact. The com-
mittee as originally constituted
in the request to the Board of
Trustees through Dr. Rankin
and the Chancellor must
stand. Although the resolution
passed by the Board did not
repeat the details of the stu-
dent composition of the com-
mittee, the signed student re-
quest attached thereto clearly
indic.ates their intention.

I therefore ask this student
group today to select its two
members of the Allocations
Committee. To avoid further
complications, your selection
will now be ﬁnal. I ask the
three Student Government
members present to take this
-copy of my statement to the
meeting tonight. It is their
privilege also to elect two
members. When I learn offi-
cially of the four choices, I
shall call the Committee to-
gether to begin work on allo-
cations.

May I remind both groups
that all students selected must
be scholastically eligible ac-
cording to the University stan-
dards as set forth in the Offi-
cial Handbook. May I also re-

mind all of you that privileges '
' and responsibilties of student

leaders and groups are clearly

deﬁned in that handbook. To .

quote the statement on page
ﬁve: “The policies and the

regulations in the pages that,

follow are based on the ex-
perience of many years in try-

ing to meet our broad educa- -

tional objectives. Individual
students and student organi-
zations, through their leaders,
are responsible for knowledge
of the policies and regulations
and for compliance with

v them.” All actions in any stu-

dent area must conform to the
regulations and policies there-
in outlined.

   Senate Names Profs.
  For Selection Group

‘-J

The University Senate
nominating committee has
named a group of twelve facf
ulty members from which
six men will be elected to aid
the Board of Trustees’ Exec-
utive Committee in the search
for a new chancellor. Final se-
lection of the committee will rest
with the full Senate,-said Dr.
Robert J. Agnew,_ chairman of
the nominating comfnittee. .

Dr; Agnew declined to make
public the names of the nomi-
nees until the entire faculty has
been informed. of decisions for
the ﬁrst time in the newspapers,”-
he explained.

According to Dr. George W.
Crouch, former secretary of the
Senate, “the erroneous notion
was put out that we were going
to appoint the committee at yes-
terday’s (Wednesdays) meeting-”'
Actually, the nominees were ap-
pointed by the nominating com-
mittee at last Monday’s meeting.

.Written ballots will be distri-

buted to the entire Senate for
ﬁnal voting.

At Wednesday's plenary ses-
sion the Sentae, which is com-

posed of all University faculty ~
with the rank of assistant pro--

fessorg or above, discussed the
possibility of revising the con-
stitution of the Senate in lsuchia
way as to give the faculty more
of a part in the administration
of the University.

Dr. Louis Johnston, vice-presi-
dent of the Senate, was appoint-
ed chairman of the ad hoc com-
rnittee which will draw up the
necessary measures. The propo-
sals will be submitted at the next
Senate meeting Oct. 22.

Dr. Johnston also chairs a com-
mittee which is considering the

feasibility of aproposal that the

Senate elect a member to the.

Board of Trustees. It has been
pointed out that this member
would be from outside the Uni-
versity, to dispel charges of self-A
interest on the part of the fac-
ulty. The proposal was made
during the Spring trimester by
during the Spring term by
the Division of the Natural Sci.
ences but was tabled by the Sen-
ate until the Fall.

Being Frank

by FRANK SMIZIK
Sports Editor

;. TOO MANY SOPHOMORES equals LOSS

A game under the belts of the Panther gridders was
enough to correct a few mistakes and bring a victory. The
defensive line didn't have any real lapses and for the most
 the offense could move the ball. Oklahoma Coach Gomer

‘nes gave indications that his team might have done better‘
,f_ they had also played the previous week.
“We had a lot of sophomores in the game and many of
hem had firsthalf jitters which cost us the ball game. I‘
V  we improved our play in the second half and made it
a better ball game. ’ ~
' " The speed of the Oklahoma line however, enabled _the
ooners to .run well. They gained a total 211 yards rushing,
:’i’it couldn’t move the larger Panther linemen inside the 20
ard lines. , _ _
“It was a typical Oklahoma team with a hard hitting
ast line that only differed from the great Oklahoma teams
precision,” said John Michelosen. ’ _
.§_..‘Michelosen was more pleased by ‘the way his boys 031"-
ed. out their own assignments. “I think we played a_ better
iafme this week.” The boys did a real ﬁne Job. »
f‘ The team did play better, but the scoring punch was
missing. Three times the gridders were withi-nrthe 20 Yard
“tie and couldn’t score. Although the defense has given HP
nly 26 points in two games, the offense has scored only 28.
., F Michelosen seems satisfied however, “I d0I,l:t care what
'1 he score is as long as we wind up the winners. _

- . with that philosophy Michelosen may make friends

hen he substituted Ed James for Lucas with the ball on

if iicas is ﬁrst string quarterback and that denotes superi-

,ty ‘over his replacements.
 7 “I just wanted to see what James could do in that situ-
on, and he almost did go all the way on that end sweep,”
aid. Michelosen.
, ‘ Naturally all the fans who weren't waving red Okla-
oina banners, were hoping that James would score, but
ost_couldn’t understand the replacement of the ﬁrst string
uaijterback when only leading by ten points.

 Ken Lucas mixed his plays very well and moved the
 up and down ‘the ﬁeld with his accurate -passing. like

The victory was an important one and may provide the
omentum for a winning season. Momentum and conﬁdence
important especially when a team is away from the

Opportunities and mis-

in college football and be-
cause of it the Panther rec-
ord _is now 1-1.

In the opening loss to Ore-
gon it was claimed that mis-

to inexperience; cost the gridders
the game. This past Saturday it
wasntheir turn, taking advantage
01 Oklahoma mistakes and win-
ning, 13-9. ‘ ‘

A young Sooner punter and
some costly penalties helped to
put the gridders out in front
and linebackers Jim Flanigan,
Josh Novogratz and defensive
end Phil Dohar did a lot to keep
them there. .

“We had a young team and we
knew we were going to make
msstakes,” said Oklahoma coach
Gomer Jones. “On any given day
one team can beat another and
Pitt's going to win their fair
share.” '
‘ The gridders’ ﬁrst scoring drive
in the second quarter was given
a big boost by a personal foul
charged against Oklahoma. In-
stead of a third down and ﬁve to
go situation, the penalty placed
' them on the Oklahoma 48 yard
line. Ten plays later quarter-
back Kenny Lucas passed. 22
yards to Eric Crabtree for the
‘first of his two aerial ‘touch-
downs. -

Later in the same quarter,
Oklahoma was faced with __a
fourth and 20 situation on their

, 14 yard line due to a 15 yard

holding penalty. Tom Stidham’s

punt .went off the side of his foot
and rolled dead on the Oklahoma

_ 28 yard line. Lucas passed three
straight times to end Mitch Zal-
nasky, the last one carrying eight
yards for the score.

Lucas’ arm was one of the few
offensive threats exhibited Satur-
day. He completed 12 of 22 at-
tempts for 148 yards. Crabtree

caught five of those for 72 yards.

“Pitt is going to move the ball
against anybody they play,” said
Jones. “They have a real good
passing attack. I don’t think Pitt

fans are going tocsee many shut-A

outs this year.”

Coach John Michelosen wasn’t
hazarding any’ guesses on his
part. “We’ve got eight more
games yet to play.” ’

Michelosen had good reason to
be hesitant about predicting fu-
ture Panther point spreads. On
three different occasions in the
second half the gridders were
within 25 yards of the Oklahoma
end zone with nothing to show
for it. --

“When we win I don’t care
what the score is,” said Michelo-
sen. ,

Helping to keep the Panthers
out of . trouble was the toe of
Andy McGraw. His ﬁve punts
averaged 44--yards, while this
counterpart, Stidham, only man-
aged a 29.9 average on seven
boots. '

Oklahoma is famous for its.
running game andit showed mo-

. ments of past glory in the sec-
ond half,’ gaining 147 yards on:

the ground. The day’s leading
gainer was Sooner Tommy Pan-
nell, who covered 82 yards on
15 carries. ' P

When penalties weren’t driv-
ing the Sooners backwards, Flan-
igan and Novogratz were. The
two corner linebackers were all
over the ﬁeld, jamming up holes.

Another problem the Oklahoma
offense had was right end Phil
Dahar. On one series of downs
in the ﬁrst quarter, the Sooners
had the ballron the Panther 22
after recovering Bobby Dyer’s
fumble. In two plays, Dahar per-
sonally pushed Oklahoma back
to the 44- yard line, dropping

quarterback John Hammond‘

twice.

Ed Assid, the, left defensive
end, was also breaking into -the
Sooner backﬁeld, ‘but the results
of his pursuit were negative.

“Assid was just outmanuevered
by a real good quarterback,” said
Michelosen. “The angle he was
coming in on‘ didn’t give him ‘a
good shot at the runner.” Evi-
dently Assid needs some lessons
in geometry from Dahar.

Offensive right guard Tom Qua-
ley injured his knee during the
game. ‘That was the onlyiinjury
reported, and the extent of in-
jury will not be known until
later in the week.

Ohio Univ. Wins

Pete Snyder, a sophomore who
Bemis played at halfback, saw

“Snyder showed he could play

Bemis. Snyder is 5”!” and weighs

just about scored on a break-

After the Rams ran the score
to 4-1, Bemis substituted Lou
Cepanec in the goal for Ed Zel-
nick. Cepanec held West Chester
scoreless for the remainder of the
third quarter and for the entire

— fourth quarter.

“After the fourth goal, I didn’t

Bemis. “He played just as well as

In Dorm League Encounter

Defending champion Keystone and second place ﬁnisher
Random House ‘both opened their Dorm league ‘seasons with
victories Tuesday afternoon at Schenley Oval, Keystone
walloped Litchﬁeld Manor,_ 30-6, While Random topped Tower
B floors 8, 9 and 10, 14-9, in extra innings. Hawthorne
House snared itssecond straight win, edging Playboy Pent-

house, 8-5.

_ Scoring in every inning, Keystone overwhelmed its op-
position with nine home runs. Greg Schultz and Craig Brown

each‘ hit two, and winning pitch-
er Rich Kaplan added one. -The
game was out of reach after a
seven run third inning. . ,.

Random House erupted for ﬁve
runs in the eighth to give Mike
Pagnotto a hard earned victory.
Lenny Fidre opened the inning
with a triple, and four singles
followed. Tom Allen of the losers’
forced the extra inning with a
homer in the sixth.

Steve Soh1oki’s three-runhomer

sibly a close race for the top
spot. Dave Eichenlaub, the num-
ber one runner came up with
severe chest pains and_.could not
compete. His absence hurt the’
team more than can be measured.

“The two factors which hurt
us the most were the real class
runners of both of the other
squads and the absence of Dave
Eichenlaub,” said coach Rees. “I
am inclined to believe that the
loss of Eichenlaub hurt more

gtlman anything. He is really ad-

mired by the other team mem-
bers not only for his ability, but
also ‘his leadership.”

All of the Panthers runners,
except for Hinchberger, were
slower than their regular times‘
for the course. Fran Shor, who
ﬁnished eighth, was 30 seconds
off his regular time, while Larry
Hubner and Frank. Handelman
were a full minute slower than
