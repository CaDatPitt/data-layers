Helps in Campaign
To Raise Interest
The Dean of Students ,Of—

ﬁce in conjunction with the

 student ‘senate committee on

student activities are present-

 ’  sending out" forms to 165

 ’_ campus organizationlvin order
to determine the problems these

groups will meet during the third .

trimester. ,

Ronald Pease, assistant Dean of
Men, urged that all organizations
return the formsrsent out, for the

‘f ” success of the program depends on

.'the, cooperation of the presidents
of all organizations. »

Pease stated that the Dean of 
Students is attempting to_work 

more. closely with all student or-

7 ganizations. They hope to increase

, interest in student activities, and
thus raise the campus moral.

\\ To help achieve this ﬁlial‘, the
committee on student activities
is planning to publish a book-
let to include information on all
campus activities, which they
hope to publish by nextlspring.

The committee may also begin

a leadersh_ip training program for

the fall. Members of the commit-

 tee are Marthe Hyslop, ' Warren

N‘ Clark, Sue Kufta, Francie Myers,

and Ray Reaves.. _

The activity of this committee is
an example of the efforts being
made to continue a.reasonably full
scaleeof activities for students dur-
ing the third trimester.

1 aDecides to Set  
fr Dance Early .

At the last Men’s Council meet-
ing for the present trimester, it
was unanimously decided that the
“Christmas Ball” be scheduled for
Saturday, December 10, 1960.

Council members felt that the
early date was necessary because
many students leave for home im-
mediately after the last class "be-
-fore the Christmas recess.

In past years, the dance was

*3. held on the evening after the last

A day of school, but because .most
students went home for the holi-‘
days, the dances were not well
attended. The last day of school
before Christmas will be Decem-
ber 22.

President Ron Miller reported
that a correction was made on
the number of new and trans-
fer students entering Pitt on
April 18. The new ﬁgure is set
at 53, not the previously re-
ported 35 students.

Finally, Council adjourned un-
til the resumption of regular
meetings in the fall. ‘During the

[The idea of freshman hazing has once again worked its

""y,ito the surface of suggestion. Actually, there maybe

, ,.cause for concern because the hazing idea arises period-

_ cally it issquelched. ‘
A I —Fortunately, this is one case where squelching has been

{the proper action to take. This sort of program, supposedly

?‘devised to create the espirit de'corp for which everyone‘
‘always’ is striving, disappeared from the Pitt campus ﬁve or

,six years ago. The last vestige of_the program appeared in-
» the form of the Pitt ties the freshmen were required to wear.

i lThe persons responsible for proposing the hazing plan

periodically believe they are doing the freshmen a great‘
uiservice; Although freshmen may not enjoy the program as

they go through it, the proposers say, they will look back

upon" it in later years with "fondness and appreciation.

V, :-"'_ Whether this “warm” feeling actually exists is difﬁcult
“to determine. In most cases, however, it seems doubtful.

I , In this most recent instance in which the program has
‘been dragged out of the bag of dead, unwanted traditions,

., the ‘prime movers have a clever new plan they think will
enable them to reinstitute hazing. I . »

" They intend to wait until the spring trimester begins,
then present the proposal to the Student Government Sen-
ate. Their strategy’ is this: with the reduced number of Sen-

atiirs. present next trimester, the “hazers” believe they will
be; able to “railroad” the plan through the legislative body.

The term “railroad” is theirs.

If the plan succeeds, the Senate will have taken one of

   

 

iiveirsity. --

I  If students wish to improve the attitude of their fellow
“students, there are better means by which to do_ it. These
frneans, however, are more difficult to devise than the simple
‘planof freshman hazing. Let these persons employ their
‘energies to create advantageous plans. Then _the university

Back and Forth . 

 Last Closing

. ‘By David Breakstone __

It is about time to close a door, Jay. Let’s
hope it doesn’t slam too hard, for everyone’s sake.
I have already mentioned general values and par-

. ,ticular merits of my four years at this “community

in transition,” as I chose, to call it two years ago.
You recall that at that time I ' »
was highly critical of -the uni-
versityas a place of learning. I
chose to look again at this vital
aspect of the school by way of
gently blowingout the footlights.

* In_ the best sense -the univer-
sity should act as a liberalizing
and liberating influence upon I
-students, _all students. Liberaliz-

panding horizons; liberating, as d A
enabling students to pursue those I ‘
horizons. These are the professed ideals of this
university. .There is, however, a curiousvgap be-

_ tween the dream and the fact. - -

The much trumpeted motto of the Renovators
is “academic excellence.” It is more’ trumpeted
than’ true. It conceals a multitude of"sins. We have

‘departments in the undergraduate ‘schools .which,

haveh’t “moved” in years. The dust, inertia, and
mediocrity which engulfs them and their beknight-
ed students is appalling. ‘ -

Plans Are Nice  . . ‘. ~ /1
There are grandiose plans for change on every

I desk,’ Precious little has actually been done. What,

for example ever happened, to curriculum re-
~vision? ‘ V - A ~

To improve the academic situation we have‘,
devised two types of ‘high-powered teams. There’

is, ﬁrst of all, the scouting party which is sent
out to attract “name professors” with ‘tantalizing
bait. The scouting party has not been singularly
successful: big names are wary of sn‘-_ares. '_

Too few young and vigorous men have been

- brought in. Unless the quarry is listed in the big

game manual, the scouting party doesn’t seem to
be interested. ' i I

, The second type of team‘ is the recruitment
squad whose job it is to capture razor-sharp grad-
uate_ students. They are more successful in their
quests, but the prizes still come mainly from sec-
ond-rank .-schools. - '

Male Tribulations . . .

Automation .|-ieiips I a

- By Ronald Burford
Last trimester I was forced by necessity to go to
a self service laundry.. These are not the boon to_'

the male college student that most people imagine-

Certain problems must be overcome to achieve any‘
success in using them. "

The ﬁrst problem is understanding the instruc-
tions‘ with a mere high school -A
and incomplete college education.
The directions are not written A
for ‘college students; they are
written for housewives.

For example a’ sign says,
“Yes! You may use your own
soap.” Since I had_n’t brought
any, I decided to use the box ,
that they provided. After using '
itgenerously, the lady who was

queried, “Where’s my soap?” -

She.was a nice lady. She didn’t even pal] the
manager. Shejust slopped met in the face with a
wet diaper. V J

The directions said, “Separate your clothes as
you usually do.” To housewives this means, “Sepa-
rate your clothes according to color”; to me it
meant, “Separate your clothes into small piles so
that you don": overloadithe machine."

Since I only had a few things, I decided to put
in together a few white shirts, a few white hand-
kerchiefs and two pairs of brilliant red socks. I
took out a few pink shirts, a few pink handker-
chiefs and two pairs of faded socks.
Interesting. but . . . . -

I became interested in the different washing
-cycles. This almost caused heart failure and it
did cause a lot of worry and speculation. ’

It started.out innocently enough. Periodically

I’d look under the lid and watch the sloshing action’

or the adding of .water. Once the. machine began
 to whine and vibrate. This_continued for a while

Starving Students -

And what of the undergraduate students them-
selves? Are they being challenged? Are they getting
so involved in their education that their intellectual
and spiritual lives are nourished by the. school’:
rbsources? Far too few are adequately fed,‘I think.

Most merely pick up the prescribed scraps. Do you

want evidence Jay?

Wh'at inducement is there to become a scholar
here, other than individual inspiration? Is there

an intellectual, vitally alive atmosphere? Is there 

keen scholastic competition? Is there sufﬁcient rec-E
ognition of good work? If anyiof these are ex-
istent, I.have not seen them. The encouragement
to excell is almost unheard of.. " .‘

There is‘ no standardization of a loose, unde-

lpendable grading system. There is noVdean’s list.

There is no'class ranking.’ The Honors Convocation

A

is a purely ceremonial affair, held to draw a big _:A
_-crowd to hear a publicized speaker. ‘

There are pitifully few’ academic prizes and

open competitions. The honors program for sen-5%‘

iors is almost without exception-a joke. It looks

. good only on_ paper. Original student work in their

respective ﬁelds is a rarity. We need a tutorial
system in the worst way for our idle, bright stu-
dents. In“ short, Jay, we are dabbling in excellence.
We are wasting our valuable time. ‘_

Andqyet the oﬁicials who can do something
about the singular lack of imagination here are

There is far to go before we sleep,’ Jay, before _
any of us who_have a committment to education

the fall and start shouting again, in the right places.

Ohio State Students
Want Miss LaRue

Editor, Pitt News:

On Thursday, March 24, we
visited an English 22 class taught
by Miss La Rue. Being from
Ohio State University, a mass-
education factory, we were ex-
pecting to View a class similar
tosome of our English courses.‘

That is, a large class, lectured

' to rather impersonally by a Pro-
fessér who, aloof from his stu-

dents, seemed eager to ﬁnish and .

pursue some other activity more
interesting to him.

However, on‘ the contrary, we
were delightfully surprised by
the excellent teaching methods
of Miss La Rue. Miss La Rue led

- the discussion, bringing each and
every member of the class into
it." ,

We were amazed‘ to see how

 eager the students were to par-

tieipate and, contribute to the
discussion. Her sincere interest
in the contribution to ,the

. “whole education of the student

was very appealing to us.

Her class was ‘truly education-
al, covering not only the requir-
ed" material, but bringing in

-.many illustrations from the em- V

pirical world. -

What-a change from the im-
personal, boringmethods of so

We are very sorry and sur-
' prised to hear that Miss La Rue
has i‘ been dismissed from the
University of Pittsburgh. We
have learned during the course
of our lifetime that the value of
some-things are never realized
v until those things, are’ no longer
available. I .
. May we say to you, Miss La
Rue, that when you graduated

Asks for Dismissal
Of ‘Phone’ Doctor \

iffilditor, . Pitt News:

Two ‘weekends ago, I was in-
volved in a most serious situa-

tion in which a member of the ‘
,’,University family was negligent
 "and failed to perform a duty.

_A freshman student, who is a

i . close friend of,mine, called me

. \

   

 Th ‘sam

, Saturday night and asked that
I get a doctor for’ him. He had
been sick for about 10 days and
wasn’t getting any better.

"He had seen'Dr. Carlson ear-

’ lier, but he received the “usual
treatment” from Doc. I told him

"what I would call a doctor right

away and proceeded to try to
_ try to_ ﬁnd the name of.an Oak-
land physician .who I had heard
I was reliable.
_, Being unable to do so, I called
A Jim Hutchison, 8th floorproctor
of Schenley House, who was on
' duty that night and explained
-the situation to him. “Hutch”
said that there is a dorm phy-
sician on call to take care of
cases just like this and he was

.,_ glad I had called him. He would ‘

‘get him right away. I called the
sick -student back and -told him
that “Hutch” would take care
of everything.

The next afternoon, Sunday, I

stopped byischenley to see this -

' student. He told me" ‘how
“Hutch” had come up to his
room a little after I called him,
and when they called the doctor,
he said tha,t‘he didn’t think it
was an emergency and therefore
not necessary to come; that he
would see~,him Monday evening.
'I was greatly annoyed, but I
decided that there wasn’t much

A ﬁnally been persuaded to come,

and had had an emergency op-
eration for the removal of his
appendix at 10:30.

It had ruptured and abcessed.

-His condition was only fair, but

it is better now.‘

The conclusion to this letter
shall be mild in comparison to

- what I feel. The conclusion to

this case shall not be mild. It is
ﬁne that the university hasisuch
excellent physicians. that they
can make a diagnosis over the
phone. But if much more time
would have ‘elapsed, ,the stu-
dent’s' conditionwould be much
more serious at the moment.
I call for an immediate in-
vestigation leading to the dis-
missal of said physician. The
health and lives of our students

. should not be in the hands of
‘such an incompetent man.

_ As an added conclusion, I
would like to say that in the
past three months, I, as just one
student, have seen and heard of
a lot of questionable action going
on around the university. ‘
May I go so far as to put it in
the form of a “threat” (as that
word was recently used inan in-
teresting way with me): if I

hear ofvone more thing happen--

ing around here which is not in
the best interest of the students
of this university, I shall devote
my efforts, now and after I
graduate, to the exposing of each
and everyone of them to the
public!

here and I want action. I hope

Grad ‘Assistant Says
He Enjoys Eating

khow. ' . '
At what university is the hir-

any level based ‘upon some cri-
terion of teaching ability?

‘Teachers are hired on the basis,

of their scholastic records, the
quantity of their research? re,-
ports, how they’ll ﬁt in with de-

who applies forthe job.

Who applies is determined -by
the availability of research fa-

and pay. Teaching ability is not
considered. ,

At this university, teaching
assistants do have more respon-
sibility than at other schools

College's Unacademic Life A. . . 2’

FromThreat to Threat to

_ By Murray Chess‘ _ .

Many personal unacademic incidents have oc-
curred during the past four years, some of which
were initiated by what I had to say on these pages,

others by what others had to say -— about me.
Engineers — fraternities — politics —— student
affairs -— athletes: these were_ ‘

some of the areas in which I
dabbled most.

Oneof the few areas at this
university which escaped the ‘ﬁg-
norant” typewriter, as some per-
sons have called “it, was the
women’s department. Perhaps
the only reason I never wrote
anything about the 12th ﬂoor,
that gloriﬁed tea party of recipes
and etiquette books, was that it
wasn’t important enough to
worry about. ~ " .

My first contact with the engineers came, after
the student elections in 1958_ when’ I wrote that
“we must remember to forget the slide-rule bunch
for future elections.”
same afternoon, about five _engineers
cornered. megangland-fashion in the small instru-

' ment room next to the Panther Room. After a few ’

questions which communicated’ their outrage to me,
one_of them barked: z

“You better watch it. You got‘ 15 hundred guys
gunning for you.” _ ‘ , _

Fortunately, none of those 1500 ever “gunned”
me. One came close, but I’m getting ahead of
the story. _ '
A Green Dean \.

My last friendly chat with an engineer occurred .

just a few weeks ago, prior to Engineers’ Week.
The fellow desired to "have page one of the Pitt
Always being right up
there with the fashions, of ‘the times,“I refused.

“But "you have to print it in green,” the nervous
chap said. “Our dean says it has to be in -green.
And our dean is a big man in this school.”

Fraternities next‘, please. Since these fellows
compare with the 12th ﬂoor in importance, one
incident will suiﬁce here. It was in October, 1958,
that I wrote abput the continual descendency of
Interfraternity Council. ‘ .

One particularly outraged and indignant indi-
vidual stormed into the oﬁice, warning me I" should
_take back what I said about the IF ,oﬁicers
being “simple.” ’ 2

The Blood Count 

By’ Tom -Bryant _
Every time I ' open the daily newspaper. or‘
glance through ‘a magazine, I usually read. of some-
onewho is moaning about the so-called “excessive
it’s the P.T.A.

violence” on television. One day
groups, the next it’s the parents,

then the critics, and so on to.
inﬁnity. .

Not being able to control my a
curiosity any further, I set out to '
compile my own “system, of rat- 
ings” to report the number of -
fatalities on TV during an aver- 
age week. The name - of this
unique system is “The ‘ B.100d 0.

Count.” ,   _.

    

The biggest task was to per-
suade a number of friends and .
relatives to patiently sit in front of their TV screens
and painstakingly count the number of murders,
stabbings, poisoning/gs, and hangings that ..they wit-
nessed. ' '

“The Blood Count” encompassed about 50% of
the night-time network programming during the
week of March 21 to March 27. Every type of pro‘-
gram was monitored, including adventure shows,
western, the private eyes, comedy-variety program,
panel shows and musical productions, sporting
events, and public affairs and‘ news programs.
Quite a Struggle ’ , i

A total of 40 programs were monitored during
the seven day period with an average of 1.3 fatali-
ties per show. Viewers for the survey struggled-_
through 28 hours of TV with a. ration of 1.8 deaths

-per hour. 2 v ,

The Era Nehru Begun. i 1
Student politics provided many stories. In 1958,
I was accused by the independent party of being
pro-fraternity party and the next year, the ace"
sations were reversed. Along with .the 1958 charg;
came the nickname of “Nehru.” They said it “we
supposed to mean that I claimed .1‘ was independent,
but that I really wasn’t. ‘That was the .ﬁrst.1a'bel-'

The student affairs area is pretty broad, in fact.
‘so broad that no one knows where it starts and’;

as an example. Here is’ _a group that is as am-'
biguous as the area itself. V

think the overlapping organization was broad‘
enough, so this year Dr. John Geise, assistant?

Bad Red Apples _ 
’ Sinceboth time and space’ are running “out, -,1’~.
will write a few paragraphsiabout my .,,favorite
university topic, the athletes. V  
From Nov. 28,1956, when I mentioned Arnie 
Sowell’s “frail, sweaty hands,” and Feb. 12, 1958,_,  
when I wrote about the football players’ ba-seball‘. 
game in the Student Union lounge, to the present’ 
controversy about red-shirts, I have had some sort
of fan club in reverse.‘ A  ._
There was the column about the dual role of ‘
Bob Timmons, the coverage that the soccer team
supposedly didn’t receive, a reader’s letter ‘about
Ken Montenari, a letter from an unsigned athlete.  
in return and of course the efﬁgial hanging of
John Michelosen. ' "

V One last point, if I may, concerning athletes. I _
do not condemn the group as afwhole, but there»

academic years I should leave a forwarding ad’.-‘T’

In the ' individual ‘show classiﬁcation, ABC's“.

‘ Classifying programs by types, the adventure.
shows (Riverboat, The Alaskans,‘ etc.) won with
a tremendous 3.42 deaths per show. Next were ;the,,5
westerns with a 2.86. Finally, in the third posi‘

An amazing record was recorded ‘by CBS. .:Q__
the ten programs monitored from that network“
only one fatality wasrecorded. (on Gunsmokéﬂ

36 for 23 programs.  .

The “Blood Count" reveals that amountof yio-Ii’:
lence one sees depends on which night the ob-‘1.
server watches television. The survey found ithej"

Wednesdays. Naturally, this factor will vary from},
week to week with different evenings presenting‘;
more violence thanothers. " '   

No one survey can accurately <determine,Vthe*"_

For those of you who enjoy the "process of

. There has been some talk from the.Pirate ofﬁcials that Forbes
Field could not stand the extra games the Panthers would play
‘there. This would certainly be true in April since the weather has
"not been kind to the ﬁeld, but by May the ﬁeld will be in good shape.

Panther followers got their

first glimpseof the 1960 edi-
tion of the Cats grid team last
Saturday. .
Although Coach John Mich-
-elosen seemed pleased with
the showing of the Blues 16-14
winsover the Whites, many view-
ers of the televised intra-squad
game question the Panthers power.
,Particular]‘y disappointing was
the showing of the Panther quar-
terbacks. Dave Kraus was the
only quarterback that looked
_ hopeful and even he made his
‘ mistakes and looked inexperi-
enced. .

‘ WHO WENT TO THE PROM—A«ND WHY 

“Hello,” said the voice on thetelephone. ‘,fThis is WertlicI_'il." A
Sigafoos.' I sit next to you in psych. I’n1 kind of dumpy and

I always wear a s\vo:1t slliI't.”

“I’m ufmid I don't remcmlier you,” said Anna Livia Plura-

' ‘belle. '

_‘ “I’m the one whose lecture notes you’ve been borrowing for 

two yo:11's,’.’ said \‘Ycrtlier., '

“Oh, yes!”  ‘Anna; Livia. “What do you wish, W:1lter?’} 
“ll'crtiher,"’ sf.1idWertl‘ler. “What I wish is to take you to the

Junior Prom neit April.”

_ “But this is November 27, Westnor,” said Ahna Livia-

'i‘ll"crlluer,” said Werther. “Yes,-I know, but you are so round
and beautiful that I was afraid you might have a date already.’5 ‘-

. ,“As a matter of fact Ido, Wingate,” said 'Anna'Livia.
.“Werthcr,” said Werther. “Oh, dratl”

Anna Livia did not really have a date, but she was ‘expecting 

to be asked by Stewart Stalwart, athletic and BMOC, handsome
as Apollo, smooth as ivory, wearer of faultless tweeds, smoker

of l\‘l:1rlboro cigarettes which even without his other achieve-
ments would stamp him as a man with know-how,'wit‘h 9.

pleasure-oriented palate. If you think flavor went out when
ﬁlters came in, try a Marlboro. This one brims with zest and
zip and the good, mild taste so dear to those who smoke for the

pure joy of it. Get yourself a pack of Marlboros and listen to i
your friends say, “There, by George, goes a. smoker who knows -

a hawk from a hanclsaw.”

But I digress. Anna Livia waited and waited for Stewart
Stalwart to ask her, but ‘two days before the Prom, to every-* _. ,
body’s amazemcnt,_he asked Rose-of-Sha~I'on Schwartz, a non- . 
descript girl with pavement-colored hair and a briefcase. . l

Anna Livia immediately phoned Werther Sigafoos. “My; _
Prom date has come down with a dread virus,” she said, “and_“ -' 

I have decided to accept your invitation, WaldrOp.’!l

 “Werther,” said Werther, “Oh, goody genders!”

The next day~~Anna Livia received a phone call from Stewart
Stalwart. “My Prom date has come down with a dread virus,-’3
he said. “Will you go with me?” ’

'.“Certainly,” she said and promptly phoned Werther and said, ' '1 
“I have come down with a dread virus and cannot go to the '_

So Anna Livia went to the Prom with Stewart and who do youf ii
think they ran into? Rose-of-Sharon with Werther, that’s who!

Oneness because they were both so dumpy. He fell wildly in ‘
lovewith her at the Prom,‘ and today they are married and -run _

Anna Livia and Stewart are happy, too. They are still juniors, I‘ i__

A-.lLear’ned Must
Share’ States
~Pearl S’. Buck

~ Right To.Learn

According to Miss Buck, the
"scholar consists of his attempt to
assure that everyone should have
the; right to learn up to his in-
dividual capacity.” V
I "V Once having experienced the
,_ joy of learning, every individual

" can be taught that learning is
helpful. The learned men, and
 this point was emphasized by
A "Miss Buck,"“must provide'sensi-
‘ble means to dispel ignorance.”
_'-‘He. must demand the use and
‘time of national media in an at-
tempt to make everyone experi-
: ence some of the “delight of
learning.’’ I

Deﬁnes Civilization

Miss Buck defined civilization

' transmitted through practical wis-
dom.” The privilege of reading.
For not to read is to be doomed
to permanent ignorance.”

“The aim of education is to
teach the love of learning, and
somehow we have failed in
achieving this aim,” she said.

_ “The learned man must share
- What he has learned with others,”
says Pearl Buck who spoke on
_.“fI‘he Delights of Learning” at the
 Honors Convocation on April 6.

The noted author and winner of
the Nobel Prize said that learning
distinguishes man from "the or-
ganis_ms. It becomes “a means of
solving unsolvable p rob lems.”
However, learning is not merely
an escape, “but an escape into
positive growth.” Only the ignor-
ant eanbe bored by lite,-for to
the learned, life is “pure adven-
ture.” ,

Miss Buck also stated that the
learned person must also be a
moral one, for learning demands
morality toward oneself and to-
ward others. The morality of a
learned person is contained in the
“attention that he pays to his “own

' physical and emotional health,”
C so that he may lead “a long, pro-
ductive life.”
