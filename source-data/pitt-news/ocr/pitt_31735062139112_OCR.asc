The Cap and Gown Club will pre-

“Cupid’s Capers” at the Nixon The-
ater this evening.‘ The play is in two
acts and is the best— produced by the
club, it being the product of the pen
of J. Woodman Thompson, a student
in the evening school. The chorus is
under the direction of F. D. Tyler,
’l2, .of the dental school. The major-
ity of the dances are originally worked
out by him. The ghost dance which
is a special feature will be presented
between the ﬁrst and second acts. An-
other feature will be a stunt by
“Polly” Calvin and “Zez” Luther. At
the recent out—of—t0wn performance

Charge of Chapel

President ‘Chowey Makes Speech on
“Hindoostan and Hindus.”

This morning in chapel was given
one of the most interesting programs
of the year. The morning service was
given’over entirely to the Cosmopoli-
tan Club. The principal speaker was
Paul Chowey, one of the studentsof
the college. Mr. Max Rochavein also
rendered a very pleasing selection on

I the violin, “Meditation,” from “Thais,’

showing a very great technique in this

‘line.

Mr. Chowey spoke on “Hindoostan
and Hindus.” He. gave a very inter-
esting sketch of the lifeand customs,
past and present. The social customs
and conditions of the natives served :1
rather lengthy discussion.

Speaking of women he said: “They
are editing magazines, papers and
periodicals in all languages, endeavor-
ing ‘to educate the classes in all the
manners and customs of civilized na-
tions. In this respect the women are
far in advance of the men for their
tremendous efforts along this line.

The masses of the Hindus are grad-

ually coming out of theldreamy past

into the race of the other nations.
Everywhere they are sending men out
to learn and brink back to India the
culture and science of the world. It
is the aim of t'he Hindu students to
bring about a "national awakening in
India.” I

Mr. Bowles’ Lecture

Discusses the Methods and Results of
Sanitation in Panama Canal Zone.

.Mr. J. T. B. Bowles delivered a let-
ture to the students, faculty and
friends of the University on Tuesday
evening, May 14, in Thaw Hall. The
subject of the address was “Methods.
and Results of Sanitation Along the
Isthmus of Panama.” .

In his lecture he reviewed the sani-
taryconditions along the isthmus to.
and including the French regime. Yel-
low and malaria fevers were the
scourge ' of the workmen, especially
t'he foreigner. .

/Many illustrations of the conditions
of the Canal Zone were shown. He
showed that the conditions have been
greatly modiﬁed since the ‘American
occupation. ’ Swamps have been
drained and ﬁlled. There has been a
campaign against the mosquito, the
carrier of malaria. Fresh water sup
plies, sewer systems and garbage dis-
posals have been instituted. So
marked have been the results of the
improvements on the zone that it will
have an effect on the world at large.

Mr. Bowles came to this country
to give his lectnefc at the Universities
of Harvard, Columbia, Pennsylvania
and Pittsburgh. He has been the
physiologist incharge of water sup-
plies and filtration plants on the canal

for the past two and’ one-halfyears. -

,CI1owey’s Interview
  With Abdul Baha

During the past week Mr. Paul
Chowey, ’l4, of India, president of the
Cosmopolitan Club, had an intervziew
with Abdul Baha, the great reformer
of Acca, who was quartered at the
Hotel Schenley during his brief stay
in this city.

According to ‘Mr’. Chowey, Azbdul
Baha is looking eagerly forward to
the time when prejudices of boun-
daries and distinctions between the
north, south, east and west will be
entirely removed and we will all be
as one. The time is 11ot far off when
such conditions will exist, Baha as-
serts. Baha has done much toward
bettering the conditions in his own
country and he now has about fifteen
million followers of his doctrines. 1

PROSPECTS.

A Many. writers‘/pii sociology say that
{heredity - and environment, form to
a great extent the character of the in-
dividual. They point out the fact that
if the individual has a good ‘heredity
and lives under conditions that af-
ford opportunity to develop the
chances of that individual to be a use-
ful citizen are increased greatly.’ _

T This theory m_ay well be applied to
a college newspaper. The college
paper that- has a past record that is all

. that can be desired an.d that works
0 ‘under favorable conditions is sure to
grow. in strength and eﬂiciency of

service. ,

The new staff of/the Weekly may
well ‘boast of its heredity and, surely,
'.a growing University, a growing Uni-
versity spirit, an increase in every-.
thing that tends to make for the bet-
terment of the caus.ef'of Pitt forms a

most favorable environment in which

to work.

Two years ago the Pitt Weekly was
founded, taking the place of the old
Courant. The men that have directed
the paper during the last two years
deserve the esteem and respect of
every student of Pitt forthe earnest
manner in which they conducted their
work; their never tiring efforts to

, build up the paper, and their patience

in trainingup men t-o take their places
when they past out of active service
on the paper. ‘Nothing was left" un-
done by them that would in any way
build up and strengthen the Weekly.
The present staff may well look to
them as examples ‘worthy to follow in
the condgct of the We-ekly during this
year. A H

For the first tirnein Athesliistory of
the Univers‘it?y*T.thé5rstaff-iof a Universi-

ty paper has been elected on a purely
competitive basis. The transition from
the old method to the new may cause
some little confusion at ﬁrst, but it is
the opinion of thebest men in the Um-
versity that the new system will be
very successful.

For itself, the new staff asks the
hearty co-operation of ever'y member
of the student body, of every member
of the faculty, of every member of the
Alumni Association, of every friend of
the University. With the help of all
those interested in anyway in the trials

i and.triumphs of Pitt, we hope to be
able to put out a paper that will be a _

credit to our Alma Mater.

 

COSMOPOLITAN CLUB

President Choweyand the members
of the Cosmopolitan club are setting

’ a pace in school activities that will be

hard to ‘equal by any other student
club. Since the very ﬁrst days of its
organization this club “has taken the
lead in all sorts of club work. To-
day the club“ had. charge of the weekly
convocation. This was a very pleas-
ing innovation in the chapel service,
and speaks well for those who are di-
recting the affairs of the club. Such
pro'gressiveness cannot but win the
admiration of every fair-minded stu-
dent. '

The motto _of -the club, “Above All
Nations Is Humanity,” is praise-
worthy and suggests very vividly the
basic principle on which the club was
founded. Every member of the club
is an earnest work, which, together
with the great spirit of mutual assist-
ance which prevails,’ has, most likely,
been the solid foundation on which
the success ofxthe club has been built
up.’ A

Let the various other clubs become .

a. little more progressive and give the
Cosmopolitans a race for the honor
of being" the most-progressive student
club. 0

Duquesne Theater next week will be
that always appealing romance of
Prosper Merimee’s “Carmen,” which,
like “Faust,” just recently given by
the Harry Davis stock players, has
fascinated playgoers and operagoers
more than any of the other world‘
stories of the past three centuries. It
is an arrangement of the theme in
which ‘Carn1en” is happily idealized
that the Davis players are to present
next week, ‘when Mary Hall will be
seen for the ﬁrst time‘ in this city in
the highly emotional role of the gipsy

cigaret girl of4Seville. This version“

will present the factory -ﬁght, the
smuggling episodes, the love quarrel
in the cabaret of‘Lillas Pastias, the
duel between Don Jose and Escamillo
in the mountains, the card !fortune-

telling scene and the fatal ﬁnish of_

Carmen’s career before the ‘bull ring.

Robert _,Gleckler will be the Don Jose-

and Dennis Harris the.Escamillo.

 

THE LYCEUM THEATER.

 

“The Barrier,” which will be next
week’s attraction at the Lyceum
Theater, is a human_drama of the

Alaska that so few know, not the,

mining, trapping or trading regions,
but the sunny, summery- farming
country, of which Rex Beach is the
only chronicler. The storyisbased

on the love between a white man and 4’
a supposedly Indian-tainted -girl, and

in it ﬁgure an army oﬁicer, a villain
and his accomplice of the human

type, a ﬁne comedy character, and

several others. to -make up the story
as Mr. Beach has s-o masterfully told
it in his novel. 0

,Half Mile 4- Matt Marshall
Breaks University Record,

While‘ Jim Marshall Equals
A Another.—‘Final Score 38-18.

The Pitt track team, eighteen

strong, journeyed to VVashington, Pa._,

last Saturday and triumphed over the
ancient rival of the Gold and Blue by
a score of 38 to 18. While the sc-o.~‘<:
looks rather lop-sided," several of the
events were very closely contested
and the Red and Black runners de-
serve much credit for their perform-
ance. The quarter and half-mile
events were exciting and in the lat-

.ter Matt Marshall was forced to break

for this distance was held by Floyd
Rose, who established a record of 2:04

ably been beaten several times, but the
time was not allowed as the Gold and
Blue runner did not ﬁnish ﬁrst.
Captain “Pork”'Bryson was the star
of the day and too much praise can-
not be accorded Pitt’s“ speedy leader.
The instructions in thefhalf-mile were

, for Matt Marshall to take the lead at

the start and make a fast pace all the
Captain Bryson was to stick
to the leading VV. &. J. runner and win
from him by :1 small margin in order
to save himself for the quarter. Sume-

, how the dope went wrong, as Brush
of W. &‘J. was leading when about
-150 yards from the ﬁnish, with Matt

about 8 yards behind ‘and Bryson
trailing along 5 yards after Matt. I
looked to the spectators as
Matt were about “all in” and would
not be able to pull past Brush, who
was running strong. Bryson evidently
thought the same as he rapidly closed
thehdistance ‘between himself and the
leader. He passed Matt and‘ Brush
and sprinted toward the ﬁnish now
less than 50 yards ahead, but his spirit
seeinfed to put new life into Marshall,
who also passed the Red and Black
runner. When Bryson saw Matt pull

FF

‘up he slowed his pace and saved him-
, self for the quarter, Matt Winning by

several yards in 2:01. Bane of Pitt
ﬁnished behind the W. & J. man and
his performance was very creditable

‘as his time was about 2:06. He is

expected_ to‘ make a strong bid next
year and with proper training will
prove a valuable man in the future.
‘Brush of W. & J. made a splendid
showing in both the half and quarter
exhibiting stamina and nerve._

The quarter was another thriller and
again -Bryson beat his rival,‘ Brush.

The former record.

This time has prob— -

tliough‘

Pitt entered Brys-on, Rosenthal and
Davis in this event, but only managed
to get the place annexed by Bryson.
Davis had run the 100 and Rosenthal
the 100 and 220, and either of these
men should‘ have‘ been able to win
from Brysoniwho was still tired from
the gruelling half. Brush led all the
way down the back stretch with
Davis, Bryson and Rosy following in
the order named. Bryson again saw
it wasup to ‘him to beat the W. & J.
mankand, tired as he was, took up the
burden. The rival runners fought all
the way to the ﬁnish and the Pitt cap-
tain managed to win the event by a
small margin. Davis ﬁnished ‘a bad
third while Rosenthal did not ﬁnish
at all.

Rosy broke at the start of the 100
and was put back a yard, but at that
was within an inch or so of Jim Mar-
shall at the ﬁnish... This race was a
close one and the time was 101-5.

The 220 was as close‘ a race between
Jim and Rosyas a race, ever gets to
be. The judge taking ﬁrst man
grabbed Rosy and the man judging
second also got him. It was ﬁnally
decided to give it to Marshall but had
the race been between a Pitt and VV.
& J. man it would undoubtedly have
been called

Capt. Crumrine took both hurdles
with Boots of Pitt second. The latter
is expected to" make a great showing
before he graduates as he_ has three

RAIN s1>01Ls THE
WAYNESBURG GAME

I By R. E. G.,' ’l4.

Rain in the fourth inning spoiled

an exciting game Saturday at
Waynesburg. The score stood two
and two. Pitt scored their runs in

the second inning. Over was pitch-
ing splendid ball for Pitt holding the
opposing team hitless and runless un-
til the rain commenced and the ball
became so slippery that good twirling
was -out of question.

The team appears to have their
batting eyes again, having made fpur
hits in as many innings. “Red”
Smith hit the ball, on the nose for
two bases. A

The addition of Rectenwald, former
star catcher for the Pittsburgh Col-
legians, has materially strengthened
the team.. ’ .

This week the team will line up

against Muskingum College on Thurs-_

a tie. The time was"

day, and W. dz J on Saturday. Both
games will probably be played at Ex-
position Park. The ’varsity. has now

starting on the home stretch. It
hopes to change its luck and turn the
tables on the teams which have beaten
them in the past. The rivalry with
VV. & J. is very tense and the fellows
all intend to keep up the good work
which-the tennis and
have started. ,

The chances for an improvement in
the team are brighter now than they
have been for sometime past. Man-
ager Hurst is trying to secure Expo
Park. to practice on while the Fili-
pinos are away. To all probabilities
the next four games will be played
there. Wi.th such an opportunity as
this Coach McCreery could soon
bring the team into.

A captain will be elected next Sat-
urday after the. VV. & J. game.

PITT WILL COMPETE IN
A   . BIG INTERCOLLEGIATE

The annuallmeet of the Pe.'ins_vi—
Vania Intercollegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation will be held at Harrisburg, Pa.
next Saturday and Pitt will send a.
strongvteam. ‘The cream of the col-
leges of this state with the exception
of Penn will be represented and the

lisle Indian School, Dickinson, Penn
State, Lafayette, Lehigh, Swarthmore,
Haverford, Muhlenberg, Bucknell
Washington & Jefferson, Pittsburgh
and others will be represented.

Jim Marshall and D'avis.will run in
the 100: Marshall, Davis and Rosen-
thal in the 220; Bryson and Rosen-
thal in t'he 440, and Matt Marshail
will run in the half. Galvin will toss
theweights for the Gold and Pilue
and Tinsley will compete in the pole
vault and high jump. It is possible
that McKinney or Boots will be taken
but much depends on their showing
‘before the meet. If the former goes
he will be entered in the high jump
and pole vault, while if the latter goes
he will run the 120-yard low and 22’)-
yard high hurdles and compete in the
broad jump. The team will be ac-
companied by Manager Hall, who is
president of the "Association, and
Trainer Hunter Johnson. Pitt back-
ers expect to score at least 22 points
but it is hard to make apredic‘-tion

MacKreIl Loses First Match
in Three Years—_—Game With
Cornell is Close

Pitt’s star tennis aggregation won

two easy matches from State andiW. .

& J. and then lost a hard contest to
Cornell 4-2. ‘
Thursday afternoon, the team met

Penn State at the P. A. A. courts and 4

won an easy victory by a score of
6-0. The result was not doubtful as
the players had won from State on
their grounds 5-1, and were in fine con-
dition for the second contest. _

MacKrell loafed during the ﬁrs-t set
but ﬁnally won 8-6_and took the sec-
ond 6-1. Wright had no trouble in
beating Hay and Capt. Wilbert beat
Harris‘ easily. E«be’s ﬁrst set with
Patterson went. 7-5, but he got the
second by a score of 6-3. This made
12 straight sets won by the Gold and
Blue players, as they won both
matches in doubles. -

vaded Pitt town, but were destined to
journey home badly‘ defeated. Pitt
again won straight sets making a total
of 24-0, when the State match was

Wilbert and Ebe, Pitt, defeated
Baggs and Hamilton, 6-0, 6-1.

On the next day, Pitt lost her sec-
ond match of the year to Cornell‘ on
the University Club Courts. The close-
ness of the contest is shown in the
summary which shows Cornell with 81
games won to Pitt’s 77. Manager
MacKrell.was a little off in his play-
ing and lacked the snap which gener-
ally characterizesi his play. This is
the ﬁrst intercollegiate match he has
lost during his three years of compe-
tition and the Gold and Blue adher-
ents hope it will be the last he loses.
He won the ﬁrst set 6-3, but seemed
tired after losing the second 8-6 and
lost the third 7-5. He will be matched
against 'Minnesota’s star who was run-
ner-up at the intercollegiate meet last
year in the next match which is next
Thursday afternoon. _

Wright, who played second for
Pitt, was unable to solve Major’s
serve and lost 6-3, 6-3. In the doubles
he was wise to. his opponent’s twist-
ers and out_pl.ayed him. Capt. Wil-
bert was downed by Cummins , of
Cornell in close sets 7-5, 6-3.

Ebe, Pitt’s, freshman player, was
the only one to win in the singles,
getting away with Buchanan, his op-
ponent, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3‘. He has only lost
one set this year. i

In the doubles MacKrell and
Wright won over Major and Buchan-
an after three bad sets, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
If Ebe and Wilbert had been able to
get away with their opponents, Pitt
would have tied up, but they lost
after‘ winning the second set 6-0.

It is to be hoped’ that the Cornell
players inwardly compared the treat-
ment accorded them by their Pitts-
burgh hosts to that ‘handed the Pitt
football team 'last‘ fall in Ithaca. Few
men who made the trip to the town
on Lake Cayuga last year will for-
get how the Ithacan hosts acted to-

DIRECTOR TALKS TO

SCHOOL OF EDUCATION’

Director Rynearson, a man promi-
nent in ‘educational circles, was the
speaker at the regular Monday Chapel
of the School of Education- -Mr.
Robertson expressed the consens_us of
opinion when he said that it was a
privilege and an honor to hear from
a .man so »_well versed in his subject
and’ so successful in his occupation.
He said in part: i »

“The members of the School of
Education are to be especially con-
gratulated" upon the training they are
receiving. We must have the ideal
of knowing something about -every-
thing, and everything. about
thing. But mere knowledge of the
subject does not make a good teacher,
and it wastes the time of both pupﬂs
and teacher while the ‘novice is learn-
ing through irreparable mistakes the
very things with which these grad-
uates will be equipped. The scarcely
-realized scope of the ‘high schools in
teaching, controlling and directing the
impressionistic adolescent-mind opens
up ‘great responsibilities for the
teacher. The‘ need for especially
trained teachers for secondary schools
is indeed great-—the School of Educa-
tion is one answer to the problem.”

‘\A‘HIT AT EAST LIVERPOOL

The Cap and Gown Club journeyed
to East Liverpool, Ohio, last Wednes-
day and presented their play entitled
“Cupid"s Capers” in the Ceramic The-
ater of that place. The troupe, con-
sisting of ﬁfty members, including the
augmented student orchestra, reached
the town in a special car about eleven
o’clock. Several rousing Pitt yells
were given at the station and from
that time the Pitt spirit seemed to
rule everywhere. p

The play was given to a crowded
house for the beneﬁt of the East
Liverpool 0. & P. League baseball
team. The play made quite a ‘hit with
the audience as they applauded time
and again. The cast performed‘ ex-
ceptionally well, butthe special fea-
ture was-the dances by the chorus
The
treatment received was ﬁne and the
fellows are loud in their praise of the
trip.

Robert Underwood Johnson, the

at t'he University of New York’s com-
mencement that New York as a liter-
ary cen_ter was‘*ridiculous——that no-
where in this country was poetry more
appreciated than in Boston, and no-
where less than in New York.

“In fact,” said Mr. Johnson after-

about equal to the Earlham.College
