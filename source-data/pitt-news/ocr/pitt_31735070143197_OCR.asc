Organizers vent about G—20 at conference

Caitlyn Christensen
Staﬁ’ Writer

A giassroots coalition concerned with world
economic issues hosted the 2009 Freedom
Conference at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial

_ Hall yesterday evening.

“We are coming here out of fear of big
government,”,said organizer Michael Mc-
Mullen. “We are a broad-based coalition of
conservative groups seeking alternatives to
the G—2o.”

McMullen said close to 450 tickets were

sold for the event, but there were fewer than
100 people in attendance. '
Keynote speaker G. Edward Griffin com-

- pared the United States government to a

genie granting the wishes of the American
people. .

“We should be careful what we wish for,”
Grifﬁn said. “Americans are making the wish
to the government genie for unlimited quan-
tities of money to protect them from hard-
ships. Instead, they are getting unlimited
quantities of money that limit their personal
freedoms.” '

, Grifﬁn wrote a book about the founda-

tion and corruption of the Federal Reserve
System. In his talk, he cited the Federal Re-
serve as the source of the economic crisis, an

accusation which feature speaker Thomas '
p E. Woods supported. <

Woods, a senior fellow at the Ludwig von
Mises Institute, called for auditing a Federal
Reserve System that can “make money out
of thin air.” .

“The failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac are small potatoes compared to the Re-
serve,” Woods said, citing central banks as
the cause of economic instability. ‘

Woods said the G-20 is the ﬁnal stepping

stone in the process to replace the dollar
with a new global currency.

“People aren’t falling for it anymore,”
Woods said. “The governmentwants to limit
our currency. When you have a world curren-
cy, you’re stuck. You can’t ﬂee anywhere.

“A giant prison is the model for all of

' this,” said Woods.

Woods apologized to ‘Pittsburgh for hav-
ing to host the G-20 Summit. _

“I’m sorry you have to behere for the
G—20,” Woods said. “What a scam.”

Featured speakerjoan Veon, an indepen-

dent international reporter, said the United

Nations is seeking to erase the barriers be-

tween ‘countries to “create a new world or— ’

der.” Veon said the G-20 is ﬁnalizing country
interdependence. , I “

“They who control the central banks of
the world control the entire world and its
people,” Veongsaid. “He who has the gold
makes the rules.” - '

She said that a global economic con-
spiracy stretched back to the 197os,,with
Nixon taking the United States off the gold
standard. The G-20’s proposal of a “new
global currency” is another step in limit-
ing national sovereignty, leaving countries
with no barriers and “nothing protecting
its citizens.”' - . ‘

- “My only advice is to ‘plan for the unex-

‘ pected at home, work and church,” Veon

said. “Cry out to God to help us.”
She concluded her talkby» quoting bibli-

V cal, Psalm '37:4-5,-“Delight yourself in the
_Lord and commit your way to him.”

Katie Shenot said. Most of the extras found
at this casting call will work on a scene shot
at the Mellon Arena. A

Participants will earn $60 for eight
hours of work plus overtime compensation
of $11.25 per hour, but they should expect
to dedicate 12 hours on a work day.

People should be prepared to give their
contact information and measurements
and have a photo taken at the casting
call.

Shenot said that people should style
their makeup normally but dress in busi-
ness casual attire..The movie takes place
in 1997, so Shenot recommends girls

‘ wear ’9os hairstyles with a lot of body

— like Jennifer Aniston from the sitcom
“Friends.”

People who don’t receive a call back
within the next week might still be called
for another scene. “Love and Other Drugs”
will use 3,000 extras. A

Everyone who attends the casting call
will be entered into the casting agency’s

upcoming Russell Crowe movie, “The Next

The script for “Love and Other Drugs”
was based on the Jamie Reidy nonfiction
book, “Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra

Opinions  

New painkillers

prevent

ur society is pill—happy.
0 Whether it’s a fever, a

headache or allergies,
pills provide a simple fix for a
variety of ailments. And when
we’re in pain, pills are there to
assuage any discomfort.

Used properly, prescription
painkillers, or opioids, alleviate
pain symptoms after surgical op-
erations or as a result of other
more serious medical conditions.
But some people use them for
other purposes — namely, get-
ting high.

According to a study by the
Partnership for a Drug Free
America, one in ﬁve teens has
abused prescription pain medica-
tions, such as 0xyContin.

To hasten the high, opioids are
frequently crushed up and snort-
ed, or even mixed with water and
injected intravenously, accord-
ing to The New York Times. But
now, pharmaceutical companies
are ﬁghting back. They’ve taken
a direct approach to combating
misuse, an approach that, even
if only a partial solution, should
still curtail misuse.

Companies are developing a
new type of opioid that resists
tampering. While some pills are

rubber-like and more difficult‘

to crush, others trigger adverse
reactions when altered and then
inhaled.

. Certain pills have an in-
ner corethat, when externally
crushed and blended with the
medicinal outer layer, neutralizes
the potential high. Other pills
produce unpleasant reactions
such as flushing or itching when
they’re meddled with.

Some might argue that sub-

stance abuse is best treated.

through education and counsel-
ing. Those who understand the
consequences of abuse should

a quick fix to
 abuse 

be less inclined to engage. Sure,
those are important preventa-
tive measures and they shouldn’t
be lessened in the wake of more
resilient drugs — but tamper-
resistantpills are an innovative
and very direct approach to re-
ducing abuse. They’re a quick fix
that’s not a solution to the overall
problem, but a preventative mea-
sure that should ultimately curb
the number of abusers.

Not every teen or college kid
spends their Friday nights abus-
ing prescription pills —— there
are far more out binge drinking.
This doesn’t mean, though, that
non—users are detached from the
prescription painkiller problem.
A 2008 federal survey found that
an estimated 4.7 million Ameri-
cans has used prescription pain
relievers in the previous month
for reasons other than pain relief.

Opioid abuse costs at least $11 '

billion per year in excess medi-
cal care.

America stands in the wake
of a health care conundrum, and
it’s clear that prescription pill
abuse contributes to health care
expenditures. This further merits
a quick solution.

Unless these tamper—resistant
pills become ubiquitous in the
pharmaceutical world — assum-
ing they can be cheaply produced
— perhaps they won’t deter the
problem to the maximum degree.
Also, these new pills can’t protect
against overdoses or the lesser
abuser who chooses to swallow
a few pills incrementally.

Yet when it comes to sub-
stance abuse, the causes are too
diverse to allow an all—encom-
passing solution;

It seems the small measures,
such as these new pills, are the
best way to combat misuse of this
nature.

Protesters deface capitalism

Protesters ignore Pittsburgh ’s rich history of capitalism and industry

 
   

Giles Howard
Columnist

Despite their respective goals, G—20
protesters have descended upon Pitts-
burgh with just one uniﬁed message:
a cry against capitalism, portraying
it as an oppressive and unjust system
foisted upon billions of people by a
cabal of world leaders.

These protesters promise to make
our city their ideological playground
ﬁlled with tent cities, anti—capitalist
marches and —— ifthe bluster of online
anarchists is to be believed — threats
ofviolence directed againstlocal busi-
nesses.

” But Pittsburgh is a vibrant coun-
terpoint to the whining of socialists,
Marxists and anarchists who seek to
blame an economic system for all the
world’s troubles. Our libraries, muse-
urns and universities are the product
of industry.

Every building, public space or
charitable foundation with the name
Mellon, Frick, Carnegie, Heinz or
Schenley is a product of capitalism
and the wealth generated by innova-

tion and competition.

Of course, our city’s relationship
with capitalism and industryhasbeen
tumultuous. From the great railroad
strike of 1877 to the Battle of Home-
stead to the attempted assassination
of Henry Clay Frick, Pittsburgh has
bomewitnesstoviolence perpetrated

notexisttoday as acenter of educaﬁon
and medical research, had it not been
for our past industrial success.

Our story of success is one of hard
work, competition and innovation. Itis
astory that goes along with the history
of capitalism in this nation. The simple
truth is that no other economic system

by both labor and capital.

But in spite of the occasional
conﬂict between labor and business,
Pittsburgh’s economic history is one
of growth driven by industry.

Weoitenlookback onthe practices
of 19th century industrywith distaste.
Today we view coal, the material that
powered this nation, as a disastrous
pollutant. However, Pittsburgh would

would have enabled such a history. We
need look no further than the gulags
of Soviet Russia, the murderous Great
Leap Forward of Communist China or
the authoritarian nightmare of Fidel
Castro’s Cuba to understand the capi-
talist imperative.

The history of state-directed
economies is the greatest vindica-

Home cooking a tasty, healthy alternative  

Students, don’t fear the stove. Home cooking a simple solution to staying healthy, reducing health care woes

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

One of the things I was most look—. , ,.

ing forward to this semester was
moving off campus. After a year of
signing in guests and eating semi-
palatable food at Market Central,
there was little more that excited
me than being able to live on my
own terms (except no pets).

As a new apartment dweller,

however, I quickly realizedl lacked
a fundamental skill of indepen-
dent living: the culinary arts. Upon
moving in, I’d taken about a week’s
worth of my mom’s cooking with
me. Well, that’s long gone.
 So commenced my diet of cere-
al for breakfast, Milano’s Pizza for
lunch and cereal for dinner. From
time to time, my friends would take
pity on me, offering to make me
dinner or bring me home some of
their leftovers.

Tired of the gastronomic inad-
equacy of my lifestyle, I decided
to take on my stove. With slight
trepidation, I made the trip out
to Market District (I’m not hipster

enough for Whole Foods) and,
upon my return, began myforay
into cooking.

, . I tried something simpllerhop?
ing to avoid abjectfailure. And
even though my pasta cameout
undercooked and my sauce a bit
tasteless, a certain satisfaction
followed in knowing that I had
prepared the meal. The comfort
of knowing what goes into my food
and how it was prepared is a feeling
you can’t get from a box.

Nearly everything in our su-
permarkets that is already pre-
pared or in the frozen foods aisle
is pumped withunnatural sweet-
eners and preservatives.'Even the
non—organic fruits andivegetabhles
in the produce aisle are closer’ to
being real food than their juiced
and canned counterparts.’ "I

With so much debate over
health care reform, encouraging
Americans to reevaluate their diet
is one of the simpler solutions. In-
stead of trying to ﬁnance elaborate
and oft-ineffective procedures for
our senior citizens, we should. be
looking to prevent conditions, like

diabetes, obesity and heart disease
in persons of all ages by changing
how and what we eat.

Rethinking our meals need not
involve highly regimented diet
plans. Making an active effort to
avoid fast food or synthetic food-
like substances — anything made
with more than 10 ingredients you

« can’t pronounce -— is a crucial ﬁrst

step.

In a recent New York Times col-
umn, Michael Pollan underscored
this point. He claimed that the
$2.3 trillion that the United States
spends on health care would be
much more useful if it were applied
to proactively preventing our af-
ﬂictions rather than treating them
for generations to come.

But it won’t be an easy task.
According to Pollan, “reforming
the food system is politically even
more difﬁcult than reforming the
health care system.” And so long
as the problems associated with
unhealthy eating can be relegated
to the future, they will not be taken
seriously. a ’ ,

Itis asad truth that our health

care industry proﬁts more by
treating diseases than preventing
them. Treating chronic diseases

‘ like diabetes ensures thathealth

care companies can proﬁt foryears
off of a patient. Teaching that same
patient to eat healthily and exer-
cise proves much less lucrative. ‘
Some will claim that taxing and

publicly lambasting unhealthy

food and drink makers is the an-
swer. While New York failedito
pass a tax on sugary drinks, state
public health officials developed
an ad campaign that links sodas
and stoutness. But until individu-
als start buying into the notion of
preparingfood-with natural in-
gredients, processed snacks and
sugary beverages will continue

to-seemicheaper and more con-

venient. E

So where does the average
college student factor in to this?
No one can promise that making
dinner will solve the woes of our
health care industry — but it will
go a long, way toward bringing
you closer to your foodand un-
derstanding what you’re putting

into your body.
Yes, certaincrops and animals

are still raised with the help of pes- "

ticides and antibiotics. But at some
point, it’s not so much about eating
organic produce or well-groomed
animals. It’s about discovering that
cooking for yourself can be excit-
ing, satisfying and much healthier
than eating out.

It is understood that cooking -—

is an undertaking that the average
college student cannot afford to
do every night. With exams and
papers creeping up every week, it’s
hard to devote time to the kitchen

o instead of the library.

But ﬁnding time in our sched-
ules to make our own food can be
a small step toward improving our
health and saving some money.

It seems my newfound cooking
skills are catching on. My room-

mate, Neil,-is also beginning to .

recognize the beneﬁts of home-
cooked meals. Too bad he loves
making me do the dishes.

Of course, with this chance for
success comes the chance for failure,

and no capitalist economy is without '

those who have failed. This appears
tobea major source of contention for
protest organizations likeBailOutthe

G-20 protests with a March ForJobs
on Sunday.

On its website, Bail Outthe People
called for “a moratorium on layoffs,
foreclosures and evictions” and pro-
claimed “the rightof everyonetoajob

isridiculous.  ' ' .

Bail Out the People is demanding
that need be elevated above ability

to perform a job or the job’s necessity

The touring production of “Cirque du Soleil: Alegria” will hit audiences with a series of high-concept acrobatic acts

Kieran Layton

_ A &E Editor

The presence of conﬂict between
tradition and youth can be seen in
countless ways: a phone call vs. tex-
ting, PCs vs. Macs or even Facebook
vs. Twitter.

But watching trapeze artists,
contortionists and gymnasts play

out such a relevant battle? It’s not .

the ﬁrst (or second or third) con-
cept that comes to mind.

That’s precisely what audiences
can expect to see, however, when
“Cirque du Soleil: Alegria” comes
to Pittsburgh at the Petersen Events
Center from Oct. 7-11.

Instead of focusing solely on
conﬂict, “Alegria” will convey a feel-
ing of jubilation and celebration.
This is no surprise, considering the
title is a Spanish word that means

,“joy,” according to Sheryl-Lynne
-Valensky, the ‘assistant artistic di-

rector of the show’s touring pro-
duction. , '

“It’s one of what we call the ‘feel-
good’ shows that Cirque du Soleil
does. Basically, we have a lot of
great acts with a lot of high—energy
music that celebrates life and the
differences between people,” Va-
lensky said.

. These differences —— namely,

- between the old and the young -—
» are played out by characters like the
Old Birds and the Angels. Valensky 7

said that the Old Birds represent
an older generation stuck in their

tradition, while the Angels “are all ‘

about change and innovation.”
While there’s not necessarily
a plot, the carnivalesque acts for

' which Cirque is famous revolve

around a central theme and are
uniﬁed by the music.
“With Cirque, we have themes,

g and we tellstories,» but it’s not like

musical theater where you have
a deﬁnite beginning, middle and

n , end. We have a lot of threads that go

through the show,” she said.

One such thread includes a
striking image of two singers: one
dressed in white, one in black. The.

‘White Singer “represents good-

ness,” while the Black Singer “is
sort of her alter ego.”

“There’s [sic] all sorts of things
on different levels. You can watch
[“Alegria”] when you’re ﬁve years
old and be amazed, and you can

watch it when you’re 50 and still
be amazed, but you also might get
things on a different level,” she
said. ‘

Valensky compared the expe-
rience to many recent animated
Disney ﬁlms, which contain bla-
tant content to entertain children.
The ﬁlms also include a subtle and
subversive ‘humor aimed towards
adults.

“Alegria” was ﬁrst performed
in,1994, and it ran for 15 years. Va-
lensky said that for this tour, the

artistic team updated and refreshed‘

the show and also adapted it for an
arena setting, like the Pete.

“In 1994, what was current was

I

the Internet and how it started to
explode — just a different way of
doing things, which fed into the
theme of ‘Alegria.’ The old ways
and tradition vs. the newness and
change in the world was so relevant
because at that time, there was the
computer revolution,” she said.

For any Cirque du Soleil show,
Valensky said the creators try to
“take something that’s relevant at
the time and see what comes out
of the rehearsal process with the
acrobats and the artists.”

The 55 performers for “Alegria”
represent more than 187 countries,
and includes Olympians, athletes,
singers and dancers. To keep up

with the stressﬁil regimen that a
Cirque du Soleil show entails, Va-
lensky said that they require an
obvious amount of discipline.

“When [performers] come to us
to be in the show, they already have
a training routine, so we just pro-
vide them with the tools to continue
that. It’s more about prevention
[of injury] than it is rejuvenation.
We give them awhole backstage of
training equipment to keep them in
shape,” she said.

Despite the immense burden of
traveling,the company adapts well,
and the production team travels
with it’s own stage, lighting and
sound equipment. I

V All Courtesy Cainarind
Audiences can expect to see trapeze artists (top left), contortionists (right) and ﬁre dancers (bottom left). Yes, your mind will be blown.

For those who have never seen
a Cirque du Soleil show, Valensky
said’ there is no better choice than
“Alegria” to break in a newbie.

“With everything going on in the
world right now, with video games
and the like, the fact that you can
amaze someone and shock them
—— when someone sits there and
goes ‘Wow!’ without any electron-
ics or special effects —— that to me
is spectacular,” she said.

For Pitt students, the show

makes it easy and affordable to '

garner such a reaction. Students
are able to purchase $25 tickets now
through Friday for Level Three seats
on the Ticketmaster website.

In case you didn’t know, the G—20
is happening in Pittsburgh. '

Tomorrow, the leaders of the
world will descend upon our
quaint city and walk among us
mere Steel Town mortals. Well,
maybe not so much walk as get
chauffeured around in bullet-
proof limos. ‘

I’m not going to delve into
anything political here because,
quite frankly, I don’t know enough
about the government to speak
about it in a public forum.

What I do know, however, is
fashion. Tomorrow marks the ar-
rival of one of the best-dressed
women in politics —— Michelle
Obama. As entertaining as pro-
testers are, what I really want

a glimpse at is what Michelle
decides to wear to her dinner

row. ,

Much credit is-due to awoman

Pitti j ust does it and makes unmm

switchito um.

After a roughly 11-year rim using Adidas for all athletic uniforms and warm—up gear, Pitt signs the Oregon-based company

Diana Connorl SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

After switching from Adidas to Nike, Ryan Brode and all other Pitt

‘ student-athletes will now have Nike’s signature Swoosh on their .

jerseys and warm—up gear.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

When athletic director Steve Ped-
erson came to Pitt in 1996, only the
football and basketball programs
were provided team apparel.
Smaller, less heralded sports
teams at the University had to buy
their own shoes and do their own
laundry. In 1997, though, Pitt signed
adealvvithAdidas. With the exception
of a couple of years in the early 2000s
when the football programwore Nike
gear, the relationship between Adidas
and Pitt lasted 11 years. .
In August, however, Pitt an-
nounced a new deal with sporting
juggernaut Nike, which now outﬁts all
sports programs at the school.

. “When it came right down to it, it’s
what our student-athletes are most
comfortable in and feel strongest
about,” Pederson said. “Our student-
athletes knew our contractwas com-
ing to an end and hardly a day went
by when someone didn’t say ‘I hope
we switch to N ike.”’ .

Pitt will not divulge the terms of
the agreement, butPederson said that
it is “a fairly long_—term” deal. Earlier

this year, North Carolina signed a '
I10-year, $37.7 million deal with the

brand. In 2008, Memphis signed a
ﬁve-year, $11.3 million deal.

The change. means new uniforms
and apparel forall student—athletes. It
also means acclimatingto new equip-
ment after growing accustomed to
Adidas. For most, it" has been a wel-
comed change.

“The Nike apparel in general is a
lot nicer,” Liz Carroll, a junior mid-
ﬁelder and forward for the women’s
soccer team, said. “The Adidas stuff
was just boring, the same stuff every
year.”

She did say, however, that she pre-
ferred Adidas cleats to N ike‘ — not
surprising, considering that Adidas
is widely regarded as an international
soccer brand.

Marie Eanes-Fennelly, a senior
tennis player, agreed that the Nike
gear is an upgrade.

“I think the whole team in gen-
eral is excited about a new change,”
Eanes-Fennelly said. “We’ve had the
same stuff all the time for years. Any
kind of change is welcome and ap-
preciated.”

In contrast to Carroll, Eanes—
Fennelly said she preferred the Nike
footwear from a tennis standpoint,
citing a lighter, more ﬂexible shoe to
the heavier Adidas model the team

had in the past.

But smaller sports such as soccer‘!
and tennis aside, deals of this nature
with prominent athletic companies
are fueled by the more visible, na-
tional scale sports: football and bas-
ketball.

“Football and basketball drive
Nike’s interest in their association
with us,” Pederson said. “Certainly
they want to outﬁt all of our student
athletes, but for the most part, the
way you’re able to make this happen is .
through the interest they have invery
national kinds of programs.”

In recent years, Pitt has become
a nationally high—proﬁle school in
the larger sports, especially basket-
ball. The men’s team made it’s ﬁrst
Elite Eight appearance last year, and
the women’s team went from never
making an NCAA Tournament ap-
pearance before 2007 to reaching
the Sweet 16 the past two seasons.
Pitt was also one of just four schools
last year to have a football team go to
abowl game, a men’s basketball team

make the Elite Eight and a women‘§“=‘

basketball team make the Sweet 16.
The others were Connecticut‘, Michi-
gan State and Oklahoma.

Pitt’s football team has been in the “others receiving votes” category all year and hasn’t moved up, despite a perfect record. '3)

Kyle Craig
‘ Staﬁ” Writer

“Others receiving votes” is often
a dubious distinction to have as a
college football team. It denotes
that the team is almost relevant,
marginally important and one step
out of the national spotlight. ‘
Right now, the Pitt Panthers
lurk in the shadows of both the
Associated Press and USA Today
national rankings. They were
there in the beginning of the sea-
son and remain there, despite an
undefeated record. '

The AP Poll ranks 10 one-loss

teams within the Top 25, while
the USA Today Poll includes nine
teams who have suffered a defeat.
Meanwhile, Cincinnati remains
the only Big East team included
in either poll.

Some fans might scratch their
head to see Florida State (2-1),
who struggled againstjacksonville
State, or Nebraska (2-1), a team
with zero “signiﬁcant” victories,
listed in front of the Panthers.

Yet, the lack of recognition
might be a blessing for a Pitt team
that has previously wilted after
receiving early-season accolades.
Last year’s squad responded to
inclusion in preseason _polls by

promptly self-destructing against
Bowling Green. A

expectations and self—indulging'
that accompanies them. Being

66

The polls at this point mean nothing,

Dave Wannstedt

If anything, Pitt should be gun-

shy of the polls and the type of A

under the radar can be rather
advantageous — it keeps players

hungry and places a chip on their '
shoulders.
It appears that the Panthers

will need to ﬁght for every bit ofa I

national attention they receive

‘ this season —— especially con-

sidering the recent belittling of
the Big East by talking heads and
columnists.

At the same time, Pitt’s place-
ment outside of the Top 25 ade-‘ "
quately describes a team that still
has several questions to answer.
Most of the questions are a result
of the three teams the Panthers
have beaten.

A victory against Youngstown?‘
State was a foregone conclusion.

Vick is a disgusting person

f and deserves to be protested

  

MCT Campus

Michael Vick will officially make his return to the NFL this Sunday when his Eagles play the
Chiefs, and many expect a season of protests for Vick, both in and out of Philadelphia

Adam Littman
Asst. Sports Editor

L Michael Vick is going to feed dogs.

An animal rescue group in Washington,
D.C., plans to donate ﬁve bags of dog food to
a shelter every time Vick is tackled when his

Eagles play the Redskins Oct. 26. Perhaps not '

directly, but Vick gets tackled and dogs get food
because of it, ergo Vick is feeding the dogs.

It’s a great plan, especially considering the
donations will be made only ifVick is tackled.
Vick is an abomination of a human, so any
good done from his getting hit by some of the
world’s ﬁnest athletes is fantastic. Plus, he’s
bound to be a bit rusty since it has been some
time since he last played. . '

Vick hasn’t played in a regular season NFL
game since Dec. 31, 2006, when he and the
Falcons lost to, coincidentally, the Eagles 24-
17. Since then, Vick has spent 19 months in
prison on charges of operating and running
a dog ﬁghting ring.

On Sunday when the Eagles play the Kansas
City Chiefs in Philadelphia, Vick will see his
ﬁrst playing time in more than two years. Fans

, of dogs and those who value animal lives more

than human ones are not pleased Vick is ‘com-
ing back to the NFL. Protestors are expected to
attend most, if not all, Eagles games this year to
show their anger at Vick’s reinstatement.
Personally, I’m thrilled the group in Wash-
ington plans to donate dog food when Vick
gets tackled. Vick is a despicable human be-
ing, and if we can add even more insult to his
misfortune, I’m all for it. ~
But back before Vick turned into the scum
of the Earth he was one of the most elusive
players in all of football. Yes, it’s been a bit
I since he last played, but if he gets back into the

. speed of an NFL game and close to being the

same player he was, he might not get tackled
too frequently. We need to ensure we can still
protest him every week, so here are some other

ways to show Vick that he’s the most loathsome -

player in the  (sorry, Leonard Little):

Every time Vick steps on the ﬁeld, the per-
son operating the large screen in the stadium
should play clips from “Lassie” and dub over it
to say, “What’s that girl? Michael Vick is stuck
in a well? Good, he deserves it. Leave him.”

If Vick gets hurt, stand and applaud while
simultaneously squealing like a dog so he
knows the pain he inflicted on those dogs. a

If you see someone in a Vick jersey —— which
shouldn’t be hard, given that his is the second-
most popular jersey in the NFL store behind
Brett Favre’s — knock him out and take him
home. While he’s still knocked out, put him
in an electric collar and set it up so he gets
shocked if he tries to leave your basement,
attic, dungeon, etc. ’

When Vick throws an incomplete pass, give
your dog a Scooby Snack.

When Vick completes a pass, shave your
dog’s hair off. Sure, that seems like it affects the
dog more than Vick, but that’s not true. Once
Vick sees all those creepy bald dogs, he’ll think
twice about completing another pass.

IfVick runs for a touchdown, light a stuffed
animal dog on ﬁre.

If Vick somehow throws for a touchdown,
light an actual dog on ﬁre. Don’t worry about
harming the dog, though. Vick’s touchdown
led you to light the dog on ﬁre, ergo, Vick did
it. That won’t count against you — but against
Vick — when it’s time to see if he goes to big
kennel in the sky or groomer deep in the bow-

P els of hell.

Should the Eagles make the Super Bowl, but
lose, go to the local shelter and adopt a dog.
Then feed it, love it and accept it as a part of
your life until the dog, or you, die.

But if the Eagles win the Super Bowl, adopt

Lack of ranking could inspire
team as schedule gets harder ,-

Panthers < 13

Backed by stellar plaly from freshman running back Dion Lewis, the Panthers areofftgoa . - »

’ Ben Flllo I SENIOR STAFF PI.-IOTOGRAPHE

3-0 start for the ﬁrst time since 2000, yet they still aren’t ranked.

Beating Buffalo on the road was a-necessity
for any team at the top of a BCS confer-
ence. Controlling Navy was reassuring, yet
predictable considering the gap in athletic
talent when playing a service academy.
Now, North Carolina State appears on
the horizon, and the stakes are raised once

more. Each week, Pitt’s schedule contains‘

an incremental increase in difficulty, a
stairway of challenging games, culminat-
ing in a showdown against Cincinnati to
end the regular season.

The goal then is to advance one step
at a time and improve as the season pro-
gresses.

Sure, notoriety would be nice for those"

Pitt fans who disgustedly glance at No. 5
Penn State’s ranking after playing host to
juggernauts like Temple and Akron. But
the Panthers will need to earn the atten-
tion gradually.

Certain things still need to be sorted
out before Pitt’s status as a contender is
fully realized.

The defensive secondary needs to show
that it can stop an intermediate passing
attack that focuses on throwing the ball

before’Pitt’s front four can generate any

' pressure. The offensive line, which has

played admirably, needs to continue to
improve as the level of competition vastly
increases. \ ‘ .

In away, the polls are doing Pitt a favor
by withholding approval until it is undeni-
ably deserved. , ' .

A One man who certainly isn’t upset with
the rankings is Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt,
who said the polls aren’t albig topiqaround
the locker room. _ P ‘

“We’re comfortable just doing what
we’re doing. We’re just trying to win one
more game and keep moving. The polls
at thispoint mean nothing,” Wannstedt
said. '

' Wannstedt is right, and it’s an important
thing to keep in mind when looking at the
Top 25. Unquestionably, the rankings don’t
even begin to matter until the season is
drawing to a close.

More importantly, Pitt’s performance on »

the ﬁeld this Saturday will matter inﬁnitely
more than their performance in the polls
on Monday.

Now, these measures might seem a bit
extreme. But you need to sit down and look
yourselfin the mirror and ask, “Is protesting
Michael Vick really worth making some dogs
homeless or lighting a few dogs on ﬁre?”
Yes. It makes me so angry to think this man
is getting a second chance. Since the NFL caved
‘and allowed him back in the league after he
served his court—mandated jail time and lost
millions in savings and endorsements, as well
as any chance at respect from a majority of the
population, it’s up to us to show him he’s not

Nike not just appealing to current Pitt athletes

Athletic director Steve Pederson says that recruits in all sports like that Pitt is a Nike school _

Nike 4 13

team, is happy with the brand switch.

“I feel like Nike’s more of a basketball gear
[company] than Adidas. I like their shoes bet-
ter,” Frye said. “We haven’t gotten much gear
yet, but I deﬁnitely like Nike better.”

The team has yet to see what it will wear in
games this season. Several other Big East teams
outﬁtted by Nike -— Syracuse, Georgetown and

‘ Connecticut —— alldon auniform that includes
an almost skin—tight jersey for the upper body.

Frye does not know if that is the design Pittwill

wear, but he would be interested in that style.
“I thinkthe tighter would be good,”‘he said.
“You wouldn’t get caught on anything.”
And the change doesn’t stop at current ath-
letes. From a recruiting standpoint, playing

with Nike has provided a positive reaction from

prospective athletes whom several programs are
currently courting to play at Pitt in the future.
“Our coaches have already told me that the

ff;

feedback from people we’re recruiting is they
like the fact that were with Nike,” Pederson’
said. “A lot of the young people like that we’re
with Nike.” ‘

It is difﬁcult to gauge if the change to Nilileﬂ
will yield improved results in competition, but .

the morale of student—athletes cannot be an
overlooked aspect of the transition.

“If they feel good in it, then chances are
they’ll perform better in it,” Pederson said.
