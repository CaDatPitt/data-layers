Vilhjalmur Stefansson To Speak
To Assembly On “N orthward
Course Of Empire”

Classes To Be Omitted

Vilhjalmur Stefansson, explorer and
scientist, will come to the campus,§
‘Wednesday, December 12, to address a,l

general assembly of students and fac-E

ulty members, according to word re-,!

ceived from the Chancellor’s. ol”fice,l

Saturday. All classes will be omitted,
to provide time for the lecture.

Stefansson has selected for his sub-
ject “The northward course of em-
pire” in which he will consider his-
torically how we came to be obsessed
with the strange ideas about the Far
North which are only now gradually
dying out. He will show the uninter-
rupted spread of civilization northward
from its cradle in the tropics and why
that northward trend will not stop un
til the Arctic is opened up and devel-
oped. Stefansson plans to show the
lines along which that development
may proceed, dwelling particularly on
future transpolar commerce by air.

Stefansson.'s explorations into the
Far North have convinced him of the
possibilities of a future empire in the
Arctic. He has concentrated his ener-
gy in revealing the Arctic, and show-
ing the bearing of its potentialities on
the future of the race.

Born in Manitoba of Icelandic par-.
ents who pioneered both in Canad.‘i.§
and the Dakotas, Stefansson attended;
the University of North’ Dakota and‘
graduated from the University of Iowa, ,
A year in the Harvard Divinity school,
and two years as a. fellow in anthro-,
pology at the Harvard Graduate school’
ended his academic career.

The late President Theodore Roose-
velt said of him._ “There are only a
few men in this world that I envy. and
you are one of them.” Dr. Isaiah Bow-
man, director of American Geograph-
ical society said of Stefansson, “Stef-
ansson will stand. for all time as the
grea.t interpreter of the North.”

Many geographical societies have
bestowed gold medals upon Stefansson
for his explorations. Among these are
the American Geographical society,
Chicago Geographic society, Explorers
club of New York, Geographical socie-
ty of Philadelphia, National Geograph-
ic society, Paris Geographical society,
and the Royal Geographical society of
London. In 1921 he received a vote
of thanks from the Canadian govern-
ment moved by the prime minister.
Besides his bachelor ot arts degree
from Iowa, and his master's from
Harvard, he holds honorary doctor of
laws degrees from Michigan and Iowa,
and an honorary fellowship in the
American Museum of Natural history,
and the New York Academy of Sci-
ences.

Students Flunk
Beard Tesl:

Dr. E. J. Casselman of Mellon
Institute, does not think highly of
University students.

“A 45-year-old immigrant labor-
er would be far more useful as my
assistant,” he declared vehement-
ly.

This antipathy is said to be par-
tially justifiable, Dr. -Casselman
is at present occupied in testing
razor blades and has observed
that “most students can’t raise a
beard stiff enough to give a blade
a fair test."

VVhen the problem of testing
blades confronted him, he was
forced in his extremity to apply to
other fellows,ol' the Institute for
assistance. He now has 13 on his
list, all of whom are shaving faith-
fully every day. “And to think
that it was all I could do to get 13
to shave daily,” he wailed.

Vvhen asked what part to shave
first, the doctor became grave and
said, “That has always been a
moot question. If the tough part
comes first, the razor will be no
good for the rest. If the soft part
comes ﬁrst, one might end up with
a funny little tuft of the heavy re-
maining.”

He then suggested that raising
a goatee might be the solution.

An important meeting of the Con-

ment to the constitution making possi-
ble the procedure was passed by
unanimous vote. The action was
taken at a dinner meeting in the Kap-

night

Election of a new vice president
was made necessary by the resignation
of President Fred Edwards, C, and the
subsequent advance of Dale Van Or-
mer. C, to the office vacated by Ed-
wards.

A motion proposed by Willia.m Boli-
the to the effect that Druids should
cooperate with the YMCA in the com-
ing Student Chest drive also was giv-
en a unanimous vote by the organi-
zation. Bolitho was named by Van
Ormer to head the work.

Plans were made for dances in con
junction with Cwens, women’s sopho-
more honorary society. The Druid
group announced the dances would not.
be of the “tea dance” variety. In ac-
cordance with their plans, Druids will
use the name of “hop” in connection
with the proposed dances.

Reds‘To The Right Of Him——

AISING that old bogey to
frighten babes —— the red
shadow of bolsl1evism—the Uni-
versity of California at Los An-
geles has just suspended ﬁve stu-
dents for alleged radical activity,
while collegians at California uni-
versities fume.

Provost Ernest C. Moore of the
U .C.L.A. said the agitation re-
solved into the question of who
was running the university.

The university, says the Pro-
vost, is “a hotbed of com-
munism. ’ ’

Nevertheless. the suspension has
not had a cooling effect. At the
University of California in Berke-
ley 300 voted in favor of a one-
hour protest strike unless the ﬁve
are reinstated. From the Stan-
ford Daily came the charge that
the whole trouble was engendered
by state politics and that the uni-
versity authorities sought to pre-
vent an open forum discussion of
the state election.

“\Vhat are they trying to turn
out as graduates——gentlemen and
intelligent citizens or plain nin-
compoops?” the editorial de-
manded.

Probably it would t.a.ke the hys-I

teria of California ’s hydrophobic
political campaign to allow the se-
rious charge to be made that any
five students could have power
and inﬂuence enough “to destroy
the university by handing it over

in the past few ears, his dreams prob-
ably turn into nightmares.

But this nightmare so terrifying?
Is this mad era of nationalism neces-
sarily scaring off the dove of peace
and sounding discordant blare into in-
ternational harmony? That, of course,
is a nice question.

An overwhelming majority of econ-
omists, political scientists and other
intellectuals seem to view nationalism
with alarm. Only a very few have
dared to suggest that perhaps the
movement toward sectionalism has its
merits.

In the latter group are John May-
nard Keyncs, noted British economist,
and Wallace B. Donham, head of the
Harvard Graduate School of Business
Administration. Both gentlemen feel
that the days of free trade, no matter
how desirable they may have been
once, are now largely over. In this
stage of the game, international 1ais-
sez faire, they believe, would stir up
more trouble and confusion than it
would be worth to commercial pros-
perity,

Keynes has no faith in the manifest
destiny of the British people; Donham
shows no desire to die for the dear old

world peace and world prosperity.
Each thinks. though, that the way to.
attain these ends is for every country
to put its own house in order ﬁrst.
Oxford vs. Pitt

As is the quite usual habit with this
columnist, my mind is not made up
one way or the other in this problem
of internationalisni or nationalism for
the early twentieth century. I. too,
harbor dreams for the ultimate broth-
erhood of man and a parliament for
the world; but whether free trade or
protectionism is the better policy for

U. S. A, right or wrong. Each wants:

um this Thursday evening. A team
from Great Britain, representing the
creain of Oxford, will oppose Messrs.
McConkey and Goldberg, drawn from‘
the ‘top rank of Pitt intellectuals. The
topic will be, “Resolved: that the
abandonment of an isolationist policy
is essential to the return of American
prosperity.” England will support the
affirmative.

In other words, these University
men are going to t.hresl1 out this prob-
lem of internationalism versus nation-
alism as applied speciﬁcally to Amer
ica and her welfare. England proba-
bly will urge thai the United ‘States
lower her tariffs and join the League
of Nations, Pitt probably will advocate.
continuance of our present govern-
mental policy.

It should be an interesting discus-
sion. In Great Britain, public speak-
ing is an art, and the Oxford men un-
doubtedly will be skilled in that art.
And the Pitt debaters can talk too.
More important than quality of deliv-
ery, the question is a vital and press-
ing one,

The fact is ironic but true, that at
the University of Pittsburgh, the-one
class of people who do not attend the
intercollegiate debates here, are the
students themselves, Our forensic as
sociations appear before leagues of
women voters, business n1en’s clubs,
church groups and other organiza-
tions. They rarely appear on campus,
however. because undergraduates
show little interest. The fault. natu-
rally, may not lie with the students.

But the international debate this
Thursday night should be well worth
any Pitt man’s time. He will hear ex-
cellent speakers, a.nd undoubtedly get.
a new angle on this troublesome topic
of internationalism.

Panthers’ Power Brings
19-0 Defeat To Fighting
Iris_h__:_Before Big Crowd

N icksick,ShedloskyStar
As P i t t Outclasses
N otre Dame Team

By Charles A. Ruch
Even a genuine, imported shilalah,
such as the one an admirer gave to
Elmer Layden last Friday afternoon,
does not do the Irish any good when
the Nicksicks and the Shedloskys

take it into their heads to go scamper-

ing all up and down the ball ﬁeld with

a football tucked under one arm.
And when the Nicksicks and the

.Shedloskys are allied with a pack of

snarling Panthers it is not surprising
that even the ﬁghting Irish should go
down to a defeat such as the 19-0 one
which the Pitts smashed out over the
Notre Dames at the stadium Satur-
day.

From the time late in the first quar-
ter when Mike Nicksick slammed

through the Notre Dame line and]

broke away for a 51-yard run, only to
be halted on the nine by the speedy
entrance from backstage of one Wil-
liam Shakespeare, it was but a ques-
tion of what Pitt men would score
and how they would do it,

The ﬁrst payoff came in rather an
unexpected manner. Leon Shedlosky,
subbing for Bobby LaRue, caught 3.
Notre Dame punt on his own 42-yard
line and set sail for the Irish goal.
Tacking this wa.y and that, Shedlosky
eluded every Notre Dame man who
was not blocked out of the play and
came into port standing up. The total
length of the cruise was 58 yards.
Vveinstock missed the extra point.

Arnold Greene, sub quarterback,
snatched a stray Notre Dame pass on
the last play of the ﬁrst half and
eluded everything but the left side-
line on his long run down the ﬁeld.
He went out inside of the ﬁve-yard
line and the half was over_

Late in the third quarter Mike Nick-
sick got the urge to go again and
slashed down the ﬁeld for 46 yards
and another Pitt touchdown. At this
‘point Weinstock made good Pitt’s
ﬁrst point after touchdown in seven
tries. In all fairness, it must be said
that the work of at Notre Dame line-
man, who batted the ball along on its
way, did help.

Freshmen Get Tie
At Morgantown

Rally In Final Quarter After
Little Mountaineers Lead

Rallying in the fourth quarter after
being led, 14-O, by the West Virginia
frosh, the Panther freshmen scored
twice in ten minutes to bring out a
14-14 tie last Friday afternoon at the
Morgantown stadium.

The little Mountaineer team lived
up to its reputation for three quarters
by outplaying the
team, only to have their defense crack
in the ﬁnal quarter and allow the Pitt
yearlings two touchdowns to tie the
score.

From the starting whistle to the
ﬁnal gun the game was hard fought
and interesting, in many ways remin-
iscent of the Pitt-Minnesota varsity
affair several weeks ago. After a
ﬁrst quarter that was almost entirely
a punting duel, the West Virginia
team gained possession of the ball
on their own 45-yard line. Through
several long passes to Carder and
Huffman, and with some ﬁne line-
bucking by Kincaid, they took the
ball to the Pitt 12-yard line, from
which point Isaac romped around
right end for the ﬁrst touchdown.
Moan converted the extra point mak-
ing it 7-0, VVest Virginia, at the half.

In the third quarter, beginning
where they had left off, the little
Mountaineers scored again. Isaac be-
gan it by returning a Panther punt 35
yards to the Pitt 34-yard mark. Sev-
eral passes to Issac and another short
dash around right end by the same
player made it 13-0_ Moan once more
made good the conversion.

Now it was time for the Panthers
to strut their stuff. On the ﬁrst play
of the ﬁnal quarter Urban intercept-
ed a Mountaineer pass on his own 12-
yard line and romped 88 yards for
Pitt’s ﬁrst touchdown. Souchak kick-
ed the extra point but the Panthers
were still behind, 14-7.

Nine minutes later Schmidt recov-

ered a VVest Virginia fumble on the
Mountaineer 41-yard line and the Pitt

Aside from these ﬂurries, the game
held little else but freak plays and
forward passes that went wrong.
For the Irish it was Bill Shakespeare
who put on the best performance. Be-

‘Shakespeare turned in a 22-yard run

The play of Pitt’s guards, Captain

factor in erasing the Erin men from

Down Irish Team
By Perfect Score

To Gain Revenge For Loss
Su.ﬁ‘ered Last Season

Coach Carl Olson’s Panther har-
riers created a mild upset by white-
washing Notre Dame's runners, 15-40,
in a dual meet Saturday morning over
the Schenley Park course. The vic-
tory atoned for a loss to the Irish last
year,

Three Pitt hill—and-dalers crossed
the line abreast to give the local
team a good start. These runners
were Ken Wagenhouser, Charles Kirk-
patrick, and Sam Musico. Following
these three men home were Harold
Tost and Bill Albright, giving Pitt 3.
clean sweep of the ﬁrst ﬁve positions.

Shortly after the start of the race,
VVagenhouser, Kirkpatrick, Musico,

the ﬁrst three held throughout. Their
time was 24 minutes and 23 seconds.

McGrath was the ﬁrst Notre Dame
ma.n to complete the three and three-
;fourths mile course, his time being 25
The other
lplaces were captured by Lee, Kenyon,
lMcKenna, and McDevitt, all of Notre
}Dame.
' The Irish team, weakened by the
loss of two of their lettermen for this
meet, came to Pittsburgh with but
one varsity man on the team. The
remainder of the team was made up
- of three sophomores, a track man who
stars in distance events, and a re-
serve.

.Prior to S-aturday’s meet the Irish
had split even in two contests, losing
to Michigan State and beating Loyola.

WSCA Committee Closes

Freshman Customs Rules

“Customs committee has enjoyed
working with the freshman women
because of their willingness to com-
ply with regulations and the friendly
spirit they have shown on campus,”
declared Roberta Nern, Ed36, chair-
man of customs committee of WSGA.
“The manner In which the class of
1938 has followed customs rules has
helped them get better acquainted on
campus and helped upperclassmen to
know them better,” Miss Helen Rush,
assistant dean of women, stated at
the end of the restriction period Fri-
day.

Freshman women discarded their
arm bands on Friday as customs reg-
ulations were concluded. The rules
were more closely adhered to and
customs tests -were passed with higher
grades than ever before.

English Themes
Provide Laughs
For Instructors

 

“The Cabinet of ll-Iorrors” is no rem-
nant of feudal times, but merely a col-
lection of ridiculous excerpts from

freshman themes.. Each English in-I
structor contributes the best exam-I
ples from his classes, and there is
much bartering and trading among the

professors for the really funny sen

tences. ~

The following sentences are derived

from the honest efforts of well-mean-
ing English students:

_ “A moving truck was stolen on Sher-

idan avenue. It was left unguarded‘
by the driver who went into a restau-

rant for dinner and later was found
empty in Schenley park.”

“Rising 472 feet in the air, I saw the

Cathedral of Learning.”

Freshmen need not grieve over this

exploitation of their efforts, for ac-
cording to members of the English de—

partment, famous authors have also
unconsciously made a serious situation

ridiculous. Mary Roberts Rinehart

in her book “My Story," wrote: “Wi-
dowed early with ﬁve children, com-
pletely untrained—with no openings
outside of school teaching for women

in those days, she fell back on her

needle.”

This article is meant for a warning

to English students,‘ who. though they

may seek eternal fame through writ-
ing, would rather not be remembered
for contributions to the “Cabinet of
Horrors.’’

 

Miss Anderson To Speak

Tomorrow afternoon, Miss Isabelle
S. Anderson, assistant dean of wo-
men, will address the Crafton Junior
VVon1en’s club. She will discuss “High-
lights in the Education of Women in
Pennsylvania.”

 

The Pitt News

Night Life Fashions Go Medieval
With Robe-de-style Formal Gowns

 

By Sarah Harris

“Night life” is the theme of the
Fashion Reporter, mimeographed style
bulletin published semi-monthly by
the Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing, which comes out today.

Night life fashions cover full eve-
ning dress (evening gowns suitable
for a formal dance, the opera, or any
occasion when the escort wears
“tails”), and little evening dress
(dresses for informal dances, the the-
atre, and “at-home.”)

The formal evenmg gown shows the
robe-de—style inﬂuence particularly;
any gown adapted from a historic
period is termed “robe-de-style.” The
Renaissance gown is silk and sump-
tuous; the Directoire gown is simple,
has high waist lines, low decolletage,
and often ﬁchus and capelets; and
the Southern belle (or Mid-Victorian)
dress uses an off-the-shoulder neck-
line. Most of the dresses resemble
God-ey prints, the latest fashions
boasting uneven hcms and peg-top
skirts. Skirts are slit, after the Nap-
oleonic mode, “to give a fleeting
glimpse of the leg.”

Any fabric that swishes is good for

{evening wear; moire, faille and bro-
cade are perfect for the

style gowns. Among the emphasized

rather be svelte and sophisticated in
black, glittering ornaments must be
worn to accent the sombre color.
Gold and silver sandals follow the
extravagant mode, as do the evening
bags.

Evening wraps, also elegant and in
the current period styles, range from
ankle or instep—length coats to jackets
and capes. “Capes ﬁt in beautifully
with the bouffant period gowns, and
the little maribou (feather down)
capelets can make straight slip
dresses most dramatic.”

Gloves vary in length to suit the
gown, and may be velvet, lame or
black satin if one wishes to “look
very sleek." The Fashion Reporter al-
so stresses the importance of large
ibracelets, clips and pins in trans-
iforming a simple, dress to a bright,
colorful one. “Everything in access-
ories must dazzle and flatter after the
wearer,” concludes “Your Fashion Re-
porter.”
