Rationing Affects
Pitt Commuters

-Gas rationing has forced nearly
ﬁfty per cent of the University’s
student body to change their
method of transportation to school,
according to the student opinion
poll recently conducted by the SFA
statistics committee. A special
transportation committee will be
probably appointed by SFA soon
to see what can be done about this
serious problem. .

The poll, which included 15% 0

of the students and was taken by
the sampling technique, showed
that 63.1% of the students would
be willing, if they had cars, to
pool them if gas were made avail-
able. Only 29.4% said they would
be unwilling, and 1.7% said they
didn’t know. Of those who have
been forced to change their
means of travel, 55.2% now come
to school on the street car, 19.1%
walk, 16.5% take the bus and
10.3% use trains.

The committee would like stu-
dents that are having difficulty

adequately served by existing

Countess Zamoiska Opens
W/omen's Day Assembly

Next Thursday is Women’s Day at Pitt. “This year instead of the
usual interclass sing, the Women’s Self-Government Association is
sponsoring a series of meetings concerning “women’s place in a world
at war,’” Alma Nicholas, vice president of WSGA and chairman of the

day, announces.

A general assembly of all Pitt
women in Stephen Foster Mem-
orial will open the day’s program
at 1:30 o’clock. Countess L. I. V
Zamojska, head of the Women’s
Interests of the United Nations
Information Oflice, will speak on
“Women in the United Nations.”

Vocational conferences on ﬁelds

E in which women are urgently need-

ed today and for which they may
prepare themselves at the Univer-
sity have been scheduled for the

hour following the assembly.

Experts from the various ﬁelds
and faculty members will conduct
these conferences. The ﬁelds to be
covered are: industrial chemistry,
medicine, meteorology and weather
forecasting, engineering, business,
government service, journalism,
nursing, social work, teaching, re-
tailing, physics and mathematics,
linuguistics, the armed forces, and
Engineering Science and Math War
Training Courses.

After the hour conferences, all
women are invited to have tea
either on the twelfth -ﬂoor, or in
the Commons Room. The confer-
ence leaders will be on the
twelfth floor and will lead infor-
mal discussions during the social
hours. The Countess will be served
in the Commons Room and will
9 meet students who congregate
there. »

“Countess Zamojska should have
a lot of interesting information for
us," stated Alma Nicholas. The
Countess who was born in the
Western Islands of Scotland spent
the years 1936 to 1939 in Poland.
With a two-year-o-ld child, she
lived through the seige of Warsaw
and left Poland in December, 1939,
at the time of German occupation.
In September, 1940, the Countess
arrived in the United States and
from then until May, 1941, she lec-
tured in Western United States on
the war. V

Even for the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph,
last Monday’s’ editorial reprinted in part to
the‘ left, was particularly bad. Ill timed, (it
came just when Russian gains to the North
brought hope and cheer to all ﬁghters of the
United Nations). the editorial can only serve
to weaken American-Russian solidarity, so
vital in achieving ﬁnal military victory.

Instead of hinting at some sort of a cellar-
hatched plot between Russian premier Stalin
and Vice-President"Wallace to communize the
world, we think it’s about time that the Sun-
Telegraph and others like it realized that we
are at war against Fascism, the Fascists, and
those countries where they have grabbed
power.

And by smearing Wallace with. the Com-
munist label, the Tele is obviously trying to
keep the Vice-president and his far—sighted

. post-war plans from a seat at the peace table.

By calling international government “inter-

national communism” the Tele would have us

Eeturn to the old pre-Roosevelt isolationist
ays.

By repeating the Goebbels-Franco line that
this is a war between Communism and
Fascism——and by insisting that Communism
is a greater threat to America than is Fas-
cism——the Tele makes itself all too clear as
to what it would like the future ideology of
America to be.

By assuming that Wallace’s “psychological
pol1cing” of the conquered axis will end in
Communism, the Tele implies that it is better
to have no policingiat a1l—the United States
remaining idle in ' the face of a renascent
Fascism.

It iseditorials like the one in Monday’s
Sun-Telegraph that make us wonder why the
American people haven’t yet awakened’ to the
realization that it must someday rid itself
of its own variety of sand-lot Hitlers, as well
as those of Germany, Italy, and Japan.

RETIRING SPORTS EDITOR

It’s tough to say goodbye. But to all good things there
must eventually come an end and this is my valedictory as
sports editor of The Pitt News.

Even on the Pitt News, a sportswriter is bound to remem:

eber a few things after four years’ work. He winds up four
«years .with a queer jumble of memories——people, -incidents,
dull days, exciting days, and a great many days that were
“just ordinary.

We remembered people most often, people like Frank
Carver and Robert X. Graham and Charley Bowser and

 ’ Ralph Mitterling and Jimmy Hagan and Doctor Carlson

and Tom Hopkins. And Ken George in Columbus, Ohio,
when he made the mistake of giving us the room across
from Bowser, a person who had originally planned to get
some sleep.

We like to think about the surprised expressions that

fthe New York sportswriter had on that bleak Saturday after-

‘noon when the clawless Panthers rose to life and punctured

the Fordham Rose Bowl balloon.

. And that afternoon when the downtown “rumor facto-

, by ries” whipped up a story on Pitt entering the Big Ten Confer-
h.__ence. They didn’t though, and the News, after interviewing
I . Major Griﬂith, commissioner of the Western Conference who
was in town ‘speaking at the homecoming banquet, was
 credited with having the only true account of the incident that

I appeared in any Pittsburgh newspaper.

_ We like to think about the day the Pitt News staged
- a surprise “pep rally’-’ before last year’s Duke game. Also
that morning, one year later, when we told the student
body, “Right now, there are a few things bigger than
football. There are arenas of battle much larger than our
Stadium, and objectives much more important than the
crossing of a goal line.”
. It is hard to forget that evening in the Pitt pavillion when
Dr. Carlson and the West Virginia Mountaineers put on a
great show for the spectators. The Hill-Billys looked great

i that night as Dick Kesling tied the individual scoring mark

held by Pitt’s Eddy Straloski.
And then there was the time this year when the -Pitt

 — gridders completely outplayed and outclassed a superior Great
~;Lakes team only to falter in the closing minutes. They showed
‘la lot of ‘great ball playing that day, but kept it hidden the

remainder of the season.

There was the swimming meet between Michigan
= State and the Panther mermen. Michigan camehere ex-
pecting an easy victory, but Captain Wilde’s sensational
last minute spurt in the ﬁnal race of the evening sent the

visitors home satisﬁed with a tie.

We like to tell about Carter and Stickel and Davis and

 Rhoades. And the day that cocky Barney Ewell of Penn State

walked out on the cinders, telling everyone that he would
break the world’s record in one of his specialties. Everyone
smiled courteously, but he did.

. Also the afternoon when rain washed out all the activities

.s_at West Point, but this didn’t stop the rival coaches. Both

Coach Carl Olson and the West Pointer walked out to the

' center of the ﬁeld, in the rain, and tossed coins for each race.
If Olson called it right, Pitt won the race. If the West Point

mentor called the turn of the coin, his boy won the race. That

_Was one day the trackmen could blame their coach for the loss.

Basball had its moments. That day two years ago
when Pitt’s powerful nine paced by Bonelli, Guadagnino,
Jones, Malloy, and Straloski grinded out 24 runs to
trounce the once-beaten Nittany Lions.

We remember that evening last year when Dr. Carl-
son used his varsity men as guinea pigs, drawing blood
from their arms before the Tech contest. He wondered
if it would have any effect. It had.

. The week-ends that we took trips with the football squad
only to ﬁnd several collect telegrams waiting for us in the
hotel annoyed us no end. They were all from Editor Irwin
Rosen, wishing us a pleasant trip, good health, a few touch-
downs, etc. ’
’ , Elaine Kahn, who did such an admirable job of cover-
. ing baseball last spring, will take it from here. She is
O stepping into a tough job, but we know she will make a
. grand sports editor. To Jerry Ripp and Mike Herman and
. Sheme Bazell and Earl Surloff and Paul Palanzo, we say
~ thanks, you were all swell.
Sheme Bazell will be leaving with us. He was a fine,

pttwilling, loyal worker and his witty anecdotes always made
the sports pages a little more readable. The last time we saw.

Sheme he was walking toward the Carnegie Library with a
. most depressed look on his face and a lunch pail under his arm.
Which reminds me.

Bazell Sniffs Farewells,

Gets Maudlin, Cries Glbye

By SHEME BAZELL

Around this here now Pitt News
ofﬁce, there’s a rumor current that
its farewell column time. Said
rumor can be directly traced to the
gentlemen, Zelenski and Ripp,
whose bye-bye droolings should
easily top any river bank overﬂow
endured heretofore by smoky city
citizenry. " ,

So in self-defense, and to keep
the tide high . . .

Insigniﬁcant incidents move fore-
m.ost into the lens of retrospection.
There was the day when the won-
ders of a grid game from the Press
Box were ﬁrst unfolded. How we
tried without being too obvious,‘to
ﬂash that Press pass to any and all
comers. But nobody seemed to
share our elation.

At the game, there wasn’t a move
made by Chet Smith, or Havey
Boyle, or Harry Keck, or Tom Hop-
kins that escaped the pop-eyed
vigil of this amoebic pencil pusher.
But before the sixty—minute gun

, sounded, we discovered that the

sports scribing fourth estaters
were in actuality no more wonder-
ous than the folk on the outer side
of the press box enclosure. Only
one difference was obvious; Smith
and company were paid to work,
Joe fan paid to play.

That was the‘day too-, we were
afraid to partake of the gratis half-
time. oﬁerings of cokes‘ and sand-
wiches by the Pitt publicity depart-
ment. First we wondered what they
cost. Then we feared to accept the
gift because we weren’t really
“working” there among the work-
ing press men. We were only gawk-
mg_ ._ _

. Surloﬁ‘, George

It was while working for the Pitt
News, that this nostalgic ex-News-
man, suffered one of life’s biggest
little miseries. We missed out in the
battle for Sports Editor of this
publication. Nothing mattered any-
more. Foreign Legion applications
were mailed. But that little hurt
soon healed. And we can’t help but
think that Alex Zelenski, in being
just a downright great guy, had
much to do with the process.

People, too, ﬂash across a remin-
iscing backdrop. Bill McElwain . . .
spot him for a top slot among
sports scribes, when the duration’s
end -brings that expected spurt in
sports. Jean Thoms . . . the lady
can’t miss some ten years hence.
She, too, will carry top honors and I
do much for the fair sex in this
masculine journalistic profession.-
And those aren’t mere predictions.

Of Alex Zelenski, whose tears
are byinow ﬂowing quite freely at
the taps to our left, we’ve already
spoken. He’s a top-notcher in any
league, and you can take that from
A to Z. And Jerry Ripp who moves
from campus to khaki next week,
has plenty to start on (see below)
in the verb circuit, when the world
situation permits him to don civies
once again.

There’s Mike Herman, Irwin
Rosen, Charley Camarata, Earl
Chirigos, Tom
Barr, Lois Galbreath, Seymour
Kerber, Elaine Kahn, Irv Kaufman,
Bob Machesney, Bob Graham,

It was in that game that the Pan-

in that game that they saw the

most amazing ball-handler to ap- 

pear on the Stadium ﬂoor in many

a year. That was Scotty Hamilton, R 
who is back to plague the boys with x A

his tricky passes and ﬂoor play.

Take it from us, our boys are in 

for a very tough evening.

and came out on the. short end of
the score in a game they should
have won.

It was just a case of a superior O

team throwing away a ball game

at the foul line, for it can be truth- I A -

fully said that the Panthers would
have waltzed away with the lion’s

share had they been more accurate ,7

inside the circle.

Tay Malarkey, who is probablyigj
P‘itt”s best all-around-player, alone, _

missed 7 out of 12 tries.

Of their defense, Dr. Carlson will : ;

’ Our registration card says ‘‘class
of 1944.” Two weeks ago we re-
ceived a letter from the president
of the United States stating that
he had advanced us to the class of
January 14, 1943.

There are lots of things welll re-
member about Pitt. But the thing
that will remain "with us longer
than anything else is the Pitt News
and the swell gang we worked with
in the past two and a half years. ,

It wasn’t all glory and by-lines.
‘It was frost-bitten ears from
watching intramural f o o t b_a»l 1
games during a snow storm; going
home to a cold dinner; trying to get
a story from a coach that wouldn’t
talk; and trudging up the 185 steps
(we counted them one day) from
Pitt drive to Trees gym three times
a week during our freshman year.

Writing sports for the Pitt News
had its rewards too. Rewards in
knowing people like Frank Carver‘,
Doc Carlson, Bill McElwain, James
Hagan, Bob Graham and Bob Mc-
Chesney; rewards in gaining the
lasting friendship of someone like
Sheme Bazell; sitting in a warm
press box during rainy ‘football
days when the rest of the student
body were drenched; getting to-
gether after the paper was put to
bed for a glass of beer and ‘a real
bull session. All these were the
rewards" that no amount of money
could buy.

We’ll have lots of memories from
these happy days. There was the
time when we were a freshman and

watched the Punks swamp another
intramural team in a driving rain-
storm. We got back to the oﬂice
literally frozen. Our ﬁngers were so
stiff from the cold we weren’t able
to type for nearly “an hour. When
the paper came out the story had
been cut from seven inches to one
sentence.

That didn’t stop us however. We
kept going up those 185 steps three
times a week till we became a
sophomore. Better assignments fol-
lowedthen until this year when we
had the football and basketball
beats.

Now we’ve come to the end of the
trail. Its a premature ending, but
there is a job to be done and the
sooner it’s ﬁnished the sooner
everything will be back to normal
again. .

To Elaine Kahn and Mike Her-
man who remain behind to struggle
with.the sports page, the best of
luck.

To Alex Zelenski, who is leaving
for the armed service too, here’s
hoping we meet somewhere “over
there.” ‘-

To Sheme Bazell, who is taking
Horace Greeley’s advice and goes
West next week, all the success and

their pictures taken. Pictures will
be taken on campus Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday, January
