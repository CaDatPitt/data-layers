That students are taking an inter-
est in the candidacy of Dr. L. K.
lvlanley for congressman from the
Thirty-ﬁfth District is evidenced by
the fact that they are circulating pe-
titions to place his name; on Both
Republican and Democratic ballots in
the May primary. Students are not
circulating the petitions, but those
eligible as voters in the district, are
signing them. Dr. Manley, it was
said on Monday, had not ﬁled his
papers at Harrisburg, -but enough sig-
natures had been obtained by that
time to place his name on both ballots.

  PLANS Fllll FUNIITIBNS

The Beaver County Club. is ‘active
on the campus this year for the first
time, since the war. This organiza-
tion was very prominent in campus
affairs before war conditions pre-
vailed. Last spring students from
the Valley endeavored , to bring the
organization back to life‘, and about
twenty-ﬁve members were enrolled.
School ended before action was really
started.‘ , . ‘,

‘With the opening . of this school
term, the club became active at once.
About thirty-ﬁve’, members are en-
rolled and there are still many eli-
gibles who have not "yet signed up.
Any ‘student whose residence is in
Beaver County ‘and who is carrying
twelve credit hours in the University
is eligible for membership. Meetings
are ‘held the third Wednesday of each
month in Room 102 Alumni Hall at
11:50.1 .

The following officers have been
elected to serve for the ensuing yearz‘

OLYMPIC THEATRE

Week of April 1A0th—--“Stick to Logic”
Advises Tom Terris to Makers
of Mystery Pictures

Tom Terris, who directed “Find the
Woman’? featuring Alma Rubens
which will be shown at the Olympic
Theatre this week, says he solved the
murder mystery in this Arthur Som-
ers Roche story by regular police
methods and not by an arbitrary so-
lution arrived at simply to end the
picture. ’

Mystery pictures, explains Mr. Ter-
ris, “are the betes noires of the
screen. How many times have you
seen one that really mystiﬁed you?
I pause for an answer, which, of
course is “seldom” the trouble has

‘ ‘been the producers have permitted

the scenario writers and directors to
fall downon sustaining the -suspense
and the uncertainty as to who com-
mitted the crime, for a long time it
was thought necessary to take the
audience into conﬁdence while keep-.
ing the cast in the dark,~that, natural-
ly, was ineffective.

In preparing the scenario of “Find
the Woman” Doty Hobart Wdrked out
his denouement -logically after point-
ing the ﬁn-ger of suspicion «ﬁrst at this
person and then at that. When it
came to revealing the murder he did
not resort to the convenient confes-
sion, but so deftly wove his script
that the clever detective ran down
every available clue and ﬁnally trail-
ed his quarry by scientiﬁc means, but
means that are -undeniably credible
and reasonable.  ,

‘ Mr. Terrie has an excellent cast
in this production. In addition to
Miss Rubens, the principl are Eileen
Huban, George 'MacQuarr1e,- Harrison
Ford, Norman ‘Kerry, “Ethel Duray,
Henry Sedly and Sydney Deane.

U
The Pitt debaters met defeat at
the hands of the Syracuse crew at
the Crouse College auditorium in the
inter-collegiate debate series last
week. Both teams showed extensive
preparation and made creditable
showings. The decision was rendered
by the judges-H..P. Dennison, a Syra-
cuse attorney; Attorney Thomas Dix-
on, and Reverend George Middleton
of the Calvary Baptist Church of

Syracuse. It was a twopto one in
favor of Syracuse.

The subject of the debate was, “Re-
solved, that it should , be the policy
of the United States to claim full
payment of the debts owed her by
the Allied nations. ,The affirmative
side of ~ the question was upheld by
the Pitt team which was represented
by John M. Walker, H. Russell Stabl-
man and. John S. Truxall. Irving
Kennedy, Everett Schuls and J. ‘ 0.
Murray represented Syracuse.
='Deal William Bray of Syracuse pre-
sided.
The cﬁrstv speaker of the,evening
was John D. S. Truxall who opened
the constructive argument for the'af-
ﬁrmative and the Pitt team. In his
speech he emphasized the point that

gation to Europe to cancel the debt.
The debts were incurred under per-
feet legal conditions so no legal obli-
gation exists. ‘The negative admitted
this point. The United States bore
its just and proportionate share of
the war’s cost, both in ﬁnancial. and.
human losses. While we were in the-
war we excelled our Allies in losses.
There then exists no moral obligation
to cancel. There does exist a moral
and- a legalobligation on the part
of our government to demand pay-
ment of this debt to the American
'citizen. It washis dollars and his
Liberty loans which made this assist-
ance to the Allies possible. If Eu-
rope does not pay then the American
citizen must. A _ l

The negative argument was opened
by J.*'O. Murray of Syracuse Uni-
versity whose attack was rather ‘weak
and not convincive. We contended
that the Allies were unable. to pay
the debt either now or in the future.
If the Allies cannot pay, what is the
advantage in claiming payment of
the debt? ‘ I

John M. Walker then spoke in be-
half of the affirmative .with his pro-
gressive persuasiveness and conﬁ-
dence. John made clear that the Al-
lies had the means of payment. “In
the first place they desire to pay
their debts.” This he proved by
quoting from the official statements
of the foreign governments.. '

C. Everett Shults then’ continued
the direct argument for the negative
-by showing that the only means of
payment was through the importa-

he said, would be detrimental to the
economic interests of the United
States. American business would fail
because of the flooding of the Ameri-
can markets-with cheap foreign goods.

was closed in its constructive aspect
by H. Russell Stahlmann whose main
contention was that it was to the do-
mestic industrial interests of Amer-
ica to acceptpayment of the debts
in the form above mentioned namely,
goods. This in accord with the af-
ﬁrmative plan of payment as set
forth by John Walker, the further ex-
tension of credit under supervision

industry of Europe to function again
and forward to America goods in
payment for those she is now‘ receiv-
ing and which are so vital to stable
employment and prosperity on this
side of the Atlantic. If such
payment is demanded the equi-
librium of a -trade balance could
be reached all over the world and
then money would approach par
value and the maximum purchasing
power of the world’s currencies would
be attained. Then the world market.
would be again guaranteed to the
American producer.

The first ‘student program meeting

Monday noon in room 215 Alumni

bers read a paper entitled, “Jewish
Problems and Their ‘Possible Solu-
tions." This was followed -by a round
table discussion. 0

In the reading, Mr. Pitler made
special reference to two distinct prob-
lems. The external problem consisted
of‘ prejudice of other peoples which
has developed into Anti-Semitism.
The internal problem consisted of
prejudice among the Jewish people
themselves, especially between the
strict orthodox and radical reform
groups. He brought out the two so-
lutions which are commonly referred
In
mentioning assimilation he said that
it did not necessarily mean intermar-
riage, but might be merely social as-
similation. The other solution was
hampered by the inability to secure

rious trouble especially from the Mos-
lems.

Because they have the capacity to understand
the vital economic necessity of Life Insurance,

Their education, and social standing, is in keep-

The need of Life Insurance prevails wherever

people live, and ambitious college men need not

sever the home relationships in the establishment
of a permanent business.

to the large minds of business, and they have op-

portunity for creating’ markets, which would

  IIISIEUSSES PRIIBLEMS

The accounting faculty of the
Evening School of Economics, Ac-
counts and Finance met last Wednes-
day at a luncheon held in the Cham-
ber of Commerce dining room.

Plans were made to correlate the
accounting methods‘ offered in the
Evening School curriculum. By this
method, new students enrolling in ac-
counting courses will know just
what grade of accounting to study,
thereby placing all students in the
particular class according to their
qualiﬁcations.

The meeting of the faculty “was
pronounced a success and the many
constructive suggestions offered it ‘is
expected should prove valuable to
future, enrollment in the Evening
‘School accounting course.

Clubs at their home last Friday even-
ing. Classical quotations of a. serious
and humorous character and Latin
songs in chorus were features. Miss
O’Donnel,' with her piano solos, Miss
Bartholomew and- Miss Allen with
their songs, added greatly to the en-
joyment of the evening. ‘

The main feature of the evening
was an address by Dr. Alfred Emer-
son, recently curator of Classical An-
tiquities of the Chicago School of Fine
Arts. His subject was, “To Athens
‘and On,” in which he gave an ac.
count of hig experiences as an arch-

The classical club has selected the

. A LITTLE DOPE  

V “COMMEVRGIALIS-Mi’ ;lN VGOLVLEGE ATHLETICS
The periods in college athletics between the close of the football season

ball and the opening of »theVbaseba;ll and track seasons are more or less.off-
seasons so far as actual happenings. ln*theL realm of sport are concerned.
However, such periods are generally fruitful in the production of n1LewV ideas,
theories, and suggestions for the improvement of college sports. Such pro-V
posalsgafford much food for; discussion and it is -altogether right that they
should, forif there is any good in them afavorable attitude toward them
Is.thereby_c.reated, while if they are wrought with defects, the weaknesses-

better. V

Two sets of suggestions -havereceived publicity in theLpresent off-season,
which have attracted the attention of.Vall interested in college athletics. The
one we want to discuss is that coming from the Lpresideht of “Amherst ‘Col-
lege, summarized brieﬂy by “stuc|V¢nt playing, student Tmanagement, and stu-
dent coaching." This is obviously but an»expresVsiVonV in more con'creVte form

itself practically without a javelin
thrower, while ininost of the Lmeets
this season there is a jaivelin event,
a fraternity javelin throwing compe-
tition will be held on Trees Field this
Friday. The winning fraternity will
‘be determined just as in the events
in the Indoor 'I‘raLck,V the throws of
the ﬁve best men being averaged for
the fraternityL’s score. Because of the
sore need of the, track team for a
jairelin thrower, the fraternities are
asked to co-operate in this event as
they did in the indoor events and get
‘as many men out as possible. ~The

event and any man who has a -good
baseball_ arm should with little prac-
tice be able to throw the thinga good
distance. ' L V
Director Miller announces that a
trophy will be awarded to the win-
ning. fraternity, provided the fratern-

javelin is not a particularly diﬁ‘i"cultL

cause that only will.» insure the“ suc-_

ances is not sufficievnt to justify it.
It isalso possible that a small trophy
will -be given the individual winner
although that is not assured as yet.
It is practically a certa.inLty, how-
e‘v’eI‘.L that any man who does close to
150 feet with the javelin will be taken
with the track team on its southern
trip. Capt, Hewitt of the track team
has done around 130 feet‘ with the
javelin and any man that beats him
by ten feet should stand a chance of
getting the trip. T
