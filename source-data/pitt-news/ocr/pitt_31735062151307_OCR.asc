Council Heads
Are Selected

Interfraternity Chairmen
For 1932-33 Named ‘

Nominations for the chairman-
ships of the athletic, social and
rushing committees of Interfraten
nity Council for next  were
made last Tuesday evening at the
regular meeting of the council at
the Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity
house. '

The executive committee of the
council will meet early next semes-
ter and select the chairmen from
the group which was nominated:
Morris Harris, Phi Epsilon Pi;
Leroy Lewis, Phi Gamma Delta;
William Young, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon; Richard Wettach, Kappa. Sig-
ma; Peter Pingetore, Alpha Phi
Delta; Edward McBride, Phi
Kappa; Wayne
Delta Psi; Harlow White, Phi
Delta Theta; Leroy Erickson, Delta
Tau Delta; and Charles Hugus,
Theta Delta Psi. ‘

The council is considering re-
organizing its program next year.
Instead of buying cups for the fra-
ternities winning out in different
sports it is thinking of establish-
ing an “Intramural Program.” A
certain number of points will be
given to the fraternity coming in
first, second and third in any event
sponsored by the council. Then,

at the end of the semester, the
fraternity having the most number
of points will get one cup. Frater-
nities coming in second and third
also receive cups. This will elimi-
nate the necessity of buying cups
for the winning fraternities in. each
event and also equalize the compe-
tition among all the fraternities.
The council is also considering
sponsoring an “Inter-fraternity
Sing" next year at which the fra-
ternities will have certain mem-

 

 

bers represent them at the meet»

ing and have them sing the fra-
ternity songs. The fraternity
whose songs will be judged best
will be adequately rewarded.

Women Vote
On Customs
At Induction

Eight Activities Install
Officers A At Joint
Service Monday

 

 

At the installation of officers of
the major women's campus organ-
izations next Monday evening in
‘Heinz House, members of W. S. G.
A. will vote on the important
change in the organization of cus-
toms enforcement for next year;
that of having juniors as well as
sophomores "serve ‘on - the «commit-
tee.

Under the new‘p1an each year-

a number of the members of cus-
toms committee will be held over
to serve with the incoming sopho-
mores on the next year's commit-
tee. The majority however, will
consist of sophomores. Inaddition
the chairman of customs will be
chosen by the executive committee
of W. S. G. A., and will be a jun-
ior.

The advantages of this system
are listed by W. S. G. A. heads. In
the first place, junior women hav-
ing had more acquaintance with
Pitt traditions, will have a broader
outlook, on the meaning of cus-
toms. Then. since customs are a
project of W. S. G. A.. it is more
fitting that a larger part ofthe
organization should participate. in
their enforcement.

Like: New System 4»
" Edith Baschen; "p'resident« of-“W.

S. G..A.. says of the new Plan! “I

think this system will work out
much better. The freshman some-
times dislikes the idea of a class
just above them “lording its-over"
them. Wlth juniors on the commit-
tee, as well as sophomores, this
feeling will be done away with."

Ruth Hamilton, Ed. '33, next
year's vice-president of W. S. G. A.
and a former customs chairman.
comments: “Since ‘the juniors on
the committee will have more ex-
perience, they will be able to give
some valuable suggestions to the
sophomores. You will also get the
backing of both classes."

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, will make the introductory
speech to commemorate the initial
joint installation. Edith Hirsch,
Ed. '32, will serve as mistress of
ceremonies.

WSGA.‘Adds
Committees

Plan To Include Survey,
Senior Dress Group

 

Two new committees are being
added to W. S. G. A. commission
next fall; the Survéy and Senior
Dress Committees. The first is for
the purpose of making surveys to
assist the office of the Dean of
Women, while the latter is intend-
ed to standardize the commence-
ment costumes of graduating wo-
men. ’

Projected problems for study by
the Survey committee including the
obtaining _of statistics on the am-
ount of money spent by ‘college
girls each ye-a.r fonclothes, the num-
ber of hours spent in study each
week and the time spent in activi-
ties and gainful occupations.

For the last three years the
Senior Dress Committee has been
a part of the Senior Class, but the
new executive committee of W, S,
G. A. has decided that it would be
wiser to return to theold practice
of having that committee a part
of W.’ S. G. A. Commission. In
this way the standard for com-
mencement clothes will remain
the same from year to year. The
committee ‘will make a study of
clothes suitable for commence-
ment, perhaps issuing a pamphlet
on the subject and sponsoring a
fashion show.

Fraternities To Comply
With Rule By 1935

 

By 1935 all §women's fraternity
competition resulting from campus
prestige based on the size and
wealth,_ of a fraternity will have
completely disappeared’, according
to thjaﬁdecreeﬁ recently passed by
‘Panhellenic Council that all”wo-
men's fraternities will number
twenty-four members by that date.
This count will be taken each year
before rushing season and initia-
tion ln the spring.

This decree inccrporated in a
series of by-laws approved at the
last meeting of Council is as yet
the most serious ‘step taken in the
Panhellenic program to eliminate
fraternity competition and estab-

' lish ideal interfraternalism.

A Tax Membership
Panhellenic dues have also been
placed on a sliding scale in order
to lessen the financial burden on
small fraternities which ﬁnd it
necessary to otherwise increase
their budgets in the campaign to
increase their membership in ac-
cordance with the by-law. Begin-
ning next semester Panhellenic
dues. will be "twenty dollars for
fraternities with ‘fifteen members
or less and two dollars for each
additional riember in place of the
previous flat assessment of thirty
dollars. _   

The inclusion of committee chair-
men in the executive board of Pan-
hellenic Council, the replacement
of silent representatives to Coun-
cil with associate representatives
who have a voice but no vote, the
definite statement of the duties of
Panhellenic officers not previously
included in’ the Panhellenic Con-
stitution, and other minor moves"
concerning the parliamentary pro-
cedure in order at Council meetings
were also presentel by Betty Quar-
rie, Col. '34, chairman of the By-
Laws Committee, and approved as
by-laws of the Panhellenic Associ-
ation.

ce Ruling

 

Beginning in September, 1932,
the School of Education of the
University of Pittsburgh will be
organized as an upper division, pro-
fessional school, admitting stu-
dents from a pre-education curri-
culum in the college, at the end of
the sophomore year. Announce-
ment concerning this plan was

imade recently through the offices

of the dean following approval by
the board of trustees.

Admission to the School of Edu-
cation will be based upon a num-
ber of criteria, some of which have
not been definitely determin . As
these criteria will not have to be
applied until September, 1934, the
faculty will have plenty of time for
experimentation.

Tentative bases for the admis-
sion of students to the school from
the pre-education curriculum have
been indicated by a committee of

. the faculty charged with the details

of the plan. These are: (1) Better
than average in scholarship, (2) a
superior rating in the subject, of a

’ student's major interest, (3) a phy-

sical examination, (4) demonstrat-
ed ability in a try-out course, (5)
intelligence, aptitude, and English
tests, (6) personal interview.
Students new registered in the
School of Education will be permit-
ted to continue and will be grad-

. yuated under the regulations exist-
ing prior to the adoption of

the
new plan. Freshmen, entering in
September, 1932, who desire to
prepare for the teaching profession
will be registered in the College
in a specially designated pre-edu-

cation curriculum.

The pre-education curriculum,
which will be administered with

1 the advice of the faculty of the

School of" Education, will be in
conformity with the general plan
of teacher preparation, but will en-
able 9. student, who fails to satisfy
aldmlssion requirements to the
School of Education by the end of
the sophomore year, to continue to
pursue study in the College of Lib-
eral Arts and perhaps receive a
degree from that school.

Students now registered in the
College, who heretofore, have been
permitted to remain in the College

while preparing themselves for
certification to teach, will be re-
quired to apply for admission to
the School of Education on exact-
ly the same basis as will those
registered in the pre-education cur-
riculum.

According to Acting Dean L. P.
Sieg, the plan of deferred admis-
sion to the School of Education is
not aimed to decrease the number
of teachers, but to make possible
better teachers.

“It is the desire of the faculty

and administrative officers of the
School of Education of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh,” said Dr. Sieg,
“to turn out as a teacher an indi-
vidual who is not only well pre-
pared, but who also has those qual-
ities of personality and character
that should go into the making of
a good teacher.”
“If all of the students,” contin-
ued the Dean, “who are admitted
to the pre-education curriculum in
the College attain the standards
set up for admission to the School
of Education, they will be admit-
ted. Our goal is better preparation,
not elimination. Every student has
a right to a certain type of in-
struction; our desire is to try to
determine the place into which a
student will fit best.”

The present curriculum will be
revised so that the professional
education courses may be given in
the School of Education during the
last two years. In addition to pur-
suing the necessary courses in ed-
ucation, students will continue
study in the academic subjects to
round out the requirements of a
sound program. _

Only one professional education
course will be scheduled for stu-
dents in the pre-education curricu-
lum. This will come during the
second semester of the sophomore
year and will be in the nature of
a demonstration or try-out course.
It is planned to register students
in small sections and give them an
opportunity to show before the
group their ability in, organization
and presentation of material; to
demonstrate their “teaching per-
sonality." and to show their voice,
mannerisms, and other characteris-
tics as they address the class.
With the exception of this try-out
course, the first two years of study
will be entirely of an academic
character.

The same number of hours will
be required for graduation as un-
der the former plan.

20 Vaudeville

Acts, Awards

Feature Varsity Show Tonite

 

More than twenty “red-hot” acts
including several of the mystery
variety, will be featured in the
Varsity Night program to be held
in the Taylor Allderdice High
school auditorium at 8 o'clock this
evening.

The show, which is being held in
conjunction with the spring festi-
val program, is the annual Pitt
stunt night, at which the prizes
are awarded for the sweepstakes,
track meet, and floats.

As an attraction to the fraterni-
ties, a large placque will be award-
ed to the one best represented ‘in
attendance. And strange as it may
seem, the committee has formulat-
ed a plan whereby it claims an ac-
curate count may be made.

The program, as tentatively ar-
ranged, will be opened by the Town
Tattlers orchestra playing a med-
ley of popular songs. Emeric For-
michella, Italian character come-
dian, will follow with a skit in
native dialect. Vaughan Shelton,
youthful ubiquitous artist, will ex-
hibit thé intricacies of rapid-fire
cartooning.

Hog Callers Demonstrate

Those athletic Sioux City hog-
callers, Melvin Brown and Francis
Seigel, who received so much pub-
licity last fall, and even demon-
strated their ability over the radio
will give the audience an authen-
tic presentation of the lure that
makes them so successful out in
the far western barnyards.

Sumner Irey. who sp-ends his
spare time coaxing sweet melodies
from a musical saw, will present
his specialty and Leon and Co.,
billed as tumblers, will cavort in
a manner said to rival circus at-
tractions.

As a change from the vaudeville
variety of the program, boxing will
occupy the next spot. Joe Orsini,
boxing coach, has arranged a little
pugilistic act, but has kept its plot
strictly to himself.

Two musicians, Myron Shuler
and Meyer Solomon will work out
on their favorite instruments, the
piano and piano-accordion, respec-

- tively,—we hope. They will be fol-

lowed by William Pillich, who
demonstrated his tap-dancing abili-
ty so ably in the recent Cap and
Gown show.

An act which promises to be ex-
tremely humorous is the take-off
on Romeo and Juliet to be render-

ed (and torn asunder) as long as

Story Over WWSW

As a novel change from the ra-
dio programs which have charact-
erized the Pitt Panther hour dur-
ing the last winter, a continued
short story is now being present-
ed.

The plot revolves around two
college roommates and their life
on the campus. A bet devised by
the one to force the other to re-
capture his interest in femininity

serves as aibasis for comic situ-
ations, and love interest, of course

creeps into the story. It always
does!

Entitled “Between Classes at
Pitt," the program is being pre-
sented over station WWSW every
Wednesday evening at 7:15 o'clock.
As an added attraction next week,
Charles Beck, Ed. '32, Hiram How,-
ard, Col. '32, and Sunny Weslager
Ed. '33, will present one of their
skits so well received at past um-
versity events.

Members participating in the

INVESIIGAIE PROBLEMS
ﬂF IIIIIIII INIEHFEHENBE

The whirls and crashes that
often come over the loud
speaker while the favorite
crooner is before the micro-
phone are the despair of many
radio listeners, and a big prob-
lem to the radio industry.
Three seniors in the depart-
ment of electrical engineering
are investigating and using
this problem as a basis for
their thesis required for gradu-
ation in that department.

Robert E. Kurtz, Elmer A.
Drabik, and Harold Evans
have been conducting tests at

 

the Allis-Chalmers Manufac-
turing Company for the past
three months to determine

whether or not transformer
bushings are sources of radio
interfere-nce.

By testing new bushings the
investigators hope to discover
if the fault is inherent and if
so to ﬁnd and apply corrective
measures. Results of the tests
have indicated that the bush-
ings, when new, are practical-
ly free of interference when
used at voltages up to twice
the rated voltage, but produce
interference beyond that point.

Student Loan’ s Tag Day

 

Student Loan’s annual tag day

fund this committee of W. S. G. A.
raises each year to lend to needy
students.

Although the proceeds are con-
siderably lower than those of re-
cent years, Anne Kuhar, Bus. Ad.
’32, chairman of Student Loan,
said that donations were made
quite willingly.

Approximately forty-five girls
were stationed at prominent loca-

A One of the little things which help humor collegiate sports editors

‘and make them realize that after all they may have been right in sub-

slighted in one way or another by said journalist or by the athletic ad-

’ , ministration.

May 3, 1932.
A Dear Campus Scout: -,
In your recent column on the sport page of the Pitt Weekly
you expressed, tactfully perhaps, the view that equal awards for
. lettermen in all types of sports at the University should be
‘adopted. You used too much tact in the opinion of a majority

 of the members of the 1931 cross-country team.

What they wanted you to say was that the team has re-
ceived some downright, unfair treatment throughout the year.
The Iettermen have accepted their lot of annually being award-
ed a puny four-inch felt for five or six tough grinds against the
best teams in the country. But certainly, they are being walked
on when the athletic administration makes a change in the
minor award just in time to deprive the cross-country lettermen
from getting the improved insignia.

This form of protest may accomplish very little. Still the
sports columns of the Weekly have some weight. Athletic au-
thorities certainly read them. Our only hope is that they will

' feel some pangs of conscience and if the injustice is not righted
this year, some equal treatment may be accorded to next fall's
 team.

” r - Yours protesting-ly,
ANTHONY MAZZEI.

Nothing pleased us more this week than the receipt of the above
It has been a long, long time since anyone has referred to us in
terms" of affections approaching those of Mr. Mazzei; and while we

» would have been more pleased if the signature at the end had been that
" of a Kappa, we nevertheless pour forth mutual love and affection for
', the young man.

We also wish to thank Mr. Mazzei for the use of the word “tact.”
In times past, we have felt that that was one requisite which we lacked,
as an angry coach poured forth words of wisdom, knowledge and advice
to a young man who was trying to get along and at the same time help
others. All this was behind closed doors with the boys down at the
'Week1y oﬂice moaning at the prospect of chipping in a dime apiece for
ﬂowers.

At these times I have felt that I was treated unfairly and that life
would be more pleasant for a sports writer if there were no coaches and
no athletic teams. And at other times, I have felt the same way with
regards to the athletic administration, but those things have passed and
the boys usuall greet me with a hand when they see me. The hand
may be small, ut a hand’s a hand.

Seriously speaking, however, we see no reason for students
-trying out for an athletic team if the reward which is theirs at
the conclusion of the season is unjust. The justification of a
major letter or a minor letter is a debatable question, and both
sides can argue fluently on the matter. ’
Why have a-cross-country team at the University? Fifteen
is the highest number of candidates who have ever reported for
C the sport; and after the. initial time trials and the first meet,
.,m‘uy" the seven first-string m-en remain for practice. Students

take no interest in the sport, and no one is along the course or
' _ at the starting point to encourage the runners. -
_ Other sports at the University attract at least ten interest-
' : _ed spectators to a duel, but not cross-country. At some schools
A in the. country, cross-country is a major sport, crowds attend
, the matches and a cross-country letterman is a ﬁgure of note _on
.. the campus.

i ‘We have always believed that cross-country runners were a little
batty. for devoting the time and energy necessary for the maintenance
of -the physical condition required of participants considering the re-
ward which they have received. Most of the runners consider it their
duty to try again for the team once they have made it, and they
continue to participate in the sport although they do not enjoy it and
do not receive what they consider just laurels.

A ' Mr. Mazzei, however, errs when he insinuates that the athletic de-
partment made the change in the type of minor award just in time to
deprive the cross-countrymen of receiving the improved insignia. The
athletic department sirnply changed the type of award a short time be-
forethe Sports‘ Dinner, and the cross-countrymen were unfortunate in
that theirs was the only minor sport which was not to receive the new
letter this year.

At present, _we feel that cross-country requires more of its partici-
pants than does any other sport. Football players who dallied with
boxing this year assure me that the latter is the tougher of the two

sports, and the cross-countrymen who participated in boxing have dared

the boxers to report for cross-country. None of the other sports at the
-University demand more than do these, and we are willing to accept the
word of the athletes in this matter.

If this is true, the hill-and-dalers should be more highly honored

' than they are at present, ‘Our advice to them would be to drop the

sport; and as stated in this column last week, we would suggest the
awarding of similar letters and sweaters to all eligible athletes in the
University. -

l-[Faces Grove
City Today

Meets Bethany Squad ,.
Tomorrow; Plays
Tech Monday

With a season record of three
victories and no defeats the Pitt
tennis team will strive hard to
maintain this record during the

next week. Three matches are
scheduled in four days.
Today the~ racqueteers from

Grove City land on the stadium
courts to swap swings with Cap-
tain Ed Alcorn and his mates. The
Grovers have the reputation of
turning out better than average
teams but are _not expected to be
quite strong enough to take the
Blue and Gold.
Tell Us Another

Tomorrow the team plays their
second match of the season with
the racquet wielders from Bethany
College. Pitt blanked Bethany 9 to
0 a week ago today and should re-
peat their victory with ease. We
are inviting Bob Sage, manager of
the swingers to call at the office
and explain his activities while at
Bethany. You know how stories do
float around. ,

Monday, the tennis team will be
at home for the Plaid of Carnegie
Tech. Tech is quite strong this
year and has won their first two
matches with case. They took Du-
quesne over by an 8 to 0 tune.
This would indicate that Pitt and
Tech are almost evenly balanced
for the Pitt-Duke score was 9 to 0
in favor of the Blue and Gold.

Tech will be represented by
Grove, Harding, Norris, Gesling,
Jalonack, Corshenhausen and Har-
tig.

The Panther lineup of Jacobs
O’Loughlin, Ganger, Captain Al-
corn, Goodman and Wald remain-s
unchanged.

The unusual strength of the ten-
nis team is brought out more clear-
ly by the fact that it has not lost
a single set his season. Tweny-sev-
en encounters without a loss of a
set is quite a record in any town.

Last week the Panthers played
only one match in which they
whitewashed Bethany by another
score of 9 to 0. The match with
Wash-Jeff was. cancelled because
of the rain and will be played May
14 on the stadium courts.

Face Penn State Frosh In
Initial Meet

The Pitt freshman track team

will open its season tomorrow with
a dual meet with the Penn State
frosh at State College. The meet
will be held in conjunction with
the varsity Pitt-Penn State dual
meet.
The Panther cubs shape as an
unusually-un-balanced squad. They
possess greatpower in the sprints,
having a.t least five men who are
above the average. The weights are
but little, if at all, weaker. The dis-
tance runners are rather strong.
The hurdlers and the jumpers are
very weak.

'Menaker, Jacobson and ~S'chloss-
berg will probably run the 100 and
220 yard dashes tomorrow. Menak-
er, who is being touted as a future
great among the country’s sprint-
ers, is but little speedier than the
other two. Eberts and Fleming are
also qualified and are very capa-
ble.

The 440 yard dash will be han-
dled by Kiger and McDonald who
cover the distance in around fifty-
one or fifty-two seconds and are
improving continually.

Kirkpatrick is the best bet in
the half mile, while Wagenhouser
is favored to make the best show-
ing for the Panthers in the mile.
Allbright is satisfactory in the
mile.

The weights will be handled by
a group of pleasing track stars.
Gongloff is outstanding in the shot
put and the javelin. Smith, Seiffert
Fisher, Wilkins, and Bonavita
should take points.

The jumps and the hurdles will
be handled by a group of inexperi-
enced trackmen who are making
what amounts to their first try at

 

in his honor at the University club. the events.

Trackmen Assemble ‘F or
Silver Anniversary Meet

By HY COHEN

All’s quiet on the Stadium front.
That is, all’s quiet now, but when
more than 1,500 athletes of all sizes
and shapes assemble at the Stadi-
um tomorrow for the twenty-ﬁfth
annual Pitt Interscholastic Track
a.nd Field Meet, the ground keeper’s
nightmare will have materialized.
Of course, head ground’ keeper
Frank Mecca, was not asked for a
statement, but his reply ’ to one
would likely have been "I like you,
so scram now.”

The ground keepers are not the
only onces who have completed
weeks of worry. Frank Carver and

of the meet, have removed large
quantities ofwhat the barber makes

tion).

(Ohio), and Akron Central. New
Castle and ‘Warren tied for the
championship last year, and Akron
Central, with only two entrants, ﬁn-
ished a half point behind.

As usual, the class of entrants in
the 100 yard dash are the cream of
the crop. Nearly 100 entries have
been received for this event, one
entrant for each yard. It is likely
that with such a ﬁeld, of runners,
the meet record of 10 seconds may
be either, or eyther, tied or broken.
Six men have been seeded for this
race.

Several classy relay teams have
been entered from Mannington (W.
Va.) and Linsley Institute (Wheel-
ing). Both of these schools passed
up an opportunity to enter the

Three, K. O.’s Feature
Frosh Intramural
Boxing Meet

 

By JOE ORISINI,
Pitt Boxing Coach.

Surprises and thrills, including
three knockouts, marked the
cr-owning of eight boxing cha'm-
pions in the Freshman Intramural
Bloxling championships held ‘at
Trees Gym, Tuesday afternoon.

The survivors of the first round
found the going a little harder in
the semi-ﬁnals with most of.the
favorites coming through in grea
style. . V

The ﬁrst real surprise came in
the 125-pound class when Louis
Leon, former Y. M. ‘H. A. boxer,
gave Dick Zaiden a neat boxing
lesson. The clever Leon had things
his own way throughout th-e: en-
tire bout.

Little Joe

In the 115-pound class it took
little Joe Pace, the North Side
pride, four rounds to beat the will-
ing and likely Fabian ‘Mihelic for
the bantamweight title. Tnese- boys
stood toe to toe, and in the end of
three rounds the officials decided on
the extra round. Pace had a slight
shade in this round to take it and
the title-.

Billy Ame-s, freshman ‘basket-
baller from the upper Monongahela
Valley, pulled another surprise
when he gave Bernie Spiegel a
beating in three rounds. Spiegel
could not stop Ames’ left hand
which kept Bernie at long range
most of the time.

Lanky William fzhwimzner, who
really earned whd-$5 he got, had to
dispose of four opponents in order
to reach the ﬁnals. In the ﬁnal
bout of the 1215-pound class, Bill de-
feated Mike Michaelson, a very
good prospect, to carry away the
championship.

“Whitey” Wilson, basketball star
of the freshman team this year,
was not so fortunate as his pal Hil-

ly Ames. Anthony Homfeck de-
feated “Whitey” in three good
rounds.

Grand Old Pete

The real thrill of the afternoon
was given by Pete Visat, who fea-
tured the festivities at the Gym by
scoring a technical K. 0. over the
hard hitting Nile Faust in the ﬁrst
round after an exchange of blows
that looked like a windmill going
at top speed. Pete also scored an-
other K. 0. Victory in the semi-
ﬁnal when he dispos ad of lhe hard

hitting Bob Dempler in the first
round.-
In the ﬁnal for the 175-pound

title, Pete again proved his super-
iority when after two minutes and
ﬁfteen second of ﬁghting, the ref-
eree stopped the bout with Emile
Bonivita to save Emile from fur-
ther punishment. Pete cut Emile‘s
eye in the. last round, and Referee
Siegel stopped the bout. ‘
Ed Thompson Triumphs

In the ﬁnal for the heavyweight
title, Ed Thompson, freshman foot-
baller, gave the highly touted Mor-

are predicting victories, but so did¢

the Campus Scout when he-was
young at the game.
The different vehicles will make

vals because of the number of dan-
gers and -possibilities of injuries in-
volved. The time of each will be
taken, and the team ﬁnishing in
the fastest time. gets the ﬁrst place
cup. The team ﬁnishing second
will also receive a cup.
Route Described 1
The boys will race along Bayard
street toward the Tri Delt house,
but will keep on going even after
reaching that historic landmark.
At Belleﬁeld avenue, they will
make a left turn, racing along to

The tournament was under th

direction of Morris Cohen and Har-

Athletic Director, donated the
medals tha were awarded to the
winners a losers of the ﬁnal
bouts.

The results of the semiﬁnals and ﬁnals

Tomorrow

 

Panthers Journey To
State for Lion's
Initial Meet

The Pitt varsity track team
leaves tonight for State College
where they will meet Penn State in
a dual meet.

This will be the Lion’s first dual
meet of the season but part of the
squad took part in the Penn Re-
lays last Friday and Saturday and
showed up quite well. Their med-
ley relay won its event in compar-
atively good time. ‘

, The Lions are favored to beat
the Panthers tomorrow. They have
done so since 1921, nine times in
succession. 1919 was the last year
in which the locals were able to
beat their traditional rivals. Last
year Penn State defeated Pitt de-
cisively, 81-54.

Nine Lettermen Back

There are nine members of last
year’s varsity squad‘ back on the
team, and several excellent pros-
pects from last year's frosh squad
have come up.

The Lion sprinters will be Dale,
Van Curran and Nebel in the 100
and 220: yard dashes. and Gritsav-
age, Baird, and Rhodes in the 440.
Dale and Van Curran each ran a
220 and Gritsa.vage ran the 440 on
the victorious medley relay in the
Penn Relays.

he Panther sprinters will be
Harris Milligan, and Vitulla in the
shorter dashes, and Keller, Mon-
helm and DiMarchi in the quarter.
, There is a plethora of half milers
on the Lion squad with Dunaway,
Rishel, Hughes, Siesky, Baird, and
Space all available. Dunaway is
considered the best of these. He
ran a beautiful half to help the
medley relay win last week at
the Penn Relays. Watkins and
Tapp will face the pick of this
group. «
Glassburn Local Boy

Glassburn, King, England, Gren-
ninger and Van Cise are looked to
as point winners for the Lions in
the mile and two mile runs. Glass-
burn is the Penn State.cross-coun-
try team captain and is a former
Pittsburgh interscholastic mile
champion, hailing from Peabody.
Roy, Clise and Thiele will pound
out the mile for Pitt and Smoyer
Mazzei and Gaines will do the two
mile. , ,

The Penn State coach will de-
pend on Hill, Jackson and Byers

Strong High Jumpers.

Hammond, O’Shea, and Stray-
land should form a strong Penn
State combination in high jumping
while the broad jumpers are very
weak. Greenleaf, Kershner, and
May are likely pole vaulters. Mc-
Connell and O’dell will pole vault,
and Sebastian, Stirling and Kirk-
patrick, will jump.

Six Panthers journeyed to Phila-
delphia. last Friday to participate
in,.the-"Penn Relays, but the Pitt
boys uffered evil luck and came
back" ith less than they had when
they ‘started. “Woody” Harris,
sterling sprinter, who has been

.running in great form lately, was

robbed. While out on the ﬁeld in
a track suit, his street suit of
clothes, his watch and other valu-
ables were stolen.

The relay team itself fared bad-
ly, taking only a fourth in the class
“B” mile relay event. Valenti and
MacMurdo who were there to shot
put failed to place.

ROTC Review
Slated Soon

Army Oﬂicial At Drills
Held May 19-20

 

Both the Coast Artillery and
Medical units, which comprise the
Pitt ROTC, will be reviewed in the
annual inspection by a member of

the War Department, which oc-
curs this year May 19 and 20.

Major Hollis LeRoy Muller, in-
structor of the Organized Coast
Artillery Reserves in this district
will be the official representative
of the War Department at the re-
view. He was one of the first
United ‘States aviators to see- serv-
ice in the past war, and is well
qualified to judge the efficiency of
school units.

Class room inspection has been
set tentatively for Thursday, while
the inspection of equipment and ad-
ministration will be held Friday
morning. A review of the corps
will occur Friday afternoon in Rus-
kin field, and such dr_ills as Major
Muller-may call for will be demon-
strated.

Plans for the football clinic,
which will start at 9 o’clock to-
morrow morning, have virtually
been completed, and a novel meth-
od of teaching both the fundament-
als and different plays has been
evolved. At the start of the clinic,
the guards, centers, tackles, ends,
and backs will be in different cor-
ners of the practice ﬁeld, and the

' different coaches and players can

watch whatever portion of the
game that interests them most. A
member ‘of the coaching staff will
be in charge of each group.

when the players have become lim-

bered up, two full teams will be
pitted (another good word) against

should work without loss of life,

Fresh Tennis Team
Meets California Normal

With a record of one victory and
one tie, the Pitt freshman tennis
team seems headed for a wonder-
ful record, as the teams met to
date are better than those remain-
ing on the schedule.

Last Saturday, the fresh tennis
team held the Kiski Prep team to
a 3-3 tie. Kiski is rated as having
one of the strong prep tennis
teams in the East, and the Pitt
boys did well in holding such a
team to a tie.

During the next three days, the
fresh racqueteers will have their
hands full with California Normal
and Carnegie Tech plebes. --

California Normal will be met
tomorrow afternoon, and are not
expected to funish much opposi-
tion for the frosh.

The opposition that will be pro-
vided through the courtesy of the

Athletic Department of Tech willl.

be of an entirely different nature,
but those who have money to bet
are saying that the Panthers will
add the Tech boys to their victim
list.

Faust, Slocum, and Robbins seem
to be the best fresh bets, ranking
1, 2, 3, respectively. Close behind,
and close enough to displace the
ﬁrst three men are Goldenson,
Greene, and Lashine.

The indivdual scores

Singles.

Chemistry Faculty Give 3
Luncheon for Students

At the meeting election of offi-
cers for the coming year will be
held. The enterta.inment will be
provided by the faculty. Dr. ‘Carl
J. Engelder and Dr E. V. -Hjort are
members of the faculty committee.

The luncheon was formerly giv-
en for chemistry special students
only, but this year an invitation
was extended to the chemistry

Golfers Vie
With Kiski

Hand Panthers
Initial Setback

 

Lions

 

Pitt golfers face very stiff ‘OD:
position when they meet Kiski
over the Highland course Monday.
Kiski has not been defeated this
year, and is rated as one Of 1116
strongest scholastic teams in the
East.

The famous Jimmy "Marks, Jr..
will be in the lineup when the two
teams clash Monday. Marks, a real
star, won the National Interscho-
lastic cro_wn last year. A very
bright future is in store for him
if the opinion of golf experts can
be considered authentic.

He will be supported by Captain
Mercer, George Gates and Foster
Meyer. Meyer, a Bellevue boy, is
already quite familiar with the
VVest View course.

Pitt will lineup with the two
Wolff brothers, Decker and either
Bernachy or Byran as its repre-
sentatives.

The golfers were handed a 6 to 0
shellacking by Freddie Brand and
his Penn State mates on the State
course last Saturday. Brand and
Regis Wolff staged. a thrilling
match with the Nittany lad win-
ning one up.

Three Stars To Receive

The prospects for next year’s_

Pitt rifle team are excellent. It
would seem that a team losing
such men as Backen, Wuertenberg-
er and Wilsoii by graduation would
be in bad shape, Wilson was the
high scorer for the past year, Back-
en was consistent in every meet,
and Wuertenberger was the only
man on the squad to qualify in
every meet.

Yet, it seems likely that their

places will be capab-ly filled. Those
who are most likely to get in each
meet are Captain-elect Mair, Tans-
sig, Zoller, Franz, and Manager Car-
lin. With an array such as this it
would seem that next year's team
will be as strong as the present ag-
gregation. Besides these men, a
number of sophomores are likely to
break into the picture. ‘

During the past year the sl-
tions and timing of the w ole
squad have been considerably im-
proved, and at least six men will
enter next Year's competition with
some valuable experience behind
them. Besides these men who will
make up the team there will be
Lieutenant Wilson and Sergeant
Gunter, two very capable coaches
back for another year at Pitt.

The schedule for next year has
not yet been completed, but it will
be composed of the best teams in
the country. After the regular
schedule is completed the team
will again go to the regional cham-
pionships, and there are high hopes
of a far better showing than that

made this year.

Suleepstakes Fail to , 
Charm Sports Writer(?) 

 

By Special Permission of the Copy-
right Owner.)

The idea of holding an interfra-
ternity sweepstakes originated way
back in the dawn of prehistoric,
neolithic days. The idea started
from the habit of having rows and
rows of steaks lying on the pantry
shelf. As these steaks could not
well be eaten at the same time, al-
thought it was frequently tried, the
gold-brickers of thefamily were
set to work sweeping oﬁ the steaks
that had been lying around for a
week or two. L

Many problems arose out of the
custom of “sweeping the steaks.”
For one thing, the sweeper some-
times found himself confronted
with chops, and the method used
for steaks could not be used. To
solve this difficulty, the copywright
owners permitted the consumers to
change the name to “Sweepstakes.”
The addition of the word fraternity
came about by the regular methods
used by frats to bring their name
into everything. That is, hard and
conscientious work, with no favori-
tism allowed.

Sweepstakes

The interfraternity sweepstakes
that will be run off this afternoon
is a leaf from the parent tree in
many respects. A large and gen-
erous loving cup is awarded to the
frat ﬁnishing ahead ‘of the ﬁeld.
However, many discrepancies have
begun to make their presence felt,
and when the starter stutters “GO”
this afternoon, the contestants and
their vehicular contrivancs will not
be anything like those that primi-
tive man used. The only thing re-
maining, in fact, are the primitive
men. '

The entrants in the race will
seem queer to the average, that is,
unenlightened, student. Each fra-
ternity enters one driver and four
pushers, in addition to the mechan-
ical device that moves whenever
suﬁicient pressure is applied. The
difference in the intelligence of the

Fight! Fight! Fight!

The moronic, imbecilic, members,
Who usually comprise the brawn of
the house, are taken quietly aside

and ﬁlled up with a strange concoc-"

tion known as “Pep Talk.” After
an hour or two with a glib speak-
er, plus liquid
(water), the benighted ‘ individual
“volunteers” to push for the cats
of the MU MU house.

The course over which the race is
run is comparatively easy and sim-
ple, and can be done in ridiculously
fast time by any champion mara-
thon runner. In my youth I spent
many a week making the trip. That
in itself should prove how easy it
is. The fact that the pushers work
in relays makes the-task so simple
that, after the race, many of 
pushers wish that they had had
enough will ‘power to withstand all
arguments and allow the glory to
go to brothers Burp, Zoop, Gleep,

and Wzxyrtac, who spent the after-

noon cheering them on, (and rid-
ing around in front with four beau-
tiful dolls).
Who Said Water

The course covers twenty-three
miles of level stretches, four miles
of 45 degree hills, one mile of riv-
er, twelve water hazards, and thirty-
yards of quicksand. Several hard
hazards are being injected this
year to make the race interesting
for the spectator, and even with the
added inducement of the presence
of a bevy of glorious, talented, beau-
tiful, magnificent, extraordinarily
gay girls from the local Temple of
Burlesque. I would not advise any-.
one to waste an afternoon watching
brawn attempt to triumph over
brawn. It’s poor taste, and besides,
it’s not interesting enough. "

  A   Personal Appearance

OBERT L. RIPLEY, who has won something more than
-a little fame as a newspaper cartoonist’, made a “per-

V sonal appearance" at Memorial Hall this week, and “Be-
lieve-It-or-Not,” delivered himself of one of the shortest as-

sembly speeches on record.

In accomplishing that unusual feat‘, Mr. Ripley nobly
succeeded in disappointing one of the largest audiences ever
to attend a Universityassembly.

Celebrities, as one assumes Mr. Ripley to be, are natur-
ally granted certain privileges that are denied the average
individual. But among those privileges, there is to be found
no right for the famous one to impose on the good nature of

a public that has helped him to success.

Mr. Ripley ’s “per-

sonal appearance” was all too. much like the movie siren

who condescends to honor

her audience by slithering

across the stage-attired in a satin gown.
Certainly, Sigma Delta Chi, the organization that ar-

ranged the assembly, had been given to understand that Mr.

Ripley would present a program of adequate length.

Mr. Ripley has been made to assume the brunt of the
criticism. Perhaps,’ he was helpless about the matter, since
his newspaper sponsor seemed intent in displaying him in

‘ as many parts of the city as a half day’s time would permit.

Baby Eloise arrived at the U. of

the girls’ dormitory when Baby El-

the scene. All the girls climbed up
on tables and chairs ‘when Baby

Gaucher College Head
Addresses Hungry Club

 

Dr. David A. Robertson, presi-
dent of the Goucher College in
Baltimore, addressed a mee-ting of
the Hungry Club last Monday in
the English room of the Fort Pitt
Hotel on the subject of “Personnel
Methods and the Presidency.” Dr.
David R. Craig, director of the Re-
search Bureau of Retail Training
presided at the meeting.

Dr. Robertson spoke on the pos-

sibility of applying -modern person-
nel methods to the evaluation of
candidates for any given public of-
ﬁce.

Dr. Robertson listed duties re-
quired of the president, asserting
that if we are to have good presi-
dents we must choose the man
who has the qualities and the abil-
ities for carrying out executive du-
ties.

Dr. Craig, however, believes that
this method is not likely to gain
acceptance because of the extra-
ordinary difficulty involved where
the routine of operation is so com-
plex and because of the national
habit of accepting politics due
largely to environmental condi-
tlons.

Pi Tau Phi, honorary scho-

for the first time as a frater-
nity limited to students in the
College.

Heretofore students in the
schools ‘of Business Adminis-
tration, Education and the
College, were considered as
possible tappees. In schools
other than the College, how-
ever, little interest was evinced
in ‘the organization, because of
school honorary. fraternities!
such- as Beta Gamma Sigma
and Kappa Phi Kappa. For
this reason the fraternity voted
at its last meeting to add to

Last Sunday was a beautiful day. Bird songs, sun-
shine, buzzing ﬂies, and all that sort of thing. The
first day of summer, glorious and jocund.

“Let’s have a picnic,” coaxed my Holden, “just you

and me.” No sooner said than done. Humming love
songs and clapping several odd “Pease porridge hot;
pease porridge cold.” I was ready in a. jiffy.

Out of the clothes press came the summer ﬂannels
and into the picnic basket went the olives, potato
salad and minced ham sandwiches. With a nickel
bottle of ginger beer. “How lovely,” cooed my love-
bird, “we'll find a ittsle blttsie grove, just you and
me, and we’ll have a ittie bittsie picnic.”

O O C C O 0

I'm not much for picnics, ever since the time I lost
the.th-ree-legged race at the Baptist Sunday School
outing. But this was different. The wind tousled
my curly locks as we whizzed along the highway in
my speedster. I was thrilled! So thrilled, in fact,
that speed meant nothing to me. I tramped the
accelerator to the ﬂoor. We were hitting a fair 22
miles per hour, and I took it as calmly as if it were
nothing. “Whoopee,” I screamed. My girl cautioned
me with a wave of her littieﬂnger. She knows my
enthusiasm has no bounds. Once, it was she who
saved me from ruin when she stopped my dissipa-
tion. There I was stomping through the May Drug
Company, my mind blurred with the effects of six
lemon phosphates, recklessly throwing away my
money in the penny weighing machine. ‘She it was
who rescued me from disgrace.

We were alone in the grove. “Isn't the ittie bittsie
picnic lovely?" queried my lady. “Glad ya. like it,”
I curtsied modestly.

_ The white cloth spread over the grass, fastened at
the corners with bottles of mustard and salt shakers,
and my little dove laid out the picnic delicacies. In
the bottom of the basket I found a pink paper hat.
The old life of the party instinct, and in a swish I
had it on my head and prettied about the grass,
skipping, kicking my heels, and singing "Hail To
Pitt." Then Idld’ my thimble trick. How :my dar-
ling laughed! Good old Weslager, ever spreading
sunshine. Suddenly a weird noise rumbled from be-

  .,'sum issue-an   

hind an oak tree. A pair of horns appeared. A

lowered head. Beating hoofs. I didn't stop to think.

Zip! I was oﬂ. '

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a tornado of
paper plates, torn linen, and cardboard spoons. Po-

tato salad fell on my shoulders like hall. The dam

bull had wrecked our dinner. I stopped atlast,
breathing heavily. Suddenly'I remembered my lady
love.
1, whose uncle had been known as Polite Harry Wes-
lager; I, whose grandfather was the Gallant Gus of
McKees Rocks. Here stood one whose veins surged
with Weslager blood refusing to assist a lady. Fie!
Fie! For shame!

Determined on rescue whatever my own penalty.
I wheeled about. Over the grass I ran. Through the
bushes. My face bled against the burred twigs.

In the clearing I saw my lady love. What was she
doing beside that wild animal? Why it seemed
tame! It was standing still! She had her hands on
the animal! Suddenly she turned. “Look," she
said, “I have something lttle bittsie for you to drink."
It was a bucket of milk! “Ha, ha," I said, "I fooled
you.
wanted, to scare you. But, ha, ha, I knew allalong
it was a. cow!" All with remarkable presence of
mind! “

avoided by other cigarettes?

EVER since Lucky Strike created
that special process for purify-
ing ﬁne tobacco and told the full
facts about cigarette smoking-—
tbe industry has been in an uproar.
For Lucky Strike has dared to
mention things that were con-
sidered “taboo" in the cigarette

You may have noticed a striking
avoidance generally of the word
"inhale” in cigarette advertising.
Why? Goodness only knows!
For everybody inhales—knowingly
or unknowingly! Every smoker
breathes in some part of the smoke
he or she draws out of a. cigarette.
