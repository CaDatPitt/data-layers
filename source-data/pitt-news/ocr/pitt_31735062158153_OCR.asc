In his recommendation for the
acceptance of NAACP, Fred Whit-
tier, Arts ’61, reported _to the
group the ﬁndings 61 COROSO.
He related, among other things,
the functions and .purposes ‘of
NACP as a group on campus.

Some of its functions would be
“to promote informal and formal
discussions; to .. bring in outside
speakers; and to promote minor-
ity groupsaof all kinds.”

Its purpose, he reported,
would _be to “educate"students
with, regard to the problems of.
minority groups and’ discuss
these problems in an intelligent
manner in order 'that a reason-
able solution may be found.” . ,

Betty_ Lou Burleigh, president
of the University chapter of NA
ACP, when questioned, suggested
that NAACP could handle such
situations as" the‘ “class segrega-
tion in the Tuck Shop.” ‘

-Woody Turner, Arts ’61,_ stated
that it would be a “dangerous
precedent forthis school to rec-
ognize pressure groups.” He
then said that, “if the group on

on the Recognition of Student Organiza-

tions will investigate.The Pitt News tomorrow. Fred Whittier.

WCOROSO chairman, said that this probe will be conducted at

an open hearing in the English Nationality Room, 144 cl, be-

A ginning at 4 p.m. ' ~ “ --
- This investigation has been ordered, Whittier revealed,

as a result of several ,chargesO

ties for the /upcoming student
elections.

By “yellow-dog editing tactics,"
Whittier explained that certain
people, whom he declined to iden-
tify, claim that the editors of the
News rewrite stories “to their
liking and give the stories a dif-
ferent connotation” than they
originally have ‘

“I’ll name speciﬁc examples at
the hearing,” Whittier said.

Concerning the second charge,
_not giving “equal space,” Whit-
tier related that a few of the
members of the Allied Collegiate
party, whichxhas received no re-

mittee, “thought they should
have had equal space in the is-

. sues-of the News, especially Mon-

day’s."
‘Millard Amdur, editor of the
"News, reported that the paper is

of its editorial decisions. He
further said, “The accusations
made by Whittier are unfounded

else his political bias.

“ ‘Yellow—d o g’ journalism is
certainly_ a misnomer as applied

row and to squelch prompetly the

. unjustified committee action.”

Whittier did not state deﬁnitely
what .' he expects to accomplish
from the investigation. “It prob-
ably won’t be to de-recognize the

policies,” he concluded. , u

The Allied Collegiate Party, yet
to be ‘recognized by the elections
committee, has been accused of
containing “dishonest" elements
in its ranks. . ‘ _ ‘

John Gooding, Pitt Action Par-
ty campaign manager, made ‘this
charge yesterday when he was
asked whether he thought the AC
group should be granted recog-
nition for» , the student elections
two weeks from today, March 18.

.Dr. Peter B. Hammond, a mem-

ber of the University faculty who

‘the Hillel Foundation, the New-

‘ Foundation are not pressure‘

groups in the same sense as that
of NAACP working towards a

D speciﬁc goal.

"‘We are not

Dr. Hugh Cleland of the His-
tory Department, commented,
“The real question here is a
question of freedom. If a group
of. students want an organization
andfeel that it will beneﬁt the
students and not -be detrimental
to the University, then there
shouldn't be any'question of ad-
mitting it." - .
The old. motion to dissolve
Men’s Council was brought up
again, this time in Denis Licht-
ma.n’s presence. A ‘
Lichtman, who is president of
MC, stated that he felt that Men’s
Council. “can function with the
continued backing of Dr. Donald
Swarts and SGA." The motion,
which was amended to provide
for the dissolution of “the present
structure” of MC, was carried.
Turner then presented a "mo-
tion to the body- to “direct the
Elections Sub-committee of the
Personnel Committee to over-'
see the election of a ﬁve-man
board which shall perform any
and all ‘duties which were pre-
viously ‘under the jurisdiction of
Men’s Council.” . 
This organization will have to
report on its activities in Dec.,
1959 at which time SGA “will
decide the worth of this board
and determine the need for main-
taining it.” The motion was ap-
proved.

The Pitt News editorial board is to be questioned to-
morrow afternoon  COROSO‘in[regard, to its editorial

policy. ; y  _
They are being questioned as a result of more than any-

thing else a political squabble, involving the chairman of A

the COROSO Committee, Fred Whittier, . S , 5
Whittier is also a candidate for president of Student

Government Association’ on the unrecognized’ Allied Colle-

giate Slate. \ ‘

Whittier’s coupling the issue of the “investigation” with
the fact that this newspaper has not published the AC slate
or given “equal space” to this party is an example of mal-
feasance in office. ' _ «

It—is the use of political position for political gain to a
far greater extent than Tammany Hall ever carried it.

This newspaper has nothing against Whittier, the in-
dividual, or the Allied Collegiate Party. In a recent dispute
on pre—registration, The Pitt News supported a Whittier
stand. - ‘e - ‘ C V

The fact remains that the Allied Collegiates are not
recognized by the only body authorized to recognize them.
No precedent _exists for recogni_t_ion_,temporarilyor_ tenta-
tively or anything of the sort. Asa matter of fact,'once the

-slate were published, it would matter little whetherpthe

partywere recognized or not. .

Jack. Hardman, adviser to the.Student Election Com-
mittee, did not overstep his bounds in his granting the AC
Party the right to organize. He never granted’ temporary
recognition to the party as Whittier asserted.

When Whittier wasquestioned concerning the legality

of what he thought was temporary recognition by Hardman,

he‘ quickly answered, “Well, .-it doesn’t matter. For if this is

"not legal, then Ray King will ‘grant4the party temporary

recognition as adviser to COROSO,"’ the group of which

‘Whittier is chairman. ‘ .

This obvious‘ misuse of power which threatens to sub-

jugate the free press onithis campus "cannot and will not be ,

allowed. There is no reason for this paper to‘,-publish the
slate until authorized bythe proper student group.

The presidential aspirant was careful to mention’ that
this was not the only charge against the newspaper, It was

i~ accused of “yel_low—dog” journalism which evidently means
-_,.yellow tabloid journalism. This ‘charge is completely uri-«
—founded. A

Whittier seemed quite surprised that editors occasion-
ally change emphasis in news stories to make the most note-
worthy portion of the story stand out better. This has been
done for many years ‘in all free newspapers in the world.
And this newspaper will continue to do so. 

The results of the star chamber proceedings tomorrow" I

will be duly reported, that is, if we are allowed to continue
to publish. ’

To‘ Meet the;Cha||enge .
By David Breaksfone . .

It has. become fashionable in smart circles to
p_onder ways -and means of. meeting the “Russian
challenge.” In the haste to-formulate a quick cure
for the situation, ‘too many pseudo—sages have for-
gotten to ‘' ﬁgure out exactly what the “challenge”
is and just how it is challenging us.

One of the American institutions under scrutiny
and reappraisal naturally is "' ‘
higher education. “There must
be something wrongfwith ‘our
system if the iron masters of
Communism can turn out 50%
more technical servants ‘ .”
goes the current tune, accom-
panied by harmonica and guitar.
The education experts and pro-

medicine men have
been jumping. into __the _news-

-papers with astonishing regularity," for the past A

year, with plans for everything from crash pro-
grams tomandatory calculus for, all eighth graders.

‘Today, no journal of critical thought is complete

“without its contribution to the category of “What’s
Wrong with Your Schools?” -01‘ “The Little Red
Schoolhouse -Revisited.” ‘T . ’ ’
To_o Few Action Programs ’ -
Undoubtedly, and seriously, there is much to be
accomplished in the form of improvement in edu-
cation in contemporary America. Too. few thought-
ful analyses and programs for action have been
forthcoming, of late, which makes the prospects
for actual improvement dim and uncertain. Into
this depressing picture .Henry Steele Commager
marohed two weeks ago and brightened up the
landscape with vigor, perception, and eloquence.
Commager came. to the University as the lec-
turer for the Pitcairn-Crabbe - Series, that local

I "‘only-chi1d”- of the endowed lecture family which -

has beenso fecund at other seats ofhigher learn-
ing. His topic for presentation was “Quantity and-

.Quality, in American Higher Educ_atio_n.” a topic

which he had first explored for the New York
Times in early 1958. i

With business like dispatch the Amherst his-
torian stated that the American college is the
product of inheritance, experience,‘ and environ-
ment, and a unique product at that. He traced the
roots’ of higher education in Europe and England,
"particularly at Cambridge and Oxford, two ‘stops
on his own scholarly wanderings. A I

Commager whipped from his introduction to the
citation of four problems which face the American
college of today and.of thepfuture: theexpected
growth of- --universities, the responsibility of the

Unrest in Community ’

  

   ‘   I 
university to the community, the growiingicost of
education, and the inevitable urbanization of the

university. -
In ,the‘ﬁ_rst area, he called for “less emphasis

on teaching and more on ,learning.” With the in-

crease of students and the probable same inade-
quate number of teachers, college students will
have to ,take». more individual responsibility for
their own education. Commager. denied that the
best colleges are those which have the most favor-
able ration.of students to teachers. “What are the
libraries for?” he asked. “Does every bit of infor-
mation have to come from lecturers’ mouths to

be returned at a later date?” Let the students do ’

more readi-ng and writing, and less listening and
memorization, he urged.

Reduce Fi§ca| Waste

With larger universities “marginal. benefits”
should not be indulged in. Ridiculously, all-inclu-
sive athletic ppograms which bear no relation to
intellectual development and -catch-all extra cur-
ricular activities should be curbed; The reduction
of ﬁscal waste should be accomplished with speed.
Further, he stated that the intellectual atmosphere
of universities needs speedy improvement in order
tokencourage academic freedom and healthy self-
criticism. ‘‘

With bulldog tenacity the small, white—haired

easterner criticized the subserviancy of many uni-N

versities to the local community and to the busi-
'ness world at large. The university must search for
truth ‘and eternal -values, and shun the transitory,
immediate needs which these two institutions rep-
resent. Above all, the university’s responsibility is
to promote and preserve freedom of/thought and
action for all its members.’

Increase Federal Aid

A In the area of ﬁnancing, Commager called for
increased Federal aid as the only road to salva-
tioi1._He discounted_ conservatives’ claims of politi-
cal interference and dictation of policy and sub-

’ ject matter. “Learning is always private,” he said,

“despite_:the source of revenue.”

Finally, he predicted that all great universities
would become urbanized in the U. S., and he stated
that the English “pastoral college” was fading_
quickly: He urged higher education to prepare to
meet this prospect with wise planning and de-
velopment. In this regard, he "praised the ﬁne ex-
ample set by our University.

Commager raced to a dramatic conclusion by

observing that the standard of excellence must be

preserved despite the exte\r_'nal changes in educa-
‘tion, and that only under such a standard could
we’ meet that elusive “Russian challenge.” ~

The Treatm’e'ntof’  Lumer-

‘ moralized by a

By Ina Amdur

Recently Dr.-_ Hyman. Lumer, '
Secretary of the‘

Educational
American Communist Party,
was invited to speak at Pitt by
the YMCA. This invitation caus-
ed much unrest ‘ i
on the part of
many a d u 1 t s
w h o w e r e
afraid that the
P i t t students“
were being de-

subversive. The
papers received
m a n y c o m-
plaints such as
the one in The
Pittsburgh ~ .

Press which described the “in-

trinsic evil of atheistic commu-.

nism.”

Dr. Lumer-mdid come to speak’ '

and an overwhelming audience

of over five hundred students.

attended. People vwere standing
in order .to see this strange in-
dividual. In fact, the whole at-
mosphere was redolent of a cir-
cus freak show.’ ‘ -

Dr. Lumer‘ spoke in an pn-
emotional, but sincere manner.
He was not‘ propagandizing for
his cause, nor was he deriding
the capitalisticsystem. If any-
thing -he was too unemotional,
and seemed frightened. ,But Dr.
Lumer had the courage to speak
for a cause which he believed

in, even though it was a very ,‘
- C “ ‘ duping the question period were

 

should be respected ifnot ad-

mired.‘ However" the Pitt stu-
dents showed quite .the opposite
reaction when the question per-
iod came. The questions for the
niost part « were deliberately
phrased and stated to bate the
speaker.

condescending Tones

The questioners spoke in con-
descending tones, and they did
little to hide their antagonism.
Some of the’ questions were too

~ involved for Dr. Lumer to an-

swer in the short period that
was allotted. Others were ques-
tions with very obvious answers
which shouldn’t have been ask-
ed at all. After the question of
one student there was a loud
burst of applause. '

In short, the whole meeting
was a disgraceful ‘example of
disrespect._Dr. Lumer spoke and

no ‘one listened.‘ They had their

preconceived ideas about Com-
munism and they weren’t going
to listen to someone who had
different ideas. After all, he was
only a Communist,’ anyway.
Ifa University -is supposed to
be a place of freeinquiry and
intellectual ~attairiment,i this as-
sembly did not manifest these
purposes. It showed that the
adults in Pittsburgh who spoke
against having a Communist

speak ‘were afraid of free in-

..quiry. / . -

Mob Emotion A
‘The students. "who clapped

disp1aying_gthe' danger I of mob

to speak at the University; he
did not ask to come here. Any

speaker who comes‘ to this Uni- r

versity or any university de-

serves the respect of his audi-
ence.

If he does not receive this re-
spect, then the courses "at the
University have not fulfilled
their purpose. This attitude of
complacency "and. unwillingness
to listen to anyone who differs
with us is‘a dangerous symp-
tom of insecurity displayed all
over the United States.

I do not condone the atrocities
of the Communist regime. They
are pitiful examples of man’s
inhumanity to man. However
the treatment which Dr. Lumer
received at this University was
not exactly an evidence of hu-
manism either. T

We at the University -should
arise f I om our ‘intellectual
apathy and mental -stagnation.

_ The YMCA is to-, be.praised for

bringing the Communist speaker
to Pitt. Dr. Lumer is to be prais-

ed for coming." We are not to

be praised for treating him as
we did. .

“Hennon won't make All-Am

AY cnass , ‘
erican this year._” This lament was

heard numerous times in local basketball circles as the past season
wore on. At first only a handful of doubters expressed this view. But
as the basketball year came nearer to a close, the opinion spread. It
reached its apex when Hennon scored only eight points against Navy
a couple of weeks ago. There wasn’t a chance. ‘

But the ‘Pitt hoop season is

over now and the All-American

selection season has begun./Hennon won't make it this year? How

‘ wrong could anyone be! Thus far two dream teams--the Sport-

ing News and United Press International—have been selected and

h is Don Hennon.

As far as anyone who has seen Hennon play the pastlthree years
is concerned, there’s isn’t anywhere else you could place this 5-81,1;

native of Wampum, Pa. _
When Hennon ﬁrst tried the
the varsity, Dec..5, 1956, he was

that home opener against Westminster, Donnie couldn’t do a thing for

32_ minutes. He" wound up only s
But in the next two years, tw

ix points. .
0' months_ and 23 days, the amazing

All-American did everything it was possible to do on the Fieldllouse
ﬂoor. His performance last Saturday night against Penn State merely
put a coat of the shiniest lacquer on his career. Dr. H. C. Carlson,

who had watched a multitude of b
termed that performance “the best

asketball players in his many years,
I ever saw a college boy’ put on.”

Dr. Carlson didn’t stop there with his— praise of Hennon. “No
one, including ‘Bob Cousy—whom I coached in the East-West
game-—-could pass or dribble as well as Hennon. Even as a senior
Cousy didn’t do any more things than Hennon.”

Who was the better Pitt player, Hennon or Charlie Hyatt, who

also was a two-year All-American

-in the 1930’s‘? “They were different

type players,” Doc replied."‘Hyatt was taller, more agile. He could
dribble past one or two men, but not three men as well as Hennon.
_ “Hyatt all-round would have a shade over Donnie, but he

couldn’t do as many individual
Don in individual skills.”

No one could surpass Don in

ute remaining Saturday night C

things as well. No one surpassed

modesty either. With about a min-
oach Bob Timmons readied Billy

Mauro toreplace Hennon. The script called for Timmons to pull
Hennon with a few seconds remaining so he could receive the tre-

"mendous ovation due him.

But Don pulled an ad lib on
Timmons by calling time when he
got the ball. In doing this, the
Wampum wonder walked to the
bench with the rest of his team-
mates and not by himself. ‘He
didn’t quite take his seat on "the
bench unnoticed, though.

Hennon had a different ex-
planation for his calling time.
“Billy Mauro wanted to come
in. Coach had him on the side-
lines waiting.” It makes little

7. difference w h i c h explanation ‘

you accept. Either. one makes
the future graduate of Pitt med-
ical school tops as an individ-
ual.

Hennon leaves behind him a

_ string of Pitt records which will

probably stand for a long time to
come, maybe forever:

Points in one game—-45; points
in one season--651; points in ca-
reer—1,841; ﬁeld goals in one
game—-20; ﬁeld goals in one sea-
son—267; ﬁeld goals in career-—
723; successful foul shots in ca-
reer—-395. His average for 76
games was 24.2 points.

When it was over, Hennon said,
“I hate to see it come to an end.
I enjoyed my four years at the
University of Pittsburgh.” Need-

Bubh Injured;

It took until the ﬁnal dual meet
of the season, but the injury bug
ﬁnally caught up with» Rex Peery’s
matmen. Bob Bubb, Panther cap-
tain, suffered a knee injury with
only A a minute ‘ .
remaining in his

Penn State’s
Sam Minor last
Saturday night.

making a quick
turn. That in- Bubb 7
jury cost Bubb ,a perfect record
as he had been undefeated and
tied" once in nine matches.

It is questionable whether the
Panther senior will be ready for
the Eastern championships on
March 13 and 14. Peery feels
that having Bubb in the line-up
is a necessity if the Panthers"
hope to win the team title.

‘-‘With Bubb  there, we will be
one of the top contenders,” the
coach‘ said. The Panthers ﬁnished
the dual Vmeet season with a 9-1
record, the only loss coming at
the hands of Lehigh.
