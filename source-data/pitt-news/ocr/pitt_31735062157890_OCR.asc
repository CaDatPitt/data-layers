Our Challenge

The revelation in Tuesday’s News that the paper next

,year would employ a home-operated vari-type process of type

setting was doubtless received by a majority of_the readers
as so much newspaper double talk. They don’t particularly
care how it is done, just so it’s done.

But the switch to vari-type was aAdecision which, before it
was made, was weighed as carefully by publications ofﬁcials as
the Allied command the Normandy invasion plans. The move
gives publications staﬁs the task of justifying it. Only if the
challenge is met successfully, will future changes in the direc-
tion of making publicatons true and complete student enter-
priseslikely be fully considered by University officials.

A complete setup for doing the complete job of publish-

ing a newspaper, from the gathering of the news to the rolling
of the presses, is at least two years off. Whether it comes
then depends on what is done next year by the News staff.
A We have this to shoot for. The enthusiasm of Publications
Advisor Lohmeyer is our driving force. Installation of vari-
type is his baby. If it is reared properly, he_envisions it grow-
ing into a full-scale daily paper, much like the one he ob-
served in operation this, wcekA—-thevYale Daily ,News.

While “vari-type” is just a new word for some reader’s
vocabularies, it is the ﬁrst word in a sentence denoting pro-
gress in student publications at Pitt.

For Graduation Ceremonies

An estimated 9000 people will be present at commencement serv-
ices, at 10 a.m., June 8, on Cathedral lawn. This ﬁgure includes 2,421
graduates, the largest class ever to graduate from the University.

Glenn S. Peacock, department of buildings and grounds predicted
that the seats will overﬂow onto ODK walk, the lower walk, and the
steps of Heinz Chapel.

Graduation will be held in that section of the lawn bordered by
the two walks, Heinz Chapel, and the University. I-

A speakers’ platform will be constructed on the terrace by the
University, the site where the flag stands. Two ramps leading from the

platform to the audience will be for the graduates to walk to the"

$platform when they receive their
diplomas and to leave the plat-
form.

Mr. Peacock also believes that
the company which rents the
chairs to the University will have
to bring in additional chairs from

otherccities to meet the Univer-
sity’s large request.

This year’s class exceeds the
class of ’48 by 900 students. Pres-
ent enrollment ﬁgures indicate
that the class will set an all time
high, University omcials believe.

The services will include a
speaker who will be introduced by

’It’s the spirit of service that makes telephone people think

It’s a devotion to duty that no thing and no one-can

It’s loyalty to a cause that is greater than those who teach
it, those who learn it, those who feel it, and those- who
stand by it.

For telephone people, from ﬂedglings to old timers, know
what telephone service is and. what it means and what
it must continue to be.

They know that aisingle telephone call can be the dif-
ference between life and death, joy and son ow, success
and failure, "victory and defeat. ‘

They know that nothing must stop telephone calls from

Nothing!

Thiscled him to oculists, and he
recited two of his jingles about
middle age, “Peek-A-Boo, I Al-

Nash’s conclusion was:
“Today I would be, if I

One thing that worries Nash is
the lack of a« younger generation

only conclusion is that radio and

A ccaant for Baseball Team 's Slump

By LYNN MITCHELL

The experts and observers still tagging along with Ralph
Mitterling’s baseball club are biting their ﬁngernails in an ef-
fort to account for the recent losses by the Mittmen. After
a brilliant start which saw the Panthers win-their ﬁrst ﬁve
games, the Mittmenkhave dropped six out of the last ten.

Mittmeh-To Play
At Vets Hospital

Panther baseballers will make

their customary visit tomorrow to
the Veterans hospital in Aspinwall
for a game with Western Reserve,

men.

Ever since the war Ralph Mit-

-terling and his boys havetried to
(make at least one visit to the hos-
pital each season. The game was
originally scheduled‘ to ‘be with ,
Allegheny but because of the post-
ponement with Reserve in April
the Allegheny game was switched
to Schenley Oval.‘
‘ The patients at the hospital an-
ticipate the game‘ and go all out
to have the ﬁeld in ﬁne playing
condition. Early last April the,vet-
erans received quite a treat when
the Detroit Tigers worked out on‘
the ﬁeld prior to an exhibition
game with the Pirates.

Only two games remain on the
Mittmen scheduleafter tomorrow’s
affair and both are with ‘the West.
Virginia Mountaineers in the only
doubleheader of the seasonrto be
played on May 28 at Morgantown.

The Mounties’own a ﬁve-game
streak ov,_er the Panthers. They A
whipped Pitt, in the last three -
games in .1948; and twice at Schen-
ley Oval in April this year.

Tennis Win/Over Penn State

Will Put Experts to Shame

By DAVE POLLOCK

Tri-State tennis supremacy will
be at stake tomorrow when the
Panthers meet Penn State at State
College.-

Certain esteemed writers on the
downtown papers have already
given the mythical title to Du-
quesne. But as far as Pitt is con-
cerned, it was a little premature.

The Nittany Lions have only
won three matches in eight starts.
All of their matches have been
against top-notch competition,
though, and one of their triumphs
was a thumping 8-1 decision over
Duquesne.

So if the Panthers can whip
State on Saturday, they will have
a valid claim to the best net team
in the district. And the reporters
ll- the Golden Triangle can draw
up a new form’ chart.

If the Panthers are to win to-
morrow, they must play the best

tennis they are capable of play-
ing Coach Sherman Fogg has six
lettermen back from last year’s
squad which handed Pitt an 8-1
lacing.

" YEAR'S HIGHLIGHTS —

1   1948-4 9 Sports Season Sees
Pitt Scaling Success l'(l,lIlIeI.'-1

. By WILL DOERGE
A banner period for sports at Pitt was 1948-49.
Just a look at the record bears out the fact that the year was

 big time look

the best in a long time.

One thing in the Panthers’ favor
is that they are entering the
match in the right frame of mind.

Dr. Dave O’LOug_hlin’s 'netters
want to win this match in the
worst way. This is the big match,
and they’ve looked forward to it
all week. S

Though all the men have been
playing good tennis, John L0hstoe-
ter and Stan Weil are still the big
guns in the Pitt attack.

In individual play, both of them
have lost only one match.‘ And in
doubles play they are still un-
beaten. A

On Wednesday, the Panthers

blasted Carnegie Tech, 8-1, for
their ninth .win on ten starts, and
their eighth victory in a row.

Pitt used nine men in handing
the Tartans their fourth loss in
six starts.

Panther Social

The Panther Club will hold
a social meeting in the social-
room of the Stephen Foster Me-
morial on Monday at 7:30 p. m.
In addition to movies there will
be a." sports forum and refresh-
ments served.

Successful seasons‘ in football and basketball were capped respec-
tively by the 7-0 surprise victory over Penn State,‘and the 34-32
overtime triumph over the Mountaineers of West Virginia, ending

their 57-game winning skein at.

The Panthers’s six and three

record in football was nothing to
be sneezed at. Pitt stepped into
the national spotlight with their
surprising victories over Indiana,
Purdue, and Penn State.

. Nick Bolkovac will long be re-,

membered for his great play and

his touchdown jaunt with an in-
tercepted pass against. State. Bol-
kovac, by the ‘way, was Pitt’s ﬁrst
All-American selection since pre-
war days. ‘

Nor will Jimmy Joe Robinson’s
miraculous catch of Bimbo Cec-
coni’s pass that won the Indiana
game be forgotten. Coach Mike

_ Milligan was signally honored
that week when he was picked
"Coach of the Week.”

Trackmen End
Short Season  
At Miami, Ohio

Panther cindermen travel to
Ohio again tomorrow for the sec-
ond time _in two weeks and for
another tough meet with Miami
University of,Ohio.

This is the last meet of the out-
door season for Carl Olson’s soph-
omore’ squad, and the outcome
will mean the difference between
success or failure. .

The season thus far has been
a surprise to many for the Gold
and Blue have won three dual
meets as against one defeat, that
by Notre Dame last month. After
downing Western Reserve in the
opener, the Olsonmen, despite nu-
merous injuries, have beaten
Wayne and then Ohio University
last week. . '

Team Play N

All victories this year have
come as a result of excellent team
play, with no outstanding Aper-
formers doing all the work. A
good illustration of this is how
the local crew ganged up on
Wayne, a favorite by along shot.

Every runner Olson could mus-
ter appeared in the .meet, "and as
a result, numbers paid off with-
out any stars being needed. The

margin of victory was only by,

four points; but the second and
third places reallycounted for a
plain team win.
Miami Loaded

It could easily be _a different
story tomorrow, because as Olson
points out, “the ‘Miamians are
usually loaded, and they edged us
last year 75 to 58.” He also stated
that ‘the host team will have
strength where Pitt‘ has it, in ﬁeld
"events. . ' ,

Plans Dinner

If Webster Hall has ordered an
unusually large amount of food
for next week, the answer is the
Pitt Singers’ banquet. ’

Publicized all year as the group
“that would rather sing than eat”
because rehearsals were held
lunch hour, the Pitt Singers have
decided to make up for lost time
at their banquet slated for 6:30
Tuesday, May 24. 4

Besides eating, the banquet will
be climaxed by the presentation
of keys to Singers who have par-

ticipated actively for two years.
