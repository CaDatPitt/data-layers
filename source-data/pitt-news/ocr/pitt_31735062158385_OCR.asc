To Take Place
On Wednesday 1

Today marks the opening of
this year’s Pitt Chest Week.
The Pitt Chest is the single
annual charity drive to which
the University students con-
tribute. These funds are dis-
tributed to ﬁve agencies.

Solicitations envelopes were
distributed in the classrooms on
Nov. 12 by volunteer student
workers. . ’

The solicitation envelopes may
be turned in to the student volun-

teer workers ‘in the 10 a.m. class
this Wednesday.

Envelopes may also be turned
in at the Student Desk anytime
on Wednesday. Envelopes will
be given in class on Wednesday
to those who have forgotten
them. Pledges may be made, but
those making pledges should
fulﬁll them as soon as possible
at the Student Desk.

The first charity, Save the Chil-
dren Federation, will receive $120
for adoption of a child by the
University.

World University Service, the
has been‘ allo-
cated 50 per cent of funds. WUS
is the international service for
needy university students through-
out the world.

The United Fund of Alle-
gheny County, the third organi-
zation, will receive 25 per cent
of funds. This is the same
amount they received ‘last year.

CARE, the fourth agency, will
continue to receive last year's

students in inter-racial colleges in
this country.

Commenting on the purpose of
creating the Pitt Chest Advisory
Council who selected these ﬁve ‘
charities, General Chairman

money is going.”

The Bicentennial Committee - of

' SGA was recently formed to co-.

ordinate student activities begin-
ning with the Pitt—Penn State foot-
ball game Thanksgiving Day,

— which olﬁcially kicks off the city-

wide schedule of events lasting
through the next calendar year.

The committee, advised by Rob-.

department, and headed by Roger

'Panella is composed of leaders of
,.the principal student organiza-
tions, which will participate in the '

student bicentennial celebration.
Coinciding with the events in
the city is a full calendar of ac-
tivities for Pitt students which
will have a bicentennial ﬂavor.
Besides the social events, it is
anticipated that the honorary
academic fraternities will join
the celebration with programs
that will be scholarly represen-
tations of the contributions that

A their .various disciplines have

made to the university. and the
city in the history of this area.

Similarly, it is hoped that many
of the unusually scheduled social

sume‘ a form relative to the bicen-
tennial theme.

The committee will meet with
the chairman and faculty adviser
tomorrow, at 3:30 p.m. in room 320

Fairy Tale Comes Alive
As Huskers .Win, 14:-6_

. By LARRY HAGGERTY .

Last Tuesday at the weekly Panther football luncheon
at Gustine’s, Coach John Miche1osen,. just as he does every
week, cried “wolf” for the upcoming encounter with Nebras-

ka. But none of the so called experts present would believe

him. .

That’s how it happened in the well—known fairy tale, and
that's the way it happened to _the¢
Panthers Saturday at Lin c oln
when they were upset by an up-
start Nebraska eleven, 14-6." As in
the case’ of the little boy and his
sheep, no one came to the rescue
of the Panthers, who supposedly
were facing the one breather on
their schedule.

All they had to do was beat the
Cornhuskers by two or three
touchdowns and they could then
name what bowl they would play

Athletic Director Tom Hamil-
ton thought that all the publicity .
‘about a bowl bid had lulled the
team into a false sense of se-
curity. “We were sitting ducks
for the‘situatio_n,” he said. “The
trap was set and we fell into it.
It never should have happened.”
A gloomy Michelosen had this to
say after the team arrivedback in
Pittsburgh. “It was a disappoint-,
ing game, all right, in that I
thought the boys wanted to win.
They certainly didn’t play like it
though.”

Nebraska registered touch-
downs in the ﬁrst and third

. Neither the rain nor Ohio
U. - could stop the Panther
Booters Saturday as they
made it two wins in a row
with a .6-3 victory over the
men from Ohio, The six, goals
that the Panthers scored equals the
total number of points they scored
in eight previous games. _
The booters displayed ﬁne pass-
ing throughout the contest as they
repeatedly forced Ohio U. to take
the defensive. Their ﬁrst goal
came with 11:20 gone in the sec-
ond period when Bob Murdock set
up Fernando Fabragas who push-
ed the ball past the Bulldog goalie.
Murdock got his second assist
three ‘minutes later when he fed
the ball to Ed Giraldo who put
the Panthers ahead 2-0.
The third period opened with

the Panthers still knocking at

quarters to take a 14-0 lead into
the ﬁnal period and then with-
stood a frantic Panther attack
which saw the game end on a

with an assist from Chuck Kane.
Tom Young scored the ﬁrst of
his two goals with 10:20‘gone in
the same period and the Pan-
thers were ahead 4-0.

Now it was the Ohioans’ turn.

pushing, and the other came thirty

Bob McNulty and Young scored
the Panthers’ other two goals in
the ﬁnal period. The Bulldogs also
picked up a goal in the ﬁnal period
as Paul scored his third goal of
the game on another free kick.
This time it was Fabragas who
was caught holding after he had

ﬁrst touchdown for the boys from

The Cornhuskers required just
six plays to hit paydirt. A left-
handed pass from Right Halfback
Larry Naviaux to End Mike Eger
was good for ten yards and the
touchdown. Quarterback George
Harshman missed the conversion
attempt.

A 53-yard punt return by
Fullback Carroll Zaruba’ of a
Mike Ditka punt set up another a
scoring chance for Nebraska
near‘ the end of the second
stanza. This time, however, the
Panthers were equal to the task
and stopped the Cornhuskers at
the one.

Nebraska scored the second time
that they had the ball in the sec-
ond half. A‘ poor punt by Ditka,
his ﬁrst boot under 35 yards this
season, gave the Cornhuskers pos-

it was another left-handed toss
from Naviaux to Fischer for the
touchdown. This time the bold
Cornhuskers decided to try for
two points on the extra point try
and were successful as Fischer
ﬂipped to Naviaux.

The once bowl-bound Panthers
ﬁnally scored with about eight
minutes to play in the game when
Kaliden passed 35 yards to Dick
Haley in the end zone. The Jungle
Cats’ hand was forced to go for
two points on the conversion, but
they failed as a shovel pass from
Kaliden to Haley was stopped at
the one. . ~

Once again the Jungle Cats de-
pended on Kaliden to pull the
game out of the ﬁre and give the
Panthers at least a tie. The sec-
ond-string" senior did his part in
moving the ball from his own ten-
yard line to the Nebraska 14 as the
clock ran out for the losers. _
