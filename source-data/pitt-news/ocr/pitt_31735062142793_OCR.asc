duce conclusive findings for stu-

Veterans.Lose
Pass Battle
With Railways
“Giving veteransstreetcar pads-
es is discrimination,” stated Mr.
C. D.__Palmer, Commercial Man-

ager of Pittsburgh Railways, at
a meeting in Mayor Lawrence’s

office Friday morning between.

Railway oﬁicials and Pitt veteran
representatives.

The chairman of the Pitt com-
mittee, Larry‘ Gibson, explained
that the meeting with the Pitts-
burgh Railways was one in a
series of meetings to effect ac-
tion on‘ getting Pittsburgh vet-
erans attending institutions of
higher learning a streetcar pass.

_ City Officials With‘ Vets

Jack F., Watson, committee-
man, ‘and Tony McGrath, ‘the
groups’ attorney, completed the
Pitt unit which discussed the
problem designed to save the vet-
eran a portion of that slim $65 a
rnonth., _ » R M V _
. Miss Anne X. Alpern, City So-
licitor, and the Mayor’s secre-
tary, Mr. Robin, sided with the

veterans and oﬂfered suggestions

to both groups, but Mr. Thomas
Fitzge_rald,.P. R. trustee, and Mr.
Palmer maintained their stand in
that giving the veteran a pass
and denying a «civilian student
one is discrimination and is
against their policy ‘regarding
such matters. ' ‘
Previous Aféempts Failed
Previously, the Veterans ‘asso-
ciation had triedto get streetcar
passes for all students but -had
failed because of a provision by
the Railways. Itwas that no one
could get a pass who was not un-
der the compulsory attendance
regulations of the state, as public
school studentsare. 1 ' —
-Jack F. Watson explained that
the Veterans association will sub-
mit petitions, containing the sig-
rratures of 5,000 Pitt Vets, to the
Public Utilities commission in
Harrisburg in a ﬁnal attempt_to
get passes.

Crowds swarm the Commons room between classes; mobs
descend upon the Tuck shops at lunch time; elevators are al-
ways jammed; people are everywhere. That is Pitt, 1946.

It is difficult to “blaze a trail” through the halls, and dur-
ing lunchtime someone is always spilling your coffee or up-
setting your tray. But are these inconveiiiences reason enough

tomake Pitt students drop completely their age-old, courteous;

manners?

Pitt‘ men are still expected to remove their hats when
they walk through the Co-1rnmonsw~ro01n or ride in the eleva-
tors, regardless of the crowded condition. Pushing and shov-
ing will never be forgiven, no matter how slyly the act is
performed or under what trying conditions it takes place.

’l‘l1ere are times when a. student would be a “dead duck” if
he happened todrop something while in the Tuck shop. Some
students neither look nor care when a person is in difficulty.
They continue on "their own little way, forgetting the comfort
of another. ’

This way of acting, while an outgrowth of our present I

overcrowded situation, is not a natural part of Pitt. It'can be
overcome with a. little consideration from all. Take your time;
look before you walk over someone; do not let doors slam, in
the faces of oncoming students, remove your hats when in the
building, be considerate. Remember—we’re all in this together!

Sun Through City’ 3 Smog 

by Clifford Gerwin

Pittsburgh today is the ﬁeld for the internecine battle‘ between
the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial
Organization. At the moment the question is—who shall make the
3.2’? This is an ironic, situation indeed for this city was the smogy,
grimy birthplace of both these great labor unions.

Back in 1881 when Carnegie meant nothing to Illinois a group

of men led by ﬁery reformers, Sam Gompers and Adolph Strasser, .

of the Cigar-Makers union, cam.;$

to Pittsburgh to start a new chap-
ter in labor history.

It seemed to be ‘a rather piti-
ful challenge to the Knights of
Labor, an organization then on
the ascendancy. But Sam Gompers
was a Belgian immigrant imbued

‘ with the idealism of the European

labor movement of that time. He
was a short—legg,ed man with a
tremendous head and shoulders.
And from this tremendous head
he breathed the ﬁre of life into
America’s ﬁrst successful labor or-
ganization.

Out. of the embryonic Federation
of Organized Trades and Labor
Unions, which he founded, grew
the American Federation of Labor
whose estimated membership to-
day is more than seven million
men and women.

Just 57 years later another birth
cry was heard. Here too, the CIO
was born. Perhaps this genetic
process more closely resembled
Eve’s creation from Adams rib,
for these CIO men had been mem.
bers of the A F of L. They en-
visioned the organization of the
mass production industries, a
hitherto untapped reservoir of un-
skilled labor. But the A F of L

chieftans at ﬁrst did not want to

bring the common laborer into the
aristocratic fold ,
Once the unskilled men were

i signed up, however, a great quar-

rel arose concerning their distri-
bution among existing A F of L
craft unions. The insurgent Com-
mittee for Industrial Organization
rebelled against such

leadership. Though they were ex-

 

pelled from the A F of L actu-Q L

ally they had “quit before they
were ﬁred.”
The Grotto on the Northside was

the maternity ward that witnessed 

the birth of the Congress of In-
dustrial Organization, in 1938.
Here, Sidney Hillman’s Amalga-
mated‘ Clothing Workers, How-
ard’s Typographical union, the
United Mine Workers and ﬁve
other labor groups elected John L.
Lewis to head their new organi-
zation.

He, too, was a labor leader with
a‘ large head. But it was his ex-
pressive‘ eyebrows Vwhich were
destined to become the symbol of
labor power. Of course his tur-
bulent career has since led him
back to the A F of L camp, though
not before he had seen ﬁve mil-
lion [members ﬂock to the CIO
banner. . .

The labor “brothers” are fully
grown now—rough and ready. All
that a tired mother Pittsburgh
asks is that her two proletarian
oﬁspring choose another Valley in
which to make their Decisions.

the student-f0r—student
drive opened yesterday, canned
goods and clothing have been
coming to the ground floor booth
regularly. The YWCA, which is
sponsoring the drive, hopes to
have a large amount of material
to ship to Europe and Asia before
it ends Friday, Dec. 13.

According to Frans Gerrit Roes,

a graduate student in industrial
engineering f r o m Costerbeck,
Holland, “This drive is one of the
best means to pulld rrzendship be-
tween nations. It creates a friend-
ly feeling between the future
leaders of these countries by lend-
ing help where it ismost needed.”

Frans encourages Pitt students
to give any clothes whether they
are o1d—fashioned or not because
the students overseas are glad to
have something to wear.

It is suggested that studeqii-ts
donating either food Or clothing
include their names and addresses
to initiate letter writing with
other students all over the world.

Panther Fve Loses
Opener to Buckeyes

Pitt ’s “\Vin ’em all” campaign fell by the wayside Satur-
day night when Ohio State choked-off a last-half Panther rally
and went on to triumph, 39-33.

A clinic game crowd of 7,663 fans held out small hopes
for the Panthers when they trailed, 21-11 at the intermission.
But they roared back from the dressing room, dropped-in 12-

Mermen Drills

Practice has begun for the Pitt
swimming team.

Following a meeting last Thurs-
day afternoon at which 25 candi-
dates reported, drills began at the
Trees Gym pool.

Sessions have been called for
six days a week with Howard
Waite in the coaching role. Waite,
who is head trainer of the univer-
sity athletic teams, has had pre-
vious experience in coaching mer-
men. In his last stint at this
sport, the popular bone and mus-

cle specialist tutored a Navy
squad.
No schedule . has been an-

nounced as yet, but it is believed
that three to ﬁve district tank
teams will be met on a home-and-
home basis.

Swimming has been absent
from the Pitt campus since 1942
when Ben Grady mentored the
squad.

Although Sam David topped the

was the steady play and height of
Boose which the Panthers sorely
missed in the early portion of the
game. Dodo Canterna garnered
eight points on four ﬁeld goals.

State’s Lester Pugh topped both
teams with '12 points. In the sec-
ond half, slight Jimmy Harris
chipped in with three timely two-
pointers, revived the Buckeye of-'
fense, and State went on to notch
the six-point verdict.

It was a clean sweep for State.

In the preliminary, Scarlet and '

Gray reserves nudged the Pan-

now leads Pitt, eight games to
seven, in the 15 game series which

_began in 1925-26.
