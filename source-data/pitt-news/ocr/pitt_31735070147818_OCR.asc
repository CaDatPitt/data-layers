The sign ﬂashing at Atwood and »

Forbes on a Saturday night sig-

“naled “Don’t Walk.”

But the couple wentanyway,
roaring with laughter as they
clumsily avoided getting struck
by cars. The girl, one arm en-
twined with her partner’s and
the other pressed up against her
body, ﬂounced quickly. Her heels
clicked and clacked against the
pavement, her skirt bouncingjust
above her knee. Her partner’s tie
was loosened, ﬂapping as he tried
to keep pace with her.

It was a week before ﬁnals,
but they didn’t care. It’s only col—_

lege, right?

But when a student is passed
out in the middle of a party or
getting sick on a Port Authority
bus, it’s rarely just another col-
lege experience. It could be a sig
of alcoholism. ~

Anna Vitriol, a health educator
at Pitt’s Student Health Service,
said in an e—mail that about one in
three college students meets the

criteria for alcohol abuse.

She deﬁnes the disease using P

four criteria: craving, loss of con-
trol, physical dependence. and
growing tolerance. '

Drinking to the point at which

one has a strong need to drink,

loses control after drinking, ex-

» periences withdrawal symptoms

like nausea and shaking when not
drinking and eventually needs
more alcohol to feel its effects
could point to alcoholism. And
although only the alcoholics ex-
perience the symptoms, Vitriol
says the disease affects all on

campus, even those who don’t »

drink. —
According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention,
excessive’ drinking can have
long-term effects, including in-

' terference with regular growth,
memory problems and changes‘

in brain development.

Vitriol said that research indi- _

cates that brains continue to de-
velop into young adulthood, the
common age of college students.

.Drinking during this critical de-

velopmental period can lead to

impairment in brain function.
And though some are quick to

. shrug off the implications,,simply

attributing excessive drinking to
the college lifestyle, Vitriol said
-this kind of attitude can “lead
to drinking more than intended,
for longerlperiods of time, with
risk of greater negative conse-
quences.” a

With the ‘approach of Finals
Week —— and Pitt’s F*ck Finals
party tradition — the line be-
tween drinking to celebrate and
drinking to get drunk becomes
almost too easy to cross.

“The consequence of the
‘it’s only. college’ attitude leads
many college students tofeel

these methods of drinking exces-
sively. This is the type of extreme"
partying attitude that can lead
to drinking more alcohol than

intended, for longer periods of.

time, with an end result of severe
intoxication and/or alcohol poi-
soning that is more dangerous
than fun,” she said. a

Kent Poole, a 21-year-old se-
nior at Pitt, said he doesn’t drink,

but he could see how the attitude

of “it’s only college” could affect-_

his peers.

“People [in college] might
think it’s not real,” he said, re-
ferringto alcohol abuse.

He said he wasn’t surprised
that alcoholvproblems affect 18

to 29-year-olds more than any. _
C other age group, a statistic Vitriol .

mentioned.
‘For students who have
reached that level of dangerous

- behavior, the Counseling Center

offers services to combat alcohol

- problems. The center, located in

the William Pitt Union, has a full-
time clinician who is a drug and

_ p « alcohol specialist.
that there is nothing wrong with 9

James Cox, the director of
the Counseling Center, said in
an e-mail that the specialist will
evaluate students referred by
campus personnel and recom-
mend counseling or treatment
if necessary. ' .

Like‘Vitriol, Cox said one sign
of trouble is lack of control when
drinking. He also lists other signs‘

. that could indicate a drinking

problem.

‘It’s. only college’ attitude might hide drinking problems

“Some signs [are] poor [class]
attendance, possible poor aca-
demic performance, problems
at work or problems with,rela—
tionships with those who care.
Blackouts and trips to the ER as a
result of injury while drinking or
repeated legal problems can also
be sign of trouble,” he said.

While alcohol problems clear-
ly affect the person who’s drink-
ing, Vitriol said thateveryone is
affected by drinking. She calls
the phenomenon “second-hand
drinking.” ~ , _

She gave as an ‘example ,stu-

dents who suffer because their .

roommates’ drinking habits af-
fect the students’ studying and
sleeping schedules. . -

But she also listed more seri-
ous second—hand consequences
of drinking; A

“In 2009, nearly 696,000 col-'

lege students between the ages

. of 18 and 24 were assaulted by

another student who had been
drinking, and more than 97,000

' college students were victims of A

How to drink right

There’s a difference between
enjoying a few drinks and drink-
ing to oblivion. Drinking safely
doesn’t mean not drinking, and

; Vitriol lists a few tips to make

sure students use alcohol safely
and sensibly.

Keep track of how much you
drink. Whether you use beer
tabs, pen’ marks on your arms
or counting straws, be sure to
count to keep yourself safe.

Count and measure. Know
the standard drink sizes so you
can count your drinks accurately.
One drink equals one 12—ounce
bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass

of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof _

liquor. V

‘When you do drink, pace
yourself. Sip slowly. Have no
more_ than one drink per hour.

Eat food. Don’t drink on an
empty stomach.

Remember that there is noth-
ing wrong with saying no to a
drink. A true friend will respect
your decision.

Be a friend, know the signs,
call for help. Most importantly,
understand the importance of
being able to identify and act
appropriately in the case of an
alcohol emergency.

Know the signs

The signs of an alcohol emer-
gency are something every col-
lege student should be aware of
and understand. Keep in mind
that a friend could be having an
emergency even if they do not
show all of these signs.

To make sure you are being
safe, understand the signs of an
alcohol emergency:

-Heavy vomiting or vomiting
while passed out

7- Slow, shallow or irregular
breathing A

-— Unresponsiveness or inability
to communicate

— Violent or threatening de-
meanor

—— Cold, clammy or blue skin
—Loss of bodily control

-4 Inability to stand or walk

Call for help

Here’s the bottom line: If
you’re unsure about what to
do but think a friend needs as-
sistance, call for help. Alcohol
emergencies require immediate
medical attention. If help is not
called, there could be more seri-
ous consequences, like death.

Editor’s Note: For a longerversion of
this story visit pittnews.com

When it comes to bars, just like pizza
places or study spots, we all get to
know our favorites. But whether

you’re a recently turned 21-year- ‘

old or .you tend to stick to the same

places when going out for drinks,

here’s a bit of information on each of
Oakland’s bars that could make you

a better informed drinker.

We’ve kept this list to strictly bars
that are more about drinking than
eating — although some have good
food, too.

In attempt to stay hyper-local,
those who venture to the South Side
or other areas for their debauch-
ery won’t ﬁnd any of their favorites

- here. But Oakland’s bars each have

enough character, diversity and beer_
to satisfy any thirsty bar-goer who’s
lookingforabettertimethansitting
in his living room splittinga case
with his roommates.
Bootleggers

403 Semple St.
412-682-3060

Bootleggers offers a variety of

bar-related activities: chilling, danc- L

ing and pool. When the crowd’s had
afew drinks, the dance ﬂoor, though
relatively small, heats up. In the back
room,,the pool tables are rarely free,
so be prepared to wait a round or
two if you want to play.

Sunday nights are ladies’ nights A

where a pretty young thing like
yourself can get $1 domestics and
$1 well drinks. .

Hook-up Factor: Just off-center

from the Oakland bar scene, Boot- '

leggers has a diverse crowd of Pitt
students and those just out of college
that gives the place a good vibe and
plenty of choices. '

Garage Door

223 Atwood St.

,412—621-4842

On any warm spring or summer

A night in Oakland, the sound of the
crowd at Garage Door ﬂoats through '

t_l1e bar’s open—air windowsl Inside,
there’s often a nice breeze to go with
the 

_ For beer, Garage Door regularly
has a $2 20-oz Miller Lite special

V ' ‘and $5 pitchers of Bud Light. G-Door ,
_ has several large rooms but it still

gets crowded on any given Friday or
Saturday night. Head all the way to

the back and there are a couple pool
tables to add some activity while
drinking. There’s also an air hockey
table — the only air hockey table in
an Oakland bar.

Hook-up Factor: Make your way
to the back room where the pool
tables are and we can almost guar-
antee you’ll get a chance to stroke a
cue or two. Unfortunately, it might
belong to a law school student.

Gene’s Place _

3616 Louisa St.

412-682-2158

Gene’s bar might be small, but at
least we know he’s not compensat-
ing foranything. It can get crowded
quickly, but the service is quick and
personal. Don’t be surprised if Gene
remembers your ‘name.

The bar counter and smaller ta-

' bles throughout make Gene’s a good

place to hang out with afew friends.
The air can get a little smoky if you’re
a non—smoker, but Gene’s offers‘ a
varied selection of domestics and
imports if you like beer. The custom-
ers at Gene’s tend to be a little older
during the earlier hours. Then the
college crowd comes in and things
get crazier.

V Hook-up Factor: Gene’s has a more relaxed
atmosphere, but that means an opportunity for
some engaging conversation if your words are
better than your dance moves; Just try not to
pull off too many smooth lines, because a few
drinks can really hinder delivery. Since the bar
is smaller, the dartboard is rarely unattended.

Hemingway’s Cafe

3911 Forbes Ave.

412-621-4100 .

www.hemingWays-cafe.com

$5 Miller Lite pitchers are always a popular
choice at Hem’s, but if you want something
a little sweeter, order a Blackout or Cherry
Cheesecake shot pitcher. Some shot pitch-'
ers come with gummies or Dum Dum Pops.
Hemingway’s has a half—off menu from 11 to
11:45 a.m., 2 to 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. to midnight,
except on Sundays, when the bar is closed. The
burgers are a lot better than your average fast
food joint’s $5 special, and the wings are meaty
and never overcooked — good stuff for when
you’ve got the drunchies. '

Hook-up factor: Deep into the night, Hem-
ingway’s gets pretty full; So when you’re pass-
ing through the crowded aisles and you see
some hot thing heading your way, keep your
hands to yourself. But here’s your chance to
drop your best lines. ”

Avoid talking-aboutghow crowded it is,
the weather and how much beer you’ve had
spilled on you and maybe you’ll get a response.
Maybe you’ll get a number, or maybe you’ll
get a chance to spend another night alone in
yourbed with an old sock and a half-empty
tube of lube.

Logan’s Pub‘
- 301 North Craig St.

412'573‘8433

Logan’s is abit isolated from the usual cam-
pus bar scene, so it has abit of an older crowd.
But it is still a convenient bus ride away from
campus, either by Pitt shuttle or Port Authority
bus. The visitors are mostly in their 20s and
30s -—— with afew older patrons — and it’s gen-
erally quieter than bars like Pittsburgh Cafe or
Hemingway’s. Logan’s has game-day specials

and it’s the closest bar to upper campus.

Hook-up factor: Depending on the night,
there might be plenty of ﬁsh in the sea, or it
~ could be a goldﬁsh in a puddle.

Mi Ranchito
346 Atwood St.
412535-3240

they do have a good selection of domestics
2' and imports, as well as some tasty Mexican
food. Mi Ranchito won’t have the same kind
of crowd as more dance-heavy bars like Pitts-
burgh Cafe, but the inside is plenty lively with
open space that people use to talk, or dance
if they want. 4 '

Dart skills might not translate as well to being’
good in bed as say, dancing, but at least it’l1'

for many Pitt and professional sports games, ’

Those who don’t consider ﬂailing their
arms around on a bar stool dancing should

come to P— Cafe to really get their moves -—— and ,

sweat — on. P- Cafe’s lower floor has a standard
bar and several tables, but upstairs there’s a

by the swelling crowd. And don’t come here
if you want to catch up over a few drinks, or

at least stay away from the high— decibel dance .

complished through shouting and not niuch
else. - .
If your legs need abreak, there_’s yet another
ﬂoor above the dance ﬂoor that ‘has another

' barand a view of the dance floorbelow so you

can scope out the hotties. _

Hook up factor: You’re only as hip as your
dance moves, and if you’re a good dancer,_
chances are you’re conﬁdent, have great endur-
ance and aren’t afraid to try some new maneu-
vers —— both on the dance floor and where it
counts.Just remember, anyone can grind. Not
everyone can pull oif the shopping cart, dougie,
air guitar and other highly skilled grooves. But

if you can, you won’t go home solo.

~ Peter’s Pub ,
116 Oakland Ave.
412-681-7465
www.mypeterspub.com
The second ﬂoor of Peter’s Pub is another
hot spot for dancing. But with music blaring
throughout —there are DJs on both ﬂoors
—— the crowded spaces in between tables and
the bar often become their own little sites for
busting a move.. If you get bored of the music
downstairs, head upstairs for some different

‘ beats. They often have live bands or D]s up-
stairs, one of a few bars in Oakland that does _

this. Be sure to stop by on your 21st to claim
your horns. Keep ‘em on forgthe night and

you’ll receive more “happy birthdays!” than

your Facebook wall. ,
Hook-up Factor: Pete_r’s was so crowded

'to the bathroom. Your odds are good. ' '

Whatareyoulookingforinabeer?Just12 ounces -

ofbrown ﬁzzy water, or somethingalittle differ-
ent? This year, a number of innovations inbeer
distribution have served to answer the second
part of that question with specially designed
products. . P '
With thatin mind, we looked at three newer
technologies — the Newcastle DraughtKeg, the

Miller Lite Vortex Bottle and the Arnold Palmer .

32 oz. jug — to see if 'they’re really worth‘ your
weekend — and maybe weekday —— dollars.

Each of these options does something new and_

different, butwhether or not these innovations
are more than marketing  up to you.

ﬂavor and a particularly frothy head

Size: 5 Liters (about 14 12—ounce glasses)

Price: $20 at Save—Mor Beer & Pop Ware-
house, also available at Pitt’s -Doggin’ It on At-

Ohad Cadji I Assistant Photo Editor

Heineken International — which owns New-
castle — introduced the draught keg system
with its ﬂagship Heineken pilsner a few years
back and recently began doing the same with
the famed English brew. ‘ A

Newcastle Brown Ale is a deﬁning beer for
northeast England. It has long been popularl
in the United States for its ﬂavor,«which com-
bines the deeper malt notes of a dark beer with
a somewhat lighter ﬂavor than darker porters

like Guinness.

After an assembly which takes just a few
seconds, the rnini—keg begins to produce its
famed contents with ease. Perhaps the greatest
difference visually between the mini—keg and the
more readily available bottles is the thick head
the beer produces — it almost has a whipped
cream—like consistency.

The ﬂavoris rich and deep, without too much
carbonation, and only just falls short of the ex-
perience found in local watering holes.

For those who love Newcastle or draught
beer in general, this is a superior product when
you’re trying to bring the bar home-

THE MOUSTACHE CLUB OF. AMERICA

Beer: A human history

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

According to our Internet sources, one of-

the strangest and most mysterious pleasures

‘ in life is-beer. Little is known about this mi-

raculous elixir, however, so we decided to
conduct a hard-hitting investigation that’s
certain to get us shortlisted for a Pulitzer
Prize or perhaps even a MacArthur Genius
Grant. . ’
‘For starters, beer is a relatively recent
invention. The most credible story attri-
butes its creation to Jakob “Thejaker” Bier,
an early 20th-century Danish chemist who
sought a delicious accompaniment to the

5—krone frikadeller dinners on which he sub— ,

sisted during his college years. After ﬁddling

around with some chemical compounds, he 
stumbled upon a secret formula that was —
' later popularized in the United States under

the “Milwaukee’s Best” label.

Other scholars claim that beer origi— ~

nated further south on the continent. Ac-
cording to this legend, a‘ militaryofﬁcer
from Tours, France, who was engaged in a
primitive form of “Call of Duty” known as the
Franco-Prussian War‘(1870-1871), sought
a better way to relax with his bros. Unlike
moustache-waxingand sideburn—growing,

the era’s two ‘principal hobbies, the resulting V

“biere” — which he fashioned out of truffles
and tubers —— offered these French soldiers
an opportunity to unabashedly amuse one

another by makingfart sounds and quoting .

popular lines from one of playwright Henrik
Ibsen’s most recent hot college comedies.
Regardless of its provenance, beer cap-
tured the hearts and mesolimbic system
reward circuits of Americans during the

' 1950s. Prior to beer’s arrival on our shores,

nearly every single man, woman and child
in America smoked unﬁltered Pall Mall ciga-
rettes. Baseball players toddled to the plate
with two or sometimes even three cigarettes
dangling from their mouths.- Cars rolled
off Detroit assembly lines with cigarette
burns preinstalled in their upholsteries.
Elementary school students were given three
15-minute smoke breaks each day.
It wasn’t long, though, before beer had
seized the day and vanquished smoking from
every public facility in America. Owing to the
support of legendary alcoholics like home
run slugger Mickey Mantle, glamorous
pinup Farrah Fawcett and charismatic ca-
nine spokesdog Spuds McKenzie, millions of
Americans were soon rushing to their local
drugstores or 7-Elevens to acquire cases of
this exciting new substance. Whereas smok-
ing had merely reduced their anxiety, beer
introduced people to a thrilling, carefree
and unspeakably fun new world. I
The effects of beer consumption on the
nation were immediate and almost entirely
positive. For one thing, the American popu-
lation quintupled between 1950 and 2010, a

testament to beer’s ability to make anyone
and anything appear as attractive as Farrah
Fawcett. On top of that, the GDP grew at a
much more rapid rate as people redirected

their hard—earned savings‘ into creative and"

useful activities, such as paying off enormous
bar tabs and buying snazzy new clothes to
wear to the bar.

By 2010, there were four distinct beers ,

being sold on the American market: Miller
Lite, Budweiser, Bud Lite and Milwaukee’s
‘Best. Pedants might argue that there are
actually millions of microbrews on the mar-
ket, but much like how most “champagne”
is actually just, sparkling wine, these other
products are best classiﬁedéas “alcoholic_
drafts” and thus left outside the scope of
this report. 7 ,'

A distinct “beer culture” has grown up

around these four brands, one into which
most university students are indoctrinated
after they reach our society’s sacrosanct
and inviolable drinking age of 21. Without
access to a potent brewski, most adolescent

' pleasures are simply unendurable. Can you

imagine, for example, trying to watch reruns
of ESPN Sportscenter or the dreadfully.un—
funny cartoon “Aqua Teen Hunger Force”
in anything short of an alcoholic stupor?

4 Or paying for a loose, vertically striped

_“clubshirt,” ﬂare-legged Armani jeans and
a ridiculous “clubspike” hairdo if you weren’t
about to drink yourself into oblivion and
in the process forget how much money you
just spent?

On top of all that, beer has allowed Amer-

icans to expand their circle of friends to '

include any number of wretched, unpleasant
people they’d never associate with outside
of the neighborhood speakeasy. Under the
salutary inﬂuence of Bud Lite, however, such

' cretins become not only tolerable but also

wittier than all ﬁve founding members of
the Algonquin Round Table put together.
Bros in the full ﬂower of their youth can
take comfort in the gradual softening and
expanding of their bodies caused by one
too many Miller Lites, a pufliness that can
be passed off as weight room “hardgaining”
and disguised underneath the aforemen-

~ tioned loose, vertically striped clubshirts.

As our short review has ably demon-
strated, beer is undeniably the best.thing

ever. In addition to serving as the perfect _

accompaniment to some of life’s best ac-
tivities, such as procrastinating and playing
video games, it’s also the only proven cure
for a hangover. Whether you’re reaching for a
cold one at your best friend’s kegger or your
younger brother’s bris, you should pause
before imbibing to thankjakob Bier, Mickey
Mantle and all of the other brave pioneers
who fought to make your swig possible.

TONY’S TOP 10

Counting down best beveragesfor local sports

Tonyjovenitti

 

Beer: the almighty companion of every
sporting event. Beer advertisements
dominate Super Bowl commercials. Beer
"cans and bottles are omnipresent at tail-
gates for football and baseball games.
What else would we spend $8 a glass for
at—an arena? The answer is nothing.
Beer and sports go together like a ball
and a bat, a helmet and pads, a basketball
and ridiculously long_shorts, a hockey
puck andmissing teeth._ ‘
So for my Top 10 this we zk, I give you

, the best combination of bears and Pitts-

burgh sporting events.‘

10.. Hockey  Labatt Blue or Mol-
son. Nothing says hockey like your favor-
ite Canadian beer.

I 9. Pirates Opening Day - Bud Light
or Miller Lite. Opening day is a special
time for Pirates fans. This year, the team
was coming off a 4-2 road trip, so not only

was there eternal optimism, but the Pi- ‘

rates actuallylhad a winning record. That’
calls for a fun, yet relatively cheap, beer.
Bud Light and Miller Lite ﬁt the criteria
for this happy occasion. . l

8 . Pirates Regular Season — Coors‘
Light. The middle of the Pirates’ season
rarely breeds any optimism. By May,
they’re usually near the bottom of the

. standings. But hey, it’s summer. Baseball
games are still fun to attend. This time, .
‘ though, you’ll need a little bit of a lighter

beer ~— so you can consume more and for-
get about the Pirates’ woes. Coors_Light

is great for a mid—season Bucs game — as *

it’s nearly water.

7. Power _games — Heineken.'The

V Pittsburgh Power surged onto the local

sports scene this spring.rAccording'to
the commercials, arena football is “half

the field, twice the excitement.” Power,
games are pretty unique and exciting,

but it’s still just a little bit odd. So if you
atte'nd a game, you need something that
fits with arena football — something
that’s just a little off the beaten path.
Heineken is perfect for Power games.

It’s similar enough to taste like a regular ’
‘beer, but it’s just unique enough to be

considered a little different. Much like
arena football.

6 . Pirates end of season ~'— Penn Pil-
sner. When September comes, the Pirates

'season’has been over for four months.

Heck,‘ last year, the Bucs clinched their

‘ 18th straight losing season in'August. So

by September, Pirates fans need to switch

Senior Staﬁ” Writer V

to something a little bit stronger than Bud
or Coors Light. Penn Pilsner ﬁts the bill,
and its heavier taste will help you forget

the fact that the Pirates justvlost their

100th game of the season. Penn Pilsner

. also gets bonus points because it’s brewed
P on the North Side near PNC Park.

' 5 . Pirates in the playoffs — Cham-
pagne. If — by some odd alignment of

the stars — the Pirates do ever make the .

playoffs, beer will no longer be sufficient.
Most teams would save the bubbly for

when they win the World Series, but‘ if

the Pirates ever clinch a playoff berth,
it’s time to celebrate.

4. Pitt football — Natural Light.
Pitt football games are basically cheap-
er versions‘ of Steelers games — with a
few moredrunk students in attendance.
Nothing quite says college students like

Natty Light. You can take the frat party
from Friday night to the North Shore on
Saturday morning.

3. Steelers Season ‘— I.C. Light.,‘_
When Steelers season kicks off — if the
NFL actually has a season this year — it
calls for a celebration of Pittsburgh. I.C.
Light is the epitome of a Steelers beer.

Beer an increasingly prevalent food ingredient    

Randi Alu
Staﬁ“ Writer

In Pittsburgh, beer is_n’t relegated to
just being a drink _—— it can also en-
compass other aspects of a meal..
With such an easily identiﬁable
and complex ﬂavor, beer can give
foods a distinct quality — one that
ﬁts the character of Pittsburgh. From
the beer cheese sauce in your appe-
tizer to that beer-infused ice cream
dessert, local chefs are experimenting
with countless unconventional ways
to experience the drink.
Cooking with beer can be easy
and add quite a bit of ﬂavor. Accord-
ing to Chef Odette Smith—Ransome,

r_ .,a Pitt alumna who teaches at the Art

Institute of Pittsburgh, “It has a lot
of different components and it all
comes in one bottle. You can play
with it, too.”

As for the popularity of the pro-
cess, “In the United States we’re just
starting to touch on it. A

lot of European countries have
been doing it forever. The Germans
have always paired beer and

food. Now we have all these really
great little micro-breweries aroun ,”

Smith—Ransome said.

Local restaurants have been do-
ingjustthat. As part ofa partnership
with Church Brew Works on Liberty
Avenue, Dave and Andy’s makes ice
cream using the brewery’s beer in-
gredients.

“We provide Dave and Andy’s with
our wort. They incorporate it into the
ice cream,”_]ason Marrone, executive
chef at Church Brew Works, said in
an e-mail.

Wort is the component in beer

that ferments to make the drink alco- .

holic. This sweet liquid, which comes
from the mashing of grains, is not yet
fermented when used inthe ice cream
sold at Dave and Andy’s and Church
Brew Works. So the ice cream can’t

get you drunk, but it’s tasty like beer '

nonetheless. . -

In the words of Dave and Andy’s
manager Andrea Bianco, “It’s beer
before it’s alcohol.” In other words,
beer ingredients create the ﬂavoring
for ice cream like Vanilla Bean Golden
Ale before they become alcoholic.

The other two ﬂavors that Dave I

and Andy’s makes are Chocolate Bell
Tower Malt and Golden Ale Espresso
Chip. ' _

“We use light wort (celestial gold,

 

dark wort (dunkel, stout) for dark
ice creams,” Marrone said
Bianco said both_Dave and Andy’s

. and Church Brew Works beneﬁt from

the ice cream making. “We make [the
ice cream] and then they buy it off
of us to sell in their restaurant,” she
said.

Church Brew Works’ menu in-

cludes several beer—inﬁ1sed , includ- -

ing Beer Cheese Sauce, which is com-
posed of Pipe Organ Pale Ale, chicken
stock, cheddar cheese, carrots, celery
and onions.

“The beer cheese sauce is a per-
fectﬁtforaPhilly-style cheesesteak,”
Marrone said.

The sauce does hot contain al-
cohol because when it’s cooked to
become thicker, the alcohol evapo-
rates. Smith-Ransome believes that
cheese and beer are a good chemical
pairing.

“You can take shredded cheese
and pour beer over it, and the beer
will actually dissolve the cheese,” the
chef said.

Usingtechniques such as that one,
you can take the power of cooking
with beer into your very own home.

“It’s just like cooking with wine.
[Beer] has aigreat ﬂavor in and of it-

pale ale) for lighter ice creams and

 

     
   

self, and it has really good chemistry '

 

with food. Beer is really a tenderizer
for meat. Marinating in beer is, also
good —— just add your other season-
ings to it,” Smith—Ransome said.

An example of this process is
demonstrated in the Pit alumna’s
“Pittsburgh Barbecue.”

Her barbecue involves taking
a “lesser” meat such as a round or
chuck and placing it in a pan after
seasoning each side with salt and
pepper. She then pours 12 ounces of
Heinz ketchup and 12 ounces of Iron
City Beer over the steak and cooks it
for two hours.

Beer batteringis anotherpopular
method of working the drink into
food. '

Beer is used in batter for texture
rather than taste. “Regular batter is
leavened with bakingsoda orbakirig
‘powder. With beerbatter, the leaven-
ing is the beer. The effervescence of
the beer makes it light and crispy,”
Smith—Ransome said.

Leaveningis the chemical compo-
nentinbread products that produces
bubbles in order to make them rise.
Chemical leavenings include baking
soda andbaking powder, but a natu-
ral leavening is yeast. Because beer
contains yeast as well as preformed

agent. ~
Different kinds ofbeer are suited

. for different recipes.

“A Belgian ale is great sorbet. You
freeze it, essentially like a champagne
sorbet. It’s a great palette cleanser,
especially for a German dinner,”_
Smith—Ransome said. .

Using her barbecue as an exam-
ple, Smith—Ransome explained that
a dark beer would produce more of
a molasses ﬂavor, while a light beer
would bring out more of the tomato
notes. Light beers are called “light”
forareason—their strength ofﬂavor
is, well, lighter — and the bubbles are
smaller, Smith—Ransome said.

“I can see taking that original
two-part recipe and making a wide
variety of different end products,”.
the chef said. '

Experimenting is a great way
to experience new ﬂavor combina-
tions.

"Beer is an important aspect of
Pittsburgh culture. “You know that
saying about Pittsburgh: We’re abeer
town with a football problem — it’s
ufue. Back when the mills were here,
everyone’s favorite drinkwasaBoiler—
maker — beerwith a shot in it. It’s our
demographic and heritage around
here,” Smith-Ransome said. I

Containers < 6
Price: about $10 at Pizza Sola

Adding a literal “twist” to the bottled beer
world, the Vortex Bottle has been making people
wonder if it’s more than a gimmick since it came
outlast spring. - '

The actual “vortex” is a twist—effect in the
neck of the bottle that is touted to facilitate
easier pouring. (The beer is Miller Lite, so if you
like the frothy classic you’re ﬁne. If you don’t,
it’s- still the same taste and this isn’t going to
change your mind.) ’

The design of the bottles features a some:
what heitier glass, giving them a more solid
feel. Discountingthe actual ﬁmctionality ofthe
vortex, it’s a good—looking package.

As forthe vortex itself, it seems to work, but
it isn’t going to revolutionize bottles. For those
familiar with beer’s tendency to “chug” as it

A comes out, this bottle really seems to keep that

from happening. The grooves move the liquid

out at a smoother pace —-. preserving more of -

theca'rbonation—but overall the vortex seems

to solve a problem that seems  in the». I

Although available in 12-ounce six-packs
at some locations, the 32-ounce jug package

~ itself is ‘truly something beautiful. From the

Iron City. When the Steelers make it to
