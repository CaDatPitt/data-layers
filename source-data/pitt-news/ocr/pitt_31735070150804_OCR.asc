It’s March Madness time. But
in this tournament’, the winner
isn’t the team that puts the ball
in the basket most often. It’s the
team that gives the most back to
its community. ‘

Pitt’s service and nonservice

' groups will go head—to-head this

month in March Service Mad-
ness to see which of them can

’ do the most good in the com-

munity. As an added in:centive,

the winning group will tjeceive a ,

$500 cash reward to put toward
its next service project;

Mona Kazour, Student Gov-
ernment Board’s Conimunity
Outreach chairwoman, ‘said she
decided to have SGB hold Pitt’s
second annual March ;Service

V Madness because of the large

amount of student involvement
present in last year’s event.
The Office of Student Volun-

»teer Outreach will provide the
- funding for this year’s award.

Kazour said last year’s goal
was to achieve 17,000 service
hours, and members achieved
a little more than 19,000. This
year, their goal is to achieve
20,000, and she believes they
will easily achieve it. Currently,
60 student groups have signed
up to participate, but, accord-
ing to Kazour, the number keeps
growing every day. . . V

Although the 60 groups that

have currently signed up are

-service groups, Kazour said

she’s reached out to a number
of nonservice organizations and
expects many to participate. _
This year, SGB extended the
project to also include nonser-
vice groups — those that might
not already log volunteer hours
as part of their activities. Kazour

Andrew F ishman
For The Pizft News

A newly formed activist group at Pitt
plans to raise awareness among Pitt
students re ‘
garding the nation’s massive debt with a
schoolwide campaign to send postcards
to members of Congress, urging them
to stay in Washington and get their jobs
done. -

Pitt Kicks Back will launch its “No
Break, Don’t Come Home” campaign in
April by trying to get students to sign

the postcards. The more signatures the '

group gets, the more attention the post-
cards will receive; said club President
Carolanne Monteleone, a junior sociology
major at Pitt. ‘

“As average Americans, we can’t just
decide we*don’t want to go to work or
class,” Monteleone said. “We have elected
[members of Congress] to get a job done,
and that is what [they] need to be doing.”

Pitt Kicks Back is the Pittsburgh chap-
ter of the larger group The Can Kicks
Back, an organization dedicated to ﬁxing
America’s national debt issue. According
to its website, the organization focuses
on reducing the federal debt because of
its negative impact on the job environ-
ment, education, federal investment, tax
rates, national security, the environment,
health care and Medicare and social se-
curity.

Although just three weeks old, Pitt’s
chapter of The Can Kicks Back has already
hosted an event and attracted a vocal
following. .

“[We are a] group of students who are 

committed tozgetting our elected ofﬁ—
cials to- really focus on getting a budget
done,” said Monteleone. “Right now we
still don’t have a budget, and we are $16.5‘
trillion in debt. We are the generation
that is going to have [this] burden and
have our jobs and our future on the line.”
On Feb. 27, Pitt Kicks Back hosted its
first event, teaming up with Fix the Debt,

1 a Pittsburgh-area organization with a .

similar agenda. At the event, speakers
such as David Walker, a former govern-
ment ﬁnancial adviser, and David Patti,
president and CEO of the Pennsylvania

Business Council, spoke about how stu- .

dents can work to ﬁx the debt crisis in our
country and whatthe millenial generation
can do to help. .

Walker and Patti said the best solution
to the debt crisis is informing others.
And that’s exactly what Pitt Kicks Back

aims to do.
“We are just hoping to start spreading
awareness and promote more political

activism among our generation,” said -

member Natalie Grochowski, a junior
biology major at Pitt. “Our generation is
one of the least politically] informed. So
I think it is important just to stay aware
because it has such a personal effect on
every single person.” A-
National attention refocused on the
ballooning federal debt last Fridaywhen
the federal sequestration went into effect,
drastically cutting the federal budget. The
reductions include a $42.7 billion cut to
defense, a $28.7 billion cut to domestic
spending, a $9.9 billion cut from Medi-
care and $4 billion in reductions in other
areas, according to The Washington Post.
In total, the sequester cuts $85 billion
from federal spending over the next year
and $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years.
The sequester was a mechanism put
in place by President Barack Obama and

Congress in July 2011 to facilitate dis- A

cussion over a solvent, long-term debt

reduction deal. Obama and congressio-
nal Democrats sought increased revenue
through the raising of tax rates on Ameri-
can citizens earning more'than_$250,000
per-year. I
But congressional‘Republicans, hav-
ing conceded marginally higher tax rates
during the ﬁscal cliff negotiations in De-
cember, refused to budge on"‘the issue of
new revenue streams, instead calling for
cuts in social programs such as Medicare.
According to the Bipartisan Policy
Center, budget cuts made as a result of
the sequester could result in a loss of
about 1 million jobs, though the effects
will vary among sectors of the economy.
Pitt Kicks Back has been so focused
on its Fix the Debt event that members
haven’t had the time to discuss the newly
passed sequester as a group. , 7
“This dramatic cut happens because of
the irresponsibility of Congress,” Mon-

teleone said. “Because Congress couldn’t ’

come up with a sensible budget and re-
fused to work together, now there are
going to be thousands of cuts that are

going to hurt everyday Americans and or-
ganizations that really need the money.”
Club member Kristen Bolz, a junior

nursing major at Pitt, agreed with Mon-

teleone.

“I do not feel that this [sequester] is
adequate for the debt worth trillions. It is
significantly lower than what the federal
government had hoped,” said Bolz. “I
realize that ﬁxing the federal debt will
be a long process, but I feel that this will
barely have an impact.” .

The group members welcome views
and efforts from all political parties and
say they don’t afﬁliate themselves with
any one party. They will encourage in-
volvement from all parties at their

“No Break, Don’t Come Home” event
in April. . .

“We haveabout 10 members_at ou
meetings [right now], so we are [pretty
small,” Monteleone said. “But we are very
committed to getting this done, and we
would love to have more people in our
group who are committed to solving this
issue.”,|

back should contact the event’s organiz-
ers for suggestions of common commu-
nity service projects.

Kazour said that many of the organi-
zations earn service hours through par-
ticipating in activities such as Relay for
Life and volunteering at soup kitchens or
Family House, where volunteers provide
support and hope to families of hospital
patients through a variety of tasks, such
as providing meals.. .

Habitat for Humanity won last year’s
$500 prize with a total of 2,624 service
hours recorded in the month of March,
according to current club President Sas-
cha Steinberg.

According to Steinberg, each Saturday
volurfteers travel to three to five locations
to work with community organizations
such as Allegheny Valley and Greater
Pittsburgh Habitat for Humanity. There,
volunteers refurbish older, run-down
homes, transforming them into livable
places for families below the poverty line
as well as provide affordable housing for
victims of natural disasters.

According to the United States Census
Bureau, 22.2 percent of people in Pitts-
burgh and 12.6 percent of Pennsylvanians
lived below the poverty line from 2007 to
2011. For a family of four, the poverty line
is $23,050 in the United States.

Steinberg said Habitat for Humanity’s

approach helped lead to the group’s suc-
cess at the tournament.

“I think last year we had an advantage. 1

We went into March Service Madness
with a bunch of events already set up,
and then we just tried to add one or two
more locations to every weekend to up
our hours,” ‘she said. '

According to Steinberg, last year the .

group donated the prize money to Allegh-
eny Valley and Greater Pittsburgh Habitat
for Humanity. The group donated the
leftover money to Habitat for Humanity
through an international tithe: A dona-
tion made yearly, which goesto Habitat
for Humanity headquarters. * _

As an example of what the group
achieves, Steinberg shared details of a
recent project through which volunteers
helped the Allegheny Valley Habitat for
Humanity transform an old day care cen-
ter into a livable house for a family in
need a ofa clean and safe home.

Kazour said it’s hard to know if orga-
nizations campuswide actually increase
their service hours during the month of
March since this is the only time that
SGB keeps track of service hours, but she‘
suspects that is the case. .

“I think though that clubs tend to be
more active during this time because if

they hear the $500 is on the line, they A

are more willing to compete for it,” Ka-
zour said. » ‘ 0

with his concerns, Radziwon devised the
meeting with Louderback.

Board members and representatives
agreed that the best way club sports could
properly advocate would be to form an of-
ficial student organization. Though they
have an overarching president, and people
often reference the teams as onegroup,
currently, Pitt Club Sports is not a certi-
ﬁed student organization.

When a club sports team’s allocation re-
quest — often used for clues, equipment,
facility rental and competition expenses
in the form of lodging, transportation
and registration —— exceeds $500, it goes
before the Board to approve or deny the
allocations recommendation. The alloca-
tions manual currently outlines a $5,000

~ competition cap for team requests per

fiscal year. Precedence has allowed the
Board to break the cap for nationals.
Other, non—sport student organiza-

_ tions also approach the Board for requests

exceeding $500. They face a $2,000 con-
ference expense cap per ﬁscal year, and all
other requests — oftentimes for hosting
campus events, programing and speaker
expenses, transportation, equipment and
organizational dues — are kept in line
with funding precedence; A V ' ‘
Funding for these organizations comes

fromthe $2.3 million Student Activities .

Fund, to which all non-College of General
Studies Pitt undergraduates contribute
$80 each semester through the Student
Activities Fee.

At Wednesday’s meeting, Uhrmacher
said he felt that certain events received a
lot of funding from SGB.'The club sports
representatives pointed to the recent Hil-
lel allocation — which sparked disagree-
ment between Board members because it
broke precedent to allocate more money
—— and the $30,000 allocation for Pitt
Dance Marathon from last year and ques-
tioned why certain groups receive so much
money at one time.

Louderback explained that allocations
are based on how many students an event
will reach. Although $30,000 seems like
a lot of money, PDM reaches about 1,000
students, Louderback said, noting that

l\/larch 7, 20i 8 | The Pitt News l \/\/\/\/\/\/.Dlllt.i8WS.COtTl

an event for a club sport team would not
reach the same amount of people.
Though Uhrmacher expressed dis-

satisfaction with the current allocations ‘

process, Radziwon said he personally did
not see other team presidents express-
ing anger about allocations and did not
see anger as being productive. During
the meeting, Radziwon said he wanted to
promote a positive relationship between
SGB and the club sports teams.

“I think it opened a dialogue,” Radzi-
won said.

Radziwon questioned if the club sports
should form as a private student organiza-
tion or form a Student Affairs Affiliated
Group. -
Because they submit a yearly budget,
SAAGs do not have to petition every week
for funding. SAAGs include the Resident
Student Association, Interfraternity
Council, National Panhellenic Confer-
ence, Panhellenic Association, Black

. Action Society, Asian Student Alliance,

Engineering Student Cabinet and Nursing
Student Association. \
Louderback told the club sports pres-
idents that if they formed a group, he
would advise against forming as a SAAG
because they would have to form a budget
a year in advance, which would not align

with the unpredictable nature of sports’ "j
seasonal outcomes. Instead, Louderback‘
suggested that the club sports presidents

form a private student organization.
Louderback assured the club sports
representativesthat though it is not im-
mediately transparent, about one-third
of the Student Activities Fee goes toward
club sports. He presented an allocations
disbursement breakdown at the meeting
to demonstrate exactly how much money
SGB allocates towardclub sports teams.
Louderbacktrecommended that the
teams reconvene after spring break to

further discuss the matter and focus on.

making adjustments during the summer
academic recess. Ultimately, hefelt that
forming as one group would be a step in
the right direction for the teams, provid-
ing them with a more centralized voice
on campus.

“If it’s more structured with a com-
mittee, they can agree on what they’re
advocating for and have the authorityito
speak on it,” Louderback said. I

EDITORIAL GUEST COLUMN T g
This congressman is mad. Where
are the real conservatives?!

_ 5

Rohith Palli
( Kentucky - R)

Sticking it to liberals is the most im-
portant thing a House Republican
can do. It’s our House, and we need
to tame it. -

Sadly, this is not what Speaker
john Boehner has been doing in
2013.

Three times over the past two
months he has acceded to the Dem-
ocrats. Though it might be under-
standable to reauthorize extant leg-
islation such as the Violence Against
Women Act since it seemed to cause
such hubbub, it is totally unaccept-
able to break the Hastert rule_merely
to provide support to victims of Hur-
ricane Sandy.

The Hastert rule, the golden
rule of the House, is that a speaker
should not allow a bill to come to a
vote unless a majority of his party
supports the bill: If properly applied,
Boehner would seek our approval
before allowing bills to go through
on Democratic votes.

Despite his generally disastrous
tenure as speaker, last week Boehner
ﬁnally refused to negotiate with the
Ostentatious Budgeting And Money

- Allocator (OBAMA).Withthis stance,

he has shown the potential to at the

very least be mediocre. Improvement
will only happen if he realizes the
critical priorities in legislating.
First and foremost, he must al-
ways protect our biggest donors:
They paid for us to have the power
to help them. Second, he must always
pander to potential donors, espe-
cially corporations that like to take
advantage of the federal government.
When neither rule is applicable,
he must understandthat party comes
before principles, which come be-
fore (rich and elderly) people, which
come before everything and every-
one else. By breaking the Hastert
Rule, Boehner has been either put-
ting nation above party -— a cardi-
nal sin — or allowing the will of the
individual members of our party to
overshadow conservative principles.
Ultimately, Boehner is breaking
what is beautiful about the United

A States House of Representatives. It

is supposed to be a partisan politi-
cal machine in which legislation is

passed by half of half-'— the govern- «

ing 26 percent who represent the
exalted 0.1 percent.

Although only 19 percent of the
population voted for our party, we
wonamandate. The foundingfathers
created the great American system
so that men like Mr. Boehner could
protect the rights of a shrinking,

privileged and besieged minority.
Majority-minority districts, women’s
rights and dirty Democratic tricks
threaten this white males minority.

But ultimately, even if we con-
sider last week’s small moment of
sanity, Mr. Boehner has proven to
be afaﬂure, preventing entitlements
(such as marriage and voting rights)
from ﬂowing to people outside of
our base. He also failed in his critical
duty to reduce the government to
generate critical tax breaks for the
glorious job creators.

It is clear that the speaker is un-
able to fulﬁll his fundamental duties
as a conservative leader. His second
incommand, House Majority Leader
Eric_Cantorthe Magniﬁcent, is well-
suited for this role. We, the people of
the house, should have voted him
into power while we had the chance.

His credentials are impressive.
Mr. Cantor, in abrilliantpolicy—mak-
ing move, recently called for an end
to federal support of social science
research. The liberal hippies who
conduct “political science” and “ﬁs-
calpolicy” research are often looking
to “help the poor” or “ensure fair
representation.” These are not what
we as a nation should strive for.

POINT OF CLAIRE-ITY

Relationships won’t become boring unless you let them

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

I sometimes ﬁnd myself cringing while
watching shows such as “3o Rock” or “Girls,”
wherein the lead female character often says
painfully embarrassing things or otherwise
acts in a horriﬁcally awkward manner around
men. I can relate a bit too well for my own
comfort.

I am by no means a smooth-talking ro-
mance expert who should write a sex column
for “Cosmopolitan”. But among my history of
gauche blundering and uncertainty in situa-
tions with signiﬁcant others, and by merely
listening to the stories that others share with
me, I have learned a great deal about the “in a
relationship” status during the last few years.

College is a time for learning, and it’s
certainly a time to learn about how rela-
tionships work. But it seems as though we
rarely experience positive things at ﬁrst. I
have learned from the horror stories, both
my own and from others, what not to do in
arelationship.

Do not ever do the same thing over and
over again. Our lives are unbelievably sched-
uled already, with classes, part—time jobs,
internships and other commitments we’ve
stupidly made ﬁlling the vast majority of any
given 24-hour period.

Scheduling time to see someone during

I the week, considering our obligations, can be

difficult. It is perfectly normal to realize that

you and your signiﬁcant other might only be
able to see each other Mondays for approxi-

, mately 73 minutes before night class and

Wednesdays for 28 minutes during lunch.

By no means do your time constraints
suggest that you must similarly constrain
the list of possible minidates you can ﬁt into
your schedule. Be a little bit unpredictable.
When your friends can guess where you went
on your date every time the two of you are
together, it’s time for a change.

.Go somewhere different for lunch. Try
some new food. Of course, being adventurous
during the week is difficult, so take advantage
of the weekends.

Surprises are nice. Get her roommate to
let you in so you can drop off some soup when
she hasn’t been feeling well all day. Check
Redbox for that movie you know he’s wanted
to see that might sound like 90 minutes of
pure boredom to you. Step out of the norm
you’ve established for yourselves.

With that being said, some unpredictable
moments are more horrifying than excit-
ing. Shocking him with your detailed ideas
of your perfect wedding — with him as the
groom, of course — is not acceptable a mere
two weeks into the relationship. Sketching a
portrait of her, unless you’re a very talented
artist, is ill—advised. These worry your signiﬁ-
cant other instead of wooing them.

I know what you’re thinking: How can I
afford to be interesting? ‘

But another “no” in the relationship world

is using money as an excuse for anything.

We are college students. The majority
of us live paycheck—to—paycheck, working
minimum—wage university jobs. We certainly
are not the type to venture to LeMont on
Mount Washington for a date.

There are so many things that college
couples can do for free or on a small budget.
As we are all aware, the buses in Pittsburgh
are free with our Panther Cards. You can
expand your horizons outside of Oakland’s
borders quite easily, even if the buses don’t
come as frequently as we prefer.

That Panther Card gets you free admis-
sion to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh,

"and a number of other attractions in the

area are also free or offer reduced prices
for students. '

Meals can be tough, especially when
you’re living in residence halls. However,
once the weather gets nice, a picnic in Schen-
ley Plaza with simple PB&_] sandwiches can’t
go wrong, and it’s minimally harmﬁil on your
bank account. If someone has a real kitchen
with a stove, cook dinner for yourselves. It’s
inﬁnitely cheaper than going out. So what if
you can’t cook? You can have ﬁm attempting
it and will laugh all the way to Antoon’s when
you have to resort to sharing a cheap pizza.

Essentially, complaints of poverty are use-
less. Even for a good portion of the underage
crowd, we all have the money to buy that ﬁfth
of Smimoff for the weekend. Here’s a novel
idea: Put that booze money toward treating

him or her to dinner every once in a while.
Save up for your signiﬁcant others — they’re
worth it. Women, this means you should buy
dinner for him sometimes too.

Though it might be a cliched notion, hon-
esty istruly the best policy from day one.
Pretending to be someone or something you
aren’t will absolutely come back to haunt you.

Think of the movie “Easy A,” in which
Emma Stone’s character lies about her sex
life — cue the downward spiral. Your experi-
ences have to be out in the open. Yeah, that’s
awkward. But your boyfriend or girlfriend
will know how slowly to take things if he or
she is aware.

Furthermore, if someone can’t respect
you for the things you stand for in terms of
sex, get rid of that person as soon as possible.
A boyfriend or a girlfriend who isn’t OK with
your choices is not.OK for you in the ﬁrst
place. Show them to the door immediately
and lock it behind them if they can’t accept it.

And no, interpreting things through
Facebook, hearing from a friend of a friend
or in some fashion other than from your
signiﬁcant other does not count as the truth.

With that said, enjoy your relationships. If
the two of you aren’t having fun, something is
wrong. You have to live a little: Do something

out of the ordinary. Even if you fail miserably, ,

it’s still the thought that counts. At least, until
you really screw up. I

As majority leader, he understands that
these ideas are contrary to the true goals of
government. Engendering positive feelings
toward the government in the masses merely
increases the difficulty of the task set out for
the great GOP: diverting tax money to large
corporations.

The removal of social science funding al-
lows The Great Eric Cantor to simultaneously
lower taxes on the middle class and remove

accountability from the government. Ulti-
mately, it’s all about protecting what we call
the middle class — that group of Americans
willing to donate money to those who keep
their taxes lowest.

Cantorwould have saved us. There would be
no negotiation with OBAMA, ensuring earlier
enactment of the sequester. The best thing
since Reagan tax cuts, the sequester hurts no
one: not the furloughed workers, not the poor,
not the ﬁiture. There is no education lost or
scientiﬁc momentum delayed. In fact, through
the forces of natural selection, our educational
and scientific institutions will emerge from

scarcity signiﬁcantly strengthened.

The only thing we should ever want or need
is the pure bliss of deﬁcit reduction. That’s what
drew me to Washington inthe ﬁrst place. Never
believe there is any other goal. You might hear
that current interest rates for U.S. debt are
negative and that we could essentially borrow
money for free, but resist the urge. It is just a
trap and a scam, just another way forsocialists
to make investments in the future and pay for
frivolities such as education and infrastructure.
Why else would the leader of the socialist intel-
lec_tual movement, Paul Krugman, champion it?

Cantor understands that these are bad

ideas. This is America: We only borrow money
to defend our great nation, not to invest in
brainwashing and roads to nowhere. This is
why the oath of ofﬁce for a member of the
House of Representatives reads, “I  swear 
that I will  defend the  United States against
 foreign  faith  So help me God.” -
Affirmed by our faith, this creed makes

it clear what the goal is as a House member: -

to uphold the position of God and crusade

against those of other faiths. Eric Cantor, the

best candidate for speaker, understands this.

Choosingjohn Boehner was a mistake. I

CGNCERT REVEEW

MGK tore up Altar Bar with high-energy performance

Matt Singer
For The Pitt News

With palpable impatience, a young crowd
garbed in ragtag bandanas and “I’m Laced
Up!” shirts let out a groan each time the lights
dulled, luring the concergoers into thinking
the show was about to start. Although people
danced and cheered for the opening acts, it
was done halfheartedly. The crowd only truly
came to life once Machine Gun Kelly made
his entrance.

Flanked by his band and two enormous
speakers, Machine Gun Kelly allowed his

vocals to explode throughout the Strip Dis— '

trict’s Altar Bar on Monday. He gripped the
microphone tightly, as_if he would fall to the
ﬂoor if he let go, and showcased the rapid-
ﬁre delivery that earned him his stage name.

Machine Gun Kelly, or MGK, has said in
the past that he kills himself every time he
goes on stage, and it’s easy to see why, as
there wasn’t a single moment of his set during
which he wasn’t moving.

The American rapper packed a huge
amount of energy and emotion into his per-
formance. Despite constantly darting "around
the stage, he never displayed any sign of being
tired — just signs of being happy to perform.

The crowd didn’t show any fatigue either
and had no trouble keeping up with him
during his set. Although crowd members

simmered to near silence whenever MGK
went on long, high—speed lyrical bursts, their
excitement boiled over each time, and they
found themselves too excited to contain the
desire to rap along.

“Those kids will sing every word,” said
the 22-year-old Clevelander in an interview
before the show. “And those words aren’t easy
to keep up wit .”

The perforrner—cro_wd cooperation"

seemed to reach its climax during MGK’s
performance of “Wild Boy,” one of his most
popular songs.

As soon as the song started, MGK mounted
one of the stage’s large speakers and climbed
up to the venue’s second—ﬂoor balcony. Once
there, he walked catlike along the narrow
ledge and got into as many of his fans’ faces
as he could. They extended their arms to hold
him for balance while he leaned off the edge
and continued to perform.

That is, until he jumped into the crowd
from the second story.

“Don’t let ‘Ocho Cinco’ and ‘Wild Boy’ fool
you. I do those so I don’t sound preachy,” he
warned before the performance.

He eventually found his way to the bar,
which he used as a runway into the scream-
ing and grabbing mass of fans all trying to
get closer to him. He invited some to dance

MUSIC

Nominees for this year’s W/oodie Awards

Matt Singer
For The Pitt News

There’s a long—standing axiom that MTV
stopped playing “real” music a long time ago.

Possibly in an effort to combat that idea, the
company created mtvU, a spinoff geared speciﬁ-
cally toward college students and their music.
The Woodie Awards, mtvU’s yearly awards cer-
emony, which will take place March 17, praises
“the music voted best by college students.”

This year’s nominees are scattered across
a hodgepodge of award categories and musi-
cal genres. From the likes of Kendrick Lamar,
Grimes, Zedd, Alt-J, fun. and Earl Sweatshirt, the
roundup seems to have something for everyone,
encompassing the tastes of most students on a
college campus.

In a conference call with multiple college re-
porters, nominees Dillon Francis, A$AP Rocky
and Machine Gun Kelly answered questions
about their respective genres, ﬁitures and per-
sonal lives.

Quesﬁon: You used to be one of the pioneers
of the moombahton scene, but you started do-
ing a lot more trap—y stuff. I just want to hear
your opinion on the moombahton scene and

where it’s going and where the trap scene is
going. ‘ - ‘

Dillon Francis: I think they are just going to
keep growing. The reason trap has grown faster

is because it’s closer related to dubstep. But it’s *

just like minimal dubstep, and that’s why it was

able to take so quickly. Moombahton wasn’t
really a genre —— I don’t really think that there
was anything really made at that tempo that
was electronic.

Q: How much work and time goes into the
music you make, and how do you know when
it’s perfect enough to release to the public?

DF: Oh man, so much time. Hopefully I’ve
clocked almost like .._. I’m aiming for 10,000
hours. Hopefully I’ll get there in the next year
-— I think I will. A lot of time goes into it, and
the way I know it’s done is if I listen to it in my
car or on my phone, and there’s nothing on that
 makes me mad about it, then I’ll be able to
put it out to the public.

Q: Who are you planning on collaborating
with next, and who would be your dream col-
laboration?

A$AP Rocky: I’m gonna collaborate with
Tame Impala. They’re like this indie group.

My dream collaboration would probably be
with somebody like John Lennon, but that’s

. not gonna happen.

Q: Were you a little bit salty about your al-
bum getting leaked early? A V

A$AP: Yeah, I was salty. At ﬁrst I was just
like, “Oh man, that’s messed up.” Ifelt so much

better when people came up to me like, “Yo, I’m -

sorry I listened to it, but it’s amazing. I’m going
to get the real thing!” Ijust started hearing that
a lot. You know, I just ﬁgured, “Man, this is what

_ I really wanted.”

Q: Back during ajanuary interview with an
MTV afﬁliate, you said that one of your New
Year’s resolutions was to stop sleeping with
so many diiferent women. Do you think that’s
going to make it difficult to compete in a mu-
sic genre where sexual conquests are seen as
standard tropes? '

A$AP: Yeah, because it’s just one of those
things that’s so normal that people don’t care.
It’s ‘ just one of those nonchalant things, like
whatever, it happens, you know? I don’t want

‘to be looked at as just a dog anymore. Now here

we are. I’m trying to be avgood guy.

reveal personal styles

Q: Where do you fall on the debate over
exposing young children to what some people
consider the negative aspects of rap music, and
at what age would you feel comfortable with
your daughter, Casie, listening to an album such
as Lace Up, which features references to past
drug use, violence and partying?

Machine Gun Kelly: Well, I really don’t think M

the album focused on partying at all. I mean,
outside of just the “Wild Boy” song. I mean,
beingin all types of things thatlwent through,
I mean, I want my daughter to know what I
went through. I want her to know what I did
to provide for her. I did a lot of things I’m not
proud of to provide for her. But at the end of
the day, she’s one of the smartest 3—year—olds'I
know. She has a beautiﬁﬂ life now. You know,
the more you shield children, the more they’re
gonna want to act out. .

. Q: For those who don’t know MGK, how
would you describe yourselfand your music be-
hindallof the tattoos and the wild—boy lifestyle?

MGK: I think it’sjustavoice of a generation.‘ ~ V

That’s how I describe it. It’s the voice of those '
kids that are working at the gas station just to
save enough money up tq get a ticket to come
to my ‘show. I '

‘21 85 Over’ disappoints ‘ audiences with immature vulgarity

Brett Murphy
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

“21 & Over”
Directed by: Jon Lucas and Scott
Moore

Starring: Miles Teller, Skylar Astin, ‘

Justin Chon .
Grade: C+

Jeff Chang — or “JeffChang” as his friends
call him — has the biggest interview of his
(father’s) life tomorrow. But tonight, inciden-
tally, is the eve of his 21st birthday, and Jeff
Chang’s two best friends from high school
"have shown up to usher the overachieving
premed student into manhood with his ﬁrst
legal bar crawl.

“21 & Over” tries hard for the wild and ’

raunchy laughs immortalized by “The Hang-
over,” but ﬁrst-time directors and “Hangover”

writersjon Lucas and Scott Moore fail to tap _

/ into the college atmosphere they try so hard

to create. It shows college through the lens of
a yearning high schooler, portraying it as a
consequence—free haven of beautiful people,
free beer and mechanical bulls. Not totally far
off, but the collegiate setting doesn’t make
their antics any funnier or more ludicrous,
just slightly more believable. ’
The ﬁlm relies heavily onchauvinistic hu-

mor, mostly spewing from under the visor of
Miller (Miles Teller), the community—college
dropout and party animal who acts as the

driving force behind the wild night out. The’

humor starts to ﬁzzle when“21 8: Over” tries
to ground its leads in latent sentimentality
and emotion, and Miller’s frat-boy act loses
any vulgar wit and becomes a little sad.

Lucas gives his hand in directing, and al-
though he demonstrates deﬁnite moments
of effective absurdity —— such as Jeff (Justin
Chon) sprinting through the quad wearing
nothing but a teddy bear (you see a lot of
nakedjeff) — the movie suffers fromsuch a
low-stakes plot. J

After one drink turns into 20, Miller and

his former best friend Casey (Skylar Astin)
are lost on campus, and the birthday boy is
either missing completely or takes the form of
a rag doll for the rest of the movie. And as the
hours until his big interview in the morning
dwindle, it becomes clear that the one-time
triumvirate is not what it used to be. Miller,
resilient in his nihilistic worldview, butts
heads with Casey, a Stanford standout in a
tie and sweater with a job already lined up
after graduation. ‘
Casey’s'future—oriented, work-hard men-
tality is at odds with the play—hard school of
thought to which Miller subscribes. His phi-
losophy is, “We gotta do as much crazy sh*t as

- we can before we graduate.” Astin and Teller

have good give—and-take with each other, and
many students can relate to their qualms. .
They don’t know anybody on campus, so
the team has to bounce around bars, parties
and sorority houses in search ‘of clues for
Jeff ’s address. And in their hunt for his house,
they learn some troubling facts about their
evidently estranged friend’s college life.

Successﬁilly getting Jeff home becomes
a metaphor for getting him ﬁgured out and
resurrecting the relationships that unraveled
after graduation. He might not be quite the
ambitious and aspiring doctor he has led his
friends to believe he is, and his situation is all
too familiar for those stuck in the shadow of
an overbearing parent. '

. Still, even with the deeper underpinnings
that try to‘ make the drunken college kids,
something more, you’re not too worried about
their state of affairs. Plus, in the age of smart-
phones, it’s difficult to believe they can’t ﬁnd
their way back.

.“21 8: Over” comes close to the laughs it
shoots for, but the uneven tone and lack of a
scene—stealing performance from any of its
leads holds it back. The utopian —~ or perhaps
dystopian — image of college that the movie
posits will go over well with younger crowds,
but the not-so subtle anti—Semitism, poop

' jokes and routinely exposed pubic regions

— among other pleasant vulgarities — won’t
sit well with most audiences. -

Pittsburgh music scene measures upagainst

As someone who answers the question,‘

“Where are you from?” with “outside of
Philly,” I had low expectations for the Pitts— ‘° .
burgh music scene upon my arrival. I’m used . - 3

to choosing from multiple house shows when
planning my evening, and I’m-used to people
telling me which shows will be great and which

-will not because that’s what Philly kids are
like —— they like noisy punk music and being
right about everything. '

But Pittsburgh is conveniently located on ‘

the path from Philadelphia to Cleveland. This
is a beneﬁt to both Pittsburgh-dwellers and
traveling bands. It offers a low—key concert
setting for larger bands that just need a rest
and gives us showgoers a wider selection of
shows to attend within a few hours’ drive.
V There is also something about the Midwest
that seeps into western Pennsylvania and
makes everyone a little friendlier than back
East. It’s the perfect setting for a beautiful
‘music scene. _

living 18 years in the pound. It took a_ little
while before I learned to relax. Iwas hesitant

and failed attempts to learn myway around

Then, when I could no longer ignore the’

the comfort of a loud, cramped basement
—— I ventured out. I knew/it would either be a
wonderful surprise or anotherreason to miss

terribly inﬂated Philadelphia ego and found
myself humbled by the charm of Pittsburgh.

My ﬁrst experience was at a show in the
South Side. The band playing, Adventures,
had put out an EP a few weeks earlier, and I
had been listening to it nonstop. I dragged a
friend along with me in case things went sour,

and we soon found ourselves standing in a a
crowd of-burly, bearded men in leather j ackets. _

In any other scenario I would have felt
uncomfortable being one of two small women
among metalheads, but something about that
Pittsburgh atmosphere made it seem perfectly
all right. Everyone was polite and welcoming.
It was_a great time — metalheads deﬁnitely
know how to mosh, ‘

Perhaps the most important element that
differentiates Pittsburgh shows from Phila-
delphia shows is the people. Maybe it’s that
Midwestern politeness again, or maybe it’s
because there is less pressure to become the
typical “Philly a**hole,” but you will never feel
unwelcome at a Pittsburgh show.

Bakari Thompson, an undergraduate communications major, responded “class” when
asked to describe his-style in one word. He recalled that even in kindergarten he loved to
wear suits and that “in all [his] class pictures [he would] be wearing them.” In high school
he had to wear uniforms, so coming to college provided him with a sense of urgency to put

“more thought into what he chooses to wear. He attributes his sense of color coordination
to the limitations regarding what he could wear in high school. He ﬁnds inspiration from
a lot of magazines, with GQ as his top choice.

house shows. A tiny, rank basement in South
» Oakland is, to me, much more appealing than
a large venue. You can mingle for a little and
then head back down to the basementand get
your dance on. It’s a beautiful ebb and ﬂow of
moving and, relaxing. - _
The house show has something for ev-
eryone. I attended one a couple weeks ago
that featured’awesomeelectronic mixing in
the basement and Elton John on tape in the
kitchen. The contrast between dirty dance
music and “Benny and the Jets” is like jump-
ing in the ocean after heating up on the beach:
absolutely refreshing. ’ l
Though I am constantly exploring, there is
still so much to Pittsburgh that is unknown to
me. I’ve got a few bands I like to follow around,
but every time I go out, I fall in love with a new
one. I don’t ever want to hear anyone say they
“wish Pittsburgh had a music scene” again.

  Matt Wilps
Dustin Gabler
Senior Stay?’ Wrz'terv

Pitt wrestling captain, redshirt senior ‘
and No. 3—ranked 197—pounder Matt Wilps.

doesn’t talk much.

“He is a man of a few words,” said Zac
Thomusseit, fellow senior and captain. “

But his quiet manner doesn’t isolate
him. Instead, the cool demeanor of the
Oakdale, Pa., native, who graduated from
Chartiers Valley High School, spreads
throughout the team. You won’t see many
Pitt wrestlers slam their headgear or pa-
rade around the mat after a match. Win or
lose, they simply shake their opponent’s
hand and return to the bench, like Wilps
does after each of his matches, which
usually end in victory.

“Wilps stays calm and collected. He
works his game plan and is able to win
at the highest level of [Division I] wres-
tling,” Thomusseit said. “That definitely
carries over to myself and the rest of the
team.”

Aside from passing along his manner,
Wilps serves as a model wrestler for the
underclassmen on -the No. 16 Pitt wres-
tling team to follow. His record includes
a fourth-place finish at the 2012 NCAA
wrestling championships.

“It helps having him on this team be-
cause he is already an All-American,” red-
shirt junior P.J. Tasser said. “It shows the
younger guys on the team the discipline
it takes to achieve our goals.”

Without saying any words, Wilps
pushes all other Panthers to spend just
as much time as he does becoming better
wrestlers through his work ethic. When a

Panthers use momentum to earn four straight victories

Dave Uhrmacher
Stqff W riter

After dropping the first game of the week-
end to a nationally ranked opponent, the
Pitt softball team earned four—consecu—

tive victories this past weekend at the »

Citrus Classic in Kissimmee, Fla.

The successful weekend improved the
Panthers’ record to 9-6 on the young
season. And with Big East play begin-
ning in just a few weeks, Pitt gained some
needed conﬁdence fromits quality per-
formances. '

No. 13 Louisiana-Lafayette 8, Pitt 0
The top-15 Ragin’ Cajuns chased Pitt

sophomore starting pitcher Savannah
King from the game after only 2 1/3 in-
nings of work with their powerful batting
order. After allowing six hits and five
earned runs, King gave the ball to fresh-
man Lauren Vinson in the pitching circle.

By the time the pitching change oc-
curred, Pitt couldn’t climb back into the

game against a hard-hitting Louisiana-

Lafayette lineup. The Ragin’ Cajuns (_14—
2), who reached base in 16 of their 25
at-bats, displayed pure dominance on
the mound.too. Pitt managed just seven
hits, led by freshman leadoff hitter Tori
Nirschl’s two-hit performance.

But the Panthers couldn’t string to-
gether enough hits to cross the plate at
any point in the game as they were shut

out for the second time this season.

Pitt 3,]ames Madison 2

A’ In their second game of the Citrus
Classic on Friday, the Panthers recorded
their first win overjames Madison. Left-
ﬁelder Nirschl led the charge again for
Pitt, going 3-for-4 at the plate and scoring
two of the Panthers’ three runs.

After sophomore starting pitcher Al-
exa Larkinconceded two runs in the top
of the ﬁfth inning, Pitt needed a little
late—game magic to overcome the Dukes
(7-4). Following a walk to pinch-hitter
freshman Kathryn Duran, a single from
Nirschl and another base on balls to
freshman Ashlee Sills, the stage was set
with the bases loaded for senior catcher

Holly Stevens to be the hero. But her at;

6

bat resulted in a fielder’s choice and a ‘

close out call at the plate, leaving the
Panthers with only one out remaining
to salvage a tie or win.

Freshman Taylor Henry stepped up to
the plate, and she delivered. A ground-

ball single through the left side allowed“-

sophomore Carly Thea to cross the plate
to tie the game with Nirschl not far be-
hind, capping the walk-off win for Pitt.
“That was a big win for us, and it
turned our weekend around,” Henry said.
“It was a cool feeling, and Alexa pitched.

Young Panthers stepping up
could help Pitt in long run

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

With spring football practice beginning‘

this week and the new college football sea-
son slowly closing in, Pitt head coach Paul
Chryst has an opportunity to do something
that NFL coaches across the nation would
love to do.

Coach Chryst can get younger players at
multiple positions and likely not see much
of a drop in talent. Although most players
are young in relation to their counterparts
in the NFL, placing underclassmen in key
roles leads to a more successful team in
the future. -

If freshmen and sophomores crack the
starting lineups for the Panthers this sea-
son, Pitt football could set up for a banner
year while not giving up much, if anything,
in 2013.

By adding ﬁve offensive linemen in the
recruiting class of 2013, Chryst made a
strong statement, indicating that the depth
and talent Pitt had wasn’t enoughat these
ﬁve vital positions. ‘

The Panther blockers allowed quarter-
back Tino Sunseri to get sacked 38 times in
2012 — leaving him tied for fourth—worst in
the NCAA — and the unit lost its two best
linemen, center Ryan Turnley and guard
Chris Jacobson,'to graduation.

Redshirt freshman Adam Bisnowaty
provides youth and talent at left tackle.
The coaches moved_last year’s left tackle,
Cory King, to guard — a move that all but

Redshirt resha rteack Chad Votik willcopete for thestig
job next season. Bobby Mizia |Assistant Visual:-Editor

asks Bisnowaty to take the job.
Bisnowaty’s backup for the job entering
spring practice isjuantez Hollins, who was
suspended for the 2012 season. Hollins, a
senior, offers no long-term beneﬁt to the
Panthers. If Bisnowaty earns the starting
job, coaches can pencil him in as the starting
left tackle for the next four years. _
Dorian Johnson, a ﬁve—star offensive
lineman from Belle Vernon, Pa., and Pitt’s
top 2013 recruit, will also add depth to
the blocking corps. However, the 6-foot-6
prospect won’t arrive in Oakland until the

summer, limiting his chance at winning

the other tackle position. But don’t rule it
out completely.

Previously, only once-in—a—generation
talenqwould start as freshmen on the of-
fensive line, but in recent years, several
have jumped right in to start at much more
elite schools than Pitt.

Johnson has a good combination of skill
and a fortunate situation. Pitt’s current

_ starter at right tackle is T._]. Clemmings,

who played defensive end until after the
ﬁnal regular-season game in 2012.
Another incoming recruit on offense to
watch is four-star wide receiver Tyler Boyd.
The wide receiver from Clairton, Pa., won

, three—straight state championships and
‘will bring talent and a history of success

with him to Pitt.
Like Johnson, Boyd won’t arrive un-
til this summer, but his path to starting

nice to take that game and carry that into
the rest of the weekend.”

Pitt 13, Long Island 5

The Panthers.carried the momentum
from the walk-offvictory less than 24
hours before pouncing on Long Island
University-Brooklyn. Henry led Pitt as
her ﬁrst—inning double put the Panthers
up 2-0. The Panthers would push the lead
to 4-0 before Long Island (2-16) could get
out of the inning. _

Nirschl and sophomore third baseman"
Carissa Throckmorton both recorded
three hits in the game, which only lasted
five innings because of the Panthers’ po-
tent offense, King homered for Pitt in
the designated—hitter spot, but Larkin
pitched all five innings, allowing four
earned runs and striking out six.

Pitt 13, Fordham 0 _

The Panthers’ offensive juggernaut
continued Saturday into the second game
of the doubleheader as Pitt scored 13 runs
for the second—consecutive game. Back-
to-back solo home runs from Nirschl and
Throckmorton to start gave the Panthers
an early 2-0 advantage. Both hitters
would eventually tie for the team lead
in hits with four each.

“I was focusing on trying to get on base I

and set my team up for offensive success,”

said Nirschl, who earned a spot on the
Big East Honor Roll. after her nine-RBI
weekend. “We lost one of our best hitters
in Maggie Sevilla to injury, and I was try-
ing to do everything I could to alleviate’
for that loss. I just tried to do the little
things right and let the rest of the team
take care of business that I knew they
were fully capable of doing.”

King pitched all five innings, working

out of multiple no-out situations with

runners in scoring position through the
assistance of her infield, which forced
critical outs at home plate. Fordham (5-
9) sprayed six hits over the five innings
but left eight runners on base. Henry’s
four RBIs led the charge as the Panthers
recorded 26 runs on 27 hits in only 10
innings of play Saturday.

Pitt 5, Fairﬁeld 3

For the second game in a row, the Pan-
thers received a complete game from King
in the circle, which helped extend the
team’s winning streak to four games.

“Both King and Larkin had really good
outings, and they set the tone for us,”
head coach Holly Aprile said. “They got
better as they went on, and we talked
about getting ahead of batters being im-
portant and then trying to pick parts of
the plate. They were also able-to elimi-
nate walks and extra base hits. Both did
a very nice job.”

"is much easier. Outside of ‘obvious No. 1

target Devin Street, Pitt’s remaining wide

. receivers have caught 29_passes in their

careers collectively. V j .

The position of wide receiver is also
much easier to adjust to from high school
to college than spots on the offensive line.

On the defensive side of the ball, one
position provides a clear opportunity for
a freshman to prove his worth, and that is
middle linebacker.

Starter Shane Gordon will miss spring
practice because of a neck injury, and
backup Dan Mason can’t play indeﬁnitely
because of an off-the—ﬁeld issue.

Redshirt freshman Mike Caprara began
spring drills with the ﬁrst team because of
this situation, but it’d be a huge surprise
to seethe undersized Caprara capture the
starting job. Gordon will likely resume
his starting role in the fall, but if Caprara
demonstrates skill, it will ease the coaches’
worries.

Gordon is an injury-prone player, and

2o13’s backup middle linebacker will see
some playing time. The coaches hope Gor-
don can stay healthy, but his history shows
that cannot be guaranteed.

Fans won’t have high expectations for
Caprara, but he could surprise them if he
enjoys a_ good spring and works just as hard
in the summer. Either way, Pitt will search
for a new starting middle linebacker in
2014, so some productive playing time for
Caprara could go a long way.

With underclassmen starters Rushel
Shell at running back andj.P. Holtz at tight
end, the Panthers already boast a solid
young core, and that core could grow next

- season if players such as Bisnowaty,]ohnson

and Capara step up.

The future is bright for Chryst’s Pan-
thers; . ' .

If several of those freshmen and sopho-
mores see the ﬁeld for meaningful playing
time in 2013, they could all conceivably
peak together, setting up a potential ACC
championship—caliber team in 2014 or 2015.

Throckmorton and sophomore Kaila Ba-
latgek each hit home runs as the Panthers
knocked off Fairﬁeld (5-4) on Sunday. Stags
pitcher Lauren Falkanger‘ carried a no—hit
bid into the top of the fourth inning, but"
Throckmorton put an end to that play with
a solo shot that cut Fairﬁeld’s lead to 3-1, her

. second solo shot in two days.
Following singles from Henry and Ste— ' "

vens, sophomore Kaila B,alagtek’s three-run
homer gave the Panthers their ﬁrstlead of

ﬁve and walking only one.

The road ahead

The Panthers resume play Friday, March

at 3:30 p.m. The game marks the ﬁrst of ﬁve
games for Pitt next weekend as part of the

V Sun Devil Classic, hosted by No. 3—ranked
71 Arizona State. Pitt faces the Sun Devils twice

this weekend in what could be the team’s
most difficult challenge of the season, but
that is exactly what Aprile wanted. ,

“It is important to expose yourselves to

“When I’m getting tired and need to
push myself, Matt is always there to give
me a shove and keep coming at me,” Tho-
musseit said. “I owe a lot of my success
to Matt as my workout partner for five
years.”

The All—American doesn’t need many

tice, in matches or in the weight room.

“[Wilps] sets the bar extremely high
for all ofus,” Tasser said. “He is a prime
example of how far hard work and dedi-
cation can take you in this sport.”

Wrestling is a sport in which freshmen .
often become All—Americans because
of their natural talent — Wilps wasn’t
one of those wrestlers. His growth as
a wrestler can only be attributed to his A
hard work. A '

As a freshman, Wilps tallied a medio— A
cre 17-17 record before breaking out his
sophomore year and earning his first trip
to the NCAA tournament. However, he
won only one match on his sport’s big-
gest stage at the college level.

. Although his performance improved
his second time around at the NCAAS
last season, there’s a sense of urgency
on behalf of the soft-spoken wrestler as
he nears his final national tournament.

the back of my mind and try tojust enjoy
the competition,” Wilps said.

For Wilps, the goal is clear: win the ’

197-pound national championship by
pummeling every wrestler who steps on
the mat with him.

“My mentality has been to not give
an inch, destroy my opponents and only
think about one match at a time,” he
said of his strategy for his final NCAA
tournament.

He also plans on being “more focused
and intense” this time around.

With the Panthers’ team schedule
over, only.two tournaments remain on
the slate: the Eastern Wrestling League
tournament in Edinboro, Pa., March 9
and the NCAA tournament in Des Moines,
Iowa, from March 21 to March 23.

The next month will determine the
legacy of Pitt’s best wrestler, and Wilps
hopes all of his hard work will culminate
in achieving what he set out to do when
he arrived at Pitt five years ago.

“I have put a lot of hard work into
this, so to achieve the ultimate goal of
the sport [winning a national champion-
ship] would mean a ton to me,” he said.

How much does it mean to him? Well,
the soon—to—be graduate, with a degree in
economics, doesn’t want to think about

‘anything other than winning a national

championship right now.

“I have no plans [after school],” Wilps
said. “I’ve been focusing on finishing my
wrestling career.” I
