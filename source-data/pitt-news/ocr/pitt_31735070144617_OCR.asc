Some Pitt students won’t have
to copy a friend’s notes when they
miss class.

A new Web site, GradeGuru.
com, allows them to download
them instead.

Launched in June, the free
Web site lets users upload lecture
notes, study guides and other rele-
vant course materials in exchange

for rewards, such as money and

‘ trips. The GradeGuru.com staff -

and clients give their feedback on
the quality of the notes, and the
company uses an algorithm to cal-
culate, based on the quantity and
quality of the notes, how much
students should be rewarded.
The site offers 75 cents for
short lecture notes from one ses-
sion, $3 for comprehensive notes

from a single session, $10 for an .

Recruiting
still a battle
for Dixon

by Jay Huerbin
Staﬂ Wrtrer

Just 10 years ago, the Pitt men’s
basketball team failed to reach ei-
ther the NIT or NCAA tourna-
ments. The program was down,"
struggling to bring in top recruits
and was looking to rebuild.

On  11 "the Panthers en-
tered a game against St. ]ohn’s
with something it never had be-
fore: a No. 1 ranking. The pro-
gram had successfully turned.

But despite,Pitt’s recent suc-
cess, Pitt coach Jamie Dixon is in
an ongoing battle to get top re-
cruits who can help continue that
success.

“The reality is that through all
of this stuf ,” said Dixon, “we’re
still going through the same chal-,
lenges to get kids here.”

And this battle takes place
right, in Pitt’s backyard.

0 “These kids grew up in the
Big East area and want to play in
the Big East,” said Dixon. “They
want to play in front of their fam-
ily and hometown crow .”

Dixon explained that the big-
gest obstacle to overcome in re-
cruiting is location. He said that
as a coach, it’s important to look

for talent within the Big East and

ACC region.

The players, who grew up in
these areas, agreed.

“I was getting recruited by a
lot of the Big East schools,” said
freshman guard Ashton Gibbs.
“You can’t really go wrong going
into the Big East if you’re from
New jersey.”

Gibbs went to high school 20
miles outside of New York City
in West Orange, NJ. He said that
while undecided, he was in com-
munication with Pitt’s coaching
staff on a regular basis —- a com-
mon practice for teams. _

“The coaching staff started
recruiting me my freshman and
sophomore year of high school,”
said Gibbs. “I had a good rela-

SGB grants funding for

. by Simone Cheatham

Campus groups argued about Student
Government Board’s decision to approve
funding to bring a controversial speaker to

“To me, it’s a funding issue,” she added. '

But Jonas Moffat, president of Stu-

Discussion about the
event began when Becca ‘ ,
Lehner, a member of Panthers for Israel,
addressed’ the board and audience in a 10-
minute speech about the group’s thoughts
on how the event and the speaker might en-
courage a revival of anti-Semitism at Pitt.

Lehner said the group felt the need to

to come and hear what he

Students in the audience also addressed
the issues with the event and the implica-
tions that could ensue as a result of the
board’s ultimate decision.

right to express their views
on campus and was happy
that members of both
groups were so passionate
about their beliefs-.

“I think it’s a slippery
slope when we become
subjective on funding for
different student groups,”
said Abbott. “We’ve had

feel that Abunimah per-
sonally affected students

in a negative way. We urge the board to re- H

consider  this.”

Aliyah Furman, a Pitt _student and
former president of Panthers for Israel,
agreed, saying she was concerned not that
the speaker was pro-Palestinian, but that
she worried he would promote anti-Jewish
views. _v
“Saying we don’t want him to come
because he’s Palestinian is absolutely ludi-
crous,” said Furman. “I’m so happy that
[Students for Justice in Palestine] is holding
events and promoting their views. It wasn’t
always like this, but we’re worried "about the

people like Ann Coulter
and other; controversial
speakers on this campus, and I don’t think
it’s up to the board to make funding deci-
sions based on personal views.”

SGB President Kevin Morrison agreed.

“All groups have the right to have
speakers come to the campus to promote
dialogue,” said Morrison. “The decision we
made tonight is the decision of the board

as a whole and does not reflect board mem-

bers’ personal ideas on the matter.”

The event, called “Palestine / Israel_ and
the End of the Two-State Solution with Ali
Abunimah,” will be held in Room 120 of

New garbage cans might look
trashy, but aren't all bad

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s of-

 fice has used $252,500 from state
5 grant money to buy 250 trash cans

at a price of $1,010 apiece. Each
one will carry the slogan “Taking

; Care of Business,” in reference

i to his business-district beautiﬁ-

cation plan of the same name,
along with his name and title on a

 black-and-gold sign, according to

§ the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

Our first question obviously

 must be: Why won’t the signs say

Luke Steelerstahl?

But all kidding aside, the plan
does have its merits. The Tak-
ing Care of Business campaign
does sweeps through different
business districts around the city,

doing things like issuing citations

for properties not up to code, re-
painting road lines and providing
the area with new signs, bike racks
and garbage cans.

The program differs from the

 late Mayor Bob O’Connor’s Redd

Up program in that it only deals

: with business ‘districts, not neigh-

borhoods, not to mention Raven-
stahl’s own program didn’t start
until after O’Connor’s tenure.

So, as a part of the Taking

4 Care of Business program, it’s

difficult to argue with. Providing
garbage cans is a good way to re-
duce litter rates and to make an

5 area look nicer in general.

Perhaps the most stinging part
of the plan is the price tag, with
each garbage can costing taxpay-
ers $1,010. In a Tribune—Review
interview, store owner Marc Ad-
ams said, “Holy mackarel  I
would have put them out there
for $900 apiece.”

But when considering that
these cans will be a serni-perma-

nent part of the area and will

have to withstand years of abuse
from weather and everyday us-
age, it justifies the extra spending.
If the city is going to replace old
trash cans, it’s better that it spend
a little more to buy ones that will
last rather than cheap ones that
will need to be replaced in ﬁve
years. —

And as for Ravenstahl putting
his name on the receptacles, well,
why not? He certainly isn’t the
first U.S. mayor to put his name
on a part of his own project —
previous Pittsburgh mayors have
had their names on trash cans,
buildings and programs for years.

Sure, the timing seems a little
auspicious for Ravenstahl — with
an election coming up in May, it
certainly would be nice to have
250 taxpayer—funded campaign
signs scattered around the city
promoting his name and provid-
ing direct evidence of his pro-
grams restoring the community.

Critics have said that the cans
are a sneaky way for Ravenstahl
to promote himself and that the
taxpayers shouldn’t have to fund
what is basically self—promotion.

‘But Public Works operations

manager Ben Carlise said that
the cans are better quality than
many of the ones on the streets
now, and that the placards bearing
Ravenstahl’s name didn’t cost any
extra money.

So even if they appear to be a
little self—congratulator}g and even
though they might seem expen-
sive, the truth is that this is simply
a mayor  to brand his work
in the city. And if that work is of
a good nature, serves a legitimate
purpose for the community and
doesn’t harm anyone while it’s do-
ing so, why should we complain?

I’ve never taken a course in

mathematics at Pitt, but I know
what two papers plus two exams
adds up to: one long, dreary night at
the library.

Faced with a recent academic
crisis, I ventured to the oh—so—hot
study venue: Club Hillman. The
library was in full  when I ar-
rived. There wasn’t a vacant seat to
be found on the noisy and bustling
first floor — but that didn’t matter.
I had some serious studying ahead
of me, and I knew the upper ﬂoors
would be better suited to fulﬁll my
need for noiselessness.

Pitt’s library caters to all students’
study preferences. For those who
want a nice, quiet study session in
solitude, students can seek out one
of the many islands of desks 
among the labyrinth ‘of books on
the upper ﬂoors. _

Navigating through these silent
rows of books, I came to a real-

ization that I was  through
some sort of graveyard. But there
were no dead bodies here, just dead
books.

Hundreds of books sat shelved
in the row I was walking down. Out
of curiosity, I plucked one from its
resting place. This particular book
happened to be about the explora-
tion of caves of the western United
States. Talk about obscure.

How long had it been since this
book was checked out? Thirteen
years, according to the stamp card
on the inside of the back cover. The
book’s first check-out date: 26,
1960.

Holding this fossil got me think-
ing about the nature of libraries.
Club Hillman was packed, yet I
didn’t see anyone browsing the
aisles of books. Students crowded
the study rooms, computer areas
and sea of tables, but the rows of
books remained lifeless.

Like withering autumn leaves
clinging steadfast to their branches,
I wondered if the seemingly peren-
nial pages of these hundreds of

Libraries lose out to the Internet

untouched books would endure the
test of time.

As students, we tend to pigeon-
hole the library as a place to study.
But have we forgotten what the
original purpose of a library is?

Apparently, I have. I’ve only
checked out two or three books at
most from Hillman so far in my
college career. The library is an in-
stitution designed to lend resources
out for research or recreational
reading. Yet more and more it feels
as if our Hillman is but an over-
sized, ﬁve-tiered study lour1ge. And
yet the student can’t be blamed for
this institutional transformation.
Its conversion is only a sign of the
times.

Over the past few years, ap-
proximately 250,000 books were
borrowed from the library each
year, according to a Hillman Library
ofﬁcial..Despite this current steadi-
ness, however, checkout rates began
to drastically decline around seven
to 10 years ago. Unsurprisingly, this
drop in numbers correlates  the
ubiquity of the Internet

Corporate responsibility not an oxymoron

by Daniel Sotelo
Arizona Daily W/ildcat
(M C T Cam/ma )

MCT Campus -- Most people
would be more than grateful after
being saved from drowning, but
a few Americans would be disap-
pointed that their life preservers
weren’t made of gold.

If that notion seems extraor-
dinary or even inconceivable, then
someone hasn’t been paying much
attention to‘ the TARP (Troubled
Assets Relief Program) bailout or
Recovery and’ Reinvestment Act of
2009.

After various concessions, Con-
gress passed the economic stimu-
lus package last Friday in hopes
of jump-starting the long, arduous
journey toward ﬁnancial recovery.
Unlike the ﬁrst round of the previ-
ous $70O billion bailout of ﬁnancial
institutions, the stimulus package
contains new, staunch regulations
concerning executive compensa-
tion of banks receiving bailout
money.

An amendment inserted by

Chris Dodd, chairman of the Sen-
ate Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing and Urban Affairs, would limit
the compensation of top execu-
tives at any bank receiving bailout
funds, otherwise known as taxpay-
er money. The limits would apply
to bonuses issued to the executives
and place a cap of no more than
one-third of their base salary.

To put the difference between
-this amendment and previous
pracdces in their proper context,
Bank of America CEO Kenneth
Lewis received a base salary of
$1.6 million, but took home a total
compensation of more than $16.4
million. These limits would remain
in place as long as ﬁnancial institu-
tions still maintain taxpayers funds
or until they are repaid.

The news of this stringent
amendment has industry analysts
buzzing about the potential conse-
quences of  executive pay.
Scott Talbott, a representative from
the Financial Services Roundtable,

characterized industry concerns by it
saying, “If the goal of TARP is to

make companies stronger, to get

them back on their feet so they can
stand on their own, and this drives
away key executives, this is a prob-
lem.”
Whﬂe my conﬁdence in Tal-
bott’s concern for the taxpayers
of this country is clear, I ﬁnd his
conclusion to be murky at best.
Talbott’s notion of “key execu-
tives” may be correct, but only if
reworded as “executives that were
key to the economic meltdown.”
Like Talbott, many others have
already decried the destruction of
the corporate incentive system as a
blow to capitalism. Without ridicu-
lously gross bonuses, U.S. corpora-
tions are at risk for losing all those
hotshot executives who worked so
hard to foster and care for our eco-
nomic future. Worse yet, we may
have to resort to highly educated
and responsible executives whose
motivations are ethical treatment
of taxpayer money and fostering a
sustainable approach for economic
recovery and, eventually, growth.
"Other than his concern for the
well-being of the everyday Joe,
what stake do Talbott and Finan-

cial Services Roundtable have in
this matter? As representatives of
the 100 largest ﬁnancial ﬁrms _in
the country, FSR is deeply vested in
the proﬁts and ﬁnancial ﬁlture of
the top players in the industry.

Many free-market enthusiasts
might View this as an abomination
of government intervention into
the sacred realm of the corpo-
rate world. If the last few months
haven’t opened their eyes, then they
may just be glued shut. True to the
last eight years, the former incen-
tive system was a hybtid of ﬁscal
restraint and small government,
 two birds with one stone
and upholding conservative pn'n—
ciples of government.

_ Still not signed into law, the
economic stimulus package pres-
ents more questions than answers.
The objections of industry insiders
like Talbott do contain legitimate
concerns. The ability to make un-
founded sums of money in a single
year is an attractive incentive for
virtually any person. However, the
implication that limiting executive
compensation will result in a mas-

sive corporate exit is clearly moti-
vated by a conflict of interests.

A bank, as a private institution,
has the capacity to award execu-
tives an appropriate compensation
package as they see ﬁt. Banks re-
ceiving taxpayer funds have an ethi-
cal —— and now legal — obligation
to conduct business in a ﬁscally re-
sponsible manner. While there will
forever be opponents of the bail-
out, retroactively condemning the
fall of corporate America and rise
of socialism, the need for ﬁnancial
recovery demands that the billions
of taxpayer dollars be injected into
our economy hand-in-hand with
corporate responsibility.

Once the bailout is signed into
law, there won’t be a sudden wave
of idealism and ethics. Executives
who once took advantage of the
pseudo-free market may try to take
advantage of the misfortune of
others. What is needed most is that
key executive positions in critical
ﬁnancial institutions be ﬁlled with
new blood, professionals who have
goals of long-term ﬁnancial recov-
ery and success.

Club Hillman is more a study

Gillogly, page 6
The Intemet’s web of information
undergoes never-ending expansion
and updating. Granted, users must
screen certain Web sites to ensure
the credibility of their content, but
overall the Internet provides a pow-
erhouse of reliable information su-
petior to even the largest libraries’
collections of printed resources.
And today the library feels syn-
onymous with the old—fashioned.
On several instances I’ve heard ev-
eryone from my professors to my

parents reminisce about the joys of
digging through a stack of books to
look up some obscure statistic or
fact back in their college days. Now,
a quick Google search circumvents
this hassle. Technology is a beauti-
ful thing. a

So where does the library stand
in today’s world? As a tangible hard-
copy of history, the importance of
the book can’t be forgotten. And
the library’s wealth of books will al-

ways serve a niche for the researcher

seeking material that might not be
available online. Then again, Hill-
man is constantly expanding its dig-
ital network of information —— and
I’m certain other libraries are too ——-
meaning more of its resources are
available through the Internet. This
in turn means that credible infor-
mation can be obtained faster and
much more easily.
Not only do we not have to deal
' with the physical process of hunting

down a book — no more straining

center than library

our eyes to read tiny classiﬁcation
numbers on spines of books or
getting lost amid the maze of rows
——- we can browse the library’s col-
lection from our computer screens.

Thus, the library is becoming a
hybrid institution. The books prob-
ably won’t be disappearing from the
shelves anytime soon, as evidenced
by the very old book on spelunking
that I happened upon. But at the
same time, their relevance seems
obsolete to the downpour of digital

data.

It’s not unfortunate that Hill-
man serves more as a study ground
than a book lender, for this doesn’t
necessarily imply students are ne-
glecting research or reading less.
Save the ardent bibliophiles out
there, we should regard the state
of the library as a testament to the
advancement and capability of the
Information Age

Microsoft ﬁnds itself in court over°Vista yet again

by Donald Campbell
Columnidt

It would appear that the e

trend in computer technology is
to question major software com-
pany policies in major‘ system
software licensing.

‘Just last week, Apple Com-

puter, Inc. faced some surprising

threats from court rulings regard-
ing its right to forbid Macintosh
OS X from being loaded on non-
proprietary, non-Apple hardware.

This week, Microsoft is facing
litigation for its licensing policies
toward the Windows XP‘ to Win-
dows Vista transition.- '

Emma Alvarado — a disgrun-
tled buyersof new personal corn-
puters-— brought on the main
problem surrounding the new
lawsuit.

' Alvarado, according to an ar-
ticle recently published by Com-
puterworld.com, became angry

RESEARCH STUDY

  

I DEPRESSED?

Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
are recruiting people ages M to 25 for a‘ medication

research study. "We are seeking people who feel
depressed and smoke marijuana. Participants will receive

when she found_out that her new
PC would have a price increase if
she requested XP to be pre—load-
ed.

In essence, manufacturers like
Dell and Hewlett—Packard be-
gan charging their customers to
“downgrade” factory-assembled
PCs from Microsoft Windows
Vista Home Premium to the pre-
vious Microsoft Windows XP.

Why does Microsoft care,
speciﬁcally? Put most simply, it’s
because Microsoft continually
viewed its Vista operating system
as a failure and an embarrass-
ment. .

Nonetheless, l\/Iicrosoft spent
millions upon millions of dollars
developing the operating system,
and it shivers at the idea of sirn-
ply writing off the operating sys-
tem without attempting to make a
few saless

Microsoft

therefore ‘ an-

nounced that XP’s support would s

end, forcing new PC buyers to
purchaseVista—installed'machines.

an evaluation that includes a physical exam, study

medication, and treatment for three months at no cost.

RIJUANA?

It then pushed back the deadline,
allowing computer manufacturers
to continue to offer PCs to users
withiXP pre-installed. Microsoft
wanted to offset its Vista losses,
‘however, and, as Computerworld.
com reported, came up with a
rather clever —-— some may refer
to it as devious —- method for
forcing users to spend money.
Microsoft mandated that a
license transfer from Vista to

- XP could be made only from a

more premium version of Vista.
Users who "switched to XP on a
new machine could opt onlypfor
the significantly. more expensive
Windows XP Professional.

Computer manufacturers were
therefore required to charge cus-
tomers for the downgrade, as the
downgrade would initially require»
an upgrade. ,

The complete path of a suc-
cessful Dell downgrade would
therefore be Vista .Home Premi-
um to Vista Ultimate and down to
Windows XP Professional. The

  
  

0 S if? H I 2.1.
apug-nhumag

initial upgrade from Vista Home
Premium to Vista Business would
require an investment, as there is
a signiﬁcant price difference be-
tween new licenses of the two
operating system versions.

Customers like Alvarado be-_

came queasy.

If you were to attempt a
purchase of a Dell Inspiron on
Dell’s Web site, a downgrade to
Windows. XP Professional would
add $150 to the price tag. Since
the machine starts at only $270,
the downgrade could account for
more than half of. the purchase
price.

The court argument Alva-
rado created against Microsoft
surrounds the age-old argument
that has plagued Microsoft since
its decision to ship Internet Ex-
plorer with Windows 95.

Alvarado ‘ argues‘ that Mi-
crosoft abused its power as the
majority operating system manu-
facturer to make an undeserved
proﬁt. In other words, Microsoft

is taking part in, as Alvarado’s
case describes, “anticompetitive
and monopolistic” activities.
Shou_ld Microsoft be able to
license‘ its software as it sees fit,

' attempting to force. its customer

base to a new operating system
that it already seemed to abandon
as a failure?

Microsoft has the tendency to
act in anticompetitive ways, and it
can be argued that this previous
behavior should be always held
against it. .

If we wanted to give Micro-
soft the benefit of the doubt, we
could believe its arguments that
Vista is “not that bad,” and that
an upgrade to Vista Home Prerni—
um should be acceptable to most
computer users.

Giving the beneﬁt of the
doubt would also allow us - to
believe that Microsoft is surely
attempting to show the reality

that integral to-change is, well,'

change.

Perhaps even Microsoft sees

Rosewood Thieves is
classically   predictable

_ Rise & Shine

The Rosewood Thieves
Independent

Rocks like} a mellow John Lennon .

 

A by Andy Tybout
For Me Pitt New

The 19605
might be ‘long
gone, but
wouldn’t know
it listening to
The Rosewood
Thieves.

Beginning with

 

its 2006 debut album, From z‘/ye Decker Home,

this New York City. quintet has made a
name for itself as classic-rock revivalists.
Singer Erick Jordan, guitarist Paul Jenkins,
organist Mackenzie Vernacchio, drummer
Mark Bordenet and bassist Jon Estes are
all experts at_ recreating the sharp, clean
sounds of yesteryear.

Rzlre @’ Sbiné, the Thieves’ latest album,
bears an uncanny resemblance to the mu-
sic of the psychedelic era — Erick ]ordan’s

voice is almost indistinguishable from john ‘

Lennon’s. Given the current state of rock
’n’ roll, it’s no surprise that in the latest al-
. burn the Thieves borrow liberally from art-
ists of better days. » ‘
H In this way, Rzlre 2'9’ Shine isn’t much of
a departure from the band’s usual style -—
_steady folk-rock and blues that’s catchy, but
by no means groundbreaking. Throughout

   
  
   
    

a traditional formula — steady—paced, in-
nocent pop music. _
The ﬁrst track, “Silver Gun,” begins
with a deceivingly delicate piano that’s
quickly overtaken by pounding  and
drums. A _
. ‘_‘I didn’t know things weren’t right, /

Jordan cryptically, supported by Beatles-
esque harmonies. Following in the foot-
steps of , “Hello, Goodbye,” Silver Gun
changesits structure at the very end, with
rhythmic claps and shouts of “Bang, bang,
bang, yeah!” ' i

you '

"most of Rise 2'?’ S/Jine, the Thieves stick to‘

‘cause your heart is like a silver gun,” sings’

The second and third tracks, “She Don’t

‘Mind the Rain” and “When My Plane

Lands,” start off almost exactly the same

.way — a high piano riff ‘overtaken by a

grumbling guitar.

This isn’t to say‘ that the Thieves are
without variety;

In “Flat Tire,” a ﬂute is heard ﬂoating
peacefully above a contemplative acoustic

S guitar. In “Fair Lights Flashing,” banjo and

carnival music create a dark, steady pulse
similar to that of “Being For the Beneﬁt
of Mr. Kite.” .
For the most part, however, The Rose-
wood Thieves are not lookingto reinvent
therock ’n’ roll wheel. Songs like “Mad
Mad Blues,’-’ (dark and bluesy, while not
necessarily mad), “Junkyard Julie” (lazy and

forgettable) and “Gone,” (poignant, with a ,

soft slide guitar) all ﬁt well within the realm
of standard ’60s fare. ‘ I i

The album dies quietly with “Heavy
Eyes” _— a seven-minute chill—down track
that’s gradually overtaken by ambient noise,
muchin the same vein as The Velvet Un-
derground’s “Heroin.” It’s a satisfying end
to what is generally a satisfyingalbum.

Rise 2’? Sbine is much like the glass en-
vironments you see at natural history mu-
seums, complete "with thestuffed eittinct
animals and the background landscape
-paintings —- it’s an impeccable recreation
of a lost time. But like the stuffed animals,

 seems to befrozen at spots, unable to

escape its steady, mellow pace. While the
Thieves might have mastered the sounds
of the ’60s, they don’t touch upon the in-‘
ventiveness of its bands. The Thieves are
great for_ taking us back, but they do little
to push us forward. 8 1

It’s always . refreshing to be reminded’
of time when‘ Nickelback didn’t dominate
the rock charts. If you want a.mo_dern—day
band with a yesterday sound, the Thieves}

jare there foryou. _]ustidon’t listen for the

friext bigthing. , _‘

‘Vista, page 9

itself as heroic — gently prodding users to
switch to an operating system that will only’
soon be made obsolete, instead of allowing
them to downgrade to an operating system
that is obsolete already. ,

On the other hand, assuming Microsoft
is an evil software giant bent on making
a proﬁt at all cost — a View _of corporate
America that is quite popular as of late —
would lead a reasonable person to instantly
view Microsoft’s actions as attempting to
force a helpless computer—buying populous
into using a failed operating system that
will quickly be surpassed. i

At any rate, Microsoft probably hopes
that the lawsuits will be silenced by the
acceptance of Windows 7 in the near fu-
ture. If people are ﬁnally willing to leave
the legacy of Windows XP and move to
a new operating system that is not Vista
—_ namely Windows 7. —— the question of
Microsoft’s downgrade-oriented actions is
moot.‘ '

Pitt students should be quite thankful,

ultimately, that they can obtain Windows
XP Professional for free. Downgrading
to.Windows XP Professional is as easy as
stopping by some computer lab to pick up
a CD and sitting for about an hour while a
progress bar slowly moves forward.

tionship with [current assistant
coach] Brandin Knight and that
helped.”

Along with Gibbs, junior
guard Jermaine Dixon said that
he was also recruited by the two
conferences. His decision to
choose Pitt, though, was based
on location and the type of tradi-
tion Pitt is building.

“Other than Maryland, Pitt
was the closest school that I
could go to,” said Dixon, who

i _ grew up in Baltimore. “[Associ—

ate men’s head basketball coach
Tom] Herrion and I started click-
ing early on, and I liked what he
was saying. Pitt seemed like a
good choice.”

After high school, Dixon
played basketball at Tallahassee
Community College in Florida.
He said he began receiving phone

calls from the °Pitt coaching staff
in January 2008.

And a month later he found
himself committing to the Pan-
thers. g

“I liked what [Coach Dixon]
was saying, and I like the program
he was putting together,” he said.

As a younger coach, Dixon
said his involvement with recruits
is higher than other coaches in
college basketball. And although
he said he didn’t change too much
with recruiting when he became
head coach, he is always trying to
keep up with the process. A

“It’s changed so much,” he
said. “It used be about home and
campus visits, but those things
are almost non—existent anymore.
The kids commit before those
things can even get done.”

. Trying to watch Gilbert Brown
for an entire series isn’t easy.

3‘ Take your eyes off the soph-
omore swingman for a second
while he’s in the corner behind
the 3-point line, and next thing
you know he’s soaring toward the
rim as the recipient of an alley-

score, especially with center De-
Juan Blair putting up double-dou-

’ bles nightly, Levance Fields dish-
"zing out non-stop assists, and Sam

Young ﬁnishing out his career as
one of Pitt’s all-time best scorers.

What Brown brings off the
bench isn’t solely based on stats.

M Heading into Pitt’s game against

"Cincinnati over the weekend,
Brown had a few underwhelm-
ing, inconsistent performances

in a row. His performance during
Pitt’s win against- No. 1—ranked
Connecticut on Monday night
was the same way.

But Brown is starting to now
learn that it’s not always his job
to score, it’s his job simply to do
what the team needs him to do on
any given night. 1

ute and do what I can.

“After having a couple of
games not go so well for me, I
was just thinking about staying
positive and trying to contribute
and do what I can,” said Brown.

On Saturday against Cincin-
nati, those contributions came
with points.

About midway through the
first half of that game, Cincin-
nati trailed by two points. Brown
helped Pitt’s lead increase by
slamming home two dunks and
converting a 3-point play in a
span of minutes to give the Pan-
thers a nine point lead.

The Bearcats managed to
hang around well into the second

‘half, slowly creeping back into the

game by cutting a doub1e—digit
lead down to just ﬁve with about
12:30 to go.

Fields was dribbling around at
the top of «»the key when Brown
dashed towardthe hoop from the
corner. A perfectly lobbed pass
from Fields resulted in another
Brown slam, not only waking up

-the crowd, but the Panthers as

well. Pitt went on to score nine
straight points after the alley-

For the Pitt women’s ten-

while.‘

The Panthers are off to their
first 5-0 start since 1992 after a
pair of home wins against Seton
Hall and St. Bonaventure over the
weekend.  '

“This is one of the best teams
I’ve ever ha ,” said Pitt Coach
George Dieffenbach, whois in his
28th season with Pitt.

Elizabeth Adams is one of the
reasons why. _

four of her matches over the week-
end, making her 10-O on the year.

sue of proximity for recruits, the college
must follow strict NCAA regulations. If a
school violates current recruiting policies,
it faces punishment that ranges from losses
in scholarship money to banishment from
the NCAA Tournament.

Currently, the NCAA regulations allow
colleges to make only one phone call per
month during a recruit’s sophomore and
junior year of high school. During a play-
er’s senior year, programs can contact the
recruit no more than twice a week. That’s
just one of the hundreds of rules that can
cause problems- for any coach or program.

But while all schools have to deal with
the rules, certain programs get a head start
because of their history and tradition.

That’s how it is for the Duke Blue Dev-
ils.

“Recruits have seen

of the Pitt tradition over the past eight
years. Jermaine Dixon, who has earned a

starting job this season, believes that as Pitt 

stays at the top of college basketball, the
top recruits will start playing for the Pan-

. thers.

“Coach Dixon did a good job of pick-

ing up players that are not at the top of the ‘*’*

recruiting class, but still good players,” said
Dixon. “I’m pretty sure they’ll start going
after the high-ranking players and they’ll
start getting them to come here.”

Most of the starred rankings come
from two primary Web sites that cover col-
lege basketball: Rivals.com and Scout.com.
These sites evaluate a prospect’s skills,
speed, strength and other characteristics to
give the recruit a ranking of -1-5.

But, as a coach, Dixon said there is more

season, the Blue Devils

have been coached by what Bradley calls
a “household name,” in Mike Krzyzews-
ki — or just Coach K. And when Duke
reached the No. 1 spot in the AP poll this
year, Krzyzewski became the only coach in
NCAA history to take his team to the top-
ranked spot 13 times.

Bradley said that it could take time for a
program to develop into a perennial power-
house. But when it does develop, a school’s
tradition is an important piece for recruits
when they’re deciding between Schools. B

“I think if you asked Duke players past
and present why they chose Duke, they
would say Coach K,” said Bradley.

Pitt, as well as Duke, works early with
recruits to establish a good relationship
with the players. The coaching staff uses
phone calls and e—mails as well as official
and unofficial visits to get recruits to come
to Pitt.

This year, that constant attention to
recruiting helped the Panthers reach the
No.1 spot for the first time in school his-
tory. It’s something that has catapulted the
team into the spotlight as a national cham-
pion contender. V

For the players, they’re happy to be part

“Those are important
backgrounds that get left out.”
Still, the Panthers are beginning to see
the signs of success within the ranking sys-
tem.

In 2007, Pitt signed Brad Wanamaker

and Dejuan Blair — both highly touted '

out of high school. Blair was a four-star re-
cruit according to Rivals.com, while Scout.
com had him ranked as a ﬁve—star. Blair

if has emerged as one of the faces of the Pitt

program.’

Wanamaker, a four-star recruit accord-
ing to both recruiting services, has been an
integral part of Pitt’s bench this season.

This year, the Panthers received a com-
mitment from forward Dante Taylor —- a
ﬁve-star recruit from Maryland. Taylor is
rated as one of Pitt’s best recruits in his-
tory. P

Asithe coach who is doing much of

V the recruiting himself, Dixon said that in»

recent years, a lot of players are starting to
buy into his system and see a great oppor-
tunity at Pitt.

“We're starting to get the best kids and
the best players, and our record speaks to
that,” said Dixon. ‘‘‘It’s a” story that writes
itself.”

which it would not relinquish.
“I was trying to be more assertive and

insert myself into the game where I could,”

said Brown.

He ended the game playing 17 minutes
and scoring 12 points — his second highest
total of the year and his highest in a Big
East game. He added two rebounds and an
assist for good measure.

“He stepped up,” said Blair. “He gave

. us a spark off the bench.”

On Monday night, things were different
for Brown. In fact, he didn’t score a single
point. In 25 minutes, he missed all ﬁve
shots he took. But he helped the Panthers
pull off the upset in other ways.

Brown hauled in a season—high seven
rebounds — three of which were on the of-
fensive end. He also played strong defense,

tallied two assists and added a steal. Box
scores can be misleading: Brown’s ability
to contribute in a variety of ways is one
reason the Panthers are playing their best
basketball of the year looking toward the
postseason.

Brown is averaging 19.3 minutes a game
this year, the most by any non-starter. And
while he’s only a sophomore, he has plenty
of experience. He started 15 games last

year after an injury to Mike Cook. And it’s
not that he’s incapable of putting up big
numbers or jumping through the roof. In a
game last month against South Florida, the
Bulls were late getting to the Pete because
of weather, so Brown, along with Young,
entertained the crowd with a mini slam
dunk contest. Heading into next season,
he figures to be an integral part of the Pitt
offense. '

But what Brown is doing best this sea-
son most likely won’t have you doing a
double-take when reading a box score. He
will, though, help Pitt in whatever way it
needs him to. And for now, that’s all Pitt
needs.
