Two fraternity pledges Iaeaien

Kappa Alpha Psi suspended
indefinitely For hazing incident

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Five suspects were arrested over the weekend ‘for a beating that put
two Pitt fraternity pledges in the hospital.

On Thursday, Pitt Police apprehended current Pitt student Timothy
Jones and four other suspects who have all been Pitt students at one
time.

Pitt students Byron Woodson, 18, and Santana Kenner 20, were
pledges at Kappa Alpha Psi and were visiting the house on Joncaire
Street in South Oakland on March 29, when Pitt oﬂicials said the haz-
ing occurred.

Woodson and Kenner entered the fraternity house, where at least ﬁve
individuals beat them with wooden paddles, causing damage to their

kidneys. Both students were taken to local hospitals and treated for their ‘

injuries.
Pitt spokesperson Ken Service said the fraternity was suspended

pending a further investigation as soon as Pitt learned of the assault last .

Monday.

The non—Pitt students who were arrested — Eric Coﬁled of Penn
Hills, Iman Jones of Robinson Township, Daymon Williams of
Oakland and Milton Robinson of Philadelphia ———- were arraigned along
with Timothy Jones Thursday night. The five suspects were charged
with two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of recklessly endan-
gering another person and one count of criminal conspiracy.

They posted bond and have an upcoming trial in Allegheny County
Common Pleas Court

Iman Jones is a recent Pitt graduate, and Service said Cofiled,
Wﬂliarns and Robinson have been Pitt students at various times.

Kappa Alpha Psi is the third Pitt fratemity to be suspended since
December. In January, Sigma Phi Epsilon was suspended by Pitt and its
national office for a hazing incident involving underage drinkers. And
last December Zeta Beta Tau was permanently kicked out of Pitt when
three of their brothers were arrested for taking pictures of naked women
in Towers shower stalls.

Student groups gather For a unified campus

Student groups came together as one on
Saturday at the first annual Rally For Unity.

Despite cold weather and snow, the rally
took place on the patio outside of the Student
Union. It was a time for all interested groups
on campus to get together in the same place, 
exchange ideas and hopefully help each other

out.

This was not only a day of sharing, it was
also a day of music and good times. Local

their time and talent to the event. There were
also poetry readings and speeches from the

Several student groups were instrumental in
the planning of this event, including: the
Campus Women’s Organization, Black Action
Society, the Spanish and French clubs,
BiGaLA, University Democrats, Hillel and the Student

Government Board.

However, this wasn’t a university mandated event.

Mande|a's daughter tells of struggles in S. Africa

By Julie D. Hannon
Asst. News Editor

As part of a national tour of histori-
cally black colleges and universities,
Dr. Makaziwe Mandela, the daughter
of South African President Nelson
Mandela, spoke about the state of the
new South Africa in the lower lounge
of the William Pitt Union on
Thursday.

A crowd of about 60 attentively lis-
tened as Mandela, a distinguished
Fulbright Fellow and University of
Witwatersrand administrator, began
by paying tribute to the great accom-
plishments achieved by her father, a
leader, she said, who is unique in his
time.

“Even after being released from
jail, he fought for the liberation of
blacks. Now that he has been elected,
he wants to build a new vision of a
united South Africa. Right now we
are in that transition,” said Mandela.
“And we believe whether or not we
succeed depends on South Africans
—— both black and white.”

But Mandela also cautioned that
while her father is key to the transi-
tion, he alone cannot be the solution.

“Many believe that Nelson Mandela
has miraculous powers,” she said.
“But 350 years of oppression cannot
be wiped out overnight. And it can-
not be the work of one man.”

She also believes that it is impor-
tant for South Africans to continue to

be honest with themselves and with
outsiders, realizing that the road to
equality will be long and difficult.
She said they must admit they’re
struggling and that the journey is far
from over.

“The legacy of the past is with us.
and it has deep roots,” said Mandela,
who received both her master’s and
doctorate degrees at the University of
Massachusetts. “We know we have
come a long way, but we, also realize
our transition is not complete. I think
we have made great strides, but the
ending of the apartheid regime is not
an end to racism and prejudice _——- it
is not that easy.”

One major point of concern, said

BEIJING -— In a reversal of
its hard-line rhetoric, China
has solicited suggestions from
the people of Hong Kong on
ways to ease the colony’s tran-
sition from British to Chinese
rule next year.

Apparently worried by the
prospect of a huge exodus and
flight of capital from the
booming financial center,
Beijing took the unprecedent-
ed step of taking out full-page
advertisements in the Hong
Kong media inviting the pub-
lie to voice opinions to the
Chinese government.

It was the first sign that
China is reassessing its,con—
frontational policies on Hong
Kong and in the Taiwan Strait.
Chinese authorities also
sought greater cooperation
from the British colonial gov-
ernment on administrative
issues vital to the takeover.

But reaction in Hong Kong,
as it has been in Taiwan, was
far from accommodating.
Government leaders and
teachers’ union members have

, been among the most outspo-

ken in pledging not to abide by
any conditions set by ruling
bodies selected in Beijing.

Mumia Abu-Jama|'s attorney decries death penalty

Famed lawyer
speaks at Pitt

By Nicole Wilson
Staff Writer

An eye for an eye? Some
Americans view capital punishment
as justifiable compensation for mur-
der. But others, like renowned attor-
ney Leonard Weinglass, view it as
an unfair and unreasonable answer
to crime.

“I draw the line at the death
penalty,” he said.

years of active defense in civil lib-
erties-cases, both national and inter-
national. He currently acts as chief

According to

“Life, Death,

result of a

Justice, and the Mumia Abu-Jamal
Case.”

“We permit states, through the
name of state power, to take lives,”
Weinglass said.

He argued that states that impose

“terribly flawed” system.

“In many of these cases, the per-
sons who face death are innocent,”
he said.

Weinglass also said that many
death sentences are the result of dis-

honesty and racial bias in court.
Such wasithe case, he said, in the
sentencing of Mumia Abu-Jamal.

In 1982, Jamal was convicted for
the shooting death of a Philadelphia
police officer. Weinglass said that
Jamal’s involvement in such minori-
ty activist groups as the Black
Panther party caused the case to be
“racially tainted.”

Weinglass said he believes that
the U.S. justice system is primitive
compared to those of other coun-
tries.

“There is a societal need to bring
perpetrators of violence to justice;
there is no question about it.” But,
he said, the United States needs to
re-evaluate the effectiveness of cap-
ital punishment.

“The imposition of death cannot
make an impact on murder,” he said.

In the field of library sci-

Citation is comparable to
the Nobel Prize. This year’s
winner is Pitt’s own Arlene
Taylor, an associate profes-
sor in the Department of
Science.

The award represents out-.

standing professional
achievement in cataloguing
and classification in librari-
anship.

According Toni Carbo
Bearman, dean of Pitt’s
School of Library and
Information Science, Taylor
has strengthened and revi-
talized the department since
she started there in 1993. -

“She has taken a leader-
ship role in the redesign of
our core curriculum,”
Bearman said. Taylor has
been responsible for keep-

and more advanced informa-
tion.

Taylor was chosen from
among other contenders
across the country.

“It’s a really good feeling
to be recognized,” said
Taylor, who's been working
in library science for nearly
25 years and has published
six books as well as numer-
ous articles.

Along with the award,
Taylor will receive $2,000
to donate to the school of
her choice. Taylor chose
Pitt’s Department of Library

She said she hopes the
money will be able to help
students who are interested
in library science and will
make it easier for them to

Leading chimpanzee expert stresses conservation

By Ben Jackson
For The Pitt News

In the last event of this year’s
Carnegie Lecture Series, Dr. Jane
Goodall spoke last Monday night about
her work with chimpanzees in Africa
and how that work related to human
society.

Goodall is best known for her study
of chimpanzee families, which
National Geographic magazine has

' brought to the world. Having worked

with the chimpanzee populations in
northern Tanzania for 35 years,
Goodall now spends most of her time
on the lecture and fund—raising circuits,
trying to spread a message of conserva-
tion and raise money to protect the
chimpanzees in their natural environ-
ment.

Goodall opened by sharing the
lessons of her childhood and how she,
a student who loved animals but
couldn’t afford to go to a university,
became the world’s leading expert on
chimpanzees. She said that her mother,
now 92, is her primary source of inspi-
ration. “My mother’s message to me,
which I’ve been trying toshare with

young people all over the world was:
‘Jane, if you really want something and
work hard enough and take advantage
of every opportunity, you can do what-
ever you want, but the way is not
always straight.”’

As she went on to share her learning
experiences,

panzees and human beings. For
instance, there are good mothers and
bad mothers, and early childhood expe-
riences affect both humans and chim-
panzees later in life. Goodall posited
that understanding chimpanzees would
be useful for understanding human
society. Not

larities, like the fact that all contagious
human diseases can also infect chimps
and that the chimpanzee is the closest
relative to humans in the animal king-
dom.

She also brought out the similarities
between the social behaviors of chim-

practices of humans who threaten the
chimps. For example, she said that the
chimps are hunted for meat and for the
live-animal trade. Mother chimps are
shot so that the babies can be collected
and sold either for research or show
business. She described the practices of

show business trainers who train
chimps by hitting them over the head
with an iron bar. According to Goodall,
Clint Eastwood’s famous orangutan
sidekick from the “Any Which Way
But Loose” died from a fractured skull
inflicted by his trainer.

Although the body of her lecture was
comprised of a slide show and discus-
sion of her work with the chimpanzees
in Gombe, Africa, human society —-
and young people especially -— were
the real focus of her talk. She said that
hope for the future lies with young
people. The final portion of Goodall’s

lecture was devoted to the problems .

that the world is facing today. She said
that she has been approached by many
experts who cite studies and statistics
that say humans are on a ship “which is
headed straight for the rocks, and no
matter how hard we all pull on the
wheel. we can’t change our course."
Goodall listed the problems of pollu-
tion, overpopulation, crime and war-
fare as those which cause human
beings so much trouble. She believes
that the next threat humans will be
forced to contend with is disease. She
noted that drug-resistant bacteria and

viruses like HIV and Ebola are

impending problems for society.

Goodall is optimistic, however.
“Humans are problem solving
creatures. We’ve begun to real-
ize, ordinary people around the
world have begun to realize, that
there are problems to be
solved.”

She’s been working with stu-
dents around the world to make
them more environmentally con-
scious, and she listed young
people as one of the greatest
resources for the future. She
pointed to their energy and ﬂexi-
bility as the traits which allow
them to make a difference. They
are already thinking in terms of
the environment and trying to
make a difference. °

Before giving her lecture, she

met with a group of Schenley ’

High School students and started
a chapter of her Roots and
Shoots program, which is
designed to get more young peo-
ple thinking about environmen-
tal issues.

At the close, she brought out
four symbols of hope, which she
said showed that mankind’s
future is not so bleak. The first
was a piece of the Berlin Wall,
which she said her generation
thought would never come
down. The second was a leaf
from a tree that survived the
atomic bomb blast at Nagasaki.
The third was a cartridge from a
gun found on a sanctuary for
chimpanzees, which was was
originally a military training
base and had been converted for
peaceful use. The last was a toy
monkey given to her by a magi-
cian who had been blinded
while in the Marine Corps and
had learned magic, scuba diving,
Japanese swordsmanship and
skydiving since he lost his sight.
This, Goodall said, was an
example of the indomitability of
the human spirit.

“As I travel around the world, I
constantly meet remarkable peo-
ple,” said Goodall. “It continual-
ly renews my faith in the human
spirit and the power of the indi-
vidual to make a difference.”

I spent a few minutes trying
to decipher Ringaskiddy on a
framed map of County Cork
that hung on the wall, but it
was so old that the letters, if
they were all there, appeared
blurry. I browsed through the
titles of books that rested hori-
zontally on the bookshelves
and had to chuckle when I saw
a book about Nancy Reagan. It
just didn’t suit the atmosphere.

At the far end of the third
and final room, which was a
classy rendition of the inside
of a barn, loft included, four
musicians set up their instru-
ments to begin playing their
own variety of traditional Irish
tunes, which has been a rule of
thumb every Thursday night
for the past 10 years.

At the opposite end of the
room there were four wooden
tables, each equipped with
four chairs. I sat down at one
and suddenly became intimi-
dated by what I saw. The
dance floor was bigger than I
expected, and I started getting
nervous (like the first time I
hit a golf ball with my genius
instructor watching my every
move) that all those women
(who don’t have a drop of
blood in them that isn’t Irish)

Mandela

°Frjompage1
Mandela, was the social
-and economic impact

apartheid has had on the
blacks in South Africa. She
said that it’s time for the
blacks to play “catch—up”
in terms of education and
employment and that the
process will take some
adjustment, not only on the
parts of the whites, but of
the blacks as well.
According to Mandela,
there are 30 million blacks
in South Africa, as com-
pared to the five million

whites, yet 95 percent of

thoseholding executive
positions are white, and of
the 24,000 doctors in the
country, only 1,002 are
black.

“There is no doubt that
the history of the division
between blacks and whites
is long andpowerful. I
firmly believe that without
healing those wounds, we
cannot have a full recov-
ery.”

To move-forward, she
insisted, South Africans
must not separate reconcil-
iation and transformation,
but instead, must speak of
the two in the same breath,
because “they are two sides
of the same coin.”

Mandela also stressed
that in order for the move-
ment to be successful, it
will take more than the will
of the people. She said the
state must also intervene
and take an active role.

“The state can’t wait for
the change to happen on its

own,” said Mandela.
“There must be state inter-
vention. We, as South

Africans, need the govern-
ment to intervene and cre-
ate opportunities for black
South Africans. We don’t
want them to discriminate
against another class, but
instead, create opportuni-
ties for those who in the
past have not received that
chance.”

Again, she stressed the
importance of a united
fight, including the whites,
blacks, the rich and the
poor to struggle as one
country. She said that those
who make it, who climb
the ladder, must also not
forgot where they came
from if the battle for a
democratic society is to be
a reality.

“That’s why we have ll
official languages,” she
said. “All 11 have the same
status, and it is up to the
people to learn and respect
one another’s language.” ,

Finally, with confidence
in her voice, she spoke of
the future of her homeland
without her father’s guid-
ance.

“There are ‘many other
black leaders who have
fought hard and who I
know are dedicated to a
united South Africa,” said
Mandela. “And in 1999,
when Nelson t Mandela
steps down as president,
there are leaders who will
continue to carry us for-
ward. This must and will
be a continuing process.”

dent groups.

“The CWO came up with

ings, but all of the groups

Kaplan said, “There’s

Opinions

Be all you can be

One United States Circuit Court apparently neglected to read the
Constitution last week, since it decided (9-4) that the military’s homo-
sexual “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy was valid.

Instead of basing its employment policies on capability or even, just
maybe, quality of performance, the military has deemed that certain
people (based on lifestyles not effecting their careers) are not suitable
to serve their country. This is utterly ridiculous.

There used to be a time when women were not allowed to serve in
the military; they still aren’t allowed in some military job categories.
Blacks weren’t allowed to serve in desegregated units until fairly recent
wars. Discrimination against those groups has been (mostly) eliminat-
ed in military enlistment. But discrimination against homosexuals in
the military is a time-honored tradition, and this time the courts are
backing it.

Whether you believe that homosexuality is a biologically determined
fact or a personal choice doesn’t really matter. Either way, a person is
still homosexual; and either way, there is no physical defect which
automatically prevents faithful and effective service in the military.

President Clinton’s much-lauded “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy,
though a step in the right direction, still leaves room for any homosexu-
al to be kicked out of the military. Whether that person blatantly states
his or her homosexuality or accidentally slips “out of the closet” for a
second shouldn’t matter either. The military, by requiring homosexuals
to maintain secrecy, has committed a gross violation of the freedom of
speech. If a person wants to stand on top of a hillside and armounce
his/her homosexuality, it shouldn’t matter, so long as the armounce-
ment does not take place when that person is supposed to be on duty.

“Don’t ask, don’t tell’’ is based on the premise that some people
would be uncomfortable serving in a unit with a homosexual. The
question is, who’s problem is that? Of course, the rnilitary’s purpose is
not to instruct its soldiers in sensitivity or political rhetoric. But if a sol-
dier has a problem serving next to a homosexual, it’s that soldier’s
problem. If there were a confrontation or assault against a gay soldier,
legal action should be taken in a court-marshal.

Homosexuals have been serving in the military for hundreds of
years, at times holding very high-ranking oﬂices. If youare in the mili-
tary now, there-is a strong possibility that one of the people in your unit
is gay — you might never know. But if that person is performing his or
her job well, it shouldn’t make a difference.

If you found out ‘tomorrow that soldier X (who is well-decorated for
meritorious service) was gay, that fact wouldn’t change X’s past
record. And if you develop a personal hatred for X, it is only based on
your own ignorance. X would still do the same job he or she had done
in the past V

As long as a soldier can effectively do the job he or she was hired to
do, it should not matter if that soldier is gay, lesbian, straight, androgy-
nous or anything else. I

The end should come,

I was discussing affirmative
action with my father one day,
and he relayed to me an interest-
ing piece of information. He said
that he had heard on the radio that
both whites and minorities had
the same fears about this issue.
Whites feared that, under aﬁ'1rma-
tive action, less qualiﬁed people
would get jobs because of the
color of their skin. On the same
token, minorities feared that,
without affirmative action, less
qualified people would get jobs
because of the color of their skin.

A recent USA Today opinion
piece used an argument similar to
the latter. The paper said that
because predominantly white
administrators and inﬂuential
alumni can use their power to
admit under-qualiﬁed people of
their choosing, it is hypocritical
for these same people to complain
that afﬁnnative action rriight pro-
duce the same result.

The problem with this type of
reasoning is that there is a vast
difference between the natural
unfairness which exists in the
world and government legislated
unfaimess. While this may seem
to be a picky point, I believe it is
important. With the state of race
relations in this country, we need
as little resentment between peo-
ple as possible; government spon-
sored unfairness is sure to create
more. I would bet that the majori-
ty of people in Edgewood and
Swissvale are now a little less
sympathetic to the poor than they
were before the HUD plan came

to li ht
T e inspiration for both this

article and the USA Today writing
was a recent decision involving
the University of Texas’s admis-
sions program. Under this univer-
sity’s system, blacks and
Mexicans were admitted to law
school over more qualiﬁed appli-
cants because of race.
Applications were even color
coded by race. Several people
who were qualified but rejected
filed suit and won in court. One of

ason
urtis
these, women, Cheryl Hopwood,
worked 20 hours per week to put
herself through college, had a 3.8
grade point average, worked in
Big Sisters and was a C.P.A. She
was also married to a member of
the armed services and had a
handicapped child. This woman’s
life demonstrates exactly the kind
of diversity of experience which
is sought in higher learning, yet
she was rejected because of a pol-
icy aimed at achieving greater
diversity.

I believe that setting quotas to
achieve diversity is a very danger-
ous idea for two reasons. One is
that, as the Supreme Court has
stated, “racial preferences foster

racial stereotyping, engender.

racial politics and hostility, and
perpetuate competition based on
race.” Another problem is that
everyone has some unique and
diverse life experience which can
be valuable to the university com-
munity. How does one determine
which diversity to place‘ the
emphasis upon? Can an upper-
rriiddle class black woman neces-
sarily contribute more to diversity
than a white male from a poor
neighborhood? Taken from
another viewpoint, isn’t a person
with very limited life experience
the one who would need college
the most?

Another problem with affirma-
tive action in general is that it
makes people doubt the qualiﬁca-
tions of minorities with whom
they work. To give a personal
example, I am a great admirer of
former Surgeon General Elders. I
believe she took very important
stands on very controversial
issues and, had she been appoint-
ed by Reagan or Bush. I would
have httle doubt that she was the
most qualiﬁed person for the job.
However, she was appointed by
Clinton as part of his plan to
make his cabinet look like

but when?

America. It makes you wonder,
doesn’tit?

I can, however, see the point of
affirmative action supporters.
Racial injustices do occur. How
can minorities be expected to ele-
vate their status without an oppor-
tunity to prove their worth? For
this reason I feel that afﬁrrnative
action was necessary, and may
still be necessary. The problem is
that no definite goal has been set.
The opponents of the policy want
to end it as soon as possible. The
proponents of the policy want it to
continue for as long as possible.
The solution is for both sides to
agree on some ﬁgure which will
mark the end of affirmative
action. I really have no idea what
this ﬁgure might be, but this is a
very tough issue and no one has
really brilliant answers.

Let’s just say that, hypothetical-
ly, this ﬁgure is that the non-white
population must control 20% of
America’s wealth. When this goal“
is achieved, affirmative action
will end. This hypothetical ﬁgure
(I’ll let people who are much
more informed than me work out
the exact number) should be great
enough to provide a point where
minorities can sink or swim on
their own merits. My goal in
proposing this solution is to allow
people on both sides of the issue
to work together instead of engag-
ing in one of those “You owe us
because we were slaves- But I
never owned slaves” arguments.
It also allows people to work
toward a goal which is both
mutually acceptable and beneﬁ-
cial to the nation.

Aﬁrmative action should end.
Maybe it should have ended yes-
terday. Maybe it should end 10
years from now. I only hope that
when it does end, we will be a
more prosperous and united
nation than when it began.

The Pitt News, Monday, April 8, 1996‘

Republicans send their help to China and Tawian

Just a few short weeks ago,

. the Chinese 9 government

attempted to influence the
Taiwanese election for presi-
dent by staging a massive mil-
itary exercise in the Taiwan
Straits in an effort to intimi-
date voters. The United States
promptly, and properly,
moved naval forces into the
area to protect Taiwan. With
the election over and Chinese
forces withdrawing, tensions
between the U.S. and China
now seem to be simmering
down. Unfortunately, the
American political establish-
ment has decided to label
China as the next great super-
power and America’s next
rival. Both of these pieces of
conventional wisdom are

‘ wholly incorrect.

When American combat

, forces began patrolling the

Taiwan Strait and tensions
began to rise, the Republican-
controlled Congress foolishly
decided to pass an ill-consid-

ered resolution urging the

United States to go to war
with China to protect Taiwan
in the event of an attack. Why
would the GOP do something
so foolishly provocative?

The reason is that with little
work accomplished on its
vaunted Contract With

As an immigrant to this
country, your March 25 col-
umn in The Pitt News call-
ing immigrants “parasites”
is very insulting and

demeaning to all who have‘

come to this country seeking
a better life. Let’s not forget
one thing: everybody came
to this country as an immi-
grant. You may feel like an
American because you were
born here, but your ances-
tors were immigrants, com-
ing to this great land of ours
for the same reason people
continue to come: the
opportunity at a better life.
So, before you begin to
slander immigrants as a
whole, you should remem-
ber that you are a product of
them.

(Editor's note: The Pitt
News would like to apolo-
gize for the offensive com-
ment referred to in this let-
ter. The line was the opinion
of one columnist, not The
Pitt News, its staﬁ or edito-
rial board.)

We are writing in regard to
the article written about the
gymnastics _team in the
April 3rd issue. Besides
printing inaccurate informa-
tion and ignoring scores and
places, The Pitt News false-
ly portrayed the gymnastics
team’s performance at
EAGLs as disastrous. Yes,
we made some mistakes, but
there were many individual

America and its approval rat-
ings in a tail-spin as the
American public becomes
increasingly disillusioned over
its inept handling of the gov-
ernment, the GOP in Congress
is in desperate need of a victo-
ry, and the situation in Taiwan
presented an opportunity too
good to be ignored and not
one soon to be forgotten.

Later this year, Congress
will be reviewing China’s
Most Favored Nation trading
status, and the Republicans
have already promised to give
President Clinton and his non-
confrontational China policy
a firm raking through the
coals. “We’ve got ‘cm by the
b-——s,” one GOP staffer gloat-
ed, looking forward to the
opportunity to do some grand-
standing.

If the GOP was attempting
to exacerbate an already tense
situation in order to collect
some political points, it suc-
ceeded in its goal admirably.
Sadly, the Republican foreign
policy apparatus is eager for a
confrontation with China in
order to boost its poll num-
bers. The GOP’s callous disre-
gard for the consequences of

its actions is unsettling.

Fortunately, cooler heads pre-
vailed, and the recent crisis

performances that deserved
to be recognized.

Brenda Stevens hit all of
her routines, scored a career
high 38.575 and did not fall
from the beam as was print-
ed. Robyn Senior led the
team on vault with 9.75.
And Mikie Myers hit her
routines including a 9.75 on
beam, the third highest
score given on the event.

While the vault squad
broke the Pitt record at
EAGLs, you all chose to
focus on Erika Flamer’s
overrotated second vault,
though she hit her first
(9.7), which counts toward
the team score.

Brenda, Robyn, Erika and
Mikie also earned spots on
various EAGL all-league
teams.

In short, we are tired of
our accomplishments being
overlooked while our mis-
takes become headlines.
This year the positives have
outnumbered the negatives,
although you wouldn't know
that from the articles writ-
ten. At EAGLs, five falls
were counted, not an out-
standing performance, but
not a disaster one either (as
was portrayed). Our team
earned a 189.15, a top-ten
score.

We would also like to
comment on the quote given
by a Maryland gymnast,
“They have no will under
pressure.” NOBODY other
than those on our team
knows what kind of will we

has been defused, but what of
the next time?

Is China as big of a threat to
the security of Taiwan and to
America’s prestige in the
Pacific as the Republican for-
eign policy machine would
have you believe? Certainly
not. At this time, China lacks
(and will likely never have)
the ability to seriously contest
the United States for military
supremacy in the Pacific. The
Chinese military budget is
about $36 billion a year, com-
pared with the $271 billion
that the U.S. Defense
Department is allocated each
year.

While the Chinese might
have a formidable force on
paper, the reality is that their
weapons are outdated. The
Chinese navy is composed of
50 obsolete World War II
destroyers and frigates and 44
old submarines that are no
match for the 200 warships
that make up the U.S.’s
Seventh Fleet. Our sophisti-
cated Ticonderoga-class cruis-

Recently, I have noticed a
rather alarming trend among
my fellow school chums.
Everywhere I go now, I see
buttons, shirts and decora-
tive bumper stickers bearing
the slogan “Against Animal
Testing.” -

Have we really come to
this?

Now, don’t get me wrong,
I’m glad that students have
started taking a stand on
issues that are important to
them. I commend them for
it. But why do we have this
sudden fear of testing ani-
mals?

Let’s face.it, standardized
testing would help us relate
better to our various mam-
mal and maybe even
amphibian friends. My dog,
Snookums (who died three
years ago), was quite smart.
He always knew when cer-
tain TV shows would be on
and could even do a little
dance to various songs that
he recognized (mostly
Wilson Philips). In fact, he
was.so smart, I think that if
he took the SATs, he would
probably have done better
than some students here! At
least on the quantitative sec-
tion.

I understand our intimida-

Chinese counterparts. The
Chinese air force is made up
of third-rate jet fighters.
According to one military
expert on China, “China’s
military is 20 to 30 years
behind the U.S. There is no
sign that they are making the
leapfrogs or the breakthroughs
in their own military R and D
that would enable them to
catch up.”

While the Chinese may
indeed have a massive army
of three million soldiers, in
order to invade Taiwan they
must contend with the prob-
lem of the Taiwan Strait.
Since the Chinese lack the
ability to launch an airmobile
assault against Taiwan and
any invasion fleet would be
blown out of the water by the
U.S. Navy, theChinese are
badly outgunned and lack the
ability to invade Taiwan now
or in the future. “It’s a task in
some ways greater than our
D-Day invasion,” wisely
noted Secretary of Defense
William Perry.

What could the Chinese
attempt to do? Very little.
They could shoot their sur-
face-to-surface missiles at
Taiwanese cities (a threat that
can easily be thwarted by
placing Patriot missiles in

tion about animals being
intelligent. I think this all
has to do with the talking
pig movie, “Babe” (and, to a
lesser extent “Gordy”).
Sure, those animals were
smart, but are we really
afraid that they could prove
to be smarter than us? I
don’t think so. It was only a
movie! And if animals could
talk, all they would proba-
blytalk about is politics,
like in the boring book
Animal Farm.

So I say, let’s give our
creatures a chance.

In your April 4 editorial,
you stated that unless City
Council President Jim Ferlo
was “careful about how to
deal with Pitt  then maybe
the City Council President
will change names.”

What a crock. The idea
that Pitt undergrads could be
motivated to get up off their
lazy asses and register to
vote, much less actually go
out and do it, is ludicrous.
For heaven’s sake, these are
people who can’t even walk
to a crosswalk to cross a
street and can barely be
bothered to vote for their
own SGB. What makes you
think they could be motivat-
ed into anything remotely
resembling a voting block?

In case you editorialist
hadn’t noticed, for every
speaker in favor of Bigelow
closing, there were two

Taiwan) or attempt a naval
blockade with their puny navy
or perhaps even attempt to
send a small army unit to cap-
ture one of Taiwan’s outlaying
islands, but the Chinese are
aware that any.such action
would precipitate a massive
military response from the
United States. The Chinese
would merely succeed in iso-
lating themselves with no pos-
sible reward, an illogical poli-
cy that would be almost as ill-
thought as the GOP’s election-
year attempts to bait the
Chinese.

My advice to the GOP is to
keep politics out of foreign
policy and let President
Clinton execute his role as
commander-in-chief as he is
authorized to do in the
Constitution. The GOP’s hys-
teria over China seems more
of an election-year ‘attempt to
provoke a crisis than an
attempt to seriously deal with

Senior, SLIS

First of all, let me tell you

that I am an employee of the .

University of Pittsburgh. I
am not proud of that today
(March 15) at all. I picked
up [today’s] The Pitt News
and inside was the VOX
magazine, which I assume
was authorized to be in The
Pitt News.

I was totally appalled at
an article called “Red Roses
For Me” printed on page 3. I
couldn’t believe that The
Pitt News could allow such
filth to be printed in our
paper. It condoned the use
of drugs, being a lesbian,
and the language used was
totally unacceptable, even in
today’s world  From the
first sentence I was sick to
my stomach 

As a parent, I would not
want my son or daughter to
be exposed to this trash.
And believe me, it will be a
long time before I pick up
another issue of The Pitt

Baseball splits pair against Big East foes

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

The weather was the Panthers’ best friend
and worst enemy in a 1-1 series of four sched-
uled games against Seton Hall and Rutgers
last weekend. Pitt lost the first game to
Rutgers, 8-6, in extra innings on Thursday.
The second game was called when it became
to dark to play. Two days later, after winning
the first game against Seton Hall, 12-4, the
second game was called because of snow.

When the weather cooperated, the wind
neatly deposited balls over the outﬁeld fence.
When the weather didn’t cooperate, snow kept
batters from identifying a pitch and possibly
robbed Pitt of two additional wins for its

record.

“It’s a shame they had to take the games
away,” said second baseman Joe Carter.

Carter had reason to be angry. He was hav-
ing some of his season’s best games. He hit a
home run, a triple and three doubles with ﬁve
RBI.

Caner credits part of his success with spend-
ing more time in the batting cages. The other
part was just luck, and Carter took advantage
of whatever opportunity he was given.

In Thursday’s game, others taking advan-
tage of the wind’s help in pushing the ball
over the fence were ﬁrst baseman Rob Garvey
and outﬁelder Jeff Sofran.

The wind-driven balls weren’t enough to
win. The bases were empty each time a home

run was hit, so the Panthers weren’t able to
create a large enough margin to hold off the
Scarlet Knights’ extra inning comeback

It was supposed to be a seven-inning game.
The Panthers led until the seventh, when two

. errors by third baseman Sam Crowley allowed

Rutgers’ players to advance and get into scor-
ing position.

Pitt’s early success made Rutgers’ Head
Coach Fred Hill ﬁnd problems with every-
thing. Hill ran out onto the ﬁeld calling a balk,
and the umpire didn’t agree. Hill contested
pitches throughout the game. His only satis-
faction came when the umpire agreed to tell a
Panther video-taping a left-handed batter not
to stand near the Rutgers’ players.

will take to the newly-
installed, artificial, grasslike
ground covering in the ashtray
by the rivers for their 1996
home opener.

Yes, that’s the ﬁrst-place
Pittsburgh Pirates.

Not only were they 4-1 after
Saturday and leading the
National League Central, they
had the best record in the NL.
That’s better than Atlanta, Los
Angeles and Cincinnati.

I’d put money on it that
there’s some guy in a back-

after the departures of Barry
Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and
Doug Drabek a few years ago,
in a drunken “it’s Friday and
I’m done with work at the
scrapyard for the week” stu-
por, he opened his mouth and
proclaimed that the next time
the Pirates would be in first
place would be when there’s
actually Major League Soccer
in the United States.

Guess what happened
Saturday. The San Jose Clash
beat Washington, D.C.,

Mullins sprints to track
stardom after a slow start baseball games

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

“Tonya Mullins is independent, a
strong woman, attractive, intelligent, per-
sonable. And talented.”

Those words of praise for the Pitt
senior and track star come from Head
Coach Steve Lewis. Even though Lewis
added “talented” almost as an after-
thought, it is hardly the least of Mullins’
traits.

Mullins has the eighth fastest time in
Pitt history in the 100-meter hurdles,
14.23 seconds, and in her junior year, she
was part of the Pitt indoor shuttle hurdle
relay team that set a world record of
29.10 seconds.

This year, at the Alabama Relays in
mid—March, Mullins was a part of Pitt’s
mile relay, the shuttle hurdle relay, and
the 800-meter relay. Plus, she competed
in the heptathlon — seven events in two
days. All in one weekend.

More importantly, she did them all
well. The first two of her three relay
teams won, and the 800-meter relay team
was winning before an ofﬁcial’s mistake
took the lead away. In the heptathlon, she
qualified for the ECAC championships.

Success is not new to Mullins. As a
sophomore in high school, she was ninth
in the nation at 400 meters and had one
of the top 10 300-meter times ever
recorded by a female high school athlete.
Not too shabby for someone who didn’t
even start running until eighth grade.

“My P.E. teacher said to me, ‘Won’t
you come out for the track team? You
could be really good, and it can take you
places.’ So I came out one day,” Mullins
said.

Track certainly has taken her places.
It’s taken her (and her teammates) to
Nebraska, Alabama, even Jamaica —
and that’s just in the past two months. It
can be a taxing schedule, but Mullins
came to college prepared for the travel.

Mullins was born in South Carolina
but grew up and had gone to high school
in Virginia. Her father was in the mili-
tary, so her family was displaced several
times. In Mullins’ junior year of high
school, her father was reassigned, and
her close-knit family moved to Copperas
Cove, Texas, where Mullins graduated
from high school.

Such moving may have brought her
closer to her family (so close that she
even refers to her cousins as “brothers
and sisters”), and it may have helped pre-
pare Mullins for the college travel sched-
ule, but on at least one occasion, it hurt
her athletics. The move from Virginia to
Texas brought her track career tumbling
down even faster than she had built it,
sending Mullins into a brief period of
uncharacteristic apathy.

“I didn’t run track. I played soccer and
volleyball and ran cross country. I got
uprooted, and at the time, my heart
wasn’t in it, so I didn’t do a lot,” Mullins
said.

Weather hinders

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

Weather may have disrupted many holiday
weekends in the Pittsburgh area, but no one
felt the winter encore more than the Pitt base-
ball team.

Four important Big East home games were
scheduled for the Panthers over the weekend.
Two were played. The other two were can-
celled, at least in part, because of the
onslaught of early-April showers.

They will not be rescheduled. Only games
against intra—division opponents are made up
in the Big East. Rutgers and Seton Hall are in
the opposite division, so Pitt loses two home
games that would have counted in the Big
East standings.

The players were not happy. “It’s a shame
that the umps called the game,” said Joe
Carter after Saturday’s Seton Hall snowout.
“When you’re out there playing, you don’t
notice it.”

Carter didn’t notice the snowflakes in the
first contest with the Pirates, knocking two
doubles and driving in four runs in the
Panthers’ 12-5 victory. The Pitt second base-
man reached on an error and stole a base in
the second contest, which was called with one
out in the last of the third thanks to the
increasing ﬂurry of ﬂurrics.

“We’ve been playing well,” said Carter.
“It’s a shame they take these games away
from us.”

The Panthers’ first game of the weekend set
reached its 12-inning conclusion late

Pitt's Crory prepares for Toe National Championships

By Armando E. Roggio
Staﬁ“ Writer

Anne Crory, a 23-year-old stu-
dent, was walking through the
University of Pittsburgh’s Division
of Pulmonary Allergy and Critical
Care Medicine, when a distin-
guished looking doctor threw up
his fists, yelled “Hiiiiiiyaahhh”
and began kicking wildly.

“He looked like he was having
an epileptic ﬁt or a seizure,” Crory
said of her boss.

Dr. Michael Donahue hadn’t
really lost his mind. He was sirn—
ply greeting Crory, who won two
gold medals at the state Tae Kwon
Do competition in Philadelphia on
March 11.

Crory, a second-degree black

belt, picked up the top honors in

the heavyweight women’s divi-
sion for poomse —— a formal series
of blocks, punches and kicks
designed to simulate combat with
multiple imaginary attackers —

and kyo reu gi, or spaning.

Tae kwon do, as a martial arts
form, is nearly 4,000 years old,
and finds its origins in ancient
Korea Traditionally, tae kwon do
forms were passed from master to
student by

the Tae Kwon Do National
Championships in May at the U.S.
Olympic training center in
Colorado Springs, Colo.

“I’m thinking [the trip will cost]
around $1,000,” said Crory, who

must pay her own way. ‘The air
fare will be around $300 if I book
now, and hotel for four or five

nights and then spending money.”
Since coming to Pitt, Crory has
studied under Master Kyu Ha

vation to Donahue, her supervisor
at Pitt's Division of Pulmonary
Allergy and Critical Care
Medicine where she works as a
research assistant.

“He has been a very big sup-
porter,” Crory said of Donahue.
“He was the one that talked me
into going. .

“So now he keeps me motivated
and makes sure I’m doing what
I’m supposed to do. It’s like I have
to go to Nationals just for  to
make him prou .”

Tae kwon do is already an inter-
nationally recognized sport and
will become an Olympic sport in
the summer games in the year
2000. Although Crory said she
wasn't thinking about the
Olympics yet, a strong perfor-
mance at Nationals could be a step
in the right direction.

Doing what has to be done and
going in the right direction are
daily events for Crory.

On a typical day, “I get up about
5:00 in the morning. I’m usua1ly'at
work at about 7:00,” Crory said.
“I’m done at 4:00. I come here [to
Master Kim’s club on Brownsville
Road in South Hills] about five
days a week I train seven, butI go
to Bally’s the rest of the time.”

In addition to training, Crory
sees a physical therapist, Dave
Pezzullo of the Sports Medicine
Institute, who treats Crory for her
recurring back problems.

“VV1th tae kwon do, there is a lot
of twisting and moving,” Crory
said

Crory graduated from Pitt last

April with a'Bachelor of Science’ A

degree in Communication Science
and Disorders and is still with the
university doing research

“I originally went to college for
pre-med, but I found the commu-
nication program very interest-
ing,” Crory said, although she
confessed that she won’t be doing
anything with her degree. Medical
school is likely to be in her future,
and, of course, tae kwon do.

The state competition was
Crory’s first tae kwon do touma-
ment, but she has competed many
times in karate, in which she also
holds a black belt.

Crory began studying tae kwon
do in 1984 when her father was
stationed in Korea with the Army.

In Korea, where tae kwon do is
a national sport, things move fast.

“It took me about a year to get
my first degree [black belt], and I
got my second degree a year later.
That is really fast,” Crory
explained. “Usually it takes years
and years.” -

When Crory and her parents,
Michael and Chong, returned to
the United States, there wasn’ta

' tae kwon do school near their

home in New Jersey, so Crory
began studying an Americanized
fonn of karate called kar do jitsu
ryu, which takes techniques from
a number of martial arts forms.

“When I first came to
Pittsburgh, I was looking for a
good martial arts school,” Crory
said. At the time it didn’t matter
whether it was karate or tae kwon
do. During her freshman year,
Crory heard about Master Kim’s
tae kwon do program at Pitt,
where you can still find her on
Wednesday nights, helping Master
Kim pass on the art

Saturday’s game,” Jethro continues. “I was on thee edge of
my rockin’ chair, cleanin’ my l2-gauge up nice. When he
weeeved through ‘dem two defenders and knocked dat ball
into the comer, it made me reminisce of Mario Lemieux. I
was so exciteed I went out to the still and set up a nice
batch ah my special rhubarb cider.

“Hey, speakin ah ‘dem Buccos, ain’t dey’s on dah te1eve-
sion now?”

And now back to reality. Or is it?

Who would’ve thought the Pirates would lead the NL in
team-earned run average? Every player and coach said dur-
ing spring training that the Pirates would go as far as their
pitchers would take them.

They have one of the best infields in baseball, with three
potential Gold Glove candidates. The outfield is consistent.
However, for the last three years, the pitchers haven’t been.

It’s hard to believe that the Pirates can attribute their best
start since 1983 to two starting pitchers, who are over 35
years old, righty Danny Darwin, 40, and lefty Zane Smith.

The five starters combined have an ERA of less than 1.5
and have only given up four runs in 28-2/3 innings.
Granted, its only five games into the 162-garne season, but
the great start by the weakest part of the team does wonders
for conﬁdence.

The hitting will be there. The ﬁelding will be there. It’s
imperative that the pitchers follow suit. If they do, it
wouldn’t be so unrealistic for the Pirates to potentially cap-
ture a National League wild card spot.

Then again, what are the chances of big league soccer
replacing mud bog racing as the number one television
sport at Dixie’s Comer Stop?

“Is there some NCAA rule I
don’t know about?” Head Coach
Mark Jackson yelled back as the
umpire moved the camera man
away from the Rutgers dugout.

Hill ,remained in a bad mood
until the. seventh, when a Rutgers’ ‘ .
double off Pitcher Mike
Rohrbach tied the game.

“We just fell apart,” Carter said.
“Our heads weren’t in the game.”

By the llth inning, there had
been so many substitutions in the
lineup, Jackson didn’t have any
extra fielders left to play third
base.

Pitcher Mark Skokowski came
out to play second base, and
Carter moved to third. Carter
didn’t adjust as quickly as he
would have liked and miscalcu-
lated a throw after a Rutgers sin-
gle.

“T he ball gets to you quicker,”
said Carter. “I shouldn’t have
thrown the ball to first.”

Carter’s error allowed Rutgers
outfielder, Adam Neubart, to
advance to third base on a hit but
didn’t result in a Rutgers score.

In the 12th inning, pitcher Rob
Shaffer, who started pitching in
the 10th, took the loss after walk-
ing a Scarlet Knight and allowing
the player to steal second. Kevin
Kramer replaced Shaffer but
didn’t stop the Rutgers rally.

The changes in positions and
the lineup had taken their toll.
Rutgers surpassed Pitt to win the
game.

“You run out of people. You
can only dress 25 for a game,”
said Jackson. “You try to win
with what you can.”

Rutgers finished the 12th
inning with a home run, and then
a series of errors put two Scarlet
Knights on base, resulting in a
three-run inning for Rutgers. A
bottom of the 12th home run for
Garvey wasn’t enough to keep
the game going.

Fortunately for Pitt, Mullins
had already caught Lewis’
attention before she moved.
Lewis, who coached high
school teams in Virginia for
years before coming to Pitt, saw
Mullins for the first time when
she was just a freshman in high
school, and his interest was still
high two years later. Lewis told
the story of how he recruited
Mullins. ‘

“The [collegiate track and
field] national championships
were in Austin that year, which
is about 35 minutes away from
where she was. The initial visit
was that June in Austin. She
was looking at Minnesota, and I
think it’s good that she didn’t
go there.”

likes all of her events, including
the hurdle races, but one of her
old ones sticks out.

“The 400 is a thrill race. It
takes a lot of mental toughness
to run it,” Mullins said.

Even off the track, Mullins

looks for excitement.

“I like anything that I can get
a thrill out of,” Mullins said. “If
it’s not that dangerous,” she
quickly added.

She does her best to get oth-
ers excited too. According to
Lewis, Mullins is “the biggest

enthusiasm is no smaller for her
own events.

“Anything I do, I try to do
well. I try to rise to the occasion
every time. I prepare as if it was

ous if taken too far, and Lewis
knows it.

“Some people will just run
and run until they drop,” Lewis
said. “She’ll go straight through
the pain even though she
should’ve stopped two events
ago. We ask more of her than
we should sometimes.”

Still, Mullins’ unique blend
of talent, enthusiasm and tough-
ness makes her a vital part of
the team.

“You have to have a Tonya
Mullins to have a successful
program,” Lewis said.

Equally as impressive as all
of Mullins’ other attributes is
her knack for time management
and planning.

“Nobody has to organize
Tonya Mullins about any busi-
ness,” Lewis said.

Indeed, Mullins is plenty
organized on her own, with her
days planned in advance,
minute by single-minded
minute. On busy, multiple—event

weekends, that means Mullins
knows exactly how long she
has to prepare for each event.

“When we get our list of
events for the weekend, I don’t
look at it like ‘I have to do all
this.’ I look at it like ‘OK, at
12:00, I have to start the hep-
tathlon,’ and I’m working with
the heptathlon only. I’m not
thinking about other events. I
take it one at a time,” Mullins
said.

Mullins has always had her
road planned out ahead of time,
and now she has her future pret-
ty well planned, too.

“I’m a student, then I’m an
athlete, so I’m preparing as a
student,” Mullins said. “If run-
ning is in the picture, I’m all for
it.”

That student-first mentality is
a lot of what drew her to Pitt to
begin with.

“I wanted to come to the East
Coast because I have family up

Mullins said.

There was just one minor
detail that Mullins didn’t plan

“I wanted to come north. At

After four Pittsburgh winters,
Mullins plans to correct that
decision by heading south after

of strong first two innings. This
time Pitt never lost the momen-
turn.

“|_The team] just carried it over
from Thursday,” said Jackson. “It
took a monkey off our back.”

The difference between the
home runs on Thursday and
Saturday was that this time play-
ers were on base. Against Seton
Hall, when Carter hit the fence
with a double, the bases were
loaded. The result was a ﬁve-nin
ﬁrst inning.

Outﬁelder Jason Conti started
off the game with a triple.
Outﬁelder Kult Womelsdorf then
bunted, and first baseman Rob
Garvey advanced on a walk, so
the Panthers were in position this
game to take advantage of
Carter’s hit. A little luck also
helped. I

Garvey would have been out.
As Garvey slid towards home, just
as he was about to be tagged, the
Seton Hall catcher dropped the
ball. Garvey and the catcher stared
at each other for a moment as if
they were surprised by the catch-
er’s mistake. Then, perhaps
inspired by the football-like tem-
perature, Garvey rushed the plate
and muscled his way past the star-
tled catcher.

Conti followed up on his suc-
cess in the ﬁrst inning by starting
off the second with a home run. In
the fifth inning, he hit another
triple and finished off his game
with a single in sixth that put him
in scoring position for third base-
man Kevin Knox’s home run.

Conti’s batting success places
him in second place behind Jeff

Murse as the only Panther hitting.

over .300. Conti also leads in
stolen bases. Womelsdorf, who

- also added two stolen bases, fol-

lows behind Conti. Other runs
were batted in by catcher Bill
Derr’s fourth-imiing home n1n and
a single by John Herlihy in the
third that sent Womelsdorf home.

Seton Hal1’s runs came after
two consecutive walks in the third
inning by pitcher Mike Rohrbach
and a fourth-inning two-run home
rim by Pirate V.J. Canero.

Weather

0From page 9
Thursday afternoon in the midst of a
moderate rainstorm. Naturally, the sec-
ond game started late, and the mixture
of extra innings, a wet field and a dark
sky forced a cancellation.

While the loss of the home game
hurts the Panthers, this home game
hurts even more. Before the cancella-
tion, the previously-dormant Pitt
offense had managed 10 runs in
Thursday’s dusk.

“We clicked in that second game
against Rutgers,” said Head Coach
Mark Jackson. That click will go
unrecognized in the statbooks and,
most importantly, in the Big East
standings.

Ironically, the weather came to the
Panthers’ aid in the early stages of
Thursday’s cancellation. With the
wind blowing out. Pitt drives were
pushing Scarlet Knight outfielders to
the wall even as the ball got harder to
see in the darkness.

“I’ve been known to have warning
track power,” said Carter, “so that
[wind] definitely helped.” Carter did
manage a four-bagger in the first con-
test —- one that will count in the stand-
ings.

While the rain cost the Panthers a
big lead, the Saturday blizzard may
have cost some fans their sanity. The
first game began with a light snowfall,
frigid temperatures and a Pitt offensive
explosion. The Panthers batted around
in each of the first two innings, scoring
eight runs thanks to Carter’s two dou-
bles and two hits each from Jason

Conti and Kurt Womelsdorf.

The Pitt offense slowed in the third,
giving Seton Hall a chance to cut the
lead with two-run spurts in the third
and fourth frames. Pitt answered with
one run in each inning, giving the
Panthers a 10-4 advantage.

The top of the fifth brought the first
wave of heavy snow. Of Pitt’s four hits
that came after the blizzard picked up,
two were bunt singles and two came
from Conti, who saw his way clear to a
4-5 day amidst the winter wonderland.
The Pirates managed only one hit,
thanks to a mix ‘  '
of flurries and
sidewinding --

first, and slowly the entire field was
shielded by the falling snow. In the
early going, fielders were faced with
picking up the white ball against the
white backdrop, causing what Pitt’s
Rob Garvey called a “3-D effect.”

“It’s hard to pick up the ball once it’s
in play,” said Garvey, who had to pick
up the ball quite often from his first
base bag. He picked it up quite well at
the plate on Thursday, with two home-
runs in the extra-inning marathon.

Pitchers and hitters also had trouble.

striking out Seton Hal1’s V.J. Carrero,
looking and then hitting Jim Duffy in
the back with a 3-1 fastball. Pirate
David Kim had the game's only hit in
three-plus innings, before the umpires
called the contest off.

“[The weather is] just something you
have to deal with," said Jackson. “It’s
reality in this part of the country.-”

Jackson was concerned with another
reality that was brought on by the
weather. “We only have four more
home games,” said the coach. “We’re
