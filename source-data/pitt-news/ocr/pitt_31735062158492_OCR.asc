The annual Fall Convoca-
tion of University students
and faculty willbe held Wed-
nesday, Oct. 29 at 10:30 a.m.
in the Soldiers and ‘Sailors

Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld will address the assembly.
He will speak on “Are Soviet Uni-
versities a Challenge to the United
States?”

The Chancellor’s address will be
based on_ his ﬁndings in Russia
during his visit there this past
summer. He headed a group of
eight American educators in their
visit to 18 Russian institutions of
higher _ learning.

The Fall Convocation will be
the occasion for the first major
address which the Chancellor
has made on his observations in
Russia. Hewill analyze the im-

One of the two major academic
convocations held "during the
school year, ‘the Fall Convocation

 School‘ Hsads TellWhy Increased Funds

     

Leaders of Pitt, the Univer-

sity of Pennsylvania, and
..Temple University /met in
‘Erie on Monday evening in
regard to the three schools’
‘requests for $23,800,000 from
the State legislature for the com-
ing' two ﬁscal _'years. ,
Of thisliiamount Pitt’s individual
request was for $7,830,000, a 65

— per cent increase over the total

received for the 1957-59 term.

Leaders of the three universi-
ties, at Monday's meeting, called
on their alumni and on civic lead-
ers in northwestern Pennsylvania
to support their request -that the
Commonwealth increase the

At the meeting‘ Chancellor

Millard Gladfelter, provost of

some 250 alumni and civic leaders
in the“ nine-county area the needs
of their institutions and the vari-
ous resources available for meet-
ing them. ' j- _ _» —

Citizens’ Cooperation Needed

“We must have the co-operation
of.al1 thoughtful citizens,” Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld said. “The cause
is larger than higher education. It
is the cause of the democratic
way.” »

In support of the proposal
that the State increase its ap-
propriations to the three insti-
tutions, the 'university heads
enumerated the services which
their institutions render to the
Commonwealth and to its citi-
zens. '

They, pointed out that almost
half of .the state’s physicians and.

graduates of the three universi-
ties. -
Low in State Aid
_They stated that more than half
the master’s and doctor’s degrees
awarded in the arts and. sciences
in Pennsylvania are conferred by
the three institutions; and that
nearly one out of every three
college and university students in
the state is enrolled at Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, or Temple. ,
The three educators further
pointed out that a study of sup-
port for higher education shows
that among the 48 states and the
District of Columbia, Pennsylvania

that will be awarcled to vending
agencies and which, as yet, remain
indeﬁnite. _
i Article Incorrect
It stated explicitly that “two of
the thirteen companies under con-
siderationshave already been se-
lected by oﬂicials."

Snyder maintains that no such
decision has been .made. “Wes
still don’t know which com-,
panies will eventually receive
the contracts,” he says. “Many
factors must be weighed before
a decision can be reached."

“We have asked all the com-
panies to submit bids. We have
also requested some of’ the come

Thus far, everything is tentative."

In addition to declaring that the

the Post-Gazette stated that one of
the companies contracted (The
Bar-O-Matic Company) is “headed
by Joe rFank ‘a local racketeer."
Frank is now serving an 18-month
sentence for tax evasion.

On this point, Snyder says
that the president of the com-
pany is not Joe Frank but Wally
Frank and that the University
knows nothing about any -of the‘

eteering interests.

The Auxiliary Enterprises head
claims to have been directly mis-

of the new vending program.

Survey Resu lts Reveal

-PhilosophyKnogwledge

Survey results, released by the Emerson Club, 'und.er- .
" graduate group at First Unitarian Church, show that Pitt,

Tech, and Chatham students know more philosophy than
theircounterparts of ten years ago._ ,

Over 600 Pittsburgh collegians-revealed some philosoph-
ical ignorance in their responses to the multiple-choice ques-

tionnaire given them in their dor-9
 mitories and dining rooms.

Chatham College led the lists

this year‘ as it did ten years ago-

The/1948 score was 36.2 per cent;
the 1958 score was 47.7 per cent.
Tech ran second again this year

with 44.4 per cent and Pitt placed
third with a score of 37 per cent,
although this is higher than

 Chathams’ winning score ten years

the late conductor of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, and to the
Protestant social reformer Wal-
ter Rauschenbusch.

Jacques Maritain a neophyte.
Only 29.3 per cent of the Pitts-
burgh undergraduates knew that
Dr. Maritain is this century’s
principal exponent of a,. revived

Students were asked to iden-
tify VVilliam James as one of the
following: idealist, realist, prag-
matist, or phenomenologist; 38.5
per cent answered pragmatist
correctly. ‘

Faculty reaction to the results
of the survey indicated encourage-
ment in the progress shown, with
some dissatisfaction at the remain-
ing degree of philosophical ignor-
ance among local college _students.

Emerson Club conducted the
survey as prelude to a new series
of presentations of contemporary
philosophies, scheduled for the

,  The Damage Is Done-

The damage done to many parties by the Post-Gazette
article on “racketeer owned” University vending machines
is great,. the constructive good, nil. V . \

Even if the_.facts had been correct, it is questionable

what value the article would have had. But the fact remains ‘‘ I
_ that the PG was all wet on several counts. ‘

A newspaper has an obligation to its readers to check
its facts well before publication, particularly those of a de-
famatory nature. The Post-Gazette article was evidently
written hastily to “scoop” the other papers and_without

‘ much thought. ' —

The simple fact that contracts had -been, sent to these

_two ﬁrms among others for exploratory examination and
with no thought that ﬁnal selection of the ﬁrms had been

determined was blown up to read that contracts had been

, signed.

Any confusion as to where the funds wouldhgo is pure
negligence on the part of the reporter and is inexcusable in

x a large city newspaper. _

' Auxiliary Enterprises head Sny’ er is well aware of
University procedure and no --doubt outlined to the Post-
Gazette staffer as clearly and completely as he did to the-
reporters from the, Pitt News -through ‘what channels the
money is to travel. _ "A V\

The fact that ‘Joe Frank, racketeer,’ may have an inter-

_ est in the Bev-O-Matic Company was blown up beyond all

Knox in ‘Disagreement

With Political. Column
Editor, The Pitt News:

Editorials are an important part
of any good newspaper.

In this letter I will not attempt
to discuss your opinions concern-
ing politics and politicians al-
though I wholly disagree with
them, but to enlighten you as to
the facts as related to my recent
appearancejon “Face the People”
on WQED, Channel ‘13, and to
which you refer in your Editorial
on Wednesday, October 15, 1958
in the Pitt News. '

Where .you say. "and,-rather
than face the issues, Knox con-
veniently avoided them with va-

garies and weak rationalization.” '

To quote.i':urther, “Knox was
asked by a‘ panelist‘ why Govern-
or Leader so rarely‘ speaks on
foreign policy when this is such an

important facet of a Senator’s
role.

"‘Knox- believes that he has
spoken on foreign policy and im-
plied strongly that the press must
not be reportingpwhat he says.

“This is one of the weakest lines
of argument I have ever‘heard.
The discussion preceding it reveal-
ed that Knox felt or claimed to
feel that the domestic role of a
Senator is more important than
the international one, which makes
Leader a stronger candidate than
Scott. To think I can only say
bah!” ,

Now, Mr. Editor, ‘I have taken
the time to get the facts (even
before your editorial was written).
Governor Leader has made
speeches and issued printed re-
leases tothe newspapers on many
occasions and the facts are as fol-
lows: /

dressed a Democratic Rally at _the

he though of

“I don’t think, I just draw. By -the way, who
did you say was running against Lawrence?” As

the cartoon accompanying this‘ column shows,
Johnston forgot. P

Thomas -Wheatley, standing city editor of the
Pittsburgh Press, thinks that Lawrence is the best
candidate since he has had the most experience
as an administrator. He adds “This is a very im-
portant factor since the governor can.hold oﬁice
for only one term in our state.”

After stating that he was in the unglamorous V
part of the journalistic profession, a gentleman in
the advertising department of the Pittsburgh Press,
commented, “Lawrence will be the boy allright, to A

Mayor Young for His lye

After°being askedif the Mayor had not outgrown
his usefullness, Andrew Bernhard, editor_ of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, replied, “Certainly. not.
The man is twenty years younger than most peo-'
plevhis age and twice as vigorous.” _ _ '

After a little-leaguer in one of the newspaper
‘oﬂices was asked what the best thing he thought
Lawrence could do was, he promptly replied, “The
best thinghe could do for the state is croak be-
fore helgets to l-Iarrisbu'rg.’’ ,

So it is, for the most part the journalistic pro-
fession of Pittsburgh is behind Lawrence aslmost
of do'wntown’s leading Republican business men are.

If public opinion follows the trend of the Press,
it seems quite probable that while‘ Lawrence is
dictating government policy from Harrisburg, the
defeated McGo_nigle— will still’ be selling pretzels

after the November election.

F ormer Chairman

Rebuts Letter W/riters
Editor, The Pitt News:

In answer to Mr. Gottesman and
Mr. Cooper who wrote regarding
the choice of Homecoming Queen,
I would like to say that I felt the

same way until last spring when~

I was in charge of the Queen con-
test for Carnival.

I was advisedto have the Queen

picked by the judges, but I had_
the same feeling expressed by the"
above gentlemen, and I insisted on _
views

a student election. My
changed at election time.
The ﬁrst day went ﬁne with a
good turnout. Then the trouble
started with posters being "stolen,
and general confusion arising
about who would watch the ballot
boxes and punch the ID cards.

Another idea that arose was that
such an election turns into nothing
but politics. By this I don’t mean
that the candidates were going
around asking‘ for votes; in fact,

all of the Carnival Queen finalists’

were very ladylike and modest
about the whole thing.

However, the different organiza-

tions that nominated the girls start I
campaigning and getting all their "

friends to vote for their nominee,

not because she is an attractive‘

girl who really deserves the honor, -

but because she was nominated by
their group.

_ With a board of judges who ex-
cell in the ﬁelds of fashion, beauty,
and modeling I feel a much better
choice ‘can be made without all
the politicing, frayed nerves, and
hurt feelings that arise.

If the student body ‘disagrees
with me, I wish they would start
backing the committee that setup

the contest, and when the elec-.

tion comes use their heads before
they act so that the committee
won’t have to put a watch dog at
each«ballot box to make sure that

everything is done in- a way that “

Letters  

In Defense of Group

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing this letter in de-
fense of a group which has ﬁrst
been made an example of and then
smeared across the front of this
paper in a manner which made
them seem to be the sole cause of
all the troubles which have con-
fronted Block P since its exist-
ence.

First of all your headline read
.“BLock P Bars Delts from Parti-
cipation.” It may interest you to
know that the chairman of Block‘
P offered to withhold the decision
of’ that group until Delta Tau_
Delta. could be represented at a
meeting of the block’s executive
board. _ —

_Delta Tau Delta refused to at-_'

tend such a —meeting‘ on the

a meeting the‘ previous -Monday
not to participate in any further

Block P activities, the reason being _

that because of certain personal
and political differences with the
executive committee of Block P,
the Delts realized that ‘nothwith-
standing who incited the trouble
in the block, they would be indict-
ed for it. Your headline would
have been more accurate had it
read: Delts Refuse Further Parti-

cipation in Block P. '~ I

Further on in the article is a
quote by Jack Hardman who in-
dicated that a group such as the
indifferent orb irre-
sponsible. To Mr. Hardman: I-low
cou1d!Delta Tau Delta be indiffer-
ent to Block P when the late Bill
Lane, Col. ’56 and a member of
Delta Tau Delta was one of the
key men in the formation of Block
P, and some of the officersof our
Fraternity served at’ that time as
row leaders in the block to assure
its successful ‘beginnihg?

One Bob DiCicco speaks 'of
many warnings. True, Delta Tau
Delta was warned, warned in’ the
most jactless and vulgar manner
of which Mr. DiC_‘icco could con.—_
ceive. These warnings consisted
of throwing insults and curses at
us in front of our dates and
friends and attaching to our Frat-

-A list of Mr. DiCicco’s exple-
tives would include some ofthe
crudest to be found in the English
language. Insulted and resentful
yes, but indifferent and irrespon-
sible, never. g

Again to Mr. DiCicco: Perhaps if
you would inquire of the specta-
tors on the opposite side of the
ﬁeld as to the success and clarity
of the formations presented at the
previous Saturday’s game in which
the Delts did not participate, you
would be required to ‘alter your‘
statement that “Block P is rapidly
becoming one of the top flash card
sections in the country.”

Certain unofficial sources have
remarked that only a “P”‘was
discernible. It seems that self-
praise used as a justiﬁcation often
falls‘§uite short of its mark.

‘ To Art Bloom: Concerning the
people in‘ the top six rows who
were waving their cards during
formations and the various people
who threw their cards: Will they
be punished or isn’t their connec-
tion with your politicalrivals im-
portant enough to warrant such
action? -

If you want to-put on some-
thing perfect you can’t have any-
one making mistakes. Accidental
mistakes can be overlooked but
when trouble is caused on pur-
pose, it is inexcusable.

There are certain rules and reg-
ulations which must be abided by,
A veryfundamental one is parti-
cipating fully in the various for-
mations at halftime. I

There are certain principles that
even the most base people in a
democracy live by. One of these
is that when guilty of a crime,
equal punishment will be, “Delt”
out to your ‘friends as well as to
your rivals. ' ‘ g _ - --

Chancellor Litchﬁeld, Presi-

felter added that the increased.
amount they had requested of
the State legislature would be
applied to general operating ex-
penses of the three universities,
, and would not include requests
for appropriations to their medi-
cal and veterinary schools.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld stated that
the crisis in American education
is the result‘ of two challenges
which it faces—one the challenge
of Russian education, the other a
domestic challenge resulting from
the ‘population increase in our own
country. . ‘ ,

Devoted to Education

The Russians devote themselves
to’ education in a thorough and
eﬁicient fashion which has pro.-
duced startling results, Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld and President Harn-
well reported. ' -V -

The two men, who visited
Russia this past summer to
study higher education in the
Soviet Union, rejectea the Rus-
sian principle of a narrow train-
ing of individuals to meet speci-
ﬁc objectives established by‘the
state. V .

However, they ‘said, the Rus-
sians work harder to achieve their
objectives than we do to attain
ours. or

Three School Heads Explain

Need For Increased Income

Chancellor Litchﬁeld identiﬁed
the domestic challenge as the ex-
pected “bulge” in the number of
students who will be seeking
higher education due .to the in-
creased demand for college and
university education. _

To meet~these challenges, the
audience was told that the three
universities are, trying to make
more efficient use of faculty, phys-
ical facilities, and all existing re-
'sources;‘ that students and pri-
vate sources are doing their share
to help the situation; and that
possibly the Commonwealth will
agree to increase its support.

The Grey Line
Comes To Town

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

With ten powerful opponents appearing on Pitt’s’sched-
ule each year, it is not surprising that at least one game an-

' nually gets recognition as the “top” pairing of the week. Last

year the opener against Oklahoma was the nation’s best foot-
ball game of that week, '

Similarly, .Saturday’s appointment with the'U.S. Military

Academy will be the number one attraction ‘in the country.
And both teams know it. -

.’The Pitt coaching staff has been ‘studying, analyzing,
and scouting Army continually since last October when the
Cadets thrashed the ,_Panthers, 29-13. It is rumored that even
Head Coach Earl Blaik doesn’t know his own men as thor-

' oughly as Johnny Michelosen does byxway of a network of
' classiﬁed information. (TheIAcademy was secretly wired for

sound by the Pitt electrical engineers during the last‘ Christ-
mas vacation. The broadcasts have been locally,monitored 24
hours a day.) There is no such animal as a military secret as
far as our “spies” are concerned.
* * * * * .

Whether the players around, here are as eager to wreak
revenge upon the Cadets as are their coaches is difficult to
determine. -The torpor which almost allowed West Virginia
to sneak through shows- signs of’ still clinging around‘ the
edges. And then additionally, whether they are in a’ ﬁghting
mood for Army may not make a great deal of difference if

the Cadets are as good as they appear to be after their ﬁrst

four games.

An aroused, “blood-in-their-eyes” team will be as me-
thodically slaughtered as an uninspired one. The only differ-
ence would be that the latter team will be ground under with
less of a -death struggle. ‘ - —

The Cadets are rated as best in. the country, Their total
offense is also the highest of all major colleges. Joe Caldwell,
Bob Anderson, Harry Walters, and Pete Dawkins could easily
be the most brilliantly effective offensive backﬁeld anywhere.
Each is a driving runner and a threatening passer.

The defense is highlighted by ‘an experienced line that

-last year used everything, including illegal tactics, to hold

Pitt back. (That- ﬂagrant holding which their line employed
should itself be enough to inﬂame this year’s Panther team.)
. =I= =I= =I= * =I=

When Army’s backﬁeld comes up for discussion it is dif-
ficult to avoid_ spending a few hundred words on Pete Daw-
kins. The swift back and team captain is the player of the
year as far as sports publicists are concerned. With the surge
of the Cadets, Dawkins has stood outmost prominently. He
is what the sideline athletes refer to as “one of those damned
all—star All—Americans.”

Dawkins is‘ first cadet of the corps, president of the senior
class, an A- student, and as modest as a flower‘ in the cran-
nied wall if Life is to be believed. Clearly, however, he is an
exceptional young man—and the military sorelyneeds that
commodity at the moment.

But Blaik Willi Have ‘ Anderson,
Dawkins, Co. As Extra Support

_ By FRANK PINKUS ’

Many people often ask ‘the question, “What type of foot-
ball team would have an ass as its-mascot?” Those who know
about this team have voted it the nation’s No. 1 team in both
the United Press International and Associated Press ‘polls.

The men led by a mule are from the United States Mili-
tary Academy situated along the Hudson River. Better known
as Army, they have a record ofé
four straight wins going into this
Saturday’s game at the Stadium.

The new "‘lone1y end” offense
Coach Earl Blaik has thrust into
the football world has made its
mark statistically as w,el1;as im-
aginatively. ~

The Cadets are second in the

_ nation in total offense with 440;,

yards gained per game, and they

‘hold third place in forward pass-

ing, having completed 35 of 77

‘for ‘684 yards and seven touch-
downs. ’

The West Pointers opened the
season against South Carolina and
proceeded to decapitate the Game-
cocks, 45-8. They rolled for over
500 yards on the ground and in the
air.

The following week Penn State
visited the.Cadets and was badly
trounced, 26-0. After this battle
Army was averaging 515 yards per
game to lead the nation.

A Two weeks ago the‘ Cadets
met the Fighting Irish at South
Bend, Indiana, and came home
with a well-e/arned victory, 14-2.
Last week ‘Virginia was the vic-
tim by the score of’35-6. This

week marks the mid-point of an
undefeated season with Rice and
Navy the only major opponents
to be met after Pitt. .
What makes this _team go is a
restyled offense which has right

tackle that he ,doesn’t even rejoin
the“ team in the huddle, getting
his signals from the right tackle.

' penter is the man getting all the
attention at this unique post.

At tackle are Ed Bagdonas,
200 pounds, and Maurice Hil-
liard, 210. Hilliard last year
kicked a ﬁeld goal against the
Panthers for his only successful
“three-pointer of the season.

Guard is manned by two seniors,
Chuck Lytle and Bob Novogratz,
and the center is Bill Rowe.

In the backﬁeld lies the real
strength of the Black Knights.
Sophomore Joe Caldwell has
earned the signal calling post and
has shown he is highly capable of
the position. ' «

At fullback is IHarry Walters
who has a better than 4.5 yards
per carry average. .

No team in the country has a
better pair of halfbacks than
those of the Cadets. Bob An-
derson, at left half, was an All-
American choice at the end of
his sophomore season. _

. Captain Pete Dawkins, his run-

end lining up so_ far from the-

ning mate, may turn out to be,’
even better when the 1958 returns ‘

are all in. Last season the pair
scored 25 touchdowns. Anderson
last year rushed-for 983 yards and

was second in the nation with 14

touchdowns.

So far this season Anderson
has scored only two touchdowns
while Dawkins already -hasseven
to his credit. ~

This game is also important in
thatthe winner has one leg up on
the ‘Lambert Trophy, symbolic of
Eastern football supremacy. The
Cadets are ﬁrst with a perfect 10.0
rating with the Panthers follow-
