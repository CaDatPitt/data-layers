lnterAction
Council

to convene

at Pitt

By David Ballarotto
For The Pitt News

Eight former heads of state will
meet today at Pitt to discuss eco-
nomic, political and social
problems occuring throughout
the world, marking the first time

any university has hosted such a

meeting.

The symposium, I called
’’Challenge for Leadership,” will
be held today in the Lower

Lounge of the William Pitt Union I

from 10:45 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
Featured speakers are members
of the lnterAction Council, in-
cluding Helmut Schmidt, former
chancellor of the Federal Repub-
Iic of Germany.

Dr. Ursula Davis, Bicentennial
Symposium co-ordinator for in-
ternational studies, saidthat to-
day's meeting is part of Pitt's
bicentennial celebration.

”The symposium has been an
ongoing project. There are 10
academic conferences that have
their highlights Wednesday and
Thursday. I thought it would be"
a good idea to get these former
heads of state since they no
longer have to worry about inter-
national boundaries,” said Davis.

The lnterAction Council has
never before held a meeting of
this sort on a college campus. Da-
vis said the council was im-
pressed with Pitt and its
understanding of world changes.

’’I talked to Ambassador
[Layachi] Yaker of Algeria, and he
saidhe is very impressed with the
things he-saw and what we had
scheduled for the symposium. I
told him we were very serious
about international relations and

having our students having the.

chance to learn about interna-
tional interdependence,” Davis
said.

Davis said Pitt has prepared.

five topics for the symposium, in-
cluding economic changes, open
societies, technological changes,
the role science should play in
the world and leadership.

Davis said the council appeals
to former government leaders be-
cause it allows their names to re-
main topical. ’’It is very common
in Europe to be prime minister
and a few years later be.prime
minister again. So they stayin the
political limelight.”

Moyer says no task force

By Frances Sansigll
Contributing Editor .

In reply to recent confusion sur-
ronding the Allocations Commit-
tee, Student‘Government Board

President Phil Moyer said that he »

has no intention of implementing
a task force to monitor student or-

.ganizations’ functions. F

”We trust them,” he said of the
student organizations. Also he
said that he did not deem such a
task force necessary, nor any
other measures to check on use
of student organization events.

The controversy surrounding
an allocations task force to ‘ma-
nitor the events of campus or-
ganizations arose when a story in

February 25 issue_of The Pitt

News quoted Allocations Chair-

woman Karen Bohichik as saying,

”... We've decided that, as a task
force, we're going to start send-
ing members of the Allocations

Committee to look into where‘ the

money's going,”

Moyer later told The Pitt News
that Bohichik~”overstepped her
bounds” when she made that
statement. . ,

”The task force was just a con-
ception in our minds as to what
could be of benefit to the board
in making our decision-making
process easier,” said Moyer. .

Moyer has since said that Bo-

hichik has executed a fine job in

fulfilling her duties.

”The idea of-a task. force. came.
about only because of budget res-
traints,” said Moyer. ”So*far, the
Allocations Committee has done
a fantastic job in keeping us with-
in our budget. I ‘

”The task force was
just a conception 
— Phil Moyer

”It was more or less -to be
offered to the board, not neces-
sarily implemented by the Allo-
cations Committee, as an
information—gathering‘ body. ..
The task force,_ as was stated,
would not be under allocations
jurisdiction. It would be there to
find out if the funds the students
pay are being used forthe pro-
grams that they were designated
for,". said Moyer. I" ‘

A consequence of Bohichik’s
statement has been the ”gag
rule,” stipulating that no member

— of the Allocations Committee

may speak to the press except Bo-
hichik, and then only when Moy-
er is present. ' '
”Together [Bohichik and he]
we came to the decision I would
be present at all interviews,” said
Moyer.
_ According to Moyer, the com-
mittee has a spokesman only to

 

» voice the'recommeridations of?"

the committee to the board, and
that it is not a unit for the use of
the general population.

”|t’s an element that's for the

I use of the board,” said.Moyer. ”l't

was more or less a means of
creating much more communica-
tion within ‘the board.” ,

'Moyer said it is clearly stated in
the SGB constitution that the
President is the chief spokesman
for all committees under the
board's jurisdiction, which in-
cludes the Allocations Com-
mittee. ‘

”We really didn't need to have
the idea [of a gag rule] come
about;  It's stated in the consti-
tution,” said Moyer.

Moyer said there are,troubIe
spots within the allocations
process, otherwise there would
be no appeal‘ hearings. .

' He said the idea of checking for
attendance ‘at organization func-
tions disturbs him. '

”We like to stay away from the
idea . of majority programming.
Minority funding is just as impor-
tant if not more important. We
need to present to the students a
variety of programs — a potpourri
of things to do. We don't neces-
sarily want to discourage on the
grounds - of attendance,” said
Moyer. ‘ ’

According to Moyer, a task
force would only become neces-

Deaver tries to prove counsel unconstitutional

WASHINGTON —— A federal
appeals court Tuesday dissolved
an emergency stay and left lob-
byist and former White House
aide Michael K. Deaver vulnera-
ble to the first grand jury indict-
ment sought by an independent
counsel.

It was not immediately clear
whether lawyers for Deaver
would appeal to the Supreme
Court in an attempt to prevent the
grand jury from voting on an in-
dictment. Deaver has filed suit to
have the office of independent
counsel declared unconstitu-
tional.

Independent counsel Whitney
North Seymour Jr. has stated in
open court that he is seeking to
indict Deaver on four perjury
counts.

In eight independent counsel
investigations, four of them still
active, no one has been indicted.

Nurse shortage forces
hospital to raise pay

PITTSBURGH — West Penn
Hospital, facing a shortage of
registered nurses, is offering new
nurses a week's salary for work-
ing two 12-hour shifts on
weekends.

The Pittsburgh hospital, which
currently employs 412 registered
nurses, is seeking as many as 89
additional nurses, said Allison
Leak, vice president of patient
care services.

West Penn Hospital's plan
would have weekend nurses
working two 12-hour shifts for the
same salary and benefits as week-
day nurses working five eight-
hour shifts, according to Ms.
Leak. The plan gives weekday
nurses every weekend off, she
said.

”This is something that will
give nurses what they want and

enable us to combat an increas-

nurses,” Leak said Monday.

Nine held for trial in
prison guard beatings

PITTSBURGH — A district
justice has ordered nine prisoners
held for trial but dismissed
charges against three others in the
beatings of two prison guards
during the Jan. 27 fires and dis-
turbances at the State Correction-
al Institution in Pittsburgh.

The nine prisoners were
charged in an assault on guard
John Britt, 48, of Pittsburgh, who
suffered a head wound requiring
75 stitches to close. Britt was
beaten after an early morning fire
prompted authorities to evacuate
about 800 inmates from their
cells.

Birds higher than ever
after pecking at plums

BEAVER, Pa. — The early bird
may catch the worm, but the sea-
son's first flock of robins are
bound to catch a hangover from
the plum tree at the Community
College of Beaver County.

College president Dr. William
Bauer said about 20 robins and
several gray waxwings feasted
Monday on fruit that apparently
fermented during the winter on a
10-foot plum tree in a college
courtyard.

Bauer said he and other college
officials observed many birds ap-
parently staggering on the ground
and others missing attempts to
land on nearby branches.

Poindexter invokes the fifth before sub-committee  

By Jim Drinkard

Associated Press Writer

John M. Poindexter, President
Reagan's former national securi-

'ty adviser, today invoked his right

against self-incrimination before
a House subcommittee inves-
tigating Reagan administration ef-
forts to restrict public access to
sensitive information in federal
computer systems.

Testifying under oath, Poindex-
ter invoked the Fifth.Amendment
four times in response to ques-
tions from the House Govern-
ment Operations Committee
chairman, Rep. Jack Brooks,

about a directive Poindexter
wrote last year to restrict such in-

formation even though it was not

classified.

Poindexter resigned as Rea-
gan’s national security adviser
Nov. 25 in the wake of revela-
tions that the United States had
sold arms to Iran and that some
of the profits may have been
diverted to Nicaragua’s Contra re-
bels. He also invoked the Fifth
Amendment before Congress
when asked in December to tes-
tify about that affair.

provide for the security of sensi-
tive data in federal computers
while permitting free public ac-
cess to unclassified information
useful for scientific, technical and
engineering purposes.

Poindexter issued a ‘directive
on October 29, 1986, which ex-
panded the government's
authority to restrict public access
to classified and sensitive infor-
mation in a wide range of scien-
tific, economic and cultural areas.

The directive went beyond a
national security decision direc-
tive in 1984 that had been signed
by President Reagan.

”This directive gave the nation-
al security agencies the.authori-
ty to control public access to
unclassified information located
in civilian agencies and even the
private sector,” Brooks said of the
president's 1984 order in open-
ing the hearing.

’’In effect, this gave the‘

Defense Department and the in-
telligence community ‘big
brother’ control over all com-
puter systems in the country,”
Brooks added.

Poindexter’s later directive ”is
an operational order demanding
that all agencies of the federal

3

government take certain actions,”
Brooks said, actions which
alarmed civil liberties groups and
researchers.

Rep. Frank Horton of New
York, the subcommittee’s~senior
Republican member, said the
Reagan administration had re-
cently rescinded Poindexter’s
directive while it studies the in-
formation security issue.

Before Poindexter asserted his
Fifth Amendment rights, his law-
yer, Richard Beckler, verbally at-
tacked Brooks for forcing his
client to appear personally before
television cameras.

More students affected by stress

By Matt Hosking

For The Pitt News

There has been a recent in-
crease in the number of students
invol-ved in the stress manage-
ment workshops offered by the
Student Health Service.

According to Shona Sharif, a
graduate student who conducts
the workshops, this increase is
due in part to more public aware-
ness. She also said that in the
past, most students have seen the
act of seeking help as a sign of
weakness.

”We get a lot of referrals from
the clinic [the Student Health
Service's clinic]. These are stu-
dents who are showing physical

symptoms, such as headaches

and ulcers, as a direct result of
stress. The students think that
there is something wrong with
them if they are feeling a lot of
stress, so most of them won't seek
help.” A

Sharif said that certain
categories of students are more
prone to have stress-related
problems than others.

”Engineers especially have a
very tough curriculum, with no
electives and little chance for ex-
ercise and relaxation. Also, older
students such as graduates and
commuters sometimes ex-
perience problems because many
have full-time jobs and families to
worry about." A

Other factors that typically con-

tribute to stress for Pitt students

are the fast-paced city environ- V

ment with its smog and noise,

problems with roommates and '

friends and the inevitable aca-
demic pressure that all students
feel at one time or another.
Sharif said that a fundamental
change in lifestyle is the most
positive.way to reduce personal
stress. — D
”Proper nutrition, enough

sleep, exercise, support systems _,

such as social groups and clubs,
learning to ‘relax and maintaining
realistic goals — these are the im-

portant areas to focus on when "

you feel a lifestyle change is
needed.” ’

Teen suicide can

force us to think

In the past two weeks, there has been a rash of suicides across
the country. Teens have been killing themselves to solve their
problems, to escape reality, to get away from their parents.

We all cry, we all wring our hands, telling ourselves it's tragic
but that if there were someone close to us ready to kill them-

. selves, we would know about it. Sadly, that isn't the case.

Suicide, as many psychologists will agree, is something we
all think of from time to time. Some think about it very seri-
ously, occasionally seriously enough to make an attempt —— pos-
sibly a successful attempt. V

There is some good that can come of the whole sick series

T of events. A large number of people need someone to help or
_ just someone to talk to -— someone to tell them that there are

alternatives other than suicide to what seem to be very real
problems to some teens.

When asked what they thought of the suicides, teens, first
in New Jersey and then in Chicago, said they couldn't believe
such a thing could happen in their communities and that they

. wished the media would just leave them alone.

The media shouldn't leave the problem alone, nor should
the media descend to the pits ofvulgarity by sensationalizing

" it. There is no good to come of that but more teens among the

obituaries. .

Young people follow fads, they are willing to experiment with
anything that might be interesting, attention-getting or problem-
solving. As a teen, few are truly a-ware of the ramifications of
death, of the threat of mortality.

To keep the problem from spreading, a strong support serv-

I ice is needed, both. in the public and private sectors.- There needs
' to be a place for distraught people to go to learn how to cope.

Already, some such service devices are in place. There are

- numerous hotlines for free counseling and referral. Ideally, the

guidance system in the public schools should serve in such a
"capacity. Fatally, many do not. ’
‘We can help our friends to get the counseling they need,

 whether it is from a service or from ourselves. There needs to
be agreater participation from all of us in solving what is a

tragic .and -unnecessary problem.

Cats are people as well

Cats, you might agree, are a
remarkable species. Making their
domesticated appearance during
the reign of the pharoahs, they
are immortalized in the stone of
ancient Egyptian sculpture. So,
we owe them a great deal. They
are our perfect homebodies and
have been so for a millenium.

In a modern supermarket,
checking prices, the cuisine for
felines was less than appetizing.
Wanting something special for
my cat, nevertheless, there were
few things on the shelf that
looked recommendable. Not that
humans are supposed to like cat

food. Even before stories of very ,

poor elderly people eating pet
food began leaking from Detroit,
there were reasons to compare
human fare with animal grub.
This may sound like ancient his-
tory, but the 1970 King Crimson
song said it well: ”No use to com-

plain if‘ you're caught out in the ,

JAMES CRARY

reign, you're mother's quite in-
sane, catfood, catfood, catfood,
again.”

The shock -of my supermarket
story is that having settled on a
diet for Grendel, my cat, the
check-out clerk charged me tax.

Here's one for animal rights ac- ’

tivists looking for a cause. Tax on
catfood? Once upon a time, we
didn’t.tax necessities in Pennsyl-
vania. Don't even bother me,
don't even speak, if you think cats
aren't a necessity.

Some people don't agree, I-_

know. Indeed, cats are used as
laboratory specimens. Whatever
cancer might strike me someday,
I can tell you I will get a lot more
comfort from my cat, whole and
composed, than with a ‘hole
drilled in its skull to measure ner-

vous decay from someone’s cra-
zy new pesticide.

My roommate tells a cat anec-
dote. He’s a developer who hires
a carpenter now and then. He be-
lieves that there is a very definite
working’-class mind-set. He
doesn't have that mind—set, and
he's careful not to pretend he has.
”It’s like pretending you're a cat
to a cat. If you start ‘acting like a
cat to a cat, they don't trust you.”
I guess it's something like a de-
coy ‘syndrome.

Anyway, cats are one of the
miracles in nature that don't take
too much extra thought for hu-
man beings to enjoy and appreci-
ate. They don’t have to be kept
in zoos. They don't bite. They are
cheap to feed. Their food
shouldn't be taxed.

The Cathedral turns trashy?  

As a freshman, I came to Pitt
optimisticabout my next four
years. I was aware that there
would be bad times, as well as
good times, and at this point I can
say I have had some really good
times in my studies with my
friends. However, I am very dis-
apointed in this university. The
educational and living facilities of

. the University of Pittsburgh

represent a serious health hazard
to students and staff.

The Cathedral "of Learning is
truly an inverted mineshaft! The
landscape and exterior feaures of
the Cathedral look very attractive,
and in fact, they are quite impres-
sive. A skyscraper towering in the
name of education. That sounds
poetic, but poetic isn't reality.
The realities of the Cathedral are

..the dark, dusty, dirty and smelly

corridors and rooms. There have
been days when I have choked
on the stench of my classrooms.
‘I look at the floor and see coffee
and Coke stains which were
made by a student who acciden-
tally spilled hisdrink in January.
In some rooms, there arelstains

from last‘ term. When beamsof .

LETTERS

‘light shine in the windows I can't

help but see the incredible
amount of dust and dirt floating
in the air. Many times, my profes-
sors have choked on the chalk

dust that has accumulated in the I

room because the dust has never
been completely cleaned up.
Now, I understand that be-

cause Pitt is in the heart of Pitts- I

burgh the air quality will not be
high. But does the air. quality
have to be so bad? I don't think
so. No wonder so many students
get sick. If the health of a-student
deteriorates, academic perfor-
mance will deteriorate’ also. I
wonder if Dr. Posvar’s office is as
dirty as the cleanest of my class-
rooms. I bet it isn't. Those class-
rooms are my office 17' hours a
week, and I have a right to be in

an office environment where I '

can‘ perform. The building called
Cathedral is a dungeon. Some-
thing should be done. _.

[...] Pitt is celebrating‘ its 200th.
anniversary. The university is

proud of its academic programs
and services to business and the
community. Still, the university
has nothing to be proud of when
it comesto the condition of its fa-
cilities. I know other students and
faculty members who are an-
gered about the poor environ-
ment of the university's buildings.
Now is the time for the universi-
ty to take action and improve the
unhealthy conditions of the
Cathedral, the dormitories, the
cafeterias and other buildings on

cam pus.

Banning bull from books

Why do we want to exclude
religion from our children's text-
books? Are we afraid they might
learn something that conflicts
with the tenets of belief they have
been taught? Do we want them
to‘ not be exposed to other ideas?
I really can't tell. -

There was a case before the
Supreme Court concerning a
judge in Alabama who had ruled
that secular humanism, the teach-
ing of belief in our abilities as
separate from divine creation, es-
sentially a celebration of the hu-
man condition, was a religion

and should not be promoted _in A

textbooks. Separation of church
and state, remember? 1

The offensive part of the ruling
was not the exclusion of a reli-

gious teaching from a textbook,‘
but the labeling of a religion, _

based on the accusations of a
group external to the supposed
religious group. Wow.

All this time, I thought itwas up

to the people holding certain be-
liefs to decide when they had
crossed the fatal line from
philosophy to religion. '

But; this case seemed to be_

different.
There was a group of Fun-

. damentalists who wanted to label

a group of people as a religion to
exclude them from something, in
this case the pages of a history
text.

I may be way off base, but I
thought the idea of church and
state was originated to help peo-
ple escape persecution, not to
point them out to be discriminat-
ed against. _

If such a dismal appraisal were
accurate, it would be a huge leap
‘backward from the progress we
have madein this country.

Aren't you horrified? All the
papers are reporting a huge
problem in Oakland with under-
age drinking. Just think of it:
hundreds of '18- to 20-year-olds
actually imbibing alcoholic
beverages. Doesn't the very
thought strike disgust in your
hearts?

I thought not. Drinking has i

long beenaccepted as an integral
part of college life, andwhether
it is right or wrong, the law does
little to change it. V

‘ Is there anyone out there under
the age of 21 who doesn't drink

because it's against the law?

Granted, there are many people

under 21 who don't drink, but_
-very few will cite the law as their

reason for abstaining. , .
The major misconception
about -drinking among 18- to
21-year-olds is evident is what it
is being called: an underage
drinking problem. First of all, are
18 to 21 year olds underage? If

_so, why are they permitted to

vote, to drive, to marry (in some
states) and to join the armed
services?

Second of all, is drinking
among 18- to 21-year-olds a
problem? It is illegal for a 20-year-
old to drink one beer, yet legal for
someone possibly only a few
weeks older to get completely
sloshed? _

If the government really wants
to do something about the under-
age drinking "problem," what it
should do is abolish the drinking
age.-.

Think about it. What the drink-

ing age serves to do is to glamo- '

The whole premiseiof free so-

ciety would seem to be based on
an accurate presentation of facts,
based on whatever evidence is
available, and then freedom for
us to draw our own conclusions.

It was a system conceived to,

promote the flow of knowledge
in a less than perfect society. It
was a device designed to let us I
grow and learn from past mis-
takes,

whether logical or

I find it hard to believe that any

group would want to participate
in the repression of any other.
However, the situation at hand '
seems to be exactly that. If we
lump theteachings of science
into a religion, and then claim
them to exclude the dogma of
any specific religion, we would
easily have a fair case for dis-
crimination.

The teachings in most text-

books focus on the human con-
dition. It is the only condition we
can observe. The dogma in most
religions is_based, in teaching and
. moral code, on the words or sup-
posed words of a higher being.

' rize alcohol. By saying one must

- be an "adult" to drink, the

government sends out the mes-
sage that drinking is an "adult”
thing to do. Since one must be
older, and therefore presumably
more responsible, to drink a beer
than to vote or join the service,
we must assume that the govern-
ment believes it is a more signifi-
cant thing to drink alcohol than

. to defend one’s country or to

elect the most powerful public

official in the free world.

’Few other countries have -a
mandatory drinking age, and few
other countries have a ‘problem
with underage drunkenness.
Most foreign students are bewil-
dered at the obsession American
students seem to have with drink-
ing. Probably because it.has al-
ways been available to them,
alcoholjdoes not carry the same
mistique or sophistication it does
for American‘ students. ,

. In a letter printed in._ this

1

Such teachings can provide a ‘

provocative explanation, but not
one that can be proven. If we are
to be fair, we must have the most
feasible explanation taught in our
schools.

When the Fundamentalists in
Alabama, only one of the many
faith groups in the country, wish
to have something with good
backing, humanevolution for ex-
ample, banned from textbooks
because it conflicts with their be-
liefs, they should be stopped.

In an even worse case, they
might wish to have their own re-
ligious beliefs inserted in the only
history many will ever learn, they
are essentially asking for their
religion to be taught. That simply
is notacceptable.

A school would do well not to
ignore the huge influence
religions have had in our history;
that would be an obvious and
painful omission. ‘They should,
though, stop far short of promot-
ingthe ideals of a religion in the
classroom. '

The first religions regarded the
sun and the moon as gods. They,
as we all well know, are not.
Religions have often been
crutches for what we as a people

can not explain. It would seem I.

foolish to expect that we have
reached the pinnacle of
knowledge and that we finally
have the truth _—..about anything.
. Teach the effects the religions
have had, not their beliefs, as fact.
That is the only thing we can truly

know. Anything else would seem .

a thinly disguised prejudice, and
boy, how we hate a prejudice in
this country.

spective editor for The Pitt News. '

Abolish the drinking age!

- newspaper last week, someone

brought up the point that the
government must be consistant in
its definition of "adulthood." Is
it not a more awesome responsi-
bility to vote for the president and
to join the armed services than to
drink alcohol?

Whether it is "right" for any
person to become intoxicated, is
a matter of personal values. But
whatmakes it worse for someone
18 years old to become intoxicat-

‘ed than for someone 21?

In a discussion of the drinking
age, one man pointed out that it
would be horrible to abolish the
drinking age, for if it were
abolished, how was he to ‘know
that his 11-year-old son wasn't
out getting drunk?

The point is, how is he to know
that is 1 1-year-old isn't out getting
drunk now? One often hears sto-
ries of young children not only
being drunk but being alcoholics.

If this man's son were to ask him_ ’

why it is wrong to get drunk,
would this man's only answer be,
"Because it is against the law?"
A mangso opposed to his son's
getting drunk would hopefully
have better reasons for
moderation. '

I The mandatory drinking age of

21 is not only arbitrary but con- ,

tradictory. The.message to 18-,
19- and 20-year-olds is that drink-
ing is more important than other
legal rights and priviliges to
which they are entitled.

Woody Hayes -
the man, the idol

The last time I saw
Woody Hays was just be-
fore he got sick. I was in
Columbus, and I asked him
if he'd like to have dinner. _
Woody was one of the
most important influences
in my growing up; a lot of
people didn't like him, but
I don't think they under-
stood what he was really
like. As a kid, I watched
him from afar. One of the
great joys of my adult years '
was that we became  
friends. ' V _

I asked him where he would like to eat, but I knew the an-_
swer already. "TheJai Lai," Woody said. Thejai Lai, just a few
blocks from Ohio Stadium, was where he always ate when din-

 

 

ing out. Even though he was no longer the football coach at,‘
Ohio State University, thejai Lai displayed a portrait of Woody ‘

in his coaching uniform, along with a sign saying "In All The

"World, There's Only,One."

I tried to be early for our appointment —— Woody was 72, and
I thought it would be impolite to make him wait — but when
I arrived he was sitting in a chair next to the hostess’ counter.
I apologized. "That's all right," Woody said. "I’ve been com-
ing to this restaurantfor more than 30 years, I feel comfortable
here.” I

We went to our table. Woody started to talk, and I noticed
the slight lisp that always surprised people who had not met

him. The conversation got around to the fact that he had never, .

left Ohio for a bigger city; he had been born in Ohio, and that's
where he stayed. ‘ I ‘

''Well, I'm glad I didn't grow up in New York, if that's what
you mean,” Woody said. "If‘| had grown up in New York, I
think Iwould have been much more impersonal. I wouldn't
have had so many people in the community looking out for
me. I grew up in Newcomerstown, Ohio, and when you grow
up in a community like that, they know what you are doing..
They know when you do something wrong.”

"They know everything about you. They know your feelings, .

your respones.  They'll see you doing something, and they'll
want to.say,_. {Now I know you, you're the Hayes’ .Iittle,boy,'_.

Woodrow, aren't you?’ They might not tell your parents on you,... j  
_ but they'll let you know‘that they've seen you're up to no good.  i ~
'And it's good for you, to have people watching you like that. 1‘ '

"Now Thomas Wolfe, he may have been the greatest writer
of‘al|, he was the one who said you can't go home again be- .

caus it has changed and you've changed. B_ut I'll never forget’ ‘_

what it was like in my hometown. We never locked the door.
We came home, and there would be a cake on the table —
Mrs. Burris or Mrs, House would have brought it over and left
it for us. If it was Mrs. Burris, then there would be a picture
of William Howard Taft on the plate; and -if it was Mrs. House,
there would be a picture of Woodrow-Wilson, on a blue plate.
And we would return it with another ca_ke on it." . .
Our waiter was a little nervous. On the one hand, Woody
was a steady customer of the Jai Lai, but on the other hand,4
he was the most famousman in Ohio. He ordered a light dinner.
"My health isn't quite as good as it used to be," Woody said.
"I used to eat a lot of red meat —— roast beef, steaks. Nowadays,
I can't handle heavy food in the evening.I can't sleep worth-
a dime. I used to read more, but I can't do it as much now be-
cause of my eyes. — l - g _
"My wife and I have lived in the same house for 34 years.

‘I At the restaurant here, while I was waiting for you, everyone? fg 

who came in,lI knew them. But several timesl had to'ask‘my—

self, 'Who the dickens was that fella?’ I'm afraid I don't remem—   ”

ber names as well as I used to." . .
Nearthe end of the meal, the talk got to the subject of win-
ning. Woody had always been known for his pursuit of victory. ~

"Now, though," he said, "you're asking me if there is any— .1?

thing as important as winning. And I think the answer isyes.
There's something that's more important than winning.” '
I asked him what it was. ' ~ _ .
"There are-some lines by a great orator,” he said. "My dad

used to quote him. He said it better than I ever could: 'And

in the night of death, hope sees a star and listening love hears

o

therustle of a wing."" ,
He was speaking softly.

"You see," he said, "the important thing is not always'_to~‘  

win, the important thing is always to hope." .

When the news came the other day saying Woody had died,  fl

I kept thinking about that night. Most of the world had such
a misconception of him. The words_ kept repeating themselves

in my mind: "And in the night of death, hope sees a star and ‘

listening love hears the rustle of a wing.”

I found myself crying. That surprised, me. I hope he knew how
_ much he meant to me. Your past. has away of disappearing

on you. I'll never forget you, Woody.

' THE PlTl' NEWS, Wednesday, March l8, 1987

Intimes of doubt, remember the chicken avalanche

’’It must have looked like a chicken avalanche,”
said Pa. state trooper Ted Davis. ”Fortunately no
one was hurt.”

”It was just like a movie  feathers were flying
everywhere,” said Davis.

‘Judging from the latest news wire information,
this is not a good time to be a chicken.

It may be an even stranger time to be a truck
driver or a state trooper.

Sorry times indeed. .

If you watch public television, you. must have at
some point seen the sad state of affairs chickens are
raised in. Cooped up all day in the poorly lit chick-
en condos farmers somehow find to be adequate.

State troopers must go from park to 90 ‘mph to
catch speeding travelers. ‘

Truck drivers rumble down the road hour after
hour, hauling as much as possible so as to make
payment on the truck.

“A broken strap on a tractor-trailer sent crates
containing several thousand chickens onto Inter-
state 70, where hundreds of the birds were killed
in-traffic, and the survivors wandered beside the

. road.”

Imagine Ted Davis sitting in his patrol car as the
call came squawking over his radio. ' A _
”Car 27  Car 27  Chicken avalanche on Inter-

LOOKING

BEYOND
nuur KAUFMAN

state 70. Get over there and check it out.”

The state trooper apparently went out to answer
the call. What else could he do? It probably ran
through his mind to pick up the mike and say,
”Get outa town. All right, who's playing with the
radio again?” «

Whatiwould you do?

Or the truck driver cruising down ‘the interstate

. with a load of chickens and looking out to the rear-
1 view mirror. All he can see is white stuff you

would think is snow. ’

Then he realizes it isn't snowing. Then he real-
izes he was carrying a load of chickens.

Whoops.

Think of being behind the truck just before the
feathers flew. The truck's moving at a decent speed,
but you want to pass him anyway. Just as you
reach for the turn signal to begin making your
move, you are swamped by hundreds of chickens.

Do you consider it a message from God telling
you never to pass a trailer-truck? Oral Roberts
would. The Lord speaks in strange ways, right?

Worst of all, imagine being one of the chickens.

Cruising down the highway, the breeze is lightly 

ruffling your feathers. The ride, though bumpy, isn't
as bad as what's coming when you meet the axe
and go to that big coop in the sky.

Then you hear something snap.

- Before you know it, the feathers of your compatri-
ots are flying all around you — only your pals are
no longer attached to them.

If you still have your wits about you, you'll want
to get the heck out of there. Which would lead to
the following if you were a motorist:

Shortly after the disaster, a crazed chicken strolls
up to your car — which has been slowed by the
avalanche of flying feathers — and tries to burn a
ride. _,

If you're humane you open the door and ask him
where he's headed. He'll say Roy Rogers or
Colonel Sanders. ‘ ’

”Oh yeah,” you say. ’’I eat there all thegtime.”
Your companion raises an eyebrow and begins
bobbing and weaving wildly, scanningfor possible

exits in the car. '

”The salads!” you say. ’’I love that salad bar at
Roy Rogers."

Most of the above is strange. What is even
stranger is that some of it actually happened.

‘So, in the event you're bored with your job, sick
of school, or tired of the day-to-day running of your
life, remember the chicken avalanche.

Things could be worse.

Kuntu has aunique approach  

By Frances Sansig
Contributing Editor

The Kuntu Repertory Theater
does not play around.

The theater style is most un-
usual — after each play, there is
a discussion session open to au-
dience participation in the Kun-
tu tradition.

Kuntu, explained cast member
Lee Kiburi, is not an easy concept
to explain. V

”|t’s part ofa whole philosophi-
cal way of life,” said Kiburi. ”|t’s
how artistic expression has mean-
ing in terms of life.”

The theater dates back to 1974,
when it_was founded by Dr. Ver-
nell Lillie, associate professor of
black studies at Pitt. And though
the small production company
presents three plays a year, they

' still suffer from a lack of recog-

nition.

”Our audiences reflect the fact
not enough people know about
us,” said Valerie Lawrence, who
is directing the theater's latest
plays, Pain in My Heart and
Reachings.

Rob Penney, the _playwright_
who penned the two plays, said
his plays are simply written for
”people.”

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

The creation of an under-
graduate business major in the
College of Arts and Sciences is
being opposed by CAS Dean
Irwin Schulman.

Schulman told the CAS
Council yesterday that he is
currently studying the pros
and cons’ of allowing CAS stu-
dents to major in business.
Presently, CAS students can
obtain a bachelor's degree in
business, but only if they pur-
sue a double ‘major that in-
cludes a discipline from the

, College of Arts and Sciences.

”l’m hostile to the idea of al-
lowing CAS students [to]
major in only business, on the-
oretical and practical
grounds,” Schulman said. ’’I

Dean opposed to  
new business ma/or

oppose the university's mov-
ing in a vocational direction.”

To keep the CAS on-an aca-
demic course, Schulman said
-he hopes to add courses that 0
will help students to intergrate
what they've learned.

”Present requirements,” he
said, ”require students to take
elementary work in a variety
of fields. Unlike other schools,
though, we don't offer broad-
based courses which pull
together things from a variety
of disciplines.” .

Schulman told the -CAS
Council that he hopes to retire
by July 1 and that the search
for ‘his successor is ‘nearly
complete.

”The search committee for
my successor has picked
finalists,” Schulman said. ”The
whole process should be com-

Pittto sponsor Clean WaterAction symposium

By Christopher L. Wells

For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh branch of the
Clean Water Action Project is
planning a ”Citizen Campaign
Skills” seminar to be held on
March 23 at 7:30 in Room 1M56
of Forbes Quadrangle

”The main thrust of the semi-
nar is learning the skills of cam-
paign management,” said Myles

Hoenig, staff director of the Clean
Water Action Project, a national
grassroots organization designed
to improve the quality of water in
community life.

The seminar will feature David
Zwick, executive director of
CWAP. Zwick co—authored the
1972 Clean Water Act, a land-
mark legislation credited with
cleaning up the nation's water-
ways. Zwick worked with con-

in February, CWAP won
amendments to the Clean Water

al override of President Reagan's

”We act as a canvas to contact

He added that it's the citizens
themselves, rather than separate
lobbyists, who pressure represen-
tatives in enviornmental commit-
tees to get things done.

is focusing on in Pittsburgh is pro-

Interest In

Jazz is on

the, rise in

Pittsburgh

For The Pitt News

Many people consider Pitt's
area of excellence-to be sports.
Some would say medicine, or
that Pitt is noted as a research
university. Few, if any, would an-
swer jazz. 4 .

Nathan Davis, director of jazz
studies, hopes to change all of

‘ that with the newest contribution

to the university — the Interna-
tional Academy of Jazz Hall of
Fame, which is located on the
main floor of the William Pitt.
Union. -

The Hall of Fame was con-

structed to recognize the contri-
butions of world-renowned jazz
musicians. _
According to Davis, jazz is
America's most unique contribu-
tion to the world, and by having

-a hall of fame, ”we as a universi-

ty are recognizing this contri-

bution.” » ‘

Davis said that compared to
other universities ' across the
country, Pitt is considered one of
the leaders in jazz, and that Pitt
is_the very first university in the
world to have a jazz hall of fame,_
which is documented in the Los

- Angeles Times.

One-of the most difficult parts
of trying to get this hall of fame
established was trying to get the
renowned musicians to part with
their instruments, said Davis.

”Pittsburgh, for a- city its size,
has produced more jazz innova-
tors than any other city,” said
Davis.

The money to build the hall of
fame came mostly from dona-
tions and from various student ac-
tivities. - ‘

”lt’s something that the stu-
dents should really be proud of.
The American students should
really take a look at this hall of
fame, because when you go out-
side of this country, people say
America is reeking with jazz all
over the place,” said Davis.

Once it is publicized, people

other professors] went to the
countryside to work in the
farms.” -

Lin continued to study while at
the farm. ”The idea was to iden-
tify ourselves with the peasant,”
he said. ”When I think back, it
was a wonderful way. Without
the combination of studying and
working on the farm, I could not
have established myself here in
America.”

The work is hard here, he
added. ”When I came to Pitts-
burgh, I established an office in
my home, where I also did
acupuncture on my friends. Then
I started teaching massage for two

semesters at Pitt. I also taught Tai

semesters, and I still teach that,”
he said.

HARRISBURG —— Gov. Robert

P. Casey said Tuesday his legis— _

lative proposal to try*to end a Li-
quor Control Board impasse will
be ready ”very, very soon.”

In an informal interview in his

- office, the governor said the

proposal will reflect a consensus
of 'positions that a number of
legislators and officials have dis-
cussed with the Democrat’s ad-
ministration.

Chinese massage relief for pain

Massage Therapy Association,
Inc., a nationwide organization
that has between 4,000 and
5,000 members. His specialty is
treating back pain and knee and
shoulder aches caused by
bursitis.

”People who suffer from this
can hardly raise their arms. Some-
times even the pain keeps them
awake. I understand a lot of peo-
ple have bad backs in this coun-
try,” said Lin.

Lin said patients’ reactions
range from amazement to fright.

”There_are two steps to my
therapy. First, I massage all the
muscles related to the particular
joint that is ailing. That takes
roughly a half hour. I use a heat
lamp to warm and relax the mus-
cles. Then, I manipulate the joint
—— that is, exercising the joint. I
move it in different ways,” said

broad support for continuation of
the system with some changes.”

The fate of the Liquor Control
Board, which has a monopoly on
wholesale and retail liquor sales
and is also responsible for licens-
ing and enforcement, has‘ been
uncertain since the end of. the
1985-86 legislative term. At that
point, the General Assembly
failed to approve a measure that

would extend the agency's life,

beyond the end of 1986.

Under the state's Sunset Law,
the failure to act meant the LCB
had to take steps ‘to disband by
June 30. Casey's bill is one of a
number of proposals being
worked up to extend the LCB, in
some form, beyond the Sunset
deadline.

Lin.

According to Lin, massaging is
a vigorous job. He said that he
will often be sweating at the end
of a session.

”It’s great fun, though. I _did
help a lot of people,” he said.

Lin said he has been massaging
for over 15 years. In addition to
Pitt, he has also taught at the Pitts-

burgh Massage Therapy Center, '-

Inc. and before that, at the San
Francisco College of Acupunc-
ture and Oriental Medicine.

’’I want to teach more people
here so they can do this for the
people of Pittsburgh. At this
point, I'm the only one doing
traditional Chinese massage,”

I said Lin.

Lin said he hopes to return to
China this May to study and teach

A so he can learn more about his ‘

craft. *

Governor plans to endLCB soon

Although Casey has not dis-
cussed specifics of the plan, the
administration is expected to pro-
pose transferring some enforce-
ment powers to another agency.
Drafts of LCB bills by lawmakers
take the same approach, with
some calling for enforcement to
be placed with the state police
and some putting it with the at-
torney general.

During last year's gubernatori-
al campaign, Casey said he fa-
vored some consumer-oriented
changes,. but_ it is not known if

‘they will be-contained in‘ his

legislation._

In the interview, Casey said the
administration hasn't decided
whether his proposals will be in-

Bergen County garage scene of another suicide  

By Michael Fleeman

Associated Press Writer,

BERGENFIELD, N.J. — A
young couple was found dazed
but conscious after breathing car
fumes today in the same garage
where last week four youths, in-
cluding a teen—ager they knew,
died in a suicide pact, police said.

A suicide note was found, but
the couple's car had been turned
off, police said.

Please see editorial, page 4

Meanwhile, in the Chicago
suburb of Rolling Meadows, |l|.,
authorities said a 14-year-old boy
who died from inhaling auto ex-
haust patterned his death after re-
cent suicides he had read about.
His death was ruled a suicide, but
the boy's family maintained it
was accidental.

The 20-year-old woman and
her 17-year-old boyfriend, both
from other towns, were disco-
vered after a police officer patroll-
ing the Bergenfield apartment
complex at 4:06 a.m. noticed the
garage’s padlock- had been
broken, said police Chief Willard
Burkart.

The woman was handcuffed to

the steering wheel of a Camaro,
the same model as the car in
which the four youths died, Bur-
kart said. Borough administrator
Louis Goetting said the young
woman had a history of suicide
attempts, and indicated later she
wanted to make a rescue more
difficult.

The car's motor was not run-
ning, but was warm when police
discovered the two, the chief
said. The two told rescuers they
had turned off the motor when
they heard someone outside the

look for in a man can also be found
in a foilpack of condoms.

They're an extremely effective way
to prevent pregnancy Especially when
they're used with contraceptive foam.

They're fun to put on. if you use

And they make a fantastic gift for
that special occasion when words...

You can get them at any drugstore

Rambling suicide notes were
found in the car. Authorities
would -not detail their contents
other than to say there was no
specific mention of last week's
deaths.

Also found in the car were a
35—mm camera, a leather jacket,
a plastic bag, a looseleaf binder,
a spiral notebook and six beer
bottles.

The two had gone through Ber-
genfield schools, and knew Tho-
mas Rizzo, 19, who died in the
garage last Wednesday, Goetting
said.

The two were committed to a
hospital's psychiatric division.

”Our reaction is just disbelief,”
said Goetting. ”We are grateful
we were successful in averting
another tragedy.

Eddie Rigel, manager of a near-
by gas station, said young people
had been gathering at the garage
since the deaths last week. He
said some knelt and prayed and
he feared it was being turned
”into some kind of shrine.”

”We are very alert on what’s
been happening and what is hap-

pening in Bergenfield. We have
increased our patrols among
juveniles,” Burkart said.

’’All we can ask of the parents
if they notice any change in their
juveniles, any change at all, try to
get help.” .

Mental health experts ”have
said that there will be copy—cat
types of suicides. They said that
we have to be on our toes and
watch for it,” the chief said.

Meanwhile, a 20-year-old
Clifton man committed suicide
Monday by inhaling fumes from
a car's engine in the family
garage, but police said that case
did not appear to be linked to the
other suicides. .

After the deaths last week in
Bergenfield of two boys and two
girls, two young women in
another Chicago suburb killed
themselves by the same method,
carbon monoxide poisoning.

Police in Rolling Meadows said
newspaper clippings about those
suicides were ‘discovered under
Kevin Pyter’s bed after his body
was found in the family's closed
garage Saturday night.

An autopsy indicated the death

was a suicide, said Dr. Edmund
Donoghue Jr., who performed
the examination. '

”He died of carbon monoxide
intoxication, due to the inhala-

tion of auto exhaust fumes,”4

Donoghue said Monday night.

Illiterate teen sues former high school

By Arlene Levinson
Associated Press Writer I

BOSTON —— A school district
that awarded a high school diplo-
ma to a woman who could not
read but cheated her way to the
top of the class has been ordered
to pay $17,000 she spent for
remedial education.

Karen Morse, who is dyslexic,
is in college now, but to people
in her hometown of Henniker,
N.H., her high school education
is very much a current issue.

School board members will not
say if they will appeal the March
3 ruling by the New Hampshire
Department of Education order-
ing payment for the special’
school Morse. attended after high
school.

They have 30 days to respond
but the matter is expected to

come up and could be decided
Wednesday at a town meeting.

”We’ll wait to see if the town
feels strongly to go one way or
the other,” said school board
member Bob Konze. He said the

board members have ”pretty

much made up our minds.”

Wednesday's meeting will de-
cide the school district budget for
next year. While Konze refused
to disclose which way the board
is leaning on the Morse matter,
he said they expect to ask for
$17,000 to be tacked onto the
budget as ”an unforeseen special
education expense.”

Morse, 20, a freshman at Salem
State College, said ”a few people
in our town” of 3,100 have indi-
cated they are not happy with the
decision. But she is savoring her
victory.

”It’s a big decision for special

education,’ she said in a tele-

phone interview Tuesday from

her Massachusetts college. The
ruling, "she said, ”should make
school districts think twice.”

In ninth grade Morse was diag-
nosed as learning disabled. But it
was two years more before her
problem was identified as dyslex-
ia, an impairment in the ability to
identify letters and words.

For nine years she had hidden .

from teachers and friends her in-
ability to read. She carried on her
charade by cheating, mostly by
taking papers from other pupils
and erasing their names, she said.

Her ruse succeeded. She was
elected president of her senior
class, president of the student
council and to the National
Honor Society. She was captain

of the girl's soccer team, won let—7

ters in two other sports and was
voted the student with the ”most
school spirit.”

It wasn't until her senior year
that she received any remedial
help, Ms‘. Morse said. That year

she was assigned a tutor.

She gave a speech at high
school graduation in 1984 but re-
fused to accept a diploma or for-
mally graduate in an effort to get
Henniker High School to pay her
tuition at ‘Landmark School in
Beverly, which specializes in
teaching dyslexics.

After a year at Landmark, the
school recommended she spend
another year there to prepare for
college. However, Henniker’s
new superintendent refused to
pay for further education and
mailed Morse her diploma. ,

Now Alice Vartanian, a hearing
officer for New Hampshire's
Department of Education, has or-
dered Henniker to pay tuition for
the second year. She also instruct-
ed the school district to re-
examine its process of determin-
ing when special education is re-
quired.

In the meantime, Morse has
been enjoying college, where she
is studying elementary education.
”I did pretty well in my first
semester,” she said.

THE PITT NEWS

So Charles Smith wants to go
to the NBA?

Well, let me clarify that. Smith
hasn't said whether or not he in-
tends to declare himself eligible
for the June's NBA draft.

But the fact that he hasn't
decided indicates that Smith, a
junior, is considering it.

‘Quite simply, for Pitt's sake,
Smith's decision will be the
difference between the Panthers
being a legitimate preseason Top
Five team next year and a border-
line Top 20 team. »
i There is no doubt that the
money and attention that go

_ along with playing in the NBA

are mighty tempting for any play-

er. Smith is no exception.

But what is the sense of play-
ing in the NBA if you're not ‘go-
ing to be at your optimum‘
performance level?

That is Smith's situation. He
isn't primed and ready for the
night in, night out rigors of pro
basketball. Marty Blake, NBA

scouting director, doesn't think so

either. ”Smith should stay in
school, and you can quote me on
that,” Blake said over the phone
from his Atlanta office yesterday.

Granted, Smith possesses all
the tools. He is as quick as any
6-10 player in the country. He is

' strong. He can block shots. He

can shoot outside. He can pass.

JOHN
ENRIG-H'l'

He can put the ball on the floor.

He's not ready.

Why?

Well, let’s start with basics.
First, Smith fouled out of nine
games this year. Some calls
against him have been question-
able, and Pitt coach Paul Evans
has had his share of complaints
with officials, but still, there's no
excuse for a junior with Smith's
experience to be in so much foul
trouble.

‘I3

Wednesday, March 18, .1987

Turning pro isn't way for Pitt big man togo

Smith still has some bad habits
on defense, and heneeds another
year to eliminate them.

Secondly, Smith has no out-

1 standing characteristic to offer an

NBA team. Think about it. He
does everything well, but nothing
extraordinary. It is a Catch-22.
‘His all-around skills will land him
a spotin the NBA, but does he
have one particular ability right

now that would make him a star? '

I don't think so.

Smith would be better off stay-
ing his senior year and gaining
more experience. He would
probably continue to play center,
and, although he'll be an NBA
power forward, he could add

Speculation continues to cir-
culate that Charles Smith may
forfeit his senior year of eligi-
bility at Pitt and enter June's
National Basketball Associa-
tion draft.

’ One man ‘who holds a
strong voice thinks that the
6-10 center/forward would be
making a big mistake. ”He’s
not ready. He should stay in
school,” said Marty Blake,
director of NBA scouting.

. He's not ready. He
should sta yin school.
Charles Smith is not
ready toplay in our
league. .

— Marty Blake

Some feel the talented Smith
would be drafted high in the
first round. Blake wouldn't dis-
cuss that, though, because
Smith is an underclassman.
Blake said he will not com-
ment on any underclassman’s
chances in the NBA". V

However, Blake added,
”Charles Smith is not ready to
play in-our league.”

Smith averaged 17 points
and 8.5 rebounds a game
while blocking 106 shots for
the 25-8 Panthers.

Smith isn't the only Pitt play-
er who has been the center of
NBA controversy. Last month,
it was speculated that Jerome
Lane's‘ mother had contacted
an agent about -this _year’s
draft, Lane denied that report.

The 6-6 sophomore power
forward was the nation's lead-
ing rebounder this season with
13.5 rebounds per game,
while ‘§coringl'15t8 points per 
contest.

When Blake was asked what
he thought of Lane possibly
going to the NBA this year, he
said, ”What? He wants ‘to
come out. That's ridiculous/r’. _

Smith and Lane were first
team All-Big East selections
this year, and Lane was a third
team Associated Press. All-
America. ‘

Last year twolBig East stars
—- Pearl Washington of Syra-
cuse and Walter Berry of-St.
John's — left school a year ear- _
ly for the NBA. _

But both players have strug-
gled in their first year in the
league.'Washington has start-
ed off and on at point guard for
the New Jersey Nets, while
Berry has already been traded

Blazers to the San Antonio
Spurs. . ‘ .-

Phillies not hopeful in searchforl pitching.

' By Ralph Bernstein

AP Sports Writer

CLEARWATER, Fla. — The

6 Philadelphia Phillies have talked

with several clubs in their quest
for. a starting pitcher and left-hand
‘reliever, but they are not optimis-
tic about finding’ them.
”Everybody seems to be look-
ing for the same thing, a starter
and a left-hand reliever,” Phillies
“President Bill Giles said Monday
before an exhibition game against

the Boston Red Sox.

Giles said the Los Angeles

-Dodgers were in the market for
‘ a centerfielder, of which the; Phil-.»

lies have three. _

”But the Dodgers don't have '
-the pitching we want,” he .

hastened to add. ”We’re not
close to anything, but_it's early
yet.” ' 

Giles wouldn't mention names,
but the club tried to trade Gary
Redus all winter. ’

ManagerJohn Felske has given
Milt Thompson the center field
job in spring training, but Redus
and Jeff Stoneare competing.

Thompson isn't available now,

- but Redus and Stone are availa-

ble -for the right trade—— _especia|-

fly Stone,.,wh,o:in..-th,e eyes of they],
.‘_o_r_gani»zation ‘has fallenvishort. of’ 1

his potential.
Redus was on the disabled list
for more than two_ months last

‘year and hit .247 in 90 games.

Stone started the 1986 season at
Portland and returned to hit .227‘
in 82 NL games. .
Thompson opened in center
field last season, hit .207 in 53
games and was optioned to Tri-

. ple A. He returned amonth later

and hit..297 in 40 games.
Meanwhile, indicationsare that

Steve Carlton has one more 0

chance to impress Felske and the ‘

Phillies’ brass. At the moment, J
;,the four-time Cy Young Award

winner figures -to be dropped.

He's worked in three games
and allowed nine hits and seven
runs (four earned) in nine, innings.
He walked three and struck out

. one.

Felske keeps noting after
Carlton outings that the pitcher
doesn't have consistent velocity.
Felske said Monday that Carlton

. would pitch against the St. Louis

Cardinals Friday and a decision
would be made on whether to
keep him.

Giles, on theadvice of Felske
and pitching coach Claude Os-
teen, decided to give Carlton a

That is where Smith has a
minor problem — his offensive
game. Watching him play"all
year, one notices that Smith
scores his points in three ways — .
dunks, 15-foot jumpers and foul
shots. ' :
But he still hasn't proved that
he can hit the 6- to 8-foot turna-
round jumper in the lane in
somebody’s face. ' _

No more patsies as 16 teams vie fortitle

So the dust has been cleared,
and the NCAA Tournament is
now an underdogless Gang of
16. Where have all the sleepers,
the Rip Van Winkles, gone?

Well, they've gone home and
rather quickly at that. Aside from
an unexpected run by the "Home
on the Range” Wyoming Cow-

“boys in the West Regional, there

are really no Sneaky Petes
who've snuck their way into the
third round of play. That is, un-
less you consider more than one
tournament victory by a Notre
Dame team the closest thing to a
miracle since  since  Austin
Peay dunked Illinois??? Or South-
west Missouri State tripped
Clemson???

Yeah, but that is old news.
Austin Peay (as in The—Who’s—He-

» From—Tennessee?) ran into Provi-

dence and a six-shooter named
Billy "The Kid” Donovan. And
Kansas’ Danny Manning just hap-
pened to have his most produc-
tive outing ever (42 points) in the
Jayhawks victory of the SW
Mizzou.

 
   
  

The NCAA Tournament is now
down to business — just the big
boys slugging it out among them-
selves. No more funny stuff from
you guys that nobody’s ever
heard of. But thanks anyway — it
was fun while it lasted.

The East Regional — North
Carolina is where everybody and
his brother predicted they'd be,
but only because the competition
would have a hard time beating
anybody and his sister. Al
McGuire proclaims this is the
best UNC team ever. C’mon Al

— what about the '82 dynamo .

that had Worthy and Perkins and
Jordan? That club was the abso-
lute juggernaut. This year's Caro-
lina squad has lost to UCLA, N.C.
State and  '

Notre Dame. Haven't heard

that name this far into March in '

a while, huh? Digger Phelps’ out-
fit ran past Middle Tennessee and
TCU — teams that in past years
would have somehow wiggled
their way by the Irish. Not this
time around. Notre Dame is for
real or at least a reasonable fac-
simile.

Florida and Syracuse? You try

Florida struggled with meek N.C.
State then trounced highly-ranked
Purdue. ‘If you're betting this
game, pick the winner then put
your money on the other team.
Why not? It makes about as much
sense as either Florida or Syra-
cuse does.

Holy Hoyas, Batman! How does
Georgetown keep pulling out
these long—lost games? They get
themselves behind by a whole
bunch in the first half, then bomb

and break and press their way

back into it — that's how! But

-how long can this "year of living

dangerously” last?

Ohio State coach Gary Wil-
liams must wonder. On Sunday,

he had his Buckeyes up by 15 at
one point in the second half
against the Hoyas — and lost. The
sense is that Georgetown —
which has won 13 straight — be-
sides being good, is lucky. You
know, carrying the coveted rab-
bit's foot. Look for John Thomp-
son's troops to derail Kansas, then
outslug Alabama to win the
Southeast.

The Midwest Regional — Bob-
by Knight's Indiana team has got
it in high gear. After dismantling
stingy Auburn, the Hoosiers must
now take onvDuke, last year's
finalist. Knight hasn't waltzed in
the Grand Ball for six years, so he
and his defense's dancing feet are
ready for a little bit of soft sho
on the hard court. -

DePaul pulled one out of their
Dallas [Comegys] in squeaking
past St. John's on Sunday. But that
win was, more or less, a product
of their Horizon home—court ad-
vantage. Now the Blue Demons

must travel to Cincinnati for a _

And Smith may want to get out
just so he will no longer have to

‘deal with double and triple team

defenses, something he faced all
season long.

"You have to double and triple
team Charles Smith, or he'll kill
you," said Syracuse coach Jim
Boeheim. I

St. John's almost did. Redmen"
big men Marco Baldi and Terry
Bross hammered Smith in both
games Pitt played against St.
John's this year, frustrating him
into two poor scoring perfor-
mances. St. John's won both
games. .

But the bottom line is that the
decision is Smith's and no one
else’s. It is his choice whether to
leave for the NBA or not. One
would think he would also bring
into consideration two points of
interest: First, if Smith returns for
his senior year, the Panthers
could be bona fide contenders for
a national championship next
season. Second, if Smith leaves,
he would lose his amateur status

Considering Smith's stellar play

that indeed occurred, Smith

Three Panther wrestlers going to

By Vince Carey

Staff Writer

Starting tomorrow at 10 a.m.,
three Pitt wrestlers will begin
their quest for excellence as the
NCAA Championships get under
way at Cole Field House on the
University of Maryland campus.

Sophomore 142-pound Pat
Santoro and seniors Eric Wertz
(167) and Gary Bolin (158) quali-
fied for the NCAA Champion-
ships two weeks ago at the
Eastern Wrestling League Tour-
nament.

Pitt wrestling coach Rande

Gary Bolin has been to the NCAA championships before...

Stottlemyer likes his wrestlers’
Chances. ”l think that they all
have a good chance at winning,”
said Stottlemyer. ”Pat probably
has the best chance, but don't
Count the other guys out. I have
a feeling that Eric and Gary are
going to surprise a lot of people.”

Santoro, who attained All-

America status last year, is Cur-

rently ranked No. 2 at the
142-division and is used to the
Competition. ”Pat has wrestled
the top wrestlers in the division
before, so he knows what they
are like,” said. Stottlemyer.
One of the tougher weight

classes in the country is the
142-pound Class, so Santoro will

have his work Cut out for him.

There are a number of wrestlers
who Could win the title, includ-
ing Creg Randell of Oklahoma
State and Pete Yazzo of Lehigh
University. -~

’’I can forsee Pat facing Yazzo
in the semifinals,” said Stott-
lemyer. ’’I truly believe that the
winner of that match will take
home the championship.”

Bolin, who competed at the
NCAAs two years ago, has an
equally tough Challenge ahead at
150—pounds. Somewhere along

the line he will have to face No.
1-ranked Glenn Hetferman.

’’Gary has been here before, so I

he knows what it is like,” said
Stottlemyer. ”He really hasn't
had the Chance to wrestle the top-
ranked people before, but he will
wrestle his hardest.”

Meanwhile, this is Wertz’s first
time at the NCAAs, and that
might be his only problem. He
has wrestled well all year and
doesn't want his season to end on
a bad note.

”EriC has the same problem
that Gary has,” said Stottlemyer.
”He hasn't had the chance to
wrestle the upper—ranked wres-
tlers at all.”

Although, Wertz has squared
off with No. 1-ranked Rob Cole.
Earlier in the year, he faced Cole
and fought him hard before los-
ing 4-2. Wertz could verywell be
the surprise of the tournament.

The competition that lies ahead
for Santoro, Bolin and Wertz is
very tough, but Stottlemyer ex-
pects positive results out of that
threesome. ”l have never been to
an Olympics, but I think that this
is the best tournament in the
world,” said Stottlemyer. ”The
guys have worked hard and are
ready. I'm looking for good things
out of them.”

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 18, I987 _

Men's tennis team starting off slow at 1-4

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

Even though it is very early in
the season, the Pitt men's tennis
team is only 1 and 4 after play-
ing a full weekend of tennis
against the University of Rich-
mond, the_U.S. Naval Academy
and Howard University.

The team entered play last
weekend 0 and 2 after being
defeated 8-1 by both Penn State
and Cornell. Panther senior Dave
Johnson was the only Pitt player
able to pull out a match in either

’ game against these two tennis

giants. -

The Panthers’ weekend started
with an away match against the
University of Richmond on Fri-
day. The Panthers hadn't played
the Richmond Spiders since

133i‘-'iF'F'|3lHTEE| HE.

1977. However, Pitt knew to ex-
pect top-notch play from them.

Their expectations proved to be
correct. The Spiders played ex-
ceptionally well and shut Pitt out
9-0.

Pitt senior Dave Johnson bat-
tled Richmond's Scott Bembelis
for three close sets in the No. 4
singles match. Bembelis was vic-
torious in the end, though, win-
ning 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Pitt's No. 3 singles player,
junior Greg Campbell, was suffer-
ing from a strained hand liga-
ment, so he played in the No. 6
singles spot for the Panthers
against Richmond.

Campbell played a competitive
match against Richmond's Bran-
don Carrey, going on for three
close sets. Carrey won 6-3, 4-6,
7-6. -

Pitt tennis coach George
Diffenbach is not really disap-
pointed when his. team loses
matches against tough teams
such as Richmond. He explained
his reason for scheduling such
tough opponents.

’’I thought we had a good
showing against the University of
Richmond, even though we were
unable to pull out any matches,”
said Diffenbach. ”This season's
schedule is the toughest in the
history of tennis here at Pitt. I
planned the tough schedule for a
reason. Mainly I wanted to give
the seniors, who have worked
hard for four years, the opportu-
nity to play well against the best
players in the East. The tough
schedule this season willgive
them a chance to prove them-
selves and gorout in style.”

On Saturday, the Panthers"

played two matches back to
back. First they traveled to the
U.S. Navel Academy, where they
were defeated 8-1.

Campbell moved back into the
No. 3 singles spot for Pitt in this
meet because his injury was not
bothering him as much as it had
the previous day, and, conse-
quently, he had an outstanding
match against the Midshipmen’s
Graham Rogers. He won in three

sets, 6-2, 0-6, 7-5. _

’’I played the best tennis I have
ever played in the match against
Rogers,” said Campbell. ”Every-
thing came together for me in the
match. I think playing a good
match in the No. 6 singles spot
the day before really helped my
confidence. Having a big win like
this under my belt will give me
a more positive attitude in facing
the tougher schools on our sched-
ule this season.”

After completing the match"

against Navy, the Panthers hard-
ly hadtime to catch their breath
before they traveled to Washing-
ton to play a match that same af-
ternoon against Howard.

This match provided the Pan-
thers with their first win of the
season. The Panthers defeated the
Bisons 7-2.

Early on, things did not look
good for Pitt after the No. 1 and
2 singles matches were over. The
Panthers were down by two
when their No. 1 singles player,
Neil Meyerowich, lost a close
match, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, to Ken Lee
of Howard. The Panthers’ No. 2
singles player, Paul Maben, also
dropped a close match, 7-6, 3-6,
7-6, to Howard's Robert Bryant.

But the Panthers came back
strong, winning all of the remain-

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's diving team had
a strong team showing last

in . weekend at the NCAA pre-

qualifying meet at the Naval
‘Academy in Annapolis, Md., as
four divers finished in the top 10.

The individual competition
was tough, but no other school

possessed the depth that the Pitt
diving team displayed. Pitt was
the only team to place more than
one diver in the top 10.

”I was very happy with all our
divers’ performances at the
NCAA pre-qualifying meet,” said
Pitt diving coach Julian Krug. ”It
was without a doubt the best and
most competitive qualifying meet
this region has ever seen.”

Pitt senior lack Shuten dove ex-
tremely well against the top com-
petition, capturing first place in
the I=meter diving competition
and third place in the 3-meter
diving competition. In addition,
Shuten qualified for the NCAA
championship meet on both
boards.

Shuten’s first-place finish in the
I—meter diving competition was
somewhat of a surprise, since he
has traditionally considered the
one-meter diving competition to
be his weaker event and the

-3-meter diving competition to be

his stronger.

”|.expected to dive better on
3-meter than on I—meter,” said
Shuten. ”I’m glad to have quali-

fied for the NCAA Champion-

ships on both boards.  We went

‘into the competition with a good

attitude, a lot of confidence and

dove our best.

”There was a lot of pressure in
the 3-meter diving competition
though, especially for Chris Blair
since he had just missed qualify-
ing for the NCAA Championships
in the I—meter competition,” con-
tinued Shuten. ’’I really wanted
Chris to make_it.”

Blair, a junior, was disappoint-
ed with the outcome of the meet.
Blair dove very well in the
"I—meter competition and just
missed qualifying for the NCAA
Championships by four points,
finishing in fifth place.

Blair favored the 3-meter com-
petition as his stronger event. He

‘went into the competition unsure
of what to expect after a good
round of dives in the I-meter
competition.

third dive, he overcorrected a bad
‘take-off, hitting the board when
he pulled in too closely. ”When
I hit the board on my third dive,
it totally wrecked my confi-
dence,” said Blair. ”I’m very dis-
appointed that I did not make the
NCAA Championships because I
wanted the experience and the
exposure this year. This does not
set me back, though; it only rear-
ranges my goals. I was glad to
pull myself out of the hole and
finish strongly.” ,

Blair was in 17th place, but af-
ter executing a round of good
dives, he moved up and finished
in seventh place. .

Panther freshman John Sharky
and sophomore Vernon Yenick
also performed strongly at the
NCAA pre-qualifying meet. Shar-
key captured 12th place in the
I—meter competition, as well as
ninth place in the 3-meter com-
petition.

Yenick placed right behind
Sharkey on both boards, finishing

‘ 13th in the I-meter competition
and 10th in the 3-meter compe-_
tition.

Sophomore Margie Paullick
placed highest for the Panthers on
the women's diving front. Paul-
lick captured 10th place in the
I—meter competition and 12th in
the 3-meter competition. Paullick
went into the meet with high ex-
pectations and came out of it dis-
appointed. ’-/This meet was a total
disappointment for me,” said

V Paullick. ”This meet was the

main focus of my training this
season, and it was very disap-
: pointing when I didn't dive-we'll.
The disappointment, ‘though, will
make me work harder next
season.” ,
Freshman Candy Yackmack

' made a strong showing in her first

trip to the meet. Out of a field of
34 divers, r-Yackmack finished
22nd and 12th in the 1- and
3-meter, diving competitions,
repectively. .

Lady -Panther divers Cathy
McDonnel and Shelly Bowser
did not make the trip to the
NCAA pre-qualifying meet due to
illness and family obligations. '

Although the Pitt diving team
qualified only one diver this year
for the NCAA Diving Champion-
ships, theirchances are good for
qualifying more divers next year,

”We have three strong divers
returning next season,” said Krug.
”Our depth will be hard to beat.”

There was a time in Bob Wein-
er’s life when track was just
another form of exercise.

’’Basically, I started running to
get in shape for baseball, basket-
ball and soccer,” said Weiner. ”It
was just something else to do..”

Luckily for_Pitt, Weiner ex-

, celled in track and has proven

that it was the right move.

Last weekend, team senior tri-
captain Weiner, along with-
2—mile relay teammates Joe
Daniels, Tim Manes and Dave
Moore, set the American and col-
"le'3$9. 5°‘? Welt‘.-9?’. "i°.3‘?.=,-19. I A

legiate record in the NCAA Track
and Field Championships in Ok-

I lahoma City. Their time of 7:20.2

was broken only minutes later by
Arkansas, Indiana and Geor-
getown.

With this performance, their

-fourth-place finish gave them

their second consecutive All-
America status.

But Weiner wanted more than
that.

”We were All-Americans last
year, and this year we really
wanted to win,” added Weiner.

Some of Weiner’s other
achievements include All-Big
East, the Big East championship
in the 1,000 meters and the
school record holder in the out-
door 4 x 1600 meter relay. Wein
er, Daniels, Mickey Rihtarchik

‘ THE Pm NEWS, Wednesday, March «is, 1937

and Scott Abel set the record in
1985 with a time of 17:11.5.
Before coming to Pitt, Weiner,
a graduate of Mt. Lebanon High
School, went to Western Acade-
my in Worchester, Mass., for
post-graduate work from high

school. He left a year later and ’

turned his thoughts to Pitt.

’’I knew that the track program
was on the way up and was look-
ing toward law school,” said
Weiner. ’’It was convienent for
leaving prep school, and I had the
freedom of going home or not.”

Since coming to Pitt, Weiner
has won the respect of not only
the coach but of the entire team.

”Bob is probably one of the
hardest workers on the team,”
said men's track coach John Vas-
vary. ”He’s given a lot of good
leadership on and off the track.

He's given the younger guys
something to look up to, and they

‘ do look up to Bob. When they

get nervous or worried, Bob's
been a lot of help.”

”Bob is incredible with the stuff
he does,” said Manes, who is
also a member of the 2-mile re-
lay. ”There are not too many peo-
ple in the country stronger than
him, based on the things he's run
and how he does it.

”To show you what he's capa-
ble of doing, once, in the middle
of a workout, he ran a 1:52 [half-
mile]. Most people in the coun-
try have trouble doing that in a
race,” added Manes.

This type of dedication is what
helped propel the Panthers to win
the Big East Track and Field

Championships.

”It was probably_one of the

most thrilling things for the
team,” said Weiner. ”lt’s like
UCLA basketball in the 1970s —
one of the best in the country. It
was quite an accomplishment.”

Weiner, a political science/
pre-law major, is a very versatile
runner. Indoors, he usually runs
the 1,000—meters, the mile and
the 2-mile relay. Outdoors, he'll
probably run the mile, the dis-
tance medley and the 2-mile re-
lay. And for the Big East, it's
usually the 1,500-meter run.

It seems Weiner is a jack-of-all-
trades, and Vasvary recognizes
that.

’’If we're ever in need of some-
one in a relay, we went to Bob,”
Vasvarysaid. ”You can't always
measure out what he's done —
’He’s done this, and he's done

that.’ He does the intangibles. 0

He's done a lot.”
”If I was looking for someone

to do something hard, it would

be Bob,” said Manes.

When the pressures of the
classroom and track get to be a
little much to Weiner, he enjoys
socializing, playing golf and
water skiing. As for now,
however, he is looking forward to
the outdoor'track season.

’’I would like to win [the] out-
door [championships] as a team
and would like to qualify in-
dividually in the mile," said
Weiner.

Vasvary can appreciate all of ‘

Weiner’s efforts, both in the class-
room and on the track. . '

”Bob is an excellent student.
He is all the things you as a coach

would like in a runner,” added 6

Vasvary.

s anish champ Hummell nowdoes his running for Pitt

Lars Hummell

By Matt O'Hara _
Staff Writer 0

Previously the fastest man in
Denmark, world track standout
Lars Hummell is now the second
fastest man at Pitt. '

Aside from anchoring Den-
mark’s unofficial world record
holding 44100 meter relay, Hum-
mell is the Danish national record
holder in the 60- (6.70) and
100-meter (10.2) dashes, as well
as, the long jump (26’3”).

”The most obvious reason I
came here was to run with Lee
McRae,” Hummell said. ”Run-
ning with Lee is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.
He's not just a great runner, but

- ‘he's got a great personality, too.” -

Currently, Hummell is unable
to compete for Pitt because of

_ NCAA eligibility rules. Next year,

however, he wants to ”do any-
thing” the coaches ask him to do.

At the World Indoor Track’

Championships held March 6-8

in the Hoosier Dome in Indi-
anapolis, Hummell did not get
into the final heat and was disap-
pointed with his performance. He
accredits this to a bad start.

”|’ve had problems with my
starts, but I'm getting much bet-
ter,-'.’ he said. ”Working with Lee
and Coach Lewis has really
helped me.”

Hummell looks forward to
competing in the 1988 Olympics
for Denmark but is not sure
which events he will participate
in.

’’It depends on what Coach
Lewis has me working on,” he

added. ’’I love the sprints; that's '

what |'want to do most.”
Olympic qualifying time in the

. 100-meter run  -110:1 — seconds.

Hummell’s best time to date is
10.2. ”|’rﬁ real positive about my
chances. I'm sure I'll be able to
get that time down,” he said.
Hummell looks forward to

Tarosky’s upbeat attitude keys his success

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

Senior Dan Tarosky, a member
of the Pitt men's gymnastics team,
has such a positive outlook
towards life, many people could
learn from him.

Tarosky got started in gymnas-
tics when he was in eighth grade.
”My phys. ed. coach, Demeree
Answine, noticed that I had some
athletic ability and asked me if I
would like to try out for the gym-

nastics team. He taught me how

to have a good disciplined work
“ethic,” said Tarosky.
’ .Tarosky is now trying to get a

 

back and compete next season
because he fractured his shoulder
his freshman year and was una-
ble to compete. ”With a little bit
of luck and if I'm still healthy, I'll
be back,” said Tarosky. ”I’m real-
ly looking fon/vard to it because
we are just getting better and bet-

Tarosky said he always knew
he would go to Pitt. ”My two sis-
ters and my father all went to Pitt,
so it's sort of in my blood,” he
said. ,So far Tarosky has been
pleased with his decision. ”My

The Lady Panthers Gymnastics
Team placed second in a tri-meet
held at the University of Mary-
land last Saturday.

Maryland placed first with a
score of 178.7, Pitt followed with
177.05 and Towson State came
in third with 175.8.

Calderone standouts at tri-meet

Panthers lost the meet on. the
balance beam where they had to
count four falls, two points sub-
tracted from the overall team
score.

Top placer on the vault for the
Lady Panthers was senior Alisa
Spector. Spector took fourth-

. place with a 9.2. The first place

award went t0 Ronnanne COITI-

merford from Maryland, who’

scored a 9.55.
Pitt junior Beth Waters tied for

second place on the uneven bars
with Lori Salindong with -a score
of 9.3. Spector took third with a
9.1. First place went to
Maryland's Stephanie Young,
who scored 9.4.

Spector placed first on the
balance beam with a score of 9.1.
Spector and junior Kim Calder-
one were the only two Lady Pan-
thers who ”hit” beam, according
to Coach Yohman. Second place
on the balance beam went to
Robin Swick from Maryland, with

a 9.05. Third . place ‘went to
Stephanie Young and Vicki
Volentine, both from Maryland.

Sophomore Trish Aser, one of
Pitt's most consistent floor per-
formers, once again completed a
beautiful routine. Aser scored a
9.2, which gave her second
place. First place went to
Maryland's Swick with a 9.5, and
Lori Salindong and Karen Bian-
chino tied for third with a 9.15.

Coach ‘Yohman commented on

the performance of Calderone,
saying that if Calderone had com-

peted on bars, instead of exhibi- ‘

tioning, she would have had her
highest all—around of the season.

Calderone scored a 9.0 on vault, _

8.05 on exhibition bars, 8.9 on
the balance beam and 9.05 on
the floor exercise.

The final home‘. meet of the sea-

son for the Lady Panthers is

against Clarion University on Fri-
day night at Trees Hall at 7.

school,” he added.

Tarosky, who is from Apollo,
Pa., said that several people have
influenced him. ”[Pitt coach]
Frank D’Amico has taught me.ex-
cellent gymnastics technique. I'm

‘very thankful to Frank that he

gave me the opportunity to work
out with such talent,” said

Tarosky. ”Plus, my parents have .

supported me in any type of en-
deavor that I've tried. Plus, my fi-
ancee, Tammy, has given me a
lot of emotional support.” I

The easiest event, alsolthe

, favorite, for Tarosky is the rings.
”I like the rings because that's my 1

highest scoring event, and that's

the one I do best on,” he said. But
the pommel horse is a different
story. ”lt’s enjoyable to do, but it
requires a lot of balance, and you
can fall off easily.”

Tarosky doesn't have many
goals going into a meet. Said

Tarosky: ”There are so many

talented athletes at Pitt. You
could have been good at your
high school or even in your state,
but then when you get to a
university and you have a pool of
talent from everywhere, it's hard
to set expectations for yourself.

”I think my ability to continue
to show improvement and maybe
my consistency is one of the
things that has kept me going. I'm

‘ 

My two sisters and
my father all went to
Pitt, so it's sort of in my
blood.

— Dan Tarosky

always glad just to be healthy and
just to compete. If I go out there
and do the best that I can, then
I'm a very happy person.
Tarosky’s biggest thrills in gym-
nastics have been rather simple.

”Iust enduring this long. I've seen
so many gymnasts come and go
throughout the years,” he said.
”Also, taking a first place on rings
at the Great Lakes Champion-

ships was a great feeling because .

that was my first first-place ever.
It was just an incredible feeling
to be the No. 1 ring person for a

_day.”

Tarosky, who is majoring in
communications, would like to

continue gymnastics after col-
lege. ”In the future, I would like

to be active in gymnastics in

some capacity. I would like to
coach and work withkids.” W

Tarosky added, ”Gymnastics is
a wonderful sport although it is

-risky, and it teaches you to be a

very disciplined person. You
spend a lot of time just learning
one trick, and you can use that
type of attitude all around/,’

other Pitt pitchers. Merigliano
pitched 7 innings in the Prince-
ton game, giving up nine hits and
seven runs, six of them earned.
MerigIiano’s best stat, however,
is his strikeout-to-walk ratio. He

fanned 11 batters while walking

only six.
’’I had a lot of strikeouts,” he

' admitted, but actually I was kind

of wild.’ But it was the first time

out, so it doesn't really bother me _

that much.

said he had performed a
thorough physical on Parrish and
found the catcher in excellent
condition.

”He is a well intentioned, mild-
mannered young man who
listens. He knows what he has to
do [about his chronic back all-
ment] and does it.

’’I put him through all thetests
necessary for lower back and leg
problems and found him within
normal limits.”

Marone said he was more op-
timistic on Parrish’s back
problem after the examination
than he was just from reading
reports and talking with other
doctors about the case.

Felske also was pleased with a
four-inning performance by left-
hander Don Carman in a B game
Friday against the Toronto Blue
Jays.

”He pitched three strong in-
nings, then tired and gave up four
in the fourth,” Felske reported.

Carman had a 13.50 ERA in
two previous spring game
innings.

The manager said Carman
seemed to have no problem with
the thumb that was broken in an
automobile accident this winter.

Felske said he also was very
aware of Marone’s caution that

. Carman’s chronic shoulder

tenderness might create a stami-
na factor.

Marone’s latest report on pitch-
er Kevin Gross’ herniated disc
was that Gross might be bothered
by it all season butthat it should
not affect his pitching.
