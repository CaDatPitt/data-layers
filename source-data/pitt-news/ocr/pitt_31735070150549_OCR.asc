A/Pitt’s founder, Hugh Henry

Brackenridge, did not like to get
his clothes wet. So when it rained
while he was traveling, he would
remove his clothes, placing them
with his other luggage until the
weather calmed.

“Our founder was an eccen-
tric,” Jean Ferguson Carr, Pitt’s
director of women’s studies, said
on Friday to about 40 people in
the Frick Fine Arts auditorium.

Carr, along with professor of
law Bernard Hibbitts and assis-
tant professor of English Court-
ney Weikle-Mills had gathered
for a°panel discussion on Brack-
enridge’s 18th century novel,
“Modern Chivalry.” The event
was part of Pitt’s 225th anniver-
sary celebration.

The book follows the ﬁctional
misadventures of Captain John
Farrago and his servant Teague
O’Regan as they explore the poli-
tics of their day through life on
the frontier.

All Time Low rocks out at Fall Fest

Mahita Gaj anan
Staff Wrz'ter

After starting a mosh pit and
crowd surﬁng, sophomore Joe
Aravich found himself on stage
at the All Time Low concert. Lead
singer Jack Barakat called him up
from the crowd, and Aravich got
the opportunity to meet each band
member before exiting the stage.

“It was an absolute dream come
true,” said Aravich, a long—time All
Time Low fan. “They’re the reason
why I play music.”

The concert was part of Pitt
Program Council’s annual Fall
Fest at Schenley Plaza on Sunday.

The event included craft booths,

small competitions, kettle corn
and apple cider and a performance
by pop-punk band All Time Low.
About 1,500 people attended the
event. .

Because of a ﬂight cancella-
tion, the band’s performance.was
pushed back from its original ear-
ly—afternoon start time to 4 p.m.,
and the headliners actually started
at about 5 p.m. To accommodate
the band, PPC pushed back the
two opening musical acts and ex-

tended the time students could

participate in the activities booths.
“I wanted to getlrny fall grub
on,” sophomore Melanie Ester-
man said, emphasizing her antici-
pation of. eating the fall-themed
foods. Despite the rainy weather,
Esterman and her friends partici-
pated in all of the day’s activities.
Although normally held on Big-
elow Boulevard, Fall Fest moved to
Schenley» Plaza this year because
PPC did not get permission to
block the road. '
“The people at Pitt Parks Con-
servancy were kind enough to
cooperate,” student life assistant
director Tom Misuraca said about
moving the event to the Conser-
vancy—maintained land.

Low, licks the six-string at Schenley Plaza for the annual Fall Fest,

The new location made setup
challenging because the ground
at Schenley Plaza "is uneven, .and
there is "no ' easy way to move
equipment around. '

“We had students building for
12 hours,” said Zoe Mulcahy, PPC’s
public relations director.

Despite the diﬂicultyl of setting
up the event at the new location,
PPC managed to make sure the
show went on.

“This was a great accomplish-
ment for the students of Pitt Pro-
gram Council,” Misuraca said.
“They overcame all the obstacles

and hardships and made it happen
' for the students.”

PPC began planning the event

last April.

“It takes a long time for con-
tracts to go back and forth,”
Mulcahy said. . i

To pick the bands that 'would
perform in the opening act, PPC
held an online battle of the bands
in which musical groups could
submit performance videos. The

Em Maier
Stcyj‘ Writer

The "Pittsburgh Commission on
Human Relations denied Pitt’s

-motion to dismiss a complaint

on Sept. 25 that the LGBTQ stu-
dent advocacy group Rainbow
Alliance filed against the Uni-
versity.

Rainbow Alliance submitted
a revised complaint regarding
Pitt’s transgender policy on
July 27, two months after the
organization’s initial allega-
tions were disputed by the Uni-
versity. This is the second mo-
tion the University hasmade to
dismiss the complaint.

"‘It- really legitimizes the
process. It’s beingtaken seri-
ously now. They have to look
at it now. It’s very encourag-
ing that all the work we’ve put
in is going somewhere,” said
Darren Pifer, vice president of
Rainbow Alliance.

Adelaide Smith, chair emer-
itus of the Human Relations
Commission, wrote that the
amended complaint is “suffi-
cient for the Complainant  to
initiate the above-cited matter
before the Commission.”

The order stated that the
complaint speciﬁcally identi-
fied the complainant and re-
spondent and contended that
unlawful discriminatory poli-
cies are occurring within city
limits.-It also stated that the
complainant “as a result of the

be the two best bands to perform before All
Time Low. The winners for Fall Fest were
The Midnight Special and White Like Fire.

The late start and shaky weather did
not deter enthusiastic fans from crowding
around the stage.

Duquesne junior Cody Bartges, sporting
an All Time Low shirt, waited in Schenley

Plaza for the band to arrive. It was Bart-
ges’ second time seeing All Time Low, and
he didn’t mind the wait. To pass the time,
he walked around and visited the different
booths at Fall Fest.

“I really like that they doathis and then
provide a free concert,” Bartges said.

By the late afternoon, the sky cleared, and
the sun shone over Schenley Plaza. Students
who had left Fall Fest earlier came back for
the concert and cheered as the band walked

out onto the stage. After quickly apologizing -

for the late arrival, All Time Low began its
performance.

“We love them,” freshman Amy Zeglen
said, speaking for her group of friends.
“They always put on a good show.”

Barakat and the other band members
interacted with the crowd and spoke a lot
between songs. They mixed up old hits with
new songs, even singing a few tunes from
their upcoming album, Don’t Panic.

“It was awesome,” freshman Nate Kend-
sersky said. “It was good that not many peo-

  

ple were there, so there was more of a con-
nection with the band.”

After the concert, the band stuck around
to sign autographs and take pictures. Kend-
sersky held up his wallet, showing off the
autograph from the band’s drummer, Rian
Dawson.

Samantha Bycura, special events director
for PPC, thought the event was successful.

“They have really devoted fans, so

the crowd was awesome,” Bycura said. “I

thought it went really well.’’ [

acts has, and continues, to suffer dam-
ages for which it contends it should be
compensated.”

Rainbow Alliance President Tricia
Dougherty originally ﬁled a complaint
with the Pittsburgh Commission on Hu-
man Relations on April 25, alleging dis-
crimination based on the University’s
gendered facilities policy.

“This is a stepping point, a turn in
our favor. I’m glad we’re moving for-
ward and able to help people,” said

V Dougherty.

FOUNDER

versity of Pittsburgh — Brackenridge was a
notable writer, state legislator, educator and
Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice. He was
also the founder of The Pittsburgh Gazette
— now the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — and
a lawyer. But he never went to law school;
instead, he studied through an apprentice-
ship.

“His standing as a lawyer explained his
other pursuits. Law, for Brackenridge, was
reason,” Hibbitts said during his talk about
the role of law in “Modern Chivalry.”

Brackenridge was not only a well-edu-
cated man with varied interests, but he also
had quite a sense of humor, according to
Weikle-Mills, who shared an anecdote about

The organization objected to the
University announcing a policy last
spring stating that all transgender stu-
dents must use gendered facilities ac-
cording to the sex listed on their birth
certiﬁcates. The new policy required
that students who wished to use fa-
cilities designated for the opposite sex
first undergo sex—reassignment sur-
gery, a costly and invasive procedure.
Previously, the University had no stat-
ed policy governing the use ofgendered
facilities, allowing for more flexibility
in practice.

Dougherty and Pifer have also cre-
ated an ad hoc committee, focusing on
the transgender issue in order to come

up with numerous ways — such as let-
ter—writing and petitions — that the
club can help aside from the litigation.
Its first meeting is expected to be next
week.

“This is an issue I’m really passion-
ate about, and a lot of people have been
offering to help by forming the commit-
tee in order to talk and brainstorm new
ideas,” Dougherty said.

Patrick Noonan, associate general

counsel at Pitt, refused to comment re-

garding the pending litigation.

Pitt can be ﬁned a maximum of $300
if the Pittsburgh Commission on Hu-
man Relations rules in favor of Rainbow
Alliance. I '

a dinner Brackenridge once had with George . 3:1 :    ' . /

Washington. Washingtonwould not laugh C

at Brackenridge’s stories, so Brackenridge
told them repeatedly with increasing gusto
throughout the night.

After the dinner, or so the story goes,
Brackenridge could hear Washington re-
leasing his pent—up laughter in the bedroom
next door.

“Such was the prudence of Washington
and the humor of Brackenridge,” Weikle-
Mills said.

The discussion was accompanied by a
display from Pitt’s Darlington Collection,
featuring books, maps and articles pub-
lished in Pittsburgh during Brackenridge’s
time. Guests perused the collection before
and after the discussion just_outside the au-
ditorium in the cloister.

Hibbitts ended his"talk with a quote from
“Modern Chivalry”. a

‘‘Do justice, love mercy, Walk humbly,”
he said. “Hugh Henry Brackenridge died'al-
most 200 years ago, but there is still time for
us to become Br'ackenridge’s heirs.” I

THE STAMATTCK

  
   

Nick Stamatakis
Assistanzf Opimbns Editor

In the past few years, higher edu- .

cation has begun a slow tip toward
incorporating more electronic
delivery methods. The traditional
model of a teacher leading a room
full of students now shows signs of
fracturing. _

The Khan Academy, started in
2006, has offered millions of free,
online—video lessons for high school
and middle school students and is
now partnering with schools to cre-
ate interactive curricula.

Google Fellow Sebastian Thrun’s

education startup, Udacity, prom— _

ises to reach thousands of college-
aged students with Stanford-quality
lessons in science and technology.

Inspired by his experimentation .

with online education — a comput-
er-based artiﬁcial intelligence class
joined by 160,000 students —— Th-
run now offers 11 science, technol-
ogy, engineering and mathematics,
or “STEM,” courses.for free.
Joined with Udacity are dozens
of other education startups, rang-
ing from small boutique projects

such as George Mason economists"

Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok’s
Marginal Revolution University to
larger projects such as the online
educator site Coursera, which part-
ners with professors —— including
some at Pitt — to offer hundreds
of higher—level courses.

These developments are making
education cheaper. One professor
can teach thousands with only an
Internet connection and a $200
laptop. Whatever the cost of one
class, 18 credits’ worth of education

00 S

Humanities, sciences  soon do battle

With changes in teaching methods, the fate of a liberal arts education hangs in baiance. MCT Campus

at this model costs nowhere near
our current $15,000 tuition.

Not only is it cheap, but it’s a
much better way to learn. Home-
work in physics or calculus today
means a bunch of scribbles, graded
by a person not ﬂuent in English
and returned weeks later with
other, less—meaningful scribbles.
Students sit perplexed in unintel-
ligible lectures, afraid to raise their
hands as they spiral in increasing
circles of conﬁision. Online edu-
cation, arguably, solves all these
problems.

But there is a huge elephant in
the room. As the STEM students go

forward, enjoying the beneﬁts of »

cheap and effective education, 84
percent of American graduates —
the proportion not at all involved in
science or math — have a legitimate
concern: What about the humani-
ties and socialsciences?

These disciplines don’t scale up
to the'1000—1 student-to-teacher

ratios; teacherinteraction is much.

more important, and learning fol-
lows more Socratic models. Stu-

. dents engage in discussion to reach-

insights in a less linear manner than

"those in the STEM ﬁelds; the value

of the education comes as much

' from this method as from its con-

tent.

So the situation might be that
as the cost of a science and math
education plummets, the cost of a
traditional humanities or social sci-
ence education will stay the same.
The future science model — one
super teacher efﬁciently covering
thousands of students —- will stay
cheap, wheras thousands of English
professors will still need to expen-

sively teach 101 classes at colleges
across the country. The slight cost
advantage the humanities enjoy
today —- no labs or massive com-
puters to fund — will completely
vanish and then some.

We will then be faced with two
options: We can either subsidize
the cost of a humanities education,
preventing large tuition increases
by not allowing science tuitions to
drop, or we can allow the cost of a
humanities education to rise.

I’m not sure what the best an-
swer is. Subsidizing humanities
would cost billions, and it would go
against most principles of modern
economics. As the cost of produc-
tion goes up, rising prices help en-
sure we don’t produce too much of a
resource-draining product. Higher
tuition would help prevent wasted
resources.

But there are obvious negatives
too. You don’t want rich kids to be
theonly ones with philosophy de-
grees. The dual tuition scenario
would also only encourage the
increasing marginalization of the
humanities, contributing to exist-
ing feelings that regard science as
the elite ﬁeld.

Regardless, these questions will
need to be addressed in the next 15
years. Our children will not learn
astronomy the samewway as they
learn Aristotle, and because these
differences will have signiﬁcant
cost differences, age-old ques-
tions about the value of a liberal
arts education will move from the
realm‘ of academic theorizing to ap-
plied policy.

MEN’S SOCCER

Andrew Stern
Staﬁ Wrz'ter

Niéisspite a promising start to the
season, the Pitt men’s soccer
team has struggled to cope with
life in the challenging Big East.

After dropping a 3-1 contest
to No. 5 Georgetown (10-0-1,
2-0 Big East) on Saturday night
at the Petersen Sports Com-
plex, the Panthers (6-3-2, 0-2
Big East) have now lost three
games in a row — all at home.

But Pitt’s performance
against the Hoyas —— one of the

"tﬁst college teams in the nation
—— showed that the Panthers
have the ability to compete
against the conference’s elite.

After allowing an early goal,
Pitt was able to hold off a late
ﬁrst-half surge from the Hoyas,
heading into the locker room
down byjust one.

And at the beginning of the
second half, the Panthers dom-
inated a 10-minute stretch dur-
ing which Pitt almost scored an

"ﬁjualizing goal multiple times.

But, as great teams do,
Georgetown held on and capi-
talizedwhen given an opportu-
nity to double its advantage.

After Pitt failed to clear a
bouncing ball, Hoya forward

“Panthers struggle, lose third straight against No.5 Georgetown

Steve Neumann gathered it
and rocketed a shot on net that
Pitt goalie Lee Johnston saved.
The ball then headed right, to
Georgetown’s Brandon Allen,
who buried the chance for his
eighth -goal of the season and
second of the match.

As they have done multiple
times this year, the Panthers
battled back.

Off Pitt’s first corner kick of
the match, redshirt freshman
Ryan Myers sent a nice cross-
into the box that found junior
defender John Cordier, Pitt’s
co-captain, who directed the
ball into the back of the net. '

Down just 2-1 against the
ﬁfth-best team in the coun-
try, Pitt seemed energized and
confident that it could level the
game.

But that feeling was short-
lived.

Less than 10 minutes after
Pitt’s goal, Georgetown secured
the victory when Neumann
fired a ball into the roof of]ohn-
ston’s net. Neumann finished
the game with three points: one
goal and two assists. '

After the game, Cordier ex-
plained that he was pleased

Field Stadium or the blue ones
_of the Petersen Events Center,
Pitt fans usually unite to cheer
for their beloved Panthers.

But this week induces one of A

the greatest schisms among the
gtﬂdent body, a divisive event
that comes around only once
every four years: Steelers vs.

Eagles.

Other Pittsburgh-Phila-
delphia rivalries like Pirates-
Phillies and Penguins—Flyers
create considerable animosity
between students from the op-
posing cities —- especially the
latter — but neither are quite
as hostile as their NFL counter-
part.

Maybe it’s because the com-
petitive gap between the two
teams involved isn’t nearly as
wide as it is in the baseball in-
stallment of the rivalry. Maybe
it’s because football is more
appealing to the general public
than hockey and thus, results in
more trash talk and anticipa-

\

tion from the casual fan.

Or perhaps it’s a combina-
tion of both: that the Steelers
—_ who have won two cham-
pionships in the past decade
— and the Eagles —— who have
come so close so often in the
same time period— are two
premier teams in one of Amer-
ica’s premier professional
sports leagues, yet they rarely
play each other in the regular
season.

And while the local AFC
dwellers have been more suc-
cessful overall, the head-to-
head series between the two
clubs has actually ended in
favor of The City of Brotherly

Love more often than not.

That’s right, the Eagles have
beaten the Steelers in six of
their most recent eight meet-
ings — ‘including a 15-6 victory
in the most recent 2008 clash
-— and hold a 47-27-3 all-time
advantage.

But when faced with that
fact, Pittsburgh fans can sim-
ply point to their 'team’s six Su-
per Bowl trophies, of which the
birds from Philadelphia have
none.

And more than just the egos
of the students from both sides
will be at stake when the two
teams meet Sunday.

Coming off their bye week,

the Steelers are hoping to avoid
an embarrassing 1-3 start to
their 2012 campaign. Mean-
while, quarterback Michael
Vick and his Eagles teammates
need a win to keep pace with
Dallas and New York in the NFC

, East.

Pitt students from the East
boast former Panther running
backs LeSean McCoy and Dion
Lewis on theiriteam of choice,
while those from the West can
claim, well, the location of the
University.

year’s gridiron edition of The

Incline vs. The Liberty Bell is its location
in Pittsburgh at Heinz Field, meaning all
those pesky Pitt-student Eagles fans can
inﬁltrate the Steelers fortress of football
if they so please. ‘

So as Steelers-Eagles —— or Steagles,
as they were known when the two cross-
state rival teams temporarily merged for
the 1943 season because of World War II
-—— Week kicks off, and tensions continue
to mount until Sunday, embrace the pig-
skin clash of Center City vs. “Dahntahn"/”
and Pat’s vs. Primanti’s.

It’s not like either team is public en-
emy No. 1 for the other anyway.

Asslumingthe two don’t meet again
in the Super Bowl, as many hoped they
would in 2008 — the Steelers held up
their end of the deal, but .the Eagles fell
to.Arizona in the NFC Championship -

  

    

the outcome of Sunday’s matchup will
determine which side of Penn’s Woods
boasts the bragging rights for the next
four years.

It’s a fantastic rivalry, especially
since it can be enjoyed in moderation.
After Sunday, both fan bases will have to
resort to comparing the two teams based
on how they fare elsewhere in the NFL.

But while you should feel inclined
to bask in the bad blood between your-
self and your fellow Pitt students from
the other side of this state, don’t lose

. sight of what’s really important: Jeer the

Mountaineers, curse the Nittany Lions
and laugh at Pitt’s Big East foes.

And hey, there is one other thing
Pittsburghers and Philadelphians alike

can always agree on: Nothing’s worse-

than those . south-central Pennsylva-
nians who side with the Baltimore Ra-
vens. I

MEN’S SOCCER

with Pitt’s second—half performance.

“After halftime, we realized that even
though they are the No. 5 team in the
country, we can play with them,” he said.
“I’m proud of the way the guys surged in
the second half and didn’t quit.”

Even though the team’s only goal
came offa set piece, Pitt sophomore for-
ward Chu Chu Onyeukwu believes that
the Panthers’ offensive patience will
eventually pay off.

“When I got out there tonight, I saw

. that if I slow down, I can always do some-

thing better with the ball. Unfortunately,
it didn’t translate to a goal tonight, but
I will keep improving,” Onyeukwu said.

Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher ap— I

plauded his team’s effort, but he admit-
ted that the Panthers need to play smart-

" er Wednesday in their next game at No. 8

Notre Dame.

“I told the guys after the game tonight _

that before Wednesday’s game we’re not
going to be getting any more skilled or
fitter,” he ‘said. “So if we want to walk
away with a good result, we need to get
smarter and play smarter soccer.”

Carrying a three-game losing streak,
the Panthers will head on the road to
face the Fighting Irish before traveling
to Seton Hall Saturday for another con-
ference matchup. H
