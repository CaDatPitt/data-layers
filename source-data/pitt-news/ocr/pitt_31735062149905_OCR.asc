Take Annual
Customs Tests

Freshman women are being called
to the colors today and tomorrow,
as they seek to exchange-their green
armbands for the gold and blue
ones by successfully passing the tra-
ditional customs examination.

The compulsory examinations,
which consist of questions covering
most phases of campus activity, will
be conducted hourly from, 8:30
o’clock in 1228 Cathedral. Fresh-
man women must present covenant
cards at the time of their examina-
tion, announces Nancy Crawford,
C42, customs chairman. Miss Craw-
ford adds that they should report
as early as possible to avoid a last-
minute rush.

For the written examination,
given each year by the customs
committee of WSGA, freshman
women must know the history of
the University, songs and cheers,
names «of -adminisrative ofﬁcers, stu-
dent activity leaders, and the “rea-

sons” for customs, as stated in the

Vade Mecum. Those who pass the
examination will receive gold and
blue armbands Monday in 1209 Ca-

_ thedral.

8:30 o’clock in the Commons Room.

Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, ad-
viser to the nationality rooms, an-
nounces that Peter Pivaronis will
act as chairman of the room com-

mittee; and that William Zamblaus-
kas, ’36, will serve as presiding of-
ﬁcer.

Emphasizing weaving, the out-
standing handicraft work in Lithu-
anian homes for centuries, the Lith-
uanian room is unique for its“ use
of linen as a wall covering. The
wall linen, woven by Lithuanian
women and following a design
known as “The Bath of the Birds,”
is based upon an original in a
Lithuanian museum.

All students are welcome and no
tickets for the event are required.

South American Student Tells

0!’ Educational Set-up at Home  

By Georgia Shuset and Edith Rosenblatt

At last!

A college student has been found
who knows he’s going to get a job
when he graduates. “They have to
hire me,” explained Edgardo Pati-
110, senior in the University School
of; Mines, “because there, are so few
petroleum engineers in Colombia.”

Twenty-one-old Edgardo, a na-
tive of Cali, Colombia, the South
American country just east of Pan-

-ama, went to the University of Okla-

homa for two years. Then he came
to Pitt because of its location in the
industrial center of the country, and
because he feels that Pitt is out-
standing in the ﬁeld of petroleum
engine-cring.

He mentioned some of the differ-
ences in educational customs be-
tween South America and the
United States. Very few Women
attend the universities in Colombia.
They do not have much interest ‘in
higher education, their prime am“
in life being to marry. ‘ ’

and high

In the elementary
schools the boys and girls are seg-
regated. V

Arguing with the professor is out
—-in Colombian schools. The stu-
dent must accept the instructor’s
word as ﬁnal. “I. used to get ‘In
Dutch’ because I insisted on ques-
tioning the teacher’s word,” Edgar-
do remarked. Students do not se-
lect their own subjects. Their
courses of study are planned by
university officials.

There are no liberal arts col-
leges; a scholar must select a pro-
fession. The government main-
tains an agreement with the church,
and all educational programs in“
clude religious training.

Education in Colombia leans to-
ward the classical rather than the
scientiﬁc, Edgardo believes. French

is taught for its cultural value, and
English’ for its business value, Co-
lombia being a coffee-growing and
trading center with the United
States.

A. one-year military training
courseis required for young” men in
Colombia. The tall, quiet-man-
nered young engineer considers the
military profession “rather dull,”
although he would not exactly mind
being a general. .

Edgardo, one of four children,
would like to work in the petroleum
ﬁelds of the United States for at
least a year before returning to his
native country.

In reply toqgueries concerning his
outside interests, he stated that he
enjoys Hollywood-made motion pic-
tures. Movies are not made in Co-
lombia; they come from the United
States, Europe, A1"gen’Cina, ﬁnd
Mexico. Colombians prefer French
pictures because of their realism.
“We like a bit of tragedy once in a
while. You know where the hero-
ine dies in the end,” he explained.

He believes that much of the
ﬂavor of Spanish music is lost in
North American interpretation, but
Spanish musicians probably don’t
catch the rhythm of “swing” music
either, he commented. '

Falling back on the stock q_ues-
tions of interviewers, we asked what
Edgardo thought of Pitt women.
Reverting to the usual reply, he said
they were pretty and charming. He

also added that he appreciates the
friendliness of Pitt students.

Apropos to the present relations
between North and South America,
he said that the Colombians approve
of the attitude of equality which the
United States displays, rather than
the “big-stick” policy of former
years.

Book 
To Remain Open

'iFor those students who haven’t

bought all their books as yet and
who haven’t had a chance to visit
the Men’s council book exchange in
833‘ Cathedral, the exchange will re-
main open a few days longer.

Any student who has books in the ‘

exchange that are still unsold either

‘ca,n_.ipresent,his receipt and get.his

books back, or can leave the books
with the exchange to be sold at the
beginning of next semester.

The ‘remaining used books also
are sold at the standard price of
two-thirds of new book cost. The
exchange is adding its 15 per cent
deductions- on all sales to the Men’s
Student Loan fund maintained by
Men’s council. '

Alumni Group,
Trustees Meet

For Settlement

Bodies Will Decide
Method of Election

, A joint committee representing
the General Alumni association and
the Board of Trustees will meet
Friday to settle the trustee election
system.  ‘

Thirteen ofithe 30 trusteeships of
the Board are vacant, and the alum-
n‘i~-ha'»ve~~ nominated '13 men, -eight ~ of
Whom are present members. An
election was supposed to have been
lreld last spring but was side-step-
Pjed becausepf disagreement be-
tween the two groups over the meth-
0d of election. This fall, however,
the groups expect to agree. The
meeting on Friday probably will
pave the way for the election. '

. In a public statement last week,
attorney Harbaugh Miller, presi-
dent of the alumni association, said:
“This matter has been in too con-
troversial a light. There is no
reason to believe that the trustees
will not seat the nominees of the
Alumni.”
-3 Mr. Miller further explained that

ght of the nominees are already
 the board and the others are
prominent men and therefore the
slate should be acceptable to the
Board. ~

Under the present election sys-
.tem, adopted in 1937 at the insist-
ence of former Governor Earle, the
.Alumni can nominate candidates
for half of the board’s 30 trustee-

‘Class in Wider Use in All Fields    
Due to New Types,’ Says Silverman  

Wider use of glass in construc-
tion, including walls, has resulted
from improvement of the product
and variety of its types, and the
United States now manufactures
enough window and plate glass
alone daily to pave a 10-lane boule-
vard around the world, says Dr.
Alexander Silverman, professor and
head of the department of chem-
istry.

The art of glass making goes back
to ancient times and even antedates
archaeological record, but the ‘sci-
ence of glass—making is compara-
tively new, Dr. Silverman explains.
Most of the important developments
in this ﬁeld have taken place within
the last half century, he adds.

Dr. Silverman recalls dozens of
glass items which have been known
for centuries, but whose applica-
tions to modern industrial needs
only recently been discovered.

“For example,” he points out,
“fiber glass was used at one time

DR. ALEXANDER SILVERMAN
glass is not dismissed

for ornamental purposes, such as
aigrettes for women and glass curls
for the barrister, but its dynamic
uses for thermal and electrical in-
sulation is a twentieth century
adaptation. Marbles have been toys
as far back as memory goes, but the
idea of melting them to insure uni-
formity in ﬁber glass is new.

“In the nineteenth century a 100-
inch lens on a telescope was con-
sidered a great accomplishment, and
a 1000—watt bulb had to be enor-
moms in size. Now the 200-inch
lens at the Mount Falomar obser-
vatory is taken for granted, and a
1000-watt bulb is the size of a
cigarette.

“We live in gl.ass houses and are
not afraid to throw stones. Reflec-
tion from beads, once worn only
around the neck, now warns motor-
ists on the highways. The modern

Five Hundred Years
Of Printers’ Ink

THIS WEEK THE newspaper world celebrates the ﬁve-
hundredth anniversary of the printing press.

There is more to the occasion than the honoring of a mechan-
ical device for the re-creation on paper of a printed symbol. What
we are celebrating, rather, is the idea of the thing, the concept
of the printing press as a spotlight penetrating through the fog
of ﬁfteenth century ignorance.

Democracy, it has been said, is the right of the people to make
their own mistakes.

True, democracy cannot exist unless the people have access
to all the facts.

Conversely, there can be no tyranny, no despotism, there can
be no totalitarian state when the people have access to all the
facts.

It is a tribute to the modern newspaper that one of the ﬁrst
moves of Europe’s dictators, upon coming into power, was the
suppression and later the control of the press as a means of pro-
paganda. Is it not evident, then, that the same weapon which is
so effective inits work for the forces of evil may be just as val-
uable in the services of Truth and Democracy? Could not the
same weapon strike as strongly for good as it does for corrup-
tion?

We have too long visualiaed -virtueas a static thing, as«-a state
of existence. Vice, we have felt, is an ever-moving object against
which virtue must always be on the defensive. This is why
Schickelgruber refers to the democracies and the democratic
system of government as stagnant.

Our newspapers have, for years, been pointing out to us that
goodness is more than an attitude, more than a contented sitting-
back with a smile on one’s face and a halo above one’s head.
Goodness is a dynamic thing. It is a way of living, a medium for
thinking, a pattern for action. That action may be in the form
of thought—communication via the public press.

With the printing press --came many things: the development
of a digniﬁed, literary vernacular, the concept of education for
all, the expansion of the ﬁeld of thought.

With the modern newspaper, the man in the street has be-
‘come a versatilist. He is a statesman and an artist, a poet and a
peddler. He "knows what Stalin thinks in regard to Alaska, and
what the chief of police in Oshkosh thinks in regard to park-
petters.

‘ =1< >l< =l= * >l<

This week we are celebrating another anniversary.

It was two-hundred ﬁfty years ago that Benjamin Harris’
Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick was ordered
off the streets of Boston by Governor Simon Bradstreet. The
charge was that of publishing war atrocities.

Both of these events "are signiﬁcant: the ﬁrst because it
"supplied the raw means; the second because it showed that the
.means alone is not sufficient, that the important thing is the di-
rection in which one steers the vehicle.

- V * * =14 ='s =14

As ﬂedgling journalists, we feel that we have a small part of
this responsibility for steering the vehicle. The Pitt News has,
as far as possible, attempted to follow the policy of good journal-
ism. We have used our news sections to present objective facts
as far as we knew them. We have furthermore, reserved the
right to use our editorial columns as a medium through which
to express our own biased opinions.

We believe that it is futile to attempt to write an unbiased
article. There is no such thing as an emotionally detached hu-
man being. ‘ — ' '

The-way to conduct an impartial newspaper, we believe, is
:not by silly pretense at having each of our writers report his
‘opinions in an objective manner. Impartialitycan be achieved
only by allowing each side to present its own prejudiced view-
point. Prejudice can be a great thing, and lack of it can signify
nothing but absence of opinion.

We have always held to the two-sided bias as a means to fair-
ness. These pages have always been open to the reader, and
sincerity has been valued above literary technique.

As long as the Pitt News is a student newspaper, .its pages

_‘ will be open for discussions of on and off campus happenings by
editorial writers, columnists, and those non-stafﬂmembers of the
student -body who have something to say. i

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the
only president in the history of the
United States who has fought for
the underprivileged, has made it
clear that he expects the.American
voter to choose between what his
administration has accomplished and

what the Republican candidate
promises. So let’s look at the rec-
ord.

Mr. Roosevelt’s- objectives were
and are the real objectives of any
genuine democrat. But Mr. Roose-
velt has made ‘mistakes, and his
own stubbornness has defeated
many New Deal purposes.

More often than not he has em-
ployed devious and crude methods
and unqualiﬁed or characterless as-
sociates. He has had ‘$0.0 man;

might have once had in her. Mr.
Roosevelt is not blind to this situ-
ation, and he should have taken
some decisive action long ago.

Secretary of the Treasury Henry
Morganthau never should have been
appointed to the Cabinet. First of
all, he knew little about ﬁnance;
he was and is a scientiﬁc farmer.
Second, he had never shown any
disposition for directing an oiﬁce so
important to the country’s welfare;
he is a quiet intellectual. Honest
and scholarly, Mr. 1\/Iorganthau has
chosen his assistants wisely, and
they are responsible for his depart-
ment’s good health to date.

One example of an impulsive, im-
prudent associate is Mr. Rooseve1t’s
Secretary of the Interior--I-Iarold
Ickes. Bombastic, vitriolic, and un-
predictable, although an incorrupt-
ible servant, Mr. Ickes is a liabil-
ity. He is the liberal counterpart
of the always disgruntled militarist
Hugh Johnson.

Labor Takes A Ride

The CIO and AFL are still walk-
ing on opposite sides of the road.
John Lewis, despite his two bril-
liant, conscientious vice presidents
—-Phillip Murray and Sidney Hill-
man——refuses to even meet with
AFL officials. William Green, of
the AFL, has been particularly re-
calcitrant.

The unemployment question is
not yet answered. Certain govern-
,ment agencies, as I mentioned be-
fore, have absorbed unemployed,
but they simply can’t solve the em-
ployment problem for the ten mil-
_lion still inactive.’ Furthermore,
these organizations are not perma-
nent.

Mr. Rosevelt’s close political
alignment with Paul “Hoosier Hit-
ler” lVlcNutt, Mayor Frank Hague,
Kelly, Nash, et al, cannot be ex-
cused.

Our diplomatic corps, with all
due respect to‘ Secretary I-lull, Sum-
ner Welles and Adolf Berle, has a
distinctly foul odor.

The President appointed the un-
holy William Knudsen chairman of
the Defense commission. Why un-
holy‘? Because Mr. Knudsen took
part in the Nazi ceremonies when
Henry Ford was decorated by the
Third» Reich; because Mr. Knudsen
tolerates as assistant vice president
ofshis General Motors one Arthur
l‘.fooney, an out-and-out anti—Amer-
ican; because Mr. Knudsen allows
G1‘./I’s labor disputes to go on and

That’s the record, in brief.

I
By Gerald Ziskind, C41

For eight years I have cham-
pioned the cause of Franklin D.
Roosevelt. I spoke at hundreds of
rallies in his behalf, not only be-
cause I accepted his principles of
liberal reform, but more signiﬁ-
cantly, because I recognized in him
a tremendous historical ﬁgure tak-
ing ﬁrst rank among all the world’s
leaders. '

I am glad to relate that once
again Irenew my campaign for him.
This time I join in a crusade. For
who dare defeat our President now?
Who dare challenge“ the only man
on the American scene tough enough
to hold the ramparts? He is the
giant, come to preserve the last
stronghold of free men. He has
risen. above pa.r.ty,. above faction.
No longer is he a mere Democrat.
He has become the symbol of a
spiritual force rallying men together
that they might gain strength to
ﬁght back against a degenerate
Nazism.

Any man who opposes Franklin
Roosevelt for partisan reasons is
grossly unpatriotic. There is no
partisan issue in this campaign.
The one. single issue is the preser-
vation of American democracy.

‘Hate FDR Campaign’

You may oppose some of the New
Deal. You may violently disagree
with liberal philosophy or social
legislation. You may be a special
privileged personage d e t e s t in g
Roosevelt’s aggressive action to help
the underdog. Or you may be one
who took great glee in the hate
Roosevelt campaign and helped cir-
culate ugly attacks upon his char-
acter and joined the vicious whis-
perers who dared not speak audibly.
But you are now an American’. If
you are a true American you will
forget your petty prejudices, your
harbored animosities, your inher-
ited opinions. You will forget past
differences. You will join with a
leadership proved and tried, uncom-
promising in its stand against the
butchers abroad and the traitors’ at
home.

If you are a true American you
will ﬁght for Roosevelt because of
the enemies he has made. Coughlin,
the Ku Klux Klan, the American
Nazi Bund, the Communist party——-
they are clawing at him. They are
out to get him, to soften America for
their day of triumph.

Willkie Is A Gamble

I am broadminded enough to rec-
ognize the presence of another can-
didate in this campaign entitled to
consideration of his merit. Were
these normal times I should be
willing to let the American people
gamble on his acceptability. But to
permit a Willkie victory now would
be to gamble the destiny of 130,-
000,000 Americans in a crap game
with the dice loaded against you.
This amateur, who never saw an
ambassador, who rose out of the
impulse of a magazine publisher——
‘where is his proven leadership, his
statesmanship, his mastery of crises?

I know that in this time of peril
you will rally together. You will
act together. And in one resound-
ing tone, whose mighty volume shall
give pause to the mad men of Eu-
rope, you shall declare: We have
chosen as our President the enemy
of intolerance, of hate, of World
dictatorship. As the symbol of free
men,~he shall. give radiant light and
world of darkness and
despair. What ﬁend who strikes at
our fret-rdom shall ﬁnd us marching
vxith Franklin D. Roosevelt, and
under his direction, we shall give
battle for the preservation of the
human soul.

from the

Sidelines

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

 

There’s only one thing to be said about Saturda_v’s game. Things
just can't be as bad as they seemed at Columbus. In fact, all
snap judgments to the contrary, the 1940 Pitt football team is go-
ing to beat some pretty good ball clubs before the season is over.
We’ll go farther. They’re going to start by beating Missouri.

All in all, the Ohio State defeat was a good thing for the
Panthers. ’l‘he_v came out of the game knowing what points in
their offense and defense they must strengtlien, and they were far
from disheartened. Rather than standing in awe of the Buckeyes’
power, they were inclined to blame their own mistakes for the
decisiveness of the defeat. ‘

No one is trying to present an alibi. Ohio State was the su-
perior team last Saturday and the chances are that the Bucks will
emerge as one of the country ’s finest elcvens. But the conjecture
remains that had the Pitt pass defense been even close to efficient,
State might have spent a very trying afternoon. *

Pitt Outlook Bright Despite Defeat

The .Panthe__rs’ future can’t look aiiything but brighter. No
other opponent will throw a more diversiﬁed attack at the Bowser
boys than did State, and the Pitt ends can’t'possib1y be made to
look sillier than they did on some Buckeye reverses. Part of the
fault lay with the Pittsburgh wingmen, but a great deal of credit
must go to the Scarlet backs. For an opening game, their bal_l_
handling approached perf<-ct'Ion.

State’s reserve strength cannot be minimized. Every time a
Buckeye sub came in, he was just as big and nearly as good as the
man he replaced. Francis Schmidt’s ball clubs have been known
for their bul.k, a11d the 1940 outﬁt outweighed the Panthers at
almost every position. Against the State behemoths, Charley Bow-
ser was forced to play Jack Benz, Ted Konetsky, Rudy Gradisek,
and Joe Rettinger for a full 58 minutes.

Admittedly, the Panthers looked weak in several spots but to
balance the weaknesses were the ﬁne showings of Konetsky, Kra-
cum, and Fife. Fife, hurt shortly after the second half started,
gave way to sophomore Vince Antonelli who showed considerable
promise during his stay on the ﬁeld.

Jack Stetler, third Panther left halfback, also turned in a neat
performance, his leaping catch of Thurbon’s pass late in the game
providing one of the outstanding plays of the game. Neither
Eddie Jones nor Frank Saksa, Stetler’s predecessors, were able to
get going, the State secondary breaking up or intercepting the
boys’ rather inaccurate aerials and the Buckeye tackles and ends

smearing their running efforts.

T hurbon, Bonelli Perform Creditably
Both Bob Thurbon and Ernie Bonelli did creditable service at

right‘ half.

Thurbon dove through a six inch hole for the only

Panther score, and Bonelli almost got away for a touchdown on a

scintillating kickoff runback.

One of the Panthers’ most noticeable defects was their shoddy

blocking and tackling.

Only on rare occasions were Pitt ball car-

riers shaken loose for sizeable gains, while Buckeye backs several

times broke away after being apparently stopped. Three men had
a shot at Anderson, State end, after‘he pulled i11 ScIotf’s pass but the
ﬂashy winger escaped all three and crossed the goal line.

Skladany’s Punting Features
In Freshman Grid Scrimmages

As ﬁrst scrimmage sessions in the
1940 drills for freshman football
men begin this week, the eyes and
hopes of the coaching staff are rest-
ing on the sturdy shoulders and
the good right leg of halfback Eddie
Skladany.

Head Coach Charley Bowser has
paid handsome Eddie the rare com-
pliment of personally instructing
him in the ﬁne art of punting. And
Eddie has responded by kicking
great booming spirals 50 and 60
yards down the ﬁeld. Pitt’s newest
Skladany, brother of all-American
Joe, promises to give the Panthers
21 triple—t.hreat back, the ﬁrst in
many years.

Future’ Pitt teams will be well. .

Pitt.-Missouri
Clash Looms

As Air Battle

Both Clubs Display
Powerful Offenses

By Ben Foote

Plenty of fur should ﬂy in Sat-
urday’s tussle between the Panther
and the Tiger on the Stadium grid-
iron when Pitt plays host to Mis-
souri.

Both outfits are evenly matched,
boasting a’ good offense and lacking
a defense. For the second time,
though, in as many weeks, the Pitt
team must build up an anti-air-
craft plan to combat a powerful
aerial attack.

One of the nation’s outstanding
passers, all-American Paul Christ-
man heads the Tiger sky forces and
if the local aerial defense units are
as weak as last Saturday in Colum-
bus, Christman’s devastating arm
will rain destruction on the locals.
Graduation Takes Four Ends

To be sure, the cocky Missouri
quarterback has lost by graduation

.f'ri1‘i1“ 'of"Ftis"‘bélst receiver“s,"‘ia6Iudia*g'

the famous Orf twins and Blaine
Currence, but last Saturday against
St. Louis, Christman tossed four
touchdown passes and scored an-
other one himself as his team won,
40-26. In addition to Passin’ Paul’s
efforts, the ‘cause of the Big Six
champs was aided and abetted by
the efforts of one Bill Cunningham,
blasting junior fullback.

From tackle to tackle the Mis-
souri line is as rock-ribbed as was
the 1939 front rank. Two smashing
tackles, Jack Landers and Bob
Wakeman, combine weight and
agility with amazing coordination,
and they have a sophomore cohort,
brawny Vern Lightfoot, who can
give them able assistance. At guard,
Captain Jack Crocker is 180 pounds
of dynamite. A steel-ﬁbered center
Don Dunchek seems to be every-
where when he back up the line.
Rounding out the center trio, soph-
omore Bill Ellis ﬁlls the left guard
slot.

Kracum Threatens Missouri

Missouri, however, can’t lug the
pigskin all day, and when George
Kracum, aptly named Pitt fullback,
gets his hand on the leather, his
bone-crushing line smashes should
be as havoc-wreaking as Christ-
man’s pitches.

Bill Nosker, rugged Ohio State
guard, declared that “crack—em”
Kracum was tougher to bring down
than any back he has ever faced
but Tom Harmon, the Dazzling
Wolverine. Nosker should know if
anyone, for the Buckeye guard was
right in the path of Kracum’s
charging onslaughts. Most of the
grid critics in attendance at the
Ohio State fracas dubbed Kracum
the outstanding back on the ﬁeld.

Ohio State players also declared
that the Pit team was much tough-
er than the score of Saturday’s clash
indicated and declared they had
plenty of trouble holding the run-
ning attack of coach Charley Bow-
ser’s boys in check.

Varsity Letter Group
Holds First Meeting

There will be a meeting of the
Panther club in 208 Cathedral Fri-
day, 4 to 3 o’clock. The Panther
club, patterned after the University
of 1\/lichigan’s varsity “M” club,
was organized last year by Ben
Grady, varsity swimming coach, for
the varsity lettermen of Pitt.

Joe Kristufek, C40, club presi-

dent and former tennis captain, will
be in charge of the -meeting; All
undergraduate lettermen are asked

Phi Gamma Delta, Punks Prepare

To Defend 1940 Intramural Crowns

With the fall intramural sports program nearing its start, the intra-
mural touch football and speedball champions of last year, the Punks
and the Phi Gams, are preparing to re-enter the intramural wars in a
determined effort to retain their 1939 titles.

Phi Gamma Delta, winner of the 1939 fraternity All-Point trophy,
was hit harder by graduation than any other club in intramural com-

petition. The Fijis, with a powerful
veteran team lead by such stal-
warts as Bill Edmunds, “Stoney”
Bitner, Ray Dimit, Jack Eitel, and
“Chris” Watson, won the fraternity
crown. They then met the unde-
feated Punks, victors in the Inde-
pendent race, but were beaten two
out of three games.

Phi Delts, Phi Kaps Favored.

The Phi Delt and Phi Kappa elev-
ens were runnersup in the I-F bat-
tle, and made a credible showing
against the Phi Garns. These two
teams will be favorites in the fra-
ternity league as A1 Holbrook, Bill
Mansﬁeld, and Paul MacNeill are
the only regulars returning to the
I-F crown bearers.

On the speedball front, Phi Gam-

_ ma Delta A_. C. again won,th_e_ crown.

B.6'bb'y' Thurbon,' halfback‘ of the
varsity football team, was the out-
standing man on the squad. Bill
Colvin teamed with the last year
senior row of Edmunds, Dimit, Eitel,
and Watson to bring the cup to
their Wallingford street home.

Punks Best on Grid in '39

Doctor Carlson’s ice cream eaters
copped the all-Intramural touch
football crown under the name of
the Punks. Their name did not ﬁt
their play for they stamped them-
selves as the best touch football
team ever to play on the Trees gym
ﬁeld.

The Punks completely outclassed
every opponent in the independent
Phi Gams. This year they should
be as good as ever for they lose

Marsh Sees Industrial

Conscription

as Solution

To U. 5. Draft Problem

The only safe way out of the
present national military program
is the conscription of all ﬁnancial
and industrial resources, according
to Benjamin C. Marsh, executive
secretary of the People’s Lobby,
Inc.

Visiting the University on a tour
across the country, Mr. Marsh
paused long enough to explain the
legislative program he has been
lobbying for in the Capitol, and his
more recent views on conscription
and its ramiﬁcations.

“All we have to do to end un-
employment in the U. S. is to put
ﬁve million men in the conscript
army, and ﬁve million more at work
producing battleships, cruisers, sub-
marines, airplanes, and munitions,
for the conscript forces. These con-
script forces would then attempt to
hunt down an enemy, for I don’t
believe we should fear Germanor
Japanese aggression,” he said.

“Until we elect a congress which
won‘t enact such a thing as the con-
scription law, and a president with
conscience enough to veto it, we
must -do our best to make the law
a success.” However, lVlr. Marsh
was skeptical that the present. con-
scription principle .was a demo-
cratic procedure.

“The only alternative until the
law -is“repealed is the conscription
of all industry by the government,
who would grant management con-
trol to engineers and_ technicians,
eliminating both the politicians, and
the proﬁt-mongers.

“We must recognize that indus-
try cannot use all the unemployed
under either a peace or war econ-
omy. We are doomed to a stand-
ing army of some ﬁve or ten mil-
lion unemployed, in spite of pri-
vate industrial employment, unless
government-—chieﬂy the federal
government—-expands its cultural
program. ‘College men and women
should be particularly interested in
a governmental cultural program-—
entailing expenditure of billions of
dollars annually on health, reaction,
and public services as well as aca-
demic and scientiﬁc instruction.

“Such training would qualify
graduates for other jobs than taxi
drivers and chambermaids,” he said.

“Unless the techniques and con-
trols of the present military pro-

gram are changed, we will have to
conscript the income of the pres-
ent and the next two generations
to pay for post-New Deal assinin-
ity.”

The 1941 legislative program of
the People’s Lobby is based on sev-

-en concepts: heavy progressive tax-

ation of incomes, personal and cor-
porate, of estates and of land value,
reduction or repeal of consumption
taxes; government marketing and
farming corporations; socialization
of banking and credit; and of coal,
oil, water power and gas.

The program also dealt with so-
cialization of the steel industry, gov-
ernment ownership of the railroads,
legislation and measures to reduce
the speculative selling price of land,
heavy debts ‘and interest charges-,
and over-capitalization; and inter-
national cooperation. , .

More prominent supporters of the
People’s Lobby, a private agency
organized to ‘promote ‘specific social
and economic programs, are‘ John
Dewey, until“ recently honorary
president of the organization; Gar-
ner Jackson, Rev. Francis J. Mc-
Connell, Harry Elmer Barnes, Stu-
art Chase, Jerome‘.Davis, Harry P.
Fairchild, and "Harry Laidler.

Students Demand
War-Time Books

If library book demands mean
anything, Pitt students’ chief inter-
est is the war and the European sit-
uation.

Demand for some international
books is so great that the library is
holding a number of them on re-
serve until next week, Mrs. J. H.
Dice, Alldred room librarian, stated.

Among these volumes are: “Lights
Go Down,” by Erika Mann, a story
of life in present—day Germany;
“End of an Armistice,” by G. K.
Chesterton, a story of the rise of
the Hitler regime; “Failure of a
Mission,” by Sir Neville I-Iender-
son; and “Strategy of Terror,” by
Edmund Taylor. Books on Amer-
ican affairs are: “The American
Front,” by Duncan Aikman, a book
advocating Pan-American relations;

and “Propaganda in the United
States,” a volume analyzing war
propaganda.

Hospital

Continued from page one

the laboratory building addition to
the Presbyterian General hospital
have to be built. Although plans
are being considered, no deﬁnite
announcement has been made as to
when actual construction will be-
gin.

About 22 years ago two men, Dr
Ogden M. Edwards Jr., then acting
dean of the School of Medicine and
chairman of the medical commit-
tee of the Board of Trustees, and

.Dr.- R. It. Huggins, then associate

proﬂessor o1‘ gynecology, started
plans for a medical center which
would not only serve the.commun-
ity, but also serve the cause of med-
ical education.

Dr. John G. Bowman shared their
hopes and gave his assistance to-
ward a goal which is steadily being
realized. ._

These men planned that the hos-
pitals should be built in close prox-
imity; the administration should be
kept separate, but efforts should be
coordinated; and that they might
serve the. cause of medical educa-
tion. In the buildingsof the med-
ical center students of nursing and
medicine . should observe and de-
velop surgery and medical ‘treat-
ment. , , .

The University purchased a full
city block, the Porter estate, for the
health center . site. .The site is
bounded.by Fifth avenue, Lothrop
street, Terrace place, and DeSoto
street, south of Pitt stadium. Space

1 was set aside for-each hospital.

Since the purchase of the land,
however, the_Pitt medical center
has grown into a reality until the
construction of only two more build-
ings, aside fromthe Municipal hos-

pital, will complete the center.
