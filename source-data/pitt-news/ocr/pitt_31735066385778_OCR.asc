Frats 'little sister programs underfire

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

Many national chapters of fraternities, as
well as the National Inter—Fraternity Council,
are regulating or abolishing little-sister
programs from a vast majority of fraternities.

At an NIC conference held in December
1987, the NIC resolved that they believe little-
sister groups are not desirable to the collegiate
chapters of men’s fraternities and urged all
member fraternities to work with their
chapters to eliminate little—sister programs at
the earliest possible time.

Recently, all fraternities at the University of
Missouri at Columbia were forced by
university officials to cease little—sister
programs after four alleged rape cases
involving fraternity brothers and other female
guests at a party.

However, the alleged rape cases were not
the only reason that UMC officials banned
little sisters. The decision also stemmed from
the NIC’s recommendation to its members in

1987 and the trend that most fraternities are I

following, according to officials at UMC.
“The environment surrounding the little-
sister programs makes it more conducive for
sexual abuse or alcohol abuse. [The little-
sister program] was not conducive with good

male/ female relationships,” said Don Graham,
associate director of residential life at UMC;

“It didn’t seem appropriate. Females were
being treated as objects, not as human beings,”
Graham continued.

The directors of residential life at UMC

allowed any little—sister organization that
wished to appeal the decision the opportunity
to do so by submitting a proposal to the
student government.
Of the 50 chapters on campus with houses,
only FarmHouse fraternity’s little sisters have
appealed to be recognized as a student
group, according to Graham.

According to the NIC resolution, “little
sisters are inconsistent with the concept and
philosophy of separate and equal women’s.
fraternities.” _

The resolution says that little—sister groups
divert resources of the chapter such as time,
effort and money. Little sisters also distract
members from their duties in the chapter and
create disharmony, according to the
resolution.

According to Bob Biggs, director of chapter
services for Phi Delta Theta, “[Little sisters]
dilute the purpose of fraternities.” Biggs also
said that when their international chapter
banned little—sister programs, of their 171
chapters, less than 75 had little sisters, and

only one chapter wanted to phase out their
little-sister program instead of terminating it
immediately.

Sydney Dunn, executive vice president of
Alpha Epsilon Pi said, ‘‘I don’t believe there
are any benefits [in having little sisters]. Little
sisters cause dissention in the chapter and
tear down the sorority system.”

Recently, sorority members of Kappa Delta
at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln passed
a resolution prohibiting their members from
also being involved with women’s auxiliary
groups, such as little-sister groups. This
resolution will go into effect beginning in the
fall semester of 1992.

No one is positive as to the origin of little
sisters. Two theories are prevalent among
many different brothers of various fraternities.

One theory is that little sisters started when
many fraternities had house mothers. Sisters
and girlfriends of brothers in the fraternity
would assist the house mother with her
“duties.”

The other theory is basically the same, but
there is no mention of a house mother, only
a group of girls related in some way to the
brothers of the fraternity who formed an
actual “group.”

At Pitt, only about seven of the fraternities

When Guy Davis performed in a packed auditorium in Pitt’s Frick

Guy’s story was simple, but his purpose was very serious.

“All of my stories in Mud Surfing may seem to be about one thing
but they are really about something much larger. They are about love
or the absence of it,” he said

Mud Surfing is a one act, one man show written by Guy. He

have both been in numerous movies and plays. They also co-

organ donation drive

VOLUME EIGH-F, I NINE-O

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
Staff Writer

Phi Delta Chi, Pitt’s pharmacy
fraternity, is working with the
Pittsburgh Transplant Foundation
to promote organ—donor
awareness among university
students.

A Gallup Poll reported that 80
percent of Americans would
donate their organs after death,
but only 17 percent of Americans
actually have donor cards.

“A donor card is like pledging,”
said Scott Cowan, senior
procurement technician at the
Pittsburgh Transplant Foundation.
If a person decides that he wants

to donate any of his organs or
tissues after death, he is asked to
fill out a pledge card. This card is
kept in the donor’s wallet, so that
in case of an accident, the person’s
organs or tissues can be retrieved.
Also, all donors put stickers on
their driver’s licenses to identify
them as donors.

According to Cowan, most
people are not informed about
how the organ-donation system
works. “It’s a surgical procedure,”
said Cowan. “It’s done in an
operating room.”

After a donor dies, tissues and
organs are removed by a trained
medical staff. The organs removed
do not leave any noticeable scars.

“They have the utmost respect
for the body. You can have an
open—casket funeral,” Cowan said.

Phi Delta Chi got involved with
the Pittsburgh Transplant
Foundation after the fraternity
decided to sponsor the organ
challenge. “One of the other
brothers, Bill Hargenroder, came
up with the idea,” said Scott
Claycomb, professional-affairs
chairman for the fraternity.

“We’re promoting pharmacy by
challenging other majors at Pitt,”
said Claycomb. “The major that
gets the most signed-up people
will get a plaque.”

Claycomb warns potential
donors that their decision to

donate should be discussed with
a family member or a close
relative. “We want people to talk
it over with a close relative. We
don’t want people to do this on a
whim,” said Claycomb.

“You can donate anywhere in v

the United States,” Cowan stated.
A national computer system is set
up to match donor organs to
patients that need a transplant.
This system, called the United
Network for Organ Sharing, has
its national headquarters in
Richmond, Va.

Phi Delta Chi is ending the
donor challenge with a balloon
launch on Friday.

March 21, 1987

Teen-age gangs
terrorized Oakland
Avenue. An estimated 150
youths began throwing
bottles and cans when
asked to clear the street,
causing $70 worth of
damage to Peter’s Pub and
injuring several of the bar’s
patrons. “It was like
nothing I've ever seen,”
said Bob Bonessa,

March 19 — A student living in
Tower B reported that on the first
two days of the month an
unknown person or persons

 

made two unauthorized calls to
Dunham, N.C., on his phone
account.

March 19 ——- Campus police
responded to a disturbance call
in a second-floor hallway of a
building on Atwood Street. A
man was in an argument with
two other men. The man slammed
a door against a wall and punched
the wall several times. There was
a very strong smell of alcohol on

the man, and he was having
trouble walking. He was arrested
for public intoxication. The men
were all arguing about which
one of them would drive home.

March 20 — A student living in
Tower B said that she received
three harassing phone calls from
a man four weeks ago, last week
and then on Tuesday. The man
left messages on the student's
answering machine, one of them
saying, “I want you.”

Opinion among fraternities at
Pitt varies in the degree to which
little sisters function in the
fraternity and whether or not
they are an asset to the fraternity.

“They do function as an asset.
They are very active,” Jim
Venturella, president of Sigma
Chi, said. “Our nationals don’t

 

recognize [little sistersl, but they
haven't banned them.”

However, some other
fraternities feel that little sisters
aren’t as valuable. “We're thinking
about getting rid of them,” said
Frank Cararie, a brother at Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. “After they’re
initiated, they’re never around.
To tell you the truth, I don’t see
what they do. I really don’t think
they earn their letters.”

Seniors’ response to our student loans
  has been overwhelming.

Everyone's head~over-heels about
Pittsburgh National’s consolidation
student loans and graduate school

loans.

That’s because with a Pittsburgh
National consolidation student loan,
you can cram all your eligible student
loans into one.* And, with the Student
Loan Network Consolidation Program,
you can choose the repayment option
that gives you the lowest possible
monthly payment available.

Or, if you're headed to graduate

school and need financing that won't
cost you an arm and a leg, apply for a
Supplemental Loan for Students (SLS)

from Pittsburgh National. With an SLS

loan, you can defer repayment until
after you leave school. And our current
rate is just 11.75%. That's lower than
most other banks.

So, avoid the crush of higher educa-
tion costs after graduation. Beat the
rush by calling now.

express who we are, but to open
doors through education through
who we are,” said Ossie. Dee
said that the purpose of their trip
was to help establish a better
understanding of the minority
experience in America.

Guy also sang two songs, which
they audience participated in. Guy
said that his show is fiction but is
based on truth.

“These stories are not meant to
point fingers but rather to get at
root causes,” he said, immediately
prior to his story about “the first

two times I ever got called a?

nigger.” ,
Before the performance, the

* family spoke about the role that

blacks now play in the
entertainment industry. “There
have been some changes. There
are other avenues of exposure

like cable television. There is
more competition within the
system and when there is
competition within the insiders,
the outsiders often get a break,”
he said.

Both father and son commented
on black director Spike Lee. Ossie
said that he thought Lee should
have been nominated for an Oscar
for his film, Do The Right Thing,
which Dee starred in.

“I do think that Spike Lee got a
raw deal in the Oscar nominations
but it's not anything that we didn't
expect,” Ossie said.

Guy added that economics play
a role in the decision process.

“It's harder on a black film‘
maker when he flops because
the powers that be understand
one language and that's profit. If
they can make money out of a
film maker that's good,” he said.

  Condom issue leaves Pitt

unprotected in logo war

Dina Pearlman and Emily Parker, two Carnegie Mellon
University seniors, have been accused of violating Pitt’s li-

. censing policy by using the university logo to sell “Primo

Panther Condoms” without its permission.

The controversy surrounds a package which the girls
have been promoting on the Pitt campus during the past
three weeks. The package features a picture of a panther

’ putting a condom on its tail.
According to Mary Bonach, director of book centers, .

“Anyone who wants to use the logo has to apply for a
license before using it. There is a procedure that everyone
has to follow.” .

However, the two girls claim that they are not using the
Pitt logo. Pearlman said, ?‘It is a panther logo, not a Pitt
one. Nowhere on the condom does it say Pitt. The colors
on the package aren’t even Pitt’s. Sure, they’re blue and
gold, but they are nowhere near the same shade that Pitt
uses. This is ridiculous.”

The girls argue, “How many high schools and colleges

- around use the panther? It isn’t just Pitt; that’s for sure.” It’s

surely no coincidence that they happen to be selling
“Primo Panther Condoms” on a campus where the logo
is also a panther. However, that’s business —— something

' the university can surely relate to. Indeed, the profit

motive becomes evident on both sides when one consid-
ers that the university reaps, the benefits of a 6-percent
charge on a company’s gross benefit on items sporting the
Pitt logo. 

The university was able to .close the University Shop in

order to replace it with one of its own. Although the action

‘may seem nasty and unsympathetic to the former owner
of the University Shop, it was still legal — the university
owned it. It would seem hypocritical for the university to
complain about the logo situation if it had no basis to its
argument, if the girls’ logo is different from Pitt’s, then it
apparently doesn't.

This is not an ethical or moral question, nor one of
greed. It is a legal question. The argument over the logo
is a simple one: Is the panther on the logo the Pitt panther
or not? Keep in mind that the panther used by the students
can be similar to the Pitt one, as long as it is not identical.
They must be careful enough in their choice of panther
to successfully and legally refute any claims that it is the
same panther as the Pitt one. This is not sneaky; it’s done
all the time. Consider the beer cans used in movies and
television; they look exactly like Budweiser beer cans, but
they’re not. _

The two CMU students may be only a half an inch on
the right side of the logo rule,  ‘that’s all they need.

Religion and cafeteria etiqu

A wise man once said that you
can say anything you want to
anybody you want, as long as
you don’t discuss religion or poli-
tics. These are words to live by.

Not long ago, I walked into the
Chateau de Cafeteria B and sat
down at a table to eat my  uh,
whatever. I knew a few of the
guys who were there, so I thought
I was in for a relatively pleasant
lunchroom conversation. I sup-
pose I should've been suspicious
when one of the guys offered me
his seat, only to move to the -other
end of the table, but I wasn’t. I
should have noticed that one of
the other guys had removed his
hearing aid, but I didn’t. As a
result, I have nobody to blame
for getting into this entirely un-
comfortable situation but myself.

Upon taking a seat, one of the '
, guys on my left (No. 1)‘ turned to

me and asked me what my relig-
ious denomination was. I said

Roman Catholic. The guy laughed. ‘

No, he LAUGHED. As I am a
peaceable guy, I just politely
turned away from him and struck
up a conversation with the guy to
my right. That was a smart move,
because one of the other guys
(No. 2) didn’t ignore the happy
camper, and the two got into a

Kappa Delta Rho alive and well .

We are writing in response to
the article, “There Is More to
Greeks Than Meets the Eye,” by
Sandra Kramer, published in the
perspective section of the March
19 edition of The Pitt News. We
feel there are a few points which
need to be addressed to alleviate
any misconceptions.

Ja ckets are currently being worn
by initiated brothers from various
chapters and approximately 40
percent of our membership is
comprised of transfers from these
academic institutions  of which
include the University of Pitts-
burgh at Greensburg, Penn State,
Gannon University and Cornell
University.

To quote the article, “Having
never gone through the logistics
involved with the colonization
with both its nationals and Pitt’s
IFC ...” We have been an estab-

very heated debate. A third guy
(No. 3), who had apparently been
involved in this discussion from
the beginning, challenged No. 2
to defend his faith right there at
the table amongst the french fries
and chicken legs. No. 2 didn’t

 

want to discuss it any further. But
it was too late. He was already
mired in the hell of thinking
people. The two baited him,
pressed him, scoffed at him and
generally harassed him for the
rest of the meal. No. 2 actually
gave up, agreed with everything
they said, and even promised to
convert in the morning if they
would just leave him alone. But
they didn’t give up. Giving in
was not the answer, they said.
Knowing oneself and one’s own
beliefs was the answer. i

Similarly, two days ago, I was

sitting around in Chateau de.

Cafeteria C for a change of pace
when one of my friends stopped
by. When this person found out
I wrote for the illustrious Pitt
News, she launched into a tirade

lished group of intent with the
national headquarters of Kappa
Delta Rho since September of
1989 and have already submitted

 

a petition to the IFC. Further-
more, the executive director of
KDR is scheduled to present the
ideals behind the KDR national

_ fraternity to members of the Gavel

Club (the organization of Pitt’s
fraternity presidents).

The article also states, “With—
out colonization and registering
with the IFC, Kappa Delta Rho
will not receive the support of
Pitt’s established chapters,” and
lists numerous activities which
we are not involved with at pres-
ent. The only reason we have not
been involved is because our

that resembled the Cliffs Notes
of Jewish dogma. And there I sat
with a hamburger. Talk about
awkward! I kept expecting her to
spin her head around 360 de-
grees and start throwing up all
over the place (which wouldn’t
have caused any real alarm since
we were in the Towers caf).
Apparently, she was upset by the
article that ran on March 15. Like
I had anything to do with that,
right? I just work here.

I am an open-minded guy. But
call me crazy, I don't think the
cafeteria is the place to debate
the existence of God — espe-
cially if you want to convince

people there is one. And some-

thing tells me there has got to be
a better way of convincing some-
one than attacking them at the
dinner table. Whatever happened
to civilization? Give the devout a
soapbox and a lecture hall, but
not a captive audience.

I had always viewed religious
persecution as somebody op-

pressing somebody else because ”

of his or her beliefs. Now I have
witnessed the ﬂip side of this
coin: someone using his or her
beliefs to harass another person.
I guess you could sayl have been
enlightened. A

status is still being reviewed by
the IFC. It should be noted that

we have been invited to have

representatives attend IFC meet-
ings and have done so with per-
fect attendance.

Although Ms. Kra'mer’s con-
cern is most certainly genuine, it
is also unfounded. We relish the
idea of acceptance and future
involvement in all facets of the
Greek community. Our intention
and position have been grossly
misrepresented.

President

NCAA considers changing one-and-one bonus situation

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

In the Big East tournament two
weeks ago, Providence was down
by 10 to Georgetown. Four
minutes and 16 seconds
remained. With a 17-10 record,
the Friars were in desperate need
of a miracle to raise some
eyebrows on the NCAA
tournament selection committee.
A Friar victory was not mandatory
for a possible NCAA tournament
bid, just an impressive showing
against the mighty Hoyas.

They began to foul Georgetown
intentionally. Providence had
already committed at least seven
fouls in the half, putting the Hoyas
“in the bonus.” Thus, Georgetown
was awarded a one—and-one free-
throw attempt with each Friar
foul through the end of the game.

The fouling tactic was used in
hope that the Hoyas would fhiss
their free throws so Providence
could get the ball back and cut
the deficit. The Hoyas, normally
a great free- throw shooting team,
shot poorly, enabling the Friars
to score and get back in the
game.

The ploy the Friars used is a
common desperation tactic for
the losing team to use late in a

game, but it rarely works. The
team being fouled usually makes
its foul shots and takes an even
larger lead. Usually, all it does is
cause a game to last longer. The
Friars’ strategy caused the final
4:16 to take close to 40 minutes to
play.

But this time it worked.
Although Providence lost by one,
78-77, it did get an invitation to
college basketball’s March party.

It was a courageous effort by
the Friars to get back in the game,
but they did it in a way which
makes some basketball purists
cringe.

Is this really basketball? Is it
necessary to force a team to win
a game by hitting its free throws
after it has beaten a team all over
the floor for the first 35 minutes?

Ask any coach what he thinks
about the strategy, and he will
give totally different answers in
differentsituations, depending on
whether he won or lost.

“When I'm ahead, I don’t like
it, butwhen I’m behind, I love it,”
said Friar Coach Rick Barnes.

Georgetown Coach John
Thompson agrees.

“We don’t tell the truth with
things like that.”

This tactic has been used by

llt's hi h te to abort the six-foul rule in Big East

 

\\

'»'%¢.'<§§§\\~\\'\\'\».\\‘-

Pitt News File photo
The six-foul rule in conference play may be keeping big men in the game too long.

It looks like Pitt Coach Paul Evans was right. He has said from the
beginning that he is not in favor of the six-foul rule for a player’s
ejection in the Big East.

With all of the rule changes that have taken place in college
basketball in past years, the six-foul rule has proven to be the most
ludicrous.

The change was basically instituted to promote physical play under
the boards and to keep each team’s big men in the game longer. For
example, John Thompson’s Hoyas can play extremely physical
basketball, a la Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, for most
of the game.

These two giants can battle it out with the likes of say, Panthers
Bobby Martin and Brian Shorter
or Orangemen Billy Owens and
Derrick Coleman with almost
no fear of fouling out of the
game.

Six fouls is a lot to give
over the course of 40 minutes. A
player really does not have to
worry about foul trouble until
he has four. Then he may play
a little more conservatively. But
with the ancient technique of
substituting, players are virtually
assured of an extremely physical
game during all the minutes
they see action.

Now, playing physical
basketball is an integral part of
the game and makes it a more exciting event to watch. However,
what has suffered the most as a result of the six-foul rule is strategy.

Rarely are teams ever lacking their big man. And the big men
around the league are what make some Big East teams as successful
as they are. However, what also made teams great in the past was
their ability to survive without their big men, who were occasionally
riding the pine because they were playing a little too aggressively.

Simple numbers will illustrate what a wide open, play-your-best-
players-all-the-time game college basketball has become. Take Pitt,
for example. Thirteen players saw action during at least one point in
the season. Pitt played a total of 29 games during the 1989-90 season
and incurred only 10, count ‘em, 10, foul-outs during the year.

That’s unbelievable. There were only 10 separate instances of
players fouling out of the game all season. Just think about that.

Simply from covering hoop games, I was able to see how physical

See Fouls, page 8

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21, 1990

Fouls

Continued from page 7
the game has become. During
the Pitt—Georgetown game at the
Civic Arena this year, Shorter,
Mourning and Darren
Morningstar were all elbowing
each other, taking cheap shots
and provoking each other during

‘ the first half.

The action carried over into the
second half, and the entire game
could have taken on a new

perspective with about six
minutes to go.

At 6:14, Shorter dunked a
Darelle Porter alley—oop pass and
was blatantly fouled by Mourning.
That was Mourning’s fifth
personal. GONE according to
other conference rules. But no,
not in the Big East.

Now if you take Alonzo
Mourning out of the game, you
remove a pretty good player and

certainly increase your
opponent’s chance of staging a
comeback.

In such a physical game, key
players have a good chance of
picking up a fifth foul. However,
the probability of picking up a
sixth foul is greatly diminished.

Another aspect of Big East
games which has changed is free
throws.

With six fouls to give for every

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, March 21, 1990

player from the start of the game,
players who are not in foul trouble
may hack at will in order to send
their opponents to the line in the
hope that they will miss the
ensuing free throws.

The games have taken longer
as a result, and the one—and—one
bonus situation is being taken
full, perhaps excessive, advantage
of.

Call me a purist, but the Big

East should seriously consider
recalling the six—foul rule. It would
be nice to see good, old—fashioned
strategy resurface as a result of
key players in foul trouble.

The entire way the game is
played would change drastically,
to the point where coaches may

not be able to count on their big, ‘ l

aggressive players in the game
most of the way.

the losing team in virtually all
games in the NCAA tournament

this year and every year. It does

not matter if Towson State is
losing by 20 to Oklahoma with
two minutes to play. The team
will foul in desperation hoping to
make, say, seven three- pointers
while the Sooners miss all scoring
opportunities, thus scoring the
upset victory.

‘However, the end of games
have taken so long with rarely a
change in the outcome, that the
NCAA may consider a possible
rule change for teams that are in
the bonus.

“I think it's getting out of hand, ”
said Jarrett Durham, coach of
Robert Morris, who was
eliminated from the NCAA
tournament by Kansas in the first
round. “I would like to have the
option of taking the ball out of
bounds.” I

The NCAA rules committee will
seriously consider a rule change
when they meet at the Final Four
in Denver, March 31 to April 2.
Besides the option of either taking

the ball out of bounds or shooting
free throws, there have been other
suggestions. Those suggestions
include awarding a two-shot free
throw instead of one-and—one for
teams in the bonus (same as the
NBA) or awarding two shots and
possession of the ball, or making
the 10th team foul in a half a two-
shot bonus in addition to the
seven-foul one-and—one bonus.
“There have been various
suggestions to cut down the time
it takes to play the last part of a
game; it's something that will be
discussed,” said Ed Steitz,

secretary editor for the NCAA’

men’s basketball rules committee.

Any changes may be in the
form of an experiment. The NCAA
would allow conferences to
experiment with the rule if they
wish, much like the way this
year's six-foul rule for a players
ejection was handled. I I

The Big East, along with the
Southeastern, Trans—Am/erican
and Colonial conferences, used
the six-foul rule this year. That
rule will also be reviewed by the
NCAA at the Final Four.

There have been many
significant rule changes in college
basketball recently.

“Our game is a great game right
now,”. said Steitz. “The inclusion
of the 4S—second shot clock and
the three—point line have done
what they were supposed to do,
that is, create more upsets.
Nothing has had or will have the
impact in the next 50 years the
way the three—point field goal has
had. It is the most positive
revolutionary change since 1937. ”

In 1937, the NCAA eliminated a
rule which required a jump ball
after every score.

Steitz feels the recent surge of
rule changes has had a positive
inﬂuence on the game.

“No one is going to dominate
the game today. It is good to have
new faces come to the Final Four.
Before the shot clock and three-

point line, the games were lower

scoring. The games actually
started to become boring.

“We have a great game. Our
game is really at a high. But we
still have to handle the last four
minutes of a game,” he added.

Major League Baseball not ready for expansion

As a result of the recent baseball
negotiations, major-league
baseball will soon announce plans
for the expansion of two teams in
the National League, with the
possibility of more teams being
added by the turn of the century.

The players’ union has
succeeded in creating more jobs
for its members. So much for the
prestige of making it to the big
leagues..

But baseball is not the only
sport that will expand. Hockey
plans to expand by seven "teams
by the year 2000. Basketball has
just completed a four-team
expansion, and football has always
kicked the idea around.

Expansion is very tempting for
baseball at this point in its history.
America’s pastime has not
expanded since 1976, when the
Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle
Mariners joined the American
League. The National League last
expanded in 1969 with the
addition of. the Montreal Expos
and San Diego Padres.

Pl*T*T
l’ll()(i|l\.\l
(‘()l§\'(‘|l.

>1.

Cities across North America are
building multi—purpose domes
complete with retractable roofs
and shopping malls.

Our nation’s capital is crying
for a team. Washington, D. C. has
not seen major-league baseball
since 1968; one year later, the
Washington Senators moved to
Texas.

Congress has even attempted
to force major—league baseball to
expand to D.C. Our own political
system has threatened to take
measures which would force
expansion. Congress would be
forcing something which would
be damaging the game.

Expansion is dangerous for
baseball. Talent will be spread
too thinly. Every team already
has three or four Rafael Belliards
and John Cangelosis on their
roster. Expansion would draw
players from T riple—A level who
do not deserve to be on a major-
league roster. i

These players would have to
face guys like Orel Hershiser and

Wade Boggs. Worse yet,
Hershiser and Boggs would have
to face undeserving talent.

_ Every year baseball fans
anticipate the beginning of a
long season. They ponder
questions like, “Will anyone hit
.400 this year?” and “Will there
be a pitcher who wins 30 games?”

etc.

This kind of anticipation is
what makes baseball unique from
other sports. If baseball expands
at a significant pace over the
next 10 years, these kinds of
questions will no longer have to
be asked.

If baseball has over 50 teams
by the year 2000 (there are 26
now), batting averages will range

from .400 for the league leaders
to somewhere in the .1003 for
players like Pirates third baseman
Jeff King. King hit abysmally like
that last year.

Pitchers’ earned-run /averages
will range from under 2.00 for
stars like Dave Stewart and Mark
Langston to near 7.00 for Edwin
Correa. And that 7.00 ERA will
earn a roster spot on a major-
league team. ‘

Baseball is not ready to expand.
Basketball was. Hockey is.

Basketball added four teams.
With 12 players on a roster, that's
48 more players in the league --
not as significant a difference as
baseball, which has 24-man
rosters. Although the Minnesota
Timberwolves are not quite ready
to battle for a playoff spot, they
have shown they can play with
the Lakers and Pistons.

Basketball was ready.

Hpckey has 20 men on a team.
Expansion of seven teams will
add 140 players to NHL rosters.
That is a significant difference.

But hockey’s expansion is in

response to the importation of
more European-born players and
the increase of American—born
hockey talent, which has taken
away from Canadian talent.

Hockey is ready.

Where will baseball find its
talent? There has been neither an
overwhelming increase of
American baseball talent nor any
imported talent.

Baseball is not ready for
expansion, despite pressures from
its players’ union or congress.
Plans for any more expansion
would have to be put off for years
to come after the current plans
are finished.

Sports cannot expand forever;
it will run out of cities and people.

Otherwise, 100 years from now
baseball fans will be anticipating
that great opening~day match-up
between the Walla Walla
Wallbangers and the Kalamazoo
Kangaroos. ’
