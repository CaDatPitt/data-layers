New ODK Senior
Award Continues
Former Tradition

 

Senior Men’s Election In March
Will Determine Popularity
Of Honor Candidates

First Planned In 1933

On Tap Day, May 3, the winner of
the first Senior ODK award will be
announced to the campus, George
Roll, I-3d35, president of the l1Q_nOI‘«'1I‘Y
all-activities 1‘raternity, announced
Saturday.

Planned by ODK to continue the
tradition of the former George W'har-
ton Pepper p-ri_ze and the University
award, the new system will recog-
nize the graduating man deemed most
outstanding. Final choice of the win-
ner will be made by a committee in-
cluding Dr. Vincent TV. Lanfear, dean
of men, one recent alumnus member
of ODK, and three faculty members.

Senior men, Roll disclosed, will vote
for the man they consider most wor-
thy. The results of the election,
which will be held during the first
week of March, will aid the selecting
committee in gauging the popularity
of the candidates. It is explained that
all men receiving one vote or more
in the balloting will be considered for
the honor.

Three junior members of ODK and
ﬁve junior men in SFA have been
chosen by R011 to plan the senior
‘March election. VVorking with Israel
L. Goldberg‘, C, chairman, will be
Charles A. Ruch, C, Ellis H. Tump-
son, BA, Charles B. Holstein, C, Jo-
seph L. Rodgers, BA, George Strong,
0, Charles Herald, C, and James Ball-
entine, C. Using SFA election cards
adopted this semester, the committee
begins today to insure a fair vote.

The man chosen will be named on
the‘”"basi's of scholarship, leadership,
activities record, service to the Uni-
versity, character and social bearing.
H. Ellsworth Miller, BA35, is co-
operating with Roll and Endicott A.
Batchelder, secretary of the organiza-
tion, in dI‘awing.up_ a complete elec-
tion code.

The name of tlrewinning ‘senior
will be cut into a granite block, which
will form part of the border of an
ODK walk near the Cathedral. Al-
though plans for the walk have not
been completed, it is believed that the
first‘ stones in the-outer rim will’in-
clude names of Pepper prize and Uni-
versity award recipients.

A gap of several years separates the
last award from the 1935 one. After
May, 1932, when Jack Stirling re-
ceived the honor, no recognition was
accorded the leading male graduate.
The activities fraternity originally
suggested continuance of the tradition
in its 15-point plan for 1933-34. The
idea was temporarily dropped, but re-
vived last fall.

‘Men graduating in the year Sep-
tember 1, 1934, to August 31, 1935, will
be eligible, preliminary code reports
show. Thus mid-year men who com-
pleted their workby February, as
well as those who will round out their
120 hours during the Summer Ses-
sion, will be considered along -with
the June class.

Immediately after the results of
the senior voting are obtained, the
group headed by -Dr. =Lanfear will be-
gin evaluating fourth-year men. By
March 31, the first draft of the code
stipulates, the winner must be deter-
mined.

Three Honorary
Degrees Awarded

Commencement Speaker Stresses
Value Of University

At the semi-annual Commencement
exercises in Memorial hall Friday,
188 degrees in course were conferred
on students in the graduate and un-
dergraduate schocls of the Univer-
sity. In addition three honorary de-
grees were awarded.

Dr. Lynn Harold Hough, dean of
the Theological seminary of Drew
university, and principal Commence-
ment speaker‘, received the doctor of
laws degree; John Bell, organist of
the First Presbyterian church, and
Marshall Bidwell, organist at Carne-
gie Music hall, and director of music
at the Third Presbyterian church,
were awarded doctor of music de-
grees.

Ten ,s,ti1d.ent_s_receiv.,ed cum laude or
magna. cum lands on their diplomas.
These were: Richard Finlay Gregg-
and William Edward Workmaster,
Business Administration, honor; Mor-
ris Hoffman, College, high honor;
Raymond Pearlman;-* -College, honor ;*-‘A
Jane Kline and Bessie Kratzer, Edu-
cation, bachelor of arts, honor; Helen
Stephens, high honor; Lola lb.
Smith and Alberta M. Trimble, bach-
elor of science, honor.

Citing the University as a medium .

for interpreting the ages to the age,
Dr. Hough asserted that a Univer-
sity’s ,_b_,est service could be rendered
as a coordinator of the niodern"man
and his equipment. He warned of the
persistent danger of the man who
masters things and forces, yet fails of
discipline in the subtler uses of the
mind, and held the University to be
not only the distributor of technical
knowledge, but also the importer of
human experience of the past.

Dr. Hough likened people to two
trees: the Christmas tree which is
beautiful and splendid only because
of the addition of ornaments and
lights to it, and the apple tree which
is beautifiil through its own produc-
tion, and asked the graduates to de-
termine for themselves to what class-
iﬁcation they belonged. It was in the
control of these two diverse types
that Dr. Hough sees the most nota-
ble services for a University, that of
“marking off of the areas within
which it is safe to experiment, and
the setting forth of the permanent
sanctions which hold in their power
the welfare of the individual and the
race.” » - —

After i.1'ampi11g around in the rain
for half an hour trying to find the
stage door of the Alvin. I followed

three-foot puddle into a. back door,
gave the stage door man a cigarette
and ﬁnally succeeded in being admit-

di1'ecto.'.‘ of Cap and Gown.

Backstage amid 16 beaut‘?.fu1 cho-
rines was demure Miss Miller, 112
pounds of swell eyeful, coaching the
girls in high kicks. Dodging the girls’
wel1—turned ‘ankles, which were aimed
at my head, I got close enough to
Miss Miller to conclude that, on Feb-
ruary 25, the date set for the first Cap
and Gown tr_v—outs, the “Y” Hut will
be swamped with applicants for the
show.

Miss Miller, who was formerly
coach of chorus work at the Enright
and Stanley theaters, has also staged
revues at the Ambassador Club in St.
Louis and at a prominent night-club
in Milwaukee.

She will work in conjunction with
Theodore Vieliman, new director of
Cap and Gowii, in direct:in<=‘ the show.
Mr. Viehman, however, will have to
leave on Ma1'c.h 25 for Harvard,
where he will supervise the
staging of the Harvard “Hasty Pud-
ding" revue. Mr. Viehman is now
at Cambridge directing the initial
stages of “Hasty Pudding.” He will

' Usually, by the time the informal

the bargain angle appeals.

Selection of an orchestra is ex-

Hovey Analyzes’
Department Film

Fine Arts Head Links ‘Picture
. With Development In Art

 

Ruth Miller

«By Sydney Horovitz _

“Surrealism is a kind of hypnotism
of objects arranged without regard
for the unities of time, and space, but
with a sense of recording life as a
uniﬁed whole, gruesomely grotesque
as well as inspiringly beautiful.”

This explanation was advanced by
Walter ‘H. I-Iovey, acting head of, the
departnient of ﬁne arts, ‘in comment-
ing on “Le Chien Andalou,” famous
example of surrealist thought and one
of the ﬁlms to be screened by the
department on Tuesday evening, Feb-
ruary 26, in the large ball of the sixth
ﬂoor of the Cathedral. Students will
be invited to attend the-showing free.

“Surrealism,” Mr. Hovey said, “ap-
plies in a general way to the picture
because of its extreme portrayal of
horror. It is like a nightmare sug-
gested by the title, which translated
means ‘the werewolf.’ It shows the
impressionistic emphasis on com-
municating vitality without particular
regard ~ -for separated ’u»-nities.”

The other ﬁlm -on‘ the program,
“Poil de Carotte,” was selected, ac-
cording to Mr. Hovey, because of its
excellent photography.

Continuing his explanation of sur-
realisin, Mr. Hovey said, “this new
approach to the visual world begun.
in 1925, is an outgrowth of the de-
sire for the unusual and the bizarre.
These seemingly absurd attempts to
part from the representation of ac-
tuality have previously seemed child-
.i_._sh and undeveloped. But this new
school seems to be an end toward
which the others have striven.

“Based on the psychological devel-
opments derivative from Freud and
Jung, it recalls the Flemish painting
‘of the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth cen-
turies, as distinct from
.idealistic point of view of the class-
icists. Rather than an attempt to
beautify or glorify the world, it strives
to record life as a whole, thus being
-more vital -than mere decoration. The

All women’s colleges voted for the
League. All Catholic ‘colleges’ on. the

League.

In Pennsylvania, every major col.-
.lege which voted opposed the League.
These included Temple, University of
Pennsylvania, Penn State and Car-

The "Cotton South,” with few ex-

One college in Canada voted with

Queen’s university decided by an over-

Approximately 450 fraternity men,
in 13 chapter houses tonight, will
have an opportunity of voicing their
opinions on these questions.

CPSF heard tentative proposals for
an I-F constitution and for a new set
of rushing rules at its meeting Wed-
nesday night. Each house tonight will
go on record as to which sections of
each proposal it favors. At the next
meeting of (IPSF, February 26, def-

themselves to the University club

pianist, crooner and orchestra leader,
and the Swinging Aces, an all-colored
outﬁt who appear regularly at a local
“hot spot.” The orchestra is heard
regularly at midnight over WWSW.

Jennie’ appeared on the legitimate

Engineers’ Dance

W'ith the announcement that "The

circulated about the campus Thurs-
day. It was edited by Charles M.

The object of the edition was to an-
nounce the Engineers’ dance on March

jibes at the dances held by other

chairman of the dance, submitted a
list of ten local, orchestras for $1 a

$1.50 a couple. The engineers were
asked to select the band and price de-
sired.

that if we obtain a, national band the
price will be $1.50 a couple instead
of $1. Compare this with the work of

to shell out three peanuts or more to
get a national band.”

The I3-lace, the cost, the orchestra,
and the committee of the dance will
be announced later.

The Colleges Vote

ALTHOUGH the results of the

Literary Digest “peace poll”
among American colleges show
only rough approximations of
student opinion—-still less, stu-
dent conviction—t1iere are some
clear interpretations to be laid on
the balloting that included 118
colleges and brought out 100,000
student votes.

Sentimen.t on United States en-
trance into the League, for exam-
ple, was almost exactly balanced.
Fifty-oiie per cent opposed;
forty-nine per cent favored. Yet
the fact that the League coin-
iuands such regard at a time when
there is no organized agitation in
favor of it is an interesting omen,
particularly at a time when the
superannuated Senate has block-
ed our entrance even into the in-
nocuous ‘World Court.

The League vote shows that
sectionalisni perpetuates itself on
the old lines still. In the Middle

In

tionalism is there nearly synony-
mous with economic security, The
Digest points out. ,

Other conclusions which The
Digest felt justiﬁed in drawing
follow:

“In general, those colleges
which have well established repu-
tations for liberal educational.
policies are the colleges in which
a majority of undergraduates
voted in favor of entry into the
League of Nations.

“All women ’s colleges voted in
favor of entryinto the League.
All the Catholic colleges on the
list opposed entry.”

In regard to participation in
war, students piled up some em-
phatic percentages. \Vhile 88 per
cent say they will shoulder arms
if the United States is invaded,
82 per. cent will stay at home if
the United States carries war to
another country. In answer to
the question, “Do you believe
that a national policy of an
American Navy and Air Force
second to none is a sound method
of insuring us against being
drawn into another great war?”
only the following colleges out of
118 voted “yes”: Alabama. Ar-
kansas, Auburn, Boston College,
Florida, Fordham, Georgia, Lou-
isiana State, Maryland, North
Carolina State, Nevada, Purdue,
St. Stanislaus, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Tennessee Tech, Tu-
lane, and the University of De-
troit.

which supported “An American

Of Cynics, ‘Real’ Living Comes Only From Action

that what little signs of progress the

Moreover, if the world will enjoy any sort of improvement during his life-

Allegheny Observatory Has World’s
Largest Group Of Astronomical Plates

By Melvin Rogow

Dr. Frank C. Jordan, present head
of Allegheny Observatory, announced
Friday that over 51,000 photographic
plates have been made at the Oh-
servatory since 1914. In that year, a
refractory photographic telescope was
set up at the Observatory by the Uni-
versit-r. . 

This telescope, which has taken
more astronomical pictures than any
other in the world, has‘ a lens
diameter of 3-0 inches and a focal dis-
tance of 46 feet. Although most of the
pictures taken were over-night ex-
posures, it was sometimes necessary
to train the telescope on‘ a star or
planet for several days before enough
light was imprizited upon the plate to
permit scientiﬁc study. This, .ac-
cording to Dr. Jordan, was because of
the distance of some of the heavenly
orbits. - ' "

“The refractory photographic
telescope will often record star
impressions which the naked eye
could never see,” Dr. Jordan said.

 

would be impossible without it."
Allegheny Observatory is also

Gqllilmed with _a small reﬂecting tele-
scope, which is outmoded and is no
longer used. The new 20:0.-inch re-
iiecting telescope which is beingmad-9
ready for Mt. Wilson Observatory in
California, marks the newest ad-

. vance in this ﬁeld. At one time Alle
gheny Observatory had the largestre-l

fleeting telescope in the world, with a
diameter only 36 inches. ‘Dr. Jordan
believes that it will be about two
years before the new telescope is
ready for use. “It will take at least
that long for the glass to cool slowly
and to be polished to its proper
smoothness,” he said. '

The University maintains

t.o November 30, inclusive. Dr. Jor-

Do theater owners tear into critics
who slam their movies?

“Certainly not.” declared Kas-
par Monahan. Then he qualiﬁes
it: “At least, not in Pittsburgh.”

“I used to work in Denver,"
MI‘. Monahan told the Pitt News.
“In no time I had every theater
advertiser out of the paper."

But Pittsburgh is diff.-o.-reiit. In
Pittsburgh the critic may speak his
mind. Ererything goes so long as he
is fair_

“Do they try to influence me?"
asks Mr. Monahan. He answers
himself: “Read. my column.”

Mr. Monalian has :1 good word for
the Clean-up-the Movies campaign. He
believed it did some good, “elevated
the standard of plays.” He said:

“I know I wouldn't wantl my
daughter. to see some oi? the
plays I've seen.”

He thought the Pennsylvania Cen-
sorship board lias little left to do
:\nVm0i‘e, that they cut ﬁlms a. bit
now and then “just to look busy.”

And speaking of salaries:

‘''Why shouldn't stars get $1,-
000 a day? Babe Ruth gets a high
salary. Arthur Brisbane gets a
high salary. If -the public wants
the stars. lei: them pay for them.”
Mr. Monahan thought the best

plays he saw the last 1:3 months
were:

Our Daily Bread, The Wives of
Henry VIII, Of Human Bondage, The
Count of Mont-'e Cristo and Vi-iva
Villa.

get a good job in China when I’m
through.”

, Mr. Yee, who was president of his
high school class, wasn't sure
whether he’d prefer working for the
Chinese government or a private firm.
‘‘It’s a toss-up either way.”

But there is just one thing about
Pitt that Mr. Yee would like changed:

“Wouldn't it be great.” he de-
clares, “if they'd move those labs
down to the Catheclral?”

(Track Marks Go Boom

in Annual

Indoor Meet

Break 16 Old Records in Saturday Carnival;
Good Leads Scorers With 17 Points

 

By Harry E. Robinson
Wanted: a sign-painter to do a. little work up at the Pitt track

house.

That is the call University track authorities are sending out

as a result of the wholesale record-smashing efforts of Panther track-

men in Saturday’s indoor meet.

No less than 16 old ﬁgures will

have to be scraped off the wall following the third annual track and

ﬁeld championships.
Kenny \Vagenhouser opened

breaking the two-mile record previ-9

ously held by Gus Moore. Arvil Flem-
ing followed suit in the 50-yard dash
and low hurdles, Andy Lasky kept the
:4_trea-in’<of new marks ﬂowing by tak-
ing the 50-yard high hurdles, Captain
Fred Kiger broke both of: Bill Keller’s
old marks for the two-lap and quarter-
mile dashes, and Hal (lonnelly erased
Watkin’s old mark for the 880-yard
run.

In the ﬁeld events, Pelucha broke
his own track house record in the
pole vault with a jump of 12 feet, 9
inches, Bonavita pushed the shot out
to a new distance, and Vvalter Good
completed the varsity rout of old
znarks by setting a new hop, step, and
jump record. Good was, incidentally,
l1igh—Sco1'er of the meet with 17
points.

A versatile gentleman by the name
of Irvin Brown dominated the group
of freshman record-breakers. Brown
broke frosh records in the 50-yard
sprint and in both hurdle races.‘ Pete
Bennett set a new high jump mark
for both freshmen and varsity, Tony
E\I_atisi threw the 12-pound shot for a
new distance, and Jack McConnell
.~:._nrinted to a new yearling mark in
the 440-yard dash.

Cats Beat Irish
In ‘Long Game’

Emrick Gives Panthers Lead
After Timers Fix Watch

 

In a game faintly reminiscent of the
Dempse,v-Tunney “long-count” boxing
affair, the Panther cagers hung an-
other one on the chins of the Notre
Dame Irish by a 27-25 score. The
game ran from 10 to 15 minutes longer
than regulation time because some-
body forgot to wind the stop watch.

When the timers ﬁnally got adjusted
there wereﬁve minutes oﬂicially re-
maining in the game and Ross Em-
rick’s field goal had left the Cats be-
hind at 19-22. Emrick then droppedin
two niore -two-pointers in rapid suc-
cessior. and Pitt was ahead, 23-2'-.

Cribbs, who was the head-man of
the Panthers all evening, added a ﬁeld
goal as did his teammate Frank
Loucks, while Marty Peters was try-
ing to bring victory for the Irish with
a field goal and a foul. This left the
Cats with a two-point advantage when
the thing was ﬁnally over.

Emrick’s spurt at the ﬁnish gave
him 4. total of four baskets for the
eveuingand a tie with George Ireland,
Irish guard, for scoring honors with
eight points apiece. Cribbs and Peters
followed with seven points each.

Notre Dame started off to a ﬁve-
point spurt before the Panthers could
score a point in the ﬁrst half and they
matched each Pitt basket thereafter
to sport a 12-7 lead as the half ended.
They held the lead from that time 1111-
til Emrickwent on his scoring spree.

Just when:Emrick started the spree
is still a problem. The timekeepers’
watch stopped after 12%; minutes of
the second half had been played and
they did not look at the watch until
some 10 or 15 minutes later. There
was nothing to do but start it going
again and allow the. game to run until
the watch had ticked off the ofiicial
2.0 minutes of the half. _ -

Manhattan, 56-I5

Panthers Limit Jasper Tankmen
To Single First In Events

 

 

The Panther swimming t.eam’s 56 to
15 victory over Manhattan _Friday
night was doubly sweet to the Pan-
thers inasmuch as an announcement
of a recount of points in the Franklin
and Marshall meet gave the Pitt team
a 36 to 35 point victory, assuring the
Panthers of a tie, if not an undisputed
claim, to the Eastern Collegiate swim-
ming association championship, The
Panthers have not lost a meet to any
league opponent.

The Jaspers were thoroughly out-
classed by the Pitt team. Murray,
captain of the New York team, was
the only man capable of turning in _a
first place. He won the«200-yard
breaststroke race.

Coach Corr was well pleased with
the victory, but the performances of
sophomores Myers, Geyer, McQuillan,
and Stiranka, and juniors Lindberg
and Ruhe were the cause for more
pleasure. Myers and Mc-Quillan placed
ﬁrst and second in the dive. Geyer was
yards ahead of the Manhattan swim-
mers-in the 100-yard freestyle race,
and Stiranka was nosed out of a sec-
ond place in the breaststroke. Ruhe
won the 50-yard dash and Lindberg
won the 220-yard freestyle, and took
second in the backstroke race.

Captain Denny was high scorer
with 12 points.

‘Should You Marry On $30
A Week?’ ‘No!’—Say Students

10 Campus Leaders Oppose Early Marriages As Coeds

Prepare For “N uptial”

Debate With Penn State

 

“Should a college graduate, earning
a. maximum salary of $1,500 a year,
marry before the age of 25?" Two
University coeds will debate that
question on March 28 with two men
debaters from Penn State.

James Townsend of Penn State and
Marguerite Swank, C35. will u1)1101€l
the affirniative. Roy VVilkinson,
Penn State, and .VIarcella Leyton,
C37, will support the negative.

A letter which Miss Swank receiv-
ed from Townsend and Vtdlkinson
says: “Since we are going to debate

with two girls from Pitt with whomé

we have not only never talked, but

-whom we have never seen, we feel

that we ought at least to have some
commtliication with t.hem, especial-
ly since the debate is on such a
touchy question as marriage.”

The Pitt News, in quizzing a num- 5

her of prominent students about the
question,
lowing statements:

“It would be tough on the girl,”
said Charles Ruch. And in partial
agreement says Sally Sanderson:
“Yes, absolutely, but he's old enough
to know better. But if he chooses a
nice, economical wife, he’s probably
safe. That is, if he can ﬁnd one.”

A number of students believe that
"it cant be done.” “I could, but I
wouldn’t,"’ was the emphatic reply of

gR1lSS Connolly, Louise Mc§‘Iil'(l_V was
|even more deﬁnite when she said:
£“No, I don't think anyone should get

lmarried on less than $150 a month.”-

"It can be done," mused Louise
ELoughner, “l';ut I don't think it should
;be. It takes more than that for de-
fcent. cloizlies and :1 decent place to
;live." So agreed number of men
 students.

“Yes. but I wouldn‘t," was Charles
§Herald's viewpoint; and Ellis Turnp-
'eon zigreed that a fellow might, “but
ihe shouldn't.”

“It all depends on the man and the

3Don Canipbell; and Frances Mc-

iunless the girl has more than looks.”
' Ellsworth Miller thought that he
would be able to do it “in a parlor,
bedroom and sink;” but Muriel Dils
has other ideas. “I want a million-
aire when I get married,” she admit-
ted.

Joe Rodgei‘s thinks “it all depends

on whom I marry;” and Maxine
Hirsh philosophized, “I could with the
right kind of a man, but he doesn't
exist.”
Charles Foreman said that it would
be very difficult, “but I might."

wouldn't exactly recommend getting
married on it. I want somebody who
can buy enough books to keep me

actual point of view all mixed up, yet

“The surrealistic ﬁeld of painting

According to Mr. Hovey, Salvador
Dali, the director of “Le Ch_ien An-
dalou,” is the most active exponent
of surrealist thought. Besides; his
painting, “Enigmatic Elements in a
