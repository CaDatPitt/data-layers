Students protest law-school
ban on military recruiters

By Christine Hanna
Stajf Writer

Concerned Students for Equal
Access is protesting the Pitt law
school’s policy of banning military
recruiters from entering law-
school facilities.

The law school currently does
not allow military recruiters to
recruit in the law-school building
because the military’s policy of
banning homosexuals is in
conflict with Pitt’s non-
discrimination policy.

According to CSEA member
‘Paul Amato, since the military’s
policy is legal, the law school
should not consider it tolbe
discrimination.

“We feel that this is the decision
that the individual should make,”
Amato said. CSEA has started a

letter-writing crusade to get the
new policy changed. They have
distributed ﬂyers in the mailboxes
of other law students.

Flyers that CSEA is passing out
to students state, “Every firm has
clients or practices that offend
someone. Will _firms someday
have to pass a political screening
before they can interview here?”

The law school’s policy was

created during the 1991 spring '

term, when a coalition of law
students went to the Student Bar
Association, the elected law-
school representatives, asserting
that the military’s policy of not
hiring homosexuals conflicted
with the school’s anti-
discrimination code. The
association then voted to ban‘
recruiters from interviewing on
law—school facilities.

Though recruiters are not

allowed in the law building, they‘

can conduct interviews at other
campus facilities or off campus,
according to Mark Nordenberg,
dean of the law school.

N ordenbe rg said the law school
will continue to cooperate with
the military. The Placement Office
will help with military placing

-and on—campus interviews, but

beforehand students are given
information on homosexuality
and the military. I
Nordenberg also said military
recruiters have been pleased with
the Placement Office in making
the interview arrangements. There
have been no complaints to his
knowledge, he said. _
Amato said the rule poses an
inconvenience for law students

Oakland’s fire—fighting forces

By David T. Welch ‘ ' '
Asst. News Editor

Half of the fire protection in Oakland
shouldbe eliminated, according to a recent
study requested by the mayor's office.

The study, which was conducted by
Ernst and Young Consulting Firm at a cost
of $178,000, concluded that eight fire
houses could be closed without hindering
fire protection in the city.

The two fire houses protecting Pitt’s
campus which "could be closed are Local

11 on Baum Boulevard and Local 10 on

Allequippa Street. The fire truck in House
5 in the Hill District would also be put out
of service.
Fire fighters from those squads attended
a public meeting at Friendship Church last
night to oppose the recommendations.
Richard Greene, a fire fighter at House

5, said that eliminating trucknumber ﬁve
would cripple the protection of Oakland
and Pitt campus.

“We have two trucks and they are trying

‘to take one of them out. Another truck,

number 32, would come from the North
Side, but there is too much traffic. It would
take too much time [to answer. an
emergency calll,” Greene said.
Twelve-year veteran of House 10 Brian
Moffit agreed. “Number 14 engine and
number five engine are always the first to
respond. If they take away number five
and there is a fire in Oakland when
[number 14] is on call, who’s going to

’ cover it?” Moffit said.

Lew Borman, press secretary to Mayor
Sophie Masloff, explained the study. ‘-‘There
are a lot ofrumors of different fire stations
being closed as a result of the survey. The

BPC continues negotiations
oz/er retirement documents

_ By Renee Crespy

Asst. News Editor

The University Senate’s budget—policies
committee has yet to reach an agreement
with Pitt General Counsel Lewis Popper
about accessto documents on former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s retirement
package.

According to Philip Wion, president of
United- Faculty and member of the BPC,
the committee wants to see the documents
to assure that in the future “people making
the decisions will be more responsible.”

Popper has offered the BPC access to
the package with the understanding that it
will not reveal or make copies of the
documents.

But Wion said having access to the

‘documents without being able to reveal

the contents is pointless.

“We would like to see them, but not
under the restraint ofnot saying anything.
What’s the point? We would prefer not to
see the documents if we can’t reveal
anything about them,” Wion said, adding
that the committee’s “judgement should
be trusted in advance.”

According to Wion, if access to these
documents would have been made
available before Posvar’s retirement
package was decided on, “a better
judgement would have been made.”

“Perhaps Marous would have made
better judgements. They"weren’t thinking
of their decisions in terms of how it would
affect the faculty and staff, and these
decisions were made when funds were
scarce. It's no wonder everyone’s upset,”
Wion said.

BPC chairperson Edward Symons Said

Exhibit depicts life in Nazi Germany

By Megan Bertino
Asst. News Editor

Artist Gene Fellner’s series “And
There Was a Train Full of
Children” portrays the Holocaust
from the viewpoint of a child
who escaped Nazi Germany.

Fellner’s exhibit of 20 pastels
and nine constructions ‘depicts
his mother’s life in Germany from
the time shortly before Hitler came
to power until Nazi death camps
were established. It is currently
on display in the Frick Fine Arts
Building.

The inspiration for Fellner’s
works came from ‘taped
interviews Fellner had with his
mother Anita, who escaped Nazi
Germany and ﬂed alone to
England when she was 13 years
old.

According to Fellner, he did
not begin talking to his mother
with an art exhibit in mind, but as
a painter, his artwork seemed‘ to
be the natural outlet for the
emotions their conversations had

:'\Jinspired.

Each work's title is derived
from a quote Fellner took from
the tapes.

Recruit

The exhibit is numbered, and-

the works begin with pictures

' depicting Anita’s home life such

as, “My father never went out
without a carnation in his
buttonhole,” and moves to
themes more directly related to
the Holocaust with such
works as, “They rounded up all
the men and took them to
Dachau.”

Fellner‘ said he used distorted
figures and bright reds and pinks,
as well as the heavy use of black,
to express the passion he felt
about his mother’s life.

The strong energy of the works
should not be confused with
anger, he said. “I wasn’t angry at
all. Part of it was empathizing
[with my mother] at the time.”

Despite the dark nature of the
story behind the exhibit, creating
the pastels and constructions was
“an incredibly uplifting
experience” for Fellner. “Yes, it
was difficult to do. I worked on it
through tears,” he said.

The constructions, made of
paper and cloth on wooden bases,
bring Anita’s story to life in a
three—dimensional depiction of
Nazi Germany.

Each construction ' is
accompanied by a a small excerpt
from the interviews.

The first construction describes
the feeling of pre—Nazi Germany
through the eyes of a child with
the inscription, “In the plebiscite
of 35 they handed out hundreds
and hundreds of little pins which
it said ‘Ja,’ which meant vote
‘Yes,’ for Hitler  I remember
being uneasy. You would walk
along the street, and somewhere
there would be painted a big
hackenkreuz, a swastika. And
there was never a time we didn’t
know it was dangerous, never.
We drank it in our mother’s milk

The construction for which the
exhibit is named, “And there was
a train full of children,” depicts

’ Anita’s escape from Germany.

Anita’s parents had found a
family to sponsor her in England
where she would live in a girl’s
hostel.

Anita’s father took her to the
train station. Once the train pulled
away, she never saw her family
again. Her parents and her
brother were killed in Nazi death
camps.

SGB supports O’Connor
induction despite cost

By Cristine McCauley
For T be Pm News

The Student Government Board strongly supports an induction
ceremony for Pitt President _I. Dennis O’Connor.

“There have been a lot of rumors that the induction
ceremony should take place with another ceremony to save
money. I think people are skeptical to have an induction
ceremony because it would be costly to do so,” SGB President
Brent Saunders said at last night’s SGB meeting.

“I feel we need to set priorities. He deserves a welcome.
There should be no delay. It is an insult that the university
community thinks he should not have one,” Saunders said.

Although there have been several welcoming receptions for
O’Connor, the receptions h_ave been limited to a small pool of
people, according to SGB member Gil Golden.

“It would be a service to the public as well as to him. Dr.
O’Connor deserves an induction ceremony. Maybe he doesn't
deserve thousands of dollars in an office, but he deserves a
ceremony,” Golden said.

In other business:

-The SGB has announced that O’Connor is interested in
having students choose the commencement speaker at
graduation. Anyone with suggestions for a speaker should
contact Saunders this week. -

-There will be a meeting with an alumni organization to
discuss purchasing new equipment for the Trees Hall weight
room. The athletic department will contribute $5,000 for new
equipment, Golden said.

“It definitely puts one more hurdle in
the path of one who wants to interview
with the military,” he said.

But Christine Biancheria, a member of
the law school’s Gay Rights Organization,
said that if the military was allowed to

recruit, it would open the doors for other
discriminatory organizations.

“The minute that a military recruiter
comes through the door of a law
school, many students are denied equal
access to employment opportunities,”
Biancheria said. ,

Amato said that CSEA is not debating the
merits of gay rights

“We're not opposed to any minority

group,” Amato said.

The military’s ban on homosexuals has
also come into question regarding the
campus ROTC chapter. A University Senate
committee recently recommended that
Pitt should ban the ROTC from campus if
the military does not change its policy by
1997. ‘

 

 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

According to Cadet Morgan Marietta,
Army ROTC public-relations officer, the
law school’s new policy'“is ludicrous.”

“The anti—discrimination policy has noth-

ing to do with who can and cannot re-cruit‘

here,” Marietta said. “To say that any
organization cannot walk into a public
university to talk with a student is anti-
American.” '

Senate conduct abhorrent

By the skin of a 52-48 margin Clarence Thomas became
a Supreme Court justice. Despite the allegations of sexual

_‘ harassment and judicial inexperience, Thomas was
. successfully confirmed in a series of processes we can

describe as disheartening at best and repugnant at worst.
The partisan fracas of Thomas’ questioning was amusing

- compared to the shameful display that resulted from the

charges levied against Thomas by law Professor Anita Hill.

Rather than view her testimony and its ramifications on
t~heir_own merit, Republicans in both the Senate Judiciary
Committee and the ‘Senate viewed this in terms of the

‘ political damage at stake and drove their fangs into Anita

Hill like Dracula on his prey. .
' Leading this charge were Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania
and Orrin Hatch of Utah. Without conscience or

. consideration, Hatch tore into Hill and motivated completely

by partisan politics sunk so low as to foster some parallel

. between Hill’s testimony and the novel The Exorcist.

As the Republicans’ leader in the questioning, Specter,

too, offered brash .at_LaCkS, underthe guise...of:._a_ polite and _

calming demeanor. His ‘unbridled 'ske“p”tici“sm of Hill
culminated in his denunciation of her as being guilty of
periurr  

Specter, Hatch and others were also critical of Hill making
these charges now when the incidents occurred 10 years
ago. Being incapable of suffering this same type of
harassment, their ‘choice to attack rather than understand
makes their-motives of partisanship exponentially more
reprehensible.

Democrats were equally guilty of ﬂoundering through
the appointment process. Like their Republican counterparts,

’ toomany were caught up in the notion that this was a trial,

when in fact the entire process was an inquiry.

As well, Thomas’ emotional outbursts about his own
suffering during the questioning unnerved Democrats,
who refused to probe him on issues that needed to be

1... -; >»3.’.s’:4A'.-. ..

a   M,__, talk about':"*‘a'ff”assas§in’s bullet” being

more appealing than the Hill questioning kept the Democrats -

from pressing him about his unwillingness to reveal the
state of his marriage at the time of the alleged harassment,

‘his opinions on the types of pornography Hill said he so

vividly described to her and how all this relates to the
fundamental right of privacy. _ _

Senators did admit they felt the credibility of Anita Hill
was enhanced by her position as a law professor. Some
Republicans had the audacity to contend that because of

her respectable stature, her charges against this “moraland

upstanding” man must have developed from some
psychological imbalance. ‘ _
What many Republican members of the Senate have

V shown the women of America is that women’s rights and

discrimination issues are important for votes until they

' cause a stumbling block in the .furthef"ring of the GOP ”

agenda.

Women have paid the price for George Bush to have his
legacy carry on in the Supreme Court. They are left withthe
graphic image of Anita Hill's brutal treatment when she
brought sexual—harassment charges against a man with

. powerful friends.

as you and me, and they have
bills just like we do. After all, it
costs a lot of money to get yourself
elected so you can enjoy

of minds. First a bunch of them _ ,
gotiilh trouble with the S&L Scandal. (Wliich, by the
way, stands for Silliness and Lunacy. But that's a
different story.) Now we, the voters, find out that
some members of Congress have been bouncing
more checks than a rubber factory.

So the major question arises: What the heck is
going on, and howcan we, the voters, get in on it?
Ordinarily, I wouldn’t write a ‘column like this,’ but
this check-bouncing scandal has caused such a
brouhaha that I have no choice but to answer some
burning questions that must_ be on somebody’s
mind.

What the hecle is going on with our members of
Congress? A

Good question. You see, our national legislators
have to enjoy special privileges in return for serving
their country’s good and being forced to listen to
Vice President Quayle with a straight face. So things
like the House Bank were set up to make it easier
for representatives to do their banking and write
checks.

The catch is, if the checks were bad, they didn’t
bounce. They ﬂoated. This means that the House
Bank wouldn’t return checks. It would just hold
onto them (all 8,331 between 1989 and 1990) until
they could be paid.

There were8,33I checles./? That’s a lot! How many
chccles is that per representative?

That’s 19 rubber checks per representative in one
year. So, now you see the big scandal that came out
of this.

That ’s a lot of bad checles.

Well, yeah, but just remember that members of
Congress are human, just like you and me. I’m sure
they had a lot of important things to pay off and

privileges like free mail and
unbounceable checks,

Wait a second. Free mail? '

Sure. Didn’t you ever hear "of the .“franking
privilege”? It lets members of Congress send all
those annoying mailings that look like pizza coupons
so you can save money at your favorite local
pizzeria. . . ' '

Actually, no. I didn ’t hear of that. Gee, you learn
something new every day, don ’t you?

Hey, that’s what I'm here for. But free mail is a
different story. Anyway, getting back to the check-
bouncing scandal — -

Have you ever bounced a check?

That’s none of your business. Anyway, from what
I hear, one of the proposed solutions to this whole
thing is for the House Bank to give low—interest

loans to cover the checks until the House members

can pay them back.
‘ Waitasecond. Low-interest loans? Who ’sgoing to
pay for that?

Oh, I wouldn’t worry. about it. Congress will.

probably cover the loans. After all, look at all the
money they save in postage every year. I doubt it
will fall into the hands of the people.
Well, this sounds li/ee a pretty sweet deal . How can
we, the voters, get in on this?
That’s pretty tough, actually. See, most credit

.unions aren’t as nice to their members as the House
v Bank. I’ll bet your only way to get a deal like that

is to get elected to Congress. Of course, you’ll
probably rack up quite a tab in your campaign
costs, but don’t worry.

. I'm sure the House Bank will take good care of

you once you get there.

Pittfs basketball squad has had

Now, instead of knowing that

head coach Paul Evans has plenty

to be surgically removed.

Jones started seven games last
year and scored in Pitt's last nine

points and two rebounds a game

after playing sparingly in the early ’

portion of the schedule. “He
would have given us some more
leadership,” said Evans. “And he
had a great summer.”

With Jones on the sidelines,
the small forward position is open,
and there are several candidates.
Sophomore Gandhi Jordan and
new recruit Orlando Antigua can
both play that position, but Evans
is taking a wait-and—see stance
on determining a starter.

“It’s a shame that [I can get

‘playing time] because‘ of the

injury,” said Antigua, “because I
could have experienced a lot
playing against Uonesl in practice.
But I’m going to try to step up
and do the best I can.” '
After losing four senior starters,
the offense will be looking to
Miller to give itja boost. “Ithink

the team will be looking forme to

score in double figures, like '13 to
15 points a game.”
For his career,Miller has

averaged just under 10 points a .

game.

But don’t expect offensive
ﬁreworks from the senior from
Beaver Falls. “In our

’offense,you’re not going to see a

lot more scoring ‘from the point
guard.”

r So where will the points come
from? Evans is counting on junior
forward Chris McNea1, who
appears to be the person to beat
for the power-forward spot.

In the backcourt, sophomores

"Ahmad Shareef and Tim Glover

will figure in the picture.
Shareef "provided some
memorable highlights with his
athleticism last year, while
Glover’s name became a

household word during the NCAA A

Tournament, where his 12 points

Panthers into the second round.
Evans is also thinking about
altering the offense somewhat,
creating more opportunities for
the fast break. “We’re going to
still run our power game,” he
said, “but maybe do something
different that would let us get
away with smaller forwards.”
The Panthers do have quick
forwards, but the key to
establishing the transition game
lies with the team's center.
Morningstar returns after
improving a yearago, but the

- focus in the pivot is on 6-foot-ll

inch, 24S—pound Eric Mobley.
Mobley has not played in almost
two years since transferring from
Allegany Community College in
Maryland. “He’s the biggest
question,” said Evans.

If Mobley can provide a shot-
blocking presence in the middle,
then Pitt might be able to run
more effective1y.4‘.We have the
horses,” said Antigua. “We’re not

big and strong, but we are very.

athletic and very quick.”

The preseason schedule should
provide Evans with answers to
many of these questions.

~ Pitt plays two exhibition games
before facing Manhattan.Co1lege
in the first round of the preseason

National Invitational Tournament. '

Possible tournament foes
include I Kentucky and Georgia
Tech. If Pitt beats Manhattan, it
faces the winner of the Kentucky-
West Virginia game, which means
that the Panthers could play the
Wildcats in Lexington.

Then the Panthers face North
Carolina State in the Big East-
ACC Challenge. “The preseason
schedule is not exactly what we’d
like for this young/group,” said
Evans.

But it will provide some

Women’s basketballtackles rebuilding tas‘k‘Without stars

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

It's too bad that the Pitt Lady Panthers

" could not get another year of eligibility for

forward Lorri Johnson. Without her they
have some big shoes to fill.

Unlike last year, the Lady Panthers could
not get Johnson reinstated to play this
season. Johnson was among the league
leaders in every category except steals,
three—point percentage andblocked shots
last season. She was granted another year
by the NCAA after appealing because she
had to sit out a year with an injured knee
earlier in her career. The NCAA claimed
that she did not qualify for a redshirt
because of academics. When Johnson
later appealed, she was allowed to return
for a fourth season.

Also gone this year is center Connie
Hurt. Hurt finished second in the league in
blocked shots with S4, and averaged over

11 points and five rebounds a game for_

Pitt.

Trying to. improve on last season’s 16-1'3: ' A’,

record (10-6 in the Big East), the Lady
Panthers are a different type of team than
they were before.

“This year we're going to have to rely on
our speed and our defense,” said head
coach Kirk Bruce. “You’re not going to
find too many players like Lorri that will
come in and give you everything that she
has. We can’t try _to be the same type of
team that we were without Lorri.”

Pitt also lost Shannon Davis, a big-time
player from nearby Sacred Heart High
School. Davis originally signed with
Virginia

but transferred when they wanted her to
go to a prep school to improve her grades.
After transferring to Pitt, Davis was forced
to sit outrnuch of last season in order to
get her grades up. However, she withdrew
from school in the spring of last year.

The Lady Panthers return one starter
from last year’s frontcourt in sophomore
forwardJonna H_uernrich. Huemrich started
in all 29 games as a first-year student a year

‘ago. . v
She :rea11ybegan'__to play well in the Big '

.,_5.'

East season, finishing in the top 10 in both
rebounding and blocked shots in league
play. Huemrich averaged 10 points and

six rebounds a game for the Lady Panthers. ,

“I think thatJonna has all the ability that
Lorri had,” said Bmce. “She only knows
one way of doing things, and that's to
work for them. She's as hard a worker as
I think I’ve seen."

Injuries to key players also hurt the Lady

‘Panthers last year. Junior guard Jill‘

McElhinny, who started every game of her
first season, was sidelined for much of last

year with a stress fracture. McElhinny’s,

backcourt partner, Maureen McConnell,
who also started in every game as a first-
year student, also missed a part of last year
with a foot injury.

“I wouldn't say that they are 100—percent
back, but they are a lot better than they
were at this time last year,” Bruce said.
“We’re .trying to bring them back slowly:
We don’t want to rush anything.”

The Lady Panthers have several other
players returning who received
considerable playing time last season.

Sophomore guards Jenine Joyce, Jill
Colabrese and Erin Maloy and center
Carolyn Miller are all expected to see large
amounts of action this year, as are junior
guard Lisa Fessler and junior forward
Tiffany Fingers. ‘
Returning to the Pitt lineup again this
year is junior forward Turia Ransom. After

being named to the all-rookie squad in her '

first season, Ransom had to sit out 21
games. last year because of academic

1 problems. ,

However, she has returned this season
and gives the Lady Panthers some needed
height in the frontcourt.

“Turia and Jonna have a lot of the same
qualities,” said Bruce. “They botl1 rely on
their quickness, speed and poise to make
plays. I think that she has gotten her
problems behind her and shevcan come in
and really contribute.” ’

The Lady Panthers also picked up two .

recruits this year. Forward Julie Fornadel
of Hickory High School in Hermitage, Pa.,

‘will join the Pitt frontcourt this year. She

Replacingkejl losses crucial to wo

By Brian Gallagher

If you ask typical head coaches
about what they expect from their
first—year athletes, you’re likely to
get responses like, “we’re easing
them into the program,” or,
“they’re getting their feet wet,”
Women's swimming head coach
David Belowich is not a typical
head coach.

In 10 years as the women’s
swimming coach he’s guided the
Panthers to 10 straight Big East
championships.

Losing what he calls a
tremendous class” of six
swimmers and divers to
graduation, Belowich was pressed
to recruit a new class of swimmers
and divers with the ability to
sustain Pitt’s Big East dominance.

About the swimming and diving

U

class of 1995, Belowich offered
two observations: “After I
recruited this class, I thought that
by the time they're seniors, they
could potentially be better than
the class we just graduated.”

After seeing the first—year
athletes perform and work with
the full squad, he amended his
opinion. “After seeing them
practice together with the team,
I'm convinced they will [be better
than the class of 1991],” Belowich
said.

The class of 1995 consists of
four swimmers. Vicki Geubtner
is a freestyle sprinter from William
Tennent High School near
Philadelphia. Keri Killinger, from
nearby Gateway High School,
will participate as a middle-
distance freestyler. Swimming in
the backstroke and butterﬂy will
be Christy Knobloch, a graduate

of Chamberlain High School in
T ampa‘, Fla. Laura Zdyb from
Acton-Boxboro High School near
Boston, will swim in the individual
medley.

Entering his 13th year at Pitt,
diving Coach Julian Krug
welcomes three new divers: Kara
Sixbury, from Williamsville High
School near Buffalo; Coraopolis
native and Moon High School
graduate Anne Marie ‘Rose; and
Donna Ziegler, from Blue
Mountain High School in
Orwigsburg, Pa. Ziegler is the
younger sister of former swimmer
Terri Ziegler.

The accomplishments of
women’s swimming over the past
decade under Belowich are
impressive when you consider
that he recruits against powers
like Florida State and new Big
East foe Miami. Both schools offer
prospective swimmers and divers
larger scholarships and better

  

climates.

Often Belowich finds himself
limited in what he can offer to
recruits. He recalled the recruiting
season in which his second-year
assistant Chris Choromanskis was
a senior in high school and
looking at colleges.

“She came back to me in May,
which is quite late for seniors,
and said she was interested in
coming to Pitt,” he said. “But I’d
already distributed the
scholarships allotted to me and
had nothing to offer her, so she
went to Miami [of Ohio].”

Despite that recruiting loss,
Belowich is wary of signing
athletes before they complete
their senior season. He’s seen too
many things happen with early
signings and knows he cannot
afford to waste a scholarship on
someone with great potential but
questionable character.

In fact, Belowich relies on

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, October 16, 1991

men’s swimming

feedback from his returning
swimmers to determine whether
possible recruits will mesh with
the team.

“If there’s someone I’m
recruiting that the team has a
problem with, I'll take it into
account,” he said. A

One problem the team has to
deal with is the new 20-hours-
per—week practice limit that the
NCAA enforced for the 1991-92
athletic year. Belowich insists that
swimming and diving teams need
about 24 hours a week to stay in
top form. “The soft medium
[water] allows for longer workouts
because of less resistance,” he
said. “Therefore, to build strength
and endurance, more time is
needed.”

He’s doing all he can to budget
practice time wisely and hopes
that the loss of practice time does
not affect his team as the season
progresses.

contribute to our squad,” Bruce

said. “We only have 11 players,_

so we really need them to be a
part of our system.”

The Lady Panthers also have to
deal with the addition of another
opponent to the league schedule
this year.

Miami has been added to the
conference slate, and the Lady
Panthers will play that team twice.
The Hurricanes compiled a 20-10
overall record last year while
competing in the New South
Conference. They are led by

. senior guard Frances Savage, who

averaged 30 points and 10
rebounds a game last season.
“They are going to be very
tough,” said Bruce. “They will
have an immediate impact and
can finish in the top three without
any problem.”While the Lady
Panthers may lack a superstar
like Johnson, they make up for it
in speed, quickness and defense.
“This is what I like most about
coaching,” Bmce said. “Things
change every year, and you have
to make the adjustments. That’s
what makes it challenging.”

the faculty should be treated in a
more trusting fashion. “It’s time
that central administration starts
to act in an open and trusting
manner towards faculty,” he said.

Symons also said the BPC will
not review the documents under
Popper's terms.

“I'm not going to look at them
under his terms because if we
find something, we as a
committee can't do anything
under -his terms,” Symons said.

But Popper said an agreement ,
will soon be worked out.

“I suspect we’ll be able to
work out an agreement soon.
We’re conferring with the BPC.
We want them to review the
documents and share with the
central administration their-views

’ on how things might be done

differently. We’re looking

forward to having their views,”
Popper said.

But Popper expressed concern
over the “privacy and protection”
of Posvar’s documents.

The administration is concerned
about violating Posvar’s right to
privacy, Popper said.

“We don’t generally take an
employee’s file and hand it over
for anyone to look at. However,
we think that it’s important to
share with a key faculty committee
the documents that allow them to
form views and recommendations
on matters of management,”
Popper said, adding that he wants
the BPC to share in “the
governance of the university in
the area of budget and to do so
by discussing the matter with
the administrators that are
involved in making recommend-
ations.” I

study did propose that a number
of stations be closed. The fact
that it is recommended does not
mean it is going to happen.
“We are first and foremost
concerned with the safety of our
citizens, and we will not
compromise that right now. We
don't believe that there will be a
shortage [of fire protection],’’
Borman said.

disagreed. According to King,
elimination of truck number five

would mean that other trucks '

‘ would be too far away to respond
quickly.

“When you have high-rises, like
at Pitt, you need a larger number
of responses to calls. If they take
away any of these trucks, the
other responses will be coming
from Bloomfield or downtown.
Will the fire protection be
adequate? Absolutely not,” King
said. * _

If Houses 10 and 11 are closed,
the ﬁre fighters will be transferred
to other houses, according to

» Fireman’s Union Number One

spokesperson Don Dorsey. “The
guys will still have jobs, but*that’s
not the issue. People in Oakland
are paying for fire protection, but

.they’re not receiving it,”_Dorsey .

said. _

City Council member Jake
Milliones was at the meeting but
said that he could not yet make a
decision about the proposal. “I
have not made up my mind yet as
to howl feel about the proposal.
They are only recommendations
at this time,” Milliones said.

Milliones also suggested that a
meeting concerning the proposal
be held between him, Pittsburgh
Director of Public Safety Glen
Cannon and King.

Cannon could not be reached
for comment.
