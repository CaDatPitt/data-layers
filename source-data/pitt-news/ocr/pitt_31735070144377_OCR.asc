Traffic lights leave

commuters in dark

by Liz Navratil
Aaaz21tantNewd Editor‘

The traffic at Fifth _Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard was
worse than normal yesterday. eve-
ning when the stoplights stopped
working.

Joseph Vallerian, a spokesper-
son for Duquesne Light, said the
power company had a problem

. with an underground electrical

cable that affected the intersec-
tion and parts of North Oak-
land. A

Pitt police received the call that

the stoplights stopped working
at 4:38 p.m. and sent six officers
to the intersection to direct traf-
ﬁc, leaving the emergency lights
on their cars ﬂashing while they
worked. City police sent at least
two ofﬁcers to the intersection as
well. 0

The last Pitt police officer left
the intersection two and a half
hours later, at 7:04 p.m.

Pitt police said the -people
driving through the intersection
were generally understanding,
and there weren’t any accidents.

Student organizations host events, promote Gaza awareness

by Becky Reiser
Staﬁ’ Wrtrer

As the conflict in the Gaza
Strip continues, ‘Pitt students
ﬁnd themselves in an ideologi-
cal battle of their own.

Students supporting both
sides of the situation in the
Middle East are reacting by
planning and attending multiple
events on campus.

Pitt Students for Justice
in Palestine planned several
events to raise awareness of the
situation in Gaza and promote
peace. The group’s president,

Jonas Moffat, said approxi-

mately 10 student groups en_- _

dorsed and participated in four
events in four days. 0

The Kimbo Art Gallery in
the \X/illiam Pitt Union opened
a new exhibit Friday called
“Hope under Siege: A Palestine
Photo Exhibit.” Pitt Students
for Justice in_Palestine co-spon-
sored the event, along with the
Muslim Student Association
and other student groups.

0 Students also gathered in the
Union to listen to speeches and
poetry readings and eat Middle
Eastern food.

“I was overwhelmed Friday,”
said Moffat. “I went to the win-
dow [in the Union] to reserve
seats, and I reserved 100.”

Moffat, however, estimated
that there were more than 200
attendees in the Union.

“People , were ﬂooding

. the stairs and sitting on rail-

ings,” said Moffat. “There
was standing room only.”

The main focus of the event
was the photo exhibit, which
displayed pictures Moffat_ took
when, he travelled to Palestine
in 2003, 2006 and 2007.

“It was a different angle and

perspective,” said Sultan Ghu-
man, a member of the Muslim
Student Association Board. “I
thought it was interesting, be-
cause the exhibit was planned
out months before but coinci-

dentally has to do with what is

. happening now.”

On Saturday, people gathered
in Washington, D.C., in support
of National Call to Action Day.
One bus traveled from Pitts-
burgh, along with several buses
from neighboring cities, such as
Cleveland and Philadelphia.

“Usually the Iraq or Af-
ghanistan anti-war protesters
ﬁll buses to D.C., and Palestine
is on their periphery, but there
was a stand-by list of 25 to 30
people that couldn’t go,” said
Moffat. » ,

Women engineers compete against themselves

by Alie Gensheirner
Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt’s Society of Women En-
gineers won a national award for
excellence in its chapter.

The society, a professional or-

ganization dedicated to helping ‘

women thrive as engineers, won
the Outstanding Collegiate Sec-
tion Award at the silver level for
the 2007-08 academic year.

The award is the second high-
est given to a collegiate chapter
and is based on an organiza-
tion's’ success at meeting specif-
ic guidelines, said Dana Bruck,

the chapter's corporate relations
chair.

“Each chapter competes
against itself,” said Bruck. “Any
number of sections can earn
awards at all levels, depending
on their achievements.

“In order to be eligible for
the award, a chapter has to dem-
onstrate (the society’s) strategic

priorities through activities and ,

events. They are education, out-
reach, inclusiveness, diversity,

«knowledge source, leadership

and professional development."
In addition to meeting these
priorities, she said, a chapter

A PORTRAIT or PALESTINE

must complete and submit a’
packet that includes a self—eval-
uation, a report and documenta-
tion of the chapter's activities.
"Last year when I became
president of SWE, there were
all new officers’ and we decided
to totally re-vamp everything
and help the section grow," said
Bruck. "We wanted to make
it an organization that people
want to be a part of, and we feel
like we've been successful."
The report that was required as
part of the criteria for the award
highlighted the chapter's special

Free tickets questionable

\

In a story reminiscent of many
of Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s early
days in office, he and Allegheny
County Chief Executive Dan On-
orato said that they’ll both be sitting
in the Sports and Exhibition Au-
thority’s luxury box for the Steelers
playoff game this weekend. The
game_is fetching ticket prices of
more than $200 just for upper-deck
seats, but Onorato and Ravenstahl
will be attending for free

According to the Tribune-Re-
view, the SEA reserves the luxury

box for “economic development.

purposes.” Although Ravenstahl
refused to comment on the tick-
ets, Onorato said that at last week’s
game, he “talked to half a dozen
CEOS who do business in the
county.” He added, “My economic
development director  will wine
and dine companies here or show
them the area.”

This isn’t the first time that
Ravenstahl has run up against the
difference between private and
public duties. In 2007, he took an
SUV owned by the county and
purchased with federal Homeland
Security money to a Toby Keith
concert and later reimbursed the
county for $145.50 for its use, ac-
cording to the Pittsburgh Post-Ga-
zette.

He also ﬂew to Manhattan in
March 2007 for drinks with Ron
Burkle, the co-owner of the Pitts-
burgh Penguins, on Burkle’s private
jetmere hours after signing a deal
to build a new stadium to replace
Mellon Arena, a trip worth an es-
timated $1,400 later reimbursed by
Ravenstahl’s campaign donations,
the Post-Gazette reported.

And his much—publicized golf
outing with Mario Lernieux at the
latter’s celebnty invitational was
paid for by UPMC, something

for city officials

for which then—mayoral candidate‘

Mark DeSantis criticized him heav-

ily. UPMC spent approximately /

$27,000 for Ravenstahl and two ex-
ecutives to play in the tournament
at Laurel Valley Golf Club.
Admittedly, it is the job of the
SEA to publicize Pittsburgh and

_attract businesses, investors and

tourists to the area. But that goal
shouldn’t be accomplished by giv-
ing tickets to public officials so
they can participate in economic
development meetings that could
potentially affect the whole county.

If city officials want to “wine
and dine” CEOs and investors,
they certainly shouldn’t be doing
it on the tab of a private company
that owns and operates some of
the largest facilities and infrastruc-
ture projects in the city. And ac-
cepting tickets to a privately owned
sporm franchise, like the Steelers, is
the same as accepting any other gift
on behalf of _the city.

Ravenstahl has already tried to
pull a Marie Antoinette-style ex-
cuse with regard to some of his
earlier ethical dilemmas, 
he was ignorant of regulations or
county involvement or that he sim-
ply didn’t see any problem with his
actions. But surely he should have
learned by now. And if he hasn’t,

.then that might be indicative of a

problem with Ravenstahl's ethics in
general.

Both Ravenstahl and Onorato
should at the very least reimburse
SEA for the cost of the tickets
to the Steelers game, the same as
Ravenstahl has paid for his other
lapses in judgment And it goes
without saying that they shouldn’t
accept any more, unless they’re
paying ‘for them like every other
game attendee does.

by Giles Howard
Colum/212;! .

Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have,
for decades, functioned as the only
bastions of civil liberty and equality
in a state otherwise characterized by
biblically inspired bigotry and hate
_ For too long, members of the
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgen-
der community have faced legalized
discrimination outside of these two
urban centers
But civil rights in southwestern
Pennsylvania will no longer stop at
the Pittsburgh city limits if an Al-
legheny County anti-discrimination
ordinance is successﬁilly passed by
the county council.
The ordinance, proposed by
county Councilwoman Amanda
Green injuly of last year, would pro-

tect individuals from discrimination '

based on such factors as race, national
origin and color. More importantiy
and controversially, the ordinance

I would prohibit discrimination based

on a person’s “gender identity or ex-
pression [or] sexual orientation.”

The ordinance would also set up
a 16-member commission to inves-
tigate claims of discrimination that
would punish violations of the ordi-
nance.

In short, the ordinance would
members of the LGBT community

Ordinance protects LGBT rights

movements in the United States
Women and blacks have been 
the right to vote, and schools and
public facilities have been desegre-
gated. Now it’s time to protect the
LGBT community from employ-
ment and housing discrimination.

But just as hate mongers, religious
bigots and the ignorant came out of
the woodwork to oppose the rights
of women and blacks, opposition has
slowly formed against this ordinance

The American Family Associa-
tion of Pennsylvania, which desmibes
itself as “a Christian organization
promoting the biblical ethic of de-
cency in American society,” has been
especially vocal in denouncing the or-
dinance The Association has distrib-
uted e-mails that claim that the ordi-
nance would force schools, churches
and businesses to employ people who
engage in bestiality and incest

Organizations such as the Ameri-
can Family Association of Pennsyl-
vania are the spiritual descendents of
groups like the Ku Klux Klan, groups
that campaigned against desegrega-
tion and civil rights by telling white
people. that integration was a sexual
threat to white women.

We should remember that the
KKKwas a “good Christian” organi-
zation, that it claimed to be upholding
the biblical ethic every time it lynched
a black man or burned a cross

Such hate has no place in our
society, but as of Sunday the Post-

Gazette reported that Councilwoman
Green only has the “tentative support
of seven of her colleagues”

Eight council members are

nance be adopted, it is equally impor-
tant that it is approved by a significant
majority of council members. Ap-
proving the ordinance by a slight ma-
jority would send the wrong message
to the people of Pennsylvania, and it
would demonstrate that the voices of
intolerance still have a strong public
presence in southwestern Pennsylva-
nia.

We cannot afford to be branded as
a community that accepts all peoples
regardless of race, religion and sexual
orientation, but only just barely.

Southwestern Pennsylvania is al-
ready a center for progressive medi-
cine and higher education. Now the
area has an opportunity to serve as an
example of tolerance and decency to
the rest of this state

In pursuing such an ordinance, we
must remember that such protections
do not exist at the state level and that
people across this state do not enjoy
the protections that the citizens of
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh do. To
extend such rights throughout all of
Allegheny County is an important
step in  change in Harris-
burg and, hopefully, in Washington.

This ordinance is just one small
part of our modern civil rights strug-
gle to. extend the full privileges of
citizenship to gay Americans This
ordinance brings us one step closer to
full  rights for homosexuals
and the public repudiation of bigots

It is time to deny  a role in
public discourse and to elevate our
region above the hate, lies and fear
of those who are so insecure in their
own  as to deny them to others.

Squirrel Hill, with its old houses
and safe streets, is one of Pitts-
burgh’s most family—ftiendly neigh-
borhoods. But in the basement of
one such house lies a well-kept se-
cret. The kids call it — gasp! — rock
’n’ roll, and it comes in the form
of power—pop quartet Triggers.

Practicing on Monday night
in preparation for the band’s up-
coming  at the 31st Street Pub,

plans to rock the strip

2005, Kawood and Rousseau were,
ahem, asked to exit their former
band, The You. Conveniently, Zor-
ic and Kasler similarly took a bow
from their band, Monarch.

“We were kind of the rejects of
different bands,” said Rousseau.

“I would always say, ‘That
drummer and bass player are awe-
some.’ Apparently, they said the
same  about us. Finally, we
said we should probably just play
together,” said Zoiic. “Then we all

“Do you need earplugs?”asked
keyboardist and vocalist Brett Zor-
ic. “I think we have some paper
towels you can use.”

Thanks, but no thanks.

Zoric, all arms and legs with
thick, black-rirnmed glasses, sits
behind his dual keyboards. Trig-
gers launch into its catchiest song,
“Anyone at Anytime,” beginning
with Zo1ic’s barroom shufﬂe on
the keys. Guitarist and vocalist
Adam Rousseau’s jagged riff cuts
through the keyboard and launches
the band, along with drummer Rich
‘Woody’ Kawood and bassist Joe
Kasler, into the hyper—catchy song,
a mix of Weezer’s crunchy guitars,
Maroon 5’s white boy soul vocals
and a swagger that’s all its own.

The song ends. Silence.

Zoric cracks a  and says,
“This is usually the part where
someone yells, ‘You suckl”’

That wry humor is, at least in
part, responsible for Triggers’ ex-

and actually listening to it were two

“There’s a leap of faith you’ve
got to take with a producer. Be-
cause he might suggest something,
but if you wanted it that way, in a
sense, you would’ve written it that
way. In the end, you either trust
him or you don’t,” said Zoric,

Triggers decided to trust Hiler.
The result is 35 minutes of super
slick party rock that would make
The Cars smile wide and make

‘ Elvis Costello lower his glasses to

look a bit closer. Zoiic’s synthesizer
lines trade thumping melodies with
Rousseau’s guitar, while Kasler and
Kawood are a driving rhythmic
force —— that is, a force that’ll drive
you to the dance floor. Throw in
the gang—shouted “whoa’s” _, and
“hey’s,” and you’ve got a power-
pop punch in the gut.

Windows 7 could be an easy

solution for Vista haters

by Donald Campbell

C0/um/ziat

Microsoft is trying it again.

Vista is no longer viable for Microsoft to
continue, and it transferred all of its devel-
opment clout and attention into Windows
7. .
This might not seem overly exciting, you
might think, as Microsoft is renowned for

announcing the development of an oper— '

ating system about 10 years before it truly
comes out. Although this is a fair level of

exaggeration, Microsoft does have a knack

for leading a community on, as evidenced
by the long waiting period between the an-
nouncement of Vista’s development and the
first store-ready copy.

But because Vista was such a commercial
disaster for Microsoft, Windows 7 seems to
be jumping Micr0soft’s tendency to drag its
feet. Microsoft recently announced the re-

lease of a beta version of Windows 7. As a -
good computer engineer, I was obliged to

download it, install it and try it.

Microsoft claims that Windows 7ibranch-
es directly from user feedback. As a result,
Microsoft strived to make Windows 7 more
reliable, more efficient and less demanding
on hardware. Microsoft touts on its Web site
a set of key features of Windows 7 that are
new and “exciting.”

i Included is a better task bar with more
information about programs that can be
run. The simple icons of the Windows XP
task bar have been replaced with program
previews and basic information about a pro-
gram’s function and origins.

Also included is a new version of Inter— '

net Explorer, labeled Internet Explorer 8,
that makes searching more interactive and
quicker. With Internet Explorer 8, Micro-

 

soft hopes to allow users greater ﬂexibility
in search string misspellings, by making sug-
gestions as to search queries as the user en-
ters each character.

Microsoft Windows 7 should‘ also im-

prove on Vista and XP’s compatibility with '

hardware and should have the capability to
automatically recognize and function with
a wider selection of hardware devices. For
those devices that require post-installation
setup or property editing, Microsoft pro-
vided an “improved” device management
scheme.

Windows 7, though billed as being ul-
timately more efficient than Vista, is still a
resource hog. It requires a minimum of a
1 gHz processor with 1 GB of RAM. The
minimum requirements are the same as the
advanced versions of Windows Vista.

The install of Windows 7 is 'Vista—like.
This is onlyga major point because it seems

the days of l\/Iicrosoft graphical operating

systems being installed using a command— '

line utility are over. Excellent. A
The look and feel» of Windows 7 initially
appears as a cut—down, not—so-ﬂuffy version

‘of Vista. The task bar had been replaced

with a new stylized Windows button —
similar to the logo you see when you first
boot Vista. Right next to the start button
itself are larger icons for frequently-used
programs — or, at least, programs l\/Iicrosoft
hopes you will frequently use. The main dif-

ference between the new icons and the quick ‘

launch icons of Windows XP are their right-
click capabilities. Right-clicking on an icon
will provide a pop—up that gives you speciﬁc
tasks applicable to the program. I

Once the user clicks on the stylized Win-
dos logo, the task menu is extremely similar

‘ to the one in Vista. There are no sub—menus
as is the case in XP. Clicking on a sub-menu ’
simply shifts the task bar’s focus, requiring ,

or, and it’s good to see the band stopped “Dance, V

more entertaining subject matter

That mack, along with ‘What A Catch, Don-

While nothingis as sweet as “Golden” from 20075

and never manage to become boring

Speaking of Costello’s stint on “Donnie,” this

Of course, but so is the idea of Lil\X/ayne appearing
in a Fall Out Boy song

That would be “Ttﬁimy Blews,” an album
highlight that pairs its syncopated handdaps with
 dtawled—out lyrics This is the song most
reminiscent of Vintage Fall Out Boy, and with its
minimal dose of nostalgia, it is Very appealing

A plethora of other Fueled By Ramen label
mates, like Brendon Urie of Panicat the Discol, ap-
pear on a few tracks Deborah Hairy, of Blondie
fame, even shows up on “West Coast Smo ” a
short yet addicting arena thumper that begs listeners
to “Knock once for the Father, twice ‘for the Son,
three times for the Holy Ghost” —— adroitness is
always an FOB strength.

The CD is not without its missteps “\X/a.m.s,”
a Pharell—produced track,  warrants skip—sta—

fewer mouse movements and better use of

The file structure of Windows 7 is also
slightly different from previous Windows
versions. Documents, Music, Movies and
Pictures have all been moved into a folder
called ‘_‘Libraries.” An icon for a user’s Li-
brary folder is, conveniently located on the
task bar at Windows install time.

Hardware visualization is better in Win-
dows 7 than in previous versions of Win-

dows. Instead of cryptic lists, the Control
Panel of Windows 7 consolidates a list of

installed devices into easy-to-understand,

large icons. Manipulations of the icons al-

low users to install, remove and edit the

properties of connected hardware.
Windows Gadgets also received a face-

lift. Now, it is possible to position gadgets '

all over the desktop. This approach to on-

line gadgetry is reminiscent of the Mac-

OS X dashboard approach. Gadgets from
Windows Vista have been grandfathered in,
including the calendar, RSS news feeder and

the CPU meters.
All—in—all, Windows 7 seems to be an
improvement over Vista. Its true reliability

and compatibility characteristics have yet"

to be determined, however. For this article,
Windows 7 was given a true efﬁciency and
speed test. It was loaded on a 2.8 gHz Pen-
tium IV machine through Microsoft Virtual
PC 2007. Although the graphics were un-
derstandably slow, the install and basic oper—
ation of Windows 7 was surprisingly quick.

The operating system is still in its beta
testing stage, a stage when many last-minute

tWindows 7 keeps it simple and does away with Vista's 'fluff'

bugs are identiﬁed and worked out. Reliabil-

ity issues or glitches in the beta release are,

not necessarily indicative of the quality of
the eventual production—ready version.
From initial impressions, Windows 7 has
an equal opportunity to go in two direc-
tions. It can either be accepted completely

_ by previous Vista haters and thus succeed, .

or it can still be put on the shelf in lieu of
faster machines running legacy versions of
XP. If Windows 7 were to come out tomor-
row, I personally would continue to run XP
on my machines.

But with full-time day jobs all, recording a
full-length was no easy task.

“During pre—production, we would come
home from work at 6, then we’d work from
then until 2 in the morning, then get up for
work the next day,” said Zoric, who works in
real estate. ,

For the actual recording, though, the band
blissfully took off work to devote necessary
attention to the music.

“A lot of bands at our level end up tak-
ing months or years [to record] because ev-
eryone is working and it’s hard to get studio
time,” said Rousseau. “But we took off work,
scraped together every penny we had and

made this  in a couple weeks, just banged '

it out.” .

Smoke S/you» hit local shelves and saw the
band begin touring more than ever. But while
booking shows has proved fairly simple, the
band understands that economic woes, as well
as hunger pangs, can dissuade a listener from
checking out any band.

“We know what it’s like to put out five
bucks for a show. That’s time sitting at a job

you hate. Any time someone puts out that five 7

bucks, that’s responsibility for us,” ‘said Zoric
“From the time they come in the door, it’s our
job to make sure that person doesn’t think, ‘I
wish I’d kept that and gone to McDonald’s.’

, And that’s a choice. You can eat a footlong

sub, or you can walk down the street and see
us. It’s our job to make sure people continue
to walk down the street.”

McCoy

running

out of time

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor
LeSean McCoy still hasn’t

made public a decision of wheth— , ‘A b
er to enter the NFL Draft or stay V
in school for another year. But -

the sophomore tailback is run-
ning out of time, as the deadline
for underclassmen to ﬁle paper-

work for the April 25-26 Draft is V V '

Thursday.

McCoy is apparently still con- A ..

sidering ‘staying in school. The
sophomore, who is eligible be—
cause of a year of prep school
before enrolling at Pitt, said con-
sistently before the Sun Bowl that‘;
he planned to return. But citing
two unnamed family sources,
the Pittsburgh Tribune—Reviewi
reported on Thursday night that‘
McCoy was leaning toward enter-
ing the Draft.

He and his family met with
Pitt ‘coach Dave Wannstedt on
Friday for about 90 minutes to
discuss the decision, and he called
the coach again on Monday to let
him know he needed more time?
to come to a conclusion. Wannst—
edt told McCoy to take whatever
time he needed to decide. .

If McCoy decides to declare
early, he’ll likely be a late first-
round or early second—round se-
lection.

If he decides to come back,
he’ll have a chance to be the top-
ranked back in the nation and
could be the top back chosen in
the 2010 Draft.

the Bulls’ last game, a  road '

triumph over DePaul 80-58, the Bulls‘
starting backcourt tandem of Domin-
iquejones andjesus Verdejo combined
for 16 rebounds, heading the Bulls’ to-
tal domination on the boards in which
they outrebounded DePaul by 18.

the glass is to plug big Dejuan Blair in
the middle of the lane The sophomore
is second in the conference in rebounds

isn’t enough, Pitt touts the league’s best

The one big man Pitt might want to
pay attention to is Augustus Gilchrist,
whose athleticism and 6—feet-10inch

Saturday at DePaul off the bench. '

  Louisville looking strong as Big East battles continue

by Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬂ IV/‘iter

It’s been well documented that there are no
games off in the Big East.

 at recent conference games, a
steady trend of lower-ranked Big East oppo-

I nents stretching their higher-ranked opponents

to their limits is developing.

Watch out, look who is  a charge No.
20 Louisville is starting to rattle off some de-
cent victories and building momentum toward
a huge showdown with No. 1 Pitt on Saturday.

And finally, another huge rnatchup tips off
in our nation’s capital tonight with the 13th-
ranked Georgetown Hoyas hosting No. 8 Syra-
cuse in an early separation game.

These and other stories will be the topic in
the roundup of the week that was ir1 Big East
basketball.

Unranked teams such as Rutgers, Cincinnati,
Providence, Seton Hall and St. Johns gave many

upper—echelon Big East teams a run for their «

money for at least onehalf Rutgers only trailed

Syracuse by one at the half before the Orange .

caught ﬁre and dropped the Scarlet Knights

* 82-66. Same story, same result for Cincinnati. It

trailed Connecticut by four at the half, only to
lose 81-72.

Seton Hall and Providence led Notre Dame
and Georgetown, respectably, at the half Seton
Hall led the Irish by one only to lose by nine,
and Providence led Georgetown by three and
lost by seven. St. John’s pushed the No. 1-ranked
Pitt in the first half but fell victim to the Pan-
thers 90-67. 0

These games displayed that bench play is a

0 huge determinant of Big East success When a

team like Pitt or Connecticut can  deep into
its bench for minutes to rest its starters, that’s
when it can come out in the second half and
put teams away. '
 teams away is exactly what Louisville
has been doing lately. The Cardinals have rattled

off wins against South Florida and Vrllanova '

on the road, and they won an overtime game
against Notre Dame in just one week. The Car-

‘ dinals are  there but are not in the picture

of the Big East elite just yet.

The question is if the team has enough in
the tank for its home game against Pitt this
Saturday. A win of that caliber wouldalmost

“certainly guarantee the team at least a top 15

There could be an argument that Syracuse
plays in three matchups of the week in the
Big East this week. Tonight, the Orange travel
to Georgetown On Saturday, Syracuse hosts
Notre Dame, and on Monday Syracuse travels

‘ to Pitt. But there’s more. Onjan. 25, the Orange

host Louisville. .
Georgetown has a tough stretch of its

own with games against Syracuse, at Duke and

against West Virginia .
The key to the rnatchup is if the Orange’s

2-3 zone can frustrate Hoyas’ forward Greg
Monroe early. If the Orange collapse and neu-
tralize Monroe, the Hoyas are forced to rely on

the 3-pointer. This happened against Pitt, and ’

eventually their lack of a post game caught up
to them.
On to the awards:

Big East Hammer on the Hardwood
Louisville forward Terrence Wﬂliarns is '
starting to heat up.  Louisville’s last three
wins, he has scored four, 10 and 24 points He’s
also grabbed 35 rebounds in those three games

 

The senior led Louisville by slashing and creat-

ing off the dribble against Notre Dame.

Big East Cupcake
Vllanova’s Antonio Pena had a chance to tie
‘ or take the lead with four seconds to go against
Louisville last Saturday. But the sophomore for-

ward missed two free throws. Then the Wﬂd— _

cats missed three consecutive layup attempts to
lose by one to the Cardinals.

Big East Matchups to Watch

As previously mentioned, stay tuned to Syr-
acuse and Georgetown tonight. Also, look out

for the Orange’s next game against Notre Dame
on Saturday and Georgetowns showdown with

Duke the same day. On Monday, Syracuse trav- in

els to Pitt for a huge showdown with the Pan-
thers at the Petersen Events Center.

Upset Alert of the Week

Louisville could give Pitt plenty of problems ﬂ_ 
by playing a tough press and forcing turnovers T

from Panthers coachjamie Dixon’s bench play-
ers. Dixon might not be able to sub out his start-
ersasmuchashewantstointhegame, forcing
them to play longer minutes.
