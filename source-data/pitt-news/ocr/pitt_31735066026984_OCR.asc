By Scott Emmert
Staff Writer

Staff, faculty and senate
members voiced their strong
opposition to the decision by
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
to drop HealthAmerica from
the university’s medical cover-
age at yesterday’s University
Senate meeting.

In previous months both
Faculty Assembly and Senate
Council had been considering
three health care options.

To continue Pitt's current cov- '

erage by far garnered the most
support. Petitions for that

option gained 1,200 signatures. V

‘Surveys sent out to faculty and
staff showed that 73 percent
were opposed to any single
vendor option.

In their last meetings before
yesterday’s University Senate
meeting, both the Senate
Council and Faculty Assembly

. voted overwhelmingly to main-
tain Pitt's current system of cov- .

erage. V

“I do not challenge the right
of administration to make deci-
sions that are administrative,”
senate member Barbara Shore
said. “But I do think that we
ought not have a process in
which it appears that people are
going to have significant or
meaningful input, and then it
doesn’t happen.

“The desicion was made after
all of the concerned parties put
their opinion on the table,”
O’Connor said, responding to
Shore.

Despite rain, a failing public
address system and a counter-
demonstration, the protest
against the Contract with
America soldiered on at the side
of the Wﬂharn Pitt Union.

Yesterday’s protest, co-spon-
sored‘ by the Citizens’
Campaign Fund, the Lesbian
and Gay Academic Association
at Pitt, the Lesbian Avengers,
Pitt English Graduate Student
Organization and the Rainbow
Kitchen, was held along with
over 100 others across the coun-
try in opposition to the

Among the organizers was
Lisa Frank, representing Carlow
College.

“In the Nov. election a whop-

Republican-led legislation plan-. ‘

ping 23 percent of eligible vot-
ers actually voted,” Frank said.
“And of those, only 52 percent
of those supported candidates
who signed the contract 
we’ve got an 87 percent section

of the American public who

simply can not be construed as
signatories to this trust.

“If this is supposed to be a
contract that was signed with
America, then this must be one
of those stealth contracts,” said
Frank. “This is like the
Columbia Record House kind of
contract where you get a little
card in the mail that says,
‘unless we hear otherwise, we’ll
send you a CD and then we’ll,
tax you to build prisons, and
then we’ll take away your chil-
dren and your student loans, and
repeal affirmative action legisla-
tion’ . ”

Contract with America.

Protest «gains! Conlrucl

Also speaking at the rally was
the Chair of the Alliance for
Progressive Action, Rick
Adams. He spoke of the need
for students to be at the forefront
of the movement on opposition
of the contract. “Don’t just act
out of self-interest that they’re
coming after you, but realize
that they’re coming after every-
one in America,” said Adams. '

“This Contract on America
clearly is an attack on women,
African Americans, Latinos
Americans, Asian Americans,
students and children,” said
Adams. “Probably the most
tragic thing is that the politicians
have decided that they will
attack those who are least able
to speak and organize and ﬁght
for themselves.”

For M Pia News

On Saturday, all Pitt students
are invited to a huge party, called
the Bigelow Bash, which will
feature bands, games and food.

The event, sponsored by Pitt
Program Council, will take place
from noon to 5 p.m. on Bigelow
Boulevard between Fifth and

Forbes avenues. The street will

be closed off to motorists.
Organizers said admission into
the bash will be free.

.“It seems to be something the
students have wanted, and we
have been trying to make happen
for some time now,” said Tom
Misuraca, Pitt assistant director
of student alfairs.

Local bands such as Brownie
Mary, The Flow Band and The
Clarks will perform on the Fifth
Avenue end of the block.
Students will also be able to
dress up for “antique” photos
and try singing in a recording
booth. 9

According to Misuraca,
booths setup by Food Services
will accept student meal plans,
and other vendors have agreed to
offer a discount on food and
merchandise.

“Rather than us making a
commission on what the vendors
sell, they’ve agreed to sell to stu-
dents at 20 percent below what
their normal prices are,” said
Misuraca.

Greek Week to begin

By Peter Knezevich
Sgﬂ Writer A

It is springtime again, and ._

every spring on campuses
nationwide fraternities and
sororities hold Greek Week

At Pitt, like most schools,
Greek Week combines a number
of activities intoa two-week fes-
tival. Some of the events slated
for this years agenda are Greek
Sing, a 5k nm/3k walk, a blood
drive and a dance marathon.

Stephanie Mescall, historian‘
for Greek Week, was adamant
about the amount of work each
chapter puts into these events.

“It’s extremely stressful,” said
Mescall. “It’s based on competi-
tion for the Greeks, it motivates

them.” V .
The highlight of this week-

ends activities is Greek Sing. .

Fraternities and sororities pair
up and recite various Broadway
tunes together. Some of the pop-
ular perfonnances include songs
from, “Guys and Dolls,”
“Tommy,” “Anything Goes’_’
and “Sound of Music.”

Deanna Angello, chairperson
for Greek Week, said this year’s
Greek Sing promises to be more

P entertaining than in years past.

“People will_enjoy it a lot
more because of the combined
format,” said Angello.
“Fratemities and sororities will
team up to provide a better
show.”

Through the waiting room filled
with deceivingly comfortable-
looking furniture, Tim Girone,
the 24-year-old resident body-
piercer; for Inka Dinka Doo
Tattooing and-Bodypiercing Studio,

, comes in panting holding a muddy

mountain bike seat post. He sits
down, wiping the sweat from his
brow.

Across from him sits Zeb, the new
maintenancelsterilizerl gopher at

down a frantic list of how his day .
went so far (it’s now 3 p.m.), his
deliberately long ride to work and
what’s on today’s piercing agenda.

He ducks into the piercing studio,
which is off from the tattooing sec-
tion of Inka Dinka Doo’s floor plan,
as Zeb runs out to get the tattoo

, -From page 1
Senate [Council’s] vote was to
maintain the status quo. That
recommendation was heard. It
simply wasn’t followed,”
O’Connor said.

O’Connor and other adminis-
trative officials based the deci-
sion to make Blue Cross the
university’s sole provider on
several factors. With Blue Cross
as sole providerthe university
will supposedly save $5 million
over the next three years based
on a guarantee that rates would
not rise.

“The chancellor is not_in a
position to ignore the savings of
millions of dollars,” Provost
James Maher said. “We, like
every major university, are
under major ﬁnancial strains.”

Another factor involved was
that HealthAmerica coverage
did not include University of

physicians in its sole.provider
plan.

position to be in a soul source

Tony Urbanek, Inka Dinka Doo’s
main skin artist/owner, and Shaky

upcoming national tattoo conven-
tion in Lexington, Ky., their day
has already been long under
way. , .
Girone reappears. He has shed his
cycling clothes and has donned slick
new white sneakers, black jeans and
a fresh white T-shirt. He smooths
his hand forward through his short
black hair.

The doctor is in.

I Girone began piercing himself
about six years ago and eventually
obtained an apprenticeship in
Philadelphia. He is now one of
only two people in Pittsburgh unof-
ficially in the body-piercing profes-
sion. '

“I love piercing, and I’ll keep
doing it and making my living at it
as long as I can.”

Body piercing is a rising new fad

_ of the 19905. What started out as

something more underground is now
very mainstream. Now no one is
safe from piercings ——- the girl next
door, the student in the seat next to
you, even your teacher.
Anthony Faranda, a 24 year-old

civil engineering major, said he

pierces his body in his own personal A

studio.
“I first did my nipple about five

‘years ago,” Faranda said. “My

friend Jody had his done. I thought
it was pretty neat. It was basically a
drunk thing. The ring was just a sil-
ver earring, I did it with a safety
pin-.”' ‘ -

His arsenal now consistsof a ring

his nipples, a one-inch rod through
the head of his penis and three rings
through his scrotum.

Anyone who is tragically hip
would like to have it done but
would rather leave it up to some-
one who is an experienced profes-
sional. Although these so-
called professionals (so-called
because there is no certification
required to be one) know what
they’re doing and have been doing
so for years, but is there still
the same amount of pain in-
volved?

voiced their complaints over the
quality of service that Blue
Cross would provide, and the
inconvenience they would incur
with having to use different
medical facilities.

“I’ve been at HealthAmerica
for 17 years,” said faculty mem-

it. Everyone’s friendly and now

other things, thecontract would
call for block grants issued to the
states to pay for welfare.

“The reason we don’t have
block grants to the states is
because many of the things that
we rely on as a people, to have

equality of life that’s worth living,
is provided by the federal govern-
ment because historically the
states wouldn’t do it,” Adams
said.

As others took the podium to
speak, chants in support of the
contract could be heard.

“You have a_right to be here, so
do we,” said Booker Stallworth,
who is in support of the contract
Stallworth said he was
approached by an organizer of
the protest and told he and others
would be removed if they contin-
ued to disrupt the event

Citing the student handbook,
“Apparently they’re not allowed
to have a political rally,” said
Stallworth. “So they’re calling
this educational, but they’re» not
allowing for a question and
answer period and the Socialist
party has a table set up.”

‘‘It’s funny, I don’t think peo-
ple really see how hard it is and
how much time it takes to
accomplish this,” said Doug
Segal, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council. “If you ever
want to see a bunch of students
do something for themselves and
for other people, just come.
These students have put in hours
upon hours putting a show
together.”

The other people Segal was
referring to are the residents of

Family House. Greek Sing and

all the other events are centered
around raising money for this
charity. Following Greek Sing
will be Saturday’s 5k run/3k
walk, a morning jaunt through
Schenley park. Students partici-
pating will receive a free T-shirt
and be treated to Bruegger’s
Bagels along the way. »

“People cheer you on, and
there are food and beverages
provided to participants,” said
Angello. “I’ll be walking
though.”

Bash

-From page 1

Although final details have
not been worked out yet, the
Residence Student Association
is expected to co-sponsor the
Bash. .

“We decided to incorporate
two organizations’ events, so it
will be an all-encompassing pro-
gram for the university commu-
nity,” said Leslie Tullio, execu-
tive board director of Pitt
Program Council.

Andy Miller, president of the
RSA, said his organization
wants to bring in several games
and activities, including sumo
wrestling and a Velcro wall that
students can jump on.

If the weather-does not coop-
erate on the day of the event,
organizers said, they will have
to cancel the bash. They said
there would be too many ven-
dors and games to move

Share the health

Pitt’s status as the largest liver transplant center in the country is
being threatened by changes in the method of distribution of donor
livers. The United Network for Organ Sharing created a new sys-

‘ tern which gives preference to people in the area where the liver is

donated over all other considerations.

This does not take into consideration the patient’s chance for
survival. Such a system‘ puts smaller centers and Pitt at odds.
Before this system, Pitt and other larger centers received most of
the donor organs. The sickest patients usually end up in these larg-
er centers. Doctors in smaller centers argue that their smaller cen-
ters get patients who are most likely to survive over the long term.

Despite this fact, UPMC has had above average survival rates
for its patients. Balancing what is best for sick people in a case
like this is difficult. What determines a_ good quality of life is
debatable, yet it is often at the core of these things.

Ultimately, allocating livers or other donated organs on a
regional basis is ineffective at best. It would be much better to
evaluate things on a case-by-case basis. Allowing a panel of med-
ical experts to review cases would allow those in most dire need to
receive organs in a timely manner. Certainly the goal of any allo-
cation system ought to be helping those who can attain a high
quality of life. This narrowly designed system ought to be modi-
fied to help those who come to large centers and are in need.
Regional considerations should not be the only determining factor.

Apathy abounds

Today, it was easy to see why New York is a better city than
Pittsburgh. When the Hare Krishnas were -walking to the protest
outside of the William Pitt Union, people would gawk so much
so that the Krishnas kept their attention unless the gawker actu-
ally ran into you. What protest, you ask? There was an event on
the Union lawn designed to educate and mobilize people against
the Republican Contract with America programs.

More likely, any awareness of it probably went something like
this:

“Hi, Susan, did you see the protest?” .

“Is that what was going on when I was walking to the
Cathedral this aftemoon?”

Does this sound vaguely familiar? An informal count made
from The Pitt News office yielded about 80 people, of whom at
least seven were Pitt police and 10 were staunch Republican
partisans. The protest itself lasted about an hour. But what did it
accomplish?

Well, leaﬂets were handed out to explain what the contract
was and to provide an opposing‘ viewpoint. The Republicans got
to have a warm fuzzy experience with one another, but as a
whole, it seemed to accomplish little except provide a letter for
The Pitt News. '

So, while it is good to get people involved, there is nonethe-
less a need to be effective. Merely annoying people who are tak-

ing exams should not be the point of any protest. Messages over

the Internet are not the way to mobilize people. In the future,
groups like the College Republicans and University Democrats
should work to provide open forums which honestly seek to
provide both sides of an issue and educate the students to think
for themselves.

China’s success need not be India 's failure

ith the health of
Deng Xiaoping
reportedly declining,

more articles are appearing in
the US.’ press about the future
of _China. In particular, these
writers discuss what effects
Deng’s death will have on=U.S.
business interests in China.
My guess is that it will have
little or no effect at all.
Nevertheless, many of these

journalists are mentioning.

India as a possible rival to
China for U.S. investment.
The reasons cited for this are
varied, but the most prominent
is the political system.

A recent editorial in the
Wall Street Journal cited a
Japanese diplomat as saying
that “on the surface China
looks stable, but underneath
it’s not, on the surface India
looks chaotic, but underneath
it’s stable.” The author then
goes on to explain that the
chaos that ‘sometimes results
from India’s pluralistic politi-
cal system is a plus. Maybe
so, but I doubt it. In the past
China has clearly done a bet-
ter job than India at promot-
ing ethnic and racial stability.
Violent clashes among the

pmajority Hindus and the

minority Muslims have
occurred frequently since
India gained its independence
in 1947. In addition, there are
still the questions of Kashmir
and Pakistan that must even-
tually be settled.

When one takes a balanced
overview of the political and
socioeconomic conditions of
present-day India, one finds a
nation that has many of the
benefits of ‘developed coun-
tries, while at the same time
struggling to deal with many
of the problems similar to
those of the Third World.
India is a semi- parliamen-
tary democracy that has ben-
efited greatly from three cen-
turies of a system patterned
on British-style rule of law.
This is one major reason that
India is so attractive to out-
side investors. In this respect,

India has a distinct advantage

over China. The McDonald’s
in Beijing is just one of the
most recent victims of a sys-
tem that is still largely unreg-
ulated by laws to protect for-
eign investors. In this area,
the Indian market may be
somewhat safer than the
Chinese market.

In 1991 Prime Minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao imple-
mented economic reforms
aimed at attracting foreign
investment. Thus far, the
results have been mixed.
Foreign investment has cer-
tainly increased since the
reforms began and American
companies are definitely
interested in India’s growing
market as was evidenced by
the trips to India earlier in
the year by Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown and
Energy Secretary Hazel
O’Leary. However, despite
billions of dollars of invest-
ment commitment over the

past four years, only around‘

$300 million of direct
American investment has
reached India.

As has been the case in
other developing countries,
India’s economic liberaliza-
tion policies have shifted
power from thelcentral gov-
ernment in Delhi back to the
many states. By most recent
accounts this strategy
appears to be working.
India’s middle class of con-
sumers continues to grow
and currently numbers
around 200 million, which
makes India a huge market
for outside investors. One
possible problem in the eco-
nomic sphere comes from the
ultra: nationalists in the gov-
ernment who still remain sus-
picious of foreign investment
and multinational companies.
It is these sort of officials
who had control of the econ-
omy and prevented the
Indian market to be open to

outside investment before-

Rao began his reforms in
1991.

The other «potential diffi-
culty is the fact that India is

still a developing country and
many of its people ‘remain
extremely poor. The reforms
have yet to help improve
their standard of living and
the government is concerned
about social unrest. On the
other hand, Prime Miiiister
Rao seems determined to
prevent the collapse of his
economic reforms. He has
promised more funding for
the alleviation of poverty and

is a staunch supporter of the ‘

stock market.

As for social and demo--

graphic factors, India still
looks very much like a devel-

oping nation. Overpopulation

is clearly a problem that the
government will have to deal
with if India is ever to
achieve sustainable develop-
ment. Currently India has a
population of over 911 mil-
lion people. While this is
considerably less than
China’s 1.2 billion, India’s
annual population growth
rate is higher than China’s,
1.9 percent vs. 1.1 percent.
Many demographers feel that
India will overtake China as
the world’s most populated
country sometime in the next
century. However, recently
India’s? growth rate has been
slowing due to family plan-
ning policies and improved
socioeconomic conditions in
India’s wealthier states. The
government will be able to
further lower these rates if it
improves the educational
level of the majority of the
population. Currently, 48
people of the Indian people
are illiterate.

Four years is not long
enough to tell whatthe future
holds for India’s economy,
but it seems that the country
is at long last on the path to
economic development. In a
free market and world econo-
my, there is plenty of foreign
investment to go around.

China’s success need not be ,

India’s failure, or vice versa.

Liberals throwing childlike tantrums over loss of contro

Republican president was blocking good legisla-

tion passed by the Democratic Congress. For the
ﬁrst two years of President Clinton’s term, liberal critics
had no one to blame for the utter ineffectiveness of gov-
ernment. They could hardly blame it on the president,
because he was one of them. They couldn’t blame it on
the Congress, because it was controlled by fellow liber-
als.

Critics had only the minority Republican Party to
blame, and blame they tried. What they forgot was‘ that
the Republican minority could not effectively block any-
thing unless supported by at least part of the Democrat
majority. _

With the Republican victory last November (terrne
“hostile takeover’ ’ by liberal opponents), the Republican-
controlled Congress gave critics something new to whine
about. Liberal opponents to the Republican Congress
love to claim that only 30—some percent of eligible voters
voted in the midterm elections, so the Republican victory
is not an accurate measure of public sentiment. My -point
is this: those people who did vote are the important voic-
es. The majority of those voices chose the Republican
Party, hence the new majority in Congress. But I digress,
so let me return to my point. ‘

Interestingly, those same critics who endlessly parmed
the government for its ineffectiveness during that “lroni-
ble decade of the ‘80s” were confused by the newly
Republican-controlled Congress. The party promised to
get something done and to eliminate useless aspects of
government.

Critics were poised to attack the new Congress if it did
not fulfill its promise. But when, in the ﬁrst few days of

F 12 years, we constantly heard about how the

sitting, the 104th Congress began to accomplish things,
liberal critics were at a loss. So they did what revisionists
usually do — they twisted the truth and manipulated the
facts until they had something (though incorrect) they
could reasonably oppose.

Liberals found another new target in Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich, portrayed by the media as a
power—hungry demagogue. Everything that happens in
this country is now, according to the media, at least in

‘some way the fault of Newt Gingrich. He is accused of

stealing food out of the mouths of children, stealing from
the—poor to give to the rich, stealing from the elderly and
any number of other heinous acts.

The Contract with America (yes, with — not on,
about, to, for or any other preposition) has also been a
hot topic. Along with Speaker Gingrich, the contract is
panned by liberals as the beginning of the end of civiliza-
tion as we know it. _

' If anyone is not yet familiar with the contract, or at
least with what it entails, let me tell you what the docu-
ment says. The Contract does nothing more than
promise: “within the first 100 days of the 104th
Congress, we shall bring to the House Floor the follow-
ing bills, each to be given full and open debate.”. The
contract does not claim that any or all included items will
become law, only that they will be introduced to the
House for debate.

To those who have decried the Contract with America,
I ask this question: how did the Republican Party take
control of Congress? The Republican Party victory last
November was due to public dissatisfaction with the
state of government prior to the rnidternr elections. The
Contract with America was not hidden from the public

prior to the elections. In fact, it was published in (of all
places) the TV Guide.

In March 28’s edition of The Pitt News, Evan Gallahou I

attacked the Contract as a fascist, neo-Nazi attempt at
brainwashing America. Apparently, Gallahou forgot
which side brought us speech codes, revisionist history,
taking of private property without due compensation and
the right to do whatever the government tells us we can
do (it was certainly NOT the Republicans). Gallahou
even concluded his article, ever so subtly, with the phrase
“Heil, Newt!”

Let me then address this to anyone who might consid-
er believing this anti-Newt, anti-contract ridiculousness.
If you have ever taken a civics course in high school, you
might remember that the Speaker of the House does not
rule alone. He is not an absolute monarch of Supreme
Power. In fact, he does not rule at all. While he does have
the ability to introduce legislation to the House, the
speaker is merely another elected member of Congress
chosen by the majority-party to sit at its head. The
Speaker does not alone make law, no more so than does
the president alone make laws. -

The United States government is founded on a system
of checks and balances which do not allow one person to

. rule anything. It appears that a lot of people have forgot-

ten» that. The fact is, the public made its choice in
November when we cast our votes. Liberals are now
throwing childlike, public temper-tantrums because they
do not have sole control anymore. I carmot think of a bet-
ter term to describe all the political rhetoric spewed by
liberal activists than “bad loser.” \

Erika Kendra is sick of liberal whining and sore
losers.

Rally not "educational"

The “Protest Against the Contract ‘on’
America” rally staged on the William Pitt
Union lawn on Wednesday, March 29,
should not have happened. Union reserva-
tion restrictions, as listed in the “Guide to
Wrlliarn Pitt Union” handout distributed at
the Reservations Ofﬁce, says on page .5,
“Potential users may not  reserve space for
non-certiﬁed student organizations.” The
sponsors of this rally, the Citizen’s
Campaign fund, the Lesbian and Gay
Academic Association, Pitt English GSO
and the Rainbow Kitchen, are not certiﬁed
Pitt student organizations  according to
the. .. union. This was a simple breach of
university policy.

The rally was listed as an “educational
rally.”  The very advertisement for it said
“Protest ...” The organizers lied. It was a
political rally, against the Republican agen-

da, as demonstrated by speakers and hand-
outs and rhetoric used in the rally. The
guidelines for Political Campaign Activities
are listed. A campaign is not limited to polit-
ical candidates, and by any deﬁnition is
something connected in a series of events
designed to bring about a particular result. In
that section of the guidelines, it states, “No
outdoor rallies are permitted All programs
must be educational [and have] a question
and answer period.” A question and answer
period was requested at the “educational”
rally, but none was given.

The organizers called for police to
remove eight students, the Republicans 
because they were talking with the protest-
ers, and  disturbing the rally. Then the
organizer approached us. I could not hear
him speak because of the speakers in use by
the rally. Instead of educating 
Republicans, they wanted to remove us,

while we  hungrily awaited the question
and answer period.

...ancl government for all

Despite the fact that I am a Republican
and pleased with thecurrent makeup of
Congress, there are trends our system that
trouble me.

Our government was founded with the
belief that it would have the consent of the
governed. A legitimate government arises
from voluntary agreement that binds the
rulers to the ruled Government is to be for

the public good, not for the private advan-

tage of a certain individual or class. Further,
in a legitimate fonn of government, citizens
obey the law with the belief that the laws
will defend and secure their rights. All of_
these ideas come from our founding fathers.

Now when you look at our special-inter-
est, career-politician-dorninated Congress
do the aforementioned ideas come to mind?
The latest Time/CNN poll shows that 59

percent of the public disapproves of what .

Congress is doing. Is this consent of the
governed? When Congressmen take special
interest money, is that for public good or
their own gain? One lookat our criminal
justice system and it is clear that the law-
obeying citizen’s rights are not secured.
That idea is turned on its head in our system,

because only the accused and incarcerated‘

have rights today.

i The bottom line is that our current system
does not operate as intentioned. These dis-
turbing trends lead me to wonder if our sys-
tem is still legitimate, or would be in the
eyes of the people who set it up.

There is toomuch uncertainty in understanding academia

ur university is really help-
Dng me to take measure.

Applying the practical
benchmarks of the different hard
sciences, I can quantify, catalogue
and statistically square most areas
of observation. Physics, engineer-
ing and computer science are
deﬁnitively hard but there is solace
in the set answers that can be deci-
phered in these ﬁelds.

Why is it then that in Academia
there’s so much more uncertainty
as far as understanding people is
concerned? And, based on over-
heard conversations on campus,
many others are striving to micro-
manage their holy-macro calcula-
tions of others.

I overheard the following
exchange as I walked past the
Student Union:

First Guy: “Gee, you know she’s
really knockin’ me!”

Second Guy, shrugging his
shoulders: “What tirne’s your next
class?”

Bytlristimelhadwalkedoutof
ear shot so I don’t know how the
conversation ended but it did make

me wonder about a few things.

First, though a tenn was used in
a slang manner, the two chaps
seemed to completely understand
each other. I doubt if “she’s really
knockin’ me” was ever used by the
ﬁrst guy before in a conversation.
It seemed to be an ad hoc, spur of
the moment phrase. But the second
guy was able to translate.

How did he do this? Was it arbi-
trary? Did “really knockin”’ mean
as in a macho, mushy physical
attraction, or did it mean as in
knocked into the abyss of an unre-
quited love? .

My interpretation from the ﬁrst
guy’s intonations and body lan-
guage was toward the heart throb
theory. And I believe that the sec-
ond guy also read his friend the
same way.

Is this reading as ephemeral as
an electronic mail message? Using
some complex and somewhat con-
trived internal matrix we judge the
meanings of conversations. Call it
a hunch, call it lack of facts, call the
“Psychic Hotline,” we believe we
know people without asking them

what they’re feeling and believing.
How ridiculous! Why don’t we
ask? Even Wheel of Fortune con-
testants know to buy a vowel or
keep asking until they can solve
the puzzle.

' Perhapsitis morefunnottoask.
After all, I don’t care for a conver-
sation that resemblee twenty ques-
tions. That isn’t a dialogue. It’s
more like “shove a log” and leave
me alone.

More likely, we don’t ask
because the other person can’t
answer, can’t exactly express what
they’re feeling or doesn’t give a
straight answer.‘ For example: over-
heard conversation number two:

First Girl: “Could it be we’ll go
to Orlando?”

Second Girl: “You Goofy or
what?”

Ibelievethatwhatlheardinthe
reply was an attempt at a joke. In
addition to the humor, it seemed
the second giri was questioning the
monetary sanity of the ﬁrst girl.
Implied in the reply was the fact
that the two would never have
enough money to go to hot Florida

On ,.5P1'i11g Break. Maybe they
could afford some steamy french
fries from a local greasy spoon, but
not Florida.

It’s amazing that we have the
ability to hear and see so much
more in conversations than is acui-
ally being said or asked about. But,
not as amazing as the silliness and
happenstanoe of the banter on TV.
Just watch any sporting event and
listen for the play-by-play
announcer to say the following:

Announcer. “Oh boy, they really
dodged a bullet!”

Now, what in heaven’s riﬂe
ranges does this mean? I’ve been
in some tough city locales; heck,
here on Pitt's campus things can be
rough, but I can’t say that I’ve
dodged a bullet lately. I’ve had
some diﬂicult accounting tests, but
they were more brain threatening

"than life threatening. So, though

the announcer’s analogy is melo-
dramatic, I guess that I do under-
stand his point.

Somehow, through the mix of
television, family'and friends, we

falsely portraying their true feel-
ings. TV seems to be the worse
offender. Don’t believe for a sec-
ond the instant relief, associated
with any product in the diarrhea
commercials. ’

If you want to have some fun,
quietly stand back and watch and
listen to some people having a con-
versation. As you watch, try to
guess the “true” meanings and
emotions that they are exchanging.

- If you really want to be bold, after
- you made your judgments, go and

ask the group you were watching
to verify your observations.
On second thought, you better

"not. Otherwise, you might end up

getting a Hallmark card full of
emotions as you lay in the hospital
recovering from the beating you
received for snooping.

And I bet you always thought

Pitt student Anthony Faranda‘said he pierced his nipple
about ﬁve years ago. “It was basically a drunk thing. The
ring was just a silver earring. I did it with a safety pin.”

Faranda also remembers the only piercing that
hurt him, rather vividly.

“The penis [piercing] was pretty bad,” Faranda
said. ’

“It bled a lot. I did it freehand. I didn’t use forceps
or anything which stretches the skin and distributes
the pressure. It goes through about an inch of
skin.”

Girone did not recommend this type of home-

ypiercing, but “as long as he knows what he’s doing,

and if he can withstand the pain there’s nothing
wrong with it,” he said.

Girone said he pierces at least a dozen people
every weekend; “About 85 percent of that are girls,
they’re getting different car, eyebrow and navel
piercings.” ,

Katie Sesny, 22, had her navel pierced last year.
“I basically got it done because it was my birth-
day,” she said, “and I was done with my last day of

finals from college for life. It was a pretty crazy
thing for me to do. I’m a pretty mild mannered little
lady.’’ I '

Sesny claims that it is actually no big deal. “No
one sees it, and I don’t really wear clothes that
reveal it. Basically it’s just there.”

Zork from
Ork: The

shocking
  untold story

 

lanet ,
Ork
launche

 d two giant
 eggs 32 years
‘ ago. One

landed in
. Boulder,
gigllilnnlst Colo., the
other in
Duncan Brooklyn.
The
eggs were targeted for Gary,

Ind., but solar winds blew
them off course.

The leader of Ork sent the
eggs, each with an alien
inside, to collect data from the
human species. The Orkians
took on human identities and
proceeded to live as function-
ing U.S. citizens.

The Boulder-based Orkian,
Mork, dazzled humans with
his ability to move objects
with his ﬁnger, and swept a
young lady off her feet with
his childish charm. Everyone
seemed to like Mork, and
Mork appeared to like every-
one. ,

However, the Brooklyn-
based Orkian, Zork, didn’t
adapt too well to his new envi-
ronment, so he moved with his
foster family down south.

This is where Zork morphed
into an everyday American.
But people still found his
name odd, and they made fun
of him constantly. After long
days working the assembly
line, Zork would go to local
playgrounds and play basket-
ball because everyone else
was doing it.

Soon, Zork became a prod-
uct of his environment, and he
started to excel at basketball.
His uncanny jumping ability
awed the local talent,’but he
would never get respect he
deserved because all the play-
ers would laugh and make fun
of his name. “Zork, Zork, you
ugly dork,” they would spite-
fully chant. Zork couldn’t
stand the ridicule, so he
changed his name to Mike.

Mike then quit his job to
form a new identity. He began
to play basketball more fre-
quently — from sunrise to
sundown Mike would be out
shooting around. The game
came easy to Mike —— it was
basic Orkian geometry.

One player ﬁnally asked
Mike how he jumped so high,
and Mike replied, “Because
I’m from the air.” All the play-
ers laughed, but it was true -
he was spawned from outer
space and hasn’t quite adjust-
ed to gravity yet.

The myth of Mike’s incredi-
ble leaping ability soared him

Baseball continues to struggle

  By Matt Groff

Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team con-
tinued its slide Tuesday after-
noon in Ohio as they fell to
the Akron Zips, 9-2. The loss
is the fifth straight for the
Panthers, whose record falls

to 16-7 after jumping out to a ‘

16-2 start.

The Panthers only managed
six base hits in the effort
against an Akron squad that
knocked three home runs to
keep the Zips in the driver’s
seat most of the day. Akron
finished with four extra base
hits to Pitt’s zero.

Junior lefty Jason Shields
was tagged. with the loss after
giving up six runs, all earned,
in two innings of work.
Shields was lifted in favor of
hurler Gregg Mrochko in the
third, who proceeded to shut
Akron down before giving up
three more runs in the eighth.

Before Akron’s five-run
second inning explosion, Pitt
held a slim 1-0 lead. One out
into the game, centerfielder
Jason Conti singled and stole

 

second after third baseman
Jon DeBemardis ﬂied to cen-
ter. Tyler Shantz, Pitt’s desig-
nated hitter, put the Panthers
on the board first by stroking
a base hit to left, scoring
Conti.

Conti said Pitt will have to

start getting some big hits in‘

‘order to get back to their win-

- ning ways, especially against
the powerful Big East teams .

which await the Panthers in
the coming weeks. '

“We’re just not getting the
timely hitting we need right
now,” Conti said. - '

Pitt’s lone run‘ in the next
eight innings came when they
trailed 6-.1 in the fourth
inning.

With one out, first baseman
Rob Garvey singled to left
center and shortstop Sam
Crowley followed with a sin-
gle to right. Pinch hitter Jim
Morrison reached on a field-
er’s choice, moving Garvey to
third. After allowing Morrison
to steal second and working a
full count to leftfielder Bob
Miller, Akron starter Jim
Benedict threw a pitch in the

dirt. Garvey scored on the
wild pitch, which rolled to the
screen. .

Benedict got the win for the
Zips, while Akron players
Jason Fizet, E.J. Heckert and
Rob Susey all had multiple-hit
games and each chipped in
home runs.

Pitt’s schedule does not get
easier any time soon, with
powerhouse Seton Hall com-
ing here in mid-April right
before Pitt travels to UConn
for a three game series.

“As a team, I don’t think
we’re playing with a lot of
confidence,” Garvey said. “At
this point we’re not playing
within the system as much as
we should be.”'

St. John’s comes to town
this weekend for a three-game
series with the Panthers, with
the action starting at noon on
Saturday and Sunday at Trees
Field. The Red Storm, which
was featured in last week’s
Sports Illustrated, represented
the United States in the Pan-
American games this year and
figures to be a major threat in
the Big East. '

Fran Davis returns Youngstown's Tarra Pavlosky's shot yesterday. Davis won 6-1, 7-5.

By Jim Wheeler
Staff Writer

The Youngstown State
Penguins came to the Cost Center
yesterday and received a punish-
ing defeat from the Lady
Panthers. The score was 5-2.

Coach George Dieffenbach was
all smiles because his team need-
ed a win to carry with them to
Villanova this weekend.

“This was a necessary confi-
dence builder for the women’s
team,” said Dieffenbach. “This
gave us aigood chance to work on
our games, to establish ourselves,
to get more aggressive again and
to work on some of our weak-
nesses.” .

In singles action, Alison.Baker,
playing at the No. 1 spot, was
defeated by Santi Nalluri (6-1, 6-

2). Tamara Kalesnik was also .

defeated. Her match came down
to a tie-breaker which she lost 7-3.

Fran Davis defeated Tarra
Pavlosky 6-1, 7-5.

“I think we played pretty well
today,” said Davis. “Everyone
played singles well, which is good
because we have a very hard
match coming up. We’re going to
Villanova with the boys and it’s
going to be a tough match. We
got good practice today for that
match.”

In other singles matches Marla
Zielinski, Tammy Keister and
Kristen Siegel had no problem
icing their Lady Penguin oppo-
nents.

“I think as a whole our team
played really well today,” said
Siegel smiling proudly.

Due to the time when doubles

action started, the match which
Baker and Keister were to play
ended in default because‘Baker
had .to leave to take a test.
However, the Panthers won the
other two matches and received
the one team point.

Siegel and Deborah Baird shut

out Kristy Zagotti and Dawn —

Eneritt by a score of 6-0. Davis
and Zielinski had a little more
trouble with their opponents, but
defeated them 8-6. '

“I’d say the team had a solid
performance today,” said
Zielinski. “Fran and I played solid
doubles, which is good. We’ll be
ready for the Big East teams com-
ing up like Villanova.”

The Lady Panthers’ record now
stands at 10-8. They will travel to

Vrllanova to play this Saturday at .

9 am.

Paul Kogut
Staff Writer

After getting banged
around the court for
six games in a row,
Pitt’s men’s tennis
team needed a confi-
dence builder. They
needed a victory. They
needed . the
Youngstown State
University Penguins.
Yesterday afternoon
they got them.

The Panthers (7-7)
rudely welcomed the
Penguins to the Cost
Center by earning wins
in all five singles
matches and both dou-
bles matches that were
played. And they won
them in convincing-
fashion. Pitt’s Brad.

2 Wade, the team’s No.
2 seed, beat Doug
Jones 6-2, 6-1, and
that was par for the
court, so to speak.

The Panthers also
won two matches — a
singles and doubles ——
by default, en route-to

Penguins.

After dropping six in
a row, including recent
losses to strong-arms
Penn State and West
Virginia, “the team
was very hungry for a
victory,’_’ ‘coach George
Dieffenbach said. _“We
played offensively, and
we played agressively
today.”

Junior Mike “Thor”
Sullivan cruised to a‘
6-2, 6-2 win over
Youngstown State’s
Chris Parker. Sullivan
attacked Parker’s serve
and controlled the vol-
leying. At times,
Sullivan said his
biggest worry was just
keeping the ball in
play. “I set the pace, I
didn’t let him set it,”
he said. _,

Braden Doherty, a
sophomore and Pitt’s
top-seeded player, beat
Ken Cataland 6-1, 6-1.
Doherty’s serve was in
particularly good
form. “That’s impor-
tant,” he said. “The
serve sets up my
whole game plan pret-
ty much. It can put

. things in your favor
right away.”-

Men's lacrosse licks
its chops for Shootout

By Jerry Klayman
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s lacrosse
team will participate in and

. dually host the fifth-annual

Pittsburgh Lacrosse
Shootout Tournament.
Games will begin on Friday
at the Cost Center and at
Carnegie-Mellon University.
The Panthers have won this
tournament two out of the
last three years.

“This year’s tournament
will be the toughest ever, I
believe,” said head coach
Gary Neff. “The competi-
tion playing will be top-
notch.” The Panthers, who
have been a .500 team this
season, are considered to be
one of the favorites in this
27-game, three—day extrava-
ganza.

“We usually play very
well at this tournament,”

said sophomore attackman “

Pat Shea.

Playing at the Cost Center
is something that the
Panthers always take advan-
tage of. In fact, the Panthers
loss to the Pitt Lacrosse
Club on March 16 was their
only loss ever suffered
there.

“The lighting system at
the Cost Center is very dif-
ferent from that of any
lighting system that I have
ever seen,” Shea said.
“After playing there for a
while, we have become
accustomed to it. For play-
ers that are not used to it, it
can cause great distractions
when looking up for the
ball.

“Hopefully, a lot of people
will come and cheer us on.”

After losing many players I

from last year’s powerhouse
team to graduation, Pitt was
left with just three players
who have any game experi-
ence.

“Last year’s team was a
powerhouse,” said Neff.
“We were very experienced.
We had a lot of players that
had played for me for four
years. This team has a lot of
unity. We do not really have
anyone that can say, “You
give me the ball and I’ll
take care of the rest.’ We are
a very team-orientated team
this year. We play as a unit.
I have been pleasantly sur-
prised with the amount of

goals that o.ur offense has ,

‘scored. Our defense is the
strongest part of this team.”
Goaltending is a major

component to any lacrosse
team. With the team’s start-
ing. goaltender graduating,
the starting position was
wide open. Now, there are
two players that share the
duties. Division III transfer
Michael Stuckert and fresh-
man John McGrath have

been effective in manning .

the nets.

“We really have lucked
out in receiving Stuckert,”
said junior John Foris.
“Both John McGrath and
Stuckert have played well.”

The Panthers will face off
against Penn_State in their
opening match on Saturday
at 2 p.m.

“The opening game
against Penn State should be
a great battle,” said Neff. “If
people want to see a good
lacrosse game, this game
has presented the perfect
opportunitv.”

Elkins College no competition for

11

high-powered women '5 lacrosse

By Matt Townsend
For The Pitt News

Last Tuesday the women’s lacrosse team
took on an inexperienced Elkins College
team and soundly defeated it 10-3,
improving their record to 6-1.

Offensive standout Jodi Marcus scored a
hat trick to lead all scorers. Jodi Bowman
and Peggy Hanson each added two goals.

“Jodi can drive and score and can _carry
the offense when it isn’t working,”
defensemen Astrid Rapp said.

Elkins, which is in its first year of inter-
collegiate play, was no match for the
impressive teamwork of the Lady
Panthers. They outplayed Elkins in every
facet of_ the game.

“We played together and everyone was
working hard,” Marcus said.

In the opening minutes, Elkins took a 1-
0 lead on a quick shot off the face off. Pitt
countered with a penalty shot goal by Jen
Sheller, tying the game. Elkins again took
the lead 2-1 and kept it for most of the
first half. '

and I think that we played down to their
level in the first half,” Marcus said. “At
halftime we regrouped and played much
better in the second half.”

Pitt surged near the end of the first half,
scoring three straight goals to take a 4-2
lead into halftime.

The second half belonged to Pitt. Four
unanswered goals, two by both Bowman
and Marcus, made the score 8-2. While
the offense dominated the second half, the
defense stymied several of Elkins’ offen-
sive threats. It also ignited several fast
breaks. Goalie Jessica Strelitz made many
saves, allowing onlyone second—half
goaL

“Kathleen Kubicek, Jen Sheller -and
Stacy Plotnick played awesome on
defense today,” center Heather Dowdy
said. '

This deficit, too great for Elkins to
overcome, turned the game into a romp.
Peggy Hanson added her second goal to
make it 10-3 as the whistle sounded.

The team will end their home schedule
next Monday against Bethany College at 6
p.m. at the Cost Center.

to new heights, and he was soon being
looked at by colleges. The thought of get-
ting an inside look at universities ‘to col-
lect data intrigued Mike and his leader.
But he couldn’t ﬁgure out why these
Americans were making such a fuss about
a petty little game.

Mike decided to attend the major uni-
versity near his hometown. Mike exploded
onto the scene and dominated the college
ranks for three years. Mike’s leader, who
was following Mike’s progress, thought it
would be a good idea to go to the next
level and ﬁnd more out about this peculiar
game. ‘

So Mike went to the NBA, and again
dominated like no other player ever has.
The game was just too easy, and humans
were far too inferior to Mike’s skills. After

winning numerous NBA awards and titles,
Mike and his leader became bored, not to
mention he found out everything there
needs to be known about basketball.

Meanwhile, Mork was doing well for
himself, as well. His popularity blossomed
into an everyday sitcom, in which all he
had to do was act like himself. But after
four years, people got tired of Mork, and
his show was cancelled. Reruns survived
Mork until he too changed his name, but
that’s an entirely different story.

Mike, on the other hand, was known
around the world. Despite his immense
popularity, he quit basketball and decided
to try out another avenue of athletics —
baseball.

Mike didn’t fare well in baseball,
though, because it wasn’t basic Orkian
geometry. After sticking withkbaseball for

a year, Mike wanted to see if his basket-
ball skills were still sharp.

When Mike announced his return to
basketball, America itched with anticipa-
tion. However, there were thousands of
doubters saying that Mike couldn’t return
to his old shape because he was out of the
game too long and he was aging.

But what people don’t realize is Orkians
age backwards. In other words, as time
goes on, Orkians get younger. Case 
point: Mearth, Mork’s son. -.

So whoever thinks that Mike’s skills .
will be diminished, or he’ll embarrass
himself by coming back, keep in mind,
he’s not human. Plain and simple: Mike’s
an alien.

Prodigy

Mute

Music

I swear, in Europe, they
make their dance music in a
laboratory. I can just imagine
the little white laboratory rats
rhythmically scurrying around
their little control group cages,
to the laced tunes of the prodi-
gious Future Sounds of
London. I envy those damn
rats! Prodigy, yet another
group of British techno
savants, have convinced me

 that science and musicmake

pleasantly strange bed part-
ners. Their new album, Music
for the Jilted Generation, is
so good that I don’t even want
to listen to it. These guys are
the nerds of “trip-hop," and
when I grow up I wanna be
just like them.

First of all, do not listen to
this album unless you intend
on dancing your ass off. “No
one can eat just one" with this
album. When the music starts,
you have to move (God, I_
wish my dorm room was big-

-ger). This album invokes

every single emotion you can
imagine, from felicity to
straight-up exhaustion.
Prodigy has something for
everybody. “Voodoo People”
is a bewitching tune that starts
out disguised as one helluva
rock song with a speedy, pen-
dulum-swaying electric guitar,
and then it reveals itself with
trippy house hop drum beats
and sense-deceiving “voodoo"
samples. “Break and Enter" is
just splendid!!! The fairy-tale

' vocals give it a certain Iullabye

luster that buffers your aching
bones while allowing you to
continue moving to the infalli-
ble rhythm. “No Good" is simi-
lar, only faster. The combina-
tion of twisty tribal-driven
beats and repetitious lyrics
like “you’re no good for me/I
don't need nobody/don’t need
no one/that's no good for me"
boosts your self-esteem as
well as your heart rate.

Words can’t describe the
sounds comin-g from my
speakers when listening to
‘‘Full Throttle." All I can con-
clude is divine intervention.

I'm not exaggerating when I
say that this is the best dance
album that I have ever heard
(and I have heard a lot of
dance albums). You must
understand that Prodigy is
affiliated with electronic musi-
cal geniuses such as Front
242, Future Sounds of London
(who are God’s_ own personal,
live-in musicians), Euro
Dance, and Ministry, which
gives them one hell of an
advantage over their musical
contemporaries. “Their Law,"

an intimidatingly murky, indus-

 

trial ball of bliss features the
music of Pop Will Eat Itself!

Now, come on! How could '

they go wrong with this
album?

I dubbed and sent a copy of
Prodigy to my friend in
Virginia. When I last talked to

him, he said that he almost-

got into a car accident from
listening to “that damn tape.”

“You don’t like it?”, I asked,

“What are you talkin’ about”
he said “I love it!” All I know is
that, if they need any more
laboratory subjects for their
next album, this willing
American can supply her own
cage.

Thank You
Royal Trux
Virgin

Does anybody givea shit
that Royal Trux has a record
out on Virgin, let me clear my
throat, a major label?? I really
don’t know. I guess I could
pontificate on the ironies
involved. ‘I mean, it’s pretty
funny to think about the impli-
cations_of the name “Virgin"
and the slutty, smack aura
that radiates from Royal Trux.
Oh the history, the drugs,
Jennifer Herrema’s Bardot
pout and Haggerty's Keith
Richards fantasy  Did I men-
tion the drugs?? They seem to
overshadow the band. Sure
they were on heroin and you
were high when you first lis-
tened to “Junky Nurse” but

was there more to it than that? ‘

What seems so appealing
about Royal Trux to critics is
the notion of the “decadent
urban plight." Two middle
class white kids losing their
minds taking it one day at a
time, one drink at a time,
reminding the world that they
don’t care. This story has
been told before, the Velvet
Underground and the Stooges
helped spark off the punk
bohemia, and Royal Trux has
their place in this spectrum.

Unlike the distilled alterna- .

schlock-slightly neurotic, thrift-
store artists, they have got
some serious style and atti-
tude. It's about snarling “fuck
you” sex appeal — tight blue
jeans, and guts to do anything
you feel like. I guess an aloof,
genuinely disinterested look
and being a former member of
one hard-ass snotty punk
band, Pussy Galore, helps,
too.

It really comes down to
rockin’. and rollin’. That is what
Royal Trux is really about. I've
complained about a neo-roots
revival on MTV for a while.
Whether it's 703 fashion, the
Black Crowes, or Collective
Soul (what lasting powerl), the
end result is a weak version of
a formula that got really tired

by the ‘80s.
Go ahead, slur new wave, I
dare ya! Well Royal Trux and
many professional garage
bands forget the pretention
and just wall. The music may
be reminiscent of the decades
past, but look ma, no endless
masturbatory guitar solos!
Royal Trux’s music doesn’t
faI|'into the punk doldrum
“one, two, three Ramones”
thing, but simply jams on
some chords and riffs forget-
ting the tension and adoles-
cence of hardcore. Grooving is
a good thing, but like the punk.
ethos, if you can’t play sober
or well in a classical sense, it
won't sound like stinkin’
Clapton! Thank god it doesn’t.
Don't get me wrong, I think
Haggerty is an amazing gui-
tarist-listen to the Dogs of
Love U.K ep. There is every-
one from Hendrix, Richards
and Cropper in there. The
point is that until the new

album, the shit was loose.

 

    

Real loose._And oh, how good
it felt.

Thank You, is the name the
major label debut. Digression:
It's also the new Duran Duran
album, an album in which they
cover “911’s a Joke" by P.E.
Yikesl Anyway, the Trux
album is not the same trip
you’re used to: it’s TIGHT.
Yeah, it’s still fueled by Teen

Pussy Power, but it’s tight. I V

attribute this mainly to the fact
that the two have assembled a
full-time band. Let’s see,
there's Dan on bass and Chris
and Rob on drums, and the
sound sure is fat. The record
also sounds pretty comfort-
able. The players work well
with each other, and everyone
seems to relax into solid rock
bliss. '

This record does notsound
comfortable in the way your
ratty tennis shoes feel, ‘though.
It is immaculately produced —
the sound qua_Iity is pristine.
What the hell would you“

expect from Virgin anyway?
They may have been drunk
when they signed the band,
but they surely sobered up
and would never compromise
fidelity, even‘ if it’s marketable.
Even record company weasels
have standards. The clean-
s_ounding recording takes
away some of the edge, but it

is nice to hear Haggerty's killer
guitar tone without static, or

poorly equalized. The drums
sound pretty natural — not too
big, not non-existent in the mix

— and the vocals are up front

but not understandable. For a
hard rockin’ album in the vein
of Alice Cooper or the

Yardbirds, this is a great

approach.
The music itself can be
described with a word: Boogie.

From the fastest and hardest

song to the most subdued,
Royal Trux manges to fry up
some funk that keeps you
shakin’ and shimmyin’.

When trying to explain
three collaborators’ extension
of artistic boundaries that
defy definition, it’s necessary
to provide a little visualiza-
tion. g
Example: Have you ever
felt like you wanted to take
some wild elective, so far
from your major that, you
need a road map, but you
persist in registering because
your friends keep telling you
that the class is a blast? ‘
That's close to the vision
Jeanne Pearlman, executive
director of the Three Rivers
Arts Festival; Carolelinda
Dickey, executive director of
Pittsburgh Dance Council
and Marc Masterson, produc-
ing director of City Theater
had in mind when they orga-
nized What's Left?, an eclec-
tic collection of nationally
renowned performance art
set in a local milieu.

These three leaders of the

arts in the ‘burgh attempt to
break down the traditional
definitive barriers of perfor-
mance art with this series.

. “As contemporary artists con-

tinue to challenge the exist-
ing boundaries between dis-
ciplines, it is essential for pre-
senters to follow their lead
and ask, ‘If it’s, not visualar_ts
and it’s not theater, and it’s
not dance, then what's Ieft?,’_”
says Jeanne Pearlman,
explaining the appropriate
title.

A cavalcade .of comedy, _

movement’ and music
includes The Wizard of Hip...
(or When In Doubt Slam
Dunk), a moving perfor-

"mance autobiography dealing -

with the advent of the AIDS
crisis, performance poetry,
and, how else do you
describe her, the entertaining
Kate Clinton. According to
Dickey, th_e'artists which
were selected for this series
are there because “each of
them uses their political point
of view to drive the focus of
their work." (O.K., explain
Squonk Opera.)

One of the acts that stood
out in the line-up is the com-
munity-based II Drink
Televised Gods, presented
by The Hittite Empire and

American men. The group

The Pittsburgh Ensemble. it's
comprised of musi,c/move-
ment/ poetry/storytelling used
to expose the media-inspired
image of young African-

has traditionally tried to pro-
vide mentors for youth in the
African-American community
and to provide them with a"
sense of hope.

All of the performers were
chosen to expose their
respective art form to an
audience that might not oth-
erwise be exposed to it. The
different cultures and person-
ified beliefs that they repre-
sent work to bring under-
standing to powerful issues.
Political ‘correctness having
been thrown out the window,
this is a deliciously irreverent
series where an audience
can gain insight-into anoth-
er’s struggle from a personal
vantage point. A series like
this can prove most effective
in bringing radical perfor-
mance art to our community.

The patrons of this ground-
breaking series may pose the
question, “What’s Left?,_” but
I'd like to ask “What’s next?" I

Studying at Temple, Paul
Turgeon knew that if heever
had a band to compliment the
lyrics he constantly scrawled
into his notebook, he wanted
their name to have universal
appeal. A name that would cut
across everything. So being a
student of film he decided
upon “The Movies.”

Cut to last year. Divine inter-
vention and relatives have
brought Turgeon to Pittsburgh,
where he hooks up with veter-
ans of the Pittsburgh scene,
drummer Skip Garvin'and
bass player Mark Zielin

‘ (among others bands, both put

in time with Brownie Mary.)
Hell, Zielin was even in Let's
Kill Larry, who opened up a
show for Nirvana back in 1990.

Turgeon picked up a guitar,
had a few lessons then went
into the studio with Skip and
Mark to record Geeks and
Gods, (Paul isn’t kidding in
“Flock Star” when he sings “No

, one knows last year I only

knew three chords.”) After
hearing the band a few times,
guitarist Bill Baine asked if he
could join. “I have a hard time

asking a girl out,” con-
fessed Baine. “But I
asked to join the band.”
The Movies, who weren’t
looking for anyone, still
said yes. “With Bill we
have a lot more potential
as a live band and in the
studio,” said Turgeon.
Geeks and Gods, at
the least, has an eclectic
sound, at the most is a
great tape. The sound is
destined to make a large
dent on the local scene
and hopefully on a

. national scale as well. The

members combine jangly gui-
tar, deep funk bass lines and
drums that deviate from the
stale bass, snare, highhat
combinations. Influences
range from early Police and
Steely Dan to Fishbone and
Primus and even ‘80's groups
like Men at Work. Coming from
Pittsburgh, Skip of course lis-
tens mainly to Classic Flock
and a little Blues. _

The lyrics are a-perfect com-
pliment to the left-of-center
sound the band puts out.
“They say I’m evil but I ain't/I
got three kids

overseas/Named my cat but
then she died/Looked out the
window at my beach/Soul as

empty as my sky,” (from\

“Route 666”.) “The song’s
about fearing success,” offers
Turgeon. “You can name your
kid, but naming and owning
and loving are different things.”
“Cat of Cincinnati” seems to
stand out most on the tape. |t’s
sentimentality is heard in lyrics
like, ‘‘I watch you from atower
window/Making sure you’re
still around/‘Cos I depend on
your affections/As my defens-
es spiral down.” They almost
didn’t put the song on the tape.

The Movies play an all-ages acousic show t Java J s  ril 5th.

“But we thought it was an
anomaly, and decided as a
band to leave it on,” explained
Turgeon.

In a very unpretentious fash-
ion, The Movies had a cas-
sette release party last
Wednesday at Graffiti, as

release party, (O.K. lack of
funds may have played a.littIe
role in this.) “We’ve always
been a do it yourself band,”

- said Zielin. “We didn’t want to

wait for anyone else to do it,
we wanted to get the tape out.”
It’s this same “do it ourselves”
attitude that got The Movies a

  Sex, Drugs

and Democracy director Jonathan Blank

I   I am writing to comment on the controversy surrounding the printer's

refusal to print certain stills from my film, ”Sex, Drugs 8: Democracy” for your

- newspaper.
as a u ’ It is indeed ironic that a ﬁlm on freedom would itself become the victim of
censorship. For those who haven't seen it, ”Sex, Drugs 8: Democracy” is a docu-

mentary film which takes an uncensored look at morality and politics in

Holland today. It is worth noting that one can regularly see any of the offending
I images from my ﬁlm —— or even much more graphic images —— in Dutch :_news-

papers and on Dutch television. But as one critic put it, ”The film challenges
Americans to examine their freedoms and limitations."

ety allows more individual freedom, it also promotes greater personal responsi-
bility. Here are a few examples:

1.) The Dutch have thriving sex and drug industries, but guns are extremely
rare and they have the lowest imprisonment rate in the world.

2.) All abortions are paid for by the government, yet they have the lowest
abortion rate in the world.

3.) Sex education and contraceptives distribution are part of children's school
curriculum, and they have the lowest teenage pregnancy rate in the world.

4.) Heroin is readily available and the government distributes syringes, but
there are only 20,000 heroin addicts in a population of 16 million (a rate lower
than Singapore's). ‘

' 5.) Marijuana is openly sold in thousands of ”coffeeshops,” but there is only a
3 percent rate of marijuana use in youth under 19.
6.) Though they have open prostitution and pornography, the Dutch have
I low rates of STDs, AIDS and violent crime toward women, and the number of
women going to work in prostitution is low and stable.

ity. Over one-third of our world's largest prison population (and over 60 percent
of federal prisoners) are incarcerated for drug-war related crimes. Abortion is a
lightning rod issue, while the fact that the United States has one of the highest
rates of infant morality in the western world is rarely mentioned Addicts are

Politicians speak of a crisis in ”family values” while failing to assist families
with health care or child care and slashing budgets for schools, museums,
libraries and parks. Welfare is viliﬁed while prisons (the ultimate form of wel-
fare) are lauded. Abstinence is taught to teenagers as a form of sex-education It
seems that as a society, we can only generate consensus on punitive reactions to
social problems, while we are consistently incapable of any efforts which can be
taken to improve society.

Clearly, the Dutch have several factorsin their favor including a century's
long history of tolerance, a small, manageable country, and a relatively homoge-

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

NOW PRACTICIN G DISCRIMINATION

AGAINST SOME BUSINESSES IN
OAKLAND...

The University of Pittsburgh is state and federally
subsidized, and is now practicing discrimination. The
Original Hot Dog Shop has applied for choice dollars and has
been denied- The Original Hot Dog Shop is the oldest
restaurant in Oakland, having been there forl36 years.
Recently a new restaurant was opened, and they were given
choice dollars right away. The party that owns the restaurant
includes a member of city council. Does that tell you
anything? The Original Hot Dog Shop is a landmark in the
city of Pittsburgh. We have complied with all rules and
regulations and we have still been denied choice dollars. We
appeal our caseto students, doctors, the board directors, and .
the professors «of the University of Pittsburgh. Question:
What do the University of Pittsburgh law students think of  

this one?...

compilation proves two t rngs.
1) Despite becoming forever
associated with the pompous,
pretentious “arena rock” genre
of the 1970s, Led Zeppelin’s
music is among the most pow-
erful, diverse andcomplex in
the history of rock ‘n’ roll, and
2) it’s really easy for a. band to
screw up a good Zep song if
they don’t know what the hell
they’re doing.

Honey-voiced Darius Rucker
and Hootie and the Blowfish
knew exactly what they were
doing with their masterful
cover of “Hey Hey What Can I
Do,” an acoustic tune whose
bluesy feel fits in perfectly with
the bar-band sound that has
made the Hooties so popular
over the past year. Rucker’s
voice is smoother than a
baby’s bottom, and Mark
Bryan’s acoustic strumming
would make Jimmy Page him-
self proud. With guest Peter
Holsapple (of the seminal
Athens, Ga., band the dBs) fill-
ing in on the mandolin,
Zeppelin itself couldn’t have
done a whole lot better (even
now that they’re Unleddedl).
This may be one of the best
covers of any song since Patti

Smith remade Bru_ce
Springsteen’s “Because the
Night.”

Cracker and Big Head Todd
and the Monsters show their
classic rock side by doing solid
covers of “Good Times, Bad
Times” and “Tangerine,”
respectively. “Good Times”
includes some of guitarist
Johnny Hickman’s best work
to date, and “Tangerine” even
comes with some pedal-steel
guitar in the background,
which fits the song’s sentimen-
tal mood perfectly. I '

4 Non Blondes’ choice of
songs makes a lot of sense.
Their version of the_Zep oldie
“Misty Mountain Hop” allows
singer Linda Perry to once

"again show off her volcanic

pipes and her ability to_flow
between singing loud and soft
(which she first demonstrated
a couple years back with the
painfully catchy “What’s Up”).
And Stone Temple Pilots’
acoustic rendering of “Dancing
Days” shows STP can do a
good job covering someone
other than Pearl Jam.

Half the fun of Encomium is
checking out the bands you’d
never expect to hear covering
old Zep tunes. Helmet teams
up with Jesus Lizard’s David
Yow (what a pair there) to
revamp “Custard .Pie.” Little-
known duo Never the Bride,
featuring scratchy-voiced
singer Nikki Lamborn, reworks
Zep’s worn-out acoustic piece
“Going to California” into a
stately piano ballad.

But the Rollins Band’s
pounding cover of “Four
Sticks” might top them all.
Although the song, from Zep’s
fourth album, was written 24
years, ago, it seems tailor-
made for‘Chris Haskett’s blis-
tering guitar work and Henry
Rollins’ incessant hollering. it’s
almost scary to hear Rollins
belt out lyrics like “how do you
feel/when you live in your mind

March 30 1995

and think that it’s real  oh,
baby, you’re killin’ me/oh,
baby, you’re all I see,” knowing
that he didn’t write them him-
self. (But what do I know  I‘m
a L|ARll!)

Keeping with his current
theme of reworking and revis-
ing old tunes, Robert Plant
teams up with Tori Amos for a
majestic, subdued version ot
“Down By the Seaside.” The
album’s closing track, which
clocks in at just under eight
minutes, shows that Plant still
does have a voice, as long as
he doesn’t try to sing too loud.
As usual, Amos sounds like
she’s writhing" in pain (or hav-
ing one hell of a good
orgasm). This, along with the
addition of a piano, adds an
eerie touch to the old Physica.
Graffiti standard.

Of course, for all the really
good offerings on this 12-song
disc, there are just as many
pieces of utter crap. in his
lethargic version of the mellow
Zep ballad “Thank You,” Duran
Duran’s Simon LeBon shows

"just how far his band has fallen

since its mid—’80s heyday. And
Blind Melon’s whiny Shannon
Hoon, who should have "quit
the music biz after doing back-
up vocals for Guns ‘N Roses a
few years back, couldn’t have
done a more annoying job 01
rendering “Out on the Tiles.”
Plant may have never had
the most melodic, soothing
voice (check out The Song
Remains the Same on video
and you’ll know what l mean),
but people like LeBon, who
seems to have lost his ability
to carry a tune, and Hoon, who
never could sing at all, have

no business mangling pieces’

of rock ‘n’ roll history.

And what the hell is Sheryl
Crow doing fooling around with
“D’yer Mak’er,” one of the few
Zep songs that hasn’t fallen
prey to the jaws of classic rock
radio overkill? When Plant

sang “whoa oh oh oh oh, you‘

don’t have to go oh oh oh oh
 he was doing a prettycool
tongue-in-cheek takeoff on
19703 reggae clichés. When

Crow sings it, it sounds like '

she’s constipated. She really

should stick to her cheesy.

pop/folk tunes — at least that
way, we don’t have to know
how bad her voice really is.
Led Zeppelin’s trademark
mix of Mississippi Delta blues,
European folk, Eastern mysti-
cism and traditional hard «rock
made the group one of the
most influential bands of its
time. It's fine for the Hooties,
STP and Big Head Todd, who
were shaped to some degree
by music from the “classic
rock” period, to remake old
Zep standards. However,
hearing Sheryl Crow and the
washed-up Duran Duran fuck
up great Zeppelin songs in the
name of money and more

exposure is a downright dis-A

grace. —
Apparently, over-commer-

cialized rock ‘n’crol| didn’t die‘

with the ‘80s. I guess the song
remains the same, after all.
