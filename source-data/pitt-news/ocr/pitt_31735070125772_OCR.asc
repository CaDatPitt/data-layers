Taliban’s foes Se U.S. oost

BAGRAM, Afghanistan —- On the
front line in Afghanistan’s draining civil
war, 22 miles from the capital, Kabul, slight,
silent boys armed with Kalashnikovs stare
across a pockmarked village of deserted
mud houses at the Taliban positions.

The Afghan opposition, having suf-
fered defeat after defeat at the hands of the
Taliban, suddenly is ﬁred with hope. Their
savior, they believe, will be the United
States. » .
With the Taliban government that took
over Afghanistan ﬁve years ago emerging as
a key target in President Bush’s battle
against terrorism, the opposition ﬁghters of
the Northern Alliance are hoping the United
States can bring down the enemy they failed
to defeat.

The deputy commander at the Bagram
military air base, Col. Malang, who like
many Afghans goes by one name, acknowl-
edged ﬂiat there is no chance of defeating

‘ the Taliban and taldng the capital — unless

Washington, D.C., helps.
“We can go on ﬁghting for a long time,

I but America must destroy the terrorists,” he

said. “If the Americans want to destroy

them, we are ready to go to Kab .”

VV1th Afghanistan singled out as a target
for offering shelter to Osama bin Laden, the
man accused by U.S. officials of master-
minding the terrorist attacks on New York
and the Pentagon, the world’s attention has
tumed to the ragged Afghan ﬁghters who
have been at war with the Taliban move-
ment since it emerged in 1994.

In the front-line dugouts, a young oppo-

_ sition soldier stands dwarfed by his huge

Sororities welcome new bids

REBECCA HUDOCK
‘ Staff Writer

As 8 p.m. rolled around in the
William Pitt’ Union last night, groups
of women paced the lobby smoothing
their hair and checking their makeup.

The women gathered outside the.

Union with mounting enthusiasm for
the time that will determine the fate
of all women who rushed a sorority:
Bid Night.

The process of introducing stu-
dents into Greek culture begins-with
Meet the Greeks, held Sept. 10, dur-
ing which students interested in join-
ing a sorority or fraternity can intro-

' duce themselves to the numerous

chapters.

But the first night can overwhelm.

prospective members, so the week
following Sept. 20 was designed to
better acquaint men and women with
the variousgroups. '

“We went from visiting 11 soror-
ities the -first night to finally two at
the end,” 'freshIIl.aI1 Chelsea Kohl
said. “Sunday and Monday were the
most helpful tohelp narrow down the
choices-because we-fgot to spend the
most tir_-iniegwith the sisters and hear
what they had to say about sister-
hood and what it meant to them.”

But sorority rush was not always
as structured as it is now. Four or
five years ago, as part of a national
test program, women were permitted
to visit as many or as few houses as
they wanted to, but during the test
period fewer women expressed an
interest in pledging. ’

“We chose to go to a more for-
malized rush after Pitt sororities lost
a chapter and overall numbers
declined,” said Meghan Fetzer, inter-
nal vice president of Panhellenic
Association.

Today’s sorority rush operates
under a recommendation from the
national office, which requires all
prospective sisters to meet with ‘each
house. Later, at their discretion the
women may visit eight, five and
finally two houses.

Bid Night is the first time sorori-
ties can verbalize interest in new
members, and emotions ran high.

“We’re really nervous for the‘

girls on Bid Night, too,” said Jessica
Riester, a Kappa Kappa Gamma
senior. “It’s not fun watching some-
one get a ‘rejection from a house that
they really want.”

Before Bid Night, sororities and
their. members are not permitted’ to
tell a woman that they are interested

7

    

in having her as a sister.
“Telling someone [who’s] rush-
ing that as a sorority house -you are

interested in them as a new member '

is‘ known as dirty rushing, and it’s
illegal for both sororities and frater-
nities,” Fetzer said.

Following Bid Night sororities
can take part in continuous open bid-
ding, which allows each chapter on a
house-by-house basis to make offers

to other potential members if that

house has not reached quota. -

But as sororities follow a regi-
mented schedule, fraternities on
Pitt’s campus follow a more loosely
structured rush. B

Unlike their female counterparts,
men are not required to meet with a
pre-selected number of chapters.

Nor is their Bid Night surround-
ed. with the pomp and circumstance
of sorority Bid Night. ’

Sigma Alpha Epsilon brother
Ryan McMichael said that generally
fraternities meet with prospective
members on a one-on-one basis.

“Sometimes we’ll go ‘up torhim
after one of the rush events following
Bid Night or a few brothers will go
to their apartment to see if they
express any interest,” McMichael
said.

Pitt to offer new master’s
certificate for engineers

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Digital
Greenhouse and several faculty mem-
bers from the electrical engineering
department got together yesterday for
a kickoff luncheon geared toward pur-
suing interests in the electrical engi-
neering field. 2 ’

The Pittsburgh ' Digital
Greenhouse is a state-sponsored, non-
proﬁt organization that aims ‘to keep
young people in the Pittsburgh area by
providing job opportunities to students
interested in a career in electrical engi-
neering._

In an effort to provide young pro-
fessionals with a reason to stay in the
area, Pittsburgh‘ Digital Greenhouse
created the System-on-a-Chip, also
known as SoC, master’s certiﬁcate
program. .

Dennis Yablonsky, president and
CEO of ‘the Pittsburgh Digital
Greenhouse, and Joel Falk, professor
and chairman of Pitt’s department of
electrical engineering, worked togeth-
er to establish this master’s degree in
electrical engineering with the SoC
certificate course work and design
projects.

SoC is a computer chip that is
wearable and uses less than two watts
of power as it transmits facts, ﬁgures
and data at the speed of light.

“Today I can carry around a chip

, that contains what five years ago
« would have been an entire ﬁle cabinet
; full of bulky computer equipment,”
_T said Dr. Dave Landis, vice president of
.. education and training for the
' Pittsburgh Digital Greenhouse.

“We picked the System-on-a-Chip

6 design because it’s our economic
. development project,” he said. “If you
' open your laptop computer ‘you’ll see

a bunch of chips. We imagine that in a

I M few years it will all be on one chip.”

“SoC‘has everything that a com-

‘ puter has and needs, but it is just
A scaled down to a smaller size,” said
. junior Heather Greco, Pitt’s university
.: ambassador to the Pittsburgh Digital
" Greenhouse. ‘

The SoC certificate program will

_ be offered this spring by the electrical

engineering department at Pitt. This

' certiﬁcate program is the only one
available in the country and is offered '

by Pitt, Carnegie Mellon University
and Penn State University. About a
year ago, the three schools formed a

a task force to come up with a plan for

this venture.

Students from any one of the three"

member schools may take courses at

the other schools offering the program.

Thirty credits are required for this
degree and the only prerequisite is a
bachelor’s degree in electrical engi-
neering.

“Our role is to create jobs in and
around the Pittsburgh area and to bet-
ter educate students in all three
schools,” Landis said.

By offering this program to three
different schools, students get the
chance to meet and work- with and
learn from other students in the same

Pitt professor, protagonist
reads from his new book

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
The Pitt News

Pitt writing professor Chuck
Kinder is rumored to be the title char-
acter in a best—selling novel, and now
he’s written a novel in which another
author may be the protagonist.

_In a book signing at the Squirrel ,

Hill Barnes and Noble book store,
Kinderread excerpts from his new
novel, “Honeymooners: A Cautionary
Tale,” which has garnered national
attention not only for its artistic merit
but also for the controversy surround-
ing it as a possible true story of the
life of famed author Ray Carver, who
was a close friend of Kinder’s.

“Honeymooners,” which was
called “a postmodern experiment in
the blurring of fact and fiction” in a
review by The New York Times in
July, carries with it the expectations
of more than 20 years of develop-
ment.

Kinder, who is said to be the
inspiration for the character Grady
Tripp in Michael Chabon’s novel
“Wonderboys,” had not released a
novel since 1978’s “The Silver
Ghost.”

Those in attendance did not have
to wait long for the questions to sur-
face. After thanking everyone for
coming out and offering jokingly to
“buy everyone drinks somewhere”
afterward, Kinder introduced his
reading by talking about the role of a
roman a clef or thinly-veiled retelling

of actual events, and the responses to ’

his latest work.

“My book has been called a
roman a clef,” Kinder said. “That
could be the case, but still this book is
essentially a work of imagination.”

Kinder entertained the crowd with
a s_tory of an old friend, “Buffalo

Bill,” who will no longer talk to him
because of a character in the book
named Bill whose portrayal “dented
his dignity.” Kinder then read an
excerpt about Bill’s ‘character, a
drunken country music fan who
leaves his wife for a new life in San
Francisco.‘ °

“People do read this a little too
literally, perhaps,” he said. “You have
to draw on your life experiences to
write, I think.”

Kinder followed that reading with
other short excerpts, including a
monologue by Bill’s wife in which
Kinder told the audience to visualize
him as the character in order to
achieve the full effect.-

“Remember,” Kinder said, “I’Ve
got long blonde hair and I’m beauti-
ful.”

After the reading, a short ques-
tion—and-answer session followed. An
audience member said that he had
read that the character of Ralph was
basedon Carver.

“It’s a work of fiction,” Kinder /

responded.

The book signing was planned for
months

“We talked about it in June,” said
Carol Barta, community relations
manager at Barnes and Noble.

Monday night’s‘ inclement weath-
er did not deter the audience, about 20
friends and fans of Kinder. .'

“Sometimes [attendance] ﬂuctu-
ates,” Barta said, “but this is a nice
turnout.”

Barnes and Noble regularly hosts

readings and book signings, and other _

Pitt professors will appear there
throughout the season, according to
Barta. _
A “I think»we’,re really fortunate to
have a literary community around
here,” she said.

“Anything extra that can make you
stand out as a student will make a dif-
ference in the long run,” Greco said.
The ' Pittsburgh Digital
Greenhouse presented this program at

Pitt yesterday, and will showcase it at

CMU next week and at Penn State in
two weeks. Once the word is out, the
group will work with the three schools
on combining efforts to make the pro-
gram take off.

“At Pitt there are more than 1,000

4-

students enrolled in electrical" engi-

neering and computer engineering, yet ..

more than 60 percent leave the
Pittsburgh area because they believe
that there aren’t any - job opportuni-
ties,” Landis said.

“Students should consider this
program because it’s a great experi-
ence that will allow them to take
advantage of three great schools,”
Greco said. “Students can get a hands-
on experience designing a silicon chip

graduate student without this pro-

The new Pentagon pays off in saved lives  

STEVE VOGEL
The Washington Post

Blackened cables dangled from the
Pentagon ceiling like jungle vines.
Windows were shattered, some by the blast,
others by ﬁreﬁghters battling the blaze.
Walls were greasy with soot and covered
with markings scribbled by ﬁreﬁghters and
FBI agents showing what rooms had been
searched for evidence and bodies. _

Conference rooms, spanking new two
weeks ago, sat festering with mold caused
by water damage so bad that someareas
have been quarantined until they can be
cleaned.

In some rooms, it was as if time had
stopped. Neatly arranged on the coffee
table in one Navy ofﬁce was a soot—covered
newspaper from Tuesday, Sept. 11.

“Life’s changed a lot since then,” Lee
Evey noted ruefully.

Evey, the man responsible for renovat-
ing —— and now rebuilding — the Pentagon,
was cataloguing the work that lay ahead as

. he explored the corridors damaged in a ter-

rorist attack

When the hijacked jet crashed into the
building’s west face, claiming what is
feared to be 189 lives, it managed a direct
hit on‘ an area where work crews were just

ﬁnishing a three—year, $258 million renova-

tron.
“It’s all shot now,” said Evey, a pro-
gram manager who served as an Army

_ infantry ofﬁcer in Vietnam.

, Still, his dismay at having to start from
scratch is tempered by his conviction that

die renovations — particularly the expen-

sive structural reinforcements — helped
contain the damage and save lives.

After all, the terrorists’ weapon of
choice —- an airliner loaded with jet fuel -

. toppled the lofty towers of the World Trade
Center but left the squat Pentagon largely

intact. ,Workers were back in many ofﬁces
the next day, and two-thirds of the Pentagon

' is now deemed usable. ‘ ‘

“You have emotions on opposite ends
of the spectrum,” Evey said during a tour
inside some damaged sections last week

Do you have
asthma?

UPMC HEALTH SYSTEM

BILL O.’LEARY/THE WASHINGTON Posr

Renovation chief Lee Evey and Tom F ontana check out the water and soot dam-
age in a new cafeteria on the Pentagon’s first floor.

with The Washington Post, the ﬁrst provid-
ed to any news organization. ‘This is four
years out of my life, and a lot of other peo-
ple’s lives. But on the other hand, it worked
like it was supposed to and saved lives, and
that makes you feel good.”

As he spoke, industrial fans were hum-
ming in hallways, trying to blow out the
smell of smoke hanging in the air. Workers
in hard hats, some wearing surgical masks,
moved down corridors, visible only by the
ﬂashlights they held. ,

‘This is what I think is remarkable,”

Evey said, gesturing to a blackened object
in the corridor. “Look at this glass display
case. It’s not cracked.” ‘
Even more remarkable was what hap-
pened to many workerswhose-oﬂices sat

above or within what is now a gaping hole.

The structure held and did not collapse
for about 30 to 35 minutes, giving those
workerstime to escape. ‘-‘People in those
offices all got out,” he said. '

‘ Evey attributed much of that to struc-
tural safety upgrades that came with the
renovation project.

 

Blast—resistant windows —- $10,000
apiece — were installed. Steel framing
added support to concrete walls. Kevlar
cloth was applied between steel beams to

catch fragments in the event of an explo-

sion.

“None of that stuff is inexpensive, and
normally, you put it in, and nobody sees any
beneﬁt whatsoever,” Evey said.
“Unfortunately, in this instance, you got a
payback in an instant. The plane hit it, and
the taxpayers got their money’s worth in a
fraction of a second.”

When he first studied detailed pho-
tographs of the collapsed section of the
building, Evey thought it looked incompre-
hensible, as if someone had dumped a puz-
zle atop a table. But the more he looked, the
more he saw rhyme and a reason.

Maroon bands visible in photos were
six-inch by six-inch steel beams bolted
together ﬂoor by ﬂoor. They were still hold-
ing large portions of the collapsed structure
together.

In recent days, Evey said, his office has
been ﬂooded by e—mails from Pentagon
workers, some of whom escaped from
ofﬁces where the hole now stands and
wanted to say thank you.

“I’ve had more hugs in the last week
than in the last three years,” said Frank
Probst, a renovation ofﬁcial.

The worst-darnaged areas are still a
crime scene, with recovery of remains con-
tinuing. But even some of the lesser-dam-
aged areas, which Evey controls, have seri-
ous problems.

In some areas, the soot damage is
intense, greasy to the touch. “It’s as if you
spray-painted everything black,” Evey said.

Even worse is the water damage.

Evey opened the door to a brand-new
Navy conference room and was greeted by
an overpowering musty smell. Water came
in through doors, and in the warm, stagnant
air, mold was growing up through walls
and onto leather chairs.

.“A lot of this we’ll_ just smash down,”
he said.

canisters of water, slung on a pole across her

The poverty and deprivation is most
striking in the refugee camps, where people
who ﬂed the Taliban’s advance have been
stranded, often for three or more years —
long enough to have dug their tents into the
ground and built low stone fences around
them. A

The country is littered with the twisted
junk of successive wars. Every hundred or
so yards along the Panjshir River sit the
hulks of rusty tanks from the 1979-89 war
with the Soviet Union, which, aided by the

’ United States, the Afghan ﬁghters won.

Plane ruins
Pentagon
renovations

_ Pentagon, page 5

Fireﬁghters had broken down the door
to a nearby room ﬁlledwith brand-new
ﬁber’-optic telecommunications equipment.
It will all be pulled out and replaced
because of smoke damage.

The plane hit Wedge 1, but on a diag-
onal route that took it into the unrenovated
Wedge 2. While some parts of Wedge 1
were destroyed, signiﬁcant damage
extends much farther in Wedge 2, which,
unlike the renovated section, had no ﬁre
sprinklers. ‘The ﬁre just took off,” Evey

. said.

Workers are putting up construction
walls that will allow employees to contin-
ue working in undamaged portions of
Wedges 1 and 2 while repairs are under-
way. _

Since the attack, Pentagon oﬂicials
have leased 800,000 square feet for
employees from the damaged areas, on top
of the nearly one million square feet of
work space already leased for employees
displaced by renovation. The Pentagon has
already put out contracts for much of the
repair work “Contrary to popular opinion,
the American government can work quick-

ly when necessary, even us old bureau- ‘

crats,” Evey said.

Experts on blast and structure analysis
.—_ some of whom worked on previous
attacks such as Oklahoma- City — are
being brought in to “tell what happened to
thisbuilding, why it happened, how to best
rebuild,” Evey said. ’

The current design, which places "the
secretary of defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff
and many other high-ranking ofﬁcials in
the outer E Ring oiﬁces, some with nice

window views, doubtlessly will be_

rethought.

“We’re looking at all kinds of things in.

terms of lessons learn ” Evey said.
‘There are common-sense things we want
to look at.”

Before the attack, the renovation was
expected to be completed about 2012, a
time ﬁame Evey said is still valid. “It’s our
expectation now we’ll still be able to make
up that time and get this done on schedule,”

p he said. ' A

Evey kept ﬁnding bright spots on his
tour. He walked around a cafeteria —— so
new it had not even opened — crunching
shattered glass scattered all over the ﬂoor.
Someone had written in the soot in the
salad bar: “We will build anew.”

_ Evey gazed up at the skylight, a fea-
ture] he had been particularly proud of.
“Isn’t that amazing?” he said. “It’s not even
crack .”

Afghanistan suffers under Taliban

Taliban, page 6

There has been no such attack from
Bagram, but the Northern Alliance com-
mander at the military air base here,
Hawani, 27, said his men are ready.

War has so tattered Afghanistan that it
is diﬁicult to conceive how the place might
look if another one rages across the territo-

ry.

Millions of people have ﬂed their
homes. The country has been stricken by
drought, which has intemational relief agen-
cies warning of a humanitarian catastrophe,
particularly if thousands more people are
displaced by war.

The Northern Alliance is a motley col-
lection of former Communists, anti-
Communists and moderate Muslims,
whose numbers range from 15,000 to
30,000, depending on who is counting. It
gets assistance from countries including
Russia and Iran, and controls about 5 per-
cent of the cormtry.

The Taliban, made up mostly of ethnic
Pushttms who have imposed a strict form of
Islamic rule on the country, is believed to
have about 50,000 ﬁghters, as well as for-
eign assistance that makes it impossible to
defeat, Malang said.

Malang and other Northem Alliance
ﬁghters were wary of what might happen

should U.S. military intervention succeed in
deposing the Taliban.

Having lived through 10 years of
Soviet occupation, many are concerned
about whether a U.S. ground force might
move in, oust the Taliban, but fail to depart
quickly.

VV1thout being speciﬁc, Malang said the
Northem Alliance would be supportive if
the Americans installed a “good” govern-
ment. But asked how he would feel if
American forces occupied the cormtry for a
prolonged period, he and others answered
vaguely.

“We just want the Americans to destroy
the terro ' ” was all he would say.

Guns don’t mean safe ﬂights

Have you complained about having to ~

show up at the airport an hour before your
ﬂight?

Have you asked how the hijackers that
attacked New York and Washington could
get on the planes?

In the United States, airports and air-
lines themselves are responsible for security.
But they have to meet a bottom line. They
also want to keep their passengers satisﬁed —
which includes delaying them as little as
possible.

Airport security guards are often poorly
trained and poorly paid.

Following the Sept. 11 attacks, the
Federal Aviation Administration ordered
heightened security. Guards are on higher
alert, and passengers must show up two
horns before ﬂights.

But this is not enough The federal gov— _

emrnent should take over airport security
immediately. Guards must be better trained
and better paid They should also more strict-
ly enforce already existing regulations con-
cerning what a passenger can cany.

But increasing security on the ground is
not the only way to prevent future hijack-
mgs.
On Tuesday, the Air Line Pilots
Association announced that it will lobby for
legislation allowing pilots to carry guns, st11n
guns and other weapons in the cockpit. The
Justice Dept. has already placed federal air
marshals on some ﬂights.

Although the idea of air marshals and
pilots armed with guns might be comforting,
it could cause more harm than good.
Imagine a hijacker holding a person hostage,
threatening to slit her throat unless the air
marshal drops his gun. What would the air
marshal do?

What would happen if a bullet misses
its target and causes damage to the plane?

Training pilots and air marshals in areas
like martial arts and other forms of weapon-
less self—defense should be done. But they
should not carry guns. V

Another proposal is to strengthen cock-.
pit doors and lock them throughout the

ﬂight. The pilots would_ lock the doors, with _

no one else able to open them. Hijackings
would become more diﬂicult since a pilot
could just immediately land The hijacker
could not ﬂy it into a building.

Since terrorists would need a bomb
strong enough to cause other damage to the
plane to access the cockpit, this would ren-
der the hijacking pointless. ,

VV1th the more stringent security mea-
sures already in place here and in foreign air-
ports with planes leaving for the United

States,ﬂyingissaferthanintherecentpast..

People should not be overly paranoid.

Let’s justhope that those who complain
abouthavingtobeattheairportearlywill
ﬁnally realize that those few extra minutes
they have to wait could save their lives — and
those of many others.

Time to get back to the
good old days of partying

Who remembers the good old days
when partying meant that you and a
select group of your closest friends
would go to your local party spot, get
trashed and have the time of your life? I
long for those days constantly.

Parties today, especially college
ones, have gone consistently downhill
and ' show no signs of improvement.
There are several different types of col-
lege parties, which have many ﬂaws and
need to be changed for us to get back to
those good old days.

Add some bad music and easy girls and
you’ve officially got a Pitt frat party.

0 ‘The house party: You’ve all seen
them, and some of you probably even
host them. South Oakland has an abun-
dance of them, and for some reason
freshmen ﬂock to them by the dozen.

always too small, packed with people
you don’t know, and dirtier than a

Then we learned to fix our system and
took our parties indoors with cold cases

collegestudents could learn.

Modem day college keggers have
potential but are executed poorly
because people are idiots or are cheap;

Jerry’s jihad: Falwell’s remarks echo bin Laden’s

“I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and
the femiriists, and the gays and lesbians who are actively try-
ing to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People
for the American Way — all of them who have tried to secu-
larize America — I point the ﬁnger in their

that Falwell, like bin Laden, believes that there is currently a

jihad (holy war) being fought and that God is on his side.

Nor is this_ the ﬁrst time that Falwell’s rhetoric has
echoed bin Laden’s. Bin Laden began his holy war by issu-

face and say, ‘You helped this happen. ”’
— Reverend J eny Falwell

Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein
have found an ideological friend in Jerry
Falwell. The above, delivered by Falwell
during the Sept. 13 broadcast of the
Christian television program ‘The 700

 

the Americans and their allies e civilians and mil-

‘ itary ~ is an individual duty for every Muslim.”

. Falwell has issued a similar proclamation, saying,

“Preaching against the sin of homosexuality is the

responsibility of every minister who takes the
Bible seriously.” ‘ '

Bin Laden is ﬁghting America, the so-

called Great Satan. Falwell is ﬁghting homosexu-

often associated with Middle Eastern dicta-
tors than with Christian television.

ality, what he has called a “vile and satanic'sys-
tent”
Bin Laden ﬁghts with bombs. Falwell

Later in the same show, Falwell further
blurred the lines between his beliefs and that of the Sept 11
attackers by saying that, because of the previously -rnen-
tioned groups, God had allowed “the enemies of America to
give us probably what we deserve.” _ .

This is the type of offensive drivel that gives self-right-
eous, hate-mongering loudmouths a bad name. It’s hardly
surprising that Falwell had the audacity and tastelessness to
say such things just two days after the attack _

This is, after all, the same man who during the course of
his career tried to “out” Tmkie-Wmkie, the purple Teletubby,
and announced that the Antichrist was living among us in the
form of a Jewish man.

Though unsurprising, Falwell’s latest comments are
more than just another embarrassing incident from the for-
mer leader of the now-defunct Moral Majority. They signal

ﬁghts with words.

Bin Laden wants to remove the American presence
from the Middle East. Falwell wants to remove Tmkie-
Wmlde from television. «-

They are two checks of the same metaphorical ass, and
to extend this already crude metaphor further, they both
stink

Though an agent of hatred just as surely as bin Laden is,
Falwell is no threat to the freedom of Americans. No mili-
tary action will be needed to stop him. No economic sanc-
tions will be needed to silence him.

By ﬁghting for hatred and narrow-mindedness it an  

ever more progressive and educated society, Falwell has
made himself vulnerable to the only force that can take him
down: irrelevance. C

With every embarrassing diatribe, Falwell ﬁnds himself

ing a fatwa (religious edict) which said, ‘To kill _

with fewer and fewer allies. The former leader of the Moral
Majority is now a liability to the Christian Right, and few
people in Washington are willing to have their names asso-
ciated with his. .

As the bold Ku Klux Klan members of the past eventu-
ally slunk into the shadows, so will Jeny Falwell. As the
once-proudly ﬂown Confederate ﬂag became an ugly
reminder of past hatreds, so too will Jerry Falwell.

But for now, Falwell, who pointed his ﬁnger in the face
of pagans, feminists, gays, lesbians, victims of the attacks
and the country as a whole, should know just one thing. We
are pointing a ﬁnger ﬁght back in your direction, and there
are far more of us than there ever were of you.

Absurd theatrics

Pitt Rep Theatre stages Beckett

Waiting for Godot
Through Oct. 7

ARIEL JOHNS
The Pitt News

Although “Seinfeld” —— a sitcom about
nothing — may now be in syndication,
Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot” — a
play ostensibly about nothing -——- is currently
running at the Pit Repertory Theatre.

The two main characters, Estragon and
Vladimir, portrayed respectively by Alex
Coleman and Larry John Meyers, are sitting
in a park waiting for their “ﬁiend” Godot
Neither knows who Godot is or why they are
waiting for him. Just as the two protagonists
anxiously await his arrival, so does the audi-
enee.
The play starts with Estragon trying to
remove one of his boots. The moment
Vladimir walks on stage the two start bicker-
ing over nonsense. The topic of the argument
keepsshiﬁingandtheaudiencelaughsathow
little sense each character makes.

The two characters meet two men, Pozzo
and Lucky, during their wait. Pozzo, played
by Doug Metz, is overdramatic and egotisti-
cal. Matt Gaydos plays Pozzo’s faithﬁrl ser-
vant Lucky, who must cater to -his every need.

While the four characters interact on
stage, the audience laughs at the stupidity of
the questions each is asking to the other. None

of the characters listen, they only speak
Lucky’s solo performance provides one

of the most humorous parts of the play.

Gaydos excellently fools everyone into

’ believing that he is stupid and crazy.

Following in ﬂte footsteps of “Seinfeld’s”
Kramer, he sports wild hair and eccentric
cloﬂres. His eyes are big and his mouth always
gapes. Gaydos can change his accent at any
moment and speaks quickly, but also clearly.

Pozzo and Lucky eventually leave, and
the two protagonists continue to wait for
Godot. More slapstick humor and ﬁrnny lines
follow.

The play shiﬂs when Estragon becomes
scared and Vladimir comforts him. There is
no music, only silence. Both actors do an
excellent job showing how much their ﬁ'iend-
ship means to each of them.  covers
Estragon with his coat to keep him from shiv-
ering in his sleep. As the scene ends, the two
embrace.

Even though the play progresses, there is
no action, conﬂict or scene change. The few
props remain on the stage the entire time. The
story does not pick up and the plot does not
thicken Each time one of the characters
speaks, itis likeaplaywithinaplay.

“Waiting for Godot” is a very different
play in the fact thatthere is no real plot, cos-

tumes or props. The humorous lines and slap- '

stick keep the viewers watching but also ques-
tioning Beckett’s real reason for writing this
play. There is no right or wrong answer to this
dilemma The audience is left to openly inter-
pret its meaning. '

A common saying entreats us to take a moment to “stop

 

and smell the roses,” but rose petals can become intoxicat-
ingly sweet and sickening especially if we continue to smell
the same old tired ﬂowers. Why not move on and try to exer-
cise one of the other senses? Which brings us to Edith Frost’s
third album, Wonder Wonder

WhyisFrostso sad?0nﬁrst1istenonemightassume
she was a little country girl contemplating life on horse pas-

tures but this cowgirl comes straight from the city —— which
casts a little light on why her wild heart is
dramatically cheerless. Instead of just
singing country perhaps Edith should go
andvisitthecoumry.Perhapsthenshe
would have something to celebrate. (She is rumored to never

have been camping.) She sounds kind of folksy, but sad.

Frost embraces a slow and simple style. The meditative
quality of her calming and relaxing album is conducive to
unwinding. Her lyrics are "cautious but tired as she sings
sullen songs of roots, of love and of life in minuscule
moments. "

She quietly suggests that We should all take the time to
notice the things around us. Sadly, her versatile voice, pleas-
anﬂy quirky and deep, has nothing new to say. She is farnil—
iar, safe and dull-edged, but somehow intriguing. You can’t
help but hear her. She has talent that is ﬂattered yet over-
powered by an eclectic musical accompaniment of clarinets,
bells, bass and other strings and things. It breaks down the
boundary between boring and kind of groovy, and is actual-

Steal This Record

The Suicide Machines

Hollywood Records
'i2ril‘ri1‘r

Punks of the world rejoice: the Suicide
Machines are back, and they’ve brought a new
album.

Steal This Record is hard—hitting, straight-up
punk. It’s full of determined lyrics, trouncing gui-
tars and crashing cymbals, with a couple of sur-
prise tracks, too.

After 10 years in the music business, the
Suicide Machines show they haven’t lost their gui-
tar ferocity, gritty vocals or pounding bass-and-
drum combination.

The Suicide Machines are emphatic about
their fourth album on the Hollywood Records
label and say that it is their best album yet. By the
overall sound of the album, it’s hard to think any-
thing less.

Anthems “The Killing Blow” and ‘‘All My
People” are laced with old-school" punk inﬂu-

ences. “Unbreakable,” “Brass Ring” and “Off The
Cuff” will satisfy all thrashing needs.

“Honor Among Thieves” is an autobiographi-
cal look at the Suicide Machines and their history.

“The R.E.M. Song” covers the R.E.M. classic,
“It’s the End of the World as We Know It.” You
might think that the last band the Suicide
Machines would cover is  but they make a
convincing attempt. .

Another surprise is the combination ska/reg-
gae tune, “Stand-up.” This Bob Marley—esque
song is unexpected from the Suicide Machines,
but they- exert an impressive effort at a more
diverse sound, as well as try new techniques and
methods of expression.

With only one track breaching the four-minute
barrier, the album plays Very fast. Steal This
Record has 15 tracks, but if you walk away from
the CD player you’ll probably miss something.

Loud and raw, Steal This Record is the antithe-
sis to the “pop—punk” movement; it’s everything a
true punk fan could ever want.

Don’t do what the title implies. Steal This
Album is well worth the cash.

Ramblin’ men

So Many Worlds

Rambient
Immergent Records
iksktk

For once, an eclectic mix of musical genres is found on an
album other than a movie soundtrack. Porno for Pyros guitarist

Peter DiStefano and ﬁlm composer Harry Gregson—Williarns

teamed up to create the group Rambient. _

So Many Worlds, the title of Rarnbient’s first album, describes
the songs perfectly. From rap to rock, techno to piano, this album
proves that different styles can mesh and still get along.

An array of instruments and voices produces a fun and upbeat
sound. In each of the songs, bass is essential and the attitude is all
about optimism. This is where the similarities end. The electric
guitar steals the limelight in “Power” while “Killa Machine”

focuses on the smooth rapping of Divine Styler. Three songs later

» .  “Birth of a Girl” skips lyrics
altogether. Instead, piano
music and acoustic guitars
take the lead.

The cover song,
“Hunicane,” slows down the
album’s pace with the breezy
vocals of Lisbeth Scott while
simultaneously incorporating
a strong beat. This, along with
the harmonious voices in
“Fresh Skin” and the punchy
R&B rhythm of “So Many
Worlds” make up the best of
the album. Several of the

 

.. . . . .  « other songs, unfortunately,
tend to sound like techno music gone sour or the soundtrack to a
documentary on outer space. ‘

Although a good deal of the CD contains rapping, it conveys
neither the rhythm nor the power of the best hip-hop performers.
In “Burn,” the rapping resembles talking in rhymes more than it
does rapping. The beeps, synthesizers and philosophical voices
that pop out of nowhere in “All That Is” make the song so distinct
it does not easily fit into any specific category of music.

Overall, the songs are almost great to dance to, but just a lit-
tle too slow. Often, the songs lose the beat and replace it with
strange but beautiful sounds. These sounds meander along the
musical scale. They give the impression that the musicians are let-
ting the music go where it wants to.

So Many Worlds gives listeners the opportunity to hear a
diverse group of musicians as they experiment with new sounds
and blend different styles and ideas. While not very impressive,
the ﬁnal result is artistic.

Pipe dreams

Underneath

The Verve Pipe
RCA Records
»“n£r1/2

Summer is not just a description of a
season, but also a description of music.
Summer is often associated with breezy,
mellow, beat—heavy rock, like Smash
Mouth’s “Walkin’ on the Sun” and
Sub1ime’s “Doin’ Time.” These happy sun-
shine songs sound ﬁne when they’re played
between June and August. The fact that The

Verve Pipe’s new record,
Undemeath, was released yes-
terday suggests the band must
have forgotten to change their
calendars.
Here, in the realm of sum-
mer music’s post-mortem
. slumber, Underneath is easily
under—appreciated. Its mood and atmosphere
conﬂict with the fact that temperatures are in
the 603. If you can ignore the alburn’s
eclipsed expiration date, it still has a few dia-
monds mixed in with the rough.
Underneath deﬁnes a giant departure
from the band’s RCA debut, Villains, and the
absence of gritty songwriting and electric

guitars are immediately noticeable. The soft
tracks “Only Words” and “Never Let You
Down” open the album up with reasons to
smile. Unfortunately the third installment, “I
Want All Of You,” brings the pleasantries to
a screeching halt with its lyrical bankruptcy.
Reminiscent of a nursery rhyme, lines
like, “Whisper words into your ears/I will
never bring you tears” unearth echoes of
love notes passed in third grade. Other
mediocre tracks, like “Miles Away,”
“Medicate Myself’ and “Gotta Move On”
only take tired jabs at life’s little problems.
It takes the beautifully poppy
“Happiness Is” to ﬁnally resurrect the record.
Underneath’s lone thought-provoker lies in

its ballad of a title track, the album’s last
piece, if you make it that far.

Overall, The Verve Pipe’s new effort
isn’t bad, but it’s far from great Fans of the
band’s deeper hits like “Hero” and
“Freshmen” might hear the void left by the
lack of purpose on Undemeath.

Each offering only skirns the surface of
the abstract topics of love and anger. They’re
playful, but not much else. In July,
Underneath would ﬁt right in witha humid
blend of lazy, windows—down, volume-up
cruising music.

Today it feels like holding an ice cream
cone inthe rriiddle of December.

Thrill Jockey
ski‘:

Had Mazzy Star and Peter, Pa11l and
Mary ‘collaborated to produce elevator
music, tl1e result would probably sound a
lot like Pullman. Especially if they were
mute. '

Pullman’s latest album, Viewﬁnder
combines sixgkinds of guitars and an array
of unusual instruments to create its mellow
sound. -

This Chicago-based band gained popu-
larity with Directions in Music in 1996 and
Tumstyles and Junkpiles in 1998. Pullman
originated as a side project among estab-
lished musicians, but quickly grew in popu-
larity. The support of acoustic guitar fans
and those who enjoy quaint bands on the
fringe of popular rock helped make
Pullman last;_ Ina world ﬁlled with whiny

rock bands and depressing lyrics, Pullman
deviates from the mainstream to produce
optimistic, totally instrumental songs.

Despite the lack of lyrics,_ the band
manages to demonstrate their musi_,calmas—
tery. There is no question that band mem-
bers Chris Brokaw, .Ken Brown, Curtis

Harvey, Doug McCombs and Tim Barnes ,

know how to play the guitar.

They also know how to pick interesting “P

titles for their Wordless songs. “Same Grain
with New Wood” repeats a handful of
chords throughout the song. Unfortunately,
this practice of repetition recurs throughout
the album. Additionally, just as each song’s
internal structure has little variation, each
song tends to melt into the next Therefore,
at the beginning of track eight, one may be
tempted to burst out uncontrollably, “Hey!
Isn’t this ‘Same Grain with New Wood?’”

9 But it’s not. It’s actually “Chicken Smoked

Blanket” The same chords played repeat-
edly have the potential to beoorne irritating.
But if you stick with it for a while you will
soon ﬁnd yourself bobbing your head to the
repetitiveness.

Perhaps VieMg’inder’s true gem is the

slow, seductive rhythm of “Is1a Mujeres.”
With a hint of ﬂamenco ﬂavor and melan- .

cholic guitar chords, this song adds ethnic
spice to an otherwise bland album.
Also watch outfor “Brewster Road.”
Neither. country nor folk music, this song
falls somewhere in between and possesses a
_di\stinctly Pullman sound. The music ﬂows
slowly and prettily. Drums and cymbals
distinguish it from the rest of the songs.

. Pullman’s mellow sound and lack of .

lyrics can easily lull one to sleep. None of
the songs are so loud that they easily cause
headaches, but none of them are particular-
ly interesting, either. Viewﬁnder contains
airy, New Age-type music that is pleasing to
the ear but not to the student who is trying
to stay awake and study.

A bigger problem is that the first

three quarters and the last quarter of the ’

ﬁlm seem to be completely different. In

players and the legality of one player

blown away by your ability to show
up.” This distracting wisdom comes
from nowhere and makes the ending
feel somewhat forced and less emotion-
al. ' ' '
The film is primarily about human
redemption with baseball as a back-
ground. The audience doesn’t see
enough of the sport, and because of this

glaring problem, the redemption seems ’

phony. ‘

The ﬁlm drops the ball on what
could have been an interesting and
human story.

The singer/songwriter tone of the

Simon and Garfunkel, Pete Yom and

‘His Airness’
returns for his  

third comeback

 

SI-nus Vrnw

Matt Miloszewski

Well, the worst kept secret in sports
history is no longer a secret. Finally, it’s
official'——- Michael Jordan will return to
play in the NBA.

Late Tuesday afternoon. “His

V Aimess” ﬁnally sent his fax to NBA

offices to declare his intentions to_ play
for his Washington Wizards. *

Unfortunately, they are no longer his
Wizards. In accordance wit_l1 NBA rules
a player can’t own and play for the same
team as Mario Lernieux did this season
for the Penguins. So Jordan sold his
shares of the team and signed a two-year
contract to play ‘for the Washington
Wizards. , ‘

Jordan, being the stand-up guy he is,
will donate his whole ﬁrst year’s salary
to the September 11th Relief Fund. Can
the return of the greatest player to ever

. play the game turn one of the NBA’s

worst teams around?

jI know some of you may not agree’

with my last statement, but face it —
who has changed the game more? Who
has made every kid basketball player
want to go out and buy Nike Air
J ordans? Who has dominated and gotten
the most out of average players on his
team? The answer is simple: Michael
Jordan.

Jordan accomplished everything

- there is as an NBA player, but at the age '

of 38, will he be the same?

The answer to these questions is yes. ~

Has Jordan lost a step? Probably, yet
Jordan at 80 to 90 percent is still better
than 80 to 90 percent of the NBA. Let’s
face it, Jordan is one of the most com-
petitive athletes-ever. Does anyone out
there really think he would have come
back if he could not compete at a high

Women’s soccersurging

_ NATALIE KRASMAN & MICHAEL HAMIDI
The Pitt News

The tragedy that occurred on Sept.
11 hindered Pitt’s women’s soccer team
with the cancellation of two games
scheduled for Sept. 14 and 16 against
St. John’s and Arizona.

But those events. did not affect the
concentration of the women, who
defeated Georgetown 2-1 at Founders
Field on Friday.

“We were sensitive to the plight of

the tragedy, but felt relief to get back ‘to
normalcy and return to playing,” head
coach Roland Sturk said. ,

Sturk added normalcy back to the
team practice on Sept. 17, after allow-
ing the women to have light practices
on Sept. 13 and 14.

“The practices held on Thursday
and Friday, the week of the tragedy,
were easy. We tried to keep active, but
not overly critical,’ and we used it as a
release of tension,” Sturk said.

The team resumes its season goals
this week with a readjustment to the
team’s list of accomplishments for each
quadrant of the season. The start of the

.second quadrant, and consequentlythe '

team's goals, were postponed because
of the cancellations, but were put back
into effect against Georgetown.

“The games that were cancelled, we
eliminated out of the quadrant, and this
is the start of a new quadrant with sim-
ilar goals,” Sturk said.

The team’s goals for the second?

quadrant mirror the goals of the first —
two wins and two shutouts.

Cross country upsets‘WestVirginia

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Just like everyone else, the Pitt
cross country teams started over this
weekend. ‘

Last week’s Penn State Spiked
Shoe Invitational was cancelled for
obvious reasons, and the teams
weren’t scheduled to run again until
6. But head coach Waddie
Freeman signed the men and women

up for a highly competitive meet at ~

Miami of Ohio.

“The kids would’ve been off for a
month, so we needed to ﬁll that void,”
Freeman said.

The lOth—rariked women’s team,
which had been unranked in the Mid-
Atlantic region before the season,
showed no signs of rust at the meet,
losing only to host school Miami. Pitt
also upset perennial Big East power-
house, No. 4-ranked West Virginia.

“Miami is a very good team,”

Freeman said. “They beat No. 24-_

ranked Michigan up at their place two
weeks ago. It was probably the first
time in school history that we beat
West Virginia.”

Amanda Schmidt continued on the
tear that she’s been on since the out-
door track season, finishing the 6,000-
meter course of rolling hills and many
turns in ﬁfth place with a time of 22
minutes, 32 seconds. ' _

Can Syracuse cover three weeks in a row?

Another 2-2 last week brings my record to 7-
6 for the season. But don’t worry — this week
I’m picking five games, so I’ll either be a winner
or a loser, but I’m guaranteed not to be average.

-Last week Virginia Tech came through by
blowing out Rutgers (what a shocker), and Iowa
State covered easily against Ohio.

Florida State cost me, but who in the hell
would have guessed that it would lose to North
Carolina by 34 points? And I learned my lesson
never to play another Alabama game this season.
It turns out I would have been better off taking
the games that I placed in the “extra, extra” sec-
tion as Nebraska and Kent State covered.

Miami (-25)‘at Pitt

I picked Pitt this week in the Papa John’s
picks for morale reasons, but unless Ken Dorsey
gets kidnapped, I’d be a fool not to take Miami.

I really wouldn’t touch this game but since
this is The Pitt News and since everyone reading
this either goes to Pitt or went to Pitt, I feel
obliged to take a look at the game.

If this game was on a Saturday, it’s safe to
say that an additional 10 points would be added
to this spread. Many would say that this game
could be close because of the emotion factors
that come along with a nationally televised night
game, but not this time.

As much as I love Lee Greenwood,_ no game
this season will top the emotions that were
packed into Beaver Stadium when Adam

Taliaferroled Penn State onto the field for its
Saturday night game against Miami.

That Saturday night, emotion was quickly
offset by reality, when Miami ripped Penn State
apart, 33-7. The Hurricanes have outscored their
opponents 94-7 this season and have won 11
straight games, the second longest winning streak
in the nation — Oklahoma leads with 16.

South 'Florida’s Marquell Blackwell passed
for 343 yards and four touchdowns against Pitt,
and he is no Dorsey. Dorsey completed 35 of 52
passes‘ this season for 659 yards and five‘ touch-

The men’s soccer team contin-
ued its struggling ways last weekend
after being shut out by Villanova, 2-
0, at Quaker Valley High School.

“This loss was a disappoint-
ment,” said men’s soccer head coach
Joe Luxbacher. “I thought that we
could have played better than we
did.” ~

The Wildcats wasted no time in
drawing first blood, when_ junior
defenseman Steve Leaman scored
against Panther goalie Justin Gaul 8
minutes, 43 seconds into the game.

Leaman headed the opening goal
after he received a cross pass, which
got by‘Gau1. Joe Caruolo sent the
cross pass to Leaman and picked up
an assist on the play. -

For his defense against Pitt and
for his play earlier in the week in a

3-1 victory over Temple, Leaman»

received the Big East defensive
player of the week award.

The score remained 1-0 until the
65th minute of play when Villanova

Tony Rod.pRod was set up on the
right side of the box and deflected
an errant Panther pass past Gaul for

the netter.

“We are not getting the play
from the players we need play
from,” Luxbacher said. _

The Panthers were Outshot in the

contest 8-5. Freshman Jeff Krause

was the biggest offensive threat for
the Panthers, registering three of the
team’s five shots. Mark Sikora and
Marco Carrizales each had one shot
in the Panther effort. '
Gaul made four saves in the
game, giving him a tota_1 of 36 for
the season in the*team’s six games.
Villanov.a’s goalkeeper Sean
Teesdale _recorded the shutout. He
received the Big~East Co—goa1keeper
of the week award for his play. L
“‘Not to take anything away from
Villanova, but I just thought that we
would have played better,”
Luxbacher said. V
The Panthers, who are in last
place in the Big East Conference,
dropped their record to 1-5 overall,
0-3 in conference play. The Wildcats
upped their record to 2-3 overall and

“Gretchen Ross did a very good job

. for us for the past four weeks, but there

is something about Rachel’s‘ presence
and leadership that lifts the team. It is
good to have her back,” St11rk said.
Brown had a solid first gameback,
allowing only one of six shots to enter
into the Panther net. That one shot came
when Hoyas __
DeLorenzo deﬂected a pass from team-

mate Karin Ostrander, and DeLorenzo’

chipped the ball past Brown into the left

corner of the net, putting the Hoyas o

the scoreboard ﬁrst. '
The Hoyas retained their lead into

the half, but the Panthers were on the ~

prowl and looking to-score.

Nine minutes into the second half, 1 ~

redshirt sophomore forward Annette
Agredano marked up her second goal of
the season by outwitting Chang with a
comer kick. The game-tying goal was
assisted by teammate Kimberly Sturk.

With the score tied 1-1, the Hoyas ’

threatened to invade Panther territory,
but defender Cara Kappler would not
allow it. The nimble Kappler aided
Brown at the goal line when she

knocked away an attempt made by«

Hoyas midﬁelder Nicole DePalma.
Only a few minutes after

DePalma’s attempt, Fix and teammate

Melissa Smith threatened to open up

defender Christy A

the game. After receiving a pass from

Smith, Fix focused her eyes on the net. 

Fix saw the defense of Chang and lifted
the ball just over her head and into the

Brown named goalie of the week

KENNETH PAUL
A Sports Editor

After _missing the Panthers’ first
four games of the season with a medial
collateral ligament sprain, Rachel
Brown returned to play leading Pitt to a
win and a tie on her way
to becoming "the Big
East goalkeeper of the
week.

In her first action of
the season, Brown made
five saves, in a 2-1 win
over Big East rival
Georgetown last Friday.

' Just two days later
the Panthers returnedto
action against No. 21-
ranked Auburn and
behind nine Brown
stops, the Panthers came
out of the game with a 0-
0 tie. ‘ '
“Rachel brings so much to the team
with her leadership and her goalkeep-
ing,” Panther head coach Roland Sturk
said. “She played a big part in our team
coming out of this week with a confer-
ence win and a tie against a nationally
ranked team.”

Brown was named the Big East
Conference’s Goalkeeper of the Year
for the 2000 season. She gave up, on
average, less than two goals a game.

 

COURTESY OF Pm ATHLETICS

Her 1.72 goals against average from A

last season is a Panther record.

The conference’s coaches honored
Brown as the Preseason Goalkeeper of
the Year before the start of the 2001
season but she had to wait until the
Georgetown game to make her season
debut. "

The double-overtime
scoreless tie with Auburn
was Brown’s 13th career
shutout and her third as a
Panther. Brown trans-
ferred to Pitt from
Alabama.

She will look to con-
tinue to impress this

Can Jordan still be the best at age 38?

level? He wouldn’t do that, yet some
people disagree, like Jason Whitlock of
the Kansas City Star.

V “You might see. Jordan turn into a
SportsCenter Christmas tree, getting lit
up every night,” he said. I

Could he get schooled and burned by
the new younger NBA? Yes, but not in
this writer’s opinion. Jordan has been
training for months working out almost

' eight hours a day.

‘Perhaps it may take Jordan a little
time to turn this young team around, a
team that was 19-63 last year and a long

way from making the playoffs. That was
before. That no longer matters.
The Wizards had the first overall

— pick and took high school star Kwame

Brown and at the end of last season trad-
ed veteran Juwon Howard for young
players, Courtney Alexander and Eton
Thomas.

Jordan, along with the almost adoles-
cent supporting cast like Richard
Hamilton and Jahidi White, will be bet-
ter. But if they improve by 20 games,
which would be a tremendous tum-
around, it still wouldn’t be enough for the
playoffs.

A 39-53 record certainly is not a

record that Jordan would be proud of,
and that will just not do.

What do I think will happen? Jordan
will lead this team to the playoffs. If not
this year, certainly next.

You may be asking how Jordan will
handle the NBA’s new young stars like
Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Vince
Carter and Tracy McGrady. He won’t
have to.

Jordan most likely will match up

with the opposition’s small forward.

Don’t let‘ this fool you. Every young
player in the NBA will attempt to make a
name for himself by going after a man
who is old enough to be some players’

“It’s only a matter of time before

Nebraska, Boston College should cover big

Locks,page 18

its record at 2-2, after getting quali-
ty home wins against Central
Florida. and Auburn.

Head coach Paul Pasqualoni
made the right choice by benching
quarterback Troy Nunes and replac-
ing him with R.J. Anderson.
Anderson doesn’t make any mis-
takes, and he is more than capable
of handing the ball off to James
Mungro.

,Mungro carried the ball 23 times
last week against Auburn for 142
yards and three touchdowns.
Coming into the game, Auburn had

the 10th ranked rushing defense in
the nation. ' '

Anderson did some ball carrying
of his own, rushing for 59 yards.
Syracuse’s two losses come at the
hands of Tennessee and Georgia
Tech. Facing that kind of stiff com-
petition will only help the team
now. '

ECU (2-l) has given up more
than 100 yards rushing in all three
of its games this season, including
294 yards on the ground in its open-
ing loss to Wake Forest.

The Syracuse defense has been
stingy all season. Leading the
defense is linebacker Dwight

Freeney, who forced two fumbles
last week. He has seven sacks on the
season. My money is on the ‘Cuse.
Syracuse 27, East Carolina 17' 3

Nebraska (-23) at Missouri

Earlier this season, Missouri lost
at home to Bowling Green, 20-13,
so what do you think is going to
happen this Saturday?

There’s only one Word to
describe Nebraska this season: dom-
inating. The Cornhuskers -have
outscored their opponents by an
average of 26 points per game and
are coming off of a 48-3 destruction
of Rice.

Missouri gave up 194. yards on
the ground to Bowling Green, and
nobody runs the ball more effective-
ly than Nebraska. The ‘Huskers
average 241 rushing yards a game.

Running back Dahrran Diedrick
scored five touchdowns this season,
averaging just less than 100 yards
per game, and his colleague
Thunder Collins has four scores of
his own on the ground.’

Amazingly, Diedrick ‘’ and
Collins might not even be the most
dangerous runners on the team,
because quarterback Eric Crouch
can break one at any time. He had
97 rushing yards for two touch-
downs in last week’s game.
Nebraska 44, Missouri 13

Auburn (-51/2) at Vanderbilt

Vandy has been a competitive
team this season, ‘losing to Alabama
at home earlier this season, 12-9.

It’s a team that likes to throw the
ball as senior quarterback Greg

Zolman leads the attack. He threw ,

for 253 yards against ‘Bama and
completed 20 of 32 passes for 236
yards in last week’s win against
Richmond. Senior running back
Lew Thomas is averaging 7.9 yards
per carry. 1

As experienced as Vandy is on
offense is exactly how inexperi-
enced Auburn is on offense. Auburn

turned the ball over four times last ‘

week against Syracuse and freshman
quarterback Jason Campbell was not
only rattled by four sacks, but by a
raucous Carrier Dome crowd. ' '
Vanderbilt, has a loud crowd of
its own and Campbell and freshman
running back Ronnie Brown, who
carried the ball 12 times for ’47
yards, will have to step it up. 2‘
I like Vandy to cover.
