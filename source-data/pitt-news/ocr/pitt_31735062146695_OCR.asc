Men ’s Fraternities

For Fall Rushing Season

Greeks Begin Annual °

Campaign Next Week

Next Monday, a week earlier
than usual, the University's 13
men’s social fraternities will begin
their annual fall rushing. For the
following week freshmen and new
transfer students will be given
every opportunity to learn “Why
fraternity?” and t-o select a group
to join.

Until October 10, no fraternity
man is permitted to approach any
new student on any fraternity mat-
ter or to entertain him in any man-
ner, but after that date, which is
next Monday, until the following
Sunday morning, prospective rush-
ees will ﬁnd that all bars are down.
They will be lunched, dined, and
entertained.

Beginning at 8 o’clock Monday
morning, and until 2 o’clock the
following Sunday morning, fra-
ternity men may approach rushees
with any invitation and upon any
matter, except that the rushee may
not stay overnight at a fraternity
house. After the deadline Sunday
morning, until Monday evening,
October 24 at 5 p.m., there is a
silence period during which a fra-
ternity man cannot speak to or
approach a rushee for any reason.

During this silence period, stu-
dents will be called to the dean’s
oﬂice to accept or reject the invi-
tations or bids to membership
which the fraternities have offered.
No student is obligated by rushing
to accept a bid, nor is a fraternity
obliged to offer one.

All rules, and other informative.
material is available in. the fra-
ternity handbook. Copies may be
secured in the dean of men’s office.

The rules as printed are correct.
None of the proposals ‘offered at
the last IF council meeting were
accepted. Chief proposal was the
one to limit the rushing to 10:30
o’clock every evening except Fri-
day and Saturday, but this and
other motions were rejected by the
group, because the time was too
short to allow effective use of the

Two color and sound movies will
be presented in Carnegie music
nall, Friday, at 8:15 p.m., for the

C. E. Haterius, noted traveler,
writer, and lecturer, will interpret

cialization projects, the new hous-
ing plan fostered in Sweden, and
intimate glimpses of royalty. A
special feature of the ﬁlm is the
color pictures of King Gustav's
eightieth birthday celebration in
Stockholm.

“Steel—Man’s Servant,” shown

tates Steel corporation, portrays
the drama of steelmaking, with ac-
tual steelworkers in the various
roles. Camera equipment was

Czechoslovakia Betrayed,
Says Dr. Papanek at Inquiry

Czechoslovakia has
trayed but not broken, according
to Dr. Jan Papanek, Czeckoslovak
consul, speaking before the first
meeting of Inquiry Forum yes-
terday.

Presenting a detailed account of
the history, cultural achievements
and international relations of his
country, Dr. Papanek opened his
remarks saying “Czechoslovakia is
not a new country. It was not cre-
ated by a peace treaty. It goes back
to the 6th century when the great
Moravian nation was one of the
best organized countries in the
world.

“We were the cultural center of :

Europe in the 13th century, found-
ing the ﬁrst university of central
Europe at Prague in 1348. We have
continued to increase this cultural
program even in the Sudeten area.
Here, out of every 100 Germans, 94

were sent to free German schools. ‘

In fact, there were more nublic
schools for Germans in Czechoslo-

vakia, than there are in Germany. '

“We have alwa_vs stressed inter-

national collaboration, collective se— '

curity, and have tried to strengthen
international morals for peace.

“It was not the minority problem
that motivated Germany, but the

been be- ..

changed geographical boundary for
1000 years.

“Because these boundaries are
gone, we shall see Czechoslovakia’s
position in international relations
greatly reduced. We will see that
the bill Czechoslovakia paid will
not be for peace, but merely a
postponement to a later conﬂict.”

the entire thirtieth ﬂoor. Besides
the two lecture rooms the studio
contains a clay mixing room where
clay and earth are mixed into suit-

Panthers Block Out Temple
For Second Victory, 28-6

Cassiano, Goldberg, Q

‘combinations of approximately the

Naric Score

PHILADELPHIA—Di.d you ever
see a dream walking? Well, there
was one running around Temple
was one runnng around Temple
Stadium Saturday. And it wasn t a
night game, either. It was Pitt lul-
labying Temple in the colored Octo-
ber sunshine, 28-6.

More than 41,000 easterners ﬁlled
up the new Temple Stadium with
its largest crowd. They came to see
the much-paragraphed national
champions with the “dream” back-
field. That is what they saw——a
dream that walked, talked, and
most emphatically, blocked.

They watched Cassiano and Steb—
bins, the ball-carrying department,
run around the ends and drive
through the tackle holes without so
much as the loss of yard. They
watched Marshall Goldberg and
John Chickerneo lead the way to
that yardage gain with what
should be referred to as perfect
blocking.

Using four fundamental plays,
the Pitt ﬁrst team played about
twenty-six minutes-t‘ne ﬁrst and
most of the third quarter. During
that time Pitt scored three touch-
downs. Every time the first team-
ers grabbed the ball they headed
straight towards the goal line and
went over.

Not once did the ﬁrst team sur-
render the ball. Not once was it
balked before reaching the touch-
down land. And during the period
of first string incumbency on the
ﬁeld only three Temple ﬁrst downs
were recorded.

Five minutes after the game be-
gan Pitt had seven points. On the
ﬁrst series of downs Temple was
forced to kick. Partially blocked by
Hoffmann, the punt was returned
by Chickerneo to the Owl 29-yard
line. Five plays later Dick Cassi-
ano sprinted around right end from
the 10-yard mark to put the ball
across just before he stepped out of
bounds. Daddio’s kick was bar-
splitting.

Pitt obtained the ball next time
on its own 21-yard line. From this
point it was to the right with Cas-
siano, to the left with Stebbins,
and through the center with Mad
Marshall. It went on this way for
79 yards, at the end of which Cas-
siano made an identical touchdown
run as he had a few minutes be-
fore.

The first team’s other points were
made on another continuous march
of 63 yards after receiving the sec-
ond half kick-off. Goldberg went
through left guard for two yards
to score. Daddio place-kicked
through the bars for the third
straight time.

Fourth touchdown was scored by
Emil Naric of the second team in
the fourth quarter. Peace con-
verted.

During the 34 minutes the sec-
ond team played Temple also made
a score. Mike Lukac, a good half-
back, caught a pass from Berrier.

Intramural Leagues

Have 35 Teams

Thirty-ﬁve men, representing 35
separate teams, showed up at the
intramural managers’ meeting at
Trees Gym last Thursday with the
result that head intramuralite
Jimmy Potts is chuckling over the
prospect of one of the most suc-
cessful intramural programs ever
attempted anywhere.

But don't get the idea that Potts
is satisﬁed. He’s not. What’s more.
he won't be satisﬁed until he sees
with his own eyes that 35 teams.
preferably more than 35, are actu-
ally participating in the various
tournaments of the program.

Then, too, there has not been
suﬂicient response from individual
students will regards to tennis and
horseshoes, the two sports on the
fall schedule which are not team
sports. This means that to play
tennis and horseshoes, it is not nec-

essary to belong to an organiza-,
tion or be on a team. Any two“

men may enter the tournament to-
gether, competing throughout the
season as partners against other

H-.—c__.

same ability.

The horseshoe tournament needs
only entries to get it started. New
courts have been put in beside the
Trees Gym tennis courts and have
been so constructed that they offer
ideal conditions to players. The
competition in the horseshoe tour-
ney begins this Thursday.

At present, it seems probable
that the 35 teams entered will be
divided among five leagues. These
leagues are Fraternity, Engineer,
ROTC, Independent, and YMCA.
The plans for the YMCA league
are not completed, as Newman
Club and the YMHA will probably
also be invited into the league.

Managers and representatives of
the various teams and organiza
tions will meet tonight for a din
ner at 6 o’clock in the Universit}
Club. This will provide Boss Pott:
with a chance to fully put acrosr
his program to the managers and
to iron out any questions whicl
may arise.

Once again, it is imperative tha’
all entry blanks be turned in to the
Intramural Oﬁice, Trees Gym, or ti
Mr. Potts by tomorrow evening
Any blanks sent in after that wil
not be accepted.

Review Will Change
Type Face, Paper

When the new issue of Alumni
Review comes out in about ten
days, it will feature several
changes in format, announces Wil-
liam C. Allison, editor.

Beginning its ﬁfth year of pub-
lication, the Review will be printed
on ivory paper, instead of the
white enamel paper formerly used.
Another innovation is the exclu-
sive use of Kennerly type.

Alumni Review was founded
ﬁve years ago by Don F. Saunders,
present executive secretary. Mr.
Saunders, then alumni editor of the
Pitt News, saw the need of an of-
ﬁcial alumni publication. After the
ﬁrst successful year, the Review
has grown steadily in circulation.

WAA Will Hold l

r

On October 12 

l

A hush falls over the white tie’
and tail audience, soft lights play
about the auditorium, and down a
wide swath of white velvet comes
the Veiled Prophet and his con-A
sort. It is the Bal Mystique at St.
Louis, the official end of the social
season.

This year the WAA is holding a
Bal Mystique of its own, October
12. Of course, a few unimportant
incidentals such as the most ex-
pensive orchestras in the country,
he mink gown of the consort and
.he expensive costumes will be miss-
ing. But the mystery and glamour
will all be there. Then, too, this
'1fi’air will mark the opening of the
WAA social season.

A cloud of the unknown hovers
over the head of the main ﬁgure,
the Veiled Lady. All we’re told is
that she will be a Pitt Coed. Her
'dentity is to remain a secret until
the fateful night of the Bal Mys-
tique. Highlight of the evening will
be the appearance of the well»
known dancing master, Karl Hein-
rich, as the guest of the Veiled
Lady.

Ticket of admission to the affair
will be a mask iat each guest
must put on before crossing the
‘acred threshold of the Commons
Room.
