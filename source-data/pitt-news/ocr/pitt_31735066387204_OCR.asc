Investigation into Union incident continues

By Matt Serlin
Asst. Photo Editor

The committee investigating the fight and
resulting arrests of six Pitt students April 1 at
the William Pitt Union has almost completed
its task and will present its findings to the
chancellor in a few weeks.

“We are nearing the end of our formal
investigation,” Pitt’s Executive Director for
Public Affairs Leon Haley said. “Once we
have completed our meetings, a written
report will be presented to the chancellor.”

The university has already given Pitt’s

National Society of Black Engineers financial
compensation for the money it lost as a
result of the incident.

They were the innocent victims of an inci-
dent beyond their control, according to
Haley.

“We made an effort to help them with
their expenses,” Haley said.

According to NSBE President Carmen
Stockton, the university acted quickly in
responding to their request for financial
compensation.

“We are very happy with it,” she said. “It
was done in two days and was a nice sum

of money.”

The committee has had the full coopera-
tion of the campus police, and students on
the committee said they are pleased with
the administration’s efforts.

“I' am very happy with the way they are
handling this,” former NSBE President Soma
Bajpayee said. “The university officials have
been very prompt in this affair.”

While the university police have come
before the committee to give their state-
ments, the city of Pittsburgh police have not
appeared before the group.

University must addresssexism, says speaker

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

Pitt students could gain a more accurate
idea of women’s roles in society if the uni-
versity implemented a process of “curricu-
lum transformations,” according to a
University of Maryland coordinator of such
a program.

According to Curriculum Transformations
Director Deborah Rosenfelt, women have

previously not been properly recognized in
the university setting.

Her “curriculum transformations” would
be a way of letting professors get some
insight into the roles of women in various
fields, insight which they could
use to restructure their courses for a
more balanced view of our and other soci-
eties.

The formerly male-dominated university
ways of thinking have infected every level

of thought in the university, according to
Rosenfelt. This is what she is trying to
amend.

“We have to challenge the methodology
of the sciences and the social sciences that
claim objectivity,” said Rosenfelt. “[We don’t
want] a science that pretends to offer uni-
versal truths.”

“A country like this that deals with rapid
changes would generate a certain amount

For The Pitt News

(Editor’s Note: This is
the second part in a
th ree—part series.)

College students
nationwide who are not
influenced by potential
penalties listed “death”
and “nothing” as the
threats that would deter
them from cheating.

Risks associated with
cheating are so minimal
that less than 50 percent
of self-admitted cheaters
expressed concern about
being caught, according
to a national survey
“Academic Bisircrrresty in ~
the 19905,” published in
The Public Perspective in
1993.

In a similar student sur-
vey conducted by a
Newspaper I journalism
class at the University of
Pittsburgh, 66 percent of
students who were asked
if they thought cheating
at Pitt is easy said, “Yes.”
More than 53 percent
said they have cheated,
and 81, percent said they
have witnessed cheating
while at Pitt.

These figures fall with-
in the range of most
major national studies of
university-level cheating.
In the national survey
above, the typical cheat-
ing rate at universities is
between 40 and 60 per-
cent.

Pitt students are not
alone in viewing cheat-
ing as an acceptable

life in South Africa will never be the same

By Rebecca Baker '
Staff Writer

Life in South Africa during
and after the country’s first-ever
elections will never be the
same, said Madela Mthembu,
who is the assistant to the chief
representative of the African
National Congress.

“There will be violence before
and after the elections,” he said,
“but it’s political violence, vio-

lence for power.”

Mthembu said although “mea—
sures will be taken” to keep the
voting stations safe, violence
will strike 35 to 45 percent of
the 9,000 polls in the country.

The KwaZulu, the group
responsible for election—based
violence in South Africa, is led
by a “crazy man,” according to
Mthembu, who spoke at an
African Student Organization-
sponsored lecture last night in

the William Pitt Union.

“lHel has tasted power and
doesn’t want to let it go,”
Mthembu said. “It’s all emotion.
He’s a short-lived threat.”

“Right-wingers have  been
busy bombing ANC offices
[because] ANC engaged all the
people who will be affected by
the policies of a democratic
government,” Mthembu said.

“But the elections will go
ahead,” he added. “There’s no

way you can stop a movement
that has the support of the
majority of our country.”

After calling apartheid a
“crime against humanity,”
Mthembu explained the core of
the revolutionary movement in
his country.

“Our campaign against
apartheid [was] to make sure we
can make a better living,” he
said. “We say no peasant, no
person should be persecuted-

They should have the right to
live, as long as they subscribe to
democratic norms.”

Mthembu revealed some of
the economic and social prob-
lems the new government will
face once in office.

“Unemployment is 50 per-
cent,” he said. “[Peoplel are
either unemployed, underem-
ployed or unemployable-. We

Pitt student leaders talk politics with legislators

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Members of Student
Government Board and other
student leaders got the chance
to learn more about profession-
al leaders in American govern-
ment Friday.

SGB’s Gubernatorial Relations
Committee held its annual leg-
islative luncheon in the William
Pitt Union. According to SGB
GRC Chair David Kushner, the
annual event drew a mixed
group of students, Pitt faculty
and staff and regional political
leaders.

“lThe luncheon] went really
well,” Kushner said. “We had a
bit of an attrition rate with some
people not showing up, but
overall, we had a good amount
of legislators, a good amount of
students and a good amount of
faculty show up.”

According to Kushner, the
guests were arranged at 12
tables in the ballroom. “We usu-
ally try to have one or two legis-
lators, four students and two
faculty members at each table,
so there’s a mix of people at
every table,” he said. “We had
12 tables and 12 separate con-
versations going on, and it’s
exactly what I wanted to go
on.”

Kushner said the program’s
somewhat informal atmosphere
allows students, faculty, staff
and governmental leaders to
generate conversations quite
easily.

“It’s a relaxed atmosphere
where our committee brings in
legislators from the state so they
can interact with student lead-
ers,” Kushner said. “Our goal is
to get students more involved in
the process of government.”

SGB member Heath Golden

said the annual program helped
serve as a bridge builder
between SGB and other govern-
ing officials.

“I think the message of it is
that we are interested in any-
thing we can do to help and to
try to facilitate communication
between the university and the
legislature,” Golden said.

“It’s our time to show our-
selves off and tell them what
we’re doing, see what they’re
doing and see how we can help
each other,” he said.

Golden said he was able to
make some key contacts with
public officeholders at the lun-
cheon. Golden said
Pennsylvania state Rep. Alan G.
Kukovich expressed interest in
helping SGB gain student sup-
port for public service activities.

According to Golden, he and
Kukovich discussed how to
work with the Pitt Student

Volunteer Action Center, an
Office of Student Activities-
sponsored program which
places students in volunteer
activities that suit their interests.

“[Kukovich and I] were talk-
ing about how students could
become involved in community
relations and what we could do
to improve it,” Golden said.
“We talked about the Volunteer
Action Center that was just set
up, and we made a commitment
to try and work something out
over the summer about how we
could improve it.”

SGB Board Member
Christopher Fedeli said he was
able to learn more about
Pittsburgh city government at
the luncheon from talking to
Pittsburgh City Council member
Christopher Smith.

“It was really enjoyable ..._
Smith gave me a lot of insight
into city politics,” Fedeli said.

Pitt anthropology professor strives
to make classes fun for students

By Jim Clark
Staff Writer

Richard Scaglion said his
mother is sometimes asked by
neighbors to explain what he
and his brother Robert do for a
living.

“He’s managing his own real
estate company,” she would say
of 41-year-old Robert. “He’s
making a fortune. He just
bought his own BMW.”

Then the neighbors would
ask about 46-year-old Richard.

“Oh, he’s still in school,”
responded his mother.

Scaglion is “in school” at Pitt
as one of its most sought—after
anthropology teachers.

“Just about everybody who
wants that class [asks for himl,”
a student advisor said of
Scaglion’s introductory course
to cultural anthropology. “He
has a reputation for being an
entertainer.”

Unlike those teachers who
lecture from behind a podium,
Scaglion walks freely on stage,
microphone in hand, cracking
jokes as he teaches.

“I like to create a relaxed
environment for learning,”
Scaglion said. “I think that
learning can actually be fun,

and it ought to be 

Pitt graduate Anita Francus,
24, had Scaglion’s introductory
course in cultural anthropology
nearly five years ago. She said
that it was one of her favorite
courses at Pitt.

“I liked his class because
he managed to teach everything
and get his points across
without being boring,” Francus
said.

“He showed that you didn’t
have to stand in front of the
class like a statue to be a good
teacher.”

Todd Hoe, a teacher of cul-
tural anthropology at Pitt and a
former teaching assistant of
Scaglion’s for three semesters,
added that Scaglion is “a good
teacher. He’s funny, interesting
and a good performer.”

Pitt recognized Scaglion as a
good teacher by giving him the
Chancellor’s Distinguished
Teaching Award the first time it
was offered at Pitt, a fact
Scaglion said he is very proud
of.

“That was really big,” he said.
“That was the ultimate honor
I’ve had in my career.”

Scaglion’s entertaining style
of teaching was sometimes dif-

‘ficult for a TA like Hoe to deal

with during recitations.

“It was hard,” Hoe said. “On
evaluations, students would put
‘Why can’t you be more like
Scaglion?’ Students expected a
lot.”

Anthropology is not what
Scaglion, a jersey City native,
intended on spending his life’s
work doing when he started his
collegiate career at Lafayette
College.

“I didn’t have a notion of
what I wanted to major in,” he
said.

“I always had done really
well in math. My advisor person
looked at my high school
record and said, ‘Oh, you had
all A’s in math,’ and I said,
‘Yeah.’ So he said, ‘Maybe you
should be a math major,’ and I
said, ‘OK, sounds good to me.’”

Scaglion took a schedule that
was loaded with math. It wasn’t
until his junior year that he had
the opportunity to take an elec-
tive.

“When I was filling out my
schedule with some of my
friends, I said ‘I need a nice,
easy course.’ Somebody said
‘Take anthropology.’ I said,
‘What’s that?”’

He took the class and said he

Pitt professor fights for democracy in Haiti, receives award

By Sam Gresock
News Assistant

In recognition for his efforts in
the struggle for Haitian democra-
cy, Pitt Africana Studies Professor
Dennis Brutus has received the
Lambi Fund of Haiti Award for
Service to Freedom.

The award, which Brutus
received at the Roosevelt Hotel

in Hollywood Saturday night,
recognized his contributions in
promoting democratic govern-
ments in Haiti.

Brutus said his involvement in
the Haitian fight for democracy
has increased in recent years,
though he has been involved
with the cause for quite some
time.

Pitt won its first Universal
Cheerleading Association
title at Sea World in San
Diego on April 9.

Pitt has now won three
national championships, the
other two being National
Cheerleading Association
titles.

“I was excited about win-
ning, but became more excit-
ed for those [cheerleaders]
who won all three champi-
onships,” second-year cheer-
leader Dawn Jubera said.

Pitt competed in the All-
Girls Division, which was
one of five categories. The
other categories included
Co-Ed Division I, Division
IA, Division II and Dance
Team.

This category allowed the
Pitt cheerleaders to send 13
females. and one male. Once
there, the cheerleaders went
through a series of tumbling,
dancing, building team pyra-
mids and partner stunts

“We’ve worked hard this
semester preparing, and a lot
of us worked through spring
break,” Jubera said.

Second-year cheerleader
Rachel Heynes said, “We
entered the competition as
the top spot.”

According to Heynes, the
team competed against San
Diego State University,
Kutztown University and
Southern Connecticut State

Pitt and the other three
teams were selected from 10
teams after submitting video-
tapes that showed skill seg-
ments such as tumbling, toss-
es and building pyramids.

The videos which the
teams submitted also
showed the cheerleaders

of hostility to this  The dream
of an undifferentiated society
was [probably] never true and
is certainly not true today,”
she said during a speech in
the William Pitt Union yester-
day.

Since the 1970s, over 300 cur-
riculum transformations have
been established, but all are
very different from each other,
she said.

Rosenfelt said she wants
the curriculum to explore the
politics of representation
“across the board.” In doing
this, the students would exam-
ine such topics as racism and
sexism in linguistics and the
ways in which the concepts of
racism have helped to construct
many of our concepts in today’s
world.

In her efforts to improve uni-
versity settings, Rosenfelt con-
ducts summer seminars for pro-
fessors to explore how women’s
contributions can be included in
academic curriculums. As an
example, Rosenfelt described
how her summer seminar invi-
tees attempted to redefine
words such as “family” and
“wor 

“The term ‘family’ has to be
recast,” she said. The concept of
the family as simply being a
husband, wife and children no
longer represents the many

other definitions of a “family”
which are out there. She cited
gay and lesbian couples as an
example of “families” which are
not represented under this old
definition.

Next, Rosenfelt said there

needs to be “recognition and
exploration of the matrices of
differences” between both races
and genders.
' She said that when one
begins to examine a group
“which seems to be unitary, the
group begins to dissolve  race
becomes almost fictional” as the
subtleties of the group become
apparent.

Finally, she discussed the
need for acknowledgement and
explanation of the equalities
and differences between the
races and genders.

“We want to work for equali-
ties and at the same time
recognize that there are differ-
ences that have to be acknowl-
edged.”

To illustrate her point,
Rosenfelt asked the audience if
a reasonable man’s concept of
danger is the same as a reason-
able woman’s concept of dan-
ger.

Rosenfelt said one of the
most difficult tasks of these
summer seminars is the “bring—
ing together of faculty in cross
disciplines. [These faculty mem-
bersl really bring in different

assumptions of knowledge,”
she said.

From working with these
people, Rosenfelt described five
“very modest agreements about
teaching” that the summer semi-
nar attendees had come
to. First, they must try to
“make visible what has been
invisible.”

To explain, Rosenfelt told of
an advertisement in a newspa-
per that was searching for cou-
ples to do research experiments
on. Two lesbian graduate stu-
dents applied and were told
that couples implied “hetero-
sexual.”

Next, she proposed that the
faculty show a willingness to
work with students with disabil-
ities.

Professors should not identify
any kind of expression as
“normative or central
[We don’t want to] set up any
unspoken, implicit norms,” she
said.

Assignments that are given to
students should try to “value
different kinds of experience
and skills  not just assign
research papers.”

Finally, Rosenfelt said that the
ultimate goal of this curriculum
transformation is to “try to make
the inclusion of diversity a joy
while simultaneously not mak-
ing it a big deal  This is how it
should be.”

really liked it, despite the fact
that the teacher was “abysmal.”

“Once I found anthropology,”
he said, “I knew I found some-
thing good.”

He took as many anthropolo-
gy classes as he could, but he
graduated with a bachelor’s
degree in math. Still, Scaglion
said he was determined to fur-
ther his education in anthropol-
ogy.

“At job interviews, I thought
about myself sitting in an office
like this, for all eternity,” he
said.

“In anthropology, I get to sit

in an office like this for part of
the year, but then part of the
year I get to do other things.”

He started graduate school at
Pitt in 1969 and has remained
here ever since.

“I’ve seen it [Pitt’s anthropolo-
gy department] from both
sides,” Scaglion said. “Academic
departments shouldn’t have
many of their own graduates,
but I think it’s very useful to
have one.”

Scaglion has researched in
Ireland, Indonesia and Fiji
among other places, but he is
most known for his work with
the Abelam tribe of Papua New

Guinea.

“They’re really an important
part of my life,” Scaglion said of
the Abelam, saying they
showed him ways of life he
wished Americans would con-

sider, including ways of dealing 0

with resolving disputes.

Scaglion, a big sports fan,
studied the Abelam for much of
the 1970s when the Steelers
won four Super Bowls.

“I was once thinking about
writing a letter to the Rooneys
saying, ‘If you want to do well
in the Super Bowl, just buy me
a ticket to New Guinea. You’re
bound to win.’” he said.

One of the strengths of

completely on research,” said
Barr.

Adam MacLuckie, president

who wins because the winning

democratically.

“We respect the diversity of
other cultures and of religious

dominant; all groups can take
place in the development of
South Africa,” he said.

“We will have a government
of unity, to unite the people of
South Africa and the nation as a

Fuller.

MacLuckie agreed and added,

appreciates the international
support South Africa has
received to hold the elections
but said those countries must
not withdraw or lessen their
support once the new govern-
ment takes over.

“We don’t want handouts,” he
said. “We want commitments.”

“I want the people of South
Africa to emerge victorious,”
Mthembu said. “They are now
faced with the possibility of
freeing themselves from
bondage. “I say to all my

Besides sports, basketball in
particular, the Swissvale resi-
dent enjoys free time at a place
he owns in Greene County. But
he never gets too complacent at
the same place, be _it Greene
County or New Guinea, too
long.

“If you’d ask me where I’d
rather be right now, well I’d
rather be in Greene County,”
Scaglion said. “But put me
down there for a couple of
weeks, and I get itchy for the
action of the city all over again.
I think I really need both of
those components of my life,
which is why it’s good for me to

be an anthropologist. I like the
Pacific. I like the weather, the
people, the laid-back atmos-
phere. But you can get too laid-
back, and after awhile you stag-
nate.”

Scaglion said he is happy
doing what he is doing right
now and that he intends to con-
tinue to be an anthropologist
“the rest of my life.”

And teaching will continue to
be part of Scaglion’s existence
at Pitt.

“I’ve stayed in school forev-
er,” Scaglion said, “but it’s
been a good life. I’ve been
happy.”

Brutus said he recently
organized a presentation for
Aristide, who is currently
exiled from Haiti. Along with
the Lambi Fund, Brutus said
he will continue his fight for
Haitian democracy.

“lActivistl Randall Robinson,
for instance, in Washington is
now starting a hunger fast,
and we are hoping other peo-
ple will join that,” he said.

“We’re also planning
protests in Washington and
civil disobedience if neces-
sary, and we hope that by
October, Aristide will be back
in Haiti.”

According to Brutus, the
Lambi Fund takes its name
from the Haitian word for
conch shell. The shell was tra-
ditionally used as a musical
instrument which called com-
munities together in times of
emergency.

Cheating

Continued from page 1
means to excel academically.

In a national pilot study cov-
ering the years 1977-88, pub-
lished in The journal of Higher
Education in 1988, typical
methods of cheating by college
students were listed. The most
common were copying off
another student during a test,
acquiring tests and communi-
cating with other students dur-
ing an exam. 6

Responses to the Pitt survey
and follow-up interviews indi-
cated that Pitt students use these
techniques, as well as cheat
sheets.

“In a large lecture hall like
David Lawrence, you can ask
someone an answer if you are
quiet. Otherwise, writing on
your hands is probably the easi-
est and most popular,” said a
CAS senior.

Another CAS senior said,
“Looking off someone’s paper,

Investigation

writing on desks; I see it all the
time.”

“Copying homework is real
easy. So is writing on body
parts,” said yet another CAS
senior at Pitt.

One percent of cheating stu-
dents are detected, according to
the “Academic Dishonesty” sur-

vey.
Another study, published in
The Higher Education

Administration Series in 1986,
showed that students nation-
wide often believe that what
they learn isn’t relevant to their
future career goals.

It was also found that stu-
dents’ values have changed.

“Student endorsement of the
value ‘being well-off financially’
has increased from 40 percent
to 71 percent. Fifteen years ago
the most popular student value
was ‘developing a meaningful
philosophy of life.’ Recently it
ranked sixth,” according to the

1986 study.

In a study at the University of
Maryland, 45 percent of stu-
dents asked about why cheating
occurred replied that students
cheat in order to avoid failing

“Copying home-
work is real easy.

the class; 21 percent replied that
since punishment is uncom-
mon, cheating is common.
Ironically, according to
the “Academic Dishonesty”
survey, over 90 percent of
students asked said they think
it’s wrong to cheat. But consid-

ering the numbers who do
cheat, the logic doesn’t fit. Many
students appear to have morals
in theory, but the desire to
improve the QPA frequently
intervenes.

Why the pressure to cheat?

W.E. Deskins, associate dean
of the College of Arts
and Sciences, said he believed
that students cheat because
“so many others” cheat and
that some students “feel stupid,
silly or naive if they don’t
cheat.

“Also there is a pressure to get
a high QPA. Many students wor-
ship QPAs. They think it guar-
antees a successful future,”
Deskins said.

Responding to the survey
question of why they felt pres-
sured to cheat, students often
cited grades.

“You want to do well. Grades
mean everything to your
future,” a CAS first-year student

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday‘ Agril 19‘ 1994

said about why he cheated.

Others were more specific,
such as one student who simply
cited “Med-school” as her rea-
son for cheating.

Mark, an engineering student,
said in order to get rid of cheat-
ing, the attitude that grades
mean everything must be elimi-
nated.

Pitt Student Government
Board member Julie Crowell,
who is also a member of the
CAS Academic Integrity Hearing
Board, said she was surprised at
the survey results.

She blamed the numbers on
“sheer laziness.

“I don’t think the numbers
reflect badly on Pitt directly
as much as on our generation.
Our generation, for the most
part, is somewhat lazy,” Crowell
said.

“We are not a public agency,” Haley
said. “We do not have the authority to
call them before the committee.”

Director of the city’s Office of
Professional Standards Carla Gedman
said she understands why they have not
come forward.

“It’s unfortunate they lthe committee]
don’t have the benefit ofthe officers’
statements,” she said.

“I can understand why they are not
getting cooperation because the officers
are not obligated to.” *

Haley said there was no attempt made
to call the officers in front of the commit-

tee because they knew they had no
authority to do so.

“They [the city police] are willing to sit
down with university officials to work
out any problems in a cooperative way
to build a better relationship with the
university community and the Oakland
community,” Haley said.

The Office of Professional Standards
conducts investigations of any public
safety employee accused of misconduct.
Gedman said the office has not received
any formal complaints in reference to the
incident at the union that occurred April
1.

“We have to have something to go on,”

she said. “Depending on the findings of
the committee, we could initiate an
investigation based on their findings.”

Gedman said complaints of miscon-
duct must be filed within 90 days of the
incident.

Students who attended a rally the week
after the incident were told to go to the
office if they saw any police misconduct,
but none have done so as of yesterday.

“We are urging people to go to the
Office of Professional Standards to file a
report if they saw anything,” Stockton
said.

Students have filed reports with the
chancellor’s office, but Stockton said she

still wants more people to file reports.

“There have been a number who have
responded, and we still want people to
come in and put it on paper,” she said.
“We have a lot to work with, but it is
never enough.”

She said students wishing to file a
repoit for the committee to consider can
go to Dr. Nancy Washington’s office in
the Cathedral of Learning.

“I don’t want people to forget about
this,” Stockton said. “If NSBE has to take
further action, I will be here.”

She said she wants people to know
action is being taken and the incident has
not been forgotten.

According to Deborah Rosenfelt, the male—dominated,
Eurocentric university paradigm requires “curriculum
transformations” to “challenge the sciences and social
sciences that claim objectivity.” She has created sum-
mer seminars to correct such wrong thinking among
university professors. Yet, programs like this should
become, in the words of Professor Jaroslav Pelikan of
Yale University, “self-extincting.” '

Such programs make a positive contribution to the
university community by increasing the range of sub-
jects that are studied. These programs increase the
awareness of students, but they also increase the
awareness of the disciplines whose techniques the pro-
grams use to create their particular department’s body
of material. However, before committing significant
amounts of university resources (including, but not lim-
ited to, time, money and research activities) to summer
programs for professors, the real effectiveness of such
programs should be assessed. Their goal should be to
increase diversity within academic departments, not
“challenging” them and the methodology which has
created them thus far.

Making such programs self-extincting provides for
ﬂexibility. Because they do not have to take-a broad
approach, each department can develop a program of
courses that will allow people of any major to broaden
their world view. It would be more profitable for
everyone if there were courses which focused on the
contributions of different groups in different ﬁelds that
could be taken through the history department, for
example, and fulfill general education requirements
rather than counting towards an Africana Studies or
Women’s Studies major. This would encourage students

to study the contributions of groups they may not have

encountered in more traditional history, social science
or humanities courses.

However, it must be realized that the university
should not waste precious resources imposing these
summer “curriculum transformation” programs on pro-
fessors whose subjects cannot possibly introduce diver-
sity. For example, Newton’s laws have nothing to do
with the ability of any group to be treated fairly.
Despite the suggestion that the methodology of the
hard sciences (astronomy, chemistry, physics, mathe-
matics, biology, etc.) is biased, it is impossible to find
where bias exists in these subjects. Unless the propo-
nents of diversity are ready to assert that the world is at
the center of the universe (which would be truly ironic
as it is an idea descended from ancient Greeks), it can-
not be argued that astrophysics is biased.

However, through the assimilation of these programs
into traditional fields, more groups will come to be rep-
resented and true diversity will be achieved.

Health care just another product  

It seems that most proponentsof a national
health care system cannot discuss the issue with-
out getting all teary-eyed and emotional. “We
have to do something for these people. It’s just
not fair!’ (sniff, sniff). Too often, they do not
care what that something is, or whether or not
that something is a sound, logical solution stem-
ming from common sense and individual free-
dom. First of all, to refer to a health care “crisis”
is wrong. The health care system in the United
States should in no way be classified as a “cri-
sis.” The United States currently has the best
health care system in the world. People come
bere for treatment of many serious diseases
because we have the highest success rates and
best quality care. Although some citizens cannot
afford such care, there is not"‘an enormous por-
tion of the population that cannot afford to go
to the dentist or doctor,” as stated by Daniel M.
Goldberg in a letter to the editor of the Pitt News

be for doctors to specialize? Under the Clinton
plan, doctors are actually discouraged to do so.
We’d better hope that no one gets seriously ill,
because under a system of socialized medicine
all we’ll have is a bunch of general practitioners.
How helpful are they if you need open-heart
surgery?

What will happen when our little health care
fund begins to dry up? Will we be denied certain
treatments? Will we have the behavior police
spying on our house to make sure that we’re not
smoking a pack of Marlboros so Uncle Sam
doesn’t have to pay for lung cancer treatment?
Some say that the answer is to force business to
pay for employee health care. Wrong. Guess
whose pocket that money really comes out of?
Businesses look at employees in terms of how
much it costs to hire them, not in terms of their
take—home salaries. If a business has to pay for
almost all of your health care coverage, you’re

expensive to keep around, if you
know what I mean.

The answer to any health care
problem is to get the govern-

So what’s the problem? Well,
Mr. Goldberg asserts that “the current health
care system denies treatment and pharmaceuti-
cals to the needy for the sake of profits.” Mr.
Goldberg, this is the United States of America.
We are a capitalist nation. Everything is done
“for the sake of profits,” which is why the
United States is one of the most prosperous
nations in the world. Health care’s own self-
appointed savior, Hillary Rodham, did not invest
in the cattle futures market because she was
uninterested in profits. She was so interested, in
fact, that she managed to “profit” by almost
10,000 percent in a single year. Being a doctor is
hard work and takes an enormous commitment
of time, money and energy. Most doctors
deserve their salaries.

Furthermore, it is completely wrong to say that
the current system “denies treatment” of serious
illness to anyone. Not only do programs such as
Medicaid and Medicare cover the poor and the
elderly, it is illegal for hospitals’ to turn people
away from emergency rooms for any reason.
Many people who cannot afford health care take
full advantage of this fact.

Nevertheless, there is a need to lower health
care costs. So what does the White House want
to do? Put the government in charge, and hire a
bunch of lawyers to work out the details. That is
just about the most foolish idea that anyone
could think of. Since when can the government
do anything for less money than it would cost
private business? The government will pay $300
for a measly wrench. What incentive will there

ment’s nose out of the medical
industry and into some massive tort reform.

One of the reasons that health care costs are
so high is the proliferation of medical malprac-
tice suits. Doctors have to pay exorbitant insur-
ance premiums and do lots of unnecessary, cost-
ly testing and paperwork just to protect them-
selves from some of the ridiculous lawsuits that
can occur. Perhaps if a little free-mark-et capital-
ism were tried, skyrocketing health care costs
could be brought down to size. When people
have to directly pay for something out of their
own pocket, they will naturally seek out the best
deal that they can find — the highest quality for
the least money.

What ensues are massive price wars like the
kind we see in supermarkets and at fast—food
places. The result? Drops in prices due to com-
petition between doctors and between health
management organizations.

Socialism is not the answer to rising health
care costs — look where it got the Soviet Union.
The Clinton health care package is not about
solving America’s problems. It’s simply another
way of creating government dependency _

which means more power to the state, and less
to the individual. We need the government’s
nose out of our hospitals and its hands out of
our pockets. To quote PJ. O’Rourke-, “If you
think health care is expensive now, just wait
until it’s free.” i

Newcomer outshines stars of Pitt track's past

Ayrton sets Lady Panther
record for 100 meter dash
as Pitt dominates relays

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

Off the track, there was a reunion of
some of the greatest track and field per-
formers in Pitt history at this past weekend’s
Panther Relays.

Some of these former Panthers were two-
time Olympic gold medalist Roger
Kingdom, Lee McRae, Eric Cannon, Keisha
Dumas and Clarissa Dudley.

But on the track, one of the newest mem-
bers of the Lady Panthers family stole the
show.

Zenia Ayrton, a first-year performer from
Bombay, India, electrified the crowd with
her record-setting performance in the 100-
meter dash.

Ayrton’s NCAA qualifying time of 11.56
seconds shattered Ronise Crumpler’s school
record by an ‘unheard of .50. The previous
record was 12.06.

Ayrton, 22, is not at all new to breaking
records.

Last year, she became the first Indian
woman to run the 100 meters in under 12
seconds when she was clocked at 11.95 at
the Asian Track and Field Championships in
Beijing.

The Gulf and News Tabloid gave her the
title, “The Fastest Woman in India.”

tiple-RBI games, nine multiple-
hit games and a team best 12-
game hitting streak.

Gonzalez is tied with Josh
Tyler for the team lead with 57
runs scored this year and is sec-
ond on the team behind Tyler
with 36 hits.

He also leads the team in the
dubious category of being hit
by seven pitches this year,

which shows his desire to win
and his willingness to take one
for the team.

“Gonzo” is also one of the
most durable and dependable
Panthers, starting in 75 straight
games for the diamonders in his
two years at Pitt.

And Gonzalez is the toughest
Panther to strike out this year,
whiffrng only nine times in 112
at—bats for an average of
only one strikeout per 12.4 at-
bats.

“I’m a fastball hitter,”
Gonzalez said. “A lot of the
pitchers think they can slip the
fastball by me because of my
size, but I’ve learned to hit it.

falling apart, so to speak, we
decided to have this kid stay out
[Yanik].”

The Panthers managed to pull
out their sixth-straight Big East
title, just barely holding off
Seton Hall in the championship
match, before losing to 25th-
ranked George Washington by
two points in a f1ve—game first-
round NCAA tournament match
— but they did it at a high phys-
ical price.

Driscoll played well enough
to be a second-team All-Big East
selection despite ongoing prob-
lems with the shoulder injury
that kept her out of the ‘92 sea-
son. She had to have surgery
again this off-season.

Fernandez came in as a rook-
ie last fall with a shoulder prob-
lem of her own. She was
expected to make an immediate
impact, but was limited by the

shoulder. She had arthroscopic

surgery last month.

“She came in with a painful
shoulder and attempted to com-
pete,” Braziel said. “It never got
any better. They finally did
the MRI in the spring, which
could have been done in the
fall. We could have been ahead
of the game with her and had
her as a backup setter in the
fall.”

Mernagh struggled with shin
splints all of last season, and
developed a stress fracture at
some point late in ‘93. The frac-
ture was not diagnosed until a
week into off-season condition-

STUDENT TRAVE

ing.

“Annie Mernagh has a stress
fracture in her shin,” Braziel
said. “[\X/hen she got hurt] was
when the season took a dive.
She was the only setter we had
that could do what we needed
to have done.

“Annie could have competed
[in the spring], but there was no
guarantee that she would have
healed quickly enough over the
summer. Because we had some
other injuries, we pulled her out
and let her heal now so
she could get back in her
training regimen over the sum-
mer and be 100 percent in the
fall.”

Braziel said that she expects
all four of the volleyball players
to be ready by the time fall
practice starts in August.

“Jennie is the most question-
able,” Braziel said. “She will be
able to participate in August,
but we just don’t know where
her arm will be in regards to
swinging. She would be able to
go through all other phases of
the game.

“Right now, Alyssia Yanik is
making tremendous progress,
as is Laurie Fernandez. Annie is
supposed to be healed up by
the end of May, which will give
her June, July and half of
August to get into training.”

Pitt could have tried to go
ahead in the spring, but the
coaches decided to risk the lost
practice time together.

“The goal was to sacrifice the
spring for the good of the fall,”

Pitt setter Annie Mernagh sat out spring drills recovering from a stress fracture.

Braziel said. “It’s a gamble,
because you lose the individual
competitiveness because of
numbers, and you lose a little of
the team comradery because
you don’t have everybody on
the court. V 0
“If we gain 10 out of 10 peo-
ple being healthy, it’s worth it.”
The health of current Panthers
is not the only question

mark for Pitt. The Panthers’

’ recruiting is also still up in the

air.

The coaches have gone into
recruiting with the idea of
bringing in players who would
be good enough to push for a
starting position right away.

“You don’t want to recruit
bench players,” Braziel said.
“One, you don’t want someone

content with the role. Two, you
aren’t going to challenge your
starters, so it’s not going to
make them any better.”

Braziel said that she cannot
talk about specific recruits until
they sign.

Pitt is currently pursuing
two players and waiting for a
signed letter-of-intent from a
third.

Gonzalez

Continued from page 9
After two strikes, I choke up on
the bat, move closer to the plate
and just try" to put the ball in
play.”

This hitting philosophy has
been successful for Gonzalez,
who last year finished 29th
in the nation with a .413
batting average which included
a .446 average in Big East
play.

His 50 hits and 25 walks led
the team while he tied for the
team lead with 53 RBI.

“Gonzo” is also a consistent
fielder, leading the team with 95
assists and sporting a fielding
percentage of .918.

He posted a .954 fielding
percentage last year while
committing only 11 errors,
which is a very low number
for a shortstop who fields a lot
of ground balls and double
plays.

“He likes to take charge and
accepts responsibility,” Reese
said. “If he makes a mistake, he
admits it right away and makes
no excuses, and this is a key
factor in being a consistent
player.”

Gonzalez, who’s been playing
baseball since age 9, was not
recruited to play baseball and
went to Essex in Baltimore, a
junior college.

After a disappointing first

year, Essex won the National
Division I Junior College
Championship his sophomore
year, and Gonzalez was named
outstanding defensive player of
the tournament.

He finished with a .430 bat-
ting average that year.

Gonzalez then talked to
coach Jackson, whom “Gonzo”
said was honest with him and
was committed to winning.

“I just wanted to get better
and win,” Gonzalez said.

And the Panthers are winning
so far this year, sporting a 21-9-
1 record and an 11-1 record in
Big East play. The Panthers,
who set a new club record for
wins last year with 30, are
threatening to better that mark
again this year.

“We’re going as far as the
players [take us],” Gonzalez
said.

“[We will be successful] if we
stay focused and do the little
things and keep executing and
playing hard and keep the
intensity level high.

“I’m just going to pick it up
and stay focused and keep play-
ing real hard.”

“Gonzo” and the Panthers will
be in action again today at St.
Bonaventure at 3 p.m. On
Thursday, they host Akron
University at 3 pm. at Three
Rivers Stadium.

Continued from page 8

The Montreal Canadiens are
the defending champs, and will
be looking to ride the perfor-
mance of their suffocating
defense and superb goaltending
for a run at their second-straight
Stanley Cup and the 25th title in
the history of that dominating
franchise.

And, yes, the Penguins are
back again for a shot at their
third cup in four years.

Here is the first round for the
Eastern Conference as I see it
unfolding:

#1 New York Rangers vs. #8
New York Islanders

Ah, yes the first-round
matchup everybody was dying
to see. The Manhattan Maulers
versus the Long Island  uh 
well, Losers will fit them just
fine once the Rangers do their
job.

Unless something unforeseen
happens, the Islanders will have
exactly one snowball’s chance
in hell of taking this series from
the league’s top team. ,

After a one-year absence from
the playoffs, the Rangers
are once again the league’s
best team from October to
April.

Then again, it’s been exactly
54 years since they were able to
do anything in late April and
May.

In addition to the always-out-
standing postseason play of
captain Mark Messier, the
Rangers will be looking for a
huge contribution from Adam
Graves, one of the NHL’s most
outstanding young two-way
players.

At just 22 years of age, Graves
has already become the crowd
favorite at Madison Square
Garden, having already broken
the Ranger single—season goal-
scoring record that stood nearly
as long as their Cup-less streak
has.

He has come a long way in
seeing to it that nobody remem-
bers his vicious slash on Mario
Lemieux in game two of the
1992 Patrick Division finals,
which kept the Penguin super-
star out for the remainder of the
series. Nobody outside of
Pittsburgh, anyway. .

Look for Graves and right
winger Alexei Kovalev to be the
Rangers’ strengths in this series.
Kovalev was one of the NHL’s
hottest players down the
stretch, and will be difficult for

the Islanders’ defense (or lack,

thereof) to contain.

The Islanders simply do not
have enough proven goal—scor—
ers on their team, and Ron
Hextall is too long removed
from his glory days with the
Flyers to present a real threat
between the pipes.

In the end, Hextall may be
able to steal a game, but the
Manhattan boys will make short
work of this one. Rangers in

five.

#2 Pittsburgh Penguins vs.
#7 Washington Capitals
Don’t give any credence to
the Pens’ blowout losses to
Montreal and New Jersey late in
the season. They were one of

the most consistent teams down
the stretch, and they are always
playoff-ready.

Head coach Eddie Johnston’s
Pens are a year older and wiser
since their early exit at the
hands of the Islanders last year
sent them home to watch
Caddyshack on TBS while the
big boys played on.

I’m looking at you  you
wore green so you could hide.

From all appearances, Mario
Lemieux looks healthy enough
to be available to play in at least
80 percent of the Penguins’
playoff games, which should be
more than enough to handle the
Caps.

The Capitals made the best
move they could have with a
late-season trade of Al Iafrate to
the Bruins for high-scoring cen-
ter iceman Joe Juneau. Juneau is
young, intense and brings
a spark to Washington’s offense
that they will need to
counter the Penguin scoring
machine.

Unfortunately for Capital fans,
even if the Pens lose Lemieux
for a game or two, they have
plenty of warm bodies to fill the
-void. After all, they did win 44
games with the Magnificent One
gone for over 75 percent of the
season.

One player who will really
give the Caps some problems
will be Jaromir Jagr. Washington
has nobody to counter Jagr’s
speed and puckhandling ability.
Jagr is also one of the most diffi-
cult players in the NHL to knock
off his skates, and he is the defi-
nition of a clutch player. Look
for him to be the key in this
series.

In addition, look for Joey
Mullen, Shawn McEachern and
Ron Francis to be huge factors.
Francis’ excellent two-way play
and Mullen’s leadership and
scoring will provide the Pens
with more than enough ammo
with which to dispose of the
Capitals.

Meanwhile, McEachern has
found new life since returning
to the ‘Burgh from his stint in
L.A., and his speed will be
difficult for the Caps to over-
come.

Defenseman Larry Murphy
will play a key role, especially
as a pointman on the power
play, where the Pens will need
to improve if they hope to sur-
vive a long postseason.

Pittsburgh’s ﬁrepower and the
mismatch of Tom Barrasso vs.
Washington’s tag team of Don
Beaupre and former Pens farm-
hand Rick T abaracci in net will
give them the victory against
Washington.

Penguins in six.

#3 New Jersey Devils vs. #6
Buffalo Sabres

Mismatch in every phase of
the game.

The Devils, with a fresh infu-
sion of championship blood,
are one of the best bets to take
the Cup.

Head coach Jacques Lemaire,
who brings Montreal’s winning
tradition to a starving Devils
team desperate for leadership,
has them playing like champi-
ons. His Canadiens-style defen-

sive philosophy has been the
key ingredient in the Devils’ 47-
win season. It showed during
the season series with Buffalo,
when New Jersey goaltenders
allowed only seven goals in
four games.

On offense, the Devils do not
have many overpowering
forces, but a few guys who pro-
vide steady, consistent produc-
tion.

Stephane Richer and Scott
Stevens will be the two players
to watch out for in this series.
Stevens is an underrated play-
maker and will figure in on sev-
eral New Jersey goals.

Richer was a streaky player
this season, but turned it
up a notch against the Sabres,
scoring three goals and two
assists.

The Sabres are a hurtin’
bunch, with an injured Pat
LaFontaine riding the pine for
this series. Goal-scoring phe-
nom Alexander Mogilny will
have to make some serious
tracks if the Sabres hope to be
playing hockey in May. Other

than Mogi1ny’s offense, the only
other thing that Buffalo has to
rely on is the goaltending of
Dominik Hasek.

Hasek showed more than a
few ﬂashes of greatness this
season, but is a largely untested
playoff performer (other than
his stint in the Cup finals as a
Blackhawk), and was battered
around by the Devils this year.
He will not be able to save the
Sabres, who will be lucky to
score ten goals in this series.
DeviL9 infive.

#4 Boston Bruins vs. #5
Montreal Canadiens

There is no playoff team more
beaten up than the boys from
Beantown. Without Cam Neely,
whose 50-goal season surprised
everyone in the country, and
with Ray Bourque questionable,
the Bruins are a 747 with no
wings.

After the senseless trade of

center Joe Juneau to the .

Capitals for Al Iafrate, the
Bruins have no one to comple-
ment Adam Oates, one of the

 

league’s premier passers. ~

Oates may have to do a lot
of the work himself if
Bourque is out for any period of
time.

In goal, the matchup of the
Bruins’ Jon Casey versus the
Habs’ Patrick Roy could decide
the series.

Casey, who has always been a
streaky playoff performer, will
need to steal a few games for
the Bruins to have any hope of
winning this series.

His excellent performance in
net in Boston’s 5-2 win in game
one on Saturday was a good
start, but he will need a few
more of those for the Bruins to
win this series.

Roy on the other hand,
well, what else need be said.
With him in net, the Canadiens
always have a good chance
to win, as was demonstrated
by last year’s championship
run.

Roy and the Habs will have
the upper hand in this close
matchup.

Habs in seven.

They coasted to a first place fin-
ish with a time of 47.38

seconds. Robert Morris
took second with a time of
50.05.

Overall, this was a meet in
which the Lady Panthers
cleaned house, as they took 11
first-place finishes out of 17
events.

Another highlight was the
women’s 100-meter hurdles.
The Lady Panthers did what
they know best, sweeping the
competition.

Najuma Fletcher took first
with a time of 13.86. Suggs cap-
tured second with her time of
15.90. Mullins came in third
place with a time of 14.67 sec-
onds.

In the field events, Joanne
Warner was unbeatable as
she won the shot put, the discus
and the hammer throw.

While the women out—
matched their competition, the
men’s team also fared well. The
Panthers came away with six
first-place finishes despite com—

peting without some of their
key sprinters.

The focal point of the men’s
competition was the shuttle hur-
dle relay challenge between an
alumni hurdle relay team
and Pitt’s current relay team
composed of Jerel Williams,
Orel Green, Wes Alexander and
jay Murphy.

The team composed of the
present Panthers defeated
the alumni. The time was unof-
ficial.

The Panthers showed signs of
improvement in other events as
well.

Mike Lynn, a senior from
Lewistown, Pa., won the
steeplechase by over six sec-
onds in 9:26.

In the shot put, senior Jim
Monk won with a throw of
53 1-2 feet, and Brian Whitley
took first in the 400 meters
with a time of 48.26 seconds.

Alexander nipped teammate
Williams in the 400-meter hur-
dles in a photo finish at the

clocked at 52.51.
