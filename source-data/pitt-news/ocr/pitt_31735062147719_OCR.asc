Butler Criticizes
War As ‘Racket
For Wall Street’

“War Bound To Come In Europe,
But We Can Remain Neutral,”
Maj or-General Tells Forum

By Sydney Horovitz

“There is no use appealing to peo-
ple on the grounds that war is horri-
ble. Let us look at it as a racket in
the hands of VVall Street. Let us ask
ourselves: ‘Are we going to be used
up by Wall Street? Are we going to
swallow their slogans of keep the
world safe for democracy and a war
to end wars?’ ”

Major—Genera1 Smedley D. Butler
stood on the edge of the platform in
the Schenley High School auditorium
Wednesday evening and told Pitts-
burgh Inquiry Forum members that
he knows American youth has been
sacriﬁced to make the world safe for
some shares of stock, some oil wells,
and some investments of the DuPonts
and Morgans in foreign countries.

“In the last war we went to ﬁght
for democracy in alliance with the
Russian czar, one of the greatest
democratic rulers without a doubt,”
General Butler pointed out. “live were
told the war came as a result of bad
economic conditions. Then why did
it stop when conditions were a million
times worse? VVe were told it was
due to the presence of huge arma-
ments. Then why did it stop when
the greatest number of armaments
were collected and working at the end
of the war?”

Wars Forced By Bankers

“The answer is that wars are start-
ed to make a certain advantage for
bankers and investors who let it con-
tinue only as long as it beneﬁts them.
The powers sat down at a peace table
in Versailles and wrote a treaty which
they knew would bring on another
war. A small, struggling concern
named DuPont entered the war with
60 millions and came out of it with
658 millions.”

And don’t blame it on the soldiers;
the civil department is superior to
the military in the United States, ac-
cording to General Butler. “The

soldiers can do nothing but obey or-_

ders given to-“them~-by the.-president
who gets his from the big investors.
There’s another racket; did you ever
see a president drafted into service?”

Neutrality legislation is worth noth-
ing at all, the general insisted. “And
we can’t stay out of war by not sell-
ing lists of war implements because
everything is an implement of war.
International law is only human, like
the Supreme Court.”

Mr. Butler told that, just as Cali-
fornians look under their bed for Jap-
anese battleships, he was so afraid
the foreigners would come to Chester
County in this state after his mother
that he went down to Cuba.

“War is bound to come in Europe,
perhaps starting Asia; the only way

Women Debaters
Meet Ohio Team

Uphold Negative Of Court Topic
Against Denison U. Tonight

All the limelight will not be center-
ed on the College Association dance
tonight, some of it will be focused on
the ﬁrst intercollegiate women's de-
bate of the local season, scheduled to
begin at 7 o’clock in the Heinz House.

Three women from Denison Univer-
sity have arrived on campus to argue
with a University team on the ques-
tion “Resolved: that Congress should
have the power to over-ride: by a two-
thirds vote decisions of the Supreme
Court declaring acts of Congress un-
constitutional.” ‘

Ruth Shapiro, ‘C37, Elizabeth Glass,
Ed36, and Sarah Reish, Ed36, will de-
fend the negative side of the question
for the University.

Today at 12:30 o’clock there will be
an extension debate at the Shrine
Lunch Club in the Will-iam Penn Ho-
tel. The question to be argued is the
same as the one tonight, but both
sides will be defended by a Univer-
sity team. Jeannette Swartz, C38, and
Marcella Leyton, C37, will take the af-
ﬁrmative, opposing Miss Shapiro and
Gertrude Reich, C36.

This afternoon at 2:30 o’clock to-
night's team will have a preliminary
Dractice session with the Denison de-
baters.

Goldman To Lead
Band At Concert

Famous Selections Of Conductor
To Be Included On Program

Dr. Edwin Franko Goldman, nation-
ally known band director, will be the
guest conductor of the University
band at its home concert, to be given
in Carnegie Music Hall, April 29.

Dr. Goldman is well known for his
Goldman Band concerts “On the Mall”
in Central Park, New York City. He
is the composer of several band com-
positions which have become famous
the world over, During the past sev-
eral years he has been making tours
of the country as guest conductor of
prominent organizations

Last fall the famous conductor
came to Pittsburgh to direct the com-
bined city high school bands at the
high school championship football
game at the Stadium.

‘Last year, due to the reorganiza-
tion of the band, the home concert

-. was omitted from the regular ~sched- 

ule of the 120-piece organizajtion. The
program this year will probably in-
clude several of the more famous
numbers of the guest conductor.

‘In preparation for the concert, the
University band will appear on March
13 at Schenley High School for the
student assembly, and for a similar
gathering at Scott High School, North
Braddock, on March 24.

Student admission to the concert
will be through student book tickets
which will be exchanged for regular
tickets during the week of April 6.

1936 Owl Is Scheduled
For Early May Debut

Adorned with a specially-designed
cover, showing the Belleﬁeld Avenue
entrance of the Cathedral, the 1936
Owl will make its campus debut some-
time early in May.

The leather cover was designed
from an unusual photograph by Luke
Swank, University photographer. The
background of the cover will be the
stonework of the Cathedral.

In the center of the front cover, the
stonework of the entrance will extend
from the top to the bottom of‘ the
page. Between the arches of the en-
trance, the words “1936 Owl” will be
stamped in large blue letters.

Student subscriptions are now be-
ing solicited by undergraduate Owl
agents, on a convenient installment

Laidler To Speak
At Forum Monday

“Which Way America?” Topic
Of Campus Talk By Economist

As its first project, the Student-Fac-
ulty Association Forum Committee
will bring Dr. Harry W. Laidler, ex-
ecutive director of the League for In-
dustrial Democracy, to campus on
Monday at 2:30 o’clock. He will speak
on, “Which Way America.”

Dr. Laidler will address an open
forum "of students and faculty at
Heinz House on the same subject
which he will use at the Pittsburgh
Community Forum, Monday evening,
at Schenley High School.

Dr. Laidler is recognized as a lead-
ing economist, and is author of sev-
eral books on economics, including
“Concentration in American Indus-
try.” He has been connected withthe
League for Industrial Democracy
since its inception, being one of the
founders.

The SFA Forum Committee, which
is sponsoring the meeting, is made
up of Charles Herald, C36, chairman;
Leonard Seder, C37 ; Betty Wain-
wright, C37; Howard Lutz, C36; and
Robert D. Ayars, professor and head
of the department of accounting.
According to Herald, there will be,
a complete discussion following Dr.
Laidler’s talk, and sufficient time is
being provided to enable all questions
to be answered. “The lack of time
sufficient to answer all questions is
the feature lacking in other groups on
campus, and this is a need we are try-
ing to ﬁll,” Herald concluded.

Social Workers Plan
Campus Organization

Social Service Committee Scheduled
To Meet Today at Heinz House

Plans for a new club on campus, to
include students interested in volun-
teer social work, were discussed by
the Social Service Committee at a
meeting Tuesday.

Up to this time the Social Service
Committee has been the only organ-
ization for volunteer workers at the
University, but it is felt that the
group is too limited and inadequate
to accommodate the needs of all stu-
dents.

A committee was chosen to draw up
a constitution which will be submit-
ted to SFA. The group includes:
Mary Pallaye, C37 ; Alberta Russell,
C36; Adele Norkus, Ed36; Ruth
Sharpe, Ed37; Sylvia Schwartz, C38;
and Minette Cohen, C37.

A meeting of the Social Service
Committee will be held today at 12:30
o’clock at Heinz House. All members
are urged to be present.

This Isn’t A Paper From Last November;

The Same Thing Happens Again Tonight

Lead Man Again

Paul Keiser

RESIDENT of the College Associa-

tion, whose arduous task of leading
dances continues another time to-
night. Cabinet members of the Asso-
ciation. after tonight's 9 to 1 formal,
will count up receipts which eventu-
: ly go to the loan fund.

I The pictures are the same, the
dance is the same, the price is the
same, and only the date and place are
different, as the second College Asso-
ciation formal of the wear swings in-
to action at 9 o’clock tonight.

It’s at the Hotel Schenley this
time, but the price is a one dollar bill,
and Paul Keiser will lead the same
mythical grand march with the same
girl, Beverley Brown, C37.

But in one way this dance is dif-
ferent. Every cent of the proﬁts will
go into the College Association loan
fund, a fund which right now is seri-
ously depleted. This fund makes loans
of up to $50 to needy students. In the
past years, dance receipts have been
turned back to the general fund,
from which a sum has been allocated
at the end of each year for loaning
purposes.

Jimmy Bray’s orchestra will play
tonight, as the only other change
from the Thanksgiving formal. This
affair marks a change in the College
Association policy, since the formal
dance in the second semester has
been shifted to ﬁrst, with the informal
dance to come later in the year.

Tickets will remain on sale all day
in the office of the college, Room 205,
State Hall, in the office of the dean
of men, Room 801, Cathedral, and
with members of the College Associa-
tion Cabinet,

ples are expected to dance along with

room. Jimmy Bray’s 10-piece orches-

tra will play for the formal.

Druids To Honor
 Tappees March 9

 

Mid-Winter Recognition Of New
Men To Feature Dance

Druids, national sophomore honor-
ary fraternity, will hold a tea dance
on the afternoon of Monday, March 9,
at which newly-elected members will
be tapped,‘and to which women will
be admitted free of charge.

This was decided at a meeting yes-
terday afternoon, following tentative
action ‘by the executive and social
committees, according to Frank Engel,
E38, president.

An unstated number of ﬁrst se-
mester sophomores, who were elected
Sunday, will be admitted iuto the or-
g-anization.

The anticipated change in the meth-
ods by which Druids elect new mem-
bers was made in the meeting Sunday.
The maximum number of Druids, un-
der the new constitution, has been
raised to 21, with no more than 15
men to be tapped during Spring Fes-
tival Week by an entirely new proce-
dure. Active in initiating this change
which, according to Engel, will “re-
move the last remnant of politics from
our organization,” were: Andrew Mot-
fett, C38; Jackson Sigmon, C38; Her-
bert Rackoff, C38; David Grossman,
C38; Engel, and James Dattillo, C38.

Pitt Men Attend
Aluminum’s 50th
Year Celebration

Representing the University at the
celebration of the ﬁftieth anniversary
of creation of the aluminum industry
were Dr. Alexander Silverman, head
of the University department of
chemistry, and Dr. E. R. Weidlein, di-
rector of the Mellon Institute.

Held at Oberlin, Ohio, scene of. the
discovery of the process, the celebra-
tion included a wide program of
events which served as a memorial
to the achievements of Charles W.
Hall, ﬁrst man to work successfully
with the electrolytic method of alum-
inum extraction.

Dr. Vveidlein, president-elect of the
American Chemical Society, spoke of
the importance of having industry
subsidize education and encourage the
student in his accomplishments.

Oberlin itself was almost a dis-
play case of the original apparatus
used by Hall and the results it cre-
ated. The entire town was decorated
with aluminum, even to show win-
dows of the stores. Covers of the pro-
grams were also made of aluminum.
After the luncheon, a student played
a solo on an aluminum violin which
gave forth tones that, as Dr. Silver-
man reported, were finer, on the low-
er notes, than those given by an or-
dinary wooden violin.

Delegates Meet

The Pitt delegation of the Intercol-
legiate Conference on Government
will meet on Sunday, at 2:30 o’clock,

One Hundred Forty-Nine

Today marks the one hundred and forty-ninth birthday
of the University. The alumni and faculty committee
have worked hard on plans for today’s Charter Day activ-
ities, but try as they have, it seems almost inevitable
that these proceedings will measure up to something of

a prologue for the super celebrations being planned for
next year’s sesquicentennial.

The round of activities today should not, however, be
any the less interesting and worthwhile. Likewise, the
host of “old grads” who return today should have a
happy time visiting again their alma mater. We are
anxious to extend our greeting to those in whom the
spirit of Pitt lives yet so strongly that they have come
to take part in the celebration.

One hundred forty-nine years seems like a long time;
it is only when in our mind’s eye we place the tiny build-
ing that was: once our school beside the Cathedral that
we consider that development period short indeed. It is
the alumni who are here today who can vouch that the
spirit that is Pitt’s and the aims that are Pitt’s have
kept pace with the physical growth of the school.

The alumni have been of great help to the University.
They have given us the Hall which bears their name and
they have contributed much to the building of the Cathe-
dral. For their efforts, for their services, and for the
loyalty which remains strong in them for the Univer-
sity, we welcome and bid Godspeed to those who gather
today to mark the University’s one hundred and forty-
ninth birthday.

Personal note to our ﬁag~raising janitor, who may per-
haps pick up this paper from the ﬂoor: Uncle Sam prob-
ably won't mind, but after this when you put a flag at
half-mast you'd better run it to the top of the pole and
lower it to half-mast, not just raise it half-way as we un-
derstand you did Monday.

Dances featuring phonograph music are proving very
popular at Alfred University. In fact, it might be per-
missible to say that they are attracting record crowds.

Disclaim all responsibility for protec-

Panel Discussion On Court
Given By Graduates, Debaters

 

By William Stark

At a special meeting of Inquiry Forum Wednesday,- a panel discussion
was held on “Should we limit the power of the Supreme Court?”
ticipating were Dr. Roger V. Shumate, instructor in political science, chair-
man; Edwin P. Banks, graduate assistant in political science; Sarah Reish,
C36, president of the Women's Debating Association; Frank Doeringer, C36,
co-manager of the Men’s Debating Association; Albert Brandon, C36, member

Those par-

of the Men’s Debating Association; Marcella Leyton, C37, member of the I

Women's Debating Association; and Ruth Shapiro, C37, also a debater.

Speaking ﬁrst, ‘Banks said, “I do¢

 

AC/zoosegyour écmé

asyozz would c/more afrz'e72a'

not think that we need a third legis-
lative body to check on the other two.
Wha.t we ought to do is take away
the power of the Supreme Court to
hand down decisions on acts of Con-
gress—let them rule on state laws,
and give them the hpeciﬁc jurisdic-
tion mentioned in the Constitution. I
personally feel,” he continued, “that
as long as we maintain our federal
system of government, we will have
to keep the Supreme Court.”

Miss Shapiro said: “I should be
deﬁnitely opposed to giving Congress
the power to over-ride decisions of
the Supreme Court declaring acts of
Congress unconstitutional. I feel
that the ‘Court is more aloof from pol-
itics, and less inclined to be inﬂu-
enced by politics than is our Con-
gress."

Miss Leyton was, to some extent, in
agreement with Miss Shapiro in that
she also felt that the Court is above
politics to a far greater extent than
is Congress. She added further, “the
Constitution is really a body of basic
principles, and laws are merely addi-
tions to these basic principles. Also,
these laws tend to be formed by
groups. Therefore, I suggest the
abolition of the Court's power of
judicial review, but the continuation
of the Constitution as it is.”

Brandon Defends States’ Rights

Brandon then rose to the “defense"
of states’ rights with the statement,
“If the Court is given the power to
check state laws, the states will tend
to lose certain of their powers. “But,”
he added, “I personally have little
faith in the States’ ability to settle
great economic questions. I feel that
the Federal system will abolish itself
with the increased centralization of
national power that will come from
giving the Court power to check
State laws.”

Doeringer countered with the state-
ment, “In America today, we do not
control our representatives, in that
we have no choice in their selection.
We merely cast votes for them, and
then try to control them after they
are in office. The fundamental essen-
tial of democracy is the ultimate con-
trol of policy resting in the hands
of the people. We can get this con-
trol to a greater degree by a more ex-
tensive use of the convention in the
ratiﬁcation of amendements.”

“Furthermore,” he continued, “We
should keep the Supreme Court in its
present structure, on the condition of
more extensive use of the convention.

same light as the Court, as is evi-
denced by the fact that steering com-
mittees and whips prepare the “stamp-
ing machines” far in advance of the
actual vote on any measure.”

Panther Cagers Battle Tech
In Important League Clash

 

Victory Over Temple Five Allows Carlsonmen To Tighten
Race In Eastern Intercollegiate Conference

VVith the title race of the Eastern
Intercollegiate Conference at its hot-
test point of the season, Pitt’s Pai1-
ther basketball team moves over to
Carnegie Tech’s gym tomorrow

night to battle the Skibos in the most-

important cage clash of the confer-
ence schedule.

In the ﬁrst meeting of the Panthers
and Scotchmen this season, Tech pull-
ed the unexpected and also a brilliant
last half rally to nose out the Cats
by ﬁve points, 34-29. That was the
night when little Buzzy Greenberg,
in his debut as a starter for the Tech
five, pulled the game out of the ﬁre
for the Tartans with his 14 timely
points.

This season Coach Max Hannum
has put out Tech’s best varsity cage
team since the institution took up
basketball. They dropped two games
to Duquesne and two in the confer-
ence, but they have one of those
teams that never gives up. Hannum,
for a change, has a number of good
players.

They are: Captain Joe Macalka at
one of the forwards, Who invariably
plays a good game, towering Fitzwil-
son at center, Babe Patt, a forward
who clicked 15 points off at Temple’s
expense the other night, energetic
Buzzy Greenberg, Billy Gibson, who
teams with Macalka as a. forward,
Hugh James, the tallest center in the
city, Lou Jagnow, and ﬁnally Felser,
sub-guard, who was high-point man
against the Dukes Tuesday night with
his ten points.

Tickets for the Pitt—Tech clash can
be had at the Stadium ticket office
by presenting a student book and 42
cents. The game will start at 8
o’clock, while a preliminary between
the Little Panthers and the Tech
Frosh will start at 7 o’clock.

Panthers’ Big Rally
Tops Owls, 52-41

It took the Panther cage team ex-
actly six minutes and 40 seconds to
get going Wednesday night at the Sta-
dium against the Temple basketball
team but once they found out just
where Frank Mecca's crew placed the
basket on the bankboard, it was all
over for the Owl ﬂock from Philadel-
phia.

At the end of the game, the score-
board showed the Panthers pluckins
52 feathers from the Owl while Tem-
ple had to be content with 41 pieces
of fur from the Panther’s skin.

All in all, it was one of the most
important victories of the season for
the Panther team, for besides giving
the Cats a clean sweep of the season
series _with the Owls, it placed the
Pitt boys in possession of the second
place position in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Conference.

It was just Temple’s luck to run in-
to the Panthers when three of the Pitt
boys were “on.” Billy Jesko, Ted Ro-
derick, and Joe Garcia had most of the
say in ruling the Owls virtually out of
the title race. Jesko ﬂashed ten
points, Roderick 12, and Garcia 11,
to share scoring honors for the Cats.

Temple started off well enough,
with Bloom counting two ﬁeld goals,
and Casper and Dubin one each in the
ﬁrst six minutes to put the Owls out
in front, 8-0. Then Rags Radvansky
slid in a foul to light the spark for the
Pittsburgh team. Once started, the
Panthers crept up on the Owls and
ﬁnally knotted the count at 18-all late
in the ﬁrst period. ,

That was the last time the Temple
team had a look—in. In the ﬁnal three
minutes of the opening half the
Panthers kept on and were going away
as the gun boomed at half-time, 26-19.

The second half was more or less
a repetition of the ﬁnal nine minutes
of the ﬁrst period. Roderick and Gar-
cia popped them in from all angles,
with Roderick doing most of his point-
making from the foul line. Radvan-
sky, until he left the game on person-
als, made his share of baskets, too.

One bright spot of the evening f01'
the Philadelphia team was the bril-
liant play of the towering center,
Maury Bloom. Six baskets and three
fouls were Mr. Blooni’s contribution
to the Temple cause.

Trackers Primed
For AMA Meet

Coach Olson Enters Strong Team
In Tomorrow’s District Event

Marching into the third successive
home meet of the indoor season, a
band of the combined frosh and var-
sity squads matches strides with the
top-notchers in the tri-state district,
tomorrow, at 10 o’clock in the Senior
AMA championships.

As in the University invitations,
the opening meet of the season, the
Panthers are favored again to domi-
nate in a majority of the events. This
should be even more a Pitt event
since event No. 2, The Pitt News
Olympic beneﬁt, was tucked success-
fully under their belts two weeks ago.

Then too, the relay quartet, and
Pete Bennett, John Vvoodruff, Glenn
Cooper, Dick Mason, and S01 Menaker
have the added advantage of “big-
time” competition in at least one of
the group of national events, includ-
ing the Millrose Games, Michigan Re-
lays, and National AAU champion-
ships.

Connelly, ‘Groat Renew Duel

Coach Olson pronounces Charles
Groat and Harold Connelly in excel-
lent shape for the test that should
prove just who rules the indoor half-
mile. In their last duel, these two
were well on their way to a new rec-
ord until a disastrous spill on the
ﬁnal curve spoiled this feature race
of the Olympic beneﬁt.

Groat set the outdoor standard last
June, with Connelly the present pos-
sessor of the indoor mark in the 880-
yard run. Connelly holds a decision
over the loose-running Groat, register-
ed in the University invitations, but
this was early in the season and
neither was pronounced ﬁt for 3. rec-
ord-breaking effort. .

‘Biff Glassford, varsity football
guard, reported for practice Tuesday,
and has been really doing things with
that 16—pound ball. On his second
day out, Biff‘, heaved the shot 41 feet,
seven inches. Only Gene Taano, with
a mark of 42 feet, three inches, bet-
tered Glassford’s mark in the daily

squad trials.
Glassford’s appearance- offers an-
other threat in the senior weight

throw tomorrow, with Charley Gong-
loff the ruling favorite to repeat his
victory scored in the University invi-
tations.

Woodruff To Run Mile

Red Tost will be seriously handi-
capped in the mile as the result of
a leg injury sustained earlier in the
week. Johnny Woodruff, yearling ace,
may compete in both the mile and
half runs and therefore will rate seri-
ous consideration before either title
is decided.

Glenn Cooper stands a. good‘ chance
of upsettring Dick Mason and S01
Menaker in the sprints. Ken Ryden
looks good as another “long shot”
against Andy Lasky, junior, in the
hurdles. Lasky holds the varsity rec-
ords, with Ryden owning even better
marks on the freshman boards.

Loungers Leave,
Ping Pong Stars
Invade Room 817

Beginning Monday, those who have
been accustomed to spending hours
of quiet relaxation in the newly es-
tablished men’s lounge rooms will
have to dig up a new hideout. VVith
the click of the celluloid ball re-
sounding throughout Room 817, Ca-
thedral, the lounge retreat will be no
place to try to pass a peaceful after-
noon.

The room will be jammed next week
with a brigade of 74 celluloid-clouters,
ping-pong pulverizers or whatever ap-
propriate adjectives could be used to
describe the gentlemen who will bat-
tle across the table for the second an-
nual University Table Tennis cham-
pionship.

Preparations have been completed

by the collaborators, Martin J. Feely,
director of intramural athletics, and
Irwin Solow, sophomore champion,
who last year not only instigated the
competition but went on to win its
title.
' Here’s the ﬁnal dope: (1)
for entries is positively 5 o’clock this
afternoon, (2) Pairings‘ and time for
play will be posted on the bulletin
board of the ﬁrst ﬂoor, Cathedral of
Learning, on Monday morning, (3)
All ﬁrst round matches will be played
on Monday except those who do not
have any Monday hours open.

If enough promising material is
unearthed in the tourney, a. team will
be selected for play in the Pittsburgh
Table Tennis League, co-chairman
Solow revealed today. This league
includes teams from the North Side
Community House, two of whose
members are ranked among the top
ﬂight in Vvestern Pennsylvania ping-
pong circles.

Natators Meet Cadet
Swimmers Tomorrow

Coach Corr's varsity swimming
team leaves this evening at 9:30
o’clock for West Point, New York,
where it will clash with Army’s
powerful water outﬁt tomorrow after-
noon in a dual struggle. ‘ -M A ‘ 

Accompanying Coach Corr and
Manager James Nelson were Captain
Russ Lindberg, Tom Locke, Harry
Geyer, Bob Anderson. John Stira.nko,
Red McQuillan, and Jim Lavine.

Corr will use Lindberg in the
"sprints, Locke and Lavine in the dis-
tance events, Anderson in the breast-
stroke, McQuillan in the diving, and
Stiranko in the backstroke.

The Army boasts of one of the
strongest swimming teams in the
East, and a victory by the Panthers
over the Cadets would be regarded as
a.n upset.

Boxers Win, Wrestlers Lose

In _Ee_uts With Owl Teams

Sluggers Display Class!
In Beating Temple;
Leonard Stars

It was a grand evening Wednesday
night at the Stadium for the Panther
boxing team. It wasn’t such a grand
evening for the wrestling outﬁt. In
short, the Panther mittmen licked the
stufﬁng out of the Temple boys, 61,/:_,
to 1%, but the Owl wrestlers, in turn,
rolled the wrinkles out of the Panther
grunt-and-groaners by a lopsided 27-3
count.

Altogether it was quite a sport at-
traction with boxing, basketball, and
wrestling all taking a share of the
liilleliglli. Boxing opened the evening
but from the looks of things, the Owl
Sluggers must have had their punch
spiked from the very beginning. -

However, most of the matches were
close, with the Panthers marking up
their 6% points by three decision
wins, two Temple forfeits, a technical
knockout, and a draw. Captain Al Pas-
lowski, Ray Tomarell-i, and George
Dines went the three rounds for vic--
tories by decision.

In the best bout of the evening Art
Leonard showed real ﬁghting class in
gaining a technical knockout over
Temple’s Leo Leibovitz in the second
round. Leonard had the Owl slugger
in a bad way in the ﬁrst round, then
Leibovitz came out strong in the sec-
ond, only to be smacked down for the
long count.

Heinz House; the time, next W'ed-
nesday at 12:30 o'clock; and the
admission, exactly nothing.

old soup kitchen style and each
guest will advance down the line
while Ruth Thielman, C, and her
social committee pass out the “vit-
tles.”

Spring is here: Perhaps not official-
ly, but in practice, at least, for in the
spring a young man’s fancy lightly
turns to thoughts of love. And almost
half of the fraternity news this week
consists of announcements of mar-
riages and engagements,

The lull in the social activities of
the fraternities brought on by the
rushing season will soon be over as
the actives prepare to entertain their
new pledges, and the pledge groups
in return undertake to fete the ac-
tives. With the start of the open bid-
ding season, many new names will be
added to the pledge lists in addition
to those officially released by the of-
ﬁces of the deans of men and women
this week.

Women Rushees
Pick Fraternities

All Who Receive Bids Must Turn
In Ballots At Heinz House Today

Fraternity women are watchfully
eyeing rushees, who are climbing the
steps of Heinz House this morning to
hand i11 their ballots.

Although women who received bids
hand in their ballots before 9:30
o’clock, fraternity women wait until
7 o’clock this evening before names
of new pledges are released. At that
time representatives from each group
will receive their pledge lists at the
University Club.

‘However, silence week does not end
until tomorrow at noon. It is not un-
til that hour that rushees know
whether the fraternity of their choice
has bid them. Neophiytes receive of-
ficial notice of their group affiliation
through the group itself.

As a result of ribbon services, which
are usually held on Sunday, frater-
nity colors will be worn by neophytes
beginning Monday. Formal pledge
service will be held on Monday eve-
ning when former rushees will be-
come pledges.

From March 9 until the end of the
semester, open biding is permitted.

Over a period of years, certain basic advances have been made in the
selection ond treotmentofcigorette ioboccos for Lucky Strike Cigarettes.
They include preliminary analyses of the tobaccos selected; use of
center leaves; the higher heat treatment of tobacco ("toasting"); con-
sideroiion of acid-alkaline balance, with consequent deﬁnite improve-
ment in ﬂavor; and controlled uniformity in the finished product.
All these combine to produce a superior cigc:retie—o modern cig-

arette, a cigarette made of rich, ripe-bodied tobaccos—A Light Smoke.
