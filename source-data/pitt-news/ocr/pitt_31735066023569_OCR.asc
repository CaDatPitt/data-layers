Discussion On Women's Studies Major Tabled by CAS Council

By TERESA SOKOL
-57‘ ~ Pitt News Staff Writer
'- The “College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) Council tabled
discussion about the develop-
ment of a major in the area of
Women’s Studies, until further
research can be done by the
5 Council. «

Women’s Studies is also
asking for a new certiﬁcation
procedure. Currently, to. re-
ceive a certiﬁcate, a student
must have 15 credits in the area
of Women’s Studies. The
program is asking that this
credit number be increased to
18, according to Cynthia
Sutherland, associate professor

the Women’s Studies Program.
Since 1975, Sutherland
‘noted, the number of com-
pleted certificates is 54 with 39
on ﬁle, she added, “this is the
closest you can get to a major
now.” - .
Women’s Studies, therefore,
has developed an interdisci-
plinary major in this area to
propose to the CAS Council,
she said. ‘ I
“Interdisciplinary means .
that Women’s. Studies ,will
concentrate some of its require-
ments in recognized major
disciplines such as english and
psychology‘, ’ ’ Sutherland
added. ‘

sities across the nation, such as
UCLA and Temple, have
developed a Women’s Studies
major, shesaid. ,-

The major would have
women as the primary focus

' and would develop a sophisti-
cated method to analyze the
study of women, according to '
Sutherland. __ -

“We are looking for cohe-
siveness and quality of teach-
ing method and we are
-convinced Women’s Studies is
a discipline,” she said.

Dean Irwin ‘J. Schulman
agreed that there is “a kind of
white male p-arochialism” in
learning, but questioned whe-

become a major for CAS.

Sutherland claimed that the
interdisciplinary nature of the
major would avoid this and any
other charges that the major.
would become an “intellectual
ghetto” separate from other
areas of studies at the
university.

Professor and Council mem-
ber Ian Campbell also ques-
tioned whether Women’s Stud-
ies could be considered a major
discipline. He referred to a
major as a “discipline that
stands independant of the
people (in the department)”
and cited biology as an

CAS Council noted that the
University acknowledges tight-
er disciglines such as biology,
for majors, andusually gives
certiﬁcates in interdisciplinary
areas. '

In other academic areas,
CAS Council approved a
change in the new business
major. Tenative plans now call
for a curriculum of 52 credits
with nine credits of electives in
courses approved by the
business school, but not
necessarily in economics,’ as
previously decided.

CAS Councilalso approved a

who is chairing the task force.

The questions now seem tobe
how much of an increase, and when
this increase should "come into

hopefully we won’t need to change

noted. ‘

The increase would leave more
money for small groups, ‘DeMatteo
said. However, she cautioned that

Park added that Pitt's fee was "
“ridiculously low” and that an,
increase could be a definite help
toward increasing student services

With the end of the term less than a month away,
most Pitt students have lost sight of anything for
which they could be thankful. The pressures, of_
upcoming finals and papers blot-out any moment of
happiness like a full eclipse of the sun. The little
news from outside the tedium of ‘ reading and
researching has done little to alleviate the gloom
surrounding the end of the term. Every day students
are bombarded with the frustrating conflicts between
the United States and Iran, depressing reports about
spiralling inﬂation and pessimisticprophecies about
high unemployment among college graduates. _

Thanksgiving Day almost seems to be a cruel joke
to students who feel overburdened with studies and
other work. For the cynics among ‘these,
Thanksgiving is a four-day vacation when they can
escape cafeteria food for home cooking and catch up
on the school work that they have been neglecting-
since their mid-terms. This holiday means little to
such hard-hearted people besides the chance to
escape from Oakland for a few days and see their

' family and a few friends.

Remembering the reason for Thanksgiving can
help to fight the gloom and cynicism that pervades _
among students during the end of the semester.

Page 4—‘—Wednesday, November 21, 1975 I

Above all, this holiday should be a time to see the
past year in perspective, recalling the good times that
outweigh everyday matters of drudgery and troubles.
It is these times on which we must focus to show
ourselves that life has not been as bad as it sometimes
seems to be.. These moments of happiness are not
large and grandiose, but are timesthat prove there is
some good in the world despite the misery that
abounds. A friendly wave and a hello, or helping a'
senior citizen off a bus, are some of tho‘§€
unimportant acts that are often ignored, but in the
end are the ones most needed to make life bearable.
It is these things we must think about during this
holiday. ‘

Thanksgiving also gives students a chance to catch
their breath and look to the future. After this
holiday only a short time remains before the semester
is over and students must prepare themselves for a
new semester of studies, or a new step into the world

" beyond the university. The future offers to those
brave enough to seek it a chance for new experiences

and new .opportunities. Perhaps this Thanksgiving is
also atime of challenge when everyone should be
thankful for the good of the past and hopeful about
the promise of the future. Q

All things considered, it is safe to
assess that the grim prospect of
war with Iran is beginning to loom
clearly in the face of the United
States. To make this and my
following statements clear and
justified. I will brieﬂy summarize
the Iranian crisis and the events
which led up ’to it.

Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the
shah of Iran, was supported by
President Carter. Early in 1979

’ Pahlavi was overthrown in a violent

revolution, to be replaced by a
Regency ‘Council type of govern-
ment. Shortly after, Mehdi_ Bazar-
gan became Iran's Prime Minister,
and the Ayatollah Rudollah Kho-
meini gained much inﬂuence in
Iran. In the revolution Pahlavi was
not killed, because he fled to the
United States where he now
remains. Less than four weeks ago
Bazargan was ousted from power,
to be replaced by a provisional
government. Around this time a
group of anti-shah, pro-Khomeini
Iranian students laid seige to the
U.S. embassy in their country.
demanding that the deposed shah
be returned to Iran so that he could
be killed there.

While important political ﬁgures
such as Connally, Kennedy and
Kissinger mull over possible

I. solutions to the crisis of the

Americans being held at the

. . _';'_‘$_'._‘',_a . l_ l:  .w_._ -W,

   

public attitude in our country of
dislike toward Iranian people. I
have seen graffiti stating messages

suc_h_as_ “Death to_ the _Ira_nia11,

pigs” and “Kill Iranian students,”
and have been utterly appalled.
Not only are these attitudes ones of
“war hysteria,” to quote the Inter-
national Committee Against Ra-
cism, but they lack justiﬁcation as
well. The group of Iranians who are
holding the hostages are using
terrorist tactics to get what they
want. In a column appearing in the
Pittsburgh Press on November 9,
Carl T. Rowan quotes a group of
Iranian student leaders and teach‘-
ers as saying, “A mistake (was
made) not in overthrowing the shah
but in supporting Khomeini.”
“Khomeini must go!” said an
Iranian in a letter which cited “the
gross abuses of human rights, the
tramplings of political freedom, the
executions, the jailings that have
taken place since Khomeini gained
power.” Mr. Rowan quotes one
Iranian student as saying, “We
didn't protest, stay in exile,
endanger our relatives in Iran for
years, just to replace the shah with
a religious tyranny. We were

fighting for democracy, personal

liberty, free speech.” All of this
proves that the Ayatollah is not
popular in Iran, and that freedom is

twhat the Iranian people‘ want.
to eradicate the. _‘

 In orde.r

-,t

 

_ Union. ..»so it is __....not

unhealthy attitude of war hysteria, ,

the crisis must be isolated. We are
a democratic nation and ‘must
support freedom as do the Iranians
mentioned by Mr. Rowan. We
must oppose the fanatical, ana-
chronistic, right-wing Ayatollah
and the terrorist tactics used by his
followers at the embassy. These
terrorists and the Ayatollah are
interfering with the opportunity for
Iran and the U.S. to have friendly
relations. This is the crisis which
must be isolated from the normal
Iranianway of life. We must not
hate the Iranian people, for they
are freedom-loving people just as
we are. It is wrong to condemn and
deport Iranian studentsin the U.S.

because of a crisis which they did‘

not-cause. They do not support the
oppressive Ayatollah. They are not

terrorists as are the people "at the

embassy. It is a terrible animosity
to denounce the Iranian people, but
that is exactly what is being done
here, and this is the kind of attitude
which leadsto war. We must not let
this happen.

As I have mentioned before, Iran
now has a provisional government.
which is not the moststable kind. If
the United States were to declare
war on Iran, to whom would Iran
turn for protection? No doubtthe
Soviet Union. At two northern
points Iran touches the Soviet
difficult to

alliance could win the war. The
Soviets would most likely be eager
to be on Iran’s side because that is
where the oil is, and the Soviets
have less oil now than they did in
recent years. ' . ' ,

I once again warn that we‘ must
stop this attitude of war hysteria.
We mustrecognize the crisis and

"support Iranian freedom rather

than thevshah-—he was the original
reasonfor the need for a struggle
-for freedom.

Anger In

In Arka Kargodorian’s letter in

he states that certain Pitt students
are taking advantage of the current
situation in Iran to let off some
steam and frustrations. He also
engages in some (by now) usual
sniping at America. .

He apparently feels that Ameri-

American hostages are being held

Pitt News Staff Writer

Despite a 4-9-2 record the 19-79 -

1+“  Pitt soccer team_can still have an

optilmisticv outlook_for the future of

 Panther soccer.

There is no looking ahead for a
better record for seniors and

vi 9-cocaptains, Tom Liebenguth and

1 Jeff Tissue.

-'

.\

Both Liebenguth, a

sweeperback, and Tissue, a wing,
along with midﬁelders Danny
Hamm and freshman Tom
Trempus, were recently awarded
an honorable mention in the
tallying of the all-star team for the
Western Pennsylvania Intercol-
legiate Soccer Conference.

the

Tissue was chosen by

Pittsburgh Spirit’s as one of their
six draftees in 1979 Major Indoor
Soccer League draft.

In 1979 the Panthers were ﬁlled
with a ‘number of transitions that
eventually took their toll on the
team's ﬁnal record. ‘

The Panthers never were able to

become accustomed to the big
sweep of ﬁrst year players. Only 10
veterans returned for the 1979
season. Johnny O‘Hara and Karl
Nigh, two players of the 1978
season, became members of the
Pennsylvania Stoners of the Amer-
ican Soccer League. With the
eligibility of these two gone, Pitt
coach Leo Bemis was forced to

and got my second wind and started picking off people.”

The runners’ splits were 9.:28.(two-mile), 14:31 (three-mile),

one Tough Spiker

“‘ By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt News Staff Writer

Dominating is a word often used
in describing an athlete. Cindy
Chambers, a senior middle blocker
and captain of the Pitt women's
volleyball team is dominating...
and aggressive...and a leader...
and...well, there’s no need to go

‘ on.

Chambers is the. team captain .-

and has played volleyball since she
was age 14, but said she doesn’t

even consider her play prior to '

college as real volleyball.

Since she started college, the
biology major has seen quite a bit
of the United States through
national and international competi-
tion. Besides competing against a
national team from Poland with the
Pantherettes, Chambers has
played with an all-star team from
the east which competed at the

Colorado Springs National Sports

Festival (like a mini‘-olympics) held
two summers ago. '

That same year,. Chambers was
an alternate on the USA junior
national team. Last summer, [the
York native played with the
Pittsburgh Pacers who did a lot of
traveling, competing against teams
from Texas; California and Canada.
This season, she,‘ /along with the
rest of the Pantherettes made a_ trip
to California and3Hawaii.- ‘The - trip

received 1-much, lcritic,is'm.,,‘T;l1_j,e .

teams": critics— felt the Pantherettes
were, pundese-riving of V "such "a
“glamour trip’_’ 'a'.r'1‘di_“cot1'ld'n?t see

  ‘*1 l'earne"d.‘la eateries. ‘lot-‘about

my position on. that. trip',”T“said

.Cha'mb‘e”rs.' "“We jwerje ,*r-playing

teams .of. the” best ....caliber '.é_very
day.—top 10 teams.:.It:-was: just an

incredible experience.”  -

Chambers said she isn’t sure of

what she will do after graduation
this spring, but has many options
from which to choose.~ '

“I "may go to grad school and
apply for the graduate assistant
position with the team,” she said.
“I don’t know, I’d really like‘ to

continue playing, so I may go out to;

Los Angeles to play for a team
there.”
. I . . 3’
‘The senior said her" most
satisfying experiences came when

playingat Pitt because the team is .

so close. ~

‘_‘It’s rewarding to do it for the _

other players,” Chambers said.
,“The tours that we go on bring us

‘ even closer together and it really.
_. feelsigood to 'give’Tsomething back. .
.. to the’coach,(Mike Hebert) who has«

given us so much.” ‘ — . 

Coach Hebert doesn’t hold back

when describing Chambers, who’

he has referred to as one of the
most dominating players in college
volleyball. i

“Cindy has a spiking efﬁciency
(which is the total number of spikes
divided into the number of kills,
minus thenumber of ‘errors) of
about 30 percent,” said Hebert.

He added that a good spiking

efﬁciency is 25 percent, therefore ‘

Chambers’ is excellent."

While the middle blocker has
seen her share of good times
including the Colorado Springs

National Sports Festival, which she '

described as both thrilling and
beautiful, there .have been disap-
pointments. '

“The worst is when we play
teams that I know we should beat,
but don’t because we beat

ourselves,” she said. “It’s just"

mainly when we don’t play up to
par. As high as the highs are, there
are lows to equal them, but thank
goodness the highs outnumber the
lows.“

Chambers said she does see
herself in the role of a leader, being
captain of the team. She added that
because of her experience, she
50.65 -feel more dominating.

‘ ‘fWhen the team is down or in
trouble,” she said, “I have to pull
through ‘and be sure not to‘make
any errors’. I can’t make any errors
being in the leader’s role.T"

 major difference between
the. Pantherettes and 1-many other
volleyball teams is the ability of the
P,itt,,,,spikers to, have a good time
when ;they are out on the court,
while.‘.rnany other teams treat the

game . like a business.

_ 1 ‘‘‘Our team plays best.when there
. is no worry, when things are

clicking,” said Chambers. “We’re
a real fun‘ team, talking and
laughing all the time. In fact, when

p ewe.are talking and laughing, the

other team usually gets quiet and I
think it intimidates them.”

9 ‘With Pitt now preparing for

nationals in less than two weeks, all
the spikers’ minds are on improv-

ing on last years’_ 13th place ﬁnish. -

“I think we can ﬁnish in the top
eight (out of 16),” said Chambers.
“We’ll have to put in a lot of hard
work and ﬁnish first or second in
our bracket. Ithink we can do it as
long as we play heads up ball.”

If Chambers and the rest of the
Pantherettes continue to play the
way (they did last week at the
eastern championships, that goal
may..not be as hard to achieve as it .
 seems." 7

mann’s talents were overlooked _in
the choices for the WPISC all-star
team selections. Hamm, Trempus
and newcomer Barry Stein will
make-up the rest of the midﬁeld.

Finishing—it could be said in
one short term. One of the biggest
factors in the 1979 season was the
Panther’s inability to put the ball in
the net. This was coupled with
inconsistent passing from the
defense and midﬁeld. Successful
offensive tactics were seldom
executed throughout the season.
The Panther midﬁeld and front line
had a hard time combining to put
together any scoring threats.
Lack of organization took its toll.

“We had a lot of problems
working together as one cohesive
unit,”-said Danny Hamm. “We
didn’t know each others styles
many times and it made for a lot of
confusion.”

‘ The Panthers front line was the
best example of player turnover.

' The only deﬁnite starter on the line

all season was\Tissue at left wing.
Bob Hughes saw the most action in
the center forward position where
his jumping and heading’ tech-
niques were called upon. Hughes
shared that position with two
freshman John Pizezella and Eric
Tiedtke. Tiedtke if not playing in

- the middle was moved to the right

wing. In that spot he shared a
starting role with Olabode Anise.

Between the newcomers and the
use of a number of players in both
the midﬁeld and the front line the
Panthers found it almost impossi-
ble to score. In 15 games that the
Panthers played a total of 12 goals

 

were scored. Tissue led the team
with ﬁve of those. Tiedtke was the
next highest with two goals. Three
players recorded 2 assists on
Panther goals; Adelmann, Anise,
and Buirge.

Defensively, the Panthers
sported their strongest point on the
field. The Pitt four were hampered
in the ﬁnal ﬁve games of the season
by a number of injuries. Outside
fullback Tom Kunkel was hit with a
badly pulled muscle five minutes
into the Penn State game and
didn’t see any action until the
ﬁnale with West Virginia. Just as
Kunkel moved back in Jerry
Tomasetti was taken out due to a
broken wrist suffered in an
inter-squad scrimmage.

- Those injuries left Tom Lieben
guth and Jim Hackworth as the
only healthyfullbacks. They were
assisted by two freshman, Karl
Heimaach and Mike Hrynko. -

p' Bemis was forced to decide
between a number of goalies. The
two top choices were Mark
Robertson and Scott Thunberg,
who saw split time in the nets.
Robertson emerged as the only
starter with four games remaining
in the season. Robertson ended the
season with a personal record of
1-4-1 and Thunberg ﬁnished with
a 3-5-1 tally.

Now Bemis and the returning
Panthers contemplate the 1980
season. Optimism can take over,
only if the attitude of the Panther’s
can rise ‘high enough to allow it.
After putting in a 4-9-2 season,
any teamcan developta negative
feeling.

discos and disco’ dancing, I must wonder

discos. Again, where in the city do
dancers “prefer”...Slave, Cameo,” etc?
Ever hear of Donna Summer, Patrick
Hernandez, Sister Sledge or, lately,
Barbra Streisand, to name a few?

Finally, Mr. Stubbs’ comments that
Heaven may be too “plush” for the
“average Pittsburgher” and that most’ of
the city’s dancers are “lower-middle
economic class young Black people”
(Whewl)... Come on! Pandering to two
social misconceptions in one paragraph-
that Pittsburghers have no class and that
Blacks make the best dancers—make it
quite obvious that the article was poorly
researched and painfully biased.

With promotional help like yours,
Heaven is sure to be a bust.

Disco ran
Claims Foul

Mr. Stubbs’ November 14 feature on
Pittsburgh’s new Heaven disco left me
confused and. aggravated. Was he, I
wondered, attempting to write a
commentary (albeit a slanted one) on
disco music, or an advance for the new
disco? Moreover, his comments about

Mr. Stubbs’ remarks (‘ ‘mono-

perpetuate the hard-core" rockiand rollers’
belief that disco music is mindless and
contrived. Sure, disco has a strong,
evident beat and often repeats choruses,
but weren't the same things said about
rock——with much validity—in the ‘50s and
’60s—and even today? There isn’t that
much difference between the two—-wit-
ness the ease with which The Stones and
Donna Summer have performed either.
(Though to marvel at that fact is
ridiculous. It is neither surprise or
sacrilege.)

A ChoiceSe|ection Of Holiday can Book Reviews

EDITORS NOTE: The mystery of the
holiday season seems not to lie in what

' one is going to receive, but what one will

give another as an interesting and useful
present.-e One of the long-standing best
bets for Christmas has always been
books. '

In this week’s issue of SHOWCASE,
we are in keeping with the wishes of our
literature minded readers. Following are
some reviews of both light and heavy
reading with the hopes of appealing to
diverse public taste. For their endurance
and usefulness, books are very mod-
erately priced and make a great gift for

- someone. In the issues ahead, we will

keep with this new aspect of reviewing
books in our attempts at covering as many
areas of the entertainment field as
possible.

Nostalgic 80's

I

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

1 The 80s--A Look Back

Edited by C. Cerf, T. Hendra and
P. Elbling
Workman Publishing

“The Eighties‘--you remember what
happened then,” said Christopher'Cerf.
Thus began one of the most bizarre
conversations ever held, as Cerf, former
National Lampoon Contributing Editor
and co-editor of the new book, “The
80s--A Look Back at the Tumultuous
Decade,” related its contents.

“The book consists of much the same

A type of thing we’re all going to see next

year about the 70s,” Cerf said. The
bizarre part comes with this book, as he
and fellow editors Tony Hendra and Peter
Elbling reconstruct, in prose, picture and
photograph, the events of a decade that
hasn’t yet begun.

Cerf relaxed in his chair. “We thought
it’d be a good idea to do an 80s book,
since everyone will be reading collections
of 70s material. We had to rush a lot to

‘ get it done, but here it is.”

He thumbed through his publication.
“See, you ‘remember this in 1982, when
Disney, Inc. took over bankrupt Britain
and made it a theme. amusement park,
called the ‘United Magic Kingdom’.”
He pointed at a photo, beautifully
“ct vuched, showing Queen Elizabeth on a
horse, with two royal guards next to her.

The guards were wearing Mickey Mouse '

heads, aka Disneyland.

“Or how_ about this,” he pointed.
“Remember when, in response to the
King Tut traveling exhibit, the Great
Wall of China toured the US?” Another
expertly retouched photo. “How about
the hit Musical ‘1984’?” He showed a
poster for the film bearing a cartoon

’ image of Big Brother surrounded by

dancing rats. “Surely you remember the
Oil Glut and the Meat Shortage?”
More photos accompanied by articles
written in “retrospective.” Cerf the

4 whole time acted like he had just taught
his son to talk, or like a small boy who is a-

showing his dog’s new tricks to his
parents.

The'ravings of a drug-crazed madman?
A sicko who should be given shock
treatment?- No, not at all. What Cerf is is
proud of this book; and, as he puts it,
“I’m just a typical Lampoon writer.”

Indeed, many forms of Cerf’ s work will
be familiar to Lampoon fans. The
A_.'U.B.T.D. Newsletter (Americans
United to Beat The Dutch) most notably,
but his name has appeared everywhere
--on Lampoon records, “Saturday Night
Live,” the Lampoon Radio Hour. Last
year he and Hendra collaborated on a
thing called “Not ‘the New York Times,”
an expert ‘parody of the famed
newspaper. ' I

And this production is every bit the
equal -of the old Lampoon. As was said
before, the photos are expertly re-
touched, and include (beside those

geady mentioned). a boxing 'match

. with

CHRISTOPHER CERF‘

between Ali and Begin; the Golden Gate
Bridge spanning across the Hollywood
hills (“the Big Slide of '86, you remember
reading about this, right?” Cerf asked);
and ‘action photos of such sports as
Contact Tennis, Contact Bridge, and the

Kentucky Demolition Derby. There are
hilarious. accounts‘ of the Oil Glut, the
Meat Shortage, the International Year of
the Simultaneous Orgasm (“when every-
one came at once, and the earth moved”),
and so on. ‘

“Nothing is sacred,” said. Cerf. And
this book may offend some because of this
fundamental belief on the parts of the
editors. For example, we have St. Paul's
Condominium (‘‘‘If we can't save souls,
we can at least save on’ rent,’ was the
Catholic response to declining attend-
ance”).
satirically here too, as a photo shows a
Lincoln limousine tumbling over a bridge,
with the caption “The Kennedy In-
augural: Republican Chauffeurs were
blamed for a series of bizarre accidents
such as this. . . .”

All in all, a very hilarious and
powerfully moving piece of work, 263

- pages of whatthe 80s were all about. As

Cerf put it, while autographing a book
“Best Wishes,
11/ 2/ 89"--“The right book for the wrong
time. "’ And as H. Caulﬁeld Stein wrote in
1990, “(With this book Americans .will)
ﬁnd themselves adequately prepared for
the 80s, should they occur again.”

Do you all feel as if you’ve suddenly
aged ten years? .-

Einstein Made I t

Easy

By MARGERY MEYERS

Einstein for Beginners
Schwartz 8; McGulnness
Pantheon/Random House

Despite the possibility that you have
tlunked out of basic algebra three times
going on four, physics is now more
delicious and addicting than your wildest
dreams have allowed. The proof is in the
text of “Einstein For Beginners,” a
collaboration by physics professor Joseph
Schwartz and artistic humorist Michael
McGumness. The book. is an attractive
presentation of the history, trivia, and
calculations leading up to Einstein’s
discovery that the relationship between
energy and inertia is E=mc . The theory
of relativity comes complete with a cast of
characters that would put Vaudeville to
shame. It is a satire of social conformity
and history presented in a cute, soapish
manner. _ _

With the cleverly plotted cartoons
comes a narration that is highly appealing

\

to the lay-person of physics.
mathematical concepts are explained in
an. a'cces_sable way, and the examples
given are sassier and more enjoyable than
the typical text book examples that may

been responsible for massive failure. "It is '
4 possible that ifgtext books were written in »~

this manner, there would be greater
interest in scientiﬁc research, and the
world might be healthier. In fact, at the
end of ‘ ‘Einstein For Beginners, ’ ’ there is
a list for further reading, marked in
degrees of advancement, so that it is

» possible for the reader to pursue the

study of science without gettinglost. I

- After reading about‘, and understand-
ing one of the most important
breakthroughs of the twentieth century,
side-shows and jokes notwithstanding, it
becomes evident that there is poetry in
physics. “Einstein For Beginners”
revolutionizes and refreshes the idea with
a literary genius that will hopefully
become a tradition.“ Put thisbook on your
coffee table,
passers-by develop physics monkeys on
their backs. / 4

For those hearty souls in Pittsburgh '

who desire a comprehensive entertain-
ment schedule but cannot continually

valuable companion to take along on a
night out in Pittsburgh{ An initial
investment of $20--what “Entertainment
’80” costs you--can go a long _way.

The Ghost Writer
By Philip Roth
Farrar Straus Giroux

Twenty years after “Goodbye Colum-
bus,” Philip Roth is still gracing
' bookshelves with his novels. “The Ghost
Writer” is about a writer, Nathan
Zuckerman,. who talks.about his start in
the literary world twenty years ago.

Zuckerman is a youthful, enterprising _

young author whose potential is not
sufﬁciently recognized. He turns to a
ﬁgure of literature who he might call on
for praise, critiquing and guidance.

Zuckerman miraculously gets a reply
from the writer E.I. Lonoff, a man whose
persistence, dedication, and wonderful
writing style Zuckerman has come’ to
admire.

Zuckerman spends a day and a night in
the house of the writer, and through this
experience, aspects of the revered author
are exposed, as are obstacles of the young
Zuckerman, himself.

But Lonoff is still a figure of immense

integrity, a man in control of his environ- '

  ’T he Onion Field’: A Frightening True Murder Story

By PHIL CONTES
The Onion Field ‘
By Hamid Becker
“The Onion Field” is a devastating
movie, depicting an act of horrendous

_ brutality and its equally horrid aftermath.

The plot at first glance seems simple. It
was adapted from a true story by Joseph
Wambaugh. Two small time hoods, Greg

‘ Powell (James Woods) and Jimmy Smith
(Franklyn Seales) are on route to a
robbery when they are detained by rookie

detectives, "Karl Hettinger (John Savage)
and Ian Campbell (Ted Danson). Powell
and Smith manage to overpower the
young cops and kidnap them. They drive

 to an onion ﬁeld where the cops are to be
stranded.

However, in what is a
shockingly spontaneous chain of events

vPowell guns down_ Campbell, while

Hettinger manages to, escape.
/ One might expect a long chase scene or

..._'-..—/ denouement after this climatic moment,

in_keeping with the typical cop movie
H plot. However, this is not a typical cop
movie. Wambaugh would not let
Hollywood distort another of his movies,
as was done with “The Blue Knight” and
A _“The Choirboys.” He formed his own
production company and had full control
over the movie. Only after the capture of
the criminals the real story Wambaugh
wishes to tell begins.
In an act of both stupidity and insen-
sitivity, Hettinger is told he was derelict

’Yanks’ Moves Through Attitudes Of Second

By TOM McGINTY

Yanks
Directed by John Schlesinger

“Yanks” is the title of the latest film

from Director John Schlesinger and is
touted as a “celebration of feeling.’_’ This

may be a farily accurate description.

“Yanks” proliferates with feeling but
lacks any real action and this absence

takes away more than it addseto the
success of the film. Richard Gere (Tony
Lepanto in Looking for Mr. Goodbar)
stars as Matt, a U.S. Army cook who falls
in love with a British shopkeeper, Jean

-turing a world premiere translation by

(Lisa Eichorn). Eichhorn does a superb

job as does William Devane and Vanessa
Redgrave.

Devane plays a lonely
serviceman adrift in Britain during the

second World War, a complete role

change from his performance in
Schlesinger's “Marathon Man.” Red-
grave’s role is that of Helen, a married
woman, bride of a British soldier, who
ﬁnds herself involved with Devane. '

“Yanks” is based primarily on the

in his duty on the tragic night. The
implication that he is responsible for
Campbell’s death follows.

The criminals, though sentenced to
death, manage to postpone the trial and
gain a new trial. Hettinger watches in
increasing frustration as the system fails
to deal with Powell and Smith. He is
constantly forced to recreate the crime in
testimony before new courts. He is
tormented by nightmares, by feelings of
responsibilityand guilt. He begins to
shoplift, a manifestation of his uncon-
scious desire for punishment. Caught, he
resigns from the police force. He deter-
iorates physically as well as mentally; he
becomes a forgotten man. In one
especially poignant. scene lawyers, and
judges discuss his mental condition in

front of him, as if he were not there. ‘

Consumed by totalguilt, he is driven to
the brink of suicide, brought back only by
the love of his wife and family. \

‘But Wambaugh does not stop there. He
shows us the brutal dehumanization of
the prisoners on death row. In one scene
a prisoner slits his wrists, only to be
saved by the guards so that he can be
executed the next day.

Wambaugh shows us a system which
sacrifices justice to the legal process. A
process which devours even its own.

for eight years, becoming the longest trial

In, an intense scene from ‘The Onion Field,’ Gregory Powell (James
Woods) hglds plainclothes police officer Ian Cambell (Ted Danson) at

gunpoint

in California history. One remarks -that
he would gladly set Powell and Smith free
if only he could send some judges and

lawyers to the gas chamber.

John Savage turns in a superb perfor-

mance as the silent, intense Hettinger. '

He is unable to verbalize his feelings, but
his torment is visualized with each ner-
vous jerk of the head, each compulsive
move, each increasingly violent act.
James Woods overcomes an almost too
comic initial portrayal of Powell, making
the audience believe in his demented,.
almost demonic power over the weak-
willed Smith. He then brings a touch of
humanity to his character making him
more than just an evil archetype. It is

feelings the characters have for each

the British have for the Americans. The
.opinion of the British at the time
“Yanks” was set can best be summed by
the popular saying, “The Yanks are over
paid, oversexed and over here.” This
theme continues throughout the movie
and at times it is the only thing that holds
it together. One interesting contrast in

Michael Henry Heim, this is the second

Written in 1895, “The Seagull” is
the second of Chekhov’s four master-

Cherry Orchard”). It is a story about

the artistic elite of «the pre-revolution

“Yanks” is the differences in the
relationships that develop. Devane and
Redgrave have a mature partnership,
each satisfied to share the other’s
company. The idea of lasting love never
really materializes. Gere and Eichhorn,
however, find themselves compelled, to
have each other despite the outside
pressures placed on them by the war, the

impossible to sympathize or perhaps even
to understand Powell’s actions, but
Wood's interpretation of the role makes
Powell real.

There is not one mis-cast or weak per-
formance in this picture. Director Harold
Becker is able to maintain a high level of
intensity throughout this complex movie.
Occasionally, Wambaugh adds 3, scene
which seems undeveloped, or perhaps not
adequately set up. We are led inexorably
'to his central question: Which is worse?
An instantaneous act of criminal
brutality, or a society which system-
atically brutalizes both the criminal and
the innocent? ’

“Yanks” . has its moments when it
appears that something tremendous is
about to happen but that moment refuses
to occur. Instead the movie flows along
and continues to develop until the end.
The only thing that gets resolved is the
affair between Devane and Redgrave.
Schlesinger seems determined to concen-
trate on the emotions of the audience and
tries to bring about a mixture of humor,
anger, resentment and happiness. How—.
ever, the main reactions that result from
“Yanks” are initial hope and anticipa-
tion, but eventually a feeling of
complacency overrides them and the
audience leaves the theater with the
empty feeling that nothing had happen-
ed. . ‘

Although “Yanks” has no display of
the typical blood-and-guts war action, it
still comes off as another war picture,

only this one focuses on'the war between '

individuals as well as the war between
nations. Commercially, “Yanks” will
succeed only marginally but for Schles-
inger it is already a personal success.

Christmas Gifts At The
Arts And Crafts Center

(Continued from page 3)

holiday spirit is everywhere, with
scores of handmade wreaths lining
the halls, walls of tree ornaments
and hot apple cider.‘

There are paintings, prints,
photographs, sculptures, hand
blown glass, weaving, pillows,\
ponchos, jewelry and a large
selection of ceramic works. There
are painted screens/ room dividers,
woven chairs, hexagon shaped
glass terrariums and a couple of
outrageous ceramic'dragon
marionettes. Cookbooks,
calenders, bells and haircombs can
be had for a triﬂe.

John Seitz, Director of Sales for
the Center, says, “Some of the
things we’re selling could be pur-

chased at department stores, like
the tea pots and cookware, at a
comparable price, but our
handcrafted items offer better
quality and designs that you can’t
find anywhere else. And because
they’re handcrafted, people enjoy
them better, the personal touch, '
the laying on of hands. When you
get a casserole dish from us, each
one is a little different.”

Most of the items are priced
reasonably. There’s plenty to
choose from—and they’re all
objects of art and uncommon gifts.
The volunteers who will be working
the sale are constantly replenishing
the stock, so everyday, there’s
something different to choose
from.

Roth's ’Writer’ i

. (Continued from page _4)

Besides Lonoff, there is his wife, Hope,
a woman who has spent 35 years of her
life with the man, and has never seen, nor
ever expects to see, , ‘anything ever
And Amy, one of Lonoff’s old
students, is also staying in the house, and
her involvement goes a bit deeper than
just student, as Zucker'man’s eaves-
droppings lets him know.

Roth portrays Zucker-‘man as an
intuitive character,- a young writer
searching for a base, a starting point of
inspiration. His own imagination and
ideas surface in a rather bizarre way as
Roth weaves a delicate, interesting story.
The attitudes and perceptions are
uniquely Roth, not just resembling works
of the past, but using them as a .
springboard. - ‘

‘ ‘The Ghost Writer” contains a number
of perspective ideas; Zuckerman as the
writer, Zuckerman as the student,
Zuckerman as a -member of a proud
Jewish family. All these things seem to
conﬂict with each other, in Zuckerman’s
But actually, Roth helps weave
them together, to make them compliment
each other and work toward the common
goal of Zuckerman. , _

In the end,‘ nothing iswopenly resolved
to Zuckerman. The world around him and
his writing has not changed monument-
ally. The only tie-in is what he will do

H with the experience, and how he will view

those things around him afterwards.
Roth clearly has made_'a ﬁne literary

contribution with “The Ghost Writer.”

What the future holds for him and his

\ writing is.something that should prove

- interesting.

a Birthday For

HappyvBirthday, Charlie Brown

Lee Mendelson in -association with

Random House

.4

Thirty years_ago, it all started with a C

(72 strip called‘.“Li’l Folks”. by Sparky.

Today, it has progressed into thousands

 

_—"
of comic strips, ﬁfteen years worth of
television shows, and ten years worth of
movies. It has been inbred into American
culture, as well as being recongnized

around the world as the most read and V
’ successful comic strip. The characters of

“Peanuts” have been seen from greeting
cards to satellite pictures from Apollo
space ﬂights. In tune with the
anniversary, TV-film producer Lee
Mendelson and strip creator Charles M.
Schulz have ‘put together ‘ a short
anthology of progression from the first
days until the present with, “Happy
Birthday, Charlie Brown.” -

The book is choicetmaterial, covering
“Peanuts” from its earliest days. It
shows their climb to the top of the comic
ladder, with original selections through
their maturity until they have reached the
stage they are at today?

One of the most amazing things about
“Peanuts” is Schulz. After thirty years

of the strip, he still does everything
himself, from sketching to coloring to
lettering. And it obviously shows in the
continuing quality of theistrip each year.-'

The book takes the reader not only
through the process of creating the lives
of _“Peanuts” but also through’ the
process of creating them. It is sectioned
off into different phases in the strips
history. With an, introduction and
background on all the major characters
and how they got their start.

Included in these are some of Schulz’s
_favorite strips from his thirty years.

- Many, indeed, are classic “Peanuts.” .

The book also explores Schulz himself,

. a single man who, in thirty years, has_

given America and the rest of the world
over ten thousand strips and ﬁfty
thousand sketches. Mendelson gives us
some insight into the man, and, some of
his inspirations for the thousands of ideas
he has incorporated in his comics.

V Mendelson then moves on to his major

aspect of the development of “Peanuts,”

television and ﬁlm exposure. Not only
does the book include stills of the most

famous specials, like “A Charlie Brown_

Christmas,” and ‘‘It’s the Great
Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,” but the
technique that is behind these classics.
The only disappointing part of the book
is that itlhas to end. “Peanuts” are
infectious. The strips and sketches
included are probably some of the best
that Schulz has ever done, but they are

too few to satisfy the taste of the reader ~

who will not be able to put thislbook
down. , -

Put out in perfect time for Christmas,
“Happy Birthday, Charlie Brown” is_ an
excellent gift. It is also a ﬁne tribute to
the man who has taken America by storm
in the dast thirty years and made
“Peanuts” a pleasant part of our culture.

Murphy's ’Vicar’

, ’ By PHIL CONTES

The Vicar of Christ
WaltereF. Murphy
MacMillan

From marine commander and war
Hero, to Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, to the Ponﬁff of the Roman
Catholic Church, this is the. journey on
which one Declan Patrick Walsh travels in
the _novel, “The ,Vicar of Christ” by
Walter P. Murphy. Murphy is able in this
most impressive first offering, to make
this implausible series of events totally
believable.

The novel is divided into three main
sections which are the told histories of
three of ‘Walsh’s close friends and
associates. In the ﬁrst‘ section we are
introduced to Master Seargeant Giuseppe
Michelangelo Guicciardini. Murphy may
overdo the leatherneck’s cliched lan-
guage, but ‘fGun, ”,_,%as he is known by
the other chara3 ‘iis still one of the
most appealing personalities in the book.
In Korea, Walsh must order the bombing
of an enemy-occupied hill—while some of

- his best friends are still on‘ it. When

Walsh’s'platoo'n retakes the hill, he ﬁnds
his friends killed in the bombing he

ordered. Walsh is almost shattered by ,,

this, but recovers and is able to heroically
lead his men. through heavily enemy-
occupied Korea. Walsh however is
constantly tormented by the memory.
In the second section" of the book the
character of C. ~ Bradley Walker, as
associate justice of the Supreme Court, is

introduced. And although Murphy, who.

is also a political scientist when he is not
writing novel_‘_'s',-manages to give us some
in depth‘ analysisof the way in which the
Supreme’ Court operates. ‘ This section of
the book becomes just a bit long and
tedious, partly because Murphy succeeds
in making Walker such a detestable
character. ’ Walker's stilted conversa-
tional style reveals him ‘to be both
pompous and pretentious. He is a
malicious gossip who preceeds his juicest

tidbits by saying ‘‘I have absolutely no
use for gossip but...” Still, the
complexities of Walsh’s character are
revealed. Constantly driven to excel, he

‘neglects his wife and she becomes an

alcoholic. He takes on a lover, realizes
his immorality and leaves her, but not
before his wife is killed in a car crash
coming home alone from a ‘ party.
Plagued by guilt for both this incident,
and the responsibility he still feels for the
deaths in Korea, Walsh totally withdraws
from" public life, joining a Trappist
monestary. ,

In the ﬁnal ection, Ugo Cardinal
Galeotti is introdtfbed. Galeotti has been
Walsh’s constant friend, conﬁdant and
advisor. He is a humble man,\a gourmet,
or perhaps gourmand, who has an
uncanny ability to remember each dish of
a meal from years ago. If he hadbeen at
the Last Supper his gospel would have
included a menu. At a deadlocked
conclave to determine a new Pope,
galeotti becomes preoccupied ‘with
‘thoughts of his friend Declan Walsh.
Taking this as a sign of divine inspiration,
Galeotti nominates Walsh, who "to his
suprise is conﬁrmed. This is only a
further indication of Walsh’s divine
mission, Galeotti feels.

Walsh takes on the name Francesco, I
but only gradually does the transfor-'

mation from secular man to divine leader
take place. Walsh had learned his
lessons well. A ﬁrst he must rule much as

-a military commandar does, by power of

authority only. Gradually he is able to
win ‘consensus on his views. He
circumvents the Humanae Vitae doctrine
against birth control by ‘ offering a_
different interpretation, as is often done
in the Supreme Court. But it is only when

Walsh/ Francesco begins to take on truly '-
divine authority that his crusading nature '

comes into effect. He begins a crusade
for social justice, ignoring secular
authority. - He begins to doubt the
morality of war, then publicly broadcasts
his views of its immorality. His crusades,
his honesty, his message begin to take
real effect. He gives millions new hope.
He becomes a threat to world political
global order.

still shocking and tragic.

Above all the book is about the uses
and abuses of power in this world. The
arenas may be different but the methods
are often the same. The central question:
Can one good man change the world? The
last to do so was Jesus Christ.

As such, his survival is’
endangered. The ending is expected, but .

    A Rebuilt ’Starship’ iWithA Pittsburgh Destination

By scorr Mowmr

The Jefferson Starship, one of
America's most creative and legendary
rock bands, have to be regarded as the

most enduring and self-perpetuating ,

groups in modern day music.

Throughout its volatile 15-year exist-'
ence, the Starship/ Airplane have demon-
strated -an incredible ability to rebound
when-‘things looked their worst and to
rejuvinate themselves and their music
while continually broadening thier
following, record sales and concepts. The
stimulus seems to come from the
numerous personell shifts the band has
been forced to undergo for various
external and internal reasons. To date, a
total of 18 separate members have been a
part of the “family,” since the Airplane
was founded back in 1965.

When the Starship touches down at the
Stanley Theatre next week on November
27th, the group will once again debut a
revised line-up.

Gone are the diverse talents of
singers/songwriters Grace Slick and
Marty Balin. What’s left behind is the
bare bones of a powerful and straight-

forward rock sound.

“We are deﬁnitely after a different
sound now. We are heading in a heavier,
more harder rock direction,” guitarist
Craig Chaquico said recently in a phone

‘conversation from Boston while on the

"group's current American tour.
The additions of vocalist Mickey
Thomas and drummer Aynsley Dunbar
plus -a revitalized attitude by the four
zremaining Starship crew, Chaqu-ico, Paul
Kantner, David Freiberg and Pete Sears,
have beenthe factors largely responsible
for the band’s fresh approach to their
music. The latest album, “Freedom At
Point‘Zero,” releasedrjust three weeks
ago, points to an energized direction that
ﬁnds the new Starshiphoning its hard
rock chops. A
f‘Our goal when we ﬁnally got
everything together was to play the music
we had fun playing and the audience
would enjoy hearing,”
ﬁxture with the Starship overthe past ﬁve

_ albums, since 1974, explainedwith great

enthusiasm. ' ,

“This is the ﬁrst band I’ve played in
where I’m really enjoying myself,” he
added. “We are really happy with the

way“thi»ngs— are going and everyone is

“anxious to play.”
‘But not long ago, the future looked very
bleak fo the Jefferson Starship. The year
"1978 was probably the stormiest of the

'band’s‘history. In the midst of a bizarre

‘European tour during the summer, the
*group had to cancel their appearance at
"the Lorley Festival in St. Goarshausen,
Germany. Their cancellation, caused by a
Slick intestinal ailment, provoked some
12,000 people to riot and demolish $1
million of stage and sound equipment.

Two days later, Grace Slick resigned from

the groupand told ROLLING STONE, “Ii

Prairie League Stomps Duquesneln ACountry Rock Show

By TOM McGINTY
Pure Prairie League
Duquesne University
November 15th, 1979

Pure Prairie League visited the ‘ ‘City of
Champions” recently in an under-

"publicized performance at Duquesne’s

Student Union Ballroom, a rather
innocuous location for one of country
rock’s more popular groups. The
intimate. atmosphere was conducive for

' both fspontaneous ‘ excitement and per-

sonal entertainment. The small
enthusiastic crowd was sparsely dotted
with cowboy hats and bandan-as. Clearly,
everyone in attendance was up for a
down-home, foot-stompin’ good time.

Pure Prairie League opened up with
“Kansas City Southern,” an old favorite
from their “Two Lane Highway” album.
A few newer tunes passed without
incident until “Can’t Hold Back My Love
For You,” also a new song but the best
effort to this point of the concert. It was
the first of only a few times that the band
allowed themselves to stray from their
studio style. Each musician had the
opportunity to show what they can do but
the obvious standout was George Ed
Powell whose vocals are as distinctive as
the music itself. He shined throughout
the evening, displaying.his talents on
rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, electric
lead guitar : and violin. Other ﬁne
performances were given by Mike Reilly
on bass guitar and backup vocals, Billy
Hinus on drums and Larry Goshorn on
lead and slideguitar and vocals.

The concert was’ rolling along well
enough, the band was playing well but
the audience became somewhat listless

‘ and applauded only half-heartedly while

chanting “Amy Amy! . When Pure Prairie
League ﬁnally played “Amy,” the crowd

responded as if given a second wind.~ .

With the crowd back with them, the band
poured it on with three strong and rowdy
songs,‘ “Pickin’ To Beat The Devil,”
‘‘That’ll Be The Day” and “Two Lane
Highway.” During “Pickin’,” the
six musicians played no less than eleven
instruments.

After sixteen songs, the group was

‘greeted with an enthusiastic ovation, but

Powell obviously felt the crowd should
have been louder and blurted out,
“C’mon, we’ve been workin’ our asses
off up here, let’s hear it! ” This display of
dissatisfaction by Powell only increased
the applause temporarily but sufficiently
to bring back Pure Pfairie League for two
brief encores.

It’s no secret that the crowd plays a
major part in the success and the
excitement that is generated at a concert.
The performers have a responsibility as
well, to give the best concert they can for
those who decide to support them. When
either of these aspects are not fully met,
both the performers and the audience
suffer. The performers suffer with an
unresponsive crowd while the audience
suffers with a dull and stock performance.
This appears to .have been the problem
Thursday night. The evening, which
-could have been a special and memorable

experience for those of us present, never
developed. Instead, the problems were
too great to go unnoticed and_ the possible
magic was gone. 1 Perhaps those who

promoted « this concert will ‘ see the
problems and rectify them. It could mean
the difference between a good show and a
great one.

Encore ||.Plays Host
1 To Jazz's Stitt

By PHIL CONTES
Sonnie Stitt  ’

Encore II
November 12-17, 1979

Renowned saxaphonist Sonny ‘Stitt was

I obviously ill when he took the stage on

Saturday night at the Encore downtown.
‘.‘A touch of ﬂu, but with your help.” The
audience knew its role and gave Sonny a
warm welcome. Requests ﬁlled the air
and Stitt did his best to comply, playing
such standards as “The Shadow of Your

Smile,” “AutumnVLeaves,” and “Star-

dust,” all with some very hot improvisti-

ational licks from Stitt’s sax. After a few:
numbers Stitt had to be helped from the

stage, but drew a warm ovation.

The Kawasai Jayourba Quartet, Stitt’s
back-up, for the shows which started on
Wednesday played a few arrangements of
their own. The quartet consisting of
Kawasi Jayourba on conga’s, Stu Smith
on drums, Larry Beile on ‘keyboards, and
Chipper Joe Grey on bass, has a
Latin-Jamaican jazz sound to it. Beile’s
keyboard style is similar to that of
vibra-phonist Cal Tjader. All evening
Jayourba, of Jaimaican and Liberian

parentage, had built up a warm
relationship with the audience, so. ;the
quartet’s music‘ was enthusiastically —~
received. ,

The boisterous near-capacity crowd
gave Stitt a welcome which buoyed his
spirits when he came on for the second
set. Stitt called one of his students, Lance
Parker, on stage and the two combined
for some inspiring sax duets. .

Especially stirring was the swinging “I
Got Rhythm,” on which Stitt seemed to
really come alive.

Afterpcalling for an ovation for Parker ,

L and the quartet, Stitt again left the stage, ‘ ‘

to another” very appreciative ovation.’ The
quartet concluded the set with a driving,
powerful rendition of “Caravan,” show-
ing they could handle a lot more than just,
cool Jamaican rhythms. ’ '

The Kawasai J ayourba Quartet will be
appearing Nov. 21, 29 and 30, and Dec. 1,~_
Vocalist "Brenda Jones will appear Nov.
22-24,. Bobby Davis, manager of the
Encore, expects to run Saturday
afternoon jazz matinees through Decem-
ber, due to the success ofhis evening jazz ,
shows. '

to draw_ the borders of the “ideal
country” in which he would like to live.
All of us have dreams about where we

would like to live. Iwan is trying to bring
about his country about through the
Welsh language and his songs recount

this effort from school days to the A

attempts of others to achieve their
“country.” This man’s message of his

   Pitt Hosts Leon Bates In Classical Music Performance

. situation would be a compromise

between teaching and performing.
Personal contact with the audience
makes them more comfortable. I
wouldn’t leave the concert circuit to

devote all of my time» to broaden the

exposure of classical‘ music, because

.. /there are people who enjoy the formal
 setting where the performer plays the
E ' concert, takes his bows, and leaves.”

These comments were made by Bates

 during the receptioin held by the Pitt

Union Program Council after the
concert. The main course was Bates’
performance and after three standing

ovations, anything else was sure to be

lackluster and least remembered. In

, interviewing Bates,‘ his comments were

articulate, and as well composed as the
music he played. _
, Bates has a notable way of

-performing, in that as he played each.

in place the phrases in his mind. He
proceeded from there to project the

melodies—frorn strong and dramatic,
to light and reposed—making the
audience lose track of the time and sit
anxiously on the edge of their seats to
hear the next notes, the next measure,
the next piece. j

The food and drink at the reception
was befitting of the concert. The
audience was allowed to speak to Bates
after the concert and better understand
what drives this individual to play for
and give instructional workshops to
college audiences.

Rise Kaplan, a member of the
program council's cultural committee,
made clear .her feelings of dissatis-
faction in regard to the fair turnout.

“It can really be frustrating to see
such low student participation at
cultural events, especially when they
are as excellent as the Leon Bates
program. However, I’m sure the
people that did come really enjoyed
themselves and were involved in it and
that’s what’s important,” 'Kaplan
said. .‘‘I think if more students who
didn’t have the experience of classical
music came, they would have been in

for a real treat. There is more to life
than rock concerts and beer parties.
People don’t take advantage of
cultural events. I feel bad that they’re
missing out on it. What we try to do is
promote cultural events and all we can
do is hope that more people will
respond,” she said.

The cheeses and punch served at the

reception were a great ending to the P
. evening. It ranked a distant second to _

Bates’ performance. If you were there,
you were one of the lucky ones. If you
weren’t you missed something that will

be remembered for a long time to.

’Dream Deferrd?’ Examines
Plight Of Black Americans:

By D. ELISHA STUBBS

/
What Happens to a Dream Deferred?

' Arranged and Directed by Vemell Lillie

On Wednesday, Nov. 14th, the Black
Action Society’s 10th Annual Black Week
presented the Black Studies- Depart-
ment’s “Kundu Repertory Theatre.” The
name of the presentation was “What
Happensto a Dream Deferred?” The.
collection of skits, poems, short stories,
historic speeches and comedy was
arranged and directed by Black Studies,
Vernell Lillie. I --

“What Happens to a Dream Defer-

- red?” is a broad presentation which

examines the history and plight of black
people in America from the early‘
existence of slave trade to the modern day
struggles of identity and discrimination.
“Kundu” is performed by ten people,
with a presentation consisting of 22

different segments divided into ﬁve
parts. Though the performance was
highly emotional, the logical progression
of the presentation was ﬂawless.

The material used for the presentation
was unbelievable. Works by Langston
Hughes, Frederick Douglass, Booker T.
Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus
Garvey, Malcolm X, James Baldwin,
Amiri'Baraka and Martin Luther King are
a few of the featured artists in “Kundu.”

The “Kundu Repertory Theatre”

raises some serious questions about the

United States and its endlessly hypo-
critical policies concerning black people.
“What Happens to a Dream Defer-

V red?” is a perfect example of the effec-
tiveness of free form theater.
performance provided a great blend of .

The

entertainment and ‘education. It guaran-

teed that those who came to see and hear '

this ‘presentation learned more about
Black Americans than they knew before
they came in. ' ‘
