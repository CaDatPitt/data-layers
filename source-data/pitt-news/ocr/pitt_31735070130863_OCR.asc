As the extended race for ballot counting entered its 10th
day on Friday, F1orida’s unofﬁcial tally of overseas absentees
votes showed Gov. George W. Bush leading Vice President

, Al Gore by 930 votes.

Despite the governor’s lead, Republicans still charged
Democrats with disqualifying hundreds of absentee ballots

‘ unfairly.

The Florida Supreme Court also ruled that Secretary of
State "Katherine Harris was prohibited fromﬂcyertifying the
votes, which is why a winner still remains undetermined.

Harris had originally forced counties completing manual

recounts to submit’ her written statements of explanation.
Upon their receipt, Harris found none to be valid. She was
‘expected to announce Bush as the winner afterithe absentee

ballot tally returned in his favor, but couldn’t after the I

 =-Supreme Court"s ruling. ‘ T

Today the court will decide whether or not Harris was
right in not allowing the recounts to count in the ﬁnal vote.
